[00:00.000 --> 00:01.300]  Reaching the Conditioning!
[00:01.300 --> 00:02.400]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:02.400 --> 00:03.200]  Alex Jones.
[00:03.200 --> 00:04.000]  Alex Jones.
[00:04.000 --> 00:04.800]  Alex Jones.
[00:04.800 --> 00:07.800]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:07.800 --> 00:12.800]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by
[00:12.800 --> 00:17.300]  changing its algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:17.300 --> 00:19.200]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:19.200 --> 00:24.400]  It's probably confirmed there are recent shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[00:24.400 --> 00:28.600]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:28.600 --> 00:31.800]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[00:31.800 --> 00:34.800]  It was almost as if this was a planned impulsion.
[00:34.800 --> 00:36.800]  It just panicked.
[00:36.800 --> 00:38.800]  They took the babies out of the incubators.
[00:38.800 --> 00:41.600]  I'm not going to jump in without a cold bath.
[00:41.600 --> 00:43.700]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[00:43.700 --> 00:47.600]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[00:47.600 --> 00:50.800]  Operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:50.800 --> 00:52.000]  UFOs.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.200]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:54.200 --> 00:55.200]  Is it one world?
[00:55.200 --> 00:56.600]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:56.600 --> 00:59.000]  Israel claims the fact was accidental.
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.200]  Some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:02.200 --> 01:05.600]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[01:05.600 --> 01:11.200]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:11.200 --> 01:12.800]  Russian stuff.
[01:12.800 --> 01:13.800]  Denied everything.
[01:13.800 --> 01:15.000]  He called it all fake news.
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.200]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:18.200 --> 01:20.000]  This is a national emergency.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.800]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:25.800 --> 01:29.800]  This is a female high-level emergency.
[01:29.800 --> 01:31.400]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:31.400 --> 01:37.200]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and which leaks?
[01:37.200 --> 01:40.000]  The White House and the president are citing info wars.
[01:40.000 --> 01:41.200]  They can shut us down.
[01:41.200 --> 01:42.800]  You're next.
[01:42.800 --> 01:47.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47.600 --> 01:50.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:50.400 --> 01:57.200]  Okay, if you go to info wars.com or news wars.com, you'll see the headline memo release developing.
[01:57.200 --> 02:01.400]  And then you'll link to a story we have that's basically a placeholder.
[02:01.400 --> 02:05.000]  That's what the Washington Examiner has done, which is fine.
[02:05.000 --> 02:14.000]  They basically repeat what Congressman Gowdy has said and what Congressman Nunes has said, Chairman Nunes and what Congressman Gates has said on the show.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.400]  And exactly what we've said is in the memo, but they announced it's being released.
[02:19.400 --> 02:26.200]  But our sources said about 15 minutes ago that it'd be in the next hour.
[02:26.200 --> 02:36.200]  So as we speak, it is going out and it's whoever scans it first and puts it up on the internet first.
[02:36.200 --> 02:37.200]  I don't care either way.
[02:37.200 --> 02:46.600]  I just want to get it out very, very, very quickly before they stage some false flag or something because they have been in full panic mode.
[02:46.600 --> 02:57.800]  FISA memo leak McCabe admits FBI used bogus steel dossier paid for by Hillary to obtain FISA warrant to spy on Trump.
[02:57.800 --> 03:08.400]  Now, what did I tell you the memo was based on the memo that was declassified by the FISA court reporting three times that they believed what the FBI was asking for.
[03:08.400 --> 03:13.800]  The Justice Department was asking for was illegal and that is indeed cited in the memo.
[03:13.800 --> 03:16.000]  That's the big tamale.
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.400]  That's the big enchilada right there.
[03:18.400 --> 03:24.700]  And this is just a roadmap and the House officially saying you had an insurance policy.
[03:24.700 --> 03:26.100]  You had a secret society.
[03:26.100 --> 03:30.400]  You met with McCabe to fix the intelligence, the deputy director.
[03:30.400 --> 03:43.700]  You went on and on and on and on and on with these attempts and never stopped, never back down and just kept pumping the lie about all this.
[03:43.700 --> 03:52.500]  And so now the media is learning the details of what's in the documents and they're printing me the articles as fast as they come in.
[03:52.500 --> 03:57.900]  If you're driving down the road, you're 18 whaler listening to us, you know, you're at the gym or whatever.
[03:57.900 --> 04:03.600]  We will we will we will read out all the information as it comes in stocks or spook.
[04:03.600 --> 04:16.300]  Outfalls 400 points from a tax integrity, the FBI, the Justice Department politicized probe in favor of Dems memo released dot dot dot developing dot dot dot details details.
[04:16.300 --> 04:24.600]  That is the drudge report as the media scrabbles and talks to members of Congress as the memo begins to go out.
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.100]  You will then see the articles developing.
[04:28.100 --> 04:37.000]  That's not what we did when the former head of the NSA pointed out that, hey, this this whole memo, except for the excise parts is in plain view.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.900]  We just posted the whole thing.
[04:38.900 --> 04:46.300]  But what a lot of media will do is as they get it, and I think it's clear that some of these Washington based groups that are on the hill now have it.
[04:46.300 --> 04:49.700]  They are writing articles about it instead of just publishing the memo.
[04:49.700 --> 04:52.200]  So the race is on to publish the memo.
[04:52.200 --> 04:53.000]  Check our email.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.100]  I know Watson's on stones on it.
[04:55.100 --> 05:00.200]  We're told it's becoming in any minute and just post it directly the second it comes in.
[05:00.200 --> 05:01.200]  Frank in North Carolina.
[05:01.200 --> 05:02.300]  Thanks for holding so long.
[05:02.300 --> 05:02.900]  Go ahead.
[05:02.900 --> 05:05.200]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[05:05.200 --> 05:09.000]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.400]  It just gets old now.
[05:10.400 --> 05:11.900]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[05:11.900 --> 05:12.800]  Okay.
[05:12.800 --> 05:15.200]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[05:15.200 --> 05:19.700]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[05:19.700 --> 05:24.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm if that was happening to anybody else?
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.200]  I'd be freaked out.
[05:25.200 --> 05:27.600]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[05:27.600 --> 05:29.200]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[05:29.200 --> 05:30.200]  You know what, Alex?
[05:30.200 --> 05:31.500]  Hey, I'm going to pause again.
[05:31.500 --> 05:36.100]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear?
[05:36.100 --> 05:37.100]  We're under attack.
[05:37.100 --> 05:38.000]  We need your help.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.500]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[05:42.500 --> 05:45.700]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[05:45.700 --> 05:46.100]  You understand?
[05:46.100 --> 05:47.700]  I need your help, Frank.
[05:47.700 --> 05:49.900]  I need your help, Frank.
[05:49.900 --> 05:55.500]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info War.
[05:55.500 --> 05:57.900]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[05:57.900 --> 06:23.900]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[06:28.400 --> 06:35.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, dredgerport.com, infowars.com, newswars.com are all on the cutting edge right
[06:35.700 --> 06:42.600]  now as the memo in the last 20 minutes got released by Congress.
[06:42.600 --> 06:48.100]  But it's been released to media sources that are on the Hill first, and I guess they decided
[06:48.100 --> 06:52.600]  to write articles about what they've got in the memo rather than just put the memo out.
[06:52.600 --> 06:59.400]  But it'll just be minutes, we're told, 10 minutes to an hour until it is posted on the
[06:59.400 --> 07:05.800]  House Intelligence Community website for the House of Representatives.
[07:05.800 --> 07:09.200]  So the House Intelligence Committee will be publishing that.
[07:09.200 --> 07:15.540]  We're told by Congressional sources in the hour, and that was about 20 minutes ago.
[07:15.540 --> 07:21.080]  So we will be following that, and the second it gets published, the memo itself, we will
[07:21.080 --> 07:24.020]  publish the memo, and we will read the memo.
[07:24.020 --> 07:28.880]  Obviously, a lot of media outlets have run with memo released, and then you go and there's
[07:28.880 --> 07:30.560]  just placeholders.
[07:30.560 --> 07:35.240]  That's what Fox News has done, it's what True Pundits done, it's what Washington examiners
[07:35.240 --> 07:36.240]  done, and that's fine.
[07:36.240 --> 07:40.080]  We've done it as well at infowars.com.
[07:40.080 --> 07:45.160]  But as we add to the article, we're giving some of the backstory of last week when we
[07:45.160 --> 07:50.960]  published, to get media attention, it was on the Director of National Intelligence own website,
[07:50.960 --> 08:00.760]  got no media coverage, that there was a 99-page document, and that the excise parts are the
[08:00.760 --> 08:05.760]  roadmap of who called for it, who did it, and so that is now indeed reportedly in that
[08:05.760 --> 08:07.480]  memo as we said.
[08:07.480 --> 08:12.840]  But we know it is horrified the Democrats, let's go ahead and go live to the President
[08:12.840 --> 08:16.840]  or we can back it up to where it started, the President is discussing the memo released
[08:16.840 --> 08:22.240]  on Fox News right now, so we will go ahead and go to the President.
[08:22.240 --> 08:27.880]  He's declassified, Congress will do whatever they're going to do, but I think it's a disgrace
[08:27.880 --> 08:29.560]  what's happening in our country.
[08:29.560 --> 08:35.560]  And when you look at that, and you see that, and so many other things, what's going on,
[08:35.560 --> 08:40.320]  a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves, and much worse than that.
[08:40.320 --> 08:44.160]  So I sent it over to Congress, they will do what they're going to do, whatever they do
[08:44.160 --> 08:49.280]  is fine, it was declassified, and let's see what happens.
[08:49.280 --> 08:54.400]  But a lot of people should be ashamed, thank you very much.
[08:54.400 --> 09:00.920]  Thank you very much.
[09:00.920 --> 09:03.400]  You figure that one out.
[09:03.400 --> 09:07.280]  I don't think so.
[09:07.280 --> 09:12.520]  These are just great people that have suffered incredibly, there were many, many others like
[09:12.520 --> 09:18.880]  them that have suffered so much, and they were here and I said, let's tell you a story
[09:18.880 --> 09:24.560]  very quickly, we have others in a different room as I told you that are really petrified
[09:24.560 --> 09:26.760]  to be here, petrified.
[09:26.760 --> 09:29.960]  So it's tough stuff, it's tough stuff.
[09:29.960 --> 09:36.000]  Mr. President, do you believe there's more United States to do, how more afraid of petrification?
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.520]  Well we're doing a lot, we've done more than, I mean we have many administrations that should
[09:41.520 --> 09:48.320]  have acted on this a long time ago, when it wasn't at this kind of a, when we were in
[09:48.320 --> 09:52.960]  this kind of a position, you know, we ran out of road, you know the expression, the
[09:52.960 --> 09:57.000]  road really ended, they could have done it 12 years ago, they could have done it 20 years
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.600]  ago, they could have done it 4 years ago and 2 years ago.
[10:00.600 --> 10:06.840]  We'll come back with more if it gets into the memo, here's the issue, as we told you,
[10:06.840 --> 10:10.520]  as Congressman Gates told you here on this broadcast and as other congressional sources
[10:10.520 --> 10:18.280]  told you, it is a roadmap of Congress and of the Intelligence Committee saying we found
[10:18.280 --> 10:24.680]  that they premeditatedly lied, made up Russian collusion, created a fake dossier, paid money
[10:24.680 --> 10:32.880]  for it and we have witnesses, we have FBI agents that are ready to go public, the Steal
[10:32.880 --> 10:40.400]  Dossier formed an essential part of the initial and all three renewals of FISA applications
[10:40.400 --> 10:44.120]  against Carter Page, the media thinks you're dumb, they spend it, who cares about Carter
[10:44.120 --> 10:50.880]  Page and a wiretap on him, because that FISA memo isn't a classic wiretap, it's to spy
[10:50.880 --> 10:57.440]  on millions of people in a dragnet, that's what they do with these FISA situations.
[10:57.440 --> 11:02.440]  Andrew McCabe confirmed that no FISA warrant would have been sought from the FISA court
[11:02.440 --> 11:07.680]  without the Steal Dossier information, yeah the word is McCabe is singing like a canary,
[11:07.680 --> 11:12.480]  the political origins of the Steal Dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials
[11:12.480 --> 11:20.320]  but excluded from the FISA applications, oh they didn't tell them that, the DOJ official
[11:20.320 --> 11:26.000]  Bruce Orr met with Steal, remember his wife worked at Fusion GPS just for the job, she
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.200]  just got hired for the dossier, beginning in the summer of 2016 and relayed to DOJ information
[11:31.200 --> 11:36.080]  about Steal's bias, Steal told Orr that he Steal was desperate that Donald Trump not
[11:36.080 --> 11:44.000]  get elected president and was passionate about him not becoming president which is more communications,
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.120]  more witnesses in the FBI, not just text messages now, not just him talking to his girlfriend
[11:49.120 --> 11:56.720]  or somebody talking to his wife or not just Orr talking to his wife at Fusion GPS but directly
[11:58.560 --> 12:04.080]  talking to McCabe and others about this situation and how they wanted to stop Trump.
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.680]  So the president says a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves, it's beyond that,
[12:11.680 --> 12:17.760]  they're trying to steal our election, they're trying to steal our votes, every vote for Trump
[12:17.760 --> 12:21.600]  they're trying to overturn it, breaking Trump on newly declassified GOP memo,
[12:23.120 --> 12:26.880]  alleging FBI abuses, a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves, there's no alleging,
[12:26.880 --> 12:32.880]  you have the text messages, you have the FBI agents that are now talking to Congress and
[12:33.440 --> 12:38.640]  this is just the beginning as Congressman Gates and many others said and as I told you last week
[12:38.640 --> 12:44.320]  from our sources that it's the roadmap for a public indictment, the House indicts
[12:44.320 --> 12:52.400]  in an impeachment as well, so this is a public indictment and then now it gives the president
[12:52.400 --> 12:57.840]  and others room to move against them, the Democrats know this was all political, CNN and MSNBC know
[12:57.840 --> 13:02.480]  it was all political, they know what this was all about and they are scared to death saying it's
[13:02.480 --> 13:08.720]  the end of America, it's the end of our democracy, it's the end as if the FBI and Robert Mueller are
[13:08.720 --> 13:15.200]  the government and everybody else doesn't matter and if political appointments like Robert Mueller,
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.960]  Democratic Party operatives who protected the Clinton crime machine, if they want to step in
[13:21.680 --> 13:26.480]  and use a made up dossier about Trump being urinated on and then leverage that into claim
[13:26.480 --> 13:31.360]  that there's some perjury somewhere or there's some obstruction, when they're the ones lying to
[13:31.360 --> 13:37.520]  Congress there was no leaks, come he told Congress I didn't leak, he directly then later said oh I
[13:37.520 --> 13:43.200]  gave it to a friend in the press to leak it, oh you gave it to a professor of journalism to leak it,
[13:43.200 --> 13:49.680]  it's the same, it's like saying if I hire somebody to go kill somebody and then I'm on video telling
[13:49.680 --> 13:56.000]  the person here's $10,000 now go kill this person and they go kill the person, I am just as guilty
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.640]  or more because I generated it, it's murder one, I didn't pull the trigger, you didn't pull the trigger
[14:02.640 --> 14:09.360]  but you gave the order, this is open and shut and come he's like well I told Congress that I never
[14:09.360 --> 14:17.840]  leaked because I didn't, I gave it to a journalist friend, uh-huh, you gave it to a professor friend
[14:17.840 --> 14:25.360]  of yours in the journalism school, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, did they give it to the Washington Post, oh okay
[14:25.360 --> 14:32.240]  and then McCabe got caught leaking, so they have really made some bold moves here and again this
[14:32.240 --> 14:39.280]  is Congress leveling up, this is the memo is Trump leveling up and saying we have your names on the
[14:39.280 --> 14:47.680]  three FISA court events, Gary in the campaign, the nomination right through his election when
[14:47.680 --> 14:53.760]  he's president-elect, those three warrants, when he's getting the nomination, when he's running
[14:53.760 --> 15:00.560]  against Hillary and then when he's president-elect, three different warrants to spy on everything
[15:00.560 --> 15:06.080]  in Trump land to spy and then and then they lie to the media and say they didn't and it's exactly as
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.280]  William Binney, we got to get Binney back on ASAP emergency today if we have to, just just get him
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.960]  on, please, Binney said I got a call, they like you to look at this memo, no one's given an attention
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.560]  and then the media spun it, oh Jones made it up, it's not the congressional memo and what's Binney
[15:22.560 --> 15:28.480]  know, oh I don't know, I don't know who picked up the phone and called him and said we'd like to see

[20:41.440 --> 20:50.160]  on the bombshell congressional memo that details links and a roadmap to a larger
[20:50.160 --> 20:55.520]  investigation that is now going to be launched into the confirmed political operation at the
[20:55.520 --> 21:04.080]  justice department starting in the summer of 2016 before the RNC then when he was the nominee
[21:04.080 --> 21:12.160]  and then when he was president elect for too much spying on his entire entourage the republican
[21:12.160 --> 21:19.920]  party republican members of congress yours truly and a roadmap to demonize and call everyone
[21:19.920 --> 21:26.000]  who is victorious in the american resistance against the globalist russian agents and the
[21:26.000 --> 21:32.800]  document is up on info wars.com yes the document the original document that we broke last tuesday
[21:33.440 --> 21:37.760]  that the media used the jedi mind trick and said oh well that's declassified that's not the secret
[21:37.760 --> 21:43.920]  part it's the roadmap of this memo and it's now confirmed that it is the blacked out areas that
[21:43.920 --> 21:50.640]  are being pointed out in this new memo that shows here's the key being reported by all the newspapers
[21:50.640 --> 21:59.680]  now that it shows criminal activity lying to the faiza court not once not twice but three times
[21:59.680 --> 22:03.440]  what did i say last week over and over again in every hour every day
[22:06.800 --> 22:11.840]  again faiza memo confirms surveillance of trump campaign was based on dodgy steel dossier that's
[22:11.840 --> 22:18.720]  poll's latest article but let's go back to last week's article where we published the full memo
[22:18.720 --> 22:22.480]  that the director of national intelligence had published on their website that was hiding in
[22:22.480 --> 22:29.600]  plain view that had excised portions but only about 10 wrote mapping three times that people went to
[22:29.600 --> 22:35.840]  the court and the court said we believe what you're doing is illegal so they would come back
[22:35.840 --> 22:42.080]  excluding the political nature of it and lying about their intelligence to get the warrants which
[22:42.080 --> 22:49.680]  we now know were illegal and fraudulent and political read page 19 of the 99 page memo
[22:49.680 --> 22:57.360]  this is what nunez based the proof of the perjury to congress about what the fbi democrat leadership
[22:57.360 --> 23:05.200]  did the democrat moles in the fbi that's what it is and then it expands into them lying to
[23:05.200 --> 23:14.560]  also get the three warrants exactly as we told you william benney is obviously being advised
[23:14.560 --> 23:20.160]  by not just wiki leaks but the cia he's the former technical head of the nsa he came on last week
[23:20.160 --> 23:25.360]  and for an hour laid everything out in front of you then we had congressman gates on to lay it out
[23:25.360 --> 23:29.040]  saying the roadmap is coming out that's all the citizens of the roadmap the president's gonna
[23:29.040 --> 23:34.240]  fight back we have the proof they've colluded well that's bombshell but this is just the beginning
[23:34.240 --> 23:39.280]  and it's them lying to the court three times here pull up the washington examiner it's linked on
[23:39.280 --> 23:46.320]  dredgerport.com and read what they say the main finding is that they lied to the fiza court and
[23:46.320 --> 23:52.800]  the judges now recuse themselves that they lied to the court to get the memo and and what does
[23:52.800 --> 24:00.320]  the what does the court say they say we were lied to this was illegal three times they just blacked
[24:00.320 --> 24:05.920]  out who came to them and who did it well nunez can read the blacked out parts oh but let's not
[24:05.920 --> 24:11.760]  listen to william benney former technical director of the nsa or anybody else of these congressmen
[24:11.760 --> 24:18.080]  we have on let's listen to cnn and media matters saying i hoaxed everyone and this had nothing to

[34:52.400 --> 34:56.480]  so without further ado ladies and gentlemen let's get into the memo here the constitution
[34:56.480 --> 35:00.880]  vests the president with the authority to protect national security secrets from disclosure
[35:01.840 --> 35:07.200]  as the supreme court has recognized it is the president's responsibility to classify and declassify
[35:07.200 --> 35:11.920]  and control access information bearing on our intelligence sources and methods and national
[35:11.920 --> 35:17.440]  defense and they list the us code in order to facilitate appropriate congressional oversight
[35:17.440 --> 35:22.480]  the executive branch may entrust classified information the appropriate committees of congress
[35:22.480 --> 35:28.720]  as it is done in connection with the committee's oversight activities the president's telling you
[35:28.720 --> 35:34.000]  he quartered back this from january 20th first thing he did was go in there and find out okay who
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.320]  did the unmasking the president the former president sir here's the order here's the fiza document
[35:38.320 --> 35:42.160]  heads up his place he was given three hour briefings i'm told i know some of the folks that
[35:42.160 --> 35:47.280]  were in the room and outside the room uh getting the further reports then he marched over to the
[35:47.280 --> 35:53.360]  caa then the nsa he pulled it all up looked at it all saw how they tracked him followed him
[35:53.360 --> 35:58.400]  listened to everything tried to put people on him tried to set him up with russians and then he sat
[35:58.400 --> 36:04.720]  back while they lied and let them set themselves up perjuring themselves to congress when he knew
[36:04.720 --> 36:10.240]  everything they were doing he even let mccabe and comey come in and perjure themselves to congress
[36:10.240 --> 36:15.680]  lie to him face to face he played dumb the whole time and now we can tell you what we did to you
[36:15.680 --> 36:21.280]  scum we set you up the whole time hope you enjoy yourselves part of the story that mueller was
[36:21.280 --> 36:27.040]  secretly on the president's side the the the only truth to that was is that the president was shedding
[36:27.040 --> 36:34.400]  them up the whole time fools your arrogance is what will destroy you excuse me let me just get back
[36:34.400 --> 36:39.200]  into this i'm sorry just if you know how to read this stuff see what the letter says the president
[36:39.200 --> 36:45.120]  released this the president did this the president gave it to congress the president met of course he
[36:45.120 --> 36:50.800]  did it's his authority to give the intelligence on criminal groups inside our country trying to
[36:50.800 --> 36:56.560]  overthrow our election and our republic and shut down the free press they keep asking has newness
[36:56.560 --> 37:00.320]  met with the president has newness talked about this of course he has it's what the president's
[37:00.320 --> 37:07.600]  supposed to do you are an outside threat you are enemy combatants let's continue ladies and gentlemen
[37:08.960 --> 37:13.360]  the supreme court has recognized as the president's responsibility to classify and declassify
[37:13.360 --> 37:19.200]  and control access to information bearing on our intelligence sources and methods and national
[37:19.200 --> 37:23.520]  defense see they forgot who they are in the government they're there to serve the people
[37:24.320 --> 37:28.960]  in order to facilitate appropriate congressional oversight the executive branch may interest
[37:28.960 --> 37:34.320]  classified information for the appropriate committee of congress as it is done in connection
[37:34.320 --> 37:41.120]  with the committee's oversight activities here the executive branch does so on the assumption
[37:41.120 --> 37:45.440]  that the committee will responsibly protect such classified information consistent with
[37:45.440 --> 37:50.240]  the laws of the united states the committee has now determined that the release of the memorandum
[37:50.240 --> 37:54.400]  would be appropriate the executive branch across administrations both parties has worked to
[37:54.400 --> 37:59.600]  accommodate congressional requested declassify specific materials in the public interest he
[37:59.600 --> 38:03.760]  gave the investigation to the proper body the house they investigated they said yes this is
[38:03.760 --> 38:10.560]  terrible and now boom however public released the classified information by unilateral actions
[38:10.560 --> 38:14.720]  the legislative branch is extremely rare and raises significant separation of powers concerns
[38:14.720 --> 38:19.040]  accordingly the committee's request to release the memorandum is interpreted as a request for
[38:19.040 --> 38:24.880]  declassification pursuant to the president's authority so he did it again as the president
[38:24.880 --> 38:29.920]  he initiated it he gave it to the investigative body the house that's an impeachment or any
[38:29.920 --> 38:36.240]  other matter they begin the investigation and now the indictment has been handed back to the american
[38:36.240 --> 38:44.640]  people powerful powerful gotta be ashamed of yourself as the president just said
[38:44.640 --> 38:50.480]  the committee has now determined that the release the memorandum would be appropriate the executive
[38:50.480 --> 38:55.600]  branch across administrations and it goes on under the president's authority the president
[38:55.600 --> 38:58.960]  understands that the protection of a national security represents his highest obligations
[38:58.960 --> 39:04.320]  accordingly he's directed lawyers and national security staff to assess the declassification
[39:04.320 --> 39:10.960]  request consistent with the establishment standards governing the handling of classified
[39:10.960 --> 39:17.840]  information including those under section three dot one d of executive order one three five two six
[39:17.840 --> 39:23.680]  those standards permit declassification when the public interest is disclosure outweighs any need
[39:23.680 --> 39:28.400]  to protect the information that's a repeat of the national security act basically as well the
[39:28.400 --> 39:33.280]  white house review process has included input from the office of the director of national
[39:33.280 --> 39:38.640]  intelligence uh-huh that's who originally released the actual heart of the matter the main internal
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.600]  memo the white house review process also includes input from the office of the director of national
[39:43.600 --> 39:48.240]  intelligence the department of justice consistent with the review of the standards the president
[39:48.240 --> 39:53.280]  has determined declassification the memorandum is appropriate and the same program went on
[39:53.280 --> 39:58.160]  to release this to the public the one we released last week based on this assessment and in light
[39:58.160 --> 40:01.920]  of the significant public interest in the memorandum the president has authorized the
[40:01.920 --> 40:07.200]  classification of the memorandum to be clear the memorandum reflects the judgments of his congressional
[40:07.200 --> 40:11.440]  authors the president understands that oversight concerns matters related to the memorandum may
[40:11.440 --> 40:16.240]  be continuing though the circumstances leading to the declassification through the process are
[40:16.240 --> 40:20.880]  extraordinary the executive branch stands ready to work with congress to accommodate oversight
[40:20.880 --> 40:26.160]  requests consistent with applicable standards in process including the need to protect intelligent
[40:26.160 --> 40:38.080]  sources and methods let me let me boil that down for you we got a lot more we're going to give the
[40:38.080 --> 40:43.920]  congress that that will dwarf this if the democrats and the globalists and the corrupt people at the
[40:43.920 --> 40:51.520]  top of the fbi don't roll over if you don't roll over and if you keep having this war to try to
[40:51.520 --> 40:56.080]  stop the recovery and all the rest of it we got everything on you jack just like our military
[40:56.080 --> 41:02.960]  source jack was saying they got everything all of it and if you want to play hardball let's do it
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.880]  soros and all of it just keep pushing you know one stood up to you you had a republican leadership
[41:08.880 --> 41:14.640]  that you were in bed with before you're facing opposition that now has the presidency most of
[41:14.640 --> 41:21.600]  the states and most the courts you will be defeated only a nuke attack taking out the president and
[41:21.600 --> 41:25.680]  the republican leadership like they could have done at that west virginia event with the whole
[41:25.680 --> 41:29.200]  situation i mean that they shouldn't all be in one place at one time i don't think that's smart
[41:29.200 --> 41:33.360]  unless the democrats are there as well and they still might wipe out their own people on a sacrifice
[41:33.360 --> 41:38.240]  i mean these are serious people are up against okay i mean george soros was happy to round up
[41:38.240 --> 41:43.120]  thousands of fellow jews and sent them off death camps the den the left loves him for that they
[41:43.120 --> 41:46.640]  think that's powerful they like that let's continue here
[41:50.640 --> 41:56.320]  so that is released to the speaker of the house by the president and to the honorable adam schiff
[41:56.320 --> 42:02.960]  ranking member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence so that is the letter
[42:02.960 --> 42:08.400]  from the president's lawyer explaining that trump learned of this secret information as the president
[42:08.400 --> 42:17.200]  the criminal activity he then gave it to the house intelligence committee and they have now
[42:17.200 --> 42:21.840]  handed the indictment to the public and that's why you see headlines like the white house is
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.320]  getting their intel from info wars because they're the one saying that trump was being spied on
[42:26.320 --> 42:31.680]  that was all made up we were we knew because the democrats had bragged about it during the campaign
[42:31.680 --> 42:38.400]  thinking the hillary would win so it's just amazing so here you go ladies and gentlemen when we come back

[47:36.560 --> 47:42.560]  ladies and gentlemen i'm your host alex jones thank you so much for joining us i gotta tell you
[47:42.560 --> 47:51.120]  reading the two page cover letter that the president's lawyer wrote tells you more than the memo
[47:51.120 --> 47:57.200]  itself does it's exactly what congressman gates earlier this week told us it would be
[47:59.600 --> 48:07.760]  it is it is exactly what we knew it would be it is a codified indictment of the compendium of what
[48:07.760 --> 48:13.360]  we know with the democrats organizing this fraud to stop trump from becoming president
[48:13.360 --> 48:18.560]  and then once he was elected to try to remove him from the presidency a classic conspiracy and we
[48:18.560 --> 48:23.360]  have their text messages we have witnesses we have all of it but trump's being very judicious
[48:24.560 --> 48:31.760]  as president he learned of it he then sent it to the house the intelligence they investigated
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.560]  said yes this is really horrible and now the president says well if you need more information
[48:36.560 --> 48:41.600]  we'll have to have it reviewed by the director of national intelligence and by the justice department
[48:41.600 --> 48:45.760]  we'll send that on over to you show what it really is is a giant warning we caught you
[48:45.760 --> 48:54.000]  we have you red-handed stop denying it we don't want to quote hurt the fbi we don't want to put
[48:54.000 --> 49:00.560]  you all in prison you need to stop now your fraud you've been caught you're the ones up to your
[49:00.560 --> 49:05.280]  eyeballs with the russians but just as i've told the president every time i've talked to him
[49:05.280 --> 49:10.400]  they're never gonna stop and if they make deals sir they're gonna break them and they do because
[49:10.400 --> 49:16.080]  they're so used to being in power you look at pelosi and schumer and i mean they look like
[49:16.080 --> 49:22.960]  crazy villains out of a batman movie or something i mean batman villains don't look that nutty and
[49:22.960 --> 49:27.680]  that ugly and that i mean look at schumer the way he was acting and and michael moreard i mean
[49:27.680 --> 49:33.040]  these are really a bunch of losers who know they're losers so they crave running everything
[49:33.040 --> 49:39.680]  because they're such sacks of garbage but enough of that the memo is everything we already knew
[49:39.680 --> 49:48.880]  it just lines it up and lets congress tell the public what they found and then let the establishment
[49:48.880 --> 49:54.640]  know this is a big warning to you get out of the way of america's recovery stop your lies stop your
[49:54.640 --> 50:01.120]  fraud and they can't stop they're gonna come out they're gonna attack this they're gonna lie they
[50:01.120 --> 50:05.920]  can't help it and then more is just gonna get released and miller's not gonna stop he's gonna
[50:05.920 --> 50:10.720]  have a grand jury and died a sitting president never before been done isn't even constitutional
[50:10.720 --> 50:15.760]  and they've got political articles and reuters articles every day saying well lawyers now say
[50:16.480 --> 50:23.440]  trump could be removed by a by a by a jury well then there's no separation powers if the jury
[50:23.440 --> 50:31.360]  is the house of representatives they're the grand jury the jury's the senate that's how it works or
[50:31.360 --> 50:37.520]  any town in america could get their cousins together on a jury and say the president's i mean
[50:37.520 --> 50:42.400]  travis county would have had trump indicted before he ever got an office i live in the democratic
[50:42.400 --> 50:46.720]  county that's always indicted republicans around the state and trying to put them in prison they
[50:46.720 --> 50:54.560]  always get overturned whether it's rick perry or uh tom delayed but that's what they do
[50:54.560 --> 51:02.640]  they're not all corrupt but when it comes to politics travis county's famous for it so
[51:02.640 --> 51:07.920]  that's what they're doing and and the word is now trump's being told they are planning to indict
[51:07.920 --> 51:14.320]  you for perjury and then there's no no there's not even evidence of obstruction or perjury there
[51:14.320 --> 51:19.200]  all the evidence is the democrats and the fbi agents lying to congress but lying to the phisa
[51:19.200 --> 51:24.160]  court and that's the key that's why the director of national intelligence that trump puts at the end
[51:24.160 --> 51:29.680]  of the letter released the declassified memo it was the president declassified the body
[51:30.400 --> 51:33.840]  just took the names out of who did it and that's it it's the names of them going and lying to get
[51:33.840 --> 51:39.440]  it i know i keep repeating that but you're not seeing anywhere in the media as usual what this is
[51:39.440 --> 51:44.640]  it's a threat from the president to them that we have you by the shorthairs you better back off right
[51:44.640 --> 51:52.000]  now and we've caught you in perjury in congress and to the phisa court and i keep repeating this
[51:52.000 --> 51:58.800]  because it's bombshell that trump says in the letter that that's attached to the phisa memo
[51:59.680 --> 52:02.000]  what the next game plan is he spells it out
[52:04.240 --> 52:10.800]  where the lawyers at the dnc 1000 get exactly what he's saying so here it is january 18 2018
[52:12.960 --> 52:18.880]  this is the secret memo that was finished in january two weeks ago roughly
[52:18.880 --> 52:26.160]  and they lay out the purpose the investigative update a whole roadmap and then what they found
[52:26.160 --> 52:28.960]  and i read it and it's exactly everything you've already heard here over and over again
[52:31.920 --> 52:37.600]  and they've had people testify in the doj meetings not just the documents that or
[52:37.600 --> 52:44.720]  struck all of them were desperate that donald trump not get elected and was passionate about
[52:44.720 --> 52:54.480]  him not being president and they now have this from the deputy head of the fbi who's sung like a canary
[52:58.720 --> 53:02.800]  and that's why the democrats are crapping themselves up one side and down the other
[53:03.840 --> 53:09.120]  they are in conniption fits oh who's the fbi informant
[53:09.120 --> 53:18.560]  the disgraced mccabe who just resigned a few days ago okay you may not go to prison but you're out
[53:18.560 --> 53:25.440]  of the fbi get out of here you go you ought to be ashamed of yourself and trump is signaling
[53:25.440 --> 53:30.160]  be ashamed of yourselves be ashamed of yourselves stop trying to organize killing me and all the
[53:30.160 --> 53:35.760]  rest of it and i'm telling you they can't stop you think mule was gonna stop that nut thinks
[53:35.760 --> 53:41.120]  he's the president he thinks we elected him wow this is just incredible
[53:44.240 --> 53:47.840]  let me read into the most important parts of this and then i'll come back in and get into
[53:48.480 --> 53:58.160]  more of it as well but this is simply amazing now here it is on page three
[53:58.160 --> 54:05.600]  and it gets into it just as we covered last week when we already all right here it was already
[54:05.600 --> 54:11.520]  in the actual memo they're sourcing just now we have the names before and after steel was terminated
[54:11.520 --> 54:18.320]  as a source he maintained contact with the doj via the associate deputy attorney general bruce or
[54:18.320 --> 54:23.600]  whose wife worked at fusion gps and was paid to create the dossier a senior doj official who
[54:23.600 --> 54:29.760]  worked closely with deputy attorney general yates and later rozenstein who appointed special counsel
[54:29.760 --> 54:35.840]  see rozenstein's their operative shortly after the election the fbi began interviewing or
[54:36.400 --> 54:44.240]  documenting his communications with steel for example in september 2016 steel admitted to or
[54:44.240 --> 54:49.920]  his feelings against then candidate trump when steel said was desperate that donald trump not
[54:49.920 --> 54:56.080]  get elected and was passionate about him not being president this clear evidence that's a quote
[54:56.720 --> 55:02.000]  of steel's bias was recorded by or at the time and subsequently in an official fbi files but not
[55:02.000 --> 55:10.480]  reflected in any of the page phisa applications no and then it gets into what they did say to get
[55:10.480 --> 55:17.040]  it which is a perjury to the court oh this is not political at all foreign intelligence we're looking
[55:17.040 --> 55:23.760]  at foreigners during the same period or his wife was employed by fusion gps to assist in the cultivation
[55:25.040 --> 55:30.640]  of opposition research of trump or later provided the fbi with all of his wife's opposition research
[55:30.640 --> 55:35.040]  paid for by the dnc and clinton campaign via fusion gps the or's relationship with steel and fusion
[55:35.040 --> 55:41.280]  gps was inexplicably concealed from the phisa yeah they did they gave fake reasons they did a parallel

[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.880]  stay behind network are now singing like canaries to the house intelligence committee into the
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:41.120]  president and the word is from very good sources uh it's mr mccabe who's lucky he's not going to
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.280]  get indicted the whole house of cards is imploding the man that they said front and center was the
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:55.040]  top russian agent at the heart of this just spoke to the major unions there in the uk he spoke to
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.160]  oxford now he's going to cambridge he joins us via telephone as he drives through the english
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.480]  countryside so we'll see what happens and then we'll in this segment the next read some of the
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:10.080]  real bombshell areas the memo that we haven't gotten to yet but it's exactly what roger stone said
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.120]  back in january and february of last year from his sources it's exactly and it's the president we
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.920]  now know from the cover page which is even bigger than i think than what we already knew in the memo
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.880]  that says i'm the author but basically of allowing the intel of the house i'm ready to give more intel
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.880]  to you that will destroy these people if they don't come to heal if they don't cry for quarter
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.440]  the problem is they're not going to give us quarter are they roger
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:42.720]  oh alex uh i've got to tell you in the 40 years i've been active in american politics and the
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:49.040]  10 presidential campaigns i've been through i've never seen anything like this uh and it not only
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:55.920]  is it extraordinary but but equally troubling is the fact that the president's appointees as both
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:03.360]  fbi and cia directors joined the cover-up and sought to keep this information from the american
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:11.360]  people they actually argue against the release of a memo that not only exonerates the president on
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:20.160]  the question of russian occlusion but proves that the fbi actively was involved in fabricating
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:27.360]  evidence to justify the surveillance of the republican candidate for president of the united
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.640]  state it's it's 10 000 times worse than what nixon it's criminality it's 10 000 times worse than
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:42.080]  nixon oh it watergate pales in comparison this is the the illegitimate use of the surveillance power
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.080]  and authority of the state against a major party candidate for president and now they fought no so
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:53.040]  so so they're they're fighting to obstruct now they perjure to congress they lied to the fiza
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.880]  court to get the three warrants uh they have lied to the president i mean they have committed so
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:07.600]  many crimes it's dizzying roger well we now know that they that they fabricated the underlying
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:14.240]  evidence they never told the spice court the origins of the dirty dossier that it had come
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:20.720]  not from the bureau not from our own internal investigations by our intelligence services
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:28.080]  but from a political source the president needs to fire the current fbi director mr ray
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.680]  who has fought the release of this document and as far as the last i heard was pairing a
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:39.920]  rebuttal that he was going to put out shortly after the release but that's outrageous
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.920]  that's it's absolutely outrageous he's more interested in covering up the illegal and
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:51.040]  unkind listen there are a lot of good people in the fbi why can't trump find a patriot that's
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.920]  known to be an american and now a deep state turd what is wrong with these people that they are so
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:03.200]  arrogant well you notice when he resigned last week tray gowdy a great american said he was
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:11.760]  returning to law enforcement notice he didn't say to the practice of law he said law enforcement let
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.600]  us hope and in fact that was why i tried to get a hold of you yesterday what's the word is he's
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:26.240]  gonna be joining at some type of task force trump setting up well he must be planning to go into
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:33.040]  service for the administration he did pass up the opportunity earlier to be fbi director let's be
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:39.360]  clear where mr ray came from he was heavily promoted by new jersey governor chris christy oh
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.680]  you're saying he's announcing he's not gonna run for reelection because uh he may take that fbi director
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:50.240]  job now that's what i believe but i'm keying this off the fact that he said he would be going back
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:57.440]  to law enforcement he also knows that he couldn't wait till last minute to vacate the seat stay there
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:03.040]  stay there you know i've got some talking points here about caveman from info wars life dot com
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.240]  but instead of going on those talking points let me just give you what i've experienced personally

[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:36.080]  that's that's why i think the president's got to clean out his fbi director uh was more interested
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.520]  in the cover-up of the legal activity by the agency than he was in exonerating the president and the
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:49.760]  phony russian collusion uh investigation his cia director was lockstep oh no we can't release the
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:55.280]  memo it'll expose our methods well the american people need to know what the methods are if the
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:02.880]  methods are illegal the president needs to clean house and his opportunity to do so is now you
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:12.560]  should fire fbi director ray he should fire cia director pal i'm going to tell you alex one amazing
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:18.560]  thing about being in the u k is how many info warriors there are here you have a huge following
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:26.560]  for what we are doing but the turnouts in oxford and in durham of young freedom-oriented students
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:34.080]  in these supposedly liberal baskins has really been heartening uh you would get an amazing
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:40.640]  reception here people really like what we are doing at the impetus beer i know that but we have you
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:46.480]  as a great emissary my friend i could stay here in the command bunker but uh i i would like to go
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:51.680]  out and meet a lot of the fans i get mobbed in the uk mobbed in europe even crazier in the us
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.240]  and that's not bragging it's a gauge for people out there who feel like they're alone well you're
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.800]  not a public figure well listeners and believe me there's some downsides to it so enjoy your anonymity
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:07.600]  but when you get mobbed everywhere uh and people love you it's you know you're winning and then
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:12.960]  of course every 10th person tries to pour coffee on you or assaults you uh so there's also that crazed
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:19.440]  nature have have people tried to attack you like they do in new york roger uh there's no question
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:26.240]  the libtards were out in full force last night screaming about racism and misogyny and all their
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:32.640]  identity politics be asked because that's all they have they have nothing else uh and of course
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.760]  everybody wants to ask me the most important question do you really know paul joseph wants it
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.600]  yeah he's a rock star and doesn't know it and that's the thing is you're really a libertarian
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.960]  republican you're fiscally conservative pro america but i mean you go to the gay rights parades
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:54.640]  you've been for him legalization for 30 years uh i mean you're a pretty socially liberal guy
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.720]  and when they come and try to stop your events calling you a nazi and all this stuff it's just
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:06.800]  asinine bs well you know look i'm anti-war i think we ought to be out of afghanistan out of syria
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:12.800]  but my real concern is about the erosion of our civil liberties uh and this scandal is all about
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:19.600]  that look they gotta face a court warrant to spy on yours truly and they lied to do it they have
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:25.360]  violated my civil rights at the same time they were spying on paul maniforte carter page and
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:31.120]  donald jay trump and the media spends it goes right and the media spends it goes who cares about
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:37.440]  carter page each warrant allows them to spy on millions in a giant dragnet and target everybody
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:44.000]  including myself and they admit i've been in those phone calls and there's no no collusion
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:51.920]  there's nothing they know that roger well why the guardian yesterday said that the bbc should
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.640]  not interview roger stone you see they like censorship they can't win in the battlefield of
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.960]  ideas they can't win an honest debate so they just want to silence us that's why yesterday i
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:09.280]  punked the british media by going by the tiny cramped ecuadorian embassy where julien assange
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:16.640]  who is not a russian asset who is a valiant honest journalist uh is you know they basically
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:23.840]  being held a political prisoner amazing so what do you expect to happen now i mean do you agree
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.360]  with me that it's the cover letter it's what's most important we already knew all the stuff in
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.480]  here it just shows trump tells him i got a lot more i created the investigation the house found
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.720]  that well you know that this was going on uh and i'm ready to come after you more i mean i don't see
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:44.800]  how they recover from this well watch the fbi carefully uh because i think that that they will
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:51.440]  launch a counterattack they're going to try to discredit the nunez memo also watch shifty adam
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:58.240]  shift uh this guy has got to be desperate now because the fact that he's been working overtime
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:05.040]  to cover up sedition to cover up this treasonous activity uh you know this man has no tape so he
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:11.120]  will attempt to rewrite history i battled with the bbc all day today saying you're undermining
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.800]  the authority of law enforcement you're you're helping glademire putin no i'm not i want the
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.520]  law enforcement agencies in the united states to operate within the parameters of u.s constitution
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.440]  everybody knows that third world nations and every other empire falls when the law enforcement
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:33.520]  becomes corrupt and becomes political it's over you're going back to julia cesar 2050 something
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:38.960]  years ago so it's the same story over and over again they know that everybody knows third world
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.400]  countries they have corrupt police and scuffs that's why they can't get their act together
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:48.560]  and and they're not bringing banana boat republic garbage here and they've been caught red-handed
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:54.240]  but it's it's not just like they knew as stroke says in the in the text messages there's no proof
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.880]  oh my god we're in trouble there's no russian collusion but we can't let him get into office
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:05.040]  it's worse than that roger because then hillary is up her eyeballs in real russian collusion
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:12.960]  well the other thing we know is that the president's de facto attorney general
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:19.760]  rod rozenstein has known all of this the entire time he should also be discharged now interestingly
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:26.720]  alex he very quietly through ranks previous then the white house chief of staff got the president
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:33.520]  to sign a document that changed the line of authority at the justice department so all
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:38.480]  decisions go first to the attorney general then the first deputy but then instead of going to
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:44.320]  solicitor general they go to the second deputy a bush deep stater then they go to the u.s attorney
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:51.120]  in texas another deep stater and then they go to the u.s attorney in north carolina how curious
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:59.120]  this was their insurance policy so that Mueller and rozenstein could never be discharged that's right
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.040]  they go oh my gosh he got in we've already been illegally spied we got to cover this up okay
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.080]  hire a special counsel rozenstein already been quarterbacking this with mccabe with coming
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:11.920]  oh mr president you know we have to do this they do it on their own authority they change
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:18.640]  the power structure uh to then routed around internal affairs the the inspector general
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:24.480]  they turn off internal affairs that right there's the headline rozenstein turned off justice department
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:31.280]  internal affairs to carry out unethical uh operations i mean they but he's it's the president's
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.440]  duty to fire them now even if it looks like he's doing it to stop him investigating him because
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:42.640]  they're a bunch of crooks he's absolutely essential that he fired the fbi director in the
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:48.880]  de facto attorney general mr rozenstein immediately they are up to their need in this
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:53.200]  and let's explain that folks we break the law if the president doesn't do that let's do one more
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.040]  segment roger we have to they committed crimes they've been caught you can't keep them there

[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:53.840]  kingdom by storm i think we've already passed our darkest hour at least in the current fights
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:59.440]  with the globalists but there are great fights coming up as well the eternal vigilance is needed
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:05.040]  roger you've been dropping some big bombshells on me uh while we were talking as you've been
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.680]  talking to your sources and others so what does the president have to worry about now
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:17.600]  where are we at the juncture with this memo uh and how how do the democrats grab victory from the
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:24.000]  jaws of their defeat how do we how do we make sure that we don't smoke the same pipe of arrogance
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.520]  that they've smoked let's let's look at the the danger factors right now in this epic
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:39.200]  sea in which we swim well well remember alex we still have the uh the establishments hit man
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:46.400]  robert miller the special council out there and uh he has sent two strong signals this week
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:53.360]  i still believe as i predicted here sometime ago that the indictment of the president's son-in-law
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:22:00.400]  on some completely phony clumped up non-russian related charge is imminent and i literally just
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.760]  got a text message from a social press reporter who wants to know whether i think hope you're
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:11.680]  sitting down whether hope picks the president's communications director was working for the russians
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:18.800]  i kid you not which is the most absurd ridiculous thing i've oh oh oh while you've been in england
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:25.040]  they're all over tv saying nunez is a russian agent i mean it's it's like saying he's a purple
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:32.080]  dragon from pop tart land uh from candyland i mean it's entered and you know we laugh at this
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.280]  i laughed at it and said stop being so upset a few years ago they were saying about you
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:40.160]  then when they said about me and start cutting our websites off and banning us because i'm a russian
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:46.400]  agent man it's like it makes you want to punch somebody in the nose well you got john mccain
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:52.880]  out only only minutes ago saying the only person benefiting from the release of this memo is latimer
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:59.120]  boogie this guy is literally demented at this point no senator the people who are benefiting from
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:04.400]  this memo are the american people because the corruption of our intelligence agencies has been
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:11.520]  laid bare for everybody to see so that the president can clean house fire rosenstein fire director ray
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:16.480]  think about that they've been caught in their own text messages and admissions
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:22.480]  making up russia yate to overturn an elected president they're the foreign globalist multinational
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.720]  power we're exposing their foreign power that's what these democrats are they admit it they want
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.600]  to get rid of the country it's borders everything we expose that they go oh no no america first you're
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:37.360]  really russians and then try to block the recovery it's so ridiculous and now if we don't let them
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:43.440]  uh impeach trump are indicting and removing we're russian agents just do whatever we say
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:48.080]  or you're russian agents and rand paul you're a russian agent tucker carlson you're a russian
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:53.920]  agent alex jones you're a russian agent devon unez chairman unez you're a russian agent and it's
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:59.360]  like it's ridiculous until you have a foaming group of democrats come up they all look like they're
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:03.520]  half dead and had lobotomies they all look like they've escaped from a lunatic asylum and it's
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.920]  scary that they've got this many brain damaged people that actually think we're russian agents
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:14.400]  roger well it's kind of like night of a living dead it really is quite extraordinary uh look
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:21.440]  to see how micrarchism it's degenerated to name calling because they have to impune your integrity
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:26.800]  and your patriotism because they have nothing else they have no positive program to run on
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:32.960]  presidents running on prosperity and job creation turning this country around two million new jobs
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:38.240]  in the year he's been elected president i want to say this i mean i mean if latimer putin was
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:45.680]  behind this which again is completely absurd wow putin's making america great again i mean it's
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:51.680]  it's absurd for them of course as we know latimer putin was for hillary clinton why else would he
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:59.440]  pay john pedesta 38 million dollars through one of his oligarch banking buddies why else did he do
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.600]  the was he paying them to get control of american uranium yeah i wonder away with the plinons i wonder
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:10.400]  why trump is ordering heavy weapons shipped to ukraine and surrounding russia with troops
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:17.280]  under putin's orders i guess yeah i mean that right there proves the entire nonsense that he
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:24.000]  kills to the russians but he has no illusions uh but his real fundamental sin what the eyes of
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.360]  the goblas is he would not expand the proxy war in syria that's what this is really about
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:35.280]  illy promise to the war don't worry but let's be honest let's be honest letting sessions run around
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:42.000]  trying to put pot smokers in prison uh is is horrible but that pales compared to being being
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:48.080]  bullied into by the neocons that are in his in his office thanks to bannon into encircling russia
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.720]  when russia is our friend now more and more and has been helping us defeat radical islam
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:58.000]  and and when russia is full of resources and and and trump's instinct is to work with russia
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:04.960]  and and and so that's really trump's only big failure well look i think he is i think he's
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:10.320]  worried he has no illusions about the corruption of the soviet system out of the old soviet system
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:17.360]  and he has no illusions about booting being a good guy but alex they have thermonuclear weapons
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:23.120]  always better to talk to people who can destroy you than to try to go to war with them which is
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:29.920]  the collision course we were on in syria a no-fly zone in syria pushed by john mccain backed by
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:36.240]  hilly clinton was an engraved invitation for world war three sure in closing you said off air you
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.320]  said they're really going to push trump well i mean repeat what you said just just in 60 seconds
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:45.760]  that they're going to push uh trump to uh you know not damage and destabilize the country back off
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:52.160]  so this story goes away so that miller can indict him that's it i think that they're going to try
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:58.560]  to talk him out of cleaning house it's essential that he clean the house now rosenstein has got
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:04.240]  to go as i wrote for him from words two weeks ago he should fire rosenstein then he should order
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:11.040]  rep sessions to appoint special counsel in the matter of uranium one that is an investigation
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:18.560]  of what entail miller combi mccabe and rosenstein himself who was the desk officer in that cover

[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:41.680]  and william benney joins us a former technical head of the national security agency uh and
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:46.560]  he headed up the technical operations of that agency is the source of course uh and the main
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:52.240]  technical advisor for the film snowden and a good american and so many other documentaries and
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.520]  films and books that are detailing that and he pointed out when he was on with us last tuesday
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.880]  that it had gotten no attention that a source had pointed out to him that there was a 99 page
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:10.080]  memo uh report put out by the fiza court that they had been approached three times to do things
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:14.560]  that they thought were unethical and they had sent the justice department fbi back before they
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:20.960]  granted those we now know the blacked out areas just as mr benny said are the president being
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:27.840]  targeted and so you have them that's what's in the new memo that the uh president are now released
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:39.120]  of the congress today that they lied to get the memos they lied to get the uh the uh fiza court
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:44.480]  thing three times the warrants then they lied to congress about what they did then they leaked
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:52.400]  and lied about it uh and now you've got the entire fbi apparatus at the top along with rosenstein
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:57.760]  the justice department and or and all of them an incredibly arrogant incestuous conspiracy that
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:03.280]  their own tech show that they have committed so it's amazing and i was talking to mr benny during
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.400]  the break and he was blown away that almost no media picked it up last week when we pointed out
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:19.600]  that this fiza investigation is uses the blueprint to back up what the president has been saying and
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:25.680]  what the memo itself says is put out by newness but enough of my breakdown of that william benning
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:31.680]  joins us uh to go over this with us right now but again there's the amazing cover sheet by the
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:38.000]  white house uh lawyer for the president saying we're ready to release more and to work with
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.080]  congress to expose the full extent this is just the beginning so uh mr benny you had said last
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:50.160]  tuesday you hope this was just the beginning uh and you've been told that this uh larger memo uh
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:55.840]  investigation by the fiza court was one of the prime areas tying in and at a nexus point of a
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:02.240]  third party the judicial branch uh now documenting what the executive and the legislative have found
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:08.640]  yep yeah that's right uh and uh i think the more and more they go into it they're gonna find that
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:15.360]  uh nsa is involved in this and that they need to look at what which names of people uh were
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.600]  unmasked uh through the nsa and which ones were targeted through their collection system
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:25.600]  and uh what what data uh they were using internally in the fbi and how they were using that data
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.800]  that's really uh where criminality comes in where you use these agencies against the innocent or
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:38.400]  against us citizens with no probable cause that's a direct violation of the fourth amendment
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.840]  and they shouldn't have been doing that anyway they know that that's why they're trying to keep
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:51.600]  everything so secret there's so many angles to this but just in general where do you want to start
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:58.160]  as a true expert uh on looking at what historically is unfolding the debate it's causing i mean if we
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:04.000]  thought snowden and drake and benny uh you know triggered so much of this in wikileaks honorable
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.960]  people now what point in history have we reached i mean this is really exposing the deep state
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.960]  yes it is and uh it's like uh the first place i'd start is to go after this sworn affidavit that
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:20.720]  the fbi had to submit to the visa court to get that warrant that that of course uh according to the
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:26.160]  memo seemed to focus on that dossier the steel dossier and uh and that that was a false basis
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:31.920]  to begin with and they knew that and they they didn't even talk about the dnc paying to have that done
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.320]  so this is paid propaganda used to get a warrant and the visa court to go after other people in
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:42.320]  another campaign then and then that means you have to go into the and into the uh unmasking by the
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:46.640]  white house of people who were in the trump campaign find out who they were targeting and what day
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.680]  they were getting it how they were using it this is really a mess i mean it gets into the total
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:38:00.960]  subversion and sedition basically and treason against this country and what's amazing is those
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:06.240]  are true words that's not hyperbole as i look at the unclassified memo here in front of me william
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:14.400]  benney and i think about the arrogance and the hubris of trying something like this and thinking
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:20.400]  that you would have the justice department the fbi the democratic party uh hillary clinton all of them
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:27.520]  admittedly fingerprints on it paying for it and then sending it to the justice department fbi when
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:31.760]  they're the ones that originally paid to have it created and then going in before the court and
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:37.040]  perjuring yourself and not saying this is political this was written by the dnc this was paid to be
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:42.480]  made up as fake opposition research for those that don't know about the law even if prestigious
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:47.120]  lawyers or companies or groups want to have something say in a supreme court case they's
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.440]  called an ambicus brief they have to state who they are and then put their argument in because
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:56.080]  all the facts of evidence have to have their providence and their chain and have to be accepted
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:01.360]  in but to use the signant of the justice department and the president who we now that's
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.360]  going to come out next by the way we know that front hasn't released it yet that the president
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.840]  would order fake garbage put in and use that gravitas with the executive running into the
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:15.680]  judicial like that this is an incredible constitutional crisis yeah and and it's by
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:20.720]  the way uh this is not the first time that the fbi has gotten involved in uh lying to the supreme
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.920]  court or falsifying evidence for the i mean not the supreme court but the visor court to get warrants
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:33.200]  uh back in two nineteen uh in 2002 it was in august i think it came out of the news that the
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:39.440]  visor court had had found out and discovered that the fbi had misrepresented facts in up to 75
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.720]  warrants that they submitted into the court to get approval so i mean it's not new this is
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:49.520]  something the visor court should already know and and know that those procedures are really a
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:55.280]  hazard and a danger for them to be able to see through and stop i you know it's it's just a
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:00.400]  total corruption of our justice system to allow this to continue well that's my point is that i
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.160]  understand if trump doesn't want to look like he's guilty and then does it fire uh all these other
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:13.360]  people like ray and and rosa's team but law says he has to he's the executive they've been caught he
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.920]  he has to fire them all hell they ought to all get swat teamed right i mean you know you got swat
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:24.800]  team for secretly testifying to congress totally legally about all this stuff that's right and uh
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.120]  they falsified evidence in my case too and i caught them at it except like i couldn't afford
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.400]  to go after them i'm not couldn't get anybody represent me pro bono or other people were with
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:39.440]  me like herk webe and others we all wanted we all and ed lumas we all went to the rutherford
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:43.440]  institute and i said yeah you know they did violate your constitutional rights but it's really
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:48.080]  going to be a long fight and you know we couldn't afford to do that and we couldn't get a we couldn't
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:53.280]  get a lawyer to represent us pro bono so we didn't pursue it so but they did the same thing here
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:59.280]  and this is simply a continuation this is a very bad uh pattern of behavior by the fbi
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:05.040]  and the doj together you know i watch mainstream tv and they're hysterically lying about everything
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:10.000]  but we're here covering the facts and you're totally vindicated last week pointing out
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.560]  that hey i'm told by sources this is part of the big investigation this is the memo
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:18.320]  that they're going to source connecting where they lied and sure enough they mentioned the
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:24.400]  fiasa court and the uh points that are in this memo uh at the times they went to get three different
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:28.320]  warrants based on lies so you have been absolutely vindicated as the person
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:32.640]  that pointed this out when it was hiding in plain view and and i know you're not about credit
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:37.040]  it's just that george soros publications came out and said that you and i were basically liars
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.520]  and this this had nothing to do with it but you've been totally completely vindicated well i would
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:47.120]  also say alex that uh that uh it's really sad state that you're you and your program's the only
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:53.040]  one being a talking about this uh fiasa court ruling and all that so i mean who who where's
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:58.000]  what's the mainstream media their their job under the first amendment is to inform the the the
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:02.800]  people of the country what their government is doing on their behalf and they're supposed to be
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:07.200]  investigating and here they're abrogating that job they're not doing it at all so you know we
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:10.800]  should take them out of the first amendment they don't belong there anymore they're no longer useful
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:15.600]  in that area well and here you are the former technical head of the nsa super respected is
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:19.920]  i mean like platinum standard everybody admits that even even liberals have to admit it and you're
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:24.960]  saying hey this is really key this is a big part of it they just totally disregard and only a few
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:30.400]  articles saying you know we're wrong it's the wrong memo no we know it's not newness is memo
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:35.920]  but it's what he sources and is actually even more important when you get into the totality of it
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:40.960]  the security agencies though have declassified it but lower level than mid-level they've asked

[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:06.800]  controversial fiza memo the news comes after the fbi issued a rare public statement saying it had
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:12.080]  grave concerns about its release which could be detrimental to national security fbi director
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:16.960]  christopher ray is reportedly pressuring the white house to redact all names in the memo prior to
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:22.640]  its release so much for transparency congressman jeff duncan says the release of the fiza memo will
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:28.240]  shake the fbi to its core he revealed that the document exposes how the agency was weaponized
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:33.760]  by hillary clinton and the obama administration to spy on the trump campaign representative adam
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:38.400]  schiff has tried to block the release of the damning fiza memo saying he discovered material
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.600]  changes to it chairman nunez's office said the changes were minor and blasted the complaint
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:49.040]  as a bizarre distraction from the abuses detailed in the memo and the soon to be released fiza memo
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:54.800]  has been a trending topic for days because the deep state tried so hard to suppress it lian macadoo

[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:23.040]  worldwide trying to drain the swamp incredible discussions during the breaks with dr william
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:27.360]  benny former technical director of the national security agency and we were talking about
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.760]  draining the swamp we're talking about the arrogance of these people we were talking
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:38.480]  about where the fight goes on uh from here does this really harm us intel we're going to get into
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:44.320]  it all right now with william benny with the release of the devastating congressional
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:52.960]  faiza breakdown memo looking at how they lied to go to court uh and and get these search warrants
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:58.640]  true perjury true crimes then lied to congress about it uh i don't think the president has
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.480]  any choice he's got to move but mr benny if you just repeat your own words the powerful things
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:08.800]  you were saying during the break uh about the arrogance but also uh the arrogance is only
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:13.360]  matched by trump's courage i mean we have to say it in the last hundred years i've not even read
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:19.200]  about or even another country something like this uh trump going up against this entrenched state
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:25.680]  when he could have rolled over to them this is your own words about this place well and like
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:30.480]  we were discussing i just see this as the as a crack a little small opening that's coming now
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:35.680]  where we're going to be able to see into all the criminality and corruption and and simply
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:43.680]  money laundering and bribery and all that stuff behind the the swamp and the and the secret
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:48.800]  government that's involved here i mean what we're talking about is uh president trump having the
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.760]  courage to stand up and start addressing the intelligence community and the power they've
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:58.960]  been using like they are jade grover on supersteroids having knowledge and leverage on everyone
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:05.680]  and using it and so i see this as uh as having seeing for the president is having the courage to
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.720]  stand up and start cleaning the swamp and this is like core to that swamp once you start breaking
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:16.960]  this up then the rest of it should fall fairly quickly and that's what he says in the cover
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:21.840]  letter page and a half they say we've got a lot more we're ready to work with congress to bring
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:26.400]  it out uh because this deals with our national security and this is our national security break
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:34.000]  away rogue groups with a trillion dollar spy machine beyond the manhattan project playing god
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.080]  trying to convert us to a high tech manhara republic yeah that's exactly right i mean
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:44.240]  if you allow this thing to go on and don't correct the intelligence process and the
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:49.440]  intelligence agencies you can do and can keep repeating things like weapons of mass destruction
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:53.840]  we'll go kill a couple hundred thousand people or a gulf of tonkin affair that didn't happen
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:58.400]  and we'll go kill a couple million people or you can you know you can destabilize the middle east
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:04.000]  you can do all kinds of things that are simply wrong unfounded unsubstantiated and just uh
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:12.160]  non-moral or anything else i mean this is just crazy we have to clean this up he's got to do that
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.720]  he seems quite willing to do that and i'm going to be i would be there cheering him on and supporting
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.120]  him any way i could well we know you've been advising him through ci director pompeo and
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:26.400]  what you just said was so profound i got chills because gulf of tonkin killed a couple million
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:32.960]  vietnamese on both sides killed you know 58 000 us hundreds of thousands horribly maimed millions
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:38.960]  you know others uh you just totally psychologically shot that was all based on a lie and we have the
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:42.320]  recordings of mac namara and the rest of it from the white house where they fixed the intelligence
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:47.280]  and made that up and then you've got things that took us to war this office of special plans
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:50.400]  inside the pentagon because they couldn't get the regular pentagon people to lie so they created
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:57.840]  a special office now it's just a dossier in england made up ridiculous like a comic book
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:01.760]  and then they're not just starting a war with some foreign country you know that's bad enough
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:09.280]  it's against a sitting elected president i mean they it shows it's really a false flag it shows
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:14.160]  how this whole false flag blames the russians but the targets the american people and the american
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:19.200]  recovery and it just as you said it just escalates the hubris can you repeat what you said during
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:24.880]  the break about their hubris well they are so arrogant that they've got they think they've
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:29.600]  got so much power and control over everything that they feel they're just above the law and they
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:32.880]  could do anything they want they can lie to congress out in the open and there are no
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:36.800]  consequences they can lie to the president or anybody else and there are no consequences
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:41.920]  because they feel they've got all this knowledge and power over everyone so they're just above
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:46.720]  everything they're they are the know-it-all and we have to all follow them and we'll follow them
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:51.920]  into these wars and things like that and the only people who suffer are our poor we pour people
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:58.320]  down at the bottom of the pyramid you know they make the decisions and we suffer wow and
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.520]  now it's starting to turn around a little bit and they're panicking and they're arrogant
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:11.360]  and but it is a new super class imagine where they can spy on the republican nominees spy on the
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:16.560]  the president-elect arrogantly the day before he was sworn in saying we got seven ways to sunday
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:22.080]  to get you we're gonna remove you uh uh brennan said you ought to watch your mouth and then was
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:26.560]  shocked when trump fired him three days later the day before the president sworn in you better
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:32.960]  watch your mouth i mean that is that is like lunatic asylum arrogance but it's the arrogance of
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:37.680]  these people that's that's the way they feel they are the ones who are at the real power that's their
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:43.120]  position you know you don't brag about yourself i know you received a lot of secret awards basically
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:47.360]  were the equivalent of multi-star officer you're heading up the nsa but your credit is being the
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:51.680]  top code breaker ever in the nsa's history at helping bring down the soviet union so many other
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:57.840]  things uh did did did you're amazing real power and ongoing when you left the nsa to expose all
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:02.560]  this what in 2000 did that make you feel more humble the more power you got or or more powerful
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:07.520]  because in my experience as i get more powerful i feel more humble and actually scared about it
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:11.280]  because i know i'm fallible and have issues even though i want to be a good person but i
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:15.600]  know people in my life that are like managers at restaurants who are these uh these primadonna
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:21.680]  crazy people a little bit of power they go nuts yeah it kind of puts you in a position of realizing
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:27.280]  these responsibility you have to whatever you say and make sure and make sure that what you do say
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:34.400]  is true and and uh can be validated and verified or at least checked and and and you stand up for
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:40.720]  it and yet you have to do the best you can to make sure you're only being honest with everybody
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:45.600]  as best you can that's all and that that every the more influence you get the more responsibility
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:52.640]  is to make sure that's true going back to 2000 when you're secretly testifying to congress with
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:57.120]  others about all the illegal stuff that was starting up in 2001 could you though imagine
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:03.520]  how this would happen and now wiki leaks and trump and i mean i don't see long term how this
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:10.080]  corrupt superclass stays in place when what they're doing is show show discriminatory against
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:13.840]  99.9 percent of us you know they they try to make blacks and whites fight all this other
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:18.880]  men and women but the truth is we have a breakaway super state technocracy that thinks it's god
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.200]  that's that's basically that's basically the problem yeah we have to we have to remind them
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:30.480]  very very clearly and we have to look back we have to look back and go after these people
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:34.800]  and hold them accountable because we don't what that means is other people coming into
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:39.120]  those positions will be corrupted by that power too and say well look what they did i'll do that
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:44.800]  too that's why i blame uh what's going on now a lot on jerry ford for pardoning nixon he was
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.760]  being indicted for what he did on a much smaller scale it's the same that they're doing today but
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:54.560]  it was a much smaller scale breaking into a psychiatrist office and having a list of 105
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:58.720]  people that he wanted to be audited i mean we obama had it done to tens of thousands with
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:07.200]  exactly it's of the scale is a microscopic yeah and nixon was impeached and then indicted for that
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:13.680]  but there jerry ford pardoned him that took away the the accountability for the president
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:17.760]  that said the president really has to get out of jail free card it's the next president
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:25.120]  wow wow i want to just point out folks that we sell the film he's not even paid for doing it
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:32.960]  but he's in it he should be he's done a great job mr benny has obviously a film like snowden
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:38.320]  that he advised on that was amazing but also a good american dot or you can find the dvd there
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:44.640]  we sell it in four store dot com pg uh knowledge dot e u is a plan to have these systems that are
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:49.920]  ethical and don't give individuals power over others but actually targets real criminal threats
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:54.320]  and real criminal operations once those tracking and nexus points have been proven and then that
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.680]  comes out of the algorithm in the program you can talk about that a little bit more in the next
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:02.880]  segment so find out about that and expose facts dot org we'll come back to mr benny and i agree with
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:09.120]  him i don't feel worthy to even be at this platform level with somebody like him and so many others
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:14.560]  breaking so much of this but it's it's it's that a little radio show out of texas grew into this
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:19.280]  because other people won't do it if they say necessity is the mother of invention
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:25.680]  and that's what it is they won't do their job so it's alex jones doing it and it's the listeners
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:30.400]  then funding us to build organically the platform to get this out to millions of people because
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:35.680]  they wouldn't do it they just took what they were told set it by the government corporations
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:40.160]  as a bunch of yes men and women and got us in this position so i again i go back to the listeners
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:43.760]  and the heroes like william benning he hasn't already called that but he is he went through a lie
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:47.200]  and a lot of other stuff that i know is off the record he probably don't want to get into
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:51.200]  he's he's a manly guy everything but they they really you know they pull the stops out i can tell
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:57.440]  you and uh so this is a real war we need your financial support as well we just sell the very
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:02.560]  best vitamins and minerals like our turmeric it's 400 plus milligrams the strongest 95 per cent
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:07.680]  curcumin and we other stuff tested it holds just like three percent it's a joke because they just

[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:12.960]  powerful i don't know what you call the last 30 minutes i mean the memos out i'll cover that more
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:18.160]  in the next segment it's an exact blueprint and and sources the document that benney brought up
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:22.480]  last week that no one had covered and you know the tree falls in the forest it doesn't make a sound
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:27.360]  i mean if nobody's there didn't make a sound yeah that that had been out from the office of the
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:32.080]  director of national intelligence no one was pointing it out benny did and the media just went oh
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:37.120]  that's already been out but no one covered it you won't cover it it's now the source of much of
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:42.160]  what's in the new nas memo don't you feel stupid so mr benning in the four and a half minutes we have
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:46.960]  left uh i've been asking a lot of questions here but uh one point you wanted to make during the
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:51.840]  break we were talking was this live this is hurting the us or hurting intelligence agencies are
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:56.480]  giving out methods i i'm not an expert like you but i read the memo there there's nothing there but
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:02.480]  a bunch of democrat operatives lying to get fake warrants yeah it's uh what they're doing is they're
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:07.760]  trying to use national security issues as a way of covering up for their embarrassments to people
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:12.560]  or the crimes that people are committing and i would also point out that there really wasn't
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:19.600]  any need to to have the president declassify that under executive order 13526 section 1.7 which
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:26.480]  governs all the classification of documents in the u.s government they are required to uh they
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:33.440]  cannot they cannot classify and maintain classified or not declassify any documents that contain
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:41.120]  information on about criminal activity or uh or embarrassment uh or corruption or fraud or waste
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:47.040]  they cannot use that classification to cover that so in other words any any evidence that they have
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:54.720]  a criminal activity must be declassified by their own actions and trump's following that he says
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:59.120]  national security's been violated we have evidence of criminal activity it is my duty to give this to
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:02.720]  the house they have found as i have found and i'm ready to get more information to the committee
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:07.680]  that has got to make the globalists and these corrupt networks crap their pants and it would
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:13.440]  because they've been so criminal i mean they have been doing this against it basically the entire
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:19.280]  population of the united states and the world uh for since 2001 they've been doing this and and
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:22.880]  they've been using it in court of law and perjuring themselves to convict people and
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:28.640]  and thousands of people are in jail because of this program so you know they have a lot to account for
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:35.280]  i would be ashamed spying on my wife or people if i had these systems i would be
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:39.760]  you know there's just no honor and i guess they're trying to recruit people that don't have honor
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:44.400]  and then the good guys i'm told it kept low level and then the bad people just get put at the top
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:50.560]  until you get people like hayden and clapper and brennan you know uh before congress saying we've
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:58.000]  never spied on one american it's just it's unbelievable well what they meant was we we've
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:04.320]  never we've we haven't spied on any we have not spied on just one american we've spied on them all
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:09.280]  that's what it is and and they they they they're so arrogant they don't care what they say they
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.600]  can lie to anybody or say anything they want to and they don't think there's any consequence
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:18.400]  this is why we have to look back this is why we have to address these issues with those people
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:24.480]  and hold them accountable for what they did well i think we've come a long way we've had a long way
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:29.680]  to go but uh they say the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step i think we've
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:33.200]  gone about a hundred miles in a thousand miles and we're committed we're going down the road i think
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:37.280]  we're gaining speed i think a lot of positive stuff's happening do you agree with that a and then
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:41.040]  being closing how does the deep state strike back though because you were saying during the break
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:47.840]  the fb is kind of the scapegoat here you're saying the nsa's behind it yeah i uh actually uh i think
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:52.800]  we have a lot more that go than a than a thousand miles but i think we're in that this is the break
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:58.240]  and i think this break now is opening up the real rottenness in our in our government in washington
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:04.560]  and in the agencies that that make it up and so this is where this is where we really have to get
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:09.520]  to it and it goes beyond like the fbis the front they take the flag from everybody because they
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:14.720]  figure they'll still survive because we need the fbis but behind them are the supporting agencies
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:20.720]  like nsa and and cia and others who are actually helping them do and achieve what they want to
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:27.200]  do as a collective uh group of that i call them the uh pretorian guard who will determine what
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:31.680]  our government does and so that's why that's why they think they have so much power now we have
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:37.520]  to shine the light on and and show them out for what they've been doing and hold those people who
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:44.000]  did it in those agencies accountable and make sure we we carry through all the law and apply all the
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:50.800]  law equally to all of them so trump has to fire these people i think so all right william benning
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:57.600]  thank you so much powerful information thank you so much sir we'll be right back climb to the top
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:04.720]  of the food chain with alpha power by info wars life for those who want to increase testosterone

[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:23.680]  broadcasting worldwide from the info wars dot com studios
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:36.880]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen to this historic groundhog day february second 2018
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:45.440]  i gotta tell you that last 30 something minutes of william benning was just unbelievable i mean
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:51.600]  this is history happening we really are the good guys we really are turning the country around
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:57.520]  we really are standing up against globalism and the poison of its anti-family transhumanist agenda
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:08.000]  the telecoms the big internet companies have already told trump they're gonna stop censoring
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:12.480]  but they haven't quit so he's gonna start breaking them up next
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:21.440]  and then comey comes out he's gonna be teaching ethics what a joke when he leaked stuff to the
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:26.960]  media a lot about the congress was involved in this conspiracy he's come out and made all these
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:33.360]  sickening statements he says that's it dishonest's misleading memo wrecked the house intel committee
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:36.800]  destroyed trust the intelligence community damaged relationship with fires the court
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:42.160]  and inexcusably exposed classified information of an american citizen for what doj and fbi
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:48.320]  must keep doing their jobs which means stay behind networks that matter we're all caught memos and
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:52.880]  documents and emails and text messages admitting there's no russian collusion and we gotta have
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:08:04.800]  an insurance policy and keep trump out and on and on and on comey arrogant maybe acromegaly or
[02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:09.040]  whatever causes you to have brain problems they say it starts cutting into your brain stem i mean
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:13.680]  maybe something's going on with him i feel sorry for his acromegaly but other than that he's still
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:18.480]  a person and a bad guy at eight feet tall or whatever it is i guess they made him the director
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:23.280]  to like scare people when you're like toddling and hardly walking it's kind of sad the guy's
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:28.000]  bigger than andre the giant i mean i got he's a freak of political evil not because of his
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:47.760]  acromegaly but because of his arrogance we now know from the fiza document you know it hurt me last
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:59.360]  week when not the mainstream media but even some of the liberty-based media said oh jones just wanted
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:06.000]  to get a cheap shot in and said that he'd released the secret fiza memo when we said here's the secret
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:11.840]  fiza memo declassified there's 10 of it or so i haven't added it all up it's blacked out but
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:17.360]  this is the illegal spying and they say they were asked to illegally spy and they block out who it was
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:24.960]  against and by who but the word is this is new naz's memo new naz is going to use this as the
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:29.680]  roadmap to prove that they did it politically and didn't admit it was political and didn't
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:34.480]  admit it had been funded by the democratic party which is a big big deal it's perjury
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.600]  and it hurt me that even though william benney came on and even though that was happening that
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:49.360]  the media spun it that i said this was the new naz memo which is called the secret fiza memo
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:56.560]  talking about the the crimes they had to give new naz's memo a name and the heart of it is the fiza
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:03.280]  testimony and fiza putting a report out to the president april 20 60 17 he'd only been in a
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:07.840]  couple months and they're like sir this is highly classified this is what they did to you
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:15.120]  you he wanted a report he asked for a report the the fiza court gave him a report and said there's
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:19.680]  three instances where they lied to us to get these warrants on you mr president
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:26.800]  and then the names of who they were surveilling and then who asked for the surveillance is blacked out
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:28.640]  but this is it
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:36.880]  no coverage other than media matters and then a few of the other publications that
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:43.600]  parrot their their bs towards soros bs saying jones tried to hoax his audience when i'm not going to
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:51.040]  get into behind the scene stuff but benny was specifically contacted and hey we see you're on
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:56.720]  jones's show no one's covered this this is part of the memo this is this is the this is the rosetta
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:02.000]  stone this is what you want to look at that was a few hours where benny was on he said hey i haven't
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.760]  read it all but yeah it's three instances of illegally doing it blah blah blah you had the
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:12.400]  former head of the ns said that was all about that court telling you what was key but what does he know
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:20.160]  he's just a valiant whistleblower screw him alex jones tries and fails to pass off publicly
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:25.120]  available document as white house to a piece secret rush of ammo no i said here's all of it
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:31.120]  that's not still classified and it's bombshell and no one had covered it except for rob do and
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:35.600]  michael zimmerman a couple weeks before because it had been up there for a while and the white house
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:41.360]  wondered why no one saw it because they ordered the director of national intelligence to release
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:48.160]  almost all of it except who asked for it and who was being targeted and and zimmerman's like no it
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.480]  is part of it alex we didn't cover it weeks ago and i'm like great i'm so proud of us that we're
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:58.400]  the only outlet that we know of that covered it and i didn't even know we'd covered it because
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:06.480]  i missed that war room episode i think where was i was shroyer then he was out of town so it was
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:11.760]  it was zimmerman and dude at the show so it doesn't matter you know it's kind of like saying
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:17.280]  how dare someone release this to wiki leagues instead of what's in the wiki league all the
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:22.080]  crime i mean it's right here it's the whole thing three times they came to us and lied and we thought
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:26.960]  it was illegal so we told him go back and get other orders and then obama told us to do it so we did it
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:37.120]  and now we've got the actual house memo and most of the evidence in it directly talks about the
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:43.600]  faiza court word for word and how they did it and how they went to the faiza court and lied to them
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:52.640]  see here's the thing when i'm wrong about something i'll admit it but i'm not wrong
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:57.760]  but like three four percent of the time and then it's when i get dates upside down or you know get
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:03.760]  confused or say things wrong or call mccabe the director of the fbis of the deputy director i mean
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:07.600]  i know he's the deputy director i know it's ray i just i don't have teleprompter so i
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:12.320]  scramble stuff so i'll be listening to the show sometimes i'm going oh that's a mistake right
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:18.400]  there five minutes later that's a mistake but it's not substantive like the boiling temperature of
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:25.200]  water or uh you know the color of the sky at high noon it's it's just getting little factoids
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:33.840]  backwards kind of like i have informational dyslexia but overall we're dead on because
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:38.720]  we do the research and we're trying to tell the truth so when i make a mistake i'll run up and
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:42.800]  down the hallway is telling you because i want you to know hey i didn't do that on purpose but
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:49.440]  here it is enough about that we've got doug hagman of the hagman and hagman always amazing sources
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:53.600]  coming up he has a lot of good fbi sources that are more mid-level and then he's got state police
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:57.360]  that are at the highest levels and he doesn't mind us saying that because i know some of the same
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:03.600]  sources i was in new york a couple years ago and had uh i'm not going to get it high level
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:09.280]  individual at a parade walkover in uniform and i was like wow that's the that's the head of a major
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:14.240]  body uh as our big listeners love the show doug hagman's a great guy you know we're buddies
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:18.400]  going back to college and i'm just like okay that's kind of how you know doug hagman's really got
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:22.240]  those sources when you know head of a police agency comes over to tell you about doug hagman
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:27.600]  so doug hagman's coming up and he kind of get us the scuttlebutton new jersey in new york from the
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:33.680]  fbi and the state police and so uh he's got those sources and he's got some judicial sources as well
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:40.720]  but this is just such a crazy time to be alive right now and anything could happen minute to
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:46.800]  minute i'm not watching netflix at night i'm not even going to movies hardly i'm not there's always
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:51.680]  that little bit of entertainment in my life this is so entertaining because it's so real and so
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:58.240]  dangerous and i'm in it and you're in it and we got a bunch of jerks trying to block the recovery
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:04.960]  of the country and just basic america getting control of the country again donald trump's
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:13.200]  not a conservative he's a pragmatist libertarian free market guy he's a throwback
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:21.440]  people go oh we want to move forward america is the vanguard of free market and ideas even
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:25.360]  though we were a mix of bad things we were the place that had that idea that was something we
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:31.440]  were trying so we were known for that and so we're back to the future trump is the future because trump
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:39.040]  grew up not wanting to screw people over i mean if you like to go gamble and be a fool and do
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:44.000]  whatever he'll let you do that all day too he's certainly not an angel take it's just trump
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:50.080]  doesn't like seeing poor people and unhappy people he likes seeing hard-working successful people
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:53.520]  and that's what the globalist hate him because they want a bunch of demoralized losers they can

[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:33.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he lie from
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:59.680]  the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones we are back live ladies and gentlemen and i was
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:05.600]  thinking during the break what is the most important thing happening right now at this
[02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:13.440]  explosively critical point in human history now i was really thinking about it and it's this
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:19.680]  the corporate media the collaborator media that works with the multinational corporations that
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:30.000]  pretty much conquered this nation are having their power removed their monopolistic control
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:35.200]  they're still keeping all their stolen wealth and they're so arrogant and they're so angry
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:46.480]  they're putting out the lie mccain comey shift that this is a nothing burger this is nothing
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:52.160]  this is no big deal oh my gosh but it does damage our security and let the terrorists
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:56.880]  attack us and this is the worst thing ever in the end of our democracy and trumps a dictator
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:03.520]  blah blah blah even though federal law as william benney just stated shows that if crimes are
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:09.760]  committed in the fiza court or in that process law says it must be declassified but let's stop right
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:19.840]  there the average person will read the nuanced letter by the winehouse chief lawyer and chairman
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:29.760]  devin newness's letter the trained i will read it and see something different than what the public
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:40.800]  sees but it's all in plain view because at this level of fine art in its vernacular in its parlance
[02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:51.280]  it is to be done very gently as you slip the knife in between the two vertebrae in the neck
[02:22:51.280 --> 02:23:00.720]  it's done elegantly not brutishly and i read several times now and it's the letter from the president
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:07.120]  on the front page that tells you everything it says i became aware when i was president
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:12.640]  to classify information of your full operations after all it's you guys that put this giant
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:19.280]  spigot in you want to know i have full access to everything and i contacted the house committee
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:27.600]  as i'm supposed to by law and they got the information and they concur that there was
[02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:32.400]  a criminal operation to overturn my election and fraud and lies getting the warrants and all the
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:39.600]  rest of it which we have the fiza court coming to us in april of last year in a 99 page report
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:48.800]  and telling us we've been informed by the court their prime informant both in lineage and in
[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:57.440]  importance the progenitor is the judiciary alerting the president two months after he was in office
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:03.200]  january for every march april three months four months in a 99 page report of what happened
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:10.240]  then the classified parts are sent to the house intelligence committee
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:17.280]  shift works around the clock in federal court proceedings to block congressional moves and
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:23.120]  others to get the fusion gps documents that were concocted by the justice department fbi
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:28.800]  and the democratic party funded fusion gps and then all of the oh my god we need the insurance
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:33.280]  policy oh we can't let him get oh now that he's getting in we got to take him out we got to remove
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:37.760]  all that's already come out that's all in the text messages they don't deny it shift tonight at
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:41.760]  three weeks ago okay it's all real but it's nothing it's nothing burger that's their spin now
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:45.920]  as if you don't have common sense it's the end of the world total martial law from the dictator
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:52.640]  but it's no big deal and this doesn't show anything so the big issue here is that they're going to say
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:58.560]  this is nothing when the president says i don't want to release all this information
[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:03.360]  and i don't want to hurt these agencies but you're trying to hurt the country and hurt me and you've
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:08.320]  lied and i'm not going to sit here while your main operative that hillary clinton ran mueller
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:12.880]  plays this game okay i'm not just going to let you march my son everybody also off the prison
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:17.280]  so a bunch of libtards can celebrate it until the country's recovery you people are out of control
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:25.680]  stop if anything it's very judicious it's very measured it's very there's a signpost this way
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:30.480]  destruction and trump's sitting there going uh i've been down the road you don't want to go
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:37.760]  you're very close now smell the stink of dead political flesh but you look at that jackal
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:43.040]  interns face of hillary or that nutball freak combie or any of those those those lunatic
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.400]  narcissists fruit heads aren't going to stop
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:55.280]  so now you've got russia probe lawyers oh trump might get indicted see before they said oh mr
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:58.720]  president can never happen now his lawyers are oh it is coming mr president because they were
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:06.720]  always planning this getting up close to 2018 so here's the big issue this is a giant memo
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:10.800]  the cover sheet alone is bigger than the memo who's already knew all this that's in the memo
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:16.560]  it just says hey the president initiated this we've got more that's the big news we got a lot more
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:21.120]  we're ready to release that's a a is the president initiated this under the law
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:25.120]  and we've got more information and then b
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:31.680]  you guys committed a whole bunch of perjury and a whole bunch of crimes
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:37.680]  in this thing and we're ready to fight you
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:47.760]  and that's it we've got the intel you know we've got the intel we got a lot more we're ready to
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:56.720]  release you committed a bunch of crimes we're ready to go after even more just get out of
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:04.080]  the way and let the country recover and we're not going to euthanize the veterans and hillary
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:13.440]  and the democrats at msnbc and cnn are going hell no so more comes up you don't run up the wine
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:21.040]  flag more comes up and soros is already having his assets all over the world tied to human
[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:25.280]  smuggling i mean he's been caught shipping in hundreds of thousands out of north africa alone
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:30.160]  on those on those uh zodiac rubber boats that's in the news the italian navy just stopped them
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:35.600]  two weeks ago that the italians got a call from somebody called nato called trump
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:38.640]  because the united states is nato
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:45.760]  so you first trump threatened to cut nato's funding off to get him under control now we're in control
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:50.800]  again of nato not soros in the e u and now we're telling soros we're taking you down you know
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:54.080]  there's the headline george soros linked to funding human trafficking and terrorism and
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:58.640]  guess what oh some stuff's happening to soros right now you want to move against soros oh what's
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:06.880]  going on so there is the compendium of trump i know i'm the president i've got you dead to rights

[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:46.480]  because trump knows metaphysically he's gotta be the good guy he's gotta be taking the high road
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:51.920]  he's gotta be the one that's defending so he just keeps giving him chance after chance after chance

[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:28.480]  hagman report one of our great law enforcement sources on the east coast with the fbi the
[02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:32.960]  state police you name it oh my god it's broken so much the big news here it's going to be hosting
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:37.520]  the fourth hour along with a lot of new clips as the president speaks how things develop
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:41.920]  and we're going to him here in just a few minutes though and i do intend this sunday when i'm back
[02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:46.480]  four to six p.m we're going to take phone calls your response to memo all of it but for me again
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:53.760]  the big takeaway uh with this whole situation is that the president's saying i'm ready to release
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:58.800]  more we're standing up we're fighting you this is criminal we're exposing what you did we're
[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:01.840]  calling you out we're not just going to sit here and lay down and take it and you purge
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:08.560]  it yourselves three times to get these warrants and then you targeted people politically so that's
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:13.360]  coming up i also want to play a clip of the president's response earlier uh talking about
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:17.200]  how they should be ashamed of themselves and the media spend that says the whole fbi or the whole
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:22.880]  government they're the one saying that it's clinton criminal groups like a hijacker of a plane
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:29.680]  the average rank and file folks at the fbi uh are are really awake and i only discovered that in
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:33.920]  the last decade when i ran into folks and got documents from the fbi and federal marshals
[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:37.520]  and others i've just found the fbi at the grassroots level to be very very helpful in
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:42.480]  anti-new world order that's what william benny's a big patriot former head of the nsa he said listen
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:47.680]  i found the fbi is the scapegoat for all the deep state agencies that use it to hide behind
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:51.840]  and then they run around like erin boys now i'm not sitting here defending the fbi and the actions
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:55.760]  of its history and what it's done but do you ever hear about the 17 agencies other than maybe the
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:03.520]  cia or no you don't yeah yeah it's all fbi when something secret comes out on my show this order
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:07.760]  by the army to go grab some witness you know and call them into the army i mean the fbi are like
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:13.440]  erin boys so they become kind of the scapegoat even with the democrats that are inside when they get
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:19.360]  caught committing crimes they then go oh don't attack the fbi we're the fbi no you're not talking
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:25.760]  scarface from the which is based on a cosmology of true stories uh it's the guy that wrote that was
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:31.600]  of course uh you know the same guy that made snowed and all the rest of it uh but oliver stone
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:35.120]  he said tony mentana's sitting there with the corrupt cop that's trying to get him assassinated
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.320]  and he says get ready i'm gonna kill you and he goes you can't kill me i'm a cop
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:46.800]  and he goes whoever said you was one and that's what we're coming down to here comies on an fbi
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:52.320]  agent mueller's on an fbi agent mccabe's on fbi agent their deep state clinton operatives
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:57.520]  good god hillary gave his wife 500 000 cash she kept a couple years ago i mean think of what we
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:01.920]  don't know about ladies and gentlemen so we're gonna go to doug hagman here in just a moment

[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:58.880]  intel on this memo what it really means in about two minutes but first i wanted to play the president
[02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:02.560]  earlier today right we started the broadcast he made this statement when he was about to meet with
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:08.240]  north korean uh defectors who left that dictatorship and and how horrified they were and how scared
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:14.000]  even be you know still of kim jong-un uh but but first he made this statement about the release
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:21.120]  of this congressional memo detailing the roadmap of criminality here it is i think i think it's
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:25.520]  terrible you want to know the truth i think it's a disgrace what's going on in this country i think
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:31.760]  it's a disgrace the memo was sent to congress it was declassified congress will do whatever
[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:36.800]  they're going to do but i think it's a disgrace what's happening in our country and when you
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:42.880]  look at that and you see that and so many other things what's going on a lot of people should
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:49.120]  be ashamed of themselves and much worse than that so i sent it over to congress they will do what
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:56.000]  they're going to do whatever they do is fine it was declassified and let's see what happens but a
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:04.800]  lot of people should be ashamed thank you very much thank you very much stop there again i cannot
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:10.240]  quantify how historical this is trump is teaching us how to fight again he is taking out the hijack
[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:15.200]  networks inside the government that have taken over these agencies and groups he is removing the poison
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:20.160]  in my view i want to get doug hagman's brief take before he takes over in a moment on am i right in
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:25.600]  my assessment and i know he always has amazing intel so again ladies and gentlemen doug hagman
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:31.200]  of haggam report dot com tell us what you know i'll tell you what i've been glued to your broadcast
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:39.440]  the entire day a historic day you are absolutely correct this is this is the biggest scandal the
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:46.240]  biggest crime that that we have we have seen at least in my lifetime i mean this doors watergate
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:51.920]  the um the superlatives this cannot be understated the importance thereof cannot be understated
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:59.440]  the bottom line here is this the exposure of the uh the coup the attempted coup by the weaponized
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:05.760]  department of justice by the weaponized fbi known by uh certain rank and file members of the fbi
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:12.240]  who are actually white hats exposing this as well bottom line uh they went after donald trump
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:17.920]  they're going after the american people this is an ongoing um issue and also the bottom
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:23.680]  line is this this people think that this memo the the three page three three and a quarter page memo
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:31.280]  is in fact the the end this is just the beginning and it's going to get much worse the exposure of
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:36.160]  the deep state operatives the shadow government the people the swamp creatures this is going to get
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:42.000]  much worse and there will be i'll tell you what people will go in this is what i'm hearing there
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:46.960]  will be charges laid against certain individuals within the department of justice current and
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:54.560]  former because of this information and information that supports this document um and the names of
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:42:02.400]  course within the document as well as those implied whether it be bruce or or peter struck they are
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:09.360]  they're worried and they should be and the last thing and i i just really want to drive this
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:18.080]  point home alex this is a scandal crime more appropriate that goes directly to the office
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:26.320]  or to the white house to the obama white house obama knew totally he knew about this in fact he
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:33.680]  facilitated exactly what we read in this three and a half page memo he facilitated this he was a part
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:39.360]  of it the presidential daily briefings contained information and if people knew this is what i'm
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:45.520]  getting if people knew the contents of the presidential daily briefings they would be
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:51.520]  absolutely astounded at the level of complicity by barak hussein obama very you just shut it and

[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:44.320]  we're back live i'm alex jones your host doug hagman an amazing source
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:49.520]  his own broadcaster long a career in law enforcement a lot of activities on the east coast
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:56.000]  joins us hagman report.com this excellent website amazing information that he's broken so many times
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:04.560]  here but if you just joined us ladies and gentlemen we've gotten pieces of this foreshadowed
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:11.440]  by the house intelligence committee by senators as well that have seen the larger body of the
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:15.840]  intelligence this was a very light shot across the bow the fact that they're willing to fight back
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:19.920]  and the fact that they said they have more that's the big shot across the bow that they're
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:22.800]  they're they're waiting to use but it's very very limited but what hagman just said
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:29.360]  we saw members of congress some of which have joined us saying oh this will embarrass obama
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:39.760]  this this will embarrass uh the president and take the shine off him and that's exactly what
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:48.400]  we've already seen in the campaign at the nomination when he was then running against
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:53.920]  hillary as the nominee and then when he was president-elect right before the nomination they
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:58.880]  start surveillance when he's running against hillary they open up another warrant to spawn
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:03.600]  even more people with one warrant they can spot on millions in dragnets that's admitted they keep
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:08.320]  going oh big deal we spot on this car you know this person down here or whatever it's a larger
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:13.600]  dragnet and then once he's president-elect they had a couple months november 8th until january 20th
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:19.200]  and they went really crazy then but couldn't find anything so now they had to cover it all up
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:28.800]  so for me the big issue here and the thing that's hiding in plain view is that
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:33.520]  obama with the justice department working with the democratic party we now know
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:40.400]  was han showing this and i have been told by sources that that's the ace card that trump
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:47.360]  holds one of many cards but it's the ace of spades is that the president of the united states
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:56.880]  iraq is saying obama 44 called a royal flush if you want was getting daily briefings
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:04.160]  during the last weeks of the campaign and right through on directed white house programs as we
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:07.920]  know is the people under him had to unmask the trump folks that were following they were in the
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:12.640]  white house surveilling trump and his family and myself and roger stone that's admitted
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:18.080]  but that the president was getting briefings purely political off that investigation off what
[02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:22.720]  trump was doing what he was saying what he was planning it's not enough that they see an end we
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:27.840]  now know in wiki leagues was giving the debate questions to donald brazil weeks before so hillary
[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:32.960]  had a more all three moderators ganged up on all the shows including fox all the rigging like
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:38.320]  gladiator he's fighting you know the five tigers and the and you know the you have the champion from
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:44.800]  gall i mean it's that rig and still he won still we won still because we woke up we overpowered them
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:49.120]  and that's what hagman was just getting to he's taken over in the next hour but dug that is bombshell
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:52.720]  because that's what we know they were doing in the white house but that's what i'm hearing
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:56.960]  is coming out next is they've got his executive privilege won't work president the president
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:51:02.080]  if it's illegal the word is trump has witnesses and people ready to go forward that they were
[02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:08.640]  using the white house as a command base with the nsa trying to stop prompt from getting an office
[02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:13.680]  this is a 50 000 times worse than richard millhouse nixon is that what you're saying from your sources
[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:24.240]  100 percent precisely and and one can go back to november 17 of 2016 when admiral mike rogers
[02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:30.560]  head of the nsa broke ranks made an unscheduled visit to trump tower you've covered this met with
[02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:35.440]  don met with donald trump and in that meeting we don't know of course what he said but certainly
[02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:41.360]  the effects of what he said were clear because of the next day donald trump moved from trump tower
[02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:48.960]  again as president elect to the golf course and bed minister of new jersey because of what
[02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:53.840]  mike rogers said and basically what rogers said and i'm speculating here is the fact that hey
[02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:58.800]  but again he didn't give the heads up he went there to report the treason that that's right
[02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:04.400]  and then right after that of course you saw clapper and others calling for rogers rogers
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:11.280]  to be fired because of the breaking ranks but this all the roads lead right back to obama
[02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:18.720]  and and as well as the parallel roads lead back to clinton because with with hillary clinton as well
[02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:26.400]  i just have to mention this hillary clinton using a private server set up
[02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:32.160]  uh barak who's saying obama in the white house communicated from russian soil on a private
[02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:40.080]  server to hillary clinton while she was in russia thereby enjoining him in this conspiracy where he
[02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:46.880]  was powerless essentially to sign off on any prosecution of hillary clinton in the server
[02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:51.760]  issue the private email issue the reason i bring this up is because all of these are components
[02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:59.440]  of a larger more widespread series of criminal activity that we are now seeing that that this
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:04.880]  three and a half page memo or three and a quarter page memo is alluding to in some respects these
[02:53:04.880 --> 02:53:12.160]  surveillance and by the way it was the entire thing this was a setup this was a sting operation
[02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:18.880]  against donald trump and people need to understand that this was this was a surveillance operation
[02:53:18.880 --> 02:53:24.160]  against a person without a preg it without their own record sending in democratic party operatives
[02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:31.280]  like this natalia lady from soros saying it's about uh adoption stuff and and and and then
[02:53:31.280 --> 02:53:34.960]  changing the subject when it's admitted that it's their operative and that blew up in their face
[02:53:34.960 --> 02:53:40.640]  because trump is so straight lace yeah and you've got glenn simpson from fusion gps testifying
[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:47.520]  before the house and senate denying that that he knows for example natalia is on the sky yet he
[02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:53.920]  met with her the day before and the day after that that donald trump meeting um where where the
[02:53:53.920 --> 02:54:00.080]  information was supposed to be disclosed to donald trump jr what this is insane but this lays bare
[02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:06.960]  in my view the the absolute i can't even find the the right words for this except to say
[02:54:06.960 --> 02:54:11.760]  this is a sting operation against donald trump this is an attempted coup an attempted political
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:17.600]  assassination by the highest levels in the fbi and the doj and look i i'm all for a law and order
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:22.400]  i'm all for the doj i was an operational asset for the fbi in the 90s but i gotta tell you something
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:28.400]  never never would any fbi agent i know would ever put up with this or anyone from the department
[02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:33.520]  of justice this was a sting operation designed to uh politically assassinate donald trump
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:40.800]  and it it almost worked it and i was about to say the recklessness of it is is frightening i mean
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:45.600]  this isn't like lying on intelligence to launch some new war that's bad enough you're trying to
[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:50.240]  overthrow an election of people that really want to return the country claiming they're russian agents
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:54.960]  when you're up to your eyeballs with chinese and russian collusion yourself the here's the thing
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:55:01.680]  this isn't business as usual trump as i as he knows cannot allow them to continue on i get
[02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:05.440]  to be fires a bunch of them uh right now they go oh look you're doing that because you're desperate
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:11.920]  no it's his duty now as the executive to fire rozenstein who we know is now running all this i mean
[02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:20.800]  it's it's insane i mean it's really insane oh insane to the max but i think now you're gonna see
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:28.720]  uh over the next 24 48 72 hours i think you're gonna see people um obviously luring up
[02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:34.560]  seeking legal counsel you're gonna see some resignations probably next week you're gonna
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:38.080]  see some people escorted from their their offices just like it's like a cave this week
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:46.560]  yeah yes yes but this will be even uh uh more uh more broad because from this three and a
[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:52.160]  quarter page memo they know meaning the deep state they know they've got a lot more the
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:57.520]  foundational documentation for this memo and you went over that uh which was a brilliant uh that 99
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:04.240]  page uh fiza audit that she went over with with mr benny last week just take a look at that
[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:09.040]  and and that's got that's got the three cases that were masked that's blacked out that when
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:13.120]  they said this is illegal fiza was telling the president sir in april this is illegal
[02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:17.920]  and gave him the report and i know that white house wanted that on the air and and i'm the media
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:24.320]  just covered it up yep of course the media is complicit in this and when you look at the
[02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:30.560]  at the level of complicity by the media and and by the way the the fusion gps documents and i know
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:34.960]  that this is kind of being shocking around here a little bit but when you when you look at what's
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:42.560]  being requested from fusion gps and what it was turned over we saw the credit side of the bank
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:49.120]  records from fusion gps but what we didn't say yet is the debit side who they paid in the media
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:55.840]  to uh to propagate the russian collusion story when that hits and when that when that gets out in
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:57:00.800]  the open there are a lot of people who are going to say oh man well that's the word congress has
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:05.520]  leaked that reportedly two million through the fbi adjust department went to family members that were
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:11.440]  at gps or his wife they tried to deny it but word is they've they've committed perjury the word is
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:16.000]  that that they have the documents is that what you've been told absolutely they've got the documents
[02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:21.360]  in fact the officer the officer the inspector general michael horowitz has
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:26.400]  additional documents you go back to the texts that were lost never lost they've had them that was
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:29.360]  something totally let me ask you about that when we come back i'll host a little bit with you the

[03:00:02.160 --> 03:00:20.000]  you know you watch the democrats the globalist on tv and the blue blood republican scumbags and
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:26.080]  it's just total bish because i know i researched what's going on and then i look at my guests like
[03:00:26.080 --> 03:00:32.160]  hagman or what i'm doing or our sources i mean i think about the sources i've got sometimes and i
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:36.160]  just i don't even deserve this it's kind of like william betty said he goes this is a shame alex
[03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:39.520]  you're one of the only shows will put this out you know this should be on bigger and it's like
[03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:43.280]  i don't think that's an insult it's it's true that guy should be on nightline you know that guy should
[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:50.400]  be on meet the press but but you know it's it's incredible the fact that we're in the middle of
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:55.200]  a second american revolution the economy's coming back if you were artificially suppressed you've
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:01:02.880]  got a crazy deep state on the chinese communist payroll man they're like puppets and we are we
[03:01:02.880 --> 03:01:08.000]  are just in the middle of this and then i see a third of the population smoking the new world
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:14.480]  order dope that literally think we're nazis and when when soros is a nazi and and and running
[03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:21.520]  almost all of this he's like the evil engine behind it the will it just it makes my mind
[03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:29.360]  boggle doug hagman it's just i don't know how to quantify historically where we are right now
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:35.600]  you know i was thinking about that this morning and as the memo actually came out
[03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:44.240]  look i believe right now today we sit in the most perilous time in american history one of the most
[03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:49.520]  significant times in american history and i don't see that lightly because i know all of the
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:55.840]  um um how this could be blown out of proportion but when you see the fact that during the revolution
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:02:01.680]  we did uh the reasons for the first american revolution and we see what's happening today
[03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:08.720]  look we don't have an mi5 as sabash and gorka had said we don't have this secret police internal
[03:02:08.720 --> 03:02:14.640]  with within our government yet this is exactly what we're seeing having been formed you just
[03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:20.320]  quantified that's it the clinton's had set up a secret police pictorian guard within key federal
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:25.680]  agencies openly involved in espionage not against trump but against the will of the voters in our
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:34.240]  republic itself this is treason absolutely treason sedition and uh look you know i i was joking
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:40.400]  earlier today i i would maybe should buy some uh stock and rope companies and i and i don't say
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:45.440]  that lightly nor do i um i don't want to sound glib about it but but i've i've got to tell you
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:50.800]  when you look at all of these scandals all of these crimes combined um and when the shoe fits
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:56.400]  where is it i i mean look exactly if trump doesn't go after the magress i don't want vengeance i don't
[03:02:56.400 --> 03:03:00.640]  want to corner people but we're already they're already cornered they won't give up we have to
[03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:07.040]  dash them out now yeah if not if not now when we're not going to have another opportunity this is
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:11.040]  it and that's why god is giving us our one shot i'm sorry i'm interrupting you we're saying is
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:15.440]  total veritas this exactly and look when i say stuff it makes me public enemy number one when i
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:21.200]  say we got to get them and they but i just can't lie we have to crush them right well there's no
[03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:28.240]  other alternative except crush them or be crushed expose them or forever lose that opportunity
[03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:34.800]  at this point and this is what i believe um these overlapping crimes i'd look look the the crimes of
[03:03:34.800 --> 03:03:41.280]  hillary clinton will come out the crimes of lois learner under the well i could select any number
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:46.720]  of names and individuals under the obama regime they're all going to come to the forefront and
[03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:51.200]  it's because of um for example the uh house permanent select committee on intelligence
[03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:55.680]  devon newness pushing this to the forefront it's because of michael horowitz the office of the
[03:03:55.680 --> 03:04:00.080]  inspector i was about to say if it wasn't for these men and women's courage we would not we
[03:04:00.080 --> 03:04:05.040]  finally had real people in congress so it wasn't just trump or the media or the people the planets
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:11.440]  aligned didn't they about exactly the confluence of events and the fact is in everyone listening to
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:16.640]  this uh we are being presented all of us individually and collectively with an opportunity to take
[03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:21.200]  our country back and we need to do that right now because if we don't do it now it's we're not going
[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:23.360]  to be let's come back and talk about that then i'm going to get out of here because i want you
[03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:27.120]  to host the show but you're just on fire because we're all on fire this is a spiritual choice isn't
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:32.720]  it god knows about our covenant america was based in christianity and this is our last chance we're
[03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:37.760]  all thinking oh this is great if we make the wrong decision on the stub you agree that that
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:43.520]  we're going to be totally turned over to evil exactly god i've never had chills this strong
[03:04:43.520 --> 03:04:48.800]  i'm not kidding i'm on fire right now i i think i'm burning right now because the energy is so
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:53.440]  strong right now because as goes america show goes the world this is the future destiny
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:05:00.880]  president trump is expected to swiftly declassify the controversial fiza memo the news comes
[03:05:00.880 --> 03:05:06.480]  after the fbi issued a rare public statement saying it had grave concerns about its release
[03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:11.280]  which could be detrimental to national security fbi director christopher rey is reportedly
[03:05:11.280 --> 03:05:16.000]  pressuring the white house to redact all names in the memo prior to its release so much for
[03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:21.440]  transparency congressman jeff duncan says the release of the fiza memo will shake the fbi
[03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:27.120]  to its core he revealed that the document exposes how the agency was weaponized by hillary clinton
[03:05:27.120 --> 03:05:32.240]  and the obama administration to spy on the trump campaign representative adam schiff has tried to
[03:05:32.240 --> 03:05:37.520]  block the release of the damning fiza memo saying he discovered material changes to it chairman
[03:05:37.520 --> 03:05:42.880]  new yens's office said the changes were minor and blasted the complaint as a bizarre distraction
[03:05:42.880 --> 03:05:47.600]  from the abuses detailed in the memo and the soon to be released fiza memo has been a trending
[03:05:47.600 --> 03:05:53.600]  topic for days because the deep state tried so hard to suppress it leon macadoo info wars dot com
[03:06:06.480 --> 03:06:14.000]  coming to you from the former united states of america from deep in the heart of texas it's alex
[03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:20.880]  jones
[03:06:24.720 --> 03:06:32.240]  doug hagman is on fire i'm on fire we're all on fire because this signifies elements of congress
[03:06:32.240 --> 03:06:38.400]  the presidency the courts fiza came to the president in april and said sir they brought us
[03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:41.760]  three illegal warrants on you and we said no but they brought them back and it was ordered by the
[03:06:41.760 --> 03:06:52.640]  president and now you have the fiza court you have congress you have the president that's all three
[03:06:52.640 --> 03:06:57.440]  branches trump is doing everything by the book that's what's amazing in iran paul said i could
[03:06:57.440 --> 03:07:01.760]  never be a dictator it'll be hard to fix things trump isn't doing it as a dictator he's doing it the
[03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:07.520]  way you're supposed to by sheer force of will making hundreds of phone calls a day going and
[03:07:07.520 --> 03:07:12.720]  meeting with people uh that's why they hate him i mean it's it's messianic the energy the way
[03:07:12.720 --> 03:07:18.480]  trump hid all this except his dad was giving the john birch society money he was writing op eds against
[03:07:18.480 --> 03:07:22.880]  napkin gad i talked folks that were hanging out with trump 20 30 40 years ago he bitching complain
[03:07:22.880 --> 03:07:27.680]  about can't somebody really run and turn this around make america even more wealthier more wealth
[03:07:27.680 --> 03:07:31.680]  makes more wealth plunging us down doesn't raise the world up i mean trump just gets fundamental
[03:07:31.680 --> 03:07:37.760]  economics and he likes prosperity he's a service oriented billionaire uh the blue collar service
[03:07:37.760 --> 03:07:43.520]  billionaire and so i mean he'll break your neck if you take a swing at him but he's not out to just
[03:07:43.520 --> 03:07:47.520]  oh look at that family they're good looking they got a nice family and they got a nice house i want
[03:07:47.520 --> 03:07:53.680]  to make them poor so i run them trump's like the ghost of christmas present ladies and gentlemen
[03:07:53.680 --> 03:07:58.480]  he wants prosperity and that doesn't fit into the austerity world government view of the globalist
[03:07:58.480 --> 03:08:05.920]  that want to make you poor so doug just recapping the epic moment we've reached um the train derailment
[03:08:05.920 --> 03:08:11.760]  the attacks the trump and the republicans meeting in that bunker yesterday before i mean they know
[03:08:11.760 --> 03:08:15.600]  this is all coming to a head they know they're the globalists are getting ready to make their move
[03:08:15.600 --> 03:08:22.560]  mueller is so narcissistic and insane the word is he's going to go ahead and get that swamp jury
[03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:27.360]  in dc to indict i mean out of the swamp uh i mean i've talked to people that have been there it's
[03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:34.080]  been in the news they say it's like a anti for black lives matter uh glorious steinham event uh and
[03:08:34.080 --> 03:08:38.640]  so what happens there the attempt to impeach i guess 2018 is everything while trump tries to
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:44.480]  right the ship get the deep state out of total control turn the economy back on we've got to watch
[03:08:44.480 --> 03:08:50.480]  his six in these upcoming elections where we saw with roi moore whether you love him or hate him
[03:08:50.480 --> 03:08:56.560]  15 points behind in polls loses by half a point democrats showing up in airplanes and buses saying
[03:08:56.560 --> 03:09:01.600]  we got names of dead people we're going to go vote i mean they stole that election we now know
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:07.920]  katie bar the door they are total blue wave attack and if we go to sleep and are self confident
[03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:14.080]  even though we're having initial victories because of trump's uh gravity well we are gonna i think
[03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:21.520]  lose the big one if we let him get surrounded what do you think yes uh exactly i i think we need to
[03:09:21.520 --> 03:09:27.760]  uh well make sure our we are buckled in and our seatbacks and trade tables are in their full
[03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:32.640]  upright and locked position because there will be blowback you can expect blowback from the
[03:09:32.640 --> 03:09:39.040]  deep state from the shadow government this will not go without response uh and we've seen it we've
[03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:45.600]  seen the pathetic attempts by adam schiff and others about this uh in response to this memo
[03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:50.880]  but see again this is just the first shot across the bow what comes next is the foundational documents
[03:09:50.880 --> 03:09:58.240]  for this what comes next is the implications or or the um uh yeah the the groundwork to to uh not
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:04.880]  just dismantle the legacy of barracusan obama as as donald trump is doing which is just infuriates the
[03:10:04.880 --> 03:10:12.480]  deep state but uh it holds to account those individuals who have really attempted to subjugate
[03:10:12.480 --> 03:10:18.800]  all of america to uh and overturn an election and overturn the will of will of the people look these
[03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:24.800]  people are are out for blood their their death grip on their um attempts to maintain power it's just
[03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:30.240]  absolutely this is a no quarter given none none received none given back this is a death battle
[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:36.400]  yes yeah and i think people need to realize the the serious the the serious nature of what we're
[03:10:36.400 --> 03:10:41.680]  seeing here uh the people within the deep state just as we saw hillary clinton not going away
[03:10:41.680 --> 03:10:46.640]  quietly barraque obama not going away quietly establishing a beachhead on embassy road there
[03:10:46.640 --> 03:10:51.760]  uh with a complete with a skiff look there's a reason for that there's a reason why these people
[03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:56.320]  aren't going away quietly and that also goes back to the uh december 21st because they've
[03:10:56.320 --> 03:11:01.680]  committed such massive crimes their own underlings they're having to pay off they know will come after
[03:11:01.680 --> 03:11:06.480]  them they've got a lot of guaranteed payments made and as their saudi money gets cut off as their
[03:11:06.480 --> 03:11:11.280]  chinese money gets cut off as their vatican money gets cut off as their eeyu money gets cut off as
[03:11:11.280 --> 03:11:15.360]  their hollywood money gets cut off all the people they were paying off are going to come out against
[03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:20.320]  them so that's why we can't just they're not going to give us quarter even though we're kicking
[03:11:20.320 --> 03:11:24.880]  their butt i mean i'm not and here's the deal folks i get it battle they've already come in
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:29.520]  and i'm not going to complain about the stuff they've done a lot of it's public some of it's not
[03:11:29.520 --> 03:11:34.000]  but i mean up to a hundred journalists so-called journalists in the room trying to make me lose
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:40.240]  my kids you know the message comes down from my oh hi rollover this will all stop i mean you know
[03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:45.440]  and i'm kind of proud of myself most men say yeah you know i'll i'll rollover if uh if you you know
[03:11:45.440 --> 03:11:51.120]  leave me alone hell no but the point is people you know how serious this is a lot of us have made
[03:11:51.120 --> 03:11:56.320]  big sacrifices to bring us to this point me one of the least but i'll tell you the hell the trumps
[03:11:56.320 --> 03:12:01.520]  have gone through just the experience i've had has has been unbelievable it's made me much stronger
[03:12:01.520 --> 03:12:07.040]  and have a much bigger soul but and so i've actually very pleased i'm very honored i i appreciate
[03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:11.600]  the persecution i don't say that to mess with my enemies i have it's these these trials have really
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:18.720]  helped me uh blossom but but people understand this is a real war and you know yeah people need
[03:12:18.720 --> 03:12:24.560]  to understand that this is this is far beyond the political candidates this goes into the
[03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:31.600]  journalistic venue people are under surveillance you're under surveillance we're under surveillance
[03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:38.800]  and and um look this whole thing what's going what's taking place right now is to attempt to
[03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:45.200]  shut us up to shut us down to to shut you up and shut you down same with us uh people like
[03:12:45.200 --> 03:12:50.640]  sean hannity and and and sarah carter isn't sean hannity a champion he's just fantastic
[03:12:50.640 --> 03:12:56.640]  yeah yeah and and he look look uh for whatever people want to say about sean hannity at least
[03:12:56.640 --> 03:13:01.280]  he's the one that's out front covering well he used to toady around with bush back when things
[03:13:01.280 --> 03:13:05.440]  weren't totally clear but now that it's clear there's no going back for hannity and it's a big victory
[03:13:06.400 --> 03:13:11.120]  absolutely and he knows that and i know people in direct contact with sean hannity on a daily
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:14.960]  basis yeah tell folks i want to the media makes a big deal about it but he i mean you know it's
[03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:20.080]  true i mean and then they spun it said he thanked me no he thanked us through david night and others
[03:13:20.080 --> 03:13:24.320]  and through some other people and and it doesn't matter the point is is that he understands it now
[03:13:24.320 --> 03:13:28.800]  he understands he was he was a kind of a good old boy who believed the system wasn't as dirty as
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:34.160]  we said because he wasn't a bad guy he is kind of a you know boy scout uh eagle scout type guy but
[03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:39.680]  now that the eagle scout type guys finally get its real they're in the fight now absolutely and
[03:13:39.680 --> 03:13:44.560]  there are so many people want to take him down take us down take all of us down this is a street
[03:13:44.560 --> 03:13:50.800]  fight right now not now it's turning from uh the ethereal if you will now now it's real it's it's

[03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:06.320]  but i was glued to info wars all day to throughout the program today the information that is coming
[03:21:06.320 --> 03:21:12.800]  out the the obviously the white house uh uh or the um uh the the unclassified memo that came out
[03:21:12.800 --> 03:21:18.480]  today making big news and of course the white house statement that came out with it big news
[03:21:18.480 --> 03:21:23.520]  but the the real biggest news i think and i i think um this came through with our conversation
[03:21:23.520 --> 03:21:29.120]  between alex and myself is the fact that this is bigger than people can really imagine
[03:21:29.120 --> 03:21:37.360]  what we're talking about here is is the is is the um what would you call it it's exposing
[03:21:37.360 --> 03:21:43.680]  all of the evil machinations of the deep state somebody finally stands up oh the famous interrupter
[03:21:43.680 --> 03:21:50.000]  sorry somebody finally stands out i'm glad you are now exactly no well thanks well thanks for uh
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:54.240]  thanks for you know hey i look again i'm new at this but but thanks for you're not new at this
[03:21:54.240 --> 03:21:57.760]  you reach millions people a week dug your badass no but what you're saying is what is the word i'm
[03:21:57.760 --> 03:22:02.000]  sitting there watching about to eat my lunch is that is it finally somebody's draining the swamp
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:05.920]  this is how you do it he's calling their damn bluff he's like john wane but for real
[03:22:06.480 --> 03:22:10.160]  you got four guys lined up against one he says listen you want to five fill your in son of a
[03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:15.360]  bitch dug i'm leaving i'm gonna go in the break room and eat eat lunch take over all right yeah
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:19.680]  next time i'll buy lunch next time but but you know alex is right and if you go back through
[03:22:19.680 --> 03:22:26.800]  the progress i guess this is the issue that i'm i'm really just absolutely astounded by when you
[03:22:26.800 --> 03:22:34.720]  look at the uh in the lead up to this day this memo day this infamous february second memo day
[03:22:34.720 --> 03:22:40.960]  when you look up to the lead up to what we have seen what has been exposed how much has been exposed
[03:22:40.960 --> 03:22:46.800]  already that people uh well that people just didn't didn't quite understand or didn't get
[03:22:46.800 --> 03:22:53.680]  i i recall alex doing the uh the uh show with uh william benny about the the well the 99 page
[03:22:54.400 --> 03:23:01.600]  fiza document of course uh or the fiza audit and in that the structured information in that
[03:23:01.600 --> 03:23:08.640]  that led up to today's uh release the classified memo look here's what we're watching i believe
[03:23:09.280 --> 03:23:16.560]  in a nutshell just to kind of bring this home this is really simple we have got in my view anyway
[03:23:16.560 --> 03:23:23.280]  we've got a foreign agent when you look at the memo itself and analyze the memo you've got a foreign
[03:23:23.280 --> 03:23:30.880]  agent christopher steele who absolutely despised the donald trump who was used by the democratic
[03:23:30.880 --> 03:23:38.240]  party by hillary the diane rodham clinton the hillary clinton campaign the dnc the political
[03:23:38.240 --> 03:23:44.960]  supporters in the fbi and the department of justice in an attempt to subvert our presidential
[03:23:44.960 --> 03:23:50.960]  election to subvert the will of the people to this is equivalent to a political assassination
[03:23:50.960 --> 03:23:56.160]  and i know alex has gone through this but this is so important because what we're seeing today is
[03:23:56.160 --> 03:24:02.160]  history in the making the us constitution is not a document that should be shredded and this is
[03:24:02.160 --> 03:24:09.360]  exactly what we saw the the attempted shredding of well the the actual uh uh attack on our constitution
[03:24:09.360 --> 03:24:15.680]  but more importantly and and think about this what what we saw was not just merely
[03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:22.160]  an attempt to change the outcome of an election but it's even bigger than that it's the attempt to
[03:24:22.160 --> 03:24:29.200]  change the trajectory of a nation and when you think about that and let that sink in for a second
[03:24:29.200 --> 03:24:35.360]  it's just not about donald trump it's just not about the republican party or the donald trump
[03:24:35.360 --> 03:24:44.720]  supporters it's about the nation our nation the united states of america it's an attempt to change
[03:24:44.720 --> 03:24:52.000]  the course of our history and by the grace of god almighty that didn't happen and we
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:57.760]  does everyone realize how close we came this would have never seen the light of day with a
[03:24:57.760 --> 03:25:04.640]  clinton hillary clinton um in the oval office everything would have been buried but getting
[03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:12.240]  back to what uh alex alex had said uh and talked about the throughout the show to accomplish this
[03:25:12.240 --> 03:25:19.520]  attack we saw the former fbi director and i'm going to get very specific here based on my analysis
[03:25:19.520 --> 03:25:26.560]  of this memo we saw the former fbi director james comey knowingly and will willfully signing off
[03:25:26.560 --> 03:25:36.480]  on a faiza application to spy to wiretap on american citizens obviously donald trump obviously
[03:25:36.480 --> 03:25:44.800]  that his team his campaign staff but during his time as a as an american citizen not yet
[03:25:44.800 --> 03:25:52.240]  elected during his time after uh as a as a republican nominee for president and just an american
[03:25:52.240 --> 03:25:59.760]  citizen during his time as a president elect and even during his time as the president of the united
[03:25:59.760 --> 03:26:06.720]  states it let that sink in consider the ramifications here they deliberately concealed the the actors
[03:26:06.720 --> 03:26:14.720]  behind the faiza warrant application process if we want to focus there the actors there um the the
[03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:22.320]  fact that they lie they there was a material uh the material omissions deliberate omissions
[03:26:22.880 --> 03:26:29.360]  lies by omission lies by commission uh the fact that they were telling the court the faiza court
[03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:35.440]  judge who by the way i'll just i'll just say this i believe that the faiza court judge and i don't
[03:26:35.440 --> 03:26:39.920]  know how many people that have looked at this because the faiza court is a rather small entity
[03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:44.960]  rude off contraris i'll be getting back to that in a second i'll tell you why i believe that to
[03:26:44.960 --> 03:26:50.160]  be the case and just keep that in the back of your mind remember names are important dates are
[03:26:50.160 --> 03:26:55.920]  important uh and names and dates together are extremely important but i'm kind of mapping
[03:26:55.920 --> 03:27:02.720]  this out for you um the the opposition this is not just mere opposition research this was an
[03:27:02.720 --> 03:27:08.960]  attempt to shred the constitution to change the will of the american people and it was exposed
[03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:15.680]  through michael horowitz it was exposed through devon newness and his committee the house intelligence
[03:27:15.680 --> 03:27:20.800]  committee and by the way you've heard alex talk about uh and others on his program talk about
[03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:27.520]  the awan brothers the pakistani spy ring in congress oh you don't think that look that's
[03:27:27.520 --> 03:27:33.520]  got a place in this as well but that's at the periphery of everything you see whether it's
[03:27:33.520 --> 03:27:39.440]  whether it's ben gazi whether it's the pakistani spy ring whether it's the email private servers
[03:27:39.440 --> 03:27:45.440]  whether it's the faiza application warrant um there's more to this this is just the beginning
[03:27:45.440 --> 03:27:50.320]  this three and a half page or three and a quarter page memo that was released today is just the
[03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:56.480]  first shot across across the bow remember this is not the end this is not the the midpoint this
[03:27:56.480 --> 03:28:02.480]  is just the beginning and what what is going to happen next of course is going to be uh as i mentioned
[03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:09.360]  with alex is going to be a there will be blowback an intense blowback but we will be engaged in war
[03:28:09.360 --> 03:28:14.720]  but getting back and i'm i feel like i'm i feel like i got ad d going back through but but look
[03:28:14.720 --> 03:28:22.160]  getting to this faiza memo at the very least we saw deliberate omissions commissions lies by
[03:28:22.160 --> 03:28:31.760]  omission lies by commission perjury at its face appears there to be done by mr comie at the very
[03:28:31.760 --> 03:28:37.760]  least deputy assistant director of the fbi andrew mccabe he knew these facts yet he too proceeded
[03:28:37.760 --> 03:28:45.200]  to engage in this conduct folks you're listening to info wars thug hagman sitting in for alex jones

[03:33:51.360 --> 03:33:56.400]  dossier formed an essential part of the initial and all three renewal faiza applications against
[03:33:56.400 --> 03:34:02.000]  carter page andrew mccabe confirmed that no faiza warrant would have been sought from the faiza court
[03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:08.240]  without the steel dossier information the political origins of the steel dossier were known to senior
[03:34:08.240 --> 03:34:15.840]  doj and fbi officials but excluded from the faiza applications doj official bruce or met with steel
[03:34:15.840 --> 03:34:24.000]  beginning in the summer of 2016 and relayed to doj information about steels bias steel told or that he
[03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:29.840]  steel was desperate that donald trump not get elected president and was passionate about him
[03:34:29.840 --> 03:34:35.440]  not becoming president the fbi and justice department mounted a month's long effort to keep
[03:34:35.440 --> 03:34:40.960]  the information outlined in the memo out of the house intelligence committee's hands only the
[03:34:40.960 --> 03:34:47.440]  threat of contempt charges and other forms of pressure forced the fbi justice to give up the
[03:34:47.440 --> 03:34:54.320]  material former fbi director james comey referred to the investigators of the memo as weasels and
[03:34:54.320 --> 03:35:01.440]  liars in a tweet last night the hill reports another document an eight page criminal referral
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:06.400]  filed with the justice department by senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley
[03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:14.160]  and senator lindsay graham is also part of the gop case now americans can decipher why democratic
[03:35:14.160 --> 03:35:19.520]  representative adam schiff did everything he could to not allow its release including claiming
[03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:24.560]  americans wouldn't understand it to the bizarre claim that it was unlawful due to the correction
[03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:29.840]  of typos um so these changes were not made known to the committee when we voted out the document
[03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:35.360]  uh the document that they produced to the white house is evidently not the same one we voted
[03:35:35.360 --> 03:35:41.760]  on uh and it's just another corruption of the process earlier this week schiff had to inform
[03:35:41.760 --> 03:35:48.240]  his minority party that both the fbi and the doj were officially under investigation by the house
[03:35:48.240 --> 03:35:54.240]  intelligence committee the fbi displayed sheer panic as the walls closed in pleading that they
[03:35:54.240 --> 03:36:01.680]  had grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy
[03:36:01.680 --> 03:36:07.680]  house and senate minority leaders nancy polosi and chuck schumer had blood in their eyes for house
[03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:13.040]  intelligence committee chairman devin newness urging speaker of the house paul ryan to immediately
[03:36:13.040 --> 03:36:18.080]  dismiss newness as intel chairman i do believe that the chairman of the intelligence committee
[03:36:18.080 --> 03:36:24.640]  mr newness should be taken out of that office additionally former fbi deputy director andrew
[03:36:24.640 --> 03:36:30.560]  mccabe stepped down amid the memo turmoil mccabe is being investigated by the office of special
[03:36:30.560 --> 03:36:36.720]  counsel on whether mccabe's activities supporting his wife jill's democratic campaign for virginia
[03:36:36.720 --> 03:36:44.720]  state senate in 2015 violated the hatchax prohibition against fbi agents campaigning in partisan races
[03:36:44.720 --> 03:36:50.960]  according to cirka news a glaring example of the arrogance of the top brass assuming they're above
[03:36:50.960 --> 03:36:57.280]  the law and fbi director christ for rey has been under pressure by former fbi pro russian narrative
[03:36:57.280 --> 03:37:03.520]  pushers to step down rey is quietly making the threat to step down on his own accord to be willing
[03:37:04.560 --> 03:37:09.040]  to quit or be fired at a moment's notice in order to stand up for what you think is right
[03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:16.080]  the panic is widespread now americans can pour the drain oh for themselves right into that drain
[03:37:16.080 --> 03:37:24.160]  clogging the swamp john bound reporting for info wars dot com what a fantastic report what a
[03:37:24.160 --> 03:37:31.440]  fantastic report for info wars did you catch all of that the complete look i'll tell you something
[03:37:31.440 --> 03:37:39.760]  um in my capacity as as an investigator for the last 30 years when i looked when i look at that
[03:37:39.760 --> 03:37:46.640]  report and i see all of the moving parts within this isn't that doesn't it amaze you as it amazes
[03:37:46.640 --> 03:37:52.480]  me the fact that that we are told as americans for example that one part saying that that we are too
[03:37:52.480 --> 03:37:58.320]  stupid to understand what's in that memo and of course then of course when that didn't fly too
[03:37:58.320 --> 03:38:04.720]  well they come out and they say hey wait a minute you're giving away sources and methods in this
[03:38:04.720 --> 03:38:11.040]  memo by releasing this memo grave concerns and then you've got christopher rey supposedly one
[03:38:11.040 --> 03:38:15.760]  of the good guys coming out and saying well you know what look i'll step aside but you know i'm
[03:38:15.760 --> 03:38:22.800]  really not on board with this i want to point something out and this was the subject of i
[03:38:22.800 --> 03:38:28.560]  do two radio shows one in the morning and one in my flight or flagship show at night and this is
[03:38:28.560 --> 03:38:36.160]  something i pointed out uh in my morning show the fbi threatened president donald trump
[03:38:36.880 --> 03:38:44.240]  and i know that's that's a pretty broad statement to make but when you take a look at the uh the
[03:38:44.240 --> 03:38:52.400]  subsequent to when this report was completed and sent to the president for his his for him
[03:38:52.400 --> 03:38:57.760]  to sign off and of course they've got five days of easy at five days to sign off and then send it
[03:38:57.760 --> 03:39:03.200]  back to the house during that time period when we pay very close attention and i know alex had
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:09.760]  covered this in in previous programs there was a visit by the fbi agents to president donald trump
[03:39:10.400 --> 03:39:17.280]  the contingent of or not agents but a contingent of brass of the fbi to express their concerns
[03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:22.960]  actually to general kelly the chief of staff to express their concerns over the release of this
[03:39:22.960 --> 03:39:30.720]  memo that's a pretty significant threat combined with what you saw from that excellent report from
[03:39:30.720 --> 03:39:37.040]  info wars um the uh uh christopher ray saying well you know i could step down i'd be really happy
[03:39:37.040 --> 03:39:44.480]  to step down we are watching the uh in at least in my view based on everything that we've seen here
[03:39:44.480 --> 03:39:53.200]  and as as illustrated through that report we're watching this uh this experience soap opera
[03:39:54.080 --> 03:40:03.120]  tragedy play out where you've got a the coup of the one-time palace guard uh a coup that is still
[03:40:03.120 --> 03:40:09.440]  in progress where you have deep state actors still entrenched within the permanent state
[03:40:09.440 --> 03:40:14.640]  the bureaucracy including but not limited to the department of justice in the fbi paying donald
[03:40:14.640 --> 03:40:19.040]  trump's chief of staff making a visit there saying you know what don't release this memo
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:26.640]  what we're seeing i believe from that visit and from the excellent report that we just heard and
[03:40:26.640 --> 03:40:32.080]  saw where we are seeing the pushback the beginning of the pushback and don't forget of course there's
[03:40:32.080 --> 03:40:40.240]  that uh multiple page longer democratic response and of course we know and alex talks about this
[03:40:40.240 --> 03:40:46.240]  and we talk about this this is no longer republican democrat this is deep state versus non-deep state
[03:40:46.240 --> 03:40:52.000]  actors that's what this is all about you you cannot ascribe any deer or after the names of the people
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:59.680]  involved but this is still taking place i i really i can't say this enough i can't stress this enough
[03:40:59.680 --> 03:41:03.840]  and alex has done a great job and then painting this picture along with mr benny and others
[03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:11.520]  this is still going on the palace coup or the coup the deep state coup is still taking place
[03:41:12.400 --> 03:41:19.600]  and i had mentioned right before the break where uh the uh what you recall the reference to the secret
[03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:28.240]  society tongue-in-cheek perhaps some say that reference in the struck page text was that a tongue
[03:41:28.240 --> 03:41:33.920]  in cheek reference and then of course uh ron johnson uh kind of seemingly walking that back
[03:41:33.920 --> 03:41:40.080]  after talking about it but here's the issue and info wars was one of the first to report on this
[03:41:40.080 --> 03:41:47.360]  i was in fact alex uh and i were talking about this back months ago ed kline reported on this
[03:41:47.360 --> 03:41:54.800]  in his book all out war four different branches of the uh four different field offices of the fbi
[03:41:54.800 --> 03:42:02.000]  involved in conducting surveillance of members of the federal bureaucracy uh individuals within
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:08.800]  the federal government meeting at different locations including a church outside of washington
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:15.440]  dc where they gathered to talk about how to best impede the forward progress of
[03:42:17.200 --> 03:42:20.560]  donald trump now think about that let that sink in for a second
[03:42:20.560 --> 03:42:29.680]  you've got the the white hats in the fbi exposing the machinations the nefarious actions
[03:42:29.680 --> 03:42:35.600]  of those embedded in the bureaucracy it's incredible and this is still going on folks

[03:49:45.680 --> 03:49:51.920]  i'll be right before the break we're talking about the report that was shown of course the
[03:49:51.920 --> 03:49:57.200]  democratic response and the fact that uh the report that that that was put together by
[03:49:57.200 --> 03:50:04.240]  enforce a fantastic report about how the even the american people would not understand the
[03:50:04.240 --> 03:50:11.600]  actual memo once released and how we are being talked down to there's a clip from uh jim heims
[03:50:11.600 --> 03:50:15.760]  as a matter of fact there's a 42nd clip if we can play that now that kind of gets into the
[03:50:16.400 --> 03:50:22.800]  claims of the memo as a second rate hit job can we go ahead and play that it's uh it's a series of
[03:50:22.800 --> 03:50:27.200]  unfounded and out of context attacks on the department of justice on the fbi and a number of
[03:50:27.200 --> 03:50:32.320]  individuals by the way most of whom are republicans some of whom are trump appointees accusing them
[03:50:32.320 --> 03:50:36.800]  of bias and you know i'm never a fan you know chairman goodlots said let's let the public know
[03:50:36.800 --> 03:50:41.840]  this is a memo that is based on highly classified information uh the public's not in a position
[03:50:41.840 --> 03:50:46.640]  any more than the committee was anderson we were not afforded the opportunity to review the underlying
[03:50:46.640 --> 03:50:52.240]  intelligence when the memo was presented to us nonetheless this memo is of such low quality
[03:50:52.240 --> 03:50:57.120]  that when it is out there people will very rapidly see that this is just the latest installment of
[03:50:57.120 --> 03:51:04.400]  second rate efforts to uh to impugn the fbi all right that was jim heims talking to anderson cooper
[03:51:04.400 --> 03:51:10.960]  did you note the the uh the condescension in his voice of course uh but also trying to minimize the
[03:51:10.960 --> 03:51:16.960]  fact that this this memo is really it's there's nothing to it nothing to it at all if there's
[03:51:16.960 --> 03:51:22.800]  nothing to it then then why the outcry why the outrage why in fact talk down to us why
[03:51:23.360 --> 03:51:28.880]  make us feel like first of all we're not entitled to it and even if we would be entitled to it
[03:51:28.880 --> 03:51:36.000]  well gee whiz we wouldn't understand it in any way so what this the bottom line here as i wrap up
[03:51:37.040 --> 03:51:42.320]  in this uh guest hosting spot of the bottom line here is what we're seeing obviously
[03:51:42.320 --> 03:51:49.840]  via this document at its face we're seeing that there appears to be at least from my my reading
[03:51:49.840 --> 03:51:57.600]  of this perjury by mr comey this is my viewpoint now this is my assessment there appears to be
[03:51:58.640 --> 03:52:04.160]  well when you look at deputy assistant director of the fbi andrew mccabe he knew of the facts yet
[03:52:04.160 --> 03:52:13.120]  he was too uh yet he too proceeded to uh to engage in the conduct that's outlined in the report
[03:52:13.120 --> 03:52:20.080]  itself in the memo itself and remember folks this is just the first the first of many to come out
[03:52:21.440 --> 03:52:26.800]  the fact that deputy attorney general uh deputy attorney general celly yates appears to have known
[03:52:26.800 --> 03:52:32.560]  this yet she too participated in these acts deputy attorney general rod rosinstein appears to have
[03:52:32.560 --> 03:52:38.240]  also known these facts but yet continued forward think about this the fact in short
[03:52:39.360 --> 03:52:44.400]  at the the absolute highest levels of the fbi and the u.s. department of justice
[03:52:45.520 --> 03:52:53.120]  they're terrifyingly unbelievably corrupt and co-opted by a political ideology that being of
[03:52:53.120 --> 03:52:59.200]  course the the democratic the dnc but most importantly the progressives the ideology
[03:52:59.200 --> 03:53:05.120]  that the progressives now i'd mentioned right before the break about my sources telling me
[03:53:05.120 --> 03:53:09.680]  and of course it'd be it being in the book all out war and of course when i appeared with alex
[03:53:09.680 --> 03:53:15.440]  jones before about these meetings and the reference to secret societies right before the last break
[03:53:16.480 --> 03:53:23.920]  look what we see going on uh what we see outlined in this particular memo it's still going on the
[03:53:23.920 --> 03:53:34.240]  corruption is still going on the the uh this attempt to take over to shred to usurp our
[03:53:34.880 --> 03:53:40.240]  constitution to take take out donald trump take it to to subvert the will of the people
[03:53:40.240 --> 03:53:50.000]  it's still going on if it wasn't would we wouldn't we see more uh heavy-handed uh tactics uh firing
[03:53:50.000 --> 03:53:57.440]  of of individuals within the department of justice within the fbi yet we see uh bruce or
[03:53:57.440 --> 03:54:03.680]  okay demoted still there right where's he at uh how about rosenstein how about all of the others
[03:54:03.680 --> 03:54:09.360]  named herein i want to draw your attention to something else as well uh something that before
[03:54:09.360 --> 03:54:15.600]  i forget i want to mention i've talked about this on my morning show evalyn farkas the assistant
[03:54:15.600 --> 03:54:22.800]  deputy director of the department of defense appeared on msnbc not too long ago now i don't
[03:54:22.800 --> 03:54:27.040]  have the clip here we don't have the clip here to play it but but she had said something extremely
[03:54:27.760 --> 03:54:34.960]  interesting and i think it's important she had said that uh after donald trump won she appeared on
[03:54:34.960 --> 03:54:40.160]  on msnbc i believe it was on march 2nd i'm going from memory now where she had said that she was
[03:54:40.160 --> 03:54:47.280]  very concerned about the donald trump uh transition team and the that the administration finding out
[03:54:47.280 --> 03:54:55.440]  exactly what the previous regime the previous administration did with respect to the um uh
[03:54:55.440 --> 03:55:03.680]  the spying and the illegal wiretapping and how the phrase she was concerned about how them finding
[03:55:03.680 --> 03:55:12.400]  out how how um um how they knew what they knew in other words speaking to the methods of the
[03:55:12.400 --> 03:55:18.080]  surveillance if you can kind of a homework assignment for the viewers and listeners look up
[03:55:19.280 --> 03:55:28.640]  evalyn farkas f a r k a s msnbc from march 2nd i believe it was of 2017 and listen to that that
[03:55:28.640 --> 03:55:34.960]  that's a short clip as a homework assignment and listen to exactly what she says it's incredible
[03:55:34.960 --> 03:55:39.520]  because they have spilled their hand in this and as alex jones talks about and and all of his
[03:55:39.520 --> 03:55:45.440]  excellent reporters talk about and guests talk about we are seeing this play out one of the most
[03:55:45.440 --> 03:55:52.080]  important stories of our lifetime play out right before our very eyes this cannot be understated
[03:55:52.080 --> 03:55:58.480]  understated this memo and as alex jones had talked uh at length about with mr benny and others look
[03:55:58.480 --> 03:56:06.080]  this is just it's not even the tip of the iceberg this is just the the first lob of a uh
[03:56:06.080 --> 03:56:14.080]  of a ball across the net this is just the very first of more to come expect deep state blowback
[03:56:14.080 --> 03:56:22.080]  expect that count on it we need to pray for donald trump we need to keep him in our prayers we need
[03:56:22.080 --> 03:56:27.600]  to keep him in our thoughts and we need to support him because this is not just about donald trump
[03:56:28.080 --> 03:56:32.800]  it's much bigger than that it's about each and every one of us it's about the rule of law it's
[03:56:32.800 --> 03:56:39.760]  about the constitution but it's kind of wrapping up with with respect to the memo the three and a
[03:56:39.760 --> 03:56:46.640]  quarter page three and a half page whatever we're going to call it memo the current deputy attorney
[03:56:46.640 --> 03:56:51.920]  general rod rosinstein knowing the allegations about the russian collusion knowing that they're
[03:56:51.920 --> 03:56:59.600]  fraudulent think about this still appointed meuller robert s meuller the third as special counsel
[03:57:00.240 --> 03:57:06.080]  knowing everything and this of course to investigate the trump administration for russia for russian
[03:57:06.080 --> 03:57:14.880]  for russian collusion he knew that never took place the whole investigation is based on a fraud
[03:57:14.880 --> 03:57:23.520]  this is based on a sting operation that's exactly what it is an attempt to sting donald trump and
[03:57:23.520 --> 03:57:29.520]  by and by extension each and every one of us folks you're listening to the you're listening to info
