[00:31.960 --> 00:39.580]  fight to defend human liberty worldwide as open hardcore textbook tyranny
[00:39.580 --> 00:45.540]  unfolds on a global scale the United States is at the heart of that battle
[00:45.540 --> 00:53.060]  great evil but also great good resides in this nation as it does in every other
[00:53.060 --> 01:00.340]  corner of the world but the United States is is the hotbed it is where the
[01:00.340 --> 01:06.140]  great struggle is centered we're gonna be live here for the next three hours
[01:06.140 --> 01:13.700]  constitutional scholar pastor patriot former presidential candidate Chuck
[01:13.700 --> 01:18.380]  Baldwin is going to be joining us to talk about the NDAA the increasing
[01:18.380 --> 01:22.100]  tyranny the announcements that US citizens will be tortured killed and
[01:22.100 --> 01:26.940]  disappeared here in the United States the announcements that the United Nations
[01:26.940 --> 01:31.100]  now openly rules the United States through their puppet president the
[01:31.100 --> 01:35.580]  Pentagon has lined up and sworn allegiance to the UN and openly stated
[01:35.580 --> 01:42.420]  Congress has no authority absolute in-your-face declaration of sedition
[01:42.420 --> 01:47.700]  and warfare against the Republic and those words aren't even strong enough
[01:47.700 --> 01:52.860]  understand that's not rhetoric that is the US code the Constitution Bill of
[01:52.860 --> 01:57.300]  Rights Declaration of Independence global precedent for thousands of years
[01:57.300 --> 02:05.900]  right back to the Rubicon in BC 49 with Julius Caesar how does encyclopedia
[02:05.900 --> 02:10.740]  Britannica describe it that guys print me that crossing the Rubicon again is that
[02:10.740 --> 02:14.460]  whole print out from Britannica and Wikipedia just quotes Britannica in
[02:14.460 --> 02:18.180]  that section I was reading where it said when he brought his military in and
[02:18.180 --> 02:25.580]  declared himself the ruler he declared war on the Roman Republic and there was
[02:25.580 --> 02:32.660]  a civil war and he was successful and became Caesar or king translates really
[02:32.660 --> 02:38.820]  to elephant Caesar Kaiser means elephant and elephants were seen as the symbol of
[02:38.820 --> 02:44.700]  royalty thousands of years ago so it translates into that and you saw what
[02:44.700 --> 02:50.260]  happened corruption began to pour in and a lot of people say okay yeah we are
[02:50.260 --> 02:53.740]  going into authoritarian system Congress is becoming ceremonial just as the
[02:53.740 --> 02:56.540]  Roman Senate did what's the big deal well they're gonna take most people's
[02:56.540 --> 03:00.860]  property they're gonna conscript your children for warfare the police are
[03:00.860 --> 03:05.020]  fully militarized against this hurt was showing me video and news articles all

[06:00.660 --> 06:05.380]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[06:05.380 --> 06:08.940]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[06:08.940 --> 06:13.020]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[06:13.020 --> 06:16.460]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[06:16.460 --> 06:21.200]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[08:00.580 --> 08:09.100]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:18.140 --> 08:28.180]  this is gonna be an incredibly important live Friday radio show it is 11 a.m.
[08:28.180 --> 08:34.900]  in eight minutes central standard time thank you so much for joining us
[08:34.900 --> 08:41.100]  unfortunately our deep analysis of the last 17 years of the global corporate
[08:41.100 --> 08:47.860]  fascist neural water structure has been absolutely accurate except in one facet
[08:47.860 --> 08:52.620]  it's one thing to forecast and see their own battle plans much of which are
[08:52.620 --> 08:59.940]  public is another thing entirely to actually see it unfolding it is so many
[08:59.940 --> 09:07.260]  more nightmarish facets it is so much more aggressive and fast-growing and
[09:07.260 --> 09:14.100]  openly attacking everything that is good and wholesome because that can always
[09:14.100 --> 09:19.380]  be a a center of resistance to evil so it's it's going after everything wholesome
[09:19.380 --> 09:23.660]  everything good everything natural overturning the existing order of
[09:23.660 --> 09:28.180]  creation with genetic engineering chemical biological weapons endless war
[09:28.180 --> 09:33.460]  bondage death slavery propaganda constantly that the tyrant global
[09:33.460 --> 09:38.380]  corporate government is loving and good and it wants to help everybody it it
[09:38.380 --> 09:42.980]  literally dumbs down populations manipulates good people into serving
[09:42.980 --> 09:49.540]  evil attacks the family the nation-state the family farm everything it is
[09:49.540 --> 09:59.500]  unmitigated pure pit of hell evil because you see in history corrupt forces
[09:59.500 --> 10:04.980]  compete with each other for the power for the ring of sword on and only the
[10:04.980 --> 10:11.900]  most cunning only the most given over to absolute pure ruthlessness and beyond
[10:11.900 --> 10:17.540]  ruthlessness and enjoyment of pain suffering humiliation death poverty
[10:17.540 --> 10:23.340]  humiliation trampling humanity being trampled upon pressing on the nerve of
[10:23.340 --> 10:29.900]  power the priest of power the priest of abomination desolation and the great
[10:29.900 --> 10:36.860]  hell that they're conjuring governments killed 262 mil not counting military
[10:36.860 --> 10:42.740]  casualties in the 20th century and they are preparing to engage in mega death
[10:42.740 --> 10:48.500]  upon mega death mega death to the power of infinity because they will kill and
[10:48.500 --> 10:52.820]  kill and kill and only allow small amounts of life to continue so it can be
[10:52.820 --> 10:57.900]  killed I don't know if killing a million is a mega death what is what is killing a
[10:57.900 --> 11:02.500]  billion that maybe search that if a mega death is over a million what is a
[11:02.500 --> 11:06.820]  billion because the globalists all openly say from Bill Gates to Ted Turner to
[11:06.820 --> 11:13.240]  the UN they want world government to carry out an orderly extermination but
[11:13.240 --> 11:19.180]  then Bill Gates is funding Coney 2012 this fake grassroots movement about
[11:19.180 --> 11:24.380]  invading Africa to save some children from some warlord who might have 500
[11:24.380 --> 11:29.500]  soldiers under a man has if he has committed crimes it's a micron of the
[11:29.500 --> 11:34.100]  president of Uganda and others who've been involved in the decades of genocide
[11:34.100 --> 11:40.060]  that's gone on and now they've got George Clooney and everyone yes in vade war
[11:40.060 --> 11:47.220]  Africans in place in Uganda in Kenya in other areas in now the area they've
[11:47.220 --> 11:51.660]  bombed out and and leveled of Libya the genocides now starting there and it'll
[11:51.660 --> 11:54.980]  be millions and millions killed and then they'll say all the UN didn't know this
[11:54.980 --> 11:58.740]  was happening and all the trendies will still feel good about themselves I've
[11:58.740 --> 12:01.980]  run to these trendy liberals they're not liberals these are scientific
[12:01.980 --> 12:06.260]  exterminist who know exactly what they're doing with their camp followers
[12:06.260 --> 12:09.460]  and they'll look at you and lick their lips and their eyes will gleam they're
[12:09.460 --> 12:13.380]  like you're not gonna stop us I've run into a many times I've said I know your
[12:13.380 --> 12:16.740]  foundation run this isn't about peace they're like you won't stop us and then
[12:16.740 --> 12:20.580]  another little trendy comes over the actual friendly oh hi I'm liberal oh and
[12:20.580 --> 12:23.940]  start talking to each other like that but behind the scenes they're just like
[12:23.940 --> 12:29.260]  I mean that's who Bill Gates and all of them are George Clooney all of it it's
[12:29.260 --> 12:37.780]  just like but it's all in the service like I'm non-threatening you understand
[12:37.780 --> 12:43.140]  that and they mean business now I can't read George Clooney's heart and these
[12:43.140 --> 12:50.740]  other people but I know either their complete useful idiot morons or they
[12:50.740 --> 12:53.660]  are consciously part of this and I've run into many of these globalists and
[12:53.660 --> 12:58.100]  their minions where they are conscious of it you I mean you didn't think a
[12:58.100 --> 13:05.180]  hardcore tyrant and and and and their coterie and squadrons and armies and
[13:05.180 --> 13:13.100]  gaggles of servant minions actually you're gonna run around wearing black
[13:13.100 --> 13:20.460]  uniforms and skull caps like the Nazis did did you know they're gonna walk
[13:20.460 --> 13:29.140]  around with with limp wrist acting foppishly but that's all they're covered
[13:29.140 --> 13:35.820]  because behind them is stealth bombers tanks special forces biochemical weapons
[13:35.820 --> 13:40.500]  giga death giga death is what it's called so a billion or more so they want
[13:40.500 --> 13:46.260]  they want giga death times six they want six billion dead at least
[13:46.260 --> 13:54.140]  conservatively six giga death and of course they're telling their upper
[13:54.140 --> 13:57.260]  level minions oh there'll be a billion left or maybe 250 million we're not
[13:57.260 --> 14:02.260]  sure you know they debate those numbers in different prospectus plans but if you
[14:02.260 --> 14:05.820]  really read their deeper plans that we've covered here it's like no we may
[14:05.820 --> 14:10.300]  allow a few thousand to live and then they'll be served by the robotic systems
[14:10.300 --> 14:14.260]  and get on their little space planes and oh I think I'll go to the ruins of
[14:14.260 --> 14:18.940]  Tokyo today or they'll go to their off-world bases I'm not saying any of
[14:18.940 --> 14:25.100]  this is actually gonna happen this is what the elite all talk about 24 7 all
[14:25.100 --> 14:29.180]  they have private transport jets landing behind them full of servants and
[14:29.180 --> 14:38.300]  chefs and people with all the organic certified food grown on their farms on
[14:38.300 --> 14:41.580]  record I've shown you all those articles because they wouldn't eat what they feed
[14:41.580 --> 14:45.380]  us for any amount of money because they're running chemical biological
[14:45.380 --> 14:51.220]  warfare ops on us you understand and that's why all of you the thing you're
[14:51.220 --> 14:55.100]  gonna win serving evil all of you out there that get off on serving the evil
[14:55.100 --> 15:06.540]  go ahead go ahead because you will be judged by your own masters they are
[15:06.540 --> 15:10.980]  gonna tear you limb from limb you're gonna wish you were torn limb from limb
[15:10.980 --> 15:16.220]  like some horror movie as you die under their chemical and biological warfare
[15:16.220 --> 15:20.620]  slow deaths the globalists love slow death they love killing you slow with
[15:20.620 --> 15:25.980]  their treatments once you go into them and all the blind masses serving them
[15:25.980 --> 15:34.820]  you want hell you got it so go ahead don't choose good call me a lion cook
[15:34.820 --> 15:40.220]  call the truth a lie right in its face but don't say you weren't warned because
[15:40.220 --> 15:45.380]  there's a universal spiritual metaphysical rule that you must be given
[15:45.380 --> 15:51.900]  the choice you must be told the truth you must be told the way out so you can
[15:51.900 --> 16:03.940]  then deny it before God turns you over to what you love I have a lot of anger
[16:03.940 --> 16:07.940]  because I love the beauty of this planet I love my family I love my life and I am
[16:07.940 --> 16:13.940]  angry that I'm right and that all of this is just gonna continue to rot and
[16:13.940 --> 16:19.100]  that we're gonna look back on today as I said a year ago you're gonna look back
[16:19.100 --> 16:24.180]  on the present time and everything before it as the good old times even if
[16:24.180 --> 16:30.340]  you thought times were bad you have seen nothing if they're able to abolish the
[16:30.340 --> 16:33.180]  Bill of Rights and Constitution incrementally they would then start doing
[16:33.180 --> 16:38.220]  it in big ways and now the FBI director went before Congress and said I don't
[16:38.220 --> 16:41.220]  know if the president can kill Americans without trial or arrest here
[16:41.220 --> 16:45.260]  because the president claims that power he just wouldn't say it and they're
[16:45.260 --> 16:49.060]  like but but you're you're not allowed to do that you know the the president
[16:49.060 --> 16:53.180]  wanted these powers that says he won't use them Congress treasonously gave the
[16:53.180 --> 17:01.820]  president the dictatorial power he demanded and now Congress is angry that
[17:01.820 --> 17:07.180]  he sent his emissaries his henchmen in there the generals the joint chiefs the
[17:07.180 --> 17:13.340]  chairman and the traitorous treacherous foreign banker asset Panetta to tell
[17:13.340 --> 17:20.020]  them repeatedly over and over again no senators we do not get authority from
[17:20.020 --> 17:25.020]  war for him you and the senators are like are you saying the president can act
[17:25.020 --> 17:28.780]  alone that's not in the Constitution that's illegal they go no he acts under
[17:28.780 --> 17:33.660]  the UN and NATO and the senators start saying I I'm losing my breath I'm having
[17:33.660 --> 17:36.820]  you can tell they're actually having adrenaline rushes they're like you're
[17:36.820 --> 17:43.540]  saying we're and they're like you're you're nothing you're nothing read PDD 51
[17:43.540 --> 17:47.020]  just the synopsis that was declassified they won't release the full text but the
[17:47.020 --> 17:50.820]  synopsis three pages says Congress can be completely suspended the president
[17:50.820 --> 17:54.820]  for any emergency including an undeclared one or a secret emergency or
[17:54.820 --> 18:00.740]  economic emergency suspends everything in his absolute ruler and that president
[18:00.740 --> 18:05.740]  and that office serves the United Nations and the globalist let me show
[18:05.740 --> 18:11.340]  you something here that we can put this on screen this is time magazine last
[18:11.340 --> 18:17.220]  November what does it say right here regime change in Europe to Greece and

[24:15.060 --> 24:19.140]  world hundreds of establishment publications are now promoting the
[24:19.140 --> 24:23.300]  idea that secret arrest is good that foreign private banks running our
[24:23.300 --> 24:27.260]  countries and even our towns and cities as they go bankrupt it's openly being
[24:27.260 --> 24:32.020]  announced as good that we will be conscripted into corporate work brigades
[24:32.020 --> 24:36.620]  on top of our taxes once things fully collapse now that's being prepared
[24:36.620 --> 24:40.700]  through the governor's council and is in executive orders that just type in

[24:43.780 --> 24:47.980]  White House dot gov there's a whole bunch of different concurrent resolutions on
[24:47.980 --> 24:52.820]  that and the police are going to show up just like in Russia or China and say
[24:52.820 --> 24:59.140]  come help build roads ditches on top of your other jobs on top of everything and
[24:59.140 --> 25:01.860]  of course if you're homeless they'll just send you to a FEMA camp but you'll
[25:01.860 --> 25:05.340]  have to work there and the government admitted in the emergency centers
[25:05.340 --> 25:09.620]  establishment act that you will work at the civilian and mate labor camp even if
[25:09.620 --> 25:17.020]  you are you know not convicted of a crime because you got to pay for your
[25:17.020 --> 25:22.340]  keep and that's the new America and all the control freaks all the nobodies all
[25:22.340 --> 25:24.940]  the people that couldn't get a job all the folks that want to be bullies
[25:24.940 --> 25:32.060]  they're gonna work for Homeland Security and rape our wives and beat us up and
[25:32.060 --> 25:36.180]  kill us and forcibly inoculate us this is what happens in every country and
[25:36.180 --> 25:39.780]  they're planning in here and they're training them for it hell is being
[25:39.780 --> 25:42.780]  prepared for this country and just incrementally they're just gonna get
[25:42.780 --> 25:49.180]  everybody ready for it or we could wake up and say no to this and the good news
[25:49.180 --> 25:53.980]  is I've told everybody that when they come to this point of open martial law
[25:53.980 --> 25:58.860]  open tyranny open secret arrest open disappearances of people with bags over
[25:58.860 --> 26:05.700]  their heads that if the Congress and if the state say no and call the occupied
[26:05.700 --> 26:11.260]  federal governments run by foreign banks publicly call their bluff I mean let
[26:11.260 --> 26:16.860]  the TSA and the feds put f-16s in the air and say no no air traffic to Texas go
[26:16.860 --> 26:22.540]  ahead and let that unfold you know you heard military officers calling
[26:22.540 --> 26:25.660]  yesterday and this is in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act 07 so I
[26:25.660 --> 26:28.900]  don't need to hear it from them but it was good to hear the inside I didn't
[26:28.900 --> 26:32.620]  just believe the callers I already knew it but he said yeah when Perry made the
[26:32.620 --> 26:37.980]  comment about Texas's secession which was just for political rhetoric gain with
[26:37.980 --> 26:42.100]  constituents that are awake to the Tenth Amendment they put the National Guard
[26:42.100 --> 26:46.660]  in all the states around Texas on alert prepared them and got their armored
[26:46.660 --> 26:55.460]  vehicles and tanks ready to invade the state of Texas that's what's going on
[26:55.460 --> 27:00.580]  here the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says insurrection civil
[27:00.580 --> 27:05.420]  unrest insurrection in the states and by legislatures and governors and then it
[27:05.420 --> 27:09.300]  says real dryly in there if there's a problem I read it on air many times you
[27:09.300 --> 27:16.420]  can go look it up with governors replacing governors you know that happened
[27:16.420 --> 27:21.820]  twice here in Texas during reconstruction Texas ran to appointed
[27:21.820 --> 27:30.340]  northern governors out of the Capitol in gun battles at the Texas Capitol so see
[27:30.340 --> 27:32.980]  the globalists have done this in a lot of other countries they've done this
[27:32.980 --> 27:38.940]  here and they know they know so the the Pentagon North com is aimed at the
[27:38.940 --> 27:43.260]  states publicly it's all there
[27:46.620 --> 27:51.300]  so it's time for people to understand that in the old days the central
[27:51.300 --> 27:57.620]  government will just roll in and say we're the central government in the
[27:57.620 --> 28:01.460]  modern times the central government's run by foreign assets foreign
[28:01.460 --> 28:05.820]  corporations it will stage terror attacks to make the federal government fed
[28:05.820 --> 28:12.300]  gov which is just the receivership arm of the bankers look like the victim just
[28:12.300 --> 28:18.340]  like Oklahoma City just like 9-11 all of it 9-11 was a pretext to fully
[28:18.340 --> 28:22.620]  enslave this country and turn into an engine of global domination and the
[28:22.620 --> 28:26.620]  globalists want to overthrow every existing form they state they want to
[28:26.620 --> 28:30.540]  post-industrial world they want all the shops out of business the movie theaters

[36:22.140 --> 36:25.660]  that love to murder people you know why because good people don't stand up to
[36:25.660 --> 36:30.540]  them humans have a pre-designed system to give into authority so authorities
[36:30.540 --> 36:38.980]  were crowns big uniforms badges and we bend over and lick their boots and
[36:38.980 --> 36:42.540]  government publicly says it's setting up a global government to kill
[36:42.540 --> 36:47.900]  everybody for the new world order global government is just the beginning
[36:47.900 --> 36:53.260]  once it's in place everything that they have been beta testing will come to
[36:53.260 --> 36:57.460]  fruition here it is wired magazine uncle Sam if it ends in a calm it's
[36:57.460 --> 37:04.300]  feasible even in foreign countries when US authorities not servants shuttered
[37:04.300 --> 37:12.060]  sports wearing sight wagering site VOD dog bow dog last week it raised eyebrows
[37:12.060 --> 37:15.540]  across the net because the domain name was registered in Canaanadian company
[37:15.540 --> 37:19.100]  ostensibly putting it beyond the reach of US government working around that the
[37:19.100 --> 37:23.020]  feds went directly to Verisign a US based internet backbone who do you think
[37:23.020 --> 37:30.500]  set up the web the Pentagon they gave it to Verisign and it goes on contracted to
[37:30.500 --> 37:34.660]  manage the coveted.com yeah they say under that it's under the commerce
[37:34.660 --> 37:38.500]  clause just because it says calm that was always the plan and other generic
[37:38.500 --> 37:45.420]  top-level domains easy DNS internet infrastructure company protests of the
[37:45.420 --> 37:49.220]  ramifications of this are no less than chilling every single organization
[37:49.220 --> 37:55.540]  branded or operating under calm net org biz etc and the feds go on to say we
[37:55.540 --> 38:01.740]  will take any website anytime we want period okay I mean folks that there are
[38:01.740 --> 38:06.180]  cases every week now where they go grab giant internet service provider
[38:06.180 --> 38:09.980]  companies in some cases that one case they had over a million websites
[38:09.980 --> 38:17.420]  thousands and thousands of customers one gambling site that just let people go
[38:17.420 --> 38:21.860]  find legal gambling sites it was like an index like a yellow pages shut it down
[38:21.860 --> 38:27.700]  they had a the fed sees a whole internet service provider company because there
[38:27.700 --> 38:33.220]  was one site with a message board and somebody linked to a song you could
[38:33.220 --> 38:40.060]  download and they took tens of thousands of domains it was hotels domains
[38:40.060 --> 38:46.420]  racetracks restaurants dentist and the feds just said it's all ours we don't
[38:46.420 --> 38:49.660]  it's and you're like well that's crazy well what why would they want to
[38:49.660 --> 38:53.820]  discredit themselves no they're teaching you they're gonna do what they want
[38:53.820 --> 38:58.700]  they've got picked federal juries 98% conviction rates they're shipping
[38:58.700 --> 39:03.700]  narcotics in and they can't say no now to the feds that want to kidnap kids and
[39:03.700 --> 39:08.140]  make money off of it see once they're all corrupt it sinks to the bottom because
[39:08.140 --> 39:12.060]  then nobody can say no to anybody else and so the most horrible stuff you can
[39:12.060 --> 39:22.220]  imagine is now the norm and it all starts with prohibition and cops and the
[39:22.220 --> 39:30.140]  FBI being paid off by gangsters to let liquor be sold illegally and the once
[39:30.140 --> 39:35.260]  they got a taste of that money and being high rollers it was over once Jagger
[39:35.260 --> 39:38.860]  Hoover on record could go to the racetrack every time and always win on
[39:38.860 --> 39:43.420]  the ponies as his little payoff that's a big way politicians have been paid off
[39:43.420 --> 39:48.620]  for more than a hundred years you go to the racetrack and you'll win every time
[39:48.620 --> 39:53.100]  Hillary Clinton puts a couple thousand dollars in on cattle futures makes you
[39:53.100 --> 39:56.620]  know a hundreds of times what she invested she didn't really win the
[39:56.620 --> 40:01.060]  cattle futures she just was giving it and Congress gets caught in satyr's
[40:01.060 --> 40:09.900]  rating they just say well we say it's legal of course it's not legal okay I've
[40:09.900 --> 40:13.540]  been ranting here I am so wound up I've got Chuck Baldwin coming up and I want
[40:13.540 --> 40:17.380]  to get him on but I feel like I should open the phones up to the military again
[40:17.380 --> 40:20.420]  we've got our weekly visit with Bob Chapman coming up but I haven't even I
[40:20.420 --> 40:24.260]  did hours and hours of research and preparation this morning at home and I
[40:24.260 --> 40:27.460]  get in here ready to put on a huge presentation of information and just
[40:27.460 --> 40:33.300]  start ranting at you desperately trying to get people to wake up
[40:37.100 --> 40:42.780]  let me just restart right here okay two days ago as you know we've linked to
[40:42.780 --> 40:51.420]  the video and the audio I played it on the nightly news last night of Secretary
[40:51.420 --> 40:57.100]  Defense Panetta chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the chairman telling the
[40:57.100 --> 41:01.820]  Senate committee that we don't come to you to launch wars now we go to the UN so
[41:01.820 --> 41:07.740]  not only is the president they're saying a dictator that's the essence of it in
[41:07.740 --> 41:12.460]  in mainline history mainline jurisprudence that this is what's taught 101
[41:12.460 --> 41:20.660]  in law school okay this is this is 101 this is the royal flush of tyranny but
[41:20.660 --> 41:25.700]  they went one further not only are they saying the president's a dictator which
[41:25.700 --> 41:29.780]  is total treason high treason high crime and legislation's been introduced to
[41:29.780 --> 41:34.140]  begin impeachment saying it's a high crime and quote in the Constitution a high
[41:34.140 --> 41:41.980]  crime folks that's punishable by we'll go read the statute the new world order
[41:41.980 --> 41:52.100]  will not be outdone by Caesar or by Hitler no sir no sir they've got to go
[41:52.100 --> 41:57.420]  further they say we don't say the presidency has this power we get it
[41:57.420 --> 42:00.500]  from the UN in NATO and I've played the clip over and over again you can go
[42:00.500 --> 42:05.300]  watch it it's in the article coup d'etat coup d'etat Pentagon and Obama
[42:05.300 --> 42:10.780]  declare Congress ceremonial they pretty much abolished Congress you know
[42:10.780 --> 42:16.740]  Caesar kept the Senate around kind of was like a think tank you know he'd hear
[42:16.740 --> 42:23.180]  what they had to say but he had the final word I mean history repeats itself
[42:23.180 --> 42:26.980]  this didn't just happen in Rome it's happened over and over and over and over
[42:26.980 --> 42:30.180]  and over again so I thought I would explain everybody exactly what's
[42:30.180 --> 42:34.780]  happening here the exact same development is happening in Europe they get the
[42:34.780 --> 42:39.380]  countries to sign on to the bureaucracy the EU then the bureaucracy gets the
[42:39.380 --> 42:43.580]  traitorous people that they financed into politics in every country in the EU
[42:43.580 --> 42:48.580]  France Germany all of them to sign over national sovereignty and treaties to the
[42:48.580 --> 42:54.820]  new private banking arm you know it is a g20 then the g20 has their operatives
[42:54.820 --> 42:59.380]  all former Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Bank of England on record and Bundesbank
[42:59.380 --> 43:04.780]  sign on to 1.5 quadrillion we've been signed on as well just made up like I
[43:04.780 --> 43:08.900]  put 1.5 quadrillion in a computer I have the politicians sign on to the debt I
[43:08.900 --> 43:12.100]  have the corporate whore media I own as a globalist banker as a Rothschild
[43:12.100 --> 43:17.620]  Rockefeller type say that it's our debt and that we owe it the public's not
[43:17.620 --> 43:23.180]  paying attention then I raise taxes cut benefits to put the economy into free
[43:23.180 --> 43:28.220]  fall so that when things go into total depression I can come in with the tens of
[43:28.220 --> 43:33.020]  trillions I've just gotten in bailout and buy everything up but I never use the
[43:33.020 --> 43:37.820]  money to sure up the derivatives I keep growing those and telling folks too big
[43:37.820 --> 43:41.660]  to fail so you go down with the ship I go down with the ship but the bankers
[43:41.660 --> 43:43.940]  come out dominating and here's time magazine
[43:43.940 --> 43:47.700]  regime change in Europe do Greece and Italy amount to a bankers to and they
[43:47.700 --> 43:51.140]  going to say it is a bankers to but it's a good thing the bankers know how to fix
[43:51.140 --> 43:57.020]  it because they did it here's another one banker coup Goldman Sachs takes over
[43:57.020 --> 44:01.060]  Europe other mainstream articles you can go read all of this okay
[44:01.060 --> 44:09.860]  Banker could time magazine now the exact same banks that run Amarala locky and
[44:09.860 --> 44:16.220]  all the rest of these globalist all the rest of these New World Order trash
[44:19.460 --> 44:24.500]  they are now going before Congress and saying you have no authority you run
[44:24.500 --> 44:32.780]  nothing you are nothing and the Congress is getting angry but you see the CIA
[44:32.780 --> 44:38.100]  that represents the foreign banks the foreign corporate takeover occupation
[44:38.100 --> 44:42.980]  this is a literal banker occupation on record they call it that themselves at
[44:42.980 --> 44:46.420]  Davos never wear it I mean they think it's very funny this is very funny to
[44:46.420 --> 44:49.300]  them I have a Reuters article that I didn't make a big enough deal about
[44:49.300 --> 44:53.900]  yesterday where they say we're modeling this after the NDA of America we will
[44:53.900 --> 44:58.500]  now secretly arrest whoever we want and disappear them and kill them and our own
[44:58.500 --> 45:02.340]  State Department's not criticizing it because now the Communist Chinese are
[45:02.340 --> 45:05.780]  getting aid and comfort from their globalist partners that run our country
[45:05.780 --> 45:09.220]  because the bankers have invested and set tax laws to move everything to China
[45:09.220 --> 45:15.260]  that they've made a deal with China is now rolling back reforms and saying yeah
[45:15.260 --> 45:20.620]  we'll secretly arrest in the past they didn't put it on paper they just did it
[45:20.620 --> 45:26.300]  you think your pensions safe you think your children are safe you think your
[45:26.300 --> 45:30.620]  culture is safe when the government's run by people that openly say they'll
[45:30.620 --> 45:35.260]  kill citizens secretly or kidnap you and put a bag over your head so they can
[45:35.260 --> 45:39.580]  now go into black op grips and private corporations and mercenaries and tell
[45:39.580 --> 45:44.740]  them go kill Andrew Breitbart go kill Alex Jones go kill Matt Grudge go kill
[45:44.740 --> 45:54.020]  whoever go kill the DC madam you understand they wouldn't be openly
[45:54.020 --> 45:57.820]  pushing torture like they did 10 years ago they weren't gonna try to deploy it
[45:57.820 --> 46:01.380]  and sell it and they did they're not pushing secretly killing citizens
[46:01.380 --> 46:04.220]  because they just want to come out and do that they're doing that because it's
[46:04.220 --> 46:09.140]  already going on it's already going on it's been going on a long time but they
[46:09.140 --> 46:13.900]  don't want to be blackmailed with it they want it legal even though you can't
[46:13.900 --> 46:19.380]  legalize crime those laws are null and void and then passing these laws is the
[46:19.380 --> 46:25.460]  total conviction proof in their own words of their criminality and treason and
[46:25.460 --> 46:32.020]  the fact that they're a danger but we're all in grave danger all of us are in
[46:32.020 --> 46:37.540]  grave danger if you're not getting chills ladies and gentlemen if you aren't
[46:37.540 --> 46:42.580]  absolutely burning with a desire to get fully informed on this and inform others
[46:42.580 --> 46:47.980]  and resist it and if you're not preparing to resist this by every means
[46:47.980 --> 46:53.300]  necessary in the info war and to defend yourself by every means including
[46:53.300 --> 46:57.980]  physical which is your ancient right then you're not living in reality or if
[46:57.980 --> 47:03.180]  you're scared then you better join this and serve evil which you'll be destroyed
[47:03.180 --> 47:09.300]  guaranteed by them or you can run but you can't hide this is a world government
[47:09.300 --> 47:14.220]  you have been warned you have been told you have been put on record I am here in
[47:14.220 --> 47:20.020]  the face going head up directly against the most evil system the world has ever
[47:20.020 --> 47:26.580]  seen because it's uncloking itself now and my power and my prestige is going
[47:26.580 --> 47:32.300]  to rise as everything I've talked about unfolds and as I directly challenge
[47:32.300 --> 47:39.620]  them and you're like oh great an ego maniac no the opposite no it's the
[47:39.620 --> 47:48.580]  opposite as I do my duty and rise up against this that is when I enter the
[47:48.580 --> 47:53.300]  maximum danger those of you out there on average you fight this tyranny you are
[47:53.300 --> 47:56.060]  in much greater danger not speaking out against it because it'll come into
[47:56.060 --> 47:59.540]  fruition and target everyone it targets everyone people say well what do I have
[47:59.540 --> 48:03.860]  to hide I don't care if they're sitting up tyranny I'm just gonna go along with
[48:03.860 --> 48:07.740]  it they want to feed on you they want to bully you they want to cut your wages
[48:07.740 --> 48:10.580]  they want to take everything you've got they want to euthanize you when you're
[48:10.580 --> 48:18.900]  old Bill Gates has said it don't you understand that don't you get that
[48:23.180 --> 48:28.460]  history is happening right now do you hear it you hear it in the silence you
[48:28.460 --> 48:32.500]  hear the clash of arms across the world you hear the young the children being
[48:32.500 --> 48:37.100]  persecuted the million dead Iraqis the 40 plus thousand dead Libyans the Al Qaeda
[48:37.100 --> 48:40.540]  forces slaughtering them in mass as we speak and it's all admitted but it's
[48:40.540 --> 48:44.620]  humanitarian and liberal so it's good the 51 million aborted babies now they
[48:44.620 --> 48:51.500]  say kill living babies now they say kill grandma on the cover of Newsweek they
[48:51.500 --> 48:55.780]  openly man cow sent me a mainstream news articles where universities are now
[48:55.780 --> 49:00.020]  promoting the legalization of pedophilia and having group meetings pushing and I
[49:00.020 --> 49:03.300]  mean it's just and then you understand we're the ones that are going to be
[49:03.300 --> 49:09.100]  persecuted because we're not turned over to evil you know do you get that when
[49:09.100 --> 49:12.580]  wickedness takes over it doesn't just go after the good it goes after everything
[49:12.580 --> 49:16.140]  because that's its nature
[49:20.580 --> 49:25.740]  I'm calling all of those who want to stand for liberty and justice I'm calling
[49:25.740 --> 49:38.140]  for everyone out there who loves freedom to really think about which side you're
[49:38.140 --> 49:41.860]  going to be on because that's what's important make a decision what side
[49:41.860 --> 49:46.940]  you're on and then put it into action but the decision is the most important
[49:46.940 --> 49:51.180]  point and you know what your heart and your soul wants you want to make the
[49:51.180 --> 49:56.540]  decision to fight evil but your flesh is afraid go through that fear and find
[49:56.540 --> 50:01.620]  your humanity step across on faith and say God I don't know what's going to
[50:01.620 --> 50:07.100]  happen to me and I'm not worried about that whatever your will is just use me
[50:07.100 --> 50:11.940]  as an instrument against this darkness to defend the innocent now I have some
[50:11.940 --> 50:15.780]  really good news when we come back from break the legislation in the Senate and
[50:15.780 --> 50:20.580]  the House is picking up steam very quickly to begin impeachment proceedings
[50:20.580 --> 50:25.420]  against President Obama if he does not immediately seek congressional approval
[50:25.420 --> 50:30.980]  for all military actions that are unauthorized and so now this issue
[50:30.980 --> 50:35.020]  starting to come to a head and this is good the enemy is testing us right now
[50:35.020 --> 50:40.220]  to see if they can fully engage in a public coup over this republic and
[50:40.220 --> 50:44.780]  over Congress now I'm gonna give you the number to the Judiciary Committee to
[50:44.780 --> 50:48.380]  begin impeachment proceedings and the general number to promote the piece of
[50:48.380 --> 50:54.700]  legislation with the legislation number introduced in the House by Walter Jones
[50:54.700 --> 51:00.700]  of North Carolina we're gonna fight back against this wickedness straight ahead
[51:00.700 --> 51:06.220]  folks Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices
[51:06.220 --> 51:10.060]  whether you're struggling with food costs which are being blown up by gas
[51:10.060 --> 51:14.740]  costs now or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes whatever food
[51:14.740 --> 51:19.540]  supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand e-foods direct

[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:41.220]  well it's really a opportune time a fortuitous time to get pastor chuck
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:48.340]  Baldwin on who of course also ran for president back in 08 on the
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:54.180]  Constitution Party it's a good time to get him on because we have decisions to
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:58.460]  make in this country who we're gonna serve God the Constitution Bill of
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:03.380]  Rights Declaration of Independence common sense our heritage or this global
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:08.300]  corporate fascist crony capitalist anti-free market New World Order the
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:13.020]  book is Romans 13 the true meaning of submission second edition Timothy
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:19.180]  Baldwin and Chuck balding wrote it with his son and it is a excellent books it's
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:24.300]  only 144 pages long and breaks down with the scriptures of course I've read a lot
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:28.140]  of the Bible so I know I mean the whole Bible is about people standing up against
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:32.260]  corrupt governments and rebuking them and many times being killed so the
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:37.980]  misinterpretation of Romans 13 saying what was Hitler's favorite verse Stalin
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:41.820]  used it to with Christians in Ukraine you know God says submit to government
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:47.340]  well that's not what it really says Christ and others are saying give to God
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:51.500]  what's God's and to the state the things of the state but then it's all in a
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:57.820]  larger context so that's coming up and I want to get his take on the fact that
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:02.060]  everything we warned about is unfortunately unfolding Congress being
[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:08.900]  told we'll play some clips of this as well that no we don't come to you for
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:15.180]  war powers we go to the UN so not only are they saying hey the president has
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:19.580]  the war powers which is impeachable offense and impeachment proceedings have
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:25.100]  been initiated we're gonna get into that but he's saying I do it for the UN and
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.900]  NATO as he said last year in his resolution when Congress started suing
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:34.100]  him 10 members saying you can't watch a war in Libyan use our troops and
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:38.820]  military and aircraft without congressional authorization they said
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:45.060]  well we have the authorization of the UN and I do it for their credibility this
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:51.100]  is beyond treason it is sedition it is espionage it is a foreign occupation
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:55.340]  it's a coup d'etat and our article linkedin reddit info wars comm is coup
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:59.380]  d'etat pennant got an obama declare congress ceremonial on top of that the
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:04.900]  head of the FBI FBI director fails to refute state-sponsored murder of
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:08.920]  American citizens on u.s. soil incredible video that's coming up and now
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.500]  homeland security is calling mainline reporters we have copies of the emails
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.740]  and we've talked to one of the reporters off record and interview one of the
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:21.780]  source suggesting on air and homeland security said you better not interview
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:26.420]  that engineer exposing the scanners as frauds we're going to give you a
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:31.860]  warning don't interview them state police are now calling 5-9 air local
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.980]  affiliate well we're number one in some demographics number two and the others
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:41.900]  telling them wise alex jones on air trying to get me kicked off the air they
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:45.980]  think they can intimidate the radio station folks this is so unamerican it's
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:49.500]  so anti-freedom period communist china I'm gonna cover this with Pastor
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:54.860]  Baldwin is now passing a secret arrest secret torture secret killing bill and
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:12:00.660]  saying hey america did it modeled after the ndaa that's Reuters I mean this is
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:05.700]  incredible so they're going for broke now they've eaten around the edges for a
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.980]  long time now the slippery slope we're going fast down that slide but here's a
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:13.460]  little minute and a half clip three years after I was sent secret homeland
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:16.700]  security documents just like I was sent my act saying the veterans of the number
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.580]  one threat to homeland security and gun owners and Ron Paul and Chuck Baldwin
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.580]  everybody else nobody believed it when I got that it was real I was given secret
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:28.860]  documents from two different pastors well one of them I was given by Pastor
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:32.420]  butch paw from a pastor I talked to the pastor then another one sent me the same
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:35.380]  info where they were approached and told get everybody ready to go to FEMA
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:41.180]  camps will pay you this was in Iowa and then another one's in Ohio and prepare
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:45.380]  folks and say it's of the Lord to go to the camps during emergencies people
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:48.020]  didn't believe it even though it had phone numbers and documents then about a
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:53.060]  year and a half after they released newscast around the country with
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:58.780]  preachers saying martial law will it ever become a reality in America that's
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:02.180]  how the news clip starts the very first word is cut off it's only version we
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:06.860]  have this this was in Louisiana this is this aired in New Orleans but I've got
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:10.220]  other newscasts and I've talked now it's over a hundred thousand preachers have
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:14.340]  been recruited and paid to spy on their flocks and tell them give their guns up
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:21.300]  take the vaccines go to the camps when the attack happens so right out of the
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.580]  Soviet Union I'll play that clip go to Chuck Baldwin because his book is all
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:30.300]  about this and if we reach out and and and warn the pastors or identify those
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:34.260]  that are really homeland security wolves we can stop these globalist here's a
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:40.100]  clip of the preachers turned into secret police ever become a reality in
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:45.340]  America some fear any nuclear biological or chemical attack on U.S.
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:49.580]  territory might trigger just that and as case lay news 12 Jeff Farrell
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.580]  discovered the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:57.180]  problem us
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:03.220]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value the
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:07.900]  overarching desire to protect our freedoms but gun confiscation is
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:11.860]  exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:16.940]  in New Orleans U.S. troops also arrived something far easier to do even now
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:23.060]  thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 posse comatotus act that forbid
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:29.420]  U.S. troops from policing on American soil if martial law were enacted here at
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:33.780]  home like depicted in the movie the siege easing public fears and quelling
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:38.020]  dissent would be critical and that's exactly what the clergy response team as
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:42.460]  it's called help to accomplish in New Orleans the primary thing that we say
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.860]  to anybody's let's go out and get this thing over with and then we'll settle
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:49.980]  the differences once the crisis is over such clergy response teams would walk a
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:53.500]  tightrope between the needs of the government versus the wishes of the
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:57.780]  public in a lot of cases these clergy would already be known in the
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:01.700]  neighborhoods in which they're helping to diffuse that situation for the
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:05.700]  clergy one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:12.100]  down or obey the law is the Bible itself specifically Romans Romans 13
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:16.340]  because the government is established by the war you know and and that's what we
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:19.460]  believe in the Christian faith it's what's stated in the scripture civil rights
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:24.420]  advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:29.860]  long they expect the suspension of their rights might last Jeff Farrell KSLA news
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:36.860]  12 reporting now you noticed if she goes on to say clergy response teams were
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:40.060]  used during Katrina for gun confiscation and did a good job you can just type in
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:45.020]  clergy response teams into YouTube and watch it but we're going to Pastor
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.740]  Chuck Baldwin here but you notice they said help the government deal with its
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:51.820]  biggest threat we the people and that government is above us so we need to
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:55.180]  learn to serve them no we are the government here in the United States
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:59.860]  that's what the so I guess George Washington was of the devil to fight the
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.700]  corrupt king I guess all the prophets in the Bible who rebuked the kings and
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:07.260]  stood up I guess when John the Baptist went into Herod and said you're of the
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:12.660]  devil I guess Herod was the good one and John the Baptist he was the biggest
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:17.300]  Christ saying no to governments was bad I guess Paul was bad according to our
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:22.220]  devil preachers they are now again this book is so well written so so so well
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:26.740]  documented available at info wars.com Romans 13 pastor great to have you here
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:30.900]  I did that big intro here because I want people to see an example of how big an
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:34.340]  issue this is what what did you think of that little clip we just played yeah
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:38.700]  that's incredible and I'm so glad that you introduced the subject by playing
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:44.380]  that I know of pastors myself we have spoken and they have showed me the
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:50.020]  materials that they received at these training centers so the stuff that you
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:53.740]  talk about these closure response teams that's not hyperbole that is
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:59.980]  actuality it's reality it's happening they are trying to prepare pastors in
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:05.620]  America to be the the one who stands up in the pulpit and from the congregation
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:10.580]  encourages them to surrender their firearms and if necessary do whatever
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:15.140]  else the federal government might be necessary regarding whatever the
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:18.740]  emergency is declared so this is exactly the reality that you're talking
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:27.420]  about please continue pastor well that's why Tim and I wrote the book for the
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:33.740]  decades and decades preachers have been indoctrinated in this palatious
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:39.140]  interpretation of Romans chapter 13 obey the government no matter what and this
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:43.820]  is such a problem that coupled with the 501c3 tax exempt status of churches I
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:48.660]  think is the one too whammy as to why the churches in America today are
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:52.580]  neutered so Tim and I Tim as you know is the constitutional attorney he's a
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:57.700]  expert in the Constitution and he and I collaborated together and wrote this
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:03.500]  book on Romans 13 because we just had to get the truth of the real meaning of
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:07.980]  Romans chapter 13 and not just Romans chapter 13 Alex but the entire rest of
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:12.500]  scripture you know when Paul Penn Romans chapter 13 he was not introducing a new
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:17.900]  doctrine to the church he was simply reiterating what had been stated
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.020]  throughout the scriptures older New Testament so we take the Bible we go
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:25.940]  back into the Old Testament we go through the New Testament we quote the
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:31.500]  theologians and the philosophers of early America and beyond that and we
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:38.300]  show that the historical teaching of Christianity has never been to obey the
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.420]  government no matter what we believe that government is of God we believe
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:48.540]  that good government is of God we believe that we must follow the the good
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:53.100]  principles that God has established a natural all that relates to all
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:58.500]  government whether it's civil or family or or business whatever that happened
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:03.220]  to be there's all kinds of government but that each governing authority has a
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:08.580]  responsibility to God to obey the principles that God has established in
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:14.460]  his word that no authority even civil authority is above the natural all
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:18.220]  principles of God and so we go back into the scriptures both test them as
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.980]  hundreds of scripture references philosophers and theologians of early
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:27.780]  America and beyond that and we prove conclusively that the 2,000 year history
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:35.180]  of Christianity has always taught that government itself must submit to the
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:41.180]  fundamental natural all principles of God and when it doesn't it is the duty and
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:47.260]  the responsibility of men to resist that evil government and to stand for those
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:50.540]  sacred principles which God has enshrined in his word and that's why we
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:53.940]  have the famous quote by the founders resistance to tyrants is obedience to
[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:58.180]  God exactly Ben Franklin said that and that's why he could say that because he
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:02.260]  understood these natural all principles that I'm talking about as did
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:05.860]  Jefferson and the rest of the founding fathers and if we don't get the
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:11.620]  preachers of America to shake off this this asinine interpretation of Romans
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:17.780]  chapter 13 to obey the government no matter what we are going to repeat the
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:22.700]  fate and the destiny of Germany as you just mentioned in your model log
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:28.260]  opening this series because that is exactly what he did the Nazi regime
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:35.280]  took almost chapter 13 they they created entire messages around that
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:40.260]  palatious interpretation sent it out to the churches and the pastors and then
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:45.420]  they regurgitated it in their pulpits and not to Germany then that result was
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:51.100]  14,000 evangelical churches in Germany when that went when Hitler was rising
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:59.460]  power of those 14,000 evangelical churches 800 stood against it 805% of
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:07.180]  14,000 who tried to resist the others of the 95% went right along with with
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:10.540]  Hitler and of course the rest of history but according to the preachers we
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.340]  played earlier that you should have gotten on your knees and worshiped
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:18.060]  Hitler or Stalin or whole pot or anybody I mean it's just asinine I'm not a
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:22.300]  preacher but I know Sunday school the whole Bible is about resisting tyrants
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:27.020]  and Pharaoh and everybody else I mean it's ridiculous I mean I mean how do
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:30.580]  preachers with straight face say well go ahead and go along with abortion the
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:36.180]  government wants it we're the government yeah well several reasons as to why I
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:41.900]  think some of them it's a matter of cowardice and convenience quite frankly
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:46.900]  you know it many of them have become glorified politician they're climbing the
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:50.500]  corporate ladder they don't want to make waves and they don't want to cause
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:54.020]  controversy you know they've got their pay their paycheck they've got the
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:58.620]  retirement the 401k their insurance premiums are paid you know they're
[01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:02.340]  sitting very comfortably and they don't want to jeopardize that and of course it's
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:06.300]  that it's that careerism and cover your rear end and don't have any real values
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:10.460]  that is going to destroy the country and going to destroy everybody's future and
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:14.620]  career that's what all these go-along get-alongs don't get America's been great
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:19.060]  because we did resist tyranny we were far from perfect but we resisted to the
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.940]  greatest extent and it created incredible blessings and now as soon as we
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:28.180]  ignore what America was founded on all of our blessings are draining out
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:33.860]  exactly and I think the key is the pulpit I really do and that's why Tim
[01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:38.580]  and I wrote this book I'm so glad you're offering it it is absolutely
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:43.260]  fundamentally critical that Christians if we can get the layman if we can get
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:49.220]  this the church leaders of America to understand the true meaning of Romans
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:55.620]  chapter 13 and begin insisting that their pulpit teach the truth relative to
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:23:01.380]  Romans 13 we can see a difference in this country the churches have the power
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:06.020]  to change the direction of the country but as long as this the glaciers
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:09.940]  interpretation of almost 13 is prevalent nothing is going to be done
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:17.300]  that's why Tim and I wrote almost after 13 the true meaning of submission well
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:21.740]  you're you're right and and that's why I'm promoting this book I see it as a key
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:26.420]  weapon of truth against the corruption of the globalist to at least educate
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:30.580]  people in the churches and the pastors that can be reached with this
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:34.420]  information I've talked to some people that go in and ask their pastor even of
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.660]  many years in some cases about the clergy response team and suddenly the
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:41.500]  preacher calls them behind closed doors starts asking them questions tells them
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.380]  don't go down that road I don't want to have to report you I mean these
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:49.780]  preachers think they're living in East Germany or in Communist China during the
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:54.140]  Christian purges to sit there and say I don't want to have to report you as if
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:58.780]  it's illegal to say hey you're not in a secret relationship with the government
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:03.820]  are you I mean it's so bizarre that how these preachers get into the role of
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:08.260]  classic spies you know I mean just like they have the preacher and the mayor of
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:12.860]  the bad guys and are the collaborators and red dawn which is fictitious that was
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:16.180]  made back in the early 80s you know everybody hissed at them in the movie
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:20.140]  theater when I was a little kid going to see that with my dad I mean everybody
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:24.660]  even as a kid I knew the bad guy was the person you know spying on the citizens
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:29.940]  and now they're like you better be quiet yes I do work for Homeland how do you
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:33.940]  know about this like they get off on I have secret meetings with Homeland
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:39.940]  security and I I spy on my flock and I've talked to high-level Baptist
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:43.220]  preachers here in town after some of their members told me about it and they
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:47.020]  hand out at the big church's sheets saying don't even discuss politics or
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:52.380]  issues at church barbecues at the park or or or in the pews because of
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:56.300]  separation of church and state but then Obama as you know two weeks ago put out
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:25:03.700]  a film calling on quote African-Americans for Obama and he says I want team leaders
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:08.420]  and election leaders in your churches turn your churches into engines of my
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:11.780]  reelection campaign now he knows he can do that because there really is no
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:14.820]  separation of church and state Congress can make no law respecting an
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:18.580]  establishment of religion or prohibiting this exercise thereof government can't
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:22.100]  get involved but churches can do whatever they want so he knows it's a
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:26.180]  buffalo telling churches you can't believe politically involved but they
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:31.220]  selectively threaten the 501c3 while at the same time using the churches for
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:35.780]  their own aims but how did they get preachers to be such incredible agents
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:42.020]  of government well that that is a great question you know I was I was very
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:47.540]  involved in the more majority as you know back of the in the 80s dr. Fallow
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:50.860]  asked me to be the executive director of the Port of Moore majority which I was
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:57.620]  and you know I I really saw the inside of all of that and there was a progression
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:02.300]  that took place or decression I want to say it that took place during that time
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:08.140]  I think what happened was and this this is what I believe that having
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:13.220]  experienced it firsthand and seeing the inside of how all that worked and how it
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:19.140]  developed Alex I really believe what happened was the the preachers and the
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.500]  Christian leaders the so-called religious right in America during that
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:31.620]  time were so desirous to obtain a seat at the table and that's that's the word
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:35.900]  that I mean that's the phrase that that I heard at a national press conference I
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:41.220]  was president at in Washington DC when Gary Bauer actually said that all we
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:47.580]  wanted is to seat at the table well they got their seat at the table and once
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:54.540]  they tasted the benefits and and the luxuries of being able to sit at the
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:59.620]  king's table they made a decision that that's what they wanted and they were
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:04.540]  not going to give it up no matter what and the principles and convictions that
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:10.020]  drove them to get involved and to try and make a difference in our country back
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:16.420]  there in the late 70s and the early 80s became a desire to seek the king's
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:22.140]  benefit and as a result since then the government quickly found the politicals
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:27.140]  the power elite quickly figured out that these preachers and Christian leaders
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:33.700]  could be easily bribed through a variety of methods phone calls from the White
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:38.420]  House invitations to private dinners I was about to say pastor I'm glad you're
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:43.140]  giving us this inside baseball I saw the city council sell out for 50 plus
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:47.940]  million dollars to help build a formula one track with our tax money just because
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:53.140]  they got invited reportedly in the future to sit in the box with the rich
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:57.940]  people I mean literally a lot of times people sell out just to be invited to the
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:02.940]  party not even for money it's so pathetic what you just pointed out and
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:06.460]  but then now they're getting money under Bush and now under Obama it's totally
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:11.820]  unconstitutional faith-based initiative it turns out secret you know vans big
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:16.300]  screen TVs AV equipment they even get small churches to sell out for a few
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:21.580]  thousand dollars of government money to churches that's totally illegal can you
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:26.500]  speak to that oh absolutely yeah yeah I you and I both railed against that back
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:30.700]  when GW Bush first introduced that this whole faith-based initiative program
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:37.620]  which took you know taxpayer dollars and gave them directly to the churches and
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:41.620]  as soon as I found out that was going on I recognized immediately what was
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:46.620]  happening this was nothing more than a bribe to silence the churches and to get
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:50.500]  their corporation in whatever was that the government was doing at the time and
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:54.460]  you're right I mean they're doing it for their Christian schools their private
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:58.580]  schools are doing it for many of their so-called missionary projects etc.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:03.660]  they're getting faith-based initiative monies and as a result of that they're
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:07.780]  not going to say anything contrary to whatever the government would wish them
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:13.740]  to do because they are getting a direct benefit from the government for being
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:17.380]  culpable in all of that and that's state-run media I mean that's right out
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:21.060]  of China and Russia I mean under communism you still had churches they
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:24.940]  were just government-funded and certified pastor Chuck Baldwin's our guest folks
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:29.700]  the book is Romans 13 the true meaning of submission I think it dovetails nicely
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:33.900]  with behind the green mask you and agenda 21 both these books are key for
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:38.700]  pastors members of your flock the fight is going on for the heart and soul in
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:43.080]  these churches take your churches back not just take your states counties and
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:47.580]  cities back nullify the globalist brainwashing at your church level today

[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:18.460]  happening here but it's totally a legitimate I want to get into actual
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:21.620]  Bible verses and even if you're not a Christian folks the point is this
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:26.380]  country says it's 80% Christian 100 plus million people go to church every week
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:30.060]  they really do what their preachers tell them instead of going to the Bible you
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:32.900]  need to find a preacher that actually goes to the Bible and that sounds
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.300]  simple that's not what's happening but even if you're not a Christian
[01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:38.260]  understand that's what's governing this country to a great extent is the
[01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:42.980]  churches and neutralized it was the churches that gave the moral support to
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:47.060]  fight the greatest empire the world had ever seen and defeated back then the
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:50.860]  preachers across the nominations were black was called the black brigades that
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:55.660]  led the war some of the first people to die were preachers at Lexington and
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:59.860]  Concord they were leading the fights they they were handing out the muskets in
[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:06.220]  the churches they would keep the muskets in the churches now look at it I mean you
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:12.900]  talk about servile demonic creatures there been a few national TV preachers
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:17.980]  that I've seen speak out against this evil one of them was that preacher out
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:20.940]  of Florida that died a few years ago I remember I go to my grandma's house she'd
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:25.820]  have him on he'd be talking about it there's a very few out there that are
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.180]  actually covering this and now I want to get into the Romans 13 book which is

[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:37.720]  preachers it's a good test to see a lot of times they're not pushing the
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:41.340]  clergy response team stuff publicly they're waiting till the crisis happens
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:44.900]  you need to identify I mean you'll see the some of the messages about do what
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:48.100]  government says and don't talk about politics here and you know don't
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:52.180]  organize in this church that's a telltale sign some of them are overtly
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:56.020]  admitting their clergy response teams are part of infregard you need to give
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:59.380]  them this book and ask him pastor read this and tell me what you think month
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:05.500]  later did you read it if not why and then I think you should find a different
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:08.500]  church if they won't even read the book and won't even tell you what they think
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:12.500]  or they tell you they're for it you should try to intervene with them and
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:15.780]  get past the fake authority of one of these preachers they only have authority
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:19.460]  when they're doing God's work and and you know they sit there try to brush you
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:25.060]  off you say listen this isn't a game okay I mean imagine I grew up hearing
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:27.860]  about China where the preachers were spies and they had government-run
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:32.820]  churches I mean that's what this is so I want to get into it and you can also
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:41.340]  call and get the book 8882533139 8882533139 it's 1995 very handsome book as
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:45.780]  well so and then that's good to get people to read it but I know that I had
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:48.460]  Dave Mustang at my house this weekend a Christian and he happened to see it out
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:52.820]  of all these books laying around he's like wow what's this oh have a copy and
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:57.540]  I talked to him a few days ago he's like well that's an amazing book so again it
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:37:02.460]  really pops out at people and when you purchase it it supports pastor Chuck
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:06.100]  Baldwin's work and also our work here and again I think it really dovetails with
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:11.660]  behind-the-green-mask UN agenda 21 by Rosa Corey a great to give your
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:14.980]  pastors but also city council county commissioners you name it these are
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:19.700]  info war weapons that are you know short books but very well written I want to
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.980]  get more into the book here in a moment but but but shifting gears into the
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:26.660]  wider area pastor Chuck Baldwin presidential candidate constitutional
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:30.620]  expert his son a constitutional lawyer writing the book with him I have the
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:34.940]  headline coup d'etat Pentagon and Obama declare Congress ceremonial I don't know
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:38.180]  I didn't ask this for the interview but it's been out for two days I don't know
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:42.060]  if you've seen the video a Panetta sec death and the chairman of the joint
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:45.100]  chief saying no we don't come to Congress for war we go to the UN for that
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:49.820]  authority yeah okay so you did see it I want to get your take on that and I've
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:54.780]  had constitutional lawyers on I've had members the military on like Tony Shaffer
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:38:00.100]  they say this is illegal and it is treason what do you say I say ditto
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:06.060]  yeah can you can you imagine after reading George Washington's farewell
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:11.900]  address when he very plainly and succinctly states that no uncertain term
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:17.460]  that America should avoid at all costs foreign entanglements that we should
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:21.780]  seek peace and free trade with all nations but that we should never get
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:27.700]  involved in their political affairs can you imagine of that sentiment and then
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:33.260]  turning around and hearing what Mr. Panetta said is that Congress the
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:38.100]  Congress the United States is not the agent by which America goes to war or
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:42.460]  not but the United Nation or any other international organization that might
[01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:52.020]  apply the egregiousness of this it is so severe that it really does strain the
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:57.980]  imagination I think what it does show is the is the boldness of these globalists
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:03.700]  today they assume that there's nothing that is going to be done to challenge
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:08.540]  it they assume that they can get by with it they assume that they are going to
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:11.740]  accrue this power under themselves and that no one is going to resist them it's
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:15.060]  total hubris in fact I'm everybody I've talked to including you says the same
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:18.100]  thing the senator said they had trouble that they're actually catching their
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:21.860]  breath they had adrenaline rushes because the treason was so open the crime was so
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:25.740]  huge I mean the cornerstone being assaulted everyone I've talked to says
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:30.500]  the same thing that it's staggering that it's shocking because for those of us
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:36.100]  that do know history I mean Congressman Jones has introduced the impeachment
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:40.460]  resolutions you know points out that the cornerstone of the republic is
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:44.460]  honoring Congress's inclusive power to declare war under article 1 section 8
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:47.780]  clause 11 and he goes on to say it's a high crime and misdemeanor if the
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:54.340]  president took this power but to to to say he does it under a foreign power is
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:58.700]  espionage is said to it'd be like helicopters landing with foreign troops
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:05.460]  and saying they taken the capital over I mean it's just it's incredible yeah it
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:08.500]  is and and again I think it's because they assume that they're going to be
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:11.860]  able to get by with it and and of course they're not but going back to the
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:15.380]  Rollins 13 book I think this is why the woman's 13 book is so important is
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:20.420]  because how many preachers are going to stand up in their pulpits when they
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:25.460]  hear this information and they're going to say to their people this is unconstitutional
[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:30.860]  this is immoral this is an American and this is unbiblical and then go into the
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:35.100]  scripture and highlight the principles from the word of God to establish in the
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:41.020]  hearts of the minds of the people the reasons why this is wrong and why real
[01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:45.780]  Americans and real Christians cannot and must not submit to this this is what's
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:51.620]  missing this is what's missing this is what we had back in 1775 you mentioned
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:57.300]  it a minute ago he referenced it on April 19 1775 when that child was fired
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:02.700]  around the world and Lexington Green well who fired the shot well the history
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:06.500]  books they'll usually tell you this but who fired the shot was Pastor Jonas
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:11.580]  Clark and his male congregants from the church at Lexington they were the
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:16.940]  minute men that stood on Lexington Green and fired on on the Redcoats as they
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:21.620]  were marching towards Concord to confiscate the firearms and to arrest
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:27.540]  Sam Adams and John Hancock it was Christian men and a Christian pastor
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:32.300]  that literally fired the shot heard around the world which started our war
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:36.540]  for independence but that's what's not being taught and that's what's missing in
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:42.380]  our society today is that courageous black regiment pastor who stands in
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:46.460]  front of his block and teaches them the principles of the word of God with the
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:50.420]  courage and the conviction of his heart as to what those principles are the
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:55.260]  people gather together and they hear these principles and they're motivated
[01:41:55.260 --> 01:42:00.660]  and inspired by these principles so that when tyranny comes they can see it
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:04.860]  they can identify it they know what it is and they know what to do about it and
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:08.660]  that's why the system has tried to take over the churches in every case because
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:11.500]  they know and I'm not trying to get religious here folks but I'm being
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:15.300]  honest with you they know that the Holy Spirit will direct you to resist
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:18.300]  tyranny I mean if you're really a Christian folks never relationship with
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:21.380]  God you're not going to be able to control yourself to resist tyranny these
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:25.140]  people that are scared to resist it and speak out against it folks if you've got
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:29.100]  God living in your heart you can't control yourself to resist tyranny oh
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:33.380]  amen to that and that was what was what was so critical about the
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:37.980]  Revolutionary War period and that's why they they were called the the black
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:42.660]  regiment that was a moniker they was given by the crowd because what was
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:46.420]  going on was these preachers all the nomination this cuts across every
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:51.820]  denomination all the dominations of that period were trumpeting forth these
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:56.300]  principles that we're talking about here and and it's so in sense that the
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:59.820]  British crown that they referred to them as the black regiment they gave them
[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:03.500]  that moniker because number one they went to the pulpit with the black roads
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:07.700]  and that's where the black came from and in the regiment they referred to that
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:12.380]  military term because they were they were at the forefront of the independence
[01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:16.140]  movement and the Liberty movement of that period so they referred to them as
[01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:20.660]  the black regiment they were so influential in the minds and the hearts
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:25.100]  and the and thinking of the colonial Americans at that time that they knew
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:30.740]  that it was the those colonial pulpits that was actually behind our war for
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:33.540]  independence without them there would have been no war for independence
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:37.660]  that's what's missing today Alex and the reason it's missing I think it's
[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:42.020]  because of this erroneous relations interpretation of Romans 13 they had
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:47.220]  just bought into this hook line and sinker and it's made slaves of them and
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:51.220]  until the Christians and I have while we want the pastors to get it look let's
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:54.620]  get this out to the Christians let's get this out to the church members the
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:58.220]  people in the pews and even those that the listeners right now that are not
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:02.180]  Christians you all interact with Christians you have friends they're
[01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:06.100]  Christians you work with Christians you're in athletics with Christians you
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:09.340]  need to get this book to familiarize yourself with the principles of the
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:12.780]  scripture so that you can talk to other Christians what if the opportunity
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:17.100]  arises and you can show them from the scripture what is the true meaning of
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:20.860]  this issue if you believe in Liberty whether you're Christian or not Romans
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:27.820]  chapter 13 affects you let me pose this question to you pastor Chuck Baldwin as
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:32.620]  our guest how would you approach let's say been going to a Baptist church
[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:37.500]  Methodist Catholic whatever it is for 20 years and you get a letter saying it's
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:41.540]  of the Lord to turn your guns in that's now as you know happening or it's of the
[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:45.420]  Lord to just submit to FEMA which they're now teaching just why is why are my
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:50.840]  kids being taught this how would you approach the pastor you know with the
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:54.460]  information and then what would you do if they start you know trying to
[01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:57.860]  intimidate you to shut up and then you learn that they're actually an agent with
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:03.820]  all due respect and I've been a pastor for over 35 years so what I'm about to
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:09.580]  say I say with all due respect there's no way that a Christian who knows the
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:16.900]  Bible a Christian who loves God and who loves freedom could sit in a
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:23.500]  congregation and participate and give his ties and offerings and support to a
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:30.340]  pastor in a congregation that would ask him to submit to tyranny to confiscate
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:36.500]  his guns etc. there's no way but there comes a point in time where you have to
[01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:42.460]  vote with your feet I mean I know that that's hard for some Christians and our
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:46.100]  you know you have friends at that church and your and your family tradition
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:51.820]  may be in that church and and you love the history of that church etc etc but
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:58.580]  there comes a time when if that pastor and that congregation are going to of
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:05.300]  their own accord and of their own will take that congregation into tyranny and
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:11.780]  ask you or even demand of you that you participate in that servitude there's
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:17.980]  no way that a real Christian could sit there and and maintain membership there
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:21.940]  and maintain support there and continue to give their ties and offerings there
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:27.860]  look if the people of America at the Churchmen of America would go to their
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:34.100]  pastors and and say I mean I'm talking about across the board we are not going
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:38.380]  to put up with this we are not turning in our firearms we are not going to be
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:43.180]  silenced we are not going to allow these international tyrants to run over our
[01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:48.700]  country our freedoms our children's future etc and if you don't lead at the
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:53.900]  charge for freedom and truth then we are going to find a pastor that will and by
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:57.580]  the way I know that you that there are many many people listening to you right
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:06.100]  now Alex that are desperate to find a patriot pastor I if with your permission
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:11.980]  I like to give my website because we have about 500 pastors across America that
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:15.900]  have volunteered to be on our black regiment list oh good I didn't even
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:20.580]  know about this I want to find one here in Austin yeah and go to my website it's
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:27.620]  it's www.chuckbaldwinlive.com all one word Chuck Baldwin live.com and
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:33.620]  there's a link it says black regiment and you click on that and it comes up
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:38.300]  state by state and you can go to your state and you can look through the list
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:44.260]  and if there is a black regiment pastor near where you live now you have found a
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:48.620]  man that's willing to stand up for the truth and you can go to his church. I hope
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:53.340]  we don't crash your website because people are interested in that we I tell
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:57.860]  you I mean it it's just it's just a fantastic what you're doing you know I
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:02.460]  I wanted to play a clip but I'm at the doing Bob Chapman's on with us of the
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:07.580]  FBI director and it's on Fox News saying you know what I don't know the
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:10.940]  president's allowed to kill Americans secretly in America I got to check with
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:14.820]  him and of course you know Congress gave Obama that power but just they could
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:19.100]  give him the power to fill a children in the White House law and you know a law
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:22.900]  that's repugnant is still illegal Marbury versus Madison I mean it's just
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:26.540]  common sense there's God's law common law organic law whatever you want to call
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:29.940]  it you can pass whatever law you want you can pass a law saying black people
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:33.340]  aren't humans but as soon as they stand up and resist we know who has the moral
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:38.460]  authority and and as the founder of the Texas Rangers said nobody in the wrong
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:42.380]  can stand up against a man in the right who keeps on a coming and the key is
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:46.220]  when you just stop caring and say I'm doing what's right that's the end of it
[01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:50.220]  I'm coming on against your evil evil can't stand against that it can crush
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:55.060]  some of us individually but they cannot kill ideas no army can stop an idea whose
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:00.700]  time has come but to look at the NDAA to look at Obama's saying last year I
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:05.260]  don't need Congress I have the UN and and the Congress has sat there well the
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:09.340]  next step is going to be Obama marching in his thugs to literally look at the
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:13.300]  senators and say no you don't you're not involved in war-making when the
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:18.900]  Constitution says that's the law I mean this is beyond treason pastor what is it
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:21.900]  when it's beyond treason that's your son constitutional lawyer I've asked them
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:26.300]  I mean it is sedition when you're working for a foreign power to overthrow the
[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:31.540]  existing government through a national security state that is a foreign coup
[01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:36.340]  d'etat through trader operatives but it's not a government it's a global
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:42.060]  corporate system the new world order I mean what do we do about this I mean I've
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:45.620]  gone on air and called for their arrest I've called for their impeachment within
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:49.300]  an hour we learned it already begun but they're only saying if he doesn't come
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:53.380]  now and you know admit he has to get approval then the impeachment proceeding
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:57.740]  begins what about Libya we need impeachment now we need to I mean this
[01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:04.940]  is outrageous impeachment is not enough yeah I hear you Alex and I this is why
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:09.980]  I think it's important that and this is a whole nother topic but I just think
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:14.820]  it's incredibly important that we start recognizing the importance of the state
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:21.860]  the power and authority that is God given to the state each state is a nation
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:27.860]  state with its own natural law rights and authority that's been granted to us
[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:32.980]  by God and whenever we became a nation the Constitution was was ratified
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:39.260]  that were drafted in 1787 and 1789 we did not abandon state government we did
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:43.700]  we did not become a man stay there stay there exactly now that the feds have
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:46.340]  killed the state governments that are still there but dormant and they're
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:50.540]  waking up now the feds are being told the Congress is being told you're you
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:54.980]  don't count either it's the UN it's NATO I mean that's what they're saying we're
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:59.260]  gonna come back with nullification states rights and the Pentagon plan to
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:03.780]  crush the state straight ahead so you're a maker of something wood crafts

[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:39.940]  Christian really strengthened my faith and I'm not trying to make this
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:44.220]  religious but as the world gets worse and worse I'm I've never hidden my my faith
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:48.220]  but let me tell you it's the answer this is pure evil we're fighting that's why
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:50.940]  they're trying to take over the churches but that Dave Mustaine is gonna
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:53.980]  premiere next hour with some of the zingers of the big hour and a half
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:55:00.180]  interview we're gonna premiere next week and I've also got to get into some

[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:07.820]  to a pastor Chuck Baldwin the book is Romans 13 the true meaning of submission

[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:15.940]  Chuck Baldwin both great men great minds and also behind the green mask unit

[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:33.620]  to go if you want to stay five minutes the next hour you can and we'll then go
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:36.860]  to Bob Chapman after that if you got to go here in three minutes I understand I
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:39.300]  should have asked you during the break but to getting into state
[01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:43.020]  nullification I've confirmed under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:48.620]  I've confirmed for military sources the feds are preparing to militarily try to
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:52.060]  invade the states remember last year when they said no to TSA the feds say
[01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:57.140]  we'll run a combat blockade of your airwaves with F-16s I mean it just
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:01.860]  shows how the federal government has been captured by foreign criminals and
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:07.180]  but but it is the solution that's why they're so scared of it pastor yeah
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:12.620]  there's no question the Federalist Papers even Alexander Hamilton was very
[01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:16.880]  clear that they anticipated that it would be the states that would
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:21.420]  jealously guard the liberties and freedoms of the citizens within the
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:26.820]  states against the overreach of the federal government this is something
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:30.420]  that historically true goes only back to the foundation of our country and the
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:35.060]  formation of our Constitution and I think now there are there are some states
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:40.740]  that are beginning to awaken and to re-exert their their authority on the
[01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:46.180]  Constitution and to begin to resist some of these tyrannical tendencies of the
[01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:49.580]  federal government and I think you know what you just said there a minute ago
[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:54.700]  let's not forget to that there are there's a lot of constitutionalist
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:57:03.060]  God fearing men and in our military that understand what's going on and they
[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:09.220]  are not they just flat will not participate in some kind of a a coup
[01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:13.540]  against the Constitution and the American people if that was suggested
[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:17.340]  require you agree with me that the coup with these announcements of NDAA and
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:21.340]  telling Congress they have no authority over war is the coup not taking place
[01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:25.780]  publicly right now sure it is it always does it always has I mean that's what
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:29.820]  it was that's what was done in Germany it was done in China but it's always done
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:32.860]  publicly first because you have to prepare the minds and the hearts of
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:38.580]  people for what is coming you can't just surprise them with it they would react
[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:42.740]  negatively so you have to prepare them emotionally and psychologically and
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:46.180]  mentally etc so that's exactly what they're doing they're in that stage
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:49.540]  right now where they're trying to prepare the hearts and the minds of
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:53.620]  people for what they have in store for us and that's why we've got to fight as
[01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:59.820]  hard as we can to answer it and say no no that's why your show is so important
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:04.060]  that's why if all these folks are on the country that are standing up for
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:07.340]  freedom and liberty and the constitutional government that's why
[01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:11.180]  their voices are so important and that's why it's critically important that we
[01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:15.260]  get the information that you're talking about into the hands of the people
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:21.500]  because it an informed society will not be able to will not enslave itself they
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:27.260]  they will resist them and and God will be with them and God will strengthen them
[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:31.140]  and God will encourage them and I believe that he will help assist them
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:34.460]  just as he did our founding fathers over 200 years ago
[01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:37.540]  amen to that I tell you what stay there back in one minute five more minutes with
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:46.980]  pastor Chuck Baldwin right back you are listening to GCN visit GCN live calm

[01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:01.300]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:05.220]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver
[01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:08.940]  before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:12.940]  friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid

[02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:40.500]  podcasts for a political talk show at info wars dot com thanks to all you
[02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:44.420]  spread the word and our tireless efforts here in the crew but I do look
[02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:47.220]  forward to getting him on video Skype folks can actually see him we're
[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:50.940]  watching on prison planet dot TV we got about five minutes in this segment and
[02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:55.580]  Bob Chapman's coming up and exclusive excerpts of the Dave Mustaine interview
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:01:01.380]  and a big breakdown of a bunch of news I'm gonna expose this new Coney 2012
[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:06.100]  thing about invading Africa it's all the UN and others behind that so we're gonna
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:11.580]  be breaking that down as well finishing up pastor in the time we have with the
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:15.380]  states rights movement the system is attacking that because as you said they
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:19.020]  know that's one of the keys that the founders gave us to reverse this but I'm
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:24.100]  also just want to point out now the UN through the president saying Congress you
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:27.820]  don't count first they nullify the states now they're nullifying the federal
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:32.660]  government now it's totally clear you know not only are the states in trouble
[02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:38.420]  the federal government's being taken over sir yeah I think the goal along was
[02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:43.940]  to bring an international element to the government of our country they see
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:49.220]  America as as the big prize it's the big Apple has got a fall from the tree in
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:54.380]  order to merge together this so if this new world order this this global
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:59.420]  society and of course it's all generated by money it's generated by
[02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:03.580]  international bankers and international corporations who really are
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:09.140]  encumbered with all of these national rules and regulations governing
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:12.500]  commerce and what they want to do is they want to break down those those
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:17.820]  barriers so that they can interact internationally as they would interact
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:22.620]  nationally what that's what that's been the goal I think all along and you've
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:27.540]  you've trumped that for for many years as many of us have and so I think what
[02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:33.020]  we're seeing here is the second step as you said first let's just nullify the
[02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:37.500]  states instead of the state's nullifying unlawful government from the federal
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:41.580]  government let's nullify the states and now let's nullify Congress so that we
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:46.500]  can bring about this this globalist union that that we that we want to create
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:52.020]  and that's been the goal along I think it's just been a matter of steps well
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:55.460]  our job is easier than ever because we warn people about the new world order
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:59.220]  Ron Paul did you did countless others did for so long we got laughed at made
[02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:02.420]  fun of because we were informed now everybody's like wow everything you
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:06.140]  said is coming true so I don't think they counted on us being there for the
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:10.020]  last you know 30 40 50 years some people in the case of G. Edward Griffin or
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:14.740]  people like Bob Chapman or Red Beckman and I think that's our real ace in the
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:19.300]  hole and as you said Providence history shown that that when good people take
[02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:25.580]  action the Martin Luther King said the universe bends towards justice I truly
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:32.660]  believe that God is the author of freedom not government God God is they is
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:39.180]  a is the founder of freedom he is a promoter of freedom his children have
[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:43.660]  always been involved in the freedom fight in one way or the other he has
[02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:47.620]  inspired men from Moses all the way through the judges the Old Testament
[02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:52.220]  prophets and the New Testament apostles who stood up and fought for liberty the
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:55.980]  principles of freedom that was established by God our Creator who gives
[02:03:55.980 --> 02:04:01.180]  us a free will to choose him as our Savior and who wants us to serve him by
[02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:05.860]  our will and by our choice and so God is the promoter of freedom he's the
[02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:10.900]  defender of freedom and when men and women stand up courageously in the
[02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:16.180]  faticably for the principles of freedom I believe with all my heart that God
[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:20.020]  will fight with us he did it for our forefathers and I believe he'll do it for
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:24.980]  us but we've got a I've seen it my own life when I go through a fear through a
[02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:29.940]  concern I can feel these developmental thresholds that when I just say you know
[02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:34.300]  what I'm giving it to you God and but then take action on faith that's when
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:40.700]  the power kicks in and I've seen it pastor I know it's real yep me too I

[02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:04.700]  about politics about you name it it's a big interview and you know Dave was
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:08.340]  gonna come out here three or four months ago but I'd already booked a trip with
[02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:11.460]  my children down the beach for a couple days and then he was gonna come a few
[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:16.380]  months ago and he had and have neck surgery so didn't come and then he did
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:20.060]  come to town and just end his tour here in Austin and it's a powerful interview
[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:25.140]  powerful on a whole host of subjects we've got a little three-minute promo
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:28.620]  we're gonna air coming up at the bottom of the hour and then continuing with Bob

[02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:37.940]  Fox is one of the few good people on there other than Judge Napolitano
[02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:41.700]  I mean I agree with his politics but he gets mad about predator drones to kill
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:46.100]  Americans and the FBI director saying yeah we may kill citizens in the US just
[02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:49.660]  secretly just you know you disappear that's always the greatest threat in
[02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:53.140]  history as governments start doing that but they're like we're gonna keep you
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:57.740]  safe for some terrorists that we run in the Middle East and but we're gonna
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:02.100]  secretly arrest you and the UN runs things now so that's a clip we're gonna
[02:10:02.100 --> 02:10:06.860]  playing it Bob Chapman's take on as well I've been trying to take more calls
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:11.540]  lately I took a lot of calls yesterday but so much is happening my head is
[02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:16.420]  starting to spin we've got an NSA whistleblowers as Obama worse than Bush
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:20.100]  more spying without warrants well yeah courts are ruling the police can pull
[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:23.580]  you over and grab your phone and download the contents without warrants
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:28.260]  phone numbers contacts everything photographs I mean it's just a wall
[02:10:28.260 --> 02:10:33.260]  listen to us we've got a case of tyranny and it's spreading fast it's like
[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:36.420]  gangrene we better get this taken care of
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:44.420]  poronto I mean undelay undelay undelay a reba a reba as Speedy Gonzales says we
[02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:49.940]  need to deal with this right now okay I mean I'm literally like Speedy Gonzales
[02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:53.820]  is running around waving my arms here I mean this needs to be done yesterday I
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:57.620]  mean I'm sitting there having it was my wife smart she's lived all over the
[02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:00.780]  world and she's like I know we're fighting we can do it from outside the
[02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:04.540]  US we we need to get out of here I mean I'm having to put my foot down and go I
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:09.140]  understand that but me it's getting to the point where I may have to get her
[02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:13.940]  out of the country and the energy I mean listen I'm that concerned if this
[02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:18.180]  continues I'm gonna have to get my wife out of the country I mean this isn't a
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:24.980]  game this is not a joke this is not a drill they don't try to say foreign
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:29.700]  groups run the country to the Congress because they're not planning to do that
[02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:35.780]  they don't have the NLE09 three years ago and say 15 countries militaries are
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:39.740]  trying to take on domestic extremist and terrorist they don't sign agreement
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:46.580]  agreements to use Mexican and Canadian troops here in the US because they want
[02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:50.060]  to play patty cake with us they don't say we're gonna secretly arrest citizens
[02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:53.700]  and disappear into black holes for no reason just as Pastor Baldwin just said
[02:11:53.700 --> 02:12:00.300]  they do it so that they can sell everybody and test everybody folks
[02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:02.820]  they're gonna take everything it's gonna be a total collapse the way this is
[02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:06.300]  going now if they decide they can't execute this police state they'll back
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:11.060]  off and not bring in a depression it's on record they're engineering all this
[02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:16.220]  you think the economy's bad now you ain't see nothing yet with liberty comes
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:24.020]  prosperity with tyranny comes poverty I mean it's very simple equations now I
[02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:29.140]  want to explain something here this is beyond Caesar crossing the Rubicon and
[02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:32.980]  overthrowing the Roman Republic Obama didn't say he can launch wars and kill
[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:37.580]  whoever he wants because he's the president which is treason and violates
[02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:41.980]  article 1 section 8 clause 12 and there's impeachment stuff introduced on
[02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:48.820]  this now this is big and if he gets away with this they're gonna use it he went
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:53.020]  further he said I do this under foreign power in a letter and that's what the
[02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:57.220]  sec death and others said they're they decided to go with the person that put
[02:12:57.220 --> 02:13:01.940]  them in well Congress commissioned those officers but decades ago there's a
[02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:04.380]  reason because you don't let the president pick his own guys it'll take
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:15.420]  over duh duh no brainer and so I talked to these cops and people especially the
[02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:19.180]  militarized ones and the SWAT team guys and they act like robots and act like
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:22.580]  you're not a person they're like that'll never happen well we know best well we
[02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:26.220]  can we won't abuse that authority won't abuse that authority they're gonna take
[02:13:26.220 --> 02:13:31.420]  all your pension funds dummy they're gonna ruin your future as well look
[02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:35.060]  America is the Declaration of Independence Bill of Rights Constitution
[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:39.980]  and when you start putting it down and acting like it's stupid well then you're
[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:44.700]  putting down America I don't know how else to explain it to you I know a lot of
[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:47.660]  police and military are waking up especially the military and look Ron
[02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:50.540]  Paul has been defrauded I told everybody was gonna happen they said well why did
[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:56.220]  you support him then why did you support Ron Paul because he educated people and
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:59.420]  he showed the election fraud but everybody's like wow you're right again
[02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:04.180]  how did you know in fact there's tape that's been released that I think's real
[02:14:04.180 --> 02:14:08.940]  that was recorded in an Obama event when he thought the mic was off or in fact
[02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:13.620]  ask Rob do for that we'll play later and get Bob's take on it and he's saying
[02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:16.300]  yeah I know Rick's out it's gonna be meant Romney and you know what they did to
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:21.740]  Ron Paul in Maine I don't blame them and let me tell you when that calling intake
[02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:25.900]  a famous comedian called my house and posed as Bush and everybody thought it
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:32.780]  was real I didn't put it on the web man calended up doing it and to see if
[02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:37.220]  folks bought it and I said I think it's a comedian it's not George Bush I can
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:42.080]  tell this if this isn't Obama it's some computer that's recorded him and then
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:47.740]  put it back together again I mean it's Obama and it or it's his twin
[02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:52.980]  brother because I mean it sounds it's Obama I mean my gut my brain says
[02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:59.660]  that's Obama may be fake but then it's some computer splice of Obama and my
[02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:05.460]  point is is that this is real I mean we're being conquered by foreign
[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:09.100]  megabanks and that's what Time Magazine says but it's like oh isn't it good the
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:13.300]  banks are gonna run everything now now Bob Chapman of almost 50 years fighting
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:18.780]  this wrote the biggest newsletter for a while till he retired came back he joins
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:23.300]  us now to break this down but obviously Bob the big news is coup d'etat Pentagon
[02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:27.660]  Obama declare Congress ceremonial they're now going back on their thing
[02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:30.740]  and saying well we do have the power to kill citizens foreign and domestic we'll
[02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:35.660]  go ahead and do that so I mean they're really trying to push torture secret
[02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:40.060]  arrest all the stuff we know that is the bad guys and saying it's to fight
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:46.260]  Al Qaeda when Al Qaeda publicly works for him Bob Chapman what is your view on
[02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:52.100]  the public statements to Congress that they can hit the road jack and don't you
[02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:55.540]  come back no more no more no more what do you make of this gauntlet being
[02:15:55.540 --> 02:16:03.700]  thrown down well if you go back to the 1960s and 70s and you'll find that we
[02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:09.420]  contemplated these such kind of things but we thought that because we had an
[02:16:09.420 --> 02:16:15.300]  electric Congress and a president but particularly Congress that we would get
[02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:22.100]  some cooperation and some help and we did and then as things moved into the
[02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:27.940]  90s and then beyond we started to get less and less and that's really we were
[02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:37.100]  at today and what they're saying now is Congress is ceremonial and as is the
[02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:43.540]  US government for that matter and the UN runs everything and we take our
[02:16:43.540 --> 02:16:52.100]  orders for them and it's in in your face again and the question is how do you stop
[02:16:52.100 --> 02:16:57.900]  them well you're right Bob and and of course Caesar made the Senate
[02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:02.020]  ceremonial but I mean they're there telling him no you don't watch war you
[02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:06.500]  don't you don't do anything you don't have the nothing and they went for
[02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:09.580]  they said the UN gives us the orders which is what the Supreme Court
[02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:13.100]  justices have now been saying I mean they're they're doing this on purpose
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:16.820]  they're just acclimating everyone now of course as you know Walter Jones in the
[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:20.340]  House and others in the Senate have introduced and here's the bill we'll
[02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:23.900]  actually put it on screen for people they've actually introduced to the 112th
[02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:31.340]  Congress H.com.res 107 so it's house concurrent resolution 107 and it's got
[02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:35.660]  a Senate bill as well and it says it's a high crime and that it's treason and
[02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:39.500]  that Obama had better seek their approval in future operations but he
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:43.140]  know what about Libya last year where he said he did it for the UN I guess they
[02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:46.660]  just didn't like the public affront of them coming in and telling them they
[02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:55.700]  were ceremonial. I think you're right and I also think that they're moving
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:18:01.980]  toward much bigger things beyond that if the UN has the power to tell us what to
[02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:11.420]  do or the government what to do and they decide that all Americans who have
[02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:17.340]  vehicles under let's say more than 10 years old they have to be junked and I
[02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:24.420]  have to buy new ones or everybody who has small arms in the United States has to
[02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:28.500]  give them to the government along with the ammunition and and on and on and
[02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:37.700]  that's how they intend to override the U.S. Congress the office of the
[02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:42.180]  presidency and do exactly what they want because I think up until this point
[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:47.100]  they've not been able to do it or find an easier way to do it so here they are
[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:51.740]  decreeing it. That's right they're going exactly they're going right to tyranny
[02:18:51.740 --> 02:18:56.380]  now right to agenda 21 and what you mentioned the UN has said in their
[02:18:56.380 --> 02:19:00.620]  unidire documents that they want total civilian man of guns they've said all
[02:19:00.620 --> 02:19:05.740]  the things you're saying and look at how he uses the EPA to enforce UN edicts
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:12.980]  we're already under UN control to a great extent. That's been born out as
[02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:23.500]  well by having the rules from country to country about things the same such as
[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:30.180]  contents how they're spelled out whether they're in ounces and things like that
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:35.580]  particularly in pertaining to food and they're working very diligently at that
[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:39.660]  have been for the last several years and so those are the kind of things they
[02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:48.060]  start with and then all of a sudden they say all cars have to be made like the
[02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:53.820]  Volkswagen whatchamacallit. Stay there you're absolutely right. The UN did the
[02:19:53.820 --> 02:19:58.620]  lightbulb bandits the smoking bandits is a UN treaty all over the world we just

[02:25:13.700 --> 02:25:16.460]  articles admitting it but they think it's good though it's like well this is
[02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:20.140]  good the incident occurred when members of the group defend live peacefully

[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:36.180]  roads folks but they tricked the cops into thinking it's everything they think
[02:25:36.180 --> 02:25:39.860]  you have to a permit for a gun too and would be arrested unless they packed up
[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:43.820]  and left when asked what specific ordinance the demonstrators needed a
[02:25:43.820 --> 02:25:48.420]  permit to protest one officer responded I'm not giving it to you at 5 o'clock at

[02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:44.300]  because I know how they're trying to destroy America officer I've got the data
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:48.940]  I want you to live in a free country too so stop your first its intimidation then
[02:26:48.940 --> 02:26:52.300]  it's laugh at me why don't you just be an American I know a bunch of crooks run
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:56.620]  the country government but can't you be smart enough to not be mad at some
[02:26:56.620 --> 02:27:01.820]  pro-lifers and just I'm sorry I'm ranting Bob Chapman but it there are
[02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:07.220]  some good signs happening the TSA had a video blocked exposing them there was
[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:12.220]  outcry and the video got put back up yesterday so we are seeing victories Bob
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:19.060]  Chapman yes we are and when you see those kinds of things happen to people when
[02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:23.220]  they dragged out to jail and we're going to jail is one thing it's certainly
[02:27:23.220 --> 02:27:33.260]  intimidating I know I've been there and but what is worse is the metal turmoil
[02:27:33.260 --> 02:27:38.940]  and the scars that you're putting on the people it's pure terrorism there's no
[02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:45.020]  better word for it and they're trying to terrorize the public into allowing them
[02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:50.980]  law enforcement military whatever to tell you what to do how to do it whether
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:55.180]  you like it or not whether it's a law or not and if you argue down to the
[02:27:55.180 --> 02:28:01.220]  dungeon and you're naked and this is a kind of tactics that they're taught in
[02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:08.420]  order to make people submissive and they beta tested it all on pro-lifers I've
[02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:12.820]  got the film in my martial law documentary where they would break
[02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:17.780]  pro-lifers arms for just sitting on the sidewalk and call it pain compliance
[02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:21.900]  hardcore life-threatening torture but it's not torture because they call it
[02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:27.980]  pain compliance Bob yeah reminds me of the Federal Reserve saying we're going
[02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:32.060]  to have a currency swap swap with the European Central back when in
[02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:39.260]  fact it's a loan and it's illegal from both ends at the same nomenclature the
[02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:45.580]  changing of terms the the pseudo-intellectuality of it all well that's
[02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:49.940]  like the state police called like five different people the day before we went
[02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:52.420]  down to cover them they must have our phones tapped or something with these
[02:28:52.420 --> 02:28:55.940]  gunboats they've got and I kept talking to different members and they kept the
[02:28:55.940 --> 02:28:58.980]  state police kept calling going Alex Jones isn't on the air on the station is
[02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:02.540]  he he's a liar you need to do something they're like no he's on the radio here
[02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:06.300]  but technically he doesn't work there well no well good and my guys get there
[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:10.100]  to interview and they're like you're a liar you're not on KLBJ you don't work
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:14.900]  there and it was like some weird game to like make us bad and say we're liars
[02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:23.460]  because we want to cover them getting all these machine gunboats just bizarre
[02:29:23.460 --> 02:29:26.540]  how they operate stay there Bob I want to get into the economy where it's going
[02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:30.540]  what you think people should do to try to get this impeachment going against
[02:29:30.540 --> 02:29:36.500]  Obama because I was always saying Obama's a puppet but now he has been given
[02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:40.180]  dictator power it's illegitimate but he's actually taking it and to go in and
[02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:45.220]  slap the senators around man they must have some dirt on them wow I want to get
[02:29:45.220 --> 02:29:49.220]  Bob's take on that the day mustane things coming up also tell you about well

[02:30:02.820 --> 02:30:06.820]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:10.620]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:14.980]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:30:14.980 --> 02:30:19.180]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[02:30:19.180 --> 02:30:23.180]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:27.180]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:31.300]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[02:30:31.300 --> 02:30:35.260]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their

[02:34:29.220 --> 02:34:33.940]  and again next time they do it we won't be a shocked but I'm gonna get to all
[02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:38.860]  that in a moment Dave Mustaine one of the founders of course Metallica and
[02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:45.420]  then mega death rock royalty is a Christian a patriot a listener of this
[02:34:45.420 --> 02:34:49.060]  show his wife is another great person Pam talked her on the phone a lot but
[02:34:49.060 --> 02:34:52.380]  never met her in person you met Dave in person before was really great spending
[02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:56.340]  a couple days with him here in Austin when they ended the latest leg of their
[02:34:56.340 --> 02:35:02.060]  gen gigantor tur with motorhead and I've done some sit-down interviews with him
[02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:06.220]  before I've done a lot of radio interviews with him over the years one
[02:35:06.220 --> 02:35:10.180]  time I called up to get him on as a guest and found out he was already a
[02:35:10.180 --> 02:35:12.660]  listener that's how we were able to get him like five six years ago on the show
[02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:17.020]  so he's been awake to a lot of what's going on for a very long time we've got
[02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:24.060]  a an extremely powerful in-depth interview with Dave Mustaine that I'm
[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:28.220]  gonna air next week on the nightly news and I'll air excerpts of it the next day
[02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:32.820]  here on the radio I haven't decided I might air it first on the radio slash TV
[02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:39.500]  we'll see what we do but next Thursday it will air and so all of that is coming
[02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:45.280]  up let's go ahead and go to this little teaser piece that'll be posted at
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:49.340]  info wars.com within the hour here it is
[02:35:56.100 --> 02:36:00.140]  something that everybody should aspire to do to make a contribution to this
[02:36:00.140 --> 02:36:04.420]  great nation for the good of everybody and if you don't know the difference
[02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:10.260]  between what's what's right and what's wrong it's just open your mind up
[02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:16.380]  Dave Mustaine like you've never seen before on info wars.com exclusive special
[02:36:16.380 --> 02:36:20.580]  report we had people die in Castle Donnington we had people die when we
[02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:29.020]  did rock and reo I went out there I showed up in a neck brace you know and
[02:36:29.020 --> 02:36:32.180]  everybody's there going like oh my god what's happening what's happening I said
[02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:38.700]  well so-and-so call me this and you know I just want to show him that he's that
[02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:41.900]  I don't want to play with any satanic bands I'll play with bands that have
[02:36:41.900 --> 02:36:44.820]  darkness in them because we all have a little darkness in us or we wouldn't be
[02:36:44.820 --> 02:36:51.180]  human but guys that are confessed satanists and you know it's don't
[02:36:51.180 --> 02:36:54.080]  only have time for that
[02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:58.380]  I can't take any credit for James's songwriting ability or his guitar
[02:36:58.380 --> 02:37:01.700]  playing he blew my mind when he picked up the guitar the first time because he
[02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:05.580]  used to just sing and I did all the guitar playing and and in fact I talked
[02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:09.020]  between every song to him and we picked up the guitar the first time I remember
[02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:13.500]  watching him I was like oh my god this guy's really really good and in fact it
[02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:17.100]  it almost intimidated me
[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:22.660]  you know the road got smooth and and my careers turned around I've got my best
[02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:26.700]  friend back playing bass with me my kids like me you know traffic's gotten better
[02:37:26.700 --> 02:37:30.780]  you know it's just a whole complete paradigm shift and the universe plays
[02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:36.620]  before you it's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll that's right
[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:53.780]  coming to the info war next Thursday
[02:37:53.780 --> 02:38:01.260]  all right there you go and we're gonna put that out very very soon on info
[02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:06.260]  wars calm in the next hour or so but it is an in-depth interview he talks about
[02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:10.020]  Metallica and other things that he's never never discussed before he said a
[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:13.620]  lot of it has never before been heard and I'm like wow you're gonna tell me all
[02:38:13.620 --> 02:38:17.940]  this so that's coming out and it'll definitely make the news and he's got
[02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:20.420]  some political stuff in there as well you know his whole Santorum thing was
[02:38:20.420 --> 02:38:26.940]  taken out of context he responds to that as well you know I tell you Bob freedom
[02:38:26.940 --> 02:38:32.460]  is getting more and more popular again I don't do this to brag about myself neither
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:35.820]  to you when you talk about all the context you get most of them off record
[02:38:35.820 --> 02:38:40.260]  but when I was when I go to a rock concert now you know just three years
[02:38:40.260 --> 02:38:44.700]  ago I go to rock concert maybe every ten people would stop me I went behind the
[02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:47.740]  scenes and like the roadies for three different bands like half of them were
[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:51.780]  listeners I heard the show today and then I was out in the crowd and like every
[02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:58.020]  third person was a listener it was just incredible I mean liberty is getting
[02:38:58.020 --> 02:39:00.940]  popular I think that's why the globalists are trying to accelerate their
[02:39:00.940 --> 02:39:07.900]  whole program as you said Alex we're breathing down their neck and I don't
[02:39:07.900 --> 02:39:13.460]  know what to do about it they're losing the info war and we just keep got to keep
[02:39:13.460 --> 02:39:20.900]  on hammering away until we break them down and take them over and take over
[02:39:20.900 --> 02:39:24.260]  the financial system so they can't do what they're doing and using it as a
[02:39:24.260 --> 02:39:30.540]  base of power you know what I'm worried about Bob is them trying to stage a
[02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:34.780]  false flag I really see that being one of the only ace cards they've got right
[02:39:34.780 --> 02:39:40.900]  now and you're right and there's very little we can do to control that unless
[02:39:40.900 --> 02:39:45.300]  we find out about it ahead of time and I don't know whether we can do that or
[02:39:45.300 --> 02:39:51.740]  not I want to get into the technicals on the economy what's going on with
[02:39:51.740 --> 02:39:56.020]  gold and silver other commodities going up like oil what's happening in the in
[02:39:56.020 --> 02:40:01.420]  the euro what's the latest development since we talked well it's supposedly the
[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:06.420]  price of oil is selling where it's at because of the disruptions in the
[02:40:06.420 --> 02:40:11.220]  Middle East which have been caused by the United States government and others
[02:40:11.220 --> 02:40:17.220]  in imboguing the usage of the financial system as well as the sale of the oil
[02:40:17.220 --> 02:40:24.660]  of Iran and Iran sells their oil now and currencies other than dollars and you're
[02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:32.260]  into the same fight over the petrodollar as you were with Gaddafi saying I want a
[02:40:32.260 --> 02:40:42.820]  golden dinar or Saddam Hussein who said I'm going to sell oil and non-dollar
[02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:46.540]  currencies and he did for a couple of years and he ended up at the end of the
[02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:53.180]  rope these people are vicious animals and they're going to continue to press
[02:40:53.180 --> 02:41:01.180]  and press and press and I think really if they can pull it off what you're
[02:41:01.180 --> 02:41:08.980]  afraid of the false false flag operation and would be something if they
[02:41:08.980 --> 02:41:16.700]  don't screw it up that could really impress upon people that they need
[02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:26.100]  government and so hopefully they can't pull that off what's the big big trigger
[02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:29.140]  you're looking for in the economy that could accelerate the collapse more and
[02:41:29.140 --> 02:41:35.100]  more of the system is admitting that we're really in a depression but that
[02:41:35.100 --> 02:41:37.420]  well you know the Federal Reserve's come out and said we're headed towards the
[02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:43.220]  edge of that cliff well of course they put us on that trajectory well that's
[02:41:43.220 --> 02:41:50.580]  right and I think the catalyst although it seems mundane after several years is
[02:41:50.580 --> 02:41:58.260]  going to be Europe this deal that was made today which refinances the bales
[02:41:58.260 --> 02:42:06.700]  out again a grease is a loser in January revenues were up like four and a half
[02:42:06.700 --> 02:42:15.340]  percent for the government and spending was up plus eight and a half percent so
[02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:18.780]  they're not making any headway and they're not going to make any headway
[02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:22.820]  and they don't care about making headway and so that deal is going to fall
[02:42:22.820 --> 02:42:27.460]  asunder and they know that and the very important thing to happen last week is
[02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:34.260]  in Karlsruhe Germany the Federal District Court Federal National Court I'll
[02:42:34.260 --> 02:42:41.220]  call it that rather than go into German they said that this new vehicle to
[02:42:41.220 --> 02:42:49.420]  finance these financially unsound countries which had previously been
[02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:57.380]  under something called the EFSF the Germans and others one of you this new
[02:42:57.380 --> 02:43:06.340]  uses new ESM in order to do that by rolling EFSF into ESM they can't do it
[02:43:06.340 --> 02:43:13.740]  the German court says that is illegal under the Constitution so they they
[02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:19.900]  have to pass an amendment or something or they're not going to be able to allocate
[02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:26.820]  funds to ESM and of course part of ESM was even more austerity I mean don't
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:31.620]  the Germans think for one second when you have austerity down the road the
[02:43:31.620 --> 02:43:38.700]  people who you're exporting to that they're going to have less of an economy
[02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:44.020]  because of the austerity and that means you're not going to be able to export as
[02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:49.820]  much to them as you did before which means their economy is going down there's
[02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:57.100]  a chain reaction going down exactly all right so that that is a nightmare believe
[02:43:57.100 --> 02:44:02.020]  me they're no closer now than they were three years ago all right I want to shift
[02:44:02.020 --> 02:44:06.780]  gears into county 2012 and just a minute and get your take on this I'm gonna give
[02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:12.260]  you a briefing here Bob and get your analysis on it but first I want to just
[02:44:12.260 --> 02:44:18.820]  ask you briefly what you think we should do to try to resist this open UN
[02:44:18.820 --> 02:44:23.780]  Pentagon globalist banker coup d'etat I mean they admit in Time magazine that
[02:44:23.780 --> 02:44:28.820]  it's a banker coup you know here's the article regime change in Europe do
[02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:31.860]  recently amount to a banker's coup and they say yes but the bankers know how to
[02:44:31.860 --> 02:44:38.220]  run it congressman Walter Jones and senators have introduced the H con res
[02:44:38.220 --> 02:44:44.940]  107 or house res 107 and they say it's a high crime and that if he doesn't
[02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:50.020]  reverse himself they're gonna initiate impeachment well that that needs to
[02:44:50.020 --> 02:44:52.700]  happen when Congress said you got to get permission for Libyan he said no I have
[02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:57.940]  the UN just cuz some just cuz the Pentagon came in and disgraced you
[02:44:57.940 --> 02:45:03.180]  you're already disgraced yourself passing the NDAA you already so so yeah if
[02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:06.660]  you want to come to your senses of course they came in in front of the world
[02:45:06.660 --> 02:45:11.380]  said Congress has no authority and a ceremonial just like Caesar did in 49
[02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:17.180]  BC but I think everybody should call the Judiciary Committee over impeachment and
[02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:21.660]  say look the whole world knows what's going on here you either tell those
[02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:26.060]  traders over at the Pentagon because the military's waking up that they better
[02:45:26.060 --> 02:45:28.980]  come out and say yes our commander-in-chief is the president during
[02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:32.380]  war and Congress is in charge the president I want to hear that chain of
[02:45:32.380 --> 02:45:36.100]  command right now or this is a coup that's been successful this is a big
[02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:39.420]  deal we can't just take this sitting down we've been trained to accept so much
[02:45:39.420 --> 02:45:43.940]  nobody put up with this coos are one thing but foreign coups through puppets
[02:45:43.940 --> 02:45:48.540]  nobody puts up with that you think Mexico would put up with the president
[02:45:48.540 --> 02:45:52.380]  openly saying he takes his orders from the US even if it's true that the big
[02:45:52.380 --> 02:45:54.660]  banks give them what I mean they would riot in a minute and overthrow the
[02:45:54.660 --> 02:45:58.180]  government the police and military would walk out and that's a third-world
[02:45:58.180 --> 02:46:04.140]  police state I mean did you do we have any basic honor anything here's the
[02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:12.500]  number 202-225-3951 202-225-3951 Judiciary Committee Lamar Smith's the head of
[02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:19.220]  it 202-225-4236 call the general switchboard if you want but the point
[02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:23.140]  is we need to take action on this now I mean what else can we do Bob I guess get
[02:46:23.140 --> 02:46:28.340]  the articles off info wars calm out to everybody coup day top Pentagon Obama
[02:46:28.340 --> 02:46:33.340]  declare Congress ceremonial I mean what do you think we should do Bob well all
[02:46:33.340 --> 02:46:39.220]  the people who are on the air such as myself should put the word out of course
[02:46:39.220 --> 02:46:44.140]  and all of you people who are blogging on the internet you should do the same
[02:46:44.140 --> 02:46:49.300]  thing and all you people out there give encouragement to these people who step
[02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:56.660]  forward and expose what's being done here and also it doesn't hurt a short note
[02:46:56.660 --> 02:47:03.020]  to every congressman and just tell them we know what you're doing and we want
[02:47:03.020 --> 02:47:10.020]  that reversed and because it's unconstitutional and if you don't you
[02:47:10.020 --> 02:47:16.980]  gonna have an awful lot of people mad at you very well said all right now on
[02:47:16.980 --> 02:47:22.540]  this next subject I have done research over the years on the Lord's
[02:47:22.540 --> 02:47:29.540]  Resistance Army in Uganda and the general Congonese Congo area and I've
[02:47:29.540 --> 02:47:34.180]  interviewed political scientist experts on the subject is to double check my
[02:47:34.180 --> 02:47:41.180]  research and I'm not saying that Joseph Coney is a good guy but he has a few
[02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:47.580]  thousand followers maybe 500 ragtag troops he does use child soldiers because
[02:47:47.580 --> 02:47:50.740]  in the area the kids just starve so it's always been that way in Africa many
[02:47:50.740 --> 02:47:55.940]  other you know areas that are primitive in their technological development the
[02:47:55.940 --> 02:47:59.860]  kids either star more they're brought in and trained as a soldiers I mean in the
[02:47:59.860 --> 02:48:03.260]  old days they had nine-year-olds they would grab off the streets in England
[02:48:03.260 --> 02:48:07.460]  and force into military service I mean that's that's as old as civilization
[02:48:07.460 --> 02:48:12.180]  when civilization was more primitive I the point is is that Bill and Melinda
[02:48:12.180 --> 02:48:17.060]  Gates Foundation all of them Kim Kardashian all these Hollywood people
[02:48:17.060 --> 02:48:21.500]  George Clooney are behind this Coney 2012 and the symbol is a donkey and
[02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:24.980]  elephant together saying one thing we can all agree on well this is what we
[02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:32.340]  predicted in the Obama deception it is a African invasion of Africa the beach
[02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:37.500]  head and Libya murdering mass murder there destabilization using al-Qaeda the
[02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:42.620]  current leader of Uganda was connected in the last 20 years to other groups that
[02:48:42.620 --> 02:48:46.980]  have been involved in more than 7 million killed so they're literally
[02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:50.900]  comparing him to Hitler this new guy Coney who's like a nobody like a
[02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:54.460]  Beverly Hillbilly or something they've got Hitler next to bin Laden next to
[02:48:54.460 --> 02:48:59.340]  Coney he's the new Hitler and this video's gotten 50 million views in five
[02:48:59.340 --> 02:49:03.340]  days it's being promoted by every globalist outfit Bill Gates is promoting
[02:49:03.340 --> 02:49:07.300]  it who openly says he wants to reduce the population of Africa and all the and
[02:49:07.300 --> 02:49:10.220]  they're targeting school kids and they're and they're flooding us saying
[02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:14.340]  you've got to stand for the children they're being kidnapped by Coney and
[02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:20.100]  and turn into military minions well that's standard all across the entire
[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:24.220]  continent and goes on to many other contests but the point is it's purely in
[02:49:24.220 --> 02:49:28.140]  fact they say in these news reports they wanted to make him the villain they
[02:49:28.140 --> 02:49:31.660]  don't even hide that so it's just like they use Remington's paintings to claim
[02:49:31.660 --> 02:49:37.020]  the Spanish were slaughtering people in Cuba in 1898 and you know the head of
[02:49:37.020 --> 02:49:43.100]  Hearst Publishing said give me the the the images I'll give you a war so this
[02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:48.100]  is pure war propaganda and they've now got the whole anti-war left calling for
[02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:52.020]  war in Libya calling for it in Syria calling for it in Iran and calling for a
[02:49:52.020 --> 02:49:57.300]  AFRICOM invasion by US forces as Tarpley predicted three and a half years ago in
[02:49:57.300 --> 02:50:02.500]  Obama deception in the Congo wide area and you watch there's this gets kicked
[02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:07.100]  off genocide and I'll have to have trendies lecturing me on how great they
[02:50:07.100 --> 02:50:12.020]  are cuz they're gonna get some little ragtag guy in one tiny area who's a
[02:50:12.020 --> 02:50:17.220]  joke I mean it's just they go here's the bad man invade people are like kill I
[02:50:17.220 --> 02:50:20.980]  mean it's like Saddam and the baby incubators it's I'm gonna come back from
[02:50:20.980 --> 02:50:25.940]  break and get Bob's take on this but people kept calling me about this last
[02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:32.540]  two days I looked into it and they're targeting 10 12 13 14 year olds and
[02:50:32.540 --> 02:50:36.020]  they've got all these little kids spamming the web with it people crying and
[02:50:36.020 --> 02:50:40.780]  getting donations for money for the UN just like they had blood diamond movies
[02:50:40.780 --> 02:50:43.740]  about there's African countries where they mind their own diamonds they have
[02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:48.380]  child labor it's the UN and deburrers that's running around enslaving people
[02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:52.860]  and doing all this and a blood diamonds of money that the Rothschilds don't get
[02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:57.740]  I mean literally they use this humanitarian cover it's pure propaganda
[02:50:57.740 --> 02:51:01.460]  the West wants Africans dead and this will be the pretext to go in there and

[02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:36.100]  Criminal Court anybody that resists the New World Order they had the other five
[02:54:36.100 --> 02:54:40.540]  nation group of commandos led by the US try to go in and kill this guy just
[02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:45.060]  because he's one little resistor and now he's being used as the poster boy to
[02:54:45.060 --> 02:54:49.580]  have full-on invasion against all sorts of others liking Muslim and Christian on
[02:54:49.580 --> 02:54:54.740]  both sides and even animus to invade the whole area Bob Chapman I mean we've got
[02:54:54.740 --> 02:54:58.420]  the West that loves killing a million Iraqis loves doing all this and now we
[02:54:58.420 --> 02:55:05.660]  have Kim Kardashian all the big liberals and George Clooney with Bill Gates and I
[02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:10.660]  noticed on YouTube and people got snapshots of this within a lifetime it
[02:55:10.660 --> 02:55:13.620]  went up like a million views in an hour when they launched it five days ago
[02:55:13.620 --> 02:55:16.260]  well everybody knows even when we've had stuff with hundreds of thousands of
[02:55:16.260 --> 02:55:21.140]  views or anybody else it says 301 or 306 while it caches than waits half a day
[02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:24.500]  before the numbers start updating but you can always tell when it's a see
[02:55:24.500 --> 02:55:28.180]  probably hasn't had 50 million views I mean YouTube is heavily involved with
[02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:32.700]  Obama Google that owns it is what's your take on them inventing a new boogie man
[02:55:32.700 --> 02:55:38.740]  and saying he's Hitler he's been laden we've now got to invade Africa well there's
[02:55:38.740 --> 02:55:44.900]  a long history of this especially after the years which began the
[02:55:44.900 --> 02:55:53.020]  decolonization of Africa and I lived in Africa for several years mostly in
[02:55:53.020 --> 02:55:57.580]  southern Africa which would be South Africa and Rodisha which is now Zimbabwe
[02:55:57.580 --> 02:56:03.500]  and I spent a lot of time in Mozambique and Angola Zambia which used to be
[02:56:03.500 --> 02:56:11.260]  northern Rodisha but as you say there aren't many jobs around and it's pretty
[02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:22.180]  easy to recruit people to get involved in wars or disruptions and they don't care
[02:56:22.180 --> 02:56:28.700]  whether they get killed or not they get really very little to live for and that's
[02:56:28.700 --> 02:56:33.220]  what's going on for a long time but the bottom line here is it usually what has
[02:56:33.220 --> 02:56:42.140]  happened is an outside group like BP or Exxon or De Beers or whatever they're
[02:56:42.140 --> 02:56:46.380]  behind the whole thing and they take a fellow like the one you've been
[02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:50.820]  mentioning and they round up a bunch of people for them and give them guns and
[02:56:50.820 --> 02:56:57.180]  say go out in that direction up there and and raise heck and because you're
[02:56:57.180 --> 02:57:01.460]  supposed to do that and and they do it well let me expand on this we're not
[02:57:01.460 --> 02:57:06.580]  even saying that this Coney guy's a good guy he's literally a nobody out there
[02:57:06.580 --> 02:57:12.300]  it's an excuse to bring in african and this huge US global buildup for a new
[02:57:12.300 --> 02:57:17.740]  colonialism publicly and they've got the left now who usually is anti-war but
[02:57:17.740 --> 02:57:25.460]  it's been silent is cheering for war and they could care less about the children
[02:57:25.460 --> 02:57:31.380]  it's all the invisible children oh Coney's like Hitler oh we care so much and
[02:57:31.380 --> 02:57:36.540]  it's all about selling people on going in and carrying out globalist eugenics
[02:57:36.540 --> 02:57:41.540]  in Africa mean Bill Gates has said he wants some dead and and and it's Bill
[02:57:41.540 --> 02:57:48.020]  Gates I mean it is sick isn't that sick Bob it certainly is and you know those
[02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:53.180]  poor people have enough problems just surviving and I know I had a business
[02:57:53.180 --> 02:57:57.140]  there we had 300 people working for us and I didn't even need half the people
[02:57:57.140 --> 02:58:02.980]  I saw I had them just so they have a job what was funny is every once in a while
[02:58:02.980 --> 02:58:08.980]  one would disappear and about two or three months later he'd come back and I
[02:58:08.980 --> 02:58:13.940]  you'd say I'm ready for work boss and I said really well you've been he's
[02:58:13.940 --> 02:58:20.060]  out in the tribal trust land I said well I don't have any place for you right
[02:58:20.060 --> 02:58:25.100]  now what did you go away and come back he said oh it was time for me to see my
[02:58:25.100 --> 02:58:31.260]  wife so this is a kind of mentality that you're dealing with it's very
[02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:38.980]  rudimentary it's too bad but that's the way it is and that's how they
[02:58:38.980 --> 02:58:56.940]  refer to that yeah that's what's going on
