[00:00.000 --> 00:23.760]  Well, there is a big new study out from SIGNA saying that loneliness and depression are
[00:23.760 --> 00:25.280]  at epidemic levels.
[00:25.280 --> 00:30.000]  No kidding, we'll break down exactly why that's happening and where this trend goes if it's
[00:30.000 --> 00:33.400]  not reversed and how this is by design.
[00:33.400 --> 00:35.800]  We're going to lay all that out.
[00:35.800 --> 00:41.920]  Pat Buchanan has blasted Benjamin Netanyahu pointing out that he's cried wolf about Iran
[00:41.920 --> 00:42.920]  for decades.
[00:42.920 --> 00:48.000]  We're going to get to some of the crying wolf over the decades, but also Pat Buchanan's
[00:48.000 --> 00:55.120]  response of the latest on Mueller, the rogue government, disgraced mad dog and so much more
[00:55.120 --> 00:56.120]  today.
[00:56.120 --> 00:59.960]  Our reporters are on the ground as the invader caravan arrives in California.
[00:59.960 --> 01:06.440]  But first, how did we know about the Korean deal before anybody else, looking out on the
[01:06.440 --> 01:09.440]  North Korean peninsula?
[01:09.440 --> 01:14.460]  And I can tell you exactly why peace is breaking out, but simply put, there's a new sheriff
[01:14.460 --> 01:23.920]  in town and the globalist with China have specifically wanted a strategy of tension
[01:23.920 --> 01:31.720]  in the South China Sea as a pretext to move globalist forces into the area and as a pretext
[01:31.720 --> 01:38.080]  for China to have a diversion anytime they want it.
[01:38.080 --> 01:42.040]  And Trump does not want to continue to have the strategy of patience or the strategy of
[01:42.040 --> 01:44.520]  tension and these massive alien things.
[01:44.520 --> 01:46.360]  He wants stability and trade.
[01:46.360 --> 01:50.400]  And so massive pressure has been brought to bear right to the edge of a major trade war
[01:50.400 --> 01:58.840]  with China, huge sanctions on North Korea that actually squeezed Kim Jong-un, the sickening
[01:58.840 --> 02:00.680]  creature.
[02:00.680 --> 02:06.560]  And he is also wanting to be on the world stage, so he wants to meet with Trump.
[02:06.560 --> 02:12.920]  And the plans and discussions have been going on for decades in the 60-plus year conflict
[02:12.920 --> 02:19.360]  that has never been ended, the war is still ongoing to have a armistice turn into a peace
[02:19.360 --> 02:24.520]  deal and then turn into a 10-year plan to begin partial reunification between the North
[02:24.520 --> 02:25.520]  and South.
[02:25.520 --> 02:32.080]  Now, back on March 8th, I told you that the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, suing
[02:32.080 --> 02:38.480]  for peace, reaching out and saying, I want to meet face to face with President Trump.
[02:38.480 --> 02:45.560]  The big takeaway here is when those top government envoys and the South Korean intelligence chief
[02:45.560 --> 02:50.880]  met with Kim Jong-un last week for four hours at dinner, I have from high-level sources
[02:50.880 --> 02:58.080]  that they laid out the proposals for the North invading nuclear eyes and actually about to
[02:58.080 --> 03:03.280]  stop the militaristic activities, and the South also offered a plan to begin a 10-year program
[03:03.280 --> 03:04.280]  of reunification.
[03:04.280 --> 03:09.880]  But the Communist Party basically has to stand down and fade out and just become Robert Barrett's
[03:09.880 --> 03:10.880]  over the incredible wealth.
[03:10.880 --> 03:16.760]  Their people won't be starving to death anyway, but this is a transfer, a segue, a stepping
[03:16.760 --> 03:22.320]  stone out of the most abject, hellish place in not just modern history, but in world history
[03:22.320 --> 03:24.120]  many analysts believe.
[03:24.120 --> 03:30.480]  So here's the statement, Kim Jong-un has already tacitly agreed to the terms of the
[03:30.480 --> 03:31.480]  Trump meeting.
[03:31.480 --> 03:35.440]  Trump's not going to go to that meeting without getting an agreement and without having
[03:35.440 --> 03:36.440]  a mean ironclad.
[03:36.440 --> 03:38.880]  He's not going to go there and not have the victory.
[03:38.880 --> 03:45.280]  Okay, so I'm going to explain this, the meeting already happened last week, after all the diplomatic
[03:45.280 --> 03:51.080]  and military pressure, and you heard it here first, you'll guarantee, the mother-in-law
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.880]  that this happens, it's going to come out, that Trump already has the agreement.
[03:55.880 --> 03:59.680]  Now does that mean Kim Jong-un might not try to back out or do something?
[03:59.680 --> 04:00.680]  Who knows?
[04:00.680 --> 04:03.680]  But this is a big day, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:03.680 --> 04:07.280]  The truth is, the Clintons and others gave them the reactors, gave them the missile secrets
[04:07.280 --> 04:09.680]  to build up as a threat working with China.
[04:09.680 --> 04:12.720]  The globalists have been allied with China against America playing a double game.
[04:12.720 --> 04:16.280]  Trump is ending that double game, because when you went to Saudi Arabia and said, you're
[04:16.280 --> 04:19.440]  not going to fund ISIS anymore, you're not going to fund al-Qaeda, you're going to free
[04:19.440 --> 04:27.880]  women, and they rolled over because the U.S. and Britain had put the Saudis in power, Britain
[04:27.880 --> 04:31.920]  particularly, and then the U.S. took that roll over in the 50s, goes back to the war
[04:31.920 --> 04:32.920]  with Arabia.
[04:32.920 --> 04:38.920]  We had evil people in control, basically, funding radical Islam and protecting it and
[04:38.920 --> 04:39.920]  letting it do what it did.
[04:39.920 --> 04:40.920]  Trump's a pragmatist.
[04:40.920 --> 04:42.920]  He said, this is all over.
[04:42.920 --> 04:48.000]  Now, weeks later, word for word, it came out what I said, and it's not about tooting
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.440]  our horn, it's just the fact that we do have great sources, and we were reporting on something
[04:55.440 --> 05:00.560]  very, very positive, that at least so far as getting to the meeting table.

[06:24.000 --> 06:46.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to crystallize for you in just a few minutes.
[06:46.800 --> 06:57.080]  I am going to boil down how Islam has already basically captured Europe and how it plans
[06:57.080 --> 07:00.480]  to capture the United States.
[07:00.480 --> 07:04.040]  That is coming up here in just a few minutes.
[07:04.040 --> 07:11.080]  And so the time frame is so incredibly dire, it's why the left has allied itself with Islam.
[07:11.080 --> 07:13.000]  That is coming up.
[07:13.000 --> 07:22.400]  Then, Pat Buchanan has come out and blasted Benjamin Yatniahou and said that he's been
[07:22.400 --> 07:31.280]  crying wolf for a long time, for decades, and he then provides examples that we have
[07:31.280 --> 07:38.280]  in a zero-hedge article posted on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com that is very, very important.
[07:38.280 --> 07:44.440]  I want to be clear, I'm not anti-Israel, I am anti-war.
[07:44.440 --> 07:47.640]  And I understand Israel and Iran don't like each other.
[07:47.640 --> 07:52.840]  I realize that Israel and Saudi Arabia don't like Iran.
[07:52.840 --> 07:56.000]  But I have to say Saudi Arabia is the greater threat.
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.160]  It's Saudi Arabia that is colonizing Europe.
[07:58.160 --> 08:03.320]  It's Saudi Arabia that with the globalist is running the Islamification of the planet
[08:03.320 --> 08:09.800]  and the Arab Spring destroyed the borders of Muslim nations bordering Europe so they
[08:09.800 --> 08:13.960]  could be zones of invasion.
[08:13.960 --> 08:23.640]  So all of this Iran and the situation with Israel and Saudi Arabia and BB, Netanyahu,
[08:23.640 --> 08:25.840]  all of it ties together.
[08:25.840 --> 08:31.480]  So I'm going to lay that out here right now.
[08:31.480 --> 08:36.240]  Here we've got the latest what Trump swams disgraceful Mueller over leaked questions.
[08:36.240 --> 08:38.800]  Mueller is completely rogue.
[08:38.800 --> 08:44.480]  We're also going to look at Kanye West seeks restraining order against rapper who called
[08:44.480 --> 08:50.920]  for Crips to fm up and basically called for a Crip hit.
[08:50.920 --> 08:54.080]  A Crip fatwa.
[08:54.080 --> 09:00.760]  I mean this guy again is just a completely moronic idiot clown with a moron pimp Snoop
[09:00.760 --> 09:07.880]  Dogg trying to virtue signal trying to threaten a free thinker.
[09:07.880 --> 09:11.600]  So let's say separate the boys from the men.
[09:11.600 --> 09:17.360]  This clown moron versus Kanye West who can actually run his own life and be successful
[09:17.360 --> 09:23.960]  and is just calling for free speech doesn't even support the Republican Party.
[09:23.960 --> 09:29.360]  So we're going to break all of that down also biblical bombshells.
[09:29.360 --> 09:38.800]  First uncover ancient city of King David continuing to confirm the Old Testament's accuracy
[09:38.800 --> 09:44.080]  and will continue Dana citizen first person convicted under Malaysian anti fake news law
[09:44.080 --> 09:48.760]  jailed one week and find and of course the government will decide what's fake news.
[09:48.760 --> 09:53.360]  That's all coming up today.
[09:53.360 --> 10:04.160]  But let me get into first how Islam has basically already conquered Western Europe unless something's
[10:04.160 --> 10:11.560]  done now and that was the stated United Nations plan to do this politically decades ago under
[10:11.560 --> 10:12.560]  Peter Sutherland.
[10:12.560 --> 10:19.120]  There was even older plan to that as well and it's now been done on explain the numbers
[10:19.120 --> 10:26.800]  to this but first Pat Buchanan blast BB he's been crying wolf for decades so bottom line
[10:26.800 --> 10:31.440]  Pat Buchanan says the Netanyahu is a liar.
[10:31.440 --> 10:36.320]  Well I don't think that's entirely fair because it's true that Iran had a nuclear program
[10:36.320 --> 10:43.640]  and it's true they haven't entirely frozen it but it's also true that they had admitted
[10:43.640 --> 10:49.920]  to the nuclear program previously and the Netanyahu cherry picked what he put in his
[10:49.920 --> 10:56.120]  presentation yesterday but why can Israel have thousands of nuclear weapons and Iran
[10:56.120 --> 10:59.640]  can't have any by the way I don't want to have a nuclear war.
[10:59.640 --> 11:03.040]  I don't like the moolas and Iran I don't like them threatening our ships I think they're
[11:03.040 --> 11:07.760]  very belligerent out of control but just because they're bad doesn't mean we need to start
[11:07.760 --> 11:14.560]  a new giant war but we're having a discussion about this right now and look how nice it
[11:14.560 --> 11:20.160]  is to have Trump being praised to get a Nobel Prize and things like that with Korea maybe
[11:20.160 --> 11:24.720]  we're just putting pressure BB and Trump on Iran to get them to do a better deal which
[11:24.720 --> 11:30.880]  I'm all for it is a bad deal Obama did so overall BB is telling the truth the problem
[11:30.880 --> 11:36.200]  is he's cried wolf before that part's true so when the real big bad wolf starts coming
[11:36.200 --> 11:40.880]  to town our folks can listen here's Pat you can in a few minutes of him on Sean Hannity
[11:40.880 --> 11:42.040]  yesterday.
[11:42.040 --> 11:48.040]  Exactly where the things are being done that they're where they've been cheating exactly
[11:48.040 --> 11:53.440]  where to go to and you know Pat he laid it out today and later who's gonna let him in
[11:53.440 --> 11:55.440]  who's gonna let the world in the IEA.
[11:55.440 --> 11:59.080]  We're gonna rely on a press conference by BB Netanyahu to go to war.
[11:59.080 --> 12:04.120]  I have more faith in BB Netanyahu than I do in the mollusks and Iran or the team the
[12:04.120 --> 12:08.760]  Barack Obama put together what you know you have to be pretty stupid to hand Iranian
[12:08.760 --> 12:12.440]  mollusks that are chanting death to your country a hundred and fifty billion dollars
[12:12.440 --> 12:13.440]  it's pretty dumb.
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.000]  There would be more stupid Sean to be dragged into a war by.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.280]  Nobody's talking about he's putting Israel first.
[12:20.280 --> 12:26.240]  How about we get the inspections done and if the Iranians okay I want America I want
[12:26.240 --> 12:32.280]  American inspectors in BB laid out he laid out exactly where these programs are taking
[12:32.280 --> 12:37.680]  place some of them underground and to be honest the Israelis have approved some of
[12:37.680 --> 12:43.280]  the best intelligence in the world intelligence because they obviously missed totally what
[12:43.280 --> 12:50.800]  bitties found CIA, DIA, DNI everybody we relied upon or guys ought to be fired if that's true
[12:50.800 --> 12:55.200]  and people should be called before Congress Pat there's intelligence sharing conference
[12:55.200 --> 13:00.000]  by BB Netanyahu excuse me there's intelligence sharing now at a level we've never seen before
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.560]  between the Israelis, the Americans, Jordanians, Egyptians, even the Saudis and even the Emirates
[13:05.560 --> 13:11.080]  and they were and hang on and now all and the reason for this is because they live in
[13:11.080 --> 13:16.440]  that part of the world and they see the dangers of a nuclear armed Iran and Iranian hegemony
[13:16.440 --> 13:17.440]  in the region.
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.680]  We all see the danger of a nuclear armed okay but why did BB discover that our guys didn't
[13:22.680 --> 13:25.840]  and I got to let it go there I like a better one we're fighting.
[13:25.840 --> 13:37.600]  Now let's go to Benjamin Netanyahu in 2002 saying that Iraq imminently was gonna have
[13:37.600 --> 13:42.440]  these weapons which we now know was not true I've studied the issue Iran already has nuclear
[13:42.440 --> 13:46.120]  weapons atomic weapons they've had them for many years I was told a decade ago they have
[13:46.120 --> 13:53.200]  five weapons we know about so the shoe he puts on the foot of Iran saying they lie well
[13:53.200 --> 14:01.600]  you can also say he's lying but I don't think that's true I think he cried wolf in 2002
[14:01.600 --> 14:07.720]  did he know he was lying I don't know did Iran lie this time yes they've been lying
[14:07.720 --> 14:12.040]  about wanting a weapons program that's not true they've admitted it before so both sides
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.920]  are engaged in deception here by way of deception I'm sure Netanyahu knows what that means let's
[14:16.920 --> 14:26.880]  go ahead and go to a clip of a flashback the dangers posed by a nuclear arm Saddam were
[14:26.880 --> 14:33.360]  understood by my country two decades ago well before September 11th in 1981 the late prime
[14:33.360 --> 14:39.680]  minister of Israel Menachem Begin dispatched the Israeli Air Force on a pre-dawn raid
[14:39.680 --> 14:50.920]  that destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak this probably took place months away
[14:50.920 --> 14:59.320]  from Saddam's ability to assemble the critical mass of plutonium for the first atomic bomb
[14:59.320 --> 15:06.240]  or more than one so there you go and there's a whole bunch of these clips and it goes on
[15:06.240 --> 15:11.000]  and on and yes back then Iraq could have got a nuclear weapon but they weren't about to
[15:11.000 --> 15:18.680]  get it as he says in other videos from the same testimony in 2003 and we know that was
[15:18.680 --> 15:23.880]  bad and Trump knew that was bad and we took out a moderate who'd fought Iran and now
[15:23.880 --> 15:30.120]  have destabilized the entire Middle East now when we return I'm gonna document the sad
[15:30.120 --> 15:37.600]  fact that Europe has already been captured by Islam and I'm going to explain how in
[15:37.600 --> 15:45.800]  their own words on the other side I'm Alex Jones this is the info war the most attack

[19:03.680 --> 19:09.120]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate
[19:09.120 --> 19:15.520]  seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort
[19:15.520 --> 19:21.920]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[19:21.920 --> 19:27.680]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying
[19:27.680 --> 19:32.560]  this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research
[19:32.560 --> 19:38.560]  a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is
[19:38.560 --> 19:44.000]  natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.600]  actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and

[20:03.200 --> 20:09.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:09.440 --> 20:19.280]  you
[20:19.280 --> 20:39.120]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you right from the front lines of the info war
[20:39.760 --> 20:48.080]  i've been on the air 23 years and i have a lot of muslims that still walk up to me and shake my
[20:48.080 --> 20:54.960]  hand on the street or who still walk up and shake my hand at the shopping mall and they say we think
[20:54.960 --> 20:59.600]  you're a good man you know not all of us want to support terror and not all of us support
[21:00.720 --> 21:06.480]  the more radical forms of islam but you know sometimes you hurt our feelings
[21:08.480 --> 21:14.800]  i probably had 50 muslims in the last couple years from up to me now i was against the first
[21:14.800 --> 21:23.280]  iraq war i was against the second iraq war i was against the afghan invasion for the same
[21:23.280 --> 21:29.120]  reason donald trump was the two latter wars i understood that we were going in and taking out
[21:30.240 --> 21:35.920]  less radical groups and putting in more radical i understood the globalist wanted it for nation
[21:35.920 --> 21:45.760]  building to destabilize the middle east and then bring in a system of total control i knew that the
[21:45.760 --> 21:54.480]  un had plans going back decades to merge with the middle east and north africa the un through the EU
[21:58.160 --> 22:03.120]  but i never thought they would actually try to execute it or that europeans would put up with it
[22:03.120 --> 22:08.640]  or they would get away with it but now let me give you the demographic breakdown
[22:09.600 --> 22:18.320]  and the cultural and political breakdown of why i am 100 percent against organized islam now
[22:20.240 --> 22:26.400]  i wasn't for invading it i wasn't for attacking it but it was actually somewhat stable and not
[22:26.400 --> 22:33.440]  expanding like a cancer until the west went in and we now know that was on purpose part of a
[22:33.440 --> 22:38.400]  destabilization plan to then collapse it into europe just like they're destabilizing latin america
[22:38.400 --> 22:44.400]  to collapse it into north america central and south america this is all coordinated
[22:44.400 --> 22:54.400]  this is all admitted the un admits it and urgun of turkey admits it so
[22:57.280 --> 23:03.600]  the globalists the socialists have created a domino effect that they now already believe is
[23:03.600 --> 23:12.240]  irreversible but eastern europe in many countries is not taking one quote migrant from north africa
[23:12.240 --> 23:17.200]  or the middle east because they know they're not compatible they don't work they commit massive
[23:17.200 --> 23:25.920]  crime they are extremely caveman like and warlike and treat women like dogs they also attack people
[23:25.920 --> 23:34.000]  that own dogs you don't have dogs under islam you can't make this up so let me get into the heart
[23:34.000 --> 23:42.000]  of this right now this is not my opinion this is a fact the globalists were successful at taking
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.960]  over north africa and the middle east using radical islam through saudi arabia they controlled
[23:47.520 --> 23:51.840]  they were successful carrying out 9 11 to then take our rights away here domestically
[23:51.840 --> 23:55.760]  and then bring in the very islamist that have been heavily involved in terror
[23:57.280 --> 24:03.760]  and so let me explain this remember mit romney when he said 47 percent of people
[24:04.320 --> 24:09.360]  are going to vote democrat because they're on the dole soon it'll be above 50 and we'll lose every
[24:09.360 --> 24:15.760]  election they said oh you're a horrible person for saying that it's so hateful to the 47 percent of
[24:15.760 --> 24:21.760]  people that don't work that are dependent and they've made it that way i'm not blaming everybody
[24:21.760 --> 24:32.080]  that's on the dole but it was total truth now let me explain something that's 50 percent is now
[24:32.080 --> 24:36.160]  roughly on the dole it's reversed a little bit back to about 48 percent under trump
[24:36.160 --> 24:39.920]  but under obama in the last eight years it went to over 50
[24:41.120 --> 24:46.160]  hundreds of something million people on food stamps alone now here's the demographic key
[24:47.280 --> 24:52.240]  you can say well france is you know 20 muslim and england's 10 percent and
[24:54.800 --> 25:00.160]  Greece is 20 percent how is that going to take over it's not 50 50 like an election
[25:00.160 --> 25:07.520]  where we have a republican democratic party they have parliaments most countries have
[25:08.560 --> 25:16.560]  10 or more major parties like idly like the uk like germany merkel is a minority party
[25:17.440 --> 25:22.000]  but she's been in power so her groups control the money and she's got a coalition of other
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.640]  groups in parliament so it doesn't matter
[25:24.640 --> 25:31.440]  here that close to 50 percent of the germans don't want open borders they're able to finagle
[25:31.440 --> 25:33.920]  the parliamentary system and keep merkel in power
[25:36.160 --> 25:44.400]  so understand this they've already established islamic parties in every town and city and state
[25:44.400 --> 25:56.000]  and country of the EU in many areas the islam party is the strongest party because it's 20 percent
[25:57.440 --> 26:03.360]  it then allies itself with the greens and the left and the communist and it is becoming a
[26:03.360 --> 26:12.400]  majority coalition in every country from sweden to germany to the united kingdom game over they are
[26:12.400 --> 26:19.680]  now disproportionately in some areas 50 percent of the social workers police bureaucrats and
[26:19.680 --> 26:26.400]  officials are now muslims the mayors the police chiefs the border chiefs the intelligence heads
[26:29.680 --> 26:35.680]  the globalists have made the deal there's a billion 300 million muslims now they'll be
[26:35.680 --> 26:43.680]  three billion in 12 years they have six children on average five and a half survive on average europe
[26:43.680 --> 26:51.040]  has a 1.3 replacement rate do the math but they're not bringing in muslims to then turn them into
[26:51.040 --> 26:56.720]  westerners for the new population they're ending the west i have stacks of articles where the crosses
[26:56.720 --> 27:04.320]  are being taken down now let me give you the next phase for decades there have been no go zones for
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.640]  decades there's been mass rapes for decades there's been incredible sex crime and drug dealing
[27:08.640 --> 27:14.400]  it's under islam they can do anything they want as long as it's against the outsiders there is the
[27:14.400 --> 27:19.280]  house of islam there's the house of war everything outside islam is house of war you don't rob other
[27:19.280 --> 27:23.520]  muslims you don't kill other muslims though you do you don't sell their muslims into sex slavery
[27:23.520 --> 27:33.920]  you shell the animals the infidels into it now here's the big story document can please or you
[27:33.920 --> 27:39.360]  can put it up on screen behind me urgun he's the basically the dictator of turkey warns europeans

[28:00.480 --> 28:07.200]  to set europe on fire over defeat by turkey and then it goes on turkish leaders threatened to burn
[28:07.840 --> 28:13.440]  down please pull this up turkish leaders threatened to burn down europe and they don't
[28:13.440 --> 28:19.920]  accept the turkey party last year and this year urgun says you will accept that turkey that borders
[28:19.920 --> 28:27.600]  europe where we stopped the muslims when they took down contestant in opal but 1200 years ago
[28:27.600 --> 28:33.360]  we stopped them there eastern europe stopped them the blue mosque all that are former churches

[32:10.240 --> 32:16.960]  behavioral disorders a lot of the autism spectrum disorders are in the gut from the diets and
[32:16.960 --> 32:23.760]  vaccines that trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach that then create major toxicity in the gut

[32:53.760 --> 33:05.360]  with micro zx exclusively at info wars life dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:05.360 --> 33:22.400]  you're listening to the antidote for fake news it's alex jones
[33:35.360 --> 33:43.840]  so we've got 500 million muslims in africa they're invading every other part of africa
[33:43.840 --> 33:49.280]  bombing shooting kidnapping stealing putting women into sex slavery trump talked about it
[33:49.280 --> 33:54.720]  with the nigerian president yesterday their entire north has been invaded for decades
[33:55.280 --> 33:59.920]  they're losing the fight against the muslims the most populous country in africa
[33:59.920 --> 34:05.760]  and of course trump hinted yesterday that us troops are going to be going into nigeria
[34:06.880 --> 34:13.840]  to fight boka haram so under obama we've seen a giant islamic invasion we saw the west
[34:14.880 --> 34:21.280]  fund the arab spring we've seen the west call it migrants coming to europe and oh oh look at the
[34:21.280 --> 34:31.440]  migrant caravans climbing over the fences and and and the fields just full of a big snake a human
[34:31.440 --> 34:38.560]  snake of tens of thousands per day marching in almost all of the military age men promise free
[34:38.560 --> 34:44.800]  housing free welfare women and public service announcements on german children's television
[34:44.800 --> 34:52.800]  saying get an adult muslim man for yourself young girls and then rock star women on tv saying i
[34:52.800 --> 35:03.520]  wear the hijab in un ads telling german women put on the hijab adopt islam and now we've got the
[35:03.520 --> 35:11.920]  caravans coming up here and they chose a young woman with her children said we choose her to go
[35:11.920 --> 35:19.440]  over first so that anyone arrest her you're against the children and the un is running this whole
[35:19.440 --> 35:27.360]  operation as well the total weaponization and then when the illegals get here they're indoctrinated
[35:27.360 --> 35:33.200]  into the socialist utopia vision of the democratic party they are brought into the system and they're
[35:33.200 --> 35:43.360]  prepared to be good socialist voters good globalist voters and repeat what they did in venezuela
[35:43.360 --> 35:48.640]  the media uses emotion so that's the leftist attack is what the third world populations being
[35:48.640 --> 35:54.560]  inducted into socialism and communism the islamic attack it comes in it gets the free welfare
[35:54.560 --> 36:04.960]  the free everything and it gets funded by the very same globalist so urgun knows this and last
[36:04.960 --> 36:12.000]  year in this year when different european countries banned the turkey party the islamic turkey party
[36:13.040 --> 36:17.360]  the islamic turkish party within their countries
[36:17.360 --> 36:28.800]  urgun said we will burn europe to the ground that's a quote that was in between turkey moving to
[36:28.800 --> 36:34.720]  legalize marrying girls as young as nine because the prophet muhammad did it pkk terror is threatened
[36:34.720 --> 36:43.680]  to set europe on fire over defeat by turkey in africa it just goes on and on so the middle east
[36:43.680 --> 36:53.600]  politics is pouring in to europe and urgun wants to be the new caliphate running the middle east
[36:53.600 --> 37:05.600]  and because he's the gateway to europe it gives him a lot of power and so parliamentary systems
[37:05.600 --> 37:17.760]  can be decided by groups as small as five percent of the voting population if they vote monolithically
[37:19.200 --> 37:28.400]  muslims vote monolithically how their imams tell them their voting records are checked
[37:28.400 --> 37:34.640]  by the imams they live in a authoritarian cult so they're perfect for the left and you've got a
[37:34.640 --> 37:43.920]  lot of these european countries are 20 percent muslim now that's enough to throw any parliamentary
[37:43.920 --> 37:52.720]  election so labor and the greens and all of them are running after it wanting the vote and what
[37:52.720 --> 37:59.120]  does islam say led by ira ghan and by saudi arabia by turkey and saudi arabia they say we want
[37:59.120 --> 38:09.760]  completely open borders we want quotas of a million quote migrants a year to each country
[38:10.400 --> 38:22.320]  regardless of size hungary poland it goes on and on germany france and if you don't take it you get
[38:22.320 --> 38:34.800]  a huge eu fine and then macron said last week he said oh we need 200 million people from north africa
[38:34.800 --> 38:41.840]  and they're going to be coming and then isis said no no no it's up at europewars.com our new european
[38:41.840 --> 38:48.800]  bureau 500 million africans could invade europe over isis plan you an official and remember isis said
[38:48.800 --> 38:55.680]  invade europe five years ago and europe opened its doors isis is saudi arabia they're working
[38:55.680 --> 39:04.640]  with the eu that's the globalist so that's why europe is basically already done is because europe
[39:05.600 --> 39:14.480]  and its parliamentary system has let in more than 10 islamic populations in sweden germany 20
[39:14.480 --> 39:18.880]  percent in some of the other countries they now are leveraged and are taking over the political
[39:18.880 --> 39:25.120]  process and are being put in positions of power everywhere and now saying you will dress different
[39:25.120 --> 39:30.880]  we we will have segregated uh men and women on the buses women will not wear short skirts
[39:30.880 --> 39:36.400]  and the green party leaders of the green party in europe are saying yes women it's your fault
[39:36.400 --> 39:40.880]  and you wonder why they're all over to islam and why feminist events they take their shirts off and
[39:40.880 --> 39:49.600]  then scream a la oct bar and because it's it's signaling to the muslims invade we're here we're
[39:49.600 --> 39:54.160]  friends because it's a takeover of the west and the women don't care of their slaves or their
[39:54.160 --> 40:01.200]  daughters are slaves they have an existential brainwashing like a duck that has been hatched
[40:01.200 --> 40:06.640]  out of the egg that imprints on the tyranny it just wants to take down christianity
[40:06.640 --> 40:14.960]  and that's why macron has now come out and said that there that none of the migrants rape anybody
[40:14.960 --> 40:19.120]  doesn't matter all the real statistics showed nine and 95 percent are the muslims raping
[40:19.120 --> 40:28.320]  doesn't matter now let's go over some of it turkey wants europe to criminalize islamophobia
[40:30.400 --> 40:36.000]  critics know hypocrisy in how muslim nations treat christians well of course they don't
[40:36.000 --> 40:42.480]  want free speech this guy's arrested thousands thousands of journalists he threatens europe

[40:51.680 --> 40:56.960]  own church because they their weekly gathering coincided with a muslim women's event who wanted
[40:56.960 --> 41:01.280]  the building to be free of men that's right they've taken the crosses down they're saying there is
[41:01.280 --> 41:07.120]  lomic centers all over europe we christians are banned from our christian community because
[41:07.120 --> 41:15.760]  it is a muslim event and then it goes over all of it that's in germany isis warns of random killings

[42:01.120 --> 42:10.480]  banning free speech of the non muslim majority see muslim minorities will dominate you because they
[42:10.480 --> 42:22.000]  work as a unified focused laser beam they act as a cult and that's why they're so hard to deal with

[44:18.560 --> 44:24.240]  atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form we discovered that oil companies
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.880]  and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies
[44:28.880 --> 44:34.080]  and also drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market they start
[44:34.080 --> 44:40.880]  jacking up the price but we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out hopefully just like
[44:40.880 --> 44:45.440]  the last time this happened a few years ago it's not an issue and we do get more but right now we

[47:06.320 --> 47:19.840]  so
[47:23.440 --> 47:25.840]  so we have an authoritarian religion
[47:27.680 --> 47:31.920]  that creates the most mass murder of other religious groups and non-religious groups in the
[47:31.920 --> 47:39.440]  world that's constantly at war with itself that the people of the religion are trying to flee it
[47:41.040 --> 47:45.440]  so they can come to your country and make you submit to it that's what islam means
[47:49.120 --> 47:53.280]  and then you've got the socialist in parliamentary systems all over the world
[47:53.920 --> 47:58.400]  there's hardly any other countries that have our system of just two different houses
[47:58.400 --> 48:08.320]  two different parties and our unique system of legislative executive and judicial
[48:10.080 --> 48:13.120]  and the left's always wanting to get rid of it having a parliamentary system
[48:13.120 --> 48:17.600]  they're always wanting new parties you're supposed to have a new movement take over one of the parties
[48:18.960 --> 48:24.240]  that's what to say europe needs two party systems because you can get a minority group
[48:24.240 --> 48:29.120]  group that takes control in a parliamentary system and oppresses the majority
[48:32.800 --> 48:38.320]  hitler was able to get elected in a parliamentary system with only what 30 something percent of the
[48:38.320 --> 48:44.400]  vote but that was still a majority because there were a bunch of other parties
[48:47.280 --> 48:50.800]  well now the muslims can ally with the greens and the communists
[48:50.800 --> 48:58.480]  and they can get whoever they want elected and that's only with 10 15 20 percent of the population
[48:59.120 --> 49:05.360]  and it's going to be 30 40 they're saying by 2050 almost every european country will be majority
[49:05.360 --> 49:10.080]  muslim and boy that's going to be interesting to watch because everywhere that happens they
[49:10.080 --> 49:15.280]  start killing everybody and they start putting you to the sword and they start taking your women
[49:15.280 --> 49:20.400]  and then they start killing each other because the muslims always fight and if they're spoils oh
[49:20.400 --> 49:26.960]  my god beautiful europe all the industry all the weapons uh all the technology
[49:29.120 --> 49:32.560]  and you're not going to have jihadis that are super inbred with low iqs they're going
[49:32.560 --> 49:39.120]  to inbred with the europeans and katie bar the door i think the planet will get blown up at that point
[49:42.800 --> 49:48.320]  so it's the end of the planet islam's going to kill the planet and the left wanting short term
[49:48.320 --> 49:54.080]  gains to overthrow the west to overthrow free market to win and get control of it is allied
[49:54.080 --> 50:00.400]  with islam and they think they can control it at 15 20 right now there's french cities and stuff
[50:00.400 --> 50:06.640]  burning every week there's no go zones all over europe you can't it's a nightmare it looks like it's
[50:06.640 --> 50:21.840]  llamabad there's feces everywhere people walking around mumbling with 70 iqs it's just total suicide
[50:21.840 --> 50:27.520]  but it's the globalist plan and turkey wanting it to be criminalized to talk about this because
[50:27.520 --> 50:31.680]  they think they've got us europe's got to go back to two party systems they've got to deport
[50:31.680 --> 50:36.960]  all these people they say the average invader every night for five years 80 plus percent or so on
[50:36.960 --> 50:46.480]  welfare to deport them or at suicide you're importing murder and dysfunction and insanity
[50:47.600 --> 50:53.760]  and isis brags about it and then micron gets up at a speech yesterday and he says
[50:54.560 --> 51:00.080]  terror in europe and violence and rape is europe's fault not linked to mass immigration
[51:00.080 --> 51:04.000]  he's also saying the french flag is not red white and blue
[51:06.320 --> 51:12.240]  or that he married his middle school teacher he did that's gaslighting
[51:15.680 --> 51:16.880]  here let's play it here it is
[51:16.880 --> 51:28.800]  i mean mass migration i'm to be fair i'm not absolutely sure to share your assessment
[51:30.480 --> 51:38.640]  i would explain why i'm absolutely not naive in our societies we have a need for more security
[51:39.440 --> 51:45.440]  more national security especially for women and that's why we are passing in France as well
[51:45.440 --> 51:50.960]  a very strong law against violence against women and against sexual sexual harassment because it's
[51:50.960 --> 51:57.120]  part of this insecure lack of security for women you mentioned and i already addressed anti-semitism
[51:57.120 --> 52:06.320]  referring to the question of your colleague i i don't believe this phenomena are directly linked
[52:07.120 --> 52:10.560]  to this migration this current migration coming from africa why
[52:10.560 --> 52:17.200]  why we're publicly correct we're committing suicide only 95 percent the police say
[52:17.840 --> 52:21.280]  is the muslims raping but why because it's not brand new
[52:22.000 --> 52:28.960]  unapply we we've had this issue for years not to say decades in my country i mean you were
[52:28.960 --> 52:35.360]  referring to jack shirk i i i do remember i'll stop right there so yeah pepula pew might hit on you
[52:35.360 --> 52:44.000]  but he's equating asking a woman out or whatever with islamics burning down cities raping women
[52:44.000 --> 52:49.760]  putting them in the sex slavery all the grooming of little girls that's all over europe and he's
[52:49.760 --> 52:55.680]  like it's not immigration that's doing it yay we're all in a cult he just said two plus two equals seven
[52:57.600 --> 53:03.200]  because they've committed as the ruling globalist to do this for total power and to vote out
[53:03.200 --> 53:08.800]  nationalists and conservatives that's the unpopular unelected authoritarian e use plan
[53:08.800 --> 53:15.440]  is to bring in enough muslims to vote everybody's rights away it's authoritarian this is world war
[53:15.440 --> 53:23.920]  three this is the new world war demographic leftist globalist directed and then if you want to get up
[53:24.560 --> 53:29.520]  and try to criticize it urgun wants it outlawed and don't worry in england if you're a nationalist
[53:29.520 --> 53:35.040]  or a patriot sidik khan the islamic mayor now has all his other islamics getting in power now what
[53:35.040 --> 53:41.360]  one of them's the head of their border patrol an islamicist man thrown out of london assembly

[54:35.680 --> 54:41.360]  we're facing today in the whole world yeah ahok a governor with a minority anisity was throwing the
[54:41.360 --> 54:49.040]  jail for insulting quran yeah in a muslim country and that's you did not speak up about that and
[54:49.040 --> 54:53.920]  then you instead you made a statement about um terrorism attack is part and parcel of living
[54:53.920 --> 54:59.120]  in a big city i'm sorry that's a big problem no i'm sorry this is the root cause of the crime

[55:56.240 --> 56:00.080]  speech event is what it's called lee first mentioned the incident where jacarta governor
[56:01.280 --> 56:05.920]  was sentenced to two years in jail for insulting the korean and indonesia and rather
[56:05.920 --> 56:11.120]  and address the affront of free speech mayor con was busy explaining how islamic terrorism was part
[56:11.120 --> 56:17.520]  and parcel of living in a big city it's relevant to terror attacks and crime rate so that the
[56:17.520 --> 56:24.000]  root caused the problem we're facing today in the world lee said no i'm sorry we want questions
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.280]  related to the safety of london that will do barked deputy chairman of the london assembly

[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:52.720]  researcher journalist secret society member you name it and leo zegami has predicted so
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:58.720]  much of what we've seen with the rise of populism that he said would be led by burlesconi as an
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.080]  example six seven years ago you now see that i want to quickly cover the waterfront with him
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.920]  in the next segment that's longer about who is this pope why does he live behind 180 foot walls
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.400]  that says europe shouldn't have any why does he say he doesn't like europe's christian roots why
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.200]  is he allied with radical islam why is he saying the whole world should turn their weapons in but
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:27.760]  of course the un and the globalist uh where's the deputy pope or the his buddy that got indicted for
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.200]  kidnapping over 100 children we never hear about that anymore show we're joined by leo zegami
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.400]  to update us on this and also the knights of malta vie for grandmaster vote what does that mean
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.960]  cardinal george pal to face trial on historical abuse charges we'll cover the waterfront uh
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.560]  leo zegami i've mentioned a lot of things we'll cover in the next segment this one's short
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:54.640]  but what else do you want to get into today my friend well you outlined the basis of what
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.920]  we will be talking about a lot of all your listeners to yourself and when we talk about
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:07.600]  pope france is preaching now be a twitter that everybody should design itself and get rid of
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:14.720]  weapons we have to understand that pope frances has the best bodyguards on the planet trained
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:22.320]  since the four uh this since uh basically 600 years ago there are 125 swiss guards they use the
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:30.880]  most little weapons they train with mosad up in in the golem mountains in israel and and so to
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:38.560]  actually state that he wants to get rid of his weapons is the biggest joke ever really alex it's
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:45.920]  hilarious so i'm pretty shocked that we are even discussing this today and regarding cardinal pal
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:54.160]  he's just came out of the court a few a few hours ago and in front of everybody that was actually
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:03:00.960]  uh finally uploading for the decision of this court because cardinal pal will be trialed and
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.960]  the the catholics in australia of course are outraged the catholic publications and all the
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:14.160]  rest but cardinal pal will be trial trial because he will face his trial because there is a lot of
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:22.480]  evidence involving him with pedophile activities that go back uh does for many years but they are
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:29.040]  there i mean you can he has to face his his own and again there's been so little coverage of this
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:34.000]  this guy was number three to the pope running an industrial pedophile operations reportedly to
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.440]  compromise folks and so this is we now know one of the guys reportedly helping the jesuets prepare
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:47.680]  the total takedown of the vatican and the takeover using pedophilia yes i mean cardinal pal now is
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:55.920]  facing also of course a lot of criticism within the vatican conservative side that tomorrow has a
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:02.240]  very important event that you have just mentioned when you were representing me earlier on and that
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:08.400]  is the election of the grandmaster of the knights of malta that will take place on the second tomorrow
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:16.640]  the second of may 2018 in a period of uncertainty for the knights of malta that are seen by pope
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:22.640]  frances as a threat because within the knights of malta there is certain conservative forces
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:29.360]  that have been laying down for centuries there and don't want to give up on real catholicism which
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.800]  of course pope frances is completely destroying so there is this big confrontation between three
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:40.640]  candidates they are of course three aristocrats we can talk about after the let's come back and get
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:47.760]  into cardinal pal the pedophile ringleader that compromised the last situation and brought in the
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:54.800]  new false pope and this new battle inside the knights of malta and more with leo zigami stay with us
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.400]  i want to plow into all of this that i'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging

[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:27.280]  from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas transmitting worldwide
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:34.160]  it's alex jones tomorrow's news today we broke down even before the london guardian did with
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:41.600]  leo zigami but four or five years ago that you would have this new pope the head of the jesuits
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:49.760]  and that now pope frances as he's known would try to finally destroy any christianity any
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:55.840]  conservatism in the catholic church and he's now declared war on borders declared war saying
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:01.200]  he's disgusted by people talking about europe's christian roots he's calling for major governments
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:07.360]  to be disarmed but of course the un will be armed right out of hunger games and his right hand man
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:15.200]  the number three person at the vatican cardinal george pell to face trial on historic abuse
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:22.320]  charges reportedly trafficking in hundreds of young boys for decades in a program to compromise
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:29.440]  the catholic church with sex operatives so that is a breaking uh ladies ladies and gentlemen on
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:39.840]  mayday which is also a big globalist occultic holiday so there you go and you heard leo zigami
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:46.160]  report on this gosh it was years and years ago he of course wrote the book the last pope
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:51.600]  i've traveled to rome and he's taking us around to a lot of places the general public can't even
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:57.200]  get into uh because he comes from an aristocratic family with all the connections and it is pretty
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:04.080]  amazing so recapping because some stations just joined us how big this is with pel we know that
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:11.040]  frances used this to blackmail the last group to get control even the garden the london guardian
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:16.960]  confirmed that so what's the next shoe to drop what does this signify with the civil war going on
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:25.200]  inside the catholic church and how could how could frances be this arrogant to openly say you know
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:30.560]  there's no hell and all the religions are the same and we need a one world religion uh and we
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.840]  need to get rid of european sovereignty and we need to submit to islam and he won't even criticize
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:42.320]  islamicists or stand up for the victims i mean just recap who this guy is how he came to power
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:49.360]  how you were able to predict it by name five years before he got in well pope frances papa
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:56.800]  bergoio was known within certain circles since 2005 when he made the first attempt thanks to cardinal
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:02.880]  martini who was a jesuit late cardinal martini who is now deceased who was his mentor and thanks to
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.880]  him and the mafia of saint gallen in switzerland where they used to meet this group of powerful
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:15.440]  jesuits put together the plan to get ratzinger out of the picture which they did eventually and
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:23.440]  the place for the first time in history jesuit pope of course now the biggest enemy to the jesuits
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:30.080]  in this moment is the knights of malta because traditionally it was this war between the knights
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:37.120]  of malta and the jesuits that kicked out eventually the knights of malta out of malta because napoleon
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:44.320]  on behalf of the jesuits then kicked kicked out these knights out of their historic island and
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:50.800]  so since then there is a big friction between the knights of malta and the jesuits but since last
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:58.400]  year he has put on the side cardinal berg which is of course very close to ramond berg very close
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:05.280]  to donald trump and that is an enemy he's considered an enemy by pope frances so he was set aside
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:11.200]  the knights of malta have been put in the hands of jacko modellatore del tampe di san minito who is
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:17.440]  a member of the black aristocracy and now tomorrow together with another candidate called ludwig
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:24.160]  osman who is i think austrian and a very powerful commander of the knights of malta and another guy
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.960]  called carlo depolito di san tipolito these three are the candidates to take over the knights of
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:35.520]  malta this is a big thing alex especially now because the pope wants to destroy the knights of
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:45.440]  malta eliminate the sovereignty status and basically make them an order like all the others that he
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.600]  has under his control with no independence and this is a big thing that is happening on the on
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.040]  the second of may 2018 probably the biggest thing at the moment in the Vatican the international
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.080]  media of course doesn't know how to cover it because they are as you know very ignorant of these
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:08.880]  topics that me and you have been discussing for many years but of course if the conservative forces
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:15.360]  lose tomorrow the knights of malta will be taken over by the Jesuits and they will be destroyed
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:25.200]  wow so the consolidation over the church by the society of jesus it will be almost complete if
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.640]  this happens or totally complete at that point it will be totally complete because they will have
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:40.240]  the finances the military side all sides in that in the power why can't you see people like the bushes
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.840]  people like the clean tones all these people depend on the knights of malta the knights of
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:53.280]  malta control the parts of the central intelligence agency imagine how powerful is this war that is
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.840]  being fought now in the Vatican tomorrow that's right uh in fact there's a lot of high-level
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.560]  cia folks they call the cia catholics in action but that's been more the conservative knights of
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:07.760]  malta type so there is some truth to Vatican power in our government obviously uh and then of course
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:13.120]  georgetown and you've got uh all the rest of it i have georgetown suing me for the first time ever
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:18.960]  a university directly georgetown is completing the hands of the enemy is the jesuit headquarters
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.120]  where they bred the clean tones where they uh brought up all those liberals in the central
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:30.400]  intelligence agency that that is the place you know so you have the enemy attacking you directly
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:36.080]  with george soros being able to find some of these lawsuits against you it's very hard to fight back
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.200]  but we have to try and i pray for doing what you're doing well yeah i mean if people want to know
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.160]  i'm bonafide we're leading this major populist movement worldwide we're under massive attack
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.320]  and there's not a lot of mavericks out there's matt drudz there's myself there's people like you leo
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:56.640]  and i mean i have the georgetown university suing me and they say our goal is to shut him down
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.240]  we will destroy him i mean they say this publicly so why do you think that i guess the jesuits are
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:08.960]  really i mean this is i guess the pedophile pope pope francis wants to be silenced pope francis
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:17.040]  is really uh working against of course the only media that are talking against him and that are
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:23.440]  telling the truth and so we are here on info wars amongst the few people who do this and so we will
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:30.000]  be under attack by these powerful people and because they have unlimited resources alex
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:37.760]  i really ask our viewers to support info wars because this is the only way we have to support
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:44.880]  ourselves in this battle for the truth it's so incredible to see the real power and so again
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.720]  you've got georgetown that's jesuit it's about to take over the nights of malta that is one of the
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:57.680]  main powers in the cia but it's been a balanced power against that uh there's got to be a way to
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:03.840]  stop francis when he got in using his his his pedophile operations now his right-hand man's
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:09.280]  been caught as a giant pedophile operator uh and and and now them finally moving ahead with the
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.160]  indictment now they're going to try him this is announced on mayday what type of weird message
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:22.880]  is that having the pedophile uh number two to the pope uh being uh certified that it is going to court
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:31.040]  well he has a lot of internal enemies in the Vatican that don't want to uh him to come back
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:38.560]  to Rome of course you know the Vatican is full of snakes full of people that are ready to backstab
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:45.120]  you to get back uh and get themselves that power so they don't want him back in Rome really but
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:51.840]  at the same time is a very powerful element of the catholic church and if this trial goes
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:58.160]  moves forward and they actually condemn him then the Vatican will find itself in real difficulty
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:06.320]  in in in australia and and not only in australia but worldwide because this guy before he goes down
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:11.600]  is definitely gonna then bring down a lot of other people with him cardinal is not alone
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:17.280]  as you know the international pedophile ring is extensive and goes well beyond the catholic
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:24.640]  church as we have seen from the government say from the parliament in england to hollywood to
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:31.360]  anywhere and everywhere this is an international network of powerful people that have this passion
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:37.280]  for for things that are forbidden and so they think that they can get away with it because
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:42.240]  they think they are gods that is what and in this day absolutely folks you're getting real
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:46.320]  veritas with leo zagami if i'm not about his award-winning books at leozagami.com and that's

[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:26.080]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:34.160]  folks i try to not build myself up i don't think of myself as some big hot shot i've studied history
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:40.880]  i'm a nationalist i'm a capitalist i'm a christian and i've studied things and i've been massively
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:45.760]  criticized over the years for not saying that the vatican ran the world i knew the vatican had
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:51.200]  conservative factions liberal factions has done some good things against abortion you know communism
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:57.520]  had also done bad things but the jesuits and hilary's saying that she's a geowittical thinker
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:04.560]  and that she based she's been asked what is your philosophy and she says geowittical that doesn't
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:10.240]  mean jews that means the society of jesus that has nothing to do with that at least in the last
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:16.640]  couple hundred years and it's been wanting power over the vatican all along as the protector it
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:23.840]  you know set up in portugal in spain and so now you see it in full control it's consolidating powers
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:30.160]  let's say what you want about the vatican before it is now 180 degrees the opposite of the bible
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:36.080]  and every catholic i talk to sees it people still go there a traditionalist but i just see the
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:41.520]  churches as kind of the fronts like universities really are hedge funds now and they got a football
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:49.680]  team it's the same thing and now i have the main vatican university shooing me lawyers say they've
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:56.880]  never seen anything like it shang we want to destroy alex jones now why do the globalist hate
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:02.400]  trump why do the globalist hate nigel forage why do they hate the russians what's really going on
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.240]  so leo you're gonna be on with us a full hour next wednesday to really cover the waterfront here but
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:13.360]  but how can't we get rid of this this false pope he's so diametrically opposed to everything that's
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:19.200]  common sense of christian you know he says that famously that however it is possible to interpret
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:25.520]  the objective of ices in matthew's gospel where jesus sends his disciples all nations in terms of
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:31.840]  the same idea of conquest that's what he said of ices two years ago so you've got he's got europe
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:36.400]  calling for open borders it's got macron saying the muslims commit no crime they're putting his
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:43.120]  llamasist in charge is your answer this that if we are successful at getting rid of frances
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:48.160]  he'll just step down as you predicted and they'll have new popes that are at what for your terms
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.800]  because i know that fits in so that his personalities go once they've worn out their usefulness
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.680]  he steps back so speak to that what their in game is how we can stop these people and who
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:02.480]  they really are and and and what will they do they get control full control of the club
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:10.480]  well i mean in this moment of time a rat singer who as you know is behind the scenes and not playing
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:17.040]  any more an active role is actually active in the sense that until he's alive there is a certain
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:24.880]  faction in the Vatican that feels protected in a more conservative faction and and of course
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:30.160]  once he's dead the pop frances were resigned immediately and they will be like you said
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:37.040]  the one pop after the other it will become just like a normal secular office regarding instead
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.120]  the role of freemasonry especially liberal freemasonry especially french freemasonry and
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:51.040]  macron has a special connection to the pope because the president of france by tradition
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:57.520]  has a specific role that is given in the cathedral of saint latin in rome which is the home of the
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:03.040]  Vatican and so there is a document which i have inserted in this publication which is volume five
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:10.720]  of my confession the document regarding french freemasonry and immigration in this communication
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:16.160]  by all the various grand orient of france grand loge de france and all the various liberal
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:23.760]  masonic obedience is in france they invite people and you can see this yourself to accept immigrants
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:31.280]  this is not a conspiracy this is reality this is a document and and it's a document that is
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:37.600]  signed by these people and it's of course a communication made to the french press so i mean
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:42.800]  we are not talking about a conspiracy this is the reality of liberal freemasonry which is
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:50.880]  at least which has broken from regularity in the 1870s and this liberal freemasonry became
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:56.960]  the home of communism of people like lenin trusty and who gave them birth to the grand
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:03.040]  orient of the russian people and at that point communism so we are in front of the enemy alex
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:10.160]  and the enemy is always coming and if you go back to the jesuit priest who wasn't really a jesuit he
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:16.800]  was a satanist adam weishoff at engelsdott university who created the false modern illuminati
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:21.920]  you actually want to bring darkness he said we'll act like we're liberals and egalitarians and
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:27.040]  reformers we'll get all the best minds on our side but our secret goal this has all been released
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:33.440]  declassified is total power over the family over reality we'll have nine day work weeks no holidays
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:39.520]  we will rape and murder and kill and drink blood and and no we will be the new royalty we will be
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:46.640]  luciferian gods and so what do they plan to do with islam are they gonna just let it burn
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.080]  everything to ground and then exterminate them because i don't see how they think they're gonna
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.040]  beat islam how will the devil worshipers beat islam i mean i know it's basically another branch of that
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:03.360]  they don't beat islam they made an alliance with islam the first of may 1776 which today
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:09.040]  we are also celebrating in some way with what we bought here in italy we are celebrating basically
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:16.400]  a festivity which is communist in nature so it shows you that the first of may may day is which
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.760]  is the foundation of the illuminati is the roots also of modern communism if you're going to study
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:28.800]  modern commune communism and how it's born first with the jesuits then with the illuminati then
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:35.200]  with certain jewish factions there is a thread here that ends up with pop francis and pop francis
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:42.160]  is the guy who is embracing islam because islam is basically the religion they're using to destroy
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:49.040]  christianity once they have destroyed the christianity of course they will destroy islam islam
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:55.360]  would be destroyed very easily because people who are now the chiefs of islam are already
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:00.240]  corrupt and are some of the most corrupt people in the union some of the most hypocrites the people
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:08.480]  like the princes of saudi arabia who go and behave like spoiled brats totally moral totally
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:14.160]  totally moral and then go back to their country and they preach and they enslave women and they
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:21.520]  treat people like criminals all this because is hypocrisy alex is hypocrisy and there is this
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:28.640]  alliance that between the liberals the communists and islam which sets the purpose the purpose is
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:33.680]  to destroy christianity we've got mike adams coming in but i want to do five more minutes with you
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:37.840]  and we come back let's start getting into it now for people that understand the parliamentary system
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.240]  that are in the us where you can have 10 15 parties and even a party with 10 percent and change
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:48.240]  elections when you get european countries up to 20 percent the muslims vote in blocks it said they
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.080]  can't be stopped once they reach that level unless you get rid of the parliamentary system
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:56.880]  and that's why the left is allied with them and that in many areas it's almost undefeatable already
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:04.560]  alex today if you go and see on google they were marching in the streets of italy with communist
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:12.160]  flags only black immigrants all arab black immigrants were marching mostly black that
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:18.720]  were just off the boats were given the flags the communist flags and the flags of the various
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:25.280]  basically all these communists left wing organizations that are manipulated by george
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:32.240]  soros and you see this thing and it's quite shocking because up until a few years ago nobody
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.880]  will have imagined this kind of situation during ships and a million people out of north america
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.440]  now they're marching with communist flags let's talk about how we stop it on the other side leo
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:47.440]  zegami on target we're talking about islam being the sword of the luciferians to kill the west to
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.880]  kill christianity to kill the real renaissance to kill the real illumination they are the false

[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:10.800]  history of survival shield x2 our flagship product we are having supply chain problems and this may
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:16.560]  be the last batch of this we have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:22.800]  into purple gas in the atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form we discovered
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:27.760]  that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:32.400]  companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:39.040]  they start jacking up the price but we're offering it still 25 off until it sells out
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.720]  hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago it's not an issue and we do get
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:48.560]  more but right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine

[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:47.040]  uranium and how that ties into all this but just very calmly here leo zegami get excited
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:53.440]  i'm being calm you talk about the jesuit order suing me out of georgetown i've talked to all
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.160]  the top lawyers they've never seen a university do this they say the professors we're going to
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:05.520]  destroy alex jones um we're going to shut him up and then they lie about what i've said what i've
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:14.000]  done and that they're doing it to trump it was in the observer that's owned by his his family
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.200]  member jared kushner saying that trump is a russian agent needs to be destroyed and the same
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:24.880]  articles says i need to be destroyed let me just ask you this why do they want to in your expert
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:29.680]  view because any of the listeners understand this is in height they're they say when they get us
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:33.600]  even the wall street journal two months ago said we're going to get jones first then wiki leaks and
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.920]  everybody else will fall i hope the audience and everybody else is understanding matt drudge came
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:41.840]  and warned us exclusively two years ago this was coming that would be us and then everybody else next
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:47.920]  he was told by supreme court justice a good guy uh the other uh conservative that didn't die mysteriously
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:55.200]  that same year so here we are a why do they hate us to understand what they fear and then be
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:01.200]  who are the good guys because i'm not an idiot i don't think the russians are perfect i don't think
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:06.640]  you know uh the u kipps perfect or i'm perfect but what is it that that the jackabins we know
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:12.480]  that's the ancient communist system that basically an adam visop came out of i don't believe in the
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:18.000]  illuminati we just mean christ illuminates freedom renaissance that illuminates they call themselves
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.400]  the illuminati when they're the false illuminati i'm not saying there's a secret real illuminati
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:27.040]  but i mean clear there were a lot of old ancient groups that did want human freedom those movements
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:32.400]  have been infiltrated by the illuminati visop bragged about how we'll take over the secret
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:37.040]  organizations that are promoting freedom they captured those now they're about to fully capture
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:42.400]  the knights of malta that does pretty much run the cia according to my high-level cia sources
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.480]  uh and then what will this signify
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:55.840]  they they want people to conform to their ideology so the media have a role of being
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:02.080]  add domesticated the idiots puppets in their control the alternative media is the number
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:08.640]  one enemy at the moment so what you said falls into this picture they want to eliminate the
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:13.680]  alternative media and have only their voice controlling everything i mean communism is about
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:20.320]  propaganda alex and they have to control this propaganda in italy for example we have even a
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:27.760]  tv show run by the communist one of the main channels called propaganda lie and this to this
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.960]  extent we are in the hands of communists here in europe you are not to such an instance in the
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:41.040]  guns of communists in the u.s because of course with the patriots like the the big society people
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:47.040]  who have defended the role of the family of certain conservative values and now with donald j
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:52.880]  trump in the presidency of course they feel threatened and they are attacking you who are
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:59.360]  one of the spokesperson for this revolution that has installed donald j trump in the white house
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:03.840]  so i mean of course you are the number one enemy i mean georges town is the place where
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:09.600]  clinton beer clinton came out of i mean beer clinton so i mean you are talking of course about
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:14.640]  one of your number one enemies because here in clinton i'm sure it's not your friend alex he has
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:21.840]  he has even mentioned you several times no so i mean these people now have the possibility
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:28.880]  to shut us down because of course the majority of the media are still in their hands but if
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:35.440]  trump continues with his success with what he has done in uh in north korea with what he has
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:44.320]  done around the world with taking the right steps and not really following macron is mad
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:53.120]  war man in the middle east i think that it's a very important that we take seriously this noble
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:59.200]  peace price for donald j trump which i proposed immediately even before i heard about the south
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:06.160]  korean president saying that because i think it's the best possibility also for norway the kingdom
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:13.840]  of norway to finally do a just thing because with the obama they ruined the reputation and unfortunately
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:19.440]  because the kingdom of norway has accepts accepted through the course of time and i have evidence
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:27.120]  for this money from the clinton foundation they are unfortunately in the hands of the liberals
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:33.840]  and we have to free scandinavia from the liberals because as you see every day from sweden what's
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:41.040]  happening in sweden chaos every day so we need to re establish certain values also here in europe
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:48.560]  but you are doing it there from from america from texas and you are of course a threat to the new
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:55.360]  world order and they want to shut you down and georgetown university is definitely a very powerful
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:02.480]  enemy because these people not only have the money but these people are the ones who have the lawyers
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:08.400]  have the majesties have the course in their control it's very difficult when you have an enemy like
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:13.920]  this so you're doing the right thing to expose it publicly because once you expose it publicly
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:19.840]  the enemy will have to make some steps back and and leo it's critical for the audience to do that
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.160]  as well and to make a big deal out of this because they've bragged once they get us they believe it's
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.280]  the first major domino when you join us for a full hour next week we'll take calls we'll talk about
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:33.440]  how do we bring down the corrupt group that's hijacked the Vatican because you know it wasn't
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:37.760]  perfect but now it's gone full evil and most catholics i've talked to in fact all catholics
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.800]  i've talked to even liberal ones are just like this is crazy how do we stop this and what happens if
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:49.280]  we don't uh with leo zigami next week we'll talk to you next week for a full hour thank you thank you
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.760]  Alex all right Mike Adams is here with me we're going to break in a minute we're going to come back

[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:08.600]  So he's a jack of many scientific trades, and he's got a ton of news articles and analysis
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:11.600]  He's gonna break down right now, so Mike, thanks for coming
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:14.600]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:18.600]  Prime Minister Netanyahu really broke huge news yesterday, as you know
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:22.600]  That cache of documents, 100,000 plus documents
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:27.600]  There's some CD-ROMs that showed that Iran has a secret nuclear weapons program
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:35.600]  That they've been pursuing even after 2015 when Obama signed the deal with Iran
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.600]  To try to denuclearize their country, but what we are going to do today is connect the dots
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.600]  This is major breaking news research
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:50.600]  What I have here in the next few minutes, as Alex has invited me on to share this special report
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:56.600]  He is connecting the dots of events that happened from 2011, 2015, 2016 and today
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:02.600]  That show that former President Obama transferred military technology to Iran
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:09.600]  Transferred illegally laundered money to Iran to fund its covert nuclear program
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:17.600]  Laundered uranium nuclear fuel into Iran in order to provide them the fuel that they need to build nuclear weapons
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:22.600]  And then lied to America, told America that none of this was happening
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:28.600]  And won a Nobel Peace Prize for lying to America while arming America's enemies
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:31.600]  So I'm gonna break that down for you here over the next few minutes
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:36.600]  And Alex, I was going to do this as a counter-think episode, but I realized this was too important
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:37.600]  This needs to go out right now
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.600]  Well, you're still gonna do that if this is a good launch of counter-think
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:45.600]  You're gonna tape a show each week that's gonna air after the popular Sunday broadcast
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.600]  We want our affiliates to all be sure TV and radio to pick that up
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:52.600]  Because Mike, I gotta say, in many ways, is a lot better than I am on radio and TV
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:55.600]  And he also does, I don't know how he does it, so much preparation for everything
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:03.600]  If you're watching on TV right now, you're getting to see the amazing graphics he's put together for the first episode
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.600]  That I guess is gonna air this Sunday of counter-think
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.600]  You're gonna get a sneak peek of that right now
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.600]  But I really respect Mike
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:12.600]  Mike's not a pro-war guy, he was against the Iraq War, you name it
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:16.600]  But he's in here saying this whole thing with Obama, and I believe him, I've seen the evidence
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:19.600]  Is a bad deal, and this is why Trump is so upset
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:25.600]  We don't want war, but I think really bringing all this out is important to let Iran know that we're aware of what they did
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:29.600]  But even more importantly, this could bring down Obama and the Clinton crime syndicate
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.600]  So break all down the facts and what's behind this
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:38.600]  Alright, it does involve Hillary Clinton, Robert Mueller, Barack Obama, and other players in the current crime syndicate
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:40.600]  So let's start at the beginning
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:46.600]  Number one, December 2011, and I apologize in advance, I'm gonna have to refer to a lot of my notes here
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:48.600]  But for those of you listening on radio, that doesn't matter
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.600]  No, it's fine, you're going through the evidence here
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:58.600]  That's right, December 2011, we were told by the mainstream media that a drone was GPS spoofed by Iran
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:04.600]  And that they captured the drone by landing it without crashing it on a runway in Iran
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:11.600]  And that gave them all of this military technology in our drone, it was an RQ-170 Sentinel drone
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:19.600]  I believe today, based on the evidence that I'm presenting here, that that drone was deliberately delivered to Iran by Barack Obama
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.600]  It was not captured
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:26.600]  We know that GPS spoofing is possible when you're using a civilian GPS signal
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:31.600]  However, military drones use encrypted military GPS signals
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:34.600]  Beating the encryption is virtually impossible
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:37.600]  Even if you have quantum computers, which Iran does not have
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:42.600]  It scrambled, and a lot of it's classified, but it's designed as soon as it picks something up, it's not scrambled
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.600]  You can't break it, it jumps to another scrambled frequency
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:49.600]  Yes, and I think it's 512-bit or 1024-bit military-grade encryption
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:51.600]  It is almost impossible to break
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:59.600]  But the other experts that have talked about this said that it would be virtually impossible for Iran to even visually spot this aircraft
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.600]  It has a very low profile
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:05.600]  In order to jam its GPS and conduct its GPS spoofing and capture it
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:10.600]  You would have to spot the aircraft and then broadcast GPS signals
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:17.600]  Beating the military encryption and overtaking the communication between this aircraft, the drone, and satellites
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:21.600]  Now these drones can fly up to 40,000 feet, probably higher, that's classified
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:27.600]  But how do you interfere with satellite signals between the drone and high orbit satellites
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:29.600]  If you have land-based broadband
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:31.600]  You'd have to have another satellite
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:34.600]  Or a balloon that was higher
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:38.600]  And the point is that this was not hacked
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:41.600]  This is what is now coming together, we're connecting the dots
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:46.600]  The Christian Science Monitor reported, quote, deep skepticism from some US cyber warfare experts
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:50.600]  Who doubt Iran's ability to carry out such an operation
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:55.600]  Even Russia has not hijacked US military drones over Syria
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:59.600]  Think about that, if Russia hasn't done this, how could Iran have the technology?
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:02.600]  So the question is, why did Obama transfer this?
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:04.600]  He's been caught doing this lots of other times
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.600]  Why did he give him $150 billion?
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:08.600]  Exactly, we're going to connect the dots here
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:13.600]  John Bumgarner, Chief Technology Officer for the US Cyber Consequences Unit
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:20.600]  A non-profit cyber warfare think tank says that the idea of capturing this drone is almost like science fiction
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:26.600]  And remember that during all this time, by the way, Israel had been assassinating Iranian nuclear scientists
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.600]  To try to slow down their nuclear programs
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:31.600]  So Obama, who of course is an enemy of Israel
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:34.600]  And actually sought to interfere with the election of Netanyahu
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:39.600]  We'll get to that, has been transferring military technology to Iran
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:41.600]  Now, that's point one
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:43.600]  Second point, January 2016
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.600]  The US Navy ship, the Riverine Squadron 1
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:53.600]  It's based out of San Diego, 10 US Navy sailors, 9 men and 1 woman were taken hostage by Iran
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:58.600]  And they said that these two Navy ships ran aground because they went off course
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:00.600]  Or had mechanical problems
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.600]  This is nonsense, the routes are carefully planned by the Navy
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:08.600]  Other Navy ships are monitoring these Riverine boats
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:10.600]  They have advanced navigation gear
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:19.600]  What we believe now, or at least my analysis, shows that this is part of a pattern of Obama transferring military technology to Iran
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:26.600]  The GPS equipment was seized off of these boats before Iran turned those boats back over to the United States
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:30.600]  And this was a political coup, a propaganda win for Iran
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:37.600]  And John Kerry apologized for the United States and Obama basically bowed down to Iran
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:44.600]  And the media told us that this was a credible, that Iran had spoofed the GPS of these boats
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:48.600]  And they said that's possible because remember back in 2011 they spoofed the drone
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:50.600]  Which is also nonsense
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:55.600]  So they used fake news from 2011 to support the fake news in 2016
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:00.600]  All this time Obama is transferring military technology to Iran
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:03.600]  We were told that the boats misnavigated
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.600]  But that's nonsense
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:08.600]  Michael Savage pointed this out in his book Scorched Earth
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:10.600]  He said the whole thing was a setup
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:14.600]  He said there's a double agent inside of this, I'm quoting directly from Michael Savage in his book
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:19.600]  He said that agent did it to us with one of our most advanced drones two years ago
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:21.600]  You may have forgotten that already
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:23.600]  But stay there
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:25.600]  And folks you've got to stay with us
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:28.600]  Even if you're driving a truck right now or at school or at lunch
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:35.600]  You've got to come back later when we archive this to infowars.com, newswars.com, naturalnews.com and counterthink
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.600]  On Sunday when he really lays it out
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:41.600]  Because when you see all the evidence you get a clear picture of the Muslim Brotherhood
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:46.600]  Kenya, the overthrow, the Arab Spring, the collapse of Europe, the master plan
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:51.600]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement

[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:50.600]  They use their media to assassinate real news
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:54.600]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:59:01.600]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again
[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:05.600]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:08.600]  All to make them march, make them protest
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:13.600]  Make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:17.600]  To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:26.600]  Bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:30.600]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:41.600]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:47.600]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm Freedom's Safest Place
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:15.600]  Who thinks I do no wrong?
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:23.600]  But sometimes love, she just ain't always around
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:29.600]  And you know that's when I fall
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:34.600]  And I can't help myself at all
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:41.600]  And I get whiskey bent and hellbound
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:45.600]  Mike Adams is here with us, the health ranger, some stations don't care this first five minutes
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:49.600]  A lot of TV stations do a lot of radio, but some don't, I'd say half of them
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:55.600]  And so this is so important, we're gonna cover some other news right now and then get back into his big presentation
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:00.600]  And you know when he's sitting there talking about this, Mike Adams, I know this stuff, I know it's true
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:06.600]  And I'm getting frustrated, I don't get jealous of how smart he is, I get frustrated that I know all this
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:11.600]  And then I get caught up in the rat race and then I don't put the dots together and I don't break it down
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:17.600]  Why Trump's pissed about Iran, why the deal we did was bad, and what Obama had is a larger picture
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:23.600]  It's bigger than Iran, it's bigger than nuclear weapons, it's the rest of the story
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:28.600]  And we're gonna lay it out, I think it'll probably take another two or three segments and we'll get into other news here with Mike Adams
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:33.600]  But it's so critical that people understand this information
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:39.600]  We're gonna get back into it next segment, please tell your friends and family to tune in because, yeah, this could start World War 3
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.600]  Or they call that really the Cold War, World War 4
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:47.600]  I want Trump to get the peace prize, I want to have freedom on the Korean Peninsula
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:54.600]  We want to see all these things happen, but this radical Islamic takeover, our life with the Socialists
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:59.600]  And the left has to be crushed, it has to be defeated, it's an admitted plan
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:05.600]  And so let's digress into that for a few minutes of this segment, then we'll get back into the main meat of this investigative report
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:07.600]  You're breaking down live here, Mike Adams
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.600]  The alliance between the left and orthodox radical Islam
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:16.600]  And the fact that in parliamentary countries with 15 major parties, you know, 7 or 8 that are dominant
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:23.600]  10, 15, 20% Islamic voting mass who almost all vote together and are allied with the left, that's a takeover of all of Europe
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:24.600]  We're almost there
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:28.600]  Europe is almost lost, Western Europe at this point
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:40.600]  And you look at the criminalization that they've done to members of government and law enforcement officers who dare say that these rapes are happening by immigrants or refugees and so on
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:44.600]  They're being criminalized, they're being silenced, they're being shut out of their jobs
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:46.600]  Look at what's happened in the UK
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:55.600]  Look at now the immigration enforcement officer or policy officer is now I believe a Muslim who's running that
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:58.600]  And of course the Mayor Khan of London
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.600]  Is bringing in Sharia law
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:03.600]  That's exactly what it is, and it is a takeover
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.600]  And it's all done in the name of inclusiveness and openness and peace
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:09.600]  You see that's the thing, they can always talk about
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:11.600]  But they're not inclusive, I mean, notice that
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:18.600]  A gentleman gets up and points out, hey, I'm from Malaysia, the Muslims are arresting people that even criticize in any way they're taking over
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:21.600]  That was even a majority Muslim country 50 years ago
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:26.600]  They take over everywhere, most of the crime here is Muslims, they shut him down and don't respond
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:32.600]  But anybody, any citizen, there are many citizens in Western Europe that agree with what you're saying and your analysis here
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.600]  But when they speak up then they are criminalized, right?
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:37.600]  So where's the openness?
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:38.600]  There's no openness
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:42.600]  You must accept this, being overrun, you know, 100 years from now
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:49.600]  Historians will look back and they'll say, remember when Western Europe actually had, you know, Europeans?
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:52.600]  It's a slow motion Constantinople
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:55.600]  Yeah, yeah, you know, the ebb and flow of history
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:59.600]  Where cultures take over and lose ground and take it over again
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:02.600]  And sometimes that ebb and flow takes centuries to unfold
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:04.600]  But we're looking at one right here
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:07.600]  And all the Muslims have been doing is expanding
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:09.600]  That's all they do is expand
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:13.600]  They always act friendly until they get 20% and then they start killing your ass
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:17.600]  And then they make a deal with your government to roll over and then they become dominant
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:19.600]  And then your wives are slaves
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:25.600]  But what's even more frustrating is that you are no longer allowed to believe in your own nation anymore
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.600]  Because then that's called nationalism and that's called racism
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:34.600]  So if you love America or if you love your country of the United Kingdom or Germany or Spain for that matter
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:36.600]  And you want any of your culture to be respected
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:38.600]  You're open, but you say our culture is okay
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:39.600]  You are evil
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.600]  They're even getting rid of EU level teams that mention nation names
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:45.600]  You're evil if you love your country
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:46.600]  That's what it is
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:52.600]  Yeah, here's the old Italian guy getting thrown out of his little hotel for African Muslims
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:54.600]  We'll be right back with Mike Adams
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:01.600]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I know to go out and check the top side to see what they say
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:05.600]  And they have talked about for decades that a lot of the mental disorders
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:11.600]  A lot of the behavioral disorders, a lot of the autism spectrum disorders are in the gut
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:16.600]  From the diets and vaccines that trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:21.600]  That then create major toxicity in the gut, causing toxicity in the brain
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:23.600]  Here's a big BBC report today
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:25.600]  How bacteria are changing your mood
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:27.600]  If you have the wrong ones, you're depressed
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:29.600]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's been sold out for months
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:36.600]  MycoZX is back, antifungal, anti-east, anti-candida, that goes in and knocks out the walls in your intestines
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:38.600]  Where these things colonize it and put a slime wall in
[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:41.600]  But the nutrients go through, they get what they want first
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.600]  They colonize you, then they secrete toxins in you
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:45.600]  They cause depression
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:48.600]  They can even secrete toxins when they want more sugar
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:49.600]  This is well known
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:51.600]  Nukem with MycoZX
[02:05:51.600 --> 02:06:03.600]  Exclusively at InfowarsLive.com
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:06.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:22.600]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfowarsLive
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:26.600]  If you just joined us, ladies and gentlemen, Mike Adams is an engineer
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:28.600]  He's an award-winning journalist
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:31.600]  And he's got the floor for the rest of the hour, if need be
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:34.600]  Because he's breaking down
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:37.600]  What's behind the Iran deal? What's it really signify?
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:42.600]  It's a window into the Obama globalist Islamic takeover plan
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:44.600]  And what the Arab Spring was designed to do
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:47.600]  To collapse the Middle East, to open up Europe's borders
[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:50.600]  To flood them with an Islamist invasion
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:52.600]  You've got the pope behind it
[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:56.600]  You've got all these different French politicians pushing it
[02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:59.600]  Saying not one crime's ever been committed by a Muslim
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:01.600]  On and on and on, Sarkozy just said that
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:06.600]  So you're about to get the full spectrum of the transfer of our technology to Iran and others
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:09.600]  And what the master double-cross plan is
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:14.600]  And what Mike, who's a great tactician, thinks Trump's doing
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:16.600]  That's got the globalist so upset
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:19.600]  At least with this alliance with Saudi Arabia right now
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:21.600]  Who's real bad as well
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:24.600]  So Mike, recap and then lay it out
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:28.600]  I'm going to recap for those joining us in the third hour here on the Alex Jones show
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:31.600]  But by the way, you mentioned this a couple of days ago
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:37.600]  Never forget that Bill Clinton helped enable the transfer of nuclear technology to North Korea
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:41.600]  So we have this history of Democrats taking office
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:44.600]  And exploiting and abusing their positions of power
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:50.600]  To empower and enrich very dangerous nuclear capable countries
[02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:53.600]  That go on to threaten America's interests
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:57.600]  North Korea of course threatened American cities directly
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:01.600]  And Iran has also of course threatened to nuke America
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:04.600]  As well as America's allies such as Israel
[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:05.600]  So this is a pattern
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:09.600]  But until now I think no one has put together connected the dots
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:13.600]  On this pattern of Obama transferring technology, military secrets
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:16.600]  As well as laundering money and gold
[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:19.600]  American gold has been sent to Iran
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:21.600]  In order to help fund their nuclear development program
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:26.600]  The reason this is happening today is because of Netanyahu
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:28.600]  And because of Israeli intelligence
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:31.600]  And that cache of documents that they discovered
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:39.600]  Now we know that Israel intelligence has proven that Iran lied
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:41.600]  That Iran has been running a covert nuclear development program
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:43.600]  So let me just recap very quickly
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:45.600]  We're going to go back to 2011
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:46.600]  That's where we start
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:50.600]  And by the way Alex, thank you for giving me the opportunity to come on this report
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:51.600]  Lay it out
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:53.600]  This is the kind of stuff people need to hear
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:57.600]  December 2011, the RQ-170 Sentinel, the drone, US military drone
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:01.600]  Using advanced military encrypted GPS signals
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:03.600]  Was captured by Iran
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:06.600]  And we were told by the media that it was spoofed using GPS spoofing
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:08.600]  And you laid out how even our own penning on everybody else's
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:09.600]  That's totally false
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:10.600]  That's right
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:12.600]  The Russians came and do it so why did Obama give it to them?
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:14.600]  Obama, we believe, gave them that technology
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:16.600]  Because he was transferring military technology to Iran
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:22.600]  And then in January of 2016 he allowed two navy ships to be captured by Iran
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:26.600]  Those were the Riverine Squadron ships with advanced communications and navigation technology
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:28.600]  They ordered them in there and ordered them to stand down
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:29.600]  This was a setup
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:33.600]  And as I mentioned, Michael Savage also has gone public with that in his book Scorched Earth
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:35.600]  That was a setup
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:37.600]  So we have this pattern here
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:39.600]  Now, the money
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:43.600]  We know that Obama laundered $1.7 billion in cash
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:45.600]  And put it on a cargo plane
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.600]  And had that cargo plane flown into Iran
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:49.600]  This is illegal money laundering
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:52.600]  And if you're wondering why he did it in cash
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:54.600]  You know it came back to him
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:56.600]  Well, some of it did, no doubt
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:58.600]  He's skimming and others are skimming off the top
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:01.600]  But this is just the tip of the iceberg
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:08.600]  In February of 2016, right around the time that he transferred the navy boat technology to Iran
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:10.600]  By staging the capture
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:14.600]  Obama released $100 billion in frozen assets
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:17.600]  As part of the nuclear deal with Iran
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:23.600]  $100 billion, think about how much technology that can fund in terms of covert weapons development
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:25.600]  Delivery systems development
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.600]  Acquiring uranium-235 and other ingredients used for nuclear weapons
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:36.600]  This was Al Jazeera reported that Iran said it now has access to $100 billion worth of frozen assets
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:38.600]  Thanks to Obama
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:45.600]  Now, Obama then also transferred up to $33.6 billion in cash and gold to Iran
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:47.600]  This was a Free Beacon article
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:50.600]  Trump's saying it's $150 billion total now
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:52.600]  Yes, and he's been attacked for that
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:54.600]  But he's very much correct
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:56.600]  Because I've seen that number as well
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:00.600]  We know that just cash and gold was up to $33.6 billion
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:01.600]  Think about that
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:04.600]  Gold, American gold transferred to Iran
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:06.600]  And this was quoted by Mark Dubowitz
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.600]  The executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:15.600]  He said it was a secret transfer of up to $33.6 billion in cash and gold
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:20.600]  That were facilitated by the Obama administration between 2014 and 2016
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:24.600]  And right now, we're going to break down what's really behind all this
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:34.600]  So, we have Obama bypassing all of the regulatory restrictions and electronic transfer restrictions that were in place globally
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:40.600]  Obama could not transfer money to Iran through the existing systems
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:44.600]  He had to launder the money like a drug dealer, like a criminal
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:49.600]  And by doing so, he was able to bypass all of the scrutiny
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:50.600]  Now, think about this, Alex
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:57.600]  Can you imagine if Donald Trump laundered $33 billion in money and gold and gave it to anybody?
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:59.600]  He would be called a traitor
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:01.600]  He would be called a treasonous actor
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:04.600]  But Obama did this and got away with it
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:06.600]  We have the cash on the cargo plane
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:07.600]  We have the gold
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:12.600]  Mark Dubowitz said, did any of this money go through the formal financial system?
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:16.600]  If so, the administration is not being truthful about the $1.7 billion
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:19.600]  He violated a bunch of federal international law doing this
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:21.600]  And then you've got him funding the Arab Spring
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.600]  You've got CNN promoting at MSNBC
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:27.600]  You've got hundreds of millions now confirmed through Kenya and his cousin
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:32.600]  Going up to put radical Islamists in charge to basically start a civil war
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:35.600]  While he's secretly arming Iran
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:38.600]  So again, we're getting close to why are they doing this?
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:42.600]  Next step, he sought to supply Iran with nuclear fuel
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:50.600]  Christina Fernandez del Kirchner says that the Obama administration approached her
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:53.600]  And she and her administration met with Gary Samour
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:13:00.600]  And they were told to provide nuclear fuel to Iran by the Obama administration officials
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:03.600]  This was part of the Iran nuclear deal
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:05.600]  They were laundering uranium fuel
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:06.600]  And here's how they were doing it
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:14.600]  They were telling Iran to send non-refined, low-grade uranium fuel to Russia for processing
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:20.600]  And then Russia would turn around and give highly refined, processed nuclear fuel back to Iran
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:26.600]  Russia was also, through uranium-1, getting nuclear fuel from U.S. mining companies
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:29.600]  And that deal was enabled by none other than Robert Mueller
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:31.600]  Hillary Clinton
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:35.600]  Who also met secretly on the tarmac giving the Russians a sample
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:37.600]  I mean, you cannot make this up
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:39.600]  And so again, Argentina was involved in this
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:42.600]  And by the way, you look at France
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:46.600]  Over a decade ago, France was also supplying nuclear fuel to Iran
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:49.600]  Hell, they were doing that when they took the shot out in 79
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:53.600]  Yes, 78, but let's expand on all this briefly
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:57.600]  This is why they started saying Russia, Russia, Russia during the campaign
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:01.600]  Because they knew they had been selling out in this big secret deal
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:04.600]  And so they knew Trump was coming for them on this, like he is
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:06.600]  And that's why they put this whole smoke screen out
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:07.600]  Well, exactly
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:09.600]  And Obama was trying to start World War III
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:11.600]  And he was trying to destroy Israel
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:18.600]  Because remember that Obama oversaw government grants of $350,000 to fund the campaign infrastructure to overthrow Netanyahu
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:20.600]  So further, it's not that Israel is perfect, folks
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:23.600]  Some people go, because it's such a big trendy thing to hit Israel
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:25.600]  They've got different parties, they're not perfect
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:27.600]  But here's the deal
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:30.600]  In the current alliances, it came out in the WikiLeaks
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:33.600]  Two years ago that George Soros wants to destroy Israel
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:35.600]  And turn it over to the Muslims and the Vatican
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:38.600]  So you've got the Muslims with the Vatican and the EU and the Chinese
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:42.600]  In this global alliance against everybody else
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:44.600]  And so that's where we're going with this
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:47.600]  Is this incredible treachery
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:52.600]  So the State Department under Obama gave $350,000 to this group in Israel
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:54.600]  Called Victory 15 or V-15
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:58.600]  And the whole point of this group was to defeat Netanyahu
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:04.600]  And Obama is the same person who is now complaining about the Russians interfering in US elections
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:05.600]  Even though he was trying to-
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:06.600]  And now they couldn't do that
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:11.600]  They start the same corruption stuff with rogue prosecutors of Netanyahu
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:13.600]  The exact same playbook
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:15.600]  Exactly, it's the same thing over and over again
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:18.600]  So now from 2015 on, under the cover of Obama
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:22.600]  Who said that Iran will not be able to acquire nuclear weapons for over 10 years
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:25.600]  The covert nuclear development program actually continued
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:28.600]  Through the funding provided by Obama
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:32.600]  And with nuclear fuel that was also laundered through Obama's pressure on other countries
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:34.600]  We tie it all together on the other side
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:36.600]  And what the globalists are so scared of
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:39.600]  And why they're fighting for their lives as this begins to come out
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:42.600]  And Trump's going to bring all this out now in the next phase
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:46.600]  I've got that from the highest levels and Mike Adams doesn't even talk to me about my sources
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:49.600]  He's right here presenting what I know is already coming
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:16:14.600]  Huge evidence of Obama and Iran in a global plan for war

[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:47.600]  And remembering that it's not just you that's already awake
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:51.600]  But it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:19:20.600]  And thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:25.600]  They began studying this effect in published trials
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:28.600]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:33.600]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:36.600]  Pollen block is natural and effective
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:38.600]  It is not an antihistamine
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:43.600]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:47.600]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:50.600]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:55.600]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets
[02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:02.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:04.600]  You
[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:38.560]  But what's really been going on in the Iran deal, not what you're hearing about not getting nuclear weapons
[02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:43.100]  It's about giving them nuclear weapons and building them up for the giant war a
[02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:51.180]  Clash of civilizations between Shiite and Sunni out of which will come the total collapse of the region into Europe
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:54.520]  But first I
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:20:57.240]  Tell our new TV affiliates
[02:20:57.860 --> 02:20:59.620]  That when they pick us up
[02:20:59.620 --> 02:21:05.080]  Do you want us to do a press release or tell folks or you just tell people locally because you're gonna get a few phone
[02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:09.180]  Calls a few threats a few boycott claims. None of it does anything and
[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:13.240]  Most of them say yeah, let's just test you and see how it goes
[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:17.340]  When I said we have over a hundred TV stations. That was a few months ago. I
[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:26.680]  Can now tell you that TV station wise it's over 300 and we're on over a hundred and fifty different cable systems right now
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:32.700]  Now that's about 50 or so cable owners, but just this new deal is seven counties
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:37.260]  three cities dozens of towns and it got picked up by
[02:21:38.220 --> 02:21:40.220]  200 plus publications
[02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:46.380]  Which the station and the cable systems want but some of these cable feeds are also on local TV
[02:21:47.660 --> 02:21:49.340]  Our plan
[02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:53.300]  To not just have our own cable channel that everybody does and then nobody watches it
[02:21:53.300 --> 02:21:58.500]  But was to go directly to the stations if you agree to be on a cable channel, then suddenly you're not allowed to be on TV
[02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:01.140]  That's how they control it all. I bypassed it all
[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:03.740]  I've had this plan for years that we finally done it
[02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:06.660]  And we're going right to TV stations
[02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:12.300]  So we're on low peg channels in the top 50 channels on almost all these stations
[02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:15.900]  And then most of them own TV stations were on those as well
[02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:18.580]  I don't even want to because I'm afraid they're gonna say they hit team to kill us
[02:22:18.580 --> 02:22:24.420]  That's why there's sodas are coming after it's because I mean it's like every month hundreds more and it's it's really happening
[02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:29.440]  But if you're watching on one of those tell your friends your neighbors your family put a bumper sticker up
[02:22:29.780 --> 02:22:36.900]  You become a local sponsor of the cable station, whatever. It's very inexpensive going to restaurant or something go through a few thousand down a month on a local cable
[02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:43.260]  That's how we fight back against George Soros and the globalist, but here it is Alex Jones in full war show now available live on
[02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:46.500]  30a television
[02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:50.820]  It's this 30 a broadcast excuse nine counties on the
[02:22:51.420 --> 02:22:57.540]  Northwest, Florida panhandle nationwide on Roku TV Amazon Fireplay mobile devices on and on and on
[02:22:57.540 --> 02:23:05.020]  So so that's nine counties and a whole bunch of big cities and towns and then it gets on to the broadcast TV the cable all of it
[02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:06.100]  So
[02:23:06.100 --> 02:23:08.540]  Here's the deal. There's so many of these I can't keep track
[02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:13.940]  This is just the cable and TV owner is really happy with the huge coverage
[02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:21.780]  They're getting this is CBS News reporting on it. So again, I've not been telling folks what's going on the last year very quietly
[02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:25.500]  But the enemy already figured it out. So I like the stealth attack might go ahead
[02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:32.300]  Well, the reason your show is increasingly popular is because exactly, you know, the kind of thing that we're talking about here today
[02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:36.460]  You can't get this reporting on legacy media. They won't touch it
[02:23:36.460 --> 02:23:41.220]  They're told what to say and they will not tell you the truth about these issues these big issues
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:45.380]  A global war issues, you know issues that threaten our national security
[02:23:45.380 --> 02:23:50.420]  That's why it's so important that info wars continues to expand and that's why by the way, you know, I'm contributing
[02:23:50.420 --> 02:23:54.820]  If you don't mind me plug, I got a show on Sunday evenings here at info wars comms called counter think
[02:23:55.460 --> 02:24:01.260]  Counter think it airs at 6 p.m. Central and we got a new episode each week with a new guest every week
[02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:07.180]  So, you know, that's a great show and again these station owners and no do not plug you have a show with us. How horrible
[02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:15.020]  No, pick up counter think Sunday at 6 o'clock Central 7 o'clock Eastern 5 o'clock Mountain a 4 o'clock Pacific
[02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:19.900]  Mike Adams and what's great is these station owners and these network owners and they get it
[02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:24.060]  These are the owners. They know we're being lied about they know we're being demonized and they're saying
[02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:30.940]  When they came after us when Soros and Hillary came after us the support just turbocharged. Yeah, that's what's cool
[02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:34.180]  This is so organic where you know, you and I just get together
[02:24:34.180 --> 02:24:39.260]  I say Alex I could I can do a show and and you're like, okay, do a show do whatever you want to do
[02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:42.020]  Name it whatever you want to name it get whatever guess you want
[02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:45.900]  That was I'm knowing you for 10 years and trust you and so okay. We came up with a name
[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:48.620]  We get the guess we're recording the shows, you know
[02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:54.020]  They're pre-record shows and they air every Sunday and believe me the stuff we have coming out in the next few episodes
[02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:56.540]  It's as hard-hitting as this and again
[02:24:56.540 --> 02:25:00.180]  It's so exciting because if I see bullies ganging up with somebody and attacking them
[02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:04.580]  I go to the raid well these station owners and managers and everybody already liked this
[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:06.780]  But when they saw the attack and they know it's lies
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:12.460]  Yeah, the American in them the human in them the man in them the woman in them is saying no, we're gonna fight
[02:25:12.460 --> 02:25:19.660]  We're not let them shut down free speech in America. I know that every attack that's aimed at you is gonna be aimed at me, too
[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:23.780]  It's gonna be aimed at every independent media publisher every independent
[02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:31.580]  Journalist every independent thinker in America and we all have to stand up and defend the right to speak the right to think the
[02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:35.260]  Right to tell the truth about real news and you've launched a whole website
[02:25:35.260 --> 02:25:38.260]  That's awesome just about this so tell folks about the website for counter thing
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:41.620]  Well, it's it's being switched over to the new video format. It's called counter think calm
[02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:48.020]  It'll carry every episode that you're doing plus like you do I'm recording some short segments in my home studio
[02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:52.740]  That are just breaking news little segments that also support counter think and then every Sunday
[02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:56.580]  We have the newest episode from Info Wars and then when that success will expand that
[02:25:57.140 --> 02:26:03.900]  Right, I mean, let's be clear you have over 300 major websites. You're as successful as we are probably more so you've been under the radar smart
[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:06.900]  smartly that's a word but now
[02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:11.320]  Because the censorship of stuff you're launching your own big gargantuan media platform
[02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:15.540]  Yeah, look, we're all doing everything we can to provide alternative platforms of free speech
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:22.300]  You know, we're launching real that video and things like this group of TV and and and cable stations in Florida that we're so
[02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:27.420]  Supporting they're all re-putting out everything. We do as well. Everybody should go there to their platform to watch it
[02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:29.420]  All our listeners should go to
[02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:33.380]  WWW dot 30 a TV that's three zero a TV
[02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:39.020]  Everybody should support this house the big picture here that I better get back to this report. We'll do that after the break
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:41.020]  We're already far the big picture is
[02:26:41.660 --> 02:26:46.180]  Info Wars and independent media is the future of the real media in America
[02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:52.020]  The legacy media is collapsing and if you don't believe that just look at the clips from the White House Correspondent's dinner
[02:26:52.020 --> 02:26:55.820]  I mean these people are vile militia was unwatchable nasty
[02:26:55.820 --> 02:27:01.780]  It's unreal and they all applauded they loved it. They loved the jokes from that that vile comedian. What's her name wolf?
[02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:07.260]  They are imploding they are crashing they're they're losing all credibility
[02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:12.260]  The new credibility is with the new media with a real they get the Streisand effect
[02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:16.420]  People know the lies about us on the news and the constant immunization isn't true
[02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:19.460]  Or even if they don't they know the media lies and they go we better find out
[02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:23.300]  So the station owners go to hear who I am and they go this is pure Americana
[02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:29.500]  Yeah, exactly exactly people want to hear this message people want a different point of view from the legacy media
[02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:32.220]  Which is all the same obedient, you know
[02:27:32.220 --> 02:27:36.460]  That's why it's so boring is they put out talking points and then everyone just repeats them
[02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:42.500]  We don't have talking points right our talking point is the truth and it's so cool is like like with the show
[02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:48.140]  You know you didn't tell me what I have to say or not say or cover none of that even this report today
[02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:52.460]  You know I did this with my team and I bring it in I briefed you on it before the show
[02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:58.980]  So you know the the bullet points, but you trust me as an independent researcher to do intelligent analysis
[02:27:58.980 --> 02:28:02.620]  It's organic. This is real news people. This is how it really works
[02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:08.180]  That's all another thing. I had the liberals threatening to sue me about use the term real news claiming they own it
[02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:09.260]  We went and looked at the court case
[02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:13.580]  They argued with their trademark that it's organic so that no one is allowed to have it
[02:28:13.580 --> 02:28:18.460]  And we're like we'll go ahead and sue us. I mean it's like they want to say Jones admits. He's not real news
[02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:21.580]  Okay, and that's another thing I hadn't told you about no
[02:28:21.580 --> 02:28:27.620]  I mean they are that stuff well the good news is the good news is they withdrew their Charlottesville lawsuit knowing it was fake
[02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:31.340]  I'm sure they're real we follow whoever but the point is notice no coverage of that
[02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:37.340]  Well real news by definition is independent decentralized news independent thinkers independence and by the way
[02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:39.340]  That's what they say the motto of
[02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:45.380]  Of WWW dot three zero ATV 30 ATV ish and so this is awesome
[02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:49.500]  Hey, we're gonna be right back with Mike Adams to finish up this powerful presentation

[02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:31.220]  My name is Kevin ship. I'm a former decorated CIA officer

[02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:42.180]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government
[02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:47.540]  We got to get this out because just because you're awake folks doesn't mean other people are this is critical to get to read a given
[02:29:47.540 --> 02:29:53.060]  Library to give you the church get them right now at killing uncle Sam book calm killing uncle Sam book calm

[02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:16.900]  And as a long-time infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force
[02:30:17.260 --> 02:30:20.860]  Anthroplex my girlfriend would like to say thanks for the anthroplex. Thank you
[02:30:20.860 --> 02:30:26.380]  I use the bio true selenium the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans

[02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:42.940]  Absolutely, we because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women
[02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:49.660]  Understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves
[02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:51.780]  We can take our country back
[02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:53.780]  I
[02:30:55.620 --> 02:30:58.800]  Was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up
[02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:05.340]  And I got some bad news for the second time in the five and a half year history of survival shield x2 our flagship product
[02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:09.820]  We are having supply chain problems and this may be the last batch of this
[02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:12.320]  We have deep earth crystal source
[02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:19.220]  It's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form
[02:31:19.220 --> 02:31:26.020]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies
[02:31:26.020 --> 02:31:30.100]  And also drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market
[02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:32.380]  They start jacking up the price
[02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:36.460]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out
[02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:38.900]  Hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago
[02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:41.700]  It's not an issue and we do get more but right now
[02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:46.900]  We are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine in the world
[02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:49.060]  But what it does is for stamina libido?

[02:32:54.640 --> 02:33:05.840]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:26.080]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:31.640]  Live from the info wars comm studios. It's alex jones
[02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:37.520]  So again, we're getting hundreds and hundreds of new cable and TV affiliates
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:40.200]  We're very very thankful to all of them. I
[02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:43.120]  Don't tend to sit there and brag about them
[02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:47.080]  Until I'm able to talk to the owners and strategize to make sure that's what they want
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:50.360]  Because again, there'll be some bullying that goes on to try to scare them
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:52.200]  But again, it's a paper tiger
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:58.080]  But these owners and folks know if they don't stand up against the bullying we're going to lose a whole shooting match
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:03.200]  You have any words on that Mike Adams what you got a you know piece through strength
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:08.600]  You know the Ronald Reagan approach to diplomacy if you're not strong if you don't show that you're strong
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:16.120]  You're going to be steamrolled the bullies are out to get you constantly and the way to win that fight is to stand your ground
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:18.360]  assert your rights and
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:23.120]  Punch back when you have to and that that's I mean look Donald Trump does that
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:28.600]  How do you think Donald Trump was so successful in New York real estate and all the real estate deals he did you think he's a
[02:34:28.760 --> 02:34:32.080]  Wimp you think he's just a piece of charming and nice
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:37.000]  Until you attack him a lot of just right all the time. No, he's nice
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:43.840]  But then when you attack him he's vicious and that's that's the way that that I treat people to very very polite very cordial
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:45.680]  But you attack me
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:52.040]  You're you're in for a fight. You know what I mean, and you're the same way you treat people, you know off air in the studio
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:56.960]  You know you treat people nicely and politely, but if somebody attacks you you're gonna stand your ground
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:00.040]  You're gonna punch back you're gonna return fire so to speak, you know
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:04.840]  That's a that's a metaphor or maybe in the real world if somebody were to you know physically attack
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:08.600]  You would punch back physically to no doubt about it. I'm the same way
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:12.760]  I mean, you know, I carry I carry a weapon here in your studio all the time
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:19.440]  We're glad you do to defend us. Absolutely that job comes in. He's gonna have to go through me exactly
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:23.360]  So you're not a victim and that's what this is all about. We're not bitching about corruption in the world
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:25.480]  Just a complaint and say oh we're losers
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:30.320]  We believe in you and we believe when we expose all this you're gonna take the right action
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:36.120]  Just briefly speaking of that if you're watching us on local TV or local cable or you're listening to us on local radio
[02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:40.640]  Just tell the station. Thank you or becoming a sponsor or telling your friends about it
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:45.160]  That changes the world. That's why we're growing people get a response. They get ratings
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:50.040]  But they're also doing it to save the country and that's why these station owners and managers are doing this
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:54.760]  So let them know and financially support info wars folks. We're under attack
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:36:00.400]  It's the money that will stop them dead in their tracks countering the globalist. We're winning. Thanks to you

[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:14.320]  Illegal alien invasion George Soros crossing point where they want to start this stampede like they did out of Middle East and Africa and Europe
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:18.880]  They're trying to cause that same same stampede you using women and children to hold up
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:24.920]  No one asked why Mexico is not taking them Mexico knows why it'll cause a giant collapse of collapsed countries into them
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:29.600]  So this is a UN globalist borderless program and so they couldn't get up there
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:35.000]  So without me telling them to I said they're contractors. I said I'm telling you as info wars
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:39.320]  They got a lot of courage. Don't do it. She already got attacked in Charlottesville and everywhere else
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:44.440]  So they're now going into the Mexico side. They should be there by the time the fourth hour starts
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:48.280]  That's when Watson's hosting those live feeds. We'll just tell them just go live feeds
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:53.040]  Those will be on info wars.com when Watson goes off or something really bad starts happening
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:56.040]  We'll cut into his feed with that and then they'll be on the war room live
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:01.480]  Millie Weaver and Gavin Wins everybody pray for them at the site of the globalist invasion
[02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:05.000]  They're on the California Mexico border now. We got five minutes here ten minutes coming up
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:10.960]  You've got the floor. Okay, just briefly one minute recap and then lay out what's really behind the Iran deal and what the plan was
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:16.400]  Okay, the the quick recap on this is of course we talked about how Obama deliberately allowed the technology of
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:24.960]  military technology transfer to Iran by allowing them to capture a US drone actually probably flying it right into Iran's runways and
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:32.000]  also transferring the US Navy technology by having those two ships captured and creating an international
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:38.320]  embarrassment for the United States that was right before Obama had his state of the Union speech by the way that year
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:46.840]  2016 we also talked about how Obama then laundered money and transferred up to thirty three point six billion dollars in cash and
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:51.920]  Gold to Iran in order to fund their nuclear weapons development program
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:55.640]  Which has now been uncovered by Israel and Netanyahu
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:39:00.320]  So during this entire time of course Obama was also interfering with Israel's elections
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:07.840]  Giving government grant money to an anti Netanyahu group called v-15 that sought to defeat Netanyahu in the elections
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:12.080]  Now moving on because I'm gonna wrap this up here in the next few minutes pay attention
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:17.480]  This is this is really hard-hitting. You're gonna realize just what a traitor Obama has been. This is the meat of the matter
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:25.580]  So the secret nuclear weapons development program continued under Obama from 2015 on it was
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:34.760]  Undertaken it went covert, but as Netanyahu has revealed they continued to engage in quote designing nuclear weapons
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:38.640]  Developing nuclear cores building nuclear implosion systems
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:45.480]  preparing nuclear tests and integrating nuclear warheads on missiles those are five key functions that every nuclear
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:50.080]  Capable a weapon system program must pursue and they were all being pursued
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:55.120]  Under Obama's so-called agreement that claimed to be depriving
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:59.440]  Iran of these nuclear weapons now Obama knew
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:04.720]  At the same time that Russia was providing nuclear know-how to Iran
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:10.240]  I'm gonna say that again Obama knew that Russia was providing nuclear expertise to Iran
[02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:12.480]  This came out in a John Solomon article
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:16.880]  From the Hill comm in March of 2018. Excuse me. He says
[02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:23.600]  He talks about William Douglas Campbell telling the Hill that his evidence included Russia was intercepting non-public copies of
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:27.440]  International inspection reports on Tehran's nuclear program
[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:34.520]  In other words to show that they were compliant with Obama even though it was all being fudged and at the same time
[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:39.960]  Russia was sending equipment advice and material to a nuclear facility inside Iran
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:46.160]  This was happening at the same time that the uranium uranium one scandal was breaking in the United States
[02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:53.440]  Which Robert Mueller the current special counsel helped cover up in order to provide cover to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:56.960]  William Douglas Campbell talked of a payment network a
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:05.160]  covert underground payment network to move funds between Russia and Iran with kickbacks to Americans which we can
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:08.480]  Safely assume would include the Clinton Foundation
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:16.160]  Which is one of the most egregious criminal organizations in the history of nonprofit and before that even existed
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:17.840]  They were instrumentalist
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:19.840]  president co-president in
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:26.600]  96 and 97 transferring the ICBM the Merv technology the detonator systems the launch
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:32.000]  Systems to North Korea. Yes, the Clintons have given more weapons
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:39.320]  Of the ballistic missile and atomic type more the fissile material more the know-how more the reactors than the Chinese did
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:42.120]  Campbell at your exactly right
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:49.240]  We got about a minute left in this segment Campbell added that he became concerned the United States was providing favorable decisions to the Russian nuclear
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:56.520]  Industry in 2010 and 2011 under Obama clearing the way from Moscow to buy large U.S. uranium assets and
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:03.920]  And secure billions in nuclear fuel contracts, and he reported even has he reported evidence of Moscow's help to Iran
[02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:08.600]  This was of course revealed in the Clinton cash book by Peter Schweitzer as well
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:10.840]  so Robert Mueller
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:14.600]  James Comey has some involvement in this as well and
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:23.760]  This goes deep. This is the entire deep state that is now trying to destroy Trump is involved in this deal to give weapons
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:28.520]  to to Iran now we come back then we're going to discuss why
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:32.480]  Because this isn't just about Iran have a right to a nuke or not
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:38.200]  This is about deep state globalist manipulations. This stuff went on thinking. I don't want to be enemies with Russia
[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:41.440]  But the truth is they did come in they did buy off the company. They did buy off Hillary
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:47.920]  They did buy off, you know Tony Podesta this this all went on and then they turn around and say we're all Russian agents
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:53.680]  And Maxine water says you're all guilty. No lady. You're guilty. You're guilty
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:59.680]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:05.560]  Seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body

[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:21.120]  I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:24.960]  But it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people a hundred two hundred dollars
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:32.000]  For the formula and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers non-gmo

[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:25.040]  Alex Jones here back live with the health ranger Mike Adams counter think
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:33.540]  Counter thinking counter to the establishment thinking for yourself. That's next level free thinking what will say hey Kanye West
[02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:39.640]  Used to be a Democrat. He did all this stuff. It doesn't matter. He's promoting free thinking. He's under attack. He has courage
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:44.360]  You know so many people we put on the map that we have on the broadcast
[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:49.720]  Later get a gig at Fox News or even a guest on it and Fox News says don't go on Alex Jones a show
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:53.600]  And I see them years later when I have their Fox contract and they go mad
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:56.840]  I didn't really get a response on Fox. They only paid me a little bit of money every year
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:02.880]  It's like 30 40 grand. They have tens of thousands of people. I mean, I know it's thousands on their payroll just that are controlled by them
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:06.400]  They because they want to control the entire conservative fear
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:11.240]  I'm not trying to get other people on the show because I need them on the show most of the time
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:16.400]  It's because I'm trying to launch them to a wider audience because they're articulate and smart now with Mike Adams
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:18.680]  That's a different kettle of fish altogether
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:22.880]  This guy knows a lot more than I do on most subjects and we're glad to have him doing counter think
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:29.880]  Every Sunday right after my broadcast ends at six o'clock central and he's gonna have this even more focus
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:36.240]  I won't be here interrupting this Sunday getting into this and more so finishing here for people that just joined us
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:41.400]  Trump is upset because we're talking 33 plus billion in golden cash
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:44.960]  another hundred billion in assets
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:52.480]  Billions more in cash. We're learning about Trump says about 150 billion and it's part of this Obama operation
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:58.560]  Funding the Muslim Brotherhood funding the fall and downfall of different countries funding the opening up of Europe
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:02.040]  There's a larger global plan and then laundering money
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:10.000]  Back to himself at the Clinton Foundation. All these documents have come out. It's it's bold. It's outrageous. It's Lex Luthor level
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:13.340]  supervillain behavior. So looking at this now
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:19.160]  This could bring the down their syndicate as this stuff comes out and the alliance
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:22.320]  But let me ask you this. What are you from your research? I've got my view
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:26.320]  What were they planning of this thing with Iran all went through or didn't get exposed?
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:29.400]  That's still ongoing. What were they planning?
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:35.960]  You can say all day Netanyahu's got problems or whatever. He you know, he said there were WMD's when there weren't you know back in 2002 or whatever
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:42.800]  Soros in the secret documents that have come out wants to overthrow Israel the Vatican wants to overthrow it
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:47.520]  They want they they say it's a Muslim future. They're breaking down the borders. So here's the deal. I
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:49.720]  Know there's an Israel lobby
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:56.120]  It's a diverse group that there's this mental illness online by conservatives and liberals that you're a free think review hate Israel
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:01.880]  And that's the touchstone. None of the Muslim countries will take the you know, five million Palestinians. Most of them aren't Palestinians
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:06.940]  They've got you know, millions of open-air air-conditioned tents Saudi Arabia won't take them
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:10.840]  They won't take one. So here's the deal the globalist have
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:16.760]  1.3 billion people ready to invade Europe. They're having six kids on average by 2030. That's
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:22.040]  Three billion Muslims. They are coming as an authoritarian force to make me submit
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:28.080]  So real law is already going into Europe 10 years ago. I would hear this stuff. I knew the globalist work with radical Islam
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:33.680]  But I didn't believe it when I heard all the caliphate stuff in Turkey and they're gonna collapse the border and the Muslims are gonna out
[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:40.120]  Vote us. I didn't understand it was parliamentary. So even 10% can take over through a parliament. It's true. It's the plan
[02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:45.640]  It's happening. I'm all in to stop it. We will stand for the West. We will stand for real
[02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:50.680]  Classical liberal policies. We will stand for true open societies with true open people
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:54.620]  We will stand against a cult of authoritarianism that abuses women
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:58.840]  Enslaves them murders gays you name it and I will say to the so-called
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:03.360]  Liberal lobby the the sorcerers the Soros is all of you
[02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:09.280]  All you left is that point your finger at me and say I'm a big meanie and I'm a bigot and I'm a Nazi
[02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:16.640]  You're allied with Islam that to a man and woman was allied with Hitler who also wanted this demographic and wanted to do this
[02:51:16.640 --> 02:51:21.440]  This is a the EU is a Hitler plan. They are following a Hitler plan
[02:51:21.960 --> 02:51:23.320]  Junkers
[02:51:23.320 --> 02:51:25.320]  Grandfather was the richest man in the Reich
[02:51:25.840 --> 02:51:32.280]  Junker aircraft you Junker munitions his dad was a Nazi officer Junker is a Nazi. He's a globalist
[02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:38.120]  The grandson of the richest Nazi runs the unelected EU and his ally with Islam
[02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:41.520]  This is happening again and the poor German people
[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:48.720]  The engine of Europe have to finance this whole thing. They hate it just like the Nazis got control the German people again
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:56.320]  Through intimidation control and everything they've got the Germans against we're facing a replay of what happened in World War two right now
[02:51:56.320 --> 02:51:59.240]  So so why do you think this is happening? Who are the power players?
[02:51:59.440 --> 02:52:05.680]  What what needs to happen Mike Adams the the big picture is the destruction of the United States of America and
[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:11.240]  This has been going on for decades with Bill Clinton transferring technology to North Korea
[02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:17.220]  Look at the technology transfers to China. They got a three billion person army in 12 years. It's ready to suicide bomb
[02:52:17.440 --> 02:52:23.120]  Yeah, we need 200 foot walls. We notice they let them in and then take all of our rights
[02:52:23.320 --> 02:52:28.000]  Just like just like the French president you said, oh, we need more security
[02:52:28.080 --> 02:52:31.440]  We're gonna arrest men that sexually harassed but the Muslims never did anything wrong
[02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:35.360]  They bring it in they take our rights because of the threat they leave the borders open
[02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:40.400]  This is a planned takeover these people are traitorous enemies. Sorry Mike. I'm ranting. It's okay
[02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:48.440]  It's a multi-faceted attack and you're absolutely right and I'm saying wake up. This is World War four. We're under attack raising alarm. Damn it
[02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:57.000]  Obama's goal was to give Iran nuclear weapons and for Iran to use those nuclear weapons against Israel
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.960]  I'm convinced no question about that whatsoever
[02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:06.880]  And as they got longer and longer ranges on their ballistic missiles for Iran to be able to threaten other countries they can already hit Moscow and
[02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:12.280]  And maybe one day the United States if they get the technology that North Korea has but
[02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:15.280]  You're absolutely right Alex. This is critical
[02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:17.680]  Let me let me just wrap this up because there's a couple of wrap it up
[02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:24.760]  And then and what do you think the calculus is between this Saudi Arabia and then the Shiites in Iran and and the global deal
[02:53:24.760 --> 02:53:29.240]  How do they think they're gonna control a three billion person army? Yeah, okay
[02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:31.200]  first of all
[02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:33.200]  Info wars reported this as
[02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:38.960]  Well, we talked about we talked about how the deep state was covering all of this up while Obama was giving
[02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:42.880]  Nuclear aid to Iran through nuclear fuel
[02:53:43.320 --> 02:53:49.200]  money as well as technical allowing technical know-how to arrive in Iran from Russia the
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:55.240]  Through the Russian collusion with President Trump's campaign and Julian Assange at WikiLeaks tweeted a WikiLeaks release State Department
[02:53:55.480 --> 02:53:56.600]  Cable
[02:53:56.600 --> 02:54:05.000]  Documenting that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ordered Robert Mueller to deliver a sample of stolen highly enriched uranium to Russia in
[02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:08.520]  2009 that's reported by info wars and then Roger Stone
[02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:11.200]  Chimes in from a Daily Caller article in
[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:18.080]  2017 he says he talks about how the president has to order a special counsel to investigate the Obama Clinton
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:20.200]  Mueller-Rosenstein criminal collusion
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:24.400]  he calls it that enriched the Clinton Democrat crime syndicate and
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:30.840]  Embedded the power of the deep state operators who facilitated the multi-billion and we need that last year
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:34.080]  We need this now. That's right. And then finally
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:37.560]  When Mueller was FBI director in 2010
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:44.960]  Members of an interagency committee working under Obama facilitated a business deal that had grave public implications
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:47.120]  This is also from Roger Stone in Daily Caller
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:52.260]  The result of it was that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton effectively handed Russia and Vladimir Putin
[02:54:52.260 --> 02:54:56.380]  Control over as much as 20% of the Iranian and so here's the question
[02:54:56.380 --> 02:55:03.920]  Why are what was the strategy long-term and a break breakdown short-term mid-term long-term and where you think Iran is right now?
[02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:06.420]  What the new power configuration?
[02:55:06.860 --> 02:55:13.060]  Constellation is because now with Trump there is real tectonic collision long-term plan was to gut
[02:55:13.420 --> 02:55:21.260]  America's tactical advantage by transferring military technology to Iran and other countries and then to give Iran nuclear
[02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:28.820]  Capability through funding that was laundered by Obama into Iran to entice them towards a first strike
[02:55:32.660 --> 02:55:34.020]  No question
[02:55:34.020 --> 02:55:39.820]  No question that Iran has talked about a first strike. Well under Aquadena did of course
[02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:46.460]  Now not quite as much as I'm asking what is the insane calculus of giving Iran weapons and then doing all this
[02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:54.460]  What is the point? It's Alex. It's revelation. It's in revelation man. It's it's the it's the Russia Iran attack on Israel and
[02:55:54.660 --> 02:55:58.940]  The the defensive nuking of Damascus in Syria. That's all in revelation
[02:55:58.940 --> 02:56:05.020]  I mean it's all been written out of how this would play out and Obama has been feeding
[02:56:05.380 --> 02:56:10.020]  The destructive nuclear side of this think about the thing Obama funded
[02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:12.140]  Iran's nuclear
[02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:19.860]  Program he transferred us military technology. He covered up for Iran. He fueled the nuclear weapons development through enriched
[02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:27.500]  Fuel transfer he whitewashed their Russia's nuclear fuel acquisition and technology transfers to Iran and then Obama
[02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:31.100]  Conspired with America's enemies to give them power
[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:36.740]  While hurting America and at the highest global level then what's the next step after that?
[02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:42.500]  Well, of course, it's it's the complete destruction of the United States of America. You win occupation. That's it
[02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:48.340]  Yeah, it's the destruction of the West. They're gonna just start race wars here and a sabbatholdy stabilized
[02:56:48.460 --> 02:56:54.060]  Well, Europe deals with the big crisis of a collapse man leased and then and then out of that comes the one-world government
[02:56:54.060 --> 02:57:01.580]  And I hope up there saying peace love turning your guns on the pope at the same time Obama was also inciting racial tension in America and
[02:57:02.180 --> 02:57:05.380]  Evoking a race war in he was running the Arab Spring
[02:57:05.380 --> 02:57:13.340]  Yeah, absolutely Obama was systematically seeking to destroy America from so its classic Jacob and Illuminati worldwide revolution
[02:57:13.340 --> 02:57:16.660]  And it fits the constitutional definition of treason
[02:57:18.340 --> 02:57:21.780]  Obama is a criminal against America is a criminal against humanity
[02:57:22.500 --> 02:57:25.620]  Yeah, that that too. So there you go. Alex. That's my report

[02:59:51.300 --> 03:00:05.780]  We are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:00:22.300 --> 03:00:31.340]  All right in three minutes Paul Joseph Watson from London, England takes over with a huge raft of breaking news and
[03:00:32.100 --> 03:00:36.340]  Information Mike Adams. We just did an hour and 15 minutes or so
[03:00:36.940 --> 03:00:40.060]  Breaking all of this down. What's really behind Iran?
[03:00:40.140 --> 03:00:46.580]  What's really behind the so-called deal that Obama did and where this is all leading you made a point during the break
[03:00:46.580 --> 03:00:50.420]  That was critical that Obama what's horrifying about this is Obama still has power
[03:00:50.420 --> 03:00:54.580]  He's still active from his so-called bunker. He's still calling a lot of shots
[03:00:54.900 --> 03:01:02.020]  He is not being indicted for these obvious acts of treason against America that spanned many many years of his entire presidency
[03:01:02.140 --> 03:01:05.820]  if anyone needs to be investigated indicted and
[03:01:06.660 --> 03:01:11.980]  Imprisoned if found guilty by a jury it's Barack Obama and his co-conspirators
[03:01:11.980 --> 03:01:17.500]  Which include by the way Robert Mueller and Hillary Clinton that is the upshot of this realization here
[03:01:17.500 --> 03:01:21.220]  And he's still even in the news on most of Trump's trips
[03:01:21.220 --> 03:01:26.460]  He follows around behind him with three jets and as soon as Trump leaves
[03:01:26.780 --> 03:01:30.860]  He shows up and then goes and talks to the same leader to sabotage it
[03:01:30.860 --> 03:01:36.740]  Yeah, so it's a permanent deep state trying to hold on and I think Trump's starting to get a little bit of control
[03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:38.260]  But I don't think it's 50 50 yet
[03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:42.700]  And this is such edge of your seat type stuff that I can't describe the listeners and viewers
[03:01:42.700 --> 03:01:45.460]  This is epic. They're trying to derail the peace still with North Korea
[03:01:45.460 --> 03:01:49.540]  They're trying to start a war and and I and I overall do trust Trump
[03:01:49.540 --> 03:01:53.180]  I got mad at him when they struck Syria as I get he's being manipulated into all this
[03:01:53.540 --> 03:01:58.500]  But at a larger level I had a gut level still trust Trump. He's done so much good
[03:01:59.100 --> 03:02:03.380]  That doesn't mean I won't disagree with him when he's wrong, but just overall, you know a man by his enemies
[03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:05.380]  And what are you thinking from well?
[03:02:05.980 --> 03:02:12.380]  Obama still wants to destroy America and Trump absolutely wants to save America from that destruction
[03:02:12.380 --> 03:02:19.000]  That in a nutshell is what you need to realize Trump is doing everything in his power to try to prevent the absolute destruction of
[03:02:19.180 --> 03:02:25.340]  America and he's being fought tooth and nail by the deep state by people like Obama by the fake news media and other
[03:02:25.500 --> 03:02:31.500]  Covert operatives inside the system that are trying to destroy him or assassinate him and shut off all voices that are pro-trump
[03:02:31.500 --> 03:02:32.660]  So so there you go, Alex
[03:02:32.660 --> 03:02:38.100]  That's the situation we're in and it's a total war and I've never seen anybody lay it out is just cut and dry as that
[03:02:38.100 --> 03:02:43.940]  They're coming after everybody that stands for the Republic for free market for family for sovereignty for decency
[03:02:44.060 --> 03:02:49.580]  These are globalists. They want to conquer us through pure power. They want to use surplus even if it bankrupts everything
[03:02:49.580 --> 03:02:53.660]  They they started World War one and World War two to bring in the UN
[03:02:54.380 --> 03:02:57.380]  They are the enemy of humanity, but nationalism and
[03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:02.060]  Populism is awakening and we have a chance to fight it out this morning
[03:03:02.060 --> 03:03:05.140]  I had some high-level phone calls with some of the most high-level folks in Europe
[03:03:05.140 --> 03:03:09.300]  I mean right at the top of the rebellion and they it's
[03:03:09.820 --> 03:03:15.260]  Folks that it's gonna say who people can figure it out the point is a lot of exciting things are going on and
[03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:20.380]  This is the real deal. Yeah, and we're surrounded, but thank God we can now attack in all directions
[03:03:20.380 --> 03:03:25.980]  But we're not surrounded overall because of you taking action now Paul Joseph Watson from London, England
[03:03:25.980 --> 03:03:28.180]  Tell us what you've got coming up in the next hour my friend
[03:03:28.180 --> 03:03:35.140]  Hi Alex. Yeah, we're gonna turn our attention back to the culture war and back to Millennials and Generation Z
[03:03:35.420 --> 03:03:38.060]  Because you probably covered this but there's a new poll which shows
[03:03:38.820 --> 03:03:45.940]  Democrats are hemorrhaging support amongst Millennials. They've lost nine percentage points in support amongst Millennials since
[03:03:46.260 --> 03:03:50.180]  The end of 2016 alone. So in less than a year and a half
[03:03:50.380 --> 03:03:55.180]  You would think that that would be there, you know, their key target audience. They're losing it in droves
[03:03:55.180 --> 03:03:59.860]  We've also got why young Millennials actually want more traditional marriage roles
[03:04:00.220 --> 03:04:07.100]  Basically, the last 10 years of third wave feminism trying to scramble gender roles has completely and utterly failed
[03:04:07.380 --> 03:04:10.660]  Young people are saying they want more traditional roles, you know
[03:04:10.660 --> 03:04:16.180]  Women doing certain tasks men doing others both equally both important tasks for this whole
[03:04:17.060 --> 03:04:20.940]  Re-induction program in terms of gender looks like it's completely failed
[03:04:20.940 --> 03:04:28.060]  Which is why Alex I say over and over again conservatism is a new counterculture because if you make hating America
[03:04:28.060 --> 03:04:33.260]  If you make 72 genders the dominant culture, then you're gonna have a backlash against it
[03:04:33.260 --> 03:04:37.380]  So we're gonna get into that during the fourth hour exactly. It's a biological plan
[03:04:37.380 --> 03:04:43.740]  They admitted it all to basically break up the family atomize everything for depopulation also new study reveals loneliness
[03:04:43.740 --> 03:04:51.860]  Epidemic levels in America. That's the smart phones all of it. Paul Watson coming up

[03:06:09.580 --> 03:06:17.620]  This is Paul Joseph Watson hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show on this May the first
[03:06:18.740 --> 03:06:22.700]  2018 edition we're gonna get into the migrant crisis what's happening in Europe
[03:06:22.700 --> 03:06:27.860]  Obviously, that's a subject that I talk about on a regular basis being right here in the middle of it
[03:06:27.860 --> 03:06:34.740]  But first we're gonna get into what's happening with the culture war and with the war for the minds of the youth because we have this
[03:06:35.020 --> 03:06:37.980]  article out of information liberation headline
[03:06:37.980 --> 03:06:44.820]  Paul Dems hemorrhaging support among millennials lose nine points in just two years
[03:06:45.060 --> 03:06:47.900]  That's right. The Democrats thought that they would continue
[03:06:48.020 --> 03:06:53.340]  God only knows how they thought it would be a success with this identity politics platform
[03:06:53.340 --> 03:06:59.180]  Which is no platform at all and that they would continue to attract young voters. It's not working
[03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:01.580]  It's just not working
[03:07:01.580 --> 03:07:10.740]  Articles states Democrats are hemorrhaging support among millennials according to a new poll from Reuters Ipsos their biggest losses are among young white men
[03:07:11.700 --> 03:07:20.820]  Why do you think that is because they're continually attacked in the popular culture who went from favoring Democrats over Republicans 48 to 36 in
[03:07:21.460 --> 03:07:24.180]  2016 to favoring Republicans over Democrats
[03:07:25.020 --> 03:07:27.020]  46 to 37 in
[03:07:27.020 --> 03:07:33.500]  2018 so they've lost nine percentage points since the end of 2016 alone
[03:07:34.300 --> 03:07:35.740]  Now on top of this, of course
[03:07:35.740 --> 03:07:42.140]  We have other articles that we've previously covered other studies which prove that generation Z is the most
[03:07:42.460 --> 03:07:47.740]  Conservative generation since World War two and again whenever we talk about this kind of thing
[03:07:48.100 --> 03:07:52.100]  The comedy centrals of the world the salon comms of the world come out and say oh
[03:07:52.100 --> 03:07:59.940]  So you're saying that the new cool hip trendy thing to be is to worship the establishment GOP is to love Mike Pence
[03:08:00.380 --> 03:08:06.100]  Now it's not about that. Obviously there's been a fissure in the Republican Party over the last few years
[03:08:06.100 --> 03:08:13.260]  Which is broken away from that staid sterile establishment perspective. That's not what we're talking about
[03:08:13.500 --> 03:08:19.180]  We're talking about the fact that the left are the new Puritans trying to literally ban everything
[03:08:19.180 --> 03:08:25.420]  From offensive songs to cheerleaders to page three girls to formula one grid girls
[03:08:26.180 --> 03:08:34.100]  That's why young people are turning away from them because they see that that kind of mindset is joyless is self-inhibiting
[03:08:34.460 --> 03:08:39.260]  And it's frankly not cool. I mean, why do you think Kanye's come out with all this?
[03:08:40.540 --> 03:08:44.780]  Rhetoric in the culture war recently and why it's resonating with a lot of people
[03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:51.220]  Because it is seen as counterculture to go against the grain and be a conservative on Twitter
[03:08:51.220 --> 03:08:58.180]  I mean the mass outrage from Kanye West merely supporting the sitting president of the United States
[03:08:58.500 --> 03:09:01.140]  From the dominant cultural media
[03:09:01.740 --> 03:09:07.100]  Institutions says everything you need to know about who is still in control of the dominant culture
[03:09:07.100 --> 03:09:11.740]  You can't be the dominant culture and the counterculture. It doesn't work that way. Sorry
[03:09:11.740 --> 03:09:13.740]  article continues
[03:09:14.740 --> 03:09:16.740]  the online survey of more than
[03:09:17.260 --> 03:09:24.140]  16,000 registered voters ages 18 to 34 shows their support for Democrats over Republicans for Congress slipped by about nine
[03:09:24.780 --> 03:09:26.980]  percentage points over the past two years
[03:09:27.700 --> 03:09:33.620]  46% overall and they increasingly say the Republican Party is a better steward of the economy
[03:09:34.420 --> 03:09:36.660]  So they're becoming more fiscally conservative
[03:09:36.660 --> 03:09:43.140]  Although nearly two of the three two out of three young voters poll said they do not like Republican president Donald Trump
[03:09:43.860 --> 03:09:47.140]  Because of obviously, you know, 90% negative media coverage
[03:09:47.620 --> 03:09:54.740]  That is taste for him does not necessarily extend to all Republicans or translate directly into votes for Democratic congressional
[03:09:55.180 --> 03:09:56.260]  candidates
[03:09:56.260 --> 03:10:00.540]  So again, this proves that whatever you think of Donald Trump, whatever they think of Donald Trump
[03:10:00.540 --> 03:10:08.780]  Democrats aren't reaching out with a message that resonates not just with young people, but with anyone. They don't have policies
[03:10:09.380 --> 03:10:15.500]  It's all about virtue signalling and identity politics still are still here in May
[03:10:16.180 --> 03:10:19.420]  2018 and that's all they've got and that's not a platform
[03:10:20.100 --> 03:10:23.020]  It wasn't a platform in 2016. It isn't one now
[03:10:23.860 --> 03:10:29.860]  Article continues this presents a potential problem for Democrats who have come to count on millennials as a core constituency
[03:10:29.860 --> 03:10:37.820]  And will need all the loyalty they can get to achieve a net gain of 23 seats to capture control of the US House of Representatives in November
[03:10:38.660 --> 03:10:45.740]  The shift away from Democrats was more pronounced among white millennials who accounted for two-thirds of all votes cast in that age group in
[03:10:46.140 --> 03:10:53.340]  2016 and if you go to the original information liberation article, which we posted up on informers.com this morning
[03:10:53.340 --> 03:11:00.820]  It suggests a few reasons why young white millennials aren't so hot on the Democratic Party and the left in general
[03:11:01.260 --> 03:11:07.460]  Given that they get bashed from pillar to post in the dominant culture in the media on a day-to-day basis
[03:11:07.620 --> 03:11:11.180]  Where it's seen as cool where it's seen as the last
[03:11:12.020 --> 03:11:17.900]  Outpost of acceptable racism to be racist to collectivize young white men
[03:11:18.540 --> 03:11:20.540]  exact same thing happens in my country
[03:11:20.540 --> 03:11:25.580]  Where they claim that we have white privilege and in fact the the most successful
[03:11:25.980 --> 03:11:29.500]  people in terms of money in terms of starting businesses or
[03:11:30.260 --> 03:11:34.340]  Generally speaking immigrants Indian immigrants white middle-class
[03:11:34.900 --> 03:11:42.580]  Particularly boys young men are at the bottom of that rung. So why do you think across European countries and in America?
[03:11:42.780 --> 03:11:47.220]  They're losing the vote of young white male millennials
[03:11:47.220 --> 03:11:54.540]  This is huge nine percentage points lost in November the Democrats thought they had this in the bag
[03:11:54.540 --> 03:11:56.540]  They thought it was a gimme. It's not
[03:11:56.940 --> 03:12:01.940]  People are being driven away from them because they're turned off from this identity politics message
[03:12:01.940 --> 03:12:06.780]  Which is why I say over and over again. I get messages every day more than ever before
[03:12:07.140 --> 03:12:13.940]  Compare this to like three four years ago complete contrast from young people who resonate with my message
[03:12:13.940 --> 03:12:17.780]  Who resonate with the message of people who are similar to me saying similar things to me?
[03:12:17.940 --> 03:12:25.580]  They're 16 17 18 19 20 year olds in school in college. They say this is the new form of rebellion
[03:12:25.580 --> 03:12:30.300]  I mean eventually I guess it will become the dominant culture and it won't be the counterculture anymore
[03:12:30.300 --> 03:12:32.300]  But right now it is seen as
[03:12:33.380 --> 03:12:38.380]  effervescent in terms of the culture war to be I mean conservative is
[03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:42.820]  Simplifying it to a to a great degree. It's not just about conservatism
[03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:46.860]  It's more about cultural libertarianism, which is how it was defined a couple of years ago
[03:12:47.620 --> 03:12:54.460]  When you become the new puritans when you become the new sensors when you shut down free speech when you shut down music
[03:12:54.460 --> 03:12:59.420]  When you shut down movies when you shut down art, which the new left has become
[03:12:59.420 --> 03:13:02.460]  There are very few actual classical liberals left
[03:13:02.860 --> 03:13:09.100]  Then of course you're gonna get a backlash to that and we're seeing that not only in the culture to some degree
[03:13:09.100 --> 03:13:13.860]  But also now in politics with Democrats hemorrhaging millennial votes
[03:13:15.420 --> 03:13:20.740]  We also have this article headline why young millennials actually want more traditional marriage roles
[03:13:21.660 --> 03:13:27.420]  Now this proves again that third wave feminism has completely and utterly failed completely failed
[03:13:27.420 --> 03:13:33.220]  Not only is the word feminism seen as a pejorative by a majority of people if you look at polls
[03:13:33.220 --> 03:13:40.860]  Even women in many countries the majority of women the majority do not identify as feminists
[03:13:40.860 --> 03:13:47.460]  Certainly the majority of people in general do not identify as feminists and this is another exploration into that
[03:13:48.380 --> 03:13:54.880]  Article reads women have fought hard decade after decade to make society a more equitable place from the workplace to the home
[03:13:55.820 --> 03:14:02.220]  Continues regarding the study, which is called trending towards traditionalism changes in youth gender ideology led by
[03:14:02.220 --> 03:14:06.260]  Joanna Pepin a PhD student sociology at the University of Maryland
[03:14:07.020 --> 03:14:12.060]  They examined 40 years of data on the attitudes of high school seniors views on family
[03:14:12.820 --> 03:14:14.820]  Relationships and work. What did they discover?
[03:14:15.580 --> 03:14:19.300]  Well, they know in their report while we might expect each generation to get more
[03:14:19.740 --> 03:14:28.100]  Progressive whatever that means now literally now that means like worshiping the hijab and creating cry closets for people who get offended by ideas
[03:14:28.140 --> 03:14:30.740]  That's that's the new definition of progressivism
[03:14:30.740 --> 03:14:36.220]  This has today's young millennials are reaching back in time when it comes to women's roles at home
[03:14:36.340 --> 03:14:39.140]  They also believe women should be equal to men in the workplace
[03:14:39.300 --> 03:14:46.180]  Warnings to the study 42% of high school seniors in 1994 felt that it was to the benefit of families for men
[03:14:46.540 --> 03:14:50.900]  To be breadwinners while women cared for the home this number increased
[03:14:51.660 --> 03:14:56.140]  15 percentage points to 58% in 2014
[03:14:56.140 --> 03:15:03.780]  So what that their figures are from four years ago is probably even higher now, so it went from 42% of high school seniors
[03:15:04.340 --> 03:15:06.780]  believing basically in traditional gender roles to
[03:15:07.500 --> 03:15:09.220]  58%
[03:15:09.220 --> 03:15:11.220]  supporting traditional gender roles in
[03:15:11.940 --> 03:15:13.060]  2014
[03:15:13.060 --> 03:15:17.580]  This is despite the relentless onslaught of propaganda
[03:15:18.300 --> 03:15:20.300]  Reeducation re indoctrination
[03:15:20.620 --> 03:15:22.620]  scrambling of gender roles, you know
[03:15:22.620 --> 03:15:28.860]  72 different genders and all that insanity which we've seen accelerate over the past five ten years and
[03:15:29.460 --> 03:15:31.140]  Definitely over the past
[03:15:31.140 --> 03:15:32.940]  15 20 years
[03:15:32.940 --> 03:15:36.780]  So that is absolutely huge young people millennials
[03:15:37.300 --> 03:15:42.580]  Gen Z's are not buying the indoctrination. In fact, they're rebelling against it
[03:15:42.740 --> 03:15:47.420]  And that is going to be a huge problem for the social engineers going forward
[03:15:47.420 --> 03:15:55.060]  This is the Alex Jones show live breaking news info wars dot com. We'll be back healthcare reform is confusing

[03:20:20.220 --> 03:20:24.620]  Well, it is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show in the next segment
[03:20:24.620 --> 03:20:29.420]  We're gonna play a new video which I just completed which went up on info wars.com about an hour ago
[03:20:29.420 --> 03:20:31.780]  It's called what they're not telling you about London
[03:20:32.660 --> 03:20:36.500]  Specifically the real causes of the violent crime wave that we've experienced
[03:20:36.580 --> 03:20:43.420]  Not just in London across the whole of the UK over the past year or so the media will never talk about the true causes
[03:20:43.420 --> 03:20:47.700]  If we don't uncover the true causes, how are we gonna get to the solutions?
[03:20:47.700 --> 03:20:53.780]  This this is the only compilation that I've seen that actually documents it. We're gonna play it in the next segment
[03:20:54.180 --> 03:20:57.700]  Now we're gonna switch to Europe though gonna talk about the migrant crisis. Oh, by the way
[03:20:57.700 --> 03:21:02.420]  I wanted to read a couple of quotes out just bookending that culture war discussion
[03:21:03.060 --> 03:21:07.460]  We see a smattering still a smattering as small
[03:21:08.260 --> 03:21:14.300]  smattering of liberals actual liberals who still resist this onslaught of woke
[03:21:15.700 --> 03:21:19.060]  Culture war propaganda indoctrination Rob Schneider
[03:21:19.940 --> 03:21:25.220]  Came out and talked about late night comedy, which is a subject that I've discussed off the back of you know
[03:21:25.220 --> 03:21:31.780]  Comedy Central basically creating a whole show based around attacking info wars the opposition which is
[03:21:32.140 --> 03:21:37.580]  So incredibly unfunny it makes Michelle Wolf look absolutely hilarious in comparison
[03:21:37.780 --> 03:21:41.340]  But Rob Schneider has called this out because as I mentioned in that video
[03:21:41.700 --> 03:21:47.380]  All the new cool popular comedians are anti PC anti identity
[03:21:47.660 --> 03:21:52.180]  Politics people like Joe Rogan Bill Burr Ricky Gervais even Roseanne
[03:21:52.180 --> 03:21:56.900]  The Pete the people who people want to watch are all in that same vein
[03:21:57.300 --> 03:21:59.300]  Meanwhile, you have a lot of people on the left
[03:21:59.740 --> 03:22:04.580]  Going down this identity politics politics route going down this safe route where they're so
[03:22:05.180 --> 03:22:07.180]  petrified of offending anyone
[03:22:07.940 --> 03:22:14.380]  That they can't they can barely even write a punchline anymore. It's so pathetic. It's so sterile
[03:22:14.380 --> 03:22:18.780]  It's so boring and Rob Schneider's called that out. This is a quote
[03:22:18.780 --> 03:22:26.740]  Which is in a Fox News interview from today. I believe he said quote much late night comedy is less about being funny and more about
[03:22:27.260 --> 03:22:29.860]  indoctrination by comedic in position
[03:22:31.020 --> 03:22:36.260]  So again comedy is supposed to be about making people laugh. It doesn't matter. It's in the context of comedy
[03:22:36.260 --> 03:22:41.820]  You can be offensive. Oh, no, you can't if you teach your pug dog to do a Nazi salute
[03:22:41.900 --> 03:22:43.900]  You get sentenced as a criminal
[03:22:43.900 --> 03:22:49.980]  But in the olden days, you could actually be offensive as long as you were trying to make people laugh Schneider continues
[03:22:51.100 --> 03:22:56.180]  People aren't really laughing at it as much as cheering on the rhetoric
[03:22:56.940 --> 03:23:02.140]  It no longer resembles a comedy show. It's more like some kind of liberal clan meeting
[03:23:03.620 --> 03:23:05.540]  And that's exactly it, isn't it?
[03:23:05.540 --> 03:23:12.460]  It's all about this rah-rah pushing one side of the parties and divide and again, there are no right-wing comedy shows
[03:23:12.460 --> 03:23:19.700]  I mean, they'd like this what Steven Crowder on YouTube. There are no big right-wing comedy shows on broadcast television
[03:23:19.860 --> 03:23:27.140]  Okay, so you still control that dominant cultural outpost and you've completely destroyed it
[03:23:27.220 --> 03:23:31.460]  Like it's not even potent anymore because you stopped being funny
[03:23:32.260 --> 03:23:41.100]  You're so panicked about offending anyone walking on eggshells from one punchline to the next your comedy is crap
[03:23:41.100 --> 03:23:48.100]  It's not funny and Rob Schneider's pointed that out in that quote there. He was talking about Saturday night live
[03:23:48.780 --> 03:23:53.940]  Which you know, they used to bash both sides to some extent now with Baldwin and his ilk
[03:23:54.140 --> 03:23:58.940]  It's basically descended into Trump derangement syndrome like everything else
[03:23:59.460 --> 03:24:04.140]  Which you know, you wouldn't be that bad if they also bash the other side at the same rate
[03:24:04.140 --> 03:24:08.220]  But they don't it's not funny because they're so petrified of causing offence
[03:24:08.220 --> 03:24:13.420]  Which is why the only funny comedians that are left are the ones who aren't afraid of that
[03:24:13.940 --> 03:24:15.940]  You also had another comment from
[03:24:16.780 --> 03:24:21.180]  Simpsons creator Matt Groening. I think he's how you pronounce it. I'm not sure on that
[03:24:21.220 --> 03:24:25.980]  But he was the creator of the Simpsons obviously on this whole Appu controversy
[03:24:26.380 --> 03:24:30.660]  With the obviously the Indian shopkeeper character in The Simpsons The Simpsons
[03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:33.340]  send up lambast
[03:24:33.380 --> 03:24:34.620]  ridicule
[03:24:34.620 --> 03:24:41.900]  Statterize every single nationality you can imagine French people Germans Americans British every single one you can imagine
[03:24:41.900 --> 03:24:49.460]  Oh, but as soon as they do it to an Indian guy for the past what 30 plus years now or now it's a problem because we have to
[03:24:50.180 --> 03:24:56.620]  Reinvent the way we look at everything. We have to filter everything through this lens of identity politics now
[03:24:57.060 --> 03:25:01.540]  Which is why they're literally trying to ban old movies and stuff like that complete insanity
[03:25:01.540 --> 03:25:04.500]  He said about this Appu controversy
[03:25:04.700 --> 03:25:08.740]  It's a time in our culture where people love to pretend
[03:25:09.300 --> 03:25:16.940]  They're offended and this is why it still has some cash a obviously because people just get up on social media on Instagram on Twitter and
[03:25:18.020 --> 03:25:21.780]  Moral grandstand about it to make themselves look woke
[03:25:22.620 --> 03:25:24.620]  Progressive caring
[03:25:24.620 --> 03:25:27.300]  Humanitarian of course if you delve down into these people's character
[03:25:27.300 --> 03:25:33.060]  They're normally the most nasty divisive people you could ever wish to encounter horrible depressed
[03:25:33.740 --> 03:25:39.620]  Self-loathing people those are the biggest virtue signalers. What does that tell you about their character?
[03:25:39.740 --> 03:25:45.060]  But it's good to see people like Matt Groening and Rob Schneider who are obviously liberals in a classical sense
[03:25:45.620 --> 03:25:53.140]  Railing against this politically correct takeover of comedy of art of entertainment because it's making everything boring
[03:25:53.140 --> 03:26:01.600]  And it has to stop and we we can take licks on both sides whether you're a conservative liberal whatever fair enough like when people got
[03:26:02.780 --> 03:26:06.860]  People got I mean some conservatives got up in arms about other conservatives
[03:26:07.140 --> 03:26:13.340]  You know criticizing this Michelle Wolf monologue at the National Correspondence dinner, but it wasn't funny
[03:26:13.340 --> 03:26:19.300]  He was objectively not funny. She was slurring half of the words. She sounded completely drunk
[03:26:19.300 --> 03:26:26.220]  She sounded like some dumb valley girl. She could barely get the punchlines out and when she did they weren't even funny
[03:26:26.220 --> 03:26:33.060]  They fell completely flat you had a sycophantic audience of Trump haters that we're gonna go for and clap whatever she said
[03:26:33.060 --> 03:26:36.260]  I mean, I if it was genuinely funny fine
[03:26:36.260 --> 03:26:42.260]  I'm not gonna not gonna be triggered. I'm gonna be triggered by comedy, but it was so crap. It was so crap
[03:26:43.060 --> 03:26:45.380]  Because the left has forgotten how to be funny
[03:26:45.380 --> 03:26:50.900]  That's why they're losing control of comedy just like they're losing control of popular culture in general
[03:26:50.900 --> 03:26:58.180]  They still control it, but it's slowly starting to slip and they're slowly starting to get panicked about it
[03:26:58.420 --> 03:27:00.580]  So I just wanted to highlight those two quotes
[03:27:02.140 --> 03:27:04.140]  Moving on though
[03:27:04.220 --> 03:27:10.500]  President Macron of France has come out and said that migrant violence terror is Europe's fault and not linked to mass immigration
[03:27:10.500 --> 03:27:20.060]  So basically he came out and said that because there were some terror attacks and some sexual assaults in Europe
[03:27:21.060 --> 03:27:22.620]  before
[03:27:22.620 --> 03:27:30.180]  2018 basically he's going back to 2012 that that means that none of them have any connection to the new migrant crisis
[03:27:30.180 --> 03:27:36.220]  Well, I mean look look at the perpetrators of the mass molestation of women in cologne on New Year's Eve 2015
[03:27:36.220 --> 03:27:43.100]  Okay, they were majority Moroccan asylum seekers direct correlation between the migrant crisis
[03:27:43.180 --> 03:27:48.060]  Look at ISIS propaganda. Look at the terror attack in France the pan the Paris massacre
[03:27:48.540 --> 03:27:54.340]  ISIS bragged they used the refugee wave to infiltrate jihadist fighters into Europe
[03:27:54.340 --> 03:27:59.860]  They're saying they're gonna do that going forward to try to infiltrate millions of jihadists into Europe
[03:28:00.620 --> 03:28:04.100]  We've had numerous people try to blow themselves up in Germany
[03:28:04.100 --> 03:28:09.420]  There's a guy trying to blow himself up outside a music concert Syrian migrant again
[03:28:10.260 --> 03:28:14.820]  Sexual assaults on a daily basis. I'm gonna get some more after this. They see footage
[03:28:14.820 --> 03:28:19.300]  I believe that's out of Spain where they're just roaming onto the beach now Macron's talking about
[03:28:20.220 --> 03:28:22.540]  Inviting in 200 million
[03:28:22.540 --> 03:28:25.540]  African migrants into Europe if you do that Africa
[03:28:26.180 --> 03:28:33.020]  Europe becomes Africa you can't invite 200 million Africans into a continent and not have it changed that continent
[03:28:33.020 --> 03:28:37.980]  So of course this problems exacerbate a because of the migrant crisis
[03:28:37.980 --> 03:28:44.380]  There are innumerable examples to prove that so once again Macron is laying through his teeth
[03:28:44.940 --> 03:28:49.020]  We'll get more into that another migrant news of the European news in the next segment

[03:30:14.720 --> 03:30:17.480]  And so in our own search to get the purest form
[03:30:17.920 --> 03:30:24.280]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies
[03:30:24.280 --> 03:30:28.400]  And also drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market
[03:30:28.400 --> 03:30:34.760]  They start jacking up the price, but we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out
[03:30:34.760 --> 03:30:39.040]  Hopefully just like the last time it's happened a few years ago. It's not an issue and we do get more
[03:30:39.040 --> 03:30:45.160]  But right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine in the world

[03:30:57.720 --> 03:31:04.360]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[03:31:04.360 --> 03:31:12.480]  Including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:16.400]  Researchers in France notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[03:31:16.800 --> 03:31:24.280]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[03:31:24.280 --> 03:31:27.120]  We now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting
[03:31:27.120 --> 03:31:33.960]  Chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective
[03:31:33.960 --> 03:31:40.760]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase
[03:31:40.760 --> 03:31:45.320]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body

[03:32:56.920 --> 03:32:59.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:32:59.800 --> 03:33:06.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Paul Joseph Watson
[03:33:08.240 --> 03:33:12.160]  London has overtaken New York in murders for the first time in modern history
[03:33:12.160 --> 03:33:15.520]  Everyone's acting all bewildered as to what's going on in the world
[03:33:15.520 --> 03:33:20.320]  And now you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Paul Joseph Watson
[03:33:22.240 --> 03:33:26.720]  London has overtaken New York in murders for the first time in modern history
[03:33:26.720 --> 03:33:32.360]  Everyone's acting all bewildered as to why the capital and the UK in general is seeing a surge in violent crime
[03:33:32.360 --> 03:33:38.880]  But it's not a mystery mass immigration political correctness and cultural degradation of the three primary causes
[03:33:38.880 --> 03:33:45.720]  Everyone's blaming Sadiq Khan, but it wasn't Sadiq Khan who told police they couldn't chase criminals on mopeds
[03:33:45.720 --> 03:33:52.320]  That was Theresa May. Yes, she literally told cops not to pursue thugs on mopeds without helmets
[03:33:52.320 --> 03:33:59.360]  Because the criminals might get hurt or babies and what happened moped crime exploded criminals
[03:33:59.360 --> 03:34:03.800]  Literally just driving into outside cafes and swiping laptops and phones
[03:34:03.800 --> 03:34:09.520]  Pedestrians being terrorized assaulted and robbed on the streets and it's all Theresa May's fault
[03:34:09.520 --> 03:34:15.120]  This is what happens when the intellectual elite tries to assuage their metropolitan white guilt
[03:34:15.120 --> 03:34:19.360]  By treating the perpetrators of crime as the victims
[03:34:19.360 --> 03:34:26.360]  Supine cowardice. London's violent crime explosion can be directly blamed on supine cowardice
[03:34:26.360 --> 03:34:30.360]  It wasn't Sadiq Khan who reduced stop and search
[03:34:30.360 --> 03:34:32.360]  That was Theresa May too
[03:34:32.360 --> 03:34:36.360]  Why did Theresa May reduce stop and search? Because she thought it was racist
[03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:41.360]  Because she insisted black kids were being stopped and searched disproportionately
[03:34:41.360 --> 03:34:44.360]  Despite being shown evidence that this was not the case
[03:34:44.360 --> 03:34:52.360]  Ordering police not to profile the most likely violent criminals in the areas where violent crime is most likely to take place
[03:34:52.360 --> 03:34:54.360]  What could possibly go wrong?
[03:34:54.360 --> 03:35:00.360]  A wave of stabbings have given London a higher murder rate than New York City, which is much bigger
[03:35:00.360 --> 03:35:05.360]  On Thursday, 16-agers were stabbed in London in four separate incidents over just 90 minutes
[03:35:05.360 --> 03:35:11.360]  This is what happens when politicians deem virtue signalling to be of more value than law and order
[03:35:11.360 --> 03:35:18.360]  Political correctness. London's violent crime explosion can be directly blamed on political correctness
[03:35:18.360 --> 03:35:22.360]  Oh, but don't for a second think I'm letting Sadiq off the hook
[03:35:22.360 --> 03:35:26.360]  Because Londoners lay bleeding to death in the streets night after night
[03:35:26.360 --> 03:35:28.360]  What was Sadiq more bothered about?
[03:35:28.360 --> 03:35:30.360]  While the blood flowed into the gutter
[03:35:30.360 --> 03:35:34.360]  Khan was pitting about in America complaining about mean tweets
[03:35:34.360 --> 03:35:38.360]  Deport all Muslims and make London white again
[03:35:38.360 --> 03:35:41.360]  Or whining about Donald Trump's retweets
[03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:44.360]  Or whinging about the Tories not providing enough money for police
[03:35:44.360 --> 03:35:50.360]  Let's just be thankful that Khan found enough money to pay for something that Londoners were really crying out for
[03:35:50.360 --> 03:35:52.360]  Transgender bathrooms
[03:35:52.360 --> 03:35:56.360]  Here's another fundamental cause of London's violent crime surge
[03:35:56.360 --> 03:36:02.360]  Black kids are still growing up mired in a degenerate culture that glorifies criminality and violence
[03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:06.360]  Specifically, I'm talking about UK drill rap
[03:36:06.360 --> 03:36:08.360]  This is the music behind the bloodshed
[03:36:08.360 --> 03:36:13.360]  This is the forum through which gangs brag about their stabbings, direct threats at other gangs
[03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:16.360]  And monetize the whole thing on YouTube
[03:36:16.360 --> 03:36:18.360]  Originating in Chicago's south side
[03:36:18.360 --> 03:36:22.360]  Drill rap is now the soundtrack to London's murderous crime wave
[03:36:22.360 --> 03:36:26.360]  Instead of competing on the sports field, these kids compete for kills
[03:36:26.360 --> 03:36:29.360]  Gang members even keep a scoreboard of their triumphs
[03:36:29.360 --> 03:36:31.360]  All publicized on video
[03:36:31.360 --> 03:36:34.360]  If you're in a gang and one boy has stabbed two people
[03:36:34.360 --> 03:36:36.360]  And another stabbed nobody
[03:36:36.360 --> 03:36:38.360]  Then there is peer pressure to go out and do it
[03:36:38.360 --> 03:36:41.360]  Says Chris Preddy, a 24-year-old youth worker
[03:36:41.360 --> 03:36:43.360]  Or as one gang member put it to Preddy
[03:36:43.360 --> 03:36:46.360]  Man's on the score sheet, pom pom pom, dip dip dip
[03:36:46.360 --> 03:36:48.360]  That boy is top of the table
[03:36:48.360 --> 03:36:50.360]  Because he's stabbed six people
[03:36:50.360 --> 03:36:52.360]  It's like Lord of the Flies
[03:36:52.360 --> 03:36:54.360]  But instead of being stranded on a desert island
[03:36:54.360 --> 03:36:56.360]  These kids are cast adrift
[03:36:56.360 --> 03:36:59.360]  In the hopeless malaise of fried chicken shops
[03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:01.360]  And pissed stained stairwells
[03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:04.360]  Some of these threat videos get hundreds of thousands of views
[03:37:04.360 --> 03:37:08.360]  Likes and comments provide dopamine hits for kids desperate
[03:37:08.360 --> 03:37:10.360]  For validation from their peers
[03:37:10.360 --> 03:37:13.360]  So you know what, to borrow a phrase from Donald Trump
[03:37:13.360 --> 03:37:15.360]  London's turning into a shithole under city card
[03:37:15.360 --> 03:37:18.360]  London is what happens when you embolden criminals
[03:37:18.360 --> 03:37:20.360]  By making a mockery of the police
[03:37:20.360 --> 03:37:23.360]  Thanks to decades of leftist hand-wringing
[03:37:23.360 --> 03:37:26.360]  Which demanded more leniency towards scumbags
[03:37:26.360 --> 03:37:29.360]  UK police have been completely emasculated
[03:37:29.360 --> 03:37:32.360]  They're now seen by criminals as a complete joke
[03:37:47.360 --> 03:37:50.360]  When you make a laughingstock of the police
[03:37:50.360 --> 03:37:55.360]  You encourage the cultivation of a clockwork orange-style droog culture
[03:37:55.360 --> 03:37:58.360]  A culture that has no respect for authority
[03:37:58.360 --> 03:38:01.360]  Policing is no longer about enforcing the law
[03:38:01.360 --> 03:38:04.360]  It's about public relations, massaging statistics
[03:38:04.360 --> 03:38:06.360]  And politically correct spin
[03:38:06.360 --> 03:38:09.360]  As one ex-cop put it, in the old days it was different
[03:38:09.360 --> 03:38:11.360]  We were nice to the nice people
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:14.360]  And nasty to the nasty people
[03:38:14.360 --> 03:38:16.360]  Who are the police nasty to now?
[03:38:16.360 --> 03:38:19.360]  Who do they brag about throwing in jail for eight months?
[03:38:19.360 --> 03:38:22.360]  An acid attacker? A crazed knife man?
[03:38:22.360 --> 03:38:25.360]  No, a guy who stuck his middle finger up at a speed camera
[03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:28.360]  I mean, it's not like we've got grooming gangs up and down the country
[03:38:28.360 --> 03:38:31.360]  Abducting and raping kids, is it?
[03:38:31.360 --> 03:38:33.360]  Thank god they caught this dangerous psycho
[03:38:33.360 --> 03:38:35.360]  I feel safer already
[03:38:35.360 --> 03:38:38.360]  I also feel considerably less likely to be violently attacked
[03:38:38.360 --> 03:38:41.360]  Now that these deadly gardening tools are off the streets
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:46.360]  Because a few overgrown weeds and branches is a price worth paying for security
[03:38:46.360 --> 03:38:52.360]  I also feel safer knowing that police response times to playground insults are ruthlessly efficient
[03:38:52.360 --> 03:38:56.360]  I also feel better knowing that women are being protected
[03:38:56.360 --> 03:38:59.360]  From wolf whistling, I also feel safer
[03:38:59.360 --> 03:39:02.360]  Now I know the cops are monitoring mean tweets
[03:39:02.360 --> 03:39:05.360]  I mean, certain groups can literally call for beheading people in public
[03:39:05.360 --> 03:39:08.360]  And they can walk around parliament waving ISIS flags
[03:39:08.360 --> 03:39:13.360]  But don't be unfriendly on Twitter because you might get a visit from the Thought Police
[03:39:13.360 --> 03:39:14.360]  I'm being burgled
[03:39:14.360 --> 03:39:16.360]  I'm sorry sir, we no longer...
[03:39:16.360 --> 03:39:18.360]  The man is being disrespectful towards Islam
[03:39:18.360 --> 03:39:19.360]  Hold on!
[03:39:19.360 --> 03:39:26.360]  I'm assured, when the authorities are busy investigating the ghastly crime of offensive social media posts
[03:39:26.360 --> 03:39:29.360]  At least we can defend our own homes from invasion
[03:39:29.360 --> 03:39:32.360]  Without fear of legal reprisals, right?
[03:39:32.360 --> 03:39:35.360]  Oh no, they're literally arresting pensioners for doing just that
[03:39:35.360 --> 03:39:39.360]  The same pensioners who live under a de facto night time curfew
[03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:41.360]  Because they're so afraid of crime
[03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:46.360]  As Theodore Dalrymple writes, old people would no more venture out after dark in the UK
[03:39:46.360 --> 03:39:51.360]  And Transylvanian peasants in the Hammer horror films about Prince Dracula
[03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:55.360]  The UK's violent crime wave has also been fuelled by mass immigration
[03:39:55.360 --> 03:39:57.360]  Oh don't take my word for it
[03:39:57.360 --> 03:40:02.360]  Listen to what an actual gang member at the centre of it all told the London Evening Standard
[03:40:02.360 --> 03:40:05.360]  In the last ten years, since the Somalis and the Congolese came to London
[03:40:05.360 --> 03:40:08.360]  They taught us a whole new level of violence
[03:40:08.360 --> 03:40:11.360]  These people had seen family members mutilated
[03:40:11.360 --> 03:40:13.360]  So when they said, I'm gonna smash you up
[03:40:13.360 --> 03:40:16.360]  Us guys would be shouting yo blood what you mean
[03:40:16.360 --> 03:40:19.360]  And they would just pull out a blade and juck stab you in the chest
[03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:23.360]  It upped the speed and level for us British born guys
[03:40:23.360 --> 03:40:26.360]  We had to arm up to protect ourselves
[03:40:26.360 --> 03:40:28.360]  It created an upward spiral
[03:40:28.360 --> 03:40:35.360]  Sadiq Khan himself admitted that London's rising population bloated by mass immigration
[03:40:35.360 --> 03:40:37.360]  Was contributing to the violence
[03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:41.360]  The very same liberal politicians who pushed for mass immigration
[03:40:41.360 --> 03:40:46.360]  Are noticeably silent when it comes to being outraged about London's violent crime wave
[03:40:46.360 --> 03:40:49.360]  And that's because it's not their sons being stabbed
[03:40:49.360 --> 03:40:51.360]  It's not their daughters getting acid attacked
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:55.360]  Because they all live in the areas with the least immigrants
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:40:59.360]  The whitest areas, Richmond, Barnes, Kensington
[03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:03.360]  They don't go anywhere near East and South London's hopeless ghettos
[03:41:03.360 --> 03:41:07.360]  They don't have to face the consequences of the policies that they inflict on the rest of us
[03:41:07.360 --> 03:41:10.360]  And where are all the middle class lefty activists?
[03:41:10.360 --> 03:41:13.360]  I thought you were all about black lives matter
[03:41:13.360 --> 03:41:16.360]  Black kids are getting killed on an almost daily basis
[03:41:16.360 --> 03:41:20.360]  Oh you'll protest a visiting president of the United States in your hundreds of thousands
[03:41:20.360 --> 03:41:22.360]  But when it comes to a murder epidemic
[03:41:22.360 --> 03:41:24.360]  Mainly affecting people of color
[03:41:24.360 --> 03:41:26.360]  It's f***ing crickets
[03:41:26.360 --> 03:41:28.360]  The solutions to all this are clear
[03:41:28.360 --> 03:41:32.360]  Implement New York style zero tolerance policing
[03:41:32.360 --> 03:41:36.360]  Make Bill Bratton the head of the Metropolitan Police
[03:41:36.360 --> 03:41:38.360]  Reimplement stop and search
[03:41:38.360 --> 03:41:40.360]  Allow profiling
[03:41:40.360 --> 03:41:43.360]  Allow police to chase actual criminals
[03:41:43.360 --> 03:41:49.360]  Immediately scrap all resources devoted to proactively policing offensive comments on the internet
[03:41:49.360 --> 03:41:54.360]  Seriously, why are you patrolling tweets when you should be patrolling the streets?
[03:41:54.360 --> 03:41:59.360]  Why are you making cops paint their nails and all kinds of other dumb s***?
[03:41:59.360 --> 03:42:00.360]  Stop it
[03:42:00.360 --> 03:42:01.360]  Stop it now
[03:42:01.360 --> 03:42:06.360]  Great Britain was once one of, if not the safest country in Europe
[03:42:06.360 --> 03:42:11.360]  That old cliche about leaving your doors unlocked at night was actually true
[03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:12.360]  Now look at it
[03:42:12.360 --> 03:42:16.360]  A tawdry mess of virtue signalling inept bureaucracy
[03:42:16.360 --> 03:42:18.360]  Nihilistic droog-yutes
[03:42:18.360 --> 03:42:21.360]  Whose existences are so meaningless
[03:42:21.360 --> 03:42:25.360]  Their main goal in life is to top the Premier League table of stabbings
[03:42:25.360 --> 03:42:27.360]  And Keystone cops
[03:42:27.360 --> 03:42:31.360]  Who are being ordered to treat hurt feelings as a bigger outrage
[03:42:31.360 --> 03:42:36.360]  Than bleeding internal organs
[03:42:36.360 --> 03:42:37.360]  There you have it
[03:42:37.360 --> 03:42:39.360]  What they're not telling you about London
[03:42:39.360 --> 03:42:42.360]  It's up on YouTube right now
[03:42:42.360 --> 03:42:44.360]  Please get that video and share it
[03:42:44.360 --> 03:42:46.360]  It is absolutely crucial that you do so
[03:42:46.360 --> 03:42:48.360]  We'll tell you what's happening elsewhere in Europe
[03:42:48.360 --> 03:42:50.360]  With the current state of cultural enrichment
[03:42:50.360 --> 03:42:51.360]  After the break
[03:42:51.360 --> 03:42:53.360]  This is the Alex Germshaw Live info
[03:42:53.360 --> 03:42:54.360]  Fill your body with carnivore
[03:42:54.360 --> 03:42:57.360]  The new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life
[03:42:57.360 --> 03:42:59.360]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process
[03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:02.360]  And increase the bioavailability of nutrients
[03:43:02.360 --> 03:43:05.360]  By breaking down foods into easily absorbable components
[03:43:05.360 --> 03:43:07.360]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion
[03:43:07.360 --> 03:43:10.360]  Caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut
[03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:13.360]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age
[03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:15.360]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes
[03:43:15.360 --> 03:43:17.360]  Like those naturally present in the body
[03:43:17.360 --> 03:43:20.360]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again

[03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:27.360]  Commonly associated with high meat diets
[03:43:27.360 --> 03:43:29.360]  Just one pill with every high protein meal
[03:43:29.360 --> 03:43:31.360]  Helps increase the bioavailability
[03:43:31.360 --> 03:43:33.360]  And absorption of amino acids
[03:43:33.360 --> 03:43:35.360]  The building blocks to your muscles
[03:43:35.360 --> 03:43:37.360]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes
[03:43:37.360 --> 03:43:40.360]  To help digest fats and carbohydrates
[03:43:40.360 --> 03:43:42.360]  So you can fully digest all types of meals
[03:43:42.360 --> 03:43:44.360]  Don't let a meal go to waste
[03:43:44.360 --> 03:43:46.360]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life

[03:44:04.360 --> 03:44:07.360]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme
[03:44:07.360 --> 03:44:10.360]  Carnivore for being able to break down
[03:44:10.360 --> 03:44:12.360]  Meat and other proteins better
[03:44:12.360 --> 03:44:14.360]  And then the other two is a powerful
[03:44:14.360 --> 03:44:17.360]  50 billion live probiotic culture

[03:49:12.320 --> 03:49:14.320]  We've recently found out that we may have a difficult time
[03:49:14.320 --> 03:49:18.320]  sourcing the powerful ingredient in survival shield X2,
[03:49:18.320 --> 03:49:20.320]  which can make the supply limited.
[03:49:20.320 --> 03:49:23.320]  That's why we're providing it now for 25% off
[03:49:23.320 --> 03:49:25.320]  for a limited time.
[03:49:25.320 --> 03:49:28.320]  Also, end of lots of sales beginning of new ones.
[03:49:28.320 --> 03:49:31.320]  Due to availability, we have to end a lot of sales
[03:49:31.320 --> 03:49:33.320]  on your favorite products, but we still want you to be able
[03:49:33.320 --> 03:49:35.320]  to save big while supporting the show.
[03:49:35.320 --> 03:49:37.320]  So we have numerous sales.
[03:49:37.320 --> 03:49:39.320]  Again, I mentioned a few of them there.
[03:49:39.320 --> 03:49:41.320]  True Alpha Mail Combo, which is Super Mail Vitality
[03:49:41.320 --> 03:49:43.320]  and Alpha Power, that's 50% off.
[03:49:43.320 --> 03:49:46.320]  Again, double Patriot points for the rest of the month.
[03:49:46.320 --> 03:49:50.320]  We also have Immune Gargle Combo at 50% off.
[03:49:50.320 --> 03:49:52.320]  These kind of products you're going to buy anyway,
[03:49:52.320 --> 03:49:55.320]  the toothpaste, et cetera, so why not get them from us
[03:49:55.320 --> 03:49:59.320]  and support the growth of this network?
[03:49:59.320 --> 03:50:01.320]  Those massive discounts are available right now
[03:50:01.320 --> 03:50:03.320]  at infowarsstore.com.
[03:50:03.320 --> 03:50:05.320]  Please support us today,
[03:50:05.320 --> 03:50:07.320]  where I'm only dependent on you.
[03:50:07.320 --> 03:50:09.320]  I say it over and over again.
[03:50:09.320 --> 03:50:13.320]  You said on CNN, half the ads are for Gulf State dictatorship.
[03:50:13.320 --> 03:50:15.320]  That's who's paying them.
[03:50:15.320 --> 03:50:18.320]  Pharmaceutical companies, you know, Black Lives Matter groups,
[03:50:18.320 --> 03:50:22.320]  left-wing Soros groups funded by giant globalist checks.
[03:50:22.320 --> 03:50:24.320]  Then you have, you know, conservative networks
[03:50:24.320 --> 03:50:27.320]  that are funded by sponsors which get boycotted
[03:50:27.320 --> 03:50:31.320]  on a regular basis by left-wing mob outrage campaigns.
[03:50:31.320 --> 03:50:34.320]  They can't really do that to us
[03:50:34.320 --> 03:50:37.320]  because everything's in-house and you support us.
[03:50:37.320 --> 03:50:40.320]  You continue to support us over the past few years.
[03:50:40.320 --> 03:50:41.320]  It's been really helpful.
[03:50:41.320 --> 03:50:43.320]  It's enabled us to survive, basically.
[03:50:43.320 --> 03:50:46.320]  We really appreciate it, so please continue to do so
[03:50:46.320 --> 03:50:50.320]  by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:50:50.320 --> 03:50:52.320]  Now, turning back to Europe,
[03:50:52.320 --> 03:50:56.320]  where we have a massive debate now about the return,
[03:50:56.320 --> 03:50:58.320]  basically, of the migrant crisis.
[03:50:58.320 --> 03:51:00.320]  Remember, Angela Merkel and others said
[03:51:00.320 --> 03:51:02.320]  that it was basically over months ago.
[03:51:02.320 --> 03:51:05.320]  Well, now we have this, return of the migrant crisis,
[03:51:05.320 --> 03:51:09.320]  Greece overwhelmed as illegal surge across Turkish land border,
[03:51:09.320 --> 03:51:12.320]  similar to what you see here in the video out of Spain.
[03:51:12.320 --> 03:51:14.320]  Greece is being overwhelmed by illegal migrants
[03:51:14.320 --> 03:51:16.320]  surging across its land border with Turkey
[03:51:16.320 --> 03:51:18.320]  with a local mayor warning.
[03:51:18.320 --> 03:51:21.320]  The situation is on the verge of spinning out of control.
[03:51:21.320 --> 03:51:24.320]  Now, remember, Greece bought the brunt of the 2015 migrant crisis,
[03:51:24.320 --> 03:51:29.320]  815,000 illegal migrants traversing the Aegean Sea.
[03:51:29.320 --> 03:51:33.320]  Now that's starting to pick up again.
[03:51:33.320 --> 03:51:35.320]  The figure was reduced to 30,000 in 2016
[03:51:35.320 --> 03:51:38.320]  after the EU struck a deal with Turkey.
[03:51:38.320 --> 03:51:43.320]  But now, in April alone, almost 3,000 illegal migrants
[03:51:43.320 --> 03:51:45.320]  penetrated Greece's land border
[03:51:45.320 --> 03:51:47.320]  by crossing the Ivoros River in East Thras,
[03:51:47.320 --> 03:51:51.320]  Turkey's last remaining foothold on the European mainland.
[03:51:51.320 --> 03:51:55.320]  That figure is equivalent to half the number of migrants
[03:51:55.320 --> 03:51:57.320]  who arrived in all of 2017.
[03:51:57.320 --> 03:52:01.320]  So the numbers really are spiraling down in Greece.
[03:52:01.320 --> 03:52:03.320]  And these are the consequences,
[03:52:03.320 --> 03:52:05.320]  just two more stories from today.
[03:52:05.320 --> 03:52:08.320]  A Polish boy hospitalised after being attacked
[03:52:08.320 --> 03:52:12.320]  in Berlin, Migrant Suburb, police call it a racist attack.
[03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:14.320]  An 11-year-old boy was brutally beaten
[03:52:14.320 --> 03:52:16.320]  by a group of teenagers in Berlin's
[03:52:16.320 --> 03:52:18.320]  Nicole Migrant Suburb,
[03:52:18.320 --> 03:52:20.320]  Poland's Fact 24 reports.
[03:52:20.320 --> 03:52:22.320]  The boy was taken to hospital after an attack,
[03:52:22.320 --> 03:52:26.320]  according to police, was racially motivated.
[03:52:26.320 --> 03:52:28.320]  You're not going to be reading about it
[03:52:28.320 --> 03:52:32.320]  in much of the mainstream Western press, though, are you?
[03:52:32.320 --> 03:52:34.320]  The boy was playing with a 12-year-old friend
[03:52:34.320 --> 03:52:36.320]  on a hill near the Polka metro station
[03:52:36.320 --> 03:52:38.320]  when the attack took place.
[03:52:38.320 --> 03:52:40.320]  The group of teenagers began making fun of the 11-year-old,
[03:52:40.320 --> 03:52:45.320]  laughing at him and making illusions to his foreign origin.
[03:52:45.320 --> 03:52:49.320]  So once again, multiculturalism is not working.
[03:52:49.320 --> 03:52:52.320]  This is monoculture. This is ghettoisation.
[03:52:52.320 --> 03:52:56.320]  They pushed the outsiders out for good.
[03:52:56.320 --> 03:52:59.320]  Okay, some of these individuals,
[03:52:59.320 --> 03:53:01.320]  some of these belief systems that we're inviting in
[03:53:01.320 --> 03:53:04.320]  are the most tribalistic, all the most racist,
[03:53:04.320 --> 03:53:06.320]  all the most bigoted, all the most intolerant
[03:53:06.320 --> 03:53:08.320]  you could ever imagine.
[03:53:08.320 --> 03:53:11.320]  So when they do create these ghettos in these migrant suburbs,
[03:53:11.320 --> 03:53:15.320]  the existing European white population are pushed out,
[03:53:15.320 --> 03:53:18.320]  often through violence and intimidation.
[03:53:18.320 --> 03:53:20.320]  It doesn't work.
[03:53:20.320 --> 03:53:25.320]  This is why we have no go zones spreading across Europe.
[03:53:25.320 --> 03:53:28.320]  Another story here out of Voice of Europe,
[03:53:28.320 --> 03:53:31.320]  a migrant says he accidentally raped a Belgian woman.
[03:53:31.320 --> 03:53:33.320]  He says, I wasn't myself that day.
[03:53:33.320 --> 03:53:35.320]  Just, you know, we've all been there, right?
[03:53:35.320 --> 03:53:37.320]  No, we haven't. We haven't.
[03:53:37.320 --> 03:53:39.320]  Oh, just accidentally raped a woman.
[03:53:39.320 --> 03:53:42.320]  It happens. Tafouik A.
[03:53:42.320 --> 03:53:44.320]  They don't even give you his surname.
[03:53:44.320 --> 03:53:46.320]  Rape a Belgian woman during a burglary
[03:53:46.320 --> 03:53:48.320]  in the Belgian town of Korjik.
[03:53:48.320 --> 03:53:51.320]  He was finally caught nearly five years later
[03:53:51.320 --> 03:53:54.320]  after an international DNA investigation,
[03:53:54.320 --> 03:53:57.320]  Belgian newspaper HLN reports.
[03:53:57.320 --> 03:54:00.320]  The North African migrant raped the woman in her apartment
[03:54:00.320 --> 03:54:02.320]  in Korjik's city centre.
[03:54:02.320 --> 03:54:05.320]  He put a knife to her throat and raped her on the kitchen table
[03:54:05.320 --> 03:54:07.320]  while her partner was working in their copy centre nearby.
[03:54:07.320 --> 03:54:10.320]  Remember last week in Sweden,
[03:54:10.320 --> 03:54:12.320]  we had the pro-refugee campaigner
[03:54:12.320 --> 03:54:15.320]  meets two Afghan refugees outside a bar
[03:54:15.320 --> 03:54:18.320]  because she couldn't find another man to go home with.
[03:54:18.320 --> 03:54:21.320]  Goes home with them back to their migrant centre.
[03:54:21.320 --> 03:54:23.320]  She's raped.
[03:54:23.320 --> 03:54:27.320]  Oh, but Macron says this is just not a new problem.
[03:54:27.320 --> 03:54:29.320]  This has been going on for decades.
[03:54:29.320 --> 03:54:30.320]  No, it hasn't.
[03:54:30.320 --> 03:54:32.320]  There's been an absolute explosion.
[03:54:32.320 --> 03:54:34.320]  You look at the polls.
[03:54:34.320 --> 03:54:36.320]  You look at the polls of women out of Sweden and Germany.
[03:54:36.320 --> 03:54:39.320]  They're now afraid to walk the streets at night
[03:54:39.320 --> 03:54:41.320]  because something has changed.
[03:54:41.320 --> 03:54:46.320]  Over the last few years, Macron, you lying cretin.
[03:54:46.320 --> 03:54:49.320]  Marine Le Pen's message to Trump.
[03:54:49.320 --> 03:54:51.320]  Macron is not a new political cycle.
[03:54:51.320 --> 03:54:53.320]  He's the end of the old one.
[03:54:53.320 --> 03:54:55.320]  This is what infuriates me about Macron.
[03:54:55.320 --> 03:54:58.320]  He's still trying to claim to be anti-establishment,
[03:54:58.320 --> 03:55:03.320]  anti-globalist, independent while following all their policies.
[03:55:03.320 --> 03:55:06.320]  While accusing Hungary and Poland of being authoritarian
[03:55:06.320 --> 03:55:10.320]  when it's the EU who's been consistently authoritarian
[03:55:10.320 --> 03:55:14.320]  for decades, literally ignoring votes and national referendums
[03:55:14.320 --> 03:55:18.320]  when countries try to reject their bureaucracy.
[03:55:18.320 --> 03:55:21.320]  There you see migrants charged with flash that headline
[03:55:21.320 --> 03:55:23.320]  back up out of Sweden.
[03:55:23.320 --> 03:55:26.320]  But again, Marine Le Pen's come out and said
[03:55:26.320 --> 03:55:28.320]  that Macron is a complete phony.
[03:55:28.320 --> 03:55:31.320]  He's trying to pose as being anti-establishment.
[03:55:31.320 --> 03:55:32.320]  He's not.
[03:55:32.320 --> 03:55:34.320]  He's doing all his buddy, buddy acts with Trump.
[03:55:34.320 --> 03:55:37.320]  If Trump falls for it, then there's going to be problems.
[03:55:37.320 --> 03:55:40.320]  There's going to be big problems because he's phony.
[03:55:40.320 --> 03:55:41.320]  He's a fraud.
[03:55:41.320 --> 03:55:43.320]  He's a facsimile of a populist.
[03:55:43.320 --> 03:55:45.320]  He's not a real populist.
[03:55:45.320 --> 03:55:47.320]  He's following globalist policies.
[03:55:47.320 --> 03:55:50.320]  Look at what he does, not what he says.
[03:55:50.320 --> 03:55:52.320]  And we see the consequences of these policies
[03:55:52.320 --> 03:55:54.320]  expanding out across Europe.
[03:55:54.320 --> 03:55:59.320]  Story out of France, which has got an 8.8% Muslim population
[03:55:59.320 --> 03:56:02.320]  just by coincidence the most terror attacks in Europe,
[03:56:02.320 --> 03:56:04.320]  just a coincidence.
[03:56:04.320 --> 03:56:08.320]  People injured in panic after a flare gun fired in southern France.
[03:56:08.320 --> 03:56:11.320]  Now, they continually tell us carry on as normal.
[03:56:11.320 --> 03:56:13.320]  We won't let the terrorists deter us.
[03:56:13.320 --> 03:56:16.320]  We won't let the terrorists change our way of life.
[03:56:16.320 --> 03:56:19.320]  Yeah, every time there's a loud noise in any major European city,
[03:56:19.320 --> 03:56:23.320]  people panic, people stampede, people flee.
[03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:25.320]  And it's happened once again.
[03:56:25.320 --> 03:56:28.320]  The crowd rushed out of bars in Nice fearing a terror attack.
[03:56:28.320 --> 03:56:32.320]  There's a person shot a harmless flare gun during a dispute.
[03:56:32.320 --> 03:56:33.320]  A dozen people were injured.
[03:56:33.320 --> 03:56:36.320]  Some had to turn to hospital treatment as people fled restaurants
[03:56:36.320 --> 03:56:38.320]  in panic fearing a terror attack after they reportedly
[03:56:38.320 --> 03:56:41.320]  heard several detonations.
[03:56:41.320 --> 03:56:45.320]  He literally had people there about a dozen people being trampled.
[03:56:45.320 --> 03:56:47.320]  Eyewitnesses thought they'd been shot dead.
[03:56:47.320 --> 03:56:50.320]  I mean, that is the level of panic we have right now
[03:56:50.320 --> 03:56:52.320]  in these major French cities.
[03:56:52.320 --> 03:56:56.320]  Remember about six months ago in London, Oxford Circus,
[03:56:56.320 --> 03:56:59.320]  there was some kind of argument on a train platform.
[03:56:59.320 --> 03:57:01.320]  There were no weapons were even fired.
[03:57:01.320 --> 03:57:04.320]  Massive stampede, massive panic,
[03:57:04.320 --> 03:57:07.320]  once again proving that we have let the terrorists
[03:57:07.320 --> 03:57:09.320]  change our way of life.
[03:57:09.320 --> 03:57:12.320]  The terrorists are winning because we're not facing up
[03:57:12.320 --> 03:57:15.320]  to the real problems, we're not addressing the root causes
[03:57:15.320 --> 03:57:17.320]  of why terrorism is increasing.
[03:57:17.320 --> 03:57:21.320]  So this whole carry on as normal mantra that we're being fed
[03:57:21.320 --> 03:57:25.320]  by the left, by the media isn't being born out in reality.
[03:57:25.320 --> 03:57:28.320]  People on carrying on as normal.
[03:57:28.320 --> 03:57:29.320]  And that's a problem.
[03:57:29.320 --> 03:57:31.320]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour
[03:57:31.320 --> 03:57:32.320]  of the Alex Jones show.
[03:57:32.320 --> 03:57:35.320]  War Room with Owen Shroyer is coming up next.

[03:58:49.320 --> 03:58:52.320]  just encouraging listeners to understand that
[03:58:52.320 --> 03:58:55.320]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
[03:58:55.320 --> 03:59:01.320]  or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com,

[03:59:04.320 --> 03:59:06.320]  You cannot say it any clearer.
[03:59:06.320 --> 03:59:09.320]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products
[03:59:09.320 --> 03:59:10.320]  at infowarstore.com.
[03:59:10.320 --> 03:59:12.320]  I want to thank everybody that has,
[03:59:12.320 --> 03:59:14.320]  but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste

[03:59:37.320 --> 03:59:39.320]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are.
