[00:00.000 --> 00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.640 --> 00:37.640]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:37.640 --> 00:43.480]  I tell you I have absolutely got to be focused today and get to all the news the
[00:43.480 --> 00:49.760]  science news the technology news the police state news it is all just over
[00:49.760 --> 00:57.020]  the top important we don't have any guest today ladies and gentlemen on this
[00:57.020 --> 01:02.040]  live friday edition so we will take a lot of your phone calls I'll try to go
[01:02.040 --> 01:05.920]  to them as quickly as possible obviously John Kerry has been subpoenaed
[01:05.920 --> 01:10.960]  finally on Benghazi gate with these new emails I even saw a clip this morning on
[01:10.960 --> 01:16.400]  CNN on YouTube from last night where they were talking about the same clip that
[01:16.400 --> 01:21.600]  I'd seen where the press secretary carney goes oh that part of the memo the
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.520]  email that says we need to all follow talking points that doesn't deal with
[01:26.520 --> 01:31.320]  Benghazi even though the memo deals with Benghazi and the host of CNN the
[01:31.320 --> 01:35.880]  reporter says that's like holding my hands up and saying these aren't my hands
[01:35.880 --> 01:43.200]  member Gibbs the former PR propagandists for Obama famously last year went on MS
[01:43.200 --> 01:47.040]  NBC and made a joke and he said look there's a drone program that's public
[01:47.040 --> 01:51.160]  killing people all over the world and we're told to tell the press it doesn't
[01:51.160 --> 01:59.200]  exist that's why saying the sun didn't come up this morning but separately even
[01:59.200 --> 02:03.240]  though one CNN host is telling the truth I've got a CNN article and it's got an
[02:03.240 --> 02:07.440]  accompanying video report here where they say is Benghazi important or is it a
[02:07.440 --> 02:12.480]  right-wing conspiracy theory and that follows the old Clinton memo to tell
[02:12.480 --> 02:17.200]  mainstream media in the early 90s anybody says were corrupt on cattle gate
[02:17.200 --> 02:23.920]  Vince Foster which was all true well all you do then is basically say they're
[02:23.920 --> 02:28.800]  conspiracy theorists so some reporters want to still have ratings and still not
[02:28.800 --> 02:34.680]  be a complete joke and no it's not gonna fly saying oh the Benghazi memo is not
[02:34.680 --> 02:41.160]  about Benghazi that's not gonna fly anywhere but other reporters are
[02:41.160 --> 02:45.880]  basically saying that so it's just like when we published two days ago the
[02:45.880 --> 02:50.160]  article that had links to the Justice Department saying that you know banks
[02:50.160 --> 02:55.600]  don't have gun shops or things as customers because that's a high risk you
[02:55.600 --> 03:00.680]  know thing outside of law it's a sanction on gun dealers and the gun
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.600]  industry they had their disinfo operatives running around like chickens
[03:05.600 --> 03:09.320]  with their heads cut off saying that it didn't exist by the way guys before I
[03:09.320 --> 03:12.760]  forget about it I heard 590 this morning covering it off the news I didn't have a
[03:12.760 --> 03:16.520]  chance to search engine it they've had some group that I would imagine is
[03:16.520 --> 03:20.200]  connected to Bloomberg saying we're coming out with biometric guns and the
[03:20.200 --> 03:25.920]  NRA's threatening us and doesn't want us to sell them what's wrong with biometric
[03:25.920 --> 03:29.440]  guns well the problem is you're gonna ban all our other guns and make us get
[03:29.440 --> 03:33.160]  biometric guns and the Attorney General admits they're debating and discussing
[03:33.160 --> 03:43.280]  an executive order to do that and even Senator Cornyn has come out two weeks
[03:43.280 --> 03:47.920]  ago and said the plan they're pushing and he warned the president not to do it
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.640]  as a silent executive order so another example of how they play the part of the
[03:51.640 --> 03:55.280]  victim look if you want to make a biometric gun and sell it that's your
[03:55.280 --> 04:00.320]  business the thing is none of us are gonna buy it and we know it's a trojan
[04:00.320 --> 04:05.000]  horse to go after our guns admittedly and so that's why people are so against
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.760]  biometric guns I'm not against a personal biometric safe that isn't wired into a
[04:09.760 --> 04:14.320]  smart meter with my biometrics I have biometric safes for long guns and hand
[04:14.320 --> 04:19.000]  guns because you just put your thumb on it boom one of them's an index finger and
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.680]  boom the drawer pops open and as long as you've got fresh batteries in it you
[04:23.680 --> 04:28.560]  can get to the gun instantly but my children can't so I'm not against
[04:28.560 --> 04:35.400]  technology I'm against the improper deployment of it but that's not even the
[04:35.400 --> 04:40.120]  big news I want to talk about payrolls in the US rise most is 2012
[04:40.120 --> 04:44.400]  unemployment they claim has dropped massively and if you believe that you
[04:44.400 --> 04:49.280]  believe in Santa Claus and that he rides a magic carpet pulled by Easter

[08:59.040 --> 09:05.320]  stacks here house GOP Obama withholding emails is criminal finally we're getting
[09:05.320 --> 09:11.480]  some of the proper statements that deal with reality finally we're escalating
[09:11.480 --> 09:16.640]  up to the level of the globalist top general says we didn't even try to save
[09:16.640 --> 09:20.120]  American lives in Benghazi that's because the plan was to kill those people
[09:20.120 --> 09:25.280]  there who had criticized giving missiles to al-qaeda which we later learned
[09:25.280 --> 09:36.120]  about continuing ladies and gentlemen they have now subpoenaed the Secretary
[09:36.120 --> 09:41.680]  of State John Kerry and I have those documents that we're gonna be going over
[09:41.680 --> 09:49.960]  dealing with that but the response of people like Jay Carney we're gonna play
[09:49.960 --> 09:54.880]  that clip coming up the White House press secretary is to say it is a right-wing
[09:54.880 --> 10:05.480]  conspiracy theory that basically Benghazi didn't even happen it's a subpoena
[10:05.480 --> 10:10.280]  Kerry to testify on Benghazi and Carney responds saying it's quote a conspiracy
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.200]  theory looking for a conspiracy theory no you got caught lying about the
[10:15.200 --> 10:21.000]  emails you got caught ordering stand down and it's all coming out here's the
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.480]  headline Carney on Benghazi is a conspiracy theory looking for a
[10:25.480 --> 10:29.120]  conspiracy theory you would have to ask the State Department about how they
[10:29.120 --> 10:35.960]  responded to FOIA request so they've been caught in their super Nixon moment
[10:35.960 --> 10:45.600]  already on Fast and Furious Salindra all the rest of the endless corruption and
[10:45.600 --> 10:50.080]  now they're caught red-handed on this I mean Obamacare is a giant criminal
[10:50.080 --> 10:54.960]  boondoggle but the Republican leadership comes out and says hey it's a done deal
[10:54.960 --> 10:59.760]  it's for good stop complaining 80% of you that don't like it including most
[10:59.760 --> 11:04.880]  Democrats you're going to accept it it's quote here to stay you will be
[11:04.880 --> 11:10.120]  assimilated it's over so that you just become helpless if something is upwards
[11:10.120 --> 11:15.960]  of 80% or more negative is a total ripoff all these big corporations are
[11:15.960 --> 11:20.680]  exempt it's designed to screw everybody death panels increasing prices
[11:20.680 --> 11:25.400]  lowering care on its face being challenged everywhere and they say it's
[11:25.400 --> 11:29.680]  here to stay nothing you can do about it remember Baghdad Bob that was his
[11:29.680 --> 11:35.000]  nickname the Iraqi Information Minister they ended up taking tapes of him and
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.720]  having best-selling DVDs sold online in 1993 I mean in 2003 I even bought one
[11:43.720 --> 11:47.760]  it's somewhere here around the office where there's planes flying behind him
[11:47.760 --> 11:52.640]  two miles behind him explosions the ground is shaking the American pigs have
[11:52.640 --> 12:01.080]  been defeated they have been driven out of Iraq completely missiles firing
[12:01.080 --> 12:07.400]  explosions behind him I mean this is this is wild this is the equivalent of
[12:07.400 --> 12:12.360]  walking in and your wife's got a guy on top of her in the bed no covers you see
[12:12.360 --> 12:18.680]  everything going on it's your neighbor he turns to you and says hey Bob hi I was
[12:18.680 --> 12:23.120]  over here checking your air conditioner for your wife and you say no Jim you're
[12:23.120 --> 12:27.240]  on top of her you are having sex with my wife and he gets off and he goes that's
[12:27.240 --> 12:31.400]  outrageous standing there naked in front of you no such thing has happened and
[12:31.400 --> 12:39.560]  this is just ridiculous and you say okay well what's that what's what why are
[12:39.560 --> 12:43.640]  your clothes off I mean it would be hilarious

[12:51.040 --> 12:55.520]  online Baghdad Bob I wanted to play some of him today for people that forget him
[12:55.520 --> 12:59.200]  he's wearing a black beret and he's wearing like a camo outfit and he's up

[13:29.920 --> 13:40.680]  the video library Baghdad Bob their allegations I think it's some kind of
[13:40.680 --> 13:49.200]  a cover to their failure this is a fact you can check it one second they are not
[13:49.200 --> 13:56.560]  in hold of any any Iraqi town or they are on the move as I have mentioned they
[13:56.560 --> 14:02.400]  are deceiving their soldiers and their officers that aggressing against Iraq and
[14:02.400 --> 14:07.840]  invading Iraq will be like a picnic is his last name Jay Carney is stupid lie
[14:07.840 --> 14:14.160]  they are telling their soldiers what they are facing it's a definite death
[14:14.160 --> 14:20.600]  they they are trapped everywhere in the country they are trapped in on cousin
[14:20.600 --> 14:26.200]  they are trapped near Basra they are trapped near Nasiriya they are trapped
[14:26.200 --> 14:33.440]  near Najaf they are everywhere because we will keep them on the move please turn
[14:33.440 --> 14:37.760]  off Jay Carney's father these aren't even the good clips a good job finding it in
[14:37.760 --> 14:42.880]  mere seconds gentlemen there are clips where he says they're nowhere in the
[14:42.880 --> 14:46.440]  country we've defeated them blowing them up while explosions are going off you
[14:46.440 --> 14:49.680]  ought to give this to the guys in the back for the nightly news tonight we
[14:49.680 --> 14:55.000]  ought to take clips of Baghdad Bob saying the Americans are nowhere they've been
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.520]  defeated and then cut into Obama saying you can keep your doctor and then cut
[14:59.520 --> 15:05.160]  into Jay Carney saying listen that memo that talks about Benghazi and talks
[15:05.160 --> 15:09.400]  about having talking points those talking points are not about Benghazi I
[15:09.400 --> 15:14.040]  mean that is the that is the same equivalent or or Obamacare here's
[15:14.040 --> 15:17.760]  another good one has cut the prices of your healthcare or is another good one
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.640]  there is no $5,000 fine per employee if you don't get your employees insurance
[15:22.640 --> 15:28.680]  in 2014 even though my accountant has us prepared our CPA one of the best in the
[15:28.680 --> 15:35.360]  city to pay the fines this year no the Americans are nowhere in Iraq they are
[15:35.360 --> 15:40.600]  they are defeat I mean this is like Hitler in the bunker is Berlin is
[15:40.600 --> 15:49.520]  burning saying that none of this exists okay we're we're good with Baghdad Bob
[15:49.520 --> 15:54.400]  for now guys thanks a lot that's that's good we do have Carney though now for
[15:54.400 --> 15:59.960]  everybody saying it is a conspiracy theory he is the new Baghdad Bob and
[15:59.960 --> 16:03.000]  again I saw a CNN clip this morning I've got to find it again it was on the
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.120]  front page of YouTube of one of the CNN anchors it's a blonde-haired guy forget
[16:07.120 --> 16:11.000]  his name going this is preposterous of course it's about Benghazi in the memo
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.720]  on Benghazi it's like saying my hands aren't my hands when I'm holding them up
[16:15.720 --> 16:21.880]  to you this is the level of lying but they're counting on you being so stupid
[16:21.880 --> 16:26.800]  that you just hear that Obamacare is free and you believe it so here is Jay
[16:26.800 --> 16:29.840]  Carney on the conspiracy theory you would have to ask the State Department about
[16:29.840 --> 16:35.080]  how they responded to FOIA requests I would again point you to the fact that I
[16:35.080 --> 16:40.480]  mean all you have to do is read it right top-line points goals that kind of stuff
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.280]  the only mention of Benghazi in the email is a question about what's your
[16:45.280 --> 16:50.260]  response to a story by the independent newspaper in the UK that says we have
[16:50.260 --> 16:53.640]  intelligence for we had intelligence was in advance of the attack that was
[16:53.640 --> 16:57.800]  ignored not aware of any actionable intelligence was the answer and then
[16:57.800 --> 17:04.600]  what does it do it cut and cuts and tastes the same line from the CIA talking
[17:04.600 --> 17:10.280]  points that again was what ambassador Rice used about Benghazi why turn over in
[17:10.280 --> 17:15.080]  a Benghazi suit it seems you would have to ask State Department about their
[17:15.080 --> 17:23.040]  process for responding to FOIA requests again you can just read it and then
[17:23.040 --> 17:26.480]  decide for yourself as many people have now said and written like this is a
[17:26.480 --> 17:30.840]  conspiracy and theory and spiritual conspiracy comes in and says we want
[17:30.840 --> 17:34.360]  Benghazi documents the administration says this is not a Benghazi document
[17:34.360 --> 17:37.640]  we're not turning it over again I don't like this is a State Department FOIA
[17:37.640 --> 17:43.360]  request that's respond so it's a bogus conspiracy theory from the GOP where'd
[17:43.360 --> 17:47.880]  you get these droids these aren't the droids you're looking for you can move

[24:23.680 --> 24:27.360]  I want to ask the listeners a question we know Bill Clinton isn't even the top
[24:27.360 --> 24:32.480]  10 now of most ridiculous liars Jay Carney and Obama are right up there at
[24:32.480 --> 24:39.880]  the top but here's the question do they deserve the Baghdad Bob award for 2014
[24:39.880 --> 24:46.720]  because Kim Jong-un they claim he makes the birds tweet and the sunshine and is
[24:46.720 --> 24:54.120]  actually like a heavenly creature so North Korea this is a global contest so
[24:54.120 --> 25:01.400]  I don't think Obama and Jay Carney have reached the level of Kim Jong-un yet but
[25:01.400 --> 25:06.920]  they're getting close they are getting close so I'm gonna open the phones up
[25:06.920 --> 25:10.520]  and I want to ask all of you where do you think the Benghazi investigation is
[25:10.520 --> 25:13.920]  going what do things gonna happen during the subpoena of Kerry will he try to
[25:13.920 --> 25:18.040]  refuse the subpoena is this the end of Obama because we know it was really a
[25:18.040 --> 25:21.800]  hit of ambassador Stevens who confirmed that with inside whistleblowers like
[25:21.800 --> 25:27.840]  Tosh Plumlee and other Intel sources like Colonel Schaefer and others who
[25:27.840 --> 25:31.240]  says he believes it was a hit when I said the government was killing him and
[25:31.240 --> 25:34.600]  then kind of backtracked and said well I said it was a hit we just don't know who
[25:34.600 --> 25:39.640]  well the Al Qaeda security force was hired to run security by the State
[25:39.640 --> 25:43.840]  Department the Pentagon in Benghazi which had been used that year as the base
[25:43.840 --> 25:48.920]  of operations the topple Muammar Gaddafi now they're using Libya as a base of
[25:48.920 --> 25:52.560]  operations to attack all of Africa basically or the central and northern
[25:52.560 --> 25:58.520]  areas and then the Pentagon's moving in with African to counter their own forces
[25:58.520 --> 26:02.880]  that were deployed again they don't run them they just bring them in give them
[26:02.880 --> 26:09.320]  weapons like a bunch of minions evil minions and despicable me they run
[26:09.320 --> 26:14.040]  around blowing stuff up missling shooting flamethrowing raping murdering and
[26:14.040 --> 26:18.920]  then later the West has an excuse to come in and take over an area and those
[26:18.920 --> 26:25.120]  guys load on C-130s and are flown out by the Pentagon and NATO to the next base
[26:25.120 --> 26:32.600]  of operations and if you don't believe me look up quote the airlift of evil the
[26:32.600 --> 26:39.640]  times of London where 40,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda commanders including generals
[26:39.640 --> 26:43.640]  were flown out the month after the invasion of Afghanistan paid in gold
[26:43.640 --> 26:49.520]  bars on C-130s to Pakistan to start the next operation of destabilization
[26:49.520 --> 26:54.400]  there's NBC reporting on it the airlift of evil why do we let Pakistan pull
[26:54.400 --> 27:01.680]  volunteers out of Kunduz let them November 29th 2001 one month after the
[27:01.680 --> 27:06.400]  invasion September October November about month and a half after see my
[27:06.400 --> 27:10.320]  memory you don't fail the guys just search engine what I said this isn't
[27:10.320 --> 27:15.280]  preplanned and it was there as I said it was 98% of the time my brain is still
[27:15.280 --> 27:21.360]  accurate sometimes I get stuff wrong and you catch it let us know we we correct
[27:21.360 --> 27:28.280]  it but back then I'd go look NBC times of London they had special forces
[27:28.280 --> 27:32.440]  Colonel went public to break it to the San Francisco Chronicle and said look we
[27:32.440 --> 27:39.480]  were loading them on C-130s with gold and these were the people that that were
[27:39.480 --> 27:44.120]  supposedly in the war but the truth is we were just supposed to shell conscripts
[27:44.120 --> 27:49.480]  in front of the cities in in ditches and it was all for show yeah they took 14
[27:49.480 --> 27:53.560]  year olds on average stuck them in ditches our military would bomb them and
[27:53.560 --> 27:58.600]  kill them and then the al Qaeda would stay in the cities and wait for the C-130s
[27:58.600 --> 28:03.840]  to land after the country surrendered quote load them on the aircraft fly them
[28:03.840 --> 28:07.360]  out to start the next trouble well now that's been done everywhere else but
[28:07.360 --> 28:14.760]  finally it's so public and the military special forces and contractors even the
[28:14.760 --> 28:18.360]  guys that are pretty immoral that have been selected because they were willing
[28:18.360 --> 28:22.440]  to ship drugs in and you know it's one thing to ship drugs into the US so you
[28:22.440 --> 28:26.400]  can get an extra hundred thousand a year or whatever you know for your girlfriend
[28:26.400 --> 28:32.560]  it's another thing to give heat-seeking missiles to al Qaeda when al Qaeda is
[28:32.560 --> 28:38.400]  laughing at you saying you're a wimp and they're going to kill you I liked
[28:38.400 --> 28:48.000]  killing you army and Marines in Iraq and we will kill you next that's come out
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.160]  they do that and I've talked to the people who've actually been there and
[28:51.160 --> 28:55.920]  witnessed it and you've heard Tosh Plumlee talk about it too imagine you've
[28:55.920 --> 29:00.280]  got to go training of weapons the guys that literally feel so guilty that
[29:00.280 --> 29:04.600]  they're even associating with you themselves that they tell you I'm
[29:04.600 --> 29:12.640]  going to kill you when I get a chance that's how dumb the globalist think you

[35:27.040 --> 35:32.920]  dangerous to not like the government 80% or more don't like Obamacare and the
[35:32.920 --> 35:40.040]  numbers are growing every day but you are a kook and a racist and a bigot and a
[35:40.040 --> 35:48.600]  conspiracy theorist and a nutball because you don't like it this Benghazi
[35:48.600 --> 35:54.040]  memo has nothing to do with Benghazi it's a conspiracy theory and even the
[35:54.040 --> 35:59.600]  mainline corporate horror media is going excuse me even saying it's going
[35:59.600 --> 36:05.640]  excuse me like this is a conspiracy in theory and spurs of a conspiracy comes
[36:05.640 --> 36:09.200]  in and says we want Benghazi documents the administration says this is not a
[36:09.200 --> 36:12.440]  Benghazi documents we're not turning it over again I don't like this is a state
[36:12.440 --> 36:20.000]  department for your request I mean that is really a hard deal to put up with and
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.640]  face but if you go back to Bill Clinton memo in the early 90s that the Western
[36:25.640 --> 36:29.900]  Journalism Center got that's public from the library admitted that we spent three
[36:29.900 --> 36:34.480]  shows on the last two weeks is it so important it says when they counter us
[36:34.480 --> 36:38.920]  on cattle futures when they counter us on Vince Foster when they counter us on
[36:38.920 --> 36:44.080]  sex scandals when anybody breaks any of this whether it's a mainstream news
[36:44.080 --> 36:51.280]  article or a new media article we call it a conspiracy theory and say they're
[36:51.280 --> 36:56.480]  trying to make money well of course we're trying to make money just like any
[36:56.480 --> 37:01.880]  other media operation we are in the type of media we're in because it's our
[37:01.880 --> 37:05.720]  passion and we believe in the Second Amendment family values property rights
[37:05.720 --> 37:10.360]  national sovereignty a court system that isn't corrupt a police force that
[37:10.360 --> 37:14.640]  isn't corrupt a military that isn't part of an empire and then we need to make
[37:14.640 --> 37:21.160]  money to then build our media organization pay our journalists pay our
[37:21.160 --> 37:27.080]  reporters pay our camera crews pay our researchers pay our accountants pay our
[37:27.080 --> 37:34.360]  lawyers pay our secretaries and then yeah of course we like driving a car that
[37:34.360 --> 37:38.320]  doesn't break down of course we like taking the kids on a vacation and buying
[37:38.320 --> 37:43.240]  the business some nice dresses but that isn't our God if that was our God we
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.560]  would have sold out to you to be paid ten times more but they try to make it
[37:47.560 --> 37:51.680]  about they can make money they can have media organizations they can have Air
[37:51.680 --> 37:56.120]  Force One and red carpets and two million dollars a night in hotels from
[37:56.120 --> 38:06.360]  for mrs. Obama or mrs. Clinton but oh my gosh heaven forbid that there be any
[38:06.360 --> 38:10.600]  libertarian or conservative groups that are tax exempt promoting pro-life or
[38:10.600 --> 38:15.440]  something we've got to shut that down why you just can't have anything heaven
[38:15.440 --> 38:23.120]  forbid that Africans ever ever ever ever have air conditioning or a car
[38:23.120 --> 38:29.440]  Obama told them that's bad you got to stay poor slaves not industrialized and
[38:29.440 --> 38:33.880]  walk around in bare feet mining diamonds for De Beers and Oppenheimers
[38:33.880 --> 38:38.000]  where they literally each person brings out hundreds of carrots a day
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.480]  sometimes and then gets nothing and lives in an open tent almost starving to
[38:42.480 --> 38:48.560]  death with guys with machine guns over them so that men can go use a year's
[38:48.560 --> 38:52.920]  salary to buy their girlfriend a four-carat diamond ring or she'll throw
[38:52.920 --> 38:57.240]  a fit if he doesn't all the diamonds are blood diamonds all the diamonds are
[38:57.240 --> 39:05.520]  evil diamonds Johnny to play a clip of Obama saying Africans can't have air
[39:05.520 --> 39:11.400]  conditioning or car that's what they're teaching all the trendies in Austin
[39:11.400 --> 39:16.840]  you're gonna live in a 200 square foot thing with your family and then those of
[39:16.840 --> 39:20.120]  us that run the scam you know we're gonna live in big mansions in the
[39:20.120 --> 39:23.080]  countryside and we're gonna be exempt because our mansions are an
[39:23.080 --> 39:27.480]  environmental easement that the former mayor now a state senator grabbed and
[39:27.480 --> 39:34.920]  owns himself and runs through a bank his name's Kirk Watson and the same scams
[39:34.920 --> 39:40.120]  run everywhere these people have 10 15 20 bedroom houses huge rivers huge lakes
[39:40.120 --> 39:48.440]  skeet shooting zip lines you know 5,000 yards line over cliffs just
[39:48.440 --> 39:53.440]  helicopter pads and it's all rancher property they took and then they sit on
[39:53.440 --> 39:58.160]  it and environmental easements tax exempt and don't pay property tax that's
[39:58.160 --> 40:06.960]  just the local fake and viral crooks the Rockefellers look it up the first
[40:06.960 --> 40:12.080]  national park the first two national parks on the east coast there's PBS
[40:12.080 --> 40:19.120]  documentary about it were their ancestral homes and 10 20,000 acre homesteads
[40:19.120 --> 40:24.640]  with I'm talking thousands of acres like golf courses folks you think the
[40:24.640 --> 40:27.880]  French have big gardens the French emperors the French Kings have those
[40:27.880 --> 40:32.280]  big gardens that were all manicured the Rockefellers I saw it on television have
[40:32.280 --> 40:37.240]  one that went on for thousands of acres with all these sculptures and it was the
[40:37.240 --> 40:43.680]  first national park but it's private for them and it's all tax exempt the
[40:43.680 --> 40:52.400]  helicopters the palaces they all control it it's theirs yeah they just pulled up
[40:52.400 --> 40:56.840]  the Rockefeller national parks and then there's little corridors where you were
[40:56.840 --> 41:02.080]  the citizens can drive that are fenced off and then you can see some of it all
[41:02.080 --> 41:10.400]  tax-exempt everything Warren Buffett tax exempt all of them tax-exempt I'm
[41:10.400 --> 41:13.680]  ever growing up in Dallas my dad knew a lot of rich people really rich people
[41:13.680 --> 41:18.640]  and that was all the big joke I mean there's a lot of famous quotes it was
[41:18.640 --> 41:23.480]  some famous billionaire woman I remember in the 80s and she said she said taxes
[41:23.480 --> 41:28.120]  rich rich people don't pay taxes because that's the big joke growing up my dad
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.080]  would explain that the little guy and the nouveau rich that's French for new rich
[41:32.080 --> 41:36.560]  they pay the taxes a guy making ten million dollars a year that employs
[41:36.560 --> 41:43.120]  5,000 people he pays taxes she pays taxes when you get into the elite club
[41:43.120 --> 41:49.400]  you don't pay taxes anymore how big of a hoax is that you get your sports stadiums
[41:49.400 --> 41:53.840]  paid for I've already been on this rant all week I apologize we're gonna go to
[41:53.840 --> 41:59.240]  your phone calls yeah that was a that was Leona Helmsley great job guys
[41:59.240 --> 42:06.160]  fine that's right she says we don't pay taxes only little people pay taxes she
[42:06.160 --> 42:11.040]  was 19 22,007 was an American business woman she was known for her flamboyant
[42:11.040 --> 42:15.080]  personality and had a reputation for tyrannical behavior that earned her the
[42:15.080 --> 42:21.600]  nickname the Queen of Mean she was promoted by Bieber Silverman group and
[42:21.600 --> 42:27.080]  its co-owner Joyce Bieber who persuaded her to call herself Queen of the Palace
[42:27.080 --> 42:31.880]  Hotel following allegations by unpaid contractors that work done on her home
[42:31.880 --> 42:36.280]  had been charged to her company she was investigated and convicted of federal
[42:36.280 --> 42:40.400]  income tax evasion another crime she was low-level although having initially
[42:40.400 --> 42:44.680]  received a sentence of 16 years Helmsley was required only served 19 months in
[42:44.680 --> 42:48.560]  prison and two months under house arrest during the trial a former housekeeper
[42:48.560 --> 42:53.520]  testified that she had heard Helmsley say we don't pay taxes only little people
[42:53.520 --> 42:58.080]  pay taxes and saying that became notorious and was identified with her
[42:58.080 --> 43:03.800]  for the rest of her life that was her because she worked for rich people she
[43:03.800 --> 43:07.280]  was just nouveau rich but worked for the elite kind of like work for a made-off
[43:07.280 --> 43:12.120]  type group that was her shooting her mouth off but they burned her because
[43:12.120 --> 43:18.440]  she was such a big mouth the the entire ruling socialist party this came out
[43:18.440 --> 43:24.520]  last year in France pays zero taxes federally the EU bureaucrats passed the
[43:24.520 --> 43:28.840]  law a decade ago they pay zero taxes federally in the EU tax everybody else
[43:28.840 --> 43:33.000]  does and when they found all their Swiss bank accounts because they were taking
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.520]  everybody else's Swiss bank accounts that was after tax money there was a big
[43:37.520 --> 43:44.520]  scandal and no one got in trouble they raised a 101% tax look it up just type
[43:44.520 --> 43:52.280]  in France has 101% tax on people making over a million euros a year that sounds
[43:52.280 --> 43:55.440]  like a lot folks but when you pay taxes and make say a million that's about a
[43:55.440 --> 44:00.920]  million dollars you pay in France 78% federal you had everything else in it
[44:00.920 --> 44:05.640]  French making a million euros a year literally can't even live in a nice
[44:05.640 --> 44:13.640]  house taxes on some wealthy French top 100% of income Reuters actually it was
[44:13.640 --> 44:19.760]  over that if you look at Forbes they did the analysis it was 101% of course they
[44:19.760 --> 44:26.160]  were exempt they were exempt and they're exempt from all of it if you're part of
[44:26.160 --> 44:31.440]  one of the inside parties you just get left alone and then you get big
[44:31.440 --> 44:35.280]  government checks from the middle class then you get to live in a house for free
[44:35.280 --> 44:38.720]  and then get welfare money or a government job and get to go around
[44:38.720 --> 44:44.280]  bossing everybody around and so the French middle class is stopping working
[44:44.280 --> 44:49.120]  I know people that live in France Brits and Americans and they say the French
[44:49.120 --> 44:56.240]  more and more will not work why should they yeah there's Forbes French tax
[44:56.240 --> 45:01.680]  soars over 100% I said I'd go to your phone calls who is the greatest bs sir
[45:01.680 --> 45:06.600]  of the modern age is it Baghdad Bob saying Iraq was never invaded in 2003

[56:43.440 --> 56:47.400]  don't know he would lie about stuff he would lie about stuff that couldn't be
[56:47.400 --> 56:51.640]  proven one way or another sharing there's no drone program when it's public
[56:51.640 --> 56:56.040]  that's that's bigger well it goes all the way back when he was running for
[56:56.040 --> 57:01.760]  president when he said yeah I tried marijuana but I didn't inhale yeah yeah
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.520]  with this guy just whatever reality is it's his pigment of imagination it has
[57:06.520 --> 57:13.240]  no bearing in truth no you're right you're right all right good points thank
[57:13.240 --> 57:17.480]  you for making that all right that's one vote for Bill Clinton that is one for

[57:32.320 --> 57:36.360]  greatest baloney master has to be our president because everything that comes
[57:36.360 --> 57:41.360]  out of his mouth is actually a lie his nose must be two feet long you know look
[57:41.360 --> 57:44.840]  at all the drugs they're shipping in and then they talk about when you never
[57:44.840 --> 57:49.560]  hear Obama talking about drug abuse or the war on drugs so he's how can you
[57:49.560 --> 57:52.680]  get the right amount of press to make him look better and it's just it's
[57:52.680 --> 57:56.200]  crazy how he's on all these talk shows he's supposed to be the president of
[57:56.200 --> 57:59.920]  the United States he's supposed to be a constitutional scholar and all the guys
[57:59.920 --> 58:04.880]  done is lie lie lie don't you agree with me yes but you know a lot of times they
[58:04.880 --> 58:08.640]  hire doctors to be hit men because they're so good at killing people because
[58:08.640 --> 58:11.840]  they know how the body works that's why they hired Obama a constitutional
[58:11.840 --> 58:16.320]  scholar he knows how to kill America that makes sense yes well he's really
[58:16.320 --> 58:19.520]  into his drone program of course you never hear anything on the news you

[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.800]  all right we started the second hour they've subpoenaed Lord Kerry on Benghazi
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.840]  we've got a bunch of Ukraine stories with more helicopters being shot down we've
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.960]  got a lot of important economic news and in your phone calls but we really need
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.840]  to just talk about the level of lies and deceit with Gibbs saying that they were
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.080]  told to say there was no drone program when it was a public program now
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:00.160]  saying the Benghazi memo that they lied about is not a Benghazi memo so going to
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.800]  the zoo and there's an elephant saying to your five-year-old that's not an
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.920]  elephant that's actually Santa Claus I mean it's really getting weird it's
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.560]  Baghdad Bob level where he's standing there with the bombs going off behind
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.360]  him in Iraq as the Iraqi information minister saying the Americans have been
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:23.320]  driven from the country they are weak they are driven from country we defeat
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.560]  them in like two miles away a huge mushroom cloud bomb goes off 2,000 pound
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.800]  bomb again I was against the Iraq war but I'm just saying that guy was a piece
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:38.800]  of work that guy was a huge piece of work and that's the level of this how
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.040]  do they get away with it we're taking your phone calls Shane in North
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:47.920]  Carolina you're on the air welcome Alex let me be clear if you like the radio
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.760]  station you can keep it but you are a racist radical extremist Hillary what's
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:58.080]  your opinion what difference does it make they're all radical extremists I'll
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:04.720]  tell you what we know and expect certain politicians to be the biggest DS or so
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.640]  I want to address the ones that in my opinion are the most dangerous to the
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.240]  patriot movement and that is and you know I know you don't like that quote unquote
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.400]  insight but I don't think it's infighting to talk about shields like gun
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.080]  back that's just my opinion but you know he came out early on look at how he
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:26.560]  sabotage the Ron Paul movement at a critical time in 07 you know this money
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.440]  bombs terrorists and I don't know about you but Ron Paul have been here's the
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.120]  quote I don't know about you but Ron Paul scary he calls us moving a money bomb
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:40.160]  blowing things up the army needs to be used against them close quote well
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.080]  that's just the beginning you think about all the things that he said over the
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:47.120]  years and in my opinion he's sort of like a sleeper spell for the elite because
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.960]  you know for one I think that when he's quote unquote got fired from Fox I don't
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.680]  I mean I honestly think that was part of the I don't know they really hated him
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.920]  up there I don't know listen here's the deal here's the deal I don't infight and
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.920]  it's a classy thing I do he said that I was basically wanting violent overthrow
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.720]  the government and then I was covering up for Bundy's racism pure bull and so I
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.840]  had to come out against it to protect my operation that said a few days ago I had
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.040]  multiple affiliates here at one of my friends heard it I haven't gone to listen
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.600]  but he said all right we all need to work together that guy's not that bad you
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.760]  know he's kind of like Malcolm X though and I'm like Martin Luther King we just
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.640]  don't need violence but let's stop the infighting so he got a lot of heat doing
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.040]  that he obviously got spanked I don't want to be enemies with Glenn Beck I
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:39.760]  don't it makes me feel bad to attack him I'm not jealous of him I wish him
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:43.640]  long days pleasant nights I actually like a lot of the stuff he's done a lot
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.840]  people don't like his style I think he's really a smart guy I mean he went on
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.160]  air and said they're gonna blow stuff up and blame the Liberty Movement on Fox I
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:56.160]  don't want him to be Benedict Arnold but I agree that at key points I think he's
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:02.360]  thinks he's covering his butt and that he is throwing people under the bus at
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:07.760]  critical times to do that and listen we're going to lose everything if people
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.320]  that love Liberty the Constitution the Bill of Rights call us right wing call
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:18.400]  us classical liberals call us constitutionalist libertarians we
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.720]  believe in America okay and I don't want to be enemies with him he does a lot of
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.920]  good work okay yeah hey listen I have one more thing if you don't mind actually
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.720]  sure and that is an idea that I think pretty good if he kind of a fun that's
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.600]  higher what is it for work through to do and that is to take like basically
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.240]  old-school history situations like you know say Rosa Parks or you know
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.480]  classical things in our history like Martin Luther King yeah yeah you know
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:50.000]  random things like that and and basically say if CNN and MSNBC was around
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.520]  back then how they would cover it you know they'd be calling like Rosa Parks
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.720]  terrorist and like that's a great idea they would be no that's a great effect
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:02.320]  I made that point that's a great idea right back the globalists have controlled
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.400]  the mainstream media for a long time but now they're expanding making the
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.560]  weaponization even more vicious and deceptive all the major networks are
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:15.240]  state-run we are partnering this year with the NFL the NFL has become a
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:19.760]  political weapon against the Second Amendment pushes Obamacare MSNBC tells
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:23.040]  us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our kind of
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.080]  private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.320]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more important than
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.120]  ever to realize that we are not the alternative media we are the true media
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.800]  the establishment dinosaur press is dying we are in an information war and

[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:38.320]  from Austin Texas Alex Jones well the White House lied and said that there
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:45.080]  were no emails on Benghazi in the first day we have the memo on Benghazi out for
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:49.000]  two days that clearly shows they were involved in talking points in a cover
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.520]  up we know there was a stand down you know weapons are being transferred to
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:02.280]  al-Qaeda now the Congress congressman is his committee is subpoenaing the
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:10.280]  Secretary of State John Kerry will he refuse the subpoena like Eric Holder
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.400]  has done will he refuse the documents this holder will come testified but he
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.840]  won't give the documents up and so no one should even be at those hearings
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:23.000]  has been pointed out he should be in jail as multiple members of Congress from
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.360]  Texas have pointed out now Boehner's eyeing a special committee on Benghazi
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.960]  that'll be a whitewash with us especially appointed House and Senate
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:38.200]  members that will you know act like they're investigating but but covered
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.240]  it up just like Boehner is propping up obama care with claiming oh we'll tweak
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:48.680]  a couple pieces of it tweak 13,000 writer pages on a multi-thousand page
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:57.520]  total bill how do you tweak a sword chopping America's head off a meat
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.920]  cleaver coming down on us written to shut down the country I'm gonna go to
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.760]  your phone calls if you just joined us we're asking phone callers we're asking
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:12.800]  listeners who is the greatest liar who is the greatest BS sir do we have the
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.160]  clip what's the congressman's name from Georgia that thinks islands float and
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:21.200]  that if you build too much on they flip over is it Hank Johnson I think he's
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:26.200]  disqualified because I think he's such an airhead that he actually believes that
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:35.600]  that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:45.800]  and and capsize we don't anticipate that the the Guam population I think
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:50.680]  currently about 175,000 and again with 8,000 Marines and their families it's an
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:11:01.240]  addition of about 25,000 more into the population or is it Carney or is it the
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:06.680]  Carney that says the Benghazi memo that says it's about Benghazi that they
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:14.120]  lied about the judicial watch Scott they're now saying that isn't about
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:19.800]  Benghazi like this is a conspiracy and theory and spiritual conspiracy comes in
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.200]  and says we want Benghazi documents the administration says this is not a
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.440]  Benghazi documents we're not turning it over again I don't like this is a state
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:34.840]  department for your request the response or is it Robert Gibbs the last
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:40.880]  propagandist before Carney saying that there is no drone program when he
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.600]  admits there was a public drone program it's public it's like saying that the
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.200]  New York Yankees don't exist or it's like saying that Warren Buffett doesn't
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.200]  exist or it's like saying Angela Merkel doesn't exist of Germany or it's like
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.200]  saying Hillary Clinton doesn't exist or it's like saying George Washington
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:02.360]  didn't exist or it's like saying the Dallas Cowboys don't exist anyone with
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.040]  a brain above room temperature knows these things exist the effect there's the
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:14.160]  Gibbs quote Robert Gibbs I was told not even to acknowledge the drone program so
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.560]  you go to the congressman Jesse Ventura didn't said yeah you wrote that bill to
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.280]  build FEMA camps that have already been constructed but expand them the
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.680]  emergency centers establishment act and the Tennessee congressman goes in this
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:36.720]  fake kind of Nellie Nellie person meets Foghorn leghorn he goes do you believe
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.000]  space aliens are gonna come down out of the sky governor and eat children on the
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.800]  ground there is no such a bill that he cosponsored and wrote and Ventura goes
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.000]  really and he goes well I have the bill right here here's the number and he goes
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:00.800]  oh I declare that bill and then just literally like what's the name of the
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:08.920]  lady in the gala the wind scarlet literally talks like scarlet puts his
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:14.880]  hand in his mouth and goes oh my goodness I did not know that you meant
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:21.200]  that bill we have to end this conversation right now I'm not going to
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:27.640]  discuss that bill I mean we got congressman saying islands are floating
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:31.280]  we got congressman saying aliens are gonna eat children if you bring up a
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.440]  bill they wrote we I mean these people are a bunch of freaks when I went through
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:39.840]  the process of becoming press secretary one of the things one of the first
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.880]  things they told me was you're not even to acknowledge the drone program you're
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:49.320]  not even to discuss that it exists and so I would get a question like that and
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.120]  literally I couldn't tell you what major asked because once I figured out it was
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.360]  about the drone program I realized I'm not supposed to talk about it and but
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.720]  here's what's inherently crazy about that he goes on here's what's inherently
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.200]  crazy about that proposition on reporting of a program that exists there
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:10.160]  you go right yeah back it up 20 seconds back if I want him to hear that he goes
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:16.880]  this is based on a program that's public and known to exist position you're being
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:23.680]  asked a question based on reporting of a program that exists right so you're the
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:28.120]  official government spokesperson acting as if the entire program pay no
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.840]  attention to the man behind the curtain right and then there's another clip that
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.880]  I haven't found yet it was on the front page of YouTube this morning but they
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:40.040]  customize it for your searches so it's a bunch of news clips on there and race
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:43.040]  cars that's what I was looking at those two I was watching some race car stuff
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:48.120]  anyways last night the kids went to bed so in between the race car stuff and
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.160]  news clips on the front of my YouTube homepage it was a clip of CNN and the
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:15:00.320]  headline was something like CNN reporter talks about Carney and Benghazi
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.600]  memo and and the reporters has the same thing he was there denying reality like
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:10.360]  saying our hands don't exist and laughing about it but it's not funny because
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:14.680]  they're getting away with it this will be like if the cops pulls you over and
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.240]  you can hardly talk you're slurring your words there's a bottle of Jack Daniels
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:24.520]  open in the driver's seat a beer open and you're hiccuping and there's 12 packs of
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.920]  beer in the back with with with two people passed out drunk who vomited on
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.440]  each other okay and the cop pulls you over and says you're weaving you go
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:40.880]  all over a lot been drinking okay and then you just open the door and go I love
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:50.120]  you officer and start trying to hug them I mean this is beyond that this is
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:58.720]  beyond that this is how they talk to us this is how government treats us the
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:03.440]  prototype attack at Benghazi was rooted in a protest over the video I know
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.920]  that you and I are both in a different time zone right now but we're still in
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:13.840]  April of 2014 and this is a discussion about what she said and what turned out
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:21.280]  to be the case that we have had dozens of times in this room you heard that it's
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.480]  a conspiracy theory now I think Baghdad Bob I'm not trying to prejudice folks I
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.080]  think Baghdad Bob saying the US forces weren't even in Iraq when they were in
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:35.680]  Baghdad I think he he's who I'm voting for I get one vote for Baghdad Bob we
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.400]  got one vote for Bill Clinton one vote for Obama one vote for Baghdad Bob that's
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.840]  my one vote who do you think the greatest bsr of the last 20 years is we're
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:49.360]  talking right now about giving awards out the Baghdad Bob award will be given
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:53.840]  today the first annual we'll do it on May 2nd every day after May Day

[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:19.200]  listening to you for a long time so Satan is the winner I feel like we're
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.560]  getting close to Alex and I know Scotland says five ten years Russia
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:27.160]  China already I disagree with that and I want to know what does your spirit tell
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:35.080]  you how close you really think we are to a flashpoint event occurring I don't
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.680]  know but everything's accelerating everything's getting crazier we're
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:43.240]  looking at a world that could be on fire very very quickly tell me who do you
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.360]  think because it's a question who do you think though temporarily a human on this
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:51.080]  earth who deserves it shouldn't be the Baghdad Bob award it should be the
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:58.880]  Satan is a liar award who gets satanic level lying award well I gave you my
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:03.560]  answer the author of lies he's it I know but I told you the devil is is not a

[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.480]  liar I would have to say President Obama just because when he ran on this
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:56.520]  election he made it seem like you are all going to be delivered with hope and
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.960]  it was going to be a great thing for him winning and it's just been lies and
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:08.040]  deceit to be understatement so Obama for sure so Obama gets the most outrageous
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:12.720]  liar award yes yes for sure I mean you don't believe him you don't believe him
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:17.080]  that when you go work and get your paycheck you didn't build that oh no
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:22.120]  I'm sitting here I work now so I'm very sure I'm working for it it's just oh you
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.240]  mean that's a good point you mean when you lift weights for two aerobics you
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:30.200]  didn't build your muscles oh well you know let Obama tell it maybe that's
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.960]  true you know and I think I think you're a conspiracy theorist and aren't allowed
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:37.200]  to have a view that you have your job and get your paycheck or run your
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:42.040]  business or that you work out and get that great figure get rid of that
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:47.040]  I'm sorry go ahead and you know I'm a typical American citizen and it's just
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.840]  bad that we're all fully aware and then it's just like we're feeding lies when
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:55.120]  we tell the truth so it's just like the truth has been told to be alive and now

[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:21.840]  air thanks for holding hi hi doing Alex pretty good my friend what's on your
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:29.280]  mind I think the biggest bs there is Obama with this affiliation with the
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:36.120]  New World Order because they just keep constantly telling you lies trying to
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:42.080]  think that Americans are so stupid well they put the police in black uniforms
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:44.680]  and armored vehicles are delivered and surveillance systems are put up yeah
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:48.720]  we're in trouble they're only stalling us till they blow stuff up and blame it
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:53.160]  on us and say we're all terrorists I mean you know that right yes I do I
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:59.280]  actually I served a tour in the United States Navy when I got out of high school
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.440]  back in 2000 well thank you for your service part of this they were screened
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:09.320]  our I Dustin Kramer support and defend the Constitution of the United States of
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:14.960]  America against freedom and to defend it to freedom and democracy around the
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:21.240]  world whatever but it can solve foreign and domestic enemies and I think Obama
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:28.560]  is a domestic enemy with no good for the United States so would that be enough
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:33.280]  to support maybe like a movement oh listen I mean we've got to impeach them
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:38.160]  now but what's cut and dry is fast and furious they're caught red-handed
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:45.080]  cylinder red-handed and they're caught red-handed my friend brother on this
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.640]  telling banks not to let gun dealers or gun shops have accounts or cancel them
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.840]  that's on record they did that that's torturous interference it's racketeering
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:27:01.000]  it's a civil rights violation it is pure mafia and they should be indicted
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.120]  right now but that's not gonna happen we impeachment right now but Congress is
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:09.240]  blackmailed and scared but as more people turn against the system it can
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.680]  happen and it won't fix things if we end up indicting Obama or he has to step
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.960]  down but it'll scare government for a while and we'll see reforms like we saw
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.800]  in the 70s you got them in these people are getting away with everything right
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:25.640]  now and if they get away with all this I appreciate your call but they get away
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:30.840]  with this the sky's the limit I mean there's not much further to go folks they
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:35.760]  get away with this it's rampant criminal activity it already is rampant but I
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:42.200]  mean more people continue to die in FBI custody they go pick people up they go
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.800]  to interview when they end up dead man arrested an FBI sting found dead in
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.400]  federal custody the guy they tried to blame the anthrax the third round Patsy
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.640]  the doctor they tried to blame for the anthrax attack we actually know who did
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:28:03.080]  it they killed him it was buried the news that he quote OD on prescription
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.640]  Tylenol and then this guy a Washington state man charged with plotting to blow
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:12.040]  up several buildings was found dead in federal custody Thursday see when they
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.600]  shut up these patsy's like Atari militia the judges end up releasing them
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.560]  because it turns out it's all-stage the new thing is just kill you and then they
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.440]  still get the headline that a domestic terrorist existed and then it doesn't
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.440]  come out it was all fake even the New York Times admitted almost every one of
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.520]  these events is totally made up or they find a mental patient folks I would never
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:35.120]  do this I'm saying hypothetically though I guarantee you and I wouldn't do it
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.840]  because they'd set me up and claim it was real I could go out and in five hours
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:44.440]  find a homeless person who was mentally ill and give them a few thousand dollars
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:48.000]  and give them alcohol and then give them a fake bomb and say go blow up the
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.760]  police station guaranteed and then if I was FBI put him in handcuffs take him
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:58.760]  into jail that's what they do in most cases they get mentally ill homeless
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:03.400]  people are mentally ill black people so they can claim their Muslims turns out
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.440]  they're not in almost every case and I'm not saying there aren't real Muslim
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.880]  terrorists the point is they're in the Middle East other areas there and it's
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.600]  in almost every case the Christmas tree bomber all of it look it up they are
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:20.040]  literally mental patients they are homeless former state hospital people
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:27.800]  or out of their mind crazy racist white people and who have like 75 IQs I had
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:32.880]  brain surgery I want to kill the blacks I mean they literally get people like
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.360]  that with one tooth who had brain surgery going I won't kill black people I
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:43.560]  won't kill I mean it's just totally fake and so now the new deal is
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:48.400]  they just get you in custody it's like oh he died in custody to never mind no
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:53.240]  investigation just all your calls are coming up the Empire is on the run

[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.480]  all want to give their take on who they think the greatest baloney master is the
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:47.880]  last 20 years we've got right now three votes for Obama one for bill clinton one
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:53.800]  for bagdad bob one for satan and one for just lying establishment roman's 13
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:58.920]  preachers in general again i'm your host alex jones now with the level of lies
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:04.560]  becoming just mega level by j carney also known as bagdad bob part 2 the
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:09.880]  american bagdad bob because of the fact that he's been knighted bagdad bob 2 and
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:12.520]  I'm kind of nominating him as well I mean I think he's a really important
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:16.400]  person when it comes to lying he says the new Benghazi memos they lot about
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:20.320]  those aren't about Benghazi even though they say they're about Benghazi so I
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:23.560]  mean he's kind of really pushing for first place there my view I am
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:27.560]  prejudicing things bagdad bob's incredible you know but I'm
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:32.880]  Obama's giving him a run for his money so Phil in Florida who do you think the
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.640]  greatest baloney master of all-time is in the last 20 years I'm definitely at
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:42.080]  say michael bloomberg in his every town campaign oh yeah when he said he's pro
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.680]  second amendment and doesn't want your guns he just believes second minute means
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.840]  handing them all in okay a mayor bloomberg here thank you keep going yep
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.760]  and and then then yeah the thing he's got going currently at the FedEx shooter
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:58.960]  I believe that's a total farce this kid getty clamor supposedly a 19 year old
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:03.880]  kid dressed like Rambo with camo and bullets across his chest conflicting
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:08.400]  news stories some say it was a assault rifle some say it was a shotgun he's
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:14.840]  got no Facebook no Twitter very few pictures available online he's driving
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:18.880]  the same type of car that supposedly adam landed broke the school behind the
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:24.280]  civic board or very few eyewitness accounts the events and the ones but
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:29.760]  every eyewitness account they stated that he's dressed like Rambo they make
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:33.760]  sure they punch that out to everybody and why are you questioning known

[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:58.680]  1300 a.m. what is your take on the greatest baloney master of the last 20
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:04.760]  years well I guess one specific individual just given that the sheer evil and
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:10.920]  sellout is George Soros I think maybe as a group I would say the city of London
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:15.560]  because everything perpetuates from their fake you know house of card money so
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:19.240]  that's that's kind of the angle I would go but Alex could you imagine going
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:22.920]  fishing with Obama say out in Galveston Bay and you know you catch a couple of
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:26.320]  specs and a couple of reds and you come into the dock and you start telling
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.920]  everybody what you get what you get you start telling Obama says oh y'all be
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:35.920]  quiet we got six six foot black tip sharks we got 18 flounder and we got a
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:39.880]  couple of porpoises and everybody's looking similar words to catch don't
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:42.960]  worry about it don't worry about it that's exactly what his administration is
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:48.880]  it's nothing but a fish story that's a good way to say it there it really is a
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:54.240]  fish story and it's a fish story that concerns our whole lives and the fraud
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.480]  just gets worse and worse we're waking up to it so their answer is to build up a
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:03.040]  paramilitary force against us a very interesting I hope you're spreading the
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.320]  word down there in Beaumont that's where my mother's mother is from I got a
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:11.160]  bunch of family down there that owns and runs Christmas tree farms and a lot of

[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.040]  area no doubt but uh you know I'm convinced we don't need everybody to
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:30.760]  wake up we just need the right people to wake up and that doesn't mean color or
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:34.880]  creed that means the right individual has an intellect to understand it and it
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:39.320]  just go out and say one person a day I will wake up and that's been my personal

[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:10.160]  folks over at media matters cannot envision one more person who is done
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:16.080]  more to damage our beautiful country and it's not just who's damaging us and who
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:21.120]  the big enemies are it's who tells the most flagrant giant lies out in the open

[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:30.680]  opinion on the uh the import export bank their charter is expiring this year
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:36.520]  guys like Soros make billions off their corporate welfare we need to expose them
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:41.520]  what's your point then sir well all these big globalist inside groups IMF
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.640]  World Bank XM Bank import export all of it are set deals so-called free trade
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:51.160]  deals that are it would take two will-bearers to carry the NAFTA documents
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:54.920]  more than that forget it's selectively written to shut down their competition
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:58.880]  to only let certain things going out of the country it's a bunch of rich guys
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:04.120]  rigging the economy for themselves and it's just outrageous I appreciate your
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.960]  call let's get thank you sir thank you my friend let's get John Bown and the
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.720]  rest of crew they want to chime in who do you guys individually think is the
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:19.520]  greatest liar currently remember you're up against Kim Jong-un who says that he
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.760]  makes the sunshine please don't hang out with Dennis Rodman in an obscene
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:28.640]  display of bizarreness we're up against Baghdad Bob it's not just America who is
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:33.760]  the greatest bsr well we we knew the odds were you know not in our favor but
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:39.720]  what we did was we hybridized the leader of the Federal Reserve which is not
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:43.200]  federal that's a big hoax it's not federal it's owned by foreign offshore
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:47.200]  banks mainly lie in the history of the world well Obamacare itself is a
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:50.800]  huge lie because it's written to gouge everybody too so it's almost as big but
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.080]  it's not the biggest lie itself the thing isn't the lie even though they are
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:42:00.240]  lies it's the biggest liar individually so who is that that would be
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:07.800]  Ben Yellen as that Bernanke and Yellen cross together Ben Bernanke and Janet
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:12.720]  Yellen hybridized who does that looks like some kind of like evil rat or
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:18.560]  something that also may be the professor that's living in that dumpster
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:22.440]  downtown that looks like like the grandmother of Janet Reno and Rachel
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:32.160]  Maddow lovely anyways what's that thing on Saturday Night Live Pat that is
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:36.120]  frightening that that you don't want to see that when you're well listen keep
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:40.320]  your opinions yourself I think that's a pretty good looking woman right there if
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.560]  you're into that well I mean remember police academy when they'd have the
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.840]  cops dressed up with the beards like women when they were like you know
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:53.800]  undercover that's our vote okay thank you is that really your vote let's be
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:57.600]  serious who think the biggest liar is the head of the Federal Reserve whoever
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:01.040]  that person may be that's a good point they just go along with the whole hoax
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.920]  that they're federal and everything just in the hoax is so big it works like
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:07.600]  Hitler said better the lie you agree with that CJ you agree with that Jordan
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.680]  absolutely it's kind of racist all right I mean I don't know why it's racist I'm
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:16.200]  just gonna throw that in there am I's will be all right let's go to Cindy in
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:20.160]  Pennsylvania thanks for holding Cindy just before you even talk I'm gonna say
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:26.520]  you're racist go ahead hey of course I am I'm white there you go and I have to
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:32.360]  vote for Erica Holder my reason being he's a Department of Justice he doesn't
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:36.120]  indict anybody for racketeering it's going on all across the country look at
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:41.440]  Harry Greed for God's sake and you just look at the guys in the government and
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:45.320]  the women the men look like women and the women look like men and they act that
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:50.760]  way too it's like my god I can't you say something racist or sexist I mean I
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:55.280]  don't even see any real men anymore in the government that's that's inherently
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.720]  sexist to say that men should be manly yeah well they shouldn't the women
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:04.000]  Hillary should be it looks like a man and Obama and Holder they look like
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.280]  women it's very confusing to me and and of course the Benghazi will go away
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.200]  because it's impeachable you can't have impeachable that's right the Republicans
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:19.640]  will just get bigger cuts of the swap pie by blackmailing obozo of course but
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:23.920]  they're all liars and get down to it they all lie they're all that's why
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:27.640]  there's we know it's getting worse though and nothing's gonna be left soon if
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:32.920]  we don't deal with these people but I hear you so you think the biggest liar
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:36.520]  is Eric Holder thank you so much we're gonna the next person here in a moment
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:40.320]  but here's the running one vote for Bill Clinton four votes for Obama he's way
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:44.480]  out in the lead Baghdad Bob only gets one vote Satan only gets one vote is the
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:51.280]  big liar Satan step aside for Obama corrupt establishment preachers get one
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:55.360]  vote Mary Bloomberg is one vote George Soros one vote Eric Holder one vote
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:01.040]  Janet Yellen cross with been Bernanke to create a lovely creature gets one vote
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:08.000]  so under a little picture of yelling right there so right now let's go ahead
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:14.120]  and go back to the calls let's talk to Chuck in Texas Chuck you're up to bat
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:21.080]  brother who who is who is the L Diablo Eric Holder Eric Holder gets two votes
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:27.280]  alright I'll tell you the biggest the biggest group of people or the
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:31.760]  American people for voting this should be a no-confidence vote well no no
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:35.120]  worldwide American people would probably get the most delusional most brainwash
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:43.560]  vote except for North Korea exactly good point any other points you'd like to
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:51.720]  make about saying it's Eric Holder I think he's the 21st century biggest liar
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:59.120]  I have to agree with that woman the call before me he's got a dead on Eric Holder
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.280]  is extremely dangerous is what he is I appreciate you calling in brother let's
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:11.040]  go ahead and talk to militia man from California and he says he's listening
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:14.840]  by tuning in I don't know I guess that means a local station go ahead militia
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:19.600]  man in California you're on the air hi are you doing there Alex this is a
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:23.920]  sergeant Joker Northern California State Militia I would also say that it's
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:29.520]  Eric Holder because he is supposed to be justice there is no justice I'd also
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:34.480]  like to make a few other points Webster terribly basically killed himself
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:39.240]  yesterday I hope all of you understand that well we wouldn't mean he's okay
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:44.840]  right no he's fine but I'm just saying what he said is gonna get him killed but
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:48.760]  he went on the air and killed himself I hope you'll everybody listening realize
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:51.560]  I don't want to get another talk show of some people I haven't had Tarpley on a
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:57.240]  long time he won't come on he likes Obama now and Hillary and you know thinks
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.120]  that you know the Republicans are the threat I've run into university
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:05.960]  professors up in Canada by interviewed him years ago and they said look we know
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:09.320]  9-11's an inside job but we don't want to say it because it discredits the state
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.480]  we want to get control of the state again and Tarpley doesn't want the state
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:19.000]  messed up he thinks it's good and he thinks discrediting it is a problem and
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:25.680]  then it's bad to say government's out of control and so you know he said things
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:31.440]  about Ron Paul that just aren't true and just really some nasty stuff and you know
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:34.880]  I'd like him to come on here and defend it I mean we put Tarpley from great
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:41.560]  respect on the map and he's got him his show on Genesis everything I like the
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:45.960]  guy as a person but one time he was down here we're interviewing somebody he
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.800]  brought down who was an open Marxist was talking about you know taking over the
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:53.800]  country and all this stuff and all of that and I was and and and Tarpley was
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:56.760]  like smiling about it I was like whoa Tarpley I don't agree with this I'm not
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:01.720]  a communist you know and I don't want to sit here and talk about about Tarpley
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:05.480]  it's just that's where that stands and you know when I don't worship Tarpley
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.600]  and agree with everything people like how dare you not agree with him on
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:10.680]  everything it's like I put the guy on the map to a great extent he'll admit
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:18.120]  that so I like interesting guests on but you know I'm just not into hardcore
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:21.640]  ultra leftist politics what did he specifically say so we're not on a
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:26.600]  cliffhanger here militia man what do you call killing himself on air no no I'm

[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:02.160]  what top talk show hosts are saying like yourself that you said years ago but
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:07.080]  taking credit for it and condemning people like you for the truth that they

[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:18.120]  hosts together but instead he has to criticize condemn you don't do that for
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:22.760]  people that are on your side if that's the side you're taking however when you
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:28.560]  sit there and say that you created or found out about agenda 21 and you wrote
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.720]  a book about it you've been talking about it for years that makes me question

[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:29.440]  of we haven't gotten to yet but these calls are great and bring up all the
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:33.360]  lies of these people we should expose it so the general public that isn't aware
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:39.320]  understands how serious this fascism is we're rapidly sinking into by
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:44.840]  partisanly but Obama and the globalist are the vanguard captains of where we're
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:52.400]  going I'm not allowed to reveal my sources and I don't try to know Glenbeck's
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.000]  business but obviously the level I'm at I'm gonna know it and I don't just go
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  off rumors Glenbeck got really freaked out by the stuff I said last week about
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  him about who's in his operation where he gets his money stuff like that and
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.400]  none of it's really bad other than the fact that they're directing you to attack
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:17.200]  me and that's the proof something isn't right and your talking points so just
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:21.280]  don't read White House talking points that are being given to you either by the
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:27.080]  FBI or the CIA against me I'll leave you alone I mean it's meant to set me up
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:31.360]  for destruction so if you corner me trying to destroy me I'm gonna come out
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:35.840]  against you I don't want to hurt anybody I don't want a civil war I don't want any
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:41.600]  cops to die I don't want to die I don't want to be fed into a wood chipper the
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:45.680]  globalists are gonna sit in Switzerland and offshore in Luxembourg while all
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:55.080]  this goes down and in Copenhagen so I don't want to be part of this okay I
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:00.480]  want to have a country I love America and it is a big deal because I got a
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.000]  transcript of what he said last week now that he backed off most things they'll
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:10.760]  probably attack again but the good news is you reached out to him and he is now
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:15.960]  backing down from trying to set up the Liberty Movement only because we called
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:21.800]  him on it but I don't think Beck in the final equation is a government agent I
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:26.120]  think he's being influenced and scared and I get why he's scared and Glenn you
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:31.800]  just have to get over it you have to just go with it whatever happens is gonna
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:36.600]  happen he's done a lot of great work just keep doing that work and stop
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:41.680]  transcend being a jerk to other people none of us are perfect I repent every
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:45.440]  day stuff I do but just transcend it because we don't want to see the
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:50.960]  globalists take over and then wish we'd have done more later now speaking of the
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:54.240]  shirt I'm wearing and by the way I'm gonna buy some more of these I really
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:57:01.200]  like how this this work shirt fits it's a security shirt Billy Corrigan of
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:06.400]  smashing pumpkins 40 million records sold great patriot daily listener says
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:13.960]  he'll come back on soon Billy Corrigan a couple months ago said I'm gonna get you
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:17.800]  something really special you're gonna like it it's really fun and I said okay
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:21.160]  what is it he's a walkie-talkie it's a surprise so there's a couple boxes came
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:24.680]  to the house and I was looking at him and busy on Monday and never opened them
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:31.760]  so to last night I finally opened it and it was this black official this is a
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:37.920]  real Bohemian Grove security outfit sent to me by Billy Corrigan and I don't know
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:42.760]  where he got it I'll just leave it at that you know let the mystery deepen but
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:49.560]  I just love to change their patch in uniform now but for those that don't
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:52.480]  know about Bohemian Grove can we play the cremation to care video where they
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:57.520]  the May 1st type burning of a child in FSU let's play that for folks there's
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:02.480]  been a lot of strange going on's in that area of Northern California but this is
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:08.240]  what the establishment is into right here in America
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:17.080]  fellowships eternal flame once again mid-summer sets us free
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:29.080]  all right there you go I was talking to a very prominent person who was a
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:33.640]  Bohemian Grove last year and they said that the old men look in the woods and
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:36.800]  think I'm there it's like I'm a boogeyman I'm a I'm a story because I've
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:47.240]  snuck in there more than once this is GCN the Genesis communications radio

[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:22.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:41.200]  finishing up with the Bohemian Grove news and Billy Corrigan Tim Fruge one of
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:45.080]  the managers up here in Info Wars heard me talking and I forgot back in one of
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:50.240]  my offices that's just full of all sorts of memorabilia I've been sent mainly by
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:55.600]  widows but also more video about workers the stuff is kind of skull and bones
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:00.440]  light Bohemian Grove where thousands of elite meet every year multiple times I'm
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:03.320]  the only person ever successfully infiltrate in and out and get in and
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:08.520]  out repeatedly in and out of the Bohemian Grove many have tried and
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:13.440]  failed I don't know why it's that hard but the issue is people just look
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:17.160]  nervous is the problem I've been questioned by Secret Service you name it
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:21.400]  infiltrating but here is some of the stuff we have sent to us over the years
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:26.240]  widows have sent us their internal annals it's usually when the guys die
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:30.840]  that's how we get them I mean the annals can sell for as much as $5,000 on eBay
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:35.440]  and we've got three of them here like where are those annals I should pull
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:38.640]  those out since we moved the offices around I don't know where all that stuff
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:43.240]  said but these are nice exhibits of the skull and bones type deal I want to be
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:48.000]  clear a lot of the people that go to it you got about 1,500 members and about a
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.280]  thousand guests that get called it's the one of the most elite clubs in the
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:56.960]  world global leaders are there Prince Charles German prime ministers or
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.000]  chancellors British prime ministers Russian leaders in the 50s would come
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.920]  secretly and meet with Eisenhower there that's all been declassified Ronald
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:09.920]  Reagan all of it Richard Nixon called it the most GD faggy thing he'd ever seen
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:15.600]  but he said he still had to go there and I mean that's really the backdrop of it
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:19.320]  is just let it all hang out doesn't mean it's like gay or the whole thing's a
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:25.720]  homoerotic of a vent but that's the backdrop is that everything and
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:31.120]  anything goes there and when I was there once for five hours I had to get into
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:35.120]  the bushes and hide because I had I mean I look good in 2000 you know we're like
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:40.480]  190 pounds 4% body weight you know look I didn't look Calvin Klein model like I
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:43.880]  looked five years before but I mean I was really good-looking and Mike Hansen
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:47.640]  was real good-looking then too and I mean we were being chased around by old men
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:52.040]  whistling at us and we tell you it was not a good feeling I mean I literally
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:56.240]  almost had like a newspaper on my butt running well then whistling and like
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:02.240]  oh guys trying to pinch my butt and Hansen goes let's go into this club
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:05.120]  because they have like hundreds of camps with like classical music playing and
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:09.640]  piano and all these guys and I walk in and guys are like hey not all of them but
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.040]  some of you know the heterosexuals go out and get hookers to nearby golf course
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:16.400]  that line up and flying there's just jets from all over the world there but I
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.800]  mean literally I haven't even told this part of the story but it's true I was
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:23.360]  going to the bathroom and a guy pinched me on the butt I mean I mean this is
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:29.080]  literally what is going on at Bohemian Grove and then there's a little
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:32.480]  satanic backdrop to it all that most people don't even get that but I was
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:38.720]  told by a prominent person off record a household name that they went last year
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:44.400]  and that it was ridiculous that all the old men you can actually go online and
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:48.680]  find the the Nixon tape I don't think I'll play it it's got profanity on it
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:54.320]  Nixon discusses what goes on Bohemian Grove I'll pull it up for you 737,000
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:58.880]  views I think we originally put that up can you put it back up no that's not
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:03.320]  our site but we originally put that up somebody I guess copied it back in 2006
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:08.000]  but there it is and of course you can see me right there talking about it on
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:14.300]  the sidebar on a RT Alex Jones discussions gay rituals of Bohemian
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:20.120]  Grove and that is what it's about I mean that's not all that it's about walking
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:24.520]  around the Bohemian Grove I would hear stuff like that we did excellent yes the

[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:32.160]  they would just fade off as I sat there for like two hours hiding in the bushes
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:36.040]  you know hearing the old men walk by because they would go out and walk on
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:39.040]  the paths where they didn't there were microphones they wouldn't even talk in
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:44.520]  the bunk houses about the stuff and it was just CIA NSA world leaders and I
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:48.520]  mean it was all Dr. Evil stuff but then I guess at night during the 15 days I
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:52.280]  mean it's I did see a photograph and so did John Ronson he's not getting with

[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:14.480]  indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:18.400]  pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:22.520]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:26.680]  million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and
[02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:30.720]  mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:33.960]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:38.040]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my
[02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:42.280]  lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:46.440]  that we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and

[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:24.920]  receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:28.920]  riders on the storm
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:32.920]  riders on the storm
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:36.920]  riders on the storm
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:40.920]  need to see your license and registration man
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:44.920]  I won't have to get any more invasive
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:48.920]  like a dog without a bone and
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:52.920]  actor out on loan
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:56.920]  riders on the storm
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:00.920]  there's a killer on the road
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:04.920]  his brain is squirming like a toad
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:08.920]  take a long holiday
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:12.920]  let your children play
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:16.920]  let your children play

[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:24.920]  killer on the road
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:28.920]  unbelievable voice right there
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:32.920]  I can listen to that voice and very few can sing like that
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:36.920]  Morrison didn't have as good a voice as Elvis Presley
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:40.920]  but it was Elvis like but it was still better in my view
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:44.920]  and there's only one person that can pull it off
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:48.920]  like Jim Morrison and that's Glenn Danzig
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:52.920]  I mean Glenn Danzig could be singing the phone book and I want to listen to it and I get it's dark music
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:56.920]  I'm not endorsing it it's just that I can't help it when I hear it
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:00.920]  there's a good part right here
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:04.920]  that's right taking by the hand
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:08.920]  girl you gotta love your man
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:12.920]  make him understand
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:16.920]  take him by the hand
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:20.920]  the world on you depends
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:24.920]  our life will never end
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:28.920]  you're not watching us on tv
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:32.920]  I'm wearing a bohemian grove security outfit
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:36.920]  and one of the guys had a mirrored aviator shades
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:40.920]  so it completed the outfit now if I had a mustache
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:44.920]  what would happen it would just be too much
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:48.920]  that's right
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:52.920]  all right ladies and gentlemen that's enough I should quit screwing around here
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:56.920]  we have a lot of serious news we're talking about the galactic level BSers
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:00.920]  and who are they and why do we love to hate them so much
[02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:04.920]  we're taking your votes right now and I'll go to a bunch of news
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:08.920]  the news overload bottom of the hour let's talk to Ronald in California
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:12.920]  Ronald's been patiently holding they're in Santa Cruz and into San Francisco
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:16.920]  and he's in San Diego 1340am one of two great affiliates we have in the area
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:20.920]  and Ronald thank you for coming on
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:24.920]  well Alex we've got them surrounded now
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:28.920]  for another good singer you ever hear Chris Isaac
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:32.920]  he's pretty good too
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:36.920]  hey you know who else listens on the station you're listening to right now
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:40.920]  Doris Day and then guess who else listens to the show
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:44.920]  I guess you know that okay
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:48.920]  yeah I want to say hi to Clint Eastwood we wish you would call into our show like you do Michael Savages
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:52.920]  we know you listen to both shows oh great one
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:56.920]  I knew Charlton Heston a little bit
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:00.920]  and I would just literally would love to talk to you
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:04.920]  because you're one of the greatest hard working phenomenon artists ever
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:08.920]  and I appreciate all you've done for Americana oh great leader Clint Eastwood
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:10.920]  he's got this good
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:14.920]  it's not right that he talks to the owner of the station and tells him stuff and won't come on my show
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:18.920]  of course we haven't really asked Clint Eastwood to come on because he's like so unreachable
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:22.920]  like up on Mount Olympus you guys go after Clint Eastwood whatever he wants to talk about
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:24.920]  okay I keep forgetting to do that go ahead
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:28.920]  you know how it is everybody bugs big shots and
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:32.920]  more importantly big shots have a disproportionate
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:36.920]  sense of fear of getting killed you know so
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:40.920]  the point is Clint Eastwood pumps his own gas man
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:44.920]  pardon you know Clint Eastwood pumps his own gas
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:46.920]  he's like a down-to-earth guy
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:50.920]  we all pump in California you guys still have the people pump your gas
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:54.920]  no what I mean is most people at his level have people that pump their gas
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:58.920]  it's not because they're elitists it's because they're so busy
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:02.920]  oh yeah well and they you know they want to keep their hands clean for signing autographs and stuff
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:06.920]  I grew up near near Bohemian Grove
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:10.920]  that's Sonoma County is 130 miles from Santa Cruz
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:14.920]  so here's the thing the topic
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:18.920]  I'm going to give you three clues and see if you can guess
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:22.920]  if this agency has a secret budget
[02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:26.920]  it has actually a license to kill people
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:30.920]  and it actually has a very good image in people's
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:34.920]  minds in America
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:38.920]  it actually has a secret budget
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:42.920]  it actually kills people it seemingly has a license
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:46.920]  to kill people and yet it has a
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:50.920]  seemingly good image in most Americans mind
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:54.920]  the CIA? no it's the FBI
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:58.920]  it's literally FBI and somebody told me even in Washington
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:02.920]  DC everyone including Supreme Court Justice
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:06.920]  is afraid of the FBI
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:10.920]  that's why you know they come in on all these local
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:14.920]  false flag operations these cities they're the lead they're the top dog
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:18.920]  on all the local police departments they well no I mean look most FBI
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:22.920]  agents are like Boy Scouts and are hardworking but there are compartmentalized hit teams
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:26.920]  it was the FBI any terror group that led the ATF
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:30.920]  Oklahoma City we even have their hotel receipts and the names and witnesses that saw them there
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:34.920]  so yes when someone comes to kill you a lot of times it's FBI
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:38.920]  but or they cover it up but or they cover it up but
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:42.920]  let me tell you who really kills people you want to know who does the killing in this country
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:46.920]  I'll tell you who does most of the hanging around here
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:50.920]  it's non commissioned and commissioned army officers
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:54.920]  she dipped into one of more than 14 different agencies
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:58.920]  who are in every town and city
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:02.920]  awaiting target orders on who to kill
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:06.920]  like the born movies like the born identity movies
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:10.920]  that's exactly how it is
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:14.920]  so this is the trouble with famous people you know
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:18.920]  really famous people why they don't speak out but if everybody starts speaking out
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:22.920]  and if we point out to everybody in the system this is a fraud
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:26.920]  people aren't going to follow orders they're not going to go along with it that's already happening
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:30.920]  it's why they're going early to mercenaries I got to jump I got to jump go to the callers
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:34.920]  but you made a lot of really good points a really good caller
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:38.920]  I have multiple articles today on infowars.com
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:42.920]  where people get arrested by the FBI or taken in to be questioned and ended up dead
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:46.920]  and they're getting away with it in the cover up the Boston bombing their friend
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:50.920]  they're getting away with it with this now and it'll get to the point where you can't talk to the
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:54.920]  FBI or go anywhere with them because you'll literally disappear into a black van
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:58.920]  so that's how civil war start if the FBI
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:02.920]  continues to kill people in their custody then everyone will know it's
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:06.920]  a death sentence to go with them and then it goes to the next level
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:10.920]  where people have to defend themselves offensively this is a very dangerous
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:14.920]  situation when the FBI becomes death squads they killed the third
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:18.920]  patsy on the anthrax situation they killed
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:22.920]  one of the Chechens that was friends with the brothers and knew that they were all really
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:26.920]  CIA assets they've now killed this guy and I mean
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:30.920]  the Chechen didn't have weapons nothing they shot him in the back of the head
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:34.920]  I mean is the FBI going to come to my house tell me to sit down and shoot me in the back of the head
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:38.920]  just go he shot him in the back of the head no big deal you know the holder says it's okay
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:42.920]  I mean there comes a time where you know just
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:46.920]  reality sets in man arrested an FBI
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:50.920]  found dead in federal custody FBI supplied fake explosives for alleged space needle
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:54.920]  Walmart gas station bombings Larry Gillette
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:58.920]  a Washington state man charged with plotting to blow up several buildings was found dead
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:02.920]  in federal custody Thursday only days after being arrested during an elaborate
[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:06.920]  FBI sting according to federal agents 53 year old Larry Gillette
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:10.920]  who was just serving a senate for identity theft told federal inmates that he planned
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:14.920]  to blow up a Walmart two gas stations and a
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:18.920]  division for three bank robberies once he left prison
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:22.920]  it's always Oregon and Washington where they set people up for that
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:26.920]  wanting to blow something up for diversion of a bank robbery it's like the script they follow
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:30.920]  an anonymous federal law enforcement source speaking to reporters on Cairo radio
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:34.920]  also said that Gillette had plans to blow up Seattle's iconic space needle
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:38.920]  and see they need these every few weeks just a made up report oh this guy was going to do this
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:42.920]  this guy was going to do that and then they just die
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:46.920]  Gillette unknowingly met an undercover officer and received four inappropriate
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:50.920]  inoperable pistols as well as defective car bomb
[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:54.920]  report state Gillette met with an officer and it goes on
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:58.920]  and then now it's been reported that less than a week later Gillette
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:02.920]  was found dead in his shell at the C. Tack federal detention center
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:06.920]  the U.S. also a FEMA center there the U.S. Federal
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:10.920]  Bureau of Presidents announced his debt the following day saying hospital workers were unsuccessful
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:14.920]  attempts to revive Gillette from a suspected suicide
[02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:22.920]  that's a really good one let's get one more call in

[02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:05.800]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:10.280]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[02:32:10.280 --> 02:32:13.840]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:16.800]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:20.720]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect

[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:28.240]  I take morning, noon, and night supermail vitality.
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:40.240]  Naysan iodine survival shield, fluoride shield, the lung cleanse and now I am looking at just really expanding what I personally take.
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:45.240]  Now I used to only take a half a dose of the survival or the supermail vitality.
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:49.240]  I take more than a dose of survival shield but I've built up with this to the regular dose.
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:50.240]  Now a lot of people take more.
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:51.240]  Just consult your physician.
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:55.240]  It's concentrated super herbs and fruit extracts and it's no joke.

[02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:07.240]  What it's doing to you and CJ is in really good shape.
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:08.240]  Is he in there?
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:09.240]  I can't see him.
[02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:10.240]  Yeah I'm here.
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:11.240]  Yeah CJ tell folks I didn't plan this.
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:12.240]  This isn't planned does it?
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:13.240]  No sir.
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:14.240]  Totally impromptu.
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:16.240]  Tell me your honest response to what it does.
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:21.240]  I would say I just feel less drowsy and more more alert.
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:23.240]  A little bit more even keeled.
[02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:25.240]  Even keeled stimulant.
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:27.240]  With an aphrodisiac effect it's incredible.
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:28.240]  Yeah.
[02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:30.240]  And we did it as super male to be in shape.
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:31.240]  Loose weight.
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:32.240]  Have your glands be healthy.
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:33.240]  I'm interrupting.
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:34.240]  Go ahead and tell folks.
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:36.240]  I feel a little bit more on the ball.
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:42.240]  I'd say when things are tense around the studio because it's a news environment and we all
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:43.240]  have a lot going on.
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:45.240]  A lot of stresses trying to cover things.
[02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:47.240]  Trying to get everything on time on the ball.
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:49.240]  It's just easier to deal with.
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:52.240]  I can remember things faster.
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:56.240]  And physically I'm pretty healthy.
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:41:57.240]  I can't say that.
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:58.240]  No you're pretty young guy.
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:41:59.240]  You're in good shape.
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:00.240]  About six foot three.
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:01.240]  Yeah.
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:02.240]  Yeah.
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:03.240]  Energy.
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:04.240]  Do I guess your height correctly?
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:05.240]  Do I guess your height correctly?
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:06.240]  Yeah.
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:07.240]  Six foot three.
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:08.240]  Anyways.
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:09.240]  I sleep a little better.
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:10.240]  That's weird.
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:11.240]  Didn't expect that.
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:12.240]  Well that's what Steiner said.
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:13.240]  He was in the weight lifting forever.
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:14.240]  I knew him back in high school.
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:15.240]  He was doing it.
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:16.240]  He was just burn out.
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:19.240]  He'd hit that wall using regular supplements.
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:20.240]  And he got on.
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:21.240]  He's like I need more of that.
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:22.240]  No joke.
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:24.240]  He's glowing when he comes in here.
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:25.240]  He's lost 30 pounds.
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:26.240]  He's more ripped than ever.
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:27.240]  Lifting as much weight.
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:30.240]  And he just literally now his whole family is taking it.
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:32.240]  His dad, his brother, you name it.
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:34.240]  We got the female vitality coming out soon.
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:36.240]  Quite frankly, we tweaked it a little bit.
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:37.240]  That's kind of a gimmick.
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:39.240]  This stuff works better on women.
[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:42.240]  Has your wife taken it yet, CJ?
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:43.240]  Not yet.
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:44.240]  I'm scared.
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:45.240]  I don't want to turn into a monster.
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:48.240]  She has a hard time keeping her hands off me already.
[02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:50.240]  That's good.
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:52.240]  You know how many kids I got.
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:53.240]  Yeah.
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:54.240]  How many you got?
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:55.240]  Awesome.
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:56.240]  Plenty.
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:42:57.240]  Awesome.
[02:42:57.240 --> 02:42:59.240]  That's a good woman right there, buddy.
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:00.240]  Anyways.
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:01.240]  All right.
[02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:02.240]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:04.240]  So it sounds like she's already got her vitality stuff.
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:06.240]  She doesn't need anything extra.
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:11.240]  But seriously, and the more maxed out and deficient you are.
[02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:13.240]  Oh, we're just talking about Steiner.
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:14.240]  Get him in here.
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:15.240]  I didn't even know you were in here.
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:17.240]  Push aside my thundercloud sub.
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:19.240]  There's like food where your seat is.
[02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:21.240]  This is not, this is all, come on.
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:22.240]  Sit down.
[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:23.240]  Don't get nervous.
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:24.240]  You're on air right now.
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:25.240]  All right.
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:26.240]  You didn't know you were in.
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:28.240]  I didn't know you were here.
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:29.240]  No.
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:30.240]  Here.
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:31.240]  Just go ahead and move it in front of you.
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:32.240]  Wow.
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:33.240]  That's where you only come in or maybe once a week.
[02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:34.240]  What's going on?
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:35.240]  Nothing.
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:36.240]  Move the mic in front of you, Lordship.
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:37.240]  Anyways.
[02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:38.240]  Well, you're all dandied up.
[02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:39.240]  Where are you going?
[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:43.240]  Oh, just, you know, this is why I normally dress.
[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:45.240]  Just move the camera a little bit that way, folks.
[02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:47.240]  I get obsessed with the aspect ratio.
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:48.240]  There we go.
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:49.240]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:50.240]  A little bit more that way.
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:51.240]  Yeah.
[02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:52.240]  So what are you up here doing?
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:54.240]  I'm just, you know, coming to see the crew hanging out.
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:57.240]  Let me ask you, who's the biggest BS for the last 20 years?
[02:43:57.240 --> 02:43:58.240]  Is it Baghdad Bob?
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:44:00.240]  Is it, is it Bill Clinton?
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:01.240]  Is it Obama?
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:03.240]  Is it Kim Jong-un?
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:07.240]  Um, I have to go with like air, air colder.
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:08.240]  Wow.
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:09.240]  He's getting a lot of votes.
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:10.240]  Is he?
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:12.240]  We're up to four votes on holder.
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:13.240]  Well, he should.
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:14.240]  I don't know.
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:15.240]  What about Baghdad Bob?
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:17.240]  I mean, he said that the US wasn't even in Iraq.
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:18.240]  Oh, yeah.
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:19.240]  They were winning.
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:21.240]  They, they crushed the American forces.
[02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:22.240]  Yeah.
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:23.240]  They were pushed back.
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:24.240]  Yeah.
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:25.240]  Have you heard Carney now?
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:26.240]  They have all these memos that say Benghazi.
[02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:28.240]  It was those aren't Benghazi memos.
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:30.240]  No, I didn't hear that.
[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:31.240]  Well, it's true.
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:32.240]  He said it.
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:33.240]  Oh, of course.
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:35.240]  He said, if you don't believe it, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:37.240]  Well, yeah, we're all conspiracy theorists here.
[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:38.240]  This was not planned, was it?
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:39.240]  No, this is not planned.
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:42.240]  I just heard my, I heard my name and I was taking my supermail vitality.
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:44.240]  Were you ever getting more?
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:45.240]  I was getting more.
[02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:46.240]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:47.240]  I handed it out to all your friends.
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:48.240]  I'm going to go bankrupt.
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:52.240]  Tell folks what it, tell people in one minute what it, some of what it's done.
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:59.240]  Well, I'll tell you, I was, you know, we've done several videos on it, but I was feeling
[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:02.240]  really depressed and overweight and out of shape.
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:05.240]  And man, it's changed my life really.
[02:45:05.240 --> 02:45:07.240]  More importantly, are you taking me boating tomorrow?
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:08.240]  Yes, we're going late.
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:10.240]  That's the other thing I was going to talk to you about.
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:11.240]  Yeah.
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:12.240]  I'm buying steaks.
[02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:14.240]  Amy's buying steaks right now.
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:16.240]  We're going to rib-eyes.
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:17.240]  You like rib-eyes?
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:19.240]  That sounds kind of, yeah, of course I like rib-eyes.
[02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:20.240]  We always eat over there.
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:21.240]  Yeah.
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:23.240]  Of course we always go to your steakhouse and eat them.
[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:26.240]  Yeah, but it's, it's more fun when we get to grill and.
[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:27.240]  I agree.
[02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:31.240]  But we ought to invent, we ought to invite Matt over the chef and have him cook them
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:32.240]  for us.
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:33.240]  We'll do that.
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:34.240]  Or your dad, he really knows how to cook them.
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:35.240]  Oh, my dad, he's the best.
[02:45:35.240 --> 02:45:36.240]  You know how to cook them better than I do though.
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:37.240]  No.
[02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:40.240]  Well, I'm, I'm a little out of practice because I go to the steakhouse.
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:43.240]  So I usually let Matt cook them, but yeah, I need to.
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:48.240]  You guys have a steakhouse because your dad didn't want to drive too far to get a steak.
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:49.240]  That's not completely true.
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:50.240]  Well, I heard that.
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:54.240]  Well, there just wasn't really good steakhouses around that, that he liked.
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:55.240]  So.
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:59.240]  This is not a plug for the Steiner steakhouse, but it is the best steak in Austin.
[02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:00.240]  I think so.
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:04.240]  You invited me out Wednesday to hear you play and I'm glad you're getting back to playing
[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:05.240]  your music.
[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:06.240]  That's another thing.
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:09.240]  I mean, I never thought in a million years that I would start playing again.
[02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:13.240]  And just because I'm, I'm feeling good and I'm, you know, my mind's coming back.
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:17.240]  It's just, you know, I picked up a guitar one day and was like, why am I not doing
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:18.240]  this anymore?
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:22.240]  So you had number two is number three is you name it in the country charts were extremely
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:26.240]  successful, but you literally walked away from it all in Nashville because you were
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:27.240]  so sick of it.
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:31.240]  And, you know, you told me you've been kind of bummed out like last few years.
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:34.240]  And, and you really think how much of it was super male?
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:36.240]  You've been going to church and stuff too.
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:38.240]  You know, I, I don't know.
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:42.240]  I just know that, that since I started taking it, I just feel so much better.
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:48.240]  I, and when you feel better and your, your health is there, you know, that just, it opens
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:49.240]  up everything.
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:53.240]  Well, used to, I'd come up here and work on Saturday, but I mean, I've learned to go
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:56.240]  out, have fun with the kids, then I'm more relaxed when I come back.
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:57.240]  That's another thing.
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:46:59.240]  Like I wasn't like for the last couple of years, I wasn't even playing with my kids.
[02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:07.240]  I was just lay on the couch and watch TV and now I'm out doing stuff and, and living life.
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:09.240]  I literally describe a super male dead for you.
[02:47:09.240 --> 02:47:12.240]  Well, I mean, again, I wouldn't have taken it unless we were friends.
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:17.240]  I mean, I've tried every, every, uh, concoction, concoction that there is.
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:19.240]  And, and most of it is bogus.
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:24.240]  And I honestly thought it, this was going to be one of those, you know, uh, placebo kind
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:25.240]  of things.
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:31.240]  And, and when I started taking it immediately within 15 minutes, you feel it kind of rushing
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:33.240]  and give you like an energy boost.
[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:38.240]  But over the long haul, like as weeks went by, my body started changing.
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:43.240]  If I wanted to put on muscle mass, it just, it just started to pack on.
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:47.240]  And then I decided that I was going to lean up and get, get lean.
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:51.240]  As you're going back to Nashville, I was going to take this away so you don't leave town.
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:56.240]  I was going to take some pictures and I, you know, my head was, you know, enormous.
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:47:59.240]  So I decided I was going to lean up a little bit.
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:03.240]  And so I just changed my diet a little bit and, and it responded.
[02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:07.240]  I dropped like 35 pounds and I feel great.
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:08.240]  So it's all things to you.
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:09.240]  No, no, no.
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:10.240]  It's Dr. Group.
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:11.240]  How much are you taking?
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:12.240]  It's the bigger question.
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:15.240]  Uh, I do take a little more than it says.
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:16.240]  Don't say it on it.
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:18.240]  Oh, but not much.
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:20.240]  I, I twice a day.
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:24.240]  And I've got the emergency room with like a three week long erection.
[02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:25.240]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:26.240]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:27.240]  I apologize.
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:28.240]  Family show.
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:31.240]  It's not an easy act, but that's the effect it has.
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:35.240]  From all the friends that I've given it to, that's like the first thing they call me and say,
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:38.240]  why didn't you explain to me the side effects?
[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:43.240]  And, uh, so yeah, we should probably start letting people know that, that that does happen.
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:45.240]  Yeah, it's not advertised as that.
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:50.240]  And, and, and the larger issue is we've got so many estrogen members in us that when we
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:53.240]  finally get something in there to blocks them, it just is, it's night and day.
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:55.240]  This is what we're supposed to be like.
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:48:56.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:56.240 --> 02:49:03.240]  Uh, I don't think people realize what having, uh, having your, uh, your, your body out of
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:07.240]  whack, all the, the estrogen too high and your testosterone too low, what all that does
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:08.240]  to you.
[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:14.240]  And, uh, you, you get all these health problems from, from having low testosterone.
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:17.240]  Well, I mean, I gave you the challenge and within one month you, you were ready to endorse
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:18.240]  it.
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:20.240]  So I appreciate you doing that, brother.
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:22.240]  Infowarslife.com helps support the broadcast.
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:24.240]  I meant to cover a bunch of news and take calls.
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:28.240]  I did not mean to just mention it and say, Oh, I got to take it and then get what CJ
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:29.240]  was saying.
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:31.240]  And then you literally, I just, I don't know.
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:33.240]  Hey, wait, what time do you want me to come over tomorrow?
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:34.240]  Uh, noon.
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:35.240]  Okay.
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:36.240]  Good.
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:40.240]  And I guess we'll, uh, eat some steaks or go boat and first any steaks.
[02:49:40.240 --> 02:49:41.240]  Whatever you want to do.
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:42.240]  Don't look at the American dream, buddy.
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:43.240]  All right.
[02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:44.240]  All right.
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:45.240]  Well, a good seeing you brother.
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:46.240]  All right.
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:47.240]  Take care.
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:48.240]  There goes Shane Steiner, my old high school buddy.
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:51.240]  And, uh, he's here in the studio with us.
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:52.240]  There he goes.
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:53.240]  All right.
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:56.240]  Now I'm completely out of control, completely behind in everything.
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:50:01.240]  I'll have to do some overdrive to get the final votes from Andrew Mercedes Carl.
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:03.240]  Joanne, I think you're Joanne.
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:07.240]  I can't read the Johnny and then Phil.
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:08.240]  So that's all coming up.
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:10.240]  But Obama hands down as the biggest liar.
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:12.240]  Then it's Eric Holder so far.
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:15.240]  And then, um, the FBI gets one vote.
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:16.240]  Bloomberg gets one vote.
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:17.240]  Bagdad Bob gets one vote.
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:19.240]  Satan gets one vote.
[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:21.240]  That's kind of stuff going on in my chicken scratch.
[02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:23.240]  So we're going to be breaking all that down.
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:25.240]  But I will news blitz when we come back.
[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:26.240]  I mean, look at this story.
[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:28.240]  We got a nightly news story about this tonight.
[02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:32.240]  This is RT, but also in Yahoo News, AFB.
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:34.240]  Coming soon, a brain implant to restore memory.
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:37.240]  DARPA working on brain implants to help restore memory.
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:38.240]  And guess what?
[02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:40.240]  They want it for soldiers.
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:42.240]  Human skin used to create sperm.
[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:43.240]  London Telegraph.
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:47.240]  Feds considered taking Alaskan tribal land.
[02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:49.240]  Las Vegas Sun told you that was coming.
[02:50:49.240 --> 02:50:51.240]  They aren't going to stop.
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:53.240]  They're going to steal everything because they're not feds.
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:55.240]  They're pirates in control of the feds.
[02:50:55.240 --> 02:50:58.240]  Payrolls in U.S. rise most in 2012.
[02:50:58.240 --> 02:51:01.240]  Total bulls straight ahead.
[02:51:01.240 --> 02:51:02.240]  Hey, this is Steve Sanchez.
[02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:04.240]  Worried about the Wall Street casino?
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:05.240]  Yeah, me too.

[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:33.240]  Have you ever wondered why banks,
[02:51:33.240 --> 02:51:36.240]  stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:38.240]  They've been available since 1986,
[02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:40.240]  yet the financial industry won't recognize
[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:42.240]  the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:44.240]  Gold is outperformed paper investments,
[02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:45.240]  yet no word about IRAs.
[02:51:45.240 --> 02:51:47.240]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement,
[02:51:47.240 --> 02:51:50.240]  call 800-686-2237.

[02:52:00.240 --> 02:52:02.240]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:04.240]  in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:06.240]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:08.240]  had their drinking water contaminate.
[02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:10.240]  What are the health effects of having these drugs
[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:12.240]  in our drinking water?
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:14.240]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent
[02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:15.240]  of residents.
[02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:18.240]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions
[02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:20.240]  you can take to protect you and your family
[02:52:20.240 --> 02:52:22.240]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:25.240]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate
[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:26.240]  at least once a week.
[02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:28.240]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[02:52:28.240 --> 02:52:31.240]  that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:33.240]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,

[02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:39.240]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and waters
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:41.240]  and breads and toothpaste.
[02:52:41.240 --> 02:52:43.240]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:52:43.240 --> 02:52:45.240]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:46.240]  It's time to take action.
[02:52:46.240 --> 02:52:48.240]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:54:06.240 --> 02:54:08.240]  The Alex Jones Show,
[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:11.240]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:31.240]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:34.240]  it is the final segment of the official transmission,
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:37.240]  getting some of the other news here.
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:39.240]  All over the country, they're doing military drills
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:41.240]  with explosions and gunshots in the cities
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:43.240]  on record to condition the public.
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:45.240]  And back when this was first happening
[02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:47.240]  in the early 90s under Clinton,
[02:54:47.240 --> 02:54:49.240]  they would just say it didn't exist,
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:51.240]  helicopters didn't do this. Remember that?
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:55.240]  Oh, I think I heard Sergeant Sam Cox locally on 590 a.m.
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:57.240]  one of our local affiliates this morning
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:54:59.240]  talking about how Obama wants our guns,
[02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:01.240]  and the co-host was saying,
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:04.240]  you're a black helicopter conspiracy person, it's like Carney.
[02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:06.240]  There's no Benghazi memo. It says that.
[02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:09.240]  That's not what it is. There's no black helicopters.
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:12.240]  Infowars.com, black ops, helicopters,
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:14.240]  buzz, Kentucky residents,
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:18.240]  hearing drills unannounced with explosions, you name it.
[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:21.240]  Again, it's just amazing.
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:24.240]  HSBC demands to know how customers spend their money,
[02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:26.240]  is now asking people as little as $1,000
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:29.240]  in their account what they're buying and what they're doing.
[02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:32.240]  Unbelievable. That's up on infowars.com.
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:35.240]  In Ukraine, crisis,
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:39.240]  rebels are now downing army helicopters,
[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:42.240]  Ukrainian helicopters that fly over Russian-held cities.
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:45.240]  Pro-Russian rebels have shot down two of Ukraine's army helicopters
[02:55:45.240 --> 02:55:49.240]  during anti-terror operation in the eastern city of Slovansk,
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:51.240]  if I'm pronounced that right.
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:53.240]  Slovansk, Kiev has said.
[02:55:53.240 --> 02:55:57.240]  Ukrainian troops begin special operations in Slovaks.
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:00.240]  Again, the people that don't want to be under Ukrainian control, they're terrorists.
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:03.240]  But when the Ukrainian people over through the elected government,
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:05.240]  they were called patriots. I'm just pointing this out.
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:07.240]  I'm not on the Russian side, folks.
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:10.240]  This is bad, period.
[02:56:10.240 --> 02:56:14.240]  So that is just some of the news on that front.
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:18.240]  Meanwhile, I saw this story out of AP.
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:23.240]  700 migrants rush at Spain's border, 140 breach it.
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:27.240]  Africa is collapsing, especially after Libya was taken down.
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:30.240]  It was helping all of northern and central Africa.
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:33.240]  I'm not saying he's a good guy, I'm just saying,
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:35.240]  compared to the globalists, he was like mother's milk.
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:37.240]  I mean, Gaddafi was literally building dams,
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:41.240]  literally building up, giving medicine to Africa.
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:43.240]  And now it is imploding.
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:48.240]  Look, we just can't take all the people from the 7 billion people or whatever,
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:51.240]  or 6.5 billion that went into Europe or the U.S.
[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:54.240]  They can't do it, especially when they all get welfare.
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:57.240]  We're already bankrupt and imploding.
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:02.240]  Around 700 African migrants charge Spain's barbed wire border fence
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:06.240]  Thursday in the country's north, African enclave,
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:09.240]  clashing with Spanish and Moroccan border police.
[02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:12.240]  And why do they want into the area that has European culture?
[02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:14.240]  Because Europe's not been perfect,
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:16.240]  but compared to a lot of the other cultures,
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:20.240]  at least it had some Christianity to build some civilization.
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:23.240]  And when Rome fell and the Dark Ages came,
[02:57:23.240 --> 02:57:25.240]  there was only Christianity that survived.
[02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:28.240]  And you can argue it helped contribute to the Dark Ages,
[02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:32.240]  but if you really study history, it's the only reason any civilization made it, folks.
[02:57:32.240 --> 02:57:33.240]  That's the facts.
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:38.240]  And civilization is on the verge of collapse, quite frankly.
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:40.240]  How'd you like to wake up and hear this?
[02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:44.240]  KKK Neighborhood Watch Proposal makes Pennsylvania Townsfolk uneasy.
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:47.240]  The KKK is setting up their own Neighborhood Watch.
[02:57:47.240 --> 02:57:50.240]  The main issue is you're going to have a Neighborhood Stozy Watch program.
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:53.240]  It sounds okay, but what about anti-liberty people?
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:56.240]  That's more threatening than the KKK, because it's actually organized.
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:57:59.240]  But the KKK does have a history of persecuting people.
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:01.240]  I'm totally creeped out by that.
[02:58:01.240 --> 02:58:04.240]  I don't think we should have Neighborhood Watch.
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:06.240]  You should organize it yourself if you want to,
[02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:08.240]  not have it organized by the system.
[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:11.240]  The system is already too corrupt.
[02:58:11.240 --> 02:58:14.240]  Payrolls in U.S. rise most since 2012.
[02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:17.240]  Unemployment at 6.3%.
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:18.240]  That's totally cooked.
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:21.240]  They go on to say that the economy grew at 0.1, though.
[02:58:21.240 --> 02:58:22.240]  That's the pressure level.
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:23.240]  That's cooked numbers.
[02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:25.240]  Again, they're kicking people off full-time jobs
[02:58:25.240 --> 02:58:27.240]  and cutting them down to lower than 30.
[02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:29.240]  They're having to get second jobs.
[02:58:29.240 --> 02:58:32.240]  This is how they say they've hired more people with pure statistics.
[02:58:32.240 --> 02:58:35.240]  Show more hoaxes, more frauds, more lies.
[02:58:35.240 --> 02:58:38.240]  We're going into Overdrive, infowars.com,
[02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:41.240]  sportslifeshow, Nightly News Tonight 7.
[02:58:41.240 --> 02:58:44.240]  And then I'll be back this Sunday, 4-6
[02:58:44.240 --> 02:59:13.240]  with an original, transmission-send-trial Overdrive coming up.
[02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:40.240]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4-6.
[02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:45.240]  I have secured a discount for my listeners when you visit AlexJonesDallas.com.
[02:59:45.240 --> 02:59:47.240]  Again, that's AlexJonesDallas.com.
[02:59:47.240 --> 03:00:13.240]  I have secured your tickets to this one-time event, and I'll see you in Dallas.
[03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:24.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, AlexJones.
[03:00:24.240 --> 03:00:28.240]  All right, let's see if these next five, six callers can vote for somebody else
[03:00:28.240 --> 03:00:31.240]  and defeat Obama as the greatest liar in the last 20 years.
[03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:33.240]  Andrew, thanks for holding. Go quick, please.
[03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:36.240]  Who do you think the greatest liar is?
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:38.240]  I'm going to have to add on to Obama.
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:41.240]  I feel bad now. It's just too easy to do.
[03:00:41.240 --> 03:00:43.240]  Well, don't let me prejudice your vote.
[03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:46.240]  I just want to share a quick story
[03:00:46.240 --> 03:00:48.240]  about delusional California.
[03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:51.240]  I live in a place that needs jobs in Walmart,
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:55.240]  who I'm no fan of came in and said they wanted to build a distribution center.
[03:00:55.240 --> 03:01:01.240]  The environmentalist said no, because the pollution the trucks would cause is terrible,
[03:01:01.240 --> 03:01:06.240]  but everybody's happy because we have a decommissioned military Air Force base
[03:01:06.240 --> 03:01:12.240]  and Google is coming in to test their driverless cars and their balloon internet.
[03:01:12.240 --> 03:01:16.240]  Which will get rid of the people being able to have jobs and is being used to control us.
[03:01:16.240 --> 03:01:19.240]  Great point. Thank you so much for calling.
[03:01:19.240 --> 03:01:20.240]  Great point, Andrew.
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:24.240]  Mercedes, Mercedes in Oregon, you're on the air.
[03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:33.240]  Yes, my vote is, and this is the only time this person's ever getting my vote,
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:38.240]  is for Hillary Clinton, because as Timothy pointed out,
[03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:46.240]  there are a lot of women that are not holding up to the values of the Constitution
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:57.240]  and doing business deals, but you're asking me to find Waldo when everybody is Waldo.
[03:01:57.240 --> 03:02:02.240]  It's like everybody's corrupt. Everything's false.
[03:02:02.240 --> 03:02:10.240]  We have to work on that basis. We have to find the solutions and keep promoting those
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:22.240]  and arm everybody with the truth of what is going on so no one can be in this denial anymore.
[03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:25.240]  Great point. We have to wake up out of our slumber and admit the hoax.
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:31.240]  Have a great weekend, Mercedes. Carl in Virginia. Carl, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:40.240]  Yeah, this is a really difficult one. You see, Satan is not human and he's the father of life.
[03:02:40.240 --> 03:02:47.240]  Barack Obama, greatest human BS artist there ever was, it seems,
[03:02:47.240 --> 03:02:52.240]  and then runner up to him would be my cousin Hillary Clinton.
[03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:54.240]  She's really your cousin?
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:03:01.240]  Well, she's my 11th cousin once removed and George W. Bush is my 10th cousin,
[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:06.240]  so that would probably make Barack Obama a distant cousin to me.
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:08.240]  Oh, it does. They're all interrelated. That's true. Wow.
[03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:20.240]  Bush, because Bush is cousins with Barack.
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:27.240]  Very, very interesting, sir. Thank you. Okay, so who's your vote for Obama or Satan?
[03:03:27.240 --> 03:03:34.240]  Did he vote? Let's talk to he voted Obama. Sean in Montana, you're on the air.
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:39.240]  I don't think Obama can be beaten now. He's the number one liar. Good. Good. Go ahead.
[03:03:39.240 --> 03:03:41.240]  Everybody, am I coming in clear?
[03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:43.240]  You're coming in clear, buddy. Who are you voting for?
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:50.240]  Thank you. I'm over here in Billings, Montana, and for about a year, they've set up all these health towers within like two years
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:53.240]  and they have drones flying around out here.
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:03:56.240]  No, those don't exist. They called me a liar, but there's no drones.
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:02.240]  What do they call it? Gasoline effect? Is that right? Gaslighting. Gaslighting.
[03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:07.240]  Well, Obama's definitely hands down the biggest liar of all time, I believe.
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:10.240]  Well, he's certainly one of the most bold, but I don't know.
[03:04:10.240 --> 03:04:14.240]  Bob's up there. Kim Jong-un says he makes the sun shine. I think that's...
[03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:17.240]  But it is approaching Kim Jong-un levels. I appreciate your call.
[03:04:17.240 --> 03:04:22.240]  I'm sorry I'm out of time with Sean and Chad and everybody. I'm just out of time.
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:26.240]  Real fast, Chad. Okay, he already hung up. I was going to say who he's voting for.
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:31.240]  Okay, drum roll, please, folks. Obama clearly wins it with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine votes.
[03:04:31.240 --> 03:04:34.240]  The runner-up is Eric Holder with four votes.
[03:04:34.240 --> 03:04:43.240]  Obama is the 2014 holder of the coveted Baghdad Bob Besser, son of Satan, father of lies,
[03:04:43.240 --> 03:04:50.240]  fraudster, scumbag, piece of trash, deceiver of humanity, for telling super whopper lies.
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:56.240]  I personally think his minions tell even bigger ones, but whatever. You voted, it's your vote.
[03:04:56.240 --> 03:05:06.240]  Obama wins the coveted Baghdad Bob Fraudster Award.
