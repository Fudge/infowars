[00:00.000 --> 00:09.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is September 22, 2016, on this Thursday edition, 46 days out
[00:09.900 --> 00:14.520]  from the most historic election in U.S. history, perhaps, world history.
[00:14.520 --> 00:20.000]  Soros and the Globalists are activating race-war destabilization programs across the country
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.760]  and the world.
[00:21.760 --> 00:26.640]  We have massive other developments, and Hillary now had a psychotic breakdown in a video
[00:26.640 --> 00:28.000]  link to supporters.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  It's all unraveling, but first, a report on Hillary.
[00:31.000 --> 00:34.000]  Who voted for your party's nominee, Governor?
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.000]  I am.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.800]  I am proud of Hillary Clinton.
[00:36.800 --> 00:41.000]  I think she's been a very good Secretary of State, a very good Senator from the State
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.000]  of New York.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.200]  The thing I like most about her is I believe that she is steady.
[00:45.200 --> 00:47.000]  I believe that she is strong.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  I believe that she is honest, and I look forward to voting for her.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  Her speeches are so short, though.
[00:53.000 --> 00:54.000]  They don't last long.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  You know, they're like, 10 minutes, let's get out of here.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  Go back home and go to sleep.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  While Hillary slept, the sleeping giant was wakening.
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  Presenting himself in a downpour in front of a hearty crowd of Trump supporters in historic
[01:09.000 --> 01:15.000]  Williamsburg, Virginia, Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Mike Pence delivered a rousing patriotic
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.000]  speech.
[01:16.000 --> 01:24.000]  You know, it's not just weakness on the world stage, but Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  are all wet on the economy, too.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.300]  And the truth is, men and women, as we stand here in Virginia, we hear sunny stories all
[01:34.300 --> 01:38.000]  the time coming from the other side about how good things are.
[01:38.000 --> 01:43.000]  But the truth of the matter is, the American people know different.
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  We're in the midst of the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  We're in the midst of an economy that has the lowest labor participation rate since
[01:55.000 --> 01:56.000]  the 1970s.
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  And today, in this economy, there are nearly 7 million more Americans living in poverty
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  than the day that Barack Obama became President of the United States.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  Hillary Clinton's solution is very simple.
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  More are the same.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.000]  More taxes.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  More regulation.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  More Obamacare.
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  And more of the war on cold has been stifling American jobs and the American economy.
[02:24.000 --> 02:35.000]  Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine was catering to an entirely different audience.
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  Kaine was much of Spanish-speaking skills he had utilized back in the 1980s when Kaine
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  traveled to Honduras to cut his teeth on the wielding of Marxist-based liberation theology.
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000]  The Hill wrote, reports indicate that in Honduras, Mr. Kaine embraced an interpretation of the
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  Gospel known as liberation theology.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  This wasn't mainstream Catholic thought at the time.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  It was a radical Marxist-based ideology at odds with the church, the Pope, and the United
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  States, but supportive of and supported by the Soviet Union.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  Pence and Kaine will face off in a vice presidential debate on Tuesday, October 4th.
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  Do you feel bad for Mike Pence that he has to defend?
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  Because he's got to be constantly like, oh no, what do I say now?
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  What did he say now?
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  It is part of the role.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  I don't find that a heavy lift at all to do the work I have to do to tell people Hillary's story.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  Meanwhile, Tim Kaine, Chelsea Clinton, and Bill Clinton all fill in for a clearly sick Hillary
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  who managed to schedule a rally in Orlando, Florida at the last minute after being heavily
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  criticized for her absence to the campaign trail before the big showdown between Hillary
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  and Donald on Monday, September 26th.
[03:48.000 --> 03:57.000]  Three days later, she gets up and she does another one and goes back home and goes to sleep.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  Oh boy, as ice is hoping for her.
[04:00.000 --> 04:06.000]  Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump continues to steam through Toledo,
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  Ohio, Chester Township, Pennsylvania, and Roanoke, Virginia before the big event.
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  A conservative leader wrote the Gateway Pundit Wednesday morning to share this news.
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  Hearing smart guys say that Hillary may cancel the debate on Monday.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  Hillary may be trying to run out the clock because she thinks she is ahead or she may be exhausted
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  and scared of another physical emergency.
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  If Hillary manages to not cancel Monday's debate, she now has a full four days off to set up a defense
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  for the onslaught of questions she will have to answer to concerning her long criminal history.
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  I mean, many of the national media spend more time talking about what Donald Trump said in the last 30 minutes
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  than they do talking about what the Clintons have been up to for the last 30 years,
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  but the American people are on to them.
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  John Barrow for Infowars.com.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Hillary Clinton is breaking down video straight ahead.
[04:59.000 --> 05:04.000]  Billionaire George Soros has given yet another massive lump sum to Hillary Clinton.
[05:04.000 --> 05:11.000]  The Hill reports he gave $2.5 million to a pro-Clinton PAC and a final desperate push weeks before the national election.
[05:11.000 --> 05:18.000]  Soros joins a chorus of hedge fund moguls that are pouring stunning amounts of cash into the main super PAC supporting Clinton's campaign.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  Hedge funders like Donald Sussman, a liberal financier that's New York City based,
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  he's given at least $10.5 million along with George Soros to Priorities USA.
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.000]  Priorities USA is the group that has unreserved more than $150 million in advertising cash to help Clinton win the election.
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  This news comes as the Clinton Foundation is planning to drop dozens of employees like flies from its payroll,
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  saying that they're closing many of its operations.
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  Politico reports that two former Clinton Foundation officials will remain on their communication staff.
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  The Clintons are shutting down their controversial cartel and severing many of its personal ties,
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  still using primary donors like Soros to continue funding Clinton.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  Through the best job you can to purify your air, the elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[06:32.000 --> 06:37.000]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  The general public doesn't.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[06:47.000 --> 06:54.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  Secret 12 has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[07:27.000 --> 07:34.000]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  No needles, no injections.
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.000]  Don't take my word for it.
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  Try it for yourself.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.000]  Discover the secret.

[08:00.000 --> 08:01.000]  You've got it.
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  That Christmas is coming to you.
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  All right, you want to go?
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  We see the earth.
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  You've got it.
[08:25.000 --> 08:31.000]  Obama's legacy is going to be the rise of nationalism.
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  Angela Merkel's legacy will be the rise of nationalism.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  And all these other minions of this planetary corporate takeover, that is their legacy is
[08:42.000 --> 08:51.000]  reawakening the sleeping giant that is free humanity and the nation state.
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.000]  We certainly know that governments constituted by men always become corrupt over time and
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.000]  have their problems.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  And there's a balance between government and free individual rights.
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  And I personally want to have the very smallest, most limited government possible.
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.000]  But only an incredibly moral people could be truly in an anarchy based system.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  And that doesn't exist.
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  And as we become more and more corrupt, more and more evil, more and more decant, more
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  and more disconnected, more and more entitled, by extension that will manifest a bigger and
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  bigger government to control the population.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  And that bigger and bigger government will become more and more corrupt itself, accelerating
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  us into a cycle of collapse and we are undoubtedly entering the very depths of that right now.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  We are entering the gates of hell.
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.000]  The roller coaster is going over the edge right now and getting ready to do the loop
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  to loop.
[09:49.000 --> 09:59.000]  The up to the top just stopped and things are about to get crazy.
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  In fact, they're already getting crazy, obviously.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.000]  Wow.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  Hillary Clinton, Washington Post is reporting.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  Drugreport.com hasn't linked centrally up on the page.
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.000]  Hillary Clinton is acting more and more quirky, more and more insane, more and more like she's
[10:20.000 --> 10:27.000]  having many seizures, bugging her eyes out and saying, using improper English, coming
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  out and saying, why aren't I 50 points ahead?
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.000]  And when you look at the video of the Secret Service agent running up beside her and saying,
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  it's okay.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  It's okay.
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.000]  Keep going.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  Keep going.
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  You see her losing reality, losing the connection with reality and then suddenly flashing back
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  into it.
[10:51.000 --> 10:57.000]  I, unfortunately, in my life had to deal with someone who was later diagnosed as being psychotic.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  And they would go into the exact same thing that I see with Hillary Clinton.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  And those of us that have had to be around this and it's personal and private and I'm
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  not going to get into it, understand what it looks like when somebody's eyes completely
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  go into like saucers and they usually make this little weird smile and you're like,
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  uh-oh, they're gone.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  Somebody else is here.
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.560]  Let me tell you, Hillary Clinton is fluxing in and out.
[11:23.560 --> 11:26.720]  All of us do this when we get really angry and blow up.
[11:26.720 --> 11:30.920]  I mean, we're designed to do that to be able to get upset and motivated.
[11:30.920 --> 11:35.140]  All of us have little psychotic breaks when, you know, you see somebody, let's say punch
[11:35.140 --> 11:38.400]  your kid in the face, you're going to have a break because you're going to have the
[11:38.400 --> 11:42.160]  normal instincts to defend your young.
[11:42.160 --> 11:48.440]  But when you become, you know, truly psychopathic with massive psychoses, it's when your false
[11:48.440 --> 11:52.840]  world becomes basically the real world to you.
[11:52.840 --> 11:59.560]  And more and more, you check out of the real world and retreat and recede into La La Land.
[11:59.560 --> 12:05.720]  Now that's a lay analysis of a psychotic breaks and people that are in deep psychosis, but
[12:05.720 --> 12:06.720]  it exists.
[12:06.720 --> 12:07.720]  It's real.
[12:07.720 --> 12:08.720]  We've all seen it.
[12:08.720 --> 12:11.360]  We've all experienced it in our lives.
[12:11.360 --> 12:14.280]  Because it's mild.
[12:14.280 --> 12:18.640]  Sometimes someone thinks that they're God or invincible or that demons are coming after
[12:18.640 --> 12:19.640]  them.
[12:19.640 --> 12:25.000]  But more often than not, in the power elite, they become megalomaniacal and very, very
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.600]  angry and very, very entitled.
[12:27.600 --> 12:31.720]  And when someone challenges them or they're not being given what they want, they blow
[12:31.720 --> 12:35.760]  up and throw a big temper tantrum like a three year old.
[12:35.760 --> 12:39.960]  Just like what we're seeing in North Carolina, Joe Biggs is on his way there right now.
[12:39.960 --> 12:43.400]  He had hoped that this would cool down, so I didn't really talk about it a lot yesterday.
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.440]  It's a total George Soros operation on paper.
[12:46.440 --> 12:47.440]  I mean, that's admitted.
[12:47.440 --> 12:48.440]  I'm not just saying that.
[12:48.440 --> 12:49.440]  Everybody knows that.
[12:49.440 --> 12:58.400]  He just gave them another 500 million to the overall destabilization of the borders.
[12:58.400 --> 13:01.240]  Ford Foundation has given him 100 million directly to Black Lives Matter.
[13:01.240 --> 13:05.560]  I mean, this is the foundations that run our country trying to destabilize us.
[13:05.560 --> 13:13.040]  And notice that they didn't pick the poor crutcher guy shot by the Lady Cop in Tulsa with his
[13:13.040 --> 13:21.240]  car broke down, put his hands up like she said, then she executed him.
[13:21.240 --> 13:22.960]  Donald Trump's come out and said, the lady choked.
[13:22.960 --> 13:24.560]  She shouldn't be on the force.
[13:24.560 --> 13:26.360]  She's clearly got problems.
[13:26.360 --> 13:28.680]  Exact same thing I said two days ago and yesterday.
[13:28.680 --> 13:29.840]  Trump didn't get that from me.
[13:29.840 --> 13:30.840]  That's what's happening.
[13:30.840 --> 13:33.920]  That cop didn't want to kill him because he was black.
[13:33.920 --> 13:37.480]  That cop killed him because she was panicked and scared and there's all this hype about
[13:37.480 --> 13:40.960]  how the black people are going to, you know, kill the cops because you got Soros groups
[13:40.960 --> 13:44.760]  pushing that narrative that she shouldn't be in that position.
[13:44.760 --> 13:45.880]  She can't handle the stress.
[13:45.880 --> 13:46.880]  She killed him.
[13:46.880 --> 13:49.880]  She should be charged with manslaughter.
[13:49.880 --> 13:50.880]  I'm sorry.
[13:50.880 --> 13:51.880]  Just looking at it.
[13:51.880 --> 13:53.080]  The guy followed the orders.
[13:53.080 --> 13:54.240]  His car was broke down.
[13:54.240 --> 13:56.680]  She killed him.
[13:56.680 --> 13:57.680]  And Trump has come out.
[13:57.680 --> 14:01.080]  We're going to play the clip later and said he's very troubled by Oklahoma fatal police
[14:01.080 --> 14:07.920]  shooting and said, look, the woman clearly choked.
[14:07.920 --> 14:10.160]  She melted down.
[14:10.160 --> 14:12.560]  She couldn't handle it.
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.720]  And that's the type of cops we actually have out there shooting innocent people is people
[14:16.720 --> 14:21.520]  choking.
[14:21.520 --> 14:22.520]  And I'm sorry.
[14:22.520 --> 14:23.520]  You asked for the hard job.
[14:23.520 --> 14:24.520]  It's a rough job.
[14:24.520 --> 14:29.680]  I try to back good police in general, but you cannot let cops get off that basically
[14:29.680 --> 14:33.760]  execute people through through cowardice, whatever you want to call it.
[14:33.760 --> 14:37.920]  But notice that's not being turned into the big cause to live.
[14:37.920 --> 14:41.120]  Whether it was the shooting in Ferguson or shootings in other areas or this new one in
[14:41.120 --> 14:43.200]  North Carolina in Charlotte.
[14:43.200 --> 14:44.600]  It wasn't a book in his hand.
[14:44.600 --> 14:45.600]  The video's out.
[14:45.600 --> 14:46.600]  It's on him.
[14:46.600 --> 14:47.600]  Full wars.com.
[14:47.600 --> 14:48.600]  It's a gun.
[14:48.600 --> 14:49.920]  The cops are saying, let go of it.
[14:49.920 --> 14:52.840]  He won't let go of it.
[14:52.840 --> 14:54.720]  There's a guy with a gun in his hand won't let go of it.
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.000]  They got his hand pinned down, had to shooting.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.240]  Black cop shot him, by the way.
[15:00.240 --> 15:02.040]  Black guy shoots a black guy.
[15:02.040 --> 15:03.240]  It's white people's fault.
[15:03.240 --> 15:05.760]  There are white trendies out there.
[15:05.760 --> 15:07.040]  There's Paul Watson wrote about it.
[15:07.040 --> 15:08.800]  It's up on info wars.com.
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.320]  He tweeted and made the point.
[15:13.320 --> 15:16.560]  Black man has a gun shot by a black cop.
[15:16.560 --> 15:18.920]  It's white people's fault.
[15:18.920 --> 15:24.840]  Black protester rioter shoots another black protester rioter and it's white people's fault.
[15:24.840 --> 15:31.240]  No, you got a white woman shooting a black father of what, four or five kids with no
[15:31.240 --> 15:35.200]  criminal record on his way back from church, I was told.
[15:35.200 --> 15:39.960]  His car breaks down, cops pull up, they see a big black guy, woman gets scared, the guy's
[15:39.960 --> 15:43.800]  like, okay, I'll do what you say and she kills him.
[15:43.800 --> 15:48.080]  But not because she was probably racist, but because she shouldn't have that job and she
[15:48.080 --> 15:50.600]  choked and Donald Trump gets it exactly right.
[15:50.600 --> 15:53.760]  I said two days ago, she choked.
[15:53.760 --> 15:56.360]  I said yesterday, she can't handle it.
[15:56.360 --> 15:57.360]  She freaked out.
[15:57.360 --> 15:59.120]  I didn't use the word he used choked.
[15:59.120 --> 16:01.360]  That's what's great about Trump.
[16:01.360 --> 16:02.360]  He gets it.
[16:02.360 --> 16:03.360]  He's smart.
[16:03.360 --> 16:04.840]  He understands what's going on.
[16:04.840 --> 16:11.840]  But this situation in North Carolina is like the Gaza Strip now, army, Humvees, white people
[16:11.840 --> 16:16.200]  begging for their lives being beaten, white people having their apartments broken into
[16:16.200 --> 16:22.120]  begging, white people being targeted, white reporters being targeted by racist mobs of
[16:22.120 --> 16:27.520]  black Ku Klux Klan enabled by the media and the culture.
[16:27.520 --> 16:31.920]  We have family members of the black guy that got shot by a black cop saying white people
[16:31.920 --> 16:40.240]  and the quote right here, Keith Lamont's brother, Keith Lamont Scott's brother calls
[16:40.240 --> 16:44.240]  all white people devils and then there's always a little sycophantic white people running
[16:44.240 --> 16:45.240]  around behind.
[16:45.240 --> 16:46.240]  I'm sorry.
[16:46.240 --> 16:47.240]  I'm evil.
[16:47.240 --> 16:48.240]  I'm evil.
[16:48.240 --> 16:49.240]  I have a sign.
[16:49.240 --> 16:50.240]  Whites are evil.
[16:50.240 --> 16:51.240]  I mean, I saw the signs.
[16:51.240 --> 16:56.600]  We're going to continue to have these problems or, you know, white corruption is the cause.
[16:56.600 --> 17:02.840]  I mean, that's all these signs by weirdo white people out there when it's a black cop shooting
[17:02.840 --> 17:08.960]  a black guy with a gun in the middle of the street.
[17:08.960 --> 17:19.200]  Again, this is all outside organized, outside coordinated, outside manipulated to become
[17:19.200 --> 17:23.280]  the urban culture, whether you're black, white, it doesn't matter where you're a victim.
[17:23.280 --> 17:28.840]  Everyone's out to get you, but the local democratic governments, your friend against
[17:28.840 --> 17:33.680]  their own very police because they're busy bringing the UN in under strong cities to
[17:33.680 --> 17:37.680]  federalize them.
[17:37.680 --> 17:40.640]  Doesn't matter if your unemployment is doubled, it doesn't matter if your society's falling
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.120]  apart, doesn't matter if your jobs have been shipped overseas.
[17:44.120 --> 17:53.080]  It doesn't matter because we've created the perception that there's this epidemic of
[17:53.080 --> 17:58.080]  police going after black people to kill them.
[17:58.080 --> 18:01.280]  The truth is that's not happening.
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.160]  The truth is the drug laws have been written to put a predominantly large number of black
[18:05.160 --> 18:11.720]  people in prison and blacks have been targeted with secret biological testing and abortion
[18:11.720 --> 18:16.200]  and with less funding to the schools and with allowing red light districts in their neighborhoods
[18:16.200 --> 18:17.200]  but nobody else's.
[18:17.200 --> 18:19.920]  Oh, the truth is, there's a conspiracy against black Americans.
[18:19.920 --> 18:29.360]  You better absolutely know it's been declassified, but nobody wants to actually look at that.
[18:29.360 --> 18:32.920]  More and more black leaders actually are that aren't on the globalist payroll of the Ford
[18:32.920 --> 18:41.440]  Foundation and Margaret Sanger and the usual suspects who admit in their founding charters
[18:41.440 --> 18:46.200]  we are being set up to become the liberals, to make black people trust us, to buy off
[18:46.200 --> 18:49.600]  their leaders so we can kill these weeds.
[18:49.600 --> 18:53.280]  Margaret Sanger quote, look it up, it's mainstream news.
[18:53.280 --> 18:56.000]  Woman of the Year in Time magazine, I think three times.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.100]  Even recently they gave it to her like a decade ago.
[18:58.100 --> 19:05.120]  The woman was worshipped, I'm skipping this break, by Adolf Hitler.
[19:05.120 --> 19:07.160]  Was given awards by Hitler.
[19:07.160 --> 19:08.680]  She gave awards to Hitler.
[19:08.680 --> 19:13.040]  This is in the nineteen late thirties.
[19:13.040 --> 19:14.720]  You say literally Hitler?
[19:14.720 --> 19:15.720]  She's it.
[19:15.720 --> 19:23.720]  Oh, but let's call Donald Trump literally Hitler when there's zero connection.
[19:23.720 --> 19:28.160]  So I can tell you, we're going to break all this down today.
[19:28.160 --> 19:33.400]  We've got big guests coming up as well, former technical director of the National Security
[19:33.400 --> 19:44.520]  Agency who is portrayed in the new Snowden movie will be joining us to give us his take
[19:44.520 --> 19:52.040]  on Snowden and then we're also going to have former NSA officer and infowars.com reporter
[19:52.040 --> 19:56.400]  Wayne Madsen on the transmission while Benny's on with me because he can ask even more expert
[19:56.400 --> 19:57.400]  questions.
[19:57.400 --> 20:08.000]  But it's really interesting to see the truth come out in that movie, it blew me away.
[20:08.000 --> 20:11.040]  So we're going to get into it because I know some of the things that are in the movie actually
[20:11.040 --> 20:15.640]  haven't been declassified and that's what really freaked me out and Benny doesn't want
[20:15.640 --> 20:21.360]  to be swat teamed as he's been swat teamed before for even reporting to Congress under
[20:21.360 --> 20:28.960]  law what he was going on, but it was very, very interesting to see the film and I really
[20:28.960 --> 20:29.960]  want to promote it.
[20:29.960 --> 20:31.800]  I have no financial connection to it.
[20:31.800 --> 20:37.480]  I'm just very, very, very proud of the fact that the information is truly powerful and
[20:37.480 --> 20:44.440]  we'll get it to a general public.
[20:44.440 --> 20:53.000]  But again, to see Nicholas Cage playing William Benny was amazing.
[20:53.000 --> 20:59.320]  So that's all, all coming up in the second hour and we'll also continue this discussion
[20:59.320 --> 21:04.320]  of what's happening in Charlotte, North Carolina into the third and fourth hour today.
[21:04.320 --> 21:11.440]  Anthony Uchiarty is hosting the fourth hour before I go any further though, let's just
[21:11.440 --> 21:15.960]  read some of the headlines and then I'll get into Hillary's latest, latest break with
[21:15.960 --> 21:16.960]  reality.
[21:16.960 --> 21:20.440]  Let's read some of the headlines from DrudgeReport.com.
[21:20.440 --> 21:27.680]  Thugs of Charlotte, white man dragged, beaten, begged for mercy.
[21:27.680 --> 21:34.020]  Second night of chaos, violence, appeals for calm, state of emergency, protesters smashing
[21:34.020 --> 21:35.680]  apartment windows on live TV.
[21:35.680 --> 21:38.880]  No, they're looters, they're rioters.
[21:38.880 --> 21:48.200]  NASCAR Hall of Fame looted, homeless, white man kicked over, rioters go shoe shopping
[21:48.200 --> 21:56.560]  for size, stolen cash register, attempt to throw a photographer into fire, victim's
[21:56.560 --> 22:02.560]  brother calls all white people devils, CNN reporter attacked, white man with guns, allowed
[22:02.560 --> 22:04.920]  to drive away alive.
[22:04.920 --> 22:09.640]  And that's the point is to drive through the rioting to say, here's my gun, which is a
[22:09.640 --> 22:10.640]  good message.
[22:10.640 --> 22:13.280]  I mean, I can't imagine, I don't care if a group of white people, white people, you're
[22:13.280 --> 22:16.640]  rioting, I'm with my family, you're trying to block my car and drag me out.
[22:16.640 --> 22:22.080]  I mean, you're going to get aired out real quick.
[22:22.080 --> 22:26.960]  It's so sad, but it's really, really getting pushed folks.
[22:26.960 --> 22:27.960]  Very, very sad.
[22:27.960 --> 22:31.480]  There's a lot of new polls out, we're going to be going over, they're up on info wars.com
[22:31.480 --> 22:38.000]  and on drugsreport.com, whether it's Rasmussen or Washington Post polls or other scientific
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.960]  polls being conducted by the LA Times.
[22:39.960 --> 22:47.400]  He is five to 10 points ahead and surging the wave, the Trump wave, the Americana wave
[22:47.400 --> 22:50.680]  is turning into a tsunami.
[22:50.680 --> 22:55.240]  So we'll be looking at all of that obviously and talking about what will the October surprise
[22:55.240 --> 22:57.360]  of hair Hillary beat.
[22:57.360 --> 23:01.640]  By the way, Joel Gilbert is giving us the exclusive because he's working with members
[23:01.640 --> 23:08.240]  of the Obama family, the cut out family from Kenya, they're not really his family and they
[23:08.240 --> 23:10.360]  know that now.
[23:10.360 --> 23:13.600]  They are giving us the exclusive tomorrow.
[23:13.600 --> 23:19.880]  You will see the exclusive tomorrow with Joel Gilbert of Obama two decades ago talking
[23:19.880 --> 23:24.960]  absolute total trash about America and saying how much he hates white people.
[23:24.960 --> 23:30.800]  This is dangerous, this is extremely powerful and let me tell you, I'm crossing my fingers
[23:30.800 --> 23:34.480]  this even gets on air tomorrow because it's bad.
[23:34.480 --> 23:38.720]  It's going to be huge, it's going to be massive news making and I appreciate Joel Gilbert
[23:38.720 --> 23:45.040]  sharing this great honor, this great danger with us but this will premiere tomorrow, was
[23:45.040 --> 23:53.040]  that the third hour on the Friday, Friday edition so be sure and join us for that.
[23:53.040 --> 23:58.520]  Okay, I'm going to put a special report together on this today because it's so important, it
[23:58.520 --> 24:00.360]  needs to go mega viral.
[24:00.360 --> 24:06.400]  We have Hillary Clinton with the shadowy gentleman who they wouldn't say who he was,
[24:06.400 --> 24:11.240]  a medical doctor, secret service shadowing her with the EpiPen a few weeks ago, runs
[24:11.240 --> 24:16.040]  up the side and says it's okay, it's okay, go back, everything's okay, keep talking.
[24:16.040 --> 24:24.440]  You can clearly see Hillary goes out of consciousness to, has had a psychotic break, it's classic,
[24:24.440 --> 24:30.120]  you can see it, psychiatrists that have seen it, Dr. Pachennick say clearly she is going
[24:30.120 --> 24:35.040]  into Lollaland, then her handler there, it tells her it's okay, it's okay and she flips
[24:35.040 --> 24:41.320]  right back into reality, okay and there's so many of these videos now and she'll be
[24:41.320 --> 24:46.720]  on other shows and people are asking her questions like that veteran did a few weeks ago saying
[24:46.720 --> 24:50.000]  hey I was a Navy veteran, if I did anything you did with secret classified info, I'd
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.560]  be in prison and she kind of goes from looking nice to instantly raring forward and General
[24:55.560 --> 25:02.760]  Flynn introduced Donald Trump at the Congressional Medal of Honor's winner event that was endorsing
[25:02.760 --> 25:06.160]  Trump last week, made the point, we're going to play that in a few minutes, after we play
[25:06.160 --> 25:11.840]  the new Hillary clip that this is dangerous, this is someone going in and out of reality,
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.320]  this is someone that has huge anger management problems and does not need to be president
[25:16.320 --> 25:20.280]  of the United States and she's losing her cognitive ability and General Flynn is one
[25:20.280 --> 25:24.360]  of the top generals ever in intelligence, reorganizing the military, just did wonders
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.320]  for special forces, I mean he's a generals general, there are a lot of generals and a
[25:28.320 --> 25:31.640]  lot of them just kind of sit around here, yes man, Flynn is as good as he gets, the
[25:31.640 --> 25:36.800]  guy that exposed Hillary and Obama basically running al-Qaeda and ISIS and the soft coup
[25:36.800 --> 25:41.440]  against them to not back al-Qaeda and ISIS in the full takeover of the Middle East and
[25:41.440 --> 25:46.720]  many areas of Africa and of course you heard that here four and a half years ago, Sy Hersh
[25:46.720 --> 25:50.360]  came on earlier this year to tip his hat and say yes, you did basically break that and
[25:50.360 --> 25:53.400]  this is all true and it's happened, just so, there you go, that's Sy Hersh, Pulitzer Prize
[25:53.400 --> 25:58.440]  winner concurring with our analysis, so we're going to have the former leader of the, I
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.560]  meant what you call it, the leader, the guy that actually ran the NSA, not the politician
[26:02.560 --> 26:05.520]  that sits on top of, but the guy that headed the NSA is coming on, I mean that's the type
[26:05.520 --> 26:10.480]  of guest we have, okay, I mean this is trailblazing, I'm not bragging, I just want listeners
[26:10.480 --> 26:15.280]  to know, we're not putting shop liver out here, this is not BS, I mean we're going to
[26:15.280 --> 26:20.520]  play exclusive Obama saying he hates America tomorrow and basically hates white people,
[26:20.520 --> 26:24.680]  okay, like I don't even want to wait till tomorrow, this is so dangerous, we should
[26:24.680 --> 26:29.840]  probably get him on the day and release it, but just whatever, I don't usually get butterflies
[26:29.840 --> 26:35.720]  but the world is quickening so fast, I've got him all the time now, okay, so we've got
[26:35.720 --> 26:39.720]  all this unfolding, all this happening and you've got her collapsing and the media covering
[26:39.720 --> 26:44.280]  it up and only showing her beginning the seizure and you've got all of her anger issues, the
[26:44.280 --> 26:50.120]  secret services told us about on air and all the other points you can add to this and now
[26:50.120 --> 26:54.880]  you've got the Washington Post saying Clinton asked why she isn't beating Trump by 50 points,
[26:54.880 --> 27:01.000]  no, the headline should be Hillary appears to lose it for a few seconds, looks completely
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.880]  crazy and then doesn't use proper English and she does this sometimes, why aren't I
[27:06.880 --> 27:14.440]  50 points ahead, why aren't I, so we're going to play that video right now, obviously this
[27:14.440 --> 27:20.120]  is not as powerful for radio listeners, TV viewers, infowars.com forward slash show, you'll
[27:20.120 --> 27:24.720]  be able to see it but it's posted on infowars.com, it's posted on drudgerport.com, from the
[27:24.720 --> 27:29.640]  Washington Post, everybody needs to look at this but by itself it's like okay big deal
[27:29.640 --> 27:35.840]  but you add it in context to all the other weirdness, she's a charity, quickly here's
[27:35.840 --> 27:44.680]  the clip and I will fight back against so-called right to work, right to work is wrong for
[27:44.680 --> 27:51.160]  workers and wrong for America, now having said all this why aren't I 50 points ahead
[27:51.160 --> 27:58.000]  you might ask, well the choice for working families has never been clearer, I need your
[27:58.000 --> 28:06.480]  help to get Donald Trump's record out to everybody, nobody should be fooled, he proudly declared
[28:06.480 --> 28:15.080]  himself 100% right to work, he even hired a union busting firm to break up an organizing
[28:15.080 --> 28:22.720]  campaign at his hotel in Las Vegas where you are right now and he built up his wealth by
[28:22.720 --> 28:28.800]  stiffing small businesses and contractors, that goes against everything we stand for
[28:28.800 --> 28:33.320]  as a country, my dad was a small business, I'm just businessman, I'm just happy he never
[28:33.320 --> 28:36.200]  did business with Trump.
[28:36.200 --> 28:41.520]  Hillary's like a different person every time she speaks now, she's clearly drugged up,
[28:41.520 --> 28:47.720]  she clearly looks like a puppet, when you watch the video she's a charity quickly but
[28:47.720 --> 28:51.120]  we're gonna add it together with a bunch of other videos in the next hour and put out
[28:51.120 --> 28:55.040]  something that really shows you a compilation of what's happening that makes it even clearer,
[28:55.040 --> 28:58.360]  but right now as we go out to break, here's General Flynn talking about how dangerous
[28:58.360 --> 28:59.360]  she is last week.
[28:59.360 --> 29:04.960]  If there was a temperament problem for anybody who watched the Commander in Chief's Town
[29:04.960 --> 29:10.920]  Hall a week or so ago, now you saw the temperament rise up in Hillary Clinton and you saw her
[29:10.920 --> 29:16.680]  when she stood up on the stage there to argue with the individual, the gentleman that asked
[29:16.680 --> 29:21.360]  the question was out of the Navy or Navy National, now it's a tough question, tough question
[29:21.360 --> 29:26.720]  and she lost her temper, she lost her temper and that's something that I think...
[29:26.720 --> 29:30.320]  Something he goes on to say, we don't need as a Commander in Chief and control during
[29:30.320 --> 29:33.240]  serious crises with nuclear weapons, so we come back we're gonna play the full clip for
[29:33.240 --> 29:38.600]  folks and we also have other clips of her and we're gonna have the clip of the Navy
[29:38.600 --> 29:44.600]  Veteran asking the question and more, all this and a ton of other key intel straight
[29:44.600 --> 29:50.880]  ahead today and then inside the NSA, secrets that nobody else has ever revealed.
[29:50.880 --> 30:00.640]  The Empires on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.640 --> 30:04.720]  Capitol Hill lawmakers are horn-locked in a bitter battle this week, one side trying
[30:04.720 --> 30:10.800]  to block President Obama's bid to sell 1.15 billion in U.S. arms to Saudi Arabia.
[30:10.800 --> 30:14.880]  The massive sale of tanks, guns and other military equipment to the Saudis has driven
[30:14.880 --> 30:17.040]  a wedge among U.S. lawmakers.
[30:17.040 --> 30:21.240]  Some on the Hill calling Rydia a good ally while others saying its occupation of Yemen
[30:21.240 --> 30:24.120]  is most assuredly where these weapons will be used.
[30:24.120 --> 30:28.640]  We know the Saudis hit Yemeni hospitals, schools and other civilian targets.
[30:28.640 --> 30:33.080]  Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky said he pushed to end the U.S. assistance to Saudi Arabia
[30:33.080 --> 30:34.400]  in the war in Yemen.
[30:34.400 --> 30:38.560]  Paul says, quote, this is part of a larger effort by many of us to say that Congress
[30:38.560 --> 30:43.320]  is not only relevant but has the primary role and duty of the initiation of war.
[30:43.320 --> 30:46.920]  All of this while the president is preaching, quote, tough love to the Saudis.
[30:46.920 --> 30:49.800]  This tough love doesn't include deals like this, of course.
[30:49.800 --> 30:54.800]  Obama has sold more advanced weaponry to Saudi leaders than any of his predecessors despite
[30:54.800 --> 30:56.760]  their atrocious human rights record.
[30:56.760 --> 31:00.200]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.
[31:00.200 --> 31:03.400]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[32:00.200 --> 32:05.640]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[32:05.640 --> 32:06.640]  produce.
[32:06.640 --> 32:09.920]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[32:09.920 --> 32:13.360]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[32:13.360 --> 32:15.560]  it's very, very important.
[32:15.560 --> 32:22.200]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[32:22.200 --> 32:24.480]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[32:24.480 --> 32:26.560]  Now when it runs out, you start dying.
[32:26.560 --> 32:30.940]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[32:30.940 --> 32:33.800]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[32:33.800 --> 32:35.480]  It works like an antioxidant.
[32:35.480 --> 32:38.320]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[32:38.320 --> 32:41.560]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[32:41.560 --> 32:42.600]  It's in powder form.

[33:08.760 --> 33:12.160]  Fortune favors the bold.
[33:12.160 --> 33:13.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:13.160 --> 33:14.160]  When I was young, I was the nicest guy I knew.
[33:14.160 --> 33:15.160]  I thought I was the truth.
[33:15.160 --> 33:20.160]  When I was young, I was the nicest guy I knew.
[33:20.160 --> 33:25.160]  I thought I was the chosen one.
[33:25.160 --> 33:33.160]  But time went by and I found out a thing or two.
[33:33.160 --> 33:40.160]  My shine wore off as time wore on.
[33:40.160 --> 33:45.160]  I thought that I was living out the perfect life.
[33:45.160 --> 33:48.160]  Well, I tell you, my head is just spinning and sometimes I cross wires.
[33:48.160 --> 33:53.160]  I know Joel Gilbert's been working to release info from the Obama family in Kenya with us.
[33:53.160 --> 33:55.160]  He's got some other stuff he's releasing tomorrow.
[33:55.160 --> 34:00.160]  Then I've got Paul working with others and people connected to the family.
[34:00.160 --> 34:04.160]  With other video we have that we're going to be putting out soon.
[34:04.160 --> 34:10.160]  As soon as we're authorized to, Obama talking about how bad white people are and how much he hates America, basically.
[34:10.160 --> 34:11.160]  All of those are going on.
[34:11.160 --> 34:14.160]  Gilbert's on on a similar subject, but in another area tomorrow.
[34:14.160 --> 34:16.160]  He has released information from the family before.
[34:16.160 --> 34:21.160]  So that's how I was mixing those two together because the two articles came out basically together.
[34:21.160 --> 34:24.160]  So that's how much intel is pouring in here.
[34:24.160 --> 34:30.160]  It really becomes dizzying.
[34:30.160 --> 34:32.160]  Dizzying is a word for it.
[34:32.160 --> 34:33.160]  I mean, look at this.
[34:33.160 --> 34:34.160]  This has gotten no attention.
[34:34.160 --> 34:37.160]  And I've got hundreds of articles, just as insane.
[34:37.160 --> 34:42.160]  Julian Assange says he'll turn himself in if Obama pardons Chelsea Manning.
[34:42.160 --> 34:47.160]  Because Chelsea Manning was one of the main people that gave him these documents.
[34:47.160 --> 34:55.160]  WikiLeaks tweets offers one day before a Swedish appeals court upholds warrant for Assange arrest.
[34:55.160 --> 34:59.160]  Then we've got this bizarreness we're going to play later.
[34:59.160 --> 35:01.160]  It's up on infowars.com.
[35:01.160 --> 35:05.160]  Bizarre message plays on hacked radio station.
[35:05.160 --> 35:10.160]  Trump will go 26th, a Paul Watson article.
[35:10.160 --> 35:14.160]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[35:14.160 --> 35:22.160]  The article that I was mixing together with Gilbert's info is leaked video shows Obama railing against white people during Kenya trip.
[35:22.160 --> 35:25.160]  So again, that's coming soon.
[35:25.160 --> 35:28.160]  Oh my gosh, it's amazing.
[35:28.160 --> 35:33.160]  Then of course we've got the whole situation in North Carolina and Charlotte.
[35:33.160 --> 35:37.160]  We've got an article that's very important media prepares for Hillary defeat.
[35:37.160 --> 35:41.160]  Now mainstream media is saying, hey, we better actually get ready to deal with this.
[35:41.160 --> 35:48.160]  The left is reportedly even Politico reporting panicking and saying, what's wrong with Hillary? Where is she?
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.160]  Now she's not doing any public events. She's not talking to press.
[35:52.160 --> 36:00.160]  She will basically show up and talk to people via satellite or Skype.
[36:00.160 --> 36:04.160]  And even then she seems wooden. She seems angry.
[36:04.160 --> 36:09.160]  She seems robotic. And her eyes look completely insane.
[36:09.160 --> 36:16.160]  And we've always seen different Hillary's, but this is getting downright weird.
[36:16.160 --> 36:24.160]  Downright bizarre. Speaking of downright bizarre, Obama set to veto 911 victims bid to sue the Saudis.
[36:24.160 --> 36:27.160]  15 of the 19 hijackers came from there.
[36:27.160 --> 36:38.160]  I mean, I don't know. And I knew back at the time and had guests on like Mr. Springman, who headed up the embassy visa section, that they were ordered to let them in saying, quote, they work for the CIA.
[36:38.160 --> 36:41.160]  Even though they were listed as terrorists in the watch list.
[36:41.160 --> 36:43.160]  We're told we have to have all this new NSA spying.
[36:43.160 --> 36:46.160]  But then even when they're on the terror watch list, they're told, go ahead and let them in.
[36:46.160 --> 36:55.160]  Just like the reported attacker in New York and New Jersey that wasn't a bomber, wasn't a terrorist, but now admittedly was working for ISIS.
[36:55.160 --> 36:59.160]  Told his father he was going to attack. He told the FBI nothing was done.
[36:59.160 --> 37:04.160]  We have all the spying. And every time it's used to make sure the bad guys go free.
[37:04.160 --> 37:08.160]  It's used to make sure that, oh, we've discovered FBI agents.
[37:08.160 --> 37:15.160]  This is the Justice Department three years ago are investigating the San Bernardino shooters who would later become the shooters.
[37:15.160 --> 37:19.160]  Let's put a criminal investigation on them for civil rights violations.
[37:19.160 --> 37:26.160]  The FBI was on the very people and was ordered to stand down.
[37:26.160 --> 37:31.160]  Think about that.
[37:31.160 --> 37:39.160]  Now, think about that.
[37:39.160 --> 37:55.160]  French news agency president Barack Obama is poised to veto legislation exposing Saudi Arabia to court action over the 9 11 attacks, stepping into defend legal precedent and an awkward ally, but inviting election time problems.
[37:55.160 --> 38:05.160]  White House officials say Obama will reject the justice against sponsors of terrorism act by a Friday veto deadline after a little over a week of liberation.
[38:05.160 --> 38:15.160]  And of course, what's in the 28 pages that the Saudi Royal House, that the king of Saudi Arabia was authorizing the 9 11 hijackers in the attack.
[38:15.160 --> 38:19.160]  People say, well, there's a lot more to it than that, Alex. I know that.
[38:19.160 --> 38:32.160]  But if you can prove that the government stood down and the FBI was ordered to stand down before and after the attacks and that no rabbits physically ordered to stand down, which we have from the former head of transportation.
[38:32.160 --> 38:37.160]  Norman Panetta in five different interviews, we've interviewed him.
[38:37.160 --> 38:41.160]  Our reporters on the street got a quick, but he said, no, I was there with Dick Cheney.
[38:41.160 --> 38:47.160]  It was a stand down. That is sensational. The plane's 50 miles out. It's 30 miles out. It's 20 miles out. It's 10 miles out.
[38:47.160 --> 38:55.160]  There's the order still stands, sir. Of course the order still stands. You hear anything else?
[38:55.160 --> 39:02.160]  So both parties at the top have committed this massive crime. They thought the corruption would be so big that it would bind them all together.
[39:02.160 --> 39:09.160]  It's called the cement of blood. That's a Nazi term that once they committed crimes together that that's known in criminology.
[39:09.160 --> 39:15.160]  That's known in gangs. That's known in warfare that they would then stick together because they're all guilty.
[39:15.160 --> 39:25.160]  And so once the upper echelon of the government was involved in the cover up, even after the fact, they could now be held accountable.
[39:25.160 --> 39:31.160]  And the word was even major university professors came out and said, okay, yeah, it was a staged event, but we can't bring this out.
[39:31.160 --> 39:36.160]  It'll bring down the entire government and the whole system and the greater good is, let the cover up continue.
[39:36.160 --> 39:41.160]  No, the greater good is, let it all come down. Obviously, it's bigger than the Saudis. We know that.
[39:41.160 --> 39:48.160]  I'm the expert on 9-11, folks. I've interviewed hundreds of them. I brought it out two months before 9-11 happened.
[39:48.160 --> 39:55.160]  So they're going to blow up the World Trade Centers blaming on their asset bin Laden, who will be involved, but he'll take the fall on and on and on.
[39:55.160 --> 39:58.160]  We told you the whole nine yards. Okay.
[39:58.160 --> 40:05.160]  And when I say I am the world expert, when I say I am the founder of 9-11 truth, it's a fact. It's undisputed.
[40:05.160 --> 40:15.160]  I'm not bragging, but I don't need a bunch of Johnny come lately here in 2016 to tell me I'm covering up 9-11.
[40:15.160 --> 40:25.160]  I'm exposing it, but I'm not going to let the globalist blame the whole United States government or other governments for it when it was a criminal, multinational, corporate combine
[40:25.160 --> 40:34.160]  invading our government, using our system at key juncture points and flipping off key intelligence switches so the attacks could take place.
[40:34.160 --> 40:41.160]  I'm going after the traders, the moles, the infiltrator. I'm not an idiot who lets the globalist stage this stuff.
[40:41.160 --> 40:46.160]  Blame America worldwide, which they've let 9-11 truth get out and do, but only to blame the U.S.
[40:46.160 --> 40:52.160]  And then turn around and bring a police state in on the heels of the terror threat.
[40:52.160 --> 40:59.160]  And again, you're like, oh, I've heard of this before. Yeah, it's happening with the 5 million invaders called refugees in Europe right now.
[40:59.160 --> 41:06.160]  It's happening with the million plus. Believe me, it's a million plus. They're everywhere. It's tens of thousands of the public schools in Austin in the last two years alone.
[41:06.160 --> 41:13.160]  I mean, it's amazing. I've lived here since high school. My grandmother's from here. It's like I live in the Middle East now.
[41:13.160 --> 41:19.160]  So just like in Europe, they'd say it was 100,000 when it was a million, when it was a million, it was 5 million.
[41:19.160 --> 41:24.160]  Same metric, same system, same operation.
[41:24.160 --> 41:36.160]  And so global crime syndicates are orchestrating terror, protecting terror networks to then set up the police state, which they believe they will control when they totally overthrow our governments.
[41:36.160 --> 41:40.160]  They haven't totally overthrown European governments yet. The EU's trying.
[41:40.160 --> 41:47.160]  They haven't totally overthrown the U.S. government they're trying. Now they stage a civil war. Now they stir up racial division.
[41:47.160 --> 42:01.160]  Now they have the very same people that funded the Arab Spring, the Wahhabist Sunni Spring, George Soros, billions in the State Department money, billions in Soros money, billions to destabilize Ukraine, 5 billion.
[42:01.160 --> 42:06.160]  He bragged about it on TV, CNN. Samantha Powers bragged about it at the State Department briefing.
[42:06.160 --> 42:16.160]  UN briefing, joint briefing. This is not my opinion. They think you're so politically illiterate, so geopolitically blind,
[42:16.160 --> 42:25.160]  so culturally dim, which I know you're not, especially the people that listen to the show. That's why military and governments listen.
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.160]  Where else do you hear real, frank discussions about the real world?
[42:29.160 --> 42:38.160]  You've got the unwashed, stupid, fake intellectual liberals that are into, you know, having socks that don't match, you know, that shows how smart they are and criticizing free speech.
[42:38.160 --> 42:46.160]  Let them sit over there on their squalor. They're victims of this wicked culture. He'll sorry for them. But move on from them.
[42:46.160 --> 42:53.160]  Don't worry about what they say or what they do or how they misrepresent.
[42:53.160 --> 42:58.160]  And so we have Obama protecting the Saudi Royal House along with the Republican leadership.
[42:58.160 --> 43:08.160]  And you've got the Bushes knee-deep in 9-11 and the Saudis along with the Clintons defending Hillary and saying, we want Hillary in power.
[43:08.160 --> 43:12.160]  We're going to vote for Hillary because they want her to continue a rearguard action of their crimes.
[43:12.160 --> 43:20.160]  They need her to stay in power to cover for all of them. And that's how they've got the Republican Democratic parties at the top merged together.
[43:20.160 --> 43:34.160]  And speaking of Hillary and her derangement, here's the larger clip of General Flynn last Friday introducing Donald Trump, bringing up the fact that Hillary looks like she's unstable and has serious problems.
[43:34.160 --> 43:35.160]  Here he is.
[43:35.160 --> 43:50.160]  If there was a temperament problem for anybody who watched the Commander-in-Chief's Town Hall a week or so ago, now you saw the temperament rise up in Hillary Clinton. And you saw her which stood up on the stage there to argue with the individual.
[43:50.160 --> 43:55.160]  I believe the gentleman that asked the question was out of the Navy or Navy veteran.
[43:55.160 --> 44:08.160]  That's a tough question. And she lost her temper. She lost her temper. And that's something that I think we have to pay very close attention to. We cannot have that kind of judgment in the White House.
[44:08.160 --> 44:27.160]  Then introduces Trump. Now, we need to take that clip and edit it together with the Democratic party ads implying that Obama is this wonderful savior, Hillary's the savior of stability, but that Trump's going to cause a nuclear war, but basically just reverse it
[44:27.160 --> 44:44.160]  and show the mushroom cloud going off with Hillary's eyes pointing different directions before she went off the campaign trail this week, with Hillary falling down, with Hillary blacking out, with Hillary wobble heading, with Hillary I came.
[44:44.160 --> 44:56.160]  I saw he died with secret service agents coming on this show. Former secret service agents are saying Hillary would knock Bill upside the head with a marble ashtray.
[44:56.160 --> 45:05.160]  Hillary would scream and yell at everybody and wouldn't give tips to people and you couldn't look her in the eyes. I mean, she was a monster 20 years ago on a hussy power trip.
[45:05.160 --> 45:14.160]  In there, you know, getting more tail than Bill Clinton in his own words. She was in there, you know, just in a man's world dominating. I'll give it to her that.
[45:14.160 --> 45:31.160]  But now the old brain, the old blood vessels, the old brain tumor caught up with her and they're so arrogant, they hope this corpse, this political corpse can coast across the line to home base, which shows how reckless these people are.
[45:31.160 --> 45:41.160]  I'm going to get into the situation next that's taking place in North Carolina and our reporter that's flying out as we speak to cover it tonight, Joe Biggs, pray for him.
[45:41.160 --> 45:50.160]  But before I go any further, we've extended it because it was so popular and a lot of people asked us to extend it. So we are extending it. Super male and super female vitality.
[45:50.160 --> 45:58.160]  We've got all these interest estrogen mimickers and toxins in the food and the water and we've got all of our hormones basically being suppressed.
[45:58.160 --> 46:07.160]  I don't know how all the ancient science works, but these are the known organic concentrated herbs cold pressed. You don't find it anywhere else.
[46:07.160 --> 46:17.160]  Some people claim cold pressed, but they're doing it with dry herbs that they make wet again and then cold pressed. Now this is fresh herbs, then cold pressed. That's why it's so amazing.
[46:17.160 --> 46:30.160]  It's 20% off and your purchase makes the broadcast possible. Well, thank you for your support. You've heard the right reviews and you can read more of the reviews, five star reviews at power reviews and other respected sites that we link to.
[46:30.160 --> 46:47.160]  Dr. P in Connecticut says 43 five star rating, but feeling 21 seemingly impossible results in minimal time, working 80 90 hours a week. I was beginning to feel run down two weeks that we're taking super male vitality and I feel the energy and enthusiasm that I have.
[46:47.160 --> 47:01.160]  And I was 21. Yeah, Shane Steiner has great genetics, you know, went to high school with him. But then he just still working out at like, you know, 38 or so. When I started hanging out with him again, you know, ran back into him and his family steak house and saw him.
[47:01.160 --> 47:08.160]  We started hanging out again. Since high school, you see, he'd left for, you know, over a decade his country music career was very successful, but he got out of it for family reasons.
[47:08.160 --> 47:17.160]  I'm going on a little diet about my high school friend and he just said, Oh, your supplements. Oh, yeah, look, Alex, you're out of shape. But he doesn't. Hey, I'm just trying to get back in shape. I'm launching these. They work great.
[47:17.160 --> 47:25.160]  He made fun of me, came back a month later and said, I want a whole case for my family and bought it. His dad's a big sports enthusiast, world champion, bull rider, stuff like that.
[47:25.160 --> 47:34.160]  They all went crazy over it. And that's because they take a lot of supplements and this really blew him away. And you know, here I am overweight out of shape.
[47:34.160 --> 47:40.160]  Like you got supplements. Is this a joke? You know, and he wouldn't be in mean to me. He's just like, you know, I'm not working on as hard as I should.
[47:40.160 --> 47:47.160]  I just don't feel like I'm into it anymore. And he came back and he said, it's the libido. This stuff is incredible.
[47:47.160 --> 47:57.160]  And I think his yard. He was there in the warehouse. He was making fun of me three years ago, making fun of me. And now Shane is just in most insane shape at 43 years of age.
[47:57.160 --> 48:04.160]  And he all puts it to supermail vitality. Just the mental thing it clicked for him to want to work out longer and harder.
[48:04.160 --> 48:11.160]  And the libido you feel right away in my experience as many others. Lauren, a five star review. I love it. Got this because my friend raved about it.
[48:11.160 --> 48:22.160]  I love the energy and the focus it gives. I was a bit of a skeptic, but I am a true believer. It's great part of my day. Absolutely.
[48:22.160 --> 48:30.160]  And there are other enhancement supplements out there that do a pretty good job. They all make me feel weird or too aggressive or break out.
[48:30.160 --> 48:36.160]  And this just hasn't done it. But try it for yourself. Consult your healthcare provider because it is a very, very serious supplement.
[48:36.160 --> 48:46.160]  Go see the five star reviews. There are 1471 of them. It's at a 4.5 star review by Power Reviews and review snapshots. There's a bunch of other ones.
[48:46.160 --> 48:53.160]  Just go check it out for yourself. Unprecedented. Unprecedented. I want to thank you for your support.
[48:53.160 --> 49:01.160]  Anthroplex is dry herbs, but it's organic. And quite frankly is a higher dose of some of the same stuff. Doesn't have everything that we know does.
[49:01.160 --> 49:10.160]  Has some things it doesn't. I don't want to say it's a poor man's, but it's half as much because it costs a lot less to make because it's dry herb.
[49:10.160 --> 49:17.160]  Still excellent. Still as fresh as we can get them. Not sitting in a warehouse for a year. I can tell you that. So it's fresh, dry herb.
[49:17.160 --> 49:24.160]  Which is what everything we sell should be because then you can source it and actually get it. It's hard to get organic.
[49:24.160 --> 49:29.160]  Dry herb that was just recently dried and fresh. That's hard enough to have it pass all the test.
[49:29.160 --> 49:33.160]  That's another issue is we try to have everything be California standard, which almost nobody can pass.
[49:33.160 --> 49:40.160]  Most of our products, I think 97% do a few of them. Sometimes a test comes back and something doesn't quite pass California.
[49:40.160 --> 49:44.160]  So we just put a, you know, insert with it when it goes to you that it doesn't pass California.
[49:44.160 --> 49:47.160]  And then when the next batch comes in and it does, then we don't have to put the insert in.
[49:47.160 --> 49:52.160]  But it's just a lot of hoops to jump through. This is serious stuff and it supports the broadcast.
[49:52.160 --> 50:04.160]  Secret 12 is the strongest organic form of methylcobalamin that Dr. River could come up with. Again, the supplement Nazi sites.
[50:04.160 --> 50:09.160]  And I don't mean literal Nazis. I mean, Seinfeld style, the folks that really know what they're doing and people that are obsessed with quality.

[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:43.160]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:57.160]  Just a fight, obliteration, no one cares anymore. The Messiah are mass murderer, no controlling who comes through the door. A culture made of cover.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:18.160]  Well, there is a composite character based on Mr. Benny played by Nicolas Cage in the new film, Snowden. And I wanted to get Mr. Benny, the former leader of the National Security Agency on, to get his view on the film and to discuss how accurate it is from my research.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:38.160]  It's extremely accurate on many, many fronts. I just want to say this is Oliver Stone's best work in my view. But I saw some areas in the film that even though I'd read books about Snowden and obviously read thousands of articles about it, I really wasn't aware of.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:48.160]  And when I say I wasn't aware of it, I knew all about it from other whistleblowers and my own research and the fact that pieces of it had come out over the years.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:10:09.160]  Like the Stuxnet and other systems that industrial hardware had been loaded into the software that ships themselves in layman terms into telecommunications and power grids around the world, including in our allies like Japan, Switzerland, Germany, you name it.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:35.160]  Because from the engineers I talked to, going back two decades, they were always explaining to me, Alex, keyword searches, basically a Google for the private internet, a Google for digital communication, a searchable system is the basis of echelon and what's going on.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:46.160]  Of course we have the top expert in the world, undisputed, so I'm just giving you a basic layman gestalt here, he'll correct any fallacies or any misrepresentations.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:58.160]  But from studying this 20 years, I've been on the cutting edge of having whistleblowers on and trying to understand it, that the big enchilada was the plan to load kill switches and things into key infrastructures around the world.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:11.160]  And the concern is, enemies or traders or terrorists or corporate extortion groups could get in and use those kill switches and control systems to wreak incredible havoc.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:20.160]  And shouldn't there be conventions against this type of warfare, just like there are against chemical, biological or nuclear, so that we try to not ever have it take place.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:28.160]  It just seems like building all these back doors into things and putting kill switches in things creates a vulnerability for everybody.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:40.160]  And look at how Hillary is being stung by these surveillance grids, look how George Soros says, look how Obama is, look at how all these crimes are coming out about the Bushes and the Saudis and the Clintons and all the rest of it.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:12:02.160]  Through this surveillance grid, they built, ignoring William Benny, who is admittedly the guy that built everything up to the late 1990s and 2001, but had it designed to actually defeat the Soviet Union, had it actually designed to roll up real terrorists with targeted information.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:14.160]  Instead, they created a system where no one's safe, no one has their data protected, and it's showing the arrogance of these elites that weren't 200 IQ geniuses like Mr. Benny is.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:28.160]  I mean, he's admittedly, even in mainstream news and the government says, one of the most famous code breakers ever, his thinking on computers and systems and breaking codes and algorithms is just second to none.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:36.160]  He's an idiot savant when it comes to it, if he doesn't mind me saying that. That's why he ran the actual NSA, not the Politico that would go talk to Congress.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:47.160]  And he tried to stop all this. We live in a world, then we're going to our guests for the rest of the hour. We live in a world where we have the supposed bomber in New York and in New Jersey.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:53.160]  His father two years ago comes to the FBI and says he's planning attacks, they do nothing because they're ordered not to.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:13:03.160]  And they had all this intelligence and data that he went to these foreign countries and did nothing. Same thing with the San Bernardino shooters major a sonnet for hood on and on and on.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.160]  Oh, Obama didn't see the ISIS and Al Qaeda invasions bull.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:19.160]  So the truth is, we have this giant grid and we're less safe. And that's what William Benny went through channels at, you know, resigned after he found out about all the spying in 2001.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:24.160]  He's been a frequent guest here. And I was recapping it for new viewers and listeners why this is so important.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:30.160]  And then he went and testified to Congress in secret and their response was to arrest William Drake, his colleague.
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.160]  Their response was to swat team him when he was in the shower on purpose.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:46.160]  William Benny, the answer was to persecute the very patriots, you know, that held the position of multi star generals in the command of this country actually fighting real enemies.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:51.160]  They just ignored them, pushed them aside and engage in this great act of treason.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:14:03.160]  And then you're watching the film. This is real stuff that happened. You've got Snowden's boss at the CIA, when he's the top contractor at Booze Allen, telling him, don't worry about your girlfriend cheating on you.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.160]  I went and checked on it. She's not cheating on you with that photographer.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:12.160]  And just the realization, the last straw for Snowden, that this guy's watching the lady he's about to marry.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:19.160]  And of course, it's all come out that most of these NSA people were, you know, out there doing stuff like this or watching people on webcams have sex.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:25.160]  And I mean, it's just incredible and so powerful. He may disagree. He's the real expert.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.160]  I'm going to skip this network break so we have more time.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:31.160]  William Benny, thank you so much for your courage and coming back on.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:38.160]  Agoodamerican.org is the documentary film coming out that you're in exposedfacts.org.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.160]  Bill Benny, thank you so much, sir.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:44.160]  Well, thanks for having me again, Alex. It's good to be with you.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:51.160]  In general, is what I said earlier, you know, a basically accurate kickoff?
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:15:03.160]  Actually, it's really spot on. I would only add that, you know, the recent exposure of some of the software that was, I mean, I think they have another Snowden in the NSA somewhere.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:15.160]  In the tailored access office because all their software going at weaknesses against the firewall, switches, servers and the networks was captured and is now out in the open.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.160]  People are trying to sell it.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:30.160]  So what they're really got been complaining about, because it's been very short-sighted of NSA and the FBI to do this, is to make they not only did they create the weaknesses,
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:41.160]  but they also found weaknesses in the systems, like called zero-day weaknesses, built into the software that companies were selling.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.160]  And they never told anybody, because that would be cybersecurity.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:52.160]  If they did that, I mean, that would protect people, would fix those, and they couldn't be penetrated by those weaknesses then.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:59.160]  So what they did was they allowed them to continue, and they did that simply because it allowed them a window to look into everything that everybody's doing.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.160]  And for them, that was the operations side.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.160]  They wanted to be able to do that so they could gather data on everybody.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:14.160]  But what it meant was they left everybody vulnerable and exposed, and that's why you're seeing all these hacks today.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.160]  It was very short-sighted of them.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.160]  And you warned them.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.160]  You resigned over this.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.160]  I mean, let's go over some of that.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.160]  This is 16 years ago, 15 years ago.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:34.160]  Yeah, so, I mean, first of all, the point that you would like is what it called Word.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.160]  Mr. Benny, Mr. Benny, I think you're on a cell phone.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.160]  We might try to get a landline with you.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.160]  I didn't know we were on cell.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.160]  Can you get to a different position for a second, please?
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.160]  Okay.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.160]  Let me see if I can move.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.160]  Okay.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.160]  You're a lot better.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.160]  Please continue.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.160]  Are you a little better?
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.160]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.160]  Go ahead.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:17:01.160]  Okay, well, I meant the dictionary select approach or word searches, like a Google search, has been the foundation of how they operated since the Pellex days, which is the 1930s.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.160]  And they took it through the courts, and all the courts agreed they could do that.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:13.160]  And so that's the why they continued doing that, instead of trying to think of a better way to do it, especially in the digital age, when they're buried with all kinds of data.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:20.160]  So, you know, that's what's making them dysfunctional, because when you do those word searches, you get so much material, you can't get through it.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:29.160]  That's one of the founding problems that they have and why they're failing to stop all these attacks, even when they know all the people who commit them.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.160]  That's amazing.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:43.160]  So, they leave all the vulnerabilities in the internet and telecommunications so they can break in easier in an automated way, knowing full well it leaves our government, our industries, our people open to hackers, open to other governments.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.160]  And they call that cyber security.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:48.160]  I call that the opposite.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.160]  Yep.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.160]  Wow.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.160]  That's a very short sum, I think.
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:18:04.160]  Well, when you told them this, more than 15 years ago, again, former leader of the NSA, William Benny, what did they say to you?
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:07.160]  Actually, they didn't say anything.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.160]  They just, they ignored me.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.160]  They, I couldn't get them to do anything I was suggesting.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:23.160]  It was, you know, after Hayden came in, they adopted the collect everything approach or bulk acquisition approach, why it was a hopeless case.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.160]  They simply wouldn't listen.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:32.160]  In the case of Tom Drake, when he went up to talk to the general counsel of NSA, they told him, don't ask any more questions.
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.160]  So, I mean, that was their answer.
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.160]  You know, watching the film Snowden, I want to talk about that a little bit with you, sir, but then get it in any area you want.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.160]  You're obviously an expert.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:45.160]  You're one of the few people that's actually in the same boat as Snowden in that, you know, in the film and also in speeches he's given.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:51.160]  He points out that he would write software to do something constitutional that actually helped us.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.160]  They would always twist it to do something unconstitutional or basically evil.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:03.160]  And then, of course, a lot of the things you developed, we now know were actually twisted into what's currently going on, Dr. Benny.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.160]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:13.160]  And actually, I was an advisor to Oliver Stone on the movie, so I tried to make sure that all the information he had was accurate.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:16.160]  So I should have pointed that out, obviously.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.160]  So that's why it's so incredibly accurate is that the former head of the NSA basically was the technical director.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.160]  So tell us about the film and what you think of it.
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.160]  Oh, I think the film is absolutely great.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.160]  It's a great film.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:35.160]  I mean, what it does is it takes you through someone, Edward Snowden, who starts off being a very positive supporter of the government and what it's doing,
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:44.160]  and then takes you through his life and experiences and how, in the end, he starts to see the corruption and the crime and the criminality of it.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.160]  And then he turns.
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.160]  And that's really what this is all about.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:57.160]  That story of his experiences going through his work with CIA and NSA.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.160]  I remember.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:12.160]  And I think it really shows to everybody that what's really, he really gives you a window into what's really happening, even though people don't realize that's what's going on.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:21.160]  Take some time then as the technical advisor on the film to break down what's really happening and what's really going on.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:28.160]  And then I'd like to ask you specifically about what I mentioned earlier, an area you never see on the news, but that is covered in the film.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.160]  And then I haven't really heard you elaborate too much on on this show.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:49.160]  But at least take some time out on loading the software and the hardware, the chips into all of our allies infrastructure and our own telecoms and our own computer companies working with the NSA CIA and others and private contractors to load the whole world with these
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:21:02.160]  tools, which again, the hackers all then learn about an exploit. I mean, it's our government basically ruining the internet for the world and letting bad hackers do whatever they want, not just our own government.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:09.160]  Yeah, I mean, you know, the point is that NSA and the US government have no monopoly on smart people.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:14.160]  So that that means any weakness they create in the system can be detected by others around the world.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.160]  It's not just governments, but it can be individual hackers.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.160]  I mean, it's not it's not something that is a smart thing to do.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.160]  If you find problems, you should fix them so you so that people are a little more secure.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160]  So that's the real problem.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.160]  But for example, they would do things.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:33.160]  There's three ways they go at the worldwide network.
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:42.160]  One is working with the the communications companies that own the fiber lines that allow them to to tap them in cooperation with them.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.160]  They help them do that.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:53.160]  And then the other is to go with governments and have the governments get involved, the intelligence agencies up, for example, the BND or GCHQ.
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:22:01.160]  Other intelligence agencies get in and cooperate with them in terms of tapping fibers and acquiring data.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:04.160]  And the third one is it's a unilateral thing.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:12.160]  If if nobody gets the agreement from the governments or the companies, they simply do it unilaterally covertly, you know, like that.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:23.160]  That would be the muscular taps of the fiber lines between the data centers of Yahoo, Google and all the major Internet service providers.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:28.160]  So they could tap all those lines with it without their approval or help.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:33.160]  And so it simply means that they're after all the data in the world.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:41.160]  The problem here is they all are so confused and I give them the benefit of the doubt.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:47.160]  So I get I say they're all confused in terms of saying and thinking that data is intelligence.
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.160]  Data is not intelligence.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.160]  It's simply data.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:58.160]  You have to analyze that and be able to figure out what it in what is meaning in that and data to be able to produce intelligence.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:04.160]  Yeah, just because you have a warehouse of books or a library doesn't mean you've read all those books.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:17.160]  Exactly. And you don't really know what the what the essence is of the books until you can understand them and be able to put a picture together and infer things like intentions and capabilities and threat.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.160]  Wow.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:25.160]  What about the particular areas where we see them shutting down the power grid and Internet grid of Syria, which we now know did happen.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:34.160]  And seeing that unfold, what about when we see the model of being able to get shut off the power of all of Tokyo or all of Japan?
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:38.160]  I mean, we're not just talking about putting grids into spy on the data.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:45.160]  The film gets into the kill switches, the systems they can use to actually shut down the power grid.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:24:06.160]  Yeah, what I think in the 30 C3 conference, a computer chaos club conference in Hamburg, Germany, two years ago, I think Jacob Appelbaum went through a whole series of programs they had from close in access to actually implanting hardware and
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:13.160]  software in in switches as they were transiting like Cisco switches that were being shipped through the mail.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.160]  They would waylay the shipment.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:21.160]  I've opened up the packages, insert hardware and software to allow them to take over the switch anytime they wanted.
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:24.160]  And then close it back up and let it continue on.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:29.160]  And then the poor sucker at the other end installs it in their system and they own their switch in their system.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:37.160]  And I've been told by whistleblowers inside the biggest carriers that it's industrial scale that we're not just talking about saying a city like Austin.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:43.160]  You know, you think you're going to go call them all go into a particular store and buy a product.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:50.160]  But they've got a lot of people in those that actually work as a side job as a quote homeland security infrastructure protection officer.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:54.160]  And they sit there with the data package and say, Oh, your package will be ready in a few days.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.160]  And then they jack it with all the crap and you come and pick it up.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:02.160]  I mean, this is industrial level espionage just against humanity.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:10.160]  Right, the whole world. Also, I would point out that's basically what the FBI and NSA were after with the iPhone and Apple.
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:15.160]  You know, the idea that they wanted they wanted Apple to out there.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.160]  There's more than 10.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.160]  They would delete everything on the phone.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.160]  Sorry, sorry, your phone cut out again there.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.160]  We know we can't use your landline because of tapping.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.160]  I wasn't supposed to get into that.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:31.160]  I know, but let's let's go back to your cell here and repeat what you just said, Mr. Benny.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.160]  Yeah, this is key intel on Apple.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.160]  I don't want this out, but let's go ahead and try to move another position.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.160]  We'll get this out.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.160]  Okay, they've been jamming his phone line folks.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.160]  We've got to go to a cell phone.
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.160]  This is the inside baseball.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.160]  Go ahead.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.160]  Can you?
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.160]  Okay, how's now?
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160]  Yes, we can hear you now, sir.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.160]  Go ahead.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:26:00.160]  Okay, well, I mean, with the Apple and the iPhone, what they were really after was Apple to get software to disable that password limitation in terms of testing and also the fact.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:11.160]  They couldn't do they had only put like one in a minute and also you needed to put in the full character spacing, which meant that somebody was tapping in and not a machine.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.160]  So they wanted them to design software to get around that.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:29.160]  And the reason they wanted to do that was because they already had stolen all of the user ID access codes from the SIM cards being produced by in the order of billions every year from companies.
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.160]  And so they have all these ID SIM card equivalences.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:46.160]  So these if these SIM cards were involved in any iPhone in the world that once they signed on, they could access it remotely from any from NSA to any point in the world.
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.160]  So they want the ultimate backdoor hardwired and everything into Apple's credit.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.160]  They were the one of the only companies not doing that.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.160]  Correct.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.160]  That's right.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.160]  Yep.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:27:01.160]  And that's good that they bought them because this is, you know, this is actually in a say, I think already had the ability to do that.
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:09.160]  And they just the FBI wanted to do it so they could claim that that would be the what how they access the data and be admissible in court.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.160]  Let's let's.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.160]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.160]  No, I'll go ahead.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.160]  You're sorry.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.160]  Well, there's so many questions.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:18.160]  I'm jumping around here because it's just mystifying how powerful the film is.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.160]  And I know that you were a consultant on it.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:24.160]  About that a few years ago, and then I it clicked, of course, you were the technical advisors.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.160]  That's why it's so incredibly accurate.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:33.160]  But looking at this now, where we are today projecting forward.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:37.160]  The I mean, the film breaks down the fact that it's gotten worse under Obama, not better.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.160]  And it seems like they're just moving forward.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:42.160]  Where does this end?
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:49.160]  Well, unless we stand up and do something about it, it's going to get even worse with the internet of things, you know, that's only going to get worse.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:55.160]  So that I mean, that means all the devices that you have known are going to be connected to the internet.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.160]  That's that's going to make it exceedingly bad.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.160]  So now accessible and controllable.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.160]  All accessible and controllable.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.160]  Absolutely.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:07.160]  The driver was cars, the smart meters, everything wired in.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.160]  So it's not just this technocracy jacking into governments and power grids.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.160]  Now it's your house.
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:14.160]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.160]  And everything in it that's electronic that's running.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:24.160]  Were you ever given a snakers and things like that, you know, if you want.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.160]  Oh, it's just unlimited what they can do with it.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.160]  What about a larger plan?
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:36.160]  I mean, I know it's about looting and making money hundreds of billions of dollars globally a year by these companies.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.160]  But what's the master strategy on building this technocracy?
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.160]  I mean, do they have one?
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.160]  I think it's a well, this is my impression.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:53.160]  Okay, certainly it is population control.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:57.160]  But not just of any given country, but of the world.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:06.160]  And so what they're after and directed and I think the Obama has stated this from various points that he wanted a world community.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.160]  So I think that's probably what they're after in order to do that.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.160]  They have to be able to control the people of the world.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:20.160]  So in order to do that, you have to have knowledge of them to know who's doing what so you can stop it or manipulate it any way you want.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.160]  William Benny, that is the most profound thing I think I've ever heard you say and you've said a lot of profound things.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:31.160]  This is the key for a technocracy world government program and Davos admits that's their plan.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:37.160]  But here you are the former leader of the National Security Agency telling us that that's what they're building.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.160]  A beast system.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:42.160]  If you're not a Christian, it almost makes you one, doesn't it?
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.160]  William Benny is our guest.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.160]  Exposedfacts.org publishes some of his writings.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.160]  He's also in the new documentary, AGoodAmerican.org. Stay with us, sir.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:53.160]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:30:19.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:24.160]  A witness photographed the man with the gun, cooperating the police version of what happened.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:28.160]  That he was armed and ignored repeated verbal commands to drop his handgun.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:34.160]  Hillary saying an unarmed black man has been shot again was a dog whistle for black lives matter to get whitey.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:39.160]  Even though it was a black cop who shot the black man, working for a black police chief in a city run by Democrats.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:44.160]  Now we have seen fires, doors looted, white people dragged, beaten, begging for mercy.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:51.160]  Yet even as these facts and photos emerge, Hillary refuses to walk back the statement or to try to calm the situation.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:55.160]  Thanks, Hillary. I guess rioters and looters are stronger together.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.160]  One thing's for sure, they're with her.
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:26.160]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:27.160]  We're going to go back to William Benning here in just a moment. He's with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:34.160]  We really are thankful for his time. He's going to tell you in a moment when the new documentary that he's in and also an advisor on
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:38.160]  A Good American is coming out at GoodAmerican.org.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:46.160]  But again, Snowden, I just couldn't believe how accurate it was that Hollywood is corrupt as it is, that this came out.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:50.160]  It gave me hope. We're going to be talking to him here in just a moment.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:55.160]  Wayne Madson is going to be popping in the investigative journalist. Farmer with the National Security Agency as well.
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:34:01.160]  He's popping in with a few questions the next 30 minutes, but he'll ride shotgun with us for 30 minutes into the next hour as well.
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.160]  And then I'll open the phones up and then Anthony Gucciardi is coming up.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:12.160]  We've got Joe Biggs in the air going to North Carolina to Charlotte, where George Soros admittedly and the globalists are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:20.160]  trying to start a civil war to distract from the ongoing global colonization of the United States and everybody else that's taking place.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:24.160]  I can't believe I'm saying this. It sounds like a science fiction movie, but it's in the emails.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:30.160]  And we'll talk more about, with William Benning, what he warned of 15 years ago to the government, just biting them in the ass.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:37.160]  And I'm sorry to use that term, but that's what's happening, where they build all these back doors to screw us and everybody's getting in and it's bringing them down.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.160]  It almost makes me want Big Brother, but I actually don't, but it's destroying him.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.160]  And he's the first guy months ago that said he thinks it's somebody inside the government because of the way it's coming out.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.160]  And this is a guy that used to, you know, be able to track the Russians and predict and find people. He's really smart.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.160]  But then I started talking to government sources and people started getting executed and killed and arrested.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.160]  And they said, no, this is the U.S. government. This is the U.S. Army.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:05.160]  It's people inside different political organizations. Democrats are seeing all this evil.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:09.160]  They know how bad Hillary is. And so they're trying to say the Russians are doing all this.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:16.160]  And we're these traders. Anybody that exposes, you know, what's happening with the NSA, when they're the ones that have sold us out.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:19.160]  So they're being hoisted on their own patard, as they say.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:23.160]  But before we go any further, we're listed supported with our great sponsors.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:30.160]  One of them that we've had for, I don't know, 16, 17 years. Solutions from Science always advertises once they have a sale going.
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:36.160]  Solutions from Science, Solar Summer Sales, about to end because fall has just started, but it's been extended just a few weeks.

[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.160]  Solutions from Science is one of my oldest sponsors and I've been around forever.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:59.160]  Right now they're having a solar summer sale and they have many different options to choose from, including solar generators, wind turbines, EMP bags.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:03.160]  That's to not be tracked. Smart LED, light bulbs, and much more.

[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:24.160]  That's Summersolarsale.com.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:36.160]  So a lot to cover. Obviously, we're running some specials that are going to end very soon that we've extended on some of the nutraceuticals and supplements, like super male and super female vitality.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:47.160]  We also have 20% off of high quality organic vitamin B12 with our own proprietary brand Secret 12. It's organic, vegan, highly absorbable.
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:54.160]  You take it under the tongue and several drops a day. This is what I give myself, my children, and the great part about it is, these are high quality products.
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:37:02.160]  The five star review on third party sites, reviewed by thousands, and it's what I personally use and it supports the broadcast and getting the word out.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:05.160]  So it's so incredibly important.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:09.160]  Now going back to William Benning.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:25.160]  Mr. Benning, I've been asking a lot of the questions here today, but I'd like to give you a few minutes to talk about other areas, other topics that are coming out dealing with the NSA, with all these other agencies, with the 800,000 contractors that have top secret access.
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:35.160]  I mean, this just sounds like a recipe for disaster. Other points you'd like to relay as the former leader of the National Security Agency to our viewers and listeners.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:44.160]  Well, I guess what I could basically say is that the real threat here is that intelligence is being outsourced to contractors.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:55.160]  All types, including analysis and translation, as well as hardware, software, and the maintenance of your entire infrastructure of the intelligence community.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:38:01.160]  So it's pretty much morphing into a commercial operation.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:16.160]  This is not good. I mean, you know, commercial companies have a different objective than government organizations that government has a more of a, at least a charter to do good things for the country.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:23.160]  Whereas corporations, their interest and focus is getting contracts and making money and profits.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:33.160]  So the two, and it's very clear, for example, in the film that is about me that's coming out in February next year called A Good American,
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:43.160]  it's very clear in that movie that you'll see how these corporations are manipulating the entire intelligence community and how they're actually doing harm to intelligence production.
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:54.160]  In fact, what I've been saying publicly for some number of years is what they've done is they've traded the security of the people of the United States and people of the world for money.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:39:03.160]  And they did that by outsourcing the corporations and letting the corporations really govern how they operate and what they do.
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:07.160]  And this is not good for any country.
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:14.160]  Simply put, it sounds like they would only want to make the world worse and have more threats so they could get more funding.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.160]  And really, it's our government being taken over by multinational corporations.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:25.160]  We're being conquered by the multinationals while they claim that the Russians are going to hack our election.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:37.160]  So the UN and the EU and the OECD are coming in to, quote, monitor our elections. What does that sound to you like, Mr. Benny?
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:41.160]  Well, it sounds like another step towards a world government, you know, a world organization.
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.160]  So, I mean, it's just more of the same.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.160]  It's just extending in a different facet.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:52.160]  It's expanding in different aspects of life.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:40:02.160]  You know, the OSCE is the paramilitary intelligence arm of the OECD, and that's the private corporation that took over Europe after World War II and the Marshall Plan.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.160]  That is the root of the EU and the global government.
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:14.160]  Again, the former head of the NSA, a technical, the actual leader of it, who helped bring down the Soviet Union, was, you know, privately awarded, the highest award you can get.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.160]  I don't know if you can get into those.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:26.160]  They're telling us that America is being taken over by global government, and Obama, two days ago, when I played a short clip, sir, was at the UN, and he said, look, we got to give up some of our sovereignty to be part of this global thing.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.160]  Well, it's like we're giving up sovereignty to be with other countries.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:38.160]  We're giving up sovereignty to this mega corporate system that wants a carbon tax that has given itself diplomatic immunity, tax immunity.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.160]  This is the new royalty.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:49.160]  Here's our president saying we should sign over to this. We should submit to the TPP and the rest of it. It is outrageous. Here it is.
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:55.160]  But we have to put our money where our mouths are.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:09.160]  And we can only realize the promise of this institution's founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:20.160]  Sometimes I'm criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:38.160]  But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term enhances our security.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:46.160]  So they have big global multinational corporations that have secret trade deals that seat our authority and they admit that.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:51.160]  And then he says to be safe and to be happy. We do that. We sign on to it. This is how we're being conquered.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:54.160]  The 21st century, it's corporate. It's not military.
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:00.160]  And then as the film shows, and as they admit, most of the spying on the American people has nothing to do with stopping jihadis.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:12.160]  And then Obama's been caught funding the jihadis as a Saudi Arabian proxy army. William Benny, hearing that clip, he went on to say we need a liberal world order, a liberal world government.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:16.160]  Exactly what you got into. I haven't heard you talk about world government being the objective.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:24.160]  I mean, it clearly is. Can you elaborate with your geopolitical and geospatial and technical understanding?
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:35.160]  Yeah, see, that's the problem that technology has made this all possible. I mean, I've heard recently some people in Congress saying, you know, following all these people traveling around the world is just too difficult.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:46.160]  We need more people. No, you don't. That's a trivial issue. I mean, we could easily follow 12 to 20 billion phone calls a day if that's, you know, like 10 million people moving around every day is trivial.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:50.160]  That's a trivial issue. So all of that could be done by technology.
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:55.160]  And yet they're claiming something is really difficult when, in fact, it's not.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:43:04.160]  And so they're actually basically hiding the facts of what they're really doing by saying those things.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:07.160]  And of course, they make it more difficult for anybody to...
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:18.160]  But it's a way of getting more money, more support than squeezing the populace and basically swindling them out of money and resources.
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:22.160]  So that's really what the whole objective is.
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:26.160]  Well, we have shot a lot of special reports with you when you've come and visited us here in Austin.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.160]  We're going to retweet some of those today and repost some of those on infowars.com.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:37.160]  But undoubtedly, we're now in this paradox where they denied all this existed before, back when it was being done more constitutionally.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:42.160]  And now that it's beyond 1984, I mean, just exponentially beyond it.
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:48.160]  I'd say billions of times beyond it, literally, when it comes to the amount of data being collected,
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.160]  that they just throw it in our face that we should just accept it.
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:57.160]  I mean, it is positive that this film is out as one of the top films of the country. It's causing a debate.
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.160]  But are you an optimist or a pessimist?
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:06.160]  I mean, I think I'm an optimist if we expose to people that were being conquered by multinational technocracy in their own words.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:14.160]  If we don't define it as the fact we're being taken over and just fight their fake paradigm of, oh, you know,
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:19.160]  spy on us to keep us safe or not, I think we can beat this if we shadow the whole paradigm.
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.160]  But I think if we just argue about Big Brother, we're going to lose. What do you think, sir?
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:27.160]  Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I mean, the sunshine is what they're really afraid of.
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:32.160]  Exposing what they're really doing and who's involved is really what they're afraid of.
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:36.160]  And that's why I keep trying to say these things publicly.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:43.160]  My point, when I was on USA Today on TV shortly after Snowden until first started coming out,
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:46.160]  they asked me what I thought should happen with Edward Snowden.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:52.160]  I said I thought he should be indicted, but that the law should be applied equally and a chronological sequence of the crimes.
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:57.160]  So we need to start first with Bush, Cheney, Hayden and Tennant, all the people in their organization,
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:02.160]  the White House and the Department of Justice, NSA, CIA and FBI were participating
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:06.160]  in this violation of really treason against the founding principles of this nation
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:12.160]  and violations of the law, pen register law, electronic privacy, electronic security act
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:17.160]  and also all the FCC regulations governing the telecoms, they violated all of that.
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:21.160]  And so after that, that's where we should start with the criminal prosecutions.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:24.160]  Then we should move to the Obama administration to the same people.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:29.160]  And then we do Snowden. And since then, not too many people will ask me what should happen to Snowden.
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:33.160]  I want to bring Wayne Madsen in for the rest of the hour to ask you some questions.
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:39.160]  He was formerly obviously with the NSA, but his main job was internal security and finding leaks,
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:43.160]  which tie into your fact of building all these back doors is what created the leaks.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:48.160]  I want him to ask some of his questions, so it's not just an average lay researcher asking him,
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:51.160]  William Benny, former leader of the National Security Agency, is our guest.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:54.160]  But there was an article came out on September 17th.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:00.160]  And I found it ironic that the Washington Post was with the Guardian, given this info,
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:05.160]  it's been well known to be CIA since it was basically set up in the 1940s,
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:10.160]  since it was taken over by the Grams. Now it's run by Bezos and the folks in Amazon, the Democratic Party.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:15.160]  But to have them make money off the Snowden story, take the data and report on it,
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:20.160]  then they misrepresent what Snowden did, said he released classified information that hurt people
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:26.160]  and he didn't, he exposed the crimes. But to take the info, publish it and still call for no pardon,
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:32.160]  and for him to be basically put in prison or executed, I find to be the height of hypocrisy and arrogance.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:35.160]  What do you make of the Washington Post saying no pardon for Edward Snowden,
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:39.160]  which obviously the movie Snowden pushes for?
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:47.160]  Well, I've been trying now, so the government is violation of their own regulations.
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:57.160]  For example, Executive Order 3526 is the executive order classification of all material in the U.S. government.
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:03.160]  Section 1.7 of that says that you cannot classify, maintain classified or not declassify,
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:11.160]  information that's evident to the crime, corruption, fraud, waste, abuse, or embarrassment of a person or an agency.
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:14.160]  And it says several other things, but those are the core ones.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:17.160]  And that says that they're in violation of their own regulations.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:24.160]  So, I mean, it's like they're all saying, they're playing the game of the Wizard of Oz,
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:30.160]  pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, only look at this person over here, they're the bad guy.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:36.160]  Very well said, and I think that Snowden, to a great extent, is a todo in this whole thing,
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:40.160]  but so is yourself and Wayne Madsen and others, and it's not that I even call you heroes,
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:48.160]  even though in a world of cowards you are a superhero, it's just that we have so many people
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.160]  that are just willing to go along with this and deny it's even happening,
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:57.160]  and people like you are shattering that paradigm and forcing them to face the man behind the curtain.
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:00.160]  I want to bring in Wayne Madsen and WayneMadsenReports.com.
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:03.160]  He'll be talking about this again after you leave in about 15 minutes,
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.160]  but you're on the air with William Benny.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:10.160]  What are your questions or comments for this gentleman, Wayne?
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:14.160]  Well, first, hi Bill, and congratulations on the film.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:16.160]  I look forward to seeing it.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:26.160]  And Alex, I think one of the most grotesque things about the Washington Post calling for no pardon
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:31.160]  for Snowden and effectively calling for his arrest, prosecution, and imprisonment
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:37.160]  is the fact that it's a violation of one of the arch cannons of journalism.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:42.160]  They called for the arrest and imprisonment of one of their own sources.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.160]  Exactly.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:51.160]  And that, you know, they got a Pulitzer Prize which they shared with the Guardian because of that story.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:58.160]  So on the one hand, they bask in the respectability of receiving a Pulitzer Prize
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:04.160]  at the same time they're calling for maximum punishment of one of their sources.
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:05.160]  And let's be clear.
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.160]  This is the paper.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:07.160]  This is the editorial board.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.160]  This is not some one of their other writers.
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:13.160]  These are the most dishonorable snot-nosed people I've ever seen in my life.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:17.160]  Mr. Benny, do you have a comment on this level of disgraceful activity?
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:22.160]  Yeah, I think the reason they did all the, took advantage of what Snowden had provided originally
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:30.160]  was because of Bart Gelman. He had the integrity and got to just go into that and make sure it got published.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:37.160]  So I mean, otherwise, you know, otherwise many of us look at it as the Washington compost.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.160]  Some say it's the worst publication in the country.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.160]  Wayne, we're about to go to break, but other questions.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.160]  You're talking to William Benny.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.160]  What have I not been asking?
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:54.160]  Well, yeah, I mean, I think you hit this thing with Obama's speech to the UN, and it's quite clear when you look.
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:50:03.160]  And Bill, I mean, you don't have to go into the details, but when I look at those Snowden slides and I see all the
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:12.160]  Foreign Affairs Directorate relationships between the NSA and good God, maybe 60 or some countries around the world,
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:17.160]  some of which are not known to be close allies of the United States.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:20.160]  You just wonder what the end game is.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:33.160]  Here is it to place the world under some sort of a global surveillance network, regardless of how it helps or hurts U.S.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:34.160]  nationals.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.160]  Let's come back and talk about this global surveillance directorate because we've hit on it here.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.160]  This isn't the NSA.
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:40.160]  This is a corporate global takeover.
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:43.160]  People in the NSA like William Benny and others have been fighting it.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.160]  They are heroes.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.160]  We'll be back with William Benny to respond to this.
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:51.160]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are our sites.
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.160]  The new app launched two days ago.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:59.160]  It's already in the top 30 on the big Apple site and is the fourth most searched app.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:28.160]  It's in force.
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:34.160]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:39.160]  has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:43.160]  The solution is Defender Shield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding ever developed.
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:50.160]  Defender Shield locks virtually 100% of EMF radiation from cell phones, tablets and laptops and starts at just $64.99.

[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:04.160]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:31.160]  But if you just tuned in, William Benny, Patriot, one of the top code breakers in U.S. history,
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:35.160]  created much of the software and the infrastructure that won the Cold War.
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:39.160]  That's on record. This guy was a hero before he went to Congress and said,
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:44.160]  you're building backdoors into everything. He makes the entire Internet and everything open to hackers.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:47.160]  It's spying on everybody's webcam. Stop it.
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:51.160]  And they said, nope, he resigned. Then they swat team him.
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:55.160]  They started arresting people. I mean, this is serious business.
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:55:00.160]  And they're committing these crimes. They're getting away with it, but not forever.
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.160]  And you are getting into world government again.
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:07.160]  Whether it was intentional or not, and they now admit it's intentional,
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:12.160]  they've transferred data, they've transferred a global system of surveillance
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:17.160]  that corporations, just a few Fortune 100, control.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:23.160]  This is a corporate world government, and you were just speaking to it when Madsen brought it up.
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:28.160]  This is basically, in my view, a foreign multinational takeover.
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:33.160]  This is a 21st century attack. We're wondering what wars would look like in the future.
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:36.160]  This is an information war, and they've taken over.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:39.160]  They admit the stock markets rigged. The currency markets are rigged.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:42.160]  They admit the interest rates are rigged.
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:48.160]  I mean, everything's rigged now by JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, and they're the ones at the heart of these multinational agreements.
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:55.160]  Can you elaborate on that, and what do we do to unseat them to illustrate this to people, sir?
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:02.160]  Well, from my point of view, I mean, if the British company is becoming like the...
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:09.160]  Some of them are becoming things like the six military industrial intelligence contractors in the U.S.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:18.160]  And if you look at, like Wayne had pointed out, all of the first, second, and third party agreements between countries,
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:22.160]  that doesn't count fourth parties that aren't even listed.
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:28.160]  So it's like those who we don't want to recognize we have a relationship with at all,
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.160]  which goes far beyond those already exposed by Snowden.
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:38.160]  So if you look at all of that, it's really saying you're using all of this intelligence you're gathering
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:46.160]  to gain influence and access and control and also acceptance by other countries around the world.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:52.160]  So they're all trying to join this club of having all this knowledge about everybody.
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:59.160]  The main parties are, of course, the Five Eyes, the main English-speaking, the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:07.160]  but also a number of other European countries are participating right now, up to seven or eight of them, I think, in this internet stuff.
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:09.160]  But also others are trying to get into that.
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:10.160]  That's another question.
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:11.160]  What do you make?
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.160]  You know, we hear we're, quote, handing over the DNS and control the internet to, quote, the world,
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:19.160]  but really it's the same group of corporations and the UN that we were just talking about.
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:22.160]  So again, the coup is ongoing.
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:30.160]  Yeah, I don't see it's all like a, what do you want to, if you could refer to it as a self-licking ice cream cone, you know,
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:33.160]  it's all serving itself.
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:37.160]  And it's just keeping, it keeps growing and growing and growing.
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:43.160]  The only thing we could do is try to expose it and try to get people to get to understand that this is not really good for anybody.
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:46.160]  And we do all stand up and resist this.
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:55.160]  And if people that we elect in Washington or any other governments don't want to stop this, I mean, we should insist and fire them all
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:57.160]  and hire people who will stop it.
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:58.160]  Absolutely.
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:00.160]  And vote with our dollars.
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:05.160]  Don't support self-driving cars, the globalists that are getting rid of us in cars, the total technology takeover.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.160]  Wayne, we're going to break.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:07.160]  He's with us five more minutes.
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:08.160]  Ask the question now.
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:11.160]  We'll come back and hear the answer in the next segment.
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:15.160]  Another one of your interesting questions for Mr. Benning.
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:21.160]  Well, I would ask Bill on the fourth party agreements.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:31.160]  When I see a country like Brazil listed, I wonder how much of that information was used to bring down their own president, Bruce Sefton, a constitutional coup.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.160]  That's a great question.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:37.160]  Let's talk about destabilization efforts using these systems in 70 seconds.
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:38.160]  We'll be back with William Benning.
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:40.160]  Stay with us.
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:43.160]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:49.160]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:59.160]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:05.160]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWareShore.com.
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:13.160]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:19.160]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:25.160]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:32.160]  Just go to InfoWareShore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:39.160]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWareShore.com, this is a sure win.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:45.160]  10% off on auto ship. Win, win, win at InfoWareShore.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:49.160]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:59:49.160 --> 02:00:12.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:14.160]  We're on the march.
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:19.160]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:25.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:29.160]  And the empire we face is a private corporate, anti free market empire.
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:33.160]  It runs the leftist, you name it.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:37.160]  It admits, I mean their white papers are public, they're very arrogant, they're establishing a technocracy.
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:41.160]  They call their form of government global technocracy in the technotronic era.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:45.160]  That's Zbigniew Brzezinski. He wrote that book in 1974. They've done it.
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:47.160]  They're like 90% of the way there.
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:55.160]  And they have one of the top brains in the world, William Benning, giving you his analysis of a private corporate, global, technotronic based system.
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:01:00.160]  He's going to leave us here in about four minutes. I'm very thankful for his time, his courage, what he's gone through.
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:06.160]  I have to pinch myself that I'm not dreaming here because I'm so honored to be with this crew.
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:12.160]  And people like Wayne Madsen, people like William Benning, who are filled with integrity.
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:16.160]  And this is the stuff that made America great, people like William Benning.
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:22.160]  You heard his question about fourth parties, Brazil, people signing on 40 stabilization campaigns, internal coups,
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:28.160]  shining deals with the globalist to then get the data to be able to carry out coups in their country.
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:31.160]  Can you speak to that, Mr. Benning?
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:39.160]  Well, I think Wayne's question is basically spot on with what they're doing with this information.
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:41.160]  They're using it to control people.
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:45.160]  I mean, people, you know, they keep saying, well, if you haven't done anything wrong, you've nothing to fear.
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:47.160]  Well, that's totally irrelevant.
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:52.160]  The only thing that makes any difference is whether or not you're doing something to irritate the central regime.
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:56.160]  And if you are, they will use all this data against you.
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:06.160]  And I used the case that they're going against the bankers, putting them, you know, charging them criminally with defrauding people back in 2007, 2008.
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:17.160]  You can look at others like Petraeus, like Jim Ryzen, Jim Rosen, the AP, other kinds of reporters who have been intimidated and threatened.
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:21.160]  All of that is taking, they're taking this material and using that to do that.
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:27.160]  Or they're using it against the Tea Party or the Occupy Group or other kinds of politically active groups that they don't want to be active.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:28.160]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:39.160]  So, you know, this is, this is really the insidious part of it when they, when they allow the collection of acquisition of data and content information as well as metadata.
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:44.160]  It's not just metadata, there's content as well on everybody in the planet.
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:52.160]  To be able to intimidate and shut everybody down, absolutely, an iron fist, what would have Hitler or Stalin have done with this in closing?
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:56.160]  And I want to get one final question.
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:05.160]  Haven't they, in a way, and we're not endorsing the police state or the surveillance grid, dug their own pit because good people in government, and I concur with what you first said months ago, it's true, it's not the Russians.
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:12.160]  It's people in our own government, corporations, the Democratic Party that are leaking info, it's come out that are exposing this habit.
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:21.160]  Haven't they, with this Panoptagon spy grid, built the engine of their own destruction? Won't it be their arrogance as their final downfall?
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:27.160]  Yes, it can very easily be, simply because all the information is there about them too.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:31.160]  So, I mean, I would also make one more point, Alex, if I could.
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:33.160]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:41.160]  All this trouble in the Ukraine, you know, you can use this data also to do, enable things like regime change.
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:51.160]  And, for example, when, you know, the undersecretary state was saying, Yats is our guy, well, Yats eventually became the next head of the Ukraine.
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:56.160]  So, it kind of implies that they were involved in some way in making that come to pass.
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:00.160]  Which, of course, irritated the Russians. You can understand that.
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:10.160]  And even later on, when they violated the agreement they had with the Russians about not inviting anybody like Ukraine into NATO, then they go ahead and do that too.
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:16.160]  So, obviously, they're doing some things to, like, irritate the big bear, you know, Russia.
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:21.160]  So, I mean, they're not, it's not just the one-sided issue here. We have, we played our part too.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:27.160]  And this information, I think, is a part of that, and that process of how they're doing it.
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:35.160]  Well, sir, you did an amazing job on the film as the technical advisor on Snowden. Congratulations. Please come back soon.
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:42.160]  I'm going to come back with Wayne Madsen after this, but William Benny, thank you so much for your time at GoodAmerican.org, the film coming out next February.
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:44.160]  William Benny, thank you so much.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:46.160]  Yeah, well, thank you, and thanks for having me.
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:51.160]  Yvette, I'll say bye to you during the break if you can hold one moment. Didn't get Wayne's last question, but I have plenty to say when we come back.
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:05:07.160]  Wow, investigative journalist Wayne Madsen straight ahead. That was William Benny saying it's a global government corporate takeover using information warfare.
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:25.160]  We're on the same stage, or will they try to do another forum like we've seen before?
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:36.160]  This is all going to be leading up to our 48-hour long coverage on November 8th of the election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and the future of America.
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:48.160]  Make sure you spread this like wildfire because we need to get patriots all over the country, aligned and ready to stand up and make the changes we need done by voting
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:56.160]  someone in who will actually take America back and make America great again. This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com.

[02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:49.160]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:26.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:38.160]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:54.160]  Heard Vonnegut sent me a lithograph about six months before he died. The bird cage. The door opened. The bird was long gone. Free bird.
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:09:11.160]  And here we are on the cusp of open world government carried out by Eugenicist. And we have the former director of the NSA coming out separately from my analysis and saying exactly what we're saying.
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:26.160]  We have General Flynn, the former head of defense intelligence saying exactly what I'm saying. You've got Donald Trump coming out and saying what I'm saying because it isn't what Alex Jones is saying.
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:39.160]  They've got the same eyeballs, the same brain. The globalists have really screwed up. They were so arrogant early on with their corporate media control that they would write books to brag to each other.
[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:48.160]  I mean some of them bestsellers about the public scum. We run the Democrats and Republicans. We're setting up a world government. Yeah, we're poisoning the food and water.
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:55.160]  Yeah, we ship the drugs in. Yeah, we destabilize Mexico. Look at them.
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:10:03.160]  They'll all come up here poor, begging for stuff. We'll implode the wages here. I mean just the arrogance of them is going to undo them.
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:13.160]  And it is people in corporations, people in the Democratic Party, people in the telecoms that are exposing all this.
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:17.160]  There's so many leaks coming out. That's why Soros and Hillary are all panicking.
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:25.160]  And their answer is to try to go take a few sad events with police and hype them all up to burn down cities.
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:34.160]  That backfire, it woke the police up. The police kind of went from a globalist, halfway mind control position, and the last few years are like totally awake.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:40.160]  Everything they're doing is blowing up in their face. The bottom of the hour, but very special report. I'm just going to stop there and leave it.
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:45.160]  I want to go to Wayne Manson who's been riding shotgun with us. I wanted to get him on a little early so he could ask a few questions.
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:53.160]  But I tell you, Wayne, was that not an amazing interview with Benny? I mean the former head of the NSA coming out and saying it's a global corporate takeover,
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:11:01.160]  transferring our sovereignty and our information to a foreign system. It's treason. I mean, wow, that's powerful.
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:11.160]  Well, absolutely it was. You know, when I was at the NSA, I very rarely had any contact with people in the higher echelons like Bill Benny.
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:24.160]  The only time I'd see them were at like defense conferences and trade shows, and that was only idle chitchat if I ever did get to talk to him, but he was the real deal.
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:37.160]  He was in the technical and policy branch of NSA, and he and others from NSA and others from the CIA have come out and ended the defense intelligence agency,
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:43.160]  including General Flynn, who you just mentioned, have come out and said what an awful situation we see today.
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:52.160]  And now I would note that John Brennan reportedly, the CIA director, wants to continue in that role under Hillary Clinton if she's elected.
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:59.160]  And here's a guy who just admitted he voted for Communist Party candidate Gus Hall in 1970s.
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:07.160]  And by the way, I'm sure that was his cover, but they say he actually became a lobbyist and joined Islam, and I heard that. It was later partially confirmed.
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:11.160]  Now he admits he was a communist. I mean, what the hell's going on here?
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:19.160]  Well, here, I think the fact that he admitted he voted for a guy like Gus Hall, and Gus Hall was not a, he wasn't even a committed communist.
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:24.160]  He was probably a government agent, like three quarters of the members of the party USA.
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:36.160]  But anyway, for him to admit that, a guy who came up through Catholic schools, who came from an Irish immigrant family, went to Fordham in New York,
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:47.160]  for him to say he voted for a communist, and then for him to deny charges that he embraced Wahhabist Islam when he was a CIA station chief in Riyadh,
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:52.160]  I think just goes to show that this guy has no moral turpitude.
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:55.160]  That's it. We know what he is. He's a chameleon.
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:13:06.160]  Yes, of course. So he'll, he'll change his spots according to what benefits him and his cabal, whatever that cabal may be in 1976.
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:12.160]  I believe he probably said he might have been trying to infiltrate the Communist Party.
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:14.160]  I just want to ask.
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:19.160]  And now he's, now he's a friend of the Wahhabis and the jihadis.
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:28.160]  What do you make of Obama saying he's going to veto 9-11 families being able to sue the Saudis when there is a confirmed role in 9-11?
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:33.160]  Well, at the same time, he's going to veto the JASTA bill.
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:41.160]  He wants to push through over a $1 billion military aid package for Saudi Arabia.
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:45.160]  So this guy takes his orders, obviously, from the Saudis.
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:52.160]  And look, I was in, I was in the school in Jakarta where he used to pray to Mecca and recite from the Quran.
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:56.160]  I, in 2011, I don't want to believe that he got taken in.
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:05.160]  But I do believe now that he is a, at least a sympathizer, if not a practicing the Sunni Muslim.
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:07.160]  Another Lawrence of Arabia.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:13.160]  Yeah. And we know why Lawrence of Arabia made common ground with the Saudis.
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:15.160]  He liked to screw little boys.
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:17.160]  Yeah, he was a pedophile.
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:19.160]  He saw, oh, the Saudis are too.
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:28.160]  If that hadn't been the case, Arabia would be under the control of the much more moderate Hashemites today instead of the Saudis.
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:37.160]  Why did British intelligence in 1903 choose that particular tribe of Bedouin caravan robbers?
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:40.160]  I mean, that's who they were to form that empire.
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:42.160]  I mean, why do they choose that group of miscreants?
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:44.160]  Well, two reasons.
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:51.160]  One, I already mentioned T.E. Lawrence, who was well disposed towards pedophilia.
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:53.160]  He saw that the Saudis practiced it as well.
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:15:08.160]  And also they, the British chose the most radical group, the Saudi Wahhabis, because these were, these were Jihadist holy warriors who they knew would bring down the Ottoman Empire, which they helped to do.
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.160]  And that was the beginning of the end for the Middle East.
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:19.160]  We saw the rise of European colonies, which led to nationalism.
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:22.160]  That's right. So they were the destabilizer who wiped stuff up.
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:25.160]  Then the colonists would come in as the saviors after it.
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:27.160]  The Saudis would stand down and give them the area.
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:29.160]  They've been good little agents, haven't they?
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:38.160]  Oh, yeah, they have from the very beginning. And of course, the Saudis were all part of the partitioning of the Arab world at the various...
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:41.160]  What do you make of Flynn? And obviously he represents a larger army movement.
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:44.160]  I mean, I'll give people who obviously the globalists know this, I'm talking about a secret.
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:47.160]  The U.S. Army, which 1775 actually predates the country.
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:49.160]  It's the oldest institution, certainly not perfect.
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:52.160]  You know, where all the bodies are buried is the senior military organization.
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:54.160]  It sees itself as America.
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:16:01.160]  And it certainly is, let's just not say a spring chicken when it comes to things are not perfect.
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:08.160]  But I'm told, and I've seen the intelligence going on, that the army is just very close to kicking the globalist out.
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:15.160]  Just very close. And then you see the real action with them, you know, exposing Obama, leaking stuff, exposing Hillary,
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:17.160]  not going along with the takeover of Syria.
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:22.160]  And it's got other, the Marine Corps halfway involved and some other, you know, grips starting to back it.
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:24.160]  That's got to really scare the globalist.
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:33.160]  Yeah, I think especially when you mention the army, I think the opposition to regime change and getting involved in these are the,
[02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:36.160]  is the group in the army that has to go bear the brunt of this.
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:40.160]  And that's U.S. Army special forces, Green Beret personnel.
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:47.160]  And I think that's where most of the opposition thankfully is coming from because why should they give up their lives?
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:53.160]  Well, you know what's beyond that. They're actually having to train Wahhabists that say, I'm going to kill you next.
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:55.160]  They're giving tow missiles to Al Qaeda.
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:58.160]  They're like, this is too much. We're not doing this.
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:05.160]  Right. And we just saw special forces get thrown out of one Syrian town by our good allies, the Syrian rebels,
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:07.160]  the so-called Free Syrian Army.
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:11.160]  I always said that's a joke. There are no moderate Syrian rebels.
[02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:17.160]  Colonel Schaefer did the classified briefings. I can talk about it because it came out later. But he was on the same day, did the classified briefings.
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:20.160]  And a year later it came out that he was the one leading the briefing.
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:28.160]  And he was there in Congress and they said, listen, it's 98% our Wahhabist funded by Saudi Arabia. There are no real rebels.
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:35.160]  That's why they later came out and said, they spent like $50 million and got four non-Al Qaeda rebels.
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:41.160]  Right. Right. And not only the Saudis, we know the Turks have been involved in that, too.
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:44.160]  And that's, of course, NATO. Turkey's a NATO country.
[02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:48.160]  So we've got our fingerprints all over this mess we created.
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:54.160]  So how much does that shake Hillary up, though? And the globalist to know that the intelligence agencies, everybody's turning against them.
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:57.160]  And I'm not, again, I'm not lionizing them, romanticizing them.
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:01.160]  But the intelligence agencies now realize the plan really is to destroy America.
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:04.160]  And they're having that come to Jesus moment, I think.
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:17.160]  Yeah. And, you know, that Obama speech to the UN was very interesting because he provided clues as to what the priorities will be for the Obama Center and Presidential Library in Chicago.
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:20.160]  And that's transfer our power through the TPP.
[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:27.160]  Yes. Free trade, breaking down borders, mass migration, anti-populism.
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:32.160]  And he said, oh, it's right wing and far left. He included both in that anti-nationalism.
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:36.160]  That's any nationalist that don't agree with foreign people ruling him.
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:39.160]  Absolutely. Good luck winning that fight, Jackass.
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:47.160]  Yeah, that's going to be the focus. This is going to get tons of money from Soros, this center in South Chicago, in Jackson Park.
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:55.160]  And, you know, unlike the Carter Center, which has been monitoring elections, and they're fairly benign.
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:19:02.160]  You've got the Clinton Center, which is basically an extortion and kickback scheme. That's bad enough.
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:09.160]  But this Obama Center is going to be the most active presidential center and library we've seen in history.
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:12.160]  Oh, yeah. You think the Clinton Foundation has been a cancer. Get ready.
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:17.160]  Yeah, yeah. This one will make the Clinton Center look like a daycare center.
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:21.160]  Well, you can tell Obama's excited. He's graduating to the next level of wrecking ball.
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:25.160]  I mean, you think things are bad now? Well, we'll come back and talk about this because this is it, folks.
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:32.160]  But listen, you've got the UK, you've got the U.S., you've got all 25 members of the EU now trying to pull out of the EU.
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:37.160]  You've got the Russians that already pulled out. That's why they're claiming anybody that wants to pull out from this global corporate government is a Russian spy.
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:42.160]  No, we're just agreeing with the Russians. We're not going to be under your butt anymore. They're panicking.
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:46.160]  I don't want to be too optimistic, but this global government looks like it's dead on arrival.
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:48.160]  I don't see how they can put it back together again.
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:52.160]  The problem is they may just destroy the planet in the process of trying to stay in power.
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:55.160]  I'm going to ask Wayne Madsen where he sees all this going straight ahead.
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:19.160]  But I tell you, it's always darkest before the dawn, folks.

[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:32.160]  Bottom line, we would own a real tangible asset and we would have the security of knowing we're protected no matter what the economy does.
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:33.160]  What do you think?
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:36.160]  I think we need to find out how to get our own private storage IRA.
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:59.160]  We need to call the Gold Silver Group right now.

[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:09.160]  We've got a ton of breaking news. It's all coming up in the next segment. This last 30 minutes that I'm hosting, I may have to co-host with Anthony in the fourth hour.
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:20.160]  It's going to be so jam-packed. Zach Galifianakis, the guy from Hangover, a funny comedian. He has a rat leaving the sinking ship. He's really thrown Hillary under the bus, which is a good thing.
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:26.160]  More and more that's happening. Democrats prepare for the fall of Hillary. That's coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:39.160]  I have Hillary, the maniac. Drudge is reporting on her having these breakdowns acting weirder and weirder. That's coming up in the next segment. We're going to premiere that here. It's going to go up on YouTube as well. Not just her latest freak out, but others can posit it together.
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:45.160]  Wayne, you've always got your ear to the ground. A lot of amazing sources when you're up there on Capitol Hill in between there and Virginia and Florida.
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:58.160]  You know, the Secret Service, we have real sources just like you do. You work for M4. Hell, you were there with us in Cleveland. The Secret Service said, hey, we're going to get info in the next few weeks. Well, it took them a month, and it was like she's falling down every hour, sometimes more.
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:09.160]  She's having convulsions. We don't know. Parkinson's, we're not sure. Then the emails came out. Parkinson's and other stuff. Brain tumors. We've got that from medical doctors in Virginia and Maryland. It's going to stop.
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:18.160]  But this is serious business. What is your intel on her and her deterioration and what she's planning to do or where this is going? Other key points, Wayne Madsen?
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:30.160]  Well, I've talked to many medical people. Of course, they all preface this by saying we can't really make a diagnosis without seeing her personally and seeing her records, which we're not going to see.
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:41.160]  But it's almost uniformly they're saying that she's suffering from some sort of neurological seizure issue. Now, whether that's epilepsy or Parkinson's, they don't know.
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:55.160]  But they pointed out that the pneumonia that she has is probably as a result of that epiglottal flap that keeps fluid that should go to the stomach from going into the lungs.
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:26:05.160]  And it was fluid that went into her lower lungs that resulted in the pneumonia. Now, and she takes medication to try to stem that problem.
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:13.160]  But I think I really believe she's going to be pretty well drugged up for the debate.
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:26.160]  So that's my next question. If she can't for a week before show up in person and has to do satellite or Skype appearances to people now, how is she going to be 90 minutes toe to toe live with with Donald Trump?
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:28.160]  I don't think she can make it next week.
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:33.160]  Well, I think she I think she's actually her people are fearing this.
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:43.160]  And look, you know, I think the really the Democrats ought to think of really, you know, it's cruel what they're doing to her.
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:46.160]  Pull her off the ticket, get her medical treatment.
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:52.160]  But I believe that Bill Clinton wants to be the Edith Galt Wilson of this next administration.
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:56.160]  Edith Galt Wilson, of course, was Woodrow Wilson's wife, the first lady.
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:26:58.160]  She ran the country.
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:01.160]  I think Bill Clinton wants to be that same.
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:04.160]  Exactly because Hillary so strong willed she used to run him.
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:06.160]  He's kind of glad she's so sick now.
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:08.160]  This is my chance to finally be president.
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:09.160]  Right, right.
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:11.160]  I think that's what's going to happen.
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:14.160]  I also think this is going to be a very close election.
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:15.160]  And I think we got to look at it.
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:16.160]  It's so close.
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:21.160]  I think we have to look at small states could throw this thing.
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:26.160]  You know, Maine splits up its electoral votes by congressional district.
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:30.160]  That's possibly one vote already for Trump.
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:38.160]  I would also look at these states where they say there's a hidden Trumpocrat electorate,
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:42.160]  particularly states like Rhode Island and New Jersey,
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:48.160]  and especially after the bombings in New Jersey by the Afghani jihadists.
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:55.160]  Look, the people in Jersey are going to not vote thinking about lane closures on the George Washington bridge,
[02:27:55.160 --> 02:27:57.160]  which Democrats are hyping right now.
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:00.160]  They're going to worry about bombing.
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:04.160]  What's wrong with Hillary saying it isn't a bombing in the same Senate saying it's a bombing?
[02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:06.160]  And then saying the Russians, did you hear this?
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:08.160]  Were they saying the Russians are behind it?
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:15.160]  Yeah, well, she's getting this from Huma Abedin, you know, who was sort of her Spengali,
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:17.160]  who tells her look at, you know...
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:18.160]  Her Rasputin.
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:21.160]  Her Rasputin winds her up and, you know...
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:22.160]  Yeah, right.
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:31.160]  Well, I mean, she has this bizarre world view that the people she thinks are the enemies of this United States
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:36.160]  are really our friends, and people who are supposedly, in her view,
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:42.160]  are friends are really our enemies, like the Saudis, like the Turks and these other countries.
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:44.160]  She's really messed up.
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:50.160]  And look, I think, as I said, I think this is going to be a very close election.
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:55.160]  I'm going to boil down to some small states that never really made a difference before.
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:57.160]  It's always been Ohio and Florida.
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:28:59.160]  I would look at Rhode Island.
[02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:02.160]  I would look at that one district in Maine.
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:07.160]  I would look at Delaware, which is now leading Democrat from solid Democrat.
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:08.160]  Look, I think...
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:13.160]  Well, I mean, what does it tell you when she was 27 points ahead in the Google poll for years,
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:16.160]  you know, when she got pulled even before Trump got in?
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:17.160]  You know, the Democrats were always ahead.
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:21.160]  She's only a few points ahead of Trump about to lose the district of criminals.
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:24.160]  I mean, even the District of Columbia, Hillary's about to lose.
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:25.160]  I mean, what does that tell you?
[02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:27.160]  Yeah, she can't...
[02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:32.160]  If she can't account on these three or Rhode Island or Delaware, she's in trouble.
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:34.160]  All right, WayneMadsonReport.com.
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:36.160]  Thanks for coming in with your great questions for William Benny,
[02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:39.160]  former leader, a technical director of the NSA.

[02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:47.160]  It's so good to have folks like that on the team.
[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:48.160]  I'm so proud of that guy.

[02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:51.160]  We're on the march.

[02:52:58.160 --> 02:53:02.160]  Well, I appreciate your concern and also your experience,
[02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:10.160]  but let me try to make the distinctions that I think are important for me to answer your question.
[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:20.160]  First, as I said to Matt, you know, and I know, classified material is designated, it is marked.
[02:53:20.160 --> 02:53:24.160]  There is a header so that there is no dispute at all.
[02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:32.160]  What is being communicated to or from someone who has that access is marked classified.
[02:53:32.160 --> 02:53:44.160]  And what we have here is the use of an unclassified system by hundreds of people in our government to send information that was not marked.
[02:53:44.160 --> 02:53:54.160]  There was no statement, top secret, secret or confidential.
[02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:58.160]  I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system.
[02:53:58.160 --> 02:54:00.160]  I took it very seriously.
[02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:02.160]  A secret system.
[02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:22.160]  I went into one of those little tents that I'm sure you've seen around the world because we didn't want there to be any potential for someone to have embedded a camera to try to see whatever it is that I was designated, marked and headed as classified.
[02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:28.160]  So I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously.
[02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:30.160]  Always have, always will.
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:36.160]  I hope you talk about vice presidential possibility.
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:40.160]  I was scared to talk about vice presidential possibility.
[02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:44.160]  I hope you talk about vice presidential possibility.
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:55:04.160]  I hope you talk about vice presidential possibility.
[02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:14.160]  I hope you talk about vice presidential possibility.
[02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:32.160]  I hope you talk about vice presidential possibility.
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:40.160]  Mommy, oh, thank you, mommy. The planet is ours. Oh, little green goblets.
[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:44.160]  Hillary didn't fall down. Why just look at her fall flat on her face.
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:48.160]  More at nine on CNN. We don't lie. We're the Glutton News Network.
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:54.160]  Look, boom.
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:56:04.160]  Hillary just said she wobbled. She stumbled. She didn't fall down. Those conspiracy theorists, those enemies, lied.
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:08.160]  Hillary's never been stronger. Did you hear she climbed Mount Everest last week?
[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:18.160]  She did, actually. It's true. She climbed it with Jeff Galifonuchus.
[02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:22.160]  Enhanced of the feet behind her being drugged into the vehicle.
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:26.160]  The emblematic fall of the New World Order.
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:38.160]  A portent, an omen, a tea leaf, a rune, a signet, a symbol, a sign, a star.
[02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:42.160]  The scum of the globalists will rule no one.
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:52.160]  She's coming up saying she's fine. No one's around her. No one's locked off her child, runs up to hug her.
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:57:02.160]  It's not stage. We don't lie. You can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:04.160]  Right?
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:12.160]  The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic. You name it.
[02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:14.160]  Hillary for President!
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:22.160]  Installing half a billion solar panels. Building a cleaner, more resilient electric grid.
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:24.160]  Now hold you back.
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:32.160]  But as you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof, and debt keeps piling up.
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:40.160]  Boy, we have 16 three days to go.
[02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:48.160]  It's 46 now sweetheart. That day she was in the tent for 45.
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:50.160]  Enough.
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:54.160]  A four year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America.
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:58:00.160]  About how hard it is to balance the demands of her and her family in today's economy.
[02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:06.160]  Families look different today than they did decades ago. I think we can all agree.
[02:58:06.160 --> 02:58:10.160]  Most need two incomes just to get by.
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:16.160]  It's in bargain collectively, and I will fight back against so-called right to work.
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:20.160]  Right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America.
[02:58:20.160 --> 02:58:22.160]  She's clearly nuts in this last video.
[02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:24.160]  Now I haven't said all this. Why aren't I 50 points ahead you might ask?
[02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:26.160]  Who is this new woman?
[02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:28.160]  Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer.
[02:58:28.160 --> 02:58:30.160]  Look at the alien.
[02:58:30.160 --> 02:58:36.160]  I need your help to get Donald Trump's record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.
[02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:40.160]  We'll be back with the rest of it. I mean she is whacked out of her gourd.
[02:58:40.160 --> 02:58:42.160]  Fourth hour coming up in FullWars.com.
[02:58:42.160 --> 02:58:46.160]  Some of our fillies don't carry it. We love them. Support them.

[02:59:48.160 --> 02:59:55.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:18.160 --> 03:00:23.160]  The world. Another time.
[03:00:23.160 --> 03:00:28.160]  Slap was green and good until the crystal cracked.
[03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:33.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:40.160]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:45.160]  So we're receiving this transmission. You are watching Hillary Clinton rot on the vine.
[03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:48.160]  In the front of everyone.
[03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:54.160]  Metaphysically, a mirror image like the portrait of Mr. Gray
[03:00:54.160 --> 03:01:01.160]  showing the inward evil projecting itself out into the third dimension.
[03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:05.160]  It was a point I wanted to get to with William Benning earlier on how to defeat the technocracy
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:09.160]  that's voting with our dollars. Google glasses failed and they had
[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:13.160]  billions of dollars pushing that. People didn't like it.
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:17.160]  It was something that hooked into humanity good. It didn't work well.
[03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:23.160]  It was nauseating. Both spiritually and physically.
[03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:27.160]  And they come out as con artists and say, you will just accept
[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:31.160]  driverless cars and okay, the feds do plan to just make everybody in the next 5 or 10 years
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:35.160]  get out of your car and okay, we're going to do it. How about we just don't comply?
[03:01:35.160 --> 03:01:39.160]  They all just con artists and say, you'll all accept Google glasses. This is going to replace the Internet.
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:43.160]  Driverless cars just accept it. But you know what?
[03:01:43.160 --> 03:01:47.160]  I'm not going to take baseball bats and driverless cars when I see them.
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:51.160]  They usually double as little mobile spy centers to steal your data.
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:55.160]  I'm going to find out who's in business with them and I'm going to boycott them.
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:59.160]  And we're going to be launching next week
[03:01:59.160 --> 03:02:03.160]  a major global movement against the technocracy.
[03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:07.160]  We're going to crowd source. I just want to come out with a symbol. I'm coming out with a symbol.
[03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:11.160]  We've got a better one of products
[03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:15.160]  having a marking on them that means humans were involved in its cultivation, development, and delivery.
[03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:19.160]  I'm not going to buy any products that were not
[03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:23.160]  delivered by a human driver and loaded by humans.
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:27.160]  You say, well, that's in the way of progress. I'd all be for driverless cars
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:31.160]  if the globalist didn't say it was about getting rid of humans in the chain of development
[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:35.160]  and building a world that isn't based on us. I want to build a world based on
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:39.160]  making things better for us, not making us obsolete because the elite think they're a bunch of gods.
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:43.160]  You're not a god, Hillary. You're not a god, Bezos. You're not a god,
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:47.160]  Schmidt. You're not a god, any of you people.
[03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:51.160]  If you want humanity to get out of the way
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:55.160]  stick a gun in your mouth and blow your own damn head off.
[03:02:55.160 --> 03:02:59.160]  I don't wish any harm against you, but stop wishing harm on us.
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:03.160]  You are a bunch of trash raised by your
[03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:07.160]  class wife parents and you've had everything your whole life and you have no soul
[03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:11.160]  to just get out of our way trash. I see you.
[03:03:11.160 --> 03:03:15.160]  You're husk.
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:19.160]  You want me to die?
[03:03:19.160 --> 03:03:23.160]  Not going to happen.
[03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:27.160]  By me physically dying, I don't care about this body. I'm saying I'm not
[03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:31.160]  going to join the forces of death and just roll over in some ditch for you.
[03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:35.160]  Understand cupcake. Let's finish up this clip of Hillary.
[03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:39.160]  Here's the end of it where she had her latest little psycho event today.
[03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:43.160]  Couldn't even speak proper English. Here it is. It's talking like a two year old.
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:47.160]  That's her spirit. Little demons about that smart. She says
[03:03:47.160 --> 03:03:51.160]  why aren't I 50 points ahead? Here she is.
[03:03:51.160 --> 03:03:55.160]  It's in bargain collectively and I will fight back against so called
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:59.160]  right to work. Right to work is wrong for workers
[03:03:59.160 --> 03:04:03.160]  and wrong for America. Now having said all this,
[03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:07.160]  why aren't I 50 points ahead you might ask. Well
[03:04:07.160 --> 03:04:11.160]  the choice for working families has never been clearer.
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:15.160]  I need your help to get Donald Trump's
[03:04:15.160 --> 03:04:19.160]  She's on the toilet in her hospital room. Nobody should be fooled.
[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:23.160]  He proudly declared himself 100% right to work.
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:27.160]  That is blue screen. I mean I don't know if she's on a toilet.
[03:04:27.160 --> 03:04:31.160]  He's organizing campaign at his hotel in Las Vegas
[03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:35.160]  where you are right now. And he built up
[03:04:35.160 --> 03:04:39.160]  a union sucking off of it. I'm stiffing small businesses and contractors.
[03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:43.160]  That goes against everything we stand for as a country. My dad was a small
[03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:47.160]  business. I'm a business man. I'm just happy never to business with Trump.
[03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:51.160]  Estee Fall she boarded her plane yesterday. Clinton was leading Yemen.
[03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:55.160]  This is the heart of 1777.
[03:04:55.160 --> 03:04:59.160]  Stay with me. I'm going to continue broadcasting.
[03:04:59.160 --> 03:05:03.160]  Hillary didn't come to Charlotte. She didn't see what happened. Instead of
[03:05:03.160 --> 03:05:07.160]  playing a calming role as a leader should, Hillary chose to act as a
[03:05:07.160 --> 03:05:11.160]  demagogue inciting violence by her tweet, hurling racism charges
[03:05:11.160 --> 03:05:15.160]  like a Molotov cocktail. Hillary tweeted out another
[03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:19.160]  unarmed black man was shot in a police incident. She called it intolerable.
[03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:23.160]  But a witness photographed the man with the gun, cooperating the police version of what
[03:05:23.160 --> 03:05:27.160]  happened, that he was armed and ignored repeated verbal commands to drop his handgun.
[03:05:27.160 --> 03:05:31.160]  Hillary saying an unarmed black man has been shot again was a dog whistle
[03:05:31.160 --> 03:05:35.160]  for black lives matter to get whitey. Even though it was a black cop who shot
[03:05:35.160 --> 03:05:39.160]  the black man, working for a black police chief in a city run by Democrats.
[03:05:39.160 --> 03:05:43.160]  Now we have seen fires, doors looted, white people dragged, beaten, begging
[03:05:43.160 --> 03:05:47.160]  for mercy. Yet even as these facts and photos emerge, Hillary
[03:05:47.160 --> 03:05:51.160]  refuses to walk back the statement or to try to calm the situation.
[03:05:51.160 --> 03:05:55.160]  Thanks, Hillary. I guess rioters and looters are stronger together.
[03:05:55.160 --> 03:05:59.160]  One thing's for sure, they're with her. Friend4wars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:05:59.160 --> 03:06:03.160]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you know
[03:06:03.160 --> 03:06:07.160]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking
[03:06:07.160 --> 03:06:11.160]  statistics. Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care nearly $10,000
[03:06:11.160 --> 03:06:15.160]  per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes,
[03:06:15.160 --> 03:06:19.160]  cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three
[03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:23.160]  or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person
[03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:27.160]  with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy
[03:06:27.160 --> 03:06:31.160]  and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way

[03:06:59.160 --> 03:07:03.160]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so
[03:07:03.160 --> 03:07:07.160]  good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much
[03:07:07.160 --> 03:07:11.160]  scares me the most. I mean I try to make sure that I
[03:07:11.160 --> 03:07:15.160]  don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but
[03:07:15.160 --> 03:07:19.160]  right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything
[03:07:19.160 --> 03:07:23.160]  that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now
[03:07:23.160 --> 03:07:27.160]  with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological

[03:08:51.160 --> 03:08:55.160]  The fight.
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:59.160]  Alright I want to hand it to Tony. I think it's yardic because I've got a lot to get
[03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:03.160]  done today for Nightly News and preparations for next Monday. The historic
[03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:07.160]  debate. We're going to have coverage the hour before. Live. We're going to actually carry the
[03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:11.160]  feeds. We're going to actually just carry the feed and not just have commentary over it. Very
[03:09:11.160 --> 03:09:21.160]  very exciting. And we're going to have a breakdown of several hours after with your phone calls
[03:09:21.160 --> 03:09:27.160]  and more. I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. I know tomorrow too I will be but 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:09:27.160 --> 03:09:32.160]  Central with the Sunday transmission. I'll be live this weekend. I'm live a lot of weekends
[03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:36.160]  or David and I come in sometimes when I'm evil and actually take off for the weekend.
[03:09:36.160 --> 03:09:40.160]  But I tell you I mean I end up working on Saturdays too just because wild horses
[03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:44.160]  couldn't drag me away. We're going to see a lot of false flags and we've asked what
[03:09:44.160 --> 03:09:48.160]  are they going to do to start a race war? Well yeah they've come in and tripled down
[03:09:48.160 --> 03:09:52.160]  with hundreds of millions from the Ford Foundation and Soros to the communist
[03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:56.160]  organizations in Black Lives Matter and others where a black cop shoots a black
[03:09:56.160 --> 03:10:01.160]  man with a gun and Hillary tweets out another black man killed by white police
[03:10:01.160 --> 03:10:07.160]  with a gun. Another unarmed black man killed by the police and it just wasn't true.
[03:10:07.160 --> 03:10:12.160]  Now you got the other case with this poor gentleman in Tulsa killed by a white
[03:10:12.160 --> 03:10:16.160]  female cop who just choked and killed him. I've got that Trump clip I want to play but I want to finish
[03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:20.160]  these clips first because I mentioned them. We're going to play first
[03:10:20.160 --> 03:10:24.160]  Key Clamont Scott's brother the guy that had the gun and got killed by the black
[03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:29.160]  officer in North Carolina in Charlotte calls all white people devils. Then black
[03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:34.160]  thugs beat up white man in Charlotte as he begs for no reason and MSNBC claims
[03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:38.160]  Black Lives Matter riders are peaceful. If this wasn't so serious this is some
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:42.160]  really good comedy. I mean this is this is really good. Then we have
[03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:48.160]  Trump coming out we have that clip. Trump coming out saying that you know he's got
[03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:51.160]  some really serious questions about what happened and thinks the lady chokes and
[03:10:51.160 --> 03:10:56.160]  it was wrong what happened with this crusher gentleman whose cars broke down
[03:10:56.160 --> 03:11:00.160]  the cop shop freak out. There's a lot of hype going on here and it's a big black
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:04.160]  guy he may try to kill us but that's all Black Lives Matter in this hype. I'm not
[03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:08.160]  saying what she did is right and she's getting in trouble but it's like the cops
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:11.160]  crime rates are exploding. Chicago already had the highest crime rate in the world.
[03:11:11.160 --> 03:11:17.160]  It's now doubled that in two years thousands dying a year. A couple hundred people get
[03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:22.160]  killed total by cops you know quote in false shootings every year it's a thousand
[03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:27.160]  total. So the point is this is a triumph of hype over reality so let's go through
[03:11:27.160 --> 03:11:32.160]  these clips. Here is a Keith Lamont who looks like he's really enjoying all the
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:36.160]  hype. It's like you know it's this new party time to just come out and you know
[03:11:36.160 --> 03:11:40.160]  sit there in a city with a you know with a black police chief and a black city
[03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:45.160]  and just and just say it's all the white people that have weirdo white people
[03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:49.160]  out there with signs saying white people did this. I mean he really gets old man
[03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:53.160]  so let's play this clip. Is there anything we should know?
[03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:57.160]  Just know that all white people are f***ing devils.
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:12:00.160]  And make sure you hear that one.
[03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:04.160]  All white cops are f***ing devils and white people.
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:09.160]  Devils. I think we're all kind of devils I mean at least we have that part in us
[03:12:09.160 --> 03:12:12.160]  but okay I agree it's only white people that ever do anything wrong I get it.
[03:12:12.160 --> 03:12:16.160]  That's why 95% of the crime in Chicago is black on black thousands dead a year
[03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:21.160]  but just you know forget it. Doesn't matter you know let's say cops you know kill
[03:12:21.160 --> 03:12:25.160]  100-something black people a year let's say half of it's you know wrong.
[03:12:25.160 --> 03:12:28.160]  100 people it's wrong okay I'm sure there's some bad cops.
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:31.160]  I mean just it's all I ever hear about it's like there's no businesses there's no
[03:12:31.160 --> 03:12:35.160]  future there's no culture there's no nothing it's just b***h you complain all day
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:39.160]  that the cops are out to get you. And it's like you own something when you
[03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:45.160]  you have a you know a victimology oh I'm people are putting me down oh I don't know
[03:12:45.160 --> 03:12:48.160]  you know like these sports players I only make a hundred million dollars on my contract
[03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:52.160]  and 10 million a year on sponsors you have the white people like the white people
[03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:58.160]  that adopted me when I was a kid and put me through college and they're evil.
[03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:06.160]  I'm sorry let's go to black thugs beat up white devil as he begs the begging is
[03:13:06.160 --> 03:13:10.160]  the best part this is a go this is the racial assaults that are just epic right now
[03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:13.160]  in Charlotte where Joe Biggs will be reporting tonight here it is.
[03:13:13.160 --> 03:13:21.160]  Now if you have eight white guys beating a black person it'd be big news that it'd be
[03:13:21.160 --> 03:13:25.160]  riots nationwide but but because collectively all whites would be involved but no no no
[03:13:25.160 --> 03:13:28.160]  black people will attack a white devil it's okay.
[03:13:28.160 --> 03:13:31.160]  I know this person is begging.
[03:13:31.160 --> 03:13:33.160]  Please.
[03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:38.160]  Okay you just need to start packing let's continue here let's go to the next one
[03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:42.160]  MSNBC claims black lives matter writers are peaceful kind of like when they had
[03:13:42.160 --> 03:13:48.160]  ISIS al-Qaeda Muslim brotherhood overthrow Egypt and killed tens of thousands of Christians
[03:13:48.160 --> 03:13:56.160]  and blow up every church in the country it was good seeing it said so so our
[03:13:56.160 --> 03:14:00.160]  rather issue with the computer so many of these clips and then we've got Trump coming
[03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:07.160]  up as well but while we cue that up let's go ahead and play Trump talking about the
[03:14:07.160 --> 03:14:12.160]  real situation where a guy's car breaks down he's got doesn't have a criminal record
[03:14:12.160 --> 03:14:16.160]  he's got four or five kids he's a Christian guy the cops he puts his hands up they just
[03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:20.160]  kill him.
[03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:25.160]  Trump very troubled Oklahoma fatal police shooting and they've got some leftist police
[03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:29.160]  chiefs coming out being screwballs you know saying he's wrong so it's okay when they
[03:14:29.160 --> 03:14:33.160]  blame white people or whatever for the black cop of the black police chief shooting an
[03:14:33.160 --> 03:14:37.160]  armed black guy that's okay when the left doesn't one Trump says this looks pretty damn
[03:14:37.160 --> 03:14:41.160]  bad we shouldn't have cops that choke he says there's still gonna always be problems
[03:14:41.160 --> 03:14:46.160]  that's nothing nothing's gonna be perfect but but again you got a real issue why do
[03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:50.160]  these black lives matter people always pick a place where they're in the wrong
[03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:54.160]  because it's globalist run to never give them a legitimate issue and double cross
[03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:58.160]  the inner city blacks you name it later with the police state they're being set up
[03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:02.160]  they're the useful idiots like all of us here's Donald Trump
[03:15:02.160 --> 03:15:13.160]  watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa and that man was hands up that man
[03:15:13.160 --> 03:15:20.160]  went to the car hands up put his hand on the car I mean to me it looked like he
[03:15:20.160 --> 03:15:27.160]  did everything he's supposed to do and he looked like a really good man and
[03:15:27.160 --> 03:15:31.160]  maybe I'm a little clouded because I saw his family talking about him after the
[03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:35.160]  fact so you get a little bit you know different image maybe but to me he looked
[03:15:35.160 --> 03:15:41.160]  like a you know somebody that was doing what they were asking him to do and this
[03:15:41.160 --> 03:15:47.160]  young officer I don't know what she was thinking I don't know what she was
[03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:53.160]  thinking but I'm very very troubled by that I'm very very troubled by that and we
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:16:00.160]  have to be very very concerned so there you know there's Trump laying in all
[03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:04.160]  out the videos on info wars for some reason it's a corrupted file it won't
[03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:08.160]  play that with computers sometimes you think we're like editing videos I do too
[03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:11.160]  they just kind of shudder and mess up sometimes they just are corrupted it's
[03:16:11.160 --> 03:16:15.160]  weird you gotta download them like eight times before they work that one doesn't
[03:16:15.160 --> 03:16:19.160]  work but the clip is on info wars dot com of MSNBC claims black lives matter
[03:16:19.160 --> 03:16:23.160]  writers are peaceful but they call them demonstrators this is like an exercise
[03:16:23.160 --> 03:16:26.160]  and being chumped Anthony it's you already it just gets crazier and crazier
[03:16:26.160 --> 03:16:30.160]  crazier what do you make of all this well this is what happens when the media gives
[03:16:30.160 --> 03:16:33.160]  people a license to do whatever they want because they make excuses right so if
[03:16:33.160 --> 03:16:38.160]  the rioters in a char let go out and they do something like beat up a white
[03:16:38.160 --> 03:16:42.160]  person who's screaming for his life well they say that the rioters are peaceful
[03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:45.160]  and they're peaceful or try to throw people in fires or attack reporters they
[03:16:45.160 --> 03:16:48.160]  deserve it because they are evil exactly right so they're but they're peaceful
[03:16:48.160 --> 03:16:52.160]  and when the media is apologetic for everything you do you have a license
[03:16:52.160 --> 03:16:56.160]  it's like if you look throughout history a lot of the times people would go into
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:17:00.160]  movements and in so-called revolutions right and they would initially not
[03:17:00.160 --> 03:17:03.160]  really want to do anything but they realize the establishment system at that
[03:17:03.160 --> 03:17:06.160]  time was behind them so they had a license to do whatever they want why
[03:17:06.160 --> 03:17:11.160]  wouldn't they go around and smash in cop cars and smash other cars the media
[03:17:11.160 --> 03:17:15.160]  the government George Soros they all want this to happen and so people feel
[03:17:15.160 --> 03:17:18.160]  like this is their time to shine is their time to get attention when they're
[03:17:18.160 --> 03:17:23.160]  actually setting everybody up including themselves well and they forget that
[03:17:23.160 --> 03:17:26.160]  real people are actually watching and thinking that they're completely insane
[03:17:26.160 --> 03:17:32.160]  when they say things like someone the entire race is devils right so people
[03:17:32.160 --> 03:17:36.160]  with actual brains are watching this and realizing how absurd it is but when
[03:17:36.160 --> 03:17:40.160]  you have what seems to be such a mighty force of the establishment behind you
[03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:44.160]  when MSNBC says you're peaceful and everything's fine then you feel entitled
[03:17:44.160 --> 03:17:48.160]  to do that you feel like you should do something like we are peaceful that's
[03:17:48.160 --> 03:17:52.160]  right it's a just self-justification of delusion where it's like you know what
[03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:56.160]  it is peaceful you know why because they deserve it as white people did this to
[03:17:56.160 --> 03:17:59.160]  us or whatever I mean it would just be equally as insane as a white person to
[03:17:59.160 --> 03:18:04.160]  say black people did this I mean it's totally totally delusional but they
[03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:07.160]  let it happen when the media just says things like they're fine they're peaceful
[03:18:07.160 --> 03:18:11.160]  and they do whatever they want I'm going to show TV viewers that they're listening
[03:18:11.160 --> 03:18:15.160]  they're eyewitness photographs show Keith Scott handgun during Charlotte police
[03:18:15.160 --> 03:18:19.160]  shooting by a police officer who's black and then if you look at it there's
[03:18:19.160 --> 03:18:23.160]  video stills where he has the gun there's shots of him with the gun in his hand
[03:18:23.160 --> 03:18:29.160]  and what happened there so again we've all run into power-tripping cops we've
[03:18:29.160 --> 03:18:33.160]  all run into power-tripping bouncers but you know you walk in a bar or whatever
[03:18:33.160 --> 03:18:35.160]  this man was in college you know most of the bouncers weren't starting to fight
[03:18:35.160 --> 03:18:39.160]  with you are there some bad bouncers absolutely are there some bad cops
[03:18:39.160 --> 03:18:43.160]  or bad governments you bet are the cops bad North Korea you bet they are I've
[03:18:43.160 --> 03:18:47.160]  been trying to keep our cops from becoming authoritarian yeah let's talk
[03:18:47.160 --> 03:18:52.160]  about that for a minute if anybody should be oh anti-cop or whatever it should
[03:18:52.160 --> 03:18:56.160]  theoretically be you right I mean how many times have you been attacked by
[03:18:56.160 --> 03:19:00.160]  police when we were in Dallas they were throwing people up the sheriff's department
[03:19:00.160 --> 03:19:04.160]  they were attacking us and punching you and it's not like though we're going to
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:07.160]  sit here and say all cops are horrible they're terrible yeah there are bad cops
[03:19:07.160 --> 03:19:12.160]  well they were ordered by the Democrat Party run sheriff El Goblo or whatever
[03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:16.160]  name is to go after us right but the thing is it would be silly to say all
[03:19:16.160 --> 03:19:19.160]  cops are bad because of some bad instances yeah if the Klan goes out and
[03:19:19.160 --> 03:19:22.160]  kills some poor black person we don't then say all white people are doing it
[03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:26.160]  exactly and even if the cop is bad why why blame because it's about the
[03:19:26.160 --> 03:19:29.160]  Biden conquer Anthony you go ahead and take over my friend great job not only

[03:24:16.160 --> 03:24:31.160]  people are the devil and attack white people it is a silly notion right
[03:24:31.160 --> 03:24:35.160]  because yeah sure there are bad cops and I've experienced them I went to the
[03:24:35.160 --> 03:24:40.160]  NSA and got arrested by the NSA police who told me that their dog their
[03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:45.160]  military German Shepherd was going to bite my testicles off okay I've
[03:24:45.160 --> 03:24:50.160]  I've experienced the bad side so-called bad side of law enforcement right but
[03:24:50.160 --> 03:24:54.160]  I've also experienced amazing law enforcement officers I've also had
[03:24:54.160 --> 03:24:58.160]  bad experiences with different groups of people from different places and
[03:24:58.160 --> 03:25:02.160]  different belief systems but that doesn't mean I chastise and attack
[03:25:02.160 --> 03:25:05.160]  every single one of them that belong to that group right so it's total
[03:25:05.160 --> 03:25:10.160]  ridiculousness now we got a lot of news here and one of the things I want to
[03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:15.160]  talk about is this Saudi Arabia deal but we're going to talk about how Mark
[03:25:15.160 --> 03:25:19.160]  Zuckerberg aims to cure prevent and manage all disease so he has this idea
[03:25:19.160 --> 03:25:23.160]  he thinks he's going to cure and manage all disease Chinese hackers take over
[03:25:23.160 --> 03:25:27.160]  moving Tesla from 12 miles away which demonstrates how easy it is to take
[03:25:27.160 --> 03:25:31.160]  over vehicles they're actually driving and they break and they smash and
[03:25:31.160 --> 03:25:36.160]  like think about the implications of that and young Britain's living in
[03:25:36.160 --> 03:25:41.160]  an expanded adulthood over 40% are still living with their parents under 30
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:47.160]  and a lot more but first what I wanted to talk about is it's kind of like the
[03:25:47.160 --> 03:25:52.160]  system right now is kind of like a realtor showing you a house and you go
[03:25:52.160 --> 03:25:56.160]  into this house it's a nice beautiful big house it seems and you go in and
[03:25:56.160 --> 03:26:00.160]  there's like a wall that's just totally crumbled in the back and there's
[03:26:00.160 --> 03:26:03.160]  roaches running around and stuff and they're like well don't look at that
[03:26:03.160 --> 03:26:06.160]  that's not what you need to look at look over there look over there there's a
[03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:09.160]  there's a scratch in the bathroom that's kind of we'll take care of that
[03:26:09.160 --> 03:26:13.160]  that's the ridiculousness right now when you see Hillary Clinton and you see
[03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:18.160]  any politician talk about things like women's rights or gender equality or
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:22.160]  racism when they're forgetting that the wall is completely destroyed and
[03:26:22.160 --> 03:26:26.160]  crumbled in the back that's what I want to talk about so this article US lawmakers
[03:26:26.160 --> 03:26:31.160]  failed to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia okay so billions of dollars of
[03:26:31.160 --> 03:26:37.160]  weapons sent to Saudi Arabia senators they voted 71 to 27 to kill legislation
[03:26:37.160 --> 03:26:40.160]  that would have stopped the sale all right we support Saudi Arabia Hillary
[03:26:40.160 --> 03:26:46.160]  love Saudi Arabia but gender equality and neutrality is good now I brought
[03:26:46.160 --> 03:26:50.160]  Margaret in here because I want to go in over some articles with her and we were
[03:26:50.160 --> 03:26:53.160]  talking about this earlier so she's going to join us for the segment Margaret
[03:26:53.160 --> 03:26:58.160]  Howell and we're going to talk about how friendly Saudi Arabia is I've got some
[03:26:58.160 --> 03:27:04.160]  articles over here because you see I actually do care about human empowerment
[03:27:04.160 --> 03:27:09.160]  and human empowerment also pertains to females who would have thought right and
[03:27:09.160 --> 03:27:14.160]  female empowerment is important it is good it is actually essential if we're
[03:27:14.160 --> 03:27:19.160]  going to do anything with our life right so what's funny though isn't it funny
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:24.160]  that they talk about all of this while supporting Saudi Arabia while saying
[03:27:24.160 --> 03:27:28.160]  nothing about the injustices while saying nothing about so many different
[03:27:28.160 --> 03:27:32.160]  injustices with about women that we should actually talk about such as nine
[03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:36.160]  things women can't do in Saudi Arabia how about talk about some gender equality
[03:27:36.160 --> 03:27:42.160]  here drive a car there's no official law that bans women from driving but deeply
[03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:47.160]  held religious beliefs for habit interact with men wear clothes go for a swim
[03:27:47.160 --> 03:27:52.160]  compete freely in sports does that sound like a quality to you you know it does
[03:27:52.160 --> 03:27:56.160]  I mean that just sounds like perfection in heaven on earth not being able to
[03:27:56.160 --> 03:28:01.160]  interact with men drive a car or swim of course not of course that's grossly
[03:28:01.160 --> 03:28:08.160]  an equal and you know we're talking about archaic people I'm sorry but we're
[03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:12.160]  talking about a way of life this extreme Wahhabism I've reported from the
[03:28:12.160 --> 03:28:16.160]  Middle East never from Saudi Arabia but there is a there is an oppressive
[03:28:16.160 --> 03:28:20.160]  feeling in the air if you're a woman walking out in public showing your hair
[03:28:20.160 --> 03:28:24.160]  in a westerner I mean yeah I don't think it's just in the air I mean you can't
[03:28:24.160 --> 03:28:27.160]  interact with men you cannot interact with women are required to limit the amount
[03:28:27.160 --> 03:28:33.160]  of time spent with men to whom they are not related okay wear clothes or makeup
[03:28:33.160 --> 03:28:38.160]  and then then this washington post article that I found on page three of
[03:28:38.160 --> 03:28:42.160]  this it says the facts and few myths about Saudi Arabia and human rights
[03:28:42.160 --> 03:28:46.160]  okay and remember politicians in the United States telling you you're bad
[03:28:46.160 --> 03:28:51.160]  I'm going to point at you in the camera you're bad okay you are bad because you
[03:28:51.160 --> 03:28:55.160]  use terms that could offend someone you say male and female you're against
[03:28:55.160 --> 03:29:00.160]  gender equality you're bad oh but listen to this though it says hey you know
[03:29:00.160 --> 03:29:05.160]  while Saudi Arabia is dominated by ultra-conservative sunny ideology an
[03:29:05.160 --> 03:29:09.160]  estimated 15% of the country's Muslims are Shiite they say they face discrimination
[03:29:09.160 --> 03:29:14.160]  but you know don't worry it says it says some of them some of the areas are
[03:29:14.160 --> 03:29:18.160]  actually more liberal it says in more liberal areas of the country such as
[03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:24.160]  Jida or Jida the dress code for women is relatively relaxed how is it relaxed
[03:29:24.160 --> 03:29:29.160]  brightly covered abayas can be worn or sometimes the cloak is worn to show the
[03:29:29.160 --> 03:29:33.160]  clothes underneath oh sometimes you can show the clothes you're wearing and
[03:29:33.160 --> 03:29:37.160]  while they can't you know women can't legally drive without licenses some
[03:29:37.160 --> 03:29:41.160]  women and women in the southern provinces Austin are allowed to drive
[03:29:41.160 --> 03:29:47.160]  sometime so it's more liberal it says more relaxed so it's okay that is a
[03:29:47.160 --> 03:29:53.160]  quality and Saudi Arabia is a human rights the empire is in the run Alex Jones
[03:29:53.160 --> 03:30:14.160]  and the GCN radio network

[03:33:48.160 --> 03:33:52.160]  about Charlotte up here in a couple minutes bizarre message plays on hacked

[03:33:58.160 --> 03:34:02.160]  seriously freaky a man driving on the New Jersey turnpike recorded a bizarre
[03:34:02.160 --> 03:34:08.160]  radio message that repeatedly stated the words quote Trump will go 26 leading
[03:34:08.160 --> 03:34:12.160]  some to speculate that the station had been hacked a YouTube clip features the
[03:34:12.160 --> 03:34:16.160]  weird voice playing over and over again as the driver expresses his bafflement
[03:34:16.160 --> 03:34:19.160]  what is this he asked turning the story off before turning it back on and hearing
[03:34:19.160 --> 03:34:24.160]  the message once again so he knows what that is could be a total scam could be
[03:34:24.160 --> 03:34:32.160]  some devil threat here let's listen

[03:35:51.160 --> 03:35:57.160]  says 43 but feeling 21 from Dr. P from Connecticut says seemingly impossible
[03:35:57.160 --> 03:36:02.160]  results in minimal time working 80 to 90 hours a week I was beginning to feel
[03:36:02.160 --> 03:36:06.160]  down two weeks of taping taking supermail vitality and I feel the energy

[03:36:10.160 --> 03:36:15.160]  through a third party review website all vetted all legit on infowarslife.com
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:19.160]  and supermail vitality its last chance to get it for 20% off support and

[03:36:23.160 --> 03:36:30.160]  for you and works so win-win also skin some news now so when I talk about
[03:36:30.160 --> 03:36:35.160]  things like Saudi Arabia I talk about Saudi Arabia's vast injustice and the
[03:36:35.160 --> 03:36:40.160]  fact that they cut limbs off as a form of punishment or the fact they kill you
[03:36:40.160 --> 03:36:45.160]  even if you use words like democracy or freedom or something they can come after
[03:36:45.160 --> 03:36:49.160]  you and actually sever your fingers or lash you or something okay does that
[03:36:49.160 --> 03:36:57.160]  mean that I'm anti-muslim no when I talk about writers in Charlotte beating up
[03:36:57.160 --> 03:37:00.160]  a white person because he's white or saying that all white people are the
[03:37:00.160 --> 03:37:06.160]  devil does that mean I'm a racist no and I will not conform to the ideological
[03:37:06.160 --> 03:37:11.160]  prison of political correctness which is actually complete BS see I'm not in
[03:37:11.160 --> 03:37:16.160]  that gate I'm not in the the paradigm in which I have to conform to fake
[03:37:16.160 --> 03:37:22.160]  ideological standards and word domination cast upon me by the media system
[03:37:22.160 --> 03:37:25.160]  that thinks they're in control when they're not I'm not actually going to do
[03:37:25.160 --> 03:37:29.160]  it because there's a key to your cell and it's sitting right here I'm I am long
[03:37:29.160 --> 03:37:32.160]  out of my cell so I'm not going to conform to that and that's why I'm going
[03:37:32.160 --> 03:37:37.160]  to talk about this the United Arab Emirates is going to start taking in
[03:37:37.160 --> 03:37:43.160]  Syrian refugees so this was on a bunch of news sites this morning the Emirates
[03:37:43.160 --> 03:37:47.160]  will begin welcoming refugees over the next five years in a major shift the
[03:37:47.160 --> 03:37:51.160]  UAE has announced that it will take in 15,000 Syrian refugees over the next
[03:37:51.160 --> 03:37:56.160]  five years says currently around 250,000 Syrians live in the UAE but none of
[03:37:56.160 --> 03:38:00.160]  them have refugee status and I saw in the comments that this was being
[03:38:00.160 --> 03:38:04.160]  celebrated like oh I'm so happy that they're taking in these refugees you
[03:38:04.160 --> 03:38:09.160]  know Saudi Arabia has like tents cities with hundreds of thousands of empty
[03:38:09.160 --> 03:38:12.160]  tents they could live in but you know people are saying oh this is so good
[03:38:12.160 --> 03:38:18.160]  right now if you go on to Reddit which is a great open source style website it's
[03:38:18.160 --> 03:38:22.160]  really just human beings talking and commenting on things I came across
[03:38:22.160 --> 03:38:26.160]  some interesting comments that were among the top voted up by thousands of
[03:38:26.160 --> 03:38:31.160]  other users now of course this is just someone's writings that have not been
[03:38:31.160 --> 03:38:36.160]  100% shown but I'll tell you what these are based on a lot of news stories so
[03:38:36.160 --> 03:38:39.160]  you look at that story and you say oh that's so great they're taking in the
[03:38:39.160 --> 03:38:42.160]  refugees but the problem is again we actually have to investigate things we
[03:38:42.160 --> 03:38:46.160]  have to look further and here's just some comments from people that are really
[03:38:46.160 --> 03:38:50.160]  deep from people that have lived in Dubai and know what it's like this one is
[03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:56.160]  from media-n on Reddit says in the UAE unless your father is an Emirati you are
[03:38:56.160 --> 03:39:00.160]  not an Emirati and will never be a citizen there what many of these rich
[03:39:00.160 --> 03:39:04.160]  Arab countries do is they have generation and generations of Syrians living in
[03:39:04.160 --> 03:39:07.160]  their country but no matter how long they've been there no matter if they're
[03:39:07.160 --> 03:39:10.160]  born there their parents born there their grandparents born there they will
[03:39:10.160 --> 03:39:14.160]  never be Emirati and always be Syrian always second-class citizens many
[03:39:14.160 --> 03:39:18.160]  labors and many are treated like pure garbage these numbers are inflated
[03:39:18.160 --> 03:39:22.160]  heavily due to the fact they count people as Syrian even though perhaps no one
[03:39:22.160 --> 03:39:25.160]  in their family has ever been to Syria leading all the way back to the grandparents
[03:39:25.160 --> 03:39:30.160]  the UAE just doesn't want to dilute their purity and no one is ever allowed to
[03:39:30.160 --> 03:39:35.160]  become a citizen unless they are of pure blood I lived in Dubai for a while
[03:39:35.160 --> 03:39:38.160]  you want to know what a very racist society feels like go live in Dubai or
[03:39:38.160 --> 03:39:42.160]  Qatar or Bahrain where your skin color your ethnicity decides your social
[03:39:42.160 --> 03:39:47.160]  status yeah you know people people seem to forget because because remember the
[03:39:47.160 --> 03:39:50.160]  house the realtor is telling us this house and there's a collapsed wall in the
[03:39:50.160 --> 03:39:53.160]  back but don't worry about that the roaches are scurrying in like the mold
[03:39:53.160 --> 03:39:57.160]  is coming in no no don't worry about that go look how nice the place is
[03:39:57.160 --> 03:40:03.160]  everything's fine there's a scratch in the bathroom so in the world in the
[03:40:03.160 --> 03:40:07.160]  planet on the planet that we live on there is actual atrocity where you are
[03:40:07.160 --> 03:40:12.160]  ranked your social status is you're born into a family and your the color of
[03:40:12.160 --> 03:40:16.160]  your skin and your last name and your generation generation history is your
[03:40:16.160 --> 03:40:21.160]  social class okay it's not like in the United States where the social justice
[03:40:21.160 --> 03:40:24.160]  warriors get mad if you post something on Twitter that offends someone because
[03:40:24.160 --> 03:40:29.160]  you didn't use a gender neutral term that's that's it's instead it's real
[03:40:29.160 --> 03:40:35.160]  life okay so these things actually happen and we over here are are so closed
[03:40:35.160 --> 03:40:40.160]  off all this and which is so set in the system it's like oh we must blame
[03:40:40.160 --> 03:40:43.160]  everyone else for our problems and every little minute thing is the issue
[03:40:43.160 --> 03:40:47.160]  actually things like this happen it goes on
[03:40:47.160 --> 03:40:51.160]  Emiratis are one of the most racist people in the world and this is not some
[03:40:51.160 --> 03:40:54.160]  grand gesture by them this is purely for recognition those numbers are inflated
[03:40:54.160 --> 03:40:58.160]  beyond belief what they took in were very wealthy Syrians and Syrians living in
[03:40:58.160 --> 03:41:02.160]  other Gulf Coast countries that were never part of the crisis now I'm not going
[03:41:02.160 --> 03:41:07.160]  to sit here and say everyone in in the UAE is racist clearly okay that's a
[03:41:07.160 --> 03:41:11.160]  statement by this writer another one goes on not only but vulnerable people in
[03:41:11.160 --> 03:41:14.160]  the UAE can be an extreme danger and nobody will care for their plight and
[03:41:14.160 --> 03:41:18.160]  the abusers will get away with it says for Emirati men cat kidnapped an
[03:41:18.160 --> 03:41:23.160]  Ethiopian maid gang raped her twice in different locations and ran her over
[03:41:23.160 --> 03:41:26.160]  with a car and then proceeded to stone her to death with large rocks which
[03:41:26.160 --> 03:41:33.160]  smashed this is this is disturbing okay after paying 200,000 dirhams which is
[03:41:33.160 --> 03:41:38.160]  $50,000 US blood money in total they were released from prison one of the
[03:41:38.160 --> 03:41:42.160]  attackers 13 years prior had raped and murdered a Pakistani little girl but her
[03:41:42.160 --> 03:41:46.160]  father who was an imam forgave him and they linked all the stories about that
[03:41:46.160 --> 03:41:52.160]  okay so in a happy little fake world where we have to everything is great
[03:41:52.160 --> 03:41:56.160]  they're taking Syrian refugees so good that's great we can celebrate that but
[03:41:56.160 --> 03:42:02.160]  in real life remember there are much worse things actually going on now
[03:42:02.160 --> 03:42:05.160]  what I want to do speaking of the truth about circumstances is go ahead and
[03:42:05.160 --> 03:42:10.160]  play Paul Watson's video the truth about Charlotte and remember it's not bad to
[03:42:10.160 --> 03:42:14.160]  talk about the details of things and the importance of things doesn't mean
[03:42:14.160 --> 03:42:17.160]  you're racist against everybody okay it means that you actually want to
[03:42:17.160 --> 03:42:22.160]  identify things and talk about them let's go this video
[03:42:22.160 --> 03:42:26.160]  harmonious black lives matter activists staged a peaceful protest in
[03:42:26.160 --> 03:42:31.160]  Charlotte last night but were brutally tear gas by racist cops oh wait a second
[03:42:31.160 --> 03:42:36.160]  physically attacking reporters is not a legitimate form of protest shooting each
[03:42:36.160 --> 03:42:41.160]  other is not a legitimate form of protest stealing and looting cash registers
[03:42:41.160 --> 03:42:46.160]  from local businesses is not a legitimate form of protest trying to set
[03:42:46.160 --> 03:42:51.160]  journalists on fire is not a legitimate form of protest throwing rocks off
[03:42:51.160 --> 03:42:55.160]  bridges at passing vehicles full of families is not a legitimate form of
[03:42:55.160 --> 03:43:01.160]  protest beating up innocent people in underground parking lots because they're
[03:43:01.160 --> 03:43:06.160]  white is not a legitimate form of protest smashing up apartment windows where
[03:43:06.160 --> 03:43:11.160]  black people live to protest in favor of black lives matter is not a legitimate
[03:43:11.160 --> 03:43:16.160]  form of protest smashing up buses that poor black people rely on to get to
[03:43:16.160 --> 03:43:20.160]  their jobs is not a legitimate form of protest looting the Charlotte Hornets
[03:43:20.160 --> 03:43:25.160]  team store so you can steal basketball merchandise is not a legitimate form of
[03:43:25.160 --> 03:43:30.160]  protest stealing sneakers is not a legitimate form of protest attempting to
[03:43:30.160 --> 03:43:35.160]  hijack cars and terrify their innocent occupants is not a legitimate form of
[03:43:35.160 --> 03:43:41.160]  protest but how did MSNBC report on all this by calling the rioters peaceful the
[03:43:41.160 --> 03:43:46.160]  people that are out here protesting they're hugging and they're like they're
[03:43:46.160 --> 03:43:50.160]  being very peaceful we were following this crowd that was largely peaceful
[03:43:50.160 --> 03:43:55.160]  mostly peaceful we've also seen some sweet scenes of protesters hugging one
[03:43:55.160 --> 03:43:59.160]  another and praying mostly a group of peaceful protesters peaceful peaceful
[03:43:59.160 --> 03:44:05.160]  peaceful peaceful peaceful and that's why 94% of Americans don't trust the
[03:44:05.160 --> 03:44:10.160]  mainstream media what's unfolding in Charlotte is objectively manifestly
[03:44:10.160 --> 03:44:17.160]  provably not a protest it's a violent unjustified riot by criminals gang
[03:44:17.160 --> 03:44:23.160]  members and thugs why is the media giving it legitimacy by still referring to
[03:44:23.160 --> 03:44:29.160]  it as a protest if mobs of white supremacists were looting stores setting
[03:44:29.160 --> 03:44:34.160]  fires attacking journalists and shooting guns would the media call it a
[03:44:34.160 --> 03:44:39.160]  protest but maybe I'm wrong maybe all this was completely justified because
[03:44:39.160 --> 03:44:44.160]  another racist white police officer killed an innocent unarmed black man who
[03:44:44.160 --> 03:44:49.160]  was merely carrying a book oh wait he was actually killed by a black cop
[03:44:49.160 --> 03:44:54.160]  all white people are devils but what kind of book was he carrying paperback
[03:44:54.160 --> 03:44:59.160]  hardcover oh no it was a nine millimeter gun well imagine my shock so a black
[03:44:59.160 --> 03:45:04.160]  cop shoots an armed black thug with a criminal record and then a black
[03:45:04.160 --> 03:45:10.160]  protester shoots another black protester yeah must be white people's fault I
[03:45:10.160 --> 03:45:14.160]  guess it's my fault for not checking my privilege and how did de facto black
[03:45:14.160 --> 03:45:19.160]  lives matter leader D Ray McKesson respond to the riots the looting the
[03:45:19.160 --> 03:45:24.160]  bloodshed the mayhem the violence by tweeting we stand with you because
[03:45:24.160 --> 03:45:30.160]  nothing says justice like destroying your own city and living up to the very
[03:45:30.160 --> 03:45:35.160]  stereotype about black people that you constantly complain about Barack Obama
[03:45:35.160 --> 03:45:40.160]  also stands with this group while billionaire white elitist George
[03:45:40.160 --> 03:45:44.160]  Soros bank rolls it to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars Hillary
[03:45:44.160 --> 03:45:50.160]  Clinton has promised to change laws for them they advocate killing cops
[03:45:50.160 --> 03:45:58.160]  they've inspired mass murderers who have killed black cops their ideological
[03:45:58.160 --> 03:46:04.160]  guru is a convicted cop killer on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list
[03:46:04.160 --> 03:46:08.160]  they've built an entire movement based around the completely fraudulent
[03:46:08.160 --> 03:46:13.160]  narrative that there's a racist war against black people being waged by
[03:46:13.160 --> 03:46:19.160]  cops it's manifestly provably not true this is what they're protesting against
[03:46:19.160 --> 03:46:25.160]  while none of them give a damn about this thanks to black lives matter more
[03:46:25.160 --> 03:46:30.160]  black people are killing each other because cops refuse to patrol these
[03:46:30.160 --> 03:46:36.160]  areas black lives matter is poison it's doing incredible harm to race relations
[03:46:36.160 --> 03:46:42.160]  in America it's giving gang member thugs an excuse to carry out criminal rampages
[03:46:42.160 --> 03:46:48.160]  and it's resulting in more black people being killed by other black people how
[03:46:48.160 --> 03:46:55.160]  many more cities need to burn before this reality is realized peaceful peaceful
[03:46:55.160 --> 03:47:01.160]  peaceful peaceful peaceful peaceful peaceful peaceful peaceful protesters
[03:47:01.160 --> 03:47:07.160]  division division division the further we're divided what happens is everyone
[03:47:07.160 --> 03:47:11.160]  has raw rage they're just they're primarily upset about everything that's
[03:47:11.160 --> 03:47:16.160]  happening in the world in the country and in life okay they're primarily upset
[03:47:16.160 --> 03:47:21.160]  and the thing is that the system of control call it whatever you will maybe
[03:47:21.160 --> 03:47:25.160]  it's the media maybe it is the corporate interest maybe it's whatever maybe
[03:47:25.160 --> 03:47:30.160]  it's just a organic thing that comes together like a massive biome okay that
[03:47:30.160 --> 03:47:36.160]  just wants to vie for control it knows that you can target that raw hatred and
[03:47:36.160 --> 03:47:41.160]  instead of targeting the raw hatred at the cause kind of like treating a disease
[03:47:41.160 --> 03:47:46.160]  you can target that raw hatred at something else escape goat you can go
[03:47:46.160 --> 03:47:50.160]  ahead and instead of telling people like I said the house instead of looking at
[03:47:50.160 --> 03:47:54.160]  the crumbling wall you can say well look over there look at something else and
[03:47:54.160 --> 03:47:58.160]  that is what happens when you say see the police are the enemy or see the
[03:47:58.160 --> 03:48:03.160]  protesters the enemy everyone is the enemy but the root cause every single one
[03:48:03.160 --> 03:48:10.160]  is the enemy but the root cause so that is how you completely stifle production
[03:48:10.160 --> 03:48:14.160]  you can completely stifle progress you completely stifle any form of
[03:48:14.160 --> 03:48:18.160]  intellectual renaissance happening because people are too busy loading up
[03:48:18.160 --> 03:48:23.160]  their heads with preconceived notions and funneling that raw hatred and energy
[03:48:23.160 --> 03:48:28.160]  towards the side that they've been told is bad and then we wonder why people are
[03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:33.160]  living in a suspended adulthood like this research finds young Britons living
[03:48:33.160 --> 03:48:37.160]  in suspended adulthood research finds from the Guardian significant number of
[03:48:37.160 --> 03:48:41.160]  under 30s lack self-confidence and are at risk of mental health problems with
[03:48:41.160 --> 03:48:46.160]  women worst affected says report despair worries about the future and financial
[03:48:46.160 --> 03:48:50.160]  pressures are taking a toll on millions of young Britons according to a poll
[03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:53.160]  which found young women in particular were suffering low pay and lack of work in
[03:48:53.160 --> 03:48:57.160]  today's Britain are resulting in suspended adulthood with many living or moving
[03:48:57.160 --> 03:49:00.160]  back in with their parents and putting off having children according to the poll
[03:49:00.160 --> 03:49:06.160]  large numbers describe themselves as worn down 42% lacking self-confidence 47%
[03:49:06.160 --> 03:49:10.160]  and feeling worried about the future 51% yeah 70% of the United States is
[03:49:10.160 --> 03:49:14.160]  worried about the future and doesn't like the direction the country is heading either
[03:49:14.160 --> 03:49:17.160]  says the young women's trust the charity that commissioned the polling by
[03:49:17.160 --> 03:49:21.160]  populist data solutions one that Britain was facing a quote generation of young
[03:49:21.160 --> 03:49:25.160]  people in crisis as it called on the government to take steps including
[03:49:25.160 --> 03:49:29.160]  creating a minister with responsibility for overall youth policy here's the thing
[03:49:29.160 --> 03:49:35.160]  all these problems from people wanting to ride on the street to the youth
[03:49:35.160 --> 03:49:40.160]  feeling like they are crap and having no self-worth and having no jobs and
[03:49:40.160 --> 03:49:45.160]  everything isn't just going to be fixed by promoting a minister of the
[03:49:45.160 --> 03:49:50.160]  government for youth services or whatever okay this is it's not like they just
[03:49:50.160 --> 03:49:54.160]  need to sit down and talk to somebody it's a core problem all of this is stemming
[03:49:54.160 --> 03:49:59.160]  from it all of this is stemming from it yet we fail over and over again to
[03:49:59.160 --> 03:50:04.160]  address the issues we fail so many so many times instead we could be doing
[03:50:04.160 --> 03:50:10.160]  things like going to Mars we could be doing things like expanding the planet
[03:50:10.160 --> 03:50:14.160]  we could be doing so much other great things Senate panel authorizes money
[03:50:14.160 --> 03:50:19.160]  from Mars mission shuttle replacement for example so Hillary Clinton does not
[03:50:19.160 --> 03:50:23.160]  want to according to information I read continue to fund NASA believe it or not
[03:50:23.160 --> 03:50:27.160]  Trump is the candidate that wants to fund NASA so they know this and the Senate
[03:50:27.160 --> 03:50:30.160]  is already authorizing an additional mission with a new president on the
[03:50:30.160 --> 03:50:33.160]  horizon a key Senate committee moved Wednesday to protect the long-standing
[03:50:33.160 --> 03:50:36.160]  priorities of the nation's space program from the potential upheaval of an
[03:50:36.160 --> 03:50:40.160]  incoming administration members of the Commerce Science and Transportation
[03:50:40.160 --> 03:50:44.160]  Committee passed a bipartisan bill authorizing 19.5 billion get to continue
[03:50:44.160 --> 03:50:48.160]  work on a Mars mission in efforts to send astronauts on private rockets to the
[03:50:48.160 --> 03:50:53.160]  ISS from U.S. soil regardless of shifting political winds see these are things
[03:50:53.160 --> 03:50:57.160]  we should be focusing on not whether or not someone is going to be triggered by
[03:50:57.160 --> 03:51:01.160]  a word we didn't even intend to be racist we are back as we're coming as the

[03:51:13.160 --> 03:51:18.160]  sulfur enzyme in the liver get rid of the metals extendivite just may improve
[03:51:18.160 --> 03:51:22.160]  your overall health products like extendivite are the only way we're going

[03:55:15.160 --> 03:55:18.160]  support something you believe in and let's talk about this
[03:55:18.160 --> 03:55:22.160]  so first of all Mark Zuckerberg according to this piece
[03:55:22.160 --> 03:55:26.160]  Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg aimed to quote cure prevent and manage all disease
[03:55:26.160 --> 03:55:30.160]  couple plans to invest three billion over next decade to help scientists develop
[03:55:30.160 --> 03:55:34.160]  and utilize tools such as artificial intelligence and blood monitors to treat illnesses
[03:55:34.160 --> 03:55:40.160]  they say can we cure prevent or manage all disease by the end of the century
[03:55:40.160 --> 03:55:44.160]  he asks speaking in front of a packed lecture theater at the University of California
[03:55:44.160 --> 03:55:48.160]  the Chan Zuckerberg initiative will focus on some of the world's biggest killers
[03:55:48.160 --> 03:55:51.160]  including heart disease cancer infectious disease and neurological diseases
[03:55:51.160 --> 03:55:56.160]  one of his biggest investments is to be a 600 million biohub at UFCF
[03:55:56.160 --> 03:55:58.160]  which will bring together scientists and engineers
[03:55:58.160 --> 03:56:02.160]  second focus will be transformative technology all of which will be made available to all scientists everywhere
[03:56:02.160 --> 03:56:05.160]  now let's talk about that
[03:56:05.160 --> 03:56:10.160]  so sounds very interesting sounds reminiscent of a
[03:56:10.160 --> 03:56:14.160]  Elysium thing that you can get in it just it cures everything right
[03:56:14.160 --> 03:56:19.160]  why are we still focusing not to put down billions of dollars in this
[03:56:19.160 --> 03:56:23.160]  interesting concept why are we still focusing as a holdout on treating
[03:56:23.160 --> 03:56:27.160]  as opposed to actually looking at why it's happening in the first place
[03:56:27.160 --> 03:56:31.160]  sure we know some of the factors but things like this it's like we're going to spend all this money
[03:56:31.160 --> 03:56:34.160]  it's like when you check out at the store and they say would you like to give
[03:56:34.160 --> 03:56:38.160]  five dollars to cancer research
[03:56:38.160 --> 03:56:41.160]  well you know how about how about we talk about this kind of stuff first
[03:56:41.160 --> 03:56:45.160]  new report finds quote Aaron Brockovich chemical and US drinking water
[03:56:45.160 --> 03:56:50.160]  dangerous levels of chromium-6 are contaminating tap water consumed by hundreds of millions of Americans
[03:56:50.160 --> 03:56:52.160]  according to national report released Tuesday
[03:56:52.160 --> 03:56:57.160]  the agency has never set a specific limit for chromium-6 in drinking water
[03:56:57.160 --> 03:57:01.160]  there's scientific uncertainty regarding safe levels of this chemical and drinking water
[03:57:01.160 --> 03:57:04.160]  and possible long-term consequences of ingestion
[03:57:04.160 --> 03:57:07.160]  David Knight gave this to me before I got on the show by the way it's really interesting
[03:57:07.160 --> 03:57:11.160]  but this new analysis comes from the environmental working group an independent advocacy group
[03:57:11.160 --> 03:57:14.160]  examines evidence from water systems throughout the nation
[03:57:14.160 --> 03:57:20.160]  concludes the tap of 218 million Americans contains levels of chromium-6
[03:57:20.160 --> 03:57:24.160]  now here's the key thing okay the EWG rep says
[03:57:24.160 --> 03:57:28.160]  Americans are exposed to dozens if not hundreds of other cancer-causing chemicals
[03:57:28.160 --> 03:57:32.160]  every day in their drinking water their consumer products and their foods
[03:57:32.160 --> 03:57:36.160]  and what the best science of the last decade tells us is that these chemicals
[03:57:36.160 --> 03:57:40.160]  acting in combination with each other can be more dangerous than exposure to a single chemical
[03:57:40.160 --> 03:57:46.160]  exactly they all interact differently in the body and together before entering the body
[03:57:46.160 --> 03:57:50.160]  so when we drink tap water full of junk and contaminants
[03:57:50.160 --> 03:57:53.160]  gee what is happening where we eat food that is laced with contaminants
[03:57:53.160 --> 03:57:57.160]  we're forgetting the root intake source
[03:57:57.160 --> 03:58:01.160]  we're forgetting that it's like if you had a boat filled with water
[03:58:01.160 --> 03:58:05.160]  you wouldn't just get as many buckets as possible and dump it out you'd say why is it filling with water
[03:58:05.160 --> 03:58:08.160]  let's fill up the hole in which the water is coming from
[03:58:08.160 --> 03:58:13.160]  instead of let's would you like to donate money to purchase more buckets
[03:58:13.160 --> 03:58:15.160]  to remove the water from the boat
[03:58:15.160 --> 03:58:19.160]  charitable donation today and like fill up the hole it's filling with water because there's a hole in it
[03:58:19.160 --> 03:58:24.160]  would you like to donate to purchase more buckets for charity to remove water from the boat
[03:58:24.160 --> 03:58:28.160]  right it's a silly concept we need to actually look at what's happening in the first place
[03:58:28.160 --> 03:58:30.160]  just like everything else in the world right
[03:58:30.160 --> 03:58:34.160]  it has been the alex jones show fourth hour thank you for joining infowarslife.com
