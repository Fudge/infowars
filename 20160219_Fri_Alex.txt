[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:31.640]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.640 --> 00:36.360]  former head of his campaign and his confidant Roger Stone is going to be joining us from
[00:36.360 --> 00:43.160]  South Carolina coming up in two minus thirty-three minutes from now and the article that we wrote
[00:43.160 --> 00:50.040]  about his latest comments is at drudgereport.com right now via infowars.com confidant Trump
[00:50.040 --> 00:55.920]  is always wearing a bullet-proof vest now he said that on this show you know five six
[00:55.920 --> 01:01.160]  months ago and he talked about how Trump carries a firearm pretty much all the time
[01:01.160 --> 01:04.760]  and the press made a big deal with that my gosh a presidential frontrunner with all these
[01:04.760 --> 01:08.720]  death threats and El Chapo saying he wants him dead and ISIS saying they want him dead
[01:08.720 --> 01:14.520]  and he he he has a bullet-proof vest that's almost as crazy as a cop wearing a bullet-proof
[01:14.520 --> 01:19.880]  vest or an army soldier wearing a helmet I mean can you imagine how extreme and horrible
[01:19.880 --> 01:25.120]  he is that's what the New York Daily News has labeled him the Antichrist the Washington
[01:25.120 --> 01:31.960]  Post labeled yours truly the universal vector of conspiracy theories yesterday I'm very
[01:31.960 --> 01:37.960]  honored to have that title you mean the universal vector of questioning we have a giant broadcast
[01:37.960 --> 01:41.120]  line of today so jam-packed with gas I'll tell you all about it when we come into the
[01:41.120 --> 01:46.560]  main launch of the transmission this is just that little kickoff portion but the big exclusive
[01:46.560 --> 01:51.920]  article for Breitbart Pat Buchanan says Donald Trump's rise is rejection of a quarter century
[01:51.920 --> 01:57.280]  of bush republicanism and that's what we're seeing is the Rockefeller blue blood democratic
[01:57.280 --> 02:04.920]  party coup over the Democrats in deep deep water right now deep boiling water and so
[02:04.920 --> 02:11.000]  it is bye-bye to that political dynasty of open borders taking our guns signing on to
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.640]  UN treaties and more the Pope has come out as a big fat hypocrite said open up your borders
[02:17.640 --> 02:21.360]  let anybody come in that wants to but he doesn't say that Italy should have to do that and
[02:21.360 --> 02:25.720]  he's got 200 foot walls around the Vatican the biggest in the world the thickest in the
[02:25.720 --> 02:30.700]  world I've been saying this for six months about the pope since I was in Italy pointing
[02:30.700 --> 02:34.880]  it out he'd already been to the US calling from borders and to Mexico he's coming here
[02:34.880 --> 02:39.600]  all the time he's so political like no other pope we've ever seen an extremely globalist
[02:39.600 --> 02:46.320]  and finally Donald Trump picked up on sort of tweeting photos of the giant walls yesterday
[02:46.320 --> 02:51.640]  so I thought we'd play a clip of myself yesterday talking about this and then of course Trump
[02:51.640 --> 02:57.560]  echoing that here it is the Vatican has 200 plus foot walls we put a photo up of that
[02:57.560 --> 03:02.640]  for TV viewers or just Google Vatican walls biggest thickest in the world you go in there
[03:02.640 --> 03:06.800]  they shoot you he hasn't taken one refugee in there we are being flooded we are being
[03:06.800 --> 03:11.840]  shot up we are being attacked we are a joke the whole world but to pay for everybody's
[03:11.840 --> 03:17.120]  health care we're going bankrupt they're taking old ladies houses for back IRS taxes they
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.520]  can't pay whether they be black white Hispanic who cries for them and you sit there and you
[03:22.520 --> 03:28.280]  say we're racist because you have the most open immigration system in the world what
[03:28.280 --> 03:36.040]  a creepy old evil looking man creeping around socialist dirt bag him and Bernie Sanders
[03:36.040 --> 03:41.120]  you know how to marry each other I mean I am just sick of it so Trump responded just
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.200]  moments ago you know honestly the Vatican has massive walls around we should build so walls
[03:46.200 --> 03:50.080]  like the Vatican so perhaps he wants to move out of the Vatican but if you look at the
[03:50.080 --> 03:56.040]  walls around the Vatican I've been there and those are walls yeah in fact he's tweeting
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.640]  a whole bunch of pictures of those walls right now Mr. Trump also saying quote it's disgraceful
[04:00.640 --> 04:05.840]  for the pope to question his faith and warning the pontiff that quote if and when the Vatican
[04:05.840 --> 04:12.320]  is attacked by ISIS everyone knows that ISIS's ultimate trophy is probably the Vatican I can
[04:12.320 --> 04:18.000]  promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump were the president
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.560]  so there you go and look I got mad at the pope yesterday called him a dirtbag and I should be
[04:23.560 --> 04:27.480]  respectful not of him but of people that are Catholics who are great people some of the best
[04:27.480 --> 04:32.840]  folks I've met but he's not a Catholic he's not a Christian in my view and he's fair game for
[04:32.840 --> 04:38.040]  seeing Donald Trump isn't a Christian in his religious role that's a big deal and it's very
[04:38.040 --> 04:43.040]  insulting it's very hypocritical and he's gotten right in the political arena of our internal
[04:43.040 --> 04:48.760]  politics and he's fair game I'll just say this I won't call him a dirtbag I'll call him an
[04:48.760 --> 04:55.600]  America destroyer he wants to kill this country he wants world government the pope is an enemy of
[04:55.600 --> 05:04.600]  humanity North Korea is planning a terrorist attack on South Korea this according to the
[05:04.600 --> 05:11.040]  national intelligence service that says North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un gave the order to begin
[05:11.040 --> 05:17.400]  preparations the NIST warning covered a large number of possible targets including subways
[05:17.400 --> 05:24.080]  shopping malls and even a nuclear power plant all key lines of communication between North and
[05:24.080 --> 05:29.800]  South Korea have been cut off I've long predicted my world affairs briefs that new North Korean
[05:29.800 --> 05:35.400]  attack on South Korea will be a trigger event for World War 3 and you probably have a nuclear EMP
[05:35.400 --> 05:40.040]  and nuclear strike on America within a week after that starting now as political scientists and
[05:40.040 --> 05:45.520]  authors strategic relocation Joel Scousen who says that a fight between North and South Korea

[09:04.840 --> 09:11.480]  former campaign head roger stone joining us his story is the top of drudgerport.com right now
[09:12.600 --> 09:18.120]  confidant trump is always wearing a bullet proof vest and the media makes a big deal out of that
[09:19.960 --> 09:26.360]  kind of like when it stone talked about how trump carries a firearm and trump was asked about it
[09:26.360 --> 09:29.880]  said yeah i do sometimes not going to tell you when well it's all the time
[09:29.880 --> 09:37.720]  and they made a controversy and saying it's incredible he carries a gun see how radical he is
[09:38.760 --> 09:43.000]  as if a public figure worth millions of dollars having a right to defend themselves
[09:43.560 --> 09:50.360]  is alien or strange ronald reagan carried a gun but that's how disconnected they hope you are
[09:50.920 --> 09:55.400]  police officer carries a gun where's the bullet proof vest i'd say they're in a lot less danger
[09:55.400 --> 09:59.800]  and they're in danger they're in a lot less danger than the republican frontrunner with all these
[09:59.800 --> 10:04.680]  haters at all these giant town halls and open events without screening basically or limited
[10:04.680 --> 10:09.880]  screening he's probably one of the most in danger people in america or in the world
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.120]  and they act like it's weird that he wears a bullet proof vest they say why doesn't he button
[10:16.120 --> 10:26.440]  his code well what's he fat no you can see the bullet proof vest and i'm going to just leave it
[10:26.440 --> 10:31.480]  at that he's got other security measures that i've been told about
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.760]  and it just shows how they have this idea that hollywood can have bodyguards
[10:39.640 --> 10:45.240]  presidents can have bodyguards supreme court justices can have them but citizens even when
[10:45.240 --> 10:52.040]  they're a frontrunner it's bad that is the disconnect also coming up i haven't gotten
[10:52.040 --> 10:56.360]  into the whole black lives matter movement in the last few months because quite frankly i'm
[10:56.360 --> 11:00.360]  really sick of watching these people and really sick of seeing what they're peddling and these
[11:00.360 --> 11:04.200]  rappers meeting at the white house and obama meeting at the white house with the leaders of
[11:04.200 --> 11:10.920]  black lives matter i'm against police brutality i'm against in some cases profiling an obvious
[11:10.920 --> 11:16.680]  persecution of black people being singled out but if you look at the statistics and the numbers in
[11:16.680 --> 11:22.840]  the aggregate and the numbers of deaths it is one of the least dangerous trends for black people
[11:22.840 --> 11:30.680]  in this country maximum a couple hundred black people a year shot by police and in most cases
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.000]  it's justified but let's just say none of it's justified is that the number one issue facing
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.080]  black america double unemployment planned parenthood targeting you killing 52 percent of your people is
[11:41.080 --> 11:46.520]  something killing millions of people a year big or is a couple hundred big i mean see i just use
[11:46.520 --> 11:52.840]  logic folks and then i ask who is behind the black lives matter movement the white house
[11:52.840 --> 12:00.040]  soros he found differences between catholic and uh orthodox in ukraine got them all to kill each
[12:00.040 --> 12:05.480]  other overthrew an elected government now the country is in decline they go in and find suny
[12:05.480 --> 12:11.000]  versus sheite they exacerbate the differences there overthrow the countries and then basically come
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.080]  in and take them over and they come here and they bring in giant hispanic populations fill them full
[12:17.080 --> 12:23.000]  of socialist hatred full of racial vitriol in many cases at the universities and then turn them into
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.040]  chip on the shoulder political bodies though they haven't been as effective as doing that with black
[12:28.040 --> 12:31.240]  folks the black folks really did have something they could you know say it was terrible and horrible
[12:31.240 --> 12:38.520]  in long term that happened to them that was systemic but it's such mind control and i'll talk
[12:38.520 --> 12:46.280]  about this some today to watch this where kanye west and jz and 50 cent all these people are just
[12:46.280 --> 12:52.600]  constantly going and stirring stuff up constantly going around like that's their street cred to
[12:52.600 --> 12:59.000]  sell tickets and then complaining i only made 50 million last year kanye said i need more money
[13:00.360 --> 13:07.640]  actually said that it's a joke you've got these filthy rich people running around complaining
[13:07.640 --> 13:12.440]  about all this stuff and it's government directed to get us all of each other's throat and clue they're
[13:12.440 --> 13:16.440]  heating it back up ahead of the election just like when the radical muslims didn't get elected in
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.480]  kenya he told his cousin odinga go ahead and have riots and he is you know senate senate letter
[13:21.480 --> 13:25.480]  they'll make you a government position and they did so they're looking to disrupt this election
[13:25.480 --> 13:30.120]  they're looking for some big distractions to bring in civil emergency's reek and appoint a supreme
[13:30.120 --> 13:38.120]  court justice there's a lot of stuff going on a lot of hanky panky right now so miami police union
[13:38.120 --> 13:45.000]  votes to boycott the onsay concert police union in other cities considering similar action but
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.040]  the bigger issue is why at the super bowl would you see all this being pushed like the gun control
[13:52.040 --> 13:57.560]  like the anti-family stuff like the anti-father garbage and you know doritos has a pro fetus ad
[13:57.560 --> 14:04.200]  and the planned parenthood complaints and the feminist complaint there's it's all an agenda
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.680]  the agenda isn't coming from Beyonce and kanye they're just the front people that do what they're
[14:08.680 --> 14:15.320]  told by hollywood it's the establishment doing this and the police need to start pointing to that if
[14:15.320 --> 14:22.440]  you really want to change the country sure nice start you know don't supply security to these folks
[14:23.880 --> 14:28.840]  if they want to sit there and you know say that you deserve to basically be killed because that's
[14:28.840 --> 14:33.800]  what they do now we're going to go to break here in a few minutes but i want to start going to this

[16:01.640 --> 16:07.720]  sacrifice of millions of unknown soldiers george washington himself battling severe
[16:07.720 --> 16:13.880]  dysentery crawled on his hands and knees in the dark to defend this great experiment known as
[16:13.880 --> 16:19.880]  the united states of america now there is an open media battle waging between the new world
[16:19.880 --> 16:26.760]  orders pope frances and the awakening realization of complete tyranny with a bullseye sighted on
[16:26.760 --> 16:33.160]  millions of americans caught in the crosshairs presidential candidate donald j trump and trump
[16:33.160 --> 16:39.320]  isn't backing down steve watson writes g.o.p frontrunner donald trump has promised to make
[16:39.320 --> 16:46.760]  public currently guarded secrets surrounding the 9-11 attacks should he be elected president
[16:46.760 --> 16:51.880]  speaking at a campaign event bluffed in south carolina trump continued his onslaught on the
[16:51.880 --> 16:58.360]  bush presidency by once again raising the issue of the attack on the world trade center on 9 11
[16:58.360 --> 17:05.720]  2001 we went after iraq we decimated the country iran's taken over okay but it wasn't the iraqis
[17:06.440 --> 17:10.200]  you will find out who really knocked down the world trade center because they have papers
[17:10.200 --> 17:15.640]  in there that are very secret you may find it's the sorties okay but you will find out but it
[17:15.640 --> 17:21.320]  wasn't right trump was referring to the 28 pages of the original joint congressional inquiry into
[17:21.320 --> 17:28.360]  9 11 which remain classified and withheld from the public on grounds of national security the
[17:28.360 --> 17:34.920]  pages are already known to implicate the saudi royal family in financing the supposed hijackers
[17:34.920 --> 17:40.600]  in the united states prior to the attacks speaking at a press conference regarding the missing pages
[17:40.600 --> 17:46.520]  in 2014 kentucky representative thomas massie lobbied for the release of the document stating
[17:46.520 --> 17:51.640]  he read them and that they challenged him to reconsider everything he knew about the event
[17:51.640 --> 17:58.760]  i had to stop every couple pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange my understanding
[17:58.760 --> 18:05.720]  of history for the past 13 years and the years leading up to that it challenges you to rethink
[18:05.720 --> 18:12.440]  everything and so i think the whole country needs to go through that it's going to be difficult and
[18:12.440 --> 18:18.200]  could be embarrassing but that is no reason to keep the truth for the american people donald trump
[18:18.200 --> 18:23.800]  has repeatedly attacked jeb bush on the campaign trail and at debates by raising the issue of 9
[18:23.800 --> 18:30.360]  11 and the intelligence warnings that were provided to the bush administration and subsequently
[18:30.360 --> 18:36.600]  ignored jeb bush has avoided the issue and even mocked those who raise it would you be in favor
[18:36.600 --> 18:40.520]  of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9 11 commission report would you be

[18:54.600 --> 19:01.000]  about those who facilitated it must end now trump's comments have prompted establishment
[19:01.000 --> 19:07.080]  republicans and conservative talking heads to label him a 9 11 truther and a radical kook
[19:07.080 --> 19:13.720]  his enemies are coming out of the woodwork fresh on the heels of a big catholic no no by legitimizing
[19:13.720 --> 19:20.120]  contraception as a lesser evil in the face of the world health organizations the various zika virus
[19:20.120 --> 19:26.040]  roll out pope francis is weighing into the us presidential election saying donald trump is
[19:26.040 --> 19:33.000]  not christian abc news reports when asked by a reporter can a good catholic vote for this man
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.760]  francis responded by saying a person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be
[19:38.760 --> 19:44.360]  and not building bridges is not christian the pope is the spokesman for the decimation of the
[19:44.360 --> 19:51.240]  world's cultures by what in europe is clearly either a horrendous mistake or a deliberate action
[19:51.240 --> 19:56.680]  pope francis broke new ground when he unleashed his temper on adoring catholics after stumbling
[19:56.680 --> 20:01.480]  from giving a hug to a disabled person in a wheelchair the pope is losing his temper on
[20:01.480 --> 20:08.040]  his followers for a reason because pope francis knows a new world order is right around the
[20:08.040 --> 20:18.040]  corner and he doesn't need his followers anymore john barron for info wars dot com a powerful transmission
[20:18.040 --> 20:26.120]  we're gonna have that posted to info wars dot com right now and we need everybody to get the video
[20:26.120 --> 20:32.600]  out of their friends and family and neighbors uh this is a war and the reason i get even more
[20:32.600 --> 20:38.680]  animated and more aggressive and more focused is that people need to be broken out of their trance
[20:38.680 --> 20:46.040]  and realize that this isn't a game this is for all the marbles and the social engineers that run
[20:46.040 --> 20:53.400]  the planetary government don't want to just run us don't want to just conquer us because they think
[20:53.400 --> 21:00.600]  they can manage things better they are fundamentally anti-human and want to break the human cycle forever
[21:00.600 --> 21:10.520]  because it overthrows monopolies with innovation they are fundamentally in competition with free
[21:10.520 --> 21:20.280]  will and the human spirit period those that survive under the technotronic era will live in a
[21:23.080 --> 21:29.560]  form of undeadness you'll still have blood coursing through your veins but you will not
[21:29.560 --> 21:37.960]  be human and from birth you will be shuttered in to a false reality and programmed where there is
[21:37.960 --> 21:44.600]  no language authorized but the daily download and where you become nothing more but a biological
[21:44.600 --> 21:57.480]  robot an android a replicant a nexus six and i've got stacks of news articles here today
[21:57.480 --> 22:02.520]  several of them are big liberal tech people and others saying i'm sick of seeing homeless clean
[22:02.520 --> 22:09.560]  them out the street they're disgusting wait till there's a hundred million homeless people and
[22:09.560 --> 22:16.760]  not five million they're going to eat you alive you fools thought you could rob everybody and
[22:16.760 --> 22:23.480]  build an anti-capitalist system and then scapegoat capitalism and you think socialism will just
[22:23.480 --> 22:28.760]  pacify people when the means of production is destroyed halan is coming out saying sorry you
[22:28.760 --> 22:33.880]  can't work 35 hours anymore a week sorry we got to cut your vacation sorry we're taking your pension
[22:33.880 --> 22:40.040]  funds the french that got domesticated and thought socialism was so great and are now so spoiled
[22:42.360 --> 22:47.480]  you are about to be completely gutted and that's what happens once socialism goes into its final
[22:47.480 --> 22:53.160]  phases then it collapses and either fascism or communism comes in which are basically the same
[22:53.160 --> 23:01.080]  thing because with communism they just have a fascist group that's above the law of oligarchs
[23:01.080 --> 23:07.080]  and they call it communist but really it's just fascism using communism as a management model
[23:07.080 --> 23:10.760]  and by the way those of you that went to political science and you know and and read books and you
[23:10.760 --> 23:16.600]  go that's not true they're completely different i've read bonita musolini's writings and hitler's
[23:16.600 --> 23:22.280]  writings mind confin more i've read dos kapital i've read the complete communist manifesto probably
[23:22.280 --> 23:32.520]  ten times and the political ideas i have coined and my perspective has invaded the body politic
[23:32.520 --> 23:35.960]  rugged me interview and some news reporter from the netherlands and she's quoting me about the
[23:35.960 --> 23:41.240]  left right paradigm and dichotomy and how it's false and has no idea of who i am she's repeating
[23:41.240 --> 23:47.400]  something i coined 20 years ago that is success ladies and gentlemen when you hear people all
[23:47.400 --> 23:51.640]  over using your terms and you don't even make a comment you just go oh really interesting thank
[23:51.640 --> 24:00.360]  you for that information i don't go to some vomiterian college and have them fill me full
[24:00.360 --> 24:09.960]  of jackabin propaganda and then come back and regurgitate it like i'm smart i've read your
[24:09.960 --> 24:17.080]  founding father play dough three of his books the republic three times i first read the republic
[24:17.080 --> 24:28.680]  when i was 10 years old or tried to and if you guys want to know where you're coming from you need
[24:28.680 --> 24:35.880]  to go read it if you want to know who the dominant philosopher is of the world who wrote the book on
[24:35.880 --> 24:45.240]  the eugenicist two thousand three hundred years later if you want to know where hitler got it all
[24:45.240 --> 24:48.440]  if you want to know where day the rockefeller got it all if you want to know where's the big
[24:48.440 --> 24:52.040]  new brzezinski comes from if you want to know where george soros comes from if you want to know
[24:52.040 --> 25:03.080]  where vi lennon comes from you have to know about play dough and he didn't use terms like liberal
[25:03.080 --> 25:10.360]  and conservative he didn't use terms like communist and fascist he used terms like ruling elite and
[25:10.360 --> 25:22.760]  cattle and if you want to be cattle that's your decision i and mine are not going to be
[25:27.560 --> 25:29.640]  they think they've got it all figured out
[25:29.640 --> 25:40.760]  but with the return of man with the return of people that want to actually build a community
[25:40.760 --> 25:46.440]  and actually want to be honorable and actually like to see success and like to be challenged and
[25:46.440 --> 25:52.680]  like to be defeated by someone that's better whether because we're all about the species we're all
[25:52.680 --> 25:57.720]  about human empowerment we're all about renaissance with the return of light coming back into the
[25:57.720 --> 26:07.320]  world not the false light but the true light with that coming back into the world you are in deep
[26:07.320 --> 26:16.840]  trouble and you know it the false prophets of this system are fraud and they're not going to fall
[26:16.840 --> 26:24.040]  because they are already fell and that's why they want to drag us along with them into their
[26:24.040 --> 26:34.360]  profane rattles and we're not going to do it because those of us that are awake and are tuned in
[26:35.240 --> 26:40.440]  not to your false paradigm but into the universe into the mind of god
[26:42.680 --> 26:47.960]  understand that this is nothing but a test and nothing but an animating contest
[26:47.960 --> 26:59.560]  so you are defeated your top generals your top captains your top field marshals your top wizards
[27:01.480 --> 27:01.960]  know that
[27:05.640 --> 27:10.200]  and they believe taking a big chunk of humanity with them into the pit
[27:10.200 --> 27:18.120]  that somehow they're going to build a new reality we've seen the realities you build
[27:18.120 --> 27:26.840]  with the power you've had on this earth and you build slums and ignorance and hate and division
[27:26.840 --> 27:38.840]  and ugliness and poverty bernie sanders is a nas feratu hillary clinton is a blood drinking
[27:38.840 --> 27:41.400]  which politically metaphysically
[27:44.920 --> 27:49.960]  these republican leaders are a bunch of narcissistic social climbing quit cowards
[27:52.840 --> 27:57.080]  and they hate you and your family they think they're better than you and they think you're stupid
[27:58.760 --> 28:03.720]  because they hate themselves they project it onto you and they've had some pretty good
[28:03.720 --> 28:08.840]  success turning us into a bunch of mutants but i'll take the mutant population that's
[28:08.840 --> 28:12.840]  been under chemical and bio attack for a hundred years any day over your scum

[28:20.200 --> 28:25.960]  with mr stone trump insider with a bunch of breaking intel and more we rarely have to pull
[28:25.960 --> 28:33.720]  a special before it's it's it's due date we we tend to extend specials when supplies last of the

[28:38.760 --> 28:43.720]  this operation it's true providence i have to pull the super mail special right now it's been
[28:43.720 --> 28:48.760]  pulled an hour ago 20 off it's pulled because it'll sell out within a day at the current sales
[28:48.760 --> 28:54.200]  rates and we're not getting more it looks like for a month that is a big problem i miscalculated
[28:54.200 --> 28:59.160]  the special was too popular uh and so i'm pulling it because we've got to have enough for auto ship

[29:19.400 --> 29:24.520]  for that uh but superfemale vitality works just as good in men in my experience some people like
[29:24.520 --> 29:30.280]  it better some not as much superfemale we've got plenty of that so that's still 20 off super mail

[34:21.880 --> 34:28.200]  of a quarter century of bush republican domination rockfeller republican garbage and the man who
[34:28.200 --> 34:34.760]  worked for reagan and nixon and the bushes as well for years has been valiantly uh exposing

[34:58.680 --> 35:03.880]  this is hardcore this is hardcore and this is the guy advising donald trump you notice what he
[35:03.880 --> 35:07.720]  talks about on the show you later hear trump talking about he's formerly the head of the campaign
[35:07.720 --> 35:12.520]  he resigned off the campaign uh i don't know six months ago or so so he could go big guns and
[35:12.520 --> 35:19.480]  say whatever he wanted but i tell you you notice trump comes out with the facts of the 28 pages
[35:19.480 --> 35:25.640]  i've had congresspeople senators on that have seen it an order to stand down on 9 11 in order for
[35:25.640 --> 35:31.240]  the fbi not to stop the hijackers because they were saudi blaming iraq donald trump comes out
[35:31.240 --> 35:35.160]  he talks about it they all demonizing they stage booze his approval writing goes up
[35:36.520 --> 35:40.280]  and then he talks about the secret pages they make fun of and say it doesn't exist now the media
[35:40.280 --> 35:44.920]  is having to admit it does exist trump has gone from somebody that i admire and support
[35:44.920 --> 35:49.240]  is obviously better than hillary and sanders and these other republicans too the real deal 100
[35:50.200 --> 35:55.480]  and i think back to stone you know a decade ago at jfk of bench and writing best-selling books on
[35:55.480 --> 36:01.480]  the government killing jfk i mean we're not conspiracy theorists it's fact and so the washington
[36:01.480 --> 36:06.360]  post called me the universal vector of conspiracy theory on scalia and said that i said obama
[36:06.360 --> 36:10.920]  strangled him i didn't say that i said if they don't have an autopsy it's suspicious saturday the next
[36:10.920 --> 36:15.320]  day they announced it and they kept changing the story and then he's out there at this weird ranch
[36:15.320 --> 36:19.800]  of democrats and there's a pillow over his head and all i said is have an autopsy and all these
[36:19.800 --> 36:23.400]  detectives have come out and said that and trump came out and said it and he got attacked and now
[36:23.400 --> 36:27.960]  the pope's attacking i'm going to stop ranting because we've only got him until the end of the
[36:27.960 --> 36:31.880]  hour and he's going to be obviously on the ground this weekend out in south carolina richard reeves
[36:31.880 --> 36:35.080]  is there we're going to have interviews with him again this weekend we're going to be following this
[36:35.080 --> 36:39.640]  key battle so we're going to talk about how is trump really doing in his expert view and then
[36:39.640 --> 36:43.480]  we're going to talk about each of these issues and an article that we wrote today that's on
[36:43.480 --> 36:48.680]  drudgereport.com confidant trump is always wearing a bulletproof vest ominous answer to
[36:48.680 --> 36:53.480]  why donald never buttons up his jacket so that's the in the four minutes i just talked that's the field
[36:54.120 --> 37:00.280]  of of points i'd like him to cover uh and you can tackle any of those you want i mean the pope
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.760]  versus trump lying about him when he's got 200 foot walls trump basically quoting me i've been
[37:04.760 --> 37:09.720]  hammering that for six months these 200 foot walls uh very exciting on that front he's just
[37:09.720 --> 37:16.040]  blowing this socialist pope away this is amazing uh where do you want to start mr stone uh alex
[37:16.040 --> 37:21.240]  totally up to you you've got a lot of ground to cover there but it's an exciting time to be an american
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.120]  because i really think we're on the cusp of taking our country back because of patriots like you
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.480]  because of patriots like donald trump they can call us conspiracy theorists as you know that's a
[37:31.480 --> 37:36.440]  way to try to discredit us all we are is truth tellers we speak from the heart like donald
[37:36.440 --> 37:41.640]  trump we speak from the heart and let the chips fall where they may so he's blowing the whistle
[37:41.640 --> 37:48.440]  on the globalists uh this is a rejection of 30 years of bushism they've destroyed our economy
[37:48.440 --> 37:53.640]  they've given us a terrible trade policies they've opened our borders to criminals and now the
[37:53.640 --> 38:00.040]  chickens are coming home to roost patrick cannon's absolutely right they have sold us out people know
[38:00.040 --> 38:07.000]  their traders they're out of bullets what do you expect them to do though as hillary now if she
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.680]  says anything bad about sanders everybody boozer she's now behind uh trump is ahead of her in polls
[38:12.680 --> 38:17.480]  the republicans should just get behind him he's the nominee it's over i don't trust any of these
[38:17.480 --> 38:21.640]  other guys now if the stuff they've done i'm just going to be honest i'm not being nasty i'm trump or
[38:21.640 --> 38:28.040]  or bust that's it yeah unfortunately that's not going to happen unlike when ronald reagan ran the
[38:28.040 --> 38:33.640]  table in the early primaries and george bush finally threw in the towel by the michigan primary
[38:33.640 --> 38:39.320]  uh and the republican establishment smelling a winter and desperate to get back at the trough
[38:39.960 --> 38:45.000]  back dragan you're not going to see that here i still believe uh that there will be an attempt
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.680]  to stop trump at a brokered convention these rules have been rigged against him they were
[38:50.680 --> 38:56.680]  actually rigged against the patriot ron paul but those rules are still in place i have a long
[38:56.680 --> 39:03.240]  piece coming for breitbart explains exactly how the establishment hopes to stop down from it is
[39:03.240 --> 39:08.840]  very clear that they have abandoned the corpse of jab bush i'd like to hope that my book played
[39:08.840 --> 39:15.640]  some small part in this when george w bush was at the uh in south carolina on monday for his big
[39:15.640 --> 39:19.960]  speech or stop right there i don't mean to interrupt you your your book your advice you don't like to
[39:19.960 --> 39:24.760]  brag but you talk to trump every day obviously he's listening to you he's checking the facts
[39:24.760 --> 39:29.080]  he's bringing out hey hillary watch it you know your husband's a rapist hey bush don't say i'm not
[39:29.080 --> 39:33.720]  going to national security your brother let 911 happen watch out i mean he is doing everything
[39:33.720 --> 39:39.800]  you advised in your books that were written specifically uh as a playbook well that's a
[39:39.800 --> 39:44.920]  that's a kind interpretation nobody puts words in donald trump's mouth not even me we've been
[39:44.920 --> 39:50.280]  friends for almost 40 years but trump knows his own mind he's his own man you can recommend things
[39:50.280 --> 39:57.160]  for him to read he's a voracious reader but he is unscripted uncode no i understand it's just
[39:57.160 --> 40:02.200]  that you're really bringing him to the modern info war well he gets it i didn't have to tell him
[40:02.200 --> 40:07.400]  that the iraq war was a disaster he figured it out before yeah you're right absolutely uh and you
[40:07.400 --> 40:13.400]  don't have to tell him that there's many questions about 911 look we know that a number of the hijackers
[40:13.400 --> 40:19.240]  trained in tampa florida we know that the neighbors tipped the local police and the
[40:19.240 --> 40:25.080]  florida department of law enforcement under jab bush and what happened nothing instead
[40:25.080 --> 40:30.440]  jab bush helped the bin london's get on planes and get out of the country you know and for the
[40:30.440 --> 40:37.560]  bush uh blackies to now claim that it's outrageous look kondalisa rice had multiple warnings uh the
[40:37.560 --> 40:44.040]  central intelligence agency had multiple warnings the fbi had multiple warnings but within the
[40:44.040 --> 40:49.320]  bush administration they weren't speaking to each other that is a failure of leadership
[40:49.320 --> 40:54.680]  or it's willful one or the other whether it's incompetence or treason is meaningless
[40:54.680 --> 41:00.920]  at this point american interests were attacked in 3000 innocent americans died because of the
[41:00.920 --> 41:06.680]  policies of the bush administration it's a huge hardback available at info war store dot com
[41:07.240 --> 41:12.760]  it's also available at the stone zone dot com your website i don't care where you get it folks get
[41:12.760 --> 41:18.680]  both the bucks and give them to a brain dead rhino blue blood republican and say listen this is a
[41:18.680 --> 41:23.560]  high powered top republican strategist eight administrations worked inside four of them
[41:23.560 --> 41:28.840]  you know at the highest levels uh he and he's he's he's here explaining to you you know who these
[41:28.840 --> 41:33.800]  people really are this is huge you need to get both books and then give these liberal brainwash
[41:33.800 --> 41:37.800]  people who are going with identity politics very sexist that oh they're only vote for hillary
[41:37.800 --> 41:42.120]  because she's a woman give the book the clinton's war on women to these people and this is coming
[41:42.120 --> 41:47.000]  out just like you said six months ago it would this is what's hurting her on the campaign trail so
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  again you've been a major visionary mr stone i didn't say this when you were on with us five
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.640]  months ago i said you're really smart guy great guy you know but i mean really to watch how much
[41:55.640 --> 42:00.520]  what you've done and you're all over tv fighting and radio is really affecting things but the
[42:00.520 --> 42:05.480]  american people now are ready to listen i mean that shows there is a massive political revolt
[42:05.480 --> 42:09.640]  going on that that is only going to get bigger what do you expect the establishment to do
[42:10.760 --> 42:16.440]  well it's interesting they have tried at every turn to discredit trump uh he just he just does
[42:16.440 --> 42:22.680]  better and better he raises the question of 9 11 and the question of the origins of the iraq war
[42:22.680 --> 42:27.720]  in the last debate the house was stacked you could see that the republican national committee
[42:27.720 --> 42:32.840]  the south carolina republican party stacked the audience with rubio and bush supporters
[42:32.840 --> 42:38.520]  but those people booing the nord to trump's benefit because the television viewers across
[42:38.520 --> 42:45.240]  the country could see here's a guy standing up to the official false narrative of the american
[42:45.240 --> 42:52.440]  establishment trump's got enormous courage and enormous guts uh he is uh he is his own man he
[42:52.440 --> 42:58.360]  belongs to no special interest uh the uh the special interest particularly in the mainstream
[42:58.360 --> 43:04.120]  media they're apoplectic alex they don't know what to do they pulled out all the stops they
[43:04.120 --> 43:08.920]  called him a racist they called him a sexist they've called they tried to insinuate that he's
[43:08.920 --> 43:13.800]  associated with the mafia the new york the new york daily news is now saying he is the antichrist
[43:13.800 --> 43:20.440]  yeah look more zuckerman owns the new york daily news he's a very short guy he has no luck with
[43:20.440 --> 43:26.840]  women and he's very very jealous of donald trump who is tall and someone has the most beautiful wife
[43:26.840 --> 43:33.080]  on the planet so that's just pure jealousy it is they're jealous and i don't read the new york
[43:33.080 --> 43:38.280]  daily news anymore i prefer the new york post oh they've written the most salacious hit pieces on
[43:38.280 --> 43:43.640]  me but i just love it i mean they're so discredited it just they don't get whether it's seeing an
[43:43.640 --> 43:48.520]  or that when they attack me for example it only makes me more credible and everybody comes to
[43:48.520 --> 43:53.480]  actually hear what i really said don't they get that polls are running almost 90 shang they think
[43:53.480 --> 43:58.360]  there's foul play with scalia now what is your view on that i mean what a key time for him to die
[43:58.360 --> 44:04.120]  one of the great things ronald reagan did not a perfect uh justice but compared to you know compared
[44:04.120 --> 44:09.240]  to kagan and so the mayor and the socialist i mean we're in deep trouble we've got to get trump in i
[44:09.240 --> 44:14.120]  mean what type of supreme court court justice do you think he would appoint extra constructionist a
[44:14.120 --> 44:18.760]  real conservative uh he's not going to be tricked that i can assure you you're not going to get a
[44:18.760 --> 44:25.240]  david suitor uh from donald trump he's a hardliner on crime he wants somebody who follows the
[44:25.240 --> 44:31.480]  constitution as it was originally written not a living changing document because that's not what
[44:31.480 --> 44:37.560]  it is trump understands that the founding fathers had a specific idea of what the constitution is
[44:37.560 --> 44:42.360]  and he would appoint a justice who supports that view i had a great conversation yesterday with
[44:42.360 --> 44:47.720]  judge andrew napolitano one of the great patriots in this country a very close friend of antoni
[44:47.720 --> 44:55.080]  scalia antoni scalia he would like an autopsy it's common sense i don't think any of us are claiming
[44:55.080 --> 45:02.840]  false uh uh uh foul play we'd like to rule out foul play but common sense dictates that there
[45:02.840 --> 45:09.720]  be some investigation and some autopsy to make sure this wasn't another coup d'etat so an sop
[45:09.720 --> 45:15.240]  gets ignored at every level that there's some red flags there well we've had coup d'etats in this
[45:15.240 --> 45:21.560]  country we had one on november 22nd 1963 we had another one at the time of watergate this could
[45:21.560 --> 45:28.280]  very well be yet another coup d'etat the reagan brother the day reagan was shot the night before
[45:28.280 --> 45:34.920]  and this is on record folks the bushes were meeting uh with the hinkley family i mean you
[45:34.920 --> 45:39.160]  cannot that was in the denver post folks and i believe from the evidence you were in that
[45:39.160 --> 45:43.880]  administration that they were trying to kill reagan well at a minimum uh they were trying
[45:43.880 --> 45:47.560]  to kill them or they were trying to warn him people don't understand the backstory here but
[45:47.560 --> 45:51.960]  it's very simple there was a struggle going on within the reggae administration which was brand
[45:51.960 --> 45:58.280]  new between secretary of state out haig a patriot uh and a man who quaintly believed that ronald
[45:58.280 --> 46:03.960]  reagan's secretary of state should control foreign policy and george hw bush who won control
[46:03.960 --> 46:10.040]  specifically of aran contra uh and of our international policy so he could implement
[46:10.600 --> 46:16.840]  the new world order both those executive orders were drafted he drafted his giving him control
[46:16.840 --> 46:23.160]  bush drafted his giving him control and they sat on reagan's desk and they sat there and they sat
[46:23.160 --> 46:29.320]  there then there was an attempt on reagan's life now i established in my book that there's a second
[46:29.320 --> 46:35.480]  gunman i also established that the bullet that hits reagan comes from an upward trajectory
[46:35.480 --> 46:42.120]  yet hinkley is crouching in a low position um the idea that a bullet ricocheted off the door of
[46:42.120 --> 46:48.040]  the car hit reagan that's a great idea but there's no knit or dent or evidence of that the five
[46:48.040 --> 46:53.800]  bullets that are shot by hinkley jr are all accounted for none of them hit ronald it's just
[46:53.800 --> 46:58.360]  like sir hand sir hand that's why your book jeb and the bush crime family i could not put it down
[46:58.360 --> 47:03.960]  it tells all of this the whole history back to jfk it's amazing bush's son was to dine with
[47:03.960 --> 47:08.120]  suspect's brother uh that's the uh houston post they found a different one but you can find the
[47:08.120 --> 47:14.200]  Denver post where he did dine with him just days before i mean what are the chances of that well
[47:14.200 --> 47:21.640]  not only that but john hinkley senior a major financier george bush's campaigns in 1964 1960
[47:21.640 --> 47:28.360]  was involved in a lot of clandestine ops 1980 and hinkley senior is a cia guy yeah he's running
[47:28.360 --> 47:34.360]  an offshore oil company at the same time george hw bush is running zapata and those companies are
[47:34.360 --> 47:40.120]  really just structured so they can make payoffs before what is the payoff to you have your son
[47:40.120 --> 47:43.960]  locked up for decades i guess they're gonna let him out now but just to be the patsy that is a
[47:43.960 --> 47:49.320]  dedicated group of people right there well remember no matter what you may have read the cia director
[47:49.320 --> 47:54.920]  bill casey did not have a high regard for george bush thought he was a lightweight so bush could
[47:54.920 --> 48:00.360]  not count on his cronies in the central entail intelligence agency to take a shot at raiden
[48:00.360 --> 48:06.920]  so they went to the only asset they had john hinkley junior is a troubled black sheep son of a friend
[48:06.920 --> 48:13.720]  he's perfect now as you may know alex uh he actually is quoted in his interview in an interview
[48:13.720 --> 48:20.280]  as saying that he shot raiden so that his uncle george bush could become president not his blood
[48:20.280 --> 48:26.920]  uncle but it shows the closeness of the relationship with the clinton's call call call bush family he
[48:26.920 --> 48:33.160]  calls them brother it's totally sick uh i want to accelerate to south carolina what we do uh how the
[48:33.160 --> 48:38.360]  numbers are looking i mean am i wrong that trump's gaining in south carolina are those polls accurate
[48:38.360 --> 48:43.160]  and then what do you make of the pope waiting in i mean the catholics are great people a lot of my
[48:43.160 --> 48:47.800]  friends are catholic nothing a lot of great popes but this guy i mean he's gone too far in my view
[48:47.800 --> 48:53.000]  getting involved in our politics and and you know saying that trump isn't a christian i have a very
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  good feeling about south carolina i feel even better since our friend richard breeze is out there
[48:57.000 --> 49:02.440]  keeping an eye on things i think trump is on the move i think he's gaining i think that the mainstream
[49:02.440 --> 49:08.600]  media tats of him have backfired everybody said his raising the question of 911 and the iraq war
[49:08.600 --> 49:14.440]  would hurt him hasn't hurt him at all americans are suspicious about both of those they want to hear
[49:14.440 --> 49:21.720]  more i think he's on a roll now uh fortunately for us the anti trump's vote is split between bush
[49:21.720 --> 49:29.000]  and casik and rubio therefore the only guy who can hurt donald trump in south carolina is ted
[49:29.000 --> 49:35.320]  cruz not because cruz can defeat trump because he can't but he could siphon valuable votes from
[49:35.320 --> 49:40.760]  trump that allow a marco rubio to emerge now i can tell you i've got a lot of friends in the
[49:40.760 --> 49:46.200]  establishment i eat with them i drink with them i laugh at them uh but they've all switched to rubio
[49:46.200 --> 49:53.080]  they've all switched to rubio he is the establishment candidate they've given up jeb for dead too low
[49:53.080 --> 49:59.320]  energy too boring too much baggage so despite that hundred million dollars in wall street money
[49:59.320 --> 50:06.360]  trust me rubio is the is the uh is the candidate of the establishment i feared ted cruz is a
[50:06.360 --> 50:12.200]  manchurian canadian candidate put in this race to siphon from donald trump he has no general
[50:12.200 --> 50:17.640]  election appeal he has no let me expand on that because i i wanted to believe in ted cruz and
[50:17.640 --> 50:22.520]  obviously i like what he says what he stands for but but he he he has been caught pulling dirty
[50:22.520 --> 50:27.320]  tricks a bunch of them and and donald trump hasn't done that and you know i don't like we did to
[50:27.320 --> 50:31.800]  karsten and i don't like how he spun it and everything i mean clearly that was a dirty trick
[50:31.800 --> 50:35.800]  it's what you'd think the bushes would do and then i think about how he's praised kissinger
[50:35.800 --> 50:39.800]  he's praised the bushes and i really think now because they know they can't run the bush name
[50:39.800 --> 50:45.400]  anymore more and more i think from the cfr and from uh you know these other connections goldman
[50:45.400 --> 50:51.560]  sacks it looks like cruise could be their sock puppet yeah i look like you i was initially
[50:51.560 --> 50:56.120]  attracted to ted cruz i like what he had to say i like this message i like to standing up for the
[50:56.120 --> 51:02.680]  us constitution and then i looked a little closer he was george w bush's top issue advisor his wife
[51:02.680 --> 51:08.040]  heidi cruz i'm sure she's a nice lady she was a deputy to condoleezza rice when they got us into
[51:08.040 --> 51:13.320]  this phony war then she went over to the us trade representative's office where she was the deputy
[51:13.320 --> 51:19.240]  us trade representative in the bush administration where she worked specifically on china policy our
[51:19.240 --> 51:26.520]  current china trade policy she's a member of the council on foreign relations now you add the shady
[51:26.520 --> 51:34.120]  secret low interest wall street loans from goldman sacks and city bank uh that uh that funded ted
[51:34.120 --> 51:41.320]  cruz's campaign for the senate i have to believe he's a trojan horse clever slick articulate but a
[51:41.320 --> 51:47.400]  bush republican and we don't need more of them we need to end their reign as pat bucannon says
[51:48.120 --> 51:53.800]  pat's saying good stuff about uh trump now and i mean ideologically i think he's basically you
[51:53.800 --> 51:58.520]  know the godson of uh people like bary goldwater and richard nixon i think that's a that's a big
[51:58.520 --> 52:04.360]  plus as well yeah now pat's piece is a terrific piece and he's exactly right what we see right now
[52:04.920 --> 52:10.520]  is the rejection of bush republicanism they have opened our board borders to criminals they've
[52:10.520 --> 52:16.840]  destroyed our our finances they have plunged us into debt they have bailed out their their friends
[52:16.840 --> 52:22.200]  on wall street at our expense uh they've destroyed our trade policy with other countries so that
[52:22.200 --> 52:27.560]  we're constantly on the short end of the stick donald trump is the last best hope for the
[52:27.560 --> 52:31.960]  salvation of this country well isn't that presidential that they have to bring in this
[52:31.960 --> 52:36.200]  radical change agent pope they've had a coup in the vatican uh with blackmail that's even
[52:36.200 --> 52:39.560]  come out in the london guardian kicking the other guy out sending him to gandalf castle
[52:39.560 --> 52:44.200]  that's never happened in 2000 years of pubs i mean all this craziness is happening right now and
[52:44.200 --> 52:49.960]  this guy's saying donald trump's the devil when he's behind 200 foot walls i mean it's just it
[52:49.960 --> 52:55.400]  people see through this i mean it they are the power structure is hysterical now you talked about
[52:55.400 --> 52:59.320]  a bulletproof vest anybody can look and see he's wearing one but the ignorant public says
[52:59.320 --> 53:02.680]  what's that under his shirt why doesn't he button it well he's wearing a thick bulletproof vest and
[53:02.680 --> 53:08.200]  more carrying a gun now they criticize him for that i mean the disconnect this guy's a hero
[53:08.200 --> 53:12.920]  he's under amazing danger he's willing to talk about the elephant in the room saudi arabia the
[53:12.920 --> 53:17.400]  911 stand down that will bring down the clinton's on the bushes i mean when he did that and really
[53:17.400 --> 53:23.080]  gotten tense the last week it brought tears to my eyes and i just i'm so glad i backed trump
[53:23.080 --> 53:28.760]  he's the real deal there's no way he's an establishment scammer they would not let him do this they i
[53:28.760 --> 53:33.320]  can look at their body language they are crapping their pants mr stone and for lack of a better
[53:33.320 --> 53:39.640]  term they are scared to death like vampires being hauled out at high noon uh i am really
[53:39.640 --> 53:44.280]  concerned about donald trump right now i've got to be honest i'm not fear mongering uh i think
[53:44.280 --> 53:50.120]  he's the most uh under threat man on earth right now yeah look he's very courageous he's very brave
[53:50.120 --> 53:55.160]  he's very brave my wife and i pray for him every night because clearly uh he is threatening the
[53:55.160 --> 54:01.320]  establishment where they live wait until he starts talking about monetary policy i know his views
[54:01.320 --> 54:08.040]  he wants a sound dollar he's not a big fan of the fed so um he is scaring the central bankers he is
[54:08.040 --> 54:16.600]  scaring scaring the washington wall street dc consultant lobbyist class uh permanent government
[54:16.600 --> 54:21.560]  class that's hijacked the country is scared to death yes tell us his views that's the one question
[54:21.560 --> 54:26.440]  when he was on always probably coming on soon the the one question i can get to is what is his
[54:26.440 --> 54:31.080]  view on auditing the fed and another question i want him to talk about is would he try to in the
[54:31.080 --> 54:37.400]  persecution of the christian church with the irs and specifically try to point out that 501c3
[54:37.400 --> 54:42.840]  doesn't muzzle free speech i think the answer on all three is yes first of all he's already talked
[54:42.840 --> 54:49.240]  about repealing some of the irs ordinance is put in kate in place ironically by linden johnson
[54:49.240 --> 54:55.960]  to muzzle christian organizations from criticizing his administration back in the 60s those regulations
[54:55.960 --> 55:01.880]  are still in place and they're being used to muzzle christians as far as banks does anyone know banks
[55:01.880 --> 55:07.800]  better than donald trump he has led the new york banks around by the nose as trump continues to say
[55:07.800 --> 55:13.960]  in our trade negotiations we have the leverage we just don't know how to use it we send social
[55:13.960 --> 55:18.920]  workers out to do our negotiating instead of hard-nosed business people donald trump could
[55:18.920 --> 55:25.400]  revolutionize this country he is deeply suspicious of the fed and i think he is open-minded about
[55:25.400 --> 55:32.520]  the fed i suspect you get an audit of the fed uh he's never said that but i know his views uh and
[55:32.520 --> 55:37.960]  he is uh he doesn't trust anything he's harry adder washington that's for sure he recognizes
[55:37.960 --> 55:45.080]  a broken system uh he is uh the last best chance for reform do you so uh what's a big win because
[55:45.080 --> 55:49.240]  they've already said if he doesn't win by 20 extra points in south carolina he's a loser you know i
[55:49.240 --> 55:53.640]  guess we won by 100 he'd be a loser if he doesn't win by a big margin nevada he's a loser i mean
[55:53.640 --> 55:58.760]  obviously that spin's not going to work but in your real political calculus mr stone you know
[55:58.760 --> 56:05.080]  what is a win versus something that's a draw how big a win does he need uh look i i think a win is
[56:05.080 --> 56:09.320]  a win and a is a win at the end of the day if he wins by one vote that's still for first place
[56:09.320 --> 56:14.600]  absolutely i think he gets in over 30 percent and that's comfortable fabulous i have much greater
[56:14.600 --> 56:19.240]  concern about nevada i want to be candid about this first of all it's not a primary it's a caucus
[56:19.240 --> 56:24.760]  and they're known for hanky-panky there and there's a disproportionate Mormon influence uh just because
[56:24.760 --> 56:29.960]  the makeup almost seven out of ten primary voters will be a members of the church of latter day
[56:29.960 --> 56:37.000]  saints uh they are firmly behind marco rubio the political establishment in the state is firmly
[56:37.000 --> 56:43.320]  behind marco rubio ted cruise has been slowing getting off the ground there which is good because
[56:43.320 --> 56:50.280]  there's less of a drain on donald trump but uh i'm far more concerned about nevada than i am about
[56:50.280 --> 56:57.080]  south carolina i feel a big victory coming on saturday i think jeb is on his last legs i know a lot
[56:57.080 --> 57:02.440]  of the bush money people are now advising the family to pull the plug on jeb's candidacy
[57:02.440 --> 57:08.280]  remains to be seen whether that really happens but uh we are on our way on the other hand unlike
[57:08.280 --> 57:14.440]  reagan the establishment will never throw in the towel they will monkey with the rules at this
[57:14.440 --> 57:20.120]  convention they will seek to change the rules to allow a white knight who has no delegates to
[57:20.120 --> 57:26.360]  be nominated maybe uh omit romney or maybe we bring back some combination of romney and rubio
[57:26.360 --> 57:31.080]  but you can count on monkey business at the republican convention the establishment will
[57:31.080 --> 57:37.080]  not give up the ghost until donald trump puts his hand on the bible and takes the oath you know what
[57:37.080 --> 57:40.040]  i know you've got to go because you're you're you're really busy fighting we've got to go to

[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:59.160]  were raped or attacked or assaulted uh those women are getting organized and i think a
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:04.680]  number of them are going to speak out uh this fall one particular woman i want to talk about

[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:48.440]  a substantial amount of money trump is himself a contributor i'm not ready to disclose what he
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:54.280]  has given uh and many many okay so that go fund me is only one thing that is only one receptacle

[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.320]  fight right to the clinton's well you're certainly uh fighting hard i gotta say i'm not just bragging
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.240]  or you're trying to act like we're heroes because we're not we're just fighting this but this is
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.280]  dangerous what i'm doing is dangerous what you're doing it's about 50 times more dangerous for
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.200]  donald trump uh i mean i hope folks out there haven't been involved in politics at this level
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.840]  understand this is not a game we're fighting a mafia we've got 60 seconds left sir final comments
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.560]  uh look i think that the emphasis now needs to be on nevada if you have friends in nevada if you
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:52.680]  know people in nevada you have cousins or relatives in nevada get in touch with them that is where the
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:58.200]  establishment is going to try to short circuit donald trump he's going to win set in south carolina
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.240]  when george w was in the state they had to bust people in to fill out the crowd the bushes have
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:08.600]  worn out their welcome americans want another bush like we want another clinton which is to say
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:15.800]  not at all this this is the last best hope for american democracy that donald trump is a
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:22.600]  nationalist he believes in american sovereignty uh he would appoint a justices in supreme court
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:29.240]  that alex you and i would be proud of this fight is now it is today and victory is this close
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.160]  and that's why it's suspicious that's khalia died and even more suspicious they say that we're not
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:38.760]  supposed to ask questions indeed very very suspicious look perhaps it's entirely innocent
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.960]  yes that's possible i just like to know for sure i'd like to see a full investigation
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:48.760]  not a warren commission type investigation and i'd like to see an autopsy i think any
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:55.320]  clear thinking reasonable american yes sir the wisdom of that position roger stone godspeed
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:01.240]  thank you so much sir alex i'll see you next friday north korea sir thank you planning a terrorist
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:07.800]  attack on south korea this according to the national intelligence service that says north korea's
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:14.200]  leader kim jong-un gave the order to begin preparations the niss warning covered a large
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:20.840]  number of possible targets including subways shopping malls and even a nuclear power plant
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:26.360]  all key lines of communication between north and south korea have been cut off i've long
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:31.160]  predicted my world affairs briefs that new in north korean attack on south korea will be a
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:36.520]  trigger event for world war three and you'll probably have a nuclear emp and nuclear strike

[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:17.640]  defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their

[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:40.200]  a recent headline on the drudge report reads europe on the brink of new refugee swarm which
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:45.000]  links back to a washington post article spring could bring a fresh surge of refugees but europe
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.680]  isn't ready for them last week february 10th 2016 george soros wrote an opinion piece for the
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:55.720]  website project syndicate dot com flatly blaming vladimir putin for the refugee crisis across
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:09:00.600]  europe soros wrote putin's current aim is to foster the eu's disintegration and the best way to do
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:05.320]  so is flood the eu with syrian refugees ironically enough prior to this statement soros had been
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.720]  one of the most outspoken advocates for nations across europe to help with the middle east crisis
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.600]  by creating a stable plan for accepting refugees into their societies now let's review a few key
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.800]  statements leading up to soros's remarks last week in september of 2015 months before the russian
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.840]  action against isis soros posted this article on project syndicate dot com rebuilding the asylum
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.040]  system he actually says the eu needs a comprehensive plan to respond to the crisis one that reasserts
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.520]  effective governance over the flows of asylum seekers so that they can take place in a safe
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:39.240]  orderly way and a pace that reflects europe's capacity to absorb them hungarian prime minister
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:43.880]  victor orban responded to soros statement in october by accusing him of using the migrants as

[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:59.000]  continent will no longer be for those citizens living here then in mid november 2015 putin
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.240]  launched his offensive against isis it appears that soros completely changed his position blaming
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.240]  the refugee crisis entirely on the russian military action which of course makes no
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:11.720]  chronological sense there certainly is a lot of finger pointing over what appears to be who is at
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.920]  fault for carrying out the agenda to move a third world refugee population into europe to permanently
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:21.720]  alter european life as we know it if we draw a line back to count richard coden have collergy
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:26.200]  known for being the founder of the first popular united europe movement the pan europea movement
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:30.440]  collergy called for a united europe to counter a growing russian threat his vision was the united
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.240]  states of europe which would eventually expand into a complete world order and will be populated by
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:40.040]  culturally homogenized people collergy envisioned a world where migrant races will be integrated
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:45.240]  into europe europe would therefore be populated by the man of the future collergy wrote the man of
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:50.120]  the future will be of mixed race today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.840]  vanishing space time and prejudice the eurasian negroid race of the future similar in its appearance
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.560]  to the ancient egyptians will replace the diversity of peoples with the diversity of individuals
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:03.960]  interestingly enough soros remains a supporter and activist for the european union he recently
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:08.440]  warned that german austerity policies which he originally pushed for will be ultimately responsible
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.320]  for an e u failure so as we see the refugee crisis escalate throughout europe we can also draw
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:18.120]  parallels from history which present a clearer explanation for the present situation soros is
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:22.600]  simply carrying forward the progressive agenda of his forerunner the plan for a united europe has
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.800]  always included an agenda for what collergy described as the eurasian negroid race of the future
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.960]  many experts have already warned that the refugee crisis threatens to bring european culture to its
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:37.240]  knees if the situation is not brought under control soon the end of some however represents the beginning
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:42.760]  of a new world order as the winter ice thaws will we see a new surge in the collergy plan or will
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.400]  the nation states of europe begin to control their own borders rob do reporting for info wars

[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:18.600]  in to say that yes donald trump isn't a lot of danger and he went on to just just just talk about
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:25.400]  so many amazing things and he said scalia without doing the uh investigation with the mysterious
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:31.960]  death could be a coup d'etat pretty big interview in the last hour now we're going to briefly pop

[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:48.600]  nevada and of course uh the situation with south carolina that's all coming up saturday night uh
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:54.760]  peter schiff on the melting down world economy and the chinese government trying to buy the stock

[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:13.480]  bigs wane madson in studio david night all of them in the fourth hour back from their in-depth
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:20.360]  investigation confrontations you name it going into judges chambers um droning the property
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:26.520]  just amazing speaking of drones i've got news on that today's the day it starts that even a two
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.520]  pound drone or is it half pound drone i had the new york times this morning i didn't see it in my
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:35.560]  stack do you guys give me that yep no it's a half pound drone the littlest ones at the store that
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:41.560]  your kid gets that fly 10 feet in the air or you know half a pound federal crime if you don't
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.400]  register them and then once they're registered they admit they're going to ban you flying them
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.960]  and now they're going to ban gas powered planes i was flying when i was a kid so they use a few bad
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:56.040]  people flying drones around you know and crashing them at the white house little toys to take all
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:02.760]  of our rights that's another uh big big example no you prosecute that person but but anyways the
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.880]  the high dollar drones we've been buying they're like three four thousand dollars you know it's
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:10.200]  super expensive you get twenty thousand dollar ones that we've been getting great shots and
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:15.080]  great investigations with they already have geolocation in them where they won't even get
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:20.600]  near the capital in fact i want to take the drones out and show people they've got geolocation in
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:25.000]  their chips and with your cell phone that controls them or with the controller we have three different
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.240]  drones where it will not go into certain areas and so that's another example of smart cars and
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:35.640]  smart tech in the future total control they just put another program in and you can't drive your car
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:42.680]  i mean think of the level of control this technocracy brings and all the new cars coming out
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.920]  already have the quote smart car stuff in and the quote stops you before you rear in somebody or
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:54.120]  takes control this is the beginning of the ai takeover and it's a very very serious situation
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:17:01.240]  so a ton of big news coming up for the latest from south carolina richard reeves by the way i like
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:07.240]  the peter prince uh haircut the blackwater haircut you look sharp richard i like that you're there
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.000]  with a big old cannon in the background you got a aircraft carrier there in the background
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.560]  looks like a fourth of july or something uh what has developed since we checked in with you yesterday
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:20.920]  well alex more has developed than we have time to even talk about we are here at patreon's point
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:26.440]  right behind me is the uss york town and the main difference between that ship that is now a museum
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:32.520]  and the glp establishment is that it sits upright and it's afloat because the glp establishment is
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:36.760]  in big trouble buddy and it's good news for us because one thing at roger stone didn't get to
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.200]  mention because he didn't know about it because i know the mainstream media doesn't want to talk
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:46.920]  about it is because marco rubio pulled another big giant absentee showing last night they had in
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:52.840]  greenville south carolina they had a three candidate event with marco rubio scheduled with
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:18:02.600]  ted Cruz and ben carson 5000 ardent conservatives showed up and marco rubio went out he was afraid
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:08.360]  it was too much ted Cruz in the crowd he's backed out of that event and we know he did because what
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:14.840]  happened was is matt my cameraman and i we were at rubio event earlier in the day trade gaudy
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:21.640]  tim scott senator tim scott from south carolina and the governor of south carolina they were all
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:27.560]  tied at the hip with marco rubio all day long well tim scott and trade gaudy for sure showed up at
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:32.840]  that event last night and they were willing to be surrogates in marco rubio's place and to the event
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:37.400]  of the credit to the credit of the organizers of the event they said no because they had disallowed
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:42.040]  a surrogate for jeb bush days ago they said no we're not having so the big angle is rubio
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:50.440]  a no show chickens out of debate rubio pete's pants that well that's right you know he's famous for
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:55.240]  being absent on senate votes well i'll tell you what what's going to happen when he has a face down
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:00.760]  with putin or some other important world leader so let's not forget this because i don't even ask
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:07.400]  for christmas presents unbelievable so obviously i've had alex has this been reported in the
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:12.280]  national president austin at all no i would get the the data over one of our riders and have
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.160]  him get a story of that that's it well i did that we uploaded a video earlier talking about it
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:22.920]  and so that's posted now but uh it's called uh another bona fide for trump another absence for
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.920]  rubio so folks watch that youtube video on the alex johnson we're sure we're going to break what
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:30.600]  else are we learning i mean i see the polls are all over the place do you think it's accurate that
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:36.360]  trump is still gaining more and more every day well thank you pope thank you pope that's another
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.520]  thing south carolina christians are pretty offended over the pope's comments that trump's
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:45.800]  not a christian because conservatives here they want a wall too they want illegal immigration
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:52.520]  controlled so they took it as a personal offense alex so well it is and look obama
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.760]  has arrested and audited christians that say they don't like abortion saying they have no free speech

[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:29.480]  actually thousands last week have this line that he's an internet only host as if that would be bad
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.800]  that i was successful and that the truth was successful whether it was in a book or on the
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:43.240]  internet or in a play or you know what's informative is informative and he has a red face
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:50.200]  he had a spot on his forehead they actually said that newsweek and he said watch out there may not
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:57.320]  be a autopsy and then they're one he even questioned before it happened yeah i smelled a rat so they're
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:03.160]  there to invert reality and train people that if you're informed and right that's weird but to have
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.480]  this pope who i've investigated deeply who they admit basically had a black male cuda tog against
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:15.400]  the vatican and uh took out rat singer now he's in there and he's making his move calling for
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.320]  world government you name it and then hillary praises him and then attacks bernie sanders
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:25.560]  and gets booed that's coming up but yeah richard seeing what i'm seeing but he's in south carolina
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:30.280]  following it exclusively i'm following nationally but it looks like he got a boost
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:35.880]  in the polls in his lead from this so thank you pope for lecturing us but i was making the point
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.120]  as went to break richard they persecute the christian church here in america across the board
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:46.440]  unless it's leftist they don't give you 501c3 or they revoke it or they audit you if you say
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:50.200]  that you don't like abortion well that's your free speech but then it's okay for the pope
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:55.960]  to get involved in our election though richard reeves no absolutely the irony is just unbelievable
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:02.440]  the pope came out yesterday and they had the little battle with trump and like say listening
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.960]  to people here on the ground talking to people here on the ground listening to the talk radio
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.920]  locally the people were pretty offended so that's just going to push more people into the the trump
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.480]  camp and the cruise camp those are the big two now i think that big mistake here in south carolina
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:20.840]  last night by marco rubio not showing up literally i mean they're saying he got stuck in traffic
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:26.440]  we know that hey how does trey gowdy get there how does uh senator tim scott get there how does
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:30.440]  governor nicky hayley get there to this event and then all of a sudden marco rubio is not there
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.160]  somehow when we know they're tied at the hip all day so we know that's not true supposedly he was
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:41.320]  at a frank lens of it we've got a helicopter coming in for a landing here at patrice point but anyway
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.480]  another piece of big news is let's say in that camera let's see that while you're talking we want to
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:50.920]  see that helicopter show them show them the chopper coming in it's a tourist chopper that's awesome
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:57.240]  yeah tourist man i tell you it's like hd skype right now this is a really amazing radio slash tv
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:01.960]  transmission i can't believe how info wars has grown and folks i'm not bragging here i'm just
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:06.200]  marveling at what you the listeners have built spreading the word your support you are this
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:11.880]  operation and i'm not just saying that to patch you on the head i mean you are it richard i don't
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:17.000]  know the listeners understand how important they are you can't hear with the helicopter ask me one
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.080]  more time there no no richard any other key points you want to make about south carolina and what the
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:27.560]  numbers seem to be right now well i think that uh trump plus or minus 40 percent gonna be the winner
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:32.840]  cruise second place somewhere marco rubio i think he might have been able to challenge cruise i think
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:36.680]  with last night's episode and what they call the upstate of south carolina i think that's
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:41.320]  going to hurt him bad i think literally i think literally we will be able to look at a south
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:48.520]  carolina county by county precinct voter map and see the effect of marco rubio standing up that huge
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:53.240]  crowd last night and the word in the upstate is going to be buzzing all around now the other big
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:58.840]  news is we did see the establishment rallying their forces around marco rubio the big endorsement
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:04.600]  by nikki haley the governor on wednesday uh you know was the real tip-off finally i mean there was
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.640]  other tip-offs there was senator tim scott endorsing rubio we had traig gowdy endorsing rubio and he
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:14.280]  been rising up in polls until the endorsements correct so the kiss of death is the establishment
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:19.080]  endorsing you right well you know nikki haley endorsing me it was actually it wasn't good
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:23.000]  for rubio necessarily it helped him a little bit but i'll tell you who it was the kiss of death for
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.040]  i can tell you exactly who it was it was a kiss of death for bush it was the kiss of death for
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:33.320]  jeb bush they were counting they were praying and hoping and counting and doing their hellmarys and
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:39.320]  counting their rosary trying to get the endorsement of nikki haley for the jeb camp and it didn't happen
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:45.800]  so ironically i in just complete irony nikki haley might be the nail in the coffin for the bush dynasty
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:49.800]  i agree with you we got one minute left for us you don't let you get back on the trail so much
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:55.400]  is happening what other tidbits do you have for us well we are working on that delicate story
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:00.760]  as roger said yesterday or just earlier in the show look at the delegate strategy is in full play
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:05.560]  we'll especially see it oh and another thing he talked about nevada nevada is very important
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:12.680]  info warriors you know the ron paulers caused so much they almost took over nevada in 2012 alex
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.480]  they need to show up because what happened is they couldn't even complete their convention in 2012
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:22.520]  because the ron paulers were just like 48 percent or 51 they were real close to being the majority
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:26.920]  so the establishment just shut down the convention and i don't even know what the outcome
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:31.560]  that's right and it's the hanky panky that we've seen in the last two primaries we're going to be
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:36.040]  watching and ritchie grief is going to be there tonight tomorrow sunday on the sunday show covering

[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:13.160]  me level with you america here's just a small sampling of hillary's whoppers there's the
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:18.600]  Benghazi hearing using a secret private server to hide her activities lying about not sharing
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:23.080]  classified information on that secret server using the clinton foundation as a cover for
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:27.720]  tax evasion and taking bribes from foreign countries she claims to be against the big banks
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:33.000]  but won't release transcripts of the speeches she made to those banks who paid her hefty speaking
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.360]  fees whitewater watergate defending a rapist threatening all of bill's bimbos in an effort

[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:15.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:25.400]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones i could get hundreds and hundreds
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:31.160]  and hundreds of brokerage firm owners and and economists and people that go on cnbc
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:37.240]  or fox business on this show all day but most of them are wrong about 80 of the time because i
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:43.560]  do watch those shows but it's just like amateurish compared to what people could be hearing now
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:47.880]  peter shift goes on a lot of those shows and when he does he's usually the odd man out but when i
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:53.560]  have some money on like a harry dent or a peter shift or a max keiser you know they're right
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:58.440]  like 80 to 90 percent of the time or more and the media makes a huge deal out of it when they're
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:02.920]  wrong you know five ten percent of the time on average maybe every once in a while ten percent
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:07.320]  wrong because i really been following this i read the financial papers i high track what's
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:13.640]  happening mainstream media doesn't want to tell you the truth in my experience and it's rewarded
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:16.920]  a fantasy land for so long that a lot of people i think are drinking their own koolag and really
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:23.080]  believe the kenzie in economics they push i'm not saying austrian economics is perfect no model is
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:27.480]  but it's it makes a lot more sense when i've seen historically uh than than what they're
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:33.240]  shoveling at us so i gotta say one of the only thing shifts was quasi i i guess you can say
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:38.760]  wrong about was he kept saying goals and i go up goes and go up probably and it has now but he was
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.600]  right about what was going to happen how things would unfold uh what he thought they'd do with
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:47.400]  rates a small cut and then maybe try to go back it's all happening so i don't know who's more
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:54.040]  accurate dent or ship it doesn't matter because they're more generally accurate in a whole
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:35:01.480]  other universe than the other people i mean like aron paul is more accurate by light years
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:05.240]  than the competition so we're going to be talking to him about all these huge developments
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:10.280]  where he sees the economy going now uh really how bad is it because they've been saying everything's
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:15.480]  fine for years when it's been going in the crapper and the water's rising we're like one of the
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:20.600]  highest islands but still it's rising some countries are under water what does he think's
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.680]  coming next we're going to talk to peter shift here in just a moment from euro pack dot com and
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:28.440]  no stranger to this show or pretty much anybody out there so there's no need to go over his bio
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:33.160]  for you but he has billions under management his father's very famous political prisoner who died
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:40.120]  last year very very sad but before we go any further super male vitality is just known
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:46.360]  concentrated herbs that basically from dr grips research all in those it works blocks a lot of
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:51.720]  the estrogen mimicers and just stimulates your natural glands it it it it doesn't simulate
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:55.800]  testosterone or other things it just stimulates your glands that's why i've lost so much weight
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:00.040]  i've gotten so healthy it's just amazing with this and the other products and in fours life dot
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:04.920]  com here's the problem it will be sold out at current sales rates by tomorrow so the special
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:09.480]  ends now 20 off is now over it'll be sold out guaranteed in the next few days even though
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:13.160]  i've raised the price back up to normal i'm a capitalist and we need the funding to operate
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:18.200]  i'm not ashamed of that super female 20 off is still there because we've got a decent supply
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:22.440]  of that at least a few weeks super male could be out for months because these are wet herbs
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:28.680]  they're cold pressed they're very hard to source believe me we'd rather just have stuff in stock
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:36.120]  all the time it is available at info wars life dot com also andro plex is selling out you'll
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:41.080]  have to sign up for auto ship you get 10 off we're holding some back for folks that are an auto ship
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:45.640]  because once you have auto ship you can't ever sell out so now we have to always hold back
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.880]  whatever amount of people are signed up for something on auto ship so by tomorrow the only
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:54.600]  way to get in through a plex will be via auto ship you'll still get 10 off it's similar to super
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.640]  male but has some different factors and is kind of a base for the super male super female also the
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:04.600]  big liver cleanse we have informational videos about it with the oxy powder and the apple cider
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:10.360]  vinegar that we don't sell you take that for a week we have the formula up there and just most
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:17.320]  people i'd say 99 percent you've seen the 4.8 star reviews have explosive results when i say
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.960]  explosive i mean there's a lot of stuff in the gallbladder and the liver uh and uh boy did it
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:27.080]  work for me leon macadoo and others rob do lost 12 pounds of detritus that was in him check out
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:32.680]  the informational videos info wars life dot com it's been out of stock for two months and it's
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:40.040]  back and check out the advanced liver cleanse as well now peter shiff one of the most accurate
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:46.200]  people in my 20 years on air i mean i remember in the last 15 years or so seeing him on cnbc
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:51.400]  and fox business and stuff but very accurate predicted a lot of things went contrary into the
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:56.840]  system and he's been saying hey this is going to melt down this isn't going to work qe you know
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:00.680]  he predicted that they would just do a small increase he predicted when they would do it
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:03.800]  he's made a lot of accurate predictions he doesn't want to disarm i think it's important if
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:07.800]  he goes over those for new listeners because so many new tv stations and radio stations are
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:13.240]  picking a stuff that may not watch the financial shows and then what he predicted in the collapse
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:17.960]  now beginning to come true and how bad he really thinks it is versus what they're saying i have a
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.360]  lot of questions i want to move quick with him your opac dot com peter thank you for coming on
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:28.120]  with us thanks alex where do you want to start i mean there's just so much happening yeah you

[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:37.480]  internet program a peter shiff show or whenever they will occasionally invite me on uh you know
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:44.040]  conventional uh television you know all this stuff is now starting to to happen it's starting to unfold
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:49.240]  the mainstream still doesn't understand i think they still think oh maybe the fed made a mistake
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:54.920]  maybe they shouldn't have raised rates that wasn't the mistake the mistake was lowering them to zero
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:59.960]  in the first place the minute they did that that they sealed our fate it didn't matter when they
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:04.760]  raised rates the minute they would do it everything was going to fall apart because this was a phony
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:09.800]  recovery it was a bubble and the fact that they waited so long means that the bubble is that much
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:15.080]  bigger which means it's that much more problematic when it pops i think what we're staring at right
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:20.280]  now unless the fed quickly backtracks and cuts rates and does qe4 which i think they're going
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:24.680]  to do they may even go negative but i think we're going to have a worse financial crisis than the
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:31.080]  one we had in 2008 but if the fed does what i think it's going to do to try to prevent that crisis
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:36.120]  then they're actually going to usher in something much worse in the form of a dollar crisis which
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:41.320]  is going to be much worse than just a general financial crisis they could finally kill the
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:48.520]  dollar because the conventional wisdom is that we're the worst we're the best house in a bad
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:54.520]  neighborhood but at the same time it's got to give someday and it just can't go on forever and it
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:59.320]  appears that's beginning to crack with all the big banks and the royal bank of scotland and
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:04.040]  sorrows saying panic it's over everything's going to collapse it almost makes me then ask
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:09.080]  what do they think they're doing well they have no idea but you know the only reason
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:15.320]  that the dollar has risen these past several years although it's now falling so far in 2016
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:20.520]  but the reason it rose is because everybody was convinced that what the fed did actually worked
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.080]  that we had a real recovery and that the fed was going to be able to raise rates i knew all along
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:29.560]  that that wasn't true and i actually thought the federal reserve was smart enough not to raise
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:33.720]  rates but they proved me wrong on that because they were dumb enough to think that they can get away
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:38.280]  with a quarter point hike i knew that wouldn't be the case and now they've pricked their own bubble
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:42.520]  and the air is coming out of it and you know that's why you talk about gold the only reason
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:47.720]  gold was falling was because people believed in this myth now that we're you know looking beneath
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:53.800]  behind the curtain gold is off to its best annual start in the history of gold right gold is now at
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:41:01.240]  about 1200 and 30 an ounce a little bit more it was at 1050 the day after the fed raised rates
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:06.440]  and in fact just yesterday one of the biggest gold bearers this analyst over at abien ambrough
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:15.480]  she had a price target for gold in 2016 of 900 she just changed it yesterday from 900 to 1300
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:21.560]  now that's a pretty big about face for a major bank and the reason she said that she did this
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:27.160]  is her case for lower gold prices was based on the fed raising rates she now believes that the
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.680]  feds not going to raise rates at all in 2016 and so now she thinks gold sure what do you say to
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:37.480]  people like dent who's been you know really accurate on a lot of fronts saying look it's
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:41.880]  going to end up going down because it's not even really a commodity it's it's basically worthless
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:46.920]  i disagree with him on some of those fronts even though he's really smart because it is a commodity
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:52.760]  it is industrially used it's seen culturally also as a hedge against inflation or emergency
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:42:00.200]  big governments uh large populations china india mexico are buying it anything but worthless
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:05.080]  but forgetting about its role as a commodity and it has a unique role and it's been valued for its
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:10.040]  properties for thousands of years but think about the environment we're in not only do we have
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:15.560]  zero percent interest rates but we have negative interest rates and we have governments threatening
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:21.160]  to outlaw cash they want to do away with a hundred dollar bill or the 500 that's the next place i was
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:27.400]  going i mean this will this will be all we have as a true barter currency it'll force us back to a
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:32.040]  real currency that was my next question i've never seen a push by the european central bank and by
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:37.960]  larry summers and by the big five banks to get rid of cash to make us go all digital what is that
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:44.200]  really about mr schiff well it's all about control it's about a loss of financial privacy it's about
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:49.720]  a loss of freedom and it's about being able to debase the money see the problem with negative
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:54.600]  interest rates right now is well i'll just take my money out of the bank and put it in my mattress
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:59.240]  and i avoid the negative rate well if they make that impossible if it's a either you put it in the
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:04.360]  bank or you don't have it then it's stuck there and then you can lose money with negative rates
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:10.040]  and it's also about them being able to do bail ins or tax your money uh or or or or basically
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.440]  nationalize it which they've done in europe over and over again i mean the big kahuna of tyranny
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:19.400]  we've always known is getting rid of cash and boy they're still pushing it and what about the
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.880]  underground economy the underground economy is not going to go away if they take away cash
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:29.000]  they're just going to have to find an alternative to cash and what's the oldest alternative available
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.560]  gold that's right over i mean what are people going to use people are going to go back to real
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:39.000]  money traditional money this experiment and fiat money is blowing up all around us and it's
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:45.480]  ironic that probably just before the greatest bull market in the history of gold you have so much
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:51.400]  negativity in fact just about all the hedge funds at the end of last year were short gold i mean it
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:55.960]  was the it was the first time in history that hedge funds were next short gold look at what
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:02.200]  this geniuses did they were all short gold out below 1100 and look where it is now i mean everything
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.680]  they bought so how bad did that hurt the one thing they shorted went up well who knows i mean i mean
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:11.000]  hedge funds are probably going to blow up look at the banks they own these financials the banks have
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.880]  been cut in half a lot of these favorite high flying tech tech stocks have been demolished
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:20.600]  everything they were buying is plunging and the one thing they were shorting is what's going up
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:26.520]  gold is the number one i didn't think of that because as you know you talked about this a decade
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:32.760]  ago ron paul's talked about it uh so many folks have talked about the manipulation of the gold
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:37.800]  and silver markets it's now come out they've been doing that and so and look you look at
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:42.120]  goldman's tax goldman's tax is desperately trying to encourage everybody to short gold
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:46.360]  they've been coming out several times not only are they telling people to sell gold they're telling
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:51.000]  them to short it they're saying it's going to 1100 how long can they suppress it how long can they
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.840]  suppress it well look obviously not long this whole fantasy is evaporating it's falling apart
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:01.560]  before their eyes they're desperate to try to do something they want to talk the price down but you
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:06.600]  know the truth is out they raise interest rates now by a tiny little bit and what do we have
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:11.880]  the worst start in in history of the stock market of the down so well let me just add this i haven't
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:17.560]  sold one piece of gold or silver that i've bought in 25 years and my gut tells me stuff i bought at
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:23.160]  300 i kept it when i went to 2000 it goes down to a thousand i don't care this whole paper fraud is
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:30.040]  garbage the enemies of freedom lie about it constantly and so i know it's there as an emergency
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:34.360]  backup and it just comes to and my gut tells me i did the right thing but then i talked to people
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:38.200]  like like like dent to be fair he didn't say it was worthless he just he just said you know it's
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:44.360]  overvalued he's right on so many things uh then i just get that though he's wrong on that because
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:49.720]  he somehow believes that it's all going to fall apart the us is going to collapse and the dollar
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:54.680]  is somehow going to gain value in that environment that makes no sense that's like telling me that a
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:59.480]  corporation is about to go bankrupt but i should buy shares in the company because the stock price
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:04.280]  is going to go up well he says it's it's it's the best house in the bad neighborhood and so far
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:09.320]  that's been happening it's not the best house it's actually the worst house the only reason that people
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:14.360]  perceive it to be good is because it's been a self-fulfilling prophecy and people have believed
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:18.200]  off of this game but we well you know the guy that brought down made off the guy that brought down
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:23.720]  made off says there's three bigger scams right now that he's investigating yeah well you know but
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:29.320]  we pierce the illusion we pretended that we can raise interest rates i said many times on your show
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.560]  the fed needed to talk about raising interest rates to pretend that they could do it but not
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:38.200]  actually do it improve it they couldn't well we just raised interest rates a quarter point
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:43.160]  and all hell is breaking loose if you look at the banking sector it hasn't been this stress since
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:48.120]  that before that's my next question you're getting into all the technicals you did call it just exactly
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:53.240]  the whole time with qe and what would happen tell us next and i'm not disagreeing with you but somebody
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.040]  like dent says the us is great china is bad china is going to hell in a hand basket you a lot of
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:02.920]  times say china is better than the us china set the ban all foreign media from publishing online
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:08.600]  that's the independent china obviously has seen a third of its wealth go away what do you see really
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:13.000]  going where are the best places to be where are the worst places and what's the next shoe to drop
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:17.640]  yeah look well what does china produce they produce all sorts of products that everybody in
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:22.680]  the world wants to consume we have a huge trade deficit with china it's not the other way around
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:27.800]  all we produce is treasury bonds we go into debt we borrow money to buy the things that the chinese
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:33.240]  economy is productive enough to create so we're the country that's in a lot more trouble not china
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:37.000]  they're the ones that have been loaning us money they're the ones who have been you know allowing
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:42.040]  us to have all the stuff that they produce so i i think that people who are worried about china
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:47.400]  are missing the bigger picture china has problems but our problems are much larger he thought china
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:51.320]  would be the detonator but isn't the argument really the detonator uh and i think he says this
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:57.880]  too and you say this is is the the qe unlimited oh yeah and you know a lot of these hedge funds that
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:02.920]  were shorting gold or different hedge funds now are shorting the chinese currency the the yuan
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:06.680]  because they think it's going to collapse but it's actually the dollar that's going to collapse not
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:12.040]  the yuan could go because as it's been the idea that we can raise interest rates that is supported
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:17.080]  the dollar sure this is the biggest bubble the federal reserve has ever inflated the u.s economy
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:21.880]  is in worse shape than it's ever been we double the national debt since the financial you're not
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:26.360]  being negative these are facts so let me ask you this just as a father you know as a father talking
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:32.680]  to a father okay what do you really think is going to happen i know you're not a prediction but
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:37.480]  obviously we have another great depression people are going to kill each other i mean we're not as
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:42.120]  morals we were people were hardworking they knew how to plant a garden they and still seven million
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:47.080]  people major university studies show died in association of malnutrition or from illnesses
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:51.400]  from malnutrition basically seven million people died in the famine in the u.s over that 10 years
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:56.200]  uh it was it was you know quietly dealt with it was very very sad europe tens of millions
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:00.840]  what is going to happen if we have a real real depression here with this spoiled rotten population
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:05.720]  i mean i am actually scared well this could be a lot worse because during the depression
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:10.280]  in america we were still a relatively free prosperous economy we had lots of individual
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:15.320]  rights government was tiny we had sound money we were on the gold standard uh and we had the
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:20.680]  benefit of falling prices everybody wants to talk about how bad deflation is look deflation is great
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:25.640]  you're unemployed and the cost of food is going down and your rent is going down and your utility
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:30.200]  bills are going down that's all good news right americans aren't going to be that fortunate this
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:35.080]  time because we're going to see massive increases in consumer price hell on earth i mean look the
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:39.320]  pentagon says it the ministry of defense and the reports that we've covered say it that when there's
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:44.200]  a financial meltdown they say between 2016 and 2020 this was put out in 2007 london guardian
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:49.480]  go look it up folks they say it could be road warrior level is one of the quotes in the pentagon
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.440]  report i mean i don't know if it's going to get that bad but the societal issue of all these spoiled
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:59.480]  rotten brats that think everything is entitled to them under socialism and a crazy like bernie
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:04.360]  sanders i mean is this not the perfect storm sir what do you think oh yeah this is this is the
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:09.720]  reason that the founding fathers uh detested democracy to so much they wanted to protect us
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.480]  from things like bernie sanders but look i don't know how bad it's going to get
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:19.240]  but i don't want to find out you know holding dollars i don't want to have my my life savings my
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:24.120]  retirement accounts in a currency uh that can be almost completely worthless in a worst case
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:27.880]  scenario even in the best case scenario the dollar is going to lose the majority of its
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:32.200]  purchasing power there's no way out of this peter stay there come back with one more segment and
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:36.760]  in one more weekend you probably got to go but i want to really drill into this best case scenario
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.720]  worst case scenario and what you're doing i mean seriously folks i'm not exaggerating when i say
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:46.360]  i'm thinking about getting a farmhouse with an arm or a 20 foot wall you know and i mean seriously
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:50.600]  i mean this is just out of control if you study this and what the real experts say
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:53.480]  versus the media this is dangerous we'll be back

[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:16.120]  those folks aren't calling peter shift myself ron paul fair mongers anymore i mean you can't just
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:22.280]  print unlimited money and give it to the elites forever and not have it cause big problems so
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:25.640]  and then the six minutes we have the next five minutes of mr. shifts whether someone try to
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:31.640]  shut up here uh and let him break down where he thinks this is going how bad it's going to get
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:35.720]  what he's doing to protect himself and what some of the other big hot spots are and then the next
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:40.200]  segment i want to briefly ask him about the campaigns about the pope weighing in on politics
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:45.720]  where he sees all that going as well but i'm getting back to the head of europe specific capital
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:51.080]  and also give folks that website and put that up on screen peter continue where we left off
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:56.840]  you know it's amazing how often history repeats you know even recent history because
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:03.160]  the last financial crisis happened in the final year of bush's second term and the same thing
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:07.960]  is about to happen again it's the final year of obama's second term and the bubble that the
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:13.560]  central banks have created during the obama administration is much bigger than the one
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:19.720]  that we inflated during the bush administration and if you remember in early 2008 in february 2008
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:24.600]  all the experts were unanimous everything was great the us economy was in good shape
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.760]  nothing to worry about and then a few months later we had the financial crisis and you know all
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:34.520]  hell broke loose and now the same thing is happening again because we didn't let the free market
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:40.040]  solve the problems that the federal reserve created we now have exacerbated all those problems
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:43.960]  we now have an even bigger economic crisis around the corner and the same experts who
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:48.360]  were oblivious before are still telling us that everything is fine there's nothing to worry about
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:52.760]  in fact the fed was so convinced we were in such great shape that they actually raised interest
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:57.400]  rates in december and everybody applauded everybody said well this is fantastic this proves that
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:02.280]  that the crisis is over well we're about to launch this crisis into a whole new year what you saw
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:07.320]  in 2008 was a sunday school picnic compared to what's coming up right now and i think what we're
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:11.880]  going to have this time again is a currency crisis because i don't think they're going to let it get
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:16.920]  to a repeat of 2008 in this election year i think they're getting ready to pull out the stops with
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:22.040]  zero percent maybe negative rates qe4 who knows what these guys are going to do but it's going to
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:27.400]  destroy the value of the dollar hopefully hopefully it won't be a worst case scenario which is hyper
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:32.280]  inflation where the currency is completely worthless hopefully they figure out their mistakes
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:37.560]  before we go that far down the line but don't wait you know don't wait to find out how much
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:41.000]  value the dollar loses you need to get rid of your dollars now that's what we're doing with our
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.640]  clients we're still buying lots of gold gold stocks are extremely cheap and people really want to
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:50.280]  try to hit the home run here you know there's a lot of 10 baggers 20 baggers in the gold mining
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:56.680]  space even though a lot of these stocks are up 50 100 150 percent since mid january since mid january
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:01.080]  you've got some stocks that have tripled but there's still so much more to go a lot of these stocks
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:06.120]  are still down 70 80 percent from where they were a few years ago but i think the momentum is there
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:12.840]  in these stocks also in physical gold and the markets i like the best new zealand a singapore
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:17.880]  switzerland there's a lot of value there because the dollar is still overpriced because people
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:22.280]  haven't figured out what's around the corner yet so there's still plenty of time for people to
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:27.000]  protect themselves and you know work with me at europe's civic capital to get these diversified
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:33.160]  foreign portfolios or work with me at shift gold to get physical gold uh you know before it blows
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:37.160]  through 1300 because once it goes through there you know there's not that much resistance until
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.920]  we get back near the old highs of around 1900 well peter expanding on that when i have dinner on he
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:46.600]  says hey all the gold in the world goes in an olympic swimming pool that's not what you're
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:50.200]  going to base the currency on well that sounds like it's what you do base it on because it's
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:57.480]  exactly plus plus it's industrial plus once the market's been so bad for four years or whatever
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:02.520]  everybody's getting out of gold at the production level that means then you can't ramp production
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:08.840]  back up for a long time once gold goes back up to me it seems like the biggest potential home run
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:14.360]  there is a grand slam but absolutely you better get your piece of that swimming pool while you can
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:19.480]  because the fact that it's scarce is one of the reasons it's so valuable and yes can we base the
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:27.720]  world's monetary system on gold at $1230 an ounce no we can't but at $10,000 an ounce at $20,000
[01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:32.600]  an ounce obviously there's a price that's going to that's right stay there and davos talks about

[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:22.680]  he's not a sponsor but i do have a moment because he knows what he's talking about what comes to
[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:28.200]  economics and things and so that's why i do endorse a lot of peter schiff's ideas
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:35.400]  but i'm just here to get people thinking for themselves and having a wide variety of different
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:41.960]  perspectives so you can make your own decisions i just know that i've studied history and never
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:48.520]  before have humans been more unself-sufficient more dependent more spoiled rotten in the west
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:52.280]  they're great people in europe great people in america great people in japan great people in
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:58.360]  australia new zealand canada but let's just get down to brass tacks i don't know how to take care
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:04.040]  of myself compared to my dad and i'm like a caveman compared to the average yuppie i mean you hear
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:07.240]  about yuppies move out in the country and they see their neighbor hauling a deer up to gut it
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:12.440]  they call the police on them i see that article every day in the news and the cops show up act
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:18.040]  like it's wrong in many areas you know and it's just like it's body snatchers or something what are
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:22.440]  they going to do during this meltdown and how bad is it going to get we've only about four minutes
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:27.480]  left i wanted to just get any more time frame info from you peter and then also ask what do you
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:31.960]  think about the campaign so far what do you think about scalia i didn't say they murdered him i said
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:36.360]  there should be an autopsy the cops have come out and said that too one of the deputies came on and
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:41.640]  said they've never done this before it's really weird um other little tidbits about what's happening
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:46.120]  bernie sanders what a nightmare well obviously look there should be an autopsy but you know
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:51.000]  79 year old guy overweight probably not in the best shape i mean the fact that he died of
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.720]  natural causes is you know obviously uh not something that's outside the realm of possibility
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:00.840]  but look they should still do an autopsy anyway uh just uh just to clear away any potential doubts
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:05.880]  but you know bernie sanders that is very scary i mean if you you look at the support that he
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:11.160]  enjoys uh particularly with younger people in this country and that is a very scary thought
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:16.920]  because unfortunately this is a democracy which means mobocracy which means majority rules and
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:21.720]  that the majority are a bunch of socialists we're in trouble look the nazi party again not that i'm
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:25.400]  going to compare but they were national socialists and Hitler was going to give them something for
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:31.160]  free what about sanders it turns out never had a paying job till 40 and bragged that he was a bum
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:37.000]  the guy is a bum yeah my point is but but we elected germany elected the nazis but the point is
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:42.360]  this is the danger of putting up things up to a vote when you have american school system we
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:47.560]  indoctrinate kids they learn absolutely nothing they're brainwashed until they're 22 years old
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:52.520]  and they come out bernie sanders voters they know nothing about economics they know nothing about
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:56.280]  the history of this country they know nothing about our founding principles of what made this
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:03:00.920]  country great they're just a bunch of nonsense and they want something for nothing and they believe
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:06.600]  the lies told by sanders because the lies told by the democrats and republicans up until now have
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:11.240]  blown up in their faces and especially when you have brock obama given a state of the union address
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:14.760]  talk about how great everything is and how many jobs he's created and you've got all these people
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:21.080]  living in the u.s has never been better financially no and people are frustrated because at least bill
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:26.280]  clinton said i feel your pain brock obama is like hey there's no pain to feel i've done a great job
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:31.080]  and this is just you know creating a great environment for bernie sanders to tap into that
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:36.920]  resentment that frustration and of course the nvm wins in a matchup i mean because now even
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:41.400]  salons thrown in the towel saying hillary can't win who's more dangerous bernie or hillary a and
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:47.080]  then b uh i think trump will dominate either one of those clowns in the general election you know
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:53.800]  trump is an unknown quantity because you know trump is a showman right and he may be saying certain
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:59.400]  things because he knows that that's what's going to get the votes i mean trump i probably trump
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:04.520]  has better judgment and is you know and probably more intelligent to actually do the right thing
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:08.040]  a lot of the things that he's saying to get elected hopefully those aren't going to be the
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:13.640]  things that he does if he is elected he might just be you know as much as he says i'm not a politician
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:19.880]  he's playing politics because he knows what works and by holding himself up out not to be a politician
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.280]  right to say i'm not the same old thing i'm something different this there's a lot of politics
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:28.440]  there because he's sure i'm not usually lesser two evils but we know he's better than hillary and
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:33.640]  bernie well no question about it but the question is what will he do i mean if he obviously tries
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:38.280]  to put all these tariffs on and he doesn't really want to cut social security he wants to replace
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:42.600]  obama here with some other kind of government socialized program if he wants to do a lot of this
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:46.360]  stuff then it's going to be a disaster but hopefully he's smart enough not to actually
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:51.240]  do that once he gets elected he can do what's right all right peter schiff we're out of time
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:56.120]  thank you so much peter we'll be right back i'm alex shown stay with us we're going to be talking to
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:02.200]  dr group you talk about leveling with the american people have you always told the truth i've always
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:08.360]  tried to i'm george washington and i try not to tell lies leon macadam with info wars dot com
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:13.640]  let me level with you america here's just a small sampling of hillary's whoppers there's the ben gazi
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:19.080]  hearing using a secret private server to hide her activities lying about not sharing classified
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:23.800]  information on that secret server using the clinton foundation as a cover for tax evasion
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:27.960]  and taking bribes from foreign countries she claims to be against the big banks but won't
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:33.560]  release transcripts of the speeches she made to those banks who paid her hefty speaking fees white
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:39.480]  water watergate defending a rapist threatening all of bill's bimbos in an effort to keep them quiet
[02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:44.680]  then claiming to run a campaign for women clinton even took a hundred and ninety thousand dollars
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:49.640]  worth of household goods from the white house when bill left office i guess they were dead
[02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:55.080]  broke at the time what difference at this point does it make read more at info wars dot com
[02:05:55.080 --> 02:06:06.040]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war

[02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:18.840]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid

[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:50.200]  from the front lines of the information war i'm your host alex jones
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:55.160]  see i could set up here into the whole show in a perfect radio voice but i don't i get up here and
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:59.800]  it's obnoxious sometimes i listened to about two hours of the broadcast yesterday last night on the
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:05.560]  free iphone app while i was doing research late in the evening and a lot of it was good info the
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:14.840]  guests were great the facts were very eliminating but i could hear myself getting overwrought getting
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:20.760]  wound up trying to cover too much getting sped up in the third hour and so today i'm going to try to
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:31.160]  just sit back and relax and just cover everything now i have moved uh bigs daniels madson night
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:36.600]  and everybody to the fourth hour so they can just host it today instead of just coming in here and
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:40.840]  being guests for 30 minutes they're just going to host a round table about scalia about political
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:47.480]  assassinations about uh we've got a michael savage interview with uh the bigs got uh that he's
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:52.360]  going to air some of so michael savage in the next hour just a bunch of other stuff in the fourth hour
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:59.000]  so that way i can relax right now take my time cover some of the news that i haven't gotten to
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:04.200]  yet talk to dr group for about 20 minutes on some big breaking news and then segue into all these
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:11.080]  clips and other news i haven't covered that have me hyperventilating the tpp text is out it does end
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:17.320]  copyright as we know it if you say mickey mouse they will shut down your website they're actually
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:22.440]  going to say internationally in a secret treaty we've signed that they can copyright words and
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:29.880]  then you can't use them even in your own text hyperlinks will be uh illegal but they just come
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:35.240]  in through the multinational internet system and that's why they've transferred i can and all that
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:40.920]  to the un now it's all being done to for massive censorship and they're modeling and after china
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:46.280]  china set to ban all foreign media from publishing online devastating info and again matt dredge was
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:52.200]  here four or five months ago whatever it was in this studio he's done like one other interview in four
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:14:01.160]  or five years i mean the media just couldn't believe it and he came here because he knew that
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:05.240]  even though he's a serious person broken thousands of international stories broken some of the biggest
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:09.800]  stories ever that they'd make a joke out of that if he came and said i had dinner with a supreme
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:13.400]  court justice and they warned everybody's coming after the free press next year this is now next
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:17.160]  year even though he's known to be friends with these people he just knew he could actually come
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:20.360]  here and actually talk for 45 minutes and then we wouldn't censor him
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:27.000]  and of course he could do it on his own platform as well but he was showing solidarity
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:31.240]  to support this broadcast because he understands they're coming after all of us
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:37.480]  when they're always trying to put limbaugh in jail because his back was hurt and he was on some
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:43.480]  pain pills whoop de-do the government ships the narcotics in or they try to constantly find stuff
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:52.760]  to put me in jail for all those go we better shut up then go along with us no and it's not that limbaugh
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:59.080]  is even perfect nobody is it's the point if they can take him down they can take everybody down
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:03.320]  and mark levin says a lot of stuff i agree with he's a he's a talented talk show host
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:10.040]  but to call donald trump a wacko nut because he said there's 28 pages that show saudi rabie
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:14.040]  carried out the attacks and the bushes are no heroes it says in there and i've interviewed
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:20.040]  walter jones of north carolina i've interviewed ran paul of kentucky who's seen it and i've
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:25.160]  interviewed a former senator who saw it was on the commission and six of the 10 say there's a
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:33.320]  cover up including republicans the 28 pages say a stand down was ordered that's high treason
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:39.480]  it was an inside job not saying there isn't radical islam no no just like they bring in the
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:44.040]  radicals lomest then they attack us then they take our freedom europe is under civil emergency
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:48.680]  martial law in france and germany they're arresting people prominent people that mildly
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:55.480]  criticize open borders there is a false flag to the radical islam they're bringing it in
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:07.800]  sick and that's why i'm backing trump because my gut tells me go where they my gut tells
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:12.040]  this is not a setup when he starts doing stuff like that or starts telling the pope hey you
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:19.560]  got 200 foot walls and quoting me exactly again you know trump is aware and involved and and trump
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:23.080]  does read our material and does listen to the show and i don't sit there and brag about that it's
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:26.440]  just a fact i mean he's obviously been on the show he and he knew what happened when he did that
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:29.560]  now dr grip will be with us for the rest of the hour i'm going to him right after the break
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:35.800]  he is he is he just has such incredible research he's constantly contacting us and pointing out
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:41.720]  hey have you covered this fda to start testing for clifus state in the food why this is so big
[02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:46.760]  we'll talk about how many tons of this has been dumped on the soil and it's in every known water
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:53.160]  supply in the us and it is miracle growth for cancer and mammals fda to start testing we're
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:58.120]  going to look at that we're going to look at toxins found in seafood worldwide dangerous toxins
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:02.200]  and cabin air passed on to cruise study finds and why are we covering this there's ways to
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:07.640]  mitigate block and detoxify our anti-material soap safe even the wall street journal says
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:13.320]  what group reported on 20 years ago it sterilizes you it's part of the sperm not having tails or
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:21.720]  shrunken tails prevalence of fetal exposure to environmental toxins is determined by analysis
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:27.400]  we're going to get to all of this body burden the pollution in newborns now it's passed on
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:32.200]  the toxicity in your body i mean this is hardcore stuff but there's things you can do
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:36.200]  a lot of people say i'm just going to smoke cigarettes drink alcohol and eat gmail i don't
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:41.800]  care if i die what about how you pass that on what about what happens with your wife as a kid
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:49.000]  we're dying as a species the earth is dying there are real environmental crises and the environment
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:54.280]  and the environmental movement is globalist eugenicist transhumanist run they want to destroy
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:57.880]  the earth and rewrite it they say the earth's done they're going to build a new one they're
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:02.840]  they want to live forever they're on power trips and so they control the movement by making it about
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:11.400]  carbon that's life giving it's so ingenious and sick we are the environmentalist we are the true
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:18.840]  folks that are promoting sustainability the globals are all about not having sustainability
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:24.360]  they got a lot of window dressing that sounds good but the heart of it is evil and yes there'll

[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:07.640]  they're social justice warriors and this is the cia black op op mena arkansas all the murders
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:13.320]  been gauzy the corruption the the stolen valor the brian williams of female politicians but it's
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:20.440]  all about women well guess what salon the folks that endorse pedophilia in five articles in
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:25.480]  the last few years literally you know that say it's it's just a you know a right i guess or something

[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:41.480]  think of this election what do you think of what's happening what do you think of wow hillary a
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:47.320]  referendum on the establishment shinking in her own party that is amazing and what do you think of
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:53.800]  trump i i've been watching your your show a lot and listening to a lot of other people out there
[02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:58.280]  and i mean i think we're right in the middle of a revolution you know there's a lot of things good
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:02.680]  that are happening there's a lot of things bad that are happening but ultimately it's people
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:08.600]  like us and the info warriors out there that are fighting for things every single day to
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:13.960]  eliminate the toxins in the air the food in the water and i think we're on the verge of a change i
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:20.680]  personally like trump myself i it's it's just i can't even believe some of the words that comes
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:25.800]  out of the democratic's mouths i mean we have an economy that's crashing we have a health care
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:32.040]  system that is horrible doctors are quitting their jobs we have a whole world that is sick
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:37.960]  the whole water supply in the world is contaminated the air supply is contaminated so
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:42.600]  i mean it can't get that much worse i mean on the on the good side of things we do have
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:48.200]  solutions for a lot of those uh i was about to say two years ago the fda comes out says
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:51.400]  fluoride does give you cancer we should take it out of the water still hadn't happened but they're
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:55.560]  starting to do it uh we told people glad to say it was growing tumors it was well known now they're
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:27:00.440]  talking about removing it and banning it uh there's so many good things happening i think we may be
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:06.120]  hitting bottom yeah i was telling my employees the other day when we had a company meeting i said
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:12.280]  you guys don't really understand what you're part of here i mean we are part of a revolution
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:17.960]  in 15 years 20 years when they write the history books and they look back and they say
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:26.440]  these were the problems years ago up until 2014 2015 2016 the water was poisonous the food was
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:31.480]  poisonous and our kids say how did that happen dad how did all that happen just like how did we
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:35.880]  inject black people with syphilis or how do we radiate foster children you know they're gonna
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:40.680]  look back and say how did that happen yeah but we're all heroes i mean we haven't realized it yet
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:44.840]  but you're a hero we're a hero the info warriors all the people that are coming forward that are
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:50.280]  forcing the epa the fda to change the majority of the government scientists are our biggest
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:54.840]  allies saying we're absolutely right we have the militaries totally awake exposing the the
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:28:01.000]  all kind of connection right so even though we're going through an attack right now in the future
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:07.880]  will be looked upon as the revolutionaries that actually changed the world and brought in a new
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:15.640]  peaceful government a non corrupt government and healthy living technologies i mean you can almost
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:19.960]  see oil and gas falling down and free energy coming in i mean this should have happened years
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:25.720]  ago you can see the pharmaceutical industry that is threatened right now by the natural health
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:31.560]  industry so you can see these big industries that are running scared right now and that are fearful
[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:37.320]  and it's all has to do with public activists said three years ago mcdonalds will go bankrupt by 2020
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:42.520]  it looks like it may be earlier than that they now admit they're facing collapse uh i mean it is just
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:45.640]  a beautiful thing again we don't want to see a quote american company collapse it's not it's a
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:52.040]  globalist monsanto bill gatesfront of franken food to test us and lower our standards and break our
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:57.480]  will and demoralize us as an enemy operation literally and and and the fact that it's in
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:02.440]  trouble coca-cola is in trouble all these globalist operations the the two big parties
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:06.840]  their establishments in trouble and i want to clarify when i say we fit bottom i mean culturally
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:11.000]  things are going to get a lot worse now but culturally we've hit rock bottom we're bounding
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:15.560]  back up right now but we're going to go through the physical problems and tribulations now
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:22.440]  yeah you're right and uh one of the things that is important is that everybody continues to do
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:27.320]  what they're doing you know writing letters to their senators legislators i think this new group
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:33.000]  this of children that are being raised that are coming up right now are more aware uh you know our
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:37.720]  our generation well more and more people are becoming aware every single day all over the world
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:41.160]  stay there i want to come back i totally agree people are either being born and put in front of
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:45.960]  tv's and being totally destroyed but there's the biggest crop ever of super people basically
[02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:50.120]  i mean just folks that are we're on the march are going to respond genetically and spiritually to
[02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:55.080]  the attack get ready for the real rise of the resistance we're only the first phase folks
[02:29:55.080 --> 02:30:04.200]  a tech exec is outraged at having to see homeless riffraff and he warns of a revolution
[02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:08.840]  in an open letter to san francisco's mayor tech entrepreneur justin keller asks what
[02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:13.720]  are you going to do to address this problem he describes some of his unfortunate encounters
[02:30:13.720 --> 02:30:18.920]  with the homeless riffraff on the streets who disturb his ability to enjoy the trendy upscale
[02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:24.200]  san francisco neighborhoods he bemoans the fact that wealthy workers have to witness the pain
[02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:30.040]  struggle and despair of the homeless people on their daily commute uh he then warns there's
[02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:35.320]  going to be a revolution indeed darlings like keller enriched by the latest speculative tech
[02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:40.520]  bubble are completely oblivious to the coming financial tsunami bubble economics is responsible
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:45.800]  for the success keller enjoys but as the economy falters that source of financing will inevitably

[02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:27.320]  believe it when i see this stuff so before we get to health news i want to talk to you about this
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.560]  because you're not just you know an incredible supplement formulator and doesn't just have
[02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:37.880]  like six or seven different you know degrees and alternative medicine and and research and
[02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:42.120]  herbology and the rest of it y'all he was you know in the army in a special task force and he's a
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:46.600]  smart guy i mean i really respect him we're friends he comes to town we go to dinner uh you know he
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:54.520]  and i and his wife and friends but we don't hate the muslims we're not here to have a clash of
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:34:03.320]  civilizations the globalists want that but i see every day in the u.s in europe in canada with
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:10.680]  straight faces classes where you convert to islam classes with the girls wear hajibs hajibs
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:18.760]  and where they push this culture and the weird left actually supports it and defends it but hates
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:22.680]  christian western values that truly liberalized women's rights
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:30.440]  you know they claim they're trying to illuminate the world you know the illuminati the all seeing
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:34.600]  eye we go back to the old testament god's described you know as an all-seeing eye they've
[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:40.600]  just expropriated that symbol and they've expropriated the fact that they're the people for free
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:45.080]  will or freedom everything they run they bring total tyranny and and the republicans are just
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:50.280]  a fake brand of them claiming to be quote conservative what does that mean put this new
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:54.680]  article up on info wars dot com homework assignment tell your parents you're converting to islam
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:59.880]  it's all just a screw with everybody this is the island of guernsey off england
[02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:09.400]  miss amber stables the school's religious education teacher
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:17.160]  and again this is all social justice warrior stuff to empathize with the people being brought over
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:21.800]  i mean they brought in these folks from canada's imam said we're preparing to you know help jihad
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:26.680]  help the muja hadin attack we must support their attacks you can come into canada saying you're
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:32.440]  gonna you know support jihad that's okay but if you're myself they hardly let me in or stop me or
[02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:40.200]  even david ike so i wanted to ask dr ebra group what he thinks about this i mean obviously they're
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:45.480]  trying to get civil wars going and then use the crisis they bring in to take liberties like europe's
[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:50.920]  done but is the public that dumb to not see what's happening but what does it tell us about our
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:58.040]  rulers they would bring the most incompatible most unliberal freak show radicals in here that
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:02.680]  mutilate their women that in freedom of slaves and man have you talked about about this the left
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:08.600]  attacks me so hard and says i'm quote racist because i don't support radical hobbyism and
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:17.240]  keeping women as pet slaves i mean i mean what is going on here well i think it's a combination
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:23.160]  of multiple things you have it's the spoken hub model of destruction really you have chemicals
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:31.880]  you have fear mongering you have negativity you have religious war you have all contamination of
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:37.480]  the food supply you have oil and gas you have financial structures that you can manipulate
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:44.280]  so when you put all of those things together it just falls into the control and the general plan
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:51.880]  of where they want to go with reducing the population creating war creating sickness creating
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:57.080]  the fact that they can control everybody by poisoning you or now even using genetically
[02:36:57.080 --> 02:37:03.400]  modified insects and viruses and everything else different types of implant systems so they can
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:11.160]  track you everywhere you go i mean it's just one more thing in the big wheel of change that
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:16.520]  they're trying the globalists are trying to portray on us i mean and especially with you know
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:25.000]  the jihad look god doesn't want us to kill each other and any religion in my view that promotes
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.880]  killing another human being there's got to be something wrong with it i mean i you know i i
[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:37.320]  come from the training that christian philosophy of love everybody as your brother you know treat
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:44.040]  thy neighbor as thyself you know don't kill don't do any of these different types of activities
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:48.520]  and let's be clear do not commit murder it's it's perfectly christian to defend yourself
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:53.000]  or an army's attacking you'll be in your army and fight back but don't say because somebody is such
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:58.360]  and such it's okay to go out and kill them and that's what their interpretations of islam is
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:03.400]  and that islam is taking over islam i mean the debate's almost over and our government is backing
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:10.840]  radicalism well yeah i think that's been going on for quite some time now and uh it's a war against
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:18.600]  christians and they know a religious war they can create fear and create anger within people and if
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:23.880]  they do that their immune systems are gonna go down they're gonna stay sick and you know they're
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:29.320]  kind of out of it in a way except for the fact that the bankers and the you know big corporations
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:35.080]  that are producing all the military equipment are making lots of money so it's a psych warfare
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:40.040]  program to break our will and to moralize this and you know it doesn't have that effect on me it makes
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:43.480]  me want to fight back and resist and folks need to get out of the thing i'm like oh it's overwhelming
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:48.840]  oh it's horrible and not being fear saying i'm gonna do something about it get in power and realize
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:54.760]  that literally we're turning into a new paradigm and that's what makes them so scared dr group
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:39:00.840]  that is i mean people are starting to you know we we see it change we see the change that's
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:05.800]  happening for example a few years back there was a study done where they took babies the journal of
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:12.600]  neurotoxology and they tested the first bowel movement of babies and they have 426 infants
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:20.760]  and they found 84 percent contained mercury 27 percent contained lead and 27 percent had dbt
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:27.400]  and their bowel movements that's crazy that's and then they inject the baby with 36 vaccinations
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:32.200]  which contain even more mercury so getting to the reason why i'm saying that is because
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:36.680]  that's how important it is this is what's happening to the children that are being born in and they're
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:42.200]  also finding it in the studies you sent me in there uh the blood from the umbilical cord i mean
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:48.600]  they're being hammered well they found 76 chemicals linked to cancer they found 94 chemicals that are
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:54.200]  toxic to the brain and nervous system 86 chemicals that interfere with the hormone system which we
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:40:00.920]  talk about a lot 79 chemicals associated with birth defects 77 chemicals toxic to the reproductive
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:08.280]  system and 77 chemicals toxic to the immune system was 167 different chemicals they found with an
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:18.520]  average of 91 industrial toxins in each person they tested now that leads me even to the state
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:24.760]  that yes there was just a wall street journal article that came out about the fda testing for
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:31.320]  glyphosate finally and the reason why they're doing it was because all of the activist groups all the
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:36.600]  information that we've been putting out on the internet finally is forcing the big government
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:43.400]  not i don't know if they're going to do anything about it but it's finally gaining mainstream news
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:53.720]  so we know how damaging glyphosate is so that's that's a great step forward in ultimately getting
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:59.400]  that taken out all together seemed like it was impossible 10 years ago 20 years ago to expose
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:04.120]  globus so they said oh you can drink it it's good for you that the famous lobbyist that says that
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:08.920]  they go here's some on tv you think i'm crazy and then now they're admitting it's causing cancer they
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:13.000]  admit it grows tumors they've known that forever but now they're in trouble this is part of a
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:19.560]  population control agenda obviously what do you expect to happen to monsanto where do you see all
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:29.160]  this going well i would be extremely happy if monsanto either went bankrupt and no longer existed
[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:35.080]  for the damage or they had to fork out billions and trillions and trillions of dollars for cleanup
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:40.680]  projects to clean up all the damage they've done to the environment and pay everybody off for the
[02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:46.360]  infertility and the sterility that they've caused and the toxic endocrine disrupting problems
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:54.280]  for the animals and the humans but ultimately i see that the way that we're going it all goes
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:59.240]  back to consumer demand you talked about mcdonald's and now mcdonald's is planning on introducing some
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:04.840]  certified organic things so the more the public steps forward and says we're not going to use
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:10.440]  your chemical we have the power of choice they try to convince us we don't we do that's right
[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:15.000]  that's right and just like the antibacterial soaps i mean we've been talking about the
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:20.920]  damaging effects of cosmetics the trickle of sand in there the yeah let's talk about that new wall
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:26.840]  street journal article our antibacterial sub safe we've known for decades that that it's linked
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:33.480]  to infertility correct yeah it is i mean how many times do people use hand sanitizers they use soaps
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:39.160]  they use toxic shampoos toxic conditioners toxic lotions they all pretty much fall in the same
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:44.520]  category because they have the same toxic compounds in them they have fragrances which are carcinogenic
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:50.520]  phthalates they have trickle sand they have a propylene glycol they have a lot of different
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:56.200]  damaging chemicals of course the epa and the falsified research in the past has said that
[02:42:56.200 --> 02:43:02.040]  they're safe to use but now we know that they're not and that's another kind of a short victory
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:09.000]  for us because now the fda has required that by september of this year all of these companies
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:14.680]  are going to have to prove and demonstrate that their products are safe and more effective than
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:20.760]  just plain soap and water now that's what i grew up on is just plain soap and plain water and of
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:25.080]  course you know there's huge markets out there for these hand sanitizers and everything else that
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:30.680]  they have to include all these toxic chemicals in so this could affect millions of americans and
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:38.280]  we're already seeing some of these major corporations that produce all these different types of soaps
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:45.640]  and cleaning products and everything else they see the demand out there for certified organic
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:51.160]  100 all natural products so they they have research projects going on right now so that's
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:56.120]  we are we are winning the war i tell people look they say why don't you get into politics well why
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:44:00.440]  don't you try to run for office then you can create change you don't create change when you're in
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:05.480]  office they tell you what to do this is how we create change by getting this information out
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:13.000]  to the masses we can do more in one year than someone can sitting in office for eight years or 16
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:17.480]  years that's why they want to ban farmers markets and the war on lemonade stands even forms reported
[02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:23.800]  on because normal human activity us not being domesticated is the enemy now i i want to get
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:29.880]  into a plug here because we literally sell out a liver shield for a month two months three months
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:33.560]  because it's so hard to get the ingredients it would be our best-selling product if we could
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:38.760]  keep it in stock but it is hard to source it right explain why that is and then let's get into the
[02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:44.680]  cleanse and and and why this is so popular in fourslife.com you can go there you get it with
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:49.240]  the oxy powder then get the apple cider vinegar at the store and then do the one week cleanse or
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:52.760]  just do the general liver shield put it in your water under your tongue has a lot of benefits
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:57.000]  explain why liver shield has been given people such dramatic results compared to other liver
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:03.720]  cleansers well number one is we've spent 20 years working in refining and we continually look for
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:10.200]  herbs and methods and ways and technology to improve the effectiveness or the absorption
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:15.400]  or the quality of the herbs and now we're going into biodynamic growing systems we're the only
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:21.800]  there's only two organic herb farms in the whole united states that are biodynamic certified and
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:29.000]  biodynamic is above and beyond so we constantly you know our motto is candy constant and never
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:34.360]  ending improvement we always want to keep producing the highest quality stuff available
[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:39.000]  and choose the herbs we are running into a problem right now where many herbs are becoming
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  extinct and that's why you'll see us change the formula sometimes and add additional herbs
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:50.680]  but the whole focus is the liver is your main detoxification organ and that's why I feel it's
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:55.320]  so important you have two organs the intestinal tract and the liver if your intestinal tract is
[02:45:55.320 --> 02:46:02.280]  healthy digestive health with a good probiotic and and clean and you're going to bat to the
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:09.000]  bathroom on a regular basis then the liver is the main filtration system in the body it detoxifies
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:13.480]  the blood it's a phase one and a phase two detoxification system and we talked about how
[02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:19.400]  many chemicals they found in the blood system and in the fecal matter of infants that's a sign
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:24.680]  right there and those are just two studies there's multiple studies out there that have tested for
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:30.440]  major chemicals heavy metals all different types of toxins and when we have too many of those
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:36.360]  it stresses the liver and causes the liver to become sluggish fatty we're seeing non-alcoholic
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:43.400]  fatty liver disease in children 12 years old and the liver uses bile as its main vehicle
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:48.920]  to get the toxins out of the body and the bile dumps into the small intestine so if your liver
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:54.600]  is dependent on your intestinal tract moving and it's not and it's constipated guess what those
[02:46:54.600 --> 02:47:00.840]  toxins end up soaking back into the bloodstream and you reabsorb them and the liver doesn't have
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:05.240]  anywhere to put them so get those toxins get stored in your fat tissue they get stored in your
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:11.400]  cardiovascular system that's why your liver swells up gets fatty and then bye bye right exactly so
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:14.920]  it doesn't matter your weak link is where those toxins are going to be stored and that's the whole
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:19.080]  disease process right there well look folks who support the broadcast getting liver shield and
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:24.200]  oxy powder at infowarslife.com or by calling triple eight two five three three one three nine
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:29.880]  do the cleanse go read the right reviews and if it doesn't work for you which is about one
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:34.040]  percent of people dr. group says and that's my experience that it must be you're either incredibly
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:40.120]  cleaned out or you better go see a doctor right away in fact briefly dr. group going back to this
[02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:43.720]  discussion some people it takes two days three days after for the flush to happen for me it took a
[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:49.400]  day and a half probably meaning I was I had some problems but but it was spectacular you know like
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:53.160]  30 something black balls green balls you name it i'll be gross here but this is medical stuff let's
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:57.880]  be serious this is just facts you know you know personal stuff that went on that's what most people
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:01.960]  experience they have most folks it's in the morning though what about the one percent of people or so
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:07.960]  that you've talked about that don't have any don't have any visible effect when the gallbladder
[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:15.800]  opens up or and all the stuff comes out well usually a sense we know that the liver produces
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:22.040]  over 500 bodily functions from regulating blood sugar to the metabolizing of fats is one of
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:27.240]  the best things you can do for weight loss that nobody out there is talking about it metabolizes
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:32.920]  your proteins your carbohydrates it stores vitamins and minerals it works for blood clotting
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:39.080]  cholesterol problems hormones thyroid function which is great to use the survival shield x2
[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:45.880]  because everybody's deficient in iodine what we found after studying 300,000 cases or more of people
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:51.400]  going through liver cleansing is that if you don't have results on the first one something is happening
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:56.760]  it's got to happen because this technology goes back thousands of years to ancient ayurvedic
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:49:02.680]  technology of oil pulling which is a hot topic right now so usually those individuals will tell
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:09.400]  them to go ahead and do another one and then do a third liver cleanse very rarely i can i can i
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:14.920]  can't even think of one case where someone didn't have noticeable results especially after the third
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:21.320]  now i used to think one was enough but what we realized is that most people over the age of 40
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:27.080]  only have about 50 to 60 percent of their liver functioning because of all the chemicals and
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:34.920]  toxins so each liver cleanse only boosts the liver by about 15 percent so if you're at 60 and then
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:40.200]  you do one liver cleanse then you're going to be at 75 so that's why we recommend multiple liver
[02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:45.160]  cleanses i myself do three a year and i can notice well folks doctor group we're out of time and
[02:49:45.160 --> 02:49:48.040]  thank you so much for your time sir i know you're busy on your lunch hour with all your patients

[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:23.800]  josh owens too i mean he's really smart guy with commentary but but we did what the mainstream media
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:28.600]  wouldn't do and so it's going to be a jam-packed transmission scalia is lying in state right
[02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:32.840]  now obama did go to visit that he's not going to the funeral david night has footage they're
[02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:37.720]  going to premiere of the bizarre occultic stuff that was beyond day of the dead in a very very creepy
[02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:42.760]  area so we're really investigating this they're saying how dare we investigate it and david
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:47.080]  getting into this occultic art and other points that are coming up the next hour well alex uh
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:50.680]  they had a lot of different types of art there to be fair they had a lot of southwestern art they
[02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:56.040]  had a lot of mexican art but every night we were there we had this uh all these masks that were
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:56:00.760]  staring down as the satanic mass of the uses part of mexican festivals is like okay a bit creepy
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:05.160]  we're used to it then right outside our room as i'm talking to my wife i look over to my right and i
[02:56:05.160 --> 02:56:11.720]  see this really over the top statue of devils and demons and human sacrifice and stuff and it's like
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:16.280]  wow this is this is really amazing so we got some pictures of that but here's the thing alex i'm
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:20.280]  tired of being called a conspiracy theorist i understand that's the the avenue of attack
[02:56:20.280 --> 02:56:25.880]  we don't have any theories about how scalia died the people who came up with the theories
[02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:30.360]  were this uh judge who phoned it in phoned in the inquest what didn't look so no it's a heart attack
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:34.920]  then said there are some of the drone footage behind you go ahead actually you know what we
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:39.400]  are we're skeptical alex we don't believe everything the government tells us and when they start
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:44.040]  changing their stories about the cause of death when they start changing their stories about his
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:48.360]  health we're going to be looking at so they secured this route that they took the hearst on
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:52.520]  we'll be looking at the airport that was right across uh from the ranch itself this whole thing
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:56.040]  is suspicious yes everything about that is suspicious and this is an airport for wide
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:57:01.480]  body jets i mean yes big yes gulfstream jets are are able to land there they could have flown his
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:06.760]  body back in less time than they drove it around texas there's a lot of different issues here that
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:11.560]  don't make any sense changing the stories a huge busted into the judge's office to talk to him yeah
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:16.360]  the other uh talk to the other judge i just you guys did a first-rate job for like 2020
[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:20.840]  and you did it with a shoestring budget in just a few days i mean congratulations i'm telling you
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:24.840]  man i tell you i mean you deserve an award if there was one well thank you there's awards
[02:57:24.840 --> 02:57:29.080]  defeating tyranny there's still some things that we don't have answers to i wanted to talk to people
[02:57:29.080 --> 02:57:33.160]  who were there within the local government if they would be honest and candid and open with us
[02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:37.240]  i wanted to ask them what the federal involvement was in this because all we hear about are what the
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:40.840]  sheriff did what the judge did who phoned in the inquest i would like to know what the
[02:57:40.840 --> 02:57:45.240]  federal's did with all of this because that's the key part of the story but none of us know we
[02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:51.160]  know more of the custody of a uh you know a robbery victim or a dead illegal that dies down there
[02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:56.120]  with an autopsy which should happen then we do with this key supreme court justice they say oh he
[02:57:56.120 --> 02:58:00.200]  was real isn't amazing but he wasn't i mean what does your gut now tell you that you've been down
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:05.480]  there and investigated it something nobody else has done well my gut tells me that uh they they
[02:58:05.480 --> 02:58:10.360]  really did not want to have an autopsy done because they went to great lengths to make sure an autopsy
[02:58:10.360 --> 02:58:14.840]  was not done but we had the first two judges that we talked to said well i passed it on to another
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:19.080]  person because i couldn't go the next judge said the same thing i couldn't go this one phones it in
[02:58:19.080 --> 02:58:23.800]  has a history of doing this and as we were doing that first interview with you live on the radio
[02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:28.600]  we had uh people on the sidewalk listening to what we were saying didn't know who we were
[02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:32.360]  and then came up to me afterwards pulled me off to the side said i you know i want to remain
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:35.560]  anonymous but i gotta tell you this is not the first time this type of thing has happened and
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:38.840]  then you talk to the sheriff's deputy that says the same thing we're back in 70 seconds i'll be back

[03:01:31.320 --> 03:01:34.360]  wanted to say you were glad to get out of that ranch it was creepville that was your words during
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:38.600]  the break yeah yeah we were very uncomfortable there uh for a number of reasons first of all
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:42.440]  we weren't welcome but yeah there were a lot of things that made us all feel very creepy we all
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:46.280]  said individually and i even had when i put out a picture some of the artwork there somebody said
[03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:51.160]  to me yeah this looks like the shiny and we had all said that individually yeah we need to do an
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:56.040]  article inside with the video inside the bizarre ranch where scalia died and then just list like
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:00.840]  10 of the bizarre circumstances we got one minute till i go to this clip of trump uh saying hey you
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:06.120]  know 28 pages hey bush knew hey why'd we attack iraq does that make you like trump morris i know
[03:02:06.120 --> 03:02:09.960]  you've been on the fence oh absolutely let me tell you something i was always for rand paul civil
[03:02:09.960 --> 03:02:15.000]  liberties are the front of my priorities but maybe the way that we attack this police state
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:21.240]  is by exposing the lies of 911 and if he has the guts to do that that is huge he already opposes
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:28.520]  the globalist yes exactly already opposes maybe 60 for trump the 75 or yeah yeah well you know what
[03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:33.640]  it started turning around for me once he once rand paul was out we no longer really had somebody
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:37.960]  that was directly addressing the principles of civil liberty there's no issue difference on the
[03:02:37.960 --> 03:02:43.240]  with the candidates on those issues but trump was opposing the globalist takeover in terms of
[03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:47.480]  managed trade this is not free trade it's managed trade the globalist technique of open borders
[03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:51.800]  he's a nationalist he's not perfect he's got courage and he's obviously not with him or he
[03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:56.520]  wouldn't be doing this it's too devastating he's for real he's real now is he perfect no
[03:02:56.520 --> 03:03:00.840]  but he's real we're gonna go to this clip of trump on cnn come back and you're taking over
[03:03:00.840 --> 03:03:05.240]  but address the trump thing some two and wane madson and others because this is seismic folks
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:09.800]  and donald trump is for real we now know that it's certified uh let's go to the club
[03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:15.240]  when you said that george w bush which was our last republican president
[03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:21.480]  man i respect greatly uh a person that we really fought for when he was up against a lot of
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:28.360]  these six southerners i'm a southerner you're not lied to get us in the war in iraq that that
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:35.080]  that stung me very deeply i don't i don't believe that i'm just wondering given some time passing
[03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:41.560]  um perhaps you've rethought that would you be willing to rethink that well a lot of people agree
[03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:46.360]  with what i said and i'm not talking about lying i'm not talking about not lying nobody really knows
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:50.920]  why we went into iraq uh the iraqis did not knock down it was not saddam who's saying that knocked
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:54.920]  down the world trade center okay that's just what you said was they lied they said there were weapons
[03:03:54.920 --> 03:03:58.440]  mass destruction and there were none and they knew there were none there were no weapons well
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:01.480]  there are a lot of people that think that there were a lot of people that they look bottom line
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:05.240]  there were no weapons of mass destruction they said there are weapons of mass destruction
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:10.840]  i was against the war when it started you think the president of united states george w bush
[03:04:11.720 --> 03:04:15.160]  lied well look i'm not going to get you a vote but that's okay let me i'm just giving you another
[03:04:15.160 --> 03:04:20.200]  shot let me tell you something i'll tell you very simply it may have been the worst decision
[03:04:20.200 --> 03:04:24.760]  going into iraq may have been the worst decision anybody has made any president has made the
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:29.240]  history of this country that's how bad it is okay here's here's what's happens we have spent two
[03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:35.560]  trillion dollars in iraq and fighting iraq two trillion two trillion thousands of lives right
[03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:39.800]  we have wounded wars who i love all over the place these are the most incredible these are braver
[03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:44.120]  than all of us in this room put together i look at the attitude and i work with them and these are
[03:04:44.120 --> 03:04:49.400]  great people we got nothing we have nothing we're not even there we can't even make a phone call
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:54.600]  right now but to his question i'm trying to separate i yeah let me tell you do i know i can
[03:04:54.600 --> 03:05:00.040]  tell you this i can i don't whether we lied or not he you talk about leveling with the american
[03:05:00.040 --> 03:05:05.320]  people have you always told the truth i've always tried to i'm george washington and i try not to

[03:08:55.800 --> 03:09:02.840]  madson as well as our reporters who went with us to uh the uh to west texas to investigate the hotel
[03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:07.960]  where antenin scalia died uh joe biggs and kit daniels will be joining us as well we're also
[03:09:07.960 --> 03:09:13.160]  going to have a clip from uh the interview that michael savage had with joe biggs before we get
[03:09:13.160 --> 03:09:18.680]  into the scalia death and the investigation that we did there wane i want to ask you what
[03:09:18.680 --> 03:09:24.360]  do you uh make of uh the fact that donald trump is now talking about the missing pages from 911
[03:09:24.920 --> 03:09:30.360]  well he's certainly talking about something that uh no other candidate would even even think about
[03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:36.680]  delving into most of all jeff bush oh yeah oh yeah yeah he avoided that family of course
[03:09:36.680 --> 03:09:46.440]  has a lot of reasons to keep that information secret but um i i think uh trump is uh is starting
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:52.920]  to even be more open about the what he thinks about what's wrong with his country that even
[03:09:52.920 --> 03:10:01.160]  h ross perot was oh i think so very much so uh perot of course uh also fed on a lot of discontent
[03:10:01.800 --> 03:10:07.480]  but uh trump is trump has done a couple of things here that i think are interesting
[03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:13.640]  not only is he basically overthrowing the republic republican party establishment
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:20.360]  and and sanders is doing it for other reasons on the credit side but he's also
[03:10:20.360 --> 03:10:27.400]  so he was ruled out by all the uh political professionals last year every time he made some
[03:10:27.400 --> 03:10:32.280]  controversial statement he said that's it he's done when he went after mccain and and and other
[03:10:32.280 --> 03:10:39.480]  things he's probably going to destroy the professional political consultants the ad
[03:10:39.480 --> 03:10:43.960]  advertising political advertising consultants because he's oh yeah it's not having any effect
[03:10:43.960 --> 03:10:47.640]  they've spent hundreds of millions of dollars for jeff bush he came in with this massive war chest
[03:10:47.640 --> 03:10:52.280]  that that was supposed to scare all the competition away he's spent most of it now and it hasn't done
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:58.760]  anything for him absolutely trump says he spent five million dollars whereas uh jeb has wasted
[03:10:59.400 --> 03:11:06.360]  140 million at least uh and uh if this is the case of trump wins south carolina which it looks
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:12.920]  like he's going to do and grabs another 50 delegates he's unstoppable and uh in the future
[03:11:12.920 --> 03:11:19.560]  people will say why do i need these political professional precisely uh you know hacks the
[03:11:19.560 --> 03:11:26.520]  carvills and the carl roves of the world all i need is a twitter account a facebook page and you
[03:11:26.520 --> 03:11:31.080]  know a website because that's basically how he's getting his message across i think that's a key
[03:11:31.080 --> 03:11:35.720]  part of what's going on with both his campaign and sanders campaign the fact that uh people are
[03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:40.200]  able to get the news directly they're able to bypass and are more and more willing to bypass
[03:11:40.200 --> 03:11:44.760]  the established mainstream media and uh get their information directly from the candidates
[03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:48.440]  get it from alternative sources to make up their own minds and do their own research and that's
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:54.360]  really what we're trying to do with this investigation i don't have any conspiracy theories
[03:11:54.360 --> 03:11:59.240]  about how antennas glia died i am skeptic of the various uh stories that we've heard which
[03:11:59.240 --> 03:12:03.240]  they're conflicting with each other uh that have been offered by the government i don't think that
[03:12:03.240 --> 03:12:08.280]  it you know you don't become a conspiracy theorist simply because you're skeptic you want to see a
[03:12:08.280 --> 03:12:13.320]  criminal investigation since when is a criminal investigation a conspiracy theory it's not we
[03:12:13.320 --> 03:12:19.560]  should have an investigation to rule out criminal actions that's not a theory being offered absolutely
[03:12:19.560 --> 03:12:26.440]  and and the thing is without the autopsy uh there's going to be questions obviously raised and even
[03:12:26.440 --> 03:12:32.600]  those who are dismissing the idea that there was foul play involved are saying well why wasn't there
[03:12:32.600 --> 03:12:39.480]  an autopsy uh there there's so many aspects to this story but even the washington post which only
[03:12:39.480 --> 03:12:47.560]  really exists in what and washington dc to shoot down uh alternative uh explanations for news events
[03:12:48.360 --> 03:12:55.400]  um even they're saying what was the purpose of this get together 36 uh from what we know
[03:12:55.400 --> 03:13:03.640]  males show up on the long valentine's day uh weekend it was president's uh day weekend uh at
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:11.240]  this secluded ranch out in the middle of nowhere where you have to sign a waiver uh over the medical
[03:13:11.240 --> 03:13:14.840]  issue there's yeah there's no there's no sign of waiver all of us had to sign a waiver when we
[03:13:14.840 --> 03:13:19.560]  went in they're saying that we acknowledge that there's no medical help for hours we know that
[03:13:19.560 --> 03:13:23.720]  people are coming to this ranch to engage in physical activities like whale hunting horseback
[03:13:23.720 --> 03:13:30.200]  riding atv riding okay all of this stuff so that brings all of that brings to question uh the the
[03:13:30.200 --> 03:13:36.440]  stories about his particular health okay that we've heard as well as what was really happening at
[03:13:36.440 --> 03:13:39.960]  the ranch and you've got a story about that we're going to talk about that in detail i want to bring
[03:13:39.960 --> 03:13:45.160]  in our other reporters who are also joining us from the situation room joe biggs and kit daniels
[03:13:45.160 --> 03:13:52.040]  give us uh your quick take on what you think uh behind the uh the trump exposure of the missing
[03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:57.160]  pages calling out the bush family for being uh liars about the weapons of mass destruction
[03:13:57.720 --> 03:14:04.040]  thank you david um i think it's exceptionally great that he is doing that you know uh i was
[03:14:04.040 --> 03:14:08.600]  more like you said on the rand paul side and now that he's out there's really nowhere else to look
[03:14:08.600 --> 03:14:13.080]  other than donald trump and the fact that he's coming out he's willing to put himself out there
[03:14:13.080 --> 03:14:18.520]  make himself a target and he has made himself a target by bringing up the situation with the 28
[03:14:18.520 --> 03:14:25.400]  pages so it's unprecedented to see someone like this a candidate running for this position for
[03:14:25.400 --> 03:14:31.080]  president united states and seeing him coming out hitting hard going after the pope when the pope
[03:14:31.080 --> 03:14:36.840]  attacks him you know going after the bush family going after the clinton's you know i'm moving up
[03:14:36.840 --> 03:14:42.760]  too as far as uh you know my uh wanting to back donald trump i think he's doing some amazing stuff
[03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:47.800]  now you know he's his unfiltered view on the world and how he gets up there and says what he wants
[03:14:47.800 --> 03:14:51.560]  uh i i believe he's going to do some great stuff for america what do you think yeah i think it's
[03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:56.440]  really key that he's got a very unfiltered view of the world i mean most politicians when you see
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:15:00.760]  in a general election there's always something that's off limits for all of them to talk about
[03:15:00.760 --> 03:15:05.720]  i think even in the 90s and 92 and bill clinton and uh george h.w. bush were running against each
[03:15:05.720 --> 03:15:09.160]  other they had a gentleman's agreement not to talk about the sub scandal that had going on
[03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:14.840]  arkansas about guns and i think it was at the time that what that's what it was but it's yeah
[03:15:14.840 --> 03:15:18.840]  it's great he's talking about 28 pages that's typically something that's completely off limits
[03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:24.600]  for any politician no matter what kind of election you're running to talk about i mean even like in
[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:28.440]  a local like county commissioner you can't talk about 9-11 you're going to get run out of office
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:35.000]  so he's really kind of pushing the overton window like i've said before about what he what
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:40.040]  politicians are are allowed to say that's not going to kill them in the election in the polls
[03:15:40.600 --> 03:15:44.120]  yes weird because anytime i've ever spoke to any kind of political person it's always got to be
[03:15:44.120 --> 03:15:47.880]  off record they'll kind of be like you know we watch a show yeah you know we agree with this this is
[03:15:47.880 --> 03:15:51.960]  the first time i've seen a candidate someone in this position with this kind of power this kind of
[03:15:51.960 --> 03:15:59.000]  a social pool so to say yeah to actually come out and hard charge these issues really important
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:03.880]  issues that americans should be concerned about i mean the fact that he's saying hey if i if i'm
[03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:07.240]  elected president i'm going to give you the information you're going to know who brought
[03:16:07.240 --> 03:16:12.200]  down those towers and like you said iraq saddam hussein nothing to do with it i think the key
[03:16:12.200 --> 03:16:17.640]  thing let me let me break in here quickly uh joe and and kit i think the key thing with this too
[03:16:17.640 --> 03:16:24.200]  for me is as i said before i'm very much interested in shutting down the attacks on our civil liberties
[03:16:24.200 --> 03:16:29.240]  but where did they all begin they all began with 9-11 that was always the basis for well we have
[03:16:29.240 --> 03:16:34.840]  to take all of your freedoms we have to shut down the constitution because 9-11 if the people
[03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:42.280]  understand that they have been lied to that the basis of the security state is a lie that is huge
[03:16:42.280 --> 03:16:48.280]  and so that is a key thing that if he will attack on that particular basis and say you've got these
[03:16:48.280 --> 03:16:53.000]  pages that you're not releasing let us see that and he's already called out jeb bush
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:57.320]  online about weapons of mass destruction it's amazing to me that he would get booed for that
[03:16:57.320 --> 03:17:01.960]  at the GOP debate because everybody knows that it was based on a lie do you think it was a smart
[03:17:01.960 --> 03:17:06.760]  play though david for him to come out now and say that or do you think he should have waited until
[03:17:06.760 --> 03:17:11.080]  you know uh maybe after he wins the election possibly no i think he should do it right now
[03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:14.440]  because i think it's going to look when he called out regardless of what happens with
[03:17:14.440 --> 03:17:20.520]  the 9-11 issue a lot of people most people don't realize there are missing pages from the 9-11 report
[03:17:20.520 --> 03:17:24.200]  that did not third building they don't realize that congressmen have wanted to see that as well
[03:17:24.200 --> 03:17:28.280]  so i think that's very important to get that on the table but everybody knows that the weapons of
[03:17:28.280 --> 03:17:34.280]  mass destruction lie the basis of iraq they all know that that was a lie to call him out on that
[03:17:34.840 --> 03:17:40.840]  gives him stature that he uh did not have before and a lot of people's eyes in terms of my uh
[03:17:40.840 --> 03:17:44.680]  viewpoint gave trump a great deal of stature to call out jeb on those lies what do you think
[03:17:44.680 --> 03:17:51.000]  way well the thing is something else here trump is a major real estate developer in new york city
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:57.400]  especially manhattan he's been in in this game for a long long time he knows all the players
[03:17:57.400 --> 03:18:02.760]  he knows he knows he knows a lot about the world trade center from the time it was being built
[03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:10.040]  and uh so uh you know we have bloomberg for example threatening to get in because he
[03:18:10.040 --> 03:18:16.200]  doesn't like trump yeah and uh trump doesn't really care for him i guess but bloomberg's
[03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:23.240]  friend is larry silverstein who of course was the pull it down guy who uh yeah pull it down
[03:18:23.240 --> 03:18:28.200]  so what's building seven what's you know what is bloomberg so afraid of here is he afraid that
[03:18:28.200 --> 03:18:35.080]  possibly uh you know the next thing trump's going to talk about is building seven yeah where is this
[03:18:35.080 --> 03:18:39.640]  all going to end with donald trump and people are getting nervous bloomberg's getting nervous
[03:18:39.640 --> 03:18:44.280]  and some of the other real estate people up in new york are getting nervous and and i would say that
[03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:49.800]  trump knows a lot more he hasn't talked about about 9 11 but he may be saving it maybe he's
[03:18:49.800 --> 03:18:54.520]  going to put it in his inaugural address that would wouldn't that make a lot of people upset
[03:18:54.520 --> 03:18:58.600]  that'd be great you had a comment kit go ahead i remember when uh joe biggs went up to new york
[03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:03.480]  city and he talked to people about building seven and a lot of people didn't realize that the
[03:19:03.480 --> 03:19:08.840]  the replacement building that was built on the site of building seven was new yeah they always
[03:19:08.840 --> 03:19:12.520]  thought it had been there this entire time so yeah you're right like joe said people don't
[03:19:12.520 --> 03:19:15.960]  know about the missy 28 pages they don't even know about building seven and the fact that it's
[03:19:15.960 --> 03:19:21.960]  been there's a new one where the last one was taken down by explosives and a lot of people
[03:19:21.960 --> 03:19:28.360]  a lot of people don't realize uh three buildings two planes we just need that's the common core
[03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:32.920]  math of 9 11 you know we got three buildings that fell down right in their footprint
[03:19:32.920 --> 03:19:37.320]  only two planes hitting two of those buildings but when we come back we're going to take a look
[03:19:37.320 --> 03:19:43.000]  at what we found out as we travel to west texas as we went to the sabola creek ranch
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:49.240]  looking into the oddities around the inquest as well as some other things with the airport next

[03:24:05.720 --> 03:24:09.320]  welcome back to the alex joneshaw i'm david night here with wane meds and joe biggs and
[03:24:09.320 --> 03:24:14.600]  kit daniels we've just returned from investigating uh the death of anton and scalia trying to get
[03:24:14.600 --> 03:24:20.600]  some answers to some questions that really didn't make any sense of course we all saw some odd things
[03:24:20.600 --> 03:24:25.880]  that's why we went out there we saw a story that was changing about the cause of death we saw a
[03:24:25.880 --> 03:24:31.080]  phone in inquest and then we got out there and we found some other things that were perhaps even
[03:24:31.080 --> 03:24:38.360]  stranger the fact that we had this first tour of texas that they took the body on when there was an
[03:24:38.360 --> 03:24:43.640]  airfield right across from the ranch that raised some additional questions and of course we have a
[03:24:43.640 --> 03:24:49.240]  story up on info worse icon from wane madson who is here with me the media ignores why scalia was
[03:24:49.240 --> 03:24:53.400]  on a free trip to this swanky resort we're going to talk about that as well and then we're going
[03:24:53.400 --> 03:24:58.440]  to talk about the feeling that we all got in terms of the fact that we were staying at the
[03:24:58.440 --> 03:25:04.280]  shining hotel there was uh some really unusual uh aspects of staying at that hotel i think we were
[03:25:04.280 --> 03:25:09.800]  all very happy to leave it's a beautiful swanky hotel but uh there were some issues that we
[03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:13.960]  talked about and we'll show you some footage of that as well before we get to that i want to let
[03:25:13.960 --> 03:25:19.400]  you know about the sales that we have and and i was i've been talking about the 10 discount on
[03:25:19.400 --> 03:25:25.080]  auto ship for a long time and i did not realize that it was that it extends beyond the initial
[03:25:25.080 --> 03:25:29.800]  sign-up period i just clarified that with alex when i was talking to him said you mean you get
[03:25:29.800 --> 03:25:34.040]  10 percent each month when you're on the auto ship and he says yeah that's part of it so i thought
[03:25:34.040 --> 03:25:39.160]  it was just an incentive to sign up that's the way the the information was put out there for me so
[03:25:39.160 --> 03:25:45.720]  if you sign up for anything at info wars store dot com at info wars uh life dot com you and get

[03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:38.040]  hotel a little bit everybody can chime in we've got um uh some information uh with a hotel um
[03:26:39.160 --> 03:26:44.440]  i i don't know i we all had this same statement i had texted my wife i said you know it is very
[03:26:44.440 --> 03:26:50.040]  isolated very quiet uh there's some just a few people here they're very suspicious of us so they're
[03:26:50.040 --> 03:26:55.720]  kind of watching everything we do peeking around the corners looking at his head i feel like i'm
[03:26:55.720 --> 03:27:01.000]  at the shining hotel even though it's not that cold here and that's and everybody as they came in
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:08.040]  had that same statement yeah i mean i i i thank god there wasn't a raging blizzard while we were
[03:27:08.040 --> 03:27:14.920]  there i would have really gotten a concern but um the obviously the people who work for uh
[03:27:14.920 --> 03:27:22.920]  mr poindexter john b poindexter who's the owner it was built in 1993 and it's very interesting
[03:27:22.920 --> 03:27:30.760]  uh we talked about the airfield the airfield which is the sabola uh creek ranch air airfield or airport
[03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:39.480]  is owned by a company called southwestern uh holdings incorporated out of houston who's the
[03:27:39.480 --> 03:27:45.400]  owner mr poindexter yeah so there's an airport right across from the ranch and it's owned by
[03:27:45.400 --> 03:27:50.760]  the owner of the owner of the ranch yeah it's also serviced by a charter airline company
[03:27:50.760 --> 03:27:59.320]  uh called sabola air who's the owner mr poindexter yeah so this is like he's got the whole thing
[03:27:59.320 --> 03:28:04.040]  he's got the whole thing wrapped up um and of course the issues that you raise in here and
[03:28:04.040 --> 03:28:09.560]  that's also been raised by a couple of mainstream media outlets why were all these people there who
[03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:14.440]  are these people was this a free gift to scalia because uh point extras companies he's got many
[03:28:14.440 --> 03:28:18.680]  companies one of his company had companies had been before the supreme court and there was a
[03:28:18.680 --> 03:28:25.560]  favorable decision on that supreme court and and uh scalia sided with that yeah well basically the
[03:28:25.560 --> 03:28:31.960]  court decided not to hear the case it was brought uh it was an age discrimination case brought by
[03:28:31.960 --> 03:28:36.120]  an employee and they just said you know we're not going to hear it so which allowed it to stand
[03:28:36.120 --> 03:28:43.880]  which allowed the lower court decision against the plaintiff against the um plane of the stand
[03:28:43.880 --> 03:28:52.520]  now um scalia if you look at his record he's one of the uh top two frequent flyers on boondoggles
[03:28:52.520 --> 03:28:57.720]  where somebody picks up the tab we know he had been in asia recently on a speaking tour he had
[03:28:57.720 --> 03:29:03.160]  been in three weeks before he was in Dallas where the the marshall service and the secret service
[03:29:03.160 --> 03:29:07.720]  arranged for him to get a haircut now isn't that interesting and they can't be bothered we're told
[03:29:07.720 --> 03:29:12.200]  he can't be bothered about this right yeah we're told after the fact oh you know for the guy who
[03:29:12.200 --> 03:29:17.240]  went with him on that trip to asia was talking about how strong and vital and energetic he was
[03:29:17.240 --> 03:29:22.600]  he said that the day after then two days later he goes yeah he'd just essentially been given a death
[03:29:22.600 --> 03:29:28.200]  sentence by his uh doctor who's a rear admiral of politician in washington and yet this doctor
[03:29:28.200 --> 03:29:33.240]  allowed him to travel to this remote area where you have to sign a release saying that uh you
[03:29:33.240 --> 03:29:37.240]  understand there's no hospital care here he stood down didn't have a physician traveling with him
[03:29:37.240 --> 03:29:42.680]  did not have any security with him and yet he had secret service arranging for his haircuts

[03:33:09.880 --> 03:33:17.640]  network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and i'm joining me now is wane
[03:33:17.640 --> 03:33:22.920]  madsen joe begs kit daniels we have all been out along with uh josh owens our cameraman we've all
[03:33:22.920 --> 03:33:28.680]  been investigating uh the circumstances of justice scalia's death because there were a lot of unusual
[03:33:28.680 --> 03:33:34.200]  things that were told and uh we're pretty skeptical when we get uh answers from the government we
[03:33:34.200 --> 03:33:38.520]  don't just repeat the press releases like the mainstream media does you know if you are skeptical
[03:33:38.520 --> 03:33:43.800]  if you question what is being told to you especially if they change the story uh as
[03:33:43.800 --> 03:33:48.920]  the days go along then you are called a conspiracy theorist we didn't offer any conspiracy theories
[03:33:48.920 --> 03:33:54.920]  about how or why justice scalia died we simply said we would like to see you follow procedure
[03:33:54.920 --> 03:34:00.520]  and do an investigation so we went to the area we tried to talk to some of the people involved we
[03:34:00.520 --> 03:34:06.040]  did talk to uh many people in the area had some productive interviews one of the things besides
[03:34:06.040 --> 03:34:12.040]  the questions raised by the circumstances of his death the lack of an autopsy uh the what they did
[03:34:12.040 --> 03:34:16.760]  with the body afterwards uh driving it all over texas instead of flying it back to uh washington
[03:34:17.640 --> 03:34:22.360]  in addition to that of course there's the issue of of the hotel and why there were 36 guests there
[03:34:22.360 --> 03:34:27.560]  and of course while we were there the entire hotel was uh empty and as i said earlier i think
[03:34:27.560 --> 03:34:33.400]  that's one of the reasons that uh it kind of felt like the shining we were the only people in that
[03:34:33.400 --> 03:34:39.160]  hotel uh joe and kit uh did you get that feeling as well yeah of course i mean as soon as we walked
[03:34:39.160 --> 03:34:45.320]  into the uh to the ranch you know you're already signing this waiver you know and then the lady
[03:34:45.320 --> 03:34:50.520]  hands me a piece of cardboard with just the name of the room uh and uh colonial north i think was
[03:34:50.520 --> 03:34:55.800]  what it was and i go okay where's the key and she goes we don't we don't use keys that's a really
[03:34:55.800 --> 03:35:00.600]  good point it's it's really weird i've never been to a hotel where you you lock the door from the
[03:35:00.600 --> 03:35:05.800]  inside but you can't lock it from the outside so you go out quail hunting or atv riding what not
[03:35:06.440 --> 03:35:10.440]  but you have to leave you leave your possessions in your room but you can't lock them up yeah and if
[03:35:10.440 --> 03:35:15.240]  you are in there asleep and your door's locked who's the only person that can get in exactly someone
[03:35:15.240 --> 03:35:20.440]  who works there of course there's also no telephone in case you need to call because uh you have
[03:35:20.440 --> 03:35:24.680]  health issues like we're told i mean i remember when we sat down that first night for dinner you
[03:35:24.680 --> 03:35:28.520]  know i was actually getting ready to take picture of all of us at dinner and it was on that selfie
[03:35:28.520 --> 03:35:32.840]  mode and when i had the camera turned around i could see what was behind me and i turned around
[03:35:32.840 --> 03:35:37.640]  and there were all these like demonic devil looking masks all up on the top part of the wall
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:42.920]  lining that whole dinner area yeah when it was yeah it was super creepy it reminded me that uh
[03:35:42.920 --> 03:35:46.680]  yeah doesn't move the eyes wide shut yeah yeah exactly that's because of the b-roll you can run
[03:35:46.680 --> 03:35:50.680]  of that we've got some pictures of those masks that are that are there yeah it's it's really creepy
[03:35:50.680 --> 03:35:57.000]  that glia's last meal was perhaps under all those masks yeah i'm very devout catholic also i mean
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:03.000]  another another strange thing about this resort ranch uh whatever you want to call it is in the
[03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:08.120]  area where david and kit said where you guys were these beds on the outside yeah exactly on the whole
[03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:14.360]  area you know and and and having these private events that are minned during valentine's weekend
[03:36:14.360 --> 03:36:19.880]  you know it's really an odd thing yeah to get put in the perspective it's kind of like you had
[03:36:19.880 --> 03:36:25.720]  like a hallway slash patio outside all the rooms but the wing we were staying at was in this patio
[03:36:25.720 --> 03:36:30.680]  were like like beds there weren't even day beds they were actual beds that were set up you know you
[03:36:30.680 --> 03:36:36.200]  had beds and the bookshelves and then reclining chairs sofas some other statue things exactly so
[03:36:36.200 --> 03:36:41.560]  it was really odd that you had not only these beds but even in the rooms all the beds were like twin
[03:36:41.560 --> 03:36:46.840]  beds it's like this is not a place you if you're married you would take your wife to yeah yeah
[03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:52.120]  it's very unusual and of course the fact that they had virtually no guests the entire time we were
[03:36:52.120 --> 03:36:58.600]  there that i think raised questions to me which you raise in your article wane uh what is the purpose
[03:36:58.600 --> 03:37:05.000]  of this hotel i mean is this simply a a prestigious tax write-off that he can bring in uh political
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:08.920]  friends and and you know have private parties with them because he's saying he does this frequently
[03:37:08.920 --> 03:37:14.920]  does this multiple times a year bring in uh several dozen guests and and yet we see absolutely
[03:37:14.920 --> 03:37:19.320]  no paying guests while we're there except for we're the only people in the entire hotel that's why
[03:37:19.320 --> 03:37:24.360]  one of the reasons why it felt so creepy and he said that he gives a allows these people to stay for
[03:37:24.360 --> 03:37:33.400]  free yet we uh we also uh point extra the owner said that um uh he paid for everything but the
[03:37:33.400 --> 03:37:40.440]  flight in well we know that skali arrived on a private jet at the airport at the ranch airport
[03:37:40.440 --> 03:37:47.160]  around noon on that friday he was found dead saturday morning um and now we're told that of course
[03:37:47.160 --> 03:37:53.000]  he didn't pay skali didn't pay for that trip so what is this all about you know we know politicians
[03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:59.320]  are uh owned and operated by special interests but the problem with judges especially supreme
[03:37:59.320 --> 03:38:06.440]  court justices is that the decisions they make which establish case law far outlives them and the
[03:38:06.440 --> 03:38:12.600]  presidents who uh nominated them and and those laws affect every man woman and child in this
[03:38:12.600 --> 03:38:19.560]  country for decades if not centuries afterwards so the fact is that he's like involved in uh
[03:38:20.280 --> 03:38:26.680]  accepting uh gratuities from a guy who had a case before the court i think raises more troubling
[03:38:26.680 --> 03:38:31.640]  issues than his suspicious death a man at that stature when you find someone like that dead that
[03:38:31.640 --> 03:38:36.680]  that's already there's already motive there there's already motive there it's really funny how they
[03:38:36.680 --> 03:38:41.320]  can fly him into this private airport but they can't fly his body out of the private airport
[03:38:41.320 --> 03:38:46.360]  they got to take his body to alpine i think to get him bombed or was it new met uh alfasa
[03:38:46.360 --> 03:38:49.720]  yeah let's talk about the security throughout that they take because that was that was very
[03:38:49.720 --> 03:38:56.040]  interesting i'll take a document shot of the pictures that wane has here these are postcards
[03:38:56.040 --> 03:39:02.040]  that he got at the hotel and you can see this uh first one right here that has a chinook helicopter
[03:39:02.040 --> 03:39:08.120]  that is flying right over the man-made lake there when and the uh the room that the skali was in
[03:39:08.120 --> 03:39:14.360]  was right adjacent to where the helicopter is but then the other picture shows the airport that is
[03:39:14.360 --> 03:39:20.040]  right across from there and of course gulfstream uh planes can land in that airport that is owned
[03:39:20.040 --> 03:39:26.040]  by the same person who owns the uh hotel that's right that's uh of course gulfstream uh airplanes
[03:39:26.040 --> 03:39:30.600]  that look somewhat like this i'll put that there and then the interesting thing is the route that
[03:39:30.600 --> 03:39:36.840]  they took and the amount of time that's involved here from the sabola creek ranch to marfa where the
[03:39:36.840 --> 03:39:42.840]  judge cinderella guavara was okay is only 43 minutes but of course it was too far for her to drive
[03:39:42.840 --> 03:39:48.680]  that's why she did the phone uh phone in in quest she could not drive 43 minutes now understand that
[03:39:48.680 --> 03:39:56.120]  in this area of texas 43 minutes is next door okay everything but david there's a lot of business
[03:39:56.120 --> 03:40:01.080]  going on in marfa i mean she swam she was swamped with media requests she's swamped with a lot of
[03:40:01.080 --> 03:40:07.880]  things you know marfa's a booming town they got those lights i mean she's she's busy yeah well let's
[03:40:07.880 --> 03:40:13.480]  take a look at the the route that the hearse did uh after after the death okay there's a lot of time
[03:40:13.480 --> 03:40:19.880]  involved there uh they took the uh the body from the sabola creek ranch and they went and let's put
[03:40:19.880 --> 03:40:25.720]  this uh this document here you can see they go from the ranch here they go up to marfa okay 43
[03:40:25.720 --> 03:40:30.040]  minutes but then they there's a funeral home that's in marfa but they don't use that funeral home
[03:40:30.040 --> 03:40:37.320]  instead they go to alpine over here okay now that whole trip from the ranch to alpine that is uh one
[03:40:37.320 --> 03:40:43.640]  hour and uh 12 minutes then later they go and i'll show you this ranch this picture here they go back
[03:40:43.640 --> 03:40:49.000]  in the opposite direction they backtrack and go further west they go from alpine then to el paso
[03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:54.840]  and that is a three hour 15 minute ride okay so total time they've driven this body around passing
[03:40:54.840 --> 03:40:58.840]  up two funeral homes and two different two different towns with funeral homes in them
[03:40:58.840 --> 03:41:04.280]  is four hours and 30 minutes now if they were to use a gulf stream which is across the street okay
[03:41:05.240 --> 03:41:11.320]  the average cruising speed of gulf stream is 560 miles an hour three hours and 20 minutes to go
[03:41:11.320 --> 03:41:18.760]  1900 miles which is the distance to uh dc right so instead of taking a three hour 20 minute
[03:41:18.760 --> 03:41:26.680]  flight to dc okay they take a four hour 30 minute hearse ride around texas and even if even though
[03:41:26.680 --> 03:41:31.480]  we know that the wife didn't want missus glia requested no autopsy there could have still been a
[03:41:32.920 --> 03:41:40.760]  an inquest done by his doctor at Bethesda naval hospital or or a certified medical examiner
[03:41:40.760 --> 03:41:48.040]  in his home county of fairfax county virginia but not uh this situation where a judge uh
[03:41:49.080 --> 03:41:53.880]  makes a determination without the body being viewed by her over the telephone this is
[03:41:53.880 --> 03:41:59.560]  yeah wane she gets she got a letter from a lawyer a texas attorney from woodlands and he said that
[03:41:59.560 --> 03:42:05.160]  quote cinderella gabara is a county judge and she made the decision that's just as glia died of
[03:42:05.160 --> 03:42:10.520]  natural causes uh ever she did exceed her authority in making this declaration declaration
[03:42:11.640 --> 03:42:16.360]  so yeah i mean and like well we talked to the the former uh deputy under the sheriff out there
[03:42:16.360 --> 03:42:22.440]  in presidio county was that he could get an autopsy all the time not only that but it was
[03:42:22.440 --> 03:42:27.080]  it was he was it was unprecedented for a county judge or a just for the peace to not show up
[03:42:27.080 --> 03:42:31.480]  to see a dead body when the circumstances of the death are not known well last night even in the
[03:42:31.480 --> 03:42:35.080]  new york post came out with an article it was yesterday sometime saying they talked to one of
[03:42:35.080 --> 03:42:40.280]  the top pathologists uh up in new york and said that they believe it's extremely possible
[03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:45.560]  for scalia to have been poisoned yeah they said that that is definitely a possibility and the fact
[03:42:45.560 --> 03:42:51.400]  that this body's taken el paso everything's drained out thrown the sewage there's no way of ever
[03:42:51.400 --> 03:42:56.920]  knowing now we'll be asking this question for years on and that'll be a top story for years
[03:42:56.920 --> 03:43:00.520]  people talking about it's ridiculous what they've did to this man because this is a man who fought
[03:43:00.520 --> 03:43:06.360]  for the truth this is a man who followed the law and no one had his back no one followed the law
[03:43:06.360 --> 03:43:10.120]  to make sure that he was taken care of after he left and that's why we went out there because
[03:43:10.120 --> 03:43:16.520]  here you have someone who is the major obstacle in the way of obama's agendas a major obstacle in
[03:43:16.520 --> 03:43:22.600]  the way of globalist agendas he's the person who really uh holds the balance of power in the supreme
[03:43:22.600 --> 03:43:28.920]  court in the sense that he was the intellectual center of the conservatives and um that in and
[03:43:28.920 --> 03:43:35.080]  of itself says that we should have an investigation to rule out conspiracies to rule out fair foul
[03:43:35.080 --> 03:43:40.840]  play and we went out there to ask these questions the judge would not talk to us we've shown you
[03:43:40.840 --> 03:43:45.560]  the videos of that and as we were doing the report we also had someone come up to us and say
[03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:49.800]  this is not the first time this has happened we've had a mysterious death back in 2013
[03:43:50.360 --> 03:43:56.680]  and it looked to uh many of us the the immediate family as well as to the railroad investigators
[03:43:56.680 --> 03:44:02.040]  this is a body that was run over laying on the tracks they said it looks like this lady
[03:44:02.040 --> 03:44:06.200]  who had only been married for six months it looks like she was placed there as she was
[03:44:06.200 --> 03:44:11.240]  unconscious that was what the railroad investigator said however the same judge the same sheriff ruled
[03:44:11.240 --> 03:44:17.160]  it a suicide on the basis that she had resigned her job recently and she had just recently been
[03:44:17.160 --> 03:44:20.920]  married as well so she had had a change in life circumstances so the family was very upset about
[03:44:20.920 --> 03:44:25.640]  that many people in the town were upset about that and so we looked to see since the sheriff wouldn't
[03:44:25.640 --> 03:44:30.600]  talk to us since the judge would not talk to us so he said well let's ask a deputy about this
[03:44:30.600 --> 03:44:34.680]  because it turns out that there's an election coming up a former deputy is running against
[03:44:34.680 --> 03:44:41.880]  this sheriff and he also had a lawsuit at one point in time alleging that the sheriff had fired
[03:44:41.880 --> 03:44:47.000]  him for unjust cause saying that there was a gun that the sheriff was demanding be turned back to
[03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:52.680]  a friend of his and there was a restraining order against this friend ultimately the judge of the
[03:44:52.680 --> 03:44:59.480]  sheriff set that aside and returned the gun to the son of the individual who himself had a felony
[03:44:59.480 --> 03:45:05.880]  and so he said that there's been a lot of situations like this where the the investigations are handled
[03:45:05.880 --> 03:45:11.880]  differently depending on who it is as well as the way the citizens are treated yeah David the
[03:45:12.600 --> 03:45:18.520]  very key thing that this deputy said was the fact that he worked that case in 2013 with the lady that
[03:45:18.520 --> 03:45:23.400]  was found dead in the railroad and the deputy said he would had the most experience of all of them
[03:45:23.400 --> 03:45:27.640]  including the sheriff on homicide investigations yeah he said he'd been trained by Texas Rangers
[03:45:27.640 --> 03:45:32.520]  exactly the the sheriff called him in that late that night to deal with the body but he had him
[03:45:32.520 --> 03:45:37.880]  only doing traffic control in Marfa Texas a town of 2,000 people yeah it's really weird though this
[03:45:37.880 --> 03:45:42.680]  guy did have the most training and then the same thing happened with Scalia you know this sheriff
[03:45:42.680 --> 03:45:47.800]  with no training whatsoever a U.S. Marshal that has no training in this you have a judge that
[03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:53.000]  can't even take a 43 minute drive out there to do her job because the Supreme Court justice
[03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:58.920]  was found dead you know you have this this this this path and this is something that happened
[03:45:58.920 --> 03:46:03.480]  over a period of at least 14 hours we talked about the security's route yeah so in 14 hours
[03:46:03.480 --> 03:46:08.200]  somebody knew who they were dealing with by that time yeah before we run out of time I want to play
[03:46:08.200 --> 03:46:12.920]  some excerpts from an interview that Joe Biggs had with Michael Savage who is also concerned
[03:46:12.920 --> 03:46:18.520]  about the way this was handled let's play that interview Joe Biggs here with info wars.com now
[03:46:18.520 --> 03:46:25.720]  in February 16 2016 I had the opportunity to go on the savage nation and speak with Dr. Michael
[03:46:25.720 --> 03:46:32.040]  Savage about our investigation into the death of Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia here are a
[03:46:32.040 --> 03:46:37.960]  few clips from that interview joining us right now as a reporter for info wars.com Joe Biggs Joe
[03:46:37.960 --> 03:46:45.560]  you're down in Texas where are you near the judge's chambers we are in Marfa Texas just outside of
[03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:52.600]  county judge Cinderella Guerrero's office. Cinderella couldn't pronounce the words myocardial infarction
[03:46:52.600 --> 03:46:57.880]  how could she declare he died of a myocardial infarction then change her mind. Well here's the
[03:46:57.880 --> 03:47:03.160]  thing you have to understand Dr. Savage is the first two just to the piece that were called
[03:47:03.160 --> 03:47:07.480]  were out of town that day they were about 120 miles away at some event even they tell me when
[03:47:07.480 --> 03:47:11.720]  that name came over the wire they didn't drop what they were doing and take the time to drive
[03:47:11.720 --> 03:47:17.720]  a few hours to come out here now before that John Coyne Dexter the guy who owns the ranch
[03:47:17.720 --> 03:47:21.880]  called the feds the feds flew in you mean to tell me they could have picked one of these people up
[03:47:21.880 --> 03:47:29.080]  instead it was passed on to a third person judge Cinderella now in the past in 2016 she has made
[03:47:29.080 --> 03:47:34.280]  some botched calls before oh really what did Cinderella do in the past that was questionable
[03:47:34.920 --> 03:47:41.000]  in 2013 there was an incident in big band where an unconscious woman was laying on the train tracks
[03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:46.920]  a train ran over her and sliced her into pieces now the the rero company came out did their own
[03:47:46.920 --> 03:47:51.160]  internal investigation said that it should be investigated the family came out and said they
[03:47:51.160 --> 03:47:57.320]  wanted an investigation they called Cinderella and she goes oh no suicide and ended it right there
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:05.640]  did not go in did not do an investigation so so so Cinderella is is uh who is she she's a low
[03:48:05.640 --> 03:48:14.120]  she's a low grade local judge pretty much she's a county judge here in Martha Martha Texas wow
[03:48:14.120 --> 03:48:17.800]  I know I mean there's a lot of things surrounding this I mean like you said before I've heard other
[03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:23.960]  people say that this was a republican president a ranch owned by a republican donor and it was a
[03:48:23.960 --> 03:48:28.920]  liberal judge who died out there the entire left would be screaming and crying asking for an investigation
[03:48:28.920 --> 03:48:33.080]  as soon as this man's his name came down over the wire this place should have been locked down
[03:48:33.080 --> 03:48:37.000]  they should have called for an investigation they should have done an autopsy toxicology
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:41.880]  and all of that instead they take the body and drive it to El Paso now we have an investigator in
[03:48:41.880 --> 03:48:46.520]  El Paso right now who just spoke to the mortician who did the embalming they just drained his
[03:48:46.520 --> 03:48:52.920]  fluids and threw them into the El Paso sewage oh my god you're kidding me they did that already
[03:48:52.920 --> 03:49:01.320]  yes that has already been done oh my god oh so they're covering it up already this is terrifying
[03:49:01.320 --> 03:49:07.320]  you would think this would happen in Paraguay or in Uruguay in the 1970s but it's happening
[03:49:07.320 --> 03:49:16.280]  here now under under our dear leader Joe has a single politician one politician called for
[03:49:16.280 --> 03:49:22.600]  an investigation um not that I'm aware of but all I hear are homicide investigators there's a one
[03:49:22.600 --> 03:49:28.360]  of the main homicide investigators for DC people police all over the country have said that this
[03:49:28.360 --> 03:49:34.200]  should be investigated there's an outcry by people who are specialized in this now you have this uh
[03:49:34.200 --> 03:49:39.240]  you know uh texas or this us marshal that came out he's not even trained in homicide and yet he's
[03:49:39.240 --> 03:49:44.200]  the one calling and going oh you know this is just natural causes let's pass away right he was that
[03:49:44.200 --> 03:49:49.560]  that us marshal was appointed by Obama have you interviewed him no not yet we just got into Martha
[03:49:49.560 --> 03:49:52.840]  we're going to the ranch next we're going to be here for the next few days we've got a long list
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:58.200]  of people that we will I suggest that you bring your food with you uh I would suggest you don't
[03:49:58.200 --> 03:50:02.680]  accept their hospitality for uh any any meals oh yeah I'm definitely throwing the pillows off the
[03:50:02.680 --> 03:50:08.760]  bed by the way do you know anyone who sleeps with a pillow over their head I haven't met one yet
[03:50:08.760 --> 03:50:12.040]  I've never heard of it I've actually stopped and talked to a few people and asked them they thought
[03:50:12.040 --> 03:50:16.360]  that that was normal and everyone's going uh no that's pretty uh pretty well maybe it's normal
[03:50:16.360 --> 03:50:20.840]  but you see it it's maybe it's not normal in that texas county but it could be normal amongst
[03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:28.520]  italian-americans of a of a 79 years of age we have to interview all 79 year old male italian-americans
[03:50:28.520 --> 03:50:33.240]  and see what percentage percentage of them sleep with pillows over their head because I'm sure the
[03:50:33.240 --> 03:50:36.600]  washington post will record we don't have time to play the rest of that interview but you can see
[03:50:36.600 --> 03:50:40.760]  that up on alex jones's youtube channel again that was michael savage talking to uh joe biggs
[03:50:40.760 --> 03:50:45.720]  as we were reporting the situation there we're going to be back with wane madsen cat daniels and
[03:50:45.720 --> 03:50:51.960]  we're going to talk about uh scalia's son saying that conspiracy theories about his father's death
[03:50:51.960 --> 03:51:03.320]  are hurtful we'll be right back are you sneezing coughing and aching do you have a sore throat

[03:54:08.360 --> 03:54:12.840]  welcome back to the alex joneshawm david night here with wane madson joe bigs kit daniels and
[03:54:12.840 --> 03:54:18.760]  we have just returned from texas asking questions as many people are asking questions of what happened
[03:54:18.760 --> 03:54:24.200]  there and as you're looking at that b-roll there that was uh those were the uh kind of satanic mass
[03:54:24.200 --> 03:54:30.920]  that hovered over our dinner table every night as we ate alone in this massive hotel and as i said
[03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:35.560]  we're not the only ones who are asking questions we have a retired homicide investigator uh mr richie
[03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:39.160]  says you've got a justice of the peace pronouncing death while not on the scene without any medical
[03:54:39.720 --> 03:54:44.280]  training a pining that the justice died of a heart attack what medical proof exists of a
[03:54:44.280 --> 03:54:49.320]  myocardial infarction why not a cerebral hemorrhage right so there's all these different issues and yet
[03:54:49.320 --> 03:54:55.880]  his family says uh that conspiracy theories about his father's death his son says are hurtful i
[03:54:55.880 --> 03:55:02.040]  think what is hurtful is to set aside standard operating procedures especially in a debt the
[03:55:02.040 --> 03:55:07.800]  death of someone who is this prominent and also who has a legacy of saying we're going to follow
[03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:11.880]  the constitution we're going to follow the laws as written it's a very good point you bring that
[03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:18.280]  that article up david was i was looking at myself just now yeah the son is saying that you know
[03:55:18.280 --> 03:55:22.760]  commonators like michael savage and alex jones concern his father's death or a hurtful distracted
[03:55:22.760 --> 03:55:27.880]  distraction to his legacy about the uh so-called conspiracy theories so who said the pillow was
[03:55:27.880 --> 03:55:32.520]  on the head yeah john poindex we didn't come up with that yeah here's my point yeah who said it
[03:55:32.520 --> 03:55:36.920]  was a heart attack we didn't say that either when you're a public official when you're a public
[03:55:36.920 --> 03:55:41.640]  official you're you're held to a different standard than a private citizen so yes the public is going
[03:55:41.640 --> 03:55:47.880]  to demand an autopsy because this could very well be an issue of national security a b also said uh
[03:55:47.880 --> 03:55:53.320]  laura integrand which said the speculation was the most stupidest ridiculous thing but if we had
[03:55:53.320 --> 03:55:57.800]  an autopsy there wouldn't be any speculation to begin with exactly that if you want to get you
[03:55:57.800 --> 03:56:01.800]  find a dead illegal alien in the field what are you going to do they get they automatically do an
[03:56:01.800 --> 03:56:05.400]  autopsy why can't we do this for a Supreme Court justice we can get we can get autopsies on illegal
[03:56:05.400 --> 03:56:11.560]  aliens but not a supreme court justice they don't have a problem with a uh a judge who is not there
[03:56:11.560 --> 03:56:15.800]  without any medical training speculating that it was a heart attack and yet they have trouble when
[03:56:15.800 --> 03:56:21.080]  uh we we talk about that but i want to get uh wane mattson's uh take on this wane what's your
[03:56:21.080 --> 03:56:25.720]  final take on this well i would note what caesar melendez said the man who was the former deputy
[03:56:25.720 --> 03:56:30.680]  sheriff down in persidio county who's running against the current incumbent who's been there for
[03:56:30.680 --> 03:56:37.400]  the mingas decades the mingas who botched this entire thing up uh former deputy melendez said
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:42.520]  anytime they would discover a body whether it was an unattended death in somebody's home or out in
[03:56:42.520 --> 03:56:49.800]  the field it was a migrant uh illegal migrant they they would treat it as a homicide until they ruled
[03:56:49.800 --> 03:56:54.360]  everything else out and and then and then they could determine whether it was an accidental
[03:56:54.360 --> 03:56:59.640]  conspiracy it's called a criminal investigation proper protocol he said all these procedures
[03:56:59.640 --> 03:57:06.760]  were violated in this case and uh you know there's there's a couple things with the son
[03:57:06.760 --> 03:57:14.360]  of scalia saying what he's saying either his father died uh an embarrassing death that they
[03:57:14.360 --> 03:57:19.960]  that the family doesn't didn't want the autopsy because it might reveal what was in his system
[03:57:19.960 --> 03:57:30.840]  as far as any sort of pharmaceuticals uh alcohol perhaps or um the the um the other thing is uh
[03:57:30.840 --> 03:57:37.160]  and this happens a lot in british intelligence when they target somebody uh they make it look
[03:57:37.160 --> 03:57:42.520]  like a suicide but it's not just that uh they murder the person make it look like a suicide
[03:57:42.520 --> 03:57:48.040]  usually they're found hanging then they put women's underwear on a man and then spread a bunch of
[03:57:48.040 --> 03:57:53.560]  pornography around the floor what happens is the family is so upset and so embarrassed they don't
[03:57:53.560 --> 03:57:58.200]  want any kind of investigation they'll go along with the official story they did that with a spy
[03:57:58.200 --> 03:58:01.560]  in the bag they did all that what you're talking about and then put him in the bag and people
[03:58:01.560 --> 03:58:05.880]  said well he committed suicide by putting himself in a bag it's like you gotta be crazy you can't
[03:58:05.880 --> 03:58:10.920]  possibly say that that happens all the time this is what happens a lot of autopsy a lot of
[03:58:10.920 --> 03:58:16.440]  questions about that well thank you so much wane madson kit daniels joe biggs that's it for today's
