[00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.182]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.182 --> 00:00:07.944]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:09.706]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:11.288]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:12.830]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.034]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:21.078]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:41.194]  Former head of his campaign and his confidant, Roger Stone, is going to be joining us from South Carolina, coming up in two minus 33 minutes from now.
[00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:48.602]  And the article that we wrote about his latest comments is at DrudgeReport.com right now, via InfoWars.com.
[00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:52.146]  Confidant Trump is always wearing a bulletproof vest.
[00:00:52.947 --> 00:00:57.112]  Now, he said that on this show, you know, five, six months ago.
[00:00:57.112 --> 00:01:01.216]  And he talked about how Trump carries a firearm pretty much all the time.
[00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:02.478]  And the press made a big deal with that.
[00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:08.825]  My gosh, a presidential frontrunner with all these death threats, and El Chapo saying he wants him dead, and ISIS saying they want him dead.
[00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:11.447]  And he has a bulletproof vest!
[00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:17.118]  That's almost as crazy as a cop wearing a bulletproof vest or an army soldier wearing a helmet.
[00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:20.481]  I mean, can you imagine how extreme and horrible he is?
[00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:24.644]  That's why the New York Daily News has labeled him the Antichrist.
[00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:31.148]  The Washington Post labeled yours truly the Universal Vector of Conspiracy Theories.
[00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:33.270]  Yesterday, I'm very, very honored to have that title.
[00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.552]  You mean the Universal Vector of Questioning?
[00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:39.627]  We have a giant broadcast line up today, so jam-packed with guests.
[00:01:39.627 --> 00:01:42.749]  I'll tell you all about it when we come into the main launch of the transmission.
[00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:47.912]  This is just that little kick-off portion, but the big exclusive article for Breitbart.
[00:01:47.912 --> 00:01:53.935]  Pat Buchanan says Donald Trump's rise is rejection of a quarter century of Bush Republicanism.
[00:01:53.935 --> 00:02:02.819]  And that's what we're seeing is the Rockefeller, Blue Blood, Democratic Party coup of the Democrats in deep, deep water right now.
[00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.000]  Deep boiling water.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:13.606]  And so it is bye-bye to that political dynasty of open borders, taking our guns, signing on to UN treaties, and more.
[00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:13.987]  The Pope!
[00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.011]  Has come out as a big fat hypocrite and said, open up your borders, let anybody come in that wants to.
[00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:21.252]  But he doesn't say that Italy should have to do that.
[00:02:21.252 --> 00:02:25.973]  And he's got 200 foot walls around the Vatican, the biggest in the world, the thickest in the world.
[00:02:25.973 --> 00:02:31.494]  And I've been saying this for six months about the Pope since I was in Italy, pointing it out.
[00:02:31.494 --> 00:02:32.494]  He'd already been to the U.S.
[00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:34.435]  calling for open borders and to Mexico.
[00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:35.435]  He's coming here all the time.
[00:02:35.435 --> 00:02:39.076]  He's so political, like no other Pope we've ever seen, and extremely globalist.
[00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:46.038]  And finally, Donald Trump picked up on it, sort of tweeting photos of the giant walls yesterday.
[00:02:46.038 --> 00:02:52.280]  So I thought we'd play a clip of myself yesterday talking about this, and then of course, Trump echoing that.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.800]  Here it is.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.561]  The Vatican has 200 plus foot walls.
[00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:58.561]  Can we put a photo up of that for TV viewers?
[00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:00.222]  Or just Google Vatican walls.
[00:03:00.222 --> 00:03:02.262]  Biggest, thickest in the world.
[00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:03.243]  You go in there, they shoot you.
[00:03:03.243 --> 00:03:05.283]  He hasn't taken one refugee in there.
[00:03:05.283 --> 00:03:06.463]  We are being flooded.
[00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:07.464]  We are being shot up.
[00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:08.264]  We are being attacked.
[00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:10.939]  We are a joke, the whole world.
[00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.399]  We have to pay for everybody's health care.
[00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:13.900]  We're going bankrupt.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.161]  They're taking old ladies' houses for back IRS taxes they can't pay.
[00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.662]  Whether they be black, white, Hispanic, who cries for them?
[00:03:20.662 --> 00:03:28.225]  And you sit there and you say, we're racist because we have the most open immigration system in the world?
[00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:33.987]  What a creepy old evil looking man, creeping around, socialist, dirtbag.
[00:03:33.987 --> 00:03:37.428]  Him and Bernie Sanders ought to marry each other.
[00:03:37.428 --> 00:03:38.929]  I mean, I am just sick of it.
[00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:42.159]  So Trump responded just moments ago.
[00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.280]  You know, honestly, the Vatican has massive walls around.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.041]  We should build some walls like the Vatican.
[00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:49.542]  So perhaps he wants to move out of the Vatican.
[00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:52.043]  But if you look at the walls around the Vatican, I've been there.
[00:03:52.043 --> 00:03:53.664]  And those are walls.
[00:03:54.824 --> 00:03:58.286]  Yeah, in fact, he's tweeting a whole bunch of pictures of those walls right now.
[00:03:58.286 --> 00:04:12.194]  Mr. Trump also saying, quote, it's disgraceful for the Pope to question his faith and warning upon it that, quote, if and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, everyone knows that ISIS's ultimate trophy is probably the Vatican.
[00:04:12.194 --> 00:04:17.917]  I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump were the president.
[00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:20.669]  So, there you go.
[00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.151]  And look, I got mad at the Pope yesterday and called him a dirtbag.
[00:04:23.151 --> 00:04:27.095]  And I should be respectful, not of him, but of people that are Catholics who are great people.
[00:04:27.095 --> 00:04:29.497]  Some of the best folks I've met.
[00:04:29.497 --> 00:04:30.858]  But he's not a Catholic.
[00:04:30.858 --> 00:04:32.079]  He's not a Christian in my view.
[00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:34.662]  And he's fair game for saying Donald Trump isn't a Christian.
[00:04:34.662 --> 00:04:37.324]  In his religious role, that's a big deal.
[00:04:37.324 --> 00:04:39.146]  And it's very insulting.
[00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:40.407]  It's very hypocritical.
[00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:44.070]  And he's gotten right in the political arena of our internal politics.
[00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.731]  And he's fair game.
[00:04:46.397 --> 00:04:47.038]  I'll just say this.
[00:04:47.038 --> 00:04:48.038]  I won't call him a dirtbag.
[00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:51.281]  I'll call him an America destroyer.
[00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:53.202]  He wants to kill this country.
[00:04:53.202 --> 00:04:54.544]  He wants world government.
[00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.105]  The Pope is an enemy of humanity.
[00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:03.560]  North Korea is planning a terrorist attack on South Korea.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:12.406]  This according to the National Intelligence Service that says North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, gave the order to begin preparations.
[00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:21.152]  The NIS warning covered a large number of possible targets, including subways, shopping malls, and even a nuclear power plant.
[00:05:21.152 --> 00:05:26.275]  All key lines of communication between North and South Korea have been cut off.
[00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:27.716]  I've long predicted in my world affairs
[00:05:27.796 --> 00:05:33.078]  Now as political scientist and author of Strategic Relocation, Joel Skousen, who says that a fight between North and South Korea might be a trigger event,
[00:05:47.904 --> 00:05:49.366]  To World War 3.
[00:05:49.366 --> 00:05:50.327]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:53.652]  forces in the region are making their presence known.
[00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:58.698]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:58.698 --> 00:06:05.067]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:06:05.507 --> 00:06:08.691]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:14.397]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.
[00:06:14.397 --> 00:06:15.158]  I needed a detox, basically.
[00:06:29.274 --> 00:06:32.938]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[00:06:32.938 --> 00:06:34.240]  What do you have to lose?
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:42.809]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:46.835]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[00:06:46.835 --> 00:06:48.918]  I was like really more natural.
[00:06:48.918 --> 00:06:53.945]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:06:58.621 --> 00:07:02.123]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[00:07:02.123 --> 00:07:07.707]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:07:07.707 --> 00:07:16.092]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:07:16.092 --> 00:07:21.736]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:07:22.236 --> 00:07:31.299]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:37.521]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:44.283]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:07:44.283 --> 00:07:49.325]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:52.106]  Now available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:07:52.106 --> 00:08:10.136]  That's InfoWarsLive.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:10.136 --> 00:08:17.860]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.813 --> 00:08:28.058]  Pope Francis has come out yesterday, it's a big deal, obviously, and said that Donald Trump is not a Christian.
[00:08:28.058 --> 00:08:34.783]  And I guess if Trump was a Catholic, like some of his family is, he could be excommunicated.
[00:08:34.783 --> 00:08:47.251]  I guess that means sent to hell by the socialist, fake populist pope, who has more in kin with Joseph Stalin and Bernie Sanders than with his predecessors.
[00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:55.020]  There's a very powerful report I'm about to premiere here and then we're going to post it on InfoWars.com and Facebook and Twitter.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.222]  I hope people will get this video out to everybody.
[00:08:57.222 --> 00:09:00.885]  It's titled, Pope vs. Trump.
[00:09:00.885 --> 00:09:03.327]  We're going to play it in a moment.
[00:09:03.327 --> 00:09:09.011]  And then we have Trump confidant and former campaign head, Roger Stone, joining us.
[00:09:09.011 --> 00:09:12.734]  His story is at the top of DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:09:12.734 --> 00:09:16.157]  Confidant, Trump is always wearing a bulletproof vest.
[00:09:16.157 --> 00:09:18.159]  And the media makes a big deal out of that.
[00:09:20.077 --> 00:09:27.923]  Kind of like when Stone talked about how Trump carries a firearm and Trump was asked about it and said, yeah, I do sometimes.
[00:09:27.923 --> 00:09:29.164]  Not going to tell you when.
[00:09:29.164 --> 00:09:33.407]  Well, it's all the time.
[00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:36.729]  And they made a controversy and saying it's incredible he carries a gun.
[00:09:36.729 --> 00:09:38.991]  See how radical he is.
[00:09:38.991 --> 00:09:45.796]  As if a public figure worth billions of dollars having a right to defend themselves is alien or strange.
[00:09:45.796 --> 00:09:46.957]  Ronald Reagan carried a gun.
[00:09:47.912 --> 00:09:50.453]  But that's how disconnected they hope you are.
[00:09:50.453 --> 00:09:54.133]  A police officer carries a gun, wears a bulletproof vest.
[00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:56.234]  I'd say they're in a lot less danger, and they're in danger.
[00:09:56.234 --> 00:10:05.836]  But they're in a lot less danger than the Republican frontrunner with all these haters and all these giant town halls and open events without screening, basically, or limited screening.
[00:10:05.836 --> 00:10:11.217]  He's probably one of the most in-danger people in America, or in the world.
[00:10:11.217 --> 00:10:12.277]  And they act like it's weird.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.801]  That he, where's the bulletproof vest?
[00:10:14.801 --> 00:10:16.903]  They say, why doesn't he button his coat?
[00:10:16.903 --> 00:10:18.645]  Well, what's he fat?
[00:10:18.645 --> 00:10:25.751]  No, you can see the bulletproof vest.
[00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:27.994]  And I'm going to just leave it at that.
[00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:31.597]  He's got other security measures that I've been told about.
[00:10:35.117 --> 00:10:47.421]  And it just shows how they have this idea that Hollywood can have bodyguards, presidents can have bodyguards, Supreme Court justices can have them, but citizens, even when they're a frontrunner, it's bad.
[00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:50.281]  That is the disconnect.
[00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:54.963]  Also coming up, I haven't gotten into the whole Black Lives Matter movement in the last few months because
[00:10:55.683 --> 00:11:05.790]  Quite frankly, I'm really sick of watching these people and really sick of seeing what they're peddling and these rappers meeting at the White House and Obama meeting at the White House with the leaders of Black Lives Matter.
[00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.391]  I'm against police brutality.
[00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:14.856]  I'm against, in some cases, profiling and obvious persecution of black people being singled out.
[00:11:14.856 --> 00:11:23.662]  But if you look at the statistics and the numbers in the aggregate and the numbers of deaths, it is one of the least dangerous trends for black people in this country.
[00:11:26.523 --> 00:11:30.025]  Maximum, a couple hundred black people a year shot by police.
[00:11:30.025 --> 00:11:33.607]  And in most cases it's justified, but let's just say none of it's justified.
[00:11:33.607 --> 00:11:36.128]  Is that the number one issue facing black America?
[00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:41.131]  Double unemployment, Planned Parenthood targeting you, killing 52% of your people.
[00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:43.672]  Is something killing millions of people a year big?
[00:11:43.672 --> 00:11:44.833]  Or is a couple hundred big?
[00:11:44.833 --> 00:11:47.575]  I mean, see, I just use logic, folks.
[00:11:47.575 --> 00:11:52.217]  And then I ask, who is behind the Black Lives Matter movement?
[00:11:52.217 --> 00:11:53.698]  The White House, Soros.
[00:11:53.698 --> 00:11:55.239]  He found differences between Catholic
[00:11:56.369 --> 00:12:04.336]  And Orthodox in Ukraine got them all to kill each other, overthrew an elected government, now the country is in decline.
[00:12:04.336 --> 00:12:12.904]  They go in and find Sunni versus Shiite, they exacerbate the differences there, overthrow the countries, and then basically come in and take them over.
[00:12:12.904 --> 00:12:21.291]  And they come here and they bring in giant Hispanic populations, fill them full of socialist hatred, full of racial vitriol in many cases at the universities,
[00:12:22.452 --> 00:12:25.374]  And then turn them into chip-on-the-shoulder political bodies.
[00:12:25.374 --> 00:12:35.962]  Well, they haven't been as effective as doing that with black folks, and black folks really did have something they could, you know, say was terrible and horrible and long-term that happened to them that was systemic.
[00:12:35.962 --> 00:12:51.354]  But it's such mind control, and I'll talk about this some today, to watch this where Kanye West and Jay-Z and 50 Cent and all these people are just constantly going and stirring stuff up, constantly going around like that's their street cred
[00:12:52.489 --> 00:13:00.534]  To sell tickets, and then complaining, I only made 50 million last year, Kanye said, I need more money.
[00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:03.156]  Actually said that.
[00:13:03.156 --> 00:13:04.556]  It's a joke.
[00:13:04.556 --> 00:13:21.047]  You've got these filthy rich people running around, complaining about all this stuff, and it's government directed to get us all in each other's throat, and clearly they're heating it back up ahead of the election, just like when the radical Muslims didn't get elected in Kenya, he told his cousin Odinga, go ahead and have riots in his, you know, Senate letter.
[00:13:21.627 --> 00:13:24.049]  They'll make you a government position, and they did.
[00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:25.610]  So they're looking to disrupt this election.
[00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:31.134]  They're looking for some big distractions to bring in civil emergencies where he can appoint a Supreme Court justice.
[00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:34.336]  There's a lot of stuff going on, a lot of hanky-panky right now.
[00:13:36.604 --> 00:13:41.827]  So Miami Police Union votes to boycott Beyonce concert.
[00:13:41.827 --> 00:13:45.029]  Police Union and other cities considering similar action.
[00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:51.232]  But the bigger issue is why at the Super Bowl would you see all this being pushed?
[00:13:51.232 --> 00:13:55.395]  Like the gun control, like the anti-family stuff, like the anti-father garbage.
[00:13:55.395 --> 00:13:59.137]  And you know Doritos has a pro-fetus ad and Planned Parenthood complaints.
[00:14:01.198 --> 00:14:02.899]  And the feminist complaint.
[00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:04.359]  It's all an agenda.
[00:14:04.359 --> 00:14:06.940]  The agenda isn't coming from Beyonce and Kanye.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.822]  They're just the front people that do what they're told by Hollywood.
[00:14:10.822 --> 00:14:17.465]  It's the establishment doing this, and the police need to start pointing to that if you really want to change the country.
[00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:18.945]  Sure, nice start.
[00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:28.289]  Don't supply security to these folks if they want to sit there and say that you deserve to basically be killed.
[00:14:28.289 --> 00:14:29.330]  Because that's what they do.
[00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:35.798]  Now, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes, but I want to start going to this John Bowne report.

[00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.695]  Now, let's go ahead and go to this powerful report from John Bowne, Pope versus Trump.
[00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:57.496]  Here it is.
[00:15:08.516 --> 00:15:12.198]  We have scored a direct stab in those sons of bitches hearts!
[00:15:12.198 --> 00:15:14.239]  We gotta keep running the knife in though, folks.
[00:15:14.239 --> 00:15:16.721]  We gotta keep running it in there, not worry what they're doing to us.
[00:15:16.721 --> 00:15:18.081]  You wanted to fight?
[00:15:18.081 --> 00:15:19.102]  You're getting it!
[00:15:19.102 --> 00:15:23.104]  You wanted to overrun us and poison us and take our families and kill us?
[00:15:23.104 --> 00:15:24.905]  You will die!
[00:15:24.905 --> 00:15:26.066]  Not us!
[00:15:26.066 --> 00:15:28.627]  Choose which side you're on in the government and the military.
[00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:30.628]  And worldwide, choose which side you're on.
[00:15:30.628 --> 00:15:33.130]  The age of cowardice is coming to an end.
[00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.231]  The age of men will return.
[00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:50.698]  Would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
[00:15:55.043 --> 00:15:56.684]  The time is now.
[00:15:56.684 --> 00:15:59.246]  The age of the Patriot is peaking.
[00:15:59.246 --> 00:16:04.689]  America wouldn't even exist if not for the sacrifice of millions of unknown soldiers.
[00:16:04.689 --> 00:16:15.917]  George Washington himself, battling severe dysentery, crawled on his hands and knees in the dark to defend this great experiment known as the United States of America.
[00:16:16.317 --> 00:16:28.446]  Now there is an open media battle waging between the New World Order's Pope Francis and the awakening realization of complete tyranny with a bullseye sighted on millions of Americans.
[00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:32.548]  Caught in the crosshairs, presidential candidate Donald J. Trump.
[00:16:32.548 --> 00:16:34.310]  And Trump isn't backing down.
[00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:46.938]  Steve Watson writes, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump has promised to make public currently guarded secrets surrounding the 9-11 attacks should he be elected president.
[00:16:46.938 --> 00:16:57.666]  Speaking at a campaign event in Bluffton, South Carolina, Trump continued his onslaught on the Bush presidency by once again raising the issue of the attack on the World Trade Center on 9-11, 2001.
[00:16:59.767 --> 00:17:01.309]  We went after Iraq.
[00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:02.631]  We decimated the country.
[00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:03.592]  Iran's taken over.
[00:17:03.592 --> 00:17:04.193]  Okay.
[00:17:04.193 --> 00:17:06.616]  But it wasn't the Iraqis.
[00:17:06.616 --> 00:17:11.582]  You will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center, because they have papers in there that are very secret.
[00:17:11.582 --> 00:17:13.685]  You may find it's the Saudis.
[00:17:13.685 --> 00:17:14.486]  Okay?
[00:17:14.486 --> 00:17:15.587]  But you will find out.
[00:17:15.587 --> 00:17:16.168]  But it wasn't Iraq.
[00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:28.332]  Trump was referring to the 28 pages of the original Joint Congressional Inquiry into 9-11, which remain classified and withheld from the public on grounds of national security.
[00:17:28.332 --> 00:17:37.456]  The pages are already known to implicate the Saudi royal family in financing the supposed hijackers in the United States prior to the attacks.
[00:17:37.896 --> 00:17:51.720]  Speaking at a press conference regarding the missing pages in 2014, Kentucky Representative Thomas Massey lobbied for the release of the documents stating he read them and that they challenged him to reconsider everything he knew about the event.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:18:02.963]  I had to stop every couple pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange my understanding of history for the past 13 years and years leading up to that.
[00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:06.945]  It challenges you to rethink everything.
[00:18:06.945 --> 00:18:11.347]  And so I think the whole country needs to go through that.
[00:18:11.347 --> 00:18:13.888]  It's going to be difficult and could be embarrassing.
[00:18:13.888 --> 00:18:17.550]  But that is no reason to keep the truth of the American people.
[00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:31.036]  Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Jeb Bush on the campaign trail and at debates by raising the issue of 9-11 and the intelligence warnings that were provided to the Bush administration and subsequently ignored.
[00:18:31.876 --> 00:18:35.978]  Jeb Bush has avoided the issue and even mocked those who raise it.
[00:18:35.978 --> 00:18:40.280]  Would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 commission report?
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.561]  Would you be one to see those released?
[00:18:41.561 --> 00:18:43.962]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:18:43.962 --> 00:18:44.282]  Go.
[00:18:44.282 --> 00:18:46.203]  Well, hopefully we can get them.
[00:18:46.203 --> 00:18:52.186]  My son's dead and I don't know all the facts.
[00:18:52.186 --> 00:18:53.066]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:53.727]  Go.
[00:18:53.727 --> 00:18:58.129]  Keeping it a secret about those who facilitated it must end now.
[00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:07.275]  Trump's comments have prompted establishment Republicans and conservative talking heads to label him a 9-11 truther and a radical kook.
[00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:09.756]  His enemies are coming out of the woodwork.
[00:19:09.756 --> 00:19:23.185]  Fresh on the heels of a big Catholic no-no by legitimizing contraception as a lesser evil in the face of the World Health Organization's nefarious Zika virus rollout, Pope Francis is weighing into the U.S.
[00:19:23.185 --> 00:19:27.008]  presidential election saying Donald Trump is not Christian.
[00:19:27.368 --> 00:19:33.152]  ABC News reports, when asked by a reporter, can a good Catholic vote for this man?
[00:19:33.152 --> 00:19:41.797]  Francis responded by saying, a person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be and not building bridges is not Christian.
[00:19:41.797 --> 00:19:51.043]  The Pope is the spokesman for the decimation of the world's cultures by what in Europe is clearly either a horrendous mistake or a deliberate action.
[00:19:51.363 --> 00:19:59.707]  Pope Francis broke new ground when he unleashed his temper on adoring Catholics after stumbling from giving a hug to a disabled person in a wheelchair.
[00:19:59.707 --> 00:20:03.668]  The Pope is losing his temper on his followers for a reason.
[00:20:03.668 --> 00:20:11.612]  Because Pope Francis knows a new world order is right around the corner and he doesn't need his followers anymore.
[00:20:11.612 --> 00:20:13.553]  John Barron for InfoWars.com
[00:20:16.914 --> 00:20:18.074]  A powerful transmission.
[00:20:18.074 --> 00:20:24.736]  We're going to have that posted to Infowars.com right now.
[00:20:24.736 --> 00:20:29.517]  And we need everybody to get the video out to their friends and family and neighbors.
[00:20:29.517 --> 00:20:31.557]  This is a war.
[00:20:31.557 --> 00:20:41.940]  And the reason I get even more animated and more aggressive and more focused is that people need to be broken out of their trance and realize that this isn't a game.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.020]  This is for all the marbles.
[00:20:44.139 --> 00:20:55.942]  And the social engineers that run the planetary government don't want to just run us, don't want to just conquer us because they think they can manage things better.
[00:20:55.942 --> 00:21:07.265]  They are fundamentally anti-human and want to break the human cycle forever because it overthrows monopolies with innovation.
[00:21:07.265 --> 00:21:12.707]  They are fundamentally in competition with free will and the human spirit.
[00:21:12.707 --> 00:21:13.147]  Period!
[00:21:16.226 --> 00:21:27.069]  Those that survive under the technotronic era will live in a form of undeadness.
[00:21:27.069 --> 00:21:45.095]  You'll still have blood coursing through your veins, but you will not be human, and from birth, you will be shuttered in to a false reality and programmed, where there is no language authorized but the daily download, and where you become nothing more but a biological robot.
[00:21:46.218 --> 00:21:48.279]  An Android.
[00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:50.280]  A Replica.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.723]  A Nexus 6.
[00:21:55.723 --> 00:21:57.564]  And I've got stacks of news articles here today.
[00:21:57.564 --> 00:22:02.406]  Several of them are big liberal tech people and others saying, I'm sick of seeing homeless.
[00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:03.327]  Clean them out the street.
[00:22:03.327 --> 00:22:06.168]  They're disgusting.
[00:22:06.168 --> 00:22:10.450]  Wait till there's a hundred million homeless people and not five million.
[00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.371]  They're going to eat you alive.
[00:22:12.371 --> 00:22:14.573]  You fools thought you could
[00:22:15.632 --> 00:22:20.915]  Rob everybody and build an anti-capitalist system and then scapegoat capitalism?
[00:22:20.915 --> 00:22:26.919]  And you think socialism will just pacify people when the means of production is destroyed?
[00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:31.302]  Hollande is coming out saying, sorry, you can't work 35 hours anymore a week.
[00:22:31.302 --> 00:22:32.782]  Sorry, we gotta cut your vacation.
[00:22:32.782 --> 00:22:36.385]  Sorry, we're taking your pension funds.
[00:22:36.385 --> 00:22:40.127]  The French that got domesticated and thought socialism was so great and are now so spoiled?
[00:22:42.563 --> 00:22:45.204]  You are about to be completely gutted.
[00:22:45.204 --> 00:22:48.266]  And that's what happens once socialism goes into its final phases.
[00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:56.050]  Then it collapses and either fascism or communism comes in, which are basically the same thing.
[00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:02.274]  With communism, they just have a fascist group that's above the law of oligarchs, and they call it communist.
[00:23:03.456 --> 00:23:07.239]  But really, it's just fascism using communism as a management model.
[00:23:07.239 --> 00:23:13.786]  And by the way, those of you that went to political science and read books on it, you go, that's not true, they're completely different.
[00:23:13.786 --> 00:23:18.350]  I've read Benito Mussolini's writings and Hitler's writings, Mein Kampf and more.
[00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.332]  I've read Das Kapital.
[00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:24.876]  I've read the complete Communist Manifesto probably ten times.
[00:23:24.876 --> 00:23:26.938]  And the political ideas I have coined
[00:23:29.235 --> 00:23:32.456]  And my perspective has invaded the body politic.
[00:23:32.456 --> 00:23:40.838]  We're not going to be interviewing some news reporter from the Netherlands and she's quoting me about the left-right paradigm and dichotomy and how it's false and has no idea even who I am.
[00:23:40.838 --> 00:23:43.079]  She's repeating something I coined 20 years ago.
[00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:46.680]  That is success, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.121]  When you hear people all over using your terms and you don't even make a comment, you just go, oh, really?
[00:23:51.121 --> 00:23:51.561]  Interesting.
[00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:53.102]  Thank you for that information.
[00:23:55.157 --> 00:24:06.000]  I don't go to some vomitarian college and have them fill me full of Jacobin propaganda.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.181]  And then come back and regurgitate it like I'm smart.
[00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:11.681]  I've read your founding father Plato.
[00:24:11.681 --> 00:24:13.922]  Three of his books.
[00:24:13.922 --> 00:24:16.183]  The Republic three times.
[00:24:16.183 --> 00:24:20.284]  I first read The Republic when I was ten years old.
[00:24:20.284 --> 00:24:20.784]  Or tried to.
[00:24:26.553 --> 00:24:31.536]  And if you guys want to know where you're coming from, you need to go read it.
[00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:43.642]  If you want to know who the dominant philosopher is of the world, who wrote the book on the eugenicist 2,300 years later?
[00:24:43.642 --> 00:24:52.707]  If you want to know where Hitler got it all, if you want to know where David Rockefeller got it all, if you want to know where Zbigniew Brzezinski comes from, if you want to know where George Soros comes from, if you want to know where V.I.
[00:24:52.707 --> 00:24:53.548]  Lenin comes from,
[00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:01.545]  You have to know about Plato.
[00:25:01.545 --> 00:25:04.988]  He didn't use terms like liberal and conservative.
[00:25:04.988 --> 00:25:08.410]  He didn't use terms like communist and fascist.
[00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:17.557]  He used terms like ruling elite and cattle.
[00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:21.060]  And if you want to be cattle, that's your decision.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.821]  I and mine are not going to be.
[00:25:27.711 --> 00:25:34.695]  They think they've got it all figured out.
[00:25:34.695 --> 00:25:49.364]  But with the return of man, with the return of people that want to actually build a community, and actually want to be honorable, and actually like to see success, and like to be challenged, and like to be defeated by someone that's better.
[00:25:50.926 --> 00:25:58.729]  Because we're all about the species, we're all about human empowerment, we're all about renaissance, with the return of light coming back into the world.
[00:25:58.729 --> 00:26:03.831]  Not the false light, but the true light.
[00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:10.114]  With that coming back into the world, you are in deep trouble and you know it.
[00:26:10.114 --> 00:26:15.676]  The false prophets of this system are fraud.
[00:26:15.676 --> 00:26:18.397]  And they're not going to fall because they already fell.
[00:26:19.795 --> 00:26:26.941]  And that's why they want to drag us along with them into their profane rattles.
[00:26:26.941 --> 00:26:29.924]  And we're not going to do it.
[00:26:29.924 --> 00:26:48.059]  Because those of us that are awake and are tuned in, not to your false paradigm, but into the universe, into the mind of God, understand that this is nothing but a test and nothing but an animating contest.
[00:26:51.144 --> 00:26:53.846]  So you are defeated?
[00:26:53.846 --> 00:27:05.794]  Your top generals, your top captains, your top field marshals, your top wizards, know that.
[00:27:05.794 --> 00:27:14.941]  And they believe, taking a big chunk of humanity with them into the pit, that somehow they're going to build a new reality.
[00:27:15.882 --> 00:27:31.267]  We've seen the realities you build with the power you've had on this earth, and you build slums, and ignorance, and hate, and division, and ugliness, and poverty.
[00:27:31.267 --> 00:27:35.748]  Bernie Sanders is a Nosferatu.
[00:27:35.748 --> 00:27:40.750]  Hillary Clinton is a blood-drinking witch, politically.
[00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:41.390]  Metaphysically.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:52.966]  These Republican leaders are a bunch of narcissistic, social-climbing, twit cowards.
[00:27:52.966 --> 00:27:55.008]  And they hate you and your family.
[00:27:55.008 --> 00:27:58.871]  They think they're better than you and they think you're stupid.
[00:27:58.871 --> 00:28:01.373]  Because they hate themselves.
[00:28:01.373 --> 00:28:06.837]  They project it onto you, and they've had some pretty good success turning us into a bunch of mutants.
[00:28:06.837 --> 00:28:12.922]  But I'll take the mutant population that's been under chemical and bio attack for a hundred years any day over your scum.
[00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.732]  And God works in mysterious ways.
[00:28:17.732 --> 00:28:25.138]  Now before I end this segment is key, before we come back with Mr. Stone, Trump Insider with a bunch of breaking intel and more.
[00:28:25.138 --> 00:28:29.802]  We rarely have to pull a special before it's due date.
[00:28:29.802 --> 00:28:39.510]  We tend to extend specials when supplies last of the nutraceuticals that are just so high quality that people just love them and it's helped us fund this operation.
[00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.231]  It's through Providence.
[00:28:41.809 --> 00:28:43.610]  I have to pull the Supermail special right now.
[00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:44.690]  It's been pulled an hour ago.
[00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.690]  20% off.
[00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.332]  It's pulled because it'll sell out within a day at the current sales rates.
[00:28:49.332 --> 00:28:50.032]  We're not getting more.
[00:28:50.032 --> 00:28:52.012]  It looks like for a month.
[00:28:52.012 --> 00:28:53.453]  That is a big problem.
[00:28:53.453 --> 00:28:54.353]  I miscalculated.
[00:28:54.353 --> 00:28:56.154]  The special was too popular.
[00:28:56.154 --> 00:28:59.255]  And so I'm pulling it because we've got to have enough for auto ship.
[00:28:59.255 --> 00:29:02.416]  If you sign up for auto ship, you get 10% off and get it guaranteed.
[00:29:04.264 --> 00:29:16.754]  So basically, if you sign up for AutoShip now, for whatever products you want, it's specific, you can cancel any time, you get guaranteed 10% off, and you always get what you want, because we now hold back the number of people that we have sign up for AutoShip, and then some.
[00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:20.557]  So that's another reason, info or store.com, to sign up for that.
[00:29:20.557 --> 00:29:24.200]  But Super Female Vitality works just as good in men, in my experience.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.202]  Some people like it better, some not as much.
[00:29:26.202 --> 00:29:28.484]  Super Female, we've got plenty of that.
[00:29:28.484 --> 00:29:29.705]  So that's still 20% off.
[00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:32.267]  Super Male is back to the regular price, and is about to sell out.
[00:29:32.887 --> 00:29:38.713]  Unless you sign up for AutoShip and AndroPlex, it will be selling out within hours, except for what we hold back for AutoShip as well.
[00:29:38.713 --> 00:29:41.496]  Thank you all for your support, but really, these are game-changing products.
[00:29:41.496 --> 00:29:43.318]  You owe it to yourself to try them.
[00:29:43.318 --> 00:29:48.064]  Libido, Energy Stamina, Infowarslife.com, a bunch of other great products as well.
[00:29:48.064 --> 00:29:49.465]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.465 --> 00:29:52.008]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.008 --> 00:29:54.691]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.809 --> 00:30:04.491]  A tech exec is outraged at having to see homeless riffraff and he warns of a revolution.
[00:30:04.491 --> 00:30:11.494]  In an open letter to San Francisco's mayor, tech entrepreneur Justin Keller asks, what are you going to do to address this problem?
[00:30:11.494 --> 00:30:20.798]  He describes some of his unfortunate encounters with the homeless riffraff on the streets who disturb his ability to enjoy the trendy upscale San Francisco neighborhoods.
[00:30:20.798 --> 00:30:27.981]  He bemoans the fact that wealthy workers have to witness the pain, struggle, and despair of the homeless people on their daily commute.
[00:30:29.061 --> 00:30:31.862]  He then warns there's going to be a revolution.
[00:30:31.862 --> 00:30:39.183]  Indeed, darlings like Keller, enriched by the latest speculative tech bubble, are completely oblivious to the coming financial tsunami.
[00:30:39.183 --> 00:30:46.645]  Bubble economics is responsible for the success Keller enjoys, but as the economy falters, that source of financing will inevitably dry up.
[00:30:46.645 --> 00:30:56.267]  The speculative.com bubble crash of the late 1990s is set for a repeat, and the Justin Kellers of the world have no idea just how close to homeless they really are.
[00:30:56.267 --> 00:30:57.887]  Read more at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:58.601 --> 00:31:04.348]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:31:04.348 --> 00:31:18.805]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.

[00:31:57.626 --> 00:31:59.227]  Hey, everyone.
[00:31:59.227 --> 00:32:01.528]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:32:01.528 --> 00:32:05.369]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:32:05.369 --> 00:32:07.430]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.931]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per
[00:32:11.332 --> 00:32:13.173]  Man, woman and child in this country.
[00:32:13.173 --> 00:32:17.717]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:32:17.717 --> 00:32:24.161]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:32:24.161 --> 00:32:38.592]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats
[00:32:38.712 --> 00:32:38.912]  Thank you.
[00:33:07.996 --> 00:33:12.617]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:12.617 --> 00:33:17.238]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.042 --> 00:33:41.403]  There is so much going on and so much happening.
[00:33:41.403 --> 00:33:43.944]  It is information overload.
[00:33:43.944 --> 00:33:49.246]  The White House is trying to kick race riots and attacks on police into high gear.
[00:33:49.246 --> 00:33:51.587]  Yet again, a new big push is going.
[00:33:51.587 --> 00:33:53.708]  The police are pushing back against that.
[00:33:53.708 --> 00:34:00.570]  China has announced officially that they're set to ban all foreign media from publishing online inside China.
[00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:04.271]  And Zuckerberg and others have met with the Chinese censors to try to do that here.
[00:34:04.271 --> 00:34:07.713]  That shows China is getting ready to go belly up in a gigantor way.
[00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:10.154]  This is wild.
[00:34:10.154 --> 00:34:16.397]  They want to wait for the total collapse until after the election so they can blame a Republican or whoever else gets in there.
[00:34:16.397 --> 00:34:18.318]  I don't see that working.
[00:34:18.318 --> 00:34:25.201]  Pat Buchanan has come out and said that Donald Trump's rise is rejection of a quarter century of Bush Republican domination.
[00:34:25.201 --> 00:34:27.342]  Rockefeller Republican garbage.
[00:34:27.342 --> 00:34:31.444]  And the man who worked for Reagan and Nixon and the Bushes as well,
[00:34:32.344 --> 00:34:34.925]  For years, he's been valiantly exposing them.
[00:34:34.925 --> 00:34:36.946]  That's why I have so much respect for him.
[00:34:36.946 --> 00:34:40.187]  Jeb and the Bush crime family, he'll be in studio with us next week.
[00:34:40.187 --> 00:34:41.188]  We are selling the book.
[00:34:41.188 --> 00:34:43.308]  It's available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:34:43.308 --> 00:34:46.630]  This is Bookends with the Clinton's War on Women that we also sell.
[00:34:49.225 --> 00:34:53.886]  You want to act quick on both of these because it took us a month to get this because it sold out its first run.
[00:34:53.886 --> 00:34:55.626]  The new Jeb Bush book is out.
[00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:56.486]  The Bush crime family.
[00:34:56.486 --> 00:34:57.807]  This is CIA drug dealing.
[00:34:57.807 --> 00:34:58.567]  You name it.
[00:34:58.567 --> 00:35:00.587]  I mean, this is hard core.
[00:35:00.587 --> 00:35:01.547]  This is hard core.
[00:35:01.547 --> 00:35:03.448]  And this is the guy advising Donald Trump.
[00:35:03.448 --> 00:35:04.748]  You notice what he talks about on the show.
[00:35:04.748 --> 00:35:07.928]  You later hear Trump talking about he's formerly the head of the campaign.
[00:35:07.928 --> 00:35:11.129]  He resigned off the campaign six months ago or so.
[00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:14.370]  So he could go big guns and say whatever he wanted.
[00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.630]  But I tell you, you notice Trump comes out with
[00:35:17.881 --> 00:35:19.182]  The facts of the 28 pages.
[00:35:19.182 --> 00:35:23.285]  I've had Congress people, Senators on that have seen it.
[00:35:23.285 --> 00:35:25.227]  An order to stand down on 9-11.
[00:35:25.227 --> 00:35:28.690]  An order for the FBI not to stop the hijackers because they were Saudi.
[00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.511]  Blaming Iraq.
[00:35:30.511 --> 00:35:31.392]  Donald Trump comes out.
[00:35:31.392 --> 00:35:32.012]  He talks about it.
[00:35:32.012 --> 00:35:32.793]  They all demonize him.
[00:35:32.793 --> 00:35:34.174]  They stage booze.
[00:35:34.174 --> 00:35:35.175]  His approval rating goes up.
[00:35:36.796 --> 00:35:39.957]  And then he talks about the secret pages they make fun of and say it doesn't exist.
[00:35:39.957 --> 00:35:42.118]  Now the media is having to admit it does exist.
[00:35:42.118 --> 00:35:49.160]  Trump has gone from somebody that I admire and support as obviously better than Hillary and Sanders and these other Republicans to the real deal 100%.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:56.963]  And I think back to Stone, you know, a decade ago at JFK a bench and writing best-selling books on the government killing JFK.
[00:35:56.963 --> 00:35:58.704]  I mean, we're not conspiracy theorists.
[00:35:58.704 --> 00:35:59.224]  It's fact.
[00:36:00.205 --> 00:36:07.028]  And so, the Washington Post called me the universal vector of conspiracy theory on Scalia, and said that I said Obama strangled him.
[00:36:07.028 --> 00:36:07.688]  I didn't say that.
[00:36:07.688 --> 00:36:10.389]  I said, if they don't have an autopsy, it's suspicious.
[00:36:10.389 --> 00:36:12.670]  Saturday, the next day they announced it.
[00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:19.533]  And they kept changing the story, and then he's out there at this weird ranch of Democrats, and there's a pillow over his head, and all I said is, have an autopsy.
[00:36:19.533 --> 00:36:21.614]  And all these detectives have come out and said that.
[00:36:21.614 --> 00:36:23.295]  And Trump came out and said it, and he got attacked.
[00:36:23.295 --> 00:36:24.695]  And now the Pope's attacked him.
[00:36:24.695 --> 00:36:26.316]  I'm gonna stop ranting, because we've only got him.
[00:36:27.423 --> 00:36:31.384]  Until the end of the hour and he's going to be obviously on the ground this weekend out in South Carolina.
[00:36:31.384 --> 00:36:32.184]  Richard Reeves is there.
[00:36:32.184 --> 00:36:33.925]  We're going to have interviews with him again this weekend.
[00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:35.725]  We're going to be following this key battle.
[00:36:35.725 --> 00:36:39.587]  So we're going to talk about how is Trump really doing in his expert view.
[00:36:39.587 --> 00:36:45.068]  And then we're going to talk about each of these issues and an article that we wrote today that's on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:36:45.068 --> 00:36:47.729]  Confidant, Trump is always wearing a bulletproof vest.
[00:36:47.729 --> 00:36:50.390]  Ominous answer to why Donald never buttons up his jacket.
[00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:59.353]  In the four minutes I just talked, that's the field of points I'd like him to cover, and you can tackle any of those you want.
[00:36:59.353 --> 00:37:03.434]  I mean, the Pope versus Trump, lying about it, when he's got 200 foot walls.
[00:37:03.434 --> 00:37:07.835]  Trump basically quoting me, I've been hammering that for six months, these 200 foot walls.
[00:37:07.835 --> 00:37:09.376]  Very exciting on that front.
[00:37:09.376 --> 00:37:12.357]  He's just blowing this socialist Pope away.
[00:37:12.357 --> 00:37:13.597]  This is amazing.
[00:37:13.597 --> 00:37:14.838]  Where do you want to start, Mr. Stone?
[00:37:15.818 --> 00:37:16.959]  Alex, totally up to you.
[00:37:16.959 --> 00:37:24.804]  You've got a lot of ground to cover there, but it's an exciting time to be an American, because I really think we're on the cusp of taking our country back.
[00:37:24.804 --> 00:37:32.810]  Because of patriots like you, because of patriots like Donald Trump, they can call us conspiracy theorists, as you know that's a way to try to discredit us.
[00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.070]  All we are is truth tellers.
[00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.811]  We speak from the heart, like Donald Trump.
[00:37:36.811 --> 00:37:39.992]  We speak from the heart and let the chips fall where they may.
[00:37:39.992 --> 00:37:43.513]  So he's blowing the whistle on the globalists.
[00:37:43.513 --> 00:37:46.753]  This is a rejection of 30 years of Bushism.
[00:37:46.753 --> 00:37:48.594]  They've destroyed our economy.
[00:37:48.594 --> 00:37:51.074]  They've given us terrible trade policies.
[00:37:51.074 --> 00:37:53.395]  They've opened our borders to criminals.
[00:37:53.395 --> 00:37:55.216]  And now the chickens are coming home to roost.
[00:37:55.216 --> 00:37:56.716]  Pat Buchanan's absolutely right.
[00:37:58.208 --> 00:37:59.609]  They have sold us out.
[00:37:59.609 --> 00:38:01.231]  People know they're traitors.
[00:38:01.231 --> 00:38:03.053]  They're out of bullets.
[00:38:03.053 --> 00:38:09.899]  What do you expect them to do, though, as Hillary now, if she says anything bad about Sanders, everybody boos her.
[00:38:09.899 --> 00:38:11.561]  She's now behind.
[00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:12.842]  Trump is ahead of her in polls.
[00:38:12.842 --> 00:38:14.644]  The Republicans should just get behind him.
[00:38:14.644 --> 00:38:15.685]  He's the nominee.
[00:38:15.685 --> 00:38:16.245]  It's over.
[00:38:16.245 --> 00:38:18.968]  I don't trust any of these other guys now with the stuff they've done.
[00:38:18.968 --> 00:38:19.749]  I'm just going to be honest.
[00:38:19.749 --> 00:38:20.910]  I'm not being nasty.
[00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.351]  I'm Trump or bust.
[00:38:22.351 --> 00:38:22.732]  That's it.
[00:38:24.039 --> 00:38:26.541]  Yeah, unfortunately that's not going to happen.
[00:38:26.541 --> 00:38:42.095]  Unlike when Ronald Reagan ran the table in the early primaries, and George Bush finally threw in the towel by the Michigan primary, and the Republican establishment smelling a winner and desperate to get back at the trough, backed Reagan, you're not going to see that here.
[00:38:42.095 --> 00:38:48.080]  I still believe that there will be an attempt to stop Trump at a brokered convention.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.502]  These rules have been rigged against him.
[00:38:50.502 --> 00:38:51.463]  They are actually rigged.
[00:38:52.023 --> 00:38:56.089]  Against the Patriot Ron Paul, but those rules are still in place.
[00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:58.532]  I have a long piece coming for Breitbart.
[00:38:58.532 --> 00:39:03.118]  It explains exactly how the establishment hopes to stop Donald Trump.
[00:39:03.118 --> 00:39:06.682]  It is very clear that they have abandoned the corpse of Jeb Bush.
[00:39:07.523 --> 00:39:10.884]  I'd like to hope that my book played some small part in this.
[00:39:10.884 --> 00:39:18.047]  When George W. Bush was at the, uh, in South Carolina on Monday, for his big speech... Or stop right there, I don't mean to interrupt you.
[00:39:18.047 --> 00:39:22.428]  Your book, your advice, you don't like to brag, but you talk to Trump every day, obviously.
[00:39:22.428 --> 00:39:24.469]  He's listening to you, he's checking the facts.
[00:39:24.989 --> 00:39:26.670]  He's bringing out, hey Hillary, watch it.
[00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.072]  You know, your husband's a rapist.
[00:39:28.072 --> 00:39:30.273]  Hey Bush, don't say I'm not going to National Security.
[00:39:30.273 --> 00:39:31.595]  Your brother let 9-11 happen.
[00:39:31.595 --> 00:39:32.435]  Watch out.
[00:39:32.435 --> 00:39:37.940]  I mean, he is doing everything you advised in your books that were written specifically as a playbook.
[00:39:39.209 --> 00:39:41.790]  Well, that's a kind interpretation.
[00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.711]  Nobody puts words in Donald Trump's mouth, not even me.
[00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:48.012]  We've been friends for almost 40 years, but Trump knows his own mind.
[00:39:48.012 --> 00:39:49.372]  He's his own man.
[00:39:49.372 --> 00:39:51.173]  You can recommend things for him to read.
[00:39:51.173 --> 00:39:52.954]  He's a voracious reader.
[00:39:52.954 --> 00:39:56.255]  But he is unscripted, uncoached.
[00:39:56.255 --> 00:39:57.015]  No, I understand.
[00:39:57.015 --> 00:39:59.276]  It's just that you're really bringing him to the Modern Info War.
[00:40:00.575 --> 00:40:01.475]  Well, he gets it.
[00:40:01.475 --> 00:40:03.836]  I didn't have to tell him that the Iraq War was a disaster.
[00:40:03.836 --> 00:40:05.437]  He figured it out before I did.
[00:40:05.437 --> 00:40:06.077]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:40:06.077 --> 00:40:07.317]  Absolutely.
[00:40:07.317 --> 00:40:10.258]  And you don't have to tell him that there's many questions about 9-11.
[00:40:10.258 --> 00:40:15.460]  Look, we know that a number of the hijackers trained in Tampa, Florida.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:23.142]  We know that the neighbors tipped the local police and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement under Jeb Bush.
[00:40:23.142 --> 00:40:24.343]  And what happened?
[00:40:24.343 --> 00:40:24.863]  Nothing.
[00:40:24.863 --> 00:40:28.304]  Instead, Jeb Bush helped the Bin Laden's get on planes and get out of the country.
[00:40:29.201 --> 00:40:33.985]  You know, and for the Bush lackeys to now claim that it's outrageous.
[00:40:33.985 --> 00:40:37.647]  Look, Condoleezza Rice had multiple warnings.
[00:40:37.647 --> 00:40:40.890]  The Central Intelligence Agency had multiple warnings.
[00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:43.392]  The FBI had multiple warnings.
[00:40:43.392 --> 00:40:47.415]  But within the Bush administration, they weren't speaking to each other.
[00:40:47.415 --> 00:40:50.337]  That is a failure of leadership or it's willful.
[00:40:50.917 --> 00:40:55.821]  One or the other, whether it's incompetence or treason, is meaningless at this point.
[00:40:55.821 --> 00:41:02.946]  American interests were attacked and 3,000 innocent Americans died because of the policies of the Bush administration.
[00:41:07.429 --> 00:41:10.951]  It's also available at the StoneZone.com, your website.
[00:41:10.951 --> 00:41:12.292]  I don't care where you get it, folks.
[00:41:12.292 --> 00:41:29.742]  Get both the books and give them to a brain-dead, rhino, blue-blood Republican, and say, listen, this is a high-powered, top Republican strategist, eight administrations, worked inside four of them, you know, at the highest levels, and he's here explaining to you, you know, who these people really are.
[00:41:29.742 --> 00:41:30.443]  This is huge.
[00:41:30.443 --> 00:41:32.544]  You need to get both books, and then give them these liberal,
[00:41:33.144 --> 00:41:33.585]  I don't know.
[00:41:53.744 --> 00:42:02.733]  I mean, really, to watch how much what you've done, and you're all over TV fighting, and radio, is really affecting things, but the American people now are ready to listen.
[00:42:02.733 --> 00:42:08.258]  I mean, that shows there is a massive political revolt going on that is only going to get bigger.
[00:42:08.258 --> 00:42:09.720]  What do you expect the establishment to do?
[00:42:10.933 --> 00:42:11.753]  Well, it's interesting.
[00:42:11.753 --> 00:42:14.894]  They have tried in every turn to discredit Trump.
[00:42:14.894 --> 00:42:17.835]  He just does better and better.
[00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:24.457]  He raises the question of 9-11 and the question of the origins of the Iraq War in the last debate.
[00:42:24.457 --> 00:42:25.597]  The House was stacked.
[00:42:25.597 --> 00:42:26.518]  You can see that.
[00:42:26.518 --> 00:42:33.019]  The Republican National Committee, the South Carolina Republican Party stacked the audience with Rubio and Bush supporters.
[00:42:33.019 --> 00:42:34.440]  But those people booing
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:46.551]  Nor to Trump's benefit, because the television viewers across the country could see here's a guy standing up to the official false narrative of the American establishment.
[00:42:46.551 --> 00:42:50.875]  Trump's got enormous courage and enormous guts.
[00:42:50.875 --> 00:42:51.896]  He is his own man.
[00:42:51.896 --> 00:42:54.259]  He belongs to no special interest.
[00:42:56.181 --> 00:43:00.825]  The special interests, particularly in the mainstream media, they're apoplectic, Alex.
[00:43:00.825 --> 00:43:02.567]  They don't know what to do.
[00:43:02.567 --> 00:43:04.028]  They've pulled out all the stops.
[00:43:04.028 --> 00:43:05.490]  They've called him a racist.
[00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.031]  They've called him a sexist.
[00:43:07.031 --> 00:43:10.514]  They've tried to insinuate that he's associated with the mafia.
[00:43:10.514 --> 00:43:13.818]  The New York Daily News is now saying he is the Antichrist.
[00:43:14.753 --> 00:43:18.034]  Yeah, look, Mort Zuckerman owns the New York Daily News.
[00:43:18.034 --> 00:43:19.495]  He's a very short guy.
[00:43:19.495 --> 00:43:21.375]  He has no luck with women.
[00:43:21.375 --> 00:43:28.077]  And he's very, very jealous of Donald Trump, who is tall, handsome, and has the most beautiful wife on the planet.
[00:43:28.077 --> 00:43:30.858]  So that's just pure jealousy.
[00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:31.139]  It is.
[00:43:31.139 --> 00:43:32.279]  They're jealous.
[00:43:32.279 --> 00:43:34.060]  And I don't read the New York Daily News anymore.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.240]  I prefer the New York Post.
[00:43:36.414 --> 00:43:39.496]  Oh, they've written the most salacious hit pieces on me, but I just love it.
[00:43:39.496 --> 00:43:50.262]  I mean, they're so discredited, it just... They don't get, whether it's CNN or... that when they attack me, for example, it only makes me more credible when everybody comes to actually hear what I really said.
[00:43:50.262 --> 00:43:55.285]  Don't they get that polls are running almost 90% saying they think there's foul play with Scalia?
[00:43:55.285 --> 00:43:56.886]  Now, what is your view on that?
[00:43:56.886 --> 00:43:58.627]  I mean, what a key time for him to die.
[00:43:58.627 --> 00:44:00.548]  One of the great things Ronald Reagan did.
[00:44:00.548 --> 00:44:02.970]  Not a perfect justice, but compared to
[00:44:03.831 --> 00:44:08.320]  Compared to Kagan and Sotomayor and these socialists, I mean, we're in deep trouble.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.342]  We've got to get Trump in.
[00:44:09.342 --> 00:44:12.127]  I mean, what type of Supreme Court justice do you think he would appoint?
[00:44:12.987 --> 00:44:15.488]  Strict constructionist, a real conservative.
[00:44:15.488 --> 00:44:18.109]  He's not going to be tricked, that I can assure you.
[00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:21.831]  You're not going to get a David Souter from Donald Trump.
[00:44:21.831 --> 00:44:23.692]  He's a hardliner on crime.
[00:44:23.692 --> 00:44:29.015]  He wants somebody who follows the Constitution as it was originally written.
[00:44:29.015 --> 00:44:31.956]  Not a living, changing document, because that's not what it is.
[00:44:31.956 --> 00:44:40.020]  Trump understands that the Founding Fathers had a specific idea of what the Constitution is, and he would appoint a justice who supports that view.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:46.044]  I had a great conversation yesterday with Judge Andrew Napolitano, one of the great patriots in this country.
[00:44:46.044 --> 00:44:49.947]  A very close friend of Antonin Scalia.
[00:44:49.947 --> 00:44:51.809]  He would like an autopsy.
[00:44:51.809 --> 00:44:53.410]  It's common sense.
[00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:57.893]  I don't think any of us are claiming foul play.
[00:44:57.893 --> 00:45:00.776]  We'd like to rule out foul play.
[00:45:00.776 --> 00:45:08.742]  But common sense dictates that there be some investigation and some autopsy to make sure this wasn't another coup d'etat.
[00:45:08.882 --> 00:45:12.830]  So when SOP gets ignored at every level, there's some red flags there.
[00:45:13.581 --> 00:45:16.041]  Well, we've had coup d'etats in this country.
[00:45:16.041 --> 00:45:17.182]  We had one on November 22, 1963.
[00:45:17.182 --> 00:45:21.262]  We had another one at the time of Watergate.
[00:45:21.262 --> 00:45:26.183]  This could very well be yet another coup d'etat.
[00:45:26.183 --> 00:45:35.465]  The day Reagan was shot, the night before, and this is on record, folks, the Bushes were meeting with the Hinckley family.
[00:45:35.465 --> 00:45:37.845]  That was in the Denver Post, folks.
[00:45:37.845 --> 00:45:41.286]  And I believe from the evidence, you were in that administration, that they were trying to kill Reagan.
[00:45:42.179 --> 00:45:45.783]  Well, at a minimum, they were trying to kill him or they were trying to warn him.
[00:45:45.783 --> 00:45:48.866]  People don't understand the backstory here, but it's very simple.
[00:45:48.866 --> 00:46:02.720]  There was a struggle going on within the Reagan administration, which was brand new, between Secretary of State Al Haig, a patriot, and a man who quaintly believed that Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State, should control foreign policy, and George H.W.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.842]  Bush, who wanted control specifically
[00:46:05.482 --> 00:46:06.163]  We're good.
[00:46:26.374 --> 00:46:30.337]  Now, I establish in my book that there's a second gunman.
[00:46:30.337 --> 00:46:39.763]  I also establish that the bullet that hits Reagan comes from an upward trajectory, yet Hinckley is crouching in a low position.
[00:46:39.763 --> 00:46:47.728]  The idea that a bullet ricocheted off the door of the car and hit Reagan, that's a great idea, but there's no net or dent or evidence of that.
[00:46:47.728 --> 00:46:50.650]  The five bullets that are shot by Hinckley Jr.
[00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:52.151]  are all accounted for.
[00:46:52.151 --> 00:46:52.752]  None of them
[00:46:53.452 --> 00:46:54.793]  It's just like Sirhan Sirhan.
[00:46:54.793 --> 00:46:58.496]  That's why your book, Jeb and the Bush Crime Family, I could not put it down.
[00:46:58.496 --> 00:47:00.417]  It tells all of this, the whole history.
[00:47:00.417 --> 00:47:01.858]  Back to JFK.
[00:47:01.858 --> 00:47:02.619]  It's amazing.
[00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:05.581]  Bush's son was to dine with suspect's brother.
[00:47:05.581 --> 00:47:06.921]  That's the Houston Post.
[00:47:06.921 --> 00:47:11.705]  They found a different one, but you can find the Denver Post where he did dine with him just days before.
[00:47:11.705 --> 00:47:13.246]  I mean, what are the chances of that?
[00:47:14.206 --> 00:47:19.711]  Well, not only that, but John Hinckley Sr., a major financier of George Bush's campaigns in 1964, 1965.
[00:47:19.711 --> 00:47:24.595]  Was involved in a lot of clandestine ops.
[00:47:24.595 --> 00:47:25.255]  1980.
[00:47:25.255 --> 00:47:26.416]  And Hinckley Sr.
[00:47:26.416 --> 00:47:27.657]  is a CIA guy.
[00:47:27.657 --> 00:47:27.917]  Yeah.
[00:47:27.917 --> 00:47:31.521]  He's running an offshore oil company at the same time George H.W.
[00:47:31.521 --> 00:47:33.002]  Bush is running Zapata.
[00:47:33.382 --> 00:47:38.644]  And those companies are really just structured so they can make payoffs before it's time.
[00:47:38.644 --> 00:47:41.025]  What is the payoff to have your son locked up for decades?
[00:47:41.025 --> 00:47:45.967]  I mean, I guess they're going to let him out now, but just to be the patsy, that is a dedicated group of people right there.
[00:47:45.967 --> 00:47:54.371]  Well, remember, no matter what you may have read, CIA Director Bill Casey did not have a high regard for George Bush, thought he was a lightweight.
[00:47:54.371 --> 00:48:00.153]  So Bush could not count on his cronies in the Central Intelligence Agency to take a shot at Reagan.
[00:48:00.533 --> 00:48:02.955]  So they went to the only asset they had.
[00:48:02.955 --> 00:48:03.895]  John Hinckley Jr.
[00:48:03.895 --> 00:48:07.097]  is a troubled black sheep's son of a friend.
[00:48:07.097 --> 00:48:08.238]  He's perfect.
[00:48:08.238 --> 00:48:19.485]  Now, as you may know, Alex, he actually is quoted in his interview, in an interview, as saying that he shot Reagan so that his uncle, George Bush, could become president.
[00:48:19.485 --> 00:48:24.729]  Not his blood uncle, but it shows the closeness of the relationship between Clinton and Bush.
[00:48:25.799 --> 00:48:27.839]  Call Bush family, he calls them brother.
[00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:29.340]  It's totally sick.
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:34.241]  I want to accelerate to South Carolina, what we do, how the numbers are looking.
[00:48:34.241 --> 00:48:37.022]  I mean, am I wrong that Trump's gaining in South Carolina?
[00:48:37.022 --> 00:48:38.482]  Are those polls accurate?
[00:48:38.482 --> 00:48:41.563]  And then what do you make of the Pope waiting in?
[00:48:41.563 --> 00:48:42.903]  I mean, the Catholics are great people.
[00:48:42.903 --> 00:48:44.143]  A lot of my friends are Catholic.
[00:48:44.143 --> 00:48:45.303]  A lot of great Popes.
[00:48:45.303 --> 00:48:51.625]  But this guy, I mean, he's gone too far in my view, getting involved in our politics and, you know, saying that Trump isn't a Christian.
[00:48:52.659 --> 00:48:54.702]  I have a very good feeling about South Carolina.
[00:48:54.702 --> 00:48:58.767]  I feel even better since our friend Richard Reeves is out there keeping an eye on things.
[00:48:58.767 --> 00:49:00.088]  I think Trump is on the move.
[00:49:00.088 --> 00:49:01.390]  I think he's gaining.
[00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:05.375]  I think that the mainstream media attacks of him have backfired.
[00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:09.200]  Everybody said his raising the question of 9-11 and the Iraq War would hurt him.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.921]  Hasn't heard him at all.
[00:49:10.921 --> 00:49:13.423]  Americans are suspicious about both of those.
[00:49:13.423 --> 00:49:15.264]  They want to hear more.
[00:49:15.264 --> 00:49:16.565]  I think he's on a roll.
[00:49:16.565 --> 00:49:24.551]  Now, fortunately for us, the anti-Trumpist vote is split between Bush and Kasich and Rubio.
[00:49:24.551 --> 00:49:29.834]  Therefore, the only guy who can hurt Donald Trump in South Carolina is Ted Cruz.
[00:49:29.834 --> 00:49:37.600]  Not because Cruz can defeat Trump, because he can't, but he could siphon valuable votes from Trump that allow a Marco Rubio
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.020]  To emerge.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:42.001]  Now, I can tell you, I've got a lot of friends in the establishment.
[00:49:42.001 --> 00:49:42.641]  I eat with them.
[00:49:42.641 --> 00:49:43.301]  I drink with them.
[00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:44.782]  I laugh at them.
[00:49:44.782 --> 00:49:46.942]  But they've all switched to Rubio.
[00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:48.363]  They've all switched to Rubio.
[00:49:48.363 --> 00:49:50.623]  He is the establishment candidate.
[00:49:50.623 --> 00:49:52.704]  They've given up Jeb for dead.
[00:49:52.704 --> 00:49:53.904]  Too low energy.
[00:49:53.904 --> 00:49:54.684]  Too boring.
[00:49:54.684 --> 00:49:56.025]  Too much baggage.
[00:49:56.025 --> 00:50:04.427]  So, despite that $100 million in Wall Street money, trust me, Rubio is the candidate of the establishment.
[00:50:04.967 --> 00:50:11.393]  I fear Ted Cruz is a Manchurian Canadian candidate put in this race to siphon from Donald Trump.
[00:50:11.393 --> 00:50:13.735]  He has no general election appeal.
[00:50:13.735 --> 00:50:25.587]  Let me expand on that because I wanted to believe in Ted Cruz and obviously I like what he says, what he stands for, but he has been caught pulling dirty tricks, a bunch of them, and Donald Trump hasn't done that.
[00:50:26.227 --> 00:50:28.088]  And, you know, I don't like what he did to Carson.
[00:50:28.088 --> 00:50:29.929]  And I don't like how he spun it and everything.
[00:50:29.929 --> 00:50:31.989]  I mean, clearly that was a dirty trick.
[00:50:31.989 --> 00:50:33.750]  It's what you'd think the Bushes would do.
[00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:48.696]  And then I think about how he's praised Kissinger, he's praised the Bushes, and I really think now, because they know they can't run the Bush name anymore, more and more I think from the CFR and from, you know, these other connections, Goldman Sachs, it looks like Cruz could be their sock puppet.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.762]  Yeah, look, like you, I was initially attracted to Ted Cruz.
[00:50:52.762 --> 00:50:53.843]  I liked what he had to say.
[00:50:53.843 --> 00:50:55.143]  I liked his message.
[00:50:55.143 --> 00:50:56.584]  I liked his standing up for the U.S.
[00:50:56.584 --> 00:50:57.325]  Constitution.
[00:50:57.325 --> 00:50:59.166]  And then I looked a little closer.
[00:50:59.166 --> 00:51:02.267]  He was George W. Bush's top issue advisor.
[00:51:02.267 --> 00:51:04.789]  His wife, Heidi Cruz, I'm sure she's a nice lady,
[00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:09.431]  She was a deputy to Condoleezza Rice when they got us into this phony war.
[00:51:09.431 --> 00:51:10.772]  Then she went over to the U.S.
[00:51:10.772 --> 00:51:13.873]  Trade Representative's office where she was the Deputy U.S.
[00:51:13.873 --> 00:51:21.576]  Trade Representative in the Bush Administration, where she worked specifically on China policy, our current China trade policy.
[00:51:21.576 --> 00:51:24.258]  She's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:51:24.258 --> 00:51:27.039]  Now you add the shady, secret,
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.982]  I have to believe he's a Trojan horse.
[00:51:29.982 --> 00:51:33.707]  Clever, slick, articulate, but a Bush Republican.
[00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:44.551]  And we don't need more of them.
[00:51:44.551 --> 00:51:48.235]  We need to end their reign, as Pat Buchanan says.
[00:51:48.235 --> 00:51:50.498]  Pat's saying good stuff about Trump now.
[00:51:50.498 --> 00:51:57.726]  And, I mean, ideologically, I think he's basically, you know, the godson of people like Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon.
[00:51:57.726 --> 00:51:59.168]  I think that's a big plus as well.
[00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:03.461]  Yeah, no, Pat's piece is a terrific piece and he's exactly right.
[00:52:03.461 --> 00:52:07.524]  What we see right now is the rejection of Bush Republicanism.
[00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:10.386]  They have opened our borders to criminals.
[00:52:10.386 --> 00:52:12.728]  They've destroyed our finances.
[00:52:12.728 --> 00:52:14.749]  They have plunged us into debt.
[00:52:14.749 --> 00:52:19.472]  They have bailed out their friends on Wall Street at our expense.
[00:52:19.472 --> 00:52:25.256]  They've destroyed our trade policy with other countries so that we're constantly on the short end of the stick.
[00:52:25.256 --> 00:52:28.939]  Donald Trump is the last best hope for the salvation of this country.
[00:52:29.019 --> 00:52:33.443]  Well, isn't that presidential that they have to bring in this radical change agent pope?
[00:52:33.443 --> 00:52:39.768]  They've had a coup in the Vatican, a blackmail that's even come out in the London Guardian, kicking the other guy out, sending him to Gandalf Castle.
[00:52:39.768 --> 00:52:42.090]  That's never happened in 2,000 years of popes.
[00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:48.395]  I mean, all this craziness is happening right now, and this guy's saying Donald Trump's the devil when he's behind 200-foot walls.
[00:52:48.395 --> 00:52:51.357]  I mean, it's just, people see through this.
[00:52:51.357 --> 00:52:54.640]  I mean, they are, the power structure is hysterical.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.521]  Now, you talked about
[00:52:56.321 --> 00:52:57.182]  A bulletproof vest.
[00:52:57.182 --> 00:53:01.084]  Anybody can look and see he's wearing one, but the ignorant public says, what's that under his shirt?
[00:53:01.084 --> 00:53:01.865]  Why doesn't he button it?
[00:53:01.865 --> 00:53:05.047]  Well, he's wearing a thick bulletproof vest and more, carrying a gun.
[00:53:05.047 --> 00:53:06.268]  Now they criticize him for that.
[00:53:06.268 --> 00:53:08.189]  I mean, the disconnect.
[00:53:08.189 --> 00:53:09.070]  This guy's a hero.
[00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.571]  He's under amazing danger.
[00:53:10.571 --> 00:53:12.692]  He's willing to talk about the elephant in the room.
[00:53:12.692 --> 00:53:14.814]  Saudi Arabia, the 9-11 stand down.
[00:53:14.814 --> 00:53:16.415]  That will bring down the Clintons on the bushes.
[00:53:16.415 --> 00:53:20.698]  I mean, when he did that and really got intense the last week, it brought tears to my eyes.
[00:53:21.258 --> 00:53:23.920]  And I just, I'm so glad I backed Trump.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:24.780]  He's the real deal.
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.161]  There's no way.
[00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:27.962]  He's an establishment scammer.
[00:53:27.962 --> 00:53:29.043]  They would not let him do this.
[00:53:29.043 --> 00:53:30.844]  They, I can look at their body language.
[00:53:30.844 --> 00:53:33.346]  They are crapping their pants, Mr. Stone.
[00:53:33.346 --> 00:53:38.789]  And for lack of a better term, they are scared to death like vampires being hauled out at high noon.
[00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:42.251]  I am really concerned about Donald Trump right now.
[00:53:42.251 --> 00:53:43.012]  I've got to be honest.
[00:53:43.012 --> 00:53:44.733]  I'm not fear mongering.
[00:53:44.733 --> 00:53:47.615]  I think he's the most under threat man on earth right now.
[00:53:48.595 --> 00:53:50.075]  Yeah, look, he's very courageous.
[00:53:50.075 --> 00:53:50.956]  He's very brave.
[00:53:50.956 --> 00:53:57.137]  My wife and I pray for him every night because clearly he is threatening the establishment where they live.
[00:53:57.137 --> 00:54:00.098]  Wait till he starts talking about monetary policy.
[00:54:00.098 --> 00:54:01.498]  I know his views.
[00:54:01.498 --> 00:54:03.139]  He wants a sound dollar.
[00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:05.179]  He's not a big fan of the Fed.
[00:54:05.179 --> 00:54:07.920]  So he is scaring the central bankers.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.481]  He's scaring the Washington, Wall Street, D.C.
[00:54:12.481 --> 00:54:14.662]  consultant lobbyist class.
[00:54:15.662 --> 00:54:19.524]  The permanent government class that's hijacked the country is scared to death.
[00:54:19.524 --> 00:54:20.245]  Yes.
[00:54:20.245 --> 00:54:20.485]  Absolutely.
[00:54:20.485 --> 00:54:21.105]  Tell us his views.
[00:54:21.105 --> 00:54:22.065]  That's the one question he was on.
[00:54:22.065 --> 00:54:24.587]  I know he's probably going to come on soon.
[00:54:24.587 --> 00:54:28.048]  The one question I didn't get to is, what is his view on auditing the Fed?
[00:54:28.048 --> 00:54:38.834]  And another question I want him to talk about is, would he try to end the persecution of the Christian Church with the IRS, and specifically try to point out that 501c3 doesn't muzzle free speech?
[00:54:39.958 --> 00:54:41.938]  I think the answer on all three is yes.
[00:54:41.938 --> 00:54:55.101]  First of all, he's already talked about repealing some of the IRS ordinances put in place, ironically, by Lyndon Johnson to muzzle Christian organizations from criticizing his administration back in the 60s.
[00:54:55.101 --> 00:55:00.002]  Those regulations are still in place and they're being used to muzzle Christians.
[00:55:00.002 --> 00:55:02.963]  As far as banks, does anyone know banks better than Donald Trump?
[00:55:03.343 --> 00:55:06.246]  He has led the New York banks around by the nose.
[00:55:06.246 --> 00:55:11.610]  As Trump continues to say, in our trade negotiations, we have the leverage.
[00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:13.131]  We just don't know how to use it.
[00:55:13.131 --> 00:55:18.376]  We send social workers out to do our negotiating instead of hard-nosed business people.
[00:55:18.376 --> 00:55:20.457]  Donald Trump could revolutionize this country.
[00:55:20.457 --> 00:55:23.020]  He's deeply suspicious of the Fed.
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:24.501]  And I think he is open-minded.
[00:55:25.642 --> 00:55:33.450]  He's never said that, but I know his views.
[00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:36.153]  He doesn't trust anything he's hearing out of Washington.
[00:55:36.153 --> 00:55:37.174]  That's for sure.
[00:55:37.174 --> 00:55:39.757]  He recognizes a broken system.
[00:55:39.757 --> 00:55:42.080]  He is the last best chance for reform.
[00:55:43.287 --> 00:55:45.048]  So, what's a big win?
[00:55:45.048 --> 00:55:45.768]  Because they've already said it.
[00:55:45.768 --> 00:55:49.309]  If he doesn't win by 20 extra points in South Carolina, he's a loser.
[00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:51.070]  I guess if he won by 100, he'd be a loser.
[00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:53.551]  If he doesn't win by a big margin in Nevada, he's a loser.
[00:55:53.551 --> 00:56:01.734]  I mean, obviously that spin's not going to work, but in your real political calculus, Mr. Stone, what is a win versus something that's a draw?
[00:56:01.734 --> 00:56:03.015]  How big a win does he need?
[00:56:04.095 --> 00:56:06.298]  Look, I think a win is a win and a win is a win.
[00:56:06.298 --> 00:56:10.622]  At the end of the day, if he wins by one vote, that's still first place.
[00:56:10.622 --> 00:56:14.006]  I think he gets in over 30% and that's comfortable.
[00:56:14.006 --> 00:56:15.968]  I have much greater concern about Nevada.
[00:56:15.968 --> 00:56:17.289]  I want to be candid about this.
[00:56:17.289 --> 00:56:19.391]  First of all, it's not a primary, it's a caucus.
[00:56:19.391 --> 00:56:21.273]  And they're known for Hanky Panky there.
[00:56:21.273 --> 00:56:23.616]  And there's a disproportionate Mormon influence.
[00:56:24.436 --> 00:56:31.221]  Just because of the makeup, almost 7 out of 10 primary voters will be members of the Church of Latter Day Saints.
[00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:34.243]  They are firmly behind Marco Rubio.
[00:56:34.243 --> 00:56:39.067]  The political establishment in the state is firmly behind Marco Rubio.
[00:56:39.067 --> 00:56:45.871]  Ted Cruz has been slowing getting off the ground there, which is good because there's less of a drain on Donald Trump.
[00:56:45.871 --> 00:56:48.573]  But I'm far more concerned about Nevada.
[00:56:49.474 --> 00:56:51.615]  Then I am about South Carolina.
[00:56:51.615 --> 00:56:54.256]  I feel a big victory coming on Saturday.
[00:56:54.256 --> 00:56:56.718]  I think Jeb is on his last legs.
[00:56:56.718 --> 00:57:02.240]  I know a lot of the Bush money people are now advising the family to pull the plug on Jeb's candidacy.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:08.684]  Remains to be seen whether that really happens, but we are on our way, on the other hand, unlike Reagan.
[00:57:09.324 --> 00:57:12.645]  The establishment will never throw in the towel.
[00:57:12.645 --> 00:57:15.466]  They will monkey with the rules at this convention.
[00:57:15.466 --> 00:57:26.529]  They will seek to change the rules to allow a white knight who has no delegates to be nominated, maybe a Mitt Romney, or maybe we bring back some combination of Romney and Rubio.
[00:57:26.529 --> 00:57:30.070]  But you can count on monkey business at the Republican convention.
[00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:36.252]  The establishment will not give up the ghost until Donald Trump puts his hand on the Bible and takes the oath.
[00:57:36.832 --> 00:57:39.714]  You know what, I know you've got to go because you're really busy fighting.
[00:57:39.714 --> 00:57:41.295]  We've got to go to break here for 70 seconds.
[00:57:41.295 --> 00:57:45.537]  I want to just come back and get specifically for four or five minutes into Jeb and the Bush crime family.
[00:57:45.537 --> 00:57:46.798]  Can you do that, Roger?
[00:57:46.798 --> 00:57:47.238]  Absolutely.
[00:57:47.238 --> 00:57:47.798]  Fantastic.
[00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:50.040]  We're going to go to break here in just a moment.

[00:57:58.084 --> 00:58:00.386]  Roger Stone and Robert Morrow.
[00:58:00.386 --> 00:58:01.346]  Very powerful books.
[00:58:01.346 --> 00:58:03.307]  You absolutely have to get them.
[00:58:03.307 --> 00:58:04.788]  Also, we have some other specials.

[00:58:08.731 --> 00:58:10.472]  I have to end the 20% off sale.
[00:58:10.472 --> 00:58:12.894]  And they'll still sell out by Monday, probably, they think.
[00:58:12.894 --> 00:58:16.476]  Super Female, we've got enough of that for a few weeks, so we can keep the 20% off on that.
[00:58:16.476 --> 00:58:17.236]  And here's a little secret.
[00:58:17.236 --> 00:58:18.137]  It works on men.
[00:58:18.137 --> 00:58:20.398]  It's pretty much the same herbs, a little bit different formula.
[00:58:20.398 --> 00:58:21.199]  It's a tweak for women.
[00:58:21.199 --> 00:58:25.642]  But some guys, I personally like the female better, because it's got some

[01:00:37.203 --> 01:00:38.363]  The various victims of Bill Clinton
[01:00:53.991 --> 01:01:02.957]  Those who were raped or attacked or assaulted, those women are getting organized and I think a number of them are going to speak out this fall.
[01:01:02.957 --> 01:01:11.502]  One particular woman I want to talk about, very brave, very courageous, someone the Clintons have attempted to crush, Alex, and that is Kathleen Willey.
[01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:14.364]  Now I know you had her on your show and I'm grateful for that.
[01:01:15.044 --> 01:01:18.688]  She is struggling to hold on to her home, which is in foreclosure.
[01:01:18.688 --> 01:01:21.331]  The Clintons have put enormous economic pressure on her.
[01:01:21.331 --> 01:01:24.915]  She wasn't even going public until they killed her cat and threatened to kill her kids.
[01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:25.716]  Right, exactly.
[01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:29.159]  But in this particular case, they have discouraged employers.
[01:01:29.159 --> 01:01:32.002]  I believe that they are playing with her mortgage company.
[01:01:32.002 --> 01:01:34.845]  You can go to helpwilly.com right now.
[01:01:34.845 --> 01:01:35.346]  Let's put it up.
[01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:38.026]  It's W-I-L-L-E-Y.
[01:01:38.026 --> 01:01:48.328]  Every dime we raise is going to pay off her mortgage so she can hit the road and start speaking out on Hillary and not worry about her cat and her home and her domicile.
[01:01:48.328 --> 01:01:49.789]  And I tell you, I'm not mad at the listeners.
[01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:52.709]  They're great people, but we plugged this last time and had like $80 in it or something.
[01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:52.969]  Only $3,970, folks.
[01:01:52.969 --> 01:01:53.549]  She needs $93,000.
[01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:54.509]  We're in a political war.
[01:01:54.509 --> 01:01:57.050]  You've got to spend your money in this fight in every way.
[01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:07.213]  Putting up billboards, going on radio yourself, whatever it is.
[01:02:07.213 --> 01:02:08.274]  I'm not lecturing people.
[01:02:08.274 --> 01:02:12.916]  You've done a great job, but this is how we're going to beat them.
[01:02:12.916 --> 01:02:18.159]  Because they're trying to take her house right now, and she said if she could not be homeless, she'll be able to go out on the road against the Clintons.
[01:02:18.159 --> 01:02:21.741]  So, let's put that website up again one more time for folks.
[01:02:21.741 --> 01:02:25.522]  And again, and pray for, even if you don't have money, that's whatever's fine.
[01:02:25.522 --> 01:02:28.184]  It's a GoFundMe, Willie Mortgage Trust Fund.
[01:02:28.604 --> 01:02:30.165]  And that's what it comes down to.
[01:02:30.165 --> 01:02:34.167]  Or, a short circuit this, go right to HelpWilly.com.
[01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.248]  HelpWilly, W-I-L-L-E-E-Y.
[01:02:36.248 --> 01:02:39.810]  Now, the good news is... By the way, we're going to tweet that, we're going to Facebook it right now.
[01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:41.691]  We haven't really done that yet, so we're going to do that right now.
[01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:42.152]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:02:42.152 --> 01:02:42.892]  I appreciate it.
[01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:45.293]  We have raised a substantial amount of money.
[01:02:45.293 --> 01:02:47.074]  Trump is himself a contributor.
[01:02:47.074 --> 01:02:49.636]  I'm not ready to disclose what he has given.
[01:02:49.636 --> 01:02:52.978]  And many, many other... Okay, so that GoFundMe is only one thing?
[01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:56.360]  That is only one receptacle, and there are... Okay, so the best place to go is, again...
[01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:59.251]  Helpwillie.com.
[01:02:59.251 --> 01:03:02.414]  Willie spelled W-I-L-L-E-Y.
[01:03:02.414 --> 01:03:06.057]  Helpwillie.com will take you right to one of our pages.
[01:03:06.057 --> 01:03:07.859]  We have numerous receptacles.
[01:03:07.859 --> 01:03:11.663]  We have raised substantially more than $39.70.
[01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:15.126]  We're haggling with the mortgage company even as we speak.
[01:03:15.126 --> 01:03:21.412]  And I am still hopeful that we can save Kathleen's home so she can go out on the road and take the fight right to the glens.
[01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:23.798]  Well, you're certainly fighting hard.
[01:03:23.798 --> 01:03:27.161]  I gotta say, I'm not just bragging or you're trying to act like we're heroes, because we're not.
[01:03:27.161 --> 01:03:27.841]  We're just fighting this.
[01:03:27.841 --> 01:03:33.707]  But this is dangerous what I'm doing, it's dangerous what you're doing, it's about 50 times more dangerous for Donald Trump.
[01:03:33.707 --> 01:03:37.711]  I mean, I hope folks out there that haven't been involved in politics at this level understand this is not a game.
[01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:38.872]  We're fighting a mafia.
[01:03:38.872 --> 01:03:40.253]  We've got 60 seconds left, sir.
[01:03:40.253 --> 01:03:40.894]  Final comments.
[01:03:42.488 --> 01:03:46.090]  Look, I think that the emphasis now needs to be on Nevada.
[01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:52.014]  If you have friends in Nevada, if you know people in Nevada, you have cousins or relatives in Nevada, get in touch with them.
[01:03:52.014 --> 01:03:56.577]  That is where the establishment is going to try to short-circuit Donald Trump.
[01:03:56.577 --> 01:03:58.358]  He's going to win in South Carolina.
[01:03:58.358 --> 01:04:02.220]  When George W. Bush was in the state, they had to bus people in to fill out the crowd.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.842]  The Bushes have worn out their welcome.
[01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:09.766]  Americans want another Bush like we want another Clinton, which is to say, not at all.
[01:04:09.766 --> 01:04:14.229]  This, this is the last best hope for American democracy.
[01:04:14.229 --> 01:04:16.931]  Donald Trump is a nationalist.
[01:04:16.931 --> 01:04:19.954]  He believes in American sovereignty.
[01:04:19.954 --> 01:04:24.938]  He would appoint justices in the Supreme Court that Alex, you and I would be proud of.
[01:04:24.938 --> 01:04:28.781]  This fight is now, it is today, and victory is this close.
[01:04:29.361 --> 01:04:31.623]  And that's why it's suspicious that Scalia died.
[01:04:31.623 --> 01:04:35.005]  And even more suspicious, they said that we're not supposed to ask questions.
[01:04:35.005 --> 01:04:35.545]  Indeed.
[01:04:35.545 --> 01:04:36.726]  Very, very suspicious.
[01:04:36.726 --> 01:04:38.848]  Look, perhaps it's entirely innocent.
[01:04:38.848 --> 01:04:39.168]  Yes.
[01:04:39.168 --> 01:04:40.269]  That's possible.
[01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:42.070]  I'd just like to know for sure.
[01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:46.473]  I'd like to see a full investigation, not a Warren Commission-type investigation.
[01:04:46.473 --> 01:04:47.914]  And I'd like to see an autopsy.
[01:04:47.914 --> 01:04:53.878]  I think any clear-thinking, reasonable American would see the wisdom of that position.
[01:04:53.878 --> 01:04:55.419]  Roger Stone, Godspeed.
[01:04:55.419 --> 01:04:56.320]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:04:57.325 --> 01:04:59.327]  Alex, I'll see you next Friday and I look forward to it.
[01:04:59.327 --> 01:05:03.430]  North Korea is planning a terrorist attack on South Korea.
[01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:12.296]  This according to the National Intelligence Service that says North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, gave the order to begin preparations.
[01:05:12.296 --> 01:05:20.662]  The NIS warning covered a large number of possible targets, including subways, shopping malls and even a nuclear power plant.
[01:05:21.002 --> 01:05:26.129]  All key lines of communication between North and South Korea have been cut off.
[01:05:26.129 --> 01:05:38.484]  I've long predicted in my world affairs briefs that the North Korean attack on South Korea will be a trigger event for World War III, and you'll probably have a nuclear EMP and nuclear strike on America within a week after that's started.
[01:05:38.584 --> 01:05:49.254]  Now is political scientist and author of Strategic Relocation, Joel Skousen, who says that a fight between North and South Korea might be a trigger event to World War III.
[01:05:49.254 --> 01:05:50.215]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[01:05:50.215 --> 01:05:53.538]  forces in the region are making their presence known.
[01:05:53.538 --> 01:05:56.340]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:58.382 --> 01:06:03.185]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[01:06:55.424 --> 01:06:56.725]  Check it out for yourself today.
[01:06:59.554 --> 01:07:03.317]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:07:03.317 --> 01:07:11.062]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:07:11.062 --> 01:07:19.688]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:07:19.688 --> 01:07:29.394]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:07:29.394 --> 01:07:30.515]  We're good to go.
[01:08:00.495 --> 01:08:03.241]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.241 --> 01:08:06.027]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:35.297 --> 01:08:40.100]  A recent headline on The Drudge Report reads, Europe on the brink of new refugee swarm.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:46.544]  Which links back to a Washington Post article, spring could bring a fresh surge of refugees, but Europe isn't ready for them.
[01:08:46.544 --> 01:08:56.270]  Last week, February 10th, 2016, George Soros wrote an opinion piece for the website ProjectSyndicate.com, flatly blaming Vladimir Putin for the refugee crisis across Europe.
[01:08:56.270 --> 01:09:03.014]  Soros wrote, Putin's current aim is to foster the EU's disintegration, and the best way to do so is flood the EU with Syrian refugees.
[01:09:03.354 --> 01:09:13.562]  Ironically enough, prior to this statement, Soros had been one of the most outspoken advocates for nations across Europe to help with the Middle East crisis by creating a stable plan for accepting refugees into their societies.
[01:09:13.562 --> 01:09:17.384]  Now let's review a few key statements leading up to Soros' remarks last week.
[01:09:17.384 --> 01:09:25.490]  In September of 2015, months before the Russian action against ISIS, Soros posted this article on ProjectSyndicate.com, Rebuilding the Asylum System.
[01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:28.853]  He actually says the EU needs a comprehensive plan to respond to the crisis.
[01:09:29.173 --> 01:09:38.275]  One that reasserts effective governance over the flows of asylum seekers so that they can take place in a safe, orderly way at a pace that reflects Europe's capacity to absorb them.
[01:09:38.275 --> 01:09:50.698]  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban responded to Soros' statement in October by accusing him of using the migrants as mere pawns for, quote, well-organized money movers, those thinking beyond nation states and leaders who have never been elected.
[01:09:50.698 --> 01:09:52.839]  Europe has been betrayed, Orban continued.
[01:09:52.839 --> 01:09:56.580]  If we don't stand up for it, the continent will no longer be for those citizens living here.
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:00.941]  Then, in mid-November 2015, Putin launched his offensive against ISIS.
[01:10:00.941 --> 01:10:06.582]  It appears that Soros completely changed his position, blaming the refugee crisis entirely on the Russian military action.
[01:10:06.582 --> 01:10:08.822]  Which, of course, makes no chronological sense.
[01:10:08.822 --> 01:10:19.024]  There certainly is a lot of finger-pointing over what appears to be who is at fault for carrying out the agenda to move a third world refugee population into Europe to permanently alter European life as we know it.
[01:10:19.024 --> 01:10:26.205]  If we draw a line back to Count Richard Kodenhev-Kalergi, known for being the founder of the first popular United Europe movement, the Pan-Europa Movement,
[01:10:26.385 --> 01:10:29.467]  Kalerji called for a united Europe to counter a growing Russian threat.
[01:10:29.467 --> 01:10:37.193]  His vision was a United States of Europe which would eventually expand into a complete world order and will be populated by a culturally homogenized people.
[01:10:37.193 --> 01:10:40.916]  Kalerji envisioned a world where migrant races will be integrated into Europe.
[01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:44.018]  Europe would therefore be populated by the man of the future.
[01:10:44.018 --> 01:10:47.180]  Kalerji wrote, the man of the future will be of mixed race.
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:51.984]  Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing space, time, and prejudice.
[01:10:51.984 --> 01:10:55.927]  The Eurasian Negroid race of the future, similar in its appearance to the ancient Egyptians,
[01:10:56.107 --> 01:10:56.707]  We're good to go!
[01:11:14.594 --> 01:11:17.796]  Which present a clearer explanation for the present situation.
[01:11:17.796 --> 01:11:21.157]  Soros is simply carrying forward the progressive agenda of his forerunner.
[01:11:21.157 --> 01:11:27.360]  The plan for a united Europe has always included an agenda for what clergy described as the Eurasian Negroid race of the future.
[01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:35.138]  Many experts have already warned that the refugee crisis threatens to bring European culture to its knees if the situation is not brought under control soon.
[01:11:35.138 --> 01:11:38.862]  The end of some, however, represents the beginning of a new world order.
[01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:42.546]  As the winter ice thaws, will we see a new surge in the clergy plan?
[01:11:42.546 --> 01:11:46.230]  Or will the nation-states of Europe begin to control their own borders?
[01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:48.793]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:49.634 --> 01:11:51.275]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:11:51.275 --> 01:11:52.776]  You can't survive without it.
[01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:53.977]  But where do you get it?
[01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:59.960]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand-new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:05.883]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:12:05.883 --> 01:12:13.548]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities.
[01:12:16.409 --> 01:12:23.131]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:12:23.131 --> 01:12:25.612]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:12:25.612 --> 01:12:27.093]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:28.133]  Easy assembly.
[01:12:28.133 --> 01:12:29.033]  Low maintenance.
[01:12:29.033 --> 01:12:31.134]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:12:48.401 --> 01:12:51.763]  And don't tell me that I'm a weirdo because I'm upset about this.
[01:12:51.763 --> 01:12:54.144]  I'm just sick of dishonorable trash!
[01:12:54.144 --> 01:12:57.305]  Supreme Cobra Commander!
[01:12:57.305 --> 01:12:58.186]  You're failures!
[01:12:58.186 --> 01:13:00.787]  You think I'd sell my family out like you dirtbag!
[01:13:02.329 --> 01:13:13.052]  Alright folks, we ran that little piece from last night's Nightly News that Rob Jacobson and Rob Dew put together and it had one of the ads for the Nightly News on the back of it and we didn't run that on purpose.
[01:13:13.052 --> 01:13:24.975]  That just reminded me how important it is to filter your water and then we have 10% off on the water filtration systems that are already the lowest prices, super high quality gravity fed systems, three different great brands.
[01:13:26.255 --> 01:13:35.808]  Some are better at taking out certain things than others, but really I think they're all pretty much equal, whether it's the Pro One systems or the Alexa Pure, and of course the whole
[01:13:36.923 --> 01:13:46.168]  ProOne Systems from ProPure now have the new amazing fast flow shower filter system that has four different stages in it.
[01:13:46.168 --> 01:13:46.988]  Simply amazing.
[01:13:46.988 --> 01:13:47.708]  A real innovation.
[01:13:47.708 --> 01:13:53.111]  We have the LifeStraw and so much more available at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:13:53.111 --> 01:13:55.932]  And your purchase also funds this operation.
[01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:58.714]  We had former Donald Trump campaign manager
[01:14:00.054 --> 01:14:10.860]  And of course, one of his chief advisors, Roger Stone, on earlier, just dropping bombshell after bombshell, he said that Donald would want to audit the Federal Reserve, a question I forgot to ask him.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.941]  Next time he's on, I will ask it.
[01:14:12.941 --> 01:14:15.662]  And he went on to say that, yes, Donald Trump is in a lot of danger.
[01:14:15.662 --> 01:14:19.944]  And he went on to just talk about so many amazing things.
[01:14:19.944 --> 01:14:27.268]  And he said, Scalia, without doing the investigation with the mysterious death, could be a coup d'etat.
[01:14:28.447 --> 01:14:30.788]  Pretty big interview in the last hour.
[01:14:30.788 --> 01:14:46.032]  Now, we're going to briefly pop in with Richard Reeves, who has been filing a lot of really important reports and investigating how they're trying to steal delegates, not just in New Hampshire or other areas, but ahead into Nevada and, of course, the situation with South Carolina.
[01:14:46.032 --> 01:14:48.813]  That's all coming up Saturday night.
[01:14:48.813 --> 01:14:51.174]  Peter Schiff on the melting down.
[01:14:52.014 --> 01:14:57.816]  World economy and the Chinese government trying to buy the stock exchange here in the U.S., the mercantile in Chicago.
[01:14:57.816 --> 01:15:02.138]  He's going to be popping in as well.
[01:15:02.138 --> 01:15:17.805]  And then we've got Dr. Group popping in briefly on a bunch of health news, and then Kit Daniels, Biggs, Wayne Madsen in studio, David Knight, all of them in the fourth hour, back from their in-depth investigation, confrontations, you name it, going into judges' chambers.
[01:15:19.085 --> 01:15:21.827]  Droning the property, just amazing.
[01:15:21.827 --> 01:15:23.768]  Speaking of drones, I've got news on that.
[01:15:23.768 --> 01:15:28.552]  Today's the day it starts that even a two-pound drone, or is it a half-pound drone?
[01:15:28.552 --> 01:15:29.713]  I had the New York Times this morning.
[01:15:29.713 --> 01:15:30.913]  I didn't see it in my stack.
[01:15:30.913 --> 01:15:32.314]  Will you guys give me that?
[01:15:32.314 --> 01:15:33.895]  No, it's a half-pound drone.
[01:15:33.895 --> 01:15:38.759]  The littlest ones at the store that your kid gets that fly ten feet in the air are, you know, half a pound.
[01:15:40.217 --> 01:15:45.561]  Federal crime if you don't register them, and then once they're registered, they admit they're gonna ban you flying them.
[01:15:45.561 --> 01:15:48.964]  And now they're going to ban gas-powered planes I was flying when I was a kid.
[01:15:48.964 --> 01:15:56.710]  So they use a few bad people flying drones around, you know, and crashing them at the White House, little toys, to take all of our rights.
[01:15:56.710 --> 01:15:59.171]  That's another big, big example.
[01:15:59.171 --> 01:16:01.653]  No, you prosecute that person.
[01:16:01.653 --> 01:16:05.276]  But anyways, the high-dollar drones we've been buying, they're like $3,000, $4,000, you know, super expensive.
[01:16:05.276 --> 01:16:05.916]  You can get $20,000 ones.
[01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:12.303]  That we've been getting great shots and great investigations with.
[01:16:12.303 --> 01:16:15.983]  They already have geolocation in them where they won't even get near the Capitol.
[01:16:15.983 --> 01:16:24.545]  Like, I want to take the drones out and show people they've got geolocation in their chips and with your cell phone that controls them or with the controller.
[01:16:24.545 --> 01:16:28.626]  We have three different drones where it will not go into certain areas.
[01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:33.326]  And so that's another example of smart cars and smart tech in the future total control.
[01:16:33.326 --> 01:16:35.627]  They just put another program in and you can't drive your car.
[01:16:36.522 --> 01:16:48.694]  I mean, think of the level of control this technocracy brings and all the new cars coming out already have the quote smart car stuff in and the quote stops you before you rear-end somebody or takes control.
[01:16:48.694 --> 01:16:54.239]  This is the beginning of the AI takeover and it's a very, very serious situation.
[01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:57.182]  So a ton of big news coming up.
[01:16:57.182 --> 01:16:58.023]  For the latest,
[01:16:58.303 --> 01:17:00.684]  From South Carolina, Richard Reeves.
[01:17:00.684 --> 01:17:04.866]  By the way, I like the Peter Prince haircut, the Blackwater haircut.
[01:17:04.866 --> 01:17:06.067]  You look sharp, Richard.
[01:17:06.067 --> 01:17:07.047]  I like that.
[01:17:07.047 --> 01:17:08.708]  You're there with a big ol' cannon in the background.
[01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:11.190]  You got an aircraft carrier there in the background.
[01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:13.251]  Looks like 4th of July or something.
[01:17:13.251 --> 01:17:15.532]  What has developed since we checked in with you yesterday?
[01:17:16.292 --> 01:17:19.374]  Well, Alex, more has developed than we have time to even talk about.
[01:17:19.374 --> 01:17:21.076]  We are here at Patriot's Point.
[01:17:21.076 --> 01:17:33.665]  Right behind me is the USS Yorktown, and the main difference between that ship that is now a museum and the GOP establishment is that it sits upright and it's afloat, because the GOP establishment is in big trouble, buddy.
[01:17:34.065 --> 01:17:46.512]  And it's good news for us, because one thing that Roger Stone didn't get to mention, because he didn't know about it, because I know the mainstream media doesn't want to talk about it, is because Marco Rubio pulled another big giant absentee showing last night.
[01:17:46.512 --> 01:17:54.717]  They had in Greenville, South Carolina, they had a three-candidate event with Marco Rubio scheduled with Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.
[01:17:56.158 --> 01:18:01.943]  5,000 ardent conservatives showed up and Marco Rubio went out.
[01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:02.704]  He was afraid.
[01:18:02.704 --> 01:18:05.307]  It was too much Ted Cruz in the crowd.
[01:18:05.307 --> 01:18:07.028]  He's backed out of that event.
[01:18:07.028 --> 01:18:12.994]  And we know he did because what happened was is Matt, my cameraman and I, we were at a Rubio event earlier in the day.
[01:18:13.757 --> 01:18:25.166]  Trey Gowdy, Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina, and the Governor of South Carolina, they were all tied at the hip with Marco Rubio all day long.
[01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:39.636]  Well, Tim Scott and Trey Gowdy for sure showed up at that event last night, and they were willing to be surrogates in Marco Rubio's place, and to the credit of the organizers of the event, they said no because they had disallowed a surrogate for Jeb Bush days ago.
[01:18:39.636 --> 01:18:40.917]  They said, no, we're not having surrogates.
[01:18:41.738 --> 01:18:45.461]  Rubio in no show, chickens out of the bait.
[01:18:45.461 --> 01:18:48.804]  The headline is Rubio peed his pants.
[01:18:48.804 --> 01:18:49.444]  Well, that's right.
[01:18:49.444 --> 01:18:52.807]  You know, he's famous for being absent on Senate votes.
[01:18:52.807 --> 01:18:57.731]  Well, I'll tell you what, what's going to happen when he has a face down with Putin or some other important world leader?
[01:18:57.731 --> 01:19:03.056]  So let's not forget this because Alex... Maybe he can sit on Putin's knee and ask for Christmas presents.
[01:19:03.056 --> 01:19:03.736]  Unbelievable.
[01:19:03.736 --> 01:19:08.961]  So obviously, Alex, has this been reported in the national press in Austin at all?
[01:19:09.713 --> 01:19:14.075]  No, I would get the data over to one of our writers and have them get a story out.
[01:19:14.075 --> 01:19:14.515]  That's it.
[01:19:14.515 --> 01:19:23.579]  Well, we uploaded a video earlier talking about it, and so that's posted now, but it's called Another Bonafide for Trump, Another Absence for Rubio.
[01:19:23.579 --> 01:19:25.980]  So, folks, watch that YouTube video on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:26.880]  Richard, we're going to break.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:27.841]  What else are we learning?
[01:19:27.841 --> 01:19:29.361]  I mean, I see the polls are all over the place.
[01:19:29.361 --> 01:19:32.583]  Do you think it's accurate that Trump is still gaining more and more every day?
[01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:35.063]  Well, thank you, Pope!
[01:19:35.063 --> 01:19:35.904]  Thank you, Pope!
[01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.064]  That's another thing.
[01:19:37.064 --> 01:19:44.049]  South Carolina Christians are pretty offended over the Pope's comments that Trump's not a Christian, because conservatives here, they want a wall, too!
[01:19:44.049 --> 01:19:49.913]  They want illegal immigration controlled, so they took it as a personal offense, Alex.
[01:19:49.913 --> 01:19:51.714]  So... Well, it is, and look...
[01:19:51.974 --> 01:19:58.937]  Obama has arrested and audited Christians that say they don't like abortion, saying they have no free speech, but a foreign religious leader is here lecturing us.
[01:19:58.937 --> 01:20:00.478]  Are you looking to sell body armor?

[01:22:27.833 --> 01:22:30.894]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:22:30.894 --> 01:22:33.515]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:34.256]  Croix River.
[01:22:34.256 --> 01:22:36.497]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:22:36.497 --> 01:22:39.458]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:40.338]  His excuse?
[01:22:40.338 --> 01:22:41.659]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:22:41.659 --> 01:22:43.279]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:22:43.279 --> 01:22:49.042]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:14.887]  Central, we're here live, broadcasting worldwide on Ammon-Avon stations.
[01:24:14.887 --> 01:24:17.868]  The Internet, global shortwave, satellite, and more.
[01:24:17.868 --> 01:24:18.869]  TV satellite, that is.
[01:24:20.265 --> 01:24:28.649]  The Washington Post and hundreds of other publications, I don't want to sound conservative, it was actually thousands the last week, have this line that he's an internet-only host.
[01:24:28.649 --> 01:24:41.635]  As if that would be bad that I was successful and that the truth was successful whether it was in a book or on the internet or in a play or, you know, what's informative is informative.
[01:24:41.635 --> 01:24:44.336]  And he has a red face.
[01:24:44.336 --> 01:24:46.257]  He had a spot on his forehead.
[01:24:46.257 --> 01:24:47.538]  They actually said that in Newsweek.
[01:24:48.635 --> 01:24:52.937]  And he said, watch out, there may not be an autopsy, and then there wasn't!
[01:24:52.937 --> 01:24:54.978]  He even questioned before it happened!
[01:24:54.978 --> 01:24:56.899]  Yeah, I smelled a rat!
[01:24:56.899 --> 01:25:02.802]  So, they're there to invert reality and train people that if you're informed and right, that's weird.
[01:25:02.802 --> 01:25:09.885]  But to have this Pope, who I've investigated deeply, who they admit basically had a blackmail coup d'etat against the Vatican and took out Ratzinger,
[01:25:13.075 --> 01:25:16.798]  Now he's in there, and he's making his move, calling for world government, you name it.
[01:25:16.798 --> 01:25:19.960]  And then Hillary praises him, and then attacks Bernie Sanders and gets booed.
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.281]  That's coming up.
[01:25:21.281 --> 01:25:27.365]  But yeah, Richard's seeing what I'm seeing, but he's in South Carolina, following it exclusively.
[01:25:27.365 --> 01:25:32.369]  I'm following nationally, but it looks like he got a boost in the polls, in his lead from this.
[01:25:32.369 --> 01:25:35.111]  So, thank you, Pope, for lecturing us.
[01:25:35.111 --> 01:25:40.095]  But I was making the point, as we went to break, Richard, they persecute the Christian Church here in America across the board.
[01:25:41.297 --> 01:25:42.878]  Unless it's leftists.
[01:25:42.878 --> 01:25:47.501]  They don't give you 501c3 or they revoke it or they audit you if you say that you don't like abortion.
[01:25:47.501 --> 01:25:48.922]  Well, that's your free speech.
[01:25:48.922 --> 01:25:53.264]  But then it's okay for the Pope to get involved in our election, though, Richard Reeves.
[01:25:53.264 --> 01:25:54.185]  No, absolutely.
[01:25:54.185 --> 01:25:57.047]  The irony is just unbelievable.
[01:25:57.047 --> 01:26:01.329]  The Pope came out yesterday and they had the little battle with Trump.
[01:26:01.329 --> 01:26:08.294]  And like I say, listening to people here on the ground, talking to people here on the ground, listening to the talk radio locally, the people were pretty offended.
[01:26:08.294 --> 01:26:10.175]  So that's just going to push more people into the
[01:26:10.635 --> 01:26:13.597]  The Trump camp and the Cruz camp, those are the big two now.
[01:26:13.597 --> 01:26:18.261]  I think that big mistake here in South Carolina last night by Marco Rubio not showing up.
[01:26:18.261 --> 01:26:21.023]  Literally, I mean, they're saying he got stuck in traffic.
[01:26:21.023 --> 01:26:23.745]  We know that, hey, how does Trey Gowdy get there?
[01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:26.227]  How does Senator Tim Scott get there?
[01:26:26.227 --> 01:26:28.609]  How does Governor Nikki Haley get there to this event?
[01:26:28.609 --> 01:26:32.592]  And then all of a sudden Marco Rubio is not there somehow when we know they're tied at the hip all day.
[01:26:33.072 --> 01:26:34.572]  So, we know that's not true.
[01:26:34.572 --> 01:26:36.293]  Supposedly, he was at a Frank Luntz event.
[01:26:36.293 --> 01:26:40.153]  We've got a helicopter coming in for a landing here at Patriot's Point.
[01:26:40.153 --> 01:26:44.314]  But, anyway, another piece of big news is Alex... Let's aim that camera.
[01:26:44.314 --> 01:26:45.354]  Let's see that while you're talking.
[01:26:45.354 --> 01:26:47.035]  We want to see that helicopter.
[01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.335]  Show them the chopper coming in.
[01:26:48.335 --> 01:26:50.535]  It's a tourist chopper.
[01:26:50.535 --> 01:26:52.716]  That's awesome.
[01:26:52.716 --> 01:26:55.296]  Man, I'll tell you, it's like HD Skype right now.
[01:26:55.296 --> 01:26:57.857]  This is a really amazing radio slash TV transmission.
[01:26:59.036 --> 01:27:00.677]  I can't believe how Infowars has grown.
[01:27:00.677 --> 01:27:01.858]  And folks, I'm not bragging here.
[01:27:01.858 --> 01:27:04.280]  I'm just marveling at what you, the listeners, have built.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.521]  Spreading the word, your support.
[01:27:05.521 --> 01:27:07.582]  You are this operation.
[01:27:07.582 --> 01:27:10.004]  And I'm not just saying that to pat you on the head.
[01:27:10.004 --> 01:27:11.605]  I mean, you are it.
[01:27:11.605 --> 01:27:13.787]  Richard, I don't know if the listeners understand how important they are.
[01:27:13.787 --> 01:27:16.689]  He came here with a helicopter.
[01:27:16.689 --> 01:27:18.030]  Ask me one more time there.
[01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.770]  No, no, Richard.
[01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:22.253]  Any other key points you want to make about South Carolina and what the numbers seem to be right now?
[01:27:22.952 --> 01:27:27.696]  Well, I think that Trump, plus or minus 40 percent, is going to be the winner.
[01:27:27.696 --> 01:27:29.678]  Cruz, second place somewhere.
[01:27:29.678 --> 01:27:32.441]  Marco Rubio, I think he might have been able to challenge Cruz.
[01:27:32.441 --> 01:27:37.546]  I think with last night's episode and what they call the upstate of South Carolina, I think that that's going to hurt him bad.
[01:27:37.546 --> 01:27:42.931]  I think literally, I think literally we will be able to look at a South Carolina county by county
[01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:44.331]  I think so.
[01:28:09.821 --> 01:28:15.846]  You've been rising up in polls until the endorsement's correct, so the kiss of death is the establishment endorsing you, right?
[01:28:15.846 --> 01:28:17.828]  Well, you know, Nikki Haley endorsed him.
[01:28:17.828 --> 01:28:20.491]  It was actually, it wasn't good for Rubio necessarily.
[01:28:20.491 --> 01:28:23.173]  It helped him a little bit, but I'll tell you who it was the kiss of death for.
[01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:24.774]  I can tell you exactly who it was.
[01:28:24.774 --> 01:28:27.097]  It was the kiss of death for Bush.
[01:28:27.097 --> 01:28:28.738]  It was the kiss of death for Jeb Bush.
[01:28:28.738 --> 01:28:30.059]  They were counting.
[01:28:30.059 --> 01:28:34.944]  They were praying and hoping and counting and doing their Hail Marys and counting their rosary trying to get
[01:28:35.544 --> 01:28:39.445]  The endorsement of Nikki Haley for the Jeb camp, and it didn't happen.
[01:28:39.445 --> 01:28:46.648]  So ironically, and just complete irony, Nikki Haley might be the nail in the coffin for the Bush dynasty.
[01:28:46.648 --> 01:28:47.088]  I agree with you.
[01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:48.129]  We got one minute left, Richard.
[01:28:48.129 --> 01:28:49.609]  I'm going to let you get back on the trail.
[01:28:49.609 --> 01:28:50.469]  So much is happening.
[01:28:50.469 --> 01:28:51.810]  What other tidbits do you have for us?
[01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:55.629]  Well, we are working on that delegate story.
[01:28:55.629 --> 01:29:00.932]  As Roger said just earlier in the show, look out, the delegate strategy is in full play.
[01:29:00.932 --> 01:29:02.172]  We'll especially see it.
[01:29:02.172 --> 01:29:04.574]  Oh, and another thing, he talked about Nevada.
[01:29:04.574 --> 01:29:05.775]  Nevada is very important.
[01:29:05.775 --> 01:29:07.816]  InfoWarriors, you know the Ron Paulers.
[01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:12.859]  Cause so much, they almost took over Nevada in 2012, Alex.
[01:29:12.859 --> 01:29:22.727]  They need to show up because what happened is they couldn't even complete their convention in 2012 because the Ron Paulers were just like 48% or 51, they were real close to being the majority.
[01:29:22.727 --> 01:29:27.351]  So the establishment just shut down the convention and I don't even know what the outcome was.
[01:29:27.351 --> 01:29:29.012]  That's right, it's a hanky panky.
[01:29:29.372 --> 01:29:32.034]  That we've seen in the last two primaries we're going to be watching.
[01:29:32.034 --> 01:29:38.360]  Richard Reeves is going to be there tonight, tomorrow, Sunday on the Sunday Show, covering it all, and reports at Infowars.com.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.921]  Godspeed Richard, great job.
[01:29:39.921 --> 01:29:46.046]  We'll be right back on the other side to look at the worldwide financial meltdown that is accelerating with Peter Schiff.
[01:29:46.046 --> 01:29:48.008]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:51.931]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.931 --> 01:29:54.594]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.328 --> 01:30:06.530]  I'm George Washington and I try not to tell lies.
[01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:08.592]  Leanne McAdoo with InfoWars.com.
[01:30:08.592 --> 01:30:10.313]  Let me level with you, America.
[01:30:10.313 --> 01:30:13.035]  Here's just a small sampling of Hillary's whoppers.
[01:30:13.035 --> 01:30:20.941]  There's the Benghazi hearing, using a secret private server to hide her activities, lying about not sharing classified information on that secret server.
[01:30:21.221 --> 01:30:26.165]  Using the Clinton Foundation as a cover for tax evasion and taking bribes from foreign countries.
[01:30:26.165 --> 01:30:33.591]  She claims to be against the big banks, but won't release transcripts of the speeches she made to those banks who paid her hefty speaking fees.
[01:30:33.591 --> 01:30:42.337]  Whitewater, Watergate, defending a rapist, threatening all of Bill's bimbos in an effort to keep them quiet, then claiming to run a campaign for women.
[01:30:42.337 --> 01:30:49.002]  Clinton even took $190,000 worth of household goods from the White House when Bill left office.
[01:30:49.002 --> 01:30:50.624]  I guess they were dead broke at the time.

[01:30:58.550 --> 01:31:02.072]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[01:31:58.354 --> 01:32:01.556]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:32:01.556 --> 01:32:03.917]  Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:03.917 --> 01:32:10.920]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[01:32:25.666 --> 01:32:34.531]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:32:34.531 --> 01:32:41.636]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.

[01:32:47.139 --> 01:32:48.059]  Big Brother.
[01:32:48.059 --> 01:32:48.720]  Mainstream media.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.260]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:12.595 --> 01:33:14.496]  You want answers?
[01:33:14.496 --> 01:33:16.437]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:16.437 --> 01:33:24.041]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.041 --> 01:33:37.088]  I could get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of brokerage firm owners and economists and people that go on CNBC or Fox Business on this show all day, but most of them are wrong about 80% of the time.
[01:33:37.088 --> 01:33:41.030]  Because I do watch those shows, but it's just like amateurish compared to what
[01:33:42.111 --> 01:33:43.533]  People could be hearing.
[01:33:43.533 --> 01:33:47.659]  Now, Peter Schiff goes on a lot of those shows, and when he does, he's usually the odd man out.
[01:33:47.659 --> 01:33:55.870]  But when I have somebody on like a Harry Dent or a Peter Schiff or a Max Keiser, you know, they're right like 80 to 90% of the time or more.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.664]  And the media makes a huge deal of it when they're wrong, you know, 5-10% of the time, on average.
[01:34:01.664 --> 01:34:03.285]  Maybe every once in a while 10% wrong.
[01:34:03.285 --> 01:34:04.526]  Because I've really been following this.
[01:34:04.526 --> 01:34:05.747]  I read the financial papers.
[01:34:05.747 --> 01:34:08.630]  I track what's happening.
[01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:12.333]  Mainstream media doesn't want to tell you the truth, in my experience.
[01:34:12.333 --> 01:34:19.759]  And it's rewarded a fantasy land for so long that a lot of people, I think, are drinking their own Kool-Aid and really believe the Kinsey and economics they push.
[01:34:20.823 --> 01:34:28.287]  I'm not saying Austrian economics is perfect, no model is, but it makes a lot more sense from what I've seen historically than what they're shoveling at us.
[01:34:28.287 --> 01:34:37.331]  So, I gotta say, one of the only things Schiff was quasi, I guess you could say wrong about, was he kept saying gold's gonna go up, gold's gonna go up probably, and it has now.
[01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:45.392]  But he was right about what was going to happen, how things would unfold, what he thought they'd do with rates, a small cut, and then maybe try to go back.
[01:34:45.392 --> 01:34:46.492]  It's all happening.
[01:34:46.492 --> 01:34:56.156]  So I don't know who's more accurate, Dent or Shipp, it doesn't matter because they're more generally accurate in a whole other universe than
[01:34:57.694 --> 01:34:58.314]  The other people.
[01:34:58.314 --> 01:35:02.376]  I mean, like, Iran Paul is more accurate by light years than the competition.
[01:35:02.376 --> 01:35:07.858]  So we're going to be talking to him about all these huge developments, where he sees the economy going now.
[01:35:07.858 --> 01:35:09.038]  Really, how bad is it?
[01:35:09.038 --> 01:35:13.820]  Because they've been saying everything's fine for years when it's been going to the crapper.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.980]  And the water's rising.
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:17.781]  We're like one of the highest islands, but still it's rising.
[01:35:17.781 --> 01:35:18.922]  Some countries are underwater.
[01:35:20.031 --> 01:35:21.332]  What does he think is coming next?
[01:35:21.332 --> 01:35:24.855]  We're going to talk to Peter Schiff here in just a moment from Europack.com.
[01:35:24.855 --> 01:35:30.359]  No stranger to this show or pretty much anybody out there, so there's no need to go over his bio for you, but he has billions under management.
[01:35:30.359 --> 01:35:34.383]  His father is a very famous political prisoner who died last year.
[01:35:34.383 --> 01:35:35.544]  Very, very sad.
[01:35:35.544 --> 01:35:36.605]  But before we go any further,
[01:35:37.958 --> 01:35:51.068]  Supramel Vitality is just known concentrated herbs that basically from Dr. Grimm's research, all I know is it works, blocks a lot of the estrogen mimickers and just stimulates your natural glands.
[01:35:51.068 --> 01:35:54.431]  It doesn't simulate testosterone or other things, it just stimulates your glands.
[01:35:54.431 --> 01:35:57.413]  That's why I've lost so much weight, I've gotten so healthy.
[01:35:57.413 --> 01:36:00.276]  It's just amazing with this and the other products and in fullworldslife.com.
[01:36:01.158 --> 01:36:01.938]  Here's the problem.
[01:36:01.938 --> 01:36:04.379]  It will be sold out at current sales rates by tomorrow.
[01:36:04.379 --> 01:36:05.500]  So the special ends now.
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:06.640]  20% off is now over.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:11.082]  It'll be sold out guaranteed in the next few days, even though I've raised the price back up to normal.
[01:36:11.082 --> 01:36:13.262]  I'm a capitalist and we need the funding to operate.
[01:36:13.262 --> 01:36:14.363]  I'm not ashamed of that.
[01:36:14.363 --> 01:36:19.525]  Super female, 20% off is still there because we've got a decent supply of that at least a few weeks.
[01:36:19.525 --> 01:36:23.866]  Super male could be out for months because these are wet herbs.
[01:36:23.866 --> 01:36:24.906]  They're cold pressed.
[01:36:24.906 --> 01:36:26.847]  They're very hard to source.
[01:36:26.847 --> 01:36:29.148]  Believe me, we'd rather just have stuff in stock all the time.
[01:36:31.081 --> 01:36:34.063]  It is available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:36:34.063 --> 01:36:36.084]  Also, AndroPlex is selling out.
[01:36:36.084 --> 01:36:37.465]  You'll have to sign up for AutoShip.
[01:36:37.465 --> 01:36:38.765]  You'll get 10% off.
[01:36:38.765 --> 01:36:44.088]  We're holding some back for folks that are in AutoShip, because once you have AutoShip, you can't ever sell out.
[01:36:44.088 --> 01:36:48.391]  So now we have to always hold back whatever amount of people are signed up for something on AutoShip.
[01:36:48.991 --> 01:36:52.494]  So, by tomorrow, the only way to get anthroplex will be via auto-ship.
[01:36:52.494 --> 01:36:53.915]  You'll still get 10% off.
[01:36:53.915 --> 01:36:59.380]  It's similar to Supermail, but has some different factors, and it's kind of a base for the Supermail or Superfemale.
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:06.205]  Also, the big liver cleanse, we have informational videos about it, with the oxy powder and the apple cider vinegar that we don't sell.
[01:37:06.205 --> 01:37:12.030]  You take that for a week, we have the formula up there, and just most people, I'd say 99%, you've seen the 4.8 star reviews.
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:17.000]  Have explosive results.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.761]  When I say explosive, I mean there's a lot of stuff in the gallbladder and the liver.
[01:37:20.761 --> 01:37:22.762]  And, boy, did it work for me.
[01:37:22.762 --> 01:37:23.782]  Lee Ann McAdoo and others.
[01:37:23.782 --> 01:37:26.783]  Rob Dew lost 12 pounds of detritus that was in him.

[01:37:30.184 --> 01:37:32.425]  It's been out of stock for two months.
[01:37:32.425 --> 01:37:33.925]  And it's back.
[01:37:33.925 --> 01:37:36.306]  And check out the Advanced Liver Cleanse as well.
[01:37:37.332 --> 01:37:43.034]  Now, Peter Schiff, one of the most accurate people in my 20 years on air.
[01:37:43.034 --> 01:37:55.377]  I mean, I remember in the last 15 years or so seeing him on CNBC and Fox Business and stuff, but very accurate, predicted a lot of things, went contrarian to the system, and he's been saying, hey, this is going to melt down, this isn't going to work.
[01:37:55.377 --> 01:38:00.399]  QE, you know, he predicted that they would just do a small increase, he predicted when they would do it.
[01:38:00.839 --> 01:38:02.039]  He's made a lot of accurate predictions.
[01:38:02.039 --> 01:38:10.602]  He doesn't want to shoot his horn, but I think it's important if he goes over those for new listeners, because so many new TV stations and radio stations are picking his stuff that may not watch the financial shows.
[01:38:10.602 --> 01:38:17.744]  And then, what he predicted in the collapse is now beginning to come true, and how bad he really thinks it is versus what they're saying.
[01:38:17.744 --> 01:38:18.744]  I have a lot of questions.
[01:38:18.744 --> 01:38:20.105]  I want to move quick with him.
[01:38:20.105 --> 01:38:21.365]  Europac.com.
[01:38:21.365 --> 01:38:23.406]  Peter, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:38:23.406 --> 01:38:24.726]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:38:24.726 --> 01:38:25.707]  Where do you want to start?
[01:38:25.707 --> 01:38:26.907]  I mean, there's just so much happening.
[01:38:27.850 --> 01:38:42.656]  Yeah, you know, all the things that I've been talking about both on your program and, you know, my own internet program, The Peter Schiff Show, or whatever they will occasionally invite me on, you know, conventional television, you know, all this stuff is now starting to happen.
[01:38:42.656 --> 01:38:44.177]  It's starting to unfold.
[01:38:44.177 --> 01:38:46.778]  The mainstream still doesn't understand.
[01:38:46.778 --> 01:38:49.379]  They still think, oh, maybe the Fed made a mistake.
[01:38:49.379 --> 01:38:51.439]  Maybe they shouldn't have raised rates.
[01:38:51.439 --> 01:38:52.900]  That wasn't a mistake.
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:56.341]  The mistake was lowering them to zero in the first place.
[01:38:56.341 --> 01:38:57.382]  The minute they did that,
[01:38:58.022 --> 01:38:59.063]  They sealed our fate.
[01:38:59.063 --> 01:39:01.164]  It didn't matter when they raised rates.
[01:39:01.164 --> 01:39:03.966]  The minute they would do it, everything was going to fall apart.
[01:39:03.966 --> 01:39:06.428]  Because this was a phony recovery, it was a bubble.
[01:39:06.428 --> 01:39:13.133]  And the fact that they waited so long means that the bubble is that much bigger, which means it's that much more problematic when it pops.
[01:39:13.533 --> 01:39:26.478]  I think what we're staring at right now, unless the Fed quickly backtracks and cuts rates and does QE4, which I think they're going to do, they may even go negative, but I think we're going to have a worse financial crisis than the one we had in 2008.
[01:39:26.478 --> 01:39:39.144]  But if the Fed does what I think it's going to do to try to prevent that crisis, then they're actually going to usher in something much worse in the form of a dollar crisis, which is going to be much worse than just a general financial crisis.
[01:39:39.932 --> 01:40:02.829]  They could finally kill the dollar, because the conventional wisdom is that we're the worst, we're the best house in a bad neighborhood, but at the same time, it's got to give someday, and it just can't go on forever, and it appears that's beginning to crack with all the big banks and the Royal Bank of Scotland and Soros saying, panic, it's over, everything's going to collapse.
[01:40:02.829 --> 01:40:05.852]  It almost makes me then ask, what do they think they're doing?
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:07.781]  Well, they have no idea.
[01:40:07.781 --> 01:40:24.129]  But, you know, the only reason that the dollar has risen these past several years, although it's now falling so far in 2016, but the reason it rose is because everybody was convinced that what the Fed did actually worked, that we had a real recovery, and that the Fed was going to be able to raise rates.
[01:40:24.429 --> 01:40:30.054]  I knew all along that that wasn't true, and I actually thought the Federal Reserve was smart enough not to raise rates.
[01:40:30.054 --> 01:40:35.178]  But they proved me wrong on that, because they were dumb enough to think that they can get away with a quarter point hike.
[01:40:35.178 --> 01:40:40.002]  I knew that wouldn't be the case, and now they've pricked their own bubble, and the air is coming out of it.
[01:40:40.002 --> 01:40:41.924]  And, you know, that's why you talk about gold.
[01:40:41.924 --> 01:40:45.667]  The only reason gold was falling was because people believed in this myth.
[01:40:46.107 --> 01:40:53.248]  Now that we're looking behind the curtain, gold is off to its best annual start in the history of gold.
[01:40:53.248 --> 01:40:58.009]  Gold is now at about $1,230 an ounce, a little bit more.
[01:40:58.009 --> 01:41:01.450]  It was at $1,050 the day after the Fed raised rates.
[01:41:01.450 --> 01:41:09.411]  And in fact, just yesterday, one of the biggest gold bearers, this analyst over at ABN Ambro, she had a price target for gold in 2016 of $900.
[01:41:09.411 --> 01:41:10.391]  She just changed it yesterday from $900 to $1,300.
[01:41:15.692 --> 01:41:26.382]  Now that's a pretty big about-face for a major bank, and the reason she said that she did this is her case for lower gold prices was based on the Fed raising rates.
[01:41:26.382 --> 01:41:32.208]  She now believes that the Fed's not going to raise rates at all in 2016, and so now she thinks gold's going to... Sure, sure.
[01:41:32.208 --> 01:41:36.292]  What do you say to people like Dent, who's been, you know, really accurate on a lot of fronts, saying,
[01:41:37.413 --> 01:41:40.514]  It's going to end up going down because it's not even really a commodity.
[01:41:40.514 --> 01:41:42.095]  It's basically worthless.
[01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:47.017]  I disagree with him on some of those fronts, even though I know he's really smart, because it is a commodity.
[01:41:47.017 --> 01:41:48.678]  It is industrially used.
[01:41:48.678 --> 01:41:52.880]  It's seen culturally also as a hedge against inflation or emergency.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.882]  Big governments, large populations, China, India, Mexico,
[01:41:57.802 --> 01:41:58.323]  Or buying it?
[01:42:14.196 --> 01:42:17.059]  And we have governments threatening to outlaw cash.
[01:42:17.059 --> 01:42:20.202]  They want to do away with the $100 bill or the 500 euro bill.
[01:42:20.202 --> 01:42:21.764]  That's the next place I was going.
[01:42:21.764 --> 01:42:26.028]  I mean, this will be all we have as a true barter currency.
[01:42:26.028 --> 01:42:28.090]  It'll force us back to a real currency.
[01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:29.011]  That was my next question.
[01:42:29.471 --> 01:42:37.557]  I've never seen a push by the European Central Bank and by Larry Summers and by the big five banks to get rid of cash, to make us go all digital.
[01:42:37.557 --> 01:42:39.559]  What is that really about, Mr. Schiff?
[01:42:39.559 --> 01:42:41.400]  Well, it's all about control.
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:44.022]  It's about a loss of financial privacy.
[01:42:44.022 --> 01:42:45.683]  It's about a loss of freedom.
[01:42:45.683 --> 01:42:48.666]  And it's about being able to debase the money.
[01:42:48.666 --> 01:42:56.371]  See, the problem with negative interest rates right now is, well, I'll just take my money out of the bank and put it in my mattress and I avoid the negative rate.
[01:42:56.371 --> 01:42:58.273]  Well, if they make that impossible, if it's a
[01:42:58.553 --> 01:43:04.519]  Either you put it in the bank, or you don't have it, then it's stuck there, and then you can lose money with negative rates.
[01:43:04.519 --> 01:43:12.706]  And it's also about them being able to do bail-ins, or tax your money, or basically nationalize it, which they've done in Europe over and over again.
[01:43:12.706 --> 01:43:18.192]  I mean, the big kahuna of tyranny we've always known is getting rid of cash, and boy, they're sure pushing it.
[01:43:18.852 --> 01:43:20.453]  And what about the underground economy?
[01:43:20.453 --> 01:43:24.034]  The underground economy is not going to go away if they take away cash.
[01:43:24.034 --> 01:43:26.554]  They're just going to have to find an alternative to cash.
[01:43:26.554 --> 01:43:29.095]  And what's the oldest alternative available?
[01:43:29.095 --> 01:43:29.775]  Gold!
[01:43:29.775 --> 01:43:30.216]  That's a great point.
[01:43:30.216 --> 01:43:30.676]  Gold and silver.
[01:43:30.676 --> 01:43:32.236]  I mean, what are people going to use?
[01:43:32.236 --> 01:43:34.937]  People are going to go back to real money, traditional money.
[01:43:34.937 --> 01:43:38.738]  This experiment in fiat money is blowing up all around us.
[01:43:38.738 --> 01:43:46.541]  And it's ironic that probably just before the greatest bull market in the history of gold, you had so much negativity.
[01:43:46.541 --> 01:43:46.901]  In fact,
[01:43:47.381 --> 01:43:51.383]  Just about all the hedge funds at the end of last year were short gold.
[01:43:51.383 --> 01:43:55.666]  I mean, it was the first time in history that hedge funds were next short gold.
[01:43:55.666 --> 01:43:57.267]  Look at what these geniuses did.
[01:43:57.267 --> 01:44:01.629]  They were all short gold, below $1,100, and look where it is now.
[01:44:01.629 --> 01:44:03.210]  I mean, everything they bought has gone down.
[01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:04.410]  Wow, I didn't think of that!
[01:44:23.817 --> 01:44:26.979]  Because, as you know, you talked about this a decade ago.
[01:44:26.979 --> 01:44:29.840]  Ron Paul's talked about it.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:33.962]  So many folks have talked about the manipulation of the gold and silver markets.
[01:44:33.962 --> 01:44:35.983]  It's now come out they've been doing that.
[01:44:35.983 --> 01:44:38.684]  And look at Goldman Sachs.
[01:44:38.684 --> 01:44:42.286]  Goldman Sachs is desperately trying to encourage everybody to short gold.
[01:44:42.286 --> 01:44:44.026]  They've been coming out several times.
[01:44:44.026 --> 01:44:47.368]  Not only are they telling people to sell gold, they're telling them to short it.
[01:44:47.368 --> 01:44:48.328]  They're saying it's going to 1100.
[01:44:48.328 --> 01:44:50.449]  How long can they suppress it?
[01:44:50.449 --> 01:44:51.590]  How long can they suppress it?
[01:44:52.190 --> 01:44:56.115]  Well look, obviously not long this whole fantasy is evaporating.
[01:44:56.115 --> 01:44:57.897]  It's falling apart before their eyes.
[01:44:57.897 --> 01:44:59.699]  They're desperate to try to do something.
[01:44:59.699 --> 01:45:01.441]  They want to talk the price down.
[01:45:01.441 --> 01:45:02.943]  But you know, the truth is out.
[01:45:02.943 --> 01:45:05.806]  They raised interest rates now by a tiny little bit.
[01:45:05.806 --> 01:45:06.768]  And what do we have?
[01:45:06.768 --> 01:45:09.671]  The worst start in history of the stock market.
[01:45:10.512 --> 01:45:11.593]  Well, let me just add this.
[01:45:11.593 --> 01:45:19.278]  I haven't sold one piece of gold or silver that I've bought in 25 years, and my gut tells me stuff I bought at $300, I kept it when I went to $2,000.
[01:45:19.278 --> 01:45:21.720]  It goes down to $1,000, I don't care.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.442]  This whole paper fraud is garbage.
[01:45:24.442 --> 01:45:33.409]  The enemies of freedom lie about it constantly, and so I know it's there as an emergency backup, and my gut tells me I did the right thing.
[01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:35.790]  But then I talk to people like Dent.
[01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:37.391]  To be fair, he didn't say it was worthless.
[01:45:37.391 --> 01:45:39.072]  He just said it's overvalued.
[01:45:39.072 --> 01:45:41.453]  He's right on so many things.
[01:45:41.453 --> 01:45:43.294]  He's wrong on that, though.
[01:45:43.294 --> 01:45:48.036]  He's wrong on that because he somehow believes that it's all going to fall apart, the U.S.
[01:45:48.036 --> 01:45:52.138]  is going to collapse, and the dollar is somehow going to gain value in that environment.
[01:45:52.138 --> 01:45:53.599]  That makes no sense.
[01:45:53.599 --> 01:46:00.202]  That's like telling me that a corporation is about to go bankrupt, but I should buy shares in the company because the stock price is going to go up.
[01:46:00.202 --> 01:46:01.322]  Well, he says it's the...
[01:46:02.503 --> 01:46:05.787]  Best house in a bad neighborhood, and so far that's been happening.
[01:46:05.787 --> 01:46:08.350]  It's not the best house, it's actually the worst house.
[01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:14.838]  The only reason that people perceive it to be good is because it's been a self-fulfilling prophecy and people have believed all the hype.
[01:46:14.838 --> 01:46:16.020]  Confidence game.
[01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:21.927]  Well you know the guy that brought down Madoff, the guy that brought down Madoff says there's three bigger scams right now that he's investigating.
[01:46:22.793 --> 01:46:25.315]  Yeah, well, you know, but we pierced the illusion.
[01:46:25.315 --> 01:46:27.578]  We pretended that we can raise interest rates.
[01:46:27.578 --> 01:46:35.585]  I said many times on your show, the Fed needed to talk about raising interest rates to pretend that they could do it, but not actually do it and prove that they couldn't.
[01:46:35.585 --> 01:46:38.068]  Well, we just raised interest rates a quarter point
[01:46:38.388 --> 01:46:39.769]  And all hell is breaking loose.
[01:46:39.769 --> 01:46:44.734]  If you look at the banking sector, it hasn't been this stressed since before the 2008 financial crisis.
[01:46:44.734 --> 01:46:45.434]  That's my next question.
[01:46:45.434 --> 01:46:46.595]  You're getting into all the technicals.
[01:46:46.595 --> 01:46:50.358]  You did call it just exactly the whole time with QE and what would happen.
[01:46:50.358 --> 01:46:51.920]  Tell us next.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:54.582]  And I'm not disagreeing with you, but somebody like Dent says the U.S.
[01:46:54.582 --> 01:46:56.223]  is great, China is bad.
[01:46:56.223 --> 01:46:57.745]  China's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:46:57.745 --> 01:46:59.967]  You a lot of times say China's better than the U.S.
[01:46:59.967 --> 01:47:03.069]  China set the ban all foreign media from publishing online.
[01:47:03.069 --> 01:47:04.631]  That's the independent.
[01:47:04.631 --> 01:47:06.152]  China obviously has seen a third of
[01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:15.400]  Yeah, look, well what does China produce?
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:19.343]  They produce all sorts of products that everybody in the world wants to consume.
[01:47:19.343 --> 01:47:21.445]  We have a huge trade deficit with China.
[01:47:21.445 --> 01:47:22.866]  It's not the other way around.
[01:47:22.866 --> 01:47:24.687]  All we produce is treasury bonds.
[01:47:24.687 --> 01:47:25.608]  We go into debt.
[01:47:25.608 --> 01:47:30.512]  We borrow money to buy the things that the Chinese economy is productive enough to create.
[01:47:30.512 --> 01:47:32.414]  So we're the country that's in a lot more trouble.
[01:47:32.614 --> 01:47:33.434]  Not China.
[01:47:33.434 --> 01:47:35.195]  They're the ones that have been loaning us money.
[01:47:35.195 --> 01:47:39.717]  They're the ones who have been, you know, allowing us to have all the stuff that they produce.
[01:47:39.717 --> 01:47:43.579]  So I think that people who are worried about China are missing the bigger picture.
[01:47:43.579 --> 01:47:46.761]  China has problems, but our problems are much larger.
[01:47:46.761 --> 01:47:50.102]  Sure, he thought China would be the detonator, but isn't the argument really the detonator?
[01:47:50.102 --> 01:47:55.105]  And I think he says this too, and you say this, is the QE unlimited?
[01:47:56.286 --> 01:48:04.753]  Oh yeah, and you know a lot of these hedge funds that were shorting gold, or different hedge funds now are shorting the Chinese currency, the yuan, because they think it's going to collapse.
[01:48:04.753 --> 01:48:07.495]  But it's actually the dollar that's going to collapse, not the yuan.
[01:48:07.495 --> 01:48:07.896]  Good God.
[01:48:07.896 --> 01:48:12.600]  Because it's been the idea that we can raise interest rates that has supported the dollar.
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:12.800]  Sure.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.303]  This is the biggest bubble the Federal Reserve has ever inflated.
[01:48:16.303 --> 01:48:16.723]  The U.S.
[01:48:16.723 --> 01:48:18.785]  economy is in worse shape than it's ever been.
[01:48:18.785 --> 01:48:21.887]  We doubled the national debt since the financial crisis.
[01:48:21.887 --> 01:48:22.508]  You're not being negative.
[01:48:22.508 --> 01:48:23.008]  These are facts.
[01:48:23.008 --> 01:48:23.709]  So let me ask you this.
[01:48:25.331 --> 01:48:27.424]  You know, as a father talking to a father.
[01:48:27.424 --> 01:48:27.645]  Okay?
[01:48:29.770 --> 01:48:31.390]  What do you really think is going to happen?
[01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:35.051]  I know it's not a prediction, but obviously we have another Great Depression.
[01:48:35.051 --> 01:48:36.871]  People are going to kill each other.
[01:48:36.871 --> 01:48:38.251]  I mean, we're not as moral as we were.
[01:48:38.251 --> 01:48:39.432]  People were hardworking.
[01:48:39.432 --> 01:48:40.592]  They knew how to plant a garden.
[01:48:40.592 --> 01:48:47.873]  And still, 7 million people, major university studies show, died in association of malnutrition or from illnesses from malnutrition.
[01:48:47.873 --> 01:48:50.293]  Basically, 7 million people died in a famine in the U.S.
[01:48:50.293 --> 01:48:51.694]  over that 10 years.
[01:48:51.694 --> 01:48:53.874]  It was quietly dealt with.
[01:48:53.874 --> 01:48:55.034]  It was very, very sad.
[01:48:55.034 --> 01:48:56.335]  Europe, tens of millions.
[01:48:56.335 --> 01:48:58.695]  What is going to happen if we have a real depression here?
[01:48:59.355 --> 01:49:00.915]  With this spoiled rotten population?
[01:49:00.915 --> 01:49:02.636]  I mean, I am actually scared.
[01:49:02.636 --> 01:49:09.277]  Well, this could be a lot worse, because during the Depression in America, we were still a relatively free, prosperous economy.
[01:49:09.277 --> 01:49:11.038]  We had lots of individual rights.
[01:49:11.038 --> 01:49:12.158]  Government was tiny.
[01:49:12.158 --> 01:49:13.178]  We had sound money.
[01:49:13.178 --> 01:49:14.959]  We were on the gold standard.
[01:49:14.959 --> 01:49:17.019]  And we had the benefit of falling prices.
[01:49:17.019 --> 01:49:19.140]  Everybody wants to talk about how bad deflation is.
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.841]  Look, deflation is great.
[01:49:20.841 --> 01:49:26.743]  You're unemployed, and the cost of food is going down, and your rent is going down, and your utility bills are going down.
[01:49:26.743 --> 01:49:28.483]  That's all good news, right?
[01:49:28.483 --> 01:49:33.285]  Americans aren't going to be that fortunate this time, because we're going to see massive increases in consumer prices.
[01:49:33.285 --> 01:49:34.405]  No, it's hell on earth.
[01:49:34.405 --> 01:49:44.949]  I mean, look, the Pentagon says it, the Ministry of Defense in their reports that we've covered say it, that when there's a financial meltdown, they say between 2016 and 2020, this was put out in 2007, Leningradian, go look it up, folks.
[01:49:45.569 --> 01:49:49.851]  They say it could be road warrior level is one of the quotes in the Pentagon report.
[01:49:49.851 --> 01:49:59.997]  I mean, I don't know if it's going to get that bad, but the societal issue of all these spoiled rotten brats that think everything is entitled to them under socialism and a crazy like Bernie Sanders.
[01:50:00.777 --> 01:50:02.558]  I mean, is this not the perfect storm, sir?
[01:50:02.558 --> 01:50:03.299]  What do you think?
[01:50:03.299 --> 01:50:08.222]  Oh yeah, this is the reason that the founding fathers detested democracy so much.
[01:50:08.222 --> 01:50:11.044]  They wanted to protect us from things like Bernie Sanders.
[01:50:11.044 --> 01:50:17.309]  But look, I don't know how bad it's going to get, but I don't want to find out, you know, holding dollars.
[01:50:17.309 --> 01:50:24.674]  I don't want to have my life savings, my retirement accounts in a currency that can be almost completely worthless in a worst-case scenario.
[01:50:24.674 --> 01:50:28.617]  Even in a best-case scenario, the dollar is going to lose the majority of its purchasing power.
[01:50:28.837 --> 01:50:30.157]  There's no way out of this.
[01:50:30.157 --> 01:50:39.499]  Peter Stanton, I'm going to come back with one more segment, and one more if you can, you probably got to go, but I want to really drill into this best case scenario, worst case scenario, and what you're doing.
[01:50:39.499 --> 01:50:48.481]  I mean, seriously, folks, I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm thinking about getting a farmhouse with an armored 20-foot wall, you know, and I mean, seriously, I mean, this is just out of control.
[01:50:48.481 --> 01:50:53.142]  If you study this and what the real experts say versus the media, this is dangerous.
[01:50:53.142 --> 01:50:53.522]  We'll be back.
[01:50:58.823 --> 01:51:08.265]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[01:53:29.627 --> 01:53:31.087]  You've heard about bunkers.
[01:53:31.087 --> 01:53:33.828]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:53:33.828 --> 01:53:36.589]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[01:54:01.994 --> 01:54:03.835]  I hear the train a-comin'.
[01:54:03.835 --> 01:54:05.936]  I hear the train a-comin'.
[01:54:05.936 --> 01:54:08.178]  It's rollin' around the bend.
[01:54:08.178 --> 01:54:15.562]  And I ain't seen the sunshine since... You know those folks aren't calling Peter Schiff, myself, Ron Paul, fairmongers anymore.
[01:54:15.562 --> 01:54:22.266]  I mean, you can't just print unlimited money and give it to the elites forever and not have it cause big problems.
[01:54:22.266 --> 01:54:26.249]  So in the six minutes we have, the next five minutes that Mr. Schiff's with us, I'm gonna try to shut up here.
[01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:35.376]  And let him break down where he thinks this is going, how bad it's going to get, what he's doing to protect himself, and what some of the other big hot spots are.
[01:54:35.376 --> 01:54:41.742]  And then the next segment, I want to briefly ask him about the campaigns, about the Pope weighing in on politics, where he sees all that going as well.
[01:54:41.742 --> 01:54:49.869]  But getting back to the head of Euro-specific capital, and I'll also give folks that website and put that up on screen.
[01:54:49.869 --> 01:54:51.130]  Peter, continue where we left off.
[01:54:52.008 --> 01:54:54.869]  You know, it's amazing how often history repeats.
[01:54:54.869 --> 01:54:56.250]  You know, even recent history.
[01:54:56.250 --> 01:55:02.592]  Because the last financial crisis happened in the final year of Bush's second term.
[01:55:02.592 --> 01:55:04.433]  And the same thing is about to happen again.
[01:55:04.433 --> 01:55:07.114]  It's the final year of Obama's second term.
[01:55:07.114 --> 01:55:16.157]  And the bubble that the central banks have created during the Obama administration is much bigger than the one that we inflated during the Bush administration.
[01:55:16.157 --> 01:55:19.058]  And if you remember, in early 2008, in February 2008, all the experts were unanimous.
[01:55:21.579 --> 01:55:22.460]  Everything was great.
[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:22.740]  The U.S.
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:24.741]  economy was in good shape.
[01:55:24.741 --> 01:55:25.722]  Nothing to worry about.
[01:55:25.722 --> 01:55:30.185]  And then a few months later, we had the financial crisis and, you know, all hell broke loose.
[01:55:30.185 --> 01:55:32.426]  And now the same thing is happening again.
[01:55:32.426 --> 01:55:40.191]  Because we didn't let the free market solve the problems that the Federal Reserve created, we now have exacerbated all those problems.
[01:55:40.191 --> 01:55:42.993]  We now have an even bigger economic crisis around the corner.
[01:55:42.993 --> 01:55:45.215]  And the same experts who were oblivious before
[01:55:45.635 --> 01:55:47.495]  Are still telling us that everything is fine.
[01:55:47.495 --> 01:55:48.476]  There's nothing to worry about.
[01:55:48.476 --> 01:55:55.077]  In fact, the Fed was so convinced we're in such great shape that they actually raised interest rates in December and everybody applauded.
[01:55:55.077 --> 01:55:56.557]  Everybody said, well, this is fantastic.
[01:55:56.557 --> 01:55:58.978]  This proves that the crisis is over.
[01:55:58.978 --> 01:56:01.878]  Well, we're about to launch this crisis into a whole new gear.
[01:56:01.878 --> 01:56:06.339]  What you saw in 2008 was a Sunday school picnic compared to what's coming up right now.
[01:56:06.339 --> 01:56:11.740]  And I think what we're going to have this time again is a currency crisis because I don't think they're going to let it get
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:14.902]  to a repeat of 2008 in this election year.
[01:56:14.902 --> 01:56:21.667]  I think they're getting ready to pull out the stops with 0%, maybe negative rates, QE4, who knows what these guys are going to do.
[01:56:21.667 --> 01:56:23.848]  But it's going to destroy the value of the dollar.
[01:56:23.848 --> 01:56:30.413]  Hopefully, hopefully it won't be a worst case scenario, which is hyperinflation, where the currency is completely worthless.
[01:56:30.413 --> 01:56:34.636]  Hopefully they figure out their mistakes before we go that far down the line.
[01:56:34.636 --> 01:56:38.699]  But don't wait, you know, don't wait to find out how much value the dollar loses.
[01:56:39.059 --> 01:56:40.339]  You need to get rid of your dollars now.
[01:56:40.339 --> 01:56:41.560]  That's what we're doing with our clients.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.160]  We're still buying lots of gold.
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:46.902]  Gold stocks are extremely cheap, and people really want to try to hit the home run here.
[01:56:46.902 --> 01:56:55.825]  You know, there's a lot of 10-baggers, 20-baggers in the gold mining space, even though a lot of these stocks are up 50%, 100%, 150% since mid-January.
[01:56:55.825 --> 01:56:56.805]  Since mid-January!
[01:56:56.805 --> 01:57:00.367]  You've got some stocks that have tripled, but there's still so much more to go.
[01:57:00.367 --> 01:57:06.769]  A lot of these stocks are still down 70%, 80% from where they were a few years ago, but I think the momentum is there in these stocks.
[01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:09.030]  Also in physical gold.
[01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:20.273]  And the markets I like the best, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, there's a lot of value there because the dollar is still overpriced because people haven't figured out what's around the corner yet.
[01:57:20.273 --> 01:57:33.478]  So there's still plenty of time for people to protect themselves and, you know, work with me at Europe's Civic Capital to get these diversified foreign portfolios or work with me at Shift Gold to get physical gold, you know, before it blows through $1,300.
[01:57:34.258 --> 01:57:40.224]  Because once it goes through there, you know, there's not that much resistance until we get back near the old highs of around 1900.
[01:57:40.224 --> 01:57:46.271]  Well, Peter, expanding on that, what I have Den on, he says, hey, all the gold in the world goes in an Olympic swimming pool.
[01:57:46.271 --> 01:57:48.013]  That's not what you're going to base the currency on.
[01:57:48.013 --> 01:57:50.555]  Well, that sounds like it's what you do base it on because it's scarce.
[01:57:50.555 --> 01:57:51.376]  Exactly.
[01:57:51.376 --> 01:57:52.538]  Plus it's industrial.
[01:57:54.099 --> 01:58:00.727]  Once the market's been so bad for four years or whatever, everybody's getting out of gold at the production level.
[01:58:00.727 --> 01:58:04.311]  That means then you can't ramp production back up for a long time.
[01:58:04.311 --> 01:58:10.078]  Once gold goes back up, to me, it seems like the biggest potential home run there is or grand slam.
[01:58:11.099 --> 01:58:11.659]  Absolutely.
[01:58:11.659 --> 01:58:14.500]  You better get your piece of that swimming pool while you can.
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:17.841]  Because the fact that it's scarce is one of the reasons it's so valuable.
[01:58:17.841 --> 01:58:24.304]  And yes, can we base the world's monetary system on gold at $1,230 an ounce?
[01:58:24.304 --> 01:58:25.304]  No, we can't.
[01:58:25.304 --> 01:58:27.005]  But at $10,000 an ounce?
[01:58:27.005 --> 01:58:28.445]  At $20,000 an ounce?
[01:58:28.445 --> 01:58:30.266]  Obviously, there's a price that's going to work.
[01:58:30.266 --> 01:58:30.546]  That's right.
[01:58:30.546 --> 01:58:31.426]  Stay there.
[01:58:31.426 --> 01:58:35.708]  And Davos talks about having a global SDR partially gold-backed.
[01:58:35.708 --> 01:58:37.909]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds with Peter Schiff.
[01:58:37.909 --> 01:58:38.209]  And then...
[01:58:39.056 --> 01:58:41.322]  We've got so much more coming up, folks.
[01:58:41.322 --> 01:58:43.407]  So much more on the campaign trail, South Carolina.
[01:58:48.376 --> 01:58:53.018]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:58:53.018 --> 01:58:57.780]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:58:59.121]  Talk about the effects.
[01:58:59.121 --> 01:59:00.622]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:59:00.622 --> 01:59:02.543]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:59:02.543 --> 01:59:03.663]  I feel like I look better.
[01:59:03.663 --> 01:59:04.363]  I feel better.
[01:59:04.363 --> 01:59:05.424]  I feel sexier.
[01:59:05.424 --> 01:59:06.404]  I love it.
[01:59:06.404 --> 01:59:09.386]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:59:09.386 --> 01:59:12.067]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[01:59:12.307 --> 01:59:13.367]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:59:13.367 --> 01:59:14.568]  Consult your physician.
[01:59:14.568 --> 01:59:16.928]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:59:16.928 --> 01:59:18.289]  This is life-changing.
[01:59:18.289 --> 01:59:19.209]  Shower filters.
[01:59:19.209 --> 01:59:20.930]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:59:20.930 --> 01:59:25.011]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[01:59:25.011 --> 01:59:29.812]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:59:29.812 --> 01:59:36.894]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[01:59:36.894 --> 01:59:39.735]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping
[01:59:39.815 --> 01:59:41.598]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:01.204 --> 02:00:07.826]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:00:07.826 --> 02:00:15.328]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.328 --> 02:00:18.888]  EuroPAC.com is his website.
[02:00:18.888 --> 02:00:25.010]  He's not a sponsor, but I do have him on because he knows what he's talking about when it comes to economics and things.
[02:00:25.010 --> 02:00:28.211]  And so that's why I do endorse a lot of Peter Schiff's ideas.
[02:00:29.298 --> 02:00:38.866]  But I'm just here to get people thinking for themselves and having a wide variety of different perspectives so you can make your own decisions.
[02:00:38.866 --> 02:00:48.675]  I just know that I've studied history and never before have humans been more unself-sufficient, more dependent, more spoiled rotten in the West.
[02:00:48.675 --> 02:00:54.680]  There are great people in Europe, great people in America, great people in Japan, great people in Australia, New Zealand, Canada.
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:56.162]  But let's just get down to brass tacks.
[02:00:57.682 --> 02:01:03.744]  I don't know how to take care of myself compared to my dad, and I'm like a caveman compared to the average yuppie.
[02:01:03.744 --> 02:01:09.046]  I mean, you hear about yuppies move out in the country, and they see their neighbor hauling a deer up to gut it, and they call the police on them.
[02:01:09.046 --> 02:01:11.647]  I see that article every, you know, day in the news.
[02:01:11.647 --> 02:01:14.348]  And the cops show up and act like it's wrong in many areas.
[02:01:14.348 --> 02:01:17.930]  You know, and it's just like, it's body snatchers or something.
[02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:20.451]  What are they going to do during this meltdown?
[02:01:20.451 --> 02:01:21.571]  And how bad is it going to get?
[02:01:21.571 --> 02:01:22.772]  We've only got about four minutes left.
[02:01:22.772 --> 02:01:23.312]  I wanted to just...
[02:01:24.724 --> 02:01:29.006]  Get any more time frame info from you, Peter, and then also ask, what do you think about the campaign so far?
[02:01:29.006 --> 02:01:30.787]  What do you think about Scalia?
[02:01:30.787 --> 02:01:31.867]  I didn't say they murdered him.
[02:01:31.867 --> 02:01:33.448]  I said there should be an autopsy.
[02:01:33.448 --> 02:01:35.349]  The cops have come out and said that too.
[02:01:35.349 --> 02:01:37.730]  One of the deputies came on and said they've never done this before.
[02:01:37.730 --> 02:01:40.010]  It's really weird.
[02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.791]  Other little tidbits about what's happening.
[02:01:41.791 --> 02:01:42.972]  Bernie Sanders, what a nightmare.
[02:01:43.692 --> 02:01:49.735]  Well, obviously, look, there should be an autopsy, but, you know, 79-year-old guy, overweight, probably not in the best shape.
[02:01:49.735 --> 02:01:55.939]  I mean, the fact that he died of natural causes is, you know, obviously not something that's outside the realm of possibility.
[02:01:55.939 --> 02:02:00.961]  But, look, they should still do an autopsy anyway, just to clear away any potential doubts.
[02:02:00.961 --> 02:02:03.783]  But, you know, Bernie Sanders, that is very scary.
[02:02:03.783 --> 02:02:08.966]  I mean, if you look at the support that he enjoys, particularly with younger people in this country,
[02:02:09.346 --> 02:02:19.876]  And that is a very scary thought, because unfortunately this is a democracy which means mobocracy, which means majority rules, and if the majority are a bunch of socialists, we're in trouble.
[02:02:19.876 --> 02:02:25.982]  Look, the Nazi party, again, not that I'm going to compare... But they were national socialists, and Hitler was going to give them something for free.
[02:02:25.982 --> 02:02:31.347]  What about Sanders, it turns out, never had a paying job till 40, and bragged that he was a bum.
[02:02:31.347 --> 02:02:32.188]  The guy is a bum!
[02:02:32.728 --> 02:02:36.250]  Yeah, but my point is, but we elected, Germany elected the Nazis.
[02:02:36.250 --> 02:02:40.171]  But the point is, this is the danger of putting things up to a vote.
[02:02:40.171 --> 02:02:50.096]  When you have American school system, we indoctrinate kids, they learn absolutely nothing, they're brainwashed until they're 22 years old, and they come out Bernie Sanders voters.
[02:02:50.096 --> 02:02:57.039]  They know nothing about economics, they know nothing about the history of this country, they know nothing about our founding principles or what made this country great.
[02:02:57.039 --> 02:02:57.539]  They're idiots.
[02:02:57.739 --> 02:02:58.259]  He said the U.S.
[02:02:58.259 --> 02:02:59.520]  has never been better financially.
[02:03:18.747 --> 02:03:23.008]  No, and people are frustrated because at least Bill Clinton said, I feel your pain.
[02:03:23.008 --> 02:03:25.208]  Barack Obama's like, hey, there's no pain to feel.
[02:03:25.208 --> 02:03:26.429]  I've done a great job.
[02:03:26.429 --> 02:03:34.330]  And this is just, you know, creating a great environment for Bernie Sanders to tap into that resentment, that frustration, and of course the envy.
[02:03:34.330 --> 02:03:36.011]  Who do you think wins in a matchup?
[02:03:36.011 --> 02:03:39.371]  I mean, because now even Salon's throwing in the towel saying Hillary can't win.
[02:03:39.371 --> 02:03:43.192]  Who's more dangerous, Bernie or Hillary A, and then B?
[02:03:43.192 --> 02:03:46.353]  I think Trump will dominate either one of those clowns in the general election.
[02:03:46.673 --> 02:03:51.997]  You know, Trump is an unknown quantity because, you know, Trump is a showman, right?
[02:03:51.997 --> 02:03:57.260]  And he may be saying certain things because he knows that that's what's going to get the votes.
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:04:04.385]  I mean, Trump, I probably, Trump has better judgment and is, you know, and probably more intelligent to actually do the right thing.
[02:04:04.725 --> 02:04:10.128]  A lot of the things that he's saying to get elected, hopefully those aren't going to be the things that he does if he is elected.
[02:04:10.128 --> 02:04:16.712]  He might just be, you know, as much as he says, I'm not a politician, he's playing politics, because he knows what works.
[02:04:16.712 --> 02:04:25.418]  And by holding himself up out not to be a politician, right, to say I'm not the same old thing, I'm something different, there's a lot of politics there, because he's not doing anything.
[02:04:25.418 --> 02:04:28.780]  Sure, I'm not usually lesser to evils, but we know he's better than Hillary and Bernie.
[02:04:29.554 --> 02:04:31.195]  Well, no question about it.
[02:04:31.195 --> 02:04:32.516]  But the question is, what will he do?
[02:04:32.516 --> 02:04:41.523]  I mean, if he obviously tries to put all these tariffs on, and he doesn't really want to cut Social Security, he wants to replace Obamacare with some other kind of government socialized program.
[02:04:41.523 --> 02:04:44.325]  If he wants to do a lot of this stuff, then it's going to be a disaster.
[02:04:44.325 --> 02:04:47.167]  But hopefully he's smart enough not to actually do that.
[02:04:47.167 --> 02:04:49.449]  Once he gets elected, he can do what's right.
[02:04:49.449 --> 02:04:51.330]  All right, Peter Schiff, we're out of time.
[02:04:51.330 --> 02:04:52.651]  Thank you so much, Peter.
[02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:53.452]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:54.352]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:54.352 --> 02:04:55.093]  Stay with us.
[02:04:55.093 --> 02:04:56.674]  We're going to be talking to Dr. Group.
[02:04:58.490 --> 02:05:01.992]  When you talk about leveling with the American people, have you always told the truth?
[02:05:01.992 --> 02:05:02.793]  I've always tried to.
[02:05:02.793 --> 02:05:06.415]  I'm George Washington and I try not to tell lies.
[02:05:06.415 --> 02:05:08.456]  Leanne McAdoo with InfoWars.com.
[02:05:08.456 --> 02:05:10.177]  Let me level with you, America.
[02:05:10.177 --> 02:05:12.919]  Here's just a small sampling of Hillary's whoppers.
[02:05:12.919 --> 02:05:20.824]  There's the Benghazi hearing, using a secret private server to hide her activities, lying about not sharing classified information on that secret server.
[02:05:21.104 --> 02:05:26.027]  Using the Clinton Foundation as a cover for tax evasion and taking bribes from foreign countries.
[02:05:26.027 --> 02:05:33.451]  She claims to be against the big banks, but won't release transcripts of the speeches she made to those banks who paid her hefty speaking fees.
[02:05:33.451 --> 02:05:42.216]  Whitewater, Watergate, defending a rapist, threatening all of Bill's bimbos in an effort to keep them quiet, then claiming to run a campaign for women.
[02:05:42.216 --> 02:05:48.320]  Clinton even took $190,000 worth of household goods from the White House when Bill left office.
[02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:50.887]  I guess they were dead broke at the time.
[02:05:50.887 --> 02:05:53.495]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:05:53.495 --> 02:05:55.100]  Read more at InfoWars.com
[02:05:59.645 --> 02:06:03.408]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:06:03.408 --> 02:06:11.153]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:06:11.153 --> 02:06:19.778]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:06:19.778 --> 02:06:24.201]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:06:24.201 --> 02:06:29.565]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:06:29.765 --> 02:06:34.006]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:06:34.006 --> 02:06:37.427]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:06:37.427 --> 02:06:48.550]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:51.450]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:57.432]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[02:06:58.092 --> 02:07:03.836]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[02:07:03.836 --> 02:07:18.287]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fused it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[02:07:18.547 --> 02:07:26.551]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.

[02:07:32.113 --> 02:07:35.675]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[02:07:35.675 --> 02:07:39.817]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[02:07:39.817 --> 02:07:43.679]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[02:07:44.119 --> 02:07:48.242]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[02:07:59.409 --> 02:08:01.349]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:08:01.349 --> 02:08:03.310]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:06.230]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:08:06.230 --> 02:08:07.071]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:07.071 --> 02:08:08.151]  His name is Alex Jones.
[02:08:08.151 --> 02:08:11.252]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:08:11.252 --> 02:08:14.532]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:08:14.532 --> 02:08:16.493]  Alex Jones, the nut job radio guy.
[02:08:16.493 --> 02:08:18.093]  Talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:08:18.093 --> 02:08:23.534]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says.
[02:08:23.534 --> 02:08:24.554]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:08:24.554 --> 02:08:26.115]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:08:26.115 --> 02:08:26.955]  This isn't a game!
[02:08:27.996 --> 02:08:30.019]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[02:08:30.019 --> 02:08:34.407]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
[02:08:34.407 --> 02:08:36.370]  1776 will commence again if you try to...
[02:08:38.499 --> 02:08:40.480]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:42.221]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[02:08:42.221 --> 02:08:45.523]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[02:08:45.523 --> 02:08:48.185]  It's an internet talk show called InfoWars.
[02:08:48.185 --> 02:08:50.706]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[02:08:50.706 --> 02:08:51.387]  Dave!
[02:08:51.387 --> 02:08:53.628]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[02:08:53.628 --> 02:08:56.429]  You're making some very serious allegations against the U.S.
[02:08:56.429 --> 02:09:01.312]  government, saying that they stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against U.S.
[02:09:01.312 --> 02:09:02.233]  citizens.
[02:09:02.233 --> 02:09:03.994]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[02:09:03.994 --> 02:09:06.475]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:09:06.475 --> 02:09:07.596]  That man's a threat to this country.
[02:09:07.896 --> 02:09:09.277]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:09:09.277 --> 02:09:10.658]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[02:09:10.658 --> 02:09:12.499]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:09:12.499 --> 02:09:14.381]  He's considered legitimate among the crazy.
[02:09:14.381 --> 02:09:20.565]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[02:09:20.565 --> 02:09:22.006]  I'd love to see that.
[02:09:22.006 --> 02:09:24.047]  In uniform.
[02:09:24.047 --> 02:09:27.429]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[02:09:27.429 --> 02:09:29.711]  I like that, guys.
[02:09:29.711 --> 02:09:35.455]  That is the best!
[02:09:35.455 --> 02:09:36.616]  It's Friday Live.
[02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:39.631]  We've reached the midway point.
[02:09:39.631 --> 02:09:45.594]  Two hours lay before us.
[02:09:45.594 --> 02:09:48.095]  We have gangsters running this country.
[02:09:48.095 --> 02:09:48.795]  Criminals!
[02:09:48.795 --> 02:09:49.355]  Gangsters!
[02:09:49.355 --> 02:09:52.237]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[02:09:54.710 --> 02:09:58.252]  We have a fog that has descended upon our entire nation.
[02:09:58.252 --> 02:10:00.513]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[02:10:00.513 --> 02:10:02.594]  Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[02:10:02.594 --> 02:10:08.397]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[02:10:08.397 --> 02:10:09.557]  It's as real as it gets.
[02:10:09.557 --> 02:10:13.239]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:10:13.239 --> 02:10:14.540]  To Matt, it's over for you.
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:17.001]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:10:17.001 --> 02:10:18.241]  You're out of there.
[02:10:18.241 --> 02:10:19.822]  You want it, baby?
[02:10:19.822 --> 02:10:21.403]  You're about to get it.
[02:10:28.078 --> 02:10:36.500]  We did meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant, and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:41.421]  We met them at Concord Bridge, and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[02:10:41.421 --> 02:10:53.424]  InfoWars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of that.
[02:10:53.604 --> 02:10:56.925]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women.
[02:10:56.925 --> 02:11:01.908]  No, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[02:11:01.908 --> 02:11:12.012]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[02:11:12.012 --> 02:11:14.853]  These people are of the devil.
[02:11:14.853 --> 02:11:16.154]  Let's be very blunt about this.
[02:11:16.594 --> 02:11:20.097]  Raise, tell, and demand accountability.
[02:11:20.097 --> 02:11:27.764]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[02:11:27.764 --> 02:11:33.669]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:11:33.669 --> 02:11:35.770]  The crowd is now moving forward toward the barrier.
[02:11:35.770 --> 02:11:40.654]  The police have been telling everybody they're going to shoot if we don't move back.
[02:11:40.654 --> 02:11:44.518]  Their defeat will be ultimately a crushing one.
[02:11:46.257 --> 02:11:51.641]  From the front lines of the information war, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:11:51.641 --> 02:11:54.643]  See, I could sit up here and do the whole show in a perfect radio voice, but I don't.
[02:11:54.643 --> 02:11:56.644]  I get up here and it's obnoxious sometimes.
[02:11:56.644 --> 02:12:05.631]  I listened to about two hours of the broadcast yesterday, last night on the free iPhone app while I was doing research late into the evening, and a lot of it was good info.
[02:12:05.631 --> 02:12:07.132]  The guests were great.
[02:12:07.132 --> 02:12:07.712]  The facts were
[02:12:08.968 --> 02:12:19.633]  Very illuminating, but I can hear myself getting overwrought, getting wound up, trying to cover too much, getting sped up in the third hour.
[02:12:19.633 --> 02:12:26.415]  And so today I'm going to try to just sit back and relax and just cover everything.
[02:12:26.415 --> 02:12:32.038]  Now, I have moved Biggs, Daniels, Madsen, Knight, and everybody to the
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:37.863]  Fourth hour, so they can just host it today, instead of just coming in here and being guests for 30 minutes.
[02:12:37.863 --> 02:12:50.434]  They're just going to host a roundtable about Scalia, about political assassinations, about... We've got a Michael Savage interview with... that Begg's got, that he's going to air some of, so Michael Savage in the next hour.
[02:12:50.434 --> 02:12:53.556]  Just a bunch of other stuff in the fourth hour.
[02:12:53.556 --> 02:13:00.802]  So that way, I can relax right now, take my time, cover some of the news that I haven't gotten to yet, talk to Dr. Gribb for about 20 minutes,
[02:13:02.071 --> 02:13:08.933]  On some big breaking news and then segue into all these clips and other news I haven't covered that have me hyperventilating.
[02:13:08.933 --> 02:13:10.434]  The TPP text is out.
[02:13:10.434 --> 02:13:12.494]  It does end copyright as we know it.
[02:13:12.494 --> 02:13:16.956]  If you say Mickey Mouse, they will shut down your website.
[02:13:16.956 --> 02:13:25.218]  They're actually going to say internationally in a secret treaty we've signed that they can copyright words and then you can't use them even in your own text.
[02:13:25.218 --> 02:13:27.559]  Hyperlinks will be illegal.
[02:13:29.141 --> 02:13:36.487]  But they just come in through the multinational internet system and that's why they've transferred ICANN and all that to the UN now.
[02:13:36.487 --> 02:13:41.091]  This is all being done for massive censorship and they're modeling it after China.
[02:13:41.091 --> 02:13:44.554]  China set to ban all foreign media from publishing online.
[02:13:44.554 --> 02:13:45.535]  Devastating info.
[02:13:45.535 --> 02:13:51.099]  And again, Matt Drudge was here four or five months ago, whatever it was, in this studio.
[02:13:51.099 --> 02:13:54.202]  He's done like one other interview in four or five years.
[02:13:54.202 --> 02:13:57.524]  I mean, the media just couldn't believe it.
[02:13:57.524 --> 02:13:57.604]  And
[02:13:59.915 --> 02:14:12.908]  He came here because he knew that even though he's a serious person, broken thousands of international stories, broken some of the biggest stories ever, that they'd make a joke out of it if he came and said, I had dinner with a Supreme Court Justice and they warned everybody's coming after the free press next year.
[02:14:12.908 --> 02:14:14.109]  This is now next year.
[02:14:14.109 --> 02:14:16.311]  Even though he's known to be friends with these people.
[02:14:16.311 --> 02:14:20.375]  He just knew he could actually come here and actually talk for 45 minutes and then we wouldn't censor him.
[02:14:23.749 --> 02:14:33.577]  And of course he could do it on his own platform as well, but he was showing solidarity to support this broadcast because he understands they're coming after all of us.
[02:14:33.577 --> 02:14:38.120]  When they're always trying to put Limbaugh in jail because his back was hurt and he was on some pain pills.
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:39.081]  Whoop-dee-doo!
[02:14:39.081 --> 02:14:42.204]  The government ships the narcotics in.
[02:14:42.204 --> 02:14:44.706]  Or they try to constantly find stuff to put me in jail for.
[02:14:44.706 --> 02:14:49.469]  A lot of folks go, well you better shut up then and go along with this.
[02:14:49.469 --> 02:14:49.509]  No!
[02:14:51.584 --> 02:14:54.106]  And it's not that Limbaugh is even perfect.
[02:14:54.106 --> 02:14:54.747]  Nobody is.
[02:14:54.747 --> 02:14:55.567]  It's the point.
[02:14:55.567 --> 02:14:59.931]  If they can take him down, they can take everybody down.
[02:14:59.931 --> 02:15:01.973]  And Mark Levins has a lot of stuff I agree with.
[02:15:01.973 --> 02:15:04.415]  He's a talented talk show host.
[02:15:04.415 --> 02:15:12.821]  But to call Donald Trump a wacko nut because he said there's 28 pages that show Saudi Arabia carried out the attacks and the Bushes are known heroes.
[02:15:12.821 --> 02:15:15.644]  It says in there, and I've interviewed Walter Jones of North Carolina,
[02:15:16.724 --> 02:15:30.150]  I've interviewed Rand Paul of Kentucky who's seen it, and I've interviewed a former senator who saw it was on the commission, and six of the ten say there's a cover-up, including Republicans.
[02:15:30.150 --> 02:15:32.431]  The 28 pages say a stand-down was ordered.
[02:15:32.431 --> 02:15:33.272]  That's high treason.
[02:15:35.262 --> 02:15:36.983]  It was an inside job.
[02:15:36.983 --> 02:15:38.183]  Not saying there isn't radical Islam.
[02:15:38.183 --> 02:15:38.744]  No, no.
[02:15:38.744 --> 02:15:42.705]  Just like they bring in the radical Islamists, then they attack us, then they take our freedom.
[02:15:42.705 --> 02:15:44.166]  Europe is under civil emergency.
[02:15:44.166 --> 02:15:45.667]  Martial law in France and Germany.
[02:15:45.667 --> 02:15:47.347]  They're arresting people.
[02:15:47.347 --> 02:15:52.049]  Prominent people that mildly criticize open borders.
[02:15:52.049 --> 02:15:54.530]  There is a false flag to the radical Islam.
[02:15:54.530 --> 02:16:01.634]  They're bringing it in.
[02:16:01.634 --> 02:16:01.854]  Sick.
[02:16:03.103 --> 02:16:07.004]  And that's why I'm backing Trump, because my gut tells me to go with him.
[02:16:07.004 --> 02:16:07.964]  My gut tells me.
[02:16:07.964 --> 02:16:09.245]  This is not a setup.
[02:16:09.245 --> 02:16:18.987]  When he starts doing stuff like that, or starts telling the pub, hey, you got 200 foot walls, and quoting me exactly, again, you know Trump is aware and involved.
[02:16:18.987 --> 02:16:21.888]  And Trump does read our material and does listen to the show.
[02:16:21.888 --> 02:16:23.089]  And I don't sit there and brag about that.
[02:16:23.089 --> 02:16:23.609]  It's just a fact.
[02:16:23.609 --> 02:16:24.549]  And he's obviously been on the show.
[02:16:25.249 --> 02:16:26.610]  And he knew what happened when he did that.
[02:16:26.610 --> 02:16:28.392]  Now, Dr. Gribble will be with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:16:28.392 --> 02:16:30.773]  I'm going to him right after the break.
[02:16:30.773 --> 02:16:33.635]  He just has such incredible research.
[02:16:33.635 --> 02:16:37.978]  He's constantly contacting us and pointing out, hey, have you covered this?
[02:16:37.978 --> 02:16:40.520]  FDA to start testing for glyphosate in the food.
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:41.901]  Why this is so big?
[02:16:41.901 --> 02:16:48.786]  We'll talk about how many tons of this has been dumped on the soil and it's in every known water supply in the U.S.
[02:16:48.786 --> 02:16:51.008]  And it is miracle growth for cancer in mammals.
[02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:53.070]  FDA to start testing.
[02:16:53.070 --> 02:16:53.851]  We're going to look at that.
[02:16:53.851 --> 02:16:57.492]  We're going to look at toxins found in seafood worldwide.
[02:16:57.492 --> 02:17:00.674]  Dangerous toxins in cabin air passed on to cruise study finds.
[02:17:00.674 --> 02:17:01.634]  And why are we covering this?
[02:17:01.634 --> 02:17:04.315]  There's ways to mitigate, block, and detoxify.
[02:17:04.315 --> 02:17:06.757]  Are antibacterial soaps safe?
[02:17:06.757 --> 02:17:09.898]  Even the Wall Street Journal says what Group reported on 20 years ago.
[02:17:09.898 --> 02:17:10.778]  It sterilizes you.
[02:17:10.778 --> 02:17:14.080]  It's part of the sperm not having tails or shrunken tails.
[02:17:17.179 --> 02:17:21.860]  Prevalence of fetal exposure to environmental toxins is determined by analysis.
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:23.801]  We're going to get to all of this.
[02:17:23.801 --> 02:17:29.322]  Body burden, the pollution in newborns, how it's passed on, the toxicity in your body.
[02:17:29.322 --> 02:17:32.363]  I mean, this is hardcore stuff, but there's things you can do.
[02:17:32.363 --> 02:17:36.163]  A lot of people say, I'm just going to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and eat GMO.
[02:17:36.163 --> 02:17:37.604]  I don't care if I die.
[02:17:37.604 --> 02:17:40.264]  What about how you pass that on?
[02:17:40.264 --> 02:17:42.625]  What about what happens with your wife as a kid?
[02:17:42.625 --> 02:17:44.045]  We're dying as a species.
[02:17:44.045 --> 02:17:45.006]  The earth is dying.
[02:17:45.006 --> 02:17:46.426]  There are real environmental crises.
[02:17:48.130 --> 02:17:53.671]  And the environment, and the environmental movement is globalist, eugenicist, transhumanist run.
[02:17:53.671 --> 02:17:55.612]  They want to destroy the earth and rewrite it.
[02:17:55.612 --> 02:17:56.552]  They say the earth's done.
[02:17:56.552 --> 02:17:57.452]  They're going to build a new one.
[02:17:57.452 --> 02:17:58.912]  They want to live forever.
[02:17:58.912 --> 02:18:00.873]  They're on power trips.
[02:18:00.873 --> 02:18:04.614]  And so they control the movement by making it about carbon that's life-giving.
[02:18:04.614 --> 02:18:08.114]  It's so ingenious and sick.
[02:18:08.114 --> 02:18:10.175]  We are the environmentalists.
[02:18:10.175 --> 02:18:11.415]  We are the true
[02:18:13.925 --> 02:18:16.446]  Folks that are promoting sustainability.
[02:18:16.446 --> 02:18:19.787]  The Globals are all about not having sustainability.
[02:18:19.787 --> 02:18:23.988]  They got a lot of window dressing that sounds good, but at the heart of it is evil.
[02:18:23.988 --> 02:18:26.709]  And yes, there'll be a plug here as well.
[02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:27.630]  That's not why he's here.
[02:18:27.630 --> 02:18:30.871]  I wanted to get him on about this, but he formulated this exclusive just for us.
[02:18:32.287 --> 02:18:33.567]  And it's liver shield.
[02:18:33.567 --> 02:18:37.089]  And we also have the bio shield that he also formulated exclusively for us.
[02:18:37.089 --> 02:18:41.290]  But liver shield, you take it for six days in your water with apple cider vinegar that we don't sell.
[02:18:41.290 --> 02:18:45.511]  Get it at any major store, any grocery store, in the water.
[02:18:45.511 --> 02:18:46.632]  You take it for six days.
[02:18:46.632 --> 02:18:52.133]  You take the oxy powder, four to seven tablets, depending on how big you are, for six days.
[02:18:52.133 --> 02:18:56.635]  And then you take the seven ounces of organic
[02:18:57.535 --> 02:19:16.129]  Virgin olive oil and you lay on the side that's got your liver and gallbladder and most people the next morning it is fireworks with me it took a day and a half and I was I was I was blown away it was like the movie Alien and Leanne's done it done a video on it and dude lost 12 or 13 pounds he's not fat it was stuff in him
[02:19:17.403 --> 02:19:20.004]  They say John Wayne had like 40-something pounds of beef and stuff.
[02:19:20.004 --> 02:19:27.388]  I don't want to get gross here, but this isn't like some of the rough herbs and things that are painful.
[02:19:27.388 --> 02:19:30.490]  This is oxygen with the herbs, and it's spectacular.
[02:19:30.490 --> 02:19:31.310]  And I'm a lazy butt.
[02:19:31.310 --> 02:19:32.891]  I'm not a big vitamin and mineral person.
[02:19:32.891 --> 02:19:34.852]  When I finally started doing it, it changed my life.
[02:19:34.852 --> 02:19:36.032]  I've only done the cleanse twice.
[02:19:36.032 --> 02:19:36.893]  I need to just do it.
[02:19:38.610 --> 02:19:42.153]  Big thing is you don't drink for a week, and I like a beer or so at night or a glass of wine.
[02:19:42.153 --> 02:19:45.335]  I mean, I'm not gonna be a hypocrite here, you know, tell folks I'm some teetotaler.
[02:19:45.335 --> 02:19:48.317]  What do they call the South Baptist bottle-opers?
[02:19:48.317 --> 02:19:50.759]  They call them church keys.
[02:19:50.759 --> 02:19:54.902]  The point is I'm gonna do one of these again very soon, but everybody can see how much better I look.
[02:19:54.902 --> 02:19:55.503]  It's back in.
[02:19:55.503 --> 02:19:56.263]  It was sold out.
[02:19:56.263 --> 02:19:58.705]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:19:58.705 --> 02:20:02.148]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:20:02.947 --> 02:20:03.567]  It's true.
[02:20:03.567 --> 02:20:07.730]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:10.111]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:20:10.111 --> 02:20:14.894]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[02:21:59.557 --> 02:22:01.158]  Hi, my name is Nick Lupo.
[02:22:01.158 --> 02:22:04.419]  One World Way has been by far the best protein that I've ever had.
[02:22:04.419 --> 02:22:06.020]  I take it three times a day.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:11.523]  Once in the morning as soon as I wake, once for a pre-workout snack, and once for a post-workout recovery drink.
[02:22:11.523 --> 02:22:15.045]  It has helped me transform and sculpt my body into what I have now.
[02:22:15.045 --> 02:22:20.187]  I began taking the product about two years ago, and boy, let me tell you, I'm in the best shape of my life.
[02:22:20.187 --> 02:22:23.629]  I've seen major muscle mass gains and have zero percent body fat.
[02:22:23.849 --> 02:22:28.311]  I have had people in my gym ask if I compete in bodybuilding because of how lean and muscular I am.
[02:22:28.311 --> 02:22:34.734]  I used to suffer from everyday aches and pains from hard manual labor my whole life and arthritis that runs through my family.
[02:22:34.734 --> 02:22:38.995]  But One World Weight has helped me take that everyday pain from a 10 to a 3.
[02:22:38.995 --> 02:22:41.857]  Some days I feel no pain at all, just full of life and energy.
[02:22:41.857 --> 02:22:44.938]  It has also helped my skin look younger and healthier.
[02:22:44.938 --> 02:22:47.519]  Thank you, Synergistic Nutrition, for One World Weight.

[02:24:02.252 --> 02:24:03.773]  Speaking of the vampire...
[02:24:24.019 --> 02:24:34.104]  Because maybe it's that Senator Sanders wasn't really a Democrat until he decided to run for President and he doesn't even know what the, you know, last two Democratic Presidents did.
[02:24:34.104 --> 02:24:37.406]  And I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, well, it's true!
[02:24:37.406 --> 02:24:38.167]  It's true!
[02:24:38.167 --> 02:24:39.067]  You know it's true!
[02:24:39.067 --> 02:24:40.188]  It's true!
[02:24:40.188 --> 02:24:40.648]  It's true!
[02:24:41.008 --> 02:24:47.410]  I mean, it happens to be true, and I gotta tell you, I look at our last two Democratic presidents, were they perfect?
[02:24:47.410 --> 02:24:48.090]  No.
[02:24:48.090 --> 02:24:56.633]  No person is, but I'll tell you what, I would take the two of them over any Republican, anytime, anywhere.
[02:24:56.633 --> 02:25:04.316]  Oh, those people are just so into how they're liberal, and they're into freedom, and they're social justice warriors, and this is the CIA black-op.
[02:25:05.558 --> 02:25:14.745]  Opmina, Arkansas, all the murders, Benghazi, the corruption, the stolen valor, the Brian Williams of female politicians, but it's all about women.
[02:25:14.745 --> 02:25:17.307]  Well, guess what?
[02:25:17.307 --> 02:25:28.495]  Salon, the folks that endorse pedophilia in five articles in the last few years, literally, you know, that say it's just a, you know, a right, I guess, or something, cute, they are saying it's over for Hillary.
[02:25:28.495 --> 02:25:30.196]  The LA Times is saying it.
[02:25:30.196 --> 02:25:33.898]  I want to get into the news, the health news with you, Dr. Group, but as an American, as an Army veteran,
[02:25:34.719 --> 02:25:38.262]  As a patriot, what do you think of this election?
[02:25:38.262 --> 02:25:39.403]  What do you think of what's happening?
[02:25:39.403 --> 02:25:45.248]  What do you think of, wow, Hillary, a referendum on the establishment, sinking in her own party.
[02:25:45.248 --> 02:25:46.809]  That is amazing.
[02:25:46.809 --> 02:25:47.650]  And what do you think of Trump?
[02:25:48.991 --> 02:25:57.314]  I've been watching your show a lot and listening to a lot of other people out there, and I think we're right in the middle of a revolution.
[02:25:57.314 --> 02:26:14.041]  There's a lot of things good that are happening, there's a lot of things bad that are happening, but ultimately it's people like us and the Infowarriors out there that are fighting for things every single day to eliminate the toxins in the air, the food, and the water, and I think we're on the verge of a change.
[02:26:14.041 --> 02:26:15.562]  I personally like Trump myself.
[02:26:17.130 --> 02:26:22.676]  It's just, I can't even believe some of the words that comes out of the Democrats' mouths.
[02:26:22.676 --> 02:26:24.999]  I mean, we have an economy that's crashing.
[02:26:24.999 --> 02:26:27.181]  We have a healthcare system that is horrible.
[02:26:27.181 --> 02:26:29.383]  Doctors are quitting their jobs.
[02:26:29.383 --> 02:26:32.166]  We have a whole world that is sick.
[02:26:33.227 --> 02:26:35.789]  The whole water supply in the world is contaminated.
[02:26:35.789 --> 02:26:37.509]  The air supply is contaminated.
[02:26:37.509 --> 02:26:40.051]  So, I mean, it can't get that much worse.
[02:26:40.051 --> 02:26:45.954]  I mean, on the good side of things, we do have solutions for a lot of those problems.
[02:26:45.954 --> 02:26:49.576]  I was about to say, two years ago, the FDA comes out and says fluoride does give you cancer.
[02:26:49.576 --> 02:26:50.596]  We should take it out of the water.
[02:26:50.596 --> 02:26:52.958]  Still hasn't happened, but they're starting to do it.
[02:26:52.958 --> 02:26:54.718]  We told people glyphosate was growing tumors.
[02:26:54.718 --> 02:26:55.319]  It was well known.
[02:26:55.319 --> 02:26:57.600]  Now they're talking about removing it and banning it.
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:26:59.501]  There's so many good things happening.
[02:26:59.501 --> 02:27:01.122]  I think we may be hitting bottom.
[02:27:02.534 --> 02:27:09.499]  Yeah, I was telling my employees the other day when we had a company meeting, I said, you guys don't really understand what you're part of here.
[02:27:09.499 --> 02:27:12.681]  I mean, we are part of a revolution.
[02:27:12.681 --> 02:27:29.832]  In 15 years, 20 years, when they write the history books, and they look back and they say, these were the problems years ago, up until 2014, 2015, 2016, the water was poisonous, the food was poisonous, and our kids say, how did that happen, Dad?
[02:27:29.832 --> 02:27:30.873]  How did all that happen?
[02:27:30.913 --> 02:27:32.834]  Just like, how do we inject black people with syphilis?
[02:27:32.834 --> 02:27:34.914]  Or how do we radiate foster children?
[02:27:34.914 --> 02:27:37.635]  They're going to look back and say, how did that happen?
[02:27:37.635 --> 02:27:39.056]  Yeah, but we're all heroes!
[02:27:39.056 --> 02:27:52.560]  I mean, we haven't realized it yet, but you're a hero, we're a hero, the Infowars, all the people that are coming forward that are forcing the EPA, the FDA to change... The majority of those government scientists are our biggest allies, saying we're absolutely right!
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:55.741]  We have the military totally awake, exposing the Al-Qaeda connection.
[02:27:56.829 --> 02:28:14.601]  Right, so even though we're going through an attack right now, in the future we'll be looked upon as the revolutionaries that actually changed the world and brought in a new peaceful government, a non-corrupt government, and healthy living technologies.
[02:28:14.601 --> 02:28:18.984]  I mean, you can almost see oil and gas falling down and free energy coming in.
[02:28:18.984 --> 02:28:20.465]  I mean, this should have happened years ago.
[02:28:20.465 --> 02:28:22.347]  You can see the pharmaceutical industry
[02:28:23.267 --> 02:28:26.469]  That is threatened right now by the natural health industry.
[02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:31.733]  So you can see these big industries that are running scared right now and that are fearful.
[02:28:31.733 --> 02:28:34.575]  And it all has to do with public activism.
[02:28:34.575 --> 02:28:37.436]  We said three years ago McDonald's will go bankrupt by 2020.
[02:28:37.436 --> 02:28:38.837]  It looks like it may be earlier than that.
[02:28:38.837 --> 02:28:40.759]  They now admit they're facing collapse.
[02:28:41.979 --> 02:28:43.240]  I mean, it is just a beautiful thing.
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:45.221]  And again, we don't want to see, quote, an American company collapse.
[02:28:45.221 --> 02:28:45.522]  It's not.
[02:28:45.522 --> 02:28:56.028]  It's a globalist, Monsanto, Bill Gates front of frankenfood to test us and lower our standards and break our will and demoralize us as an enemy operation, literally.
[02:28:56.028 --> 02:29:03.773]  And the fact that it's in trouble, Coca-Cola's in trouble, all these globalist operations, the two big parties, their establishment's in trouble.
[02:29:03.773 --> 02:29:08.296]  And I want to clarify, when I say we've hit bottom, I mean culturally, things are going to get a lot worse now.
[02:29:09.036 --> 02:29:10.437]  Culturally, we've hit rock bottom.
[02:29:10.437 --> 02:29:12.178]  We're bounding back up right now.
[02:29:12.178 --> 02:29:17.260]  But we're going to go through the physical problems and tribulations now.
[02:29:17.260 --> 02:29:18.181]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:29:18.181 --> 02:29:23.244]  And one of the things that is important is that everybody continues to do what they're doing.
[02:29:23.244 --> 02:29:25.625]  You know, writing letters to their senators, legislators.
[02:29:25.625 --> 02:29:31.888]  I think this new group of children that are being raised, that are coming up right now, are more aware.
[02:29:33.909 --> 02:29:38.532]  Our generation, well, more and more people are becoming aware every single day all over the world.
[02:29:38.532 --> 02:29:39.392]  Stay there, I want to come back.
[02:29:39.392 --> 02:29:40.012]  I totally agree.
[02:29:40.012 --> 02:29:46.876]  People are either being born and put in front of TVs and being totally destroyed, but there's the biggest crop ever of super people, basically.
[02:29:46.876 --> 02:29:51.779]  I mean, just folks that are going to respond genetically and spiritually to the attack.
[02:29:51.779 --> 02:29:54.320]  Get ready for the real rise of the resistance.
[02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:55.701]  We're only the first phase, folks.
[02:29:58.672 --> 02:30:04.374]  A tech exec is outraged at having to see homeless riffraff and he warns of a revolution.
[02:30:04.374 --> 02:30:11.357]  In an open letter to San Francisco's mayor, tech entrepreneur Justin Keller asks, what are you going to do to address this problem?
[02:30:11.357 --> 02:30:20.661]  He describes some of his unfortunate encounters with the homeless riffraff on the streets who disturb his ability to enjoy the trendy upscale San Francisco neighborhoods.
[02:30:20.661 --> 02:30:27.864]  He bemoans the fact that wealthy workers have to witness the pain, struggle, and despair of the homeless people on their daily commute.
[02:30:28.944 --> 02:30:31.745]  He then warns there's going to be a revolution.
[02:30:31.745 --> 02:30:39.049]  Indeed, darlings like Keller, enriched by the latest speculative tech bubble, are completely oblivious to the coming financial tsunami.
[02:30:39.049 --> 02:30:46.512]  Bubble economics is responsible for the success Keller enjoys, but as the economy falters, that source of financing will inevitably dry up.
[02:30:46.512 --> 02:30:56.156]  The speculative.com bubble crash of the late 1990s is set for a repeat, and the Justin Kellers of the world have no idea just how close to homeless they really are.

[02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:58.711]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:31:58.711 --> 02:31:59.792]  Good, brother.
[02:31:59.792 --> 02:32:01.753]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:32:01.753 --> 02:32:03.474]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:32:03.474 --> 02:32:07.496]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:32:07.496 --> 02:32:10.117]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:32:10.117 --> 02:32:12.539]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:32:12.539 --> 02:32:20.403]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:32:20.703 --> 02:32:23.946]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:32:23.946 --> 02:32:25.488]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:32:25.488 --> 02:32:28.411]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:32:28.411 --> 02:32:30.172]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:32:30.172 --> 02:32:32.915]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:32:32.915 --> 02:32:35.978]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[02:32:36.238 --> 02:32:38.019]  Or maximum potency.
[02:32:38.019 --> 02:32:44.483]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[02:32:44.483 --> 02:32:48.225]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[02:32:48.225 --> 02:32:50.026]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:32:50.026 --> 02:32:56.950]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[02:33:07.248 --> 02:33:12.111]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:12.111 --> 02:33:16.693]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.693 --> 02:33:24.877]  By the way, the social engineers are in high overdrive right now to the point I can't even believe it when I see this stuff.
[02:33:24.877 --> 02:33:27.379]  So before we get into health news, I want to ask Dr. Grim about this.
[02:33:29.187 --> 02:33:39.869]  He's not just, you know, an incredible supplement formulator and doesn't just have like six or seven different, you know, degrees in alternative medicine and research and herbology and the rest of it.
[02:33:39.869 --> 02:33:42.729]  He was, you know, in the army in a special task force and he's a smart guy.
[02:33:42.729 --> 02:33:43.670]  I mean, I really respect him.
[02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:44.110]  We're friends.
[02:33:44.110 --> 02:33:49.931]  He comes to town, we go to dinner, you know, he and I and his wife and friends.
[02:33:49.931 --> 02:33:53.011]  But we don't hate the Muslims.
[02:33:53.011 --> 02:33:55.332]  We're not here to have a clash of civilizations.
[02:33:55.332 --> 02:33:56.872]  The globalists want that, but I see
[02:33:58.587 --> 02:34:22.718]  Every day, in the U.S., in Europe, in Canada, with straight faces, classes where you convert to Islam, classes where the girls wear hajibs, and where they push this culture, and the weird left actually supports it and defends it, but hates Christian Western values that truly liberalize women's rights.
[02:34:27.039 --> 02:34:29.220]  You know, they claim they're trying to illuminate the world.
[02:34:29.220 --> 02:34:30.700]  You know, the Illuminati, the all-seeing eye.
[02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:34.561]  Well, you go back to the Old Testament God's described, you know, as an all-seeing eye.
[02:34:34.561 --> 02:34:37.902]  They've just expropriated that symbol.
[02:34:37.902 --> 02:34:41.782]  And they've expropriated the fact that they're the people for free will or freedom.
[02:34:41.782 --> 02:34:44.043]  Everything they run, they bring total tyranny in.
[02:34:44.043 --> 02:34:47.864]  And the Republicans are just a fake brand of them claiming to be, quote, conservative.
[02:34:47.864 --> 02:34:49.964]  What does that mean?
[02:34:49.964 --> 02:34:51.985]  Put this new article up on Infowars.com.
[02:34:51.985 --> 02:34:52.825]  Homework assignment.
[02:34:52.825 --> 02:34:54.886]  Tell your parents you're converting to Islam.
[02:34:54.886 --> 02:34:56.466]  It's all just to screw with everybody.
[02:34:57.961 --> 02:35:03.228]  This is on the island of Guernsey off England.
[02:35:03.228 --> 02:35:11.238]  Miss Amber Stables, the school's religious education teacher.
[02:35:11.238 --> 02:35:13.541]  And again, this is all social justice warrior stuff.
[02:35:14.329 --> 02:35:15.169]  to empathize
[02:35:36.878 --> 02:35:49.104]  Dr. Ebergroup, what he thinks about this, I mean, obviously they're trying to get civil wars going and then use the crisis they bring in to take liberties like Europe's done, but is the public that dumb to not see what's happening?
[02:35:49.104 --> 02:35:54.207]  But what does it tell us about our rulers that they would bring the most incompatible, most unliberal,
[02:35:55.285 --> 02:36:02.348]  Freak show radicals in here that mutilate their women, that treat them as slaves, and man, have you talked about this?
[02:36:02.348 --> 02:36:11.492]  The left attacks me so hard and says I'm quote racist because I don't support radical Wahhabism and keeping women as pet slaves.
[02:36:11.492 --> 02:36:13.253]  I mean, what is going on here?
[02:36:15.157 --> 02:36:19.239]  Well, I think it's a combination of multiple things.
[02:36:19.239 --> 02:36:21.920]  It's the spoken hub model of destruction, really.
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:37.646]  You have chemicals, you have fear-mongering, you have negativity, you have religious war, you have contamination of the food supply, you have oil and gas, you have financial structures that you can manipulate.
[02:36:37.646 --> 02:36:39.727]  So when you put all of those things together,
[02:36:40.547 --> 02:37:04.953]  It just falls into the control and the general plan of where they want to go with reducing the population, creating war, creating sickness, creating the fact that they can control everybody by poisoning you, or now even using genetically modified insects and viruses and everything else, different types of implant systems so they can track you everywhere you go.
[02:37:04.953 --> 02:37:07.274]  I mean, it's just one more thing in the big
[02:37:08.855 --> 02:37:14.344]  wheel of change that they're trying, the globalists are trying to portray on us.
[02:37:14.344 --> 02:37:17.569]  I mean, especially with, you know, the Jihad.
[02:37:17.569 --> 02:37:20.895]  Look, God doesn't want us to kill each other.
[02:37:21.832 --> 02:37:28.698]  And any religion, in my view, that promotes killing another human being, there's gotta be something wrong with it.
[02:37:28.698 --> 02:37:39.046]  I mean, you know, I come from the training that Christian philosophy of love everybody as your brother, you know, treat thy neighbor as thyself.
[02:37:39.747 --> 02:37:44.508]  You know, don't kill, don't do any of these different types of activities.
[02:37:44.508 --> 02:37:46.569]  And let's be clear, do not commit murder.
[02:37:46.569 --> 02:37:51.190]  It's perfectly Christian to defend yourself or if an army is attacking you, be in your army and fight back.
[02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:56.152]  But don't say, because somebody is such and such, it's okay to go out and kill them.
[02:37:56.152 --> 02:37:58.572]  And that's what their interpretations of Islam is.
[02:37:58.572 --> 02:38:00.813]  And that Islam is taking over Islam.
[02:38:00.813 --> 02:38:02.273]  I mean, the debate is almost over.
[02:38:02.273 --> 02:38:04.194]  And our government is backing radical Islam.
[02:38:06.069 --> 02:38:22.231]  Well yeah, I think that's been going on for quite some time now and it's a war against Christians and they know a religious war, they can create fear and create anger within people and if they do that their immune systems are going to go down, they're going to stay sick and
[02:38:23.206 --> 02:38:33.929]  You know, they're kind of out of it in a way, except for the fact that the bankers and the, you know, big corporations that are producing all the military equipment are making lots of money.
[02:38:33.929 --> 02:38:38.030]  So it's a psych warfare program to break our will and demoralize us.
[02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:39.911]  And, you know, it doesn't have that effect on me.
[02:38:39.911 --> 02:38:41.611]  It makes me want to fight back and resist.
[02:38:41.611 --> 02:38:43.652]  And folks need to get out of the thing of like, oh, it's overwhelming.
[02:38:43.652 --> 02:38:44.652]  Oh, it's horrible.
[02:38:44.652 --> 02:38:45.493]  And not be in fear.
[02:38:45.493 --> 02:38:46.853]  Say, I'm going to do something about it.
[02:38:46.853 --> 02:38:49.674]  Get in power and realize that literally
[02:38:50.957 --> 02:38:53.148]  We're turning into a new paradigm.
[02:38:53.148 --> 02:38:54.816]  And that's what makes them so scared, Dr. Group.
[02:38:56.104 --> 02:38:56.664]  That is.
[02:38:56.664 --> 02:39:01.487]  I mean, people are starting to, you know, we see the change that's happening.
[02:39:01.487 --> 02:39:13.294]  For example, a few years back, there was a study done where they took babies, the Journal of Neurotoxology, and they tested the first bowel movement of babies, of 426 infants, and they found 84% contained mercury, 27% contained lead, and 27% had DDT in their bowel movements.
[02:39:13.294 --> 02:39:13.554]  That's crazy!
[02:39:24.252 --> 02:39:29.214]  And then they inject the baby with 36 vaccinations, which contain even more mercury.
[02:39:29.214 --> 02:39:33.635]  So getting to the reason why I'm saying that is because that's how important it is.
[02:39:33.635 --> 02:39:36.476]  This is what's happening to the children that are being born in.
[02:39:36.476 --> 02:39:42.118]  And they're also finding it in the studies you sent me in their blood from the umbilical cord.
[02:39:42.118 --> 02:39:43.238]  I mean, they are being hammered.
[02:39:44.192 --> 02:40:04.881]  Well, they found 76 chemicals linked to cancer, they found 94 chemicals that are toxic to the brain and nervous system, 86 chemicals that interfere with the hormone system, which we talk about a lot, 79 chemicals associated with birth defects, 77 chemicals toxic to the reproductive system, and 77 chemicals toxic to the immune system.
[02:40:04.881 --> 02:40:13.445]  It was 167 different chemicals they found with an average of 91 industrial toxins in each person they tested.
[02:40:14.448 --> 02:40:43.433]  Now, that leads me even to the state that, yes, there was just a Wall Street Journal article that came out about the FDA testing for glyphosate, finally, and the reason why they're doing it was because all of the activist groups, all of the information that we've been putting out on the internet, finally is forcing the big government, I don't know if they're going to do anything about it, but it's finally gaining mainstream news
[02:40:44.420 --> 02:40:55.451]  So, we know how damaging glyphosate is, so that's a great step forward in ultimately getting that taken out altogether.
[02:40:55.451 --> 02:40:59.996]  It seemed like it was impossible 10 years ago, 20 years ago, to expose glyphosate.
[02:40:59.996 --> 02:41:02.419]  They said, oh, you can drink it, it's good for you.
[02:41:02.419 --> 02:41:06.222]  The famous lobbyist that says that, they go, here's some on TV, you think I'm crazy?
[02:41:07.023 --> 02:41:12.548]  And then now they're admitting it's causing cancer, they admit it grows tumors, they've known that forever, but now they're in trouble.
[02:41:12.548 --> 02:41:15.651]  This is part of a population control agenda, obviously.
[02:41:15.651 --> 02:41:19.094]  What do you expect to happen to Monsanto?
[02:41:19.094 --> 02:41:20.115]  Where do you see all this going?
[02:41:21.857 --> 02:41:43.226]  Well, I would be extremely happy if Monsanto either went bankrupt and no longer existed for the damage or they had to fork out billions and trillions and trillions of dollars for cleanup projects to clean up all the damage they've done to the environment and pay everybody off for the infertility and the sterility that they've caused.
[02:41:43.786 --> 02:41:49.750]  And the toxic endocrine disrupting problems for the animals and the humans.
[02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:55.674]  But ultimately I see that the way that we're going it all goes back to consumer demand.
[02:41:55.674 --> 02:42:00.878]  You talked about McDonald's and now McDonald's is planning on introducing some certified organic things.
[02:42:00.878 --> 02:42:05.762]  So the more the public steps forward and says we're not going to use your chemicals anymore.
[02:42:05.762 --> 02:42:07.143]  We have the power of choice.
[02:42:07.143 --> 02:42:08.564]  They try to convince us we don't.
[02:42:08.564 --> 02:42:08.904]  We do.
[02:42:09.994 --> 02:42:11.115]  That's right, that's right.
[02:42:11.115 --> 02:42:20.141]  And just like the antibacterial soaps, I mean, we've been talking about the damaging effects of cosmetics, the triclosan in there, the endocrine disruption.
[02:42:20.141 --> 02:42:22.762]  Yeah, let's talk about that new Wall Street Journal article.
[02:42:22.762 --> 02:42:24.223]  Are antibacterial soaps safe?
[02:42:24.223 --> 02:42:27.786]  We've known for decades that it's linked to infertility, correct?
[02:42:28.766 --> 02:42:29.246]  Yeah, it is.
[02:42:29.246 --> 02:42:37.954]  I mean, how many times do people use hand sanitizers, they use soaps, they use toxic shampoos, toxic conditioners, toxic lotions.
[02:42:37.954 --> 02:42:42.137]  They all pretty much fall in the same category because they have the same toxic compounds in them.
[02:42:42.137 --> 02:42:45.080]  They have fragrances, which are carcinogenic phthalates.
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:52.244]  They have triclosan, they have a propylene glycol, they have a lot of different damaging chemicals.
[02:42:52.244 --> 02:42:59.567]  Of course, the EPA and the falsified research in the past has said that they're safe to use, but now we know that they're not.
[02:42:59.567 --> 02:43:13.115]  And that's another kind of a short victory for us, because now the FDA has required that by September of this year, all of these companies are going to have to prove and demonstrate that their products are safe.
[02:43:13.855 --> 02:43:16.196]  And more effective than just plain soap and water.
[02:43:16.196 --> 02:43:27.640]  Now that's what I grew up on is just plain soap and plain water and of course you know there's huge markets out there for these hand sanitizers and everything else that they have to include all these toxic chemicals in.
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:33.762]  So this could affect millions of Americans and we're already seeing some of these major corporations
[02:43:34.682 --> 02:43:35.723]  Thank you.
[02:43:54.338 --> 02:43:56.160]  They say, why don't you get into politics?
[02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:57.481]  Why don't you try to run for office?
[02:43:57.481 --> 02:43:59.142]  Then you can create change.
[02:43:59.142 --> 02:44:00.844]  You don't create change when you're in office.
[02:44:00.844 --> 02:44:02.285]  They tell you what to do.
[02:44:02.285 --> 02:44:04.186]  This is how we create change.
[02:44:04.186 --> 02:44:06.528]  By getting this information out to the masses.
[02:44:06.528 --> 02:44:13.114]  We can do more in one year than someone can sitting in office for 8 years or 16 years.
[02:44:13.114 --> 02:44:18.138]  And that's why they want to ban farmers markets and the war on lemonade stands that even Forbes reported on.
[02:44:18.138 --> 02:44:22.042]  Because normal human activity, us not being domesticated, is the enemy.
[02:44:23.416 --> 02:44:31.626]  I want to get into a plug here because we literally sell out a liver shield for a month, two months, three months because it's so hard to get the ingredients.
[02:44:31.626 --> 02:44:36.972]  It would be our best-selling product if we could keep it in stock, but it is hard to source it right.
[02:44:36.972 --> 02:44:41.397]  Explain why that is, and then let's get into the cleanse and why this is so popular.
[02:44:41.397 --> 02:44:42.198]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:43.427 --> 02:44:51.752]  You can go there, you get it with the oxy powder, then get the apple cider vinegar at the store, and then do the one week cleanse or just do the general liver shield, put it in your water under your tongue.
[02:44:51.752 --> 02:44:52.833]  It has a lot of benefits.
[02:44:52.833 --> 02:44:57.416]  Explain why liver shield has been giving people such dramatic results compared to other liver cleanses.
[02:44:58.390 --> 02:45:14.843]  Well, number one is we've spent 20 years working in refining and we continually look for herbs and methods and ways and technology to improve the effectiveness or the absorption or the quality of the herbs and now we're going into biodynamic growing systems.
[02:45:14.843 --> 02:45:25.211]  We're the only, there's only two organic herb farms in the whole United States that are biodynamic certified and biodynamic is above and beyond so we constantly
[02:45:26.291 --> 02:45:30.154]  You know, our motto is canny, constant and never-ending improvement.
[02:45:30.154 --> 02:45:35.957]  We always want to keep producing the highest quality stuff available and choose the herbs.
[02:45:35.957 --> 02:45:45.184]  We are running into a problem right now where many herbs are becoming extinct and that's why you'll see us change the formulas sometimes and add additional herbs.
[02:45:45.184 --> 02:45:51.548]  But the whole focus is the liver is your main detoxification organ and that's why I feel it's so important.
[02:45:51.548 --> 02:45:54.090]  You have two organs, the intestinal tract and the liver.
[02:45:54.090 --> 02:45:55.851]  If your intestinal tract is healthy,
[02:45:56.691 --> 02:46:08.204]  Digestive health with a good probiotic and clean and you're going to the bathroom on a regular basis, then the liver is the main filtration system in the body.
[02:46:08.204 --> 02:46:09.685]  It detoxifies the blood.
[02:46:09.685 --> 02:46:12.889]  It's a phase 1 and a phase 2 detoxification system.
[02:46:12.889 --> 02:46:18.134]  We talked about how many chemicals they found in the blood system and in the fecal matter of infants.
[02:46:18.775 --> 02:46:19.995]  That's a sign right there.
[02:46:19.995 --> 02:46:21.276]  And those are just two studies.
[02:46:21.276 --> 02:46:28.757]  There's multiple studies out there that have tested for major chemicals, heavy metals, all different types of toxins.
[02:46:28.757 --> 02:46:35.199]  And when we have too many of those, it stresses the liver and causes the liver to become sluggish, fatty.
[02:46:35.199 --> 02:46:38.260]  We're seeing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children 12 years old.
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:39.600]  Yes.
[02:47:10.621 --> 02:47:11.381]  Right, exactly.
[02:47:11.381 --> 02:47:12.081]  So it doesn't matter.
[02:47:12.081 --> 02:47:16.523]  Your weak link is where those toxins are going to be stored, and that's the whole disease process right there.
[02:47:16.523 --> 02:47:24.908]  Well, look, folks who support the broadcast, getting liver, shield, and oxy powder at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:47:24.908 --> 02:47:25.948]  Do the cleanse.
[02:47:25.948 --> 02:47:28.089]  Go read the right reviews.
[02:47:28.089 --> 02:47:36.873]  And if it doesn't work for you, which is about 1% of people, Dr. Group says, and that's my experience, then it must mean you're either incredibly cleaned out or you better go see a doctor right away.
[02:47:36.873 --> 02:47:37.894]  In fact, briefly, Dr. Group,
[02:47:39.577 --> 02:47:43.419]  Going back to this discussion, some people it takes two days, three days after for the flush to happen.
[02:47:43.419 --> 02:47:44.540]  For me, it took a day and a half.
[02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:46.901]  Probably meaning I had some problems.
[02:47:46.901 --> 02:47:49.102]  But it was spectacular.
[02:47:49.102 --> 02:47:51.523]  You know, like 30-something black balls, green balls, you name it.
[02:47:51.523 --> 02:47:53.144]  I don't want to be gross here, but this is medical stuff.
[02:47:53.144 --> 02:47:53.724]  Let's be serious.
[02:47:53.724 --> 02:47:54.905]  This is just facts.
[02:47:54.905 --> 02:47:57.226]  You know, personal stuff that went on.
[02:47:57.226 --> 02:47:59.147]  That's what most people experience they have.
[02:47:59.147 --> 02:48:04.189]  Most folks in the morning, though, what about the 1% of people or so that you've talked about that don't have any
[02:48:05.350 --> 02:48:10.871]  Don't have any visible effect when the gallbladder opens up and all the stuff comes out.
[02:48:12.062 --> 02:48:26.447]  Well, usually, since we know that the liver produces over 500 bodily functions, from regulating blood sugar to the metabolizing of fats, it's one of the best things you can do for weight loss that nobody out there is talking about.
[02:48:26.447 --> 02:48:40.973]  It metabolizes your proteins, your carbohydrates, it stores vitamins and minerals, it works for blood clotting, cholesterol problems, hormones, thyroid function, which is great to use the Survival Shield X2 because everybody's deficient in iodine.
[02:48:41.733 --> 02:48:51.560]  What we found after studying 300,000 cases or more of people going through liver cleansing is that if you don't have results on the first one, something is happening.
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:59.985]  It's got to happen because this technology goes back thousands of years to ancient Ayurvedic technology of oil pulling, which is a hot topic right now.
[02:48:59.985 --> 02:49:07.610]  So usually those individuals, we'll tell them to go ahead and do another one and then do a third liver cleanse.
[02:49:07.610 --> 02:49:11.073]  Very rarely, I can't even think of one case where
[02:49:11.793 --> 02:49:12.113]  I think so.
[02:49:31.926 --> 02:49:33.647]  Boost the liver by about 15%.
[02:49:33.647 --> 02:49:38.249]  So, if you're at 60 and then you do one liver cleanse, then you're going to be at 75.
[02:49:38.249 --> 02:49:40.750]  So, that's why we recommend multiple liver cleanses.
[02:49:40.750 --> 02:49:44.011]  I, myself, do three a year and I can notice a huge difference.
[02:49:44.011 --> 02:49:45.192]  Well, folks, Dr. Group, we're out of time.
[02:49:45.192 --> 02:49:46.392]  And thank you so much for your time, sir.
[02:49:46.392 --> 02:49:49.093]  I know you're busy on your lunch hour with all your patients and folks come join us.

[02:50:00.259 --> 02:50:03.062]  All you've done, you're a godsend to Global Healing Center folks.
[02:50:03.062 --> 02:50:03.883]  This is his operation.
[02:50:03.883 --> 02:50:05.385]  You can find him online.
[02:50:05.385 --> 02:50:11.313]  David Knight's here as well to give us a little sneak peek on what's coming up in the next hour on Scalia and more.
[02:50:11.313 --> 02:50:11.573]  David?
[02:50:12.657 --> 02:50:25.806]  Yeah, we're going to have, Alex, we're going to have Wayne Madsen here with us, Joe Biggs, Kit Daniels, our reporters who are out there with Josh, the cameraman, shooting what was an investigation into the strange things that happened surrounding Scalia's death.
[02:50:25.806 --> 02:50:33.831]  And of course, there's a lot of odd things that happened, but we also learned some interesting details about the airport that's there, about the hotel that's there.
[02:50:33.831 --> 02:50:36.032]  We're about to show all this weird occult stuff you found.
[02:50:36.032 --> 02:50:36.953]  We haven't seen this yet.
[02:50:37.133 --> 02:50:37.533]  Exactly.
[02:50:37.533 --> 02:50:41.656]  We also have an interview that we're going to be playing that Joe Biggs had with Michael Savage.
[02:50:41.656 --> 02:50:43.638]  We've cut that down to about five minutes or so.
[02:50:43.638 --> 02:50:45.499]  We're going to be playing that in the next hour as well.
[02:50:45.499 --> 02:50:47.901]  All right, there it goes.
[02:50:47.901 --> 02:50:49.502]  Dr. Group, I want to thank him.
[02:50:49.502 --> 02:50:53.785]  Coming right back with David Knight to give us a preview of the fourth hour.
[02:50:53.785 --> 02:50:57.949]  And he's going to be running the show with our investigative journalist in studio.

[02:54:10.307 --> 02:54:11.508]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:11.508 --> 02:54:24.313]  I just want to take a moment here to thank the amazing behind-the-scenes crew that runs the show, that does the research, the reporters, everybody in this office, and you, the listeners, our affiliates, our sponsors.
[02:54:24.313 --> 02:54:25.394]  It is humbling.
[02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:31.784]  That you put up with me and that we have such success against tyranny and just know we're trying our best.
[02:54:31.784 --> 02:54:36.568]  We understand the incredible nature of what we face and we're doing the very best we can.
[02:54:36.568 --> 02:54:39.010]  So thank you for working with us and understanding that.
[02:54:39.010 --> 02:54:43.373]  I feel terrible that I can't respond to all the emails and phone calls, even old friends and family.
[02:54:43.373 --> 02:54:43.974]  I'm so busy.
[02:54:43.974 --> 02:54:47.937]  I just know I love you all and I really appreciate you and we're all in this together.
[02:54:47.937 --> 02:54:51.259]  And the next little segment before David Knight takes over, I'm going to talk with David.
[02:54:52.060 --> 02:54:57.388]  about Donald Trump, how bold it is coming out and 9-11 truth.
[02:54:57.388 --> 02:54:59.310]  I mean, plus it's proven fact.
[02:54:59.310 --> 02:55:03.256]  I mean, he's really, really calling them out here, the Emperor's New Clothes.
[02:55:03.256 --> 02:55:06.040]  And then we're going to have the Michael Savage interview.
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:06.721]  We're going to have
[02:55:07.802 --> 02:55:17.631]  Just a great roundtable discussion with Wayne Madsen in here, with David Dye in the main studio, the War Room and the Situation Room, Joe Beggs, Kit Daniels, and others.
[02:55:17.631 --> 02:55:18.512]  So this is going to be big.
[02:55:18.512 --> 02:55:19.633]  I'd like to get Josh Owens too.
[02:55:19.633 --> 02:55:22.556]  I mean, he's a really smart guy with commentary.
[02:55:22.556 --> 02:55:24.318]  But we did what the mainstream media wouldn't do.
[02:55:24.958 --> 02:55:27.519]  And so it's going to be a jam-packed transmission.
[02:55:27.519 --> 02:55:28.939]  Scalia's lying in state right now.
[02:55:28.939 --> 02:55:31.660]  Obama did go to visit that, but he's not going to the funeral.
[02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:38.561]  David Knight has footage they're going to premiere of the bizarre occultic stuff that was beyond Day of the Dead in a very, very creepy area.
[02:55:38.561 --> 02:55:39.942]  So we're really investigating this.
[02:55:39.942 --> 02:55:41.962]  They're saying, how dare we investigate it.
[02:55:41.962 --> 02:55:45.783]  And David, getting into this occultic art and other points that are coming up in the next hour.
[02:55:46.443 --> 02:55:49.247]  Well, Alex, they had a lot of different types of art there, to be fair.
[02:55:49.247 --> 02:55:59.140]  They had a lot of Southwestern art, they had a lot of Mexican art, but every night we were there, we had this, all these masks that were staring down us, these satanic masks that they use as part of Mexican festivals.
[02:55:59.140 --> 02:56:01.463]  It was like, okay, a bit creepy, we're used to it.
[02:56:01.883 --> 02:56:13.467]  Then, right outside our room, as I'm talking to my wife, I look over to my right and I see this really over-the-top statue of devils and demons and human sacrifice and stuff, and it's like, wow, this is really amazing.
[02:56:13.467 --> 02:56:14.947]  So we got some pictures of that.
[02:56:14.947 --> 02:56:16.208]  But here's the thing, Alex.
[02:56:16.208 --> 02:56:18.348]  I'm tired of being called a conspiracy theorist.
[02:56:18.348 --> 02:56:20.449]  I understand that's the avenue of attack.
[02:56:20.449 --> 02:56:23.770]  We don't have any theories about how Scalia died.
[02:56:24.090 --> 02:56:28.152]  The people who came up with the theories were this judge who phoned it in.
[02:56:28.152 --> 02:56:31.714]  Phoned in the inquest, didn't look, said, oh, it's a heart attack, then said it was natural causes.
[02:56:31.714 --> 02:56:33.075]  There's some of the drone footage behind you.
[02:56:33.075 --> 02:56:33.776]  Go ahead.
[02:56:33.776 --> 02:56:36.577]  Actually, you know, what we are, we're skeptical, Alex.
[02:56:36.577 --> 02:56:38.899]  We don't believe everything the government tells us.
[02:56:38.899 --> 02:56:48.304]  And when they start changing their stories about the cause of death, when they start changing their stories about his health, we're going to be looking at the circuitous route that they took the hearse on.
[02:56:48.304 --> 02:56:52.046]  We're going to be looking at the airport that was right across from the ranch itself.
[02:56:52.046 --> 02:56:53.207]  This whole thing is suspicious.
[02:56:53.647 --> 02:56:54.948]  Everything about that is suspicious.
[02:56:54.948 --> 02:56:56.770]  And this is an airport for wide-body jets.
[02:56:56.770 --> 02:56:57.450]  I mean, it's big.
[02:56:57.450 --> 02:56:57.731]  Yes.
[02:56:57.731 --> 02:57:00.693]  Gulfstream jets are able to land there.
[02:57:00.693 --> 02:57:04.977]  They could have flown his body back in less time than they drove it around Texas.
[02:57:04.977 --> 02:57:07.679]  There's a lot of different issues here that don't make any sense.
[02:57:07.679 --> 02:57:08.940]  Changing the stories.
[02:57:08.940 --> 02:57:11.703]  You busted into the judge's office and talked to him.
[02:57:11.703 --> 02:57:12.103]  Yeah.
[02:57:12.103 --> 02:57:13.744]  Talked to the other judge.
[02:57:13.744 --> 02:57:16.527]  You guys did a first-rate job for, like, 2020.
[02:57:16.527 --> 02:57:18.989]  And you did it with a shoestring budget in just a few days.
[02:57:18.989 --> 02:57:19.950]  I mean, congratulations.
[02:57:20.430 --> 02:57:23.832]  I'm telling you, man, I tell you, I mean, you deserve an award if there was one.
[02:57:23.832 --> 02:57:24.272]  Well, thank you.
[02:57:24.272 --> 02:57:25.873]  There's rewards to defeating tyranny.
[02:57:25.873 --> 02:57:27.774]  There's still some things that we don't have answers to.
[02:57:27.774 --> 02:57:33.338]  I wanted to talk to people who were there within the local government, if they would be honest and candid and open with us.
[02:57:33.338 --> 02:57:40.102]  I wanted to ask them what the federal involvement was in this, because all we hear about are what the sheriff did, what the judge did, who phoned in the inquest.
[02:57:40.102 --> 02:57:44.224]  I would like to know what the federals did with all of this, because that's a key part of the story.
[02:57:44.264 --> 02:57:45.165]  But none of us know.
[02:57:45.165 --> 02:57:55.512]  We know more with the custody of a robbery victim or a dead illegal that dies down there with an autopsy, which should happen, than we do with this key Supreme Court justice.
[02:57:55.512 --> 02:57:56.653]  They say, oh, he was real sick.
[02:57:56.653 --> 02:57:57.354]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:57:57.354 --> 02:57:57.894]  But he wasn't.
[02:57:57.894 --> 02:57:59.856]  I mean, what does your gut now tell you?
[02:57:59.856 --> 02:58:01.117]  You've been down there and investigated it.
[02:58:01.117 --> 02:58:02.277]  It's something nobody else has done.
[02:58:03.118 --> 02:58:11.403]  Well, my gut tells me that they really did not want to have an autopsy done because they went to great lengths to make sure an autopsy was not done.
[02:58:11.403 --> 02:58:16.046]  We had the first two judges that we talked to said, well, I pass it on to another person because I couldn't go.
[02:58:16.046 --> 02:58:18.007]  The next judge said the same thing, I couldn't go.
[02:58:18.007 --> 02:58:31.396]  This one phones it in, has a history of doing this, and as we were doing that first interview with you live on the radio, we had people on the sidewalk listening to what we were saying, didn't know who we were, and then came up to me afterwards, pulled me off to the side and said,
[02:58:31.496 --> 02:58:35.681]  You know, I want to remain anonymous, but I got to tell you, this is not the first time this type of thing has happened here.
[02:58:35.681 --> 02:58:37.584]  And then you talk to the sheriff's deputy that says the same thing.
[02:58:37.584 --> 02:58:38.585]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:38.585 --> 02:58:41.409]  I'll be back this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m., and I'm hosting.
[02:58:41.409 --> 02:58:42.570]  4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:42.570 --> 02:58:43.832]  with the Sunday transmission.
[02:58:43.832 --> 02:58:45.554]  Fourth hour, straight ahead.
[02:58:45.554 --> 02:58:46.535]  So folks, tune in, folks.
[02:58:48.447 --> 02:58:54.193]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[02:58:54.193 --> 02:59:08.648]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[02:59:08.888 --> 02:59:16.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[02:59:16.895 --> 02:59:22.340]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[02:59:22.340 --> 02:59:26.023]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[02:59:26.023 --> 02:59:30.167]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[02:59:30.167 --> 02:59:34.031]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[02:59:34.471 --> 02:59:35.772]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:04.159 --> 03:00:06.460]  Evil takes over because we let it.
[03:00:06.460 --> 03:00:11.222]  Thomas Jefferson.
[03:00:11.222 --> 03:00:13.724]  The world is a dangerous place.
[03:00:13.724 --> 03:00:19.706]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:00:19.706 --> 03:00:23.888]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:23.888 --> 03:00:25.629]  We're not backing down!
[03:00:25.629 --> 03:00:32.232]  To the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.232 --> 03:00:33.233]  The song says it all.
[03:00:35.128 --> 03:00:40.509]  The fighting's going on right now.
[03:00:40.509 --> 03:00:41.209]  It's an info war.
[03:00:41.209 --> 03:00:45.210]  They want to make it physical because we're winning, they're losing.
[03:00:45.210 --> 03:00:46.811]  We're not putting a good face on it.
[03:00:46.811 --> 03:00:48.811]  We were losing ten years ago, I told you.
[03:00:48.811 --> 03:00:51.192]  We were neck and neck two years ago, I told you.
[03:00:51.192 --> 03:00:53.652]  We have the enemy on their back.
[03:00:53.652 --> 03:00:58.033]  All we have to do is deal a killer blow.
[03:00:58.033 --> 03:01:00.794]  That blow is against our own cowardice.
[03:01:00.794 --> 03:01:01.454]  Our own laziness.
[03:01:02.898 --> 03:01:05.500]  We have to deal with our lack of will.
[03:01:05.500 --> 03:01:08.923]  We have to fire up our guts and our spirits and ask God for guidance.
[03:01:08.923 --> 03:01:11.665]  The rest will fall in place.
[03:01:11.665 --> 03:01:15.007]  David Knight, you're going to come up with a whole hour with amazing folks.
[03:01:15.007 --> 03:01:16.228]  Wayne Madsen is about to come in here with you.
[03:01:16.228 --> 03:01:20.372]  You're going to clean up all my little pig pen here, my lunch behind the counter, and all the rest of it.
[03:01:20.372 --> 03:01:22.413]  And then you're going to have a deep breakdown of all this.
[03:01:22.413 --> 03:01:24.054]  A lot of special clips.
[03:01:24.054 --> 03:01:27.417]  Michael Savage is going to be on a taped interview with Biggs.
[03:01:28.678 --> 03:01:30.219]  That's all coming up.
[03:01:30.219 --> 03:01:31.320]  Uh, the weird occultic stuff.
[03:01:31.320 --> 03:01:33.042]  You just wanted to say you were glad to get out of that ranch.
[03:01:33.042 --> 03:01:33.662]  It was Creepville.
[03:01:33.662 --> 03:01:34.923]  That was your words during the break.
[03:01:34.923 --> 03:01:35.223]  Yeah.
[03:01:35.223 --> 03:01:35.444]  Yeah.
[03:01:35.444 --> 03:01:38.386]  We were very uncomfortable there, uh, for a number of reasons.
[03:01:38.386 --> 03:01:42.269]  First of all, we weren't welcome, but yeah, there were a lot of things that made us all feel very creepy.
[03:01:42.269 --> 03:01:48.494]  We all said individually, and I even had, when I put out a picture of some of the artwork there, somebody said to me, yeah, this looks like The Shining.
[03:01:48.494 --> 03:01:50.396]  And we had all said that individually.
[03:01:50.836 --> 03:01:57.642]  We need to do an article inside, with a video, inside the bizarre ranch where Scalia died, and then just list, like, ten of the bizarre circumstances.
[03:01:57.642 --> 03:02:04.627]  We got one minute before I go to this clip of Trump, uh, saying, hey, you know, 28 pages, hey, Bush knew, hey, why'd we attack Iraq?
[03:02:04.627 --> 03:02:05.889]  Does that make you like Trump more?
[03:02:05.889 --> 03:02:06.929]  Because I know you've been on the fence with him.
[03:02:06.929 --> 03:02:07.410]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:02:07.410 --> 03:02:08.371]  Let me tell you something.
[03:02:08.371 --> 03:02:09.852]  I was always for Rand Paul.
[03:02:09.852 --> 03:02:12.054]  Civil liberties are at the front of my priorities.
[03:02:12.594 --> 03:02:17.337]  But maybe the way that we attack this police state is by exposing the lies of 9-11.
[03:02:17.337 --> 03:02:20.359]  And if he has the guts to do that, that is huge.
[03:02:20.359 --> 03:02:22.680]  He already opposes the globalist takeover.
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:27.403]  So what, you just went from maybe 60% for Trump to 75%?
[03:02:27.403 --> 03:02:31.265]  Yeah, well you know what, it started turning around for me once Rand Paul was out.
[03:02:32.406 --> 03:02:32.666]  We're good
[03:02:47.441 --> 03:02:52.885]  He's a nationalist, he's not perfect, he's got courage, and he's obviously not with them or he wouldn't be doing this.
[03:02:52.885 --> 03:02:53.846]  It's too devastating.
[03:02:53.846 --> 03:02:54.906]  He's for real.
[03:02:54.906 --> 03:02:55.487]  He's real.
[03:02:55.487 --> 03:02:56.187]  Now, is he perfect?
[03:02:56.187 --> 03:02:57.488]  No, but he's real.
[03:02:57.488 --> 03:03:06.995]  We're going to go to this clip of Trump on CNN, come back, and you're taking over, but address the Trump thing some too with Wayne Madsen and others, because this is seismic, folks, and Donald Trump is for real.
[03:03:06.995 --> 03:03:08.296]  We now know that it's certified.
[03:03:08.296 --> 03:03:09.817]  Let's go to the clip.
[03:03:11.542 --> 03:03:21.929]  When you said that George W. Bush, which was our last Republican president, a man I respect greatly, a person that we really fought for when he was up against a lot of pressure.
[03:03:25.339 --> 03:03:27.920]  To get us in the war in Iraq.
[03:03:27.920 --> 03:03:29.960]  That stung me very deeply.
[03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:32.561]  I don't believe that.
[03:03:32.561 --> 03:03:38.122]  I'm just wondering, given some time passing, perhaps you've rethought that?
[03:03:38.122 --> 03:03:40.082]  Would you be willing to rethink that?
[03:03:40.082 --> 03:03:45.424]  Well, a lot of people agree with what I said, and I'm not talking about lying, I'm not talking about not lying.
[03:03:45.424 --> 03:03:48.064]  Nobody really knows why we went into Iraq.
[03:03:48.064 --> 03:03:51.925]  The Iraqis did not knock down, it was not Saddam Hussein that knocked down the World Trade Center.
[03:03:52.766 --> 03:03:58.490]  What you said was they lied, they said there were weapons of mass destruction, and there were none, and they knew there were none, there were no weapons of mass destruction.
[03:03:58.490 --> 03:03:59.911]  Well, there were a lot of people that think that.
[03:03:59.911 --> 03:04:01.052]  There were a lot of people that think that.
[03:04:01.052 --> 03:04:03.174]  Look, bottom line, there were no weapons of mass destruction.
[03:04:03.174 --> 03:04:05.476]  They said there were weapons of mass destruction.
[03:04:05.476 --> 03:04:07.197]  I was against the war when it started.
[03:04:07.197 --> 03:04:12.241]  So do you think the President of the United States, George W. Bush, lied?
[03:04:12.241 --> 03:04:14.403]  Well, look, I'm not going to get your vote, but that's okay.
[03:04:14.403 --> 03:04:15.524]  I'm just giving you another shot at it.
[03:04:15.524 --> 03:04:16.104]  Let me tell you something.
[03:04:16.104 --> 03:04:16.985]  I'll tell you very simply.
[03:04:18.596 --> 03:04:25.661]  It may have been the worst decision going into Iraq, may have been the worst decision anybody has made, any president has made in the history of this country.
[03:04:25.661 --> 03:04:27.362]  That's how bad it is, okay?
[03:04:27.362 --> 03:04:28.563]  Here's what happens.
[03:04:28.563 --> 03:04:32.045]  We have spent two trillion dollars in Iraq, in fighting Iraq.
[03:04:32.045 --> 03:04:32.866]  Two trillion!
[03:04:32.866 --> 03:04:33.906]  Two trillion!
[03:04:33.906 --> 03:04:36.388]  Thousands of lives, right?
[03:04:36.388 --> 03:04:38.329]  We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place.
[03:04:38.329 --> 03:04:39.230]  These are the most incredible.
[03:04:39.230 --> 03:04:41.632]  These are braver than all of us in this room put together.
[03:04:41.632 --> 03:04:44.794]  I look at the attitude, and I work with them, and these are great people.
[03:04:45.549 --> 03:04:46.691]  We got nothing.
[03:04:46.691 --> 03:04:47.652]  We have nothing.
[03:04:47.652 --> 03:04:48.313]  We're not even there.
[03:04:48.313 --> 03:04:49.875]  We can't even make a phone call right now.
[03:04:49.875 --> 03:04:52.419]  But to his question... I'm trying to separate... Let me tell you.
[03:04:52.419 --> 03:04:53.099]  Do I know?
[03:04:53.099 --> 03:04:55.483]  Do you believe he lied or did he... I can tell you this.
[03:04:55.483 --> 03:04:56.925]  I don't... whether he lied or not.
[03:04:58.377 --> 03:05:01.878]  When you talk about leveling with the American people, have you always told the truth?
[03:05:01.878 --> 03:05:02.678]  I've always tried to.
[03:05:02.678 --> 03:05:06.299]  I'm George Washington and I try not to tell lies.
[03:05:06.299 --> 03:05:08.339]  Leanne McAdoo with Infowars.com.
[03:05:08.339 --> 03:05:10.060]  Let me level with you, America.
[03:05:10.060 --> 03:05:12.780]  Here's just a small sampling of Hillary's whoppers.
[03:05:12.780 --> 03:05:20.702]  There's the Benghazi hearing, using a secret private server to hide her activities, lying about not sharing classified information on that secret server.
[03:05:20.982 --> 03:05:25.905]  Using the Clinton Foundation as a cover for tax evasion and taking bribes from foreign countries.
[03:05:25.905 --> 03:05:33.349]  She claims to be against the big banks, but won't release transcripts of the speeches she made to those banks who paid her hefty speaking fees.
[03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:42.093]  Whitewater, Watergate, defending a rapist, threatening all of Bill's bimbos in an effort to keep them quiet, then claiming to run a campaign for women.
[03:05:42.093 --> 03:05:48.197]  Clinton even took $190,000 worth of household goods from the White House when Bill left office.
[03:05:48.737 --> 03:05:50.763]  I guess they weren't dead broke at the time.
[03:05:50.763 --> 03:05:53.370]  What difference at this point does it make?

[03:07:51.021 --> 03:07:57.043]  I'm Alex Jones for Super Mel Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com, and I salute you, our supporters!
[03:08:10.942 --> 03:08:16.608]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:08:16.608 --> 03:08:18.731]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:08:50.832 --> 03:08:53.594]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:53.594 --> 03:09:04.642]  I'm David Knight, your host, and joining me now is Wayne Madsen as well as our reporters who went with us to West Texas to investigate the hotel where Antonin Scalia died.
[03:09:04.642 --> 03:09:07.684]  Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels will be joining us as well.
[03:09:07.684 --> 03:09:12.608]  We're also going to have a clip from the interview that Michael Savage had with Joe Biggs.
[03:09:12.608 --> 03:09:17.851]  Before we get into the Scalia death and the investigation that we did there, Wayne, I want to ask you.
[03:09:18.672 --> 03:09:24.063]  What do you make of the fact that Donald Trump is now talking about the missing pages from 9-11?
[03:09:25.014 --> 03:09:31.900]  Well, he's certainly talking about something that no other candidate would even think about delving into.
[03:09:31.900 --> 03:09:33.682]  Most of all, Jeb Bush.
[03:09:33.682 --> 03:09:34.923]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[03:09:34.923 --> 03:09:35.503]  He avoided that.
[03:09:35.503 --> 03:09:42.189]  His family, of course, has a lot of reasons to keep that information secret.
[03:09:42.189 --> 03:09:50.177]  I think Trump is starting to even be more open about what he thinks about
[03:09:50.964 --> 03:09:54.847]  What's wrong with this country that even H. Ross Perot was?
[03:09:54.847 --> 03:09:55.567]  Oh, I think so.
[03:09:55.567 --> 03:09:57.249]  Very much so, yeah.
[03:09:57.249 --> 03:10:01.932]  Perot, of course, also fed on a lot of discontent.
[03:10:01.932 --> 03:10:07.657]  But Trump has done a couple of things here that I think are interesting.
[03:10:07.657 --> 03:10:18.325]  Not only is he basically overthrowing the Republican Party establishment, and Sanders is doing it for other reasons on the Democratic side.
[03:10:19.207 --> 03:10:26.571]  But he's also, he was ruled out by all the political professionals last year.
[03:10:26.571 --> 03:10:30.053]  Every time he made some controversial statement he said, that's it, he's done.
[03:10:30.053 --> 03:10:33.334]  When he went after McCain and other things.
[03:10:33.334 --> 03:10:38.077]  He's probably going to destroy the professional political consultants.
[03:10:38.917 --> 03:10:44.079]  The advertising, political advertising consultants, because he's... Oh yeah, it's not having any effect.
[03:10:44.079 --> 03:10:46.180]  They've spent hundreds of millions of dollars for Jeb Bush.
[03:10:46.180 --> 03:10:47.920]  He came in with this massive war chest.
[03:10:47.920 --> 03:10:50.001]  That was supposed to scare all the competition away.
[03:10:50.001 --> 03:10:53.502]  He's spent most of it now and it hasn't done anything for him.
[03:10:53.502 --> 03:10:54.342]  Absolutely.
[03:10:54.342 --> 03:11:02.385]  Trump says he spent $5 million, whereas Jeb has wasted $140 million at least.
[03:11:02.385 --> 03:11:07.427]  And if this is the case, if Trump wins South Carolina, which it looks like he's going to do,
[03:11:07.987 --> 03:11:08.067]  Yes.
[03:11:23.337 --> 03:11:27.700]  All I need is a Twitter account, a Facebook page, and, you know, a website.
[03:11:27.700 --> 03:11:30.542]  Because that's basically how he's getting his message across.
[03:11:30.542 --> 03:11:34.365]  I think that's a key part of what's going on with both his campaign and Sanders' campaign.
[03:11:34.365 --> 03:11:48.275]  The fact that people are able to get the news directly, they're able to bypass and are more and more willing to bypass the established mainstream media and get their information directly from the candidates, get it from alternative sources to make up their own minds and do their own research.
[03:11:48.275 --> 03:11:51.398]  And that's really what we're trying to do with this investigation.
[03:11:52.038 --> 03:11:56.061]  I don't have any conspiracy theories about how Antonin Scalia died.
[03:11:56.061 --> 03:12:02.586]  I am skeptic of the various stories that we've heard, which they're conflicting with each other, that have been offered by the government.
[03:12:02.586 --> 03:12:07.809]  I don't think that it, you know, you don't become a conspiracy theorist simply because you're a skeptic.
[03:12:07.809 --> 03:12:09.310]  You want to see a criminal investigation.
[03:12:09.310 --> 03:12:12.753]  Since when is a criminal investigation a conspiracy theory?
[03:12:12.753 --> 03:12:13.333]  It's not!
[03:12:13.333 --> 03:12:16.916]  We should have an investigation to rule out criminal actions.
[03:12:16.916 --> 03:12:18.637]  That's not a theory being offered.
[03:12:18.997 --> 03:12:19.697]  Absolutely.
[03:12:19.697 --> 03:12:25.778]  And the thing is, without the autopsy, there's going to be questions, obviously, raised.
[03:12:25.778 --> 03:12:34.620]  And even those who are dismissing the idea that there was foul play involved are saying, well, why wasn't there an autopsy?
[03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:37.301]  There's so many aspects to this story.
[03:12:37.301 --> 03:12:42.862]  But even the Washington Post, which only really exists in Washington, D.C., to shoot down
[03:12:43.442 --> 03:12:43.722]  I don't
[03:13:01.743 --> 03:13:11.549]  Uh, day, weekend, uh, at this secluded ranch, out in the middle of nowhere, where you have to sign a waiver, uh, over the medical issue.
[03:13:11.549 --> 03:13:11.649]  Yeah.
[03:13:11.649 --> 03:13:12.629]  There's no medical.
[03:13:12.629 --> 03:13:13.770]  You have to sign a waiver.
[03:13:13.770 --> 03:13:18.753]  All of us had to sign a waiver when we went in there, saying that we acknowledge that there's no medical help for ours.
[03:13:19.173 --> 03:13:25.481]  We know that people are coming to this ranch to engage in physical activities like whale hunting, horseback riding, ATV riding, okay?
[03:13:25.481 --> 03:13:26.201]  All of this stuff.
[03:13:26.201 --> 03:13:37.034]  So all of that brings to question the stories about his particular health, okay, that we've heard, as well as what was really happening at the ranch.
[03:13:37.034 --> 03:13:38.015]  And you've got a story about that.
[03:13:38.015 --> 03:13:39.317]  We're going to talk about that in detail.
[03:13:39.557 --> 03:13:45.261]  I want to bring in our other reporters who are also joining us from the Situation Room, Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels.
[03:13:45.261 --> 03:13:57.230]  Give us your quick take on what you think behind the Trump exposure of the missing pages, calling out the Bush family for being liars about the weapons of mass destruction.
[03:13:57.898 --> 03:13:59.478]  Thank you, David.
[03:13:59.478 --> 03:14:02.739]  I think it's exceptionally great that he is doing that.
[03:14:02.739 --> 03:14:10.201]  You know, I was more, like you said, on Rand Paul's side, and now that he's out, there's really nowhere else to look other than Donald Trump.
[03:14:10.201 --> 03:14:14.622]  And the fact that he's coming out, he's willing to put himself out there, make himself a target.
[03:14:14.622 --> 03:14:18.363]  And he has made himself a target by bringing up the situation with the 28 pages.
[03:14:20.524 --> 03:14:35.428]  It's unprecedented to see someone like this, a candidate running for this position, for President of the United States, and seeing him coming out, hitting hard, going after the Pope when the Pope attacks him, you know, going after the Bush family, going after the Clintons.
[03:14:35.428 --> 03:14:40.810]  You know, I'm moving up too as far as, you know, my wanting to back Donald Trump.
[03:14:40.810 --> 03:14:47.432]  I think he's doing some amazing stuff now, you know, his unfiltered view on the world and how he gets up there and says what he wants.
[03:14:48.513 --> 03:14:50.374]  I believe he's going to do some great stuff for America.
[03:14:50.374 --> 03:14:51.115]  What do you think?
[03:14:51.115 --> 03:14:55.079]  Yeah, I think it's really key that he's got a very unfiltered view of the world.
[03:14:55.079 --> 03:15:00.465]  I mean, most politicians, when you see them in a general election, there's always something that's off-limits for all of them to talk about.
[03:15:00.465 --> 03:15:04.388]  I think even in the 90s and 92 when Bill Clinton and George H.W.
[03:15:04.388 --> 03:15:10.254]  Bush were running against each other, they had a gentleman's agreement not to talk about the sub scandal they had going on in Arkansas about guns.
[03:15:11.255 --> 03:15:14.357]  And I think at the time that's what it was.
[03:15:14.357 --> 03:15:15.398]  But yeah, it's great.
[03:15:15.398 --> 03:15:16.798]  He's talking about 28 pages.
[03:15:16.798 --> 03:15:23.202]  That's typically something that's completely off limits for any politician, no matter what kind of election you're running, to talk about.
[03:15:23.202 --> 03:15:26.944]  I mean, even like in a local county commissioner, you can't talk about 9-11.
[03:15:26.944 --> 03:15:29.226]  You're going to get run out of office.
[03:15:29.226 --> 03:15:40.052]  So he's really kind of pushing the Overton window, like I've said before, about what politicians are allowed to say that's not going to kill them in the election and in the polls.
[03:15:40.834 --> 03:15:44.758]  That's weird because anytime I've ever spoke to any kind of political person, it's always going to be off record.
[03:15:44.758 --> 03:15:47.781]  They'll kind of be like, you know, we watch a show or, you know, we agree with this.
[03:15:47.781 --> 03:15:55.569]  This is the first time I've seen a candidate, someone in this position with this kind of power, this kind of a social pull, so to say, to actually come out
[03:15:56.229 --> 03:16:01.771]  And hard charge these issues, really important issues that Americans should be concerned about.
[03:16:01.771 --> 03:16:06.052]  I mean, the fact that he's saying, hey, if I'm elected president, I'm going to give you the information.
[03:16:06.052 --> 03:16:08.113]  You're going to know who brought down those towers.
[03:16:08.113 --> 03:16:11.714]  And like you said, Iraq, Saddam Hussein, nothing to do with it.
[03:16:11.714 --> 03:16:16.196]  I think the key thing, let me break in here quickly, Joe and Kit.
[03:16:16.196 --> 03:16:19.337]  I think the key thing with this, too, for me is, as I said before,
[03:16:20.137 --> 03:16:24.281]  I'm very much interested in shutting down the attacks on our civil liberties.
[03:16:24.281 --> 03:16:25.983]  But where did they all begin?
[03:16:25.983 --> 03:16:27.585]  They all began with 9-11.
[03:16:27.585 --> 03:16:33.110]  That was always the basis for, well, we have to take all of your freedoms, we have to shut down the Constitution, because 9-11.
[03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:39.617]  If the people understand that they have been lied to, that the basis of the security state
[03:16:40.197 --> 03:16:41.298]  Is a lie.
[03:16:41.298 --> 03:16:42.419]  That is huge.
[03:16:42.419 --> 03:16:44.481]  And so, that is a key thing.
[03:16:44.481 --> 03:16:51.286]  If he will attack on that particular basis and say, you've got these pages that you're not releasing, let us see that.
[03:16:51.286 --> 03:16:55.109]  And he's already called out Jeb Bush on lying about weapons of mass destruction.
[03:16:55.109 --> 03:17:00.874]  It's amazing to me that he would get booed for that at the GOP debate because everybody knows that it was based on a lie.
[03:17:00.874 --> 03:17:04.697]  Do you think it was a smart play, though, David, for him to come out now and say that?
[03:17:04.697 --> 03:17:09.481]  Or do you think he should have waited until, you know, maybe after he wins the election, possibly?
[03:17:09.861 --> 03:17:21.608]  No, I think he should do it right now because I think it's going to, look, when he called out, regardless of what happens with the 9-11 issue, a lot of people, most people don't realize there are missing pages from the 9-11 report that have not been released.
[03:17:21.608 --> 03:17:24.369]  They don't realize that congressmen have wanted to see that as well.
[03:17:24.369 --> 03:17:26.410]  So I think that's very important to get that on the table.
[03:17:26.410 --> 03:17:33.254]  But everybody knows that the weapons of mass destruction lie, the basis of Iraq, they all know that that was a lie.
[03:17:33.254 --> 03:17:34.315]  To call him out on that,
[03:17:34.935 --> 03:17:39.337]  Gives him stature that he did not have before in a lot of people's eyes.
[03:17:39.337 --> 03:17:44.380]  In terms of my viewpoint, it gave Trump a great deal of stature to call out Jeb on those lies.
[03:17:44.380 --> 03:17:45.140]  What do you think, Wayne?
[03:17:45.140 --> 03:17:46.601]  Well, think of something else here.
[03:17:46.601 --> 03:17:52.784]  Trump is a major real estate developer in New York City, especially Manhattan.
[03:17:52.784 --> 03:17:55.766]  He's been in this game for a long, long time.
[03:17:55.766 --> 03:17:57.907]  He knows all the players.
[03:17:57.907 --> 03:18:02.790]  He knows a lot about the World Trade Center from the time it was being built.
[03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:11.214]  And so, you know, we have Bloomberg, for example, threatening to get in because he doesn't like Trump.
[03:18:11.214 --> 03:18:11.994]  Yeah.
[03:18:11.994 --> 03:18:15.156]  And Trump doesn't really care for him, I guess.
[03:18:15.156 --> 03:18:23.000]  But Bloomberg's friend is Larry Silverstein, who, of course, was the guy who... Pull it down.
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:24.441]  Yeah, pull it down.
[03:18:24.441 --> 03:18:27.282]  So what is Bloomberg so afraid of here?
[03:18:27.282 --> 03:18:32.505]  Is he afraid that possibly, you know, the next thing Trump's going to talk about is Building 7?
[03:18:34.766 --> 03:18:36.908]  Where is this all going to end with Donald Trump?
[03:18:36.908 --> 03:18:38.110]  And people are getting nervous.
[03:18:38.110 --> 03:18:43.034]  Bloomberg's getting nervous, and some of the other real estate people up in New York are getting nervous.
[03:18:43.034 --> 03:18:45.697]  And I would say that Trump knows a lot more.
[03:18:45.697 --> 03:18:49.460]  He hasn't talked about 9-11, but he may be saving it.
[03:18:49.460 --> 03:18:51.902]  Maybe he's going to put it in his inaugural address.
[03:18:52.863 --> 03:18:56.385]  Wouldn't that make a lot of people upset?
[03:18:56.385 --> 03:19:06.969]  I remember when Joe Biggs went up to New York City and he talked to people about Building 7 and a lot of people didn't realize that the replacement building that was built on the site of Building 7 was new.
[03:19:08.510 --> 03:19:08.650]  Yeah.
[03:19:08.650 --> 03:19:10.793]  They always thought it had been there this entire time.
[03:19:10.793 --> 03:19:11.674]  So yeah, you're right.
[03:19:11.674 --> 03:19:13.576]  Like Joe said, people don't know about the missing 28 pages.
[03:19:13.576 --> 03:19:21.126]  They don't even know about Building 7 and the fact that there's a new one where the last one was taken down by explosives.
[03:19:21.126 --> 03:19:23.209]  A lot of people don't realize.
[03:19:24.591 --> 03:19:26.532]  Three buildings, two planes.
[03:19:26.532 --> 03:19:29.652]  That's the common core math of 9-11.
[03:19:29.652 --> 03:19:35.734]  You know, we got three buildings that fell down, right in their footprint, only two planes hitting two of those buildings.
[03:19:35.734 --> 03:19:49.518]  But when we come back, we're going to take a look at what we found out as we traveled to West Texas, as we went to the Cebola Creek Ranch, looking into the oddities around the inquest, as well as some other things with the airport next door.
[03:19:49.518 --> 03:19:50.098]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:58.613 --> 03:20:03.454]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[03:20:03.454 --> 03:20:04.555]  Are you ready?
[03:20:04.555 --> 03:20:07.315]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[03:20:07.315 --> 03:20:09.676]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?

[03:21:03.467 --> 03:21:06.569]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:21:06.569 --> 03:21:07.649]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[03:21:07.649 --> 03:21:08.650]  I've been working all day.
[03:21:08.650 --> 03:21:11.111]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:21:11.111 --> 03:21:12.512]  I get in here at 830.
[03:21:12.512 --> 03:21:14.733]  I was kind of run down, you know.
[03:21:14.733 --> 03:21:16.194]  I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[03:21:16.354 --> 03:21:18.235]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:21:18.235 --> 03:21:20.077]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:21:20.077 --> 03:21:21.117]  I popped two of them.
[03:21:21.117 --> 03:21:23.399]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:21:23.399 --> 03:21:25.340]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:21:25.340 --> 03:21:26.861]  It's got four and a half stars.

[03:21:38.089 --> 03:21:42.110]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:21:42.110 --> 03:21:48.273]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.

[03:24:05.891 --> 03:24:07.012]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:07.012 --> 03:24:10.116]  I'm David Knight, here with Wayne Madsen, Joe Biggs, and Kit Daniels.
[03:24:10.116 --> 03:24:18.626]  We've just returned from investigating the death of Antonin Scalia, trying to get some answers to some questions that really didn't make any sense.
[03:24:18.626 --> 03:24:20.728]  Of course, we all saw some odd things.
[03:24:20.728 --> 03:24:21.709]  That's why we went out there.
[03:24:22.310 --> 03:24:25.374]  We saw a story that was changing about the cause of death.
[03:24:25.374 --> 03:24:27.537]  We saw a phone-in inquest.
[03:24:27.537 --> 03:24:32.083]  And then we got out there and we found some other things that were perhaps even stranger.
[03:24:32.083 --> 03:24:38.893]  The fact that we had this Hearst tour of Texas that they took the body on when there was an airfield.
[03:24:39.313 --> 03:24:40.994]  Right across from the ranch.
[03:24:40.994 --> 03:24:42.655]  That raised some additional questions.
[03:24:42.655 --> 03:24:46.976]  And of course we have a story up on InfoWars.com from Wade Madsen who is here with me.
[03:24:46.976 --> 03:24:51.518]  The media ignores why Scalia was on a free trip to this swanky resort.
[03:24:51.518 --> 03:24:53.039]  We're going to talk about that as well.
[03:24:53.039 --> 03:24:59.462]  And then we're going to talk about the feeling that we all got in terms of the fact that we were staying at the Shining Hotel.
[03:24:59.462 --> 03:25:03.764]  There was some really unusual aspects of staying at that hotel.
[03:25:03.764 --> 03:25:04.524]  I think we were all
[03:25:05.084 --> 03:25:05.925]  Very happy to leave.
[03:25:05.925 --> 03:25:12.513]  It's a beautiful, swanky hotel, but there were some issues that we want to talk about, and we'll show you some footage of that as well.
[03:25:12.513 --> 03:25:15.957]  Before we get to that, I want to let you know about the sales that we have.
[03:25:15.957 --> 03:25:25.708]  I've been talking about the 10% discount on AutoShip for a long time, and I did not realize that it extends beyond the initial sign-up period.
[03:25:25.908 --> 03:25:28.629]  I just clarified that with Alex when I was talking to him.
[03:25:28.629 --> 03:25:32.730]  He said, you mean you get 10% each month when you're on the auto ship?
[03:25:32.730 --> 03:25:33.770]  And he says, yeah, that's part of it.
[03:25:33.770 --> 03:25:35.931]  So I thought it was just an incentive to sign up.
[03:25:35.931 --> 03:25:38.691]  That's the way the information was put out there for me.
[03:25:38.691 --> 03:25:44.413]  So if you sign up for anything at Infowarsstore.com, at Infowarslife.com,
[03:25:45.293 --> 03:25:45.733]  You can't.
[03:26:06.843 --> 03:26:07.764]  Back in stock.
[03:26:07.764 --> 03:26:10.405]  That's also available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:26:10.405 --> 03:26:24.134]  If you want to make sure that you're going to get these products on a regular basis, so that you don't have a gap, that you're taking it on a continuing basis, then make sure that you sign up for AutoShip, for things like Supermail Vitality, for things like Silver Bullet.
[03:26:24.134 --> 03:26:29.017]  That way you'll get it each month and you will get it at 10% off.
[03:26:29.017 --> 03:26:32.660]  Let's talk a little bit about, let's talk about the hotel a little bit.
[03:26:32.660 --> 03:26:33.780]  Everybody can chime in.
[03:26:35.653 --> 03:26:37.374]  Some information with the hotel.
[03:26:37.374 --> 03:26:40.296]  I don't know.
[03:26:40.296 --> 03:26:42.398]  We all had this same statement.
[03:26:42.398 --> 03:26:43.458]  I had texted my wife.
[03:26:43.458 --> 03:26:47.161]  I said, you know, it's very isolated, very quiet.
[03:26:47.161 --> 03:26:48.662]  There's just a few people here.
[03:26:48.662 --> 03:26:53.845]  They're very suspicious of us, so they're kind of watching everything we do, peeking around the corners, looking.
[03:26:53.845 --> 03:26:58.708]  I said, I feel like I'm at the Shining Hotel, even though it's not that cold here.
[03:26:58.708 --> 03:27:02.871]  And everybody as they came in had that same statement.
[03:27:04.028 --> 03:27:08.394]  Yeah, I mean, thank God there wasn't a raging blizzard while we were there.
[03:27:08.394 --> 03:27:10.777]  I would have really gotten concerned.
[03:27:10.777 --> 03:27:19.848]  But obviously the people who work for Mr. Poindexter, John B. Poindexter, who's the owner, it was built in 1993.
[03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:23.752]  And it's very interesting.
[03:27:23.752 --> 03:27:25.233]  We talked about the airfield.
[03:27:25.233 --> 03:27:39.203]  The airfield, which is the Cibola Creek Ranch Airport, is owned by a company called Southwestern Holdings Incorporated out of Houston.
[03:27:39.203 --> 03:27:39.884]  Who's the owner?
[03:27:39.884 --> 03:27:42.145]  Mr. Poindexter.
[03:27:42.145 --> 03:27:46.449]  So there's an airport right across from the ranch, and it's owned by the owner of the ranch?
[03:27:46.449 --> 03:27:47.529]  The owner of the ranch.
[03:27:47.529 --> 03:27:50.832]  It's also serviced by a charter airline company.
[03:27:51.599 --> 03:27:53.616]  Uh, called Cibola Air.
[03:27:54.497 --> 03:27:55.878]  Who's the owner?
[03:27:55.878 --> 03:27:57.099]  Mr. Poindexter.
[03:27:57.099 --> 03:27:57.399]  Yeah.
[03:27:57.399 --> 03:28:01.682]  So this is like, he's got the whole thing, he's got the whole thing wrapped up.
[03:28:01.682 --> 03:28:08.186]  And of course, the issues that you raise in here, and it's also been raised by a couple of mainstream media outlets.
[03:28:08.186 --> 03:28:09.446]  Why were all these people there?
[03:28:09.446 --> 03:28:10.507]  Who are these people?
[03:28:10.507 --> 03:28:12.128]  Was this a free gift to Scalia?
[03:28:12.128 --> 03:28:23.475]  Because one of Poindexter's companies, he's got many companies, one of his companies had been before the Supreme Court and there was a favorable decision on that Supreme Court and Scalia sided with that.
[03:28:23.575 --> 03:28:27.776]  Yeah, well, basically the court decided not to hear the case.
[03:28:27.776 --> 03:28:35.278]  It was brought, it was an age discrimination case brought by an employee and they just said, you know, we're not going to hear it.
[03:28:35.278 --> 03:28:36.278]  Which allowed it to stand.
[03:28:36.278 --> 03:28:43.480]  Which allowed the lower court decision against the plaintiff, against the plaintiff to stand.
[03:28:45.800 --> 03:28:54.467]  Scalia, if you look at his record, he's one of the top two frequent flyers on boondoggles, where somebody picks up the tab.
[03:28:54.467 --> 03:28:57.689]  We know he'd been in Asia recently on a speaking tour.
[03:28:57.689 --> 03:29:05.395]  He'd been in three weeks before he was in Dallas, where the Marshal Service and the Secret Service arranged for him to get a haircut.
[03:29:05.395 --> 03:29:06.235]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:29:06.235 --> 03:29:07.416]  And they can't be bothered.
[03:29:07.416 --> 03:29:13.801]  We're told after the fact, oh, you know, the guy who went with him on that trip to Asia,
[03:29:14.201 --> 03:29:39.965]  was talking about how strong and vital and energetic he was he said that the day after then two days later he goes yeah he just essentially been given a death sentence by his uh... doctor who's a rear admiral politician in washington and yet this doctor allowed him to travel to this remote area where you have to sign a release saying that uh... you understand there's no hospital care here he stood down didn't have a physician traveling with him did not have any security with him and yet he had
[03:29:40.445 --> 03:29:44.409]  Secret Service arranging for his haircuts three weeks earlier in Dallas.
[03:29:44.409 --> 03:29:44.989]  Stay with us.
[03:29:44.989 --> 03:29:45.790]  We're gonna be right back.
[03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:47.792]  Wayne Madsen, Joe Biggs, Kit Daniels.
[03:29:47.792 --> 03:29:49.193]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.193 --> 03:29:51.715]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.715 --> 03:29:54.398]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.704 --> 03:30:03.448]  North Korea is planning a terrorist attack on South Korea.
[03:30:03.448 --> 03:30:12.315]  This according to the National Intelligence Service that says North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, gave the order to begin preparations.
[03:30:12.315 --> 03:30:20.682]  The NIS warning covered a large number of possible targets, including subways, shopping malls, and even a nuclear power plant.
[03:30:21.042 --> 03:30:26.145]  All key lines of communication between North and South Korea have been cut off.
[03:30:26.145 --> 03:30:38.593]  I've long predicted in my world affairs briefs that the North Korean attack on South Korea will be a trigger event for World War III, and you'll probably have a nuclear EMP and nuclear strike on America within a week after that's started.
[03:30:38.593 --> 03:30:47.519]  Now, as political scientist and author of Strategic Relocation, Joel Skousen, who says that a fight between North and South Korea might be a trigger event,
[03:30:47.819 --> 03:30:49.260]  To World War III.
[03:30:49.260 --> 03:30:50.240]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[03:30:50.240 --> 03:30:53.561]  forces in the region are making their presence known.

[03:32:13.927 --> 03:32:15.348]  I feel sexier.

[03:33:01.678 --> 03:33:03.519]  We are on the march.
[03:33:03.519 --> 03:33:06.680]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:33:06.680 --> 03:33:11.342]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:11.342 --> 03:33:15.643]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.643 --> 03:33:19.885]  I'm David Knight and joining me now is Wayne Madsen, Joe Biggs, Kit Daniels.
[03:33:19.885 --> 03:33:22.766]  We have all been out along with Josh Owens, our cameraman.
[03:33:22.766 --> 03:33:29.769]  We've all been investigating the circumstances of Justice Scalia's death because there were a lot of unusual things that were told.
[03:33:30.429 --> 03:33:34.170]  And we're pretty skeptical when we get answers from the government.
[03:33:34.170 --> 03:33:37.350]  We don't just repeat the press releases like the mainstream media does.
[03:33:37.350 --> 03:33:46.752]  You know, if you are skeptical, if you question what is being told to you, especially if they change the story as the days go along, then you're called a conspiracy theorist.
[03:33:46.752 --> 03:33:51.853]  We didn't offer any conspiracy theories about how or why Justice Scalia died.
[03:33:51.853 --> 03:33:55.994]  We simply said we would like to see you follow procedure and do an investigation.
[03:33:56.594 --> 03:33:58.075]  So, we went to the area.
[03:33:58.075 --> 03:34:00.537]  We tried to talk to some of the people involved.
[03:34:00.537 --> 03:34:02.919]  We did talk to many people in the area.
[03:34:02.919 --> 03:34:04.841]  We had some productive interviews.
[03:34:04.841 --> 03:34:16.850]  One of the things, besides the questions raised by the circumstances of his death, the lack of an autopsy, what they did with the body afterwards, driving it all over Texas instead of flying it back to Washington.
[03:34:17.811 --> 03:34:22.574]  In addition to that, of course, there's the issue of the hotel and why there were 36 guests there.
[03:34:22.574 --> 03:34:26.497]  Of course, while we were there, the entire hotel was empty.
[03:34:26.497 --> 03:34:31.921]  And as I said earlier, I think that's one of the reasons that it kind of felt like The Shining.
[03:34:31.921 --> 03:34:34.363]  We were the only people in that hotel.
[03:34:34.363 --> 03:34:37.125]  Joe and Kit, did you get that feeling as well?
[03:34:37.665 --> 03:34:38.205]  Yeah, of course.
[03:34:38.205 --> 03:34:52.997]  I mean, as soon as we walked in to the ranch, you know, you're already signing this waiver, you know, and then the lady hands me a piece of cardboard with just the name of the room, and Colonial North, I think was what it was, and I go, okay, where's the key?
[03:34:52.997 --> 03:34:54.939]  And she goes, we don't use keys.
[03:34:55.519 --> 03:34:56.681]  That's a really good point.
[03:34:56.681 --> 03:34:58.002]  It's really weird.
[03:34:58.002 --> 03:35:02.868]  I've never been to a hotel where you lock the door from the inside, but you can't lock it from the outside.
[03:35:02.868 --> 03:35:09.715]  So you go out quail hunting or ATV riding whatnot, but you leave your possessions in your room, but you can't lock them up.
[03:35:09.715 --> 03:35:14.321]  Yeah, and if you are in there asleep and your door's locked, who's the only person that can get in?
[03:35:14.741 --> 03:35:15.161]  Exactly.
[03:35:15.161 --> 03:35:16.743]  Someone who works there.
[03:35:16.743 --> 03:35:22.048]  And of course, there's also no telephone in case you need to call because you have health issues, like we're told now.
[03:35:22.048 --> 03:35:35.541]  I mean, I remember when we sat down that first night for dinner, you know, I was actually getting ready to take a picture of all of us at dinner, and it was on that selfie mode, and when I had the camera turned around, I could see what was behind me, and I turned around and there were all these, like, demonic, devil-looking masks.
[03:35:36.161 --> 03:35:40.264]  All up on the top part of the wall, lining that whole dinner area.
[03:35:40.264 --> 03:35:41.664]  It was super creepy.
[03:35:41.664 --> 03:35:45.367]  It reminded me of that movie Eyes Wide Shut.
[03:35:45.367 --> 03:35:47.088]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:35:47.088 --> 03:35:50.090]  We've got some pictures of those masks that are there.
[03:35:50.090 --> 03:35:53.952]  It's really creepy that Scalia's last meal was perhaps under all those masks.
[03:35:54.272 --> 03:35:54.372]  Yeah.
[03:35:54.372 --> 03:35:56.473]  I'm a very devout Catholic also.
[03:35:56.473 --> 03:36:06.820]  I mean, another strange thing about this resort, ranch, whatever you want to call it, is in the area where David and Kit stayed, where you guys were, these beds on the outside.
[03:36:06.820 --> 03:36:07.601]  Yeah, exactly, on the patio.
[03:36:07.601 --> 03:36:13.885]  That line the whole area, you know, and having these private events that are men during Valentine's weekend.
[03:36:14.505 --> 03:36:16.726]  You know, it's really an odd thing.
[03:36:16.726 --> 03:36:23.549]  Yeah, to put it in perspective, it's kind of like you had like a hallway slash patio outside all the rooms.
[03:36:23.549 --> 03:36:26.950]  But the wing we were staying at was in this patio were like beds.
[03:36:26.950 --> 03:36:28.091]  There weren't even day beds.
[03:36:28.091 --> 03:36:30.432]  They were actual beds that were set up.
[03:36:30.432 --> 03:36:34.954]  You know, you had beds and the bookshelves and then reclining chairs, sofas, and other things.
[03:36:34.954 --> 03:36:35.974]  Exactly.
[03:36:35.974 --> 03:36:42.017]  So it was really odd that you had not only these beds, but even in the rooms, all the beds were like twin beds.
[03:36:42.597 --> 03:36:45.701]  It's like, this is not a place you, if you're married, you would take your wife to.
[03:36:45.701 --> 03:36:46.822]  Yeah.
[03:36:46.822 --> 03:36:47.883]  Yeah, it's very unusual.
[03:36:47.883 --> 03:36:56.673]  And of course, the fact that they had virtually no guests the entire time we were there, that I think raised questions to me, which you raised in your article, Wayne.
[03:36:57.734 --> 03:36:59.535]  What is the purpose of this hotel?
[03:36:59.535 --> 03:37:07.598]  I mean, is this simply a prestigious tax write-off that he can bring in political friends and, you know, have private parties with them?
[03:37:07.598 --> 03:37:19.003]  Because he's saying he does this frequently, he does this multiple times a year, bring in several dozen guests, and yet we see absolutely no paying guests while we're there, except for we're the only people in the entire hotel.
[03:37:19.003 --> 03:37:20.824]  That's why, one of the reasons why it felt so creepy.
[03:37:21.204 --> 03:37:34.474]  And he said that he allows these people to stay for free, yet we also, Poindexter, the owner, said that he paid for everything but the flight in.
[03:37:34.474 --> 03:37:42.200]  Well, we know that Scully arrived on a private jet at the airport, at the Ranch Airport, around noon on that Friday.
[03:37:42.200 --> 03:37:43.861]  He was found dead Saturday morning.
[03:37:44.702 --> 03:37:49.686]  And now we're told that of course he didn't pay, Scalia didn't pay for that trip.
[03:37:49.686 --> 03:37:51.388]  So what is this all about?
[03:37:51.388 --> 03:38:03.899]  You know, we know politicians are owned and operated by special interests, but the problem with judges, especially Supreme Court justices, is that the decisions they make, which establish case law
[03:38:04.620 --> 03:38:16.070]  Far outlives them and the presidents who nominated them, and those laws affect every man, woman, and child in this country for decades, if not centuries afterwards.
[03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:24.537]  So the fact is that he's like involved in accepting gratuities from a guy who had a case before the court.
[03:38:25.217 --> 03:38:28.558]  I think raises more troubling issues than his suspicious death.
[03:38:28.558 --> 03:38:33.939]  A man of that stature, when you find someone like that dead, that's already, there's already a motive there.
[03:38:33.939 --> 03:38:35.680]  There's already a motive there.
[03:38:35.680 --> 03:38:41.442]  It's really funny how they can fly him into this private airport, but they can't fly his body out of the private airport.
[03:38:41.442 --> 03:38:45.923]  They gotta take his body to Alpine, I think to get him bombed, or was it New Me... Alpasa.
[03:38:45.923 --> 03:38:46.843]  Yeah, Alpasa.
[03:38:46.843 --> 03:38:50.444]  Let's talk about the securitist route that they took, because that was very interesting.
[03:38:50.444 --> 03:38:53.585]  Take a document shot of the pictures.
[03:38:54.125 --> 03:38:55.365]  That Wayne has here.
[03:38:55.365 --> 03:38:57.486]  These are postcards that he got at the hotel.
[03:38:57.486 --> 03:39:02.207]  And you can see this first one right here that has a Chinook helicopter.
[03:39:02.207 --> 03:39:04.428]  That is flying right over the man-made lake there.
[03:39:04.428 --> 03:39:11.449]  And the room that Scalia was in was right adjacent to where that helicopter is.
[03:39:11.449 --> 03:39:15.430]  But then the other picture shows the airport that is right across from there.
[03:39:15.430 --> 03:39:22.852]  And of course Gulfstream planes can land in that airport that is owned by the same person who owns the hotel.
[03:39:23.192 --> 03:39:24.453]  That's right.
[03:39:24.453 --> 03:39:27.354]  Of course Gulfstream Airplanes that look somewhat like this.
[03:39:27.354 --> 03:39:28.454]  I'll put that there.
[03:39:28.454 --> 03:39:33.636]  And then the interesting thing is the route that they took and the amount of time that's involved here.
[03:39:33.636 --> 03:39:39.139]  From the Cibola Creek Ranch to Marfa where the Judge Cinderella Guevara was, okay?
[03:39:39.901 --> 03:39:42.982]  is only 43 minutes, but of course it was too far for her to drive.
[03:39:42.982 --> 03:39:46.024]  That's why she did the phone in inquest.
[03:39:46.024 --> 03:39:47.725]  She could not drive 43 minutes.
[03:39:47.725 --> 03:39:52.707]  Now, understand that in this area of Texas, 43 minutes is next door.
[03:39:52.707 --> 03:39:53.467]  Okay?
[03:39:53.467 --> 03:39:54.808]  Everything is hours apart.
[03:39:54.808 --> 03:39:57.109]  But David, there was a lot of business going on in Marfa.
[03:39:57.109 --> 03:39:58.129]  I mean, she's swamped.
[03:39:58.129 --> 03:40:00.210]  She was swamped with media requests.
[03:40:00.210 --> 03:40:01.531]  She's swamped with a lot of things.
[03:40:01.531 --> 03:40:03.211]  You know, Marfa's a booming town.
[03:40:03.211 --> 03:40:04.632]  They got those lights out at night time.
[03:40:04.632 --> 03:40:06.313]  I mean, she's busy.
[03:40:07.814 --> 03:40:12.719]  Let's take a look at the route that the Hearst did after the death.
[03:40:12.719 --> 03:40:14.921]  There's a lot of time involved there.
[03:40:14.921 --> 03:40:22.868]  They took the body from the Cebolla Creek Ranch and they went, let's put this document here, you can see they go from the ranch here
[03:40:23.388 --> 03:40:25.811]  They go up to Marfa, okay?
[03:40:25.811 --> 03:40:26.511]  43 minutes.
[03:40:26.511 --> 03:40:30.155]  But then there's a funeral home that's in Marfa, but they don't use that funeral home.
[03:40:30.155 --> 03:40:32.997]  Instead, they go to Alpine, over here, okay?
[03:40:32.997 --> 03:40:37.662]  Now, that whole trip from the ranch to Alpine, that is 1 hour and 12 minutes.
[03:40:39.924 --> 03:40:51.971]  Then, later, they go, and I'll show you this picture here, they go back in the opposite direction, they backtrack and go further west, they go from Alpine then to El Paso, and that is a 3 hour 15 minute ride.
[03:40:51.971 --> 03:41:00.737]  Okay, so total time they've driven this body around, passing up two funeral homes in two different towns with funeral homes in them, is 4 hours and 30 minutes.
[03:41:00.737 --> 03:41:04.359]  Now, if they were to use a Gulf Stream, which is across the street, okay,
[03:41:05.400 --> 03:41:09.303]  The average cruising speed of Gulf Stream is 560 miles an hour.
[03:41:09.303 --> 03:41:15.287]  Three hours and 20 minutes to go 1,900 miles, which is the distance to DC.
[03:41:15.287 --> 03:41:15.468]  Right.
[03:41:15.468 --> 03:41:25.756]  So instead of taking a 3 hour 20 minute flight to DC, okay, they take a 4 hour 30 minute hearse ride around Texas.
[03:41:25.756 --> 03:41:31.620]  And even if, even though we know that the wife didn't want, Mrs. Scalia requested no autopsy, there could have still been a
[03:41:33.107 --> 03:41:47.418]  An inquest done by his doctor at Bethesda Naval Hospital, or a certified medical examiner in his home county of Fairfax County, Virginia, but not this situation where a judge
[03:41:49.119 --> 03:41:53.843]  It makes a determination without the body being viewed by her over the telephone.
[03:41:53.843 --> 03:42:06.393]  Yeah, Wayne, I got a letter from a lawyer, a Texas attorney from Woodlands, and he said that, quote, Cinderella Guevara is a county judge and she made the decision that Justice Scalia died of natural causes.
[03:42:06.393 --> 03:42:09.796]  However, she did exceed her authority in making this declaration.
[03:42:11.739 --> 03:42:20.564]  So, yeah, I mean, and like what we talked to the former deputy under the sheriff out there in Presidio County, was that he could get an autopsy all the time.
[03:42:20.564 --> 03:42:30.369]  Not only that, but it was unprecedented for a county judge or a justice of the peace to not show up to see a dead body when the circumstances of the death are not known.
[03:42:30.629 --> 03:42:42.294]  Well last night even the New York Post came out with an article, it was yesterday sometime, saying they talked to one of the top pathologists up in New York and said that they believe it's extremely possible for Scalia to have been poisoned.
[03:42:42.294 --> 03:42:42.755]  Yeah.
[03:42:42.755 --> 03:42:47.677]  They said that that is definitely a possibility and the fact that this body's taken El Paso
[03:42:48.337 --> 03:42:50.479]  Everything's drained out, thrown in the sewage.
[03:42:50.479 --> 03:42:51.980]  There's no way of ever knowing now.
[03:42:51.980 --> 03:42:57.865]  We'll be asking this question for years on, and it'll be a top story for years, people talking about it.
[03:42:57.865 --> 03:43:01.348]  It's ridiculous what they've did to this man, because this is a man who fought for the truth.
[03:43:01.348 --> 03:43:05.411]  This is a man who followed the law, and no one had his back.
[03:43:05.411 --> 03:43:08.634]  No one followed the law to make sure that he was taken care of after he left.
[03:43:08.934 --> 03:43:18.081]  And that's why we went out there, because here you have someone who is the major obstacle in the way of Obama's agendas, major obstacle in the way of globalist agendas.
[03:43:18.081 --> 03:43:26.067]  He's the person who really holds the balance of power in the Supreme Court in the sense that he was the intellectual center of the conservatives.
[03:43:28.029 --> 03:43:36.177]  And that, in and of itself, says that we should have an investigation to rule out conspiracies, to rule out foul play.
[03:43:36.177 --> 03:43:38.239]  And we went out there to ask these questions.
[03:43:38.239 --> 03:43:40.241]  The judge would not talk to us.
[03:43:40.241 --> 03:43:42.083]  We've shown you the videos of that.
[03:43:42.083 --> 03:43:47.388]  And as we were doing the report, we also had someone come up to us and say, this is not the first time this has happened.
[03:43:47.388 --> 03:43:48.890]  We've had a mysterious death back in 2013.
[03:43:50.611 --> 03:43:56.795]  And it looked to many of us, the immediate family, as well as to the railroad investigators.
[03:43:56.795 --> 03:43:59.776]  This is a body that was run over, laying on the tracks.
[03:43:59.776 --> 03:44:06.860]  And they said, it looks like this lady, who had only been married for six months, it looks like she was placed there as she was unconscious.
[03:44:06.860 --> 03:44:08.641]  That was what the railroad investigator said.
[03:44:08.641 --> 03:44:12.063]  However, the same judge, the same sheriff, ruled it a suicide.
[03:44:13.311 --> 03:44:16.033]  On the basis that she had resigned her job recently.
[03:44:16.033 --> 03:44:17.935]  And she had just recently been married as well.
[03:44:17.935 --> 03:44:19.616]  So she had had a change in life circumstances.
[03:44:19.616 --> 03:44:21.237]  So the family was very upset about that.
[03:44:21.237 --> 03:44:23.619]  Many people in the town were upset about that.
[03:44:23.619 --> 03:44:33.046]  And so we looked to see, since the sheriff wouldn't talk to us, since the judge would not talk to us, we said, well, let's ask a deputy about this because it turns out that there's an election coming up.
[03:44:33.046 --> 03:44:36.149]  A former deputy is running against this sheriff.
[03:44:36.149 --> 03:44:39.551]  And he also had a lawsuit at one point in time alleging that
[03:44:40.772 --> 03:44:51.341]  The sheriff had fired him for unjust cause, saying that there was a gun that the sheriff was demanding be turned back to a friend of his, and there was a restraining order against this friend.
[03:44:51.341 --> 03:44:59.648]  Ultimately, the sheriff set that aside and returned the gun to the son of the individual who himself had a felony.
[03:44:59.648 --> 03:45:08.175]  And so, he said that there's been a lot of situations like this where the investigations are handled differently depending on who it is.
[03:45:08.795 --> 03:45:11.537]  As well as the way the citizens are treated there as well.
[03:45:11.537 --> 03:45:20.485]  David, the very key thing that this deputy said was the fact that he worked that case in 2013 with the lady that was found dead in the railroad.
[03:45:20.485 --> 03:45:26.150]  And the deputy said he had the most experience of all of them, including the sheriff, on homicide investigations.
[03:45:26.150 --> 03:45:27.631]  Yeah, he said he'd been trained by Texas Rangers.
[03:45:27.631 --> 03:45:28.972]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:45:28.972 --> 03:45:35.517]  The sheriff called him in late that night to deal with the body, but he had him only doing traffic control in Marfa, Texas, a town of 2,000 people.
[03:45:36.198 --> 03:45:41.440]  Yeah, it's really weird that this guy did have the most training, and then the same thing happened with Scalia.
[03:45:41.440 --> 03:45:45.302]  You know, this sheriff with no training whatsoever, a U.S.
[03:45:45.302 --> 03:45:53.846]  Marshal that has no training in this, you have a judge that can't even take a 43-minute drive out there to do her job because a Supreme Court justice was found dead.
[03:45:53.846 --> 03:45:54.826]  You know, you have this
[03:45:56.701 --> 03:45:57.861]  This path.
[03:45:57.861 --> 03:46:00.902]  And this is something that happened over a period of at least 14 hours.
[03:46:00.902 --> 03:46:02.963]  We talked about the security route that they took with the body.
[03:46:02.963 --> 03:46:05.683]  Yeah, so in 14 hours someone knew who they were dealing with by that time.
[03:46:05.683 --> 03:46:06.644]  Yeah.
[03:46:06.644 --> 03:46:14.346]  Before we run out of time, I want to play some excerpts from an interview that Joe Biggs had with Michael Savage, who was also concerned about the way this was handled.
[03:46:14.346 --> 03:46:15.106]  Let's play that interview.
[03:46:15.965 --> 03:46:18.487]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[03:46:18.487 --> 03:46:31.699]  Now, on February 16, 2016, I had the opportunity to go on The Savage Nation and speak with Dr. Michael Savage about our investigation into the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
[03:46:31.699 --> 03:46:34.221]  Here are a few clips from that interview.
[03:46:34.221 --> 03:46:37.824]  Joining us right now is a reporter for InfoWars.com, Joe Biggs.
[03:46:37.824 --> 03:46:39.065]  Joe, you're down in Texas.
[03:46:39.065 --> 03:46:39.586]  Where are you?
[03:46:39.586 --> 03:46:41.527]  Near the judges' chambers?
[03:46:42.792 --> 03:46:49.217]  We are in Marfa, Texas, just outside of County Judge Cinderella Guerrero's office.
[03:46:49.217 --> 03:46:52.719]  Cinderella couldn't pronounce the words myocardial infarction.
[03:46:52.719 --> 03:46:56.702]  How could she declare he died of a myocardial infarction and then change her mind?
[03:46:57.557 --> 03:47:04.599]  Well, here's the thing you have to understand, Dr. Savage, is the first two justices of the peace that were called were out of town that day.
[03:47:04.599 --> 03:47:06.939]  They were about 120 miles away at some event.
[03:47:06.939 --> 03:47:13.981]  You mean to tell me when that name came over the wire, they didn't drop what they were doing and take the time to drive a few hours to come out here?
[03:47:13.981 --> 03:47:18.542]  Now, before that, John Koindexer, the guy who owns the ranch, called the feds.
[03:47:18.542 --> 03:47:19.283]  The feds flew in.
[03:47:19.283 --> 03:47:22.023]  You mean to tell me they couldn't have picked one of these people up?
[03:47:22.023 --> 03:47:24.484]  Instead, it was passed on to a third person
[03:47:25.519 --> 03:47:26.720]  Judge Cinderella.
[03:47:26.720 --> 03:47:30.924]  Now in the past, in 2016, she has made some botched calls before.
[03:47:30.924 --> 03:47:31.944]  Oh really?
[03:47:31.944 --> 03:47:35.147]  What did Cinderella do in the past that was questionable?
[03:47:35.147 --> 03:47:43.554]  In 2013, there was an incident in Big Bend where an unconscious woman was laying on the train tracks, a train ran over her and sliced her into pieces.
[03:47:44.174 --> 03:47:50.117]  Now, the railroad company came out, did their own internal investigation, said that it should be investigated.
[03:47:50.117 --> 03:47:52.918]  The family came out and said they wanted an investigation.
[03:47:52.918 --> 03:47:58.280]  They called Cinderella, and she goes, oh, nope, suicide, and ended it right there.
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:47:59.960]  Did not go in, did not do an investigation.
[03:47:59.960 --> 03:48:05.203]  So, so, so Cinderella is, is, uh, who is she?
[03:48:05.203 --> 03:48:09.004]  She's a low, she's a low-grade local judge?
[03:48:09.004 --> 03:48:11.165]  Pretty much, she's a county judge here in Marfa.
[03:48:12.516 --> 03:48:13.834]  Martha, Texas, wow!
[03:48:14.372 --> 03:48:14.652]  I know.
[03:48:14.652 --> 03:48:16.413]  I mean, there's a lot of things surrounding this.
[03:48:16.413 --> 03:48:25.519]  I mean, like you said before, I've heard other people say that this was a Republican president, a ranch owned by a Republican donor, and it was a liberal judge who died out there.
[03:48:25.519 --> 03:48:29.122]  The entire left would be screaming and crying, asking for an investigation.
[03:48:29.122 --> 03:48:33.265]  As soon as this man's name came down over the wire, they should have been locked down.
[03:48:33.265 --> 03:48:34.946]  They should have called for an investigation.
[03:48:34.946 --> 03:48:38.148]  They should have done an autopsy, toxicology, and all of that.
[03:48:38.148 --> 03:48:40.750]  Instead, they take the body and drive it to El Paso.
[03:48:40.750 --> 03:48:44.012]  Now, we have an investigator in El Paso right now who just spoke to the mortician.
[03:48:44.432 --> 03:48:45.653]  Who did the embalming.
[03:48:45.653 --> 03:48:49.636]  They just drained his fluids and threw them into the El Paso sewage.
[03:48:49.636 --> 03:48:51.358]  Oh my God, you're kidding me.
[03:48:51.358 --> 03:48:52.459]  They did that already?
[03:48:52.459 --> 03:48:54.781]  Yes, that has already been done.
[03:48:54.781 --> 03:48:56.802]  Oh my God.
[03:48:56.802 --> 03:49:00.245]  Oh, so they're covering it up already.
[03:49:00.245 --> 03:49:01.466]  This is terrifying.
[03:49:01.466 --> 03:49:04.669]  You would think this would happen in Paraguay.
[03:49:04.669 --> 03:49:06.810]  Or in Uruguay in the 1970s.
[03:49:06.810 --> 03:49:10.994]  But it's happening here now under, under our dear leader.
[03:49:12.573 --> 03:49:17.274]  Joe, has a single politician, one politician, called for an investigation?
[03:49:18.232 --> 03:49:22.195]  Not that I'm aware of, but all I hear are homicide investigators.
[03:49:22.195 --> 03:49:25.737]  There was one of the main homicide investigators for D.C.
[03:49:25.737 --> 03:49:29.780]  People, police all over the country have said that this should be investigated.
[03:49:29.780 --> 03:49:33.302]  There's an outcry by people who are specialized in this.
[03:49:33.302 --> 03:49:35.964]  Now you have this, you know, Texas, or this U.S.
[03:49:35.964 --> 03:49:37.065]  Marshal that came out.
[03:49:37.065 --> 03:49:43.369]  He's not even trained in homicide, and yet he's the one calling and going, oh, you know, this is just natural causes, let's pass it on.
[03:49:43.369 --> 03:49:44.870]  Well, right, he was, that U.S.
[03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:46.791]  Marshal was appointed by Obama.
[03:49:46.791 --> 03:49:47.652]  Have you interviewed him?
[03:49:48.052 --> 03:49:48.513]  No, not yet.
[03:49:48.513 --> 03:49:49.734]  We just got into Martha.
[03:49:49.734 --> 03:49:50.876]  We're going to the ranch next.
[03:49:50.876 --> 03:49:52.158]  We're going to be here for the next few days.
[03:49:52.158 --> 03:49:56.563]  We've got a long list of people that we will be... I suggest that you bring your food with you.
[03:49:56.563 --> 03:50:01.390]  I would suggest you don't accept their hospitality for any meals.
[03:50:01.390 --> 03:50:02.992]  Oh yeah, I'm definitely throwing the pillows off the bed.
[03:50:04.841 --> 03:50:07.923]  By the way, do you know anyone who sleeps with a pillow over their head?
[03:50:07.923 --> 03:50:08.984]  I haven't met one yet.
[03:50:08.984 --> 03:50:09.785]  I've never heard of it.
[03:50:09.785 --> 03:50:13.107]  I've actually stopped and talked to a few people, and they thought that that was normal.
[03:50:13.107 --> 03:50:15.349]  And everyone's going, uh, no, that's pretty normal.
[03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:24.216]  Well, maybe it's normal, but you see, maybe it's not normal in that Texas county, but it could be normal amongst Italian-Americans of 79 years of age.
[03:50:24.216 --> 03:50:29.800]  We have to interview all 79-year-old male Italian-Americans and see what percentage
[03:50:30.240 --> 03:50:32.762]  A percentage of them sleep with pillows over their head.
[03:50:32.762 --> 03:50:38.528]  Because I'm sure the Washington Post will report... Okay, so we don't have time to play the rest of that interview, but you can see that up on Alex Jones' YouTube channel again.
[03:50:38.528 --> 03:50:42.671]  That was Michael Savage talking to Joe Biggs as we were reporting the situation there.
[03:50:42.671 --> 03:50:53.681]  We're going to be back with Wayne Madsen, Kit Daniels, and we're going to talk about Scalia's son saying that conspiracy theories about his father's death are hurtful.
[03:50:53.681 --> 03:50:54.302]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:59.214 --> 03:51:01.216]  Are you sneezing, coughing, and aching?
[03:51:01.216 --> 03:51:05.161]  Do you have a sore throat, a fever, or the sniffles?

[03:51:59.887 --> 03:52:03.670]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:52:03.670 --> 03:52:11.395]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:52:11.395 --> 03:52:20.001]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:52:20.001 --> 03:52:24.444]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:52:24.444 --> 03:52:29.587]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:52:30.007 --> 03:52:34.249]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:52:34.249 --> 03:52:37.670]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.

[03:54:08.407 --> 03:54:09.748]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:09.748 --> 03:54:29.865]  I'm David Knight here with Wayne Madsen, Joe Biggs, Kit Daniels and we have just returned from Texas asking questions as many people are asking questions of what happened there and as you're looking at that b-roll there that was those were the kind of satanic mass that hovered over our dinner table every night as we ate alone in this massive hotel.
[03:54:30.606 --> 03:54:32.507]  And as I said, we're not the only ones who are asking questions.
[03:54:32.507 --> 03:54:35.049]  We have a retired homicide investigator.
[03:54:35.049 --> 03:54:42.775]  Mr. Ritchie says, you've got a justice of the peace pronouncing death while not on the scene without any medical training, opining that the justice died of a heart attack.
[03:54:42.775 --> 03:54:45.737]  What medical proof exists of a myocardial infarction?
[03:54:45.737 --> 03:54:46.998]  Why not a cerebral hemorrhage?
[03:54:47.498 --> 03:54:47.758]  Right?
[03:54:47.758 --> 03:54:55.944]  So there's all these different issues, and yet his family says that conspiracy theories about his father's death, his son says, are hurtful.
[03:54:55.944 --> 03:55:10.893]  I think what is hurtful is to set aside standard operating procedures, especially in the death of someone who is this prominent, and also who has a legacy of saying, we're going to follow the Constitution, we're going to follow the laws as written.
[03:55:10.893 --> 03:55:14.556]  It's a very good point you bring that article up, David, because I was looking at it myself just now.
[03:55:15.296 --> 03:55:26.949]  Yeah, the son is saying that, you know, culminators like Michael Savage and Alex Jones concern his father's death are a hurtful distraction to his legacy about the so-called conspiracy theories.
[03:55:26.949 --> 03:55:28.891]  So who said the pillow was on the head?
[03:55:28.891 --> 03:55:29.712]  John Poindexter.
[03:55:29.712 --> 03:55:30.913]  We didn't come up with that.
[03:55:30.913 --> 03:55:31.614]  Here's my point.
[03:55:31.934 --> 03:55:32.334]  Yeah.
[03:55:32.334 --> 03:55:33.395]  Who said it was a heart attack?
[03:55:33.395 --> 03:55:34.235]  We didn't say that either.
[03:55:34.235 --> 03:55:36.476]  That was a conspiracy theory by the judge.
[03:55:36.476 --> 03:55:40.718]  When you're a public official, you're held to a different standard than a private citizen.
[03:55:40.718 --> 03:55:46.300]  So yes, the public is going to demand an autopsy because this could very well be an issue of national security.
[03:55:46.300 --> 03:55:47.521]  A. B. Also, it said
[03:55:48.081 --> 03:55:52.706]  Laura Enneagram said the speculation was the most stupidest, ridiculous thing.
[03:55:52.706 --> 03:55:56.310]  But if we had an autopsy, there wouldn't be any speculation to begin with.
[03:55:56.310 --> 03:55:57.091]  Exactly.
[03:55:57.091 --> 03:56:00.595]  If you find a dead illegal alien in a field, what are you going to do?
[03:56:00.595 --> 03:56:02.497]  They automatically do an autopsy.
[03:56:02.497 --> 03:56:03.378]  Why can't we do this first?
[03:56:03.378 --> 03:56:07.363]  We can get autopsies on illegal aliens, but not a Supreme Court justice.
[03:56:08.684 --> 03:56:17.527]  They don't have a problem with a judge who is not there without any medical training speculating that it was a heart attack, and yet they have trouble when we talk about that.
[03:56:17.527 --> 03:56:20.068]  But I want to get Wayne Madsen's take on this.
[03:56:20.068 --> 03:56:22.069]  Wayne, what's your final take on this?
[03:56:22.069 --> 03:56:34.114]  Well, I would note what Cesar Melendez said, the man who was the former deputy sheriff down in Presidio County, who's running against the current incumbent who's been there for decades, Dominguez, who botched this entire thing up.
[03:56:35.755 --> 03:56:50.943]  Former Deputy Melendez said anytime they would discover a body, whether it was an unattended death in somebody's home or out in the field, it was a migrant, illegal migrant, they would treat it as a homicide until they ruled everything else out.
[03:56:51.523 --> 03:56:54.384]  And then they could determine whether it was an accident or death.
[03:56:54.384 --> 03:56:55.065]  And that's not a conspiracy.
[03:56:55.065 --> 03:56:56.785]  It's called a criminal investigation.
[03:56:56.785 --> 03:56:58.046]  It's proper protocol.
[03:56:58.046 --> 03:57:02.868]  He said all these procedures were violated in this case.
[03:57:02.868 --> 03:57:08.971]  And, you know, there's a couple things with the son of Scalia saying what he's saying.
[03:57:09.731 --> 03:57:26.820]  Either his father died an embarrassing death that the family didn't want the autopsy because it might reveal what was in his system as far as any sort of pharmaceuticals, alcohol perhaps, or the
[03:57:29.801 --> 03:57:38.306]  The other thing is, and this happens a lot in British intelligence, when they target somebody, they make it look like a suicide.
[03:57:38.306 --> 03:57:40.307]  But it's not just that.
[03:57:40.307 --> 03:57:42.748]  They murder the person, make it look like a suicide.
[03:57:42.748 --> 03:57:44.049]  Usually they're found hanging.
[03:57:44.049 --> 03:57:50.212]  Then they put women's underwear on a man and then spread a bunch of pornography around the floor.
[03:57:50.212 --> 03:57:55.215]  What happens is the family is so upset and so embarrassed, they don't want any kind of investigation.
[03:57:55.215 --> 03:57:56.936]  They'll go along with the official story.
[03:57:57.316 --> 03:57:58.797]  They did that with a spy in the bag.
[03:57:58.797 --> 03:58:00.337]  They did all that that you're talking about.
[03:58:00.337 --> 03:58:03.918]  They put him in the bag and people said, well, he committed suicide by putting himself in a bag.
[03:58:03.918 --> 03:58:05.319]  It's like, you've got to be crazy.
[03:58:05.319 --> 03:58:06.980]  You can't possibly do that.
[03:58:06.980 --> 03:58:08.300]  That happens all the time.
[03:58:08.300 --> 03:58:10.721]  This is what happens when you get an autopsy.
[03:58:10.721 --> 03:58:11.861]  A lot of questions about that.
[03:58:11.861 --> 03:58:15.663]  Well, thank you so much, Wayne Madsen, Kit Daniels, Joe Biggs.
[03:58:15.663 --> 03:58:17.083]  That's it for today's broadcast.
[03:58:17.083 --> 03:58:20.564]  Join us tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:20.564 --> 03:58:21.665]  Eastern with Leanne McAdoo.
