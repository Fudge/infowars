[00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:06.845]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:00:06.845 --> 00:00:14.392]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:20.618]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.281]  Wow!
[00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:51.043]  Where to start today?
[00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:54.225]  We know what's going on behind the scenes with Matt Lauer being removed.
[00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:56.886]  I've been talking about this for six months.
[00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:05.951]  I told you that when Charlie Rose was removed, get ready to see most of the other big anchors removed who have big giant
[00:01:07.557 --> 00:01:10.679]  Contracts, and they're not delivering globalism.
[00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:11.780]  They're not delivering ratings.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.381]  They're not delivering the New World Order.
[00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:23.548]  That's why the mainstream media has been fighting so hard since President Trump was elected a year ago to try to defeat him and defeat the American recovery.
[00:01:23.548 --> 00:01:30.573]  Because if ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, if they can't deliver
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:42.369]  At the New York Times, the Washington Post, owned by all the multinational globalist kingpins, the Carlos Slims, the slave factory Jeff Bezoses.
[00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.812]  If they can't deliver, then they're worthless!
[00:01:45.812 --> 00:01:47.894]  And they're going to have their contracts terminated.
[00:01:47.894 --> 00:01:53.398]  But you've got to have a clause to get out of these 5, 10, 15 million dollar a year contracts.
[00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:54.800]  And how do you do it?
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.422]  They know all about the sexual harassment.
[00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:59.830]  They know all about it.
[00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.511]  It's been proven.
[00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:02.072]  They know all about it with Conyers.
[00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:06.356]  They know all about it with all these different talk show hosts.
[00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:12.282]  But now because people are going public in this time of awakening, they're going to make lemonade out of lemons.
[00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:17.207]  And they're going to use it to purge all the dead wood.
[00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:23.093]  Now it looks like, well it doesn't look like, the New York police are reporting, the LA police are reporting, sex trafficking
[00:02:24.773 --> 00:02:30.318]  Sex trafficking of reported women that were in sex slavery.
[00:02:30.318 --> 00:02:41.807]  That's the next big shoe to drop for Mr. Weinstein and all his lawyers and all the private detectives and all the Mossad operatives.
[00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:44.490]  Oh, that's been in mainstream news.
[00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.796]  Running around engaging in all sorts of operations in this country using sex to control people.
[00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:52.637]  And I want to be clear.
[00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:59.110]  You've got a leftist arm in Israel, a right-wing arm, you've got Hasidic groups, you've got a lot of different people.
[00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.054]  And the same leftist groups trying to overthrow Trump are the same ones involved with Weinstein out of Israel.
[00:03:06.054 --> 00:03:12.078]  So again, it's a leftist issue whether you're in Russia or whether you're in the UK or whether you're in Israel.
[00:03:12.078 --> 00:03:16.900]  It's leftist groups that are really at the vanguard of using these tactics.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.963]  There are more Soros foundations and groups in Russia than there are in the US.
[00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:25.896]  I mean, Russia is barely under its own control right now.
[00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:29.997]  Just barely pulling the face sucker off.
[00:03:29.997 --> 00:03:34.078]  So, when I talk about the Mossad being involved in this, that's been in mainstream news.
[00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:37.939]  It's not an attack on Israel, because the media will spin it as that.
[00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.320]  That's all they do.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.501]  It's just showing you these are intelligence agencies.
[00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:44.941]  These are factions of intelligence agencies.
[00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:49.342]  And it's Trump with patriots in our intelligence agencies that are rolling this up.
[00:03:49.342 --> 00:03:50.503]  I don't just think that.
[00:03:51.423 --> 00:04:01.069]  I have sources in all the major intelligence groups, and in the SEAL teams, and in the Army Special Operations, and in all those major groups, okay?
[00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.290]  And there is a civil war in this country.
[00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.251]  We have the Secret Service contacts.
[00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:08.473]  We have the contacts in Google, Facebook, Amazon.
[00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:10.254]  Mid-level, low-level, high-level.
[00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:14.116]  I've got so much intel, and it's all incredibly accurate.
[00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:18.559]  I mean, when I say it's all incredibly accurate, people are risking their lives with this stuff.
[00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:20.100]  So the media tries to spin it all.
[00:04:21.038 --> 00:04:25.744]  There were scores of headlines in Newsweek and Time yesterday.
[00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:30.490]  Alex Jones calls Vegas massacre phony and says it doesn't exist.
[00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.652]  Never said that total lie.
[00:04:32.654 --> 00:04:34.435]  But that's how they counter it.
[00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:42.260]  When we get a source breaking down the Islamic Civil War going on, spilling over into Vegas, they want that shut down, so they put out this info.
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:52.407]  We're going to cover North Korea, what's behind the Matt Lauer thing, what's happening with Conyers, the EU president admitting the real plan for world government using migrant invasions.
[00:04:52.407 --> 00:04:56.310]  It is all coming up today, so strap yourselves in and spread the word.
[00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:01.848]  I'm so excited.
[00:05:01.848 --> 00:05:12.014]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:05:12.014 --> 00:05:17.518]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulus in it.
[00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:20.520]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:29.326]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:05:31.387 --> 00:05:50.980]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.682]  It is amazing!
[00:05:53.682 --> 00:05:58.645]  Red Pill, now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:06:11.252 --> 00:06:16.137]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:06:16.137 --> 00:06:18.239]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:33.975]  Our Republic is in the middle of a civil war.
[00:06:36.007 --> 00:06:44.523]  The globalist faction is foreign multinational cutthroat banks, allied with the Communist China, the EU, the Vatican, and other criminal organizations.
[00:06:44.523 --> 00:06:46.847]  The Vatican has been seized by the globalists.
[00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:48.290]  Even mainline Catholics will tell you that.
[00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:53.495]  And they use pedophile rings to penetrate it, compromise it, and get control of it.
[00:06:53.495 --> 00:06:56.596]  The same things happen in the US to a certain extent.
[00:06:56.596 --> 00:07:05.437]  And right now, Trump and patriots in our intelligence agencies are beginning to remove the tentacles and remove the face sucker from our face.
[00:07:05.437 --> 00:07:11.499]  But it's got tentacles still wrapped around our arm, trying to get back on our neck, trying to get back on our face.
[00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:12.659]  But every day,
[00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:17.721]  That we pull hard and focus and pray but are politically active.
[00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:29.366]  The face sucker gets further and further away and its tentacles get looser and looser and it is now desperately in its final last gasp gambit.
[00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:32.727]  Trying to get back on our face and suffocate us.
[00:07:32.727 --> 00:07:34.608]  That's the best way to describe them.
[00:07:34.608 --> 00:07:36.329]  Look at these headlines on Drudge.
[00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:37.549]  Great!
[00:07:37.549 --> 00:07:38.870]  Not just America, but great.
[00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:45.613]  GDP revised up 3.3.
[00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:46.553]  They made fun of Trump.
[00:07:46.553 --> 00:07:47.334]  They made fun of everybody.
[00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:55.838]  They said it'll never hit 3% because Obama could never hit 3%.
[00:07:55.838 --> 00:07:57.759]  Think about that.
[00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:58.759]  Think about that.
[00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:00.840]  Could never do it.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:00.940]  3.3.
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.543]  If he gets these moderate tax cuts through, they're talking 7 to 10% growth rate, just like China's got.
[00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:14.470]  Meanwhile, John McCain again stands in the way of the Obamacare repeal and of the tax cuts.
[00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:20.895]  He's the one vote that we don't have and it looks like it's all down to him again.
[00:08:20.895 --> 00:08:29.162]  And some people have pointed out that he's in photos wearing the boot on the left leg and the right leg and that it's all fake.
[00:08:29.162 --> 00:08:31.404]  And that the brain tumor's fake to give him sympathy.
[00:08:31.404 --> 00:08:32.124]  No.
[00:08:32.124 --> 00:08:33.806]  You can see he's a dying man.
[00:08:34.844 --> 00:08:36.285]  You can look at him neurologically.
[00:08:36.285 --> 00:08:38.206]  He has trouble speaking now.
[00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:39.527]  That is not an act.
[00:08:39.527 --> 00:08:43.529]  He's probably so bombed out of his brain, he just puts the boot on the wrong foot some days.
[00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:49.592]  Because it is true, he's wearing the boot in different videos and photos the last month on different feet every other day.
[00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:52.434]  So, he is in cloud cuckoo land.
[00:08:52.434 --> 00:08:54.035]  And so I feel really sorry for him.
[00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:59.778]  I don't wish horrible things really on anybody, even though he's a globalist and done a lot of bad things.
[00:08:59.778 --> 00:09:02.420]  It just doesn't seem like good luck to revel in that.
[00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:16.922]  But if you go to Infowars.com and Newswars.com, there is just so much really important news that we're going to be getting to today that I'm going to be breaking down.
[00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:19.966]  We have what's really behind Matt Lauer's firing.
[00:09:19.966 --> 00:09:20.707]  I'm going to get into that.
[00:09:21.787 --> 00:09:25.890]  And Weinstein facing sex trafficking, kidnapping charges.
[00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:31.733]  We're also going to get into a bunch of disinfo in the news, claiming that I have said no one was shot at Vegas.
[00:09:31.733 --> 00:09:34.635]  That is a total and complete lie.
[00:09:34.635 --> 00:09:37.096]  But that's what mainstream fake news does.
[00:09:37.096 --> 00:09:40.458]  They misrepresent everything to try to manipulate people.
[00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:48.243]  Because we're dead on with intel about exactly what did happen there.
[00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:56.641]  And the whistleblower we had on was picked up by the FBI for reporting it, but still doesn't want his name known to the public.
[00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:58.523]  And again, it's a totally real source.
[00:09:58.523 --> 00:10:00.625]  So real, the FBI was there in two hours.
[00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:03.727]  So real, he's now left the country.
[00:10:03.727 --> 00:10:13.776]  And when it all comes out and his name is known, he's been in a couple hundred newspapers before and very respected in the Army Special Operations Intelligence Community.
[00:10:15.356 --> 00:10:16.937]  So it's a big deal.
[00:10:16.937 --> 00:10:20.098]  And he said on air who was involved and what was going on.
[00:10:20.098 --> 00:10:20.778]  You can look it up.
[00:10:20.778 --> 00:10:22.358]  The Saudis were there.
[00:10:22.358 --> 00:10:24.939]  They were having military convention there.
[00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:34.842]  And the report is it was a spillover in the Saudi civil war that's ongoing right now with thousands arrested, hundreds dead, helicopters blowing up, mass shootouts.
[00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:37.343]  Most of it gets covered up in the news, but that's what happened.
[00:10:41.129 --> 00:10:42.511]  As best intel we have.
[00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:44.933]  And that's what my FBI sources have said.
[00:10:44.933 --> 00:10:49.979]  Absolutely, Alex, we can't give you any more information, but you're on the trail.
[00:10:49.979 --> 00:10:52.922]  So, what do they do when something like that comes out?
[00:10:52.922 --> 00:11:01.151]  They just change the subject and edit quotes I've made where it makes no sense talking to a caller and just sounds crazy.
[00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:10.868]  But if you wanna actually hear the interview that had the FBI actually, you know, go detain the individual for two days, well, we'll put it back on screen so I can give it to radio listeners.
[00:11:10.868 --> 00:11:13.568]  Here is the headline where you can find the interview.
[00:11:13.568 --> 00:11:21.151]  Breaking Intel, Saudi Arabia connection to Vegas, more attacks could be coming.
[00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:30.834]  And of course, this is all before the civil war openly kicked off in Saudi Arabia that the guest told everybody about and what was about to happen and who was about to be rounded up.
[00:11:31.803 --> 00:11:48.516]  Because this individual is from an American father and a Muslim mother and has been raised in the Middle East and so has been involved in all those major obvious black ops where you need people that speak Arabic and Farsi and all the rest of that.
[00:11:48.516 --> 00:11:55.201]  So that's why they're so upset about this source and the information that they don't want you to know.
[00:11:55.201 --> 00:11:57.083]  And the media spun it like I was blaming Trump.
[00:11:58.083 --> 00:11:59.784]  I wasn't blaming Trump.
[00:11:59.784 --> 00:12:15.071]  I said it's part of the civil war going on now that Trump has gone in and actually made a deal to not have ISIS and Al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia anymore, and to have Saudi Arabia announce that they're actually not going to play a double game, but they're going to declare total war on it and shut it down.
[00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:17.112]  You heard that months ago from Zach.
[00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.053]  That's his real first name.
[00:12:19.053 --> 00:12:20.994]  People can do some ferreting and figure out who he is.
[00:12:24.005 --> 00:12:25.706]  That fit into all my other sources.
[00:12:25.706 --> 00:12:27.487]  I didn't just believe Zach.
[00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:37.475]  And so now, two days ago, Saudi Arabia and 42 other nations declare total war on Wahhabist Islam, which has been coming out of their country.
[00:12:37.475 --> 00:12:41.377]  Instead of exporting it over here, they're saying we're done.
[00:12:41.377 --> 00:12:48.422]  Trump applauds defeat of ISIS, promises to promote lasting peace in Syria and justice for terrorists.
[00:12:48.422 --> 00:12:51.765]  And they've actually cut off ISIS, smashed it, and have basically destroyed it.
[00:12:53.066 --> 00:12:56.568]  By cutting off its supporters in Saudi Arabia?
[00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:57.748]  They've been arrested?
[00:12:57.748 --> 00:12:59.389]  They've been killed?
[00:12:59.389 --> 00:13:01.950]  They've been blown up?
[00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.551]  They've been hung by their feet?
[00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:05.772]  Until they told them where the terrorist cells were?
[00:13:05.772 --> 00:13:12.176]  And I'm not defending that, but you better believe people got tortured big time inside the Rich Carlton there in Saudi Arabia.
[00:13:15.478 --> 00:13:17.520]  That's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.401]  You want ISIS and Al-Qaeda smashed?
[00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:22.584]  You don't want double-deal globalists and the CIA working with them?
[00:13:22.584 --> 00:13:24.386]  Trump came in and said, it's over.
[00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:26.648]  Kill them all!
[00:13:26.648 --> 00:13:34.054]  The day he got elected, he went over to the CIA, and they closed the doors with all the head people, and he said, we're not playing these games anymore.
[00:13:34.054 --> 00:13:35.555]  You're either with me or against me.
[00:13:35.555 --> 00:13:42.261]  We're gonna kill the entire leadership of ISIS and Al-Qaeda, and I catch anybody double-dealing, you're going to prison.
[00:13:42.261 --> 00:13:43.142]  Or worse, you understand?
[00:13:46.431 --> 00:13:54.564]  And I've talked to two people that were there, and let me tell you, he handed out little wooden American flag plaques to everybody.
[00:13:54.564 --> 00:13:55.745]  That's so the CIA can know.
[00:13:56.613 --> 00:13:58.734]  There you go.
[00:13:58.734 --> 00:14:06.437]  So, that's why they all completely freaked out, and the networks in Saudi Arabia freaked out, because they were running this, and they've been striking back at the U.S.
[00:14:06.437 --> 00:14:13.640]  and funding Antifund, funding Linda Sorcerer, and funding all these groups, through Soros, and it's all coming to an end!
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.361]  Your networks are smashed!
[00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:16.502]  You've been cut off!
[00:14:16.502 --> 00:14:17.582]  You've been destroyed!
[00:14:17.582 --> 00:14:18.923]  And now they've got headless
[00:14:19.543 --> 00:14:30.028]  Cells still in the West that you've seen activating and bombing and attacking because their last order was, if you don't get more orders from us, start bombing, start killing.
[00:14:30.028 --> 00:14:33.849]  So you've got headless chickens running around spewing blood out.
[00:14:33.849 --> 00:14:36.731]  They don't have long and they're getting rounded up right now.
[00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:38.932]  You want to smash radical Islam, baby?
[00:14:38.932 --> 00:14:40.012]  It's happening.
[00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:46.235]  Not double dealing, not double games, not Machiavellian crap, but decapitation.
[00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:47.535]  Bye bye.
[00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:48.496]  Done.
[00:14:48.496 --> 00:14:48.676]  Over.
[00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:52.031]  That's what Trump's doing.
[00:14:52.031 --> 00:14:53.512]  Delivering on the economy.
[00:14:53.512 --> 00:14:54.832]  Delivering on the border.
[00:14:54.832 --> 00:14:56.893]  Delivering on medical care to the veterans.
[00:14:56.893 --> 00:14:59.154]  Delivering on bringing jobs back.
[00:14:59.154 --> 00:15:04.536]  Delivering on breaking the back of political correctness that is so whacked out it's telling us we can't even...
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.561]  Say Merry Christmas or Mother or Father or White Christmas is banned?
[00:15:10.561 --> 00:15:19.942]  And man, let me tell you something, I love everybody of every color, every, you name it, but I get in these Uber cabs, and last night, one of my security people flew back in from seeing family.
[00:15:19.942 --> 00:15:29.284]  There was a guy from Nigeria in the car, playing the most anti-kill Whitey, take him out, all this stuff, while he's in the Uber, with a white guy in the back.
[00:15:29.284 --> 00:15:33.825]  And I've just got stacks of news where the left is trying to invoke a race war in this country.
[00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:35.486]  And it's just everywhere.
[00:15:35.486 --> 00:15:36.727]  I can't even get away from it.
[00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:38.568]  This is all artificial.
[00:15:38.568 --> 00:15:40.129]  It's a joke.
[00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:44.313]  Two years ago, African people migrating to the U.S.
[00:15:44.313 --> 00:15:45.914]  weren't like this.
[00:15:45.914 --> 00:15:47.855]  They've been filled with hatred.
[00:15:47.855 --> 00:15:50.397]  But now America and the world is waking up.
[00:15:50.397 --> 00:15:57.183]  What really happened to Matt Lauer and the next shoe to drop, the North Korea situation, the economy roaring back.
[00:15:57.183 --> 00:15:58.664]  More intel on Hillary straight ahead.
[00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:01.203]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.

[00:16:06.026 --> 00:16:08.869]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:16:08.869 --> 00:16:09.529]  Awesome!
[00:16:09.529 --> 00:16:12.612]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.

[00:16:18.957 --> 00:16:20.398]  Or warm and served.
[00:16:20.398 --> 00:16:22.440]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.401]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:16:29.178 --> 00:16:34.300]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.982]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:16:39.982 --> 00:16:45.185]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.

[00:17:27.836 --> 00:17:31.917]  It's like having an electric power plant running secretly in your own home.

[00:18:29.017 --> 00:18:29.257]  Woo!
[00:18:29.257 --> 00:18:30.297]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:18:30.297 --> 00:18:39.041]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:18:39.041 --> 00:18:47.083]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:24.903]  We now take you live.
[00:20:24.903 --> 00:20:31.725]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:31.725 --> 00:20:36.646]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:36.646 --> 00:20:40.947]  Look at this Paul Joseph Watson article with video coming up in the next segment.
[00:20:40.947 --> 00:20:42.487]  Katie Couric flashback.
[00:20:42.487 --> 00:20:45.468]  Matt Lauer pinches me on the rear end a lot.
[00:20:46.755 --> 00:20:48.796]  She said the other word.
[00:20:48.796 --> 00:20:52.797]  NBC host predatory behavior seems to have been widespread.
[00:20:52.797 --> 00:20:58.199]  Yeah, they had joke skits about it all over television.
[00:20:58.199 --> 00:21:07.162]  Just like they had the cartoons where babies have escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement.
[00:21:07.162 --> 00:21:13.104]  So it's just overwhelming the amount of news we have right now that is just exposing these people.
[00:21:13.104 --> 00:21:13.964]  But during the break,
[00:21:17.165 --> 00:21:31.895]  I saw documented evidence that is so over the top from WikiLeaks and certain individuals that have been attacking President Trump.
[00:21:31.895 --> 00:21:39.080]  And then we did more research and it got a lot worse from that point.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.441]  It got a lot worse from that point.
[00:21:40.441 --> 00:21:43.043]  I mean, this is so crazy what I saw during the break.
[00:21:43.922 --> 00:21:49.347]  from my researchers, that I can hardly even continue doing my show right now.
[00:21:49.347 --> 00:22:05.903]  Because we already know who they are, we already know what they're up to, we already know what makes them tick, but just, it just keeps getting confirmed in triplicate, and I'm not at liberty to talk about some things at this point that soon I'll be able to, but let me just tell you something.
[00:22:05.903 --> 00:22:07.805]  This is beyond a James Bond movie right now.
[00:22:08.775 --> 00:22:12.637]  And all eyes are on us, and I don't say that even in a positive way.
[00:22:12.637 --> 00:22:24.623]  I wish that all eyes were on other people that knew this information, because I'm not trying to ask for it.
[00:22:24.623 --> 00:22:34.148]  I mean, I don't want to die, but I also don't want to be a slave, and I don't want my children to be slaves, but nobody's got a pay grade for this.
[00:22:35.805 --> 00:22:37.346]  I can't keep track of it all.
[00:22:37.346 --> 00:22:38.387]  It's mountainous.
[00:22:38.387 --> 00:22:39.789]  It's insane.
[00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:42.491]  It's crazy.
[00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:49.438]  And it's like, you know, do I want to expose sex orgies on Air Force One with grown adults?
[00:22:49.438 --> 00:22:58.326]  Because that distracts away from little kids getting kidnapped and raped, which we've got confirmed, man.
[00:22:58.326 --> 00:22:58.986]  Guys, put that down.
[00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:00.428]  I'm not ready to go to that.
[00:23:00.428 --> 00:23:01.469]  Don't put it up yet.
[00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:24.466]  I gotta do a big, this has got to be done with major, major buildup, major, we've already vetted it, but I just, I just cannot believe that we are actually in the grasp of these monsters.
[00:23:24.466 --> 00:23:29.709]  I mean, it's so real, folks.
[00:23:29.709 --> 00:23:31.810]  The Deputy Pope has been arrested.
[00:23:33.271 --> 00:23:42.055]  The number two guy in the Vatican for kidnapping and trafficking over a hundred little boys over 40 years.
[00:23:42.055 --> 00:23:52.120]  And they use the kids to blackmail the Vatican so that the current black pope, Jesuit pope, who's really a communist, could take control of the Vatican.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.362]  And that's all confirmed.
[00:23:55.362 --> 00:24:00.625]  And I was telling some lawyers, high-powered lawyers I was on the phone with from DC,
[00:24:01.801 --> 00:24:04.344]  Some things we're getting ready to do this week about it.
[00:24:04.344 --> 00:24:05.125]  And they said, really?
[00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:07.787]  And I sent one of them the article while we were talking.
[00:24:07.787 --> 00:24:08.868]  He said, I can't believe it.
[00:24:08.868 --> 00:24:09.929]  I didn't even know that.
[00:24:09.929 --> 00:24:17.837]  If that's what I mean, like the deputy Pope gets caught bringing in over 100 little boys to compromise everybody.
[00:24:17.837 --> 00:24:20.060]  You bring in some little boy to me, I'm going to break your neck.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.281]  What do you mean compromise?
[00:24:21.281 --> 00:24:23.123]  Where did they get all these people?
[00:24:23.123 --> 00:24:24.845]  How did they find so many people?
[00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:30.683]  Can you imagine somebody bringing a five-year-old girl in a dress, saying, hey, let's rape her!
[00:24:30.683 --> 00:24:33.965]  It's just like, who are you people?
[00:24:33.965 --> 00:24:37.008]  And that's why I'm not afraid of these people.
[00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:46.896]  It's why I just want to spend my life judiciously and focused like a missile, like a weapon system, to make sure that I take them out.
[00:24:46.896 --> 00:24:51.159]  That's my great frustration, is that I pray to God to lead God and direct me.
[00:24:51.159 --> 00:24:53.321]  Please, Jesus, and please, Father.
[00:24:54.747 --> 00:24:55.688]  Send the Holy Ghost.
[00:24:55.688 --> 00:24:56.408]  Send the discernment.
[00:24:56.408 --> 00:24:59.191]  I know I've already got it, but I need more.
[00:24:59.191 --> 00:25:01.893]  I need God to just fully take control of me, because I am a weak vessel.
[00:25:03.476 --> 00:25:04.517]  God doesn't really do that.
[00:25:04.517 --> 00:25:05.917]  God gives you free will.
[00:25:05.917 --> 00:25:16.422]  But man, I just want to be sanctified, purified, and raised up against the enemy, not out of any type of power trip, but because I've already committed myself to this.
[00:25:16.422 --> 00:25:18.143]  I know how dangerous it is.
[00:25:18.143 --> 00:25:20.705]  I want to defeat the enemy.
[00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:22.425]  I want to be worthy.
[00:25:22.425 --> 00:25:25.367]  Just knowing this stuff makes me feel bad.
[00:25:25.367 --> 00:25:29.869]  I feel evil just knowing all this stuff.
[00:25:29.869 --> 00:25:31.250]  I feel guilty for them!
[00:25:34.502 --> 00:25:43.024]  And it's all the same people, they all have that same little demon look, little jolly look in their eyes.
[00:25:43.024 --> 00:25:50.506]  I mean, I was watching one of these guys on TV just yesterday, and I thought, man, that guy looks like a pedophile.
[00:25:50.506 --> 00:25:53.427]  And then, holy Toledo, boom, there it is again.
[00:25:53.427 --> 00:26:00.388]  It's like, wow, they have a spirit, they have a look, they have a behavior, and they can't hide it.
[00:26:00.388 --> 00:26:02.489]  They look like demons.
[00:26:02.489 --> 00:26:03.329]  They look like
[00:26:05.905 --> 00:26:10.050]  Just seething, power-tripping, arrogant, greedy creatures.
[00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.595]  And the worst thing they can do is to hurt children.
[00:26:13.595 --> 00:26:16.779]  And so that's why they like it, because it's all about them.
[00:26:16.779 --> 00:26:22.186]  And all about them doing what they want, and doing bad things, because that gets them closer to their God.
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.922]  Like, I want to be a better person to get closer to God.
[00:26:26.922 --> 00:26:29.964]  They want to be worse to get close to THEIR God!
[00:26:29.964 --> 00:26:30.925]  And that's what it is!
[00:26:30.925 --> 00:26:33.807]  They're devil-worshipping pedophiles!
[00:26:33.807 --> 00:26:34.968]  I've got hundreds of stories.
[00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:36.009]  They're all riveting.
[00:26:36.009 --> 00:26:36.790]  It's all important.
[00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.710]  Tons of clips.
[00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:38.591]  Guests coming on.
[00:26:38.591 --> 00:26:39.251]  Research.
[00:26:39.251 --> 00:26:39.792]  All of it.
[00:26:39.792 --> 00:26:41.833]  But I just want to tell you again.
[00:26:41.833 --> 00:26:47.298]  We're facing people committed to evil, committed to being nasty.
[00:26:47.298 --> 00:26:48.639]  They'd go out of their way
[00:26:49.977 --> 00:26:51.119]  To screw somebody over.
[00:26:51.119 --> 00:26:53.902]  They go out of their way to hurt somebody who's innocent.
[00:26:53.902 --> 00:26:55.945]  That's who they are!
[00:26:55.945 --> 00:26:57.006]  And they're all their statements.
[00:26:57.006 --> 00:27:05.838]  We hate flyover country, and we hate churches, and we hate Christians, and we hate... We hate God, and all of this stuff.
[00:27:11.618 --> 00:27:12.878]  And they mean it, man.
[00:27:12.878 --> 00:27:15.239]  They want to destroy you.
[00:27:15.239 --> 00:27:19.801]  That's where they're going, that's their destination, that's their God, that's their world.
[00:27:19.801 --> 00:27:25.783]  To have their way with you and your children, and look what Hollywood does, and the sexualization, and all of it.
[00:27:25.783 --> 00:27:29.905]  They are the scum of the Earth!
[00:27:29.905 --> 00:27:37.768]  I'm gonna go to break and come back and get into the rest of the story on this, the missiles, the whole North Korea situation, which is going to war, okay?
[00:27:38.755 --> 00:27:40.136]  That whole thing's out of control.
[00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:41.676]  We need to turn this around.
[00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:49.359]  I feel very sorry for the North Korean people, but the North Korean leadership are just the same little demon cult.
[00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:51.840]  I guarantee you Kim Jong-un's a pedophile.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.440]  We know he's a sex pervert.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.642]  His dad was, had a seven-story pleasure palace, would kidnap underage women and stuff from Japan.
[00:27:58.642 --> 00:28:02.004]  I mean, they'd hijack planes to get women he wanted.
[00:28:02.004 --> 00:28:02.564]  Kim Jong-il.
[00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:08.351]  But please don't forget we've extended Cyber Week, but this says Cyber Week.
[00:28:08.351 --> 00:28:09.932]  We can't do this more than a few days.
[00:28:09.932 --> 00:28:12.013]  Caveman has sold out.
[00:28:12.013 --> 00:28:14.575]  Brain Force is about to sell out.
[00:28:14.575 --> 00:28:16.436]  Winter Sun has sold out.
[00:28:16.436 --> 00:28:20.318]  A bunch of things have sold out, so they're not for sale.
[00:28:20.318 --> 00:28:27.562]  I'm keeping it at 50% off on Brain Force, even though it's close to selling out, because we're getting some more end of December, January.

[00:28:56.898 --> 00:28:57.458]  It's powerful.
[00:28:59.253 --> 00:29:00.253]  Hey, Daniel Brinkman.
[00:29:00.253 --> 00:29:02.594]  Why Numana Storeable Foods?

[00:29:29.042 --> 00:29:31.663]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[00:29:31.663 --> 00:29:32.684]  That's true.
[00:29:32.684 --> 00:29:37.747]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?

[00:30:00.948 --> 00:30:04.071]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:30:04.071 --> 00:30:11.498]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:30:11.498 --> 00:30:17.123]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:30:17.863 --> 00:30:25.530]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:33.477]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:30:34.137 --> 00:30:39.200]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.321]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:54.728]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:31:03.114 --> 00:31:07.300]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:14.911]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:31:14.911 --> 00:31:17.232]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[00:31:17.232 --> 00:31:18.992]  B vitamins we need every day.
[00:31:18.992 --> 00:31:24.294]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:31:24.294 --> 00:31:26.574]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[00:31:26.574 --> 00:31:32.256]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[00:31:32.256 --> 00:31:32.636]  Secret 12.
[00:31:34.096 --> 00:31:34.657]  I think so.

[00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:40.594]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain, and overall brain fog.

[00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:04.152]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:28.374]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:40.771 --> 00:33:42.372]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:33:42.372 --> 00:33:55.359]  You know, when I talk about information overload, the media is trying to act like Project Veritas got caught with an egg on its face for shitting a woman into Infiltrate to show how they're biased concerning Judge Roy Moore.
[00:33:55.359 --> 00:33:59.702]  And then, of course, The Washington Post is run by leftist elements of the CIA publicly.
[00:33:59.702 --> 00:34:09.748]  That's now admitted and funded and owned by Jeff Bezos and an additional 500 million plus CIA dollars that Obama gave it one month before he left office criminally.
[00:34:10.865 --> 00:34:30.754]  But if you look at that and expand on it, now they have video that's up on Infowars.com where the Washington Post national security reporter admits evidence of Russian collusion maybe doesn't exist at all and says it's all an effing crapshoot.
[00:34:30.754 --> 00:34:32.615]  We're just desperate to make something stick.
[00:34:35.242 --> 00:34:39.746]  So, I mean, that's the type of stuff we've got that we're going to be playing here today.
[00:34:39.746 --> 00:34:42.148]  It's total overload.
[00:34:42.148 --> 00:34:52.797]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump tweets well-known videos of Muslims in Libya, in Syria, and in Egypt throwing gays off buildings.
[00:34:52.797 --> 00:34:54.198]  Those are real videos.
[00:34:54.198 --> 00:34:55.839]  They've never been denied.
[00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:58.682]  Videos of Dutch children being beaten up by Muslims.
[00:34:58.682 --> 00:34:59.843]  Reporters being beaten up.
[00:35:01.878 --> 00:35:02.339]  U.S.
[00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:15.175]  media runs it and says Trump tweets what he claims is Muslims attacking people, or Muslims doing bad things.
[00:35:15.175 --> 00:35:20.062]  So this is the type of garbage that's going on, and this is the types of deception.
[00:35:22.429 --> 00:35:26.350]  So, everybody knows that Islam takes over countries it comes into.
[00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:31.631]  Everybody knows they're hyping this whole anti-Americanism, anti-Europe garbage.
[00:35:31.631 --> 00:35:34.772]  And I've got a bunch of news on that I'm going to get into.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:42.393]  Where arrogant Jean-Paul Junkers of the Nazi dynasty.
[00:35:42.393 --> 00:35:44.054]  I mean, you talk about a real Nazi.
[00:35:44.054 --> 00:35:46.074]  His grandfather took over Luxembourg.
[00:35:46.074 --> 00:35:50.235]  They still personally own it by right of just capturing it through military
[00:35:51.704 --> 00:35:52.207]  Conquest?
[00:35:54.059 --> 00:35:56.460]  Richest country per capita in the world, Luxembourg.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.360]  His grandfather took it.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.440]  His father was a famous Nazi.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.741]  He's reviving the EU that his grandfather actually envisioned for the Nazis.
[00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:10.122]  Juncker's grandfather is actually sourced as the guy that developed the plan for the Nazis.
[00:36:10.122 --> 00:36:16.824]  Now they're one of the most famous royal families of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire that existed previously.
[00:36:16.824 --> 00:36:21.525]  So their German royalty, he's related to the British royals, all the rest of them.
[00:36:22.665 --> 00:36:25.807]  And he says that we must have migrants.
[00:36:25.807 --> 00:36:28.649]  He says, without millions of African migrants, Europe will be lost.
[00:36:28.649 --> 00:36:29.370]  That's a close quote.
[00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:30.491]  Here's another one.
[00:36:30.491 --> 00:36:31.391]  Jean-Paul Juncker.
[00:36:31.391 --> 00:36:33.493]  Migrants need legal ways to come to Europe.
[00:36:33.493 --> 00:36:34.514]  Well, you're already bringing them there.
[00:36:34.514 --> 00:36:35.915]  10 million in the last few years.
[00:36:35.915 --> 00:36:40.778]  Meanwhile, Macron knows he's about to move from office, like Merkel is about to be, if he doesn't act populist.
[00:36:40.778 --> 00:36:45.061]  So he says African traffickers are responsible for Libya's slave trade.
[00:36:45.061 --> 00:36:49.565]  No, you are, your government is, previously, for overthrowing Libya.
[00:36:50.285 --> 00:36:54.609]  And then now letting radical Muslims in that sell men, women, and children in slavery.
[00:36:54.609 --> 00:36:56.430]  It's Islam!
[00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:01.174]  But no one will say it's Islam that's running modern slavery!
[00:37:01.174 --> 00:37:12.143]  Instead, it's like the anti-slavery group and we learn our morals from Linda Sorcerer when she's not talking about taking a pair of loppers to women's genitals.
[00:37:12.143 --> 00:37:13.084]  But here's the good news.
[00:37:14.873 --> 00:37:18.235]  And I want to, next hour, read this in its entirety, his statement.
[00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:19.275]  Day of Reckoning!
[00:37:19.275 --> 00:37:33.842]  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai slammed Silicon Valley for censoring conservatives and says, how dare you censor members of Congress on Twitter and Facebook and Google.
[00:37:33.842 --> 00:37:43.166]  How dare you talk about a free open internet when we had net neutrality and then Obama called it net neutrality last year and handed it over to the UN and multinationals.
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:51.044]  And now you violated net neutrality under the name net neutrality and they play these semantical games.
[00:37:51.044 --> 00:37:54.046]  He says we're going back to where the U.S.
[00:37:54.046 --> 00:37:56.067]  ran the internet because we created it.
[00:37:56.067 --> 00:37:57.508]  We're not giving it to the U.N.
[00:37:57.508 --> 00:38:02.131]  or George Soros's foundations because his foundations advises the U.N.
[00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:07.195]  and advises Google and advises Facebook and Twitter and pays!
[00:38:07.195 --> 00:38:09.096]  Go look it up!
[00:38:09.096 --> 00:38:11.958]  For the groups that censor and delist and control.
[00:38:11.958 --> 00:38:13.619]  Soros is literally
[00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.571]  In control.
[00:38:16.571 --> 00:38:24.296]  His stinking $18 billion tax-exempt money he swindled out of stock market crashes, you name it.
[00:38:24.296 --> 00:38:31.280]  $18 billion separate from all his other wealth that he uses like a battering ram to try to destroy this country.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.280]  Well, guess what?
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:40.585]  Once people are aware of you, no amount of your money will buy you the pissing contest you wanted to have, Mr. Soros, mounting America's head on the wall.
[00:38:42.096 --> 00:38:44.479]  Hunting season's over for America!
[00:38:44.479 --> 00:38:49.025]  Hunting season, politically, is open on you, buster!
[00:38:49.025 --> 00:38:50.767]  And you're so stupid!
[00:38:50.767 --> 00:38:57.256]  The stuff you're funding behind the scenes, that we have all the intel on, you think we're gonna have a one-dimensional fight with you?
[00:38:57.256 --> 00:39:00.039]  Where we're just gonna address what you're gonna launch on us next week?
[00:39:00.956 --> 00:39:09.441]  We're gonna hit you with all the intel we've been saving, and all the angles, and you're so dumb, look at who you're gonna use to go after us.
[00:39:09.441 --> 00:39:12.522]  This is a gift, actually.
[00:39:12.522 --> 00:39:15.164]  Wait, wait if they're dumb enough, folks.
[00:39:15.164 --> 00:39:18.165]  We want to be able to announce the next week or two to you.
[00:39:18.165 --> 00:39:20.527]  You'll see it announced by the media first with their spin on it.
[00:39:20.527 --> 00:39:22.928]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:39:22.928 --> 00:39:27.791]  When you see who they're dumb enough to publicly send after me, you're not gonna believe it.
[00:39:28.516 --> 00:39:31.638]  You're not going to believe it!
[00:39:31.638 --> 00:39:39.581]  You know, I'm two inches away from just releasing all this tomorrow.
[00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:40.542]  I think I'm gonna do that.
[00:39:47.691 --> 00:39:52.554]  What's crazy is they've been pushing third world countries around, they've been pushing Muslims around using radical Muslims.
[00:39:52.554 --> 00:40:00.200]  They've had it so long with air superiority and arrogance that these people thought they could do anything they wanted, however, whenever.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.443]  And they just don't get the tide has turned against you massive.
[00:40:04.443 --> 00:40:12.669]  And you're sitting there figuring it out as waves ten times, twenty times, thirty times, a hundred times, a thousand times.
[00:40:12.669 --> 00:40:14.370]  I'm actually scared of the waves coming in.
[00:40:15.987 --> 00:40:21.649]  The change is going to be so dramatic and you arrogant SOBs still haven't figured it out.
[00:40:21.649 --> 00:40:23.910]  So that's all coming up.
[00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.291]  But good stuff's happening.
[00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:31.113]  Pai has votes to repeal Obamacare, Obama-era net neutrality rules.
[00:40:31.113 --> 00:40:32.254]  Really scary news though.
[00:40:32.254 --> 00:40:33.194]  I told you this was coming.
[00:40:33.194 --> 00:40:34.274]  I told you it was coming.
[00:40:34.274 --> 00:40:39.556]  I told you it was coming a decade ago when Soros was behind the whole marijuana legalization deal.
[00:40:39.556 --> 00:40:44.659]  And then the way they wrote the regulations that his group wrote for all those states, was it 18 states now?
[00:40:46.269 --> 00:40:47.410]  Or more?
[00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.171]  Like 24 have somewhat of legalization.
[00:40:50.171 --> 00:40:53.012]  It turns you into a ward of the state when you sign the paperwork.
[00:40:53.012 --> 00:40:56.093]  Your children and your guns are taken.
[00:40:56.093 --> 00:40:57.154]  Look at this.
[00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:57.934]  Daily Caller.
[00:40:57.934 --> 00:41:06.257]  Hawaiian police order people with medical pot to surrender guns to state police.
[00:41:06.257 --> 00:41:07.578]  Contrast that with Trump.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:17.025]  Trump to permit citizens to buy army surplus pistols, reversing something Obama did six years ago, banning all military surplus from being sold to the public.
[00:41:17.025 --> 00:41:26.250]  Now the military can make money, the citizens get high quality Beretta firearms at a very, very low price, and just not having to house the guns will save the U.S.
[00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.552]  $200,000 a day.
[00:41:29.552 --> 00:41:32.354]  So that's all coming up, but first, just briefly.
[00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:37.874]  I put a good face on this because that's what needs to be done.
[00:41:37.874 --> 00:41:48.045]  And in reality, that's the way to be optimistic and understand the destiny, understand history, but also politically, using the truth, know how to defeat the globals on every front.
[00:41:49.295 --> 00:41:58.543]  But it takes number one, prayer, number two, spreading the articles and the videos to get around the enemy at newswars.com, infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[00:41:58.543 --> 00:42:05.990]  And it takes you being vocal and calling C-SPAN and calling Talk Radio or calling our local affiliates and thanking them or becoming sponsors.
[00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.433]  It just calls for your optimism and your energy and your focus.
[00:42:09.433 --> 00:42:12.436]  And when you get off the couch, when you get off the porch, you're unstoppable.
[00:42:13.536 --> 00:42:15.378]  And it calls for financial support.
[00:42:15.378 --> 00:42:32.151]  And if you need water filtration the very best, or air filtration, or water filtration for your showers, or bathtubs, or clothes, or survival gear, or high quality supplements, whatever the very best highest rate is, we go out and get it and discount it many times below even Amazon prices.
[00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:34.313]  And then we fight for liberty and fight for freedom.
[00:42:34.853 --> 00:42:36.915]  Your money is a 360 win on that.
[00:42:36.915 --> 00:42:40.858]  So bet on freedom, bet on the Infowar, bet on yourself like you've done.

[00:42:59.983 --> 00:43:00.784]  I'm so excited.
[00:43:00.784 --> 00:43:10.950]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:16.454]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:43:16.454 --> 00:43:19.456]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:43:19.456 --> 00:43:28.242]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:43:30.323 --> 00:43:49.916]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:43:49.916 --> 00:43:52.618]  It is amazing!
[00:43:52.618 --> 00:43:57.581]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:43:59.798 --> 00:44:03.740]  Enjoy all natural bath and beauty products with Emmerich's Essentials.

[00:44:51.239 --> 00:44:57.442]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:45:09.326 --> 00:45:20.151]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:22.272]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:45:22.272 --> 00:45:26.274]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:26.274 --> 00:45:33.517]  And I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:45:33.517 --> 00:45:35.898]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:45:35.898 --> 00:45:38.019]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr.
[00:45:38.539 --> 00:45:41.343]  That's my dad, with a little silver and iodine as well.
[00:45:41.343 --> 00:45:43.846]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:45:43.846 --> 00:45:53.036]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:45:53.036 --> 00:45:57.462]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:10.314]  Not content with an apology, alleged victims of Bill Clinton, Al Franken, John Conyers, Joe Barton and others have scheduled a press conference this week in Washington, D.C.
[00:46:10.314 --> 00:46:13.815]  In a press release, the women say, our message is clear.
[00:46:13.815 --> 00:46:17.937]  Both Senator Franken and Congressman Conyers must resign now.
[00:46:17.937 --> 00:46:24.840]  And Congress must end taxpayer-funded payouts to harassment victims in an effort to silence their voices and complaints.
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:31.103]  One of the women is just the latest to come forward, accusing former President Bill Clinton of sexual crimes.
[00:46:31.103 --> 00:46:44.408]  Leslie Milley said she was very prepared to come forward and talk about her encounters with Bill Clinton in the 80s, but once the Monica Lewinsky story broke, she feared not only the media storm that would result, but also Hillary Clinton herself.
[00:46:44.408 --> 00:46:53.452]  Senator Franken is facing backlash for his lame attempt at an apology, while Congressman Conyers has stepped down as ranking member of House Judiciary Committee.
[00:46:53.712 --> 00:46:56.678]  So far, both lawmakers have refused to resign.
[00:46:56.678 --> 00:47:01.828]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[00:47:01.828 --> 00:47:04.553]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.736 --> 00:47:45.687]  Live from the IncoWorks.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:45.687 --> 00:47:48.329]  Escape from Kevin Spacey's basement!
[00:47:48.329 --> 00:47:48.649]  Help me!
[00:47:49.753 --> 00:47:50.273]  Help!
[00:47:50.273 --> 00:47:52.214]  I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement!
[00:47:52.214 --> 00:47:53.654]  Help me!
[00:47:53.654 --> 00:47:54.175]  Help!
[00:47:54.175 --> 00:47:56.115]  I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement!
[00:47:56.115 --> 00:47:57.556]  Help me!
[00:47:57.556 --> 00:47:58.076]  Help!
[00:47:58.076 --> 00:48:00.017]  I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement!
[00:48:00.017 --> 00:48:01.457]  Help me!
[00:48:01.457 --> 00:48:01.977]  Help!
[00:48:01.977 --> 00:48:03.918]  I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement!
[00:48:03.918 --> 00:48:04.398]  Help me!
[00:48:04.398 --> 00:48:09.360]  Alright, that's from the family guy five years ago.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.521]  And the reason I raised that is, you've got
[00:48:14.178 --> 00:48:26.147]  The LAPD and the NYPD investigating sex trafficking and sex enslavement by Harvey Weinstein and others in his orbit.
[00:48:26.147 --> 00:48:28.949]  Gee, imagine my shock and my surprise.
[00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:39.556]  Again, the media wants to make men hitting on women the big issue and unwanted advances paramount with pedophilia, child rape, men being raped, women being raped.
[00:48:39.556 --> 00:48:40.177]  That's what they're doing.
[00:48:41.049 --> 00:48:42.010]  They're smokescreening.
[00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:44.812]  They're watering down the overall story.
[00:48:44.812 --> 00:48:46.954]  It's an admitted tactic.
[00:48:46.954 --> 00:48:50.516]  But why is Matt Lauer being burned?
[00:48:50.516 --> 00:48:52.718]  I'm not defending what he's reportedly done.
[00:48:52.718 --> 00:48:54.880]  It's that it's a smokescreen.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.861]  Matt Lauer is a failure in the ratings.
[00:48:56.861 --> 00:48:58.742]  Matt Lauer is a failure.
[00:48:58.742 --> 00:48:59.883]  Just like Charlie Rose.
[00:48:59.883 --> 00:49:01.425]  Just like all these people.
[00:49:01.425 --> 00:49:02.966]  And so they've known about these cases.
[00:49:02.966 --> 00:49:04.267]  This is now admitted for years.
[00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:10.031]  But now they green light, it's safe to go public, more women go public.
[00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:12.532]  First it's one, then it's two, then it's five.
[00:49:12.532 --> 00:49:16.654]  And then now, oh, they're the good guys, they're the executives, they got rid of them.
[00:49:16.654 --> 00:49:19.916]  But where are the executives?
[00:49:19.916 --> 00:49:26.739]  Notice Trump tweeted about Matt Lauer last night, but said you should investigate the head of NBC and his behavior.
[00:49:26.739 --> 00:49:30.341]  See, Trump's going at the heart of it.
[00:49:30.341 --> 00:49:34.823]  They're burning people like Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose.
[00:49:37.705 --> 00:49:47.733]  For a woman walking by their studio, their dressing room, and seeing them in their underwear.
[00:49:47.733 --> 00:49:50.294]  Or hitting on somebody when they're drunk at the Olympics.
[00:49:50.294 --> 00:49:51.816]  And I'm not defending any of it.
[00:49:51.816 --> 00:49:56.079]  But they're taking that now and using it to cover up what the executives are doing.
[00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:58.801]  Let me tell you, the executives are on the wide-body jets.
[00:50:00.421 --> 00:50:06.992]  The executives, like Schmidt of Google, will be seen with 15 women getting on the big jet with hoods over their heads.
[00:50:06.992 --> 00:50:13.744]  He has bags put over their heads, just like Michael Jackson would do to people, so you can't tell who they are.
[00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:13.904]  See?
[00:50:14.898 --> 00:50:18.780]  So they're the royalty, and they're just burning the lower folks.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.481]  Weinstein's an executive, but his brother was sick of him.
[00:50:21.481 --> 00:50:22.721]  His brother pulled the trigger.
[00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:23.942]  This whole thing was planned.
[00:50:23.942 --> 00:50:28.404]  They couldn't contain it anymore, so they decided to engineer this whole event.
[00:50:28.404 --> 00:50:31.125]  And now you're seeing my breakdown of this confirmed.
[00:50:33.052 --> 00:50:41.197]  The failed dead weight of the media that couldn't deliver the election for Hillary, that couldn't get rid of Trump, they're now cutting bait.
[00:50:41.197 --> 00:50:42.818]  They can't reel back in the line.
[00:50:42.818 --> 00:50:57.166]  It's caught in the undergrowth at the bottom of the ocean, at the bottom of the lake, at the bottom of the river, at the bottom of the fjord, at the bottom of the lock, at the bottom of the fjord, and they are going to just cut the line.
[00:50:57.166 --> 00:50:59.607]  They're cutting bait right now.
[00:50:59.607 --> 00:51:00.948]  They're throwing in the towel.
[00:51:02.245 --> 00:51:06.166]  NBC fires Matt Lauer over sexual misconduct allegation.
[00:51:06.166 --> 00:51:14.169]  But notice they had other creepy shows about him hitting on women, and grabbing on women, and Katie Couric flashback, Matt Lauer pinches me on the butt a lot.
[00:51:14.169 --> 00:51:18.731]  In fact, here she is saying it.
[00:51:18.731 --> 00:51:21.452]  I did the Today Show with Matt Lauer for 15 years.
[00:51:21.452 --> 00:51:23.852]  What is Matt's most annoying habit?
[00:51:23.852 --> 00:51:28.454]  He pinches me on the ass a lot.
[00:51:30.962 --> 00:51:31.903]  So, there you go.
[00:51:31.903 --> 00:51:35.846]  They all knew nothing was done.
[00:51:35.846 --> 00:51:50.837]  Because now, if you got an oil field fire, Red Adair learned this almost 100 years ago, if you got an oil field fire going, you can't put it out with water, you can't throw dirt on it, you gotta roll up a big ol' wheelbarrow of dynamite, you gotta have a brave guy who's willing to do it.
[00:51:51.752 --> 00:52:02.715]  Believe me, he gets steak and beer bought for him every night, and he runs that wheelbarrow in there with a lit fuse right into that fire, and he runs back and jumps behind an armored barrier, and BOOM!
[00:52:02.715 --> 00:52:07.756]  An explosion goes off and cuts that oil well fire off.
[00:52:07.756 --> 00:52:12.177]  So they're using a controlled demolition to smokescreen, and the facts are all there!
[00:52:14.636 --> 00:52:18.139]  Now where to go with all these clips because I've got a bunch of them.
[00:52:18.139 --> 00:52:21.042]  Matt Lauer grills Bill O'Reilly on sexual assault.
[00:52:21.042 --> 00:52:30.091]  Yeah, he's the guy that brought up the recording of Trump saying women just throw themselves on you and then using the example of you can do anything you want.
[00:52:30.091 --> 00:52:33.614]  Like women throwing themselves at Elvis, throwing their panties at him.
[00:52:33.614 --> 00:52:35.075]  Elvis wasn't raping those women.
[00:52:35.075 --> 00:52:37.338]  They were throwing themselves up on you.
[00:52:39.306 --> 00:52:42.427]  It even ended up coming out in my custody trial of my children.
[00:52:42.427 --> 00:52:45.789]  I was saying, Trump's saying that isn't right, but it's in a locker room.
[00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:49.931]  A woman throws themself on you and you touch them, that's not assault.
[00:52:49.931 --> 00:52:51.832]  If she starts saying stop, then it is.
[00:52:51.832 --> 00:52:54.753]  But if someone's throwing themself on you, then it's not assault.
[00:52:54.753 --> 00:52:57.494]  The media spotted that, that I said it's okay to rape women.
[00:52:57.494 --> 00:52:57.935]  No.
[00:52:57.935 --> 00:53:07.239]  A woman throwing themself on you, and then you touching them to see if they want more, that's normal interaction.
[00:53:08.783 --> 00:53:09.963]  The motor's running.
[00:53:09.963 --> 00:53:11.964]  She wants to go.
[00:53:11.964 --> 00:53:15.586]  That's how it works.
[00:53:15.586 --> 00:53:16.706]  You say, oh, how far?
[00:53:16.706 --> 00:53:17.746]  I'm attracted to her.
[00:53:17.746 --> 00:53:18.747]  How far does she want to go?
[00:53:18.747 --> 00:53:19.947]  That's normal.
[00:53:19.947 --> 00:53:23.929]  They turn that into a criminal action, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:23.929 --> 00:53:32.512]  Meanwhile, they're involved in sex trafficking, raping, covering it up, using intelligence agencies, Mossad, leftist arms of the Mossad.
[00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.793]  NBC fires Matt Lauer over sexual misconduct.
[00:53:37.793 --> 00:53:43.658]  Matt Lauer allegedly sexually assaulted staffer during the Olympics.
[00:53:43.658 --> 00:53:48.162]  Matt Lauer fired by NBC for multiple sex misconduct claims now.
[00:53:48.162 --> 00:53:49.082]  The dam is breaking.
[00:53:49.082 --> 00:53:53.806]  NBC fires Matt Lauer after complaint about inappropriate sexual behavior.
[00:53:53.806 --> 00:53:55.148]  And then boom!
[00:53:55.148 --> 00:54:01.133]  Harvey Weinstein now faces sex trafficking charges in New York and DC.
[00:54:01.133 --> 00:54:02.334]  And in LA.
[00:54:04.602 --> 00:54:08.285]  Second staffer accuses Conyers of sexual harassment.
[00:54:08.285 --> 00:54:10.547]  Black caucus members urge U.S.
[00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:14.370]  Representative Conyers to resign.
[00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:19.714]  Former Conyers aide, most of us have seen him in his underwear, CNN.
[00:54:19.714 --> 00:54:25.919]  Sex victims demand Frank and Conyers resign.
[00:54:25.919 --> 00:54:28.241]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:54:28.241 --> 00:54:29.242]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:29.242 --> 00:54:31.064]  But meanwhile, Clinton ignores
[00:54:32.406 --> 00:54:36.550]  Democrats when asked about alleged sexual harassment in politics.
[00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:40.393]  NBC News fires Matt Lauer again.
[00:54:40.393 --> 00:54:44.437]  But she's all silent because she didn't just represent child molesters.
[00:54:44.437 --> 00:54:51.623]  She represented brutal child rapists and loved it and made jokes about it because these are monster people.
[00:54:51.623 --> 00:54:56.748]  You go prove in politics as a lawyer you're evil when the first jobs you got are representing child rapists.
[00:54:58.302 --> 00:55:04.964]  You know, a whole bunch of men kidnapping an 11-year-old girl, rape her half to death, shatter her cervix, ruin her, never gonna have children again.
[00:55:04.964 --> 00:55:07.225]  They think that's funny.
[00:55:07.225 --> 00:55:08.225]  It's all about her.
[00:55:08.225 --> 00:55:10.365]  It's about her power over you.
[00:55:10.365 --> 00:55:11.606]  And what's in the WikiLeaks?
[00:55:11.606 --> 00:55:16.727]  How she wants to keep you desperate, and alone, and in your mama's basement, and how much she hates you.
[00:55:16.727 --> 00:55:19.268]  So if you're delusional and go along with that, that's your issue.
[00:55:20.626 --> 00:55:26.503]  When I come back though, I'm gonna play a bizarre satire clip of NBC female host catching Matt Lauer in underwear.
[00:55:26.503 --> 00:55:28.769]  Women says he's making her lactate.
[00:55:29.994 --> 00:55:33.116]  So they make a weird, you know, mixed children in that, makes it more fun.
[00:55:33.116 --> 00:55:36.239]  Fifty Shades of Matt Lauer, Ellen DeGeneres prank.
[00:55:36.239 --> 00:55:38.841]  Matt Lauer grills Bill O'Reilly on sexual assault.
[00:55:38.841 --> 00:55:44.045]  It's all coming up as the chickens come home to roost.
[00:55:44.045 --> 00:55:46.887]  And then, I'm getting into the really serious news.
[00:55:46.887 --> 00:55:49.709]  That's North Korea, the new ICBM test.
[00:55:49.709 --> 00:55:58.516]  A lot of top military brass, as well as Senator Graham, who's on the Armed Services Committee and extremely powerful in that area, saying that it's moving towards total war.
[00:56:00.202 --> 00:56:04.383]  That's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, in the second hour.
[00:56:04.383 --> 00:56:08.964]  And I intend to open the phones up, and I intend to get more into Trump delivering again.
[00:56:08.964 --> 00:56:12.124]  3.3% growth rate in the economy.
[00:56:12.124 --> 00:56:15.125]  That gets some howling mad even more.
[00:56:15.125 --> 00:56:19.985]  Day of Reckoning, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai slams Silicon Valley for censoring conservatives.
[00:56:19.985 --> 00:56:21.466]  Finally, it's happening.
[00:56:21.466 --> 00:56:23.646]  Absolutely, they got antitrust problems.
[00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:25.246]  They're the ones talking about free open internet.
[00:56:25.246 --> 00:56:28.247]  They're the ones turning us into the Communist Chinese net system.
[00:56:29.758 --> 00:56:37.367]  They had it where the FCC would control all political thought, even online, if Hillary would have gotten elected, and Mr. Pai is reversing all that.
[00:56:37.367 --> 00:56:38.429]  He's a hero!
[00:56:38.429 --> 00:56:41.893]  Hip hip hooray for Mr. Pai!
[00:56:41.893 --> 00:56:42.414]  Amazing.
[00:56:43.359 --> 00:56:45.641]  Remember, it's an act of rebellion against their censorship.
[00:56:45.641 --> 00:56:46.401]  It's ongoing.
[00:56:46.401 --> 00:56:58.872]  When you spread the links, the live feeds on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com, Ford's last show, however you're watching right now, local stations, pull over at that red light, tell folks to tune into that local station, like our great Chicago affiliate, 1530.

[00:57:02.374 --> 00:57:04.516]  That's what is unstoppable.
[00:57:04.516 --> 00:57:05.197]  And don't forget,
[00:57:06.368 --> 00:57:12.754]  Funding us is allowing us to weather the attacks and grow in the face of the attacks and just checkmate the globalists.

[01:00:07.765 --> 01:00:19.609]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:28.352]  You know, I think it's better just to play these videos back to back to illustrate the hypocrisy of Matt Lauer being terminated.
[01:00:28.352 --> 01:00:32.653]  Charlie Rose, a lot more is coming.
[01:00:32.653 --> 01:00:34.614]  Hundreds of people have had to resign or been fired.
[01:00:36.058 --> 01:00:38.460]  And now just an accusation does it.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:48.227]  Both because they already know it's true, they've been sitting on it, but now this group of politicians, this group of media whores, have failed the globalists.
[01:00:48.227 --> 01:00:51.149]  You failed me for the last time, Lauer.
[01:00:51.149 --> 01:00:55.532]  And they're flushing them down the commode of history.
[01:00:55.532 --> 01:00:59.275]  The mercenaries failed, and now they're being blown out the airlock.
[01:00:59.275 --> 01:01:00.596]  Now let's play these clips back-to-back.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.842]  It's a sad morning here today and at NBC News.
[01:01:04.842 --> 01:01:09.405]  Just moments ago, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack sent the following note to our organization.
[01:01:09.405 --> 01:01:18.090]  Dear colleagues, on Monday night we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer.
[01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:23.094]  It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company's standards.
[01:01:23.094 --> 01:01:26.256]  As a result, we have decided to terminate his employment.
[01:01:26.256 --> 01:01:31.219]  While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he has been at NBC News,
[01:01:31.619 --> 01:01:36.920]  We were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:49.503]  Our highest priority is to create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected and to ensure that any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences no matter who the offender.
[01:01:49.503 --> 01:01:58.545]  We are deeply saddened by this turn of events but we will face it together as a news organization and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.
[01:01:59.225 --> 01:02:01.547]  That is the statement from our chairman, Andy Lapp.
[01:02:01.547 --> 01:02:05.070]  And we just learned this moments ago, just this morning.
[01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.312]  As I'm sure you can imagine, we are devastated.
[01:02:07.312 --> 01:02:10.134]  And we are still processing all of this.
[01:02:10.134 --> 01:02:14.697]  And I will tell you right now, we do not know more than what I just shared with you.
[01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:18.440]  But we will be covering this story as reporters, as journalists.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.123]  I'm sure we will be learning more details in the hours and days to come.
[01:02:22.123 --> 01:02:25.766]  And we promise we will share that with you.
[01:02:25.766 --> 01:02:26.387]  And Hoda, I mean...
[01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:30.793]  You know, for the moment, all we can say is that we are heartbroken.
[01:02:30.793 --> 01:02:32.894]  I'm heartbroken for Matt.
[01:02:32.894 --> 01:02:37.176]  He is my dear, dear friend and my partner, and he is beloved by many, many people here.
[01:02:37.176 --> 01:02:45.220]  And I'm heartbroken for the brave colleague who came forward to tell her story, and any other women who have their own stories to tell.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:51.943]  And we are grappling with a dilemma that so many people have faced these past few weeks.
[01:02:51.943 --> 01:02:58.186]  How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly?
[01:02:58.186 --> 01:03:00.107]  And I don't know the answer to that.
[01:03:00.107 --> 01:03:13.334]  But I do know that this reckoning that so many organizations have been going through is important, it's long overdue, and it must result in workplaces where all women, all people, feel safe and respected.
[01:03:14.514 --> 01:03:19.976]  As painful as it is this moment in our culture and this change, it had to happen.
[01:03:19.976 --> 01:03:22.517]  Every allegation in this area is a conviction.
[01:03:22.517 --> 01:03:23.338]  They don't look at the truth.
[01:03:23.338 --> 01:03:26.779]  But think about those five women and what they did.
[01:03:26.779 --> 01:03:33.202]  They came forward and filed complaints against the biggest star at the network they worked at.
[01:03:33.202 --> 01:03:37.684]  Think of how intimidating that must have been, how nerve-wracking that must have been.
[01:03:37.684 --> 01:03:41.125]  Doesn't that tell you how strongly they felt about the way they were treated by you?
[01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:42.106]  Well, it's not just me.
[01:03:43.246 --> 01:03:48.309]  Those lawsuits involve many other people, not just me.
[01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:57.035]  So, I don't know, I'm not going to speculate about intent or why people did what they did, but you don't have the story, Lauer, correct?
[01:03:57.035 --> 01:04:00.437]  The lawsuits involved many people.
[01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:00.938]  Many people.
[01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:01.978]  But you were also named.
[01:04:01.978 --> 01:04:04.040]  I was named in a few of them.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.122]  A few of them.
[01:04:06.122 --> 01:04:13.848]  Let me put a period on it this way, Bill, by asking you, over the last six months since your firing, have you done some soul-searching?
[01:04:13.848 --> 01:04:17.071]  Have you done some self-reflection?
[01:04:17.071 --> 01:04:23.317]  And have you looked at the way you treated women that you think now, or think about differently now than you did at the time?
[01:04:24.197 --> 01:04:25.738]  My conscience is clear.
[01:04:25.738 --> 01:04:32.063]  What I have done is organized a legal team to get the truth to the American people.
[01:04:32.063 --> 01:04:36.746]  So if you go to newsmatch.com... Alright folks, we're gonna go to break.
[01:04:36.746 --> 01:04:43.992]  Literally, they are engaged in night-of-the-long-knives, flushing their own people into the dustbin of history right now.
[01:04:43.992 --> 01:04:51.217]  Now the Prairie Home Companion radio host has been sacked over supposedly improper behavior.
[01:04:51.437 --> 01:04:52.597]  This is a purge.
[01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:55.278]  This is the globalists getting rid of all their prostitutes.
[01:04:55.278 --> 01:04:59.119]  It's pathetic.
[01:04:59.119 --> 01:05:02.239]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:05:02.239 --> 01:05:09.681]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[01:05:09.681 --> 01:05:15.262]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:05:16.022 --> 01:05:23.705]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:05:23.705 --> 01:05:31.568]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:05:32.308 --> 01:05:37.373]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:05:37.373 --> 01:05:39.515]  They are the anti-liberals.
[01:05:39.515 --> 01:05:52.906]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:52.906 --> 01:05:56.890]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:06:08.254 --> 01:06:13.098]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:06:13.098 --> 01:06:25.727]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.727 --> 01:06:34.353]  I'm gonna open the phones up for first-time callers again today, specifically on the hysteria going on in the country.
[01:06:36.072 --> 01:06:47.000]  Of individuals being accused with sexual harassment, sexual impropriety, staring many really guilty people, but also going after a lot of innocent people.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.483]  Why is the leftist globalist media suddenly so concerned about all this?
[01:06:52.483 --> 01:06:56.706]  Well, it's because their giant media combine isn't working.
[01:06:56.706 --> 01:07:01.890]  ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, NPR.
[01:07:04.022 --> 01:07:09.605]  They're flushing all the big name stars, because they're not stars.
[01:07:09.605 --> 01:07:29.953]  They're artificial celebrities created to sell globalism and to create illusions in the minds of weak-minded out there to buy into their so-called modernist, post-modernist, globalist worldview that's really just corporate slavery and complete emptiness.
[01:07:31.621 --> 01:07:36.305]  Garrison Keillor, is that how you pronounce him?
[01:07:36.305 --> 01:07:38.307]  I can't listen to his voice.
[01:07:38.307 --> 01:07:44.492]  Keillor, fired for alleged improper behavior by Minnesota Public Radio.
[01:07:44.492 --> 01:07:48.075]  Garrison Keillor, oh he's so fake.
[01:07:48.075 --> 01:07:49.937]  Hi, how you doing?
[01:07:49.937 --> 01:07:52.239]  The former host of a Prairie Home Companion.
[01:07:53.763 --> 01:07:57.184]  He says he's been fired by Minnesota Public Radio over allegations of improper behavior.
[01:07:57.184 --> 01:07:59.885]  Keillor told the Associated Press of his firing in an email.
[01:07:59.885 --> 01:08:09.849]  In a follow-up statement, he says he was fired over a story that I think is more interesting and more compelling than the version Minnesota Public Radio heard.
[01:08:09.849 --> 01:08:11.949]  He didn't give details of the allegation.
[01:08:11.949 --> 01:08:16.331]  Minnesota Public Radio didn't immediately respond to messages.
[01:08:16.331 --> 01:08:22.473]  Keillor retired last year from his longtime radio show, but he still produced the Writer's Almanac for syndication.
[01:08:24.497 --> 01:08:25.037]  There you go.
[01:08:25.037 --> 01:08:29.880]  Throw all the old Deadwood overboard.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:35.503]  And stop paying him royalties on airing his stupid Prairie Home Companion or whatever it is.
[01:08:35.503 --> 01:08:44.287]  The minute I hear that driving cross-country, sometimes you can tune into NPR and at least hear the propaganda, but you hear that and it's just like, oh, let me hit the button as fast as possible.
[01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:48.489]  I mean, if you want Alzheimer's, they say listening to that will give it to you in five minutes.
[01:08:48.489 --> 01:08:51.711]  I mean, if you want to die, listen to this guy.
[01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:52.691]  That's called satire.
[01:08:52.691 --> 01:08:53.432]  I'm not serious.
[01:08:54.653 --> 01:09:03.797]  Associated Press, Reuters, New York Times, Alex Jones says listening to Jerison Keillor will kill you!
[01:09:03.797 --> 01:09:05.657]  No, that's not what I was saying.
[01:09:05.657 --> 01:09:18.803]  So, this firestorm just intensifies and it's been reported in the LA Times and the New York Times that the police are now in both cities looking at sex trafficking and kidnapping for Harvey Weinstein.
[01:09:19.830 --> 01:09:28.476]  And boy, is his big cover-up using foreign intelligence agencies and police department people and detectives and folks threatening people.
[01:09:28.476 --> 01:09:30.797]  All the big house of cards is coming down.
[01:09:30.797 --> 01:09:34.360]  And once one big guy starts falling, they all start falling.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:38.683]  And all the other cowards run for the exits and can't wait to throw somebody under the bus.
[01:09:38.683 --> 01:09:40.264]  Why, he pinched my rear end once.
[01:09:40.264 --> 01:09:41.525]  Well, then execute him!
[01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:48.817]  But the real reason they're doing it is they're failures, they have no ratings, they're overrated, it's all over.
[01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:49.438]  And so now...
[01:09:50.711 --> 01:10:09.102]  They're just going to sue Donald Trump 3,000 times and sue me 100 times and sue everybody else and try to intimidate and sue your church if you've got a nativity scene out front or sue the city if they let kids hand out Christmas cards or sue the principal if he lets somebody in their commencement speech say I love God when it's your free speech, say whatever you want.
[01:10:09.102 --> 01:10:12.805]  Separation of church and state means we don't have a state-run religion called liberalism.
[01:10:13.405 --> 01:10:15.866]  Or Islam, or whatever you want to call it, state-run religion.
[01:10:15.866 --> 01:10:27.749]  Doesn't mean I can't get up there as the valedictorian, or the salutatorian, or as the captain of the football team, or the head of the drama team, and say, I love Jesus Christ!
[01:10:27.749 --> 01:10:42.133]  But it's all their intimidation, all their ignorance, all their fraud trying to manipulate us, and it's all coming to an end, because people are finally bucking them and saying, not just no, but absolutely no further, you shall not pass.
[01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:49.948]  He's the allegory of the Balrog coming across the chasm over the Stone Bridge.
[01:10:49.948 --> 01:10:53.250]  And you don't know how this is going to end, but you let him know.
[01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.771]  You shall not pass!
[01:10:55.771 --> 01:10:59.252]  You're going through us.
[01:10:59.252 --> 01:11:09.977]  And, of course, as allegories and clichés tend to be true, metaphysically, you tend to fall with your great nemesis.
[01:11:09.977 --> 01:11:11.218]  But through the fall,
[01:11:12.711 --> 01:11:14.432]  You ascend.
[01:11:14.432 --> 01:11:17.574]  Evil falls and is destroyed when it hits the bottom.
[01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:20.496]  When we fall, we rise even stronger.
[01:11:20.496 --> 01:11:22.457]  And that's the great animating contest.
[01:11:22.457 --> 01:11:36.767]  It's why anybody that really studies history, or studies the spiritual world, or studies just the way forces work in the universe, you should want to go through that fire, even though it's not going to be comfortable while you're doing it, like lifting weights or running a marathon.
[01:11:36.767 --> 01:11:38.328]  But if you fall,
[01:11:39.907 --> 01:11:44.050]  In combat with these people, you are risen up again.
[01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:52.356]  The example of Jesus Christ, physically risen, or Lazarus risen, as an archetypal example for us.
[01:11:52.356 --> 01:12:03.224]  But we are spiritually risen again, but also in life, everything is a reflection of the great final moment before God.
[01:12:03.224 --> 01:12:07.948]  And so you experience all this in little ways, as above, so below.
[01:12:13.789 --> 01:12:17.670]  Now, let me get into the really, really, really, really serious news.
[01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:20.090]  North Korea.
[01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:26.632]  You know, people say, oh, we're always hearing about missile tests, we're always hearing about Japanese boats being hijacked, or U.S.
[01:12:26.632 --> 01:12:35.634]  troops being taken hostage, and it's just kind of, you know, that's North Korea since 1953, July 27th, this has just been going on forever.
[01:12:35.634 --> 01:12:36.034]  And so,
[01:12:39.853 --> 01:12:41.415]  Alex, stop saying we're going to have nuclear war.
[01:12:41.415 --> 01:12:42.736]  Stop fear-mongering.
[01:12:42.736 --> 01:12:44.017]  I'm not fear-mongering.
[01:12:44.017 --> 01:12:52.647]  But when I go to sleep at night, one of the main things that I worry about for myself and my family is North Korea.
[01:12:52.647 --> 01:12:54.348]  The other thing is car wrecks.
[01:12:54.348 --> 01:13:00.074]  I know statistically car wrecks are the number one thing that will end up killing you or your children or maiming them.
[01:13:00.074 --> 01:13:01.296]  But I look at North Korea.
[01:13:02.375 --> 01:13:29.662]  And I look at, historically, how we're still at war with them, and I look at all the weapons they've got, and the fact that they've even broken away, to a great extent, from China, and the fact that they tested an ICBM, and that was successful, again, anywhere in the U.S., most areas in the world, and the fact that they're so arrogant, and so mentally ill, and that Kim Jong-un is killing a lot of his top generals and people just to keep them in line, and the starvation is increasing, and ghost boats are constantly floating up
[01:13:30.689 --> 01:13:34.731]  On the Japanese coast full of skeletons.
[01:13:34.731 --> 01:13:41.794]  Not even people that tried to escape to Japan.
[01:13:41.794 --> 01:13:45.156]  It's always eight people on board because that's what the military puts on as citizens.
[01:13:45.156 --> 01:13:47.257]  And they say, you got this little bitty sail.
[01:13:47.257 --> 01:13:53.260]  That's a third, you know, as big as it should be so you can't get away.
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:57.842]  And you got to go out until you bring back fish.
[01:13:57.842 --> 01:13:59.583]  A certain amount or we shoot you.
[01:14:01.161 --> 01:14:03.361]  And so they just lay out on the boat and say, well, why go back?
[01:14:03.361 --> 01:14:04.162]  They're just going to kill us.
[01:14:04.162 --> 01:14:05.682]  And they just die.
[01:14:05.682 --> 01:14:08.062]  Hundreds of these boats in the last decade wash up.
[01:14:08.062 --> 01:14:10.163]  A whole bunch of them just washed up this week.
[01:14:10.163 --> 01:14:12.863]  And they're just skeletons.
[01:14:12.863 --> 01:14:13.563]  Skeletons.
[01:14:13.563 --> 01:14:18.524]  It'll be eight men and eight, I mean, eight men or four men and four women.
[01:14:18.524 --> 01:14:21.765]  And they're just skeletons, just dead on these rotting ghost boats.
[01:14:21.765 --> 01:14:24.285]  You guys can search engine that if you want to show TV viewers.
[01:14:24.285 --> 01:14:27.866]  Ghost boats, ghost ships wash up on Japanese coast.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.441]  And like biological android robots, they just go out and die.
[01:14:33.441 --> 01:14:44.303]  Because you don't come back without the fish, and so, then you just die out at sea, and you just, you don't come back, and then, sometimes they think the boats are out there for four or five years, and they're just skeletons.
[01:14:44.303 --> 01:14:48.704]  They don't even run to Japan, because Japan just turns you around and sends you back.
[01:14:48.704 --> 01:14:49.524]  So there you go.
[01:14:49.524 --> 01:14:51.185]  I think they do deserve political amnesty.
[01:14:51.185 --> 01:14:53.525]  I, you know, if North Koreans were getting here, I'd say bring them in.
[01:14:53.525 --> 01:14:57.966]  If they actually have a real political asylum here, they're leaving hell on earth.
[01:15:00.643 --> 01:15:17.134]  But never does CNN say from the horrible communist regime ghost boats, or, oh, these new Islamic attacks were Islamic attacks, you know, the daily church being blown up, the mosque being blown up, it's just not radical enough, hundreds dead, shot, bombed every day, doesn't even hardly make our news, and never do they say it's an Islamic attack.
[01:15:17.134 --> 01:15:22.918]  And then Trump tweets out Islamic attacks, or admit Islamic attacks, and the news goes, who knows if these are even real?
[01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:25.700]  I mean, Muslims never kill anybody, okay?
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.221]  Did you hear the one Trump just said?
[01:15:27.221 --> 01:15:28.822]  He claimed Muslims blew something up.
[01:15:30.182 --> 01:15:31.744]  Oh, that's a really good one!
[01:15:31.744 --> 01:15:34.946]  Next, pigs can fly!
[01:15:34.946 --> 01:15:38.768]  Why do the Muslims cross the road to blow up the church?
[01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:43.391]  Why do Muslims cross back over the road to load their kid up and apply the explosives?
[01:15:43.391 --> 01:15:47.914]  Why do they walk back across the road to have their kid walk into a school and blow up people?
[01:15:47.914 --> 01:15:53.038]  Why do they walk back across the road to rape their wife and cut their newborn daughter's genitals off?
[01:15:53.038 --> 01:15:54.279]  We'll be right back with North Korea.
[01:15:57.483 --> 01:16:04.005]  KD Armor has been on a mission to manufacture the most comfortable body armor on the market, and we've succeeded.

[01:17:28.856 --> 01:17:30.637]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:17:30.637 --> 01:17:32.298]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:17:32.298 --> 01:17:35.120]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.401]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:41.924]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:17:58.362 --> 01:18:02.884]  YouTube has a huge pedophile problem, and advertisers are starting to take note.
[01:18:02.884 --> 01:18:12.529]  YouTube is guilty of not removing content that promotes terrorism and extremism, and it was recently hit for not removing violent content from its YouTube Kids platform.
[01:18:12.529 --> 01:18:16.171]  Now YouTube is under fire for ignoring its own pedophile problem.
[01:18:16.371 --> 01:18:27.218]  A recent BuzzFeed report describes a vast, disturbing, and wildly popular universe of videos that include live action footage of children depicted in compromising situations.
[01:18:27.218 --> 01:18:37.986]  Big companies are now pulling advertising from YouTube after it was revealed that up to 100,000 predatory accounts have been leaving indecent comments on videos featuring children for at least a year.
[01:18:38.226 --> 01:18:47.837]  That's right, while the Google-owned platform has been censoring and demonetizing offensive political content for the last six months, pedophiles were completely left alone.
[01:18:47.837 --> 01:18:55.906]  Maybe YouTube should concentrate on cleaning its own house before declaring completely legitimate political content to be harmful or disturbing.
[01:18:55.906 --> 01:18:57.728]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[01:18:58.268 --> 01:19:09.732]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[01:19:09.732 --> 01:19:17.234]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[01:19:17.234 --> 01:19:27.137]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[01:19:27.597 --> 01:19:32.619]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife everyday maintenance.
[01:19:32.619 --> 01:19:42.904]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:49.527]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price when you purchase it.
[01:19:49.747 --> 01:19:51.148]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:35.202]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:35.202 --> 01:20:48.133]  By the way, coming up in the next segment, President Trump has called for an investigation into Joe Scarborough and the mysterious death that took place at his office in Florida of his intern.
[01:20:49.699 --> 01:20:56.647]  And Trump has also called for the investigation of the chairman of NBC for his sexual activities.
[01:20:56.647 --> 01:21:02.895]  And as I've said, they're burning Matt Lauer, they're, you know, they're burning all these other people because they don't get ratings, they're not successful.
[01:21:02.895 --> 01:21:05.238]  They've been covering it all up for a long time.
[01:21:06.803 --> 01:21:08.004]  We're going to get to that coming up.
[01:21:08.004 --> 01:21:13.288]  Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.
[01:21:13.288 --> 01:21:19.313]  But when will the top executives at NBC and Comcast be fired for putting out so much fake news?
[01:21:19.313 --> 01:21:23.116]  Check out Andy Lack's past.
[01:21:23.116 --> 01:21:25.138]  You want to fight?
[01:21:25.138 --> 01:21:26.779]  You Globos are going to get one.
[01:21:26.779 --> 01:21:28.781]  And you're going to get my special attention.
[01:21:28.781 --> 01:21:31.443]  I can't wait.
[01:21:31.443 --> 01:21:35.707]  I've gone from being on the fence about this stuff to just right now I'm just like a
[01:21:36.747 --> 01:21:39.708]  Wild boar ready to go wild.
[01:21:39.708 --> 01:21:44.349]  My tusker is ready to gouge politically.
[01:21:44.349 --> 01:21:47.750]  There's nothing like the battle fury and you can feel it.
[01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:50.231]  The enemy's about to move on everybody in the next month.
[01:21:50.231 --> 01:21:52.351]  They've already been moving, but they're about to move.
[01:21:52.351 --> 01:21:56.112]  And once we beat this attack, we're going to win.
[01:21:56.112 --> 01:22:00.413]  But there are other big problems that we're facing.
[01:22:00.413 --> 01:22:02.414]  And that's North Korea that I was just getting into.
[01:22:04.423 --> 01:22:10.406]  Mattis, North Korea's new ICBM can hit targets nearly anywhere in the world.
[01:22:10.406 --> 01:22:14.789]  Also, Graham on North Korea, and I don't like to agree with Senator Graham on a lot of stuff, but he's right.
[01:22:14.789 --> 01:22:18.491]  We're headed to war if things don't change.
[01:22:18.491 --> 01:22:20.432]  This is a big, big deal.
[01:22:20.432 --> 01:22:23.373]  North Korea launches ICBM in the Pacific Ocean.
[01:22:23.373 --> 01:22:24.514]  It went higher and further.
[01:22:25.771 --> 01:22:28.193]  Of any, they can track the trajectory.
[01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:37.438]  If they were to let it continue on, it could hit anywhere in North America, probably anywhere in the world, as Secretary of Defense Mattis talked about.
[01:22:37.438 --> 01:22:42.882]  So right now, let's play that clip of Secretary of Defense Mattis.
[01:22:42.882 --> 01:22:47.324]  North Korean missile launch went higher than previous test.
[01:22:47.324 --> 01:22:49.366]  And it takes it to a whole new level.
[01:22:49.366 --> 01:22:49.646]  Here it is.
[01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:58.904]  Mr. President, Senator, Speaker, a little over two and a half hours ago, North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile.
[01:22:58.904 --> 01:23:03.765]  It went higher, frankly, than any previous shots they've taken.
[01:23:03.765 --> 01:23:12.128]  It's a research and development effort on their part to continue building ballistic missiles that could threaten everywhere in the world, basically.
[01:23:13.108 --> 01:23:25.317]  And in response, the South Koreans have fired some pinpoint missiles out into the water to make certain North Korea understands that they could be taken under fire by our ally.
[01:23:25.317 --> 01:23:35.505]  But the bottom line is it's a continued effort to build a threat, sir, a ballistic missile threat that endangers world peace, regional peace, and certainly the United States.
[01:23:42.119 --> 01:23:47.584]  State Department comments on North Korea's latest missile launch.
[01:23:47.584 --> 01:23:48.704]  Here it is.
[01:23:48.704 --> 01:23:54.869]  The DPRK missile launch and the Secretary would like to release this statement right now.
[01:23:54.869 --> 01:23:57.452]  And then I'd be happy to take your questions.
[01:23:57.452 --> 01:23:57.752]  Yes it is.
[01:24:00.478 --> 01:24:11.384]  The United States strongly condemns North Korea's launch of what was likely an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan, indiscriminately threatening its neighbors, the region, and global stability.
[01:24:11.384 --> 01:24:16.947]  The DPRK's relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them must be reversed.
[01:24:16.947 --> 01:24:25.632]  Together, the international community must continue to send a unified message to North Korea that the DPRK must abandon its weapons of mass destruction programs.
[01:24:26.232 --> 01:24:30.693]  All nations must continue strong economic and diplomatic measures.
[01:24:30.693 --> 01:24:45.238]  In addition to implementing all existing UN sanctions, the international community must take additional measures to enhance maritime security, including the right to interdict maritime traffic transporting goods to and from the DPRK.
[01:24:45.238 --> 01:24:53.941]  The United States, in partnership with Canada, will now convene a meeting of the United Nations Command Sending States to include the Republic of Korea and Japan
[01:24:54.521 --> 01:24:56.723]  Now, I published a big article by Ron Paul yesterday on Infowars.com
[01:25:21.328 --> 01:25:27.056]  Calling for backing down from North Korea and pointing out that our sanctions mainly just hurt their people.
[01:25:27.056 --> 01:25:29.359]  And I showed that because this is a complex issue.
[01:25:29.359 --> 01:25:34.866]  I agree with Ron Paul to a great extent.
[01:25:34.866 --> 01:25:37.529]  But North Korea has broken all its previous deals.
[01:25:39.016 --> 01:25:46.843]  is menacing its neighbors and it could just let its people have a little bit of economic freedom and they'd be like South Korea, one of the wealthiest countries on earth.
[01:25:46.843 --> 01:25:47.684]  It's the same people.
[01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:53.790]  They're smart, they're hardworking, they're focused, they're great mathematicians, the list goes on and on.
[01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:58.795]  And they are under a suffocating evil regime of a little demonic inbred
[01:26:00.196 --> 01:26:09.923]  Third-generation dictator who is threatening everybody and who is starting fights and who is kidnapping people from Japan and China and the US and all of this.
[01:26:09.923 --> 01:26:12.724]  It's out of control!
[01:26:12.724 --> 01:26:13.905]  Trump didn't start this.
[01:26:13.905 --> 01:26:16.347]  We didn't start this.
[01:26:16.347 --> 01:26:21.130]  The Communist Chinese invaded Korea.
[01:26:21.130 --> 01:26:22.291]  And that's where all this came from.
[01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:30.175]  And we're still at war with them, and this is one of the biggest trigger points in the world right now, and it's a very serious situation.
[01:26:30.175 --> 01:26:44.625]  And people out there that say it isn't, just because this has been going on since 1950, and we've had a ceasefire since 53, it's coming to a head.
[01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:48.028]  And you hear the statements, in fact we have the statement from Graham,
[01:26:49.462 --> 01:26:50.022]  I don't know if I forgot.
[01:26:50.022 --> 01:26:55.507]  Now let's play, this is Senator Lindsey Graham talking about how this is going to war.
[01:26:55.507 --> 01:27:00.371]  And that's the military's been told, anytime, get ready.
[01:27:00.371 --> 01:27:02.672]  And they basically have South Korean and U.S.
[01:27:02.672 --> 01:27:04.414]  military that have agreed to suicide missions.
[01:27:04.414 --> 01:27:06.936]  This is not a secret, by the way, North Korea knows this.
[01:27:06.936 --> 01:27:09.978]  We have military and others that have agreed to suicide missions.
[01:27:09.978 --> 01:27:13.341]  That means more than a 50% likelihood you won't make it out to go in and kill him.
[01:27:15.293 --> 01:27:21.397]  So, Trump is really, I think, just changing course because the other course hasn't worked.
[01:27:21.397 --> 01:27:23.938]  Ron Paul says, are they really a sponsor of terror?
[01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:25.959]  And he says they aren't.
[01:27:25.959 --> 01:27:28.521]  And then he gives the reasons why we shouldn't go to war with them and why it's bad.
[01:27:28.521 --> 01:27:30.342]  No, they are sponsors of terror in the Middle East.
[01:27:30.342 --> 01:27:31.482]  They've been caught doing it.
[01:27:31.482 --> 01:27:35.945]  But I understand we shouldn't escalate this, but they shouldn't either.
[01:27:35.945 --> 01:27:37.025]  It's a two-way street.
[01:27:37.025 --> 01:27:37.746]  Here's Senator Graham.
[01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:47.936]  Does this latest intercontinental ballistic missile test bring North Korea to actually threatening the United States with a nuclear-tipped ICBM?
[01:27:47.936 --> 01:27:52.959]  I'll let the intelligence community give you that answer, but I believe every test puts them closer.
[01:27:52.959 --> 01:27:55.160]  And the President has said, we'll take care of it.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.322]  Not the United Nations, not China, we'll take care of it.
[01:27:58.322 --> 01:28:00.864]  And my hope is that North Korea will realize that
[01:28:01.084 --> 01:28:01.344]  Yeah.
[01:28:01.344 --> 01:28:01.504]  Yeah.
[01:28:31.805 --> 01:28:33.646]  This war could lead to millions of casualties.
[01:28:33.646 --> 01:28:35.748]  It probably will.
[01:28:35.748 --> 01:28:37.069]  And it's a serious issue.
[01:28:37.069 --> 01:28:41.352]  When we come back, I'm going to get into some good news straight ahead.
[01:28:41.352 --> 01:28:47.917]  Very exciting things happening with the new FCC chairman standing up to Google, Facebook, and Twitter and saying, look, you guys act like communist Chinese.
[01:28:47.917 --> 01:28:49.578]  Knock it off right now.
[01:28:49.578 --> 01:28:50.599]  And we got Scarborough.
[01:28:50.599 --> 01:28:54.222]  Trump wants him investigated for the mystery that happened down there at his office.
[01:28:57.423 --> 01:28:58.323]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:58.323 --> 01:29:00.705]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:00.705 --> 01:29:08.748]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[01:29:27.199 --> 01:29:32.303]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.

[01:29:51.776 --> 01:29:53.737]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:29:53.737 --> 01:29:55.558]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:29:58.291 --> 01:30:08.960]  President Trump once again called Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas, and now the establishment media says that Trump insulted her Native American heritage when he used the racial slur.
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:12.162]  Fact check, Elizabeth Warren is not Native American.
[01:30:12.162 --> 01:30:21.110]  There is zero evidence that Warren is Cherokee, yet she's claimed for years that it's part of her family folklore and that her pawpaw had high cheekbones.
[01:30:21.710 --> 01:30:26.353]  Warren didn't self-identify as Native American until she was 38 years old.
[01:30:26.353 --> 01:30:30.976]  She claimed that minority status for years in order to climb the academic ladder.
[01:30:30.976 --> 01:30:40.642]  And this false information wasn't something she just claimed as a student, but Warren began putting it in her professional bios for years when law schools were hungry for minority faculty.
[01:30:40.962 --> 01:30:47.328]  Foca Hontas lied about being Native American in order to gain an unfair advantage in securing academic tenure.
[01:30:47.328 --> 01:30:54.434]  This means she actually stole that position from a real Native American who could have benefited from their minority status.
[01:30:54.434 --> 01:30:55.795]  Racist!
[01:30:55.795 --> 01:30:57.697]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com

[01:33:32.613 --> 01:33:34.059]  The Hammer of the Gods!
[01:33:36.553 --> 01:33:38.294]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:38.294 --> 01:33:39.734]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.734 --> 01:33:42.655]  This is the InfoWarb.
[01:33:42.655 --> 01:33:46.777]  Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:33:46.777 --> 01:33:50.258]  The globals are doing everything they can to try to keep people from visiting those sites.
[01:33:50.258 --> 01:33:52.339]  Let me give the number out to take your calls.
[01:33:52.339 --> 01:33:52.939]  It's 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:33:52.939 --> 01:33:54.440]  We're doing first-time callers.
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:58.041]  I want to get your take on North Korea, on Matt Lauer, on the purges, on all of it.
[01:34:05.282 --> 01:34:07.642]  There's also a report I want to get into here.
[01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:12.663]  Trump says investigate Scarborough over death of intern.
[01:34:12.663 --> 01:34:17.144]  I'm not saying Scarborough killed his intern, a young female.
[01:34:17.144 --> 01:34:19.345]  But it was always a mystery what happened.
[01:34:19.345 --> 01:34:23.505]  And the president has a lot of information, a lot of sources.
[01:34:23.505 --> 01:34:25.866]  And he has been tweeting about that.
[01:34:25.866 --> 01:34:28.766]  Kit Daniels' article is on Infowars.com.
[01:34:28.766 --> 01:34:33.087]  President sheds light on unusual circumstances of intern's death.
[01:34:34.738 --> 01:34:41.301]  He also says investigate the chairman of NBC for his personal activities.
[01:34:41.301 --> 01:34:46.824]  Yeah, let's not just burn Brian Williams for fake news and Matt Lauer for bad ratings.
[01:34:46.824 --> 01:34:50.225]  I mean, we're not saying what he did was okay, if it's even true.
[01:34:50.225 --> 01:34:51.926]  We're saying we know what you're doing.
[01:34:51.926 --> 01:35:00.070]  More NPR firings, not just Prairie Home Companion guys been fired, but now there are a bunch of other editors and people being fired over sexual harassment.
[01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:02.131]  Of course, they've known about all this forever.
[01:35:03.063 --> 01:35:05.845]  Katie Couric said Matt Lauer used to pinch her rear end.
[01:35:05.845 --> 01:35:17.295]  She used a different word for that, but the point is, is that now they're going to use all that to get rid of all the bloat, all the dead wood.
[01:35:17.295 --> 01:35:20.318]  Time Magazine just laid off 50% of its employees, or Time Inc.
[01:35:20.318 --> 01:35:21.599]  They're imploding!
[01:35:21.599 --> 01:35:24.101]  They're a joke!
[01:35:24.101 --> 01:35:25.843]  And out of time and Newsweek respond, they say,
[01:35:27.415 --> 01:35:29.597]  Alex Jones says no one was killed in Vegas.
[01:35:29.597 --> 01:35:30.918]  Total lie.
[01:35:30.918 --> 01:35:32.239]  Total lie.
[01:35:32.239 --> 01:35:33.740]  Total lie.
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:36.162]  And that I think there's slave colonies of Martians.
[01:35:36.162 --> 01:35:37.123]  Never said it.
[01:35:37.123 --> 01:35:37.883]  No video.
[01:35:37.883 --> 01:35:38.544]  No audio.
[01:35:38.544 --> 01:35:39.485]  No text.
[01:35:39.485 --> 01:35:40.305]  Lies.
[01:35:40.305 --> 01:35:41.046]  Lies.
[01:35:41.046 --> 01:35:42.587]  Jones believes in the Loch Ness Monster.
[01:35:42.587 --> 01:35:43.948]  Jones believes in blah blah blah.
[01:35:43.948 --> 01:35:44.649]  You see everywhere.
[01:35:44.649 --> 01:35:45.970]  He believes in Bigfoot.
[01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:47.591]  That's the guy that covers Bigfoot.
[01:35:47.591 --> 01:35:53.256]  They think you're so dumb they go, oh that's the guy that covers Bigfoot.
[01:35:53.256 --> 01:35:54.737]  Uh, no I'm the one with the sources.
[01:35:56.576 --> 01:36:04.658]  So much that just keeps sending us info, but I mean, a lot of people say, why didn't you do something with this or do something with that?
[01:36:04.658 --> 01:36:10.699]  And, you know, quite frankly, I'm not just here to break big stories.
[01:36:10.699 --> 01:36:14.200]  I'm here to break the big stories that actually have attacked the globalists and exposed their system.
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:20.561]  I don't hold back on stories, but, you know, gay orgies on Air Force One.
[01:36:20.561 --> 01:36:24.062]  I mean, I mean, you can just feel
[01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:27.811]  You're asking to get killed with that story.
[01:36:27.811 --> 01:36:31.131]  And I told the reporters that have it, I just said, why don't you just release that?
[01:36:31.131 --> 01:36:32.912]  And it's not like I'm even afraid of it.
[01:36:32.912 --> 01:36:37.953]  It's like I got like a spider sensor, just at a certain point, like I'm willing to risk my life to do it all the time.
[01:36:37.953 --> 01:36:41.314]  But it's just like consenting adults.
[01:36:41.314 --> 01:36:43.574]  But it also gets into the blackmail.
[01:36:43.574 --> 01:36:46.675]  It also gets into the control, you know.
[01:36:46.675 --> 01:36:47.535]  It's all going to come out.
[01:36:47.535 --> 01:36:50.896]  Gay sex in the motorcade.
[01:36:50.896 --> 01:36:51.836]  Certain well-known actor.
[01:36:55.851 --> 01:36:58.211]  Bill Clinton rolling down the window going, you having fun back there?
[01:36:58.211 --> 01:37:01.792]  I like girls, but boy, you do a good job at that.
[01:37:01.792 --> 01:37:06.353]  Maybe I'll let you do that to me.
[01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:08.973]  But see, I don't have to release it.
[01:37:08.973 --> 01:37:11.494]  Other people are.
[01:37:11.494 --> 01:37:15.274]  But you better know my phones are tapped.
[01:37:15.274 --> 01:37:17.595]  And you better know they're mad at me.
[01:37:17.595 --> 01:37:21.476]  And so all I'm asking listeners is to think about that and understand that and pray for us.
[01:37:21.476 --> 01:37:23.376]  Because that'll give us the
[01:37:25.512 --> 01:37:30.695]  Discernment and the provisions we need spiritually, mentally, financially, you name it, to go through this.
[01:37:30.695 --> 01:37:37.598]  Because we are at the center of this and the enemy knows it and they've got to worry every minute what we're about to release, what we're about to say, what we're about to do.
[01:37:37.598 --> 01:37:38.458]  But I feel better.
[01:37:38.458 --> 01:37:39.639]  I feel safer.
[01:37:39.639 --> 01:37:40.719]  Because, you know, I want to feel safe.
[01:37:40.719 --> 01:37:44.581]  I'll risk my life if I have to, but I don't want to be the tip of the spear all the time.
[01:37:44.581 --> 01:37:53.906]  And so it feels so good to see all these other prominent people out there that are telling the truth and taking action and doing all these things because
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:02.563]  I know we're all safer as more of us stand up, as more of us do the right thing.
[01:38:02.563 --> 01:38:04.484]  The Mark Twain quote comes to mind.
[01:38:04.484 --> 01:38:09.247]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man hated, feared, and scorned.
[01:38:09.247 --> 01:38:15.651]  But in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:38:15.651 --> 01:38:20.534]  So I'm going to hit this amazingly positive news and take some of your phone calls coming up here in the next segment, 877-789-2539.
[01:38:20.534 --> 01:38:22.415]  And get into the FCC chairman, but just briefly,
[01:38:30.492 --> 01:38:36.772]  We are going to have to end, well some of these specials have already ended, four or five of the items, because they sold out.
[01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:40.711]  Like Winter Sun, Caveman, and others.
[01:38:40.711 --> 01:38:44.352]  But Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, highest quality, 67% off.
[01:38:44.352 --> 01:38:45.112]  Nobody does that.
[01:38:45.112 --> 01:38:47.213]  That's the main thing you see sold in Whole Foods.
[01:38:47.213 --> 01:38:47.993]  It's the highest quality.
[01:38:47.993 --> 01:38:49.633]  Bezos sells it for $19 to $25.
[01:38:49.633 --> 01:38:51.774]  We sell it for normally $15.
[01:38:51.774 --> 01:38:53.114]  It's a great deal.
[01:38:53.114 --> 01:38:54.995]  At $9.95, which is unprecedented.
[01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:58.916]  Brain Force Plus, the amazing Nootropic, 50% off, and free shipping on all these items.
[01:38:58.916 --> 01:39:02.817]  Survival Shield X2, the amazing good halogen, the opposite of fluoride, that's 50% off.
[01:39:03.777 --> 01:39:05.378]  Super Mel Vitality, 50% off.
[01:39:05.378 --> 01:39:08.020]  Knockout Sleep Aid, so amazing, 50% off.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.801]  All Pro-Pure items, 25% off.
[01:39:09.801 --> 01:39:14.223]  Plus many other items at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:39:14.223 --> 01:39:18.186]  And you can also call toll-free and ask about all the specials, 888-253-3139.
[01:39:18.186 --> 01:39:28.172]  And until 5 o'clock every day, our crew at the warehouse building, that's different than the broadcast building, that's in a different area of Austin, they
[01:39:29.867 --> 01:39:32.809]  Take the orders, answer your questions, and are awesome folks.
[01:39:32.809 --> 01:39:35.712]  We have an answering service we've had for 20 years that takes your orders after that.
[01:39:35.712 --> 01:39:36.813]  They do a pretty good job.
[01:39:36.813 --> 01:39:43.878]  They just can't tell you all about the New World Order, or what color socks I wore today, or what color shoes or whatever.
[01:39:43.878 --> 01:39:45.840]  They're not here with us, but it's here in Austin.
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:47.741]  And it's a good outfit.
[01:39:47.741 --> 01:39:52.645]  So 24 hours a day you can call and get your questions answered about items or about products.
[01:39:52.645 --> 01:39:57.428]  They can't ask you about the status of an order or things like that because it's an order service doing it after 5.
[01:39:57.428 --> 01:40:04.173]  But they can do that during the day here with the Santa's little helpers we have across town here.
[01:40:04.173 --> 01:40:07.496]  Also, we've got free shipping again as I said.
[01:40:07.496 --> 01:40:08.937]  Sign up for auto ship an additional 10% off.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:32.928]  And then that locks in the low price of the sale at the time and an additional 10% off in perpetuity because even if something's sold out, we hold back for everybody that has auto ship back there in the warehouse of the pallets so that you never don't get your brain forced or get your the real red pill or other great systems that we have at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:40:32.928 --> 01:40:33.909]  And again, it is an active
[01:40:35.236 --> 01:40:40.080]  Buying war bonds, an act of resisting the enemy to support us and buy the great products.
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:43.062]  So again, thank you all for what you do.
[01:40:43.062 --> 01:40:48.966]  Okay, here's the report that's up on NewsWars.com and PresidentPlanet.com.
[01:40:48.966 --> 01:40:53.630]  Trump says investigates Scarborough over death of intern.
[01:40:53.630 --> 01:40:58.433]  President sheds light on unusual circumstances of intern's death.
[01:40:58.433 --> 01:41:00.615]  In response, and of course he's also called him psycho,
[01:41:01.877 --> 01:41:20.821]  Joe, in response to Matt Lauer's revelations, President Trump said MSNBC host Joe Scarborough should also be investigated for the unsolved mystery, close quote, likely referring to the death of intern Lori Clawsuits in 2001.
[01:41:20.821 --> 01:41:24.662]  He left Congress after that and started working for MSNBC.
[01:41:24.662 --> 01:41:28.063]  Went from being a conservative to an establishment man.
[01:41:29.548 --> 01:41:33.450]  And hey, what was the alternative?
[01:41:33.450 --> 01:41:39.593]  And will they terminate low ratings of Scarborough based on the unsolved mystery that took place in Florida years ago?
[01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:43.975]  Investigate, tweeted the president on Wednesday morning.
[01:41:43.975 --> 01:41:52.960]  How incredibly awesome and just fabulous is it to have somebody who's taken the gloves off and who's put brass knuckles on?
[01:41:54.008 --> 01:41:59.732]  And he says investigate the chairman of NBC for his activity with women and others.
[01:41:59.732 --> 01:42:00.433]  You see?
[01:42:00.433 --> 01:42:01.854]  Oh, you want to kill the president?
[01:42:01.854 --> 01:42:02.994]  You want to overthrow it?
[01:42:02.994 --> 01:42:03.875]  You want to get me?
[01:42:03.875 --> 01:42:05.056]  You want to put me in prison?
[01:42:05.056 --> 01:42:09.459]  They got MSNBC hosts saying, you know, lock up all the conservatives, lock up the Trump people.
[01:42:09.459 --> 01:42:11.901]  Once we get power, we're going to put you all in prison.
[01:42:11.901 --> 01:42:13.261]  Hey, we understand that!
[01:42:13.261 --> 01:42:15.803]  Can we queue that guy up?
[01:42:15.803 --> 01:42:18.365]  We understand where you're going, what you're doing.
[01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:19.486]  We understand your mission.
[01:42:19.486 --> 01:42:20.887]  We got it!
[01:42:20.887 --> 01:42:22.248]  We got you're not giving us quarter.
[01:42:23.496 --> 01:42:25.819]  None offered, none given back.
[01:42:25.819 --> 01:42:26.781]  We got it.
[01:42:26.781 --> 01:42:27.702]  You wanna bang heads?
[01:42:28.831 --> 01:42:30.471]  You wanna bang heads?
[01:42:30.471 --> 01:42:31.052]  Boom, baby.
[01:42:31.052 --> 01:42:32.412]  Boom.
[01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:33.552]  It's gonna happen.
[01:42:33.552 --> 01:42:34.653]  Okay.
[01:42:34.653 --> 01:42:37.414]  I'm gonna get into pie after I take some of your phone calls.
[01:42:37.414 --> 01:42:39.214]  I don't mean pumpkin pie.
[01:42:39.214 --> 01:42:45.396]  Day of Reckoning, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, what an incredible individual, slammed Silicon Valley for centrist conservatives.
[01:42:45.396 --> 01:42:47.937]  I just wanna say I'm so thankful to Trump.
[01:42:47.937 --> 01:42:48.917]  This is so good.
[01:42:48.917 --> 01:42:50.137]  This is so right.
[01:42:50.137 --> 01:42:51.538]  This is so amazing.
[01:42:51.538 --> 01:42:53.678]  This is just fulfilling the promises.
[01:42:53.678 --> 01:42:54.239]  Wow.
[01:42:54.239 --> 01:42:54.779]  Wow.
[01:42:54.779 --> 01:42:55.259]  Wow.
[01:42:55.259 --> 01:42:55.439]  Wow.
[01:42:57.699 --> 01:43:05.161]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:43:05.161 --> 01:43:18.364]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:43:57.699 --> 01:43:58.500]  I'm so excited.
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:08.646]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:44:08.646 --> 01:44:14.150]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulus in it.
[01:44:14.150 --> 01:44:17.152]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:44:17.152 --> 01:44:25.958]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:44:28.039 --> 01:44:33.340]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:36.241]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:44:36.241 --> 01:44:47.624]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:47.624 --> 01:44:50.305]  It is amazing!

[01:45:09.963 --> 01:45:15.467]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:45:15.467 --> 01:45:18.489]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:45:18.489 --> 01:45:27.275]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:45:29.356 --> 01:45:48.951]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.

[01:47:24.491 --> 01:47:27.433]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:27.433 --> 01:47:28.975]  Or InfoWars Live as I call it.
[01:47:28.975 --> 01:47:30.296]  I'm your host.
[01:47:30.296 --> 01:47:34.199]  Owen Schroer is coming up at 3 o'clock Central today.
[01:47:34.199 --> 01:47:36.500]  With The War Room and of course David Knight.
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:37.521]  With The David Knight Show.
[01:47:37.521 --> 01:47:39.883]  You can call it The Real News, whatever.
[01:47:39.883 --> 01:47:42.225]  The point is, it's David Knight.
[01:47:42.225 --> 01:47:44.667]  And doing a great job with all the stuff he breaks down.
[01:47:44.667 --> 01:47:50.711]  And all of these broadcasts on radio and TV simulcast are tomorrow's news today.
[01:47:50.711 --> 01:47:51.412]  On so many
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.982]  Because we're not just buying the official story.
[01:47:55.982 --> 01:48:03.406]  We know the long-term narrative of where we've come from, where we are, and where we're going.
[01:48:03.406 --> 01:48:13.672]  And what the globalists actually say in their industry publications, in their conferences, and in their white papers, that is academic and corporate, but not secret.
[01:48:16.138 --> 01:48:28.309]  We had Ted Malik on who used to be the main board member of the Davos Group from its beginning until he left it saying it's dead and it's a joke and it's anti-American and it's authoritarian.
[01:48:28.309 --> 01:48:33.194]  That guy's the Aspen Institute, Council on Foreign Relations, he knows them all.
[01:48:33.194 --> 01:48:36.737]  The world leaders, you name it.
[01:48:36.737 --> 01:48:40.561]  And now for a decade he's been quietly dynamiting things on the inside.
[01:48:42.671 --> 01:48:45.413]  He's working with Nigel Farage and UKIP and all the rest of it.
[01:48:45.413 --> 01:48:48.115]  This is a real resistance.
[01:48:48.115 --> 01:48:51.257]  But we're going to be attacked back.
[01:48:51.257 --> 01:48:57.881]  Okay, right now, I should go ahead and go to some of your phone calls here.
[01:48:57.881 --> 01:48:59.142]  Who is up first?
[01:48:59.142 --> 01:49:09.389]  We got Fred and Joe and Dan and Nate and Colt and Christian and Aaron and Mike and Dr. Colette and just so many others.
[01:49:09.389 --> 01:49:12.291]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:49:13.578 --> 01:49:15.299]  Let's go to Fred in Wisconsin.
[01:49:15.299 --> 01:49:18.520]  You're on the air, Fred.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:21.861]  Hey Alex, you know, I fed to your call screener a little bit.
[01:49:21.861 --> 01:49:23.361]  I don't want to talk about North Korea.
[01:49:23.361 --> 01:49:25.882]  I'm calling in because I disagree with you.
[01:49:25.882 --> 01:49:28.283]  I disagree with you entirely on net neutrality.
[01:49:28.283 --> 01:49:30.524]  I want to know if you have the cojones to debate me.
[01:49:30.524 --> 01:49:32.205]  I've been on your show before.
[01:49:32.205 --> 01:49:36.006]  I'm the SOPA, TIPA protester back in the GoDaddy days.
[01:49:37.105 --> 01:49:38.946]  And I don't know why you're on the wrong side of this Alex.
[01:49:38.946 --> 01:49:39.666]  I don't know why.
[01:49:57.233 --> 01:50:22.503]  The FCC taking control of free speech, the Federal Trade Commission and others calling for my arrest, saying ban conservative and libertarian news and ban the Drudge Report, including Infowars, and they had hearings admitting they're trying to do it, and Google, Facebook and Twitter are all massively censoring right now, and Ajay Pai, the new head of the FCC said, you people are censoring under the name net neutrality, bringing government power in to control free speech.
[01:50:22.503 --> 01:50:23.544]  This is bull!
[01:50:23.544 --> 01:50:26.105]  We're going back to the net neutrality we had previously!
[01:50:26.445 --> 01:50:28.106]  And I've read all the different proposals.
[01:50:28.106 --> 01:50:37.770]  It doesn't mean there aren't lobbyists on all sides with big telecoms trying to get a leg up on Google, Facebook, and Twitter, who've been given a monopoly over the Internet.
[01:50:37.770 --> 01:50:45.013]  Now Facebook, Twitter, and Google are trying to keep the big telecoms like AT&T and Time Warner out of that.
[01:50:45.013 --> 01:50:46.713]  So I'm not lionizing any of the groups.
[01:50:46.713 --> 01:50:49.034]  I've actually studied all the angles.
[01:50:49.034 --> 01:50:55.377]  And so what Obama called net neutrality is not net neutrality and has been absolutely anti-free speech.
[01:50:58.191 --> 01:50:59.052]  Okay, I'm going to let you go.
[01:50:59.052 --> 01:50:59.893]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:59.893 --> 01:51:08.962]  Fred, I'm not going to play these games, these semantical games, where you don't ever respond to me, you talk about how I don't have the nerve to talk to you, and then you sit there and act like you don't hear me.
[01:51:08.962 --> 01:51:11.585]  Not going to play third grade games, bro!
[01:51:11.585 --> 01:51:11.825]  Got it?
[01:51:11.825 --> 01:51:16.350]  I'm going to read what Ajay Pai breaks down here.
[01:51:16.350 --> 01:51:19.213]  I've experienced Soviet-level censorship.
[01:51:21.348 --> 01:51:22.950]  I can play the congressional hearings.
[01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:23.951]  We're being censored.
[01:51:23.951 --> 01:51:25.172]  We're being blacked out.
[01:51:25.172 --> 01:51:25.933]  We're being banned.
[01:51:25.933 --> 01:51:27.856]  And they're calling for our arrest.
[01:51:27.856 --> 01:51:30.899]  Can we pull that video up?
[01:51:30.899 --> 01:51:32.361]  They're all over the news.
[01:51:32.361 --> 01:51:35.925]  The MSNBC piece that I wanted last segment.
[01:51:35.925 --> 01:51:38.868]  I played it three or four times in the last few days.
[01:51:38.868 --> 01:51:40.150]  This is all over the place.
[01:51:40.150 --> 01:51:41.071]  This is happening.
[01:51:42.216 --> 01:51:45.217]  You didn't have all this web censorship under George W. Bush?
[01:51:45.217 --> 01:51:48.177]  I didn't like George W. Bush, but this wasn't going on!
[01:51:48.177 --> 01:51:51.818]  It's been going on under Obama and the Democrats, and it's out of control!
[01:51:51.818 --> 01:51:57.459]  Nate in Sarasota, Florida, go ahead.
[01:51:57.459 --> 01:52:00.820]  Hey Alex, I'm a long-time listener and use your products, I love them.
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:04.601]  I just want to give a shout-out to my dad who's also a long-time listener at Scott in Illinois.
[01:52:04.601 --> 01:52:08.242]  And I just wanted to comment on North Korea.
[01:52:11.712 --> 01:52:14.055]  I lived on the border.
[01:52:14.055 --> 01:52:17.619]  You know I got so flustered I just pulled my headset out.
[01:52:17.619 --> 01:52:19.581]  So I don't have any wire hooked into that.
[01:52:19.581 --> 01:52:21.003]  So just give me a backup.
[01:52:21.003 --> 01:52:22.445]  I won't hook up another one.
[01:52:22.445 --> 01:52:23.866]  I mean I'll just hook up another one.
[01:52:23.866 --> 01:52:25.308]  I won't do a backup.
[01:52:25.308 --> 01:52:27.190]  Quickest thing is just give me a backup.
[01:52:27.190 --> 01:52:28.352]  Quickest thing is just give me another one.
[01:52:29.232 --> 01:52:32.333]  So sick of sniveling cowards out there that can't even actually debate.
[01:52:32.333 --> 01:52:39.976]  They play these fake debate games where they don't talk, they don't respond to you, they just play their narcissistic twit games to feel powerful, call it a show.
[01:52:39.976 --> 01:52:41.616]  I've experienced the massive censorship.
[01:52:41.616 --> 01:52:42.817]  All I need is another headpiece.
[01:52:42.817 --> 01:52:45.418]  That's all I need.
[01:52:45.418 --> 01:52:49.839]  Anyways, let's go ahead and play this clip of MSNBC.
[01:52:49.839 --> 01:52:51.180]  There's a whole bunch of these clips.
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:58.022]  This is just this week, though, calling for Republicans to be arrested after the Democrats overthrew the Republic.
[01:52:58.942 --> 01:53:06.109]  What has the Republican Party in the last 10 years done to help the American people?
[01:53:06.109 --> 01:53:07.050]  What have they done?
[01:53:07.050 --> 01:53:08.692]  This is not a political party.
[01:53:08.692 --> 01:53:10.794]  This is a domestic terror group.
[01:53:10.794 --> 01:53:22.086]  And what I think the American people should consider when they ask themselves that question with a party that has done nothing to help the American people is to vote them out and consider possibly afterwards locking them up, Joy.
[01:53:23.655 --> 01:53:29.205]  And it looks like in this entire building we got one earpiece, so I'm doing the rest of the show without calls, without anything else.
[01:53:29.205 --> 01:53:31.829]  Hey, but at least, ladies and gentlemen, it's a real broadcast.
[01:53:31.829 --> 01:53:33.572]  You can believe there's no damn teleprompters in here.
[01:53:33.572 --> 01:53:36.077]  We're just going up against the Globals toe-to-toe.
[01:53:37.205 --> 01:53:39.327]  I'm going to go back to Nate, who I didn't hear what he had to say.
[01:53:39.327 --> 01:53:41.829]  The one problem with these headsets, I think I'm going to get a different brand of them.
[01:53:41.829 --> 01:53:43.990]  I think I've asked them a few times, but I'm not mad about it.
[01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:55.039]  I like what the studios have, is where it actually is a power pack right here in the chair, and then you plug into that with a big cord, and then it doesn't have a piece that pops out in the back, because it happens every week.
[01:53:55.039 --> 01:53:56.820]  All right, here, let's go.
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:59.442]  Let's go back to the callers.
[01:53:59.442 --> 01:54:01.584]  Anyways, I've just been in fighting mood lately, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:01.584 --> 01:54:02.685]  Nate, repeat what you said.
[01:54:02.685 --> 01:54:03.986]  I apologize that I lost audio.
[01:54:05.404 --> 01:54:07.005]  Hey Alex, you got me?
[01:54:07.005 --> 01:54:09.466]  I GOT YOU GOOD, BABY!
[01:54:09.466 --> 01:54:10.006]  You're right on!
[01:54:10.006 --> 01:54:15.328]  You know it's ironic that I'm an audio engineer.
[01:54:15.328 --> 01:54:17.689]  So yeah, I'm just calling in from sunny Sarasota, Florida.
[01:54:17.689 --> 01:54:19.970]  I'm a longtime listener and I use your products.
[01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:20.330]  I love them.
[01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:23.611]  Just wanted to give a shout out to my dad, a longtime listener in Decatur, Illinois.
[01:54:23.611 --> 01:54:27.793]  His name is Scott and I just wanted to comment on North Korea.
[01:54:27.793 --> 01:54:28.053]  Please!
[01:54:29.625 --> 01:54:38.732]  So I actually lived on the border of North and South Korea for one year in an English camp they call English Village.
[01:54:38.732 --> 01:54:45.977]  It was a theme park set up by the South Korean government to teach the kids of South Korea how to speak English and interact with foreigners.
[01:54:45.977 --> 01:54:53.943]  That's interesting enough, being that it was right on the DMZ in a place called Paju, South Korea.
[01:54:53.943 --> 01:54:58.546]  But to top it off, there's a giant Hollywood sign that says English Village.
[01:54:59.068 --> 01:55:02.932]  With gun turrets behind it facing North Korea.
[01:55:02.932 --> 01:55:17.086]  So at the time, you know, I was a young college student just getting my first job out of after graduating with my bachelor's and I started to realize all these things that maybe we were part of the propaganda of the South as well at the time.
[01:55:18.351 --> 01:55:20.212]  Oh, of course there's propaganda of the South.
[01:55:20.212 --> 01:55:26.756]  You get that guy shot five times trying to come across last week, and then he got all those worms in him, some of them, you know, a foot long.
[01:55:26.756 --> 01:55:27.937]  And it's just, I mean, it's true.
[01:55:27.937 --> 01:55:30.018]  I mean, the South's not perfect.
[01:55:30.018 --> 01:55:35.501]  But I mean, look at how they produce, what is it, 400 and something times more goods than North Korea?
[01:55:35.501 --> 01:55:36.702]  Or 40,000.
[01:55:36.702 --> 01:55:39.103]  It's some ridiculous number.
[01:55:39.103 --> 01:55:40.944]  It's the most productive country in the world.
[01:55:40.944 --> 01:55:43.186]  How can it be so productive when the North isn't?
[01:55:43.186 --> 01:55:45.107]  I mean, what do you think about the whole situation?
[01:55:46.169 --> 01:56:00.473]  So one thing I do want to say about the whole going to war and any kind of war that would take place there is that, you know, everybody's focused on Seoul and proximity of Seoul to the DMZ, which it is close.
[01:56:00.473 --> 01:56:06.735]  But if you, by living there, I used to commute from the DMZ down to Seoul, which took about an hour.
[01:56:06.735 --> 01:56:12.397]  You're passing a population of, you know, between 1 and 3 million just within 10 to 20 miles.
[01:56:13.763 --> 01:56:14.443]  of that border.
[01:56:14.443 --> 01:56:16.225]  So that's one thing.
[01:56:16.225 --> 01:56:17.806]  Yes, none of us want war.
[01:56:17.806 --> 01:56:19.567]  I want North Korea to be free.
[01:56:19.567 --> 01:56:23.949]  I want their people to be able to not be enslaved.
[01:56:23.949 --> 01:56:25.450]  But the North is bad.
[01:56:25.450 --> 01:56:26.711]  I know the South's not perfect.
[01:56:26.711 --> 01:56:27.191]  I know the U.S.
[01:56:27.191 --> 01:56:27.812]  isn't perfect.
[01:56:27.812 --> 01:56:33.535]  But some of us get in this little romantic thing like any other country's good but America.
[01:56:33.535 --> 01:56:36.457]  Isn't North Korea and the communist regime super evil?
[01:56:36.457 --> 01:56:37.778]  I mean, they are super evil.
[01:56:38.561 --> 01:56:48.345]  They're the biggest, let me tell you what, they're the most underestimated evil in the entire world and it's a humanitarian crisis that's been going on for entirely way too long.
[01:56:48.345 --> 01:56:49.786]  I agree, so what do we do?
[01:56:49.786 --> 01:56:50.186]  What do we do?
[01:56:51.329 --> 01:56:51.909]  I know.
[01:56:51.909 --> 01:56:56.072]  There's going to have to be some kind of covert operations going on, going in.
[01:56:56.072 --> 01:56:57.093]  No, and I think that's the answer.
[01:56:57.093 --> 01:57:04.878]  I think to have a coup against that guy, just like East Germany merged with West Germany, it'd be good for everybody, including their own so-called elite.
[01:57:04.878 --> 01:57:14.004]  Give them all amnesty, give them all $10 million apiece, their inner party, there's only 100 of them or so, and just let them leave and then just fix that place.
[01:57:14.004 --> 01:57:14.764]  God bless you, Nate.
[01:57:14.764 --> 01:57:16.906]  By the way, I wasn't mad at the crew or even the caller earlier.
[01:57:17.626 --> 01:57:45.383]  When you've got Trump knocking it out of the park saying investigate the head of NBC for sex behavior and you've got him coming out saying investigate Scarborough for the intern's death in his offices and when you've just got all the missile news and all the crazy news and the and the FCC stuff and all the rest of it it's just I'm overheating here I'm so excited I'm so pumped that I just it's just I am out of control but it's okay I'm gonna get refocused and come back with your phone calls in two minutes on the other side of this break stay with us
[01:57:52.449 --> 01:57:52.989]  We're good to go!
[01:58:21.343 --> 01:58:21.683]  I think so.
[01:58:48.055 --> 01:58:49.657]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:58:49.657 --> 01:58:52.240]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemistry.

[01:59:33.815 --> 01:59:35.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:08.505 --> 02:00:09.826]  You found it.
[02:00:09.826 --> 02:00:12.007]  The tip of the spear.
[02:00:12.007 --> 02:00:17.710]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.710 --> 02:00:19.471]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:19.471 --> 02:00:20.852]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:20.852 --> 02:00:24.094]  I've got so many incredible callers.
[02:00:24.094 --> 02:00:29.177]  Eric and Dave and Joe and Dan and Colt and Christian and Aaron and Mike and Dr. Colette.
[02:00:30.504 --> 02:00:32.144]  North Korea, we got to do something.
[02:00:32.144 --> 02:00:35.265]  That's Mike Aaron, guy who escaped from North Korea.
[02:00:35.265 --> 02:00:36.945]  Let's talk about that.
[02:00:36.945 --> 02:00:40.226]  Vaccines in Korea.
[02:00:40.226 --> 02:00:41.646]  Colt, what's up?
[02:00:41.646 --> 02:00:42.566]  Caveman testimony.
[02:00:42.566 --> 02:00:44.787]  Unfortunately, that product's sold out right now.
[02:00:44.787 --> 02:00:46.027]  We've got Dan in Ohio.
[02:00:46.027 --> 02:00:47.727]  North Korea, EMP attack.
[02:00:47.727 --> 02:00:50.488]  I'm kind of doing this, I haven't read what the callers are talking about yet.
[02:00:50.488 --> 02:00:52.448]  How we should handle North Korea.
[02:00:52.448 --> 02:00:55.269]  North Korea, tool of globalists, absolutely.
[02:00:55.269 --> 02:00:57.389]  Eric, New Mexico, Hollywood pedophilia.
[02:00:57.389 --> 02:00:59.610]  Let's talk about that, because that caller's been holding the longest.
[02:01:00.610 --> 02:01:05.891]  Eric in New Mexico, oh yeah, the pedophilia, the raping of children, it's all coming out.
[02:01:05.891 --> 02:01:17.214]  The arrestor mounting, the Catholic Church, the Protestant Churches, all these big billionaire philanthropists that run child advocacy groups with disadvantaged children who have already been raped.
[02:01:17.214 --> 02:01:18.535]  No one's going to believe them.
[02:01:18.535 --> 02:01:22.796]  The medical exams aren't going to show that they've been raped by them because they've already been raped.
[02:01:24.137 --> 02:01:26.418]  Their bodies have already been torn open.
[02:01:26.418 --> 02:01:34.985]  Hollywood is a group of sadistic, devil-worshipping scum because you can't get in the club at the highest levels unless you're part of that.
[02:01:34.985 --> 02:01:36.267]  It's incredible.
[02:01:36.267 --> 02:01:38.028]  But go ahead, Eric.
[02:01:38.028 --> 02:01:39.049]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:39.049 --> 02:01:39.709]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:40.070]  I can.
[02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:41.611]  Thank you for calling.
[02:01:41.611 --> 02:01:41.911]  Awesome.
[02:01:41.911 --> 02:01:42.231]  Thank you.
[02:01:42.231 --> 02:01:45.654]  First off, God bless you and your team for everything you do.
[02:01:45.654 --> 02:01:49.117]  God bless the team for putting up with me because this isn't an act in here.
[02:01:49.117 --> 02:01:51.019]  I'm bouncing off the wall some days.
[02:01:51.949 --> 02:01:52.630]  That's okay.
[02:01:52.630 --> 02:01:54.411]  It's entertaining.
[02:01:54.411 --> 02:02:01.476]  You know, this Hollywood thing, it's really gotten to me because, you know, I come from a generation that just loved movies.
[02:02:01.476 --> 02:02:04.099]  I loved them so much.
[02:02:04.099 --> 02:02:07.101]  It's what made me want to become an artist, actually.
[02:02:08.207 --> 02:02:14.889]  And now you see all this stuff happening and you like you can't even watch movies or TV anymore.
[02:02:14.889 --> 02:02:16.130]  You know why that is?
[02:02:16.130 --> 02:02:21.971]  Evil wants to superimpose itself in front of art to control culture and then to dominate everybody.
[02:02:21.971 --> 02:02:25.052]  So yeah, there's a lot of beautiful art, incredible people in Hollywood.
[02:02:25.052 --> 02:02:26.533]  They're being fed on by the vampires.
[02:02:26.533 --> 02:02:29.774]  The vampire goes where the freshest, best meat is.
[02:02:29.774 --> 02:02:32.675]  So I mean, I wouldn't be disenfranchised or disillusioned by that.
[02:02:33.806 --> 02:02:56.497]  Well, I just think it's harder to, I mean, I'm starting to find a bunch of artists myself who are more conservative and have become conservative over the course of the last two years and trying to fight back against this, to bring back some of the values that, you know... Oh, I've had, I've had top producers, I mean, when I say top producers, I mean people as big as Ron Howard, not Ron Howard, but you know, as big as somebody like that.
[02:02:57.037 --> 02:03:00.640]  Come here to the office, meet with me, want to do projects, but I'm like, well, what do you want to do?
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:02.301]  And they're all closeted libertarians.
[02:03:02.301 --> 02:03:03.582]  They're not really conservatives.
[02:03:03.582 --> 02:03:05.503]  You know, Kurt Russell spoke out.
[02:03:05.503 --> 02:03:06.344]  There's not that many.
[02:03:06.344 --> 02:03:08.145]  Bruce Willis is a patriot.
[02:03:08.145 --> 02:03:10.207]  But when it comes to producers, there's a lot of them.
[02:03:10.207 --> 02:03:11.448]  They're just Americana.
[02:03:11.448 --> 02:03:12.409]  They're not out to get the country.
[02:03:12.409 --> 02:03:14.350]  They're not pedophiles.
[02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:15.991]  And, you know, and they say, what are we going to do?
[02:03:15.991 --> 02:03:16.552]  And I'm just like.
[02:03:17.092 --> 02:03:37.372]  Yeah, well come out to LA or come out to Houston and meet with some of the guys and let's make a production with you and I'm like these are guys that have had like shows with 200 million dollar budgets on HBO okay and you know stuff like that and it's just the end of the day I I just I just can't interface with it because Hollywood's never gonna let anything good come out of it in my view that's overtly pro-human.
[02:03:37.372 --> 02:03:37.953]  Does that make sense?
[02:03:38.994 --> 02:03:39.715]  Absolutely.
[02:03:39.715 --> 02:03:46.481]  So what do you think we can do, like, especially for the artists that I'm finding, like, because I make children's books now.
[02:03:46.481 --> 02:03:56.770]  That's kind of my, um, and I saw that report you did on that, uh, nasty little, what was it, a Disney book, my baby's... Feminist baby, yeah, it's sexualizing newborn babies.
[02:03:57.694 --> 02:04:00.698]  Right, and it's just par for the course.
[02:04:00.698 --> 02:04:13.133]  It becomes harder as a self-publisher, especially to get your work out there when you're dealing with so much negativity and evil and nastiness and, as you put it, the vampires of Hollywood.
[02:04:13.873 --> 02:04:16.216]  Um, to get this information out?
[02:04:16.216 --> 02:04:18.037]  Well, I think, I mean, I think we have to vote with our dollars.
[02:04:18.037 --> 02:04:24.122]  You've already got some of the top grossing films now are Christian, and from that it could just grow saying, hey, we're independent.
[02:04:24.122 --> 02:04:24.803]  You have a label.
[02:04:24.803 --> 02:04:25.904]  Hey, we're anti-Hollywood.
[02:04:25.904 --> 02:04:27.826]  Hey, we're outside the system.
[02:04:27.826 --> 02:04:30.108]  And if people just do that, it's going to change the world.
[02:04:30.108 --> 02:04:31.729]  God bless you, Eric.
[02:04:31.729 --> 02:04:32.209]  Great call.
[02:04:33.328 --> 02:04:36.810]  We've got more of your amazing phone calls on the other side.
[02:04:36.810 --> 02:04:42.353]  Joseph Farah is going to be popping in as well, on a way to support the president.
[02:04:42.353 --> 02:04:55.240]  And believe me, I'm anti-establishment, folks, but when I see a president delivering 3.3% growth rate, going after the pedophiles, crushing ISIS and Al Qaeda, and calling out Scarborough, I salute the commander.

[02:06:12.748 --> 02:06:14.411]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:14.411 --> 02:06:16.074]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:16.074 --> 02:06:20.782]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:39.108 --> 02:06:41.189]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:42.610]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:42.610 --> 02:06:44.791]  Let me just recap before I go back to your calls.
[02:06:44.791 --> 02:06:51.774]  The incredible developments of the quickening as things just accelerate and get more insane by the moment.
[02:06:51.774 --> 02:06:58.677]  As we predicted, they're flushing the Hollywood, the Prestitute Corps, the Matt Lowers, the Charlie Roses.
[02:06:58.677 --> 02:07:01.659]  All of them are being deposited now into the toilet.
[02:07:02.532 --> 02:07:02.732]  I don't
[02:07:19.994 --> 02:07:20.314]  I predict
[02:07:38.459 --> 02:07:46.302]  Patriotoid, kind of fake Christian, but people that attack Trump and the Liberty Movement and that cause infighting.
[02:07:46.302 --> 02:07:51.404]  That's going to be the next row of teeth now that those have been sanguinated.
[02:07:51.404 --> 02:07:54.886]  The last row of teeth have been sucked out of their rotting jaws.
[02:07:54.886 --> 02:07:58.247]  But Trump just, I mean, I'm not into power.
[02:07:58.247 --> 02:07:59.768]  I'm not into cult of personality.
[02:07:59.768 --> 02:08:00.948]  I'm not into presidents.
[02:08:00.948 --> 02:08:01.909]  Couldn't stand Obama.
[02:08:01.909 --> 02:08:03.389]  Couldn't stand George Bush.
[02:08:03.389 --> 02:08:04.430]  Can't stand any of these people.
[02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:14.468]  Reagan, I studied his history, liked him as a guy, he wasn't a bad guy, but, you know, he kind of got stymied early on and never really, you know, did a lot of what he wanted.
[02:08:14.468 --> 02:08:16.529]  We've got a 3.3% growth rate right now.
[02:08:16.529 --> 02:08:17.590]  They said it never hit 3%.
[02:08:17.590 --> 02:08:20.391]  We've got 70% reduction in illegals coming across.
[02:08:20.391 --> 02:08:21.772]  We've got him battling for tax cuts.
[02:08:21.772 --> 02:08:25.554]  We've got hundreds of billions in new jobs, 1.6 million new jobs.
[02:08:25.554 --> 02:08:27.835]  We've got the stock market at all-time highs.
[02:08:27.835 --> 02:08:29.336]  We've got globalists hating him.
[02:08:29.336 --> 02:08:31.237]  We've got Trump making real deals in the Middle East.
[02:08:32.375 --> 02:08:41.280]  And decapitating Al-Qaeda and ISIS and rolling up the Muslim Brotherhood, Clinton-connected, globalist-connected arm of Islam.
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:44.642]  You've got Trump saying investigate the head of NBC for going after folks.
[02:08:44.642 --> 02:08:49.925]  As we know, this is executives trying to burn their low-level folks as a way to try to appease the public.
[02:08:51.007 --> 02:08:53.049]  Investigate Scarborough over death of intern.
[02:08:53.049 --> 02:08:54.070]  That's the president.
[02:08:54.070 --> 02:09:03.358]  With this type of bare knuckles attack, because they've really gone after him, they've tried to destroy him, the first six months or so he tried to work with him.
[02:09:03.358 --> 02:09:05.760]  It's over folks, gloves are off now.
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:08.282]  Gloves are off, and you're seeing a real president.
[02:09:08.282 --> 02:09:08.903]  Is he perfect?
[02:09:08.903 --> 02:09:09.363]  No.
[02:09:09.363 --> 02:09:15.629]  But he's not out to get the country, he's incredibly dynamic, he has such courage, and I just want to say,
[02:09:16.857 --> 02:09:20.679]  People that aren't thankful in life, I found that's the number one ingredient of evil.
[02:09:20.679 --> 02:09:22.580]  Number one is Joseph Farrow, we just got online.
[02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:26.643]  The New York Call is at the bottom of the hour, so stay there callers.
[02:09:26.643 --> 02:09:32.006]  I've learned in my life the number one thing of decadence and losers is they're not thankful.
[02:09:32.006 --> 02:09:36.849]  And the thing that really leads to all sorts of mental illness and you name it is not being thankful.
[02:09:37.745 --> 02:09:50.149]  My dad taught me this more than anybody, but I'm telling you right now, I'm so thankful for God, I'm so thankful for Donald Trump, I'm so thankful for you, I'm so thankful for Joseph Farah and Matt Drudge, because let me tell you, it's scary when there's only 10 or 15 people that are actually on the front line.
[02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:51.150]  Now it's more!
[02:09:51.150 --> 02:09:52.950]  I don't see all these groups as competition.
[02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:55.491]  They try to stir up fights with me and Breitbart, I'm not doing it.
[02:09:55.491 --> 02:09:57.032]  Stir up fights with WorldNetDaily, I'm not doing it.
[02:09:57.032 --> 02:09:58.392]  Stir up fights, I'm not doing it.
[02:09:58.392 --> 02:10:00.193]  Because let me tell you something, this is a real war.
[02:10:00.193 --> 02:10:06.335]  When you've had the stuff happen behind the scenes that's happened to Joseph Farah, myself and others, it's a fraternity.
[02:10:06.335 --> 02:10:06.915]  It's a club.
[02:10:07.515 --> 02:10:10.456]  And let me tell you, we're not sitting up here like, oh, we're special.
[02:10:10.456 --> 02:10:12.396]  We want you to make us not special.
[02:10:12.396 --> 02:10:13.536]  We want to be obsolete.
[02:10:13.536 --> 02:10:17.957]  I don't think I can speak for Joseph Farah, but he's been a journalist for 50 years and fighting the globalists.
[02:10:17.957 --> 02:10:20.918]  One of the first people to ever do it and the Western Journalism Center.
[02:10:20.918 --> 02:10:25.599]  But I just know at my age and Joseph, let me ask you this question.
[02:10:25.599 --> 02:10:26.199]  Let me guess.
[02:10:26.199 --> 02:10:29.840]  I bet you're kind of getting excited to see a lot of new folks come on board.
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:33.560]  You're still going to be there and you're still going to fight because you realize the fight's greater now than ever.
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:35.381]  But looking a few, you know,
[02:10:36.381 --> 02:10:39.584]  Years down the line, bigger waves of liberty coming.
[02:10:39.584 --> 02:10:52.695]  I almost can feel the beginnings of understanding that we're going to be eclipsed probably sooner rather than later and that as masters, and I'm not saying that in a power way, but as true masters of fighting the globalists, not that we're that good, but we are at the master level.
[02:10:52.695 --> 02:10:53.456]  We're the best there is.
[02:10:54.866 --> 02:10:58.187]  That we can see people coming up that are going to surpass us.
[02:10:58.187 --> 02:11:02.468]  Is that not the greatest satisfaction in your life, or close to it?
[02:11:02.468 --> 02:11:04.949]  Absolutely, especially when you get to my age, Alex.
[02:11:04.949 --> 02:11:06.689]  You know, I'm older than you are.
[02:11:06.689 --> 02:11:08.730]  You're just a kid by comparison.
[02:11:08.730 --> 02:11:13.231]  But, you know, you wanted to make me older, though, because you said I've been doing this for 50 years.
[02:11:13.231 --> 02:11:13.511]  No.
[02:11:13.511 --> 02:11:15.932]  Okay, you've been a journalist for, what, 40?
[02:11:15.932 --> 02:11:17.172]  40-something?
[02:11:17.172 --> 02:11:18.213]  Yeah, 40 years.
[02:11:18.213 --> 02:11:19.533]  That's enough, okay?
[02:11:19.533 --> 02:11:22.914]  Well, by the way, you look better than I do at your age, so you're a champion.
[02:11:23.874 --> 02:11:24.715]  You're absolutely right.
[02:11:24.715 --> 02:11:37.471]  The most gratifying thing is to see, you know, you do something like we did years and years ago, and you see it having impact, and you see others coming behind you, and you say, thank God!
[02:11:37.471 --> 02:11:39.494]  We got reinforcements behind us!
[02:11:39.494 --> 02:11:42.718]  We're not the only ones responsible for doing this anymore!
[02:11:43.038 --> 02:11:44.679]  I welcome that competition.
[02:11:44.679 --> 02:11:47.480]  I know you do, Alex, because we're all a little bit different.
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:50.201]  None of us are doing the same thing.
[02:11:50.201 --> 02:11:54.262]  When people ask me, who are your competitors?
[02:11:54.262 --> 02:11:55.983]  Is it Breitbart?
[02:11:55.983 --> 02:11:57.163]  Is it Alex Jones?
[02:11:57.163 --> 02:11:57.223]  No!
[02:11:58.764 --> 02:12:04.187]  The competition is CNN, the New York Times, the fake news cartel.
[02:12:04.187 --> 02:12:06.668]  Not Alex Jones and Breitbart.
[02:12:06.668 --> 02:12:08.068]  We love you guys.
[02:12:08.068 --> 02:12:09.489]  Thank you for being there.
[02:12:09.489 --> 02:12:10.810]  We can't do it all by ourselves.
[02:12:10.810 --> 02:12:15.972]  It's like an armada battle and we've all got our ships on the same team, the same navy, battling the enemy.
[02:12:15.972 --> 02:12:21.114]  And I don't want young folks getting involved and not getting involved in the infighting or thinking about who's the biggest or the best.
[02:12:21.114 --> 02:12:22.875]  We're in a literal death battle.
[02:12:22.875 --> 02:12:24.116]  The globalists have called it that.
[02:12:24.116 --> 02:12:25.476]  This is a total war.
[02:12:25.476 --> 02:12:26.817]  We need total commitment.
[02:12:27.734 --> 02:12:29.536]  That's right.
[02:12:29.536 --> 02:12:32.079]  We've been around for 20 years, as you know, more than 20.
[02:12:32.079 --> 02:12:33.660]  Going on 21 now.
[02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:38.746]  We face existential threats every single one of those years, okay?
[02:12:38.746 --> 02:12:43.651]  And it's not just because, you know, it wasn't just from Obama or from Clinton.
[02:12:43.651 --> 02:12:47.315]  You know what else causes us existential threats?
[02:12:47.315 --> 02:12:49.317]  Is when people think everything's going well.
[02:12:53.317 --> 02:12:59.963]  And you know, frankly, right now, I think things are going great and that's why I came on here to talk to you about it.
[02:12:59.963 --> 02:13:02.926]  You know, I'm really, I'm excited about Trump.
[02:13:02.926 --> 02:13:06.810]  And we've got to give him support because it means a lot to him.
[02:13:06.810 --> 02:13:10.013]  So tell folks about this great initiative you've come up with.
[02:13:10.013 --> 02:13:13.215]  Well, I'm going to tell you about it, but I first want to say this.
[02:13:13.215 --> 02:13:15.718]  I think what we're seeing right now, Alex, is
[02:13:16.684 --> 02:13:19.505]  We have not seen anything like this in our lifetimes.
[02:13:19.505 --> 02:13:20.966]  Would you agree with me on that?
[02:13:20.966 --> 02:13:22.347]  I'm absolutely downfounded.
[02:13:22.347 --> 02:13:23.487]  It's incredible.
[02:13:23.487 --> 02:13:24.968]  I mean, I was around for Reagan.
[02:13:24.968 --> 02:13:38.895]  In fact, Reagan was the thing that got the guy, the personality who took me from the far left to being a constitutional, you know, limited government kind of guy.
[02:13:38.895 --> 02:13:41.336]  Okay, that's what Reagan did for me.
[02:13:41.336 --> 02:13:43.057]  But what Trump is doing,
[02:13:43.835 --> 02:13:47.157]  In his first year, the accomplishments are greater.
[02:13:47.157 --> 02:13:49.519]  They're more stunning.
[02:13:49.519 --> 02:13:51.901]  I'm just amazed at how much he's doing.
[02:13:51.901 --> 02:13:53.722]  And that's why they're so scared.
[02:13:53.722 --> 02:13:56.123]  He's taken us completely off defense.
[02:13:56.123 --> 02:13:57.824]  He's on offense all the time.
[02:13:57.824 --> 02:14:01.507]  You talked about him, you know, tweeting about NBC.
[02:14:01.507 --> 02:14:05.089]  And today, Matt Lauer gets fired.
[02:14:05.089 --> 02:14:06.270]  Is that unbelievable?
[02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:06.971]  It's incredible.
[02:14:08.351 --> 02:14:09.432]  Is there a connection?
[02:14:09.432 --> 02:14:10.772]  I have no idea.
[02:14:10.772 --> 02:14:17.156]  But let me tell you about what, you know, I was thinking about this for months and I said, how do we respond to this?
[02:14:17.156 --> 02:14:26.721]  To this incredible precedent shattering thing where a president comes in and he's here to attack the deep state and he means it.
[02:14:26.721 --> 02:14:27.882]  He actually means it.
[02:14:27.882 --> 02:14:30.803]  You know, he didn't just run on that to get elected.
[02:14:30.803 --> 02:14:32.885]  He takes it seriously.
[02:14:32.885 --> 02:14:37.107]  And so how do we go about supporting that?
[02:14:38.019 --> 02:14:45.301]  And it occurred to me that with all of the incredible opposition this guy faces, you know what?
[02:14:45.301 --> 02:14:53.102]  We can have a pity party, Alex Jones and Farah, about all the people who have attacked us and, you know, opposed us all along.
[02:14:53.102 --> 02:14:56.623]  It's nothing compared to what Trump is facing.
[02:14:56.623 --> 02:14:58.504]  And he just laughs it off.
[02:14:58.504 --> 02:14:59.424]  He just tweets.
[02:15:00.724 --> 02:15:03.226]  And he changes the dynamic of the debate.
[02:15:03.226 --> 02:15:04.467]  You gotta love that.
[02:15:04.467 --> 02:15:06.749]  So I'm thinking, what do we do?
[02:15:06.749 --> 02:15:08.190]  How do we thank this guy?
[02:15:08.190 --> 02:15:14.636]  How do we encourage that behavior to continue for the next seven years?
[02:15:14.636 --> 02:15:15.997]  So I came up with this idea.
[02:15:15.997 --> 02:15:21.561]  I don't know if it's anything great shakes or not, but people are responding and I'm excited about it.
[02:15:21.561 --> 02:15:23.923]  It's called the Thank Trump Campaign.
[02:15:23.923 --> 02:15:26.165]  ThankTrump.us.
[02:15:26.165 --> 02:15:27.246]  And the idea is this.
[02:15:27.944 --> 02:15:33.527]  We should be thanking this guy every day for what he is accomplishing.
[02:15:33.527 --> 02:15:33.967]  Exactly.
[02:15:33.967 --> 02:15:34.447]  Stay there.
[02:15:34.447 --> 02:15:35.568]  Tell us about it when we come back.
[02:15:35.568 --> 02:15:38.389]  WorldNetDaily.com, WND.com, Joseph Farah.
[02:15:38.389 --> 02:15:39.350]  I should have introduced you better.
[02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:42.832]  Founder of the Western Journalism Center, then WorldNetDaily.
[02:15:42.832 --> 02:15:43.792]  Not just 21 years.
[02:15:43.792 --> 02:15:48.975]  This guy's been fighting, like you said, 40 years since he woke up against the globalists.
[02:15:48.975 --> 02:15:49.495]  He'll be back.
[02:15:49.495 --> 02:15:50.676]  I've only been doing it 22 years.
[02:15:50.676 --> 02:15:52.317]  Like you said, I'm a spring chicken.
[02:15:52.317 --> 02:15:52.857]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:56.004 --> 02:15:57.966]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:15:57.966 --> 02:16:03.291]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:16:03.291 --> 02:16:04.873]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:16:04.873 --> 02:16:13.221]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:16:13.221 --> 02:16:18.927]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:16:19.087 --> 02:16:20.908]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:16:20.908 --> 02:16:23.189]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:27.572]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:16:27.572 --> 02:16:29.773]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:17:30.025 --> 02:17:31.625]  Savory and delicious.
[02:17:31.625 --> 02:17:34.446]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[02:17:38.207 --> 02:17:39.767]  NASA PAC Technology.
[02:17:39.767 --> 02:17:40.387]  Bacon.

[02:17:44.548 --> 02:17:45.968]  Or warm and served.
[02:17:45.968 --> 02:17:48.029]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:17:48.029 --> 02:17:49.969]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[02:17:57.299 --> 02:18:00.421]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:18:00.421 --> 02:18:07.865]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:18:07.865 --> 02:18:13.468]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:18:14.188 --> 02:18:21.895]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:18:21.895 --> 02:18:29.802]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:18:30.502 --> 02:18:35.565]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:18:35.565 --> 02:18:37.707]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:18:37.707 --> 02:18:51.075]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at infowarstore.com.

[02:19:42.565 --> 02:19:45.147]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.

[02:19:58.333 --> 02:20:00.974]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.951 --> 02:20:33.495]  I'm Alex Jones, Joseph Ferrer is our guest for one more segment and your phone calls are coming up.
[02:20:33.495 --> 02:20:35.596]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:35.596 --> 02:20:40.518]  Because there is a war on for your life.
[02:20:40.518 --> 02:20:50.664]  And if we just make it through this fight and this season and defeat the globalists and reinvent America, reboot it, then it can all be Mayberry USA.
[02:20:50.664 --> 02:20:51.284]  Worldwide.
[02:20:52.526 --> 02:20:57.573]  The ideology we're promoting is way better than communism, socialism, fascism.
[02:20:57.573 --> 02:21:02.339]  But if you go to thinktrump.us, what a great idea, Joseph Farah.
[02:21:03.650 --> 02:21:13.980]  The true pioneer of Patriot, Libertarian, Americana media to promote basic Americana that Trump has now fully begun to reboot the country with.
[02:21:13.980 --> 02:21:18.945]  And I know these are just postcards online you can send for free to the President and share to others.
[02:21:18.945 --> 02:21:20.186]  But man, that'd be a great hat.
[02:21:20.186 --> 02:21:21.087]  Magnificent.
[02:21:21.087 --> 02:21:22.108]  All this stuff.
[02:21:22.108 --> 02:21:22.889]  Great graphic stuff.
[02:21:22.889 --> 02:21:25.031]  Mr. President, thank you for your service.
[02:21:25.031 --> 02:21:27.674]  You know, I've seen President Trump talk about the veterans and how great they are, and they are.
[02:21:28.174 --> 02:21:28.494]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:21:51.013 --> 02:22:00.457]  I gotta tell you, the thing I'm excited about this is, you know, we worked with the White House to ensure that we had a path to get these messages to Trump.
[02:22:00.457 --> 02:22:02.578]  That's what people need to understand.
[02:22:02.578 --> 02:22:06.020]  I mean, I don't know if, you know, we're over 10,000 now.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:08.381]  Did Donald Trump read 10,000?
[02:22:08.381 --> 02:22:12.843]  No, but I have a feeling maybe he has somebody who's keeping him up to date on this kind of stuff.
[02:22:12.843 --> 02:22:15.704]  And maybe one of these days we can get him to tweet this.
[02:22:16.344 --> 02:22:16.665]  We're good.
[02:22:39.885 --> 02:22:47.031]  Alex Jones, you recognize that and I appreciate you bringing this to the attention of your vast audience.
[02:22:47.031 --> 02:22:49.873]  Oh absolutely, but I mean it's bigger than that.
[02:22:49.873 --> 02:22:52.035]  Psychologically something happens when we're thankful.
[02:22:53.374 --> 02:23:02.798]  And plus, it's also everybody sharing these memes with each other, so we can think about all the President's done, and how good this is.
[02:23:02.798 --> 02:23:05.138]  Imagine if Hillary was in right now.
[02:23:05.138 --> 02:23:11.321]  So everybody needs to go to the site ThinkTrump.us and explain how they do this.
[02:23:11.321 --> 02:23:12.321]  It's very easy.
[02:23:12.321 --> 02:23:14.602]  We've linked it on Infowars.com.
[02:23:14.602 --> 02:23:16.783]  And make this about the President and I agree.
[02:23:17.603 --> 02:23:19.584]  Because Twitter admits they want to ban him.
[02:23:19.584 --> 02:23:24.707]  They blocked positive stuff getting to him at the top because they know he interfaces with the public.
[02:23:24.707 --> 02:23:32.351]  People in person should print these off of color printers, hand it to him when he's out on the road, mail it into Trump Tower, mail it into Mar-a-Lago.
[02:23:32.351 --> 02:23:35.072]  That's where he actually gets his mail, giving you some inside baseball.
[02:23:35.072 --> 02:23:38.994]  Folks, this is Norman Rockwell stuff you've put together here.
[02:23:38.994 --> 02:23:40.015]  It's very beautiful.
[02:23:40.015 --> 02:23:41.616]  Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily.
[02:23:41.616 --> 02:23:44.197]  So again, tell folks how they do this and why we're doing it.
[02:23:44.778 --> 02:23:45.639]  Well, it's so easy.
[02:23:45.639 --> 02:23:48.421]  Just go to thanktrump.us.
[02:23:48.421 --> 02:23:52.764]  It'll instantly take you to this special page where you've got nine different cards.
[02:23:52.764 --> 02:23:55.146]  We've added a few recently, added three recently.
[02:23:55.146 --> 02:23:56.907]  We'll probably add some more.
[02:23:56.907 --> 02:23:59.669]  People get bored looking at the same cards over and over again.
[02:23:59.669 --> 02:24:03.251]  There's a counter on there which shows which are the most popular.
[02:24:03.251 --> 02:24:04.492]  There's a counter at the bottom.
[02:24:04.492 --> 02:24:06.974]  This is how many people have participated so far.
[02:24:06.974 --> 02:24:10.196]  In just over a week, we've gotten 10,000.
[02:24:10.196 --> 02:24:13.779]  I know with Alex Jones's audience out there looking at this thing,
[02:24:14.039 --> 02:24:16.860]  I can already see the counter moving right now.
[02:24:16.860 --> 02:24:18.640]  So I appreciate that.
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:21.401]  This is not a Joseph Farah show.
[02:24:21.401 --> 02:24:23.221]  It's not a WND show.
[02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:35.765]  This is really about the wonderful, amazing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity we have to change our country fundamentally because of the election in 2016.
[02:24:35.765 --> 02:24:40.186]  Well, I was about to say, though, I mean, people are so
[02:24:43.126 --> 02:24:44.206]  Instant gratification.
[02:24:44.206 --> 02:24:46.387]  We better thank our lucky stars.
[02:24:46.387 --> 02:24:49.188]  The Supreme Court we've got.
[02:24:49.188 --> 02:24:50.628]  What's happened with the economy.
[02:24:50.628 --> 02:24:51.068]  All of it.
[02:24:51.068 --> 02:24:55.109]  I mean, they planned to sew it all up when Hillary got in.
[02:24:55.109 --> 02:24:56.190]  The censorship.
[02:24:56.190 --> 02:24:56.790]  The control.
[02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:58.290]  They're still trying to go ahead with it.
[02:24:58.290 --> 02:25:04.092]  And now, his new head of the FCC is going after them for attacking our free speech and defending free speech.
[02:25:04.092 --> 02:25:05.012]  I mean, this is amazing!
[02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:08.061]  I love it.
[02:25:08.061 --> 02:25:14.307]  What hit me was watching these accomplishments almost every single day.
[02:25:14.307 --> 02:25:16.149]  Things that are so shocking.
[02:25:16.149 --> 02:25:21.914]  You know, we got so despondent after all the eight years of Obama.
[02:25:21.914 --> 02:25:24.837]  We didn't have victories like this in a whole year ever!
[02:25:24.837 --> 02:25:26.619]  It's a total turning of the tide!
[02:25:26.619 --> 02:25:28.661]  I mean, I cannot believe how thankful I am!
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:36.123]  I haven't been this thankful, and I'm even more thankful than I was then in the 80s when Ronald Reagan was around.
[02:25:36.123 --> 02:25:39.784]  You know, for me, I thought we'd never see his likes again.
[02:25:39.784 --> 02:25:43.085]  What we're seeing right now is even more exciting.
[02:25:43.085 --> 02:25:45.206]  Trump is a man of action.
[02:25:45.206 --> 02:25:46.907]  He's a man of courage.
[02:25:46.907 --> 02:25:48.407]  He cannot be deterred.
[02:25:48.407 --> 02:25:55.610]  He doesn't care what people say about him, but the fact that he doesn't care what his enemies say about him is one thing.
[02:25:56.344 --> 02:25:58.753]  I think what we need to do... Oh, he does care about us.
[02:25:58.753 --> 02:26:01.483]  He does, and they've done everything they can to cut him off from the people.
[02:26:02.395 --> 02:26:06.298]  And that's why ThankTrump.us was invented.
[02:26:32.615 --> 02:26:36.958]  The Liberty Movement, you, your readers, your listeners, Drudge's, everybody together.
[02:26:36.958 --> 02:26:43.262]  This is all our shared victory, and it shows what we can do when we finally get off the porch.
[02:26:43.262 --> 02:26:45.104]  I'm glad you mentioned Mr. Drudge.
[02:26:45.104 --> 02:26:46.384]  He was one of my favorites.
[02:26:46.384 --> 02:26:47.425]  Loved the guy.
[02:26:47.425 --> 02:26:48.986]  But so far, he's not on board.
[02:26:48.986 --> 02:26:52.869]  Now, I know Alex Jones has a pipeline to Matt Drudge.
[02:26:52.869 --> 02:26:54.270]  I know that for a fact.
[02:26:54.270 --> 02:26:56.271]  Matt Drudge has even told me that.
[02:26:56.271 --> 02:26:58.553]  So maybe you could shake things up with Matt.
[02:26:59.193 --> 02:27:00.294]  I know, but you know how Matt is.
[02:27:00.294 --> 02:27:08.058]  It's just so many people contacting me constantly is that, I mean, we need to get a news article out there about how, you know, thank President Trump hashtag.
[02:27:08.058 --> 02:27:11.319]  We should get a hashtag going, hashtag thank Trump.
[02:27:11.319 --> 02:27:12.740]  Let's launch that hashtag.
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:28.588]  Everybody, I don't know how Twitter works properly, I'm not an expert on it, but just, we'll do a hashtag thank Trump, and just everything he's done, everybody should do articles and your own memes, and the answer is get everybody doing what WorldNetDaily and Joseph Farah has done, and that's what's going to cause a hydrogen bomb explosion
[02:27:28.948 --> 02:27:38.378]  Of thankfulness, because again, if we're not thankful for the fact that, imagine, just the minute we have left, what would it be like if Hillary was in office right now?
[02:27:39.888 --> 02:27:44.289]  It's unthinkable, you know, and when you said her name, I got the chills.
[02:27:44.289 --> 02:27:59.293]  I mean, I literally said, and I think that still has an impact on people just seeing her face, hearing the latest thing that she's, you know, responsible for this, you know, firing of this inspector general that we heard about and so forth.
[02:27:59.293 --> 02:28:02.153]  It's unbelievable what a contrast we have.
[02:28:02.153 --> 02:28:07.915]  I was about to say the inspector general on her and Uranium One caught red handed and it's hardly even in the news.
[02:28:07.915 --> 02:28:08.915]  Threatening his family.
[02:28:09.713 --> 02:28:10.273]  Uh-huh.
[02:28:10.273 --> 02:28:11.715]  Yeah, incredible stuff.
[02:28:11.715 --> 02:28:19.040]  That's the world we lived in up until January 20th, 2017, and we've seen a major change.
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:20.021]  Absolutely.
[02:28:20.021 --> 02:28:22.823]  Folks, we may never see this again.
[02:28:22.823 --> 02:28:30.649]  We may never live for an opportunity of this kind, and that's why I'm here talking about it, because it's important.
[02:28:30.649 --> 02:28:31.869]  He needs encouragement.
[02:28:31.869 --> 02:28:32.690]  He needs support.
[02:28:32.690 --> 02:28:33.651]  He needs it public.
[02:28:34.312 --> 02:28:35.853]  And that's what this campaign is about.
[02:28:55.649 --> 02:28:58.230]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:28:58.230 --> 02:29:00.370]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:29:00.370 --> 02:29:02.351]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[02:29:02.351 --> 02:29:04.411]  Find your happiness with Pure Soap.

[02:29:19.058 --> 02:29:21.320]  Earth-friendly and natural soaps.
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:23.082]  Your family deserves the best.
[02:29:23.082 --> 02:29:25.765]  Happiness is 5Starsoap.com.

[02:29:59.906 --> 02:30:04.179]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:30:07.130 --> 02:30:11.773]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[02:30:11.773 --> 02:30:27.624]  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,
[02:30:30.886 --> 02:30:31.747]  We're good to go.
[02:30:56.767 --> 02:30:59.891]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:30:59.891 --> 02:31:07.339]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:31:07.339 --> 02:31:12.945]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:31:13.685 --> 02:31:21.370]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:31:21.370 --> 02:31:29.256]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:31:29.956 --> 02:31:35.019]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:37.160]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:31:37.160 --> 02:31:50.547]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at infowarstore.com.
[02:31:50.547 --> 02:31:54.509]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[02:31:55.603 --> 02:32:05.807]  Not content with an apology, alleged victims of Bill Clinton, Al Franken, John Conyers, Joe Barton and others have scheduled a press conference this week in Washington, D.C.
[02:32:05.807 --> 02:32:09.308]  In a press release, the women say, our message is clear.
[02:32:09.308 --> 02:32:13.429]  Both Senator Franken and Congressman Conyers must resign now.
[02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:20.332]  And Congress must end taxpayer-funded payouts to harassment victims in an effort to silence their voices and complaints.
[02:32:20.772 --> 02:32:26.595]  One of the women is just the latest to come forward, accusing former President Bill Clinton of sexual crimes.
[02:32:26.595 --> 02:32:32.578]  Leslie Milley said she was very prepared to come forward and talk about her encounters with Bill Clinton in the 80s.
[02:32:32.578 --> 02:32:39.922]  But once the Monica Lewinsky story broke, she feared not only the media storm that would result, but also Hillary Clinton herself.
[02:32:39.922 --> 02:32:48.947]  Senator Franken is facing backlash for his lame attempt at an apology, while Congressman Conyers has stepped down as ranking member of House Judiciary Committee.
[02:32:49.207 --> 02:32:52.169]  So far, both lawmakers have refused to resign.
[02:32:52.169 --> 02:32:57.332]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[02:32:57.332 --> 02:33:09.761]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:09.761 --> 02:33:15.845]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.035 --> 02:33:28.122]  Alright, I've got like 15 phone calls to go to here and I can't wait to talk to each and every one of you, Joe and Dan and Colton, Christian and Aaron and Mike and Dr. Colette and everybody.
[02:33:28.122 --> 02:33:32.105]  So I'm going to start going to them here in just a moment.
[02:33:32.105 --> 02:33:41.332]  That said, the globalists thought we were weak because we were asleep.
[02:33:41.332 --> 02:33:45.275]  But just like they can poison insects with a pesticide and 95% of them die,
[02:33:46.937 --> 02:33:48.538]  Because they didn't know what hit them.
[02:33:48.538 --> 02:33:55.701]  The 5% that survive, then reproduce, and they're pesticide resistant or pesticide immune.
[02:33:55.701 --> 02:33:59.102]  There's some bugs, you just dump the poison on them, they don't care.
[02:33:59.102 --> 02:34:00.703]  They mutate.
[02:34:00.703 --> 02:34:09.427]  And so they've hit our past generations with high-tech brainwashing, Hollywood movies, got them put into a trance.
[02:34:09.427 --> 02:34:11.428]  But now that we're awakening from the trance,
[02:34:12.665 --> 02:34:19.290]  The curve of people becoming resistant to the propaganda and immune to it skyrockets.
[02:34:19.290 --> 02:34:22.012]  See, once you get any resistance, it's over.
[02:34:22.012 --> 02:34:28.716]  That's why they said there's no world government, there's no pedophile rings, there's no devil worship, there's no GMO, there's none of this.
[02:34:28.716 --> 02:34:34.941]  They just want to deny it like you're a kid, have no debate about it, because they can't win the debate because what they're doing is so bad.
[02:34:34.941 --> 02:34:41.025]  And now, you've got the head of the EU, unelected heir of the Nazi empire.
[02:34:42.875 --> 02:34:47.337]  I mean, the Junkers were the number two most powerful group in Germany after Hitler.
[02:34:47.337 --> 02:34:51.399]  They owned the biggest factories, the Junker bombers, all of it.
[02:34:51.399 --> 02:34:55.041]  They took over European countries they still control today.
[02:34:55.041 --> 02:34:57.082]  Like Luxembourg.
[02:34:57.082 --> 02:35:02.924]  And when Trump got in, they said, we will remove your president, we will destroy your economy, we will defeat you.
[02:35:02.924 --> 02:35:04.905]  I was reading this stuff in January of this year.
[02:35:04.905 --> 02:35:06.626]  In February.
[02:35:08.032 --> 02:35:11.955]  The headlines were, you know, heir of the Nazis, Junkers, pledges to defeat Trump.
[02:35:11.955 --> 02:35:17.720]  And I said, listen, bro, your economy's going to implode, you're going to fail, and we're going to have massive growth rates.
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:18.941]  Watch.
[02:35:18.941 --> 02:35:19.622]  And it all happened.
[02:35:19.622 --> 02:35:22.845]  Because Trump's real.
[02:35:22.845 --> 02:35:26.208]  Let me tell you, their attacks on him are not feigned.
[02:35:26.208 --> 02:35:29.651]  Make no mistake, they're scared because it's the end.
[02:35:31.988 --> 02:35:34.108]  And we're not going to shovel them into their political grave.
[02:35:34.108 --> 02:35:37.229]  We're not going to kill them or put them in a FEMA camp like they want to do to us.
[02:35:37.229 --> 02:35:46.311]  We're just going to promote so much prosperity and so much classical liberalism that everybody turns around and says, how did we ever get enslaved by this jerk?
[02:35:46.311 --> 02:35:47.491]  You know, here's an idea.
[02:35:47.491 --> 02:35:56.693]  How about Luxembourg moves to find out why his family still hijacked it with the Nazis in 1943 and kick him out?
[02:35:56.693 --> 02:35:59.334]  How about he gets removed?
[02:35:59.334 --> 02:36:01.014]  How about Yonkers finds out?
[02:36:02.506 --> 02:36:04.747]  A lot of dead men at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:36:04.747 --> 02:36:06.228]  A lot of dead men in North Africa.
[02:36:06.228 --> 02:36:07.469]  A lot of dead men in Europe.
[02:36:07.469 --> 02:36:11.231]  And millions dead all over Eastern Europe and Russia.
[02:36:11.231 --> 02:36:16.553]  Because that piece of crap's family all thought they had a right to rule everybody!
[02:36:16.553 --> 02:36:18.254]  And you still think it!
[02:36:18.254 --> 02:36:22.657]  Well how about you pay for what you've done, you arrogant person!
[02:36:23.817 --> 02:36:29.740]  Yunker, I see you and I swear on the altar of God I'm gonna do whatever it takes to bring you down.
[02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:33.962]  You and your Islamic hordes and all the crap you pulled and your family.
[02:36:33.962 --> 02:36:41.286]  You've been a disease in Europe for 800 years!
[02:36:41.286 --> 02:36:44.568]  I pray to God to bring Yunker to justice.
[02:36:44.568 --> 02:36:46.469]  I pray God strike him down!
[02:36:48.424 --> 02:36:51.426]  He's an enemy of progress and humanity and everything good.
[02:36:51.426 --> 02:36:54.129]  He's a Nazi piece of crap!
[02:36:54.129 --> 02:36:58.092]  Allied with the dirtiest forms of Islam, and he's our enemy!
[02:36:58.092 --> 02:37:00.274]  He's your enemy of old!
[02:37:00.274 --> 02:37:02.255]  He was your grandfather's enemy!
[02:37:02.255 --> 02:37:04.037]  He was your great-grandfather's enemy!
[02:37:04.777 --> 02:37:09.361]  And he needs to know that if he wants a war, he's gonna get one!
[02:37:09.361 --> 02:37:11.062]  You think you're better than everybody?
[02:37:11.062 --> 02:37:14.605]  You think because we're not psychopaths like you, that we're not strong?
[02:37:14.605 --> 02:37:19.488]  You're gonna get it, you little chicken-neck, pseudo-intellectual piece of crap!
[02:37:19.488 --> 02:37:22.331]  Your anti-Christian garbage is coming to an end!
[02:37:22.331 --> 02:37:31.858]  I think everybody should pray that he be brought to justice, that God bring him low.
[02:37:31.858 --> 02:37:32.839]  Our enemies fear God.
[02:37:34.005 --> 02:37:43.411]  But you've got to ask God to intercess against Junker and all the rest of these people who are so drunk on our blood, it makes me sick!
[02:37:43.411 --> 02:37:53.197]  The fact that that inbred chicken-neck cowardly fop could be in control of civilization must end!
[02:37:53.197 --> 02:37:57.019]  Just look at that piece of crap, giving everything he's got.
[02:37:57.019 --> 02:37:59.921]  I said I'd be on your calls, excuse me.
[02:37:59.921 --> 02:38:02.102]  I'll spit on the table right now, I am genuinely
[02:38:05.976 --> 02:38:11.780]  Genuinely angry right now.
[02:38:11.780 --> 02:38:17.824]  He's a literal Nazi that wants to destroy our economy and bragged about it.
[02:38:17.824 --> 02:38:19.745]  You're supposed to get pissed off about that!
[02:38:19.745 --> 02:38:28.330]  I will not let that piece of trash... He claims he's an uber-menschen.
[02:38:28.330 --> 02:38:30.912]  You are a piece of crap, Dunker.
[02:38:32.677 --> 02:38:35.858]  And you'll see what our champion and what we do to you.
[02:38:35.858 --> 02:38:36.818]  You're weak.
[02:38:36.818 --> 02:38:38.038]  We're not.
[02:38:38.038 --> 02:38:39.159]  We love prosperity.
[02:38:39.159 --> 02:38:39.959]  We love freedom.
[02:38:39.959 --> 02:38:41.719]  You don't, scumbag.
[02:38:41.719 --> 02:38:48.781]  And when you sent your German paratroopers into Luxembourg to steal it for yourself, I want to know why he's still in control of Luxembourg!
[02:38:48.781 --> 02:38:53.142]  I want him stripped of his Nazi garbage!
[02:38:53.142 --> 02:38:56.883]  They're always messing with Switzerland because Nazis put their money in there and a bunch of other people did.
[02:38:56.883 --> 02:38:59.184]  Always messing with Switzerland because it stayed neutral.
[02:38:59.184 --> 02:39:02.005]  Junkers has the real Nazi money in Luxembourg.
[02:39:03.089 --> 02:39:05.191]  He's way richer than George Soros.
[02:39:05.191 --> 02:39:15.159]  In fact, George Soros, it's admitted, works for him, just like George Soros worked for Nazis rounding up Jews 65 years ago.
[02:39:15.159 --> 02:39:20.063]  You're looking at George Soros' daddy.
[02:39:20.063 --> 02:39:27.769]  George Soros is the slimy tentacle that comes out of the rear end of Yonkers and crams children in its spiritual mouth.
[02:39:33.274 --> 02:39:35.855]  That's Soros' controller right there.
[02:39:35.855 --> 02:39:38.015]  That's the real bad guy right there.
[02:39:38.015 --> 02:39:41.897]  That's the highest level scumbag willing to slither out of the rat hole.
[02:39:41.897 --> 02:39:48.939]  And just like you got your teeth kicked in in 1945, buddy, you're gonna get them kicked in right now.
[02:39:48.939 --> 02:39:53.200]  And how you fed on the German people and used them for your evil, wicked schemes.
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:55.901]  You and your family are trash.
[02:39:59.198 --> 02:40:03.022]  And they hate me because they know my spirit is one of victory and I will defeat you!
[02:40:03.022 --> 02:40:04.323]  God is gonna defeat you!
[02:40:04.323 --> 02:40:05.164]  We will get you!
[02:40:05.164 --> 02:40:05.705]  You understand?
[02:40:05.705 --> 02:40:08.488]  No matter what you do to us, in the end you're gonna fail!
[02:40:08.488 --> 02:40:09.188]  You understand that?
[02:40:09.188 --> 02:40:10.289]  We're gonna get you!
[02:40:10.289 --> 02:40:17.977]  Now let's go ahead and take the phone calls!
[02:40:17.977 --> 02:40:19.839]  Can't wait!
[02:40:19.839 --> 02:40:21.261]  We're this close!
[02:40:21.261 --> 02:40:22.242]  We're this close!
[02:40:24.699 --> 02:40:27.180]  Fee-fi-fo-fum.
[02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:29.961]  I smell the blood of a Nazi son!
[02:40:29.961 --> 02:40:37.144]  And be he alive, or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread!
[02:40:37.144 --> 02:40:42.446]  Alright, Aaron in Ohio.
[02:40:42.446 --> 02:40:45.627]  I'm going to everybody before I turn the baton over to the next guest host.
[02:40:45.627 --> 02:40:46.148]  Go ahead, Aaron.
[02:40:46.148 --> 02:40:46.628]  Thanks for holding.
[02:40:46.628 --> 02:40:47.528]  You're a tripper.
[02:40:47.528 --> 02:40:48.989]  Hey, how you doing, Alex, buddy?
[02:40:48.989 --> 02:40:50.029]  Good, brother.
[02:40:50.029 --> 02:40:51.810]  Hey, look, um, so...
[02:40:52.711 --> 02:41:02.998]  You know, I tried to tell my friends, real quick, before I get to my point, that Pete was an idiot because anything that George Soros is behind is not for the good of the people.
[02:41:02.998 --> 02:41:04.479]  I just kind of wanted to throw that in there.
[02:41:04.479 --> 02:41:15.206]  Yeah, George Soros calls Obama's net neutrality good and calls it racist if we don't let him and the new IMF, World Bank, UN, EU consortium run the internet.
[02:41:15.206 --> 02:41:16.747]  It's absolute crap!
[02:41:19.024 --> 02:41:39.358]  The point I wanted to make about the North Korea thing, and I could be totally off base here and I completely understand that, but something seemed very weird about that whole incident to me because supposedly they shot the guy who escaped from across the DMZ and there was no fire back at all or there was no repercussions for breaking the treaty there.
[02:41:40.504 --> 02:41:41.604]  It just kind of makes me wonder.
[02:41:41.604 --> 02:41:45.626]  Well, I've not been over there, and I've not been in the military, but I've studied it, and that happens a lot of the time.
[02:41:45.626 --> 02:41:47.226]  They grab the guy and drug him back.
[02:41:47.226 --> 02:41:50.868]  I mean, talking about the defector last week that barely survived, got shot five times.
[02:41:50.868 --> 02:41:51.348]  What do you think?
[02:41:51.348 --> 02:41:52.968]  I don't know.
[02:41:52.968 --> 02:41:55.849]  Sometimes it makes you wonder what we see on TV.
[02:41:55.849 --> 02:42:03.072]  How do we know this is not another golf of talking situation just to, you know, get the people against North Korea?
[02:42:03.072 --> 02:42:07.513]  Well, because that's the real DMZ right there, and I don't think the North Koreans will go along with that.
[02:42:07.513 --> 02:42:09.654]  I think they've said it was real, haven't they?
[02:42:10.825 --> 02:42:19.453]  Yeah, I mean, fair enough, but then again, they're under the control of the Communist Chinese, so we don't know if there's any deception in play there or not.
[02:42:19.453 --> 02:42:21.275]  Yeah, I think that's fair.
[02:42:21.275 --> 02:42:22.076]  You don't know what's true.
[02:42:22.076 --> 02:42:25.038]  You don't know what's real.
[02:42:25.038 --> 02:42:26.079]  Exactly.
[02:42:26.079 --> 02:42:28.402]  Anything else?
[02:42:28.402 --> 02:42:33.787]  There was one other thing, but I can't remember right now because I was just listening to you get pretty mad, and I love it.
[02:42:35.038 --> 02:42:41.003]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:43:04.668 --> 02:43:15.498]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:43:15.498 --> 02:43:17.619]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:43:17.619 --> 02:43:21.623]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:21.623 --> 02:43:22.824]  I want to thank everybody that has, but
[02:43:23.064 --> 02:43:31.250]  We've got the best chloride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:43:31.250 --> 02:43:33.891]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:43:33.891 --> 02:43:36.693]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:43:36.693 --> 02:43:39.175]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:43:39.175 --> 02:43:48.381]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:43:48.381 --> 02:43:52.804]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:43:56.027 --> 02:43:56.828]  I'm so excited.
[02:43:56.828 --> 02:44:06.974]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Pill.
[02:44:06.974 --> 02:44:12.478]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:44:12.478 --> 02:44:15.480]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:24.286]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:44:26.347 --> 02:44:45.964]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:44:45.964 --> 02:44:48.647]  It is amazing!
[02:44:48.647 --> 02:44:53.611]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:44:56.638 --> 02:45:01.160]  YouTube has a huge pedophile problem, and advertisers are starting to take note.
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:10.803]  YouTube is guilty of not removing content that promotes terrorism and extremism, and it was recently hit for not removing violent content from its YouTube Kids platform.
[02:45:10.803 --> 02:45:14.645]  Now YouTube is under fire for ignoring its own pedophile problem.
[02:45:14.645 --> 02:45:25.249]  A recent BuzzFeed report describes a vast, disturbing, and wildly popular universe of videos that include live action footage of children depicted in compromising situations.
[02:45:25.489 --> 02:45:36.495]  Big companies are now pulling advertising from YouTube after it was revealed that up to 100,000 predatory accounts have been leaving indecent comments on videos featuring children for at least a year.
[02:45:36.495 --> 02:45:45.681]  That's right, while the Google-owned platform has been censoring and demonetizing offensive political content for the last six months, pedophiles were completely left alone.
[02:45:46.101 --> 02:45:53.748]  Maybe YouTube should concentrate on cleaning its own house before declaring completely legitimate political content to be harmful or disturbing.
[02:45:56.954 --> 02:46:00.898]  Enjoy all natural bath and beauty products with Emmerich's Essentials.

[02:46:57.976 --> 02:47:00.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:21.042 --> 02:47:41.035]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:41.035 --> 02:47:44.737]  I'm like a baby in here today.
[02:47:44.737 --> 02:47:48.320]  I'm like flailing, spilling glasses of water, knocking food over during the breaks.
[02:47:49.827 --> 02:47:55.630]  Because there's just a quickening happening, and so much is going on, and so much news.
[02:47:55.630 --> 02:48:02.594]  It really is an incredible time to be alive, going right to your phone calls.
[02:48:02.594 --> 02:48:19.082]  When I think about Junckers, the dictator of the European Union, the unelected European Union, and the fact that he's a dictator, and that the bureaucracy that was just set up as a trade deal 60 years ago, with the Treaty of London,
[02:48:20.652 --> 02:48:37.282]  Now has the heir of the Nazi fortune, German royalty, sitting on top of the unelected EU, and then right after Trump got elected and got into office, Jokers said, don't worry, we'll stop Trump's recovery, we'll stop his agenda in America.
[02:48:37.282 --> 02:48:38.883]  He said that.
[02:48:38.883 --> 02:48:41.524]  And then he did it through Soros, but failed.
[02:48:41.524 --> 02:48:43.165]  I mean, it's outrageous.
[02:48:43.165 --> 02:48:47.148]  This guy is arrogant, but he's gotten away with taking over whole countries.
[02:48:48.547 --> 02:48:50.268]  He's gotten away with whatever he wants.
[02:48:50.268 --> 02:48:52.310]  The guy's worth trillions of dollars.
[02:48:52.310 --> 02:48:56.532]  The richest people in the world, folks, aren't these billionaires and hundred billionaires.
[02:48:56.532 --> 02:48:59.274]  They're just minions of guys like Juncker.
[02:48:59.274 --> 02:49:04.518]  So I physically get angry and physically get disgusted by this pig-like creature.
[02:49:06.533 --> 02:49:11.197]  When he's in the news today, EU president without millions of African migrants, Europe will be lost.
[02:49:11.197 --> 02:49:15.281]  Then they bring him in, turn him against Europe, brainwash him, make him communist.
[02:49:15.281 --> 02:49:18.303]  Jean-Claude Juncker, migrants need legal ways to come to Europe.
[02:49:18.303 --> 02:49:19.805]  He already brought 10 million in.
[02:49:19.805 --> 02:49:24.509]  Macron blames African traffickers for Libyan slave trade.
[02:49:24.509 --> 02:49:25.730]  That's the Muslims doing it!
[02:49:28.342 --> 02:49:32.245]  Trump retweets videos of alleged attacks by Muslims.
[02:49:32.245 --> 02:49:34.927]  It's like Muslims throwing gays off buildings.
[02:49:34.927 --> 02:49:36.207]  None of it's even debated.
[02:49:36.207 --> 02:49:40.390]  Even Fox News said, oh, it's alleged because, you know, Muslims never do anything.
[02:49:40.390 --> 02:49:44.133]  We show this dry one of some Muslim beating up a guy that's on crutches.
[02:49:44.133 --> 02:49:50.217]  How about we show the gay guy getting thrown off the bridge or little girls getting tortured?
[02:49:50.217 --> 02:49:55.901]  The point is their whole system's failing because you're aware of it, you know what's going on, you understand.
[02:49:55.901 --> 02:49:57.182]  And the minute you're aware, it's over.
[02:49:58.868 --> 02:50:00.770]  We have great products that fund our operation.
[02:50:00.770 --> 02:50:04.675]  Without you buying the products at InfoWarsTore.com, we can't fund our operation.
[02:50:04.675 --> 02:50:05.736]  And the globalists win.
[02:50:05.736 --> 02:50:12.024]  We got great supplements, great books, great videos, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great water filtration, air filtration.
[02:50:12.024 --> 02:50:14.006]  All the best systems at very low prices.
[02:50:14.006 --> 02:50:15.488]  Free shipping's about to end.
[02:50:15.488 --> 02:50:17.690]  We're expanding Cyber Monday for a few days.
[02:50:18.271 --> 02:50:18.371]  It's
[02:50:37.225 --> 02:50:37.906]  We're good to go.
[02:51:02.657 --> 02:51:03.318]  is amazing.
[02:51:03.318 --> 02:51:04.278]  Be sure and check that out.
[02:51:04.278 --> 02:51:05.219]  So thank you all.
[02:51:05.219 --> 02:51:07.060]  Okay, I'm gonna stop plugging.
[02:51:07.060 --> 02:51:09.682]  Let's be judicial now, or judicious as they say.
[02:51:09.682 --> 02:51:12.104]  Let's try to get to as many calls as possible.
[02:51:12.104 --> 02:51:13.285]  Joe in New Jersey.
[02:51:13.285 --> 02:51:17.928]  We got Dr. Colette from North Carolina.
[02:51:17.928 --> 02:51:22.471]  Mike, everybody, let's go to Dr. Colette calling in from North Carolina.
[02:51:22.471 --> 02:51:22.891]  You're on the air.
[02:51:22.891 --> 02:51:23.432]  Thanks for holding.
[02:51:24.090 --> 02:51:24.830]  Hello?
[02:51:24.830 --> 02:51:25.651]  Hi.
[02:51:25.651 --> 02:51:26.191]  Hi.
[02:51:26.191 --> 02:51:27.452]  How are you?
[02:51:27.452 --> 02:51:28.892]  I am good.
[02:51:28.892 --> 02:51:29.473]  Good.
[02:51:29.473 --> 02:51:36.876]  On calling, I can either discuss pedophilia or North Korea, however... Well, just so you know, I don't really screen calls.
[02:51:36.876 --> 02:51:39.717]  Everybody always gets on air and then kind of tries to screen the call.
[02:51:39.717 --> 02:51:42.018]  You're on air right now, so cover whatever you'd like.
[02:51:42.018 --> 02:51:43.119]  You called in about North Korea.
[02:51:43.843 --> 02:51:49.846]  Right, well, I listen to music a lot, and I watch videos a lot, and that's my entertainment.
[02:51:49.846 --> 02:51:58.691]  So do I. This morning, I was cruising through YouTube, and I was listening to music, and I saw North Korea.
[02:51:58.691 --> 02:52:04.594]  And I have posted this on my Twitter account, and, well, I don't know if I should give my last name.
[02:52:04.594 --> 02:52:05.875]  Well, we're not screening your call.
[02:52:05.875 --> 02:52:07.536]  If you want to say your Twitter account, it's up to you.
[02:52:07.536 --> 02:52:08.136]  If not, don't.
[02:52:08.806 --> 02:52:09.266]  Hey, go ahead.
[02:52:09.266 --> 02:52:10.027]  Let's do it.
[02:52:10.027 --> 02:52:17.691]  It's I'm Dr. Colette Dowell and my Twitter account is Colette with a bottom dash.
[02:52:17.691 --> 02:52:18.771]  OK.
[02:52:18.771 --> 02:52:23.914]  It's in the videos posted on the top because I retweeted it.
[02:52:23.914 --> 02:52:27.196]  And it's North Korea culture music video.
[02:52:27.196 --> 02:52:28.416]  Oh, wow.
[02:52:28.416 --> 02:52:29.157]  Weird.
[02:52:29.157 --> 02:52:31.438]  Must be propaganda.
[02:52:31.438 --> 02:52:33.859]  New North Korean music video.
[02:52:33.859 --> 02:52:37.201]  Without North Korea, there is no Earth.
[02:52:39.605 --> 02:52:40.906]  Hillary is our leader.
[02:52:40.906 --> 02:52:43.128]  Thank you for the call.
[02:52:43.128 --> 02:52:44.629]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:44.629 --> 02:52:46.570]  Down in North Korea, there is no Earth.
[02:52:46.570 --> 02:52:48.352]  That'll be like a quote from Alex Jones, they'll say.
[02:52:48.352 --> 02:52:57.078]  Because whatever the callers say on the show, the news, like if a caller says there's Martian moon bases, they say I said it, even though I didn't.
[02:52:57.078 --> 02:53:00.040]  So, thank you, ma'am.
[02:53:00.040 --> 02:53:02.322]  I appreciate that, doctor.
[02:53:02.322 --> 02:53:04.384]  Doctor, doctor, doctor.
[02:53:04.384 --> 02:53:05.885]  Kind of like in Spies Like Us.
[02:53:07.714 --> 02:53:09.595]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:53:09.595 --> 02:53:12.356]  Joe in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:53:12.356 --> 02:53:13.137]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:53:13.137 --> 02:53:14.277]  Good, brother.
[02:53:14.277 --> 02:53:19.079]  I should say, silver bullet, nascent iodine, deep cleanse, all great product, man.
[02:53:19.079 --> 02:53:19.540]  All great product.
[02:53:19.540 --> 02:53:20.800]  Thank you.
[02:53:20.800 --> 02:53:31.806]  What I want to say about North Korea is, though, you know, they established this ICBM pretty quickly, and from what, from the range that they were shooting before, and I know Trump said he's not playing any games, and I really believe him.
[02:53:31.806 --> 02:53:33.306]  Huge Trump supporter.
[02:53:33.306 --> 02:53:33.847]  But, you know,
[02:53:35.253 --> 02:53:37.696]  They really, even though they can hit anywhere in the U.S.
[02:53:37.696 --> 02:53:43.423]  that they're saying now, and I know a nuclear warhead is a little bit heavier, they can still hit that West Coast.
[02:53:43.423 --> 02:53:44.484]  So, you know, I hope.
[02:53:45.290 --> 02:53:48.091]  They're not going to wait too long, and I don't want to see any war.
[02:53:48.091 --> 02:53:51.473]  Let me just tell you, don't worry about their missiles and their bases.
[02:53:51.473 --> 02:53:53.093]  That can all be blown up on the ground.
[02:53:53.093 --> 02:53:56.275]  Don't worry about Russia and China if this happens.
[02:53:56.275 --> 02:53:57.895]  Everything is Russia and China.
[02:53:57.895 --> 02:53:59.116]  Everything is that.
[02:53:59.116 --> 02:54:03.118]  If they're going to attack Seoul with 100,000 pieces of artillery, they're going to get nuked.
[02:54:03.118 --> 02:54:08.280]  And Matt, after I talked about this, you'll notice they said, we're going to have to strike the whole DMZ and just take them out.
[02:54:12.412 --> 02:54:25.255]  I think they're manipulating North Korea into a provocation, and I support Trump on every other issue, and I'm not saying I don't support him on this, because he's got more information than I have, but North Korea is in the crosshairs right now.
[02:54:25.255 --> 02:54:30.417]  Nuclear weapons are all aimed at them, and they're going to vaporize those people.
[02:54:30.417 --> 02:54:36.958]  Is it good for generations to keep getting used as cattle and enslaved, or good if a third of them end up getting killed to end up getting the rest of them freed?
[02:54:41.394 --> 02:54:47.760]  Well, I guess the word to use would be the German philosopher Nishi-type equation.
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:52.204]  But are we just going to sit here while they keep threatening to attack Japan or South Korea or everybody else?
[02:54:52.204 --> 02:54:57.208]  I mean, they've got a gun pointed saying, we're going to destroy America, we're going to attack first, you're all dead, we're going to kill you.
[02:54:57.208 --> 02:54:58.309]  How long are we going to sit here and take it?
[02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:59.990]  And I'm not looking for a nuclear war.
[02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:01.212]  They could trigger a bigger one.
[02:55:01.212 --> 02:55:02.913]  I want this to de-escalate.
[02:55:02.913 --> 02:55:05.155]  I mean, North Korea could come in out of the dark.
[02:55:05.155 --> 02:55:06.276]  They could work with the West.
[02:55:06.276 --> 02:55:07.297]  They could get everything fixed.
[02:55:07.297 --> 02:55:08.078]  They don't want that.
[02:55:08.638 --> 02:55:13.980]  They got a little fat demon guy that actually thinks he's God, waddling around in charge of everything.
[02:55:13.980 --> 02:55:16.561]  That'd be okay if he was a McDonald's manager, but he's not.
[02:55:16.561 --> 02:55:21.523]  Okay, how long is, you know, Trump and, well, the U.S.
[02:55:21.523 --> 02:55:25.025]  as a whole going to take this of him just shooting these missiles?
[02:55:25.025 --> 02:55:29.126]  Eventually he's going to want to shoot somewhere on land, whether it be Japan, Hawaii, the West Coast.
[02:55:29.126 --> 02:55:30.607]  But don't you think he's manly?
[02:55:30.607 --> 02:55:31.427]  Isn't he handsome?
[02:55:31.427 --> 02:55:34.648]  I mean, he just looks like a, imagine, I mean, he could take on Brock Lesnar.
[02:55:34.648 --> 02:55:35.709]  I mean, he's powerful.
[02:55:36.784 --> 02:55:38.387]  He kind of looks like a three-year-old.
[02:55:38.387 --> 02:55:39.608]  Just put him in diapers, you know?
[02:55:39.608 --> 02:55:41.972]  He looks like a giant demonic vampire.
[02:55:41.972 --> 02:55:45.096]  A little toddler vampire.
[02:55:45.096 --> 02:55:45.998]  He really does.
[02:55:45.998 --> 02:55:49.463]  And it's terrible somebody like that can actually run a country, you know?
[02:55:49.463 --> 02:55:50.484]  Only with communism!
[02:55:51.232 --> 02:55:55.734]  I mean, he couldn't... Kim Jong-un couldn't be a toilet attendant.
[02:55:55.734 --> 02:55:57.894]  Kim Jong-un couldn't tie his own shoelaces.
[02:55:57.894 --> 02:56:01.736]  But he's the third generation dictator in the open communist wonderland.
[02:56:01.736 --> 02:56:02.776]  It's always a dictatorship.
[02:56:02.776 --> 02:56:05.297]  It's always some hereditary deal because communism is so cool.
[02:56:05.297 --> 02:56:09.218]  And then all these spoiled rotten brats that go to university want to live under communism.
[02:56:09.218 --> 02:56:18.081]  I think they all ought to load their Antifa butts up and go to North Korea right now and get some forced labor camp stuff and eat some human flesh and eat some upper party feces.
[02:56:18.081 --> 02:56:20.482]  That's what the lower level people eat, the feces of the upper party.
[02:56:20.842 --> 02:56:25.792]  I just think the liberals should all go to North Korea and just learn to live in slave camps and just eat crap.
[02:56:25.792 --> 02:56:26.433]  Wouldn't they like that?
[02:56:27.384 --> 02:56:35.570]  Absolutely, because you know, they've been living like this for what, three generations and no one, there's never been a protest or anything because they're afraid, they're so brainwashed.
[02:56:35.570 --> 02:56:47.740]  So I think Trump ought to set up a deal where people that want to extradite themselves, you know, waive their citizenship, that we can have an express paid for, first class tickets to North Korea, but you're not allowed to come back.
[02:56:47.740 --> 02:56:52.163]  I'm serious, I would offer all the leftists, all the antifa, an express ticket.
[02:56:52.163 --> 02:56:53.004]  In fact, I will say,
[02:56:54.212 --> 02:57:02.794]  As long as it's not a tourist visa, that you're going to renounce your citizenship, to move to North Korea, that I'm willing, as exploratory, to pay for the first ten people.
[02:57:02.794 --> 02:57:05.615]  I think Michael Moore ought to go there as well.
[02:57:05.615 --> 02:57:07.296]  You can see one person do it.
[02:57:07.296 --> 02:57:08.156]  Oh, absolutely not.
[02:57:08.156 --> 02:57:10.256]  They're going to stay here as parasites feeding on us.
[02:57:10.256 --> 02:57:12.057]  Absolutely.
[02:57:12.057 --> 02:57:15.378]  They just see Kim Jong-un as a fellow parasite.
[02:57:15.378 --> 02:57:21.739]  The question is, though, like, are little Kim Jong-il's like little ticks all over the belly of Michael Moore?
[02:57:21.739 --> 02:57:23.060]  Because there's a theory that
[02:57:24.164 --> 02:57:31.591]  Kim Jong-un actually, his mother is Michael Moore, and that he suckled Michael Moore.
[02:57:31.591 --> 02:57:32.592]  That's satire, my friend.
[02:57:32.592 --> 02:57:33.013]  I'm joking.
[02:57:33.013 --> 02:57:34.014]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:57:34.014 --> 02:57:38.438]  We're gonna come back, go to Dan, Colt, Christian, Mike, and others straight ahead.

[03:00:09.846 --> 03:00:28.159]  Roger Stone and Laura Loomer who confronted Linda Saussure, the younger Soros dropping.
[03:00:28.159 --> 03:00:30.300]  She'll be joining us coming up in the next segment with Roger Stone.
[03:00:30.300 --> 03:00:31.261]  Right now we're taking your calls.
[03:00:33.393 --> 03:00:37.354]  Let's go ahead and talk to Christian in Houston, Texas.
[03:00:37.354 --> 03:00:38.355]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:38.355 --> 03:00:39.555]  I really appreciate you doing that.
[03:00:39.555 --> 03:00:41.916]  Go ahead.
[03:00:41.916 --> 03:00:42.676]  Hi.
[03:00:42.676 --> 03:00:47.417]  I've been a fan for quite a long time.
[03:00:47.417 --> 03:00:52.139]  I wanted to talk about the vaccines.
[03:00:52.139 --> 03:00:55.480]  Yes, ma'am.
[03:00:55.480 --> 03:00:58.521]  I believe I've been affected by it because
[03:01:03.382 --> 03:01:07.425]  I have this thing called polycystic ovarian syndrome.
[03:01:07.425 --> 03:01:14.110]  Did you take the Gardasil shot?
[03:01:14.110 --> 03:01:15.131]  Yeah.
[03:01:15.131 --> 03:01:19.634]  Sadly, my grandparents made me do it.
[03:01:19.634 --> 03:01:20.415]  So how old are you?
[03:01:20.415 --> 03:01:20.635]  About 20?
[03:01:20.635 --> 03:01:20.715]  Yeah.
[03:01:24.585 --> 03:01:29.928]  The average trendy would ask how I know all that, because I know the numbers, I know the dates and the histories.
[03:01:29.928 --> 03:01:32.949]  I know which vaccine out of over 300 does that.
[03:01:32.949 --> 03:01:35.050]  I'm sorry that UN project hit you.
[03:01:35.050 --> 03:01:51.879]  Ma'am, it's 100% fact that it was a UN eugenics program, was tested in Texas, has been deployed against six Latin American countries right now, and is what they call a soft sterilant, and that it doesn't affect everyone.
[03:01:52.939 --> 03:01:58.186]  It depends on how the genetic mutagen has the effect according to the top scientists we've interviewed on the subject.
[03:01:58.186 --> 03:02:02.312]  But absolutely, you know why Rick Perry said it was the law to take it, which it wasn't.
[03:02:02.312 --> 03:02:03.874]  He just meant it was mandated.
[03:02:03.874 --> 03:02:09.541]  So the state health department, if that happens, it kicks in the vaccine damage fund federally and at the UN.
[03:02:10.442 --> 03:02:21.329]  So that they could dump that weapon on the market and hit girls between ages 10 and 12, about 8-9 years ago, with the bioweapon.
[03:02:21.329 --> 03:02:26.452]  And so that is a bioweapon you were hit with, and I'm very sorry to hear that.
[03:02:26.452 --> 03:02:33.997]  Okay, and also, I hope we don't go into like a Hunger Games or
[03:02:35.003 --> 03:02:36.685]  Divergent type government.
[03:02:50.859 --> 03:02:55.182]  So let me ask you, did you have a big fever, an autoimmune response, any convulsions?
[03:02:55.182 --> 03:02:57.023]  Or did it just happen once you went into puberty?
[03:02:57.023 --> 03:03:06.490]  Because it's directly linked with ovarian cancers and a bunch of other forms of sterilization.
[03:03:06.490 --> 03:03:07.211]  Can you tell them?
[03:03:07.211 --> 03:03:11.033]  Because they actually inject you with non-attenuated virus.
[03:03:11.033 --> 03:03:17.978]  Well, I noticed that I started growing facial hair and stuff like that.
[03:03:23.506 --> 03:03:28.570]  And I went to the doctor and they diagnosed me with it.
[03:03:28.570 --> 03:03:29.571]  Wow.
[03:03:29.571 --> 03:03:30.972]  Well, you know, that's how I knew.
[03:03:30.972 --> 03:03:34.794]  That vaccine's directly linked to that in the trials.
[03:03:34.794 --> 03:03:37.677]  Yeah.
[03:03:37.677 --> 03:03:44.161]  You know, and the funny thing about it is I can show somebody an insert and they won't read it, but if I can guess, that kind of impresses people.
[03:03:44.161 --> 03:03:45.903]  And I don't want to impress them for me.
[03:03:45.903 --> 03:03:47.704]  I want them to read about Gardasil.
[03:03:47.704 --> 03:03:50.406]  Did you know that India and Japan have banned Gardasil?
[03:03:53.615 --> 03:03:59.060]  Did you get red spots or any type of hives on your body after the vaccine?
[03:03:59.060 --> 03:04:10.191]  Not that I can remember, but... Well, as sad as this is, Christian, you know, a lot of women, young girls, have convulsions after being given it, and quite a few die.
[03:04:10.191 --> 03:04:14.375]  Have you search-engined Gardasil deaths or Gardasil adverse reactions?
[03:04:16.393 --> 03:04:32.384]  I researched the link between polycystic ovarian syndrome and it said some girls experience irregular cycles afterwards.
[03:04:34.600 --> 03:04:35.961]  It's very special.
[03:04:35.961 --> 03:04:39.463]  We're not sure exactly how it all works, but it's something else.
[03:04:39.463 --> 03:04:42.224]  By the way, the vaccine insert says it doesn't protect you from HPV.
[03:04:42.224 --> 03:04:46.987]  So the argument is, oh, you do this because it'll protect you, and of course it doesn't protect you.
[03:04:46.987 --> 03:04:47.747]  I'm very sorry.
[03:04:47.747 --> 03:04:49.488]  I hope you get better.
[03:04:49.488 --> 03:04:50.329]  We'll pray for you.
[03:04:54.713 --> 03:05:06.166]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[03:05:06.166 --> 03:05:13.215]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[03:05:13.655 --> 03:05:13.855]  I think?
[03:05:32.361 --> 03:05:39.346]  Cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[03:05:39.346 --> 03:05:45.210]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[03:05:45.210 --> 03:05:54.237]  When you purchase it at m4wrestore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:05:58.807 --> 03:06:01.108]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:06:01.108 --> 03:06:03.630]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[03:06:03.630 --> 03:06:05.731]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:05.731 --> 03:06:09.713]  Here's a surprise.
[03:06:09.713 --> 03:06:14.316]  Let me see you too, jerks.
[03:06:14.316 --> 03:06:21.840]  Look at all the pedophile rings, the rape rings, the satanic rings are all coming out.
[03:06:21.840 --> 03:06:26.782]  The globalism, the Europe allied with the radical islams.
[03:06:26.782 --> 03:06:27.723]  The radical islamists.
[03:06:29.275 --> 03:06:31.176]  Notice how all that's coming out now.
[03:06:31.176 --> 03:06:32.856]  Well, don't worry.
[03:06:32.856 --> 03:06:52.924]  It'll be a day late, a dollar short, but just like they injected Native Americans and black people and poor whites with live syphilis for 45 years, and they shot up Peruvians and Mexicans with it too, and people in Eastern Europe, you name it, and the radiation testing and all of it.
[03:06:52.924 --> 03:06:56.145]  It's gonna come out about the vaccines and what they've been adding to them.
[03:06:57.145 --> 03:06:58.326]  They even hide it in plain view.
[03:06:58.326 --> 03:07:18.696]  I remember about a year after the HPV vaccine, they were in the news in medical reports going, oh, the year before we released it as a simulant of H1N1, an attenuated virus in the vaccine, but it wasn't attenuated in the term of radiating it and breaking the virus so that it could replicate its protein chain of RNA.
[03:07:18.696 --> 03:07:20.277]  We left it alive.
[03:07:20.277 --> 03:07:23.158]  We just attenuated it so it wouldn't be more deadly.
[03:07:23.158 --> 03:07:25.179]  And then scientists ask, well, how'd you do that?
[03:07:25.179 --> 03:07:26.500]  Oh, we're not gonna, that's proprietary.
[03:07:27.912 --> 03:07:31.214]  So they actually introduced that flu.
[03:07:31.214 --> 03:07:34.636]  So you have to understand, they mean bidness.
[03:07:34.636 --> 03:07:36.117]  Bidness.
[03:07:36.117 --> 03:07:44.001]  And anybody that trusts anything coming out of Big Pharma is insane.
[03:07:44.001 --> 03:07:57.029]  The Clintons, back when they were governor, co-governor, they were the only state in the Union that would allow prison blood be sold out of the prisons
[03:07:58.029 --> 03:08:03.753]  And then they would have it certified as clean, even though they knew every group of blood had HIV and hepatitis in it.
[03:08:03.753 --> 03:08:05.914]  And it turned out Bayer Pharmaceutical knew about it.
[03:08:05.914 --> 03:08:07.135]  This is all public news, by the way.
[03:08:07.135 --> 03:08:08.415]  If you're new listeners, it's not my opinion.
[03:08:08.415 --> 03:08:09.836]  This is all admitted.
[03:08:09.836 --> 03:08:21.463]  And they had Factor VIII and all the rest of it, and they shipped it out, and then they had the corporate minutes in Australia and France of the Bayer executives saying, so what?
[03:08:21.463 --> 03:08:22.044]  Ship it out.
[03:08:22.044 --> 03:08:23.325]  Hemophiliacs are a burden.
[03:08:23.325 --> 03:08:26.026]  Kill them.
[03:08:26.026 --> 03:08:27.007]  So you just remember that.
[03:08:28.305 --> 03:08:28.645]  Remember that?
[03:08:28.645 --> 03:08:32.827]  They'll sit around those executives, makes them feel real big.
[03:08:32.827 --> 03:08:36.009]  Like, sure, all the blood's contaminated.
[03:08:36.009 --> 03:08:38.550]  You think I didn't know that?
[03:08:38.550 --> 03:08:42.993]  Too many hemophiliacs.
[03:08:42.993 --> 03:08:51.017]  Oh, but if somebody was to go to those executives' houses, which I'm not calling for, and line them up and chop them up with machetes, oh, it'd be all over the news.
[03:08:51.017 --> 03:08:54.359]  The poor sweet little executive got chopped up with a machete.
[03:08:54.359 --> 03:08:56.420]  Because, see, they're a human, we're just animals.
[03:08:57.898 --> 03:09:00.580]  The bank executives, wow, they've got rights!
[03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:10.868]  They're somebody, but you... You're gonna take the vaccine, you're gonna die, you're gonna be diseased, and you're not a person.
[03:09:10.868 --> 03:09:14.191]  Alright, we're gonna go to Roger Stone right now.
[03:09:14.191 --> 03:09:16.273]  He's got Laura Loomer coming up in the next segment.
[03:09:17.113 --> 03:09:34.793]  I had a bunch of callers I said I'd get to but I just we got Dan and Colton Mike and we should get their numbers I should call them tomorrow and have them back on a special guest so I don't want to promise to go to calls and not get to them all but Roger you've got a full plate but I gotta tell you 3.3 growth rate something never said what happened they said it's impossible to go 3%
[03:09:36.377 --> 03:09:39.199]  Trump says investigate Scarborough over death of intern.
[03:09:39.199 --> 03:09:41.761]  That's Infowars.com exclusive.
[03:09:41.761 --> 03:09:43.962]  The head of the EU says, yeah, we're going to flood you with Muslims.
[03:09:43.962 --> 03:09:45.043]  Europeans are bad.
[03:09:45.043 --> 03:09:45.524]  He's quoted.
[03:09:45.524 --> 03:09:46.104]  He's a Nazi.
[03:09:46.104 --> 03:09:47.105]  It's just totally bizarre.
[03:09:47.105 --> 03:09:49.987]  I guess Nazis like to exterminate groups of people.
[03:09:49.987 --> 03:09:58.253]  We've just got all this Matt Lauer collapsing, the whole power structure getting rid of all these reporters that have failed, using old sexual harassment cases they sat on.
[03:09:58.253 --> 03:10:01.095]  Trump says go after the head of NBC that he's really the top target.
[03:10:01.095 --> 03:10:01.395]  I agree.
[03:10:01.755 --> 03:10:04.220]  We're the executives getting in trouble on mere allegations.
[03:10:04.220 --> 03:10:05.543]  I'm not defending Lauer.
[03:10:05.543 --> 03:10:07.768]  What a time to be alive, my friend.
[03:10:07.768 --> 03:10:09.753]  This is truly amazing.
[03:10:09.753 --> 03:10:11.997]  What's the next shoe to drop, Roger Stone?
[03:10:13.649 --> 03:10:30.485]  Well, Alex, it's interesting that mainstream media is literally going out of their minds over the fact that Donald Trump this morning tweeted a video, a link to a video, regarding Islamic terrorists killing a Dutchman who was in crutches.
[03:10:30.485 --> 03:10:36.251]  He also took a good solid shot at his nemesis, Joe Scarborough.
[03:10:36.815 --> 03:10:43.698]  There'll be more on the Joe Scarborough story coming out and we'll bring it to you here first at InfoWars.
[03:10:43.698 --> 03:10:52.462]  But it is interesting to me, Alex, that the president acts very Trumpian after a refreshing weekend in Palm Beach.
[03:10:53.623 --> 03:11:10.980]  As you know, we reported here at InfoWars that General John Kelly, according to Vanity Fair, had a tight plan to block access to the President during his arrest period in Palm Beach, and that the President wouldn't be able to go to the main dining room.
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:19.764]  Well, my sources tell me he was holding court in the main dining room, talking to friends old and new.
[03:11:19.764 --> 03:11:26.928]  And when he came back to the job, he was on the attack through his Twitter feed.
[03:11:26.928 --> 03:11:35.112]  The entire media is now scratching their heads as to why the president is being Trump.
[03:11:35.112 --> 03:11:37.213]  They ask me, what's his strategy?
[03:11:37.213 --> 03:11:39.094]  What Machiavellian play is this?
[03:11:39.734 --> 03:11:41.455]  No Machiavellian play.
[03:11:41.455 --> 03:11:42.896]  Donald Trump's the real thing.
[03:11:42.896 --> 03:11:45.118]  He's the genuine article.
[03:11:45.118 --> 03:11:52.422]  He had no problem taking a shot at Joe Scarborough because Scarborough's taken numerous shots at him.
[03:11:52.422 --> 03:11:55.544]  This is the Donald Trump that we elected.
[03:11:55.544 --> 03:12:01.448]  He is exalting over the firing of Matt Lauer and he is on offense.
[03:12:02.068 --> 03:12:09.313]  That's right, Matt Lauer going along with the made-up PPGate, going along with the made-up, you know, edited tape about grabbing by the whatever.
[03:12:09.313 --> 03:12:12.936]  Meanwhile, Trump retweets video of alleged attacks on Muslims.
[03:12:12.936 --> 03:12:14.698]  Fox News even acts like it's alleged.
[03:12:14.698 --> 03:12:17.580]  These are documented, real known cases.
[03:12:17.580 --> 03:12:20.242]  Again, throwing gays off buildings, you name it.
[03:12:20.242 --> 03:12:29.789]  They have totally jumped the shark, and they're demonizing him for the big taboo, because all the murders, all the bombings, all the shootings, all the attacks, they never say it's Islamic.
[03:12:30.149 --> 03:12:34.742]  He has broken the carton rule to talk about our Lord and Saviors, the Islamicists.
[03:12:36.263 --> 03:12:43.068]  Well, and Alex, I had calls today from working reporters at the Washington Post, at Politico.
[03:12:43.068 --> 03:12:46.892]  They all want to know, where did the President get these links?
[03:12:46.892 --> 03:12:48.413]  The links are online!
[03:12:48.413 --> 03:12:55.378]  The President's capable of having someone go online and find it for him, if he's heard about it, or find it himself.
[03:12:55.378 --> 03:13:00.542]  And it is interesting to me the way he continues to confound his critics.
[03:13:02.077 --> 03:13:21.106]  New York Times has reported that he is bringing the NBC Billy Bush tape into question, at least its authenticity, and that privately he has continued to express some concerns about the President's birth certificate.
[03:13:21.106 --> 03:13:23.247]  I have not heard him say either one.
[03:13:23.849 --> 03:13:35.993]  I don't know anyone that he has said either one, two, but I do know the reporters in question, and I believe that they do have some solid sources.
[03:13:35.993 --> 03:13:45.395]  For those in the race, in the base, it shows that Donald Trump is still Donald Trump.
[03:13:45.395 --> 03:13:47.036]  We're getting Laura Limmer on the line right now.
[03:13:47.036 --> 03:13:50.917]  She's got a conversation with Sir coming up, but the fact that
[03:13:52.554 --> 03:14:04.518]  These are all known video clips that have already been confirmed, throwing the gays off the buildings, beating the Dutch man to death, doing all this to imply that Islam, you know, when they go to the bathroom, flowers come out.
[03:14:04.518 --> 03:14:07.459]  I mean, the media acting like, oh, Trump's done it now.
[03:14:07.459 --> 03:14:10.600]  That shows this is what he should be doing every day.
[03:14:10.600 --> 03:14:11.901]  Whatever they say, don't do.
[03:14:11.901 --> 03:14:13.461]  Whatever they say is discrediting.
[03:14:13.461 --> 03:14:14.141]  It's the opposite.
[03:14:14.141 --> 03:14:15.542]  Whatever they say, you should do the opposite.
[03:14:16.755 --> 03:14:21.498]  Well, we've had a siege change that was unthinkable under Barack Obama.
[03:14:21.498 --> 03:14:26.182]  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton wouldn't admit that Islamic terrorism even existed.
[03:14:26.182 --> 03:14:27.523]  It's a new day.
[03:14:27.523 --> 03:14:29.744]  There's a new sheriff in town.
[03:14:29.744 --> 03:14:36.029]  And the videos that the president sent are consistent with his policies on destroying ISIS.
[03:14:36.029 --> 03:14:36.469]  That's right.
[03:14:36.469 --> 03:14:37.590]  You're coming up.
[03:14:37.590 --> 03:14:40.071]  There she is, Laura Loomer, right there on screen.
[03:14:40.071 --> 03:14:42.293]  Briefly, folks, free shipping's going to have to end tomorrow.
[03:14:42.293 --> 03:14:44.034]  It's been going on for a week and a half.
[03:14:44.034 --> 03:14:45.896]  We got 50% off on a bunch of the best-selling
[03:14:47.182 --> 03:14:47.623]  I don't know.
[03:15:00.512 --> 03:15:02.673]  Or 888-253-3139.
[03:15:02.673 --> 03:15:05.554]  And I want to thank you all for building InfoWars.
[03:15:05.554 --> 03:15:07.534]  I want to thank you all for being the victory.
[03:15:07.534 --> 03:15:11.276]  I don't want to just thank Roger, Laura, or you.
[03:15:11.276 --> 03:15:15.637]  All of us together, the crew that puts up with me, because it's not an act what I'm doing here on air.
[03:15:15.637 --> 03:15:20.599]  I mean, I'm a maniac, because not in personal life, but when I deal with this stuff, I mean, this is war.
[03:15:20.599 --> 03:15:23.820]  So InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:25.900]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[03:15:25.900 --> 03:15:32.123]  A bunch of specials have already had to end because we sold out of some of our best-selling items, but there's a bunch of stuff left.
[03:15:32.123 --> 03:15:38.785]  Silver Bullet, Brain Force, Survival Shield, Super Mail, Knockout, the new Red Pill, even though it's a brand new product, 50% off.
[03:15:38.785 --> 03:15:41.246]  I want you to see how great it is.
[03:15:41.246 --> 03:15:43.046]  Brain Force, you name it, and free shipping.
[03:15:43.046 --> 03:15:45.307]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:15:45.307 --> 03:15:52.630]  Coming up, Laura Loomer stood up one of the Islamic dirtbags in America, one of the biggest pieces of filth.

[03:16:55.106 --> 03:16:57.568]  ID Stronghold wallets are different.

[03:17:07.057 --> 03:17:09.439]  And it doesn't sing when you open it.
[03:17:09.439 --> 03:17:11.541]  But it does have magical powers.

[03:18:06.445 --> 03:18:11.949]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:18:11.949 --> 03:18:14.951]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:18:14.951 --> 03:18:23.737]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:18:25.818 --> 03:18:45.415]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:18:45.415 --> 03:18:48.118]  It is amazing!
[03:18:48.118 --> 03:18:53.082]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:19:00.114 --> 03:19:00.875]  We're good to go!
[03:19:29.014 --> 03:19:29.354]  I think so.
[03:19:56.565 --> 03:20:15.917]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.917 --> 03:20:20.840]  Hi, this is former mayor and the greatest mayor, Mr. 9-11 Rudy Giuliani.
[03:20:20.840 --> 03:20:23.682]  And you're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:20:28.911 --> 03:20:32.333]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:32.333 --> 03:20:35.635]  I'm your pinch-hitting host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:35.635 --> 03:20:55.308]  Joining me now is scrappy guerrilla conservative journalist, Laura Loomer, who has extraordinary breaking news about recent irregularities in Washington when it comes to the use of the presidential limousine.
[03:20:55.308 --> 03:20:56.569]  Laura, lay it on us.
[03:20:57.657 --> 03:20:59.218]  Thanks for having me, Roger.
[03:20:59.218 --> 03:21:14.909]  Yeah, so I was teasing this story earlier last week with Alex Jones, but I was able to speak with the source who provided me with the information and their own first-hand encounter, and they've agreed to do an exclusive interview.
[03:21:17.120 --> 03:21:30.331]  In 1999, this source, who will be unnamed for now until they do their interview, was working as a White House advanced staff member in California under Bill Clinton's presidency.
[03:21:30.331 --> 03:21:36.857]  And Bill Clinton would come to Los Angeles, California, and he would stay at the Century Plaza Hotel.
[03:21:36.857 --> 03:21:40.360]  And while he was staying there on numerous occasions, he would
[03:21:42.136 --> 03:21:45.837]  Hang out with Hollywood political donors who are friends of his.
[03:21:45.837 --> 03:21:48.058]  As we know, Bill Clinton is friends with Kevin Spacey.
[03:21:48.058 --> 03:21:49.879]  He's friends with Harvey Weinstein.
[03:21:49.879 --> 03:22:00.002]  And a lot of these other problematic male Hollywood elitists who are now being accused of sexual harassment and rape and sexual assault.
[03:22:00.002 --> 03:22:09.906]  And according to this staffer, he was instructed by another White House staffer under Bill Clinton to entertain Kevin Spacey.
[03:22:10.689 --> 03:22:26.975]  So he used one of the presidential motorcades, and this was, I guess, standard with Bill Clinton's presidency, to entertain Kevin Spacey and took Kevin Spacey out for dinner, to nightclubs with other individuals who were working with Bill Clinton.
[03:22:26.975 --> 03:22:29.576]  Sometimes Bill Clinton was present as well.
[03:22:29.576 --> 03:22:39.780]  And according to the source, he engaged in a sexual act or had sex with Kevin Spacey in one of these official presidential motorcade cars.
[03:22:40.620 --> 03:22:44.861]  And he's not claiming that Spacey assaulted him or harassed him.
[03:22:44.861 --> 03:22:46.142]  It was consensual.
[03:22:46.142 --> 03:22:54.464]  But what he has an issue with and wanted to expose is this blatant abuse of political power and resources on the taxpayer dime, right?
[03:22:54.464 --> 03:23:00.725]  Literally using presidential motorcades, which we pay for as taxpayers, to have sex, right?
[03:23:00.725 --> 03:23:08.207]  To allow your friends who are now being accused of being pedophiles and having to apologize for touching underage boys
[03:23:09.755 --> 03:23:14.918]  For your own sexual perversions and delights.
[03:23:14.918 --> 03:23:15.999]  And it gets worse.
[03:23:15.999 --> 03:23:23.685]  And he went on to say that sometimes the motorcade vehicles used to transport Bill Clinton would smell of alcohol and marijuana.
[03:23:25.618 --> 03:23:31.964]  And another individual who's also implicated in this is Al Gore, who also ran for president.
[03:23:31.964 --> 03:23:38.630]  Al Gore was present at some of these events that Bill Clinton would have at the Century Plaza Hotel when he was in town in California.
[03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:45.476]  And according to the staffer, he was instructed to go on late night Heineken runs for Al Gore.
[03:23:45.476 --> 03:23:52.462]  So he would go out and buy six packs of Heineken for Al Gore, drop them off at his hotel room, and then Al Gore would order
[03:23:53.022 --> 03:23:54.063]  I think we're good.
[03:24:10.430 --> 03:24:17.073]  And it's really interesting that this is all coming to light now because in 2006, Al Gore was actually accused.
[03:24:17.073 --> 03:24:37.243]  An official complaint was filed against him for sexual abuse and it was filed by a masseuse at a hotel who claimed that Al Gore ordered a masseuse to come to his room at a very expensive hotel very late at night and that the session was three hours long and that he sexually abused her.
[03:24:38.894 --> 03:24:55.519]  So to recap this stunning story, your source, and we went through this this morning, you've got this cold, said that the presidential motorcade was being used to pick up and transport prostitutes and other party favors for Bill Clinton.
[03:24:56.079 --> 03:24:56.300]  I don't
[03:25:11.456 --> 03:25:15.358]  An FOB, Friend of Bill.
[03:25:15.358 --> 03:25:16.159]  Extraordinary.
[03:25:16.159 --> 03:25:22.922]  Now, I know you plan to roll this out with your source because we don't put anything on the air.
[03:25:22.922 --> 03:25:28.465]  Infowars.com, we don't have a high degree of confidence, has checked out.
[03:25:28.465 --> 03:25:34.227]  And I know that you are indefatigable in terms of tracking these things down.
[03:25:34.227 --> 03:25:37.009]  By the way, Laura brought my attention to the fact that
[03:25:37.569 --> 03:25:53.325]  Hillary and Chelsea Clinton are in New York City tonight where they have a joint book signing of the books that neither one of them wrote at the Strand Bookstore on West Broadway in downtown Manhattan.
[03:25:53.325 --> 03:25:54.526]  Gee, that's funny.
[03:25:54.526 --> 03:25:57.769]  Loomer and Stone, they're in New York.
[03:25:57.769 --> 03:25:59.311]  Laura, maybe I'll see you over there later.
[03:26:00.444 --> 03:26:03.045]  Yeah, just like we were talking earlier.
[03:26:03.045 --> 03:26:07.387]  I'm looking forward to seeing you later, Roger.
[03:26:07.387 --> 03:26:09.727]  This could be a near riot.
[03:26:09.727 --> 03:26:13.489]  So I find this to be an extraordinary story.
[03:26:13.489 --> 03:26:27.834]  Later on, coming up, we have Kevin Berry, who is the author of the book Vaccine Whistleblower and heads Freedom First, a group arguing that mandatory vaccinations are unconstitutional.
[03:26:28.274 --> 03:26:45.023]  And also, vaccination activist Michelle Ford talking to us about the over $3.7 billion that had been paid out to people damaged by government-required vaccines.
[03:26:45.023 --> 03:26:50.627]  Laura Loomer, thank you so much for joining us on the Alex Jones Show, and I'll see you later.
[03:26:50.627 --> 03:26:52.388]  See you later, Roger.
[03:26:52.388 --> 03:26:53.068]  Thanks for having me.
[03:26:55.416 --> 03:27:03.900]  Folks, now would be a superb time for you to go to the InfoWars.com store where we have some extraordinary specials.
[03:27:03.900 --> 03:27:11.723]  And I feel that I'm remiss if I don't remind you that we here at InfoWars are completely listener and viewer supported.
[03:27:12.538 --> 03:27:23.031]  We don't have any globalist billionaires, any shady red Chinese writing big checks to cover our expansion or our broadcasts.
[03:27:23.031 --> 03:27:30.039]  We have to depend solely on the patriots and info warriors who loyally go to this site.
[03:27:30.842 --> 03:27:34.305]  And some of these sales absolutely blow my mind.
[03:27:34.305 --> 03:27:42.811]  Silver Bullet, the very best colloidal silver product I think in the market, 67% off.
[03:27:42.811 --> 03:27:55.160]  My all-time favorite, which is, of course, Brain Force Plus, making this broadcast entirely possible.
[03:27:55.160 --> 03:27:59.043]  I find that it brings me mental clarity and mental energy.
[03:27:59.043 --> 03:28:00.284]  These are just two examples.
[03:28:00.844 --> 03:28:06.788]  Of the extraordinary sales going on now at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:28:06.788 --> 03:28:10.089]  Brain Force Plus, $19.95.
[03:28:10.089 --> 03:28:11.510]  Extraordinary price.
[03:28:11.510 --> 03:28:13.291]  That's 50% off.
[03:28:13.291 --> 03:28:15.292]  You don't want to be without this.
[03:28:15.292 --> 03:28:20.435]  It makes those 12 and 15 hour days manageable.
[03:28:20.435 --> 03:28:28.520]  So folks, please go to the InfoWars.com store and help us help you help us continue to spear fight the fight for America.
[03:28:41.187 --> 03:28:43.090]  We are on the march.
[03:28:43.090 --> 03:28:46.015]  The empire is on the run.
[03:28:46.015 --> 03:28:48.759]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:53.894 --> 03:28:56.936]  A commemorative President Trump Dollar for only $5?

[03:29:23.536 --> 03:29:24.417]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:29:24.417 --> 03:29:26.798]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:29:26.798 --> 03:29:34.843]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[03:29:34.843 --> 03:29:36.765]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[03:29:36.765 --> 03:29:40.427]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[03:29:40.427 --> 03:29:45.090]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[03:29:45.090 --> 03:29:49.493]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[03:29:49.493 --> 03:29:49.973]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:29:55.433 --> 03:29:58.556]  America is an information-based civil war.
[03:29:58.556 --> 03:30:06.003]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[03:30:06.003 --> 03:30:11.608]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[03:30:12.368 --> 03:30:20.013]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[03:30:20.013 --> 03:30:27.919]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[03:30:28.619 --> 03:30:33.684]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[03:30:33.684 --> 03:30:35.826]  They are the anti-liberals.
[03:30:35.826 --> 03:30:49.217]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:31:55.171 --> 03:31:55.972]  I'm so excited.
[03:31:55.972 --> 03:32:06.138]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:32:06.138 --> 03:32:11.622]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:32:11.622 --> 03:32:14.644]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:32:14.644 --> 03:32:23.430]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:32:25.511 --> 03:32:45.098]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:32:45.098 --> 03:32:47.799]  It is amazing!
[03:32:47.799 --> 03:32:52.761]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:32:56.754 --> 03:32:59.365]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.417 --> 03:33:25.482]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.482 --> 03:33:28.405]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:32.762 --> 03:33:33.743]  Welcome back.
[03:33:33.743 --> 03:33:36.384]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.384 --> 03:33:43.369]  Joining me now is the author of a terrific book called Vaccine Whistleblower.
[03:33:43.369 --> 03:33:48.372]  It is a book recounting the tape-recorded conversations with Dr. William Thompson
[03:33:48.912 --> 03:33:49.893]  Thank you very much, Roger.
[03:33:49.893 --> 03:33:50.673]  Thanks for having me.
[03:34:12.196 --> 03:34:30.950]  So, Kevin, first of all, tell us about your book and what it says, and tell us about the stunning information that you have learned out of California, a state which has now recently made it a requirement that children be vaccinated before they can attend the public schools.
[03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:32.071]  Right.
[03:34:32.071 --> 03:34:35.574]  Dr. Thompson is a CDC vaccine safety researcher.
[03:34:36.500 --> 03:34:43.445]  Four recorded calls were done by Dr. Brian Hooker, who's an activist in California.
[03:34:43.445 --> 03:34:49.510]  And the headline of what Dr. Thompson is saying is that vaccine safety is an open question.
[03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:59.677]  And he's in a position to know because he's a named author on studies of thimerosal, the mercury preservative in vaccines, and on the MMR vaccine.
[03:34:59.677 --> 03:35:05.602]  And he says that research that he was a named author on MMR was fraudulent.
[03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:12.726]  And he says that he would never give his wife the Mirosol-containing shot if she was pregnant.
[03:35:12.726 --> 03:35:23.117]  So, of the entire vaccine schedule, which is allegedly safe, the only two things they ever looked at, they found problems with both.
[03:35:23.117 --> 03:35:25.659]  So, how that applies to California?
[03:35:25.659 --> 03:35:27.581]  Do you want me to go right to California?
[03:35:27.581 --> 03:35:28.162]  Yes, please.
[03:35:30.268 --> 03:35:41.653]  Well, in 2015, California whipped up a frenzy about a few measles cases in Disneyland, none of which were transmitted in schools.
[03:35:41.653 --> 03:35:48.496]  And they passed vaccine mandates covering the 39 million citizens of California.
[03:35:48.496 --> 03:35:51.737]  One-eighth of Americans live in California.
[03:35:51.737 --> 03:35:55.139]  So they got a captive market.
[03:35:55.139 --> 03:35:55.699]  So what
[03:35:56.650 --> 03:36:00.531]  And that bill was dropped in March 2015.
[03:36:00.531 --> 03:36:14.995]  The same week that that bill was dropped, the CALPAC, the California Medical Association's Political Action Committee, donated $100,000, a little over $100,000 to the California Democratic Party.
[03:36:14.995 --> 03:36:19.476]  And then that bill passed through all the California committees, the House, the Senate.
[03:36:20.467 --> 03:36:21.949]  And was signed by the Democratic governor.
[03:36:21.949 --> 03:36:27.335]  All those committees, both houses, were dominated by the Democratic Party.
[03:36:27.335 --> 03:36:30.259]  And that bill passed.
[03:36:30.259 --> 03:36:33.543]  And 39 million Californians are suffering the consequences.
[03:36:35.574 --> 03:36:48.804]  It's extraordinary to me that the federal government has paid out over three and a half billion dollars to Americans who are damaged or injured by mandatory vaccinations.
[03:36:48.804 --> 03:36:55.769]  Yet, Congressman Adam Schiff has sponsored essentially a sense-of-the-house resolution
[03:36:56.651 --> 03:37:07.019]  Uh, which declares that the federal government has never spent a dime, has never paid out a dime in damages done by vaccinations.
[03:37:07.019 --> 03:37:12.883]  This is like sponsoring legislation that says, for example, the Holocaust never happened.
[03:37:13.904 --> 03:37:24.912]  We're going to talk about this with Michelle Ford, who is active with the Vaccination Injury Awareness League, coming up.
[03:37:24.912 --> 03:37:34.160]  But I commend your book, Kevin, to anyone who questions this story of the unsafety of vaccinations.
[03:37:34.801 --> 03:37:44.326]  Tired of being called a conspiracy theorist and a crook when the science and the numbers show the enormous damage.
[03:37:44.326 --> 03:37:48.869]  I, by the way, believe that there's probably nothing wrong with vaccinations.
[03:37:48.869 --> 03:37:53.531]  It's what's in the vaccinations that seems to be causing problems.
[03:37:53.531 --> 03:38:01.196]  And evidently changing that would cost Big Pharma millions and millions of dollars.
[03:38:01.196 --> 03:38:03.597]  I'm extraordinarily disappointed.
[03:38:04.831 --> 03:38:06.592]  In this narrow sense.
[03:38:06.592 --> 03:38:09.274]  Look, I love the record stock market.
[03:38:09.274 --> 03:38:12.156]  I love unemployment at an all-time low.
[03:38:12.156 --> 03:38:15.199]  I love the record housing market.
[03:38:15.199 --> 03:38:23.606]  I like the fact that the president seems determined to renegotiate some of these bum trade agreements that are destroying our job market.
[03:38:23.606 --> 03:38:25.267]  But where I am very disappointed
[03:38:26.104 --> 03:38:50.016]  Was in the president's announcement when he was the president-elect that he would appoint a commission to investigate vaccination safety and that he would ask the activist and environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the senator of the late New York senator, the son of the late New York senator, to head such a commission.
[03:38:50.686 --> 03:38:57.581]  Kennedy is known as a man of integrity who's extremely well-versed on this issue.
[03:38:57.581 --> 03:38:59.024]  Yet, since that time...
[03:38:59.735 --> 03:39:09.118]  The President has declared an opioid crisis, and he's appointed a commission to pursue that, which is a vital public health issue.
[03:39:09.118 --> 03:39:17.701]  But so far, we have no commission, and I am told that Mr. Kennedy hears nothing from the White House.
[03:39:17.701 --> 03:39:27.405]  This is disappointing, because the President is known to have his own personal concerns about the safety of vaccinations.
[03:39:27.825 --> 03:39:32.830]  He expressed them numerous times in the campaign.
[03:39:32.830 --> 03:39:42.781]  Does the president know that his FDA appointee to head the FDA is a mandatory vaccination advocate?
[03:39:43.972 --> 03:40:02.966]  It really is extraordinary that we're allowing the massive wealth transfer of billions of dollars in injuries to chronic lifetime medical issues while removing millions of future adults from ever working because of this mandatory vaccination policy.
[03:40:03.426 --> 03:40:08.629]  Vaccination safety requires rigorous science backed by true quality control.
[03:40:08.629 --> 03:40:10.830]  We don't have that today.
[03:40:10.830 --> 03:40:13.792]  None of it exists in the FDA.
[03:40:13.792 --> 03:40:21.836]  Something that the President should understand as a builder and someone who is exacting in his standards.
[03:40:21.836 --> 03:40:25.838]  So I ask again, I call on the President
[03:40:26.454 --> 03:40:29.495]  Please follow through on your pledge.
[03:40:29.495 --> 03:40:32.316]  Let's see where the science is.
[03:40:32.316 --> 03:40:37.297]  You can appoint advocates of vaccinations to the commission if you wish.
[03:40:37.297 --> 03:40:43.739]  Mr. Kennedy would be an able choice to chair this panel and get to the bottom of this question.
[03:40:44.609 --> 03:40:55.154]  As for this Christmas, I urge you to pick up a copy of Kevin Berry's terrific book, Vaccination Whistleblower.
[03:40:55.154 --> 03:41:02.478]  This was the first book that I read on the topic, and it very, very clearly opened my eyes.
[03:41:02.478 --> 03:41:05.779]  Kevin Berry, thanks for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:41:08.860 --> 03:41:15.705]  This is an issue that I think most of you know the mainstream media has a virtual blockade on.
[03:41:15.705 --> 03:41:26.432]  You're not going to find CNN or Fox or ABC or NBC or CBS talking about the issue of vaccination safety.
[03:41:26.432 --> 03:41:33.016]  Yet we plow straight ahead here at InfoWars, going where the science and the facts take us.
[03:41:33.676 --> 03:41:48.400]  And if you like our style, if you like the way we are busting the chops of the political establishment, take a moment to go to the InfoWars.com store now and look at the terrific, deep-discounted products there.

[03:42:01.904 --> 03:42:07.046]  Bill Clinton using the presidential limousine to trawl for hookers.
[03:42:07.046 --> 03:42:11.667]  You won't find the stunning truth in the mainstream media.
[03:42:11.667 --> 03:42:19.269]  You'll only find it in a handful of alt-right and conservative independent media organizations.
[03:42:19.269 --> 03:42:26.051]  And the very best of those, the cutting edge, the tip of the spear, is right here at InfoWars.

[03:44:57.622 --> 03:45:02.305]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:45:02.305 --> 03:45:03.806]  Optimum levels.
[03:45:04.861 --> 03:45:09.523]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[03:45:09.523 --> 03:45:11.844]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[03:45:11.844 --> 03:45:13.625]  B vitamins we need every day.
[03:45:13.625 --> 03:45:18.907]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[03:45:18.907 --> 03:45:21.208]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[03:45:21.208 --> 03:45:26.850]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:45:26.850 --> 03:45:27.251]  Secret 12.
[03:45:27.251 --> 03:45:28.031]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[03:45:28.311 --> 03:45:28.811]  We're good.
[03:45:53.922 --> 03:45:55.883]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[03:45:55.883 --> 03:45:57.183]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:45:57.183 --> 03:45:58.404]  Why is this so good?
[03:45:58.404 --> 03:46:03.686]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:46:03.686 --> 03:46:17.231]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:46:17.231 --> 03:46:18.572]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:46:19.352 --> 03:46:21.013]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:46:21.013 --> 03:46:23.594]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:46:23.594 --> 03:46:24.895]  These are all parasites.
[03:46:24.895 --> 03:46:25.996]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:46:25.996 --> 03:46:27.336]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:46:27.336 --> 03:46:31.839]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:46:31.839 --> 03:46:35.100]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:46:35.100 --> 03:46:38.182]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:46:38.182 --> 03:46:39.223]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:46:39.223 --> 03:46:40.043]  Living Defense.
[03:46:40.043 --> 03:46:41.144]  Infowarslife.com.

[03:46:44.886 --> 03:46:45.126]  And, uh,
[03:46:45.746 --> 03:46:47.087]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:09.907 --> 03:47:14.275]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:47:14.275 --> 03:47:18.803]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:18.803 --> 03:47:22.069]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:25.481 --> 03:47:28.504]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.504 --> 03:47:31.087]  I'm your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:31.087 --> 03:47:46.825]  Joining us now is Michelle Ford of the Vaccination Injury Awareness League, an activist and one of the most informed people I know on the issue of vaccination safety.
[03:47:47.526 --> 03:48:07.564]  It was Michelle Ford who brought my attention to the idea that Congressman Adam Schiff has sponsored essentially a resolution declaring that the federal government has never paid out even a farthing, even a penny for injury of citizens by vaccinations.
[03:48:07.564 --> 03:48:11.787]  Michelle, would you now correct the record for us?
[03:48:11.787 --> 03:48:12.928]  Thank you so much, Roger.
[03:48:12.928 --> 03:48:14.590]  Yes, I'd love to correct the record.
[03:48:15.978 --> 03:48:34.315]  Because, you know, essentially Adam Schiff is saying that there's no credible evidence whatsoever of vaccine injury, yet the Federal Court of Claims has paid out over $3.7 billion since the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was passed in 1986.
[03:48:37.161 --> 03:48:48.424]  It's ridiculous to try to make a claim that vaccine injuries don't exist when the government is regularly paying out vaccine injuries.
[03:48:48.424 --> 03:48:49.045]  It's horrible.
[03:48:49.045 --> 03:48:52.165]  And where does that information exist?
[03:48:52.165 --> 03:48:56.087]  How do we document that that has happened?
[03:48:56.087 --> 03:48:56.607]  Oh my goodness.
[03:48:56.607 --> 03:49:00.948]  Well, my favorite place to find it is the Mom Street Journal.
[03:49:02.373 --> 03:49:21.869]  Lori Gregory is a blogger and a mom and she has done incredible research on the Federal Court of Claims and actually one year ago today, November 29, 2016, she reported on a flu vaccine injury payout increase of almost 400%.
[03:49:23.610 --> 03:49:40.087]  And then shortly thereafter when the 2016 report came out, she issued another blog post indicating that the flu vaccine injury had increased by an additional 1188% over prior year.
[03:49:40.087 --> 03:49:46.554]  So I love to go to the momstreetjournal.com because she's got all of the embedded links and you can
[03:49:47.364 --> 03:49:54.632]  Quickly and easily locate the Federal Court of Claims report that will bring you right to the Federal Court of Claims.
[03:49:54.632 --> 03:50:00.599]  Because if you try to Google it, you're going to be on a little bit of a rabbit hole witch hunt looking for that thing.
[03:50:00.599 --> 03:50:02.982]  But it's right there embedded on her articles.
[03:50:03.854 --> 03:50:07.555]  Well, I'm very familiar with the terrific work of Lori Gregory.
[03:50:07.555 --> 03:50:14.036]  We're going to get her on here at InfoWars to continue our dialogue on this important issue.
[03:50:14.036 --> 03:50:24.919]  As I recall, there's actually a website, doesn't have much of a search engine, that is posted by the government that details these incredible payouts.
[03:50:25.866 --> 03:50:31.409]  So it's hard to fathom how a member of Congress can deny reality.
[03:50:31.409 --> 03:50:36.491]  It's like saying the sky isn't blue or rain isn't wet.
[03:50:36.491 --> 03:50:39.652]  It is an undisputed fact.
[03:50:39.652 --> 03:50:51.017]  I don't know if Mr. Schiff is seeking contributions from Big Pharma or why he would promulgate a lie, an extraordinary lie.
[03:50:51.017 --> 03:50:53.938]  You brought my attention to the website.
[03:50:53.938 --> 03:50:55.019]  Tell us a little bit about that.
[03:50:57.179 --> 03:50:58.740]  Which website are you talking about?
[03:50:58.740 --> 03:51:01.162]  The Federal Court of Claims website?
[03:51:01.162 --> 03:51:03.123]  Yes.
[03:51:03.123 --> 03:51:08.987]  Let me give you the exact name from some of your extraordinary research.
[03:51:08.987 --> 03:51:15.171]  But this is a, the national, let's see, here it is.
[03:51:15.171 --> 03:51:21.216]  The HMOs under the CDC collected this information.
[03:51:21.216 --> 03:51:23.217]  Kaiser and others.
[03:51:23.217 --> 03:51:24.718]  So address that if you would.
[03:51:25.740 --> 03:51:30.148]  Okay, so there's something called the Vaccine Safety Data Link.
[03:51:30.148 --> 03:51:33.153]  And it was in partnership with the CDC.
[03:51:33.153 --> 03:51:39.283]  It was formed in the early 1990s after the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act went into effect.
[03:51:39.952 --> 03:51:48.635]  And essentially, Roger, it's a warehouse, a warehouse of data that independent researchers do not have easy access to.
[03:51:48.635 --> 03:52:02.141]  In fact, I only know of two independent science researchers who had access to it and they were not allowed to photograph the details, take photocopies, remove any of the data from their visit.
[03:52:02.141 --> 03:52:05.082]  Essentially, they were only able to take notes.
[03:52:06.098 --> 03:52:06.619]  I think so.
[03:52:24.864 --> 03:52:28.787]  Scrutinize the data that's in there and have a look at what's really going on.
[03:52:28.787 --> 03:52:31.710]  But the data is being kept private from the public.
[03:52:31.710 --> 03:52:42.038]  I believe there's about a $10 million annual budget to keep it locked up through the America's Health Insurance Plans, the AHIP.
[03:52:42.038 --> 03:52:49.163]  And because it's a private entity, the AHIP, that information cannot be requested through the Freedom of Information Act.
[03:52:50.131 --> 03:52:59.137]  So we've got Kaiser Permanente of Washington, the Northwest, Northern California, Southern California, Colorado.
[03:52:59.137 --> 03:53:13.787]  We also have health partners in Minnesota, Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin, Harvard Pilgrim in Maine, and all of these HMOs partner with the CDC to keep the information away from the public.
[03:53:13.787 --> 03:53:17.049]  So it's horrible that we don't have access to that data.
[03:53:18.993 --> 03:53:25.415]  Yeah, you've got almost two decades of information that the American people should be entitled to.
[03:53:25.415 --> 03:53:29.417]  And it documents the very payouts that we're talking about.
[03:53:29.417 --> 03:53:34.879]  The payouts that Adam Schiff insists never really happened.
[03:53:35.860 --> 03:53:49.011]  What is your view now of the President's seeming inaction on his pledge to appoint a commission to study vaccination safety?
[03:53:49.011 --> 03:54:00.260]  I know that you, like me, were very pleased by the President's indication that Robert Kennedy Jr., the son of the former New York U.S.
[03:54:00.260 --> 03:54:03.463]  Senator, would head such a commission.
[03:54:03.963 --> 03:54:08.826]  I think that, you know, Trump is a businessman and Trump needs to be able to have access to this, these numbers.
[03:54:25.757 --> 03:54:30.281]  Is he aware that there's been $3.7 billion paid out in vaccine injury?
[03:54:30.281 --> 03:54:36.986]  Is he aware that there's about $10 million a year keeping information away from the American public?
[03:54:36.986 --> 03:54:42.650]  Is someone in Congress keeping track of the increased number of children with disabilities?
[03:54:42.650 --> 03:54:50.216]  Is anyone keeping track of the exorbitant expenses involved with raising a child with autism?
[03:54:50.216 --> 03:54:53.179]  You know, we're essentially trading short-term
[03:54:54.130 --> 03:55:00.393]  illness, a short-term disease, for chronic, lifelong illness.
[03:55:00.393 --> 03:55:02.655]  And it's crippling our country.
[03:55:02.655 --> 03:55:06.617]  It will, in the long term, cripple our economy.
[03:55:06.617 --> 03:55:22.365]  And Dr. Stephanie Seneff of MIT, she's an incredibly gifted mathematician and she's got so many letters after her name I don't even know all of them, but she did the math and essentially figured out that by the year 2032,
[03:55:25.368 --> 03:55:30.273]  50% of all children are going to be diagnosed with autism and 80% of boys.
[03:55:30.273 --> 03:55:32.815]  So what's that going to do to our country as an economy?
[03:55:32.815 --> 03:55:36.619]  How are we going to be a viable force in this world?
[03:55:36.619 --> 03:55:45.028]  So I think that if someone can speak to Trump about the numbers, that may be the thing that's going to have him wake up to this reality.
[03:55:45.028 --> 03:55:48.071]  The other thing too, Roger, if you don't mind that I take a moment.
[03:55:48.960 --> 03:56:05.306]  I really urge the president to overturn executive order number 13139, which was the executive order under Bill Clinton, which mandated anthrax vaccines for all of our active duty military.
[03:56:05.306 --> 03:56:07.186]  It is a forced situation.
[03:56:07.186 --> 03:56:10.607]  These active duty military have no choice in the matter.
[03:56:10.607 --> 03:56:12.348]  There have been court marshals.
[03:56:13.280 --> 03:56:15.542]  And this is horrible.
[03:56:15.542 --> 03:56:18.964]  We're seeing lots and lots of disability.
[03:56:18.964 --> 03:56:37.637]  There's an incredible film called Vaccine Syndrome by a filmmaker named Scott Miller who has spent the last 15 years detailing what's happening to our active duty military's health and frankly the health of their offspring by having had to be forced to take the anthrax vaccine.
[03:56:38.829 --> 03:56:44.190]  It's not just a problem for children, it's also a problem for adults.
[03:56:44.190 --> 03:56:59.374]  We saw, you know, earlier this week, 50 nurses in Minnesota were excused from their job by Essentia Health, again in Minnesota, for refusing to take the flu vaccine.
[03:56:59.374 --> 03:57:06.195]  And some of these people, some of these nurses, didn't want to take the vaccine because they had suffered a vaccine reaction.
[03:57:06.195 --> 03:57:08.276]  So vaccine reactions are very real.
[03:57:09.389 --> 03:57:14.634]  Pretending that they don't exist would be like pretending that other drugs don't have reactions.
[03:57:14.634 --> 03:57:16.315]  And we know that that's simply not the truth.
[03:57:16.315 --> 03:57:20.319]  They do cause reactions.
[03:57:20.319 --> 03:57:20.800]  All right.
[03:57:20.800 --> 03:57:25.384]  Thank you, Michele Ford, for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:25.384 --> 03:57:27.966]  Please stay on top of the news.
[03:57:27.966 --> 03:57:28.807]  It's out.
[03:57:28.807 --> 03:57:29.688]  Laurie Gregory.
[03:57:29.688 --> 03:57:30.249]  Many thanks.
[03:57:36.645 --> 03:57:38.526]  We are on the march.
[03:57:38.526 --> 03:57:41.467]  The empire is on the run.
[03:57:41.467 --> 03:57:43.667]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:43.667 --> 03:57:51.910]  President Trump once again called Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas and now the establishment media says that Trump insulted her Native American heritage.
[03:57:52.170 --> 03:57:57.434]  When he used the racial slur, fact check, Elizabeth Warren is not Native American.
[03:57:57.434 --> 03:58:07.002]  There is zero evidence that Warren is Cherokee, yet she's claimed for years that it's part of her family folklore and that her pawpaw had high cheekbones.
[03:58:07.002 --> 03:58:11.645]  Warren didn't self-identify as Native American until she was 38 years old.
[03:58:11.645 --> 03:58:15.909]  She claimed that minority status for years in order to climb the academic ladder.
[03:58:16.249 --> 03:58:26.253]  And this false information wasn't something she just claimed as a student, but Warren began putting it in her professional bios for years when law schools were hungry for minority faculty.
[03:58:26.253 --> 03:58:32.595]  Foca-Hontas lied about being Native American in order to gain an unfair advantage in securing academic tenure.
[03:58:32.595 --> 03:58:39.698]  This means she actually stole that position from a real Native American who could have benefited from their minority status.
[03:58:39.698 --> 03:58:41.058]  Racist!
