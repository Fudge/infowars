[00:00.000 --> 00:10.280]  There's a need for a new world order, but it has different characteristics in different
[00:10.280 --> 00:14.280]  parts of the world.
[00:14.280 --> 00:39.280]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:39.280 --> 00:51.120]  Wow, where to start today?
[00:51.120 --> 00:54.200]  We know what's going on behind the scenes with Matt Lauer being removed.
[00:54.200 --> 00:56.840]  I've been talking about this for six months.
[00:56.840 --> 01:03.440]  I told you that when Charlie Rose was removed, get ready to see most of the other big anchors
[01:03.440 --> 01:10.760]  removed who have big, giant contracts, and they're not delivering globalism, they're
[01:10.760 --> 01:13.520]  not delivering ratings, they're not delivering the new world order.
[01:13.520 --> 01:18.120]  That's why the mainstream media has been fighting so hard since President Trump was elected
[01:18.120 --> 01:23.820]  a year ago to try to defeat him and defeat the American recovery.
[01:23.820 --> 01:33.360]  Because if ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, if they can't deliver at the New York Times, the Washington
[01:33.360 --> 01:39.840]  Post, owned all the multinational globalist kingpins, the Carlos Slims, the slave factory
[01:39.840 --> 01:46.640]  Jeff Bezos, if they can't deliver, then they're worthless, and they're going to have their
[01:46.640 --> 01:47.640]  contracts terminated.
[01:47.640 --> 01:53.480]  But you've got to have a clause to get out of these five, 10, $15 million-a-year contracts.
[01:53.480 --> 01:54.840]  And how do you do it?
[01:54.840 --> 01:58.840]  They know all about the sexual harassment.
[01:58.840 --> 01:59.920]  They know all about it.
[01:59.920 --> 02:00.920]  It's been proven.
[02:00.920 --> 02:04.160]  They know all about it with conures, they know all about it with all these different
[02:04.160 --> 02:06.440]  talk show hosts.
[02:06.440 --> 02:10.480]  But now, because people are going public in this time of awakening, they're going to
[02:10.480 --> 02:17.240]  make lemonade out of lemons, and they're going to use it to purge all the deadwood.
[02:17.240 --> 02:20.560]  Now it looks like, well, it doesn't look like the New York police are reporting, the LA
[02:20.560 --> 02:27.640]  police are reporting, sex trafficking, sex trafficking of reported women that were in
[02:27.640 --> 02:30.440]  sex slavery.
[02:30.440 --> 02:36.720]  That's the next big shoot-a-drop for Mr. Weinstein and all his lawyers and all the
[02:36.720 --> 02:40.840]  private detectives and all the Mossad operatives.
[02:40.840 --> 02:48.520]  Well, that's been mainstream news, running around, engaging in all sorts of operations
[02:48.520 --> 02:54.320]  in this country, using sex to control people, and I want to be clear, you've got a leftist
[02:54.320 --> 02:58.440]  arm in Israel, a right-wing arm, and you've got Hasidic groups, you've got a lot of different
[02:58.440 --> 02:59.440]  people.
[02:59.440 --> 03:04.320]  The same leftist groups trying to overthrow Trump are the same ones involved with Weinstein
[03:04.320 --> 03:05.320]  out of Israel.
[03:05.320 --> 03:11.080]  So, again, it's a leftist issue, whether you're in Russia or whether you're in the UK or whether
[03:11.080 --> 03:15.720]  you're in Israel, it's leftist groups that are really at the vanguard of using these
[03:15.720 --> 03:17.040]  tactics.
[03:17.040 --> 03:22.600]  There are more Soros foundations in groups in Russia than there are in the U.S. I mean,
[03:22.600 --> 03:29.120]  Russia is barely under its own control right now, just barely pulling the face sucker off.
[03:29.120 --> 03:34.160]  So, when I talk about the Mossad being involved in this, that's been in mainstream news, it's
[03:34.160 --> 03:39.720]  not an attack on Israel, because the media will spin it as that, that's all they do.
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.080]  It's just showing you these are intelligence agencies, these are factions of intelligence
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.560]  agencies, and it's Trump with patriots in our intelligence agencies that are rolling
[03:48.560 --> 03:49.560]  this up.
[03:49.560 --> 03:51.280]  I don't just think that.
[03:51.280 --> 03:57.680]  I have sources in all the major intelligence groups and in the SEAL teams and in the Army
[03:57.680 --> 04:02.840]  special operations and in all those major groups, okay, and there is a civil war in
[04:02.840 --> 04:03.840]  this country.
[04:03.840 --> 04:05.320]  We have the secret service contacts.
[04:05.320 --> 04:10.200]  We have the contacts in Google, Facebook, Amazon, mid-level, low-level, high-level.
[04:10.200 --> 04:14.120]  I've got so much intel, and it's all incredibly accurate.
[04:14.120 --> 04:18.040]  I mean, when I say it's all incredibly accurate, people are risking their lives with this stuff.
[04:18.040 --> 04:21.160]  So, the media tries to spin it all.
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.840]  There were scores of headlines in Newsweek and Time yesterday.
[04:25.840 --> 04:30.640]  Alex Jones calls Vegas Massacre phony and says it doesn't exist.
[04:30.640 --> 04:34.080]  Never said that total lie, but that's how they counter it.
[04:34.080 --> 04:40.040]  When we get a source breaking down the Islamic civil war going on spilling over into Vegas,
[04:40.040 --> 04:42.360]  they want that shut down so they put out this info.
[04:42.360 --> 04:45.880]  We're going to cover North Korea, what's behind the Matt Lauer thing, what's happening
[04:45.880 --> 04:50.160]  with Conyers, the EU president admitting their real plan for world government using
[04:50.160 --> 05:01.040]  migrant invasions, it is all coming up today, so strap yourselves in and spread the word.
[05:01.040 --> 05:02.040]  I'm so excited.
[05:02.040 --> 05:07.480]  The new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to
[05:07.480 --> 05:12.160]  the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[05:12.160 --> 05:17.640]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[05:17.640 --> 05:20.520]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[05:20.520 --> 05:26.560]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[05:26.560 --> 05:33.040]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae
[05:33.040 --> 05:38.240]  and I came up with our own formulae working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[05:38.240 --> 05:44.840]  right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to it,
[05:44.840 --> 05:49.320]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[05:49.320 --> 05:53.800]  hormones in your glands, it is amazing.
[05:53.800 --> 06:17.840]  Red pill, now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase of the operation.
[06:23.800 --> 06:36.040]  Our republic is in the middle of a civil war.
[06:36.040 --> 06:41.160]  The globalist faction is foreign multinational cutthroat banks, allied with the communists,
[06:41.160 --> 06:45.560]  China, the EU, the Vatican, and other criminal organizations, the Vatican has been seized
[06:45.560 --> 06:50.520]  by the globalist, even mainline Catholics will tell you that, and they use pedophile
[06:50.520 --> 06:54.240]  rings to penetrate it, compromise it, and get control of it, the same things happen
[06:54.240 --> 06:59.920]  to the US to a certain extent, and right now, Trump and patriots in our intelligence agencies
[06:59.920 --> 07:05.560]  are beginning to remove the tentacles and remove the face sucker from our face, but
[07:05.560 --> 07:10.300]  it's got tentacles still wrapped around our arm, trying to get back on our neck, trying
[07:10.300 --> 07:16.840]  to get back on our face, but every day that we pull hard and focus and pray, but are politically
[07:16.840 --> 07:22.280]  active, the face sucker gets further and further away, and its tentacles get looser and looser,
[07:22.280 --> 07:31.440]  and it is now desperately in its final, last gasp gambit, trying to get back on our face
[07:31.440 --> 07:35.480]  and suffocate us, that's the best way to describe them, look at these headlines on
[07:35.480 --> 07:46.640]  Drudge, great, not just America, but great, GDP revised up 3.3, they made fun of Trump,
[07:46.640 --> 07:52.320]  they made fun of everybody, they said it'll never hit 3%, because Obama could never hit
[07:52.320 --> 08:02.120]  3%, think about that, think about that, could never do it, 3.3, if he gets these moderate
[08:02.120 --> 08:08.160]  tax cuts through, they're talking 7 to 10% growth rate, just like China's got, meanwhile
[08:08.160 --> 08:14.600]  John McCain again, stands in the way of the Obamacare appeal, and of the tax cuts, he's
[08:14.600 --> 08:21.160]  the one vote that we don't have, and it looks like it's all down to him again, and some
[08:21.160 --> 08:25.160]  people have pointed out that he's in photos wearing the boot on the left leg and the right
[08:25.160 --> 08:32.200]  leg, and that it's all fake, and that the brain tumor's fake to give him sympathy, no,
[08:32.200 --> 08:37.560]  you can see he's a dying man, you can look at him neurologically, he has trouble speaking
[08:37.560 --> 08:41.840]  now, that is not an act, he's probably so bombed out of his brain, he just puts the
[08:41.840 --> 08:46.200]  boot on the wrong foot some days, because it is true, he's wearing the boot in different
[08:46.200 --> 08:51.680]  videos and photos the last month on different feet every other day, so he is in cloud cuckoo
[08:51.680 --> 08:56.720]  land, and so I feel really sorry for him, I don't wish horrible things really on anybody,
[08:56.720 --> 09:00.600]  even though he's a globalist and done a lot of bad things, it just doesn't seem like good
[09:00.600 --> 09:10.480]  luck to revel in that, but if you go to infowars.com and newswars.com, there is just so much really
[09:10.480 --> 09:16.960]  important news that we're going to be getting to today that I'm going to be breaking down,
[09:16.960 --> 09:22.360]  we have what's really behind Matt Lauer's firing, I'm going to get into that, and Weinstein
[09:22.360 --> 09:28.080]  facing sex trafficking, kidnapping charges, we're also going to get into a bunch of disinfo
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.640]  in the news claiming that I have said no one was shot at Vegas, that is a total and complete
[09:33.640 --> 09:38.240]  lie, but that's what mainstream fake news does, they misrepresent everything to try
[09:38.240 --> 09:49.280]  to manipulate people, because we're dead on with intel about exactly what did happen there,
[09:49.280 --> 09:53.960]  and the whistleblower we had on was picked up by the FBI for reporting it, but still
[09:53.960 --> 09:58.560]  doesn't want his name known to the public, and again it's a totally real source, so
[09:58.560 --> 10:04.080]  real the FBI was there in two hours, so real he's now left the country, and when it all
[10:04.080 --> 10:09.600]  comes out and his name is known he's been in a couple hundred newspapers before and
[10:09.600 --> 10:17.040]  very respected in the Army Special Operations Intelligence community, so it's a big deal,
[10:17.040 --> 10:21.400]  and he said on air who was involved and what was going on, you can look it up, the Saudis
[10:21.400 --> 10:26.800]  were there, they were having military convention there, and the report is it was a spell over
[10:26.800 --> 10:32.200]  in the Saudi civil war that's ongoing right now with thousands arrested, hundreds dead,
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.960]  helicopters blowing up, mass shootouts, most of it gets covered up in the news, but that's
[10:36.960 --> 10:45.400]  what happened, as best intel we have, and that's what my FBI sources have said absolutely
[10:45.400 --> 10:51.160]  Alex we can't give you any more information but you're on the trail, so what do they do
[10:51.160 --> 10:55.880]  when something like that comes out, they just change the subject and edit quotes I've made
[10:55.880 --> 11:03.120]  where it makes no sense talking to a caller and just sounds crazy, but if you want to
[11:03.120 --> 11:06.960]  actually hear the interview that had the FBI actually you know go detain the individual
[11:06.960 --> 11:11.000]  for two days, well we'll put it back on screen so I can give it to radio listeners, here
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.840]  is the headline where you can find the interview, breaking intel Saudi Arabia, connection to
[11:17.840 --> 11:24.280]  Vegas, more attacks could be coming, and of course this is all before the civil war openly
[11:24.280 --> 11:28.920]  kicked off in Saudi Arabia that the guest told everybody about and what was about to
[11:28.920 --> 11:34.400]  happen and who was about to be rounded up, because this individual is from an American
[11:34.400 --> 11:39.840]  father and a Muslim mother and has been raised in the Middle East and so has been involved
[11:39.840 --> 11:47.560]  in all those major obvious black ops where you need people that speak Arabic and Farsi
[11:47.560 --> 11:53.360]  and all the rest of that, so that's why they're so upset about this source and the information
[11:53.360 --> 11:58.360]  that they don't want you to know and the media spun it like I was blaming Trump, I wasn't
[11:58.360 --> 12:03.680]  blaming Trump, I said it's part of the civil war going on now that Trump has gone in and
[12:03.680 --> 12:09.040]  actually made a deal to not have ISIS in al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia anymore and to have Saudi
[12:09.040 --> 12:12.200]  Arabia announce that they're actually not going to play a double game but they're going
[12:12.200 --> 12:17.240]  to declare total war on it and shut it down, you heard that months ago from Zach, that's
[12:17.240 --> 12:24.480]  his real first name, people can do some ferreting and figure out who he is and that fit into
[12:24.480 --> 12:30.080]  all my other sources, I didn't just believe Zach and so now two days ago Saudi Arabia
[12:30.080 --> 12:36.000]  and 42 other nations declare total war on Wahhabist Islam which has been coming out
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.600]  of their country, instead of exporting it over here they're saying we're done, Trump
[12:41.600 --> 12:48.400]  applauds the feet of ISIS, promises to promote lasting peace in Syria and justice for terrorists
[12:48.400 --> 12:53.440]  and they've actually cut off ISIS, smashed it and have basically destroyed it by cutting
[12:53.440 --> 12:59.560]  off its supporters in Saudi Arabia, they've been arrested, they've been killed, they've
[12:59.560 --> 13:04.880]  been blown up, they've been hung by their feet until they told them where the terrorist
[13:04.880 --> 13:08.720]  cells were and I'm not defending that but you better believe people got tortured big
[13:08.720 --> 13:16.640]  time inside the rich Carlton there in Saudi Arabia, so that's what's going on here ladies
[13:16.640 --> 13:20.840]  and gentlemen, you want ISIS and Al Qaeda smashed, you don't want double deal globalists
[13:20.840 --> 13:26.840]  in the CIA working with them, Trump came in and said it's over, kill them all, the day
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.400]  he got elected he went over to the CIA and they closed the doors with all the head people
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.120]  and he said we're not playing these games anymore, you're either with me or against
[13:35.120 --> 13:39.760]  me, we're going to kill the entire leadership of ISIS and Al Qaeda and I catch anybody
[13:39.760 --> 13:46.480]  double dealing, you're going to prison or worse, you understand?
[13:46.480 --> 13:51.120]  And I've talked to two people that were there and let me tell you, he handed out little
[13:51.120 --> 13:57.840]  wooden American flag plaques to everybody, that's so the CIA can know, there you go,
[13:57.840 --> 14:02.520]  so that's why they all completely freaked out and the networks in Saudi Arabia freaked
[14:02.520 --> 14:06.880]  out because they were running this and they've been striking back at the U.S. and funding
[14:06.880 --> 14:12.360]  anti-fun, funding Lynda Sorcerer and funding all these groups through Soros and it's all
[14:12.360 --> 14:17.560]  coming to an end, your networks are smashed, you've been cut off, you've been destroyed
[14:17.560 --> 14:23.320]  and now they've got headless cells still in the West that you've seen activating and bombing
[14:23.320 --> 14:28.000]  and attacking because their last order was if you don't get more orders from us start
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.920]  bombing, start killing, so you've got headless chickens running around spewing blood out,
[14:33.920 --> 14:38.160]  they don't have law and they're getting rounded up right now, you want to smash radical Islam
[14:38.160 --> 14:44.240]  baby, it's happening, not double dealing, not double games, not Machiavellian crap, but
[14:44.240 --> 14:50.960]  decapitation, bye bye, done, over.
[14:50.960 --> 14:55.280]  That's what Trump's doing, delivering on the economy, delivering on the border, delivering
[14:55.280 --> 15:00.080]  on medical care to the veterans, delivering on bringing jobs back, delivering on breaking
[15:00.080 --> 15:05.720]  the back of political correctness that is so whacked out it's telling us we can't even
[15:05.720 --> 15:11.200]  say Merry Christmas or Mother or Father or White Christmas is banned and man let me tell
[15:11.200 --> 15:15.600]  you something, I love everybody, every color, every unit but I get in these Uber cabs and
[15:15.600 --> 15:20.440]  last night one of my security people flew back in from seeing family, there was a guy
[15:20.440 --> 15:26.000]  from Nigeria in the car, playing the most anti, kill, whitey, take him out, all this
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.520]  stuff while he's in the Uber with a white guy in the back and I've just got stacks of
[15:30.520 --> 15:35.400]  news where the left is trying to invoke a race war in this country and it's just everywhere,
[15:35.400 --> 15:41.960]  I can't even get away from it, this is all artificial, it's a joke, two years ago African
[15:41.960 --> 15:48.720]  people migrating to the US weren't like this, they've been filled with hatred but now America
[15:48.720 --> 15:53.400]  and the world is waking up, what really happened to Matt Lauer and the next shoe to drop, the
[15:53.400 --> 15:59.520]  North Korea situation, the economy roaring back, more intel on Hillary, straight ahead.

[20:02.000 --> 20:19.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:19.000 --> 20:31.880]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[20:31.880 --> 20:36.760]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:36.760 --> 20:40.960]  Look at this Paul Joseph Watson article with video coming up in the next segment.
[20:40.960 --> 20:46.800]  Katie Couric flashback Matt Lauer pinches me on the rear end a lot.
[20:46.800 --> 20:52.520]  He said the other word NBC host predatory behavior seems to have been widespread.
[20:52.520 --> 20:58.360]  Yeah, they had joke skits about it all over television.
[20:58.360 --> 21:07.240]  Just like they had the cartoons where babies have escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement.
[21:07.240 --> 21:12.680]  So it's just overwhelming the amount of news we have right now that is just exposing these
[21:12.680 --> 21:25.160]  people but during the break I saw documented evidence that is so over the top from wiki
[21:25.160 --> 21:32.520]  leaks and certain individuals that have been attacking President Trump and then we did more
[21:32.520 --> 21:35.360]  research and it got a lot worse from that point.
[21:35.360 --> 21:40.400]  It got a lot worse from that point.
[21:40.400 --> 21:46.760]  I mean this is so crazy what I saw during the break from my researchers that I can hardly
[21:46.760 --> 21:51.160]  even continue doing the show right now because we already know who they are.
[21:51.160 --> 21:52.640]  We already know what they're up to.
[21:52.640 --> 21:59.800]  We already know it makes them tick but just it just keeps getting confirmed in triplicate
[21:59.800 --> 22:03.720]  and I'm not at liberty to talk about some things at this point that soon I'll be able
[22:03.720 --> 22:06.000]  to but let me just tell you something.
[22:06.000 --> 22:11.080]  This is beyond a James Bond movie right now and all eyes are on us and I don't say that
[22:11.080 --> 22:12.440]  even in a positive way.
[22:12.440 --> 22:21.560]  I wish that all eyes were on other people that knew this information because I'm not
[22:21.560 --> 22:24.600]  trying to ask for it.
[22:24.600 --> 22:29.320]  I mean I don't want to die but I also don't want to be a slave and I don't want my children
[22:29.320 --> 22:35.720]  to be slaves but nobody's got to pay grade for this.
[22:35.720 --> 22:37.440]  I can't keep track of it all.
[22:37.440 --> 22:46.600]  It's mountainous, it's insane, it's crazy and it's like do I want to expose sex orgies
[22:46.600 --> 22:54.000]  on Air Force One with grown adults because that distracts away from little kids getting
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.960]  kidnapped and raped which we've got confirmed man, guys put that down.
[22:58.960 --> 23:00.840]  I'm not ready to go to that.
[23:00.840 --> 23:04.640]  Don't put it up yet.
[23:04.640 --> 23:13.240]  I got to do a big, this has got to be done with major, major buildup, major, I've already
[23:13.240 --> 23:23.840]  vetted it but I just, I just cannot believe that we are actually in the grasp of these
[23:23.840 --> 23:24.840]  monsters.
[23:24.840 --> 23:29.720]  I mean it's so real folks.
[23:29.720 --> 23:36.240]  The deputy pope has been arrested, the number two guy in the Vatican for kidnapping and
[23:36.240 --> 23:44.200]  trafficking over a hundred little boys over 40 years and they use the kids to blackmail
[23:44.200 --> 23:50.800]  the Vatican so that the current black pope, Jesuit pope, who's really a communist could
[23:50.800 --> 23:58.760]  take control of the Vatican and that's all confirmed and I was telling some lawyers,
[23:58.760 --> 24:02.640]  my powered lawyers I was on the phone with from DC, some things were getting ready to
[24:02.640 --> 24:05.720]  do this week about it and they said, really?
[24:05.720 --> 24:08.520]  And I sent one of them the article while we were talking and he said, I can't believe
[24:08.520 --> 24:09.520]  it.
[24:09.520 --> 24:10.520]  I didn't even know that.
[24:10.520 --> 24:11.520]  That's what I mean.
[24:11.520 --> 24:15.880]  Like the deputy pope gets caught bringing in over a hundred little boys to compromise
[24:15.880 --> 24:16.880]  everybody.
[24:16.880 --> 24:21.400]  You bring in some little boy to me, I'm going to break your neck, what do you mean compromise?
[24:21.400 --> 24:23.200]  Where did they get all these people?
[24:23.200 --> 24:25.000]  How did they find so many people?
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.720]  Can you imagine somebody bringing a five-year-old girl in an address saying, hey, let's rape
[24:29.720 --> 24:30.720]  her?
[24:30.720 --> 24:32.360]  It's just like, what?
[24:32.360 --> 24:37.080]  It's like, who are you people and that's why I'm not afraid of these people.
[24:37.080 --> 24:43.480]  It's why I just want to spend my life judiciously and focus like a missile, like a weapon system
[24:43.480 --> 24:47.080]  to make sure that I take them out.
[24:47.080 --> 24:51.680]  That's my great frustration is that I pray to God to leave God and direct me, please
[24:51.680 --> 24:56.400]  Jesus and please Father, send the Holy Ghost, send the discernment.
[24:56.400 --> 24:59.120]  I know I've already got it, but I need more.
[24:59.120 --> 25:03.840]  I need God to just fully take control of me because I am a weak vessel, but God doesn't
[25:03.840 --> 25:04.840]  really do that.
[25:04.840 --> 25:11.000]  God gives you free will, but man, I just want to be sanctified, purified and raised up against
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.520]  the enemy, not out of any type of power trip.
[25:14.520 --> 25:17.800]  But because I've already committed myself to this, I know how dangerous it is.
[25:17.800 --> 25:20.400]  I want to defeat the enemy.
[25:20.400 --> 25:22.640]  I want to be worthy.
[25:22.640 --> 25:25.120]  Just knowing this stuff makes me feel bad.
[25:25.120 --> 25:29.720]  I feel evil just knowing all this stuff.
[25:29.720 --> 25:36.680]  I feel guilty for them and it's all the same people.
[25:36.680 --> 25:42.960]  They all have that same little demon look, little jolly look in their eyes.
[25:42.960 --> 25:46.600]  I mean, I was watching one of these guys on TV just yesterday and I thought, man, that
[25:46.600 --> 25:53.520]  guy looks like a pedophile and then holy Toledo, boom, there it is again.
[25:53.520 --> 25:56.400]  It's like, wow, they have a spirit.
[25:56.400 --> 25:57.760]  They have a look.
[25:57.760 --> 26:00.440]  They have a behavior and they can't hide it.
[26:00.440 --> 26:02.560]  They look like demons.
[26:02.560 --> 26:10.160]  They look like just seething power tripping, arrogant, greedy creatures.
[26:10.160 --> 26:13.680]  And the worst thing they can do is to hurt children.
[26:13.680 --> 26:18.080]  And so that's why they like it because it's all about them and all about them doing what
[26:18.080 --> 26:23.120]  they want and doing bad things because that gets them closer to their God.
[26:23.120 --> 26:27.000]  Like, I want to be a better person to get closer to God.
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.040]  They want to be worse to get close to their God.
[26:30.040 --> 26:31.040]  And that's what it is.
[26:31.040 --> 26:33.720]  They're devil worshiping pedophiles.
[26:33.720 --> 26:35.080]  I've got hundreds of stories.
[26:35.080 --> 26:36.080]  They're all riveting.
[26:36.080 --> 26:37.080]  It's all important.
[26:37.080 --> 26:41.960]  Tons of clips, guests coming on, research, all of it, but I just want to tell you again,
[26:41.960 --> 26:47.360]  they're facing people committed to evil, committed to being nasty.
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.160]  They'd go out of their way to screw somebody over.
[26:51.160 --> 26:54.160]  They'd go out of their way to hurt somebody who's innocent.
[26:54.160 --> 26:56.040]  That's who they are.
[26:56.040 --> 26:57.040]  And they're all their statements.
[26:57.040 --> 27:04.480]  We hate flyover country and we hate churches and we hate Christians and we hate God and
[27:04.480 --> 27:11.720]  all of this stuff.
[27:11.720 --> 27:12.920]  They mean it, man.
[27:12.920 --> 27:15.440]  They want to destroy you.
[27:15.440 --> 27:16.560]  That's where they're going.
[27:16.560 --> 27:17.880]  That's their destination.
[27:17.880 --> 27:18.880]  That's their God.
[27:18.880 --> 27:19.880]  That's their world.
[27:19.880 --> 27:25.080]  To have their way with you and your children and look what Hollywood does and the sexualization
[27:25.080 --> 27:26.080]  and all of it.
[27:26.080 --> 27:28.080]  They are the scum of the earth.
[27:28.080 --> 27:33.440]  Now I'm going to go to break and come back and get into the rest of the story on this.
[27:33.440 --> 27:38.840]  The missiles, the whole North Korea situation, which is going to war, okay?
[27:38.840 --> 27:40.360]  That whole thing's out of control.
[27:40.360 --> 27:41.720]  We need to turn this around.
[27:41.720 --> 27:47.560]  I feel very sorry for the North Korean people, but the North Korean leadership are just the
[27:47.560 --> 27:51.840]  same little demon cult that I guarantee you Kim Jong-un is a pedophile.
[27:51.840 --> 27:53.120]  We know he's a sex pervert.
[27:53.120 --> 27:57.960]  His dad had a seven-story pleasure palace with kidnapped underage women and stuff from
[27:57.960 --> 27:58.960]  Japan.
[27:58.960 --> 28:05.000]  I mean, they had hijacked planes to get women he wanted, Kim Jong-il.
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.360]  But please don't forget we've extended Cyber Week, but this says Cyber Week.
[28:08.360 --> 28:10.120]  We can't do this more than a few days.
[28:10.120 --> 28:12.200]  Dave Mann has sold out.
[28:12.200 --> 28:14.720]  Brain force is about to sell out.
[28:14.720 --> 28:16.320]  Winner's son has sold out.
[28:16.320 --> 28:20.000]  A bunch of things have sold out, so they're not for sale.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.080]  I'm keeping it at 50% off on brain force, even though it's close to selling out as we're

[29:29.200 --> 29:31.800]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[29:31.800 --> 29:32.800]  That's true.
[29:32.800 --> 29:36.640]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still
[29:36.640 --> 29:37.800]  alive?
[29:37.800 --> 29:41.400]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty
[29:41.400 --> 29:47.280]  and guarantees, no stock market risk, no tax risk, and no penalties.

[30:01.280 --> 30:04.200]  America is an information-based civil war.
[30:04.200 --> 30:07.640]  That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let
[30:07.640 --> 30:11.600]  these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[30:11.600 --> 30:17.960]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[30:17.960 --> 30:24.000]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[30:24.000 --> 30:25.000]  the counterculture.
[30:25.000 --> 30:31.760]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom
[30:31.760 --> 30:34.440]  who at the same time is tolerance.
[30:34.440 --> 30:39.240]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's class of the liberalism.
[30:39.240 --> 30:44.560]  They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote
[30:44.560 --> 30:45.560]  freedom worldwide.
[30:45.560 --> 30:51.120]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as

[31:03.200 --> 31:08.600]  Our b-vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels, up-up-up-up-up
[31:08.600 --> 31:09.600]  optimum levels.
[31:09.600 --> 31:14.320]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of b-vitamins we need
[31:14.320 --> 31:19.320]  every day, up-up-up-up-up-up optimum levels, b-vitamins we need every day.
[31:19.320 --> 31:25.160]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin b-12 for optimal absorption, up-up-up-up-up
[31:25.160 --> 31:26.800]  optimal absorption.

[33:21.400 --> 33:40.920]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:40.920 --> 33:42.440]  Alex Jones here back live.
[33:42.440 --> 33:47.680]  You know when I talk about information overload, the media is trying to act like Project Veritas
[33:47.680 --> 33:52.400]  got caught with egg on its face for shitting a woman into infiltrate to show how they're
[33:52.400 --> 33:55.440]  biased concerning Judge Roy Moore.
[33:55.440 --> 33:59.800]  And then of course the Washington Post has run by leftist elements of the CIA publicly,
[33:59.800 --> 34:04.720]  that's now admitted and funded and owned by Jeff Bezos and an additional 500 million
[34:04.720 --> 34:11.000]  plus CIA dollars that Obama gave it one month before he left office criminally.
[34:11.000 --> 34:20.720]  But if you look at that and expand on it, now they have video that's up on infowars.com
[34:20.720 --> 34:25.000]  where the Washington Post national security reporter admits evidence of Russian collusion
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.560]  maybe doesn't exist at all and says it's all an effing crap shoot, we're just desperate
[34:31.560 --> 34:35.280]  to make something stick.
[34:35.280 --> 34:39.800]  So I mean that's the type of stuff we've got that we're going to be playing here today.
[34:39.800 --> 34:41.320]  It's total overload.
[34:41.320 --> 34:50.440]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump tweets well-known videos of Muslims in Libya, in Syria and in
[34:50.440 --> 34:52.920]  Egypt throwing gays off buildings.
[34:52.920 --> 34:57.560]  Those are real videos, they've not ever been denied, videos of Dutch children being beaten
[34:57.560 --> 35:04.880]  up by Muslims, reporters being beaten up, US media runs it and says Trump tweets what
[35:04.880 --> 35:08.920]  he claims is Muslims attacking people.
[35:08.920 --> 35:15.240]  We're Muslims doing bad things.
[35:15.240 --> 35:22.520]  So this is the type of garbage that's going on and this is the types of deception.
[35:22.520 --> 35:26.720]  So everybody knows that Islam takes over countries it comes into.
[35:26.720 --> 35:31.720]  Everybody knows they're hyping this whole anti-Americanism, anti-Europe garbage and
[35:31.720 --> 35:41.080]  I've got a bunch of news on that I'm going to get into where arrogant Jean Paul Junkers
[35:41.080 --> 35:46.080]  of the Nazi dynasty, I mean he's about a real Nazi, his grandfather took over Luxembourg,
[35:46.080 --> 35:54.320]  they still personally own it by right of just capturing it through military conquest, richest
[35:54.320 --> 35:56.600]  country per capita in the world Luxembourg.
[35:56.600 --> 36:01.560]  His grandfather took it, his father was a famous Nazi, he's reviving the EU that his
[36:01.560 --> 36:05.000]  grandfather actually envisioned for the Nazis.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.320]  Junkers grandfather is actually sourced as the guy that developed the plan for the Nazis.
[36:10.320 --> 36:15.840]  They're one of the most famous royal families of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire that existed
[36:15.840 --> 36:16.840]  previously.
[36:16.840 --> 36:22.760]  So they're German royalty, he's related to the British royals, all the rest of them
[36:22.760 --> 36:27.640]  and he says that we must have migrants, he says without millions of African migrants
[36:27.640 --> 36:30.440]  Europe will be lost, that's a close quote, here's another one.
[36:30.440 --> 36:33.880]  The Jean Paul Junker, migrants need legal ways to come to Europe, well you're already
[36:33.880 --> 36:35.880]  bringing them there, 10 million in the last few years.
[36:35.880 --> 36:39.680]  Meanwhile, Macron knows he's about to remove from office like Merkel is about to be if
[36:39.680 --> 36:44.560]  he doesn't act populist so he says African traffickers are responsible for Libya's slave
[36:44.560 --> 36:45.560]  trade.
[36:45.560 --> 36:50.920]  No, you are, your government is previously for overthrowing Libya and then now letting
[36:50.920 --> 36:56.520]  radical Muslims in that sell men, women and children in slavery, it's Islam.
[36:56.520 --> 37:02.880]  But no one will say it's Islam that's running modern slavery, instead it's like the anti-slavery
[37:02.880 --> 37:08.200]  group and we learn our morals from Linda Sorcerer when she's not talking about taking a pair
[37:08.200 --> 37:12.200]  of loppers to women's genitals.
[37:12.200 --> 37:18.280]  But here's the good news and I want to next hour read this in its entirety as statement.
[37:18.280 --> 37:26.760]  Day of reckoning FCC Chairman Ajit Pai slams Silicon Valley for censoring conservatives
[37:26.760 --> 37:33.880]  and says how dare you censor members of Congress on Twitter and Facebook and Google.
[37:33.880 --> 37:38.120]  How dare you talk about a free open internet when we had net neutrality and then Obama
[37:38.120 --> 37:45.320]  called it net neutrality last year and handed it over to the UN and multinationals and now
[37:45.320 --> 37:50.320]  you violated net neutrality under the name net neutrality and they play these semantical
[37:50.320 --> 37:51.320]  games.
[37:51.320 --> 37:56.160]  He says we're going back to where the US ran the internet because we created it.
[37:56.160 --> 38:01.080]  We're not giving it to the UN or George Soros's foundations because his foundations advises
[38:01.080 --> 38:07.240]  the UN and advises Google and advises Facebook and Twitter and pays.
[38:07.240 --> 38:12.280]  Go look it up for the groups that censor and delist in control.
[38:12.280 --> 38:16.680]  Soros is literally in control.
[38:16.680 --> 38:23.200]  His stinking $18 billion tax exempt money he swindled out of stock market crashes you
[38:23.200 --> 38:24.200]  name it.
[38:24.200 --> 38:30.280]  $18 billion separate from all his other wealth that he uses like a battering ram to try to
[38:30.280 --> 38:31.280]  destroy this country.
[38:31.280 --> 38:32.360]  Well guess what?
[38:32.360 --> 38:37.520]  Once people are aware of you no amount of your money will buy you the pissing contest
[38:37.520 --> 38:42.240]  you wanted to have Mr. Soros mounting America's hat on the wall.
[38:42.240 --> 38:44.680]  Hunting season's over for America.
[38:44.680 --> 38:51.240]  Hunting season politically is open on you buster and you're so stupid the stuff you're
[38:51.240 --> 38:55.020]  funding behind the scenes that we have all the intel on.
[38:55.020 --> 38:58.440]  You think we're going to have a one dimensional fight with you or we're just going to address
[38:58.440 --> 39:01.080]  what you're going to launch on us next week?
[39:01.080 --> 39:05.640]  We're going to hit you with all the intel we've been saving and all the angles and you're
[39:05.640 --> 39:09.560]  so dumb look at who you're going to use to go after us.
[39:09.560 --> 39:13.560]  This is a gift actually.
[39:13.560 --> 39:17.120]  Wait if they're dumb enough folks with what I'm going to announce the next week or two
[39:17.120 --> 39:18.120]  to you.
[39:18.120 --> 39:20.400]  You'll see it announced by the media first with their spin on it.
[39:20.400 --> 39:26.720]  I mean it's crazy when you see who they're dumb enough to publicly send after me you're
[39:26.720 --> 39:28.680]  not going to believe it.
[39:28.680 --> 39:36.720]  You're not going to believe it.
[39:36.720 --> 39:39.560]  You know I'm two inches away from just releasing all this tomorrow.
[39:39.560 --> 39:47.800]  I think I'm going to do that.
[39:47.800 --> 39:50.160]  What's crazy is they've been pushing third world countries around.
[39:50.160 --> 39:53.720]  They've been pushing Muslims around using radical Muslims and they've had it so long
[39:53.720 --> 39:57.680]  with air superiority and arrogance that these people thought they could do anything they
[39:57.680 --> 40:04.360]  wanted however whenever and they just don't get the tide has turned against you massive
[40:04.360 --> 40:10.920]  and you're sitting there figuring it out as waves 10 times 20 times 30 times 100 times
[40:10.920 --> 40:12.520]  a thousand times.
[40:12.520 --> 40:17.480]  I'm actually scared of the waves coming in the change is going to be so dramatic and
[40:17.480 --> 40:21.720]  you arrogant SOB's still haven't figured it out.
[40:21.720 --> 40:25.320]  So that's all coming up but good stuff's happening.
[40:25.320 --> 40:31.240]  Pi has votes to repeal Obamacare Obama era net neutrality rules.
[40:31.240 --> 40:32.240]  Really scary news though.
[40:32.240 --> 40:33.240]  I told you this was coming.
[40:33.240 --> 40:34.240]  I told you it was coming.
[40:34.240 --> 40:38.880]  I told you it was coming a decade ago and Soros was behind the whole marijuana legalization
[40:38.880 --> 40:43.640]  deal and then the way they wrote the regulations that his group wrote for all those states was
[40:43.640 --> 40:50.200]  at 18 states now that are more like 24 have somewhat of legalization.
[40:50.200 --> 40:54.520]  It turns you into a war to the state when you sign the paperwork your children and your
[40:54.520 --> 40:56.200]  guns are taken.
[40:56.200 --> 41:00.780]  Look at this daily caller Hawaiian police order people with medical pot to surrender
[41:00.780 --> 41:06.720]  guns to state police.
[41:06.720 --> 41:08.920]  Contrast that with Trump.
[41:08.920 --> 41:14.120]  Trump to permit citizens to buy army surplus pistols reversing something Obama did six
[41:14.120 --> 41:17.080]  years ago banning all military surplus from being sold to public.
[41:17.080 --> 41:18.840]  Now the military can make money.
[41:18.840 --> 41:23.040]  The citizens get high quality barretta firearms at a very very low price and just on having
[41:23.040 --> 41:29.600]  to house the guns will save the US $200,000 a day.
[41:29.600 --> 41:37.200]  So that's all coming up but first just briefly I put a good face on this because that's what
[41:37.200 --> 41:42.520]  needs to be done and in reality that's the way to be optimistic and understand the destiny
[41:42.520 --> 41:47.560]  understand history but also politically using the truth know how to defeat the globals on
[41:47.560 --> 41:49.400]  every front.
[41:49.400 --> 41:53.760]  But it takes number one prayer number two spreading the articles and the videos to get around
[41:53.760 --> 41:59.760]  the enemy at news wars dot com info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and it takes
[41:59.760 --> 42:04.240]  you being vocal and calling C span and calling talk radio or calling your local affiliates
[42:04.240 --> 42:08.520]  and thanking them or becoming sponsors it just calls for your optimism and your energy
[42:08.520 --> 42:13.640]  and your focus and when you get off the couch when you get off the porch you're unstoppable
[42:13.640 --> 42:17.440]  and it calls for financial support and if you need water filtration the very best or
[42:17.440 --> 42:23.360]  air filtration or water filtration for your showers or bathtubs or clothes or or or survival
[42:23.360 --> 42:28.840]  gear or high quality supplements whatever the very best highest rate is is we go out and

[46:12.800 --> 46:18.960]  is clear both Senator Franken and Congressman Conyers must resign now and Congress must
[46:18.960 --> 46:23.960]  end taxpayer funded payouts to harassment victims in an effort to silence their voices
[46:23.960 --> 46:28.880]  and complaints one of the women is just the latest to come forward accusing former president
[46:28.880 --> 46:33.920]  Bill Clinton of sexual crimes Leslie Milley said she was very prepared to come forward
[46:33.920 --> 46:38.440]  and talk about her encounters with Bill Clinton in the eighties but once the Monica Lewinsky
[46:38.440 --> 46:43.480]  story broke she feared not only the media storm that would result but also Hillary Clinton
[46:43.480 --> 46:49.440]  herself Senator Franken is facing backlash for his lame attempt at an apology while Congressman
[46:49.440 --> 46:55.040]  Conyers has stepped down as ranking member of House Judiciary Committee so far both lawmakers
[46:55.040 --> 47:04.080]  have refused to resign leon macadoo info wars dot com you're listening to the alex jones
[47:04.080 --> 47:21.760]  show
[47:21.760 --> 47:46.720]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[47:46.720 --> 48:14.200]  that's from the family guy five years ago and the reason I raise that is you've got
[48:14.200 --> 48:40.960]  the
[48:40.960 --> 48:45.760]  They're smoke screening. They're watering down the overall story. It's an admitted tactic.
[48:46.800 --> 48:53.920]  But why is Matt Lauer being burned? I'm not defending what he's reportedly done. It's a smoke
[48:53.920 --> 48:59.760]  screen. Matt Lauer is a failure in the ratings. Matt Lauer is a failure, just like Charlie Rose,
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.240]  just like all these people. And so they've known about these cases. This is now admitted for years.
[49:05.920 --> 49:09.680]  But now they green light. It's safe to go public. More women go public.
[49:09.680 --> 49:14.640]  It's first it's one, then it's two, then it's five. And then now, oh, they're the good guys,
[49:14.640 --> 49:18.240]  they're the executives, they got rid of them. But where are the executives?
[49:19.760 --> 49:24.720]  Notice Trump tweeted about Matt Lauer last night, but said, you should investigate the head of NBC
[49:24.720 --> 49:34.000]  and his behavior. See, Trump's going at the heart of it. They're burning people like Matt Lauer and
[49:34.000 --> 49:45.520]  Charlie Rose for a woman walking by their studio, their dressing room and seeing them in their underwear
[49:47.440 --> 49:51.600]  or hitting on somebody when they're drunk at the Olympics. And I'm not defending any of it.
[49:51.600 --> 49:55.920]  But they're taking that now and using it to cover up what the executives are doing.
[49:55.920 --> 49:58.720]  Let me tell you, the executives are on the wide body jets.
[49:58.720 --> 50:05.840]  The executives like Schmidt of Google will be seen with 15 women getting on the big jet with
[50:05.840 --> 50:10.240]  hoods over their heads. He has bags put over their heads just like Michael Jackson would do to people
[50:10.240 --> 50:18.240]  so you can't tell who they are. See, so they're the royalty and they're just burning the lower
[50:18.240 --> 50:22.560]  folks. Weinstein's an executive, but his brother was sick of him. His brother pulled the trigger.
[50:22.560 --> 50:27.200]  This whole thing was planned. They couldn't contain it anymore. So they decided to engineer
[50:27.200 --> 50:31.120]  this whole event. And now you're seeing my breakdown of this confirmed.
[50:32.960 --> 50:36.960]  The failed dead weight of the media that couldn't deliver the election for Hillary,
[50:36.960 --> 50:42.640]  that couldn't get rid of Trump, they're now cutting bait. They can't reel back in the line.
[50:42.640 --> 50:48.080]  It's caught in the undergrowth at the bottom of the ocean, at the bottom of the lake,
[50:48.080 --> 50:50.880]  at the bottom of the river, at the bottom of the fjord, at the bottom of the lock,
[50:50.880 --> 50:58.640]  at the bottom of the fjord. And they are going to just cut the line. They're cutting bait right
[50:58.640 --> 51:05.280]  now. They're throwing in the towel. NBC fires Matt Lauer over sexual misconduct allegation.
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.760]  But notice they had other creepy shows about him hitting on women and
[51:09.760 --> 51:14.160]  grabbing on women and Katie Couric flashback. Matt Lauer pinches me on the butt a lot.
[51:14.160 --> 51:21.280]  In fact, here she is saying it. Did the Today Show with Matt Lauer for 15 years.
[51:21.280 --> 51:27.920]  What is Matt's most annoying habit? He pinches me on the ass a lot.
[51:30.800 --> 51:33.920]  So there you go. They all knew nothing was done.
[51:35.680 --> 51:40.400]  Because now if you got an oil field fire, Reddider learned this almost 100 years ago.
[51:40.400 --> 51:45.280]  If you got an oil field fire going, you can't put it out with water. You can't throw dirt on it.
[51:45.280 --> 51:50.800]  You got to roll up a big old wheelbarrow dynamite. You got to have a brave guy who's willing to do it.
[51:51.600 --> 51:56.000]  Believe me, he gets steak and beer bought from every night. And he runs that wheelbarrow in
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.440]  there with a lit fuse right into that fire. And he runs back and jumps behind an armored barrier.
[52:01.440 --> 52:08.880]  And boom, an explosion goes off and cuts that oil oil fire off. So they're using a controlled
[52:08.880 --> 52:16.000]  demolition to smoke screen. And the facts are all there. Now where to go with all these clips?
[52:16.000 --> 52:20.880]  Because I've got a bunch of them. Matt Lauer grills Bill O'Reilly on sexual assault.
[52:20.880 --> 52:27.840]  Yeah, he's the guy that brought up the recording of Trump saying women just throw themselves on you.
[52:27.840 --> 52:31.840]  And then using the example of you can do anything you want, like women throwing themselves at Elvis,
[52:31.840 --> 52:37.120]  throwing their panties at him. Elvis wasn't raping those women. They were throwing themselves up on
[52:37.120 --> 52:43.440]  you. It even ended up coming up in my cussie trial of my children. I was saying, Trump's saying that
[52:43.440 --> 52:48.320]  didn't right, but it's in a locker room. A woman throws themselves on you and you touch them.
[52:48.320 --> 52:53.200]  That's not assault. If she starts saying, stop, then it is. But if someone's throwing themselves
[52:53.200 --> 52:58.240]  on you, then it's not assault. The media spotted that I said it's okay to rape women. No, a woman
[52:58.240 --> 53:06.480]  throwing themselves on you. And then you touching them to see if they want more. That's normal
[53:06.480 --> 53:12.880]  interaction. The motor's running. She wants to go. That's how it works.
[53:15.440 --> 53:20.640]  You see, oh, how far I'm attracted to her. How far she want to go. That's normal. They turn that
[53:20.640 --> 53:26.800]  into a criminal action, ladies and gentlemen. Meanwhile, they're involved in sex trafficking,
[53:26.800 --> 53:32.480]  raping, covering it up using intelligence agencies, Mossad, leftist arms of the Mossad.
[53:32.480 --> 53:41.760]  NBC fires Matt Lauer over sexual misconduct. Matt Lauer allegedly sexually assaulted staffer
[53:41.760 --> 53:47.920]  during the Olympics. Matt Lauer fired by NBC for multiple sex misconduct claims. Now,
[53:47.920 --> 53:53.600]  the dam's breaking. NBC fires Matt Lauer after complaint about inappropriate sexual behavior.
[53:53.600 --> 53:59.120]  And then boom, Harvey Weinstein now faces sex trafficking charges in New York,
[53:59.120 --> 54:10.080]  and DC, and in LA. Second staffer accuses Conyers of sexual harassment. Black caucus members urge
[54:10.080 --> 54:17.120]  U.S. Representative Conyers to resign. Former Conyers aide, most of us have seen him in his
[54:17.120 --> 54:28.400]  underwear, CNN. Sex victims demand Frank and Conyers resign. Isn't that interesting, ladies
[54:28.400 --> 54:35.120]  and gentlemen? But meanwhile, Clinton ignores Democrats when asked about alleged sexual harassment
[54:35.120 --> 54:42.480]  in politics. NBC News fires Matt Lauer again, but she's all silent because she didn't just
[54:42.480 --> 54:48.400]  represent child molesters. She represented brutal child rapists and loved it and made jokes about
[54:48.400 --> 54:53.920]  it because these are monster people. You go prove in politics as a lawyer, you're evil,
[54:53.920 --> 54:59.040]  when the first jobs you got are representing child rapists. You know, a whole bunch of men
[54:59.040 --> 55:03.840]  kidnapping 11-year-old girl, rape her half to death, shatter her cervix, ruin her, never gonna
[55:03.840 --> 55:10.160]  have children again. They think that's funny. It's all about her. It's about her power over you,
[55:10.160 --> 55:14.640]  and what's in the WikiLeaks, how she wants to keep you desperate and alone and in your mama's
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.880]  basement, and how much she hates you. So if you're delusional and go along with that, that's your
[55:18.880 --> 55:25.200]  issue. When I come back though, I'm gonna play bizarre satire clip of NBC female host catching
[55:25.200 --> 55:30.800]  Matt Lauer in underwear. Women says he's making her lactate. So they make a weird, you know,
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.440]  mixed children in that makes it more fun. 50 shades of Matt Lauer, Ellen DeGeneres prank,
[55:36.080 --> 55:42.720]  Matt Lauer grills Bill O'Reilly on sexual assault. It's all coming up as the chickens come home to
[55:42.720 --> 55:48.960]  roost. And then I'm getting into the really serious news. That's North Korea, the new ICBM test,
[55:49.520 --> 55:54.880]  a lot of top military brass, as well as Senator Graham, who's on the armed services committee
[55:54.880 --> 56:01.200]  and extremely powerful in that area, saying that it's moving towards total war. That's all coming
[56:01.200 --> 56:06.640]  up, ladies and gentlemen, in the second hour. And I tend to open the phones up and I intend to get
[56:06.640 --> 56:13.360]  more into Trump delivering again, 3.3% growth rate in the economy. That gets some howling mad
[56:13.360 --> 56:19.840]  even more. Day of reckoning FCC chairman, Ajay Pai slam Silicon Valley for sensory conservatives.
[56:19.840 --> 56:24.000]  Finally, it's happening. Absolutely. They got antitrust problems. They're the ones talking
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.240]  about free open internet. They're the ones turning us into the communist Chinese net system.
[56:29.600 --> 56:34.080]  They had it where the FCC would control all political thought even online. If Hillary would
[56:34.080 --> 56:40.960]  have gotten elected and Mr. Pai is reversing all that, he's a hero. Hip hip hooray for Mr. Pai.
[56:41.760 --> 56:46.400]  Amazing. Remember, it's an act of rebellion against their censorship. It's ongoing. When
[56:46.400 --> 56:50.800]  you spread the links, the live feeds on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, infowars.com, forward slash
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.960]  show. However you're watching right now, local stations, pull over at that red light, tell folks

[57:00.000 --> 57:05.120]  word. It's people power. It's word of mouth. That's what is unstoppable. And don't forget,
[57:06.240 --> 57:10.480]  funding us is allowing us to weather the attacks and grow in the face of the attacks

[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:25.680]  You know, I think it's better just to play these videos back to back to illustrate the hypocrisy
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:30.000]  of Matt Lauer being terminated. Charlie Rose, a lot more is coming.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.680]  Hundreds of people have had to resign or been fired. And now just an accusation does it.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.080]  Well, it's because they already know it's true. They've been sitting on it. But now this group
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:49.520]  of politicians, this group of media whores have failed the globalist. You failed me for the last
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:56.880]  time, Lauer. And they're flushing them down the commode of history. The mercenaries failed.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.560]  And now they're being blown out the airlock. Now let's play these clips back to back.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.880]  It's a sad morning here at today and at NBC News. Just moments ago, NBC News Chairman Andy
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.080]  Lac sent the following note to our organization. Dear colleagues, on Monday night, we received a
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.560]  detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.880]  by Matt Lauer. It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company's standards.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.600]  As a result, we have decided to terminate his employment. While it is the first complaint
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.960]  about his behavior in the over 20 years he has been at NBC News, we were also presented with
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:38.320]  reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident. Our highest priority is to
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:43.360]  create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected and to ensure that any
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:49.360]  actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences no matter who the offender.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:55.200]  We are deeply saddened by this turn of events, but we will face it together as a news organization
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:01.440]  and do it in as transparent a manner as we can. That is the statement from our chairman, Andy Lac.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.160]  And we just learned this moments ago, just this morning. As I'm sure you can imagine,
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.840]  we are devastated and we are still processing all of this. And I will tell you right now,
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.640]  we do not know more than what I just shared with you. But we will be covering this story
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.960]  as reporters, as journalists. I'm sure we will be learning more details in the hours and days
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:28.640]  to come. And we promise we will share that with you. And Hoda, I mean, you know, for the moment,
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.520]  all we can say is that we are heartbroken. I'm heartbroken for Matt. He is my dear,
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.640]  dear friend and my partner. And he is beloved by many, many people here. And I'm heartbroken
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:44.400]  for the brave colleague who came forward to tell her story and any other women who have their own
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.560]  stories to tell. And we are grappling with a dilemma that so many people have faced these
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:56.560]  past few weeks. How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:02.240]  behaved badly? And I don't know the answer to that. But I do know that this reckoning that
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:08.720]  so many organizations have been going through is important. It's long overdue. And it must result
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:15.520]  in workplaces where all women, all people feel safe and respected. As painful as it is this
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:22.400]  moment in our culture and this change had to happen. Reallocation in this area is a conviction.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.360]  They don't look at the truth. But think about those five women and what they did. They came
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:33.600]  forward and filed complaints against the biggest star at the network they worked at. Think of how
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.400]  intimidating that must have been, how nerve wracking that must have been. Doesn't that tell you how
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:44.240]  strongly they felt about the way they were treated by you? Well, it's not just me. Those lawsuits
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:52.800]  involve many other people, not just me. So I don't know, I'm not going to speculate about intent or
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.640]  why people did what they did. But you don't have this story, Laura. Correct. The lawsuits involved
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:07.040]  many people. Many people. But you were also named in a few of them. A few of them. Let me put a period
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:12.480]  on it this way, Bill, by asking you over the last six months, since you're firing, have you done some
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:18.880]  soul searching? Have you done some self-reflection and have you looked at the way you treated
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.200]  women that you think now or think about differently now than you did at the time?
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.560]  My conscience is clear. What I have done is organized a legal team to get the truth to the
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:37.520]  American people. So if you go to Newsmax... All right, folks, we're going to go to break. Literally,
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.480]  they are engaged in nine of the long knives flushing their own people into the dustbin of
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:50.320]  history right now. Now the Prairie Home Companion radio host has been sacked over supposedly
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:55.120]  improper behavior. This is a purge. This is the globalist getting rid of all their prostitutes.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:03.520]  It's pathetic. America is an information-based civil war. That's why now, more than ever,
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.400]  we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:14.400]  down from their bullying. We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:21.200]  dictatorship. Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:28.960]  is truly the counterculture. The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism,
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:35.120]  and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:41.120]  Geverson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.800]  like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more than 60 original designs of high
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:53.280]  quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot Feral at infowarstore.com. Be part
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:59.280]  of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:29.920]  I'm going to open the phones up for first-time callers again today, specifically on
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:39.520]  the hysteria going on in the country of individuals being accused with sexual harassment, sexual
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:46.880]  impropriety, snaring many really guilty people, but also going after a lot of innocent people.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.640]  Why is the leftist globalist media suddenly so concerned about all this?
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:59.360]  Well, it's because their giant media combine isn't working. ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC,
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:10.320]  NPR, PBS. They're flushing all the big name stars, because they're not stars. They're artificial
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:21.520]  celebrities created to sell globalism and to create illusions in the minds of weak-minded out
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:27.360]  there to buy into their so-called modernist, postmodernist, globalist worldview that's really
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:34.720]  just corporate slavery and complete emptiness. Garrison Keylor, is that how you pronounce him?
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:42.800]  I can't listen to his voice. Keylor fired for alleged improper behavior by Minnesota
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:51.360]  public radio. Garrison Keylor, oh, he's so fake. Oh, how you doing? The former host of a prairie
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:57.120]  home companion says he's been fired by Minnesota public radio over allegations of improper behavior.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.120]  Keylor told the Associated Press of his firing in an email. In a follow-up statement, he says he
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.760]  was fired over a story that I think is more interesting and more compelling than the version
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:12.400]  Minnesota public radio heard. He didn't give details of the allegation. Minnesota public
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:18.720]  radio didn't immediately respond to messages. Keylor retired last year from his longtime radio
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:26.080]  show, but he still produced the Writers' Almanac recidivation. There you go. Throw all the old
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:34.480]  deadwood overboard and stop paying him royalties on airing his stupid prairie home companion or
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.880]  whatever it is. The minute I hear that driving across country, sometimes you continue to NPR
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.120]  and at least hear the propaganda, but you hear that and it's just like, oh, let me hit the button
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:47.760]  as fast as possible. I mean, if you want Alzheimer's, they say listening to that will give it to you
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:53.360]  in five minutes. I mean, if you want to die, listen to this guy. That's cold satire. I'm not serious.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:09:00.960]  Associated Press, Reuters, New York Times. Alex Jones says listening to Jarrison Keylor
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:08.400]  will kill you. No, that's not what I was saying. So this firestorm just intensifies and it's been
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:14.720]  reported in the LA Times and the New York Times that the police are now in both cities looking
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:21.520]  at sex trafficking and kidnapping for Harvey Weinstein. And boy, it is his big cover-up
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:27.200]  using foreign intelligence agencies and police department people and detectives and folks threatening
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:33.360]  people. All the big house of cards is coming down and once one big guy starts falling, they all
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:37.840]  start falling and then all the other cowards run for the exits and can't wait to throw somebody
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:43.760]  onto the bus while he pinched my rear end once. Well, they execute him. But the real reason they're
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:49.360]  doing it is their failures. They have no ratings. They're overrated. It's all over. And so now
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:55.280]  they're just going to sue Donald Trump 3,000 times and sue me 100 times and sue everybody else
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.440]  and try to intimidate and sue your church if you've got an activity sitting out front or
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:04.560]  sue the city if they let kids hand out Christmas cards or sue the principal if he lets somebody
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.960]  in their commencement speech say, I love God. When it's your free speech, say whatever you want.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.840]  Separation church in state means we don't have a state-run religion called liberalism or Islam
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.320]  or whatever you want to call a state-run religion. Doesn't mean I can't get up there as a valovictorian
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:24.000]  or the salutatorian or as the captain of the football team or the head of the drama team and
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.960]  say, I love Jesus Christ. But it's all their intimidation, all their ignorance, all their fraud
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.960]  trying to manipulate us and it's all coming to an end because people are finally bucking them and
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:44.240]  saying, not just no, but absolutely no further. You shall not pass. He's the allegory of the
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:50.880]  ballerog coming across the chasm over the stone bridge and you don't know how this is going to
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:11:01.920]  end, but you let him know. You shall not pass. You're going through us. And of course, as allegories
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:08.560]  and cliches tend to be true, metaphysically you tend to fall with your great nemesis.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:16.560]  But through the fall, you ascend. Evil falls and it's destroyed when it hits the bottom.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:23.200]  When we fall, we rise even stronger and that's the great animating contest. It's why anybody that
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:28.560]  really studies history or studies the spiritual world or studies just the way forces work in the
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:33.200]  universe, you should want to go through that fire even though it's not going to be comfortable
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:40.560]  while you're doing it like lifting weights or running a marathon. But if you fall in combat
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:48.000]  with these people, you are risen up again. The example is Jesus Christ physically risen or Lazarus
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:55.920]  risen as an archetypal example for us, but we are spiritually risen again, but also in life.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:04.560]  Everything is a reflection of the great final moment before God. And so you experience all
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:15.200]  this in little ways as above so below. Now, let me get into the really, really, really,
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:21.920]  really serious news. North Korea. You know, people say, oh, we're always hearing about
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.800]  missile tests. We're always hearing about Japanese boats being hijacked or US trips
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:32.080]  being taken hostage. And it's just kind of, you know, that's North Korea since 1953, July 27th.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:41.600]  This has been going on forever. And so Alex, stop saying we have nuclear war. Stop fair
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:46.400]  mongering. I'm not fair mongering, but when I go to sleep at night, one of the main things that I
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:54.480]  worry about for myself and my family is North Korea. The other thing is car wrecks. I know
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.400]  statistically car wrecks are the number one things to end up killing you or your children or maiming
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:04.160]  them. But I look at North Korea and I look at historically how we're still at war with them.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.760]  And I look at all the weapons they've got and the fact that even broken away to a great extent
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:13.280]  from China and the fact that they tested an ICBM and that was successful and anywhere in the
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:21.120]  US, most areas of the world and the fact that they're so arrogant and so mentally ill and that
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.720]  Kim Jong-un is killing about all of his top generals and people just to keep them in line.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.280]  The starvation is increasing and ghost boats are constantly floating up on the Japanese
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.000]  coast full of skeletons. Not even people that tried to
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:44.160]  escape from Japan. It's always eight people on board because that's what the military puts on
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:51.040]  as citizens and they say you got this little bitty sail that's a third, you know, as big as it
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:58.720]  should be so you can't get away and you got to go out until you bring back fish, a certain amount
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.520]  or we shoot you. And so they just lay out on the boat and say, well, why go back? They're just
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.160]  going to kill us and they just die. Hundreds of these boats in the last decade wash up,
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.120]  a whole bunch of them just washed up this week and they're just skeletons.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:18.400]  Skeletons, it'll be eight men and eight, I mean eight men or four men and four women
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.240]  and they're just skeletons just dead on these rotting ghost boats. You guys can search
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.840]  in that if you want to show TV viewers ghost boats, ghost ships wash up on Japanese coast
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:35.520]  and like biological android robots, they just go out and die because you don't come back without
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.400]  the fish and so then you just die out at sea and you just you don't come back and then sometimes
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.560]  they think the boats are out there for four or five years and just skeletons. They don't even
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:49.840]  run to Japan because Japan just turns you around and sends you back. So there you go. I think they
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.520]  do deserve political amnesty. You know, if North Koreans were getting here, I'd say bring them in.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.000]  They actually have a real political asylum here. They're leaving hell on earth.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.600]  But never does CNN say from the horrible communist regime ghost boats or oh these new Islamic attacks
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.920]  were Islamic attacks. You know, the daily church being blown up, the mosque being blown up because
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.920]  it's not radical enough. Hundreds dead, shot, bombed every day. Doesn't even hardly make our
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.800]  news and never do they say it's an Islamic attack and then Trump tweets out Islamic attacks or
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:24.160]  admit Islamic attacks and the news goes who knows if these are even real. I mean Muslims never
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.800]  kill anybody. Okay. Did you hear the one Trump just said he claimed Muslims blew something up?
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:37.040]  That's a really good one. Next pigs can fly. Why did the Muslim cross the road to blow up the church?
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.880]  Why did the Muslim cross back over the road to load their kid up and plaza explosives?
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:47.200]  Why did they walk back across the road to have their kid walk into a school and blow up people?
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:51.360]  Why they walk back across the road to rape their wife and cut their newborn daughter's
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:16:19.680]  genitals off when they ride back with North Korea?

[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:26.160]  popular universe of videos that include live action footage of children depicted in compromising
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.720]  situations. Big companies are now pulling advertising from YouTube after it was revealed
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.400]  that up to 100,000 predatory accounts have been leaving indecent comments on videos featuring
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.360]  children for at least a year. That's right, while the Google-owned platform has been censoring and
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:47.040]  demonetizing offensive political content for the last six months, pedophiles were completely left
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:52.160]  alone. Maybe YouTube should concentrate on cleaning its own house before declaring completely
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:58.080]  legitimate political content to be harmful or disturbing. Leanne McAdoo, infowars.com.
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:02.320]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:09.760]  with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids. One of
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:15.920]  them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:22.960]  proteins better. And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:29.040]  the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration. And we also have an everyday,
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:35.280]  extremely affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance. But all of these are the very
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:42.080]  cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:48.880]  price. That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price. When you

[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.760]  Texas Commence Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:39.520]  By the way, coming up in the next segment, President Trump has called for an investigation into
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:48.080]  Joe Scarborough and the mysterious death that took place at his office in Florida of his intern.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:56.400]  And Trump has also called for the investigation of the chairman of NBC for his sexual activities.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.000]  And as I've said, they're burning Matt Lauer. They're, you know, they're burning all these other
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.240]  people because they don't get ratings. They're not successful. They've been covering it all up
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:10.480]  for a long time. We're going to get to that coming up. Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:15.680]  inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace. But when will the top executives at NBC and Comcast
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:23.680]  be fired for putting out so much fake news? Check out Andy Lax Past. You want to fight?
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:29.280]  You blow up those who are going to get one and you're going to get my special attention. I can't
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:35.600]  wait. I've gone from being on the fence about this stuff to just right now. I'm just like a
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:45.040]  wild boar ready to go wild. My tusker is ready to gouge politically. There's nothing like the
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:50.080]  battle fury. You could feel it. The enemy's about to move on everybody in the next month.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:54.480]  They've already been moving, but they're about to move. And once we beat this attack, we're going
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:22:01.760]  to win. But there are other big problems that we're facing. And that's North Korea that I was just
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:08.080]  getting into. Mattis, North Korea's new ICBM can hit targets nearly anywhere in the world.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.840]  Also Graham on North Korea, and I don't like to agree with Senator Graham on a lot of stuff.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:20.880]  He's right. We're headed to war if things don't change. This is a big, big deal. North Korea
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:26.640]  launches ICBM in the Pacific Ocean. It went higher and further. Of any, they can track the
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.120]  trajectory. If they would have let it continue on, it could have hit anywhere in North America,
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:37.760]  probably anywhere in the world. As Secretary of Defense Mattis talked about. So right now,
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:45.120]  let's play that clip of Secretary of Defense Mattis. North Korean missile launch went higher
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:49.600]  than previous test. And it takes it to a whole new level. Here it is.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:55.360]  President Senator Speaker, a little over two and a half hours ago, North Korea launched
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:02.400]  an intercontinental ballistic missile. Yeah, it went higher, frankly, than any previous
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:08.000]  shot they've taken. It's a research and development effort on their part to continue building ballistic
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.560]  missiles that could threaten everywhere in the world, basically. And in response,
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:19.760]  the South Koreans have fired some pinpoint missiles out into the water to make certain
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:26.320]  North Korea understands that they could be taken under fire by our ally. But the bottom line is
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:32.960]  it's a continued effort to build a threat, serve a ballistic missile threat that engangers world
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.320]  peace, regional peace, and certainly the United States. Now let's go to this next clip.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:47.920]  State Department comments on North Korea's latest missile launch. Here it is.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:54.000]  The DPRK missile launch. And the Secretary would like to release this statement right now.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.760]  And then I'd be happy to take your questions. Yes, it is.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.920]  The United States strongly condemns North Korea's launch of what was likely an
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:09.040]  intercontinental ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan indiscriminately threatening its neighbors,
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:14.400]  the region, and global stability. The DPRK's relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and the
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:19.680]  means to deliver them must be reversed. Together, the international community must continue to send
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:25.120]  a unified message to North Korea that the DPRK must abandon its weapons of mass destruction
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:31.040]  programs. All nations must continue strong economic and diplomatic measures. In addition
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:36.000]  to implementing all existing UN sanctions, the international community must take additional
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.520]  measures to enhance maritime security, including the right to interdict maritime traffic,
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:47.440]  transporting goods to and from the DPRK. The United States in partnership with Canada will
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:52.800]  now convene a meeting of the United Nations Command sending states to include the Republic of
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.640]  Korea and Japan and other key affected countries to discuss how the global community can counter
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:05.040]  North Korea's threat to international peace. Diplomatic options remain viable and open for now.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:10.000]  The United States remains committed to finding a peaceful path to denuclearization
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.280]  and to ending belligerent actions taken by North Korea.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.480]  Now, I published a big article by Ron Paul yesterday on infowars.com
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.920]  calling for backing down from North Korea and pointing out that our sanctions mainly just
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.640]  hurt their people. And I showed that because this is a complex issue. I agree with Ron Paul
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:37.440]  to a great extent. But North Korea has broken all its previous deals,
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:43.680]  is menacing its neighbors and it could just let its people have a little bit of economic freedom
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.520]  and they'd be like South Korea, one of the wealthiest countries on earth. It's the same people.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.400]  They're smart. They're hardworking. They're focused. They're great mathematicians. The list goes on
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:26:00.800]  and on. And they are under a suffocating evil regime of a little demonic, inbred, third generation
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:06.720]  dictator who is threatening everybody and who is starting fights and who is kidnapping people from
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:13.920]  Japan and China and the U.S. and all of this. It's out of control. Trump didn't start this. We
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:22.240]  didn't start this. The Communist Chinese invaded Korea. And that's where all this came from.
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.880]  And we're still at war with them. And this is one of the biggest trigger points in the world
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:31.520]  right now. And it's a very serious situation. And people out there that say it isn't,
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:39.760]  just because this has been going on since 1950 and we've had a ceasefire since 53,
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:48.000]  it's coming to a head. And you hear the statements. In fact, we have the statement from Graham.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.920]  I don't know if I forgot. Yeah, let's play. This is Senator Lindsey Graham talking about how this
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:01.200]  is going to war. And that's the military's been told anytime get ready. And they basically have
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.360]  South Korean and U.S. military that have agreed to suicide missions. This is not a secret, by the
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.120]  way, North Korea knows this. We have military and others that have agreed to suicide missions.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:13.360]  That means more than a 50% likelihood you won't make it out to go in and kill him.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:21.200]  So Trump is really, I think, just changing course as the other course hasn't worked.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.720]  Ron Paul says, are they really a sponsor of terror? And he says they aren't.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.560]  And then he gives the reasons why we shouldn't go to war with them and why it's bad. No,
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.840]  they are sponsors of terror in the Middle East. They've been caught doing it. But I
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:37.120]  understand we shouldn't escalate this, but they shouldn't either. It's a two-way street. Here's
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:43.120]  Senator Graham. Does this latest intercontinental ballistic missile test bring North Korea to
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:48.800]  actually threatening the United States with a nuclear-tipped ICBM? I'll let the intelligence
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.080]  community give you that answer, but I believe every test puts them closer. And the president has said,
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.120]  we'll take care of it, not the United Nations, not China. We'll take care of it. And my hope is
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:04.000]  that North Korea will realize that he is serious about this. The president is not going to allow
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.760]  North Korea to have a nuclear weapon in their hands that can hit America with an ICBM that
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.240]  can make it to the United States. And if we have to go to war to stop this, we will. And if there's
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.120]  a war with North Korea, because North Korea brought it on itself, and we're headed toward a war,
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:24.880]  things don't change. But that could result in tens of thousands, about hundreds of thousands,
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:30.400]  maybe millions of casualties. There you go. You've been there. You understand. So that's where
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:36.640]  we are. This war could lead to millions of casualties. It probably will. And it's a serious
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:42.080]  issue. When we come back, I'm going to get into some good news straight ahead. Very exciting things
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.200]  happened with the new FCC chairman standing at the Google, Facebook, and Twitter and saying,
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:50.400]  look, you guys act like Communist Chinese. Knock it off right now. And we got Scarborough.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.080]  Trump wants him investigated for the mystery that happened down there at his office.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.120]  It's a no-brainer. A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period. You need a water

[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:09.680]  disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right? And does it all at only two

[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:26.160]  High cheekbones. Warren didn't self-identify as Native American until she was 38 years old.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:30.800]  She claimed that minority status for years in order to climb the academic ladder.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.880]  And this false information wasn't something she just claimed to the student, but Warren began
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:40.800]  putting it in her professional bios for years when law schools were hungry for minority faculty.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:46.160]  Foka-Hontas lied about being Native American in order to gain an unfair advantage in securing
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:51.360]  academic tenure. This means she actually stole that position from a real Native American who
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:31:16.880]  could have benefited from their minority status. Racist, Leanne McAdooInfoWars.com.

[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:57.520]  Let me give the number out to take your calls. It's 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.960]  We're doing first time callers. I want to get your take on North Korea,
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:07.520]  on Matt Lauer, on the purges, on all of it. There's also a report I want to get into here.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:11.200]  Trump says investigate Scarborough over death of intern.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:18.320]  I'm not saying Scarborough killed his intern, a young female, but it was always a mystery what
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:25.680]  happened. The president has a lot of information, a lot of sources, and he has been tweeting about that.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:32.080]  Kit Daniels article is on infowars.com. President sheds light on unusual circumstances
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:41.200]  of intern's death. He also says investigate the chairman of NBC for his personal activities.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:46.720]  Yeah, let's not just burn Brian Williams for fake news and Matt Lauer for bad ratings.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.040]  I mean, we're not saying what he did was okay, but it's even true.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:55.200]  We're saying we know what you're doing. More NPR firings, not just a prairie home companion
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:59.200]  guy's been fired, but now there are a bunch of other editors and people being fired over
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:04.720]  sexual harassment. Of course, they've known about all this forever. Katie Kirk said Matt Lauer used
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.880]  to pinch her rear end. She has different words for that. But the point is, is that
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.600]  now they're going to use all that to get rid of all the bloat, all the dead wood.
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:22.400]  Time magazine just laid off 50% of its employees or Time Inc. They're imploding. They're a joke.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:29.520]  And out of time in Newsweek respond, they say, Alex Jones says no one was killed in Vegas.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:36.960]  Total lie, total lie, total lie. And then I think there's slave colonies of Martians. Never said it.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:42.960]  No video, no audio, no text. Lies, lies. Jones believes the Loch Ness Monster. Jones believes
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.400]  you see where he believes in Bigfoot. That's the guy that covers Bigfoot. They think you're so dumb.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:54.720]  They go, oh, that's the guy that covers Bigfoot. No, I'm the one with the sources.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.200]  So much that just keeps sending the info. But I mean,
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.080]  other people say, why didn't you do something with this or do something with that?
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:08.960]  And, you know, quite frankly, I'm not just here to break big stories.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:13.840]  I'm here to break the big stories that actually have attacked the globalist and exposed their
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:21.200]  system. I don't hold back on stories, but, you know, gay orgies on Air Force One. I mean,
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:28.800]  I mean, you could just feel you're asking to get killed with that story. And I told the reporters
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.720]  that have it. I just said, why don't you just release that? And it's not like I'm even afraid of it.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.880]  It's like, I got like a spider sensor. Just a certain point like I'm willing to risk my life
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:43.360]  to it all the time. But it's just like consenting adults. But it also gets into the black male.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:48.800]  It also gets into the control, you know, it's all going to come out. Gay sex in the motorcade,
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:58.080]  certain well-known actor. Bill Clinton rolling on the window going, yeah, I'm fun back there.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:02.720]  I like girls, but boy, you do a good job at that. Maybe I'll let you do that to me.
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.520]  But see, I don't have to release it. Other people are.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:16.640]  But you better know my phones are tapped and you better know they're mad at me. And so all I'm
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.440]  asking listeners is to think about that and understand that and pray for us because that'll
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:28.240]  give us the discernment and the provisions we need spiritually, mentally, financially. You name
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:32.800]  it to go through this because we are at the center of this and the enemy knows it and they've got to
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.640]  worry every minute that we're about to release. We're about to say we're about to do, but I feel
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.520]  better. I feel safer because I want to feel safe. I'll rest my life if I have to, but I don't want
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:45.920]  to be the tip of the spear all the time. And so it feels so good to see all these other prominent
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:53.040]  people out there that are telling the truth and taking action and doing all these things because
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:02.160]  I know we're all safer as more of us stand up as more of us do the right thing. The Mark Twain
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:08.320]  quote comes to mind. In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.880]  But in time when his cause succeeds, the timid joined him because then it cost nothing to be
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.720]  a patriot. So I'm going to hit this amazingly positive news and take some of your phone calls
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:26.560]  coming up here in the next segment, 877-789-2539 and get into the FCC chairman. But just briefly,
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:35.280]  we are going to have to end. Well, some of these specials have already ended four or five of the
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:42.560]  items as they sold out like Winter Sun, Caveman, and others. But Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver,
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:47.120]  highest quality, 6 or 7% off. Nobody does that. That's the main thing you see sold in Whole Foods.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:52.480]  It's the highest quality. Visa sells it for $19 and $25. We sell it for normally $15. It's a great
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:57.120]  deal at $9.95, which is unprecedented. Brain Force Plus, the amazing Neutropic, 50% off,
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:01.440]  and free shipping on all these items. Survival Shield X2, the amazing Good Halogen, the opposite

[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.720]  And you can also call toll 3 and ask about all the specials.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:22.400]  Triple, eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And until five o'clock every day, our crew
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.480]  at the Warehouse Building, I said we're in the Broadcast Building. That's in a different area
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:32.880]  of Austin. They take the orders, answer your questions, and are awesome folks. And we have
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:36.080]  an answering service we've had for 20 years that takes your orders after that. They do a pretty
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:40.560]  good job. They just can't tell you all about the New World Order or what color socks I wore today,
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.160]  but what color shoes or whatever. I mean, they're not here with us, but they're here in Austin.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:50.080]  And it's a good outfit. So 24 hours a day, you can call and get your questions answered about
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.480]  items or about products. You know, they can't ask you about the status of an order or things like
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:00.000]  that because it's an order service doing an after five, but they can do that during the day here
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.560]  with the Santa's Little Helpers we have across town here. Also, we've got free shipping again,
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:13.040]  as I said, sounded for auto shipping additional 10% off. And then that locks in the low price of
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:18.320]  the sale at the time and additional 10% off in perpetuity. Because even if something's sold
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:22.720]  out, we hold back for everybody that has auto ship back there in the warehouse on the pallets,
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:28.240]  so that you never don't get your brain force or get your, the real red pill or other great
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:36.080]  systems that we have at infowarstore.com. And again, it is an act of buying war bonds,
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:40.320]  an act of resisting the enemy to support us and buy the great products. So again,
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:46.320]  thank you all for what you do. Okay, here's the report that's up on news wars.com and
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:53.920]  presidentplanet.com. Trump says investigate Scarborough over death of intern president
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:59.920]  sheds light on unusual circumstances of interns death in response. And of course he's also called
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:07.840]  him psycho Joe in response to Matt Lowers revelations. President Trump said MSNBC host
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.840]  Joe Scarborough should also be investigated for the unsolved mystery close quote,
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:16.320]  likely referring to the death of intern Lori
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:25.040]  closutes in 2001. He left Congress after that and for working for MSNBC went from being a
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:31.440]  conservative to an establishment man. And hey, what was the alternative?
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.720]  And will they terminate low rating Joe Scarborough based on the unsolved mystery that
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:42.480]  took place in Florida years ago? Investigate tweeted the president on Wednesday morning.
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:51.600]  How incredibly awesome and just fabulous is it to have somebody who's taken the gloves off and
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:58.160]  who's put brass knuckles on? And he says investigate the chairman of NBC for his activity with women
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.200]  and others. You see, oh, you want to kill the president, you want to overthrow it, you want to
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:07.520]  get me, you want to put me in prison, they got MSNBC hosting, you know, lock up all the
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:11.760]  conservatives, lock up the Trump people. Once we get power, we're going to put you all in prison.
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:17.520]  Hey, we understand that. Like we see that guy up. We understand where you're going,
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:22.240]  what you're doing. We understand your mission. We got it. We got you're not giving us quarter.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:29.520]  None offered, none given back. We got it. You want to bang heads? You want to bang heads?
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:36.000]  Boom, baby. Boom. It's going to happen. Okay. I'm going to get into pie after I take some
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:41.040]  of your phone calls. I don't mean pumpkin pie. Day of reckoning, FCC chairman,
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.200]  Ajit Pai, an incredible individual, slam Silicon Valley for Centering Conservatives.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:51.360]  I just want to say I'm so thankful to Trump. This is so good. This is so right. This is so amazing.

[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.760]  prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people

[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:29.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Our info war is live as I call it. I'm your host.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.600]  Owen Schreuer is coming up at three o'clock central today with the war room and of course David
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:41.120]  Knight with the David Knight show. You can call it the real news whatever. The point is it's David
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:46.240]  Knight and doing a great job with all the stuff he breaks down and all of these broadcasts on radio
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:55.200]  and TV simulcast are tomorrow's news today on so many fronts because we're not just buying the
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:02.720]  official story. We know the long term narrative of where we've come from, where we are and where
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:09.520]  we're going and what the globalists actually say in their industry publications, in their conferences
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:17.120]  and in their white papers that is academic and corporate but not secret. I mean we had Ted Malicon
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:23.040]  who used to be the main board member of the Davos group from its beginning until he left it saying
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:29.920]  it's dead and it's a joke and it's anti-American and it's authoritarian. That guy's the Aspen
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:34.240]  Institute, Council on Foreign Relations, he knows them all. The world leaders you name it.
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:40.640]  And now for a decade he's been quietly dynamining things on the inside and
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:47.040]  he's working with Nigel Farage and UKIP and all the rest of it. This is a real resistance
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:52.000]  but we're going to be attacked back. Okay right now
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:49:00.320]  I should go ahead and go to some of your phone calls here. Who is up first? We got Fred and Joe
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:09.200]  and Dan and Nate and Colt and Christian and Aaron and Mike and Dr. Colette and just so many others.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:16.000]  Who's been holding the longest? Let's go to Fred in Wisconsin here on the air Fred.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:22.720]  Hey Alex you know I said to your call screener a little bit. I don't want to talk about North
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:28.080]  Korea. I'm calling in because I disagree with you. I disagree with you entirely on that neutrality.
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:33.040]  I want to know if you have the cahones to debate me. I've been on your show before. I'm the SOPA
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.560]  TIPA protester back in the Go Daddy days and I don't know why you're on the wrong side of this
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:43.440]  Alex. Okay well let me let you stop right there. We don't screen your calls but we do ask what your
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:50.800]  topic is and it says North Korea missile launch and I don't mind you bringing up something else
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:58.880]  like like net neutrality but the net neutrality of Obama signaled the FCC taking control of free
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:04.080]  speech. The Federal Trade Commission and others calling for my arrest saying ban conservative
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:09.280]  and libertarian news and ban the drudge report including info wars and they had hearings admitting
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.680]  they're trying to do it and Google Facebook and Twitter are all massively censoring right now
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:19.600]  and Ajee Pye the new head of the FCC said you people are censoring under the name net neutrality
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:24.400]  bringing government power in to control free speech this is bull we're going back to the net
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.640]  neutrality we had previously and I've read all the different proposals it doesn't mean there
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:33.600]  aren't lobbyists on all sides with big telecoms trying to get a leg up on Google Facebook and
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:38.960]  Twitter who've been given a monopoly over the internet now Facebook Twitter and Google
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:46.160]  are trying to keep the big telecoms like AT&T and Time Warner out of that so I'm not lionizing any
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:51.200]  of the groups I've actually studied all the angles and so what Obama called net neutrality
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:55.360]  it is not net neutrality and has been absolutely anti-free speech
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.440]  okay I'm gonna let you go I appreciate your call Fred I'm gonna play these games
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:06.000]  these semantical games where you don't ever respond to me you talk about I don't have the nerve to
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.480]  talk to you and then you sit there and act like you don't hear me not gonna play third great games
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:19.120]  bro got it I'm gonna read what Ajipa breaks down here I've experienced soviet level censorship
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:25.040]  I can play the congressional hearings we're being censored we're being blacked out
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:28.800]  we're being banned and they're calling for our arrest in fact we pull that video up
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:36.560]  they're all over the news the MSNBC piece that I wanted last segment I played it three or four
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:42.880]  times in the last few days this is all over the place this is happening you didn't have all this
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:48.000]  web censorship under George W. Bush I didn't like George W. Bush but this wasn't going on
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.680]  it's been going on under Obama and the Democrats and it's out of control
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:52:00.560]  Nate and Sarasota Florida go ahead hey Alex I'm a long-time listener and use your products I love
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.560]  them I just want to give a shout out to my dad who's also a long-time listener Scott in Illinois

[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:38.880]  respond to you they just play their narcissistic twit games to feel powerful calling it this show
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:43.280]  I've experienced the massive censorship all on these other headpiece that's all I need
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:50.480]  anyways let's go ahead and play this clip uh of uh MSNBC and there's a whole bunch of these
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:56.640]  clips this is just this week though calling uh for uh Republicans to be arrested after the
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:03.840]  democrats overthrow the republic what has the republican party in the last 10 years done to
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:09.760]  help the american people what have they done this is not a political party this is a domestic
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:13.600]  terror group and what I think the american people should consider when they ask themselves
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:18.640]  that question where they party that has done nothing to help the american people is to vote
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:24.720]  them out and consider possibly afterwards locking them up joy and it looks like in this entire
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:28.960]  building we got one earpiece so I'm doing the rest of the show without calls without anything else
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:32.480]  hey but at least ladies and gentlemen it's a real broadcast you can believe there's no damn
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:37.680]  teleprompters in here we're just going up against the globalist toe-to-toe okay I'm gonna go back to
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:41.040]  Nate who I didn't hear what he had to say the one problem these headsets I think I'm gonna get a
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:44.160]  different brand of them I think I've asked them a few times but I'm not mad about it I like what
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:49.520]  the studios have is where it actually is a power pack right here in the chair and then you plug into
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:54.480]  that with a big cord and then it doesn't have a piece that pops out in the back because it happens
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:54:00.000]  every week all right here let's go let's go back to the callers anyways I've just been in
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  fight and mood lately ladies and gentlemen Nate repeat what you said I apologize that I lost audio
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:13.360]  hey Alice you got me I got you good baby you're right on yeah audio engineer
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.760]  so yeah I'm just calling in from sunny Sarasota Florida a longtime listener and use your products
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:23.840]  to love them just want to shout out to my dad a longtime listener in Decatur Illinois
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:31.680]  his name is Scott and I just wanted to comment on North Korea please so I actually lived on the
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:38.560]  border of North and South Korea for one year in an English camp they call English Village
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:42.800]  the theme park set up by the South Korean government to teach the kids of South Korea
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:48.000]  how to speak English and interact with foreigners the that's interesting enough being that it was
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:57.200]  right on the DMZ in a place called Paju South Korea but to top it off there's a giant Hollywood sign
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:04.160]  that says English Village with gun turrets behind it facing North Korea so at the time you know I
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.280]  was a young college student just getting my first job out of out of after graduating with my
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:15.440]  bachelors and I started to realize all these things that maybe we were part of the propaganda of
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:20.960]  the South as well at the time oh of course there's propaganda of the South you get that guy shot
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.120]  five times trying to come across last week and then he got all those worms and he's some of them
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:30.160]  you know a foot long and it's just I mean it's true I mean the South's not perfect and but I mean
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:37.120]  look at how they produce was it 400 and something times more goods than North Korea it's our 40,000
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:42.160]  it's some ridiculous number it's the most productive country in the world how can it be so productive
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:47.360]  and the north isn't I mean what do you think about the whole situation so so one thing I do
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:52.960]  want to say about the the the whole going to war and and any kind of war that would take place there
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:56:00.320]  is that you know everybody's focused on soul and proximity of soul to the DMZ which it is close
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:06.560]  but if you by living there I used to commute from the DMZ down to soul which took about an hour
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:12.960]  you're passing a population of you know between one and three million just within 10 to 20 miles
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:19.360]  of that border uh so that's one thing the other none of us want war I want North Korea to be free
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:26.000]  I want their people to you know be able to not be enslaved but the north is bad I know the South's
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.600]  not perfect I know the US isn't perfect but some of us get in this little romantic thing like any
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:37.040]  other country's good but America isn't North Korea in the communist regime super evil I mean they are
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:43.120]  super evil they're the biggest let me tell you what they're the most underestimated evil in the
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:48.560]  entire world and it's a humanitarian crisis that's been going on for entirely way too long I agree
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:54.320]  so what do we do what do we do I know I there's going to have to be some kind of covert operations
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:58.800]  going on uh going in now and I think that's the answer thing to have a coup against that guy just
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:03.440]  and just like East Germany merged with West Germany it'd be good for everybody including
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:07.920]  their own so-called elite give them all amnesty give them all ten million dollars a piece their
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:12.800]  inner party there's only a hundred of them or so uh and just let them leave and then just fix that

[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:18.320]  with disadvantaged children who've already been raped no one's going to believe them
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:21.840]  the medical exams aren't going to show that they've been raped by them because
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:27.600]  they've already been raped uh their bodies have already been torn open uh hollywood is a group
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:32.560]  of sadistic devil worshiping scum because you can't get in the club at the highest levels
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:39.120]  unless you're part of that uh it's it's it's incredible but go ahead eric hi hi alec can you
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:44.000]  hear me okay i can thank you for calling awesome thank you first off god bless you and your team
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.400]  for everything you do god bless the team for putting up with me because it's this isn't an
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:54.880]  act in here i'm bouncing off the wall some days that's okay thank you're taney um you know this
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:59.680]  hollywood thing it's really gotten to me because you know i come from a generation that just
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:07.040]  loved the movies we i i love them so much um it's what made me want to become an artist actually
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:14.800]  and now you see all this stuff happening and you it's like you can't even watch movies or tv anymore
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:20.320]  you know why that is evil wants to superimpose itself in front of art to control culture and
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:24.960]  then to dominate everybody so yeah there's a lot of beautiful art incredible people in hollywood
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:30.240]  they're being fed on by the vampires the vampire goes where the freshest best meat is so i mean i
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:35.920]  wouldn't be disenfranchised or disillusioned by that well i just think it's harder to i mean i'm
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:41.840]  starting to find a bunch of artists myself who are more conservative and have become conservative
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:47.520]  over the course of the last two years uh and trying to fight back against this to bring back some of
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:53.280]  the values that you know i've had i've had top producers i mean when i say top producers i mean
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:57.360]  people as big as ron howard not ron howard but you know as big as somebody like that come here to
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:00.880]  the office meet with me want to do projects but i'm like well what do you want to do and they're
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:05.040]  all closeted libertarian it's not really conservatives you know kurt russell spoke out
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:09.280]  there i mean there's not that many bruce willis is a patriot but when it comes to producers
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:12.560]  there's a lot of them they're just americana they're not out to get the country they're not
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:17.440]  pedophiles uh and you know that and they say what are we gonna do and i'm just like you know come out
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:21.280]  to la or come out to houston and meet with some of the guys and let's make a production with you
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:26.800]  and i'm like these are guys that have had like shows with 200 million dollar budgets on hbo okay and
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:31.680]  you know stuff like that and it's just the end of the day i i just i just can't interface with it
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:36.720]  because hollywood's never gonna let anything good come out of it in my view that's overtly
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:42.320]  pro-human does that make sense absolutely so what do you think we can do like especially for the
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:48.800]  artists that i'm finding like because i i make children's books now that's kind of my um and
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:54.800]  i saw that report you did on that uh nasty little what was it a disney book my baby feminist baby
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:04:00.720]  yeah it's a sexualizing newborn babies right and it's just par for the course and it's just like
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:06.640]  how can you it becomes harder as a self publisher especially to get your work out there when you're
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:12.400]  dealing with so much negativity and evil and nastiness and as you put it the vampires of
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:17.600]  hollywood um to get this information out well i think i mean i think we have to vote with our
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:22.160]  dollars you've already got some of the top grossing films now are christian and and from that it can
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:26.480]  just grow saying hey we're independent you'll have a label hey we're anti hollywood hey we're
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:30.880]  outside the system and if people just do that it's going to change the world god bless you eric

[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:48.160]  before i go back to your calls the incredible developments of the quickening as things just
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:54.800]  accelerate and get more insane by the moment as we predicted they're flushing the hollywood the
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:07:01.600]  prostitute core the matt louis the charlie roses all of them are being deposited down to the toilet
[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:07.760]  of history because they're worthless they're fake celebrities they failed brian williams all of them
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:12.960]  and they just use the fake news they get caught in or the sexual harassment that gets alleged
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:18.480]  to get rid of them because the system and the big owners they don't want to pay
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:22.960]  for all the losers that we're supposed to take over the culture and dominate
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:29.040]  that now everyone associates with the establishment so a new row of shark teeth because we've defanged
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:36.880]  this this row a new row is rotating forward and you're going to see lots of new little faces i predict
[02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:44.880]  like patriotoid kind of fake christian but people that attack trump in the liberty movement
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:48.960]  and and that cause in fighting that's going to be the next row of teeth now that those have been
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:56.800]  assanguated the last row of teeth have been sucked out of their rotting jaws but trump just i mean
[02:07:56.800 --> 02:08:00.960]  i'm not into power i'm not into cult of personality i'm not into presidents could
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:04.400]  stand obama could stand george bush could can't stand any of these people
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:10.800]  so reagan i studied his history liked him as a guy he wasn't a bad guy but you know he he he kind
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:15.280]  of got stymied early on and never really you know did a lot of what he wanted we got 3.3
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:19.520]  percent growth rate right now they said it never hit 3 percent we've got 70 percent reduction
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:22.880]  illegals coming across we've got him battling for tax cuts we've got hundreds of billions
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:28.640]  in new jobs 1.6 million new jobs we've got the stock market all-time highs we've got globalist
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:33.760]  hating him we've got trump making real deals the middle east and decapitating al-qaeda and
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:39.360]  isis and rolling up the muslim brotherhood clinton connected globalist connected arm of islam
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:45.200]  you've got trump saying investigate the head of nbc for going after folks as we know
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:49.920]  this is executives trying to burn their low-level folks as a way to try to appease the public
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:56.480]  investigate scarborough over death of intern that's the president with this type of bare knuckles
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:01.360]  attack because they've really gone after him they've tried to destroy him uh the first six
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:06.640]  months or so he tried to work with him it's over folks gloves are off now gloves are off
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:11.440]  and you're seeing a real president is he perfect no but he's not out to get the country he's
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:18.480]  incredibly dynamic he has such courage and i just want to say people that aren't thankful in life
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:22.400]  i found that's the number one ingredient of evil number one is joseph ferro we just got online
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:27.840]  the near calls the bottom of the hour so stay there callers i've learned in my life the number
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:34.000]  one thing of decadence and losers is they're not thankful and the thing that really leads to all
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.640]  sorts of mental illness and you name it is not being thankful my dad taught me this more than
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:42.800]  anybody but i'm telling you right now i'm so thankful for god i am so thankful for donald trump
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:46.640]  i'm so thankful for you i'm so thankful for joseph ferro and matt drudge because let me tell you
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:50.960]  it's scary when there's only 10 or 15 people that are actually on the front line now it's more
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:54.480]  i don't see all these groups as competition they try to stir up fights with me and bright bart i'm
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:58.400]  not doing it syrup fights world net daily i'm not doing it syrup fights i'm not doing it because
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:02.400]  let me tell you something this is a real war when you've had the stuff happen behind the scenes
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:07.840]  that's happened to joseph ferro myself and others it's a it's a fraternity it's a club and and let
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:12.240]  me tell you we're not sitting up here like oh we're special we we want you to make us not special
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:15.920]  we want to be obsolete i don't think i can speak for joseph ferro but he's been a journalist for
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.480]  50 years and fighting the globalist one of the first people to ever do it and the western journalism
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:26.000]  center but i i just know at my age and and joseph ferro let me ask you this question let me guess
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.160]  i bet you're kind of getting excited to see a lot of new folks coming on board you're still going
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.520]  to be there and you're still going to fight because you realize the fight's greater now than ever but
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:40.720]  looking a few you know years down the line bigger waves of liberty coming i almost can feel the
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:45.040]  beginnings of understanding that we're going to be eclipsed probably sooner rather than later and
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:50.160]  that as masters and i'm not saying that the power way but as true masters of a fight in the global
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:54.880]  it's not that we're that good but we are at the master level where the best there is that that
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:11:00.400]  we can see people coming up that are going to surpass us is that not the greatest satisfaction
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:05.920]  in your life or close to it absolutely especially when you get to my age alex you know i'm i'm older
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:11.120]  than you are you're you're just a kid by comparison but you know you want to make me older though
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:15.840]  because you said i've been doing this for 50 years no okay you've been a journalist for what 40 40
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:21.520]  something 40 years that's enough okay well by the way you look better than i do at your age so
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:26.080]  so you're you're i mean you're a champion you're absolutely right the most gratifying thing is to
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:32.720]  see you know you you do something like we did years and years ago and you see it having impact
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:39.360]  and you see others coming behind you and you say thank god we got reinforcements behind us
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:45.040]  we're not the only ones responsible for doing this anymore i welcome that competition i know you
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:50.000]  do alex because we're all a little bit different you know nobody none of us are doing the same thing
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:56.400]  when people ask me you know well who are your your competitors you know but i said bright part is it
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:03.600]  alex jones is a no the competition is cnn the new york times the fake news cartel
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:10.160]  alex jones and and bright part we love you guys you know thank you for being there we can't do it
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:14.640]  all it's like an armada battle and we've all got our ships on the same team the same navy
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:18.320]  battling the enemy we're not and i don't want young folks getting involved and not getting
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:22.400]  involved in fighting or think about who's the biggest or the best we're in a literal death
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:28.160]  battle the globalists have called it that this is a total war we need total commitment that's right
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:35.520]  we've been around for 20 years as you know more than 20 going on 21 now we face existential threats
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:42.480]  in every single one of those years okay and it's not just because you know it wasn't just from obama
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:48.160]  or from clinton you know what else it causes us existential threats is when people think
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:57.440]  everything's going to sleep right and you know frankly right now i'm i'm think things are going
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:01.760]  great and that's what i came on here to talk to you about it you know i'm really i'm excited
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:07.040]  about trump you know i think we gotta give him support because it means a lot to him so tell
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:11.680]  folks about this great initiative you've come up with well i'm gonna tell you about it but i first
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:18.400]  want to say this i think what we're seeing right now alex is we have not seen anything like this in
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:23.840]  our lifetimes would you agree with me on that i'm absolutely downfounded it's incredible i mean i was
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:31.440]  around for reagan in fact reagan was the thing that got the guy the personality who took me from the
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:39.680]  far left to being a constitutional you know limited government kind of guy okay that's what
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:47.040]  reagan did for me but what trump is doing in his first year the accomplishments are greater
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:52.960]  they're more stunning i'm just amazed at how much he's and that's why they're so scared
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:59.280]  he's taken us completely off defense he's on offense all the time and you talked about him
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:09.280]  you know tweeting about nbc and today is that unbelievable is there a connection
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:14.880]  i have no idea but let me tell you about what what you know i was thinking about this for months
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:20.960]  and i said how do we respond to this to this incredible precedent shattering thing where a
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:27.680]  president comes in and he's here to attack the deep state and he means it he actually means it
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:35.440]  you know he didn't just run on that to get elected he takes it seriously and so how do we go about
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:43.120]  out supporting that and it occurred to me that with all of the incredible opposition this guy
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:49.440]  faces you know what we can we can have a pity party alex joneson and farah about all the people
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:57.360]  who have attacked us and you know opposed us all along it's nothing compared to nothing and he just
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:04.560]  laughs it off he just tweets and he changes the dynamic of the debate you gotta love that so i'm
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:10.320]  thinking how do we what do we do how do we thank this guy how do we encourage that behavior to
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:17.440]  continue for the next seven years okay so i came up with this idea i don't know if it's anything
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:22.320]  great shakes or not but people are responding and i'm i'm excited about it it's called the thank
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:30.960]  trump campaign thank trump dot us and the idea is this we should be thanking this guy every day
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:35.600]  for what he is accomplishing right into exactly stay there tell us about it when we come back world

[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:11.920]  patriot libertarian americana media to promote basic americana that trump is now fully begun
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:16.560]  to reboot the country with and i know these are just postcards online you can send for free to
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:22.160]  the president and share to others but man that'd be a great hat magnificent all this stuff a great
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:26.000]  graphic stuff mr president thank you for your service you know i've seen president trump talk
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.200]  about the veterans and how great they are and they are but talk about how he's never done anything
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:33.360]  like they have and how they're the best this guy has people trying to kill him they're destroying
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:37.760]  his family they're trying to they're shutting down his businesses that thousands of lawsuits
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:43.600]  he's working around the clock he's delivering and he's i mean no but president trump is the commander
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:52.960]  in chief he is serving big time josephair absolutely alex you know i gotta tell you the thing i'm
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:58.160]  excited about this is you know we we worked with the white house to ensure that we had a path to
[02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:04.320]  get these messages to trump that's what people need to understand i mean i don't know if you know
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:10.480]  we're over 10 000 now did donald trump read 10 000 no but i i have a feeling maybe he has somebody
[02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:14.880]  who's keeping him up to date on this kind of stuff and maybe one of these days we can get him to
[02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:21.920]  tweet this and really explode this thing but i appreciate so much you taking the time that
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:28.720]  me talk about this because you know it's not all the independent news sites out there that we all
[02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:34.640]  i wish we all just got along and we all supported everybody supported each other's initiatives it
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:40.560]  would go a long way to you know bringing this together making us all more effective alex jones
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:47.040]  you recognize that and i appreciate you bringing this to the attention of of your best audience oh
[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:51.520]  absolutely but i mean it's bigger than that psychologically something happens when we're
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:58.880]  thankful and plus it's also everybody's sharing these memes with each other so we can think about
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:05.280]  all the president's done and and and and how good this is imagine if hillary was in right now so
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:12.160]  everybody needs to go to the site thank trump dot us and explain how they do this it's very easy
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:18.320]  we've linked it on info wars dot com and make this about the president i agreed because twitter
[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:22.800]  admits they want to ban him they blocked positive stuff getting to him at the top because they know
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:27.280]  he interfaces with the public people in person should print these off with color printers
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:32.400]  hand it to him when he's out on the road mail it into trump tower mail it into marlago that's
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:37.280]  where he actually gets his mail giving you some inside baseball folks this is norman rockwell
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:42.000]  stuff you've put together it's very beautiful does the fair of world net daily so again tell
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:48.640]  folks how they do this and why we're doing it well it's so easy just go to thank trump dot us it'll
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:53.440]  instantly thank you to this special page where you've got nine different cards we've added a few
[02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:58.240]  recently added three recently we'll probably add some more people get bored looking at the same
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:02.480]  cards over and over again there's a counter on there which shows which are the most popular
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:08.080]  there's a counter at the bottom this is how many people have participated so far and just over a
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:14.160]  week we've gotten 10 000 i know with alex jones's audience out there looking at this thing i can
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:21.200]  already see the counter moving right now so i appreciate that this is not a joseph ferris show
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:29.840]  it's not a wnd show this is really about the wonderful amazing once in a lifetime opportunity
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:36.400]  we have to change our country fundamentally because of the election in 2016 well i was about
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:40.080]  to say though i mean people are so
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:49.040]  instant gratification we better thank our lucky stars the supreme court we've got uh
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:54.320]  what's happened with the economy all of it i mean can you they plan to sew it all up when
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:59.200]  hillary got in the censorship the control they're still trying to go ahead with it and now his new
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.160]  head of the FCC is going after them for attacking our free speech and defending free speech i mean
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:13.200]  this is amazing i i i love it and what what hit me was watching these accomplishments almost every
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:19.760]  single day things that were so shocking you would you know we we got we got so despondent after all
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:25.680]  the the eight years of obama we didn't have victories like this in a whole year ever it's a total
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:31.760]  turning of the tide i mean i cannot believe how thankful i am i haven't been this thankful i'm even
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:38.000]  more thankful than i was then in the 80s when ronald reagan was around you know for me i thought we
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:43.360]  never see his likes again what we're seeing right now is even more exciting he's trump
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:50.720]  is a man of action he's a man of courage he cannot be deterred he doesn't care what people say about
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:56.720]  him but the fact that he doesn't care what his enemies say about him is one thing i think what
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:01.040]  we need to do he does care about us he does and they've got everything they can to cut him off from
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:07.760]  the people and that's why that's why i think trump dot us was invented well let me just say this i
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:12.960]  agree we should get this to him get it to you know all his emails his twitter everywhere uh paul watson
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:16.880]  should tweet at him you know drudge should hopefully but the bigger thing here is i think
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:21.840]  everybody should just share these memes period so we just all publicly thank the president on
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:26.080]  facebook twitter google our own emails everybody should just grab these i'm gonna tweet some of
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:31.200]  these images as well just as an understanding what we've accomplished what's already happened
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:37.280]  because again the liberty movement you your readers your listeners drudges everybody together
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:42.240]  this is all our shared victory and it shows what we can do when we finally get off the porch
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:48.560]  i'm glad you mentioned mr drudge who's one of my favorites love the guy but so far he's done on
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:54.800]  board now i know alex jones has a pipeline to matt drudge i know that for a fact matt drudge has
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:27:00.160]  even told me that so maybe you can shake things up with with matt i know but you know how matt is
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:04.960]  it's just someone contacting me constantly is is that i mean we need to get a news article out there
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:10.640]  about how you know thank president trump hashtag we should get a hashtag knowing hashtag uh thank
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:14.560]  trump think let's launch that hashtag everybody i don't know how twitter works properly i'm not an
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:19.520]  expert on it but just we'll do a hashtag uh thank trump and just everything he's done everybody should
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:24.720]  do articles and your own memes and and the answer is get everybody doing what world net daily and

[02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:28.400]  one of you joe and dan and colton christian and erin and mike and dr colette and everybody
[02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:38.080]  i'm gonna start going to him here in just a moment that said the globalists thought we were weak
[02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:45.120]  because we were asleep but just like they can poison insects with a with a pesticide and 95
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:50.080]  percent of them die because they didn't know what hit them the five percent that survive
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:56.480]  then reproduce and their pesticide resistant or pesticide immune there's some bugs you just
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:02.320]  dump the poison on they don't care they've mutated and so they've hit our past generations with
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:10.640]  high-tech brainwashing hollywood movies got them put into a trance but now that we're awakening
[02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:17.520]  from the trance the curve of people becoming resistant to the propaganda and immune to it
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:23.600]  skyrockets see once you get any resistance it's over that's why they said there's no world government
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:28.560]  there's no pedophile rings there's no devil worship there's no gmo there's none of this
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:33.120]  they just want to deny it like you're a kid have no debate about it because they can't win the debate
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:39.600]  because what they're doing is so bad and now you've got the head of the eu unelected heir of the
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:46.320]  nazi empire and the yunkers were the number two most powerful group in germany after hitler
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:52.800]  they own the biggest factories the yunker bombers all of it they took over european countries they
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:59.520]  still control today like luxembourg and when trump got in they said we will remove your president we
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:04.880]  will we'll destroy your economy we will defeat you i was reading this stuff in january of this year

[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:38.720]  or put them in a femacamp like they wanted us we're just going to promote so much prosperity
[02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:44.400]  and so much classical liberalism and everybody turns around and says how do we ever get enslaved

[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:49.680]  it makes me sick the fact that that inbred chicken neck cowardly fop could be in control of civilization

[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:38.960]  that's soros's controller right there that's the real bad guy right there that's the highest level

[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:47.360]  baton over to the next guest host go ahead erin thanks for holding you're a tripper
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:54.160]  hey how you doing alex buddy good brother hey look um so you know i tried to tell my friends
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:59.040]  real quick that uh before i get to my point that peep um was an idiot because anything
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:03.920]  that george soros is behind uh is not for the good of the people i just kind of wanted to
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:09.280]  yeah george soros calls obama's net neutrality good and calls it racist if we don't let him
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:18.800]  and the new i m f world bank u n e u consortium run the internet absolutely absolute crap this um
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:22.800]  the point i wanted to make about the the north korea thing and i could be totally off base here
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:28.000]  and i i completely understand that but something seemed very weird about that whole incident to
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:35.520]  me because um supposedly they shot the guy who escaped from across the dmz um and there was no
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:40.880]  fire back at all or there was no repercussions for breaking the treaty there so it just kind of
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:44.240]  makes well i've not been over there and i've not been in the military that i've studied it and that
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:48.720]  happens a lot of the time they grabbed the guy and drug him back uh i mean come up the defector
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:53.760]  last week that barely survived i shot five times what do you think uh how sometimes it makes you
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:58.880]  wonder what we see on tv how do we know this is not another golf of talking situation just to
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:05.520]  to you know get the people against north korea um well because that's the real dmz right there
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:09.440]  and i don't think the north koreans will go along with i think they've they've said it was real haven't
[02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:15.760]  they yeah i mean fair enough but then again they're under the control of the communist chinese so
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:20.160]  we don't know if there's any deception and play there or not you know i think that's fair
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:26.880]  you don't know it's true you don't know it's real um anything else and i wanted to make um
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:31.120]  um there was one other thing but i can't remember right now because i was just
[02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:36.960]  listening to you uh get pretty mad and i love it so uh well god bless you sir i appreciate you

[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:15.360]  and the fact that it's he's a dictator and that the bureaucracy that was just set up as a trade

[02:53:15.600 --> 02:53:21.200]  nasa and i dine deep cleanse all great product man thank you product uh what i'm gonna say about
[02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:27.360]  north korea is though you know they established this icbm uh pretty quickly and from what from
[02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:30.720]  the range that they were shooting before and i know trump said he's not playing any games
[02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:36.800]  i really believe him huge trump supporter but you know uh they really even though they can hit
[02:53:36.800 --> 02:53:41.040]  anywhere in the u.s. that they're saying now and i know nuclear warhead is a little bit heavier
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:46.720]  they can still hit that west coast so you know i hope they're not gonna wait too long
[02:53:46.720 --> 02:53:50.720]  and i don't want to see any war well let me just tell you don't don't worry about their missiles
[02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:54.800]  and their bases that can all be blowing up on the ground don't worry about russia and china
[02:53:54.800 --> 02:53:59.360]  if this happens that that everything is russia and china everything is that now they're gonna
[02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:03.680]  attack soul with a hundred thousand pieces of artillery if they're gonna get nuked and and
[02:54:03.680 --> 02:54:07.120]  madis after i've talked about this you don't as they've said we're gonna have to strike the whole
[02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:14.960]  dmz and just take them out so um i think they're manipulating north korea into a provocation and
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:19.920]  i i support trouble every other issue and i'm not saying i don't support him on this because
[02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:25.200]  he's got more information than i have but um north korea is in the crosshairs right now
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:30.640]  nuclear weapons are all aimed at them and they're gonna vaporize those people and uh you know is it
[02:54:30.640 --> 02:54:34.960]  good for generations to keep being used as cattle and enslaved or good if a third of them end up
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:42.320]  getting killed to end up getting the rest of them freed that's a pretty uh well i guess the word to
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:48.720]  use would be uh the the german philosopher nishi type equation but we're just gonna sit here while
[02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:52.960]  they keep threatening to attack japan or south korea everybody else and they got a gun point
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:57.040]  at saying we're gonna destroy america we're gonna attack first you're all dead we're gonna kill you
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:01.120]  how long we said we're taking and i'm not looking for a nuclear war they could trigger a bigger one
[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:05.520]  i want this to deescalate i want i mean north korea could come in out of the dark they could work
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:10.080]  with the west they could get everything fixed they don't want that they got a little fat demon guy
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:14.800]  that actually thinks he's god waddling around in charge of everything that'd be okay if he was a
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:21.760]  mcdonald's manager but he's not i'm saying how long is you know trump in well the u.s as a whole
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:26.560]  gonna take this of him just shooting his missiles eventually he's gonna he's gonna want to shoot
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:30.640]  somewhere on land whether it be japan hawaii the west coast but don't you think he's manly isn't
[02:55:30.640 --> 02:55:35.680]  he handsome i mean he just looks like a st imagine he could take on brock lessner i mean he's powerful
[02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:40.560]  he kind of looks like a three-year-old just put him in diapers you know he looks like a giant
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:47.520]  demonic vampire a little toddler vampire he really does and it's terrible somebody like that can
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:54.400]  actually run a country you know only with communism i mean that couldn't i mean kim jong-un couldn't be
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:56:00.000]  a toilet attendant kim jong-un couldn't tie his own shoelaces but he's the third generation dictator
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:04.160]  in the open communist wonderland it's always a dictatorship it's always some hereditary deal
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:08.400]  because communism's so cool and all these spoiled rotten brats go to university want to live under
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:12.480]  communism i think they all had to load their antifa butts up and go to north korea right now
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:17.840]  and get some forced labor camp stuff and eat some human flesh and eat some upper party feces
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:21.520]  that's what the lower level people eat the feces of the upper party and i just think the liberal
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:26.160]  should all go to north korea just learn to live in slave camps and just eat crap wouldn't they like
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:31.440]  that absolutely because you know they've been living like this for what three generations and no one
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:34.800]  there there's never been a protest or anything because they're they're afraid they're they're so
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:40.480]  brainwashed so i don't drop out a set up a deal where people that want to extradite themselves
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:45.520]  and you know wave their citizenship that we can have an express paid for first class tickets in
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:50.240]  north korea but you're not allowed to come back i'm serious i would offer all the leftist all the
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:56.400]  antifa an express ticket i will say as long as it's not a tourist visa that you're going to
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:01.280]  renounce your citizenship to move to north korea that i'm i'm willing as a as exploratory to pay
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:07.840]  for the first 10 people i think michael moran ago there as well see one person do it oh absolutely
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:13.440]  not they're gonna stay here as parasites feeding on us absolutely they just see kim jong-un as a
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:19.680]  fellow parasite the question is though like like or like little kim jong-il's like little ticks all
[02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:25.840]  over the belly of michael moran because there's a theory that kim jong-un actually his mother is
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:33.040]  michael moran and that and that he suckled michael moran that's that time my friend i'm joking thank

[03:00:31.200 --> 03:00:38.880]  let's go ahead talk to christian in houston texas thanks for holding i really appreciate
[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:50.800]  you doing that go ahead hi um i've been a um a fan for quite a long time um i wanted to talk
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:01:04.400]  about the vaccines yes ma'am um i believe i've been affected by it because um i have this thing
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:15.760]  called polycystic ovarian syndrome and did you take the Gardasil shot um yeah sadly my
[03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:24.880]  pair my grandparents made me do it so how old are you about 20 yeah the average
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:29.680]  trendy would ask how i know all that because i know the numbers i know the dates in the histories
[03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:35.200]  i know which vaccine out of over 300 does that i'm sorry that un project hit you up ma'am
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:41.280]  it's a hundred percent fact that it was a un eugenics program was tested in texas has been
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:48.400]  deployed against six latin american companies countries right now uh and is a what they call
[03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:54.400]  a soft sterilant and that it doesn't affect everyone uh depends on how the genetic mutagen
[03:01:54.400 --> 03:01:59.440]  has the effect according to the top scientists we've interviewed uh on the subject but absolutely
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:03.680]  you know why rick perry said it was the law to take it which it wasn't he just meant it was mandated
[03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:07.200]  so the state health department if that happens it kicks in the vaccine damage fund
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:14.640]  and federally and at the un so that they could dump that weapon on the market uh and hit girls
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:22.880]  between ages 10 and 12 about eight nine years ago with the bio weapon and so that is a bio weapon
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:32.320]  you were hit with and i'm very sorry to hear that okay and also um i hope we don't go into like a
[03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:39.680]  hunger games or divergent type government well trump's trying to turn that around that mean
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:44.240]  he's not going to be a strong man uh in this emergency surgery but everything he's been
[03:02:44.240 --> 03:02:51.680]  targeting is nasty and bad that's its own pandora's box but uh yeah so somebody asked you did
[03:02:51.680 --> 03:02:56.160]  did you have a big fever an autoimmune response any convulsions or did it just happen once you
[03:02:56.160 --> 03:03:03.040]  went into puberty what what what uh because it's directly linked uh with ovarian cancers uh and uh
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:07.440]  and a bunch of other forms of sterilization uh can you tell them because you know they
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:14.560]  actually inject you with non attenuated virus well i noticed that i started growing like
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:28.720]  facial hair and stuff like that and um and i went to the doctor and they diagnosed me with it well
[03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:33.920]  well you know that's how i knew that's that that vaccine's directly linked to that in the trials
[03:03:34.720 --> 03:03:40.560]  yeah you know and the funny thing about it is i could show somebody an insert and they won't
[03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:45.680]  read it but if i can guess that kind of impresses people and i don't want to impress them for me
[03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:50.400]  i want them to read about Gardasil did you know that india and japan have banned Gardasil
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:04:00.720]  did you get red spots or any type of hives on your body after the vaccine um not that i can
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:08.080]  remember but well as sad as this is christian you know a lot of women or young girls have convulsions
[03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:12.880]  after being given it and quite a few die have you searched engine Gardasil deaths or Gardasil
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:24.640]  adverse reactions research the link between um polycystic ovarian syndrome yeah and it said um
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:33.440]  like some girls like experience like irregular cycles afterwards oh yeah it's a lot
[03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:38.320]  that's very special we're not sure exactly how it all works but it's something else
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:44.080]  by the way the vaccine inserts says it doesn't protect you from hpv so the argument is oh you
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:48.720]  do this because it'll protect you and of course it doesn't protect you i'm very sorry i hope you
[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:57.280]  hope you get better we'll we'll pray for you after years of research working with top developers
[03:04:57.280 --> 03:05:04.480]  here in the united states with the latest cutting-edge science we are rolling out three new digestive
[03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:11.760]  gut aids one of them is a powerful pro digestive enzyme carnivore for being able to break down
[03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:19.280]  uh meat other proteins better and then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture
[03:05:19.280 --> 03:05:26.160]  of the very best strains in floral life advanced restoration and we also have an every day extremely
[03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:34.400]  affordable floral life every day maintenance but all of these are the very cutting edge top of the line
[03:05:34.400 --> 03:05:42.000]  probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price that is my goal here is to bring
[03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:48.080]  you the very best at the lowest price when you purchase it and then for store.com you know you
[03:05:48.080 --> 03:05:58.160]  are also financing the attack on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:05:58.720 --> 03:06:07.280]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide i know you can see alex jones here's a surprise i know
[03:06:07.280 --> 03:06:16.160]  you can see me now here's a surprise we can see you too church i know that you have because there's
[03:06:16.160 --> 03:06:22.080]  magic in you look at the pedophile rings the rape rings the satanic rings are all coming out the
[03:06:22.080 --> 03:06:30.560]  globalism the europe ally of the radical islam the radical islamists notice how all that's coming
[03:06:30.560 --> 03:06:36.800]  out now well don't worry it'll be a day late a dollar short but just like they injected native
[03:06:36.800 --> 03:06:44.480]  americans and black people and poor whites with live syphilis for 45 years and they shot up peruvians
[03:06:44.480 --> 03:06:51.680]  and mexicans with it too and people in eastern europe you name it and and the radiation testing
[03:06:51.680 --> 03:06:56.160]  and all of it it's going to come out about the vaccines and what they've been adding to them
[03:06:56.960 --> 03:07:01.280]  they even hide it in plain view i remember about a year after the hpv vaccine they were in them news
[03:07:01.280 --> 03:07:07.440]  in medical reports going oh the year before we released it as a simulant of of h1n1 an
[03:07:07.440 --> 03:07:12.320]  attenuated virus in the vaccine but it wasn't attenuated in the term of radiating it and breaking
[03:07:12.320 --> 03:07:21.120]  the virus so that it could replicate its protein chain of rna we left it alive we just attenuated
[03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:25.600]  it so it wouldn't be more deadly and then scientists asked well how'd you do that oh we're not gonna
[03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:32.800]  that's proprietary so they actually introduced that flute so you have to understand they mean
[03:07:33.280 --> 03:07:40.720]  business business and anybody that trusts anything coming out of big pharma is insane
[03:07:43.760 --> 03:07:52.480]  the clintons back when they were governor co-governor they were the only state in the union
[03:07:52.480 --> 03:07:59.280]  that would allow prison blood to be sold out of the prisons and then they would have it certified
[03:07:59.280 --> 03:08:04.080]  as clean even though they knew every group of blood had HIV and hepatitis in it and it turned
[03:08:04.080 --> 03:08:08.000]  out bear pharmaceutical knew about it this is all public news but if you're a new lister it's not my
[03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:12.960]  opinion this old minute and they had factor eight and all the rest of it and they shipped it out and
[03:08:12.960 --> 03:08:21.280]  then they had the corporate minutes in australia and france of the bear executives saying so what
[03:08:21.280 --> 03:08:28.720]  ship it out hemophiliacs are a burden kill them so you just remember that remember that they'll
[03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:36.160]  sit around those executives makes it feel real big like sure all the blood's contaminated you think
[03:08:36.160 --> 03:08:45.360]  i didn't know that too many hemophiliacs oh but if somebody was to go to those executives houses
[03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:50.080]  which i'm not calling for and line them up and chop them up with the sheddies oh it'd be all over
[03:08:50.080 --> 03:08:55.520]  the news the poor sweet little executive got chopped up with a machete because see they're a human
[03:08:55.520 --> 03:09:01.840]  we're just animals the bank executives why they've got rights they they're somebody but you
[03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:09.840]  you're gonna take the vaccine you're gonna die you're gonna be diseased and you're not a person
[03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:15.760]  all right we're gonna go to roger stone right now he's got laura lumar coming up in the next
[03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:21.120]  segment i got a bunch of callers i said i'd get to but i just we got dan and colton mike and we
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:24.240]  should get their numbers i should call them tomorrow and have them back on a special guest
[03:09:24.240 --> 03:09:28.720]  so i don't want to promise to go to calls and not get to them all but roger you've got a full plate
[03:09:28.720 --> 03:09:34.480]  but i gotta tell you 3.3 growth rates something never said what happened they said it's impossible
[03:09:34.480 --> 03:09:40.320]  to go three percent trump says investigate scar bro over death of intern that's in full wars.com
[03:09:40.320 --> 03:09:44.880]  exclusive uh the head of the uu says yeah we're gonna flood you with muslims europeans are bad
[03:09:44.880 --> 03:09:49.040]  he's quoted he's a nazi he's just totally bizarre i guess nazis like to exterminate groups of people
[03:09:49.840 --> 03:09:54.240]  we've just got all this matt laura collapsing the whole power structure getting rid of all these
[03:09:54.240 --> 03:09:58.880]  reporters that have failed using old sexual harassment cases they sat on trump says guard for
[03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:03.360]  the head of nbc that he's really the top target i agree where the executives get in trouble on
[03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:09.600]  mere allegations i'm not defending laura what a time to be alive my friend this is truly amazing
[03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:16.240]  what's the next shoe to drop roger stone well alex is interesting the mainstream media is
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:21.920]  literally going out of their minds over the fact that donald trump this morning tweeted a video
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:30.320]  a link to a video regarding islamic terrorists killing a dutch dutch man who was in crutches
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:38.560]  he also took a good solid shot at his nemesis uh joe scarborough there'll be more on the joe
[03:10:38.560 --> 03:10:44.640]  scarborough story coming out and we'll bring it to you here first at info wars but it is
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:51.520]  interesting to me alex that the president uh acts very trumpian after a refreshing weekend
[03:10:51.520 --> 03:10:58.480]  in palm beach uh as you know we reported here at info wars that general john kelly according to
[03:10:58.480 --> 03:11:06.800]  vanity fair had a tight plan to block access to the president during his uh rest period in palm
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:13.200]  beach and the president wouldn't be able to go to the main dining room well my sources tell me he
[03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:20.240]  was holding court in the main dining room talking to friends old and new and when it came when he
[03:11:20.240 --> 03:11:30.000]  came back to the job he was on the attack through his twitter feed the entire media is now scratching
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:37.280]  their heads as to why the president is being trumped they asked me what's his strategy what
[03:11:37.280 --> 03:11:44.000]  macabrellian play is this no macabrellian play down trump's the real thing he's the genuine
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:50.080]  article he uh had no problem taking a shot at joe scarborough because scarborough's taken
[03:11:50.080 --> 03:11:58.000]  numerous shots at him this is the down from that we elected he is exalting over the firing of
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:05.200]  matt lauer and he is on offense that's right matt lauer going along with the made up ppk
[03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:09.840]  going along with the made up uh you know edited tape about grabbing by the whatever meanwhile
[03:12:09.840 --> 03:12:14.560]  trump retweets video of a ledge attacks on muslims fox news even acts like it's a ledge
[03:12:14.560 --> 03:12:20.080]  these are documented real known cases again throwing gays off buildings you name it
[03:12:20.080 --> 03:12:25.440]  they have totally jumped the shark and that they're demonizing him for the big taboo
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:29.120]  because all the murders all the bombings all the shootings all the attacks they never say
[03:12:29.120 --> 03:12:34.640]  it's islamic he has broken the carton rule to talk about our lord and saviors the islamicist
[03:12:36.080 --> 03:12:41.840]  well and uh alex i had calls today from uh working reporters at the washington post at
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:48.240]  political they all want to know well where did the president get these links the links are online
[03:12:48.240 --> 03:12:53.440]  the president's capable of having someone go online and find it for him if he's heard about it or
[03:12:53.440 --> 03:13:00.800]  find it himself uh and uh it is interesting to me the way he continues to confound his critics now
[03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:08.800]  the new york pardon me the new york times has reported uh that he is bringing the nbc billy
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:16.320]  bush tape into question at least it's authenticity uh and that privately he has continued to express
[03:13:16.320 --> 03:13:23.680]  some concerns about the president's birth certificate i have not heard him say either one
[03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:31.920]  i don't know anyone that he has said either one two but i do know the reporters in in question and
[03:13:31.920 --> 03:13:40.080]  i believe that they do have some solid sources for those uh in the race in the in the base
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:46.880]  he shows that dylan trump is still dylan trump we're getting laura limmer on the line right now
[03:13:46.880 --> 03:13:52.800]  she's got her confrontation with laura with the sorcerer coming up but the fact that these are
[03:13:52.800 --> 03:13:57.120]  all known video clips that have already been confirmed throwing the gays off the buildings
[03:13:57.120 --> 03:14:02.880]  beating the dutch man to death uh doing all this to imply that islam uh you know when they go to
[03:14:02.880 --> 03:14:07.840]  the bathroom flowers come out i mean the media acting like oh trump's done it now that shows
[03:14:07.840 --> 03:14:12.640]  this is what he should be doing every day whatever they say don't do whatever they say is this
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:17.680]  crediting it's the opposite whatever they say is you do the opposite well then we've had a
[03:14:17.680 --> 03:14:23.200]  siege change that was unthinkable under maroc obama maroc obama and hillary clinton wouldn't
[03:14:23.200 --> 03:14:30.160]  admit that islamic terrorism even existed it's a new day there's a new sheriff in town in the
[03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:36.320]  videos that the president sent are consistent with his policies i'm destroying ices that's right

[03:20:36.880 --> 03:20:45.840]  is scrappy gorilla conservative journalist laura lumar who has extraordinary breaking news about
[03:20:45.840 --> 03:20:55.200]  recent irregularities in washington when it comes to the use of the presidential limousine
[03:20:55.200 --> 03:21:03.280]  laura lay it on us thanks for having me roger yes so i was teasing this story earlier last week
[03:21:03.280 --> 03:21:09.440]  with alex jones but um i was able to you know speak with the source who provided me with the
[03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:16.240]  information and their own firsthand encounter and they've agreed to do an exclusive interview so uh
[03:21:16.880 --> 03:21:24.640]  in 1999 uh this source who will be unnamed for now until they do their interview was working as a
[03:21:24.640 --> 03:21:31.360]  white house advanced staff member in california under bill clinton's presidency and bill clinton
[03:21:31.360 --> 03:21:37.520]  would come to los angeles california and he would stay at the century plaza hotel and while he was
[03:21:37.520 --> 03:21:44.720]  staying there on numerous occasions he would um hang out with uh hollywood political donors who
[03:21:44.720 --> 03:21:48.800]  were friends of his as we know bill clinton is friends with kevin spacey he's friends with harvey
[03:21:48.800 --> 03:21:56.240]  Weinstein and a lot of these other problematic uh male hollywood elitists who are now being accused
[03:21:56.240 --> 03:22:04.320]  of sexual harassment and rape and sexual assault and according to this staffer uh he was instructed
[03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:09.920]  by another white house official white house staffer under bill clinton to entertain kevin spacey
[03:22:10.560 --> 03:22:16.960]  so he used one of the presidential motorcades and this was i guess standard uh with bill clinton's
[03:22:16.960 --> 03:22:24.320]  presidency to entertain kevin spacey and took kevin spacey out for dinner to nightclubs with
[03:22:24.320 --> 03:22:28.800]  other individuals who were working with bill clinton sometimes bill clinton was present as well
[03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:37.200]  and uh according to the source um he engaged in a sexual act or had sex with kevin spacey
[03:22:37.200 --> 03:22:43.440]  in one of these official presidential motorcade cards and he's not claiming that spacey assaulted
[03:22:43.440 --> 03:22:49.680]  him or harassed him it was consensual but what he has an issue with and wanted to expose is this
[03:22:49.680 --> 03:22:55.280]  blatant abuse of political power and resources on the taxpayer dime right literally using
[03:22:55.280 --> 03:23:02.240]  presidential motorcades which we pay for as taxpayers to have sex right to to allow your
[03:23:02.240 --> 03:23:07.280]  friends who are now being accused of being pedophiles and having to apologize for touching
[03:23:07.280 --> 03:23:16.000]  underage boys um for for your own sexual perversions and and uh and delights and it gets worse and
[03:23:16.560 --> 03:23:21.680]  he he went on to say that sometimes the motorcade vehicles uh used to transport bill clinton with
[03:23:21.680 --> 03:23:29.120]  smell of alcohol and marijuana and um another individual who's also implicated in this is
[03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:34.720]  al gore who also ran for president al gore was present at some of these events that bill clinton
[03:23:34.720 --> 03:23:40.160]  would have at the century plaza hotel when he was in town in california and according to the
[03:23:40.160 --> 03:23:46.560]  staffer he was instructed to go on late night heineken runs for al gore so he would go out and
[03:23:46.560 --> 03:23:52.400]  buy six packs of heineken for al gore drop them off at his hotel room and then al gore would order
[03:23:53.040 --> 03:23:59.840]  masseuses to come to his room late at night and uh this was all documented by by the source of
[03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:05.440]  course who has photographs with bill clinton in front of air force one with al gore um
[03:24:05.440 --> 03:24:11.200]  photographic evidence proving that he in fact was an advanced employee and it's really interesting
[03:24:11.200 --> 03:24:17.360]  that this is all coming to light now because in 2006 al gore was actually accused an official
[03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:24.320]  complaint was filed against him for sexual abuse and um it was filed by a masseuse at a hotel who
[03:24:24.320 --> 03:24:31.680]  claimed that uh al gore ordered a masseuse to come to his room at a very expensive hotel uh very late
[03:24:31.680 --> 03:24:39.280]  at night and that uh the the session was three hours long and that's he's sexually abuser so
[03:24:39.280 --> 03:24:45.840]  to recap the stunning story your source and we went through this this morning you've got this cold
[03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:52.640]  said that the presidential motorcade was being used uh to pick up and transport prostitutes and
[03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:59.360]  other party favors for bill clinton uh as well as sending the presidential limousine out on a
[03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:07.040]  beer run for al gore and this is really incredible and gay hookup in the back of the presidential
[03:25:07.040 --> 03:25:16.400]  limousine for kevin spacey because he's an uh an f o uh b friend of bill uh extraordinary now i
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:22.800]  know you plan to roll this out with your source because we don't put anything on the air at

[03:25:43.680 --> 03:25:51.120]  signing of the books that neither one of them wrote at the strand bookstore uh on west broadway

[03:33:45.920 --> 03:33:52.720]  conversations with dr william thompson uh the federal official charge with vaccine safety
[03:33:52.720 --> 03:33:59.920]  kevin berry who is the head of first freedoms uh an activist uh active in the movement to question

[03:34:09.760 --> 03:34:17.120]  roger thanks for having me so kevin first of all uh tell us about your book and what it says
[03:34:17.120 --> 03:34:22.880]  and tell us about the stunning information that you have learned out of california a state which
[03:34:22.880 --> 03:34:29.200]  is now recently made it a requirement that children be vaccinated before they can attend the public
[03:34:29.200 --> 03:34:38.640]  schools right uh dr thompson was uh is a cdc vaccine safety researcher for for recorded calls
[03:34:38.640 --> 03:34:45.360]  were done by dr brian hooker who's an activist in california and the headline of what dr thompson
[03:34:45.360 --> 03:34:51.440]  is saying is that vaccine safety is an open question and he's in a position to know because
[03:34:51.440 --> 03:34:58.000]  he's a named author on studies of thimeris all the mercury preservative in vaccines and on the
[03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:05.600]  m mr vaccine and he says that research that he was a named author on on the m mr was uh fraudulent
[03:35:05.600 --> 03:35:12.000]  and he says that he would never give his wife uh the mersal containing shot if she was pregnant
[03:35:12.560 --> 03:35:18.720]  so uh of the entire vaccine schedule which is allegedly safe the only two things they ever
[03:35:18.720 --> 03:35:25.680]  looked at they found problems with both so how about how that applies to california do
[03:35:25.680 --> 03:35:33.600]  you want me to go back to california yes please um well in 2015 california used uh they whipped up
[03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:40.640]  a frenzy about uh a few measles cases in disneyland none of which were transmitted in schools
[03:35:41.440 --> 03:35:49.120]  and they uh passed vaccine mandates covering the 39 million citizens of california one eighth
[03:35:49.120 --> 03:35:58.400]  of americans live in california so far they got a captive market so what and that bill was dropped
[03:35:58.400 --> 03:36:04.880]  in march 2015 the same week that that bill was dropped the cal pack the california
[03:36:06.800 --> 03:36:11.600]  medical associations political action committee donated a hundred thousand dollars a little over
[03:36:11.600 --> 03:36:16.640]  a hundred thousand dollars to the california democratic party and then that bill passed through
[03:36:17.200 --> 03:36:21.920]  all the california committees the house the senate and was signed by the democratic governor all
[03:36:21.920 --> 03:36:29.440]  those committees both houses were uh dominated by the democratic party and that that bill passed
[03:36:30.080 --> 03:36:37.280]  and 39 million californians are suffering the consequences it's extraordinary to me
[03:36:37.280 --> 03:36:44.240]  that the federal government has paid out over three and a half billion dollars to americans
[03:36:44.240 --> 03:36:52.080]  who were damaged or injured by mandatory vaccinations yet congressman adam schiff has
[03:36:52.080 --> 03:36:59.120]  sponsored essentially a sense of the house resolution uh which declares that the federal
[03:36:59.120 --> 03:37:06.880]  government has never spent a dime has never paid out a dime in damages done by vaccinations
[03:37:06.880 --> 03:37:13.680]  this is like sponsoring legislation that says for example the holocaust never happened uh
[03:37:13.680 --> 03:37:20.560]  we're gonna talk about this with uh michelle ford who is active with the vaccinate vaccination
[03:37:21.920 --> 03:37:30.320]  injury awareness league uh coming up but i commend your book kevin to anyone who questions
[03:37:30.320 --> 03:37:37.680]  this uh story of the unsafety of vaccinations tired of being called a conspiracy theorist
[03:37:37.680 --> 03:37:45.280]  and a crook when the science and the numbers show the enormous damage i by the way believe
[03:37:45.280 --> 03:37:51.040]  that there's probably nothing wrong with vaccinations it's what's in the vaccinations
[03:37:51.040 --> 03:37:58.880]  that seems to be causing problems and evidently changing that would cost big pharma millions and
[03:37:58.880 --> 03:38:08.080]  millions of dollars i'm extraordinarily disappointed uh in this narrow sense look i love the record
[03:38:08.080 --> 03:38:15.600]  stock market i love unemployment at an all-time low i love the record housing market i like the
[03:38:15.600 --> 03:38:21.520]  fact that the president seems determined to renegotiate the some of these bum trade agreements
[03:38:21.520 --> 03:38:27.360]  that are destroying our job market but where i am very disappointed was in the president's
[03:38:27.360 --> 03:38:34.560]  announcement when he was the president-elect that he would appoint a commission to investigate
[03:38:34.560 --> 03:38:41.360]  vaccination safety and that he would ask uh the activist and environmentalist robert f
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:48.240]  kennedy jr the senator of the late new york senator the son of the late new york senator
[03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:55.680]  to head such a commission kennedy is known as a man of integrity who's extremely well versed
[03:38:55.680 --> 03:39:03.840]  on this issue yet since that time the president has declared an opioid crisis and he's appointed
[03:39:03.840 --> 03:39:11.840]  a commission to pursue that which is a vital public health issue but so far we have no commission
[03:39:12.400 --> 03:39:18.960]  and i am told that mr kennedy here is nothing from the white house this is disappointing
[03:39:18.960 --> 03:39:26.400]  uh because the president uh is known to have his own personal concerns about the safety
[03:39:26.400 --> 03:39:34.080]  of vaccinations he expressed them numerous times in the campaign does the president know
[03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:44.480]  that his fda uh appointee to head the fda is a mandatory uh vaccination advocate uh it really
[03:39:44.480 --> 03:39:52.160]  is extraordinary that we're allowing the massive wealth transfer of billions of dollars in injuries
[03:39:52.160 --> 03:39:58.480]  to chronic lifetime medical issues while removing millions of future adults from ever working because
[03:39:59.040 --> 03:40:06.000]  of this mandatory vaccination policy vaccination safety requires rigorous science
[03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:14.320]  backed by true quality control we don't have that today none of it exists in the fda something
[03:40:14.320 --> 03:40:21.680]  that the president should understand as a builder and someone who is exacting in his standards
[03:40:21.680 --> 03:40:28.640]  so i asked again i call on the president please follow through on your pledge
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:36.000]  let's see where the science is you can appoint advocates of vaccinations to the commission
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:42.800]  if you wish mr kennedy would be an able choice to chair this panel and get to the bottom of
[03:40:42.800 --> 03:40:51.360]  this question as for this christmas i urge you to pick up a copy of kevin berry's terrific book
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:59.360]  vaccination or vaccine whistleblower this was the first book that i read on the topic and it very

[03:47:16.640 --> 03:47:29.040]  you are the resistance and now your host roger stone welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your
[03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:38.880]  host roger stone joining us now is michelle ford of the vaccination uh injury awareness league
[03:47:38.880 --> 03:47:48.000]  an activist and one of the most informed people i know on the issue of vaccination safety it was
[03:47:48.000 --> 03:47:55.600]  michelle ford who brought my attention to the idea that congressman adam schiff has sponsored
[03:47:55.600 --> 03:48:02.800]  essentially a resolution declaring that the federal government has never paid out even a far thing
[03:48:02.800 --> 03:48:10.320]  even a penny for injury of citizens by vaccinations michelle would you now correct the record for us
[03:48:11.600 --> 03:48:18.080]  thank you so much roger yes i'd love to correct the record um because you know essentially adam
[03:48:18.080 --> 03:48:24.800]  schiff is saying that there's no credible evidence whatsoever of vaccine injury yet the federal court
[03:48:24.800 --> 03:48:32.240]  of claims has paid out over three point seven billion dollars since the vaccine um national
[03:48:32.240 --> 03:48:41.600]  childhood vaccine injury act was passed in 1986 so uh it's ridiculous to try to make a claim that
[03:48:41.600 --> 03:48:48.480]  vaccine injuries don't exist when the government is regularly paying out vaccine injuries it's
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:56.480]  horrible so is that information exist how do we document that that has happened oh my goodness
[03:48:56.480 --> 03:49:04.000]  well my favorite place to find it um is the the mom street journal um lori gregory is a blogger
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:10.880]  and a mom and she has done incredible research on the federal court of claims and actually one
[03:49:10.880 --> 03:49:21.440]  year ago today november 29th 2016 she reported on a flu um vaccine injury payout uh increase of
[03:49:21.440 --> 03:49:30.400]  almost 400 percent and then shortly thereafter when the 2016 report came out she issued another
[03:49:30.400 --> 03:49:38.640]  blog post indicating that the flu vaccine injury had increased by an additional 1188 percent over
[03:49:38.640 --> 03:49:44.000]  prior year so i love to go to the mom street journal dot com because she's got all of the
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:51.600]  embedded links and you can quickly and easily locate the federal court of claims report that
[03:49:51.600 --> 03:49:55.920]  will bring you right to the federal court of claims because if you try to google it you're
[03:49:55.920 --> 03:50:00.960]  going to be on a little bit of a rabbit rabbit hole which i'm looking for that thing but it's
[03:50:00.960 --> 03:50:07.040]  right there embedded on her articles well i'm very familiar with the terrific work of lori
[03:50:07.040 --> 03:50:13.040]  gregory we're going to get her on here and if the worst to continue our dialogue on this important
[03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:19.120]  issue as i recall there's a actually a website doesn't have much of a search engine that is
[03:50:19.840 --> 03:50:27.360]  posted by the government that details these incredible payouts uh so it's hard to fathom
[03:50:27.360 --> 03:50:35.760]  how a member of congress can deny reality it's like saying the sky isn't blue or rain isn't wet
[03:50:35.760 --> 03:50:45.040]  it is an undisputed fact i don't know if mr schiff is seeking contributions from big pharma
[03:50:45.040 --> 03:50:53.680]  or why he would promulgate a lie an extraordinary lie uh you brought my attention to the website
[03:50:53.680 --> 03:50:59.600]  tell us a little bit about that which website are you talking about the federal court of claims
[03:50:59.600 --> 03:51:08.000]  website yes the uh let me give you the exact name uh from some of your uh extraordinary
[03:51:08.000 --> 03:51:17.200]  research but uh this is um a the national let's say here it is uh the um the hmo's uh under the
[03:51:17.200 --> 03:51:24.640]  cdc oh collected this information uh kaiser and others and so address that if you would
[03:51:24.640 --> 03:51:32.240]  okay so there's something called the vaccine safety data link and it was in partnership
[03:51:32.240 --> 03:51:38.320]  with the cdc it was formed in the early 1990s after the national childhood vaccine injury act
[03:51:38.320 --> 03:51:45.600]  went into effect and essentially roger it's a warehouse a warehouse of data that independent
[03:51:45.600 --> 03:51:52.960]  researchers do not have easy access to in fact i only know of two independent science researchers
[03:51:52.960 --> 03:51:59.200]  who had access to it and they were not allowed to photograph the details take photocopies remove
[03:51:59.200 --> 03:52:07.040]  any of the data from their visit essentially they were only able to take notes um but there are
[03:52:07.040 --> 03:52:15.760]  several medical insurance hmo's that participate in warehousing this vaccine data and if they would
[03:52:15.760 --> 03:52:23.440]  just allow independent researchers to have access to that data that you know the public would be able
[03:52:23.440 --> 03:52:29.360]  to scrutinize the data that's in there and have a look at what's really going on but the data is
[03:52:29.360 --> 03:52:35.600]  being kept private from the public i believe that there's about a 10 million dollar annual budget to
[03:52:35.600 --> 03:52:43.520]  keep it locked up um through the america's health insurance plans the a hip and because it's a private
[03:52:43.520 --> 03:52:49.440]  entity the a hip that information cannot be requested through the freedom of information act
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:57.840]  so we've got kaiser permanente of washington um the northwest northern california southern california
[03:52:57.840 --> 03:53:06.080]  colorado we also have health partners in minnesota marshfield clinic in wisconsin um harvard pilgrim
[03:53:06.080 --> 03:53:13.120]  in main and all of these hmo's partner with the cdc to keep that public the information away from
[03:53:13.120 --> 03:53:20.000]  the public so it's it's horrible that we don't have access to that data yeah you've got almost
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:26.560]  two decades of information that the american people should be entitled to and it documents
[03:53:26.560 --> 03:53:34.400]  the very payouts that we're talking about the payouts that adam schiff insists never really
[03:53:34.400 --> 03:53:44.160]  happened uh what is your view now of the president's uh seeming inaction on his pledge to appoint
[03:53:44.160 --> 03:53:53.520]  a uh commission to study uh vaccination safety i know that you like me was were very uh pleased
[03:53:53.520 --> 03:53:59.680]  by the president's indication that robert kennedy jr the son of the former new york
[03:53:59.680 --> 03:54:07.120]  us senator would head such a commission under the trump administration but as i understand it
[03:54:07.120 --> 03:54:13.440]  despite that early offer by the president or i should say promise mr kennedy has heard nothing
[03:54:13.440 --> 03:54:20.800]  how do you think we can get this back on track i think that you know trump is a businessman
[03:54:20.800 --> 03:54:26.720]  and trump needs to be able to have access to this these numbers is he aware that there's
[03:54:26.720 --> 03:54:32.800]  been 3.7 billion dollars paid out in vaccine injury is he aware that there's about 10 million
[03:54:32.800 --> 03:54:39.360]  dollars a year keeping information away from the american public is someone in congress keeping track
[03:54:39.360 --> 03:54:44.640]  of the increased number of children with disabilities is anyone keeping track of the
[03:54:44.640 --> 03:54:52.240]  exorbitant expenses involved with raising a child with autism you know we're essentially trading
[03:54:52.240 --> 03:55:02.000]  short-term illness a short-term disease um for chronic lifelong illness and it's crippling our
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:11.120]  country it will in the long term cripple our economy and um dr stefanie senef of mit she's
[03:55:11.120 --> 03:55:17.200]  an incredibly gifted mathematician and she's got so many letters after her name i don't even know
[03:55:17.200 --> 03:55:25.360]  all of them but she did the math and essentially figured out that by the year 2032 50 percent of
[03:55:25.360 --> 03:55:31.040]  all children are going to be diagnosed with autism and 80 percent of boys so what's that going to do
[03:55:31.040 --> 03:55:37.200]  to our country as an economy how are we going to be a viable force in this world um so i think that
[03:55:37.200 --> 03:55:42.000]  if someone can speak to trump about the numbers that may be the thing that's going to have him
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:48.000]  wake up to this reality um the other thing too roger if you don't mind that i take a moment
[03:55:48.720 --> 03:55:57.840]  i really urge the president to overturn executive order number 13139 which was the executive order
[03:55:57.840 --> 03:56:05.280]  under bill clinton which mandated um anthrax vaccines for all of our active duty military it
[03:56:05.280 --> 03:56:11.520]  is a forced situation these active duty military have no choice in the matter there have been
[03:56:11.520 --> 03:56:19.040]  court marshals and um this is horrible we're seeing um lots and lots of disability there's
[03:56:19.040 --> 03:56:26.000]  an incredible film called vaccine syndrome um by a filmmaker named scott miller who has
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:31.440]  spent the last 15 years detailing what's happening to our active duty military's health
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:37.840]  and frankly the health of their offspring by having had to be forced to take the anthrax vaccine so
[03:56:37.840 --> 03:56:46.720]  so it's not just a problem for children it's also a problem for adults we saw you know earlier this
[03:56:46.720 --> 03:56:57.200]  week um 50 nurses in minnesota were excused from their job by ascentia health um in again in minnesota
[03:56:57.200 --> 03:57:01.760]  for refusing to take the flu vaccine and some of these people some of these nurses
[03:57:02.320 --> 03:57:05.440]  didn't want to take the vaccine because they had suffered a vaccine reaction
[03:57:05.440 --> 03:57:11.600]  so vaccine reactions are very real um pretending that they don't exist would be like pretending
[03:57:11.600 --> 03:57:16.720]  that other drugs don't have reactions and we know that that's simply not the truth they do
[03:57:17.440 --> 03:57:25.200]  cause reactions all right thank you michelle for for joining us here on the film show

[03:58:07.520 --> 03:58:13.360]  self identify as native american until she was 38 years old she claimed that minority status for
[03:58:13.360 --> 03:58:18.240]  years in order to climb the academic ladder and this false information wasn't something she just
[03:58:18.240 --> 03:58:23.360]  claimed as a student but warren began putting it in her professional bios for years when law
[03:58:23.360 --> 03:58:29.280]  schools were hungry for minority faculty pocahontas lied about being native american in order to
[03:58:29.280 --> 03:58:34.960]  gain an unfair advantage in securing academic tenure this means she actually stole that position
[03:58:34.960 --> 03:58:41.200]  from a real native american who could have benefited from their minority status racist leon
