[00:00.000 --> 00:18.960]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:18.960 --> 00:28.640]  It is the seventh day of July, 2013, this is another live, worldwide transmission.
[00:28.640 --> 00:34.880]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be here for the next two hours as we are
[00:34.880 --> 00:42.680]  every single Sunday, six days a week, Monday through Friday, 11am to 2pm central, and then
[00:42.680 --> 00:49.680]  of course back Sundays, 4-6pm central, and we have infowars, nightly news, seven o'clock,
[00:49.680 --> 00:52.240]  each and every weeknight as well.
[00:52.240 --> 00:56.680]  Okay, where to start here?
[00:56.680 --> 01:04.280]  Things have gone from stable to completely melted down the last three years by globalist
[01:04.280 --> 01:10.080]  design in Egypt, and I want to go over the latest that's happened there.
[01:10.080 --> 01:14.800]  Our controlled dinosaur media keeps calling it a protest.
[01:14.800 --> 01:17.200]  Oh, there's some protesting.
[01:17.200 --> 01:27.080]  The Muslim Brotherhood is protesting the ouster of Mohammed Morrissey and the mean military
[01:27.080 --> 01:32.720]  has shot some of them, and I'm certainly not even taking sides here, but it is the Muslim
[01:32.720 --> 01:38.120]  Brotherhood in Al Qaeda that if you watch the actual videos pouring out of Egypt, some
[01:38.120 --> 01:40.680]  of them are up on infowars.com right now.
[01:40.680 --> 01:43.320]  It's guys with shaved heads and beards.
[01:43.320 --> 01:44.880]  That's not just Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:44.880 --> 01:54.040]  These Wahhabist Saudi Arabian backed Al Qaeda types are grabbing secularist, but also Shiites,
[01:54.040 --> 02:01.000]  Alawites, anybody that can get the Christians and throwing them off roofs, cutting their
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.920]  heads off and beating their brains out.
[02:03.920 --> 02:10.400]  Now warning, these videos are up on infowars.com.
[02:10.400 --> 02:16.720]  Warning when you go watch them, but look, I'm told I'm having all my rights taken because
[02:16.720 --> 02:23.920]  of Wahhabist Al Qaeda, and our government runs these people and won't even call them
[02:23.920 --> 02:24.920]  murderers.
[02:24.920 --> 02:31.720]  They call them protesters, and our criminal government is then criticizing the military
[02:31.720 --> 02:36.320]  of Egypt when they shoot these people, when they're trying, and in fact, I was watching
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.960]  CNN two nights ago, Friday night, and they're like, it's just terrible, the military just
[02:41.960 --> 02:48.760]  shot dozens of people killing several who were just protesting to actually go to the
[02:48.760 --> 02:53.800]  foreign press, German press, Egyptian press, you name it.
[02:53.800 --> 02:59.680]  And they're not even taking sides, they report tens of thousands were trying to storm the
[02:59.680 --> 03:08.400]  government facilities, and we're trying to burn the buildings down.
[03:08.400 --> 03:15.880]  But by the time you see it on our news, it's, oh, there's some sweet little protesters.
[03:15.880 --> 03:21.080]  That's what they said about them in Libya the last few years, engaging in mass murder,
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.440]  premeditatedly brought in by NATO and our criminal mafia run government.
[03:25.440 --> 03:31.040]  That's what they've been saying for two and a half years in Syria.
[03:31.040 --> 03:33.080]  Until a year ago, they called them protesters.
[03:33.080 --> 03:35.440]  So I'm going to be getting into all of that.
[03:35.440 --> 03:43.240]  Jim Mars, who is here in town, Jim Mars, who I ran into yesterday, is going to be in studio
[03:43.240 --> 03:49.840]  with us to cover the waterfront from the NSA scandals to the secret police scandals to
[03:49.840 --> 03:55.840]  a lot of free energy research of real technology like hydrogen that you can take right out
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.960]  of water that they've had for 50-plus years, well, longer than that, but proven for more
[04:00.960 --> 04:09.560]  than 50 years since the 60s, we're going to have a report from Mars, little pun there,
[04:09.560 --> 04:16.080]  with Jim for at least the second hour, maybe longer today.
[04:16.080 --> 04:21.240]  He's scheduled to get around 4.30, so as soon as he gets here, we'll bring him in to the
[04:21.240 --> 04:22.240]  studio.
[04:22.240 --> 04:24.400]  So that's coming up as well.
[04:24.400 --> 04:31.440]  Obviously, we've got the 777 crashing out in San Francisco, and the aftermath of that,
[04:31.440 --> 04:38.800]  Trayvon Martin, we're going to get into Snowden, says Western states in bed with the NSA.
[04:38.800 --> 04:42.880]  Wow, what incredible top secret information.
[04:42.880 --> 04:46.480]  Next he'll tell me Obama's a big liar, and so is Bill Clinton.
[04:46.480 --> 04:50.720]  I mean, next he'll tell me grass is green.
[04:50.720 --> 04:56.280]  What a horrible traitor, I mean, oh, our national security's so violated, he might expose the
[04:56.280 --> 04:59.760]  foreign banks that hijacked the country, oh, it's horrible.
[04:59.760 --> 05:03.600]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives.
[05:03.600 --> 05:06.200]  Nature regularly sends us destructive storms.
[05:06.200 --> 05:09.240]  24 hours before a storm strikes, people panic.
[05:09.240 --> 05:12.720]  It would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve.
[05:12.720 --> 05:17.880]  The food price storm from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights
[05:17.880 --> 05:19.440]  by the end of the summer.
[05:19.440 --> 05:21.320]  Wonder if there'll really be a problem?
[05:21.320 --> 05:26.200]  E-Foods Direct has a plan to maximize your food dollar and guarantee you'll be glad you
[05:26.200 --> 05:27.200]  ordered food.

[05:58.800 --> 06:04.800]  We've got it, we've got it.
[06:04.800 --> 06:34.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to cover the waterfront on this live.
[06:34.080 --> 06:38.960]  July 7th, 2013, Sunday Transmission.
[06:38.960 --> 06:43.680]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I'm on the radio on my own broadcast.
[06:43.680 --> 06:49.640]  Six days a week, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central during the day.
[06:49.640 --> 06:53.840]  Back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. with a two-hour abbreviated transmission.
[06:53.840 --> 06:59.200]  I am very, very honored to be here talking to you today.
[06:59.200 --> 07:03.800]  I know we have people listening all over the world, not just in the United States or in
[07:03.800 --> 07:06.720]  Canada or in Mexico, here in North America.
[07:06.720 --> 07:13.520]  I am always humbled and completely blown away by when I go downtown to jog around the
[07:13.520 --> 07:22.000]  Hike and Bike Trail or I go to Barton Springs, that every other person I walk by is a listener.
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.280]  And that is a real sonar ping, as I call it, not bragging, hey, my show's big, but
[07:28.280 --> 07:33.720]  showing that we're really having a big effect, that if my broadcast, that is just one small
[07:33.720 --> 07:39.800]  part of the World Wide Liberty Movement, is affecting so many people.
[07:39.800 --> 07:47.040]  It's really incalculable, uncalculable, suddenly having a problem pronouncing these words.
[07:47.040 --> 07:48.040]  It is incalculable.
[07:48.040 --> 07:53.680]  Suddenly I'll be inventing ebonics like Jesse Jackson.
[07:53.680 --> 08:01.000]  Very hard to calculate exactly how many actual listeners that we have.
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.040]  And I ran into a guy whose dad's a 70-something-year-old farmer in Iowa, and they say they listen
[08:07.040 --> 08:08.640]  every Sunday.
[08:08.640 --> 08:13.000]  And right after I talked to him, I ran into people from Russia that were listeners, as
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.440]  I'm trying to walk out of Barton Springs today.
[08:15.440 --> 08:20.680]  And then as I get in the parking lot, I run into somebody who's visiting from Kansas,
[08:20.680 --> 08:21.680]  who's a listener.
[08:21.680 --> 08:26.240]  I mean, it's not just people in Austin, Texas.
[08:26.240 --> 08:30.080]  And then some guy could start his car, so I went to help jump his car, and he goes,
[08:30.080 --> 08:31.760]  well, thank you, Alex Jones.
[08:31.760 --> 08:36.040]  So again, I'm not bragging, hey, my broadcast is big.
[08:36.040 --> 08:38.520]  I'm telling you, there's hope out there.
[08:38.520 --> 08:41.160]  People are really waking up.
[08:41.160 --> 08:48.600]  Now best-selling author, longtime journalist, professor, history professor, former crime
[08:48.600 --> 08:54.480]  reporter for the Fort Worth Star Telegram, Jim Mars is going to be in studio in the next
[08:54.480 --> 08:58.120]  hour today to cover the waterfront.
[08:58.120 --> 09:09.360]  But he just came back from a big alternative energy meeting put on by Trammel Crow's son,
[09:09.360 --> 09:17.080]  and he saw it demonstrated machines off the shelf that can power your house off of hydrogen
[09:17.080 --> 09:18.080]  right now.
[09:18.080 --> 09:20.440]  And folks, you don't just grab hydrogen out of the air.
[09:20.440 --> 09:23.360]  It's one of the most plentiful gases in the atmosphere.
[09:23.360 --> 09:26.640]  It comes right out of water.
[09:26.640 --> 09:29.000]  And so this is a big, big deal.
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.960]  This is not pie in the sky.
[09:30.960 --> 09:36.400]  This is not questionable zero-point stuff.
[09:36.400 --> 09:40.840]  We're going to be talking about that and a lot more with Jim Mars.
[09:40.840 --> 09:46.600]  No protest is allowed at the 50th anniversary of Kennedy assassination.
[09:46.600 --> 09:53.720]  And by protest, they said no one is allowed in Dealey Plaza, the park, the public park.
[09:53.720 --> 09:56.640]  Only the government with the official story.
[09:56.640 --> 10:00.320]  And then the Dallas police said, by the way, this is in the newspaper, the Dallas Morning
[10:00.320 --> 10:04.080]  News and the other papers up there, no protest is allowed either.
[10:04.080 --> 10:08.640]  We won't issue permits for you to come and stand at the picket line with an alternate
[10:08.640 --> 10:09.880]  view.
[10:09.880 --> 10:12.680]  We're going to shovel the official story out.
[10:12.680 --> 10:13.680]  This is North Korea.
[10:13.680 --> 10:17.920]  Well, I'm going back to my hometown where I was born for the 50th anniversary coming
[10:17.920 --> 10:18.920]  up.
[10:18.920 --> 10:23.840]  I will be there exercising the evil First Amendment whether you give me a permit or
[10:23.840 --> 10:24.840]  not.
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.280]  I don't get permits when I march out of the Capitol and get in the lawmakers' faces
[10:29.280 --> 10:33.800]  and tell them what I think on the TSA or you name it.
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.280]  And so I'm certainly not going to go with hat in hand.
[10:37.280 --> 10:38.280]  What a joke.
[10:38.280 --> 10:42.240]  I'm going to be there exposing, you know, they have hundreds of national scientific
[10:42.240 --> 10:43.240]  polls.
[10:43.240 --> 10:44.240]  You've seen them out there.
[10:44.240 --> 10:48.920]  The average less than 10% believe the official JFK story, but we're not going to be getting
[10:48.920 --> 10:56.000]  off into JFK today, but I'll bring that up with Jim just briefly when he joins us.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.520]  Now, all of that said, we're going to get into the huge developments in Egypt, the economy
[11:01.520 --> 11:03.720]  and the bond market.
[11:03.720 --> 11:08.960]  We're going to look at the out-of-control police state from license plate scanning cameras
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.280]  to police locking down whole neighborhoods now for any reason they want, saying they're
[11:13.280 --> 11:15.640]  going in everyone's houses without warrants.
[11:15.640 --> 11:20.920]  This is the soft martial law being phased in.
[11:20.920 --> 11:26.760]  All of that and more will be discussed here on the broadcast today.
[11:26.760 --> 11:30.480]  But the first thing I want to talk about is the awakening that's happening.
[11:30.480 --> 11:36.880]  And I just kind of gave a prelude or a prelude to that a few minutes ago talking about how
[11:36.880 --> 11:40.680]  many people I talked to on the streets of England.
[11:40.680 --> 11:45.760]  I've done live feeds on the streets of London, just walking down the street doing a live
[11:45.760 --> 11:52.080]  feed in the dark at night in London and people hear my voice and every third or fourth person
[11:52.080 --> 12:00.480]  comes over and shakes my hand or I'm in broad daylight at Big Ben down on the bridge over
[12:00.480 --> 12:05.080]  the big river there.
[12:05.080 --> 12:11.200]  And people saw the live feed as dozens and dozens and dozens of people walking by were
[12:11.200 --> 12:13.280]  stopping and shaking my hand.
[12:13.280 --> 12:19.000]  That shows the level of people that are aware of what's going on out there.
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.360]  By the way, that live stream is saved on our use stream account for anybody that wants
[12:23.360 --> 12:24.800]  to go see that.
[12:24.800 --> 12:30.360]  So take heart, there's a huge awakening happening and it's not just my listeners.
[12:30.360 --> 12:36.520]  I tune in just as many of you do to other mainstream talk radio, alternative radio,
[12:36.520 --> 12:39.080]  C-SPAN you name it.
[12:39.080 --> 12:47.300]  And now when I watch C-SPAN, the majority of the callers on Washington Journal or other
[12:47.300 --> 12:54.040]  shows where after the interview they'll take 10, 15 minutes of calls, almost half the calls.
[12:54.040 --> 12:58.320]  Sometimes more, sometimes the majority, the vast majority.
[12:58.320 --> 13:03.680]  I've seen it where 15 phone calls in a row are anti-new world order, anti-authoritarian
[13:03.680 --> 13:04.880]  awake.
[13:04.880 --> 13:11.080]  But it's normally close to half, call in who are informed and involved and put these corrupt
[13:11.080 --> 13:17.760]  politicians and bureaucrats on the hot seat on a host of issues from Fast and Furious to
[13:17.760 --> 13:25.280]  open borders to our government, funding Al Qaeda to the NSA warrant was spying.
[13:25.280 --> 13:26.280]  America is awake.
[13:26.280 --> 13:27.720]  I want the rest of the world to know that.
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.560]  You've got a large segment of people that are in comas and have no idea of what's going
[13:31.560 --> 13:34.160]  on will probably never wake up.
[13:34.160 --> 13:35.960]  But they're spectators, they don't count.
[13:35.960 --> 13:41.720]  We have giant numbers of people who are informed and love liberty, who are now awake and that's
[13:41.720 --> 13:46.680]  why the power structure is trying to clamp down because they know they're in deep trouble.
[13:46.680 --> 13:58.760]  Now that said, today I was listening to talk radio out of Dallas and heard callers across
[13:58.760 --> 14:04.520]  the board criticizing the power structure, both political parties and talking about
[14:04.520 --> 14:07.440]  offshore banks that have taken this country over.
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.920]  And the show wasn't even, that I heard for 20 minutes in the car, wasn't even talking
[14:12.920 --> 14:14.360]  about those topics.
[14:14.360 --> 14:16.280]  That's all callers wanted to talk about.
[14:16.280 --> 14:23.360]  Then I was driving in to do this radio show in my own South Austin studios and heard our
[14:23.360 --> 14:32.000]  local affiliate 590 that's in North Austin, heard the local host who's on before me take
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.440]  more than 10 calls in a row before I had to get out of the car and come here and get
[14:35.440 --> 14:41.400]  ready for the show and every one of them said, I don't trust the government.
[14:41.400 --> 14:43.040]  I don't trust the police.
[14:43.040 --> 14:45.120]  I don't trust the system anymore.
[14:45.120 --> 14:49.520]  And they would all apologize and say, I'm a big Republican conservative law and order
[14:49.520 --> 14:58.440]  person who used to worship the police listeners listening on 590 probably heard it every caller.
[14:58.440 --> 14:59.440]  I counted.
[14:59.440 --> 15:00.440]  It was 10 in a row.
[15:00.440 --> 15:05.120]  I sat, I drove over here for 20 something minutes sat in the car for about 10 listening
[15:05.120 --> 15:07.360]  to it and already gotten ready for the show at home.
[15:07.360 --> 15:09.440]  So I came in here like 15 minutes for airtime.
[15:09.440 --> 15:14.840]  So I listened to about 30 minutes of it or so, maybe 25 and every caller, every caller
[15:14.840 --> 15:21.240]  every caller, even though the host and that's their right was kind of saying, hey, maybe
[15:21.240 --> 15:24.160]  the police need to be able to come in your house.
[15:24.160 --> 15:29.280]  If they want to surveil the neighbors, you know, maybe that's a good thing playing devil's
[15:29.280 --> 15:34.520]  advocate and not one caller called in and agreed with it.
[15:34.520 --> 15:36.520]  And these people are all saying they've awoken.
[15:36.520 --> 15:37.600]  The government's corrupt.
[15:37.600 --> 15:38.680]  It's out of control.
[15:38.680 --> 15:39.680]  And you know what?
[15:39.680 --> 15:40.680]  That's true.
[15:40.680 --> 15:44.120]  But it doesn't mean that you can't trust the police themselves on average.
[15:44.120 --> 15:50.680]  It means that people understand those on top are bad and they see the abuses.
[15:50.680 --> 15:56.480]  Everyone sees the arrogant imperial behavior out of government and big corporations and

[20:01.280 --> 20:12.080]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:12.080 --> 20:32.520]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:32.520 --> 20:38.360]  By the way, I'm going to have some breaking news, this is breaking world news in just
[20:38.360 --> 20:39.360]  a moment.
[20:39.360 --> 20:48.520]  If any press would like to scoop us, I will give you the intelligence, the information.
[20:48.520 --> 20:55.080]  You can go to the video on infowars.com and give us no credit and break this because I've
[20:55.080 --> 21:01.440]  only got one writer on staff on Sunday and that's Adon Salazar, I know he's listening
[21:01.440 --> 21:07.000]  right now, maybe he'll want to write about this or Paul Watson will when I've got like
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.440]  seven or eight writers working on Monday mornings.
[21:10.440 --> 21:17.080]  But this will be big breaking news and I've gone and checked when I saw this this morning
[21:17.080 --> 21:24.160]  on DrudgeReport.com and I saw it on infowars.com and I went and read through the news and they
[21:24.160 --> 21:28.160]  said that it was Muslim brotherhood they thought that was beheading and throwing people off
[21:28.160 --> 21:37.720]  roofs and beating nonviolent people's brains out in Alexandria, Egypt and Cairo, Egypt.
[21:37.720 --> 21:44.400]  Well I still the video and we're going to tell you what that video shows in a moment
[21:44.400 --> 21:48.840]  and by the way, anyone could look at this and tell you who it is and every time I see
[21:48.840 --> 21:54.640]  this behavior these people are waving this particular black flag, we're going to talk
[21:54.640 --> 21:59.600]  about this particular black flag in just a moment and what it signifies, oh and those
[21:59.600 --> 22:03.960]  squares full of millions of people now against the Egyptian military, they're flying a particular
[22:03.960 --> 22:05.520]  black flag as well.
[22:05.520 --> 22:10.800]  I noticed that this morning at the head of the demonstration, let me just break the news
[22:10.800 --> 22:17.600]  right now and then I'm going to show viewers the actual flag and video for infowars listeners.
[22:17.600 --> 22:23.560]  I'll tell you how to go to infowars and read the article, it's the article about protestors
[22:23.560 --> 22:30.200]  from the Daily Mail, throw people off of a roof, it's protesting to throw them off
[22:30.200 --> 22:35.960]  a roof, wow I didn't, I can go throw people, I disagree with off a roof and when the cops
[22:35.960 --> 22:40.440]  show up I'll say I'm just protesting but it's interesting, who are those protestors?
[22:40.440 --> 22:48.160]  Well they've got big beards, big black beards and shaved heads and they're waving black
[22:48.160 --> 22:59.640]  flags behind them that say in Arabic Al Qaeda and you can search the Al Qaeda flag and see
[22:59.640 --> 23:04.720]  Bin Laden with it and you can compare it, it's the exact same flag, it is Al Qaeda that our
[23:04.720 --> 23:08.480]  government is openly, it's not like they're part of it and oh there might be some Al
[23:08.480 --> 23:12.480]  Qaeda in there, we're trying to, no no, the group our government's trying to put in power
[23:12.480 --> 23:18.520]  all over the world is the real hardest of the hard Al Qaeda.
[23:18.520 --> 23:23.400]  I've even seen press reports implying that the secularists are the ones killing people,
[23:23.400 --> 23:29.920]  that is not what's going on, we're going to break that down and show the video, anybody
[23:29.920 --> 23:35.080]  can watch it infowars.com, we're streaming free video to everybody who's a radio listener,
[23:35.080 --> 23:42.560]  you want to go see it, if not you can also just go to infowars.com, Egyptian violence,
[23:42.560 --> 23:49.440]  gangs throw rivals to their deaths from the top of buildings, the Daily Mirror.
[23:49.440 --> 23:56.520]  Other press, I saw actually had the headline about protestors throw people from rooftops,
[23:56.520 --> 23:59.920]  they're a special type of protester and we're going to be going over that but first let
[23:59.920 --> 24:05.720]  me get back to what I was mentioning earlier for people, we have a Mike Adams story that
[24:05.720 --> 24:12.920]  went viral from naturalnews.com upon infowars.com yesterday titled militarized police gone wild
[24:12.920 --> 24:18.800]  across America and it just gives examples from the last few weeks of oh somebody shot
[24:18.800 --> 24:22.400]  off fireworks, we're locking down the whole neighborhood and searching all your houses
[24:22.400 --> 24:26.280]  without warrants, somebody shot guns in the air, we're locking down the whole neighborhood
[24:26.280 --> 24:31.660]  and calling in SWAT teams and interrogating everyone without warrants, oh we want to commandeer
[24:31.660 --> 24:38.600]  your house to see if the neighbor ever yells at his wife, we want a tactical advantage,
[24:38.600 --> 24:45.240]  that's like a magic word, it's supposed to open your wrist up and feed them, your life's
[24:45.240 --> 24:49.160]  blood if they use the word tactical and we're supposed to get all sycophantically creamy
[24:49.160 --> 24:56.960]  eyed over that but Nevada police face rare third amendment lawsuit for forced commandeering
[24:56.960 --> 25:03.520]  of homes and I heard the debate on the radio today here locally about well is it unconstitutional,
[25:03.520 --> 25:11.160]  yeah it's called the third amendment to the evil bill of rights and it says no soldier
[25:11.160 --> 25:14.360]  and that's what our police have been turned into that paramilitary forces that have been
[25:14.360 --> 25:18.840]  trained that quote we are all insurgents that's Washington Post headline a few weeks ago or
[25:18.840 --> 25:23.560]  I guess a month ago was the police are trained, the general public are insurgents, well yeah
[25:23.560 --> 25:28.200]  and then they come back from Iraq and come back from Afghanistan and they're either
[25:28.200 --> 25:32.840]  hired by the police force and called heroes or they're not and then called the number
[25:32.840 --> 25:36.440]  one terror threat and I don't agree that our returning veterans are the number one terror
[25:36.440 --> 25:43.480]  threat but a lot of the unstable ones on record are actually hired into the force, no soldier
[25:43.480 --> 25:47.480]  shall in time of peace be quartered in any house but that's just the bill of rights
[25:47.480 --> 25:51.880]  and what George Washington supported I mean that's all that radical extremist you know
[25:51.880 --> 25:57.640]  I mean everybody knows the new American flag is a black boot being licked, it goes on no
[25:57.640 --> 26:03.320]  soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner
[26:03.320 --> 26:12.600]  nor in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed by law so they've got to pass an emergency
[26:12.600 --> 26:20.120]  law specifically saying in this area you know the the the red coats have taken over so we've
[26:20.120 --> 26:23.960]  got to like have the military going and fight house to house and commandeer this house or
[26:23.960 --> 26:29.320]  this church because people in Europe had always gone through this the police just coming in
[26:29.320 --> 26:33.320]  your house without warrants the military coming your house without warrants the lord coming
[26:33.320 --> 26:38.920]  your house without a warrant so they had the Magna Carta in 1215 the basis of all modern
[26:38.920 --> 26:43.640]  common law bill of rights constitution the reason america has been prosperous the reason
[26:43.640 --> 26:48.360]  you could own a business and not have some L hefe come shake you down like mexico or
[26:48.360 --> 26:55.480]  north korea or some don like idly or some lord like they had in england come shake you down
[26:55.480 --> 26:59.800]  and say by the way I want your daughter I want your food I want to put me up in your house
[26:59.800 --> 27:07.400]  the Magna Carta said the lowest peasant in a lean to this is actually what the Magna Carta says
[27:07.400 --> 27:19.080]  this the lowest peasant in a dirt tent the king cannot enter his house without a warrant
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.800]  with an oath or affirmation which specifically what they're looking for and by the way the
[27:23.800 --> 27:29.080]  witnesses that swear they saw something guess what happens to them if they get caught swearing
[27:29.080 --> 27:34.200]  out a fake oath or affirmation and you get to face a recuser guess what you face under Magna
[27:34.200 --> 27:41.240]  Carta and then through other common laws between five to 20 years in prison and if you made a false
[27:41.240 --> 27:47.320]  claim where the charge could be death the penalty on the person guess what you got for a false claim
[27:47.960 --> 27:57.320]  you got you bet it begins with a big D death death death death death death death to come in
[27:57.320 --> 28:03.480]  someone's house without a warrant death that's the foundation of all liberty and that's why
[28:03.480 --> 28:09.160]  we have all this prosperity because people could build things and not have it stolen by the state
[28:09.160 --> 28:15.000]  the most dangerous thing in history and this religion in america now of worshiping the state
[28:15.000 --> 28:20.600]  that is now going going bad like rotten milk going out like rotten eggs going out like you
[28:20.600 --> 28:26.200]  know what in church good it's gone and all of you that are bootleckers of the system because
[28:26.200 --> 28:30.360]  I hear it constantly and think you're going to get power out of cozying up to it you may
[28:30.360 --> 28:37.240]  for another short season but it's coming to an end because I have seen it politically I have seen
[28:37.240 --> 28:41.080]  it historically that's why you see this attempt for this takeover it's not going to work it's
[28:41.080 --> 28:46.600]  going to backfire the tighter they squeeze the more resistance it will form the people are
[28:46.600 --> 28:53.720]  awakening and I want the police and the military to join us in the bill of rights the constitution
[28:53.720 --> 29:02.600]  and it's root the Magna Carta and we come back breaking al-qaeda news isn't wi-fi great you can

[34:01.800 --> 34:08.760]  but at the top it's corrupt and the direction the evolution of government and the system here
[34:08.760 --> 34:15.000]  is diametrically opposed on every front to the principles that made this country great
[34:15.640 --> 34:22.360]  and the principles that made other countries great i mean we know the direction we're going in
[34:22.360 --> 34:32.280]  is bad news we know it and the good news is all over this country i see the polls i see the numbers
[34:32.280 --> 34:39.080]  i see the reaction the people are waking up but just finishing up here nevada police face rare
[34:39.080 --> 34:46.520]  third amendment lawsuit for forced commandeering of homes adan salazar wrote this on friday and it's
[34:46.520 --> 34:51.880]  since gotten more attention around the country family arrested for not immediately surrendering
[34:51.880 --> 34:57.560]  their home and they arrested the father and the son and then grabbed the mother and threw her out
[34:57.560 --> 35:03.160]  on the street for not letting them come in there the home not for a hostage situation which would
[35:03.160 --> 35:11.480]  still be questionable but to quote surveil from a tactical position whether the neighbors
[35:12.280 --> 35:16.520]  were having any type of domestic dispute that's the new excuse and you see it all the time with
[35:16.520 --> 35:22.440]  the cops show them go we heard there was a dispute we're coming in without a warrant or we heard
[35:22.440 --> 35:26.840]  there was this or that and meanwhile the crack dealers are down on the corner meanwhile the
[35:26.840 --> 35:32.920]  big central banks are laundering the drug money meanwhile the major banks are on record laundering
[35:32.920 --> 35:38.440]  the drug money i mean it's just all a joke okay we have the biggest prison population in the world
[35:38.440 --> 35:44.520]  not not just per capita bigger than the communist chinese that have a billion 300 million people
[35:44.520 --> 35:51.480]  we're only 320 million and it gets bigger and bigger and hungrier and hungrier we have the
[35:51.480 --> 35:58.440]  biggest government the world's ever seen the u.s government look these numbers up it varies
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.440]  is two to two and a half times bigger than the communist chinese government
[36:03.560 --> 36:07.880]  and we have roughly double the people in prison than the communist chinese government
[36:08.840 --> 36:13.160]  now technically they actually have some big work camps that they that aren't called prison so
[36:13.160 --> 36:19.800]  they probably got a bigger total but this is the reality and people say well good we have criminals
[36:19.800 --> 36:26.120]  in there what we have is people being sent for nonviolent offenses who are told if you don't join
[36:26.120 --> 36:32.360]  the black racist gang the hispanic racist gang the asian racist gang the white racist gang
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.000]  that's how the cell blocks are set up in any medium to maximum security facility
[36:37.720 --> 36:42.840]  even the lower security ones are going to that you are immediately thrown in you get the swastika
[36:42.840 --> 36:49.480]  tattoo or you get the black racist tattoo and you bend over literally or they're going to shank
[36:49.480 --> 36:56.760]  you to death and by the way they give orders to the warden most of these prisons are nothing
[36:56.760 --> 37:03.400]  but drug dealing mafia dens with criminals inside running criminal networks on the outside that have
[37:03.400 --> 37:13.080]  bought the jail guards this is the reality ladies and gentlemen now the guys have pulled up some
[37:13.080 --> 37:18.680]  statistics there what is that from the world bank showing the u.s with the highest prison
[37:18.680 --> 37:24.360]  population in the world yeah two million two hundred and something hundred by the way that's
[37:24.360 --> 37:28.200]  an old number and that's not correct it's like four and a half million currently in u.s prisons
[37:29.640 --> 37:33.240]  yeah that's a well even three years ago that number is not correct that must be one type of
[37:33.240 --> 37:37.720]  prisoner because it's over four mil russia's number two and eight hundred and forty seven
[37:37.720 --> 37:42.440]  thousand rwanda fifty nine thousand you notice china's not even on the list because they don't
[37:42.440 --> 37:50.040]  call it prison they call it reeducation when they cut your organs out and sell them to wealthy
[37:50.040 --> 37:55.000]  lessoners who fly into japan to get them and they they got you on the tarmac and mobile execution
[37:55.000 --> 38:02.280]  vans so they're fresh put the goods on the plane an hour from then it's in tokyo two hours later
[38:02.280 --> 38:09.640]  it's implanted in your body you by the way you're a new listener i don't joke about anything or i
[38:09.640 --> 38:16.440]  tell you it's a joke each chinese city for more than fifteen years has more than a dozen mobile
[38:16.440 --> 38:22.840]  execution vans going 24 hours a day chopping out all the goods so they're the tax man really
[38:22.840 --> 38:29.080]  cometh doesn't he and their favorite is the fall on gong nonviolent group because they don't eat
[38:29.080 --> 38:34.040]  drink or smoke and are so healthy and they blood type them and they wait they wait in their jail
[38:34.040 --> 38:41.560]  cell till a rich westerner or someone in asia europe and russia of africa whoever's wealthy
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.320]  gets the good so just type in mobile execution vans if you want to see that
[38:45.320 --> 38:49.640]  so we'll be getting to that but first off before uh jim mars comes in and i cover the
[38:49.640 --> 38:54.520]  waterfront of news with him let me get into what's happening over in egypt for those that don't know
[38:54.520 --> 39:05.640]  uh there in uh the eastern tip of north africa africa man let me tell you about what's going on
[39:05.640 --> 39:13.720]  there our government run by foreign banks narcotics trafficking banks on record three years ago
[39:14.360 --> 39:20.840]  three and a half years ago hazy mubarak the 31 year cia trained dictator but he was not that brutal
[39:20.840 --> 39:26.280]  compared to most uh that's why that was the problem was ordered to support al qaeda rebels being
[39:26.280 --> 39:33.640]  brought in out of egypt into neighboring libya and he said no so he disappeared and the rest is history
[39:34.840 --> 39:41.240]  then two years after that they put in mohammed morsey who is a muslim brotherhood british
[39:41.240 --> 39:48.600]  intelligence cia operative on record and they began blowing up the shia mosque blowing up the
[39:48.600 --> 39:54.040]  yellow white mosque blowing up the synagogues and blowing up the churches and crucifying christians
[39:54.040 --> 39:59.480]  every day at the presidential palace on record and they set people on fire and if you don't believe
[39:59.480 --> 40:04.440]  me just type in christians crucified egypt you can watch the video there's hundreds of them
[40:06.200 --> 40:11.800]  and i just so happen to notice when i see these videos the flags at these public burnings and
[40:11.800 --> 40:16.120]  stonings were al qaeda flags just type in al qaeda flag you'll see bin laden with it
[40:16.120 --> 40:23.240]  and what it says in arabic the one we have on screen for tv viewers is the militia flag of al qaeda
[40:24.760 --> 40:30.680]  the wahhabist flag and then above it is the asama bin laden a particular army flag in fact
[40:30.680 --> 40:34.360]  you scroll down you can see the army flag of asama bin laden you see that right there
[40:34.360 --> 40:42.200]  so that is the wahhabist sovi arabian flag of al qaeda and so now the army which has been western
[40:42.200 --> 40:47.960]  trained and given billions of dollars a year and have 16s and abram's tanks um they like their
[40:47.960 --> 40:53.160]  girls go into college they don't like uh that the muslim brotherhood because they're thugs too on
[40:53.160 --> 40:58.280]  average like any tyranny not north korea like mexico i mean that we don't want our cops to come
[40:58.280 --> 41:02.440]  like that but no they're they're very you know somewhat thuggish but it's so dangerous there
[41:02.440 --> 41:06.360]  they're a little more professional on their thuggism because they're sitting on top of a powder keg
[41:06.360 --> 41:12.120]  of an egyptian population that's doubled the last 20 years and has set the double again i mean it is
[41:12.120 --> 41:18.520]  a powder keg and that's one of the biggest biggest issues so so let's go to this show the egyptian
[41:18.520 --> 41:23.960]  military a week ago comes to moracy and says you've got to step down there's 14 million on the street
[41:23.960 --> 41:28.200]  secularist and other groups that don't want to be slaves of al qaeda and have their daughters
[41:28.200 --> 41:32.760]  sexually mutilated and they don't want christians crucified the streets of the presidential palace
[41:32.760 --> 41:36.360]  he says i won't step down well the army didn't have a choice they had to make him step down
[41:36.360 --> 41:43.400]  now al qaeda is running around with black flags killing everybody and this is footage edit full
[41:43.400 --> 41:49.400]  wars dot com bbc is also running this but not but they're saying we don't know who this is
[41:49.400 --> 41:54.520]  killing people it's men with big black beards and al qaeda flags you can see that sticking out of a
[41:54.520 --> 42:01.880]  shirt and and there's a bunch of these videos and they climb up and are throwing secular you can see
[42:01.880 --> 42:07.880]  them western dressed with short hair secular men men that you know don't want to kneel to al qaeda
[42:07.880 --> 42:12.920]  off of the roof and warning this is graphic footage if you're watching us on tv radio listeners
[42:12.920 --> 42:19.800]  just go to info wars dot com and uh you can you can see the al qaeda men with their flags throwing
[42:20.680 --> 42:26.760]  children oh i forgot some of these are as young as seven being thrown off five stories and but
[42:26.760 --> 42:31.960]  still they're crawling in pools of blood at the bottom al qaeda comes over with machetes and hacks
[42:31.960 --> 42:39.480]  them in the head with waving al qaeda flags you know kind of like the american flag or the chinese
[42:39.480 --> 42:45.400]  flag or by those little flag is the mexican flag no one's saying gee what flag is that that army
[42:45.400 --> 42:53.000]  has al qaeda when they get shot by the egyptian army our media is decrying the army who is stopping
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.520]  al qaeda trying to storm the government buildings right now and our government is backing al qaeda
[42:58.520 --> 43:05.000]  as usual why does the united states spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world on healthcare
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.320]  why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and
[43:11.320 --> 43:18.600]  every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what we eat our food is devoid of

[51:55.880 --> 52:01.160]  and our media keeps saying they don't know who's doing it when they've got their flags and our
[52:01.160 --> 52:06.680]  government and nato is backing al-qaeda and the muslim brotherhood what is really behind that
[52:07.480 --> 52:13.480]  well uh i think they can't admit that it's actually uh al-qaeda because we have been conditioned and
[52:13.480 --> 52:20.680]  programmed and propagandized against al-qaeda since long before uh 9 11 and of course 9 11 it was
[52:20.680 --> 52:25.240]  osama bin laden and al-qaeda they're our big enemies that's why we had to invade all these
[52:25.240 --> 52:30.440]  countries over in the middle east but i want to give a brief history lesson here okay let's go
[52:30.440 --> 52:39.080]  back to the 1930s and the muslim iman who founded the muslim brotherhood uh he was enamored of a
[52:39.080 --> 52:45.320]  fellow in europe who had a big a national socialist movement going on named adolf hitler that was the
[52:45.320 --> 52:51.800]  imam of jerusalem and the imam of turkey mm-hmm so he he wrote to adolf hitler and adolf hitler
[52:51.800 --> 52:57.000]  wrote him back and decided hey here's a chance uh here's the opportunity to get our foot in the
[52:57.000 --> 53:03.080]  middle east so uh by the time of war muslim brotherhood invited them to invade yeah well by the
[53:03.080 --> 53:09.960]  time of world war two the muslim brotherhood was a nazi organization all right and uh during world
[53:09.960 --> 53:16.760]  war two when we were fighting in north africa we had about as much trouble with the muslim brotherhood
[53:16.760 --> 53:24.360]  arabs as we did with the nazi troops uh in the africa corps okay after the war the more we won
[53:24.360 --> 53:29.720]  the war well british then took over north africa but they were war weary they had plenty on their
[53:29.720 --> 53:37.400]  hands so they turned uh the muslim brotherhood over to the cia all right so people who's really
[53:37.960 --> 53:42.760]  the skull and bones globalist branch exactly they were the eastern establishment and not really
[53:42.760 --> 53:50.840]  americans not truly now you have to understand then that the cia has run uh our kata since
[53:50.840 --> 53:57.560]  after war war two all right now our kata then uh that name came up on record on this is all on
[53:57.560 --> 54:05.080]  record this is all well documented uh ozama bin laden who is a saudi uh then gets uh he's brought
[54:05.080 --> 54:10.280]  to this country under the name tim osman that's declassified this is not our opinion this is this
[54:10.280 --> 54:17.000]  is not conspiracy theory this is all fact he's armed trained by the united states and sent to
[54:17.000 --> 54:24.360]  afghanistan to form the mojadine okay that was with general hami gul we've had on right he's
[54:24.360 --> 54:30.040]  confirmed all that and then so we were supporting them against the russians as our proxies in
[54:30.040 --> 54:37.640]  afghanistan now uh after during afghanistan and after afghanistan everybody knew that the muslim
[54:37.640 --> 54:43.400]  brotherhood had a bad reputation because they'd been this nazi organization so ozama bin laden
[54:43.960 --> 54:50.680]  took his hardcore group and they changed the name to our kata which by the way literally means
[54:50.680 --> 54:57.080]  the base now early on i thought well that must mean their headquarters somewhere right uh no alex
[54:58.120 --> 55:04.360]  the uh mp and um that killed him a week after robin cook a week after he went public and said
[55:04.360 --> 55:12.440]  that's the name of the ci database yes he said it's the database that the ci keeps of arab muslim
[55:13.160 --> 55:18.440]  operatives that they can of course call up and get them to do anything they want them to do so
[55:18.440 --> 55:24.520]  it's really really important for your listeners uh to share the information that when they hear
[55:24.520 --> 55:33.560]  al-qaeda they hear ci a that's who's been al-ci aida al-ci aida that's exactly and and now they're
[55:33.560 --> 55:38.680]  running them in libya running them in syria and now they're running them against the army of egypt
[55:38.680 --> 55:43.800]  and our government for the first few days was saying the army was wrong the truth is moracy
[55:43.800 --> 55:49.480]  turned the country over to al-qaeda not just muslim brotherhood to just run around slaughtering people
[55:49.480 --> 55:54.760]  why is obama funding groups that are killing christians in egypt well and we see the same
[55:54.760 --> 56:01.080]  thing happening in syria now i'm not trying to say that the government syria is a wonderful no but
[56:01.080 --> 56:06.040]  they didn't start this and then start it and they're not killing the christians it's the rebels
[56:06.040 --> 56:11.400]  killing the christians and killing the jews and we're funding them and we're giving them the arms
[56:11.400 --> 56:17.080]  it's incredible folks you have no idea what's going on in your name and with your tax money
[56:17.080 --> 56:23.320]  man i tell you who do you think obama really is because uh there's a muslim socialist period in
[56:23.320 --> 56:28.680]  the story i mean he himself said so you know yeah and but i used to think that was just like a cia
[56:28.680 --> 56:32.200]  cover yeah i think there i think there may actually be an illuminati doublecross here
[56:33.080 --> 56:38.600]  well the the thing is napoleon teamed up with these guys for a while well that's it in in high
[56:38.600 --> 56:44.840]  level politics you know the alliance is form and then break apart and form again and and when you
[56:44.840 --> 56:50.440]  get to that level it's just whoever can benefit you well here's my point i don't want tsa acting
[56:50.440 --> 56:55.240]  like i'm a terrorist to look for ben laden in my underwear and my wife's was here when we all know
[56:55.240 --> 56:59.240]  this is a fraud so now when i get there in the act like i've done something wrong i go look you all
[56:59.240 --> 57:03.320]  know the government runs al-qaeda and then when the customs says you have drugs i go no you know
[57:03.320 --> 57:08.520]  the government ships them in and two levels of customs went yeah we know that to me at the airport
[57:08.520 --> 57:13.880]  at dallas it's like everyone knows this it's like leave me alone i'm not part of your murdering new
[57:13.880 --> 57:19.560]  world order i've got stopped acting like i'm guilty i've got a bumper sticker you love it says dare
[57:19.560 --> 57:26.600]  to get the cia off drugs absolutely or or or ron paul's favorite sticker on his desk for 40 years
[57:26.600 --> 57:31.400]  don't steal the government hates competition that's exactly right that's exactly and the point is it's
[57:31.400 --> 57:36.200]  getting worse we need to reverse this now i mean just look at what government's doing we'll be back

[59:58.920 --> 1:00:07.880]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:11.640]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:20.760]  all right jim mars is going to be with us for the entire second hour and i promise
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:26.920]  to be a good boy and give the phone number out in the next segment so in the last two segments
[1:00:26.920 --> 1:00:33.080]  of the hour you can call in with your question for jim but i beg the listeners when i give this
[1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:38.680]  number out that i'll do at the start of the next segment please actually call in with a question for
[1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:45.640]  jim mars uh because i want to you know actually hear kind of the wildcard angles that you'll bring
[1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:52.280]  up and take him to jim let me ask you this question in this brief segment we've got a do you think
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:59.720]  there's a mass awakening happening and b how big is it and c did the system overplay its hand where
[1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:03.400]  it's in the mainstream news the government launders most of the drug money and that brings the drugs
[1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:07.960]  in and that private banks get the profit and that private groups are using the nsa to spy on their
[1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:14.520]  enemies and blackmail people and that the government really runs al-qaeda and i mean everything we've
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:21.880]  talked about is now being proven correct and they can't even kill jim mars or alex jones i've figured
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:26.440]  that out they could kill us they still might but but it won't do anything because it's the messages
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:32.200]  out there it's like we're just people that see the obvious we're nothing special yeah it's really
[1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:37.480]  amazing knowing i totally agree with you i think there is a huge mass consciousness raising going
[1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:44.520]  on uh you number one though most people think that they're isolated because they don't hear any of
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:51.400]  this in the mainstream corporate media all right it's absolutely incredible uh about a month ago
[1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:58.120]  there were 53 cities in this country that had massive demonstrations against the uh genetically
[1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:04.040]  modified organisms of monsoon no coverage and there was no coverage that's not news folks that's
[1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:10.040]  not journalism that is propaganda and suppression of the news but they get news from you they get
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:15.960]  news off the internet there's all kinds of people out there yes the consciousness is rising uh but
[1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:20.920]  the problem is number one most people think that they're the only ones because they don't hear
[1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:28.520]  their views and the information parroted in the uh or mirrored in the uh mainstream mass media and
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:33.240]  the second thing is is they're kind of like the deer caught in the headlights they know something's
[1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:39.240]  wrong they know something's bad they know there's a lot of stuff going on but they just it's what do
[1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:44.360]  we do about it what do we do about it because and it's a good question it's a valid question because
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:49.720]  do you go vote no they control the vote through the voting machines they skew the numbers you know
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:57.160]  almost every major vote the last few years has always been 48 to 52 51 to 49 it's always just
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:02.280]  within a few short that is extremely astute what you said and i'm not just like i'm being patronizing
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:07.000]  here because that's what i've the realization i've come to myself deeply thinking on this
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:12.040]  most people know they're in trouble most people are aware something's going on but they're never
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:16.920]  given validation by the dinosaur media that still doesn't have that many viewers or readers
[1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:22.680]  but people still think it's authoritative even if they don't trust it they don't see it agreeing
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:28.040]  so they still feel small they don't understand that if they're at jim mars or alex jones people
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:33.640]  and recognize and come up to you then you realize how many people are awake it's incredible it absolutely
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:39.320]  is and i travel a lot and uh east coast west coast all around you know through the central
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:45.720]  midwest and there's just people everywhere but they think they're isolated because they never
[1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:51.400]  see those views reflected in the corporate mass media and then even if they do you you answer the
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:55.640]  question one second part what do you do so i so i want to talk with you about some solutions
[1:03:56.280 --> 1:04:02.040]  when we come back in general and then the big solution i i just see so many cons out there
[1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:06.040]  i know there's a lot of real stuff but then there's also cons using it to make money with
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:10.760]  oh free energy perpetual motion machines but there's real stuff with hydrogen and other things
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:16.120]  that really are the answer to everything uh because if we have enough wealth and enough energy and
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.920]  end artificial scarcity it's over i want to see that happen and you've been doing some deep research
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:25.880]  absolutely you mentioned hydrogen just stop and think about this what is the most plentiful
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:31.720]  element in the world hydrogen hydrogen why is that because the world is predominantly water
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:37.400]  and what's water h2o two parts hydrogen one part oxygen there's more hydrogen there and there
[1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:42.120]  well that's why in the film which is based on you know science um that that you said last night
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:47.960]  you haven't seen that you should go see um the one with a tom cruise that just came out oblivion
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:53.000]  that's what the ships they're taking away is our water for that for a hydrogen jump but but stay
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:57.400]  there we're going to get into real science with the one the only gem are straight ahead
[1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:05.880]  there is an increased need to support our immunity and health at silver lungs we are

[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:13.240]  oh we are live ladies and gentlemen told friend number to join us your specific questions for
[1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:18.360]  best-selling author jim marz that's in studio with us the toll free number to get involved on this
[1:07:18.360 --> 1:07:31.960]  live july 7 sunday transmission is 877789 alex 8777892539 your calls coming up at the bottom of the
[1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:39.080]  hour well joining us from the countryside outside dfw is jim marz now in studio with us
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:45.800]  jim marz.com is another new york times top 10 best-seller and he joins us right now but you've
[1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:50.520]  been involved with some of the bigwigs who are really looking into the real alternative energy
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:56.920]  not free energy not magic stuff there's a lot of cons out there and also people that have built
[1:07:56.920 --> 1:08:02.360]  things that are real but there's not a real way to extract it they're impractical i've been a real
[1:08:02.360 --> 1:08:08.200]  study of alternative energy and it is the big kahuna because energy is power the federal reserve
[1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:12.760]  puts out fake dollars it's not really federal reserve the federal reserve notes are not really
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:17.000]  dollars they're federal reserve notes but with those symbols of energy they can get the world
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:22.600]  so they kind of have a perpetual motion machine while they try to create artificial scarcity
[1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:27.480]  that's why obama let's cue that clip up from last week told africans you can't have air conditioning
[1:08:27.480 --> 1:08:32.920]  you can't have a car you can't have a good life that's bad for the earth while the gmo is destroying
[1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:38.120]  the planet while the globalists are blocking the clean alternative energies and putting out fake
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:44.680]  windmills so they're select buddies and cylindra not even building the complexes meanwhile there are
[1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:52.440]  real solutions in energy and you have been doing research into this this is mainline technology
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:57.640]  around for a long time that's ready to be deployed right now but as you told me last night and i've
[1:08:57.640 --> 1:09:02.520]  seen this in the news any company that tries to really put this out the directors commit suicide
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:07.960]  they get arkans cited uh very very very very very quickly they fall down and hit their head or
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:15.720]  or uh go close the garage door and turn on the car jim mars break down the the the true cutting edge
[1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:21.960]  and what could revolutionize everything people want solutions here it is okay well let's let
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:26.440]  this goes all the way back let's go back to the turn of the 20th century and rudolf diesel
[1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:35.800]  invented a diesel engine that he originally designed to run on organic matter okay you remember
[1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:41.160]  the uh back to the future movie and they put banana peels and and i don't know coffee grounds and
[1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:47.560]  stuff in the little uh fusion thing to to run the time machine he built a diesel to run on
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:53.320]  organic matter but that would have interfered with the petroleum base industry so what happened
[1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:59.240]  to rudolf diesel gee it was terribly fell overboard crossing the english channel too bad
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:03.800]  now and that goes all the way back i could we don't have the time but i could sit here and give you
[1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:10.440]  at least a dozen examples some of which i had direct personal experience the fbi on record
[1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:16.440]  rated tesla's laboratory oh yeah tesla you know he he's burned his laboratory down there's there's
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:21.160]  things going on right now today some years back there was a kid up in the northwest who said i've
[1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:27.560]  got a i've developed a carburetor that'll get a hundred miles on one gallon of gas and he got
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:31.960]  reporters he drove them a hundred miles they checked it out they've made sure there wasn't
[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:37.880]  any some trick to it it was legit what happened to that it's gone again by the way i've seen
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:43.560]  magazines in the 60s and stuff general motors and ford with carburetors with 75 miles to the gallon
[1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:48.920]  cars that go 150 miles an hour and you tell me the japanese today can't do that well the germans
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:54.200]  are making a Volkswagen over in europe right now that's getting 56 60 miles of the gallon but you
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:11:00.600]  can't buy it in the united states okay and why is that okay because the elite the very people
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:07.880]  you're always preaching about these people have a monopoly based on petroleum all right it's that
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:14.200]  simple and anything that comes up that's going to threaten that they buy it up if they don't buy it
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:19.080]  up then they then they just find and they're going to try to use on record the shortage of it in the
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:24.760]  next 50 years because they're going to artificially make it scarce to take control of the entire human
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:31.160]  civilization and that is wrong well most people truly believe today that the reason we fought in
[1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:37.400]  iraq afghanistan syria all these countries into egypt is because we're trying to get their oil
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:42.680]  well we don't need oil we don't need all leslie clark declassified that actually illegally i mean
[1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:47.880]  he admitted he was in the pentagon and saw the plan to not let those countries sell the oil
[1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:53.240]  to create artificial scarcity saddam's crime was over pumping exactly in fact see people don't
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:57.400]  realize that i hear people all the time say well we invaded iraq because we wanted to steal their
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:03.800]  oil let me tell you something folks we were only getting 16 percent of our imported oil from iraq
[1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:09.160]  prior to our invasion and once we invaded then they said some of the oil feels on fire there was
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:14.360]  fighting going on we didn't even get that much they cut down the amount of oil we were getting from
[1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:21.400]  iraq people don't get artificial scarcity i wake up the old companies are capping oil fields all
[1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:27.400]  over the u.s the biggest oil oil reserve in the united states and if anybody remembers their history
[1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:32.600]  which they don't you may recall that the biggest scandal early in the 20th century was the teapot
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:37.960]  dome scandal that's where the government was selling off drilling rights to the naval oil reserves
[1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:43.960]  out in california teapot dome and it caused a huge scandal and you know those fields have still
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:51.880]  not been and guess who controls that today al gore mr anti oil occidental petroleum mr carbon
[1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:56.680]  tax man you know he was one of the biggest oil men in the world now now let's expand on this
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:02.360]  exactly big oil is actually what's financing the carbon tax to shut down coal their competition
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:08.040]  which would make energy cheap again right right exactly and then all they talk about is nuclear
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:13.880]  power it's so safe and efficient that which is another insider deal that's horrible and we're
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:19.400]  about to kill ourselves the pacific is getting irradiated they're telling you don't eat fish 91
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:24.600]  percent of reactors are leaking worldwide but i mean let's get into that talk about hydrogen alone
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:32.040]  yeah get into solutions hydrogen is the way to go uh i met a fellow here just the other day uh who
[1:13:32.040 --> 1:13:41.240]  uh had been an engineer and he lives in new jersey out in the kind of the countryside and he uh his he
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:50.040]  runs his cars his air conditioning his home his heating his lawnmower on hydrogen all right and
[1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:56.600]  when hurricane sandy hit and all of his neighbors their power went out for like a month or more
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:14:01.480]  and they were in desperate need can you imagine no power for a month or a month and a half and
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:04.840]  that's not off record you were hanging out with the crows right they're they're they're researching
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:12.120]  this right yeah and uh and he was telling it was a great story because all his neighbors he was a
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:16.520]  bright light so to speak in the middle of the darkness because his lights were on everything
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:23.720]  was operating and his neighbors would come to his house and to take a shower and to uh and to juice
[1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:29.080]  up their batteries for them and this is on record so the most plentiful free element uh you know
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:35.480]  out there is hydrogen uh this this this this gas explain to people how this works well you can take
[1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:41.240]  a and here's what's amazing about hydrogen and why i don't understand well i do because they're
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:47.160]  greedy bastards but i mean the i don't understand why we're not shifting to a hydrogen economy
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:53.800]  because as i understand it you can take all of the normal infrastructure the pipelines the pumping
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:15:00.040]  stations the refineries the your car you get a yeah they're even gonna make the money off of
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:04.040]  them but they still don't want us to have exactly and we were the top engineer last time he can
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:09.160]  agree with you on this with a little tweaking it could all run on hydrogen hello there you go the
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:14.120]  but why not why don't we not getting that because it's the most plentiful substance in the world
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:20.200]  and they cannot get a monopoly over it well that's like diamonds are really semi precious but they're
[1:15:20.200 --> 1:15:25.160]  geographically uh restricted so they can create artificial scarcity again right and they have
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:30.680]  tight control over that the fastest way to get killed in africa is to go out and find a diamond
[1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:35.720]  you know outside of the normal uh yeah they call those blood diamonds and demonize anybody trying
[1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:40.120]  to get money for africa when really it's the so i want to come back with more solutions
[1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:44.760]  other alternative energy things and talk about like you did yesterday the you know the the machines
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:49.480]  you saw all you do is put water into this thing and then it separates it all out and and just
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:55.080]  incredible it's as close as a perpetual motion machine as you can get jim mars is our guest

[1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:20.200]  and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory state education to the
[1:16:20.200 --> 1:16:26.360]  hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our
[1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:31.160]  actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:35.720]  and verifying it they can take total control of your awareness all of this is happening so fast
[1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:41.160]  you need to be ahead of the game how to engineer the opinion of the american people so that they
[1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:48.200]  would not only endorse but demand a war another one another plane to stay state of mind because

[1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:49.080]  ever do this on the sunday show i do on the weekday show quite often to go into overdrive
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:54.680]  which will be on the internet streams the video streams at info wars dot com forward slash show
[1:20:54.680 --> 1:21:00.840]  only at the end of this broadcast in t minus 40 minutes to extend the broadcast we'll see what
[1:21:00.840 --> 1:21:07.320]  happens jim you are just going a mile a minute off air about as an investigator as a journalist all
[1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:11.880]  of these alter alternate energies and again we were having dinner last night with a very well
[1:21:11.880 --> 1:21:16.760]  known engineer who's worked in the apollo program but after that in petroleum engineering
[1:21:16.760 --> 1:21:22.280]  you name it he's done it and he was absolutely and the fact that they knew 30 years ago they
[1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:29.160]  could have the streets be solar glass and power everything off that i mean they are just like
[1:21:29.160 --> 1:21:33.240]  they had light bulbs famous light bulbs in san francisco but there's one in dallas too or is it
[1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:36.840]  i remember hearing about when i was kid at the fire station that was like 80 years old now it must
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:43.080]  be a hundred there was one at the palace theater that was burning until they finally tore it down
[1:21:43.080 --> 1:21:50.440]  uh had been burning since 18 uh yeah so so light bulbs that go for a hundred years why do they
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:55.560]  burn out fast now it's planned obsolescence that's admitted the public doesn't know that
[1:21:55.560 --> 1:22:02.440]  everything's game so so so get into it solar all of it uh well it's all mindset uh there is no
[1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:08.360]  problem with technology i'm here to tell you just with absolutely no fear of contradiction
[1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:14.840]  that uh there is off the shelf technology that can solve all of our energy problems overnight
[1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:22.600]  it's not so it's not technology it's the middle thing now here's a classic example about 30 years
[1:22:22.600 --> 1:22:29.720]  ago i was in interviewing an energy expert and i'd gotten real fired up on solar energy and i said
[1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:35.480]  well you know what about solar energy you know we can draw energy from the sun if sun burns out
[1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:41.240]  we're all in trouble anyway and he goes well that's really a good idea he says but but that's 20 years
[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:47.880]  in the future okay hey folks it's 20 years here we are and we still don't have it why because listen
[1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:53.160]  here is the problem in their thinking and their training and their conditioning he said do you
[1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:59.000]  realize it would take solar panels covering the entire state of arizona to provide enough electricity
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:05.320]  to power the city of los angeles and i went oh whoa yeah i guess so well i went off and i
[1:23:05.320 --> 1:23:11.240]  thought about that and you know he's right but where's the flaw in his thinking central generation
[1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:18.360]  he's can only think in terms of generating enough electricity centrally and then piping it to la
[1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:22.760]  where you lose most of it yeah and you lose most of it in the transmission same thing with the uh
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:27.880]  with with wind farms far away it works to have it at your house right like the old windmill but
[1:23:27.880 --> 1:23:35.240]  but not 500 miles away so well so what if everybody in los angeles put solar panels on their roof
[1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:40.200]  whoa then you power the city of los angeles and everybody's got their own power and why don't we
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:45.080]  have that because they hadn't figured out how to make a cloud come and hang over your house if you
[1:23:45.080 --> 1:23:50.840]  don't pay your electric bill absolutely well it's also come out in the news that if you try to hook
[1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:55.480]  it up on your house yourself off the grid they won't come inspect it they won't authorize in
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:24:01.480]  most cities but if you but they'll subsidize it and pay for part of it with taxpayer money if you
[1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:06.840]  hook it up and let them run it and it feeds the grid right well now that's the interesting thing too
[1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:11.960]  and i've lived through illness and watched it happen when it first came out about people uh
[1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:16.840]  whether it's solar wind generation whatever providing their own juice the power companies
[1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:22.760]  were all opposed to it okay and but then it came in anyway and then they passed laws saying if you
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:29.160]  are producing individually uh enough juice that you can put it back into the power system
[1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:34.920]  they have to buy it back from you okay now you'd think oh wait a minute sounds good but it means
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:39.160]  you get an inspection now they're running you well number one they can come on your property
[1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:44.760]  they can't inspect you but here's the thing now they're all for it because under the law
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:49.800]  yes they have to buy back your excess electricity but they get to buy it back at a cheaper price
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:56.360]  than what they're paying normally and then some people exactly exactly so it's creating monopoly
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:02.200]  form again of a lower price but they're making money on it so it's okay exactly but the people
[1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:06.520]  say well aren't you for obama then he's giving tens of billions of taxpayer money a year to this
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:12.360]  so did spain it bankrupted him it's given to select insiders he did his buddies and they went broke
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:17.560]  they don't even open a building up they just take the money and run exactly or they build
[1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:22.200]  windmills 500 miles away on record that break and don't even work and kill the birds and that's
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:27.560]  cause chances are if you looked way into their portfolio you'd find that actually they're
[1:25:27.560 --> 1:25:32.120]  heavily invested in oil and gas well no it turns out you're right you know again BP is the biggest
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:36.200]  funder of all this and the biggest funder of carbon taxes right they're the group that gives
[1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:41.400]  most the money to fund Bilderberg as a charity look it up okay you mentioned BP is running the
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:47.480]  clean energy movement so they can kill it exactly and I just ran into some wonderful folks from
[1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:55.080]  california who had been getting some help quote help from shell to develop hydrogen all right and
[1:25:55.080 --> 1:26:00.920]  then it that finally they finally realized that they weren't getting anywhere shell that's dutch
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:07.320]  oil that's queen uh Beatrix Beatrix so holland they don't want they don't want that it's a public
[1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:12.600]  relations move she owns that company and they they weren't doing it in fact and if anything they were
[1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:17.880]  throwing uh you know roadblock they are not just that company but on record they the federal
[1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:22.200]  regulators are sustained in europe will go to anybody and go you got a nice company here what's
[1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:27.640]  worth 10 million dollars here's here's 500 million signed over to us and they shut it down and then
[1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:34.120]  say look we're green yeah exactly well do we have that obama clip real quick we're gonna we're gonna
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:39.240]  play this clip because again he's telling africans you can't have progress unless we have clean energy
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:45.480]  meanwhile he's blocking it all while claiming he funds it all this is the incredible brainwashing
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:50.680]  here's the club youth that everybody's mentioned here in africa if everybody's raising living
[1:26:50.680 --> 1:26:55.000]  standards to the point where everybody's got a car and everybody's got air conditioning and
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:02.440]  everybody's got a big house uh well the planet will boil over unless we find new ways of producing
[1:27:02.440 --> 1:27:11.560]  energy now now expanding on that white house dot gov club the problem is warming happens in all the
[1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:16.120]  major studies they had to admit this now and then carbon dioxide goes up and now nasa admits it's a
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:23.080]  cooling gas and it's a trace gas so it's a total red herring give up you'll let us run the energy
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:28.360]  system and decide what you can have or it'll burn the earth up right well well what they claim is
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:33.880]  is that it's the carbon emissions that are causing greenhouse effect and then heating up the the
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:40.200]  planet okay so well if we go to hydrogen it doesn't heat up if it puts out any excess at all it's
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:45.960]  oxygen and and uh you know clear water which is something we need yeah and how horrible by the way
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:54.040]  listen people listen carefully to this it is not global warming it is solar system warming
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:59.880]  the ice caps on mars are diminishing which means they're melting the ice uh uh the un voted and
[1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:04.920]  said the sun doesn't affect temperature uh yeah but the ice on some of the moons of jibbiter are
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:09.480]  as melting but i'm being sarcastic they voted and said the sun doesn't affect us the sun is everything
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:14.440]  well they used to tell us the world was flat but i mean how dumb do they think we are the sun is the
[1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:20.360]  main driver of climate well they think we're pretty dumb if all we do is watch mainstream media i agree
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:23.880]  and now now let me throw this out and we're gonna go break come back with calls here and then into
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:28.840]  overdrive probably we're sitting here looking at this i mean i just want to point out that they
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:33.720]  claim they're the ones trying to save the earth they're the ones that are damaging absolutely the
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:39.160]  genetic engineering i mean look at that well you're looking in the dictionary under hypocrisy
[1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:45.080]  and you find government officials i mean there it is they they uh they're in the pocket of the
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:49.160]  vested interest which means the all come we're going to take questions but you were the long

[1:34:23.640 --> 1:34:29.560]  to repeat what you were saying off air about 30 minutes ago when i was talking about the police
[1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:34.600]  going wild and you know commandeering half of boston and treating everybody like terrorists and now
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:38.440]  somebody shot fireworks off we're gonna lock down a neighborhood and search your houses without
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:44.600]  warrants and ask a cop a question they taser you or the imperiousness and how the government
[1:34:44.600 --> 1:34:50.200]  with its ran corporation domestic stabilization force has really federalized police i mean you
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:56.280]  worked for a long time you knew jack ruby i mean you've been working since the early 60s as a crime
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:01.880]  reporter uh in dallas fort worth of the fort worth our telegram give me your take on this
[1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:08.200]  transformation of our police well unfortunately yes you're right there is a huge transformation
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:15.560]  back in the day back in the early 60s when i started uh i was the police reporter i
[1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:20.840]  office in the police station right across from the dispatch room uh had all these monitors
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:24.760]  you know every time a call come in i'd hear it and i had a little mobile talk about transparency
[1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:29.320]  they'd never do that today no a reporter in the heart of the police station right there and i'd go
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:34.200]  hang out in the dispatch room and talk to the dispatchers i knew them all they all knew me
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:39.480]  i'd go hang out with the detectives and in the morning we'd all go get coffee and and several
[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:44.200]  times we'd be having coffee in the morning and they get a call and we've got a homicide because
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:49.480]  let's face it you know morning that's when you find the bodies right yeah so boom and i just run
[1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:54.200]  with them had a little snappy brim hat and a trench coat and i just go with them had a pad and a
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:59.400]  pencil line go walk right on in into the crime scene step over the blood and the mud and the
[1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:03.800]  bodies and everything else and just sit there make my little notes and and write down what
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:09.080]  because we were a free country more than i mean this is the old republic you exactly you didn't
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:13.880]  cover up here's what happened and it's an evolutionary thing it wasn't anybody's fault
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:20.040]  but before long all of a sudden the radio stations decided they wanted to get in on spot news so they
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:24.600]  started carrying a little portable tape recorders so now you got three or four five reporters from
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:29.720]  radio stations with recorders they want in all right well then the next thing you know the tv
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:34.360]  stations they were getting either and now they want to make something up to get a story now there's
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:38.920]  an adversarial relationship and the globalists have played off that just they wanted to be there
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:44.360]  okay and then the tv started getting little cameras they could carry either eight millimeter
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:50.760]  one uh 16 millimeter wind-ups or video the small videos but then they had to have a light guy and
[1:36:50.760 --> 1:36:56.040]  a sound guy and first thing you know you had two dozen people well you can't keep out one reporter
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:37:01.720]  and let them know the one in that's not fair so they started keeping everybody out but then you
[1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:06.680]  have to stand outside the house or the business or whatever wait for the police spokesman to come
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:12.920]  out and tell you what happened well now it's now they've got that damn yellow tape and they block
[1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:21.080]  off blocks at a time and secrecy breeds corruption exactly now now eight times out of ten they are
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:25.720]  coming just tell you oh it's a bar room shooting it's a domestic quarrel whatever you get the story
[1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:30.440]  no big deal but if there's a little bit of a politics to it or if there's something a little
[1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:35.080]  flaky or the feds are involved then how do we know that we're getting the straight story like
[1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:39.640]  michael hastings car blowing up or gary webb getting shot lies in the head and it got more and more
[1:37:39.640 --> 1:37:46.040]  corrupt okay now with no more scrutiny with nobody looking over their shoulder then that's where the
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:51.880]  corruption comes in because then they can pull uh sneakies they can fake reports they can plant
[1:37:51.880 --> 1:37:57.000]  evidence they can do all kinds of things and i'm not saying they do this all the time i still have
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:03.560]  the highest regard for police officers because that's a tough job it is a tough job and i honor them
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:07.880]  for doing that but like any other job like any other group of people you're not about the law
[1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:12.920]  you've got a you've got a small percentage that are just cowboys okay they're there to
[1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:18.520]  to be arrogant they're there to push their weight around uh for example if you get stopped by a cop
[1:38:18.520 --> 1:38:23.160]  how many times if anybody listening to my voice how many times have you ever gotten stopped and
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:29.480]  the cop says oh wait i'm sorry i think i've got the wrong car or oh i'm sorry i made a mistake here
[1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:35.720]  never never they cannot do that they've got to exert the exert their authority and now it's
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:39.800]  getting worse and worse because now they're all under homeland security and there's some well
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:45.240]  that's the issue is now they're secret agents yeah now they're in top secret operations well now
[1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:50.440]  it's security security and hey listen i watched two movies with my wife last week one was called
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:54.760]  numbers another was something else but the point is it's like now the cia comes and kills the bad
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:59.000]  guy and goes ahead and shoots their family just because they saw and the movie ends and that's
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:04.680]  good i mean they're just selling torture secret arrest what who's going to protect us from a
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:11.960]  government i'm surprised the government isn't more corrupt that since 1947 gem we have had a government
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:18.440]  that can operate in total secrecy under national security no wonder it's so bad well let me put
[1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:22.840]  this way let here's something for people to think about every time we hear about some foreign
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:29.480]  foreign adventurism some military operations somewhere some near undeclared war who's behind it
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:35.640]  the national security council well the national security council said it was okay they authorized
[1:39:35.640 --> 1:39:39.560]  by the way they've gotten presidents to transfer them more power than the president in congress
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:46.440]  okay now wait can you tell me who exactly is the national security council i do know
[1:39:46.440 --> 1:39:50.120]  it's people like general jones and folks for the general public doesn't know that okay what they
[1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:56.120]  don't know is is that they bring in people as they need them but the basic national security council
[1:39:56.120 --> 1:40:02.920]  is only four people yep the president the vice president secretary of defense and state now wait
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:08.360]  a minute three of those are appointed by the president so when we allowed them to set up this
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:13.240]  national security system look at obama doing every once with obama care and the news is like
[1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:20.840]  roll call today goes is that dictatorial well it's a dictatorship well the one person the president
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:27.400]  picks the national security council which approves everything having to do with our fighting and
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:34.520]  that's a dictatorship right it's one guy one guy and now they want to bring 50 000 veterans of syria
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:38.280]  who are mainly al-qaeda here to america and you know they're not going to get searched they're

[1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:50.280]  to phone calls but again you were bringing up a lot of issues during the break you were saying
[1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:56.200]  something about nazi germany which you've written best-selling books on paralleling america oh
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:48:02.840]  absolutely i know the only point i was going to make is that uh uh the nazis at the height of their
[1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:11.400]  power and arrogance uh middle of world war two uh they did not and i'm sure never even contemplated
[1:48:11.400 --> 1:48:17.000]  stopping germans on the street or at a public place and saying we're going to grope your genitals
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:23.240]  and we're going to put our hands in your pants and uh like the tsa yeah well you know that because
[1:48:23.240 --> 1:48:27.480]  they drag your kids away and then go get back and then grab them and some weird guy with
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:31.720]  gree stripping officer does it why didn't they do that to those germans because those germans
[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:38.040]  at that time would never have put up with that but we do nobody puts up with what americans put up
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:43.560]  with i know and it's sad for me they laugh at us israel probably more than a security conscious
[1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:46.840]  countries the whole world they don't do that they don't touch no they're actually profile
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:52.280]  i know it's incredible oh one other thing too about the police the changes that i noticed
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:58.680]  when i started back in 60s working for police if for some reason the fbi showed up they came
[1:48:58.680 --> 1:49:04.200]  with their hat in their hand uh would would you like us to help you we'd be glad to give you some
[1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:10.280]  help if you'd like and of course the local police man oh jay or whoever the fbi holy cow yeah please
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:15.800]  you know help us now cops roll over like a dog pee on themselves all it all happened on my watch
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:21.880]  just just over the period of about 10 years there uh it went from hey can we help you to uh
[1:49:21.880 --> 1:49:27.160]  well we're here to help to get out of the way we're with the federal government to roll out a red
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:32.360]  carpet and kiss my patoot yeah i mean you can have a dog rolls over and like you know yeah and that's
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:37.880]  that yeah so i think my message is to all the police officers out there and deputy sheriffs and
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:45.400]  law enforcement people listen you do not have to cave in to the fbi and the yeah stop groveling
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:50.360]  why don't we even have states exactly they are run by corrupt people you're the people that's
[1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:55.720]  supposed to be protecting the public okay yeah the federal government is has been totally taken
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:50:02.440]  over by global well serve and protect the people protect us from them okay jim marz is our guest
[1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:06.280]  we got to go to calls right now let's talk to curtis in tennessee you're on the air go ahead
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:13.560]  yeah hello alec the smart uh alec i need information or i got two things to ask uh
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:18.120]  information about the smart meter you had a lady on the show about three or four weeks ago that they
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:25.080]  got the video on smart meeting in small town texas yes sir transportation city council and the lady
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:31.640]  here in Memphis and i try to get a whole ton later talk to her there give her a trick here at the
[1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:36.600]  edge take a peek right here because they might get in here well let me tell you this uh i forget
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:40.760]  the name of the lady in texas that's gotten it kicked out in like 30 counties last time i checked
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:46.280]  new york times reported it uh guys can type in for me something like texas woman defeats smart
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:53.640]  meters but the big issue is is even the washington post and ap just last week reported that the
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:58.760]  smart meters are going to control your refrigerator your whole house so that's on record so it's not
[1:50:58.760 --> 1:51:05.800]  just what we're doing here in texas these smart meters are loaded up with other spy tech that
[1:51:05.800 --> 1:51:10.920]  basically jack into everything in your house and then surveil you and that's not alex jones saying
[1:51:10.920 --> 1:51:16.680]  that that's general portray as former head of the cia last year at a wired magazine conference
[1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:22.600]  bragged and said quote your dishwasher is washing and listening to you that's the wired magazine
[1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:29.080]  headline jim yeah well uh is i understand it with these smart meters uh under the old meters that
[1:51:29.080 --> 1:51:34.120]  when you turn something on then the meter starts because you use electricity under the smart meters
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:38.840]  they kind of keep a certain level going so the bottom line yeah that's a whole other area it's
[1:51:38.840 --> 1:51:44.440]  been proven all over the news that they double and triple bills they rip you off with these it's
[1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:50.840]  smart all right smart at raping you that's right your electric bill is going to go up period plus
[1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:56.360]  their and don't believe us watch it happen yeah go study it for you so absolutely i'm glad you
[1:51:56.360 --> 1:52:00.520]  brought up that angle they they're screwing in so many different ways that i didn't even remember
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:04.600]  that it's been the news that's happening yeah i mean you're talking one month after it went in
[1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:09.480]  in a case in chicago in a whole neighborhood doubling of prices yeah and then people did stuff
[1:52:09.480 --> 1:52:14.520]  like unplug it from the house and go on a vacation and they still got bills well see this is what i
[1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:19.720]  don't understand you got the obama administration that's pushing all this stuff like smart meters
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:26.200]  and yet and what it's doing is it's screwing his own uh constituent well look at obama care
[1:52:26.200 --> 1:52:30.280]  he's supposed to be there it doubles rates doesn't cover it written by the insurance
[1:52:30.280 --> 1:52:35.000]  companies i know i don't understand and yet there's so many people still supporting him
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:40.200]  and and yet they can't hey seem that obama cares a huge tax on the poorest people
[1:52:40.200 --> 1:52:44.920]  i know he's hurting he increased taxes on people making twenty thousand dollars a year
[1:52:44.920 --> 1:52:50.520]  in this new tax increase that's a fact that's right now if you're making twenty thousand or less
[1:52:50.520 --> 1:52:56.520]  you really can't afford a tax increase now any any few but it's okay because he's he's he's he's
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:53:01.320]  liberal i mean it's i know hey they vote they're all mad the hubbing and post that bush is getting
[1:53:01.320 --> 1:53:06.360]  a humanitarian award from a university i mean why not give him a peace prize too why not give
[1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:12.120]  obama a hundred well here's what i don't understand they gave obama a nobel peace prize because he
[1:53:12.760 --> 1:53:19.240]  wanted peace and thought about peace and done anything hitler wanted peace so wait wait i want
[1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:24.120]  peace how come i can't get a nobel peace well i think i think bush deserves one and i think i
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:31.160]  think hitler does give him one stalling that's right hitler gingus con hitler wanted peace
[1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:36.360]  he wanted a piece of checklist fuck you wanted a piece of info palpatine wanted one thank you
[1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:40.360]  caller hope that answer your question let's go to andrew and pencil vanya you're on the air
[1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:49.400]  hello yes extremist oh hi my phone just buzzed for a moment but okay uh jim my question for you is
[1:53:49.400 --> 1:53:54.760]  do you agree with me that every so often on his show alex should expose the highly significant
[1:53:54.760 --> 1:53:59.640]  in your face obvious fact that the moon is a giant artificial body which you exposed in the first
[1:53:59.640 --> 1:54:04.360]  chapter of your book alien agenda no i agree with the i actually think it's uh hillary clinton's butt
[1:54:04.360 --> 1:54:12.920]  up there i'm sorry well uh i'm not quite prepared to say this is a totally artificial body but there
[1:54:12.920 --> 1:54:19.400]  are many many many strange aspects to our moon that we don't really even understand none the least
[1:54:19.400 --> 1:54:24.360]  of which is how it got where it is uh perfectly placed for the earth to have its atmosphere yeah
[1:54:24.360 --> 1:54:31.960]  even isaac asimov a famous scientist and writer i said the moon should not be where it is but it is
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:37.720]  and so anyway that kind of lays out a real dichotomy in our thinking because as we all know
[1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:43.800]  there's no such thing as aliens let me tell the caller and or something look i'm a reptoid 18
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:49.800]  billion years old i run the moon i'm actually the galactic commander stop trying to look like
[1:54:49.800 --> 1:54:55.320]  an obama deserves a hundred peace prizes he should have for breakfast little peace prizes
[1:54:55.320 --> 1:55:00.600]  just thousands of them i mean he should be massaged with peace prizes made out in chocolate
[1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:06.360]  absolutely or whatever you want strawberries thank you caller you extremist let's go to christ
[1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:12.600]  in florida hello chris do you nominate obama for 10 000 peace prizes there's an inflation in them
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:17.800]  now the more people he kills the more al-qaeda he funds the more every drop of blood when al-qaeda
[1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:24.280]  chops the kids head off in syria or in egypt every gout of blood he gets thousands of peace prizes
[1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:31.320]  go ahead caller absolutely inflation sucks all of us dry no thank you very much alex for taking
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:37.400]  my call uh jim marr is wonderful that you're on and alex you just do it all right man you tell the
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:43.480]  truth i'm so glad i had you listen to mainstream media just misses the mark so far it's incredible
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:52.040]  but my question for jim jim okay i am working in the alternative energy research market how
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:57.880]  does that market how does my company get funded we need a chunk of change well you make it well
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:02.840]  let me tell you how you do it you make a contribution to the crime syndicate of the chicago mafia or
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:08.520]  obama and then they're saying for a 10 000 donation you get a million back no no no let me tell you
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:13.480]  what i can't really tell you what to do because going out and trying to find funding that's
[1:56:13.480 --> 1:56:18.840]  everybody's looking for that here's but i can tell you two things not to do okay number one
[1:56:18.840 --> 1:56:26.040]  your first inclination is if you come up with a valid uh alternative energy uh device is to run
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:31.560]  get it patented okay don't do it because when you give it to the patent office you're giving it to
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:37.000]  the government the government if they see that it'll actually work they'll put it under national
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:42.760]  security wrap it up you'll never see it again two don't let the big companies buy it up they're
[1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:47.480]  going to say well what a wonderful that's right build it open source it give it to everybody
[1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:53.800]  that's right in fact i know this sounds counterintuitive but it's true put it out on the internet
[1:56:53.800 --> 1:56:59.240]  and then you'll be the consultant who can then help everybody set it up exactly because most people
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:04.360]  like right now most people know how to make beer most people can grow tobacco but they don't they're
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:09.000]  go by it okay so if you come up with the device put it all out there i gotta let the caller go
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:13.400]  we're gonna start overdrive internet only info wars.com forward slash show briefly mars tell
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:18.280]  folks about these devices you've seen the specific generators all you put in is water and it runs your
[1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:24.760]  house right well i know where one's in existence i've seen them operate uh it's called a hydrogen
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:31.480]  generator it's about the size of a coffee can runs off of hydrogen oxygen uh okay so theoretically
[1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:37.000]  what you do is you just take some water any old water lake water ditch water you run it across
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:42.920]  electrolyzing plate you separate the hydrogen the oxygen you burn that in the firing chamber with a

[2:00:17.480 --> 2:00:25.320]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:32.680]  i think in the six seven year history of this sunday broadcast
[2:00:33.400 --> 2:00:36.840]  been on there 18 years been doing the sunday show for about six seven years
[2:00:36.840 --> 2:00:41.000]  i'll look up that date to get the actual numbers but it's around that this is like the second or
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:48.440]  third time we've gone into overdrive so jim mars is with us i got brad man bear pig mark sonneeb
[2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:54.680]  i'm pronouncing that right jesse michael and clone and that's it for calls with jim mars we're
[2:00:54.680 --> 2:01:00.120]  gonna go to you in a moment but you were getting into how these hydrogen generators work start back
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:05.800]  over and then get into your friend they basically killed arkans sided with that yeah yeah well he
[2:01:05.800 --> 2:01:11.480]  he got the idea for this thing and then built it and it actually worked i've seen it work
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:18.600]  and but it got people would take off and big companies tried to come and buy it up he wouldn't
[2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:24.200]  sell to them and this thing basically could produce superheated steam which could then
[2:01:24.200 --> 2:01:29.640]  turn a turbine produce all the electricity you want and then when the steam condensed you had
[2:01:29.640 --> 2:01:35.480]  audible water okay clear water so it not only was a water purifier but an energy generator
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:40.760]  and it's about the size of a coffee can and i've seen it work it works okay uh and then but the
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:45.480]  next thing you know we were off of a visiting in china and when we got back we found out that he
[2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:51.320]  had been found in his car uh up in dentin county and a hose running to the tailpipe and they ruled
[2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:57.400]  it a suicide and yet i doubt my wife and i and all the friends everybody knew him nobody believes
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:03.160]  that but how can you prove anything well listen i know people that have developed uh products
[2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:08.920]  that have made hundreds of millions of dollars in medical devices and medical treatments and drugs
[2:02:08.920 --> 2:02:14.360]  and salves and things like that and they say government's point blank this is a disruptive
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:19.800]  technology if it doesn't play ball with the big boys they don't allow it right or the big boys
[2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:25.880]  will buy it and just warehouse it right i guess the analogy or the parable or the allegory would
[2:02:25.880 --> 2:02:31.880]  be at the end of raiders the law stark that warehouse just full of all those boxes of other
[2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:36.840]  secret things all right here's another one when i was working for the newspaper i covered this story
[2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:42.360]  where western electric which is the r&d facility for bell electric bell telephone at the time
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:47.480]  had developed again a little coffee can type device that was a solar collector generator
[2:02:47.480 --> 2:02:52.840]  and uh you know uh every time your phone rings it uses just a little the old telephones it took
[2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:58.600]  a little bit of juice to ring the bell right so but over a year and with all the telephones that
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:03.240]  was millions of dollars in electricity uh that it was costing the phone company so they came up with
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:07.800]  this little solar collector generator and they were going to put it on the pole telephone poles
[2:03:07.800 --> 2:03:12.520]  of all the neighborhood and they collect a little bit of sunlight energy hold it and then ring the
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:18.680]  telephones it was going to save a millions okay well the problem is just as they got ready to patent
[2:03:18.680 --> 2:03:22.840]  it somebody realized now wait a minute if we put this out somebody's going to get hold of one they'll
[2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:27.400]  take it apart they'll figure out how to make a solar collector generator they'll make a bigger
[2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:32.440]  one they run their house and have their own independent electricity so they shelled it
[2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:38.120]  put it back or closed it last last night the video's up at info wars.com Raymond Teague who
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:43.000]  was the one of the head uh Apollo engineers you know he's on the tv shows the photos he's there
[2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:49.160]  he's had a lot off record we can't repeat why do they tell me this stuff unfortunately
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:53.320]  unfortunately but as journalists we wear those hats we can't i'm mainly a commentator but i
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:57.720]  wear the journalist hat so i never tell never kiss and tell learn that with the cheerleaders very
[2:03:57.720 --> 2:04:04.680]  quickly when i was about 15 but uh but the point is is that i never kiss and tell but what he did
[2:04:04.680 --> 2:04:11.320]  tell us is on record about when he was working at rca in between the Apollo program skylab and he
[2:04:11.320 --> 2:04:18.040]  went on to the shuttle program what they admitted tell folks about that oh well they you know they
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:23.240]  they they've had anti-gravity and he saw one they'd put out in the company newsletter as i
[2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:27.320]  recall and yeah show the guy floating around on it the engineer they said yeah yeah we've developed
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:32.600]  anti-gravity and uh oh i you've got that clip right aren't you gonna show that well it's up on
[2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:37.560]  the side but the point is it's just wild Raymond's a real guy right and he's telling us this and this
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:45.240]  isn't just one story from one guy out of there uh in in my book uh the uh rise of fourth rick i believe
[2:04:45.240 --> 2:04:50.680]  i detailed how that right after world war two there was a series of articles by William lear the
[2:04:50.680 --> 2:04:55.800]  guy invented the lear jet and by several other very reputable people and they were all talking
[2:04:55.800 --> 2:05:01.400]  about anti-gravity and that was the next thing and it was gonna be you know and then it all went
[2:05:01.400 --> 2:05:07.240]  dark that was the end of that and today they have got it so suppressed that if you go talk to a
[2:05:07.240 --> 2:05:12.120]  aeronautical engineer and start talking about anti-gravity he'll laugh at you and and run out
[2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:16.360]  of the room because they say it doesn't exist back in the late 80s they had it they did the
[2:05:16.360 --> 2:05:22.200]  Hans and Fleischman or whatever it was zero point energy oh it was a mayonnaise jar turned out that
[2:05:22.200 --> 2:05:26.920]  test actually worked now it wasn't really very feasible to transfer the power and it didn't
[2:05:26.920 --> 2:05:30.840]  create a lot of power but the point is it was a real test hundreds of universities have now
[2:05:30.840 --> 2:05:35.960]  done similar things and proven it right but since that hoax happened or they claimed it was a hoax
[2:05:35.960 --> 2:05:42.040]  no coverage right no coverage now briefly then i'm going to these calls i promise callers get
[2:05:42.040 --> 2:05:48.840]  into deals for those that don't know it's been declassified that they made a deal for most of
[2:05:48.840 --> 2:05:55.240]  the iraqi military to stand out in 1991 they made a deal in 2003 for over 90 percent to stand
[2:05:55.240 --> 2:06:00.360]  down they were trained here in the us that's on record sedamos cia that's declassified for those
[2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:06.360]  that don't know he'd gone rogue so he was definitely an adversary but that's how infiltrated it was
[2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:12.120]  was the germans were able to take france in two weeks because again the majority of their general
[2:06:12.120 --> 2:06:17.720]  staff stood down to become the new dictators the vici french they moved from paris to vici to run
[2:06:17.720 --> 2:06:24.600]  the whole country that's why they stood down it's the same thing deals are made now what is your
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:30.840]  evidence of the whole nazi system going underground or making a deal with the west and and the whole
[2:06:30.840 --> 2:06:37.160]  rat line paperclip how deep does that go that goes way way deep i'm gonna have to make this short
[2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:41.800]  and brief but you're gonna have to do your own homework but read my book the rise of the fourth
[2:06:41.800 --> 2:06:47.320]  right basically the story is this we know the germans were working on atomic bomb but the
[2:06:47.880 --> 2:06:53.480]  official history says oh well they weren't able to make one but yes they were they may have even
[2:06:53.480 --> 2:06:59.080]  set off some tactical nukes on the eastern front but stalin couldn't admit to that because he was
[2:06:59.080 --> 2:07:04.520]  having problems enough keeping his people in the war anyway all right so germany had the atomic bomb
[2:07:04.520 --> 2:07:10.120]  whoops they did how come they didn't use one okay very simple because by the time they had one that
[2:07:10.120 --> 2:07:15.320]  was operational and that they could use it was towards the end the the russians were closing
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:20.760]  in from the east the allies were closing in from the west uh and the key thing a couple of key
[2:07:20.760 --> 2:07:27.000]  things they did not have a reliable delivery system they had a three stage rocket called the new york
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:32.360]  rocket if that'll tell you what their plan was uh but it was unreliable they didn't have a guidance
[2:07:32.360 --> 2:07:37.960]  system that was that adequate they had a huge base in norway with these six engine bombers
[2:07:37.960 --> 2:07:43.000]  and they were waiting to go on the new york mission which they then put in captain america the first
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:48.680]  episode yeah with the red skull see they they take real stuff and then make it a movie and make it a
[2:07:48.680 --> 2:07:53.560]  movie so that if it comes up people go oh well you just saw that in the movie but anyway all right i
[2:07:53.560 --> 2:07:59.880]  have you wrote about this before that came out oh yeah and i have a copy of the 1942 lufo alpha
[2:07:59.880 --> 2:08:06.040]  a blast study of an atomic bomb on manhattan island that's what they were doing so why didn't they do
[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:12.040]  it okay simple the war was almost over we were closing in if they had set off a nuclear weapon
[2:08:12.040 --> 2:08:18.120]  in london or paris or new york we would have devastated germany we would have left no stone
[2:08:18.120 --> 2:08:23.400]  unturned that would have been the end of that so what'd they do they got to the elitists they got to
[2:08:23.400 --> 2:08:29.720]  the john j mcloy's and to the allen and john foster dullis's and to the rockefellas and to the
[2:08:29.720 --> 2:08:35.800]  rothschilds and they said okay we're going to swap you our nuclear technology uh in exchange for
[2:08:35.800 --> 2:08:42.040]  immunity and that's when we set up operation paper clip and we allowed thousands of unreconstructed
[2:08:42.040 --> 2:08:46.200]  nazis to come into the united states and we rolled them into our military and that's why
[2:08:46.200 --> 2:08:51.560]  oppenheimer said the bombs dropped on hereshima and nakasaki on record were of german providence
[2:08:51.560 --> 2:08:57.800]  exactly exactly in fact we only had enough uranium for one bomb and we set that off at
[2:08:57.800 --> 2:09:02.440]  all the margardo just to make sure it worked and then just a few weeks to make sure the nazis
[2:09:02.440 --> 2:09:08.280]  weren't bs-ing yes and then just a few weeks later though we had two to drop on hereshima
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:12.760]  and nakasaki where'd they come from they came from the germans the germans you both uh-huh
[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:20.360]  the u-235 okay uh it's oh it's crazy as most of that's declassified yes it's that's what's
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:24.840]  frustrating as people are watching this thinking we're just saying this it's like you know there
[2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:29.480]  was a whole there was a whole really pretty good little documentary on uh on the military
[2:09:29.480 --> 2:09:34.680]  channel i believe it was about the u-235 and the fact that they were shipping the uh a measure
[2:09:34.680 --> 2:09:41.400]  smith jet and some uh 50 barrels a gold lined barrels of uranium that was enriched uranium
[2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:48.520]  because you don't need gold line if it's not enriched all right so it's all a deal it's always
[2:09:48.520 --> 2:09:54.280]  a deal uh and uh that's how we got uh that's how we got our nuclear capability so just like the
[2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:59.720]  french made a deal to capitulate to the nazis before it started the west took them in and they
[2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:05.560]  were put over the rocketry programs over the cia they were like the golden boys well let's not forget
[2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:12.040]  that prior to the war there uh there was a the america was largely isolationism in fact there was
[2:10:12.040 --> 2:10:19.160]  a huge pro german faction in the bund and the bund you know charles linberg uh a lot of people
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:25.560]  were very supportive at joe kennedy uh they were all supportive of knots of my grandfather
[2:10:25.560 --> 2:10:32.680]  remembered dallas radio stations were like pro boond exactly but see we tend to forget that because
[2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:39.960]  um the history is written by them victors it's incredible i mean it is so amazing let's go
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:47.080]  to phone calls brad in utah you're on the air go ahead all thanks uh i'm glad to join you
[2:10:47.080 --> 2:10:54.040]  jim martyrs and alex jones i pray for you every day alex you the family uh thanks for exposing
[2:10:54.040 --> 2:10:59.000]  everything you have today the middle east breakdown the muslim brother hudel kaita uh free thank you
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:05.880]  brother alternate energy uh the police state uh i'm from waco originally so uh need i say more
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:12.840]  about the police state i had a attorney that uh actually quit practicing law uh handling my case
[2:11:12.840 --> 2:11:19.400]  where uh some cops at the biggest nightclub there uh had had me jumped by their buddies
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:26.360]  and uh yeah i kind of got the best of them uh of those three that jumped me but uh nonetheless
[2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:31.800]  uh trooper picked me up on the way home uh as a buddy of mine was taking me to the hospital i
[2:11:31.800 --> 2:11:37.080]  broke one of my wrists but uh yeah the uh i had a case that probably would have shut all their good
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:43.480]  time friday and saturday night down but uh yeah i had a attorney that quit practicing law but also
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:50.920]  had an fbi friend that said let it go um yeah so when y'all mentioned fbi and that sort of thing
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:55.160]  at the time i didn't think he was a friend i thought he was just no i hear you i hear you brother
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:12:00.600]  it's all crazy how corrupt stuff is i saw cops stealing drugs when i was 14 years old and and
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:06.200]  dallas and busting kids that had had had bought drugs from their dealers so i i get it you got a
[2:12:06.200 --> 2:12:11.000]  question for jim yeah you've definitely relieved my psyche uh there's a lot of the people who've
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:16.760]  suffered worse than me uh free energy uh wanted to know uh jim these guys in australia that developed
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:21.640]  this perpetual motion machine i've been waiting for it to come out for five thousand dollars a pop
[2:12:21.640 --> 2:12:27.000]  to run your whole household uh have a feeling somebody's uh you know captured that project
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:31.400]  another question and you can answer these i'll just give you a couple of three uh hydrogen
[2:12:31.960 --> 2:12:37.240]  generator uh university missouri these guys used to stop people on the street and say hey can i
[2:12:37.240 --> 2:12:41.800]  run an experiment on your car i'll show you how to run on water and they pop a few hoses or do
[2:12:41.800 --> 2:12:47.880]  something and uh next thing you know they're running the car off of the water just a gallon
[2:12:47.880 --> 2:12:52.040]  here's the problem and just like you explained oh i you know i thought this you know they
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:56.680]  there's a lot of scammers who say they've got a system that'll run everything if you just come
[2:12:57.480 --> 2:13:02.440]  invest they can build it and i appreciate your call that's my problem but i know they had
[2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:07.880]  carburetors in the 60s that got 75 miles of the gallon i have them you know time magazine with the
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:13.080]  ad from general motors in it so i know they're suppressing things hell they're trying to shut
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:18.520]  down coal even though it's got problems because they don't control all of it so we know that's
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:26.760]  going on i appreciate your call any comments on what he said oh well uh yeah you do have to be
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:32.120]  careful and there are some scam artists out there so when they come around saying i'm wanting uh money
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:37.000]  but now if he if you're talking about when those students were showing how to run your car on water
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:42.600]  uh i think he can now as far as those people in austria don't hold your breath okay you're
[2:13:42.600 --> 2:13:48.440]  probably never going to hear about that again uh it's incredible how they shut down uh alternative
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:54.840]  energy but listen putting from a certified well-known company putting a windmill up at your house
[2:13:54.840 --> 2:13:59.640]  to power part of what you're doing that's real putting in solar just moving partially into it
[2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:04.840]  that's real mm-hmm that's true that's true and hydrogen could be real if they just pay attention
[2:14:04.840 --> 2:14:10.040]  to it but they uh they have put the kibosh on that they don't want you to think yeah there's no
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:15.080]  a lot of government saying it's looking into clean energy or new energy or alternative energy is
[2:14:15.080 --> 2:14:20.920]  because they know how hot it is right well solar there there's drawbacks on almost every alternative
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:26.600]  energy uh title you know you have to build something on the seacoast uh solar uh you gotta hope that
[2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:31.080]  you're gonna have a lot of sunlight and probably wouldn't work very well in seattle uh cold you
[2:14:31.080 --> 2:14:37.480]  gotta be somewhere where there's coal uh you know but hey hydrogen that's it's everywhere it's everywhere
[2:14:37.480 --> 2:14:43.320]  now hydrogen's the key that's the that's the the the whole moral of this show hydrogen hydrogen
[2:14:43.320 --> 2:14:50.600]  secrets the secrets of hydrogen with jim mar and if you ran your cars on hydrogen of a fascist
[2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:58.920]  if you run your car on hydrogen guess what your pollutant is oxygen hey watch it the clean
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:04.280]  coal plants put out carbon dioxide they list that as a pollutant they'll list oxygen as a pollutant
[2:15:04.280 --> 2:15:09.560]  you come out with those hydrogen generators they will list oxygen as a nerve agent well they've
[2:15:09.560 --> 2:15:15.480]  they will list it as a chemical weapon the punishable by immediate execution the epa is already
[2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:23.800]  declared that uh carbon uh dioxide is a dangerous gas and yet every time you exhale you're exhaling
[2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:28.920]  carbon dioxide plants breathe it plants with plants respirate they operate off that photosynthesis
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:35.800]  all right we got al gore calling in he's mad at you man bear pigus pigus wiggis you're on the air
[2:15:35.800 --> 2:15:42.120]  go ahead i'm calling in about the teapot dome scandal alex well welcome to the airwaves man
[2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:47.960]  bear pig good to have you here al gore good to talk to you guys hey uh jim can you take us back to
[2:15:47.960 --> 2:15:53.400]  dalas if you were there in fort worth when when kennedy was assassinated i mean i just love to
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:57.960]  pick your brain about that i mean that's i was born like a month before that happened and that's
[2:15:57.960 --> 2:16:02.680]  we'll do that we'll do that on some future show right is there this is the 50th anniversary he gets
[2:16:02.680 --> 2:16:07.240]  closer listen up it's about me what was it like when it happened though just briefly well what do
[2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:12.120]  you want to know what do you mean was it like well i good question i mean it's like when you were
[2:16:12.120 --> 2:16:16.680]  there i mean it so many of us who you know like it affected my whole life it woke me up and allowed
[2:16:16.680 --> 2:16:21.400]  me to wake up more when nine eleven came because come on you know a single gunman did it don't be
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:25.960]  a conspiracy there if you know if you know what they did to kennedy and it's obvious like you
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:31.880]  say alex 95 percent to a hundred half to anybody who studies it knows it's it's the government
[2:16:31.880 --> 2:16:37.000]  did it i think your question may be is that you know didn't want people aware and how come that
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:42.040]  that's been so controversial all these years right let me explain this to you people need to
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:49.000]  understand this and the polls back me up right now today well over half the people in this country
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:56.680]  detest maraca hussein obama okay i mean they don't like him at all some people even think he's the
[2:16:56.680 --> 2:17:02.200]  antichrist all right so tomorrow if we were suddenly told by the news that he had been
[2:17:02.200 --> 2:17:07.880]  assassinated you've got half the people in this country you go well good okay well now multiply
[2:17:07.880 --> 2:17:15.160]  that feeling by a factor of 10 because it was simpler straightforward more honest times and
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:20.520]  that's what happened at the kennedy assassination the rank and file average citizen thought he was
[2:17:20.520 --> 2:17:25.400]  cool thought he was nice had a beautiful wife and loved to see the kids crawling around he was great
[2:17:25.400 --> 2:17:32.200]  they loved him but the other half uh the and this unfortunately included the wealthy people
[2:17:32.760 --> 2:17:39.160]  and the uh the industrialists and the bankers and the military people they hated him and they
[2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:44.680]  thought he was at danger to the country so even though they had nothing to do with his killing
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:50.440]  it was okay by them yeah the whole system played along it was a different world back then one final
[2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:55.640]  comment uh man bear what yeah what led you to write crossfire jim and if you ever talked to
[2:17:55.640 --> 2:18:00.360]  like mark lanes obviously written some great books he's he's awesome i think he spearheaded a lot of
[2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:05.960]  the uh yeah what's the israel connection you were talking about that yesterday uh in your speech or
[2:18:05.960 --> 2:18:10.040]  also we had dinner talk about the israel thing that was another straw that broke the camel's
[2:18:10.040 --> 2:18:15.080]  back kennedy was shaking up the status quo he was going to pull abolish the fellow reserve take the
[2:18:15.080 --> 2:18:23.320]  troops out let black folks vote get us out of vietnam he also was balking at israel uh he wanted
[2:18:23.320 --> 2:18:29.080]  he was demanding that we inspect the demonic plant to make sure they weren't making nuclear weapons
[2:18:29.080 --> 2:18:34.120]  and he'd already made it clear that he was not going to allow us to ship weapons grade plutonium
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:39.320]  to israel something they really wanted and desperately needed so that was that i don't think
[2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:45.800]  that was the reason that he was killed but it was another one that added to the stars aligned yes a
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:51.640]  lot of people got six that yeah there was a whole series of agendas that that coalesced right there
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:59.320]  in 1963 and it was what's your bottom line on kennedy good guy or bad guy uh well because it
[2:18:59.320 --> 2:19:06.680]  looks like they killed maryland rome yeah well personally of course he was human and uh and uh
[2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:12.840]  kind of a rounder and you could claim that he was you know not a really good guy but i think on the
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:18.120]  total that he really believed he was president of the united states and he really believed he was
[2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:24.920]  going to take some steps to try to correct the uh injustices and imperfections in our system well
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:29.480]  that put him up against all the entrenched special interests who were used to making the decisions
[2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:34.120]  exactly he thought he was president and they showed him he wouldn't all right caller hope
[2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:39.720]  that answers the question mark in san jose california you're on the air yeah can i talk
[2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:45.480]  with mark dice dot com don't let him go that sounded like mark dice dot com all right man
[2:19:45.480 --> 2:19:48.600]  like i said we don't screen calls you're on air i don't know what to make of that but go ahead
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:57.320]  lbj jim uh i have a question in regards to the uss liberty and his uh part that he played there
[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:02.760]  well he got those people killed what else do you need to know
[2:20:02.760 --> 2:20:07.480]  he ordered to stand down to the aircraft carriers yeah yeah because didn't he say uh
[2:20:08.280 --> 2:20:13.480]  wasn't either one that kept talking about for reasons of national security well i think you
[2:20:13.480 --> 2:20:19.240]  i think what he actually meant was reasons of my personal security yeah plus the the israel
[2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:23.800]  obsessed group you can criticize israel then they say look you're covering up for israel
[2:20:23.800 --> 2:20:28.040]  because it's like part of the thing of only they expose israel so you can't be part of exposing
[2:20:28.040 --> 2:20:32.760]  it you must be part of it because only they are exposing it when i point out our government
[2:20:32.760 --> 2:20:37.640]  ordered to stand down and was involved with israel trying to false flag that ship to blame it on
[2:20:37.640 --> 2:20:44.360]  egypt as a pretext for a larger war and even the russians it was like uh basically the expansion
[2:20:44.360 --> 2:20:50.440]  of north woods but in the middle east so there's the larger players and they're like no well you
[2:20:50.440 --> 2:20:58.040]  know what a lot of people miss this too uh the father of modern israel is uh was uh baron roth
[2:20:58.040 --> 2:21:03.560]  child and the right so the rossiles created israel they were also the people who funded
[2:21:03.560 --> 2:21:08.600]  communism in russia they're also the people who created hitler in germany and they're also the
[2:21:08.600 --> 2:21:12.200]  people who run the united states through wall street and that's why they're in charge they're
[2:21:12.200 --> 2:21:17.400]  full spectrum dominance exactly they know how to set up the whole climate and then sit back as they
[2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:22.280]  all run against each other right so don't don't fall in the trap of thinking it's this versus them
[2:21:22.280 --> 2:21:28.280]  versus a russian versus the communist versus the zinus it's all one big ball of wax it's all corrupt
[2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:33.080]  gangsters that have studied how humans operate manipulating us good question caller let's go to
[2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:40.200]  show hobby i think i'm pronouncing it in oklahoma you're on the air uh thank you for my call thank
[2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:45.080]  you jim uh alex that's uh so hey but thank you very much for taking my call i've had a quick
[2:21:45.080 --> 2:21:50.680]  question for jim mars uh 9 11 the brook 9 11 we're coming up on the 12th year anniversary
[2:21:50.680 --> 2:21:57.400]  of 9 11 um there's a million muslim march in washington dc and there's been two movies were
[2:21:57.400 --> 2:22:04.200]  released white house down and lumpus that's fallen any false flag alert anything like that
[2:22:04.920 --> 2:22:07.800]  because they've got all these movies jim since you're looking quizzical
[2:22:09.240 --> 2:22:12.840]  where the white house is being attacked and i think that makes it like the white house is good
[2:22:12.840 --> 2:22:16.920]  the bad guys attack it it's the good guys i don't think that means they'll be an attack on the white
[2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:21.480]  house though they might do something like that i mean they love false flags right but we've so
[2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:28.040]  damaged the franchise of self-inflicted wounds well all i'm gonna say is and you can check out my
[2:22:28.040 --> 2:22:34.920]  book uh the terror conspiracy revisited and you're gonna find out that just like the bumper sticker
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:41.480]  9 11 was an inside job 9 11 was an inside job trust not only the executive branch but also
[2:22:41.480 --> 2:22:48.440]  don't trust congress and don't trust uh federal judges that's right to make sure that we're abiding
[2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:52.280]  by the constitution that's right well there's gonna be a problem then we're gonna have some
[2:22:52.280 --> 2:22:58.200]  problems oh really that's problem well it's like john j mccloy uh who was on the warring commission
[2:22:58.200 --> 2:23:03.480]  and was quoted as saying what we have to do is show the world that america is not just another
[2:23:03.480 --> 2:23:10.440]  banana republic where a conspiracy can change the government well unfortunately folks we are a banana
[2:23:10.440 --> 2:23:15.160]  republic and they did change the government that's right anytime you allow a globalist coup or an
[2:23:15.160 --> 2:23:19.960]  insider coup everything gets corrupt from there because their own people can't stop stealing
[2:23:19.960 --> 2:23:24.200]  and then the insiders on top don't want to stop their minions because they're all getting a piece
[2:23:24.200 --> 2:23:29.240]  of it and just everything collapses and you go from a shining castle on the hill to sewage running
[2:23:29.240 --> 2:23:33.640]  down the street and that's what corruption we're turning to a gangster society and there's only
[2:23:33.640 --> 2:23:39.240]  one rule of the game and that is don't give away the game don't tell anybody the games of foot
[2:23:39.240 --> 2:23:43.000]  and we're here giving the game up and we're giving the game we're here giving the trick
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:50.680]  up we're here exposing the entire cat cat and caboodle thank you sir three more calls jesse
[2:23:50.680 --> 2:23:57.560]  michael and clon let's talk to jesse and tahos you're on the air hey alec how's it going go we
[2:23:57.560 --> 2:24:04.920]  got jim marz here with us bud hey i wanted to start a couple of questions i guess um uh first off i
[2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:08.520]  just wondering whatever happened to hydrogen cars you know you heard all about him he thought it was
[2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:12.840]  going to be the next thing and then it just kind of was going to be hydrogen shells they always put
[2:24:12.840 --> 2:24:19.400]  it something it doesn't yeah exactly it could be hydrogen cars but uh they they were trying to go
[2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:24.280]  halfway they were trying to do public relations and say okay yeah we're gonna we're gonna start
[2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:30.120]  shifting to hydrogen but it had to be through a hydrogen cell so they can keep control over the
[2:24:30.120 --> 2:24:35.800]  look technology look this is 20 year old technology the smart phone at least the b2 bomber been around
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:40.600]  for 20 years before they rolled it out in 87 right they can have this little baby access the whole
[2:24:40.600 --> 2:24:46.200]  world run for hours take photos do the whole nine yards off off the electricity in the wall
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:52.680]  they are suppressing all types of stuff because once they turn loose of the energy control system
[2:24:52.680 --> 2:25:01.560]  in the economy in the microcosm that is your personal life in the larger ecosystem it's over
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:06.120]  and these are control freaks so they won't do it but as you see the world having less energy
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:13.000]  as you see the devaluation of currency you see rioting murder war expanding pollution they hope
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:18.520]  to ride all this to victory because they think they can screw everybody and get away with it
[2:25:18.520 --> 2:25:22.680]  you know it's like there's an article right here uh out of the london telegraph about how the
[2:25:22.680 --> 2:25:27.720]  cosmetics have all these chemicals and estrogen mimicers on them i talk about this and they attack
[2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:32.040]  me i mean do the elite think they're going to put out a bunch of poison in the food and water
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:38.920]  and not have it blow back on their kids i mean even if they think they're politically immune god is
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:43.400]  the spirit of the universe where everyone call it is not going to allow them to get away with this
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:48.760]  you reap what you sow man what comes around goes around you're not going to get away with
[2:25:48.760 --> 2:25:53.480]  trilling everybody and they're not getting away with it now they just don't understand that because
[2:25:53.480 --> 2:25:58.200]  they still control the mass media the richest families most their kids end up in mental institutions
[2:25:58.200 --> 2:26:03.000]  or commit suicide they're lucky if they got one kid out of five that learns how to tie their shoe
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:09.400]  laces oh man this is a great thing you've built let me tell you this is really good this is really
[2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:14.840]  working great you're really in charge of things because you're able to screw and rob everybody
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:21.240]  just being able to dominate is not the main sign of leadership two more calls michael in texas
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:28.520]  you're on the air go ahead going jim this is uh michael from texas and uh how you doing today alex
[2:26:28.520 --> 2:26:33.160]  i'm good go ahead start with your question well my question is this is i've been working on this
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:37.080]  uh guy mike stritsky that you're talking about i've been tracking him for years and i've actually
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:40.840]  started making a film about him and calling stritsky keys to the cage because he says we
[2:26:40.840 --> 2:26:44.840]  have the keys to the cage we just don't use it so i've been thinking i have a question for you
[2:26:45.560 --> 2:26:49.320]  if we were to if we were as a people were to all together decide
[2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:53.880]  that the way to take the power back is to take the fuel back and started working on having
[2:26:53.880 --> 2:26:59.240]  electrolyzers in everybody's home i know honda's already developed it uh ge yeah they got it they
[2:26:59.240 --> 2:27:04.040]  got it we did it if we did it and decided we were gonna do it wouldn't that just pull the power out
[2:27:04.040 --> 2:27:08.920]  from underneath the power supply because once we drive those costs down a fuel the the food prices
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:13.400]  would go down the economy would turn around 800 billion a year going out for fuel oh yeah the
[2:27:13.400 --> 2:27:18.440]  whole thing's like artificial scarcity well it's as simple we we're always we've been taught since
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:24.200]  childhood that man's basic necessities are food clothing and shelter and i'm here to tell you
[2:27:24.200 --> 2:27:30.600]  energy it's energy if you have energy you can plow and food is energy if you got energy you can
[2:27:30.600 --> 2:27:35.960]  make your clothes if you got energy you can build a house okay energy's it and hydrogens are the way
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:42.200]  to go and thank you for calling and thank you for absolutely color my look at this look at this so
[2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:47.320]  called quarter it has no silver in it now it's a new quarter but it's the symbol of energy in the
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:54.280]  past that had real silver in it which was a scarce commodity a real energy now it's the symbol of
[2:27:54.280 --> 2:28:00.440]  energy and they get the world for it i mean we are run by con artist yeah stop leave we just stop
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:06.360]  complying start talking start speaking out start questioning it's over well and what the caller
[2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:11.560]  saying and it's absolutely true is right now if you wanted to make your whole house energy independent
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:17.480]  with hydrogen you can do it but it's going to cost you fifty sixty thousand dollars and most
[2:28:17.480 --> 2:28:24.120]  people don't have that but it's supplied to man if everyone would say i want that then they'd start
[2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:28.280]  producing it the more they produce the little cheaper it would get and pretty soon they get it
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:32.840]  down to maybe a thousand dollars all right thousand dollars stop right there i want you to expand on
[2:28:32.840 --> 2:28:38.920]  that before we take these two final calls what what what he just said is the key to all of this
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:44.280]  why are the globalist waging war against the real free market against your vote your ideas real
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:50.200]  competitiveness with their collectivism with their austerity saying you can't have progress it
[2:28:50.200 --> 2:28:56.440]  hurts the earth because they're in a war to shut the economy down worldwide so you don't
[2:28:56.440 --> 2:29:02.840]  industrialize if you're in africa or so we don't go to the next level of near free energy because
[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:09.800]  once that happens their monopoly is over so they're in a race to kill the free market to shut the
[2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:16.760]  economy down with a planned economy to keep you in a dark age away from discovering all this because
[2:29:16.760 --> 2:29:22.200]  if we go to the new renaissance it's over for everything they've done elaborate on what you
[2:29:22.200 --> 2:29:28.040]  just said this and by the way they're losing they're sliding downhill they realize it they're
[2:29:28.040 --> 2:29:33.000]  losing they're losing they're starting to lose jim well and that's why they're losing because if
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:37.160]  they lose this they lose everything else well that's why they're they're losing it literally
[2:29:37.160 --> 2:29:43.240]  and figuratively and that's why they're militarizing the police so that they've got a a bulwark against
[2:29:43.240 --> 2:29:48.760]  the people you know to try to keep them in line it's it's absolutely amazing but let me tell you
[2:29:48.760 --> 2:29:57.160]  folks it's this simple if you want news turn in tune in cnn or abc or whoever but if you want to
[2:29:57.160 --> 2:30:02.760]  know what's really going on then listen to alex jones and others like him well this is history
[2:30:02.760 --> 2:30:07.640]  happening all i want is a real future for my children and grandchildren just like you do
[2:30:07.640 --> 2:30:13.400]  and these people running things are losers i mean i could go around and defraud people and
[2:30:13.400 --> 2:30:18.040]  run scams i don't do that because it feels bad because i can feel it's hurting myself
[2:30:18.760 --> 2:30:23.720]  and they need to get back to their basic human instinct and stop being losers well it's just
[2:30:23.720 --> 2:30:29.080]  like politicians you can't trust anything they say because they have to lie or they won't get
[2:30:29.080 --> 2:30:34.840]  elected okay that's not a con these are puppets yeah that it's not a condemnation personally
[2:30:34.840 --> 2:30:40.200]  of politicians it's just a sad fact of life is that they can't get elected unless they lie to you
[2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:44.360]  okay so you have to watch what they do you have to watch their track record so let's look at the
[2:30:44.360 --> 2:30:50.360]  track record of these so-called globalists as they call themselves these world elite okay just over
[2:30:50.360 --> 2:30:55.400]  the past hundred years we've had two world wars we've had a depression we've got an inflationary
[2:30:55.400 --> 2:31:02.360]  depression going on now hundreds of civil wars of little civil wars uh a degradation of life a
[2:31:02.360 --> 2:31:10.120]  degradation of uh of uh in the environment their track record folks is not good we need to get rid
[2:31:10.120 --> 2:31:16.040]  of them i agree one final call but this this is a historic broadcast it's a very important broadcast
[2:31:16.040 --> 2:31:21.880]  and i hope people pay attention to what's being said here because the establishment is a very
[2:31:21.880 --> 2:31:27.160]  unhappy group of failing people who use every dirty trick to stay in control but the dirty
[2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:32.440]  tricks they're using are destroying the very island they're sitting on let me put it this way
[2:31:32.440 --> 2:31:38.600]  folks here here's my final thing if you'll start and think about it you'll realize that i can assure
[2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:45.640]  you alex can assure you that we have the technology right off the shelf today to make the earth a
[2:31:45.640 --> 2:31:53.080]  garden spot we could provide basic food clothing shelter basic medical attention to every single
[2:31:53.080 --> 2:31:59.480]  living person on this planet okay but it's not happening is it in fact if you'll stop and think
[2:31:59.480 --> 2:32:04.440]  about it we don't like to know this we don't want to think about it but right now while you're
[2:32:04.440 --> 2:32:10.360]  listening to my voice you know that all around this world there are literally thousands if not
[2:32:10.360 --> 2:32:17.000]  millions of children 30 million a year starving to death okay i don't want that alex doesn't
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:22.680]  want that i don't think anybody listening wants that so why is it that way okay because i'm here
[2:32:22.680 --> 2:32:28.680]  to tell you somewhere somebody wants it that way and we got to figure out who that is and put a stop
[2:32:28.680 --> 2:32:35.960]  to it you're absolutely right they are blocking progress because they enjoy suffering they enjoy
[2:32:35.960 --> 2:32:43.080]  suppressing humanity they're on record saying it and it is totally and completely disgusting
[2:32:43.080 --> 2:32:48.440]  that they claim they want to industrialize cleanly these other countries but they actually block it
[2:32:49.560 --> 2:32:54.920]  it is incredible let's take one final call clone in illinois you're our last caller tonight go ahead
[2:32:55.640 --> 2:33:03.480]  hello yes hello gentlemen it's a great honor to speak with you today uh i've been a listener
[2:33:03.480 --> 2:33:09.640]  since about oh five alex i'm a prison planet uh member and i just started subscribing to the
[2:33:09.640 --> 2:33:15.320]  magazine i'm probably getting ready to go sign up on planted info wars but i just want to ask you a
[2:33:15.320 --> 2:33:22.120]  big question i i i just you know i just historically i think you're one of the greatest men at this
[2:33:22.120 --> 2:33:29.080]  particular juncture in time and i just i just want you to be very careful and if you if you stay alive
[2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:35.160]  i think you're going to change the world i mean noticeably globally uh and and i just i just want
[2:33:35.160 --> 2:33:43.240]  to ask you if you will be my honorary big brother today big brother like a 1984 six to the show
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:50.440]  and i can't get enough and and this is this i feel like your show has driven me almost completely
[2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:57.400]  crazy but i have a totally rational perspective on a worldview at the same time and and it's so
[2:33:57.400 --> 2:34:02.680]  difficult to get people to to wake up and if people know me they know you at the same time well
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:08.120]  look i mean it's easy to like unplug and and and and kind of go along with the matrix but i want
[2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:13.160]  you to unplug from its propaganda and just rediscover the world for yourself but but god
[2:34:13.160 --> 2:34:18.760]  bless you sir and i appreciate your call hey clone you know what's the worst thing about being a clone
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:24.840]  i had a question for jim yeah go ahead ask your question for jim but what's the worst thing about
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:30.760]  being a clone yeah the worst thing about being a clone yeah yeah you know what's the worst thing
[2:34:30.760 --> 2:34:37.000]  about being a clone that's just that that's just my student for today i know it's the worst thing
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:47.080]  about being a clone is you got nobody to blame but yourself no but it does come out of that we
[2:34:47.080 --> 2:34:52.760]  need to change the world yeah we need to decide to be good people the globalists think we're losers
[2:34:52.760 --> 2:34:57.320]  they've said they think we're losers and are we going to buy into this template they put out for
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:35:01.400]  us are we going to change that but what's your quick question for jim the people have brought
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:08.920]  this upon ourselves i know what's your question for jim i saw jim's uh video lecture about the
[2:35:10.120 --> 2:35:20.280]  this element monoatomic gold and um this this is what some perceive as the ancient mona
[2:35:20.280 --> 2:35:27.800]  that uh it's it's some say it's not also not even on the periodic table yeah people are always looking
[2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:33.000]  for uh you know al alchemical things that are going to fix everything and now with these big
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:36.600]  machines they've got a little high-powered electricity they can actually make new elements
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:39.880]  so there's a lot of weird stuff going on but what's your quick question we got to end it right now
[2:35:40.440 --> 2:35:46.200]  right quickening it you know everything's exponential even with you know alchemical science
[2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:51.000]  the jfk movie i want to know how that came about and possibly if you know there would
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:56.120]  ever be an rsk or an mlk movie that's a good idea good good to hear from you god bless that's a great
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:00.760]  way to end it all right let me try to make this real quick oliver stone of course was a vietnam
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:06.440]  veteran he got really upset about vietnam he did platoon and did on born on the fourth of july
[2:36:06.440 --> 2:36:11.720]  about what happened to veterans when they came back and it all had to do that and in his research
[2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:17.240]  and in his thinking it finally came back to why did we get into that vietnam war and he realized
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:23.960]  it went back to the kennedy assassination and that's why he did the movie jfk there you go
[2:36:23.960 --> 2:36:30.280]  closing comment jem mars great job on the broadcast tonight thank you alex thank you and i look forward
