[00:00.000 --> 00:09.600]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.600 --> 00:11.100]  You want answers?
[00:11.100 --> 00:12.720]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.720 --> 00:30.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:30.600 --> 00:38.120]  This will be a day long remember, the last stand of little Tim Geithner scammers.
[00:38.120 --> 00:43.240]  This could be the beginning of the complete collapse of the private Federal Reserve system.
[00:43.240 --> 00:47.880]  We are on the verge of an audit of the institution.
[00:47.880 --> 00:52.280]  Tim Geithner, as the head of the New York Fed, that controls the entire private Federal
[00:52.280 --> 00:55.040]  Reserve system, it's the true power position.
[00:55.040 --> 01:00.360]  The Fed chairman is a spokesman, a puppet.
[01:00.360 --> 01:06.840]  As head of the New York Fed, he worked with his former Goldman Sachs boss, then current
[01:06.840 --> 01:13.480]  Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, to give over $200 billion of the trillions of dollars
[01:13.480 --> 01:23.720]  stolen directly into the hands of AIG to then be secretly served out to Goldman Sachs,
[01:23.720 --> 01:31.160]  JP Morgan Chase, and others, directly benefiting the men that gave the orders to pump the $200
[01:31.160 --> 01:35.120]  plus billion into their own pockets.
[01:35.120 --> 01:38.880]  In open crime, we cover it in the Obama deception.
[01:38.880 --> 01:43.000]  We cover it in the fall of the Republic.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.240]  Ron Paul has been hammering it.
[01:45.240 --> 01:48.560]  The in the Fed movement has been hammering the truth.
[01:48.560 --> 01:54.400]  And make no mistake, we've done our job.
[01:54.400 --> 02:00.000]  As Ron Paul said in McKinney Ruffs outside Austin in 2004, I put him in my film, Matrix
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.280]  of Evil.
[02:01.280 --> 02:07.720]  He said, when the banks collapse society by design, we have to be there before, during
[02:07.720 --> 02:13.720]  and after explaining that they are the criminals, or they will use the crisis to give themselves
[02:13.720 --> 02:19.200]  unlimited financial power, a financial dictatorship.
[02:19.200 --> 02:28.480]  That's what Copenhagen was about, openly paying taxes on air travel, food, water, gasoline,
[02:28.480 --> 02:36.160]  GDP, cell phones, healthcare, everything to the private IMF and World Bank, who are the
[02:36.160 --> 02:42.160]  international holding companies of what we know of as the Bank of England and the private
[02:42.160 --> 02:44.160]  Federal Reserve.
[02:44.160 --> 02:51.080]  Now, just like with Al Capone, they got him on income tax evasion, couldn't get him for
[02:51.080 --> 02:57.320]  all the Valentine's Day massacres and the rest of it, couldn't get him for all the
[02:57.320 --> 03:03.880]  whorehouses, for all the liquor, for all the money laundering, for all the other murders.
[03:03.880 --> 03:11.000]  They got him on a technicality, and it's the same thing with little Timmy Geithner.
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.600]  He lied and said that, oh, he was the head of the New York Fed, but he knew nothing.
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.800]  Said this a month ago, he knew nothing like Sergeant Schultz says in Hogan's Heroes, I
[03:23.800 --> 03:29.920]  know nothing, I know nothing, nothing, nothing.
[03:29.920 --> 03:34.640]  And he told Congress that, he told the American people that.
[03:34.640 --> 03:40.400]  Well, he's on television live right now, and we're going to condense it down and play
[03:40.400 --> 03:44.200]  some clips later in the last hour today, and of course tomorrow, and hindsight will have
[03:44.200 --> 03:49.000]  time to analyze it, but the word is, he's still stonewalling, I have some transcripts
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.200]  here, I've been scanning over them.
[03:51.200 --> 03:56.200]  The word is, he's still defending himself and saying he knew nothing about the New York
[03:56.200 --> 04:07.560]  Federal Reserve that he headed, ordering, ordering AIG to not disclose in financial filings
[04:07.560 --> 04:16.960]  and to Congress and to the IRS that the lion's share of the money was going to Goldman Sachs
[04:16.960 --> 04:20.680]  and other secretive institutions.
[04:20.680 --> 04:32.200]  And now I have Bloomberg, I have Reuters, I have several other mainstream publications,
[04:32.200 --> 04:40.400]  My Bank Tracker, reporting they've got the email, they've got the email where Geithner
[04:40.400 --> 04:43.880]  was calling the shots, of course he was.
[04:43.880 --> 04:51.600]  This guy, even the nation magazine is saying, needs to go to prison.
[04:51.600 --> 04:57.440]  Prison, you are an open criminal Geithner, and we've called you out, not enough for
[04:57.440 --> 05:01.680]  you to resign, you need to go to prison.
[05:01.680 --> 05:05.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[05:05.400 --> 05:08.560]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[05:08.560 --> 05:14.200]  These are finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[05:14.200 --> 05:15.200]  at home.
[05:15.200 --> 05:18.560]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[05:18.560 --> 05:19.560]  calling the shots.
[05:19.560 --> 05:24.960]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[05:24.960 --> 05:30.360]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[05:30.360 --> 05:35.040]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[05:35.040 --> 05:39.400]  It's him Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[05:39.400 --> 05:41.560]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[05:41.560 --> 05:47.440]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[05:47.440 --> 05:48.440]  of the republic.
[05:48.440 --> 05:54.840]  Yet you're copy a fall of the republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[05:54.840 --> 06:02.440]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:02.440 --> 06:25.560]  As of now, I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[06:25.560 --> 06:31.120]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[06:31.120 --> 06:35.760]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[06:35.760 --> 06:40.160]  It's him Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[06:40.160 --> 06:42.320]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[06:42.320 --> 06:48.200]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[06:48.200 --> 06:49.200]  of the republic.
[06:49.200 --> 06:55.600]  Yet you're copy a fall of the republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[06:55.600 --> 07:01.200]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[07:01.200 --> 07:05.480]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[07:05.480 --> 07:08.760]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[07:08.760 --> 07:12.960]  Our God given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our
[07:12.960 --> 07:15.680]  lives and our families health are in jeopardy.
[07:15.680 --> 07:20.480]  If we the people do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost
[07:20.480 --> 07:21.480]  forever.
[07:21.480 --> 07:26.240]  Utopia silver is known for fighting for health freedom and we will not meekly allow ourselves
[07:26.240 --> 07:31.240]  to be led as lambs to the slaughter sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery
[07:31.240 --> 07:34.560]  that are being placed on America is not an option.
[07:34.560 --> 07:37.480]  Please stand with utopia silver in this fight.
[07:37.480 --> 07:41.680]  Utopia silver carry some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and
[07:41.680 --> 07:44.960]  numerous other high quality health supplements.

[08:00.560 --> 08:06.480]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[08:06.480 --> 08:15.280]  a war on for your mind.
[08:15.280 --> 08:24.560]  It's a very, very special day in the fight against the private parasite corporate government
[08:24.560 --> 08:29.080]  that is ruling the planet right now illegitimately.
[08:29.080 --> 08:34.880]  It's so criminal, it's so fraudulent, it's so illegitimate that if we just expose these
[08:34.880 --> 08:41.560]  people and all the public crimes they commit, they will fall.
[08:41.560 --> 08:49.200]  And the aura of invincibility, the aura of infallibility, the aura of omnipresent godlikeness
[08:49.200 --> 08:54.640]  of the Wall Street criminal class is evaporating.
[08:54.640 --> 09:04.000]  It is a parasitic group of reprobate, control freaks, psychopaths, sociopathic looters who
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.080]  founded the CIA, who have turned America into an engine of evil and tyranny, who run the
[09:11.080 --> 09:16.160]  modern environmental movement as a pretext to tax and control our lives.
[09:16.160 --> 09:21.800]  And all of these facts have gone from being something that maybe 5% of the population
[09:21.800 --> 09:29.920]  knew 10 years ago, maybe 5, to I'd say about 40% of the population now understand this.
[09:29.920 --> 09:36.160]  I mean, really understand it, and according to Gallup polls, it was 75% that wanted to
[09:36.160 --> 09:39.680]  audit or abolish the Fed what, six, eight months ago.
[09:39.680 --> 09:45.800]  I saw a poll of right at 90% just a few weeks ago that want to abolish the Fed and want
[09:45.800 --> 09:47.760]  criminal investigations of it.
[09:47.760 --> 09:54.440]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, the flu hoax blew up in their face.
[09:54.440 --> 09:58.440]  Criminal investigations, everything we said now coming out mainstream news.
[09:58.440 --> 10:03.480]  Their WMDs blew up in their face, pun intended.
[10:03.480 --> 10:09.040]  Their banker bailout, it's now been exposed, was of course a complete swindle and a fraud
[10:09.040 --> 10:14.480]  and staged, and they engage in financial terrorism saying, we're going to have a depression
[10:14.480 --> 10:15.960]  if you don't give us these trillions.
[10:15.960 --> 10:20.720]  And then we got the Goldman Sachs documents, thanks to McClatchy newspapers, where they
[10:20.720 --> 10:24.880]  were engineering the whole thing to destroy their competition, make trillions of dollars
[10:24.880 --> 10:29.960]  and consolidate power.
[10:29.960 --> 10:37.520]  Their global warming, their man-made global warming fraud completely imploded in absolute
[10:37.520 --> 10:39.200]  complete retreat.
[10:39.200 --> 10:46.800]  The BBC, The Age, all the big establishment publications and TV networks who were stonewalling
[10:46.800 --> 10:49.680]  Climate Gate now say, okay, it's a complete fraud.
[10:49.680 --> 10:55.840]  I mean, I have stacks of news here today, because see, their stonewalling only destroys
[10:55.840 --> 10:58.960]  them faster.
[10:58.960 --> 11:06.440]  Their stonewalling, their hoaxes, when they're caught red-handed, it's like coming in the
[11:06.440 --> 11:10.800]  kitchen and your five-year-old has climbed up on the counter and has their hand in the
[11:10.800 --> 11:15.880]  cookie jar, and they're not supposed to do that without permission, and their hand is
[11:15.880 --> 11:19.360]  in it, and they look at you and say, my hand is not in the cookie jar.
[11:19.360 --> 11:23.320]  They get in a lot more trouble for that.
[11:23.320 --> 11:27.440]  But this isn't a five-year-old climbing up on the counter, getting a cookie.
[11:27.440 --> 11:31.480]  This is criminals in suits robbing all of us.
[11:31.480 --> 11:37.380]  If we don't expose them, if we don't arrest them, they are going to foist Northcom, Homeland
[11:37.380 --> 11:47.000]  Security on us as the mafia thugs, the mafia street enforcers for their mafia operation
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.600]  to pick up every man, woman, and child by their ankles and shake their pockets empty
[11:52.600 --> 11:56.440]  into their giant gutters of cash.
[11:56.440 --> 11:58.440]  It's simple.
[11:58.440 --> 12:01.120]  They have done all this premeditatedly.
[12:01.120 --> 12:07.680]  They have created enough money for themselves to buy the world over not hundreds, but thousands
[12:07.680 --> 12:08.680]  of times.
[12:08.680 --> 12:12.720]  According to the Economist we've interviewed, they all agree, thousands of times.
[12:12.720 --> 12:16.920]  They can buy the whole world thousands of times, but it's all made up just because they
[12:16.920 --> 12:21.840]  run the Pentagon and run Northcom and wear fancy suits and sit up there with their Ivy
[12:21.840 --> 12:26.240]  League repertoire of baloney.
[12:26.240 --> 12:34.800]  Doesn't mean that they are allowed to just create enough currency and credit for themselves
[12:34.800 --> 12:39.960]  to buy the world while it's not enough for them because they have to force you to sell.
[12:39.960 --> 12:45.360]  So they have to shut Main Street down, shut the main economy down, shut the culture down,
[12:45.360 --> 12:50.920]  bankrupt, drive everybody into the poor house so they can be the lender of last resort and
[12:50.920 --> 12:52.040]  run our lives.
[12:52.040 --> 12:53.840]  They want to bankrupt the states.
[12:53.840 --> 12:55.680]  They want to bankrupt the hospitals.
[12:55.680 --> 13:02.640]  They want to bankrupt everything, and they're doing a great job of it, but Ron Paul, myself
[13:02.640 --> 13:10.760]  and millions of other people have been there for decades exposing this parasite class and
[13:10.760 --> 13:16.000]  what they've done and millions of patriotic Americans who knew the truth and who got laughed
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.200]  at by their neighbors when you told them that the Federal Reserve was predatory, that it
[13:20.200 --> 13:21.320]  was parasitic.
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.080]  They were creating a giant bubble to implode the economy by design.
[13:26.080 --> 13:31.720]  People 15 years ago, I remember writing books and publications about how the Club of Rome
[13:31.720 --> 13:36.680]  planned to implode the world economy and make everybody buy carbon taxes from the IMF
[13:36.680 --> 13:42.040]  and World Bank because that's what the Club of Rome said they would do.
[13:42.040 --> 13:47.000]  There were people in the 60s that knew the enemy's game plan, and who were they?
[13:47.000 --> 13:58.880]  People like Anthony Sutton at Stanford Research, at major institutions like the Hoover Institution,
[13:58.880 --> 14:04.720]  congressional investigators, former generals, CIA officers.
[14:04.720 --> 14:09.400]  I mean, do you know who the founders of the Patriot Movement were?
[14:09.400 --> 14:14.360]  You know, like 50 years ago, they were mainly people in the system who were told the plan
[14:14.360 --> 14:18.720]  and they said, I am not going along with this.
[14:18.720 --> 14:26.880]  And back then, they killed most people who were insiders and blew the whistle because
[14:26.880 --> 14:30.560]  they knew if this got out early, they would have never been able to carry it out.
[14:30.560 --> 14:36.120]  But the good news is, in the last 20 years, there have been too many of us telling the
[14:36.120 --> 14:42.600]  truth for them to intimidate us all, co-intel, pro us all, demonize us all, kill us all,
[14:42.600 --> 14:43.600]  audit us all.
[14:43.600 --> 14:50.360]  Oh, if you were a Red Beckman, an Air Force officer who found out about this in the 50s
[14:50.360 --> 14:54.320]  and you came out and exposed it, yeah, they came and tried to take his kids and bulldozed
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.600]  his house and did everything else to him under the sun.
[14:59.600 --> 15:08.080]  You think I did what the men and women sacrificed when nobody knew this information, maybe one
[15:08.080 --> 15:17.280]  tenth of one percent out of a hundred, but maybe one in a thousand knew what they went
[15:17.280 --> 15:23.600]  through, the hell they went through to bring you this information all these years so that
[15:23.600 --> 15:30.680]  now, right as the New World Order is openly being founded, it is beginning to collapse
[15:30.680 --> 15:34.040]  and they will continue to build on top of the collapse structures.
[15:34.040 --> 15:40.800]  It will continue to get worse, but you can see the mathematics, they still got the initiative
[15:40.800 --> 15:46.320]  and the money and the power, but it's eroding faster and faster and we've reached the way
[15:46.320 --> 15:51.000]  point where there's all these huge structures of the New World Order that still have to
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.240]  be exposed, routed out, dealt with.
[15:57.240 --> 16:03.920]  Society has been scientifically degenerated into a bunch of backstabbing goblin-like creatures
[16:03.920 --> 16:08.240]  and so even if you remove the current crop of criminals, if the institutions and the
[16:08.240 --> 16:16.400]  power structure and the big government still there, it will be peopled by even worse scum,
[16:16.400 --> 16:23.320]  more reckless scum, so there are great dangers.
[16:23.320 --> 16:29.080]  Don't just think because we are exposing this group of criminals that the structure doesn't
[16:29.080 --> 16:39.160]  live on, it must be removed, it must be absolutely decimated, it must be pulverized, it must
[16:39.160 --> 16:46.400]  be annihilated, the salt must be put into the earth in the enemy institutions.
[16:46.400 --> 16:56.200]  We must not leave one stone in their system standing.
[16:56.200 --> 16:57.200]  You understand that?
[16:57.200 --> 17:06.440]  It's like in the Soviet Union, every single statue of Mao and Lenin and Stalin need to
[17:06.440 --> 17:07.840]  be pulled down.
[17:07.840 --> 17:11.640]  It's the same thing.
[17:11.640 --> 17:13.400]  These are the enemies of humanity.
[17:13.400 --> 17:19.640]  I'm watching Geithner live right now on television and gone is all that arrogance.
[17:19.640 --> 17:21.680]  Gone is the power trip.
[17:21.680 --> 17:24.400]  His body language has completely changed.
[17:24.400 --> 17:26.200]  He is a cornered rat.
[17:26.200 --> 17:32.360]  He is an arrogant sacrificial lamb for the bankers and look, this isn't going to work,
[17:32.360 --> 17:34.880]  throwing him under the bus.
[17:34.880 --> 17:39.720]  They've tried to put up this facade that they've done nothing wrong and no one could stop them.
[17:39.720 --> 17:42.040]  It's not going to work.
[17:42.040 --> 17:50.280]  Bernanke, Greenspan, Summers, Rubin, the private executives at the big banks and brokerage
[17:50.280 --> 17:57.160]  firms who worked in tandem with government in all of these different swindling operations.
[17:57.160 --> 18:01.640]  They need to go to prison.
[18:01.640 --> 18:09.080]  These guys have stolen amounts of money millions of times larger than what the Keating Five
[18:09.080 --> 18:10.080]  did.
[18:10.080 --> 18:12.960]  The Keating Five stole a couple billion.
[18:12.960 --> 18:21.760]  We're talking about 1.5 quadrillion, 1,500 trillion.
[18:21.760 --> 18:22.760]  I don't know.
[18:22.760 --> 18:27.600]  Different estimates are 3 to 10 billion that the Keating Five swindled because the accounting
[18:27.600 --> 18:31.760]  and the federal government and the whitewashes, but let's just say it's 3 billion.
[18:31.760 --> 18:36.000]  Jared, do me a calculation and a calculator if you can on the computer.
[18:36.000 --> 18:47.720]  When you divide 3 billion into 1,500 trillion, how much bigger is that magnitude of fraud?
[18:47.720 --> 18:52.360]  Because I don't want to just guesstimate, say, this is thousands of times bigger than
[18:52.360 --> 18:55.840]  the swindles.
[18:55.840 --> 19:05.120]  This is a tsunami, a solid wall of fiat garbage derivatives, and hey, it's worked good for
[19:05.120 --> 19:13.360]  in the last decade buying up everything, media, industry, defense, cities, counties, land.
[19:13.360 --> 19:16.800]  If you won't sell, they use the environmental brigades.
[19:16.800 --> 19:20.080]  They openly fund to take over your property.
[19:20.080 --> 19:25.520]  You go to a smart growth conference like they have here in Austin every few years, and it's
[19:25.520 --> 19:29.560]  nothing but bankers up on the stage saying, here's how we're going to take everybody's
[19:29.560 --> 19:30.560]  property.
[19:30.560 --> 19:32.240]  They don't even hide it.
[19:32.240 --> 19:38.320]  I remember in 1998, the first time I went to one, I was as wide as a sheet, watching
[19:38.320 --> 19:41.320]  them hour after hour just celebrating openly their evil.
[19:41.320 --> 19:44.080]  Yeah, well, listen, you arrogant crooks.
[19:44.080 --> 19:45.920]  This is the beginning of the end for you.
[19:45.920 --> 19:49.240]  Geithner has been caught red-handed.
[19:49.240 --> 19:56.440]  He lied and said that he didn't give the orders to AIG to hide the money to Goldman
[19:56.440 --> 20:00.600]  Sachs, and now it's come out, and we have the emails, he's a big, fat liar.

[21:01.320 --> 21:02.320]  Gold isn't for you?
[21:02.320 --> 21:06.280]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious
[21:06.280 --> 21:07.560]  metal investing firms.
[21:07.560 --> 21:08.560]  I get it.
[21:08.560 --> 21:12.280]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the
[21:12.280 --> 21:16.840]  Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security would
[21:16.840 --> 21:18.040]  be there for you.
[21:18.040 --> 21:19.280]  That's not what's happening.
[21:19.280 --> 21:24.120]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the
[21:24.120 --> 21:27.720]  dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[21:27.720 --> 21:31.160]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[21:31.160 --> 21:35.520]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[21:35.520 --> 21:41.440]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[21:41.440 --> 21:44.800]  But now savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[21:44.800 --> 21:45.800]  You should, too.
[21:45.800 --> 21:46.800]  Find out what they know.
[21:46.800 --> 21:53.320]  Call us, and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free 800-686-2237.
[21:53.320 --> 21:56.120]  800-686-2237.
[21:56.120 --> 22:02.200]  That's 800-686-2237.
[22:02.200 --> 22:05.920]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[22:05.920 --> 22:09.080]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[22:09.080 --> 22:13.440]  These are finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[22:13.440 --> 22:14.440]  at home.
[22:14.440 --> 22:19.080]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[22:19.080 --> 22:20.080]  calling the shots.
[22:20.080 --> 22:25.480]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[22:25.480 --> 22:28.720]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[22:28.720 --> 22:34.560]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing
[22:34.560 --> 22:35.560]  world government.
[22:35.560 --> 22:37.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[22:37.560 --> 22:41.880]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[22:41.880 --> 22:48.040]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[22:48.040 --> 22:49.040]  of the republic.

[23:00.160 --> 23:02.600]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[23:02.600 --> 23:06.680]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.
[23:06.680 --> 23:10.440]  Need listening for a special offer from PowerVapor.com.
[23:10.440 --> 23:14.200]  Standard tobacco cigarettes contain over 4,000 harmful chemicals.
[23:14.200 --> 23:19.680]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco, and experience true smoking
[23:19.680 --> 23:20.680]  freedom.
[23:20.680 --> 23:25.440]  PowerVapor.com is an e-cigarette, with the look, feel, and smoke of a real cigarette.

[23:56.200 --> 24:20.960]  PowerVapor.com, the smoking gun heard round the world.
[24:20.960 --> 24:32.360]  Webster Tarpley, Economist, George Humphrey Economist, Top Trader, Analyst, Bob Chapman.
[24:32.360 --> 24:40.200]  They all agree, along with many other economists we've interviewed, that it is at least $1,500
[24:40.200 --> 24:48.400]  trillion, or $1.5 quadrillion, stolen and artificially created, which then devalues
[24:48.400 --> 24:53.120]  the world's currencies, though all the currencies are being devalued simultaneously in a coordinated
[24:53.120 --> 24:56.400]  fashion to attempt to hide it from the world population.
[24:56.400 --> 25:01.880]  You heard Dr. Mark Fauber, top analyst and economist from Switzerland yesterday saying
[25:01.880 --> 25:04.240]  the same thing.
[25:04.240 --> 25:06.520]  This robs everyone.
[25:06.520 --> 25:10.360]  Now the Keating 5, and I pulled it up during the break, I was correct, they're estimated
[25:10.360 --> 25:13.680]  to steal between $2 billion and $10 billion.
[25:13.680 --> 25:17.520]  No one really knows because then you can look at other markets that affected, but the amount
[25:17.520 --> 25:19.720]  of money they got was just a few billion.
[25:19.720 --> 25:22.120]  Let's just say $3 billion.
[25:22.120 --> 25:23.120]  There's different numbers.
[25:23.120 --> 25:27.760]  I mean, let's say it's $10 billion, but we did the numbers at $3 billion, $3 billion
[25:27.760 --> 25:29.760]  divided into $1.5 quadrillion.
[25:29.760 --> 25:34.880]  In fact, somebody ought to write a blurb at infowars.com or prismplanet.com, one of our
[25:34.880 --> 25:36.640]  great writers, and point this out.
[25:36.640 --> 25:43.880]  What the Keating 5 stole, what they actually physically got, versus what the bankers have
[25:43.880 --> 25:45.120]  done.
[25:45.120 --> 25:54.440]  So $1.5 quadrillion, $1,500 trillion, when divided by $3 billion.
[25:54.440 --> 25:56.600]  Matt Ryan, what did you guys come up with?
[25:56.600 --> 26:01.120]  Well, we put it through Wolfram Alfa, which is the most advanced calculation engine on
[26:01.120 --> 26:02.240]  the web today.
[26:02.240 --> 26:07.640]  We found that $3 billion will go into $1.5 quadrillion 500,000 times.
[26:07.640 --> 26:14.680]  So, see, I just said this is thousands of times bigger, because I knew that was conservative.
[26:14.680 --> 26:17.480]  But we want to be scientifically specific here.
[26:17.480 --> 26:24.240]  So, give people the magnitude of those numbers, Matt Ryan, one more time.
[26:24.240 --> 26:38.320]  $3 billion will go into $1.5 quadrillion exactly 500,000 times, 500,000 times bigger of a scam
[26:38.320 --> 26:41.560]  than the biggest in history with the Keating 5.
[26:41.560 --> 26:44.000]  Absolutely.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.680]  And the numbers here are undeniable.
[26:46.680 --> 26:47.680]  It's a remarkable...
[26:47.680 --> 26:50.880]  And Professor Black says the same thing and follow the Republic, too.
[26:50.880 --> 26:56.680]  He says this is by orders of magnitude that this is almost the power of infinity.
[26:56.680 --> 26:57.680]  Pretty much, yes.
[26:57.680 --> 26:58.680]  I mean, this is...
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.600]  They made infinity money for themselves, and they've got the Pentagon, who they bought
[27:02.600 --> 27:05.120]  off, and all these big companies standing around.
[27:05.120 --> 27:06.960]  Are you guys in the Pentagon?
[27:06.960 --> 27:08.120]  I'm talking about the brass.
[27:08.120 --> 27:09.560]  The rank and follow have no idea.
[27:09.560 --> 27:11.160]  Are you really going along with this?
[27:11.160 --> 27:15.560]  We stage a few terror attacks, so the public lets you garrison troops, and then we get
[27:15.560 --> 27:19.240]  the internal Homeland Security documents, and, of course, the number one enemy is returning
[27:19.240 --> 27:23.800]  veterans with guns, libertarians, conservatives, and in the fetters.
[27:23.800 --> 27:25.800]  The enemy of the criminal bankers.
[27:25.800 --> 27:28.880]  The enemy of the criminal bankers is the number one enemy of Homeland Security.
[27:28.880 --> 27:31.560]  I mean, it's a very simple equation, Matt Ryan.
[27:31.560 --> 27:32.560]  I mean, absolutely.
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.000]  I mean, if you look at these figures and you compare it, for example, to us versus Bill
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.400]  Gates, it would make Bill Gates look like a penniless bum.
[27:39.400 --> 27:44.440]  I mean, if you look at just how much money these people stole, it's $500,000.
[27:44.440 --> 27:48.840]  Well, that's why when you hear Bill Gates as the richest man in the world with $70 billion
[27:48.840 --> 27:51.640]  or whatever, it's a complete joke.
[27:51.640 --> 27:58.960]  The Queen of England had tens of billions of dollars in 1800s numbers.
[27:58.960 --> 28:05.360]  I mean, the Rockefellers were billionaires in 1900, and they scammed everybody just
[28:05.360 --> 28:09.560]  like with the Federal Reserve Act, they had the banks come out against the Federal Reserve
[28:09.560 --> 28:13.720]  Act to trick everyone like they had the insurance companies who wrote it's now come out.
[28:13.720 --> 28:20.760]  The insurance takeover, the healthcare debacle, the insurance not bailout, but robbery.
[28:20.760 --> 28:23.560]  Again, all of these are robbery hoaxes.
[28:23.560 --> 28:27.320]  9-11's a police state, launch war hoax.
[28:27.320 --> 28:33.320]  The flu is a set up a military dictatorship, set up a force inoculation dictatorship, make
[28:33.320 --> 28:35.560]  tens of billions hoax.
[28:35.560 --> 28:40.320]  The global climate change is a banker hoax to steal trillions and to get control over
[28:40.320 --> 28:43.080]  all industry and be able to shut down whoever they don't like.
[28:43.080 --> 28:44.880]  The banker bailout was on a banker bailout.
[28:44.880 --> 28:46.920]  It was a takeover.
[28:46.920 --> 28:50.240]  When they pop their Ponzi scheme, they get it then get even more power.
[28:50.240 --> 28:53.640]  They make money on the way up and the way down.
[28:53.640 --> 28:56.980]  There's no telling what these people have got.
[28:56.980 --> 29:06.440]  A lot of analysts we've talked to estimate that the Rothschilds are worth $300 trillion
[29:06.440 --> 29:14.800]  because you see just because they create 1.5 quadrillion or $1,500 trillion doesn't mean
[29:14.800 --> 29:15.800]  it's real.
[29:15.800 --> 29:19.560]  They have to use fake environmentalism to take property, bankrupt states to get real
[29:19.560 --> 29:20.720]  assets.
[29:20.720 --> 29:23.640]  They don't really have all that money.
[29:23.640 --> 29:26.320]  Give the people the number one more time, Matt Ryan.
[29:26.320 --> 29:42.440]  $500 billion will go into 1.5 quadrillion, $500,000, that's $500,000 of the total amount.
[29:42.440 --> 29:43.440]  Thank you for joining us.
[29:43.440 --> 29:44.440]  I was correct.
[29:44.440 --> 29:47.440]  It's thousands of times bigger, just 500,000 times bigger.
[29:47.440 --> 29:51.000]  We'll be right back.
[29:51.000 --> 29:52.320]  We're on the march.
[29:52.320 --> 29:54.720]  The empire's on the run.
[29:54.720 --> 30:00.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.240 --> 30:05.520]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[30:05.520 --> 30:08.240]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[30:08.240 --> 30:13.400]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[30:13.400 --> 30:18.080]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[31:09.240 --> 31:14.240]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[31:14.240 --> 31:19.760]  I've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[31:19.760 --> 31:20.760]  shots.
[31:20.760 --> 31:25.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[31:25.600 --> 31:31.040]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[31:31.040 --> 31:35.760]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[31:35.760 --> 31:40.080]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[31:40.080 --> 31:42.040]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[31:42.040 --> 31:48.080]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[31:48.080 --> 31:49.440]  of the Republic.

[32:08.760 --> 32:12.280]  It's called protogrow, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems
[32:12.280 --> 32:16.720]  to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[32:16.720 --> 32:20.480]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[32:20.480 --> 32:24.600]  Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases
[32:24.600 --> 32:28.040]  bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[32:28.040 --> 32:31.280]  Protogrow works by providing geometric keys, which have the capacity to actually unlock
[32:31.280 --> 32:33.840]  the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[32:33.840 --> 32:36.880]  Protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary
[32:36.880 --> 32:39.400]  taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[32:39.400 --> 32:42.920]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[32:42.920 --> 32:46.480]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hygrids, it's now easy.
[32:46.480 --> 32:51.600]  GCN listeners who want to grow derp-sheaf superfoods should visit the protogrow website at growlikedcrazy.com.
[32:51.600 --> 32:57.160]  That's www.growlikedcrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[32:57.160 --> 33:07.160]  That's www.growlikedcrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[33:27.160 --> 33:43.920]  Well, little Timmy Geithner is done with his testimony, and Henry Boulson is swaggering
[33:43.920 --> 33:47.960]  in, but he looks like a balloon that's had the air taken out of it, looks like a man
[33:47.960 --> 33:50.040]  marching to the gallows.
[33:50.040 --> 33:55.200]  And let me tell you, that's one of the big kingpins right there, boy.
[33:55.200 --> 34:00.440]  He gave himself a waiver as the head of the Department of the Treasury, the Secretary
[34:00.440 --> 34:06.120]  of the Treasury, to give himself 200-plus million in one payment out of the billions
[34:06.120 --> 34:13.520]  given to AIG that was then given to Goldman Sachs that he was the former head of.
[34:13.520 --> 34:18.640]  And his former employee, former Goldman Sachs executive, Tim Geithner at the private New
[34:18.640 --> 34:25.120]  York Fed, the head corporation that runs the whole system in North America and is one
[34:25.120 --> 34:30.200]  of the majority owners, it's all very secretive, but the word is the Federal Reserve is the
[34:30.200 --> 34:37.800]  majority owner, partners with the Bank of England over the IMF and World Bank.
[34:37.800 --> 34:43.480]  And he is now testifying, I can't wait for everybody to pull the juicy clips out of
[34:43.480 --> 34:50.480]  this and aggregate it up on YouTube, we'll have it all up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[34:50.480 --> 34:51.480]  for you by this evening.
[34:51.480 --> 34:57.560]  We've got Curtin, M.O., Paul Watson, Steve Watson and others, Aaron Dyches on assignment
[34:57.560 --> 35:05.880]  in California interviewing Dr. Stan Monteef for the upcoming film we're working on and
[35:05.880 --> 35:12.440]  then he's going to Tennessee to interview someone else, so let's leave it at that.
[35:12.440 --> 35:16.880]  But very, very exciting, what's going on?
[35:16.880 --> 35:24.760]  Here's Bloomberg, Fed emailed Geithner, cites bank benefit from AIG.
[35:24.760 --> 35:31.240]  Timothy F. Geithner has denied that the financial condition of American International Group,
[35:31.240 --> 35:38.640]  Inc.'s bank counterparties was a consideration in structuring the insurer bailout, was told
[35:38.640 --> 35:43.680]  by a senior colleague that the rescue was a way to remove uncertainty from the firms.
[35:43.680 --> 35:52.720]  But he said he knew nothing about that as if the head of the New York Fed didn't know
[35:52.720 --> 36:07.520]  that New York Fed lawyers, because they're the real boss, told AIG not to disclose who
[36:07.520 --> 36:09.800]  was getting the money.
[36:09.800 --> 36:17.640]  And Geithner and Paul Watson and all the rest of them, this whole gaggle of thieves, Summers,
[36:17.640 --> 36:23.520]  Reuben, all of them have been on television, they've testified saying we won't let you
[36:23.520 --> 36:27.360]  know where the money is.
[36:27.360 --> 36:33.560]  Private Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke over and over again, how many clips do I have
[36:33.560 --> 36:38.920]  in Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic with them live on television saying under
[36:38.920 --> 36:53.440]  oath, we will not tell you where the bailout money went.
[36:53.440 --> 37:00.880]  So that's their public policy is to criminally say we won't tell you where the money went.
[37:00.880 --> 37:06.560]  But then it is public knowledge because of tax returns that he gave himself, Henry Paulson
[37:06.560 --> 37:16.080]  testifying live now on Capitol Hill, that he gave himself a waiver for over $200 million.
[37:16.080 --> 37:19.160]  And he's just a mid-level capo.
[37:19.160 --> 37:28.440]  That's what a mid-level capo gets for running the heist for the owners of the system.
[37:28.440 --> 37:34.040]  We always hear about CEOs, we always hear about bag men, we always hear about Geithner
[37:34.040 --> 37:39.320]  and Summers and Reuben making their hundreds of millions.
[37:39.320 --> 37:45.400]  One of the big banks involved in the scam, their CEO, I saw the number got over $2 billion
[37:45.400 --> 37:47.680]  in one year.
[37:47.680 --> 37:51.880]  But that's nothing, you never hear about the shareholders.
[37:51.880 --> 37:58.560]  The big diversion is capping CEOs pay and things like that and oh, look at the bonuses.
[37:58.560 --> 38:00.960]  That's all a red herring.
[38:00.960 --> 38:12.040]  It's the trillions, 28 plus trillion and growing in the last, what is it, October 2008, October,
[38:12.040 --> 38:24.280]  November, December, and then 12 months, that's 15 months, January is almost over.
[38:24.280 --> 38:35.240]  So in the last 16 months, a few days shy of 16 months, October 3rd, when they got the
[38:35.240 --> 38:40.120]  power to steal whatever they wanted, at least on paper, fraudulently.
[38:40.120 --> 38:43.080]  These guys aren't God, they can't do things that are criminally, even if they're running
[38:43.080 --> 38:45.920]  the system and say they can.
[38:45.920 --> 38:48.960]  Under common law under the Constitution, they're just like everybody else.
[38:48.960 --> 38:52.920]  The law applies to them, they're not above the law, but they said it didn't apply because
[38:52.920 --> 38:55.160]  they gave themselves waivers.
[38:55.160 --> 39:11.800]  So in 15 months and three weeks, they have stolen over $28 trillion that we know of.
[39:11.800 --> 39:19.400]  And what, 20 billion or so were bonuses to the little bag men, the technicians, the figure
[39:19.400 --> 39:28.840]  heads, the front men, the big five bank heads and all their vice presidents and minions,
[39:28.840 --> 39:34.480]  the big four brokerage firms and all their minions, their secretaries, I saw reports
[39:34.480 --> 39:43.440]  where secretaries at Goldman Sachs were getting $1 million, $2 million, $3 million bonuses.
[39:43.440 --> 39:58.840]  Everybody gets a bonus of your money, of your tax money.
[39:58.840 --> 40:08.400]  So let's stop talking about the secretary that got $1,400,000, you know, the lowest
[40:08.400 --> 40:11.800]  bonuses I saw were over a million.
[40:11.800 --> 40:16.280]  Let's stop talking about the people that gave themselves $200 million like Paulson.
[40:16.280 --> 40:21.080]  Why aren't we talking about the actual shareholders?
[40:21.080 --> 40:27.760]  Why aren't we talking about the trillions that they won't even say where it went, most
[40:27.760 --> 40:32.560]  of it to offshore banks?
[40:32.560 --> 40:38.640]  That's the big issue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:38.640 --> 40:44.360]  Something emailed to former New York Fed President Timothy Geithner reveals discussion
[40:44.360 --> 40:52.600]  of AIG bailout, something Geithner said he had nothing to do with.
[40:52.600 --> 40:57.040]  And this is only the tip of the iceberg with these emails that Congress is trying to get.
[40:57.040 --> 41:02.360]  They've declared national security in 2008.
[41:02.360 --> 41:04.280]  They engaged in financial terrorism.
[41:04.280 --> 41:09.120]  To me, that's the biggest crime here, to come out and tell Congress, Henry Paulson, the
[41:09.120 --> 41:14.160]  man on television right now, live.
[41:14.160 --> 41:24.640]  We got Senator Inhofe, we got multiple congressmen here on air to tell you that they were threatened
[41:24.640 --> 41:28.780]  with total martial law if they didn't give the banks this power.
[41:28.780 --> 41:36.120]  And then the banks went out on television, Congress still said no in late September.
[41:36.120 --> 41:43.800]  And so in the final days of September, the first two days of October, Paulson and Geithner
[41:43.800 --> 41:53.400]  and Bernanke and Summers and Reuben and Obama and McCain, the whole crew pulled together.
[41:53.400 --> 41:57.640]  Team Tyrant against the American people, people of the world, they all pulled together and
[41:57.640 --> 42:07.040]  came out all over television in a unified five-day blitz and said they didn't vote for
[42:07.040 --> 42:08.040]  the bailout.
[42:08.040 --> 42:11.760]  And if you don't bail us out, there's going to be a depression.
[42:11.760 --> 42:15.920]  And the stock market fell by several thousand points.
[42:15.920 --> 42:22.800]  And I took my kids out to soccer practice that weekend, leading into October 3rd later
[42:22.800 --> 42:23.800]  in the week.
[42:23.800 --> 42:27.640]  And I watched every one of those yuppies with newspapers and their blackberries and their
[42:27.640 --> 42:34.440]  iPhones looking down at them and almost crying, watching their 401Ks go down on average by
[42:34.440 --> 42:37.560]  over 40%.
[42:37.560 --> 42:39.760]  That was financial terrorism.
[42:39.760 --> 42:43.400]  I didn't have a blackberry out looking at stocks because I don't own any stocks.
[42:43.400 --> 42:45.720]  I don't have a 401K.
[42:45.720 --> 42:51.240]  I don't involve myself in all of that gambling, swindling system.
[42:51.240 --> 42:55.920]  Yeah, it made a lot of you out there a lot of money, but at the expense of our country's
[42:55.920 --> 43:00.360]  future and your children's future, it was a casino.
[43:00.360 --> 43:04.560]  And like a rigged casino, they know you were a high-rolling yuppie.
[43:04.560 --> 43:09.600]  You thought you were making $400,000 a year in the last decade.
[43:09.600 --> 43:15.080]  And when you came in, they let you win the first few times at that rigged roulette table
[43:15.080 --> 43:22.000]  with magnets in it and steal the middle of that little white ball.
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.560]  And they could just hit a button and let you win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win,
[43:26.560 --> 43:32.680]  win, win, win, setting you up, cutting the profits off the top of themselves, buying
[43:32.680 --> 43:38.040]  up the media, buying up the defense industries, buying up, getting all our states in debt,
[43:38.040 --> 43:44.240]  jacking up the taxes and regulations, knowing they were going to shut it all off.
[43:44.240 --> 43:46.160]  And I'm going to tell the yuppie something else.
[43:46.160 --> 43:47.280]  Things aren't going to get better.
[43:47.280 --> 43:55.600]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse, but slowly, slow, coordinated destruction
[43:55.600 --> 44:02.000]  of the economy so they can consolidate it.
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.640]  You are going to be ruined by this.
[44:07.640 --> 44:11.240]  We are going to be ruined by this.
[44:11.240 --> 44:17.120]  Time is already exploding, homelessness is exploding, joblessness is exploding.
[44:17.120 --> 44:28.680]  Society is falling apart by design.
[44:28.680 --> 44:34.320]  Geithner takes the hot seated AIG hearing, defends himself, says he knew nothing about
[44:34.320 --> 44:40.480]  money going to Goldman Sachs, says he didn't know that his underlings told them to make
[44:40.480 --> 44:46.400]  it secret when he's all over television previously saying it's a secret I won't tell you.
[44:46.400 --> 44:52.040]  They're caught red handed and now we have the emails that he was calling the shots.
[44:52.040 --> 44:54.040]  Of course he was calling the shots.
[44:54.040 --> 45:04.280]  He was the head of the New York Fed that gave the order.
[45:04.280 --> 45:09.720]  New emails show AIG Mold Bank payment disclosures with Geithner.
[45:09.720 --> 45:15.880]  He lied to Congress, he's a crook.
[45:15.880 --> 45:21.800]  Wall Street Journal, New York Fed told AIG to shield payouts, Geithner emailed AIG with
[45:21.800 --> 45:28.360]  whole details about swap deals with Goldman Sachs and subprime loans.
[45:28.360 --> 45:31.320]  Emails obtained by the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee
[45:31.320 --> 45:35.560]  representative Darrell Issa, support claims that Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's actions
[45:35.560 --> 45:40.600]  in handling the financial crisis and the bankers on Wall Street warrants deeper investigation.
[45:40.600 --> 45:43.400]  Yeah, that's the mainstream media hiding it in plain view.
[45:43.400 --> 45:45.760]  This should be a bigger issue.
[45:45.760 --> 45:49.600]  I mean, they're in trouble, but really Bloomberg's got a blurb.
[45:49.600 --> 45:50.600]  A few others do.
[45:50.600 --> 45:59.160]  This has been out for two days, took me two days to find out about this and we're newshounding.
[45:59.160 --> 46:04.920]  We've got our snout in the news trough looking, rooting.
[46:04.920 --> 46:10.520]  Here's the Wall Street Journal headline today, AIG hearings, Geithner's last stand.
[46:10.520 --> 46:14.720]  That's right.
[46:14.720 --> 46:19.640]  Here's the nation magazine, the big liberal intelligentsia, what do they have to say?
[46:19.640 --> 46:22.840]  Their jumpin' ship.
[46:22.840 --> 46:26.200]  The nation, Geithner must go, their editorial board.
[46:26.200 --> 46:31.960]  The first casualty, the presidential debacle, wasn't a debacle nation, it was all designed,
[46:31.960 --> 46:35.640]  it swindled, coordinated with Clinton, Bush, and then Obama.
[46:35.640 --> 46:39.960]  They started this operation in the late 90s on record.
[46:39.960 --> 46:45.360]  The first casualty, the president's political debacle, will likely be Tim Geithner.
[46:45.360 --> 46:52.040]  The severely overconfident, yeah, arrogant, hubris filled Treasury Secretary, well known
[46:52.040 --> 46:53.840]  as a lapdog of Wall Street.
[46:53.840 --> 46:58.280]  Geithner was effectively repudiated by the president last week when Barack Obama abruptly
[46:58.280 --> 47:03.880]  announced a new, more aggressive approach to financial reform, but the immediate threat
[47:03.880 --> 47:10.880]  to Geithner is the scandal of collusion and possible illegal behavior, gathering around
[47:10.880 --> 47:15.040]  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for its mega-billion dollar takeover of insurance
[47:15.040 --> 47:16.280]  giant AIG.
[47:16.280 --> 47:21.120]  Yeah, they took it over and used it as a conduit to give themselves the bailout money, because
[47:21.120 --> 47:25.320]  they didn't want to give it directly to Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and a bunch of other
[47:25.320 --> 47:28.440]  big banks.
[47:28.440 --> 47:37.240]  Now, Obama has done this before.
[47:37.240 --> 47:44.680]  In February, and we covered it in Obama deception that came out a month later in March, we show
[47:44.680 --> 47:48.400]  the scam.
[47:48.400 --> 47:52.280]  Obama comes out and says, don't worry, I'm really mad at Wall Street and the banker's
[47:52.280 --> 47:54.280]  getting rich and I'm fighting him.
[47:54.280 --> 47:58.520]  Meanwhile, he was completely financed by him, four times the money McCain got from him,
[47:58.520 --> 48:04.720]  completely run by the most Wall Street run presidency ever, and that's saying something.
[48:04.720 --> 48:12.840]  And he said, I'm going to cap CEOs and I'm going to go after bad banks and I'm going
[48:12.840 --> 48:14.120]  to cap their bonuses.
[48:14.120 --> 48:18.640]  And then he signed an executive order that the media literally didn't report on, but
[48:18.640 --> 48:28.160]  we cover it at first, they didn't report on it saying retroactively and into the future
[48:28.160 --> 48:32.960]  on the bailout deal, which goes into perpetuity in the future until we go and stop it in Congress
[48:32.960 --> 48:35.960]  that all the big banks were exempt.
[48:35.960 --> 48:41.720]  Now, then it started coming out in the media when myself and many others exposed it.
[48:41.720 --> 48:46.920]  Lou Rockwell, countless others exposed it, Ron Paul exposed it.
[48:46.920 --> 48:52.280]  So then they threw Senator Dodd under the bus and said, Dodd did this because they got
[48:52.280 --> 48:54.920]  a law passed separately.
[48:54.920 --> 49:00.840]  They said in that supposed stimulus package of the auto bailout, nothing to do with the
[49:00.840 --> 49:03.480]  auto bailout.
[49:03.480 --> 49:09.140]  Most of it was just attaching a bunch of other stuff in there to scam.
[49:09.140 --> 49:12.200]  And it said, oh, except the big banks were exempt from this.
[49:12.200 --> 49:14.440]  And that's what this new banking talk is.
[49:14.440 --> 49:17.240]  I've looked at what they're proposing.
[49:17.240 --> 49:21.880]  And what they've done is, if you're a small town bank that's done business right and you
[49:21.880 --> 49:26.680]  got a couple bankers on the board that made a lot of money the old fashioned way by loaning
[49:26.680 --> 49:30.860]  people money by trying to build up their community, bedrock of the community.
[49:30.860 --> 49:31.860]  We need lending.
[49:31.860 --> 49:33.320]  We need banks locally.
[49:33.320 --> 49:36.280]  They just start sending in regulators controlled by Goldman Sachs.
[49:36.280 --> 49:39.360]  They literally have almost every top position.
[49:39.360 --> 49:44.760]  If they don't, it's JPMorgan Chase or others, they control the regulators and they go in
[49:44.760 --> 49:46.600]  and take over your state bank.
[49:46.600 --> 49:48.800]  They come and take over your rural bank.
[49:48.800 --> 49:54.320]  They come in and take over your farming or local industry bank.
[49:54.320 --> 50:00.400]  They grab WAMU, flush with cash and just eat it.
[50:00.400 --> 50:02.800]  They're pirates.
[50:02.800 --> 50:05.400]  They don't want banks locally loaning to you.
[50:05.400 --> 50:08.320]  That's come out in their documents that they said, well, we're going to have too much inflation
[50:08.320 --> 50:09.960]  of the public actually gets this money.
[50:09.960 --> 50:16.280]  We'll just keep it for ourselves because you won't really see inflation when they're
[50:16.280 --> 50:17.960]  busy buying up depressed real estate.
[50:17.960 --> 50:21.960]  It's one of the little tricks they run.
[50:21.960 --> 50:23.080]  And I'm talking about ports.
[50:23.080 --> 50:25.200]  I'm talking about factories.
[50:25.200 --> 50:27.480]  And then they move them out of the country.
[50:27.480 --> 50:32.680]  The only part of the money in the so-called auto bailout that had nothing to do with that,
[50:32.680 --> 50:37.600]  the only thing it had to do with it was giving billions of dollars to move General Motors
[50:37.600 --> 50:41.560]  to Brazil, Eastern Europe, Russia, and China.
[50:41.560 --> 50:42.560]  Yeah.
[50:42.560 --> 50:43.560]  Yeah.
[50:43.560 --> 50:46.960]  Your tax money to move them out of the country.
[50:46.960 --> 50:57.560]  What you have is just a sickening, unbelievable festering orgy of theft going on and these
[50:57.560 --> 51:01.560]  criminals are going down.
[51:01.560 --> 51:06.400]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high
[51:06.400 --> 51:08.440]  energy and vibrant health?
[51:08.440 --> 51:13.240]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen
[51:13.240 --> 51:14.880]  content of your body.
[51:14.880 --> 51:19.440]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high
[51:19.440 --> 51:21.360]  pH environment.
[51:21.360 --> 51:26.480]  Alchovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[51:26.480 --> 51:31.360]  Using alchovision pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get
[51:31.360 --> 51:34.720]  rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[51:34.720 --> 51:39.280]  Only put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[51:39.280 --> 51:43.840]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[52:02.360 --> 52:06.120]  Residents of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[52:06.120 --> 52:09.240]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[52:09.240 --> 52:13.600]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[52:13.600 --> 52:14.600]  at home.
[52:14.600 --> 52:19.240]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are
[52:19.240 --> 52:20.240]  calling the shots.
[52:20.240 --> 52:25.640]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[52:25.640 --> 52:31.360]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[52:31.360 --> 52:35.720]  a bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[52:35.720 --> 52:38.160]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[52:38.160 --> 52:42.280]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[52:42.280 --> 52:48.200]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[52:48.200 --> 52:49.200]  of the Republic.
[52:49.200 --> 52:54.360]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[52:54.360 --> 53:02.160]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[53:02.160 --> 53:05.000]  Our economy is in great distress.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.600]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[53:08.600 --> 53:14.080]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[53:14.080 --> 53:16.760]  You have auto and home insurance.
[53:16.760 --> 53:19.920]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[53:19.920 --> 53:25.880]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term because it might take years to recover?
[53:25.880 --> 53:31.000]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.120]  times.
[53:33.120 --> 53:38.000]  Survivalistseeds.com is offering a package that will give you a three-acre heirloom vegetable

[53:57.720 --> 53:58.720]  Show.
[53:58.720 --> 54:23.680]  Strange days have found us, oh yes, strange days have trapped us down, they've come to
[54:23.680 --> 54:33.120]  destroy us.
[54:33.120 --> 54:41.040]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[54:41.040 --> 54:49.920]  We're going to sound we'll cast the second, third, and fourth hour today live streaming
[54:49.920 --> 54:56.680]  video, more than just a webcam, multi-cam shoot, document cam, video clips, get to see the
[54:56.680 --> 55:03.880]  research we do live on air as I call for Googling of articles and documents at PrisonPlanet.tv
[55:03.880 --> 55:09.600]  within Archive It for PrisonPlanet.tv members along with thousands of previous shows we've
[55:09.600 --> 55:18.840]  done, all 20 plus of my films, expanded extras from the DVDs only at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[55:18.840 --> 55:26.360]  My book, now out of print, Paul Watson's book, now out of print, old archive shows from over
[55:26.360 --> 55:34.240]  a decade that we've posted there from local access, six years up and running in April.
[55:34.240 --> 55:41.760]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 since the day, 595 a month, get a year membership instead of a monthly
[55:41.760 --> 55:44.920]  trial and get three months free.
[55:44.920 --> 55:47.440]  We always do that Christmas special where you sign up during Christmas, you get five
[55:47.440 --> 55:51.640]  and a half months, but hey, three months free, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[55:51.640 --> 55:58.360]  Okay, what I'm going to do is in the third and fourth hour, we're going to have open
[55:58.360 --> 56:01.720]  phones on the Geithner and Paulson hearings.
[56:01.720 --> 56:06.520]  We're going to get into all the other news, but in the next hour, I want to focus in on
[56:06.520 --> 56:07.520]  the imploding.
[56:07.520 --> 56:14.960]  And when I say imploding, folks, I mean imploding past my wildest dreams.
[56:14.960 --> 56:16.920]  This is unbelievable.
[56:16.920 --> 56:20.640]  This is turning into an absolute complete route.
[56:20.640 --> 56:25.960]  And the headline states it at PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Watson, global warming fraud collapses
[56:25.960 --> 56:30.840]  amidst deception and scandal.
[56:30.840 --> 56:34.040]  I have a giant stack of news I'm going to be covering in the next hour.
[56:34.040 --> 56:37.920]  James Dillingpole will be joining us.
[56:37.920 --> 56:43.160]  He writes for the Times of London, the Sunday Times, the Daily Telegraph, and for the spectator.
[56:43.160 --> 56:50.560]  He's going to be with us for a full hour to chronicle the complete and total implosion
[56:50.560 --> 56:52.720]  and route of these criminals.
[56:52.720 --> 57:00.040]  Now their cult, their Gaia cult, their anti-private property cult, is still operating all over
[57:00.040 --> 57:03.360]  the world, but they are completely discredited.
[57:03.360 --> 57:04.800]  We must route them.
[57:04.800 --> 57:11.840]  But at the international level, the fraud has imploded.
[57:11.840 --> 57:17.480]  Every day, multiple confirmed reports come out of premeditated fraud by the UN and their
[57:17.480 --> 57:21.360]  allied universities in racketeering doing this by design.
[57:21.360 --> 57:26.600]  Every day, four, five, six, huge bombshells that I can't even believe.
[57:26.600 --> 57:29.480]  That dwarf climate gave.
[57:29.480 --> 57:33.400]  Not just them talking about covering stuff up and hiding the decline in temperature and
[57:33.400 --> 57:38.480]  how it's natural, but the UN knowing that man has no effect on the atmosphere, the sun
[57:38.480 --> 57:44.840]  is just unbelievably powerful, the fact that they know the Himalayas aren't melting, the
[57:44.840 --> 57:50.440]  fact that they of course knew that glaciers get bigger in the winter, smaller in the summer,
[57:50.440 --> 57:54.520]  there's a natural contracting and expanding, the fact that they knew there's always an
[57:54.520 --> 58:00.680]  ozone hole naturally over the poles in different times of year, the fact that they know polar
[58:00.680 --> 58:04.320]  bears are exploding in numbers and are the greatest land swimmer.
[58:04.320 --> 58:14.480]  I mean, I didn't need them to tell me that was a fraud saying they couldn't swim.
[58:14.480 --> 58:20.960]  You know, I read all this children education literature because we homeschool and I read
[58:20.960 --> 58:21.960]  read it all.
[58:21.960 --> 58:25.400]  I mean, I read tons of it and it just every one of them states that polar bears are all
[58:25.400 --> 58:28.280]  basically dying and can't swim and that penguins can't swim.
[58:28.280 --> 58:32.960]  I mean, come on, two plus two doesn't equal five, it equals four.
[58:32.960 --> 58:37.040]  These are aquatic birds.
[58:37.040 --> 58:40.800]  Polar bears hunt in the water, we'll be right back.
[58:40.800 --> 58:53.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[58:53.920 --> 58:58.280]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[58:58.280 --> 58:59.280]  do you want?
[58:59.280 --> 59:04.840]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[59:04.840 --> 59:06.320]  Food is your only ammunition.
[59:06.320 --> 59:07.560]  How much do you want?
[59:07.560 --> 59:08.640]  When do you want it?
[59:08.640 --> 59:10.600]  Now or after the battle starts?
[59:10.600 --> 59:11.720]  When will you need it?
[59:11.720 --> 59:13.840]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[59:13.840 --> 59:15.200]  Will there be any food?
[59:15.200 --> 59:16.640]  Will it make your children sick?
[59:16.640 --> 59:20.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[59:20.760 --> 59:21.920]  and be immunized?
[59:21.920 --> 59:25.720]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[59:25.720 --> 59:29.320]  It is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[59:29.320 --> 59:30.560]  How much will you need?
[59:30.560 --> 59:31.560]  We don't know.
[59:31.560 --> 59:32.560]  How much do you want?
[59:32.560 --> 59:33.560]  All you can get.
[59:33.560 --> 59:34.560]  I'm Alex Jones.
[59:34.560 --> 59:37.720]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[59:37.720 --> 59:45.280]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[59:45.280 --> 59:58.800]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[43:33.860 --> 1:00:25.840]  now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:34.240]  After Climate Gate, Pachari Gate, Glacier Gate, Amazon Gate, and you've got Racketeering
[1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:35.240]  Globally.
[1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:40.480]  That document came out two months ago with the UN going and organizing key universities
[1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:42.120]  to engage in fraud.
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:47.120]  We go look at each university, Canada, Australia, the US, New Zealand, England.
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:53.160]  They are all cooking the books, cutting out temperature data that shows that we're cooling
[1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:56.640]  in the last 10 years at least.
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:59.560]  The heating ended 15 years ago.
[1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:02.480]  You've got Pachari making all this money.
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:08.000]  This is unprecedented because the entire globalist agenda for the UN IMF World Bank
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.800]  to set up world taxation and to be able to shut down or curtail any industry that isn't
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:17.840]  part of their inside coterie, it's all imploding.
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:19.760]  But the battle isn't over.
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:21.000]  We've won a lot of big battles.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.240]  We've now got the initiative.
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:25.360]  We can beat them, but they're in sconce.
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:26.360]  They're dug in.
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:29.960]  We're going to have to go house to house with these people in our towns, our cities,
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:34.960]  Swartz and Eggers, organizing governors and mayors to take over locally absolute treason
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:36.920]  and needs to go back to his own country.
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:39.040]  They'll sure kick him out in Austria.
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:43.280]  James Dillingpole writes regularly for the Times of London, the Sunday Times, the Daily
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:44.280]  Telegraph.
[1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:45.520]  He's also a TV critic.
[1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:49.920]  The spectator, he is the author of various novels, including, and we'll tell you about
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:50.920]  some of those.
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:57.840]  Also, well, he's a bestselling author and one of the great analysts breaking down what
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:00.960]  these people are up to will also give you his website.
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:05.760]  This is a short segment, but James, is it safe to say, or let me ask you this question,
[1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:12.520]  is this exploding in their face in an even bigger fashion than you thought Climate Gate
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:13.520]  would originally?
[1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:14.520]  Definitely.
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:17.680]  You know, I thought Christmas had come early with Climate Gate.
[1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:21.560]  It seems that next Christmas has come early as well, but this has been fantastic.
[1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:27.600]  We are having so many scandals, I almost can't keep up with it, but that's the good news.
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:33.200]  The bad news is, as Shakespeare said, we have scotched the snake, but not killed it, and
[1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:34.200]  that's the problem.
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:40.520]  The snake, I think, the great AGW and the Progenic Global Warming Snake, is much more
[1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:41.520]  dangerous now.
[1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:42.520]  It's wounded.
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:48.920]  I think you're going to see all sorts of devious attempts by the IPCC, by the various green
[1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:54.960]  movements to try and trick their way out of the situation, and we've got to be on our
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:55.960]  guard.
[1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:01.600]  They've gone from stonewalling to now the BBC, the age, and others going, there were
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:08.000]  a few bad scientists that meant well because they know how real the problem is, and we
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:13.080]  now see the IPCC head and others saying, well, we did want to make it look worse because
[1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:17.000]  it is a real problem, so now they're saying we lied to save you.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:22.400]  Well, it's interesting, Alex, are you all as familiar with Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the
[1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:28.320]  guy in charge, the beardy guy, he looks a bit like, I call him the troll impersonator.
[1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:30.720]  He looks a bit like Saruman from Lord of the Rings.
[1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:34.560]  Well, he looks like Osama bin Laden's older brother.
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:35.560]  He does, he does.
[1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:36.560]  He's ugly and older brother.
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:37.560]  That's the guy.
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:45.200]  Well, Dr. Pachauri, he's in charge of the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:54.680]  Change, and as you know, he's been exposed for having all sorts of extraordinarily diverse
[1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:56.160]  business connections.
[1:03:56.160 --> 1:03:58.360]  He's heavily involved in carbon trading.
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:02.600]  He's even got an involvement in an oil company, which is kind of weird, given that he's supposed
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:05.720]  to be saving the planet from big oil.
[1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:11.120]  Anyway, he's in it up to the neck in carbon trading, which is the kind of, I think the
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:15.720]  most polite way of putting it is he has certain conflicts of interest.
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:19.560]  Okay, so this has been going on for quite some time.
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:23.160]  He's been exposed by us gallant bloggers.
[1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:29.080]  And who are the guys calling most loudly for his resignation?
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:34.520]  Well, funnily enough, they are the environmentalists.
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:35.520]  Stay there, James.
[1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:40.720]  James Dilling-Pold, a top writer over in England, author, researcher, somebody who's really
[1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:42.520]  been tracking this fraud.
[1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:43.520]  Long segment coming up.
[1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:50.280]  I want to just go through all the new scandals, one by one, each one dwarfing climategate.
[1:04:50.280 --> 1:04:51.600]  Each one more wild.
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:52.600]  And you said it.
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:54.520]  Five or six new scandals a day.

[1:07:00.040 --> 1:07:04.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:13.640]  Number two, our new energies are once to control how much power your electric company allows
[1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:14.640]  you to have.
[1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:20.360]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:24.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:28.680]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:32.160]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:35.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:07:35.880 --> 1:07:40.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:44.400]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:45.800]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:50.040]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:07.480]  Here's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:13.120]  We have the best-selling author of Obama Land.
[1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:16.760]  I have seen the future and it doesn't work.
[1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:23.240]  Journalist, Mr. Dillingpole with us, his website is jamesdillingpole.com and he's with us for
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:24.240]  the rest of the hour.
[1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:30.720]  Now, if you just joined us, we're going to chronicle the aftermath of climate gain.
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:38.960]  And it's kind of like a battle at sea where you torpedo a big ship and it starts exploding
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:45.360]  and burning, but then the magazine, where all of its explosives and artillery shells
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:49.240]  are stored, ignites and the whole ship just blows up.
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:51.640]  Now, they're still in our local towns and cities.
[1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:53.360]  They've invested hundreds of billions.
[1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:59.000]  They're not going to stop, but their capital ship, their main flagship, has completely
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  exploded.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.280]  They are now known as frauds, but they don't care.
[1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:03.800]  They're going to continue on.
[1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:09.880]  So we're going through the UN climate chief who is admitting all these errors in their
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:15.080]  reports, but it's coming out that they, quote, did want to make it look worse so that we
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:17.120]  would accept them saving us.
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:21.680]  And of course, he makes money off shutting down ancient, and I say ancient, some of the
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:29.920]  oldest and best steel mills, forges in England, and the government pays him to then set
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:31.440]  one up in India.
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:34.080]  So this is also a hijacking of industry.
[1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:37.320]  We're, we're, we're covering that scandal first, then we're going to get into all the
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:40.560]  other scandals with Mr. Dillingpole.
[1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:41.560]  Please continue, sir.
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:47.280]  Yeah, we've got Dr. Pichari, who is the bearded trolling person that we talked about earlier.
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:54.680]  And this guy is in charge of the UN body responsible for telling the world that the world is getting
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:55.680]  dangerously hotter.
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:09:57.440]  It's all man's sport.
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:09:59.520]  We must spend lots and lots of money.
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:02.440]  We must increase regulation.
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:09.560]  We must have carbon credits, carbon controls, and lo and behold, what is this guy doing?
[1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:14.640]  He happens to have involvement in the carbon trading industry.
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:18.800]  This carbon trading industry, which was invented, of course, by Ken Lay of Enron.
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:24.640]  This guy has got connections with the Chicago Carbon Exchange, which of course is, his sharehold
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:27.720]  has include Goldman Sachs and Al Gore.
[1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:32.800]  So, you know, the net broadens are a lot of, there are a lot of very rich people and organizations
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:39.280]  who are involved in this massive scam and, and so Pichari Gate, as we call it, is this
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:44.240]  guy being exposed as being compromised, let us say.
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:50.120]  Then after Pichari Gate, we get this thing called Glacier Gate.
[1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:58.040]  It turns out that the, the United Nations, the IPCC's fourth assessment report, you know,
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:05.560]  supposed to be, supposed to be the most accurate, up-to-date, most scientifically reliable report
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:12.760]  on the street, on the state of the planet, climate-wise, tells us that the world's glaciers
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:14.760]  could be gone by 2035.
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:22.480]  Now 2035 is not very far away, is it, and so that's kind of quite a scary prospect.
[1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:27.280]  Could it be that, that man's evil work has been melting out glaciers so quickly they're
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:29.600]  going to be gone by 2035?
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:30.600]  Well guess what?
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:32.920]  No, it isn't true at all.
[1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:37.000]  It turns out that this report got its figures wrong.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.600]  The actual figure it should have quoted was 2350.
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:43.560]  That's a difference of, I don't know, huge of the math.
[1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:47.560]  It's over 200 years, isn't it?
[1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:54.600]  And how did the IPCC, which is supposed to be the work of, what is it, 2000 expert scientists
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:12:01.320]  in their field, two and a half thousand peer-reviewed scientists whittled, how come this mistake
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:03.640]  got slipped into this reliable report?
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:10.840]  Well, it turns out that the IPCC plays pretty fast and loose with its scientific fact.
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:17.280]  It got this from a magazine article in New Scientist.
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:22.520]  Where did New Scientist get this information from about the glaciers melting by 2035?
[1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:29.480]  It got this information from a conversation on a mobile phone with an Indian chap who
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:32.480]  has since admitted that he made a terrible mistake.
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:37.680]  Now, funny, isn't it, that the IPCC never bothered to check up on this mistake?
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:44.560]  This is the reliable, they keep using this word robust, the IPCC repair-reviewed process
[1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:45.560]  is robust.
[1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:51.840]  Well, I'm sorry, but this is anything but robust, this is climate fraud.
[1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:56.800]  Now James Dillingpole investigating this for major publications in England and the United
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:04.880]  States, we know that when they have this mantra of, but it's peer-reviewed, it's peer-reviewed,
[1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:14.160]  ignore climate gate and one of the main climate facilities used by the UN at East Anglia, England,
[1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:17.000]  ignore the fact that they are trying to hide decline.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:21.640]  We have all these other scientists all peer-reviewed, but when you look at it, they are all using
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:28.440]  the data collated at that university and three or four others who are all in the emails lying
[1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:35.800]  together and then we go and look at the temperature measurements with NASA and with New Zealand
[1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:43.400]  and with everybody, it's all fraud, it's all lies and their peer-reviewed journals are
[1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:44.680]  somebody on a cell phone.
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:48.680]  I mean, you know, you could just call into the UN and say, Martians are going to land
[1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:50.760]  if we don't put taxes on gasoline.
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:53.560]  Oh, that's it, peer-reviewed, put it in there.
[1:13:53.560 --> 1:13:55.240]  Yep, that's absolutely right.
[1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:59.480]  I think whenever you hear somebody use the phrase peer-reviewed, you should reach for
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:08.120]  your browning because peer-reviewed, I'm sorry to say, is a bankrupt notion since climate
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:13.040]  gates because what the climate gate emails from the University of East Anglia showed
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:19.560]  quite clearly was that the scientists at the heart of this process are shutting out of
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:23.400]  the peer-reviewed process, any scientist who disagree with them.
[1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:30.240]  So it's not a question of the pursuit of scientific truth, it's not to do with the
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:36.360]  open sharing of information and the replacement of one hypothesis by another hypothesis, which
[1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:40.640]  is the way that traditionally, science has advanced through the ages, otherwise we'd
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:42.320]  be still thinking the world was flat.
[1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:47.160]  But in the new science, you're not allowed to question Al Gore, he says it's settled,
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:53.080]  that's the end of it, but isn't it worse, sir, because they're not just only allowing
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:15:00.320]  a small intergroup to produce these fake studies that have been proven to all be absolute fraud,
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:05.840]  they will never release the data, and now because the data is being forced to be released,
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:10.800]  we find out when you actually go to Russia or go to China or go to the United States
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:15.880]  or go to South America that the numbers they use from the temperature measurements are
[1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:18.880]  absolute frauds every time you spot check.
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:23.800]  I mean, this needs to be fully audited, but again, the UN and all the major governments
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:26.880]  are behind this, so how do you let the crooks audit themselves?
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:33.480]  Well, I know, I mean, everything, the fantastic report released today by Joseph DeLeo, who
[1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:39.320]  is a meteorologist and Anthony Watts of the famous What's Up with That website, it's
[1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:40.320]  fantastic.
[1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:48.120]  It says, surface temperature records, policy-driven deception, and what it argues, this very thorough
[1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:56.440]  report, is that the surface data records from the last century or so are so corrupt
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:16:03.160]  and unreliable that we cannot even be sure that any global warming whatsoever has taken
[1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:05.560]  place in the last century or so.
[1:16:05.560 --> 1:16:07.720]  And they've got a lot of tricks too.
[1:16:07.720 --> 1:16:09.680]  All over the world, this is on record now.
[1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:12.160]  We posted the mainstream articles where they admit it.
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:17.120]  In the last 20 years, these funded groups have set up their own reading systems or they
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:26.600]  have contracted with airports or they've contracted with weather centers on top of buildings,
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:30.760]  where they know the temperature is going to be many degrees hotter, and that's another
[1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:31.760]  way.
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:35.640]  It's called the urban heat island effect.
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:43.720]  What this means is that the weather sites, you know, where temperatures have been measured
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:49.440]  around the world, originally they were built maybe on the edge of town, and as civilisation,
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:57.520]  as cities have grown in size, so the area surrounding the weather gauge has become more
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:16:58.520]  and more built up.
[1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:00.520]  Some of these things are cited near airports.
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:06.160]  So what this means is that inevitably, the record, the temperature records they're keeping
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:13.360]  have been distorted by the urban heat island effect of the cities because cities are warmer
[1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:14.360]  than the country outside.
[1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:15.360]  That's how it works.
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:23.360]  So how are we to trust these records which show that the earth is getting warmer, when
[1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:30.360]  it may simply be the result of the urban heat island effect, but that's not all.
[1:17:30.360 --> 1:17:40.960]  What happened in the sometime between the 1970s and the 1990s is that they vastly reduced
[1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:48.960]  the number of weather stations used to compile the world's temperature data records.
[1:17:48.960 --> 1:17:56.760]  And what they generally did, these organisations like NASA and the Climate Research Unit, was
[1:17:56.760 --> 1:18:04.760]  that they cherry-picked the temperature data sites that suited their cause.
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:11.280]  They ignored the ones that higher latitudes and higher altitudes, and they concentrated
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:16.600]  on the ones which would show that the world was getting warmer, and then kind of took
[1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:17.600]  an average.
[1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:22.760]  Now, inevitably, what happened is that you saw this upward tick in the graph, which is
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:26.400]  exactly what they want, because an upward tick in the graph shows that the world is
[1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:31.840]  getting warmer, it must be man-made, and action must be taken.
[1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:35.600]  But the Russians and others came out and exposed that, and they've now been forced to admit
[1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:40.520]  that they did indeed do that, they would just take the warmer southern areas and create
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:46.240]  an average for the entire country, for the frozen north as well, the frozen northern
[1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:52.360]  areas of Russia, Siberia and many other areas, of course, they're a lot colder than southern
[1:18:52.360 --> 1:18:53.360]  Russia.
[1:18:53.360 --> 1:18:58.880]  I mean, this is bonafide fraud, and what climate gate proves is they're all coordinating
[1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:00.840]  with each other to engage in fraud.
[1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:08.720]  Yes, it is, I have to say, a conspiracy on a very, very large scale, and it unites some
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:15.320]  oddly disparate groups, because on the one hand, you've got the yoghurt weaving eco-loons,
[1:19:15.320 --> 1:19:23.680]  the green activists, who have found themselves in this weird, unholy alliance with big oil,
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:31.600]  big banks, you know, Rothschilds, Goldman Sachs, in alliance with the technocrats of
[1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:39.440]  the European Union, in alliance with scientists at various government-funded institutions.
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:45.240]  It's a very strange and broad coalition campaigning for this.
[1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:49.400]  Well the communists always work for the banks, in every case we find that, because the big
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:54.360]  banks don't want freedom, in many cases they want monopolies, and a gang of machine gun
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:19:56.200]  toting hippies can deliver it.
[1:19:56.200 --> 1:20:01.400]  We'll be right back with our guest, stay with us.
[1:20:01.400 --> 1:20:05.000]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  filtration.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:10.320]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers,

[1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:27.720]  cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides
[1:20:27.720 --> 1:20:28.720]  and pesticides.

[1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:02.480]  Gold isn't for you.
[1:21:02.480 --> 1:21:06.440]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious
[1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:07.760]  metal investing firms.
[1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:08.760]  I get it.
[1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:12.440]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the
[1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:17.000]  Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security would
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:18.200]  be there for you.
[1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:19.440]  That's not what's happening.
[1:21:19.440 --> 1:21:24.280]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the
[1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:27.880]  dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:31.320]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:35.680]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:41.600]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[1:21:41.600 --> 1:21:44.960]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:45.960]  You should, too.
[1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:46.960]  Find out what they know.
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:50.120]  Call us, and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.

[1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:54.120]  That's 800-686-2237.
[1:21:54.120 --> 1:22:06.080]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:09.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:13.560]  These are finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[1:22:13.560 --> 1:22:14.560]  at home.
[1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:19.720]  We have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[1:22:19.720 --> 1:22:20.720]  shots.
[1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:25.560]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:28.840]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:34.680]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:35.680]  world government.
[1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:36.680]  Tim Geithner?
[1:22:36.680 --> 1:22:37.680]  Bernanke?
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:38.680]  They're arsonists.
[1:22:38.680 --> 1:22:42.200]  There are no more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:47.600]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:49.440]  a fall of the Republic.

[1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:05.680]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief
[1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:10.680]  company, don't greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[1:23:34.320 --> 1:23:35.600]  Herb K was right.

[1:23:52.280 --> 1:24:08.920]  888-352-7726 James Dillingpole.com, that's his website bestselling
[1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:16.360]  author on Obama land, where this for the rest of the hour is we chronicle all of the fraud
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:21.280]  coming out and the fact that they're now capitulating because they know the stonewalling
[1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:22.440]  is backfired on them.
[1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:27.960]  Now they're saying, yes, we did make it more severe than it is to convince you that you
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:32.960]  need to be saved by us, but it still is bad.
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:40.240]  And I got quote after quote, they're basically saying that and it's coming out that Al Gore
[1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:41.240]  is making all this money.
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:46.040]  The Rothschilds own one of the big carbon trading scams, Pacharis hooked up with all
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:47.240]  of them.
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:51.960]  Another IPCC scientist reveals how you and scientists talked about trying to make the
[1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:58.240]  IPCC report so dramatic that the U.S. would just have to sign Kyoto protocol.
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:01.640]  That's in mainstream news, even CNN's reporting that.
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:06.280]  The BBC's having to admit that there's problems, I mean, they wouldn't report on Climate
[1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:08.280]  Gate for what, three weeks after it broke?
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:09.280]  That's right.
[1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:17.200]  Yeah, I think what you're going to see happening next Alex is that there's going to be a period
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:24.840]  of retrenchment where all the warmest companies say, okay, hands up, you know, we admit there
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:28.080]  may have been a few mistakes and you know what they're going to do next?
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:32.800]  They will chuck Pacharis off the back of the sledge to the walls and they will hope that
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:39.680]  while the walls devour Pacharis, the sledge can move on through the snow and they'll escape.
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:41.040]  It ain't going to happen.
[1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:44.280]  We are going to, we will not allow it to happen.
[1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:49.040]  Same thing on Banker Gate with Geithner and Bernacke, there's no way they're getting out
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:50.040]  of this now.
[1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:54.720]  Well, I would sincerely hope not, I mean, you know, these are, these are bad guys doing
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:55.720]  that.
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:57.720]  But that's what I mean, chunking them overboard isn't going to be enough.
[1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:00.080]  I mean, people are really starting to get it.
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:04.880]  Yeah, I, you know, Alex, I think something incredible is going on right now.
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:07.960]  I mean, I really feel like we're part of a really exciting movement.
[1:26:07.960 --> 1:26:10.560]  We are storming the Bastille.
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:16.680]  The Berlin Wall is coming down and we, the people, are definitely winning against the
[1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:17.680]  forces of darkness.
[1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:22.640]  But, having said that, although it is an exciting revolutionary moment, and it's really great
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:26.920]  to be part of this wonderful, you know, popular uprising, which incidentally supported by
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:32.800]  the US opinion polls, it was in the latest Pew opinion survey, which shows that Americans
[1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:37.800]  are less interested than ever in the idea of man-made global warming.
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:41.240]  And they just don't believe it anymore, they think the whole thing stinks.
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:47.360]  So, the people are on side, but unfortunately what you have is government, you have big
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:54.840]  oil, you have a lot of the, you know, the big capitalist companies, you have, you know,
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:56.480]  the European technocrats, you have some...
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:59.200]  But see, but see James, that shows the hopes.
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:03.760]  Almost all of big oil has been aligned for over a decade because they're controlled by
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:04.760]  the big banks.
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:08.120]  So, they want this new derivative scam.
[1:27:08.120 --> 1:27:09.120]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:12.120]  The world economy has gone to pot.
[1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:17.600]  They need a new revenue stream, what better than to invent this wonderful new thing, which
[1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:21.360]  is the empire's new clothes of global trading, and that is carbon trading.
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:23.680]  It is trading, it's thin air, it's environmental economics.
[1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:27.600]  Well, I want to talk about that when we come back, but when I first talked to you off air,
[1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:29.720]  you used the analogy of the Battle of the Bulge.
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:30.720]  I'm afraid so.
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:34.040]  I think we can't talk enough about Hitler where the Green Movement is concerned, because
[1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:38.160]  the Nazis were the first Greens, really.
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:42.200]  And I think that what's going to happen next is that we're going to get our Battle of the
[1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:48.600]  Bulge moment where the bad guys start coming back at us in force, you know, surprising.
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:55.840]  We think we've won, but no, they've got a lot more up their sleeve just yet.
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:27:57.400]  So how do you see this unfolding?
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:27:58.960]  They're already slunching new things.
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:01.240]  The ocean's going to turn into pure acid.
[1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:06.640]  So many, yeah, that will definitely be one of their, you know, I reckon that little by
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:12.960]  little they will start abandoning the global warming lie, and they will move on to something
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:13.960]  else.
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:19.960]  Because it's obviously very important for them to portray carbon dioxide as the bad guy
[1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:20.960]  in all this.
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:24.080]  You know, the fact is that carbon dioxide is plant food.
[1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:29.120]  Plants grow more easily the more carbon dioxide there is in the atmosphere, and that's why
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:37.400]  when you get industrial farming, you get these greenhouses pumped with considerably greater
[1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:42.240]  quantities of CO2 than we have in our atmosphere right now.
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:47.680]  So if they can't show that carbon dioxide is causing global warming, how do they still
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:49.560]  go on painting it as the bad guy?
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:55.320]  Well, their next move is to talk about ocean acidification, you know, that it causes ocean
[1:28:55.320 --> 1:28:59.800]  acidification, and this is going to be a massive disaster for our seas.
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:00.800]  Now, it's-
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:04.200]  And that's another trick, because the ocean is acid, it's carbolic.
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:05.200]  Yes.
[1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:11.920]  Well, also what you find is that the ecosystem deals with this sort of problem quite naturally.
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:17.520]  It's not going to create ecological disaster, but keeping up with these guys, with these
[1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:22.920]  slippery, you know, it's like trying to wrestle an eel covered in, you know, in mud.
[1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:25.080]  I mean, how do you do it?
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:32.400]  How do you keep up with these new fat toys that keep being produced by the woman?
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:33.400]  Stay there.
[1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:34.400]  Let's continue to break that down.
[1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:36.680]  Let's get into some of the other scandals.
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:43.720]  Recap the criminal investigations with Climate Gate, Copenhagen falling apart, what Prince
[1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:45.320]  Charles is up to.
[1:29:45.320 --> 1:29:47.720]  It's all coming up with our guest, James Dillingpole.
[1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:51.280]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[1:29:51.280 --> 1:29:52.560]  We're on the march.
[1:29:52.560 --> 1:29:58.960]  The Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:04.080]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:30:04.080 --> 1:30:08.420]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:30:08.420 --> 1:30:09.420]  do you want?
[1:30:09.420 --> 1:30:14.960]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:16.460]  Food is your only ammunition.
[1:30:16.460 --> 1:30:17.680]  How much do you want?
[1:30:17.680 --> 1:30:18.760]  When do you want it?
[1:30:18.760 --> 1:30:20.720]  Now or after the battle starts?
[1:30:20.720 --> 1:30:21.840]  When will you need it?
[1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:23.960]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:25.320]  Will there be any food?
[1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:26.760]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:30:26.760 --> 1:30:30.920]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:30:30.920 --> 1:30:32.060]  and be immunized?
[1:30:32.060 --> 1:30:35.840]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:30:35.840 --> 1:30:39.440]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:30:39.440 --> 1:30:40.680]  How much will you need?
[1:30:40.680 --> 1:30:41.680]  We don't know.
[1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:42.680]  How much do you want?
[1:30:42.680 --> 1:30:43.680]  All you can get.
[1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:44.680]  I'm Alex Jones.

[1:31:59.800 --> 1:32:04.440]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:08.760]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:32:08.760 --> 1:32:13.080]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:32:13.080 --> 1:32:14.400]  allows you to have.
[1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:15.400]  It's true.
[1:32:15.400 --> 1:32:20.120]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:24.440]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:28.440]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:32:28.440 --> 1:32:31.920]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:35.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:32:35.640 --> 1:32:40.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:44.160]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:45.560]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:49.800]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:32:49.800 --> 1:32:51.400]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[1:33:12.920 --> 1:33:19.920]  I'm going to break down all the other big hoaxes coming up in the next hour.
[1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:25.200]  You know, we told you back in 2002, we'd gotten all the details then, that it was the most
[1:33:25.200 --> 1:33:29.560]  weaponized U.S. grade anthrax ever seen.
[1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:42.200]  Now, eight years later, the Wall Street Journal, Washington Times reporting it was the most
[1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:49.440]  super weaponized U.S. and that Fort Dietrich couldn't even do it.
[1:33:49.440 --> 1:33:50.960]  But that it is U.S. designed.
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:55.680]  Now, they claim that a couple different people made this in a bucket in their basement, ladies
[1:33:55.680 --> 1:33:58.680]  and gentlemen.
[1:33:58.680 --> 1:34:00.360]  Anthrax made it in the basement.
[1:34:00.360 --> 1:34:03.360]  Very rarely we'll even get somebody sick.
[1:34:03.360 --> 1:34:06.920]  The trick is actually getting them infected, getting it into their lungs.
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:11.560]  This stuff was super miniaturized, I mean, the list goes on and on.
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:12.560]  That's coming up.
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:18.080]  I also want to get into Oliver Stone's suggest, Hitler is easy scapegoat.
[1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:19.080]  What does that deal with?
[1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:23.440]  Well, he's got a new 10-part documentary, The Secret History of the U.S. coming out,
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:29.360]  where they actually do get into how big banks financed the Nazis to a great extent, but
[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.120]  he's not telling you that they also financed the communists.
[1:34:32.120 --> 1:34:35.000]  The truth is, big banks end up financing everybody.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.720]  It really seems that there's a boogeyman in the center of the universe, it's these institutions.
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:42.760]  They're just designed for fraud.
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:45.680]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:50.280]  There's a potential false flag attack to be blamed on Muslims foiled, got a report there.
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:56.240]  Also in England, they're saying airline passengers have no right to refuse naked body scanners.
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:58.080]  So we're going to be covering that.
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:02.000]  Schwarzenegger says, send inmates to Mexico, pretty soon they'll just send us to Devils
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:06.560]  Island like the French did, but that is all coming up and your phone calls in the next
[1:35:06.560 --> 1:35:07.560]  hour.
[1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:12.000]  Going back to James Dillingpole, who's a writer for the Times of London, Sunday Times of London,
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:18.240]  The Daily Telegraph, The Spectator, and best-selling author, of course, of Obama Land.
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:21.880]  I have seen your future and it doesn't work.
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:24.200]  So and he wrote that right when Obama got into office.
[1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:25.200]  He's certainly been proven right.
[1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:29.880]  So we've been proven right with the Obama deception and fall the Republic at those DVDs
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:34.080]  and keep educating folks as we are starting to route these people at infowars.com.
[1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:38.480]  Okay, James, getting back now, I've been asking a lot of questions, but I want to get into
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:44.080]  that other, you're a wellspring of knowledge on these issues, how you see them counter-attacking,
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:47.680]  how they're trying to buttress themselves by giving each other awards, Prince Charles
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:53.520]  going and visiting the main nest of criminals.
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:59.240]  What happened with Climate Gate, the new investigations in hindsight, what Climate Gate blowing up
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:05.920]  the Copenhagen fraud did to the move for the EU-wide global dictatorship, James Dillingpole,
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:06.920]  break it down.
[1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:14.280]  Well, Alex, I had a very depressing lunch on New Year's Day with a distant member of
[1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:20.280]  my family and it turns out that he's now working for something called the European Climate
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:21.280]  Foundation.
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:27.840]  And the European Climate Foundation is one of those charitable bodies which is pumping
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:37.480]  in a lot, lot, lot of money into funding climate change advocacy groups, it is up to the neck,
[1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:43.360]  it was there at Copenhagen at the negotiating table, staying in all the best hotels and
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:49.200]  I asked him whether Climate Gate, which as you remember broke during the, the story broke
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:57.760]  during the beginning of the Copenhagen, Libtard Fest and I said, how's Climate Gate
[1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:04.280]  had any effect whatsoever on the negotiation process and do you know what he said, it didn't
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:05.280]  even register.
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:10.760]  He said, as far as we were concerned, the process moves on, we don't really care what
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:16.040]  other people say, all that matters is the process and this I'm afraid is what we're
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:22.680]  going to see throughout the world, we're going to see big government ignoring the arguments
[1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:29.160]  against manmade global warming completely and carrying on with the legislation on carbon,
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:32.160]  carrying on with the taxing.
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:36.800]  The reason this scam is so dangerous is I keep trying to remind, I blog about this every
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:42.560]  day for the telegraph in London and some people say to me, why do you keep going on and on
[1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:43.560]  about this subject?
[1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:45.920]  Why can't you talk about something else?
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:49.920]  Because it's, I mean, I want to hear your answer, but it's a takeover of society, it's
[1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:55.640]  a cult, you've got common purpose and others funded by this EU group.
[1:37:55.640 --> 1:38:03.160]  Here locally in Austin, they reported last year that a CIA attached special forces colonel
[1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:08.920]  is running for the city, the green movement, they're taking property, they're implementing
[1:38:08.920 --> 1:38:11.760]  Swartz and Eggers getting the governors and mayors together.
[1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:18.240]  And so I think what you're saying here is this is literally a collectivist cult of robbers
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:21.680]  and they're brainwashing our kids, they're not going to stop.
[1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:25.920]  They've got kids riding fake tickets in England and the US and the New York times, climate
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:29.560]  cops, they've got TV shows about reporting on your neighbors.
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:31.560]  The point is this is the Bolsheviks.
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:38.360]  I would say Alex, that it is no exaggeration at all to say that the green movement is more
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:42.560]  dangerous than the communist movement or even the Nazi movement.
[1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:48.520]  And the reason is that, okay, we have to fight a terrible war to defeat Nazism, but the point
[1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:53.160]  was that the threat of Nazism was essentially military.
[1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:58.240]  We defeated the Soviets as well through a combination of proxy wars and effectively Ronald
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:02.920]  Reagan bankrupted them, didn't he, through the Star Wars program.
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:07.280]  The green movement is more dangerous in a way because it is more insidious.
[1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:14.400]  It is not confronting us through military means, it is presenting itself as this caring
[1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:21.400]  movement which only a heartless, nature-hating, evil person could possibly disagree with.
[1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:25.800]  And that is why it presents a problem to those of us who understand it's true menace.
[1:39:25.800 --> 1:39:34.200]  How do we show to the world at large that this movement threatens our society, threatens
[1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:38.160]  our freedoms, threatens everything we believe in?
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:43.200]  It's a big problem because a lot of the people involved in the green movement are cuddly,
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:45.840]  polar bear loving, caring people.
[1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:48.600]  They're not nasty people.
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:54.400]  And it is a constant struggle fighting against their arguments.
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:57.720]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[1:39:57.720 --> 1:40:02.480]  And I mean, I have the New York Times, I have the LA Times, I see it where I live, I see
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:04.920]  the textbooks.
[1:40:04.920 --> 1:40:06.560]  I put my children in a...
[1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:12.720]  For example, my daughter started doing, having choir lessons at Christmas.
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:17.040]  And one of the songs they sang was that lovely song about the snowman, which is very nice.
[1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:21.280]  And another of the songs was called, When Will We Learn?
[1:40:21.280 --> 1:40:27.720]  And it went on and on about, you know, when will we learn to be, to stop being so horrible
[1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:31.960]  to nature, humans are evil, you know, we must save the planet.
[1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:34.680]  The kids are brainwashed, you know.
[1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:35.680]  And let me stop you.
[1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:39.960]  Let me stop you because I was about to say, I put my kids in private school for one year
[1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:43.880]  and even a Christian private school, it was all government approved brainwashing.
[1:40:43.880 --> 1:40:46.240]  We try to even buy home school or material.
[1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:52.360]  Most of it has the brainwashing and they chant these songs in the public schools.
[1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:57.840]  They have the kids go home and write fake tickets and reports on their parents.
[1:40:57.840 --> 1:40:59.160]  Don't take a hot bath.
[1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:01.240]  Don't run the water while you brush your teeth.
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:02.880]  Everyone has nothing to do with the environment.
[1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:03.880]  That's the thing.
[1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:04.880]  They say, well, it's to save the earth.
[1:41:04.880 --> 1:41:10.640]  No, these are coal-hearted, uh, tacticians at the top that want to create a anti-human
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:15.920]  guilt to make humanity the enemy so the collectivist can run the state.
[1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:16.920]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:21.640]  I mean, it is very much like the Hitler Youth being encouraged to report on their parents.
[1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:29.520]  Um, uh, you know, my son is one of the most expensive, um, most highly rated private,
[1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:36.160]  uh, prep schools in the country and even he gets the eco-propaganda and one of the reasons
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:40.760]  he gets this, this eco-propaganda, um, and the school is actually designated itself an
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:41.760]  eco-school.
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:47.480]  The reason it does so is because half the middle-class mothers, uh, actually like, like
[1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:51.680]  this nonsense, they like to hear that the school is, is an eco-school and that teaches
[1:41:51.680 --> 1:41:52.680]  their children as well.
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:57.720]  It's because it, it has become a fashionable agenda for the, what we call the chattering
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:02.360]  classes, you know, the yummy mummies, uh, all these nice, you know, high-earning middle-class
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:03.360]  people.
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:06.040]  They too subscribe to the organic movement.
[1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:07.040]  They too.
[1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:08.040]  Let me go further.
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:09.280]  Mark Dice is a reporter who I know.
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:16.440]  He went out last week in San Diego and over 90% of the people he talked to, it was mainly
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:22.800]  women, young women and middle-class, middle-aged women, they, all the women, except for one
[1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:28.960]  old lady said ban free speech, he had a fake petition saying ban free speech, arrest anybody
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:30.600]  that disagrees with Obama.
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:35.000]  It's time to shut these people up and they would sign it, put their name, their info.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:41.280]  Uh, I mean, they are ready and they think we run society, we're good.
[1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:48.400]  And so now it's a Nazi slash Soviet movement run by a bunch of useful idiot women.
[1:42:48.400 --> 1:42:55.560]  Useful idiot, well, well-paid or well, well-paid husbands, middle-class women, yeah, exactly.
[1:42:55.560 --> 1:43:01.560]  With all, with all these wonderful, uh, lifestyles and they want to reintroduce eco fascism to
[1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:02.560]  the world.
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:03.560]  It is very, very scary.
[1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:06.240]  Well, I didn't mean to interrupt you about your kids.
[1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:11.400]  It's just that we're all having this experience of living in a more and more Orwellian system
[1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:15.800]  where our children are denouncing us and, and, and, and, you know, literally right out
[1:43:15.800 --> 1:43:21.800]  of 1984 and, and we see it, this will lead to North Korea if they win.
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:25.400]  Well, this is, this is what, what, what, of course, Jenna Goldberg talks about in liberal
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:26.400]  fascism.
[1:43:26.400 --> 1:43:32.120]  Fascist movements, uh, throughout the 20th century and the same applies to, to, uh, communist
[1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:34.640]  movements in the 20th, 20th century.
[1:43:34.640 --> 1:43:40.480]  What they needed was a cause, a cause so great that it required government to step in and
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:46.560]  override individual freedom because this cause was so important that only mass government
[1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:48.440]  action could deal with it.
[1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:56.600]  And of course, with, with, uh, environmentalism, they have the perfect excuse to ride roughshot
[1:43:56.600 --> 1:44:06.040]  over democracy, to, to, uh, to deny, uh, voters the right to choose who government, who governs
[1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:13.040]  them because this cause is so important, but only the United Nations, uh, uh, only world
[1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:16.040]  government can really save us from this menace.
[1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:17.040]  This is what we're up against.
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:19.200]  But didn't that backfire on them for decades?
[1:44:19.200 --> 1:44:23.160]  I'd read UN club of Rome saying they were going to set up a world government that we'd
[1:44:23.160 --> 1:44:25.880]  pay taxes to them and they said, oh, you're crazy.
[1:44:25.880 --> 1:44:26.880]  That doesn't exist.
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:27.880]  I'm like, but I have your own book.
[1:44:27.880 --> 1:44:32.160]  I have your own, I have your own biological diversity assessment in 1996.
[1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:36.360]  So they stonewalled, but now they come out and go, world government's here to save you,
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:38.680]  to save the penguins, the polar bears.
[1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:42.880]  That I think that's another reason they're so discredited is they're so full of hubris
[1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:44.080]  and arrogance.
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:47.040]  They think they can just sit up there and say, the science is settled.
[1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:49.320]  World government will save you people.
[1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:53.280]  People fundamentally, even if they're dumbed down, no, science has never settled.
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:55.360]  That's what the scientific methods all about.
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:44:56.360]  People know.
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:45:00.840]  We can never mention often enough the involvement of Morris Strong, who is one of the, one of
[1:45:00.840 --> 1:45:03.200]  the great believers in world government.
[1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:06.760]  He now lives in China, of course, which is his spiritual home.
[1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:13.240]  Morris Strong, a great advocate of world government, who is also heavily exposed to the carbon
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:14.240]  trading industry.
[1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:15.400]  And guess what?
[1:45:15.400 --> 1:45:21.640]  He was the guy who was in charge of the first great eco summit, the Rio summit.
[1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:23.920]  That was Morris Strong's baby.
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:28.200]  And he said, isn't it our job to destroy industrial society?
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:32.400]  And now, literally every day, I see other UN scientists quoting him.
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:33.400]  Yes.
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:34.400]  Yeah.
[1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:35.400]  Absolutely.
[1:45:35.400 --> 1:45:38.400]  And you know, I mean, we were talking about science just a moment ago.
[1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:41.080]  I mean, are you aware of the concept of post-normal science?
[1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:42.080]  Yes.
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:48.800]  Post-normal science is the idea that the new science no longer looks for any kind of objective
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:49.800]  truth.
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:55.400]  It no longer looks at the data and draws conclusions from the data.
[1:45:55.400 --> 1:46:01.560]  Instead, post-normal science is about science twisted to a particular cause.
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:05.560]  In this case, of course, the cause of man-made global warming.
[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:09.520]  These scientists have decided, okay, man-made global warming exists.
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:11.080]  We're not going to look at any more evidence.
[1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:15.560]  We've decided it definitely, definitely exists because all our theoretical models show it
[1:46:15.560 --> 1:46:17.080]  does, so it must do.
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:20.520]  So what we're going to do from now on is not look at any more raw evidence.
[1:46:20.520 --> 1:46:25.520]  What we're going to do is tamper with the evidence so that it supports our cause.
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:27.600]  This is the new science.
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:34.520]  Well I do believe in a creator, but I mean, is it not beautiful that it got so much colder
[1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:39.040]  right as their 25-year plan, at least that old?
[1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:41.440]  It's fantastic, Alex.
[1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:47.000]  You know, we don't have as much money on our side as the opposition does.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  My God, we don't.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:54.560]  But one thing we do have on the side is Mother Gaia, or rather the weather.
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:59.040]  The weather is really supporting our cause in big time.
[1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:03.600]  I think you've been having pretty cold time in America, haven't you?
[1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:09.280]  We've had our first major snow, our first major snow in years, and it's been glorious
[1:47:09.280 --> 1:47:16.320]  to listen to the BBC and the Met Office and the CRU and all these other people who've
[1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:21.520]  been pushing this man-made global warming thing, suddenly trying to have to defend themselves
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:27.160]  against the fact that outside you've got pretty much polar conditions, you know, and so they
[1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:32.320]  have to come up with these phrases like, weather is not the same as climate, and this is the
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:37.160]  kind of extreme weather we can expect to look forward to in the future under global warming.
[1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:40.680]  And people are saying, well, if it's warming, how come it's cold?
[1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:43.200]  And they say, well, you don't understand the science.
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:45.520]  You see, the science is blah, blah, blah.
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:46.520]  It's great.
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:51.760]  And they said that their peer-reviewed journals were bulletproof, and every time they're examined,
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:56.560]  every time they will release the data, which is always very suspicious in science, we find
[1:47:56.560 --> 1:47:58.040]  them making mistakes.
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:00.040]  No, it's fraud.
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:03.640]  Now, and of course, the mistakes are always towards saying it would be warm.
[1:48:03.640 --> 1:48:08.480]  It's never the other way, totally premeditated as the Climate Gate document show, but you
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:10.200]  talked about the enemy within.
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:17.560]  I wanted to read Marcus Satulius Cicero, Roman philosopher and historian, a nation can survive
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:23.400]  its fools, and even the ambitious, but it cannot survive treason from within.
[1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:29.160]  An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly,
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:30.440]  i.e., Hitler.
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:35.980]  But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling
[1:48:35.980 --> 1:48:41.280]  through the alleyways, heard in the very halls of the government itself, for the traitor
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:43.000]  appears not a traitor.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:48.960]  He speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face in their arguments.
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:54.040]  He appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men.
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:56.320]  He rots the soul of a nation.
[1:48:56.320 --> 1:49:02.400]  He works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city.
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:06.680]  He infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist.
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:09.280]  A murderer is less to fear.
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:11.280]  The traitor is the plague.
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:17.680]  Well, there you are, nothing new under the sun as the Romans would say.
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:24.080]  Yeah, exactly what he was talking about, didn't he?
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:31.480]  The enemy within is a much more insidious prospect to have to deal with than an enemy
[1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:33.200]  plain in view.
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:38.560]  But it seems the Brits are waking up to common purpose in these EU foundations, literally
[1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:42.400]  taking control of almost every local citizen activist's charity.
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:45.760]  I mean, it does seem people are waking up there.
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:50.400]  Here, Americans are a little bit slower, but I mean, it's just, it's horrible.
[1:49:50.400 --> 1:49:54.560]  Alex, I can tell you that the grass always looks greener on the other side.
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:59.240]  I can tell you that we are actually probably slower to pick up on these things than you
[1:49:59.240 --> 1:50:00.240]  are in America.
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:09.880]  For example, in my Obama land book, I talk about our Prime Minister Tony Blair, who completely
[1:50:09.880 --> 1:50:17.200]  ruined this country through all sorts of human rights legislation, all these measures designed
[1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:21.640]  to increase the control of the state over the populace.
[1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:24.360]  We did not rebel against him.
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:26.960]  We dragged the Kool-Aid for 12 years, at least in America.
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:29.720]  Look what's happened after only a year of Obama.
[1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:31.320]  But that's the key.
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:32.600]  That's the key, though.
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:35.000]  In the name of human rights, they took your rights.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:39.360]  But you, at least your reckons are fighting back.
[1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:42.800]  Well, I mean, the Brits seem to be getting pretty upset.
[1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:46.840]  The problem is Gordon Brown, he's unelected, you can't seem to get rid of him because
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:48.080]  they manipulate parliament.
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:49.080]  Stay there.
[1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:53.240]  Final, final segment with you coming right back, James Dillingpole is our guest.
[1:50:53.240 --> 1:51:00.200]  I'm Alex Jones, prisonplanet.tv, jonesreport.com, infowars.com, stay with us.
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:02.480]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:51:02.480 --> 1:51:06.440]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:08.080]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[1:51:08.080 --> 1:51:12.120]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[1:51:12.120 --> 1:51:13.120]  or gold?
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:16.480]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:18.640]  possible that could even happen again.
[1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:23.280]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:24.280]  seeds.
[1:51:24.280 --> 1:51:29.120]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:31.000]  food for you and your family.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:34.880]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[1:51:34.880 --> 1:51:38.800]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:42.040]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:48.880]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:53.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:57.880]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:51:57.880 --> 1:52:00.320]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:06.360]  Hello, at ofthefield.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:11.280]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on ofthefield.com.
[1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:16.040]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[1:52:16.040 --> 1:52:20.480]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed
[1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:21.480]  another book.
[1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:22.600]  Boy was I wrong.
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:25.720]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:29.640]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[1:52:29.640 --> 1:52:32.760]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[1:52:32.760 --> 1:52:33.760]  Wow!
[1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:34.760]  I watched the DVD last night.
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:36.160]  I was all struck.
[1:52:36.160 --> 1:52:37.840]  What wonderful work you have done.
[1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:41.640]  This information can bless many people, thank you again.
[1:52:41.640 --> 1:52:42.640]  Thanks again.
[1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:45.520]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[1:52:45.520 --> 1:52:46.520]  Thank you.
[1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:49.560]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[1:53:04.880 --> 1:53:08.800]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:13.840]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, had less than 2 cents per
[1:53:13.840 --> 1:53:14.840]  gallon?
[1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:19.520]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine fluoride
[1:53:19.520 --> 1:53:21.600]  and contaminants from municipal water.
[1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:25.920]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for
[1:53:25.920 --> 1:53:27.720]  rainwater collection systems.
[1:53:27.720 --> 1:53:32.560]  From the smallest to the largest systems, bigberkeywaterfilters.com has what you need.

[1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:09.880]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:54:09.880 --> 1:54:18.600]  I fell into a burning ring of fire, I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:26.080]  James Dillingpole is our guest, writes for multiple international newspapers, best-selling
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:27.080]  author.
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:28.080]  We've got five minutes left.
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:35.320]  James, you were telling me off air, though, and I mentioned it, but I want you to elaborate.
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:36.320]  They do this.
[1:54:36.320 --> 1:54:42.040]  They give Nobel Prizes to Obama two weeks after he's elected.
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:44.680]  They made the decision then.
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:46.800]  They make Bernanke Man of the Year.
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:52.000]  They have Prince Charles, you told me, going to worship the particular facility caught
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:53.520]  red-handed in climate gave?
[1:54:53.520 --> 1:55:00.880]  Yeah, he's gone to tell the people at the climatic research unit that everything's okay.
[1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:04.640]  He says, well done, all of you that are future king.
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:05.920]  So that's all right then.
[1:55:05.920 --> 1:55:10.360]  It seems that there was no climate fraud going on after all, because our Prince of Wales
[1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:11.360]  says so.
[1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:14.360]  It's a bit sad, isn't it?
[1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:24.240]  But there are so many powerful people involved in this scam, and what are we going to do
[1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:25.240]  about it?
[1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:33.280]  Today, you've got the Spanish minister of the environment talking about when Spain takes
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:39.480]  over the presidency of the European Union, that the fight against climate change and
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:45.560]  the steps that the European Union must urgently take in order to apply the Copenhagen Accord.
[1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:48.160]  The process moves on regardless of...
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:55.360]  But their own report says that their windmill systems made people lose 2.2 jobs for every...
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:55:56.360]  I love that fact, Alex.
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:55:57.360]  Yeah, that's right.
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:03.560]  For every green job that is created, 2.2 jobs are lost in the real economy.
[1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:08.280]  So you can imagine how my heart really leaps when I hear our future prime minister, David
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:09.280]  Cameron.
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:14.240]  He was supposed to be a conservative, by the way, talking about how one of his priorities
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:19.680]  when he gets into power, when Gordon Brown goes, our ailing socialist Politburo chief,
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:26.760]  when he goes, his replacement's priority is going to be to create green jobs, yeah.
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:34.520]  But that's exactly what Prince Charles, Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Jacques Cousteau, the
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:41.680]  UN, the individual, Maurice Strong, they all say they want to destroy industrial society.
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:50.520]  Russian oligarch, there are so many plutocrats who are exposed to carbon trading, which is
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:57:01.480]  why they are so desperate for the Kyoto carbon trading agreement to be ratified at Mexico
[1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:02.480]  this year.
[1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:05.800]  And our job, our main job, is for this to be stopped.
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:08.240]  We've got to derail this gravy train somehow, Alex.
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:09.240]  Can you do it?
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:10.240]  Can you help me?
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:12.360]  Sir, I'm absolutely trying.
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:16.840]  We have no future if we don't, but the point I'm making is they're on record saying they
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:18.200]  want to destroy jobs.
[1:57:18.200 --> 1:57:20.080]  They know cold bloodedly.
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:25.040]  They want to bankrupt everybody, so we're all dependent on their collective estate.
[1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:30.720]  Yeah, I think there's probably a grain of truth in that.
[1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:37.440]  There's a few powerful people trying to divvy up the economy for themselves and crush the
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:39.720]  ordinary folks like you and me.
[1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:44.440]  Well, that's a grain the size of, you know, the size of Texas.
[1:57:44.440 --> 1:57:49.720]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, every time I drill down to the base level, it's, it's population
[1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:50.720]  reduction.
[1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:54.440]  I mean, look what the Chinese said at Copenhagen, they said, global one child policy.
[1:57:54.440 --> 1:58:01.120]  Yeah, well, it's, it's amazing how many of the people pushing ATW are also obsessed with
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:03.560]  the idea of reducing, reducing population.
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:07.720]  We've got a guy called Jonathan Porat, who is one of Prince Charles's advisors, and
[1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:14.560]  he is, you know, a rampant, deep green, and he is very keen on, on population control,
[1:58:14.560 --> 1:58:18.160]  which will be limited to the number of children we have.
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:28.000]  James, I'll tell you what, I know you've got to go, I've got a one minute break.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:32.520]  Come back and do about four minutes with us to finish up on the next stage of the fight,
[1:58:32.520 --> 1:58:34.040]  because I want you to be able to finish on that.
[1:58:34.040 --> 1:58:36.720]  What's coming up in Mexico.
[1:58:36.720 --> 1:58:37.720]  Stay right there.
[1:58:37.720 --> 1:58:42.960]  We'll be right back in one minute.
[1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:45.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:56.400]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:58:56.400 --> 1:59:01.080]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[1:59:01.080 --> 1:59:05.240]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[1:59:05.240 --> 1:59:09.840]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:15.120]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver
[1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:21.400]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[1:59:21.400 --> 1:59:25.720]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now
[1:59:25.720 --> 1:59:31.040]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:59:31.040 --> 1:59:36.280]  Very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[1:59:36.280 --> 1:59:42.560]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[1:59:42.560 --> 1:59:54.000]  Lungs Generator, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[1:59:54.000 --> 2:00:05.520]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.520 --> 2:00:10.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.320 --> 2:00:11.320]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.320 --> 2:00:13.520]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.520 --> 2:00:17.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:17.640 --> 2:00:21.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:21.840 --> 2:00:28.040]  Well, we've reached the halfway point here in this syndicated radio broadcast Wednesday,
[2:00:28.040 --> 2:00:30.680]  the 27th day of January 2010.
[2:00:30.680 --> 2:00:36.120]  Hard to believe that the first month of 2010 is almost over.
[2:00:36.120 --> 2:00:43.120]  I was rereading 1984, yesterday on air, where O'Brien is torturing Winston, and he says
[2:00:43.120 --> 2:00:44.960]  the party lives on forever.
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:46.600]  All that matters is that we succeed.
[2:00:46.600 --> 2:00:51.440]  And of course, he'd been a communist and learned how they operated, and he wrote the
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:56.880]  essay saying, this is what I really believe communism is going to do.
[2:00:56.880 --> 2:01:00.040]  And he also discovered that big financial interests were supporting it.
[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:03.320]  That's why Eric Blair, pen name George Arwell, was so amazing.
[2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:09.240]  Okay, we've got four minutes left with James Dillingpole, and he's here with us.
[2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:13.960]  Specifically, we have wounded the snake, as you quoted Shakespeare.
[2:01:13.960 --> 2:01:16.480]  We have not killed the snake, but not killed it, yeah.
[2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:22.360]  Yes, so their next battle plan, Gordon Brown has said they're just going to circumvent it,
[2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:27.320]  get wealthy nations to go ahead and put the money into the UN, and damn what the people
[2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:28.320]  want.
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:34.400]  Yeah, well, I mean, my great hope for America was that your Senate was going to scrap, was
[2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:39.920]  going to kill cap and trades, but Obama's going to get around that one by using the
[2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:40.920]  EPA.
[2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:48.440]  The EPA has decided to classify carbon dioxide as a poison, so it doesn't matter what the
[2:01:48.440 --> 2:01:49.440]  Senate thinks about it.
[2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:56.720]  This is exactly the kind of liberal fascism that was practiced by FDR, and Obama's using
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:58.400]  the same old tricks.
[2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:06.160]  I find that increasingly in America, as in Europe, the individual has very little control
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:10.040]  over what big government does to his life.
[2:02:10.040 --> 2:02:12.240]  Big government is becoming tyrannous.
[2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:18.280]  It is doing whatever it wants, so what do we do ahead of the next big event they're
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:19.280]  going to have in Mexico?
[2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:23.280]  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, Copenhagen was a flop, what we're going to see in Mexico
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:28.440]  in November is all the world leaders and all the eco-loons gathering together to try and
[2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:30.640]  really push for some hard legislation.
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:36.160]  But of course, that means that we've got eight months in which to present the case further
[2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:40.360]  for more and more people like the listeners of your show, the readers of my blogs and
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:43.960]  so on, to discover just what a fraud this is.
[2:02:43.960 --> 2:02:46.880]  And I don't reckon that people are going to understand it.
[2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:52.120]  Already we've seen in Australia, the leader of the Australian Liberal Party got kicked
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:56.320]  out of his job to try to push cap and trade because the voters didn't like it.
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:03:00.720]  And I think we're going to see more and more of this, of people reacting against this scam
[2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:05.240]  and saying, enough is enough, we will not be taxed, we will not be regulated in the
[2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:10.720]  name of a problem, Man Bear Pig, that was invested by Al Gore.
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:14.720]  But Man Bear Pig is real, it's half-man, half-bear, half-pig.
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:20.060]  Pachari says he's got a peer-reviewed report that he won't give us the data on that Man
[2:03:20.060 --> 2:03:21.560]  Bear Pigs are endangered.
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:29.800]  Yeah, I think the time has come to kill Man Bear Pig, to scotch and kill Man Bear Pig.
[2:03:29.800 --> 2:03:33.320]  Well then it would be an extinct species, like the unicorn.
[2:03:33.320 --> 2:03:38.920]  Yes, and then we have to feel very sad about it and blame ourselves like we did with the
[2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:39.920]  dodo.
[2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:44.360]  So ahead of what's happening in Mexico, we just need to continue because it was the
[2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:50.400]  activists, the bloggers that pushed and ran the blockade of the media blackout that first
[2:03:50.400 --> 2:03:54.600]  week or two on Climagate, we've got to run the blockade with all these new scandals.
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:59.280]  Yeah, none of this would have happened, these arguments would not be being heard were it
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:05.200]  not for the blogger's fair and the radio shows like yours, you know, the MSM has been
[2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:09.040]  completely against us, you know, the whole system has been against us trying to cover
[2:04:09.040 --> 2:04:10.040]  this scam up.
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:16.560]  I've got to throw this in quick, Cass Sunstein, the regulations are, in public policy paper
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:21.560]  says it should be illegal to criticize manmade global warming, I don't know if you saw that
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:23.640]  and separately Europe's been saying that.
[2:04:23.640 --> 2:04:29.760]  Yeah, absolutely, of course they would rather silence us using whatever means at their disposal
[2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:34.160]  and this is why, you know, our freedom of speech on the internet is more important to
[2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:38.880]  guard jealously than ever before because our lives and our freedoms depend upon it.
[2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:40.480]  That is no exaggeration.
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:44.640]  James Dillingpole.com is the website, James, always great having you on and I know we'll
[2:04:44.640 --> 2:04:46.800]  speak again.
[2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:47.800]  Have a great evening.
[2:04:47.800 --> 2:04:48.800]  Take care.
[2:04:48.800 --> 2:04:49.800]  Goodbye.
[2:04:49.800 --> 2:04:57.640]  Speaking of internet censorship, Australia, Italy, they're all announcing Chinese style
[2:04:57.640 --> 2:05:02.400]  censorship that's coming up too.
[2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:06.120]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:05:06.120 --> 2:05:09.280]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:14.880]  These are finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:05:14.880 --> 2:05:15.880]  at home.
[2:05:15.880 --> 2:05:19.800]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[2:05:19.800 --> 2:05:20.800]  shots.
[2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:25.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:05:25.680 --> 2:05:31.120]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:35.800]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:40.120]  William Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:42.320]  is saying who do we make the check out to?
[2:05:42.320 --> 2:05:48.320]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[2:05:48.320 --> 2:05:49.320]  the republic.
[2:05:49.320 --> 2:05:55.560]  Yet your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com we're watching online right

[2:06:08.760 --> 2:06:14.040]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[2:06:59.240 --> 2:07:04.240]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:08.600]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[2:07:08.600 --> 2:07:09.600]  do you want?
[2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:15.120]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:16.600]  Food is your only ammunition.
[2:07:16.600 --> 2:07:17.840]  How much do you want?
[2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:18.920]  When do you want it?
[2:07:18.920 --> 2:07:20.880]  Now or after the battle starts?
[2:07:20.880 --> 2:07:22.000]  When will you need it?
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.120]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:25.480]  Will there be any food?
[2:07:25.480 --> 2:07:26.920]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:31.040]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:07:31.040 --> 2:07:32.200]  and be immunized?
[2:07:32.200 --> 2:07:36.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:39.600]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:40.840]  How much will you need?
[2:07:40.840 --> 2:07:41.840]  We don't know.
[2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:42.840]  How much do you want?
[2:07:42.840 --> 2:07:43.840]  All you can get.
[2:07:43.840 --> 2:07:44.840]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:07:44.840 --> 2:07:48.040]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:07:48.040 --> 2:07:59.480]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[2:08:18.040 --> 2:08:23.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:29.480]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, Oliver Stone tells the truth about the U.S. and British
[2:08:29.480 --> 2:08:35.360]  government funding Hitler, but he doesn't want to talk about how they funded the Communist.
[2:08:35.360 --> 2:08:39.960]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown, writing for the globalist at Tragedy and Hope, admitted
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:45.320]  that he was allowed into their secret files and that they have financed it all, as long
[2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:48.920]  as it's authoritarian and centralized.
[2:08:48.920 --> 2:08:52.000]  The right wing uses fake terror.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:55.960]  The left also uses it, but the right wing uses fake terror, fake wars.
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:08:58.560]  The liberals do too, in the fake paradigm.
[2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:05.280]  But the real honey at the heart of the New World Order is fake environmentalism.
[2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:07.600]  And they're taking over all the towns, all the cities.
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:12.200]  The good news is the people are waking up to this.
[2:09:12.200 --> 2:09:19.400]  The good news is the people are now finding out this is a diabolical scam.
[2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:21.040]  That's why we just spent an hour on that.
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:23.080]  Have you been watching the Tim Geithner hearings?
[2:09:23.080 --> 2:09:24.080]  It's now over.
[2:09:24.080 --> 2:09:28.920]  Henry Paulson being grilled today, open talk of criminal indictments, of them having to
[2:09:28.920 --> 2:09:39.520]  step down, of Bernanke not getting confirmed in the Senate.
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:41.440]  It goes on and on.
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:46.080]  So we're going to be breaking that down today as well.
[2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:51.200]  Some of the other news I have is the big anthrax coverup is unraveling.
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:58.200]  But I want to right now give the toll free number out for callers to call in on these
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:01.840]  issues or whatever issues that you wish to discuss.
[2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:12.560]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231-1800-25992-31.
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:15.560]  We will get you up and on the air today.
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:20.320]  We're going to be taking calls for the next hour and 50 minutes off and on.
[2:10:20.320 --> 2:10:25.720]  But please have your question or comment quickly so we can try to get to more people.
[2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:27.800]  Problem is, callers call them with such important info.
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:31.640]  I tend to run off down rabbit trails.
[2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:37.720]  But the first hour I just talked about how big this is, that their flu hoax, their WMD
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:46.240]  hoax, their 9-11 hoax, their global greenhouse tax hoax, their banker bailout hoax, it's
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:48.640]  all being exposed as a fraud.
[2:10:48.640 --> 2:10:51.440]  It's all falling down around them.
[2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:54.800]  But as our last guest said, they still have the power, they're still moving forward.
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:10:55.960]  These are tyrants.
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:57.060]  They don't care.
[2:10:57.060 --> 2:10:58.360]  They're targeting the dumb down.
[2:10:58.360 --> 2:10:59.720]  They're targeting the children.
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:03.240]  They're targeting easily gullible women.
[2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:06.480]  They are targeting historically who tyrants target.
[2:11:06.480 --> 2:11:11.880]  Hitler said, and Joseph Goebbels, his propaganda minister, quoted it many other times in different
[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:18.520]  variants, first you get the women, then you've got the children.
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:21.360]  So follow the men.
[2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:28.320]  First you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:33.640]  That's why, depending on what format, but generally in advertising, more than 80%, and
[2:11:33.640 --> 2:11:37.280]  I learned this in basic marketing, and I didn't take a very fancy marketing class.
[2:11:37.280 --> 2:11:42.000]  It was 101 at a community college, the history of advertising.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:43.440]  It is an absolute fact.
[2:11:43.440 --> 2:11:45.320]  Anyone in advertising knows this.
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:49.680]  Over 80% of advertising targets women.
[2:11:49.680 --> 2:11:53.240]  Now in a show formatted like this, most of it targets men.
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:56.040]  I'd say 70%, though we're a small outfit.
[2:11:56.040 --> 2:11:58.240]  We don't really get scientific about it.
[2:11:58.240 --> 2:12:03.280]  We just sell what we believe in, and that were men, and men historically tend to get
[2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:08.840]  it more, and it's not that women are bad or women are stupid.
[2:12:08.840 --> 2:12:10.520]  It's that they're being targeted.
[2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:17.840]  They're being targeted by scientific propaganda, and over 80% of TV ads, especially print ads,
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:26.920]  are for women, because women tend to make the decisions on houses, on cars, on food,
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:31.800]  on drapes, on couches, on computers.
[2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:33.280]  I mean, women make the decisions.
[2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:36.840]  I mean, I'll tell you right now, I have a great relationship with my wife, because we're
[2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:39.160]  not battling for power with each other.
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:45.400]  I mean, if I really say this is the way it is, this is what we're doing, she defers
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:46.400]  to me.
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:47.400]  That's the natural order.
[2:12:47.400 --> 2:12:52.200]  But I respect what she has to say, and she ends up basically running everything.
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:54.920]  And that's really the natural order of it.
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:13:02.160]  The man goes out, is aggressive, tries to run a business, or work, defends the family.
[2:13:02.160 --> 2:13:03.960]  But generally, men defer to women.
[2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:08.680]  That's why Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow
[2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:10.200]  the men.
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:17.200]  And our biggest problem is women on this environmental front, because the men have been conditioned,
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:21.760]  and it is our natural state when we are given the opportunity to be lazy, to only be into
[2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:22.760]  sports.
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:27.080]  We want to party with our friends, we want to go drink beer, we want to go fishing.
[2:13:27.080 --> 2:13:28.760]  And women are concerned.
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:32.920]  Women care about society, and they want to help.
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:41.840]  And the government says they tend to be more trusting, whereas men just tend to not care
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:44.540]  until they're finally rallied by leaders.
[2:13:44.540 --> 2:13:48.240]  So it's the men the globalists are worried about, but they really should be worried
[2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:51.600]  about the women if we could ever get the message out to women.
[2:13:51.600 --> 2:13:55.120]  And once women have seen this for themselves, some of the strongest fighters for freedom
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:56.520]  are women.
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:14:03.040]  So women do care, women are great, I love women.
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:09.800]  It's not an indictment of women, it's that women need to know you have been targeted,
[2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:11.360]  period.
[2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:14.760]  You have been targeted in a big way.
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:16.440]  You need to understand that.
[2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:19.400]  You need to be conscious of that fact.
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:24.840]  You need to research the claims I'm making to you right now.
[2:14:24.840 --> 2:14:28.800]  I know most of you will just believe me out of hand, but there's nothing like going and
[2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:32.880]  researching the fact that most advertisement targets women.
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:36.160]  In fact, let's just see if this media truth is even being reported today.
[2:14:36.160 --> 2:14:41.200]  Let's go to Google and type in majority of advertising targeting women.
[2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:45.240]  I mean, it's just a fact, anybody in marketing knows this, but the general public doesn't
[2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:46.240]  know that.
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:52.480]  So majority of advertisement targets women and we'll click web, then we'll click news
[2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:54.920]  and we'll look at the different variants there.
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:15:00.640]  But if people would just read Edward Bernays two books or if you'd read some of the more
[2:15:00.640 --> 2:15:07.720]  modern books on how they do this, there it is.
[2:15:07.720 --> 2:15:15.160]  Why the vast majority of advertising is not mainly advertisements failed to resonate with
[2:15:15.160 --> 2:15:17.960]  their key target market women.
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:22.080]  So the first statement there is why isn't it resonating with their key target market
[2:15:22.080 --> 2:15:30.160]  women GM targets women and product placement Blitz target women tackles car advertising.
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:36.040]  That's just the latest male marketers beware when marketing to women with social media.
[2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:41.720]  Okay, let's say a market to women's the truth to leadership.
[2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:42.720]  That's what they want.
[2:15:42.720 --> 2:15:44.560]  They want, they want the truth.
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:47.800]  You can't be namby pamby when you're talking to women.
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:49.360]  You can't fake confidence either.
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:51.760]  You got to have the truth and be confident.
[2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:54.040]  Then women will listen to you.
[2:15:54.040 --> 2:15:58.880]  That's why they train men to be real and they all the sitcoms and drama show the weak stupid
[2:15:58.880 --> 2:16:02.200]  party guy that gets all the women and then women actually think that's what they want
[2:16:02.200 --> 2:16:07.520]  and they go out and get a divorce and men think of they just act dumber and act more
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:10.440]  foolish and act more weak that women are going to like them.
[2:16:10.440 --> 2:16:11.920]  No, that's not what women want.
[2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:13.080]  Women want strength.
[2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:14.080]  Okay.
[2:16:14.080 --> 2:16:18.400]  And they want somebody who doesn't compromise, but side issue.
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:21.880]  Let's, let's go to web.
[2:16:21.880 --> 2:16:22.880]  Click web.
[2:16:22.880 --> 2:16:25.520]  Let's see about advertising to women.
[2:16:25.520 --> 2:16:31.440]  Okay, we'll do news then.
[2:16:31.440 --> 2:16:36.280]  Yeah, look, targeting teen girls.
[2:16:36.280 --> 2:16:38.400]  It just goes on and on and on.
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:45.840]  The point is you are being targeted and we need to have more discussions about this.
[2:16:45.840 --> 2:16:51.800]  I mean, people need to be conscious of all of this and realize that there are agendas
[2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:53.400]  being pushed on you.
[2:16:53.400 --> 2:16:55.640]  We're very open about our agenda here.
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:17:01.160]  Bill of rights, constitution, declaration of independence, the strength of the family,
[2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:06.280]  not being broken up and controlled by the globalist, having true choices in life, letting
[2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:09.480]  you keep more of your money and not giving it to the social engineers.
[2:17:09.480 --> 2:17:10.560]  It's very, very simple.
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:17.920]  It's very, very popular, common sense, organic, common law idea.
[2:17:17.920 --> 2:17:27.040]  But as I said, your phone calls are coming up in the next segment, 1-800-259-9231.
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:31.200]  Also coming up, as I said, Oliver Stone says banksters enabled Hitler and the Nazis by
[2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:32.200]  Kurt Nemo.
[2:17:32.200 --> 2:17:37.000]  Here's an article, I want to go over that.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:43.280]  I want to get into this other key stack, I have three key stacks actually here of news.
[2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:45.520]  We haven't even really mentioned yet.
[2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:56.520]  SHIND, California inmates to Mexico, says Schwarzenegger.
[2:17:56.520 --> 2:18:00.600]  And this sounds good actually on the surface because he's saying SHIND undocumented.
[2:18:00.600 --> 2:18:02.320]  That's what's bankrupting California.
[2:18:02.320 --> 2:18:07.120]  The problem is these would end up being facilities run by the U.S. and that only integrates the
[2:18:07.120 --> 2:18:09.160]  North American Union more.
[2:18:09.160 --> 2:18:11.160]  So we're going to be going over that.
[2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:17.960]  Also airlines suffered record drop in traffic in 2009, not just, that's according to the
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:27.760]  International Airlines Consortium, the IATA, the Air Transport Association, International
[2:18:27.760 --> 2:18:32.000]  Air Transport Association said that.
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:34.440]  But that's not just because of the economy.
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:38.600]  It's because almost everybody I talk to don't take pleasure trips on planes, which is kind
[2:18:38.600 --> 2:18:40.280]  of what Maury Strong wants.
[2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:41.480]  They want us to stop traveling.
[2:18:41.480 --> 2:18:43.080]  They want us to stop living.
[2:18:43.080 --> 2:18:44.680]  They want us to stop going places.
[2:18:44.680 --> 2:18:49.400]  But what do you do when you can't get on a plane without being naked body-scanned?
[2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:52.840]  And now they're saying, you know what, we're just going to make everybody do it.
[2:18:52.840 --> 2:18:56.160]  That's why I got to get these contest launch to expose it.
[2:18:56.160 --> 2:18:58.960]  And you got to really keep that on the front burner.
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:02.520]  And there's already been test cases in Colorado where they're putting the naked body-scanners
[2:19:02.520 --> 2:19:03.520]  in.
[2:19:03.520 --> 2:19:06.840]  We posted a YouTube video of a constitutional lawyer trying to go to court and he said, you
[2:19:06.840 --> 2:19:08.320]  will not naked body-scan me.
[2:19:08.320 --> 2:19:10.520]  And they said, don't worry, we don't store the images.
[2:19:10.520 --> 2:19:11.520]  And he said, yes, you do.
[2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:13.960]  I've done the research, which they do store it.
[2:19:13.960 --> 2:19:19.960]  I mean, you know, they're going to videotape and record his genitals, you know, his behind,
[2:19:19.960 --> 2:19:25.920]  his love handles, you know, I mean, this is humiliation, training you to accept it.
[2:19:25.920 --> 2:19:34.080]  And continuing, dying news media looks to Apple tablet for hope.
[2:19:34.080 --> 2:19:35.080]  And guess what?
[2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:39.680]  The New York Observer reports after three months, only 35 subscriptions to Newsday website.
[2:19:39.680 --> 2:19:45.400]  Newsday, one of the biggest media outlets in the country, can't get 35 subscribers.
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:46.400]  They got 35.
[2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:51.160]  I mean, these people are a joke, man.
[2:19:51.160 --> 2:19:52.160]  They are hollow.
[2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:55.640]  That's why they're going for tyranny right now, because they know everybody is in full
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:19:59.880]  revolt against all of their revolting propaganda and garbage.
[2:19:59.880 --> 2:20:04.520]  Have your house payments skyrocketed under an adjustable rate mortgage?
[2:20:04.520 --> 2:20:07.640]  Have you been laid off or had your hours cut?
[2:20:07.640 --> 2:20:10.360]  Are balloon payments coming due?
[2:20:10.360 --> 2:20:14.200]  You need help from mortgagefraudexaminers.com.
[2:20:14.200 --> 2:20:18.680]  To stop the housing crisis, Congress and the White House are pinning their hopes on homeowners
[2:20:18.680 --> 2:20:20.600]  renegotiating their mortgages.
[2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:25.000]  The trouble is, the banks are saying no 80% of the time.
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:29.760]  Mortgagefraudexaminers.com can help you get the leverage you need to turn things around.
[2:20:29.760 --> 2:20:34.000]  They estimate that up to 85% of all mortgages are legally deficient.

[2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:40.440]  in your mortgage.
[2:20:40.440 --> 2:20:43.400]  It's like CSI for your home loan.
[2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:47.080]  Banks and lenders suddenly start cooperating when faced with a lawsuit for violating lending
[2:20:47.080 --> 2:20:48.840]  laws or appraisal fraud.

[2:21:01.840 --> 2:21:02.840]  Gold isn't for you.
[2:21:02.840 --> 2:21:06.880]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious
[2:21:06.880 --> 2:21:08.200]  metal investing firms.
[2:21:08.200 --> 2:21:09.200]  I get it.
[2:21:09.200 --> 2:21:12.880]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the
[2:21:12.880 --> 2:21:17.440]  Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that Social Security would
[2:21:17.440 --> 2:21:18.640]  be there for you.
[2:21:18.640 --> 2:21:19.880]  That's not what's happening.
[2:21:19.880 --> 2:21:24.720]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the
[2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:28.320]  dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:31.760]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[2:21:31.760 --> 2:21:36.120]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[2:21:36.120 --> 2:21:42.040]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[2:21:42.040 --> 2:21:45.400]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:46.400]  You should, too.
[2:21:46.400 --> 2:21:49.960]  Find out what they know, call us, and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very
[2:21:49.960 --> 2:21:56.760]  well, free 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[2:21:56.760 --> 2:22:02.760]  That's 800-686-2237.
[2:22:02.760 --> 2:22:06.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:22:06.520 --> 2:22:09.280]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:22:09.280 --> 2:22:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  at home.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:19.680]  We've determined the most influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:20.680]  calling the shots.
[2:22:20.680 --> 2:22:26.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:31.480]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:36.160]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:22:36.160 --> 2:22:38.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:22:38.560 --> 2:22:42.680]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:48.560]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[2:22:48.560 --> 2:22:49.560]  of the Republic.
[2:22:49.560 --> 2:22:54.360]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[2:24:06.120 --> 2:24:12.240]  They railed against the crowd.
[2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:19.680]  Another ragtag band declaring.
[2:24:19.680 --> 2:24:31.720]  They laid their bodies down in a bloody war for liberty, for their descendants.
[2:24:31.720 --> 2:24:34.840]  We are their descendants.
[2:24:34.840 --> 2:24:39.400]  Thanks for the renegades.
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:40.400]  We are free today.
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:42.920]  All right, I'm going to get more into the dying media.
[2:24:42.920 --> 2:24:48.600]  This fake terror plot, clearly a provocateur op.
[2:24:48.600 --> 2:24:53.720]  We're going to be going over Paul Watson's article, potential false flag attack to be
[2:24:53.720 --> 2:24:55.680]  blamed on Muslims foiled.
[2:24:55.680 --> 2:24:58.120]  But let's go to your phone calls right now.
[2:24:58.120 --> 2:24:59.760]  Let's talk to John in Illinois.
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:01.040]  John, you're on the air.
[2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:02.040]  Yeah, Alex.
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:04.800]  Good morning to your afternoon, whatever it is.
[2:25:04.800 --> 2:25:06.760]  We are Change Chicago here.
[2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:12.240]  Your buddy David Rothkopf had an article under the latest issue of Newsweek, a brief quote,
[2:25:12.240 --> 2:25:18.120]  current trends from rising seas and changing severe weather patterns associated with global
[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:23.120]  warming mean mega disasters will only become more likely.
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:28.000]  So he's blaming the Haiti earthquake on this, too.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  Which is hilarious.
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  That's unbelievable.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  What issue of Newsweek is that?
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:37.440]  It's huge that Rothkopf headline should be a blurb at Info Wars or prison planet Rothkopf,
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:42.640]  former head of Kissinger Group or top globalist Rothkopf agrees with Danny Glover earthquake
[2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:44.160]  and Haiti caused by global warming.
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:50.280]  I mean, what baloney January 25, 2010 issue of Newsweek and also one other item before
[2:25:50.280 --> 2:25:56.640]  I go a programming suggestion, more calling days for cops only.
[2:25:56.640 --> 2:26:03.400]  We have a very articulate cop here in Chicago who will be identified only as Citizen X.
[2:26:03.400 --> 2:26:08.840]  He regularly calls into Mancow's show, but he thinks it's great if he can get two million
[2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:12.400]  listeners to hear his 30 seconds on Mancow.
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:15.440]  And I'm trying to tell him, please call in the Alex.
[2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:20.840]  You'll get at least a minute and this man is very articulate, pro-second amendment,
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:22.280]  and he's known as Citizen X.
[2:26:22.280 --> 2:26:25.640]  He wants to keep his identity unknown, of course, to the Chicago authorities.
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:30.280]  Now it is good to hear from the, from the great police and the cops that are pro-america
[2:26:30.280 --> 2:26:34.720]  and really know what's going on, they're always articulate, they're smart, really smart.
[2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:37.640]  And then police run into that support tyranny.
[2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:38.960]  They're literally idiots.
[2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:41.240]  They can't even talk.
[2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:46.360]  I agree and please have more like once or twice a month have cop calling days only and
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:51.080]  I guarantee if Citizen X will call in and you will be extremely impressed with what
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:52.920]  this man has to say.
[2:26:52.920 --> 2:26:56.240]  He is pro-freedom, pro-second amendment and he can talk.
[2:26:56.240 --> 2:26:58.240]  John, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:03.640]  Genesis never went the past at six phone lines and we don't screen calls except when
[2:27:03.640 --> 2:27:08.360]  we say it's only on this topic a couple times a week, maybe, and then it's only to make
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:11.560]  sure you're on topic and we let you on with whatever your opinion is.
[2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:16.320]  That's not really screening, but to be able to have police call in, we have to say only
[2:27:16.320 --> 2:27:19.600]  police because they just can't get through on the lines.
[2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:23.840]  Same thing with military and we missed so many really interesting calls that way.
[2:27:23.840 --> 2:27:28.200]  I need to fire up our phone system more because it can take like over a hundred calls simultaneously.
[2:27:28.200 --> 2:27:31.800]  Then you got to have people to get on and talk to the caller though and make sure they're
[2:27:31.800 --> 2:27:33.720]  calling in on subject.
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:36.120]  Marco in Oregon, you're on the year, Marco.
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:37.920]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:40.360]  Thanks so much for having me on the show.
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:49.360]  I'm kind of see if this bulletin has come to your attention about the operation, a US
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:55.400]  relief operation that was a relief operation for Haiti that was launched out of Miami the
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:27:57.520]  day before the earthquake.
[2:27:57.520 --> 2:27:59.760]  Yeah, that was a press release.
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:02.040]  Yeah, that was put out by the army.
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:04.920]  Now, that's official.
[2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:06.960]  We reported that last Monday.
[2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:12.360]  Yeah, so you haven't put up anything on your site about that or have you seen some of that?
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:14.600]  Man, we sure try.
[2:28:14.600 --> 2:28:17.400]  I sent it all to Curt Nimmel and Paul Watson.
[2:28:17.400 --> 2:28:22.560]  They wrote an article where the Israelis admit that they can artificially trigger earthquakes.
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:27.640]  They're doing an under testing and with the Secretary of Defense quote about earthquake
[2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:31.560]  weapons, tectonic weapons from from 97.
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:33.960]  And I believe we did link to that.
[2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:37.640]  I forget the exact headline.
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:38.640]  What was the exact headline?
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:39.960]  I mean, we actually covered it.
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:47.160]  I mean, it was in the next of technology and the business of government magazine on
[2:28:47.160 --> 2:28:50.680]  January 6th, I'm sorry, January 15th.
[2:28:50.680 --> 2:28:56.280]  The headline was Defense launches online system to coordinate Haiti relief efforts.
[2:28:56.280 --> 2:29:00.040]  Yeah, no, we covered that three times last week.
[2:29:00.040 --> 2:29:01.520]  Oh, excellent.
[2:29:01.520 --> 2:29:02.520]  That's great.
[2:29:02.520 --> 2:29:09.320]  And so have you had anything about Chavez's comments about the US causing the quake as
[2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:10.320]  well?
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:11.320]  Yes.
[2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:19.320]  And at first, the newspapers there that basically work for him hadn't hadn't said, in fact,
[2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:20.720]  we did write an article about it.
[2:29:20.720 --> 2:29:25.080]  Curt Nimmel did write an article about it, Chavez and the Russian fleet US use earthquake
[2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:26.080]  weapon on Haiti.
[2:29:26.080 --> 2:29:27.080]  That's what I was about to say.
[2:29:27.080 --> 2:29:28.080]  That was quick acting guys.
[2:29:28.080 --> 2:29:30.240]  You got that up to about 20 seconds.
[2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:31.720]  In fact, just print it for me again.
[2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:32.720]  He wants to hear about it.
[2:29:32.720 --> 2:29:33.720]  I'll read the article.
[2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:34.720]  We're part of it.
[2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:35.720]  We come back.
[2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:36.720]  Yes, sir.
[2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:37.720]  We've written multiple articles.
[2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:38.720]  We've covered it at nauseam.
[2:29:38.720 --> 2:29:39.720]  Thank you, Marco.
[2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:40.720]  Thanks for reminding us about that, though.
[2:29:40.720 --> 2:29:45.720]  Kevin, Jeff, DeWayne and others, your calls are straight ahead on the other side.

[2:31:40.840 --> 2:31:44.400]  reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[2:32:00.280 --> 2:32:04.920]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:32:04.920 --> 2:32:09.240]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:32:09.240 --> 2:32:13.560]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:32:13.560 --> 2:32:14.840]  allows you to have.
[2:32:14.840 --> 2:32:20.600]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:32:20.600 --> 2:32:24.920]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:28.920]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:32:28.920 --> 2:32:32.440]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:32:32.440 --> 2:32:36.120]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:32:36.120 --> 2:32:40.920]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:32:40.920 --> 2:32:44.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:32:44.680 --> 2:32:46.040]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:50.280]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:32:50.280 --> 2:32:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:58.880]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0303.
[2:32:58.880 --> 2:33:00.880]  Go to mysolarbackup.com or call 0365.
[2:33:28.880 --> 2:33:41.880]  Yeah, Kurt Nemo's articles got that in there.
[2:33:41.880 --> 2:33:49.120]  Chavez and the Russian fleet used earthquake weapon on Haiti.
[2:33:49.120 --> 2:33:52.520]  That's what Chavez said we did cover last week.
[2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:58.040]  And he says that the Russian government gave him information to prove it, and then it gets
[2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:07.040]  into later how the Pentagon the day before was already getting ready for the relief operation.
[2:34:07.040 --> 2:34:10.480]  That is pretty ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:34:10.480 --> 2:34:13.480]  And here's another one that we covered last week.
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:20.080]  Averting disaster, calamities like Haiti Quake aren't just predictable, they're preventable.
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:24.720]  And then it gets into all that information.
[2:34:24.720 --> 2:34:29.920]  And I believe Watson wrote a story on that, too.
[2:34:29.920 --> 2:34:36.760]  Another story written by Kurt Nemo, and I actually want to get him to add a clip from
[2:34:36.760 --> 2:34:37.760]  Marshall Law.
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:43.440]  The last, it's a two-hour, 45-minute film.
[2:34:43.440 --> 2:34:49.920]  And the last 45 minutes are about how the United States and England were the main funders
[2:34:49.920 --> 2:34:51.920]  of the Nazis.
[2:34:51.920 --> 2:34:59.320]  The Nazis had a secret treaty with England to be able to attack Czechoslovakia and Poland.
[2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:02.000]  Then some type of double cross happened.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:08.280]  The King of England, Edward VIII, had to advocate.
[2:35:08.280 --> 2:35:11.680]  The media always says because he wanted to marry an American woman, no, because he was
[2:35:11.680 --> 2:35:15.200]  running around hiling Hitler and hanging out in Germany.
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:21.280]  So the point is Oliver Stone says, Banksters enabled Hitler and the Nazis.
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:26.360]  Filmmaker Oliver Stone has told the Canadian press that international bankers enabled Hitler
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:27.360]  and the Nazis.
[2:35:27.360 --> 2:35:32.120]  Adolf Hitler was a psychopath and a monster, but rose to power thanks to big business leaders
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:38.400]  and other supporters who have appreciated his vow to destroy communism and control
[2:35:38.400 --> 2:35:39.400]  workers.
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:45.440]  Hollywood filmmaker Oliver Stone said on Monday in Bangkok, Thailand.
[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:54.320]  But then we have a link in here to Anthony Sutton, the five parts of Dr. Stan Monteef
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:58.640]  interviewing him more than 20 years ago, Mr. Sutton is dead now.
[2:35:58.640 --> 2:36:04.960]  And he worked for the Brookings Institute, he worked for Congress, and he was tasked
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:13.760]  at Stanford to research the big foundations and big money and really dug out a lot of
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:17.800]  the original research on that so you can watch those videos.
[2:36:17.800 --> 2:36:22.680]  In fact, I'm tempted, reminded at the end of the show to play about 10 minutes of the
[2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:29.200]  opening interview with Anthony Sutton.
[2:36:29.200 --> 2:36:36.200]  Okay, what I'm going to do is, oh, yeah, my other point about Stone, again, he doesn't
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:44.720]  even talk about how simultaneously to destroy free societies, the big British and U.S. banks
[2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:51.200]  predominantly funded the Bolsheviks and the Nazis, and of course, the fascist originating
[2:36:51.200 --> 2:36:55.760]  the Nazi movement or what became the Nazi movement in Italy.
[2:36:55.760 --> 2:37:02.360]  Under Benito Mussolini, who'd been a communist leftist, then became a fascist.
[2:37:02.360 --> 2:37:08.640]  Everything with Hitler, Adolf Alois Hitler, national socialist, and the Nazis always send
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:12.520]  him emails and go, he wasn't a communist, he was fighting communism.
[2:37:12.520 --> 2:37:23.000]  Later after the Russian-German split happened, and yeah, he did fight communists for power
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.920]  in the streets of Germany.
[2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:30.080]  But this is all part of the larger great game that Dr. Kirill quickly wrote about in Tragedy
[2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:35.360]  and Hope, how the elites want to deal with dictators and thugs and centralized systems.
[2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:38.560]  They'll use the right, they'll use the left, they're total opportunists.
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:42.920]  It's piracy, it's fraud, it's theft, it's war.
[2:37:42.920 --> 2:37:49.600]  It's not fascist, it's not communist, it's not Nazi, it's not Catholic, it's not Jewish,
[2:37:49.600 --> 2:37:58.040]  it's not Scientologist, it's not Masons, though all of those major powerful groups are allied
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:37:59.040]  with the New World Order now.
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:02.880]  They've all been taken over or were with it from the start.
[2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:08.960]  So it's all these major ideologies seek to centralize control, and then society thinks
[2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:13.040]  they're going to choose what group they're part of, whether it's racially or religious
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:18.320]  or history or geography, and it doesn't matter because the elite give you all of these fake
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:19.320]  choices.
[2:38:19.320 --> 2:38:26.760]  They lay out all these different choices in front of you that are really false choices.
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:30.640]  Now again, I have three other big stacks of news, but I want to continue with your phone
[2:38:30.640 --> 2:38:35.280]  calls here right now, continue with the news blitz coming up here when we start the next
[2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:36.800]  hour.
[2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:42.200]  Let's go ahead and let's speak to Kevin in California.
[2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:43.200]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:45.040]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:46.040]  First time caller.
[2:38:46.040 --> 2:38:48.000]  I got two things for you.
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:53.160]  One is a message for all the people in Texas, whatever you do, do not make a mistake and
[2:38:53.160 --> 2:38:55.080]  vote against Deborah Medina.
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:39:00.080]  You need Deborah Medina as your governor, put her in the Texas governor's mansion.
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:01.400]  Well, Deborah's on tomorrow.
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:02.400]  Go ahead.
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:08.320]  My second thing is, Alex, I was going to ask you, are you familiar with the seven secret
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:10.480]  rulers of the world and who they really are?
[2:39:10.480 --> 2:39:15.080]  Do you have a list that has been exposed or is there any way of telling the public who
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:16.080]  it is?
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:22.480]  Well, I only go off what I can confirm, and the different managing roundtable groups,
[2:39:22.480 --> 2:39:29.280]  Krug, Club of Rome, then the regional roundtable subdirectorates like the CFR, Royal Institute
[2:39:29.280 --> 2:39:33.200]  of International Affairs.
[2:39:33.200 --> 2:39:39.120]  But it is rumored, and a lot of top sources say that they have sources, and the people
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:45.760]  I tend to respect, that there is then a Council of 30, a Council of 13, and then I've seen
[2:39:45.760 --> 2:39:52.160]  the Council of 7, but what we've been able to confirm from high level former CIA people
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:58.440]  and others with Colonel Craig Roberts and others whose talk to these people, and I believe
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:03.440]  it when he says that he had to make stuff up, then I've also seen that from other researchers
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:08.000]  that there is, that it doesn't get smaller than a Council of 13.
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:16.440]  It's a Council of 13, but I mean, would you like to elaborate or do you have any points?
[2:40:16.440 --> 2:40:18.160]  Yes, I do.
[2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:23.360]  I got this website that my friend sent me last night, and it's got on here, it's called
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:30.560]  the skepticwiki.org, and it comes up with the NWO New World Order chart, do you know
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:31.560]  about that?
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:35.320]  I mean, there's a lot of charts, I mean, I'm not poo-pooing it, but just because somebody
[2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:40.680]  makes a chart, I could make a chart with Donald Duck at the top of it, I mean, who does it
[2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:41.680]  say?
[2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:44.600]  Okay, I'll give you the companies, and you tell me if you think they're legit.
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:52.600]  The company, Kraft Foods, the RAND Corporation, Oprah Winfrey, Walmart, Noam Chomsky, and
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:59.600]  the other one is the, you know, I think that's a joke website.
[2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:08.240]  I mean, that's like Mike Myers saying it's run by Colonel Sanders, I mean, they're saying
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:10.880]  those are the rulers of the world.
[2:41:10.880 --> 2:41:15.880]  That's what the one says, but Alex, I got documentation for you that I work for Walgreens.
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:16.880]  I'll send it to me.
[2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:17.880]  You got Walgreens.
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:19.440]  Okay, separate issue, go ahead.
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:23.360]  I work for Walgreens, and we've never seen the owner to this day, and that's a pharmaceutical.
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:26.040]  I'm positive our owner's on that list.
[2:41:26.040 --> 2:41:27.040]  I'm positive.
[2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:29.720]  Okay, look, I appreciate your call, sir.
[2:41:29.720 --> 2:41:31.880]  Send me the information, okay?
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:34.240]  Oprah Winfrey is not on the secret council of seven.
[2:41:34.240 --> 2:41:36.120]  We don't even know if there's a council of seven.
[2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:38.360]  We know there's a council of 13.
[2:41:38.360 --> 2:41:39.360]  Okay?
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:56.400]  So, Oprah Winfrey is, has been invited to top Eugenics secret conferences at the Rockefeller
[2:41:56.400 --> 2:41:57.400]  University.
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:02.360]  That's been in the times of London to discuss forced population reduction, and she is as
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:07.840]  big as it gets in media, the biggest thing out there, because she can manipulate women.
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:13.640]  She's there to control women with kind of a new age-type agenda that feeds into their
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:15.720]  whole plan.
[2:42:15.720 --> 2:42:22.200]  But, and some of the other names on there, if you want to know who's some of the most
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:32.400]  powerful people in the world are, it is the British house of Rothschild, and then there's
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:33.400]  the French house.
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:35.800]  They're very powerful, but not as powerful as the British.
[2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:37.200]  That's the head house.
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:39.320]  There's the Italian house.
[2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:42.200]  There's the German house.
[2:42:42.200 --> 2:42:46.880]  There are the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas who are intermarried with a bunch of families, intermarried with
[2:42:46.880 --> 2:42:51.440]  the Rothschilds as well, and that's as high as it gets, the Rothschilds and the house
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:57.520]  of Gotha, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and they've knocked off the Habsburgs and many other royal families
[2:42:57.520 --> 2:43:00.280]  that they were cousins with, the Tsars were their cousins.
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:01.280]  They knocked them off.
[2:43:01.280 --> 2:43:07.400]  So, really, the last man standing with empires and imperial leadership are the British and
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:13.400]  the Japanese, but the Japanese factor in at a lower room, and the Japanese royalty does
[2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:14.400]  swear fealty.
[2:43:14.400 --> 2:43:19.440]  I've even seen the ritual at the Tower of London where all the royalty of the world
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:24.240]  comes and swears allegiance to the Queen, and then, of course, the Rockefellers are
[2:43:24.240 --> 2:43:26.760]  right up there at the very top.
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:34.360]  The superstars of the New World Order are the super-gophers, the men given the power.
[2:43:34.360 --> 2:43:41.000]  In Roman times, they would call it a legged, and there might be as many as 10.
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:47.780]  And every major country under the Roman Empire, whether it was Egypt or whether it was Greece
[2:43:47.780 --> 2:43:57.880]  or whether it was Judea or whether it was Germania or Albion, Britain today, they would
[2:43:57.880 --> 2:44:03.640]  have legates who would travel between the places to speak with the imperial seal and
[2:44:03.640 --> 2:44:07.480]  to speak as the emperor.
[2:44:07.480 --> 2:44:18.180]  And so, a Henry Kissinger, a George Shultz, someone of that level, a Gordon Brown is definitely
[2:44:18.180 --> 2:44:23.820]  an imperial legged of the New World Order, and he's one of the rarities where he's actually
[2:44:23.820 --> 2:44:29.500]  in power and running the G20 and actually calling the shots, to a great extent, as the
[2:44:29.500 --> 2:44:30.860]  main manager right now.
[2:44:30.860 --> 2:44:39.460]  Gordon Brown is really the kingpin politically, but normally people don't become legates
[2:44:39.460 --> 2:44:46.300]  or even sub-legates, because they have sub-legates as well, it's an imperial structure, until
[2:44:46.300 --> 2:44:51.500]  they've already been president or prime minister and done a good job, and then they graduate
[2:44:51.500 --> 2:44:55.900]  into that level of a Henry Kissinger.
[2:44:55.900 --> 2:45:01.100]  Something like a Henry Kissinger is more powerful than a Richard Nixon.
[2:45:01.100 --> 2:45:05.020]  And people are told, we'll give you the money, put you in power, you've got to put Robert
[2:45:05.020 --> 2:45:10.220]  McNamara, a legged, you've got to put a Henry Kissinger, a legged, they're going to call
[2:45:10.220 --> 2:45:11.220]  the shots.
[2:45:11.220 --> 2:45:16.780]  And you listen to the tapes of McNamara, who oversaw the killing of Kennedy and the rest
[2:45:16.780 --> 2:45:29.700]  of it, and LBJLB at his ranch outside Austin, talking to DC, and McNamara says, yes, sir,
[2:45:29.700 --> 2:45:36.540]  but McNamara is telling him what to do, and the subservient one is LBJ, and he's telling
[2:45:36.540 --> 2:45:40.140]  him and LBJ saying, okay, yes, how do I do that?
[2:45:40.140 --> 2:45:49.660]  And a sublegged would be in the White House right now, Rahm Emanuel.
[2:45:49.660 --> 2:45:52.940]  And that's why he constantly talks down to Obama, whenever the congressional leaders
[2:45:52.940 --> 2:45:57.100]  of both parties are there, and the cameras aren't on, he gets up and cracks his knuckles
[2:45:57.100 --> 2:46:01.540]  and bosses Obama around, and they basically looked at Rahm Emanuel and say, yes, sir,
[2:46:01.540 --> 2:46:04.460]  Mr. President.
[2:46:04.460 --> 2:46:07.540]  And then they basically slap Obama around and tell him, get out there and read the
[2:46:07.540 --> 2:46:10.340]  teleprompter.
[2:46:10.340 --> 2:46:13.260]  And it's bad news.
[2:46:13.260 --> 2:46:14.260]  It's bad news.
[2:46:14.260 --> 2:46:16.220]  Kevin, I appreciate your call.
[2:46:16.220 --> 2:46:18.340]  Let's talk to Jeff in South Carolina.
[2:46:18.340 --> 2:46:20.060]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[2:46:20.060 --> 2:46:22.540]  Alex, is Jeff there?
[2:46:22.540 --> 2:46:23.540]  Yes, sir.
[2:46:23.540 --> 2:46:24.540]  All right.
[2:46:24.540 --> 2:46:25.540]  Jeff in South Carolina.
[2:46:25.540 --> 2:46:27.540]  Listen, I'm a first time caller.
[2:46:27.540 --> 2:46:33.620]  I just want to tell everybody if you're listening, and you're not sure, everything Alex says
[2:46:33.620 --> 2:46:34.620]  actually does come true.
[2:46:34.620 --> 2:46:41.300]  I've got an example right here in South Carolina, just came out in the paper and was talking
[2:46:41.300 --> 2:46:45.180]  about how every baby within 24 hours has a blood sample.
[2:46:45.180 --> 2:46:49.220]  It sent to the state lab and then returned to the genetic center.
[2:46:49.220 --> 2:46:55.060]  So and I've heard you in the past talk about how you protested Texas doing that.
[2:46:55.060 --> 2:46:57.460]  And well, certainly be specific.
[2:46:57.460 --> 2:47:03.980]  I've known since I got on air 14 years ago, there's a secret UN project and they have
[2:47:03.980 --> 2:47:06.420]  centers all over the world that store it.
[2:47:06.420 --> 2:47:11.300]  For 37 years ago, it started in a UN secret treaty and now they have a secret treaty that
[2:47:11.300 --> 2:47:16.260]  got leaked last year for net censorship and Italy's adopting it, Australia's adopting
[2:47:16.260 --> 2:47:20.140]  and I have the news where they're just totally shutting freedom down and they're talking
[2:47:20.140 --> 2:47:21.140]  about it here.
[2:47:21.140 --> 2:47:26.260]  So, so when you think it's not the state storing it, they store it regionally and your state
[2:47:26.260 --> 2:47:31.300]  must be one of the six different, it was for now it's six regional departments.
[2:47:31.300 --> 2:47:34.300]  But yes, they lie to you and tell you it's a blood test.
[2:47:34.300 --> 2:47:35.380]  They could do that at the hospital.
[2:47:35.380 --> 2:47:36.620]  They save your baby's blood.
[2:47:36.620 --> 2:47:40.020]  Yeah, it's just strange when you hear it and you say, oh no, but now you know, it came
[2:47:40.020 --> 2:47:41.020]  out in the paper.
[2:47:41.020 --> 2:47:42.020]  So I was like, no, Alex is right.
[2:47:42.020 --> 2:47:43.020]  Well, let me say this.
[2:47:43.020 --> 2:47:45.700]  You said I'm always right and it always comes true.
[2:47:45.700 --> 2:47:46.700]  Let's be clear.
[2:47:46.700 --> 2:47:47.860]  I know their game plan.
[2:47:47.860 --> 2:47:49.900]  I attempt to tell you the truth.
[2:47:49.900 --> 2:47:51.980]  I don't attempt to ever lie.
[2:47:51.980 --> 2:47:52.980]  My job is very easy.
[2:47:52.980 --> 2:47:53.980]  I do research.
[2:47:53.980 --> 2:47:54.980]  I have passion.
[2:47:54.980 --> 2:47:56.580]  I tell the truth.
[2:47:56.580 --> 2:47:57.580]  You should check out everything.
[2:47:57.580 --> 2:48:01.020]  You should still check out everything I say because I'm not infallible.
[2:48:01.020 --> 2:48:03.980]  I do make mistakes, but it's like 5% of the time out of a hundred.
[2:48:03.980 --> 2:48:09.700]  I mean, literally we don't make a lot of mistakes here because we know what we're talking about,
[2:48:09.700 --> 2:48:10.700]  but go ahead.
[2:48:10.700 --> 2:48:14.220]  Well, there was one, there's something else I heard on the GCN network and I wouldn't
[2:48:14.220 --> 2:48:15.780]  believe it unless I heard it from you.
[2:48:15.780 --> 2:48:22.260]  If you research it, they said about the earthquake in Haiti that harp records were deleted the
[2:48:22.260 --> 2:48:26.740]  day before the earthquake happened, January 11th is when the records are not available.
[2:48:26.740 --> 2:48:31.260]  They also said that a certain British ships that normally are docked, they're left out
[2:48:31.260 --> 2:48:34.260]  a week earlier than they normally just stay there.
[2:48:34.260 --> 2:48:39.020]  They normally stay there the whole time and I thought that was interesting, but I wanted
[2:48:39.020 --> 2:48:40.660]  you to look into that.
[2:48:40.660 --> 2:48:45.380]  Well, no ships stay places all the time unless they're in moth balls, but look, they have
[2:48:45.380 --> 2:48:49.100]  earthquake weapons, that's admitted, that's on record.
[2:48:49.100 --> 2:48:54.620]  The Pentagon was preparing, not just a drill, but running a full op to respond to a hurricane
[2:48:54.620 --> 2:48:55.620]  in Haiti.
[2:48:55.620 --> 2:48:56.620]  It was a hurricane season.
[2:48:56.620 --> 2:49:04.420]  It was a drill the day before out of Florida, um, Shavez, who I liked to a certain degree
[2:49:04.420 --> 2:49:09.580]  three or four years ago because he did stop the North Americans, Central South American
[2:49:09.580 --> 2:49:13.340]  Union, free trade areas, the Americas going ahead.
[2:49:13.340 --> 2:49:17.180]  He did set them back, but then he does censor and do a lot of things.
[2:49:17.180 --> 2:49:21.260]  So I don't know if I believe him or not, but he says the Russians gave them data.
[2:49:21.260 --> 2:49:25.020]  That's the article that Kurt Nemo wrote with links to it, that the Russians gave him the
[2:49:25.020 --> 2:49:27.700]  data that it was an earthquake tectonic weapon.
[2:49:27.700 --> 2:49:32.020]  Then I have secretary of defense Cohen saying they have earthquake weapons.
[2:49:32.020 --> 2:49:33.020]  So I don't know.
[2:49:33.020 --> 2:49:37.460]  See, I have to, I know they're taking your baby's blood and putting it into bio weapon
[2:49:37.460 --> 2:49:47.540]  lab to study race specific bio weapons and also patent key DNA strands and key, uh, uh,
[2:49:47.540 --> 2:49:50.740]  things in people's genetics that are unique to individuals.
[2:49:50.740 --> 2:49:53.540]  And then this has been going on for, again, more than 30 years.
[2:49:53.540 --> 2:49:59.140]  I've seen the federal cases a decade ago where families would go get, you know, say
[2:49:59.140 --> 2:50:02.660]  their 30 year old is dying of some cancer, say bone marrow.
[2:50:02.660 --> 2:50:07.300]  And in one case I saw in San Francisco, I'm going from memory here, but they went to get
[2:50:07.300 --> 2:50:13.260]  a genetic therapy and a company they never heard of came and said, you don't get that
[2:50:13.260 --> 2:50:16.220]  therapy unless you pay these hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[2:50:16.220 --> 2:50:22.020]  We got your blood sample at birth and we patented, uh, this particular hemoglobin or whatever
[2:50:22.020 --> 2:50:23.020]  it was.
[2:50:23.020 --> 2:50:25.620]  This was like 10 years ago, but I remember reading the article on air.
[2:50:25.620 --> 2:50:28.580]  So that family sued and lost.
[2:50:28.580 --> 2:50:34.380]  And the federal court said the, uh, the UN basically owns your blood.
[2:50:34.380 --> 2:50:36.180]  So do you understand what they're doing, sir?
[2:50:36.180 --> 2:50:41.340]  Yeah, it's incredible, man, but again, go look that up cause 10 years ago that's foggy.
[2:50:41.340 --> 2:50:45.100]  But I mean, I know I read it and saw it and did several stories on it.
[2:50:45.100 --> 2:50:48.020]  In fact, Google this for me right now, guys, courts rule.
[2:50:48.020 --> 2:50:49.500]  You do not own your own DNA.
[2:50:49.500 --> 2:50:51.100]  That should, that should pull it up.
[2:50:51.100 --> 2:50:55.820]  Uh, for genetic treatments, you'll have to add that or it'll be some police case.
[2:50:55.820 --> 2:51:02.380]  Appreciate your call, sir.
[2:51:02.380 --> 2:51:07.420]  Are you suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart
[2:51:07.420 --> 2:51:12.300]  failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeats, clogged arteries.

[2:52:02.900 --> 2:52:06.620]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:52:06.620 --> 2:52:09.780]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:09.780 --> 2:52:14.140]  As we're finishing off this agenda, there'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[2:52:14.140 --> 2:52:15.140]  at home.
[2:52:15.140 --> 2:52:20.260]  I've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[2:52:20.260 --> 2:52:21.260]  shots.
[2:52:21.260 --> 2:52:26.140]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:26.140 --> 2:52:31.580]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[2:52:31.580 --> 2:52:36.260]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:52:36.260 --> 2:52:38.660]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:52:38.660 --> 2:52:42.780]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:52:42.780 --> 2:52:48.620]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[2:52:48.620 --> 2:52:49.980]  of the Republic.

[2:54:17.180 --> 2:54:31.940]  Yeah, we search engine for court rules.
[2:54:31.940 --> 2:54:36.900]  Citizens do not own their own DNA and it came up with police can now taser you to make you
[2:54:36.900 --> 2:54:44.220]  give DNA or to make you answer questions, torture.
[2:54:44.220 --> 2:54:52.540]  You might want to search under court rules, biotech company owns man's DNA.
[2:54:52.540 --> 2:54:53.540]  That should get it.
[2:54:53.540 --> 2:54:55.500]  It was a California federal court.
[2:54:55.500 --> 2:55:00.660]  I've seen several of them over the years, but again, they get your blood and then they
[2:55:00.660 --> 2:55:01.660]  own it.
[2:55:01.660 --> 2:55:06.860]  And it goes to the UN, it goes to Cold Springs Harbor, Human Genome Project, IBM, Eugenics,
[2:55:06.860 --> 2:55:08.060]  that's all on record.
[2:55:08.060 --> 2:55:12.780]  But I like to just say something here on air and if it was 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago,
[2:55:12.780 --> 2:55:14.980]  I like to then try to pull it up.
[2:55:14.980 --> 2:55:19.980]  The problem with the internet is newer stuff in the last few years is the first 10 or 15,
[2:55:19.980 --> 2:55:21.580]  20 search pages.
[2:55:21.580 --> 2:55:24.100]  Unless you can get the headline exactly right.
[2:55:24.100 --> 2:55:32.420]  And my weakness is I can't remember headlines from 10 years ago, usually, usually.
[2:55:32.420 --> 2:55:40.140]  Some things I've quoted so many times on air, I can remember stuff from 14 years ago.
[2:55:40.140 --> 2:55:51.500]  Like US code, title, 50, chapter 32, subsection 1,528 paragraph B. But I can only do that
[2:55:51.500 --> 2:55:52.700]  without even trying to think about it.
[2:55:52.700 --> 2:55:57.220]  It just has to spontaneously pop out.
[2:55:57.220 --> 2:56:04.420]  I'm 36 next month and they say when you hit age 30, you start losing massive brain cells
[2:56:04.420 --> 2:56:06.380]  every day.
[2:56:06.380 --> 2:56:12.940]  And if you do, if you did have a photographic memory, it starts to fade with most people.
[2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:22.140]  And I still have a great memory, but now I can't do that hat trick I could do previously.
[2:56:22.140 --> 2:56:23.140]  There's a CBS.
[2:56:23.140 --> 2:56:25.780]  Yeah, there it is.
[2:56:25.780 --> 2:56:27.500]  You found it.
[2:56:27.500 --> 2:56:28.700]  And how many years old?
[2:56:28.700 --> 2:56:30.180]  That's 2009.
[2:56:30.180 --> 2:56:32.940]  So that's a new one, see.
[2:56:32.940 --> 2:56:34.020]  That's a new one.
[2:56:34.020 --> 2:56:35.020]  Print that for me.
[2:56:35.020 --> 2:56:36.180]  It says exactly what I was saying.
[2:56:36.180 --> 2:56:40.700]  It's hard to believe, but private companies hold the patent rights to some of the genes
[2:56:40.700 --> 2:56:41.700]  in your body.
[2:56:41.700 --> 2:56:45.500]  The companies say the patents help them develop new treatments for serious diseases.
[2:56:45.500 --> 2:56:51.580]  But this week, a group of cancer patients, see, I told you 10 years ago, was cancer patients.
[2:56:51.580 --> 2:56:55.300]  And the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit claiming the patents put them in
[2:56:55.300 --> 2:57:00.060]  danger, report CBS news correspondent.
[2:57:00.060 --> 2:57:03.660]  Exactly as I said from 10 years ago.
[2:57:03.660 --> 2:57:06.980]  And then here's some more when you do a search, you find completely unrelated stuff.
[2:57:06.980 --> 2:57:09.900]  Indiana court, no warrant needed to force DNA testing.
[2:57:09.900 --> 2:57:13.140]  Oh, that's freedom.
[2:57:13.140 --> 2:57:17.940]  Defense shocked court rules, police could taser to collect DNA samples.
[2:57:17.940 --> 2:57:22.380]  Brits arresting people solely to get their DNA on the suspects database.
[2:57:22.380 --> 2:57:25.380]  And here it is.
[2:57:25.380 --> 2:57:27.980]  Can corporations own your DNA?
[2:57:27.980 --> 2:57:31.780]  And see, the thing is, whenever I have reporters here, I'll just rattle the stuff off at them
[2:57:31.780 --> 2:57:36.780]  and they just think I'm making it up because I guess they can't rattle it off.
[2:57:36.780 --> 2:57:40.940]  They don't do this 14 hours a day.
[2:57:40.940 --> 2:57:41.940]  Rattle it off, rattle it off.
[2:57:41.940 --> 2:57:46.060]  I mean, I said exactly what it was.
[2:57:46.060 --> 2:57:47.060]  And there it is.
[2:57:47.060 --> 2:57:49.780]  But can't find the 10 year old article.
[2:57:49.780 --> 2:57:50.780]  Sorry.
[2:57:50.780 --> 2:58:04.060]  We've got one here from CBS news that came out May 13th of 2009 last year.
[2:58:04.060 --> 2:58:09.180]  I briefly want to remind listeners that I am a documentary film maker.
[2:58:09.180 --> 2:58:13.420]  If you believe in what we're doing here financially support us plus get the most powerful videos
[2:58:13.420 --> 2:58:17.620]  out there bar none.
[2:58:17.620 --> 2:58:22.660]  All the republic Obama deception in game terror storm.
[2:58:22.660 --> 2:58:28.500]  Other films we carry at big discounts like camp FEMA proving all the FEMA camps shadow
[2:58:28.500 --> 2:58:33.940]  government can now preorder how we'd won the West that exposes how it's defeating the
[2:58:33.940 --> 2:58:38.540]  feds on stage rights and can bankrupt the big banks that we can legalize or decriminalize
[2:58:38.540 --> 2:58:43.540]  drugs.
[2:58:43.540 --> 2:58:46.020]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:46.020 --> 2:58:51.500]  Be sure to visit GCN live.com today.
[2:58:51.500 --> 2:58:54.580]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:58:54.580 --> 2:58:58.940]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[2:58:58.940 --> 2:58:59.940]  do you want?
[2:58:59.940 --> 2:59:05.500]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:59:05.500 --> 2:59:06.960]  Food is your only ammunition.
[2:59:06.960 --> 2:59:08.180]  How much do you want?
[2:59:08.180 --> 2:59:11.220]  When do you want it now or after the battle starts?
[2:59:11.220 --> 2:59:12.340]  When will you need it?
[2:59:12.340 --> 2:59:14.460]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:59:14.460 --> 2:59:15.820]  Will there be any food?
[2:59:15.820 --> 2:59:19.860]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[2:59:19.860 --> 2:59:22.580]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:59:22.580 --> 2:59:26.340]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:59:26.340 --> 2:59:29.940]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:59:29.940 --> 2:59:31.180]  How much will you need?
[2:59:31.180 --> 2:59:32.180]  We don't know.
[2:59:32.180 --> 2:59:33.180]  How much do you want?
[2:59:33.180 --> 2:59:34.180]  All you can get.
[2:59:34.180 --> 2:59:35.180]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:59:35.180 --> 2:59:42.860]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[2:59:42.860 --> 2:59:49.860]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:00:12.860 --> 3:00:18.580]  We're already into the final hour, thank you so much for joining us.
[3:00:18.580 --> 3:00:22.980]  I want to continue with some calls and then I will get into these other three stacks of
[3:00:22.980 --> 3:00:23.980]  key news.
[3:00:23.980 --> 3:00:28.460]  We've been covering quite a bit of news here today, proud of myself, keeping to the schedule
[3:00:28.460 --> 3:00:31.220]  to get out as much information as possible.
[3:00:31.220 --> 3:00:34.420]  Buddy in New York, how may I serve you?
[3:00:34.420 --> 3:00:37.660]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[3:00:37.660 --> 3:00:38.660]  Good.
[3:00:38.660 --> 3:00:41.940]  I got three quick things.
[3:00:41.940 --> 3:00:47.420]  One thing, a guy on YouTube called Nuttin' Fancy, he's like a big gun guy.
[3:00:47.420 --> 3:00:49.940]  I think you'd be a good guest to have on your show.
[3:00:49.940 --> 3:00:52.740]  What's going on with you guys at the gun show down in Texas?
[3:00:52.740 --> 3:00:58.180]  He'd be a pretty interesting guy because he reviews guns and survival gear and stuff like
[3:00:58.180 --> 3:00:59.180]  that.
[3:00:59.180 --> 3:01:04.100]  He has like a huge viewer based on YouTube, so it'd be a good way of waking a lot of
[3:01:04.100 --> 3:01:07.260]  people up.
[3:01:07.260 --> 3:01:14.060]  And second thing is if Deborah Medina gets in, Texas is going to be like the new Patriot
[3:01:14.060 --> 3:01:17.260]  Haven for people to just, you know, flock to, man.
[3:01:17.260 --> 3:01:20.980]  Well, because then it will lead other people to run for state office.
[3:01:20.980 --> 3:01:28.620]  But in Texas, the governors are actually weak compared to other states because under reconstruction
[3:01:28.620 --> 3:01:30.980]  they put in a bunch of puppet governors.
[3:01:30.980 --> 3:01:35.060]  And so the lieutenant governor is really the governor of Texas, though the governor
[3:01:35.060 --> 3:01:40.460]  does have some power in their bully pulpit and their veto power.
[3:01:40.460 --> 3:01:45.060]  And the governors have taken more power on themselves in Texas in the last few decades.
[3:01:45.060 --> 3:01:48.380]  But it is going to be a great victory, buddy.
[3:01:48.380 --> 3:01:49.500]  I appreciate your call.
[3:01:49.500 --> 3:01:52.780]  Michael in California, you're on the air.
[3:01:52.780 --> 3:01:53.780]  Alex.
[3:01:53.780 --> 3:01:54.780]  Yes, sir.
[3:01:54.780 --> 3:01:55.780]  How you doing, man?
[3:01:55.780 --> 3:02:01.460]  I'm just calling regarding the comments that you made on the communism and stuff like
[3:02:01.460 --> 3:02:06.820]  that, listening to your show a few days ago regarding our Glenn Beck documentaries and
[3:02:06.820 --> 3:02:09.340]  stuff like that, that he's going to start doing.
[3:02:09.340 --> 3:02:14.820]  And I decided to look into it and I actually watched it on Friday.
[3:02:14.820 --> 3:02:17.740]  And I feel like it's, you know, it's pretty good.
[3:02:17.740 --> 3:02:18.740]  It's okay.
[3:02:18.740 --> 3:02:24.980]  Left out a lot of details, of course, but I feel like I think it's a great way to start
[3:02:24.980 --> 3:02:32.540]  having your end game movie at other shows that I noticed that while I saw that they
[3:02:32.540 --> 3:02:38.940]  were having a tour of Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly and they're going to hit up California
[3:02:38.940 --> 3:02:39.940]  where I'm at.
[3:02:39.940 --> 3:02:45.260]  And obviously, Texas also, and I feel like it's a great way to start out possibly staying
[3:02:45.260 --> 3:02:51.860]  outside of their shows and handing out lots of documentaries that you carry, of course.
[3:02:51.860 --> 3:02:52.860]  Absolutely.
[3:02:52.860 --> 3:02:56.340]  And Michael, I've done a lot of soul searching over Beck.
[3:02:56.340 --> 3:03:03.060]  I know he's betrayed us a lot, said Ron Paul's bad even last year, said the FEMA camps aren't
[3:03:03.060 --> 3:03:07.300]  real when he knows that's a lie.
[3:03:07.300 --> 3:03:08.300]  More wars are good.
[3:03:08.300 --> 3:03:16.180]  I mean, he's a neocon, but he is doing a lot of good on exposing the fake environmental
[3:03:16.180 --> 3:03:26.260]  movement on exposing government-run healthcare and if he just kept going like he was going,
[3:03:26.260 --> 3:03:27.980]  he wouldn't be so bad.
[3:03:27.980 --> 3:03:32.300]  The problem is I've seen the way he turns on people and I know how he's taken over
[3:03:32.300 --> 3:03:35.780]  our movement so that they can direct it.
[3:03:35.780 --> 3:03:40.180]  And I just, so I hate bashing other media people.
[3:03:40.180 --> 3:03:41.780]  I don't spend a lot of time doing it.
[3:03:41.780 --> 3:03:50.020]  I don't get all vitriolically happy whenever Limbaugh is caught with drugs or in more trouble.
[3:03:50.020 --> 3:03:55.820]  But Glenn Beck is, he's dangerous.
[3:03:55.820 --> 3:04:01.060]  And I just want Glenn Beck to know that we're going to hold him accountable, that we're
[3:04:01.060 --> 3:04:05.660]  watching him, that we know what he's done, that we've chronicled and created catalogs
[3:04:05.660 --> 3:04:10.500]  of all of his flip-flopping and supporting the banker bailout and then saying he didn't
[3:04:10.500 --> 3:04:15.780]  and then saying he apologized when we pointed it out.
[3:04:15.780 --> 3:04:23.140]  I mean, I know he's an actor, he's a talented guy, and I wish him well, but I want him to
[3:04:23.140 --> 3:04:30.540]  know, I mean, obviously he's a lot better than Chris Matthews, who's openly evil.
[3:04:30.540 --> 3:04:34.140]  The problem is we know the Republican Party is just as bad as the Democratic Party at
[3:04:34.140 --> 3:04:36.660]  the leadership level, they're globalists.
[3:04:36.660 --> 3:04:40.140]  And so as long as Glenn Beck keeps explaining that, which he's doing more and more, that's
[3:04:40.140 --> 3:04:41.140]  a good thing.
[3:04:41.140 --> 3:04:45.140]  I mean, you know, I tuned in at two weeks, a week and a half ago, and he was saying 9-Eleven
[3:04:45.140 --> 3:04:47.420]  truthers are going to kill Obama.
[3:04:47.420 --> 3:04:53.340]  I mean, that is just slander because he knows it's an inside job and he's defending the
[3:04:53.340 --> 3:04:56.340]  military-industrial complex that states the attacks.
[3:04:56.340 --> 3:05:01.020]  We're watching you, Glenn Beck, let's know that.
[3:05:01.020 --> 3:05:04.980]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[3:05:04.980 --> 3:05:07.860]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[3:05:07.860 --> 3:05:09.940]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[3:06:00.780 --> 3:06:04.340]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[3:06:04.340 --> 3:06:05.340]  generator.
[3:06:05.340 --> 3:06:09.780]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:06:09.780 --> 3:06:14.100]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:06:14.100 --> 3:06:15.420]  allows you to have.
[3:06:15.420 --> 3:06:21.140]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:06:21.140 --> 3:06:25.460]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:06:25.460 --> 3:06:29.460]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:06:29.460 --> 3:06:32.940]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:06:32.940 --> 3:06:36.660]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[3:06:36.660 --> 3:06:41.380]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:06:41.380 --> 3:06:45.180]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:06:45.180 --> 3:06:46.580]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[3:06:46.580 --> 3:06:50.820]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[3:07:01.020 --> 3:07:02.900]  Hi everyone, Andy Anderson here.
[3:07:02.900 --> 3:07:07.340]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria and other nasties?
[3:07:07.340 --> 3:07:11.260]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy door knob, shopping carts
[3:07:11.260 --> 3:07:13.140]  and handrails we touch every day.
[3:07:13.140 --> 3:07:17.460]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[3:07:17.460 --> 3:07:19.420]  No more protection till you use it again.
[3:07:19.420 --> 3:07:20.660]  Pureworks to the rescue.
[3:07:20.660 --> 3:07:25.140]  Our FDA compliant foam, lotion, soap and spray do not contain alcohol.

[3:08:02.900 --> 3:08:09.460]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:09.460 --> 3:08:32.820]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:32.820 --> 3:08:37.540]  All right, we're back live here, ladies and gentlemen, had trouble with my earpiece getting
[3:08:37.540 --> 3:08:38.540]  in here.
[3:08:38.540 --> 3:08:43.140]  I took my jacket off to stretch and it got all new fangled and turned around.
[3:08:43.140 --> 3:08:44.900]  Boys, come in here and fix this for me.
[3:08:44.900 --> 3:08:46.860]  Thank you.
[3:08:46.860 --> 3:08:48.420]  Thank you so much.
[3:08:48.420 --> 3:08:56.980]  We are continuing with your phone calls and then I am going to, in a disciplined, disciplined
[3:08:56.980 --> 3:09:02.940]  fashion, go over all of the top news that I haven't even gotten to yet and then recap
[3:09:02.940 --> 3:09:04.580]  what happened with Geitner.
[3:09:04.580 --> 3:09:10.140]  We are continuing here today with your phone calls.
[3:09:10.140 --> 3:09:11.780]  Let's go to Matt in Ohio.
[3:09:11.780 --> 3:09:12.780]  Matt, you're on the air.
[3:09:12.780 --> 3:09:13.780]  Welcome.
[3:09:13.780 --> 3:09:14.780]  Thanks for holding.
[3:09:14.780 --> 3:09:15.780]  Hi, Alex.
[3:09:15.780 --> 3:09:16.780]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:09:16.780 --> 3:09:17.780]  Thanks for calling.
[3:09:17.780 --> 3:09:19.780]  I got one comment for you.
[3:09:19.780 --> 3:09:22.180]  Well, two comments and then just a couple quick questions.
[3:09:22.180 --> 3:09:27.700]  First, I really want to thank you for organizing the troops out in Austin because anytime someone
[3:09:27.700 --> 3:09:31.980]  defends the Second Amendment anywhere in the United States, they defend it for the rest
[3:09:31.980 --> 3:09:37.060]  of us everywhere else in the United States and I also want to commend all the people
[3:09:37.060 --> 3:09:39.940]  that came out and helped you.
[3:09:39.940 --> 3:09:40.940]  That's great.
[3:09:40.940 --> 3:09:42.740]  It is wonderful.
[3:09:42.740 --> 3:09:51.540]  The second thing, I heard you show when you were talking about going back in the danger
[3:09:51.540 --> 3:09:57.260]  of the population just kind of going over to the right, the conservative, the fake conservative
[3:09:57.260 --> 3:10:08.340]  movement and I think the 9-11 documentaries and the fake terror certainly helped to expose
[3:10:08.340 --> 3:10:09.980]  that aspect of it.
[3:10:09.980 --> 3:10:16.340]  That's why Cass Sunstein at the White House and Glenn Beck are going off the same talking
[3:10:16.340 --> 3:10:20.860]  points and the Homeland Security documents demonizing 9-11 truth.
[3:10:20.860 --> 3:10:27.300]  They know that if that fable, that legend, that hoax that we've got to give our rights
[3:10:27.300 --> 3:10:31.180]  up, or these foreign enemies will get us, their whole fraud of the naked body scanners,
[3:10:31.180 --> 3:10:33.980]  the police state, Northcom is built on that.
[3:10:33.980 --> 3:10:38.100]  Remember in the debate, the Republican primary debate, how the Republicans all lined up and
[3:10:38.100 --> 3:10:40.820]  demonized Ron Paul.
[3:10:40.820 --> 3:10:47.020]  There's a great article by Nate Blakesley in the, in the, I just saw it again last night
[3:10:47.020 --> 3:10:52.380]  in Texas Monthly where he chronicles what we all watched on television, but then behind
[3:10:52.380 --> 3:10:57.620]  the scenes how the Republicans were all just savaging him on the stage, off the stage because
[3:10:57.620 --> 3:10:59.580]  he was exposing the fraud of these wars.
[3:10:59.580 --> 3:11:04.860]  I mean, these are not conservatives and, and, and so just to understand, they're not going
[3:11:04.860 --> 3:11:08.780]  to reverse much of what Obama did and they're going to continue the police state once they
[3:11:08.780 --> 3:11:09.780]  get in power.
[3:11:09.780 --> 3:11:10.780]  Go ahead.
[3:11:10.780 --> 3:11:17.020]  Yeah, and I think where the Republicans are particularly, or the neocons, I, or to make
[3:11:17.020 --> 3:11:22.580]  the distinction, are particularly vulnerable is in their massive spending because the
[3:11:22.580 --> 3:11:27.340]  bank are bailout, tripling the size of government, claiming they're against it now.
[3:11:27.340 --> 3:11:28.340]  Absolutely.
[3:11:28.340 --> 3:11:33.460]  Yes, because there's a large number of just mainline conservatives who, who, who just
[3:11:33.460 --> 3:11:37.860]  won't open their eyes to 9-11 eventually they will, but right now they're just not ready,
[3:11:37.860 --> 3:11:44.020]  but you show them how much the neocons are spending, how far they're digging us into
[3:11:44.020 --> 3:11:46.140]  a debt that can never be repaid.
[3:11:46.140 --> 3:11:49.060]  And I think they'll revolt against going back in the others.
[3:11:49.060 --> 3:11:54.140]  Well, notice how Obama said, we're going to freeze discretionary spending.
[3:11:54.140 --> 3:11:58.580]  That means to the citizens, welfare, they've gotten us addicted, we're domesticated, now
[3:11:58.580 --> 3:12:01.660]  they're going to slaughter some of the hogs for Christmas.
[3:12:01.660 --> 3:12:06.180]  And so they're going to cut all of the benefits, cut the Medicare, cut the Medicaid as the
[3:12:06.180 --> 3:12:10.300]  taxes and revenue go up and up and up because it all goes to the bankers.
[3:12:10.300 --> 3:12:14.420]  So unlimited money to the bankers and the military industrial complex, more wars, the
[3:12:14.420 --> 3:12:19.740]  troops serving two, three, four, five, now some six tours in the last eight years.
[3:12:19.740 --> 3:12:25.620]  It goes on and on and on and on.
[3:12:25.620 --> 3:12:31.300]  And one thing in addition to the spending, I think if, if the mainline conservative understands
[3:12:31.300 --> 3:12:37.460]  that terrorism isn't a tactic that's meant to overthrow your military to destroy your
[3:12:37.460 --> 3:12:39.220]  government, obviously it can't do that.
[3:12:39.220 --> 3:12:45.060]  Instead, it's a tactic particularly designed to deplete your treasury to destroy your
[3:12:45.060 --> 3:12:46.060]  government.
[3:12:46.060 --> 3:12:49.740]  And then when they look and see the fact that, wow, we are doing exactly that, we're depleting
[3:12:49.740 --> 3:12:54.460]  our treasury in order to fight this terrorism, I think then people understand, gee, you
[3:12:54.460 --> 3:12:57.700]  know, maybe the terrorists are winning, not because, you know, they control-
[3:12:57.700 --> 3:13:02.860]  Yeah, but see, the central bankers want to bankrupt us to be into debt to them.
[3:13:02.860 --> 3:13:04.140]  They are the terrorists.
[3:13:04.140 --> 3:13:05.820]  They're staging most of the big terror attacks.
[3:13:05.820 --> 3:13:06.820]  I appreciate your call.
[3:13:06.820 --> 3:13:10.500]  I mean, it's far worse than that.
[3:13:10.500 --> 3:13:17.940]  Look, I respect Michael Savage because he will tell it like it is on many issues.
[3:13:17.940 --> 3:13:24.980]  I mean, he's light years ahead of Rush Limbaugh, light years ahead of Glenn Beck.
[3:13:24.980 --> 3:13:27.740]  He was against the Baker bailout.
[3:13:27.740 --> 3:13:33.740]  He, you know, has exposed the Patriot Act being used against American citizens.
[3:13:33.740 --> 3:13:36.860]  He calls it a new world order.
[3:13:36.860 --> 3:13:41.460]  But most importantly, he talks about Obama a year ago.
[3:13:41.460 --> 3:13:47.260]  When Obama was first elected, he said Obama will stage terror attacks as soon as his approval
[3:13:47.260 --> 3:13:50.220]  rating plunges and people find out who he is.
[3:13:50.220 --> 3:13:51.980]  Savage knew like I knew a year ago.
[3:13:51.980 --> 3:13:55.780]  Well, I even knew before Obama got elected, he was going to be the guy who started the
[3:13:55.780 --> 3:13:58.460]  film the day he was elected, Obama Deception, started making it.
[3:13:58.460 --> 3:14:04.620]  It was out in early March of 2009.
[3:14:04.620 --> 3:14:07.820]  But he knew they were going to stage terror attacks, and they are.
[3:14:07.820 --> 3:14:12.100]  And now seeing Bin Laden's alive, here's a new tape, a new fake tape, and oh, the underwear
[3:14:12.100 --> 3:14:14.300]  bombing clearly staged.
[3:14:14.300 --> 3:14:18.940]  Now the FBI has had to admit all those things that Kurt Haskell said were all true.
[3:14:18.940 --> 3:14:26.540]  In fact, if we called Kurt Haskell, is he coming on because he was totally vindicated.
[3:14:26.540 --> 3:14:29.620]  They completely caved in at a minute he was right now.
[3:14:29.620 --> 3:14:31.620]  I mean, this is incredible.
[3:14:31.620 --> 3:14:33.500]  Okay, good, good, good.
[3:14:33.500 --> 3:14:39.180]  I just want to remind you guys, you know, that broke Sunday seeing in the FBI goes, okay,
[3:14:39.180 --> 3:14:41.820]  there was a second guy we detained and the rest, we won't tell you who he is.
[3:14:41.820 --> 3:14:42.820]  Forget about it.
[3:14:42.820 --> 3:14:43.820]  We were watching him.
[3:14:43.820 --> 3:14:44.820]  He was on a no fly list.
[3:14:44.820 --> 3:14:45.820]  We let him on.
[3:14:45.820 --> 3:14:47.300]  Yeah, there might have been a bomb.
[3:14:47.300 --> 3:14:50.780]  I mean, you know, just, oh, yeah, sharp dress, man, oh, you know, just on and on.
[3:14:50.780 --> 3:14:53.780]  Oh, somebody videotaping the whole event.
[3:14:53.780 --> 3:15:03.740]  But the issue that I'm trying to get at with the last caller is we know that they are staging
[3:15:03.740 --> 3:15:04.740]  terror attacks.
[3:15:04.740 --> 3:15:07.480]  We know that their approval writing was going to go down.
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:11.100]  We understood this whole messianic thing was the front that was going to fall apart.
[3:15:11.100 --> 3:15:13.220]  We knew he wasn't going to deliver.
[3:15:13.220 --> 3:15:18.500]  Now, Glenn Beck saying I'm bad and that 9 11 truthers want to kill Obama with no evidence.
[3:15:18.500 --> 3:15:23.820]  Just saying it almost every day on the radio, oh, secret service protect Obama from the
[3:15:23.820 --> 3:15:24.820]  9 11 truthers.
[3:15:24.820 --> 3:15:26.220]  Like we're terrorist.
[3:15:26.220 --> 3:15:28.020]  That's a talking point.
[3:15:28.020 --> 3:15:33.220]  He's been following since 2007 that Ron Paul supporters are going to bomb buildings that
[3:15:33.220 --> 3:15:40.420]  Ron Paul supporters are these dangerous 9 11 truthers that Ron Paul supporters want terrorism
[3:15:40.420 --> 3:15:44.740]  that Ron Paul supporters want to work with Al Qaeda when we're saying it isn't even real
[3:15:44.740 --> 3:15:51.620]  because the history shows that the facts on and on and on and on and on and on and now
[3:15:51.620 --> 3:15:56.140]  of Obama stages a terror attack and I try to come out against it.
[3:15:56.140 --> 3:15:59.740]  I'll guarantee you Glenn Beck's going to be saying I'm bad.
[3:15:59.740 --> 3:16:01.420]  That guy will flip on you in a minute.
[3:16:01.420 --> 3:16:08.540]  That's he flip flops like a flounder and what am I supposed to do here?
[3:16:08.540 --> 3:16:10.700]  I mean, it's, it's, it's elementary.
[3:16:10.700 --> 3:16:13.140]  It's elementary information.
[3:16:13.140 --> 3:16:14.940]  Okay.
[3:16:14.940 --> 3:16:18.820]  Our government's declassified over 200 times at stage terror attacks.
[3:16:18.820 --> 3:16:19.860]  It's admitted.
[3:16:19.860 --> 3:16:26.320]  It's in army manuals for captains and above in special ops, how to stage false flags.
[3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:27.620]  It's in the manuals.
[3:16:27.620 --> 3:16:29.140]  They do it.
[3:16:29.140 --> 3:16:31.580]  It's a tool of war.
[3:16:31.580 --> 3:16:35.100]  And here's the coup de gras for everybody out there in denial.
[3:16:35.100 --> 3:16:36.100]  All the fake conservatives.
[3:16:36.100 --> 3:16:38.020]  Let me break your conditioning right now.
[3:16:38.020 --> 3:16:43.860]  If all of that doesn't wake you up, does this wake you up?
[3:16:43.860 --> 3:16:46.620]  My act, Homeland Security documents.
[3:16:46.620 --> 3:16:51.220]  Remember those last year that gun owners, veterans, libertarians, conservatives, returning
[3:16:51.220 --> 3:16:58.820]  veterans are the number one threat and Homeland Security is set up for us.
[3:16:58.820 --> 3:17:02.580]  The whole thing is set up for you.
[3:17:02.580 --> 3:17:08.940]  Not the CIA asset admittedly former CIA asset, current CIA asset, dead in the ground, Osama
[3:17:08.940 --> 3:17:09.940]  bin Laden.
[3:17:09.940 --> 3:17:12.700]  I mean, it's elementary.
[3:17:12.700 --> 3:17:16.140]  The fake bin Laden tapes, they admit her fake over and over again, and they think you're
[3:17:16.140 --> 3:17:17.140]  so stupid.
[3:17:17.140 --> 3:17:18.140]  They put them out.
[3:17:18.140 --> 3:17:23.900]  They are playing you just like Obama supporters are being played by Obama.
[3:17:23.900 --> 3:17:24.900]  Just stop being chomps.
[3:17:24.900 --> 3:17:25.900]  I mean, come on.
[3:17:25.900 --> 3:17:30.460]  Who's up next here, John Roman in Indiana.
[3:17:30.460 --> 3:17:31.460]  You're on the air.
[3:17:31.460 --> 3:17:32.460]  Go ahead.
[3:17:32.460 --> 3:17:33.460]  Yes, Alex.
[3:17:33.460 --> 3:17:34.460]  I'm glad.
[3:17:34.460 --> 3:17:39.220]  First time caller, longtime listener, and I'd like to bring out a few points about the
[3:17:39.220 --> 3:17:45.660]  family and how did this evil systems trying to destroy it.
[3:17:45.660 --> 3:17:53.380]  You know, I'm in one of the poorest counties of the state of Indiana, if not the poorest.
[3:17:53.380 --> 3:17:55.980]  And the CPS is hunting the families.
[3:17:55.980 --> 3:18:02.420]  Oh, and the dark side is really strong in these counties because they seem to be the
[3:18:02.420 --> 3:18:05.540]  people pushed to people around really evil moves.
[3:18:05.540 --> 3:18:07.300]  It likes weak dependent people.
[3:18:07.300 --> 3:18:08.300]  Yes.
[3:18:08.300 --> 3:18:17.980]  And, uh, well, um, I'm also a VFW member and a veteran of the Vietnam War era.
[3:18:17.980 --> 3:18:25.940]  I, uh, you know, I've, I'm trying to get the VFW to come out from under this 503 5013
[3:18:25.940 --> 3:18:34.940]  fact that the entered with these globalists, because to me, if you go to the notice, notice
[3:18:34.940 --> 3:18:39.740]  all the charities and organizations, they can't be involved politically, but offshore
[3:18:39.740 --> 3:18:43.620]  corporations, they can give unlimited money.
[3:18:43.620 --> 3:18:44.620]  Yes.
[3:18:44.620 --> 3:18:45.620]  Yes.
[3:18:45.620 --> 3:18:52.140]  And, you know, and it's, it's, it's, it's, you know, basically it's a, it's a, um, um,
[3:18:52.140 --> 3:18:54.660]  kind of get rid of our first amendment rights.
[3:18:54.660 --> 3:19:00.940]  You know, a virus, a virus or a bacteria likes to breed in a weak body.
[3:19:00.940 --> 3:19:03.700]  The globalists want to make you weak before they drink your blood.
[3:19:03.700 --> 3:19:04.700]  Go ahead.
[3:19:04.700 --> 3:19:05.700]  Yes.
[3:19:05.700 --> 3:19:13.220]  And, and, you know, I, I, I went to that battle of Athens, Tennessee to me, that's the way
[3:19:13.220 --> 3:19:19.580]  the VFW should react to this stuff, not be combined to cages because of a legal pack.
[3:19:19.580 --> 3:19:26.580]  Well, number one, even if you sign a 501 C three to be a charity, they, they misappropriate
[3:19:26.580 --> 3:19:27.580]  it.
[3:19:27.580 --> 3:19:29.300]  You're allowed to say I'm against gun control.
[3:19:29.300 --> 3:19:31.940]  You're allowed as members to say we're against open borders.
[3:19:31.940 --> 3:19:35.900]  They just tell you, you're not allowed to talk about politics as a way to make sure all
[3:19:35.900 --> 3:19:37.740]  the veterans are controlled.
[3:19:37.740 --> 3:19:39.700]  They're the people you're afraid of.
[3:19:39.700 --> 3:19:40.700]  Exactly.
[3:19:40.700 --> 3:19:46.820]  That, that's my point that I'm trying to wake, awake at least my, my post up to get
[3:19:46.820 --> 3:19:49.780]  out there and say enough for enough.
[3:19:49.780 --> 3:19:50.780]  Well God bless you.
[3:19:50.780 --> 3:19:51.780]  Keep it up.
[3:19:51.780 --> 3:19:54.900]  But you guys already have the power to speak out freely as individual members.
[3:19:54.900 --> 3:19:57.820]  So just bypass that false psychological barrier.
[3:19:57.820 --> 3:20:01.820]  We'll be right back.
[3:20:01.820 --> 3:20:07.860]  Attention, an important product from hempusa.org micro plant powder will change your life by

[3:20:18.500 --> 3:20:23.460]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica and packed with a negative charge that attracts positive

[3:20:31.420 --> 3:20:32.780]  to the joints.

[3:21:03.020 --> 3:21:06.300]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:21:06.300 --> 3:21:09.620]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:21:09.620 --> 3:21:14.260]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[3:21:14.260 --> 3:21:15.260]  at home.
[3:21:15.260 --> 3:21:19.900]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[3:21:19.900 --> 3:21:20.900]  calling the shots.
[3:21:20.900 --> 3:21:26.220]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:21:26.220 --> 3:21:31.700]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[3:21:31.700 --> 3:21:36.380]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:21:36.380 --> 3:21:38.820]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:21:38.820 --> 3:21:42.980]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:21:42.980 --> 3:21:48.820]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:21:48.820 --> 3:21:49.820]  of the Republic.
[3:21:49.820 --> 3:21:54.500]  Yet your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:21:54.500 --> 3:22:01.420]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:22:01.420 --> 3:22:06.420]  Originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity,
[3:22:06.420 --> 3:22:11.220]  content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[3:22:11.220 --> 3:22:15.900]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system.
[3:22:15.900 --> 3:22:20.260]  Wisdom being lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit
[3:22:20.260 --> 3:22:24.780]  has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our
[3:22:24.780 --> 3:22:26.860]  country ever experienced.
[3:22:26.860 --> 3:22:30.820]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our
[3:22:30.820 --> 3:22:35.180]  elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original
[3:22:35.180 --> 3:22:36.180]  value.
[3:22:36.180 --> 3:22:40.660]  The foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[3:22:40.660 --> 3:22:42.260]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[3:22:42.260 --> 3:22:45.260]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[3:22:45.260 --> 3:22:49.300]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[3:22:49.300 --> 3:22:52.780]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[3:22:52.780 --> 3:23:01.580]  Call today at 800-686-2237, again that's 800-686-2237.
[3:23:01.580 --> 3:23:04.940]  Americans have heard much about change in recent times and are now waking up to the
[3:23:04.940 --> 3:23:05.940]  truth.
[3:23:05.940 --> 3:23:08.820]  Let's discuss a few facts about your food you may want to change.
[3:23:08.820 --> 3:23:13.500]  Did you know that nearly 100% of the food on store shelves comes from a few corporations
[3:23:13.500 --> 3:23:18.220]  and that most is genetically engineered, chemically sprayed and transported great distances?
[3:23:18.220 --> 3:23:22.780]  Baker Creek Air Loom Seed Company, like you, wants to see Americans change and take control
[3:23:22.780 --> 3:23:25.660]  of their own food supply, one seed at a time.
[3:23:25.660 --> 3:23:30.620]  Over 12 years, we've become America's premier supplier of pure, non-GMO seeds with over
[3:23:30.620 --> 3:23:32.420]  1,400 varieties.
[3:23:32.420 --> 3:23:36.660]  Gardeners and homesteaders know Baker Creek offers some of the most popular seed collection
[3:23:36.660 --> 3:23:42.100]  kits, like our large heirloom kit with 60 full-size seed packets for only $99.
[3:23:42.100 --> 3:23:46.300]  The kit contains 25 types of vegetables and comes packaged in a metal can for long-term
[3:23:46.300 --> 3:23:48.780]  storage for just $99.
[3:23:48.780 --> 3:23:51.980]  Look for our free catalog today at rareseeds.com.
[3:23:51.980 --> 3:23:56.100]  That's rareseeds.com or call 1-866-OLD-SEED.
[3:23:56.100 --> 3:24:21.580]  That's one, eight, six, six, six, five, three, seven, three, three, three, today.
[3:24:21.580 --> 3:24:31.980]  Let's go to Joseph in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:24:31.980 --> 3:24:36.420]  Hi, Alex, I just wanted to touch on two issues.
[3:24:36.420 --> 3:24:41.260]  One would be that it seems strange that you're mentioning about how the media is controlled
[3:24:41.260 --> 3:24:48.260]  too, and I really think that it's something out of that movie they live every day.
[3:24:48.260 --> 3:24:53.500]  Second, also I was going to say, I think maybe you should do a whole segment or maybe even
[3:24:53.500 --> 3:24:59.700]  a movie on that about just how insanely the media and the news is controlled.
[3:24:59.700 --> 3:25:08.220]  I've said for years I want to make a film about propaganda, and that's been my intention
[3:25:08.220 --> 3:25:16.060]  for more than 12 years, so yes, that is in the realm of the future.
[3:25:16.060 --> 3:25:22.380]  I know people that have taken marketing and sociology, and they said they've never even
[3:25:22.380 --> 3:25:31.580]  heard of Edward Bernays, and he's one of the most influential people of the propaganda.
[3:25:31.580 --> 3:25:38.900]  I think they must have gone and gotten the cheat sheets then because baseline marketing,
[3:25:38.900 --> 3:25:44.140]  baseline RTF teaches it out of the gates.
[3:25:44.140 --> 3:25:51.260]  Yeah, they're like on their second year, and they have no clue who the guy is, but I mean
[3:25:51.260 --> 3:25:55.140]  the same thing goes with Tesla.
[3:25:55.140 --> 3:25:57.140]  I hear you, Joseph, I appreciate your call.
[3:25:57.140 --> 3:25:59.140]  Ricky and Georgia, you're on the air.
[3:25:59.140 --> 3:26:02.140]  Yeah, hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[3:26:02.140 --> 3:26:03.140]  Welcome.
[3:26:03.140 --> 3:26:04.980]  I just had two quick points.
[3:26:04.980 --> 3:26:11.340]  One, for anybody who doubts the power of marketing control over us, especially over women, needs
[3:26:11.340 --> 3:26:17.780]  only look at how many times the mascara brush has been reinvented, and the main reason why
[3:26:17.780 --> 3:26:25.260]  I call it today is I had an idea to help in the mission to expose Glenn Beck for what
[3:26:25.260 --> 3:26:27.020]  he really is.
[3:26:27.020 --> 3:26:36.500]  Given the success of the Joker poster and given your propensity for Batman references,
[3:26:36.500 --> 3:26:44.220]  another villain that I think fits the bill with Glenn Beck is Two-Face.
[3:26:44.220 --> 3:26:51.420]  I thought of an image I can't draw, so otherwise I would have sent it to you, but to do an
[3:26:51.420 --> 3:26:57.260]  image where it's Glenn Beck, and half of him is Glenn Beck, the other half is evil
[3:26:57.260 --> 3:27:03.340]  Two-Face, of course, he's flipping a coin, and the coin could say New World Order on
[3:27:03.340 --> 3:27:12.060]  it with the unfinished pyramid, and underneath the image it says, heads we win, tails you
[3:27:12.060 --> 3:27:13.060]  lose.
[3:27:13.060 --> 3:27:16.780]  I just wanted to know what you thought about that.
[3:27:16.780 --> 3:27:17.780]  Very interesting.
[3:27:17.780 --> 3:27:21.900]  That's the power of graphic designers out there, and you go all over the Internet, not
[3:27:21.900 --> 3:27:28.700]  just on infowars.com or prismpunna.com, but on mainline sites that are covering race car
[3:27:28.700 --> 3:27:34.340]  driving or gardening, you see people in the message boards talking about the New World
[3:27:34.340 --> 3:27:40.460]  Order and posting amazing graphics, and so we really are winning the culture war.
[3:27:40.460 --> 3:27:45.140]  I mean, I mentioned earlier how Newsday, one of the biggest media outfits in the country,
[3:27:45.140 --> 3:27:52.500]  went to subscription-based three weeks ago and only got 35 members.
[3:27:52.500 --> 3:27:57.860]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I can plug prismplanet.tv one time and get 35 members.
[3:27:57.860 --> 3:28:01.620]  I mean, that's the point, no one supports these people.
[3:28:01.620 --> 3:28:08.460]  They are a paper tiger, and the big fraud is, to be in a major newspaper, even something
[3:28:08.460 --> 3:28:14.900]  like the Statesman here in Austin, and to have a full-page ad in the back is $10,000
[3:28:14.900 --> 3:28:23.020]  or more, and to have the equivalent ad and reach as many people on infowars.com, it'd
[3:28:23.020 --> 3:28:24.860]  be about 50 bucks.
[3:28:24.860 --> 3:28:32.420]  See, the last illusion to fall, I appreciate your call, let me explain this this way.
[3:28:32.420 --> 3:28:39.300]  When I go on CNN or Fox, I get almost no response in web traffic, video sales, anything
[3:28:39.300 --> 3:28:42.020]  we can gauge traffic by.
[3:28:42.020 --> 3:28:48.020]  I go on a mom and pop AM Christian radio station for an hour as a guest, say the videos are
[3:28:48.020 --> 3:28:53.500]  free on the web, but if you want them better quality and support me, buy the DVD at infowars.com
[3:28:53.500 --> 3:29:00.900]  and I might get 30, 40 hours, some 1000 watt in a little town, because these are real humans
[3:29:00.900 --> 3:29:04.860]  that aren't mesmerized tuning into radio, which hits a totally different area of the
[3:29:04.860 --> 3:29:12.020]  brain where they're actually consciously engaged TV, watchers or zombies.
[3:29:12.020 --> 3:29:16.980]  And so that's what I'm trying to say is, you've got these big global corporations that patronize
[3:29:16.980 --> 3:29:19.780]  mainstream media to put their propaganda out.
[3:29:19.780 --> 3:29:22.980]  They know they're not getting the full return back.
[3:29:22.980 --> 3:29:23.980]  They know.
[3:29:23.980 --> 3:29:29.580]  I mean, some advertising is different, like watches or cars, they tend to actually get
[3:29:29.580 --> 3:29:30.780]  money back from it.
[3:29:30.780 --> 3:29:35.900]  But when you see Archer Daniels Midland or Monsanto ads telling you how great they are,
[3:29:35.900 --> 3:29:41.220]  or you see Lockheed Martin Marietta defense contractor ads, they're not selling F111 stealth
[3:29:41.220 --> 3:29:42.620]  bombers to you.
[3:29:42.620 --> 3:29:47.140]  They're not selling selling GMO to the average person, they're just propagandizing and paying
[3:29:47.140 --> 3:29:48.140]  off the media.
[3:29:48.140 --> 3:29:49.140]  We'll be back.
[3:29:49.140 --> 3:29:51.820]  Stay with us.
[3:29:51.820 --> 3:29:55.540]  Here on the March, the empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.540 --> 3:29:59.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:29:59.140 --> 3:30:06.940]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:30:06.940 --> 3:30:11.780]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[3:30:11.780 --> 3:30:15.780]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[3:30:15.780 --> 3:30:20.420]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[3:30:20.420 --> 3:30:25.660]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[3:30:25.660 --> 3:30:31.920]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[3:30:31.920 --> 3:30:36.260]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[3:30:36.260 --> 3:30:41.580]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:30:41.580 --> 3:30:46.820]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[3:30:46.820 --> 3:30:53.100]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[3:30:53.100 --> 3:30:54.420]  Lungs Generator.
[3:30:54.420 --> 3:31:02.860]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[3:31:02.860 --> 3:31:07.020]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:31:07.020 --> 3:31:10.180]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:31:10.180 --> 3:31:14.500]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:31:14.500 --> 3:31:15.500]  at home.
[3:31:15.500 --> 3:31:20.500]  We've turned an endless influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[3:31:20.500 --> 3:31:21.500]  the shots.
[3:31:21.500 --> 3:31:26.500]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:31:26.500 --> 3:31:31.940]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[3:31:31.940 --> 3:31:36.660]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:31:36.660 --> 3:31:40.980]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[3:31:40.980 --> 3:31:42.980]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:31:42.980 --> 3:31:49.060]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:31:49.060 --> 3:31:50.060]  of the Republic.
[3:31:50.060 --> 3:31:54.820]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:31:54.820 --> 3:32:01.380]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:32:01.380 --> 3:32:03.820]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[3:32:03.820 --> 3:32:05.660]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[3:32:05.660 --> 3:32:07.500]  No more mortgage can change your life.
[3:32:07.500 --> 3:32:08.940]  We paid off all of our bills.
[3:32:08.940 --> 3:32:11.740]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years?
[3:32:11.740 --> 3:32:17.460]  With no more mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[3:32:17.460 --> 3:32:19.060]  Even have more money left over each month?
[3:32:19.060 --> 3:32:22.780]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[3:32:22.780 --> 3:32:23.780]  No more mortgage.
[3:32:23.780 --> 3:32:25.420]  Where have they been all of our life?
[3:32:25.420 --> 3:32:27.980]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[3:32:27.980 --> 3:32:31.700]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[3:32:31.700 --> 3:32:33.740]  I'm Larry Ruff, President of No More Mortgage.

[3:32:56.260 --> 3:32:57.260]  Big John.
[3:32:57.260 --> 3:32:58.260]  Big John.
[3:32:58.260 --> 3:33:12.300]  Every morning at the mine, you could see him arrive, he stood six-foot-six and weighed
[3:33:12.300 --> 3:33:17.220]  two-forty-five, kind of broad at the shoulder, narrowed the hip, and everybody knew you
[3:33:17.220 --> 3:33:20.220]  didn't give no lift to Big John.
[3:33:20.220 --> 3:33:21.220]  Big John.
[3:33:21.220 --> 3:33:22.220]  Big John.
[3:33:22.220 --> 3:33:29.220]  Big John.
[3:33:29.220 --> 3:33:30.220]  Big John.
[3:33:30.220 --> 3:33:31.220]  All right.
[3:33:31.220 --> 3:33:32.220]  We are back live.
[3:33:32.220 --> 3:33:37.220]  I'm going to news splits now here, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:33:37.220 --> 3:33:41.100]  Want to first tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible, and
[3:33:41.100 --> 3:33:44.900]  I believe in all of these sponsors, eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:33:44.900 --> 3:33:49.900]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive, and our great sponsor, eFoods
[3:33:49.900 --> 3:33:53.580]  Direct, is the long-s continually operating, storeable foods company in the country.
[3:33:53.580 --> 3:33:56.620]  They also happen to be true patriots, and have supported the freedom movement for years
[3:33:56.620 --> 3:33:57.620]  and years.
[3:33:57.620 --> 3:34:01.660]  They have incredible lines of already prepared meals, raw meals.
[3:34:01.660 --> 3:34:06.220]  It is the place, and they produce their food every month, brand new, not some 10-year-old
[3:34:06.220 --> 3:34:07.220]  crud.
[3:34:07.220 --> 3:34:10.460]  A lot of people out there, you know, like to say they're the best.
[3:34:10.460 --> 3:34:11.780]  Well, this is the best I've found.
[3:34:11.780 --> 3:34:13.300]  This is the real deal.
[3:34:13.300 --> 3:34:20.500]  eFoodsDirect.com, or give them a call at 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or check out the big banners
[3:34:20.500 --> 3:34:29.140]  on infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com, continuing on to tell you about survivalseedbank.com.
[3:34:29.140 --> 3:34:33.100]  Everybody should buy one of these, plant it this spring, but buy another and save it.
[3:34:33.100 --> 3:34:34.420]  Get good at gardening.
[3:34:34.420 --> 3:34:39.300]  The journey of 1,000 miles is the old Chinese proverb states, starts with a single step,
[3:34:39.300 --> 3:34:42.820]  and just getting back to gardening, turning the TV off a few hours a day on Saturday and
[3:34:42.820 --> 3:34:49.940]  Sunday is just a wonderful thing to do, and to grow some non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds.
[3:34:49.940 --> 3:34:54.060]  The globalists are buying up all the little seed companies, hoarding it at U.N. facilities.
[3:34:54.060 --> 3:34:55.060]  People don't believe me about that.
[3:34:55.060 --> 3:34:56.060]  You can just Google it.
[3:34:56.060 --> 3:34:57.060]  It's like Reuters AP.
[3:34:57.060 --> 3:35:01.180]  In fact, pull up U.N. Seed Vault Arctic Circle.
[3:35:01.180 --> 3:35:03.060]  It'll be like a Reuters article.
[3:35:03.060 --> 3:35:09.660]  It'll show the new Secretary General touring it, troops guarding it from you.
[3:35:09.660 --> 3:35:18.500]  The point is, survivalseedbank.com, 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[3:35:18.500 --> 3:35:25.380]  And last but not least, I want to tell you about Coloblue, the atmospheric water generator,
[3:35:25.380 --> 3:35:28.700]  because of the overwhelming need in Haiti, they've already shipped one of their giant
[3:35:28.700 --> 3:35:29.700]  units over there.
[3:35:29.700 --> 3:35:36.820]  A Coloblue is donating 20% of every a Coloblue 28 and a Coloblue 30 sold to Convoy of Hope,
[3:35:36.820 --> 3:35:39.820]  which is a good charity to benefit the relief efforts in Haiti.
[3:35:39.820 --> 3:35:41.340]  Convoy of Hope already works in Haiti.
[3:35:41.340 --> 3:35:42.340]  It's a real charity.
[3:35:42.340 --> 3:35:46.420]  A Coloblue has already donated a commercial-sized atmospheric water generator and power generator
[3:35:46.420 --> 3:35:49.500]  to provide an infinite supply of water to many Haitians.
[3:35:49.500 --> 3:35:53.300]  Because of the capital's freshwater supply system was destroyed by the earthquake, lights
[3:35:53.300 --> 3:35:57.620]  of saving pure water is of paramount importance.
[3:35:57.620 --> 3:36:01.700]  So every purchase you make, 20% goes to that.
[3:36:01.700 --> 3:36:08.860]  Coloblue.com, or give them a call at 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, or there's a big banner up
[3:36:08.860 --> 3:36:15.820]  on infowars.com, okay.
[3:36:15.820 --> 3:36:19.540]  Health cares in deep trouble, can be beaten, we've got to put major heat on them to make
[3:36:19.540 --> 3:36:24.140]  sure that falls apart and let all the Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate
[3:36:24.140 --> 3:36:27.860]  know you're going to be voting against them and campaigning against them if they let the
[3:36:27.860 --> 3:36:33.060]  insurance companies and banks take over, raise taxes, put people in prison if they don't
[3:36:33.060 --> 3:36:37.860]  buy health care, control health care, water health care down, cut Medicare and Medicaid.
[3:36:37.860 --> 3:36:40.900]  That's one of the big final dominoes we haven't beaten.
[3:36:40.900 --> 3:36:45.140]  Geithner's on the verge of being kicked out, Bernanke may not get re-approved, make sure
[3:36:45.140 --> 3:36:49.500]  you call Congress on that, Geithner was absolutely grilled along with Henry Paulson, they're
[3:36:49.500 --> 3:36:55.180]  both crooks, they need to go to prison, and I covered that in the first hour of the show
[3:36:55.180 --> 3:37:01.420]  with the tale of you missed it, the retransmissions coming up in T-minus 24 minutes.
[3:37:01.420 --> 3:37:05.580]  Getting into other news that I've not yet covered, I mentioned this but I want to get
[3:37:05.580 --> 3:37:08.620]  into it more right now.
[3:37:08.620 --> 3:37:14.820]  Send California inmates to Mexico says Schwarzenegger, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger suggested
[3:37:14.820 --> 3:37:21.780]  Californians could ease its crowded prison system, half of their systems full of illegal
[3:37:21.780 --> 3:37:27.780]  aliens by sending thousands of undocumented inmates, especially built jails in Mexico.
[3:37:27.780 --> 3:37:32.420]  And then he goes on to say that California would pay for the prisons, well they're already
[3:37:32.420 --> 3:37:36.720]  set up a North American hemispheric ID card that you can get right now, they're already
[3:37:36.720 --> 3:37:41.300]  merging the security and police apparatus, this was talked about in the SPP documents
[3:37:41.300 --> 3:37:50.980]  from 2007, 2006 and 2005, and so how about we take the illegal aliens and bust them up
[3:37:50.980 --> 3:37:56.460]  to the border and order the Mexicans to take them, see the criminals in Mexico, the people
[3:37:56.460 --> 3:38:03.400]  fleeing the bank robbers, the murderers, the rapists, the arsonists, the crazies, imaginative
[3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:09.660]  Mexico would take all U.S. criminals, people would then run to Mexico, and in the past
[3:38:09.660 --> 3:38:17.020]  gringos could run down to Mexico, and that's where criminals went, well it's the same thing.
[3:38:17.020 --> 3:38:21.700]  And that's what's happening is that all these criminals and others are coming up here and
[3:38:21.700 --> 3:38:27.420]  then we have to pay for it, and we also have to get mugged and killed and robbed and looted.
[3:38:27.420 --> 3:38:32.380]  And every major Californian city is a sanctuary city like Austin, Texas, they don't get arrested
[3:38:32.380 --> 3:38:36.600]  for DWI, they don't get arrested for no ID, they're told leave it alone.
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:41.980]  But citizens are thrown to the wolves, citizens are arrested.
[3:38:41.980 --> 3:38:47.260]  I mean our city is completely lawless.
[3:38:47.260 --> 3:38:50.700]  Speaking to reporters, the Sacramento Press Club, Schwarzenegger said California could
[3:38:50.700 --> 3:38:55.460]  ease its strained finance by billions of dollars if 20,000 illegal immigrants currently held
[3:38:55.460 --> 3:38:57.660]  the state were housed across the border.
[3:38:57.660 --> 3:39:04.260]  I think we can do some better if the prison system alone, if we can go and take inmates,
[3:39:04.260 --> 3:39:08.020]  for instance 20,000 inmates, they're illegal immigrants that are held here and get them
[3:39:08.020 --> 3:39:09.340]  to Mexico.
[3:39:09.340 --> 3:39:10.340]  Think about it.
[3:39:10.340 --> 3:39:17.220]  If California gives Mexico the money, not hey, you take care of them.
[3:39:17.220 --> 3:39:18.220]  These are your citizens.
[3:39:18.220 --> 3:39:19.740]  No, no, not at all.
[3:39:19.740 --> 3:39:23.540]  I mean, just the guy's retarded, I mean, I'm sorry.
[3:39:23.540 --> 3:39:27.740]  We pay them to build a prison down in Mexico.
[3:39:27.740 --> 3:39:32.780]  And then, then, then, then, we have those undocumented immigrants down there in prison.
[3:39:32.780 --> 3:39:34.740]  Yeah, I'm sure that's going to happen.
[3:39:34.740 --> 3:39:39.100]  It would have to cost to build the prison and run the prison.
[3:39:39.100 --> 3:39:45.060]  We could save a billion dollars right that could go into higher education.
[3:39:45.060 --> 3:39:47.140]  Yes, brainwashed the kids more.
[3:39:47.140 --> 3:39:48.140]  That's what we need.
[3:39:48.140 --> 3:39:50.260]  The more money they spend, the dumber they get.
[3:39:50.260 --> 3:39:53.980]  So I mean, that's just the type of crud.
[3:39:53.980 --> 3:40:01.740]  We don't dare ship illegal criminals out, no, no, no, no, no.
[3:40:01.740 --> 3:40:05.660]  I mean, instantly, they could say, we're not accepting your consulate matriculas.
[3:40:05.660 --> 3:40:10.980]  We're not letting your illegals wire 50 plus billion home a year if you don't take criminals
[3:40:10.980 --> 3:40:17.140]  and pay for it yourself.
[3:40:17.140 --> 3:40:21.020]  But the globalist love butchering America, so they're going to continue to let the entire
[3:40:21.020 --> 3:40:24.740]  third world criminal mass move here.
[3:40:24.740 --> 3:40:27.060]  And then they're going to, you're going to vote for more police and then they're going
[3:40:27.060 --> 3:40:30.300]  to be there to feed off you and write you tickets and if they pull an illegal over by
[3:40:30.300 --> 3:40:37.020]  accident and just go ahead and go, you can go ahead and go now.
[3:40:37.020 --> 3:40:41.300]  Already mentioned airline suffered record drop in traveling 2009 because of the naked
[3:40:41.300 --> 3:40:42.540]  body scanners and other things.
[3:40:42.540 --> 3:40:43.540]  People are sick of it.
[3:40:43.540 --> 3:40:48.100]  Dying news media looks to Apple tablet for hope.
[3:40:48.100 --> 3:40:52.020]  They think now that because they'll have an Apple tablet that people carry around that
[3:40:52.020 --> 3:40:55.140]  suddenly they're going to want to read the mainstream newspapers or subscribe.
[3:40:55.140 --> 3:40:59.260]  Well that is disproven by this little gym that I want to spend some more time on them
[3:40:59.260 --> 3:41:00.260]  and get some news.
[3:41:00.260 --> 3:41:01.260]  I haven't gotten to yet.
[3:41:01.260 --> 3:41:07.380]  Let me close shot on this document cam after three months, only 35 subscriptions for news
[3:41:07.380 --> 3:41:08.380]  day website.
[3:41:08.380 --> 3:41:18.540]  Again, another giant hoax is that the newspapers are falling apart because of the internet.
[3:41:18.540 --> 3:41:21.540]  No, no, that's a small part of it.
[3:41:21.540 --> 3:41:26.820]  It's because people are sick of you and your distortions and they don't want to support
[3:41:26.820 --> 3:41:27.820]  you.
[3:41:27.820 --> 3:41:30.740]  There are alternative newspapers doing gangbusters.
[3:41:30.740 --> 3:41:34.700]  People will pay for something they trust for something that's informative.
[3:41:34.700 --> 3:41:38.300]  They will not pay for crud.
[3:41:38.300 --> 3:41:40.860]  People will pay for a prison planet dot TV membership.
[3:41:40.860 --> 3:41:44.460]  They got all the films, my book, Watson's book, the live streaming TV show.
[3:41:44.460 --> 3:41:46.060]  They understand what this cost.
[3:41:46.060 --> 3:41:47.060]  They know what we're doing.
[3:41:47.060 --> 3:41:48.100]  They want to support us.
[3:41:48.100 --> 3:41:50.220]  They know what we're doing is good.
[3:41:50.220 --> 3:41:52.740]  They are not going to support you.
[3:41:52.740 --> 3:41:55.260]  35 subscribers.
[3:41:55.260 --> 3:41:59.460]  Every news day is gigantic.
[3:41:59.460 --> 3:42:03.340]  I mean, I've looked at the statistics, but it's got to be in the top 15 or so media outlets
[3:42:03.340 --> 3:42:04.340]  in the country.
[3:42:04.340 --> 3:42:07.380]  I know it's the biggest thing in New York, the third most popular state.
[3:42:07.380 --> 3:42:13.140]  I mean, it is just giant and they can't get 35 subscriptions.
[3:42:13.140 --> 3:42:15.700]  They've got thousands of employees.
[3:42:15.700 --> 3:42:18.380]  You'd think they'd want subscriptions to be able to read what's on there.
[3:42:18.380 --> 3:42:20.540]  I guess they already get them 35.
[3:42:20.540 --> 3:42:22.580]  I mean, that is incredible.
[3:42:22.580 --> 3:42:27.340]  And by the way, news day is one of the better mainstream publications.
[3:42:27.340 --> 3:42:32.260]  Uh, I mean, they exposed how the CPS was taking kids in New York and giving them to chemical
[3:42:32.260 --> 3:42:35.060]  firms to test pesticides on them till they killed them.
[3:42:35.060 --> 3:42:36.060]  That was four or five years ago.
[3:42:36.060 --> 3:42:43.060]  I mean, I've actually seen some good reporting on a news day, so I mean, it's, it's, it's
[3:42:43.060 --> 3:42:46.420]  overall not a good thing though, that the newspapers are completely imploding because
[3:42:46.420 --> 3:42:49.660]  the government saying they're going to come in now with government information and government
[3:42:49.660 --> 3:42:54.780]  newspapers and government sites and government bailouts, i.e. taken over the newspapers in
[3:42:54.780 --> 3:43:00.060]  late October, Newsday, the Long Island daily that the Dolan's bought for 650 million, put
[3:43:00.060 --> 3:43:03.260]  its website, newsday.com behind a paywall.
[3:43:03.260 --> 3:43:07.780]  The paper was one of the first non business newspapers to take the plunge by putting
[3:43:07.780 --> 3:43:09.380]  up a paywall.
[3:43:09.380 --> 3:43:12.660]  So in media circles, it has been followed with interest.
[3:43:12.660 --> 3:43:18.220]  Could its fate be a sign of what others, including the New York Times might expect?
[3:43:18.220 --> 3:43:23.260]  New York Times has done okay with subscription, part of their stuff subscription.
[3:43:23.260 --> 3:43:24.260]  That's the way to do it.
[3:43:24.260 --> 3:43:28.820]  And I never, I discovered all this instinctively.
[3:43:28.820 --> 3:43:34.100]  I just thought I want to give everything away for free, but I can't afford it.
[3:43:34.100 --> 3:43:38.620]  So we'll have premium stuff for people that are, I'll pay, but the, but, but I wanted
[3:43:38.620 --> 3:43:39.900]  to just get out to people.
[3:43:39.900 --> 3:43:47.140]  So we were successful because we have the big audience.
[3:43:47.140 --> 3:43:53.300]  So three months later, how many people have signed up to pay $5 a week or $260 a year
[3:43:53.300 --> 3:43:55.020]  to get unfettered access to Newsday?
[3:43:55.020 --> 3:44:00.380]  Well, I mean, I mean, Newsday, these executives know nothing.
[3:44:00.380 --> 3:44:05.300]  People will not pay $260 for your newspaper.
[3:44:05.300 --> 3:44:14.660]  If it was 595 for a year, you would have gotten probably 10,000 members.
[3:44:14.660 --> 3:44:18.460]  If you would have made it simple to do where somebody just got a membership off their cell
[3:44:18.460 --> 3:44:20.700]  phone by texting, and then they get the code back.
[3:44:20.700 --> 3:44:21.700]  We're trying to move to that.
[3:44:21.700 --> 3:44:23.340]  I mean, believe me, I know how to innovate.
[3:44:23.340 --> 3:44:29.260]  I could, if I could just get my basic management going and get the funding, and I mean, the
[3:44:29.260 --> 3:44:32.940]  sky's the limit if plans I had three years ago would have been launched.
[3:44:32.940 --> 3:44:37.260]  I mean, it is, and I'm not complaining, it's, it's just hard to manage things, especially
[3:44:37.260 --> 3:44:38.260]  when you're working all the time.
[3:44:38.260 --> 3:44:41.620]  I'm on Russia today, radio interviews, you know, just endless work.
[3:44:41.620 --> 3:44:47.940]  Got to see my family, but I know what to implement for us to even be, you know, we're kicking
[3:44:47.940 --> 3:44:48.940]  their butt.
[3:44:48.940 --> 3:44:51.860]  But I mean, I could just annihilate them if I would have made myself three, four years
[3:44:51.860 --> 3:44:55.220]  ago, cracked the whip and do what I needed to be done, but I don't like expanding.
[3:44:55.220 --> 3:45:00.460]  I don't like having to hustle for more money to fund myself, but I know that that is what
[3:45:00.460 --> 3:45:02.700]  must be done if we're really going to beat these people.
[3:45:02.700 --> 3:45:09.260]  But Newsday, here's a message, make it $4, $5, no more than $10.
[3:45:09.260 --> 3:45:12.300]  People might subscribe.
[3:45:12.300 --> 3:45:15.140]  I forgot to turn my phone off, guys.
[3:45:15.140 --> 3:45:16.140]  It's in here ding-donging.
[3:45:16.140 --> 3:45:19.780]  Here, let me see who's calling.
[3:45:19.780 --> 3:45:21.980]  I'll answer it on air.
[3:45:21.980 --> 3:45:23.820]  I have no idea who this is.
[3:45:23.820 --> 3:45:27.540]  Here, let's see who it is.
[3:45:27.540 --> 3:45:29.340]  Hello.
[3:45:29.340 --> 3:45:33.060]  Who's this?
[3:45:33.060 --> 3:45:34.060]  Dean Haglin.
[3:45:34.060 --> 3:45:36.020]  I thought I needed to answer the phone.
[3:45:36.020 --> 3:45:39.940]  You know, I'm live on the radio, bro.
[3:45:39.940 --> 3:45:45.780]  Yeah, no, I, I, I added an hour to the show about a year ago.
[3:45:45.780 --> 3:45:46.780]  Sure.
[3:45:46.780 --> 3:45:50.580]  Hey, uh, what's going on, bro?
[3:45:50.580 --> 3:46:01.380]  Have you, absolutely, I'd like to have you in studio if you're coming to town.
[3:46:01.380 --> 3:46:06.140]  What do we have open on Friday, producers?
[3:46:06.140 --> 3:46:08.820]  It's funny, I never answered calls on air.
[3:46:08.820 --> 3:46:13.380]  One time Charlie Sheen called me and I answered it on air, but what time?
[3:46:13.380 --> 3:46:18.580]  Hey, how about you come in for an hour on, uh, on Friday?
[3:46:18.580 --> 3:46:24.460]  Well, listen, let me, let me, let me hand the phone off to Jaren or Matt Ryan or one
[3:46:24.460 --> 3:46:27.420]  of my producers and then we'll give you our new address.
[3:46:27.420 --> 3:46:31.300]  And let me get you in studio, man.
[3:46:31.300 --> 3:46:32.820]  Take care, buddy.
[3:46:32.820 --> 3:46:33.820]  Don't hang up.
[3:46:33.820 --> 3:46:34.820]  Here's Jaren.
[3:46:34.820 --> 3:46:35.820]  Here's Jaren Nyhart.
[3:46:35.820 --> 3:46:36.820]  Thanks.
[3:46:36.820 --> 3:46:40.580]  That's funny.
[3:46:40.580 --> 3:46:45.060]  Dean Haglin star of X files and loan government and a lot of other movies and films.
[3:46:45.060 --> 3:46:49.060]  Remember he came and told us about how the CIA was telling him what to do in their scripts.
[3:46:49.060 --> 3:46:54.620]  They ran six months before 9 11 a piece on, uh, the loan government where the government
[3:46:54.620 --> 3:47:00.180]  hijacks a plane to fly to the world trade center to get martial law and attack Afghanistan.
[3:47:00.180 --> 3:47:05.400]  They use drills to make norad stand down the rest of the military to stand down during
[3:47:05.400 --> 3:47:06.400]  the attack.
[3:47:06.400 --> 3:47:10.340]  Cause the rest of the military obviously doesn't know it's a staged event.
[3:47:10.340 --> 3:47:13.620]  And the good old CIA just wanted the people to hear that.
[3:47:13.620 --> 3:47:15.300]  What is their problem though?
[3:47:15.300 --> 3:47:16.300]  They're psychopaths.
[3:47:16.300 --> 3:47:20.100]  They, they, they, they like to throw this in your face.
[3:47:20.100 --> 3:47:23.540]  Maybe that could be a new thing where I just have the phone here and, uh, we like patch
[3:47:23.540 --> 3:47:27.740]  it into the, into the, uh, microphones, my calls, hold on.
[3:47:27.740 --> 3:47:28.740]  Hey, yeah.
[3:47:28.740 --> 3:47:29.740]  What's up?
[3:47:29.740 --> 3:47:30.740]  You're doing really multitask.
[3:47:30.740 --> 3:47:34.060]  You know, we're already setting up guests on air and already doing research on air.
[3:47:34.060 --> 3:47:36.340]  I mean, you get to see the sausage making here.
[3:47:36.340 --> 3:47:40.820]  You get to see the blood, the guts, the, you know, the whole process here or the candy
[3:47:40.820 --> 3:47:46.220]  making or the wine making, stomping on the grapes, whatever parallel analogy that you
[3:47:46.220 --> 3:47:47.220]  want to use.
[3:47:47.220 --> 3:47:48.220]  Okay.
[3:47:48.220 --> 3:47:49.220]  Let me get into real news blitzing now.
[3:47:49.220 --> 3:47:53.100]  I got stuck on that man.
[3:47:53.100 --> 3:47:54.860]  There is so much here.
[3:47:54.860 --> 3:47:55.860]  So much here.
[3:47:55.860 --> 3:47:57.140]  Where's that key stack?
[3:47:57.140 --> 3:48:00.860]  I had a key stack of, oh, here it is.
[3:48:00.860 --> 3:48:05.340]  Um, you know, this happened a few days ago.
[3:48:05.340 --> 3:48:12.140]  Paul Watson wrote about it yesterday, potential false flag to be blamed on Muslims foiled.
[3:48:12.140 --> 3:48:15.820]  Prison planet.com.
[3:48:15.820 --> 3:48:21.460]  And it says a Navy vet caught with grenade launcher maps of military bases and Arab head
[3:48:21.460 --> 3:48:22.460]  dress.
[3:48:22.460 --> 3:48:24.340]  Hmm.
[3:48:24.340 --> 3:48:26.700]  And then Watson goes through how it's obviously a false flag.
[3:48:26.700 --> 3:48:28.180]  It has every earmark.
[3:48:28.180 --> 3:48:32.900]  I mean, sometimes when you look out on the lake and you see a duck, it's a decoy.
[3:48:32.900 --> 3:48:36.420]  Somebody who was duck hunting left it out in the lake, but generally you see a duck.
[3:48:36.420 --> 3:48:37.420]  It's a duck.
[3:48:37.420 --> 3:48:42.820]  So it, this might one out of a thousand, not be a staged event, but it, it's, we see
[3:48:42.820 --> 3:48:43.820]  it swimming around out there.
[3:48:43.820 --> 3:48:45.220]  It's probably on a decoy.
[3:48:45.220 --> 3:48:54.700]  Um, remember 2005 in Iraq, British special air services get caught dressed up like Muslims
[3:48:54.700 --> 3:48:58.780]  running around shooting at military and police and then they captured them and it came out.
[3:48:58.780 --> 3:49:00.460]  It was a staged terror attack.
[3:49:00.460 --> 3:49:04.020]  And remember Ray McGovern on the show, top CIA analyst when it came out that our government
[3:49:04.020 --> 3:49:08.500]  blew up the golden mosque to get the Shiites and Sunnis killing each other again so they
[3:49:08.500 --> 3:49:13.420]  could then say, oh, look, we put down the uprisings and later declare victory.
[3:49:13.420 --> 3:49:19.660]  Uh, and every other provocateur at action, people end up calling and in and it gets stopped.
[3:49:19.660 --> 3:49:24.420]  A possible false flag terror attack to be blamed on Muslims has been foiled after a
[3:49:24.420 --> 3:49:28.820]  Navy vet was busted with a grenade launcher assault rivals and hundreds of rounds ammunition
[3:49:28.820 --> 3:49:34.980]  as well as Arab headdresses, but he isn't a Muslim and didn't have the beard any of
[3:49:34.980 --> 3:49:35.980]  it.
[3:49:35.980 --> 3:49:39.220]  In New Jersey yesterday, initial media reports speculated that the man was planning a terror
[3:49:39.220 --> 3:49:41.260]  attack on US military base in the area.
[3:49:41.260 --> 3:49:46.780]  Lloyd Woodson, 43, whose last known address was rest in Virginia today faces multiple
[3:49:46.780 --> 3:49:52.380]  offenses, including second degree unlawful mass weapons, uh, unlawful weapons possession
[3:49:52.380 --> 3:49:57.540]  and fourth degree possession of prohibited weapons, Somerset County prosecutor Wayne
[3:49:57.540 --> 3:50:03.300]  Farris said, there's about a 5% chance he's just crazy or that it's a setup, but it looks
[3:50:03.300 --> 3:50:04.300]  bad.
[3:50:04.300 --> 3:50:11.460]  Um, Brock Berg police confronted Woodson at 355 a.m. at the quick check convenience store
[3:50:11.460 --> 3:50:15.500]  on round 28 of receiving a call reporting a suspicious person see local police stopped
[3:50:15.500 --> 3:50:16.500]  it.
[3:50:16.500 --> 3:50:22.040]  Um, Brock and Berg patrolman Steve Crohn's noticed a large bulge beneath the green military
[3:50:22.040 --> 3:50:26.540]  style jacket that Woodson was wearing, which was later determined to be an assault rifle
[3:50:26.540 --> 3:50:29.300]  with a, the defaced serial number.
[3:50:29.300 --> 3:50:33.740]  That's how they went after him, uh, Farris said after search, specifically had probable
[3:50:33.740 --> 3:50:37.980]  cause after searching his hotel room, police found a grenade launcher, hundreds of rounds
[3:50:37.980 --> 3:50:43.100]  of 50 caliber 308, a police scanner as well as Middle Eastern red and white traditional
[3:50:43.100 --> 3:50:45.300]  headdress.
[3:50:45.300 --> 3:50:48.540]  The man may have had plans to attack a US military base and it goes on from there.
[3:50:48.540 --> 3:50:53.380]  All right, we're going to come back in the final segment with more news blitz.
[3:50:53.380 --> 3:50:54.380]  Stay with us.
[3:50:54.380 --> 3:50:57.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay of the course, final segments straight ahead, then I break
[3:50:57.620 --> 3:50:59.420]  down in great detail.
[3:50:59.420 --> 3:51:01.660]  The Geithner situation gets key.
[3:51:01.660 --> 3:51:06.980]  Hi neighbor, they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[3:51:06.980 --> 3:51:10.260]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was
[3:51:10.260 --> 3:51:12.060]  none left at any price.
[3:51:12.060 --> 3:51:15.780]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those
[3:51:15.780 --> 3:51:17.780]  unable to care for themselves.
[3:51:17.780 --> 3:51:21.980]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish
[3:51:21.980 --> 3:51:25.380]  who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[3:51:25.380 --> 3:51:31.100]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[3:51:31.100 --> 3:51:35.460]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that on heavenly place, the good intentions
[3:51:35.460 --> 3:51:38.820]  alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[3:51:38.820 --> 3:51:43.900]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[3:51:43.900 --> 3:52:03.260]  Call 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com, who am I, some of who cares.
[3:52:03.260 --> 3:52:06.980]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:52:06.980 --> 3:52:10.140]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:52:10.140 --> 3:52:14.460]  These are finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:52:14.460 --> 3:52:15.460]  at home.
[3:52:15.460 --> 3:52:20.620]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[3:52:20.620 --> 3:52:21.620]  shots.
[3:52:21.620 --> 3:52:26.540]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.540 --> 3:52:32.220]  For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[3:52:32.220 --> 3:52:36.620]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:36.620 --> 3:52:39.020]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:52:39.020 --> 3:52:43.180]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:52:43.180 --> 3:52:49.020]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[3:52:49.020 --> 3:52:50.340]  of the republic.

[3:53:55.100 --> 3:54:07.620]  I really appreciate Darwin Medeker.
[3:54:07.620 --> 3:54:13.940]  I really pushed his arm to come to the protest on money to get him up here from San Antonio
[3:54:13.940 --> 3:54:18.340]  and he wanted me on air right now to thank all my listeners that came out to that event
[3:54:18.340 --> 3:54:22.980]  and made it such a success.
[3:54:22.980 --> 3:54:25.420]  He gave me some good news.
[3:54:25.420 --> 3:54:32.700]  He is in the Target Center, which isn't as big but is almost as big, the 20th and 21st
[3:54:32.700 --> 3:54:39.140]  at Exit 228 and William Cannon I-35 on the 20th and 21st of next month.
[3:54:39.140 --> 3:54:43.100]  Now I'm going to be there and I hope you're going to be there because the feds are going
[3:54:43.100 --> 3:54:44.100]  to be trying stuff.
[3:54:44.100 --> 3:54:48.260]  We're going to have to try to run a counter sting on them with their setups and expose
[3:54:48.260 --> 3:54:50.780]  their criminal activity.
[3:54:50.780 --> 3:54:51.780]  They're not done.
[3:54:51.780 --> 3:54:55.460]  They've got to run us out of there and as the governor said, that will show a clear
[3:54:55.460 --> 3:55:00.620]  pattern of criminal activity of intimidation and racketeering but they're not going to
[3:55:00.620 --> 3:55:01.620]  stop.
[3:55:01.620 --> 3:55:02.620]  They think this is their town.
[3:55:02.620 --> 3:55:04.420]  They think the people of Austin belong to them.
[3:55:04.420 --> 3:55:08.020]  That is the city council, the ATF and the police leadership.
[3:55:08.020 --> 3:55:10.220]  The average cop out there is disgusted by this.
[3:55:10.220 --> 3:55:14.900]  The reason I know is my dad came to the protest and I didn't notice him because the whole
[3:55:14.900 --> 3:55:19.300]  time I was there I had like Cohen Telpro poking me and getting in my face and I'm sure some
[3:55:19.300 --> 3:55:22.620]  of them were because later I found out about a meeting afterwards which some people we
[3:55:22.620 --> 3:55:26.740]  know are connected to some operations about how they want to get me and go after me and
[3:55:26.740 --> 3:55:32.380]  it's a whole other subject but it borders on illegal but luckily we had people inside
[3:55:32.380 --> 3:55:35.900]  who found out about that and called me about it but separate issue.
[3:55:35.900 --> 3:55:40.100]  Any time you come out of the Second Amendment you're going to have disruptors who are going
[3:55:40.100 --> 3:55:44.580]  to try to spend things and do that but they failed miserably but my dad was there.
[3:55:44.580 --> 3:55:46.300]  I didn't know that.
[3:55:46.300 --> 3:55:51.980]  I didn't understand that and he said he was walking up and he was in a sports jacket
[3:55:51.980 --> 3:55:54.100]  and stuff and so he was clean cut.
[3:55:54.100 --> 3:55:58.580]  The cops talked to him and he looks distinguished and he went up to their cars, people to parking
[3:55:58.580 --> 3:56:04.300]  garage and he was given in the law that there's no law against private sale of firearms.
[3:56:04.300 --> 3:56:07.980]  The police said we know, we know it's bull and one of them held up his blackberry that
[3:56:07.980 --> 3:56:12.780]  actually had the law and he goes yes we all know it's a load of bologna and so every copy
[3:56:12.780 --> 3:56:18.220]  we talked to was my dad was nice and came over was yes we know it's bologna, yes we
[3:56:18.220 --> 3:56:20.660]  know, yes we know, we know.
[3:56:20.660 --> 3:56:22.500]  Well what are you doing?
[3:56:22.500 --> 3:56:27.980]  The police union should be saying they don't want to be part of this but I remember we
[3:56:27.980 --> 3:56:32.820]  used to go out and bullhorn the million mom march, it would be more like the 20 bureaucrat
[3:56:32.820 --> 3:56:36.820]  march and they would have people there trying to stir stuff up and get in my face.
[3:56:36.820 --> 3:56:38.540]  It doesn't stop me.
[3:56:38.540 --> 3:56:47.060]  Everything stops me, short of a bullet, that's God's will whether or not that happens but
[3:56:47.060 --> 3:56:53.020]  it's just absolutely amazing to see the people of America rising up and standing up and the
[3:56:53.020 --> 3:56:56.500]  police were there to intimidate people in the windows taking photos of people for their
[3:56:56.500 --> 3:57:01.860]  intelligence files and some of my crew saw it and reportedly we've got the video, we
[3:57:01.860 --> 3:57:07.740]  just had to dump it, dump it to computer to watch it of snipers on the roof but it wasn't
[3:57:07.740 --> 3:57:13.060]  as bad as Waco when I went up there and protested the Ku Klux Klan, they had provocateurs there
[3:57:13.060 --> 3:57:20.540]  as well and there were hundreds of people protesting the Klan, probably 300, 400 and
[3:57:20.540 --> 3:57:25.300]  I turned around and the police were in the parking garage and I was wearing a t-shirt
[3:57:25.300 --> 3:57:30.740]  obviously no weapon, they had me trained in their sights and when you look at a gun you
[3:57:30.740 --> 3:57:34.700]  see it's aimed right at you, I mean the guy was 100 yards away up in the parking garage
[3:57:34.700 --> 3:57:43.580]  across the street, trained on me, trained on me and then Mike Hansen, he was with me
[3:57:43.580 --> 3:57:57.380]  and it was just a horrible thing to witness that going on, okay continuing here with some
[3:57:57.380 --> 3:58:02.820]  of the other news here to close out this radio broadcast, I've got so much I'm trying to
[3:58:02.820 --> 3:58:07.540]  pick the most important here at the end of running out of time, I meant to play this
[3:58:07.540 --> 3:58:13.500]  video but it's up on InfoWars.com and PrismPlanet.com, congressmen admits we're told not to call
[3:58:13.500 --> 3:58:17.780]  another stimulus bill, calling it a jobs bill, it's another banker bailout, they're going
[3:58:17.780 --> 3:58:26.540]  to call it a jobs bill and we have the congressmen up there talking about how they've been told
[3:58:26.540 --> 3:58:32.980]  that, live with people again for another hoax, I cover the implosion of the Federal Reserve
[3:58:32.980 --> 3:58:36.460]  and the criminal bankers and how this could bring them down if we get the word out coming
[3:58:36.460 --> 3:58:41.460]  up in the next hour of retransmission, InfoWars.com don't forget the podcast, great job crew.
[3:58:41.460 --> 3:58:50.460]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade, we are the GCN
[3:58:50.460 --> 3:58:52.900]  Radio Network.
[3:58:52.900 --> 3:58:58.540]  of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[3:58:58.540 --> 3:58:59.540]  relive history.
[3:58:59.540 --> 3:59:04.140]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:59:04.140 --> 3:59:05.140]  at home.
[3:59:05.140 --> 3:59:09.800]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are
[3:59:09.800 --> 3:59:10.800]  calling the shots.
[3:59:10.800 --> 3:59:16.140]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:59:16.140 --> 3:59:22.180]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell-bent
[3:59:22.180 --> 3:59:26.300]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:59:26.300 --> 3:59:30.660]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[3:59:30.660 --> 3:59:32.660]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:59:32.660 --> 3:59:38.660]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
