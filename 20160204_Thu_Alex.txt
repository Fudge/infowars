[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.800]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:28.080]  the first place obama visited internationally once he was officially
[00:28.080 --> 00:34.320]  president was Cairo where he gave a speech basically raising more radical
[00:34.320 --> 00:38.880]  tenets of Islam and enthralling much of the muslim world because he spoke
[00:38.880 --> 00:43.920]  better than top imams and it's taking me a while to figure out exactly what's
[00:43.920 --> 00:48.160]  going on here and it's full scope but we now have a deep analysis of it we're
[00:48.160 --> 00:50.880]  gonna go over that today what does it mean that he wants to this mosque in
[00:50.880 --> 00:56.080]  Baltimore and then spoke out against basically extremism and he's always
[00:56.080 --> 01:00.960]  constantly criticizing christians and quote christian extremism on days like
[01:00.960 --> 01:06.480]  Easter and more what is the whole point here we're gonna break that down
[01:06.480 --> 01:10.320]  coming up and also joe bigs is coming in right after the first break
[01:10.320 --> 01:14.160]  associated press the police are now reporting they have the witnesses it's
[01:14.160 --> 01:19.760]  confirmed that the attackers that came in and struck a course and and shot up the
[01:19.760 --> 01:24.080]  nightclub were embedded with quote immigrants we always
[01:24.080 --> 01:26.880]  knew that but the media lied about it now they're claiming there's a whole bunch
[01:26.880 --> 01:29.440]  of them embedded but first here's a key report
[01:29.440 --> 01:35.920]  with jacari jackson on college keel and their worship of the burn
[01:35.920 --> 01:39.600]  last night we saw the results of the iowa caucus where ted Cruz donald
[01:39.600 --> 01:43.280]  trump and marco rubio came in first second and third respectively
[01:43.280 --> 01:46.480]  on the democratic side we saw mrs clinton have a very narrow
[01:46.480 --> 01:50.160]  and many people say debated victory over bernie sanders so we're here at the
[01:50.160 --> 01:53.520]  university of texas we're gonna find out which of the candidates are best for
[01:53.520 --> 01:55.280]  the people here
[01:55.280 --> 01:57.840]  hey are you doing sir we're asking people who their favorite presidential
[01:57.840 --> 02:02.240]  candidate is uh bernie sanders right now yes probably
[02:02.240 --> 02:06.880]  with uh hillary clinton or rubio someone rubio any particular reasons why
[02:06.880 --> 02:10.800]  i want someone more towards the center bernie sanders for sure probably
[02:10.800 --> 02:14.320]  okay so you're feeling the burn uh any particular reason probably as a student
[02:14.320 --> 02:18.240]  all of this policy is about um tuition free college i don't know if it'll be
[02:18.240 --> 02:21.600]  possible but it works for me who would pay for the
[02:21.600 --> 02:25.680]  free tuition hopefully the rich people of america
[02:25.680 --> 02:28.640]  how's he going to pay for all the free stuff that he's
[02:28.640 --> 02:33.040]  suggesting he's going to give i think you know he's going to try like you know
[02:33.040 --> 02:37.040]  obviously you know uh use tax money to pay for it
[02:37.040 --> 02:42.960]  not donald trump why not the donald i just think he's like
[02:42.960 --> 02:47.920]  not um as involved in politics as he should be in order to be our president
[02:47.920 --> 02:54.560]  i feel like he's too business minded uh bernie sanders any particular reason
[02:54.560 --> 02:59.840]  uh no i don't really follow politics really i just uh
[02:59.840 --> 03:03.600]  he's really dumb just don't like donald trump or
[03:03.600 --> 03:08.640]  uh free stuff free hey don mess we're asking people who their favorite
[03:08.640 --> 03:11.760]  presidential candidate is right hillary yeah
[03:11.760 --> 03:15.520]  right particular reasons uh she's a female and
[03:15.520 --> 03:19.440]  everyone else i just i don't know she's a female that i'm
[03:19.440 --> 03:23.600]  fork i feel out of all the ones that are candidates right now like she would
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.320]  girl power but not exactly is there any particular policy that you like about
[03:28.320 --> 03:32.240]  her um
[03:32.240 --> 03:37.600]  no i guess just that she's a democrat i guess that'd be the only democrat why
[03:37.600 --> 03:42.240]  not bernie if she's a democrat no she's female so ask her do you know how to
[03:42.240 --> 03:45.760]  like her but that's why anything in particular with bernie
[03:45.760 --> 03:50.080]  well i mean this uh this clear issue of the the
[03:50.080 --> 03:54.720]  one percent and the the freedom to become richer and not necessarily having
[03:54.720 --> 03:57.520]  a better distribution of wealth in the country i think that's a very
[03:57.520 --> 04:00.320]  beautiful communo i don't want to put words in your
[04:00.320 --> 04:03.120]  mouth but my understanding what you're saying here is that you are supporting
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.520]  uh bernie sanders and his wealth redistribution no well yes i am yeah
[04:07.520 --> 04:11.200]  why do you like bernie he just seems like a good guy you know he's a
[04:11.200 --> 04:14.960]  socialist i believe and uh i believe in what he stands for
[04:14.960 --> 04:17.920]  we had a referendum last year don't know if you're aware of it
[04:17.920 --> 04:21.920]  where um scotland's are the opportunity to break free from the united kingdom
[04:21.920 --> 04:25.120]  yeah um and i was very much in favor of that because
[04:25.120 --> 04:27.920]  we wanted the social socialist government let me let me ask you this
[04:27.920 --> 04:30.240]  let's say 20 years from now you you have that
[04:30.240 --> 04:33.840]  ut education you have your big career and whatever and you're doing good
[04:33.840 --> 04:36.960]  it would you be okay paying for somebody else's tuition at that point
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.720]  absolutely i think it's for the responsibility of the other class of america
[04:40.720 --> 04:43.680]  to take care of the lower class well there you have the majority of the people
[04:43.680 --> 04:46.880]  we've talked to in the short time we've been here at the university of texas
[04:46.880 --> 04:50.960]  support the democrat socialist bernie sanders you can find more reports on
[04:50.960 --> 04:54.000]  info wars dot com by the way that that report is so
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.040]  scary i'm gonna play that again with begs's report
[04:57.040 --> 05:00.800]  because these people are idiots joe begs here with info wars dot com
[05:00.800 --> 05:03.920]  obama hit jesus at catholic university but allows
[05:03.920 --> 05:07.600]  a lot to be widely displayed during islamic center speech so it should be
[05:07.600 --> 05:10.960]  pretty obvious now to everyone at this point in time that president obama
[05:10.960 --> 05:14.480]  does indeed have a double standard when it comes to religions especially
[05:14.480 --> 05:17.840]  if it rhymes with christian this article is up at info wars dot com
[05:17.840 --> 05:21.760]  from declaring that the united states is no longer a christian nation
[05:21.760 --> 05:25.520]  to denying syrian christians entry into the country president obama's
[05:25.520 --> 05:29.600]  distaste for the followers of jesus are as obvious as it knows on your face
[05:29.600 --> 05:33.120]  but with less than a year left in his presidency obama hasn't given up on
[05:33.120 --> 05:37.840]  disincrisions at every opportunity for example president obama gave a speech
[05:37.840 --> 05:40.800]  at a mosque in the islamic society of baltimore on
[05:40.800 --> 05:44.560]  wednesday while standing in front of a glass wall where the word a lot was
[05:44.560 --> 05:49.200]  written 99 times in arabic calligraphy the president took a stab at a republican
[05:49.200 --> 05:52.240]  presidential hopeful donald trump by stating there was an

[08:26.000 --> 08:31.920]  joe bigs my friends is standing by right now to break down the latest that's
[08:31.920 --> 08:36.800]  in the associated press paris attacks leader said he entered
[08:36.800 --> 08:41.840]  france in group of 90 now we're going to get back to this at a
[08:41.840 --> 08:45.760]  moment and it ties into a new report german police arrest three
[08:45.760 --> 08:49.600]  islamicist terrorist during raids at buildings including asylum
[08:49.600 --> 08:54.560]  seeker centers after tip-off of planned severe acts of terrorism
[08:54.560 --> 08:58.480]  they already covered up of course the plan to blow up a soccer stadium football
[08:58.480 --> 09:04.720]  stadium this is new breaking today and and why is this important
[09:04.720 --> 09:09.440]  we know at least six of the original nine that they were able to get and kill
[09:09.440 --> 09:13.360]  were asylum seekers that came in through Greece and Italy
[09:13.360 --> 09:17.200]  that was in the news days after confirmed their names photos taken
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.120]  by the italians and by the greek police before they were sent on into europe
[09:21.120 --> 09:24.160]  we're into a whole report detailing this on the news tonight we're gonna go over
[09:24.160 --> 09:27.680]  right now as well got a big show lined up but we're
[09:27.680 --> 09:31.040]  going to start with this right now then we learned that there were dozens and
[09:31.040 --> 09:36.240]  dozens others all over france in belgium i sent joe bigs and the
[09:36.240 --> 09:39.280]  crew over there they would go to areas of belgium in
[09:39.280 --> 09:43.280]  paris where they would go five six miles in any
[09:43.280 --> 09:46.080]  direction and no one would let them in the convenience store
[09:46.080 --> 09:49.760]  in a restaurant on the street then would run out and say get out of here
[09:49.760 --> 09:53.680]  you know infidels screaming joe bigs said it was crazier than being in
[09:53.680 --> 09:56.720]  afghanistan and iraq i mean it was get out of here
[09:56.720 --> 10:00.880]  but of course they tell you that there are no no go zones in
[10:00.880 --> 10:04.480]  europe but we have endless footage we just played some yesterday of people being
[10:04.480 --> 10:08.640]  beaten up in england for for for for being english and driving through the
[10:08.640 --> 10:13.840]  city what are you doing here you brit ah you hit you i mean this is this is
[10:13.840 --> 10:18.240]  what's going on and then we have the democrats and the socialists
[10:18.240 --> 10:21.920]  in europe and here in the u.s just saying bring in unlimited they're not
[10:21.920 --> 10:25.360]  bringing them in from jordan they're not bringing them in
[10:25.360 --> 10:30.240]  uh from other countries that are middle eastern that are more pro-western
[10:30.240 --> 10:35.200]  they're bringing them in from the most radical areas and they're wahhabist
[10:35.200 --> 10:41.280]  and you can type in king of jordan says the public is ready to revolt over
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.200]  asylum seekers they've only taken five thousand
[10:45.200 --> 10:49.360]  and jordan which is muslim predominantly is ready to revolt through the type of
[10:49.360 --> 10:53.120]  muslims that let their daughters actually go to school and
[10:53.120 --> 10:56.880]  let them out of the house you know now you let your cat out you know to go out
[10:56.880 --> 10:59.280]  at night or whatever well i mean they let their daughters out
[10:59.280 --> 11:03.040]  they treat them a lot better that's why of course the feminists and liberals
[11:03.040 --> 11:05.040]  hate them and say they're not taking enough in
[11:05.040 --> 11:09.200]  Saudi Arabia that keeps women as actual slaves hasn't taken one asylum seeker
[11:09.200 --> 11:14.960]  so that's some of the background news on all this setting the table
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.840]  for obama hid jesus at catholic university they actually
[11:19.840 --> 11:23.840]  hid it for his speech hung a drape over it
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.080]  but allows a la to be widely displayed during islamic center speech
[11:28.080 --> 11:31.120]  right behind him in fact they added it for the speech
[11:31.120 --> 11:34.800]  and remember when the iranian ayatollah visited
[11:34.800 --> 11:40.720]  two weeks ago to italy all over the the path he drove and the buildings he
[11:40.720 --> 11:46.160]  visited they covered roman statues breast and genitals
[11:46.160 --> 11:50.800]  so the message under political correctness is bend over completely
[11:50.800 --> 11:57.360]  backwards for anything islamic listen i'm the guy that was against the iraq war
[11:57.360 --> 12:01.760]  i was against it all from day one i don't want to have a clash of civilizations
[12:01.760 --> 12:05.200]  but the clash is now here and we know the angle of it
[12:05.200 --> 12:08.400]  bring it in and make the west give up its free speech
[12:08.400 --> 12:11.760]  to pacify the muslims i'm not doing it ever
[12:11.760 --> 12:15.200]  and people are like whoa he is like the last few years on
[12:15.200 --> 12:20.720]  fire against islam islam you can debate where it came from what it stands for
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.800]  what it does it's been taken over by radicals
[12:24.800 --> 12:28.800]  even lewis fair con agreed with me on that a month ago in an interview
[12:28.800 --> 12:32.960]  he said it's a failed religion
[12:34.240 --> 12:37.600]  boy when the radical muslims don't have lewis fair con anymore
[12:37.600 --> 12:40.960]  they're not doing too good are they i mean that's how crazy this is ladies and
[12:40.960 --> 12:43.840]  gentlemen and there have been some good periods in islam
[12:43.840 --> 12:47.280]  where it was actually a force of good i mean i've had historians on about that
[12:47.280 --> 12:51.360]  about a 200 year period but it did invade europe before the crusades were
[12:51.360 --> 12:56.080]  response to that and i'm sick of hearing that the west
[12:56.080 --> 13:01.920]  must capitulate to islam and then islam combines forces with radical
[13:01.920 --> 13:07.360]  socialist communists and others who are promoting it to be their foot soldiers
[13:07.360 --> 13:13.280]  in the takeover so to detail this remember all the news reports all the
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.280]  newscasts going these were peresians these were french that did this there
[13:17.280 --> 13:22.480]  wasn't one person at the nightclub attack that killed all those people
[13:22.480 --> 13:27.360]  last year there was that one person that wasn't french
[13:27.360 --> 13:29.840]  that way they could say they weren't even muslims kind of like san bernadino
[13:29.840 --> 13:34.080]  was workplace violence yeah so was pearl harbor
[13:34.080 --> 13:37.760]  so was 9-11 i guess and of course it turned out it was a jihad plan
[13:37.760 --> 13:42.000]  train in saudi arabia and pakistan so not one peris attacker there it is has
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.560]  been identified as a Syrian refugee see that's the headline they ran that
[13:46.560 --> 13:50.160]  sucker i've got it on screen everywhere and we were like day one going wait a
[13:50.160 --> 13:54.400]  minute the italian government
[13:54.400 --> 13:57.760]  the greek government
[13:58.160 --> 14:01.680]  there it is one independent peris attacks eight terrorist suspects named
[14:01.680 --> 14:05.120]  not the folks that were killed but just who they named so far not
[14:05.120 --> 14:09.600]  refugees so far are not refugees have no e u
[14:09.600 --> 14:14.800]  passports what and that was a deliberate d
[14:14.800 --> 14:20.240]  demonization campaign of anybody reporting the facts it was a deliberate
[14:20.240 --> 14:25.280]  disinformation campaign to steer people away it was known day one so i sent joe
[14:25.280 --> 14:29.920]  biggs and peru over there to witness what was
[14:29.920 --> 14:33.840]  really going on in paris but also across the border in brussels belgium
[14:33.840 --> 14:39.920]  and it was a three-ring circus and we knew immediately that they were
[14:39.920 --> 14:43.120]  infiltrating an asylum seekers now how do we know that
[14:43.120 --> 14:46.640]  because we're crack reporters or because i even sent folks over to
[14:46.640 --> 14:51.200]  france no nine months before the attacks last
[14:51.200 --> 14:54.720]  december remember there were a bunch of tax in europe not just the one in paris
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.720]  there were more than 15 attacks total in france alone that month
[14:58.720 --> 15:02.160]  they got swept under the rug bombings burning shootings
[15:02.160 --> 15:06.320]  only the big event got attention remember what happened
[15:06.320 --> 15:09.280]  it was in the associated press it was in roiders it was all over the news at the
[15:09.280 --> 15:14.960]  time isis pledges to send 500 000 refugees
[15:14.960 --> 15:22.160]  to europe as part of invasion plan and promised to implant terrorist within
[15:22.160 --> 15:24.640]  it you can pull those headlines up just type in
[15:24.640 --> 15:28.720]  isis promised 500 000 migrant wave and i guess they
[15:28.720 --> 15:32.320]  quadrupled down because millions came in
[15:32.320 --> 15:36.000]  more than two million last year not 500 000
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.240]  there it is daily mail isis threatens to send 500 000 migrants to europe
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.120]  as a psychological weapon in chilling echo of qaddafi's prophecy
[15:45.120 --> 15:49.040]  that the mediterranean will become a sea of chaos and that was from february
[15:49.040 --> 15:54.640]  2015 as i just said nine months before the
[15:54.640 --> 15:57.840]  attacks now my memory served correctly right there
[15:57.840 --> 16:01.120]  and it does about 95 percent of the time that's why i just say stuff and they
[16:01.120 --> 16:03.680]  check it as i've gotten older and more stressed
[16:03.680 --> 16:06.720]  used to be almost a hundred percent accurate it's it's failing some so you
[16:06.720 --> 16:09.600]  gotta double check what i say but they just did it and i was exactly right
[16:09.600 --> 16:12.960]  there okay i messed up some gun
[16:12.960 --> 16:16.320]  statistics the other day but i was still overall generally right
[16:16.320 --> 16:19.520]  and i'm gonna go back over that soon with a clarification
[16:19.520 --> 16:22.480]  but the point is gun crimes have been going way down
[16:22.480 --> 16:25.600]  and most of it's suicide and it's a huge red herring that guns are the big
[16:25.600 --> 16:29.680]  threat in this country but i digress joe bigs is here for this segment and the
[16:29.680 --> 16:34.800]  next then big trump insider shadow pretty much campaign head advisors joining
[16:34.800 --> 16:39.200]  us roger stone a flotilla of other guests a democratic
[16:39.200 --> 16:42.560]  senator that has switched over to be a republicans joining us
[16:42.560 --> 16:47.920]  just a lot more coming up today but joe bigs the frustration to have ices say
[16:47.920 --> 16:51.680]  we're infiltrating in the migrants to have their imams say we're going to rape
[16:51.680 --> 16:56.000]  your women and take over with a sexual jihad all over the news
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.360]  to have them say what they're going to do watch it happen go over there
[16:59.360 --> 17:03.680]  prove it and still have media go there were no muslims in the paris attacks
[17:03.680 --> 17:06.960]  there were no muslims in san bernadino it's workplace violence
[17:06.960 --> 17:10.800]  i mean i pretty much heard that from the austin police chief who's a nice guy
[17:10.800 --> 17:15.120]  yesterday again i mean it's political correctness they feel like if they
[17:15.120 --> 17:18.320]  don't say this he's racist i have to know artesaveta is pretty
[17:18.320 --> 17:21.600]  conservative you know behind closed doors but
[17:21.600 --> 17:25.600]  you know even he goes along with this it gets crazier and crazier
[17:25.600 --> 17:29.120]  and now we'll get into this new report from the associated press
[17:29.120 --> 17:33.040]  and the french police with the truth is coming out big time joe bigs
[17:33.040 --> 17:36.000]  well exactly the woman who tipped police of the islamic state commander the
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  november 13th attacks in paris says that he entered the paris region
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.760]  with a multinational group of people over 90
[17:43.760 --> 17:47.040]  so that's a 90 people that came in there was only a few attackers who were
[17:47.040 --> 17:50.640]  involved with that actual attack at the botaclon theater and other places
[17:50.640 --> 17:53.680]  right down the road from the charlie hebdo attacks
[17:53.680 --> 17:56.880]  just months later and then you know like you said we even have a president that
[17:56.880 --> 18:00.720]  is coming out and covering up jesus and christian things
[18:00.720 --> 18:03.840]  like that but then he'll stay in there and give a speech at a mosque
[18:03.840 --> 18:06.720]  with a law written in the background all over the place
[18:06.720 --> 18:10.000]  that shows you right there that there is a cover-up going on that they're
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.880]  allowing this to happen you know we went over there and we
[18:12.880 --> 18:16.720]  spoke to washington insiders different people who said that the reason those
[18:16.720 --> 18:20.480]  attacks happened was simply because of the open border
[18:20.480 --> 18:23.920]  situation and that the isis militants were going to use
[18:23.920 --> 18:27.440]  that refugee crisis as a way to exploit that open border
[18:27.440 --> 18:31.680]  use fake passports come in and carry out attacks and yet we're told every day to
[18:31.680 --> 18:34.960]  be uh loving and accepting of this entire thing
[18:34.960 --> 18:38.400]  i mean it's completely and totally ridiculous
[18:38.400 --> 18:42.720]  it's a total example of syop that we're being overrun we're being attacked
[18:42.720 --> 18:46.320]  they're attacking women it's it's it's total
[18:46.320 --> 18:51.520]  stone age totalitarianism and then we're told we're bad if we don't accept it
[18:51.520 --> 18:54.960]  and and then change our free speech and our rights
[18:54.960 --> 18:59.200]  for this radical version of islam that's taking over islam itself
[18:59.200 --> 19:02.480]  and what i don't understand there's a guy who actually promotes
[19:02.480 --> 19:05.600]  rape he's actually going to be in texas here in the next few days
[19:05.600 --> 19:09.600]  holding a a meetup group where he can talk about pro rape agendas
[19:09.600 --> 19:12.000]  and things like that and i want you to go confront him i know you're already
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.600]  playing and that's bad and the people are mad about that but it's okay if we
[19:15.600 --> 19:18.720]  allow these migrants to come over who we've seen the video footage over in
[19:18.720 --> 19:22.400]  europe where they are raping women down in subways well they're now saying it's
[19:22.400 --> 19:24.640]  their culture to grab your nine-year-old daughter
[19:24.640 --> 19:27.440]  off the street they actually say this so the police are saying just keep your
[19:27.440 --> 19:31.360]  nine-year-olds in well they're they're teaching women to use the force
[19:31.360 --> 19:35.280]  to to to push these by the way since i mentioned that it sounds so insane when
[19:35.280 --> 19:38.480]  you guys repulled paul's article from yesterday and had that video ready
[19:38.480 --> 19:42.160]  it links to mainstream news in europe saying don't just vomit or urinate on
[19:42.160 --> 19:45.280]  a man trying to rape you like they teach in the u.s instead of just pulling out

[21:23.280 --> 21:27.280]  now he's made predictions like this before and he was right then too

[21:30.480 --> 21:34.560]  they did before that he warned that dot-com companies would crash
[21:34.560 --> 21:37.760]  they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves

[24:16.320 --> 24:20.480]  branch in german and other governments admit to it's probably twice that
[24:20.480 --> 24:23.680]  generally is have been brought in just last year alone there's about half that
[24:23.680 --> 24:27.280]  number of the year before and similar to the year before so we're talking
[24:27.280 --> 24:33.680]  six seven eight million they claim that 30 something then 40 something
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.120]  then 50 something total syrian refugees have been
[24:37.120 --> 24:41.040]  brought into texas but they won't tell the governor where or when in the last
[24:41.040 --> 24:46.320]  year all i know is there's 321 listed on the
[24:46.320 --> 24:50.640]  anderson high school website my alma mater in north austin and jacari jackson
[24:50.640 --> 24:54.640]  went over there a month and a half ago reportedly now there's hundreds more
[24:54.640 --> 24:57.840]  there but that hasn't been put on their website yet
[24:57.840 --> 25:03.600]  but they give demographics on the aisd website we went and checked the average
[25:03.600 --> 25:08.160]  high school has over 200 from syria libya or other areas of
[25:08.160 --> 25:12.160]  north africa right now and these aren't the people
[25:12.160 --> 25:16.640]  that the al-qaeda folks invaded these are the al-qaeda folks now
[25:16.640 --> 25:20.480]  after they've done looting a lot of them are now coming here some are legitimate
[25:20.480 --> 25:25.120]  refugees but a lot of them aren't that's what ices promised to do
[25:25.120 --> 25:30.400]  in videos and press releases in february of 2015
[25:30.400 --> 25:35.520]  now by november and december we saw attacks all over europe
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.560]  but they've also been directed to rape the infidels and it translates out
[25:40.560 --> 25:43.920]  to a nasty word that they use in south africa
[25:43.920 --> 25:46.400]  today against black people for some reason it's the same word i'm not going to
[25:46.400 --> 25:51.600]  use it it's like the n word um and the point is but it begins with a k
[25:51.600 --> 25:57.520]  or you also use a c the point is is that uh the killing of blacks the raping of
[25:57.520 --> 26:02.960]  women because according to the wabi is blacks uh are our cursed slaves
[26:02.960 --> 26:06.960]  well the passages call them really racist names
[26:06.960 --> 26:10.000]  raising head things like that it's it's very evil stuff
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.160]  and you have to understand folks they're not just sexist they're very very racist
[26:14.160 --> 26:18.880]  and it's out of control and joe bigs was on iraq several tours afghanistan
[26:18.880 --> 26:22.240]  several tours went up against this and he was telling me what he saw in europe
[26:22.240 --> 26:25.840]  was scarier than what he saw over there on average the concentration of the
[26:25.840 --> 26:28.720]  loons because there are a lot of folks in these arab countries and muslim
[26:28.720 --> 26:32.400]  countries that don't like what's going on and like america like the west but
[26:32.400 --> 26:35.760]  it seems like you've got to be an anti-western scumbag
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.120]  to be let in so joe bigs getting into the article itself
[26:39.120 --> 26:44.640]  ap the ringleader and now 90 people entering france
[26:44.640 --> 26:49.120]  that they haven't caught yet uh admitting that they came in as refugees
[26:49.120 --> 26:53.520]  we've always known this but why would it suddenly be in the ap joe
[26:53.520 --> 26:57.200]  well so what happened is is uh the attacker entered the paris region
[26:57.200 --> 27:00.480]  among a multinational group of 90 extremists that still scattered in the
[27:00.480 --> 27:04.080]  area now in an interview aired thursday by rmc television
[27:04.080 --> 27:08.880]  a conf uh and confirmed by her lawyer the woman identified only a sawnia said
[27:08.880 --> 27:13.760]  abdulhamid abode was proud of the attack that killed over 130 people
[27:13.760 --> 27:16.800]  uh in paris you know there was a lot that happened at the botaclon theater they
[27:16.800 --> 27:20.400]  stormed in shooting people there was an american band eagles of death metal that
[27:20.400 --> 27:23.280]  was but these were white privilege folks they deserved it right oh yeah of course
[27:23.280 --> 27:27.600]  apparently a sawnia was with abu's a female cousin when they picked him up
[27:27.600 --> 27:31.200]  from a deserted stretch of road outside of paris to be taken
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.600]  to the hideout in saint denny where his uh where he ultimately died
[27:35.600 --> 27:39.040]  now michael zimmerman and myself were actually there we caught footage
[27:39.040 --> 27:43.120]  actually got pictures of the bodies all that so the police went in raided that
[27:43.120 --> 27:46.160]  whole area blocked it off and we were able to sneak around and kind of see
[27:46.160 --> 27:48.800]  what happened right you got the only footage of that but you know like they
[27:48.800 --> 27:52.640]  said there was only a few people involved in that attack there's still
[27:52.640 --> 27:58.080]  tons more that are in that area waiting now she said he told her he had entered
[27:58.080 --> 28:02.560]  france without documents among a group of the 90 that included both europeans
[28:02.560 --> 28:07.280]  and arabs so there you know that it's not just europeans it's not just french
[28:07.280 --> 28:10.320]  there are arabs coming from outside of that area into that area and they were
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.480]  using that refugee crisis they were using fake passports we've seen those reports
[28:14.480 --> 28:19.280]  as well and we've known this since day one i mean i just said this was their
[28:19.280 --> 28:22.880]  plan they've done it but they played on the numbers it's like
[28:22.880 --> 28:25.840]  these air force bases i have mainstream articles going
[28:25.840 --> 28:29.280]  it appears thousands are being brought into the air base outside san francisco
[28:29.280 --> 28:32.240]  but we will not be given the details we've been asking for months and there's
[28:32.240 --> 28:37.440]  just hundreds every few days arriving they bring them in if it's if it's 300
[28:37.440 --> 28:42.320]  something at the high school that i went to in just the last year
[28:42.320 --> 28:45.840]  but they say it's only 50 something in the whole state of texas how big do you
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.760]  think the numbers really are joe let me get a look at it this way every time i
[28:49.760 --> 28:52.240]  fly i fly i spent three days here last week

[28:56.000 --> 28:59.120]  be gone through but we're getting reports out of jfk or whatever up in new
[28:59.120 --> 29:01.840]  york where they're just letting people out they're letting them fly through

[30:05.040 --> 30:09.440]  article up at info wars dot com paula jones who once sued bill clinton for
[30:09.440 --> 30:14.080]  sexual harassment tells inside addition how furious she is to see the former
[30:14.080 --> 30:17.280]  president campaigning for his wife hold on paula
[30:17.280 --> 30:21.920]  you're mad at bill clinton for campaigning for his wife but you're not

[30:24.320 --> 30:27.520]  dime bengazi you're not mad at the fact that there is a person who's being
[30:27.520 --> 30:31.680]  investigated by the fbi running for president and guess what she helped
[30:31.680 --> 30:34.960]  cover up what bill did to you but you're okay with her running but you're not
[30:34.960 --> 30:37.920]  okay with him being there that makes a lot of sense
[30:37.920 --> 30:41.520]  i can't believe he's got the nerve to do it jones a former arkansas state
[30:41.520 --> 30:45.120]  employee made headlines in 94 when she accused clinton proposition her and
[30:45.120 --> 30:48.400]  exposed him so clinton reportedly paid her 850
[30:48.400 --> 30:50.560]  thousand dollars in an out-of-court settlement
[30:50.560 --> 30:53.520]  although jones says she only walked away with 151 000

[36:23.760 --> 36:27.280]  moment but going back to joe bigs again i cannot

[36:41.280 --> 36:44.320]  course they're all foreigners how dare them set up and say
[36:44.320 --> 36:48.800]  the french did this or the germans did this or it's german men groping and
[36:48.800 --> 36:52.320]  raping women and pooping in the pool when you when you look at all the
[36:52.320 --> 36:56.000]  videos it's a bunch of out of control frothing jihadis
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.840]  that would have just been street gangs killing their own people months before
[36:59.840 --> 37:02.960]  and we're supposed to be accepting accepting that and we're supposed to sit
[37:02.960 --> 37:06.400]  here and watch what's happening over in europe and then allow that to happen
[37:06.400 --> 37:09.680]  here without saying anything like you said we're supposed to just bend over
[37:09.680 --> 37:13.440]  backwards for what is going on and just allow it to happen
[37:13.440 --> 37:17.920]  literally never and if we yeah exactly and if we get on social media
[37:17.920 --> 37:21.600]  you know mark zuckerberg angela merkel linked up together talking about how
[37:21.600 --> 37:24.400]  they want to ban any kind of anti-islamic speech or
[37:24.400 --> 37:28.320]  anything like that but now you have a daily mail german police arrest three
[37:28.320 --> 37:32.000]  islamist terrorists during raids at buildings including asylum seeker
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.600]  centers after tip-off of planned severe attacks
[37:35.600 --> 37:40.320]  of violence continues to happen is continuing to happen
[37:40.320 --> 37:43.680]  they said over 450 officers in raids across germany
[37:43.680 --> 37:48.480]  were hunting four algerians linked to isis a woman and two algerian men have
[37:48.480 --> 37:52.720]  been taken into custody one man arrested was wanted for training at an isis
[37:52.720 --> 37:56.000]  tear camp in syria but we're supposed to ignore
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.120]  that pretend like it's not happening um cover up
[37:59.120 --> 38:04.320]  jesus uh and uh just not even question the fact that our president
[38:04.320 --> 38:07.920]  is going to moss giving speeches denying christianity
[38:07.920 --> 38:12.240]  you know and pull on history gets up and did a speech criticizing radical
[38:12.240 --> 38:15.280]  christians and we even put a compilation together like before
[38:15.280 --> 38:19.360]  christmas you know any christian holiday he bad mouths christians
[38:19.360 --> 38:23.680]  oh it's happening what is the agenda i mean this is insane
[38:23.680 --> 38:27.200]  this you know what's happening you know scratch a what is it scratch a
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.520]  scratch a lie find a thief you know we're finding out who this man really
[38:31.520 --> 38:35.440]  is i do believe he is a muslim and he is trying
[38:35.440 --> 38:39.120]  to push that stuff i don't think it's any other thing than that i believe he is
[38:39.120 --> 38:42.720]  a muslim and he is a wahabi as to his funding
[38:42.720 --> 38:46.480]  a jihad not just against christians but against other muslim groups
[38:46.480 --> 38:50.240]  so even if he's not physically a muslim he might as well be because he's
[38:50.240 --> 38:53.680]  helping radical islam engage in mass murder look at syria
[38:53.680 --> 38:58.240]  when he aids in a bed zone i mean he's he's dropping off weapons to them he's
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.640]  allowing this stuff to happen they're giving bad intel to air force pilots
[39:02.640 --> 39:06.000]  so they think that they're dropping this stuff to so-called moderates when in
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.200]  fact it's actually isis and then you go out and see these videos these pictures
[39:09.200 --> 39:12.320]  these reports when you see these isis jihad he's running around with you
[39:12.320 --> 39:15.760]  know 240 bravos which is like an american machine gun
[39:15.760 --> 39:19.040]  or you know a saw which is a squad automatic weapon and what about the fact
[39:19.040 --> 39:22.320]  that they reported oh isis knows how to build
[39:22.320 --> 39:25.440]  stingers now then you read the article it stingers the us gave them
[39:25.440 --> 39:30.160]  they're just updating the battery yeah our government is run by criminals
[39:30.160 --> 39:34.080]  obama is aiding and abetting isis and the only candidate really talking about
[39:34.080 --> 39:36.560]  that now is donald trump thank you joe begs thank you
[39:36.560 --> 39:40.080]  that is joe begs former staff sergeant highly decorated us army
[39:40.080 --> 39:43.840]  and we point that out when he gets into isis and al qaeda because he is a ground
[39:43.840 --> 39:49.280]  level expert on it to again report on what's happening and unfolding
[39:49.280 --> 39:53.360]  now we are joined by the man that formerly headed up the strategy
[39:53.360 --> 39:56.720]  for donald trump's campaign he's a best-selling author
[39:56.720 --> 40:01.840]  researcher we sell many of his books and then for store.com for many years
[40:01.840 --> 40:06.160]  but his latest book deals with the sex crimes
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.080]  of bill clinton and how his wife hillary has been defending those
[40:10.080 --> 40:13.920]  he's got a new book coming out on the bushes as well but before we
[40:13.920 --> 40:18.160]  you know get to that he's also been exposing Ted Cruz and we saw a dirty
[40:18.160 --> 40:22.880]  trick with Ted Cruz the other night undoubtedly his campaign repeatedly
[40:22.880 --> 40:25.760]  tweeting that Ben Carson had quit leaving off the
[40:25.760 --> 40:29.680]  end part of CNN you know quit that night and gone home hadn't quit the campaign
[40:29.680 --> 40:35.600]  trail to try to get folks obviously to swing over to
[40:35.600 --> 40:39.840]  the Cruz campaign but but but getting away from that I want him to
[40:39.840 --> 40:43.680]  give us his breakdown of that going to new hampshire we see Marco Rubio
[40:43.680 --> 40:49.360]  suddenly surging because all the media says is Rubio Surging Rubio Surging Fox
[40:49.360 --> 40:53.120]  CNN MSNBC is that to cover up electioneering
[40:53.120 --> 40:57.760]  staging elections or is that to create kind of a perception that he's winning
[40:57.760 --> 41:01.360]  Mr. Stone has worked inside the campaigns of nine administrations he's
[41:01.360 --> 41:04.240]  worked inside three different whitehouses he's
[41:04.240 --> 41:07.440]  run pro-american campaigns around the world as well so he is
[41:07.440 --> 41:11.360]  a preeminent election expert I mean he's actually won more elections been
[41:11.360 --> 41:14.800]  involved in more serious stuff than something like a Carl Rove or a David
[41:14.800 --> 41:18.400]  Gergen in my view and so that's obviously why
[41:18.400 --> 41:21.920]  he's one of the top advisors to Donald Trump and he backs Trump because
[41:21.920 --> 41:24.960]  he believes he's the only purient establishment candidate
[41:24.960 --> 41:28.240]  if you see the demonization if you see Davos attacking Trump
[41:28.240 --> 41:31.440]  the Bilderberg group attacking Trump the editor of the financial times of
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.760]  London saying anybody but Trump and their money going it's Trump how could
[41:35.760 --> 41:40.000]  you not support Trump but separate from that
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.520]  now Hillary and what's happening with her so much to go over
[41:43.520 --> 41:49.920]  in just the 15 minutes or so that we have with Roger Stone of stonezone.com
[41:49.920 --> 41:53.520]  Roger I know you're very very busy man thank you for coming on with us today
[41:53.520 --> 41:58.400]  Alex I'm always honored to be with you because you cut right through the BS
[41:58.400 --> 42:02.000]  and you get right to the important stuff and let's face it there's a lot going on
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.240]  today wow well you heard me throw out a few of
[42:04.240 --> 42:07.760]  the pieces what's most important what should we focus on first
[42:07.760 --> 42:11.760]  well I do think that Trump is on to something here what was done to him in
[42:11.760 --> 42:15.680]  Iowa is insidious look dirty tricks or something I
[42:15.680 --> 42:19.280]  know a little bit about and this is a little more precision
[42:19.280 --> 42:22.880]  than people realize the Cruz people will fully
[42:22.880 --> 42:29.120]  planted a story on CNN on MSNBC that Ben Carson was getting out of the
[42:29.120 --> 42:32.640]  race prior to that they had prepared through an
[42:32.640 --> 42:37.200]  enormously expensive targeting and voter identification program
[42:37.200 --> 42:40.800]  a list of the phone numbers and emails of those who were for
[42:40.800 --> 42:44.720]  Carson those people were then contacted in the
[42:44.720 --> 42:51.040]  hours before the caucus and told CNN has reported Carson is getting out
[42:51.040 --> 42:57.040]  switch your vote to Cruz now just a shift of three votes
[42:57.040 --> 43:04.000]  per precinct from Carson to Cruz would have cheated Donald Trump
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.320]  out of his first place finished which is precisely what I think happened
[43:10.320 --> 43:13.600]  now the other thing I learned after enormous
[43:13.600 --> 43:20.080]  examination was how underprepared the Trump campaign was on the ground in
[43:20.080 --> 43:24.400]  Iowa in all honesty they ran a third rate campaign
[43:24.400 --> 43:28.800]  they did not have the kind of infrastructure and financing that they
[43:28.800 --> 43:34.240]  needed to identify and target their votes so
[43:34.240 --> 43:40.080]  Trump's incredible showing in Iowa despite those two disadvantages
[43:40.080 --> 43:44.560]  shows me again that there's something spontaneous
[43:44.560 --> 43:49.920]  and natural and real about the Trump phenomenon I agree this is a giant
[43:49.920 --> 43:54.000]  from vindication because despite dirty tricks despite no ground game
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.880]  despite having a campaign team that you know isn't
[43:56.880 --> 44:01.760]  uh as professionalism he still came in a dominant second
[44:01.760 --> 44:04.720]  should have been a huge landslide first place
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.600]  yes I think that's a very good recap so it speaks to the inherent strength of
[44:09.600 --> 44:12.640]  Trump now historically let's look at this
[44:12.640 --> 44:18.160]  Ronald Reagan skipped the last debate in Iowa was very controversial he was
[44:18.160 --> 44:21.680]  criticized for it he bounced back in New Hampshire
[44:21.680 --> 44:26.160]  he then won South Carolina which was by the way moved to the Saturday before
[44:26.160 --> 44:30.800]  the other southern primaries by some of my colleagues and I
[44:30.800 --> 44:35.040]  and then he won South Carolina meaning he was set up to sweep the South
[44:35.040 --> 44:41.120]  the nomination and the presidency history can repeat itself here Trump
[44:41.120 --> 44:45.760]  can win in New Hampshire I wish that he were there instead of South Carolina
[44:45.760 --> 44:49.840]  and Arkansas this week I don't call those shots
[44:49.840 --> 44:55.120]  but he he does still have a strong lead here's what's most interesting
[44:55.120 --> 44:59.040]  the guy crap crawling up his back according to an
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.200]  unaligned but very reliable pollster that I just hung up with
[45:03.200 --> 45:06.480]  one of the giants in Republican politics a guy who has
[45:06.480 --> 45:10.400]  no axe to grind tells me Trump is still number one in New Hampshire
[45:10.400 --> 45:16.800]  but Rubio is indeed moving up fast based as you said on the reports in the
[45:16.800 --> 45:19.280]  media that he's moving up fast it's a
[45:19.280 --> 45:23.840]  self-fulfilling prophecy here but the order of finish
[45:23.840 --> 45:27.200]  right now if it were held today in New Hampshire
[45:27.200 --> 45:30.880]  would be Trump first Rubio second and Cruz
[45:30.880 --> 45:34.560]  a distant third with Ben Carson then fourth
[45:34.560 --> 45:38.320]  so Rubio is the man to watch the Carson candidacy
[45:38.320 --> 45:42.480]  pardon me the Cruz candidacy in my opinion Alex has reached its high water
[45:42.480 --> 45:47.440]  mark in Iowa how big a game changer was it that he
[45:47.440 --> 45:50.720]  pulled that dirty trick and then it's done so so
[45:50.720 --> 45:55.040]  slickly where they take the front part of a CNN report cut the end off
[45:55.040 --> 45:58.720]  clearly had it all pre-planned when they got attacked to then come out and
[45:58.720 --> 46:02.560]  claim it was all a misunderstanding they covered their tracks a little too
[46:02.560 --> 46:04.880]  cleanly it's a little too open and shut it's
[46:04.880 --> 46:08.240]  blaring what they did when you read the five or six
[46:08.240 --> 46:13.360]  tweets and statements yeah I look at did it did it shift three votes per
[46:13.360 --> 46:17.520]  precinct it very well may have and a minimum though
[46:17.520 --> 46:22.960]  it has negated his victory he has had no bump he Ted Cruz
[46:22.960 --> 46:26.880]  has gotten no bump in the polls in New Hampshire
[46:26.880 --> 46:32.720]  I think his victory has now been solid is Iowa going to have a do-over no is
[46:32.720 --> 46:37.200]  there going to be a lawsuit no but Cruz doesn't get the momentum
[46:37.200 --> 46:40.400]  out of this that might normally be expected
[46:40.400 --> 46:43.680]  because of the circumstances of this revealed
[46:43.680 --> 46:49.600]  dirty trick again the establishment is rallying around Rubio
[46:49.600 --> 46:53.440]  Chris Christie John Kasich and the worst of all
[46:53.440 --> 46:57.600]  Jeb Bush these candidacies are moribund they're done
[46:57.600 --> 47:00.880]  Rubio is where the establishment is putting their money
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.040]  where they're putting their oomph and frankly at this point he is the man for
[47:05.040 --> 47:08.320]  Donald Trump to be well one more thing I like about Donald
[47:08.320 --> 47:11.840]  Trump is he's smart his crew is smart you're smart
[47:11.840 --> 47:15.040]  if you guys wanted to run this type of classical dirty trick you probably
[47:15.040 --> 47:17.600]  could have done this and gotten a bunch of Carson votes
[47:17.600 --> 47:22.720]  but you didn't do it and so plus I'm seeing these ads Trump talked about
[47:22.720 --> 47:26.320]  this where Trump wants your guns or Trump is for
[47:26.320 --> 47:29.680]  Obamacare or when everybody knows he's been against
[47:29.680 --> 47:33.680]  Obamacare from the start I mean they're really pulling out the lies right now
[47:33.680 --> 47:37.360]  and that segues into once you speak to that sir
[47:37.360 --> 47:40.960]  I think more than just push polling we know it's happening New Hampshire
[47:40.960 --> 47:45.200]  more than just a self-fulfilling prophecy of Marco Rubio surging Marco Rubio
[47:45.200 --> 47:48.960]  surging every channel you know he gets the establishment money
[47:48.960 --> 47:52.880]  Microsoft backing in Goldman Sachs all the usual players
[47:52.880 --> 47:56.240]  is that they may be getting ready to pull some hanky-panky in New Hampshire
[47:56.240 --> 47:59.680]  and they're just trying to sell the public that Rubio comes from nowhere
[47:59.680 --> 48:02.960]  and maybe even beats Trump or he comes in second as they're now
[48:02.960 --> 48:06.720]  saying in many polls coming out today and so they can then position him as the
[48:06.720 --> 48:10.160]  new leader to try to destroy Trump so obviously
[48:10.160 --> 48:14.080]  he's the guy to take down and he's so easy to take down because
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.960]  this guy is is about as conservative as Hillary Clinton when you really get to
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.000]  his whole history and his whole past I mean I am just
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.920]  Marco Rubio is just a piece of work so you know that's quite a mouthful but what
[48:25.920 --> 48:28.560]  do you say to that sir well I think you've got it
[48:28.560 --> 48:32.000]  exactly right look the Rubio people haven't been shy about this their
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.880]  strategy has always been three two one third place in Iowa
[48:36.880 --> 48:40.480]  second place in New Hampshire first place in South Carolina
[48:40.480 --> 48:44.480]  they've revealed their game plan and they're well positioned right now
[48:44.480 --> 48:48.240]  to pull that off I don't want to undersell
[48:48.240 --> 48:55.360]  Marco Rubio in terms of talent he is he is a very capable salesman
[48:55.360 --> 48:59.280]  and he puts the best face on being a neocon
[48:59.280 --> 49:02.480]  being a warmonger than I've ever seen he makes you feel
[49:02.480 --> 49:06.480]  patriotic about the fact that we should go off and march off and send men and
[49:06.480 --> 49:09.680]  women to war in countries where we have no inherent
[49:09.680 --> 49:13.440]  interest and it's really just being done to feed the
[49:13.440 --> 49:18.320]  emissions manufacturers but he puts a he puts a very
[49:18.320 --> 49:22.560]  compelling face on it don't underestimate this guy he's far more
[49:22.560 --> 49:27.600]  dangerous than say Jeb Bush because he's far more compelling
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.360]  but I don't think his rise in New Hampshire
[49:31.360 --> 49:37.360]  is artificial it's real he is coalescing the establishment people the
[49:37.360 --> 49:41.040]  establishment republican voters who like things
[49:41.040 --> 49:44.320]  just the way they are today who would be happier
[49:44.320 --> 49:47.840]  with a republican congress and a president Hilary Clinton
[49:47.840 --> 49:52.000]  if the alternative is Donald Trump you put your finger on it Alex
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.680]  the folks at Davos the people on Wall Street the lobbyist consulting class in
[49:57.680 --> 50:01.760]  Washington they are wetting their pants about the idea of a
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.440]  reform presidency under Donald Trump
[50:05.440 --> 50:09.920]  oh my god a guy we can't buy a guy we can't bully
[50:09.920 --> 50:13.440]  a guy who suspects the truth about 9-11
[50:13.440 --> 50:18.960]  a guy who is going to call fraud on all of the machinations of the political
[50:18.960 --> 50:22.640]  establishment um he really could be a revolutionary figure
[50:22.640 --> 50:25.760]  and he has scared the daylights out of the insiders
[50:25.760 --> 50:29.760]  there's the headline top builder bird global elite must stop Donald Trump
[50:29.760 --> 50:33.440]  and that is the financial times of London's editor who is
[50:33.440 --> 50:36.880]  especially their mouthpiece a guy that calls for totalitarian world
[50:36.880 --> 50:40.160]  government uh in in articles like and now for world
[50:40.160 --> 50:42.960]  government but but it's not just hype I mean you got very
[50:42.960 --> 50:46.320]  goldwater I think that's very goldwater in that painting behind you don't you
[50:46.320 --> 50:50.080]  yes indeed now folks that don't know who he was who were younger don't follow
[50:50.080 --> 50:52.880]  politics he was the proto Ron Paul I mean would have made
[50:52.880 --> 50:56.560]  an amazing president uh and free market type guy the whole
[50:56.560 --> 50:58.960]  nine-yard spoke out against the trial admiral commission
[50:58.960 --> 51:02.560]  the plan to take over America the globalist really Reagan was kind of I
[51:02.560 --> 51:06.160]  would say his protege to a great extent that's who's knees sat at
[51:06.160 --> 51:09.840]  and they sold it because goldwater was against all these wars in garbage a
[51:09.840 --> 51:12.000]  true republican a true constitutionalist in
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.680]  George Washington that he was going to start a nuclear war in the big mushroom
[51:15.680 --> 51:18.640]  cloud and kill everybody and that's exactly what they say with
[51:18.640 --> 51:22.400]  Trump he'll cause a big disaster he's a big warmonger when he's against all
[51:22.400 --> 51:25.760]  these different wars so it's an inversion of reality
[51:25.760 --> 51:30.160]  what do we do because obviously I don't think he's really slipped since
[51:30.160 --> 51:34.640]  um since what happened in Iowa but it could in some people's brain
[51:34.640 --> 51:39.360]  with this talking point his infallibility his invincibility aura shield is down
[51:39.360 --> 51:42.800]  it's down he's falling he's falling rubio rubio rubio's rising
[51:42.800 --> 51:46.160]  I mean they're like it's a horse race this isn't a horse race how do we make
[51:46.160 --> 51:49.600]  sure this doesn't happen point out that rubio looks like he's too young
[51:49.600 --> 51:53.200]  they're letting him come in he's got a bunch of dirt in his closet and he's
[51:53.200 --> 51:57.680]  designed to fall to Hilary because folks I'm no top expert like you but I've
[51:57.680 --> 52:00.240]  been watching this stuff for 30 years on air for 20
[52:00.240 --> 52:06.000]  Mr. Stone and to me if you put rubio in he is going to make sure Hilary wins one
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.920]  way or another probably a ringer and everybody deserves what they get then
[52:09.920 --> 52:13.200]  because we're not going to have separation of powers with Hilary
[52:13.200 --> 52:17.440]  she's going to go for broke and take over I know I'm ranting am I wrong or am I
[52:17.440 --> 52:20.720]  right no I think you're right look I think the easiest way
[52:20.720 --> 52:25.600]  to address the question of Marco Rubio vis a vis Donald Trump is to point out
[52:25.600 --> 52:30.560]  that rubio is funded by a cabal of Wall Street
[52:30.560 --> 52:36.320]  billionaires Paul Singer Sheldon Adelson the Koch brothers
[52:36.320 --> 52:40.160]  and billionaire car dealer Norman Brayman
[52:40.160 --> 52:44.960]  Marco's wife is on Brayman's a roll in what I suspect
[52:44.960 --> 52:50.400]  is a no-show job Marco does not have the independence
[52:50.400 --> 52:54.080]  that it would take to bring the fundamental reform
[52:54.080 --> 52:58.720]  that America needs to save ourselves so he he's a quizzling
[52:58.720 --> 53:03.600]  he's a very talented guy otherwise a very nice fellow I was in the green room
[53:03.600 --> 53:07.440]  at Fox with him last week he was very cordial we're both Feridians
[53:07.440 --> 53:10.480]  I voted for him in his race against Charlie
[53:10.480 --> 53:16.960]  Charlie Chris who was who was a rhino who was at that time a Republican in
[53:16.960 --> 53:21.120]  name only but Marco Rubio doesn't have the experience
[53:21.120 --> 53:25.920]  doesn't have the seasoning doesn't have the executive ability
[53:25.920 --> 53:29.360]  of a Donald Trump Trump is a guy who's built a multi
[53:29.360 --> 53:33.280]  billion-dollar business oh when you see Rubio give these speeches they're
[53:33.280 --> 53:36.720]  exactly cadence like a 10-year-old at a school
[53:36.720 --> 53:39.200]  play who's memorized it reminds me of my 11-year-old
[53:39.200 --> 53:42.320]  daughter at a school play she does a great job but it's memorized
[53:42.320 --> 53:46.880]  I mean he I'm not being mean he just he just comes off as amateurous
[53:46.880 --> 53:50.160]  he's not going to become the president folks if you don't vote for Trump
[53:50.160 --> 53:53.600]  in New Hampshire and in South Carolina it's a vote for Hillary Clinton so all
[53:53.600 --> 53:56.720]  you fake Republicans out there if you don't do this you mean you're you're
[53:56.720 --> 54:00.800]  the morons I look I totally agree Trump's problem
[54:00.800 --> 54:05.520]  here is a fundamental one and that is before he can dispatch Marco Rubio
[54:05.520 --> 54:10.720]  he must first dispose of Ted Cruz Ted Cruz at this point has no prospect of
[54:10.720 --> 54:15.040]  being the nominee and although I have to admit I was initially very impressed
[54:15.040 --> 54:18.480]  with Ted and his current rhetoric and his brief
[54:18.480 --> 54:21.840]  record in the U.S. Senate when I dug in further
[54:21.840 --> 54:27.840]  everything I found was troubling he was a top issue advisor to George W. Bush
[54:27.840 --> 54:31.360]  it was Ted Cruz who recruited John Roberts
[54:31.360 --> 54:35.520]  to the Bush team John Roberts his Supreme Court Justice would ultimately
[54:35.520 --> 54:40.000]  deal with Obamacare Ted went to Harvard and Princeton
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.520]  not many conservatives coming out of there I'm just saying
[54:43.520 --> 54:48.320]  as he would say uh his wife Heidi Deputy
[54:48.320 --> 54:54.640]  NSC Director to Condoleezza Rice then Deputy U.S. Trade Representative
[54:54.640 --> 54:58.160]  to Robert Zellick where she worked on our current China
[54:58.160 --> 55:01.920]  trade policy by the way Alex those things are airbrushed out of her wiki
[55:01.920 --> 55:05.760]  biography like they never happened then she goes on to work for
[55:05.760 --> 55:09.040]  Goldman Sachs and it turns out that the that the
[55:09.040 --> 55:14.960]  cruises have a secret sweetheart loan from Goldman Sachs to finance his
[55:14.960 --> 55:20.080]  Senate race and then Ted lies and says no no the money to finance my Senate
[55:20.080 --> 55:23.280]  race came from my wife cashing out her retirement
[55:23.280 --> 55:28.000]  but there was no cash out of her retirement turns out it's alone
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.880]  now we learned that Heidi Cruz is a member of the Council on Foreign
[55:30.880 --> 55:33.760]  Relations where she worked on some of their crazy
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.200]  lefty one-world government schemes bottom line
[55:37.200 --> 55:40.640]  I just don't trust Ted Cruz I don't really believe
[55:40.640 --> 55:44.080]  that he's a conservative I think he's a self-styled
[55:44.080 --> 55:47.680]  Trojan horse with a very short record as a conservative
[55:47.680 --> 55:51.520]  to position him solely for this race he is an insider
[55:51.520 --> 55:55.520]  acting like an officer so he could be the ultimate sleeper operative
[55:55.520 --> 55:59.280]  I think he is the Canadian Manchurian candidate
[55:59.280 --> 56:03.040]  he's in this race right now to draw votes from Donald Trump
[56:03.040 --> 56:07.760]  so that Donald Trump can fall to Marco Rubio it's a one-two play
[56:07.760 --> 56:12.560]  I'm sorry I just don't buy the idea that Ted Cruz is committed to the
[56:12.560 --> 56:16.080]  liberal agenda he's committed to the CFR agenda
[56:16.080 --> 56:19.520]  to the Goldman Sachs agenda what do we do then I mean look
[56:19.520 --> 56:23.040]  obviously we get your book put that on screen we sell it we bought a bunch of
[56:23.040 --> 56:26.320]  them they're selling out info wars store.com

[56:40.560 --> 56:44.480]  get out there vote in these primaries speak out Trump is still the leader
[56:44.480 --> 56:48.720]  but the brainwashing has gone into high gear he's got to win New Hampshire big
[56:48.720 --> 56:52.080]  you've got to talk to folks in that state and just say look the whole
[56:52.080 --> 56:54.320]  establishment's against Trump it's real
[56:54.320 --> 56:57.680]  it's not rhetoric the money's against him you're idiots
[56:57.680 --> 57:01.360]  if you don't support Trump it's so obvious some people a minority of them
[57:01.360 --> 57:04.720]  say Alex you never endorse candidates you know why are you just
[57:04.720 --> 57:08.160]  frothing over Trump look I was invited to hang out with Bush when he was a
[57:08.160 --> 57:11.280]  governor to be part of that stuff I was invited by the Clinton's early on they
[57:11.280 --> 57:14.320]  try to get everybody to be on their team I didn't join Clinton because they
[57:14.320 --> 57:16.960]  invited me to go to some event that Clinton was going to be at when I was
[57:16.960 --> 57:21.840]  23 years old I'm not joining you know Trump because he came on my show or
[57:21.840 --> 57:24.720]  what it's because I see the whole systems against him
[57:24.720 --> 57:28.960]  I mean do people just need to understand that that that it's obvious this is
[57:28.960 --> 57:32.480]  going on let me lay this out for you I really
[57:32.480 --> 57:36.080]  believe that Hillary Clinton can be defeated
[57:36.080 --> 57:41.280]  but she cannot be defeated the way say John McCain took on Barack Obama
[57:41.280 --> 57:44.400]  traveling all over the United States talking about what a great guy and what
[57:44.400 --> 57:48.560]  a great senator Barack Obama was to be Hillary you got to get right
[57:48.560 --> 57:52.800]  up in her grill yep destroyer her with her role
[57:52.800 --> 57:56.800]  as an accessory after the fact in threatening and intimidating
[57:56.800 --> 58:01.840]  and bullying bills sexual assault victims you have to get right up in her
[58:01.840 --> 58:06.480]  grill on her disastrous tenure as Secretary of State where she is in
[58:06.480 --> 58:09.360]  essence functioned as an operative for the Muslim
[58:09.360 --> 58:12.320]  Brotherhood betraying our allies in the Middle East
[58:12.320 --> 58:16.320]  and setting up our enemies and then lastly you have to go after the
[58:16.320 --> 58:20.240]  epic corruption of the Clinton Foundation now
[58:20.240 --> 58:23.520]  Donald Trump is uniquely positioned to do that why
[58:23.520 --> 58:26.560]  because he gave a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars to the Clinton
[58:26.560 --> 58:30.720]  Foundation believing that he was giving to a charity
[58:30.720 --> 58:33.760]  he didn't know they were going to Mr. Stone I know you've got to go soon 70

[59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.360]  the genesis communications radio network probably presents
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:08.160]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.800]  ladies and gentlemen if i was a sociopath or a psychopath
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.480]  i would be trying to get hillary clinton elected
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.520]  i would not be actually opposing her with everything i've got
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.040]  even risking my life and having top whistleblowers on routinely
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.240]  and having the justice department snooping around my life
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:31.200]  and the irs harassing people but i do it because i care about my family
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.400]  and if hillary got elected that'll make talk radio and what libertarian
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.640]  conservatives do even bigger but the country's gonna die
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.240]  there isn't much time left just like that great article in politico
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.920]  you know how donald trump did it i think was the headline and he was really
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.880]  planning agonizing it's got roger stone in it
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.320]  you know debating you know when he should get in the race when he shouldn't
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.520]  there he is you know really deciding hey i can't let him destroy this country does
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.000]  that mean trumps perfect no the point is he's not owned by them
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.960]  and they're scared and it just comes down to that and i can tell you're really
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.320]  engaged in this as well mr stone so closing points
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.560]  on what we do to make sure he wins and what we do to stop the dirty tricks
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.640]  what we do to make sure he dominates so that he can destroy hillary clinton
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.240]  in the upcoming election yeah i mean sadly if the party
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.760]  nominates uh either ted Cruz or marco rubio neither one of them will engage
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.320]  hillary on the issues in which she's engaged you know just weeks ago she tried
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.560]  to play the gender card and down front gamed it right back down her
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.200]  throat no hillary you're not an advocate for women
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.160]  you're an abuser of women you have terrified and terrorized uh and bullied
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.560]  women who've gotten the way of your and your husband's rise to power
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.760]  only trump will take that fight to her the others will fold even ran paul who i
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.320]  like tossed this softball in the last debate
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.240]  took a total pass let it go right over softballs with a way to lose notice when
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.280]  trump hammered her with it you don't want to go there hillary
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.280]  with all your defending bill the abuser it's disgusting that that's his quote
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.280]  she shut up so quick and that bully put her tail between her legs
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.560]  yeah no and now she says she's not going to respond
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.600]  to any of these charges which by the way won't work
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:23.120]  because i'm convinced that hillary's victims uh very brave and courageous
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.320]  women like wanita broadwood cathleen willie
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.160]  sally miller paul and jones you're going to see them
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.080]  all over television this fall if donald trump is the nominee
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:38.480]  you're going to see them speaking out specifically about what happened to them
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.400]  at the hands of bill and then at the hands of hillary
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.680]  only trump can spearhead an effort to take her on
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.600]  frontally these other candidates their job is to lose
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.040]  and then the congressional republicans go back to a cozy relationship that's
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.400]  right democratic uh president uh and this country
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.360]  goes down the drain and they blame the takeover agenda on the democrats which
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.360]  they've worked with we got a minute and a half left
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.800]  i want to talk about both your books m4store.com exposing the bushes and the
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.840]  clintons everybody's got to get these and get them out to the people you know
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.240]  that are undecided but in closing prediction so far if trump continues on
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.480]  his course how does this break out in uh the upcoming
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.160]  primaries uh in new hampshire in south caroline and other areas
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.640]  well here is the good news look i've been a a critic uh of trump's campaign in
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.200]  iowa i've also been the biggest booster of
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.440]  trump's candidacy on television you'll see me again this weekend on
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:36.000]  cnn with mike smirkanish on saturday morning uh on uh on fox
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.120]  yeah why doesn't trump bring you back to head stuff up right now my god because
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.360]  every time he follows your strategy he wins well trump is his own strategist
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:47.280]  and you really can't argue with it he's gotten himself as far as he has
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.800]  i frankly think i can do more good from the outside
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.320]  appearing on programs like this and telling folks what's
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.920]  really going on so tell us what happens in 60 seconds sorry
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.560]  very simple here's the good news donald trump's organization in south caroline
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.720]  is second to none he has the very best people in the
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.080]  business there and they know what they're doing
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:16.480]  they are superbly well organized uh and they have developed their own
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.560]  targeting and and uh voter profiling information
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.880]  so if trump can win new hampshire he is poised to win big in south carolina
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:31.280]  which i by the way predict will be a face-off with marco rubio
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.520]  and ted cruz will be an afterthought if he wins south carolina
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.080]  and he will he is then poised to sweep the south and he will be the nominate
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.320]  whole new ballgame it will be the worst day in the life
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.280]  of hillary and bill clinton that's what they're saying if he gets it it's going
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.240]  to be a landslide he'll take new york that that that republicans don't normally
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.960]  get uh wow it's incredible thank you so much mr stone for all you do stone
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.480]  zone dot com find about those books there as well thank you sir
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:03.120]  joe biggs here with info wars dot com obama hit jesus at catholic university
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:07.040]  but allows a lot to be widely displayed during islamic center speech
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.920]  so it should be pretty obvious now to everyone at this point in time that
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.120]  president obama does indeed have a double standard when it comes to
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.600]  religions especially if it rhymes with christian
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.680]  this article is up at info wars dot com from declaring that the united states
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.920]  is no longer a christian nation to denying syrian christians entry into
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.760]  the country president obama's distaste for the followers of jesus are as
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.960]  obvious as it knows on your face but with less than a year left in his
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.560]  presidency obama hasn't given up on dissing christians at every
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.640]  opportunity for example president obama gave a speech at a mosque in the
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:42.480]  islamic society of baltimore on wednesday while standing in front of a
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.120]  glass wall where the word a lot was written 99 times in arabic calligraphy
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:50.400]  the president took a stab at a republican presidential hopeful donald
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.560]  trump by stating there was an excusable anti islamic rhetoric in the
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.240]  political sphere this has been joe base with info wars dot com

[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.800]  they were committing larry nickles and by the way larry didn't even want us to
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.720]  show him on camera well it was we was like amen at the top of his head

[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.920]  over how they call anybody conspiracy theorists that criticized them for
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.800]  crimes and how they couldn't allow any media liberal or
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.240]  conservative to develop that they didn't control and it was them threatening

[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:58.880]  fight through because alex this is the last chance we get
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.720]  to try to do anything to save this country and
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.840]  to be quite honest it's now or never and as you saw in the isle of caulk is
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.800]  uh cruise has taken several of the plays out of
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:18.000]  the playbook for the clinton's dirty tricks and uh
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.360]  i'd like to tell you about something that's going on infamy which is a little
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.120]  bit out of the clinton world but i got some news about the clinton world
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.960]  out of the clinton world you need to know folks
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:34.480]  the national chambers of commerce man named donahue
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:42.240]  they were pouring millions millions into stopping trump
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.920]  they're in bed with carl rove and the boys and that's where a lot of the funding
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.640]  but alex here's the kicker the r&c with carl rove the
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.400]  establishment they've gone around the fox to
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.880]  mark levin to limbaugh to you name it they've gone to all the glendak all of
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.880]  these places putting pressure on them
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.840]  to stop trump talk bad about it and that's inside baseball i want you to
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:12.000]  break it down the good news is limbaugh has pretty much said no to them
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.680]  and boy the word is they're going after him now they're gonna have to be
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.440]  you know i'm proud of limbaugh because he's you bet he's done some good some bad
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.080]  but here at the here at the end i think he's choosing america
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:27.920]  well i think even rest limbaugh understands there are times in this
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:32.560]  country alex where you have to go beyond self
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.840]  now it might be easier for limbaugh with the millions he's got to be able to
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.400]  have integrity i don't know but thank god he has fought it and is fighting it
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:47.760]  to date now hillary here's the news about that
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:53.280]  hillary has warned that if they indict her
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:59.360]  she will release all all the information she has on
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:06.000]  everyone in washington even republicans alex are going
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.360]  to obama say don't indict her she will destroy
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:15.280]  washington i happen to know what she has
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.520]  she released she can release all of the secrets
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.760]  that are to never be told about washington dc and she is holding that
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:29.280]  over their heads and if anybody wonders why there can be all of this evidence
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.880]  and yet no indictment that's why they also got to know
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:40.000]  she's very upset that she has a shadow candidacy

[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:14.560]  post it to info wars and then post part of the article under it with our link to
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:18.240]  jacari jackson's report a year and a half ago
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.080]  with the emergency manager of mccallen texas
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.200]  saying we've been ordered to ship the illegals and load them on buses
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:29.360]  and the border patrol pays to ship them into the u.s this has been going on for
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:33.440]  two years this is an examiner article border
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.720]  agent we might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether they're
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.320]  being told don't show up to court don't do anything
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.160]  might as well abolish immigration laws it's already been done by fiat folks
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.280]  that's why they're told let the illegals in from all over the world
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:50.320]  landing at jfk and then just keeps happening every
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:55.120]  day and they go oh it's an accident it's not an accident folks
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.360]  fine let all the illegals in and drive down the wages that we implode
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.720]  here's the issue citizens still are going to be harassed
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.320]  and be groped and it's see it's a takeover a criminal
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:09.920]  takeover and the sky's the limit and the republicans will do nothing and they
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:13.520]  say donald trump's disqualified for saying stop
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:17.760]  this we have no nation this is global government
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.640]  that's what's happening and thank god it's finally another newspapers after us
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:26.480]  exposing in a year and a half ago i don't want to be the only one
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:30.320]  exposing this they asked the border agent about it on fox news six months
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.960]  after we hear reports that you helped ship them in he goes
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:36.800]  yes it's secret i can't tell you but we're ordered to quote
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.720]  complete the smuggling process in fact i want to find that clip
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:44.240]  headline border agent tells fox we're ordered to complete smuggling process
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.680]  i want to find that clip larry over this till 45 after i'm stealing time here
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:50.320]  from your ranting it just shows how dire our
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.200]  straights are getting back to the clinton strategies
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.640]  to continue all of this but it just shows how blatant they just ignore
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:01.840]  whatever laws they want while throwing the irs book
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:08.320]  at the tea party yeah you know alex this is what i've tried to tell and i know
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:14.080]  you and i both that what we told this 23 years ago about bill clinton
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.080]  this is what they want this is what they're doing and when you think in
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.400]  terms folk of the folks v legals you better think
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.480]  of a driver's license and you better think of voting
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.560]  that's why i say to you all this is our last election
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:34.640]  oh there'll be other elections but this is the last one if we don't win where we
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.320]  will be relevant now back to hillary alex she's
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.080]  got the files on all of them i'm talking about the raw fbi data
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.520]  the stuff she can tell she will bring them all down
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:49.040]  and she has made it quite clear you indict me
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:54.320]  everyone goes i hear all the time what's this new fbi director to me or whatever
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:59.280]  and he's beyond reproach he is da da da are you kidding me folks i don't care
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:03.760]  if he's a republican i don't care if he's the pope do you really
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:08.880]  believe obama would appoint someone to head up the fbi
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:18.000]  that he doesn't control surely you don't now back to this race with trump
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.520]  alex i like to give two reasons and normally you know normally i don't come
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:25.920]  on and endorse or not endorse any candidate i don't do that
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:31.120]  my job is stay with the clinton's and do what i vowed to do
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:35.040]  but see what trump is different trump is not a politician
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:38.480]  that's a good point number one now he's bought several of them he'll admit that
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:43.200]  he's bought them and he's not one and then when i see the massive
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.040]  effort in some cases alex i think you're right it's unprecedented
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.880]  what the party the establishment is doing
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:57.840]  to bring him down that's the greatest endorsement the man could have
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.960]  but then hillary getting out it never happened
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:04.960]  you know alex for everybody that's listening and you enter you're getting
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.960]  fed up and you think well my gosh how much more has got to come out on the

[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:20.160]  and her crew brought it out they know the end of this game with the
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.560]  emails if she gets prosecuted her defense attorney's gonna say well give us
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:27.040]  all of those documents and we're gonna have to use them in our defense and
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:30.400]  you're gonna say whoa we can't give you those documents to use in your defense
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.520]  and you said that was gonna happen now they've declared him reclassified you
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:36.960]  said that four months ago they do that yeah they've done the exact thing
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.000]  yeah so you're not gonna be so it's gonna be no price
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.200]  and hillary knows that so biden and lisbeth ward even though they're setting

[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.480]  make trouble for them people that had guns and things they wanted they just
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:20.480]  took them away where reeducation camps that's what
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:23.920]  they call it so part of it we have to break through our kind of private idea
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:27.680]  that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.880]  the kids belong to whole communities i have decided
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:38.320]  we really need camps for adults and we need the type of camps
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.480]  that you all run i mean really all persons of japanese dissent were
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:45.680]  required to register now they were taken to racetracks and
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.040]  fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:54.400]  i'm a star citizen i refuse to recognize you guys what kind of a situation in the
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.720]  u.s would you see that happening i mean we've got a lot of
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.360]  competition with a lot of people that it's not
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.560]  filed with um plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:05.280]  military that have the ability and the knowledge to
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:10.480]  to build ied's and to defeat law enforcement techniques
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:14.560]  these people are radicalized and they don't support the united states and
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.440]  they're disloyal to the united states it's our right
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:23.120]  and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.680]  this hope is doing here and let's not kid about it we're building a domestic
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.000]  army because the government is afraid of its own
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.640]  citizens put your gun down really
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.600]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:50.160]  it's alex jones are you some kind of a constitutionalist
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.520]  so these people will hold themselves out
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:58.400]  to be patriots or not they're nothing more than domestic terrorists
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:14.960]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:17.840]  but it's a new kind of war they're destroying our economy they're
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.640]  imploding our borders they are bringing independence
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:25.680]  who can be a new political class they are openly demonizing free speech
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.720]  and they're trying to set us up and prepare for war with the military and the
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.720]  police and my message to the military and police is this
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.880]  that's why i give a big donation to the fallen police officers program and also
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:39.440]  you know for the police officers program they have kids they have cancer and
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.160]  stuff same way you can get money to mills on wheels and the rest of it and
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.440]  the Salvation Army because i'm trying to do good here i don't want to be enemies
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.720]  with the police but let me tell you the enemies have seized this country
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.920]  you got the border patrol coming out saying it's all gone we're told let
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:55.280]  everybody go there's no border it's total treason
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.200]  you understand our government is captured by criminals
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:02.560]  americans have a right right now to physically fight back that's not smart
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:05.760]  strategy at this point but they're preparing down the road when we lose
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.760]  these battles to come after the patriots and then it all kicks off because
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:13.600]  folks just can't go along with it
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:19.760]  we're living in history right now that's why i aired that red dawn intro
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:23.360]  but it came from within not from without folks came from golden sacks who's
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:27.680]  come out today i'm gonna give this after larry leaves us
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:32.320]  this is a very important article golden sacks says it may be forced to
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:35.920]  fundamentally question on capitalism is working and it goes on to basically
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:40.480]  say golden sacks says that it does that it doesn't have
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:48.000]  efficacy that it's not ethical so golden sacks comes in set up after 1900
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.280]  uses its money to fund the bolshevik revolution
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.120]  uses money to create crony capitalism to take our tax money
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:01.360]  that's bloomberg reporting this and now is set to destroy it blaming it for
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.520]  what it's done when it runs the whole show
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:07.280]  that's beautiful and who's it run hillary clinton and ted cruz
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:10.400]  who who does it hate who's who's not given one dollar
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.960]  that'd be smart for them to slip a donation and that trump doesn't even
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.520]  know about and say oh look we gave a donation
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:19.760]  the point is is that don't give my ideas the point is i mean this is it
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.680]  this is the crony capitalist wrecking your ladder up they're in the hot air
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.720]  balloon they already got off the ground they want to cut that rope
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.880]  so you can't get up there and then laugh at you and blame
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:36.320]  that on the patriot movement so uh there you go ladies and gentlemen and the
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.840]  more socialism they call for the more there's a tiny
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:42.640]  one half of one tenth of one percent that has all the wealth
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:46.320]  then they sick the giant unwashed masses they can't pay for anything on the
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.920]  middle class it's annihilated and the ladder up the
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:55.520]  stairway up to wealth is gone and you commit us to third world status
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.760]  an elite victory you know latin america and africa and eastern europe
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.520]  and asia don't need to be third world you know their elites write books bragging
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.080]  they keep them poor outside their armored fortresses
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:13.120]  that's what makes them god they can buy your your daughter for a dollar
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:17.200]  in places like thailand and now you're going to live it here you're going to be
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.840]  good slaves and larry you know you're
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.640]  did a lot of classified stuff i know in the military and central and south
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:25.680]  america we ought to have you on for a full hour sometimes just to talk about
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:28.880]  your experiences and things you did i know a lot of stuff with the clintons
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.000]  was illegal so you can't really get into that that's some of the you know bodies
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.280]  are buried stuff which i don't know but sometimes it's just good to get that
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.080]  stuff out there i know you're keeping it as an ace in the hole
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.440]  and obviously uh you know if you do die from this cancer which we hope doesn't
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.600]  happen i'm sure a lot of that's going to come out i just
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:47.520]  wonder the folks that have it are are have got the wavos you've got and and
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:50.880]  will release it i do not have it and that's not because i'm even afraid
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.400]  i'm afraid to lose my life for nothing thinking i have something i don't
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.600]  uh but but but but getting back to the clintons getting back to where we are
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:01.600]  in a society getting back to the world we're in what their next moves are you
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:05.120]  were warning ted cruise saying i've got the dirt on you buddy
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.720]  you know you're never going to be there uh i mean i i say just go ahead and start
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:13.760]  bringing that out now to torpedo him and and i and then let's expand into rubio
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:18.800]  well i intend to one of the things that needs to be done right now about i when
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:22.480]  they better do it quick this is a suggestion but and i know because i did
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:26.560]  it against the clintons how do you think i got him impeached
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:33.520]  um men karson needs to file a complaint with the fcc he also needs to go
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:37.600]  across the street and file a federal complaint in the federal
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.800]  court now he needs to find three people or trump somebody
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:47.920]  needs to find three people that we're gonna vote for karson went
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.680]  into that room when they heard that flipped their vote
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:57.200]  and with those three people they can file a theft by deception charge criminal
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:03.920]  charge against cruise trust me cruise is done now i don't have
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:07.840]  standing but that has never stopped me before of interceding in
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.440]  something that i felt like i needed to intercede in
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:16.560]  then then you got to know about rubio see you have to know the confidential
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.720]  flow chart their strategy flow charts the uh
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:25.280]  what do you what do you want to call them the hierarchy the establishment
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:29.680]  chain of command want chain of command well this is a flow chart for
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:34.880]  how to push get it folks you're not gonna believe it jeb bush in
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.560]  you see jeb bush is sitting there now if trump
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:44.800]  if rubio and cruise beat trump and drive them out then it'll be rubio and
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.880]  cruise then they have the same stuff on cruise that i have
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:53.920]  and then when they get rid of cruise they're gonna go after rubio
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:42:00.480]  now they're gonna point out that rubio's queer and then that ain't me i'm
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:04.880]  telling you what they're gonna do they're gonna point out that he is about
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:08.400]  his homosexual acquires there is a homosexual queer
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.760]  and once again that's not me rubio that's them when they eliminate cruise
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:21.120]  rubio and they have done away with trump guess who's in line then buddy
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:24.080]  jeb bush and you got a broker an election which insiders admit they're
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:27.760]  planning they're a broker in the election you hear
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.600]  folks in a primary i've told you before alex has told you
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:38.160]  in a primary it's all about money who has the most money stays till the end
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:42.400]  and then you've got somebody that's an oddbark like trump
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:46.240]  here comes trump he doesn't need that money he'll do it on his own
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:50.000]  but they plan to remove him they plan to get rid of him and use cruise and rubio
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.960]  to do it and i will not let that stand
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:57.600]  i will not and trust me alex i don't know how much you know
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:01.280]  about ted cruise but uh no i don't ever want to know
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:05.280]  anything about people individually until it's time to drop the hammer on him
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:07.920]  and then i want to know that information right the moment it's released
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:10.960]  where i'm not standing next to the explosion
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.520]  well ted cruise is not what he's purported to be
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:19.120]  i mean anyway i'm gonna leave it at that for now but don't worry
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.080]  hell's coming to cruise trust me hillary
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:28.000]  hillary's safe i still get this tough what she's gonna be
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.840]  indicted she's gonna be indicted alex think about it
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:36.640]  if hillary was going to be indicted with the email thing
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:40.160]  there's enough evidence there and we have everything else in gauze the list goes
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.520]  on wrong well then what about this what about the fbi then releasing its
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:47.040]  investigation saying she should have they can't
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.320]  in fact i saw articles now that they're not releasing the white water
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:54.240]  uh draft indictments they had on her for that no i mean
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:44:00.400]  they're gonna if to me it really has put a hundred fbi agents that are above
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:04.720]  everybody and we're really doing a good job he's got to submit
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:11.280]  to loretta lynch he's got to submit the case to her and then she's got to make
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:16.080]  the decision whether to prosecute and i'm telling you guys
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:22.320]  nobody in washington won't hillary indict it because it means their end
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:29.680]  it's their end so just know quit worrying about the fbi if to me
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.800]  the fbi director is as squeaky clean as everybody's
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:35.600]  don't understand haven't we reached a moment though
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:39.840]  because a lot of evidence is that the fbi director jager hoover didn't
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.440]  didn't die like they said in his bedroom uh but but they were sick of him
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:47.040]  blackmailing both sides and so he kind of had a little accident
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.920]  and i'm not saying i want that to happen to hillary i'm not at that level i don't
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:52.000]  want to be involved i'm a guy that just sits here and
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.680]  looks at the info because i want to be here at the end of this for my kids
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:58.800]  uh i'm not going to be even bolder stuff and i do the point is i don't play in
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:01.840]  the cloak and dagger channel right but when i've seen stuff like this
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.320]  historically when when everybody's lined up
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:08.160]  everybody's at loggerheads there's a stalemate usually one side of the other
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:11.840]  is going to jump people are going to start getting killed
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:17.920]  you know alex i'm afraid you're right i really am i'm afraid you're right now
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:21.120]  remember this is a plague that stays with the clintons
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:24.320]  whenever the clintons are involved when he was governor
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.640]  when bill clinton was president people die around this
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:34.320]  couple like you have never seen and i'm afraid that what you're describing
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:39.360]  may be on someone's drawing board someone's
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:43.440]  hillary right now had better be getting her butt puckered
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:49.600]  because she's right between in a way obama's in the same shape i am
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:54.000]  he's in between hillary and some something she's wanted since she was four
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.160]  years old the only way to get rid of a problem who's
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.440]  already convicted in the court of public opinion is bringing your party down
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.080]  with her losing every state and every governorship
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:05.920]  is to make her a hero where she falls down has a stroke
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:10.000]  that's that's about it remember this hillary's going to come out of this
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  email scandal and you might as well just get ready for the
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.200]  for the reports it's going to be oh these mean old
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:22.000]  right wing conservative republicans conspiracy they've thrown all these
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.440]  things about the emails and they knew there was she said it again last night
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:29.600]  she said the vast right wing conspiracy has gotten better funding
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.520]  yeah and then it's all there but think about it folks
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:38.400]  she lived through it and i'll tell you she's wanting to lose
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.600]  new hampshire she she she wanted to lose Iowa but then
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:47.600]  it looked like it might be such a negative that she backed out
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:53.680]  but hillary has got to lose new hampshire for her playbook to actually work
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:58.480]  she's got to be alex the underdog you can never run a clinton
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:02.720]  never run a clinton until they're the underdog and then they will rise up out
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.760]  of the and then she says i'm under attack protect me and i'll
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.880]  protect you and then all of her followers feel like
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.120]  she needs them and they're part of her life it's all a big sucker job
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:16.880]  that's right but bill and hillary count on
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:22.240]  we the people to be the first three rows of a wrestling match alex the first
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:27.680]  three rows of a raster wrestling match as the clintons
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.120]  and i used to define it those are the people that sit right up on the front
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:35.760]  three rows you can obviously see the fighters
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:38.960]  drawing their punches you can see that they're all tricks they're not really
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:41.840]  hitting each other straighten the nose with a brick
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:46.400]  you see all of that you're right there but then they get up and believe it
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:49.280]  and walk out let's spend a few minutes separately
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:52.800]  on when we come back from break on what you think trump
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:55.760]  should do to win and what we can do to help him do that because obviously the
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:59.120]  whole system's against him it's for real it's not show it's not a foil but
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.520]  separate let's get for just two three months before you go to break
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:04.720]  into how you got recruited by the clintons what you were doing in the
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:08.080]  special forces in latin america and how that expertise
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:11.600]  you know helped you now see what's happening to america itself
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:18.960]  well i have been i've been involved in a lot of things in different operations
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.800]  and i had decided i was through with that that's ended up going to work for bill
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.960]  at the arkansas development finance authority i had seen too much it was
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:30.400]  getting too rough and i noticed in the racket i was in
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:36.800]  alex there were no gray hairs and what i mean by that nobody lived beyond 35
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:40.560]  when you got to 35 you'd been in the middle of enough stuff that you knew
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:43.600]  too much so now they throw you into missions that you're not going to come
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.880]  out alive that's exactly what i saw with my family as well it's
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:51.600]  incredible yeah so then i'd had it went to bill said i
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:55.120]  need a good job for a few months just to cool off he put me at the arkansas
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:59.040]  development finance authority made me the marketing director
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.720]  and uh i'd been there a couple weeks and i got to noticing
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:06.480]  well they don't do what it says it does and that's when they showed me the
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.720]  second set of books now at the same time that went down
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:16.720]  a don focalero head of the contrast called me and said larry congressman
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:21.280]  tommy robinson wants to come down here and he's your friend you've got to bring
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.360]  him i said whoa i'm not coming back and in that conversation
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:30.000]  the awful said what is this contra drug money stuff
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.600]  and alex i was there if they were selling drugs
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:39.520]  selling cocaine for weapons i didn't see it and i was on the ground
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:44.080]  but it made me check it out and lo and behold what i found folks
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.760]  is a hundred million dollars a month where did i come up with that figure i
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:51.440]  came up with that figure from the books i had it at the
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:55.360]  a hundred million a month was being laundered through the arkansas
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.560]  development finance authority through dan laster's brokerage firm
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:04.560]  and distributed by don tyson and tyson foods
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:08.560]  and so i went to bill and said bill here's what's going on
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:12.560]  he played like he didn't know anything about it i knew who's lying he knew i
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:16.320]  knew who's lying remember who i was and uh
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:21.760]  that's when our war started alex i they started roasting me
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:25.520]  and you see i was brought into bill in the first place by a man named mr witt
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:29.040]  stevens he and his brother witt and jack stevens owned
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:34.160]  arkansas louisiana gas and they were the king makers of the day
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:37.120]  they owned everything you didn't run for dog catcher in a
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:42.720]  humnoke arkansas unless they approved it and mr witt told me there was a boy
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:45.200]  that he wanted me to make to be governor and he was attorney general
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:49.360]  that's when and how i met bill clinton and that's how i met hittery
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:53.200]  and uh larry nickle stay there we'll be right back and finish up the story and

[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.560]  wars dot com lawmaker says he's never read anything that's more
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:50.480]  sensitive than information and helary's top secret emails republican chris stewart
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:53.360]  yeah can you imagine what she's really doing with all this
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:56.640]  and a lot of intel is and i and i think she might have put really super secret
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:00.800]  stuff in there as a form of blackmail knowing people to get it and then she
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.720]  could threaten to have that come out in the investigation they leaked to begin
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:08.400]  with to bring down all of washington's self and that what's in the emails is the
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:11.360]  threat itself and that's what nickles handed at
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:15.680]  six months ago and now i'm putting pieces together i see him nodding am i on
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:19.680]  to something here yeah you're exactly where you're supposed to be
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.960]  that's how it works i like you just lay down the play
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:26.160]  we used to call him scams that's the scam
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:30.880]  she couldn't hold washington at bay unless she had had the new york times
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:35.280]  released the story about the emails and the further they deal and further they

[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:56.320]  and creepy sources obviously and and he's been dead on so far
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:00.240]  about so much i just don't like it actually
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:06.560]  because it makes me sick how twisted screwed up this country's gotten
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:11.920]  and to just know that we're more and more in economy based on fraud
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:16.160]  based on insider deals and then i have to read articles with goldman sacks
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:19.120]  saying capitalism's to blame when they run the whole
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:22.480]  stinking mess i mean the top of the pyramid when it comes to
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:25.440]  you know physically what we see in finances there's obviously families
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:28.160]  above that but the top of the pyramid you know the
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:32.320]  visible pyramid is goldman sacks and they're in bloomberg and
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:36.160]  everywhere else going capitalism's bad we're gonna have to rework it
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:40.160]  yeah we're gonna have to raise taxes up to 80% and give it to ourselves to make
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:44.160]  our bailouts because we're so liberal and tax exempt offshore
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:48.640]  here's bernie sanders to teach you about socialism and then we
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:53.200]  we go down to ut the night after the iowa caucus is tisdy
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:57.680]  it was on the nightly news that night but i heard it today with jacari jackson
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:00.560]  and that's he basically showed everybody you talk to and almost all of them are
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:06.240]  just like i like bernie he's gonna give me some free stuff
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:10.160]  foreigners white black they don't care everybody's the same
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.080]  they're all the same inside their brains they have become collectivists so
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:19.680]  they're just like i don't know if i'll really get free college but it'd be nice
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:24.640]  it'd be as if you're gonna get something free without trading something else
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:28.080]  you're gonna get brainwashed you're gonna get the jobs they want to give you to
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:31.280]  engineer the economy that's the military industrial complex that's the
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:34.880]  undue influence of the technological elite that control the military
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:37.920]  industrial complex to fully quote isamin
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:42.480]  is they just create this this this this fake economy
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:47.040]  like the fake derivatives black hole to just feed all the wealth and jobs and
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:50.480]  culture into it so we're all busy chasing our
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:54.480]  tails over here in la la land while they're building a lesia
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:58.960]  they've already broke away they they're laughing at us
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:02.400]  huh this is bernie sanders and i'm quite upset
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:05.680]  if you guys saw the iowa caucus the other night you would know
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:09.440]  that i worked extremely hard for these votes
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:13.600]  and the people that were working in the iowa caucus took what i worked hard for
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:19.200]  and gave it to someone else a lying cheating horrible human being by the
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:24.320]  name of hillary clinton uh and i i don't understand
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:28.640]  how anybody could like something like this that you work hard for something
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:32.960]  your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:36.800]  someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:41.280]  or more of a piece of crap than you are what kind of person would even think
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:46.320]  about something like that hey that'd be you bernie sanders

[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:30.560]  in the beginning to quote mark twain in the beginning a patriot is a scarce
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:34.560]  man hated feared and scorned but in time when his cause succeeds the timet
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:38.160]  joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:42.480]  he's outgoing senator elbert guillery of leziana a big leader in that state for
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:48.080]  a long time won't go over his whole bio elbert guillery dot com g u i l o
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:52.880]  or y will tweet out his website uh wasn't a year ago or more one of his videos
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:56.320]  went super viral tens of millions of views on different platforms
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:00.160]  and he was really one of the first to lead now what is a collapse at state and
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:04.320]  federal level of uh the people leaving of the
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:08.800]  democratic party who are elected uh and and becoming republicans
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:12.320]  and we're seeing massive losses at the house and senate level state level
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:15.520]  gubernatorial level so that's a good sign because a lot of them are more
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:21.280]  libertarian constitutional types not the more rino democrat light types we've
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:24.720]  seen like john bainer so this guy's a real leader i remember playing this at the
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:28.720]  time uh when he gave a speech but i wanted to get him on now because this is
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:32.240]  really gained steam it's a four minute video we're going to post it back to
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:35.120]  info wars dot com we'll play a few minutes of it
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:38.240]  where he gets into the democratic party i mean this is what i always grew up
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:40.880]  knowing my my grandfather came back from world war two
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:43.680]  east texas our whole family a lot of them were in politics
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:46.400]  and then they were democrats they weren't racist or anything but they were
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:49.120]  southern democrats and east texas is the south
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:52.800]  rest of texas really isn't it's about a southers you can get in east texas
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:57.760]  and uh a family kind of got upset him he was a war hero guy and all this stuff
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:01.280]  b-17 pilot whole nine yards they came back said we're going to have a civil
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:04.640]  rights movement that eisenhower and others were pushing and he ran for
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:07.680]  office and one out there and the family was kind of mad at him for a while
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:11.200]  because he was a republican now i always wondered how i got flipped to
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:15.440]  the party of the klan became the the representative of my minorities
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:20.240]  then the republicans of abraham lincoln of the civil rights act of eisenhower of
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:23.200]  my grandfather they became the racist bad guys
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:27.040]  even though growing up my grandfather was still alive i remember
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.880]  literally i mean i'm not joking at holidays and stuff
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:34.640]  upwards of 15 people showing up with pies and food black folks
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:39.760]  at our house but that's how they invert reality and it doesn't mean the
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:42.960]  republicans haven't haven't played racial politics as well but the
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:45.600]  democrats with their grand dragon senator bird
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:48.960]  it's really a sick joke and i'm not saying all democrats have that connection
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:51.920]  it's just a fact so let's play part of this clip and go to him for about 30
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:54.960]  40 minutes here and then we're going to cover news and stuff we haven't gotten
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:58.400]  to yet but let's go ahead and go to this gentleman's breakdown of why he left the
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:03.520]  democratic party after decades in it serving uh in the navy and vietnam and
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:08.400]  and in many many years in the state house and then the senate and so much more
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:12.720]  uh and uh he was also elected louisiana justice hall of fame for his work and
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:15.920]  law enforcement as well or or law and government let's go ahead and go to this
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:19.520]  clip hello my name is elbert league yellow and
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:24.640]  i'm the senator for the 24th district right here in beautiful louisiana
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:28.000]  recently i made what many are referring to as a
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.760]  bold decision to switch my party affiliation to the republican party
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:37.920]  i wanted to take a moment to explain why i chose to become a republican
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:41.840]  and also to explain why i don't think it was a bold decision at all
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:45.360]  it is the right decision not only for me
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:48.960]  but for all my brothers and sisters in the black community
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:54.320]  you see in recent history the democrat party has created the illusion that
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:59.040]  their agenda and their policies are what's best for black people
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:02.640]  somehow it's been forgotten that the republican party was founded
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:08.720]  in 1854 as an abolitionist movement with one simple creed that slavery is a
[02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:12.800]  violation of the rights of man. Frederick Douglass called republicans the
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:16.480]  party of freedom and progress and the first republican president was
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:19.680]  abraham legan the author of the emancipation
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:23.360]  proclamation it was republicans in congress who
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:28.240]  authored the 13th 14th and 15th amendments giving former slaves
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:32.320]  citizenship voting rights and new process of law
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:35.520]  the democrats on the other hand were the party of jim crow
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:38.800]  it was democrats who defended their rights of slave owners
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:42.160]  it was the republican president dwight eisenhower
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:46.560]  who championed the civil rights act of 1957
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:50.800]  but it was the democrats in the senate who filibustered the bill
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:56.560]  you see at the heart of liberalism is the idea that only a great and powerful
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:01.600]  big government can be the benefactor of social justice for all americans
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:05.200]  but the left is only concerned with one thing control
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:11.760]  and they disguise this control as charity programs such as welfare food stamps
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:15.680]  these programs are designed to lift black americans out of poverty
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:18.960]  they were always intended as a mechanism for politicians
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:22.960]  to control the black community the idea that blacks
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:27.280]  or anyone for that matter need the government to get ahead in life
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:33.680]  is despicable and even more important this idea is a failure
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:38.240]  our communities are just as poor as they have always been
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.800]  our schools continue to fail children our prisons are filled with young black
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:46.640]  men who should be at home being fathers our
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:50.400]  self-initiative and our self-reliance have been sacrificed
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:56.000]  in exchange for allegiance to our overseers who control us by making us
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.840]  dependent on them sometime i wonder if the word
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:03.840]  freedom is tossed around so frequently in our society
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:10.000]  that it has become a cliche the idea of freedom is complex and it's all
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.800]  encompassing it's the idea that the economy
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:16.960]  must remain free of government persuasion it's the idea that the press
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:20.960]  must operate without government intrusion and it's the idea that the
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:25.520]  emails and phone records of americans should remain free from government
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:30.880]  search and seizure is the idea that parents must be the decision makers
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:36.720]  in regards to their children's education not some government bureaucrat
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:42.320]  but most importantly it is the idea that the individual must be free to pursue
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:45.840]  his or her own habits free from government dependence
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:50.000]  and free from government control because to be truly free
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.840]  is to be reliant on no one other than the author
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:59.200]  of our destiny these are the ideas at the core of the republican party
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:04.480]  and it is why i am a republican so my brothers and sisters of the american
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:08.160]  community please join with me today in abandoning
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.560]  the government plantation and the party of disappointment
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:16.480]  so that we may all echo the words of one republican leader
[02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:24.320]  who famously said free at last free at last thank god almighty
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:31.200]  we are free at last that's elbert gallery senator and
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:35.200]  whether he was successful politically doing that or not the numbers nationwide
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:39.280]  and the movement that he helped start is huge
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:43.920]  and it's so sad to see the university of oregon this was mainstream news last
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:46.960]  week trying to pull down part of martin luther king's famous
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:49.520]  speech about children of all colors coming together
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:54.080]  they said well you didn't have trans transsexuals in there so he's racist
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:57.600]  this is the craziness of political correctness now just bondage
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:00.400]  over people's minds and the outgoing senator elbert
[02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:03.760]  gallery joins us elbert gallery dot com that's probably the most
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:08.320]  powerful four minutes on the subject of what the democratic party
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:13.440]  was is and continues to be and so i really appreciate him coming on and for
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:16.480]  his leadership with what he's been doing not just in louisiana but all of the
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:18.560]  country thank you sir
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:23.600]  alexis is a great uh a great honor to be here with you
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:26.560]  let's get back to why you decided to do this where it's going
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:30.880]  what you've gone through now in your state and where you see this going
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:34.400]  well i'm right for the united states congress right now the fourth district
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:38.480]  of louisiana i think that america's that are crossroads
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:43.120]  we can either go up to the top of the mountain that that mountain top that
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:46.640]  king talked about the top of the hill that reagan talked about
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:50.080]  or we can go down into the valley of history and
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:54.480]  we who are alive today have a great responsibility
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:59.200]  to make sure that this country gets to the top of that mountain
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:02.560]  and i should have added you're going from senator we've been very successful
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:06.880]  uh to to to congress and let's talk about how we get you into congress that
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:11.360]  would be awesome i'd love to see you giving speeches on television
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:15.520]  well we are trying to get a couple of things
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:18.960]  we'd like to have your prayers of course if you have advice please
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:22.720]  send that advice to us at elbertgillery.com
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:26.960]  and of course the fuel for these machines these political machines is
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:30.800]  always a little money so a two dollar
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:35.520]  donation a five dollar donation whatever you can afford if you believe in the
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:39.200]  message that i deliver and the message that i am
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:43.680]  going to take to washington dc and if you want to hear more of that message
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:47.600]  elbertgillery.com or my facebook and you will
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:51.120]  see what i'm really about well i tell you i mean you could be an even bigger
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:56.160]  leader than ron paul in congress or so informed so elegant i don't think i've
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:59.520]  heard anybody speak as good as you and i've seen a lot of your other speeches
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:02.960]  i mean you just would blow people away on c span your leadership
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:05.920]  uh when i saw this i was thinking man this guy ought to run for congress and
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:10.880]  of course i knew you were uh but it is a bold move especially in your state
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:13.840]  obviously but there is this republican landslide it looks like
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:17.600]  coming anything but election fraud i think and and you know big money maybe
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:21.040]  that can stop you but what are your chances currently right now and again
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:25.120]  what do we do to supercharge your campaign nationwide
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:30.000]  if you can help get the word out that that we really do have a message to
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.040]  deliver and that that message is delivered
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:40.160]  in a godly fashion uh and and with uh experience i've been involved in
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:47.360]  government and law 44 years so i've been around this game
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:50.720]  i understand how it is supposed to be played
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:54.560]  and how it should be played with integrity it's all about service
[02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:59.840]  about serving god and serving his people wow i tell you the system is scared of
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:03.200]  you obviously um let's talk about what happened when you
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:07.520]  made your switch when you did that and what's happened since then as a model
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:11.440]  for others because regardless whether you win lose or draw i mean i have to
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:14.160]  say you're one of the first people in the last few years to make the switch
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:19.840]  and it does seem to be a tidal wave now it has become a tsunami uh there's
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:26.160]  that's moving across this country we the democrat party has just moved so far to
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:31.120]  the left moved so far from the the values of basic
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:35.360]  americans so far from the voice of basic americans
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:38.800]  that uh we're just not satisfied we have to do something different
[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:44.800]  and what is closest to our values is the the republican party
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:49.040]  they believe in god and in country and in guns
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:54.000]  and in uh and i mean responsible of course right to defense
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:58.320]  yes we we have a right to defend ourselves and our families
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:05.920]  so those those values are just crucial to us life of course
[02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:08.880]  well obviously a lot of folks could stand the democratic party and say i'm
[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:11.920]  going to change it from within and and you know that makes sense at some levels
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:15.760]  but at a certain point yeah i mean bernie sanders could be the nominee i
[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:20.960]  mean hillary all of her corruption i mean this this party really has
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:25.200]  degenerated how can you change that from within
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:28.960]  a party headed by by bernie or hillary
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:33.120]  how can you change that from within i don't i don't see that that's possible
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:38.400]  i've had to move away from that party and i tried i was in there for i was a
[02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:45.040]  conservative democrat for a long time and i i tried moving things forward in a
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:48.640]  positive way but that simply did not work i couldn't take it
[02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:53.840]  i got a phone call one day my uh my my mother who was 103 at the time i was
[02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:59.120]  sitting on the senate floor and the head of the democrat party in
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:05.040]  Louisiana had said some racist thing about if uh if if anyone did not like
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:09.040]  obama care the only reason they wouldn't like it is because of his race
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:12.160]  and so my mom was a democrat called and said elbert
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:15.680]  you aren't you didn't say this did you no mama didn't
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:18.720]  you are you with those people who are saying that
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:21.760]  you just better be careful of them because i don't want you bringing
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:26.560]  dishonor onto our family i've been thinking
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:30.400]  for two years of making the move and when i got that little nudge
[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:33.520]  from my dear mother i had to make that switch
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:37.280]  immediately i hung up the phone and called my registrar
[02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:40.640]  so it was the democratic party in the msnbc propaganda
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:43.680]  trying to claim your racist it's like trying to take martin Luther king down
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:47.360]  you know the democrats now in some areas because he said judge people by the way
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:50.320]  they act what they do they're the character of their deeds like christ
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:53.680]  said judge a tree by its fruits and that goes diametrically opposed to what
[02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:57.200]  they teach now the opposite of martin Luther king the opposite of christ
[02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:00.240]  they just say no matter what somebody does as long as what group they're in
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:04.560]  that is gang mentality that is it's sick
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:08.240]  it is it is a sickness that we need to cure
[02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:12.080]  in america that drudge here in the studio
[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:15.920]  said america is sick and they criticize him for saying he's not attacking america
[02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:19.760]  america is sick i mean you you get sick because your body's
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:23.040]  in trouble it's telling you lay down you know dude
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:27.200]  i mean we're gonna die as a country if we don't get better
[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:31.040]  we're getting so far from those basic values that brought us
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:34.640]  to greatness as a nation like like hard work
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:40.560]  america is based on hard work it's one of the hallmarks of america
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:45.840]  now we have government programs that will if deprive a person of the their
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:51.600]  dignity of their their right to to to climb the ladder of
[02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:54.720]  success in america and to to lift their families
[02:22:54.720 --> 02:23:00.960]  to be deprived of that opportunity is is so destructive it's so sick
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:06.480]  we've got to do better america must do better
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:10.000]  again if i tried to chronicle all the state senators and state reps and even
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.080]  people in congress and folks switching to republican it would take all day but
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:19.040]  what do you expect them to do try to block yourself getting into congress
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:22.880]  and so many other people making the elite from state level to federal level
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:25.840]  where it's so badly needed because obviously they must be scared of your
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:29.120]  leadership i mean i mean imagine not just to change the democrats but
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:33.040]  republicans need some changing as well obviously from within side
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:36.240]  what are some of the tricks they're engaged in
[02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:40.640]  what is most important that you want to impart to the audience today
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:43.920]  well there's a lot of voter fraud that we have to be careful
[02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:50.960]  to be watchful about but the dirty tricks the lies the slanderous
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:55.200]  stories that they make up those are the things
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:24:01.280]  that we must watch most closely the the democrat party is as well versed in
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:05.280]  in dirty tricks and so we have to watch out for those
[02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:10.080]  if people will will help protect me from that
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:13.760]  i would appreciate it very much and i believe that our message will love
[02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:18.240]  will get a wider audience as a result of that well they're definitely scared of
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:21.600]  the message you're putting out because it's so true again with this election
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:24.480]  coming up what are the numbers looking like currently
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:28.560]  for you in louisiana to get into the u.s congress
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:32.880]  we've done several polls and they said they look very good
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:36.000]  right now i'm the only candidate announced
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:40.160]  in the fourth congressional district i'm sure that there will be others who
[02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:42.800]  will line up i'm sure that the democrats will
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:47.440]  will run two or three folks i'm sure that they'll find at least one black
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:50.640]  democrat so that they can attempt to water down
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:55.360]  my my the popularity of my vote in the black community
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:59.440]  but we are going to fight that when i lose
[02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:04.000]  the message is so important it is so important to remind americans that we
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:08.800]  are at the crossroads and that we have an obligation to protect our land
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:13.600]  our our country uh that message is going to get out
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:15.840]  well senator guillery what you said is so key
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:19.600]  losing is not taking the field losing is waiting for somebody else to do it
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:22.640]  losing is saying well i may not win so i'm not going to get in
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:25.760]  winning winning is all about resistance when you have the right
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:28.800]  message and what you're doing is winning you're a winner
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:32.000]  regardless and other people need to follow suit
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.760]  and the polls certainly indicate that we have an excellent chance of
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:41.280]  of winning we are very happy about that we're raising money
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:45.360]  for change and we're doing very well we have
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:49.280]  a national organization that's that's raising money for us
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:53.120]  and we have several individuals in different states who are helping us
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:57.280]  raise money so the the money is coming in we will
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:00.480]  at the the right time we'll have a watch yes that will
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:05.920]  permit us to go on television and radio and do all of those things but until
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:08.720]  then well that's what i tell my viewers every day
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:14.240]  is you know the ms nbc npr they take your money they get taxpayer money
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:19.360]  stimulus money over at nbc and then these big rich groups that
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:22.480]  they're criticized like when we sell books or videos to fund our show
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:26.640]  like we're bad we actually fund our own operation with stuff that people need
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:29.600]  and free association and it gets back to political
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:32.560]  campaigns of patriots like mr. guillery senator guillery
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:36.480]  this is a war folks okay all these multinationals are in here buying our
[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:39.120]  country up you got to spend money and time to
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:42.080]  protect yourself you've got to get involved and fight
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:45.840]  just like i did 25 years ago because they were trying to pass gun bans in texas
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:49.360]  i never intended to be on talk radio i didn't want to do all this i had to do it
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:54.240]  and and and they say that necessity is the mother of invention
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:58.080]  we will beat the collectivist and and the mafia and the criminals and the
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:01.440]  crony capitalist but it's going to take people getting angry
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:05.440]  and that's why we have folks on like mr. guillery because when loser draw
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:09.600]  laying down is losing period so whether you have zero money and spread the
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:12.960]  word about this gentleman and others or or whether you run for office yourself
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:16.880]  or whether you send him a hundred dollars taking action is when we win
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:21.280]  and that's why we're doing this go ahead sir you are so correct
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:26.720]  your battle in east texas is is our battle across this nation today
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:30.480]  just as you had to fight it 20 years ago today we must fight it
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:34.240]  and and we don't have a choice our backs are
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:40.720]  absolutely against the wall we must win this if we do not win this battle
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:44.000]  this year at this turning point in american history
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.800]  we will go down into the valley and we cannot afford that i owe it to my
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:52.720]  grandchild my grandson you owe it to yours
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:57.280]  we all owe it 50 years from now we must tell our grandchildren
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:02.720]  that we were the heroes you and you and you and i were the heroes
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:07.360]  who turned america around and saved our great nation
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:12.080]  in 2016 i feel so sorry for because republicans
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:15.200]  aren't perfect their constituents aren't perfect they got a lot of problems
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:19.440]  but we go down to ut and and we also have correspondents in california to talk to
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:22.960]  folks and i mean you talk to 10 people and they say arrest all gun owners and
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:25.920]  put them in jail and then all 10 you talk to say it or nine out of 10
[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:29.680]  you go down to ut and nine out of 10 say i want burning i want free stuff
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:32.240]  and you're just looking at them and they just don't get it that's not how the
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:37.520]  world works it's they're so sad it's just they're so sad
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:41.520]  it absolutely is if we don't get off our dust
[02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:46.160]  and get our own and that's what america is about it's land of opportunity
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:50.480]  it's it's the one place on earth where you can be anything that you want
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:54.080]  you can become anything as rich as you'd like to
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:57.600]  it's not about getting angry with someone else because they have more money
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:00.880]  than you have it's this is the place where you get off your duff
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:06.960]  and work and earn yours but now it's not like that because they take so much and
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:09.840]  select interest or exempt like hope from obama care
[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:13.280]  and general electric from the obama taxes on coal plants that he just lets them
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:15.280]  out of that people don't get hey the free market
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:18.480]  didn't work in like it used to i'm not getting ahead when i work hard as like
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:21.200]  i used to that's because it's rigged folks
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:24.240]  we're gonna come back with a few more minutes with state senator elbert
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:28.080]  guillery elbert guillery dot com and give him the floor because
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:30.960]  i've asked a bunch of questions i want to let him talk six seven minutes and
[02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:33.680]  really say to you what he thinks the most important but i tell you
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:36.800]  you know the breaking down the history of the democratic party and what it's
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:39.600]  really done and all the rest of it i mean if you want to say which
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:42.960]  party is the nastiest and the and the sneakiest
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:46.240]  and then the most evil overall it's got to be the democrats folks i mean they
[02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:51.680]  really are right we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:58.560]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:01.920]  i can't believe bill clinton has a nerve to campaign for hillary

[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:21.600]  you're mad at bill clinton for campaigning for his wife but you're

[02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:27.440]  dime Benghazi you're not mad at the fact that there is a person who's being
[02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:31.680]  investigated by the fbi running for president and guess what she helped
[02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:34.880]  cover up what bill did to you but you're okay with her running but you're not
[02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:38.240]  okay with him being there that makes a lot of sense i can't

[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:04.640]  certain point just gets just gets crazy and that's what the system's done is
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:07.440]  just absolutely turn the world on its head
[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:11.040]  elbert guillery dot com is the state senator's website
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:14.400]  he's running for congress and he's the only guy running the spot
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:17.760]  doing very very well but he needs your support because the system's going to
[02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:21.440]  come after him and the reason we have him on is he's one of the trailblazers
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:25.120]  i don't remember was it a year and a half ago i forget time flies uh that he
[02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:28.640]  left the democratic party in louisiana a bold move
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:32.480]  but he's done it and he really points out the real history of democratic party
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:35.840]  sir thank you for your time i've been asking the questions as i said
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:38.640]  uh what else about the democratic party would you want to say what else about
[02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:42.080]  the election who you're liking where you think it's going
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:46.880]  uh other key points you'd like to impart sir
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:52.160]  the biggest point that i'd like to make is that this nation
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:35:00.320]  sprang from the rock of of values is american values that got us this far
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:05.200]  and american values that will take us beyond
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:09.200]  into the future i'll give you a couple of examples
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:14.400]  spending this nation is now 19 trillion dollars in debt
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:18.880]  this administration and i would i'm i'm i'm angry about it and i'm angry about
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:21.760]  the debt that's going to be left to my grandchild
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:25.440]  but i wouldn't be quite so angry about it if it were not
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:28.960]  for the fact that much of it is being spent in foreign countries
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:33.120]  this president does not spend that money here
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:37.440]  this he's spending money building roads and bridges and
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:41.040]  and just shoring up infrastructure in foreign nations
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:45.600]  while our roads and bridges crumble our our infrastructure crumbles
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:50.880]  that's that's foolish people in foreign workers in foreign nations are being
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:54.480]  employed they're supporting their families while
[02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:59.360]  our unemployment rate is out of the roof uh
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:02.800]  spending is is is a major problem that we have
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:08.160]  the failed foreign policy we are less safe at home
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:12.000]  and american interests and american lives are less safe
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:20.240]  as we are in in foreign countries that is is not good for us at all
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:27.920]  the the gun situation this president wants us he wants me to have a little
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:34.160]  gun that goes pop pop pop while the guns of the criminals
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:38.560]  and the guns of the terrorists go boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:44.480]  that is a simplification but a very accurate simplification
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:49.040]  of what this administration wants when it comes to gun ownership
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:52.960]  we cannot afford that and prayer of course
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:58.800]  this nation was was based on prayer god got us here
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:03.200]  and god will get us to the mountaintop we just
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:08.080]  we have to become a prayerful nation again we cannot let these people come
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:11.920]  outsiders come into our house into god's house and say
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:16.720]  you cannot pray anymore we are americans this is america this is our nation
[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:20.160]  we can pray anywhere and anytime that we want to
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:25.840]  we must become a nation of prayer again prayer in schools prayer in courthouses
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:30.320]  prayer in our homes and prayer in our hearts and and of course life
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:34.480]  we must give some serious attention to what is happening
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:38.640]  in life you know it's it's interesting liberals
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:42.880]  work very hard to protect the lives of criminals who've committed
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:48.400]  murder and and major crimes they want mercy for them
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:55.840]  yet those same people will deny life to millions of little americans
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:01.680]  through abortion every year it's difficult for their bullies yes they
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:07.520]  are america must choose life
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:10.480]  well you're totally right and just interjects
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:14.160]  i mean look i was never a worse for the republicans they do a lot of bad things
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:17.440]  you know there's good and bad there but and i've been a christian my whole life
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:21.040]  and i've never been an unbeliever but you know you might be 20 years old you
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:23.760]  doubt sometimes but you have experiences in your life
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:27.360]  and you see god come through in providence but you also see evil in
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:30.720]  people where they'll go a hundred miles to do evil
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:35.200]  instead of walking five feet to do good they'll do bad because it's their nature
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:38.320]  even though it would be better for them not to
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:42.400]  and just the way they attack real christians and are pulling down the
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:45.280]  symbols and demonizing and then bringing in radical
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:48.960]  muslims and covering up and letting them attack and the same things done in
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:52.800]  europe it's the exact same policy and it's they may actually say it
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:57.280]  we hate christianity we hate the west we want to replace it with anything we
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:02.480]  can there is a real hatred for prosperity and goodness
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:07.200]  and i can only describe these people that actually run things as devils
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:10.960]  i would add one thing to that their attitudes toward women
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:15.600]  toward women it's not acceptable i have sisters i have daughters
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:20.000]  uh the the attitudes of some of the immigrants
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.120]  toward women like in germany the other day when those
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:30.480]  collide men were grabbing and raping german women
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:33.920]  that is not acceptable we cannot permit people
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:38.720]  like that to come into our country that's foolish exactly so why does the left
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:42.880]  relish doing it and then obama tells 30-something governor somebody gonna
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:45.840]  tell you who we're bringing in they land them in new york don't even check
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:48.720]  their ids that's on the news but then we're supposed to jump through all
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:52.400]  these hoops now the nsa spying on us when it's supposed to be spying on
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:58.800]  overseas unbelievable absolutely unbelievable
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:05.920]  only a nut would invite one sworn enemy to come into one's house
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:09.360]  you would not do that at your house i would not do it at mine
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:15.280]  yet the leader of this country goes far out of his way to invite sure
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:19.600]  who are sworn enemies sure i've had i've actually had my sworn enemies as a
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:23.280]  public figure show up at my house floor when i got kids and i'm not a calrad
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:26.720]  but i do it smart i close and lock the gate i turn the lights off
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:30.880]  and i tell the kids you go right in here and i and i get out you know what
[02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:35.520]  because people are just crazy open up your doors come on in and then cover up
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:39.520]  what they're doing what do you think the end game is
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:44.160]  we've got to change it if we continue we're going down into the the the valley
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:49.440]  of history we must stop you and i and every
[02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:56.160]  right-thinking law-abiding american must take action we must go to war for our
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:59.360]  nation that's it it is a war and and and they know it's a war and i'll never
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:02.960]  forget msnbc multiple hosts we put a tape together you know like three
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:06.800]  minutes of it a bunch of their hosts when it came out that the irs and targeted
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:11.520]  tens of thousands of 501c christian conservative libertarian
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:15.360]  law enforcement you know conservative law enforcement groups
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:20.320]  patriot groups christian groups and and and some of them they audited some of
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:24.880]  them they arrested harassed took their 501c three away and then they went on
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:28.480]  msnbc and said these are racist tea party people these are racist
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:32.000]  republicans they deserve it just broad brush like they
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:35.600]  called you a racist broad brush all these tens of thousands of people
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:39.200]  deserve to be persecuted way beyond anything nixon ever dreamed of with the
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:42.400]  irs because you're bad it's like hitler saying
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:45.680]  you're jewish so i can kill everybody because i say you're criminals
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:50.640]  it is such authoritarianism to see them do that senator
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:53.920]  one of the things that i love most about being black
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:59.040]  is that not many people can call me a racist i can tell the truth about the
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:03.680]  president about this administration and what's a few do
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:08.240]  just a few but rarely do i get called a racist
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:12.480]  i love it well i tell you uh uh the racists that have been in there couldn't
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:15.760]  do what he's done doubled on black unemployment what do you think barack
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:18.960]  obama really thinks about the general public because he's gone to africa and
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:22.560]  said you can't have air conditioning in cars that's a real quote as he's on a
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:26.880]  red carpet as if prosperity is bad and he tells poor americans of all
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:29.920]  racing colors you know i'm going to help you out but things get worse what do you
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:34.960]  think his end game is i think that if you take his
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:37.920]  policies to their logical conclusion we will no
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:42.160]  longer have a united states of america it's it's clear
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:49.360]  that it's either a lack of of understanding of how
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:56.640]  history and and nations work or a desire to to pull america down whatever it is
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:02.080]  whichever it is we must stop it we the american warriors
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:05.600]  must stop it and that's why instead of being at my house
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:10.800]  at this stage in my life i can retire and go home and sit in a rocking chair play
[02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:16.000]  with my grand babies but i must be on the battlefield
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:19.680]  because i owe it to my grand babies to leave
[02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:23.680]  the american nation that i was born into that's right
[02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:26.800]  that's right i'm very i'm very very proud of the demographics of the shows we
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:30.320]  can look on google and see exactly who listens who comes all the rest of it
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:32.720]  it's much better than looking at arbitrarian ratings and radio
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:36.720]  that gets you an idea but we are about 80 percent men
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:38.880]  it's great that we have women listening as well but if you look at the
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:44.160]  demographics it's men of every race color and creed but they are middle class
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:47.920]  and they're politically involved and and and they're super voters google even
[02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:51.280]  has the numbers to show that our audience is the people the system is
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:55.760]  deathly afraid of men that are motivated who don't want to be slaves
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:58.480]  highly motivated people that love liberty christians
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:02.080]  that threatens the system and the the answer on question
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:05.680]  the why house and the and the socialists before obama
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:09.040]  have said we want clowered and pivot we want to bankrupt the economy
[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:12.560]  everybody depended on us pushed socialism so far it bankrupts the
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:16.000]  country to go into full communism and that's what they want
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:19.360]  with rich elites offshore that administer the communism and are tax
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.760]  exempt you will know the system that's it
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:29.440]  we the warriors must stop it we must put an end
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:34.720]  to this war against our values and against our nation
[02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:38.560]  and the time is now we can't absolutely well if folks want to contact you and
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:41.680]  buy some signs or you can probably give them to them but people should buy them
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:44.560]  bumper stickers whatever folks especially we have a lot of listeners in
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:47.680]  Louisiana have a couple affiliates there if folks want to get in touch with you
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:51.680]  the best way is elbert guillery dot com senator elbert guillery

[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:32.800]  we could get him on the show because i remember a year or so ago in that video
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:35.920]  or two years ago time flies came out i remember playing it and it was so
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:39.120]  important uh and and of course i was talking a lot
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:42.160]  about you know grandpa and stuff that was actually i was even around then i
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:44.800]  was thought i remember you know saying talking about it 20 something years ago
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:48.000]  learning about it from my dad and people about
[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:54.400]  you know in the late 50s and in early 60s uh my grandfather his his dad
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:58.240]  switching over the republican party and running for office and winning
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:02.240]  in that big uh eisenhower landslide and how
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:06.160]  upset some folks were with him just because hey you don't do that
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:08.960]  because the family wasn't racist but you know you don't leave the democratic
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:11.840]  party because you know the republicans are the ones that
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:16.000]  sacked you know east texas and you know burned down our hotel and
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:19.520]  in tig texas and all the rest of it uh during reconstruction
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:24.960]  but he said listen this is uh this is uh this is 1958 or whatever it is and
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:29.840]  yeah i'm not going along with this uh so that's what it comes down to and then
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:32.320]  you've got this gentleman fighting inside the democratic party
[02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:36.640]  trying to change it from within and realizing you just can't do it
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:40.400]  and and he's not a guy i like because he's criticizing the nsa spying
[02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:43.040]  that's the republicans as well the republican leadership is just as bad
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:46.080]  as democratic leadership the difference is
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:49.360]  the democrats on the ground are the people running the show
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:52.400]  and they're the ones with forced inoculations and they're the ones saying
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:56.960]  my kids don't belong to me and and and they're just a cult of scum
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:00.480]  let's kill that jacari jackson report if we can i rarely hear reports twice in
[02:47:00.480 --> 02:47:04.160]  one day but this one really does tell it all and this is
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:07.360]  pretty much everybody talked to i mean that's what we do with these we go out
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:10.800]  and talk to like 10 15 people and then we just come show it to you unless they
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:14.080]  just refuse to talk to us sometimes we even show that
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:17.600]  we're not cherry picking this people think mark dies to cherry picking we've
[02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:21.520]  been out to california twice and gotten the the same sickening results at the
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:26.000]  same public areas he gets and he's gone to universities he's gone to other areas
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:30.080]  and i mean nine out of ten say let's put gun owners in forced labor camps
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:34.560]  nine out of ten say let's let's you know let's elect hillary's vice president
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:39.040]  carl marx you saw that just two days ago drudge report dot com link to it
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:42.640]  these people mean business they're dangerous let's go to that report to
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:47.680]  look at from that eloquent super smart historian awesome grandpa
[02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:52.400]  korean you know vet combat vet or no vietnam combat vet
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:58.080]  versus these people and it's not even their genetics or what color they are
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:01.920]  because they're all shapes and colors and it's that they they got the brain cells
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:06.080]  they just are jellyfish they weren't on a gunboat in
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:08.800]  vietnam they didn't raise a bunch of kids they didn't
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:11.760]  own companies they didn't start stuff from nothing like this guy
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:15.600]  they just sit around and watch tv and yeah that sounds good burning give me
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:18.480]  something i'm already sitting here you know with a bunch of student debt that's
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:20.960]  a scam the same system that screwed you over is never
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:24.480]  going to give you anything free let's go to this report last night we saw the
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:28.720]  results of the iowa caucus where ted Cruz donald trump and marco rubio
[02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:32.080]  came in first second and third respectively on the democratic side we
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:36.240]  saw mrs clinton have a very narrow and many people say debated victory
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:39.200]  over bernie sanders so we're here at the university of texas we're going to
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:42.960]  find out which of the candidates are best for the people here
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:45.520]  hey how you doing sir we're asking people who their favorite presidential
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:49.920]  candidate is uh bernie sanders right now yes probably
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:54.880]  with hilly clinton or rubio rubio any particular reasons why i want
[02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:58.560]  someone more towards the center bernie sanders for sure probably
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:02.000]  okay so you're feeling the burn uh any particular reason probably as a student
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:05.920]  all of this policy is about um tuition free college i don't know if it'll be
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:09.520]  possible but it works for me who would pay for the free
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:13.360]  tuition hopefully the rich people of america
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:16.320]  how's he going to pay for all the free stuff that he's
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:20.720]  suggesting he's going to give i think you know he's going to try like you know
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:24.720]  obviously you know uh use tax money to pay for it
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:30.640]  not donald trump why not the donald i just think he's like
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:35.520]  not um as involved in politics as he should be in order to be our president
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:42.240]  i feel like he's too business minded uh bernie sanders any particular reason
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:48.080]  uh no i don't really follow politics really i just uh
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:51.680]  rewind this back okay you mean you look at this guy
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:55.440]  i don't care if they're asian black white whatever they it's the same
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:50:00.560]  zombo look and you want to know why george soros is pushing marijuana and
[02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:04.880]  again i want to be clear i'm against the drug war i'm for
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:08.640]  decriminalization i do not support the drug war because it corrupts the police
[02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:12.240]  the local governments they got rid of it after prohibition of alcohol they did
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:15.920]  something new that's when drug use exploded because certain
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:19.040]  organized crime groups sort of bringing drugs in now the big banks run it all
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:24.000]  and that's all come out el chapo cia chicago tribune i mean it's a fact
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.800]  so when i do get pulled over every once in a while that hadn't happened in
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:30.320]  probably a decade and the cop says what's in your car mind if i search i go
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:32.560]  look
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:37.600]  there is a gun under the seat my second moment right i hostate law
[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:41.280]  there's no drugs there's nothing in here they start pushing i go go get a drug
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:44.000]  dog i don't use the government's products you know the government brings the
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:48.480]  drugs in now knock it off and i've never really had a problem one
[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:51.360]  time i got a drug dog like 20 years ago
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:55.040]  and a stupid fat dog was like alerting all the place and hopping around as it
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:57.360]  learned to biscuit of course no drugs were in the car
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:01.440]  but it's a giant fraud that said i'm against the drug war
[02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:05.760]  but the new marijuana is weaponized and is so strong
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:08.720]  that that people that smoke it on a routine basis especially if you're not
[02:51:08.720 --> 02:51:13.680]  highly motivated it will ruin your life you have a right to do it by the way
[02:51:13.680 --> 02:51:17.120]  there's a reason george soros is pushing it and now it's been genetically
[02:51:17.120 --> 02:51:20.080]  modified in many cases they haven't told the public that
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:23.200]  now i want to be clear if you're a type a personality and super successful and
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:26.560]  already really aggressive marijuana shows in studies even the really strong
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:30.160]  stuff used responsibly is a lot better than alcohol to keep it from
[02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:33.280]  stressing out and it'll keep you from having heart attacks you name it
[02:51:33.280 --> 02:51:36.640]  it's much better than prozac and double blind studies for depression
[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:40.880]  it's got a glaucoma hundreds of incredible usage
[02:51:40.880 --> 02:51:45.920]  it's an amazing plan but it is being abused and is dangerous and bad and i'm
[02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:49.840]  not saying this poor young man with zits all over his face it
[02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:55.840]  looks like a zombie smoked a big bowl about an hour before class
[02:51:55.840 --> 02:51:59.760]  but i'm saying he looks like people i've seen that have
[02:51:59.760 --> 02:52:05.440]  okay and and and so that added to the people having no life experience
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:08.720]  everything paid for by their parents they've now been signed on to this huge
[02:52:08.720 --> 02:52:12.320]  student debt to get jobs that won't exist
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:15.200]  i mean i'll take that back college is more competitive than ever because they
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:18.720]  send more people there so you're competing for less jobs
[02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:24.000]  you got about a 10 shot i really ever get your money back with that degree
[02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.560]  and you go get the liberal arts education all that know if you get an
[02:52:26.560 --> 02:52:29.760]  engineering degree a law degree you might have some future
[02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:33.120]  and if you know how to be charming and make straight a's then you're going
[02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:35.360]  somewhere
[02:52:35.920 --> 02:52:40.480]  i mean i do i really need to tell college people how to get ahead
[02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:43.760]  i mean it's not about the grades at the end the final equation that's why i got
[02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:46.720]  out of it it's about going to the events and
[02:52:46.720 --> 02:52:49.360]  i mean just like in caddy shack where he goes and hangs out with judge
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:53.200]  smells and goes in moses lawn and then you know gets in the shower with his
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:56.480]  wife it goes a little bit beyond that like getting in bed with judge smells
[02:52:56.480 --> 02:52:59.440]  okay so you know all people just think they're
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:03.360]  lazy they go uh berry sanders give me something free
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:08.640]  uh do you think the system needs you or wants you
[02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:13.680]  they just need you to think you're part of the game see a rollover to die
[02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:16.400]  you know i like socialism you're just a right winger
[02:53:16.400 --> 02:53:21.360]  you're dumb i'm highly educated i have three degrees that are worthless
[02:53:21.360 --> 02:53:26.480]  i can go get seven degrees if i wanted to my dad was so high in his class they
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:30.160]  just gave him one of his degrees i'm not bragging or anything that's just what
[02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:34.000]  happened oh you didn't know at that at certain
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:37.680]  levels you just oh you can leave in a year early here just have your degree
[02:53:37.680 --> 02:53:43.280]  here let's let's go ahead now and go back to the moron crew here it is
[02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:47.200]  uh bernie sanders any particular reason
[02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:54.240]  uh no i don't really follow politics really i just uh just don't like donald
[02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:59.600]  trump or uh hillary clinton
[02:53:59.600 --> 02:54:02.640]  ain't doing this we're back in our favorite presidential candidate let's
[02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:05.680]  back it up again and back to that moron because let's get all this strength i
[02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:09.120]  want to cue up big where he talks to the trendy ladies that say oh girl power
[02:54:09.120 --> 02:54:13.840]  girl power same shame shame be asked different you know what
[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:18.160]  same horse winner different you know different uh place it came from
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:20.560]  but at least he gets hillary's back because everybody's sick of the
[02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:24.240]  establishment she radiates evil do you really believe she beat bernie
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:27.520]  sanders when he'd have five ten thousand people per speech in iowa and she'd
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:31.600]  have five hundred do you believe she got more than 15 percent of the vote
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:39.040]  from hardcore man hating weirdo women loser women all she gets is loser women
[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:43.440]  votes okay i don't know saying women are losers i mean i mean
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:47.200]  maybe a third of women are screwballs whose identities hating men and hating
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:51.280]  everybody because they're losers in identity politics
[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:55.040]  that's all hillary gets his screwballs or elitists that are making money
[02:54:55.040 --> 02:54:59.120]  off the gravy train let's go back to chicari's report
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:03.040]  uh bernie sanders any particular reason
[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:07.600]  uh no i don't really follow politics really i just
[02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:13.200]  oh man just don't like donald trump brains
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:17.120]  hillary clinton hey don't mess with the people who their favorite
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:20.240]  presidential candidate is uh hillary hillary
[02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:24.160]  hillary makes me feel powerful uh she's a female and
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:30.400]  i don't know not that i'm fork i feel out of all the ones that are
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:32.720]  candidates right now like she would be the most
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:35.840]  appropriate but not ideal good pause is there any particular
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:40.000]  problem we want that again 10 seconds is so important notice she knows that's
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  horrible cliched and sexist that that woman's actually not not
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:47.120]  stupid she's pretty smart but she doesn't matter because she just does what she
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:51.600]  thinks she's supposed to do she's compliant okay
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:54.800]  hillary because well she's not perfect but she's a woman
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:56:00.000]  oops i mean not that i mean uh you know
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:04.000]  let's go back to her here we go it is uh hillary hillary
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:07.920]  yeah any particular reason uh she's a female and
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:11.760]  everyone else i just i don't know not that i'm
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:16.080]  fork i feel out of all the ones that are candidates right now like she would
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:20.160]  be the most appropriate but not ideal okay is there any particular policy that
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:24.400]  you like about her um
[02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:30.080]  oh no i guess just that she's a democrat oh yeah because they're rolling on
[02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:34.560]  bernie she's a democrat no she's female so female back to the back
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:38.480]  here but that's why anything in particular would bernie i mean
[02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:43.520]  this this clear issue of the the one percent and the
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:47.600]  ability of the rich back enough i don't know where this guy came from but i
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:52.480]  bet you money he came from venezuela or another socialist
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:56.320]  run country in latin america run to the ground by oligarchs
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:00.400]  that are leftover of colonialism and then the replacement communism
[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:04.000]  and then they run from their collapsing countries and then put shea guavara
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  shirts on i bet you in fact i'm sure he's from
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:14.400]  i can just tell you he's from venezuela or one other of those communist countries
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:17.520]  that they call socialist like bernie sanders let's let's just back up to the
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:19.760]  beginning of him is this yeah i could teach a college
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:24.000]  course on these people's responses alone i mean listen capitalism gave him all
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:27.040]  the clothes he's got the iphone all of it
[02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:30.080]  guaranteed he likes the socialism he's probably getting a free education
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:32.880]  but only so he can then be put in a political position
[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:37.120]  and probably sent back to make sure venezuela stays under cia control
[02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:40.720]  because the cia documents got leaked where they said we love you go chavez
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:46.240]  we get seven times the return we get with the right where they wouldn't pay us
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:50.160]  these communists pay they go golden sacks loves communism
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:53.120]  riches company in the world because they're exempt from it
[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:56.960]  let's go back to him in particular with bernie well i mean this
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:02.960]  this clear issue of the the one percent and the the ability of the rich to
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:06.720]  become richer and i mean a better distribution of wealth in the

[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:40.400]  you know it's one of the top samurais i forget his name said
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:43.920]  can you guys find me the quote i'll read it next segment the way of the samurai
[03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:46.880]  is desperate and i remember reading that when i was a
[03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:51.760]  teenager and i grew up in a not so much a rough
[03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:54.560]  neighborhood but a rough area my parents just
[03:01:54.560 --> 03:01:57.520]  where the old school where they just let your sons fight nowadays it seems so
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:02.320]  alien in nanny state and uh i remember it clicked with me
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:05.360]  so much because i read about the vikings doing berserk and stuff and
[03:02:05.360 --> 03:02:08.400]  i'd had the opportunity to be in positions for three four five six seven
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:11.840]  eight nine ten people attack you at once and it was such a liberating feeling
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:16.880]  to turn into mr hide uh that i really understood what
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:24.160]  that samurai was saying that the the desperateness is the way of the samurai
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:27.680]  where you're not even trying anymore it's full commitment full
[03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:32.880]  will with love and hate and everything dumped out
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:36.560]  just to slash and cut your enemies into pieces
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:39.440]  not even care about what they do to you because you're gonna be too busy slicing
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:44.960]  them to bits and an offense of attack that's the only defense you've got
[03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:49.040]  and that's what it comes down to and people need to have that fighting spirit
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:55.680]  a mad dog spirit vicious armored sheepdogs just rushing into the wolves
[03:02:55.680 --> 03:02:59.360]  and just they're just biting in and not even stopping and just tearing their
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:02.880]  guts out as you go and then clamping on to the next one
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:06.160]  we don't have time to clamp onto their legs or clamp onto their you know the
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:08.720]  safer parts we gotta go right into their face and just
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:12.960]  politically grab onto the face and tear a chunk out grab right on the nose
[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:16.640]  rip it off grab right the throat and not even question whether when we pull
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:20.000]  apart our jaws gonna take their jugglers whatever
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:23.440]  that's what i'm talking about the desperateness
[03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:27.440]  the death battle because they've already killed us most of us
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:30.800]  the food the water we're walking dead we're not going to be living as long as
[03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:35.120]  our parents or grandparents know that and i hate to get so
[03:03:35.120 --> 03:03:37.280]  you know
[03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:43.040]  fatalistic about it i'm not fatalistic the way of the samurai is desperateness
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:46.880]  folks we are in a desperate situation that's why they want to drug down dumb
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:49.520]  down controlled by the mindless culture so that we're just
[03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:52.560]  narcolized with entertainment and culture and death
[03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:58.000]  where we just uh so uh humans are disease i accept we're bad uh the earth
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:02.000]  is yours i hand it over i just fall down so the
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:06.160]  Rothschilds and all this scum can just float around above us
[03:04:06.160 --> 03:04:10.000]  looting all the technology our minds developed for themselves
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  no no no no
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:22.080]  to quote emperor palpatine you will die
[03:04:22.080 --> 03:04:28.000]  but in a good way you know what i mean you scum think you'll destroy the human
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:31.200]  spirit see they're shuttering everything we've
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:34.080]  got the good the bad the ugly they want us dead
[03:04:34.080 --> 03:04:37.600]  all those instincts that god gave us that will overthrow the enemy we've got
[03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:41.200]  the smarts we've got the tricks we've got the viciousness times 10 of the
[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:43.840]  enemy all they've got evil we've got huge
[03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:48.080]  stores of good and and our evil is even bigger than theirs
[03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:52.640]  see that's the secret they know and they're scared of these are little boys
[03:04:52.640 --> 03:04:58.240]  but we don't have the hunger to dominate them is why we're their slaves
[03:04:59.600 --> 03:05:04.160]  this is barney sanders and i'm quite upset if you guys saw the iowa carcass the

[03:05:09.280 --> 03:05:13.120]  and the people that were working in the iowa carcass took what i worked hard
[03:05:13.120 --> 03:05:16.720]  for and gave it to someone else a lying
[03:05:16.720 --> 03:05:19.680]  cheating horrible human being by the name of
[03:05:19.680 --> 03:05:25.280]  hillary clinton uh and i i don't understand how anybody
[03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:28.960]  could like something like this that you work hard for something your whole
[03:05:28.960 --> 03:05:32.800]  life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to
[03:05:32.800 --> 03:05:36.640]  someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy
[03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:41.120]  or more of a piece of crap than you are what kind of person would even think
[03:05:41.120 --> 03:05:44.400]  about something like that

[03:08:26.720 --> 03:08:30.640]  i have some final key news and i'm beginning to before i hand the baton
[03:08:30.640 --> 03:08:33.200]  and think it's yarding he's got a lot to cover today
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:36.640]  but i found the samurai quote i tried to do a plug earlier got so excited again i
[03:08:36.640 --> 03:08:40.400]  couldn't physically do it uh but lord nashugi
[03:08:40.400 --> 03:08:44.880]  if i'm pronouncing that right said the way of the samurai
[03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:50.400]  is in desperateness 10 men or more cannot kill such a man
[03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:53.280]  common sense will not accomplish great things
[03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:57.520]  simply becoming insane and desperate in the way of the samurai
[03:08:57.520 --> 03:09:01.840]  if one uses discrimination he will fall behind
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:06.080]  one needs neither loyalty nor devotion but simply to become desperate in the
[03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:10.480]  way loyalty and devotion are of themselves
[03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:15.040]  within desperation that's right all these pseudo-intellectual
[03:09:15.040 --> 03:09:18.640]  things they join with evil and join with selling people out because they
[03:09:18.640 --> 03:09:23.120]  calculated how it makes them win loyalty and telling the truth and being
[03:09:23.120 --> 03:09:27.200]  honorable is the strength being willing to fail and fall for what's
[03:09:27.200 --> 03:09:30.160]  right is the strength and with it then comes the
[03:09:30.160 --> 03:09:33.600]  greater intelligence only in the desperateness do you get the
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:36.880]  higher orders and that's why you evil people
[03:09:36.880 --> 03:09:42.480]  haven't will never understand anything because you're fallen
[03:09:42.480 --> 03:09:49.360]  you're pathetic you think you're above us you have advanced knowledge of evil
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:55.680]  you're upside down you understand that you've got it flipped around
[03:09:55.680 --> 03:10:03.760]  we have knowledge of evil we don't use it because we're not like you
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:08.160]  we have knowledge of the dirty tricks and everything else
[03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:12.240]  but we don't use it because we know it comes back on us and our families
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:16.160]  and everyone else we're not foolish enough to think that we
[03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:20.080]  are invincible and above the law of god
[03:10:20.080 --> 03:10:24.400]  the law of the universe the law of common sense
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:27.760]  it's like the nuclear reactor is 90 plus percent are leaking worldwide
[03:10:27.760 --> 03:10:32.800]  it wasn't like that just 20 years ago you people think you're exempt
[03:10:32.800 --> 03:10:36.240]  you think you're in a race to find all this life extension with all your
[03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:42.240]  clones and chimeras when you're going to release the plagues that kill you
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:48.000]  in your mad scientist rush for total control
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:51.600]  the way of the samurai is in desperate of such an important quote
[03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:56.000]  ten men or more cannot kill such a man common sense will not accomplish great
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:59.600]  things simply become insane and desperate
[03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:03.440]  in the way of a samurai if one uses
[03:11:03.440 --> 03:11:07.760]  discrimination he will fall behind one needs neither loyalty nor devotion
[03:11:07.760 --> 03:11:12.400]  but simply to become desperate in the way loyalty and devotion
[03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:16.560]  are of themselves within desperation
[03:11:18.800 --> 03:11:22.320]  you're not weak because you give yourself over to doing the right thing
[03:11:22.320 --> 03:11:25.920]  and committing to it no matter what you're strong
[03:11:25.920 --> 03:11:29.840]  when you stop using twisted logic and evil
[03:11:29.840 --> 03:11:33.360]  the whole world is false when it tries to sell you
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:37.840]  false logic the political correctness i saw a brown paper bag
[03:11:37.840 --> 03:11:43.840]  the halls named lynch don't lynch me you see just it's all just
[03:11:43.840 --> 03:11:47.360]  until their false way of the logic of the world
[03:11:47.360 --> 03:11:51.120]  is your certain destruction
[03:11:51.120 --> 03:11:56.400]  the only way you'll break out of their control is to become desperate but not
[03:11:56.400 --> 03:12:00.400]  in the modern sense of desperate desperate means
[03:12:00.400 --> 03:12:05.040]  death battle desperate means the woman 60 years old picking the car up off a
[03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:12.080]  grandchild when six men couldn't do it turning off your governors
[03:12:12.880 --> 03:12:16.960]  going with your instincts then they already have all the answers
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:20.080]  they already have the calculus it's already there
[03:12:20.080 --> 03:12:24.080]  your mind already was a thousand steps ahead of the pseudo-intellectuals that
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:28.480]  thought they had all the answers when they didn't have anything
[03:12:28.880 --> 03:12:32.800]  the parasites rob the world they didn't build it
[03:12:32.800 --> 03:12:36.960]  that's why they hate the people that built the world because
[03:12:36.960 --> 03:12:41.840]  they know they stole it that's what the allegory of the body snatcher does
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:46.000]  the shape shifter it doesn't become you until it's killed you
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:51.040]  and stuffed you in a trunk and thrown you in the river
[03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:56.000]  their imposters their frauds their shadows
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:59.360]  they seek substance they seek to become gods
[03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:03.760]  they seek to have power they seek to ascend
[03:13:03.760 --> 03:13:07.440]  because they've fallen and they don't know that
[03:13:07.440 --> 03:13:12.000]  we're already with god forever we've already gone to the next level
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:16.240]  the test is do we see past it and this world
[03:13:16.240 --> 03:13:20.320]  look at the stars and oh the beautiful universe i wish i could see it you're
[03:13:20.320 --> 03:13:24.720]  on it on one of the most beautiful planets you just know there is
[03:13:24.720 --> 03:13:29.120]  look at that gas giant look at that dead planet look oh look at the
[03:13:29.120 --> 03:13:33.120]  flew a probe over a frozen planetoid wow that's really interesting
[03:13:33.120 --> 03:13:36.720]  and they just shit are going this planet so boring
[03:13:36.720 --> 03:13:40.320]  nothing's going like jets flying over computers drones everywhere
[03:13:40.320 --> 03:13:44.160]  genetic engineering all the massive factories
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:48.880]  oil operations undersea programs and then realize all the other secret stuff
[03:13:48.880 --> 03:13:52.240]  going on and oh that's all boring did you see the x-files way
[03:13:52.240 --> 03:13:55.440]  they cross humans with animals oh did you see 50 news articles that
[03:13:55.440 --> 03:13:59.600]  vinegar was going on 30 years ago and again we told you they'd start
[03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:03.200]  emerging with it when they're getting ready to roll out the next nightmare
[03:14:03.200 --> 03:14:06.960]  phase so here's the deal this is a war for
[03:14:06.960 --> 03:14:10.240]  humanity and if you won't commit to it and spread the word about the broadcast
[03:14:10.240 --> 03:14:13.280]  if you won't do banner hangs if you won't pay for billboards without me even
[03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:17.360]  asking for yourself do a radio show put your own billboard up i don't care
[03:14:17.360 --> 03:14:21.120]  if you won't buy our products if you won't spread the word if you won't pray
[03:14:21.120 --> 03:14:24.400]  for us which i know you're doing i'm talking to those that have it if you
[03:14:24.400 --> 03:14:28.480]  won't commit to something you already committed to nothing
[03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:32.000]  see even though you've not chosen you have made a choice
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:36.160]  the worst choice to be lukewarm choose a side i respect those have decided to
[03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:39.040]  serve lucifer i know who they are i know why they've
[03:14:39.040 --> 03:14:43.360]  done it those that are conscious have decided in their fear of the flesh
[03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:47.520]  they have joined out of fear most of them others have joined because they're in
[03:14:47.520 --> 03:14:51.120]  love with the darkness but most of you don't even believe in the
[03:14:51.120 --> 03:14:55.280]  devil but you still work for them and that's why you're fools
[03:14:55.280 --> 03:15:01.200]  but i will explain to you again you don't have to do it and many of you have
[03:15:01.200 --> 03:15:06.080]  not given up your soul completely there's still time to turn around
[03:15:06.080 --> 03:15:09.760]  there's still time to change the road you're on
[03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:13.120]  but you better do it now
[03:15:13.920 --> 03:15:18.240]  you better get past that fear of what will the world do to me
[03:15:18.240 --> 03:15:21.600]  what do you think that fear is it's more than just a psychic impulse it's
[03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:24.800]  it's more than just the tv and programs it's more
[03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:29.120]  what will the world do if i set my will against this you can feel that will
[03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:32.480]  don't you a will against you that you think you're part of but even when you
[03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:35.520]  say you're part of that will you know it's not really yours
[03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:39.680]  you know you've been enslaved i can't believe the cowards out there that
[03:15:39.680 --> 03:15:44.800]  feel that will that would destroy them and then they decide to serve it
[03:15:44.800 --> 03:15:48.320]  when it doesn't even let you out it can't let you out
[03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:51.360]  it's fallen

[03:17:45.360 --> 03:17:48.880]  well thanks alex that was some some really hardcore speech and actually ties
[03:17:48.880 --> 03:17:52.480]  into exactly what i was going to talk about which is the number one threat to
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:57.200]  all of humanity being corruption and people that have decided
[03:17:57.200 --> 03:18:00.960]  to join with evil i've got a bunch of articles a bunch of breaking news a
[03:18:00.960 --> 03:18:03.920]  bunch of videos we're going to premiere in special reports on this
[03:18:03.920 --> 03:18:09.680]  the remaining fourth hour but specifically i have some articles today
[03:18:09.680 --> 03:18:14.800]  about some really really disturbing things and it all ties into this one key
[03:18:14.800 --> 03:18:18.960]  thing that you've really talked about yourself the number one threat to all
[03:18:18.960 --> 03:18:22.960]  of humanity outside of natural disasters outside of the earthquakes
[03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:27.440]  outside of volcanoes you know it really comes down to people in high
[03:18:27.440 --> 03:18:30.480]  positions of power that's right crazy globalist with
[03:18:30.480 --> 03:18:33.920]  the number one threat to humanity exactly and they
[03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:37.200]  managed to get into these high positions of power because they're sociopathic
[03:18:37.200 --> 03:18:40.640]  they're aggressive they're willing to screw over other people
[03:18:40.640 --> 03:18:43.920]  that would get it otherwise i mean look at hillary clinton with the coin toss
[03:18:43.920 --> 03:18:48.400]  total ridiculousness but you have also the minions of these people
[03:18:48.400 --> 03:18:52.000]  that kind of also align with it and that's why you have those videos of
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:54.880]  people working for her doing the voter fraud
[03:18:54.880 --> 03:18:57.680]  apparently on on youtube which it does seem to be the case
[03:18:57.680 --> 03:19:01.440]  then you have people working for these people also in a trickle down system
[03:19:01.440 --> 03:19:04.720]  doing the same thing because they buy into it and it leads to this system
[03:19:04.720 --> 03:19:08.240]  i'm going to talk about it when we come back from the break where for example
[03:19:08.240 --> 03:19:11.920]  three thousand children dying a day in india because the government won't
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:15.520]  release the food supplies to the dying starving poor
[03:19:15.520 --> 03:19:19.600]  or kenya just spent a million dollars on chairs for the government
[03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:22.800]  just total ridiculousness but it's not too far from what's happening in the
[03:19:22.800 --> 03:19:26.800]  united states i mean we lost what was it eight trillion dollars has been gone
[03:19:26.800 --> 03:19:30.560]  missing i have eight point five trillion dollars the pentagon can't find
[03:19:30.560 --> 03:19:35.600]  total ridiculous it was two trillion just uh 15 years ago yep now it's 8.5
[03:19:35.600 --> 03:19:38.720]  so there are parallels and it really is the number one threat to all humanity
[03:19:38.720 --> 03:19:41.920]  i'm going to talk about that we can do about it premiere some videos and a
[03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:44.720]  lot more and breaking news on the zika virus that you don't want to miss as
[03:19:44.720 --> 03:19:48.320]  well so all right anthony great job and great job of the crew i'm punching out
[03:19:48.320 --> 03:19:52.480]  until tomorrow nightly news tonight seven o'clock central standard time
[03:19:52.480 --> 03:19:55.920]  it's time to get desperate
[03:19:58.880 --> 03:20:02.640]  what would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality
[03:20:02.640 --> 03:20:05.680]  feeling better than you have in years and you noticed a difference in your
[03:20:05.680 --> 03:20:09.040]  sleeping patterns blood sugar levels and had a sense of well-being
[03:20:09.040 --> 03:20:12.640]  overall there's something that is changing thousands of people's lives

[03:21:09.600 --> 03:21:13.600]  help children focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control

[03:24:18.160 --> 03:24:21.840]  lots of good stuff including a special report on some new discoveries
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:25.760]  in the flint events really i don't even know what else you would call it kind of
[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:29.040]  a disaster but first and foremost i wanted to
[03:24:29.040 --> 03:24:32.560]  talk to you about something that is really really important and that is in
[03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:35.680]  my view what is the number one threat to humanity
[03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:39.760]  outside of natural disasters earthquakes volcanoes you name it
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:43.680]  it really comes down to people in high positions of power
[03:24:43.680 --> 03:24:49.440]  that are both vicious and without empathy controlling things and controlling
[03:24:49.440 --> 03:24:53.360]  you i want to give you some concrete examples with articles that just came
[03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:56.320]  out today that really inspired me to put all this together
[03:24:56.320 --> 03:25:00.800]  in this segment and it's really a sad topic it's a it's a sad topic
[03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:04.640]  it's worth reflecting on and realizing it so we can do something about it
[03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:08.400]  and it also puts things into perspective where you are in your life
[03:25:08.400 --> 03:25:11.680]  so first of all it's under it's important to understand this isn't just a
[03:25:11.680 --> 03:25:14.560]  little bit of corruption a little bit of payoffs that we're going to talk about
[03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:17.600]  like a little bit of backdoor deals or something
[03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:22.080]  this is deep deep deep disturbing corruption
[03:25:22.080 --> 03:25:26.240]  to the point where as i'll talk about with one of these articles in india
[03:25:26.240 --> 03:25:30.320]  thousands of people including children are dying
[03:25:30.320 --> 03:25:34.960]  because the government and the ridiculous corporations and the bureaucracy
[03:25:34.960 --> 03:25:38.800]  won't release these storages of grain to them and just letting them are letting
[03:25:38.800 --> 03:25:42.320]  them rot and be eaten by mice and rats and just destroyed
[03:25:42.320 --> 03:25:45.600]  with fungus and bacteria we're going to get into that
[03:25:45.600 --> 03:25:48.800]  so this is a very very real threat that happens
[03:25:48.800 --> 03:25:53.840]  not only in india and throughout africa but it is happening here
[03:25:53.840 --> 03:25:57.120]  it is happening here i'm going to show that exact parallels to you
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:00.960]  so you can understand this so first of all to break it open let's talk about
[03:26:00.960 --> 03:26:03.280]  this article from the international business times
[03:26:03.280 --> 03:26:06.960]  in poverty stricken kenya corrupt government spends over one million
[03:26:06.960 --> 03:26:10.560]  dollars on shares and the reason i wanted to
[03:26:10.560 --> 03:26:14.160]  present this to you and show you this is it's really just a little bit of crack
[03:26:14.160 --> 03:26:16.560]  on the egg this is from a few years ago but it's
[03:26:16.560 --> 03:26:20.800]  a good example there are obviously we know about this corruption
[03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:23.680]  to a large degree we know that you know the kenyan government various
[03:26:23.680 --> 03:26:26.240]  governments in africa various governments throughout the world
[03:26:26.240 --> 03:26:29.520]  are totally corrupt totally ridiculous but this is a concrete example they
[03:26:29.520 --> 03:26:34.560]  actually decided that they needed to take uh they need to redo their government
[03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:38.080]  establishment so they bought a million dollars in shares
[03:26:38.080 --> 03:26:41.520]  with all these you know ridiculous dude ads on top of them obviously they're
[03:26:41.520 --> 03:26:44.720]  pocketing the money and so no it's totally fine don't worry
[03:26:44.720 --> 03:26:48.400]  about it specifically what happened was
[03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:52.080]  on monday central bank governor nijunga
[03:26:52.080 --> 03:26:57.440]  nadungu and trade master aimos lemunia were both indicted by an investigative
[03:26:57.440 --> 03:27:01.200]  parliamentary committee the two were charged with losing more than 21 million
[03:27:01.200 --> 03:27:04.960]  dollars in public funds according to east african business week so that was
[03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:08.960]  related to that they lost 21 million dollars but on a larger scale on a more
[03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:13.760]  disturbing and larger scale as crops rot millions go hungry in india
[03:27:13.760 --> 03:27:17.520]  this is from reuters and this article stuck with me i've remembered it for
[03:27:17.520 --> 03:27:22.560]  years since i read it back in 2012 every day some 3000 indian children
[03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:26.880]  die from illnesses related to malnutrition and yet countless heaps of rodent
[03:27:26.880 --> 03:27:31.120]  infested wheat and rice are rotting in fields across north of their own
[03:27:31.120 --> 03:27:35.120]  country think let that sit in for a second
[03:27:35.120 --> 03:27:38.080]  it is an extraordinary paradox created by a rigid regime
[03:27:38.080 --> 03:27:42.480]  of subsidy subsidies for grain farmers a woeful lack of storage facilities
[03:27:42.480 --> 03:27:46.080]  and an inefficient here's the key part corruption plagued
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:50.800]  public distribution system that fails millions of impoverished people
[03:27:50.800 --> 03:27:56.400]  3000 children dying every single day because of a corruption plagued public
[03:27:56.400 --> 03:27:59.840]  distribution system which means the bureaucracy and the government and all
[03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:04.560]  the craziness are just so bloated and so full of corruption
[03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:07.600]  and there's so many inside deals and there's so many regulations that they
[03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:11.920]  put into control people that they're letting 3000 children a day
[03:28:11.920 --> 03:28:18.880]  die of starvation for malnutrition per day while the grain
[03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:26.400]  sits there and rots and is eaten by rats eaten by rats they workers in this
[03:28:26.400 --> 03:28:30.080]  piece and other ones that i read is one in the new york times
[03:28:30.080 --> 03:28:33.440]  and i believe international business times go in and they say
[03:28:33.440 --> 03:28:36.800]  sometimes we hand it out to people that are just like on their knees crying and
[03:28:36.800 --> 03:28:40.000]  begging for food but it's usually just gone to waste
[03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:44.320]  that the bugs eat it or the rats eat it that is true corruption
[03:28:44.320 --> 03:28:48.560]  that is what we face as a threat throughout the world it
[03:28:48.560 --> 03:28:52.000]  can happen here it is happening here for example
[03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:55.040]  you all remember this and if you don't you should definitely
[03:28:55.040 --> 03:28:58.960]  investigate it Reuters special report from 2013
[03:28:58.960 --> 03:29:02.000]  the Pentagon the Pentagon's doctored ledgers conceal
[03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:06.480]  epic waste and it goes on to talk about how the accountants
[03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:09.520]  were fudging all these numbers because they didn't know what's going on
[03:29:09.520 --> 03:29:14.320]  and a more direct one comes from yahoo want to cut government waste
[03:29:14.320 --> 03:29:18.160]  find 8.5 trillion the pentagon can't account for
[03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:21.200]  if you thought the botched rollout of obama care the government shut down or
[03:29:21.200 --> 03:29:24.160]  the sequester represented washington dysfunction that's worse
[03:29:24.160 --> 03:29:27.840]  wait until you hear about the taxpayer waste at the defense department
[03:29:27.840 --> 03:29:33.200]  8.5 trillion and there is more we're going to cover it when we come back
[03:29:33.200 --> 03:29:36.400]  we're going to talk about martin chicrelli who raised the
[03:29:36.400 --> 03:29:40.720]  AIDS drug from $13 to 750 he's now facing prison
[03:29:40.720 --> 03:29:44.240]  and detaining women for running without burkas on
[03:29:44.240 --> 03:29:47.760]  that's ISIS for you all right we'll be right back to xanthony gucciardi

[03:30:19.200 --> 03:30:24.720]  name of hillary clinton uh and i i don't understand how
[03:30:24.720 --> 03:30:28.800]  anybody could like something like this that you work hard for something your
[03:30:28.800 --> 03:30:32.880]  whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to
[03:30:32.880 --> 03:30:36.800]  someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy
[03:30:36.800 --> 03:30:41.280]  or more of a piece of crap than you are what kind of person would even think
[03:30:41.280 --> 03:30:44.560]  about something like that

[03:33:22.640 --> 03:33:25.760]  welcome back it's the fourth hour i'm anthony goodjardy
[03:33:25.760 --> 03:33:30.800]  and we're talking about what i think is the number one threat to all of humanity
[03:33:30.800 --> 03:33:34.160]  and i say this with understanding that yes
[03:33:34.160 --> 03:33:39.280]  there could be a fisher in the earth and we could all die from an earthquake
[03:33:39.280 --> 03:33:42.160]  type scenario and yellowstone could blow up and all that kind of stuff i get
[03:33:42.160 --> 03:33:45.280]  that but i'm talking about a practical reality
[03:33:45.280 --> 03:33:49.840]  because what happens is and it is the deepest corruption that i'm talking
[03:33:49.840 --> 03:33:52.560]  about the deepest corruption of people without empathy
[03:33:52.560 --> 03:33:55.920]  and vicious people taking high positions of power
[03:33:55.920 --> 03:33:59.040]  they then trigger the things that you could also say would be
[03:33:59.040 --> 03:34:04.400]  the number one threat like a nuclear war or some type of other war scenario
[03:34:04.400 --> 03:34:08.560]  it's these people that would trigger those things so it is really the source
[03:34:08.560 --> 03:34:13.040]  of other threats like nuclear war or a bio warfare
[03:34:13.040 --> 03:34:16.880]  we're talking earlier about in india how there's
[03:34:16.880 --> 03:34:21.200]  huge food supplies of wheat and grain and stuff like that just
[03:34:21.200 --> 03:34:24.960]  sitting in these warehouses rotting being destroyed because the government is
[03:34:24.960 --> 03:34:28.400]  so corrupt it won't release it to the dying
[03:34:28.400 --> 03:34:32.560]  poor people with 3 000 children dying every single day because they can't eat
[03:34:32.560 --> 03:34:36.160]  the food we're relating it to the the corruption
[03:34:36.160 --> 03:34:40.000]  inside the united states we're talking about this piece from yahu news
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:43.200]  want to cut government waste find eight point five trillion
[03:34:43.200 --> 03:34:45.920]  the pentagon can't account for and a lot of you have probably already heard
[03:34:45.920 --> 03:34:49.840]  about this but it's such a ridiculous realization
[03:34:49.840 --> 03:34:53.840]  special enterprise reporter scott paltrow unearthed the high cost of the
[03:34:53.840 --> 03:34:57.360]  pentakons bad bookkeeping in a roiders investigation the one i told you about
[03:34:57.360 --> 03:35:00.800]  earlier it amounts to 8.5 trillion in taxpayer money
[03:35:00.800 --> 03:35:03.920]  doled out by congress to the pentagon since 1996
[03:35:03.920 --> 03:35:07.760]  that has never been accounted for the year 1996
[03:35:07.760 --> 03:35:12.000]  in parentheses by the way uh was the first of the pentagon should have
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:16.000]  been audited under a law requiring audits of all government departments
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:19.680]  but by the way the pentagon is the only federal agency that does not comply
[03:35:19.680 --> 03:35:23.520]  with this law gee i wonder why i wonder why it's almost like they're doing some
[03:35:23.520 --> 03:35:28.080]  fishy stuff you know all of this reminds me and ties into
[03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:31.600]  some of the latest developments with martin screlly
[03:35:31.600 --> 03:35:34.400]  i believe that's how you pronounce his name and actually uh an investigators
[03:35:34.400 --> 03:35:37.920]  recently asked him the same question so this is the guy
[03:35:37.920 --> 03:35:42.240]  that jacked up the cost of a prescription drug
[03:35:42.240 --> 03:35:47.840]  traditionally used by AIDS patients from 13 dollars and 50 cents to 750
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:52.160]  dollars overnight okay overnight and he was
[03:35:52.160 --> 03:35:55.680]  bashed for a long time and he just says i don't care i do whatever
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:35:59.280]  specifically this is from the new york times back in september of last year
[03:35:59.280 --> 03:36:02.640]  specialists in infectious disease are protesting a gigantic overnight
[03:36:02.640 --> 03:36:06.240]  increase in the price of a 62 year old drug that is the standard of care for
[03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:09.120]  treating a life-threatening parasitic infection
[03:36:09.120 --> 03:36:13.440]  that a lot of apparently hiv patients and AIDS patients need to use
[03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:18.400]  the drug called dara prim was acquired in august by touring pharmaceuticals a
[03:36:18.400 --> 03:36:22.000]  startup run by a former hedge fund manager touring immediately raised the
[03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:26.880]  price to 750 dollars a tablet from 1350 bringing the annual
[03:36:26.880 --> 03:36:31.520]  cost of treatment for some patients to hundreds of thousands of dollars
[03:36:31.520 --> 03:36:34.400]  so this guy martin screlly the guy that owned
[03:36:34.400 --> 03:36:37.600]  was the uh managing director whatever of touring pharmaceuticals
[03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:41.600]  was recently questioned in congress and now he's actually been arrested
[03:36:41.600 --> 03:36:45.120]  for a bunch of different things including insider trading and stuff like
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:48.160]  that and i want you to watch this video or
[03:36:48.160 --> 03:36:53.120]  listen to this video and just listen to the smugness he's smiling throughout
[03:36:53.120 --> 03:36:56.960]  again being questioned about raising the price of a prescription drugs that a
[03:36:56.960 --> 03:37:00.480]  lot of hiv slash AIDS patients use for infectious
[03:37:00.480 --> 03:37:04.640]  disease of parasitic infection from 13 dollars to 750 dollars
[03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:09.440]  here is the interrogation from congress i want to ask you to
[03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:15.600]  know i want to plead with you to use any remaining influence you have
[03:37:15.600 --> 03:37:20.640]  over your former company to press them to lower the price
[03:37:20.640 --> 03:37:27.040]  of these drugs you can look away if you like but i wish you could see the
[03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:32.320]  faces of people no matter what miss reds laugh says
[03:37:32.320 --> 03:37:36.320]  who cannot get the drugs that they need and by the way
[03:37:36.320 --> 03:37:40.000]  it's the taxpayers somebody's paying for these drugs
[03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:44.800]  somebody's paying it's the taxpayers that end up paying for some of them
[03:37:44.800 --> 03:37:48.480]  you could use that attention to come clean to right
[03:37:48.480 --> 03:37:54.000]  your wrongs and to become one of the most effective
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:58.720]  patient advocates in the country and one that can make a big difference in so
[03:37:58.720 --> 03:38:02.880]  many people's lives i know you're smiling but i'm
[03:38:02.880 --> 03:38:08.560]  very serious sir and i truly believe
[03:38:08.560 --> 03:38:14.960]  i truly believe are you listening
[03:38:14.960 --> 03:38:18.400]  yes you know that's really sad to me it really is
[03:38:18.400 --> 03:38:21.440]  i don't think i have to go too far into it it's pretty self-explanatory
[03:38:21.440 --> 03:38:25.920]  but it's really really sad to me to think you know it'd be one thing if you sat
[03:38:25.920 --> 03:38:30.320]  up there and with a with a regular not smiling maniacal
[03:38:30.320 --> 03:38:34.240]  crazy-looking face and and said something
[03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:39.680]  but to be smiling and and just really smug about the whole thing
[03:38:39.680 --> 03:38:43.200]  again martin chicrelli the guy that raised the price of a prescription drug
[03:38:43.200 --> 03:38:47.920]  that is used by a lot of hiv slash ace patients from 13 dollars to 750 dollars
[03:38:47.920 --> 03:38:50.560]  just kind of smiling about it just it looks like he's just
[03:38:50.560 --> 03:38:54.960]  getting high off of it that is really really disturbing to me and it reminds
[03:38:54.960 --> 03:38:59.120]  me of the stories we covered where the grain is being held from the
[03:38:59.120 --> 03:39:03.040]  children dying every day it's it's just very sad
[03:39:03.040 --> 03:39:05.600]  and i think it is the threat that we all face
[03:39:05.600 --> 03:39:12.800]  at a country level at a society level and it also kind of reminds me
[03:39:12.800 --> 03:39:16.880]  of various situations that we're facing around the country it always ties back
[03:39:16.880 --> 03:39:20.480]  to one two or a group of people that seem
[03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:24.960]  to have been very vicious and without empathy now i've got some other news to
[03:39:24.960 --> 03:39:28.240]  cover on the zika virus some breaking news on that where it's spread to
[03:39:28.240 --> 03:39:31.760]  and some ridiculous isis news about reportedly detaining a woman for
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:35.280]  fleeing russian airstrikes without her cover up
[03:39:35.280 --> 03:39:38.800]  and how people in mumbai cannot even see outside their window
[03:39:38.800 --> 03:39:43.440]  barely because of a week-long garbage fire some some totally crazy stuff but
[03:39:43.440 --> 03:39:47.040]  first i wanted to play a special report by john bound i think it kind of ties
[03:39:47.040 --> 03:39:50.960]  in with what we're speaking about here's some new developments on the flint
[03:39:50.960 --> 03:39:55.280]  case and here we go let's cue up this video and give it a shot
[03:39:55.280 --> 03:40:00.640]  in april of 2014 the flint city council voted seven to one
[03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:05.120]  over the course of the next 21 months to change their water source
[03:40:05.120 --> 03:40:09.040]  from the treated water of lake huron and the detroit river
[03:40:09.040 --> 03:40:12.800]  to the flint river over the course of the next 10 months
[03:40:12.800 --> 03:40:16.800]  water safety protocols concerning the addition of phosphate
[03:40:16.800 --> 03:40:20.800]  to ensure corrosive metal compounds within the flint river
[03:40:20.800 --> 03:40:25.200]  would not harm the people of flint michigan were largely ignored
[03:40:25.200 --> 03:40:28.720]  residents have reported that they found dead bodies floating in this river
[03:40:28.720 --> 03:40:32.160]  before as well as gm and other companies kept the
[03:40:32.160 --> 03:40:37.200]  dowel chemical they would dump a lot of their waste into this river at one time
[03:40:37.200 --> 03:40:40.000]  so residents were just shocked to learn that this was where they were going to
[03:40:40.000 --> 03:40:42.800]  be getting their water supply from and of course we know
[03:40:42.800 --> 03:40:46.080]  there was a lot of issues with how that water was being treated
[03:40:46.080 --> 03:40:49.680]  the way epa operates in general is that
[03:40:49.680 --> 03:40:53.680]  people who are causing trouble by doing their job are simply not allowed to do
[03:40:53.680 --> 03:40:56.720]  their job they are silenced as mr del Toro
[03:40:56.720 --> 03:41:02.000]  was he was told as leon said uh by the ethics officer
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:06.000]  at epa not to speak to anyone from flint
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:09.680]  or about flint he told me that himself before
[03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:14.320]  he was unable to talk to me anymore largely ignored until local flint
[03:41:14.320 --> 03:41:17.280]  michigan mother leon walters noticed that her
[03:41:17.280 --> 03:41:21.360]  children were becoming very sick my home used to be a place of
[03:41:21.360 --> 03:41:25.200]  comfort and safety for my family it used to be what a home should be a place of
[03:41:25.200 --> 03:41:29.600]  peace and protection from the outside world that was taken from us and not
[03:41:29.600 --> 03:41:33.760]  just from my family but from every home and every citizen in flint
[03:41:33.760 --> 03:41:37.840]  now my home is known as ground zero the people in flint now stand with the
[03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:41.760]  people in dc who suffered their own lead crisis a decade ago
[03:41:41.760 --> 03:41:44.880]  because we now know the horror of poison running through our taps
[03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:48.160]  and the negligence of the agencies paid to protect us
[03:41:48.160 --> 03:41:52.080]  i had three tests done by the city of flint using extra steps
[03:41:52.080 --> 03:41:57.200]  that tend to minimize lead in water those numbers were 104 parts per billion
[03:41:57.200 --> 03:42:02.240]  397 parts per billion and 707 parts per billion
[03:42:02.240 --> 03:42:06.000]  i contacted the epa and started working with migal the toro
[03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:10.480]  and jennifer crooks at the epa mr del Toro was very thorough and knowledgeable
[03:42:10.480 --> 03:42:13.520]  and assisting me i told mr del Toro i did not
[03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:17.520]  believe there was corrosion control in the water provided him documentation
[03:42:17.520 --> 03:42:21.840]  about this fact and he verified my findings and he was furious
[03:42:21.840 --> 03:42:25.680]  mr del Toro questioned the mdeq and at first they lied
[03:42:25.680 --> 03:42:31.360]  and then later admitted the truth i figured out that mr crooks was aiding
[03:42:31.360 --> 03:42:35.600]  the mdeq with her lies and mr del Toro was the only one
[03:42:35.600 --> 03:42:39.600]  willing to address the problem i requested a copy of mr del Toro's
[03:42:39.600 --> 03:42:44.080]  report and i made it public because people had a right to know
[03:42:44.080 --> 03:42:47.360]  in a meeting i had with mdeq leanne chapter smith
[03:42:47.360 --> 03:42:50.320]  bragged to me about how mr del Toro had been
[03:42:50.320 --> 03:42:56.080]  handled that his report was flawed and that there would be no final report
[03:42:56.080 --> 03:42:59.360]  this was the ultimate betrayal for the citizens
[03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:03.680]  susan headman cared more about policy than the welfare of the entire community
[03:43:03.680 --> 03:43:07.840]  while punishing and silencing the one person that was willing to help us
[03:43:07.840 --> 03:43:11.120]  the epa is lcr national report from 2006
[03:43:11.120 --> 03:43:15.200]  states that the lack of system response for lead exceedance is especially true
[03:43:15.200 --> 03:43:18.720]  to inform the public it is done less than one third
[03:43:18.720 --> 03:43:23.040]  of the time for my research i have found that this is not a flint problem
[03:43:23.040 --> 03:43:26.560]  or a rare anomaly this is a national problem
[03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:30.400]  only 10 states test accurately in according to the lcr
[03:43:30.400 --> 03:43:33.360]  21 states do not reveal their sampling instructions
[03:43:33.360 --> 03:43:37.360]  and 19 states have testing similar to loopholes to the michigan ones
[03:43:37.360 --> 03:43:42.480]  you should know what happened and it should move from being a question
[03:43:42.480 --> 03:43:46.560]  to actually document it because how can you discipline someone or hold them
[03:43:46.560 --> 03:43:50.400]  accountable if you do not have clear information
[03:43:50.400 --> 03:43:54.400]  a failure of their job and we do have clear standards we have clear
[03:43:54.400 --> 03:43:57.440]  accountabilities we have a clear path forward
[03:43:57.440 --> 03:44:02.560]  we are working in conjunction with both of the
[03:44:02.560 --> 03:44:06.240]  city the state and the federal government to resolve this so it does not
[03:44:06.240 --> 03:44:10.080]  happen again what's the cost of treating the water with the
[03:44:10.080 --> 03:44:14.240]  appropriate amount of phosphates when the switch was made there was
[03:44:14.240 --> 03:44:17.680]  actually no phosphate added at all there was no
[03:44:17.680 --> 03:44:21.280]  corrosion control federal law was not followed no
[03:44:21.280 --> 03:44:26.800]  phosphates at all nothing now safe drink
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:30.160]  we cannot guarantee at this point time the water safe to drink
[03:44:30.160 --> 03:44:35.920]  when did epa administrator mccarthy first been as a flint about this crisis
[03:44:35.920 --> 03:44:38.800]  i believe that yesterday was administrator mccarthy's first visit to
[03:44:38.800 --> 03:44:41.760]  flint wasn't till yesterday that she's visited
[03:44:41.760 --> 03:44:45.520]  for the first time so the day before this hearing
[03:44:45.520 --> 03:44:49.360]  so administrator mccarthy knew about this crisis for eight months
[03:44:49.360 --> 03:44:52.560]  but didn't visit flint till the day before congressional hearing their
[03:44:52.560 --> 03:44:56.480]  response would you conclude is is because of a lack of clarity in the
[03:44:56.480 --> 03:45:02.400]  federal regulations or lack of enforcement or both
[03:45:02.400 --> 03:45:06.080]  in a written letter i wrote to epa office of water
[03:45:06.080 --> 03:45:09.760]  i said point blank that the only thing i can conclude
[03:45:09.760 --> 03:45:14.320]  is that they don't care about children lead poison from drinking water
[03:45:14.320 --> 03:45:19.120]  this fumbling and secretive response to the crisis by michigan's department of
[03:45:19.120 --> 03:45:23.120]  environmental quality the epa the governor of michigan and
[03:45:23.120 --> 03:45:26.800]  ultimately the neglect of the federal government and the president of the
[03:45:26.800 --> 03:45:30.560]  united states resulted in the severely high level of
[03:45:30.560 --> 03:45:34.400]  lead poisoning of six thousand to twelve thousand children
[03:45:34.400 --> 03:45:37.600]  and may have caused an outbreak of legionnaires disease
[03:45:37.600 --> 03:45:41.120]  killing ten all roads that lead to the debacle
[03:45:41.120 --> 03:45:45.200]  in flint michigan dead end at the doorstep of michigan's
[03:45:45.200 --> 03:45:48.720]  criminal and pitiful department of environmental quality
[03:45:48.720 --> 03:45:52.560]  but there were many bureaucratic back alleys along the way
[03:45:52.560 --> 03:45:57.280]  michigan governor rick snider told time magazine on january 14th
[03:45:57.280 --> 03:46:01.680]  that as soon as i became aware of the elevated lead levels in blood
[03:46:01.680 --> 03:46:06.000]  we took action that was on january 5th 2016
[03:46:06.000 --> 03:46:10.960]  many months after water testing revealed that flint's water was unsafe to drink
[03:46:10.960 --> 03:46:15.280]  that governor snider finally declared a state of emergency
[03:46:15.280 --> 03:46:19.040]  federal bureaucracies state agencies and local officials
[03:46:19.040 --> 03:46:23.920]  are willfully damaging and in some cases killing american citizens
[03:46:23.920 --> 03:46:28.000]  due to their negligence and refusal and ability to face up
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:31.760]  to their crimes in a true republic the current epa
[03:46:31.760 --> 03:46:34.960]  overseeing the poisoning of flint michigan's citizens
[03:46:34.960 --> 03:46:40.560]  and their children overseeing a current toxic waste spill in greensboro georgia
[03:46:40.560 --> 03:46:44.560]  and responsible for polluting the animus river in colorado
[03:46:44.560 --> 03:46:48.880]  would be immediately dismantled rather than disciplined
[03:46:48.880 --> 03:46:52.800]  like a wet dog are the people paying right now
[03:46:52.800 --> 03:46:56.960]  in flint for water they cannot wash in and cannot use
[03:46:56.960 --> 03:47:00.960]  and cannot drink are they paying paying water bills and is it a part
[03:47:00.960 --> 03:47:04.000]  of the recovery you said you want to make them whole
[03:47:04.000 --> 03:47:07.280]  is that part of it why are they why would they be paying
[03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:12.160]  for water that they cannot even use that is a poisoning them
[03:47:12.160 --> 03:47:17.040]  strong words on the hill changed nothing and the majority of american people
[03:47:17.040 --> 03:47:21.200]  loathe the spectacle lead poisoning is a growing epidemic
[03:47:21.200 --> 03:47:25.520]  pennsylvania has far higher levels of lead exposure than flint michigan
[03:47:25.520 --> 03:47:29.600]  of course you won't hear filmmaker michael more going after democratic
[03:47:29.600 --> 03:47:33.840]  pennsylvania governor tom wolf that would diminish the media charade
[03:47:33.840 --> 03:47:38.000]  waged against the republicans it's simple the u.s government
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:42.080]  is a bloated circus of incompetence and those responsible
[03:47:42.080 --> 03:47:49.360]  are too big to jail john bound for info wars dot com
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:53.760]  into exactly another sad situation tying in exactly to what we've been
[03:47:53.760 --> 03:47:56.400]  talking about the number one threat to humanity
[03:47:56.400 --> 03:47:59.920]  is vicious people with zero empathy getting into positions of power
[03:47:59.920 --> 03:48:04.320]  and it's funny that he mentioned that at the end that philadelphia
[03:48:04.320 --> 03:48:07.680]  really has led issues as well because remember
[03:48:07.680 --> 03:48:11.840]  about a month or so ago whenever the flint crisis began
[03:48:11.840 --> 03:48:15.760]  i came on and told you about the other cities that were being
[03:48:15.760 --> 03:48:20.000]  ignored that have high lead content and the children that were drinking the
[03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:22.960]  water there but the thing is that the problem is when the
[03:48:22.960 --> 03:48:26.560]  media spotlight goes on to something we may have big freak out about it
[03:48:26.560 --> 03:48:29.920]  and it is sad it's really a sad especially the quote from i guess it was
[03:48:29.920 --> 03:48:32.640]  an investigator in that in that report he says
[03:48:32.640 --> 03:48:35.680]  i concluded the only thing that could have possibly been
[03:48:35.680 --> 03:48:38.640]  possibly have been going on is they didn't care about children drinking the
[03:48:38.640 --> 03:48:44.800]  lead that is disturbing but there are other cities
[03:48:44.800 --> 03:48:48.720]  with lead content and everything else in the water too right not to mention all
[03:48:48.720 --> 03:48:51.680]  of that and all the stuff we eat in our food supply blah blah blah blah
[03:48:51.680 --> 03:48:56.400]  but until the media spotlight goes down on it it's completely ignored
[03:48:56.400 --> 03:49:00.560]  but in reality it's a systematic problem of people
[03:49:00.560 --> 03:49:04.640]  that just don't care if it's hurting you if it benefits them
[03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:09.280]  and that is what we're talking about want to get into some zika virus news
[03:49:09.280 --> 03:49:13.280]  real quick before rob do joins us in the next segment to tell us what's coming

[03:49:16.480 --> 03:49:23.200]  for the first time zika folder for the first time zika zika has
[03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:26.560]  spread apparently first confirmed case pregnancy case
[03:49:26.560 --> 03:49:30.320]  in spain spain has confirmed that a pregnant woman has been diagnosed with
[03:49:30.320 --> 03:49:33.840]  the zika virus the first such case in europe the health ministry said the
[03:49:33.840 --> 03:49:36.080]  woman had recently returned from columbia
[03:49:36.080 --> 03:49:39.600]  where just believe she was infected zika which is spreading through the americas
[03:49:39.600 --> 03:49:43.200]  has been linked to babies being born with underdeveloped brains
[03:49:43.200 --> 03:49:46.960]  and yes it's also been according to this spanish
[03:49:46.960 --> 03:49:51.040]  paper men abandon mothers of babies with micro
[03:49:51.040 --> 03:49:55.760]  cephalia in pe doctors report cases of relationships
[03:49:55.760 --> 03:49:59.840]  cephalin microcephaly sorry doctors report cases of relationships that are
[03:49:59.840 --> 03:50:02.880]  broken even during pregnancy or because of birth

[03:50:07.280 --> 03:50:11.760]  and unfortunately a lot of men once they realize what what what cowards
[03:50:11.760 --> 03:50:16.000]  once they realize that the babies are deformed aren't leaving the women
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:19.760]  and running away very manly thing to do higher temperatures
[03:50:19.760 --> 03:50:24.640]  make zika more likely to spread this is from cbs news the mosquito behind the
[03:50:24.640 --> 03:50:27.360]  zika virus seems to operate like a heat driven
[03:50:27.360 --> 03:50:30.640]  missile of disease the hotter it gets the better the mosquito
[03:50:30.640 --> 03:50:34.160]  that carries the zika virus is it transmitting its buffet of
[03:50:34.160 --> 03:50:38.640]  dangerous illnesses scientists say so it's very
[03:50:38.640 --> 03:50:42.080]  possible that it will continue to spread once it gets warmer

[03:54:15.680 --> 03:54:17.840]  but i just want to get his take on a few things
[03:54:17.840 --> 03:54:20.960]  so we've been talking about some really disturbing news right
[03:54:20.960 --> 03:54:25.680]  india holding its food stairs for days and weeks and months
[03:54:25.680 --> 03:54:30.160]  and 3 000 kids a day dying right and then you have you know they also have cows
[03:54:30.160 --> 03:54:33.120]  walking around the street there and they're not allowed to eat them
[03:54:33.120 --> 03:54:35.920]  right that's that's that's that's also a thing in india
[03:54:35.920 --> 03:54:40.160]  residents of moon by can barely see as massive week-long garbage fire burns
[03:54:40.160 --> 03:54:43.760]  can be seen from nasa actually i sent the article we can show
[03:54:43.760 --> 03:54:48.720]  nasa footage of this massive burning trash pile in moon by
[03:54:48.720 --> 03:54:55.040]  can be seen from the space and firefighters and bulldozers have
[03:54:55.040 --> 03:54:57.600]  been fighting to contain the fire but it's not working
[03:54:57.600 --> 03:55:01.600]  the trash is blowing into the city of 21 million people people look out their
[03:55:01.600 --> 03:55:04.560]  window and they can't hardly see anything there's pictures from the article
[03:55:04.560 --> 03:55:08.080]  too and they say it's a horrible smell looks
[03:55:08.080 --> 03:55:11.920]  like a post apocalyptic holocaust it could have been the blm in
[03:55:11.920 --> 03:55:15.280]  there actually starting a fire to you know get rid of the brush and
[03:55:15.280 --> 03:55:18.480]  everything yeah that's what that probably
[03:55:18.480 --> 03:55:22.640]  it's ridiculous what i'm getting at i mean 806 people
[03:55:22.640 --> 03:55:27.280]  die per year in india from falling off trains because they have to jump on the
[03:55:27.280 --> 03:55:31.680]  side mm-hmm 3 349 people including 588 women have
[03:55:31.680 --> 03:55:35.920]  died in the railway premises 806 806 actually died by
[03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:39.840]  falling off 4079 died of natural causes on the train
[03:55:39.840 --> 03:55:43.200]  and then you have the Taliban killing 10 year olds
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:46.640]  that were considered heroes just total insanity
[03:55:46.640 --> 03:55:50.560]  and it reminds me of two things number one we have to stop corruption we have
[03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:54.000]  to stop vicious empathelous people from controlling us and
[03:55:54.000 --> 03:55:57.120]  controlling our government but number two we have to remember what we have
[03:55:57.120 --> 03:55:59.920]  right we have to remember and be grateful for our situation
[03:55:59.920 --> 03:56:05.200]  because people are in trash heaps dying off of trains
[03:56:05.200 --> 03:56:07.760]  on the street crying for food that's in front of them
[03:56:07.760 --> 03:56:11.600]  unreleased as kids die every day we cover our trash fires up
[03:56:11.600 --> 03:56:15.280]  like they do in st louis so we don't let them open air we
[03:56:15.280 --> 03:56:18.480]  we can't see our trash fires from nasa we cover them up and let them get to the
[03:56:18.480 --> 03:56:22.320]  radioactive waste slowly underground that's how we're better
[03:56:22.320 --> 03:56:26.000]  right and i don't be a sarcastic i understand and like i said there's
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:29.120]  obviously similar corruption with 8.5 trillion missing in the pentagon
[03:56:29.120 --> 03:56:32.320]  yeah and we're just as guilty as wasting food as they are
[03:56:32.320 --> 03:56:36.000]  you know as the problem is is corrupt people and people with lack of empathy
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:38.880]  and people who get into these positions of power because all they want is power
[03:56:38.880 --> 03:56:42.480]  they really don't want to help people they just want to control people
[03:56:42.480 --> 03:56:46.000]  and that's the type of sickos that we have in all over the world alex just did
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:49.760]  a video we're going to premiere tonight talking about how uh who's who's in the
[03:56:49.760 --> 03:56:51.520]  one percent and you'd be surprised a lot of
[03:56:51.520 --> 03:56:54.400]  bernie lovers out there are going to be really surprised one percent means
[03:56:54.400 --> 03:56:57.120]  nothing it means absolutely nothing and he talks about that too
[03:56:57.120 --> 03:56:59.280]  how it's absolutely nothing it's meaningful i'm not sure of the exact
[03:56:59.280 --> 03:57:02.720]  numbers but i think if you make over 250 or is it or is it three or four
[03:57:02.720 --> 03:57:06.960]  it's it's between 250 and 400 thousand which someone can make at a at a
[03:57:06.960 --> 03:57:09.760]  corporate job right or a non you can make that a
[03:57:09.760 --> 03:57:11.760]  non-profit it's not it's not it doesn't even mean anything
[03:57:11.760 --> 03:57:15.280]  one percent means nothing it's the point zero zero zero zero one percent
[03:57:15.280 --> 03:57:19.040]  that have 50 billion dollars and i wouldn't even say that all billionaires
[03:57:19.040 --> 03:57:22.480]  are bad it's just you know yeah it's it's an absurd thing but
[03:57:22.480 --> 03:57:24.000]  what else are you going to talk about in the night
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:27.120]  i might have leah macadoon we're going to talk about what's going on with uh
[03:57:27.120 --> 03:57:30.640]  the zika virus and also the new Plain Parenthood video that came out uh it was
[03:57:30.640 --> 03:57:33.760]  on Breitbart today where they were talking about how they
[03:57:33.760 --> 03:57:38.480]  cover they use fake accounting to hide the the numbers of what what they're
[03:57:38.480 --> 03:57:40.880]  doing with these um poor little babies you know it's
[03:57:40.880 --> 03:57:43.360]  totally disgusting i'm also going to have jeremy breen and we're going to talk
[03:57:43.360 --> 03:57:46.960]  about media hoaxes and also you know the biggest media hoax that the nfl
[03:57:46.960 --> 03:57:49.840]  runs basically that they're so pro-military the only reason they're
[03:57:49.840 --> 03:57:52.720]  pro-military is that they're being paid to be
[03:57:52.720 --> 03:57:56.000]  pro-military well let's check that out that actually
[03:57:56.000 --> 03:57:59.600]  sounds like a lot of and we're going to cover a lot of other things and how the
[03:57:59.600 --> 03:58:02.640]  police uh we have documented proof now video proof
[03:58:02.640 --> 03:58:07.200]  of how police aren't going to protect you when it starts coming down to it
[03:58:07.200 --> 03:58:10.720]  when guns are drawn police run and we got video that didn't happen in this
[03:58:10.720 --> 03:58:13.520]  country but it happened in a country just south of us i
[03:58:13.520 --> 03:58:16.800]  bet you can figure out which country it is but stay tuned tonight for the info
