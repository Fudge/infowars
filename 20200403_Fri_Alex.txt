[00:00.000 --> 00:29.880]  everything is now coming into focus the globalists and their world-wide
[00:29.880 --> 00:34.520]  extermination plan is going from hidden to being out in plain view and it's all
[00:34.520 --> 00:38.960]  being sold in the name of keeping us safe everything is scripted by mega
[00:38.960 --> 00:43.080]  corporations the communist Chinese and left his controlled cities to set the
[00:43.080 --> 00:48.760]  precedent it's rolled out incrementally oh first to stay home have a two week
[00:48.760 --> 00:57.520]  extended vacation a long spring break go to the park have fun next oh stay six
[00:57.520 --> 01:02.400]  feet away next day 20 feet away next don't be at the park at all next oh we're
[01:02.400 --> 01:04.920]  just gonna shut down the bars and restaurants oh now it's all the other
[01:04.920 --> 01:11.680]  small businesses only big mega corporations are essential and now we
[01:11.680 --> 01:17.720]  told you was coming a few weeks ago master mandatory first the LA mayor
[01:17.720 --> 01:26.880]  ask you to wear them that was two days ago now we're gonna arrest you and don't
[01:26.880 --> 01:32.840]  worry all those masks from China those used masks are landing in LA and New
[01:32.840 --> 01:38.680]  York and the Chinese have been caught spiking them with coronavirus and the
[01:38.680 --> 01:45.800]  blood testing kits that's a special little special little prick you get on
[01:45.800 --> 01:51.200]  your finger and they're giving you a gift now it's all coming into view and
[01:51.200 --> 02:02.240]  next segment I am going to cover all of that and break it down and then at the
[02:02.240 --> 02:08.320]  bottom of the hour I'm going to cover the most life and death situation and
[02:08.320 --> 02:14.920]  what we're really facing as a species and as the quickening accelerates more
[02:14.920 --> 02:18.600]  and more often I say this is the most important broadcast ever first of all
[02:18.600 --> 02:21.720]  probably said that was 20 years ago I would say every two or three years then
[02:21.720 --> 02:25.280]  a decade ago I've said every few months and now I say it every few days it's
[02:25.280 --> 02:34.800]  just gets crazier and crazier and out the open but it's now confirmed I have in
[02:34.800 --> 02:41.360]  front of me dozens of mainline studies admissions all of it that all of the
[02:41.360 --> 02:51.800]  cell phone radiation 1g through 5g and now 6g absolutely triggers disease
[02:51.800 --> 03:01.120]  cancer mental illness depression in rodents not just humans and that the
[03:01.120 --> 03:08.680]  reason 5g so bad is that they're gonna put up six million towers and so it
[03:08.680 --> 03:17.400]  doesn't go as far because it's so strong but it's only strong up close and it
[03:17.400 --> 03:21.280]  basically fries you and it's way worse than the others because unless you lived
[03:21.280 --> 03:25.600]  right next to a cell tower you got some of the ambient problems but it was when
[03:25.600 --> 03:29.360]  they put them right on top of school that you'd have 50 kids and 15 20 of them
[03:29.360 --> 03:32.600]  would get you know brain tumors then that's been confirmed that's in the
[03:32.600 --> 03:41.280]  literature that's in the studies because as you know with any wave whatever the
[03:41.280 --> 03:45.680]  length of the antenna is every length out from the antenna it cuts the power
[03:45.680 --> 03:51.400]  of the transmission in half well now with 5g every road you go down every
[03:51.400 --> 03:56.240]  business you go in every movie theater every hospital every school has them in
[03:56.240 --> 04:03.760]  it frying you at point blank range and it's a microwave and it oscillates the
[04:03.760 --> 04:10.400]  cells and breaks DNA and when DNA breaks you get something called ca ca ca ca
[04:10.400 --> 04:17.920]  cancer two ways to get cancer the RNA of a virus goes in and reprogram cells to
[04:17.920 --> 04:24.680]  create and reprogram the cells to grow out of their natural order that is one
[04:24.680 --> 04:27.400]  of the most common forms and the globalists know that almost no one even
[04:27.400 --> 04:31.120]  talks about the general public there's a just general ignorance and then the
[04:31.120 --> 04:37.280]  other one and that's from the DNA being broken or malfunctioning and mutating as
[04:37.280 --> 04:43.280]  you get older well 5g because I don't real quick for him so get ready to die
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.480]  get ready to die get ready they're killing you they're killing everybody but
[04:48.480 --> 04:53.600]  the good news is people are finally starting to wake up oh and 5g on record
[04:53.600 --> 05:01.600]  up the studies helps viruses infect you better as bad as things are with now
[05:01.600 --> 05:05.240]  more than half the world population under martial law being directed by the
[05:05.240 --> 05:11.240]  UN there is a massive awakening happening to the tyranny of big pharma and
[05:11.240 --> 05:15.960]  the medical mafia and the forced inoculations in the UN admitting that
[05:15.960 --> 05:20.000]  vaccines are killing people and they've covered it up and everywhere I go I am
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.320]  just mob my folks on the street now even in leftist Austin who used to attack me
[05:25.320 --> 05:29.680]  just a few years ago saying you were right about 5g 5g is killing us I
[05:29.680 --> 05:35.520]  looked it up it's causing cancer it destroys immunity it says that it makes
[05:35.520 --> 05:41.640]  it easier for viruses to attack people are really starting to wake up and they
[05:41.640 --> 05:47.720]  know they're under attack at a spiritual and subconscious cellular level so now
[05:47.720 --> 05:52.400]  my friends educate everyone you know they're ready to listen they're ready
[05:52.400 --> 05:58.880]  to learn they're ready to take action I'm Alex Jones and this is the info war
[06:06.240 --> 06:12.960]  it is Friday April 3rd we yearless 2020 the election is two one three out will
[06:12.960 --> 06:18.720]  probably be cancelled we know this is a concerted choreographed global rollout
[06:18.720 --> 06:23.560]  of a straight jacket a noose being fitted around our necks it's all
[06:23.560 --> 06:28.320]  official Australian Prime Minister just said you will be locked in your homes for
[06:28.320 --> 06:32.120]  at least six months you said I'm gonna be honest maybe a year and a half that's
[06:32.120 --> 06:36.960]  the official UN plan now we're being told it's a two-week holiday and it's a
[06:36.960 --> 06:40.720]  month holiday and now don't leave your houses soon it'll be the law to wear
[06:40.720 --> 06:45.960]  masks by next week and they're already announcing that media is not essential
[06:45.960 --> 06:51.760]  and the press will then be shut down lights out this is America going into a
[06:51.760 --> 06:55.080]  depression I've got a stack of major studies just out showing social
[06:55.080 --> 06:58.760]  distancing will destroy movie theaters baseball forever turning us into
[06:58.760 --> 07:02.400]  neurotic crazy people and that actually when you're not exposed a lot of hours
[07:02.400 --> 07:07.720]  as a bacteria that you defeat that you become weaker this is a planned post
[07:07.720 --> 07:13.720]  human post industrial world agenda 2030 that they said they would execute when I
[07:13.720 --> 07:21.160]  made the film in game 14 years ago in documents from the 80s and 90s and 2000s
[07:21.160 --> 07:25.960]  where they said we will use a deadly virus to bring in world government and a
[07:25.960 --> 07:29.760]  lockdown of society with high tech surveillance face scanning to leave your
[07:29.760 --> 07:39.440]  home with drones enforcing that's in my film 14 years old how did I do it they
[07:39.440 --> 07:43.800]  admitted it all see that's what's so frustrating for me
[07:45.320 --> 07:52.600]  this is the lock down then the forced inoculations which are the soft kill and
[07:52.600 --> 07:56.360]  when you look at Fauci who is behind the whole AIDS operation and the guy is
[07:56.360 --> 08:01.280]  evil you have to understand that we're in big trouble this is a UN world
[08:01.280 --> 08:04.560]  government takeover and Fauci said you're not allowed to leave your home
[08:04.560 --> 08:10.240]  until no one dies of a cold virus or flu again that's impossible that's total
[08:10.240 --> 08:14.000]  control and it's being announced Australian Prime Minister says six months
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.360]  and if they don't have a vaccine by then you will not be able to leave your home
[08:17.360 --> 08:25.200]  unless you have the vaccine that is news of Australia got that video coming up
[08:25.200 --> 08:32.480]  here's part of a report I filed today that is super critical titled confirm
[08:32.480 --> 08:37.760]  China launched COVID-19 to take down the Western world and to kill any free
[08:37.760 --> 08:41.520]  countries reports at Band-Aid video here is the first intro to it as they
[08:41.520 --> 08:47.280]  begin to transfer the bio weapon medical supplies and masks to the United
[08:47.280 --> 08:51.440]  States here it is Bob Kraft and team president Jonathan Kraft commissioned
[08:51.440 --> 08:56.520]  New England's team plane aircraft to fly to China to transport 1.2 million
[08:56.520 --> 09:01.400]  and 95 protective masks back to Massachusetts aircraft on the ground in
[09:01.400 --> 09:05.560]  China in Shenzhen the Kraft team plane was permitted to be on the ground for
[09:05.560 --> 09:10.800]  three hours it reportedly took two hours and 57 minutes to load the 1.2
[09:10.800 --> 09:15.080]  million masks onto the plane which are essential to the safety of health
[09:15.080 --> 09:19.440]  workers exposed to COVID-19 but are currently in short supply
[09:19.440 --> 09:23.360]  meanwhile they wiped their feet with them with COVID-19 and all over TV and
[09:23.360 --> 09:27.560]  totally brag about it their gold kill America the information I'm about to
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.040]  lay out is the most important information that you your family your
[09:32.040 --> 09:37.520]  neighborhood your town your state your country and the world could know please
[09:37.520 --> 09:41.720]  research this information for yourself it's all publicly admitted and hiding
[09:41.720 --> 09:46.360]  in plain view and then share this information with others however you
[09:46.360 --> 09:53.800]  can communist China launched the COVID-19 man-made weaponized common
[09:53.800 --> 10:00.920]  cold coronavirus in November of last year Pentagon report confirms this that
[10:00.920 --> 10:05.360]  they covered up the fact that it was highly communicable and way way more
[10:05.360 --> 10:10.440]  deadly than the regular cold and that it targets the reproductive systems of
[10:10.440 --> 10:19.520]  men now let me lay out the facts and the proof it is now in mainstream news even
[10:19.520 --> 10:24.880]  and major medical firms and major global testing facilities some of the top in
[10:24.880 --> 10:31.200]  the world funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that in England and in
[10:31.200 --> 10:37.160]  Germany and all over Europe in Central and South America in Canada in Australia
[10:37.160 --> 10:43.000]  particularly in South Korea all over the world China has shipped contaminated
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.080]  testing kits where they prick your finger to get the blood test that have
[10:50.080 --> 10:54.600]  COVID-19 on them the headlines will say may be contaminated but then you read
[10:54.600 --> 10:59.280]  the reports in the article and these prestigious firms are saying no it was
[10:59.280 --> 11:04.920]  contaminated it's doctors it's virologist it's it's experts coming out that
[11:04.920 --> 11:09.640]  tested it and said it's on these also China's been caught shipping mask out
[11:09.640 --> 11:15.280]  they claim are new that are used and they're shipping them to Italy Germany
[11:15.280 --> 11:20.360]  France they're shipping them to the United States they're using the aircraft
[11:20.360 --> 11:25.200]  that the Patriots own and have donated to ship them in to the East Coast they're
[11:25.200 --> 11:29.280]  shipping them into LA and the mayor saying you're gonna have to wear masks
[11:29.280 --> 11:34.520]  well there's a shortage but ah China donated somehow sweet they knew it was
[11:34.520 --> 11:40.120]  released they knew it was man-made major universities in India and the US have
[11:40.120 --> 11:44.480]  come out and scan the virus and said it's manufactured has the HIV delivery
[11:44.480 --> 11:48.920]  system doesn't give you HIV it has the HIV delivery system this is unbelievable
[11:48.920 --> 11:53.680]  and that came into the news and left the news but you see the Senate Intelligence
[11:53.680 --> 11:57.520]  Committee you see British intelligence and you see the Pentagon saying there
[11:57.520 --> 12:02.120]  will be a reckoning with communist China you see Trump saying he's friends with
[12:02.120 --> 12:06.880]  Xi Jinping and wants all this to be fixed that's because he has to play the
[12:06.880 --> 12:12.680]  good cop all the surrogates play the bad cop and that's what's happening the
[12:12.680 --> 12:15.840]  experts are clear this was man-made China launched it they covered up how bad
[12:15.840 --> 12:19.600]  it was they lobby Trump to leave our borders open and let aircraft fly in
[12:19.600 --> 12:26.520]  from China to spread it as carriers the Democrats tried to block Trump federal
[12:26.520 --> 12:28.680]  judges tried to block Trump and now they've turned around and they're
[12:28.680 --> 12:34.200]  blaming Trump for the virus spread and for the plunging economy to drive him
[12:34.200 --> 12:39.600]  from office and that's what deep status publicly set on CNN MSNBC on HBO with
[12:39.600 --> 12:43.280]  Bill Maher that they were going to take the economy ahead of the election to
[12:43.280 --> 12:47.920]  drive Trump for office and maybe even suspend the election and remove the
[12:47.920 --> 12:50.240]  president and now they're talking about that as well
[12:50.240 --> 12:54.360]  the president tweeted earlier linking the closing of the country to your
[12:54.360 --> 12:59.600]  election success in November is this Easter timeline based on your political
[12:59.600 --> 13:06.080]  interests you said that the media wants the country remain closed to hurt your
[13:06.080 --> 13:13.120]  I think there are certain people that would like it not to open so quickly I
[13:13.120 --> 13:16.320]  think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly
[13:16.320 --> 13:20.240]  because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls
[13:20.240 --> 13:24.560]  because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy so please
[13:24.560 --> 13:28.800]  bring on the recession one woman said I want a recession because that'll help
[13:28.800 --> 13:32.080]  get rid of Donald Trump I call this another Trump slump the threat of
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.120]  recession is real that we would see the global economy entering recession in
[13:36.120 --> 13:40.400]  three-quarters perfect timing I say I mean I've been rooting for a recession
[13:40.400 --> 13:43.600]  if the global economy including the United States is taking a step toward
[13:43.600 --> 13:46.400]  recession what does that mean for the presidency
[13:46.400 --> 13:52.280]  it's political suicide these numbers are irrefutable this may be Donald Trump's
[13:52.280 --> 14:00.680]  Katrina yeah let's just lean into that but as far as the winning economy that
[14:00.680 --> 14:04.320]  the president needs from now until November do you really see that changing
[14:04.320 --> 14:09.080]  if the stock market were to tumble this year if we don't get near the 3% GDP
[14:09.080 --> 14:12.560]  growth that this administration's been talking about for years these are all
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.160]  things that Dems can run on and they pose a problem a recession is a
[14:16.160 --> 14:21.760]  survivable event what Trump is doing to this country is not so the president is
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.160]  being a railroad where if he doesn't say it's the end of the world real people
[14:26.160 --> 14:29.760]  are gonna die and then every death is his fault that's the new president said
[14:29.760 --> 14:34.000]  if he totally goes along with it it then creates a depression and they're
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.880]  gonna turn on the president once we're in that depression the president needs to
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.360]  know when Jim Acosta starts praising him for his strong corona response that
[14:42.360 --> 14:46.640]  he's being set up and the president knows that he's riding a tiger because
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.720]  the American people panicked they bought into the fear they bought into the
[14:50.720 --> 14:56.480]  hysteria that one person can't even die that's what Fauci said he said the
[14:56.480 --> 15:01.840]  checkpoints the lockdown all of it will end the social distancing when we don't
[15:01.840 --> 15:05.800]  have any more deaths and they're basically no more cases well that's
[15:05.800 --> 15:10.560]  impossible it's the common cold but it's souped up and when they say that oh
[15:10.560 --> 15:15.760]  don't worry this is the key we'll have a vaccine by next year they've never had a
[15:15.760 --> 15:20.040]  common cold vaccine that's what the coronavirus is because it mutates
[15:20.040 --> 15:24.160]  thousands of times a year you have to have the exact mutation to stop that
[15:24.160 --> 15:27.160]  other exact virus that's why the flu vaccine never works because they can
[15:27.160 --> 15:30.880]  never guess the new mutations there's always a whole bunch of them so it's
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.760]  gonna be what's in that vaccine that you better know is what you should really
[15:35.760 --> 15:39.240]  be concerned about because it's a live a virus vaccine that Bill and Linda Gates
[15:39.240 --> 15:45.400]  already patented the cloned virus last year and what does the virus do it
[15:45.400 --> 15:48.380]  attacks the testicles what does Gardasil do it attacks women's
[15:48.380 --> 15:52.240]  ovaries all right folks the full report that's only half of it is at bandod

[17:23.520 --> 17:26.800]  the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[17:26.800 --> 17:30.280]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the
[17:30.280 --> 17:33.840]  system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the
[17:33.840 --> 17:37.560]  floodwaters backstory so here's what you should do right now check out the PPX
[17:37.560 --> 17:42.880]  microgrid system at my own power grid dot com that's my own power grid dot com
[17:42.880 --> 17:46.880]  over a thousand dollars in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses
[17:46.880 --> 17:52.040]  too in the best part you're not gonna pay 750 or $500 300 or even 200 go to my
[17:52.040 --> 17:59.360]  own power grid dot com to learn more that's my own power grid dot com the
[17:59.360 --> 18:05.560]  ultimate tyranny would be a nanny state that would not allow anyone to ever do
[18:05.560 --> 18:10.120]  anything that could possibly hurt them and that's the globalist plan and now
[18:10.120 --> 18:14.640]  mr. Fauci at the NIH last night in the press conference standing right next to
[18:14.640 --> 18:19.000]  president said we're gonna have a global lockdown because he talked to world
[18:19.000 --> 18:26.840]  leaders until not one more person is dying or one more person is infected the
[18:26.840 --> 18:30.560]  videos posted on info wars dot com ladies and gentlemen that sets the
[18:30.560 --> 18:35.160]  precedent where not one person can die from the flu not one person can die
[18:35.160 --> 18:39.480]  from a cold everyone will be surveilled in lifetime by their cell phones and
[18:39.480 --> 18:45.800]  apps and drones and an absolute straight jacket of pure medical tyranny and
[18:45.800 --> 18:49.360]  remember it's big pharma that has a level for bioweapons labs that keeps
[18:49.360 --> 18:54.320]  leaking all these man-made viruses they're holding us all hostage oh and he
[18:54.320 --> 19:02.320]  talked about forced annotulations do yourself a favor and fund the info war
[19:02.320 --> 19:07.960]  at the same time go to info wars or calm and read about the ingredients of the
[19:07.960 --> 19:11.440]  highest quality like black walnut and others that are in this baby and then
[19:11.440 --> 19:14.720]  read some of those reviews for yourself and then don't just believe info wars
[19:14.720 --> 19:19.400]  go out online at major nutrition sites and others and look at the studies for
[19:19.400 --> 19:23.400]  yourself go out and engage in your first amendment right to research but your
[19:23.400 --> 19:27.760]  first amendment right to tell others about incredible compounds God has given
[19:27.760 --> 19:31.920]  us from other nature living defense is it info wars or calm sold out for four
[19:31.920 --> 19:37.440]  months now back in stock for a limited time at 40% off people are doing their
[19:37.440 --> 19:41.520]  own research and they're getting living defense at 40% off info wars or calm
[19:41.520 --> 19:44.920]  and we've got our great super blue toothpaste the best seller for five
[19:44.920 --> 19:48.720]  years with the nano silver the tea tree and the iodine it's selling out still
[19:48.720 --> 19:53.380]  50% off and the iodine selling out the x3 it's 60% off because I want
[19:53.380 --> 19:57.000]  you to experience how amazing it is
[20:00.280 --> 20:05.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:05.720 --> 20:14.560]  you've got it
[20:16.120 --> 20:25.140]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[20:25.140 --> 20:31.220]  lines of the info war all right we can sit here and break down the fact that
[20:31.220 --> 20:34.140]  they're about to make mass mandatory and that this is a year and a half
[20:34.140 --> 20:37.740]  lockdown and that we'll never have freedom again and that we're all gonna
[20:37.740 --> 20:42.460]  have apps on our phones it's all been pre-planned it's already being prepared
[20:42.460 --> 20:47.060]  at the corporate level to be rolled out you'll have your little past leave your
[20:47.060 --> 20:52.980]  home and the establishment will decide what's essential this is the end of
[20:52.980 --> 20:58.060]  freedom as we know it this is the new world order making its move but we've
[20:58.060 --> 21:02.100]  not been hit flat-footed and most people I've talked to are not going along with
[21:02.100 --> 21:07.140]  this and are not buying into it and know that it is garbage that it's not
[21:07.140 --> 21:11.500]  protecting us from a virus and they understand that it's all about a power
[21:11.500 --> 21:15.820]  grab and has been pre-positioned and that the virus was man-made released by
[21:15.820 --> 21:23.180]  the deep-state globalist with their chai-com handlers but I want to play
[21:23.180 --> 21:26.700]  something for you that's been going around and has millions of years that I
[21:26.700 --> 21:33.500]  went and watched it some research on and it's dead on medical doctor Thomas Cohen
[21:33.500 --> 21:38.500]  he has a prestigious background in private practice and hospitals and
[21:38.500 --> 21:44.220]  published studies and bunch of us selling books okay so he's a he's a big
[21:44.220 --> 21:53.260]  guy we'll show you overhead shot of that he's come out lecturing to students and
[21:53.260 --> 22:04.340]  others that every time we invented radio or we use radar World War one World War
[22:04.340 --> 22:10.060]  two and radar came one World War two that every time there was a new wavelength
[22:10.060 --> 22:15.740]  that was powerful massive plagues would erupt and if you go back to the
[22:15.740 --> 22:19.180]  ancients when there were sunspots there would be plagues and wars would start in
[22:19.180 --> 22:23.660]  bane capital and Wall Street knows that you can even look up it's taught in
[22:23.660 --> 22:28.820]  mainline business school that they track sunspots for civil unrest and disease
[22:28.820 --> 22:33.820]  because sunspots are giant coronal ejections thousands of times the size
[22:33.820 --> 22:39.420]  of the earth that shoot out into space and the actual most the solar radiation
[22:39.420 --> 22:42.580]  is dampened as it goes out but a lot of it isn't and there's all sorts of
[22:42.580 --> 22:48.100]  different x-rays and things in there whole spectrum of things now they're
[22:48.100 --> 22:52.260]  discovering new things with devices they had that they never knew existed just
[22:52.260 --> 22:55.500]  like there's dark matter other forms of energy that we couldn't read before and
[22:55.500 --> 22:59.740]  still can't read we're just detecting it that's coming out of the sun so just
[22:59.740 --> 23:03.460]  like your skin burns if you go out at high noon in July and lay out for an hour
[23:03.460 --> 23:09.460]  well imagine what's going through your body okay well he goes into that he's
[23:09.460 --> 23:12.140]  got a bunch of lectures I've seen a few of these a week or so ago and people
[23:12.140 --> 23:16.300]  kept bringing up me my wife everybody and I said no it's true it's mainline
[23:16.300 --> 23:20.500]  science just the public is ignorant about things like this I want to start
[23:20.500 --> 23:25.340]  with this and then come back and lay it all out because it's that our body
[23:25.340 --> 23:29.740]  harmonizes with the Sun and and and with all this systems in the universe but
[23:29.740 --> 23:33.820]  all this artificial stuff can be oscillated up and down and the change
[23:33.820 --> 23:38.140]  is not gradual it's very sudden and it does cause cancer and it does cause
[23:38.140 --> 23:42.420]  mental illness I'll show you dozens of mainline studies and prestigious
[23:42.420 --> 23:47.180]  scientific Institute saying don't do this it's hurting people but you get a
[23:47.180 --> 23:51.980]  lot more than cancer from this and a lot more than infertility so he lays it
[23:51.980 --> 23:57.620]  out in a group of videos but I'm gonna air some of it now some when we come back
[23:57.620 --> 24:00.180]  and then I'm gonna really get into what's happening because there's a huge
[24:00.180 --> 24:04.860]  awakening taking place and people are attacking and torching 5g towers that
[24:04.860 --> 24:08.540]  are hidden of course they're very smart how they do it all over the place but
[24:08.540 --> 24:13.900]  people are attacking them I don't recommend fire that could spread and
[24:13.900 --> 24:17.740]  hurt others I mean it's pretty effective just to tie a truck to it with a
[24:17.740 --> 24:20.700]  chain and pull it out or get it with a baseball bat cuz a lot of them are low
[24:20.700 --> 24:23.820]  level I mean I'm not saying do that I'm just saying I don't think arson is the
[24:23.820 --> 24:26.820]  way to go about this as the human rebellion starts against the
[24:26.820 --> 24:31.260]  technocracy that will happen we will win by the way so let me just get back to
[24:31.260 --> 24:38.180]  the but I was covering right now all of this is killing us it's by design but
[24:38.180 --> 24:41.820]  more importantly it's controlling us and MIT admits they can oscillate these
[24:41.820 --> 24:47.300]  waves to control mood and the CIA put out a press release in 1999 talking about
[24:47.300 --> 24:51.020]  it that I saw in the Baltimore Sun I read on air but they were oscillating
[24:51.020 --> 24:55.700]  cell towers and controlling people's moods with them so this is very very very
[24:55.700 --> 25:02.260]  serious okay and it's science and it's fact and they just think they're gonna
[25:02.260 --> 25:06.180]  hook all this up and we don't know what's going on but he goes on to explain
[25:06.180 --> 25:09.820]  that's why you look at the maps it's not just that it's big cities some of these
[25:09.820 --> 25:13.060]  big cities haven't put in 5g yet they don't have the virus low even though
[25:13.060 --> 25:16.060]  they had all the foreign travelers too and you look at the studies
[25:16.060 --> 25:20.540]  electromagnetic radiation cell phone radiation 2g 3g 4g 5g they're just
[25:20.540 --> 25:24.980]  different systems they all over immunity and weaken the body of viruses and
[25:24.980 --> 25:28.660]  that's why when you get a huge solar flare that hits the earth or a group of
[25:28.660 --> 25:32.900]  them it causes changes and the body's got to deal with that and it's
[25:32.900 --> 25:37.380]  electromagnetic immune system your immune systems all hooked up to that
[25:37.380 --> 25:42.340]  just like they know people in caves still get on the Sarkadian rhythm of
[25:42.340 --> 25:47.580]  night and day because it's magnetic it's not just solar light or radiation of
[25:47.580 --> 25:54.940]  that type so that's what's really going on here so let's let's let's get to a
[25:54.940 --> 25:57.100]  few minutes we'll come back and play more then I'm gonna lay out the big
[25:57.100 --> 26:02.460]  enchilada that that yes it is causing people to have the COVID-19 and other
[26:02.460 --> 26:09.780]  viruses be much more deadly here it is now I have 10 minutes I wasn't sure I
[26:09.780 --> 26:16.060]  was gonna get to this stage but I can't help but say something about this whole
[26:16.060 --> 26:28.260]  coronavirus thing if you want me to so again when you know Steiner you have the
[26:28.260 --> 26:35.660]  answers to the test but you have to then figure out the details in 1918 after
[26:35.660 --> 26:44.140]  the huge biggest pandemic the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 Steiner was asked
[26:44.140 --> 26:52.340]  what was this all about and he said well viruses are simply excretions of a toxic
[26:52.340 --> 27:00.740]  cell viruses are pieces of DNA or RNA with a few other proteins they butt out
[27:00.740 --> 27:07.900]  from the cell they happen when the cell is poisoned they are not the cause of
[27:07.900 --> 27:13.460]  anything and the first way I would encourage you to think about this is if
[27:13.460 --> 27:18.740]  you are a famous dolphin doctor right and you have been studying dolphins in
[27:18.740 --> 27:23.580]  the Arctic Circle for hundreds of years or at least a long time and the
[27:23.580 --> 27:29.300]  dolphins were fine and then they call you up Fred all the dolphins or a lot of
[27:29.300 --> 27:35.140]  the dolphins are dying in the Arctic Circle can you come and investigate right
[27:35.140 --> 27:41.580]  and you have one question to ask so show of hands how many of you would say I
[27:41.580 --> 27:49.780]  want to investigate a dolphin to see the genetic makeup of that dolphin nobody
[27:49.780 --> 27:55.220]  because that's stupid how many of you would say I want to see if this dolphin
[27:55.220 --> 27:59.700]  and that dolphin has a virus because it might be contagious and that's why all
[27:59.700 --> 28:05.500]  these dolphins are getting sick that fellow how many of you would say excuse
[28:05.500 --> 28:14.180]  my friends here somebody put some shit in the water here like Exxon Valdez
[28:14.180 --> 28:23.180]  anybody everybody because that's what happened and the cells get poisoned they
[28:23.180 --> 28:30.900]  try to purify themselves by excreting debris which we call viruses if you if
[28:30.900 --> 28:36.300]  you go to the current theory of viruses called exosomes and they come back and
[28:36.300 --> 28:40.500]  this is being adopted more and more it as a new theory because the old belief
[28:40.500 --> 28:44.820]  is just a theory as well none of this is settled that you get poisoned then these
[28:44.820 --> 28:50.020]  are put off and then you study someone and say oh look they had the virus killed
[28:50.020 --> 28:52.740]  them but no it was really that your immune system was run down you were
[28:52.740 --> 28:55.340]  smoking cigarettes and taking methamphetamine like most people the
[28:55.340 --> 29:01.100]  doubt of HIV or drug addicts we can all agree these are troubled times right so

[30:02.380 --> 30:09.540]  to destroy one thing confidence it's confidence in an economy confidence in
[30:09.540 --> 30:13.940]  a culture confidence in the direction the civilization and the people are
[30:13.940 --> 30:19.620]  going that causes people to work hard and believe in the future and invest its
[30:19.620 --> 30:24.060]  spirit and the entire media and the entire culture and all these multinational
[30:24.060 --> 30:29.100]  governments in the UN the WHO and the Chai comms in Hollywood have been having
[30:29.100 --> 30:35.700]  orgasmic delight over how plightly everyone has gotten into a state of
[30:35.700 --> 30:41.380]  fear yes the virus is real it's gonna be maybe double what the flu is normally
[30:41.380 --> 30:46.700]  and it's a bio weapon but a bio weapon the globalist to the trajectory of but
[30:46.700 --> 30:52.140]  it's real target is confidence in the economy and that's why recognizing that
[30:52.140 --> 30:55.820]  it's an attempt to scare us in a submission is critical because then
[30:55.820 --> 31:01.940]  people will understand the real paradigm one of our best-selling products is

[31:12.260 --> 31:15.620]  living defense to get it for yourself here just part of one testimonial I
[31:15.620 --> 31:20.100]  look in January 2016 I went in a hospital I went to VA hospital out here
[31:20.100 --> 31:23.540]  in Boyce and I was in there until June and one of the only things that got me
[31:23.540 --> 31:27.940]  through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day and I kept
[31:27.940 --> 31:31.380]  here in doctor group and all you guys talking about living defense let me
[31:31.380 --> 31:35.620]  tell you something man I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it
[31:35.620 --> 31:39.340]  for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every test nobody
[31:39.340 --> 31:42.420]  could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing you and
[31:42.420 --> 31:45.420]  doctor group and those commercials I said you know what I'm gonna get me some
[31:45.420 --> 31:47.820]  of that freaking living defense now I wasn't supposed to have any
[31:47.820 --> 31:50.660]  nutritional because they don't want you to have a stuff but I ordered it had
[31:50.660 --> 31:54.900]  accepted me I got it I hid it from the nurses I started taking it man that
[31:54.900 --> 32:00.180]  stuff changed my life it saved my life Alex Jones and info wars saved my life
[32:00.180 --> 32:04.340]  I'm here to tell you I don't need you to thank me and tell me I've done a good job
[32:04.340 --> 32:10.140]  I've done nothing but my duty I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming out
[32:10.140 --> 32:17.620]  they're innocent people and I've been psyched up for 13 years and I'll never stop while I'm growing breath
[32:17.620 --> 32:23.420]  for 26 years Alex Jones and info wars have been sounding the alarm for
[32:23.420 --> 32:28.820]  patriots worldwide waking people up to the new world order
[32:28.820 --> 32:37.380]  bohemian grove the American deep state the rise of communist China the plan for
[32:37.380 --> 32:44.940]  global depopulation and global elite pedophiles who pray off of our young the
[32:44.940 --> 32:49.820]  enemy has done their best to destroy us but because of your support our fight
[32:49.820 --> 32:57.060]  continues join us support the info war and together we will slay the dragon
[32:57.060 --> 33:06.780]  fighting out your gladiator you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:06.780 --> 33:31.540]  I'm Alex Jones your host and in front of me I have more than 200 articles
[33:31.540 --> 33:39.580]  documents mainline prestigious studies that 1g through 5g absolutely causes
[33:39.580 --> 33:45.820]  big increases in cancers in mice rats pigs and other mammals that has been
[33:45.820 --> 33:50.900]  tested on and now human studies are coming out showing the same thing and
[33:50.900 --> 33:55.700]  we're talking cataracts because it hits the eyes just like sunlight causes
[33:55.700 --> 34:02.580]  cataracts to sort of form a radiation you just can't see it that's why it's
[34:02.580 --> 34:08.300]  the perfect enemy so when you hear 1g 5g people think oh it's getting more
[34:08.300 --> 34:11.620]  powerful now these are all different technologies they're similar if that
[34:11.620 --> 34:18.180]  engineers on we've we've broken it down both engineers with degrees and the
[34:18.180 --> 34:23.780]  engineers they're installing it's all important from the bottom to the top and
[34:23.780 --> 34:29.180]  they'll tell you anybody that's a radio engineer that has degrees in it that the
[34:29.180 --> 34:35.340]  reason they stick the antennas for AM and FM especially big transmitters that
[34:35.340 --> 34:40.060]  are hundred thousand watts 50,000 watts out far away is because they started
[34:40.060 --> 34:45.420]  learning real quick people died and got cancer in their offices in the old days
[34:45.420 --> 34:49.420]  up until the 50s and stuff from the 20s into the 50s they would have them in the
[34:49.420 --> 34:54.660]  building and they try to put lead walls around them and stuff but it was still
[34:54.660 --> 35:00.700]  coming out of the antenna on top the building so again there's lots of things
[35:00.700 --> 35:06.340]  you can't see that are real there's nerve gas that's basically invisible it'll
[35:06.340 --> 35:14.140]  kill you and you can't see light when it's going through the atmosphere you
[35:14.140 --> 35:19.860]  only see light in dust or see light through through a filter while the sun
[35:19.860 --> 35:23.300]  looks red as it sets because you're looking at it through the oblique
[35:23.300 --> 35:28.300]  through the atmosphere and you're seeing dust like a lens but the sun's
[35:28.300 --> 35:34.420]  really just pure white what is white it's all of the colors being broadcast what
[35:34.420 --> 35:40.740]  is black the absence of light it's it's absorbing the colors that's only one
[35:40.740 --> 35:46.140]  small spectrum and so this is all blasting out and it's in the literature
[35:46.140 --> 35:50.940]  that it causes cancer well it does a lot more than that and that's in the
[35:50.940 --> 35:56.580]  literature the medical literature from the early days of radar in World War
[35:56.580 --> 36:02.260]  2 the guys would be freezing their asses off on the British coastline this is in
[36:02.260 --> 36:08.820]  mainland history books and they would sit on top the radar to warm themselves
[36:08.820 --> 36:14.500]  and they'd cook cans of beans cheese beans is what they call baked beans over
[36:14.500 --> 36:22.380]  there and all the sudden they'd get really really sick and they'd die in
[36:22.380 --> 36:27.860]  just a few weeks because they were cooked they were radiated until they started
[36:27.860 --> 36:31.100]  telling them danger I mean when you go to one of those radar installation this is
[36:31.100 --> 36:34.540]  dangerous stay back you go to one of the cell tower things it's got skull and
[36:34.540 --> 36:39.780]  crossbones saying cellular radiation stay back and the dudes that work on them
[36:39.780 --> 36:47.380]  will tell you they get sick because you're up close to them and in general
[36:47.380 --> 36:50.580]  talking to the engineers again if you have an antenna that's a three inches
[36:50.580 --> 36:56.300]  long it gives you the full power of that radiation for three inches now your six
[36:56.300 --> 37:02.580]  inches it dissipates by half and it just goes out from there continuing on I'll
[37:02.580 --> 37:05.900]  play a video in a moment when we come back in the next segment of all over the
[37:05.900 --> 37:09.460]  U.S. all over Europe all over everywhere it's going in South Korea there's
[37:09.460 --> 37:13.660]  videos you they're hidden in lampposts they're hidden in things that look like
[37:13.660 --> 37:21.580]  trees and the tree right next to it will start dying and the tree will then
[37:21.580 --> 37:25.300]  split and fall off on one side as it tries to live and then the other side
[37:25.300 --> 37:29.380]  dies we're gonna show you that don't want to get back to this video with the
[37:29.380 --> 37:33.780]  doctor medical doctor laying this out okay
[37:33.780 --> 37:38.860]  getting into virus theory and things but the point is then he gets into 5g so
[37:38.860 --> 37:43.540]  it's a fact and you can lay the maps we'll do next segment of the areas that
[37:43.540 --> 37:48.740]  have 5g in the areas that have all the disease and it's even in the studies that
[37:48.740 --> 37:52.820]  that's what it does it kills you and the system knows this and is doing it let's
[37:52.820 --> 38:01.180]  go back to the report and the cells get poisoned they try to purify
[38:01.180 --> 38:07.740]  themselves by excreting debris which we call viruses if you if you go to the
[38:07.740 --> 38:12.700]  current theory of viruses called exosomes in the latest head of the NIH
[38:12.700 --> 38:17.500]  giving a talk on the complexity of viruses you will see this is perfectly
[38:17.500 --> 38:23.380]  in line with the current thinking on what a virus really is I had a dramatic
[38:23.380 --> 38:27.660]  example of this when I was growing up out right outside our house there was a
[38:27.660 --> 38:32.580]  wetlands and they had full of frogs and the frogs kept me up at night so I taped
[38:32.580 --> 38:36.860]  the windows and they were in the spring it was they made a big racket and then
[38:36.860 --> 38:42.180]  over time the frogs were all gone how many thinks the virus the frogs had a
[38:42.180 --> 38:48.020]  genetic disease how many thinks the virus the frogs had a virus how many
[38:48.020 --> 38:54.820]  thinks somebody put DDT into the water that's what happened diseases are
[38:54.820 --> 39:00.780]  poisoning it's one of the reasons why vaccines so let me skip that for a minute
[39:00.780 --> 39:07.980]  so what happened in 1918 there was a huge in every every pandemic in the last
[39:07.980 --> 39:15.300]  hundred and fifty years there was an a quantum leap in the electrification of
[39:15.300 --> 39:23.580]  the earth in 1918 late late fall of 1917 there was the introduction of radio
[39:23.580 --> 39:31.260]  waves around the world whenever you expose any biological system to a new
[39:31.260 --> 39:37.940]  electromagnetic field you poison it you kill some and the rest go into a kind
[39:37.940 --> 39:42.660]  of suspended animation so that interestingly they live a little bit
[39:42.660 --> 39:49.140]  longer and sicker and then starts in World War two with the next pandemic with
[39:49.140 --> 39:54.860]  the introduction of radar equipment all over the earth blanketing the entire
[39:54.860 --> 40:03.460]  earth in radar fields and now look at cancer rates on average are more than
[40:03.460 --> 40:08.620]  10,000 times what they were in the 50s scientists would get on a plane to go
[40:08.620 --> 40:13.540]  across the country to see a child with brain cancer you go to a elementary
[40:13.540 --> 40:19.420]  school and you won't go to a event and there are kids their head shaved die of
[40:19.420 --> 40:25.660]  cancer every row we're dying we're all dead and the globalists know it and are
[40:25.660 --> 40:30.820]  doing it on purpose you have to understand this let's continue so that in
[40:30.820 --> 40:36.540]  1968 there was the Hong Kong flu and it was the first time the earth has a
[40:36.540 --> 40:43.620]  protective layer in the Van Allen belt which essentially integrates the cosmic
[40:43.620 --> 40:50.860]  fields from the Sun and the earth from the moon and Jupiter etc integrates that
[40:50.860 --> 40:56.620]  and essentially distributes that to the living beings of the earth and we put
[40:56.620 --> 41:01.180]  satellites emitting radioactive frequencies in the Van Allen belt
[41:01.180 --> 41:07.900]  within six months we had a new viral pandemic why viral because the people
[41:07.900 --> 41:13.500]  are poisoned they excrete toxins they look like viruses people think it's an
[41:13.500 --> 41:20.900]  it's a flu epidemic in the 1918 the epidemic the Boston Health Department
[41:20.900 --> 41:25.700]  decided to investigate the contagiousness of this so they believe it or not
[41:25.700 --> 41:30.020]  took hundreds of people with the flu and they sucked the snot out of their
[41:30.020 --> 41:35.020]  nose and injected it into the healthy people who didn't have the flu and not
[41:35.020 --> 41:41.540]  one time could they make the next person sick they did this over and over again
[41:41.540 --> 41:46.580]  and they were not able to demonstrate contagion they even did it with horses
[41:46.580 --> 41:50.540]  who apparently got the Spanish flu they put bags over their head and the
[41:50.540 --> 41:55.900]  horses sneezed in the bag and they put the bag over the next horse also he
[41:55.900 --> 41:59.780]  didn't tell you as about that on radiation belt the United States
[41:59.780 --> 42:07.020]  detonated an operation fishbowl hundreds total were done in different
[42:07.020 --> 42:14.260]  operations but more than 20 hydrogen bombs big ones in the Van Allen
[42:14.260 --> 42:19.580]  radiation belt trying to quote blow a hole through it and all it did was then
[42:19.580 --> 42:24.580]  damage and weaken the protective field that blocks most the radiation coming
[42:24.580 --> 42:28.780]  in I just got chills you don't just think the people running things did that on
[42:28.780 --> 42:35.980]  their own who do you think they're getting information from this so here's
[42:35.980 --> 42:39.940]  the deal we are an advanced species though but at a very primitive level
[42:39.940 --> 42:44.780]  right now and everyone is understanding this and this information's spreading
[42:44.780 --> 42:48.660]  right now and the good news is there's a global awakening and we're gonna beat
[42:48.660 --> 42:52.580]  this together but the 5g is the extermination grid of you and your
[42:52.580 --> 43:00.660]  family and it will kill you we knew early on the COVID-19 was an engineered
[43:00.660 --> 43:04.260]  bio weapon but again people say oh that it must be the most deadly thing ever
[43:04.260 --> 43:09.500]  no it does currently kill people but if you're gonna release a bio weapon for
[43:09.500 --> 43:14.100]  fear and to bankrupt an economy and cause panic and to run folks off the edge
[43:14.100 --> 43:17.500]  of a cliff and a giant artificial stampede you want to know the real
[43:17.500 --> 43:21.340]  trajectory kill a bunch of old people kill people that are deficient kill
[43:21.340 --> 43:24.980]  people that are already sick get rid of folks the global stone even want anyways
[43:24.980 --> 43:30.940]  but scare everybody else you want to control in to submission and that's
[43:30.940 --> 43:34.220]  what's going on so people get confused by the paradox of you say it's a real
[43:34.220 --> 43:37.860]  virus you say it's serious but you say don't panic and don't shut the economy
[43:37.860 --> 43:41.580]  down exactly because if you do that they're gonna keep releasing bio weapons
[43:41.580 --> 43:46.500]  over and over again because it works so well on the public most people are
[43:46.500 --> 43:50.500]  starting to wake up but we have to understand that pressures being put on
[43:50.500 --> 43:54.380]  Trump to basically keep the economy shut for other six months to a year we'll
[43:54.380 --> 43:58.020]  be in a depression long before then we've got to go back to work I don't
[43:58.020 --> 44:02.940]  want to sit here and say see I told you so so people say oh Alex Jones is so
[44:02.940 --> 44:08.060]  smart oh he's so great I can hear less about that I want you to understand that
[44:08.060 --> 44:14.780]  back in mid-January during a whole fake impeachment fiasco the rest of it I was
[44:14.780 --> 44:20.100]  pointing out that the biggest you would be the next move next time the globals
[44:20.100 --> 44:23.660]  were in walks they knew they didn't have the votes back in and I said would be
[44:23.660 --> 44:27.820]  an attack on the economy because criminals love to brag and they were
[44:27.820 --> 44:32.900]  telegraphing the entire thing and now here we are ladies and gentlemen our
[44:32.900 --> 44:36.660]  economy shut down for over a month certain depression if it continues for
[44:36.660 --> 44:42.780]  more than a month and a half or so maybe even shorter and Americans have failed
[44:42.780 --> 44:46.900]  the test they have gotten into the fear they've enjoyed not going into work it's
[44:46.900 --> 44:52.860]  been a new drama and the globals are saying hell must destroy their way of
[44:52.860 --> 44:56.020]  life forever let's kill their confidence and give them a depression people better
[44:56.020 --> 45:06.140]  wake up now allergies dander asthma germs toxins there are many reasons why we
[45:06.140 --> 45:09.980]  need to think about what is really in the air around us we may not be able to
[45:09.980 --> 45:13.740]  stop breathing but we can control what's in the air we breathe the
[45:13.740 --> 45:18.460]  revolutionary alexa pure breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in
[45:18.460 --> 45:23.180]  the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air powerful quiet

[45:27.780 --> 45:31.780]  breathe easier and cleaner similar systems could cost hundreds to even
[45:31.780 --> 45:36.500]  thousands of dollars but the alexa pure breeze air purification is the best and
[45:36.500 --> 45:41.220]  most affordable bar none the breeze in the ion cluster patented technology used

[46:45.380 --> 46:49.380]  mother nature has given us a lot of things that really help boost our
[46:49.380 --> 46:52.980]  overall health and wellness
[46:52.980 --> 47:06.220]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:22.980 --> 47:35.340]  we have massive breaking news happening in a live time I remember 14 15 years ago
[47:35.340 --> 47:41.220]  when Google put out a prospectus to shareholders saying we're now using the
[47:41.220 --> 47:45.540]  microphones that are on computers and the webcams to listen and watch people
[47:45.540 --> 47:49.860]  with AI and then we do advertisements targeting them we hear a dog barking and
[47:49.860 --> 47:54.340]  we put dog food ads on there well think of all the nefarious uses of that now it
[47:54.340 --> 47:58.260]  was in the New York Times you know a couple years ago oh Comey says he covers
[47:58.260 --> 48:04.140]  up the webcam on his computer and then of course people saw Zuckerberg's office
[48:04.140 --> 48:07.820]  and it was covered up I first said that 20 years ago you should cover it up but
[48:07.820 --> 48:13.860]  but but here's the point we knew from the Samsung you buy a new Samsung TV or
[48:13.860 --> 48:18.180]  any of them and it says we sell the audio of inside your house to third parties
[48:18.180 --> 48:22.620]  watch what you say and then it turns out Netflix does it and announced it last
[48:22.620 --> 48:31.580]  year and then last week the California State government and others told their
[48:31.580 --> 48:38.260]  employees turn your web assistants off like Alexa and all the rest of them in
[48:38.260 --> 48:45.460]  Google Google assistant because hackers and other governments and people are
[48:45.460 --> 48:57.340]  listening to you but what's really listening is AI what's really listening
[48:57.340 --> 49:03.820]  is AI I got a frantic call from my wife at 9 a.m. this morning and she said oh
[49:03.820 --> 49:08.860]  my god I was just talking to my family about 5g and how it's dangerous and I
[49:08.860 --> 49:13.940]  just got a Twitter message saying 5g is not bad for you it's not giving you the
[49:13.940 --> 49:23.380]  coronavirus I forgot about that
[49:24.100 --> 49:29.460]  yeah there's Bloomberg Bloomberg saying turn off your assistants if you're a
[49:29.460 --> 49:34.700]  government worker or a key person this is incredible they've done this to us but
[49:34.700 --> 49:38.860]  now they want to tell their people turn it off but it's your phone is the
[49:38.860 --> 49:44.860]  original one doing it I told people 20 years ago that it was in the telecommunications
[49:44.860 --> 49:51.980]  act of 96 to do just this AI small business startup hello Alice launches
[49:51.980 --> 49:57.140]  business for all campaign with influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow and others
[49:57.140 --> 50:07.060]  so what happened during the break earlier Friday April 3rd 1122
[50:07.060 --> 50:10.740]  Dr. McCam shot please and then we'll also show your Twitter on screen for
[50:10.740 --> 50:17.100]  folks Rob one of the great switchers and producers in there he was sent this
[50:17.100 --> 50:32.980]  message and what does it say news for you no 5g isn't causing coronavirus look
[50:32.980 --> 50:39.980]  up Twitter they got caught five years ago activating microphone they're
[50:39.980 --> 50:43.980]  listening to you AI's listening and heard all the discussion about it in there
[50:43.980 --> 50:54.780]  and AI sent him a message you understand now this technology could be neutral but
[50:54.780 --> 50:59.300]  it's not it's all built by this breakaway civilization this is a revolution
[50:59.300 --> 51:07.380]  it's like Westerners showed up with firearms and all the rest of it and it
[51:07.380 --> 51:12.060]  is true that Westerners it's in British field manuals British communications
[51:12.060 --> 51:16.780]  from the French and in war to give smallpox blankets that the troops that
[51:16.780 --> 51:19.940]  had smallpox to the natives who had never experienced it before so it would
[51:19.940 --> 51:23.540]  kill almost everybody might kill one percent of our people back then but it
[51:23.540 --> 51:32.580]  would kill 90% of the natives by a weapon now there's wired magazine 5g
[51:32.580 --> 51:35.780]  smartphones cause cancer big wireless is when you know that was for the total
[51:35.780 --> 51:41.660]  media takeover that was a few years ago now they're trying to spin it now they
[51:41.660 --> 51:46.020]  tell you oh it isn't no it doesn't cause coronavirus it pushes it into the cell
[51:46.020 --> 51:54.740]  and you can type in studies about 1g 2g 3g 4g 5g you know the earlier G's are
[51:54.740 --> 51:58.620]  actually stronger but they got to go further distances so they're not
[51:58.620 --> 52:05.220]  hammering you when you're a quarter mile away but when you're around 5g that is
[52:05.220 --> 52:09.060]  gonna blanket the entire nation already let's put a map on screen for TV viewers
[52:09.060 --> 52:13.980]  of AT&T I was AT&T this morning clicked on what their current coverage is and
[52:13.980 --> 52:18.740]  it's almost every road in Austin and by the end of the year it'll be all of
[52:18.740 --> 52:23.020]  Austin but all the major roads you are completely hammered if you look at maps
[52:23.020 --> 52:28.820]  of where you have 5g you see that on screen then you see the map of where
[52:28.820 --> 52:32.100]  you have all the coronavirus you say well that's anecdotal those are the big
[52:32.100 --> 52:36.940]  cities the point is is we have the studies about the immunity and that's
[52:36.940 --> 52:39.980]  our I'm gonna go over all this and great to tell the documents themselves but
[52:39.980 --> 52:45.320]  there's the real news by the way here it is coronavirus this is a silicon dot
[52:45.320 --> 52:52.100]  co.uk Google releases location data to help authorities check
[52:52.100 --> 52:57.540]  lockdowns yeah that's right when you have a lockdown and you don't have your
[52:57.540 --> 53:01.340]  approval to leave you're gonna get a Google app starting next year it's
[53:01.340 --> 53:06.340]  official in China they they chose the state-controlled Alibaba their Amazon
[53:06.340 --> 53:09.580]  there's gonna be approved corporations you get your app with or government app
[53:09.580 --> 53:13.220]  and then it tells you when you can go out what you can do just like they've
[53:13.220 --> 53:17.340]  been teaching school children for 15 years in the UK with the popular cartoon
[53:17.340 --> 53:23.420]  called mega-opolis and for people that were in elementary school seeing this
[53:23.420 --> 53:27.020]  15 years ago who are now 20 and becoming police officers it's totally normal
[53:27.020 --> 53:31.020]  they're an enforcer in mega-opolis and they've got robot helpers that'll kill
[53:31.020 --> 53:34.620]  you if you don't do what they say and I've got a stack of news on that
[53:34.620 --> 53:41.260]  Robocop enforces coronavirus lockdown Germans sit on neighbors plouting
[53:41.260 --> 53:45.980]  virus rules and echo of the Stasi past residents snitch on businesses neighbors
[53:45.980 --> 53:55.500]  amid shutdowns snitches get rewards and all the real snitches are all the big
[53:55.500 --> 53:59.660]  tech apps listen to you in live time and they then it's a it's a word document
[53:59.660 --> 54:07.340]  and when it hits a certain level if you're about 5g causing coronavirus it
[54:07.340 --> 54:11.300]  spits out the disinfo that it's causing it no it's exacerbating it in all the
[54:11.300 --> 54:16.020]  studies lowers your immune system helps viruses just look cell phone
[54:16.020 --> 54:20.580]  radiation lowers immunity helps viruses you get all the big studies but see
[54:20.580 --> 54:25.460]  Twitter is listening to you they're the superclass they're the breakaway
[54:25.460 --> 54:29.260]  civilization it's like the big steel beast showing up in the middle of
[54:29.260 --> 54:33.620]  Nebraska you know 160 years ago and the Indians tried to shoot arrows at it but
[54:33.620 --> 54:37.580]  they bounced off and that's the sick evil attitude of the big tech owners
[54:37.580 --> 54:41.180]  with the slave factories in China and all the evil because they're the
[54:41.180 --> 54:46.340]  annoyed ones they're gay to you know they're Tim Cook they're they're they
[54:46.340 --> 54:52.620]  they're allowed to because they deserve it they're good they're selfish they're
[54:52.620 --> 54:57.220]  the superclass and they're breaking away from all of us who needs mothers who
[54:57.220 --> 55:01.660]  needs fathers we can be a beautiful dragon as one Google high-level official
[55:01.660 --> 55:05.300]  said and everyone had to say you are a beautiful dragon he said I'm a beautiful
[55:05.300 --> 55:09.140]  golden building and they all chant you were a beautiful golden building Jim
[55:09.140 --> 55:13.060]  Jones couldn't get his people to do that and they're just the folks helping
[55:13.060 --> 55:19.300]  sweep humanity out but they're not bringing Christianity or things you
[55:19.300 --> 55:23.220]  could argue that was you know bad for the natives no they're bringing death and
[55:23.220 --> 55:27.780]  the post-human world and telling you that I'm gonna play the rest of the
[55:27.780 --> 55:33.060]  medical doctor where he gets into 5g and he gets into the facts that your body
[55:33.060 --> 55:38.340]  has to calibrate every time there's a new major electromagnetic system come in
[55:38.340 --> 55:43.860]  and you imagine what it's like to go from dark to super bright just with your
[55:43.860 --> 55:49.260]  eyes well imagine going out of 3g 4g 5g areas into 6g is already coming out and
[55:49.260 --> 55:53.700]  you're just being fried constantly and your children are and they have they
[55:53.700 --> 55:57.860]  put 5g in California on schools and then suddenly 10% of the kids will get
[55:57.860 --> 56:03.220]  cancer that's I've got newscasts that they would they would remove them that's
[56:03.220 --> 56:09.620]  why they hide them we're gonna show you trees dying and all over the world
[56:09.620 --> 56:12.660]  people are starting to burn the 5g mask they're shooting and they're tearing
[56:12.660 --> 56:18.740]  them down and just they think you're dumb and they're gonna lionize everybody
[56:18.740 --> 56:21.460]  when you have cancer and you're dying and ever say why is everybody got cancer
[56:21.460 --> 56:24.260]  all the sudden because they're just slowly getting used to all of it they're
[56:24.260 --> 56:29.500]  murdering you with leisure and Bill Gates and all of them have redoubts in the
[56:29.500 --> 56:33.620]  countryside Zuckerberg all of they don't stay in cities and they're getting a
[56:33.620 --> 56:38.900]  little towns to pass laws no 5g no 4g because they're there they've all got
[56:38.900 --> 56:42.260]  wired I mean if you're at these globalist houses I thought folks that are in
[56:42.260 --> 56:45.300]  there security go yeah Jones you're right they've all got super fast fiber
[56:45.300 --> 56:50.140]  optic way better than 5g 6g they all plug into fiber optic then they'll have a
[56:50.140 --> 56:56.100]  satellite uplink to a satellite in the backyard high power they don't get their
[56:56.100 --> 57:02.860]  kids near this the inventor of Apple the creator of Apple Steve Jobs wouldn't let
[57:02.860 --> 57:08.700]  his children have the iPad he said hell no it brain damages them you can also
[57:08.700 --> 57:12.940]  fight back with nutrients and vitamins and minerals where your body can kick
[57:12.940 --> 57:16.900]  these viruses out but how do you kick the electromagnetic radiation out ladies
[57:16.900 --> 57:22.380]  and gentlemen we're all being murdered and it's a fact and I'm gonna lay it all
[57:22.380 --> 57:25.660]  out next hour with the scientists with the newscliffs with the proof with all
[57:25.660 --> 57:28.860]  of it and I want to remind all the people that attack this broadcast will
[57:28.860 --> 57:31.860]  take it off air you're getting murdered too by your globalist bosses and you're
[57:31.860 --> 57:34.780]  only pretending mentally that you're on the winning team you're on the losing
[57:34.780 --> 57:38.940]  team because the globalist may be able to kill this body and play God but there
[57:38.940 --> 57:41.900]  is a higher order and all of you that have joined the satanic
[57:41.900 --> 57:46.780]  anti-human operation are going to be punished because your spirit is eternal
[57:46.780 --> 57:51.980]  when the globalist and the mainstream media and the big box store zig we say

[59:46.500 --> 1:00:08.020]  you're listening to the alex jones show emergency 5g news briefing now live
[1:00:08.020 --> 1:00:13.380]  secret rollout of 5g systems nationwide confirmed I haven't gotten all the news
[1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:16.980]  I'm gonna hit all the news next segment and then I'm gonna get into the emergency
[1:00:16.980 --> 1:00:21.180]  global news briefing for 45 minutes coming up about 15 minutes let's go
[1:00:21.180 --> 1:00:31.140]  back to medical doctor Thomas Kalman where he's laying out that it poisons in
[1:00:31.140 --> 1:00:35.580]  the environment and electromagnetic poisoning that is been linked directly
[1:00:35.580 --> 1:00:41.060]  to the cells being more easily affected and bombarded by viruses that
[1:00:41.060 --> 1:00:45.820]  themselves are a disgorgement of toxins from the mitochondria of our species and
[1:00:45.820 --> 1:00:51.860]  many others here it is so that in 1968 there was the Hong Kong flu and it was
[1:00:51.860 --> 1:00:56.540]  the first time the earth has a protective layer in the van allen belt
[1:00:56.540 --> 1:01:04.780]  which essentially integrates the cosmic fields from the sun and the earth from
[1:01:04.780 --> 1:01:11.260]  the moon and Jupiter etc integrates that and essentially distributes that to the
[1:01:11.260 --> 1:01:17.340]  living beings of the earth and we put satellites emitting radioactive frequencies
[1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:24.180]  in the van allen belt within six months we had a new viral pandemic why viral
[1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:29.500]  because the people are poisoned they excrete toxins they look like viruses
[1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:37.500]  people think it's an it's a flu epidemic in the 1918 the epidemic the Boston
[1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:42.300]  Health Department decided to investigate the contagiousness of this so they
[1:01:42.300 --> 1:01:46.580]  believe it or not took hundreds of people with the flu and they suck the
[1:01:46.580 --> 1:01:51.220]  snot out of their nose and injected it into the healthy people who didn't have
[1:01:51.220 --> 1:01:58.100]  the flu and not one time could they make the next person sick they did this over
[1:01:58.100 --> 1:02:03.380]  and over again and they were not able to demonstrate contagion they even did it
[1:02:03.380 --> 1:02:07.420]  with horses who apparently got the Spanish flu they put bags over their
[1:02:07.420 --> 1:02:11.420]  head and the horses sneezed in the bag and they put the bag over the next horse
[1:02:11.420 --> 1:02:16.020]  and not one horse got sick you can read about this in a book called the
[1:02:16.020 --> 1:02:22.340]  invisible rainbow by Arthur firstenberg who chronicles all the steps in the
[1:02:22.340 --> 1:02:28.020]  electrification of the earth and how within six months there was a new flu
[1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:33.180]  pandemic all over the world and when you invest it when you hear that normal
[1:02:33.180 --> 1:02:39.300]  explanations how did it go from Kansas to South Africa in two weeks so the
[1:02:39.300 --> 1:02:44.220]  entire world got the symptoms at the same time in spite of the fact that the
[1:02:44.220 --> 1:02:49.940]  mode of transportation was horseback and boats and there's no explanation for
[1:02:49.940 --> 1:02:54.700]  it they just say we don't know how that happened but when you think about it with
[1:02:54.700 --> 1:02:58.900]  these radio waves and other frequencies that some of you have in your
[1:02:58.900 --> 1:03:03.900]  pocket and on your wrist you can send a signal to Japan and it arrives
[1:03:03.900 --> 1:03:08.700]  instantaneously so any of you who don't believe there is an electromagnetic
[1:03:08.700 --> 1:03:15.300]  field that communicates globally within seconds just is not paying attention to
[1:03:15.300 --> 1:03:21.860]  this and I will only finish by pointing out that there has been a dramatic and
[1:03:21.860 --> 1:03:27.700]  quantum leap in the last six months with the electrification of the earth and
[1:03:27.700 --> 1:03:32.020]  I'm sure a lot of you know what that is it's called 5g where they're now have
[1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:39.100]  20,000 radiation emitting satellites just like the radiation emitting thing in
[1:03:39.100 --> 1:03:43.700]  your pocket and on your wrist and that you use all the time that is not
[1:03:43.700 --> 1:03:50.700]  compatible with health I'm sorry to say it it's not compatible with health that
[1:03:50.700 --> 1:03:56.500]  is a water destructuring device and for any of you who say yeah well we're not
[1:03:56.500 --> 1:04:03.020]  electrical beings we're just physical matter then don't bother doing an EKG or
[1:04:03.020 --> 1:04:09.860]  an EEG or a nerve conduction test because we are electrical beings and the
[1:04:09.860 --> 1:04:12.940]  chemicals are not there I'm gonna come back in the last couple minutes on the
[1:04:12.940 --> 1:04:15.620]  other side then get into the news and reports but you know you have the old
[1:04:15.620 --> 1:04:19.140]  factory that's the nose you have the auditory the nose picks up smell
[1:04:19.140 --> 1:04:24.780]  chemicals things the environment your ear picks up sound waves okay then you
[1:04:24.780 --> 1:04:29.300]  have taste and touch these are the ways you see the universe well imagine the
[1:04:29.300 --> 1:04:33.340]  electromagnetic stuff going on you think a dog whistles bad some of us have
[1:04:33.340 --> 1:04:37.260]  that higher-level hearing I do by this dog whistle I don't really hear it it
[1:04:37.260 --> 1:04:40.420]  just irritates me because it's at that level my grandmother had that I guess a
[1:04:40.420 --> 1:04:44.420]  genetic thing we can hear really high frequency well imagine your body's
[1:04:44.420 --> 1:04:49.220]  picking all this up it's like bang bang bang bang bang bang just all this hit my cells
[1:04:49.220 --> 1:04:52.780]  and the globalists know damn well they've tested it all and they're just
[1:04:52.780 --> 1:04:56.220]  torturing the hell out of everybody
[1:04:58.940 --> 1:05:05.820]  listen there's a show from PBS called it's okay to be smart so everyone who's
[1:05:05.820 --> 1:05:12.540]  been smart and has been put down for it and persecuted it's okay to finally be
[1:05:12.540 --> 1:05:17.540]  smart that's right there's not two sexes and and families are bad and the right
[1:05:17.540 --> 1:05:21.060]  thing to do is to sterilize your son so he doesn't become an evil warmonger I
[1:05:21.060 --> 1:05:23.540]  mean a lot of feminists are saying we should have the government passed laws
[1:05:23.540 --> 1:05:27.340]  that now embryos are killed but what's better and more reformed and more
[1:05:27.340 --> 1:05:30.980]  humanitarian is just to convince them when they're five years old and their
[1:05:30.980 --> 1:05:34.740]  testicles chopped off and again global warming is real we got to pay Lord
[1:05:34.740 --> 1:05:37.820]  Rothschild all of our money and the pandemic's all real we've got to be
[1:05:37.820 --> 1:05:41.940]  locked up in our houses we've got to use the language the university say we're
[1:05:41.940 --> 1:05:47.460]  not a culture anything oh no no we're not we're good people we're good people
[1:05:47.460 --> 1:05:51.940]  that went to these corporate systems that didn't brainwash us no no they
[1:05:51.940 --> 1:05:57.620]  enlightened us how to censor and how to rule and out of control
[1:05:57.620 --> 1:06:14.220]  the earth is in the midst of a great evolution but not all evolution is
[1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:22.780]  towards stronger and smarter or virtuous this is a devolution an entropy
[1:06:22.780 --> 1:06:29.700]  accelerated artificially a mass culling now I'm gonna finish up with this
[1:06:29.700 --> 1:06:33.860]  medical doctor laying out historical facts that people get poisoned and
[1:06:33.860 --> 1:06:38.020]  they're way more susceptible to viruses and that the reason we get viruses from
[1:06:38.020 --> 1:06:43.980]  our species is that it's known that we then disgorge viruses and they can also
[1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:49.300]  spread through the cells and then other cells disgorge the viruses as a deep
[1:06:49.300 --> 1:06:57.660]  toxification process and so they go find big schools dolphins they're dead and
[1:06:57.660 --> 1:07:01.740]  the first thing is it must be a virus and they do find a virus in all of them
[1:07:01.740 --> 1:07:07.540]  but then it turns out there was a toxic waste dump the Exxon Valdez and that
[1:07:07.540 --> 1:07:12.260]  they picked up the chemicals in the food chain from the fish and that then the
[1:07:12.260 --> 1:07:17.500]  viruses could replicate and kill them you can argue which comes first the
[1:07:17.500 --> 1:07:23.340]  chicken of the egg but the toxin is always the precursor and the bacteria
[1:07:23.340 --> 1:07:30.180]  are carrying it around but you see the mainstream media not wanting to know
[1:07:30.180 --> 1:07:37.100]  about zinc hydroxychloroquine vitamin C vitamin D why did they try to block all
[1:07:37.100 --> 1:07:40.860]  that because they want you absolutely scared and they want you to get ready
[1:07:40.860 --> 1:07:45.820]  and it was wound on province that first put in 5g two years ago now they have
[1:07:45.820 --> 1:07:51.580]  6g and you can look type it in any search engine Google try to bury it but
[1:07:51.580 --> 1:07:57.100]  it but it's there cell phone radiation lowers immunity all the different types
[1:07:57.100 --> 1:08:02.620]  and helps push viruses into the cells and it breaks up the DNA of the cells
[1:08:02.620 --> 1:08:06.580]  which causes cancer and I'm gonna show you all the mainstream news admitting
[1:08:06.580 --> 1:08:13.780]  that but I want to finish up with Dr. Thomas Cowan MD he's a prestigious guy
[1:08:13.780 --> 1:08:22.740]  and him laying out the fact that 5g is absolutely tired of this and as we have
[1:08:22.740 --> 1:08:26.980]  more artificial electromagnetic radiation right those the sun burns you
[1:08:26.980 --> 1:08:33.940]  well this stuff's doing a lot of other things here's this conclusion because we
[1:08:33.940 --> 1:08:39.060]  are electrical beings and the chemicals are only the byproduct of those
[1:08:39.060 --> 1:08:44.260]  electrical impulses and I'll finish with anybody want to make one guess is to
[1:08:44.260 --> 1:08:54.540]  where the first completely blanketed 5g city in the world was exactly so when
[1:08:54.540 --> 1:09:01.220]  you start thinking about this we are in an existential crisis here folks the
[1:09:01.220 --> 1:09:06.780]  likes of which humankind has never seen and I don't want to go all Old Testament
[1:09:06.780 --> 1:09:14.700]  profit on you but this is something that is unprecedented the the pudding of a
[1:09:14.700 --> 1:09:24.220]  hundred thousand satellites in the very blanket of the earth and by the way as I
[1:09:24.220 --> 1:09:28.100]  was going to say earlier this actually has something to do with the vaccine
[1:09:28.100 --> 1:09:32.980]  question and this got brought home to me because about a year ago or so I had a
[1:09:32.980 --> 1:09:37.500]  patient who came in who was totally fine a surfer and all of any brokers he works
[1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:42.060]  as an electrician putting in Wi-Fi systems for very wealthy people
[1:09:42.060 --> 1:09:47.540]  electricians have a very high mortality rate but he was fine and then he breaks
[1:09:47.540 --> 1:09:52.300]  his arm and he gets a metal plate put in his arm three months later he couldn't
[1:09:52.300 --> 1:10:00.300]  get out of bed and was total you know heart irregularities just total collapse
[1:10:00.300 --> 1:10:06.780]  the susceptibility has to do with how much metal you have in your body as well
[1:10:06.780 --> 1:10:12.340]  as the quality of the water in your cells so if you start injecting aluminum
[1:10:12.340 --> 1:10:18.740]  in people they become receptors for absorbing increased electromagnetic
[1:10:18.740 --> 1:10:27.660]  fields and that is a perfect storm for the kind of deterioration of the species
[1:10:27.660 --> 1:10:33.220]  which is what we're now experiencing and I'm just gonna finish with one more
[1:10:33.220 --> 1:10:37.420]  thing which I like to is a quote from Rudolf Steiner and by the way this was
[1:10:37.420 --> 1:10:44.980]  around 1917 so it was a different time in times when there were no electrical
[1:10:44.980 --> 1:10:51.700]  currents when the air was not swarming with electrical in flu influences we're
[1:10:51.700 --> 1:11:00.100]  talking 1917 it was easier to be human for this reason in order to be human at
[1:11:00.100 --> 1:11:07.460]  all today it is necessary to expend much stronger spiritual capacities than was
[1:11:07.460 --> 1:11:14.500]  necessary a century ago so I just leave you with whatever you can do to increase
[1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:19.420]  your spiritual capacities because it's really damn hard to be human being
[1:11:19.420 --> 1:11:24.460]  these days now that's been going massively viral for two weeks everybody's
[1:11:24.460 --> 1:11:28.780]  trying to get me to play it I already knew all that so when people told me to
[1:11:28.780 --> 1:11:33.660]  watch it I just didn't watch it now that's not a form of arrogance it's that
[1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:37.660]  I already know all this and then I tend to forget that just as we covered this
[1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:41.620]  20 years ago and 10 years ago and five years ago people are ready for it now
[1:11:41.620 --> 1:11:46.340]  and all the studies show that when you have a spiritual connection to the
[1:11:46.340 --> 1:11:49.900]  creator that's not black magic lower level energy stuff and I don't want to
[1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:52.540]  get new agey but just for everybody in general the studies across the world
[1:11:52.540 --> 1:11:55.900]  people that are positive that believe in a creator that one do good that you know
[1:11:55.900 --> 1:12:02.620]  are connecting to that who aren't falling they live longer they're happier
[1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:07.940]  they recover four five six seven ten times better from illnesses that they're
[1:12:07.940 --> 1:12:15.140]  not as sick and when you say spiritual it just means you're tying into the
[1:12:15.140 --> 1:12:21.500]  energy of the universe and God and saying help me because the globalists
[1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:25.860]  know about all this and they're trying to cut you off from God and the literal
[1:12:25.860 --> 1:12:31.180]  transmission God is the universe and God created the universe but we're God's
[1:12:31.180 --> 1:12:34.980]  creations that God is experiencing the universe at another level through we're
[1:12:34.980 --> 1:12:40.740]  not God but we're made in the image of God little G and boy through the modern
[1:12:40.740 --> 1:12:44.780]  preachers and the Catholic Church and the Protestants don't want you to know
[1:12:44.780 --> 1:12:50.660]  that they say that's devil worship but Jesus said you don't go to the big
[1:12:50.660 --> 1:12:53.820]  synagogue or up on the hill and tell people how close to God you are and
[1:12:53.820 --> 1:12:57.100]  dump your chest and be into all these rules and all this stuff that's the
[1:12:57.100 --> 1:13:00.460]  priesthood keep you from God you pray to God in the middle of the night on your
[1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:06.580]  knees and you have that connection because the temple's in you that's Jesus
[1:13:06.580 --> 1:13:12.900]  Christ and then you've got the whole eastern thing with the yogis and all
[1:13:12.900 --> 1:13:15.860]  that that's another deception I'm not attacking all those people the point is
[1:13:15.860 --> 1:13:20.540]  is that Christ and that cosmology is the accurate information and the enemy
[1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:25.820]  hates it they hate Jesus they hate the New Testament ladies and gentlemen the
[1:13:25.820 --> 1:13:34.500]  Old Testament is a history of what was going on and man be influenced and you'll
[1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:39.460]  by God to write those histories but the the New Testament is a whole other
[1:13:39.460 --> 1:13:44.500]  animal and the profane can't even read it or understand it I only in the last
[1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:48.300]  few years when I read it now it's like whoa absolute the code of the universe
[1:13:48.300 --> 1:13:53.500]  and and it's real crisis real jacked into a human body God came down here God
[1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:58.380]  can't put us through all this and then not do it himself so that's why they
[1:13:58.380 --> 1:14:03.460]  made the movie avatar is is is is there's nobody there atheists anymore in
[1:14:03.460 --> 1:14:07.460]  Hollywood defective ever were folks that's just to get you cut off from the
[1:14:07.460 --> 1:14:11.500]  bigger universe you only see a limited spectrum but you you internally in your
[1:14:11.500 --> 1:14:15.860]  soul see it all and can and and once you begin to contact that information and
[1:14:15.860 --> 1:14:21.580]  ask God's lead got to direct you then it just absolutely opens up and
[1:14:21.580 --> 1:14:26.860]  everything the globalists are doing is about blocking that I'm not attacking
[1:14:26.860 --> 1:14:29.500]  Catholics or Protestants or you know folks a lot of great people there and
[1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:33.220]  they get it they love Jesus I'm saying though it's all how you're bad and you
[1:14:33.220 --> 1:14:37.660]  suck and you have to do what we say to be good and then political correctness
[1:14:37.660 --> 1:14:40.180]  instead of you really love God you connected to God you'll start being a
[1:14:40.180 --> 1:14:49.340]  good person regardless and the evil will start not having power over you you'll
[1:14:49.340 --> 1:14:54.340]  still be fleshly we're all still falling but you don't need these big
[1:14:54.340 --> 1:14:57.540]  institutions and and they're all gonna tell you to take the mark of the beach
[1:14:57.540 --> 1:15:00.540]  they're all telling you take your vaccines almost all these churches are
[1:15:00.540 --> 1:15:05.020]  shutting down and doing they're told the ones that don't get arrested and I got a
[1:15:05.020 --> 1:15:07.660]  hand to the Muslims they're not backing down they're not letting people shut
[1:15:07.660 --> 1:15:11.460]  them down but but but this is a global martial law system and the countries all
[1:15:11.460 --> 1:15:14.540]  want power and they all want control and the billionaires are all getting big
[1:15:14.540 --> 1:15:21.980]  bailouts to go along with it and it is the end of the human era post human era
[1:15:21.980 --> 1:15:36.700]  P he post human era or after human era a he that's what it is so this is it this
[1:15:36.700 --> 1:15:39.900]  is the end of humanity if you don't stand up and realize it and make the
[1:15:39.900 --> 1:15:46.100]  spiritual connection because the truth is as the enemy moves with this God's
[1:15:46.100 --> 1:15:51.180]  power just increased massively pouring in the Satanists are shaking in fear right

[1:18:15.740 --> 1:18:20.940]  pharma and the entire lovelest operation is a kill grid and the studies are
[1:18:20.940 --> 1:18:25.580]  clear the average person is in a dreamlike state a near dreamlike day
[1:18:25.580 --> 1:18:30.340]  dream world program of the flicker rates of the televisions and all the
[1:18:30.340 --> 1:18:37.060]  screens we are in a trance and now they're turning up the power of the
[1:18:37.060 --> 1:18:42.060]  ambient electromagnetic radiation which again all the studies conclusively show
[1:18:42.060 --> 1:18:48.060]  cause massive cancer and destroy your immune system and push viruses across
[1:18:48.060 --> 1:18:53.220]  the cell membrane we are being murdered and I'm gonna tell you it's very
[1:18:53.220 --> 1:18:59.940]  sophisticated and looks not human as bad as things are with now more than half
[1:18:59.940 --> 1:19:04.620]  the world population under martial law being directed by the UN there is a
[1:19:04.620 --> 1:19:09.540]  master of awakening happening to the tyranny of big pharma and the medical
[1:19:09.540 --> 1:19:14.620]  mafia the forced inoculations of the UN admitting that vaccines are killing
[1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:18.860]  people and they've covered it up and everywhere I go I am just mobbed by
[1:19:18.860 --> 1:19:23.420]  folks on the street now even in leftist Austin who used to attack me just a few
[1:19:23.420 --> 1:19:29.180]  years ago saying you were right about 5g 5g's killing us I looked it up it's
[1:19:29.180 --> 1:19:34.300]  causing cancer it destroys immunity it says that it makes it easier for viruses
[1:19:34.300 --> 1:19:40.140]  to attack people are really starting to wake up and they know they're under
[1:19:40.140 --> 1:19:46.020]  attack at a spiritual and subconscious cellular level so now my friends
[1:19:46.020 --> 1:19:50.460]  educate everyone you know they're ready to listen they're ready to learn
[1:19:50.460 --> 1:19:56.540]  they're ready to take action I'm Alex Jones and this is the info war
[1:19:56.540 --> 1:20:14.660]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:26.580 --> 1:20:31.580]  well it's now all official your smart phones your assistants are listening to
[1:20:31.580 --> 1:20:38.020]  you and if you're talking about 5g lowering your immunity and helping the
[1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:41.100]  coronavirus kill you which is the most viral thing out there ever people are
[1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:45.620]  awakening I said the studies is true suddenly your phone pops up and says
[1:20:45.620 --> 1:20:49.660]  it's not true happened to Rob one of the producers last hour we're getting calls
[1:20:49.660 --> 1:20:54.660]  and emails it's happening to other people people go is it true yes I showed
[1:20:54.660 --> 1:20:58.900]  you Bloomberg your cell phones the assistants are listening to you and
[1:20:58.900 --> 1:21:04.620]  corporate apps are sending messages they're now going into the phase of
[1:21:04.620 --> 1:21:12.300]  drones telling you what to do robots on the streets the Garmin and other GPS
[1:21:12.300 --> 1:21:17.820]  systems are asking people now they get their cars are you allowed to be driving
[1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:29.220]  and soon you'll have to enter a code to drive proving you're allowed to you say
[1:21:29.220 --> 1:21:32.940]  well I'll just get an old car well in the cops will know we've got it unmarked
[1:21:32.940 --> 1:21:37.860]  just pulling over to make sure notice why you like watch an old Bronco I really
[1:21:37.860 --> 1:21:41.220]  like it well next year the law goes in you'll have to retrofit it with the
[1:21:41.220 --> 1:21:45.420]  tracker system you understand as far as safety don't you yeah officers are your
[1:21:45.420 --> 1:21:49.940]  children doing well I had three to have died but it's all right what they died
[1:21:49.940 --> 1:21:54.060]  well they you know they died we're not sure some of the crazies think it's the
[1:21:54.060 --> 1:21:58.620]  vaccines but you know we're standing firm and that couple shoot his next
[1:21:58.620 --> 1:22:04.420]  get up and put them in a pine box and piss on it because they're followers they
[1:22:04.420 --> 1:22:10.580]  want to kill their children that's what Satanists do every ancient culture got
[1:22:10.580 --> 1:22:13.420]  taken over by the Satan cult and they build an altar and they burn their
[1:22:13.420 --> 1:22:21.420]  kids and just use a cop as the bad guy there I'm seeing the enforcers and so
[1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:30.180]  you will die and your children will die because the cancer rates are going
[1:22:30.180 --> 1:22:35.380]  straight up the IQs are going straight down how long we live is going down
[1:22:35.380 --> 1:22:40.460]  we're being murdered we're being murdered we're being murdered we're being
[1:22:40.460 --> 1:22:44.300]  murdered we're being murdered so I said it's the live feed on info wars.com we
[1:22:44.300 --> 1:22:52.220]  have emergency news press briefing on what's happening in the world and I
[1:22:52.220 --> 1:22:58.380]  will be a good boy and I will go to that briefing starting next segment and I
[1:22:58.380 --> 1:23:02.660]  will be judicious and I will show you all the 5g proof that I've been talking
[1:23:02.660 --> 1:23:06.620]  about not just playing clips of medical doctors telling you about it as well and
[1:23:06.620 --> 1:23:10.860]  we will lay it all out but you know there's another viral video with
[1:23:10.860 --> 1:23:15.780]  millions of views online of a 5g executive that I want to play here in a
[1:23:15.780 --> 1:23:24.860]  moment and if you have Reuters or the LA Times or Wired magazine saying here's a
[1:23:24.860 --> 1:23:32.100]  bunch of studies where 5g gave rats cancer at a huge rate no one cares about
[1:23:32.100 --> 1:23:40.220]  that but if it's an anonymous guy then in millions of views everyone believes it
[1:23:40.220 --> 1:23:45.020]  and then the guy sounds credible and what he's saying is true in the studies
[1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:50.940]  but it's this crazy thing where if it's not totally proven then everyone like
[1:23:50.940 --> 1:23:55.140]  hey that hospital ship has secretly George Soros and Hillary arrested on it
[1:23:55.140 --> 1:24:01.340]  so the guy tries to ram a train in there for a cube and of course it's really a
[1:24:01.340 --> 1:24:07.900]  hospital ship see that's how it works the totally admitted stuff like thousands
[1:24:07.900 --> 1:24:11.740]  of declassified lethal studies that the US government did on children and
[1:24:11.740 --> 1:24:16.100]  minorities and people oh well no one cares about total admissions of that or
[1:24:16.100 --> 1:24:19.940]  total admissions of animal human clones in China that's like we don't even care
[1:24:19.940 --> 1:24:25.740]  about that or the cancer rates you know 10,000 plus percent in children from what
[1:24:25.740 --> 1:24:30.660]  it was 60 years ago no one cares about that it's all some nebulous thing then
[1:24:30.660 --> 1:24:34.660]  it that's what's crazy about this and I'm trying to figure out human psychology
[1:24:34.660 --> 1:24:38.100]  because I just go with the straight facts and see people can't deal with that
[1:24:38.100 --> 1:24:40.980]  hey there's a Rockefeller Foundation planned 10 years ago to have a
[1:24:40.980 --> 1:24:43.860]  coronavirus be released and bring in world government they use the word
[1:24:43.860 --> 1:24:47.380]  authoritarianism and lock everybody in their houses and in the industrial world
[1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:56.060]  as we know it then reduce the population it's called lockstep total proof but who
[1:24:56.060 --> 1:24:59.220]  cares about that right eco science written by the White House science are
[1:24:59.220 --> 1:25:04.620]  saying do all this 40 years ago well let's just go to the whistleblower clip
[1:25:04.620 --> 1:25:07.340]  and then we'll come back with all the documents of the admissions and the
[1:25:07.340 --> 1:25:11.820]  total proof not speculation but if you want speculation we'll give it to you
[1:25:11.820 --> 1:25:18.340]  here it is I was the head of the largest business unit at Vodafone their
[1:25:18.340 --> 1:25:26.660]  headquarters in Newbury between 2040 2013 to 2015 I was privy to a number of
[1:25:26.660 --> 1:25:29.900]  the new technologies that were coming down the pipe that was going to be
[1:25:29.900 --> 1:25:36.340]  implemented namely the Internet of Things and secondly the 5G technology
[1:25:36.340 --> 1:25:39.860]  what they're doing is spreading it to people via the testing sorry to be
[1:25:39.860 --> 1:25:43.340]  honest but that's what's happening so when you're tested it gives them an
[1:25:43.340 --> 1:25:48.220]  opportunity to contaminate you with the virus because they want to cover up
[1:25:48.220 --> 1:25:53.100]  I had a stack two inches tall yesterday I forgot to bring in when you guys pull
[1:25:53.100 --> 1:25:56.900]  the stack ways of mainstream news mainstream government mainstream
[1:25:56.900 --> 1:26:01.900]  testing firm saying China purposely ship them contaminated mask and the prick
[1:26:01.900 --> 1:26:07.180]  test so would give it to you see see that's the problem is I literally again
[1:26:07.180 --> 1:26:11.180]  I've had family come me with this video going this guy says they contaminated
[1:26:11.180 --> 1:26:17.260]  the equipment it's admitted but see oh I don't care about a stack of admissions
[1:26:17.260 --> 1:26:22.620]  named companies who got it who was given it how they're doing it on purpose
[1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:27.260]  how the World Health Organization is running it for China how they're
[1:26:27.260 --> 1:26:32.780]  bringing back train loads of dirty masks to give to LA and to Dallas and to
[1:26:32.780 --> 1:26:39.580]  Boston and New York and of course the trend then everyone's gonna get it my
[1:26:39.580 --> 1:26:46.700]  god how ridiculous is this getting but again and I'm not mad at this guy I
[1:26:46.700 --> 1:26:49.180]  think this is a real video he sounds very credible and everything he's saying
[1:26:49.180 --> 1:26:57.020]  is true my thing is go public the time for being scared over acting like a
[1:26:57.020 --> 1:27:01.020]  bunch of whips got us in this situation
[1:27:04.580 --> 1:27:11.980]  I'm not going down without a fight let's finish it
[1:27:11.980 --> 1:27:16.940]  5G technology what they're doing is spreading it to people via the testing
[1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:20.700]  sorry to be honest but that's what's happening so when you're tested it gives
[1:27:20.700 --> 1:27:25.180]  them an opportunity to contaminate you with the virus because they want to
[1:27:25.180 --> 1:27:29.580]  cover up the fact that millions of people will die from the excessive radio
[1:27:29.580 --> 1:27:34.540]  frequency radiation so basically that's what's occurring
[1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:38.620]  unfortunately so where is this going why are they doing this we know the
[1:27:38.620 --> 1:27:45.500]  technological reasons for it they need a robust scalable fast capable internet
[1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:48.940]  that can handle the metadata of information about all of your
[1:27:48.940 --> 1:27:52.620]  movements all of your journeys all of your banking transactions
[1:27:52.620 --> 1:27:57.260]  your identification all the cctv cameras around the world
[1:27:57.260 --> 1:28:00.540]  etc etc because they need visibility and what everyone's doing
[1:28:00.540 --> 1:28:03.900]  and they need it for all the robot cars and robot enforcers and they want to
[1:28:03.900 --> 1:28:06.460]  kill you with it and then once they track everything they
[1:28:06.460 --> 1:28:09.260]  can kill the underground economy and make living and having children
[1:28:09.260 --> 1:28:15.660]  impossible it's the post human era post human era after human era
[1:28:15.660 --> 1:28:20.620]  coined here but actually globals battle plans state that
[1:28:20.620 --> 1:28:23.900]  basically in that context okay we're gonna break i'm gonna come back and i'm
[1:28:23.900 --> 1:28:28.140]  gonna be a good boy cover the news i'm gonna show it all to you and how

[1:32:06.620 --> 1:32:10.300]  i did extensive searches online with different search engines i
[1:32:10.300 --> 1:32:14.620]  i did a bunch of research looking at different tv archives and i couldn't
[1:32:14.620 --> 1:32:19.180]  find hardly anything except a couple local news stories with medical
[1:32:19.180 --> 1:32:24.940]  doctors on there talking about zinc zinc zinc the element
[1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:28.460]  on the periodic table that is essential to life
[1:32:28.460 --> 1:32:34.860]  and that is the most antiviral natural compound out there in thousands and
[1:32:34.860 --> 1:32:38.860]  thousands of studies by the most prestigious universities
[1:32:38.860 --> 1:32:43.020]  including big studies on the coronavirus family
[1:32:43.020 --> 1:32:46.780]  so do yourself a favor search engine zinc
[1:32:46.780 --> 1:32:53.820]  and antiviral three words zinc antiviral zinc antiviral do yourself a
[1:32:53.820 --> 1:32:57.420]  favor zinc antiviral
[1:32:58.940 --> 1:33:07.420]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:08.460 --> 1:33:12.620]  what i hate is looking up and seeing
[1:33:12.620 --> 1:33:20.300]  chemtrails in a clear blue sky today
[1:33:20.540 --> 1:33:27.820]  what i hate is hitting roadblocks on a highway
[1:33:27.820 --> 1:33:33.820]  in my way
[1:33:34.300 --> 1:33:40.380]  what i live for is a chance to change and be
[1:33:40.380 --> 1:33:43.900]  everything i can be
[1:33:43.900 --> 1:33:46.780]  merrill haggard put this out a few years before he died
[1:33:46.780 --> 1:33:50.940]  he was a listener what i love never got a chance to
[1:33:50.940 --> 1:33:56.860]  meet him though someone brought enough to see
[1:33:56.860 --> 1:34:01.180]  yeah that element of oxide is key to get into your cells
[1:34:01.180 --> 1:34:05.820]  so they can program you and it's all in the studies they're just doing it to us
[1:34:05.820 --> 1:34:14.060]  again equations in 1898 by max plank uh were then used
[1:34:14.060 --> 1:34:16.460]  and credit was given to albert einstein for whatever reason but that's in the
[1:34:16.460 --> 1:34:22.700]  history books for the atomic bomb and the manhattan project
[1:34:23.820 --> 1:34:32.700]  that's 1898 equations for atomic bombs what do you think's going on in 2020
[1:34:32.700 --> 1:34:41.420]  designer geoengineered climates designer viruses
[1:34:44.220 --> 1:34:47.260]  i don't get up here and say all this horrible stuff to demoralize people i
[1:34:47.260 --> 1:34:50.380]  say it believing you're going to want to stand up to it and say no and
[1:34:50.380 --> 1:34:55.340]  we're seeing a huge awakening i'm not just being positive here
[1:34:55.340 --> 1:34:59.660]  everyone i know says everyone they know is talking about 5g and saying it is
[1:34:59.660 --> 1:35:05.340]  making the virus worse and then you look at the studies it does
[1:35:05.340 --> 1:35:09.900]  and everyone is looking up how all over the place they put them on schools
[1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:13.980]  and how during this rollout they're secretly putting them in schools and
[1:35:13.980 --> 1:35:17.580]  not even telling people and so folks are going out and showing these hospitals
[1:35:17.580 --> 1:35:22.140]  on the news that they say are full they show up
[1:35:23.020 --> 1:35:25.740]  they show up
[1:35:25.740 --> 1:35:32.060]  at the hospital minutes after sometimes and there's no one there
[1:35:32.060 --> 1:35:35.980]  it's all fake that's why you'll say the hospital's full everyone's dying and
[1:35:35.980 --> 1:35:39.180]  they'll show like two people in masks and protective gear at a door
[1:35:39.180 --> 1:35:42.700]  never a wide shot of the line
[1:35:43.580 --> 1:35:46.860]  and they're doing it over and over again but they announce that there's record
[1:35:46.860 --> 1:35:50.540]  deaths and it's the worst ever and it's an absolute height of 100,000 die that's
[1:35:50.540 --> 1:35:54.700]  terrible but the flu kills 80,000 sometimes
[1:35:55.660 --> 1:35:58.540]  if you run down a mid-nerve gas in world war one and they're starving to death
[1:35:58.540 --> 1:36:03.660]  and zinc deficient yeah almost all people that die were troops
[1:36:03.660 --> 1:36:09.500]  those food rationing here as well but but i'm digressing
[1:36:11.820 --> 1:36:16.860]  what i'm getting at here is ladies and gentlemen is that
[1:36:16.860 --> 1:36:23.980]  they know 5g and 4g and 3g gives you cancer and the evidence is all there
[1:36:23.980 --> 1:36:28.060]  and they know that it lowers your immune system and they tell you there's too
[1:36:28.060 --> 1:36:31.100]  many people we got to get rid of them that's the main measures of Bill Gates
[1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:36.380]  until he's oh i'll take your shot i don't want one old person to die
[1:36:36.380 --> 1:36:39.340]  and now the australian prime minister says you're not leaving your houses for
[1:36:39.340 --> 1:36:42.940]  six months or until a vaccine is available get used to it
[1:36:42.940 --> 1:36:48.220]  we'll play that clip in a moment he says i'm going to be honest with you
[1:36:50.780 --> 1:36:53.900]  but let's go ahead
[1:36:58.060 --> 1:37:03.660]  in this ai war because they've totally turned the ai on through all the devices
[1:37:03.660 --> 1:37:06.940]  just try sending text messages somebody about look at these articles about
[1:37:06.940 --> 1:37:10.780]  coronavirus and 5g and you will get text messages
[1:37:10.780 --> 1:37:14.620]  back from twitter or apple or google depending on what service you're using
[1:37:14.620 --> 1:37:17.500]  on your phone and we'll tell you that's not true it's now happening everybody's
[1:37:17.500 --> 1:37:22.060]  free everyone whoa they are yeah they told you they're listening
[1:37:22.060 --> 1:37:25.340]  you're not just watching what you type they're listening to you
[1:37:25.340 --> 1:37:29.020]  you go but that's criminal that's no you put up with it so now they're going to
[1:37:29.020 --> 1:37:31.660]  tell you stay in your house and now they're going to take your job and now
[1:37:31.660 --> 1:37:35.580]  they're going to force me inoculate you and they're going to kill you
[1:37:35.580 --> 1:37:40.700]  it'll take five ten years to do it until you admit i'm right and that
[1:37:40.700 --> 1:37:46.060]  all these other experts are right and that this is real if there's no hope
[1:37:47.340 --> 1:37:50.460]  you know at the end of world war two you can debate how many people hitler
[1:37:50.460 --> 1:37:52.860]  killed but he did start world war two he did invade
[1:37:52.860 --> 1:37:56.380]  russia he did attack england he did do all that stuff
[1:37:56.380 --> 1:38:00.540]  and he did round up and kill a bunch of people and i had family that was in
[1:38:00.540 --> 1:38:03.500]  world war two in italy head in germany
[1:38:03.500 --> 1:38:07.340]  grandfathers and others that saw it and piles of dead bodies a lot of them died
[1:38:07.340 --> 1:38:10.540]  from disease black birds everywhere eating people's eyeballs
[1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:15.100]  horrible stuff but we heard on the news at world war two
[1:38:15.100 --> 1:38:19.340]  that well the germans didn't know that hitler was doing all this
[1:38:19.340 --> 1:38:22.540]  and people saw that there's no way they didn't know that there was a death
[1:38:22.540 --> 1:38:26.300]  camp right next door but no they actually didn't they've interviewed them
[1:38:26.300 --> 1:38:30.380]  because it was compartmentalized and people were delusional about their
[1:38:30.380 --> 1:38:33.580]  government and you can have stuff going on right next to somebody
[1:38:33.580 --> 1:38:37.180]  and they don't know it because you're not going to say oh they're not killing
[1:38:37.180 --> 1:38:41.820]  little kids at that military base over there no way
[1:38:41.820 --> 1:38:44.860]  why my father was in the german army in world war one
[1:38:44.860 --> 1:38:48.700]  and there's no way us germans would do something like that
[1:38:48.700 --> 1:38:53.180]  but it turns out all these governments and groups do it
[1:38:53.180 --> 1:38:57.660]  and gg ping admires hitler sullen and mal on record and he's taught his people
[1:38:57.660 --> 1:39:00.540]  to hate us
[1:39:01.260 --> 1:39:04.540]  to try to unify them
[1:39:06.940 --> 1:39:10.460]  so i want to get into the news ahead of the gas popping on
[1:39:10.460 --> 1:39:13.980]  but i just want to tell you something right now
[1:39:17.820 --> 1:39:20.940]  the decision has been made to call the population and they're not going to
[1:39:20.940 --> 1:39:24.220]  send tanks to kill you because the military wouldn't do it
[1:39:24.220 --> 1:39:28.300]  they're going to send electromagnetic radiation and viruses
[1:39:28.300 --> 1:39:31.820]  they're going to pose as the saviors while they herd you into the cities
[1:39:31.820 --> 1:39:35.900]  shut down your real economy and enslave you
[1:39:35.900 --> 1:39:39.580]  because there's two different camps those that want a pro-human expansion
[1:39:39.580 --> 1:39:43.740]  and those that want to post human error and that's the reality
[1:39:43.740 --> 1:39:47.260]  and so when i get up here go look at the wall street journal admitting that
[1:39:47.260 --> 1:39:51.340]  jeffrey ebbstein billy malin the gates ted turner warren buffett
[1:39:51.340 --> 1:39:56.540]  george soros and all of them meet to to hatch a plan for depopulation 15 years
[1:39:56.540 --> 1:39:59.660]  ago and they call them heroes on abc news
[1:39:59.660 --> 1:40:03.580]  and the wall street journal and the london guardian
[1:40:05.420 --> 1:40:09.500]  you know in 12 monkeys it's a crazy guy at a bio weapons lab that gets it out
[1:40:09.500 --> 1:40:11.900]  to depopulate because he thinks he's part of an animal rights group
[1:40:11.900 --> 1:40:15.020]  thinks there's too many humans that's based on peter singer and peter it's
[1:40:15.020 --> 1:40:19.740]  really eugenics cult that's that's fiction though
[1:40:19.740 --> 1:40:24.460]  in the real world they're in the guardian saying we just met for a week
[1:40:24.460 --> 1:40:28.300]  at a secret location in new york to decide how how to have a world government
[1:40:28.300 --> 1:40:32.380]  to lower the population and save the planet and we think about 500 millions
[1:40:32.380 --> 1:40:35.500]  the number and people read that in newspapers and they
[1:40:35.500 --> 1:40:38.620]  feel like they're an elitist well obviously i won't be killed during this
[1:40:38.620 --> 1:40:44.540]  good yes there are too many poor people i you're reading your newspaper
[1:40:44.540 --> 1:40:49.100]  get what i'm saying folks you know let's say you're a writer at buzzfeed or the
[1:40:49.100 --> 1:40:51.980]  new york times you feel like you're part of the establishment you're a leftist
[1:40:51.980 --> 1:40:54.780]  and what matters is you know the class system and
[1:40:54.780 --> 1:40:57.980]  helping the poor and all that you know that's all control systems
[1:40:57.980 --> 1:41:00.940]  you know you don't care about the poor and you're an idiot you're all being
[1:41:00.940 --> 1:41:03.180]  laid off you're all going to have a guaranteed
[1:41:03.180 --> 1:41:06.380]  income but with that's going to come giving up your
[1:41:06.380 --> 1:41:09.660]  humanity and taking force inoculations and then not shooting your mouth off
[1:41:09.660 --> 1:41:13.740]  when oh gee you've got cancer
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:19.740]  and now you're going to die
[1:41:19.740 --> 1:41:25.900]  the honeymoon's over it's all over for the unknown soldier
[1:41:25.900 --> 1:41:29.100]  i've done an hour and 41 minutes and i'm not plugged once and if we don't we
[1:41:29.100 --> 1:41:31.980]  won't be here plus he's a product you need i keep telling you you want to get
[1:41:31.980 --> 1:41:35.500]  horrible food that the that they're running out of food that there is
[1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:39.020]  gonna be prices going up if there's price controls or just won't be food
[1:41:39.020 --> 1:41:42.220]  because folks won't be able to afford to get it to market food prices have gone
[1:41:42.220 --> 1:41:45.580]  up despite that our supplier now has more food and they're not
[1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:49.660]  raising prices even though their prices were up 10 for them six weeks ago
[1:41:49.660 --> 1:41:52.780]  up to 20 now they are not going up but they're
[1:41:52.780 --> 1:41:56.140]  going to have to halt food sales again you order now you'll get your food
[1:41:56.140 --> 1:41:59.900]  infowarstore.com but they're going to have to pause it again probably in a
[1:41:59.900 --> 1:42:03.340]  week or so because the sales are exploding and they can only they they
[1:42:03.340 --> 1:42:07.660]  open up two more factories but we had to stop sales for two weeks get your
[1:42:07.660 --> 1:42:11.340]  orders in now infowarstore.com and here's all the articles
[1:42:11.340 --> 1:42:15.020]  price controls mean shortages even during pandemics
[1:42:15.020 --> 1:42:18.860]  and it's a big article on that it's up on infowarstore.com i also suggest
[1:42:18.860 --> 1:42:22.300]  that you get vitamin mineral fusion for you and your children with all the
[1:42:22.300 --> 1:42:26.700]  vitamins the minerals the zinc all of it goes together uh and

[1:42:30.380 --> 1:42:33.180]  adults very powerful i would definitely get that
[1:42:33.180 --> 1:42:38.540]  for yourselves all of us 50 off and x3 x2 sold out x3 is going to sell out
[1:42:38.540 --> 1:42:42.700]  in about two weeks i said you know what let's go to 60 percent off to the 40
[1:42:42.700 --> 1:42:45.500]  and they're like we're gonna sell it even quicker that exactly i want to go
[1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:48.460]  down during this crisis even though i'm guaranteed to sell out of it and we
[1:42:48.460 --> 1:42:51.180]  won't have it for months you better get your x3
[1:42:51.180 --> 1:42:55.660]  right now while you still can x3 deep earth iodine and more
[1:42:55.660 --> 1:43:00.460]  bio pqq research that look into it for yourself
[1:43:00.460 --> 1:43:04.540]  big brother and the globalists don't want you to coq 10 oh you probably want
[1:43:04.540 --> 1:43:09.820]  to spend some time researching coq 10 and then research dna force plus and the
[1:43:09.820 --> 1:43:16.780]  types that we have in here the very best forms of pqq and coq 10
[1:43:16.780 --> 1:43:22.380]  and then a whole bunch of other natural ingredients for mother nature that are
[1:43:22.380 --> 1:43:28.540]  known to supercharge it all this is our best selling overall formula
[1:43:28.540 --> 1:43:32.300]  and i've told listeners at the end of last year that we can't sell products at
[1:43:32.300 --> 1:43:35.820]  50 off anymore because there's not enough markup
[1:43:35.820 --> 1:43:39.740]  in them to find our operations but because of what's happening and going
[1:43:39.740 --> 1:43:44.540]  on in the world right now i really want everybody who hasn't
[1:43:44.540 --> 1:43:48.140]  used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of dna force plus
[1:43:48.140 --> 1:43:52.780]  to have dna force plus for yourself and your family dna force plus
[1:43:52.780 --> 1:43:59.980]  now 50 off we knew early on the covet 19 was an engineered bio up but again
[1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:03.580]  people say oh that it must be the most deadly thing ever no
[1:44:03.580 --> 1:44:07.260]  it does clearly kill people but if you're going to release a bio weapon for
[1:44:07.260 --> 1:44:11.660]  fear in the bankrupting economy and cause panic and to run folks off the
[1:44:11.660 --> 1:44:15.260]  edge of a cliff and a giant artificial stampede you want to know the real
[1:44:15.260 --> 1:44:19.100]  trajectory kill a bunch of old people kill people that are deficient kill
[1:44:19.100 --> 1:44:22.300]  people that are already sick get rid of folks the globalists don't even want
[1:44:22.300 --> 1:44:25.980]  anyways but scare everybody else you want to control
[1:44:25.980 --> 1:44:30.860]  into submission and that's what's going on so people get confused by the paradox
[1:44:30.860 --> 1:44:34.220]  of you say it's a real virus you say it's serious but you say don't panic
[1:44:34.220 --> 1:44:37.820]  and don't shut the economy down exactly because if you do that they're
[1:44:37.820 --> 1:44:41.100]  going to keep releasing bio weapons over and over again because it works
[1:44:41.100 --> 1:44:45.260]  so well on the public most people are starting to wake up
[1:44:45.260 --> 1:44:49.020]  but we have to understand that pressures being put on trump to basically
[1:44:49.020 --> 1:44:51.820]  keep the economy shut for another six months to a year
[1:44:51.820 --> 1:44:56.460]  we'll be in a depression long before then we've got to go back to work
[1:44:56.460 --> 1:45:00.700]  i don't want to sit here and say see i told you so so people say oh
[1:45:00.700 --> 1:45:05.580]  alex jones is so smart oh he's so great i can hear less about that
[1:45:05.580 --> 1:45:11.180]  i want you to understand that back in mid january during a whole fake impeachment
[1:45:11.180 --> 1:45:15.420]  fiasco and the rest of it i was pointing out that the biggest
[1:45:15.420 --> 1:45:19.260]  issue would be the next move the next attack the globalists were going to
[1:45:19.260 --> 1:45:21.740]  launch they knew they didn't have the votes back then
[1:45:21.740 --> 1:45:26.220]  and i said we'd be an attack on the economy because criminals loved to brag
[1:45:26.220 --> 1:45:30.860]  and they were telegraphing the entire thing and now here we are ladies and
[1:45:30.860 --> 1:45:33.660]  gentlemen our economy shut down for over a month
[1:45:33.660 --> 1:45:36.780]  certain depression if it continues for more than a month
[1:45:36.780 --> 1:45:42.540]  and a half or so maybe even shorter and americans have failed the test they have
[1:45:42.540 --> 1:45:46.780]  gotten into the fear they've enjoyed not going into work it's been a new
[1:45:46.780 --> 1:45:50.620]  drama and the globalists are saying hell
[1:45:50.620 --> 1:45:53.740]  must destroy their way of life forever let's kill their confidence and give them
[1:45:53.740 --> 1:45:56.860]  a depression people better wake up now
[1:45:56.860 --> 1:46:02.940]  serving with info wars is a great honor but i still need my morning coffee

[1:47:15.660 --> 1:47:18.940]  i ain't trusting the globalists i ain't trusting their plan
[1:47:18.940 --> 1:47:27.500]  i don't plan for them i got a plan for them
[1:47:27.500 --> 1:47:32.460]  we're gonna cut their little cancer out with information warfare on the truth
[1:47:32.460 --> 1:47:37.180]  we've already planted the seeds that their program will never succeed
[1:47:37.180 --> 1:47:41.260]  because as they roll it out everyone sees it unfold exactly as we said
[1:47:41.260 --> 1:47:46.460]  everyone will have that moment of truth and Darth Vader throws Emperor Palpatine
[1:47:46.460 --> 1:47:50.220]  down the reactor shaft
[1:47:52.220 --> 1:47:55.420]  all right let's get into it right now
[1:47:56.540 --> 1:47:59.420]  i probably got 200 articles here in study so let's just
[1:47:59.420 --> 1:48:02.780]  let's just start at the beginning
[1:48:02.780 --> 1:48:13.180]  why the coronavirus pandemic may fast forward 5g adoption in the us c n b c
[1:48:13.180 --> 1:48:15.820]  because now you're not going to go to school and work pretty much ever again
[1:48:15.820 --> 1:48:21.420]  except for gatherings when it's authorized by the big tech giants
[1:48:21.420 --> 1:48:24.780]  that google now runs tracking you in real time that's and we told you that
[1:48:24.780 --> 1:48:28.940]  was happening now it's announced your location services
[1:48:28.940 --> 1:48:33.260]  so that's just one article and and they're now admit during this time they
[1:48:33.260 --> 1:48:36.060]  just so happened to have all of it ordered and ready
[1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:39.420]  and they are what people on the internet see and hear they're putting in 5g
[1:48:39.420 --> 1:48:42.860]  with cops acting all paranoid we have those videos coming up next hour
[1:48:42.860 --> 1:48:45.660]  well i actually went and looked it up and found out they are putting in 5g
[1:48:45.660 --> 1:48:48.060]  there but see that's how the public is they just go
[1:48:48.060 --> 1:48:50.300]  and say i heard this and the cops live to them and
[1:48:50.300 --> 1:48:54.060]  tenants were grabbing their guns like who are you here ask about that that
[1:48:54.060 --> 1:48:57.660]  that we keep that secret that's a little present for your children called
[1:48:57.660 --> 1:49:00.860]  death but see he's not even thinking that he's just
[1:49:00.860 --> 1:49:03.580]  doing his job
[1:49:04.380 --> 1:49:08.780]  during shutdown 5g being installed covertly in us schools
[1:49:08.780 --> 1:49:11.820]  department of education that was an op-ed news article
[1:49:11.820 --> 1:49:15.100]  and it links to the department of education admitting it it's a big length
[1:49:15.100 --> 1:49:19.180]  article so see it's not speculation there's viral videos of folks going on
[1:49:19.180 --> 1:49:22.780]  asking questions and that's good and they go i know
[1:49:22.780 --> 1:49:25.900]  you're putting in 5g in the cops all go how do you know that
[1:49:25.900 --> 1:49:29.180]  who are you you're not supposed to know that
[1:49:29.180 --> 1:49:33.100]  so it's just insane dps proposes putting
[1:49:33.100 --> 1:49:39.660]  5g cell towers on roughly 30 schools some parents aren't happy
[1:49:39.660 --> 1:49:43.500]  that's the denver channel and i showed you this article because they fought
[1:49:43.500 --> 1:49:47.660]  back and they said fine we'll put it out by the football field
[1:49:47.660 --> 1:49:53.020]  so it's not right over the little heads a mobile phone mass was relocated due to
[1:49:53.020 --> 1:49:57.340]  local concerns about school cancer cases that's right they had a whole bunch of
[1:49:57.340 --> 1:50:00.460]  cancers all of a sudden brain cancer skin cancers
[1:50:00.460 --> 1:50:04.860]  and you know and some death at the school there you can look that up
[1:50:04.860 --> 1:50:10.300]  glendale school parts could become non-preferred zones for 5g devices yeah
[1:50:10.300 --> 1:50:14.060]  folks aren't putting up with it oh but don't worry
[1:50:14.060 --> 1:50:17.660]  the houston chronicle has an article don't fall for the coronavirus 5g
[1:50:17.660 --> 1:50:21.100]  syndrome hoax on facebook that's right
[1:50:21.100 --> 1:50:25.420]  that it says microwaves and radiation and all of it doesn't hurt you
[1:50:25.420 --> 1:50:29.420]  and they say 5g doesn't create the virus well of course it doesn't create the
[1:50:29.420 --> 1:50:32.780]  virus it lowers your damn immunity but they always misrepresent
[1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:36.940]  so believe that houston chronicle hey how about you put all the 5g on top of
[1:50:36.940 --> 1:50:40.540]  the houston chronicle building see how that turns out for you
[1:50:40.540 --> 1:50:45.260]  just stay away from the damn kids okay houston chronicle defense convicted
[1:50:45.260 --> 1:50:48.140]  pedophiles having drag queen story time with her children remember that
[1:50:48.140 --> 1:50:51.020]  you talk about pure evil
[1:50:51.820 --> 1:50:54.460]  and of course parents are now hiring their own investigators and finding
[1:50:54.460 --> 1:50:57.660]  illegal levels oh yeah all this is illegal because it's about killing your
[1:50:57.660 --> 1:51:01.820]  ass unnamed 5g whistleblower claims that people
[1:51:01.820 --> 1:51:04.940]  are being infected why do you go to the unnamed
[1:51:04.940 --> 1:51:10.620]  you can show the articles and the admissions it lowers immunity i will
[1:51:10.620 --> 1:51:13.900]  but first let's go to this 5g tower last night
[1:51:13.900 --> 1:51:19.660]  set on fire in birmingham england and it's happening more and more let's roll
[1:51:19.660 --> 1:51:22.140]  that video
[1:51:23.420 --> 1:51:26.700]  they make them look like trees
[1:51:28.140 --> 1:51:32.380]  and they're in power poles or in light poles and all over the world people are
[1:51:32.380 --> 1:51:34.940]  showing them where trees are totally healthy and they put one in next to it
[1:51:34.940 --> 1:51:40.140]  the tree dies or just around the area close to it dies
[1:51:40.140 --> 1:51:43.980]  like let's show you more footage where they put 5g in all over england of the
[1:51:43.980 --> 1:51:47.980]  lamppost that is admittedly the 5g also has cameras and microphones hidden in it
[1:51:47.980 --> 1:51:51.580]  we've had the engineers that put them in on the show and uh notice the tree that
[1:51:51.580 --> 1:51:55.900]  was just alive a year before is now dead by the uh
[1:51:55.900 --> 1:51:59.740]  pole and then again for radio listeners you go to m4s.com
[1:51:59.740 --> 1:52:03.660]  for a live show to see the video posted here it is
[1:52:03.660 --> 1:52:09.580]  not a very good looking tree all the box falling off all on the left hand
[1:52:09.580 --> 1:52:12.220]  side looking the left hand side of that tree
[1:52:12.220 --> 1:52:15.180]  look at the right hand side
[1:52:15.660 --> 1:52:19.740]  that's alright yeah great well look at the right hand side of the tree look at
[1:52:19.740 --> 1:52:24.140]  the flower look at the bushes look at the green bushes yeah
[1:52:24.140 --> 1:52:29.500]  very nice look at the left hand side
[1:52:30.140 --> 1:52:36.460]  dead do you know why because that's right next to it
[1:52:36.460 --> 1:52:39.980]  look at this
[1:52:43.420 --> 1:52:48.380]  have you seen anything like that in your life it's got a light right there
[1:52:48.380 --> 1:52:54.780]  the transmitter on the top now how's that explain that the right hand side of
[1:52:54.780 --> 1:52:58.620]  the tree that's not next to the transmitter the grown away from it
[1:52:58.620 --> 1:53:01.420]  is okay i mean look at this look how shocking
[1:53:01.420 --> 1:53:07.660]  look at all the bark falling off all dead totally dead
[1:53:07.660 --> 1:53:12.460]  thought it was but you can say that's anecdotal until i show you the studies
[1:53:12.460 --> 1:53:16.620]  plants animals everything and let's explain something
[1:53:16.620 --> 1:53:20.620]  these are super high-powered up close and they're going to put up six million of
[1:53:20.620 --> 1:53:25.180]  them in phase one in the u.s. people go the chycons are using
[1:53:25.180 --> 1:53:28.620]  spy oh that too because it beams into everything
[1:53:28.620 --> 1:53:34.460]  the eye of soron sees all but it's medical doctors
[1:53:34.460 --> 1:53:37.340]  we played last hour breaking down how it's giving people cancer and what it's
[1:53:37.340 --> 1:53:40.060]  doing now let's start going through these
[1:53:40.060 --> 1:53:43.020]  wuhan was the province where 5g was rolled out
[1:53:43.020 --> 1:53:48.140]  now the center of the deadly virus major university studies
[1:53:48.140 --> 1:53:53.580]  wuhan city has about 10 000 5g base stations
[1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:57.500]  5g network coming to wuhan that's from three years ago
[1:53:57.500 --> 1:54:00.780]  china's first 5g campus network trial in wuhan
[1:54:00.780 --> 1:54:04.780]  two years ago 5g smartphones caused cancer big wireless doesn't want you to
[1:54:04.780 --> 1:54:08.620]  know wired magazine two years ago health experts question
[1:54:08.620 --> 1:54:11.020]  federal study linking cell phones to brain tumors
[1:54:11.020 --> 1:54:14.140]  oh yeah the experts from the phone companies you don't worry
[1:54:14.140 --> 1:54:19.260]  cancer risk from cell phone use is still a matter of study la times
[1:54:19.260 --> 1:54:22.940]  study of cell phone risk finds some evidence of linked to cancer
[1:54:22.940 --> 1:54:28.380]  at least in male rats the wall way installs 5g network in wuhan
[1:54:28.380 --> 1:54:34.460]  hospital and it goes on and on and on and on and on
[1:54:34.460 --> 1:54:39.980]  is 5g technology dangerous oh early studies show it does increase cancer la
[1:54:39.980 --> 1:54:43.340]  times but so what don't discriminate against cancer it
[1:54:43.340 --> 1:54:47.420]  deserves to grow in you and to be in you till you die
[1:54:47.420 --> 1:54:51.980]  why the coronavirus pandemic may fast forward 5g adoption oh yes
[1:54:51.980 --> 1:54:56.860]  china's ambitious 5g push china's launching its 5g network ahead of
[1:54:56.860 --> 1:55:00.300]  schedule and it goes on wall way and znet with
[1:55:00.300 --> 1:55:03.740]  contracts to build 200 000 5g base stations in u.s.
[1:55:03.740 --> 1:55:08.140]  emf and your immune system big studies just look it up yourself and when it
[1:55:08.140 --> 1:55:11.100]  does scientists and doctors warn of potential serious health
[1:55:11.100 --> 1:55:16.140]  effects of 5g other big study 5g the end of all things health impacts of
[1:55:16.140 --> 1:55:20.140]  electromagnetic radiation five terrifying realities of my
[1:55:20.140 --> 1:55:24.460]  job as a cell tower climber we have no research
[1:55:24.460 --> 1:55:28.380]  believe 5g is safe scientific america don't listen to them
[1:55:28.380 --> 1:55:32.140]  the flu and microwave sickness share some of them same symptoms
[1:55:32.140 --> 1:55:36.300]  by 5g cell towers are more dangerous get the facts
[1:55:36.300 --> 1:55:40.620]  5g wireless communications and health effects big studies
[1:55:40.620 --> 1:55:48.060]  and it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
[1:55:48.060 --> 1:55:51.180]  but don't worry they have smart city ecosystem frameworks
[1:55:51.180 --> 1:55:55.260]  and new bubble cities they're building for us
[1:55:55.260 --> 1:55:59.820]  fears 5g weapons systems in uk streets after conspiracy theorists takes a part
[1:55:59.820 --> 1:56:01.820]  light for the engineers that put them in they've
[1:56:01.820 --> 1:56:05.740]  actually got little weapon points on them that fire burst
[1:56:05.740 --> 1:56:11.180]  and he built systems for mi6 and he explains and i showed it to my dad who's
[1:56:11.180 --> 1:56:15.740]  an engineer and in one contest when he was like 15 and
[1:56:15.740 --> 1:56:18.860]  got a laser sent to him to see me construct it
[1:56:18.860 --> 1:56:22.300]  point is is that it's exactly what it is it's a
[1:56:22.300 --> 1:56:25.420]  particle beam but it's not like star wars we go
[1:56:25.420 --> 1:56:28.940]  the guy goes shoots through it just it just you know
[1:56:28.940 --> 1:56:32.060]  you just get hit with lots of little bursts as you drive you know you're the
[1:56:32.060 --> 1:56:34.860]  person they want to target they geolocate you're driving on a bike
[1:56:34.860 --> 1:56:39.420]  or you're in your car and it just hits you you hit me a couple hundred times
[1:56:39.420 --> 1:56:43.340]  a couple thousand times you then you get cancer and die so you just drive along
[1:56:43.340 --> 1:56:46.700]  and they've all got little little lasers but they're particle beams it's not
[1:56:46.700 --> 1:56:50.060]  visual water just love you love you die die die die die
[1:56:50.060 --> 1:56:53.820]  liberal liberal liberal and again i joke about this because i go crazy and
[1:56:53.820 --> 1:56:57.020]  start screaming and breaking things i'm so upset about this
[1:56:57.020 --> 1:57:00.300]  we have okay you understand particle beam weapons
[1:57:00.300 --> 1:57:04.380]  particle beam weapons particle beam weapons and they just shoot holes through
[1:57:04.380 --> 1:57:07.900]  your dna and your body just gets blasted and
[1:57:07.900 --> 1:57:11.020]  blasted and blasted they're like you do not need vitamin c
[1:57:11.020 --> 1:57:15.020]  you do not need zinc you do not need clean water fluoride is good
[1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:20.140]  fluoride is good your children need to die it's loving it's liberal
[1:57:20.140 --> 1:57:23.660]  let me get into more of the studies though with all the big 5g news breaking
[1:57:23.660 --> 1:57:26.140]  so let me tell everyone yes they're putting at the schools while they're
[1:57:26.140 --> 1:57:29.260]  closed yes it was already yes it's all confirmed
[1:57:29.260 --> 1:57:33.820]  department of energy giant rollout stealth attack rise of the machines
[1:57:33.820 --> 1:57:40.460]  it's here so speak out sue them remove them or slowly die soft kill
[1:57:40.460 --> 1:57:46.940]  weapons kill you slowly kill you quietly

[2:00:02.540 --> 2:00:06.540]  be on the old days the russians and then kgb
[2:00:06.540 --> 2:00:11.900]  or the fsb or the cia here prince intelligence did it too
[2:00:11.900 --> 2:00:15.820]  they'd steal them on history channel they would just have a little tablet of
[2:00:15.820 --> 2:00:21.980]  highly radioactive material and they'd put it under your car seat
[2:00:21.980 --> 2:00:24.860]  and then you drive your car around for about a month and then they go take a
[2:00:24.860 --> 2:00:28.540]  little cube out a little tablet out and then they'd be wearing lead gloves and
[2:00:28.540 --> 2:00:32.540]  stuff and uh you'd uh you'd get liver
[2:00:32.540 --> 2:00:37.020]  cancer and tessicular cancer and lung cancer and

[2:00:42.460 --> 2:00:46.620]  liberals loving just enjoy yourselves but now i forgot about that engineer we had
[2:00:46.620 --> 2:00:49.340]  on it's confirmed i showed to the engineers they said yeah that's what
[2:00:49.340 --> 2:00:53.020]  that is it shouldn't be on there little particle beams
[2:00:53.020 --> 2:00:57.180]  they got little accelerators in there so when they charge it up
[2:00:57.180 --> 2:01:00.780]  it's got a power supply twice what it should be of course
[2:01:00.780 --> 2:01:04.220]  uh and just remember everything you're given has really has another use it's
[2:01:04.220 --> 2:01:07.740]  like the doppler radar remember had an engineer i'm a good fellow i knew he
[2:01:07.740 --> 2:01:11.260]  freaked out and moved moved to montana and he was
[2:01:11.260 --> 2:01:15.020]  installing the doppler radar under that federal grant 20 years ago
[2:01:15.020 --> 2:01:18.300]  and he said alex they're running 10 times the power to it and he says they
[2:01:18.300 --> 2:01:22.140]  ionized the atmosphere with the chemtrails i thought he was
[2:01:22.140 --> 2:01:25.260]  i think it was crazy i just couldn't believe it later like five years later
[2:01:25.260 --> 2:01:29.420]  it was in the daily mail dubai makes the desert green
[2:01:29.420 --> 2:01:33.580]  by spring aluminum dioxide out of aircraft and then
[2:01:33.580 --> 2:01:38.700]  they have these antenna arrays that are radar doppler radar and they
[2:01:38.700 --> 2:01:42.860]  but they're more powerful and they fire up into the nuclei and form water
[2:01:42.860 --> 2:01:47.180]  droplets and and rain on the desert
[2:01:48.140 --> 2:01:52.140]  and i tried to get that guy's number i tried to find it try to get him on
[2:01:52.140 --> 2:01:58.380]  but but he quit as an engineer and just totally i mean
[2:01:58.380 --> 2:02:02.300]  because he's there mounting weapon systems
[2:02:02.300 --> 2:02:11.420]  i mean i remember in 1996 under federal law they put
[2:02:11.420 --> 2:02:16.060]  an updated eas system in all the radio stations and i worked in two stations
[2:02:16.060 --> 2:02:20.940]  and there was this old radio engineer who actually blew his head off
[2:02:20.940 --> 2:02:24.540]  a couple years later when they fired me it was because they fired me but he
[2:02:24.540 --> 2:02:27.820]  blew his head off right after that nice guy and kevin
[2:02:27.820 --> 2:02:33.180]  was a better and really smart guy and he brought me in there and showed me the
[2:02:33.180 --> 2:02:35.340]  manual and he said you're not even supposed to show
[2:02:35.340 --> 2:02:40.060]  other than the station owners managers and people the manual he showed it to me
[2:02:40.060 --> 2:02:43.260]  he said i don't care go ahead and copy the manual everything just don't tell
[2:02:43.260 --> 2:02:45.500]  him i didn't give it to you he goes and wait a few months he put it out
[2:02:45.500 --> 2:02:49.820]  because he was about to leave that job i didn't know he was suicidal
[2:02:49.820 --> 2:02:54.300]  and it was restricted and i put it on tv it's in it's in my police state 2000
[2:02:54.300 --> 2:02:58.460]  film and uh it was how now the radio
[2:02:58.460 --> 2:03:01.500]  stations were run by the satellites and by these radio
[2:03:01.500 --> 2:03:04.460]  transmitters that fema puts up that take control of your station
[2:03:04.460 --> 2:03:07.740]  when you're that rank rank rank that's the codes going into the machine
[2:03:07.740 --> 2:03:11.660]  i like the codes they send to submarines or you know to bombers you know to drop
[2:03:11.660 --> 2:03:14.540]  nukes they don't just send the crew up with the codes once they get over near
[2:03:14.540 --> 2:03:17.580]  target then they transmit codes if they want to attack
[2:03:17.580 --> 2:03:23.340]  um same system and i went on air and told people and the public didn't believe
[2:03:23.340 --> 2:03:25.660]  me now it's all out the open internet kills which
[2:03:25.660 --> 2:03:31.420]  obama put it all in and i didn't know if it was that or when i exposed the sign
[2:03:31.420 --> 2:03:34.300]  of the atlantic cable box the other engineer gave me i tore that open
[2:03:34.300 --> 2:03:36.860]  because engineers cared they were bringing me stuff not just the guy at the
[2:03:36.860 --> 2:03:41.420]  place other words and uh they literally sent
[2:03:41.420 --> 2:03:44.540]  it happened a couple times people to physically attack me to shut up about
[2:03:44.540 --> 2:03:47.580]  that it didn't go the way they thought it would
[2:03:47.580 --> 2:03:51.660]  uh but that's america folks okay so that was
[2:03:51.660 --> 2:03:59.100]  24 years ago 25 years ago 24 years ago and just think about everybody knows
[2:03:59.100 --> 2:04:02.220]  that's true now just like everything else and and now
[2:04:02.220 --> 2:04:07.420]  they're killing you and they think it's funny but there's
[2:04:07.420 --> 2:04:11.660]  towns everywhere that the elites are moving to that have regulations like in
[2:04:11.660 --> 2:04:17.260]  west virginia that no radiations allow
[2:04:17.260 --> 2:04:20.460]  and so we're going to be able to stop these people because they're going to
[2:04:20.460 --> 2:04:23.740]  kill so many folks that nobody's going to put up with it
[2:04:23.740 --> 2:04:28.140]  we have a special guest joining us but and i didn't get into all the studies
[2:04:28.140 --> 2:04:32.060]  and all all of it but we're going to get to it now and um
[2:04:32.060 --> 2:04:36.220]  just just the insanity of it all and i'm doing a special emergency broadcast
[2:04:36.220 --> 2:04:39.420]  um saturday and i've been doing these when i say i will now
[2:04:39.420 --> 2:04:42.140]  four to six p.m it may go longer we're trying to harm more people because i
[2:04:42.140 --> 2:04:45.100]  want to go seven days a week ten hours a day if i have to i mean this is the
[2:04:45.100 --> 2:04:48.620]  quickening this is everything you're living in a science fiction movie and
[2:04:48.620 --> 2:04:52.060]  it's all real info wars.com you might want to spread that link
[2:04:52.060 --> 2:04:54.860]  and save some people
[2:04:54.940 --> 2:04:58.940]  as bad as things are with now more than half the world population
[2:04:58.940 --> 2:05:01.980]  under martial law being directed by the un
[2:05:01.980 --> 2:05:06.940]  there is a massive awakening happening to the tyranny of big pharma and the
[2:05:06.940 --> 2:05:11.100]  medical mafia and the forced inoculations of the un
[2:05:11.100 --> 2:05:14.220]  admitting that vaccines are killing people and they've covered it up
[2:05:14.220 --> 2:05:18.220]  and everywhere i go i am just mobbed by folks on the street now

[2:07:24.620 --> 2:07:28.300]  gets there and no one's there and then he sits
[2:07:28.300 --> 2:07:31.580]  and they tell him we're not going to test you she goes and sits in his car
[2:07:31.580 --> 2:07:35.180]  and watches reads a book for hours and watches them

[2:08:52.540 --> 2:08:55.580]  satellites for folks that want it but i'm cutting the ads as much as i can
[2:08:55.580 --> 2:08:59.500]  do it weekdays that some of these stations are robot controlled literally
[2:08:59.500 --> 2:09:03.340]  so you can't skip breaks there's no person there at the thing to control them
[2:09:03.340 --> 2:09:06.780]  but thanks for joining us you didn't know what was going on as a guy that's

[2:09:17.020 --> 2:09:20.140]  but you didn't know what was going on three weeks ago i didn't either i wasn't
[2:09:20.140 --> 2:09:23.740]  sure then i'm starting to really think something stinks here now what do you
[2:09:23.740 --> 2:09:28.220]  think it is well i don't you know again alex i i i know
[2:09:28.220 --> 2:09:31.980]  something stinks and i've tried to wrap my mind around it
[2:09:31.980 --> 2:09:35.340]  and there's all this misinformation i'm glad that you've been talking about q
[2:09:35.340 --> 2:09:37.900]  which is is just confusing a lot of people
[2:09:37.900 --> 2:09:42.780]  but um and i also like how you brought up these people making these videos
[2:09:42.780 --> 2:09:47.180]  black dudes gay dudes all sorts of people but they're not willing to be slaves
[2:09:47.180 --> 2:09:51.900]  they do did not willing to be lied to and after i was on your show in my video
[2:09:51.900 --> 2:09:55.420]  in viral i received videos from all and
[2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:58.860]  photographs from all types of people not all christian conservative
[2:09:58.860 --> 2:10:03.900]  republicans all nurses doctors people in the medical industry
[2:10:03.900 --> 2:10:08.540]  people who just are concerned citizens my favorite podcaster
[2:10:08.540 --> 2:10:12.700]  went to the hospitals around new york city and um
[2:10:12.700 --> 2:10:16.380]  filmed and interviewed folk all different types of people
[2:10:16.380 --> 2:10:19.820]  all over the world not just in the united states
[2:10:19.820 --> 2:10:22.700]  and they're discovering the same thing by the way that's why i love having you
[2:10:22.700 --> 2:10:25.260]  on as a guest i want you to guesthouse anytime you want
[2:10:25.260 --> 2:10:29.180]  is that i meant to say up front the activism of people getting engaged
[2:10:29.180 --> 2:10:32.860]  is what will bring down tyranny and bring real clarity real journalism
[2:10:32.860 --> 2:10:36.780]  and and and the fact that that's exploding is really the positive news
[2:10:36.780 --> 2:10:40.140]  no i mean this is a you know an opera my hobby is mixed martial arts you know
[2:10:40.140 --> 2:10:42.860]  when you're in someone has you mounted when they try to
[2:10:42.860 --> 2:10:46.860]  do a submission or strike you that's when you do that's your great
[2:10:46.860 --> 2:10:51.420]  opportunity to switch the position and to and to get out of that
[2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:55.020]  exactly when the enemy attacks with something this big and this shaky
[2:10:55.020 --> 2:10:57.900]  they're either going to totally dominate us or we're going to defeat them i mean
[2:10:57.900 --> 2:11:01.500]  this is a real moment uh that that we can shine
[2:11:01.500 --> 2:11:05.340]  and they're going after the bill of rights one after another you just look
[2:11:05.340 --> 2:11:08.860]  at new york city first the blouse says he's going to
[2:11:08.860 --> 2:11:13.420]  shut down churches synagogues and mosques forever that dare open
[2:11:13.420 --> 2:11:17.340]  okay so probably a lot of people agreed with that now
[2:11:17.340 --> 2:11:22.300]  mayor governor qualmo comes out and says hospitals in red counties that's
[2:11:22.300 --> 2:11:26.860]  basically what he was saying hospitals in other parts of new york
[2:11:26.860 --> 2:11:30.860]  that have ventilators available to serve their community private hospitals
[2:11:30.860 --> 2:11:34.220]  he's just going to take them he's just going to take them
[2:11:34.220 --> 2:11:38.700]  he's going to comment near stuff to his his blue area and he knows it's illegal
[2:11:38.700 --> 2:11:41.660]  and he said sue me now what about alex you and i
[2:11:41.660 --> 2:11:45.660]  we're generous people i have a year supply of food and supplies for my family
[2:11:45.660 --> 2:11:49.020]  we're already tithing to our community we've just made a generous donation to
[2:11:49.020 --> 2:11:52.940]  a non-profit serving our our elderly we know one of my
[2:11:52.940 --> 2:11:56.140]  neighborhoods going to go hungry as long as the jones family and none of my
[2:11:56.140 --> 2:11:59.420]  friends or families going to go hungry as long as the jones family has food
[2:11:59.420 --> 2:12:04.620]  but i don't need the governor to say hey the hospitals we need these ventilators
[2:12:04.620 --> 2:12:08.380]  we're going to take them this is classic authoritarianism and it's to set the
[2:12:08.380 --> 2:12:12.860]  precedent that that they can comment here whatever they want
[2:12:12.860 --> 2:12:16.060]  and they will they went after the they're going after the churches now the
[2:12:16.060 --> 2:12:18.460]  hospitals next it's gonna they're gonna kick down your
[2:12:18.460 --> 2:12:22.540]  door to take your food supplies and i thought we loved our doctors and our
[2:12:22.540 --> 2:12:25.260]  nurses and our hospitalists and we respected them
[2:12:25.260 --> 2:12:30.060]  i respect i know that the the private hospital management
[2:12:30.060 --> 2:12:34.140]  in new york city i mean in new york state they communicate with their
[2:12:34.140 --> 2:12:37.420]  colleagues in new york city and i trust that they will do what's best for the
[2:12:37.420 --> 2:12:40.220]  community they would balance it out and if they
[2:12:40.220 --> 2:12:43.820]  didn't have as many cases they would drive it themselves they're exactly
[2:12:43.820 --> 2:12:47.500]  but by government just grabbing that's going to create a disaster and what
[2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:49.980]  about when the other town has cases it needs it
[2:12:49.980 --> 2:12:53.340]  now his commandeering will literally murder people
[2:12:53.340 --> 2:12:57.340]  literally murder people based on politics if you look at the private
[2:12:57.340 --> 2:12:59.580]  hospitals that Cuomo says he's going to
[2:12:59.580 --> 2:13:03.580]  commandeer those are going to be in red communities
[2:13:03.580 --> 2:13:06.620]  and this is what imagine president trump started taking
[2:13:06.620 --> 2:13:10.860]  ventilators from blue states and sending them to red state the blue states
[2:13:10.860 --> 2:13:15.020]  are are whining and bitching and saying everybody else is doing enough for them
[2:13:15.020 --> 2:13:19.180]  yeah that's Cuomo he's attacking the president and he's attacking hospitals
[2:13:19.180 --> 2:13:25.180]  he's attacking his own hospitals and you know our our founding fathers they
[2:13:25.180 --> 2:13:28.700]  knew they were ambitious men you know the left tells us they were they
[2:13:28.700 --> 2:13:32.460]  point out all of their flaws you know who knew this read the federal's papers
[2:13:32.460 --> 2:13:35.820]  the founding fathers knew they were ambitious they were prone to
[2:13:35.820 --> 2:13:39.180]  faction and that's why they tied themselves down with the constitution of
[2:13:39.180 --> 2:13:42.140]  all rights and that's why they tied themselves down and
[2:13:42.140 --> 2:13:46.860]  they tied us down and i guess you know it doesn't apply to Cuomo and
[2:13:46.860 --> 2:13:50.700]  de Blasio because they're such noble wonderful human beings that they know
[2:13:50.700 --> 2:13:54.940]  better than us and they're you know it's now they're calling an
[2:13:54.940 --> 2:13:58.140]  authoritarian stunt
[2:13:58.620 --> 2:14:02.380]  yeah no and alex you know when i first wrote my book thank you so much for
[2:14:02.380 --> 2:14:05.740]  holding it up you're the first guy i wanted to get it to because
[2:14:05.740 --> 2:14:09.820]  i wrote i saw this coming as a young undergraduate
[2:14:09.820 --> 2:14:13.420]  studying uh experiencing violence as a young man
[2:14:13.420 --> 2:14:17.180]  uh extreme violence and then studying genocide and
[2:14:17.180 --> 2:14:21.740]  genocide in total war the 20th century i had this fear
[2:14:21.740 --> 2:14:26.620]  to my core that my posterity would suffer the way my grandparents
[2:14:26.620 --> 2:14:30.460]  uh did and i thought i want to order my life
[2:14:30.460 --> 2:14:34.300]  to make sure that i can leave to my posterity this beautiful country that
[2:14:34.300 --> 2:14:38.060]  has been left to me freedom peace opportunity prosperity
[2:14:38.060 --> 2:14:41.980]  you know alex i was raised my mother had me at 16 i became a father at 18 dropped
[2:14:41.980 --> 2:14:45.660]  out of high school when i was last in my class at 17 and joined the army

[2:15:08.060 --> 2:15:11.580]  and when i'm in these places around the world doing my documentaries
[2:15:11.580 --> 2:15:14.620]  i i know the only difference between me and these folks is this
[2:15:14.620 --> 2:15:18.620]  this constitution our political traditions the bill of rights
[2:15:18.620 --> 2:15:22.060]  and now that's right they're road warrior hellholes because the people
[2:15:22.060 --> 2:15:26.220]  believe in conquest not in freedom that's right

[2:20:56.380 --> 2:21:00.700]  is his book i can't wait to read it but again i didn't even know who this guy
[2:21:00.700 --> 2:21:03.180]  was i was familiar with some of his films actually two of them i've actually
[2:21:03.180 --> 2:21:06.540]  seen two of them but i just said hey get this guy on
[2:21:06.540 --> 2:21:09.580]  that has his own little private youtube channel where he didn't mention all that
[2:21:09.580 --> 2:21:13.820]  showing the news saying that
[2:21:14.540 --> 2:21:17.180]  it's all packed at this treatment facility or at this testing facility but
[2:21:17.180 --> 2:21:20.220]  then nobody's there and they wouldn't do tests well that's a hoax well now
[2:21:20.220 --> 2:21:24.540]  it's all over the country our own crew tried to go get tested some of them and
[2:21:24.540 --> 2:21:29.180]  they wouldn't test them so something's going on here
[2:21:29.180 --> 2:21:32.780]  what do you think's going on a lot of folks just think it's it's it's
[2:21:32.780 --> 2:21:36.460]  absolute hype and that this is just truly a Psyop to lock everything down
[2:21:36.460 --> 2:21:39.500]  i mean we know government's using it for a power grab but
[2:21:39.500 --> 2:21:42.940]  are they absolutely behind the whole thing what do you think
[2:21:42.940 --> 2:21:47.260]  you know alex i i don't know but i think the important thing to know is
[2:21:47.260 --> 2:21:51.660]  they are using it for a power grab so whether this is a Psyop or whether
[2:21:51.660 --> 2:21:54.860]  this is they're really afraid of covid-19
[2:21:54.860 --> 2:21:58.380]  whether this was a biological weapon that was
[2:21:58.380 --> 2:22:02.780]  introduced intentionally or by accident by the communist party of china
[2:22:02.780 --> 2:22:06.460]  what we do know is the thing we know for sure
[2:22:06.460 --> 2:22:10.780]  is that this is a power grab it is our responsibility as citizens
[2:22:10.780 --> 2:22:14.060]  you you showed the picture from my twitter account that's the fall of troi
[2:22:14.060 --> 2:22:18.700]  it's my favorite painting in the world and neus has his father over his shoulders
[2:22:18.700 --> 2:22:21.740]  wife by his side and he's holding his little son's hand as their fleeing
[2:22:21.740 --> 2:22:25.820]  troi on their way to Rome the found Rome as we know
[2:22:25.820 --> 2:22:29.980]  and i love that painting because to me it sums up what it is my duty as a man
[2:22:29.980 --> 2:22:33.020]  we should be concerned about the elderly and immunocompromised
[2:22:33.020 --> 2:22:35.660]  there is an elderly woman who works for a pregnancy center that i'm on the
[2:22:35.660 --> 2:22:38.300]  board of in the hospital with pneumonia right now
[2:22:38.300 --> 2:22:41.820]  she has been told it's covid-19 and that's all i know
[2:22:41.820 --> 2:22:45.340]  but my sister during the break just texted me from a hospital that they
[2:22:45.340 --> 2:22:48.700]  were reporting in chicago is overwhelmed cook county hospital
[2:22:48.700 --> 2:22:51.820]  she goes brother i'm walking around this hospital and the staff says it's really
[2:22:51.820 --> 2:22:56.300]  slow but they're expecting this huge
[2:22:56.300 --> 2:23:00.380]  barra you know people they're digging mass graves they have a flash a red light
[2:23:00.380 --> 2:23:04.380]  a strobe light over new york city they are
[2:23:04.380 --> 2:23:09.980]  using this to take away our freedoms so we should care about the elderly of
[2:23:09.980 --> 2:23:14.140]  course we do we should care about the immunocompromised
[2:23:14.140 --> 2:23:16.940]  we do more than any country in the world we do we're the only country in the
[2:23:16.940 --> 2:23:19.420]  world where the department of justice
[2:23:19.420 --> 2:23:23.580]  roger severino said any discrimination any any favoring the young and the
[2:23:23.580 --> 2:23:26.700]  healthy over the elderly like an indian italy and china will be
[2:23:26.700 --> 2:23:30.380]  prosecuted we are that is who we are as americans
[2:23:30.380 --> 2:23:34.620]  but at the same time we must think of our posterity
[2:23:34.620 --> 2:23:38.540]  we're already in my neighborhood there's lines for food people are lining up
[2:23:38.540 --> 2:23:41.100]  outside the school two times a day for food
[2:23:41.100 --> 2:23:44.940]  they're already running out of food can you imagine a day in america where we
[2:23:44.940 --> 2:23:47.660]  have food lines we wait in lines for roller coasters
[2:23:47.660 --> 2:23:51.500]  and new iphone that's what we wait in line for now we're waiting in line for
[2:23:51.500 --> 2:23:57.180]  apple sauce and tater tots so our job right now is
[2:23:57.180 --> 2:24:01.100]  i think to to do what we know respond to what we know
[2:24:01.100 --> 2:24:05.740]  not given inch on our freedoms well being thoughtful to the vulnerable
[2:24:05.740 --> 2:24:09.260]  and we're told that we should love and respect our medical
[2:24:09.260 --> 2:24:13.020]  professionals which we do i was with the man who raised me
[2:24:13.020 --> 2:24:16.060]  as he died of the flu actually lung cancer but at the end it was the flu that
[2:24:16.060 --> 2:24:19.100]  took him we didn't tell people he died of the flu we said he died of lung
[2:24:19.100 --> 2:24:22.380]  cancer but it was at the end flu came in and took him
[2:24:22.380 --> 2:24:26.380]  and i was i fell in love with our medical community
[2:24:26.380 --> 2:24:29.580]  and which normally they want to socialize and tell us it's horrible
[2:24:29.580 --> 2:24:33.340]  it's always horrible our health care systems now now there's there
[2:24:33.340 --> 2:24:37.660]  we can't say anything but i you know watching how they cared for my father
[2:24:37.660 --> 2:24:40.780]  the discipline and the professionalism i have a new respect
[2:24:40.780 --> 2:24:44.540]  but now we have the governor of new york saying i have no respect for your
[2:24:44.540 --> 2:24:47.980]  property for your hospital we are going to come in and
[2:24:47.980 --> 2:24:51.020]  take what we want and send it where we want
[2:24:51.020 --> 2:24:57.740]  sue me and that we we must protect our churches we must protect our hospitals
[2:24:57.740 --> 2:25:01.260]  and what is next what is next is our homes
[2:25:01.260 --> 2:25:04.860]  what is next is you have food and they don't we're coming to get your food
[2:25:04.860 --> 2:25:07.900]  and not trusting that the american people are generous thoughtful and kind
[2:25:07.900 --> 2:25:11.660]  and know best how to distribute the food that they absolutely that's what
[2:25:11.660 --> 2:25:15.020]  qualmo's commandeering is all about and we told people nine weeks ago this was
[2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:18.140]  coming this is a psychological warfare test
[2:25:18.140 --> 2:25:21.740]  chason jones filmmaker and author and father is our
[2:25:21.740 --> 2:25:25.180]  guest here and you're absolutely right and this is
[2:25:25.180 --> 2:25:29.100]  teaching us to get rid of our values and our systems of checks and balances
[2:25:29.100 --> 2:25:33.580]  that that make us resilient and make us strong
[2:25:33.580 --> 2:25:37.100]  and then what do you make of 5g i can show you a bunch of studies even la
[2:25:37.100 --> 2:25:41.020]  times wired magazine with studies saying massive cancer increases major health
[2:25:41.020 --> 2:25:45.020]  problems he can surveil you worse than the other systems
[2:25:45.020 --> 2:25:49.020]  and now listeners are going out showing it being installed at schools everywhere
[2:25:49.020 --> 2:25:52.460]  just like you did showing nobody they're being tested
[2:25:52.460 --> 2:25:56.460]  and that that's a hoax and i went well let me actually check so i pulled up all
[2:25:56.460 --> 2:26:00.060]  these articles where there are installing 5g and had it ready before
[2:26:00.060 --> 2:26:03.980]  this i mean massive planning by bureaucracies
[2:26:03.980 --> 2:26:07.660]  and the left and the blue states and the blue cities and authoritarian regimes
[2:26:07.660 --> 2:26:11.180]  they set the precedent for the lockdowns and now the mayor of la says you got to
[2:26:11.180 --> 2:26:12.860]  wear a mask well now they're gonna try to push
[2:26:12.860 --> 2:26:16.860]  trump to say that so it's it's it's and now i've got articles in like the la
[2:26:16.860 --> 2:26:20.380]  times and reuters saying soon you'll all have to wear a mask year
[2:26:20.380 --> 2:26:23.500]  around forever and the australian prime minister says
[2:26:23.500 --> 2:26:27.340]  six months at least it's never going to end for synoculations i mean this is
[2:26:27.340 --> 2:26:30.460]  hellish and there's commercials now i've seen
[2:26:30.460 --> 2:26:34.540]  them running this is the new normal i've got news for them it is not the new
[2:26:34.540 --> 2:26:38.620]  normal we're americans this is not the new normal
[2:26:38.620 --> 2:26:43.580]  and they're turning us into and i'm not bad folks that want to wear a mask
[2:26:43.580 --> 2:26:47.500]  i'm saying them trying to make us do it is turning us into hypochondriac mental
[2:26:47.500 --> 2:26:51.260]  patients with neuroses when they're they're flipping the
[2:26:51.260 --> 2:26:54.300]  script constantly and that's where the distrust comes in
[2:26:54.300 --> 2:26:58.140]  one week it's don't wear masks it's irresponsible save the masks for those
[2:26:58.140 --> 2:27:00.620]  who need them the next week is everyone should be wearing masks
[2:27:00.620 --> 2:27:03.500]  when it comes to 5g they never allow clarity
[2:27:03.500 --> 2:27:08.380]  it's always confusion tyranny comes in with a confusing use of information as
[2:27:08.380 --> 2:27:11.260]  you've been saying for almost three decades the opaque
[2:27:11.260 --> 2:27:14.380]  use of language nosticism access to secret knowledge
[2:27:14.380 --> 2:27:17.820]  that's what makes q so dangerous people think they have access to secret
[2:27:17.820 --> 2:27:21.340]  knowledge but that comes from a place they tell you trust the plan
[2:27:21.340 --> 2:27:24.220]  when you're trusting trusting what plan from who
[2:27:24.220 --> 2:27:28.140]  who are you that i'm trusting what plan what's the plan you've told me you lie
[2:27:28.140 --> 2:27:31.420]  to me you say that you use lies for good we
[2:27:31.420 --> 2:27:34.140]  know that you cannot do evil the good will come of it
[2:27:34.140 --> 2:27:38.060]  speak honestly simply clearly say what you know
[2:27:38.060 --> 2:27:41.420]  speak it as simply and clearly as possible we're not getting that from our
[2:27:41.420 --> 2:27:44.380]  news media they're not they're not communicating to us
[2:27:44.380 --> 2:27:49.180]  clearly and simply the information no they're hyping up the fear as much as
[2:27:49.180 --> 2:27:52.620]  they can and you need to learn when something's coming from known liars you
[2:27:52.620 --> 2:27:56.540]  stop believing it now when we come back it's been a few minutes on
[2:27:56.540 --> 2:27:59.660]  the q movement now a lot of people identify with it they get into research
[2:27:59.660 --> 2:28:02.220]  when we attack you they go you have attacked me
[2:28:02.220 --> 2:28:06.780]  so you're based on something secret esoteric and you don't know who they
[2:28:06.780 --> 2:28:10.540]  are and it constantly lies to you but you keep investing because the feeling
[2:28:10.540 --> 2:28:13.740]  that you're in that you're part of something really special that's called
[2:28:13.740 --> 2:28:16.300]  the occult and it's how they get people into secret
[2:28:16.300 --> 2:28:19.260]  societies and beautiful women give themselves to these
[2:28:19.260 --> 2:28:22.940]  gross men who are conning them all it is is a scam
[2:28:22.940 --> 2:28:27.660]  everything powerful is virtuous and open and you know it's real and it
[2:28:27.660 --> 2:28:31.260]  regenerates and it's good and god gave it to us everything
[2:28:31.260 --> 2:28:36.060]  hidden and occult is because it's a fraud that people want to get that lottery
[2:28:36.060 --> 2:28:38.780]  ticket and that only have one chance out of 10 million to win
[2:28:38.780 --> 2:28:42.460]  because it's occult it's magic you're buying into a fraud
[2:28:42.460 --> 2:28:46.940]  and you know it's bad do you feel the satanic thrill of being conned

[2:30:55.260 --> 2:30:59.340]  my mind for more than eight weeks has been fixed
[2:30:59.340 --> 2:31:04.460]  constantly scanning constantly computing to understand the strategic attack
[2:31:04.460 --> 2:31:08.620]  we're witnessing we know by the scripting and the choreography
[2:31:08.620 --> 2:31:12.620]  and the fact that the virus has been scanned that it's man-made and attack on
[2:31:12.620 --> 2:31:16.060]  our economy the globalist media is firmly behind this
[2:31:16.060 --> 2:31:19.580]  devastating the united states and driving from from power
[2:31:19.580 --> 2:31:23.980]  but now we know from scores of studies from china the uk of the united
[2:31:23.980 --> 2:31:29.180]  states europe brazil japan that the virus
[2:31:29.180 --> 2:31:32.460]  reinfects and attacks different parts of the body
[2:31:32.460 --> 2:31:35.420]  that ladies and gentlemen is an engineered bio weapon just as the
[2:31:35.420 --> 2:31:39.180]  indian scientist eight weeks ago conclusively proved their major
[2:31:39.180 --> 2:31:41.820]  university they have a name for it at the
[2:31:41.820 --> 2:31:45.980]  pentagon it's called a soft to kill weapon
[2:31:45.980 --> 2:31:49.740]  it doesn't kill you usually the first time but the next time the third time
[2:31:49.740 --> 2:31:54.300]  of the fourth it does and it weighs down your economy in the process
[2:31:54.300 --> 2:32:00.620]  it's incontrovertible humanity is dying every metric every
[2:32:00.620 --> 2:32:05.740]  gauge we have shows that we're living shorter lives
[2:32:05.740 --> 2:32:11.580]  we are diseased our IQs are plunging and we're ugly
[2:32:11.580 --> 2:32:15.660]  we're falling apart big pharma and the entire
[2:32:15.660 --> 2:32:19.500]  globalist operation is a kill grid and the studies are clear the average
[2:32:19.500 --> 2:32:22.540]  person that is in a dreamlike state a near
[2:32:22.540 --> 2:32:27.260]  dreamlike daydream world program of the flicker rates of the
[2:32:27.260 --> 2:32:32.780]  televisions and all the screens we are in a trance
[2:32:32.780 --> 2:32:35.980]  and now they're turning up the power of the ambient
[2:32:35.980 --> 2:32:40.460]  electromagnetic radiation which again all the studies conclusively show
[2:32:40.460 --> 2:32:46.300]  cause massive cancer and destroy your immune system and push viruses across
[2:32:46.300 --> 2:32:50.540]  cell membrane we are being murdered and i've got to tell you
[2:32:50.540 --> 2:32:59.260]  it's very sophisticated and looks non-human you're listening to the alex
[2:32:59.260 --> 2:33:02.060]  jones show
[2:33:09.500 --> 2:33:13.340]  we are back under hostel shows and at manna video
[2:33:13.340 --> 2:33:17.180]  the average video now is getting like a hundred thousand views
[2:33:17.180 --> 2:33:20.540]  but we've hardly ever had a million views but we're putting out
[2:33:20.540 --> 2:33:24.620]  some exaggerate probably 50 60 videos a day
[2:33:24.620 --> 2:33:28.060]  so that's pretty amazing there's a video we put up yesterday hundred and
[2:33:28.060 --> 2:33:32.540]  fifty seven thousand views and we're not like facebook the counts just
[2:33:32.540 --> 2:33:35.100]  we go on the page and you know that counts as a view you click it that's
[2:33:35.100 --> 2:33:41.020]  another view that that's a view of it now what i wanted to hit here with
[2:33:41.020 --> 2:33:42.700]  savannah ananda's ride the shotgun with us
[2:33:42.700 --> 2:33:46.220]  a next time we'll look into her report when a doctor told her on camera
[2:33:46.220 --> 2:33:49.660]  and she's just gonna give her take right now here with jason jones filmmaker
[2:33:49.660 --> 2:33:52.620]  and author about citizen journalists going out and
[2:33:52.620 --> 2:33:55.980]  showing hospitals empty they claim her full testing centers they claim
[2:33:55.980 --> 2:33:58.540]  her full that are empty i mean same day stuff you've been
[2:33:58.540 --> 2:34:01.820]  showing but i wanted to say something about the q movement
[2:34:01.820 --> 2:34:05.900]  once somebody buys into the nigerian email scam
[2:34:05.900 --> 2:34:09.500]  i have known at least three people one of them was a talk show host on gcm
[2:34:09.500 --> 2:34:13.980]  like 17 18 years ago our network that syndicates us
[2:34:13.980 --> 2:34:17.180]  another was a distant family member and then another one was somebody else i
[2:34:17.180 --> 2:34:20.940]  knew in life just in business every time they ended up giving a couple thousand
[2:34:20.940 --> 2:34:25.020]  dollars to prince banga boogie i mean literally names like that
[2:34:25.020 --> 2:34:28.380]  once they conned them with the email you know they got this special business
[2:34:28.380 --> 2:34:31.020]  till you're gonna make a hundred thousand well now we'll need four or five
[2:34:31.020 --> 2:34:32.860]  thousand more now you're gonna get a half million
[2:34:32.860 --> 2:34:35.420]  and if you and if you give us ten thousand or whatever we're gonna let you
[2:34:35.420 --> 2:34:38.620]  talk to the prince on the phone this is a big honorable deal
[2:34:38.620 --> 2:34:41.580]  and then sometimes even have nigerians the area that show up at your house and
[2:34:41.580 --> 2:34:44.700]  guy gets out as the prince's representative wearing a little hat and
[2:34:44.700 --> 2:34:47.500]  all this i've seen this one time i was with
[2:34:47.500 --> 2:34:50.060]  mike judge at a bar back when i was still drinking
[2:34:50.060 --> 2:34:53.100]  under when i was getting divorced about six years ago we're at this dive bar in
[2:34:53.100 --> 2:34:57.420]  east austin and they're playing great jazz music and and and he was oh gosh
[2:34:57.420 --> 2:35:00.300]  look it's the nigerian scammers they come in here everyone's bowling down to
[2:35:00.300 --> 2:35:05.580]  them giving them free food or i mean wearing royal outfits just incredible
[2:35:05.580 --> 2:35:10.140]  but but here's how the scam works once you give them the thousand dollars
[2:35:10.140 --> 2:35:14.060]  now you don't want to admit you got conned so you keep giving them more
[2:35:14.060 --> 2:35:16.860]  until you give them everything you've got it and you never get anything
[2:35:16.860 --> 2:35:20.300]  and so that's like the main national product of nigeria scamming
[2:35:20.300 --> 2:35:24.300]  and that's what the q thing is is that you've got these proponents of q that
[2:35:24.300 --> 2:35:27.340]  have picked it up saying the lights go off in three days on saturday
[2:35:27.340 --> 2:35:31.180]  not gonna happen okay they'll use a few power outages that
[2:35:31.180 --> 2:35:34.940]  always happen to say it's true crazy people driving a train over because they
[2:35:34.940 --> 2:35:38.140]  think soros is on the ship in in in a new york
[2:35:38.140 --> 2:35:41.980]  this is mind control and i'm gonna tell you i know
[2:35:41.980 --> 2:35:44.860]  a guy on the trump campaign another person i'm gonna leave it at that
[2:35:44.860 --> 2:35:47.820]  it's not joe rogan i just mentioned joe the same talk people are saying i said
[2:35:47.820 --> 2:35:51.660]  joe rogan joe rogan says no do a cube he's the opposite of something like that
[2:35:51.660 --> 2:35:55.660]  and long story short i'm gonna get back to our guest here
[2:35:55.660 --> 2:36:00.700]  is that i just wanted to get you know tell people about this is so crazy
[2:36:00.700 --> 2:36:04.300]  is that i know the people that started it on four champ and they thought it was a
[2:36:04.300 --> 2:36:08.060]  way to get out dirt on hillary in the deep state and not get sued like i do
[2:36:08.060 --> 2:36:12.300]  okay and it instantly got hijacked and taken over by bad actors
[2:36:12.300 --> 2:36:16.460]  okay and so i know all the inside baseball and i've had all these big cube
[2:36:16.460 --> 2:36:20.620]  people calling don't you dare do this no no it's real we're real
[2:36:20.620 --> 2:36:24.060]  you research you're real great but all this breadcrumb crap
[2:36:24.060 --> 2:36:27.260]  none of the q people here's an example there's a video on youtube like a
[2:36:27.260 --> 2:36:30.940]  million views that they showed me the other day that just came out and it's
[2:36:30.940 --> 2:36:34.860]  q is telling you that it's a wuhan bio weapon and and that q has been given
[2:36:34.860 --> 2:36:38.220]  as intel when we broke it eight nine weeks ago and it's not about who broke it
[2:36:38.220 --> 2:36:42.300]  it's that they're full of crap so so i'm gonna stop ranting
[2:36:42.300 --> 2:36:46.460]  jason jones you got into this yourself and then we'll ask
[2:36:46.460 --> 2:36:50.460]  samar nandes why do you think people love it when
[2:36:50.460 --> 2:36:54.540]  oh 5g executive says it lowers your immune system
[2:36:54.540 --> 2:36:58.540]  uh that's in mainstream news but since it's a guy that's a whistleblower
[2:36:58.540 --> 2:37:02.300]  but we don't see his face everybody likes the thing that's speculative
[2:37:02.300 --> 2:37:05.020]  instead of the thing that's admitted so so there's something
[2:37:05.020 --> 2:37:08.780]  something to do with this yeah well the reason why q
[2:37:08.780 --> 2:37:13.020]  i ignored it you know when you're not in a crisis q is like dungeons and dragons
[2:37:13.020 --> 2:37:16.380]  and i have a lot of friends or anything whatever let them do their thing
[2:37:16.380 --> 2:37:20.700]  but now that we've hit this crisis it struck me how similar it is
[2:37:20.700 --> 2:37:25.180]  to these gnostic movements that were erupting in germany following world war
[2:37:25.180 --> 2:37:28.700]  two i'm following i'm sorry following world war one and you wonder how did the
[2:37:28.700 --> 2:37:35.180]  wymer republic the fool society yes how did the wymer republic collapse
[2:37:35.180 --> 2:37:40.460]  into totalitarian national socialism it was through these secret gnostic
[2:37:40.460 --> 2:37:44.700]  movements where people thought they had information you know that they originally
[2:37:44.700 --> 2:37:48.140]  would bother me the most about q was its constant calumny
[2:37:48.140 --> 2:37:53.260]  and anonymous you know posters saying the most awful things about real human
[2:37:53.260 --> 2:37:56.540]  beings and like you and i'm in the film industry there are
[2:37:56.540 --> 2:38:00.380]  celebrities who are my friends and then you hear people say the most
[2:38:00.380 --> 2:38:03.180]  awful things about them that you know aren't true
[2:38:03.180 --> 2:38:06.780]  and people in my family or my church will talk about these people like they
[2:38:06.780 --> 2:38:09.820]  know them and they this they have this and i have to remind them you know that's
[2:38:09.820 --> 2:38:13.580]  a sin of calumny that's a sin of detraction these are human beings that's
[2:38:13.580 --> 2:38:16.780]  right if you're gonna say something about somebody you better have the proof
[2:38:16.780 --> 2:38:21.420]  you better have the proof and it and it better um oh yeah oh the q tards say i'm
[2:38:21.420 --> 2:38:25.740]  in israeli operative and then they just say it oh we have it from the president
[2:38:25.740 --> 2:38:30.540]  we have it from trump through q that jones is a you just outrageous crap
[2:38:30.540 --> 2:38:34.780]  and by the way that's a good example alex you and i have friends
[2:38:34.780 --> 2:38:37.580]  i have friends in the intelligence community i have friends at the white
[2:38:37.580 --> 2:38:40.540]  house steve bannon is a friend of mine i've worked with them in the entertainment
[2:38:40.540 --> 2:38:44.540]  industry long before is andrew brybar was one of my best friends
[2:38:44.540 --> 2:38:50.140]  so um if if they want information they can give it to you alex
[2:38:50.140 --> 2:38:53.420]  jones if there are people in the white house or the you have and then people
[2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:56.220]  can trust you i understand that there are intelligence
[2:38:56.220 --> 2:38:59.580]  officers in a white house staff that can't come out and make statements
[2:38:59.580 --> 2:39:02.700]  but they have friends they can communicate to they don't have to go to
[2:39:02.700 --> 2:39:05.980]  some oh we had the secret service tell us that hillary was having convulsions
[2:39:05.980 --> 2:39:09.500]  and drove around a black man and and and they called him up later and they said
[2:39:09.500 --> 2:39:12.620]  get reporters following her she just fell down again
[2:39:12.620 --> 2:39:16.460]  and we didn't catch it but another guy caught it in new york so yeah
[2:39:16.460 --> 2:39:21.180]  exactly yeah no in fact i have friends that were in the secret service
[2:39:21.180 --> 2:39:24.460]  during the clinton administration in fact when bush was president i was the guy
[2:39:24.460 --> 2:39:26.460]  in the vanity fear article they said there was
[2:39:26.460 --> 2:39:30.060]  a guy wrestling secret service agents challenging the jujitsu matches that was
[2:39:30.060 --> 2:39:33.260]  me and um and they were telling me just the most
[2:39:33.260 --> 2:39:36.540]  off-the-wall stories about hillary clinton specifically not just bill
[2:39:36.540 --> 2:39:39.820]  clinton but hillary clinton and if i wanted to tell those stories
[2:39:39.820 --> 2:39:43.500]  you could say i don't trust jason jones or i trust jason jones but i know jason
[2:39:43.500 --> 2:39:49.340]  jones or i trust alex jones but when you have anonymous sources
[2:39:49.340 --> 2:39:53.580]  doing anonymous site speaking calamity detraction
[2:39:53.580 --> 2:39:56.700]  and telling you oh we lied to you for your own good
[2:39:56.700 --> 2:40:01.820]  look if you're a christian you cannot lie the good will come of it
[2:40:01.820 --> 2:40:06.860]  that's just very simple oh the creative satanism is do evil for good
[2:40:06.860 --> 2:40:09.740]  that's it that's any oh alex there's a principle i'd like to share with you it's
[2:40:09.740 --> 2:40:14.140]  called victimism feigning concern if the christian anthropologist
[2:40:14.140 --> 2:40:20.060]  from stanford lived through world war two uh his name is renais jarard any any
[2:40:20.060 --> 2:40:23.820]  any so there's this principle called victimism and the post christian
[2:40:23.820 --> 2:40:28.860]  society you can't openly war against the weak so you feign concern
[2:40:28.860 --> 2:40:33.980]  for the vulnerable to gain power to gain influence to gain well oh
[2:40:33.980 --> 2:40:36.780]  absolutely and then they put them into a cosmology a victimology
[2:40:36.780 --> 2:40:39.980]  where your only value is that you're a failure and that's what this is is
[2:40:39.980 --> 2:40:43.420]  turning us into wimps like like like chinese emperors that are in the
[2:40:43.420 --> 2:40:46.780]  forbidden city uh and then we're all walled off because we're a
[2:40:46.780 --> 2:40:50.140]  special interest group we have to be enslaved and controlled and coddled
[2:40:50.140 --> 2:40:55.340]  for our own good and those of us who refuse to be slaves
[2:40:55.340 --> 2:41:00.620]  then they can war against us on behalf of the people they've turned into victims
[2:41:00.620 --> 2:41:04.380]  that's the game and scapegoating becomes the key to that
[2:41:04.380 --> 2:41:08.460]  so now you pick a vulnerable minority group to blame for the
[2:41:08.460 --> 2:41:11.980]  disorder in society and you war against them so you
[2:41:11.980 --> 2:41:15.420]  it's the anti-vaxxers we don't vaccinate i wasn't vaccinated until i went in the
[2:41:15.420 --> 2:41:18.860]  army seven children they they're not vaccinated until they
[2:41:18.860 --> 2:41:22.620]  to join the military and um so you war against
[2:41:22.620 --> 2:41:25.980]  anti-vaxxers or people who believe in the bill of rights you know be all you
[2:41:25.980 --> 2:41:30.620]  you're selfish you know you're selfish and you think you have a right to your
[2:41:30.620 --> 2:41:33.340]  hospital you think you have a right to your home
[2:41:33.340 --> 2:41:37.820]  and you don't care about the common good so you're going to scapegoat people who
[2:41:37.820 --> 2:41:41.660]  believe in freedom people who loved god and want to worship
[2:41:41.660 --> 2:41:45.660]  oh yeah left us when they see conservatives christians and nationals
[2:41:45.660 --> 2:41:48.460]  they shake their heads and really believe we're the villains
[2:41:48.460 --> 2:41:51.580]  even though it's our system that builds all this wealth
[2:41:51.580 --> 2:41:55.660]  and then they don't even make that simple equation uh complete they just
[2:41:55.660 --> 2:41:59.180]  they're spiritually blind and it seems that delusion is getting stronger for
[2:41:59.180 --> 2:42:02.220]  some while the awakening is getting greater for others what
[2:42:02.220 --> 2:42:05.260]  would you call this time we're in right now
[2:42:05.260 --> 2:42:09.900]  you know i honestly think this is uh an actual a this is one of the most
[2:42:09.900 --> 2:42:14.220]  important moments alex jones and you and your audience were made for this time
[2:42:14.220 --> 2:42:18.460]  let's not be distracted with gnostic garbage let's

[2:46:50.140 --> 2:46:53.020]  and spread the word
[2:46:56.860 --> 2:47:01.500]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:01.500 --> 2:47:15.500]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones shows
[2:47:18.940 --> 2:47:23.980]  well everything we warned of is now launching exactly as a globalist
[2:47:23.980 --> 2:47:27.660]  would this is their prime attack it's what i always predicted
[2:47:27.660 --> 2:47:32.140]  they've got a 20 minute video on info wars called 15 times alex jones predicts
[2:47:32.140 --> 2:47:34.940]  the bio attack and i lay out exactly how they'll do it with
[2:47:34.940 --> 2:47:38.620]  drones the lockdowns training you by increment and then
[2:47:38.620 --> 2:47:41.500]  saying till you take inoculations you can't come out of your houses and now
[2:47:41.500 --> 2:47:44.380]  the australian prime minister has announced that
[2:47:44.380 --> 2:47:48.620]  i'll be back tomorrow at least two to four uh the crew is great
[2:47:48.620 --> 2:47:51.420]  and i'm really trying to you know get them to volunteer to come in and do
[2:47:51.420 --> 2:47:53.900]  these shows we're trying to hire more people right now as well
[2:47:53.900 --> 2:47:57.100]  because i quite frankly these are the times that try folks souls
[2:47:57.100 --> 2:47:59.500]  i'll do about 15 minutes the next hour savannah hernanda hasn't covered a
[2:47:59.500 --> 2:48:03.340]  bunch of breaking news and then a guy that predicted all of this and it's
[2:48:03.340 --> 2:48:06.540]  just a super brain when it comes to it dr nick baggage is going to do three
[2:48:06.540 --> 2:48:09.020]  segments and then the war room with old shroyer
[2:48:09.020 --> 2:48:13.260]  going back to our guest to conclude with him here in a moment
[2:48:13.260 --> 2:48:16.380]  i want to get more into this you know grand delusion how do we break through
[2:48:16.380 --> 2:48:21.100]  this quickening and how he sees people dividing into what
[2:48:21.100 --> 2:48:23.340]  camps but savannah hernandez before we get to your stories
[2:48:23.340 --> 2:48:27.020]  what do you think of just seeing all this unfold and
[2:48:27.020 --> 2:48:31.340]  uh the explosion of the q movement after it being discredited hundreds of times
[2:48:31.340 --> 2:48:34.620]  and telling people we lie to you for your own good and all this crap and then
[2:48:34.620 --> 2:48:38.380]  real people like this guy's in being i looked it up you know he's in big
[2:48:38.380 --> 2:48:41.260]  vanity fair articles at the white house hanging out with the president and
[2:48:41.260 --> 2:48:44.620]  secret service all these folks and he's a well-known award-winning filmmaker
[2:48:44.620 --> 2:48:48.140]  you know if he says hey secret service told me this nobody cares it's like
[2:48:48.140 --> 2:48:52.940]  secret service says he drives a black uh ambulance and that she's having
[2:48:52.940 --> 2:48:55.980]  convulsions every hour and falls down and that they've got to
[2:48:55.980 --> 2:49:01.020]  shoot her up with an epi pin we catch her falling down inside a tent
[2:49:01.020 --> 2:49:05.660]  two weeks later in ohio they cancel the speech
[2:49:05.660 --> 2:49:09.100]  you see them rushing him with stretchers and two weeks later
[2:49:09.100 --> 2:49:12.460]  it happens in new york i mean that's real intel that's
[2:49:12.460 --> 2:49:15.740]  real what we said but it was all secret we had a
[2:49:15.740 --> 2:49:19.740]  then it would be like golden power right alex and i think what you said
[2:49:19.740 --> 2:49:23.740]  earlier perfectly encapsulate this encapsulates this whole situation
[2:49:23.740 --> 2:49:26.620]  you talked about how people want to believe this speculation and if you
[2:49:26.620 --> 2:49:30.060]  look at what's happening around the world right now that's exactly it
[2:49:30.060 --> 2:49:33.820]  we are being fed all of these hypotheticals all of these projections
[2:49:33.820 --> 2:49:37.340]  and everyone is so easily being fooled by them and they're being scared they're
[2:49:37.340 --> 2:49:40.220]  being submissive so it's the same exact thing i mean all
[2:49:40.220 --> 2:49:43.420]  the people who follow the q movement they want to stay in your home it's all
[2:49:43.420 --> 2:49:47.340]  good when the power goes off it's good exactly rounding up the pedophiles
[2:49:47.340 --> 2:49:50.620]  so it's the exact same thing everyone in america everyone around the world
[2:49:50.620 --> 2:49:53.500]  has just shown their true colors they're submissive their sheep they want to be
[2:49:53.500 --> 2:49:57.820]  followers and the coronavirus and this movement as well has really exposed
[2:49:57.820 --> 2:50:00.700]  to that where do you think it's going because
[2:50:00.700 --> 2:50:04.540]  it's it's rolling out they're now announcing hey it's never really gonna
[2:50:04.540 --> 2:50:07.180]  end we told people that eight weeks ago this is not
[2:50:07.180 --> 2:50:10.380]  ever gonna end as long as we bend over and do this they're gonna give us the
[2:50:10.380 --> 2:50:13.500]  apps the drones the force inoculations it's never gonna
[2:50:13.500 --> 2:50:16.700]  end right we're seeing everything that was happening in china
[2:50:16.700 --> 2:50:20.540]  now moving to america it's now starting to happen here and the reason why i went
[2:50:20.540 --> 2:50:23.580]  yesterday too was because we're seeing so much reporting that hospitals are
[2:50:23.580 --> 2:50:26.540]  overrun so i wanted to go to one of these clinics where
[2:50:26.540 --> 2:50:29.900]  they're doing coronavirus testing and see if that was the case there too if
[2:50:29.900 --> 2:50:33.500]  people were getting tested if this clinic was going to be overrun
[2:50:33.500 --> 2:50:37.100]  and we drove past a couple of others as well we even went to st david's hospital
[2:50:37.100 --> 2:50:40.700]  and that is not the case here in texas this story came out today that says that
[2:50:40.700 --> 2:50:44.460]  uh some residents in laredo texas are going to face up to a thousand dollar
[2:50:44.460 --> 2:50:47.500]  fine if they don't wear face masks if they don't cover their mouth oh yeah they're
[2:50:47.500 --> 2:50:50.380]  gonna announce that within days exactly and then we saw that google is also
[2:50:50.380 --> 2:50:53.020]  going to be making an app that's going to be tracking people
[2:50:53.020 --> 2:50:56.860]  and see if they're properly socially distancing so everything that's happening
[2:50:56.860 --> 2:50:59.980]  that's the app you're gonna need to be able to travel and show you're good why
[2:50:59.980 --> 2:51:03.420]  and why are they doing this because it was always pre-plant
[2:51:03.420 --> 2:51:08.140]  and we're seeing that now and again the media has used this information that
[2:51:08.140 --> 2:51:10.940]  we're being fed now to scare people into submission
[2:51:10.940 --> 2:51:14.060]  and i think this has really been a big test to see how much
[2:51:14.060 --> 2:51:18.220]  americans would fight back against a socialist government against a government
[2:51:18.220 --> 2:51:21.420]  that was forcing them to stay in their homes forcing them to
[2:51:21.420 --> 2:51:24.860]  potentially get vaccines one day and people are sitting down people are
[2:51:24.860 --> 2:51:28.140]  being very submissive and that's what's being shown now
[2:51:28.140 --> 2:51:30.780]  well i was watching fox news during the break earlier we've got the clip coming
[2:51:30.780 --> 2:51:34.140]  up next hour and they're just like to as you're told stay inside everything
[2:51:34.140 --> 2:51:37.980]  we'll be fine it's like the running man or something but it's really
[2:51:37.980 --> 2:51:43.900]  happening and people submitting to it only encourages a further power grab
[2:51:43.900 --> 2:51:47.260]  and because the public's so into it trump tried to say seven weeks ago hey
[2:51:47.260 --> 2:51:50.380]  it's gonna be tough but we can handle this americans let's be strong
[2:51:50.380 --> 2:51:54.140]  and everybody got mad said no we want to be slaves so he's like okay
[2:51:54.140 --> 2:51:57.980]  and and so now we're going down this road jason jones
[2:51:57.980 --> 2:52:02.620]  looking at this what are the camps you see humanity dividing itself into
[2:52:02.620 --> 2:52:06.780]  well i like this report you know that's when you think of q or people who obey
[2:52:06.780 --> 2:52:10.780]  the big billboards do as you're told it's for the good or
[2:52:10.780 --> 2:52:13.820]  you know this is all for the good because q says so and we're running up
[2:52:13.820 --> 2:52:16.380]  pedophiles people are going to be passive
[2:52:16.380 --> 2:52:19.180]  i think the camps are being divided into the two camps that they're always
[2:52:19.180 --> 2:52:23.180]  been and denise prager had this new movies uh no safe spaces where he said
[2:52:23.180 --> 2:52:25.980]  the sad truth is maybe most people don't want to be free
[2:52:25.980 --> 2:52:30.380]  there are those of us who will only be free it's not we will but of course we
[2:52:30.380 --> 2:52:33.580]  know the places of the supposed safe spaces are the historically most
[2:52:33.580 --> 2:52:36.300]  dangerous places they're called jail cells
[2:52:36.300 --> 2:52:40.380]  yeah yes and the truth is this constitutional republic of ours
[2:52:40.380 --> 2:52:43.420]  for ethnic minorities religious minorities for women
[2:52:43.420 --> 2:52:46.860]  for the sick for the old is the safest place that has ever existed in the world
[2:52:46.860 --> 2:52:49.740]  so let's just preserve this constitutional republic
[2:52:49.740 --> 2:52:53.260]  and let's just resist this tyranny you know if your mother
[2:52:53.260 --> 2:52:58.860]  father brother sister child is dying my father died of the flu fighting cancer
[2:52:58.860 --> 2:53:02.700]  i was with him i prayed the rosary with him every night his last seven days
[2:53:02.700 --> 2:53:06.540]  we took different shifts and i took the nine p.m to six a.m shift
[2:53:06.540 --> 2:53:11.820]  and if he had COVID-19 i can promise you my father's last days i would be with him
[2:53:11.820 --> 2:53:17.820]  this letting our grandparents die alone for the good of this society oh yeah
[2:53:17.820 --> 2:53:21.820]  this thing of oh don't go see them lock up the lock up the nursing homes you
[2:53:21.820 --> 2:53:25.020]  can't see them that the nazi started in 33
[2:53:25.020 --> 2:53:29.980]  euthanizing old people and said oh they have viruses don't come see them
[2:53:29.980 --> 2:53:32.940]  yeah no they're telling us the loving thing to do
[2:53:32.940 --> 2:53:36.140]  is like i'm catholic the bishops aren't letting them get last rights or
[2:53:36.140 --> 2:53:40.380]  confession that's unbelievable so now my my grandfather my
[2:53:40.380 --> 2:53:44.060]  father is going to die alone without a recourse to the
[2:53:44.060 --> 2:53:46.540]  sacraments that we as catholic should all have a right to
[2:53:46.540 --> 2:53:51.020]  no the churches the synagogue how is it not essential to get last rights they
[2:53:51.020 --> 2:53:54.140]  banned jews last rights in israel three days ago
[2:53:54.140 --> 2:54:00.620]  they but oh the gay pride parades they can happen uh all this stuff
[2:54:00.620 --> 2:54:04.140]  abortions can happen abortions yeah abortion but you're not going to
[2:54:04.140 --> 2:54:10.540]  and our priests our pastors they should disobey this oh this was all preplanned
[2:54:10.540 --> 2:54:14.300]  this was all they're arresting pastors all over the u.s that defy this
[2:54:14.300 --> 2:54:18.060]  walmart is essential target is essential the liquor store is essential but you
[2:54:18.060 --> 2:54:21.260]  don't go to church and you don't go see your dying father or mother
[2:54:21.260 --> 2:54:28.060]  that's sick no in my casco they have hundreds of people
[2:54:28.060 --> 2:54:34.380]  we say you know nose to okole as we would say in hawaii uh every day all day
[2:54:34.380 --> 2:54:38.060]  but yet if we go to church um that's not essential
[2:54:38.060 --> 2:54:42.220]  well if you're godless that's not essential but it's not the government
[2:54:42.220 --> 2:54:46.700]  or yours job to tell me oh this is pure authoritarianism it's a 180 degrees
[2:54:46.700 --> 2:54:50.220]  opposite of what america is jason jones thank you so much for spending time

[2:55:01.500 --> 2:55:04.140]  there being tested they're on the news oh huge test everybody's sick
[2:55:04.140 --> 2:55:06.940]  wasn't real so now what are you things really going on here we know it's a
[2:55:06.940 --> 2:55:11.100]  bio web we know it does kill some people uh but and we know 5g does lower your
[2:55:11.100 --> 2:55:15.500]  immunity and it's just gotten rolled out and is is helping viruses and we know
[2:55:15.500 --> 2:55:18.940]  that that they're pushing notifications everybody's phone my wife and one of
[2:55:18.940 --> 2:55:23.900]  the crew members saying hey coronavirus is not connected to
[2:55:23.900 --> 2:55:27.260]  to 5g i mean that is like a science fiction nightmare
[2:55:27.260 --> 2:55:30.380]  i mean this they're listening to us they admit they are now and they're
[2:55:30.380 --> 2:55:34.700]  sending messages when they hear you saying it i'll say it again
[2:55:34.700 --> 2:55:38.700]  5g does lower your immune system and is connected to coronavirus go to hell
[2:55:38.700 --> 2:55:42.460]  robot you know alex like i was saying um
[2:55:42.460 --> 2:55:46.060]  previously i think this was a big test to see just how submissive
[2:55:46.060 --> 2:55:49.660]  americans would be when you got kicked off of social media when you first got
[2:55:49.660 --> 2:55:52.940]  kicked off of twitter you said i'm the first person they're going to do this
[2:55:52.940 --> 2:55:56.700]  to i'm the test case and even just going back to social
[2:55:56.700 --> 2:55:59.660]  media and seeing how much control you would have big
[2:55:59.660 --> 2:56:03.100]  tech take now it's transferred over into the real world
[2:56:03.100 --> 2:56:07.500]  and we're seeing how much um power and how much the government is taking away
[2:56:07.500 --> 2:56:10.460]  from us how much americans are going to be submissive
[2:56:10.460 --> 2:56:13.500]  and again there's so many conservatives and libertarians that i'm so
[2:56:13.500 --> 2:56:16.940]  disappointed in because as soon as this coronavirus came out they said
[2:56:16.940 --> 2:56:20.940]  you need to listen to the government take your $1,200 check don't go outside
[2:56:20.940 --> 2:56:24.460]  yeah they're all going with what's safe and then i got banned off the google
[2:56:24.460 --> 2:56:27.020]  app because i said the president's right hydroxy
[2:56:27.020 --> 2:56:30.300]  chloroquine and zinc are helping you and they said you're banned buddy there's
[2:56:30.300 --> 2:56:33.500]  no hope in america shut up bill gate says only the vaccine

[2:57:46.780 --> 2:57:50.780]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new
[2:57:50.780 --> 2:57:53.900]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[2:57:53.900 --> 2:57:57.580]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[2:57:57.580 --> 2:58:02.140]  eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[2:58:02.140 --> 2:58:05.980]  researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[2:58:05.980 --> 2:58:09.820]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[2:58:09.820 --> 2:58:13.740]  they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[2:58:13.740 --> 2:58:16.940]  we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting
[2:58:16.940 --> 2:58:20.860]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[2:58:20.860 --> 2:58:25.180]  pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine
[2:58:25.180 --> 2:58:28.940]  in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[2:58:28.940 --> 2:58:32.060]  activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies
[2:58:32.060 --> 2:58:35.180]  immune and inflammatory responses in the body

[3:00:01.180 --> 3:00:03.180]  here with us I want to play a few clips next
[3:00:03.180 --> 3:00:06.380]  second the short one you were pointing this out it's all over the news
[3:00:06.380 --> 3:00:10.380]  they are resting people that are out at parks that are swimming in the ocean
[3:00:10.380 --> 3:00:14.540]  that are surfing or paddleboarding in California now
[3:00:14.540 --> 3:00:18.460]  but oh well the virus might be in the ocean this is total
[3:00:18.460 --> 3:00:23.100]  hysteria psiop where you see the media now reporting from home and
[3:00:23.100 --> 3:00:26.460]  no one can leave but thank god the robots and drones can travel outside the
[3:00:26.460 --> 3:00:29.660]  bubble cities thank god because just like the movie the
[3:00:29.660 --> 3:00:32.060]  island you can't leave the fortress because
[3:00:32.060 --> 3:00:35.740]  there's a bio weapon out there the truth is you're just a prisoner
[3:00:35.740 --> 3:00:39.500]  this is like a bad science fiction movie it really is Alex and it's ridiculous I
[3:00:39.500 --> 3:00:42.300]  was just talking to you in the break about how Greg Abbott issued a new
[3:00:42.300 --> 3:00:45.660]  executive order requiring Texans to stay home unless
[3:00:45.660 --> 3:00:48.620]  they're part of an essential service or they're doing an essential thing such
[3:00:48.620 --> 3:00:51.260]  as grocery shopping but that's ridiculous I want to go
[3:00:51.260 --> 3:00:55.820]  paddleboarding when I'm paddleboarding I'm well over six feet apart from
[3:00:55.820 --> 3:00:58.940]  somebody why is the power ground exactly why is the
[3:00:58.940 --> 3:01:01.740]  government now telling me the power they want to tell you
[3:01:01.740 --> 3:01:05.900]  a prisoner sorry I'm ranting go ahead no it's okay it's it's very upsetting and
[3:01:05.900 --> 3:01:09.580]  this video that we're playing now is from la county there's a man that's out
[3:01:09.580 --> 3:01:12.540]  in the ocean paddleboarding and the police officers are on the
[3:01:12.540 --> 3:01:15.740]  shore they have a boat out there and they're basically having him come in
[3:01:15.740 --> 3:01:18.620]  and he's by himself in this video but they're having him come in because he's
[3:01:18.620 --> 3:01:22.780]  paddleboarding he's outside of his house he's not social
[3:01:22.780 --> 3:01:25.660]  distancing apparently well actually yeah this is social distancing there's no
[3:01:25.660 --> 3:01:29.100]  one around him but he's not self-quarantine well the argument is
[3:01:29.100 --> 3:01:31.900]  they dump some sewage out in the pacific ocean well why do you let him swim to
[3:01:31.900 --> 3:01:34.540]  begin with no the virus gets killed by anything
[3:01:34.540 --> 3:01:38.300]  electrochemical salt water it's well known it's dead in it's dead very
[3:01:38.300 --> 3:01:42.780]  quickly in in seconds probably maximum minute this is insane
[3:01:42.780 --> 3:01:48.300]  again what did Fauci say two days ago he said you
[3:01:48.300 --> 3:01:51.180]  will not be able to leave your house until no one is dying well that's
[3:01:51.180 --> 3:01:54.460]  impossible well and then Fauci came out yesterday
[3:01:54.460 --> 3:01:57.900]  and he said that we can't trust the models I've been looking at the models
[3:01:57.900 --> 3:02:00.860]  we can't trust models the models were originally saying that two million
[3:02:00.860 --> 3:02:04.460]  americans were going to die then they were saying 100,000 to 200,000 americans
[3:02:04.460 --> 3:02:07.420]  were going to die and now Fauci's saying well we can't even trust the models
[3:02:07.420 --> 3:02:10.940]  and then when it's 50,000 or something they'll go we saved you
[3:02:10.940 --> 3:02:15.020]  honestly Alex I think that the 100 to 200,000 death projection is too big
[3:02:15.020 --> 3:02:18.220]  even to begin there's not going to be that many deaths in America I'm going to
[3:02:18.220 --> 3:02:21.900]  say it except for 3,000 in New York but but anybody that has this common cold
[3:02:21.900 --> 3:02:26.060]  virus and out of a heart attack or cancer they're just saying it's COVID-19
[3:02:26.060 --> 3:02:29.020]  exactly so there's so much disinformation going around right now
[3:02:29.020 --> 3:02:32.140]  we're being told that there's a shortage of ventilators that's a lie
[3:02:32.140 --> 3:02:36.060]  we're being told that hospitals are overrun in specific areas like New York
[3:02:36.060 --> 3:02:39.660]  where the population is eight million and everyone stacked on top of each other
[3:02:39.660 --> 3:02:43.180]  maybe that's true but here in Texas that's not true we're seeing it in
[3:02:43.180 --> 3:02:47.260]  various other states as well what about the commandeering the ventilators now
[3:02:47.260 --> 3:02:50.540]  next is be our food and our guns well the New York Times put out a story that
[3:02:50.540 --> 3:02:54.380]  said that people are now having to share ventilators the other option is death
[3:02:54.380 --> 3:02:56.940]  but if you scroll 10 paragraphs into the story Alex
[3:02:56.940 --> 3:03:00.540]  you'll read that it says the hospital has not yet run out of ventilators
[3:03:00.540 --> 3:03:03.580]  so all they're doing with every single oh there's no doubt everyone's been ordered
[3:03:03.580 --> 3:03:08.300]  fear monger as much as possible exactly and it's it's just so ridiculous to see
[3:03:08.300 --> 3:03:11.900]  that everyone is now just being so submissive they're staying inside
[3:03:11.900 --> 3:03:15.660]  they're they're just so scared to even leave their house my mom was at HEB the
[3:03:15.660 --> 3:03:18.380]  other day and she was saying that she felt like she was living under a
[3:03:18.380 --> 3:03:21.820]  dictatorship because when she went to HEB with my little brother
[3:03:21.820 --> 3:03:26.300]  the employee screamed at her to get six feet apart from my little brother
[3:03:26.300 --> 3:03:29.180]  and they told them when they could walk up to the cash register there was a big
[3:03:29.180 --> 3:03:33.500]  plastic sheet all these people are loving the power of the police
[3:03:33.500 --> 3:03:36.380]  it's ridiculous and my mom was so upset she's like i'm never going back there
[3:03:36.380 --> 3:03:39.100]  again i've never been screamed at or treated that way here in america
[3:03:39.100 --> 3:03:41.820]  especially why can't my own son stand next to me
[3:03:41.820 --> 3:03:45.660]  it's ridiculous well this is let's talk about this when we come back
[3:03:45.660 --> 3:03:49.260]  there's the flip side people are now moving out the country people that
[3:03:49.260 --> 3:03:52.460]  didn't believe us are getting guns people are really waking up now
[3:03:52.460 --> 3:03:55.420]  i mean it's it's crazy you got a big portion that are getting into it you
[3:03:55.420 --> 3:03:58.940]  got other folks that know it's bull but like it's polite they get into the
[3:03:58.940 --> 3:04:01.340]  social distancing and next to me wearing the mask
[3:04:01.340 --> 3:04:05.500]  it's disgusting and i'm just gonna tell you people that i know that try to
[3:04:05.500 --> 3:04:08.460]  henpeck me or anything during this period it's one thing
[3:04:08.460 --> 3:04:10.620]  that people want to wear a mask and they want to get into the fear and then
[3:04:10.620 --> 3:04:13.260]  some people have autoimmune stuff and i'm and that's fine i'm not mad at folks
[3:04:13.260 --> 3:04:17.340]  that want to protect themselves but if you get into the police state angle of
[3:04:17.340 --> 3:04:20.380]  it i'm not associate with you anymore this is going to separate
[3:04:20.380 --> 3:04:23.020]  people that are under mind control from those that aren't savannah
[3:04:23.020 --> 3:04:26.060]  definitely honestly this whole entire experience has really separated the
[3:04:26.060 --> 3:04:28.780]  boys from the men and there's a lot of little scared
[3:04:28.780 --> 3:04:31.580]  boys out there there's a lot of people that are just allowing the government
[3:04:31.580 --> 3:04:34.300]  to do whatever they want and i'm really disappointed with them
[3:04:34.300 --> 3:04:37.420]  they do mystery they better be scared of the government power grab
[3:04:37.420 --> 3:04:39.980]  exactly exactly absolutely we're not saying you're
[3:04:39.980 --> 3:04:42.460]  bad if you wear a mask that's not what we're saying we're saying when they
[3:04:42.460 --> 3:04:45.900]  order everyone to wear them and then people call the police on you
[3:04:45.900 --> 3:04:51.020]  because you're not wearing one that's bs and it's already started
[3:04:52.300 --> 3:04:56.940]  we knew early on that covid-19 was an engineered bio weapon but again
[3:04:56.940 --> 3:05:00.540]  people say oh that it must be the most deadly thing ever no
[3:05:00.540 --> 3:05:03.980]  it does currently kill people but if you're going to release a bio weapon
[3:05:03.980 --> 3:05:07.260]  for fear and to bankrupt an economy and cause panic
[3:05:07.260 --> 3:05:11.180]  and to run folks off the edge of a cliff and a giant artificial stampede
[3:05:11.180 --> 3:05:14.620]  you want to know the real trajectory kill a bunch of old people kill people
[3:05:14.620 --> 3:05:17.500]  that are deficient kill people that are already sick
[3:05:17.500 --> 3:05:21.260]  get rid of folks the globalists don't even want anyways but scare everybody
[3:05:21.260 --> 3:05:26.380]  else you want to control into submission and that's what's going on so
[3:05:26.380 --> 3:05:29.580]  people get confused by the paradox of you say it's a real virus you say it's
[3:05:29.580 --> 3:05:33.420]  serious but you say don't panic and don't shut the economy down exactly
[3:05:33.420 --> 3:05:36.540]  because if you do that they're going to keep releasing bio weapons over and
[3:05:36.540 --> 3:05:40.460]  over again because it works so well on the public
[3:05:40.460 --> 3:05:44.620]  most people are starting to wake up but we have to understand that pressures
[3:05:44.620 --> 3:05:48.140]  being put on trump to basically keep the economy shut for other six months to
[3:05:48.140 --> 3:05:50.860]  a year will be a depression long before then we've
[3:05:50.860 --> 3:05:53.580]  got to go back to work
[3:05:59.420 --> 3:06:04.220]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[3:06:04.220 --> 3:06:09.580]  it's alex jones
[3:06:09.580 --> 3:06:14.860]  well i told you that they would first say two weeks like a holiday it's great
[3:06:14.860 --> 3:06:19.100]  do what you're told you're gonna get some free money so people said okay
[3:06:19.100 --> 3:06:22.780]  that's like buying the lottery ticket and when you don't win you want more
[3:06:22.780 --> 3:06:25.900]  or the nigerian email scam you invest money you don't want to admit you got
[3:06:25.900 --> 3:06:29.580]  ripped off you keep investing money once they got you with a tentacle
[3:06:29.580 --> 3:06:33.820]  once they got their hooks in you their pinchers on you then they go oh it'll
[3:06:33.820 --> 3:06:36.780]  be a month it'll be two months oh actually the plans a year and a half
[3:06:36.780 --> 3:06:39.820]  and i said folks it will never end it is the
[3:06:39.820 --> 3:06:43.180]  it is the world war three of psychological warfare
[3:06:43.180 --> 3:06:46.620]  now the story is up on info wars dot com coronavirus
[3:06:46.620 --> 3:06:49.980]  economic effects might last decades research suggests
[3:06:49.980 --> 3:06:53.820]  and i've got all these articles where they say that it's gonna last for years
[3:06:53.820 --> 3:06:57.580]  with new seasons where you can't go out and where
[3:06:57.580 --> 3:06:59.980]  you will not be able to leave your home until you've been forced to be
[3:06:59.980 --> 3:07:04.540]  inoculated here is the prime minister of australia prime minister
[3:07:04.540 --> 3:07:08.380]  scott morrison has
[3:07:08.380 --> 3:07:13.020]  said that life as we know it will not return for as much as six months
[3:07:13.020 --> 3:07:16.860]  and they're just being honest with everyone and until there is a vaccine
[3:07:16.860 --> 3:07:22.380]  only a vaccine will allow easing restrictions that's the headline
[3:07:22.380 --> 3:07:26.060]  if they're not in a position to be able to support themselves
[3:07:26.060 --> 3:07:29.900]  then there is the there is the alternative for them to return to their
[3:07:29.900 --> 3:07:32.700]  home countries we still have quite a number of people
[3:07:32.700 --> 3:07:37.260]  who are here on visitor visas my simple as much as it's lovely to have visitors
[3:07:37.260 --> 3:07:40.220]  to australia in in good times at times like this
[3:07:40.220 --> 3:07:44.380]  if you're a visitor in this country it is time as it has been now for
[3:07:44.380 --> 3:07:48.300]  some while and i know many visitors have to make your way home
[3:07:48.300 --> 3:07:51.900]  and to ensure that you can receive the supports that are available where they
[3:07:51.900 --> 3:07:55.980]  are in your home countries at this time australia must focus on its
[3:07:55.980 --> 3:07:59.900]  citizens and its residents to ensure that we can maximize
[3:07:59.900 --> 3:08:03.500]  this economic supports that we have
[3:08:03.500 --> 3:08:06.460]  but of course a lot of these countries are still importing foreigners and so is
[3:08:06.460 --> 3:08:10.300]  trump as fast as they can now let's play this clip with the corona police
[3:08:10.300 --> 3:08:13.580]  in the uk so it's gone from just take a two week holiday
[3:08:13.580 --> 3:08:17.980]  and i said folks it's the trap and now it's permanent
[3:08:17.980 --> 3:08:22.380]  and the drones are there to back the police up here it is
[3:08:22.380 --> 3:08:25.420]  and if you can't prove who you are you get arrested right the fine we're gonna
[3:08:25.420 --> 3:08:28.780]  drive but all right so simple fact is you can drive
[3:08:28.780 --> 3:08:32.620]  this car home because you're the driver the rest of the passengers have to walk
[3:08:32.620 --> 3:08:35.340]  to wherever they want to go to that's a dispersed and me and me and where your
[3:08:35.340 --> 3:08:38.380]  final destination is is down to you right you are allowed to be on the street
[3:08:38.380 --> 3:08:41.020]  together but we're in the car now together it doesn't matter
[3:08:41.020 --> 3:08:45.020]  so you're gonna separate more people into the streets separately away from
[3:08:45.020 --> 3:08:48.220]  each other why wearing the car together now it
[3:08:48.220 --> 3:08:51.180]  doesn't make a difference you're you're all rounders
[3:08:51.180 --> 3:08:55.900]  you've surrounded us with how many police are here i've seen police videos
[3:08:55.900 --> 3:08:59.740]  in europe and the u.s now in in leftist areas where they're telling families
[3:08:59.740 --> 3:09:02.380]  mothers fathers and kids oh you can't be together it's a family
[3:09:02.380 --> 3:09:06.220]  they live in a house this is all meant to see what the cops will do
[3:09:06.220 --> 3:09:09.900]  what we'll put up with and we're all in this giant experiment
[3:09:09.900 --> 3:09:13.740]  remember they had several university experiments that are very famous
[3:09:13.740 --> 3:09:17.740]  there's the milgram and the stanford ones where you could order
[3:09:17.740 --> 3:09:22.620]  these students through a glass wall to believe that they were administering
[3:09:22.620 --> 3:09:26.540]  deadly shocks or another case was a poison we got the real expert on this
[3:09:26.540 --> 3:09:28.940]  coming up perhaps we're back as you're talking about this next segment when we
[3:09:28.940 --> 3:09:33.980]  handed baton to him and most people around 90 percent of
[3:09:33.980 --> 3:09:37.980]  i remember correctly would administer death because an authority figure told
[3:09:37.980 --> 3:09:41.500]  him to do it so this is just incredible and in
[3:09:41.500 --> 3:09:45.500]  some cases they were in the room and they put actors in who were dying that
[3:09:45.500 --> 3:09:48.620]  people believed and they believe they would that they killed them
[3:09:48.620 --> 3:09:54.300]  because the professor ordered them to kill them kill them kill him now
[3:09:54.300 --> 3:09:58.300]  so then let's get to your report though it's up on infowars.com a band of
[3:09:58.300 --> 3:10:01.820]  video doctor says coronavirus tests only 60 percent accurate
[3:10:01.820 --> 3:10:05.340]  doesn't trust from china will forget trust from china we have the reports
[3:10:05.340 --> 3:10:08.780]  up where it's confirmed that they're sending contaminated kits and masks
[3:10:08.780 --> 3:10:12.140]  on purpose obviously they have chinese workers bragging about it
[3:10:12.140 --> 3:10:16.860]  here to hit us exactly elixin if though the biggest thing that we need to take
[3:10:16.860 --> 3:10:19.980]  away from this obviously is that we need to be making all of our essential
[3:10:19.980 --> 3:10:23.500]  goods here in the us we cannot be dependent on china anymore
[3:10:23.500 --> 3:10:26.540]  and um yeah it was very shocking to me to hear this doctor say that this
[3:10:26.540 --> 3:10:30.860]  coronavirus test was only 60 percent accurate i was talking to him about how
[3:10:30.860 --> 3:10:33.660]  you know i have had a little bit of a cough here and there for the past two
[3:10:33.660 --> 3:10:36.620]  weeks i do have seasonal allergies so i figured you
[3:10:36.620 --> 3:10:40.060]  know it's it's just for that but i was talking about it and i said okay well
[3:10:40.060 --> 3:10:43.500]  say for example my symptoms get worse i have a fever and chills should i come
[3:10:43.500 --> 3:10:46.620]  back here do i have to retake a flu and strep test which you had to take
[3:10:46.620 --> 3:10:49.740]  first before you could even try to get the coronavirus test
[3:10:49.740 --> 3:10:53.340]  and he said well the test is only 60 accurate anyway
[3:10:53.340 --> 3:10:57.100]  so basically stay home self quarantine and if you need to go to the hospital
[3:10:57.100 --> 3:10:59.500]  because you can't breathe go and then at that point
[3:10:59.500 --> 3:11:03.260]  you probably have coronavirus so the test isn't even accurate they don't
[3:11:03.260 --> 3:11:06.700]  trust any of the tests from china we know that this outbreak began in china
[3:11:06.700 --> 3:11:10.060]  as well and we have our whole entire media covering for them for some reason
[3:11:10.060 --> 3:11:13.180]  and we have the world's health organization covering for china as well
[3:11:13.180 --> 3:11:17.980]  so so much disinformation in our media so much chinese propaganda has been
[3:11:17.980 --> 3:11:21.980]  just parroted back over here in the u.s and i don't understand how we've gotten
[3:11:21.980 --> 3:11:25.900]  to a point where we have google making an app to
[3:11:25.900 --> 3:11:29.180]  track american citizens we have our own media
[3:11:29.180 --> 3:11:34.140]  parroting chinese propaganda and we have american submissive to our government
[3:11:34.140 --> 3:11:36.780]  it's basically china over here and it's so sad to see
[3:11:36.780 --> 3:11:40.220]  by the way nine weeks ago i said we're gonna have the same apps they're already
[3:11:40.220 --> 3:11:43.980]  made microsoft facebook they've already got them and google actually announced
[3:11:43.980 --> 3:11:46.700]  with facebook oh we're already tracking everyone we already give it to the
[3:11:46.700 --> 3:11:49.740]  police well alice when you reported on project dragonfly
[3:11:49.740 --> 3:11:53.420]  how many when i first started here you were talking about that
[3:11:53.420 --> 3:11:56.940]  and look at us i confronted some darpa chai a year and a half ago
[3:11:56.940 --> 3:12:00.380]  and he went into congress and said there is no dragonfly
[3:12:00.380 --> 3:12:04.220]  we don't track users exactly all the articles started coming out
[3:12:04.220 --> 3:12:07.340]  and they were doing it they were doing it 20 years ago folks they're lying
[3:12:07.340 --> 3:12:12.220]  criminals you heard of james bond villains google makes them look like
[3:12:12.220 --> 3:12:17.180]  nice people okay google and its motto don't be evil
[3:12:17.180 --> 3:12:20.220]  and that's the thing too alix you know uh there's so many times and i've said
[3:12:20.220 --> 3:12:23.500]  this before where i'm just like that can't be true alix are crazy and then
[3:12:23.500 --> 3:12:27.580]  look what happens jeffree ebstin magically commits suicide conveniently
[3:12:27.580 --> 3:12:31.100]  commits suicide project dragonfly turns out to be true
[3:12:31.100 --> 3:12:35.100]  china is developing an app to track people in the u.s the statesman reported
[3:12:35.100 --> 3:12:39.420]  five days ago jones has been sued for a report on jeffree ebstin
[3:12:39.420 --> 3:12:43.900]  uh and and they're so happy about it and and again they're just
[3:12:43.900 --> 3:12:47.660]  celebrating all this exactly and you know what alix i do want to
[3:12:47.660 --> 3:12:51.660]  say too while i am on your show that i am so grateful and i feel like our whole
[3:12:51.660 --> 3:12:55.180]  crew is because during this time where there is this pandemic going on people
[3:12:55.180 --> 3:12:58.220]  aren't allowed to go to work people aren't able to pay their bills you've been
[3:12:58.220 --> 3:13:02.300]  a great boss and i'm so grateful for that and you know our whole crew is
[3:13:02.300 --> 3:13:05.340]  and so honestly you know we see all these bad headlines about you
[3:13:05.340 --> 3:13:08.460]  but no one sees the good headlines about how you're taking care of not only
[3:13:08.460 --> 3:13:11.020]  your own family but all of our families here too
[3:13:11.020 --> 3:13:14.460]  well i appreciate you we need to stay on there and fight this
[3:13:14.460 --> 3:13:18.060]  and we're only essential for now and that notice now the companies decide
[3:13:18.060 --> 3:13:20.700]  what's essential but with the way it's really written they're laying all these
[3:13:20.700 --> 3:13:23.580]  leftist stuff saying they're not essential at these newspapers they're
[3:13:23.580 --> 3:13:27.500]  using it to deindustrialize and to move us into the
[3:13:27.500 --> 3:13:30.780]  post-human economy and all people that signed on to this who thought they'd be
[3:13:30.780 --> 3:13:34.620]  part of the upper class technology your fools
[3:13:34.620 --> 3:13:37.500]  so the listeners are like why are you always talking to the idiot left i'm
[3:13:37.500 --> 3:13:40.860]  trying to wake them up speaking of weighing people up here's part of your
[3:13:40.860 --> 3:13:44.780]  report when you're talking to the doctor and remember project veritas did this
[3:13:44.780 --> 3:13:48.940]  last week and cnn got it banned off youtube saying no one is allowed to
[3:13:48.940 --> 3:13:53.420]  question things even the president only the un world health organization and so
[3:13:53.420 --> 3:13:57.340]  he had doctors and military and nurses on video saying it's overblown it's
[3:13:57.340 --> 3:14:00.860]  overhyped it's a lie or hospital it doesn't even have anybody in it
[3:14:00.860 --> 3:14:04.220]  and that was banned because it didn't create fear just like they're banning
[3:14:04.220 --> 3:14:06.940]  people telling you zinc and vitamin c are being used to treat it by doctors
[3:14:06.940 --> 3:14:12.380]  that's a fact and they've gone to attorney generals and want me arrested
[3:14:12.380 --> 3:14:15.660]  for telling you about zinc folks these people are monsters
[3:14:15.660 --> 3:14:19.020]  and they're showing their colors now uh here's a clip of you talking to the
[3:14:19.020 --> 3:14:23.900]  doctors of the window so if i do end up getting
[3:14:23.900 --> 3:14:27.740]  she wasn't chilled again um or my cough comes back worse when i come back i
[3:14:27.740 --> 3:14:30.860]  still have to this is kind of a moving target okay
[3:14:30.860 --> 3:14:35.900]  like if you did that ideally i'm going to come back to get tested
[3:14:35.900 --> 3:14:39.580]  and at the same time you at that point even if it's a negative you need to stay
[3:14:39.580 --> 3:14:42.860]  away from people but you have to be able to kill the cops the test is only about
[3:14:42.860 --> 3:14:45.500]  60 percent accurate it's not that awesome okay
[3:14:45.500 --> 3:14:48.460]  if you get some negative it still happens
[3:14:48.460 --> 3:14:51.980]  so you said the test is only 60 percent accurate right now that's right
[3:14:51.980 --> 3:14:55.340]  okay all right you know we just think about a
[3:14:55.340 --> 3:14:58.860]  little bit too we gotta let people mass producing tests how quickly are they
[3:14:58.860 --> 3:15:01.740]  getting them to like FDA and approving them quickly how much are they really
[3:15:01.740 --> 3:15:04.540]  getting to check them yeah you know i wonder what we're
[3:15:04.540 --> 3:15:07.340]  going to find out later to be honest with you like whether how accurate they
[3:15:07.340 --> 3:15:10.780]  were at all yeah i saw it sorry that uh those tests that were produced out of
[3:15:10.780 --> 3:15:13.980]  china were not correct and that they were you know
[3:15:13.980 --> 3:15:17.180]  misdiagnosed so how did you get that story for years and years and years ago about
[3:15:17.180 --> 3:15:21.260]  lots of stuff we get from China good lord yeah these are the top reports 50

[3:22:19.900 --> 3:22:24.220]  you know during this particular time in our nation's history there's a lot
[3:22:24.220 --> 3:22:29.740]  um to be said you know and in info wars has always been like the
[3:22:29.740 --> 3:22:34.380]  early warning system you know for what's happening in the world it's one of
[3:22:34.380 --> 3:22:37.660]  the reasons that we've worked together now 25 years
[3:22:37.660 --> 3:22:41.580]  i remember when you were in public access tv just starting out
[3:22:41.580 --> 3:22:45.820]  i i always thought you were older you don't always blew me away uh
[3:22:45.820 --> 3:22:50.780]  when i finally met you in person you know and you know when i think about
[3:22:50.780 --> 3:22:54.060]  what's happened and being ahead of the curve
[3:22:54.060 --> 3:22:58.620]  which we've been uh what's the value of that if we don't do anything with that
[3:22:58.620 --> 3:23:01.660]  knowledge and and today i'm kind of splitting
[3:23:01.660 --> 3:23:05.420]  my uh show into two sort of segments and one i'm calling
[3:23:05.420 --> 3:23:10.860]  um the economic pandemic slash solutions because there's
[3:23:10.860 --> 3:23:15.660]  actually a few that are being fielded some that are being attempted but
[3:23:15.660 --> 3:23:20.300]  really i want to talk about um what isn't being
[3:23:20.300 --> 3:23:23.500]  said right now that that absolutely needs to be
[3:23:23.500 --> 3:23:27.660]  and and and and on the economic side there's a couple of things that are
[3:23:27.660 --> 3:23:31.260]  really important that the mainstream lamestream media
[3:23:31.260 --> 3:23:35.180]  is missing that small businesses hairdressers
[3:23:35.180 --> 3:23:40.060]  misophage therapists uh people that own small businesses that are now closed
[3:23:40.060 --> 3:23:44.300]  restaurant owners etc and gig workers a whole bunch of people
[3:23:44.300 --> 3:23:47.900]  that don't have unemployment coming that they kind of patched up
[3:23:47.900 --> 3:23:51.980]  but i want to mention what is out there and whether we agree or disagree with
[3:23:51.980 --> 3:23:56.620]  us two trillion dollar plus expenditure you need to know what's
[3:23:56.620 --> 3:24:00.140]  there an sba has two programs that are being
[3:24:00.140 --> 3:24:05.820]  pitched as loans but they're grants and they apply to companies with 500
[3:24:05.820 --> 3:24:11.180]  employees or less and not just companies proprietorship small businesses
[3:24:11.180 --> 3:24:14.780]  uh individual partnerships i mean all of those structures
[3:24:14.780 --> 3:24:18.540]  llc's fall under this umbrella and there's two programs i'm going to
[3:24:18.540 --> 3:24:22.380]  mention today that are extremely important one
[3:24:22.380 --> 3:24:26.060]  is one that you have to go through your bank and it's called the payroll
[3:24:26.060 --> 3:24:30.380]  protection plan and it affects you and your employee
[3:24:30.380 --> 3:24:34.780]  employees if you're a employee of a small business
[3:24:34.780 --> 3:24:37.260]  you need to call your small business employer
[3:24:37.260 --> 3:24:40.860]  and make sure they look this up on the on the sba
[3:24:40.860 --> 3:24:46.540]  ba's website okay and you have to file a thing on the sba's website if you
[3:24:46.540 --> 3:24:50.780]  want to qualify but what it is is a structure it as a loan and
[3:24:50.780 --> 3:24:55.020]  they tell you it's a loan it's a uh it's a loan at one percent
[3:24:55.020 --> 3:24:58.940]  interest for essentially two years what they don't
[3:24:58.940 --> 3:25:04.300]  clearly tell you in the media is this converts a big chunk of this converts
[3:25:04.300 --> 3:25:08.780]  potentially is as much as two and a half months
[3:25:08.780 --> 3:25:14.460]  of your businesses payroll benefits which include insurance and 401ks
[3:25:14.460 --> 3:25:18.540]  utilities and rents can be covered under this
[3:25:18.540 --> 3:25:22.620]  action and it's very easy the applications are really simple some of
[3:25:22.620 --> 3:25:26.220]  the banks are running a little bit uh slow on getting them
[3:25:26.220 --> 3:25:28.620]  acted and some are refusing you know the original
[3:25:28.620 --> 3:25:34.780]  ideal was two percent loans at a half a percent with a big chunk of it
[3:25:34.780 --> 3:25:38.140]  forgiven and how that works look at the sba's
[3:25:38.140 --> 3:25:42.780]  site extremely important small businesses it's a way to pay your people
[3:25:42.780 --> 3:25:46.700]  and not have a liability through a standard kind of loan
[3:25:46.700 --> 3:25:50.380]  a configuration instead of giving it directly to the banks
[3:25:50.380 --> 3:25:54.460]  this time as some free lunch they're actually passing it to small business
[3:25:54.460 --> 3:25:59.820]  centers payroll protection program talk to your bankers talk to your credit
[3:25:59.820 --> 3:26:03.820]  unions know what this is about it's very simple the other one
[3:26:03.820 --> 3:26:07.980]  is like an automatic pilot you do it online with the sba
[3:26:07.980 --> 3:26:12.460]  it takes 10 minutes and it's a ten thousand dollar grant for the same
[3:26:12.460 --> 3:26:16.540]  classes of people take a look at it extremely
[3:26:16.540 --> 3:26:20.700]  important you know i know people don't like this helicopter
[3:26:20.700 --> 3:26:25.020]  money thing going on we're in a long-term problem
[3:26:25.020 --> 3:26:29.100]  on the screen if you're looking right now as a small business guidance is being
[3:26:29.100 --> 3:26:35.420]  told and sold as a loan but look at it carefully the first ten thousands
[3:26:35.420 --> 3:26:39.340]  is an automatic grant a gift it's forgiven
[3:26:39.340 --> 3:26:42.780]  you can use it for keeping your businesses lights on
[3:26:42.780 --> 3:26:46.380]  keeping your payrolls paid if you're a small business
[3:26:46.380 --> 3:26:50.620]  take a look look at it right now it's important and it applies to every small
[3:26:50.620 --> 3:26:55.580]  business under 500 employees from the mom and pop
[3:26:55.580 --> 3:26:59.580]  to the gig worker take a look anyway i want to mention that because that's
[3:26:59.580 --> 3:27:04.780]  already in play available to americans today it opened up
[3:27:04.780 --> 3:27:09.820]  today april third officially at at the banks ppp
[3:27:09.820 --> 3:27:14.140]  the other one that's extremely important is of course that ten thousand
[3:27:14.140 --> 3:27:18.620]  dollar straight grant at sba's site that is open right now online
[3:27:18.620 --> 3:27:22.140]  ten minutes to apply go do it if you're a business
[3:27:22.140 --> 3:27:26.540]  go take care of these things because if they're not done between now and june
[3:27:26.540 --> 3:27:30.380]  30th the opportunity is gone if the eight weeks that you're
[3:27:30.380 --> 3:27:34.780]  counting for under these grants isn't expended during the same period
[3:27:34.780 --> 3:27:38.540]  from today till june 30th it won't count as a grant
[3:27:38.540 --> 3:27:43.100]  so look now look today pass it on spread the word
[3:27:43.100 --> 3:27:47.100]  because this is important the other one i want to mention and i hope i don't run
[3:27:47.100 --> 3:27:49.100]  out in this segment if we do we'll carry it
[3:27:49.100 --> 3:27:52.700]  carry it over and it's an idea of my son nicholas
[3:27:52.700 --> 3:27:56.620]  three my oldest son he's in his early 40s
[3:27:56.620 --> 3:27:59.580]  pretty close to alex was dangerous kind of bizarre
[3:27:59.580 --> 3:28:04.540]  but but in any case here's the deal and it was a great idea you know how
[3:28:04.540 --> 3:28:08.220]  all the banks now are getting the zero interest money through the federal
[3:28:08.220 --> 3:28:12.060]  reserve shenanigans you know essentially zero interest
[3:28:12.060 --> 3:28:15.740]  what about this and the mortgage industry we just heard 30 percent of
[3:28:15.740 --> 3:28:19.260]  mortgages might default this is horrible and we're hearing
[3:28:19.260 --> 3:28:22.860]  about a rent strike where renters won't pay their bills
[3:28:22.860 --> 3:28:27.820]  and landlords won't get paid this will compound the problem if we have these
[3:28:27.820 --> 3:28:30.460]  foreclosures after the break i'm going to talk
[3:28:30.460 --> 3:28:34.140]  about a solution one that we can do right now that will stimulate this
[3:28:34.140 --> 3:28:38.140]  economy for 30 years going forward it's a visionary
[3:28:38.140 --> 3:28:42.860]  approach to solving the problem at a time when helicopter market money is not
[3:28:42.860 --> 3:28:46.460]  the solution this is nick baggage you're at the tip of the spear this is

[3:30:09.100 --> 3:30:13.180]  that causes people to work hard and believe in the future and invest
[3:30:13.180 --> 3:30:16.780]  its spirit and the entire media and the entire culture
[3:30:16.780 --> 3:30:20.140]  all these multinational governments in the u.n the w.h.o and the
[3:30:20.140 --> 3:30:25.900]  chai comms in hollywood have been having orgasmic delight
[3:30:25.900 --> 3:30:31.020]  over how plightly everyone has gotten into a state of fear
[3:30:31.020 --> 3:30:35.100]  yes the virus is real it's going to be maybe double what the flu is normally
[3:30:35.100 --> 3:30:38.860]  and it's a bio weapon but a bio weapon the globalist do the
[3:30:38.860 --> 3:30:44.220]  trajectory of but its real target is confidence in the economy
[3:30:44.220 --> 3:30:48.140]  and that's why recognizing that it's an attempt to scare us in a submission is
[3:30:48.140 --> 3:30:51.100]  critical because then people will understand the real

[3:32:01.820 --> 3:32:06.780]  there is a massive awakening happening to the tyranny of big pharma and the
[3:32:06.780 --> 3:32:10.860]  medical mafia the force inoculations in the un
[3:32:10.860 --> 3:32:14.060]  admitting that vaccines are killing people and they've covered it up
[3:32:14.060 --> 3:32:17.980]  and everywhere i go i am just mobbed by folks on the street now
[3:32:17.980 --> 3:32:21.980]  even in leftist austin who used to attack me just a few years ago saying you
[3:32:21.980 --> 3:32:26.780]  were right about 5g 5g's killing us i looked it up
[3:32:26.780 --> 3:32:30.220]  it's causing cancer it destroys immunity
[3:32:30.220 --> 3:32:34.940]  it says that it makes it easier for viruses to attack people are really
[3:32:34.940 --> 3:32:38.780]  starting to wake up and they know they're under attack
[3:32:38.780 --> 3:32:42.780]  at a spiritual and subconscious cellular level
[3:32:42.780 --> 3:32:45.980]  so now my friends educate everyone you know
[3:32:45.980 --> 3:32:49.660]  they're ready to listen they're ready to learn they're ready to take action

[3:32:54.140 --> 3:32:59.740]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:11.740 --> 3:33:18.860]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's nick baggage
[3:33:18.860 --> 3:33:25.100]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:25.100 --> 3:33:29.020]  so glad to be with you on this uh friday afternoon
[3:33:29.020 --> 3:33:32.140]  i'm in most parts of the world still a little before noon in mind
[3:33:32.140 --> 3:33:35.980]  uh here in acreage alaska you know just before the break
[3:33:35.980 --> 3:33:39.740]  i was talking about uh this great idea my
[3:33:39.740 --> 3:33:44.860]  oldest son nicolas had in fact he's on the uh alaska policy form he's their
[3:33:44.860 --> 3:33:48.540]  chair which is a conservative think tank here in alaska and so this is now
[3:33:48.540 --> 3:33:52.220]  circulating among conservatives around the country and actually
[3:33:52.220 --> 3:33:57.180]  running up to my brother mark who's um on the liberal side of the family
[3:33:57.180 --> 3:34:00.380]  but he's actually co-chairing with um the previous
[3:34:00.380 --> 3:34:05.340]  governor of alaska senator uh or congress governor parnell excuse me and
[3:34:05.340 --> 3:34:09.740]  under our current governor dunlevy both of them are co-chairing an economic
[3:34:09.740 --> 3:34:13.580]  committee and fielding a number of ideas but here's the one for my son that i
[3:34:13.580 --> 3:34:16.540]  think is incredible and one that could apply to everyone
[3:34:16.540 --> 3:34:20.140]  instead of you know the zero percent that they're giving in treasuries and
[3:34:20.140 --> 3:34:24.060]  essentially giving bankers this total liquidity i have a different solution
[3:34:24.060 --> 3:34:29.100]  for liquidity and and it's this simply this is instead
[3:34:29.100 --> 3:34:34.940]  why not uh take um all the mortgages all the residential mortgages in america
[3:34:34.940 --> 3:34:39.340]  and rewrite them in a streamlined fashion think about this
[3:34:39.340 --> 3:34:43.500]  a half a point a half a percent or a quarter of a percent service the loan
[3:34:43.500 --> 3:34:47.260]  that's the interest rate but all your money now goes into principle
[3:34:47.260 --> 3:34:51.020]  and and and refinance it take out the entire mortgage industry instead of
[3:34:51.020 --> 3:34:55.180]  waiting till it defaults have a two month recess on starting those
[3:34:55.180 --> 3:34:58.300]  payments so people have the break and the breathing space
[3:34:58.300 --> 3:35:02.460]  and then essentially where you're paying straight into your equity
[3:35:02.460 --> 3:35:07.260]  not into interest for bankers but into equity let the federal reserve take out
[3:35:07.260 --> 3:35:10.300]  that debt and you know what it's a balance sheet equation because
[3:35:10.300 --> 3:35:14.860]  instead of just creating puff money out of nothing now you have real assets
[3:35:14.860 --> 3:35:19.420]  backing up a real debt instrument so it's in balance
[3:35:19.420 --> 3:35:22.620]  but instead of the bankers getting zero percent interest
[3:35:22.620 --> 3:35:26.380]  why don't we every mortgage holder that would knock out
[3:35:26.380 --> 3:35:30.140]  hundreds and hundreds of dollars out of your monthly expenses
[3:35:30.140 --> 3:35:35.420]  every month for the next 30 years and you could take this and apply it to
[3:35:35.420 --> 3:35:41.580]  multi multi-family units renters and take that savings that interest savings
[3:35:41.580 --> 3:35:46.300]  on those multi-unit residential properties that may face foreclosure
[3:35:46.300 --> 3:35:50.860]  and reduce the rent split it split it with the landlord and the tenants where
[3:35:50.860 --> 3:35:54.540]  that interest savings is split in a rental reduction
[3:35:54.540 --> 3:35:59.340]  and a real savings for the landlord and all that money by all those consumers
[3:35:59.340 --> 3:36:01.820]  and all those homeowners and all those renters
[3:36:01.820 --> 3:36:07.020]  that they save will go into the economy directly not put in stock buybacks for
[3:36:07.020 --> 3:36:10.540]  big banks and corporations like liquidity offers them today
[3:36:10.540 --> 3:36:16.540]  but a very different equation that lands the money in the hands of each of us
[3:36:16.540 --> 3:36:21.180]  in a way that changes our life not for a couple of months
[3:36:21.180 --> 3:36:25.500]  like some handout but in a very real way at the same level as the banks are
[3:36:25.500 --> 3:36:29.260]  being treated why not trade human beings at least
[3:36:29.260 --> 3:36:34.780]  equal to a dang bank where are we in this equation at the bottom
[3:36:34.780 --> 3:36:39.180]  or at the top the government is by the people of the people for the people in
[3:36:39.180 --> 3:36:42.700]  the Federal Reserve is of the bankers for the bankers and by the bankers
[3:36:42.700 --> 3:36:46.860]  and it's trying to assert the power of the people and re-equate
[3:36:46.860 --> 3:36:50.620]  a different kind of equation and this isn't uh
[3:36:50.620 --> 3:36:53.980]  some will say oh that's socialism that sounds like socialism well what is it
[3:36:53.980 --> 3:36:57.020]  for the banks right now when they get zero interest
[3:36:57.020 --> 3:37:00.300]  and they want to tax us for the banks to pay their bills when they're already
[3:37:00.300 --> 3:37:04.300]  getting 17 20 22 interest on your credit cards
[3:37:04.300 --> 3:37:07.500]  for god's sake and you know here's what it does
[3:37:07.500 --> 3:37:10.300]  all those mortgage bankers get all their money back
[3:37:10.300 --> 3:37:13.900]  and then they have it available to lend corporations to lend
[3:37:13.900 --> 3:37:17.580]  big businesses to give to the banks to flood the banks with liquidity
[3:37:17.580 --> 3:37:21.660]  and then they can take the risks instead of passing those risks onto you
[3:37:21.660 --> 3:37:24.700]  and stripping out our wealth in the form of interest
[3:37:24.700 --> 3:37:29.100]  which if you read the old testament interest was more or less a sin
[3:37:29.100 --> 3:37:33.500]  you know something about it this is a very
[3:37:33.500 --> 3:37:38.140]  different way to address the mortgage crisis that's coming
[3:37:38.140 --> 3:37:42.460]  and solve it and think about it every dime that you pay on your mortgage
[3:37:42.460 --> 3:37:47.420]  pass the taxes and insurance are going to go straight into equity into real
[3:37:47.420 --> 3:37:53.020]  value real well not toilet paper stock certificates
[3:37:53.020 --> 3:37:56.780]  you know it's real well and here's the other part of this idea
[3:37:56.780 --> 3:38:01.660]  and I think why it's so brilliant my son Nicholas was so brilliant in this is
[3:38:01.660 --> 3:38:07.020]  it's simple you charge a $500 origination fee roll it into the loan
[3:38:07.020 --> 3:38:10.460]  give a two-month break for payments so people can breathe everybody can breathe
[3:38:10.460 --> 3:38:12.620]  you can even give a rental relief for two months
[3:38:12.620 --> 3:38:15.740]  while you redo it while you reset that for the landlord
[3:38:15.740 --> 3:38:20.860]  do some things creatively but address people that's why I love this idea
[3:38:20.860 --> 3:38:25.180]  and it's balance assets balance the liability
[3:38:25.180 --> 3:38:28.620]  better than just creating puff money so it doesn't further
[3:38:28.620 --> 3:38:33.180]  tamp down the value of our dollar by creating a
[3:38:33.180 --> 3:38:37.660]  puff money again different way to look at it I challenge people to think about
[3:38:37.660 --> 3:38:40.620]  it and if you like this idea pass it on to those
[3:38:40.620 --> 3:38:44.780]  that might actually listen the other one I I read I can't I can't cite where I
[3:38:44.780 --> 3:38:48.860]  read it but it's brilliant our oil industry is in a free fall and it's
[3:38:48.860 --> 3:38:53.500]  going to crush Alaska Louisiana Texas and really the country and a fracking
[3:38:53.500 --> 3:38:55.900]  industry that's going to be completely debased
[3:38:55.900 --> 3:38:59.980]  the banks will fail the companies will fail and a whole bunch of
[3:38:59.980 --> 3:39:03.180]  living human beings that are not statistics will
[3:39:03.180 --> 3:39:07.260]  will be unemployed this can stop and I'll tell you how we can protect our
[3:39:07.260 --> 3:39:13.660]  domestic oil markets by setting an import threshold no imported
[3:39:13.660 --> 3:39:17.820]  oil under $50 a barrel and then supply and demand can come
[3:39:17.820 --> 3:39:21.980]  into equilibrium in the United States at 50 a barrel
[3:39:21.980 --> 3:39:25.820]  let the excess above 50 a barrel be collected in taxes
[3:39:25.820 --> 3:39:30.300]  this costs the federal government nothing to stabilize oil prices and create
[3:39:30.300 --> 3:39:33.900]  certainty in our markets yeah we're gonna have to look at how that affects
[3:39:33.900 --> 3:39:36.780]  the airline industry but right now they're not flying anywhere
[3:39:36.780 --> 3:39:40.380]  American Airlines just said they cut all all international traffic so all
[3:39:40.380 --> 3:39:44.060]  this left is domestic sometimes you have to protect your industries
[3:39:44.060 --> 3:39:46.940]  today is the day we can protect the oil industry by
[3:39:46.940 --> 3:39:51.180]  putting the cap at $50 that's not going to cripple us at the pumps
[3:39:51.180 --> 3:39:55.500]  but it'll set certainty if it can drop below that by all means but don't let
[3:39:55.500 --> 3:39:58.860]  one barrel come into this country when we know we can produce enough for
[3:39:58.860 --> 3:40:03.980]  domestic needs period and tell us over $50 a barrel
[3:40:03.980 --> 3:40:06.620]  then allow whatever comes in that's competitive enough
[3:40:06.620 --> 3:40:10.700]  but preserve our industry if it collapses a chain reacts through so many
[3:40:10.700 --> 3:40:13.820]  others we can do a couple creating
[3:40:13.820 --> 3:40:17.340]  things beyond the big helicopter money giveaways
[3:40:17.340 --> 3:40:20.780]  that lasts longer than a quarter that
[3:40:20.780 --> 3:40:25.180]  create a changed economy beyond bringing our industries back
[3:40:25.180 --> 3:40:31.820]  beyond preserving the American potential by recognizing we're about to let it go
[3:40:31.820 --> 3:40:37.740]  recapitalize the average person by putting wealth back in and on this caveat
[3:40:37.740 --> 3:40:42.220]  one of the other things that needs to happen is the fire hose of 401k is going
[3:40:42.220 --> 3:40:46.140]  in out of payrolls every week going into the stock market is one of the things
[3:40:46.140 --> 3:40:49.900]  that have overfueled it we need alternatives for people
[3:40:49.900 --> 3:40:54.380]  instead of the stock market because how can you keep throwing money at it and
[3:40:54.380 --> 3:40:57.820]  not expect it to overplay until the bubble forms and then it
[3:40:57.820 --> 3:41:01.980]  collapses and we're all the losers because the big guys the globalists
[3:41:01.980 --> 3:41:06.460]  play the game and they use this and they strip out our wealth every decade or so
[3:41:06.460 --> 3:41:12.140]  it has to stop so i propose another solution on the 401k plans modify them
[3:41:12.140 --> 3:41:15.820]  change the mortgages to what i'm suggesting and then allow
[3:41:15.820 --> 3:41:19.180]  people as part of their 401 for their match and their
[3:41:19.180 --> 3:41:22.700]  contribution or their Roth or their traditional IRAs
[3:41:22.700 --> 3:41:27.260]  to put it in their home equity provide a conduit into your home equity your
[3:41:27.260 --> 3:41:31.820]  personal wealth or into a home equity savings account so you one day
[3:41:31.820 --> 3:41:35.500]  can be a homeowner because that's the foundation and always has been of
[3:41:35.500 --> 3:41:38.300]  american wealth and before that it was your family
[3:41:38.300 --> 3:41:42.620]  farm and your house and before that it was the 160 acres that you used to be
[3:41:42.620 --> 3:41:47.340]  allowed to homestead out of public lands that ended in alaska
[3:41:47.340 --> 3:41:51.820]  federally for all american citizens that ended here in the early 70s the last
[3:41:51.820 --> 3:41:56.700]  bits of home setting went away you know we need to rethink the american
[3:41:56.700 --> 3:41:59.900]  dream by making sure it's not the bankers dream
[3:41:59.900 --> 3:42:04.140]  and our nightmare because a nightmare is in front of us right now
[3:42:04.140 --> 3:42:08.780]  big ideas different ideas ideas that change the game are being shoved down
[3:42:08.780 --> 3:42:12.940]  our throat by the dark side and it's time for a lighter side to see
[3:42:12.940 --> 3:42:17.260]  a way through the darkness and get us through the times that we're in
[3:42:17.260 --> 3:42:22.300]  with creative thinking the next segment i'm taking it all another direction
[3:42:22.300 --> 3:42:26.300]  because the only thing that changes the world is human beings and we are
[3:42:26.300 --> 3:42:31.020]  spiritual beings first before we're flesh and matter in this world
[3:42:31.020 --> 3:42:34.620]  and what i've talked about in this last segment is the fleshiness of the earth
[3:42:34.620 --> 3:42:38.380]  the things we have to contend with as physical beings but we're first
[3:42:38.380 --> 3:42:42.220]  spiritual beings and in the next segment i want to talk about that this is dr
[3:42:42.220 --> 3:43:08.940]  mick faggots we'll be right back
[3:43:08.940 --> 3:43:12.620]  for 26 years alex jones and info wars
[3:43:12.620 --> 3:43:16.860]  have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide
[3:43:16.860 --> 3:43:20.460]  waking people up to the new world order
[3:43:20.460 --> 3:43:27.500]  bohemian grove the american deep state the rise of communist china
[3:43:27.500 --> 3:43:33.980]  the plan for global depopulation and global elite pedophiles who pray off
[3:43:33.980 --> 3:43:37.340]  of our young the enemy has done their best to
[3:43:37.340 --> 3:43:42.220]  destroy us but because of your support our fight continues
[3:43:42.220 --> 3:43:45.980]  join us support the info war and together
[3:43:45.980 --> 3:43:51.580]  we will slay the dragon keep fighting out here the gladiator
[3:43:51.580 --> 3:43:55.820]  i don't want to sit here and say see i told you so so people say oh
[3:43:55.820 --> 3:44:00.700]  alex jones is so smart oh he's so great i can hear less about that
[3:44:00.700 --> 3:44:05.660]  i want you to understand that back in mid january during a whole fake
[3:44:05.660 --> 3:44:10.060]  impeachment fiasco and the rest of it i was pointing out that
[3:44:10.060 --> 3:44:13.580]  the big issue would be the next move the next time
[3:44:13.580 --> 3:44:16.860]  the globals were going to launch they knew that you'd have to vote back then
[3:44:16.860 --> 3:44:21.340]  and i said we'd be an attack on the economy because criminals love to brag
[3:44:21.340 --> 3:44:25.980]  and they were telegraphing the entire thing and now here we are ladies and
[3:44:25.980 --> 3:44:30.140]  gentlemen our economy shut down for over a month certain depression if it
[3:44:30.140 --> 3:44:34.940]  continues more than a month and a half or so maybe even shorter
[3:44:34.940 --> 3:44:38.140]  and americans have failed the test they have gotten
[3:44:38.140 --> 3:44:41.980]  into the fear they've enjoyed not going into work it's been a new
[3:44:41.980 --> 3:44:47.500]  drama and the globals are saying hell let's destroy their way of life forever
[3:44:47.500 --> 3:44:50.620]  let's kill their confidence and give them a depression people better wake up
[3:44:50.620 --> 3:44:53.420]  now
[3:44:53.420 --> 3:44:57.660]  as men age they often experience a slowdown
[3:44:57.660 --> 3:45:02.940]  in vitality energy and overall wellness
[3:45:02.940 --> 3:45:06.860]  and that's why we made one of our most popular formulas

[3:47:23.980 --> 3:47:28.780]  and uh welcome back and i want to remind people on my books and videos are
[3:47:28.780 --> 3:47:33.740]  exclusively actually exclusively in print form available
[3:47:33.740 --> 3:47:38.380]  at the info wars store dot com i want to remind people it's a way to support
[3:47:38.380 --> 3:47:43.020]  my work and also support the work of info wars and everyone on our team
[3:47:43.020 --> 3:47:47.260]  and i got to say this you know we got a great team all the way around
[3:47:47.260 --> 3:47:54.060]  austin at the warehouse shipping every single position from from from
[3:47:54.060 --> 3:47:57.980]  editing all of it it's incredible the team that's been put together there
[3:47:57.980 --> 3:48:01.740]  to keep the public informed at this particular time you know in this segment
[3:48:01.740 --> 3:48:07.260]  i want to get into a totally different configuration here in terms of
[3:48:07.260 --> 3:48:14.300]  um how we see this okay because as human beings as created human beings and i
[3:48:14.300 --> 3:48:17.500]  and some people may fall away in the listening audience on this because i'm
[3:48:17.500 --> 3:48:22.540]  going to come from a spiritual perspective because i think that's
[3:48:22.540 --> 3:48:26.940]  important and whether you're a christian or whether you're consider yourself some
[3:48:26.940 --> 3:48:32.460]  other kind of a religious person but if you believe in the connectivity of the
[3:48:32.460 --> 3:48:37.900]  spirit and what it is i want to talk to you now and i want to suggest a few
[3:48:37.900 --> 3:48:40.860]  things and alex will tell you and he's told you before
[3:48:40.860 --> 3:48:44.940]  this is one of the areas of the mind the spirit the consciousness the energy
[3:48:44.940 --> 3:48:49.980]  that we are is the center of what has been my research but from a pragmatic
[3:48:49.980 --> 3:48:53.900]  or sort of science perspective but let's look at it from the
[3:48:53.900 --> 3:48:58.940]  of physics perspective all right and the bio physics tells us that
[3:48:58.940 --> 3:49:02.460]  we in fact are the outward expression of energy
[3:49:02.460 --> 3:49:06.940]  ultimately which is if you think about this what words are what they represent
[3:49:06.940 --> 3:49:11.020]  our symbols for thought so we can go back to the ancient words
[3:49:11.020 --> 3:49:14.700]  i'm talking about what we were has created human beings created in the image
[3:49:14.700 --> 3:49:19.340]  of likeness of god from my perspective that says a lot more than our
[3:49:19.340 --> 3:49:24.540]  physical form which we're also told are finite and limited it is a grain of
[3:49:24.540 --> 3:49:28.220]  this lifetime in terms of scope is like a
[3:49:28.220 --> 3:49:33.500]  a bit of a bit of dust on a grain of sand on the beach of the universe okay
[3:49:33.500 --> 3:49:38.540]  this amount of time here in the scope of eternity is very small and very short
[3:49:38.540 --> 3:49:43.180]  no matter how agonizing or how glorious it might be
[3:49:43.180 --> 3:49:46.540]  from your perspective in the body that you occupy
[3:49:46.540 --> 3:49:51.100]  so energetically if we start there and that's what we are
[3:49:51.100 --> 3:49:55.180]  when you think about what affects our health changes in our energy states which
[3:49:55.180 --> 3:49:59.260]  is what alex was eluding to earlier in that last segment and what
[3:49:59.260 --> 3:50:03.420]  science has tried to explain from a biophysics perspective
[3:50:03.420 --> 3:50:08.380]  the split in physiology and in life sciences happened
[3:50:08.380 --> 3:50:12.620]  when the the guys really sharpen mathematics they sort of drifted to the
[3:50:12.620 --> 3:50:16.380]  biophysics and those not so good in the math but good in the chemistry
[3:50:16.380 --> 3:50:19.580]  followed the chemical models but there is no chemical reaction
[3:50:19.580 --> 3:50:23.740]  without an energetic reaction which is the the biophysics is in fact the
[3:50:23.740 --> 3:50:29.260]  foundation of all life sciences as we understand them today so energy as an
[3:50:29.260 --> 3:50:32.540]  input and energy as an output is fundamental
[3:50:32.540 --> 3:50:36.380]  to what we are as living human beings and no system is closed we're all
[3:50:36.380 --> 3:50:38.860]  interlinked this is something that we now know also
[3:50:38.860 --> 3:50:42.780]  and there's something in quantum physics called non locality where once we connect
[3:50:42.780 --> 3:50:46.300]  with each other you affect everything instantaneously
[3:50:46.300 --> 3:50:50.220]  there's something called the news sphere which has been actually measured
[3:50:50.220 --> 3:50:54.860]  that shows that the entire energetic composition of the planet's
[3:50:54.860 --> 3:50:58.860]  awareness which is all of us individually collectively
[3:50:58.860 --> 3:51:06.540]  think about this create an energy field that changes reality
[3:51:06.540 --> 3:51:11.340]  this is quantum physics and not just some mystical conversation
[3:51:11.340 --> 3:51:14.860]  this is why it blurs so much dialogue between
[3:51:14.860 --> 3:51:19.580]  consciousness and science today starts to get really blurry
[3:51:19.580 --> 3:51:23.820]  the power of two or more gathered together
[3:51:23.820 --> 3:51:28.060]  is immense this is called resonance in science
[3:51:28.060 --> 3:51:31.180]  resonance if you were to write out the equation it would be
[3:51:31.180 --> 3:51:38.620]  x plus x in brackets and then a squaring of that in other words
[3:51:38.620 --> 3:51:44.140]  that times itself so this is greater than the sum of the total
[3:51:44.140 --> 3:51:47.420]  it's physics it's also the mystery of the words
[3:51:47.420 --> 3:51:53.820]  two or more gathered together because the more you link in this chain
[3:51:53.820 --> 3:51:58.460]  the more powerful the amplitude of the signal because of this thing called
[3:51:58.460 --> 3:52:03.420]  resonance which is harmonies between living souls
[3:52:03.420 --> 3:52:07.100]  we can actually do this we do this right now
[3:52:07.100 --> 3:52:11.660]  we do this in everything we do when we come together in common moments like
[3:52:11.660 --> 3:52:14.220]  this where we're hearing each other and listening
[3:52:14.220 --> 3:52:18.540]  we come together in common moments and reality begins to be created by how we
[3:52:18.540 --> 3:52:22.700]  intellectualize and emotionalize what we see and then how we begin to act
[3:52:22.700 --> 3:52:26.300]  accordingly when when the when the dark forces in the
[3:52:26.300 --> 3:52:31.500]  world use cnn and the mainstream media to create the same effect
[3:52:31.500 --> 3:52:37.100]  they know what they're doing this isn't like a mystery or an accident
[3:52:37.100 --> 3:52:40.700]  the idea of concentrating focused energy
[3:52:40.700 --> 3:52:44.540]  stimulating fear which is an activating energy
[3:52:44.540 --> 3:52:50.140]  but without the logic engaged allows people to be moved like a herd
[3:52:50.140 --> 3:52:54.300]  now the opposite of this is called focused
[3:52:54.300 --> 3:52:58.220]  prayer all right you can call it prayer we'll call it prayer today
[3:52:58.220 --> 3:53:03.580]  for lack of a better common word but it's focused attention
[3:53:03.580 --> 3:53:06.540]  and this is what it what it says in the science
[3:53:06.540 --> 3:53:09.980]  you hold the thought most people only hold the thought for a couple of seconds
[3:53:09.980 --> 3:53:13.100]  and it dissipates right you drift off start thinking about 50 million other
[3:53:13.100 --> 3:53:16.300]  things the longer you hold the thought the more able
[3:53:16.300 --> 3:53:20.940]  you are to push that thought into reality creation that's how it
[3:53:20.940 --> 3:53:24.860]  works okay now prayer two or more gathered god knowing we can't hold our
[3:53:24.860 --> 3:53:27.740]  focus you get people linked up in all those
[3:53:27.740 --> 3:53:31.580]  seconds that add up in the same seconds to something powerful in other words
[3:53:31.580 --> 3:53:33.900]  think about this a million people holding a thought
[3:53:33.900 --> 3:53:39.100]  for three or four seconds long as we can but now you have three or four million
[3:53:39.100 --> 3:53:43.340]  seconds in those three seconds that's the compounding of it that's
[3:53:43.340 --> 3:53:48.780]  resonance this is when prayer has an effect in reality
[3:53:48.780 --> 3:53:51.740]  and it's not a big mystery it's just science
[3:53:51.740 --> 3:53:57.900]  but with the power of understanding what prayer does then we have a more focused
[3:53:57.900 --> 3:54:00.780]  possibility because here's what faith is i want to
[3:54:00.780 --> 3:54:03.740]  mention this faith and hope there's a big distinction between two and people
[3:54:03.740 --> 3:54:07.340]  confuse them faith is knowing what is true
[3:54:07.340 --> 3:54:12.220]  and acting on it doing something actively we each can do that
[3:54:12.220 --> 3:54:16.300]  and so i at some point before we run out of time today i'm going to ask everyone
[3:54:16.300 --> 3:54:20.300]  for just 10 seconds to hold with me the thought
[3:54:20.300 --> 3:54:22.940]  and this is the thought that we're going to come back to and i'm mentioning it
[3:54:22.940 --> 3:54:25.660]  now so you can decide whether you want to participate or not
[3:54:25.660 --> 3:54:29.660]  and it's to give clarity to president trump
[3:54:29.660 --> 3:54:33.180]  to know what will truly help this
[3:54:33.180 --> 3:54:37.500]  this this country in the right way in a good way
[3:54:37.500 --> 3:54:40.940]  in a way that every american can be proud of that's what i'm going to be
[3:54:40.940 --> 3:54:44.700]  asking us to do at that moment because this is something
[3:54:44.700 --> 3:54:48.860]  that maybe just maybe if you believe in god
[3:54:48.860 --> 3:54:53.180]  or you don't and you believe in physics we can do this together
[3:54:53.180 --> 3:54:57.820]  we can do this together we can all do this for 10 seconds
[3:54:57.820 --> 3:55:01.740]  and and i'm going to do and i'm going to speak the words and i'm going to ask
[3:55:01.740 --> 3:55:05.500]  you all to hold this thought now i'm going to go into this
[3:55:05.500 --> 3:55:11.500]  i i am asking every person to focus for this 10 seconds
[3:55:11.500 --> 3:55:17.180]  on this president gaining the wisdom necessary to make the right decisions
[3:55:17.180 --> 3:55:21.580]  that every american would be proud of that will change this world that will
[3:55:21.580 --> 3:55:25.180]  change this country and liberate us from the
[3:55:25.180 --> 3:55:28.780]  captivity that otherwise is going to be thrust upon us
[3:55:28.780 --> 3:55:42.460]  let this be our focus for this 10 second
[3:55:42.460 --> 3:55:46.140]  hey thanks for doing that you know i think that is a powerful thing
[3:55:46.140 --> 3:55:49.740]  and and i would ask people to listen to this video later to join us even in that
[3:55:49.740 --> 3:55:53.820]  moment recognizing something out about physics
[3:55:53.820 --> 3:55:58.620]  time and space only have existence in this reality otherwise they don't exist
[3:55:58.620 --> 3:56:03.020]  in the way we think about them so wherever you join us in that 10 seconds
[3:56:03.020 --> 3:56:08.140]  let that 10 seconds spread and let us recognize the science
[3:56:08.140 --> 3:56:14.060]  behind all of this and let us take ourselves back we're all locked in you
[3:56:14.060 --> 3:56:18.700]  know focused on what's going on in our own personal lives this is a good thing
[3:56:18.700 --> 3:56:23.180]  i've said trauma sometimes braids great opportunity and i mentioned it before
[3:56:23.180 --> 3:56:27.580]  in a video i did called breaking the zombie trance which is still linked
[3:56:27.580 --> 3:56:34.220]  on on my website at earthpulse.com but traumas offer opportunity and and
[3:56:34.220 --> 3:56:38.220]  as difficult and painful as all of this is the opportunity is to first reflect
[3:56:38.220 --> 3:56:41.820]  inside and recognize what we are again creating the
[3:56:41.820 --> 3:56:45.420]  image and likeness of god that is a powerful being
[3:56:45.420 --> 3:56:49.660]  you are that being you are that powerful created entity
[3:56:49.660 --> 3:56:53.740]  that can walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil
[3:56:53.740 --> 3:56:58.140]  and we are there right now and we are not alone we are actually connected to
[3:56:58.140 --> 3:57:01.180]  every other living soul by the fact of creation
[3:57:01.180 --> 3:57:04.140]  and we're doing this together we're in this together
[3:57:04.140 --> 3:57:07.340]  these are the opportunities that change us internally
[3:57:07.340 --> 3:57:11.740]  and then that changes the external world i've been talking about it for years
[3:57:11.740 --> 3:57:15.180]  in the context of technology in the context of science
[3:57:15.180 --> 3:57:18.220]  but more importantly in the context of who we are
[3:57:18.220 --> 3:57:23.500]  as living breathing souls unite together in the opportunity to serve
[3:57:23.500 --> 3:57:28.220]  serve each other and change the world and recognize who we are
[3:57:28.220 --> 3:57:33.500]  and act that way courageously fearlessly we are the info warriors
[3:57:33.500 --> 3:57:57.500]  and you are the tip of the shooting
