[00:00.000 --> 00:15.320]  More than simply for physical health, the Dow Jones average fell more than 2,000 points
[00:15.320 --> 00:16.320]  today.
[00:16.320 --> 00:17.320]  That's a decline of more than 7.5%.
[00:17.320 --> 00:21.280]  It was the market's worst day since the 2008 financial crisis.
[00:21.280 --> 00:24.760]  It was the fourth worst day since the Great Depression.
[00:24.760 --> 00:28.080]  Grant Thornton, a major accounting firm, is predicting a global recession due to this
[00:28.080 --> 00:32.520]  epidemic, and very low growth, if any, here in the United States.
[00:32.520 --> 00:36.300]  If a recession does hit, it will not be so simple to fight it.
[00:36.300 --> 00:40.680]  The usual stimulus efforts, tax cuts and lower rates, won't reopen factories that have shut
[00:40.680 --> 00:42.000]  down to contain a virus.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.280]  It won't get people to eat at closed restaurants or shop in closed malls or attend canceled
[00:46.280 --> 00:47.280]  sporting events.
[00:47.280 --> 00:50.520]  We're going to have a demand problem in this economy.
[00:50.520 --> 00:51.520]  And that's a big deal.
[00:51.520 --> 00:55.840]  In other words, our country is likely to experience a painful period where we are powerless to
[00:55.840 --> 00:56.840]  stop.
[00:56.840 --> 00:59.840]  None of this is justification to panic, you shouldn't panic.
[00:59.840 --> 01:02.840]  In crisis, it's more important than ever to be calm.
[01:02.840 --> 01:06.200]  But staying calm is not the same as remaining complacent.
[01:06.200 --> 01:09.400]  It does not mean assuring people that everything will be fine.
[01:09.400 --> 01:10.400]  We don't know that.
[01:10.400 --> 01:12.740]  Instead, it's better to tell the truth.
[01:12.740 --> 01:15.680]  That is always the surest sign of strength.
[01:15.680 --> 01:19.320]  As they level with us, our leaders ought to prepare the public for what may come next.
[01:19.320 --> 01:23.060]  If a recession is coming, we need to save money for the possible effect of that.
[01:23.060 --> 01:25.480]  If travel restrictions are coming, we should know that too.
[01:25.480 --> 01:29.440]  Already, the nonstop acela train service between New York and Washington, which is critical
[01:29.440 --> 01:31.840]  to a lot of people, has been suspended.
[01:31.840 --> 01:35.480]  The Indian Wells Tennis Tournament in California, one of the largest in the world, has been
[01:35.480 --> 01:36.640]  canceled for this year.
[01:36.640 --> 01:40.240]  The March Madness Basketball Tournament is supposed to start in a couple of weeks, but
[01:40.240 --> 01:44.800]  it could be held in front of empty stands or postponed or canceled as well.
[01:44.800 --> 01:48.760]  In the end, you may be given the option to work from home, but eventually may be ordered
[01:48.760 --> 01:50.320]  to do that.
[01:50.320 --> 01:51.640]  You should know.
[01:51.640 --> 01:55.080]  We should also focus on preparing our health care system for the worst.
[01:55.080 --> 01:59.440]  The time of containing coronavirus with widespread testing and individual quarantines, blocking
[01:59.440 --> 02:02.040]  the borders, useful, but that time is over.
[02:02.040 --> 02:03.720]  There are too many cases here now.
[02:03.720 --> 02:05.720]  We cannot stop this epidemic.
[02:05.720 --> 02:07.880]  We can only limit the damage that it does.
[02:07.880 --> 02:11.000]  Now, it's also the time to start looking ahead to the future.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.640]  Think about what it would mean to face a deadlier version of coronavirus.
[02:15.640 --> 02:16.760]  It's not unimaginable.
[02:16.760 --> 02:18.280]  It's very easy to imagine.
[02:18.280 --> 02:19.280]  Are we ready for that?
[02:19.280 --> 02:20.560]  We're not ready now.
[02:20.560 --> 02:21.560]  We ought to be.
[02:21.560 --> 02:25.240]  One of the first things we can do to prepare ourselves is break our dependence on China
[02:25.240 --> 02:27.720]  for essential medical supplies.
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.920]  Last week, China's official news service published a piece gloating that the country has brought
[02:31.920 --> 02:34.120]  coronavirus under control.
[02:34.120 --> 02:38.160]  The story claims the rest of the world should apologize to China for criticizing the country
[02:38.160 --> 02:41.800]  over the virus and then drops this not very subtle warning.
[02:41.800 --> 02:45.880]  Quote, if China retaliates against the United States at this time, in addition to announcing
[02:45.880 --> 02:50.760]  a travel ban on the United States, it will also announce strategic control over medical
[02:50.760 --> 02:54.520]  products and ban exports to the United States.
[02:54.520 --> 02:59.160]  If China announces that its drugs are for domestic use and bans exports, the United States will
[02:59.160 --> 03:02.760]  fall into the hell of a new coronavirus epidemic.
[03:02.760 --> 03:08.960]  In other words, they're threatening to kill us, and that's not an empty threat.
[03:08.960 --> 03:14.320]  We really are that dependent on China for masks and medical equipment, for basic medicines,
[03:14.320 --> 03:16.560]  for pharmaceuticals of all kinds.
[03:16.560 --> 03:21.800]  It is shocking to wake up one morning and find ourselves in this supine position, dependent
[03:21.800 --> 03:23.720]  on a country that hates us.
[03:23.720 --> 03:27.720]  The people who did it, who made us this dependent on a hostile foreign power, deserve to be
[03:27.720 --> 03:29.480]  punished for what they did.
[03:29.480 --> 03:31.200]  That won't happen, probably.
[03:31.200 --> 03:34.720]  But at least we can try to fix the damage they caused, and there's a lot of it.
[03:34.720 --> 03:37.160]  The Chinese coronavirus will get worse.
[03:37.160 --> 03:39.640]  Its effects will be far more disruptive than they are right now.
[03:39.640 --> 03:40.640]  That is not a guess.
[03:40.640 --> 03:43.440]  It is inevitable, no matter what they're telling you.
[03:43.440 --> 03:46.960]  Let's hope everyone stops lying about that, and soon.
[03:46.960 --> 03:55.880]  Well, that's what you call a perfect statement of reality, reasonable, measured, and pointing
[03:55.880 --> 03:59.280]  out the chai-com supply most of our drugs and are gloating about it, threatening to
[03:59.280 --> 04:00.280]  cut us off.
[04:00.280 --> 04:02.000]  It's just incredible.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.520]  And that's just one piece of all of this.
[04:04.520 --> 04:11.280]  Thank you for joining us on this March 10th, Tuesday global transmission, 327 days out
[04:11.280 --> 04:13.520]  from the historic election.
[04:13.520 --> 04:15.920]  Wow, so much crazy stuff is going on.
[04:15.920 --> 04:18.920]  The listeners have really liked the calls.
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.280]  We had a decent job of taking a lot of calls, but still didn't get to as many as I wanted
[04:23.280 --> 04:24.400]  to.
[04:24.400 --> 04:29.440]  And so we're going to open the phones up, and we're going to take calls throughout the
[04:29.440 --> 04:34.120]  broadcast today until Paul Joseph Watson hosts the fourth hour ahead of the war room
[04:34.120 --> 04:35.120]  with Elmer Schreuer.
[04:35.120 --> 04:39.360]  We just had a kick-butt, David Night Show, on, I was watching some of that this morning
[04:39.360 --> 04:41.360]  getting ready for the transmission.
[04:41.360 --> 04:42.960]  I haven't had any sleep tonight.
[04:42.960 --> 04:43.960]  I tried.
[04:43.960 --> 04:45.600]  No sleep last night.
[04:45.600 --> 04:49.680]  I'll tell you about that, too, that's an interesting story, very informative.
[04:49.680 --> 04:54.360]  Talk about a bird's-eye view from a very interesting place.
[04:54.360 --> 04:59.600]  So it's a big transmission today, you don't want to miss it.
[04:59.600 --> 05:05.960]  Across the Western world, from high school to college sports to even the Olympics, men,
[05:05.960 --> 05:11.000]  biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[05:11.000 --> 05:17.560]  This is men invading women's faces and bullying them and taking their rights away, all in
[05:17.560 --> 05:19.960]  the name of the liberalism and openness.
[05:19.960 --> 05:26.240]  And then every day I have stacks of news articles, just like today, UK team find under house arrest
[05:26.240 --> 05:30.440]  for asking trans police officers gender, and it hurt their feelings.
[05:30.440 --> 05:37.520]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay Â£1,000 fine because
[05:37.520 --> 05:42.560]  it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[05:42.560 --> 05:44.040]  That's the thought police.
[05:44.040 --> 05:49.240]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[05:49.240 --> 05:53.840]  This is tyranny, these people are bullies, and it's sick, and it's evil, and it's part
[05:53.840 --> 05:57.080]  of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[05:57.080 --> 05:58.960]  Resist it, speak out against it.
[05:58.960 --> 06:00.960]  You've got it.
[06:00.960 --> 06:07.040]  That Christmas is coming soon.
[06:07.040 --> 06:09.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:09.360 --> 06:18.720]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:18.720 --> 06:34.400]  Task Force, we had the opportunity to brief the President today on a broad range of issues.
[06:34.400 --> 06:41.080]  And once again, because of the unprecedented action that President Trump took in January,
[06:41.080 --> 06:50.080]  sending all travel from China, establishing travel advisories for portions of South Korea
[06:50.080 --> 06:56.880]  and Italy, establishing screening of all direct flights, all passengers from all airports,
[06:56.880 --> 07:05.840]  Italy and South Korea, we have bought a considerable amount of time according to all the health
[07:05.840 --> 07:09.080]  experts to deal with the coronavirus here in the United States.
[07:09.080 --> 07:17.560]  In fact, as I stand before you today, the risk of contracting the coronavirus to the
[07:17.560 --> 07:24.760]  American public remains low, and the risk of serious disease among the American public
[07:24.760 --> 07:26.800]  also remains low.
[07:26.800 --> 07:33.040]  That being said, the President did deploy not just a whole-of-government approach, but
[07:33.040 --> 07:36.520]  also a whole-of-America approach.
[07:36.520 --> 07:40.880]  And last week, at the President's direction, we met with leaders in industries from nursing
[07:40.880 --> 07:47.680]  homes to airlines, pharmaceutical companies, commercial labs, and it's had great, great
[07:47.680 --> 07:49.040]  impact.
[07:49.040 --> 07:54.280]  Pharmaceutical companies are already working literally around the clock on the development
[07:54.280 --> 07:58.760]  of therapeutics that will be medicines that can bring relief to people that contract the
[07:58.760 --> 08:00.800]  coronavirus.
[08:00.800 --> 08:05.840]  And I know how pleased the President was to learn that the commercial labs in this country,
[08:05.840 --> 08:12.960]  led by companies like LabCorp and Quest, have already brought a test forward and are taking
[08:12.960 --> 08:17.280]  that to market effective today.
[08:17.280 --> 08:22.640]  This week, the President's direction will be meeting with hospital CEOs, health insurance
[08:22.640 --> 08:28.080]  CEOs, and all building on top of what the President will be announcing tomorrow with
[08:28.080 --> 08:32.160]  regard to economic relief for working Americans.
[08:32.160 --> 08:36.920]  We also met today in a conference call with 47 of America's governors.
[08:36.920 --> 08:41.920]  We were able to brief them on the latest, the progress that we've made.
[08:41.920 --> 08:49.200]  We were able to confirm with them that testing is now available in all state labs in every
[08:49.200 --> 08:50.880]  state in the country.
[08:50.880 --> 08:55.520]  Over a million tests have been distributed before the end of this week, and other 4 million
[08:55.520 --> 08:56.920]  tests will be distributed.
[08:56.920 --> 09:04.800]  But as I said before, with the deployment of the commercial labs, we literally are going
[09:04.800 --> 09:13.920]  to see a dramatic increase in the availability of testing, and that's all a direct result.
[09:13.920 --> 09:15.600]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[09:15.600 --> 09:19.160]  I thought we should hear from Tucker Carlson in the first little segment and now from the
[09:19.160 --> 09:20.160]  Vice President.
[09:20.160 --> 09:25.400]  Tucker Carlson, I'm very tempted to re-air that little three and a half minutes again
[09:25.400 --> 09:30.760]  at the bottom of the hour, because I'm not here in the Tucker Carlson ass-kissing gallery.
[09:30.760 --> 09:33.520]  Like, I used to not like Tucker Carlson.
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.480]  Back when he was on CNN, I was more libertarian-esque, not really hardcore, but he's really matured
[09:38.480 --> 09:41.000]  into a de-thoroughbred.
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.080]  And I know he writes his own stuff for his teleprompter, and I know him in person.
[09:46.080 --> 09:52.320]  He's that smart in person, and he just, he perfectly summed it up last night.
[09:52.320 --> 09:53.800]  And it's really hard to top that.
[09:53.800 --> 09:57.480]  I mean, I can get all the minutiae, we'll take your calls, we'll bring in a lot of angles,
[09:57.480 --> 10:04.520]  but this is a big deal, and Communist China supplies the majority of our pharmaceuticals,
[10:04.520 --> 10:10.520]  and most of them are tainted and toxic, and they also hammer us with enough fentanyl to
[10:10.520 --> 10:14.920]  kill the entire world over and over again with an overdose.
[10:14.920 --> 10:19.400]  So that's the level of stuff that's going on, and I'm not just trying to make Communist
[10:19.400 --> 10:21.440]  China the bogeyman.
[10:21.440 --> 10:27.320]  Communist China, in their own admissions, has killed over 100 million people.
[10:27.320 --> 10:31.800]  Communist China has aborted over 400 million babies, most of them little girls.
[10:31.800 --> 10:36.400]  Communist China is the model of the globalist surveillance grid right now all over the world,
[10:36.400 --> 10:43.280]  and is being adopted, and is rolling out teams to teach big tech how to surveil better, and
[10:43.280 --> 10:46.880]  how to surveil people for coronavirus, like they're the savior of the planet.
[10:46.880 --> 10:49.360]  It's disgusting.
[10:49.360 --> 10:52.880]  You take a man-made virus that leaks out of Wuhan, the Senate Intelligence Committee
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.400]  members have come out and said that's what the evidence shows, and somehow that turns
[10:57.400 --> 11:04.280]  them into the victims, and turns the chai comms into the good guys when we just saw something
[11:04.280 --> 11:10.640]  out of a science fiction zombie movie with what they did to their own population.
[11:10.640 --> 11:14.200]  So I'm going to cover all the latest developments on that front, give the number out here in
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.520]  just a moment, and then start taking your calls, because it's very informative in all the different
[11:18.520 --> 11:19.520]  angles you come up with.
[11:19.520 --> 11:24.800]  Any subjects you want to cover, long-time listeners, first-time callers, long-time callers, it's
[11:24.800 --> 11:35.800]  a free-for-all on this Tuesday global transmission, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[11:35.800 --> 11:40.600]  Something very interesting happened this morning, I was talking to one of the crew members
[11:40.600 --> 11:45.280]  from another part of the building, and he was like, you know, there's a rumor in the office
[11:45.280 --> 11:50.920]  that you use cocaine, because there's no way you can be so tired during a break and then
[11:50.920 --> 11:55.920]  explode, you know, once you come back on air.
[11:55.920 --> 11:58.480]  Well, that's what I do.
[11:58.480 --> 12:05.680]  I care passionately about this, and the reason Inforism has been so successful is excitement
[12:05.680 --> 12:14.720]  is contagious, adrenaline and endorphins and focused anger is a drug.
[12:14.720 --> 12:18.560]  It's a drug I use, it's a drug I'm addicted to, and it's a drug that I'm trying to get
[12:18.560 --> 12:20.280]  off of.
[12:20.280 --> 12:24.760]  That's the drug I'm on is hatred of devil worshipers and pedophiles, and it's an important
[12:24.760 --> 12:31.360]  drug, it's why God gave it to us, but at the same time, I've got too much of it.
[12:31.360 --> 12:32.360]  I've got too much of it.
[12:32.360 --> 12:35.960]  I don't want to die of a heart attack, you know, at 50, because I'm 46, man, and it's,
[12:35.960 --> 12:40.280]  you know, it's in my family's background, alpha male, super successful at everything,
[12:40.280 --> 12:43.320]  gigantic, spectacular heart attacks at 55, they're gone.
[12:43.320 --> 12:46.160]  And others learn how to chill out before then, they live to be 90.
[12:46.160 --> 12:51.120]  I want to be those guys that lived in 90, hell, some of them 100, but it's hard.
[12:51.120 --> 12:57.360]  But then I see other people that don't care at all.
[12:57.360 --> 13:03.920]  I see other people that just don't think anything matters and they're dead.
[13:03.920 --> 13:10.920]  And it's better to be alive and burn twice as bright than to be basically a dim bulb
[13:10.920 --> 13:14.320]  that is never awake, never cares, never has passions, and that's why I talk about the
[13:14.320 --> 13:15.320]  man in the arena.
[13:15.320 --> 13:20.440]  But that's why the left always says Alex Jones, the cokehead, Alex Jones, the drug addict,
[13:20.440 --> 13:29.360]  Alex Jones, this Alex Jones, that and it's because they don't have that type of passion.
[13:29.360 --> 13:34.320]  They don't have that drive so they can't imagine somebody that can broadcast 10 hours a day
[13:34.320 --> 13:39.080]  or they need to and love it and want to come back at night and do more because they don't
[13:39.080 --> 13:42.880]  have that spark that sets fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[13:42.880 --> 13:50.360]  But I know you have that spark and you have that focus and that's what we need more of.
[13:50.360 --> 13:51.360]  Turns things around.
[13:51.360 --> 13:54.680]  You know, that's why last year I was a good boy for, I don't know, over four months didn't
[13:54.680 --> 13:58.800]  have one drink, lost a whole bunch of weight, exercised better, felt so much good and then
[13:58.800 --> 14:01.560]  Christmas came around, sort of drinking again a little bit.
[14:01.560 --> 14:06.520]  And I'm now endeavor just 100% quit forever just because it takes my focus away.
[14:06.520 --> 14:13.240]  But I take depressants, I mean, I take natural knockout at night to help sleep.
[14:13.240 --> 14:15.120]  That's a depressant, natural depressant.
[14:15.120 --> 14:22.520]  I drink alcohol to not, you know, care because I care too much and I take it to take the
[14:22.520 --> 14:27.000]  focus away, to take the clarity away because I can't handle reality.
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  But you know what?
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.480]  That's me being honest about it, that I go and hide in places like that.
[14:32.480 --> 14:37.060]  But other people, they just don't give a damn, so why doesn't even matter to them.
[14:37.060 --> 14:38.460]  But I do care.
[14:38.460 --> 14:40.800]  And I care about having integrity.
[14:40.800 --> 14:44.580]  And that's why the system constantly says Alex Jones is a fake.
[14:44.580 --> 14:48.760]  Alex Jones is a phony, Alex Jones isn't having integrity, Alex Jones is lawyer, says that
[14:48.760 --> 14:50.880]  he is a actor.
[14:50.880 --> 14:54.120]  None of that's true.
[14:54.120 --> 14:59.360]  They were trying to, enter his evidence that I was insane in a joker makeup saying, put
[14:59.360 --> 15:01.880]  floor on the water, I was doing a satire piece.
[15:01.880 --> 15:06.680]  I was being an actor there, but I'm not an actor when I'm on the show being Alex Jones
[15:06.680 --> 15:12.680]  myself as a father and a man and as a Christian and as a human telling the truth.
[15:12.680 --> 15:16.120]  So the globalist are great at stealing our identity saying we're racist saying we're
[15:16.120 --> 15:17.120]  bad.
[15:17.120 --> 15:18.120]  It's not true.
[15:18.120 --> 15:20.960]  I care about humanity.
[15:20.960 --> 15:22.960]  And I will not let them steal my identity.
[15:22.960 --> 15:26.560]  And that's why it's so important for all of you to be vocal and all of you to be involved
[15:26.560 --> 15:28.360]  because they want to steal your identity.

[15:34.560 --> 15:35.560]  as well.
[15:35.560 --> 15:40.240]  Don't let Ursula take your voice like she did the Little Mermaid and make one of those
[15:40.240 --> 15:42.360]  little slaves down in her pit.

[19:06.240 --> 19:11.560]  toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit and I had my phone I had my show
[19:11.560 --> 19:15.440]  going on sticking on my pocket so I could hear it I wasn't even headphones this lady
[19:15.440 --> 19:19.640]  starts to who's who are you listening to who's that talking I said this is Alex Jones and
[19:19.640 --> 19:24.240]  she just got her eyes got wide open and she says I'm really I thought he was off the air
[19:24.240 --> 19:29.120]  and I said no and I told her I explained you know the whole situation and told her where
[19:29.120 --> 19:33.240]  to go she wrote down you know band dot video and also info words dot com and just said
[19:33.240 --> 19:34.240]  she's he's still on.
[19:34.240 --> 19:38.600]  I run into people at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go
[19:38.600 --> 19:41.920]  oh Alex I used to love you I wish you were still on air are you ever gonna go back on
[19:41.920 --> 19:45.560]  air and I'm like we're on hundreds of radio stations over 100 TV stations and cable stations
[19:45.560 --> 19:49.280]  we have our own streams info wars dot com and band on video they go really they said you
[19:49.280 --> 19:54.880]  were off the air because they took the platforming as off the air no we have our own platform
[19:54.880 --> 20:02.080]  info wars info wars info wars.
[20:02.080 --> 20:14.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:14.080 --> 20:29.920]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones.
[20:29.920 --> 20:38.520]  We're on this blue ball spinning through the galaxy and most people never even asked
[20:38.520 --> 20:47.040]  where we came from or who we are who's our daddy well I'm asking that question we're
[20:47.040 --> 20:57.400]  going to open the phones up take a ton of your calls today from Judy and Andre and
[20:57.400 --> 21:03.920]  Berto and Hobbs and Carlos and John and Tim and many many others so that's all coming
[21:03.920 --> 21:13.640]  up okay let's go ahead and burrow into the facts there's a new natural news dot com article
[21:13.640 --> 21:19.720]  up on info wars dot com breaking new analysis reveals president trust must lock down the
[21:19.720 --> 21:26.600]  USA just like Italy in order to break the chain of exponential spread of the coronavirus
[21:26.600 --> 21:32.960]  all air traffic and road traffic must be halted you know that is a very extreme statement by
[21:32.960 --> 21:39.560]  Mike Adams and he's an engineer he's a mathematician he's the smartest people I know but I've seen
[21:39.560 --> 21:47.760]  the other models the virus will still just spread slower but many models show it'll spread
[21:47.760 --> 21:54.720]  just as much and who knows it'll mutate to be worse or less looks like it's mutating
[21:54.720 --> 22:06.040]  to get worse so and we don't even know it's morbidity rate first it was 15 and now it's
[22:06.040 --> 22:10.560]  two maybe it's lower and again if it's one tenth of one percent it's a serious issue
[22:10.560 --> 22:15.440]  but they don't have a vaccine for it you don't want a vaccine for it it's a mutant virus
[22:15.440 --> 22:20.440]  you'll never have a proper vaccine just like the flu is always mutating it's why no vaccine
[22:20.440 --> 22:23.960]  for the flu has ever worked actually read the real literature on it the real white papers
[22:23.960 --> 22:35.880]  the real it's it's a fact think about that and in the old days is a few years ago everybody
[22:35.880 --> 22:42.320]  knew there were huge crises caused by vaccines and mass deaths and side effects and secret
[22:42.320 --> 22:56.160]  vaccine payout funds but now Facebook and Twitter and Google they say an apple you're
[22:56.160 --> 23:01.600]  not going to say a word about vaccines unless you're a doctor approved by big pharma wow
[23:01.600 --> 23:09.160]  so there goes the power of consumer reports and hey I went in this restaurant and I think
[23:09.160 --> 23:13.640]  I got food poisoning or hey my kid took this shot and had a convulsion he that's we've
[23:13.640 --> 23:19.440]  always known that's the most important reporting there is is the average person but they've
[23:19.440 --> 23:24.760]  shut it all down ladies and gentlemen and now we know that things like rotten tomatoes
[23:24.760 --> 23:31.160]  and trip advisor are rigged just five six years ago they were pretty accurate now they're
[23:31.160 --> 23:40.440]  rigged there's articles and reports of it everywhere and so the system set up the internet
[23:40.440 --> 23:45.280]  and sold it to us that oh it's the it's the it's the internet of things and we're all
[23:45.280 --> 23:49.160]  able to go and say what we like and whatever the is the best goes to the top that got us
[23:49.160 --> 23:54.840]  all addicted because it was so real it was so true they still game it some but now it's
[23:54.840 --> 24:00.680]  completely becoming synthetic where it's not just Alex Jones that the search results
[24:00.680 --> 24:09.520]  are fixed all negative all old news articles demonizing me and lies and incredible disinformation
[24:09.520 --> 24:20.840]  but now it gets even more insane where it's almost everything now oh you think Google
[24:20.840 --> 24:25.000]  just shows you where all the restaurants are maybe to show you all of them or the nav on
[24:25.000 --> 24:32.840]  your car but now it's who pays it's who pays Dodge it's who pays Toyota it's who pays Mercedes
[24:32.840 --> 24:38.160]  it's who pays Google it's who pays Twitter it's who pays Facebook just to be a map that
[24:38.160 --> 24:44.200]  you see now remember at first false advertising they would show you everything but now they
[24:44.200 --> 24:50.320]  don't show you everything but see you're already addicted to it I'm already addicted to it
[24:50.320 --> 24:55.040]  you think you're getting what's real you think you're getting what was the interface to the
[24:55.040 --> 25:00.200]  world a crystal ball but now it's not a crystal ball that looks wherever you want to look
[25:00.200 --> 25:04.520]  a Palantir is what they call the internet that's an old NSA term for 30 years ago they're
[25:04.520 --> 25:15.720]  building it not just a program they have and you think about that how they're robbing
[25:15.720 --> 25:21.760]  reality and blinding you but when it comes to a debate about it it's just oh we're just
[25:21.760 --> 25:29.160]  censoring Alex Jones that the Nazi and then even that's a lie so I'm going to take your
[25:29.160 --> 25:36.560]  calls I'm going to get into all of this but I don't think Mike's bad for giving the extreme
[25:36.560 --> 25:45.080]  analysis and he's been pretty much dead on so far but we have to look at the other perspectives
[25:45.080 --> 25:52.720]  and all of this and say there's really not proof of the morbidity of the lethalness of
[25:52.720 --> 25:56.840]  this at any level that would cause this type of panic but it's that it's an unknown and
[25:56.840 --> 26:01.800]  China responded by locking things down up front and all the leftist cities and all the leftist
[26:01.800 --> 26:07.120]  tech companies and all the big banks are ordering the biggest panic they could and they're canceling
[26:07.120 --> 26:12.520]  work it you know big tech buildings because they don't want you going out big tech wants
[26:12.520 --> 26:17.160]  you in your house hooked up to a terminal with drones outside surveilling you where you're
[26:17.160 --> 26:29.160]  not allowed to go outside unless they've authorized it they want you forced into their cage a mini
[26:29.160 --> 26:34.280]  Times Square where it's all just screens and controls and and Google goggles and brain
[26:34.280 --> 26:40.080]  ships and that's all children are born into and everybody's going to be cesarean section
[26:40.080 --> 26:43.680]  born and then you won't even be able to be born because everybody's sterilized and this
[26:43.680 --> 26:48.920]  is the admitted incremental plan they're following step by step and I can tell you just like
[26:48.920 --> 26:55.400]  the Bible told you 2000 years ago humans did not cook up this plan I mean anybody that
[26:55.400 --> 27:00.640]  really sits back I know Mike Adams agrees with me and many others I don't get into flying
[27:00.640 --> 27:05.200]  saucers and how the space station constantly see stuff shooting by at 50,000 miles an hour
[27:05.200 --> 27:14.680]  and going in loopy loops I mean obviously there's a bunch of stuff up there
[27:14.680 --> 27:21.200]  but if you look at the architecture of the rollout and the smartphones and the and the
[27:21.200 --> 27:29.600]  system of making the world uninhabitable for humans it's alien and again the Bible says
[27:29.600 --> 27:40.280]  there is a fallen entity that is immortal
[27:40.280 --> 27:48.720]  that lives here but can't get off it is imprisoned and hates us because we were made by the dude
[27:48.720 --> 27:53.960]  that marooned them here that's the coolest science fiction book ever man 2000 years ago
[27:53.960 --> 27:58.360]  3000 years ago for the Egyptians were saying that too you don't just think the Jews just
[27:58.360 --> 28:02.560]  cooked that up 3000 years ago we're putting in the Old Testament in the New Testament
[28:02.560 --> 28:06.560]  and then it's ever the Indians say that in their Sanskrit and it's in the carvings and
[28:06.560 --> 28:15.640]  and that's what it is folks some really nasty nasty aliens who really want to hurt you and
[28:15.640 --> 28:19.880]  they're getting humans that collaborate with them through a spiritual interface it's like
[28:19.880 --> 28:24.240]  the internet you don't see it but it's a spiritual interface spiritual spirit it's a transmission
[28:24.240 --> 28:28.760]  they've not proven that that's going on itself hummingbirds ought to fly from you know Canada
[28:28.760 --> 28:36.520]  and Guatemala and they're building a thing to kill everybody and telling those that sold
[28:36.520 --> 28:41.160]  out to them don't worry you'll merge the machines and join us soon yes they were so ever oh

[33:24.000 --> 33:32.320]  live here in this country arping on the wars we fight griping about the way things ought
[33:32.320 --> 33:33.320]  to be.
[33:33.320 --> 33:40.160]  I don't mind them and I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they believe
[33:40.160 --> 33:41.160]  in.
[33:41.160 --> 33:47.000]  I had Meryl Haggard tickets bought they're walking on the fighting side.
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.240]  Oh Siri says she didn't quite hear me asking about I had Meryl Haggard tickets bought a
[33:52.240 --> 34:00.000]  month before he died he was on a Texas Oklahoma tour he died of pneumonia and I had never
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.920]  seen Meryl Haggard in person.
[34:03.920 --> 34:06.640]  Same thing with Johnny Cash back before South by Southwest was one of the biggest things
[34:06.640 --> 34:11.920]  in the world this is like 30 years ago it's hard to believe I've been out of high school
[34:11.920 --> 34:18.800]  that long my parents I just got out of high school said we have tickets from our friends
[34:18.800 --> 34:27.760]  downtown there's some musicians involved to Johnny Cash and I'm like yeah I got a girlfriend
[34:27.760 --> 34:31.760]  I got stuff I like Johnny Cash because I listen to Johnny Cash all the time I'm a CD player
[34:31.760 --> 34:39.080]  in my car and then he died like a year later on the last shows he did they say it was incredible
[34:39.080 --> 34:43.000]  I don't know why I'm even telling that story it's like just if there's something you want
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.560]  to do on your bucket list you need to get it done is all I'm saying because especially
[34:47.560 --> 34:51.600]  when it comes to American icons like that because you know I don't give a rat's ass
[34:51.600 --> 34:57.280]  about some Hollywood globalist tiddlywanks person but outlaws like Meryl Haggard and
[34:57.280 --> 35:03.640]  Johnny Cash and Wayland Jennings and people like that that did their own thing and totally
[35:03.640 --> 35:09.320]  changed the entire industry and also promoted Americana that was a revolutionary thing but
[35:09.320 --> 35:16.600]  I got to tell you because it needs to be said there's nothing more rebel and more avant-garde
[35:16.600 --> 35:27.720]  and more grassroots and more Paul Revere and more outlaw more salt of the earth Americana
[35:27.720 --> 35:33.440]  than Info Wars it's just a fact our guest our crew what we do here the listeners the
[35:33.440 --> 35:39.200]  callers just everybody it's amazing and there's nothing more rebel than being lied about and
[35:39.200 --> 35:47.200]  demonized and attacked and sued in the platform by scum so I'm proudest of my children and
[35:47.200 --> 35:52.200]  I'm proud of just being alive and being conscious but I want to say I'm proud of what Info Wars
[35:52.200 --> 35:56.240]  has done and all the trials and tribulations we've gone through and I've just been letting
[35:56.240 --> 36:01.320]  myself instead of always being so angry that we're not fighting hard enough and that the
[36:01.320 --> 36:06.480]  enemy's so evil and that I'm so angry at myself with this weight that I'm not doing enough
[36:06.480 --> 36:09.880]  I've really been praying about it a lot and God said you need to enjoy the victories you've
[36:09.880 --> 36:15.760]  had and savor things and have more joy and you need to tell people about the great success
[36:15.760 --> 36:21.160]  we've all had together that's literally what God's put on my heart and so I just want to
[36:21.160 --> 36:26.560]  take a moment to recognize this crew and to recognize the incredible audience of activists
[36:26.560 --> 36:30.680]  that's an oxymoron to call you an audience you are hard chargers I love you whether you're
[36:30.680 --> 36:38.680]  old young black white ispanic asian from Japan Mexico South Korea Chile Canada Germany Russia
[36:38.680 --> 36:42.800]  I don't care we're all human beings and we all want justice and freedom that's why you're
[36:42.800 --> 36:49.240]  tuned in and it's just an amazing thing that we've all been through together it's absolutely
[36:49.240 --> 36:57.920]  an amazing thing we've all been through together I could plow into this coronavirus stack I
[36:57.920 --> 37:09.280]  could plow into the simple war stack and man there's a lot wow man the stuff that the pervert
[37:09.280 --> 37:14.480]  mafia is doing the pedophile mafia I mean that's what drag queen story time is is the
[37:14.480 --> 37:21.080]  pedophile mafia grooming children publicly and saying they're grooming them and I pray
[37:21.080 --> 37:25.600]  about this too like do I do I play the latest clips that are the most horrible ever or at
[37:25.600 --> 37:29.080]  a certain point we just talk about the fact that we love God and we love justice we need
[37:29.080 --> 37:34.440]  to protect our children and we know how bad they are now and we've kind of done the job
[37:34.440 --> 37:37.800]  exposing them and the truth is we have to keep exposing and we have to keep showing
[37:37.800 --> 37:43.760]  it because they want us to just get overwhelmed and just give up do not give up but there
[37:43.760 --> 37:48.480]  is a time to expose these people and to show what they're doing there's a time not to I
[37:48.480 --> 37:54.200]  just I mean I know you've got courage just like I do but man looking at these people
[37:54.200 --> 37:57.600]  and watching them hump these kids in public man I just can't do it I'm gonna have a heart
[37:57.600 --> 38:05.040]  attack and is that a form of censorship are they winning because I can't look at fat
[38:05.040 --> 38:11.320]  dudes and clown outfit saying we're here to groom your kids one way or the other you know
[38:11.320 --> 38:17.240]  it is my mind is like hey you just you know what your soul says we should do then that
[38:17.240 --> 38:21.040]  makes them the victims and they win they're trying to get us to strike out at them instead
[38:21.040 --> 38:27.200]  we've got to guard our children expose these monsters and cut the funding off to any group
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.640]  oh my god or any turn it off turn it off I already saw this that's another thing I do
[38:31.640 --> 38:35.560]  research for the show and then I just can't show it again it is like there's some kind
[38:35.560 --> 38:42.400]  of crime it like we already saw it once and you just you just but the people need to know
[38:42.400 --> 38:47.920]  though see I showed you the footage we've got stations will call and say you shouldn't
[38:47.920 --> 38:54.000]  be showing that and I'll say you're absolutely right sir ma'am but this is what kids are
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.240]  being taught people need to know they go actually you're right I well what do we do I don't
[38:58.240 --> 39:05.040]  know we do I don't know I I don't know I don't know because I can't even show you what comes
[39:05.040 --> 39:09.720]  next on these videos I don't want to look at it showing it is something should not be
[39:09.720 --> 39:14.840]  shown we're a lot of TV stations I get it man and the stations are like you can't show
[39:14.840 --> 39:22.160]  that exactly how is it happening to small children if you can't show it on TV
[39:22.160 --> 39:36.040]  oh boy oh do you have any crickets anyways see I'm gonna take a vacation next week I'm
[39:36.040 --> 39:43.080]  not going out of town but everyone's insisted that I take a week off and somehow how do you
[39:43.080 --> 39:58.600]  take a week off during this coronavirus insanity the coronavirus is a hoax and the coronavirus
[39:58.600 --> 40:04.240]  is a hundred percent real that's how the universe works it's paradoxes it's man made it does
[40:04.240 --> 40:08.720]  kill a certain percentage of people but the hype and the economic crises and the supply
[40:08.720 --> 40:13.000]  chain disruptions are already happened and it's seismic and it's devastating and it's
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.760]  meant to take out the US economy we predicted that and the whole globalist media is openly
[40:16.760 --> 40:23.360]  flaunting that as a way to bring down the US and Trump needs to be out attacking them
[40:23.360 --> 40:30.080]  for using it as a weapon Tucker Carlson gets it you know who we need for president I'm
[40:30.080 --> 40:37.000]  serious step aside Donald Trump and give me Tucker Carlson I'm serious because I'm thinking
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.080]  this stuff and I'm saying and I watched Tucker a couple days later and I'm not saying he's
[40:41.080 --> 40:45.080]  copying us though he is a viewer but he there by to him and he's got knowledge I've got
[40:45.080 --> 40:50.080]  knowledge we distill it and he knows how to distill it take all the stuff everybody
[40:50.080 --> 41:02.920]  all sees and just say it in like four minutes what a gift because you kill the hysteria
[41:02.920 --> 41:07.960]  by admitting the worst potential up front so now people know what to expect if you don't
[41:07.960 --> 41:13.360]  do that then when it comes you're hit flat footed we're gonna go to break them right
[41:13.360 --> 41:18.520]  back with your calls I promise eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine

[47:54.720 --> 48:00.840]  sport and there are no spectators you're in the arena whether you like it or not you were
[48:00.840 --> 48:05.920]  born into the arena and those that decide to get in a fetal position and be victims
[48:05.920 --> 48:12.000]  are the ones that are going to get run over those that decide to start fighting are the
[48:12.000 --> 48:19.680]  ones that are going to soar all right let's go to Roberto in New York disagreed with AJ
[48:19.680 --> 48:24.920]  on Trump and the virus goes to the head of the line Roberto tell me how I'm wrong hey
[48:24.920 --> 48:28.760]  Mr. Jones well first I'd like to say it was an honor to stand side by side with you in
[48:28.760 --> 48:33.600]  Virginia I was on your show the night before in front of the Capitol building and then
[48:33.600 --> 48:39.600]  also if I could I've had storable food of yours for about five years and I sleep better
[48:39.600 --> 48:45.200]  at night knowing that my family will be well off in a any type of situation like we have
[48:45.200 --> 48:52.040]  now so with that being said I feel as if you've been passive to say the least on your criticism
[48:52.040 --> 48:59.200]  of Trump for those of us that are very educated on what's going on with our financial system
[48:59.200 --> 49:04.000]  and the true numbers of the economy and jobs and everything yeah something he inherited
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.920]  I mean the globalists are trying to bring down the economy of course the economy is
[49:06.920 --> 49:11.040]  faking all screwed over and out of control he's trying to ride the tiger he was put on
[49:11.040 --> 49:21.640]  top of Trump the tiger brother why I do I just feel lied to by Trump frequently and
[49:21.640 --> 49:26.840]  I mean you can definitely prove that the things that he says to the public are lies and are
[49:26.840 --> 49:35.640]  his voter base is a lot of middle-class hard-working people okay well well go ahead CNN will show
[49:35.640 --> 49:42.200]  you 50 jars of gumballs and say every one of those is a lie that's a stunt tell me what
[49:42.200 --> 49:47.160]  is a lie about the U.S. economy that Trump's telling you well I'd like to start with the
[49:47.160 --> 49:53.720]  jobs numbers and the labor force participation rate yet right right now we're at I believe
[49:53.720 --> 49:59.920]  63% labor force participation rate the actual people that work in 2010 at the height of the
[49:59.920 --> 50:05.760]  financial crisis we had 64% of our population employed and working so that number right
[50:05.760 --> 50:10.840]  there it swept under the rug when they just want to report new jobs now I'm not against
[50:10.840 --> 50:17.320]  Trump he has done many many things for our for our country and you know his support base
[50:17.320 --> 50:23.640]  but there's sure to make his tomatoes tomatoes you know we're in the economic war with the
[50:23.640 --> 50:26.920]  globalists trying to bring the economy down of course he's hyping everything positive
[50:26.920 --> 50:31.520]  to keep the country going if he does it the ship goes down of course he's rallying the
[50:31.520 --> 50:39.800]  trips and notice just that rallying took us from a 1% growth rate to a 3.8 so the Federal
[50:39.800 --> 50:45.960]  Reserve raised rates to kill that I just I've seen Trump man really deliver on pulling out
[50:45.960 --> 50:53.720]  of Afghanistan pulling out of Syria I mean I here's the deal I run a few things nothing
[50:53.720 --> 50:58.600]  like the president let's say one one hundredth and I know how hard it is even good people
[50:58.600 --> 51:03.600]  to get it done I cannot imagine what it's like to have to sit there with traders and
[51:03.600 --> 51:10.160]  spies and lies and saboteurs and what he's gotten done we should just be I'm sorry I
[51:10.160 --> 51:16.240]  just look I'm sorry it's not about sycophantically praising Trump I just I can't sit there and
[51:16.240 --> 51:21.600]  look at a man who's 73 works harder than I can and I'm literally burnout okay you want
[51:21.600 --> 51:26.040]  to say it but you know I probably had a couple nervous breakdowns okay already I don't know
[51:26.040 --> 51:31.240]  how he's doing this okay so I just I just it's too easy look at the man in the arena
[51:31.240 --> 51:36.000]  bloody for us and the whole enemy against him and then just say and I'll bitch chatting
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.240]  about things he needs to do I just when it comes to boosting the economy he's done exactly
[51:41.240 --> 51:47.200]  what I would do sir but the the people that are benefiting the most the middle class feels
[51:47.200 --> 51:53.800]  fantastic refreshing their 401k 50 times today however the middle class is also in that herd
[51:53.800 --> 51:59.040]  mentality and the vast majority of these people will absolutely lose all of the money that
[51:59.040 --> 52:04.280]  they poured into this stock market because of of Trump's touting of these numbers that
[52:04.280 --> 52:08.880]  are and the globalist think if they take that 401k away all those people are gonna turn
[52:08.880 --> 52:14.760]  against Trump and they're wrong I appreciate your call Trump took the fiat wrecked thing
[52:14.760 --> 52:19.840]  he had and he put a new coat of paid on it and he cleaned up a few things and put in
[52:19.840 --> 52:25.280]  a new battery and he's just hoping it gets down the road so he can get innovations released
[52:25.280 --> 52:33.200]  he inherited a a a burning Hulk and then he stood up to China and their screw jobs and
[52:33.200 --> 52:37.920]  said no and shut a bunch of it down and brought it back to us because all one sided and did
[52:37.920 --> 52:43.400]  a fair deal a fair deal not reparations for 50 years of China having a one side deal screwing
[52:43.400 --> 52:47.600]  us over how about reparations I mean it's just it I mean we deserve that China with
[52:47.600 --> 52:51.720]  the globalist that run it have had a one sided deals deindustrializing screwing everybody
[52:51.720 --> 52:56.600]  over the whole world and Trump just came in and destroyed all of that he lets India go
[52:56.600 --> 53:02.800]  after the Islamics that are killing the Hindus are beautiful I mean you know listen when
[53:02.800 --> 53:07.160]  I actually get pissed at Trump and it happens all the time because I get tunnel vision like
[53:07.160 --> 53:11.000]  you do and I want to see him do the right thing on this or that and then I sit back
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.960]  and I start looking at what he really did and it's just like my god how do you that
[53:16.960 --> 53:20.360]  how do you do this how do you carry that out and I don't want to make this about Trump
[53:20.360 --> 53:23.640]  in fact this is what I'm going to say for two years but it would take a whole show to
[53:23.640 --> 53:28.980]  say it I don't want my identity to be Donald Trump I don't want your identity to be Donald
[53:28.980 --> 53:36.000]  Trump Liberty and freedom cannot be all state on this dude or me they think the Liberty
[53:36.000 --> 53:41.240]  movement is staked on Alex Jones they they know this audience this this operation on
[53:41.240 --> 53:47.880]  the focal point is relaunched libertile worldwide so they want to demonize me shut me down attack
[53:47.880 --> 53:53.120]  me make me give up so they can then say oh look we destroyed their champion as long as
[53:53.120 --> 53:58.840]  you realize that my destruction is our empowerment and I'm not I'm not asking for it but I mean
[53:58.840 --> 54:05.200]  if it needs to happen so be it it's just that that is not an enemy victory the attack on
[54:05.200 --> 54:11.240]  this operation is a sign of our prowess and our devastating success with truth against
[54:11.240 --> 54:16.120]  their operations so again the critic can look at the man in the arena all day long and say
[54:16.120 --> 54:24.880]  how he should have better you know a man by his enemies and Trump has the enemies of
[54:24.880 --> 54:29.120]  somebody that should be supported and that's where I stand and that's what I have to say
[54:29.120 --> 54:33.200]  about that whole situation but I think it's fine for you to call in and criticize the
[54:33.200 --> 54:42.000]  president of course the numbers are cooked that's baked into the cake he's riding the
[54:42.000 --> 54:51.920]  horse or the tiger or the bear or the bull that he was given and you really can't fault
[54:51.920 --> 54:59.760]  a man doing that fighting with what he's got all right let's go to and Andrew is that Andrew
[54:59.760 --> 55:08.760]  Andrew my eyes are going out and Ray and New Yorker on here go ahead Alex you've got it
[55:08.760 --> 55:16.240]  wrong again I called that I called once and you said Andre it's Andrea okay I just can't
[55:16.240 --> 55:20.600]  read the thing my eyes are going out that's okay so listen you know it's so funny because
[55:20.600 --> 55:25.680]  I'm calling from New York and I totally disagree with your first caller but the reason why I'm
[55:25.680 --> 55:30.520]  calling is is because I'm frustrated like you I've been doing business with China for
[55:30.520 --> 55:37.120]  20 years and I specifically have been doing business with this one gentleman that came
[55:37.120 --> 55:43.480]  from China and him and I got close because we were both young and we were both starting
[55:43.480 --> 55:48.560]  out a new business and I became friends with him and I went back to work with him a few
[55:48.560 --> 55:56.600]  years ago and in our showroom we're in the apparel industry in 2016 he was all for Trump
[55:56.600 --> 56:06.160]  he told me China hated Obama okay couldn't stand Obama wanted Trump to win and I just
[56:06.160 --> 56:13.240]  find it very interesting that the left is you know blaming him for with the tariffs and
[56:13.240 --> 56:19.280]  with everything else because he knew what he was walking into he has that experience
[56:19.280 --> 56:24.720]  he knows what's going on when he says he's a president she is a friend of his they have
[56:24.720 --> 56:31.440]  a culture they're saving the state when this happened after the tariffs I knew right away
[56:31.440 --> 56:36.960]  and he also told me one thing that nobody's mentioning every hundred years something goes
[56:36.960 --> 56:46.520]  on in China and my boss at the time in 2016 told me in 2020 something is going to happen
[56:46.520 --> 56:52.240]  according to the Chinese belief so whether it was done purposely not done purposely
[56:52.240 --> 56:58.720]  I believe I follow you I think I was totally everybody trashing Trump because Trump didn't
[56:58.720 --> 57:05.440]  need to do this okay he did it he was called to do it he's doing a great job and I like
[57:05.440 --> 57:09.440]  to see everybody else go up there and do what he's doing and that's what I want and
[57:09.440 --> 57:14.480]  I think you're doing a fantastic job too well I'm sorry that I got your name wrong repeatedly
[57:14.480 --> 57:19.360]  I used to have 2015 vision and it was 2020 they're gonna have to move that screen closer
[57:19.360 --> 57:24.040]  my eyes are going out of 46 man it's like stuff starts breaking I said teeth I can bite
[57:24.040 --> 57:27.480]  through anything now they're like breaking off and getting old it's okay get ready to
[57:27.480 --> 57:33.320]  join the Lord about 50 years and right when this body rocks and falls apart that spirits

[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:40.160]  heard it was coming from the hangar three hours ago I told you though he really loves
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:46.400]  he doesn't he doesn't attack the animals the benevolent dictator of the world I would
[1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:55.840]  legalize be shallity where you are giving you where you are pleasuring the animal I
[1:02:55.840 --> 1:03:03.920]  guess what I'm saying I'm saying that guy's got some creepy lips man talks about a dictator
[1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:11.480]  that wants to have worldwide legalized be shallity to pleasure animals and see it's
[1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:18.480]  almost evil even cover what he's doing like I never thought about pleasuring animals and
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:22.960]  then like there's this big fat gross to the defense Nazi collaborators and says I'm the
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:28.120]  worst person in the world but that he's doing all this okay we've got huge coronavirus news
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:31.440]  Mike Adams pops out of the bottom of the hour I'm gonna come right back and I'm gonna go
[1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:35.520]  to your phone calls as quickly as possible these are all great callers but Judy and Austin
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:41.440]  and Robert and Hobbes and Carlos and Bob and John and Tim and Chase that tastes always
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:46.080]  calls in it's not first time callers that's fine everybody can call in today agree disagree
[1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:50.320]  and we can cover whatever topics you want so that's all coming up and then I guess I'll
[1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:54.560]  just do this at the start of the next segment I'll talk about some personal things that
[1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:59.080]  have gone on with me that are that are interesting and that and that you should know about here
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:05.360]  first before the spin doctors have had their chance to have fun with it and I don't want
[1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:09.520]  to tell them but there's no such thing as bad press and just because they put out fake
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:12.440]  stuff doesn't hurt us because people know they're a bunch of liars because I'm not
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:17.280]  going to tell people the exact truth when I come back so get ready for that on the other
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:22.880]  side don't tell everybody we're talking about it all right tell them how the corporate media
[1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:26.800]  will just ignore whatever I say on a topic you know it's about me and just say they're
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:31.520]  live but you hear it and then you promulgate it and without you I am so dead in the water
[1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:36.800]  but that's okay because the Alamo went down in flames as well and I'm not looking forward
[1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:45.000]  to that but I'm not afraid of it and I kind of have a look at Florida why not enjoy we'll
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:58.120]  be right back stay with us info wars dot com the destiny of humanity six weeks ago we warned
[1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:03.320]  you that the choreographed nature of the global media and governments concerning coronavirus
[1:05:03.320 --> 1:05:09.280]  told us he was a major globalist operation now whether it's super deadly or not the issue

[1:06:28.280 --> 1:06:33.160]  at the bottom of the hour with huge news is he right in saying this but the model show
[1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:39.960]  in Europe with what Israel and Italy are doing breaking new analysis reveals President Trump
[1:06:39.960 --> 1:06:45.240]  must lock down the USA just like Italy in order to break the chain of exponential spread
[1:06:45.240 --> 1:06:51.160]  of coronavirus all air traffic and road traffic must be halted I'm not saying that that's what
[1:06:51.160 --> 1:06:56.440]  the math shows according to Mike has been dead on so far and boy I sure hope he's wrong

[1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:13.720]  to your calls here in a moment now that said I want to not just get ahead of something
[1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:20.000]  but I actually enjoy talking about this because it was quite the experience to see what's
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:26.480]  going on in this country and and to go through it myself now I talked about this on air quite
[1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:30.520]  a bit that I've been a heavy drinker at times not drunk at times probably went more than
[1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:35.160]  four months just last year not drinking at all and I've certainly gotten to the point
[1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:39.080]  where I don't have more than a beer or a glass of wine and drive a car because then I know
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:47.720]  that I will never blow above 0.8 and I've had police pull me over and I'm totally honest
[1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:52.920]  yeah I had two beers about two hours ago at a Mexican food restaurant or whatever and
[1:07:52.920 --> 1:08:01.320]  they'll talk to me that's it well last night I've been out at a Japanese restaurant my
[1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:07.360]  wife and that this little bitty tiny bottle of sake I mean just it's a little bit of shot
[1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:11.400]  glasses of it but it's just a tiny little little bottle of sake maybe sixteen percent
[1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:17.640]  alcohol she didn't drink a lot of it we didn't even finish it I drank probably half of it
[1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:26.400]  we go home later need something from the store I drive out lights turn on pulls me over says
[1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:30.640]  oh you match the description of a black car we heard some domestic dispute here and okay
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:34.240]  well that was a speed news yeah five miles of the speed limit needs you to get out of
[1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:39.520]  the car so I get out of the car and he says you've been drinking and I said yeah about
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:44.240]  two hours ago I went and ate at a Japanese restaurant and had a small bottle of sake
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:52.080]  with my wife he says all right then he starts having me do these what do you call them yes
[1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:56.120]  a variety check where you stand on one foot and look at the other 10 seconds he shows
[1:08:56.120 --> 1:09:00.680]  me what to do he can't do it and and goes oh well that's my weight that's my belt did
[1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:06.760]  that so I start laughing then I knew I wasn't being mean I was like so I did it but I was
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:13.840]  wobbling at 10 seconds and he goes well that's it you're you're going to jail and I said
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:21.120]  man I just told you I had hours ago alcohol probably not even in my body he said well
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:24.040]  you've you know when you failed this this part is we're gonna breathalyze me goes no
[1:09:24.040 --> 1:09:28.520]  they do that at the jail so we got there in like 20 minutes they go in and they had me
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:33.760]  blowing they go keep blowing so I leave and they put me in the tank a next guy comes through
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:38.240]  he goes I heard Alex Jones here he goes there he is Alex Jones they're all in there saying
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:41.920]  that you literally don't have any alcohol in your blood at any level they can barely
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:46.040]  even pick up and you shouldn't be here this is crazy why are you here and it wasn't till
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:50.440]  I got out this morning that I actually got the paperwork and that's what's really weird
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:54.320]  is that there were two guys in there getting tested hearing that basically alcohol didn't
[1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:57.560]  even show up and I'm not saying a conspiracy here it's not saying the police are out to
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:06.000]  get me at that with the level level but still the level they had was below the law and legal
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:13.360]  so there you go but when you see this hit the news and I'm welcome the policy look bring
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:19.640]  it bring it it'll be Jones arrested for DWI and then whatever Sandy Hook and the attack
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:23.000]  you know that you know they're gonna put that in there Sandy Hook and I are arrested and
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.280]  they're like well you got arrested for Sandy Hook I mean that's what they always say and
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:31.200]  it'll just be some wild ass stuff and I wanted you to hear it up front because I was being
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:36.400]  told this by folks that came out of there going yeah they were talking about Alex Jones
[1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:40.800]  is here and he didn't the first test showed no alcohol and they couldn't believe it and
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:46.840]  wait it's him so they kept having me blow and blow and blow and blow and I was like
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:51.320]  and I mean because I'm a big guy man a little bitty bottle of wine at least two hours before
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:59.560]  and I'd been at home in the hot tub drink it I mean I did not have zero buzz just zero
[1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:04.560]  and I'm like dude you can't stand on one leg like you just wanted me to I did it better
[1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:08.800]  than you did and he had this light in my eyes also the crap and then he'd sit there with
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:14.240]  a light over the side like just for a minute and I finally get tired we go oh involuntary
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:22.160]  you're I'm like no dude I'm not gonna stare for one minute at your light pin so he wanted
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:25.920]  and he got me but then I learned from the jail guards they go no Travis County had the
[1:11:25.920 --> 1:11:32.320]  lowest level of arrest in the country or in it was a country it used to be the Lonestar
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:36.840]  State in Texas and so they had all this heat palm I pull up the articles is true and so
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:41.360]  now it's not that deputy that did this it's just they pull you over and you're truthful
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:47.640]  and go yeah I had two beers couple hours ago you're arrested doesn't matter it's legal
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:52.720]  so all these restaurants and all these bars in in Texas and all over the country you can't
[1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:59.520]  they'll sell you beer they'll sell you wine they'll sell you liquor you can't drink one
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:03.880]  drink and I've been reading about Moses against Trump driving you can't do this anywhere in
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:10.360]  the country now one drink they don't care if you're below the amount now he gets beaten
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:20.640]  in court but they it's insane folks they're now arresting people and taking them to jail
[1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:26.120]  and they're continuing prosecutions that show zero alcohol I've got news articles on that
[1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:32.920]  show this will just be a huge another thing but you know what I didn't even want alcohol
[1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:36.560]  when I started back on New Year's drinking some more and so I'm gonna have that power
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:42.680]  over them that I'm in a hundred percent quit so that they can never again but manage it's
[1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:47.200]  weird you go to a restaurant you they're like hey want one wine one beer and you can't have
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:54.920]  one the bottle of sake was this tall between two people and I'll let me just show you the
[1:12:54.920 --> 1:13:00.360]  hell we're the show me show here in like Missouri let me show you right here Dr. McCamp shop
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:05.440]  please here you go ladies and gentlemen here is my alcohol test right here two of them
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:15.440]  they put on there zero point zero seven six it's zero point zero eight one and so they
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:20.320]  even lowered it that's like one beer basically and then zero point zero seven and they kept
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:25.080]  testing testing testing but that's the best ones they can get right there so Alex Jones
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:31.480]  there's your takeaway innocent Alex Jones arrested for DWI and was below the legal limit
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:38.000]  but when they put it out the news it will be the exact opposite giant fiasco that I was
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:43.080]  you know murdering children and running around with sickles chopping people's heads off and
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:48.800]  burning down houses with canisters of gasoline and snorting 14 lines of you know 14 foot
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:53.960]  lines of cocaine and shoving bottle rockets up my rear end I mean by the time they're
[1:13:53.960 --> 1:14:01.480]  done it's just gonna be arrested he's arrested he's arrested but for me what was crazy is
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:06.520]  the cop goes under demonstration he goes and then you just for 10 seconds you do this
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:11.640]  and he could he goes oh sorry my belt was a student it's hard to sit there and step
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:16.640]  on one foot with the other foot an inch off the ground and look at your foot you try it
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:21.720]  I was doing it this morning and I was having trouble I did it better at 10 o'clock at night
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:29.320]  going to get ice cream so I can't wait even if they try to continue because when you're
[1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:32.640]  under the log it's thrown out but it even try to continue claiming some sobriety deal
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:37.240]  that's great because I'll just have the cop on the squad car video unable to do it for
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:42.960]  three seconds how the he's the guy's in good shape by the way I'm like dude you can't do
[1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:47.840]  later in the car like you can't do oh my belt was oh give me a break dude I did dead lifts
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:54.520]  yesterday it was 10 o'clock at night I've been in a hot tub I've been doing other things
[1:14:54.520 --> 1:15:00.720]  to you know the old lady I mean I was relaxed I was tired I went out to get bluebell ice
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:05.160]  cream and you know this stuff's going on but it listen it's okay I don't blame that guy
[1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:09.880]  because that's mothers against drunk driving you know used to the alcohol and it was like
[1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:14.680]  three times for this now but now ladies and gentlemen I want drunk drivers arrested I
[1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:19.640]  don't want illegal aliens plowing folks over arrested but citizens here's the thing restaurants
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:25.760]  should not be allowed to sell alcohol if these laws continue you shouldn't be able to serve
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:32.440]  somebody a beer if they drink that 16 ounce beer and walk out they're gonna go to jail
[1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:38.120]  so I called for all restaurants and bars to be shut down seriously because you can't go
[1:15:38.120 --> 1:15:43.520]  in one and have two beers and then not go to jail so hey I'm ready for the mainstream

[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:10.400]  it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food and I had long discussions this
[1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:13.520]  morning over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels
[1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:17.560]  of this right now the folks run the plants to get the best idea we have but they want

[1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:51.760]  is that's open for discussion but you can hypothetically all day talk about just shut
[1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:56.600]  everything now don't even have humans alive you won't have any coronavirus problem alright
[1:20:56.600 --> 1:21:01.160]  who's been holding the longest is it Judy is it Austin is it Robert is it Hobbes is
[1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:09.080]  it Carlos who has been holding the longest let's talk to Joe in New Jersey and then
[1:21:09.080 --> 1:21:17.800]  Carlos Joe thanks for calling hey Alex hey brother go ahead hey I just want to say you
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:23.200]  know the supply chains are collapsing coming into China and we're relying on so much as
[1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:30.120]  Tucker Carlson had said I think there needs to be a real patriot infrastructure side of
[1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:36.320]  what Trump's trying to do to bring small businesses together and they can find each other in
[1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:40.440]  a very easy way kind of like like you know if I'm looking for the greatest supplements
[1:21:40.440 --> 1:21:44.640]  I'm going to info or store.com and find the supplements I need but if I'm looking for
[1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:50.760]  somebody to maybe manufacture something send me personal meat and pigs or cows there's
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:56.720]  nothing like that and to set that infrastructure up we need a big platform and it can be done
[1:21:56.720 --> 1:22:06.880]  very simply but you know there needs to be a platform to move that out well we do need
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:10.680]  to have more small companies more infrastructure and globalism has been designed to shut that
[1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:15.080]  down big tech works around the clock to buy up small companies but also suppress them
[1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:19.720]  and censor them that's a really good point Joe I appreciate your call Carlos in Canada
[1:22:19.720 --> 1:22:25.880]  you're on the air thanks for calling thank you Alex basically two points one I'd like
[1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:31.680]  to make at the end with regard to President Trump very brief the first is when I heard
[1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:37.120]  about the coronavirus the first thing I realized is that it was a virus and we should not be
[1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:42.120]  afraid of viruses in general they're always with us they're part of our microbiome if
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:47.840]  you want to call that a viral and it's part of our our very existence we couldn't exist
[1:22:47.840 --> 1:22:55.600]  without viruses now having said that the novel coroner coronavirus COV-19 when imaged it
[1:22:55.600 --> 1:23:02.280]  features with SARS and mirrors so yes I do agree that this is conceivably an artificially
[1:23:02.280 --> 1:23:10.080]  made possibly unlikely made virus but it is still a coronavirus and I would like to concentrate
[1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:17.080]  if possible Alex on how as a human being we can deal with coronavirus the first thing
[1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:22.840]  we should know is that the temperature of the nasal passages are lower when you're elderly
[1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:29.680]  when you're weakened by like a vitamin D when you are in a position of just being chilled
[1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:34.920]  so elderly people and people taking care of those who they love elderly and weak should
[1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:42.720]  have their feet very very warm at all times get wool get cotton socks wear at night and
[1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:49.200]  take a daily shower and gargle once a day that will give you a few hours of potential
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:58.280]  protection against the contact with the coronavirus the coronavirus is extremely tiny it is carried
[1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:04.840]  by smoke particles so you have to understand that when if this thing is artificially created
[1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:09.800]  they needed a place to release it where the population was very dense China is a very
[1:24:09.800 --> 1:24:18.000]  good place to do it Gaza in Israel is another very good place to test these sort of viral
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:22.800]  transmissions and so I would suggest that if you have elderly people and you want to protect
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:29.800]  them remember that they have to be given a means of boosting their immune system and
[1:24:29.800 --> 1:24:36.160]  also to be kept clean and to be warm especially in the lower areas because the hypothalamus
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:40.360]  is right behind the nose about an inch above the roof of your mouth and that controls your
[1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:47.600]  body temperature the the the running nose reaction and fevers are the body's reaction
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:53.720]  to a virus that is trying to spread it usually begins from the nasal passages onwards so
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:58.520]  that's what I have to say Alex and it's also good I know companies are coming out with
[1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:05.480]  iodine that is put into the nasal passage mixed and diluted and also things like nano
[1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:10.720]  silver and obviously I'm going to be a medical doctor and give advice I know that's some
[1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:14.280]  of your background your smart guy Carl is your longtime caller but but let me ask you
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:22.200]  this question what do you think the real thrust of it is clearly all the leftist groups Hollywood
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:27.960]  big tech Austin Texas Italy now run by globalist are all hyping it like it's the end of the
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:33.520]  world and saying it's Trump's fault that's is that just political hijacking or was this
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:38.520]  launched in plan to do this from beginning to tell you the truth it's more sinister
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:44.200]  than that you know I do analysis and what we have is a group of people that have been
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:49.040]  around president from to be around other presidents as well but these people want war they want
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:54.000]  world war three and they are in fact this coronavirus is a very good preparation for
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:59.800]  people to get used to body bags to seeing you know coffins everywhere to exactly puts
[1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:05.160]  this into a war footing a crisis mode at a war what I think it is is that some people
[1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:12.920]  wanted world war three to have already started to have the blockage of the of the oil transit
[1:26:12.920 --> 1:26:19.600]  through the canals so that they would in Iran so that they would have been at the streets
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:26.560]  of our moves by the way so that they would be able to generate a shortage of petrol fuel
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:34.360]  etc and why is it hitting Iran so hard even harder than south koreans or chinese work
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:38.760]  where it showed up that who knows what's being released in the name of coronavirus it's very
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:44.600]  sad Alex because if you look at in history that if you transpose the the countries that
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:50.360]  were involved in world war two and you just move it over it's almost the attitude is the
[1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:56.480]  same but if you look at the same players look at it Germany now is Russia the enemy
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:27:03.080]  Russia is now China on the other side you know and Iran would be likely or some you
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:08.480]  know other country that was involving world war two and basically these people I believe
[1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:13.600]  you can name names if you want but these people essentially want to provoke world war and
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:18.840]  they want to provoke it for the intentions that they know best is that is control of
[1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:24.680]  of a world population because the globalists believe they have a right to rule thank you
[1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:28.360]  Carlos Greco all right let's jam in one more before we go to break let's go to Austin
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:34.160]  Louisiana Austin Louisiana go ahead Alex I've been listening to you since 2008 freshman
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:38.440]  at college it's a pleasure to speak with you sir thank you sir so I you know we've been
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:44.120]  talking about the various agendas of things that you know about the coronavirus like
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:50.440]  the other day when you were talking about Trump and looking initially I guess the angle
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:55.800]  of him being poisoned and you know I think about the the only possible way that the
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:59.760]  new world order that the elites can take out Trump can assassinate him without him being
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:07.200]  a martyr and I and it's this it's the coronavirus you know it's oh yeah oh it hit CPAC oh it
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:12.480]  hit Trump they're all dead have bingo bingo right there and then he's in these additionally
[1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:17.680]  he's the figure had to to initiate every single protocol and that's the agenda that they need
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:20.520]  to roll through you know it's funny you say that because I'm not trying to put Trump down
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:26.120]  but he's looked really bad the last two weeks exactly he looks deflated he looks sick he
[1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:33.400]  looks haggard you're exactly right yeah and you know another piece real quick yeah I spent
[1:28:33.400 --> 1:28:37.680]  a lot of time hold on Austin don't hang up on a friendship with you the Mike Adams is

[1:32:57.080 --> 1:33:01.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:16.080]  Live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:34.080]  I'm just an average man with an average life. I work from 9 to 5. Hell I pay the price. All I want is to be left alone in my average home. But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight soon.
[1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:43.080]  I always feel like somebody's watching me and I love the price. I always feel like.
[1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:53.080]  But the very nature of the Internet is now everything you do is watch the Internet together and the Communist Chinese are now the saviors all over the world.
[1:33:54.080 --> 1:34:04.080]  They're going to teach us how to surveil people and give everybody safe. Your calls are coming up next segment Mike Adams natural news.com is popping in. I'm Alex Jones your host.
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:13.080]  Mike you've got a really scary article up at naturalnews.com it's also post info wars.com breaking.
[1:34:14.080 --> 1:34:31.080]  New analysis reveals President Trump must lock down the USA just like Italy in order to break the chain of exponential spread of the coronavirus all air traffic and road traffic must be halted but Mike well that's true or not let's get into that.
[1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:39.080]  The borders have been wide open forever. The mubonic plague and drug resistance TV is coming in and in Ebola potentially we're not supposed to worry about that.
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:51.080]  I'm not saying the virus isn't dangerous. I get the globalist created a huge hype around it. Clearly you were right and I was right. Those were right that it was going to be a big move against the US economy and weaponized against Trump and that he didn't understand that.
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:56.080]  That's all been proven right. So I hope you're wrong about this latest analysis. Tell us about it.
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:10.080]  Well you're exactly right. We have to block the borders to in fact in that article if you if you continue it says we have to block all international air traffic coming in and we have to block all cross border traffic especially with Mexico.
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:22.080]  Now look here's where this comes from the good news. You know how people keep saying well why can't you talk about good news. So we created a publicly downloadable spreadsheet to run pandemic projection scenarios.
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:31.080]  And that's up on on natural news. It's in an article. You can download the spreadsheet. You can change the numbers and you can run your own scenarios. We've had over 5,000 people just download that.
[1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:42.080]  It's free. It's an open source spreadsheet. Now if you run all the various scenarios different are not values different what's called social distancing suppression factors different mortality rates and so on.
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:57.080]  If you run all those scenarios Alex the only thing that actually works to stop the exponential spread is extreme lockdown. In fact and I'm not saying that I advocate this because of the liberty the civil liberties issues.
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:05.080]  I don't want to be locked down. I don't want to have medical martial law but guess what it's already begun. Governor Cuomo just announced the National Guard is deployed.
[1:36:05.080 --> 1:36:15.080]  Now medical martial law has begun in New York as of about an hour ago. That has just happened. There's an article up on zero hedge right now about that.
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:27.080]  So it has begun. The point is Italy will break the cycle of this. So Italy locked down the entire country in three to four weeks. Italy's new infections will plummet to close to zero.
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:36.080]  Now remember how we said in the United States we will have by July 4th if we don't change course we'll have 2.1 million deaths in America.
[1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:45.080]  I calculated and you can do it yourself in the spreadsheet if we have a 25% suppression of social spreading then that number drops to 1.1 million.
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:55.080]  But Alex if we have a 50% reduction with an R value and R not value of 2.4 then the number of deaths drops to just 1,300.
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:37:07.080]  We can get the deaths down from millions to just a few thousand but it requires massive lockdowns, quarantines, locking down cities, locking down the entire country, stopping all air traffic, stopping all road traffic.
[1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:09.080]  I'm not saying that I want that to happen.
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:19.080]  Sure Mike, that's what these models show but using and I'm not, it's the numbers we've got, using what numbers of death rate, how do we quantify those numbers in their province?
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:29.080]  That's a 2% mortality rate and you can change that number yourself in the spreadsheet so you can play around with half a percent or 1% or whatever number you want.
[1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:37.080]  But the point is the actual mortality rate isn't that big of a factor compared to the social distancing suppression rate.
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:50.080]  Now if the virus has an R not value of 6.0, which some scientists believe it does, then according to this model you have to have an 83%, that's 83%,
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:56.080]  83% stopping of new infections in order to keep this from going exponential.
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:01.080]  So how do you get an 83% blocking or suppression of new infections?
[1:38:01.080 --> 1:38:06.080]  You go Italy style, you do what Italy did, you lock down the whole country.
[1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:17.080]  Look Alex, I'm not saying that I want this to happen, I'm saying that this is what the math tells us must happen and if we don't go that route, if Trump just does nothing and says it's all going to be fine,
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:26.080]  then by the end of May the hospitals are overrun and then we have a national healthcare crisis that is way worse than having everybody stay home for three to four weeks.
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:40.080]  So you have to break the cycle of the exponential spread and in effect Italy has made a legitimate decision that will save millions of lives down the road for Italy and I'll see it.
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:42.080]  Mike Adams, let me ask this question.
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:48.080]  I go back to it, lands it at a small sample, said 15% debt or whatever, we now know that's overblown.
[1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:50.080]  Now we're looking at 2%, it just keeps going down and down.
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:55.080]  You got a bunch of sick people that are already going to the hospital, well they're the ones that are really sick.
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:01.080]  So it's a widespread virus, the evidence shows, just like the flu, so some are going to die.
[1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:09.080]  Well the folks showing up and getting tested because of lack of testing kits, it's going to create the false number of a high number of debt.
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:12.080]  I'm just playing devil's advocate there, what do you think?
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:22.080]  Well the death rate in Italy is now about 5% because Italy has a strain that has a much higher fatality rate and Italy is doing good testing.
[1:39:23.080 --> 1:39:26.080]  So a lot of this depends on which mutation you get and since it's spreading uncontrolled in America.
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:28.080]  So 5% that is just, that's horrible.
[1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:34.080]  Well right, and the other thing Alex, and I appreciate you playing devil's advocate, we need to question each other on this.
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:45.080]  I really appreciate this process, but if the hospitals get overrun, which could happen late May, then the death rate skyrockets to 5, 10, 15%.
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:51.080]  So you have to keep the number of people out of the hospitals, you have to make sure the hospitals don't get overrun.
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:53.080]  Otherwise your health is going to go through.
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:40:01.080]  You got a gear up for it like it's really serious, and I think you're right, they're saying, I saw that, they think it's about 5% in Italy, that is just doomsday level.
[1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:04.080]  I mean 5% folks that will just devastate stuff, create total hysteria.
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:10.080]  But you're pointing out them locking things down is now slow to spread from where that was originally happening.
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:13.080]  We now see in the models the lockdowns work.
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:15.080]  So people keep asking me for solutions.
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:18.080]  I know they're probably asking you too, why are you always talking about the problem?
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:20.080]  Talk about solutions.
[1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:22.080]  Okay, guess what?
[1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:24.080]  You're not going to like the solution folks.
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:25.080]  It's a lockdown, it's medical martial law, and it's already begun in New York.
[1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:27.080]  That's the solution.
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:29.080]  That's actually what ends this virus in America.
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:30.080]  It's going to stop it in 30 days.
[1:40:31.080 --> 1:40:32.080]  But it's going to be 30 days a hell.
[1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:34.080]  Okay, so that's the truth.
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:36.080]  That's the reality, that's why China did it.
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:38.080]  That's why Italy is doing it, that's why South Korea is doing it.
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:43.080]  Everywhere they do lockdowns and massive quarantines, you start to see the numbers really taper off.
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:46.080]  Now we have two futures to choose from here in America.
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:49.080]  A future where by the summer you have millions of Americans dead.
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:51.080]  That's if you do nothing.
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:54.080]  Or a future where you only have a few thousand people dead.
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:40:56.080]  That's if you have massive lockdowns.
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:58.080]  Those are the only two futures here in the short term.
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:02.080]  If you're right, the bad scenario is correct, which I know you're just wargaming.
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:06.080]  If that scenario is correct, then they'll say, oh, it was all a hoax because we saved all the people.
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:09.080]  I've always noticed when we do the right thing and warn people,
[1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:13.080]  then those that warned of it and stopped the crisis, oh, we were just fear mongers.
[1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:17.080]  Well, look, they're never going to say anything nice about us no matter what we do.
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:19.080]  My goal here is to try to...
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:23.080]  No, no, you certainly called that it was going to be really big for the economy
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:25.080]  and that it was going to be...
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:27.080]  That Trump was going to get blamed for this.
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:30.080]  And just, I mean, they're doing it. They're like white on rice right now.
[1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:34.080]  Well, the upshot is, look, the CDC had just announced a few hours ago
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:38.080]  that this outbreak is totally uncontained in certain areas now.
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:42.080]  We said that four weeks ago, five weeks ago, we said it's uncontained.
[1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:44.080]  It's broken containment. That was the headline.
[1:41:45.080 --> 1:41:47.080]  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Info wars had that a month ago.
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:51.080]  And now the CDC is telling people over 60 to start stockpiling food.
[1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:53.080]  That was Nancy Messonnier yesterday.
[1:41:54.080 --> 1:41:57.080]  Start stockpiling food if you're over 60 and be ready for an extended quarantine.
[1:41:58.080 --> 1:41:59.080]  She's giving out hints.
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:02.080]  Well, I totally agree with you. You're over really 65 or 70.
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:06.080]  You damn well better quarantine during this because the numbers are clear on that.
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:09.080]  You're rolling the dice if you're 70 years old or so.
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:14.080]  Well, the truth is now everybody, everybody needs to prepare to be in isolation for 30 days.
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:17.080]  I was looking at my dad last night talking to him and I just love him so much.
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:20.080]  And he's an overall healthy guy. But man, he's 70 years old.
[1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:23.080]  And I just don't want that sweetheart of my mom. She's so awesome.
[1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:26.080]  You're damn right. The numbers are clear.
[1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:29.080]  Briefly, I know you got to go, but I want to do five more minutes and we'll go to the callers.
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:33.080]  Well, Mike, do this. Join us tomorrow as soon as you can.
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:36.080]  Or come on the war room with Owen or David Knight.
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:38.080]  I know they really want to get you on. Thank you so much, Mike.
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:39.080]  Thank you.
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:42.080]  All right. I got Austin. I got Robert. I got Hobbes.
[1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:44.080]  Hobbes is up next up here, Austin. I got Steve.
[1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:47.080]  I got Bob. I got John. I got Tim. I got Chase. I got Judy.
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:50.080]  We're going to everybody, including Judy. She's actually up next.
[1:42:51.080 --> 1:42:53.080]  But first, a special report I just cut.
[1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:59.080]  We always promote being prepared, having firearms, knowing how to use them
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:02.080]  and be self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden.
[1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:05.080]  I mean, it's just, it's what we're meant to do. It feels good when we do it.
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:07.080]  But we do sell high quality, swarble food.
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:10.080]  I told my patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle?
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:12.080]  I said, I think it's going to be really big.
[1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:13.080]  And they said, well, you can handle probably this.
[1:43:14.080 --> 1:43:16.080]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund.
[1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:18.080]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge.
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:20.080]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food,
[1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:22.080]  even though the prices are going up for you.
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:24.080]  So those are the top discussions we have.
[1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:26.080]  Now I'm just giving the inside baseball of all of us.
[1:43:27.080 --> 1:43:28.080]  This is a hundred times regular volume plus.
[1:43:29.080 --> 1:43:30.080]  It was a hundred times a few days ago.
[1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:32.080]  Now it's about 200 times. Okay.
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:35.080]  At infowarstore.com, you go right in the queue, first come, first serve.
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:38.080]  But the fact that the orders are so ultramassive, it's dizzying.
[1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:40.080]  I mean, this is just insane.
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:42.080]  We're expecting that to put six to eight weeks to be safe.
[1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:47.080]  And then if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:49.080]  Everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food.
[1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:51.080]  But that's how big this is.
[1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:55.080]  So what you're getting is a hundred percent the straight deal of what's going on infowarstore.com.
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:43:57.080]  Rich in Alabama, Rich, thanks for calling.
[1:43:58.080 --> 1:43:59.080]  Hey, Mr. Jones, appreciate it.
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:01.080]  First thing, I love the turbo force.
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:05.080]  I drive truck for a living and it's amazing.
[1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:08.080]  Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end,
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:10.080]  but that's turbo force is amazing.
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:12.080]  How is turbo force different than coffee?
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:17.080]  I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours.
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:21.080]  I don't feel the jitters like I do drinking coffee.
[1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:25.080]  And it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:28.080]  I'll, you know, knock out them, I'm out cold.
[1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:32.080]  Well, that's what we went out to a top developer who didn't want his name on it.
[1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:36.080]  And I said, what would the ultimate long, say, 10 hour energy be?
[1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:37.080]  Is that possible?
[1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:41.080]  That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:43.080]  that are healthy and natural that are time-released.
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:46.080]  And there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product.
[1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:49.080]  So that's why turbo force has such a great effect.
[1:44:49.080 --> 1:45:16.080]  And so I really appreciate you and I'm glad that you like turbo force.
[1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:19.080]  And that means it gets you.
[1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:28.080]  So however you're going to do it, now is the time to get ready and to get prepared with emergency supplies and items that are known to boost your immune system.
[1:45:29.080 --> 1:45:33.080]  They're all at infowarstore.com, high quality, durable food when nobody else has got it.
[1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:43.080]  Super powerful formulas like DNA force plus X2, X3, bodies, ultimate turmeric formula and our nano silver line of products,
[1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:48.080]  a bunch of which has been sold out, but a bunch of which is coming back in later this week.
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:46:13.080]  So check it all out at infowarstore.com and get prepared.
[1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:22.080]  And that's just in one nation.
[1:46:23.080 --> 1:46:26.080]  Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China.
[1:46:27.080 --> 1:46:31.080]  They're reporting it could cut their sales in half this year.
[1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:34.080]  That's how major this is.
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:37.080]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:40.080]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:45.080]  Info wars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out.
[1:46:45.080 --> 1:46:49.080]  Regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:47:18.080]  We need you to step into the plate and help spread the word about band.video and infowarstore.com today.
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:34.080]  Just six weeks ago, President Trump won the trade war against the communist Chinese and I said on air, they're getting ready to strike back.
[1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:46.080]  Then President Trump came out and announced that coming up on April 15th, he would launch a new huge tax cut for the middle class that would be sure to supercharge our economy even more.
[1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:52.080]  Well, the deep state has struck back and they admit they're openly trying to tank our economy.
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:48:00.080]  Panic attack. The coronavirus has unleashed a wave of panic across the country, evidenced by runs on hand sanitizer and face masks.
[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:04.080]  Breaking news, markets just opened and down 1700.
[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:10.080]  Here in the United States, 607 cases, 26 deaths in 36 states.
[1:48:11.080 --> 1:48:13.080]  Some members of Congress in self quarantine.
[1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:20.080]  We are at a critical moment with governments around the world taking action and companies canceling travel and cities calling off big public gatherings.
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:25.080]  The Dow headed for its worst single day point loss since the great recession and the financial crisis.
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:27.080]  The biggest one day point drop ever.
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:30.080]  With stocks falling more than 2000 points.
[1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:40.080]  The largest tech companies including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Amazon wiping out more than $320 billion in value.
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:46.080]  The coronavirus weighs on demand when factories are closed, people aren't traveling, consumers aren't out and about.
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:52.080]  What is the sense of what the odds are that this tips us into recession and how should the government respond?
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:54.080]  This is not a great number for President Trump.
[1:48:55.080 --> 1:49:01.080]  You see here is approval rating on handling of coronavirus is 41% every hour, every day.
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:03.080]  You can feel the spread of the virus.
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:07.080]  Here's the deal. This is why we're panicked.
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:10.080]  There's a place called Hard Labor in Georgia.
[1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:14.080]  Yes, it's a former prisoner camp for slave labor.
[1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:24.080]  And now the governor has announced the state police are setting up a camp for people that test positive for the coronavirus.
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:34.080]  The hysteria that we predicted six weeks ago that we witnessed in China has now been exported to the United States.
[1:49:34.080 --> 1:49:36.080]  And the whole thing is a giant fraud.
[1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:42.080]  The whole thing is a huge, big pharma, deep state, shy, calm hoax.
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:58.080]  The state is also working to get another space ready if needed like Hard Labor Creek State Park.
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:04.080]  That means there would be places to care for and house patients possibly exposed to coronavirus.
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:06.080]  This park is in Morgan County.
[1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:11.080]  It's more than 5000 acres, but the state is going to block off a section for potential patients.
[1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:15.080]  The governor stressed that this is an example of being ready and cautious.
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:17.080]  The hope is that it wouldn't have to be used.
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:21.080]  As of now, there are no plans to transfer any patients to the park.
[1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:27.080]  The state's even put in seven emergency trailers and needed supplies ready there at that location.
[1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:29.080]  More materials are also on the way.
[1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:39.080]  When I say it's a hoax, many will say you're the first people to raise the alarm and say this is incredibly dangerous.
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:45.080]  But if you go back to the articles and the reports and the live shows we did with top experts from around the world,
[1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:49.080]  including the author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law and many others,
[1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:56.080]  it was the fact that it was a man-made virus transferred by Obama in Homeland Security in 2015 to China.
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:05.080]  And that it's a chimera, at least four different viruses spliced together with the HIV delivery system in it.
[1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:17.080]  Wuhan scientists took the North Carolina SARS with gain of function, which is already a biological warfare weapon,
[1:51:17.080 --> 1:51:25.080]  and they took the technology here behind this well-developed SARS HIV weapon.
[1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:43.080]  And they all brought it back to the Wuhan BSL floor and tried to DNA genetically engineered into a camera into a biological warfare weapon,
[1:51:43.080 --> 1:51:50.080]  involving the coronavirus, the HIV virus, and gain of function.
[1:51:51.080 --> 1:52:00.080]  Gain of function work can only be done safely in a BSL-4 or a BSL-3 facility.
[1:52:00.080 --> 1:52:17.080]  So I think clearly this is the smoking gun, and there is no legitimate scientific or medical use for gain of function technology, DNA technology on biowarfare agents.
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:20.080]  So there's no excuse that it's a vaccine test that got out?
[1:52:21.080 --> 1:52:28.080]  That's blowing. This is clearly an offensive biological warfare agent.
[1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:36.080]  So this was always China incubating the weapon there, transferring it here, using our open free society as a way to spread it,
[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:47.080]  and then having the media and the left hype, a stock market crash, something Bill Maher and CNN and MSNBC and all of them said they hoped the coronavirus would cause just a few weeks ago.
[1:52:48.080 --> 1:52:52.080]  And now that it is, they're openly celebrating all of this.
[1:52:52.080 --> 1:53:06.080]  So now our predictions of six weeks ago have come true out of the words and deeds of the establishment itself, because all their tactics to bring America to its knees and to punish us for electing Donald Trump.
[1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:12.080]  I've been hoping for a recession. People hate me for it, but it would get rid of Trump, so you shouldn't hate me for it.
[1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:17.080]  I mean, recessions are really bad. People lose their jobs in those homes, and we shouldn't wish for it.
[1:53:17.080 --> 1:53:23.080]  It's worth it. But I don't, I mean, a recession is always possible. I don't see any particular reason to think that it's likely.
[1:53:24.080 --> 1:53:27.080]  Really? Aren't we overdue for one just by the cycle of economics?
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:31.080]  This is such a misconception. People sort of feel like, oh, you know, well, about every eight years or something, you're supposed to have it.
[1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:36.080]  Recessions don't come because they're due. Recessions come because there's some sort of overheating. Something goes wrong in the economy.
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:47.080]  But let's get to the biggest piece of evidence that this is all hyped up propaganda, that it's a way to stampet us like Lemmings off the edge of a police state globalist financial cliff.
[1:53:48.080 --> 1:54:00.080]  We've pointed out for years under Obama and under Trump and under Bush before him that there is black plague and drug-resistant TB and so many other deadly diseases pouring across the southern border.
[1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:07.080]  And the border patrols overwhelmed. Under Obama, they stopped even testing and just let people in and put them in schools next to your children.
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:14.080]  But oh, now, don't you worry, those borders have got to stay wide open. Those flights got to keep coming in.
[1:54:15.080 --> 1:54:22.080]  But if you test positive at the doctor, why, we're going to lock you up in a prison camp. You don't leave the borders wide open.
[1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:32.080]  You don't protect the people coming in that could have had the virus and then wait till it spreads, wait till it incubates and then tell everybody, oh, we've got to have highway checkpoints.
[1:54:33.080 --> 1:54:41.080]  We've got to shut the schools down. We've got to totally panic and Ted Cruz has got to be a good virtue signal and self-quarantine because he might have shook somebody's hand that might have had it.
[1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:48.080]  And now, of course, we learn President Trump was at CPAC and he might have been close to the person that had it. He might have shaken their hand.
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:55:00.080]  This has hysteria written all over it. And now it's exploding, ladies and gentlemen. What is this story covering up? What other information is it smoke screening?
[1:55:01.080 --> 1:55:06.080]  Well, it came out two months ago that the UN's own top scientist admits vaccines are hurting people. There's a cover up.
[1:55:07.080 --> 1:55:15.080]  Major court cases have just been won by anti-vaccine groups exposing the fact they've never had safe or effective studies and that they actually have secret funds to pay people off.
[1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:24.080]  All of this information is coming out about the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others who had a drill in November of tens of millions dead from the virus.
[1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:30.080]  And now they have a bunch of special testing systems they're going to send out to everyone so we can have as much hysteria as possible.
[1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:51.080]  Today, the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. Instead, it looks like this. If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war.
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:55.080]  Not missiles, but microbes.
[1:55:55.080 --> 1:56:06.080]  They intend to use this crisis that they've engineered to bring down President Trump and kill the American recovery. Info wars has been dead on so far predicting how big this crisis would be.
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:16.080]  The crisis is real. The crisis is huge because the coronavirus is the hysteria the media and governments need to create this wave of fear.
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:33.080]  How deadly is the virus itself? We still don't know. But as evidence mounts, it looks like the CDC didn't put out testing kits because it would have shown how many people already had it over a month ago and who hadn't died or who weren't sick.
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:45.080]  The CDC is working against Trump to first tell him it's not a problem, so he would try to tell people it was okay. Then when he did that, they came out and said, oh, you didn't respond right, now it's all your fault.
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:54.080]  You've also got three of the top CEOs resigning on Sunday night ahead of this. You've got all this other big giant seismic action taking place.
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:57:07.080]  You've got indictments being announced for Hunter Biden and others. You've got Hillary now back under criminal investigation. And so the deep state with their client state, Communist China is striking back right now.
[1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:24.080]  Well, that's most of that powerful report that Rob Do and I put together last night. Deep state using coronavirus fear and panic, destroy our country. We were up here. I was up until seven working on that. He was up until one in the morning.
[1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:36.080]  He's shared a deep state using coronavirus fear and panic, destroy our country. And again, we're chronicling a different guest every angle of it. That's why it's not one view or the other. It's all the views to really create a synergy and a college of ideas.
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:44.080]  Don't forget, we've got great nano silver products that are great for your body. Bodies hold the tumor for almost back in stock. DNA Force Plus, all 40% off.
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:54.080]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[1:57:55.080 --> 1:58:05.080]  He's like, well, what are you doing? Just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people. And so here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:17.080]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:27.080]  And the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[1:58:27.080 --> 1:58:36.080]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[1:58:57.080 --> 1:59:22.080]  So right now humanity is awakening. It's explosive. It's powerful. It's incredible. But there's major obstacles coming down the road. And the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game like MFW or Citizens of the Spirit is your financial support.
[1:59:22.080 --> 1:59:33.080]  We make it really easy at infowarstore.com. But I am blowing through our back of money right now with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered to do it.
[1:59:34.080 --> 1:59:42.080]  And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week during this election year that's so critical but they need the financing to put them in the field.
[1:59:42.080 --> 1:59:53.080]  Go to infowarstore.com and fight for your own future.
[2:00:12.080 --> 2:00:14.080]  Thanks for that cut short. Finish your point. Thanks, Rowley.
[2:00:15.080 --> 2:00:25.080]  Thanks, Alex. So I worked at Apple over five years. I live in Florida. I have a diverse sprint group. So I'm no stranger to culture. But this past year I have lived in Minnesota.
[2:00:26.080 --> 2:00:35.080]  And brother, I cannot believe, I guess, I'm a stranger in my own country. The Somali president, you would not believe it. I've seen it firsthand.
[2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:38.080]  Oh yeah, Minnesota is now a new Somalia.
[2:00:38.080 --> 2:00:53.080]  It's absolutely unbelievable. There are certain towns where they have to absolutely take part of the school board, the churches, the banks, and have these specific towns where they own every large specific business and no one can buy properties to business there.
[2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:56.080]  I mean, it's incredible.
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:00:58.080]  It's an Islamic mafia.
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:07.080]  It absolutely is. It absolutely is. They're even part of our state representation there, representing our own country. You know, and last thing, I know you got other callers.
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:16.080]  I'd love to talk to the team potentially about some opportunities with music. I was a producer on Spotify and Apple and things like that. So I'd love to connect with that there.
[2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:20.080]  All right, brother, that kind of broke up at the end, but thank you, Austin.
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:23.080]  Okay, let's go ahead and jam another call in.
[2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:27.080]  Who's up next here? Judy, thanks for holding in Florida. Welcome.
[2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:29.080]  Hi, Alex.
[2:01:30.080 --> 2:01:32.080]  A story that has an ending.
[2:01:33.080 --> 2:01:43.080]  When you mentioned Merle Haggard, it made me think about John Denver a few months before he died. I saw him in concert and he sounded better than ever.
[2:01:43.080 --> 2:01:58.080]  And he was singing at a place called Wolf Trap Farm Park, which was a beautiful auditorium that my former in-laws used to refurbish the wood of, and I had box seats there.
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:19.080]  But the point of that is Smitty's Lumberteria, which was the lumber and hardware store that was building counties in Maryland, D.C. and Virginia, went bankrupt in 2009 after what happened in 2008 with the housing freeze and credit freeze.
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:23.080]  And it's now a massive Chinese grocery store.
[2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:33.080]  And I got to taste firsthand of what that crash actually meant when I thought I was actually going to have the condo that I had as part of my retirement income.
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:35.080]  That's how I wound up in Florida.
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:50.080]  And it was really humbling last week to hear you mention Hillsborough and Manatee County as being these places that were infected with the coronavirus, and I think it was last week, because those are the counties that my son and I live in.
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:52.080]  Yes, it was.
[2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:59.080]  And yeah, so what I call all of this is war.
[2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:02.080]  I don't think that China is done with us yet.
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:09.080]  And I do think that the reason why President Trump looks haggard right now is probably even more than you.
[2:03:10.080 --> 2:03:12.080]  And I think you and I both stare into the abyss.
[2:03:13.080 --> 2:03:17.080]  I think a lot of us that have minds do, that are Christians.
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:19.080]  And they're right.
[2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:22.080]  Trump's trying to read the enemy, and they're so evil.
[2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:24.080]  It just gets to you.
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:25.080]  You can't lie about that.
[2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:28.080]  Well, I think that he's blackmailed in ways.
[2:03:29.080 --> 2:03:32.080]  I think there are things that he knows that his hands are tied about.
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:35.080]  Well, bigger than that, if he takes this out, it drops that.
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:39.080]  So it's not like you're even corrupt, but if you blow this up, it blows that up, that collapses this good thing.
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:42.080]  And once you get into this 3D chess, it's just insane.
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:53.080]  Well, I mean, I told the screener that it was yesterday I was at the gym and I see Hillary and Obama, you know, with impunity on the mainstream.
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:58.080]  They're parading around, strutting around, pissing on us.
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:03.080]  Yeah, and former Green Beret John Moore was talking on the Hagman Report.
[2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:05.080]  I think you should have him on.
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:06.080]  I like John Moore.
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:07.080]  Let's get John Moore on.
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:09.080]  Yeah, like immediately.
[2:04:09.080 --> 2:04:13.080]  He was talking about how she could come in as a compromise candidate.
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:15.080]  And I think that's what she's chomping on the bit to do.
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:17.080]  Oh, I mean, not to give.
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:19.080]  I mean, John Moore is a good guy.
[2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:24.080]  We're like Appalachia or I guess out of the Missouri there in the, what do you call those?
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:25.080]  The Ozarks.
[2:04:26.080 --> 2:04:33.080]  But I mean, we've been day one, not territorializing this, but we've been tip of the spear exposing that Hillary plans to run again.
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:35.080]  Doesn't mean she will, though.
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:38.080]  She wants to be in control of the party until the last minute.
[2:04:39.080 --> 2:04:39.080]  Thank you so much, Judy.
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:40.080]  We love you.
[2:04:41.080 --> 2:04:41.080]  All right.
[2:04:42.080 --> 2:04:42.080]  More calls.
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:44.080]  60 seconds away.
[2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:47.080]  Whatever you do, do not spread the live links and shows.
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:50.080]  Don't tell folks about Info Wars because then we might win.
[2:04:54.080 --> 2:05:01.080]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[2:05:02.080 --> 2:05:02.080]  That's good.
[2:05:02.080 --> 2:05:04.080]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:11.080]  The average person is living hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[2:05:12.080 --> 2:05:15.080]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[2:05:16.080 --> 2:05:22.080]  And that means even with just the basics, even a three week food supply that you know is always there that you only go to an emergency.
[2:05:23.080 --> 2:05:28.080]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical or even more so.
[2:05:28.080 --> 2:05:36.080]  And things like DNA Force Plus that's now back in stock is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:46.080]  It's back in stock 40% off right now along with Ultra-12 and along with Vito-Emineral Fusion and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.
[2:05:47.080 --> 2:05:51.080]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today and support the Info War while living a healthy and better life.
[2:05:51.080 --> 2:05:58.080]  A total 360 win.
[2:06:21.080 --> 2:06:34.080]  Let's go ahead and go to the phone calls here as we try to get through all these great folks.
[2:06:35.080 --> 2:06:48.080]  Up next, holding the longest would be, is it Hobbes or is it Steve or is it Robert, is it Chris, is it, I guess it's Bob in New York.
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:50.080]  Bob, thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:54.080]  Hey, Alex. Love you, man. Sorry you had a bad night.
[2:06:55.080 --> 2:06:59.080]  Oh, hey, it was good. I mean, I mean, I look for the attack that comes out of it. It's just, it is what it is.
[2:07:00.080 --> 2:07:01.080]  Yeah, it is what it is.
[2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:11.080]  So listen, I called you a few weeks ago in the, you know, before Corona, obviously, and you were asking people, what are they going to do next, what are they going to do next?
[2:07:11.080 --> 2:07:20.080]  And I came up with what we should do was a million man march. It sounds kind of silly now considering how serious things are now.
[2:07:21.080 --> 2:07:26.080]  But, you know, the callers, I mean, thank you for taking my call with the allowing my speech on your platform.
[2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:29.080]  Appreciate you, brother. Thank you for letting this platform exist. Seriously.
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:40.080]  Let me tell you, you thinking me is the, is the tail wagging the dog. You are the dog, brother. Without the listeners, this dog don't hunt.
[2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:47.080]  So I want you guys to get that in your head that thinking me, oh, great. Yeah, we're on the same page. I love you too.
[2:07:48.080 --> 2:07:51.080]  But you understand, you're not just like some part. You're the engine, brother. You understand that?
[2:07:51.080 --> 2:07:58.080]  Dig it. I'm the dog, man. So we all are, you know, and I am the tail.
[2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:06.080]  Now the tail is cool and it wags and shows what the dog is thinking. But think about it. You're the dog. The listeners and the supporters, you're the dog.
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:13.080]  You're the eyes or the nose or the ears, you're the claws, you're the guts, you're the heart, you're the hair, you're the teeth.
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:16.080]  I mean, you're the will, you're the brain.
[2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:23.080]  Well, thank you. Listen, listen, you're the tits. I mean, take care of the next little puppy dogs. You're the people, man.
[2:08:24.080 --> 2:08:27.080]  You are the whole nine yards, brother. Go ahead.
[2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:34.080]  All right. That's funny. You say that because I think number one, your beard gives your shoulders and chest symmetry in your head is a beautiful tip.
[2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:42.080]  Oh, that's funny. That's funny. I did as a stunt. Probably gonna grow back out. I just can't look at myself.
[2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:48.080]  No, no, no. Enough about that. I'm just saying the whole dog does amazing things. And so to say on the tail is the truth.
[2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:50.080]  Go ahead. Go ahead and finish up.
[2:08:51.080 --> 2:09:03.080]  Well, when you let people on the show and they just come up with such ideas, I mean, the other day, a guy said that, or two days ago, one day ago, that this is how they get the corona inside the Trump White House.
[2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:08.080]  You know, instead of an assassin, they get a virus in there. Put it in CPAC.
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:25.080]  I had an argument with a buddy years ago about the global quote unquote warming, how well when the news networks start televising every raindrop for three days before the hurricane comes and they stay for three days, you know, looks like there's some real catastrophic thing happening.
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:28.080]  And it seems like that's what they're doing here.
[2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:40.080]  No, I agree. But the way the chai comms had drills and everywhere they had military drills in Italy, you know, it pops up, you know, they have little leftist going along with little air bottles like shooting out the virus, you know it.
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:55.080]  Yeah, this is uglier than we want to believe. And, you know, Mike Adams is way on it. And so, I mean, we're sitting around waiting for Trump. I think Trump is going down in history just for exposing the mainstream media and the collusion between.
[2:09:55.080 --> 2:10:03.080]  Oh, and standing up to him. I mean, he's definitely but what you just said is important. They arrested all these Chinese scientists trying to sneak vials in and vials out of weird stuff.
[2:10:04.080 --> 2:10:15.080]  They busted the head scientist at Harvard work for the chai comms. They Trump is rolling up their networks. They have launched this attack. And absolutely. That's what they're saying. Oh, there's more deadly versions popping up.
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:22.080]  Yeah, because the chai comms are launching it. So then I started thinking Mike Adams was right. We better just self quarantine right now.
[2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:32.080]  Let me just tell the chai comms something. Any of my family gets hurt. I'm going to hold them personally responsible. So just just just tell them. Go ahead, sir.
[2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:43.080]  Yeah, and I, you know, I said to another buddy, how do they be Trump with this Joe Biden and Bernie and they don't either they kill Trump or they kill 20 million voters.
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:52.080]  Exactly. That's it. They're not going to let him get in there. They're done. They're going to launch civil war and try to kill the president. I totally agree. God bless you. Bob was another powerful caller.
[2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:56.080]  Powerful Jedi. You have done well Lord Vida.
[2:10:57.080 --> 2:11:04.080]  All right, let's go to Hobbs in Nebraska, Hobbs and then Robert and everybody else. Thanks for holding Hobbs. Alex, how we're doing?
[2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:06.080]  I'm good. I'm all the map here.
[2:11:07.080 --> 2:11:08.080]  All right, cool.
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:12.080]  I had no sleep last night. I was in a lavish area.
[2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:29.080]  I called at the end of the war room last night about an article that popped up by a group called the network contagion research institute about three days before all this coronavirus stuff popped off and it kind of got lost in the sauce.
[2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:38.080]  It had to do with the so-called Boogaloo memes and it's trying to make Second Amendment supporters out to be like the next Al Qaeda, the next ISIS.
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:46.080]  It's a group funded by your typical who's who of globalist bad actors like the ADL, the Open Societies Foundation.
[2:11:46.080 --> 2:12:00.080]  The thing that really bothered me the most is that the podcast that I'm a part of is mentioned specifically and my name specifically is also mentioned in a screen grab there.
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:06.080]  So, you know, these are some friends of mine that were most heavily featured in the article.
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:15.080]  And now you've learned that because you've been effective, the globalist, the enemy is watching you. Isn't that a fun feeling?
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:19.080]  Isn't it kind of exciting you actually to know that that scum knows you're breathing down their neck?
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:23.080]  Yeah, actually it does. I wear it like a badge of honor now.
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:35.080]  Yeah, so my podcast is mentioned in one of the captions. It's Roads to Liberty. You can subscribe to us on pretty much any podcasting app or also over at thinkliberty.com.
[2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:45.080]  And I'm actually kind of looking forward to see if this has any effect on me personally because I'm also running for Congress this year.
[2:12:45.080 --> 2:12:57.080]  Brother, I'll tell you this. When they told the Pentagon, the Army and the Marine Corps first not to go to Info Wars, I later learned it was a sigh out by patriots, not the top, but they knew how dumb the old gloves were.
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:04.080]  Sarah Jones is dangerous. We want you to put a command level order nationwide to not visit Info Wars. Listen to him.
[2:13:05.080 --> 2:13:11.080]  I was like barely paying the bills and had a decent audience in like 1997. The audience tripled in one week.
[2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:17.080]  I was like money just went because the military was all listening and buying everything.
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:23.080]  And that's again, these globalists are like literally have like five heart transplants and we don't even know what planet they're on.
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:35.080]  And the people out of them are like, sir, let's do this. It's like, it's like Dr. Cornbluth's memory splash and his assistants go, let's pee down his arrows.
[2:13:35.080 --> 2:13:50.080]  I'm sorry, but I'm just saying there's that, there's that Tyler Durgan, or however you say it, fight club thing that there's not just evil in the world and people don't like the globalist.
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:13:58.080]  That's why they want computers in to control what you do. So you're a robot to follow computers orders so you don't have discretion in your life so they can get away with all this.
[2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:05.080]  But look, we're not out of the woods. I'm not even saying we're winning, but we've just begun to fight and we are kicking ass brother.
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:09.080]  Hobbs, I appreciate your call. I gotta move on here. Thanks a lot of calls.
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:11.080]  Who's up next here?
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:15.080]  That would be John in Florida. John, thanks for holding it on the air.
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:17.080]  Hello.
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:19.080]  Yes, sir.
[2:14:19.080 --> 2:14:32.080]  As one of the great prophets once said it, the world is filled with kings and queens that will blind your eyes and steal your dreams and thank God that we got you, Mike Adams and the rest of the crew protecting all of us out here.
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:35.080]  We got to come in with that black Sabbath tune now.
[2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:41.080]  Slow down. Slow down. Don't play it. Hey, listen, brother, I just got to say what nobody else is saying. All right.
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:50.080]  In my heart, my gut feeling, you said follow your gut feeling. Dude, 100%. This is retaliation for taking out Salomani.
[2:14:51.080 --> 2:14:53.080]  One way or the other, whether or not we took them out and they did it.
[2:14:54.080 --> 2:15:01.080]  No, exactly. He killed the fake globalist, al-Qaeda network and Trump's pulling out all these wars and this is a chai-com attack right now.
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:12.080]  Dude, whatever it is, people need to pray, protect themselves, love one another and understand in this world, there's only two kind of people, good people and bad people.
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:15.080]  That's all there is, brother. I love you, Alex. God bless you.
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:22.080]  Don't hang up, John. I'm going to come back because you can take something like the name of a man, black Sabbath, and then some songs are evil.
[2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:25.080]  Some songs are actually very Christian about God comes back, destroys the devil.
[2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:31.080]  I mean, listen to some of those Ozzy songs, the early ones. It's like, he had said later on, actually Christian, I was told the record companies would be a Satanist for money.
[2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:35.080]  And I don't know people who know Ozzy. That's actually, I'm not defending Ozzy, the point is.
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:40.080]  But if you listen to Rodney James Dio's Black Sabbath, we're going to play the song and we'll come back as part of it.
[2:15:41.080 --> 2:15:44.080]  The world is full of kings and queens. Blind your eyes and steal your dreams. It's heaven and hell.
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:48.080]  And they'll tell you black is really white. The moon is just the sun at night.
[2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:51.080]  It's a key passage we're going to play when we come back in your phone calls.

[2:18:54.080 --> 2:19:02.080]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared.
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:09.080]  And instead of just giving in to sickness care, take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:16.080]  And I say that from personal experience because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day.
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:26.080]  And that power pack that they have, the AMPM power pack, well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:35.080]  I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world,
[2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:48.080]  one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself, remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose for our families and for our communities.
[2:19:48.080 --> 2:19:56.080]  And right now, folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[2:20:18.080 --> 2:20:26.080]  Here it is, roaring off the devil. Listen to it. Everything is the opposite of what you've been told.
[2:20:29.080 --> 2:20:35.080]  When you find the devils, you'll see those fake preachers. You'll see those Democrats telling you they're going to empower you.
[2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:44.080]  They say that lights up yourself. It ain't fast you gotta ride as well. The world is full of things between the blind and the deaf.
[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:54.080]  And they'll tell you black is really white. And they'll tell you black is really white. The world is just the sun at night.
[2:20:54.080 --> 2:21:04.080]  And when you walk in golden halls, you get the jeans, the clothes, the clothes, and the hair. Oh, no.
[2:21:07.080 --> 2:21:10.080]  You've got to flee from the dead, son.
[2:21:10.080 --> 2:21:22.080]  Look for the answer. The answer. Truth.
[2:21:27.080 --> 2:21:31.080]  Alright, John and Florida, you brought that up. You got it. You just got what you wanted right there.
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:38.080]  Ronnie is smiling at you from the grave. Ronnie is helping us all, brother. I love you, Alex.
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:42.080]  So what's your point? You're making some great points on the virus and wound on it.
[2:21:43.080 --> 2:21:52.080]  I mean, this is admittedly a weapon. It's admittedly an attack on America. And all the Democrats, everybody rooting for the country to go down, it's like, it should be over.
[2:21:53.080 --> 2:22:00.080]  They don't even a party anymore when you do that. It's like ridiculous. Imagine if I went on air and went, I hope this virus destroys America and screw everybody.
[2:22:00.080 --> 2:22:10.080]  I hope everybody loses their 401ks. I hope we go bankrupt. And I hate America's existence. That's what Democrats openly say. How do they get away with it, John?
[2:22:11.080 --> 2:22:17.080]  They don't get away with it, brother. That's why we got patriots. That's why we got you guys waking us all up and keeping us safe.
[2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:22.080]  You guys are heroes, too. My household, you guys are heroes. God bless every single one of you.
[2:22:23.080 --> 2:22:26.080]  In my household, you're heroes, man. We're all just defending ourselves.
[2:22:26.080 --> 2:22:35.080]  It's crazy times you're living in. Everybody needs to love a little more, peace a little more. I mean, this is craziness. What's going on?
[2:22:36.080 --> 2:22:43.080]  This is like the real deal is finally unfolding. And, you know, love each other, man. Don't hate each other. Love each other.
[2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:50.080]  No, I agree. When I go to the store and stuff, there's just so much hate. And that's why now I just decided to, like, just try to be as loving as I can.
[2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:55.080]  But I try to be nice to check out people. I get people tips and then no one's ever been nice to them.
[2:22:56.080 --> 2:22:59.080]  And I'm not trying to just my wife's like, what are you doing? You don't have the money to be handed out.
[2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:06.080]  Fifty dollar bills, the stewardesses and bell hops. And I said, man, they just they just it's just it's just none of it's trickling down.
[2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:11.080]  We got to do it. We got to do it. And that's what Trump's trying to do. And you can see they hate that. God bless you.
[2:23:12.080 --> 2:23:15.080]  I appreciate your call, John. OK, let's go to the next caller here.
[2:23:15.080 --> 2:23:19.080]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Detroit. Steve, thanks for holding. Welcome.
[2:23:20.080 --> 2:23:21.080]  Hey, Alex.
[2:23:21.080 --> 2:23:22.080]  Yes, sir.
[2:23:22.080 --> 2:23:26.080]  Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Been standing with you a long time. About 20 years.
[2:23:27.080 --> 2:23:34.080]  Brother, you've been standing me up and not in a bad way. I mean, you've literally been holding us up without you. I wouldn't be here.
[2:23:35.080 --> 2:23:39.080]  So thank you, brother. And thanks for keeping me in the fight. I want to tell the listeners every day just every day.
[2:23:39.080 --> 2:23:44.080]  I just go, I want to I want to keep me in the fight and show it. Thank you for keeping me in the fight, Steve.
[2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:52.080]  Yeah, thank you, brother. Also, I have four quick bullet points. But before I go into those, I would like to plug some of your products.
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:24:02.080]  I have the the Alexa pure gravity fed water filter, the Alexa pure breeze, great products right now paramount to have these items.
[2:24:02.080 --> 2:24:15.080]  Also, survival shield X to Carnivore and your gut fusion. I have some I've had some gut issues and these products have cleared cleared that right up.
[2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:18.080]  So I wanted to make sure I got that out.
[2:24:19.080 --> 2:24:24.080]  Let me just say this, Steve, because it's hard to talk about things like this on air, even if you're confident, like I'm confident you're confident.
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:32.080]  I like to talk about it. But I've taken all our products. They're all revolutionary. They're all game changing. And it's it's been sold out for a while.
[2:24:33.080 --> 2:24:40.080]  It's back in next week. The key wheeler actually arrives tomorrow. But it is the natural defense and other products.
[2:24:41.080 --> 2:24:44.080]  All of these, the gut is the engine of the whole body.
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:50.080]  And, you know, the heart is the fuel pump. But the gut is where you get all the energy.
[2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:56.080]  And I knew all this stuff. I read the research, but I've never really actually took all of it.
[2:24:57.080 --> 2:25:01.080]  And man, people go like, Jones, you don't look great. You look a lot better than you used to. What the hell's your skin's glowing?
[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:10.080]  You know, I mean, I look like a gorilla. And it's all because I take the products and they just work and people take them and they go, I can't believe this works.
[2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:14.080]  So well, yeah, these are all missing link products. Sorry, I'm ranting. Go ahead.
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:22.080]  Yeah, they've been they've been instrumental in my recovery. I have rheumatoid arthritis and I got some neuropathy issues.
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:27.080]  I also DNA force that helps. It's helped a lot with my neuropathy issues in my gut.
[2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:35.080]  So moving forward, I want to get to these points because I don't want to take too much time away from the other callers here.
[2:25:35.080 --> 2:25:43.080]  Okay, we have Trump draining the swamp in his last last quarter of his first term here.
[2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:51.080]  So we see him. We've seen him turning up the heat. And mind you, I started warning people about three and a half months ago.
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:57.080]  Start buying water filter, start buying non perishable food item because my intuition was going off. Radar was going off.
[2:25:57.080 --> 2:26:08.080]  Okay, so you have Trump draining the swamp and then you have Hillary and Comey and these other buffoons that are on paper, guilty of treason.
[2:26:09.080 --> 2:26:10.080]  I mean, they're chargeable at any time.
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:17.080]  And we said, will they set a new call? Will they launch a war? Will they launch a bio weapon? They launched a bio weapon that Obama transferred five years ago to GGP.
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:21.080]  Exactly. And that's what I'm going to lead into my second bullet point.
[2:26:21.080 --> 2:26:30.080]  Okay, let's look into all those mass rounds of ammunition the alphabet agencies bought. I think it was around the same time.
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:41.080]  Okay, so what I see happened there is they went forward with a plan that was probably hatched at the Bilderberg meeting before that and then sent that coronavirus to China.
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:48.080]  The alphabet agencies started buying up the night vision and the billions of rounds of hollow point ammunition.
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:59.080]  And I've also been saying for years that the only way that they're going to be able to take our firearms is release some kind of a bio weapon that makes us afraid to congregate with the
[2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:07.080]  That's exactly right. But the good news is the average cop, and I don't lionize them as they got some bad ones, but the average military person or police officer is not bad.
[2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:09.080]  And so that's why the globalists have a problem.
[2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:12.080]  That's why they want to go to drones. That's why they want to use bio weapons to lock us down.
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:18.080]  And it's why they want to be able to send people in at night to just wipe your house out, like special forces would do.
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:21.080]  They say you're a terrorist. They just, they just laws rocket or grenade your house.
[2:27:22.080 --> 2:27:25.080]  Well, they haunt us during the night we hunt them during the day.
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:29.080]  So, you know, that's that's so so and we're not we don't want to hunt anybody.
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:34.080]  It's we don't want this civil war and we don't hunt the police and we don't hunt the military in a civil war.
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:41.080]  We go around them if we ever get to that point to the kingpins who are in the deck of cards who are running the show.
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:49.080]  We know who they are and it'll be their own security people in New Zealand and in Hawaii and in Montana and in Canada.
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:52.080]  That I can just tell you there's no conspiracy.
[2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:54.080]  I'm not submitting with people.
[2:27:55.080 --> 2:27:58.080]  They all are ready for when the globalists try to take America down.
[2:27:59.080 --> 2:28:02.080]  The first thing these globalists are going to get is garage.
[2:28:02.080 --> 2:28:06.080]  They're all going to get a wire wrap from their neck and they're going to get killed about 15 seconds.
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:08.080]  And I'm not at the global snow.
[2:28:09.080 --> 2:28:13.080]  I don't just say stuff. OK, you're all dead. OK, so go ahead and fill your hand.
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:16.080]  Go ahead and play your game. You're dead.
[2:28:17.080 --> 2:28:18.080]  I'm dead too, but it's fine. Let's go.
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:21.080]  So they know how it is and they're losing.
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:27.080]  So they want to use a creepy virus to scare us all so it's not people, but everybody knows what's happened.
[2:28:27.080 --> 2:28:35.080]  So if their virus is successful, all these globalists, not by my hand, I can just tell you the people know who you are.
[2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:40.080]  They're sick of you and they're going to break your neck.
[2:28:41.080 --> 2:28:46.080]  So get ready. They can't wait to wrap their hands around your dishonorable neck.
[2:28:47.080 --> 2:28:47.080]  Thank you, Steve.
[2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:52.080]  A bunch of calls straight ahead and Paul Joseph Watson takes over from Britannia.
[2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:57.080]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:58.080 --> 2:28:59.080]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:29:00.080 --> 2:29:01.080]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:07.080]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:12.080]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:12.080 --> 2:29:21.080]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:28.080]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:33.080]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:36.080]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[2:29:37.080 --> 2:29:37.080]  Get clean.
[2:29:38.080 --> 2:29:39.080]  Call now and learn more.
[2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:47.080]  800-506-6740-800-506-6740.
[2:29:48.080 --> 2:29:52.080]  That's 800-506-6740.
[2:29:55.080 --> 2:29:56.080]  Hannah Meneve, I'm pronouncing that right.
[2:29:57.080 --> 2:29:58.080]  What do you think is really going on and thanks for calling?
[2:29:59.080 --> 2:30:00.080]  So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago.
[2:30:01.080 --> 2:30:01.080]  I was getting ready.
[2:30:02.080 --> 2:30:04.080]  I went to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit.
[2:30:04.080 --> 2:30:08.080]  And I had my phone, I had my show going on, sticking on my pocket so I could hear it.
[2:30:09.080 --> 2:30:10.080]  I wasn't even in headphones.
[2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:13.080]  And this lady starts, she says, who are you listening to? Who is that talking?
[2:30:14.080 --> 2:30:15.080]  I said, this is Alex Jones.
[2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:19.080]  And she just got, her eyes got wide open and she says, really, I thought he was off the air.
[2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:21.080]  And I said, no.
[2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:24.080]  And I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go.
[2:30:25.080 --> 2:30:29.080]  She wrote down, you know, band.video and also infowords.com and just said she's still on.
[2:30:29.080 --> 2:30:35.080]  I run into people at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go, oh, Alex, I used to love you.
[2:30:36.080 --> 2:30:37.080]  I wish you were still on air. Are you ever going to go back on air?
[2:30:38.080 --> 2:30:40.080]  And I'm like, we're on hundreds of radio stations, over a hundred TV stations and cable stations.
[2:30:41.080 --> 2:30:43.080]  We have our own streams at infowords.com and band.video and they go, really?
[2:30:44.080 --> 2:30:48.080]  They said you were off the air because they took the platforming as off the air.
[2:30:49.080 --> 2:30:53.080]  No, we have our own platform info wars, info wars, info wars.
[2:30:53.080 --> 2:30:56.080]  Al killer in New Jersey. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:30:57.080 --> 2:30:59.080]  Alex. Hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[2:31:00.080 --> 2:31:02.080]  And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[2:31:03.080 --> 2:31:07.080]  So that's super blue, Florida free toothpaste and that super blue, whitening toothpaste is on another level.
[2:31:08.080 --> 2:31:12.080]  I use the one, I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:15.080]  It is by far the best product that I've ever used in my life.
[2:31:16.080 --> 2:31:18.080]  I literally just took a turbo course on my way to the gym right now.
[2:31:19.080 --> 2:31:20.080]  I've had a lot of fun.
[2:31:20.080 --> 2:31:22.080]  I literally just took a turbo course on my way to the gym right now.
[2:31:23.080 --> 2:31:30.080]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[2:31:31.080 --> 2:31:34.080]  So I just want to get that out of the way, support this man, everything that he exposed.
[2:31:35.080 --> 2:31:38.080]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove. Nobody knew about FD. Nobody knew about Build-A-Bird.
[2:31:39.080 --> 2:31:42.080]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001. Go look it up yourself.
[2:31:43.080 --> 2:31:46.080]  Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want us off the air without you or not here.
[2:31:46.080 --> 2:31:49.080]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[2:32:16.080 --> 2:32:17.080]  Thank you, sir.
[2:32:46.080 --> 2:33:01.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:16.080 --> 2:33:21.080]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[2:33:22.080 --> 2:33:25.080]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:33:26.080 --> 2:33:29.080]  I see your hair is burning.
[2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:33.080]  Chase the Patriot from California, you're on the air.
[2:33:34.080 --> 2:33:39.080]  Everybody's talking about the virus because it's definitely a big, giant, hyped event, whether it's real or not, whether it's super deadly or not.
[2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:42.080]  This is going to be crazy. What do you think is about to happen?
[2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:49.080]  Yeah, you know, obviously it's the real thing, but what the response is, that's the angles I've been trying to research.
[2:33:50.080 --> 2:33:51.080]  And there's a couple of questions I have.
[2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:59.080]  You know, one is the fact that over and over I see a trend that this may be the last straw that breaks the camel's back towards cash.
[2:34:00.080 --> 2:34:08.080]  There's been a war on cash, on physical money for years, and now because of people so fearful of handshake, any kind of exchange.
[2:34:08.080 --> 2:34:18.080]  This may be, and you see a trend in the news where they're saying Bitcoin is a way to invest because people trying to get their money out of China have to put it in the digital currency.
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:27.080]  You see the central banks, they're all going to meet in emergency meetings because they're saying they have an emergency, they have to handle together in a global way.
[2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:35.080]  And then finally you see they're actually quarantining the money that's coming from China, the physical money that's coming back into the United States.
[2:34:35.080 --> 2:34:38.080]  And so I see this trend of an attack on money.
[2:34:39.080 --> 2:34:40.080]  And here's one thing I got a question though, Alex.
[2:34:41.080 --> 2:34:53.080]  A lot of my callers, they've been calling in and they're asking about the Smith Month Modernization Act and when President Obama was allowing the propaganda to be put into just the general public.
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:55.080]  And now we see such a paranoia.
[2:34:56.080 --> 2:34:57.080]  People are confused.
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:34:59.080]  Nobody knows what to believe or where to look.
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:07.080]  And I really think that this is maybe that crisis that they're trying to use in the confusion to take away our rights for that tyrannical one-world government.
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:09.080]  I don't know, what do you think about that?
[2:35:10.080 --> 2:35:11.080]  Do you know anything about the Smith Month Act?
[2:35:12.080 --> 2:35:12.080]  Sure.
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:17.080]  And 10 years ago Obama got it legalized for the CIA to engage in propaganda domestically.
[2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:18.080]  It's just a shame.
[2:35:19.080 --> 2:35:21.080]  And again, it's not, I'm not defending the CIA when I say this.
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:23.080]  The CIA is just a government agency.
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:25.080]  It's like a glove.
[2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:32.080]  It's the globalist interests that are involved in the corporations and in the media and the CIA.
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:34.080]  It's the globalist.
[2:35:35.080 --> 2:35:36.080]  It's the New World Order people.
[2:35:37.080 --> 2:35:38.080]  They're the ones that are involved in all this.
[2:35:39.080 --> 2:35:40.080]  Douglas Shaffer is at your call today.
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:42.080]  She always brings up amazing points.
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:44.080]  Okay, let's go ahead now and take another call.
[2:35:46.080 --> 2:35:48.080]  Let's go to Robert in North Carolina.
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:50.080]  Welcome.
[2:35:51.080 --> 2:35:52.080]  Hey, Alex.
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:54.080]  Thanks for having me on.
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:35:57.080]  Hey, there's two things that I think us as Americans really need to do.
[2:35:58.080 --> 2:36:03.080]  One, I think we need a repent of our sins and pray the blood of Yeshua over us,
[2:36:04.080 --> 2:36:05.080]  because I think this is the big move.
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:07.080]  Oh, I mean, I agree.
[2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:09.080]  This is a spiritual battle.
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:11.080]  We better get close to God.
[2:36:12.080 --> 2:36:13.080]  Yeah, Satan is making his move right now.
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:15.080]  The other thing is I think we need a fast.
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:21.080]  And me personally, what I mean by fast is Mike Adams hit it on the head.
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:25.080]  He has got the spirit and he knows what needs to be done.
[2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:29.080]  We need to stop going out to dinner, stop going out to the ballpark,
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:34.080]  stop doing those things so that we can stop this virus that's coming.
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:41.080]  I mean, look at China, look at Italy, look at South Korea, look at Japan.
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:43.080]  Their houses are on fire.
[2:36:43.080 --> 2:36:47.080]  And what's not spreading fear, just like your analogies, you know,
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:51.080]  if your neighbor's house is on fire, you know, you love your neighbor,
[2:36:52.080 --> 2:36:54.080]  your Christian, you go over there and say, Hey, I see your back, your house is on fire.
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:56.080]  Can you help putting it out?
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:36:58.080]  You know, you love his children.
[2:36:59.080 --> 2:37:00.080]  You love your neighbor.
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:03.080]  Not only do you love them, but you love your own, you love yourself.
[2:37:04.080 --> 2:37:07.080]  So that fire is going to catch onto your house, too, if he doesn't put it out.
[2:37:07.080 --> 2:37:14.080]  I agree with what you're saying, but then it's the chai comms in South by Southwest
[2:37:15.080 --> 2:37:18.080]  and the Democrats and big tech saying this is the end of the world.
[2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:20.080]  They're the ones saying quarantine.
[2:37:21.080 --> 2:37:22.080]  They're the ones saying it's big, that it's real.
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:25.080]  And there's such liars that I go, well, maybe it isn't very big then.
[2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:28.080]  If you're such liars and you're saying Trump hasn't done something.
[2:37:29.080 --> 2:37:29.080]  I agree.
[2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:31.080]  Trump shouldn't be caught flat footed.
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:36.080]  You know, in case it really is super deadly, but it's a complex balancing act.
[2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:38.080]  What do you think Trump should do?
[2:37:39.080 --> 2:37:41.080]  I will just think what Satan is doing.
[2:37:42.080 --> 2:37:43.080]  Don't worry about Trump right now.
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:47.080]  Satan, it will tell you a lie, a lie, a lie, a lie, a lie.
[2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:49.080]  And then he'll slip in a truth.
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:51.080]  And that's the trick.
[2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:54.080]  My people will perish for lack of knowledge.
[2:37:55.080 --> 2:37:56.080]  And right now we need knowledge.
[2:37:57.080 --> 2:37:58.080]  We need scientists.
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:00.080]  We need Mike Adams.
[2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:02.080]  We need to know everything about this virus.
[2:38:03.080 --> 2:38:07.080]  Secondly, I think Trump, what I think Trump needs to do is he needs to stop saying this is a regular flu.
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:12.080]  He needs to stop saying don't wear masks because you don't get the virus through your hand.
[2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:14.080]  You get the virus through your nose, through your eyes and through your mouth.
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:18.080]  Let's be real sure he knows that it's an attempt to create panic.
[2:38:19.080 --> 2:38:21.080]  So he's kind of one dimensionally than saying, Hey, don't do that.
[2:38:22.080 --> 2:38:22.080]  I agree.
[2:38:23.080 --> 2:38:23.080]  He should be attacking the source of it.
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:24.080]  Who made it?
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:25.080]  Where did it come from?
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:28.080]  Why are the chai comms blaming us when they're the ones that first released it?
[2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:29.080]  Great points, Robert.
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:30.080]  Thank you so much.
[2:38:31.080 --> 2:38:33.080]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to the next caller in line here.
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:37.080]  And that would be so many callers.
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:38.080]  There's so many awesome callers.
[2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:40.080]  Jay in Seattle.
[2:38:41.080 --> 2:38:41.080]  Jay, thank you.
[2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:42.080]  You're on the air.
[2:38:43.080 --> 2:38:43.080]  Hey, Alex.
[2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:44.080]  Hey, I have a suggestion.
[2:38:45.080 --> 2:38:47.080]  I think we need to catch them not looking.
[2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:54.080]  Every time they do this, they crash the economy and then they buy everything up and then they shred spear and then they buy everything up.
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:56.080]  And I think they'd never see it coming.
[2:38:57.080 --> 2:38:57.080]  Exactly.
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:38:58.080]  You just said the key.
[2:38:59.080 --> 2:39:00.080]  The globalist engineer of the crisis like 2008.
[2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:05.080]  This is the new one to crash all your money you put in and they suck it back.
[2:39:06.080 --> 2:39:07.080]  And that's all this is.
[2:39:08.080 --> 2:39:14.080]  Well, and people haven't gone back in, you know, they've been trying to cope to everyone back into the market and all their wealth is in the market.
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:19.080]  And so they're willing to hurt themselves in order to hurt us so they can buy everything up.
[2:39:20.080 --> 2:39:27.080]  But if we just turn around and buy what we can afford, we'll buy all the shares of their companies at these depressed prices.
[2:39:28.080 --> 2:39:29.080]  Never have truer words been stated.
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:34.080]  You just see them riding the cycle and they release the virus and they hype it up.
[2:39:35.080 --> 2:39:35.080]  The question is how deadly is it?
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:37.080]  But it doesn't matter.
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:39.080]  The promotion of it is synthetic.
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:41.080]  It is a hoax.
[2:39:41.080 --> 2:39:42.080]  Right.
[2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:45.080]  And they just all they want is more power and more money.
[2:39:46.080 --> 2:39:47.080]  And they'd never, they never expect.
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:49.080]  Yeah, what good money if your kids are dead?
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:51.080]  I mean, it's like a certain point like.
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:40:00.080]  Yeah, I mean, it's no good if that kind of thing happens, but people need to know to buy the dip.
[2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:02.080]  And they've been ready for forever.
[2:40:03.080 --> 2:40:07.080]  Ray Dalio shorted the market like six months ago for this exact time period.
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:09.080]  No, I totally agree with you.
[2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:14.080]  I mean, I'm not a guy that gets to the market because I would obsess over it, but obviously you buy during a crash.
[2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:16.080]  That's that's that's that's what you do.
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:20.080]  But the general public, they buy at the high, they buy at the high.
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:21.080]  Right.
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:26.080]  Because they, they, they feel like they're going to miss out and everything goes up and they're making so much money.
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:29.080]  They wait till it's the sure thing instead of being the trailblazer.
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:31.080]  Right.
[2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:33.080]  And then all these people, their wealth is in the stock market.
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:38.080]  We could take their wealth from them by buying their shares when they depressed themselves.
[2:40:39.080 --> 2:40:40.080]  Very well said.
[2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:42.080]  What else do you think Trump should do?
[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:44.080]  I think you should come out and just be honest.
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:46.080]  Tell people to buy the dip.
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:49.080]  Tell people this is an opportunity like 2008 was.
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:51.080]  Tell people the truth about.
[2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:52.080]  Exactly.
[2:40:53.080 --> 2:40:55.080]  Instead of countering that, oh, the virus is in a big deal.
[2:40:55.080 --> 2:41:02.080]  So yeah, it may be really horrible, but uses an opportunity and then he's not afraid because him saying nothing's happening makes people afraid.
[2:41:03.080 --> 2:41:04.080]  Then you got to say, okay, maybe it's super deadly.
[2:41:05.080 --> 2:41:05.080]  We're Americans.
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:06.080]  We can handle it.
[2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:07.080]  Good God.
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:08.080]  There's nothing wrong with getting ready.
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:09.080]  Go to Costco.
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:11.080]  Get your stuff, you know, order from him.
[2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:13.080]  That's hedging a bet.
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:14.080]  Right.
[2:41:15.080 --> 2:41:17.080]  And then be honest and then just tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may.
[2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:18.080]  Exactly.
[2:41:19.080 --> 2:41:19.080]  That's what I do.
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:21.080]  My wife's like, we're buying all this food and extra stuff.
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:23.080]  You already have like an attic full of what he did.
[2:41:23.080 --> 2:41:24.080]  I said, those are great depression.
[2:41:25.080 --> 2:41:26.080]  I'm not worried about the virus.
[2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:28.080]  The virus may be super bad or maybe not.
[2:41:29.080 --> 2:41:31.080]  But if they get a depression going, we better have five years food sweetheart.
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:33.080]  I mean, you know,
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:37.080]  And then if it's not bad, then you can donate to the food bank or you can help your neighbors.
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:40.080]  If it is bad, you know, having, having extra supplies is always good.
[2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:47.080]  Well, that's the thing about buying high quality, swirable food bulk is that it's like five times cheaper than at a store because there's all the middle men.
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:52.080]  And like my patriot that we have that still has food takes them six to eight weeks to ship it, but they got the food.
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:54.080]  Everybody else is sold out.
[2:41:55.080 --> 2:41:56.080]  There's no middle men.
[2:41:57.080 --> 2:41:58.080]  So you're, you're literally getting high quality food.
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:00.080]  The lowest price you're going to find.
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:01.080]  All right, brother, I appreciate your call.
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:03.080]  Jay, amazing points.
[2:42:04.080 --> 2:42:08.080]  We've got, we've done a pretty good job taking calls today.
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:10.080]  I didn't give myself a B plus today.
[2:42:10.080 --> 2:42:16.080]  We've got Mr. Put.
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:18.080]  We're going to him next.
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:25.080]  And then we've got Kyle, Chris, JK, Benny, Elaine and Joe.
[2:42:26.080 --> 2:42:35.080]  And I will get to every one of those calls before Paul, Joseph Watson takes over in the fourth hour.
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:39.080]  And I have had no sleep in.

[2:43:58.080 --> 2:43:59.080]  I've tried turbo force with everything.
[2:44:00.080 --> 2:44:02.080]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[2:44:03.080 --> 2:44:04.080]  I put turbo force in my coffee.
[2:44:05.080 --> 2:44:05.080]  That was a crazy week.
[2:44:06.080 --> 2:44:07.080]  I don't, I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go,
[2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:11.080]  turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down to taking control of your life,
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:15.080]  taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[2:44:16.080 --> 2:44:19.080]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks,
[2:44:19.080 --> 2:44:21.080]  I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:22.080]  I'm going to wake up today.
[2:44:23.080 --> 2:44:23.080]  You know what?
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:27.080]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[2:44:28.080 --> 2:44:29.080]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:31.080]  I don't think that happens very often.
[2:44:32.080 --> 2:44:32.080]  It's never happened to me.
[2:44:33.080 --> 2:44:33.080]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[2:44:34.080 --> 2:44:34.080]  Tate, you're such a good guy.
[2:44:35.080 --> 2:44:36.080]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[2:44:37.080 --> 2:44:38.080]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me.
[2:44:39.080 --> 2:44:40.080]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:42.080]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.

[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:02.080]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[2:45:03.080 --> 2:45:03.080]  Yeah.
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:05.080]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.

[2:45:54.080 --> 2:46:03.080]  Six weeks ago, we warned you that the choreographed nature of the global media and governments concerning coronavirus told us it was a major globalist operation.
[2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:10.080]  Now, whether it's super deadly or not, the issue is it's being used by the globalist as a weapon against the world economy
[2:46:11.080 --> 2:46:15.080]  and against nation states and against the populist movement here in America and against info wars.
[2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:17.080]  And that means against you.

[2:47:17.080 --> 2:47:19.080]  I just got hired and kind of listen to that music.
[2:47:20.080 --> 2:47:22.080]  Jones, why are you so alive? What are you on?
[2:47:23.080 --> 2:47:27.080]  I'm on Jesus Christ, the ultimate drug.
[2:47:28.080 --> 2:47:35.080]  I'm on the Holy Spirit, not a spirit of weakness, but a spirit of victory.
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:44.080]  So awesome that this weak vessel cannot even begin to show you God's power.
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:51.080]  But nevertheless, through this little crack in the veil that is info wars, you can see the spirit.
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:55.080]  Back, can we just re-cue that music for a minute?
[2:47:56.080 --> 2:48:03.080]  Because there's a lot of music out there, but the way that synthesizer comes in and that rush song at the beginning of Tom Sawyer is so powerful.
[2:48:04.080 --> 2:48:05.080]  Can we cue that up?
[2:48:07.080 --> 2:48:09.080]  Like in heaven, you're supposed to just hear that over and over again.
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:15.080]  A Monday warrior, meet, meet, stride, today's Tom Sawyer, meet, meet, stride.
[2:48:16.080 --> 2:48:19.080]  Cue it one more time. Cue it back up. One more time.
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:22.080]  Something like that's going threes.
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:31.080]  A Monday warrior, meet, meet, stride, today's Tom Sawyer, meet, stride.
[2:48:32.080 --> 2:48:34.080]  I don't know about you, but I'm not worried about taking on the gloves.
[2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:39.080]  I just want to make sure when I'm climbing that hill that I've got all the strength I've got.
[2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:41.080]  I take every step just right.
[2:48:42.080 --> 2:48:43.080]  So I'm not too confident.
[2:48:44.080 --> 2:48:45.080]  So I get up there to the top of that hill.
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:47.080]  I get my hands around that little demon's neck.
[2:48:48.080 --> 2:48:51.080]  And I watch those lights go out and you know we beat them.
[2:48:56.080 --> 2:48:57.080]  Planning out the day's event.
[2:48:58.080 --> 2:48:59.080]  So we're going to take a lot of your phone calls here.
[2:48:59.080 --> 2:49:04.080]  You know, we're in fat time right now. We're in, you know, happy hunting time.
[2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:06.080]  Plenty of money coming into info wars.
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:09.080]  But then I look back on 26 years on air.
[2:49:10.080 --> 2:49:14.080]  Every time we're bringing in plenty of money to fund things, I stop plugging.
[2:49:16.080 --> 2:49:19.080]  And then the lean times come and I can't fund things about these projects.
[2:49:20.080 --> 2:49:24.080]  I want to launch. I have so many vicious projects and operations.
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:28.080]  I'm ready to launch so many diabolical plans.
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:30.080]  The left would see them as that.
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:32.080]  I mean, like I'm a super villain. I mean, we've got the haircut now,
[2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:35.080]  but only you funding us can do that.
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:37.080]  So I sort of thinking you're a dumbass Jones.
[2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:40.080]  You plug really hard when no money's coming in.
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:44.080]  And then when the big kahoon is coming in, you don't plug when you know damn well,
[2:49:45.080 --> 2:49:47.080]  you're going to use that money as a weapon against the globalist.
[2:49:48.080 --> 2:49:49.080]  So you need nano silver toothpaste.
[2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:51.080]  You need super silver.
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:55.080]  You need super blue. You need ultimate turmeric bodies back in stock.
[2:49:56.080 --> 2:50:00.080]  You need DNA for us to kill Q 10 and PQQ and so much more back in stock 40% off.
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:03.080]  You need ultra 12. You need vitamin refugia.
[2:50:04.080 --> 2:50:05.080]  You need turbo force now back in stock.
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:07.080]  You need all this. These are awesome products.
[2:50:08.080 --> 2:50:13.080]  Try them and experience it because you can't lose because you know info wars delivers in the fight.
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:19.080]  So if it was just a cardboard box, you were getting your funding info war.
[2:50:19.080 --> 2:50:21.080]  It's a win, but this is bad ass stuff.
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:26.080]  You think I'm going to produce a sweet pain that doesn't have the purest,
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:28.080]  most hardcore stuff in it.
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:37.080]  It's natural. You think I would put my name on something and screw you metaphysically knowing I'd be in the clown devil operation.
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:39.080]  If I did that, I actually get nervous.
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:42.080]  I'm not afraid of the globalist or I'm afraid of like not doing the very best for you.
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:45.080]  Are we sure it's the best?
[2:50:45.080 --> 2:50:55.080]  And I'm like running around constantly because I can't tell you something unless I absolutely know it's true because I'm the polar opposite of the liars.
[2:50:56.080 --> 2:50:59.080]  They told me today. They said, don't go on there and say you got pulled over for a DWI.
[2:51:00.080 --> 2:51:01.080]  Don't talk about that.
[2:51:02.080 --> 2:51:04.080]  When it says I got tested, it was below the legal limit.
[2:51:05.080 --> 2:51:07.080]  Like I told the cop, I did nothing wrong.
[2:51:08.080 --> 2:51:09.080]  I've been vindicated. Who cares?
[2:51:09.080 --> 2:51:14.080]  I'm not drag queen story, Trump, trying to stick my Johnson in your five year old.
[2:51:15.080 --> 2:51:17.080]  That's the issue, not me.
[2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:20.080]  And Lord knows I've got my problems.
[2:51:21.080 --> 2:51:23.080]  But I have reached the point of no return.
[2:51:24.080 --> 2:51:27.080]  I don't care about anybody but God.
[2:51:28.080 --> 2:51:30.080]  I don't care what they do to me.
[2:51:31.080 --> 2:51:32.080]  I don't care what you say about me.
[2:51:33.080 --> 2:51:34.080]  I don't care how you persecute me.
[2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:38.080]  I will never bow to your new world order.
[2:51:39.080 --> 2:51:40.080]  Burn in hell.
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:46.080]  And in that moment, you now touch the face of God.
[2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:51.080]  Because God wants people that aren't going to bow down in this test.
[2:51:52.080 --> 2:51:53.080]  This is baby stuff.
[2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:55.080]  This is elementary.
[2:51:56.080 --> 2:51:57.080]  We'll go to the next level.
[2:51:58.080 --> 2:51:59.080]  We'll look back.
[2:52:00.080 --> 2:52:02.080]  It's like babies with blocks and going kitty cat doggy.
[2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:05.080]  And God just wants people that aren't jollards.
[2:52:06.080 --> 2:52:07.080]  That's all.
[2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:09.080]  It's just a test.
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:11.080]  And I love life.
[2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:13.080]  I'm not scared of that though.
[2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:15.080]  I'm ready to get beamed up.
[2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:17.080]  I'll tell you that because I know it's real folks.
[2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:19.080]  I've seen the other side.
[2:52:20.080 --> 2:52:21.080]  I see across the valley anytime I want to.
[2:52:22.080 --> 2:52:23.080]  But let me tell you something right now.
[2:52:24.080 --> 2:52:25.080]  We're going to win because of you.
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:28.080]  And taking your kids to school and working hard and being a decent person
[2:52:29.080 --> 2:52:30.080]  and loving God's all you need to do.
[2:52:30.080 --> 2:52:31.080]  You need to be a decent person.
[2:52:32.080 --> 2:52:33.080]  Justice and just loving God.
[2:52:34.080 --> 2:52:35.080]  You do that.
[2:52:36.080 --> 2:52:37.080]  Everything else is handled.
[2:52:38.080 --> 2:52:39.080]  You love God.
[2:52:40.080 --> 2:52:41.080]  You want to be a good person.
[2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:43.080]  You just love God.
[2:52:44.080 --> 2:52:45.080]  It's that relationship.
[2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:47.080]  I love God.
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:49.080]  I love justice.
[2:52:50.080 --> 2:52:51.080]  That's all the wealth.
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:53.080]  It's all the power.
[2:52:54.080 --> 2:52:55.080]  You love God.
[2:52:56.080 --> 2:52:57.080]  You want to be a good person.
[2:52:57.080 --> 2:52:59.080]  And it's like a fire hose of power.
[2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:01.080]  You ever seen big dams?
[2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:03.080]  Gates open when there's a big flood.
[2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:05.080]  And it's just blasting out.
[2:53:06.080 --> 2:53:10.080]  God's looking for people that can handle that level of power
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:13.080]  and who don't use power to oppress people
[2:53:14.080 --> 2:53:16.080]  but use it to expand human consciousness.
[2:53:17.080 --> 2:53:19.080]  And the minute you enter into that gate,
[2:53:20.080 --> 2:53:21.080]  you are now in the presence of God.
[2:53:22.080 --> 2:53:23.080]  And you feel that presence.
[2:53:24.080 --> 2:53:25.080]  You don't fear the New World Order
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:26.080]  or all the slime bags
[2:53:27.080 --> 2:53:28.080]  or all the cowards anymore.
[2:53:29.080 --> 2:53:31.080]  You just want to be in alignment with God.
[2:53:33.080 --> 2:53:34.080]  But you look at the preachers.
[2:53:35.080 --> 2:53:37.080]  On average, they are a cultist
[2:53:38.080 --> 2:53:39.080]  or they're blackmailed or they're Satanist
[2:53:40.080 --> 2:53:41.080]  who have been sent to take over
[2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:43.080]  and they're going to tell you all day
[2:53:44.080 --> 2:53:45.080]  how good they are
[2:53:46.080 --> 2:53:47.080]  and how, oh, you like the woman.
[2:53:48.080 --> 2:53:49.080]  Oh, that's the devil.
[2:53:50.080 --> 2:53:52.080]  But they will never talk about the pedophiles.
[2:53:52.080 --> 2:53:55.080]  They'll never talk about because it's all a fraud.
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:53:57.080]  But this matter, you're winning,
[2:53:58.080 --> 2:53:59.080]  we're winning, they're losing
[2:54:00.080 --> 2:54:01.080]  and they know it and they can feel it
[2:54:02.080 --> 2:54:03.080]  and all their people that serve them.
[2:54:04.080 --> 2:54:05.080]  I don't say this with pleasure.
[2:54:06.080 --> 2:54:07.080]  If you're going to let this event,
[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:10.080]  they're dying without God.
[2:54:12.080 --> 2:54:13.080]  Those of us that have God
[2:54:14.080 --> 2:54:15.080]  are like bulging with energy and power.
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:17.080]  It's almost embarrassing.
[2:54:18.080 --> 2:54:19.080]  It's like, oh, hey, please, no, no, no, no, please.
[2:54:19.080 --> 2:54:21.080]  And meanwhile, you go look at some global,
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:23.080]  they're like a little zombie.
[2:54:25.080 --> 2:54:27.080]  Why would you want to be part of something
[2:54:28.080 --> 2:54:31.080]  that is such a giant galactic failure?
[2:54:34.080 --> 2:54:35.080]  Well, I'm ranting, aren't I?
[2:54:37.080 --> 2:54:38.080]  It is a vice I have.
[2:54:39.080 --> 2:54:40.080]  Benny in Tennessee.
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:42.080]  Oh, no, Mr. Putt first.
[2:54:43.080 --> 2:54:45.080]  Mr. Putt wants to know about an infected at CPAC.
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:47.080]  Mr. Putt, what do you think is going on?
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:49.080]  The president may have been infected.
[2:54:50.080 --> 2:54:51.080]  The CHICOM showed me about the fear.
[2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:53.080]  What should I do?
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:55.080]  Well, Alex, I'm curious if,
[2:54:56.080 --> 2:54:57.080]  if you're wondering if you're infected
[2:54:58.080 --> 2:54:59.080]  because your reporter, Millie Weaver,
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:02.080]  she's got a photo here on her Twitter page
[2:55:03.080 --> 2:55:04.080]  with Diamond and Silk.
[2:55:05.080 --> 2:55:06.080]  I am infected.
[2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:08.080]  I'm infected.
[2:55:09.080 --> 2:55:10.080]  Oh, okay.
[2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:12.080]  I'm infected.
[2:55:12.080 --> 2:55:13.080]  Oh, okay.
[2:55:14.080 --> 2:55:16.080]  I'm infected with something called 1776.
[2:55:17.080 --> 2:55:18.080]  Have you heard about it?
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:20.080]  Well, yeah.
[2:55:21.080 --> 2:55:22.080]  But anyway.
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:24.080]  No, seriously.
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:25.080]  So wait a minute.
[2:55:25.080 --> 2:55:26.080]  Wait a minute.
[2:55:26.080 --> 2:55:27.080]  You see Diamond and Silk talk to somebody
[2:55:27.080 --> 2:55:29.080]  who talked to somebody that saw a leprechaun.
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:31.080]  And then now it's like,
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:34.080]  I'm infected.
[2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:35.080]  What should I do?
[2:55:36.080 --> 2:55:37.080]  Should I bow to G.G.P.?
[2:55:38.080 --> 2:55:39.080]  Oh, G.G.P.?
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:41.080]  What?
[2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:42.080]  I'm not being mean, Mr. Put.
[2:55:43.080 --> 2:55:44.080]  How do I properly bow?
[2:55:46.080 --> 2:55:47.080]  How do I lay on my belly before G.G.P.?
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:49.080]  Tell me how I do that.
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:53.080]  Oh, uh, you're, you're being silly.
[2:55:54.080 --> 2:55:55.080]  No, no, no, no, no.
[2:55:55.080 --> 2:55:56.080]  You just called in and said,
[2:55:57.080 --> 2:55:58.080]  I see it on the board.
[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:00.080]  Is that Alex and M4's crew infected with coronavirus?
[2:56:01.080 --> 2:56:02.080]  That is a luscious headline.
[2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:03.080]  We're going to go to that line, actually.
[2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:06.080]  R is Alex Jones infected with coronavirus?
[2:56:08.080 --> 2:56:09.080]  Yeah, I'm wondering.
[2:56:09.080 --> 2:56:10.080]  Oh my God.
[2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:11.080]  And so what does it say?
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:12.080]  Powered of G.G.P.?
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:16.080]  No, um, that's a concern for your health.
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:18.080]  Tell me about G.G.P.
[2:56:18.080 --> 2:56:19.080]  and how handsome he is.
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:22.080]  People should be concerned generally for your health
[2:56:23.080 --> 2:56:24.080]  based on the, uh,
[2:56:25.080 --> 2:56:26.080]  based on the crazy things you say.
[2:56:27.080 --> 2:56:29.080]  Based on the amount of
[2:56:31.080 --> 2:56:32.080]  goblin powerhouse?
[2:56:34.080 --> 2:56:35.080]  Oh, you're being silly again.
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:37.080]  All right.
[2:56:37.080 --> 2:56:40.080]  You called in because this is the big magic leftist thing.
[2:56:41.080 --> 2:56:42.080]  Virus.
[2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:44.080]  Oh, someone at Westlake in Austin
[2:56:45.080 --> 2:56:48.080]  saw someone who knew someone who talked to somebody
[2:56:49.080 --> 2:56:51.080]  who was an uncle of a brother of a sister of a cousin
[2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:54.080]  who knew someone in another country who had the corona.
[2:56:55.080 --> 2:56:56.080]  And it's like a new role.
[2:56:56.080 --> 2:56:57.080]  They're like, I may have coronavirus.
[2:56:58.080 --> 2:57:01.080]  I just float down like, I am your coronavirus map.
[2:57:02.080 --> 2:57:04.080]  You know, I'm getting ready to come out for the coronavirus.
[2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:05.080]  This is John Huggs.
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:10.080]  It is, is, um, uh, is the coronavirus not highly infectious?
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:13.080]  Highly infectious.
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:16.080]  Uh, the child comes to tell us so, but, but, but, I mean,
[2:57:17.080 --> 2:57:18.080]  the death rate is, uh, been undocumented.
[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:20.080]  It gets lower and lower.
[2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:22.080]  15%, 2%, 1%.
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:24.080]  I believe the hype of the coronavirus is very real.
[2:57:25.080 --> 2:57:26.080]  It's a globalist move.
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:29.080]  I just don't know how we called in and go, Alex,
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:31.080]  you've been infected.
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:33.080]  Sorry.
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:36.080]  If you know what she does at info wars.com, you know,
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:39.080]  because if you go there, you become the name of the pool,
[2:57:40.080 --> 2:57:41.080]  like ZZP.
[2:57:43.080 --> 2:57:44.080]  If you understand why the globalist,
[2:57:45.080 --> 2:57:47.080]  why the servants of Satan hate info wars,
[2:57:48.080 --> 2:57:51.080]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate,
[2:57:52.080 --> 2:57:53.080]  and we're not giving up.
[2:57:54.080 --> 2:57:57.080]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:01.080]  of the new order's plans to not get down when they attack us
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:03.080]  and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[2:58:04.080 --> 2:58:08.080]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[2:58:09.080 --> 2:58:11.080]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side
[2:58:12.080 --> 2:58:14.080]  and they do what they do because they're slaves,
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:17.080]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress
[2:58:18.080 --> 2:58:19.080]  and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:24.080]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves,
[2:58:25.080 --> 2:58:29.080]  but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:32.080]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[2:58:33.080 --> 2:58:35.080]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[2:58:36.080 --> 2:58:38.080]  They fear the fact that we love God
[2:58:39.080 --> 2:58:42.080]  and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[2:58:44.080 --> 2:58:48.080]  I always promote DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10
[2:58:49.080 --> 2:58:51.080]  that cleans out the cells and empowers the telomeres
[2:58:52.080 --> 2:58:53.080]  and the mitochondria.
[2:58:54.080 --> 2:58:56.080]  It's the most powerful formula out there sold over the counter
[2:58:56.080 --> 2:58:58.080]  that is known to energize the body.
[2:58:59.080 --> 2:59:00.080]  I'm not going to jack up prices during crisis,
[2:59:01.080 --> 2:59:02.080]  but I am going to end up running out.
[2:59:03.080 --> 2:59:04.080]  So, fund the M4, boost your immune system

[2:59:43.080 --> 2:59:48.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:13.080 --> 3:00:14.080]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[3:00:15.080 --> 3:00:16.080]  Hit me with the power of Benny.
[3:00:17.080 --> 3:00:19.080]  I just want to say that the timing of the coronavirus
[3:00:20.080 --> 3:00:21.080]  is very suspect.
[3:00:22.080 --> 3:00:23.080]  If you look at what China was able to successfully do
[3:00:24.080 --> 3:00:25.080]  and what they did to the coronavirus,
[3:00:26.080 --> 3:00:27.080]  they're going to get a lot of people
[3:00:28.080 --> 3:00:29.080]  who are going to be able to get to the coronavirus.
[3:00:30.080 --> 3:00:31.080]  And I think that's a good thing.
[3:00:32.080 --> 3:00:33.080]  It's a good thing that they're able to get to the coronavirus
[3:00:34.080 --> 3:00:35.080]  and get to the coronavirus.
[3:00:36.080 --> 3:00:37.080]  And I think that's the biggest thing
[3:00:38.080 --> 3:00:39.080]  that they're going to be able to do.
[3:00:40.080 --> 3:00:41.080]  I think it's a good thing that they're going to be able
[3:00:41.080 --> 3:00:42.080]  to get to the coronavirus.
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:44.080]  I think it's a good thing that they're going to be able
[3:00:45.080 --> 3:00:46.080]  to get to the coronavirus.
[3:00:47.080 --> 3:00:48.080]  I think it's a good thing that China was able
[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:50.080]  to successfully do with quelling their freedom
[3:00:51.080 --> 3:00:52.080]  uprising.
[3:00:53.080 --> 3:00:54.080]  Are you saying a plastic banana's fake?
[3:00:55.080 --> 3:00:56.080]  Yes, the whole thing's been organized by them.
[3:00:57.080 --> 3:00:58.080]  The question is how deadly is the virus?
[3:00:59.080 --> 3:01:00.080]  We know the hype's weaponized.
[3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:02.080]  We know the global's behind it.
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:04.080]  But how deadly do you think the virus is, Benny?
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:06.080]  I don't think it's that deadly.
[3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:08.080]  I think that the way what they're doing
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:10.080]  fear and panic as a means to do that,
[3:01:11.080 --> 3:01:12.080]  the quarantine in the United States,
[3:01:13.080 --> 3:01:14.080]  I believe, is a big problem.
[3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:16.080]  I agree.
[3:01:17.080 --> 3:01:18.080]  They want to lock down the United States
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:20.080]  and they'll use that crisis to run around
[3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:22.080]  and fire bomb stuff with lots of little,
[3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:24.080]  little method, anti-for-people.
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:26.080]  Yeah, like the previous caller.
[3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:28.080]  But I think that the medical,
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:33.080]  I think that the medical martial law,
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:36.080]  the timing of that would align pretty well
[3:01:36.080 --> 3:01:37.080]  with the upcoming election.
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:39.080]  Oh, you're right.
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:41.080]  This whole thing is a totally the next globalist move.
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:44.080]  How do we take down the jabber walkie
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:46.080]  that went floofal as it went?
[3:01:47.080 --> 3:01:48.080]  How do we deal with that?
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:50.080]  Burbled as it went.
[3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:53.080]  Yeah, I think you got to get the supplements.
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:01:55.080]  You got to strengthen your own immune system.
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:01:58.080]  You got to not pay attention to the distractions.
[3:01:59.080 --> 3:02:00.080]  Get right with God.
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:02.080]  Get right with your family.
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:04.080]  And not let anything,
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:05.080]  you know, scare you into living your life.
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:07.080]  You know, I mean...
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:09.080]  Beautifully said, Betty.
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:11.080]  I got to talk to you for 10 hours,
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:13.080]  but I'm going to get the next person's thinking on.
[3:02:14.080 --> 3:02:16.080]  Elaine in the beautiful state of Maine,
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:18.080]  which is evil in America even exists.
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:20.080]  There's even a state.
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:22.080]  I apologize that she even exists.
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:24.080]  In fact, she is a bad, I'm sorry, it is calling.
[3:02:25.080 --> 3:02:26.080]  Elaine, thank you for calling.
[3:02:27.080 --> 3:02:28.080]  We've got about two minutes.
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:30.080]  Go ahead.
[3:02:31.080 --> 3:02:32.080]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:34.080]  I'm a long time listener and customer
[3:02:35.080 --> 3:02:36.080]  and new world order fighter.
[3:02:38.080 --> 3:02:39.080]  And so I want to call in about
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:42.080]  what happened to me, a personal experience anyway.
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:45.080]  Back in October,
[3:02:46.080 --> 3:02:47.080]  first of October, I came down with
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:50.080]  something that, you know,
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:53.080]  I've never even come close to having before.
[3:02:54.080 --> 3:02:58.080]  And I believe now it was the virus.
[3:02:58.080 --> 3:02:59.080]  Well, the good news is your body
[3:03:00.080 --> 3:03:01.080]  thinks the good Lord defeated it.
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:03.080]  And it wasn't just me that got it.
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:05.080]  I'm in my sixties, you know,
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:07.080]  and it wasn't just me,
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:10.080]  my son who came over to help me out
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:12.080]  a little bit when I was sick.
[3:03:13.080 --> 3:03:14.080]  Wow.
[3:03:15.080 --> 3:03:16.080]  In the beginning, he's half my age
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:18.080]  and he came down with it.
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:20.080]  There's a lot of really rough stuff.
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:22.080]  Yeah, that's what Steve Pachettic says.
[3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:24.080]  He says the virus has been there for six months.
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:26.080]  It's raging out of control.
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:28.080]  That's why they put the final test kits
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:30.080]  out that Bill Gates is sending out
[3:03:31.080 --> 3:03:32.080]  to create hysteria.
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:34.080]  Well, actually, actually,
[3:03:35.080 --> 3:03:38.080]  I had it the year before in 2018.
[3:03:39.080 --> 3:03:42.080]  And both times, last year and 2018,
[3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:44.080]  I had it in October.
[3:03:45.080 --> 3:03:47.080]  And I'm, you know,
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:50.080]  I follow your show.
[3:03:51.080 --> 3:03:52.080]  I follow all the news and everything.
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:03:55.080]  And I...
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:03:57.080]  Ma'am, don't you want to
[3:03:58.080 --> 3:03:59.080]  trust the little demon elf?
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:01.080]  Like, when you meet Satan,
[3:04:02.080 --> 3:04:03.080]  it looks like Bill Gates,
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:05.080]  because that is Satan.
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:07.080]  I mean, just look at that photo
[3:04:08.080 --> 3:04:09.080]  if you're watching on TV.
[3:04:10.080 --> 3:04:11.080]  That's a helper right there.
[3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:13.080]  I mean, obviously, he's here to help you.
[3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:16.080]  The only thing I can think of is
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:18.080]  I might have contacted it
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:20.080]  from a restaurant.
[3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:23.080]  That I went to that has
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:26.080]  a Chinese restaurant, actually,
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:30.080]  that they have Chinese people
[3:04:31.080 --> 3:04:32.080]  over from China on visas.
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:35.080]  And the owner,
[3:04:36.080 --> 3:04:37.080]  one of them, the owner goes over there.
[3:04:38.080 --> 3:04:39.080]  That's the only thing I can think of.
[3:04:41.080 --> 3:04:43.080]  Ma'am, we appreciate you from Maine.
[3:04:44.080 --> 3:04:45.080]  Elaine, great call.
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:48.080]  All right, Rob and Chris and Kyle
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:50.080]  and Joe and Waylon,
[3:04:50.080 --> 3:05:19.080]  lot of cool names.
[3:05:20.080 --> 3:05:21.080]  We'll see you in the next one.
[3:05:50.080 --> 3:05:51.080]  Brought to you by you.
[3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:22.080]  And we are live here on 4th hour of the show.
[3:06:23.080 --> 3:06:24.080]  And guess what we're going to be talking about?
[3:06:25.080 --> 3:06:26.080]  Yes, we're going to be talking about
[3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:28.080]  surprise, surprise coronavirus.
[3:06:29.080 --> 3:06:30.080]  But maybe from a different angle,
[3:06:31.080 --> 3:06:32.080]  maybe looking at it from the angle
[3:06:33.080 --> 3:06:34.080]  of South Korea and Singapore
[3:06:35.080 --> 3:06:36.080]  and what they've done
[3:06:37.080 --> 3:06:38.080]  to mitigate the spread of coronavirus.
[3:06:39.080 --> 3:06:40.080]  Because if you look at the numbers
[3:06:41.080 --> 3:06:42.080]  out of those two countries
[3:06:43.080 --> 3:06:44.080]  and indeed out of China,
[3:06:45.080 --> 3:06:46.080]  if we are to believe that China is telling the truth,
[3:06:47.080 --> 3:06:48.080]  of course, you'd expect Singapore
[3:06:48.080 --> 3:06:49.080]  to be more honest.
[3:06:50.080 --> 3:06:52.080]  It does look like this could be
[3:06:53.080 --> 3:06:54.080]  a massive hysterical panic
[3:06:55.080 --> 3:06:56.080]  that is being sold.
[3:06:57.080 --> 3:06:58.080]  As the MIT scientists said,
[3:06:59.080 --> 3:07:00.080]  who was on Alex's show recently
[3:07:01.080 --> 3:07:02.080]  to manipulate financial markets
[3:07:03.080 --> 3:07:04.080]  and to sink the reelection of Donald Trump.
[3:07:05.080 --> 3:07:07.080]  We have an article up here on Summit.News.
[3:07:08.080 --> 3:07:09.080]  Singapore and South Korea numbers
[3:07:10.080 --> 3:07:12.080]  suggest coronavirus can be controlled.
[3:07:13.080 --> 3:07:14.080]  And there's a graph in there
[3:07:14.080 --> 3:07:16.080]  which shows the daily new cases
[3:07:17.080 --> 3:07:18.080]  of coronavirus infections
[3:07:19.080 --> 3:07:20.080]  out of South Korea.
[3:07:21.080 --> 3:07:23.080]  And if you look at it over the past three days,
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:25.080]  and this is what I point out in the article,
[3:07:26.080 --> 3:07:27.080]  by the way, the country's health minister
[3:07:28.080 --> 3:07:29.080]  in South Korea is now saying,
[3:07:30.080 --> 3:07:31.080]  they've, quote, passed the peak
[3:07:32.080 --> 3:07:33.080]  of coronavirus infections
[3:07:34.080 --> 3:07:35.080]  and are now seeing a decline in cases.
[3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:37.080]  They had a massive response to it.
[3:07:38.080 --> 3:07:39.080]  They had gigantic testing,
[3:07:40.080 --> 3:07:41.080]  probably the biggest testing
[3:07:41.080 --> 3:07:43.080]  of potential coronavirus victims
[3:07:44.080 --> 3:07:45.080]  in the entire world, bar China.
[3:07:47.080 --> 3:07:48.080]  They had 50 deaths,
[3:07:49.080 --> 3:07:50.080]  but now the coronavirus cases
[3:07:51.080 --> 3:07:52.080]  are seemingly under decline.
[3:07:53.080 --> 3:07:54.080]  March 7th,
[3:07:55.080 --> 3:07:56.080]  South Korea had 448
[3:07:57.080 --> 3:07:58.080]  new recorded cases of coronavirus.
[3:07:59.080 --> 3:08:01.080]  On March 8th, it was 272.
[3:08:02.080 --> 3:08:04.080]  And on March 9th yesterday,
[3:08:05.080 --> 3:08:06.080]  it was 165.
[3:08:07.080 --> 3:08:09.080]  Still waiting for the figures from today.
[3:08:09.080 --> 3:08:11.080]  But that suggests that in South Korea,
[3:08:12.080 --> 3:08:13.080]  it peaked towards the end of February,
[3:08:14.080 --> 3:08:15.080]  early March,
[3:08:16.080 --> 3:08:17.080]  and has been on the decline ever since.
[3:08:18.080 --> 3:08:19.080]  And again, this is a country
[3:08:20.080 --> 3:08:21.080]  that's carried out rigorous testing
[3:08:22.080 --> 3:08:23.080]  of potential coronavirus victims.
[3:08:24.080 --> 3:08:25.080]  So the argument that they're fudging
[3:08:26.080 --> 3:08:27.080]  the numbers or hiding the numbers
[3:08:28.080 --> 3:08:29.080]  or they haven't been able to test
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:31.080]  enough people doesn't really seem
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:33.080]  to hold weight.
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:35.080]  Similar story in Singapore.
[3:08:35.080 --> 3:08:37.080]  The World Health Organization,
[3:08:38.080 --> 3:08:39.080]  in between lambasting people
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:41.080]  for calling it the Wuhan virus,
[3:08:42.080 --> 3:08:43.080]  because that's now racist, you can't do that.
[3:08:44.080 --> 3:08:45.080]  In between lambasting people
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:47.080]  for stigmatizing the Chinese,
[3:08:48.080 --> 3:08:49.080]  because of course they literally came out
[3:08:50.080 --> 3:08:51.080]  five times and gave five different statements
[3:08:52.080 --> 3:08:53.080]  saying, it's important how we talk
[3:08:54.080 --> 3:08:55.080]  about this.
[3:08:56.080 --> 3:08:57.080]  Well, they've praised Singapore
[3:08:58.080 --> 3:08:59.080]  over and over again,
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:01.080]  not for them using politically correct
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:03.080]  language, but for their response
[3:09:03.080 --> 3:09:04.080]  to the coronavirus,
[3:09:05.080 --> 3:09:06.080]  because as this article points out,
[3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:08.080]  despite the country recording
[3:09:09.080 --> 3:09:10.080]  160 cases,
[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:12.080]  there have been zero deaths
[3:09:13.080 --> 3:09:14.080]  and 93 victims have already been
[3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:16.080]  discharged.
[3:09:17.080 --> 3:09:18.080]  And again, just like in South Korea,
[3:09:19.080 --> 3:09:20.080]  new cases of coronavirus in Singapore
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:22.080]  are on the decline.
[3:09:23.080 --> 3:09:24.080]  And you look at China,
[3:09:25.080 --> 3:09:26.080]  now we had today
[3:09:28.080 --> 3:09:29.080]  only 17, or in fact yesterday,
[3:09:30.080 --> 3:09:31.080]  only 17 new cases of coronavirus
[3:09:31.080 --> 3:09:32.080]  in Wuhan yesterday.
[3:09:33.080 --> 3:09:34.080]  Or in fact, no, that's today's numbers
[3:09:35.080 --> 3:09:36.080]  Tuesday, which is the lowest figure
[3:09:37.080 --> 3:09:38.080]  since China began publishing data.
[3:09:39.080 --> 3:09:40.080]  Can you trust the Communist Party
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:42.080]  of China's figures?
[3:09:43.080 --> 3:09:44.080]  Probably not.
[3:09:45.080 --> 3:09:46.080]  But going on what they've said,
[3:09:47.080 --> 3:09:48.080]  and AFP is reporting this as well,
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:50.080]  they're saying that in China,
[3:09:51.080 --> 3:09:52.080]  the tide has turned.
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:54.080]  President Xi Jinping saying the tide
[3:09:55.080 --> 3:09:56.080]  has turned AFP reporting
[3:09:57.080 --> 3:09:58.080]  new infections, quote, dropping
[3:09:58.080 --> 3:10:00.080]  dramatically in recent weeks.
[3:10:01.080 --> 3:10:02.080]  Of course, we've been told here in
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:04.080]  the West for days and in fact
[3:10:05.080 --> 3:10:06.080]  weeks on end that there are going
[3:10:07.080 --> 3:10:08.080]  to be thousands, potentially
[3:10:08.080 --> 3:10:09.080]  hundreds of thousands of
[3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:11.080]  coronavirus cases.
[3:10:12.080 --> 3:10:13.080]  But in those three countries,
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:15.080]  it seems like a corner has been
[3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:17.080]  turned.
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:19.080]  State media claiming the last of
[3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:21.080]  Wuhan's 16 makeshift hospitals,
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:23.080]  remember those new hospitals that
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:25.080]  they set up in a matter of days.
[3:10:25.080 --> 3:10:27.080]  The last hospital out of 16 in
[3:10:28.080 --> 3:10:29.080]  Wuhan has now been closed.
[3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:31.080]  And if that is the case,
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:33.080]  that does suggest that finally
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:35.080]  China is telling the truth
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:37.080]  and that draconian martial law
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:39.080]  quarantine measures did in fact
[3:10:40.080 --> 3:10:41.080]  work and coronavirus is at least
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:43.080]  for now on the decline.
[3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:45.080]  We're going to get into a story
[3:10:46.080 --> 3:10:47.080]  about how some people expect it
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:49.080]  to come roaring back in winter
[3:10:50.080 --> 3:10:51.080]  and they say it's going to be even
[3:10:52.080 --> 3:10:53.080]  worse in winter because there's a
[3:10:53.080 --> 3:10:54.080]  lot that suggests that it can't
[3:10:55.080 --> 3:10:56.080]  survive very well in warmer
[3:10:57.080 --> 3:10:58.080]  temperatures as we move towards
[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:00.080]  spring and summer.
[3:11:01.080 --> 3:11:02.080]  But certainly in these three
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:04.080]  countries and it's not just by the
[3:11:05.080 --> 3:11:06.080]  way the Communist Party of China
[3:11:07.080 --> 3:11:08.080]  saying it, we have a quote here
[3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:10.080]  from Alfred Wu, who is an
[3:11:11.080 --> 3:11:12.080]  associate professor at the
[3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:14.080]  National University of Singapore's
[3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:16.080]  Lee Kuan Yew School of Public
[3:11:17.080 --> 3:11:18.080]  Policy. He said, quote, the
[3:11:19.080 --> 3:11:20.080]  outbreak has basically ended in
[3:11:20.080 --> 3:11:22.080]  October. And as I write in the
[3:11:23.080 --> 3:11:24.080]  article, these numbers won't
[3:11:25.080 --> 3:11:26.080]  provide much comfort to Italy,
[3:11:27.080 --> 3:11:28.080]  which has now gone under a total
[3:11:29.080 --> 3:11:30.080]  quarantine. We're going to get
[3:11:31.080 --> 3:11:32.080]  onto that here in a moment.
[3:11:33.080 --> 3:11:34.080]  And then we're going to talk about
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:36.080]  Russia. In fact, I'm going to get
[3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:38.080]  into Russia in the next segment
[3:11:39.080 --> 3:11:40.080]  because Russia is an example,
[3:11:41.080 --> 3:11:42.080]  as with Mongolia, as with some of
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:44.080]  these other countries that closed
[3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:46.080]  most of their border very
[3:11:47.080 --> 3:11:48.080]  early. We're talking back towards
[3:11:48.080 --> 3:11:50.080]  than any other European, major
[3:11:51.080 --> 3:11:53.080]  European country in the case of
[3:11:54.080 --> 3:11:56.080]  Russia with just 20 recorded
[3:11:57.080 --> 3:11:58.080]  coronavirus cases as of yesterday
[3:11:59.080 --> 3:12:00.080]  in Russia and zero deaths.
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:02.080]  But is it a hysteria being
[3:12:04.080 --> 3:12:05.080]  ginned up politically to try and
[3:12:06.080 --> 3:12:07.080]  take down Trump in the 2020
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:09.080]  re-election? Well, that's
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:11.080]  certainly what an MIT scientist
[3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:13.080]  who I believe he was on Alex's
[3:12:14.080 --> 3:12:15.080]  show back a few days ago has said,
[3:12:15.080 --> 3:12:17.080]  I think the president's
[3:12:18.080 --> 3:12:19.080]  headline MIT scientist claims
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:21.080]  coronavirus is a quote deep
[3:12:22.080 --> 3:12:23.080]  state fraud. This is Shiva
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:25.080]  Ayadourai, who claims to be the
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:27.080]  inventor of email. He's a Ph.D.
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:29.080]  in biological engineering at MIT.
[3:12:30.080 --> 3:12:31.080]  Oh, that's what his Ph.D.
[3:12:32.080 --> 3:12:33.080]  was in. He's running as a
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:35.080]  Republican in the 2020 U.S.
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:37.080]  Senate race. He responded to
[3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:39.080]  President Donald Trump's claim
[3:12:40.080 --> 3:12:41.080]  that Democrats in the media are
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:43.080]  responsible for inflaming the
[3:12:43.080 --> 3:12:44.080]  president by saying that the
[3:12:45.080 --> 3:12:46.080]  panic has been overblown for
[3:12:47.080 --> 3:12:48.080]  political and economic reasons.
[3:12:49.080 --> 3:12:50.080]  He tweeted this quote as an MIT
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:52.080]  Ph.D. in biological engineering
[3:12:53.080 --> 3:12:54.080]  who studies and does research
[3:12:55.080 --> 3:12:56.080]  nearly every day on the immune
[3:12:57.080 --> 3:12:58.080]  system. He's an expert in the
[3:12:59.080 --> 3:13:00.080]  matter. The coronavirus fear
[3:13:01.080 --> 3:13:02.080]  mongering by the deep state will
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:04.080]  go down in history as one of the
[3:13:05.080 --> 3:13:06.080]  biggest frauds to manipulate
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:08.080]  economies, suppress, dissent
[3:13:09.080 --> 3:13:10.080]  and push mandated medicine,
[3:13:10.080 --> 3:13:12.080]  of course, in light of that
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:14.080]  potential coronavirus vaccine
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:16.080]  coming out at some point later
[3:13:17.080 --> 3:13:18.080]  this year. As a point out in
[3:13:19.080 --> 3:13:20.080]  the article, we don't really
[3:13:21.080 --> 3:13:22.080]  know about the full scale of it
[3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:24.080]  in the U.S. because about 6,000,
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:26.080]  only 6,000 people have been
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:28.080]  tested in the U.S. for the
[3:13:29.080 --> 3:13:30.080]  coronavirus. In fact, Rahim
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:32.080]  Kasam, who has been on this show
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:34.080]  before, of course, went to CPAC,
[3:13:35.080 --> 3:13:36.080]  was around the same room in
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:38.080]  which that individual at CPAC,
[3:13:38.080 --> 3:13:39.080]  conference a couple of weekends
[3:13:40.080 --> 3:13:41.080]  ago contracted coronavirus.
[3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:43.080]  He documented how he tried to
[3:13:44.080 --> 3:13:45.080]  get a test in the U.S., tried
[3:13:46.080 --> 3:13:47.080]  to go to a hospital to get a test
[3:13:48.080 --> 3:13:49.080]  and it was basically like
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:51.080]  wading through treacle. He
[3:13:52.080 --> 3:13:53.080]  finally got the test today and
[3:13:54.080 --> 3:13:55.080]  they've told him that it's going
[3:13:56.080 --> 3:13:57.080]  to be 72 hours before he gets
[3:13:58.080 --> 3:13:59.080]  the results. So certainly the
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:01.080]  accusation that the tests have
[3:14:02.080 --> 3:14:03.080]  not been forthcoming seems
[3:14:04.080 --> 3:14:05.080]  to be dead on, but of course
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:07.080]  some people are blaming that on
[3:14:08.080 --> 3:14:09.080]  the CDC, not Trump himself.
[3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:11.080]  So we've got a big MIT
[3:14:12.080 --> 3:14:13.080]  scientist saying that it's
[3:14:14.080 --> 3:14:15.080]  completely overblown. We've
[3:14:16.080 --> 3:14:17.080]  got South Korea having tested
[3:14:18.080 --> 3:14:19.080]  at least 100,000 people
[3:14:21.080 --> 3:14:22.080]  now basically have fought off
[3:14:23.080 --> 3:14:24.080]  the virus, but then across Europe
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:26.080]  of course we've got massively
[3:14:27.080 --> 3:14:28.080]  porous borders. Italy has
[3:14:29.080 --> 3:14:30.080]  recorded a thousand plus new
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:32.080]  coronavirus cases every single
[3:14:32.080 --> 3:14:34.080]  week. And of course they've had
[3:14:35.080 --> 3:14:36.080]  to quarantine and lock down
[3:14:37.080 --> 3:14:38.080]  their entire country.
[3:14:39.080 --> 3:14:40.080]  You're not contrast with that
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:42.080]  with how Russia responded in the
[3:14:43.080 --> 3:14:44.080]  next segment, but of course
[3:14:45.080 --> 3:14:46.080]  we continue to see price gouging
[3:14:47.080 --> 3:14:48.080]  headline up on some news NYC
[3:14:49.080 --> 3:14:50.080]  hardware store selling hand
[3:14:51.080 --> 3:14:52.080]  sanitizer for $109 a bottle.
[3:14:53.080 --> 3:14:55.080]  If the stuff hits the fan, you're
[3:14:56.080 --> 3:14:57.080]  not going to be able to eat
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:14:59.080]  hand sanitizer. We've seen
[3:14:59.080 --> 3:15:01.080]  a lot of the UK out of New Zealand,
[3:15:02.080 --> 3:15:03.080]  all these other countries, people
[3:15:04.080 --> 3:15:05.080]  squabbling over toilet roll
[3:15:06.080 --> 3:15:07.080]  will now in yet another shameless
[3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:09.080]  act of price gouging.
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:11.080]  A hardware store in New York is
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:13.080]  selling bottles of hand sanitizer
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:15.080]  for $109 a pot.
[3:15:17.080 --> 3:15:18.080]  They're actually selling one at
[3:15:19.080 --> 3:15:20.080]  $79 a pot. That's still available.
[3:15:21.080 --> 3:15:22.080]  The one for $109 has now gone out
[3:15:23.080 --> 3:15:24.080]  of stock. The shocking prices
[3:15:25.080 --> 3:15:26.080]  are not deterring customers.
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:28.080]  We've seen a lot of people
[3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:30.080]  squabbling over the shelf and the
[3:15:31.080 --> 3:15:32.080]  bigger bottles have sold out.
[3:15:33.080 --> 3:15:34.080]  The employee told the New York
[3:15:35.080 --> 3:15:36.080]  Post, everyone who comes in the
[3:15:37.080 --> 3:15:38.080]  store buys them. We sold about
[3:15:39.080 --> 3:15:40.080]  50 of those today. Of course,
[3:15:41.080 --> 3:15:42.080]  my main concern if it does
[3:15:43.080 --> 3:15:44.080]  really hit the fan would not be
[3:15:45.080 --> 3:15:46.080]  hand sanitizer. It would be
[3:15:47.080 --> 3:15:48.080]  basic boots.
[3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:50.080]  You know, as much as they're
[3:15:51.080 --> 3:15:52.080]  squabbling over toilet roll.
[3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:54.080]  We're going to get into how Russia
[3:15:54.080 --> 3:15:55.080]  is going to deal with tax problems
[3:15:56.080 --> 3:15:57.080]  40 years ago when they tried to
[3:15:58.080 --> 3:15:59.080]  seize my mother's house.
[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:01.080]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:16:02.080 --> 3:16:03.080]  I beat the IRS then and I've
[3:16:04.080 --> 3:16:05.080]  been beating them ever since.
[3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:07.080]  I wrote the book on tax debt
[3:16:08.080 --> 3:16:09.080]  settlement and I've helped
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:11.080]  thousands of people deal with
[3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:13.080]  tax problems they thought might
[3:16:14.080 --> 3:16:15.080]  never be solved. I can help you
[3:16:16.080 --> 3:16:17.080]  too. If you owe taxes, you can't
[3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:19.080]  pay. Don't wait another day.
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:21.080]  There's no such thing as a
[3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:23.080]  tax debt settlement.
[3:16:24.080 --> 3:16:25.080]  The United States of Empire is
[3:16:26.080 --> 3:16:27.080]  a book that claims the United
[3:16:28.080 --> 3:16:29.080]  States is the empire of the
[3:16:30.080 --> 3:16:31.080]  world. George Washington had
[3:16:32.080 --> 3:16:33.080]  warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:34.080 --> 3:16:35.080]  The United States of Empire
[3:16:36.080 --> 3:16:37.080]  shows that World Wars one and
[3:16:38.080 --> 3:16:39.080]  two left England broken.
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:41.080]  Its former colony, the U.S.
[3:16:42.080 --> 3:16:43.080]  had to save the empire.
[3:16:44.080 --> 3:16:45.080]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:46.080 --> 3:16:47.080]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:48.080 --> 3:16:49.080]  The deep state began with World
[3:16:49.080 --> 3:16:50.080]  War II.
[3:16:51.080 --> 3:16:52.080]  We can all agree these are
[3:16:53.080 --> 3:16:54.080]  troubled times, right?
[3:16:55.080 --> 3:16:56.080]  So do you know who's on your
[3:16:57.080 --> 3:16:58.080]  wireless network?
[3:16:59.080 --> 3:17:00.080]  Whether it's a big company
[3:17:01.080 --> 3:17:02.080]  selling your data or a foreign
[3:17:03.080 --> 3:17:04.080]  hacker, if you're not protected

[3:17:56.080 --> 3:17:57.080]  Infowarslife.com
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:17:59.080]  You go to that URL
[3:18:00.080 --> 3:18:01.080]  it takes you to the subsection
[3:18:02.080 --> 3:18:03.080]  of Infowarsstore.com
[3:18:04.080 --> 3:18:05.080]  where you find the 60 plus
[3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:07.080]  products where we've gone out
[3:18:08.080 --> 3:18:09.080]  and researched what is the best
[3:18:10.080 --> 3:18:11.080]  what gives people the best results
[3:18:11.080 --> 3:18:13.080]  and the best results.
[3:18:14.080 --> 3:18:15.080]  You can see the difference
[3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:17.080]  in me, my energy, my focus
[3:18:18.080 --> 3:18:19.080]  I've lost almost 40 pounds
[3:18:20.080 --> 3:18:21.080]  in less than four months
[3:18:22.080 --> 3:18:23.080]  it's incredible.
[3:18:24.080 --> 3:18:25.080]  So do yourself a favor
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:27.080]  try out the products if you've
[3:18:28.080 --> 3:18:29.080]  been on the fence you can't lose
[3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:31.080]  except if you don't take action
[3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:33.080]  because when you buy the products
[3:18:34.080 --> 3:18:35.080]  you're funding the operation
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:37.080]  that is always delivering
[3:18:38.080 --> 3:18:39.080]  thanks to your support and God's
[3:18:39.080 --> 3:18:40.080]  help.
[3:18:41.080 --> 3:18:42.080]  The real reason you want to get
[3:18:43.080 --> 3:18:44.080]  them is because they're amazing
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:46.080]  and then when you get great results
[3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:48.080]  please tell others about it word of mouth
[3:18:49.080 --> 3:18:50.080]  that's how we expand in the face
[3:18:51.080 --> 3:18:52.080]  of the NWO instead of imploding
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:54.080]  we're fighting to win and we are
[3:18:55.080 --> 3:18:56.080]  winning thanks to you.
[3:18:57.080 --> 3:18:58.080]  What do you think is really going on
[3:18:59.080 --> 3:19:00.080]  and thanks for calling.
[3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:02.080]  So yes I was in Costco a couple weeks
[3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:04.080]  ago I was getting ready I went
[3:19:05.080 --> 3:19:06.080]  to buy a bunch of toilet paper
[3:19:06.080 --> 3:19:08.080]  and I was making on my pocket so I could hear it
[3:19:09.080 --> 3:19:10.080]  I wasn't using headphones and this lady
[3:19:11.080 --> 3:19:12.080]  started says who are you listening to
[3:19:13.080 --> 3:19:14.080]  who's that talking I said this is Alex Jones
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:16.080]  and she just got her eyes got wide open
[3:19:17.080 --> 3:19:18.080]  and she says really I thought he was off
[3:19:19.080 --> 3:19:20.080]  the air and I said no and I told her
[3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:22.080]  I explained you know the whole situation
[3:19:23.080 --> 3:19:24.080]  and told her where to go
[3:19:25.080 --> 3:19:26.080]  she wrote down you know band.video
[3:19:27.080 --> 3:19:28.080]  and also infowords.com and just said
[3:19:29.080 --> 3:19:30.080]  she's still on.
[3:19:31.080 --> 3:19:32.080]  I run into people at the grocery store
[3:19:33.080 --> 3:19:34.080]  at the mall on the hiking bike trail
[3:19:34.080 --> 3:19:35.080]  they're still on air are you ever
[3:19:36.080 --> 3:19:37.080]  going to go back on air and I'm like
[3:19:38.080 --> 3:19:39.080]  we're on hundreds of radio stations
[3:19:40.080 --> 3:19:41.080]  over 100 TV stations and cable stations
[3:19:42.080 --> 3:19:43.080]  we have our own streams at infowords.com
[3:19:44.080 --> 3:19:45.080]  and band.video and they go really
[3:19:46.080 --> 3:19:47.080]  they said you were off the air
[3:19:48.080 --> 3:19:49.080]  because they took the platforming
[3:19:50.080 --> 3:19:51.080]  as off the air.
[3:19:52.080 --> 3:19:53.080]  No we have our own platform info
[3:19:54.080 --> 3:19:55.080]  wars info wars info wars
[3:19:56.080 --> 3:19:57.080]  you're listening to the Alex Jones
[3:19:57.080 --> 3:20:03.080]  show
[3:20:04.080 --> 3:20:08.080]  you're listening to summit.news
[3:20:09.080 --> 3:20:10.080]  with Paul Joseph Watson
[3:20:11.080 --> 3:20:12.080]  how you like me now
[3:20:13.080 --> 3:20:14.080]  how you like me now
[3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:16.080]  we're live and we continue to track
[3:20:17.080 --> 3:20:18.080]  the latest with the coronavirus
[3:20:19.080 --> 3:20:20.080]  put up an article last night on summit.news
[3:20:21.080 --> 3:20:22.080]  headline Russia
[3:20:22.080 --> 3:20:26.080]  in January coronavirus under control
[3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:28.080]  some kind of connection
[3:20:29.080 --> 3:20:30.080]  with Russia with only 20 cases
[3:20:31.080 --> 3:20:32.080]  of the coronavirus
[3:20:33.080 --> 3:20:34.080]  now
[3:20:35.080 --> 3:20:36.080]  the country
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:38.080]  of course single last three days
[3:20:39.080 --> 3:20:40.080]  coronavirus cases have dropped
[3:20:41.080 --> 3:20:42.080]  day by day
[3:20:43.080 --> 3:20:44.080]  to a basically less than a hundred
[3:20:45.080 --> 3:20:46.080]  today I think
[3:20:47.080 --> 3:20:48.080]  I think
[3:20:49.080 --> 3:20:50.080]  I think
[3:20:50.080 --> 3:20:51.080]  the latest numbers were
[3:20:52.080 --> 3:20:53.080]  they've got it under control
[3:20:54.080 --> 3:20:55.080]  now Russia which closes its border
[3:20:56.080 --> 3:20:57.080]  pause back in January
[3:20:58.080 --> 3:20:59.080]  at least most of them
[3:21:00.080 --> 3:21:01.080]  has registered just 20
[3:21:02.080 --> 3:21:03.080]  coronavirus cases many of them
[3:21:04.080 --> 3:21:05.080]  Russians returning from Italy
[3:21:06.080 --> 3:21:07.080]  and zero debt
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:09.080]  this is being tracked by the
[3:21:10.080 --> 3:21:11.080]  Moscow Times
[3:21:12.080 --> 3:21:13.080]  at the end of January Russia
[3:21:14.080 --> 3:21:15.080]  announced it had closed
[3:21:16.080 --> 3:21:17.080]  the entirety of its 2,600 mile
[3:21:17.080 --> 3:21:18.080]  border with China
[3:21:19.080 --> 3:21:20.080]  Moscow also asked all returning
[3:21:21.080 --> 3:21:22.080]  citizens to self quarantine
[3:21:23.080 --> 3:21:24.080]  and ban Chinese citizens
[3:21:25.080 --> 3:21:26.080]  from entering the country
[3:21:27.080 --> 3:21:28.080]  the result of that is that Russia
[3:21:29.080 --> 3:21:30.080]  avoided the kind of panic
[3:21:31.080 --> 3:21:32.080]  there's grit many of the European
[3:21:33.080 --> 3:21:34.080]  countries haven't seen any footage
[3:21:35.080 --> 3:21:36.080]  out of Russia people squabbling
[3:21:37.080 --> 3:21:38.080]  over hand sanitizer
[3:21:39.080 --> 3:21:40.080]  or toilet roll
[3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:42.080]  compare that to Italy
[3:21:43.080 --> 3:21:44.080]  of course ruled by a government
[3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:46.080]  that had closed their borders
[3:21:47.080 --> 3:21:48.080]  after they threw out Salvini
[3:21:49.080 --> 3:21:50.080]  back about six months ago
[3:21:51.080 --> 3:21:52.080]  so Russia's got 20 coronavirus
[3:21:53.080 --> 3:21:54.080]  cases Italy has over 10,000
[3:21:55.080 --> 3:21:56.080]  today I think they've surpassed
[3:21:57.080 --> 3:21:58.080]  500 deaths in fact I think it's
[3:21:59.080 --> 3:22:00.080]  now up to 600 deaths in Italy
[3:22:01.080 --> 3:22:02.080]  they've had to place the entire
[3:22:03.080 --> 3:22:04.080]  country under de facto quarantine
[3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:06.080]  because for the past three, four
[3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:08.080]  weeks and in fact before that as
[3:22:09.080 --> 3:22:10.080]  well of course they had people
[3:22:11.080 --> 3:22:12.080]  fleeing in and out of their
[3:22:12.080 --> 3:22:13.080]  borders people fleeing to the south
[3:22:14.080 --> 3:22:15.080]  of the country before that
[3:22:16.080 --> 3:22:17.080]  quarantine was in place
[3:22:18.080 --> 3:22:19.080]  contrast that with Russia
[3:22:20.080 --> 3:22:21.080]  which again thanks to its strong
[3:22:22.080 --> 3:22:23.080]  border measures
[3:22:24.080 --> 3:22:25.080]  only 20 coronavirus cases
[3:22:26.080 --> 3:22:27.080]  most of them Russians returning
[3:22:28.080 --> 3:22:29.080]  from Italy and most of those
[3:22:30.080 --> 3:22:31.080]  cases already fully recovered
[3:22:32.080 --> 3:22:33.080]  of course zero people have died
[3:22:34.080 --> 3:22:35.080]  in Russia
[3:22:36.080 --> 3:22:37.080]  you compare that to Germany, Spain
[3:22:38.080 --> 3:22:39.080]  France even the UK which has
[3:22:39.080 --> 3:22:41.080]  escaped most of it up until this point
[3:22:42.080 --> 3:22:43.080]  Russia has fared the best
[3:22:44.080 --> 3:22:45.080]  because it had the strongest border
[3:22:46.080 --> 3:22:47.080]  controls I know also today
[3:22:48.080 --> 3:22:49.080]  Mongolia which closed its border
[3:22:50.080 --> 3:22:51.080]  at the same time that Russia did
[3:22:52.080 --> 3:22:53.080]  back at the end of January
[3:22:54.080 --> 3:22:55.080]  only just recorded its first
[3:22:56.080 --> 3:22:57.080]  coronavirus case just today
[3:22:58.080 --> 3:22:59.080]  meanwhile for the past three weeks
[3:23:00.080 --> 3:23:01.080]  plus we've had European leaders
[3:23:02.080 --> 3:23:03.080]  repeatedly insisting that
[3:23:04.080 --> 3:23:05.080]  no border controls will be
[3:23:06.080 --> 3:23:07.080]  implemented and of course
[3:23:07.080 --> 3:23:08.080]  Russia firmly ignored the
[3:23:09.080 --> 3:23:10.080]  World Health Organization's
[3:23:11.080 --> 3:23:12.080]  demands that profiling be avoided
[3:23:13.080 --> 3:23:14.080]  in order to reduce stigmatization
[3:23:15.080 --> 3:23:16.080]  because as we highlighted
[3:23:17.080 --> 3:23:18.080]  in another story last month
[3:23:19.080 --> 3:23:20.080]  they actually had Moscow police
[3:23:21.080 --> 3:23:22.080]  and subway workers
[3:23:23.080 --> 3:23:24.080]  checking passengers believed
[3:23:25.080 --> 3:23:26.080]  to be Chinese
[3:23:27.080 --> 3:23:28.080]  yes they actually did profile
[3:23:29.080 --> 3:23:30.080]  Chinese people for signs of
[3:23:31.080 --> 3:23:32.080]  coronavirus that actually led to
[3:23:33.080 --> 3:23:34.080]  ridiculously
[3:23:34.080 --> 3:23:36.080]  defiling an official complaint
[3:23:37.080 --> 3:23:38.080]  like they haven't imposed draconian
[3:23:39.080 --> 3:23:40.080]  quarantine measures themselves
[3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:42.080]  and unlike other major European
[3:23:43.080 --> 3:23:44.080]  countries such as Italy, Germany
[3:23:45.080 --> 3:23:46.080]  and France whatever Russia is doing
[3:23:47.080 --> 3:23:48.080]  appears to be working and Moscow
[3:23:49.080 --> 3:23:50.080]  certainly won't be making any
[3:23:51.080 --> 3:23:52.080]  apologies for being politically
[3:23:53.080 --> 3:23:54.080]  incorrect so all the major
[3:23:55.080 --> 3:23:56.080]  countries that impose the strongest
[3:23:57.080 --> 3:23:58.080]  border controls the earliest
[3:23:59.080 --> 3:24:00.080]  have escaped the worst of the
[3:24:01.080 --> 3:24:02.080]  coronavirus epidemic
[3:24:02.080 --> 3:24:03.080]  border controls work
[3:24:05.080 --> 3:24:06.080]  meanwhile in America
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:08.080]  and I think this is still the same
[3:24:09.080 --> 3:24:10.080]  in the UK we've still got people
[3:24:11.080 --> 3:24:12.080]  flying in from Italy
[3:24:13.080 --> 3:24:14.080]  up until yesterday at least
[3:24:15.080 --> 3:24:16.080]  to Heathrow to Gatwick to major
[3:24:17.080 --> 3:24:18.080]  airports in the United Kingdom
[3:24:19.080 --> 3:24:20.080]  coming straight back into the
[3:24:21.080 --> 3:24:22.080]  country they're not even testing
[3:24:23.080 --> 3:24:24.080]  them when they land at the airport
[3:24:25.080 --> 3:24:26.080]  now we have this story out of
[3:24:27.080 --> 3:24:28.080]  summit news
[3:24:29.080 --> 3:24:30.080]  airport says DHS is not screening
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:32.080]  travelers arriving from
[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:34.080]  Italy or South Korea
[3:24:35.080 --> 3:24:36.080]  the major airport in Atlanta
[3:24:37.080 --> 3:24:38.080]  has admitted that neither its own
[3:24:39.080 --> 3:24:40.080]  officials nor the Department of
[3:24:41.080 --> 3:24:42.080]  Homeland Security are screening
[3:24:43.080 --> 3:24:44.080]  travelers arriving from Italy or
[3:24:45.080 --> 3:24:46.080]  South Korea to countries where
[3:24:47.080 --> 3:24:48.080]  the coronavirus has hit the hardest
[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:50.080]  outside of China
[3:24:51.080 --> 3:24:52.080]  postfield Jackson Atlanta International
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:54.080]  Airport announced that while the
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:24:56.080]  CDC has demanded screening of
[3:24:57.080 --> 3:24:58.080]  passengers from China and Iran
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:24:59.080]  to South Korea
[3:25:00.080 --> 3:25:01.080]  because they claim those countries
[3:25:02.080 --> 3:25:03.080]  are doing exit screenings
[3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:05.080]  because they don't know the
[3:25:06.080 --> 3:25:07.080]  proficiency to which they're
[3:25:08.080 --> 3:25:09.080]  performing those exit screenings
[3:25:10.080 --> 3:25:11.080]  particularly in Italy
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:13.080]  which is completely overwhelmed at
[3:25:14.080 --> 3:25:15.080]  this point
[3:25:16.080 --> 3:25:17.080]  so essentially officials in the
[3:25:18.080 --> 3:25:19.080]  US are relying on the word of their
[3:25:20.080 --> 3:25:21.080]  foreign counterparts that sufficient
[3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:23.080]  screening is happening before people
[3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:25.080]  leave so again no tests in many
[3:25:25.080 --> 3:25:27.080]  countries and the United States
[3:25:28.080 --> 3:25:29.080]  from people arriving from those
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:31.080]  corona hit countries
[3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:34.080]  and this connects with another
[3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:36.080]  article and we've got the video
[3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:38.080]  clip which we'll play here in a
[3:25:39.080 --> 3:25:40.080]  second Dr. Drew slams media for
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:42.080]  hercing people with coronavirus
[3:25:43.080 --> 3:25:44.080]  panic this is not the first time
[3:25:45.080 --> 3:25:46.080]  that he's sounded the alarm bell
[3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:48.080]  that the bigger problem is not the
[3:25:49.080 --> 3:25:50.080]  virus itself but maybe the hysteria
[3:25:51.080 --> 3:25:52.080]  the panic that we've seen plunged
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:54.080]  over the past week or so
[3:25:55.080 --> 3:25:56.080]  Dr. Drew has once again spoke out
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:25:58.080]  regarding the media's handling
[3:25:59.080 --> 3:26:00.080]  of the coronavirus outbreak
[3:26:01.080 --> 3:26:02.080]  urging the panic being generated
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:04.080]  is hurting people and those spreading
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:06.080]  it should be held accountable
[3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:08.080]  here's the clip
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:10.080]  because the press is continuing to spin it
[3:26:11.080 --> 3:26:12.080]  so you've seen pandemics over the
[3:26:13.080 --> 3:26:14.080]  decades how does this one compare
[3:26:15.080 --> 3:26:16.080]  with everything a bad flu season
[3:26:17.080 --> 3:26:18.080]  is 80,000 dead we've got about 18,000
[3:26:19.080 --> 3:26:20.080]  dead from influenza this year
[3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:21.080]  which should you be worried about
[3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:23.080]  influenza or corona 100 versus 18,000
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:25.080]  because it's not a trick question
[3:26:26.080 --> 3:26:27.080]  and look everything that's going on
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:29.080]  with the New York cleaning the
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:31.080]  subways and everyone using
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:33.080]  chlorx wipes and get your flu shot
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:35.080]  which should be the other message
[3:26:36.080 --> 3:26:37.080]  that's good that's a good thing
[3:26:38.080 --> 3:26:39.080]  so I have no problem with the behaviors
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:41.080]  what I have a problem with is the
[3:26:42.080 --> 3:26:43.080]  panic and the fact that businesses
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:45.080]  are getting destroyed and people's
[3:26:46.080 --> 3:26:47.080]  lives are being upended not by the
[3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:48.080]  pandemic but somehow need to be held
[3:26:49.080 --> 3:26:50.080]  accountable because they are hurting
[3:26:51.080 --> 3:26:52.080]  people so where do you think the
[3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:54.080]  panic started like what besides the
[3:26:55.080 --> 3:26:56.080]  press like what was the impetus in
[3:26:57.080 --> 3:26:58.080]  terms of mass hysteria I saw it
[3:26:59.080 --> 3:27:00.080]  there's a footage of me on a show
[3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:02.080]  called the Daily Blast Live a month
[3:27:03.080 --> 3:27:04.080]  ago going shouldn't we be scared
[3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:06.080]  about this and me going no this
[3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:08.080]  there's going to be this potential
[3:27:09.080 --> 3:27:10.080]  for panic here shut up everybody
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:12.080]  stop talking about I could see the
[3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:14.080]  panic brewing and I could just see
[3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:16.080]  my the press was twisted in that
[3:27:17.080 --> 3:27:18.080]  direction let me give you an example
[3:27:19.080 --> 3:27:20.080]  so the World Health Organization is
[3:27:21.080 --> 3:27:22.080]  out now saying the fatality rate
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:24.080]  from the virus is 3.4% right
[3:27:25.080 --> 3:27:27.080]  every every publication from the
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:30.080]  WHO says 3.4% and we expect it to
[3:27:31.080 --> 3:27:33.080]  fall dramatically once we understand
[3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:35.080]  the full extent of the illness no one
[3:27:36.080 --> 3:27:37.080]  ever reports the actual statement
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:40.080]  right you got 3.4% that's 10 times
[3:27:41.080 --> 3:27:42.080]  more than the whatever five times
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:44.080]  more than the flu virus and yeah
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:46.080]  it's going to be a little more flu
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:48.080]  problem.
[3:27:49.080 --> 3:27:50.080]  So they have doctor who once again
[3:27:51.080 --> 3:27:52.080]  speaking out about the panic whipped
[3:27:53.080 --> 3:27:54.080]  up by the media which of course is
[3:27:55.080 --> 3:27:56.080]  Trump's angle on all this.
[3:27:57.080 --> 3:27:58.080]  Meanwhile we have this story out of
[3:27:59.080 --> 3:28:00.080]  Sky News coronavirus worldwide
[3:28:01.080 --> 3:28:02.080]  people come next winter scientific
[3:28:03.080 --> 3:28:04.080]  model predicts they're saying that
[3:28:05.080 --> 3:28:06.080]  it's going to come back and it's
[3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:08.080]  going to come back in force even
[3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:10.080]  worse than it is now next winter
[3:28:10.080 --> 3:28:11.080]  scientists are warning that even if
[3:28:12.080 --> 3:28:13.080]  coronavirus transmissions dip as we
[3:28:14.080 --> 3:28:15.080]  head into the spring and summer
[3:28:16.080 --> 3:28:17.080]  such a reduction shouldn't be
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:19.080]  mistaken for an end to the outbreak
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:21.080]  instead a reduction of cases during
[3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:23.080]  the summer should be seen as a
[3:28:24.080 --> 3:28:25.080]  precious opportunity to prepare
[3:28:26.080 --> 3:28:27.080]  for next winter when a new model
[3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:29.080]  suggests the virus could infect
[3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:31.080]  100 times more people
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:33.080]  and in the next segment I'm going
[3:28:34.080 --> 3:28:35.080]  to get into another article which
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:37.080]  talks about why there's been so few
[3:28:37.080 --> 3:28:39.080]  cases of the virus that's been
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:41.080]  affected by the coronavirus.
[3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:43.080]  And if that tells us something
[3:28:44.080 --> 3:28:45.080]  about how warm weather can play
[3:28:46.080 --> 3:28:47.080]  a massive impact in stopping the
[3:28:48.080 --> 3:28:49.080]  spread of the coronavirus obviously
[3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:51.080]  as we come up to spring and summer

[3:29:54.080 --> 3:29:55.080]  that the choreographed nature
[3:29:56.080 --> 3:29:57.080]  of the global media and
[3:29:58.080 --> 3:29:59.080]  governments concerning
[3:29:59.080 --> 3:30:01.080]  the global economy was a major
[3:30:02.080 --> 3:30:03.080]  globalist operation now whether
[3:30:04.080 --> 3:30:05.080]  it's super deadly or not the
[3:30:06.080 --> 3:30:07.080]  issue is it's being used by the
[3:30:08.080 --> 3:30:09.080]  globalist as a weapon against
[3:30:10.080 --> 3:30:11.080]  the world economy and against
[3:30:12.080 --> 3:30:13.080]  nation states and against the
[3:30:14.080 --> 3:30:15.080]  populist movement here in

[3:33:18.380 --> 3:33:22.260]  talking about the coronavirus it's not gonna be the coronavirus show we are
[3:33:22.260 --> 3:33:25.380]  gonna talk about some other subjects here coming up including what's
[3:33:25.380 --> 3:33:30.140]  going on down at the border with Greece and Turkey. You heard Dr. Drew there
[3:33:30.140 --> 3:33:34.540]  before the break. Talking about coronavirus panic is the hysteria worse
[3:33:34.540 --> 3:33:39.260]  than the virus itself. We've got speculation that warmer weather is
[3:33:39.260 --> 3:33:44.500]  gonna defeat this to some extent then you've got other models that show it's
[3:33:44.500 --> 3:33:48.420]  gonna come roaring back in winter. There's a headline here from Information
[3:33:48.420 --> 3:33:53.020]  Liberation says Chinese study suggests coronavirus spread slower in warmer
[3:33:53.020 --> 3:33:57.820]  climates. There's comparing official meteorological data with the locations of
[3:33:57.820 --> 3:34:02.540]  all coronavirus infections suggests the virus spreads fastest at 48 degrees
[3:34:02.540 --> 3:34:06.340]  Fahrenheit and drops off at higher temperatures according to Chinese
[3:34:06.340 --> 3:34:11.060]  researchers. They cite the South China Morning Post coronavirus highly
[3:34:11.060 --> 3:34:15.380]  sensitive to high temperatures but don't bank on summer killing it off so
[3:34:15.380 --> 3:34:20.820]  they're suggesting that it does have an impact in dropping the rate of
[3:34:20.820 --> 3:34:27.020]  coronavirus infections because Africa has been relatively untouched by the
[3:34:27.020 --> 3:34:32.340]  virus. One week ago France 24 reported that health experts were puzzled by
[3:34:32.340 --> 3:34:38.100]  their low rates. Only three coronavirus officially recorded coronavirus cases in
[3:34:38.100 --> 3:34:43.020]  Africa as of a few days ago it's probably a few more now but in comparison to the
[3:34:43.020 --> 3:34:48.300]  rest of the world Africa has almost escaped the virus entirely. Meanwhile
[3:34:48.300 --> 3:34:54.180]  Florida has 16 confirmed cases but Governor DeSantis said Florida has not
[3:34:54.180 --> 3:35:00.220]  had community spread of the virus so does does the warmer temperature have an
[3:35:00.220 --> 3:35:05.380]  impact in stopping its spread that's what is being asked. Also being asked by
[3:35:05.380 --> 3:35:11.540]  MSNBC journalist David Goura headline up here on Summit.News MSNBC journalist
[3:35:11.540 --> 3:35:17.180]  claims calling coronavirus Wuhan virus is racist. Is it bigoted? Is it racist to
[3:35:17.180 --> 3:35:23.260]  refer to it as the Wuhan virus? Well Jack Posovic tweeted a list of other
[3:35:23.260 --> 3:35:28.740]  viruses that the world has experienced in the past few decades including West
[3:35:28.740 --> 3:35:36.220]  Nile virus, Zika virus, Ebola virus, German measles, Spanish flu, Marburg virus,
[3:35:36.220 --> 3:35:41.980]  Rocky Mountain spot fever, Stockholm syndrome, Lyme disease, Wuhan virus. A lot
[3:35:41.980 --> 3:35:46.340]  of other viruses have been named after geographic locations so to suggest this
[3:35:46.340 --> 3:35:50.860]  racist to call it the Wuhan virus when that is according to many people the
[3:35:50.860 --> 3:35:56.780]  source the origin of the coronavirus not really racist is it and then also in
[3:35:56.780 --> 3:36:02.380]  this article there's a video embedded where for weeks and in fact now months on
[3:36:02.380 --> 3:36:07.660]  end CNN and other mainstream media networks directly referred to it as the
[3:36:07.660 --> 3:36:12.740]  Wuhan virus and in fact Chinese news sources themselves have repeatedly
[3:36:12.740 --> 3:36:18.140]  referred to it as the Wuhan virus but of course the world health organization
[3:36:18.140 --> 3:36:23.620]  says that choosing the words that we use to talk about it is just as important
[3:36:23.620 --> 3:36:28.140]  as stopping the pandemic itself well now patrolling language isn't as
[3:36:28.140 --> 3:36:34.660]  important as stopping a global pandemic I would argue meanwhile AFP reports
[3:36:34.660 --> 3:36:40.340]  French mayor defense smurf rally after outcry over virus a small French town
[3:36:40.340 --> 3:36:48.580]  decided to hold a gathering of 3,500 people dressed as smurfs this past
[3:36:48.580 --> 3:36:53.820]  weekend probably not the best idea given that France is one of the worst hit
[3:36:53.820 --> 3:36:58.460]  countries in Europe now with the coronavirus the gathering came a day
[3:36:58.460 --> 3:37:03.140]  before France banned all gatherings of more than 1,000 in a bid to contain the
[3:37:03.140 --> 3:37:07.620]  spread of the virus and again the day before that they had a gathering of
[3:37:07.620 --> 3:37:13.820]  3,500 people because having 3,500 people dressed up as smurfs was obviously
[3:37:13.820 --> 3:37:20.380]  very crucial and important despite the fact the coronavirus has infected 1,400
[3:37:20.380 --> 3:37:27.180]  people and killed 25 those numbers are probably even bigger now in France we're
[3:37:27.180 --> 3:37:30.100]  gonna be one now because I don't want this to be the coronavirus show we've
[3:37:30.100 --> 3:37:34.660]  talked about in the entire show let's talk about what's happening down at the
[3:37:34.660 --> 3:37:39.940]  border between Greece and Turkey because of course what is it now a couple of
[3:37:39.940 --> 3:37:44.220]  weeks ago we had Erdogan come out the leader of Turkey the Islamist leader of
[3:37:44.220 --> 3:37:51.260]  Turkey basically he's trying to support the al-Qaeda jihadist rebels in Syria to
[3:37:51.260 --> 3:37:55.620]  depose the Syrian government Bashar al-Assad and because Russia has been
[3:37:55.620 --> 3:38:00.140]  interfering with that once again he opened the floodgates he's basically a
[3:38:00.140 --> 3:38:04.860]  mafia boss now saying that he's gonna remove his protection from those
[3:38:04.860 --> 3:38:09.260]  potentially millions of migrants flooding into Europe from the Middle East
[3:38:09.260 --> 3:38:14.060]  well the Greeks are standing up to it specifically the Greek people headline
[3:38:14.060 --> 3:38:19.980]  video Greek farmer on tractor uses water cannon to repel migrants video out of
[3:38:19.980 --> 3:38:24.100]  Greece shows a farmer on tractor using a water cannon to repel migrants who are
[3:38:24.100 --> 3:38:29.260]  trying to break through the border they've been setting fire to the metal
[3:38:29.260 --> 3:38:33.380]  fencing down there on the border with Turkey so they can try and weaken it and
[3:38:33.380 --> 3:38:39.500]  sneak through the border so this ingenious farmer got on his tractor and
[3:38:39.500 --> 3:38:43.340]  start spraying them all with water not only to get them back away from the
[3:38:43.340 --> 3:38:48.020]  fence but also to make the ground wet making it harder for the migrants to
[3:38:48.020 --> 3:38:53.940]  start the fires they've been burning down refugee centres they've been beating
[3:38:53.940 --> 3:38:58.540]  up NGO workers who are trying to help the migrants illegally get across the
[3:38:58.540 --> 3:39:03.180]  border of course we disavow that completely but now the farmers are
[3:39:03.180 --> 3:39:06.060]  there in their tractors literally spraying the border and getting the
[3:39:06.060 --> 3:39:11.020]  migrants away from them because again they were completely subsumed by hundreds
[3:39:11.020 --> 3:39:16.180]  of thousands of these people from 2015 onwards and it basically wrecked their
[3:39:16.180 --> 3:39:21.460]  country for a significant amount of time they're taking measures against it and
[3:39:21.460 --> 3:39:27.340]  we fully support them Breitbart reports demanding more cash Erdogan walks out of
[3:39:27.340 --> 3:39:32.060]  EU meeting over migrant crisis the Islamist leader of Turkey walked out of
[3:39:32.060 --> 3:39:35.420]  his meeting with European Union officials after the two sides failed to
[3:39:35.420 --> 3:39:40.420]  reach an agreement on the migrant crisis at the Greek border Monday night he had
[3:39:40.420 --> 3:39:45.820]  a meeting with EU officials in Brussels Erdogan and he demanded that the EU
[3:39:45.820 --> 3:39:49.460]  send more financial support in return for halting the flow of migration into
[3:39:49.460 --> 3:39:56.220]  the block bearing in mind they already sent what was it six billion in aid in
[3:39:56.220 --> 3:40:02.820]  2016 simply as mafia protection money for Erdogan to keep that promise to hold
[3:40:02.820 --> 3:40:07.260]  the migrants back and it again goes back to the argument we've been told in the
[3:40:07.260 --> 3:40:11.020]  West for the past five years that diversity is a strength that we can
[3:40:11.020 --> 3:40:14.900]  absorb these millions and millions of migrants anyone who complains about it
[3:40:14.900 --> 3:40:19.900]  as a racist bigger hates refugees meanwhile Erdogan is literally using
[3:40:19.900 --> 3:40:25.220]  them as a weapon literally using them as an intimidation tool for the EU to give
[3:40:25.220 --> 3:40:30.980]  him more money is diversity of strength doesn't really appear so given the
[3:40:30.980 --> 3:40:37.100]  Erdogans literally using them as a weapon meanwhile Breitbart also reports
[3:40:37.100 --> 3:40:43.580]  EU funded Turkish armored vehicle rips down Greek border fence Greek government
[3:40:43.580 --> 3:40:47.180]  has released a night vision video which they claim shows a Turkish armored
[3:40:47.180 --> 3:40:51.940]  vehicle obtained through European Union funding so they're actually using that
[3:40:51.940 --> 3:40:57.940]  protection blackmail money they got from the European Union to rip down the
[3:40:57.940 --> 3:41:03.260]  border and allow more of these migrants to cross video shows and trying to rip
[3:41:03.260 --> 3:41:06.780]  down border fencing and allow illegal migrants to penetrate the Greek border
[3:41:06.780 --> 3:41:11.780]  the statement released with the video said it depict a Turkish armored border
[3:41:11.780 --> 3:41:15.820]  surveillance vehicle which tries to pull down part of the border fence with a
[3:41:15.820 --> 3:41:21.820]  rope that's according to the Greek newspaper catamorini and the associated
[3:41:21.820 --> 3:41:25.660]  press so they're literally using the money that was given to them by the EU to
[3:41:25.660 --> 3:41:31.660]  prevent the migrants from coming across to help the migrants come across that's
[3:41:31.660 --> 3:41:37.460]  Erdogan that's the mafia boss the Islamist boss of Turkey who is so upset
[3:41:37.460 --> 3:41:42.580]  that he's losing the battle in Syria and that is jihadist rebel army getting
[3:41:42.580 --> 3:41:47.140]  killed that he's now using these migrants as a weapon and using European Union
[3:41:47.140 --> 3:41:53.620]  funding to do so another headline here Greek government only 4% of refugees
[3:41:53.620 --> 3:41:58.860]  reaching border are Syrian well what a surprise of course throughout the 2015
[3:41:58.860 --> 3:42:03.620]  16 migrant crisis again we were sold the light that these are Syrian refugees
[3:42:03.620 --> 3:42:08.700]  when that was a tiny proportion of them well that once again is the case just
[3:42:08.700 --> 3:42:12.580]  4% of the supposed refugees who have breached the Greek border in recent days
[3:42:12.580 --> 3:42:18.060]  are Syrians according to the Greek government and they did an analysis of
[3:42:18.060 --> 3:42:28.140]  this found that 64% from Afghanistan 19% from Pakistan 2.6% Somali and in fact
[3:42:28.140 --> 3:42:31.420]  fact the latest figures show that there are more coming across from North
[3:42:31.420 --> 3:42:38.100]  Africa and just 4% of them are Syrian migrants or refugees so they're not
[3:42:38.100 --> 3:42:42.140]  refugees once again they economic migrants trying to penetrate the border
[3:42:42.140 --> 3:42:47.620]  trying to flee to those northern European welfare havens trying to cause much of
[3:42:47.620 --> 3:42:51.620]  the problems that we've seen across Europe over the past five years don't go
[3:42:51.620 --> 3:42:56.060]  away in Alabama rich thanks for calling mr. John's appreciate it first thing I
[3:42:56.060 --> 3:43:02.420]  love the turbo force I drive truck for a living and it's amazing coffee kind of
[3:43:02.420 --> 3:43:06.660]  gives you a little crash there then but that purple force is amazing how is
[3:43:06.660 --> 3:43:12.140]  turbo force different than coffee I'll tell you what it's sustainable anywhere from
[3:43:12.140 --> 3:43:18.180]  18 hours I don't feel the jitters like I do drink and coffee and it's just you
[3:43:18.180 --> 3:43:22.860]  know at the end of the day I don't need anything to go to bed off you know knock
[3:43:22.860 --> 3:43:27.380]  out them I'm out cold well that's what we went out to a top developer who did
[3:43:27.380 --> 3:43:31.020]  want his name on it and I said what would the ultimate long say 10 hour
[3:43:31.020 --> 3:43:35.860]  energy be is that possible that's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of
[3:43:35.860 --> 3:43:38.900]  different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time-released
[3:43:38.900 --> 3:43:42.700]  and there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product so
[3:43:42.700 --> 3:43:47.220]  that's why turbo force has such a great effect and so I really appreciate you and
[3:43:47.220 --> 3:43:53.980]  I'm glad that you like turbo force we know that the globalists are in trouble
[3:43:53.980 --> 3:43:58.700]  humanities waking up to their tyranny how they run their scams their Ponzi
[3:43:58.700 --> 3:44:02.340]  schemes how they're building a post-human world but we know they're
[3:44:02.340 --> 3:44:06.780]  going to strike back and the UN has said that they're going to absolutely
[3:44:06.780 --> 3:44:10.900]  implode third-world countries and then use those giant populations as
[3:44:10.900 --> 3:44:15.140]  weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our
[3:44:15.140 --> 3:44:20.260]  social services in a giant clowered and pivot program the UN also has said
[3:44:20.260 --> 3:44:25.140]  they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government inner
[3:44:25.140 --> 3:44:31.460]  coronavirus this is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed
[3:44:31.460 --> 3:44:35.380]  and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before
[3:44:35.380 --> 3:44:40.260]  but this fight against tyranny is neck and neck so spread the word about band
[3:44:40.260 --> 3:44:46.380]  a dot video and in full wars dot com for its last show that is so important you
[3:44:46.380 --> 3:44:52.100]  are at the center of the resistance you are our only hope
[3:44:52.660 --> 3:44:56.220]  real stuff man we're talking about the real deal here and I love Trump all day
[3:44:56.220 --> 3:44:59.540]  long but man I tell you he sits there and lets these big tech people keep
[3:44:59.540 --> 3:45:03.660]  running rough shot over and everybody I'm I mean I've got a problem and we'll
[3:45:03.660 --> 3:45:07.220]  just take the Trump rallies over that said about two months ago I came with a
[3:45:07.220 --> 3:45:11.420]  plan that I haven't launched yet we have a warehouse full of hundreds of
[3:45:11.420 --> 3:45:16.020]  thousands of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the Democrats save the
[3:45:16.020 --> 3:45:19.380]  Second Amendment defend the First Amendment in full wars dot com and it
[3:45:19.380 --> 3:45:21.900]  looks like duct tape but it's just a regular stick you put it over your
[3:45:21.900 --> 3:45:25.460]  mouth you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without even
[3:45:25.460 --> 3:45:28.460]  disrupting things people say why are you doing this what's happening when you
[3:45:28.460 --> 3:45:32.020]  go well we're being censored you know Trump won't do anything about it and

[3:47:04.900 --> 3:47:11.540]  transmitting worldwide from the summit.new studios in the United Kingdom
[3:47:11.540 --> 3:47:20.820]  you are listening to her Joseph Watson as people in Australia New Zealand the
[3:47:20.820 --> 3:47:24.980]  United Kingdom and elsewhere squabble over hand sanitizer and toilet roll
[3:47:24.980 --> 3:47:30.740]  first people aren't prepared whatsoever for outbreaks like the coronavirus
[3:47:30.740 --> 3:47:35.220]  and other world destabilizing events of course now the CDC itself is telling
[3:47:35.220 --> 3:47:40.580]  seniors to hoard supplies basically have at least two weeks with the supplies
[3:47:40.580 --> 3:47:45.220]  food supplies in their homes to deal with the coronavirus if they can't go
[3:47:45.220 --> 3:47:50.580]  outside we've seen video out of Italy today with health authorities with loud
[3:47:50.580 --> 3:47:55.340]  speakers cruising around neighborhoods telling Italians to stay indoors and to
[3:47:55.340 --> 3:48:01.180]  only come outside if they're picking up medical supplies or seeing a doctor those
[3:48:01.180 --> 3:48:07.060]  people hopefully have some level of food security in their homes have some level
[3:48:07.060 --> 3:48:12.460]  of storable food and if you don't have that now is there's no time like now to
[3:48:12.460 --> 3:48:16.420]  be stocking up on it which is why we have the emergency survival foods still
[3:48:16.420 --> 3:48:21.380]  available at m4store.com of course we've had massive demand and that has
[3:48:21.380 --> 3:48:27.700]  called some delays there's an update here on the page at m4store.com says my
[3:48:27.700 --> 3:48:31.540]  Patriot supply has opened two new food production facilities today bringing
[3:48:31.540 --> 3:48:38.100]  a total to four food processing plants so we will hopefully shortly have this

[3:49:47.940 --> 3:49:52.460]  tech news I wrote an article just before I came on air here this evening it's up
[3:49:52.460 --> 3:49:57.300]  on summit dot news psychologist big tech will use subliminal methods to shift
[3:49:57.300 --> 3:50:03.940]  15 million votes on election day this is an issue we've talked about many times
[3:50:03.940 --> 3:50:08.940]  before and this is something that Robert Epstein is so passionate about that in
[3:50:08.940 --> 3:50:14.060]  this article which I linked to he emphasises that he's not suicidal of
[3:50:14.060 --> 3:50:18.860]  course that he had the tragic accidental death of his wife in a car accident back
[3:50:18.860 --> 3:50:23.740]  in December and Epstein himself in a tweet suggested it may not have been
[3:50:23.740 --> 3:50:28.500]  accidental simply because of the gravitas of the information that he's
[3:50:28.500 --> 3:50:33.340]  putting out when it comes to big tech manipulation remember he's done the
[3:50:33.340 --> 3:50:39.700]  studies and in fact in 2016 he did the study where he gauged that search engine
[3:50:39.700 --> 3:50:44.740]  bias and algorithmic manipulation to the point where a certain candidate is
[3:50:44.740 --> 3:50:49.540]  ranked above another on a Google search result or a positive or negative story
[3:50:49.540 --> 3:50:53.740]  about that candidate is ranked above another on a Google search result the
[3:50:53.740 --> 3:50:58.940]  algorithmic manipulation can shift millions of votes he said it shifted two
[3:50:58.940 --> 3:51:05.060]  to three million votes in Hillary Clinton's favour back in 2016 he's now
[3:51:05.060 --> 3:51:11.540]  saying that number in 2020 there'd be five times as much when he writes in his
[3:51:11.540 --> 3:51:16.380]  article social media giants can shift opinions and votes in numerous ways that
[3:51:16.380 --> 3:51:22.340]  people can't detect via a wide variety of subliminal methods of persuasion that
[3:51:22.340 --> 3:51:27.500]  can in minutes shift the voting preferences of 20% or more of undecided
[3:51:27.500 --> 3:51:32.340]  voters without anyone having the slightest idea they've been manipulated
[3:51:32.340 --> 3:51:38.660]  and all he's talking about is in what order certain stories are ranked in your
[3:51:38.660 --> 3:51:43.260]  news feed or in Google search results have had of course we've had the massive
[3:51:43.260 --> 3:51:48.580]  scandal with YouTube proven in triplicate at one point on YouTube which
[3:51:48.580 --> 3:51:52.180]  bear in mind is the second biggest search engine in the world you could type
[3:51:52.180 --> 3:51:57.220]  in my name and not even find my videos apart from the ones debunking and
[3:51:57.220 --> 3:52:01.580]  attacking me they got it down to that level of manipulation where somebody
[3:52:01.580 --> 3:52:05.660]  with nearly two million subscribers on their own platform was completely
[3:52:05.660 --> 3:52:11.180]  blacklisted when you did an exact search for my name of course Alex Jones is
[3:52:11.180 --> 3:52:16.100]  completely boot from there back in 2018 but in this article Epstein talks
[3:52:16.100 --> 3:52:19.980]  about the leaked Google emails which were published by the Wall Street Journal
[3:52:19.980 --> 3:52:24.300]  back in 2018 which exposed how Google engineers had sought to investigate how
[3:52:24.300 --> 3:52:30.580]  they could manipulate a user's ephemeral experiences to change their mind on the
[3:52:30.580 --> 3:52:36.220]  Trump travel ban and again he's talking about the fleeting moments we have
[3:52:36.220 --> 3:52:40.620]  every day when we view online content that's generated on the fly and isn't
[3:52:40.620 --> 3:52:45.700]  stored anywhere news feeds search suggestions remember the auto complete
[3:52:45.700 --> 3:52:51.220]  suggestions back in 2016 where you could go on Bing you could go on Yahoo you
[3:52:51.220 --> 3:52:56.340]  could go on DuckDuckGo any other search engine and type in Hillary Clinton the
[3:52:56.340 --> 3:53:00.900]  auto complete suggestions would mainly be negative you go on Google they're all
[3:53:00.900 --> 3:53:06.180]  positive of course what is it Google has swallowed up now 75 80 percent of
[3:53:06.180 --> 3:53:11.620]  search traffic and he writes in the article no authority can go back in
[3:53:11.620 --> 3:53:15.220]  time to see what search suggestions or search results you were shown but
[3:53:15.220 --> 3:53:19.860]  dozens of randomized controlled double blind experiments I've conducted show
[3:53:19.860 --> 3:53:25.820]  that such content can dramatically shift opinions and voting preferences he's
[3:53:25.820 --> 3:53:31.860]  talking about it shifting 15 million votes in the 2020 presidential election
[3:53:31.860 --> 3:53:37.220]  without leaving any kind of paper trail he talks about Eisenhower's speech the
[3:53:37.220 --> 3:53:41.860]  military the infamous military industrial complex speech back in 1961 where
[3:53:41.860 --> 3:53:47.020]  of course he warned of a technological elite taking control now that
[3:53:47.020 --> 3:53:53.300]  technological elite in Silicon Valley is in control they donate 95 percent of
[3:53:53.300 --> 3:53:59.380]  their money to Democrats social media companies their employees 95 percent of
[3:53:59.380 --> 3:54:04.020]  their donations go to Democrats they're in control they're in control of the
[3:54:04.020 --> 3:54:09.180]  algorithm the algorithm is king there's a manner if you make a political ad to
[3:54:09.180 --> 3:54:14.540]  compete with your adversaries competing political ad if Google decides not to
[3:54:14.540 --> 3:54:18.500]  show it if Facebook decides not to promote it in your feed to your followers
[3:54:18.500 --> 3:54:23.980]  they ain't gonna see it that's how they win and again he says I'm not suicidal
[3:54:23.980 --> 3:54:27.380]  because the gravitas of this information that he's trying to put out but
[3:54:27.380 --> 3:54:32.300]  he cautions quote Republicans in general are likely to lose if we don't
[3:54:32.300 --> 3:54:38.420]  aggressively focus on algorithmic manipulation and indeed report it to the
[3:54:38.420 --> 3:54:45.500]  federal election commission and Congress as election meddling he's been he's
[3:54:45.500 --> 3:54:49.580]  been hopping on about this for the past four or five years of course Trump was
[3:54:49.580 --> 3:54:52.940]  monitoring the situation when we all got banned and nothing was done
[3:54:52.940 --> 3:54:57.060]  Republicans haven't really done anything to address this this is the biggest
[3:54:57.060 --> 3:55:01.580]  example of election meddling when you can change an algorithm to shift up to
[3:55:01.580 --> 3:55:07.380]  15 million votes on election day and he ran studies with the biggest democratic
[3:55:07.380 --> 3:55:12.020]  election in the world the election in India he found the exact same thing it
[3:55:12.020 --> 3:55:17.140]  shifted 10 million votes during that election now Epstein is warning that it
[3:55:17.140 --> 3:55:23.420]  could shift up to 15 million on election day 2020 and nobody is really
[3:55:23.420 --> 3:55:28.420]  talking about it should be a way bigger deal than it is talking about social
[3:55:28.420 --> 3:55:33.180]  media manipulation another headline here journalists suspended by Twitter after
[3:55:33.180 --> 3:55:38.820]  exposing Carlos Mazza's wealth hypocrisy because Carlos Mazza was the Vox
[3:55:38.820 --> 3:55:43.980]  journalist who tried to get Steven Crowder banned from YouTube because
[3:55:43.980 --> 3:55:48.740]  Crowder insulted him we had that controversy back last summer well now
[3:55:48.740 --> 3:55:53.340]  he was exposed Mazza again he's a self-proclaimed communist he rails
[3:55:53.340 --> 3:55:57.900]  against the rich he literally talks about eating the rich well New York
[3:55:57.900 --> 3:56:04.620]  Post journalist did an article John Levine exposing about how Mazza again
[3:56:04.620 --> 3:56:08.780]  rails against the wealth against the wealthy yet enjoys all the privileges of
[3:56:08.780 --> 3:56:13.940]  being from an extremely wealthy family this guy's family has numerous mega
[3:56:13.940 --> 3:56:20.420]  mansions his mother is rich his mother's partner is probably a billionaire so
[3:56:20.420 --> 3:56:24.420]  there was a big expose article by Levine on call us Mazza this YouTube
[3:56:24.420 --> 3:56:30.500]  communist showcasing how wealthy his family was he showed one image he
[3:56:30.500 --> 3:56:35.180]  tweeted one image of one of these mansions owned by Mazza's family and
[3:56:35.180 --> 3:56:40.740]  the tweet was deleted John Levine the New York Post journalist was suspended
[3:56:40.740 --> 3:56:44.620]  obviously because they claimed it was doxing and just the same as this
[3:56:44.620 --> 3:56:49.100]  manipulated media tag which they're now using against Trump and his big
[3:56:49.100 --> 3:56:54.260]  supporters but not using against Joe Biden when he puts out manipulated media
[3:56:54.260 --> 3:56:59.700]  they're now saying that this was doxing despite the fact that Mazza himself did
[3:56:59.700 --> 3:57:05.340]  the exact same thing when he posted an image of James Carville's home just
[3:57:05.340 --> 3:57:11.900]  last month while complaining about Carville's wealth Carlos Mazza faced
[3:57:11.900 --> 3:57:16.460]  zero action from Twitter last time I checked John Levine's original tweets
[3:57:16.460 --> 3:57:21.860]  showing one of these mansions mansions owned by Carlos Mazza's family it was
[3:57:21.860 --> 3:57:26.220]  deleted he was suspended he had to delete the tweet in order to get access back
[3:57:26.220 --> 3:57:30.100]  to his account so once again with Silicon Valley it's one rule for leftists
[3:57:30.100 --> 3:57:33.900]  and another and another for conservatives they continue this election
[3:57:33.900 --> 3:57:38.460]  meddling manipulation that's gonna wrap it up for the show come on next is
[3:57:38.460 --> 3:57:57.140]  warring with Owen Schreyer don't go away breaking news
