[00:00.000 --> 00:06.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:06.760 --> 00:10.280]  It's May 31, 2016, here's John Bowne reporting.
[00:10.280 --> 00:15.920]  Welcome to the BS Club, hosted by the United Kingdom's New World Order-backed propaganda
[00:15.920 --> 00:17.720]  machine, The Guardian.
[00:17.720 --> 00:23.040]  Apparently, The Guardian didn't have any problem rolling out the following baseless
[00:23.040 --> 00:26.920]  drivel to its readers slash YouTube viewers.
[00:26.920 --> 00:32.680]  Of course, commenting on the U.S. presidential election whilst ignoring the massive problems
[00:32.680 --> 00:36.880]  in your own country is a sketchy undertaking to begin with.
[00:36.880 --> 00:43.200]  But when your publication is run by an elitist New World Order lackey like Dame Liz Forgin,
[00:43.200 --> 00:50.560]  the Dame, being her high masonic title, allowing Forgin to rub elbows with royalty, media oligarchs
[00:50.560 --> 00:54.240]  and the Lord Rothschild, you do as expected.
[00:54.240 --> 00:59.680]  Here is what the Telegraph had to say about Dame Liz in 2013 before she became the chair
[00:59.680 --> 01:04.560]  of Scott Trust Limited, the British company that owns The Guardian Media Group.
[01:04.560 --> 01:06.040]  The Telegraph writes,
[01:06.040 --> 01:11.760]  Why not spend 8,000 pounds on a leaving due, a party held when leaving a job?
[01:11.760 --> 01:15.160]  That's what Dame Liz and her cast are entitled to.
[01:15.160 --> 01:18.080]  That's what the little people are there to pay for.
[01:18.080 --> 01:23.040]  There could be no clearer demonstration of the contempt that Dame Liz, who exudes the
[01:23.040 --> 01:28.120]  haughty sense of self-worth and entitlement that typifies the arts establishment, has
[01:28.120 --> 01:33.720]  for the rest of us, that she chose a drinks party funded by the taxpayer to attack the
[01:33.720 --> 01:40.520]  government for cutting the arts budget, contempt, and a jaw-dropping lack of self-awareness.
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.840]  So without further ado, here is The Guardian's Stephen Thrasher looking forward to the day
[01:45.840 --> 01:52.280]  when America's dying white majority is overthrown and a political revolution led by people
[01:52.280 --> 01:58.440]  of color ends the white supremacist system currently represented by Donald Trump's presidential
[01:58.440 --> 01:59.440]  campaign.
[01:59.440 --> 02:04.360]  When we had a clear symbol that the country is literally becoming more black, why shouldn't
[02:04.360 --> 02:09.360]  we have expected this successor to be the meanest, widest, most vile, bigot possible?
[02:09.360 --> 02:13.880]  And when protesters demanded that black lives matter, why shouldn't we have anticipated the
[02:13.880 --> 02:18.480]  rise of a candidate who encourages violence against peaceful denizens?
[02:18.480 --> 02:21.680]  A president Trump would fit right into American history.
[02:21.680 --> 02:27.400]  I'm waiting for the year 2043 when this white supremacist nation becomes mostly non-white.
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.000]  That's when true political revolution might be possible.
[02:30.000 --> 02:35.760]  Thrasher, you work for the so-called dying white majority, completely ignoring that Europe
[02:35.760 --> 02:41.640]  and now the United States are quietly being invaded by Sharia law zealots hell-bent on
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.960]  throwing people of Thrasher's persuasion off of rooftops.
[02:45.960 --> 02:52.560]  Not to be outdone in the threat-laced propaganda lecturing is Guardian columnist Jonathan Friedland.
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.320]  The world is watching, then the world was inspired, now we're scared.
[02:57.320 --> 03:01.880]  You won't rule out dropping a nuclear bomb on Europe, Islamophobia would be a matter
[03:01.880 --> 03:06.080]  of state policy if you're Mexican, you'll know that the American president thinks you're
[03:06.080 --> 03:08.720]  basically a criminal or a rapist.
[03:08.720 --> 03:12.600]  There'll be a surge of what people will call anti-Americanism.
[03:12.600 --> 03:16.120]  People among the nation are dumb, vulgar and aggressive.
[03:16.120 --> 03:20.720]  It'll be like it was in the George W. Bush years, only much, much worse.
[03:20.720 --> 03:25.880]  Friedland, your smug elitist arrogance and weak threats are just as bad as your flaccid
[03:25.880 --> 03:28.520]  declaration of anti-Americanism.
[03:28.520 --> 03:33.000]  Your sycophantic jabbering makes me wonder when you're due back in the city of London
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.640]  for your umpteenth microchipping.
[03:35.640 --> 03:40.920]  And here's yet another Guardian columnist, Gary Young, to lecture us on our democracy
[03:40.920 --> 03:46.320]  in crisis, claiming Americans are blaming the refugees solely for the soft invasion
[03:46.320 --> 03:52.360]  of Europe and the United States, an invasion engineered by the very globalist signing Young's
[03:52.360 --> 03:53.360]  paychecks.
[03:53.360 --> 03:58.200]  His ascent is part of a rise in right-wing populism throughout the Western world.
[03:58.200 --> 04:04.520]  Most Western nations have their own Trump, a racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic demagogue
[04:04.520 --> 04:10.640]  appealing to a mix of nationalist nostalgia, patriotic myth, class grievance and economic
[04:10.640 --> 04:11.640]  insecurity.
[04:11.640 --> 04:15.920]  Now, liberal commentators describe them as a threat to democracy, but it would be more
[04:15.920 --> 04:20.640]  accurate to understand them as the product of democracy already in crisis.
[04:20.640 --> 04:26.840]  The overall direction of the Guardian is going to be decided by the people who run the trust,
[04:26.840 --> 04:32.880]  and it will also include many powerful people who are very plugged into the international
[04:32.880 --> 04:33.880]  finance community.
[04:33.880 --> 04:41.960]  Any time Guardian columnist Steven Thrasher, Jonathan Friedland, Gary Young and Dame Forgan
[04:41.960 --> 04:47.320]  for that matter want to have a debate over their claims, myself and a few other info
[04:47.320 --> 04:52.800]  warriors would be happy to educate you on the glaring realities staring you squarely
[04:52.800 --> 05:04.840]  in the face, John Bown for InfoWars.com US Internet Giants Facebook, Twitter, Google
[05:04.840 --> 05:10.000]  and Microsoft pledged to tackle online hate speech in less than 24 hours as part of a
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.560]  joint commitment with the European Union to combat the use of social media by terrorists,
[05:15.560 --> 05:17.200]  reports Bloomberg News.
[05:17.200 --> 05:21.760]  Beyond national laws that criminalize hate speech, they say there is a need to ensure
[05:21.760 --> 05:28.200]  that such activity by Internet users is quote, expeditiously reviewed by online intermediaries
[05:28.200 --> 05:34.280]  and social media platforms upon receipt of a valid notification in an appropriate timeframe.
[05:34.280 --> 05:38.880]  The companies and the European Commission said in a joint statement Tuesday, the code
[05:38.880 --> 05:44.080]  of conduct arrives as Europe comes to terms with the bloody attacks in Paris and Brussels
[05:44.080 --> 05:49.840]  by the Islamic State, who use social media as a recruitment tool, even though many milder
[05:49.840 --> 05:53.120]  messages have been censored by the social networks.
[05:53.120 --> 06:23.080]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[07:09.680 --> 07:13.160]  and affordable, great tasting multivitamin formula available.

[08:02.360 --> 08:07.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[08:07.960 --> 08:21.360]  It is good to be back in the saddle again broadcasting worldwide on radio and television
[08:21.360 --> 08:25.720]  from central Texas, Austin.
[08:25.720 --> 08:26.720]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[08:26.720 --> 08:29.880]  Hope you've had a good Memorial Day weekend.
[08:29.880 --> 08:33.560]  It is good to be back.
[08:33.560 --> 08:40.080]  Well if you go up to infowars.com, it becomes very, very clear exactly what is unfolding
[08:40.080 --> 08:43.440]  with the headlines there.
[08:43.440 --> 08:50.760]  But another place to go to get a clear image of the big push is drudgereport.com.
[08:50.760 --> 08:57.080]  The major social websites of the world owned by the globalists say stop the hate.
[08:57.080 --> 09:03.840]  That giant's vow to tackle bad speech within 24 hours.
[09:03.840 --> 09:11.720]  Words directed against anyone over issues of race, color, religion will be shut down.
[09:11.720 --> 09:17.320]  National dissent or national or ethnic origins will be banned unless you're the London Guardian,
[09:17.320 --> 09:23.280]  Facebook, The New York Times and others coming out saying white people are inherently evil
[09:23.280 --> 09:27.560]  and inherently bad and that there's a new cultural revolution against them.
[09:27.560 --> 09:35.080]  This is an attempt to sell racism to the third world and to old world countries, flood what's
[09:35.080 --> 09:41.000]  left of the West with those people and assign racial identity to collectivism, socialism
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.640]  and authoritarianism.
[09:42.640 --> 09:45.000]  Then you've conquered the planet.
[09:45.000 --> 09:53.560]  So this is a force feed operation just looking at the demographics to bill if you live in
[09:53.560 --> 09:58.560]  Africa or Latin America or Asia or the Middle East or Eastern Europe that the fall of the
[09:58.560 --> 10:01.560]  West is how you get ahead.
[10:01.560 --> 10:05.080]  When the social engineers on record are doing everything they can to keep those countries
[10:05.080 --> 10:11.840]  in squalor and in total social control as well with UN vaccine medical forces out there
[10:11.840 --> 10:23.920]  openly injecting people with every bio weapon ever heard of, it is simply amazing.
[10:23.920 --> 10:29.920]  So that is just some of what we're going to be breaking down here today, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:29.920 --> 10:38.280]  It is incredible and it's because of the cultural ignorance of the average Westerner.
[10:38.280 --> 10:46.280]  We have a TV culture, we have a vapid, centimeter deep ocean of mindless boobs on average who
[10:46.280 --> 10:51.120]  have no conception of how the world even works and then meanwhile you've got third world
[10:51.120 --> 10:58.120]  countries being given culture by the multinational combines that control their governments and
[10:58.120 --> 11:06.200]  that culture is an absolute hatred and vitriol against the West and against anyone with lack
[11:06.200 --> 11:10.040]  of melanin in their skin.
[11:10.040 --> 11:18.380]  This is colonialism reformed by Christians reformed by the West selling Renaissance worldwide
[11:18.380 --> 11:22.600]  trying to turn the planet around into a new era of prosperity.
[11:22.600 --> 11:26.920]  We become the most wealthy and powerful because we have the most freedom then the corrupt
[11:26.920 --> 11:31.200]  systems come take us over and turn us into an engine to take over the planet.
[11:31.200 --> 11:42.720]  They then flip that back inwardly take our guilt that the West has exacerbated and then
[11:42.720 --> 11:48.000]  tell us politically we must be slaves and accept the terms of surrender or we're going
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.360]  to be called racist and then when we do surrender the demonization the race baiting the cultural
[11:54.360 --> 12:01.960]  warfare the class warfare only triples on a yearly basis only gets worse so again the
[12:01.960 --> 12:09.280]  West was first to recognize true human barbarism on average and try to reverse it and try to
[12:09.280 --> 12:15.960]  curtail it and try to actually create wealth and prosperity for all comparatively that's
[12:15.960 --> 12:19.720]  a historical fact it's incontrovertible.
[12:19.720 --> 12:28.840]  Now because of our Christian ethos we love to beat ourselves with cultural whips and
[12:28.840 --> 12:34.880]  engage in all these different forms of pentance and we want to pay cultural indulgences to
[12:34.880 --> 12:39.600]  the government to the media to the culture to prove ourselves worthy it's the new religion
[12:39.600 --> 12:46.200]  they've replaced repressive forms of state run Christianity that the Renaissance was
[12:46.200 --> 12:52.960]  all about stopping and promoting true Christian ideals and they've just returned us to a new
[12:52.960 --> 12:58.120]  form of tyranny under a new religious basis that is political correctness that's what
[12:58.120 --> 13:02.160]  it is it's a religion merged with the whole green religion that isn't about saving the
[13:02.160 --> 13:11.520]  earth but about demonizing humanity itself and so here it is it's it's official I told
[13:11.520 --> 13:17.880]  you it was coming Matt drudge told you it was coming we saw the head of the federal
[13:17.880 --> 13:28.800]  elections commission come out we saw 40% of the FCC board vote last year it failed but
[13:28.800 --> 13:40.800]  narrowly to come out and restrict the first amendment heavily and to give you an internet
[13:40.800 --> 13:46.680]  ID basically where if you get three strikes like YouTube you aren't suspended off YouTube
[13:46.680 --> 13:51.360]  you are suspended off of the internet and you won't be able to work or have jobs or
[13:51.360 --> 13:57.520]  do anything but meanwhile they're gonna expose the records of felons who go through cultural
[13:57.520 --> 14:03.840]  governmental retraining to be left to street operatives and so they will now have armies
[14:03.840 --> 14:09.920]  of felons working for them but you won't be able to have a job and the TSA as they said
[14:09.920 --> 14:14.520]  14 years ago in a congressional meeting on C-SPAN I've been telling you since it happened
[14:14.520 --> 14:19.720]  I played clips when it happened they said then the TSA will decide what job you have
[14:19.720 --> 14:24.800]  or if you can have a job with a national ID card but that won't be enforced on the
[14:24.800 --> 14:33.360]  illegals I mean this is so massive this is so over the top this is truly our journey
[14:33.360 --> 14:39.520]  into bond is becoming almost complete so here's Bloomberg the headline should be tech giants
[14:39.520 --> 14:44.840]  working with multinationals prepare a giant offensive against free speech worldwide as
[14:44.840 --> 14:54.680]  globalism goes into high gear and as the world financial collapse goes into its next phase
[14:54.680 --> 14:59.280]  elites accelerate massive censorship ahead of crackdowns on freedoms worldwide that should
[14:59.280 --> 15:03.880]  be the headline they're already arresting people in Germany and Sweden and France who
[15:03.880 --> 15:10.360]  mildly criticize the open borders but now it's just calmly reported tech giants of
[15:10.360 --> 15:19.960]  Val to no big deal tech giants of Val to tackle online hate speech within 24 hours US Internet
[15:19.960 --> 15:25.200]  Giants Facebook ink Twitter ink Google and Microsoft core pledged to tackle online hate
[15:25.200 --> 15:29.960]  speech unless the 24 hours as part of a joint commitment with the European Union to combat
[15:29.960 --> 15:36.160]  the use of social media by terrorist oh we've got to take everyone's speech because of the
[15:36.160 --> 15:44.800]  terrorist because of the bad little because the bad little terrorist bad little terrorist
[15:44.800 --> 15:52.000]  are going to get us and because they're going to get us with their bombs because the government
[15:52.000 --> 16:03.280]  brought them in 5 million of our little loving friends have been brought in and 80% according
[16:03.280 --> 16:08.920]  to Interpol or military aged men and I got stacks of news of them raping and robbing
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.280]  and killing and highways shut down and total bedlam and ferries shut down and just men
[16:13.280 --> 16:17.120]  running around with knives foaming at the mouth and the police running and cowering
[16:17.120 --> 16:21.480]  in fear I mean this is what Europe is this has been done by design by the socialist and
[16:21.480 --> 16:26.320]  they're going to bring it completely down and then like they're doing all over the UK
[16:26.320 --> 16:30.960]  they're going to put Muslims in charge as the police chiefs with socialist under them
[16:30.960 --> 16:35.120]  and they're going to persecute and they're going to arrest they're going to take over
[16:35.120 --> 16:39.120]  and the average Western male is going to roll over on his back and get in a field position
[16:39.120 --> 16:44.120]  like a dog when it's scared and start urinating on themselves I'm not getting this is what
[16:44.120 --> 16:50.520]  we do this is what we've been taught to do and we're dead because of it but it's also
[16:50.520 --> 16:57.160]  liberal and trendy US internet giants Facebook and Twitter and Google and Microsoft core
[16:57.160 --> 17:04.120]  pledged to tackle online hate speech in less than 24 hours as part of a joint commitment
[17:04.120 --> 17:09.720]  with the European Union with the government to combat the use of social media by terrorist
[17:09.720 --> 17:13.120]  and of course if you criticize the open borders they arrest you in Germany and France or their
[17:13.120 --> 17:17.080]  places and let the Muslims run around do whatever they want so see they bring them in and then
[17:17.080 --> 17:21.400]  use them to take everybody else's freedoms beyond the actual laws of criminalize hate
[17:21.400 --> 17:27.680]  speech there is a need to ensure such activity by internet users is expeditiously reviewed
[17:27.680 --> 17:33.560]  by online intermediaries and social media platforms under receipt of a valid notification
[17:33.560 --> 17:37.240]  in the appropriate time frame the companies and the European Commission said in a joint
[17:37.240 --> 17:44.960]  statement today and of course what's going to be done with all of this is it's all better
[17:44.960 --> 17:50.400]  to test it first in China now in Europe now here and it's already begun by the way groveling
[17:50.400 --> 17:56.120]  didn't do too well for him normally those that sell out of the ones that have their
[17:56.120 --> 18:02.680]  political heads lopped off first serious XM announces suspension of one back over rad
[18:02.680 --> 18:08.080]  for interview comments where he came out and basically said somebody needs to kill Trump
[18:08.080 --> 18:15.880]  for the second time now let me explain something they're just using that I'm not defending
[18:15.880 --> 18:19.840]  what Beck said as an excuse to get rid of him they already got rid of over 300 libertarian
[18:19.840 --> 18:26.720]  host despite the fact that we got him top signups and there was another division that
[18:26.720 --> 18:31.880]  years ago put me on and was love what my show was doing great sponsorship great you name
[18:31.880 --> 18:36.520]  it one of the only profitable areas of serious XM was a whole libertarian group of channels
[18:36.520 --> 18:42.960]  two of them and they had us on twice a day it was so popular and point blank Goldman
[18:42.960 --> 18:48.720]  Sachs subsidiary bought it up clear channel got pushed out I don't work with clear channel
[18:48.720 --> 18:52.360]  but they they were it was a division of some patriots a clear channel put me on like ten
[18:52.360 --> 18:56.560]  years ago I was on for about seven years and they told me the inside baseball what happened
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.000]  we were removed a couple years ago and they said it's coming across the board and then
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.080]  see Beck who's out there supporting us getting taken off the air and things and saying we're
[19:05.080 --> 19:10.920]  dangerous see it's happening to you now no until I mean they're a quote private company
[19:10.920 --> 19:14.360]  they knew what they want but until you know he actually got in trouble or got indicted
[19:14.360 --> 19:19.040]  or something I think I think they shouldn't have happened but but regardless it's only
[19:19.040 --> 19:23.520]  being done now because the climate they think is safe when they start moving against everybody
[19:23.520 --> 19:28.880]  it means they're just doing it and what did Matt Drudge warn us about last year I'm gonna
[19:28.880 --> 19:32.760]  play that clip when we come back he said these are internet ghettos which are gulags basically
[19:32.760 --> 19:38.640]  step one and he said they're coming I was told by Supreme Court Justice in private and I and
[19:38.640 --> 19:41.960]  the folks I've been told now a lot of folks say well let's just go along with this and
[19:41.960 --> 19:45.920]  they'll leave us alone no that's how they win you got to exercise free speech now or

[25:02.760 --> 25:09.360]  same time a larger contingent of people are either selfish and just don't care or dumber

[26:06.120 --> 26:13.360]  are in they admit they're tracking us controlling our homes taxing us regulating us it's an it's
[26:13.360 --> 26:20.200]  an organized crime revolution against civilization by the technocrats who openly have met and
[26:20.200 --> 26:24.480]  openly met with world governments and are openly coordinating with the communist Chinese
[26:24.480 --> 26:33.800]  the EU and the US government to go into the next phase and that is casual society bail
[26:33.800 --> 26:37.560]  ends where they grab money out of your bank account where every action you get charged
[26:37.560 --> 26:46.560]  for or any type of grassroots economy is outlawed this is hardcore and they're doing it and
[26:46.560 --> 26:52.480]  they hope to just do it and bring it out in the open and just normalize it like it's
[26:52.480 --> 26:59.640]  no big deal with headlines like this tech giants who vow to tackle online hate speech
[26:59.640 --> 27:05.560]  within 24 hours is all in the TPP they say to stop terrorist but they just say to stop
[27:05.560 --> 27:11.720]  that you know we can't have people out there criticizing Muslims or anything because that's
[27:11.720 --> 27:17.040]  what makes them a taxi you've got to get rid of your speech and you've got to accept Islam
[27:17.040 --> 27:24.120]  and it says words quote directed against anyone over issues of race color or religion so if
[27:24.120 --> 27:30.600]  we say this London Guardian reporter that is a part African part Anglo I guess gay man
[27:30.600 --> 27:36.920]  there I'm using the proper word gay or I'll get kicked off the internet again how it starts
[27:36.920 --> 27:41.080]  with gay sounds reasonable now it's everything else now I don't say mother and father he
[27:41.080 --> 27:44.240]  says soon we'll get rid of the evil white people and everything will be fine and we'll
[27:44.240 --> 27:47.960]  just skip down the road happily that is the most racist out of control statement but
[27:47.960 --> 27:53.040]  usually they're gonna say this guy's racist oh I'm sorry he's black he's protected you're
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.760]  taking off the internet because you these are protected groups but they're not really
[27:57.760 --> 28:04.240]  protected they're just being used so let's go out to break with this warning from last
[28:04.240 --> 28:10.040]  year with Matt Drudge here in studio to come you thought Obamacare was shocking you thought
[28:10.040 --> 28:13.880]  some of these other decisions were shocking wait until these copyright laws work their
[28:13.880 --> 28:21.400]  way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking
[28:21.400 --> 28:27.040]  across the board then that will end for me fine I've had a hell of a run it's 20 years
[28:27.040 --> 28:31.280]  next year we're 20 years about now hell of a run I couldn't I couldn't have gone any
[28:31.280 --> 28:37.520]  further farther I feel completely I have gone as far out of the galaxy as I can on this
[28:37.520 --> 28:41.840]  I still want to stay out here but I've gone pretty damn far for what one individual can
[28:41.840 --> 28:48.040]  do in this culture but I'm talking about the future so I don't know why they've been successful
[28:48.040 --> 28:54.040]  in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these Facebooks and these tweets and these
[28:54.040 --> 29:00.240]  Instagrams these instas this is ghetto this is ghetto this is corporate they're taking
[29:00.240 --> 29:05.200]  your they taking your energy they're taking your energy and you're getting nothing a return
[29:05.200 --> 29:09.680]  nothing they're dumbing the language down Twitter's designed to reduce the language directly
[29:09.680 --> 29:15.480]  out of 1984 it's in shock right ultimately it's boring and the kids are always off to
[29:15.480 --> 29:20.120]  something new except for the something new is owned by the same freaking company or financed
[29:20.120 --> 29:25.400]  by the same banking system so I'm here to say and this is the reason why I came to see
[29:25.400 --> 29:31.400]  you Alex is you are one of the very few who are operating under this this under this theory
[29:31.400 --> 29:36.720]  to be an independent American and as in a big way if you're calling as media if you're
[29:36.720 --> 29:41.360]  calling is media fine if you're calling is sports whatever it is but you've got to be
[29:41.360 --> 29:48.360]  the greatest you can be now now and we're going to come back and play where he warned
[29:48.360 --> 29:51.640]  about the Supreme Court Justice coming to him and saying next year we're on the March

[33:21.520 --> 33:28.760]  from the military the fbi the cia who were led in on the plans in the 50s to bring in
[33:28.760 --> 33:34.160]  a world government destroy american sovereignty they went public they warned people they got
[33:34.160 --> 33:38.760]  attacked they got laughed at they got killed but it built a core of people that were aware
[33:38.760 --> 33:43.560]  of what was happening and the last 60 years we have tried to educate as many people as
[33:43.560 --> 33:49.680]  we can not just here but across the world and now we've got a fighting chance to defeat
[33:49.680 --> 33:55.360]  the world government project because the world government project is only the means
[33:55.360 --> 34:05.560]  to the end the end game is planetary eugenics planetary forced population reduction and
[34:05.560 --> 34:09.920]  many people say good there's too many folks i don't like standing in line you know to
[34:09.920 --> 34:16.200]  get my starbucks coffee you have starbucks and complex civilization and choices because
[34:16.200 --> 34:21.400]  of large human masses that's why you go to the cities but when you're in the cities it
[34:21.400 --> 34:28.560]  creates the illusion of overcrowding and the more prosperous the city there is the more
[34:28.560 --> 34:32.920]  overcrowded and dirty it is because there's more people and more opportunity and more
[34:32.920 --> 34:38.320]  energy but you go up in an airplane and you figure out that 90% of the land is not being
[34:38.320 --> 34:45.880]  used or more in places like north america now there are some areas in the south pacific
[34:45.880 --> 34:52.560]  where fathers are living off government welfare and having up to 20 children the children
[34:52.560 --> 34:58.560]  then basically become miscreant they get filled full of leftist globalist ideology worldwide
[34:58.560 --> 35:05.280]  and they get trans shipped into the west they have no culture and they then adopt cia produced
[35:05.280 --> 35:14.000]  gangster culture weaponized in 1986 in a government project partially declassified yes inner city
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.680]  black gangster culture didn't exist in the 60s and 70s it was completely manufactured
[35:20.680 --> 35:28.360]  weaponized put into media and now has been exported with a devastating effect white russians
[35:28.360 --> 35:36.200]  asianic chinese it doesn't matter what group it is arabs you go to brazil it's hip hop
[35:36.200 --> 35:43.000]  music gangster culture thugs about being scummy and dishonorable and and and just being horrible
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.760]  that was weaponized to bring down culture now you see the attacks on the father the attacks
[35:47.760 --> 35:53.900]  on the mother you see everything that's been beta tested in the inner city communities
[35:53.900 --> 36:02.080]  being used worldwide first tested in the laboratory then deployed just like you don't just think
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.560]  they shot black people up a syphilis do you they were just so sloppy about it in tuski

[42:28.880 --> 42:34.280]  people joined that force that is a force of looting and evil they don't want you unless
[42:34.280 --> 42:38.840]  you're corrupt and evil because then you would blow the whistle on the looting the un engages
[42:38.840 --> 42:45.320]  in oh nearly 46 million people are trapped in modern day slavery bloomberg reports but
[42:45.320 --> 42:49.760]  of course the un's helping run all that worldwide but every time you see the most gorgeous super
[42:49.760 --> 42:54.960]  model out on the street or at the mall she's wearing a world wildlife fund a unicef or
[42:54.960 --> 43:00.880]  a un shirt because super models are told you don't get the contract sweetheart unless you
[43:00.880 --> 43:05.360]  wear you in clothing and when you get asked what you support you support the end of the
[43:05.360 --> 43:15.760]  family the end of the patriarchy and the united nations and for children patriarchy rules
[43:15.760 --> 43:21.320]  the world to check your mail wide privilege and all over the country our reporters are
[43:21.320 --> 43:26.720]  there and weirdo white people run up and go you're not allowed to talk you're white you're
[43:26.720 --> 43:32.560]  a white male and they're white you look and they're all crazy they don't have jobs or
[43:32.560 --> 43:36.960]  they do it state jobs they're real dumb but they're on power trips their eyes are a glow
[43:36.960 --> 43:42.080]  it's their time to take over it's their time yes yes yes yes see they're going to be the
[43:42.080 --> 43:46.680]  new bosses even though there isn't some white male patriarchy unless you're in the mega
[43:46.680 --> 43:55.480]  corporations that are setting this up to have us all kill each other little powerless power
[43:55.480 --> 43:59.520]  hungry control freaks that can't even have a husband because they henpeck and harass
[43:59.520 --> 44:07.360]  men so bad men would rather be alone than with women now and that's a generalization
[44:07.360 --> 44:11.600]  but that's what's going on as they teach everyone scientifically how to collapse how to fall
[44:11.600 --> 44:18.040]  apart how to be nobody's and we told you they're coming words is quoted from the AP directed
[44:18.040 --> 44:24.520]  against anyone over issues of race color religion Facebook a year ago said if you disagree with
[44:24.520 --> 44:30.280]  someone just disagreeing could hurt their feelings we're going to ban you and that's
[44:30.280 --> 44:36.560]  what they do you send out the most mild information even and they're banning that and they're
[44:36.560 --> 44:41.040]  restricting that and people say well they're not going to info wars they've done it a bunch
[44:41.040 --> 44:44.360]  but we make a big deal about it put them on notice we're going to sue them they back off
[44:44.360 --> 44:48.920]  because they don't want to warn you you know I've used this story a lot it's an allegory
[44:48.920 --> 44:54.680]  of parable a parallel because it happened many times I'd be in the deer skin when I
[44:54.680 --> 44:58.120]  was like I started shooting deer and I was about seven you know then taking them back
[44:58.120 --> 45:02.600]  and gutting them shopping them up preparing on the average pretty gross animal cruelty
[45:02.600 --> 45:05.600]  you'll buy the meat and eat it but that's okay that's going out and being a real humans
[45:05.600 --> 45:10.800]  you know I want to just kill something no it's about turning on those genes those genetics
[45:10.800 --> 45:16.080]  flipping ritual switches killing your first deer and gutting it is the same thing as kissing
[45:16.080 --> 45:20.560]  your first girl or planting your first tomatoes something happens when you when you get the
[45:20.560 --> 45:24.160]  soil and plant for the first time you go on a night hike for the first time you get a
[45:24.160 --> 45:29.440]  real fight all of a sudden you just all these things switch on and it's like whoa it's next
[45:29.440 --> 45:34.320]  level but see they don't ever want you going next level the truth is life is like a video
[45:34.320 --> 45:38.680]  game folks you go up next level next level next level next level next level developing
[45:38.680 --> 45:42.760]  yourself they don't want you ever to have that they want to rest of development and
[45:42.760 --> 45:47.160]  so many times we'd be sitting there you know a little buck would come out first some dough
[45:47.160 --> 45:51.560]  would come out females my dad say well you want one of those you know that's that's better
[45:51.560 --> 45:56.200]  for cooking stew or I guess you want to get a rack to show off he goes well then I bet
[45:56.200 --> 46:00.520]  a little buck comes out here in a minute but let's wait and see because there'll be a bigger
[46:00.520 --> 46:04.240]  buck probably in there and if and if that little buck doesn't get shot he's going to
[46:04.240 --> 46:07.880]  come out and run him off and a couple times that wouldn't happen but a lot of the time
[46:07.880 --> 46:12.440]  it would my dad say see I heard him snorting back there like 200 yards away my dad was like
[46:12.440 --> 46:16.200]  just relax your eyes you're gonna see everything move it don't look for the animals just open
[46:16.200 --> 46:19.600]  your eyes this is in the woods with little clearance and I opened my eyes up and I could
[46:19.600 --> 46:26.080]  suddenly see all these different animals a badger a weasel crows and you know an eagle
[46:26.080 --> 46:31.280]  fly by it's going to hunter mode my dad said they're like basically relax he was almost
[46:31.280 --> 46:36.080]  hypnotize me that's just ancient male passing that down all being broken I haven't even
[46:36.080 --> 46:40.880]  given my son all that training you know and how to how to how to see different signs in
[46:40.880 --> 46:46.280]  the wind and how to hunt and how to fish and how to fight everything else and so all the
[46:46.280 --> 46:52.360]  sudden outcome the dough they're sitting there eating the oats plant the oats eating little
[46:52.360 --> 46:58.720]  green oats in the winter all of a sudden out comes that little buck don't take him out
[46:58.720 --> 47:03.200]  yet wait till the big one comes and then sure enough five minutes later he comes out runs
[47:03.200 --> 47:10.400]  them off boom shoot that big buck right there right there in the heart and that's what they're
[47:10.400 --> 47:14.160]  doing they're just holding back with everybody going don't take Jones out yet we want to
[47:14.160 --> 47:18.680]  get them all wait wait wait till we got them all in the news they don't want to raise alarms
[47:18.680 --> 47:21.920]  they want to take drugs down yet they'll take up they're going to wait till the economy drops
[47:21.920 --> 47:25.880]  ISIS hits there's terrorists taking action oh we got to shut the web off because the
[47:25.880 --> 47:30.120]  terrorists are using it to communicate they're using cell phones we just got hit by 200 cells
[47:30.120 --> 47:35.880]  in one day and the martial law comes in they put the radical jihadis down but say you don't
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.160]  have free speech anymore you cause them to do it and we're arresting other radicals that
[47:40.160 --> 47:45.320]  were anti-islamic and the sheep public will line up and say good arrest them shut their
[47:45.320 --> 47:51.640]  speech down that's what we want I have war game the enemy but I also have contacts in
[47:51.640 --> 47:56.840]  the military as high up as delta force you name it who concur with my analysis and this
[47:56.840 --> 48:02.320]  is exactly what's going on because my analysis is the analysis it's not like I came up with
[48:02.320 --> 48:06.560]  it and that's reality now anyone that studies this and knows the ball game can see it for
[48:06.560 --> 48:18.160]  themselves without hearing Alex Jones I'm just on target
[48:18.160 --> 48:22.880]  now I'm gonna stop right there and just let everybody know that we have one of the biggest
[48:22.880 --> 48:26.120]  specials we've ever engaged in and funding our operation is critical but more importantly

[54:38.120 --> 54:43.520]  his real culture they're destroying everybody's culture and replacing it with his globalist
[54:43.520 --> 54:50.880]  politically correct homogenized garbage they plan to use radical Islam as a bizarre authoritarian
[54:50.880 --> 54:55.240]  enforcer and I used to hear this 10 years ago from right-wingers and I would just roll
[54:55.240 --> 55:01.240]  my eyes and go you people are crazy yes they're doing a clash of civilizations yesterday stabilizing
[55:01.240 --> 55:06.240]  the Middle East yes that's wrong to do a lot of Muslims and Arabs and people send me constant
[55:06.240 --> 55:11.520]  emails going you used to not be anti-Islam why are you bashing us I'm explaining this to you again
[55:11.520 --> 55:15.920]  I was against the stabilizing your countries I'm against Saudi Arabia installing all these
[55:15.920 --> 55:20.640]  corrupt groups I'm against Wahhabism I was against the attack in Iraq because they didn't
[55:20.640 --> 55:26.880]  carry out 9-11 and now the whole place has been destabilized by design and they're putting
[55:26.880 --> 55:32.040]  radicals in charge and bringing them in and these are real people real Sunni Wahhabists
[55:32.040 --> 55:37.000]  that kill the non-radical Muslims around them and are taking over Islam whether it was bad
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.760]  before good before or whatever it's being radicalized it's dangerous now the jihadi
[55:42.760 --> 55:50.080]  threat is real and the Western governments at the top plan to let them attack and they're
[55:50.080 --> 55:55.080]  going to take our liberties and freedoms the process I mean I had Tim Kennedy who's involved
[55:55.080 --> 55:58.440]  the highest level national security stuff and he hasn't told me all that I know that
[55:58.440 --> 56:02.520]  separately and he was concurring saying yes that's their plan I had him studio last week
[56:03.400 --> 56:08.840]  but I don't need to talk to people in Delta Force to know all that I can sit here and tell you
[56:08.840 --> 56:15.640]  right now ladies and gentlemen the globalist mean business they didn't put 50 billion dollars of
[56:15.640 --> 56:23.480]  internet kill switch in that's conservative the last 15 years to play games okay it's here
[56:23.480 --> 56:30.200]  and they need us to just not be aware of it like TPP and all those other crap but let's play Matt
[56:30.200 --> 56:34.840]  drudge again talking about the Supreme Court Justice warning him a year ago face to face
[56:34.840 --> 56:39.240]  they're coming in 2016 for the free speech and look all over the world it's happening because
[56:39.240 --> 56:44.440]  they have this on timetables because next year folks I'm sure of it now the real global meltdown
[56:44.440 --> 56:48.520]  is going to happen I believe it's already here in most areas of the world but still in isolated
[56:48.520 --> 56:53.800]  pockets the US is doing okay the bottom is falling out I don't want that to happen some people say
[56:53.800 --> 57:00.200]  well be more optimistic maybe it won't mathematically it's impossible it's like an 89 year old guy
[57:00.200 --> 57:04.120]  who's had 15 heart attacks he's going to have a new one at some point the heart's rotten it's going
[57:04.120 --> 57:08.920]  to blow into 10 pieces and I'm just here trying to tell folks they're going to use the crisis
[57:08.920 --> 57:13.880]  trying to take all of our freedoms here's the clip I had a supreme court justice tell me to my face
[57:13.880 --> 57:20.120]  it's over for me said Matt it's over for you they've got the votes now to enforce copyright law
[57:20.120 --> 57:23.800]  you're out of there they're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines
[57:24.680 --> 57:30.280]  to have a supreme court justice say that to my face that it's over they've got the votes
[57:30.280 --> 57:37.560]  which means time is limited you know I want to take that whole interview and it was an excellent
[57:37.560 --> 57:41.880]  interview but you know I jumped in quite a bit because it was a surprise visit so I was on a
[57:41.880 --> 57:46.600]  better job I could have been prepared but it was it was fun to have drugs pop back in uh and
[57:47.720 --> 57:51.080]  we need to take that and edit it down like 15 minutes and air that I think all the time or
[57:51.080 --> 57:54.200]  have a bunch of intros and outros that we're talking about because he had new interviews
[57:54.200 --> 58:00.440]  for every five years or so and but again time is compressed I know drudge is listening I think
[58:00.440 --> 58:03.560]  drudge should probably be heard from a little bit more because he kind of is the symbol of free
[58:03.560 --> 58:08.680]  internet and he links to mainstream government documents alternative grassroots stuff the point
[58:08.680 --> 58:14.040]  is it's a different filter of a guy that's a populist and a patriot instead of Mark Zuckerberg
[58:14.040 --> 58:19.720]  the king of facebook and his filter that's telling you obama's god and free speech is bad and let's
[58:19.720 --> 58:24.680]  get rid of our borders and let's bring jihadis in and they are coming and saying is what they're

[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.200]  national number but they have regional numbers that are for your region and i'm going to put it
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.040]  on air when they join us coming up and just say i've called fbi before on air and people don't
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.840]  believe actually get fbi agents on the phone it's there and talk to them we're like that's fake

[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:33.880]  well i'm no hero here but if i see something i'm supposed to say something right
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.120]  oh they want you to report the neighbor you saw cleaning a deer in their garage
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.160]  i see that article every few months because there's a suburbs drawn to the countryside
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:51.880]  it's just always the same story there'll be some old veteran outside his trailer on some 40 acres
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:58.360]  he's had it's deer season and he'll be right by the road with you know a tree with a deer hauled
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:03.160]  up in it gutting it and the californians have moved in it's always californians are and they
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.760]  see the guy got the deer and they call the cops and then the cops don't do anything but then animal
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:14.040]  cruelty comes and then they get arrested because it freaks animal cruelty out to see a deer hanging
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.520]  up you're like that didn't happen look up for yourself police called on man cleaning deer
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:25.000]  here you see it all the time and that's just the alieness of the general public and by alien i mean
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:34.440]  alien from normal human activity my dad's dad had been in construction oil you know drilling
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.640]  and they've been in county government and stuff like that he was a smart guy you know had a college
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:45.640]  degree in agriculture from a and m and engineering going from memory the point is is that i was able
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:53.160]  to stories that he would grab a shotgun and go out and shoot birds for 15 minutes on the back 40
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.560]  literally a couple hundred acres out front like 40 something acres out back and
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.800]  shoot a squirrel in the yard and come in and cut him up in a matter of like three minutes
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.240]  he could skin a squirrel so fast he'd nail their feet down just rip the fur off cook it chop it up
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:17.320]  throw it in a skillet uh tear the breast out of the quail or out of the dove no matter what time
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:26.440]  of year it was boom throw it right in there and just put some toast in there and in an hour 45
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:31.640]  minutes he'd have a nice lunch cooked and just bam on the table and everybody my grandma was even
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:38.440]  better cooked but i mean he would just fix like tractors and combines with pieces of rubber band
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:46.600]  and tin cans and weld and electricity and just my dad was still like the clowns are like a spider
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:52.520]  just fixing everything like a robot or something me i'm like oh and i'm like super good at changing
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:57.000]  tires and fixing stuff compared to the average man today i mean i can roof a house and i can do basic
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.840]  plumbing and i can fix some things people when they see me they go i didn't know you could do that
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.440]  like you're one of the other wives like because i'm too busy fighting new world order calling a handyman
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:14.520]  but oh i can do it but compared to the average person i've got some skills but and i talk about
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:22.200]  this all the time it's just that we are so domesticated and then you go and you
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:30.840]  talk to the average trendy it isn't about race it isn't about color it isn't about religion
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.160]  you go to san diego you go to la you go to downtown austin you go to trendy areas the more

[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:17.640]  of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:24.680]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:30.600]  there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:37.000]  plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death

[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:56.600]  body discover why antroplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to take our bodies back

[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:45.080]  i am truly overwhelmed right now news wise i've covered a lot of it last hour but i've probably
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:51.400]  got 90% out of god too and i need to get to it uh earlier this morning i was watching like an hour
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:56.280]  long press conference with donald trump giving a bunch of money to veterans groups
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:06.520]  and they they they had the reporters just chewing him out bitching him out demanding details of this
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.360]  or that or where the money came from he's like i'm having a press conference about giving veterans
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:17.640]  money i'm not getting to that you can look it up later and they just turn everything into a controversy
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:26.040]  and there's another bill marcliffe where he has a hypnotist on to talk about how donald
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:32.440]  trump is hypnotizing people and basically using neuro linguistic programming you know i love how
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:40.840]  every wannabe genius out there thinks that everyone is using neuro linguistic programming
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:46.040]  neuro linguistic programming uh people kept telling me i was doing it and so i went and
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:52.760]  read a book about it like five years ago i watched some videos about it and it's mainly hype okay
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:10:01.800]  okay but people that are talented speakers are naturally going to do things that
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:12.440]  political scientists and advertising scientists are going to codify into some type of language
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:22.280]  or nomenclature but let me tell you what cell stuff is being genuine and being off the cuff
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:30.360]  and being real hillary does engage in neuro linguistic programming it's dumbed down it's
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:34.520]  mindless and it targets people that are already in a trance basically
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:41.720]  but it's the tv flicker rate it's the fluoride in the water it's the culture it's the sedentary
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:52.760]  nature that prepares the ground for neuro linguistic techniques to take hold and if you
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:57.240]  want to dumb down neuro linguistic programming or the voice as frank herbert would call it
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:05.240]  you would play the clip the famous clip from episode four star wars
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:13.640]  how long you have these droids i don't know three or four seasons these aren't the droids you're
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:18.120]  looking for you can move along these aren't the droids we're looking for you can move along
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:28.120]  that's an exaggerated example of that so when you listen to mpr that is a project of the
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:35.480]  Rockefeller and annenberg project of the defense department and the whole thing is about making
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:40.600]  you think you're intellectual controlling the left and putting them in a sedate calm
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:49.080]  trance fashion i have been told by mpr when i've been on multiple national interviews
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.000]  later they call back to oh we're not airing your interview they said your voice was too aggressive
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:02.520]  and too raspy and too upsetting too awakening too awakening they'd use that word they said
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:09.480]  just too upsetting and and and they'd ask me can you just calm down and just slow down because with
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:20.040]  them it was all about that project it's about capturing people everything is calm everything
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:30.600]  is good i don't know why donald trump acts like that i don't know why he doesn't like women
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:39.080]  all i do know is we're going to win that's Hillary clinton
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:51.160]  and obama is clearly trained in a in a cadence and and trying to it's fake it isn't as powerful as
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.880]  taking the gloves off real deal sometimes i'm gibbering 100 miles an hour sometimes i'm talking
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:01.160]  slow it's what i'm feeling what i'm thinking and your subconscious mind is a thousand times more
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:09.400]  sophisticated and and is able to read what's genuine versus what's fake but these people
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:17.400]  are sociopaths and psychopaths and they're so ungenuine so disingenuous that you study sociopaths
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.640]  and psychopaths because they're not real they're like i've got a little puppy kid get in the car
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:26.680]  they're all about smiley and dressing non-threatening oh hi i brought you some presents oh hi we're
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:31.640]  friends i've always learned now when a sociopath's around they do all this oh we're but you look you
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:40.120]  can tell it's fake and it's overdone and they come and they bring you gifts and they do you know
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:43.720]  internet videos with you know with muppets how they're friendly and how they're nice and how
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:50.040]  they're here to help because they don't know how to be real so they're trying to study how to be
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.160]  genuine and then folks see something genuine and they say well that looks like neuro linguistic
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.160]  programming to me and that's just because you haven't been around anything genuine or you get
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:05.640]  around the general public is huh you know how to talk whatever i don't care nobody hates me i'm on
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:11.480]  world yeah so much the public is so beaten down they just want to get their own little click
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.720]  with a few people under them so they can be the boss and so they can have the power because they
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:21.720]  don't have the power the whole world was built so they never had rites of passage never had rituals
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:27.640]  never had ways to do a sin to feminine power male power
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.800]  i mean you take people you put them through trials and tribulations and you put them through
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:39.560]  cultural rituals that are natural and wholesome i could take the weakest person today and you
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.760]  you take them at birth and put them through real ritual they'll be an incredible person
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.560]  but you've got to have a ritual you're not going to hear this any book folks by the way
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:52.280]  i know this i've experienced you have to have a ritual you have to have trials of passage
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:59.080]  to activate the race memories the race consciousness and to activate the sixth sense and by the way
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:06.360]  down at ut psychology department that's all they work on is the intuitive and the innate and the
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.600]  sixth sense they know it they're obsessed with it and they're just busy trying to keep everybody
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:21.480]  else in programmed mob psychology and controlled they know they know that people are psychic they
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:28.040]  know they know it folks it's all been proven now they'll put out con artists on tv you know that
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.440]  with a caribbean accent they're telling you that you know you call in i will tell you your future
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.440]  they'll just tell you some great future that's all a bunch of hype and that's taking things that
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:41.720]  people innately know are there and then lying about it and claiming that this person has
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.200]  50 times the innate power that let's say a person that powerfully intuitive would have
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.440]  here's what i'm getting at to the so-called elite you're going to destroy everybody you're
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.200]  going to destroy the planet where you're going won't work you're not going to merge with machines
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.640]  and become gods get off your crazy power trips you have really got to transcend this for yourself
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.720]  to transcend you are not going to dump everybody down and go to the next level that is not how the
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:21.160]  universe works just at a mathematical level mathematical cultural algorithm measurement
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:25.320]  quantified first to put into popular culture by isek azamot
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:33.240]  in his foundation series you are not which was obviously what they were shooting for and what
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:36.840]  they were planning for even 50 years before they were just putting into a cosmology there to roll
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.200]  out the public where they have computers hooked into everything they can predict the future
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.640]  off mass movements they now have that
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:51.080]  and so all this other stuff is just a side issue once you once you fully grasp that
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.840]  that you cannot dumb the public down to make them manageable and directable with stimuli and say
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:06.120]  they have no soul and say they have no destiny and say they have no innate free will without it
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:15.400]  creating a group consciousness shift that will also destroy your consciousness
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:24.280]  and that's very simple to understand you create a interdimensional fourth and fifth
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:32.760]  dimension plane and program that with a smart grid an extermination dumb grid and you put
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:45.800]  that into place you are going to create an evil paradigm and that just means it's destructive
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:51.560]  it doesn't grow it's not healthy it's not good and it's like a black hole it gets worse and worse
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:18:01.000]  as you feed more into it it will demand everything it will take everything down
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.360]  to absolute zero and will accelerate everything in a pyramidal structure into absolute tyranny
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.400]  and this is just so simple and and and the establishment says they understand this but
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:23.560]  they don't follow it because they want to have their next level of managers who meanwhile going
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:27.800]  along with this project going it's sure ugly it's sure dangerous it sure looks bad they go
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:32.680]  it's for the greater good we must come through this great time of testing first well you're not
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:40.040]  the ones testing humanity playing god you're delusional you're not providing stimuli that
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:47.560]  makes us stronger you're providing twisted stimuli that makes us adapt to being enslaved and destroyed
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:57.880]  look at the fruits of this tree it's stinking it's rotten it's poisonous it's ugly it's bad it's
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:04.120]  diseased and you're planting more of these trees and taking resources to grow this culture of darkness
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:12.760]  because the truth is only evil twisted people who've fallen to complete absolute evil would
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.720]  want to build something like this and you've only lied to yourselves about what you're really
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:23.160]  building and who you are deep inside and i'm speaking to the next echelon level right below
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:27.960]  the actual controllers when you get to the controllers they know full well what they're
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:37.640]  doing and are practitioners of dark art so evil i don't even want to imagine them
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:50.600]  we'll be back i'm alex joe your host hell is being built on earth yes humans can dream and
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:55.000]  build anything and our elites are very wicked in question they're building something very ugly
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.720]  and something very scary free humanity must rally against it now
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:07.400]  here's dr paul meyer christian psychiatrist author of 85 books and founder of the national

[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:46.200]  a monday edition now getting into the dumbing down to the public this is essential that there
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:51.000]  be no culture in the united states are in europe then they bring in folks from the third world
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:57.240]  and they take the trashiest nature of nationalism that all countries have
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:05.240]  and they say that that's the culture and mexico has a culture they're trying to force feet on
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:10.280]  mexico most mexicans i've met or talked to are more sophisticated than that and i'm literally
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.600]  are more important than the average american just a fact on average but there's a large contingent
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:20.680]  that i guess feel isolated don't feel part of things generally an area is totally dominated
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:26.520]  that are probably 90 of spanish like areas of la where a real culture is kicking in of just bring
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:32.600]  down america kill donald trump all whites are evil it's really terrible and it's very very sad we
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:37.160]  also see the spanish and black community killing each other at even higher rates so it's tribalism
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:43.000]  you see this when the public has been basically dumbed down and there's a video up on drudgereport.com
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.400]  it's it's a paul joseph watch an article mexican parents train three-year-old girl to say we have
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:54.760]  to kill donald trump mother and father encourage toddler to make death threats against presidential
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:59.160]  candidate shock video footage shows mexican immigrant parents encouraging the three-year-old
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:04.680]  daughter repeatedly say we have to kill donald trump and this is just so sad this is going on
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:10.280]  here's a club of it you're about to see this poor three-year-old mexican girl being brainwashed
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:16.600]  by her parents her mother and her father into saying that she should kill donald trump i'm
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.320]  blurring the child's face for her own privacy because i don't want her picture to be plastered
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:27.400]  all over the internet the parents of course didn't give her that respect not only encouraging her to
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:33.080]  say such despicable things but recording the video and posting it on the internet for the whole
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:40.440]  world to watch have a look we're going to kill donald trump oh is that a fact why are we going
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:47.000]  to kill donald trump because she's there that's right you can hear the mother say that's right
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.560]  so this isn't just some kid just mouthing off and the parents thinking it's cute they are actively

[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:39.160]  so it's so important to support the broadcast and to know they've announced a massive censorship
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:44.840]  in europe with the big facebook twitter google apple all together saying we're not going to
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.920]  let you criticize anybody if you're conservative libertarian we're going to shut you down germany
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.640]  already arrests you and now zuckerberg wants to do that here and has been restricting trump and
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.680]  drudge and info wars everybody else so it's on but they're trying to restrict us because they've
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:05.560]  been quietly doing it forever it hasn't worked we are taking the planet back hispanics we have our
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:11.000]  reporters all over the country are like half the people i mean i said they're in a raw video of
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.080]  like 30 minutes people going into a trump rally half of them are hispanic with hispanics with
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:19.240]  mexican flags spitting at them screaming at them i'm gonna do a special report on that by the way
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.320]  because you have all the photos we've showed it and the hispanic americans are just laughing at them
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:28.120]  and they're just laughing at them because you know they're dressed nice they want to have a
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:34.280]  prosperous country they care about this nation they they they want that dream that's why a lot of them
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:39.480]  left mexico and they're being spit on by gangbangers with mexican flags with zit face white kids
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:45.080]  hopping around spitting thank god we're not with these people folks and the good news is the hoax
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:50.280]  that trumps anti-woman or anti-hispanic whatever is collapsing they're panicking so now more than

[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:08.280]  and stuff and that's a possibility during some islamic ted offensive and crisis they say they'll
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:13.720]  do it just like in europe they shut off the internet they shut off the patris communication
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:18.280]  claiming it's to stop radical islam they brought in so sign up at info wars dot com
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:22.120]  forward slash newsletter because even with an internet kill switch we can still get to you via

[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:37.240]  roger stone in his uh war room in florida inside the battle for the republic outside the trump
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:42.440]  campaign but one of his top advisors always giving us key intel on so many fronts thank you for joining
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:48.600]  us sir Alex it's great to be here and it's an exciting time to be an american it is okay you've
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:53.240]  got the floor my friend what is front and center i know you sent us this article uh the big casino
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:38:00.520]  owner adelson aids in talks to set up pro trump super PAC yeah i think it's very important to
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:05.320]  recognize that hillary clinton according to the most recent federal election commission reports
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:13.240]  has raised about 85 000 dollars in super PAC money and has as much as 45.8 on hand today
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:20.920]  and there's more where that came from so uh trump of course would be a foolish to unilaterally
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:28.520]  disarm but first he must raise upwards of a billion dollars through the republican party
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:35.320]  victory fund now the very first fundraiser was very successful netted about six million dollars
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:42.200]  at the home of tom barrick a business man who runs a real estate opportunity fund who's a
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:50.360]  close personal friend of donald's uh and uh that is that's good but if you go do the math the party
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:58.040]  apparatus is going to have to raise that much every day on average and of course donald trump
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:06.600]  himself cannot do that many events so he has to campaign uh there there is a going to be a very
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:14.520]  interesting um uh development we have to watch fundraising carefully because it is crucial uh
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:21.800]  now kori luandowski uh is in charge as i understand it of the uh newly announced fundraising operation
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:28.680]  it is absolutely clear that like the clinton campaign the trump campaign is going to need to
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:37.080]  be augmented with super PACs we have talked on this program about the problems with great america
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:44.680]  PAC the financial irregularities the longtime record of ed rollins the chairman as an anti
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:52.680]  trump antagonist and now his ties to tenet strategy which is the clinton's i believe that
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:40:00.680]  good old ed is a quisling and this is a sabotage operation there is a group called the committee
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:08.040]  for american sovereignty a pro trump pac with an august committee i have sent them a thousand
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:15.480]  dollars personally i know this fellow dug watts who runs it he is a competent practitioner of
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:21.960]  political communications and he is a real life reagan republican uh so i've sent him a thousand
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:29.720]  dollars uh from myself uh but the news today really is that the uh the billionaire sheldon
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:36.600]  adelson who has pledged uh according to politico a hundred million dollars to the trump campaign
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:44.520]  uh will probably fund neither of these entities and is in talks with a new PAC what this story
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:50.760]  doesn't tell you is that among those political professionals that they're in discussion with
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:41:01.080]  is carl rove yes carl rove is back in the house rove has been pitching adelson to let him control
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:09.080]  the hundred million dollars that is to help trump now i don't need to tell you that carl rove has
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:16.280]  done nothing but belittle attack uh and underestimate donald trump by the way he lives right here in
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:23.240]  austin and i'm just going to leave it at that that i happen to talk to a um political person
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:29.880]  who's on record works with rove some and he said look i'm he's saying you got to get behind trump
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:36.120]  this is last week and he just laughed and said no way so i know last week he was saying he's
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:41.800]  going to get trump so that's the key intel for you well here's the other key point and that is
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:48.360]  rince previs uh and his friends at the republican national committee would also like to send 30
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:56.680]  million dollars worth of data analytical work to the data vault owned by carl rove and others so
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:04.680]  so carl uh is now trying to profiteer it is not just that he is a long time antagonist and critic
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:08.840]  of pretty famously has gobbled up most of the tea party money he's a he's a hated creature
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.800]  and achieved nothing the point is he lost we lost the white house under carl we lost both
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:20.440]  houses of the congress he then in 2012 and the previous cycle had unlimited money from mega
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:27.480]  wealthy donors he's a loser he cannot help donald trump he doesn't know how he didn't see the trump
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:35.960]  revolution coming he doesn't understand the new dynamics uh so uh if if if carl roves ends up getting
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:42.840]  wealthy off the candidacy of donald trump through the good graces of shelton adelson or otherwise
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:47.800]  that would be a that would be a tragic tragic thing well sure the mainstream media is saying look
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:55.400]  bush senior and and jeb and and former president bush w and mitt romney and others and and and the
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:01.400]  keening five john mccain they're not going to be at the convention oh it's so terrible thank god
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:05.800]  thank god these horrible warmongering demons that hate trump because he doesn't want to have
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:11.720]  war with russia and war with china thank god and doesn't want to let radical muslims in thank god
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:17.800]  if they were endorsing him i would have some serious problems with trump well but again that
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:23.960]  doesn't stop their quisling their running dog lackey from trying to cash in on a candidacy that
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:28.600]  sure but isn't that key intel that just last week he was running his mouth against trump
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:33.960]  to to high powered republicans here in town uh and that uh when they were pressuring him
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:40.040]  and so that just shows where he said he just wants to take trump money he is very definitely uh uh
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:46.680]  in the mix here talking to adelson talking to some around trump we have to remember he is not a
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:53.400]  friend he is uh he is the architect of many of the failed globalist policies that are destroying
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:59.240]  you and i in our audience are basically paul reveres uh trying to help trump not be infiltrated
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:04.120]  because uh of the fact that there are these political operatives out there uh look i don't
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:10.680]  trump's a very smart guy and he knows that carl rove is not his friend but he's out campaigning
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:18.680]  every day he's counting on his his campaign apparatus to do everything legal uh to ensure
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:26.040]  that uh they raise as much money as they can super pack world is a different place and there are
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:33.000]  hucksters in the market like roland's uh and his silent partner jesse benton the convicted
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:39.080]  felon who destroyed ron's paul's campaign and then ran paul's campaign uh but i wouldn't put a
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:44.600]  dollar there if you really want to help trump uh then i would say either give directly to the
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:50.360]  trump campaign give to the victory fund of the republican national committee or look at these
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:55.640]  other super packs and determine which one has low overhead competent people who know what they're
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:58.520]  doing sure because heller is going to be getting the big goldman sacks money and everything it's
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:03.400]  up to the grassroots to be able to do this because trump is such a grassroots organization has taken
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.680]  you know no money so far now it's starting to because it's like saying you're going to go to
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:11.320]  space without oxygen he's got to have the oxygen tanks folks it's got to happen if people are
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:16.920]  serious about winning but benedict luandowski i mean kori luandowski was an arnold luandowski
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:22.920]  all i know is what's his name again i mean i i don't have a a dog in the fight i think i think
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:29.320]  you're referring to louis corandowski and anyway louis uh said again on fox this weekend that he
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:36.280]  was in charge of vetting uh the vice presidential candidates nobody active in the campaign tells
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:44.040]  me that that is the case i do know ab culvahouse very able lawyer worked for ronald reagan uh
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:49.720]  who has been brought in to work on this process but let me just put let me get to the bottom line
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:57.720]  my confidence is in trump i know that the that the establishment republicans are pushing uh
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.200]  quarker and others may be pushing newt gingrich yeah let's talk we're talking vp now let's get
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:12.200]  into that exactly i'm putting my entire confidence in trump he knows above all that whoever he selects
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:19.080]  must be somebody who is at one with him on the major issues facing the country uh and therefore
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:25.400]  the chance of him taking someone out of the establishment someone who would make trump uh
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:33.000]  a uh an assassination target for some some who would uh or others who would seek to
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.560]  enter his administration in order to co-opt it trump is way too smart for that he will pick somebody
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:44.920]  who is a nationalist and entirely loyal to the president so i'm not worried about some of the
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:50.680]  names i hear my friends uh in the liberty movement and in the republican party email me every day
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:55.320]  they say oh god sure well let me throw out a couple here please not this one please not that one
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:01.480]  what about a senator sessions i like jeff sessions i've known jeff sessions uh since he was in the
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:06.760]  alabama young republicans and i was running for young republican national chairman he is a fine
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:14.040]  individual he's an excellent lawyer he was a great judge he would be a great vice president and he was
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:22.040]  the first man uh in the congress to endorse donald trump and i hope that sessions is on the list
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:29.320]  there are other fine people i like shelly uh more capito the u.s senator from new from uh west
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:37.720]  virginia tough experienced not a globalist uh there are i like general mike flinn uh as a
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:44.120]  outside the box possibility all i know is that only donald trump knows what the real short list is
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:49.080]  that that those in the liberty yes roger we know you don't know the short list i don't know no look
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:54.920]  i don't think the short list is probably knowing trump as i do i think the short list is probably
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:48:00.680]  changing i think he is holding this very much to himself i think he floats certain names to others
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:04.680]  i've watched the body language and everything else and i can tell you right now just watching
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.560]  television when he's around sessions the way trump acts he really likes sessions and i think sessions
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:15.800]  is a good choice i think they have they have a great chemistry but but i look i again trump is
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:21.800]  going to uh make this decision he's going to make it uh with some fanfare and with some buildup because
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:27.080]  he realizes better than anyone else that this is a great news story and again it's going to generate
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:32.200]  great attention and i suspect people are going to drop on and off the list i doubt that he's made
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.920]  a final decision i don't think he knows who he wants today i'm sure he's leaning one way or another
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:40.040]  sure but anytime well bottom line i want to go to a few phone calls you're going to be
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:43.400]  in here with us for an hour and a half live in city of friday really gracious for you to come to the
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:48.280]  town uh but before we go any further just just briefly because folks are listening but what is
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:53.080]  the best pack that that it's actually promoting trump and the constitution and and where the money
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:59.000]  actually gets there uh for folks in your view i have uh given a contribution to the committee for
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:06.200]  american sovereignty uh and you can find them online uh they have put together a list of uh
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:13.880]  of retired military officers including uh general mackinirney uh a former executive with the trump
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:21.080]  organization nick ribbis long time president of uh the trump hotels and casino resorts uh
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:27.240]  former congressman william hendon a number of state uh legislators it is a very august
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:33.640]  phyllis schlafly is on the committee for example uh there it is uh these are fine folks i am not
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:37.800]  working for them i understand you you're simply trying to get trump and albus and your first
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:41.960]  amendment but i know that they will not steal the money and i know they will use the money
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:47.560]  either to register new trump voters or to fend off the attacks of hillary clevin and what's the
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:54.360]  website for that it is uh the uh committee for american sovereignty dot com i believe yeah man
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:57.800]  we'll check and put it on screen it's on screen there folks there you go because i there's so many
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:01.480]  grips out there that you've said we're a fraud and then people get indicted i mean you really are
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.840]  giving us accurate information here we're going to skip this network break this is so important
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:09.800]  i want to be able to take calls before we've got to leave us but just watching today the story's up
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:17.960]  on info wars dot com trump whips press over charitable donations to vets that's a good
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:22.040]  handle but i'd say blast i mean he just blasted him don salazar turned up this article quickly
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:26.360]  i will say that the press should be ashamed of themselves i couldn't pull myself away from this
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:29.800]  press conference i'm gonna play some clips coming up at the bottom of the hour i've got some guests
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:33.880]  popping in but man just trying to even get money to vets they attack him they just can't
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:39.480]  let him look like he's doing anything good it's so sick uh when these are the people that say
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:44.120]  nothing about the don't treat list that we know our military's been under for six years with obama
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:49.560]  obama is killing the vets these people cover up for it cover up for hillary and or brian williams
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:54.840]  stories about sniper fire then they go out for donald trump me what a sick filthy group of people
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:00.840]  well hillary clinton said very recently that the problems in our va hospital system are not widespread
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:08.520]  what planet is this woman living on in in arizona alone where the ranking republican on the veteran
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:15.560]  affairs committee senator john mccain lives over 600 people died waiting for medical care in the
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:19.800]  vio biggs was been blown up and armored vehicles repeatedly shrapnel shot you name he coughs up
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:25.400]  blood all the place he's got all these medical issues he can't that he's been there 30 something
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:30.600]  times and they just each time say come back come back come back till he gave up one of my cousins
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:38.200]  two terms in vietnam a purple heart winner is told that he makes too much out of his meager
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:42.840]  retirement and therefore he's not eligible for treatment yeah that's the new thing that's the
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:50.520]  new thing it's just it's just insane so it's me it's means testing for means testing for veterans
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:55.640]  but not for welfare reception i was reading uh in the hill newspaper last week the average
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:52:03.160]  illegal it's 17 000 plus dollars in welfare uh the the quote migrants get even more than an actual
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:09.160]  social security recipient that's paid into it as a citizen who is running this country well i think
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:13.480]  that's all going to change under a president trump let's go to your questions because i love this part
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:17.080]  of the absolute we're gonna go to phone calls right now we're going to go to in fact you did
[01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:21.720]  that great reddit thing it was so popular anymore of those i'm gonna do one later this week um let's
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:27.320]  go ahead and we guys pull that screen down i can't read there sorry i can't see the collars there on
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:32.360]  screen again we're talking to roger stone uh right now i'm out with shones in full wars dot com is my
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:41.880]  website stonezone.com uh is his website let's go ahead and take a call uh from rob and canada you're
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:51.640]  on the air go ahead hey alex how are you good hey roger question for you what's uh what are your
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:58.200]  thoughts on these continual rumors you know by bill crystal and the neocons to bring some third party
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:02.680]  candidate in to you know just kind of well they said they're doing it they said they're preparing it
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:08.920]  yeah well i think it's a bit of a misnomer first of all it's recognized that there's probably no third
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:15.720]  party nomination available to a new candidate can't get on the ballot the libertarians nominated their
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:22.760]  ticket uh this weekend my friend governor gary johnson uh and governor bill weld uh and uh the
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:28.520]  greens are not going to nominate somebody copicetic to uh to bill crystal so what bill crystal is
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:36.360]  really talking about is an independent third candidacy the requirements in most states are
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:41.080]  actually even more rigorous in terms of valid signatures i mean we know it's a fraud so so what's
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:47.000]  the point of it i i don't really understand look i i like bill crystal we disagree on everything
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:53.320]  he is a dastardly neocon but he's charming company uh he voted you know he was the supporter of
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:59.480]  ubert humphrey he's not my political cup of tea but he's a fine fellow this is folly i don't know
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:03.160]  what this is about sure well you're being a gentleman let's get back to johnson has been a guest
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:06.920]  probably 20 times here a good governor i like him overall you i think you didn't you run his campaign
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:11.640]  once i worked very closely with okay okay so but i mean let's let's be honest he stands up about
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:17.000]  trumpeted true he's acting nasty and and he's trying to spoil this thing get the libertarians to
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.600]  hand this to hillary so let's take the gloves off on mr johnson you know the truth of the matter is
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:30.840]  that if bill weld and gary johnson run the right campaign for them uh which is to be uh fiscally
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:39.880]  conservative and conservative on defense but to be socially liberal on marijuana uh in civil liberties
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:46.280]  they will just as johnson did four years ago take pretty evenly from hillary clinton and uh
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:51.880]  and donald trump so don't buy this whole sure but he's kind of running on a trump bashing platform
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:57.320]  but i have seen gary's comments i don't think that that's productive but i also can't presume to tell
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:01.800]  him how to he's going to destroy himself a little with the real libertarian movement if he does that
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.640]  i think you should watch it let's take another call al in new jersey you're on the air go ahead
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:13.000]  with roger stone hey alex and roger guys doing a great job list and a very quick suggestion why
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.440]  don't we bring up with lord moccain and donald trump a discussion on a global warming so we
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:23.560]  could smack bernie space and hillary's because they'd be trying to spoil it trump should hammer
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:27.640]  turning our power plants on and how they're sabotaging america and now china opens three a
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:31.880]  week we shut down three a week i think he's hit that some i think that's a key for him to hammer
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:39.480]  on roger i don't necessarily disagree but in all honesty climate change is one of those issues the
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:48.600]  left tries to use to disqualify trump and based on the the polling that i have seen it is not one
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:55.720]  of the driving issues of this election our economy is a driving issue immigration guns right immigration
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:02.920]  is a driving issue our foreign policy is a driving issue and our trade policy and its connection to
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:09.960]  jobs is a driving issue i think trump can hold his own on the climate change issue but frankly i
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:15.240]  want to look for areas where we have commonality with bernie right now rather than we want to get
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:20.360]  bernie folks once he drops out we need a third we need a third of those votes for donald trump
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:24.360]  to win all right i'll take a few more calls here you've got to go and in a moment but but
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:29.400]  we've seen him as he takes the gloves off and really you know goes with your book and your research
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:33.560]  on the raping and the rest of it and the death's been fostered that's when he starts surging in
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:37.960]  polls so hopefully he's a smart guy i know he is he's getting the advice from you and others to
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:44.440]  get even more hardcore well look he's a brawler he's a fighter nobody's putting words in his
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:51.560]  mouth he has a broad cross section of advisors in the sense that he consults many many friends
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:57.000]  and he's always asking for people's opinions but at the end of the day i hate to steal a phrase
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:02.440]  from uh george w bush but trump is the decider uh and what you see is what you get the fact that
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:07.880]  he's not a confection that he's not a phony that he's not politically correct sure that's what
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:10.760]  folks see real quick robert in michigan you're on the air with roger stone
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:19.960]  hey alex hey mr stone how you doing good good go ahead robert that's good uh real quick um this
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:26.440]  question is stone regarding mr trump's um agenda um as far as in my opinion i think you know
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:31.080]  in order for him to win you know he can take away some of the african-american
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:35.800]  votes from hillary because 90 of african-americans for some reason you know or whole heart is a
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:41.640]  democratic party regardless how egregious they are but if he can get like 20 out of that base
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:46.680]  you know i think he has a smooth victory to uh i agree shouldn't he go all in for the african-american
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:51.720]  vote absolutely uh there's no question first of all the clintons have done nothing for the
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:56.840]  african-american community the reason so many young african-american men are incarcerated today
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:01.560]  for possession of small amounts of drugs is because of the policies of bill clinton and then
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:06.360]  and then she decries it acting like he didn't do it right and then but she called black people
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:11.800]  super predators and she said they needed to be brought to heal bill clinton told ted kennedy

[02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:16.280]  more minutes with roger stone then we've got a marine corps colonel coming on along with
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:21.800]  tosh plumbing to expose ongoing fast and furious guns through mexico to isis and al-qaeda we know
[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:25.880]  the shipment we're trying to stop it i'm in a probably call homeless security on air in fact
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:29.720]  guys pull up that see something say something number for me because we're going to try to stop
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:34.600]  this arrogance so that's going on right now robert in michigan i want you to have a comeback
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:39.080]  bringing up that great point that uh black unemployment's basically right at doubled under
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:43.720]  obama and a lot of black commentators i know you know it's just say look i'm not even a conservative
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:48.600]  but this week literally funding attention and he doesn't even go speak in these communities
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:52.040]  and it's almost like well the poor we make you the more you'll be under our control
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:56.040]  that's the view i see if everything i've heard about donald trump this guy really gets off on
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:00.600]  making everybody wealthy and really really likes everybody regardless what color they are uh so
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:04.280]  only you'll be able to come back in a moment but roger can you can you speak from your experience
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:09.400]  40 years well uh look first of all it's anecdotal i must say the number of african americans at
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:15.560]  trump rallies just seems to be disproportionately large and as i travel because i have spoken out
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:21.720]  for trump and on behalf of trump and given a lot of surrogate speeches for trump it's amazing the
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:29.000]  number of people who come up to me in airports on the street in stores in restaurants and they
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:36.360]  high five me the irony is that the vast majority of them are african-american just anecdotally so
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:42.680]  i've seen it firsthand people like the fact that trump would re-energize the economy these people
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:48.280]  want their piece of the american pie they they don't want to be employees they want to be look
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:53.960]  even loose fair cons liking him i mean i'm i'm i it's just getting people want prosperity they
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:58.440]  want to they want to hear we're great well i like his bow ties but i'm not crazy about his politics
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:02.760]  well he just likes hearing you know bring money back to the communities and get the country going
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:10.680]  uh robert michigan i come back to that yeah um well my point is like i know this most most of the
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:16.600]  free work you know a lot of people know this but the mainstream they do well they do a poor job
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:21.800]  my opinion but you know somewhat effective of like everything you mentioned about how bad the clitons
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:25.400]  are you know i watched the clitton chronicles you know i sat there and watched the whole movie
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:32.200]  and it's very factual very you know i presented the fact that i understood it and all the other
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:36.040]  cases that you make mr stone but i guess my question is how do you get that message to the
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:40.760]  mainstream great question thank you robert gotta jump great great question that that's what a campaign
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:45.960]  is about that's why you go out and support super PACs that oppose illy clinton because if the mainstream
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:51.480]  media say cnn doesn't want to interview you that means you have to buy a 30 or seconds 60 second
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:56.920]  spot in between their program breaks that's advertising this is the great thing about
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:02.520]  citizens united used to be just the clinton's and the bush has had political money now any citizen
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:06.680]  can go out there and be effective speech is money let me ask you this because i know you'll
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:10.600]  straight shoot us you don't rah rah you don't cheer lead to put a good face on things in fact i
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:13.640]  think you give us the worst case a lot of times behind the scenes you tell me this is how the
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:17.400]  states we're gonna go when the media is saying the opposite you've been right i mean you're super
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:22.120]  accurate not kissing your butt no practice fact what's his real numbers looking at all the polls
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:26.520]  i mean it's true he's getting ahead of hillary right but i mean what do we face the money issue
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:31.880]  i mean how is trump really doing right now first of all the idea that any republican is running
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:37.480]  essentially even or in a dead heat or slightly behind or slightly ahead of hillary clinton at
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:43.960]  this point is extraordinary you usually don't see this kind of closeness and gap closing until
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:49.240]  much later in the campaign uh that means that there is without any question enough votes
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:56.760]  here to elect Donald trump now trump is about to undergo the most virulent nasty campaign
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:02.760]  of vilification in american political history the same time they're going to try to discredit
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:07.560]  and smear the brave women who are going to stand up and tell people what the real bill clinton is
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:15.080]  like a rapist uh and they're going to attack him on a dozen other things calling him a bigot a racist
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:21.960]  a misogynist a lunatic a wild man it's the very goldwater treatment i don't think it will work
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:28.200]  people are are on to the two-party duopoly and their smear tactics but this is the fact that
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:33.640]  trump is this competitive in states like ohio pennsylvania new york uh is extraordinary this
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:40.520]  is going to be very very is he gonna win california it's not it's not impossible but in all honesty
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:46.120]  in my model for 270 he doesn't need to win all right all right roger stone stone zone dot com

[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:08.600]  information he's exposing here they're trying to talk to congress congress won't give him the time of
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:16.760]  day senators house members uh this is so dangerous what you're about to hear and of course we've had
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:25.240]  brian terry's brother on this is about vengazi this isn't just about fast and furious and this is
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:30.840]  about brian terry being killed so they could cover up the fact that guns weren't just being shipped
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:35.960]  from gun shops that was to blame the overall operation on gun owners but from military basis
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:41.720]  there's about to be another shipment right now as we speak it's about to happen or is happening
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:50.520]  and do we call homeland security on air so this is on record do we call congress what do we do
[02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:57.240]  what do we do when the whistleblowers have come out it's happened and and no one gets in trouble
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:00.920]  we're reaching a level where we have all the witnesses of the stand down order at vengazi
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:06.040]  we knew about that four years ago and it happened but now it's confirmed we know there were troops
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:15.000]  25 minutes away loaded up on an aircraft told to stand down now they can ship the guns directly
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:20.120]  to isis and al-qaeda and we can have people out blowing the whistle that are being physically
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:29.720]  attacked and death-threaded what comes next this is a new level uh in fact guys i was asking did
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:33.560]  you get me the homeland security phone number we bring it into me thank you because i intend
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:38.280]  and i guess today i've done it before call homeland security on air and make a public
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:43.880]  report about this but this is a public report almost 200 stations around the country and millions
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:48.200]  listening and watching on the internet right now and millions more uh when you know the videos of
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:51.720]  this get posted alex this is nico i'm popping in live right now to let you know that we've
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:56.600]  been searching for a number and we've been unable to locate one their other website's been redesigned
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:01.560]  since jacari did that stunt and they're pointing everybody to call 911 now that's right because
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:06.520]  those are the local threat fusion centers they have the whole see something say something
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:12.280]  deal and they still have some 800 numbers to the fbi they still you know what i want to call the fbi
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:18.200]  austin and it actually says san antonio but it redirects to to to austin and then i guess you
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.520]  know what that's a good idea i guess i could call the austin police chief i've got his number
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:27.720]  but that'll be referred to the feds but i mean this is colonel matt smith mack and this is tosh plumley

[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:04.200]  with this person and i think they'll they'll it's it's that one area that the federal government
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:08.520]  executive branch utilized to execute fast and furious and these kind of operations but for
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:14.280]  some reason the legislative branch seems reticent to want to access this domain that is we have a
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:19.560]  unique insight and opportunity to get into so this would blow fast and furious hillary the whole
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:27.400]  system the kingdom come politically and congress won't act on it sadly it appears that way
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:32.040]  wow this is just such a huge deal and i knew that was coming up at the end of the month so i wanted

[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:34.040]  and let this happen okay let me let me back up here and sit back and get a little bit of
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:40.840]  background of how matt and i got together four years ago on your program we mentioned exactly
[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:47.000]  what we're covering now we talked about guns going across the border to mexico which was all up and
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.400]  over and above fast and furious that fast and furious was a cutout for an international gun
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:55.720]  running operation that was being filtered through mexico to the middle east and to
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:16:02.440]  into qaddafi's bunkers that's been documented before the fact we also documented on your program
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:07.720]  and other programs and on my facebook page that monies were going back to the kilry clinton from
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:13.560]  foreign donations of people that was receiving weapons from our arsenals that was approved by
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:20.120]  the direct commercial sales program blue lantern report this was all documented today i don't know
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:26.760]  i helping them post briefly put out an article uh that confirmed the information that went back
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:32.120]  four and a half years ago uh which was covered on your program and also on john b wells program on
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:39.960]  coast to coast on november the second 2013 these were documented uh vetted information that information
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:46.440]  was also at that point in time turned over the u.s senate the congress tre gowdy and grassley
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:52.520]  in the form of 11 been gossip questions and made direct references back to the gun running
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:58.840]  operation which was legal at that point in time but they was going across mexico to the mexican
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:04.520]  army the mexican army was filtering that some of the percentage of those weapons off and sending
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:11.080]  those weapons to the drug cartel which was proven when guzman was arrested and some of those weapons
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:17.560]  ended up in his safe house now what got the current situation between matt and i together
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:26.120]  his investigation terry ryan terry's investigation and my investigation all three dovetail right
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:33.960]  together over a period of five years ryan terry was killed on on uh december and 2010 eight months
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:39.880]  later we were sitting in los cruces new mexico with five sectors of the border patrol intelligence
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:46.600]  unit and we were telling them exactly what we are talking about today the senate the congress
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:52.280]  the president of the united states and the us state department did not they said the information
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:59.960]  was from non-creditable sources multiple sources my and myself included i went on facebook page
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:06.760]  mainly for protect myself and my colleagues from information before the fact by publishing in
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:12.040]  detail exactly what our investigation had run over from a task force that was working out of
[02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:19.960]  port blitz texas into the uh mexican marinos and also uh with the mexican army we had infiltrated
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:24.920]  the mexican army found out that they had informants that was working directly with the cartel and all
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:31.080]  this information was passed on to the us senate and the congress absolutely nothing was done
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:37.080]  it was turned into political a political that we our crew and our investigators and our people and
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:42.280]  our military people had an axe to grind against this administration and they turned it into a
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:49.560]  political vendetta and made us look like total fools as time progressed the information became
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:55.560]  vetted and vetted and vetted now to bring matt matt in and matt can jump in anytime he wants
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:19:02.040]  matt got information about the information was that i had was still ongoing i knew it was ongoing
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:07.000]  from the military task force working out of port blitz texas which was known as task force seven
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:12.440]  military operation boots on the ground inside mexico sure i know i've had family in task force
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:16.280]  six and seven they just said the stuff going on is unbelievable but won't tell me i just thought
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:20.680]  they've resigned out of those because they say it's so corrupt uh what can you tell us colonel
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:27.000]  about what's happening in these task forces and where all this is going now you know so this
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:33.240]  just stopped telling what taj said i i know uh the military uh had been involved uh going back
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:40.920]  to 2005 you know i was i was tasked to uh go to mc as yuma uh for camo kentucky to look for a military
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:46.760]  nexus uh into at that time wide receiver and then fast and furious reported back on some of the things
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:51.880]  that i had found not so much in four camo but certainly in yuma and again that was about o five
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:58.600]  time frame when if you look at the the genesis of fast and furious um the the seeds of it under
[02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:03.720]  wide receiver it began to blossom in yuma and then kind of blossom out there you know from yuma
[02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:10.600]  going kind of going uh to the to the uh eastern part of arizona um and again uh you know not not
[02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:18.120]  but august of 2014 i was um uh talked to by a person identified himself as a colonel taylor
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:24.760]  air force uh osi telling me that the do d was aware of um their installation and equipment
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:30.520]  nexus between them and fast and furious and now we know you know some of these weapons
[02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:37.080]  mr jones are again not just but not just um hand uh hand guns and rifles these are laser
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:41.640]  guided munitions these are stinger missiles these are things that came out of you know the hawthorne
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:46.600]  depot up in hawthorne hawthorne nevada and worked their way down i mean this and let's be clear then
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:52.280]  now they're claiming in mainstream news oh isis built its own stinger missiles and then they
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:57.320]  admit in the article no they actually got some we don't know from where to confuse people so they're
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:21:02.280]  even putting cover stories in undoubtedly isis is already blowing up bringing down airliners uh
[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:07.800]  uh you know one every few months how long until they start using those stinger missiles and what
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:12.920]  is the political class thinking from both of you talk plumbly and turn and search something right
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:18.440]  here the stinger missiles that you make reference to was recorded 400 of them was missing from our
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:23.640]  arsenals and some of them were taken out of the bunkers in libya before qaddafi was killed
[02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:30.840]  we reported the missing of those 400 stinger missiles missing senator john mccown um pain not
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:38.040]  mccown that's the oca director john mccain said that when pigs fly and the sun rises in the west
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:43.400]  right in reference to toss plumbly alleging that there were stinger missiles in isis hands
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:47.480]  two weeks later those stinger missiles was photographed in the back of brand new pickup
[02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:52.840]  trucks it's not confirmed i guess the pig yeah was confirmed i guess the pigs do fly and i guess
[02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:58.840]  the sun does rise in the west now i'm not upset with any of these politicians far as i'm concerned
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:03.320]  they're all down crooks working for special interests and tied in with the international crime
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:09.240]  syndicate i'll say it i'll say what some of these people will not say this is an international
[02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:14.280]  crime syndicate it's an international gun-running operation now i'm going to back up here when those
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:19.800]  weapons went across to mexico and the marines uh marinos investigated confirmed what we had
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:24.520]  and what we had found in warehouses and more as mexico that belonged to the cartel and i
[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:30.040]  photographed them and we went in and there's also a rated ranch that uh they had a very bad day
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:34.840]  according to what the marinos told us at the iron fence which has been photographed i don't
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:39.320]  rattle rattle rattle i'm not trying to rattle i'm just trying to give background when map come
[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:45.000]  along and said hey they're still going on i said absolutely right we know it's still going on how
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:50.840]  do we get congress and how do we get the senate to act all right who approved it it came from the
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:56.600]  u.s. state department they approved the applications for those weapons to lead the country and go to
[02:22:56.600 --> 02:23:03.400]  the mexican army the mexican army built traded a percentage of those weapons off to the drug cartels
[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:10.920]  three of them Joaquin guzman's son-in-all was one of them sure also el chopo you know el chopo
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:15.320]  had 50 cows that were from the military so so this is all going on here's the bottom line
[02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:22.280]  why would the criminal syndicate why would it be crazy enough to give impads to isis and al-qaeda
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:26.360]  they i mean obviously they're doing this on purpose it's still ongoing it's not an accident
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:32.040]  from fast and furious what is the end game what is the master plan it's simple it's very simple
[02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:38.920]  you've got a situation where we start to conflict we escalate the conflict we furnish weapons to
[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:44.280]  both sides of the conflict we keep it going and then we filterates that money back into various
[02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:50.040]  not only a clinton campaign or found a foundation and the clinton global initiative which only by
[02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:55.880]  the way only gives three percent of their funding back into contributions which does a very good
[02:23:55.880 --> 02:24:03.080]  thing very limited as it is there's also 97 that goes to ed to administrative costs or whatever
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:07.480]  and tremendous hours but anyway that's another that's another thing that they still money at every
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:11.480]  level they're master criminals i mean i get it so still the elite haven't done stuff like this before
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:15.400]  unless you're talking about the 80s and they mopped all those up so let me ask the colonel why do you
[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:22.360]  think they're doing us sir i think it's uh you go back to rothschild you know you want to control
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:29.000]  an event you control both sides and i think we much much like when tosh was uh um uh involved
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:35.080]  when in cuban 57 i mean you know the government armed both sides of that of that conflict and uh i
[02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:42.360]  hope and pray i recently emailed house oversight i said i hope and pray that um atf agent john dotton
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:49.560]  another true hero wasn't entirely correct when he said matt the politicians will always only do what's
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:55.160]  in the political self-interest so uh i hope that god this time their self-interest coincides with
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:59.080]  the right thing well that's why we're doing this obviously you're risking your life everybody here
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:06.120]  is let's let's not let's not make bones about it because we understand that you can't just arm these
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:10.200]  radical groups with high tech high impact weapons and it shows our elite is getting more and more
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:15.400]  insane before they try to stop this from happening and they've obviously got some larger plan and we
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:19.560]  want congress everybody to know when the planes get shot down with these you're not going to cover
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:23.880]  it up and it's going to come out and you're not going to get away with it uh this is just so out
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:31.560]  of control uh colonel smith mack yes sir any other points you'd like to add yeah one thing
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:37.640]  if i could i uh the the the person who uh you know tosh knows him as well as as well as kent and
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:44.440]  others uh we ensured information he had got to house oversight end of september 2013 and just as
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:50.440]  a point of again before the fact information that the house oversight was told september late
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:55.640]  september i think september 23rd 2013 that there were grenades and grenade launchers
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:01.160]  involved with these weapons that go on south that wasn't just handguns and and um and uh and
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:08.680]  long rifles and not until october 30th 2014 the doj oig make that public so when congress says
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:14.440]  nothing can have has led to anything it's wrong it's incorrect this was written about in narco
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:22.120]  news in 2010 and 2011 exactly what matt just said bill conroy a good investigative reporter
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:27.800]  reported about this in a series of articles through narco news any listener out there can go run bill
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:34.040]  sure i remember uh celigus till uh the former d age retired he said they tried to hire him out
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:39.960]  by the king ranch to actually train drug cartels uh senola and others as part of a huge civil war
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:46.280]  coming in mexico that was before all the killing started that's right so the point being this was
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:54.920]  been on record for a number of years but our and our agencies have refused including cia and i'll
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:27:01.720]  say it right straight into your camera including the cia and their cia college division or whatever
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:07.640]  you want to call it and their sap special access programs which i'm not supposed to talk about
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:12.360]  and all the fusion centers that we are not supposed to know about they all have this
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:18.680]  information and refuse to act upon it next week according to our sources which have been validated
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:25.720]  in more than one multiple sources or we'll be moving more guns international across the mexican
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:31.800]  border we will be photographing and we're typing our hand we're telling we're talking to someone
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:37.320]  else or here on this camera not just talking to we're talking we're sending a message to someone
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:44.840]  else we're tired of your bs we're coming after you simple as that we will photograph your weapons
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:49.880]  amen we will document their sense of congress and the senate does not want to do this since they
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:54.680]  have to be out for whatever reasons they've got don't want to get involved in this because of the
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:59.400]  white house and their administration does not want us to continue when they get out of control
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:03.640]  they force people to do desperate things went through if they don't want to continue then we
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:09.640]  will continue with far them and we will give the information to them and we will document it i've

[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:30.280]  that's where this is all going with tpp and globalism and world government and the decisions
[02:33:30.280 --> 02:33:34.680]  are made overseas and the government's run by a bunch of hijackers that do whatever they want
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:40.600]  they're now getting a lot of these weapons into europe killing people there western governments have
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:46.280]  brought five million quote refugees in most of them military aged men to europe we don't know the
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:51.800]  numbers here they'll claim oh a few hundred in texas and then it's a few hundred per high school
[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:58.840]  and then per middle school i mean my alma mater had 232 syrian and iraqi refugees last year
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:02.760]  it was in the newspaper the school's collapsing because of it we called all the other schools
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:08.040]  they had them too by the hundreds then they said oh texas has gotten 400 refugees last year
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:15.160]  thousands and thousands in austin they admit the the c-130s land at night nobody's checked or just
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:23.080]  let in they admitted the associated press minnesota's got 22 percent of these uh immigrants have
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:29.720]  tuberculosis now they've got this flesh-eating bacteria that's in the news what is our controlling
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:35.880]  elite thinking why are they so wed to jihad are they planning to let it have a big ted offensive
[02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:40.760]  here then use that ted offensive to take our rights here's the latest article up on info wars.com
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:46.680]  it's red linked facebook twitter banning free speech to form virtual superstate kip dangles
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:51.320]  just wrote an article about the bloomberg ap articles that whitewashed it all put out an
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:55.640]  article basically breaking down the reality as they announced that we're all working with governments
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:35:01.080]  to shut down the anti-government speech talk about ben gazi they they restrict you they ban you
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:07.400]  well the answer is speak out more get involved more take action more now we have just a few
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:11.240]  minutes left here and i appreciate colonel matt smith mack recently retired from the marine
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:17.640]  corb and robert tosh plumley famous whistleblower who for decades been exposing this but last few
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:23.640]  years got out retired uh from what he was doing is contracting for the cia and others and has exposed
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:29.400]  it and this is big stuff you're hearing and and i don't go oh i'm breaking a big story that's good
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:34.680]  for my show i sit here with a rock in the pit of my stomach and go i've got to really cover some
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:40.200]  stuff here that 99% of people are too scared to do because i know where it leads i'm scared of
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:45.240]  where it leads if this continues so the word has got to get out it's getting more and more dangerous
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:52.920]  let me ask colonel smith mack and plumley clearly this is a ten offensive two with jihadis clearly
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:56.920]  they know with these numbers we're gonna have sam bernadinos at some point when they all start
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:02.680]  activating on a weekly basis maybe every day and they've clearly said in europe we're banning your
[02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:07.080]  free speech because if you criticize islam they attack us so the formula is bring them in let them
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:12.280]  attack us when they attack take our rights just like give them stinger missiles let them blow up
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:19.160]  airplanes how does the political elite suspend logic at a level like this to be the cause of all
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:25.880]  of our crises the cause of our problems and then use the problems to kill what's left of the western
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:30.600]  world i mean it's so transparent how are they getting away with this or do you disagree with
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:38.520]  that analysis colonel no sir i agree with your analysis and i think they're just betting betting
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:43.480]  on the uh the hope of and that the american people have apathy and i i just plead with our
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:49.160]  fellow american citizens um don't let this happen i mean imagine you're you're josephine terry the
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:53.720]  mother of brian terry who's been lied to a by our government who congress has uh said they would
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:58.600]  help and and they haven't there's a lot of bloating and haven't haven't been in the government uh i
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:03.720]  understand you know the the kind of the no no offense intended on part polish but the polish
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:07.640]  salute where you know nobody knows what's going on and nobody takes that responsibility that's
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:15.640]  part of the i think the uh modus operandi here and uh until we as citizens say enough like tosh
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:21.000]  and i have said and others you know enough where we are going to expose this come hell or high water
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.560]  because this is we this is our country dang it this is not going to happen this is the line on the
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:30.120]  sand got folks in government and out this is the line on the sand yes sir i say if we don't stop here
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:35.960]  if we don't stop this and and and put our spine up and be and my guy we're americans not americans
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:42.120]  uh we we we got a i'm only put my life my blood my money my everything on the line i know tosh is
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:47.400]  two years well sir and you got the terry family for god's sakes like the like the families of the
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:52.360]  bangazi thing they just want some damn answer well it just shows how ruthless they are 13
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:57.560]  hours stand down eight hours of combat let everybody die then lie about it i mean it's just
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:02.520]  and hillary lying about being in combat being shot at like brian williams and then there's
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:07.720]  a shock 75 pullout they'll still say that they want her to keep running even if she's indicted
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:12.760]  i mean tosh i get you it's lying on the sand and if we know about this tosh i wonder what else is
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:19.320]  going on the good news is i know you talk to him too a lot of current military people officers
[02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:24.040]  special forces you name it they've never been more awake and more upset so the establishment
[02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:29.560]  better understand they're not invincible tosh all right let me go back to the question you ask
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:36.520]  very simple just ask why they let it go on it's very simple would you take 265 million dollars
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:41.720]  if you had your own private foundation set up if it required you to let this stuff go on
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:47.080]  simple question yes no i wouldn't no i wouldn't well some people in the congress and the senate
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:51.800]  and the and the potas and the white house would and they have and they demonstrated so they sold
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:56.520]  us out we've been sold out ready that they have now let me back up here and i don't want to halt
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:39:01.800]  the whole airways the one of the things that we have not covered here is that the investigation

[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:19.240]  on the very same thing that we're talking about here he was told to stand not stand down he was
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:27.320]  told to halt that was the word use halt h a u l t halt all it is investigation uh for the safety
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:34.280]  sake uh political reasons anyway he ended up getting killed in pep canyon questionable death on that

[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:26.200]  realize it's there but we are sick people remember drudge came out and said we're a very sick society

[03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:16.520]  way if i wanted to just do really good radio the stuff on drudge report dot com he's just the most
[03:00:16.520 --> 03:00:21.240]  wild selection of stuff every day i should just do the show off that most talk shows do i do a lot
[03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:27.000]  of it off that i've got stacks and it is also important from info wars dot com but he didn't
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:33.400]  beat his chest animal expert says gorilla new boy who fell into his enclosure was defenseless
[03:00:33.400 --> 03:00:39.400]  and would never have attacked him yeah not not one of those uh african great gorillas i mean
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:48.040]  those things are pretty sweet to things that they don't see as a threat and the argument is if they
[03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:52.760]  shot him with a tranquilizer he could have flipped out and hurt the kid on accident but that's just
[03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:57.080]  from what i know reading about gorillas and watching shows about them uh that's just not the
[03:00:57.080 --> 03:01:02.840]  case now baboons or something maybe even some chimpanzees would flip out and hurt the kid but
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:07.560]  not not not a gorilla that's the thing about holly people think a gorillas is a stupid movie you know
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:11.400]  the gorillas kill everybody and stuff that's just a bunch that's just a load of bull folks
[03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:17.240]  gorillas don't do that unless you attack them they're pretty smart they know humans have guns
[03:01:17.240 --> 03:01:23.000]  they run but um the Cincinnati zoo i didn't mean to come back and cover that i was just reading about
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:27.800]  it an animal behavior expert believes uh that the gorilla who was shot dead when a four-year-old
[03:01:27.800 --> 03:01:32.840]  boy fell into the zoo enclosure was investigating not attacking the child which is understood was
[03:01:32.840 --> 03:01:37.800]  defenseless well yeah they like little kids kittens you name it they all have like even the males
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:48.120]  of like a maternal instinct the 180 kilogram uh critically endangered western lowland gorilla
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:53.880]  was killed by officials Cincinnati zoo in the u.s just one day after his 17th birthday after the
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:02:00.200]  boy climbed through the barriers and fell 4.5 meters into the enclosure you know everywhere i go
[03:02:01.480 --> 03:02:06.120]  i'll see like if there's a crack on the street that big now on private property you'll see
[03:02:06.120 --> 03:02:12.520]  danger crack somebody can sue you and everywhere's gotten rid of diving boards but now all the new
[03:02:12.520 --> 03:02:18.520]  pools like the w i won't state a w it's all trendy all crap i've stated them in europe you name it
[03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:24.360]  and it's like a one-foot pool now it's like the trendier and trendier is like having no
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:28.120]  services and now you watch they're gonna start even not letting humans get near animals because
[03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:32.360]  people don't watch their kids and they climb in that's the nanny state of people that own restaurants
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:37.400]  where they have a regular deck with a five-foot drop they're having like put sheet metal up because
[03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:42.440]  kids will fall through and then the parents sue them there's no common sense it's all just a bunch
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:50.520]  of idiots everywhere this video of shooting the gorilla and just being a nice little kid
[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:54.680]  footage taken from a visitor shows the gorilla grabbing the boy by the shirt
[03:02:55.960 --> 03:02:59.640]  many are placing the blame squarely on the parents of the four-year-old boy who investigators
[03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:07.000]  believe crawled through the railing barrier there's really sad video of the whole of the whole
[03:03:07.720 --> 03:03:11.960]  thing but i'm going to do a special report on this in the whole nanny state because you know
[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:15.720]  that's what's that's what's causing all this and i can get while they shot the gorilla because
[03:03:15.720 --> 03:03:19.960]  you know he's obviously agitated he's got the kid he doesn't know what to do it's very exciting
[03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:24.280]  when you're locked up in a jail and then you know there's having a little animal in there with you
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:28.520]  and you don't know what to do with it the gorilla's not stupid he's looking for its parent
[03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:35.080]  he's expecting that somebody's gonna come crawling in wanting this baby and so he's just checking
[03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:41.160]  the kid out not knowing what to do and well he gets he gets shot so that footage is up on info
[03:03:41.160 --> 03:03:47.160]  wars.com as well but i'm gonna shoot a quick special report for the nightly news on that because
[03:03:47.160 --> 03:03:53.160]  you know i get why they shot him because if they would have not done it and there's a small chance
[03:03:53.160 --> 03:03:57.880]  the gorilla could actually hurt the kid it'd be all over because the way the gorilla's running away
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:01.320]  from yelling crowds if you watch the video in the audio they hear so here's the yelling and here's the
[03:04:01.320 --> 03:04:05.560]  so it's trying to get the kid and run to wherever it's safe and one time i had some neighbors i had
[03:04:05.560 --> 03:04:10.120]  this chihuahua named Conan as a joke it was a tiny black chihuahua dark brown chihuahua
[03:04:11.080 --> 03:04:16.120]  this neighbor woman the dog didn't like other people you know it was a one person dog or whatever
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:20.280]  or two person dog and she the lady kept following the dog trying to quote give it back to us the
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:24.840]  neighbor and ran it out in the street under William Cannon when i lived down there and they just smashed
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:29.800]  the dog flattered in pancake and another neighbor saw it called me i came home from work and they had
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:34.280]  the dog in a trash bag but it's kind of that example the nanny state oh the dog he's out let me chase
[03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:39.480]  it down the road till i run it out into the highway to get run over flattered in a pancake

[03:07:04.280 --> 03:07:10.600]  basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe
[03:07:10.600 --> 03:07:18.040]  a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching
[03:07:18.040 --> 03:07:24.680]  filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are
[03:07:24.680 --> 03:07:30.840]  silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics
[03:07:30.840 --> 03:07:37.480]  that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death i personally

[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:29.720]  we are back it's the alex jones show live fourth hour overdrive with me your host paul joseph
[03:08:29.720 --> 03:08:36.440]  whatson and we're gonna get the european perspective of course we've got the big brexit vote coming
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:44.280]  up here in the united kingdom in a few weeks time the official campaign for the vote leave
[03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:51.400]  movement is not including immigration as one of its major platform issues in campaigning for
[03:08:51.400 --> 03:08:57.560]  britain to leave the european union which is a massive mistake because the polls all show that
[03:08:57.560 --> 03:09:05.800]  this is the primary concern amongst the british voters and for very good reason because we've
[03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:13.480]  seen again and again this cultural enrichment that has infused our wonderful country via the
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:21.240]  gravy train of muslim migrants over the past year is not proving to beneficial this is a top
[03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:27.800]  story up on info wars dot com right now swedish government kicks local family out of home gives
[03:09:27.800 --> 03:09:35.560]  it to muslim migrants that's right sweden in which politicians encourage their citizens to give up
[03:09:35.560 --> 03:09:42.360]  their garages to house asylum seekers now they're just taking people who are born in sweden these
[03:09:42.360 --> 03:09:48.760]  are locals who were born in the town grown up there lived there their entire lives and saying get the
[03:09:48.760 --> 03:09:56.440]  hell out you're being replaced by the precious muslim migrant you must bow down and worship them
[03:09:56.440 --> 03:10:02.280]  otherwise you're racist a local family in the swedish city of lingo has been ordered by the
[03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:07.160]  government to leave their home so that it may be given to migrants arriving from a foreign country
[03:10:08.040 --> 03:10:14.280]  father of two teenage boys of a rustin received a voicemail from his local municipality telling him
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:20.680]  he would need to vacate the property by august in order to make way for asylum seekers from the
[03:10:20.680 --> 03:10:27.560]  middle east he's being culturally enriched this is a quote listen to this this is a guy who's got
[03:10:27.560 --> 03:10:35.240]  two teenage sons born in the city grew up there lived there their entire lives they're paying
[03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:41.960]  the government rent this is not a free welfare house they're taxpayers the father works he's
[03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:48.200]  paying the government rent he's got a contract the government left him a voicemail and said that
[03:10:48.200 --> 03:10:54.040]  that contract would not be renewed he would be kicked out and replaced by muslim migrants who
[03:10:54.600 --> 03:11:02.440]  presumably almost 100 100 percent guaranteed aren't going to be paying a penny even though
[03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:08.200]  sweden is suffering from a drastic housing shortage right now they're kicking their own
[03:11:08.200 --> 03:11:14.680]  citizens out of their home to make way for these economic migrants this is a quote from the father
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:21.320]  i was evicted from my home over the phone when i asked for the reason he said that people come
[03:11:21.320 --> 03:11:26.920]  from other countries he left the news and basically just said have a nice weekend
[03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:34.280]  he goes on it feels like i'm worthless even though i pay taxes and my kids go to school here
[03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:40.200]  you cannot put a family on the streets for another family well you can if they're from
[03:11:40.200 --> 03:11:46.040]  the middle east if they're precious asylum seekers who have been such a great benefit
[03:11:46.600 --> 03:11:51.960]  to the culture of sweden that since that country opened its doors to mass immigration
[03:11:51.960 --> 03:12:00.360]  the rape level skyrocketed 1400 percent because it's such a great form of cultural enrichment
[03:12:00.360 --> 03:12:07.720]  this is a government that has islamists beheading people in ikea stores and what does it do the
[03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:14.440]  very next day doesn't take measures to combat islamists to combat the radicalization of muslims in
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:21.560]  the swedish no go ghettos where police firefighters ambulance personnel are pelted with stones
[03:12:21.560 --> 03:12:29.160]  chased out of the area it doesn't do any of that what does it do instead it lectures swedes about
[03:12:29.160 --> 03:12:37.960]  islamophobia it organizes anti islamophobia marches in the very days after islamists have
[03:12:37.960 --> 03:12:46.120]  beheaded swedes in ikea because it's their fault and it's this family's fault presumably for trying
[03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:53.000]  to actually pay the government pay taxes agree a contract to stay in this home not good enough
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:13:01.480]  you will be supplanted you will be replaced and again sweden is not the only european government
[03:13:01.480 --> 03:13:06.520]  that is turfing out its own citizens of social housing which in many cases they actually pay
[03:13:06.520 --> 03:13:13.560]  the government it's not free to accommodate the influx of muslim migrants we've featured the reports
[03:13:13.560 --> 03:13:21.320]  out of germany where these migrants are being given four star hotels while low income germans
[03:13:21.320 --> 03:13:26.680]  are being ordered to leave their homes the telegraph reported that germans are now beginning to
[03:13:26.680 --> 03:13:36.280]  receive notices of eviction to make way for asylum seekers again placing the welfare the
[03:13:36.280 --> 03:13:42.760]  legitimacy the importance of these economic migrants the majority of whom don't come from
[03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:49.960]  syria they're not refugees they head straight for the northern european welfare havens they're not
[03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:56.280]  even migrants they're not refugees but they're being treated like gods because that's the new
[03:13:56.280 --> 03:14:02.360]  humanitarian trendy thing to do and of course once they've imported them once they've had
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:08.600]  their numerous children which they're prone to do like erdogan out of turkey says you know
[03:14:09.240 --> 03:14:17.320]  decrying contraception urging muslims to have more and more children while europe dies basically
[03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:23.000]  fertility dropping through the floor all those people that those governments are bringing
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:28.440]  bringing into these northern european welfare states eventually they're gonna get the right to vote
[03:14:30.040 --> 03:14:36.360]  they're dependent on government they're gonna vote for more big government that's why you've got
[03:14:36.360 --> 03:14:43.800]  green party politicians in germany heralding their arrival heralding the fact that germans
[03:14:43.800 --> 03:14:50.120]  will be a minority in their own cities by the year 2030 saying it's a good thing
[03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:57.880]  decrying the so-called right wingers who dare stand up for their own populations
[03:14:59.080 --> 03:15:04.280]  but those muslim migrants are just gonna vote for more big government and that's the main incentive
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:11.800]  for big government to import them in the first place also big business gets access to cheap
[03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:18.360]  labor so again crony corporatism wins out at the end of the day and again if you look at germany for
[03:15:18.360 --> 03:15:29.000]  example in berlin alone they're spending 600 million euros a year to house migrants in some
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:39.400]  cases in upmarket berlin hotels we're talking 18 000 euros per refugee per year now that is
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:44.680]  enough to basically fix berlin's homeless population berlin's homeless problem they have a homeless
[03:15:44.680 --> 03:15:51.240]  population of 10 000 people and yet the government is going to be paying in berlin alone for 10 000
[03:15:51.240 --> 03:15:59.000]  people to stay in four star hotels so they could fix their homeless population overnight but no
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:06.680]  you're a german citizen living in germany you're scum you're a swede you're a you're a single
[03:16:06.680 --> 03:16:13.160]  father with two children two teenage children trying to raise them working hard paying taxes
[03:16:13.160 --> 03:16:19.960]  paying the government to rent a house having a contract you're scum you will be replaced by the
[03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:26.520]  precious muslim migrants who are proving to be such a great benefit to our society as is seen
[03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:33.640]  again in germany you remember at the time we reported on it cologne of course the mainstream
[03:16:33.640 --> 03:16:38.280]  media didn't report on it for three days because along with the police they tried to cover it up
[03:16:39.080 --> 03:16:45.000]  but it emerged on social media the mass molestation of women in cologne in numerous other european
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:51.800]  and german cities on the evening of new year's eve and we've played the footage we featured the
[03:16:51.800 --> 03:16:57.880]  eyewitness reports from the bouncers who the women fled to for protection on that evening
[03:16:57.880 --> 03:17:03.720]  they described it as a civil war the police described it as a civil war style situation
[03:17:04.600 --> 03:17:12.440]  firecrackers fireworks going off everywhere being thrown at crowds women being groped molested
[03:17:13.240 --> 03:17:20.520]  their clothes torn off well surprise surprise it's happened once again this is out of the daily mail
[03:17:20.520 --> 03:17:27.960]  26 women and it could be up to 30 plus according to this report a sexually assaulted at german
[03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:33.480]  concert with victims surrounded by mobs of migrant men and gropes in copycat attacks
[03:17:34.040 --> 03:17:39.080]  like those in cologne a group of asylum seekers sexually assaulted numerous women at a free
[03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:43.400]  concert in germany at the weekend in attacks similar to those carried out in cologne on new
[03:17:43.400 --> 03:17:49.800]  year's eve three pakistani men and again you saw in cologne that the vast majority of them
[03:17:49.800 --> 03:17:56.040]  who were moroccan were not arrested three pakistani men are already under arrest for 26
[03:17:56.040 --> 03:17:59.800]  women file complaints that they had been improperly touched fondled and groped
[03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:05.400]  during the festival in the city of darmstadt police have said the number of complainants
[03:18:05.400 --> 03:18:10.200]  could rise between two and three more men are still being sought by police as victims receive
[03:18:10.200 --> 03:18:15.080]  counseling on authorities try to cool down rising tensions against migrants in general because of
[03:18:15.080 --> 03:18:19.400]  course that again is the main problem it's the islamophobia that's causing all these women
[03:18:19.400 --> 03:18:27.240]  to be groped obviously like the mayor of cologne who came out a few days afterwards and said basically
[03:18:28.200 --> 03:18:33.000]  defend yourself against the rapists by keeping them at arm's length
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:40.920]  virtually blaming the women for what happened to them and ludicrously suggesting that that
[03:18:40.920 --> 03:18:46.680]  could be a solution to the problem which is sweeping europe which the primary victims of this
[03:18:46.680 --> 03:18:55.320]  are children muslim migrant children in migrant camps do we care about them we obviously don't
[03:18:55.320 --> 03:19:02.040]  care about the german people the swedish women they had a report out of norway last week which
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:11.080]  blamed the large-scale spike in sexual assaults on nordic drinking culture because nordic drinking
[03:19:11.080 --> 03:19:17.160]  culture is a completely new phenomenon we've never had that before have we no they refuse to
[03:19:17.160 --> 03:19:23.000]  even identify the fact that most of the problem is arising out of bringing in people who treat
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:29.240]  women as second-class citizens who think that they're liable to be groped to be sexually assaulted
[03:19:29.240 --> 03:19:34.120]  because they're not wearing a frigging hijab because they're not covered up
[03:19:34.120 --> 03:19:44.200]  so now again another case of this in germany how many more cases of this before feminist and so
[03:19:44.200 --> 03:19:51.480]  called women's rights activists actually stand up and identify the real aggressive patriarchal
[03:19:51.480 --> 03:19:58.040]  culture that is causing this we'll be back with more news on the fourth hour overdrive of the

[03:24:38.840 --> 03:24:45.640]  never retracted even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary that donald trump was
[03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:52.760]  to blame for the violence being staged at his rallies almost exclusively being staged by
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:25:00.920]  bernie sanders supporters that narrative is now finally being overturned in light of these videos

[03:27:55.480 --> 03:28:03.320]  policies the cost 1.1 million dollars and again this gets to the point which i'm going to make
[03:28:03.320 --> 03:28:09.800]  and i'm going to get more into depth after the break which is this we're winning okay we had this
[03:28:09.800 --> 03:28:17.160]  huge social justice warrior tantrum last year the freaking out over the halloween costumes
[03:28:17.160 --> 03:28:24.280]  the cultural appropriation again the university of missouri all these ridiculous lists of demands
[03:28:25.320 --> 03:28:31.240]  from permanently triggered safe spaces who are basically trying to completely overturn every
[03:28:31.240 --> 03:28:37.000]  existing system every social moray every political construct whether it's good or bad
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:43.000]  because they're flagrant communists you can read the communist manifesto in fact curtain
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:48.920]  immo quoted from it in an article today one of the very final passages where it says that's their
[03:28:48.920 --> 03:28:55.640]  plan is to overturn absolutely everything and remould society in their own image and given
[03:28:55.640 --> 03:29:02.200]  that their image is punching and spitting people spitting at people in the face who disagree with
[03:29:02.200 --> 03:29:08.120]  them because they have no argument that's probably not an image which we want society to reflect
[03:29:09.320 --> 03:29:15.960]  so you saw at the university of missouri the consequences of that tantrum their new freshman
[03:29:15.960 --> 03:29:23.880]  class is down 1400 students smaller than last year they've got 24 drop in donations to the
[03:29:23.880 --> 03:29:28.600]  football team that went on strike they've got a six million dollar decline in donations for the
[03:29:28.600 --> 03:29:36.280]  month of december they're losing no one wants to go there because smart successful people don't
[03:29:36.280 --> 03:29:42.520]  want to be educated at an insane asylum which is what a lot of these universities are now
[03:29:42.520 --> 03:29:47.400]  being turned into with the inmates running the asylum we'll be back with this and more news

[03:33:20.920 --> 03:33:27.320]  yeah that's so loose sorry you're back on the fourth hour overdrive of the alex jones show
[03:33:27.320 --> 03:33:34.120]  with me your host paul joseph watson so the university of missouri's response to the fact
[03:33:34.120 --> 03:33:41.640]  that it's been hemorrhaging money from every orifice since last year's social justice warrior
[03:33:41.640 --> 03:33:51.640]  meltdown tantrum is to waste another one million dollars on a diversity audit again completely
[03:33:51.640 --> 03:34:02.280]  pointless exercise simply to satiate triggered demented left-wing idiots look at these numbers
[03:34:02.280 --> 03:34:12.440]  their new freshman class is 1470 students smaller than last year they've experienced a 24 drop in
[03:34:12.440 --> 03:34:19.800]  donations in the three months that followed the football player strike they experienced a six
[03:34:19.800 --> 03:34:26.440]  million dollar decline in donations for the month of december so how have they responded well they've
[03:34:26.440 --> 03:34:34.920]  doubled down on their idiocy i mean look at compare the reactions of these universities i talked about
[03:34:34.920 --> 03:34:43.000]  the inmates running the asylum de paul university we saw the footage last week again mylo enopolis
[03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:50.760]  tries to give a speech at an event it's crashed by unhinged black lives matter demonstrators
[03:34:50.760 --> 03:34:57.720]  who almost provoke violence the university demanded that breitbart paid the security cost
[03:34:57.720 --> 03:35:05.000]  they paid the bill and the security did absolutely nothing because they were ordered to do nothing
[03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:11.240]  by the university the police were told by the university not to get involved even though if
[03:35:11.240 --> 03:35:17.080]  it was the other way around if so-called evil right-wingers had crashed the safe space of
[03:35:17.080 --> 03:35:24.520]  these of these whiny crybabies it would have been complete bedlam there would have been arrests
[03:35:24.520 --> 03:35:30.520]  there would have been horrified newspaper headlines the next day but de paul university
[03:35:30.520 --> 03:35:37.640]  did nothing the president offered a mealy-mouthed apology which meant absolutely nothing and what's
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:46.280]  the result well a 1.1 rating out of five on their official facebook page again the market
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:54.440]  place of free ideas has completely trashed their reputation and rightly so who would want to go
[03:35:54.440 --> 03:36:02.520]  to an institution a university the whole frigging point of a university is to share ideas is to have
[03:36:02.520 --> 03:36:10.280]  your own beliefs challenged they stand diametrically opposed to that and now they're going to suffer in
[03:36:10.280 --> 03:36:17.320]  the free marketplace of ideas and rightly so the university of Missouri is suffering in terms of
[03:36:17.320 --> 03:36:23.720]  funding the hemorrhaging money from left right and center because again they've allowed the inmates
[03:36:23.720 --> 03:36:32.280]  to run the asylum and smart successful people don't want to be educated at an insane asylum but then
[03:36:32.280 --> 03:36:39.480]  you can look at other examples better examples Rutgers University again you had a Milo event
[03:36:39.480 --> 03:36:45.160]  which was crashed by social justice warriors the president came out afterwards defended quote
[03:36:45.160 --> 03:36:51.240]  controversial ideas as fundamental to the intellectual life of the university basically
[03:36:51.240 --> 03:37:02.200]  stated the fact obelin college rejected the egregious absurd list of demands from their triggered
[03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:11.000]  safe space students calling it deeply troubling you saw Melissa click again back during that Missouri
[03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:19.080]  mass tantrum last year calling for muscle to silence the first amendment she was fired by the
[03:37:19.080 --> 03:37:24.760]  university and rightly so and again i'm getting messages every single day from college students
[03:37:24.760 --> 03:37:30.600]  who are on our side so when we lambast these triggered safe spaces at these universities
[03:37:30.600 --> 03:37:37.320]  across america and the united kingdom let's just realize that a lot of those students are no longer
[03:37:37.320 --> 03:37:43.320]  going along with it so we're winning we're really starting to convince some of these
[03:37:43.320 --> 03:37:50.600]  universities to actually stand up for the very foundation the very purpose of what a university
[03:37:50.600 --> 03:37:58.600]  is supposed to be but over in the uk we have this headline out of the daily mail students call for
[03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:04.600]  students call for prisons to be banned n us group headed by union's anti-semitic new president says
[03:38:04.600 --> 03:38:12.600]  all criminals should be freed this is the new social justice warrior cause freeing all violent
[03:38:12.600 --> 03:38:19.160]  criminals this is no surprise given that the head of the n us a woman called Malia buata
[03:38:19.160 --> 03:38:29.560]  came out recently and basically said that she refused to denounce isis she refused to condemn
[03:38:29.560 --> 03:38:36.600]  isis saying that doing so would be an act of islamophobia how many times have i talked about
[03:38:36.600 --> 03:38:44.120]  the alliance between islamis and leftists that alliance is moving closer because a lot of these
[03:38:44.120 --> 03:38:52.680]  leftists are anti-semites they hate jews they're racist so now an influential students group has
[03:38:52.680 --> 03:38:57.720]  called for prisons to be abolished because they are sexist and racist in the latest in a series
[03:38:57.720 --> 03:39:03.800]  of far-left interventions by the student movement the national union of students black students
[03:39:03.800 --> 03:39:09.000]  conference also voted to step up its fight against the government's anti extremism agenda in other
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:14.520]  words refusing to condemn isis the controversial votes at the conference in bradford came after
[03:39:15.240 --> 03:39:19.480]  malia buattia was elected president of the union defeating the more moderate incumbent she has
[03:39:19.480 --> 03:39:25.560]  previously argued that it is islamophobic to oppose isis and described one university as a
[03:39:25.560 --> 03:39:33.880]  zionist outpost because it has a large jewish society so now they're actually calling for prisons
[03:39:33.880 --> 03:39:40.920]  to be abolished no one's debating that the prison industrial complex isn't a problem that locking
[03:39:40.920 --> 03:39:47.240]  up people you know for possessing an ounce of marijuana isn't completely ridiculous that's
[03:39:47.240 --> 03:39:53.880]  not the argument they're actually arguing to release all the prisoners because disproportionately
[03:39:54.440 --> 03:39:59.480]  many of them are black of course that's nothing to do with the fact that black people commit
[03:39:59.480 --> 03:40:04.280]  disproportionately more crimes but again we can't talk about that because facts are racist
[03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:11.960]  so we're having victories on at some level at universities in the us but in the uk
[03:40:13.480 --> 03:40:22.120]  again a long way to go now over in france paris tourism hit by a tax protest this is afp
[03:40:22.920 --> 03:40:28.440]  already suffering from the impact of last year's jihadist attacks tourism in paris faces a fresh
[03:40:28.440 --> 03:40:33.240]  challenge from the recent wave of violent strikes and protests tourism bosses warned on monday
[03:40:34.360 --> 03:40:40.680]  listen to these figures paris's tourism industry is basically collapsing at this point
[03:40:41.320 --> 03:40:48.200]  japanese visitors down 50 percent 56 percent in the first quarter of the year russians visitors
[03:40:48.200 --> 03:40:59.000]  down 35 percent again similar numbers with chinese tourists people don't want to visit paris and it's
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:05.240]  not just because you know hugger muslim didn't work they got attacked charlie hebdo they got
[03:41:05.240 --> 03:41:11.960]  attacked again last november it's not just down to that it's because the leftists now in paris
[03:41:11.960 --> 03:41:19.000]  and other major cities in france are actually protesting against these new labor reforms
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:24.760]  which the government is desperately trying to pass because they've got a 10 percent unemployment rate
[03:41:25.960 --> 03:41:32.360]  basically these labor reforms say that governments have the right to hire and fire people
[03:41:33.880 --> 03:41:40.440]  if they're performing poorly as a company i mean god forbid they would want to do that right
[03:41:40.440 --> 03:41:47.800]  they also say they have the right to ask employees in france to work more than 35 hours a week
[03:41:49.560 --> 03:41:56.840]  again god forbid that you would be asked to work more than 35 hours a week and of course
[03:41:56.840 --> 03:42:02.520]  this goes back to the stereotype which i'm afraid is true in many cases and you know i love friends
[03:42:02.520 --> 03:42:07.720]  i visit friends regularly my parents live there the culture's good the food's great
[03:42:07.720 --> 03:42:14.040]  they but french people are really lazy i'm sorry but the stereotype is true
[03:42:14.760 --> 03:42:21.720]  they've got this huge leftist union movement which is a hangover from basically communists
[03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:28.440]  from the 60s and every single time they try to stimulate the economy by giving businesses
[03:42:28.440 --> 03:42:35.720]  more freedom to excel to hire people who actually do the job do a good job and to not be beholden
[03:42:35.720 --> 03:42:41.160]  to employees like it's some kind of welfare they riot in the streets
[03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:47.160]  you know their their three hour lunch breaks aren't long enough apparently and now they're
[03:42:47.160 --> 03:42:53.400]  all so protesting against this law in france which they've just passed they made it a law
[03:42:54.200 --> 03:43:01.480]  that a company with over 50 employees in france if it sends out a work email to an employee outside
[03:43:01.480 --> 03:43:09.400]  of work hours then that's a crime they actually passed that as a law in france so if you if you
[03:43:09.400 --> 03:43:16.840]  leave work as one of these you know bedwetting labor union members who has a tantrum if he's
[03:43:16.840 --> 03:43:23.480]  asked to work over 35 hours a week if you leave work at five o'clock and you get a work email at
[03:43:23.480 --> 03:43:31.880]  5 30 whether you read it or not whether you respond to it or not that is a crime by the company
[03:43:31.880 --> 03:43:39.960]  that sent out that email is it really any wonder that france's economy is in the toilet right now
[03:43:39.960 --> 03:43:46.600]  that they've got a 10 unemployment rate the combination of kowtowing to islamists to these
[03:43:46.600 --> 03:43:53.560]  ghettos inviting more attacks and then again kowtowing to these leftists who are now rioting
[03:43:53.560 --> 03:44:02.040]  in the streets just like the islamists are attacking police and basically causing absolute
[03:44:02.040 --> 03:44:08.600]  bedlam and it goes back to that stereotype which i'm afraid is in most cases very true
[03:44:08.600 --> 03:44:13.640]  french people are very lazy it's a hangover from this communist labor union movement
[03:44:13.640 --> 03:44:19.800]  and it's causing all kinds of problems for their quote economic recovery which has never happened
[03:44:20.440 --> 03:44:26.920]  because they're so deeply entrenched in the EU's anemic economic growth that they can't get out
[03:44:26.920 --> 03:44:33.640]  of it and the government's desperately trying to pass these laws to reinvigorate the business market
[03:44:34.360 --> 03:44:39.640]  and they're basically rioting in the streets because of it because it's this communist labor
[03:44:39.640 --> 03:44:46.520]  movement hangover and they're stereotypically very lazy people sorry which brings me on to this
[03:44:46.520 --> 03:44:52.680]  article out the college fix social science professor defends stereotypes says many are accurate
[03:44:53.720 --> 03:45:01.080]  my god could it be that logic and facts are actually true once again a ruckus university
[03:45:01.080 --> 03:45:06.280]  social science professor set out to research how stereotypes are inaccurate so he went he set out to
[03:45:06.280 --> 03:45:11.320]  prove that they're inaccurate and they're just down to racial and gender prejudices
[03:45:12.120 --> 03:45:17.800]  so he could proclaim and promote that that to the world with hard scientific data but eventually
[03:45:18.440 --> 03:45:25.880]  made a startling discovery most stereotypes are accurate well what do you know scholarly
[03:45:25.880 --> 03:45:31.880]  claims of stereotype inaccuracy are baseless dr lee justin told the college fix in an interview
[03:45:31.880 --> 03:45:36.680]  he says quote when i first began my research i had assumed all their social scientists declaring
[03:45:36.680 --> 03:45:40.760]  stereotypes to be inaccurate were right so i wanted to know the basis for those claims
[03:45:42.200 --> 03:45:46.040]  so he basically dug down into the basis for all these studies all these claims that
[03:45:47.480 --> 03:45:54.680]  stereotypes about race about gender about whatever are based on inaccurate prejudices
[03:45:54.680 --> 03:46:01.640]  turns out that's not true many researchers site social psychologists gordon alport's classic book
[03:46:01.640 --> 03:46:06.440]  the nature of prejudice in support of the claim that stereotypes are inaccurate or at least
[03:46:06.440 --> 03:46:12.040]  exaggerations of real differences but all part relied on a few anecdotes hardly scientific
[03:46:12.040 --> 03:46:18.600]  evidence justin said so this researcher basically found that these stereotypes about race and gender
[03:46:18.600 --> 03:46:25.720]  and politics as well would generally not always but generally found to be true
[03:46:26.760 --> 03:46:34.520]  so once again expect this guy to be viciously attacked by social justice warriors for daring
[03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:42.680]  to point out the fact that whether due to biological differences race differences iq
[03:46:42.680 --> 03:46:49.480]  differences gender behavior differences that all humans are not the same and they tend
[03:46:51.400 --> 03:46:58.440]  to engage in stereotypical behavior god forbid he's had an objective reality based perspective
[03:46:58.440 --> 03:47:05.000]  on that and he's revealed himself as a hate criminal to the college fix so expect him to
[03:47:05.000 --> 03:47:11.320]  be viciously attacked by social justice warriors over the coming days now alex talked about this
[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:16.760]  in the show of course the eu is linked up with twitter and tech firms to combat hate speech
[03:47:17.400 --> 03:47:24.760]  again this is the eu commission which is an unelected body which acts as both the legislative
[03:47:24.760 --> 03:47:32.200]  and the executive of europe there's no separation of powers and these people aren't elected in the
[03:47:32.200 --> 03:47:37.400]  first place this is a dictatorship so it's no surprise that they're now teaming up with facebook
[03:47:37.400 --> 03:47:45.080]  and twitter to censor quote hate speech hate speech about the amazing muslim migrants who
[03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:49.560]  are bringing so much cultural enrichment to the continent of europe now of course we know
[03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:55.880]  how they characterize some of that hate speech because we had this headline out of brightbot
[03:47:55.880 --> 03:48:01.240]  from back in january you tweet a lot watch your tone cops threaten dutchman for opposing
[03:48:01.240 --> 03:48:07.720]  government mass migration plans so a guy in the netherlands who tweeted that he thought his
[03:48:07.720 --> 03:48:15.160]  government's refugee policy was a bad plan got a home visit from the police that's the new definition
[03:48:15.160 --> 03:48:23.960]  of hate speech and listen to this quote from vira jewell over the eu commissioner responsible for
[03:48:23.960 --> 03:48:31.480]  justice consumers and gender equality again unelected nobody even knows who she is represents
[03:48:31.480 --> 03:48:39.960]  a dictatorial body a Byzantine empire quote the internet is a place for free speech not hate speech
[03:48:41.800 --> 03:48:47.160]  okay under the first amendment as the supreme court has defined it over and over again hate
[03:48:47.160 --> 03:48:57.480]  speech is free speech you have to defend unpopular speech for free speech to exist at all but of
[03:48:57.480 --> 03:49:03.480]  course the first amendment definition of free speech which the supreme court has upheld has
[03:49:03.480 --> 03:49:09.720]  not been applied globally because it actually defends free speech what they're actually applying
[03:49:09.720 --> 03:49:17.800]  in terms of this eu commission twitter plan to censor quote hate speech is the un declaration
[03:49:17.800 --> 03:49:25.800]  of human rights which of course doesn't give us any human rights because under article 20 brackets
[03:49:25.800 --> 03:49:32.360]  two of the un declaration of human rights when it applies to free speech it says quote that it
[03:49:32.360 --> 03:49:37.800]  does not require states to prohibit all negative statements towards towards national groups races
[03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:43.800]  or religions but as soon as a statement quote constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility
[03:49:43.800 --> 03:49:49.880]  or violence it must be banned so in other words if you discriminate against oh i don't know for
[03:49:49.880 --> 03:49:56.360]  example a belief system that condones stoning women to death or throwing gays off buildings
[03:49:56.360 --> 03:50:03.560]  then that's discrimination and that is not allowed under this definition of hate speech
[03:50:03.560 --> 03:50:11.080]  which has been created which has been contrived by the united nations and then adopted globally
[03:50:12.280 --> 03:50:18.280]  they claim to be defending your free speech they claim to afford you these great human
[03:50:18.280 --> 03:50:25.080]  rights and when you actually drill down into the details free speech which offends someone
[03:50:25.080 --> 03:50:30.920]  which discriminates against their religious beliefs is hate speech it will not be allowed it will be
[03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:36.360]  banned which is exactly what they're they've already introduced in facebook and twitter you know the
[03:50:36.360 --> 03:50:43.080]  option to report people because you disagree with their opinion or because they offended your religion
[03:50:43.080 --> 03:50:49.320]  they've already had those options in place for over a year now and they're simply codifying it
[03:50:49.320 --> 03:50:55.880]  with that EU enforcement arm to actually go after people who criticize this insane migrant policy
[03:50:55.880 --> 03:51:02.520]  will be back in the final segment of the alex joneshow in four wars dot com stay tuned my name

[03:54:25.240 --> 03:54:30.920]  final segment of the alex jones show live let's hit a final few news stories of course we've got the
[03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:37.880]  big massive controversy over harambe the gorilla now the debate is over whether they should have
[03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:44.600]  shot the grill the gorilla or not but what was most interesting in the immediate aftermath of
[03:54:44.600 --> 03:54:51.720]  this news story and in fact for hours afterwards these social justice warriors who are obsessed
[03:54:52.360 --> 03:54:59.000]  absolutely fixated with injecting identity politics into absolutely everything
[03:54:59.000 --> 03:55:06.840]  they blamed this little black boy falling into a gorilla pit and being saved who did they
[03:55:06.840 --> 03:55:14.040]  blame it on well white people of course and i in fact put out a tweet yesterday where all these
[03:55:14.040 --> 03:55:20.920]  individuals you know black lives matter activists sjw's rushed to blame the gorilla being shot on
[03:55:20.920 --> 03:55:27.560]  white privilege and you can see all these tweets on my twitter they were like the gorilla was only
[03:55:27.560 --> 03:55:33.320]  shot to save the white boy if this boy had been black they would have just left it to die that
[03:55:33.320 --> 03:55:41.000]  was the tone of the tweets of course the little boy in the gorilla pit was black his parents were
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:49.720]  black and yet immediately they sought to inject racial identity politics into a news story that
[03:55:49.720 --> 03:55:58.360]  had nothing whatsoever to do with race so you can go and check out those tweets on my twitter facebook
[03:55:58.360 --> 03:56:04.760]  using people's phones to listen in on what they're saying suggests professor the company says that it
[03:56:04.760 --> 03:56:09.640]  does use people's microphones but only to help them out of course that relates to the ambient
[03:56:09.640 --> 03:56:15.240]  background noise which they listen to to target you with ads we've been reporting on that since at
[03:56:15.240 --> 03:56:23.320]  least 2006 now a top professor's talking about it rt reports outrages dutch authorities give up to
[03:56:23.320 --> 03:56:31.000]  10 000 euros to refugees to go shopping some dutch residents are outraged have to find some
[03:56:32.680 --> 03:56:36.840]  all of them should be after finding out that a few cities have been offering as much as 10 000 euros
[03:56:36.840 --> 03:56:43.720]  to refugees to buy furniture and other necessities again people living on the doll on welfare in the
[03:56:43.720 --> 03:56:50.520]  netherlands won't even earn 10 000 euros a year these precious migrants are being handed it with a
[03:56:50.520 --> 03:56:56.520]  check as soon as they arrive they're being kicked out their own housing to accommodate these migrants
[03:56:56.520 --> 03:57:02.120]  but the dalai lama has come out and actually defended christian europe you know done the job
[03:57:02.120 --> 03:57:08.520]  that the islamist pope is supposed to do which he doesn't dalai lama warns against taking too many
[03:57:08.520 --> 03:57:13.880]  migrants arab domination migrants should return this is out of bright but the dalai lama has
[03:57:13.880 --> 03:57:17.960]  said there are too many migrants pouring into europe warning against the continent becoming
[03:57:17.960 --> 03:57:25.720]  arabis and claiming the solution is the eventual repatriation of migrants striking a somewhat
[03:57:25.720 --> 03:57:32.840]  different tone to the pope who of course a couple of weeks ago came out and said that isis was just
[03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:39.640]  like jesus just like jesus's disciples spreading their message across the middle east because i
[03:57:39.640 --> 03:57:47.480]  don't remember that bible passage where jesus's disciples beheaded people took women as sex slaves
[03:57:47.480 --> 03:57:53.880]  and forced people to pay a tax on pain of death if they didn't convert must have missed that bible
[03:57:53.880 --> 03:58:01.080]  verse there so the pope is you know open arms he's busy giving awards to his fellow massive
[03:58:01.080 --> 03:58:07.400]  hypocrite george cloney who has like five mansions but says that germany german villages of 70
[03:58:07.400 --> 03:58:14.760]  people should accept 700 migrants while he doesn't accept a single one into any of his five mansions
[03:58:14.760 --> 03:58:20.120]  with their eight nine ten empty bedrooms he's meeting with the pope while the pope invites
[03:58:20.120 --> 03:58:26.600]  this mass invasion of muslim migrants and it takes the dalai lama to actually defend christianity
