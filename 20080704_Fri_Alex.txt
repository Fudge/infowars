[01:59.600 --> 02:02.680]  if you've never been to Philadelphia it's one of the cooler cities out there
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.880]  folks I've been there a couple times I actually lived outside of Philadelphia
[02:06.880 --> 02:11.600]  in New Jersey for a couple months back in 2001 I believe I think it was like
[02:11.600 --> 02:14.640]  actually right after the attack that maybe a month after I'd moved out there
[02:14.640 --> 02:20.200]  and it's just a great city full of history very cool town lots of Masonic
[02:20.200 --> 02:24.400]  stuff to check out if you're into all the symbolism it's everywhere in there
[02:24.400 --> 02:28.360]  especially inside the museums so we're gonna have Philadelphia 9-11 truth on
[02:28.360 --> 02:32.600]  for a half an hour at half past this hour and then we're also going to have
[02:32.600 --> 02:39.420]  Bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com and he's gonna talk

[02:42.360 --> 02:48.300]  news. I think Counterpunch just did a new article on Dennis Kasinich and the
[02:48.300 --> 02:54.000]  fact that prior to Dennis putting out those 35 articles of impeachment Nancy
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.360]  Pelosi and APAC came into his office and offered him some kind of a by the way
[02:59.360 --> 03:04.880]  folks APAC is the biggest rally lobby if you don't know and offered him some
[03:04.880 --> 03:10.240]  sort of oh Dennis please just don't impeach don't put these articles out
[03:10.240 --> 03:13.440]  there and there'll be something in it for you so we're gonna go over that
[03:13.440 --> 03:18.520]  article as well Dennis Kasinich I think he's one of the heroes of the year
[03:18.520 --> 03:23.120]  obviously Ron Paul is up there but Dennis Kasinich didn't let it flicker out
[03:23.120 --> 03:28.720]  didn't let it fade out went for the throat okay 35 articles of impeachment I
[03:28.720 --> 03:32.960]  don't think it's been talked about enough I don't think it's been talked
[03:32.960 --> 03:38.080]  about enough okay and by the way folks I want to take your calls in this first

[09:51.200 --> 09:55.440]  relations member gets so flustered that he doesn't even know what he's saying
[09:55.440 --> 10:01.520]  when they confront him and ask him if this is going to be a thinly veiled
[10:01.520 --> 10:05.600]  uh threat that the united states might stage a terror attack in order to a
[10:05.600 --> 10:11.520]  right invade iran he says no no no no no it was a mock letter and what i was
[10:11.520 --> 10:16.240]  trying to say is the united states has in the past stage things and could stage
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.240]  an event to go into iran word for word what he just said
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.720]  it's unbelievable it's like double speed it's like as long as he denies that
[10:24.720 --> 10:28.480]  he's not agreeing with the guy he can agree with him
[10:28.480 --> 10:32.320]  and i want people to get this film over at prism plant dot tv and super high
[10:32.320 --> 10:36.720]  quality again the div x versions are all fixed uh if you're having any kind of
[10:36.720 --> 10:40.160]  problem i would say go to download dot com and now i get the latest version of
[10:40.160 --> 10:42.880]  the codex some people were saying they could only hear the audio that means
[10:42.880 --> 10:45.520]  you don't have the correct video codec you're probably running on windows two
[10:45.520 --> 10:50.240]  thousand or windows uh 98 possibly god or maybe even me
[10:50.240 --> 10:53.840]  god remember those days folks i guess they're not that far away i used to run
[10:53.840 --> 10:57.040]  on those operating systems too but xp and vista
[10:57.040 --> 11:00.400]  it's built into the latest windows media player it should play great
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.640]  again the quality is super high probably the highest we've ever offered
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.880]  any of alex jones's films in and the film again is
[11:08.880 --> 11:12.880]  unlike anything else alex jones has ever done
[11:12.880 --> 11:17.680]  ever ever ever in fact we should go and read some comments
[11:17.680 --> 11:20.800]  on what people are saying about truth rising i mean it was getting five stars
[11:20.800 --> 11:23.680]  all over the place it's spreading about it's
[11:23.680 --> 11:27.040]  unbelievable you know and uh for a brief second i want to talk
[11:27.040 --> 11:30.000]  about another movie i go on these file sharing networks
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.960]  quite a bit uh to get news documentaries pbs stuff

[12:23.680 --> 12:26.800]  really almost unheard of the top hollywood downloads
[12:26.800 --> 12:30.320]  in other words all the illegal rips out there don't get that many cedars

[13:45.520 --> 13:50.160]  wedding up at the thousand islands which is gorgeous by the way in new york
[13:50.160 --> 13:54.000]  and i'm riding with my friend who's now a school teacher at my old
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.200]  school that i went to and my other buddy who

[14:14.240 --> 14:18.160]  leguardia for about five years and i've had talks with this guy before and
[14:18.160 --> 14:21.280]  he's talked about the drills that they run and the times that they
[14:21.280 --> 14:24.640]  have been able to get explosives through or mock explosives and he says it's
[14:24.640 --> 14:27.520]  always a drill he's never caught a real terrorist out there but that's
[14:27.520 --> 14:31.840]  besides the point so back in 2002 when i'm talking about this stuff they had

[14:51.360 --> 14:53.920]  material and he's like this stuff is blowing my mind
[14:53.920 --> 14:58.160]  he was reading a couple of jim marz books uh they'd both seen

[15:10.960 --> 15:13.840]  what happened to me back in o2 when i was trying to get you to
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.240]  watch that movie so anyway we get up to the thousand islands

[16:13.680 --> 16:18.000]  was a totally republican wedding and by republican wedding i mean
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.440]  uh my friend who was getting married she worked for bataki's office for quite some
[16:21.440 --> 16:25.360]  time so did her her soon to be husband who she married

[16:29.120 --> 16:34.560]  total right wing nut job and it just it was it was funny you know
[16:34.560 --> 16:41.040]  the situation but me being me i gave her a stack of movies as the gift

[25:59.840 --> 26:03.760]  yo first of all he's the one that interviewed dylan
[26:03.760 --> 26:07.840]  apparently he's the producer of this piece i talked to him for about a half an
[26:07.840 --> 26:11.760]  hour uh when we were out in colorado and he's
[26:11.760 --> 26:15.600]  total scum um i'll say that right now i have no respect for the man
[26:15.600 --> 26:19.440]  he is a cover-up artist i guarantee this piece is not going to be fair
[26:19.440 --> 26:24.240]  they're going to explain to us how damage caused building seven come down
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.080]  whether that's true or not that's what he's going to explain that is his goal
[26:28.080 --> 26:32.960]  do not fool yourselves all right i've read a lot of these comments on
[26:32.960 --> 26:37.280]  uh blogger and even over on info wars about certain things and let me tell
[26:37.280 --> 26:39.600]  you something right now the bbc is not our friend
[26:39.600 --> 26:44.000]  stop acting like they're our friend okay because they're not
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.200]  the conspiracy files are not our friend
[26:49.200 --> 26:53.200]  when are you going to wake up people you you really think they're going to give
[26:53.200 --> 26:56.560]  a legit shot to us i mean really after that that horrifying
[26:56.560 --> 27:01.120]  hit piece of total lies let me let me give an example
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.840]  a really simple example of how they totally and completely distorted their
[27:05.840 --> 27:11.040]  first 9 11 special okay they go to they act like we all went to uh
[27:11.040 --> 27:17.120]  google maps or map quest and mapped out where indian lake was
[27:17.120 --> 27:22.080]  in relation to the flay 93 shanks will crash
[27:22.080 --> 27:28.720]  right remember that and they said yeah it's a six day mile drive but it's
[27:28.720 --> 27:34.960]  really only one to two miles away debunked no let's go over the real facts
[27:34.960 --> 27:38.560]  they didn't want to go over the fact there is no plane in an open field in
[27:38.560 --> 27:41.360]  shanksville pennsylvania period let me say it again
[27:41.360 --> 27:45.360]  there is no plane in an open field in shanksville pennsylvania
[27:45.360 --> 27:49.600]  there are no engines there are no pieces of fuselage
[27:49.600 --> 27:52.960]  there's nothing there isn't there's no bodies
[27:52.960 --> 27:57.360]  okay both ernie stall the mayor of shanksville when he got there
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.440]  was told that the plane disintegrated on impact into the ground okay that's what
[28:01.440 --> 28:05.200]  they told him the mayor of indian lake when he got
[28:05.200 --> 28:08.560]  there who we interviewed ourselves said he wouldn't have known a plane had
[28:08.560 --> 28:14.640]  crashed there unless they told him okay let me go over again
[28:14.640 --> 28:18.960]  even when lifetime network did their little flight 93 movie
[28:18.960 --> 28:23.200]  when the fbi agents get there they ask the firefighters where the plane is
[28:23.200 --> 28:26.640]  and the plane and they go we don't know maybe you can help us find it
[28:26.640 --> 28:32.960]  it's a plane it's a seven oh my god it's a jumbo jet oh my god
[28:32.960 --> 28:36.160]  and then you have these little smaller debris areas
[28:36.160 --> 28:40.880]  and then you have reports of smaller debris falling eight miles away
[28:40.880 --> 28:45.600]  over a mountain ridge in new baltimore let me say it again
[28:45.600 --> 28:49.920]  eight miles away over a mountain ridge in new
[28:49.920 --> 28:52.720]  baltimore

[35:01.280 --> 35:04.800]  activist on the line we have a member of philly 911 truth
[35:04.800 --> 35:08.160]  nick karanji and uh as i understand it they're out right
[35:08.160 --> 35:12.000]  now in front of uh where are you guys in philly right now doing actions
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  we're out on our independence mall which is about uh we're a thousand yards
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.280]  so away from independence hall because they've set up spree
[35:19.280 --> 35:23.120]  free speech zones down here and another violation of
[35:23.120 --> 35:26.480]  of everything that this country was founded on on on the birthday of this
[35:26.480 --> 35:29.920]  country it's a real travesty it's a real affront to
[35:29.920 --> 35:33.440]  everything that our forefathers and mothers fought for to bring to this
[35:33.440 --> 35:36.560]  country and um it was just really sad it i have a
[35:36.560 --> 35:40.320]  stinking feeling in my stomach right now but uh there is a there is a good
[35:40.320 --> 35:43.440]  deal of resistance out here we're seeing more this year than the last
[35:43.440 --> 35:47.600]  when we had our event um in the independence hall visitor center
[35:47.600 --> 35:51.920]  uh there are anti i guess anti-abortion folks there are
[35:51.920 --> 35:56.480]  uh freeman we have a budja mall folks and of course there's us with uh
[35:56.480 --> 35:59.440]  911 truth and there's also anti-war activists out here
[35:59.440 --> 36:03.360]  but um really what's happening is that they're they're requiring folks to
[36:03.360 --> 36:06.880]  permit it's not even a pre-speech zone is also duly so that
[36:06.880 --> 36:10.000]  you need to get a permit to be out here so we're we're sort of just piggybacking
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.760]  off of the the mamiya folks at at this point in time waiting until
[36:13.760 --> 36:16.960]  they come over to us and ask us for our papers
[36:16.960 --> 36:20.080]  yeah absolutely and it's just so encouraging to me that you guys are
[36:20.080 --> 36:23.520]  actually out there doing something showing that even though they are trying
[36:23.520 --> 36:26.720]  to restrict our free speech trying to restrict our freedoms
[36:26.720 --> 36:31.360]  as as free humanity man that's what that's what this is about it's about
[36:31.360 --> 36:36.160]  us being able to be secure in our persons and possessions
[36:36.160 --> 36:39.600]  and you know a government foreign by the people and we no longer have that
[36:39.600 --> 36:43.120]  we have uh restrictions on our first amendment you're not allowed to be near
[36:43.120 --> 36:46.480]  independence hall you have to be an independence mall apparently
[36:46.480 --> 36:50.480]  but i am glad you're on the scene of where some of the
[36:50.480 --> 36:53.760]  most encouraging things have happened in this history really when
[36:53.760 --> 36:58.800]  freemen broke away from a tyrannical system over 200 years ago
[36:58.800 --> 37:03.360]  right yeah it's definitely the case and um last week we just saw we saw another
[37:03.360 --> 37:07.680]  major action against the first amendment where uh this this local municipal
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.440]  government the police force arrested a gentleman for
[37:11.440 --> 37:14.880]  standing uh somewhere in the vicinity of the liberty bell
[37:14.880 --> 37:18.320]  and reading off uh verses out of the bible he was arrested
[37:18.320 --> 37:22.480]  and uh now that gentleman has since been banned from coming anywhere near
[37:22.480 --> 37:26.880]  independence mall or the liberty bell for one year one year for reading
[37:26.880 --> 37:29.920]  passages out of the bible for his free speech his first amendment
[37:29.920 --> 37:33.120]  yeah i actually got to interview him i think it was about two weeks ago when i
[37:33.120 --> 37:35.920]  was filling in for alex and it's just unbelievable
[37:35.920 --> 37:41.280]  that once again you know we're supposed to be able to go down the public streets
[37:41.280 --> 37:45.760]  and proclaim the truth that's that's what this country was founded on in fact
[37:45.760 --> 37:49.840]  you know martin luther king jr was so successful because he had people take to
[37:49.840 --> 37:52.880]  the streets and they were the ones handing out the pamphlets
[37:52.880 --> 37:56.800]  and the literature and it was person to person and now you look at what happens
[37:56.800 --> 38:00.320]  to we are change colorado when they're out in front of a walmart
[38:00.320 --> 38:04.720]  handing out dvds they're now being charged with peddling and pandering
[38:04.720 --> 38:08.560]  well they're not selling anything this is free speech and they're really
[38:08.560 --> 38:12.320]  they're really trying to push that out of our lives and say no no no free speech
[38:12.320 --> 38:15.520]  is really a privilege and we're going to allow you to do that in a certain
[38:15.520 --> 38:18.720]  place here's a nice pen here's your free speech zone
[38:18.720 --> 38:22.720]  and i'd like to i'd like to get your take on how we can change that how we can
[38:22.720 --> 38:26.960]  make sure that our entire country is a free speech zone
[38:26.960 --> 38:30.960]  make sure the entire country is a free speech on well isn't that the uh
[38:30.960 --> 38:35.280]  multi-trillion dollar question and the uh... all ten amendment question we need
[38:35.280 --> 38:37.760]  we really have to uh...
[38:37.760 --> 38:41.600]  you know build up resistance on a on a pragmatic level we have to we have to
[38:41.600 --> 38:42.800]  take back
[38:42.800 --> 38:46.320]  uh... the positions of of office and uh...
[38:46.320 --> 38:47.520]  you know that the
[38:47.520 --> 38:52.080]  means to the means to counteract all this improper legislation
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.760]  as well as to have the support of your local police department
[38:55.760 --> 38:59.360]  and just thought the general public at large and and the main way to really do
[38:59.360 --> 39:02.880]  that is of course through the info war but eventually it's going to have to get
[39:02.880 --> 39:04.400]  down to a very
[39:04.400 --> 39:08.800]  uh... you know practical level where people are in the seats of of uh...
[39:08.800 --> 39:10.960]  office where they are the judges on the bench
[39:10.960 --> 39:13.440]  where they are the uh... you know of course when you have it
[39:13.440 --> 39:17.280]  if you had a trial by jury nowadays will be a lot easier to defeat the anti
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.120]  you know free speech of legislation but it seems now that they've they've
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.360]  completely taken away the power of drill jury nullification by abolishing it
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.120]  almost all cases uh... this this uh... right to a jury so um...
[39:30.120 --> 39:33.120]  yet they put the power directly in the judge's hands so that they can ensure
[39:33.120 --> 39:34.280]  they get the payoff
[39:34.280 --> 39:36.560]  and that you have no chance of defending yourself
[39:36.560 --> 39:38.600]  it's the new america with a k
[39:38.600 --> 39:39.880]  and uh... right
[39:39.880 --> 39:40.800]  it's just
[39:40.800 --> 39:44.480]  it's sad to me but you know releasing this new film showing people that
[39:44.480 --> 39:46.360]  activists can make a difference
[39:46.360 --> 39:48.840]  and i mean you you nick are a huge activist
[39:48.840 --> 39:50.200]  why you list off
[39:50.200 --> 39:53.480]  some of the big wigs that you've actually confronted and got on film
[39:53.480 --> 39:57.400]  my favorite personally of course is the uh... bob graham confrontation
[39:57.400 --> 39:59.960]  and that's going to be in my new film off a little bit of me so
[39:59.960 --> 40:02.040]  when you go over some of the other people out there
[40:02.040 --> 40:04.200]  that you've been able to get
[40:04.200 --> 40:07.680]  well we've gotten to pretty much the whole clue of presidential candidate
[40:07.680 --> 40:08.800]  hillary
[40:08.800 --> 40:10.920]  barack
[40:10.920 --> 40:14.160]  juliani of course what really i tried to come into our city
[40:14.160 --> 40:17.960]  and uh... act like a philadelphia and get it at the philly cheesesteak it was
[40:17.960 --> 40:22.160]  it was so uh... and i mean hilarious for lack of a better term because it
[40:22.160 --> 40:25.640]  could not have you could not handle the level of resistance coming from the
[40:25.640 --> 40:29.600]  state that was only like six of us out there but we just we came him in
[40:29.600 --> 40:32.760]  and uh... we have to serve we want over the support of the crowd i mean most of
[40:32.760 --> 40:35.760]  his uh... is uh... most perfect supporters actually
[40:35.760 --> 40:39.560]  you know came on to our side because they understood that the first responders
[40:39.560 --> 40:43.680]  is a critical issue in that for somebody be that derelict in their duties
[40:43.680 --> 40:46.000]  out to not have uh... taken care of of
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.600]  you know city workers
[40:47.600 --> 40:51.000]  and all you know volunteer firefighters is just completely
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.280]  you know unheard of so
[40:52.280 --> 40:55.760]  we have to do here of the the absolute heroes of nine eleven by the way the
[40:55.760 --> 41:00.120]  people that literally went into the fires into the places where there was
[41:00.120 --> 41:02.000]  still molten metal
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  people who sacrificed limbs who have died of cancer
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.440]  who are now walking around breathing out of a bag in their lesson forty
[41:09.440 --> 41:12.520]  the real heroes yet he really spit on them didn't he
[41:12.520 --> 41:13.420]  he wrote it
[41:13.420 --> 41:17.240]  but the i i think the most important true squad to be honest are those that
[41:17.240 --> 41:22.080]  are more in the line of investigative journalism and really bob graham uh...
[41:22.080 --> 41:26.760]  was was more along that line because what the questions that we asked were
[41:26.760 --> 41:30.220]  were more to do with his personal involvement with randy glass the f
[41:30.220 --> 41:32.980]  the fb i a p f operative was undercover
[41:32.980 --> 41:34.720]  prior to nine eleven and tried to
[41:34.720 --> 41:38.280]  explodes the plot by argie about the most of them on the shore the world
[41:38.280 --> 41:42.760]  trade center and and uh... of course bob graham had full knowledge of this plot
[41:42.760 --> 41:45.840]  and he never committed to the proper channel so when we confronted him on
[41:45.840 --> 41:46.520]  that
[41:46.520 --> 41:48.680]  you know face-to-face and he denied it
[41:48.680 --> 41:52.520]  i mean it's just it's just a sheer testament to to the duplicity of of
[41:52.520 --> 41:53.880]  these people where they
[41:53.880 --> 41:56.000]  you know they say one thing on camera
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.240]  you know back in two thousand two and then you catch them again and and and
[41:59.240 --> 42:03.440]  more recent date and will completely deny it contrary to all the factual and
[42:03.440 --> 42:06.760]  videographers evidence i mean it's just amazing but
[42:06.760 --> 42:10.520]  uh... beyond beyond a bob graham uh... i think the willy brown confrontation was
[42:10.520 --> 42:11.120]  pretty
[42:11.120 --> 42:15.440]  effective as well because you saw you saw how he could not control his temper
[42:15.440 --> 42:17.680]  when he was when he was pressed with uh...
[42:17.680 --> 42:21.640]  you know the more pointing questions about who warned him specifically
[42:21.640 --> 42:24.880]  and uh... you know the nature of his activities on the morning of nine eleven
[42:24.880 --> 42:25.640]  he just
[42:25.640 --> 42:28.960]  he just couldn't uh... stand up to the fire i mean we we held his feet to the
[42:28.960 --> 42:32.440]  fire and he just uh... you know he burned down to a crisp to the point where
[42:32.440 --> 42:35.000]  and i could barely even keep his confidence and let's go over that you
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.120]  know it it was reported in the san francisco chronicle that he got a low key
[42:38.120 --> 42:40.280]  warning not to fly that morning
[42:40.280 --> 42:42.000]  now when he was pressed on that
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.840]  eventually he would say all i i i don't know anything about that that was
[42:45.840 --> 42:47.080]  misinformation
[42:47.080 --> 42:51.560]  dylan actually went on his radio show and was going to ask him but
[42:51.560 --> 42:54.600]  coincidentally willy brown was out that day and he had a substitute host so we
[42:54.600 --> 42:58.040]  never got that there and then you got to ask him
[42:58.040 --> 43:01.080]  and you know i didn't even the i mean i mean you guys got to ask about the night
[43:01.080 --> 43:04.760]  i i i didn't deny that the fact that he did not have a specific warning he said
[43:04.760 --> 43:08.600]  the report of the warning that you're referring to is a standard warning that
[43:08.600 --> 43:10.160]  comes up washington
[43:10.160 --> 43:12.280]  every morning that's what he said
[43:12.280 --> 43:16.840]  and and we couldn't even you know really uh...
[43:16.840 --> 43:20.560]  final final way to to deal with that because it would be in the article it
[43:20.560 --> 43:24.560]  says that he got a low key early warning and they have to understand the two of
[43:24.560 --> 43:26.640]  the two reporters that uh...
[43:26.640 --> 43:30.360]  you know wrote the story up meteor and ross were actually embedded with uh...
[43:30.360 --> 43:33.160]  the mayor on the day of nine or they were you know they were running around the
[43:33.160 --> 43:36.160]  city with him as he conducted his emergency operation
[43:36.160 --> 43:38.840]  so for him to you know try to contradict
[43:38.840 --> 43:40.680]  verbatim what was told
[43:40.680 --> 43:44.760]  to these reporters is just completely absurd and you can really see the anger
[43:44.760 --> 43:47.720]  in his face by the way i mean folks if you haven't seen them and when we
[43:47.720 --> 43:50.920]  eat it well first of all he tried to really even deny the existence of the
[43:50.920 --> 43:54.280]  words in the article and then my uh... mark peters one of my
[43:54.280 --> 43:56.400]  my compatriots read it off verbatim
[43:56.400 --> 44:00.800]  and it's just faith just drops into the incredulous expression and uh... you
[44:00.800 --> 44:03.480]  know toward the end of it another one of our guys is put
[44:03.480 --> 44:06.960]  it's a book signing so he just put the article right on the desk
[44:06.960 --> 44:09.360]  so i mean that that that really
[44:09.360 --> 44:13.520]  you know added insult to injury and and i'm sure really brown camp i think you
[44:13.520 --> 44:16.000]  did cancel quite a few of his book tours because i was
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.720]  trying to encourage folks to go off
[44:17.720 --> 44:19.920]  you know after more pressing questions but
[44:19.920 --> 44:23.720]  it looks that it looks as if you never need to be cut a short of about one
[44:23.720 --> 44:25.360]  week after ours
[44:25.360 --> 44:28.840]  and that's what's key is that we keep the pressure on these guys that we don't
[44:28.840 --> 44:30.680]  let them just go off and
[44:30.680 --> 44:33.040]  spew their propaganda
[44:33.040 --> 44:36.480]  without any resistance whatsoever i mean look what's happened to all of the
[44:36.480 --> 44:37.720]  north recently
[44:37.720 --> 44:40.920]  you know look what happened to bill clinton everywhere you know bill clinton
[44:40.920 --> 44:42.200]  a couple days ago
[44:42.200 --> 44:46.040]  he said that he is looking forward at least he said this it was uh... it was
[44:46.040 --> 44:48.360]  a blurb on cnn i guess mckinna
[44:48.360 --> 44:53.040]  one of his uh... staff said that bill clinton was ready to uh... campaign with
[44:53.040 --> 44:54.520]  and for
[44:54.520 --> 44:57.880]  barack obama so he wants to go on tour with them
[44:57.880 --> 45:01.200]  that's what's important to see people understand why this guy's not even the
[45:01.200 --> 45:05.440]  president anymore no but he still heavily involved in politics he has
[45:05.440 --> 45:08.080]  a huge influential base
[45:08.080 --> 45:12.400]  and his wife is involved in politics and still may be the nominee as vice
[45:12.400 --> 45:13.760]  president so it is
[45:13.760 --> 45:15.120]  very important
[45:15.120 --> 45:18.080]  that we don't stop our efforts but we double our efforts
[45:18.080 --> 45:19.680]  and hopefully you know nine eleven
[45:19.680 --> 45:22.400]  chronicles part two is going to be truth revolution
[45:22.400 --> 45:23.520]  you know what i mean or
[45:23.520 --> 45:26.720]  you know finally we got our constitution back i don't know what part two is
[45:26.720 --> 45:29.320]  going to be it's up to us to make the part two
[45:29.320 --> 45:32.320]  you know what i'm saying that it's up to us to bring these guys to justice
[45:32.320 --> 45:35.000]  it's up to us to support people like dennis kasinich
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.160]  who have the balls
[45:36.160 --> 45:39.400]  to bring thirty five articles of impeachment to this obvious criminal
[45:39.400 --> 45:42.200]  administration
[45:42.200 --> 45:45.520]  and uh... jason did you did you buy chance uh... get a chance an opportunity
[45:45.520 --> 45:49.240]  to review that article i submitted to you know i wasn't able to man i i was in
[45:49.240 --> 45:52.440]  the office till about one o'clock in the morning and we were having a server
[45:52.440 --> 45:53.800]  issues uh...
[45:53.800 --> 45:56.800]  you can only imagine what this office is like but i didn't get to i had to get
[45:56.800 --> 45:57.840]  some sleep before this
[45:57.840 --> 45:59.200]  but why don't you go over
[45:59.200 --> 46:02.160]  uh... what's going on out there it it i know you said that i thought i get a
[46:02.160 --> 46:07.000]  card well it's really it's really a pro pro for today of course because we have
[46:07.000 --> 46:08.440]  you know a celebration of the
[46:08.440 --> 46:12.160]  birth of this nation and then the eventual institution of of the
[46:12.160 --> 46:15.800]  competition on you know in seventeen eighty seven or seventeen eighty nine
[46:15.800 --> 46:16.800]  uh...
[46:16.800 --> 46:18.640]  and really what what we have it
[46:18.640 --> 46:22.440]  it happened to one of our members and and the issue was he had political
[46:22.440 --> 46:25.120]  signs on his personal property is home in
[46:25.120 --> 46:26.760]  belmar new jersey
[46:26.760 --> 46:29.720]  and uh... a look a local municipal order
[46:29.720 --> 46:34.000]  states that you cannot have any signs whatsoever on your local
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.160]  uh... on your property and uh... it's it's totally bizarre you would think
[46:38.160 --> 46:40.080]  because power are people to
[46:40.080 --> 46:44.080]  close to run for office like literally in the country you cannot have a hillary
[46:44.080 --> 46:48.200]  barack or even like a local candidates uh... advertisement on your property
[46:48.200 --> 46:49.960]  for political candidacy
[46:49.960 --> 46:51.320]  so i mean
[46:51.320 --> 46:55.640]  anyway in in in my friend to have no idea i mean he just he erected of uh...
[46:55.640 --> 47:00.760]  romp all sign what it was but anyhow that the a municipal worker the township
[47:00.760 --> 47:02.120]  zoning official
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.120]  you know by a little he actually has no trespassing signs posted on his property
[47:06.120 --> 47:09.280]  this fellow mister warburton comes on to his property
[47:09.280 --> 47:13.320]  that's peering into his windows and then eventually uh... when my friend comes
[47:13.320 --> 47:16.600]  to the door he serves them uh... with with a note to basically uh... i think
[47:16.600 --> 47:17.480]  verbally
[47:17.480 --> 47:20.640]  that and if you don't remove the sign you're going to be cited
[47:20.640 --> 47:22.520]  friend of the move the sign
[47:22.520 --> 47:24.760]  and actually uh... i think he's
[47:24.760 --> 47:27.720]  uh... week later he received a citation in the mail
[47:27.720 --> 47:31.400]  uh... for it's that it's an undiscribed amount but
[47:31.400 --> 47:33.280]  basically uh... from there he erects
[47:33.280 --> 47:37.200]  two more signs made i mean if you're four by eight romp all signs are major
[47:37.200 --> 47:39.320]  so we're talking a uh... four-byte
[47:39.320 --> 47:41.680]  a four-byte twenty four you know complex
[47:41.680 --> 47:44.280]  and uh... from there they
[47:44.280 --> 47:47.520]  issue citations and eventually he is summoned to court
[47:47.520 --> 47:51.640]  and when he gets the he went when he gets the court this is where really gets
[47:51.640 --> 47:53.780]  you know he did up
[47:53.780 --> 47:57.080]  he tries to determine what first of all you have all the constitutional
[47:57.080 --> 47:58.720]  laws about free speech
[47:58.720 --> 48:00.960]  he has uh... supreme court rulings
[48:00.960 --> 48:03.560]  of uh... particular cases where
[48:03.560 --> 48:08.200]  if it is first of all if if it's a political sign it has to be allowed
[48:08.200 --> 48:11.720]  uh... and second second of all he also has
[48:11.720 --> 48:13.440]  uh... one every guards
[48:13.440 --> 48:17.040]  if it is an issue is handled in the municipal court level that deals with
[48:17.040 --> 48:18.680]  constitutionality
[48:18.680 --> 48:20.400]  it has to be dismissed
[48:20.400 --> 48:23.160]  or it has to be transfer the federal court
[48:23.160 --> 48:24.600]  and when he brought this up
[48:24.600 --> 48:26.800]  to the judge during during the arraignment
[48:26.800 --> 48:30.720]  the judge tried to try to repeatedly stonewall and what allowed me to get on
[48:30.720 --> 48:33.160]  the record he finally did so
[48:33.160 --> 48:37.440]  and while at the same time of there's also another another issue wherein he's
[48:37.440 --> 48:40.960]  questioning the jurisdiction of the court in the first place because
[48:40.960 --> 48:43.640]  and actually uh... the gentleman just arrived right now thanks for pretty
[48:43.640 --> 48:45.160]  for briefly on the traffic
[48:45.160 --> 48:48.160]  and uh... he's questioning the jurisdiction of the court because
[48:48.160 --> 48:51.440]  you'll find that like we were like we were stating earlier is that
[48:51.440 --> 48:52.960]  courts no longer have
[48:52.960 --> 48:54.720]  trial by jury why is that
[48:54.720 --> 48:57.840]  it's because they're operating under a pseudo jurisdiction
[48:57.840 --> 49:00.920]  and uh... really what happens in the traffic of cases that he starts a
[49:00.920 --> 49:02.440]  question in the jurisdiction
[49:02.440 --> 49:04.320]  and he finds that uh...
[49:04.320 --> 49:05.000]  it will
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  and it was the question as follows
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.360]  is this going to be a jurisdiction under
[49:10.360 --> 49:13.760]  the common law or is it going to be a jurisdiction under admiral fee or
[49:13.760 --> 49:15.000]  military tribunal
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.440]  and uh... the judge
[49:16.440 --> 49:20.000]  says that it's not under admiral and it repeats a very sternly so then it
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.040]  comes down to well therefore
[49:22.040 --> 49:24.880]  it must be under the common law criminal a criminal prosecution under the
[49:24.880 --> 49:25.960]  common law
[49:25.960 --> 49:30.080]  and uh... the judge will not answer that that inquiry fever uses to do so we
[49:30.080 --> 49:31.280]  thought that
[49:31.280 --> 49:33.960]  that automatically takes the power out of his hands and it gives us to the
[49:33.960 --> 49:34.680]  state
[49:34.680 --> 49:37.320]  and uh... that's a shot he says shut up your done
[49:37.320 --> 49:40.600]  yeah exactly where could people find out information and support this guy
[49:40.600 --> 49:42.960]  where is there a website or what's going on
[49:42.960 --> 49:45.600]  uh... i thought the press release you know it's going to be it's going to be
[49:45.600 --> 49:49.160]  on n w o blogger unfortunately i was having internet issues my self last
[49:49.160 --> 49:52.920]  night to make it up there but n w o blogger dot com will have a story by
[49:52.920 --> 49:53.920]  this afternoon
[49:53.920 --> 49:57.000]  uh... and that the top of the gentleman is here right now but here's another
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.840]  thing i would i just want to get this on the air
[49:58.840 --> 50:02.040]  is that uh... after after the trial i mean he was
[50:02.040 --> 50:05.560]  basically adjourned for the day and and then it was going to go into a trial on
[50:05.560 --> 50:07.880]  that uh... month later or so
[50:07.880 --> 50:10.720]  uh... in the interim he decided to
[50:10.720 --> 50:14.800]  go and try to find the judges over both and this is the real scary part
[50:14.800 --> 50:18.480]  he did obtain a copy of the judges over both of what he discovered with that
[50:18.480 --> 50:20.840]  the judge did not where
[50:20.840 --> 50:24.040]  to defend and uphold the constitution of the united states
[50:24.040 --> 50:26.160]  or other things
[50:26.160 --> 50:28.400]  and i think that's a direct violation of
[50:28.400 --> 50:30.400]  uh... i don't think that i mean
[50:30.400 --> 50:31.880]  article
[50:31.880 --> 50:35.160]  absolutely nick we're going to come back one more final segment with filling

[52:13.840 --> 52:15.160]  how could it be
[52:15.160 --> 52:17.400]  it can't be some say
[52:17.400 --> 52:18.940]  but they can't deny it
[52:18.940 --> 52:23.240]  all the scientific for knowledge in the most ancient accurate truthful story
[52:23.240 --> 52:24.720]  book ever written
[52:24.720 --> 52:25.860]  for example
[52:25.860 --> 52:30.120]  a scientist by the name of spencer who live back in the eighteen hundreds made
[52:30.120 --> 52:34.600]  a then world discovery that there is only five known manifestations of the
[52:34.600 --> 52:37.720]  unknowable in existence only five
[52:37.720 --> 52:39.680]  in the very first line pin
[52:39.680 --> 52:44.360]  three thousand four hundred years ago in that book all five were made known
[52:44.360 --> 52:48.960]  ever heard of matthew fontane meray the founder of the science of oceanography
[52:48.960 --> 52:52.680]  he found that there were actual paths in the sea found them chartered them
[52:52.680 --> 52:57.160]  ship sail them today but guess where he found them first
[52:57.160 --> 53:00.660]  and guess what astronomers found after the invention of the
[53:00.660 --> 53:01.640]  telescope
[53:01.640 --> 53:03.000]  found it in the north
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.560]  a great empty space
[53:05.560 --> 53:07.920]  what did the book say about that
[53:07.920 --> 53:12.000]  then with that invention called the telescope they found that the stars
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.400]  cannot be numbered
[53:13.400 --> 53:16.960]  but in one fifty bc the scientists were numbering them
[53:16.960 --> 53:17.960]  today they don't
[53:17.960 --> 53:19.600]  they say they can't be
[53:19.600 --> 53:22.040]  can't be numbered but guess what the book said
[53:22.040 --> 53:23.920]  thousands of years ago
[53:23.920 --> 53:27.560]  it's called scientific for knowledge and those that don't want you to believe
[53:27.560 --> 53:28.760]  that book saying
[53:28.760 --> 53:31.040]  can't be no way don't listen to

[54:17.320 --> 54:22.320]  people sleeping in their shoes
[54:22.320 --> 54:26.320]  there's a warning sign on the road ahead
[54:26.320 --> 54:30.320]  there's a lot of people saying we'd be better off then
[54:30.320 --> 54:33.320]  don't feel like saying that I am a man
[54:33.320 --> 54:38.320]  so I try to forget any way I can
[54:38.320 --> 54:45.320]  keep on rockin' in the free world
[54:45.320 --> 54:49.320]  keep on rockin' in the free world
[54:49.320 --> 54:51.320]  I'm gonna keep on rockin'
[54:51.320 --> 54:53.320]  till it's free again
[54:53.320 --> 54:57.320]  because our country is far from the free world anymore folks
[54:57.320 --> 55:01.320]  with things like free speech and zones that are total oxymorons
[55:01.320 --> 55:05.320]  with an assault on the constitution and bill of rights like no other
[55:05.320 --> 55:08.320]  private detention centers
[55:08.320 --> 55:10.320]  with torture facilities
[55:10.320 --> 55:13.320]  we got a long way to go in this country
[55:13.320 --> 55:15.320]  if we want a free world again
[55:15.320 --> 55:17.320]  if we want to do it, it's up to us
[55:17.320 --> 55:20.320]  it's not sitting on our couch slurping down Jenny Light
[55:20.320 --> 55:23.320]  and watching sports although a lot of you are going to be doing that today
[55:23.320 --> 55:25.320]  it is the 4th of July I understand that
[55:25.320 --> 55:30.320]  but there are some of us out there that have dedicated a portion of Independence Day
[55:30.320 --> 55:33.320]  to reclaiming that independence that we
[55:33.320 --> 55:36.320]  we so desire many people still think they have
[55:36.320 --> 55:39.320]  but unfortunately they really just don't
[55:39.320 --> 55:43.320]  and I'm with Nick Carrangi of Philly 9-11 Truth
[55:43.320 --> 55:45.320]  where do we go from here?
[55:45.320 --> 55:49.320]  what's next? I know that I'm going to be down at ground zero on 9-11 Nick
[55:49.320 --> 55:51.320]  and you know there will be a bunch of us
[55:51.320 --> 55:53.320]  we're going to be handing out DVDs
[55:53.320 --> 55:55.320]  we've done this yearly
[55:55.320 --> 55:59.320]  people have talked about the Ron Paul march out in DC this summer as well
[55:59.320 --> 56:01.320]  but what can we do as a movement?
[56:01.320 --> 56:03.320]  one of the biggest things is probably to spread films
[56:03.320 --> 56:05.320]  like mine and like others
[56:05.320 --> 56:07.320]  especially this new one Truth Rising
[56:07.320 --> 56:09.320]  it's really an activist toolkit
[56:09.320 --> 56:11.320]  a how-to
[56:11.320 --> 56:15.320]  but what do you think? what's next for this movement?
[56:15.320 --> 56:17.320]  the real next steps for this movement
[56:17.320 --> 56:20.320]  and I made these remarks down at Bilderberg
[56:20.320 --> 56:22.320]  I believe is that we need to get more organized
[56:22.320 --> 56:26.320]  and it's not perhaps how summer postulating
[56:26.320 --> 56:28.320]  we don't need to be centrally organized
[56:28.320 --> 56:32.320]  we do need activist hubs, communication networks
[56:32.320 --> 56:35.320]  and I think that sites like InfoWars Social
[56:35.320 --> 56:40.320]  and RestoreTheRepublic.com are very good initiating steps toward that goal
[56:40.320 --> 56:42.320]  and what can be done really from there
[56:42.320 --> 56:45.320]  what we saw with the Ron Paul movement
[56:45.320 --> 56:47.320]  was sort of a degree of that
[56:47.320 --> 56:49.320]  we did see local groups consolidate
[56:49.320 --> 56:54.320]  but unfortunately ever since our president's campaign died out
[56:54.320 --> 56:57.320]  it really dissipated those local groups
[56:57.320 --> 57:00.320]  so we still have those contacts in essence
[57:00.320 --> 57:05.320]  it's just that they're kind of inert at this stage in time
[57:05.320 --> 57:07.320]  so what we have to do is take those people
[57:07.320 --> 57:09.320]  get them onto an information network
[57:09.320 --> 57:12.320]  where they can essentially organize locally more easily
[57:12.320 --> 57:17.320]  and at the same time there can be updates posted on a national level
[57:17.320 --> 57:19.320]  that's really where we're heading with this
[57:19.320 --> 57:22.320]  is that there is a national movement at this point in time
[57:22.320 --> 57:24.320]  but it's really autonomous working groups
[57:24.320 --> 57:25.320]  so we are change chapters
[57:25.320 --> 57:29.320]  although they do have a level of communication with one another
[57:29.320 --> 57:31.320]  and same with the 9-11 truth chapters in the Ron Paul groups
[57:31.320 --> 57:34.320]  they're still largely disconnected
[57:34.320 --> 57:36.320]  and that connection is vital to our success
[57:36.320 --> 57:39.320]  well I'm really hoping that campaignforliberty.org
[57:39.320 --> 57:43.320]  Ron Paul's new organization that's supposedly going to be putting
[57:43.320 --> 57:45.320]  people like us into office
[57:45.320 --> 57:48.320]  can really attract those that maybe are a bit disappointed
[57:48.320 --> 57:50.320]  that their president is no longer in the race
[57:50.320 --> 57:53.320]  but they have to realize they're the ones that have to step up
[57:53.320 --> 57:56.320]  step up, be a city councilman, be a state senator
[57:56.320 --> 57:59.320]  if your congressional district is open go for it
[57:59.320 --> 58:01.320]  no one else is going to do it for you
[58:01.320 --> 58:03.320]  and that's why I really like that organization
[58:03.320 --> 58:05.320]  they took that money, they put it there
[58:05.320 --> 58:08.320]  why don't you throw out your website one more time before you go Nick
[58:08.320 --> 58:12.320]  if you want to visit nwoblogger.com
[58:12.320 --> 58:14.320]  nwoblogger.com
[58:14.320 --> 58:19.320]  and just so we're clear the legal battle goes on with Mr. Matratia
[58:19.320 --> 58:21.320]  he has defeated that one case
[58:21.320 --> 58:23.320]  alright man I gotta go
[58:23.320 --> 58:25.320]  Alex Jones show thanks for joining us

[59:35.320 --> 59:37.320]  we're in a no holds bar information war

[59:41.320 --> 1:00:09.320]  to make the fight back to big brother
[1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:14.320]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome
[1:00:14.320 --> 1:00:16.320]  it is the fourth day of July
[1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:19.320]  independence day 2008
[1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:21.320]  I am not Alex Jones I am Jason Bermas
[1:00:21.320 --> 1:00:26.320]  guest hosting this fabulous fireworks filled day
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:28.320]  fun fireworks filled day
[1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:30.320]  I'm hoping to see some fireworks today
[1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:33.320]  let's see what Austin has to offer I'm sure it's going to be a good time
[1:00:33.320 --> 1:00:35.320]  truth rising has dropped
[1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:37.320]  and I want to read yet another review
[1:00:37.320 --> 1:00:39.320]  because they're really pouring in folks
[1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:42.320]  and then we're going to get Bob Chapman on the line
[1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:45.320]  and we're going to have him on from the international forecaster.com
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:49.320]  just finished watching it very neat
[1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:51.320]  best movie so far energizing fun attitude
[1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:54.320]  that makes it watchable for ignorant folks
[1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:57.320]  Luke became a historical figure at this point
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:00.320]  by the way who is that girl who confronted Giuliani
[1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:03.320]  if you talk about courage that was the perfect example
[1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:06.320]  amazing that's Sabrina by the way
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:09.320]  yeah I will continue to talk about 9-11-2
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:12.320]  as long as I live we'll bring them to justice
[1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:16.320]  there are many ways to do it eventually the real perpetrators will fail
[1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:19.320]  also if they have all the power behind them
[1:01:19.320 --> 1:01:21.320]  all the grunt and military force all the money
[1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:23.320]  all arrogant fake news puppets
[1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:25.320]  they are not real
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:28.320]  they are little pitiful demons without souls
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:30.320]  they just can do anything about it
[1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:33.320]  they just can't do anything about the real truth movement
[1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:35.320]  people are so powerful and energizing
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:38.320]  when they know they fight for the right side
[1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:41.320]  no power how great so ever
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:43.320]  can do anything to fight that
[1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:45.320]  truth and power and independent thought
[1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:47.320]  will eventually pour into the minds of everyone
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:49.320]  we shouldn't feel as victims
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:51.320]  but as powerful fighters for the truth force
[1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:53.320]  the good spirit of the human race
[1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:55.320]  truth and power to the people
[1:01:55.320 --> 1:01:57.320]  misery and pain to the corrupted souls
[1:01:57.320 --> 1:01:59.320]  of the new world order
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:02.320]  awesome review awesome review
[1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:05.320]  and like I said you can get this at high quality
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:07.320]  almost DVD quality and folks
[1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:10.320]  I encoded these myself to make sure
[1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:12.320]  that they were good stuff
[1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:14.320]  the 699 megabyte one
[1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:16.320]  I think it's 680 actually
[1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:18.320]  it's okay it's the lowest of the DIVX
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:20.320]  but still looks amazing
[1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:22.320]  but the other two
[1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:25.320]  there's not much difference between the 830 megabyte and the gig file
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:27.320]  and like I said you burn that right to disk
[1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:29.320]  throw it on your DIVX DVD player
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:32.320]  you're literally watching it on your new plasma screen television
[1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:34.320]  with your friends and family
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:37.320]  while you're downing nachos and watching the football game
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:39.320]  actually there's no football right now
[1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.320]  so you're probably watching baseball
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.320]  I'd be watching baseball too it's a sunny day
[1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:45.320]  it's nice
[1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:47.320]  Luke Radowski gonna be on later
[1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:49.320]  and you know
[1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:51.320]  when you see somebody like Luke come
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:53.320]  as far as he has
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:55.320]  it's just so so
[1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:57.320]  encouraging
[1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:00.320]  again this is somebody who was part of New York 9-11 truth
[1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:02.320]  wanted to do even more
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:04.320]  he said you know what these
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:06.320]  these meetings aren't as effective as I'd like them to be
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:08.320]  and to the same people
[1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:11.320]  we're not reaching as many as many as I'd like
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:13.320]  so he made connections
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:15.320]  he got big signs
[1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:17.320]  he got a dedicated core
[1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:19.320]  and he went down to ground zero
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:21.320]  every single weekend
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:23.320]  okay
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:25.320]  then in 2006
[1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:27.320]  after we went down
[1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:29.320]  and we handed out 10,000 DVDs of loose change
[1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:33.320]  we had 2,000 people
[1:03:33.320 --> 1:03:35.320]  and investigate 9-11 shirts
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:37.320]  Luke said you know what it's time to start my own organization
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:40.320]  let us be
[1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:42.320]  the change that we want to see in the world
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:45.320]  and over the last two years
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:47.320]  Luke Radowski has done
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:49.320]  incredible and amazing things
[1:03:49.320 --> 1:03:51.320]  and they are chronicled
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:53.320]  in this new film truth rising
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:55.320]  again
[1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:57.320]  it just shows the power of one person
[1:03:57.320 --> 1:03:59.320]  there is no one out there listening
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:01.320]  right now that can't do something
[1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:03.320]  that can't put forward their talent
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:05.320]  that can't take the time to get a video camera
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:07.320]  to go to an event
[1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:09.320]  to ask a tough question
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:11.320]  to hold these criminals feet to the flames
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:13.320]  that's what needs to be done
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:15.320]  we need to keep pressing and pressing and pressing
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:17.320]  and that's why we just had Nick Karanjian
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:19.320]  because you could hear in the background at times
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:21.320]  from the crowds
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:23.320]  and a free speech zone doesn't stop him
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:25.320]  he's still right across from
[1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:27.320]  Independence Hall in Philadelphia
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:29.320]  speaking the truth
[1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:31.320]  talking 9-11
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:33.320]  and we got to do that
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:35.320]  they're bringing it up again folks
[1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:37.320]  Bush says he wants to capture bin Laden
[1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:39.320]  this story is not going away

[1:04:55.320 --> 1:04:57.320]  how about chlorides, dyes, ethanol
[1:04:57.320 --> 1:04:59.320]  sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes

[1:06:11.320 --> 1:06:13.320]  is the day that we have
[1:06:13.320 --> 1:06:15.320]  allowed the seeds of despotism to grow
[1:06:15.320 --> 1:06:17.320]  at our own door

[1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:11.320]  it uses more gas than I can afford

[1:07:53.320 --> 1:07:55.320]  deep behind enemy lines
[1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:57.320]  the information war continues
[1:07:57.320 --> 1:07:59.320]  it's Alex Jones
[1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:01.320]  and the GCN radio network

[1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:11.320]  so we're going to
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:13.320]  I'm going to read this BBC thing
[1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:15.320]  just to explain again to those that don't get it
[1:08:15.320 --> 1:08:17.320]  that a big hit piece is coming
[1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:19.320]  and then we're going to take your calls
[1:08:19.320 --> 1:08:21.320]  we're going to go to Leo, Steve, Mario, Mark and more
[1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:25.320]  the evolution of a conspiracy theory
[1:08:25.320 --> 1:08:27.320]  a large number of Americans question what happened
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:29.320]  that day
[1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:31.320]  it wasn't part of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11
[1:08:31.320 --> 1:08:33.320]  the third World Trade Center tower
[1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:35.320]  that wasn't hit by planes also fell
[1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:37.320]  as a report into the tower
[1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:39.320]  7 prepares to publish its finding
[1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:41.320]  Mike Rudin, total scum
[1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:43.320]  considers how the conspiracy theory
[1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:45.320]  got to be so big
[1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:47.320]  well because it happened because they blew the building up
[1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:49.320]  Mike
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:51.320]  he's got some snaggle teeth too
[1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:53.320]  I didn't want to bring that up but it was pretty
[1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:55.320]  disgusting he's a little taller than me
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:57.320]  so my eye line was like right in his gross mouth
[1:08:57.320 --> 1:08:59.320]  he was very, very pompous
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:01.320]  oh I've been to Iraq
[1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:03.320]  Jason and
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:05.320]  he was very leftist too like he was trying to be my friend
[1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:07.320]  but really just a total weasel in the snake
[1:09:07.320 --> 1:09:09.320]  9-11 is a conspiracy theory
[1:09:09.320 --> 1:09:11.320]  of the internet age
[1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:13.320]  put 9-11 conspiracy into Google
[1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:15.320]  and you get 7.9 million hits
[1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:17.320]  put in 9-11 truth and you get more than 22 million
[1:09:17.320 --> 1:09:19.320]  opinion polls in the US
[1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:21.320]  have picked up widespread doubts among the American people
[1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:23.320]  a New York Times
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:25.320]  CBS News poll in 2006
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:27.320]  found that 53% of those that question
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:29.320]  thought the Bush administration was hiding something
[1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:31.320]  another US poll
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:33.320]  found a third of those questions
[1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:35.320]  thought the government officials either assisted in the 9-11 attacks
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:37.320]  or allowed them to happen
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:39.320]  absolutely proven
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:41.320]  in the UK a survey by the BBC's
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:43.320]  conspiracy files carried out in
[1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:45.320]  something in 2006
[1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:47.320]  found that 16% of those questions
[1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:49.320]  thought there was a wider conspiracy
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:51.320]  that included the American government
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:53.320]  of course there was
[1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:55.320]  for a very good reason a lot of people
[1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:57.320]  are very suspicious about what went down that day
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:09:59.320]  Dylan Avery director of loose change
[1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:01.320]  the BBC and the missing tape
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:03.320]  this summer will be a key moment
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:05.320]  for those who question the official explanation
[1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:07.320]  of what happened on 9-11
[1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:09.320]  no it won't, okay
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:11.320]  this summer won't be a key moment
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:13.320]  it'll be a key moment for the liars
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:15.320]  like yourself Mike Rudin
[1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:17.320]  where you can pat yourself on the back
[1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:19.320]  and go up and say look
[1:10:19.320 --> 1:10:21.320]  we explained it
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:23.320]  it was fire all along
[1:10:23.320 --> 1:10:25.320]  they're crazy
[1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:27.320]  oh
[1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:29.320]  we're the BBC
[1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:31.320]  we're the number one stunner
[1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:33.320]  believe us, that's what's going to happen
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:35.320]  and so this Sandar guy is going to put out
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:37.320]  his NIST report and it's going to be bull
[1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:39.320]  oh man
[1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:41.320]  man
[1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:43.320]  nearly 7 years after the terrible events
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:45.320]  of September that day
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:47.320]  authorities are due to publish the final report
[1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:49.320]  on the third tower that also collapsed on 9-11
[1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:51.320]  unlike the twin towers
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:53.320]  this 47 story 610 foot skyscraper
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:55.320]  was not hit by a plane
[1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:57.320]  and tower 7 has become a key issue
[1:10:57.320 --> 1:10:59.320]  for truthers like Dylan Avery
[1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:01.320]  the director of the internet film 9-11
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:03.320]  called loose change
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:05.320]  the truth movement is heavily centered
[1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:07.320]  on building 7 and for very good reason
[1:11:07.320 --> 1:11:09.320]  a lot of people are very suspicious about
[1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:11.320]  what went down that day he says
[1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:13.320]  again as they should be
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:15.320]  8Center7's location Avery points out
[1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:17.320]  that tower 7 has some unusual tenants
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:19.320]  it did, the CIA, the Secret Service, the Pentagon
[1:11:19.320 --> 1:11:21.320]  and the very agency
[1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:23.320]  meant to deal with the disasters or terrorist attacks
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:25.320]  in New York, the office of emergency management
[1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:27.320]  and some people think tower 7
[1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:29.320]  was the place where 9-11 conspiracy
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:31.320]  was hatched
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:33.320]  no one said that, hold on
[1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:35.320]  who said that building 7 was where the 9-11
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:37.320]  conspiracy was hatched
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:39.320]  total bull
[1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:41.320]  total lies
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:43.320]  see again, all you people out there
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:45.320]  that think that the BBC is your friend
[1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:47.320]  they're not your friend
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:49.320]  they just pointed something out
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:51.320]  that no one said
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:53.320]  if someone had said that, it would be a quote
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:55.320]  okay
[1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:57.320]  it would say, this man said that that's where
[1:11:57.320 --> 1:11:59.320]  the 9-11 conspiracy was hatched
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:01.320]  building 7, no one said that
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:03.320]  that's so ridiculous
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:09.320]  alright, you know what, I'm done reading it
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:11.320]  because if you really do believe
[1:12:11.320 --> 1:12:13.320]  that Dr. Schein-Sunder
[1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:15.320]  is going to tell you the truth
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:17.320]  that this NIST report is right
[1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:19.320]  you know, it's not
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:21.320]  okay
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:23.320]  it's just going to be total bull
[1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:25.320]  alright, let's take a look
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:27.320]  Leo in mass, how you doing man?
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:29.320]  Hi, hi, great to catch up with you
[1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:31.320]  I'll give you my critique
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:33.320]  on the 9-11
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:35.320]  rising afterwards
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:37.320]  but I was thinking it would be kind of neat
[1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:39.320]  you know, since
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:41.320]  Alex and you guys are
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:43.320]  such a prolific bunch of filmmakers
[1:12:43.320 --> 1:12:45.320]  that we should
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:47.320]  you know, those of us who like
[1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:49.320]  are willing to contribute a fair amount of extra money
[1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:51.320]  should be able to get
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:53.320]  the Alex Jones
[1:12:53.320 --> 1:12:55.320]  version of the Oscar
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:57.320]  I could have a little Alex to put on my mantle piece
[1:12:57.320 --> 1:12:59.320]  no, I am dead serious
[1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:01.320]  about this
[1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:03.320]  we've got to permeate the culture in all aspects
[1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:05.320]  so what do you think we should do?
[1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:07.320]  I gave a hundred dollars to Alex
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:09.320]  and look what I got, I got an Alex
[1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:11.320]  well you know what, there is like a little
[1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:13.320]  little little, it's not even really that good
[1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:15.320]  but it's like this Canadian toy of Alex
[1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:17.320]  where it kind of looks goofy and it's like a bendy toy
[1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:19.320]  no, I want something that mimics the Oscars
[1:13:19.320 --> 1:13:21.320]  the Oscar that you could put on a mantle piece
[1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:23.320]  something that's not worthy of a mantle piece
[1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:25.320]  and you guys make it up, create it
[1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:27.320]  and then those of us who want to give big money
[1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:29.320]  can get extra amount of them or whatever
[1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:31.320]  alright, I'll bring it up with a man
[1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:33.320]  so what did you think of the film?
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:35.320]  number one
[1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:37.320]  I have a 768 DSL
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:39.320]  the cheap Verizon $18
[1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:41.320]  a month one
[1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:43.320]  7 hours to load
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:45.320]  ok, now this is
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:47.320]  as far as loading, could oh yeah
[1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:49.320]  could we have more slides
[1:13:49.320 --> 1:13:51.320]  and cut the thing and subtitles
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:53.320]  we've got to have subtitles, I could just barely understand it
[1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:55.320]  I have a full
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:57.320]  understanding of English and I could hear it
[1:13:57.320 --> 1:13:59.320]  but really most people
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:01.320]  a lot of people are not going to get the background
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:03.320]  noise
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:05.320]  and subtitles are absolutely imperative
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:07.320]  maybe
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:09.320]  you could somehow throw it into the website
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:11.320]  so that you don't have to
[1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:13.320]  I know there's subtitles on some of the things
[1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:15.320]  but if you watch the low quality flash version
[1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:17.320]  and even the low quality flash version
[1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:19.320]  is like a gig so yeah, it would take forever to load
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:21.320]  I did the Windows media
[1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:23.320]  the WMV, well that one's probably the lowest quality
[1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:25.320]  out of all of them
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:27.320]  and if you look like I know there's parts where
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:29.320]  the bomb in the bag, that's all on the bottom
[1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:31.320]  the thing is this
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:33.320]  in order to load quickly
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:35.320]  if you did it with slides
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:37.320]  and audio with a subtitle
[1:14:37.320 --> 1:14:39.320]  wouldn't that take out a lot of sections
[1:14:39.320 --> 1:14:41.320]  that could be just slides
[1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:43.320]  now when you have the camera moving around
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:45.320]  it's very distracting, it's hard to focus
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:47.320]  it's annoying
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:49.320]  when you do it so often
[1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:51.320]  just have a slide of the person
[1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:53.320]  and I think it would be kind of funny to do like
[1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:55.320]  where's the South Park
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:57.320]  where the mouth goes open
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:14:59.320]  alright Leo, I gotta let you go
[1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:01.320]  hold on, hold on
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:03.320]  I'd like to see the timing of it
[1:15:03.320 --> 1:15:05.320]  so that
[1:15:05.320 --> 1:15:07.320]  we are here now
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:09.320]  and like the last 10 minutes of the movie was great
[1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:11.320]  I loved it
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:13.320]  the rest of it was kind of like oh yeah, I know all that stuff
[1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:15.320]  but you know the thing is this
[1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:17.320]  we start out with where we are now with the police state
[1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:19.320]  what we were like before
[1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:21.320]  back in the 60s and 70s
[1:15:21.320 --> 1:15:23.320]  and how do we get here
[1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:25.320]  and more bios on the deceased
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:27.320]  show the good police
[1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:29.320]  versus the government power sites
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:31.320]  and how people can tell signs of the NWO
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:33.320]  in their town or city
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:35.320]  and what they can do locally
[1:15:35.320 --> 1:15:37.320]  these are the important aspects
[1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:39.320]  that should be in the film
[1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:41.320]  or on an interactive website
[1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:43.320]  for that specific film
[1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:45.320]  so people can refer to the website
[1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:47.320]  and then do the interactive stuff
[1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:49.320]  alright Leo, thanks for the info
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:51.320]  I'll pass it along, let's go to Steve in Colorado
[1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:53.320]  Steve, are you with me?
[1:15:53.320 --> 1:15:55.320]  yeah hi there Jason
[1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:57.320]  hey I didn't catch the very first part of the program
[1:15:57.320 --> 1:15:59.320]  are you
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:01.320]  one of the loose change producers
[1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:03.320]  is that correct? yeah
[1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:05.320]  did you guys do anything, I haven't seen it yet
[1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:07.320]  did you do anything on
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:09.320]  Ted Olson who I guess
[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:11.320]  if I remember I used to be the solicitor general
[1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:13.320]  of the US
[1:16:13.320 --> 1:16:15.320]  on his part in
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:17.320]  I guess faked phone calls from
[1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:19.320]  well we didn't go into it
[1:16:19.320 --> 1:16:21.320]  in detail but I do believe
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:23.320]  that in the final cut we do mention Barbara Olson
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:25.320]  who was the husband of Ted Olson
[1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:27.320]  Ted Olson gets a quick cameo
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:29.320]  but what you're discussing is that he went on television
[1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:31.320]  and he first said that his wife
[1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:33.320]  had called him from the plane
[1:16:33.320 --> 1:16:35.320]  now at first they said that
[1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:37.320]  it was from a cell phone
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:39.320]  and that you know then
[1:16:39.320 --> 1:16:41.320]  they kind of backtracked and said no it was from an air form
[1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:43.320]  but she had told him that she couldn't find
[1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:45.320]  her purse which would have made it
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:47.320]  impossible for her to call from an air phone
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:49.320]  because you would have needed a credit card to do so
[1:16:49.320 --> 1:16:51.320]  correct?
[1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:53.320]  and we didn't cover that specific
[1:16:53.320 --> 1:16:55.320]  aspect of it but we did mention that
[1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:57.320]  Barbara Olson who was this CNN
[1:16:57.320 --> 1:16:59.320]  reporter and the husband of
[1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:01.320]  I'm sorry the wife of
[1:17:01.320 --> 1:17:03.320]  Solicitor General you know Ted Olson
[1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:05.320]  we did bring up that fact
[1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:07.320]  she was kind of a high profile
[1:17:07.320 --> 1:17:09.320]  person
[1:17:09.320 --> 1:17:11.320]  I can't remember exactly what her background
[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:13.320]  was but yeah she was pretty well known
[1:17:13.320 --> 1:17:15.320]  from what I remember
[1:17:15.320 --> 1:17:17.320]  and then also the
[1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:19.320]  second thing I had was
[1:17:19.320 --> 1:17:21.320]  do you know like you were mentioning about the different
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:23.320]  offices that were in Building 7
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:25.320]  do you know of that kind of thing
[1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:27.320]  for the Pentagon of why
[1:17:27.320 --> 1:17:29.320]  whatever it was
[1:17:29.320 --> 1:17:31.320]  the one that you're talking about the wing that got hit
[1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:33.320]  right? well the wing that got hit was
[1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:35.320]  totally under renovation there was barely anybody
[1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:37.320]  in that wing and we do know
[1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:39.320]  that April Gallup you know
[1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:41.320]  crawled out of the hole there and that she was
[1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:43.320]  doing some pretty classified work
[1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:45.320]  that morning I mean we haven't interviewed with her
[1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:47.320]  we haven't put it out but
[1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:49.320]  basically she says she was dealing with classified
[1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:51.320]  documents and that when she turned
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:53.320]  on the computer that's where the attack happened
[1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:55.320]  so there was some operations going there
[1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:57.320]  going on there I would doubt that we'll ever
[1:17:57.320 --> 1:17:59.320]  find out what they were because anything
[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:01.320]  above top secret you know there's just
[1:18:01.320 --> 1:18:03.320]  it's not going to hit the public however
[1:18:03.320 --> 1:18:05.320]  sure however I will say
[1:18:05.320 --> 1:18:07.320]  this you know Donald Roncel was safe on the other side
[1:18:07.320 --> 1:18:09.320]  this would have been the weakest
[1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:11.320]  place to hit the Pentagon unless it was
[1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:13.320]  an inside job because again it hit none
[1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:15.320]  of the main offices most of it was evacuated
[1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:17.320]  there wasn't a big death toll
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:19.320]  and it's kind of odd
[1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:21.320]  that they knew about this plane
[1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:23.320]  quote-unquote supposedly going into the White House
[1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:25.320]  and then into this is supposedly
[1:18:25.320 --> 1:18:27.320]  the one that hit the Pentagon and they didn't warn anybody
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:29.320]  there were no alarm bells going off
[1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:31.320]  yet they evacuated Cheney and
[1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:33.320]  Mineta and they're both in the POC
[1:18:33.320 --> 1:18:35.320]  before this happens
[1:18:35.320 --> 1:18:37.320]  yeah okay I was going to bring that up the
[1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:39.320]  part that I guess is on YouTube
[1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:41.320]  or the video excuse me that's on
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:43.320]  YouTube that has the
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:45.320]  actual
[1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:47.320]  testimony of Norm Mineta before
[1:18:47.320 --> 1:18:49.320]  the 9-11 commission
[1:18:49.320 --> 1:18:51.320]  okay was that where was that
[1:18:51.320 --> 1:18:53.320]  okay yeah we was talking about that
[1:18:53.320 --> 1:18:55.320]  do you guys include that per chance
[1:18:55.320 --> 1:18:57.320]  oh yeah that's in loose change final cut man you can go
[1:18:57.320 --> 1:18:59.320]  watch it for free at google video right now you get
[1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:01.320]  the high quality thing over at prison planet
[1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:03.320]  or infowars but yeah that's absolutely in there
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:05.320]  and he confirmed he confirmed that
[1:19:05.320 --> 1:19:07.320]  two other times in fact over
[1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:09.320]  at my blog loosechange911.com
[1:19:09.320 --> 1:19:11.320]  actually have Mineta saying the same exact story
[1:19:11.320 --> 1:19:13.320]  five separate times
[1:19:13.320 --> 1:19:15.320]  on five different occasions one year after the fact
[1:19:15.320 --> 1:19:17.320]  on ABC in front of the 9-11
[1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:19.320]  commission in front of a we are change
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:21.320]  group and on yet another special on CNN
[1:19:21.320 --> 1:19:23.320]  so it's well documented
[1:19:23.320 --> 1:19:25.320]  they just covered it all up in the 9-11
[1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:27.320]  commission and said Cheney wasn't there till 955
[1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:29.320]  believe your government Steve I thank you for the call

[1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:55.320]  through the authority that has been
[1:20:55.320 --> 1:20:57.320]  delegated to us it is time to destroy
[1:20:57.320 --> 1:20:59.320]  the destroyers the number of the
[1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:01.320]  mounted troops was 200 million
[1:21:01.320 --> 1:21:03.320]  the vast majority of the population of the
[1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:05.320]  US though the people of the US
[1:21:05.320 --> 1:21:07.320]  where their numbers and influence are
[1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:09.320]  strongest have primary responsibility
[1:21:09.320 --> 1:21:11.320]  for reigning the man and bringing them to
[1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:13.320]  justice all nations will participate

[1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:19.320]  proponents of the new world order

[1:21:23.320 --> 1:21:25.320]  that was disinherited 2000 years ago

[1:21:33.320 --> 1:21:35.320]  the destruction of the earth and mankind
[1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:37.320]  we will undo through the authority

[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:25.320]  Hopefully coming at you.
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:26.880]  September 1st, fabled enemies.
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:27.880]  Get ready.
[1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:29.480]  It's going to have the Barry Jennings interview.
[1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:34.080]  Very successful story here at infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:41.200]  Over 50,000 views on YouTube in just a couple of weeks, less than two weeks, I think, in
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:43.640]  dozens of different versions.
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:47.560]  But today is the launch of Truth Rising.
[1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:51.640]  We launched a little early yesterday, but this is the official launch, and we're all
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:54.800]  really proud of this film here.
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:55.800]  Myself included.
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:25:00.760]  I had very little to do with it, but I did actually design the DVD cover and that sort
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:07.240]  of thing and watch as Rob Jacobson edited it for the last couple of months, really checking
[1:25:07.240 --> 1:25:10.440]  it out and pointing out, you know, how well it's done.
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:12.320]  I mean, it's cinema verite.
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:17.240]  It is just truly different from anything Alex Jones has ever put out before with interviews
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:23.960]  with people like Jesse Ventura, Willie Nelson, Martin Sheen, George Carlin, Rosie O'Donnell,
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:25.640]  Christine Ebersol.
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:28.240]  This film is unlike anything.
[1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:30.720]  I think the movement has ever seen.
[1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:34.480]  I mean, it really is just an excellent, excellent movie.
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:39.720]  And before we jump to your calls, I want to take time to thank our sponsors.

[1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:59.960]  to be drinking all day, you might want to pop a little bit of this with your Brewskis.
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:01.360]  Keep you up so you don't fall asleep.
[1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:07.720]  Then again, I know we got some pretty big warriors out there on the 4th of July.
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:08.720]  Try to be careful too, folks.
[1:27:08.720 --> 1:27:11.960]  I haven't said that, but drinking and driving is not a good thing.
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:16.800]  That's not something we promote over here at infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:17.880]  We want you to be safe today.
[1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:21.120]  We do want you to have a good time.
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:24.880]  If you're a Prismplanet.tv member, we want you to download the movie in high-quality
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:29.440]  DivX format and play it on your DivX player, your DVD player.
[1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:31.400]  Just don't play DivX these days.
[1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:32.400]  Share this info with your family.
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:33.400]  Today is the day.
[1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:35.400]  I said it earlier today, and I'm going to say it again.
[1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:36.600]  You're going to see your friends.
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:37.960]  You're going to see your family.
[1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:39.280]  This information is vital.
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:41.440]  We don't really know how much time we have.
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:46.200]  We need to educate people that Barack Obama is not going to save the world.
[1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:47.200]  Did you know that?
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:49.240]  Yeah, Barack's not saving the world.
[1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:50.920]  Get with it.
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:51.920]  Get hip to it.
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:53.440]  Clinton's about to campaign for the man.
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:54.920]  Clinton is not a good person.
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:57.240]  All right, let's jump to these other callers.
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:27:59.120]  Let's go to Mark in Georgia.
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:00.120]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:01.120]  Well, a few things.
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:04.760]  I'll try and hit them in a rapid sequence here.
[1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:07.200]  I was dealing with his erstwhile friend.
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:09.360]  He's not very well-educated.
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:13.400]  I told him he was a sicko, but he thought I was paying him a compliment, and he called
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:15.040]  me a paranoid Schizophrenic.
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:20.240]  I don't even know what the word Schizophrenic really means, but I said, well, the thing
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:24.720]  is, you're an Aletheaphobe.
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:32.080]  It's a person with a morbid irrational fear of the truth, Aletheap means truth in Greek.
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:34.840]  I think that some of these people need a ramp.
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:35.840]  They hit the wall.
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:37.240]  They need a ramp or a stairwell.
[1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:42.960]  They can climb up that explains to them kind of an introductory thing.
[1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:47.440]  Your project is the thing that woke me up, and I thank you for that.
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:53.760]  I was thinking, with Mark Dice's, a number of points that I'd hit in rapid sequence
[1:28:53.760 --> 1:29:00.560]  with Mark Dice's thing of Informa Soldier, I appreciate that he wants to send them information,
[1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:05.600]  but I'm thinking along the lines that if we could put together a specific project that
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:10.440]  explains to the soldiers about their oath of office, and that on 10th, I hear these
[1:29:10.440 --> 1:29:15.240]  neocons talk about the 10th of September mentality, and I just sent in a rebuttal.
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:16.240]  All right, hold on, Mark.
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:17.240]  We're going to stay with you.
[1:29:17.240 --> 1:29:18.240]  Hold over.
[1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:19.240]  We're going to have you on the other side.
[1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:20.440]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:21.640]  It is independent state.
[1:29:21.640 --> 1:29:27.360]  Truth Rising has dropped over at PrismPlanet.tv, and we'll be back after this is the GCN Radio
[1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:41.160]  Network.
[1:29:41.160 --> 1:29:42.440]  We're on the march.
[1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:44.840]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:48.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:51.040]  Hi.
[1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:52.600]  This is Brother Michael Diamond.
[1:29:52.600 --> 1:29:56.440]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic
[1:29:56.440 --> 1:29:58.680]  Church in the last 50 years.
[1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:03.440]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened,
[1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:06.960]  and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[1:30:06.960 --> 1:30:12.120]  The package contains six DVDs that contain 10 different programs, two books that combined
[1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:14.880]  over a thousand pages and other information.
[1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:22.440]  Order now at our website, mostholyfamilymonastery.com, that's mostholyfamilymonastery.com.

[1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:40.840]  or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, New York, 14735.
[1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:47.480]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10, $15 for UPS Ground
[1:30:47.480 --> 1:30:50.480]  or $30 outside the U.S.
[1:30:50.480 --> 1:30:56.240]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground's Herald,
[1:30:56.240 --> 1:30:59.640]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:30:59.640 --> 1:31:04.920]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:31:04.920 --> 1:31:06.440]  to tell their story.
[1:31:06.440 --> 1:31:15.520]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:31:15.520 --> 1:31:20.280]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:31:20.280 --> 1:31:22.560]  take action against their global masters.
[1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:25.720]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:31.560]  He takes his hand off, and you hear a 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:31:31.560 --> 1:31:38.480]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide, download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and
[1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:43.600]  aggressively spread it worldwide, or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:47.280]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:50.080]  and bring in martial law.
[1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:53.280]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:58.880]  American Free Press, the only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[1:31:58.880 --> 1:32:03.960]  American Free Press, written by patriots, for patriots.
[1:32:03.960 --> 1:32:06.760]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[1:32:06.760 --> 1:32:09.440]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:11.680]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:14.680]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:20.080]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists, and the whole Council
[1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:22.720]  on Foreign Relations gang head on.
[1:32:22.720 --> 1:32:27.160]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from American Free Press.

[1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:38.360]  It's just like it sounds.
[1:32:38.360 --> 1:32:41.360]  American Free Press, all one word,.net.
[1:32:41.360 --> 1:32:45.200]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[1:32:45.200 --> 1:33:07.360]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[1:33:07.360 --> 1:33:12.640]  Happy Fourth of July to all of you out there, to the Alex Jones Show, the launch of Truth
[1:33:12.640 --> 1:33:13.640]  Rising.
[1:33:13.640 --> 1:33:17.840]  It's over at PrisonPlanet.tv right now, and the highest of quality.
[1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:22.640]  You can get it on DivX, burn it to DVD, play it on your DivX DVD player.
[1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:23.640]  It's that simple.
[1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:27.200]  It's getting that much easier to fight the Info War.
[1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:30.820]  We've got Mark and George on the line, and he was discussing some other projects, possibly
[1:33:30.820 --> 1:33:37.240]  one directed directly at the soldiers to show them exactly what's happened to the military
[1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:38.240]  and themselves.
[1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:39.240]  Continue, Mark.
[1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:46.640]  Yes, when I was in the Weekend Warrior at Tarleton Air Force Base, I saw in the latrine,
[1:33:46.640 --> 1:33:52.560]  and I'm going to modify this for obvious reasons, that a lifer is a lazy ignorant fornicator
[1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:53.560]  expecting retirement.
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:58.840]  Now, as we understand it now, and I mentioned this to Colonel Bowman when he was in town
[1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:04.640]  recently about the crash of the Pentagon, it's like, yeah, the records that they needed
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:08.040]  to find out where the money went was right where the plane hit.
[1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:09.840]  They're like, oh, really?
[1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:16.240]  So here's these guys expecting retirement, and it's like, even if you were having grossly
[1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:21.960]  inflated currency for your retirement, you expect the money's going to be there.
[1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:27.440]  You know, I'd like to see about getting officer-friendly Jack McLam involved in terms of reminding
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:33.280]  them of their oath of office that it is the enemy domestic that we need to contend with.
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:40.280]  I tried to tell my Aletheophobic mother about there's a tract, actually it's a couple of
[1:34:40.280 --> 1:34:41.280]  tracks that were combined.
[1:34:41.280 --> 1:34:45.800]  It's a couple of articles that were combined into a tract called Foundations Pay the Way
[1:34:45.800 --> 1:34:51.800]  by Alan Stang, and I put it on my, basically converted it to a PDF format and uploaded it
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:52.800]  to my site.
[1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:53.800]  It's available.
[1:34:53.800 --> 1:35:03.440]  Do YouLoveJesus.org, that's letter U, Flash, FoundationsWithACapitalF.PDF, that's Papa
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:09.440]  Delta Foxtrot or Portable Document Format, and so that tract is available, and I believe
[1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:16.280]  that if the people are in uniform, whether in the civil authorities here in the United
[1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:23.120]  States or overseas, or wherever they may be, need to be reminded that the enemy domestic
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:28.600]  that I think maybe we ought to put the material together where the Founding Fathers explained
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:34.280]  in this project, where the Founding Fathers warned that the real threat would be corruption
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:35.280]  from within.
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:38.600]  That's right, the Republic could only fall from the inside, Mark, I thank you from the
[1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:39.600]  call.
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:44.080]  I mean, so many people said, look, if this government goes down, it's going to be from
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:45.880]  people on the inside.
[1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:48.880]  It's not going to be from an outside threat, and boy were they right.
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:50.680]  Let's go to Carl in Texas.
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:51.680]  Carl, what's on your mind?
[1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:54.440]  Yes, sir, Jason, you're doing a great job.
[1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:59.040]  I've got a new slant on Building 7, it's maybe not new, but I have not heard a lot of people
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:00.040]  talk about it.
[1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:01.040]  All right, go ahead.
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:05.520]  With Larry Silverstein saying that we've had such a loss of life and we decided we
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:12.080]  should just pull, even with that, that doesn't ever add up, because if you know a little
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:20.320]  bit about demolition, it takes days or months to design a demo.
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:25.120]  It takes months to install the demo.
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:31.160]  For him to get on TV and say, well, we just decided to pull it that day of, it's totally
[1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:37.520]  incredulous and totally, there's no way you can rig a building to be pulled the day of.
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:40.600]  I don't necessarily think that he said, let's rig it for demolition.
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:42.360]  He probably knew it was rigged for demolition.
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:45.000]  No, he said we decided to pull it.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.400]  Yeah, well, exactly, but if it already had the bombs in the building and he knew that,
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:55.000]  say, it had a contingency plan, I mean, this was Secret Service, Office of Emergency Management.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:59.600]  This took months to prepare and I don't think that gets hammered home enough to people that
[1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:00.600]  don't understand.
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:01.600]  No, I agree.
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:02.600]  It did take months to prepare.
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:04.320]  Those bombs were prepositioned.
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:07.600]  Larry Silverstein wasn't the one that put the bombs in the building.
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:12.280]  He obviously, I think, was aware that there were explosives in the building.
[1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:16.360]  I do believe that it's not going to matter, because the BBC is going to tell us the building
[1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:17.360]  fell from fire.
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:21.160]  In two days from now, the BBC is going to solve the mystery of 9-11, which they're calling
[1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:25.400]  the final mystery, which it is far from, since there are thousands of contradictions in the
[1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:27.960]  official version, especially building 7.
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:31.280]  But we should all go back to sleep and just believe Mike Rudin, the total scumbag from
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:32.280]  the BBC.
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:33.280]  Oh, yeah.
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:38.880]  But no, just anybody out there that's got half a mind or doubt in this, think about how
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:40.480]  long it would take to prepare this.
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:46.520]  I mean, you're talking about drilling probably 50 holes per floor, 2,300 holes in concrete
[1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:47.520]  columns.
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:49.840]  That takes a long time to set up.
[1:37:49.840 --> 1:37:54.760]  You know, now that you brought that up, I want to bring up yet another piece of evidence
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:37:55.760]  for demolition.
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:37:56.760]  And I thank you for the call, Carl.
[1:37:56.760 --> 1:37:58.760]  We're going to take more callers in a moment.
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:03.960]  But in the beginning of Truth Rising, there's a shot of the World Trade Center Cross.
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:08.360]  Now for you, for those out there that don't know what the World Trade Center Cross is,
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:15.080]  it is a piece of the building, two pieces of steel, that were somehow fused together
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:21.040]  in the form of a cross at the site of Ground Zero, not by man, but by the demolition of
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:23.640]  World Trade Center, one or two, underground zero.
[1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:29.560]  And it also had moltenized iron or another form metal, didn't look like aluminum to me.
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:32.720]  It might have been some other than iron.
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:34.600]  But anyway, it was hanging off the side.
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:35.800]  Now all of this had been moltenized.
[1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:40.800]  You've got to understand, two steel beams being fused together, fused together in the
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:45.840]  shape of a cross doesn't happen from jet fuel, okay?
[1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:47.760]  It happens from high temperatures.
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:53.840]  Now again, the official version people will say there's no proof of molten metal underneath.
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:54.840]  There's none.
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:59.840]  I'm John Grossonist and I don't know of anybody who saw any molten metal.
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:05.080]  You know, though we reported it, though the fires ran until late December, I mean, though
[1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:09.280]  we have molten metal pouring out of the World Trade Center prior to its collapse, none of
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:11.040]  it's real, apparently.
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:16.480]  Apparently, we all imagined it and somehow it formed itself, but it's all due to the
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:17.480]  official version.
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:18.640]  These people make me sick.
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:24.200]  The thermal imagery shows that the intense hot spots could not have been created by jet
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:25.200]  fuel fires.
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:26.200]  Okay?
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:27.480]  John Gross doesn't want to look at those.
[1:39:27.480 --> 1:39:29.200]  So that's the NASA imagery.
[1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:30.200]  Okay, folks?
[1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:31.200]  God.
[1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:32.760]  When are we going to rise up?
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:37.760]  You know, if you're listening right now and you got a little time on this 4th of July,
[1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:42.360]  you've already seen Truth Rising, or you haven't seen Truth Rising, either way, you
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:46.240]  need to email this guy at the BBC and just let him know the jig's up.
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:49.360]  And he's like, oh, I need you to preserve judgment till after the show.
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:52.360]  No, you really don't because I know what your game is.
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:54.120]  It's about lying and distorting the truth.
[1:39:54.120 --> 1:39:55.120]  And you're sickening me.
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:57.200]  All right, let's go to Chris in Kentucky.
[1:39:57.200 --> 1:39:58.200]  Chris, are you there?
[1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:00.200]  Chris, are you with me?
[1:40:00.200 --> 1:40:02.200]  Do I not have Chris?
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:03.200]  Hello, Jason.
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:04.200]  Hey, what's up, Chris?
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:06.280]  Hey, thanks for waking me up as well.
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:07.280]  No problem.
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:10.960]  There's a couple of news items here in the state of Kentucky that came up a few days
[1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:15.800]  ago that since the high price of gas is getting so expensive to the taxpayers, well, the Kentucky
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:18.640]  State Police wanted safe gas by having roadblocks.
[1:40:18.640 --> 1:40:20.640]  Have you heard that in any other state as well?
[1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:21.640]  Wait a minute.
[1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:22.640]  They want what?
[1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:23.640]  For roadblocks?
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:24.640]  State gas?
[1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:25.640]  What are they going to do?
[1:40:25.640 --> 1:40:27.800]  Block off the entryways to other states so people can get it cheaper?
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:31.800]  So they can just, you know, so, you know, they can go to the most dangerous roads with
[1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:36.760]  the spokesman of the Kentucky State Police that on a newscast at 84 WHS here in Louisville.
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:40.200]  When I heard that, I think, what are they conditioning?
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:41.200]  What are they up to?
[1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:46.880]  Well, let me tell you just, not only the gas, but the price of living has gone up so much.
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:48.840]  Now, I'm in Texas.
[1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:50.160]  Regular gas is still under $4.
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:51.160]  That's just in New York.
[1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:53.920]  Regular gas was like $4.35 at upstate New York.
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:57.520]  That means it's close to $5, maybe $5.50 down in the city.
[1:40:57.520 --> 1:41:01.040]  Now on top of that, they just up the price of cigarettes in New York.
[1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:02.480]  So again, I'm in upstate New York.
[1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:04.080]  I think it's like $7.50 a pack.
[1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:05.080]  I don't even smoke.
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:08.120]  My friends are complaining to me, down in the city, it's $10.
[1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:12.400]  I mean, can you imagine, $10 for a pack of smokes, $5 for a gallon of gas.
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:17.480]  Anybody who drives and smokes now has an extra, especially if you smoke a pack a day, I got
[1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:23.360]  to figure you're spending an extra $100 to $200 a week on garbage, on lies.
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:28.640]  I mean, the tobacco companies lose lawsuits and then the taxpayers end up paying for it
[1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:32.520]  and the smokers just end up having to pay more to get cancer.
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:36.480]  I mean, the system is so twisted and then to say that you're not allowed to go get
[1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:38.520]  gas in another state because it's cheaper.
[1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:42.960]  I mean, people would be outraged if you did that in New York because, believe it or not,
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:46.880]  New Jersey still has much cheaper gas in New York City and the border is right there.
[1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:51.760]  I know a lot of people that go directly to Jersey because gas is about $1.52 cheaper.
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:56.440]  When they start regulating you by your license plate or where you're from stateside to get
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:41:59.240]  gas, yeah, that's scary stuff.
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:00.480]  I had not heard that story.
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:06.080]  I would suggest you email it over to AaronInFullWars.com or tipsinInFullWars.com.
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:07.080]  You got anything else for me, Chris?
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:08.080]  Yeah.
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:11.480]  It's also, we did have the newspaper here, The Courier Journal here in Louisville also
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:15.160]  now, so they're going to have massive roadblocks of checkpoints everywhere this weekend.
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:17.040]  So this is not freedom this weekend.
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:21.280]  No, it's definitely not and they'll all be in the light of drunk drivers and all this
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:22.780]  other stuff.
[1:42:22.780 --> 1:42:26.520]  I understand where people are like, well, we need to save lives.
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:31.640]  That's a holiday, but what we don't need is Fourth Amendment breaking checkpoints.
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:33.600]  If somebody is swerving on the road, that's great.
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:34.600]  Double the cops today.
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:35.600]  I have no problem with that.
[1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:36.600]  Right.
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:37.600]  Can that be checked?
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:38.600]  Yeah.
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:39.600]  Just don't stop us for no reason.
[1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:40.600]  Yeah, that's triple the cops today.
[1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:41.600]  Whatever.
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:42.600]  Have them on the lookout.
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:43.880]  There's enough rats out there anyway today.
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:46.880]  If someone swerves just slightly off the road, everybody's got a cell phone.
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:49.840]  I know plenty of people that call it in.
[1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:52.040]  There's no reason to have us stop.
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:53.040]  Let me see your papers.
[1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:54.040]  Okay.
[1:42:54.040 --> 1:42:55.040]  Get out of the car.
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:42:56.760]  You're not drunk or haven't done anything illegal.
[1:42:56.760 --> 1:42:58.720]  Oh, I see you don't have your seatbelt on.
[1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:00.040]  Well, there's a $200 fine.
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:01.040]  Here you go, sir.
[1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:02.360]  Just pull over for a moment.
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:04.560]  It's a total rape fest.
[1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:08.200]  That's what they're conditioning with this high-priced gas by just having the state police
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:09.200]  sit at checkpoint.
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:10.200]  Yeah, absolutely, man.
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:11.200]  All right.
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:12.200]  Thank you, Chris.
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:13.800]  We're going to jump to the next caller.
[1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:15.680]  Let's go to Louie in Texas.
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:16.680]  What's up, Louie?
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:17.680]  Hey.
[1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:18.680]  Hello?
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:19.680]  What's on your mind?
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:20.680]  Yes.
[1:43:20.680 --> 1:43:21.680]  What's on your mind?
[1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:22.680]  You're on there.
[1:43:22.680 --> 1:43:27.200]  Yeah, he's going to be on it one o'clock.
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:28.200]  Okay.
[1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:32.760]  I'm just wondering, one little thing I was thinking about is we're getting payments,
[1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:34.240]  you know, that refund check.
[1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:36.680]  Yeah, the $600 check.
[1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:40.400]  And then money from the state also if you're on a pension and things like that.
[1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:45.320]  Doesn't the Constitution require federal and states to pay what they owe in silver
[1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:46.320]  and gold?
[1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:49.520]  It doesn't have a class action action right there.
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:53.200]  Well, I think they changed that when they brought in the Federal Reserve Banking System,
[1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:54.200]  right?
[1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:55.200]  I'm pretty sure that's where it ended.
[1:43:55.200 --> 1:43:57.640]  I don't think they had a constitutional amendment for that.
[1:43:57.640 --> 1:43:58.640]  All right.
[1:43:58.640 --> 1:43:59.640]  Well, what do you want me to ask, Chapman?
[1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:00.640]  Because I'll be there.
[1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:05.480]  Well, ask him if there's a possibility to kickstart class actions in every state for
[1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:08.200]  any payment you get from the state or federal government.
[1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:09.640]  That is not silver or gold.
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:10.640]  All right.
[1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:11.640]  I'll ask him that, man.
[1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:12.640]  I thank you for the call.
[1:44:12.640 --> 1:44:14.640]  Let's jump to Joe in Pennsylvania.
[1:44:14.640 --> 1:44:15.640]  Joe, what's happening?
[1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:17.640]  Hey, how are you doing, Jason?
[1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:18.640]  Good, man.
[1:44:18.640 --> 1:44:24.080]  Listen, I gotta tell you, I downloaded, I'm a prison planet, do you remember, and I downloaded
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:30.520]  Truth Rise and about 20 minutes into it, I mean, I just started weaving because there's
[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:35.960]  so many people, you guys put so much effort into this and my heart goes out to all those
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:40.160]  people that were arguing back and forth and they don't realize that you guys are down
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:43.920]  there trying to help and they don't know.
[1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:45.720]  They don't know.
[1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:52.400]  And it's an incredible effort and it just made me want to, like I said, I've been on
[1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:56.080]  before, I'm in a wheelchair, I'm quadriplegic, and I want to get down there.
[1:44:56.080 --> 1:44:59.960]  And I don't know, I got some people here that may be able to bring me down into September
[1:44:59.960 --> 1:45:05.800]  11th, that's the one coming up, but it's a fantastic video.
[1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:08.360]  And not only that, there's so many more sources up there.
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:13.560]  These people, they call you guys Nutjob, Alex Jones is a Nutjob, they don't realize, like
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:19.320]  I go on the internet and I look at hundreds of sources of different people exposing the
[1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:26.000]  truth and that BBC guy that's going to supposedly discredit the Building 7 thing, he's going
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:32.240]  to look stupid because, you know, it's not just, there's so much information out there
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:39.800]  to the contrary, and I have people, you know, they're called sheeple, and I got guys in
[1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:47.320]  Iraq, a buddy of mine, just emailed me and said, I wished him a happy 4th of July, asked
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:51.920]  him how he was doing, and he said, you know, we don't need to be here, they need to get
[1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:56.360]  the US out because, he said, Afghans don't want them there, he said they're big, he
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:45:59.440]  said they're basically big targets, and they don't-
[1:45:59.440 --> 1:46:03.920]  Oh absolutely, but you know what, let me just stop you for a second, they have now set it
[1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:08.960]  up to make sure people understand that there is no getting out of Afghanistan, I mean,
[1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:13.920]  let's see, I did the show two weeks ago, a little over two weeks ago, and the big news
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:19.200]  on Friday was, oh, prison break, Kandahar prison break, a thousand people escaped, many of
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:24.360]  them Taliban, on Monday it was Taliban have a new stronghold in Afghanistan, and they've
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:28.240]  been hyping that up the past couple weeks, by Monday afternoon it was reported that the
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:32.800]  US forces gave the green light for that attack, and they may have even helped, well they did
[1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:36.920]  that because they're not going anywhere, they need an external threat, they need an enemy
[1:46:36.920 --> 1:46:41.800]  to fight, or people get hip to it, and just like your soldier friend, and you know that
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:45.160]  a lot of the soldiers know over there, there's no reason to be in Afghanistan other than
[1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:50.680]  to secure some rich guy's interest, I mean it's sad man, and I hope that movies like
[1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:55.560]  this one, show how we can make a difference over here, you know, we need to help those
[1:46:55.560 --> 1:46:59.400]  people over there, by making people aware over here, and you're right man, it does make
[1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:04.120]  me very very sad, and disheartened sometimes, when I'm talking to somebody and you're right,
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:08.680]  I'm trying to help, and they just don't get it, but I really feel like we can break through
[1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:10.080]  that facade, you know what I mean?
[1:47:10.080 --> 1:47:17.280]  Well I got up, they're coming home, and I am encouraging them to not re-enlist, and
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:21.800]  I want to show them the videos, and there was a kid, he came up to me, and he's like
[1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:25.880]  oh I just got a $30,000 a year job, I'm going into the military, and I said listen if it's
[1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:29.760]  about money, I said did you do your training, he said yeah I did my training, I said did
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:34.000]  you sign documents and all that, he said yeah, I said did they inoculate, and he's like
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  no, and I said well if it's just about the money, I said if you're not a patriot, go
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:41.600]  to Blackwater, they'll hire you for $100,000 a year, if you don't give a shit about your
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:42.600]  country, sorry.
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:48.640]  I got to let you go, hey I understand man, I understand, but gotta let you go after that.
[1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:52.480]  I feel your sentiment, I'm glad that you're a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber, I'm glad you
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:55.080]  dig the film, hope you spread it out to your friends.
[1:47:55.080 --> 1:47:59.360]  Alright, let's go to Jay in North Carolina, Jay what's the haps?
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:04.240]  Hey Jason, I just wanted to make a couple of comments, a friend of mine just called
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:10.160]  me, I'm an over the road truck driver, and she just called me from Washington, and she
[1:48:10.160 --> 1:48:17.240]  just went to her local Fourth of July parade, and they had a 9-11 truth float in the parade.
[1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:19.840]  That is awesome, where was this?
[1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:25.800]  It was in Tacoma Park, which is just a suburb of Washington DC, now I've been doing this
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:30.080]  since the 1-year anniversary, I've been handing out information, I've handed out over 8,000
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:39.360]  DVDs to people, we are winning people, we are winning this fight, and this movie I watched
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:43.080]  a little bit of last night, I couldn't get it to download, I'm on the road in my semi
[1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:48.280]  right now, I lost the signal, but I did watch some of it, and I believe this is gonna be
[1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:55.780]  a tool for us to energize us and get us motivated again, I've been up and down so many times
[1:48:55.780 --> 1:49:02.080]  that I've just wanted to quit, and then something will motivate me to just want to go that much
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:03.080]  harder.
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:08.640]  We hope that this movie is that, and we hope that this brings thousands of people to Ground
[1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:13.560]  Zero yet again this year, on the anniversary of 9-11, and just redoubles our efforts.
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:17.720]  We hope that it starts new chapters of We Are Change, we hope it starts other organizations,
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:22.240]  we hope it triples the activism in the next 6 months, I think that this movie can do that
[1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:23.240]  Jay.
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:27.880]  Listen, Jason, about a month and a half ago I drove through one of these Draw Your Blood
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:35.960]  Checkpoints down in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I was actually interviewed on a radio
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:41.320]  station for the whole hour about it, the whole situation was kind of weird, there was about
[1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:51.600]  200 police on I-40, they had I-40 shut down both ways, just east of Albuquerque, and they
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:57.160]  had, it was a four-lane road at that point, they had three lanes with checkpoints, and
[1:49:57.160 --> 1:49:59.160]  they had all semis left lane.
[1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:03.360]  Well, I got waved through this checkpoint, but as I was driving by it, I was looking
[1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:12.200]  at the scene, and they had four 3D, four long checkpoints with three officers at each one
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:20.160]  to check your car as you drove up to it, and then just past that they had a whole bunch
[1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:25.800]  of cops milling around, and then just past that down the exit ramp they had 10 ambulances,
[1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:30.880]  all with their doors open and all with their lights on, and then just past that they had
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:32.920]  about 200 impounded cars.
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:33.920]  Wow.
[1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:37.040]  Alright Jay, I gotta let you go, but it's a scary world we live in when they're taking
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:38.040]  your blood.
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:42.320]  It's not freedom folks, but it is the 4th of July, so let's declare our independence.
[1:50:42.320 --> 1:50:52.320]  That's the Alex Jones show, we'll be back after this.
[1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:56.680]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:50:58.960]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[1:50:58.960 --> 1:51:03.120]  Gas Freedom.info has the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:04.320]  have right now.
[1:51:04.320 --> 1:51:08.600]  Gas Freedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free energy device.
[1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:13.640]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called H-H-O.
[1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:18.640]  H-H-O, also called Brown's Gas, burns efficiently and provides the energy your car needs, and
[1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:21.880]  just 10 minutes you'll discover exactly how this is possible.
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:25.160]  This is the secret the oil and auto industry doesn't want you to know.
[1:51:25.160 --> 1:51:29.800]  Go to Gas Freedom.info to learn how easy it is to extract energy from water to run your
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:30.800]  car.

[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:50.920]  call today.
[1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:55.160]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:59.720]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:51:59.720 --> 1:52:05.680]  It's known as the Bilderberg, both their objective being world domination.
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:08.840]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:14.760]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:19.200]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:52:19.200 --> 1:52:24.640]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:28.480]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:31.240]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[1:52:31.240 --> 1:52:34.360]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:35.360]  They're after power.
[1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:36.560]  That's their app to use you.

[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:53.120]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[1:52:53.120 --> 1:52:55.560]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[1:52:55.560 --> 1:53:00.840]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel, and today I gave a killer presentation
[1:53:00.840 --> 1:53:06.280]  in Sydney, finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online
[1:53:06.280 --> 1:53:08.280]  from my desk with WebEx.
[1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:11.480]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[1:53:11.480 --> 1:53:15.440]  I just talk to clients on the phone, and they watch what's happening on my desktop from
[1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:20.560]  their desktop, so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[1:54:40.200 --> 1:54:49.320]  It's the Alex Jones show on Jason Bermas, my little website, LooseChange911.com.
[1:54:49.320 --> 1:54:53.320]  You can check out LooseChange's second edition, LooseChange's final cut over there.

[1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:02.080]  And we're going to have Bob Chapman on in the next hour, but I'm going to shoot through.
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:05.720]  I'm going to try to go through four calls, so we've got to make it quick, folks.
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:07.320]  Let's go to Archie in Portland.
[1:55:07.320 --> 1:55:08.320]  What's up, Archie?
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:10.320]  Hey, Jason.
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:11.320]  How you doing, man?
[1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:12.320]  I'm good.
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:14.320]  I will make it quick.
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:19.120]  I don't know if I haven't seen Truth Rising, but I did see LooseChange's final cut.
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:20.560]  I got it from my local library.
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:21.560]  Oh, awesome.
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:22.560]  Yeah, and it's really good.
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:27.240]  I like the way you guys sort of dropped some of the things that weren't provable and tightened
[1:55:27.240 --> 1:55:28.240]  it up.
[1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:29.240]  Very good presentation.
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:33.560]  I can't imagine anyone watching it and not being convinced that it was an inside job.
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:38.800]  To do that, I'm reading the 9-11 Commission Report, and you guys may have covered this
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:42.600]  on Alex's show or in the blog or somewhere, but I haven't heard it.
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:50.240]  On page 320, paragraph 136, it says, at about 9.57, an EMS paramedic approached the FDNY
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:55.840]  Chief of Department and advised an engineer in front of 7WTC had just remarked that Twin
[1:55:55.840 --> 1:55:58.840]  Towers, in fact, were an imminent danger of a total collapse.
[1:55:58.840 --> 1:56:00.600]  Who is this engineer?
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:02.400]  Who is the paramedic?
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:04.840]  I don't know if you guys have ever heard of that.
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:05.840]  No, that's a good question.
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:06.840]  I don't know.
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:12.640]  There's just so much disinfo about the times and what happened at 7, for instance.
[1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:18.040]  In that first FEMA report, they try to say that Barry Jennings and Michael Hess weren't
[1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:22.680]  in the building till after both planes had struck so that they can move the timeline
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:23.680]  over.
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:28.440]  So when they experienced that explosion in Building 7, they say it's the collapse of
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:29.440]  the first tower.
[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:32.600]  But the good thing is that the collapse of the first tower didn't really cause all that
[1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:35.360]  much damage to the South Face of 7.
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:40.120]  We now have video of the South Face of 7 and there's barely any windows even blown out.
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:41.120]  You know what I mean?
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:45.960]  Oh yeah, I felt that in the film, but I'm just saying, no one knew that they were going
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:46.960]  to come down.
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:47.960]  So how could there be an engineer?
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:50.560]  Well, someone did know and it wasn't an engineer, my friend.
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:56.800]  Let me also point out the fact that Rudy Giuliani, who was in 7 in the morning, that's why Michael
[1:56:56.800 --> 1:56:58.080]  Hess was there.
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:03.120]  He got moved out of there and then he got moved to a command center on Barkley Street.
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:07.320]  He got on with Peter Jennings and said that he had gotten a warning from someone, didn't
[1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:08.840]  say who it was.
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:14.320]  But then later on, I believe it was the 16th or 15th of September, he did an interview
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:18.840]  on 2020 with Barbara Walters where he revealed that Dick Cheney had indeed given him a call
[1:57:18.840 --> 1:57:19.840]  that morning.
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:23.560]  He didn't say Dick Cheney warned him the towers were going to fall, but he did say that Dick
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:24.560]  Cheney did call him.
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:30.560]  Now remember, Cheney's in the PEOC, he's the guy that's neck deep in this Pentagon situation.
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:36.280]  He's also the guy who basically probably was the most in the know that morning.
[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:38.480]  He's the one that knew about Air Force One's threat.
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:41.840]  He had called the president there, he didn't warn anybody in the Pentagon, he allowed the
[1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:42.840]  Pentagon strike.
[1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:47.800]  I think Cheney was the middleman that got the insiders that weren't in the know out.
[1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:51.400]  I think he's the guy that was saying, hey, you need to get out of there, they're about
[1:57:51.400 --> 1:57:53.800]  to blow those buildings up.
[1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:55.800]  I mean, that's my personal opinion.
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:57:58.240]  Well, thank you very much.
[1:57:58.240 --> 1:57:59.240]  You got it, brother.
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:00.240]  Hey, thanks for the call Archie.
[1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:01.560]  All right, let's jump to Fred infill.
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:02.560]  All right.
[1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:03.560]  We're already at the bottom.
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:09.440]  If you guys hold over, we'll try to take some calls while Bob Chapman is in internationalforecaster.com.
[1:58:09.440 --> 1:58:13.520]  We're going to be talking about the skyrocketing prices of oil.
[1:58:13.520 --> 1:58:18.680]  You know, the fact the economy's in the dubs, we're almost on parity with the peso folks.
[1:58:18.680 --> 1:58:32.360]  This is the Alex Jones show, prisonplanet.com.
[1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:38.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:38.360 --> 1:58:42.280]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:58:42.280 --> 1:58:47.680]  I've come with a message of information, 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:58:47.680 --> 1:58:49.400]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:58:49.400 --> 1:58:50.960]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:53.680]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[1:58:53.680 --> 1:58:57.680]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[1:58:57.680 --> 1:58:58.680]  They said that.
[1:58:58.680 --> 1:59:01.680]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:59:01.680 --> 1:59:02.680]  to grow at our own door.
[1:59:02.680 --> 1:59:03.680]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:59:03.680 --> 1:59:04.680]  An inside job.
[1:59:04.680 --> 1:59:05.680]  How dare you?
[1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:23.680]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:59:23.680 --> 1:59:26.680]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:59:26.680 --> 1:59:31.680]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[1:59:31.680 --> 1:59:32.680]  anniversary of 9-11.
[1:59:32.680 --> 1:59:37.680]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:59:37.680 --> 1:59:43.680]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:59:43.680 --> 1:59:53.680]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:53.680 --> 1:59:57.180]  Mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:59:57.180 --> 1:59:58.680]  You want answers?
[1:59:58.680 --> 2:00:00.680]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:00.680 --> 2:00:04.680]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:09.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:09.680 --> 2:00:11.680]  All right, folks, we are back.
[2:00:11.680 --> 2:00:12.680]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:12.680 --> 2:00:18.680]  I am Jason Thermas sitting in on this Independence Day this 4th of July.
[2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:21.680]  This fireworks Friday, if you will.
[2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:22.680]  Very exciting stuff.
[2:00:22.680 --> 2:00:29.680]  And joining me now is Bob Chapman of theinternationalforecaster.com in a time of great sorrow.
[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:31.680]  Great sorrow for this country.
[2:00:31.680 --> 2:00:34.680]  Our currency just continues to be devalued.
[2:00:34.680 --> 2:00:36.680]  Gas prices continue to shoot up.
[2:00:36.680 --> 2:00:41.680]  But even with all this, we still do have days like today where we are supposed to celebrate
[2:00:41.680 --> 2:00:44.680]  our independence or what we have left of it.
[2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:47.680]  What do we have left of our independence, Mr. Chapman?
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:49.680]  What do you think?
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:56.680]  I think very little considering what I witnessed as a young person in America.
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:01:00.680]  You know, the whole concept of freedom has been changed.
[2:01:00.680 --> 2:01:07.680]  We have laws today, the Patriot Acts, among other things, that allow the government to
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:12.680]  ferret into our lives and find out things that they have no right to know.
[2:01:12.680 --> 2:01:20.680]  And also, these laws have a great controlling factor on people within our society.
[2:01:20.680 --> 2:01:27.680]  And it has also moved our government from what used to be a Democratic Republic, a democracy,
[2:01:27.680 --> 2:01:35.680]  if you may, into the hands of people who believe that we should have a corporatist, nationalist,
[2:01:35.680 --> 2:01:38.680]  socialist, fascist government.
[2:01:38.680 --> 2:01:41.680]  And that's what it's evolved into, and that's what we've got.
[2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:47.680]  And people better get smart and realize it quickly because it's extremely dangerous to
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:52.680]  our freedom and everything else that we do in America.
[2:01:52.680 --> 2:01:54.680]  Absolutely.
[2:01:54.680 --> 2:01:59.680]  And, you know, days like today when we have a large audience, I really am hoping that when
[2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:04.680]  people go to, you know, their next barbecue, their family event, that this is on the table,
[2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:08.680]  that we're going to be talking about, you know, the fact that the country is in the dumps financially,
[2:02:08.680 --> 2:02:14.680]  to get out of, you know, the dollar, to get into hard currency like silver and gold.
[2:02:14.680 --> 2:02:20.680]  And also, to be aware that Barack Obama is not going to save you, John McCain and him pretty much play ball
[2:02:20.680 --> 2:02:22.680]  for the same folks.
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:28.680]  And that until we become the government again, until we go out there and take the seats of power,
[2:02:28.680 --> 2:02:31.680]  a government foreign by the people, until we go into our local communities and say,
[2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:35.680]  hey, I'm going to be the mayor, I'm going to be the city councilman, I'm going to be the governor,
[2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:39.680]  I'm going to be the congressman, I'm going to be the state senator, we're not going to change the system,
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:43.680]  you know, and that's why I'm enjoying what Ron Paul's doing with campaignforliberty.org.
[2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:46.680]  And I hope that this summer is a big awakening.
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:49.680]  That's why we released Truth Rising today on the 4th of July.
[2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:52.680]  I'm sure you haven't gotten a chance to see that yet, Bob, but we hope you do.
[2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:54.680]  Give it a look.
[2:02:54.680 --> 2:03:00.680]  And I hope we're motivated because we have to be, because this is not going to be an easy task, is it?
[2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:02.680]  No, it certainly isn't.
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:04.680]  It hasn't been for a long time.
[2:03:04.680 --> 2:03:09.680]  But I'll say this, that we've made great strides in informing people of what's going on.
[2:03:09.680 --> 2:03:15.680]  I remember in the early 60s, we were banging our heads against the wall.
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:25.680]  And guys like G. Edward Griffith and Gary Allen, who was my partner, and Alan Stang,
[2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:31.680]  you know, we did the best we could, but now, today, fortunately, we have a proliferation,
[2:03:31.680 --> 2:03:37.680]  but certainly not enough programs like this telling people, really, the truth about what's going on.
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:47.680]  And the internet has revolutionized our ability to reach people and tell them the truth about what is going on behind the scenes.
[2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:49.680]  So we are making strides.
[2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:58.680]  And I think that the opposition, which is the Illuminati, which you know more and more nominal terms
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:04:03.680]  as a council in foreign relations, a trilateral commission, the Bilderberger group, et cetera,
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:05.680]  they're on the run.
[2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:09.680]  I mean, you may not think so, but they could have some serious problems.
[2:04:09.680 --> 2:04:13.680]  I mean, everything they've done in the Middle East has gone upside down for them.
[2:04:13.680 --> 2:04:21.680]  And now, they were not able to stop the financial and economic carnage that they began some five years ago.
[2:04:21.680 --> 2:04:24.680]  And so, they're in a real pickle.
[2:04:24.680 --> 2:04:25.680]  Absolutely.
[2:04:25.680 --> 2:04:32.680]  And there are no easy solutions, although I do want to discuss solutions for the regular people out there, for the viewers.
[2:04:32.680 --> 2:04:38.680]  And I also want to discuss the fact that, you know, Mexico's currency isn't that far behind us anymore.
[2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:39.680]  We're really close.
[2:04:39.680 --> 2:04:41.680]  I think it's something like five to one.

[2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:54.600]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:54.600 --> 2:07:58.760]  All right, folks, we are back, it's the Alex Jones show.
[2:07:58.760 --> 2:08:04.000]  I am Jason Bermuth with me is Bob Chapman of theinternationalforecaster.com.
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.640]  I want to remind everybody, truth rising has dropped.
[2:08:06.640 --> 2:08:11.960]  It's over at PrismPlanet.tv in the highest of qualities, almost DVD quality, folks.
[2:08:11.960 --> 2:08:15.080]  It's really just about as close to a DVD as you're going to get.
[2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:16.080]  You can get it.
[2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:17.080]  You can burn it to disc.
[2:08:17.080 --> 2:08:20.280]  And if you've got the DivEx DVD player, you can watch it on your big screen.
[2:08:20.280 --> 2:08:21.800]  It's very exciting times.
[2:08:21.800 --> 2:08:26.360]  You go to PrismPlanet.tv and grab a membership, it's 15 cents a day.
[2:08:26.360 --> 2:08:31.040]  Now before we left, Mr. Chapman, I was discussing how the dollar has just plunged.
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:34.560]  We now have Canadian currency, which is actually above the dollar.
[2:08:34.560 --> 2:08:38.720]  I was actually in the mall a week ago and I had some Canadian change and I was about
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:41.600]  to give it to her and I'm like, oh, they usually don't take Canadian change, I'm like thinking
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:45.080]  to myself, wait a minute, this is actually worth more than my money now.
[2:08:45.080 --> 2:08:49.480]  And of course, the cashier girl was absolutely clueless at that point, but me and Alex were
[2:08:49.480 --> 2:08:53.160]  discussing how close we are to the peso and how scary that is at this point.
[2:08:53.160 --> 2:08:54.480]  Could you go over some of that?
[2:08:54.480 --> 2:09:05.360]  Well, first of all, we have seen the Canadian dollar go to 115 several months ago and it's
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:06.360]  backed off.
[2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:14.160]  It closed here on yesterday, Thursday at 98.20.
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:21.920]  So right now it's worth a little bit less than the dollar, a tenth of a cent less.
[2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:29.800]  And that is in part because, as you know, Canada is a natural resource producer, a big
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:30.800]  one.
[2:09:30.800 --> 2:09:39.600]  That's because it is the Bank of Canada and the Canadian government don't want that currency
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:41.200]  going higher.
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:49.520]  And the reason why is they find it difficult to compete under free trade and world trade
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:56.320]  organization rules, especially for manufacturing in Ontario and Quebec.
[2:09:56.320 --> 2:10:00.840]  And so I don't expect the Canadian dollar to run away against the US dollar because of
[2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:07.920]  the manipulation by their central bank and the policies of the present Canadian government.
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:17.280]  As far as the Mexican peso is concerned, the peso recently hit a high of 1027.
[2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:19.920]  And you're probably wondering how I know all these things.
[2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:22.880]  I watch them like a hawk and have for years and years.
[2:10:22.880 --> 2:10:32.400]  In fact, to my subscribers, I predicted the Mexican peso used to be pegged to the dollar
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:33.920]  one for one.
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:39.320]  And I predicted it would go to 325 to a dollar, and most people thought it was mad, and of
[2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:44.200]  course that happened, and look where it is today.
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:46.880]  But anyway, back to the price of the peso.
[2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:52.480]  It wasn't too long ago, several months ago, that the peso was 11.3 to the dollar, which
[2:10:52.480 --> 2:10:55.480]  means it was much weaker than it is now.
[2:10:55.480 --> 2:11:03.880]  And presently, the peso yesterday morning was 1034, 1037, and I'm sure that in part
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:12.800]  is because the Mexican government stepped in and made it a little cheaper.
[2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:18.000]  The Bank of Mexico race interest rates are too long ago because of inflation, which they
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:21.800]  say is running close to 5%.
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:25.400]  And that's probably so and it's probably even higher than that.
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:33.560]  But the appreciation of the Mexican peso against the dollar over the past, let's say four
[2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:38.160]  months, has been about 10%, highly unusual.
[2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:44.320]  That's because the U.S. problem with their balance of payments deficit is greater than
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:46.440]  that of Mexico.
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:53.080]  Mexico in the last 10 years in particular have really cleaned up their financial act,
[2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:59.120]  so to speak, and they're in much better condition than they were previously historically.
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:08.640]  But Mexico's main problem is not a diminuating tax coming, a revenue coming from diminishing
[2:12:08.640 --> 2:12:09.920]  oil production.
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:16.720]  It's from the wealthy in Mexico who control 85% of the wealth, and they hold most of their
[2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:22.600]  wealth offshore off from the country of Mexico, and they do that so they don't have to pay
[2:12:22.600 --> 2:12:24.480]  taxes on it.
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:30.880]  And unless that money starts to get retrieved so that it can be invested in Mexico, their
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:37.280]  problems are never going to get solved because you need a strong educational process, and
[2:12:37.280 --> 2:12:42.920]  education is not free in Mexico, and it's expensive for poor people.
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:48.920]  It costs $200 a year for a little boy or a little girl to go to the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th,
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:51.200]  10th grade into high school.
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:13:00.480]  And when you've got a daddy who's a policeman who's making $500 a month, that $200 is a
[2:13:00.480 --> 2:13:04.200]  lot of money, and so that has to stop.
[2:13:04.200 --> 2:13:09.520]  It has to be real free education in Mexico, and those jobs have got to be created so the
[2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:15.520]  people who have illegally gone to America will want to go home so that they can be with
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:18.840]  their own people in their own culture and make a decent living.
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:25.560]  Absolutely, but that's what is so worrisome to me is that our country is going to be merging
[2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:30.800]  with Mexico and Canada through the SPP, through NAFTA, through CAFTA.
[2:13:30.800 --> 2:13:34.320]  I don't know exactly when this is going to happen or how long it's going to take, but
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:38.880]  I would hate to see the standard of living be dropped to that of, oh my God, we need
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:43.560]  to pay such and such so our kids get a middle school or a high school education.
[2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:45.320]  It sounds like insanity to me.
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:51.760]  Well, I can guarantee you, Jason, it will happen if we have an amalgamation of those
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:58.560]  three countries, and that is another method of bringing those countries financially and
[2:13:58.560 --> 2:14:02.760]  economically to their knees, particularly the United States and Canada, so that they
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:06.200]  can't argue about the implementation of world government.
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:13.280]  And I think that the North American Union is in a long ways away, and I think the Amaro
[2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:21.120]  is a long ways away, and we're hearing noises out of Mexico right now that they're starting
[2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:29.880]  to realize what it is, especially in the Senate and in the Assembly, and I think it's going
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:32.720]  to be a pretty cold day that that happens.
[2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:36.840]  And so I don't see it, any of that, at least within the next five years.
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:41.480]  But don't you think that the Mexicans, especially their government, their officials, their
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:47.200]  elite are going to be pushing for this, because like you just said, 90% of the country is
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:51.320]  run by about what, 5% or 10% of the people, and this is only going to benefit them even
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:56.800]  further in trade, and they'll sell it to the commoners in Mexico as, look, we're going
[2:14:56.800 --> 2:15:01.960]  to become part of the United States, paved roads everywhere, malls, everything we've
[2:15:01.960 --> 2:15:02.960]  ever dreamed of.
[2:15:02.960 --> 2:15:05.200]  They've already got all that.
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:06.200]  But don't you feel like...
[2:15:06.200 --> 2:15:13.080]  You go to Mexico City and Guadalajara and Monterey, and you go down the street, and
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:19.520]  over there is Walmart, next door is Sam's, and down the street, 100 yards away is Costco,
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:25.840]  and up the way is Liverpool, which is the equivalent of Nordstrom's, and you've already
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:27.600]  got all that there.
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:32.760]  And you've got a toll highways, yes, but you've got highways and the good ones, no.
[2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:38.920]  Another problem in Mexico is the formation of industry and services.
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:41.400]  The brain power is there.
[2:15:41.400 --> 2:15:42.400]  That's what's good.
[2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:47.400]  The investments have to be made financially, and number two, the educational system has
[2:15:47.400 --> 2:15:55.000]  to be made free, and the labor unions are not helping, because in order to compete with
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:57.880]  China and India, they're lowering wages.
[2:15:57.880 --> 2:16:05.400]  I mean, they're bad enough that they are, and so Mexico has great potential.
[2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:10.040]  It's just that the money has to be brought into place to do it.
[2:16:10.040 --> 2:16:18.200]  And I want to tell you this, that the assembly and the Senate in Mexico is going to be very,
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:24.520]  very hard to convince them to join the North American Union, and they're fighting right
[2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:32.840]  now with the administration, which is run by Pan and the two, the assembly and the Senate
[2:16:32.840 --> 2:16:40.920]  is run by PRD, and they've got a battle going on because Calderon, who's the president,
[2:16:40.920 --> 2:16:49.000]  wants to denationalize the oil industry, and he can't even get that accomplished.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:51.200]  So North American Union is a long way away.
[2:16:51.200 --> 2:16:54.560]  Well, now that you've brought up oil, let's get into it.
[2:16:54.560 --> 2:16:59.880]  Higher gas prices than ever everywhere I go, right here in Texas, it's about $4 a gallon
[2:16:59.880 --> 2:17:00.880]  for regular.
[2:17:00.880 --> 2:17:04.760]  I was down in New York, like I said last week, and God, I wasn't even in the city, and it
[2:17:04.760 --> 2:17:07.120]  was like $4.50 for regular.
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:11.200]  Are we going to see a cap on these gas prices, or are we going to be paying like $6 a gallon
[2:17:11.200 --> 2:17:12.200]  by the end of the summer?
[2:17:12.200 --> 2:17:15.160]  Well, let's go to the reasons.
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:19.360]  Number one, there's more demand than supply, and it's as simple as that.
[2:17:19.360 --> 2:17:25.160]  In the United States, yes, they've cut back 2, 3, 4%, depending upon where you look in
[2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:26.160]  gasoline consumption.
[2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:31.640]  That's going to continue, but you've got faces like India and China that are expanding,
[2:17:31.640 --> 2:17:33.840]  and so the demand is there.
[2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:37.280]  So we have more demand than supply, and that's why prices are high.
[2:17:37.280 --> 2:17:44.480]  Yes, we have speculation, anywhere between 20 and 35% of the market in all commodities
[2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:47.560]  is speculation, and that's good.
[2:17:47.560 --> 2:17:53.000]  Because if there's somebody out there who's willing, at some price, to take delivery,
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:58.080]  or at least say that they're going to take delivery, of 100,000 barrels of oil, or a
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:02.000]  million bushels of corn, or whatever it is.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:09.320]  What's making the prices go up is two things, but one in particular, and that is, the Fed
[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:16.480]  reserve supplying the money to the financial system so that they can go and create excessive
[2:18:16.480 --> 2:18:21.760]  speculation in the commodity markets, because they are no longer making money, which they
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:27.720]  were making two-thirds of their income, from packaging mortgages into bonds that weren't
[2:18:27.720 --> 2:18:31.000]  worth the paper they were written on.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:39.440]  And so the speculation that's happening among banks, investment banks, brokerage houses,
[2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:45.960]  in the energy sector is what has driven prices to the levels that they're at.
[2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:48.240]  Where should oil be selling for?
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:54.560]  I think a fair price today, considering demand, would be about $80 a barrel.
[2:18:54.560 --> 2:18:57.080]  It's around $140.
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:19:01.920]  It shouldn't be there, and it's probably going to go higher over the short term.
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:11.480]  Natural gas, $13.5, actually $13.60, a BCF, it'll probably move up to $14.50, it could
[2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:20.360]  catabilt dependent $20, oil could go to $1.70, gasoline could go up another $0.50 a gallon.
[2:19:20.360 --> 2:19:25.240]  And so it's not going to go away, but those are the reasons why, as far as the high prices
[2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:32.120]  for food, the real culprit is ethanol, taking down about one-third of the carbon that we're
[2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:37.400]  producing, and that would you rather have, cheap gasoline or no food.
[2:19:37.400 --> 2:19:39.320]  All right, let's get into ethanol on the other side.
[2:19:39.320 --> 2:19:48.240]  The Alex Jones Show, PrismPlanet.tv, the 9-Eleven Chronicles, Truth Rising.
[2:19:48.240 --> 2:19:53.960]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra,
[2:19:53.960 --> 2:19:57.360]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[2:19:57.360 --> 2:20:02.640]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-Eleven film that finally gives first responders a platform
[2:20:02.640 --> 2:20:04.320]  to tell their story.
[2:20:04.320 --> 2:20:13.240]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:20:13.240 --> 2:20:18.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-Eleven Truth, as brave souls throughout the world
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:20.280]  take action against their global masters.
[2:20:20.280 --> 2:20:23.440]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:20:23.440 --> 2:20:29.240]  He takes his hand off, and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:36.160]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide, download Truth Rising at prismplanet.tv and
[2:20:36.160 --> 2:20:41.280]  aggressively spread it worldwide, or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:20:41.280 --> 2:20:44.960]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[2:20:44.960 --> 2:20:46.800]  and bring in martial law.
[2:20:46.800 --> 2:20:47.800]  Gold.
[2:20:47.800 --> 2:20:49.920]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:54.400]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the industrial age to the space age, gold
[2:20:54.400 --> 2:20:56.160]  has weathered the test of time.
[2:20:56.160 --> 2:21:00.540]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[2:21:00.540 --> 2:21:04.680]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:09.120]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to
[2:21:09.120 --> 2:21:13.000]  a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[2:22:46.680 --> 2:22:52.680]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[2:22:52.680 --> 2:22:57.680]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[2:22:57.680 --> 2:23:02.680]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.

[2:23:06.680 --> 2:23:14.680]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[2:23:14.680 --> 2:23:20.680]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[2:23:20.680 --> 2:23:26.680]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[2:23:26.680 --> 2:23:31.680]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[2:24:06.680 --> 2:24:14.680]  We give it to you on DivX. Hopefully he's going to encode all of his movies in DivX, give them out for the kids in the highest of qualities for those of us.
[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:19.680]  If you resend, you can get a high-quality DVD. Those will be shipping out, I believe, starting Monday.
[2:24:19.680 --> 2:24:27.680]  All you people out there gearing up for big barbecues and big firework displays, remember, there's no day like the present to spread the truth.
[2:24:27.680 --> 2:24:35.680]  And that's why we like you to share this radio show, get the podcast, get our films, burnin' the disc, hand them out, hold screenings, all that good stuff.
[2:24:35.680 --> 2:24:41.680]  We're going to be talking about a lot more of that with Luke Radowski in the final hour and what's going on in New York City.
[2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:49.680]  On the September 11th anniversary this year, but right now we're with a Bob Chapman, and you were getting into ethanol at the end.
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:57.680]  And, you know, Alex thinks that the ethanol thing is a total and complete scam. It's phony environmentalism, and it's harmful, isn't it, Bob?
[2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:04.680]  It is, and Alex is absolutely right, like he is about almost everything.
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:11.680]  And we're glad we have Alex on the air, and he's young, and he's vibrant, and I'm old, and I can't do it anymore.
[2:25:11.680 --> 2:25:16.680]  But anyway, it is a scam.
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:29.680]  And 85% of ethanol is created by Archie Daniels Midland, and Archie Daniels Midland is a top group,
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:38.680]  are the owners of the company, are Bilderbergers and CFR and Trilateralists, et cetera.
[2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:48.680]  And of course you get your hangarons, ex-politicians like Tom Dashel and Bob Dole.
[2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:56.680]  Dashel's from South Dakota and Dole's from Kansas, and they produce great amounts of corn, so they're all for that.
[2:25:56.680 --> 2:26:07.680]  And then you have Barack Obama, who got caught getting cheap flights at subsidized rates and corporate jets, owned by ADM,
[2:26:07.680 --> 2:26:20.680]  which is the symbol for Archie Daniels Midland, back in 2004, and his Obama's advisor on energy and environmental issues,
[2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:28.680]  is Jason Brumet, who was on the National Commission of the Energy Policy associated with ethanol.
[2:26:28.680 --> 2:26:36.680]  So if Mr. Obama is elected, then ethanol is not going to be curtailed.
[2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:41.680]  And the same thing with Mr. McCain, he has all those ghosts in his closet as well.
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:49.680]  And so we're not going to get any relief if these people are elected presidents.
[2:26:49.680 --> 2:26:58.680]  And about one-third of the corn in the country goes for that in production, created into ethanol.
[2:26:58.680 --> 2:27:06.680]  And of course it does injure the engine, particularly the gaskets, which hold the engine together.
[2:27:06.680 --> 2:27:10.680]  And in time you have to have more repairs.
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:16.680]  And of course there's a subsidy that goes with ethanol, which is ridiculous.
[2:27:16.680 --> 2:27:19.680]  And it's a whole thing as a scam.
[2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:27.680]  And it's creating higher food prices because corn is being farmed, which is going into ethanol.
[2:27:27.680 --> 2:27:28.680]  It wouldn't be otherwise.
[2:27:28.680 --> 2:27:36.680]  And then the farmers are not growing wheat or soybeans or something else that would have gone into the system because they're growing corn.
[2:27:36.680 --> 2:27:49.680]  And so the United States and Europe in particular agreed, all the experts agreed at the meeting in Lima, Peru about a month ago,
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:55.680]  that ethanol should stop production, but they didn't pass any initiatives on it.
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:57.680]  They wouldn't do anything about it.
[2:27:57.680 --> 2:28:06.680]  And the reason why is that the alumnus don't want that to happen because Archie Daniels Midland is making lots of money,
[2:28:06.680 --> 2:28:12.680]  and people in the third world are dying, and they're useless eaters, and the alumnus want to get rid of them.
[2:28:12.680 --> 2:28:13.680]  Absolutely.
[2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:17.680]  I mean, it really is about population control and the consolidation of power.
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:21.680]  Meanwhile, they sell the public on this green movement, you know, saying,
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:29.680]  you know, we need to grow, go green, we need to go green, they have commercials now where Al Sharpton and Pat Robertson are sitting on a couch together,
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:32.680]  you know, patting each other on the back, promoting global warming.
[2:28:32.680 --> 2:28:39.680]  And the next step is to promote a carbon tax and, you know, start taxing the evil humans based on how much they actually use in gas,
[2:28:39.680 --> 2:28:41.680]  how many cars they own, how much trash they have.
[2:28:41.680 --> 2:28:50.680]  And it's absolute insanity, yet it is now a buzz term that I hear from a lot of people that think they're doing good in the world.
[2:28:50.680 --> 2:28:52.680]  It boggles my mind.
[2:28:52.680 --> 2:28:54.680]  Well, they don't get it.
[2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:58.680]  They don't understand the psycho-political aspect of what's going on.
[2:28:58.680 --> 2:29:01.680]  It takes a long time.
[2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:08.680]  It takes a lot of research to really get it to get into the alumnus heads to find out what they're doing,
[2:29:08.680 --> 2:29:11.680]  how they're doing it, and where they're headed.
[2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:20.680]  You have to start out off by re-ratcheting your mind and thinking like a full-term, all-out criminal.
[2:29:20.680 --> 2:29:27.680]  Well, that's what they are, they're absolute maniacal criminals, and they get their just desserts in 9-11 Chronicles.
[2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:37.680]  Truth Rising watches the global elite and their minions are confronted by the power of free speech right now at prisonplanet.tv.

[2:32:47.680 --> 2:33:05.680]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away. The lanes and the meadows.
[2:33:05.680 --> 2:33:10.680]  The places where you used to play.
[2:33:10.680 --> 2:33:19.680]  It wasn't inside junk. By the world connected. Your middle protest.
[2:33:19.680 --> 2:33:22.680]  Some merrily reached its way.
[2:33:22.680 --> 2:33:27.680]  It wasn't inside junk. Like it always is.
[2:33:27.680 --> 2:33:30.680]  That's right, folks.
[2:33:30.680 --> 2:33:37.680]  Despite what the BBC is going to tell you in a couple days, 9-Eleven was an inside job.
[2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:41.680]  They're going to put out some junk science.
[2:33:41.680 --> 2:33:47.680]  Some nonsensical propaganda piece on how building 7 fell from fire and damage.
[2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:53.680]  And the news just happened to have the foresight to report that same very fact before the building had even collapsed.
[2:33:53.680 --> 2:33:58.680]  Yet it took almost seven years for a report on the matter.
[2:33:58.680 --> 2:34:02.680]  It's absolutely ludicrous. The BBC, you continue to sicken me.
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:08.680]  But before we go back to Bob Chapman, I just sent this link by Aaron Dykes.
[2:34:08.680 --> 2:34:18.680]  It is a speech by Cassinage on July 4th telling how patriotic it is actually to impeach the president.
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:24.680]  We talked about Dennis in the first segment, one of the real patriots of the year outside of Ron Paul.
[2:34:24.680 --> 2:34:27.680]  Dennis Cassinage has done so much for this movement.
[2:34:27.680 --> 2:34:35.680]  You know, those 35 articles on the House floor, the last three of which, including 9-Eleven, is just an amazing step.
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:39.680]  So without further ado, let's play this little clip.
[2:34:39.680 --> 2:34:42.680]  Democratic leaders say impeachments off the table.
[2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:48.680]  So let's set a new table for a nation upon which we place the Constitution
[2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:53.680]  and where we demand that all those who have taken a oath to defend it keep their promise
[2:34:53.680 --> 2:34:56.680]  and protect our nation from the threat within.
[2:34:56.680 --> 2:35:01.680]  Please go to Cassinage.us now and sign the petition which calls for impeachment.
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:07.680]  This is the one petition that will make a difference because I will be personally delivering it to your member of Congress.
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:12.680]  Please circulate word of this petition far and wide to all your friends and family.
[2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:18.680]  This is the one opportunity we have right now to actually change events in this country.
[2:35:18.680 --> 2:35:24.680]  232 years ago, our nation was conceived in liberty.
[2:35:24.680 --> 2:35:30.680]  We have once again reached a moment of truth, one that Lincoln recognized at Gettysburg,
[2:35:30.680 --> 2:35:39.680]  as to whether this nation or any nation so conceived or so dedicated can long endure.
[2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:48.680]  Through the ashes of the Civil War, Lincoln prayed that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:56.680]  and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.
[2:35:56.680 --> 2:36:07.680]  This 4th of July, 2008, we face a different kind of war, one which is trying our souls, a war based on lies.
[2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:15.680]  With the power of truth, the power of the people, we can achieve a new birth of freedom
[2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:26.680]  standing up for what is good in America, insisting on the rule of law, demanding adherence to the Constitution,
[2:36:26.680 --> 2:36:34.680]  and supporting the impeachment of a President who lied to take us into a war against Iraq.
[2:36:34.680 --> 2:36:37.680]  Be the answer to Lincoln's prayer.
[2:36:37.680 --> 2:36:43.680]  Please pledge your support now to restore him the rule of law in America.
[2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:47.680]  Let us once again celebrate Independence Day.
[2:36:47.680 --> 2:36:59.680]  Let us celebrate freedom from fear and pledge that this government of the people will survive in this land that we love.
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:03.680]  Please go to Cassinage.us now.
[2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:07.680]  This is your opportunity to make a difference.
[2:37:07.680 --> 2:37:11.680]  Truly celebrate Independence Day.
[2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:15.680]  Thank you and happy 4th of July.
[2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:23.680]  Go to Cassinage.us with K-U-C-I-N-I-C-H.U-S and I want you to sign that petition.
[2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:27.680]  I want these articles of impeachment to move forward.
[2:37:27.680 --> 2:37:29.680]  This is the guy giving us the opportunity.
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:31.680]  What did you just think about that speech, Bob?
[2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:33.680]  I thought it was terrific.
[2:37:33.680 --> 2:37:39.680]  What's good about all this because of the evil that's been committed
[2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:47.680]  is that we have people like Ron Paul and Dennis who come from very different parts of the political spectrum
[2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:55.680]  coming together with many similar ideas and how to extricate America from this terrible morass that it's in.
[2:37:55.680 --> 2:38:01.680]  And bringing the left and the right together, so to speak, is a wonderful accomplishment
[2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:09.680]  because that makes us all really one people who are not at odds with one another.
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:13.680]  We're always going to have disagreements and that's okay.
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:23.680]  But this participation of conservatives and liberals and people from all walks of political life
[2:38:23.680 --> 2:38:35.680]  in endeavors now to go forward and cleanse our country of people like the President of the United States legally is a wonderful action.
[2:38:35.680 --> 2:38:39.680]  It really is and Dennis is leading the way and I like how he started off saying,
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:45.680]  if it's off the table for Democratic leaders, then let's put it on the table for a new party.
[2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:53.680]  I mean, Nancy Pelosi and APAC went into his office and tried to extort essentially threw them out before these articles were released.
[2:38:53.680 --> 2:38:55.680]  He's now looking for the support of the people.
[2:38:55.680 --> 2:38:57.680]  We need to give him that support.
[2:38:57.680 --> 2:39:06.680]  We need to make it known that this is what we want, that this is really a last ditch effort to bring these tyrants to some sort of justice,
[2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:13.680]  for some sort of transparency so that more can be revealed on how criminal this organization has truly been.
[2:39:13.680 --> 2:39:15.680]  That's what this administration is.
[2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:17.680]  It is a criminal organization.
[2:39:17.680 --> 2:39:19.680]  Bush does not run the show.
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:27.680]  I think the fact that Kucinich had already tried to impeach Cheney and that was shot down, he's really the only one gunning.
[2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:31.680]  When he's gunning for the real guys, he knows that now Bush is the big name.
[2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:33.680]  He goes after Bush in the entire administration.
[2:39:33.680 --> 2:39:41.680]  Maybe he does get some answers and really he left very few stones unturned with 35 articles.
[2:39:41.680 --> 2:39:43.680]  That's right.
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:49.680]  I think we can all help ourselves by clearing conquerors.
[2:39:49.680 --> 2:39:52.680]  Vote them all out of office except Dennis and Ron.
[2:39:52.680 --> 2:39:54.680]  Just get rid of them.
[2:39:54.680 --> 2:40:02.680]  At least it will give us a year of breathing room before those who are compromised get compromised
[2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:08.680]  and those who are willing to get on the payroll of the alumnus get on there.
[2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:11.680]  We have a window of opportunity here.
[2:40:11.680 --> 2:40:13.680]  Don't let it slip through our hands.
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:20.680]  Fortunately, there's some 45 or 50 congressmen and senators who are not running for reelection.
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:28.680]  That gives us at least a partial piece of help in getting these people out.
[2:40:28.680 --> 2:40:33.680]  It's people we don't have to continue with which were there before.
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:38.680]  Nancy Pelosi is a person that we really don't want there anymore.
[2:40:38.680 --> 2:40:45.680]  While of you people in her district, please give that some thought.
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:46.680]  Absolutely.
[2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:52.680]  One of the things that people don't understand is that Pelosi was part of the initial congressional investigation into 9-11.
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:54.680]  She was the lead Democrat.
[2:40:54.680 --> 2:40:58.680]  That whole investigation was a total cover-up.
[2:40:58.680 --> 2:41:01.680]  They actually redacted 27 pages in that report.
[2:41:01.680 --> 2:41:03.680]  It still hasn't been released.
[2:41:03.680 --> 2:41:05.680]  It was a whitewash anyway.
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:10.680]  I'm sure those 27 pages probably have to do with foreign government funding of the hijackers
[2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:14.680]  and possibly help on the inside from those foreign governments.
[2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:18.680]  That won't come to light according to Bob Graham for another 15 or 20 years.
[2:41:18.680 --> 2:41:21.680]  He said 20 to 30 years in 2002.
[2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:23.680]  She was in on the cover-up from the beginning.
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:25.680]  She's not our friend.
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:31.680]  We should not celebrate that a lot of people invested in the 2006 elections thinking,
[2:41:31.680 --> 2:41:33.680]  oh, the Democrats are in, the world is saved.
[2:41:33.680 --> 2:41:35.680]  That's just not the case.
[2:41:35.680 --> 2:41:40.680]  When are people going to grow up and realize that this is a false left-right paradigm
[2:41:40.680 --> 2:41:45.680]  and that the only change is going to come from within, from them, from non-party-affiliated people?
[2:41:45.680 --> 2:41:48.680]  Is that going to happen?
[2:41:48.680 --> 2:41:50.680]  Well, it's going to happen.
[2:41:50.680 --> 2:41:55.680]  I agree it's got to happen, but when does it happen, Bob?
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:41:57.680]  That's why we put movies out like 9-Eleven Truth Rising.
[2:41:57.680 --> 2:41:59.680]  That's why we're on the radio almost every day.
[2:41:59.680 --> 2:42:01.680]  That's why we're writing.
[2:42:01.680 --> 2:42:06.680]  Thank gosh for the internet.
[2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:10.680]  We just got to keep on doing it until we can't do it anymore.
[2:42:10.680 --> 2:42:11.680]  Absolutely.
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:14.680]  I had a question from one of the callers earlier today.
[2:42:14.680 --> 2:42:21.680]  They were asking me to ask you about these $600 refund checks that everybody is getting shortly
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:23.680]  from the federal government.
[2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:29.680]  Now, he said that he didn't believe that the federal government had any right to hand out these checks
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:31.680]  unless they were in gold or silver.
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:35.680]  Is that true?
[2:42:35.680 --> 2:42:37.680]  I don't know.
[2:42:37.680 --> 2:42:43.680]  Well, he was talking about that and he may be right, but I can't answer that because I don't know.
[2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:46.680]  I didn't know either and I thought that you might be the guy to ask.
[2:42:46.680 --> 2:42:52.680]  He was basically saying that the federal government doesn't have jurisdiction to put this out unless it was in gold or silver
[2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:55.680]  and he was wondering if he could put out a class action lawsuit.
[2:42:55.680 --> 2:43:00.680]  I guess if you're still listening, go to Google, go to another source because we just don't know.
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:04.680]  That's another thing, this $600 that everybody is going to get back.
[2:43:04.680 --> 2:43:10.680]  The majority of the people out there, unfortunately, that aren't expecting this,
[2:43:10.680 --> 2:43:12.680]  this is going to be a little treat for them.
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:19.680]  It's going to be a new PlayStation 3 or a new Wii or maybe a car payment.
[2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:22.680]  It's really going to be frivolous stuff and it's not.
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:26.680]  You don't believe the $600 is going to stimulate the economy, do you, Bob?
[2:43:26.680 --> 2:43:30.680]  No, and I think it's more psychological than anything else.
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:37.680]  When we see the final figures, I think you'll find two thirds of it went towards paying back payments and something
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:40.680]  and probably mostly credit cards.
[2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:45.680]  All of the checks haven't been released, a part of them have and part of them have got to go.
[2:43:45.680 --> 2:43:52.680]  Congress is talking about doing it again and maybe they will.
[2:43:52.680 --> 2:44:00.680]  They're talking about extending unemployment and in this kind of environment, I quite frankly think that's a good idea.
[2:44:00.680 --> 2:44:12.680]  I'm not for socialistic measures, but when people see the lies that we have received in regard to unemployment figures,
[2:44:12.680 --> 2:44:15.680]  a true unemployment is 14%.
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:18.680]  That includes all the long term is in everything else.
[2:44:18.680 --> 2:44:27.680]  If you take and leave the long term is out, it's 9.7% and those are the discouraged and people like that.
[2:44:27.680 --> 2:44:35.680]  And if you drop down to what the figures they give to the American public of 5.5%, those are only the current people.
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:42.680]  And besides, we've lost millions and millions of jobs over the last several years to free trade globalization,
[2:44:42.680 --> 2:44:47.680]  offshoring and outsourcing, and it's driven wages down as well.
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:52.680]  And then you have the illegal alien factor which has helped drive those wages down as well.
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:44:59.680]  So the American public is in tough shape and it's going to get tougher because unemployment is going to climb.
[2:44:59.680 --> 2:45:06.680]  And the figures that we saw come out yesterday, even though they're bogus figures,
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:14.680]  even they showed that we are in a recession and it's not going to get better, it's going to get worse.
[2:45:14.680 --> 2:45:16.680]  Well, I mean, that's all over the place.
[2:45:16.680 --> 2:45:21.680]  I mean, I'm constantly watching CNBC and it's just kind of out in the open.
[2:45:21.680 --> 2:45:25.680]  Even though we're in a recession, the only people that are telling us that we're not, we're going to be okay,
[2:45:25.680 --> 2:45:27.680]  are really this administration.
[2:45:27.680 --> 2:45:29.680]  Well, maybe Fox News too.
[2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:35.680]  But it's such a thinly veiled lie when we really don't produce anything in this country anymore.
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:39.680]  I mean, what do we make in this country now, Bob?
[2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:42.680]  Well, we make a few cars and trucks and there are things we make.
[2:45:42.680 --> 2:45:51.680]  And we're down from about 25% to 25 years ago of manufacturing the things that we use and need.
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:45:54.680]  We're down to about 11%.
[2:45:54.680 --> 2:45:59.680]  And that's why if the dollar were to fall on the USDX, which is a dollar index,
[2:45:59.680 --> 2:46:08.680]  it's around 72 right now and it's down from 130 several years ago.
[2:46:08.680 --> 2:46:12.680]  If it drops down to, say, 50 or 55, which I think it will,
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:18.680]  then people think that our exports will pick up and our GDP will increase
[2:46:18.680 --> 2:46:22.680]  and a balance of payments will be, a deficit will be reduced.
[2:46:22.680 --> 2:46:24.680]  And that's not going to be the case.
[2:46:24.680 --> 2:46:27.680]  It'll add about one half of 1% to GDP.
[2:46:27.680 --> 2:46:31.680]  And that's it because, as you say, we don't make very much anymore.
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:34.680]  No, it seems like everything is outsourced.
[2:46:34.680 --> 2:46:38.680]  I see a lot of kids getting out of college and they're still flipping burgers
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:40.680]  or working in restaurants and living with their parents
[2:46:40.680 --> 2:46:43.680]  and they don't know why they can't find a job in their field.
[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:45.680]  And I'm like, well, number one, the economy is bad.
[2:46:45.680 --> 2:46:47.680]  Number two, we don't really produce anything.
[2:46:47.680 --> 2:46:51.680]  And number three, it seems like the biggest thing is the technology market
[2:46:51.680 --> 2:46:53.680]  and that's the easiest to outsource.
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:46:55.680]  I mean, how many times have you called about computer repair
[2:46:55.680 --> 2:46:58.680]  and you get somebody on the line who's from Pakistan or India?
[2:46:58.680 --> 2:47:02.680]  So I really wonder where this country is headed
[2:47:02.680 --> 2:47:05.680]  in terms of gross national product.
[2:47:05.680 --> 2:47:06.680]  What are we going to make?
[2:47:06.680 --> 2:47:11.680]  What are we going to produce that the rest of the world absolutely needs other than ideas?
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:13.680]  I mean, what are we going to do?
[2:47:13.680 --> 2:47:17.680]  Within five years, IBM will be a foreign corporation.
[2:47:17.680 --> 2:47:20.680]  And they've told us that.
[2:47:20.680 --> 2:47:21.680]  And that's very scary.
[2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:23.680]  They're a national conglomerate.
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:28.680]  And as a result of that, I know people who have two degrees
[2:47:28.680 --> 2:47:34.680]  and three degrees that are making 32 and 35 and $40,000 a year
[2:47:34.680 --> 2:47:40.680]  because someone in another place is willing to do their job for $12,000 a year.
[2:47:40.680 --> 2:47:42.680]  And so what is the solution?
[2:47:42.680 --> 2:47:44.680]  Very simple.
[2:47:44.680 --> 2:47:48.680]  The end of free trade globalization, offshoring and outsourcing.
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:52.680]  We need tariffs on goods and services.
[2:47:52.680 --> 2:47:58.680]  We have to go back to what we were doing before that made America great.
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:01.680]  And that's all the other countries will do the same thing.
[2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:02.680]  And that's okay.
[2:48:02.680 --> 2:48:04.680]  It's going to cause inflation in the United States.
[2:48:04.680 --> 2:48:06.680]  That's okay.
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:11.680]  It'll be a pittance compared to the inflation that is created every single day
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:14.680]  by the privately owned Federal Reserve,
[2:48:14.680 --> 2:48:21.680]  which is pouring money and credit into our economy at a rate of 18% annually.
[2:48:21.680 --> 2:48:24.680]  That's a devaluation of your currency.
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:29.680]  And our inflation, real inflation, will be over 15% by the end of the year.
[2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:32.680]  It's almost 13% now.
[2:48:32.680 --> 2:48:36.680]  And you can take all the other figures from government and most governments
[2:48:36.680 --> 2:48:39.680]  and throw them out the window because they're all lies.
[2:48:39.680 --> 2:48:43.680]  You know, that's another great thing that Ron Paul was able to provide us with.
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:47.680]  It was an awakening to the fact that the Federal Reserve is anything but federal
[2:48:47.680 --> 2:48:49.680]  and that it doesn't have our best interest at heart.
[2:48:49.680 --> 2:48:52.680]  In fact, it doesn't have American interest at heart at all.
[2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:58.680]  It has the interest of producing more capital and more power for them for the elite at heart.
[2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:01.680]  And now people seem to be waking up to that.
[2:49:01.680 --> 2:49:03.680]  I mean, my friends know about the Federal Reserve.
[2:49:03.680 --> 2:49:05.680]  A lot of them are getting into gold and silver.
[2:49:05.680 --> 2:49:09.680]  They realize that this system is not very well regulated,
[2:49:09.680 --> 2:49:13.680]  that they just print the money out of thin air and it's not backed by anything.
[2:49:13.680 --> 2:49:17.680]  Do you see the Federal Reserve in any way collapsing within the next five to 10 years
[2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:20.680]  and maybe they create some other type of an organization?
[2:49:20.680 --> 2:49:26.680]  Or do you think that they'll continue with the Fed until it's got just a total global monopoly?
[2:49:26.680 --> 2:49:28.680]  In five years, the system will have come down.
[2:49:28.680 --> 2:49:35.680]  The Fed will be no more and the US Treasury will go back to fulfilling that duty.
[2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:38.680]  And that's what we need in America along with tariffs.
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:40.680]  We have to have a level playing field.
[2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:46.680]  It's not fair that our industries should move to another country
[2:49:46.680 --> 2:49:51.680]  and still expect to sell in our own country while putting people out of work.
[2:49:51.680 --> 2:49:54.680]  I mean, it's just absolute insanity.
[2:49:54.680 --> 2:49:56.680]  And in who makes out?
[2:49:56.680 --> 2:50:02.680]  Well, the countries that didn't have this advantage before are making out fine.
[2:50:02.680 --> 2:50:05.680]  We'll take China and India as examples, even Mexico.
[2:50:05.680 --> 2:50:10.680]  And the transnational corporations are making all the money.
[2:50:10.680 --> 2:50:12.680]  And this is really where it's at.
[2:50:12.680 --> 2:50:19.680]  They're making 75% of the profit, at least, on this outsourcing and so on and so forth.
[2:50:19.680 --> 2:50:22.680]  And you can't have...
[2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:28.680]  You won't have anybody going and getting degrees in America if we continue to do what we're doing.
[2:50:28.680 --> 2:50:32.680]  People with two and three degrees making 35 grand a year, that's absurd.
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:35.680]  It's absolutely insane, especially with the low price of the dollar.
[2:50:35.680 --> 2:50:39.680]  I mean, it's unreal, but it's where we are today in America.
[2:50:39.680 --> 2:50:40.680]  We'll be back after this.
[2:50:40.680 --> 2:50:43.680]  This is Alex Jones' show, It's Independence Day.
[2:51:14.680 --> 2:51:19.680]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:51:19.680 --> 2:51:24.680]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:51:24.680 --> 2:51:30.680]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:51:30.680 --> 2:51:33.680]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:51:33.680 --> 2:51:38.680]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...
[2:51:38.680 --> 2:51:40.680]  Truth Rising.
[2:51:40.680 --> 2:51:44.680]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:48.680]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:51:48.680 --> 2:51:54.680]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[2:51:54.680 --> 2:52:00.680]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports of suffering from internal parasites.
[2:52:00.680 --> 2:52:06.680]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has been used all over the world

[2:54:10.680 --> 2:54:16.680]  Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade.
[2:54:16.680 --> 2:54:28.680]  The master tongue me in the spring of 25, but I am still alive.
[2:54:28.680 --> 2:54:35.680]  I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide.
[2:54:35.680 --> 2:54:40.680]  With the sea I did abide.
[2:54:40.680 --> 2:54:46.680]  I sailed a school around the Horn of Mexico.
[2:54:46.680 --> 2:54:49.680]  I went along with the girl that made me so lovely.
[2:54:49.680 --> 2:54:52.680]  I could listen to this all day. Love the highwaymen.
[2:54:52.680 --> 2:54:57.680]  When the yards broke off, they said that I got killed.
[2:54:57.680 --> 2:55:01.680]  Folks, this is the time. This is the time to step it up.
[2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:04.680]  This is the time to take the government back.
[2:55:04.680 --> 2:55:10.680]  We got somebody who ran for the presidency on the Republican ticket, who brought truth to power,
[2:55:10.680 --> 2:55:16.680]  that brought truth to the people that has a number one bestselling book with the word manifesto in it.
[2:55:16.680 --> 2:55:23.680]  We have more and more people waking up to 9-11 than ever despite the mainstream media trying to put out its propaganda
[2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:27.680]  and its mainstream hit pieces like the one by the BBC coming up.
[2:55:27.680 --> 2:55:30.680]  And we have a new tool in the info war today.
[2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:34.680]  We have 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, that you can get over at PrismPlanet.tv.
[2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:40.680]  Write this very second in the highest of qualities for around 15 cents a day.
[2:55:40.680 --> 2:55:45.680]  So we hope that you come and you join us in this epic struggle against tyranny.
[2:55:45.680 --> 2:55:49.680]  And we're going to have Luke Radowski on in the next hour to talk about we are change actions
[2:55:49.680 --> 2:55:53.680]  and what's going on in New York City this year on the anniversary of 9-11.
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:59.680]  But right now we're wrapping it up with Bob Chapman of theinternationalforecaster.com.
[2:55:59.680 --> 2:56:07.680]  And it seems like we have a pretty grim future of the world when somebody is just passing by listening to this radio.
[2:56:07.680 --> 2:56:15.680]  But I'm an optimist. I believe if we can wake enough people up, there's no need for a huge depression in this country.
[2:56:15.680 --> 2:56:18.680]  There's no need for a North American union.
[2:56:18.680 --> 2:56:24.680]  There's no reason that we can't have a constitutional government repeal things like homeland security,
[2:56:24.680 --> 2:56:27.680]  get rid of free speech zones in this country.
[2:56:27.680 --> 2:56:31.680]  I think we can win, Bob. How do you feel about it?
[2:56:31.680 --> 2:56:34.680]  Well, I think so. But it's going to be painful.
[2:56:34.680 --> 2:56:43.680]  There's lots of things that have to be done to undo all the excesses that have been done by the governments and those behind government in the past.
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:50.680]  And we've got to start out by clearing Congress and working at the local levels in your county, city, states, towns.
[2:56:50.680 --> 2:56:59.680]  Get rid of the people who want to spend your money wantonly no matter how good the thing might sound that they want to spend it on.
[2:56:59.680 --> 2:57:06.680]  Because we're in a time where the world economy, and especially the American economy, is slowing down dramatically.
[2:57:06.680 --> 2:57:08.680]  Unemployment's going higher.
[2:57:08.680 --> 2:57:11.680]  Inflation is already into hyperinflation.
[2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:14.680]  We need a statesman to lead us.
[2:57:14.680 --> 2:57:20.680]  He either doesn't have the opportunity to be there or isn't there.
[2:57:20.680 --> 2:57:30.680]  And so we've got to work through Congress because the two people that we have that look like they're going to be the nominees certainly don't fill the bill.
[2:57:30.680 --> 2:57:33.680]  And so it's going to be a struggle.
[2:57:33.680 --> 2:57:36.680]  You've got to get yourself out of debt.
[2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:39.680]  You've got to get it into golden, silver-related assets.
[2:57:39.680 --> 2:57:44.680]  You have to have your insurance policy, which is food at home, and ways to defend your family.
[2:57:44.680 --> 2:57:48.680]  And these are the things that are very important for you to do now.
[2:57:48.680 --> 2:57:49.680]  Absolutely.
[2:57:49.680 --> 2:57:53.680]  And to me, again, it's all about spreading this to your friends, your family.
[2:57:53.680 --> 2:57:57.680]  Today, while you're flipping burgers, maybe it's time to talk about the economy.
[2:57:57.680 --> 2:58:01.680]  Maybe it's time to say, hey, it's time to step up.
[2:58:01.680 --> 2:58:03.680]  You want to make change?
[2:58:03.680 --> 2:58:06.680]  Like you said, a lot of the congressional seats are vacated.
[2:58:06.680 --> 2:58:09.680]  I want to thank you, Bob Chapman, for spending an hour with us.
[2:58:09.680 --> 2:58:11.680]  It's theinternationalforecaster.com.
[2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:16.680]  If you want to go check out 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising, you can do so over at prisonplanet.tv.

[2:58:18.680 --> 2:58:19.680]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:45.680]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[2:58:45.680 --> 2:58:49.680]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:58:49.680 --> 2:58:54.680]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:58:54.680 --> 2:58:58.680]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:58:58.680 --> 2:59:03.680]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:06.680]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[2:59:35.680 --> 2:59:47.680]  Prisonplanet.tv Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[2:59:47.680 --> 3:00:05.680]  It's Independence Day, July 4th, 2008. It's the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:09.680]  The one place you're going to find the truth in this crazy mixed up world we live in.
[3:00:09.680 --> 3:00:13.680]  No spin, just the real deal. What's really happening.
[3:00:13.680 --> 3:00:19.680]  The real economics. The men behind the throne.
[3:00:19.680 --> 3:00:25.680]  Those that cower behind the curtain with their gold and rubies and greed.
[3:00:25.680 --> 3:00:30.680]  The ones that call us sheep, cattle, chattel.
[3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:33.680]  Useless feeders.
[3:00:33.680 --> 3:00:35.680]  They're the ones I'm after.
[3:00:35.680 --> 3:00:39.680]  The ones that carried out 9-11. The ones that continue to cover it up.
[3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:42.680]  We will bring them to justice, I promise you.
[3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:45.680]  People will go down.
[3:00:45.680 --> 3:00:47.680]  Thank God for Dennis Kasinich.
[3:00:47.680 --> 3:00:55.680]  Kasinich.us right now. Go there. Kasinich.us right now. Go there. Kasinich.us right now. Go there. Sign the petition.
[3:00:55.680 --> 3:00:58.680]  Make sure that these articles of impeachment are followed up on.
[3:00:58.680 --> 3:01:06.680]  Make sure we send a strong, super strong message that we're not going to take it.
[3:01:06.680 --> 3:01:11.680]  Alright, we're still trying to get Luke on the line, but while we do that, let's take your calls.
[3:01:11.680 --> 3:01:14.680]  We got a bunch of calls, as always, but they've been waiting for a long time.
[3:01:14.680 --> 3:01:19.680]  Fred and Philly, thank you for waiting so long, sir.
[3:01:19.680 --> 3:01:23.680]  Fred, are you there? Hello?
[3:01:23.680 --> 3:01:24.680]  I'm right here.
[3:01:24.680 --> 3:01:25.680]  Alright, man. What's up?
[3:01:25.680 --> 3:01:27.680]  Alright, I had to really wait.
[3:01:27.680 --> 3:01:35.680]  I think you've got to remember that NIST is an agency that does a lot of classified work.
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:47.680]  There's a whole section of NIST that is in that category, in that classification of a secret agency.
[3:01:47.680 --> 3:01:53.680]  And they also, they're very manipulatable because of that fact.
[3:01:53.680 --> 3:02:02.680]  They're not independent, as you can tell if you look into the way some of these agencies are.
[3:02:02.680 --> 3:02:23.680]  They're not independent, so the other thing I just want to mention is I want to differ on and just discuss with you the fact that we don't seem to have anyone on our side who has been, you know, someone like a cabinet officer.
[3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:38.680]  I know we have some of these former officials, but we don't have anyone who's actually had to give up anything who has actually taken a risk and lost everything to Opposed Bush.
[3:02:38.680 --> 3:02:43.680]  What about Cynthia McKinney? I mean, she's not in office now, but she did it.
[3:02:43.680 --> 3:02:47.680]  I mean, she held an actual 9-11 truth event on Capitol Hill.
[3:02:47.680 --> 3:02:51.680]  Not only that, she confronted Rumsfeld about the missing trillions and the war games that morning.
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:54.680]  She was the first person to go public about that.
[3:02:54.680 --> 3:02:58.680]  Cynthia McKinney was not in their camp.
[3:02:58.680 --> 3:03:08.680]  You don't have anyone who has said, I'm going to now join the forces of truth from where I was.
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:11.680]  Well, I would say Scott McClellan did a little bit.
[3:03:11.680 --> 3:03:14.680]  Paul O'Neill, the Secretary of Treasury did it a little bit.
[3:03:14.680 --> 3:03:21.680]  I mean, they did small things, but to have them come out for 9-11 truth, probably not going to happen. I mean, let's just be honest.
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:27.680]  Look at Richard Clark. You know, he's the one that bellows before the 9-11 Commission that, oh, I'm so sorry.
[3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:31.680]  I'm going to apologize. We screwed up that day, but he's on this new BBC special.
[3:03:31.680 --> 3:03:32.680]  He's talking about...
[3:03:32.680 --> 3:03:34.680]  Marshall Bezos. Clark, right? He's...
[3:03:34.680 --> 3:03:35.680]  Richard Clark.
[3:03:35.680 --> 3:03:37.680]  Yeah, Richard Clark.
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:46.680]  It's not that I'm arguing. It's just that I see a certain dynamic at work.
[3:03:46.680 --> 3:03:52.680]  Now, we had a William Odom, who was the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[3:03:52.680 --> 3:03:55.680]  I'm not quite sure with the name, but go ahead.
[3:03:55.680 --> 3:04:03.680]  He denounced Bush vehemently on the Charlie Rose show a couple of years ago, but he just passed.
[3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:04.680]  Yeah, but so did...
[3:04:04.680 --> 3:04:07.680]  The military did a bit of...
[3:04:07.680 --> 3:04:12.680]  But so is Brzezinski. You know, all these guys love to pick on Bush because he's a huge target and an easy one of that.
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:17.680]  I mean, the guy is obviously, you know, he's not the smartest guy in the world. He's not the best speechwriter.
[3:04:17.680 --> 3:04:21.680]  He's an easy target, in my opinion, and I just don't think anybody's gone that hardcore.
[3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:27.680]  I guess I could say that Kurt Weldon also sacrificed a lot as a congressman from Pennsylvania.
[3:04:27.680 --> 3:04:30.680]  I thank you for the call, Fred. We're going to jump through your calls on this side.
[3:04:30.680 --> 3:04:34.680]  And remember, 9-Eleven Truth Rising out now, PrismPlanet.tv.
[3:04:45.680 --> 3:04:53.680]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra, and we knew what to do.
[3:04:53.680 --> 3:04:54.680]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:04:54.680 --> 3:05:01.680]  9-Eleven Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-Eleven film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:05:01.680 --> 3:05:10.680]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:05:10.680 --> 3:05:17.680]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-Eleven Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:05:17.680 --> 3:05:20.680]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:05:20.680 --> 3:05:26.680]  He takes his hand off, and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:05:26.680 --> 3:05:29.680]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[3:05:38.680 --> 3:05:51.680]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.

[3:06:44.680 --> 3:06:47.680]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[3:06:47.680 --> 3:06:49.680]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[3:06:49.680 --> 3:06:56.680]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel, and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney,
[3:06:56.680 --> 3:07:02.680]  finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online from my desk with WebEx.
[3:07:02.680 --> 3:07:05.680]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[3:07:05.680 --> 3:07:10.680]  I just talk to clients on the phone, and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop,
[3:07:10.680 --> 3:07:33.680]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[3:07:44.680 --> 3:07:49.680]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones Show,
[3:07:49.680 --> 3:07:52.680]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:08:04.680 --> 3:08:06.680]  Alright, we're going to play another clip,
[3:08:06.680 --> 3:08:13.680]  and I got to play this one because it really just shows how the British power really never left,
[3:08:13.680 --> 3:08:18.680]  how we're in bed with them, the royal family, are not good people.
[3:08:18.680 --> 3:08:23.680]  This is a big toasting, I think, with Nelson Rockefeller, Queen Elizabeth,
[3:08:23.680 --> 3:08:28.680]  and Gerald Ford when he was the vice president of the United States, a big love fest,
[3:08:28.680 --> 3:08:33.680]  and let's just play the clip. It was on C-Span the other day.
[3:08:33.680 --> 3:08:39.680]  Oh, old history. This is 1976, folks.
[3:08:39.680 --> 3:08:48.680]  We also look forward with confidence to working for a better life for all humanity.
[3:08:48.680 --> 3:08:55.680]  In our third century, I know that the United Kingdom will be on our side,
[3:08:55.680 --> 3:09:07.680]  and the United States will be on your side.
[3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:17.680]  Your Royal Highness, ladies and gentlemen, the Queen.
[3:09:17.680 --> 3:09:33.680]  Queen.
[3:09:33.680 --> 3:09:46.680]  Permanence, Anglo-American friendship.
[3:09:46.680 --> 3:09:49.680]  It has grown and prospered down the years.
[3:09:49.680 --> 3:09:55.680]  It has brought with it benefits beyond measure to our peoples.
[3:09:55.680 --> 3:10:00.680]  May it long continue to flourish for the sake of both our countries
[3:10:00.680 --> 3:10:05.680]  and for the greater good of mankind.
[3:10:05.680 --> 3:10:11.680]  Mr. President, I raise my glass to you and to Mrs. Ford,
[3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:29.680]  the 200th birthday of America, and of the happiness of our staunch and generous people.
[3:10:29.680 --> 3:10:36.680]  There it is, folks. Just a big, old love fest between Nelson Rockefeller, Gerald Ford, and the Queen.
[3:10:36.680 --> 3:10:45.680]  On Independence Day, it's actually on 777. It's a few days after, but in remembrance of the 200th anniversary of this country.
[3:10:45.680 --> 3:10:53.680]  Unfortunately, the British royal family likes to joke and goof on each other overseas.
[3:10:53.680 --> 3:10:58.680]  They own most of the tabloids. Prince Philip does that on purpose to make it look like they don't have any power.
[3:10:58.680 --> 3:11:01.680]  Well, they do. They've got a ton of power.
[3:11:01.680 --> 3:11:05.680]  The royalty has never left. These people really do think that they're better than us.
[3:11:05.680 --> 3:11:10.680]  I mean, did you hear her voice? Yes. The Queen and everything is good.
[3:11:10.680 --> 3:11:16.680]  And we shall prosper with our Anglo-American friendship forever.
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:20.680]  Makes me ill. When are people going to wake up?
[3:11:20.680 --> 3:11:26.680]  I mean, I guess a few people may have woken up overseas when they killed die, because a lot of people are hip to that fact.
[3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:30.680]  But, you know, again, Prince Charles, not a good person. Prince Philip especially.
[3:11:30.680 --> 3:11:36.680]  Prince Philip's a huge eugenicist. You know, he talked about population control. He doesn't want me and you alive.
[3:11:36.680 --> 3:11:45.680]  Dodie Fayed's father, he got on the stern show and said that Prince Philip was a Nazi and a cultist,
[3:11:45.680 --> 3:11:49.680]  and that he was a homosexual and all these other things.
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:51.680]  And of course, Prince Philip can't do anything about it.
[3:11:51.680 --> 3:11:53.680]  He's like, do you think Prince Philip's going to try to sue me?
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:56.680]  He's like, he's a rich man. He could do it. I'm a rich man. He could get money out of me.
[3:11:56.680 --> 3:11:58.680]  He's like, but everything I'm saying is true.
[3:11:58.680 --> 3:12:01.680]  Look into it. Check that interview out. It's a really good one.
[3:12:01.680 --> 3:12:04.680]  All right. Let's see if Jeff in Massachusetts is still on the line.
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:06.680]  Jeff, are you with me?
[3:12:06.680 --> 3:12:08.680]  Jeff, you're there.
[3:12:08.680 --> 3:12:10.680]  Yes, I'm right here.
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:11.680]  All right. What's up, man?
[3:12:11.680 --> 3:12:19.680]  Oh, yes. Now, as far as the sheeple is concerned, I believe that the demise of America will come in a two-prong fashion.
[3:12:19.680 --> 3:12:25.680]  First off, at least in my neck of the woods, most of the sheeple really don't care about politics.
[3:12:25.680 --> 3:12:30.680]  They just want a politician to butter their bread, give them the bacon.
[3:12:30.680 --> 3:12:37.680]  And once the bacon runs out, then you have rioting and stuff like that, then martial law will be imposed.
[3:12:37.680 --> 3:12:46.680]  Once martial law is imposed, there's going to be no more radio, no more conservative alternative media, absolutely nothing.
[3:12:46.680 --> 3:12:54.680]  And that's what I'm afraid of. I don't want to be afraid, but that's a day I dread because once freedom has been stifled, I mean, that's it.
[3:12:54.680 --> 3:13:01.680]  Well, the thing is that that would only happen locally unless there was some kind of a big contrived provocateur event such as a dirty bomb or a bio attack.
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:08.680]  I mean, you're not going to get that even in a local riot because of some political leader.
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:17.680]  I don't see that happening. What worries me, however, is the release of a bio weapon or a dirty bomb or a nuke going off in the United States?
[3:13:17.680 --> 3:13:29.680]  Because then a lot of people on that sheeple level who do not follow politics whatsoever are going to be more than willing to go to the camps to give up their homes to do anything that the government tells them to do.
[3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:33.680]  And that's where the real problem is. That's where I believe they could cut off our communications.
[3:13:33.680 --> 3:13:38.680]  That's when they could cut off the internet. That's when these radio shows wouldn't be possible anymore.
[3:13:38.680 --> 3:13:44.680]  But that's why radio shows like this one are on shortwave, you know, so they can't take us down all the way.
[3:13:44.680 --> 3:13:49.680]  They can stop us on AM and FM. They may be even able to regulate us on the internet.
[3:13:49.680 --> 3:13:53.680]  But shortwave radios are the ones that people listen to in disasters, man.
[3:13:53.680 --> 3:14:01.680]  No, no, no. You're absolutely right. And the part about the dirty bomb, I thought about that, too, because I'm studying to be an EMT.
[3:14:01.680 --> 3:14:06.680]  If a dirty bomb ever went off, the paramedics and the EMTs will not want to touch that.
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:14.680]  And there's only so many bad teams to go around. And if a dirty bomb goes off anywhere, guess what?
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:18.680]  The bad teams get choked off. And you know what?
[3:14:18.680 --> 3:14:23.680]  I believe eventually America is going to surrender and give up its sovereignty to Russia and China in the Middle East.
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:27.680]  But first, we're going to have martial law. But I just hope that doesn't happen.
[3:14:27.680 --> 3:14:33.680]  Well, a lot of people are talking about that Russia-Chinese alliance to bring in World War III very possible.
[3:14:33.680 --> 3:14:40.680]  It might be on the horizon. I'm more concerned about the Middle East right now, but that doesn't mean that's not in the back of my mind.
[3:14:40.680 --> 3:14:45.680]  I thank you for the call. All right, let's pop to Ellie in Toronto. Ellie, are you there?
[3:14:45.680 --> 3:14:47.680]  Hey, Sean, how are you doing, man?
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:48.680]  How are you doing, man?
[3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:59.680]  Sean, first off, before I go ahead, I'd just like to let you know that I'm a great fan of your movies,
[3:14:59.680 --> 3:15:11.680]  especially Loose Change, Final Cut. Although I still run into people who are still thinking it's like a conspiracy theory.
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:13.680]  And God knows what. I'm sure you do, too.
[3:15:13.680 --> 3:15:14.680]  Oh, sure.
[3:15:14.680 --> 3:15:21.680]  Okay. Anyway, I want to comment in regards to the...
[3:15:21.680 --> 3:15:26.680]  I think you said North American Union?
[3:15:26.680 --> 3:15:28.680]  North American Union?
[3:15:28.680 --> 3:15:37.680]  Yeah, no, it wasn't about North American Union. You were commenting on how you guys don't make a lot of stuff anymore.
[3:15:37.680 --> 3:15:43.680]  You know, it's like completely almost everything is shipped overseas.
[3:15:43.680 --> 3:15:51.680]  Well, I do agree in regards to that when it comes to general public or civilian type products.
[3:15:51.680 --> 3:16:01.680]  But when it comes to military arms, like jet planes, radar equipment, surface to air missiles, and God knows what else.
[3:16:01.680 --> 3:16:07.680]  United States is still one of the top manufacturers of arms.
[3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:12.680]  Maybe that is one of the reasons...
[3:16:12.680 --> 3:16:19.680]  I'm sure you remember Larry Nichols when he was on the show talking to Alex Jones.
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:25.680]  Sure, Larry Nichols is the one that exposed the Clintons and the Clintons, and shows the false left-right paradigm.
[3:16:25.680 --> 3:16:33.680]  We love conflict because this is how we ensure control.
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:42.680]  And I think the best way, the United States, AKA globally, they get control.
[3:16:42.680 --> 3:16:48.680]  One of the ways is by supplying arms, especially jets.
[3:16:48.680 --> 3:16:56.680]  And once you have a jet, like an F-16 or any other jet, you rely on the spare parts.
[3:16:56.680 --> 3:17:04.680]  And this way they have control over the mass military that may be there.
[3:17:04.680 --> 3:17:11.680]  Well, absolutely. These things are outsourced to private companies all the time, like Lockheed Martin and Ray Theon and Boeing.
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:18.680]  And a lot of it remains classified, but yeah, that's what we make the problem is that's not for public consumption, it's on a very limited level.
[3:17:18.680 --> 3:17:24.680]  And the people that are getting rich aren't the people that are working in the factories, and they're few and far between anyway.
[3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:28.680]  It's the people at the top, the people that have moved over to Dubai, I mean, to get out of this country.
[3:17:28.680 --> 3:17:35.680]  It's absolutely ludicrous stuff. Thank you for the call. Let's move to Dave in California. What's happening, Dave?
[3:17:35.680 --> 3:17:41.680]  Jason, happy birthday America, man. I hear you. I hear you. You guys are great.
[3:17:41.680 --> 3:17:45.680]  If you're there, if you're listening, man, we love you. We're not giving up.
[3:17:45.680 --> 3:17:50.680]  Whoever it is that thinks that we're going to roll over for China or Russia or any of them.
[3:17:50.680 --> 3:17:56.680]  Obama, it does not matter. The truth is out. It is out. It's never going to get put back in the can.
[3:17:56.680 --> 3:18:03.680]  They can try. They can fake things out. They can lie. They can put their little pendants up there and they can scream at us.
[3:18:03.680 --> 3:18:10.680]  Nothing is working anymore. We've got DVDs everywhere. People are waking up. It's just not going to stop.
[3:18:10.680 --> 3:18:14.680]  It's not going to stop. And I love the enthusiasm. Have you seen Truth Rising yet?
[3:18:14.680 --> 3:18:20.680]  Not yet, but I've got it on order. But listen, let me do something for you real fast. You said you were looking for fireworks.
[3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:25.680]  You might want to take your earphones off.
[3:18:25.680 --> 3:18:33.680]  All right, we can't have fireworks on the air, but thank you, Dave. Oh, that's good stuff. See, that's what I like. I like a little bit of enthusiasm.
[3:18:33.680 --> 3:18:40.680]  I like people that are psyched about, you know, independence. You know, maybe I should put a little, little Metallica ecstasy gold in this little ramp,
[3:18:40.680 --> 3:18:45.680]  because this is going to be my little independence ramp. You know, I love this country.
[3:18:45.680 --> 3:18:50.680]  You don't, you don't even know how much I love this country. A lot of people say they love this country.
[3:18:50.680 --> 3:19:03.680]  Well, I love it. It's Independence Day. And I got to tell you, if we want our independence, if we truly want to be a free people,
[3:19:03.680 --> 3:19:11.680]  we must rise. We must stand up against these globalists, these tyrants.
[3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:19.680]  The people that want to put us in their privatized prisons, the people that want to charge $5 a gallon of gas, maybe 10.
[3:19:19.680 --> 3:19:29.680]  The people that want to force vaccinations on us. Vaccinations filled with cancer viruses, with mercury and poison to dumb us down.
[3:19:29.680 --> 3:19:37.680]  The people that fluoridate our water. This is why I do this radio show, because I do love America. I love this country.
[3:19:37.680 --> 3:19:47.680]  I want my Constitution and Bill of Rights back. Is that so much? Or are we going to step up?
[3:19:47.680 --> 3:19:54.680]  This is the triumph of reducing government debt. But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999,
[3:19:54.680 --> 3:20:02.680]  reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:08.680]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[3:20:08.680 --> 3:20:16.680]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%. It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[3:20:16.680 --> 3:20:22.680]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[3:20:32.680 --> 3:20:45.680]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt. Call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:20:45.680 --> 3:20:53.680]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[3:20:53.680 --> 3:20:57.680]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[3:20:57.680 --> 3:21:01.680]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[3:21:01.680 --> 3:21:11.680]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.

[3:21:16.680 --> 3:21:23.680]  This easy fix supply gives you two months worth of three great meals a day. The cost about five dollars a day.
[3:21:23.680 --> 3:21:31.680]  eFoodsDirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of super food at half the cost of last year's groceries.

[3:21:44.680 --> 3:21:49.680]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[3:21:49.680 --> 3:21:54.680]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:21:54.680 --> 3:21:59.680]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[3:21:59.680 --> 3:22:13.680]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:22:13.680 --> 3:22:18.680]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:22.680]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:22:22.680 --> 3:22:25.680]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:30.680]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[3:22:39.680 --> 3:22:44.680]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[3:22:44.680 --> 3:22:48.680]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:22:48.680 --> 3:22:53.680]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:22:53.680 --> 3:22:58.680]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:22:58.680 --> 3:23:05.680]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron.
[3:23:05.680 --> 3:23:09.680]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[3:23:09.680 --> 3:23:15.680]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[3:23:15.680 --> 3:23:21.680]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:23:21.680 --> 3:23:28.680]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[3:23:57.680 --> 3:24:08.680]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
[3:24:08.680 --> 3:24:19.680]  I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.
[3:24:19.680 --> 3:24:29.680]  The needle tears the hole, the old familiar stain.
[3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:40.680]  Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything.
[3:24:40.680 --> 3:24:43.680]  What have I become?
[3:24:43.680 --> 3:24:53.680]  We're back on Independence Day folks.
[3:24:53.680 --> 3:25:00.680]  And today is the day for truth rising, the 9-11 Chronicles Part 1.
[3:25:00.680 --> 3:25:05.680]  It's live at PrismPlanet.tv and the highest quality we've ever offered anything.
[3:25:05.680 --> 3:25:12.680]  And quite frankly, this is getting four star reviews. People are very impressed. Let's read through some of these reviews.
[3:25:12.680 --> 3:25:16.680]  Alex's best film ever, Five Stars. Alex nailed it.
[3:25:16.680 --> 3:25:22.680]  This may wake up more people than lose change. It's unbelievable.
[3:25:22.680 --> 3:25:50.680]  And we are just so proud of this movie. In fact, let's play a little sneak peek of truth rising right now.
[3:25:50.680 --> 3:25:57.680]  What's up tonight?
[3:25:57.680 --> 3:26:02.680]  Guess who's going to jail? Guess who's going to jail?
[3:26:02.680 --> 3:26:05.680]  They think he's got a bomb in his bag.
[3:26:05.680 --> 3:26:08.680]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was the stage?
[3:26:08.680 --> 3:26:14.680]  Was it engineered by you, David Boccafella, the collateral commission, the CAF, and Bilderberg Group, sir?
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:18.680]  Answer my question.
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:20.680]  How do you see the pain?
[3:26:20.680 --> 3:26:25.680]  We love this country. We should treat our police officers, our fire department, our first responders who respect us, sir.
[3:26:25.680 --> 3:26:31.680]  They're getting no respect from you for what you're doing to them, sir.
[3:26:31.680 --> 3:26:35.680]  That's my roommate. That's his medication.
[3:26:35.680 --> 3:26:40.680]  Can this side of the room, everybody stand up?
[3:26:40.680 --> 3:26:47.680]  Everybody on this side through all rescue workers will be dead in four years.
[3:26:47.680 --> 3:26:50.680]  Are you there?
[3:26:50.680 --> 3:26:54.680]  Are you there?
[3:26:54.680 --> 3:26:56.680]  We're here to defend America.
[3:26:56.680 --> 3:26:57.680]  Yeah, right.
[3:26:57.680 --> 3:26:59.680]  That's right.
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:02.680]  You ain't an American. Come on.
[3:27:02.680 --> 3:27:07.680]  When are you going to investigate World Trade Center 7, sir?
[3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:12.680]  You made a promise, sir.
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:20.680]  The whole hill is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. If violence breaks out, don't worry, we can handle it.
[3:27:20.680 --> 3:27:34.680]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:35.680]  Hey, guys.
[3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:36.680]  It's true.
[3:27:36.680 --> 3:27:41.680]  An inside job, how dare you?
[3:27:41.680 --> 3:27:48.680]  Why did Bush not even want to investigate the attack?
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:59.680]  Turn the camera off.
[3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:00.680]  No, sir.
[3:28:00.680 --> 3:28:01.680]  Turn the camera off.
[3:28:01.680 --> 3:28:02.680]  No, sir.
[3:28:02.680 --> 3:28:11.680]  Can I ask you why you're taking my picture?
[3:28:11.680 --> 3:28:30.680]  I have it right so you're on the public side.
[3:28:30.680 --> 3:28:34.680]  Give me goosebumps every time I watch it.
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:41.680]  Get the high quality DVD over at infowars.com right now or go to prismplanet.tv to see it in the utmost quality.

[3:28:45.680 --> 3:28:49.680]  I really can't wait for people to take this, burn this and share it with others.
[3:28:49.680 --> 3:28:50.680]  Today is the day.
[3:28:50.680 --> 3:28:51.680]  It's the 4th of July.
[3:28:51.680 --> 3:28:54.680]  There's a ton of barbecues, a ton of family get-togethers.
[3:28:54.680 --> 3:28:57.680]  What better day for the truth to rise?
[3:28:57.680 --> 3:29:00.680]  All right, before we go back to callers, I would like to thank eFoodsDirect.
[3:29:00.680 --> 3:29:02.680]  They help make this show possible.
[3:29:02.680 --> 3:29:05.680]  They are one of our biggest sponsors.
[3:29:05.680 --> 3:29:10.680]  And you go to www.eFoodsDirect.com right now to go check out their stuff.
[3:29:10.680 --> 3:29:13.680]  We don't need to remain, remind you you need food to survive, folks.
[3:29:13.680 --> 3:29:16.680]  eFoodsDirect has the best storeable food out there.
[3:29:16.680 --> 3:29:19.680]  It is eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:29:19.680 --> 3:29:21.680]  And we'll be back after this.
[3:29:21.680 --> 3:29:22.680]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[3:29:22.680 --> 3:29:34.680]  I'm Jason Bermas, LooseChange911.com.
[3:29:34.680 --> 3:29:36.680]  We're on the march.
[3:29:36.680 --> 3:29:38.680]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:38.680 --> 3:29:44.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:44.680 --> 3:29:59.680]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil unrest and panic.
[3:29:59.680 --> 3:30:03.680]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[3:30:03.680 --> 3:30:10.680]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels of corn alone.
[3:30:10.680 --> 3:30:14.680]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.
[3:30:14.680 --> 3:30:19.680]  Paul Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202 for a free catalog.
[3:30:19.680 --> 3:30:29.680]  Larry Matlak, president of the American Agriculture Movement, stated on June 6 that the USDA has only enough wheat stored to make one half of a loaf of bread for every American.

[3:30:39.680 --> 3:30:41.680]  At Now.
[3:31:11.680 --> 3:31:16.680]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:31:16.680 --> 3:31:21.680]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:31:21.680 --> 3:31:27.680]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:31:27.680 --> 3:31:30.680]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:31:30.680 --> 3:31:35.680]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9th Avenue.
[3:31:35.680 --> 3:31:41.680]  Truth Rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:31:41.680 --> 3:31:44.680]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:31:44.680 --> 3:31:45.680]  I can't believe it.
[3:31:45.680 --> 3:31:47.680]  It truly is amazing.
[3:31:47.680 --> 3:31:50.680]  You have to care enough about yourself to want to do something.
[3:31:50.680 --> 3:31:53.680]  If you're tired of feeling sick or run down, this truly is the answer.
[3:31:53.680 --> 3:31:55.680]  I have so much energy now.
[3:31:55.680 --> 3:31:57.680]  It makes you feel good.
[3:31:57.680 --> 3:31:58.680]  And it's all natural.
[3:31:58.680 --> 3:32:00.680]  Everyone in my family takes Cardivite.
[3:32:00.680 --> 3:32:01.680]  Cardivite.
[3:32:01.680 --> 3:32:03.680]  We all use Cardivite.
[3:32:03.680 --> 3:32:07.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.
[3:32:07.680 --> 3:32:12.680]  Cardivite is an all-natural supplement which is made up of our own special blend of herbs,

[3:32:29.680 --> 3:32:33.680]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[3:32:33.680 --> 3:32:36.680]  Cardivite is a natural thing.
[3:32:36.680 --> 3:32:41.680]  It gives you the edge like you've never seen.
[3:32:41.680 --> 3:32:43.680]  It makes you feel good.
[3:32:43.680 --> 3:32:44.680]  Cardivite.
[3:32:44.680 --> 3:32:47.680]  Federal agents, we are armed.
[3:32:47.680 --> 3:32:52.680]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[3:32:52.680 --> 3:32:55.680]  Would you stand up for truth?
[3:32:55.680 --> 3:32:58.680]  Or would you turn away too?
[3:32:58.680 --> 3:33:03.680]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[3:33:03.680 --> 3:33:06.680]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[3:33:06.680 --> 3:33:08.680]  Or would you turn away?
[3:33:08.680 --> 3:33:13.680]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[3:33:13.680 --> 3:33:16.680]  Would you stand up for truth?
[3:33:16.680 --> 3:33:19.680]  Or would you turn away too?
[3:33:19.680 --> 3:33:24.680]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[3:33:24.680 --> 3:33:27.680]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[3:33:27.680 --> 3:33:29.680]  Or would you turn away?
[3:33:29.680 --> 3:33:32.680]  I see a message from the government, like every day.
[3:33:32.680 --> 3:33:35.680]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[3:33:35.680 --> 3:33:37.680]  They wanted me about Osama or whatever.
[3:33:37.680 --> 3:33:40.680]  Picture me buying this scam, I said never.
[3:33:40.680 --> 3:33:43.680]  You in tune to a hard truth, soldiers spitting.
[3:33:43.680 --> 3:33:47.680]  It's all a part of fighting devil state mind control.
[3:33:47.680 --> 3:33:50.680]  And all about the battle for your body, mind and soul.
[3:33:50.680 --> 3:33:53.680]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind, so they shape you.
[3:33:53.680 --> 3:33:55.680]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us AIDS and rapes.
[3:33:55.680 --> 3:33:58.680]  Another push, season, mean another war for profit.
[3:33:58.680 --> 3:34:01.680]  All in secret, so the public never fit to stop it.
[3:34:01.680 --> 3:34:03.680]  The Illuminati, triple six, all connected.
[3:34:03.680 --> 3:34:06.680]  Stole the boats, they control the race and take elections.
[3:34:06.680 --> 3:34:08.680]  All right, folks, it's Independence Day.
[3:34:08.680 --> 3:34:12.680]  And I want to remind people.
[3:34:12.680 --> 3:34:15.680]  There is going to be big events down in New York City.
[3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:18.680]  For some reason, Luke missed out on the interview today.
[3:34:18.680 --> 3:34:20.680]  I don't know why he might be down in New York City right now,
[3:34:20.680 --> 3:34:21.680]  down at Ground Zero.
[3:34:21.680 --> 3:34:23.680]  But regardless, there's going to be huge events.
[3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:27.680]  WeAreChanged.org is where to go check out where and when
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:29.680]  those events are going to be taking place.
[3:34:29.680 --> 3:34:33.680]  And as of now, it looks like I will be down there showing
[3:34:33.680 --> 3:34:34.680]  fabled enemies.
[3:34:34.680 --> 3:34:36.680]  My new film, possibly some other films are going to be
[3:34:36.680 --> 3:34:37.680]  shown down there.
[3:34:37.680 --> 3:34:39.680]  It should be a really great time.
[3:34:39.680 --> 3:34:41.680]  All right, let's jump to some callers.
[3:34:41.680 --> 3:34:43.680]  Let's go to Chris in New Jersey.
[3:34:43.680 --> 3:34:45.680]  Chris, what's up?
[3:34:45.680 --> 3:34:47.680]  Well, hey, Jason.
[3:34:47.680 --> 3:34:48.680]  How you doing, man?
[3:34:48.680 --> 3:34:49.680]  All right.
[3:34:49.680 --> 3:34:52.680]  Hey, I just, I downloaded 9-Eleven Chronicles last night.
[3:34:52.680 --> 3:34:53.680]  Awesome.
[3:34:53.680 --> 3:34:55.680]  Watched it all at about one o'clock in the morning.
[3:34:55.680 --> 3:34:59.680]  And I know Alex was talking on the show about it being
[3:34:59.680 --> 3:35:01.680]  an inspiration to others to get involved.
[3:35:01.680 --> 3:35:04.680]  And I've been involved in my own local area.
[3:35:04.680 --> 3:35:08.680]  But being 45 minutes out from New York City, send Luke a message
[3:35:08.680 --> 3:35:11.680]  and let him know that I'll be joining him at Ground Zero
[3:35:11.680 --> 3:35:12.680]  sometime soon.
[3:35:12.680 --> 3:35:13.680]  Excellent.
[3:35:13.680 --> 3:35:14.680]  Excellent.
[3:35:14.680 --> 3:35:15.680]  So you watched it.
[3:35:15.680 --> 3:35:16.680]  Tell the people what it's about.
[3:35:16.680 --> 3:35:18.680]  You know, I've been stringing on it all day.
[3:35:18.680 --> 3:35:21.680]  You tell people what is 9-Eleven Chronicles truth rising.
[3:35:21.680 --> 3:35:26.680]  Well, what I got out of it is that, you know, it's kind of going
[3:35:26.680 --> 3:35:30.680]  away from 9-Eleven being an inside job per se and not really
[3:35:30.680 --> 3:35:32.680]  focusing on that.
[3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:35.680]  The first half of it, what I got from it was that you guys
[3:35:35.680 --> 3:35:39.680]  really concentrated on the first responders and some of the
[3:35:39.680 --> 3:35:41.680]  injustices that happened to them afterwards.
[3:35:41.680 --> 3:35:42.680]  Absolutely.
[3:35:42.680 --> 3:35:43.680]  Absolutely.
[3:35:43.680 --> 3:35:45.680]  And just seeing all those videos, too.
[3:35:45.680 --> 3:35:48.680]  I mean, I've seen a lot of them on YouTube with Mark Dice and Luke
[3:35:48.680 --> 3:35:50.680]  and all the other We Are Changed guys.
[3:35:50.680 --> 3:35:54.680]  But just seeing them again, I mean, some parts I felt like crying
[3:35:54.680 --> 3:35:56.680]  and other parts I felt like laughing.
[3:35:56.680 --> 3:35:59.680]  Well, that's what it's all about is that it has an upbeat sense,
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:01.680]  but some of this material is so strong.
[3:36:01.680 --> 3:36:03.680]  And you mentioned how it really begins with the first responders
[3:36:03.680 --> 3:36:06.680]  plight. Well, it ends with the first responders plight, too.
[3:36:06.680 --> 3:36:09.680]  And it ends really with Dennis Kasinich saying, you know, he's
[3:36:09.680 --> 3:36:11.680]  going to be asking questions and getting documents.
[3:36:11.680 --> 3:36:14.680]  And that 35th article of impeachment was because the Bush
[3:36:14.680 --> 3:36:18.680]  administration lied about the air quality to the EPA and put
[3:36:18.680 --> 3:36:21.680]  all those first responders in early graves, essentially,
[3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:23.680]  and gave them health problems.
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:26.680]  So, you know, this is a multi-tiered film, I think, for
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:28.680]  people that are uninitiated that don't know about the 9-Eleven
[3:36:28.680 --> 3:36:29.680]  Truth Movement.
[3:36:29.680 --> 3:36:32.680]  I think it's also an attractive movie to bring them in.
[3:36:32.680 --> 3:36:35.680]  I mean, like you just said, you've been active in your own area,
[3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:37.680]  but after seeing this, you're ready to go to New York City
[3:36:37.680 --> 3:36:39.680]  and join Luke Radowski.
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:41.680]  Absolutely.
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:43.680]  All right, Chris, I thank you for the kind words, man.
[3:36:43.680 --> 3:36:45.680]  Keep spreading the truth, burning copies.
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:47.680]  Hopefully, you got that DivEx version.
[3:36:47.680 --> 3:36:49.680]  Let's jump over to Frank in New York.
[3:36:49.680 --> 3:36:50.680]  What's going on, Frank?
[3:36:50.680 --> 3:36:51.680]  Hi, how are you doing?
[3:36:51.680 --> 3:36:54.680]  I want to wish you and Alex and everyone a happy fourth.
[3:36:54.680 --> 3:36:59.680]  And I wanted to just ask you a question, and that is,
[3:36:59.680 --> 3:37:03.680]  your event is going to be down at Ground Zero, correct?
[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:04.680]  The screening?
[3:37:04.680 --> 3:37:07.680]  I don't know if the screening will absolutely be at Ground Zero.
[3:37:07.680 --> 3:37:09.680]  In other words, we're not going to just set up cameras
[3:37:09.680 --> 3:37:11.680]  outside or a projector outside of Ground Zero,
[3:37:11.680 --> 3:37:13.680]  but it'll be down in Lower Manhattan somewhere.
[3:37:13.680 --> 3:37:15.680]  Okay, I'm going to try to get there tonight
[3:37:15.680 --> 3:37:17.680]  before the fireworks.
[3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:22.680]  But what I wanted to talk about is Gord Vidal's excellent
[3:37:22.680 --> 3:37:28.680]  interview with the Iranian press that was published
[3:37:28.680 --> 3:37:31.680]  on Saturday, on the 28th.
[3:37:31.680 --> 3:37:33.680]  And it's really entitled,
[3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:35.680]  The U.S. Is Not a Republic Anymore.
[3:37:35.680 --> 3:37:38.680]  It really means that the U.S.
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:41.680]  is not a constitutional republic anymore.
[3:37:41.680 --> 3:37:45.680]  And it's an excellent interview with various
[3:37:45.680 --> 3:37:48.680]  and comments that Gord Vidal has been making
[3:37:48.680 --> 3:37:49.680]  over the last 20 years.
[3:37:49.680 --> 3:37:54.680]  But it's so cogent that I think everyone should read it.
[3:37:54.680 --> 3:37:56.680]  And I'm not at all surprised that The New York Times
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:38:01.680]  or The Washington Post chose not to run the story.
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:04.680]  But it's one of the best that's been getting lots of airplay
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:05.680]  in England.
[3:38:05.680 --> 3:38:11.680]  In fact, it was actually in The Times on Sunday in London.
[3:38:11.680 --> 3:38:13.680]  It's really interesting.
[3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:16.680]  The only people that seem to not know what's happening
[3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:18.680]  are those here in the States.
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:20.680]  And I don't mean the people listening to your show.
[3:38:20.680 --> 3:38:25.680]  But what I wanted to say, too, is that I also wanted to thank
[3:38:25.680 --> 3:38:27.680]  percentage and also Professor Boyle,
[3:38:27.680 --> 3:38:31.680]  who has been working on articles of impeachment since 2003.
[3:38:31.680 --> 3:38:35.680]  And I think it's time that we hold our Congress
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:37.680]  and our senators accountable,
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:40.680]  and we demand that Bush be tried for his crimes
[3:38:40.680 --> 3:38:43.680]  against the American people, American treaties,
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:44.680]  and the Constitution.
[3:38:44.680 --> 3:38:49.680]  And if we are too panty-waisted to bring Bush to trial
[3:38:49.680 --> 3:38:51.680]  with impeachment and his wartime cabinet,
[3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:53.680]  including the vice president,
[3:38:53.680 --> 3:38:57.680]  I think it's time that we extradite him to the Hague to stand trial
[3:38:57.680 --> 3:39:00.680]  at the Court of International Justice.
[3:39:00.680 --> 3:39:04.680]  Let the Iraqi people then try him in Baghdad.
[3:39:04.680 --> 3:39:06.680]  Well, I'm with you on many levels.
[3:39:06.680 --> 3:39:07.680]  I don't know about the Hague,
[3:39:07.680 --> 3:39:10.680]  but I do want people to go to Cassinage.us right now.
[3:39:10.680 --> 3:39:11.680]  And we played that.
[3:39:11.680 --> 3:39:12.680]  Did you hear that Cassinage clip earlier today?
[3:39:12.680 --> 3:39:13.680]  I do.
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:15.680]  And the only thing, the reason why I'm stating the Hague
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:18.680]  is when our own system fails to act,
[3:39:18.680 --> 3:39:20.680]  there have been over a million people murdered
[3:39:20.680 --> 3:39:23.680]  by this illegal criminal Bush regime,
[3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:25.680]  and it's time to hold them accountable.
[3:39:25.680 --> 3:39:28.680]  And if our Congress can't enforce its own laws,
[3:39:28.680 --> 3:39:31.680]  then let's extradite him and let the world court try him
[3:39:31.680 --> 3:39:34.680]  for his crimes, or let the Iraqi people try him
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:35.680]  and his wartime cabinet.
[3:39:35.680 --> 3:39:36.680]  All right, Frank.
[3:39:36.680 --> 3:39:37.680]  I think that has to be done.
[3:39:37.680 --> 3:39:38.680]  Thank you, man.
[3:39:38.680 --> 3:39:39.680]  Thank you, man.
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:41.680]  You know, I'm just very, very hesitant
[3:39:41.680 --> 3:39:43.680]  to bring anything to a world tribunal
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:45.680]  because I don't trust the UN.
[3:39:45.680 --> 3:39:46.680]  If the world tribunals were so great,
[3:39:46.680 --> 3:39:49.680]  we would have had trials in the first year after 9-11.
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:51.680]  We would have had a real investigation.
[3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:53.680]  I really think that we have to do this
[3:39:53.680 --> 3:39:55.680]  from a homegrown perspective.
[3:39:55.680 --> 3:39:59.680]  Cassinage.us, Cassinage.us, Cassinage.us.
[3:39:59.680 --> 3:40:02.680]  Go to Cassinage.us right now
[3:40:02.680 --> 3:40:05.680]  and sign this petition to get these articles
[3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:07.680]  on the fast track to reality.
[3:40:07.680 --> 3:40:09.680]  He already put them before the House.
[3:40:09.680 --> 3:40:10.680]  Congress is aware.
[3:40:10.680 --> 3:40:11.680]  They don't care.
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:12.680]  They think the people are just going to fall asleep.
[3:40:12.680 --> 3:40:13.680]  They're going to lie on their backs
[3:40:13.680 --> 3:40:15.680]  in their little fetal position and be like,
[3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:16.680]  oh, I can do anything.
[3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:17.680]  Do something.
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:22.680]  Cassinage.us, go and sign the petition right away.
[3:40:22.680 --> 3:40:23.680]  All right.
[3:40:23.680 --> 3:40:24.680]  Let's take another call.
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:26.680]  Let's go to John in Michigan.
[3:40:26.680 --> 3:40:28.680]  John, how are you today?
[3:40:28.680 --> 3:40:29.680]  I'm a brother.
[3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:30.680]  Yeah, excuse me.
[3:40:30.680 --> 3:40:31.680]  What's your name?
[3:40:31.680 --> 3:40:32.680]  I'm sorry.
[3:40:32.680 --> 3:40:33.680]  I'm Jason, man.
[3:40:33.680 --> 3:40:34.680]  Jason, yeah.
[3:40:34.680 --> 3:40:37.680]  Look, I'm living in Little Town just outside of Detroit.
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:39.680]  I want to let you know that the blacks here
[3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:42.680]  are actually starting to take to the streets.
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:43.680]  Good.
[3:40:43.680 --> 3:40:45.680]  They did not walk out in the sidewalk anymore.
[3:40:45.680 --> 3:40:48.680]  And what I'm figuring is, and there's been a lot of rainy
[3:40:48.680 --> 3:40:51.680]  weather here in power outages everywhere except Detroit.
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:53.680]  But if there were to be a power outage in Detroit
[3:40:53.680 --> 3:40:56.680]  for a couple of hours, we'd have 1967 and more all over again.
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:40:57.680]  I know it.
[3:40:57.680 --> 3:40:59.680]  I just want to let you know that.
[3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:01.680]  You really think it's that politically charged out there
[3:41:01.680 --> 3:41:02.680]  in Detroit right now?
[3:41:02.680 --> 3:41:05.680]  I don't know about the political side, but they're angry.
[3:41:05.680 --> 3:41:08.680]  They're angry over their status.
[3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:12.680]  Back in the 80s, Detroit was a huge industrial town.
[3:41:12.680 --> 3:41:14.680]  Had a lot of jobs everywhere.
[3:41:14.680 --> 3:41:16.680]  And that slowly was taken away.
[3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:19.680]  That was Michael Moore's first movie, Roger and Me.
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:22.680]  And then now, I mean, there's not much there, is there?
[3:41:22.680 --> 3:41:25.680]  Like I said, there's been power outages everywhere except
[3:41:25.680 --> 3:41:27.680]  Detroit, but about two, three hours in Detroit would start
[3:41:27.680 --> 3:41:30.680]  because they know the alarm batteries would be gone.
[3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:32.680]  And even UPS batteries would be gone.
[3:41:32.680 --> 3:41:35.680]  You know, for the pet beat computer backup.
[3:41:35.680 --> 3:41:36.680]  So that all makes sense.
[3:41:36.680 --> 3:41:37.680]  All right, man.
[3:41:37.680 --> 3:41:38.680]  I thank you for the call, John.
[3:41:38.680 --> 3:41:40.680]  Let's jump to Betty in North Carolina.
[3:41:40.680 --> 3:41:43.680]  Betty, what's up?
[3:41:43.680 --> 3:41:44.680]  Hi, Jason.
[3:41:44.680 --> 3:41:45.680]  How are you?
[3:41:45.680 --> 3:41:47.680]  I'm doing okay.
[3:41:47.680 --> 3:41:52.680]  I wanted to call and let you know that I went on,
[3:41:52.680 --> 3:41:56.680]  tried to get on the percentages website and I can't
[3:41:56.680 --> 3:42:00.680]  pull it up because I was going to vote for that.
[3:42:00.680 --> 3:42:04.680]  And also too, I've been getting emails sent to me
[3:42:04.680 --> 3:42:06.680]  about Bush's impeachment.
[3:42:06.680 --> 3:42:08.680]  And I signed up on that.
[3:42:08.680 --> 3:42:11.680]  And what I wanted to tell you was that I went on ahead
[3:42:11.680 --> 3:42:15.680]  and ordered that 9-11 truth, you know, the chronic
[3:42:15.680 --> 3:42:20.680]  whole truth rising because I've seen that 9-11 road
[3:42:20.680 --> 3:42:21.680]  to tyranny.
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:24.680]  And I think you guys are doing a great job.
[3:42:24.680 --> 3:42:25.680]  Well, thank you so much.
[3:42:25.680 --> 3:42:28.680]  Actually, I just logged on to Cassinage.us.
[3:42:28.680 --> 3:42:29.680]  The website is up.
[3:42:29.680 --> 3:42:30.680]  You may have put an extra C in there.
[3:42:30.680 --> 3:42:36.680]  For people listening, it is K-U-C-I-N-I-C-H.us.
[3:42:36.680 --> 3:42:39.680]  And he has his little address that I played earlier on top.
[3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:43.680]  He has pretty much the whole oil scenario and why we need
[3:42:43.680 --> 3:42:44.680]  to impeach Bush.
[3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:46.680]  And Betty, I thank you so much for your support with the
[3:42:46.680 --> 3:42:47.680]  movies.
[3:42:47.680 --> 3:42:49.680]  I hope that you make copies and hand them out to friends.
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:51.680]  And I hope that all of you listeners, listen again,
[3:42:51.680 --> 3:42:54.680]  all of you listeners, go to Cassinage.us.
[3:42:54.680 --> 3:42:55.680]  Sign this petition.
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:42:56.680]  Support them.
[3:42:56.680 --> 3:42:57.680]  We've got a big weekend ahead of us.
[3:42:57.680 --> 3:42:58.680]  Okay.
[3:42:58.680 --> 3:42:59.680]  This is Independence Day.
[3:42:59.680 --> 3:43:01.680]  You're going to be talking to your family.
[3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:04.680]  If your family is just as upset as you or they don't know
[3:43:04.680 --> 3:43:06.680]  why they're upset, but they still think things are wrong,
[3:43:06.680 --> 3:43:08.680]  point them to Cassinage.us.
[3:43:08.680 --> 3:43:10.680]  We need as many signatures as possible.
[3:43:10.680 --> 3:43:12.680]  I mean, this thing should be all over the news.
[3:43:12.680 --> 3:43:13.680]  It's not.
[3:43:13.680 --> 3:43:14.680]  You don't see it on CNN.
[3:43:14.680 --> 3:43:15.680]  You don't see it on Fox News.
[3:43:15.680 --> 3:43:17.680]  You don't see it on MSNBC.
[3:43:17.680 --> 3:43:20.680]  You don't see it on any flavor of the news because they want
[3:43:20.680 --> 3:43:21.680]  to keep this silent.
[3:43:21.680 --> 3:43:24.680]  They don't want you to know that a congressman who's now run
[3:43:24.680 --> 3:43:27.680]  for president twice in this country is trying to impeach
[3:43:27.680 --> 3:43:32.680]  Bush on 35 counts, 35 different articles.
[3:43:32.680 --> 3:43:33.680]  He's charged him.
[3:43:33.680 --> 3:43:34.680]  It's unbelievable.
[3:43:34.680 --> 3:43:35.680]  All right.
[3:43:35.680 --> 3:43:36.680]  Let's go to Hartwell in Louisiana.
[3:43:36.680 --> 3:43:38.680]  Hartwell, what's up?
[3:43:38.680 --> 3:43:40.680]  You with us?
[3:43:40.680 --> 3:43:41.680]  Yes, Jason.
[3:43:41.680 --> 3:43:43.680]  I'm calling to let you know that on this Independence Day,
[3:43:43.680 --> 3:43:44.680]  I am not barbecuing.
[3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:47.680]  I'm not drinking beer and I'm not looking for ball games.
[3:43:47.680 --> 3:43:49.680]  What I'm looking for is information.
[3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:51.680]  The information that you're giving.
[3:43:51.680 --> 3:43:55.680]  And I'm calling to thank you so much for being there for me.
[3:43:55.680 --> 3:43:56.680]  May God bless you.
[3:43:56.680 --> 3:43:57.680]  Well, thank you, Hartwell.
[3:43:57.680 --> 3:43:59.680]  I hope that you go and check out Truth Rising.
[3:43:59.680 --> 3:44:01.680]  And I hope if you haven't seen Loose Change Final Cut,
[3:44:01.680 --> 3:44:02.680]  you check that out too.
[3:44:02.680 --> 3:44:04.680]  And not only are you hungry for information,
[3:44:04.680 --> 3:44:07.680]  but you're hungry to share that information with others as well.
[3:44:07.680 --> 3:44:10.680]  I mean, there's nothing wrong with taking a day like today
[3:44:10.680 --> 3:44:13.680]  and enjoying the sunshine and enjoying your family.
[3:44:13.680 --> 3:44:14.680]  But we can't do that every day.
[3:44:14.680 --> 3:44:17.680]  And I really feel like the general populace is out there
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:20.680]  in these days just not carrying what's going on,
[3:44:20.680 --> 3:44:24.680]  just living day to day in a total and complete haze,
[3:44:24.680 --> 3:44:27.680]  almost a false reality, if you will, Hartwell.
[3:44:27.680 --> 3:44:28.680]  Yes.
[3:44:28.680 --> 3:44:29.680]  Well, I am.
[3:44:29.680 --> 3:44:33.680]  I spent $500 burning a professional DVD burner
[3:44:33.680 --> 3:44:35.680]  at Burns Fort one time.
[3:44:35.680 --> 3:44:36.680]  Oh, good, good, good.
[3:44:36.680 --> 3:44:38.680]  And I am doing it.
[3:44:38.680 --> 3:44:39.680]  Awesome.
[3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:40.680]  Awesome.
[3:44:40.680 --> 3:44:41.680]  That is good news.
[3:44:41.680 --> 3:44:43.680]  And I hope that you hand out thousands of those discs.
[3:44:43.680 --> 3:44:44.680]  And I know you're in Louisiana,
[3:44:44.680 --> 3:44:46.680]  but maybe you can make it out to New York this year
[3:44:46.680 --> 3:44:47.680]  for September 11th.
[3:44:47.680 --> 3:44:49.680]  The more of you that can make it out the better,
[3:44:49.680 --> 3:44:50.680]  the impact will be.
[3:44:50.680 --> 3:44:51.680]  I thank you for the call.
[3:44:51.680 --> 3:44:54.680]  Let's jump to Wade in Mississippi.
[3:44:54.680 --> 3:44:57.680]  Wade, how's your Independence Day going so far, buddy?
[3:44:57.680 --> 3:44:58.680]  So far, so good.
[3:44:58.680 --> 3:45:01.680]  I'm at work in a beautiful southwestern Louisiana,
[3:45:01.680 --> 3:45:03.680]  but I live in Mississippi.
[3:45:03.680 --> 3:45:04.680]  Got you.
[3:45:04.680 --> 3:45:05.680]  What to call them?
[3:45:05.680 --> 3:45:07.680]  Wish you all a happy Independence Day.
[3:45:07.680 --> 3:45:11.680]  And thank you for the work that you've done on 9-Eleven Loose Change,
[3:45:11.680 --> 3:45:12.680]  all three films.
[3:45:12.680 --> 3:45:13.680]  I've watched all three.
[3:45:13.680 --> 3:45:17.680]  I just watched 9-Eleven Truth Rising last night.
[3:45:17.680 --> 3:45:21.680]  And all I got to say is it really does the best job
[3:45:21.680 --> 3:45:23.680]  of saying what the real issue is,
[3:45:23.680 --> 3:45:25.680]  in getting at the first responders,
[3:45:25.680 --> 3:45:29.680]  because I myself was a firefighter before 9-Eleven in Mississippi,
[3:45:29.680 --> 3:45:33.680]  participated in Hurricane Katrina's recovery efforts
[3:45:33.680 --> 3:45:35.680]  in everything in the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
[3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:41.680]  But moving on to Dennis Kucinich's 35 articles of impeachment.
[3:45:41.680 --> 3:45:46.680]  One article of impeachment stands out to be the nail in a coffin.
[3:45:46.680 --> 3:45:48.680]  This is guaranteed 100%.
[3:45:48.680 --> 3:45:52.680]  Congress should be lynching the White House on this,
[3:45:52.680 --> 3:45:56.680]  is that Bush went to war without Congress' approval
[3:45:56.680 --> 3:45:58.680]  or formal declaration of war saying,
[3:45:58.680 --> 3:46:00.680]  yes, we can go invade a foreign country.
[3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:02.680]  That violates our U.S. Constitution.
[3:46:02.680 --> 3:46:05.680]  And anybody that doesn't understand that,
[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:07.680]  obviously didn't pay attention in history class.
[3:46:07.680 --> 3:46:08.680]  Well, absolutely.
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:10.680]  And it's all word play,
[3:46:10.680 --> 3:46:12.680]  because we're not really at war with Iraq.
[3:46:12.680 --> 3:46:13.680]  It is a conflict.
[3:46:13.680 --> 3:46:17.680]  But they can sit there up on a podium
[3:46:17.680 --> 3:46:18.680]  and say we're at war.
[3:46:18.680 --> 3:46:19.680]  We're at war.
[3:46:19.680 --> 3:46:20.680]  We're at war with a war.
[3:46:20.680 --> 3:46:22.680]  When war is never actually declared,
[3:46:22.680 --> 3:46:24.680]  and it's just a conflict that can last forever,
[3:46:24.680 --> 3:46:28.680]  and basically allow us to do anything outside of our own
[3:46:28.680 --> 3:46:29.680]  international and national rules,
[3:46:29.680 --> 3:46:31.680]  it's absolute ludicracy.
[3:46:31.680 --> 3:46:33.680]  And I agree 110% with you.
[3:46:33.680 --> 3:46:35.680]  But I think there's some other solid ones in there.
[3:46:35.680 --> 3:46:38.680]  I mean, for instance, the domestic wire tapping
[3:46:38.680 --> 3:46:39.680]  they've had to admit to.
[3:46:39.680 --> 3:46:41.680]  I mean, that one AT&T whistleblower alone
[3:46:41.680 --> 3:46:45.680]  has blown the lid off the fact that the National Security Agency
[3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:49.680]  clones almost all information from emails to phone calls
[3:46:49.680 --> 3:46:50.680]  and puts it into a database.
[3:46:50.680 --> 3:46:54.680]  I mean, that's scary stuff, and this was in place before 9-11.
[3:46:54.680 --> 3:46:56.680]  This is one of the other articles of impeachment.
[3:46:56.680 --> 3:46:57.680]  You know?
[3:46:57.680 --> 3:46:59.680]  It's absolutely amazing.
[3:46:59.680 --> 3:47:01.680]  And, you know, being a first responder,
[3:47:01.680 --> 3:47:04.680]  my experience with Hurricane Katrina,
[3:47:04.680 --> 3:47:05.680]  I'm a search and rescue coordinator
[3:47:05.680 --> 3:47:07.680]  for Hancock County, Mississippi.
[3:47:07.680 --> 3:47:08.680]  So if we have another hurricane,
[3:47:08.680 --> 3:47:10.680]  I'm the guy that's got to deal with FEMA
[3:47:10.680 --> 3:47:12.680]  and getting the USAR teams to come down
[3:47:12.680 --> 3:47:14.680]  and coordinate the rescue efforts.
[3:47:14.680 --> 3:47:17.680]  But they just had a press release that said,
[3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:20.680]  FEMA's not going to give anybody any ice.
[3:47:20.680 --> 3:47:22.680]  And ice was very critical in the survival
[3:47:22.680 --> 3:47:25.680]  in the immediate days of the aftermath of the storm
[3:47:25.680 --> 3:47:28.680]  because people have prescriptions that they have to keep cold
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:31.680]  and not just at the food that's in the refrigerators.
[3:47:31.680 --> 3:47:32.680]  If you could take a little bit of food
[3:47:32.680 --> 3:47:34.680]  that's in your refrigerator that you lost power,
[3:47:34.680 --> 3:47:36.680]  put it in an ice chest with some fresh ice.
[3:47:36.680 --> 3:47:39.680]  You can keep it a week or two in that ice chest
[3:47:39.680 --> 3:47:41.680]  as long as you have a constant supply of ice.
[3:47:41.680 --> 3:47:44.680]  But I know now that I've been reading and doing research
[3:47:44.680 --> 3:47:47.680]  on FEMA doing the online courses with FEMA Independent Study,
[3:47:47.680 --> 3:47:50.680]  FEMA wants every emergency management agency
[3:47:50.680 --> 3:47:52.680]  throughout the entire United States
[3:47:52.680 --> 3:47:54.680]  to comply with them, basically,
[3:47:54.680 --> 3:47:56.680]  where FEMA is leading the way,
[3:47:56.680 --> 3:47:58.680]  saying, you have to do what we tell you to do
[3:47:58.680 --> 3:48:00.680]  or you're not going to be involved.
[3:48:00.680 --> 3:48:01.680]  They have a five-year training matrix
[3:48:01.680 --> 3:48:04.680]  and you go to FEMA.gov and read all about it
[3:48:04.680 --> 3:48:07.680]  that says that you have to be trained to be compliant.
[3:48:07.680 --> 3:48:08.680]  If you're not compliant,
[3:48:08.680 --> 3:48:11.680]  you can't participate in emergency management.
[3:48:11.680 --> 3:48:12.680]  Well, that's what FEMA's all about.
[3:48:12.680 --> 3:48:14.680]  They're reading out all the people.
[3:48:14.680 --> 3:48:15.680]  Yeah, I mean, it's all about control.
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:17.680]  It's all about doing what the elite want to do.
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:19.680]  That's why it's part of the continuity of government program.
[3:48:19.680 --> 3:48:21.680]  In case they just want to declare
[3:48:21.680 --> 3:48:23.680]  that we no longer have a constitutional government
[3:48:23.680 --> 3:48:25.680]  like they did on 9-11,
[3:48:25.680 --> 3:48:27.680]  FEMA will step in and do what it has to do.
[3:48:27.680 --> 3:48:30.680]  That's why they let Halliburton build all those FEMA camps
[3:48:30.680 --> 3:48:32.680]  throughout the country privately with no-bid contracts.
[3:48:32.680 --> 3:48:33.680]  It's because...
[3:48:33.680 --> 3:48:36.680]  Well, look at KBR and how Burton had the contract
[3:48:36.680 --> 3:48:39.680]  to build all embryo cars for the FEMA camps.
[3:48:39.680 --> 3:48:42.680]  The contracts financed by the federal government
[3:48:42.680 --> 3:48:44.680]  and there are several videos available on the internet
[3:48:44.680 --> 3:48:47.680]  about how we have concentration camps in the United States
[3:48:47.680 --> 3:48:48.680]  that are funded by FEMA.
[3:48:48.680 --> 3:48:50.680]  Yeah, and they have all these little portable coffins,
[3:48:50.680 --> 3:48:51.680]  if you will.
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:53.680]  They could probably fit two or three bodies
[3:48:53.680 --> 3:48:54.680]  in these plastic coffins.
[3:48:54.680 --> 3:48:57.680]  It really shows you that FEMA is not out for our best interest
[3:48:57.680 --> 3:49:00.680]  and is really going to be just a roundup service
[3:49:00.680 --> 3:49:02.680]  after the disaster or during martial law.
[3:49:02.680 --> 3:49:03.680]  It's very scary stuff.
[3:49:03.680 --> 3:49:05.680]  I thank you so much for the call, Wade.
[3:49:05.680 --> 3:49:07.680]  I'm glad that you enjoyed Truth Rising.
[3:49:07.680 --> 3:49:09.680]  I hope you burn it and you get it out to as many people
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:10.680]  as possible.
[3:49:10.680 --> 3:49:12.680]  Let's go to Rich in Toronto.
[3:49:12.680 --> 3:49:14.680]  Rich, what's on your mind?
[3:49:14.680 --> 3:49:18.680]  I just wanted to tell people about a new website I made.
[3:49:18.680 --> 3:49:20.680]  It's global911truth.com.
[3:49:20.680 --> 3:49:23.680]  I'm also from TorontoChange.com.
[3:49:23.680 --> 3:49:24.680]  We are Change Toronto.
[3:49:24.680 --> 3:49:25.680]  Excellent.
[3:49:25.680 --> 3:49:27.680]  I just wanted to let people know,
[3:49:27.680 --> 3:49:30.680]  if they're in the Toronto area or even anywhere in Canada,
[3:49:30.680 --> 3:49:34.680]  you've got to watch Unfair Dealing.
[3:49:34.680 --> 3:49:38.680]  That deals with the Toronto 18, the Muslims that they arrested
[3:49:38.680 --> 3:49:40.680]  in 2006.
[3:49:40.680 --> 3:49:44.680]  It's a must-see for any Canadian to see how ceases
[3:49:44.680 --> 3:49:47.680]  did some really dirty dealings there.
[3:49:47.680 --> 3:49:49.680]  Throughout the website, one more time.
[3:49:49.680 --> 3:49:51.680]  It's torontochange.com.
[3:49:51.680 --> 3:49:54.680]  You can check out global911truth.com as well.
[3:49:54.680 --> 3:49:56.680]  Rich, thank you so much for the call.
[3:49:56.680 --> 3:49:58.680]  Let's jump to Mark in California.
[3:49:58.680 --> 3:49:59.680]  Mark, you're with us.
[3:49:59.680 --> 3:50:04.680]  Yeah, hey, Jason, I just wanted to give you a success story
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:06.680]  from someone I work with.
[3:50:06.680 --> 3:50:07.680]  Awesome.
[3:50:07.680 --> 3:50:10.680]  Someone a couple of years ago, about three years ago,
[3:50:10.680 --> 3:50:14.680]  I gave a Alex Jones interview with Stanley Hilton.
[3:50:14.680 --> 3:50:15.680]  I think you remember that one.
[3:50:15.680 --> 3:50:18.680]  Yeah, Stanley Hilton was the former Chief of Staff of Bob Dole,
[3:50:18.680 --> 3:50:20.680]  and we'll talk about that on the other side.
[3:50:20.680 --> 3:50:22.680]  He was one of the first guys to go public
[3:50:22.680 --> 3:50:25.680]  and put out a lawsuit into the criminal activity
[3:50:25.680 --> 3:50:27.680]  of our US government involved in 9-11.
[3:50:27.680 --> 3:50:29.680]  We'll come back to Mark.
[3:50:29.680 --> 3:50:31.680]  Remember, it's Independence Day,
[3:50:31.680 --> 3:51:00.680]  and it is rising over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:51:03.680 --> 3:51:05.680]  Is it Mark an implanted chip?
[3:51:05.680 --> 3:51:06.680]  A tattoo?
[3:51:06.680 --> 3:51:07.680]  The National ID card?
[3:51:07.680 --> 3:51:08.680]  Or 666?
[3:51:08.680 --> 3:51:10.680]  Is the Antichrist a person?
[3:51:10.680 --> 3:51:11.680]  Title?
[3:51:11.680 --> 3:51:12.680]  Or both?
[3:51:12.680 --> 3:51:14.680]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[3:51:14.680 --> 3:51:15.680]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[3:51:15.680 --> 3:51:16.680]  First John states,
[3:51:16.680 --> 3:51:19.680]  the Antichrist is already in the world.
[3:51:19.680 --> 3:51:21.680]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[3:51:21.680 --> 3:51:23.680]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[3:51:23.680 --> 3:51:25.680]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[3:51:25.680 --> 3:51:28.680]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies,
[3:51:28.680 --> 3:51:30.680]  exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its Mark,
[3:51:30.680 --> 3:51:32.680]  right to the Bible says,
[3:51:32.680 --> 3:51:36.680]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771,
[3:51:36.680 --> 3:51:40.680]  or call 888-211-1715.
[3:51:40.680 --> 3:51:44.680]  That's 888-211-1715.
[3:51:44.680 --> 3:51:46.680]  Fuel prices are at an all-time high
[3:51:46.680 --> 3:51:48.680]  with no relief in sight.
[3:51:48.680 --> 3:51:50.680]  Do you feel powerless against the large oil companies?

[3:54:43.680 --> 3:54:45.680]  so that they can make copies and hand those out.
[3:54:45.680 --> 3:54:47.680]  Right now, we're talking to Mark in California
[3:54:47.680 --> 3:54:49.680]  and he was talking about how he led his friend
[3:54:49.680 --> 3:54:51.680]  into the Stanley Hilton situation.
[3:54:51.680 --> 3:54:54.680]  And Stanley Hilton was a former chief of staff
[3:54:54.680 --> 3:54:56.680]  for Bob Dole.
[3:54:56.680 --> 3:54:58.680]  And he questioned the official version of 9-11
[3:54:58.680 --> 3:55:01.680]  almost immediately when on the Alex Jones show,
[3:55:01.680 --> 3:55:03.680]  brought up charges against them,
[3:55:03.680 --> 3:55:05.680]  and they just threw them out of court several times.
[3:55:05.680 --> 3:55:07.680]  Go ahead, Mark.
[3:55:07.680 --> 3:55:10.680]  Yeah, well, Jason, you know, I had what I would perceive
[3:55:10.680 --> 3:55:13.680]  as a normal reaction to hearing the Stanley Hilton interview
[3:55:13.680 --> 3:55:15.680]  on the show.
[3:55:15.680 --> 3:55:18.680]  And I distributed it to a few of my friends.
[3:55:18.680 --> 3:55:21.680]  And one of them was someone I was working with
[3:55:21.680 --> 3:55:23.680]  at the time of the interview.
[3:55:23.680 --> 3:55:26.680]  And subsequently, he went to another job.
[3:55:26.680 --> 3:55:30.680]  And I should say at the time, he told me I was crazy.
[3:55:30.680 --> 3:55:35.680]  I was a nut for, you know, even handing him the audio compact disc.
[3:55:35.680 --> 3:55:39.680]  And so anyway, a couple years go by
[3:55:39.680 --> 3:55:43.680]  and he's recently come back to the company that I work for
[3:55:43.680 --> 3:55:48.680]  and out of nowhere, he starts basically describing to me
[3:55:48.680 --> 3:55:52.680]  a terrorist storm and a couple other internet videos
[3:55:52.680 --> 3:55:55.680]  that he had seen that had changed his perspective
[3:55:55.680 --> 3:56:02.680]  and he had jumped out of the typical left-right mindset
[3:56:02.680 --> 3:56:05.680]  and jumped into our world of,
[3:56:05.680 --> 3:56:09.680]  holy mackerel, there's all kinds of stuff going on
[3:56:09.680 --> 3:56:12.680]  that we're being lied to about.
[3:56:12.680 --> 3:56:20.680]  So I don't know if it was necessarily my giving him the audio CD.
[3:56:20.680 --> 3:56:23.680]  Well, I guarantee that was the start of it, man.
[3:56:23.680 --> 3:56:26.680]  Listen, you plant these seeds. They don't always bloom right away.
[3:56:26.680 --> 3:56:29.680]  Sometimes they do. Some people are smart enough to pick up on it.
[3:56:29.680 --> 3:56:32.680]  Some people are like, oh, my God, and then they want more information.
[3:56:32.680 --> 3:56:35.680]  Well, it sits back in the back of their mind forever.
[3:56:35.680 --> 3:56:37.680]  And then all of a sudden there's a trigger.
[3:56:37.680 --> 3:56:39.680]  And that's why I don't give up on my friends and their family.
[3:56:39.680 --> 3:56:41.680]  That's why I've been pushing this stuff even when I go home.
[3:56:41.680 --> 3:56:45.680]  That's why I gave, you know, my Republican friend who got married in New York last week,
[3:56:45.680 --> 3:56:49.680]  you know, 12 different movies including, you know, Alex Jones's movies,
[3:56:49.680 --> 3:56:52.680]  My Movies, American Drug War, because we can wake them up.
[3:56:52.680 --> 3:56:55.680]  We can keep pushing. They're not going to call us nuts forever.
[3:56:55.680 --> 3:56:59.680]  Something's going to happen in their life that's going to trigger them to this information.
[3:56:59.680 --> 3:57:01.680]  They're going to join our fight. I truly believe that.
[3:57:01.680 --> 3:57:07.680]  Seems to me that the 9-1-1 truth rising, which I've watched three times already,
[3:57:07.680 --> 3:57:14.680]  shows the other side doing just a series of ad hominem attacks against people
[3:57:14.680 --> 3:57:21.680]  that are simply basically quoting stories that they've seen in the mainstream press.
[3:57:21.680 --> 3:57:25.680]  And, you know, it seems like they always get back on their heels
[3:57:25.680 --> 3:57:30.680]  and they just resort to name calling or saying, you know,
[3:57:30.680 --> 3:57:32.680]  get a life.
[3:57:32.680 --> 3:57:35.680]  Oh, absolutely. Well, let's go through some of the talking points there in the movie.
[3:57:35.680 --> 3:57:37.680]  Oh, they're not going to be nice forever.
[3:57:37.680 --> 3:57:40.680]  What's going to stop them from being tased? They're terrorists.
[3:57:40.680 --> 3:57:42.680]  But in actuality, we're the patriots.
[3:57:42.680 --> 3:57:44.680]  And I'm glad you've watched it almost three times, man.
[3:57:44.680 --> 3:57:47.680]  That's very encouraging. That tells me that this is a good movie.
[3:57:47.680 --> 3:57:49.680]  I hope that you make copies and you hand them out.
[3:57:49.680 --> 3:57:51.680]  I thank you for the call, Mark.
[3:57:51.680 --> 3:57:53.680]  Guys, this is the Alex Jones show.
[3:57:53.680 --> 3:57:56.680]  This is where patriotism is every day.
[3:57:56.680 --> 3:58:00.680]  In fact, it's Independence Day on this show 365 days a year.
[3:58:00.680 --> 3:58:06.680]  If you missed any of this big time broadcast, remember prisonplanet.tv,

[3:58:34.680 --> 3:58:39.680]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[3:58:39.680 --> 3:58:42.680]  I went to grounds here and we knew what to do.
[3:58:42.680 --> 3:58:44.680]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:58:44.680 --> 3:58:47.680]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-Eleven film
[3:58:47.680 --> 3:58:51.680]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:58:51.680 --> 3:59:00.680]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:59:00.680 --> 3:59:03.680]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-Eleven Truth
[3:59:03.680 --> 3:59:07.680]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:59:07.680 --> 3:59:10.680]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:59:10.680 --> 3:59:16.680]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:59:16.680 --> 3:59:19.680]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[3:59:19.680 --> 3:59:25.680]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[3:59:28.680 --> 3:59:30.680]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[3:59:30.680 --> 3:59:34.680]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:59:34.680 --> 3:59:41.680]  Thank you for listening to Jucius.
