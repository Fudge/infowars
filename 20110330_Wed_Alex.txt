[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:40.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.680]  welcome my friends welcome and thank you so much for joining us it is Wednesday the
[00:45.680 --> 00:50.920]  30th day of March 2011 we're gonna be live here for at least the next three
[00:50.920 --> 00:56.120]  hours we have Gerald Salente joining us on the news yesterday that areas that
[00:56.120 --> 01:01.200]  were previously seen as immune to housing prices dropping has actually
[01:01.200 --> 01:06.000]  accelerated in their drop and that is pulling down the rest of the housing
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.400]  market across the United States all other major commodities of course are
[01:11.400 --> 01:16.720]  increasing in price right now due to global dollar devaluation dr. Paul Craig
[01:16.720 --> 01:21.560]  Roberts will join us in the last 30 minutes of the third hour he's got a
[01:21.560 --> 01:26.200]  new article out today at info wars dot com titled Obama takes American
[01:26.200 --> 01:32.320]  hypocrisy to new levels dealing with the situation in Libya and we also have Levi
[01:32.320 --> 01:38.120]  Smith who runs a tattoo parlor in Phoenix Arizona more and more across the
[01:38.120 --> 01:42.760]  country they're getting digital barcode tattoos so people can access them with
[01:42.760 --> 01:46.000]  their smartphones and purchase things with them and they just think it's
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.080]  absolutely wonderful and so we're gonna be talking to Levi Smith coming up in
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.320]  30 minutes for just one segment or so here's the big news and it's really not
[01:58.320 --> 02:03.800]  new news to our audience but it confirms what we said two weeks ago or more than
[02:03.800 --> 02:07.760]  two weeks ago now on that Monday three days after the disaster began on the
[02:07.760 --> 02:14.680]  11th of March that Fukushima number one two and three were in critical
[02:14.680 --> 02:20.240]  situation later in that week they admitted that the reactor cores have
[02:20.240 --> 02:25.880]  been breached at least two of the stricken earthquake tsunami ravaged
[02:25.880 --> 02:32.120]  reactors at the Fukushima six reactor facility and these are the headlines
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.880]  Fukushima nuke plant now in full meltdown it's melted as Japanese
[02:36.880 --> 02:41.560]  government admits completely through the containment steel container through the
[02:41.560 --> 02:46.520]  concrete and is now below the facility and boiling through the water table and
[02:46.520 --> 02:52.280]  sending out record levels of radiation is the reports Fukushima nuke plant now
[02:52.280 --> 02:57.280]  in full meltdown reactor number two we've already seen partial Chernobyl
[02:57.280 --> 03:01.360]  explosions in the aggregate dwarfing Chernobyl according to many top
[03:01.360 --> 03:06.200]  radiation experts and nuclear physicist but now we have the Leningradian
[03:06.200 --> 03:10.640]  headline that Japan may have lost the race to save nuclear reactor may have
[03:10.640 --> 03:17.160]  lost they admit it's melted down through the vessel and it could explode not not
[03:17.160 --> 03:21.680]  in an atomic explosion some physicists argue that they could but in a
[03:21.680 --> 03:26.240]  Chernobyl off-gassing of incredible levels of uranium and other isotopes
[03:26.240 --> 03:30.560]  here's Mike Adams report on it Fukushima beyond point of no return as
[03:30.560 --> 03:35.640]  radioactive core melts through containment vessel business insider Fukushima
[03:35.640 --> 03:39.960]  record high levels of radioactive iodine detected in the ocean nearby
[03:39.960 --> 03:44.840]  concentrations 3,355 times the legal limit was identified in seawater
[03:44.840 --> 03:49.080]  sample near the plant Japan's nuclear safety agency said today this is the
[03:49.080 --> 03:53.400]  highest contamination yet of the radioactive iodine and of course they've
[03:53.400 --> 03:57.840]  been reporting since sunday now four days ago 100,000 times safe levels near
[03:57.840 --> 04:03.040]  the plant of uranium and plutonium continuing here
[04:03.040 --> 04:10.080]  sysium fallout from Fukushima already rivals Chernobyl and this boil down
[04:10.080 --> 04:16.840]  blog has links to new scientist you name it so all breaking that down for you
[04:16.840 --> 04:22.120]  we'll be getting into more details after the break just amazing hoax going on as
[04:22.120 --> 04:26.360]  well I shot a video last night that's going to be out later today dealing with
[04:26.360 --> 04:30.120]  the fact that it's a hundred percent public that al-qaeda does work for the
[04:30.120 --> 04:35.000]  military industrial complex but the media is now saying that Amar al-Laki the
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.880]  head of al-qaeda is praising what's happening in Libyan other areas well of
[04:39.880 --> 04:43.600]  course he's praising it he works for the Pentagon hangs out there continually
[04:43.600 --> 04:49.960]  they have Fox News headline Amar al-Laki meeting secretly at the Pentagon so all
[04:49.960 --> 04:54.520]  of that is going on US NATO commander admits that al-qaeda is the Red Bull
[04:54.520 --> 04:58.600]  forces it's all coming up stay with us
[04:59.600 --> 05:07.240]  when you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but
[05:07.240 --> 05:11.840]  if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets
[05:11.840 --> 05:21.080]  there's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans they
[05:21.080 --> 05:28.640]  so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit
[05:28.640 --> 05:35.080]  they put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most blue diamond

[05:59.960 --> 06:03.320]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[06:03.320 --> 06:07.240]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[06:07.240 --> 06:11.520]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[06:11.520 --> 06:15.800]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[06:15.800 --> 06:20.160]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[06:20.160 --> 06:24.280]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.280 --> 06:28.760]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:28.760 --> 06:32.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:32.920 --> 06:36.880]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:36.880 --> 06:40.720]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:40.720 --> 06:43.440]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[06:43.440 --> 06:49.440]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[07:59.520 --> 08:03.520]  one one two three
[08:03.520 --> 08:31.520]  when I was young I was the nicest guy I thought I was the chosen one
[08:31.520 --> 08:38.520]  the time went by and I found out a thing or two
[08:38.520 --> 08:45.520]  I shined when our first time went wrong
[08:45.520 --> 08:52.520]  I thought that I was living out the perfect life
[08:52.520 --> 08:59.520]  but in the lonely hours when the truth begins to light
[08:59.520 --> 09:05.520]  I thought about the times when I turned my back and started
[09:05.520 --> 09:12.520]  I ain't no nice guy after all
[09:12.520 --> 09:19.520]  when I was young I was the only gay in time
[09:19.520 --> 09:26.520]  I thought I had it down for sure
[09:26.520 --> 09:33.520]  the time went by and I was lost in what I found
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.520]  the reasons blurred the way I'm sure
[09:38.520 --> 09:41.520]  thank you for joining us my friends
[09:41.520 --> 09:47.520]  it is Wednesday the 30th day of March 2011
[09:47.520 --> 09:50.520]  and we do have Gerald Salente joining us
[09:50.520 --> 09:53.520]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts former head of policy at the Treasury
[09:53.520 --> 09:56.520]  to cover the news coming out yesterday and today
[09:56.520 --> 10:05.520]  of record housing price drops this time in areas that were seen as invulnerable
[10:05.520 --> 10:11.520]  and basically immune from housing price drops
[10:11.520 --> 10:18.520]  and that also follows general increases in housing prices decreasing
[10:18.520 --> 10:24.520]  also consumer confidence is being registered as the lowest in modern history
[10:24.520 --> 10:28.520]  but the government and the media the dominant dinosaur media
[10:28.520 --> 10:32.520]  that's less and less dominant are busy telling us that the economy is back
[10:32.520 --> 10:38.520]  and is great and I last night watching CNBC actually saw them on there saying
[10:38.520 --> 10:40.520]  it's no big deal of oil prices go up
[10:40.520 --> 10:43.520]  that's just something else being purchased in the economy
[10:43.520 --> 10:46.520]  and that that will go to American businesses
[10:46.520 --> 10:48.520]  and a lot of other companies
[10:48.520 --> 10:55.520]  and the big oil companies the OPEC made over a trillion dollars last year
[10:55.520 --> 10:59.520]  that was the headline in Reuters yesterday
[10:59.520 --> 11:02.520]  so that is some of what we're going to be breaking down
[11:02.520 --> 11:06.520]  coming up at the bottom of the hour we have a tattoo shop owner
[11:06.520 --> 11:11.520]  who put special barcode high-tech barcode tattoos on people
[11:11.520 --> 11:15.520]  so they can buy and sell with a wave of their hand
[11:15.520 --> 11:17.520]  or it's on their forearm a wave of their forearm
[11:17.520 --> 11:20.520]  or on their face purchasing with it
[11:20.520 --> 11:23.520]  and it's the coolest, trendiest thing to do
[11:23.520 --> 11:26.520]  next I guess jumping off cliffs will be the coolest and trendiest thing to do
[11:26.520 --> 11:29.520]  according to Ann Coulter
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.520]  the people of Fukushima should be thankful they'll never get cancer now
[11:33.520 --> 11:35.520]  this is a cancer cure
[11:35.520 --> 11:38.520]  of course the Japanese government admits that five hours around the plant
[11:38.520 --> 11:40.520]  will give you 5,000 milliseverts
[11:40.520 --> 11:43.520]  that kills roughly statistically half the people
[11:43.520 --> 11:46.520]  that come in contact with it within just a week or two
[11:46.520 --> 11:50.520]  and that was reported on the Washington Post yesterday
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.520]  and they now have 100,000 times safe levels of radiation
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.520]  3,000 plus times the legal level of radioactive iodine
[11:58.520 --> 12:00.520]  now in the ocean nearby
[12:00.520 --> 12:04.520]  and one of the main reactors has now gone through total meltdown
[12:04.520 --> 12:08.520]  and melted through the steel container
[12:08.520 --> 12:12.520]  through the floor and into the aquifer beneath it
[12:12.520 --> 12:15.520]  and it's just absolutely horrible news
[12:15.520 --> 12:18.520]  but it doesn't matter because like Carl Rove says
[12:18.520 --> 12:21.520]  the government and the media they believe they control reality
[12:21.520 --> 12:24.520]  and they call those of us that know the truth the reality based community
[12:24.520 --> 12:26.520]  I read those quotes
[12:26.520 --> 12:28.520]  but they are creating an unreality
[12:28.520 --> 12:30.520]  and as Joseph Goebbels said
[12:30.520 --> 12:33.520]  good propaganda isn't sophisticated
[12:33.520 --> 12:35.520]  it's simple
[12:35.520 --> 12:39.520]  and it talks to people's laziness
[12:39.520 --> 12:43.520]  they're inherent wish to just rationalize
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.520]  and obfuscate and procrastinate
[12:48.520 --> 12:50.520]  and deny that something's bad
[12:50.520 --> 12:53.520]  and radiation detectors now
[12:53.520 --> 12:56.520]  as far away as Russia have now picked up radiation
[12:56.520 --> 12:58.520]  that's now pretty much circled the globe
[12:58.520 --> 13:00.520]  and another week or so it's estimated that it will
[13:00.520 --> 13:02.520]  have circled the entire globe
[13:02.520 --> 13:05.520]  and the stuff released 18, 19 days ago
[13:05.520 --> 13:10.520]  on the 11th of March
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.520]  it's now the 30th we'll be over Tokyo once again
[13:15.520 --> 13:17.520]  so we'll go all the way around the world
[13:17.520 --> 13:20.520]  of course it's first stop is Japan and then the Pacific Ocean
[13:20.520 --> 13:22.520]  and then North America
[13:22.520 --> 13:24.520]  and according to the media
[13:24.520 --> 13:26.520]  according to the Japanese government for the first two weeks
[13:26.520 --> 13:28.520]  they kept school in nearby
[13:28.520 --> 13:31.520]  they are telling the people
[13:31.520 --> 13:34.520]  go ahead and drink the water it's fine everything's great
[13:34.520 --> 13:36.520]  and now they're saying actually we covered up
[13:36.520 --> 13:38.520]  don't drink the water don't eat the food
[13:38.520 --> 13:40.520]  and the food's running out
[13:40.520 --> 13:42.520]  the bottle water ran out a week ago
[13:42.520 --> 13:46.520]  and all of that is continuing to unfold
[13:46.520 --> 13:48.520]  and we'll be talking about this
[13:48.520 --> 13:50.520]  off and on throughout the broadcast with Gerald Salente
[13:50.520 --> 13:53.520]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others
[13:53.520 --> 13:55.520]  but the average trendy in America
[13:55.520 --> 13:57.520]  is not really worried about it
[13:57.520 --> 13:59.520]  they're wanting to get the newest barcode tattoo
[13:59.520 --> 14:02.520]  and in this newscast we're going to play in the next segment
[14:02.520 --> 14:04.520]  the young woman laying there getting the tattoo says
[14:04.520 --> 14:07.520]  it's mine only I have this tattoo
[14:07.520 --> 14:09.520]  it's mine
[14:09.520 --> 14:12.520]  I mean just talk about a lamb to the slaughter
[14:12.520 --> 14:14.520]  there's no idea about history
[14:14.520 --> 14:17.520]  about the IBM barcode
[14:17.520 --> 14:19.520]  numbers entered into the whole earth
[14:19.520 --> 14:21.520]  IBM machines where Hitler
[14:21.520 --> 14:23.520]  tracked the people on the slave camps
[14:23.520 --> 14:26.520]  to decide how much to feed them how much to work them
[14:26.520 --> 14:28.520]  and to keep track of them and then the computer would tell them
[14:28.520 --> 14:30.520]  when to go ahead and walk them outside
[14:30.520 --> 14:32.520]  the bullet in the back of their head
[14:32.520 --> 14:34.520]  see I'm not against technology
[14:34.520 --> 14:36.520]  but the globalist
[14:36.520 --> 14:38.520]  because it's just a neutral capacity
[14:38.520 --> 14:40.520]  the globalist are setting up
[14:40.520 --> 14:42.520]  a infrastructure in their own words
[14:42.520 --> 14:44.520]  of total control, total surveillance
[14:44.520 --> 14:46.520]  a boot stomping on the human face
[14:46.520 --> 14:48.520]  forever
[14:48.520 --> 14:50.520]  you see George Arwell
[14:50.520 --> 14:52.520]  true name Eric Blair came from a
[14:52.520 --> 14:55.520]  somewhat aristocratic intelligentsia family
[14:55.520 --> 14:57.520]  and he worked in the imperial police
[14:57.520 --> 14:59.520]  right out of high school
[14:59.520 --> 15:01.520]  in India
[15:01.520 --> 15:03.520]  helping carry out executions
[15:03.520 --> 15:05.520]  and things of that nature and roundups
[15:05.520 --> 15:07.520]  of the Indians who were rebelling
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.520]  then he rebelled against that and the imperial
[15:09.520 --> 15:11.520]  went and joined the communist
[15:11.520 --> 15:13.520]  and fought and was shot through the throat
[15:13.520 --> 15:15.520]  and survived in the Spanish Civil War
[15:15.520 --> 15:17.520]  and
[15:17.520 --> 15:19.520]  then he found out the communists
[15:19.520 --> 15:21.520]  were controlled by the same banking cartel
[15:21.520 --> 15:23.520]  and so he ran off
[15:23.520 --> 15:25.520]  but then Hitler popped up
[15:25.520 --> 15:27.520]  and so he worked in the BBC
[15:27.520 --> 15:29.520]  and this character is Winston Smith
[15:29.520 --> 15:31.520]  who works in the Ministry of Truth
[15:31.520 --> 15:33.520]  that puts out lies
[15:33.520 --> 15:35.520]  the big brother media brainwashing center
[15:35.520 --> 15:37.520]  where one day they're at war with East Asia
[15:37.520 --> 15:39.520]  the next day they've never been at war with East Asia
[15:39.520 --> 15:41.520]  the next day they're back at war
[15:41.520 --> 15:43.520]  and have always been at war
[15:43.520 --> 15:45.520]  and if you say hey that's a lie
[15:45.520 --> 15:47.520]  you're taken away and tortured until you confess
[15:47.520 --> 15:49.520]  just because they like to torture
[15:49.520 --> 15:51.520]  and they explain that we can just kill you
[15:51.520 --> 15:53.520]  but we like to torture you
[15:53.520 --> 15:55.520]  it's because we enjoy it Winston
[15:55.520 --> 15:57.520]  because we control reality
[15:57.520 --> 15:59.520]  2 plus 2 could equal 3, 10, 100
[15:59.520 --> 16:01.520]  Winston there is no answer
[16:01.520 --> 16:03.520]  so Winston says just tell me what number you want to say
[16:03.520 --> 16:05.520]  and he said Winston I want you to just see all numbers
[16:05.520 --> 16:07.520]  you see
[16:07.520 --> 16:09.520]  we control reality now
[16:09.520 --> 16:11.520]  Winston and you people in the reality based community
[16:11.520 --> 16:13.520]  we're going to stomp you out
[16:13.520 --> 16:15.520]  and get rid of you
[16:15.520 --> 16:17.520]  so see Orwell had experienced
[16:17.520 --> 16:19.520]  working for imperial police
[16:19.520 --> 16:21.520]  working for the communists
[16:21.520 --> 16:23.520]  then working for BBC propaganda
[16:23.520 --> 16:25.520]  discovered that it was the state
[16:25.520 --> 16:27.520]  and the control freak psychopathic
[16:27.520 --> 16:29.520]  priest of power as he called them
[16:29.520 --> 16:31.520]  pressing on the nerve of power always
[16:31.520 --> 16:33.520]  Winston as O'Brien tells him
[16:33.520 --> 16:35.520]  as he lovingly rips his teeth out
[16:35.520 --> 16:37.520]  after torturing him for months
[16:37.520 --> 16:39.520]  he explains to Winston
[16:39.520 --> 16:41.520]  that it's all about a psychopath
[16:41.520 --> 16:43.520]  dream world
[16:43.520 --> 16:45.520]  it's all about a giant
[16:45.520 --> 16:47.520]  carnival
[16:47.520 --> 16:49.520]  of enjoyment
[16:49.520 --> 16:51.520]  and about strata a pyramidal structure
[16:51.520 --> 16:53.520]  of psychopaths and sadists
[16:53.520 --> 16:55.520]  and control freaks from the top
[16:55.520 --> 16:57.520]  all the way down to the bottom
[16:57.520 --> 16:59.520]  with gibbering mindless prols
[16:59.520 --> 17:01.520]  obsessed with the lottery
[17:01.520 --> 17:03.520]  and gambling and sports
[17:03.520 --> 17:05.520]  and their tattoos
[17:05.520 --> 17:07.520]  and I'm not judging you if you have a tattoo
[17:07.520 --> 17:09.520]  some of it's interesting art that's your style great
[17:09.520 --> 17:11.520]  it's just that these are things
[17:11.520 --> 17:13.520]  in cultures that are always
[17:13.520 --> 17:15.520]  markers of decline
[17:15.520 --> 17:17.520]  self mutilation
[17:17.520 --> 17:19.520]  men who can't ever be serious
[17:19.520 --> 17:21.520]  and just gibber and joke
[17:21.520 --> 17:23.520]  hour after hour day after day
[17:23.520 --> 17:25.520]  it's a sophomoric frozen state
[17:25.520 --> 17:27.520]  because men
[17:27.520 --> 17:29.520]  who feel
[17:29.520 --> 17:31.520]  like they're alpha males and that they should
[17:31.520 --> 17:33.520]  be dominant get suppressed
[17:33.520 --> 17:35.520]  by the system because from birth
[17:35.520 --> 17:37.520]  they're set in front of the television set same thing with women
[17:37.520 --> 17:39.520]  they're taught how to be mindless tarts
[17:39.520 --> 17:41.520]  and
[17:41.520 --> 17:43.520]  are fed a false reality
[17:43.520 --> 17:45.520]  that gives them no pass to true
[17:45.520 --> 17:47.520]  to true personal power
[17:47.520 --> 17:49.520]  that every male seeks
[17:49.520 --> 17:51.520]  at a primitive subconscious level
[17:51.520 --> 17:53.520]  to protect his mate and his children
[17:53.520 --> 17:55.520]  I mean the
[17:55.520 --> 17:57.520]  seeking for security and strength
[17:57.520 --> 17:59.520]  and power is a male attribute
[17:59.520 --> 18:01.520]  but because it's
[18:01.520 --> 18:03.520]  denied to men unless they become a police officer
[18:03.520 --> 18:05.520]  then they're twisted and only used
[18:05.520 --> 18:07.520]  against the general public or the military
[18:07.520 --> 18:09.520]  is one of the few venues where you can
[18:09.520 --> 18:11.520]  supposedly be a warrior male
[18:11.520 --> 18:13.520]  but you suborn yourself to a corporate
[18:13.520 --> 18:15.520]  structure and then are dehumanized
[18:15.520 --> 18:17.520]  and used like trash
[18:17.520 --> 18:19.520]  because it's run by psychopaths there is no
[18:19.520 --> 18:21.520]  honor
[18:21.520 --> 18:23.520]  and this is what the globalist
[18:23.520 --> 18:25.520]  have done you know it's been said about many
[18:25.520 --> 18:27.520]  third world countries the more enslaved
[18:27.520 --> 18:29.520]  the more childlike the population
[18:29.520 --> 18:31.520]  is and the
[18:31.520 --> 18:33.520]  elites in Mexico
[18:33.520 --> 18:35.520]  refer to the population as the dumb children
[18:35.520 --> 18:37.520]  and the elites here
[18:37.520 --> 18:39.520]  refer to us as idiots
[18:39.520 --> 18:41.520]  what did Carl Rove tell the New York Times
[18:41.520 --> 18:43.520]  and Washington Post reporters in the interview
[18:43.520 --> 18:45.520]  back in
[18:45.520 --> 18:47.520]  2004 he said
[18:47.520 --> 18:49.520]  we're history's actors we of course
[18:49.520 --> 18:51.520]  know it's a false reality we will change
[18:51.520 --> 18:53.520]  reality day by day you will study
[18:53.520 --> 18:55.520]  whatever we tell you and you will put out
[18:55.520 --> 18:57.520]  that propaganda through peer pressure you
[18:57.520 --> 18:59.520]  don't exist you're a vassal you're
[18:59.520 --> 19:01.520]  a slave how do you like it
[19:03.520 --> 19:05.520]  and the reporters by and large said
[19:05.520 --> 19:07.520]  man this is bizarre but it's true
[19:07.520 --> 19:09.520]  and we have decided to serve you
[19:09.520 --> 19:11.520]  and the media and the government said good
[19:11.520 --> 19:13.520]  you have chosen
[19:13.520 --> 19:15.520]  like Winston Smith
[19:15.520 --> 19:17.520]  who was tortured to not be able to tell
[19:17.520 --> 19:19.520]  2 plus 2 equals 4 anymore
[19:19.520 --> 19:21.520]  when he said 2 plus 2 the ability to say 2
[19:21.520 --> 19:23.520]  plus 2 equals 4 is freedom
[19:23.520 --> 19:25.520]  it's victory and it is
[19:25.520 --> 19:27.520]  if you can say 2 plus 2 equals 4
[19:27.520 --> 19:29.520]  you have total victory
[19:29.520 --> 19:31.520]  now through that let me
[19:31.520 --> 19:33.520]  explain and we're all a lucky is in the news
[19:33.520 --> 19:35.520]  admitted US government agent
[19:35.520 --> 19:37.520]  100% publicly
[19:37.520 --> 19:39.520]  AP Fox years of it runs all
[19:39.520 --> 19:41.520]  the attacks totally staged he's in the
[19:41.520 --> 19:43.520]  news saying that he's for the attacks
[19:43.520 --> 19:45.520]  in Libya and it's also
[19:45.520 --> 19:47.520]  in the news NATO admits yes we're working
[19:47.520 --> 19:49.520]  with al-qaeda they're good guys
[19:49.520 --> 19:51.520]  now somebody who can say 2 plus 2
[19:51.520 --> 19:53.520]  equals 4 says well this is treason
[19:53.520 --> 19:55.520]  our government always ran al-qaeda but see the
[19:55.520 --> 19:57.520]  general yuppie will say no I understand al-qaeda
[19:57.520 --> 20:11.520]  is good and they're bad

[21:03.520 --> 21:05.520]  this is our last chance
[21:05.520 --> 21:07.520]  to not relive history as we're
[21:07.520 --> 21:09.520]  finishing off this agenda
[21:09.520 --> 21:11.520]  that we're pulling the rug from
[21:11.520 --> 21:13.520]  underneath the Americans at home
[21:13.520 --> 21:15.520]  I've turned in this influence on our

[21:17.520 --> 21:19.520]  are calling the shots I think it's
[21:19.520 --> 21:21.520]  incumbent upon all of us
[21:21.520 --> 21:23.520]  as American citizens to pay

[23:39.520 --> 23:41.520]  correct when stating a central bank issuing
[23:41.520 --> 23:43.520]  the public currency is a greater menace to the
[23:43.520 --> 23:45.520]  liberties of the people than a standing army
[23:45.520 --> 23:47.520]  hi Ted anderson I'm placing a silver dollar in a
[23:47.520 --> 23:49.520]  book explains our monetary system
[23:49.520 --> 23:51.520]  call for your copy 800 686 2237
[23:51.520 --> 23:53.520]  it's time to understand the system call
[23:53.520 --> 23:55.520]  800 686 2237 that's
[23:55.520 --> 23:57.520]  800 686 2237
[24:07.520 --> 24:09.520]  you see they want you domesticated they want
[24:09.520 --> 24:11.520]  you dumbed down they don't want you to have a
[24:11.520 --> 24:13.520]  fighting spirit an instinct
[24:13.520 --> 24:15.520]  to stand up for yourself
[24:15.520 --> 24:17.520]  to stand up for your family
[24:17.520 --> 24:19.520]  you know if you catch some baby raccoons
[24:19.520 --> 24:21.520]  in your
[24:21.520 --> 24:23.520]  fishing cabin and they're in there digging
[24:23.520 --> 24:25.520]  around in your cupboard and you run in
[24:25.520 --> 24:27.520]  and start trying to swat them with a broom
[24:27.520 --> 24:29.520]  mama if she's around will attack you
[24:29.520 --> 24:31.520]  but see
[24:31.520 --> 24:33.520]  humans have always been like that but now
[24:33.520 --> 24:35.520]  when the CPS comes to take your kids people
[24:35.520 --> 24:37.520]  just give them up to them
[24:37.520 --> 24:39.520]  or in the IRS comes to take your house
[24:39.520 --> 24:41.520]  for the Federal Reserve people don't even resist
[24:41.520 --> 24:43.520]  in fact they just fall down
[24:43.520 --> 24:45.520]  and cry and so we've been
[24:45.520 --> 24:47.520]  domesticated like domesticated
[24:47.520 --> 24:49.520]  animals so that we're more easily sucked
[24:49.520 --> 24:51.520]  off of and slaughtered
[24:51.520 --> 24:53.520]  intellectually and physically
[24:53.520 --> 24:55.520]  so when I say the ability
[24:55.520 --> 24:57.520]  to be free is two plus two equals
[24:57.520 --> 24:59.520]  four
[24:59.520 --> 25:01.520]  when it's on Fox News
[25:01.520 --> 25:03.520]  and Associated Press then Amaral
[25:03.520 --> 25:05.520]  Alaki who runs all the major terror attacks
[25:05.520 --> 25:07.520]  in the west
[25:07.520 --> 25:09.520]  is secretly hanging out at the Pentagon
[25:09.520 --> 25:11.520]  while he's on the most wanted list
[25:11.520 --> 25:13.520]  and we'll put that up on screen
[25:13.520 --> 25:15.520]  from Fox News
[25:15.520 --> 25:17.520]  there it is exclusive
[25:17.520 --> 25:19.520]  Fox News Al-Qaeda leader dying at the Pentagon
[25:19.520 --> 25:21.520]  just months after 9-11
[25:21.520 --> 25:23.520]  or the Times of London
[25:23.520 --> 25:25.520]  or Newsweek reporting
[25:25.520 --> 25:27.520]  nine years ago that the top Taliban
[25:27.520 --> 25:29.520]  and Al-Qaeda were captured and then
[25:29.520 --> 25:31.520]  the military was ordered to fly them out
[25:31.520 --> 25:33.520]  to safety just search airlift of evil
[25:33.520 --> 25:35.520]  and they were like why don't we let them go
[25:35.520 --> 25:37.520]  and then give them gold because they've done a good job
[25:37.520 --> 25:39.520]  they stage as the fake enemy
[25:39.520 --> 25:41.520]  the decoys as the excuse to take over
[25:41.520 --> 25:43.520]  Afghanistan and the opium 500 billion a year
[25:43.520 --> 25:45.520]  90 plus percent of world
[25:45.520 --> 25:47.520]  opium production with 92 percent
[25:47.520 --> 25:49.520]  and then they're flown out to safety
[25:49.520 --> 25:51.520]  and then they're moved into Pakistan
[25:51.520 --> 25:53.520]  and then the globalists can start then bombing
[25:53.520 --> 25:55.520]  that country and then they're moved
[25:55.520 --> 25:57.520]  into Libya and then it's called heroes
[25:57.520 --> 25:59.520]  and US and British special forces
[25:59.520 --> 26:01.520]  now we learned, confirmed
[26:01.520 --> 26:03.520]  six weeks ago begin leading Al-Qaeda
[26:03.520 --> 26:05.520]  in an attack but separately
[26:05.520 --> 26:07.520]  Reuters comes out and says
[26:07.520 --> 26:09.520]  and we're all Alaki in an article published
[26:09.520 --> 26:11.520]  yesterday if you can even believe this
[26:11.520 --> 26:13.520]  said the removal of his anti-Islamist
[26:13.520 --> 26:15.520]  autocrats like Qaddafi
[26:15.520 --> 26:17.520]  men Islamic fighters and scholars
[26:17.520 --> 26:19.520]  were now freer to discuss and organize
[26:19.520 --> 26:21.520]  and he praised what's happening in Tunisia
[26:21.520 --> 26:23.520]  Egypt, Libya
[26:23.520 --> 26:25.520]  now this is a known
[26:25.520 --> 26:27.520]  this guy the media now reported
[26:27.520 --> 26:29.520]  is bigger than
[26:29.520 --> 26:31.520]  bin Laden he had been his number two they now see bin Laden
[26:31.520 --> 26:33.520]  who we know died a long time ago
[26:33.520 --> 26:35.520]  well he's gone as the boogeyman it's and we're all Alaki
[26:35.520 --> 26:37.520]  who publicly works for the Pentagon
[26:39.520 --> 26:41.520]  publicly and and and I was
[26:41.520 --> 26:43.520]  on man cow this morning who never could believe
[26:43.520 --> 26:45.520]  as he said I guess you're right on air
[26:45.520 --> 26:47.520]  on close to a hundred big stations
[26:47.520 --> 26:49.520]  he said I guess you're right it's true Al-Qaeda
[26:49.520 --> 26:51.520]  does work for the Pentagon see
[26:51.520 --> 26:53.520]  man cow Eric
[26:53.520 --> 26:55.520]  man cow Mueller finally could
[26:55.520 --> 26:57.520]  say two plus two equals four
[26:57.520 --> 26:59.520]  he could finally do it now
[26:59.520 --> 27:01.520]  can you do it because all I'm
[27:01.520 --> 27:03.520]  pointing out is here he's publicly works
[27:03.520 --> 27:05.520]  for the Pentagon trained in the U.S.
[27:05.520 --> 27:07.520]  head CIA officer
[27:07.520 --> 27:09.520]  trained for decades here sent in
[27:09.520 --> 27:11.520]  turns out leading the rebels
[27:11.520 --> 27:13.520]  head of NATO admits Al-Qaeda is the core
[27:13.520 --> 27:15.520]  doesn't mean there aren't other Libyans who joined
[27:15.520 --> 27:17.520]  in and who don't like Qaddafi
[27:17.520 --> 27:19.520]  the fact is we're being told Al-Qaeda is the good guys
[27:21.520 --> 27:23.520]  we're gonna talk more about this later
[27:23.520 --> 27:25.520]  with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and others
[27:25.520 --> 27:27.520]  but I mean there it is can you
[27:27.520 --> 27:29.520]  say two plus two equals four or are you
[27:29.520 --> 27:31.520]  like the general public like Winston Smith being tortured
[27:31.520 --> 27:33.520]  in 1984 who just says I don't know
[27:33.520 --> 27:35.520]  I can't understand it you
[27:35.520 --> 27:37.520]  can't understand something that two plus two equals four
[27:37.520 --> 27:39.520]  now we're gonna come back
[27:39.520 --> 27:41.520]  and go to tattoo artist Levi Smith
[27:41.520 --> 27:43.520]  of Jade Monkey tattoo in Phoenix
[27:43.520 --> 27:45.520]  I think he's the owner but first
[27:45.520 --> 27:47.520]  I want to play a few minutes of
[27:47.520 --> 27:49.520]  these new digital tattoos that are so
[27:49.520 --> 27:51.520]  cool everybody's got to
[27:51.520 --> 27:53.520]  get them to buy and sell with a mark
[27:53.520 --> 27:55.520]  on your body here it is
[27:55.520 --> 27:57.520]  it's reality the idea
[27:57.520 --> 27:59.520]  of having barcodes with personal
[27:59.520 --> 28:01.520]  information tattooed
[28:01.520 --> 28:03.520]  on your body it is here take a look at this
[28:03.520 --> 28:05.520]  a tattoo artist in Phoenix
[28:05.520 --> 28:07.520]  is offering to give QR code
[28:07.520 --> 28:09.520]  tattoos now QR stands for
[28:09.520 --> 28:11.520]  quick response and
[28:11.520 --> 28:13.520]  when you take a photo of the code on your
[28:13.520 --> 28:15.520]  phone it can take you right to
[28:15.520 --> 28:17.520]  the person's Facebook website
[28:17.520 --> 28:19.520]  and get their personal information
[28:21.520 --> 28:23.520]  it's something different that nobody else
[28:23.520 --> 28:25.520]  will have it's my tattoo
[28:25.520 --> 28:27.520]  and no one else can have it
[28:27.520 --> 28:29.520]  and as far as we know Levi Smith
[28:29.520 --> 28:31.520]  at Jade Monkey tattoo in Phoenix is the
[28:31.520 --> 28:33.520]  only shop offering the tattoos and this
[28:33.520 --> 28:35.520]  morning we have Levi with us thank you very
[28:35.520 --> 28:37.520]  much okay we're gonna come back
[28:37.520 --> 28:39.520]  we're gonna come back and talk to Levi but you see that poor
[28:39.520 --> 28:41.520]  uh Jones girl
[28:41.520 --> 28:43.520]  man that that that shames the name
[28:43.520 --> 28:45.520]  Jones but she's not a bad person we can
[28:45.520 --> 28:47.520]  hopefully get in contact with her and wake her up
[28:47.520 --> 28:49.520]  but I mean did you notice her
[28:49.520 --> 28:51.520]  ignorance he's it's all about me
[28:51.520 --> 28:53.520]  it's mine no it takes
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.520]  who you are and lets the government and the system
[28:55.520 --> 28:57.520]  dehumanize you and track you
[28:57.520 --> 28:59.520]  off your Facebook that is connected to
[28:59.520 --> 29:01.520]  and dehumanize you honey
[29:01.520 --> 29:03.520]  okay and look
[29:03.520 --> 29:05.520]  she's probably a very nice person
[29:05.520 --> 29:07.520]  but but but
[29:07.520 --> 29:09.520]  once you're so self centered and so
[29:09.520 --> 29:11.520]  me it's my tattoo
[29:11.520 --> 29:13.520]  you'll find
[29:13.520 --> 29:15.520]  with these vassals
[29:15.520 --> 29:17.520]  out there that can't even think for themselves
[29:17.520 --> 29:19.520]  that
[29:19.520 --> 29:21.520]  that they just love the latest form
[29:21.520 --> 29:23.520]  of dehumanization
[29:23.520 --> 29:25.520]  and hey it's your body
[29:25.520 --> 29:27.520]  but but the issue is
[29:27.520 --> 29:29.520]  uh that
[29:29.520 --> 29:31.520]  well it's a very
[29:31.520 --> 29:33.520]  sophisticated issue but on the
[29:33.520 --> 29:35.520]  face of it the Nazis put
[29:35.520 --> 29:37.520]  digital numbers so they could put it in a computer
[29:37.520 --> 29:39.520]  to track the concentration camp
[29:39.520 --> 29:41.520]  victims and we all know this
[29:41.520 --> 29:43.520]  and we know this is being deployed against everyone
[29:43.520 --> 29:53.520]  well they ride back
[29:53.520 --> 29:55.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:01.520 --> 30:03.520]  hundreds of nations have fallen to
[30:03.520 --> 30:05.520]  tyranny in the last century alone
[30:05.520 --> 30:07.520]  this is our last chance to not
[30:07.520 --> 30:09.520]  relive history as we're finishing off
[30:09.520 --> 30:11.520]  this agenda that we're pulling
[30:11.520 --> 30:13.820]  a rug from underneath Americans at home.
[30:13.820 --> 30:18.680]  I have turned a tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are
[30:18.680 --> 30:19.680]  calling the shots.
[30:19.680 --> 30:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[30:25.000 --> 30:30.480]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[30:30.480 --> 30:35.160]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[30:35.160 --> 30:37.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[30:37.560 --> 30:38.560]  They're asking for more matches.
[30:38.560 --> 30:41.560]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[30:41.560 --> 30:43.440]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[30:43.440 --> 30:48.920]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[30:48.920 --> 30:55.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[30:55.000 --> 31:00.640]  now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[31:00.640 --> 31:05.280]  Alex has told you about the terrible perfect storm of rising food prices.
[31:05.280 --> 31:08.480]  The Japanese tragedy proves how important food is.
[31:08.480 --> 31:11.800]  Our own gas prices are driving food costs through the roof.
[31:11.800 --> 31:16.840]  The huge population countries are buying up American unprotected exports of food.
[31:16.840 --> 31:19.400]  The falling dollars inflating food prices.
[31:19.400 --> 31:24.320]  Ethanol subsidies are driving fuel and food costs to all time highs.
[31:24.320 --> 31:29.320]  We are experiencing the greatest explosion of food shortages and food prices America
[31:29.320 --> 31:30.520]  has ever seen.
[31:30.520 --> 31:35.240]  Folks, you have to freeze the cost and availability of your food now.

[31:59.640 --> 32:05.120]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[32:05.120 --> 32:07.880]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[32:07.880 --> 32:10.440]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[32:10.440 --> 32:14.160]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care
[32:14.160 --> 32:15.840]  of your health and your own family.
[32:15.840 --> 32:18.840]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[32:18.840 --> 32:21.200]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[32:21.200 --> 32:25.400]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[32:25.400 --> 32:27.440]  small owner, General Growth Properties.
[32:27.440 --> 32:30.760]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[32:30.760 --> 32:34.840]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[32:34.840 --> 32:38.040]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[32:38.040 --> 32:39.520]  I can't stress this enough.
[32:39.520 --> 32:42.160]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[32:42.160 --> 32:46.400]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[32:46.400 --> 32:51.080]  You can find the video at www.EndofAmerica3.com.
[32:51.080 --> 32:53.720]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[32:53.720 --> 32:57.520]  Watch the free video at www.EndofAmerica3.com.
[32:57.520 --> 33:09.920]  That's EndofAmerica3.com Get up, stand up.
[33:09.920 --> 33:13.080]  Escape from the present planet.
[33:13.080 --> 33:24.520]  All right, if you just joined us in the last segment, we showed a young lady saying it's
[33:24.520 --> 33:25.520]  mine.
[33:25.520 --> 33:26.840]  It's my personal tattoo.
[33:26.840 --> 33:28.080]  No one else can have it.
[33:28.080 --> 33:29.080]  It's mine.
[33:29.080 --> 33:37.000]  A very, very interesting KPHO out of Phoenix reports on Phoenix tattoo artists offer scanner
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.720]  codes, and this is going on in other places in the U.S. and Europe, but his particular
[33:41.720 --> 33:46.280]  case has gotten a lot of attention, and these are those modern barcodes that look like a
[33:46.280 --> 33:50.920]  collection of little squares and dots, and it's very popular.
[33:50.920 --> 33:56.960]  You see people sticking it up on the sides of areas on city streets where flyers are
[33:56.960 --> 33:57.960]  hung.
[33:57.960 --> 34:01.720]  You can walk up with your smart phone and scan it, and then it takes you to the website,
[34:01.720 --> 34:07.640]  I guess instead of actually walking up and say, typing in infowars.com, you just actually
[34:07.640 --> 34:12.840]  just go there, and I wanted to talk about this because there's a big move, and I saw
[34:12.840 --> 34:19.000]  an article back in 1999 in The Washington Post saying the Pentagon was interested in
[34:19.000 --> 34:27.000]  the self-mutilation community, the tattoo community, the body modification community,
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.640]  because they thought that was a way to mainline implantable microchips and barcode tattoos
[34:31.640 --> 34:35.080]  for the military and others, and Mainstream News reported they've had test programs with
[34:35.080 --> 34:41.160]  implantable chips with the U.S. military, so I'm very interested in this overall move,
[34:41.160 --> 34:49.400]  and joining us is Levi Smith, and Levi Smith is with the Jade Monkey Tattoo in Phoenix,
[34:49.400 --> 34:50.400]  Arizona.
[34:50.400 --> 34:54.680]  He's the owner, twitter.com, Levi Tattoo.
[34:54.680 --> 34:58.000]  Facebook is Tattoo Monkey.
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  Thank you for joining us, Levi.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.080]  Hey, thank you for having me, man.
[35:01.080 --> 35:03.200]  So where did you get the idea to start this?
[35:03.200 --> 35:07.960]  Tell us about the technology, tell us about how many people are getting these there at
[35:07.960 --> 35:08.960]  your tattoo shop.
[35:08.960 --> 35:14.640]  Well, I've done three of them so far now, and this QR code technology has been around
[35:14.640 --> 35:17.920]  for actually quite a while, I guess around like 20 years, so it's really popular in
[35:17.920 --> 35:21.880]  Japan and stuff, and it seems to be a really great and effective marketing tool, it's going
[35:21.880 --> 35:24.840]  to be getting a lot more popular in the U.S.
[35:24.840 --> 35:29.520]  And I was checking them out for using it for marketing, and I ran across on the Internet
[35:29.520 --> 35:34.440]  this guy knit that QR code into a sweater, and you could still scan it with a smartphone
[35:34.440 --> 35:40.720]  and it would still take you to where it was supposed to take you, and so with that I figured
[35:40.720 --> 35:46.200]  out, well, I could tattoo one of those, so I called up a friend of mine, and without really
[35:46.200 --> 35:51.840]  knowing if it would actually scan or not, we did a little test run, and it turned out,
[35:51.840 --> 35:57.160]  and I was actually kind of shocked that it was scantable, and so I put the word out and
[35:57.160 --> 36:01.640]  I did a couple more, and now I'm tattooing a heavy metal band, each member of the band
[36:01.640 --> 36:07.000]  is getting the QR code tattooed on the go to their band website and all that stuff,
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  and yeah, and it's a pretty stripped out thing.
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.360]  Well, look, I'm not here to judge you individually, and obviously this is a fun gimmick, but
[36:15.360 --> 36:21.680]  obviously you, many people have gotten fake barcode tattoos with 1984 under it to say
[36:21.680 --> 36:25.840]  that they're against being turned into a product, they're against the face scanning
[36:25.840 --> 36:31.520]  that creates a digital barcode from the measurements of your face and your thumb print being used
[36:31.520 --> 36:35.480]  for some really draconian government controls, I'm sure you've heard about license plate
[36:35.480 --> 36:41.680]  reading cameras, face scanning cameras, and the fact that people would want to run out
[36:41.680 --> 36:46.080]  and get a barcode and put it on their body to then connect it to their Facebook, I'm
[36:46.080 --> 36:51.280]  sure you've seen the reports about the dehumanizing effects of Facebook and things like that where
[36:51.280 --> 36:56.080]  people don't have real relationships, they just basically collect friends like baseball
[36:56.080 --> 36:57.080]  cards.
[36:57.080 --> 37:04.240]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely, I agree with that as well, and there's a clear line between
[37:04.240 --> 37:08.280]  the people that are really interested in this sort of thing versus those that really find
[37:08.280 --> 37:13.960]  it kind of abhorrent and find it as something that's kind of a warning as potential times
[37:13.960 --> 37:20.400]  to come with the lost privatization and the increasing influence of technology in our
[37:20.400 --> 37:23.240]  media person a lot.
[37:23.240 --> 37:27.360]  The people that are really getting them much more tend to be younger people, counterculture
[37:27.360 --> 37:33.680]  people, people that are kind of using it to kind of own it the same way that like minority
[37:33.680 --> 37:38.400]  groups would use racial flers and stuff towards themselves as a way to kind of take it back
[37:38.400 --> 37:40.960]  sort of thing.
[37:40.960 --> 37:45.080]  There's a lady getting one of these where she says it's mine, only I can have it, but
[37:45.080 --> 37:50.720]  I mean, I don't see that as it being hers, it now ties her into the matrix and she's
[37:50.720 --> 37:56.520]  basically taking some corporate Pentagon, I mean it is the Pentagon that developed the
[37:56.520 --> 38:05.240]  barcode in 1984 of all years, they made a deal with Walmart to demand all of their suppliers
[38:05.240 --> 38:12.400]  have the barcode, now they want RFID tracker chips in all products so that in MIT and the
[38:12.400 --> 38:17.200]  Pentagon's own words, they'll be able to track the real world like cyberspace with all these
[38:17.200 --> 38:22.240]  tracker chips and I've noticed with clothes I get laundered, they now stick an RFID glued
[38:22.240 --> 38:26.400]  sticker without asking me that rips your clothes if you take it off so now I have to go to
[38:26.400 --> 38:30.440]  a new laundry place and get some of my clothes laundered because they're not even asking,
[38:30.440 --> 38:35.520]  they're just sticking this on my clothes, gluing it to it and sure it's convenient for them
[38:35.520 --> 38:40.000]  but more and more, I'm sure you've heard about the FBI putting tracker chips on cars without
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  warrants.
[38:41.000 --> 38:47.440]  Right, and it's a further attempt to digitize reality because it's so much easier to control
[38:47.440 --> 38:54.120]  a digital world than the real chaotic world, so in an attempt to control that more, this
[38:54.120 --> 39:00.240]  could very well be used as a method these QR code tattoos but also they're very, very
[39:00.240 --> 39:07.520]  easy to modify and stuff so I don't think that they're really viable as a control device
[39:07.520 --> 39:14.080]  or tracking device or something like RFID chips or some kind of like magnetized things
[39:14.080 --> 39:17.400]  or some crazy nanotechnology, I've heard about it.
[39:17.400 --> 39:22.360]  Sure, you're right but I'm telling you, the Pentagon was in Washington Tech, the tech
[39:22.360 --> 39:29.040]  publication, the Washington Post at the time, in 99 and they said we love the body modification,
[39:29.040 --> 39:35.000]  the mutilation, the tattoo movement, mainlining, the body piercings because their psychological
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.280]  warfare breakdowns show that that would then cause the public to accept forced microchipping
[39:40.280 --> 39:45.520]  as the Mexican Attorney General did seven years ago of his office employees in Mexico
[39:45.520 --> 39:52.640]  City and so my point here is that you're right, we don't need the tattoo, they already
[39:52.640 --> 39:56.400]  get your digital photo when you get a driver's license, put it in a federal database and
[39:56.400 --> 40:04.640]  now can track you, your face basically forms their own barcode but my whole issue is just,
[40:04.640 --> 40:08.640]  is you hear about the VeraChip company that signed up with a bunch of Baja Beach clubs
[40:08.640 --> 40:12.840]  in the U.S. and Europe to get into the VIP area with the girls and bikinis, you've got
[40:12.840 --> 40:14.840]  to take an implantable microchip?
[40:14.840 --> 40:20.240]  Really, wow, I've heard of VeraChip but I didn't realize that they were already implementing
[40:20.240 --> 40:24.960]  that in those kinds of ways on a commercial level, that's crazy.
[40:24.960 --> 40:29.920]  Yeah, if you just type into search engine Baja Beach club or night clubs, Baja Beach
[40:29.920 --> 40:37.800]  club, night club, VeraChip and plantable chip, I mean because that's what the global engineers,
[40:37.800 --> 40:40.800]  Ray Kurzweil and others write books about it, they say look, at first you won't be
[40:40.800 --> 40:44.640]  able to have a job if you're not implanted and if you don't do all this augmentation
[40:44.640 --> 40:45.640]  and brain chips.
[40:45.640 --> 40:51.720]  Yeah, you'll be a not a person if you sit out and refuse to get these trackable devices
[40:51.720 --> 40:56.320]  that control your ability to purchase and sell and everything that we've always been
[40:56.320 --> 41:00.840]  warned about, then you're not going to be allowed to take part in that digital society.
[41:00.840 --> 41:02.840]  You know, you won't be able to purchase.
[41:02.840 --> 41:08.120]  Exactly, by standardizing Levi, and obviously you're a smart guy here talking to you, I
[41:08.120 --> 41:10.880]  wasn't going to yell at you but you obviously know what's going on.
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.520]  Yeah, this is totally my sort of thing, I've had some of my friends call me the Antichrist
[41:15.520 --> 41:22.280]  for doing this and I think it's kind of funny and I may be in some way contributing to the
[41:22.280 --> 41:28.760]  psychological acceptance of doing this sort of thing, but it's not something that I'm
[41:28.760 --> 41:34.560]  not necessarily blind towards and I'm not exactly for it either but at the same time
[41:34.560 --> 41:40.200]  I'm part of that counterculture movement that wants to kind of own it, you know, if we can
[41:40.200 --> 41:44.960]  use this technology in ways that I don't understand it, maybe we can use it to fight that.
[41:44.960 --> 41:50.760]  But Levi Smith, when you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, he changes you,
[41:50.760 --> 41:54.760]  but we're staring into the abyss, unless you become the abyss.
[41:54.760 --> 42:00.840]  But expanding on that, here's what I'm trying to say, the Pentagon, MIT, they all created
[42:00.840 --> 42:04.760]  the global infrastructure, the internet, all these systems, they admit that they're going
[42:04.760 --> 42:09.680]  to force all business through it so that then only mega corporations can basically operate
[42:09.680 --> 42:15.400]  in the system and all of this barcoding, all of this stuff is extincting local businesses,
[42:15.400 --> 42:21.120]  community, now they're harassing roadside places selling eggs or oranges or watermelons,
[42:21.120 --> 42:25.880]  they're now arresting people selling fresh milk, they're now hunting down with the animal
[42:25.880 --> 42:31.420]  ID, premises ID, trying to shut down local farms and ranches, this is a full spectrum
[42:31.420 --> 42:37.640]  dominance matrix control system and I'm telling you, you can't own this, I'm telling you this
[42:37.640 --> 42:42.160]  is playing directly into their hands, perhaps by you doing this and now if you speak out
[42:42.160 --> 42:46.720]  about it and point this out, perhaps some good could be made of it, but I'm telling
[42:46.720 --> 42:49.360]  you this is going to destroy us.
[42:49.360 --> 42:55.800]  Yeah, you know, there's a great possibility of that, I've got a lot of faith in humanity
[42:55.800 --> 43:01.560]  and the inherent difficulty in actually maintaining any kind of control over us for a certain
[43:01.560 --> 43:08.320]  amount of time, I mean you know, it's also said that you know, that we'll win, you know,
[43:08.320 --> 43:13.440]  the people will win, but it's that trial and tribulation that we have to go through that
[43:13.440 --> 43:20.960]  maybe will help us in a way and help move our culture forward and move out of this violent
[43:20.960 --> 43:29.080]  kind of state that we tend to have been in for the past, oh I don't know, 3000 years.
[43:29.080 --> 43:38.760]  Well Levi, here's the issue, the system implants modern versions of Christianity on record
[43:38.760 --> 43:43.120]  to make people believe the world is basically going to go through something so we can't
[43:43.120 --> 43:47.920]  stop this inevitable foregone conclusion, self-fulfilling prophecy, when the truth is
[43:47.920 --> 43:54.600]  every generation goes through crises and we need to, you know, Rwandans when they were
[43:54.600 --> 43:59.240]  being murdered, you know, the Tutsis were being killed by the Hutus or was it vice versa,
[43:59.240 --> 44:03.040]  they believed it was the Tutsis being killed by the Hutus, check that for me folks, my
[44:03.040 --> 44:08.240]  memory fails in 93 or 94, the point is is that they believed it was the end of the world
[44:08.240 --> 44:11.840]  and it was the Antichrist, people in Germany thought it was the end of the world and the
[44:11.840 --> 44:17.240]  Antichrist was Hitler, but the point is there are many Antichrist and we need to say no
[44:17.240 --> 44:23.000]  to this system now because even if it is the end of the world coming, we are being tested
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.440]  now on the decisions we make and listen, that doesn't mean I'm on some high horse about
[44:28.440 --> 44:29.440]  what you're doing.
[44:29.440 --> 44:34.760]  No, no, I get you, you know, this is something that's indicative of, you know, the warnings
[44:34.760 --> 44:41.520]  and whatnot, you know, and I agree that we have to, you know, we have to be cautious
[44:41.520 --> 44:48.680]  towards these things, but, you know, I don't know, it's, you know, to me it's a novelty
[44:48.680 --> 44:53.760]  and I'm a bit of a tech head and, you know, like with like Ray Kurzweil and stuff, you
[44:53.760 --> 44:59.400]  know, I'm really optimistic about what technology can do for us and whatnot and also it's inherent
[44:59.400 --> 45:02.320]  dangers of, you know, what it can take from us.
[45:02.320 --> 45:06.520]  Sure, but I mean, you're probably getting into his more public rantings where it's
[45:06.520 --> 45:09.800]  meant to look good to the proletariat.
[45:09.800 --> 45:14.680]  Here's an example, most big gyms in Austin now, I can't have a membership at because
[45:14.680 --> 45:20.560]  they make you thumb scan to go in and lift weights, libraries, many public schools make
[45:20.560 --> 45:24.360]  the kids thumb print, no cash allowed, no credit cards allowed, it tracks everything
[45:24.360 --> 45:25.360]  you do.
[45:25.360 --> 45:30.320]  We're entering a system under a global sales tax collected nationally, delivered to the
[45:30.320 --> 45:36.720]  IMF and World Bank internationally, where you're not going to be able to accept cash,
[45:36.720 --> 45:41.320]  you're not going to be able to accept a check, it's all being phased out, you're going to
[45:41.320 --> 45:48.720]  have to pay with your face scan, with your barcode, with your chip, with your RFID.
[45:48.720 --> 45:53.560]  And that's so you can't escape the taxes that are going to go up and up and up that are
[45:53.560 --> 45:59.400]  designed to break down the once vibrant real economy and the black market economy.
[45:59.400 --> 46:03.360]  So this system is death to true local community.
[46:03.360 --> 46:05.360]  Right, right.
[46:05.360 --> 46:18.320]  And I do get you, I'm not sure what to say as far as my position with doing the QR codes,
[46:18.320 --> 46:28.120]  I do realize my part in the, I guess, the acceptance of this sort of thing, but I don't
[46:28.120 --> 46:36.880]  know, I seem to have a little bit more optimism in humanity's ability to generally resist
[46:36.880 --> 46:37.880]  this sort of thing.
[46:37.880 --> 46:40.280]  Oh, I have optimism, that's why I'm fighting right now.
[46:40.280 --> 46:41.280]  Right, right.
[46:41.280 --> 46:46.040]  Oh, we are going to win, the answer to 1984 is 1776, do you have any children, Levi?
[46:46.040 --> 46:48.520]  Yes, I do, I have a daughter, yeah.
[46:48.520 --> 46:50.280]  How old is she, five, six?
[46:50.280 --> 46:52.160]  She's actually two months old.
[46:52.160 --> 46:57.400]  Well, we're entering a time when she's 10, 12 years old, where would you stand up and
[46:57.400 --> 47:02.640]  fight or speak out if they were saying your daughter had to face scan when she buys and
[47:02.640 --> 47:05.280]  sells or just be a camera on the wall, but it's already here.
[47:05.280 --> 47:10.040]  But you know, to make sure she pays her national sales taxes, it's going to be graduated.
[47:10.040 --> 47:12.120]  I mean, would you be against that?
[47:12.120 --> 47:13.120]  Would you speak out against that?
[47:13.120 --> 47:14.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[47:14.120 --> 47:15.120]  You know, absolutely.
[47:15.120 --> 47:19.680]  Okay, because the fight is now there, I mean, they're integrating this, they're setting
[47:19.680 --> 47:23.720]  it up, they had face scanning cameras up at the town I live in 10 years ago, they only
[47:23.720 --> 47:25.520]  admitted to the slaves last year.
[47:25.520 --> 47:30.120]  I mean, sir, the war is now, I mean, I'm just telling you, did you know that most major
[47:30.120 --> 47:34.120]  cities don't just add fluoride to the water, they actually add radioactive isotopes?
[47:34.120 --> 47:39.560]  Right, right, you know, treating the water and stuff to control, you know, various balances
[47:39.560 --> 47:42.840]  in the body and the brain and whatnot, keep it soft-filed and, you know.
[47:42.840 --> 47:46.360]  I mean, because that's admitted, I have the Rockefeller Foundation reports, it's also
[47:46.360 --> 47:48.280]  to kill you, slowly kill you.
[47:48.280 --> 47:51.760]  I mean, I just, this is pretty hardcore is what I'm saying.
[47:51.760 --> 47:52.760]  Right.
[47:52.760 --> 47:58.240]  And, you know, the point is, we've been eased in to this cold water, they've turned the
[47:58.240 --> 48:02.120]  heat up and now we're boiling and I'm just saying, I don't think we're going to own
[48:02.120 --> 48:09.080]  this getting barcodes that can actually be scanned by enemy platforms like Facebook.
[48:09.080 --> 48:12.600]  It's one thing to go into Facebook as we do, into the matrix to try to reach people with
[48:12.600 --> 48:17.760]  red pills, but I think it's another thing, you know, to kind of say, make me a movie
[48:17.760 --> 48:18.760]  star in the matrix.
[48:18.760 --> 48:19.760]  Right.
[48:19.760 --> 48:20.760]  And I don't remember anything.
[48:20.760 --> 48:24.960]  Well, you know, at the same time, you know, people have been able to, you know, individuals
[48:24.960 --> 48:29.120]  have been able to kind of own some of this technology and stuff and even use like Facebook
[48:29.120 --> 48:32.120]  and Twitter to, you know, to overthrow dictators even.
[48:32.120 --> 48:39.320]  So, it's kind of, you know, it's kind of difficult to fully predict how these people, especially
[48:39.320 --> 48:44.520]  these younger generations, would seem to be so natural at all of this technology.
[48:44.520 --> 48:45.520]  Sure.
[48:45.520 --> 48:49.960]  There are some people who are young and angry in Egypt and Libya, but, you know, Al Qaeda
[48:49.960 --> 48:52.560]  and the Pentagon are the real ones running.
[48:52.560 --> 48:57.320]  I mean, have you seen the news, how they admit Al Qaeda is the good guys now in Libya?
[48:57.320 --> 49:01.440]  Right, right, that the Eastern Libyan faction could have Al Qaeda elements.
[49:01.440 --> 49:03.440]  Oh, they've run by Al Qaeda, yeah.
[49:03.440 --> 49:08.240]  Have you heard about Amar al-Aqqi, the, now the head of Al Qaeda hanging out secretly
[49:08.240 --> 49:09.240]  at the Pentagon?
[49:09.240 --> 49:10.240]  No.
[49:10.240 --> 49:12.240]  I haven't heard about that.
[49:12.240 --> 49:19.880]  Yeah, look, they, the State Department registers and controls and works with Twitter.
[49:19.880 --> 49:24.800]  And I'm just here to tell you that those were stage revolutions over there.
[49:24.800 --> 49:29.120]  You noticed in Bahrain and other places where they're machine gunning crowds, the, you know...
[49:29.120 --> 49:33.120]  Yeah, they haven't had the same kind of response equally throughout everything, that's, that's
[49:33.120 --> 49:34.120]  the truth.
[49:34.120 --> 49:39.360]  Well, yeah, we're not seeing coalition air raids on our allies who are shooting people.
[49:39.360 --> 49:40.360]  Yeah.
[49:40.360 --> 49:41.360]  Yeah, absolutely.
[49:41.360 --> 49:43.560]  Well, listen, I don't want to just sit here and talk at you.
[49:43.560 --> 49:46.400]  You've been a really nice guy, Levi Smith.
[49:46.400 --> 49:48.000]  I appreciate it.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.880]  And so, so what do you got folks lining up now to get their barcode tattoos?
[49:51.880 --> 49:56.640]  Um, yeah, some of them are, and then, uh, yeah, and then some people are pretty upset,
[49:56.640 --> 49:57.640]  you know.
[49:57.640 --> 49:59.120]  It's, uh, it's about 50-50 right now, so...
[49:59.120 --> 50:00.120]  Yeah.
[50:00.120 --> 50:04.880]  If that's the indication, it's the, it's the state of the, uh, uh, you know, acceptance
[50:04.880 --> 50:05.880]  towards this sort of thing.
[50:05.880 --> 50:10.840]  Well, I understand your sophisticated view of, hey, it's individual, people made the
[50:10.840 --> 50:15.360]  choice, it's a way to own it, but, but, but you have to understand the symbol of something,
[50:15.360 --> 50:18.880]  even if somebody, say, got a swastika on their arm and they weren't a Nazi, and they said
[50:18.880 --> 50:23.640]  I got it to educate people about, you know, tyranny, still some people would be upset
[50:23.640 --> 50:26.920]  by the symbol because of their, you know, their head screwed on straight.
[50:26.920 --> 50:31.640]  And so it's that symbol, it's that response, like, you can throw a rubber snake at somebody
[50:31.640 --> 50:33.080]  and a lot of them will kind of jump back.
[50:33.080 --> 50:39.160]  It's not that it's a real snake, but, uh, it elicits that response, but in your case,
[50:39.160 --> 50:45.040]  it is a real snake, uh, and look, very interesting discussion, Levi Smith, tattoo artist at the
[50:45.040 --> 50:50.840]  Jade Monkey tattoo in Phoenix, Arizona, um, take care of my friend, but, uh, what does
[50:50.840 --> 50:53.640]  it profit a man to gain the whole world if he loses his soul?
[50:53.640 --> 50:55.360]  I'm not saying, I'm not judging you.
[50:55.360 --> 50:57.360]  I'm as wicked as the day is long as well.
[50:57.360 --> 51:00.760]  I appreciate you joining us.
[51:00.760 --> 51:04.480]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

[52:02.760 --> 52:08.280]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[52:08.280 --> 52:12.440]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[52:12.440 --> 52:13.440]  documents.
[52:13.440 --> 52:17.880]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[52:17.880 --> 52:20.360]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:20.360 --> 52:25.200]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the
[52:25.200 --> 52:26.200]  world.
[52:26.200 --> 52:31.400]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[52:31.400 --> 52:33.880]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:33.880 --> 52:38.360]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[52:38.360 --> 52:39.360]  financial system.
[52:39.360 --> 52:42.240]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:42.240 --> 52:45.960]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[52:45.960 --> 52:48.760]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.

[52:54.800 --> 52:58.360]  it online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:58.360 --> 53:00.880]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[53:00.880 --> 53:04.840]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[53:04.840 --> 53:06.480]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[53:06.480 --> 53:10.520]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[53:10.520 --> 53:11.520]  or gold?
[53:11.520 --> 53:14.800]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and
[53:14.800 --> 53:17.040]  it's possible that could even happen again.
[53:17.040 --> 53:21.600]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[53:21.600 --> 53:22.600]  seeds.
[53:22.600 --> 53:27.520]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[53:27.520 --> 53:29.400]  food for you and your family.
[53:29.400 --> 53:30.520]  And here's the best part.
[53:30.520 --> 53:34.720]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[53:34.720 --> 53:37.200]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[53:37.200 --> 53:40.440]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[53:40.440 --> 53:47.240]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[53:47.240 --> 53:51.400]  That's 877-327-0365.
[53:51.400 --> 53:56.240]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[53:56.240 --> 54:03.480]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[54:03.480 --> 54:08.280]  I talked to that tattoo artist, Levi Smith, during the break it turned out he is a quote
[54:08.280 --> 54:15.280]  fan of our films, didn't really realize what show he was on until he was partway into it.
[54:15.280 --> 54:22.840]  But here's the deal, these are working real barcodes, it just mainlines it, the cultures
[54:22.840 --> 54:27.480]  putting them up everywhere to sell us on this system, we're being conditioned like animals
[54:27.480 --> 54:29.000]  and I don't like it.
[54:29.000 --> 54:37.000]  So there is a malevolent corrupt dehumanizing system pushing all of this and I'm sure Mr.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.400]  Smith's nice, I'm sure the lady who's tattooing Ms. Jones is nice.
[54:40.400 --> 54:47.040]  I think it's shameful to do this to your body, to do this to your flesh, to put barcodes
[54:47.040 --> 54:51.240]  on it so people can visit your Facebook easier because they're too lazy.
[54:51.240 --> 54:58.360]  And since the Texas Instruments 30-something years ago came out with their cheaper calculators,
[54:58.360 --> 55:02.560]  first they were thousands of dollars a piece, mathematics is falling completely off, most
[55:02.560 --> 55:05.160]  people with spell checkers now can't spell.
[55:05.160 --> 55:10.400]  I mean it's almost like we're going to turn into legless, eyeless, earless little creatures
[55:10.400 --> 55:15.000]  that would just plug into our head who can't even communicate because we are being dehumanized
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.400]  by this.
[55:16.400 --> 55:19.720]  Technology is neutral but the way it's being deployed, it's architecture, the way it's
[55:19.720 --> 55:26.000]  being arranged is to break us off from the land, from reality, you know, the average
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.440]  young people are just running around having fun all into themselves, not worried about
[55:29.440 --> 55:35.520]  radiation settling in over the US, cloud after cloud, day after day belched out of the Fukushima
[55:35.520 --> 55:41.480]  shattered facility, plutonium uranium spraying out, 100,000 times safe levels, one core they
[55:41.480 --> 55:45.360]  admit is completely melted through the floor and is going into the water table.
[55:45.360 --> 55:48.880]  I mean this is just off the charts horrible and you know they're not going to test the
[55:48.880 --> 55:52.400]  seafood in America out of the Pacific, you're going to eat it, we're going to eat it, we're
[55:52.400 --> 55:56.000]  going to keep using cell phones that are giving us brain tumors on record, we're going to
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.600]  keep drinking the fluoride until we wake up and say no and it's really that simple.
[56:01.600 --> 56:06.200]  We're almost out of the book if you want to get an excellent book to get into reality,
[56:06.200 --> 56:10.560]  we're almost out of it, Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Save Places by Joel
[56:10.560 --> 56:15.800]  Scalzen, we're now shipping out Jesse Ventura, 63 documents, the government doesn't want
[56:15.800 --> 56:20.600]  you to read, very powerful book, great to what, very sophisticated and complex and detailed,
[56:20.600 --> 56:24.560]  but very good for somebody who's not awake to what's happening because it's got 63 documents
[56:24.560 --> 56:29.440]  like Northwood's and just countless others that will blow your mind, government drug
[56:29.440 --> 56:34.440]  dealing, you name it, it's all here, I think it's Ventura's best book, we've got a big
[56:34.440 --> 56:39.520]  discount on it out of the gates, infowars.com, that's how you support us.
[56:39.520 --> 56:44.640]  Also the new book, Big Brother, the Orwellian Nightmare Come True, only available at infowars.com

[56:48.640 --> 56:52.240]  thousand for him, we'll be the main distributor until those are sold out, but Big Brother,
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.760]  the Orwellian Nightmare Come True, excellent book breaking down how we're integrated already
[56:56.760 --> 57:01.360]  into a Big Brother society, all that's left is the internet kill switch and arresting political
[57:01.360 --> 57:05.880]  dissidents because we're terrorists according to the media because we don't like al-Qaeda.
[57:05.880 --> 57:10.240]  So all of that available at infowars.com, the great new film of course by Jason Burma's

[58:50.400 --> 58:54.720]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[58:54.720 --> 58:59.040]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family
[58:59.040 --> 59:04.400]  owned and operated American company. My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly
[59:04.400 --> 59:08.480]  telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes. There
[59:08.480 --> 59:13.360]  is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[59:13.360 --> 59:22.040]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[59:22.040 --> 59:49.600]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[59:52.040 --> 01:00:05.160]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:13.840]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:24.600]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:30.200]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to do a detailed breakdown of the globalist
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.840]  current geopolitical strategy to overthrow the Middle East and install new puppet dictators
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.960]  who then completely ban free speech and protesting like has been done in Egypt that hailed by
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.240]  our media is wonderful. Again, the globalists want that here as well. They install tyrannies
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.960]  everywhere. But when we come back from break, remember we've had all these White House
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.600]  advisors, all these Democratic Party advisors saying we need terror attacks to get our agenda
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.240]  through so the public loves us again and sees us as their saviors. And they want to blame
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.640]  it on domestic groups, you name it. Just like the government got caught basically sending
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.000]  out the anthrax letters, and it was super U.S. government weaponized, and the FBI lied
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  about it for years. Now, Chicago CBS reports threats claim nuclear bombs hidden all over
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.680]  U.S. The threats came in the mail and to date there have been 25 letters that warn of nuclear
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.680]  bombs destroying America. How about letters claiming Godzilla is going to attack New York
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:33.800]  City next Tuesday or that flying saucers are going to attack Albuquerque tomorrow? I mean,
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.400]  it's like and we're all a lock you admittedly works for the Pentagon. A letter shows up
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.520]  on the Internet that, you know, he's loving what's happening in Libya, and it's just taken
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:48.200]  as if it's completely real. They've had what a college student out in San Francisco five,
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.840]  six years ago did a fake beheading in his garage and for a week they rounded as if it
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:58.080]  was real because the media is primed to pick up any disinfo usually produced by the government.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.520]  You know, Al-Qaeda videos that have been uploaded by the Intel Center Wired Magazine
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:06.320]  has reported have the Al-Qaeda logo and the Intel Center logo in the same video layer.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.640]  It was uploaded together. You understand that? And so I'm going to be breaking this down
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.800]  because they really want to get the fear going. If they don't stage a terror attack,
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:21.520]  they at least want to hype one that Al-Qaeda has got 160 nukes. Why a letter said so? And
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:26.080]  I'm looking at the handwriting and we'll put the article on screen. I mean, if you blow
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:33.040]  that up, it looks just like the same handwriting that was sent out with the anthrax letters.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.480]  And so this is just all part of the terrorist are going to get you. Love the government.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:42.880]  Love the bankers robbing you. Drink your fluoride. Take your prozac. Breathe your uranium. It's
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.080]  good for you. Two plus two equals whatever we say it equals. It certainly doesn't equal
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.640]  four though. And it equals everything else but four. And so you better give up all your
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.760]  rights because Al-Qaeda is going to hit you any minute. And we've got to have these wars
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.880]  because Al-Qaeda is evil and bad and dangerous and horrible, but they are also heroes fighting
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:09.240]  against the evil Gaddafi. Your life. That doesn't make sense. Why? In fact, I know you
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.040]  guys have printed it a hundred times, but we just want to hold it in my hand and read
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.960]  it to people. You print me the Fox News, Amarala, Locky hanging out secretly at the Pentagon.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.040]  This is confirmed. Where's the congressional investigation? Where? Where's the fact people
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.600]  are going? Well, you used Al-Qaeda against the Serbs. You use it against the Russians.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.320]  You use it the threat of it to take our liberties here at home. Amarala, Locky running all these
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.800]  attacks hanging out in the U.S. I'm going to cover this when we come back. And I specifically
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:41.320]  only want to hear from listeners on this issue of how it's the biggest hoax I know of.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:48.880]  Militarily, strategically, via security, that Al-Qaeda is always funded, created by the
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.800]  people that run the U.S., not the U.S., but the bankers that have hijacked us, always
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.400]  being protected by them, always being run by them. I'm going to go through some examples
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:03.680]  of that when we come back. But separately, they're wonderful freedom fighters and this
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:10.120]  big CIA commander who's Middle Eastern, trained for decades in Virginia, admits in the news,
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:15.680]  yes, we're commanding Al-Qaeda. And Amarala, Locky's popped up, yes, it's a great jihad
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:21.480]  against secular Arab leaders like Muammar Qaddafi. I mean, this is crazy. They've always used
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:27.080]  radical Muslims, they call Al-Qaeda, to overthrow what the globalists see as stable governments.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:30.000]  Doesn't mean Qaddafi's good. Doesn't mean any of these guys are good. The point is,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.200]  they're not globalist. They're not playing patty cake properly. Now Qaddafi six years
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:40.160]  ago did deals with Europe and the U.S. to play patty cake. That was only so the globalists
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.560]  could insert their spies in there. And now they're doing it. We're going to come back,
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.960]  break down the fact that they're hyping stage terror. This time, hundreds of nukes going
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.000]  off in the U.S. That's your government, with just fake letters, waving them around to fair
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.120]  monger the sheeple into loving the New World Order. We'll be right back. Gerald Slunte
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:01.280]  coming up.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.480]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.200]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions. Yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.040]  of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:19.520]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Sifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:24.200]  Lungs generator. Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:29.840]  ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:35.720]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:42.360]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:49.440]  to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:54.520]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works. As well, we are always ready to answer
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:06:00.240]  any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:04.880]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:09.200]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.520]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:18.600]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:23.240]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:28.880]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:33.200]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.880]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:42.080]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:46.160]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:52.920]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government

[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:21.720]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family, not worried about them moving
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:34.200]  itself, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow. I'm looking for America.

[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:48.200]  Land on a fray in my home of the brave. Seems like I just woke up one day and it was long,
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:54.200]  long gone. But I know in my heart it's still a little late.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:08:05.200]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America today.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:12.200]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:23.800]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.800]  Coming up in just a few minutes, I'm going to break down this incredible government
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:34.840]  media fear-mongering. Just random letters mailed in. They claim al-Qaeda is going to
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:43.320]  detonate and has buried over 160 nuclear bombs in the U.S. We're going to be breaking down
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:48.640]  this incredible fear-mongering ahead of what could be staged terror attacks in the U.S.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:56.120]  to really bring in the New World Order and the whole secret police citizen-spy grid
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:03.040]  that they've set up. Well, meanwhile, al-Qaeda, Amarala-Laki, and all of them publicly, in
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:09.400]  every case, are protected and work for the Pentagon. And again, I was even on Eric Mancal
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.320]  Muller's show today, and he's always attacked me on that. I go on there every Wednesday
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.200]  for years, and he said, no, you're right. It's true. It's admitted. There it is. Amarala-Laki
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.440]  works for the government. The rebels work for the government. It's all staged. They
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:26.280]  staged the whole deal, and they're now fear-mongering that their secret army of al-Qaeda is going
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.760]  to attack us. We don't give all of our rights up. That's coming up. Then I'm going to open
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:35.520]  the phones up ahead of Gerald Salente joining us, and then Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.440]  But before I go any further, I wanted to briefly hit some economic news. The Associated Press
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:45.960]  obviously is reporting home prices falling in most major U.S. cities, home prices falling
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:50.880]  in 19 major cities, with four now at lowest levels in 11 years. They've also found that
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:58.880]  areas seen as immune from the housing slump are now dropping, and also consumer confidence
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.440]  is at an all-time low since measurements began in the last 60 years of consumer confidence.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:10.640]  But the media is telling us that the economy is rebounded in June of 2009, close to two
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.960]  years ago, and that it's a conspiracy theory if you don't think everything's great, and
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:24.000]  the NAFTA and GATT and Walmart are wonderful. And OPEC set for $1,000 billion in export
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.760]  revenues. They made a trillion last year. Two-thirds of oil and gas leases in Gulf are
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.240]  inactive because the Interior Department will not issue permits, but don't worry, they're
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.120]  issuing permits in the Mediterranean off of Libya. They've already taken the main oil
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:44.440]  port and putting the rebels in the new government who signed everything over to the new private
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.280]  central bank that's been set up. So that's some of the news on that front. But I wanted
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.400]  to briefly get into gold and silver because if you look at the 11-year silver graph, and
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:59.440]  we'll put that on screen, or the 11-year gold graph, gold's gone from $258 at its
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:09.520]  slow to now over $1,400. Silver's gone from $5 to $35, almost $40. And what happens is,
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.040]  as you go up the stairs, and that's what it looks like, the stairs, sometimes there's
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.880]  little drops, but overall it rebounds more the next week, the next month. But the media
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.400]  rushes in and says, gold plunged, silver plunged, it's over. I mean, go down a couple
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:29.440]  bucks and they say that now, silver or 10, 20 bucks on gold. And then the yuppies, and
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.520]  I've had them say to my face, oh, look, gold's plunging. I get the emails or on the street
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.040]  or I talk to extended family and they're like, I heard gold went down. You're wrong now.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.440]  See, I was smart not to invest in it. Yeah, it was 200 and something bucks. Now it's
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.760]  1400. Yeah, it dropped $10, but then went right back up. Yeah, you're smart. Again,
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:52.640]  it's all this perception is reality. To them, two plus two doesn't equal four. It's just,
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:58.560]  oh no, you know, gold's gone down because they're not in the reality based community.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:08.160]  There's the 10 year graph. And is that silver or gold? That's gold because it's about 1400.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:16.240]  There it is at $258. Now about 1400. And let me show you the silver graph $5. Now it's
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:21.840]  been up close to 40. And Ted Anderson is going to pop in just briefly to talk about this
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:28.360]  psychological effect. See, we're wrong, Ted. Gold and silver didn't go up. We gave bad
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:34.200]  advice. Of course it did go up, but the invincible ignorance of some of the population who doesn't
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.040]  want to admit they made the wrong decision to not get into gold and silver. They don't
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.160]  want to admit that they made a bad decision. So they just play kind of fantasy land like
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.880]  a three year old does when they're pretending to be a polar bear, but they're not a polar
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:52.160]  bear or a pirate or Peter Pan. And they're just laughing at us right now. Ted, we're
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.160]  idiots, Ted.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.920]  Yeah, you're right about that. Alex, there's a club of Wall Street type people out there
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:01.600]  that just simply believe that gold and silver cannot be the best thing to be investing in.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.840]  Even though it really is, gold and silver is all performed just about anything you can
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.520]  think of out there. I mean, if you had your money in the stock market, you'd have done
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:15.560]  nothing but stay even and perhaps even lost 50 to 60% of your investment. The gold and
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:20.680]  silver, I mean, it's just, it's a no brainer. I mean, when you see the printing press running
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:24.840]  in Washington D.C., like we have it, people need to be buying gold and silver. It's not
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.840]  even an option anymore. Now we have Greece and Portugal falling apart. Spain is about
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.360]  ready to melt down. The whole EU is falling apart and the United States is broken. Guess
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.600]  what we're thinking about doing? Going to war with Libya. I mean, how are we going to
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.600]  afford the war?
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:42.400]  Well, by the way, the war is already going. The Marines are off the coast and now the
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:47.320]  news is saying, well, there'll be an invasion, but it's humanitarian.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.560]  What difference does it make, Alex? We can't afford it. It's quite a minute, Ted. It's
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.000]  not a war. It's a kinetic military action. There is no war, sir.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.080]  Well, you know, that's the thing. I mean, maybe we should hire Osama bin Laden to go
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:03.120]  fight Omar Gaddafi now. I mean, it's just, well, they actually have that. That's actually
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.880]  what's going on. But I mean, what, you don't, Ted, I guess you and I are un-American now
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.480]  because we don't like al-Qaeda and now we're anti-America. Do you want to apologize for
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.480]  not locking al-Qaeda?
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.640]  Yeah, I guess I might, I guess I'll have to here, but I mean, just none of that makes
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:22.700]  sense anymore, Alex. And what they're doing in, you know, with this war, it's just one
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:26.620]  more thing that we're getting tied to here. It's like you said, it's like the central
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:30.920]  banks want this to happen. Who cares what the government or the people want? I mean,
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:36.880]  Alex, I am so fed up with this. I just want everybody to get on the bandwagon and take
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:41.280]  these people off their perch. And the only way we're going to do it is by ending that
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:46.800]  central bank system, change the monetary system back to real money here in the United States.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:52.960]  That's what we need. The financial ground from which they support themselves with is
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.720]  having a printing press able to lend it to us and then collect interest on it and then
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.960]  now dictate policy.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.240]  Well, Ted, it's on the same subject, but we'll shift back into gold and silver here in a
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:07.200]  moment. But they're announcing coming up in just a few days early next month. They're
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.520]  having Bretton Woods to run by Soros, all the big world bankers meeting openly in the
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.400]  news saying to decide how to get rid of the dollar, which will be devastating. It's all
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:20.400]  we've got left is the fiat currency as much as I don't like it. That will literally be
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.040]  like pulling our heart out of us. Of course, the bankers have already got the new system.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:28.600]  So they're, they're positioned to move on now that they've sucked us dry through fraud.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.240]  But George Soros's media matters has said they're going to declare war on Fox news,
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:37.320]  but also other what is seen as conservative or anti-new world order groups, including
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:42.880]  yours truly, I'm prominently listed there with guerrilla warfare sabotage meant to bankrupt
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.680]  and destroy. And they're a 501c3. Now a church under 501c3 and it's fraudulent because you
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.520]  don't have to sign up with these things. You have your first amendment. Congress shall
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.720]  make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:00.640]  thereof. But, but a 501c3 isn't allowed to be involved politically, much less saying
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.680]  we're an arm of George Soros and the Democrats and we're going to destroy you. And papers
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:09.480]  are saying this is illegal. But I mean, here we are with Ron Paul and others fighting the
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:14.800]  banker takeover. And then we have George Soros openly with his attack dogs saying we will
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:22.080]  be destroyed. And they've got to be scared. Here we are on the hugely prestigious massive
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:29.360]  trade publication of talk radio, March 2011 talkers magazine. I'm on the cover and I'm
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:34.640]  the keynote speaker coming up in June. And this is where all the big corporate chiefs
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:39.000]  are going to be. What does it say that they want me there to speak to them? Well, they
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.600]  want me there to speak to them about why we're so successful. I'm going to tell them why
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:47.360]  because we tell the truth. But, but you know, the system, no wonder George Soros is so scared,
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.840]  Ted. Yeah, you're right about that. And you're and there's been a paradigm shift ever since
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.360]  the ever since the Tart bailouts. And we had Congress saying that we're going to have
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:02.520]  martial law here in the United States. People from the grassroots up are looking at what
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:06.640]  the United States government's doing and what the central banks are doing and what these
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.320]  world central banks are doing. And they're not liking it. And we're fighting back. And
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:17.800]  it's nice to see you succeed while some of these other neocon tight political people
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:24.640]  are dying on the vine. Our ratings are exploding. Internet, AM FM, new stations literally every
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.360]  couple days now back. And I'm kind of sad about it because overall, he does do some good,
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.760]  you know, exposing some things, dealing with the new world order, even if it's limited.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:38.800]  It's sad to see a year now straight. The new ratings came out a few days ago. He is in
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.880]  free fall, losing stations everywhere. But we're gaining stations. What does that tell
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:49.000]  you, Ted? Well, it just tells me what that the truth sells. You can't be an actor. You
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.960]  actually have to have your passion into it. You have to know what the real truth is. And
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.920]  then you have to keep telling it until people listen. I mean, look at how it was about 20
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:04.200]  years ago, or even 10 years ago when you got started 15, you know, it was like people thought
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.640]  you should be wearing a tin hat. Now you have everybody listening to you and radio stations
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.480]  are turning you on and television stations are looking at picking up your show. And it's
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:18.080]  not because I'm smart. When it's admitted that Al Qaeda was created by the globalist

[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:28.520]  shows you're right there people are not for this new war that was started by globalist
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:36.320]  special forces headed up with al-qaeda brigades brigades that form the core of the group starting
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.320]  the war against qaddafi remember five weeks ago qaddafi said this is al-qaeda working
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.840]  for the u.s. attacking me now it's all over the news nato admits yeah they're al-qaeda
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:48.600]  but they're good al-qaeda yeah they're out of Saudi Arabia yeah they're the same folks
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.200]  that were running around killing u.s. troops but so what if you're not for it you're anti
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:25:00.080]  america they actually say this is good this is humanitarian so i wanted to just remind
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:06.640]  you of your some history 1979 they create the muja hadeen to then attack russian outpost
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.640]  to elicit a full bore invasion brazil's key is now admitted all this we already knew it
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.600]  but now he's written two books on it they had a national security national security advisor
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:20.000]  at the time we're not saying the russians were good the point is this is what happened
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.480]  either is al-qaeda neither is the folks like brazil's key they're all corrupt they come
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:32.040]  in they attack then they use al-qaeda with the kla against the serbs in the equivalent
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:38.480]  of the u.s. southwest and the un comes in and bombs the north of Serbia bombs the central
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:44.000]  area of the south takes over the south ethnic cleansing of the serbs absolute murder all
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  confirmed loving liberal good just like the al-qaeda forces are killing anybody who they
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.880]  think may have ever supported qaddafi lining them up and shooting them it's confirmed it's
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:58.560]  freedom financial times in ap reported two days ago they abandoned all protests in official
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:04.800]  decree period you can't form new political parties women are raped if they protest you're
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:12.480]  shot and it's like our media is like yes freedom democracy that mubarak's gone kill everybody
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:21.200]  so that's going on it's just so over the top u.s. back forces european back forces were
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:26.400]  in there a week before the riots began months ago in egypt to overthrow their old puppet
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.200]  to get rid of the old dog put in some new dogs both the major candidates now running in the
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.640]  elections coming up that they went ahead and suspended but when the elections come back
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:40.320]  our western run publicly again total tyranny just mubarak was not evil enough just like
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:46.480]  saddam was not evil enough formally trained in 1958 when he was a iraqi army officer for
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:52.320]  three years in egypt by the cia that's all declassified in public got rid of him after
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.400]  they told him to launch wars against iran used al-qaeda against the serbs use them against
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:04.280]  the russians let's put it just google airlift of evil and the headline of the times of london
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:08.120]  it was also called that news recognition they said because these special forces colonel
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:11.880]  went public at the time in the services to chronicle they got a lot of trouble i remember
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.960]  the article it first came out there about a month before and then it finally came out
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:20.080]  in other publications they said look we captured thousand so it was an eight thousand taliban
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:25.520]  al-qaeda cream the leaders the taliban general bin laden's number two we were ordered you
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:31.520]  don't just load them on c 130's and take them to pakistan here are chest of gold chest
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:40.440]  of gold gold there it is msnbc the airlift of evil why did we let pakistan pull volunteers
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:46.920]  out of kunduz then you actually read the articles it wasn't pakistan it was usc 130's
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:54.240]  but see i'm evil i'm not for al-qaeda and oh it just continues here exclusive al-qaeda
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:01.600]  leader dined at the pentagon just months after 9 11 i keep going back to this fox news other
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.520]  publications pentagon didn't deny it it was just yes a lock he hangs out secretly at the
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:12.280]  pentagon while he's most wanted let's not discuss it and then he runs the attacks at
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:16.680]  fort hood and everywhere else just every one of the major attacks with moron patsy's they
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:23.120]  hired the real real mentally ill terrorist and they they turn these lunatics loose and
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.760]  then congress says let us see the two years of emails and meetings and pentagon surveillance
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:33.200]  of a locky controlling major hastan and the underwear bomber and others and they say sorry
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.080]  national security not going to give it to you because according to tarpley and his research
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:42.640]  in the evidence is there it's not even a locky it's the name a locky when they're out there

[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:23.000]  weeks ago using them as the core to get the revolution going now others have joined in
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.920]  and now it's admitted all over the news they are a like leatherman tool for the new world
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:33.080]  order that one size fits all and they use al-qaeda to menace the u.s. when they want
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:38.760]  to have more draconian crackdowns on our liberties and get hundreds of billions of no bid police
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:44.320]  state body scanner and face scanner and license plate scanner federalization funds of the
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.480]  private corporations but here's cbs news random letters and they're taking it like it's serious
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:57.440]  a hundred and sixty nuclear bombs buried by al-qaeda might as well be the kebler elves
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:00.720]  and we better give all our rights up because a hundred and sixty nukes are going to get
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:05.080]  us and you got all the white house and in democratic memos saying we need a new oklahoma
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:09.720]  city we need a new nine eleven to really take people's rights and make folks love it what
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:14.360]  are we going to do how are we going to prop up obama record approval rating plunging they
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.620]  think you're so down they're publicly talking about how great a staged event would be even
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:24.240]  becks covered this this is getting crazy i want to get into housing prices in areas
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:28.960]  that were seen as immune plunging general housing prices plunging commodities rocketing
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:34.240]  continually up breton woods to coming up next week run by soros at the breton woods hotel
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:39.080]  openly calling for the end of the dollar we're in a depression all the economic indicators
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:44.040]  are there but they're telling us that two plus two doesn't equal four they're saying it equals
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:48.600]  whatever they want because as crawl rose said they control reality well as long as we bow
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:52.600]  down to these con artists and let them put their spell on us they do but the minute we
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:57.760]  realize their potbellied scam artist it's over now bringing up gerald salente how to
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:02.040]  break this down to give us his take on the war all of it it's great to have you here
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:09.080]  with us my friend as we look at the war it's what we said it was going to be the first
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:13.880]  great war of the twenty-first century has begun and there could be no doubt about you
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:20.000]  said that two years ago how did you know well because of the global posse scheme is collapsing
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.440]  what happened was when the bailout bubble of the bailouts began in two thousand and
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:31.240]  eight we said when the bailout bubble bursts the next thing they'll do is take you to war
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:37.760]  its history repeating itself the song is the same the tune is different figure it out nineteen
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:44.320]  twenty nine the panic of our way the great depression the greatest recession the only
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:49.360]  reason the recession has in turn worse in the united states is because of all of that
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.600]  digital money that they keep pumping into the system to keep the banks afloat and then
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.840]  you look at the currency wars going on today hey guess what they went on back then the
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:05.400]  next thing is trade wars and then real wars so what we're looking at what's going on over
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:14.120]  in in in the middle east and north africa this is also going on actually in the uk you just
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:20.080]  saw what a half a million people take to the streets last week the only difference is back
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:26.680]  in the european countries as they're getting shafted they're still living under the illusion
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:32.800]  that they'll be able to change it at the ballot box they still believe in that but over in
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:38.480]  these other countries when you have dictatorial autocratic or or monarchs ruling they know
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:44.560]  that the only chances to overthrow that government and the globalist by increasing food prices
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:48.640]  via dollar devaluation knew the rebellions were starting so they started the dominoes
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:53.440]  going themselves to try to put their new people in and now in egypt the new government has
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:59.080]  banned all protest what do you make of this gerald salante fox news al qaeda leader died
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:04.200]  at the pentagon just months after 9 11 while he was on the most wanted list now and we're
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:09.360]  on a lock he's in the news saying arab revolts a boost for al qaeda that it's great what's
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.960]  happening in libya and the cia trained leader of the rebels admits the core of their troops
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:19.400]  are al qaeda so how do they have it both ways al qaeda bad give up all your rights so they'll
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:23.320]  get you in the night they're hiding under every bridge they're hiding in your closet
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:28.560]  under your bed under your table your coffee table but at the same time al qaeda good look
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:33.440]  am i an extremist that i don't like al qaeda are we wrong to not like al qaeda who is al
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:40.600]  qaeda well according to general patrice they're only what a hundred of them left in in afghanistan
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:45.000]  what we got over a hundred thousand troops over there you talk about overkill but hey
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.480]  they still can't find osama bin laden now they're gonna use you know the story they
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:55.760]  keep using fear to keep the military industrial complex alive look i you know i just i have
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:01.280]  to read this alex like unfortunately i had to watch all the president obama's speech
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:05.800]  the other night because i need to know you every detail that they're talking about that's
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:12.360]  very painful to watch this this show on the road but here's what he said i've made it
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:21.840]  clear that i will never hesitate to use our military swiftly decisively and unilaterally
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:31.760]  when necessary to defend our people our homeland so so far that's not too bad our allies and
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:39.240]  our core interests since when did this enter into the picture so in in effect he's abrogated
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:46.320]  the constitution he's unilaterally decided that whenever he believes what a core interest
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:54.240]  is like flourishing fields of broccoli and libya not their sweet crude oil then it's
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:40:04.660]  a excuse to intervene or our allies what allies hey how about that ally over there in Bahrain
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:10.800]  you know that guy that's killing his people don't talk about that one why not hey couldn't
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:18.360]  be because the fifth fleet is there alex they're getting us into war the wise the house and
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:24.120]  the ifs really don't make much of a difference because the story is gonna change like that
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:30.560]  how about this for a change of script really quick go back two weeks ago why did we get
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:39.760]  involved in libya i remember why they said because the arab league asked us oh you mean
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:47.600]  the arab little league where are they oh katar sending a couple of airplanes katar hey those
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:52.960]  are the people that own al jazeera right yeah that's right and haven't they been fermenting
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:41:02.200]  this war in in libya yeah and why hey couldn't be because in all of the public eye qaddafi
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:09.640]  and the emir over there had it out at an arab league meeting so we're getting dragged into
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:14.480]  this stuff and one more thing and i want to make this really clear you know how you hear
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:22.240]  all the time you know if only women were in charge we wouldn't be going to war i just
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:29.920]  read in the new york times that turlett paper a record as they would say in the Bronx that
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:35.840]  the three people pushing this war after the u.s. military didn't want to get into it in
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:45.000]  libya were none other than hillary clinton samantha powers is the national security and
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:53.600]  rice over there at the ambassador to the u.n. these are the three women that push this war
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:42:00.200]  so i'm tired of hearing this stuff that if only women were in charge so when we're looking
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:06.080]  at this war let's understand what it's really all about it's about the same reason why we're
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:15.920]  in afghanistan and in iraq all of the precious minerals and natural resources pipeline routes
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:22.720]  through afghanistan and iraq sitting on what the second largest oil reserves in the world
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:29.000]  and it's the same thing for libya people could care less about libya if it wasn't about the
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:37.760]  oil just like they don't care as we're speaking now the hypocrisy cannot be clearer 450 people
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:45.960]  killed in the ivory coast a million a million are fleeing their homes as a civil war is
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:53.400]  breaking out hey obama how about those human rights well gerald out the door well i mean
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:59.000]  gerald look the truth is bombing all of libya keeping the war going is going to exacerbate
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:05.400]  a humanitarian crisis but but but what about the orwellian level of the resolution saying
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:11.320]  it's not a war the pentagon saying it's kinetic military action the 2200 marines the thousands
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:15.880]  of british marines the marine commander saying we're getting ready to go in on the ground
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:20.960]  but it's going to be humanitarian we're only going to be advisors helping with transportation
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:31.080]  medicine and giving weapons to them so so now a bombing campaign is not a war now ground
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:37.520]  troops is not a war and we're not even hearing about fukushima whose reactor number two went
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:43.760]  into full meltdown and melted out of its container down into the ground water total chernobyl
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:52.520]  now and the government saying nothing to worry about i mean this is incredible howl obama
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:58.280]  i mean look they just abrogated all our rights where's the people rising up and standing
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:06.120]  up we just saw him on television saying he will do it with 22 eyes in his speech i wanted
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:11.480]  this i want that i believe this hey whatever happened to we the people and i want upset
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:16.760]  anybody now but i thought that was part of the whole deal no we the people don't count
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:24.440]  for anything you have these megalomaniacs running the white house running foreign policy and
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:30.720]  running the world whether it's soco the little american over there that little weenie cameron
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:36.840]  that little luck that little love eating boy over there in in the uk i'm sick and tired
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:44.480]  of these people getting us into war if they want to quote take out kadafi go do it man
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:50.440]  to man woman to woman we could balance the budget put it on pay per view everybody will
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.640]  love let's put a 50 pound pack on hillary and let her with a parachute jump out of an
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:59.720]  airplane over over triply if she's such a commando but but but going back to this you
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:06.200]  are going to need a big parachute with another 50 pounds on that but but but but i mean gerald
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:14.680]  looking at this obama as you said it's federal law it's the constitution he had to get authorization
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:21.920]  from congress they at least bush got a resolution from congress authorizing force it was still
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.080]  an illegal criminal war they've just dispensed with the congress having any power and the
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:33.240]  congress is servile other than ron paul and rand paul and are just saying great we will
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:36.560]  do whatever you say uh... derp hearer
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:42.360]  yet could uh... casinich also came out against it but you're right and then that's exactly
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:49.960]  what's going on and then read obama's statement i'm sure you have it back from 2007 december
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:55.320]  at the boston globe when he was asked about uh... what are the uh... the war powers he
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:59.560]  said congress should always be consulted the american people the president can't do this
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:04.600]  on his own biden said that he would impeach bush if he attacked iran without congressional
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.720]  authorization but now it doesn't matter and now all these liberals they're like in war
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:15.160]  right now they're feeling powerful you know that's that was what i was going to say next
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:21.600]  the wimper cracks are the worst that key sheeting grin and apple's sonic smile when their guy
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:28.680]  does it it's okay you know it's all right when obama does does it they'll make up any excuse
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:34.640]  if bush was in there now they'd be bashing bush you know they're more disgusting than
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:40.720]  anybody my line is conservatives believe liberals lie you know there are these wackos out there
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:46.560]  that say things like we got a bomber ran and get all their muslims dead i mean these people
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:52.080]  actually believe that the liberals have the intellectual capacity to know that they're
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:58.000]  lying to themselves they know the facts but they don't because they're with the cracks
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.760]  they have no spine to admit that they've been had and they're even more dangerous than the
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:10.640]  wackos because the wackos you know you can tell but the liberals you know they pretend
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:16.520]  to be saying now i want to get into some other areas but you did on the show
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:22.240]  i remember two years ago say that by 2011 or so it'll be clear that it's a depression
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:29.640]  that then they'll start a new war as a distraction what comes next then in your historical crystal
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:36.640]  ball we're concerned really about a whether it's a false flag or real a terrorist strike
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:40.760]  look everybody knows that kadoff he's you know he's a megalomaniac he's been in power
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:47.240]  for 42 years he said he's going to go out as a martyr so maybe before he goes out you
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:52.480]  know how about a little dirty bomb for parry or somebody and they'll love that there that
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:57.480]  will legitimize the police state legitimize the war in people's eyes or they could stage
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:04.560]  one and say he did it and now they're reporting 160 al-qaeda nukes in america with no proof
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:08.760]  oh yeah you're like they're all going to go off on it you know wednesday at seven thirty
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:13.400]  in the morning you know no it's all this stuff but they keep putting the fear card out there
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:21.160]  but the reality to alex is the united states the same day the same day the united states
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:27.480]  bombed libya and the headline read 25 dead in libya and it was a response from the libyans
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:35.960]  killing people 50 were killed over in yemen 38 from a one of those predator drones you
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:43.400]  know the united states likes to send over in pakistan that killed 38 innocent people
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:50.280]  you think there's any hatred and revenge how about what just happened again in afghanistan
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:56.240]  a number of civilians were wiped out little kids getting firewood but that's humanitarian
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:02.560]  that's humanitarian isn't it the hypocrisy you talk about genocide anybody forget about
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:08.480]  what the million people killed in a rock by the united states so what i'm saying is there
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:17.200]  is a lot of legitimate cause for a lot of people to want to want to have a revenge attack
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:24.040]  on the united states it doesn't have to be a false flag the next war we're going to see
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:31.240]  is going to be one of new of suitcase size nukes that we've been writing about the years

[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:10.720]  was very proud of the bombardment of all of syria with d u at least four times burk defects
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:16.520]  now in the country they're bombing libya with d u that has a four and a half billion year
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:23.560]  half life and it's deadly all of this is happening and uh... jerry solente mentioned cement the
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:28.520]  power the assistant to president obama she's cast sunsteen's wife the guy that says ban
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:33.000]  free speech in america publicly publicly says arrest people that he doesn't agree with
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:38.600]  total tyrants but they're liberal and the d u is liberal when they drop it she's not
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:42.920]  even american i love irish folks but i'm not over there running their country so many of
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:48.280]  these people running our government are foreigners she's irish hadn't even lived here that long
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:55.480]  and she's a warmonger and maybe they'll give her a uh... peace price uh... because she
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:55:01.800]  drops d u on people uh... gerald yeah well she will look i mean norway should be your
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:09.240]  orwell spell backwards for giving obama the peace prize and talking about peace and obama's
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:16.680]  stance when he made this speech i want to read this to brush aside america's responsibility
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:24.720]  as a leader and more profoundly our responsibilities to our fellow human beings under such circumstances
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:31.280]  meaning libya would have been a betrayal of who we are some nations may be able to turn
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:39.120]  a blind eye to atrocities in other countries the united states is different hey how about
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:45.440]  to those atrocities going on over there in saudi arabia and in Bahrain now let's look
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:53.760]  at this what if the soviet uh... russia putin decides that we're gonna bring democracy to
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:56:00.120]  saudi arabia we're going to give those women rights they have none now we're doing this
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:07.840]  because we're the great russian people how would americans respond to that one well that's
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:13.920]  how the new imperial invasion works they fund the people to rise up uh... then all we've
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:19.160]  got to go in and attack this country uh... because it's humanitarian grounds i mean this
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:24.360]  is so transparent what's happening yeah but again what would happen if russia went into
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:29.600]  saudi arabia what would happen if russia had gone into libya well that's like preemptive
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:34.840]  war that bush announced do other countries get to attack people first now because everybody
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:39.480]  always knew the bad guys attack first now the good guys attack first well does that mean
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:44.800]  everybody can attack their neighbor now does that mean saddam was good for attacking kawait
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:51.040]  not only america's good we're the only ones that are no good or no good now i want to
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:55.960]  shift gears hypocrisy as i said you know it's everywhere it is the facts of the facts and
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:00.200]  the facts are that people are getting slaughtered all over the world and when there's no money
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:04.360]  in it nobody cares now jerry only number five more minutes with you the next hour then we're
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:07.360]  going to your calls those that are holding on the fact that it is public that all god
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:11.960]  is being run by the u.s. government but going back to you gerald here in the end of the
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.040]  segment the next the economy what do you see happening there well you just you just read
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:22.480]  some of those housing statistics that came out the housing prices are down over thirty
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:28.160]  percent that's worse than great depression levels we're looking at what we're looking
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:34.560]  at volume that's going to last the years of empty homes this isn't going anywhere the
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:39.880]  only thing that's happened is that again you only go by the facts that this recovery was
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:47.680]  they said it from the beginning was to save the two big to fails they did it the rich
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:54.120]  scott richer and everybody else got poorer this isn't you know a line let's look at
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:58:04.200]  the facts ten percent of the population controls ninety percent of all of the stocks bonds
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:13.920]  and mutual funds five percent of the population controls sixty five percent of all the wealth
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:21.080]  you'll look at the numbers look at christmas sales when they happen where was the big increase
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:30.600]  the luxury items the posse scheme is collapsing made off had an interview in new york magazine
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:36.600]  in february twenty seven out of this whole piece of garbage there were two lines worth
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:43.200]  listening stay there give us those lines when we come back in one minute thank you for listening
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:55.040]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:59.680]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:04.320]  two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:09.920]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:15.120]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:20.320]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:24.520]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:29.160]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:33.320]  backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:37.640]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:43.400]  at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:48.160]  doesn't own the sun should go to my solar backup dot com or call one eight seven seven
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:58.200]  three two seven zero three six five waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio
[01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:13.320]  network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:23.000]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones jerald
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:27.760]  i remember when we first started interviewing you about four years ago you said the next
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:33.640]  big bubble to pop was education now you were called in a paranoid then now the mainstream
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:39.240]  media the big hot thing is admitting that it's a big scam a ripoff nine die in alabama
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:45.120]  hospital because of infected iv bags hundreds of thousands die a year because of hospital
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:50.760]  problems bad drug interactions but we've got to give all our rights up because the terrorist
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:56.200]  might attack us but the real terrorists are the people that created the nasdaq like burning
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:01.240]  made off but even a crook like him can tell the truth tell folks what he said well he
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:05.960]  said two things that stuck in my mind one was that he said as soon as i got into the
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:12.880]  business i learned right away you had to be on the inside and the game is rigged the game
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:18.960]  is rigged that's bernie's words and he should know gabish it's rigged it's a suckers bet
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:26.760]  number two and this goes back to where the economy is going he said the government is
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:33.680]  one big ponzi scheme the king of ponzi should know about a ponzi scheme and that's what
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:40.320]  this is the global ponzi scheme is collapsing that's why you're seeing all of these revolts
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:47.840]  going on and as i said when all else fails they take you to war look what's going on
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:55.280]  over in europe with the european monetary union portugal's toast greek is greeks are
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:01.840]  cooked again you tarply and countless other real economist researchers experts years ago
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:07.760]  named the countries greece then ireland then portugal then spain then france then germany
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:14.880]  then england then the u.s but instead the bankers are posing as the saviors for the crisis that
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:21.280]  they've created and now the headlines are e you collapsing exactly as we knew it would
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:27.280]  begin to exactly so here's what they've done that make this very simple they keep pushing
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:32.680]  this money out to their buddies as we saw with the the reporting from the one time reporting
[02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:37.800]  from dod frank and and we found out twenty trillion dollars worth of federal money here's
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:44.320]  the way it works europe bank here alex his twenty billion dollars get it back out into
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:48.400]  the system you can give me twenty billion yet don't worry about it no interest you're my
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:53.120]  pal when do i pay you back don't worry about it just get that money out there keep the
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:58.240]  damn game going and they give it to germany they give it to switzerland they give it to
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:04.720]  france they give it to general electric and you saw those numbers that came out how much
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:10.840]  tax did general electric pay you know so this is what they're doing they're keep pushing
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:17.000]  this money and the EU is doing the same thing the master agreement it ain't worth nothing
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:22.680]  listen i have an employee who gets paid decent money has great credit had a bank account
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:28.240]  with jp morgan chase for seven years he went in to get a little car loan and they were
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:32.920]  rude to him and the banker told him you get nothing and the hundreds of billions they've
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:37.200]  gotten in the bailout money it goes to their bonuses and they've caught lending when they're
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:42.040]  supposed to loan it out they're hoarding it all because the worst the economy gets the
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:46.960]  more they can buy up everything you got it and you look at the merger and acquisition
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:53.640]  uh... uh... uh... action going on now it's increased you know what i say these guys are
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:59.560]  no more than money junkies they can't get enough and they want everything that you have
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:04.280]  and and they don't care if you're dying or you're dead they're gonna grab it from you
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:09.920]  look with it talking about dying a dead they want to increase now the the retirement age
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:15.440]  till after you're dead how's that that'll work just fine by the way in closing fake conservatives
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:19.640]  all over talk radio say don't do anything the banks they're free market no they're getting
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:24.040]  government welfare they're running the government and i'm so sick of these fake conservatives
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:28.720]  lying to their listeners and and and and saying the bankers are good
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:32.160]  on how about this one in talking about balancing the budget
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:37.400]  hey yeah let's start another war we keep detroit isn't worth anything anymore
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:42.560]  let's you know spend a couple hundred million dollars a day on another losing war
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:45.880]  where are the conservatives there

[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:12.440]  proves how important food is our own gas prices are driving food costs through the roof the
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:18.320]  huge population countries are buying up american unprotected exports of food the falling dollars

[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:35.520]  john jesse george perry and others that have been patiently holding because before uh
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:43.600]  jelce lindsay always informative joined us i was getting into newsweek fox ap new york
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:48.640]  time showing you the articles where the fbi cooks the bomb trains the driver lets him
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:53.960]  bomb the world trade center the first time uses al-qaeda against the serbs when the serbs
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:09:00.920]  fight back nato bombs him with du six weeks ago cia sending in people to lead al-qaeda
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:06.200]  against the secular uh... mark adafi and we're all lucky back in the news saying he's going
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:09.960]  to get us give all your rights up course he directly hangs out at the pentagon al-qaeda
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:14.360]  leader died at the pentagon just months after nine eleven fox news and now they're saying
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:19.560]  one hundred sixty nukes are buried in america about to go off and their proof is a letter
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:24.400]  was mailed in we're going to your calls in a moment but first threats claim nuclear bombs
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:29.240]  hidden all over u s actually i guess i you could write a letter i don't recommend it
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:32.280]  would be a terrific threat fact don't do it but the point is hypothetically you could
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:37.000]  write a letter saying there are five thousand foot leprechauns buried a hundred and sixty
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.880]  locations that are fire breathing and are going to dig out of the ground and start attacking
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:46.960]  a hundred and sixty cities next thursday uh... and you can send the letter in homeland security
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:51.920]  and they'd come out and say uh... one hundred and sixteen uh... multi thousand foot leprechauns
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:56.080]  that fire laser beams out of their eyes uh... and lightning bolts come out of their uh...
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:59.960]  other regions and they're they're gonna sit on your building and fire lightning bolts
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:03.160]  into it i have a letter came in it must be true
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:05.680]  remember the college students have a cisco six years ago
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:08.160]  did a fake beheading for a week it was real al-qaeda
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:13.880]  because the media is prime you always see a p new bin laden email new uh... a locky email
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:17.240]  it'll just say at the bottom they'll say it's all facts for two pages a little
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:21.880]  little proviso at the bottom uh... we can't confirm this is real is on a message board
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:25.160]  i mean i could go on my message board and say i am a silent bin laden
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:28.920]  i am going to land in a flying saucer tomorrow i mean it it's just
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:31.280]  but here it is all my gosh give all your rights up
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:32.920]  there's a hundred and sixty nukes
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:36.400]  and the globalist may detonate one i've seen that the cards for a long time
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:39.680]  they may actually have some buried it'll be there and we're all lucky that did it
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:42.920]  but then no one will do that question well why is he hanging out the pentagon
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:45.040]  what why is al-qaeda working for the pentagon
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:47.240]  why is the c i running the attacks
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:49.160]  it'll just be shut up you want american
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:52.560]  but i'm like i have all the articles it's it they don't deny it shut up
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:54.320]  everybody knows a locky

[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:17.040]  charles lindy was talking about the three women uh... Samantha powers rice and
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:18.040]  then uh...
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:19.160]  hillary clinton
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:21.720]  guess who cast some scenes married to
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:25.400]  Samantha powers could you imagine living in that house
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:28.600]  well they're liberals though so it's good to drop to you on countries and that
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:30.720]  she's not even american running things
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:34.200]  and cast on stein says arrest people he disagrees with that's liberal
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:37.520]  i mean even new york magazine praise demon basically said this is how you
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:40.840]  deal with alex jones i mean maybe cast has got a point
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:45.160]  and that's the way our government's run it's not it's not run by our elected
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:50.120]  representatives who are public servants it's a lot it's run by these bureaucrats
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:54.920]  who don't care about what the constitution says they just implement uh...
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:59.960]  their their own rules and legislation with a regardless of whether uh...
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:04.240]  our state local or uh... federal elected representatives
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:07.640]  uh... wanted done and there's a name for that it's called
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:09.400]  tyrants

[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:35.840]  uh... over the telecommunications infrastructure
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:40.400]  the scariest thing about that technology is it's
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:41.880]  manufactured
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:43.960]  and serviced by

[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:26.200]  because that's what this country's all about being completely run by foreigners
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:29.440]  and it's the scariest part about all of it is
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:33.480]  televieve company has the ability to not only see what we say and do but what
[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:35.240]  all of our law enforcement
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:38.200]  does and plans so if you were
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:41.840]  uh... you know some terrorist organization
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:46.400]  and we all know that al-qaeda is run by the pentagon and probably our buddies
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:48.360]  over in uh... in israel
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:51.240]  if we were if they wanted to plan false flag
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:56.400]  uh... terrorist activities they know exactly what all of our local and state
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:17:01.000]  uh... and federal law enforcement agents are doing where they are how did i mean
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.880]  they know all of our plans
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:04.680]  so when it comes to
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:07.400]  you know implementing their agenda
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:10.160]  they know everything that our law enforcement's doing
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:14.200]  notice very scary thing about the way tone communications is going to vote
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:16.040]  you've heard about four g and
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:17.240]  ltd
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:22.080]  well alex the scary thing about this network is it is an i p based
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:25.040]  network yeah tracks exactly where you are
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:29.080]  that ties into the gps tracking coordinates and they can dial in
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:32.760]  over the nineteen ninety six telecommunications act with the onboard spy
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:35.280]  chip to turn the phones and devices on
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.520]  and listen to you and watch you
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:40.400]  and it doesn't use standard cable and pair
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:42.280]  from the central office
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:45.920]  it to your home it uses the internet as the backbone
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:47.360]  so just like the
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:50.160]  uh... president and uh...
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:53.560]  you know everyone else in in congress now seems to want this internet kill
[02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:54.320]  switch
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:56.320]  it's not just going to kill
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:00.480]  your internet would you know it's the phones everything and that's why they
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:01.160]  say
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:04.080]  obama will pop up on your smartphone with announcements
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:07.040]  if you go to walmart the telescreens they're all they're going to be in your
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:07.760]  life
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:13.160]  they admit forcing their way in front of you and surveilling everything you do
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:17.040]  exactly scary thing to ask you ever play that game risk when you were growing
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.960]  up yes word game yes well
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:23.960]  you would always put your most all your pieces around your most valuable
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:28.040]  uh... territories will look at the with gender that the globalist half
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:31.560]  if you were going to try to take over the united states what would you do
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:34.760]  you first of all you disarm all the general public
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:37.960]  you take control of the monetary system take control of education
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:39.720]  take control of telecommunications
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:41.320]  surveil everyone
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:44.400]  every major professional i talked to is being approached by homeland security
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:45.760]  to spy on everyone
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:50.000]  the the u.s is completely converting to a nightmare system
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.920]  but look what's going on in in new york and california the people are going to be
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:54.800]  broke
[02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:57.880]  this bill state local governments are going to be broke so there's not going
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:58.740]  to be any
[02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:02.720]  uh... what is reached out excuse me forty three states are now going
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:05.880]  publicly under receivership under the feds
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:08.800]  yes and then the people are going to be starving to death
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:12.480]  and then because our military is so spread out around the whole world
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:17.280]  alex i don't think that this nation any longer is immune to attack
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:21.560]  by a foreign force i think that we are going to be so broke
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:23.640]  monetarily morally
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:25.880]  uh... we're going to be starving to death
[02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:28.640]  and look at the two coasts of this country
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:30.600]  are going to be so
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:33.280]  so i mean that the populations are fleeing
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:37.160]  from new york and california look at the numbers the populations of these
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:39.000]  coastal states are just
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.280]  other running from the socialism and then is the collapse into depression
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:46.080]  the giant hordes of lazy welfare heads
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:49.440]  are going to be turned into auxiliary police with automatic weapons robbing
[02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:50.600]  stealing everything
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:54.200]  while george soros sits offshore laughing with pleasure

[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:13.600]  globalist have when they execute an implosion of a of an economy it
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:16.320]  normally goes into a worse tyranny and that's what they've been setting up
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:20.920]  lovingly and so we are headed into very dark times but if we're able to
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:25.160]  pre-position the info warned people it's not going to go well for the globalist
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:29.240]  so we're going to race to get the word out John in South Carolina you're on the
[02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:34.760]  year worldwide hey Alex hey how you doing just want to thank you for everything
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:41.280]  you do and my wife and I woke up about a year ago and you know we went out and
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:45.040]  purchased your DVDs and now we're trying to wake up as many people as we
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:50.880]  possibly can one of the things I wanted to discuss with you is the state of the
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:59.320]  economy and it's a blatant manipulation of the of the of the markets you know
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:06.840]  where the common person can't really you know be able to take advantage of you
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:11.520]  know the market runs well yeah because it's I mean it's a red casino it's like
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:14.480]  going to Las Vegas and trying to win I mean you might win three times out of
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:19.840]  ten but in the aggregate you're gonna lose and and they use Wall Street's
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:23.840]  health and the health of overall stock prices is the only barometer of the
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:29.320]  economy it's completely false yeah absolutely yeah absolutely I trade
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:36.000]  futures and commodities full-time and I'll tell you I you look at the charts
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:40.440]  and you see what they do on a daily basis and it's just amazing you know the
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:46.040]  other day markets went you know straight up and you know today they come out with
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:51.080]  a ADP report where they added two hundred one thousand jobs out of no thin
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:55.520]  air and you know it's just so blatant they're not even trying to even cover
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:00.680]  it up anymore and one of the other things too as I'm trying to educate people
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:06.160]  about the Federal Reserve and and how it how it operates and one of the books
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:13.160]  that I picked up was by Ellen Hodgson web of debt and I use also the secret of
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:19.000]  Oz bill stills video and excellent resource on you know the system and
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.840]  and and how they use it against us and by the way we're in a race to wake up the
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:26.560]  general public because if we don't explain to them what's really happening
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:30.920]  the globalists are going to pose as the saviors and the crisis they created and
[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:36.800]  and clamped down on us even more every person you wake up especially pastors
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:43.080]  police chiefs mayors county commissioners school board bankers the more
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:46.760]  people you wake up and the more people that see that you're awake then they
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:51.800]  feel safe in coming out themselves for freedom we're in a race against the
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:57.920]  globalist I cannot stress that enough yeah and one more thing is that you know
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:01.920]  at the federal level trying to combat this at the federal level I really don't
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:06.560]  think that you know we as an average citizen that's really stand a chance I
[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:10.920]  think I think what we should do is basically try to combat this at the
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:15.080]  state level that's why the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says that
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:17.840]  they'll take over the states if governors try to do what the people say
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:21.080]  you're absolutely right that's the 10th Amendment 9th Amendment remedy that's
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:26.120]  what they're scared of we've got to have a dual fight to expose the feds as
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:30.160]  illegitimate run by foreign bankers take the states back it's beginning to
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:33.960]  happen great job appreciate your call great points Jesse and Louisiana you're
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:38.520]  on the air thanks for holding hey Alex before I get into it I just wanted to
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:42.360]  I guess illustrate my qualifications I'm a veteran I've been in the war for
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:48.680]  70 years I've fallen Afghanistan Iraq Africa and we conducted a lot of field
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:53.600]  studies regarding suicide bombers extremist culture for certain prevention
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:58.320]  that kind of stuff and the first thing that really got me looking at this
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:05.040]  situation in Libya and then now here with these letters they use the exact same
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:09.720]  verbiage about going in a war in Afghanistan even before 9-11 I'm looking
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:14.680]  at an article now from June of 2001 where they were talking about quote limited
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:19.800]  military action which is exactly the same terms they use in going in Olivia of
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:27.600]  course now it's kinetic action but and in dealing with these letters I mean you
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:31.960]  first all you have to just look at the employability of the whole story I mean
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:37.240]  there's so many controls around nuclear weapons the thought that they could go
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:42.440]  unaccounted for for the time it would take to get the material build it
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:47.040]  distribute it place it write the letters send them out nobody saw this
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:53.040]  material missing yet I mean before the plus even Russian and US built frogs or
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:57.360]  small tax a lot of times didn't even work because they're so delicate but
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:01.600]  we're to believe Al Qaeda placed and never got caught in 160 missions
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:08.200]  burying nukes it's a lot of material to not be noticed I mean I don't know I
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:11.680]  mean I know in that plutonium or whatever went missing up in Vancouver
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:18.320]  before the Olympics everybody knew about that as soon as it happened sir to say
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:22.920]  that I'll I mean to hype that Al Qaeda has 160 nukes buried in government
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:27.320]  buildings I mean that's that that is completely impossible it's very
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:33.440]  impossible unless it's an inside job well that's got to be but I mean hold on
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:37.000]  I got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up but for one minute we come back I want
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:40.280]  to ask you as a seasoned military veteran what do you think about Al Qaeda
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:44.000]  always being protected by the Pentagon and and we're all lucky hanging out at
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:47.360]  the Pentagon we're getting Roberts on now but I want to have you answer that
[02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:51.680]  question then I'm gonna ask him the question on the other side we're on the
[02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:59.800]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:06.200]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:10.760]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:14.720]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:19.400]  turned in this influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:24.000]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.360]  citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:33.640]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:37.960]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:41.440]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:46.680]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:52.680]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at

[02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:07.320]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:11.360]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:15.240]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:19.240]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:19.240 --> 02:31:23.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:27.800]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:31:27.800 --> 02:31:31.600]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:35.280]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:39.600]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:42.760]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:24.000]  moment and we're gonna get to George Perry Robert Jasper at least while
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.600]  Roberts is on with us but I want to get Robert's take on his new article
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:31.440]  published at info wars.com many other places about Obama takes the US to new
[02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:37.040]  levels of hypocrisy will also get his expertise on the housing numbers that
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:40.440]  are coming out and the fact that the feds monetizing more and more of the debt
[02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:45.440]  and now he sees the Japan crisis tying into all that former head of policy
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:49.520]  Department of Treasury father of ergonomics no stranger to this show but
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:54.480]  but Jesse I threw the question out with the head of NATO admitting that yes Al
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:59.560]  Qaeda was the first group the core group attacking Muammar Gaddafi and we're all
[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:02.880]  a locky hanging out secretly at the Pentagon but back in the news today
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:07.800]  menacing us the underwear bomber he controlled the US agents helping get the
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:12.640]  underwear bomber on the plane I mean is the military aware of the fact that
[02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:16.200]  sure there's some useful idiot ground Islamists that really believe they're
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:21.440]  g-hotting but the leadership of these guys is basically tied into this corporate
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:26.600]  crime syndicate and is being used to attack the Serbs attack Gaddafi to
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:30.120]  menace the US into giving up our liberties I mean what's your view on that
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:36.680]  as a veteran well I know I know for a fact you know when when you're when
[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:41.160]  you're in a leadership position and you're and you're told to do stuff you
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:45.440]  know you're put you got blinders on and and it's all you can do to just do what
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:49.840]  you're told and get through whatever it is we have to get through but I mean we
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:53.680]  were very frustrated on the ground especially in Afghanistan because no
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:59.040]  matter where we would go that was like Al Qaeda was like a phantom it was like
[02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:05.760]  this mystery boogeyman that like we would go to villages and we would be
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.080]  told in our intelligence reports or you're the first Americans to ever go
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:13.480]  in this area and we'd get there and we'd see like MRE trash on the ground and
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:16.560]  people would be like you know our interpreters would talk to the locals
[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:19.680]  and they'd be like oh yeah there's some white guys here like two hours ago and
[02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:26.600]  like yeah it's a wild goose chase and the Times of London reports thousands of
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:30.840]  Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders that were caught in 2001 2002 were ordered to be
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:36.520]  released and then paid did you guys know about that yeah well we didn't we
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:40.400]  don't we don't receive any information we're so busy and over there doing what
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:44.800]  we're doing I mean there were some times when we get on you know get to see the
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:49.880]  news and we'd see Geraldo or somebody on there talking about something that never
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:55.040]  even happened like on missions that we were on and just completely fabricating
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:59.080]  being attacked and getting contact with the enemy and everything and and we were
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:02.280]  just told you know oh well don't worry about that that's just you know that's
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:08.680]  just news speak and blah blah blah but I mean it was just like no matter what
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:12.520]  misinformation was being put out there it was just you know oh just do your job
[02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:17.240]  and be a good soldier and you know we'll take care of the American people well
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:22.480]  that's it Al Qaeda is a phantom chess piece that they put on the map wherever
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:26.680]  they want to invade or they have Al Qaeda attack the Serbs attack Gaddafi and
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:30.920]  then humanitarian bombing and they're now admitting yeah we're gonna land troops
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:35.160]  but it's gonna be humanitarian back up to the rebels and then they admit to find
[02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:39.440]  print they were there months ago setting the whole thing up it's incredible God
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:43.320]  bless you sir I appreciate your call I wanted to basically ask that question of
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:49.360]  the Afghanistan Iraq veteran as I then pose it to you Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:55.880]  because now I'm finally going on big national conservative shows and main
[02:36:55.880 --> 02:37:00.000]  line big hosts are saying you're right Alex I guess it is true Al Qaeda is a
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:04.280]  creation of the Pentagon and you're right it's all staged so I really think
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:09.560]  they've gone too far Dr. Roberts what's your take on this well Alex I can't
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:19.760]  claim to know I my own opinion is that the wall carry is a hoax and it's a
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:25.560]  cover for undeclared agendas I don't know what all those agendas are have some
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:31.160]  idea about what some of them might be and I also suspect that Al Qaeda is a
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:38.720]  hoax that it that there's really no such thing other than something that the
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:46.360]  yaa is created as part of this undeclared agenda but I don't know I don't
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:55.040]  have any inside information and anyone who does doesn't tell me but I've been
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:59.080]  suspicious of this war terrorists at the beginning because I remember a
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:03.640]  neighbor calling me when the building the World Trade Center towers were being
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:08.920]  attacked and the Trump TV and I turned it on if you may remember they showed
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:14.000]  over and over the buildings coming down and I could see the buildings weren't
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.400]  falling down they were blowing up obviously were blowing up and so I've
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:25.160]  always wondered of that and the other thing that made me think as a whole was
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:32.200]  that if the official story is correct and and a few Saudi Arabians pulled this
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:38.840]  off it's the most massive government failure in world history it's never
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:46.000]  been such a coordinated total failure of every aspect of the government you know
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:51.160]  not you know all the intelligence agents nor at air traffic control airport
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:57.680]  security the Pentagon everything fail but such a perfect execution by guys
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:01.480]  directed from caves doctor can you wait wait wait let me get the real part
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:09.240]  sure for you that if this was actually true it happened and the the president
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:13.680]  the National Security Council the CIA the Congress would all be demanding to
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:16.560]  know how in the world could this have happened I could so many people fail
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:21.760]  they would have insisted immediately on an investigation just to find out how
[02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:25.840]  our systems could totally fail and heads would have rolled somebody would have
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:32.160]  been held accountable and yet they resisted all investigation into no
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:38.040]  heads ever rolled or what the government says is the most massive failure of
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:44.360]  government human history so these things make me and then what also makes me
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:49.360]  suspicious is all this hypocrisy we see all of a sudden now we're concerned
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:55.400]  about humanitarian death in Libya well why aren't we concerned about all the
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:40:00.440]  ones we inflict I mean we you know we wrecked Iraq for what seven or eight
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:04.960]  years that we've been wrecking Afghanistan what is it now for almost ten
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:12.680]  years we never say a word when the Israelis wrecked Lebanon and wrecked
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:20.720]  Gaza and we don't say a word about all the deaths and Bahrain or Yemen we
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:27.720]  routinely kill people in Pakistan with drones we force the Pakistani army to
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:32.320]  attack its own people its own tribes and all of a sudden now we have
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:37.040]  humanitarian concern in Libya so it doesn't really make any sense you know
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:41.000]  what I mean and if you can just see it doesn't make any sense and so you
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:46.840]  figure that there's some agenda going on and they're not telling us what it is
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:50.840]  yes sir do me a favor you're coming through pretty good but perhaps if you're
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:55.680]  using a headset or a regular phone just speak directly into it Dr. Paul Greg
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:58.600]  Roberts we really want to hear what you have to say but I mean here's a piece of
[02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:03.280]  evidence Al Qaeda leader dying at the Pentagon just months after 9-11 while he
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:08.280]  was you know a wanted man on the news and Amaral Alaki is involved in all these
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:12.000]  domestic attacks he's on the news menacing us we're now told he's the
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:17.040]  head guy under bin Laden shouldn't there be an investigation on why he was
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:20.840]  hanging out the Pentagon with having dinner with the Secretary of the Army
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:25.240]  and the top brass if he's such a deadly Al Qaeda commander well you would
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:31.680]  think so yes you know you know another giveaway Alex I think we've talked about
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:37.800]  this before is all of the terror cases with them all the terror take domestic
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:44.880]  terror cases they're all orchestrated by FBI so what is the FBI have to go to
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:54.880]  such extremely to ensnare people who are not inclined to be terrorists into
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:42:02.200]  some fabricated terrorist act so that they can actually have a real case I
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:05.360]  mean if we're overrun by terrorists you'd think there would be everywhere
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:08.880]  the government wouldn't have to be spending all this time and money trying
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:14.720]  to create terrorists out of people who aren't and every one of these cases that
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:24.840]  have gone to court have been terrorism organized by the FBI so again this tells
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:34.960]  you that there's really no Al Qaeda that the FBI has to go out and mimic it so we
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:39.720]  know the results of war in police state so we have to figure that to the
[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:46.280]  agenda yes sir shifting gears into your latest article dealing with Obama taking
[02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:49.800]  America to new heights of hypocrisy you've already hit on some of that but
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:56.560]  in my 16 and a half 17 years you're studying this 24-7 and looking at it
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:43:01.320]  I've never seen you as soon as you think Clintons are well in and then Bush's are
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:05.440]  well in and now Obama they say don't call it a war it's a kinetic military
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:10.840]  action don't call dropping DU bombs military now we learn they did arm the
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:15.080]  rebels beforehand Al Qaeda is involved now they've got the Marines saying yeah
[02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:18.960]  we're gonna land and the British Marines but it's going to be backing up the
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:23.080]  rebels so it's not a military action and there's not gonna be a ground war but we
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:30.120]  are gonna be on the ground I mean it's it it's it's beyond 1984 why are they so
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:35.400]  arrogant now because they've gotten away with it no one's been held accountable
[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:41.560]  and you know the Bush regime well Clinton got away with it in Serbia right
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:47.760]  bombing people and then the Bush regime got away with a flagrant violations of
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:55.120]  statutory US law I mean he didn't have it wasn't something simple I expect with
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:44:01.720]  an intern I mean he created massive numbers of felony under the law and and
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:08.240]  so Bush had been arrested prosecuted in prison and any number of the members of
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:14.280]  the administration they're all criminal under American law and yet nothing there
[02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:20.080]  was even a protest about it you know you the violation of the foreign intelligence
[02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:25.520]  surveillance act is a felony for every effect there's a felony for how many
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:32.280]  millions of wiretaps did they make your torture is a felony under the United
[02:44:32.280 --> 02:44:38.200]  States law and yet Bush can write in his autobiography or his memoirs or
[02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:44.240]  whatever that he ordered it and that he would you know was proud to do it and so
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:50.800]  if there's no accountability they can just do whatever and they now use the
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:59.920]  word in ways that are just obviously but such distortion if we now have them
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:06.320]  we're going to have troops on the ground but it's not troops on the ground so it's
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:11.840]  incredible I mean you study history as you've done this megalomania always sets
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:16.640]  in and I think that will be their undoing is that they've gone so power
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:22.320]  mad and pride goes before a fall hubris goes before a fall the problem is this
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:26.880]  thousand-foot edifice is going to fall on us when it falls how do you see this
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:31.120]  ending and then let's go through some of the hypocrisy and what you think they're
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:35.960]  in game is I don't know what they're in game is and I don't stand why they're
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:42.080]  taking these massive risk with the economy with the dollar you know the
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:48.640]  whole thing could explode at any time and unless they have some kind of I don't
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:52.640]  don't think they've got the whole world under their thumb so I don't see I don't
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:57.720]  know I don't know why they don't see the risk you know we have these massive
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:46:03.320]  budget deficits that are getting worse because it's no recovery and there's no
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:08.680]  way to finance them except by printing money well how long can you print a new
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:13.640]  trillion and a half dollars every year before the dollar disappears as a
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:19.600]  currency you can't do that very long it's just and if they say oh we're gonna
[02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:23.440]  stop printing the money we don't take all the money back out which is what
[02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:27.680]  vernacular you said well they can't do that without sending the interest rates
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:33.840]  you know all into the universe but the whole economy would just collapse well
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:36.520]  doctor I don't know what they're doing I don't know what they're doing what
[02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:41.040]  they're not thinking unless it's some kind of agenda agenda we don't know
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:44.960]  about they make sense of all this but I can't figure out what it would be well
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:48.640]  doctor I mean you were the guy you ran the Treasury Department the head of
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:52.560]  policy or you know listed by many major publications as one of the top 10 living
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:58.200]  economists stuff you predicted five six years ago on this show is now happening
[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:02.400]  the monetization of debt is accelerating all of this is happening
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:06.400]  inflation is ringing its head in some areas but the overall depression is
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:12.040]  putting the brakes on that and there and now the meltdown of Europe into
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:18.480]  Portugal Spain is beginning I mean where does this end well in
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:23.640]  catastrophe you see but look Alex there's already been mass inflation food
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:28.760]  prices haven't reflected it yet but the cereal grains have gone up
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:37.720]  tremendously you know at 30 40 50 100% some of them when that works its way
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:42.200]  through the food processing companies everybody's gonna see big jumps in
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:50.120]  prices and and when when that hit the first time they can no longer hide the
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:55.320]  inflation in the way they rig the consumer price index the first time
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:59.320]  there's really a sign of inflation what do you think will happen to interest
[02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:05.720]  rates because all the bonds are set are so highly priced now the interest rates
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:11.840]  are practically zero and a lot of people remaining wealth is in bond because they
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:17.480]  know the stock market is being driven by money creation well once those interest
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:24.440]  rates move up the bond prices are gonna collapse and whatever's left of private
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:30.760]  wealth will be right so I don't know I don't think there's any style and and we
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:34.760]  could say well the agenda is to destroy everything but why would people with power
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:40.480]  want to destroy the basis of their power so I can't believe that it either and it
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:47.880]  may just be what you said it's hubris it's the belief that they're they're
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:55.960]  omnipotent and so powerful that nothing they do can come back to buy them maybe
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:49:05.440]  that's the craziness or it's just the short-term greed driven profit driven
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:12.080]  oligarchy you know there are very few ruling economic elite is Wall Street the
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:17.560]  military security complex the oil industry they may all be focused on
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:22.560]  such short-run profit we're gonna steal everything we can and we're gonna be
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:27.240]  rich and maybe they think they can do that and get out of the dollar before
[02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:31.520]  it goes but if you look at all those profits all those people have they try
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:36.800]  to get out of dollars that's like China and Japan and OPEC trying to get out of
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:42.960]  the ball at the same time so it just can't happen I just don't know Alex I
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:49.040]  have no idea other than how do you avoid the catastrophe well they they knew this
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:53.160]  Ponzi scheme would lead to this and so they're racing to get as much as they
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:57.160]  can before it collapses and George Soros as I'm sure you know in four days is
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:00.640]  gonna be here five days is gonna be meeting back at Bretton Woods openly
[02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:04.240]  calling for a new international order he's got all these big wigs coming in
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:09.080]  so I think they plan to poses the saviors and bring in a new level of
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:12.640]  bubble but many economists I've talked to just say that things are still so
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:16.840]  based in US bonds that you can't transition quickly to something new
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:22.120]  because it will radically deteriorate quickly as well yes I don't think they
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:27.880]  can transition and one reason I don't think they can I don't think China will
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:32.000]  cooperate I don't think Brazil will cooperate I don't think Russia will
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:39.680]  cooperate I just don't see how they can transition and and I don't think you can
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:45.600]  create a new world order by closing everybody's lose confidence in you if we
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:49.160]  wanted to do something like that we should have behaved quite differently and
[02:50:49.160 --> 02:50:54.600]  made everybody feel secure and confident that our leadership may spin
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:59.160]  and was found and that people could understand what we were doing but instead
[02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:06.320]  we've had all these senseless war a massive cost resulting in massive
[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:10.240]  deficits it can't be financed except by pruning money the whole world does this
[02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:16.080]  so I just you know we have the puppet states of Europe we can get them to do
[02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:21.800]  what we want we have the puppet state of Canada and Australia we've been trying
[02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:25.560]  to create a few puppet states out of former specific parts of the Soviet
[02:51:25.560 --> 02:51:35.520]  Union such as Georgia and the Ukraine but that's not enough and we're in the
[02:51:35.520 --> 02:51:42.200]  process it appears of losing some of our Middle Eastern puppet states I mean I
[02:51:42.200 --> 02:51:47.000]  don't think the CIA is behind all of these revolts in all these countries
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:50.240]  now they're trying to steer them but but let me throw this point in at you
[02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:54.280]  because I think it backs up your point about it being hubris and and and they
[02:51:54.280 --> 02:51:58.800]  think they're in control but they're really not in control and I think that's
[02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:02.560]  evidence by Fukushima they've now had complete meltdown at reactor two it's
[02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:05.880]  melted down through the floor they could blow up like Chernobyl anytime many
[02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:09.280]  physicists nuclear physicists we've had on have said this is already far worse
[02:52:09.280 --> 02:52:13.280]  than Chernobyl and our government says it's no problem the Japanese government
[02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:17.680]  it turns out it's been covering things up why did they build it on a fault line
[02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:21.120]  why did they store the spent rods on top the reactors I mean that's another
[02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:28.880]  example of just these people just just just always doing it in the most
[02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:34.000]  flimsy way they can and it just shows an overall breakdown of common sense and
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:38.240]  no long-term view by the global ruling elite I mean they're just a bunch of
[02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:51.080]  nutcases well that's that's I agree with that yeah I think that and they had a bunch of liars everything they say is a lie and I
[02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:59.880]  think you do that we have not cases ruling and they lie lie lie what do you
[02:52:59.880 --> 02:53:03.240]  look you know what you ought to do you ought to find somebody to tell you what
[02:53:03.240 --> 02:53:08.640]  are the temperatures inside those nuclear reactors because the force that struck
[02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:12.600]  me I don't know anything about it but you would think a nuclear fire is higher
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:17.440]  is a higher temperature than a kerosene fire and these nuclear reactors have
[02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:23.040]  been melting down now for over a week and why isn't all the steel containment
[02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:27.440]  which is not very thick nothing like the steel beams of the world trade center
[02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:35.560]  towers why is it melted yes sir kerosene fire caused massive steel structures
[02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:42.600]  to collapse them in an hour you know a limited low-temperature fires not even
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:47.600]  throughout the building and yet we can have these meltdowns I don't know what
[02:53:47.600 --> 02:53:54.240]  temperatures are involved in we know a 754 degrees to about 1200 and some
[02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:59.080]  reports now that the total meltdown happened in two as high as 3000 degrees
[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:05.280]  centigrade or Fahrenheit Fahrenheit well if you've got 1200 degrees Fahrenheit
[02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:11.880]  3000 you're just so far beyond anything any case things are can produce and yet
[02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:20.400]  the steel containment around these are actually not melted yet well actually
[02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:29.280]  after two weeks at number two it finally did melt two weeks those high
[02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:35.520]  temperatures but actually sort of be technical it melt it didn't melt to when
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:39.920]  it blew up blew a hole in it and ran out I'm sorry I have the associated press
[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:45.640]  right here okay well anyhow somebody really want to look at that because no
[02:54:45.640 --> 02:54:48.440]  no you're right it never melted even with thousands of degrees I mean to be
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:52.560]  technical a hole was blown from the outside one of the explosions and it was
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:56.600]  breached and then it melted inside and ran out but no it did not go through the
[02:54:56.600 --> 02:55:03.440]  steel well somebody needs I don't know but somebody that does know should face
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:10.680]  the question why nuclear fires didn't melt steel but kerosene fires did and
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:15.120]  why nuclear fires didn't melt it after all of these days and days but it only
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:18.480]  took an hour one of the world trades in the buildings and an hour and a half and
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:27.120]  the other for a limited mother kerosene fires well well doctor we we have the
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:32.000]  firefighters on video and the video of it saying it was molten lava just pouring
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:38.600]  and bubbling I mean how does kerosene do that right it can't but but you see you
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:43.840]  might we might be able to make people if the temperature is in those nuclear
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:50.720]  act of a really it's high as you said we know what the maximum temperature is
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:55.800]  large and the kerosene fire we can just simply say isn't this amazing that much
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:01.040]  thinner steel held up for weeks under much higher temperatures in one place
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:05.680]  and it just completely collapsed in the other now I guess this will come back and
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:11.040]  say oh well Japanese make better steel than American maybe that's the answer
[02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:16.960]  actually some of that still was Japanese well yeah you can now burn a
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:20.160]  building down they're talking about changing big building codes now saying
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:23.680]  that a lighter can burn one down and the engineers are fighting them on it so
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:28.000]  they're having some trouble in closing Dr. Roberts looking at this hypocrisy
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  what do you think of the fact that the Congress wasn't even consulted no
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:38.200]  resolution no authorization of force and that only Ron Paul Dennis Kucinich and a
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:42.320]  few others it's like six members have complained all the rest say we want to be
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:47.160]  vestigial we want to be ceremonial when the UN gives an order to Lord Obama he
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:52.760]  follows it I mean this means the end of any checks and balances well it's right
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:58.120]  it's Obama's Obama took Bush one step further he didn't even ask for congressional
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:03.160]  authorization he just acted on his own so I call this the final step in the
[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:10.320]  Caesarism we now have a Caesar he can do what he wants it just it doesn't the
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:17.040]  lie is meaningless it has no effect he's not subject to law unless maybe he has
[02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:24.040]  an affair with the intern but that's the situation we're in US government
[02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:29.360]  exactly branch only the executive branch of course Congress can be penalized in
[02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:33.280]  the district but the executive branch is now above the law it doesn't have to
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:38.720]  follow the law look guys treating Bradley Manning that's illegal it's not even a
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:46.280]  protest you think the ACLU would would have all kinds of court cases the about
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:53.240]  the torture of Bradley Manning but so we you know what is it is I don't see how
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:58:01.600]  it's any different than the Gestapo or Stalin well that's my next issue I you
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:04.840]  know I think we need to take things back at the state level continue to expose
[02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:11.200]  this tyranny as our last ditch to try to stop this ahead of the 1776 option but

[02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:22.760]  option could be 1776 I don't really know if we have an option because the people
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:32.880]  are so ignorant they're so brain-wise because of patriotism and they have no

[03:00:05.640 --> 03:00:13.280]  in the heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show I have
[03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:17.040]  promised to go to George Perry Robert Jasper and others work live and overdrive
[03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:21.440]  deeper into the hour I want Dr. Roberts go here in about five minutes former
[03:00:21.440 --> 03:00:26.360]  head of policy Reagan administration at the Treasury written many books his
[03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:30.480]  latest book how the economy was lost the war of the worlds tells why America is
[03:00:30.480 --> 03:00:34.720]  disintegrating and it's available just you'd be better bookstores everywhere
[03:00:34.720 --> 03:00:39.360]  amazon.com as well he also writes public columns and just gives them out to
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:42.320]  everybody great guy used to write syndicated columns but didn't like
[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:46.920]  being censored so he just fights fights for absolutely free the true mark of a
[03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:50.760]  true patriot and we really appreciate each fighting for freedom which is which
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:54.200]  is the greatest prize the great jewel in closing we were talking during that one
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:00:57.160]  minute break Dr. Roberts and I was saying I wish there was a free country to
[03:00:57.160 --> 03:01:00.280]  move to you were saying yeah there really is no where with these globalists
[03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:04.120]  they're trying to destroy Switzerland you pointed out that's one of the better
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:07.680]  places still but they're trying to get rid of its laws and its sovereignty and
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:14.520]  then you said I don't think that they can get China elaborate on that well it
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:27.640]  has a government that has long-term capability and that is in control of a
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:38.520]  situation has planned to make China the world power and who and that realizes
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:45.400]  the United States and we'll be doing whatever it can to insulate itself from
[03:01:45.400 --> 03:01:52.320]  the fallout of the American clout so I don't think China has any interest in
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:58.000]  globalism you know China has always been Chinese isolationist they're China that's
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:05.520]  right they're Chinese and they're not globalist so I don't think any kind of
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:09.960]  scheme can get them but I could draw well listen Mao had to kill 60 something
[03:02:09.960 --> 03:02:13.680]  million of them to get them in line they are the original capitalist and what
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:17.600]  you're saying is that communism is about a centimeter thick under it is
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:22.920]  basically isolationist business people and China and and and that won't play
[03:02:22.920 --> 03:02:27.320]  too well look how China spends all their money getting 94% of rare earth
[03:02:27.320 --> 03:02:31.160]  mineral mines in the world look at other building highways speed rail
[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:36.760]  everything we have got a dilapidated 70 year old rail beds in this country
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:46.520]  yeah you can hardly go anywhere on the train here yes I think China is outside
[03:02:46.520 --> 03:02:52.000]  of their plans and I think Russia is too I don't think they can get Russia they're
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:57.680]  trying I don't think they can and they almost did but Putin put an end to that
[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:06.640]  and I just don't believe that they have the kind of power to do what this
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:11.080]  globalism thing is all about I don't think they have power but they sure on
[03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:14.560]  our country and they're sure gonna rob us on the way to destruction and attack
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:18.920]  every country they can well they seem to be doing that you know look we were
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:22.600]  talking about what the American people can do and the trouble with the people is
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:27.600]  I'm saying that brainwash because the paper tells them they're ignorant they're
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:32.400]  unaware and so they haven't any reserves I mean people don't have food stock they
[03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:38.200]  don't have any plans if they they don't have any unity you know but people don't
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:44.040]  like each other neighbors can't get along people are more they're more
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:49.520]  concerned to run down the people they need to be united with well you're right
[03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:53.240]  on average America is lazy and rotten that doesn't mean we don't have good
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:03:56.960]  people here but I've got to tell you Americans have become lazy and rotten
[03:03:56.960 --> 03:04:05.600]  and they have no awareness there's no unity and there's no wet devices in there
[03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:10.080]  and each other's growth I'm not just talking about rich and poor I'm talking
[03:04:10.080 --> 03:04:15.840]  about among the poor among the middle class you know it's not a I don't think
[03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:22.120]  I stayed in for a very long time it's never had any real unity it's every
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:27.280]  person for himself you know it's even broken up family it's like that even
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:35.780]  when the family yeah and so that doesn't give you any possibility of a 17
[03:04:35.780 --> 03:04:39.800]  second well it's a cycle of decadence though every society goes through this
[03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:43.560]  and I and in the end it is what it is we've got to spread the word and do what
[03:04:43.560 --> 03:04:46.920]  we can there isn't awakening happening but you're right a lot of folks are very
[03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:50.240]  decadent dr. Roberts thank you for spending time with us we look forward

[03:05:16.040 --> 03:05:21.240]  about a one-world communist government do you realize that they will it be in
[03:05:21.240 --> 03:05:26.280]  charge of all weaponry if the United States and every other nation turns over

[03:06:15.840 --> 03:06:20.920]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[03:06:20.920 --> 03:06:26.280]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[03:06:26.280 --> 03:06:31.200]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[03:06:31.200 --> 03:06:35.600]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[03:06:35.600 --> 03:06:39.320]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:43.280]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems

[03:08:37.640 --> 03:08:42.280]  full of some of the hardest-working smartest best people on the planet but
[03:08:42.280 --> 03:08:48.240]  yes many of us have become decadent and slovenly none of us are perfect but by
[03:08:48.240 --> 03:08:52.200]  realizing that we've been brought up with issues a little or no significance
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:57.320]  distracted with things that don't matter that our minds have been filled with
[03:08:57.320 --> 03:09:00.120]  information you know the average American doesn't know the three branches of
[03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:03.680]  government that knows all about football or all about baseball or all about acting
[03:09:03.680 --> 03:09:08.120]  cool I mean we we're gonna get hurt we're getting hurt because we become
[03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:13.840]  chumps let's get streetwise now let me tell you tyranny's a good way for folks
[03:09:13.840 --> 03:09:17.560]  to wake up that's why the globalist are racing to get it in place before you
[03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:21.000]  wake up and they know you're waking up Roberts has bummed out you know because
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:24.000]  he's been on the inside of it and he just can't believe how corrupt it's
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:28.040]  gotten and how ridiculous and I understand his pessimism at some points
[03:09:28.040 --> 03:09:31.600]  and it's always interesting to have him on but I'm on the ground I mean I'm
[03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:35.720]  well-known I go all over the country and I see people everywhere and let me tell
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:40.880]  you it's exponential what's happening I want to jam in Rombert George Perry
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:44.320]  Jasper Aaron and then that's gonna be it and we'll go back into the key
[03:09:44.320 --> 03:09:47.480]  information that we were covering and retransmission but we're live right now
[03:09:47.480 --> 03:09:52.760]  the big news is Fukushima plant number two has melted down it didn't melt out
[03:09:52.760 --> 03:09:57.560]  of the core the core got damaged and ruptured and it basically melted through
[03:09:57.560 --> 03:10:01.400]  that hole and into the concrete and through the floor then it could blow up
[03:10:01.400 --> 03:10:05.760]  any time or just keep off-gassing radiation 100,000 times safe levels
[03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:10.120]  that's Japanese government but that's not big news anymore we've moved on to the
[03:10:10.120 --> 03:10:15.800]  latest celebrity scandal we've moved on to the war and how humanitarian it is
[03:10:15.800 --> 03:10:19.040]  but it's not a war because the government said so and the ground troops
[03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:22.200]  they're getting ready they're not ground troops they're helper humanitarian
[03:10:22.200 --> 03:10:26.840]  people and they're offering you the lie they're hoping you're lazy and stupid I
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:30.040]  know our listeners aren't but we've got to reach out to the rest of the public
[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:33.800]  and wake them up out of their trance and it's getting easier and easier remember
[03:10:33.800 --> 03:10:37.680]  last hour we need to make this the number one Google search term today
[03:10:37.680 --> 03:10:41.000]  because I shot a video last night Aaron's adding all the documents right now
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:44.240]  it should be done the next few hours it's close to done but he's still got to

[03:12:39.680 --> 03:12:45.880]  I think we should also try to get on one al-Iyaki we should do some sort of
[03:12:45.880 --> 03:12:49.840]  bombing with people who know how to change the wiki leaks not wiki leaks but
[03:12:49.840 --> 03:12:55.240]  the wiki files that they have on the web for your what do you call it the
[03:12:55.240 --> 03:12:59.240]  encyclopedia Wikipedia we should put on yeah that Wikipedia we should put the
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:03.640]  put on there that he is a CIA operative run and run by that and proven by the
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:07.480]  particular things that way when people look this up and then we keep changing
[03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:12.160]  to keep keep bringing that back up if they take it off that that's right that's
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:17.080]  right hit the anwar al-Iyaki Wikipedia one of the top links on him and just in
[03:13:17.080 --> 03:13:22.040]  in in in real editors of it should be able to do it all the you know articles
[03:13:22.040 --> 03:13:25.800]  about how he's admittedly CIA just start hitting it and hitting it and hitting
[03:13:25.800 --> 03:13:31.560]  it okay another thing I think we should do is we should maybe somebody just like
[03:13:31.560 --> 03:13:37.240]  you did for your your context we should put up ways to put section or for what
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:40.160]  one of those what he called those I forgot what you call those little boards
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:43.640]  where you it looks like Cheney or the president you take pictures in front of
[03:13:43.640 --> 03:13:46.480]  it and we should get one of those and maybe you can print it out on your
[03:13:46.480 --> 03:13:50.360]  printer in pieces and then make them up and then we go in front of the Pentagon
[03:13:50.360 --> 03:13:54.400]  the White House and then he's al-Iyaki and then he has a well you can't go in
[03:13:54.400 --> 03:13:57.400]  front of the White House and protest because they won't give you a permit and
[03:13:57.400 --> 03:14:01.400]  and even if you do they'll arrest you this isn't freedom but I appreciate your
[03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:05.720]  call how dare you in America think you're allowed to protest I think this is
[03:14:05.720 --> 03:14:10.840]  America Perry in Illinois a great points George Perry go ahead yeah I was
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:14.840]  watching democracy now today and they had this woman on there named Helen
[03:14:14.840 --> 03:14:22.080]  Caldecott and she did research on the thresholds for nuclear materials not
[03:14:22.080 --> 03:14:28.240]  radiation the actual materials that are used in fissile nuclear reactions and
[03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:34.760]  these materials are deadly at one microgram oh yes microgram that's smaller
[03:14:34.760 --> 03:14:39.640]  than a grain of dust but it's no problem that they're having total Chernobyl
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:43.520]  meltdown it's blowing this way see again the background radiation isn't high but
[03:14:43.520 --> 03:14:47.160]  if you get the microgram that's coming in out of the atmosphere it goes in your
[03:14:47.160 --> 03:14:51.440]  lungs you get lung cancer two years later but see then they can deny it and
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:55.440]  and this whole Libya thing it's like a wrestling match when the bad guys ref
[03:14:55.440 --> 03:14:59.680]  messes when the bad guys coach messes with the ref and then the bad guy pins
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:03.520]  the good guy that's just what the news is like now it's like a wrestling match
[03:15:03.520 --> 03:15:08.920]  where the the referee and distracted it's ridiculous very good points Perry
[03:15:08.920 --> 03:15:16.440]  thank you moving quick to get everybody robert michigan you're on the air yes
[03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:24.520]  yes Alex yes are you doing good first-time caller I've been listening to
[03:15:24.520 --> 03:15:29.120]  you quite a bit though I'm all excited trying to organize myself fear
[03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:34.840]  recognize my thoughts I ran across a couple things on the media the other
[03:15:34.840 --> 03:15:40.480]  day that kind of stuck in my crawl I thought maybe you'd be interested
[03:15:40.480 --> 03:15:48.680]  sure tell us a talk show host radio talk show host I just happened to run
[03:15:48.680 --> 03:15:52.960]  across them he's apparently trying to start a new
[03:15:52.960 --> 03:16:00.480]  bad people are when people call in they ask him how he's doing and his bad
[03:16:00.480 --> 03:16:07.880]  answer is better than I deserve and then I noticed that he was turning around and
[03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:13.200]  he was asking people that called in how they were doing and they say better than
[03:16:13.200 --> 03:16:19.400]  I deserve and I'm thinking now what is this better than I deserve thing I mean
[03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:27.960]  our has this guy trying to get American radio listeners to just
[03:16:27.960 --> 03:16:33.640]  automatically resign themselves to the fact that they don't deserve what they
[03:16:33.640 --> 03:16:37.960]  listen Robert I appreciate your call you're on to something all over Whole
[03:16:37.960 --> 03:16:41.880]  Foods they have magazines about austerity and how great it is to be poor and how
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:46.080]  it's good to be robbed and be a chump and you're hit on something here people
[03:16:46.080 --> 03:16:49.640]  don't like to admit they're under attack so they're making it stylish to be under
[03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:54.440]  attack so they can feel powerful in being losers it's very sick I call it the
[03:16:54.440 --> 03:16:59.840]  giggling gibbering slave mentality Jasper in Oklahoma you're on the air hey

[03:17:15.360 --> 03:17:21.720]  amendment I can't afford non GMO fees or gold what what do people like me doing
[03:17:21.720 --> 03:17:27.280]  a situation you buy a lawn mower and knock on a hundred doors and 20 people
[03:17:27.280 --> 03:17:31.160]  will tell you you can mow their yard and then you'll have giant wads of cash in

[03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:46.960]  ahead and talk to Aaron in Nevada Aaron you're on the air Aaron go knock on
[03:17:46.960 --> 03:17:52.120]  go knock radio check it out here on Fukushima I've been covering this the
[03:17:52.120 --> 03:17:56.120]  past three weeks when I tell people what's going on they are actually
[03:17:56.120 --> 03:18:00.920]  considering decommissioning the Fukushima reactors which he lose to the
[03:18:00.920 --> 03:18:05.240]  fact that they have been trying to salvage them all along no no that's
[03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:08.720]  admitted that that's why they didn't know they've been trying to save them the
[03:18:08.720 --> 03:18:14.440]  whole time exactly and the president of the company was just admitted into the
[03:18:14.440 --> 03:18:20.240]  hospital last night the whole thing is this issue of the corporates just like
[03:18:20.240 --> 03:18:25.560]  BP want to go forward and get through this at the other end they're citing
[03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:29.960]  the president is citing they want to provide power for the people of the
[03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:35.560]  Fukushima prefecture and they're also discussing liability and legal
[03:18:35.560 --> 03:18:40.520]  ramifications so this is their whole focus it's a no no no for for for what
[03:18:40.520 --> 03:18:46.640]  18 19 days whatever it is now they've been covering their hind in and they're
[03:18:46.640 --> 03:18:49.920]  also covering up what's happening at the hospitals the radiation sickness I
[03:18:49.920 --> 03:18:54.080]  wonder why they have the plant suddenly in the hospital he should be healthy if
[03:18:54.080 --> 03:18:56.360]  he was around radiation according to Ann Coulter
[03:18:56.360 --> 03:19:02.240]  well this is what I'm saying here's the key they he has recently said he wants
[03:19:02.240 --> 03:19:07.040]  to cover parts parts of the plant in a Chernobyl concrete encapsulation like
[03:19:07.040 --> 03:19:10.720]  I've come on here and said on the show previously but they want to keep a
[03:19:10.720 --> 03:19:14.240]  portion of it going well it's not just that though if you have ruptured
[03:19:14.240 --> 03:19:18.440]  containment facilities from the explosion even if you put a sarcophagus
[03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:21.480]  around it it'll burn and melt through that and it's now done that at number
[03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:25.760]  two we're out of time thank you Aaron Gator Sue will have to get to you guys
[03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:30.360]  tomorrow key information dealing with the fake al-qaeda threat coming up from
[03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:33.960]  the retransmission from the first hour but there's the headline Japan nuclear
[03:19:33.960 --> 03:19:37.880]  power plant boss in the hospital the president of the company that owns
[03:19:37.880 --> 03:19:40.620]  Japan strict and Fukushima nuclear power station has been taken to the
[03:19:40.620 --> 03:19:45.800]  hospital and he's suffering from diseases and high blood pressure yeah I
[03:19:45.800 --> 03:19:49.800]  bet kind of like the president of Egypt disappeared with a stroke wonder if he's
[03:19:49.800 --> 03:19:54.000]  got radiation sickness he's been around the Fukushima facility but he should be
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:57.640]  great according to Ann Coulter search al-qaeda Pentagon run do it right now
[03:19:57.640 --> 03:20:04.640]  let's make it number one
