[00:00.000 --> 00:17.000]  to say this is going to be one hell of a transmission is putting it lightly. We have breaking news
[00:17.000 --> 00:23.880]  coming up on the worsening situation with illegal alien invaders from the Congo, infested
[00:23.880 --> 00:30.520]  nation with Ebola, pouring in not by the hundreds, but the thousands to Texas. Global
[00:30.520 --> 00:35.320]  explosives coming up here today. First, here's John Bowne's report on the danger.
[00:35.320 --> 00:41.360]  The number of Ebola cases surpasses 2,000 in the Congo where it originates from. Those
[00:41.360 --> 00:46.560]  fighting the horrific viral hemorrhagic fever are under attack as Reuters reported. The
[00:46.560 --> 00:52.240]  Deputy Mayor of Benai in the Eastern Democratic of Congo said 13 civilians were killed in
[00:52.240 --> 00:57.440]  an attack by the Allied Democratic Forces, the ADF, a group thought to be linked to the
[00:57.440 --> 01:04.400]  Islamic State. Back in 2014, the Sierra Leone outbreak resulted in over 28,000 infections
[01:04.400 --> 01:10.600]  and roughly 11,000 dead. It's no wonder that we are seeing immigrants from the Congo crossing
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.000]  the U.S.'s southwestern border. Recently, U.S. Border Patrol reported they had apprehended
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.120]  15 immigrants from Congo. We build the wall crowdsourcing founder Brian Colfage posted
[01:22.120 --> 01:30.120]  on his Facebook page claiming an as-yet-unconfirmed DHS insider exposed to him, U.S. Congo migrants
[01:30.120 --> 01:36.360]  have made it to the USA with confirmed cases of Ebola. Three are in custody in Laredo, Texas
[01:36.360 --> 01:42.480]  and six in Laredo, Mexico and in Juarez right next to their wall. But even if Colfage's
[01:42.480 --> 01:48.640]  information is flawed, what's to stop Ebola from spreading amongst refugees south of the
[01:48.640 --> 01:54.240]  border? And then what? Over a million immigrants will cross the border in 2019 alone and they
[01:54.240 --> 01:59.960]  are being flown and bussed all over the United States on the taxpayer's dime. Ebola can take
[01:59.960 --> 02:06.000]  up to 21 days to manifest. That gives an infected immigrant roughly three weeks to illegally
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.080]  enter the country and spread Ebola via body fluids. Fortunately, hospital staff in the
[02:11.080 --> 02:16.200]  United States have been trained due to the international panic from a 2014 Sierra Leone
[02:16.200 --> 02:20.960]  outbreak. At present, the risk to our nation directly is extremely low just because of
[02:20.960 --> 02:27.920]  where this is. That may change if we get outbreaks, if it spreads into Goma or into Kinshasa
[02:27.920 --> 02:34.000]  or into, you know, into Kampala or something like that as we get, if this sort of dwells
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.560]  on. But we do have a very effective screening program now that we've developed in a sense
[02:39.560 --> 02:44.520]  as a consequence of that 2014 experience. So I do think we're very prepared here. This
[02:44.520 --> 02:48.920]  is why I come back and say, and I'll say to you and in general for our health security,
[02:48.920 --> 02:54.920]  the best thing this nation can do to protect its health security is to detect, respond
[02:54.920 --> 03:00.160]  and prevent these outbreaks where they start. But why would we disregard national security
[03:00.160 --> 03:06.440]  to a degree that puts us all at risk? Is it simply to satisfy the Democrats' fantasy
[03:06.440 --> 03:12.760]  that there is no crisis on the border? Last month alone, we saw 144,000 people come
[03:12.760 --> 03:19.720]  into our country illegally. It is overwhelming our system. President Trump made it clear
[03:19.720 --> 03:25.120]  that Mexico must do more. Yesterday, the president directed us, myself, the Secretary
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.920]  of State and our team to meet with the Mexican delegation at their request and hear them
[03:30.920 --> 03:39.080]  out. Progress was made. The Mexican delegation brought forward proposals, but as the president
[03:39.080 --> 03:42.800]  said last night, it was not nearly enough. And we made it clear yesterday at the White
[03:42.800 --> 03:47.920]  House that Mexico must do significantly more. I think it's safe to say you've talked to
[03:47.920 --> 03:54.000]  all of our members. We're not fans of terrorists. We're still hoping that this can be avoided.
[03:54.000 --> 04:02.440]  At the same time, it's way past time that President's request for assistance from our
[04:02.440 --> 04:07.640]  government be met. I mean, we walked out of here after we did the supplemental, and the
[04:07.640 --> 04:14.280]  Democrats insisted on taking out of the supplemental they just passed in the House yesterday anything
[04:14.280 --> 04:21.320]  to address the humanitarian crisis at the border that would be funded by Health and
[04:21.320 --> 04:26.720]  Human Services. We all believe that immigration is the constant reinvigration of America
[04:26.720 --> 04:32.120]  enriching America with immigrants enriching America with their hopes, their dreams, their
[04:32.120 --> 04:39.840]  aspirations. And again, it's a happy, really a happy day because our dreamers, they're
[04:39.840 --> 04:44.280]  the gold standard. They love America. They're patriotic. How can the government claim they
[04:44.280 --> 04:49.440]  have an interest in national security and continue a position of open borders where
[04:49.440 --> 04:56.440]  millions of U.S. citizens could die from diseases crossing that border? John Bown reporting.

[05:38.000 --> 05:43.840]  big overhaul. Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself. I've got

[06:05.080 --> 06:14.160]  You are listening to an infowarstore.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[06:14.160 --> 06:28.680]  you are the resistance. From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting
[06:28.680 --> 06:39.400]  worldwide, it's Alex Jones. As even mainstream media has admitted in hundreds of publications,
[06:39.400 --> 06:44.480]  we have a pretty close relationship with ICE, with Board Patrol, and with the governor's
[06:44.480 --> 06:51.800]  office. And info wars was the first to break seven years ago that Obama was shipping in
[06:51.800 --> 06:56.400]  men, women and children and loading them on buses. They weren't being screened. They were
[06:56.400 --> 07:04.160]  being sent all over the United States. Well, Texas News, ABC CBS, they've been reporting
[07:04.160 --> 07:10.200]  down in San Antonio, but it's been a national news blackout other than drudgerport.com linking
[07:10.200 --> 07:23.480]  to it. And that is over 300 illegal aliens shipped in by smugglers brought in to Texas.
[07:23.480 --> 07:29.000]  Well, we have sources high level. Many times, they're on camera. This time, they're not
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.640]  on camera, but they are probably going to be on Fox News the next few days. They're
[07:33.640 --> 07:39.800]  actually wondering why Fox News hasn't covered this when it broke last Friday. They've wondered
[07:39.800 --> 07:47.640]  why it's on drudge, and it's not a national story, that Ebola-infested Congo, that's at
[07:47.640 --> 07:53.120]  the second biggest outbreak in its history, some say the biggest, thousands dead, dead
[07:53.120 --> 08:00.080]  bodies all over the place are fleeing and that these are middle class and wealthy Congonies
[08:00.080 --> 08:04.800]  that are actually coming in. That's why a lot of them are dressed very nice. They had
[08:04.800 --> 08:09.760]  money to get here, and they came into Guatemala, came up through Mexico and crossed the Rio
[08:09.760 --> 08:14.800]  Grande. And whereas you would think of them as poor in the United States for people from
[08:14.800 --> 08:23.320]  the Congo, they actually had money to pay smugglers, they're here fleeing Ebola. And
[08:23.320 --> 08:29.040]  I'm not ready to report all this yet because we've got footage, we've got contacts, I've
[08:29.040 --> 08:34.880]  got to then run it past our contacts once we've got it together, the transcript to make
[08:34.880 --> 08:42.840]  sure we don't reveal anything. But the border patrol legitimately believes that Ebola will
[08:42.840 --> 08:51.280]  end up crossing into the U.S. And here's the even bigger news. Ebola has crossed before,
[08:51.280 --> 08:55.720]  remember five years ago, and it got covered up, but was later admitted that Ebola was
[08:55.720 --> 09:03.680]  in Michigan, was in New York, was in Virginia, and was in Texas. That was all confirmed.
[09:03.680 --> 09:09.320]  And so other than ZeroHedge.com or DrudgeReport.com or local news in Texas or InfoWars.com, you're
[09:09.320 --> 09:15.680]  not getting this reportage. You've got a DrudgeReport.com, hundreds of illegals from Ebola-ridden
[09:15.680 --> 09:24.960]  Congo dumped in Texas, 350 more on the way. Well, I talked this morning to our ICE sources
[09:24.960 --> 09:30.800]  in Texas, and I talked to the governor's office. And off record, they confirmed, they
[09:30.800 --> 09:38.280]  said, yes, this is total crisis. We cannot believe that Mexico is even allowing this.
[09:38.280 --> 09:44.560]  And that the word is, upwards of a thousand more have crossed in the last few days at
[09:44.560 --> 09:53.480]  different points. You say, well, why is the border patrol stopping them? That's like saying,
[09:53.480 --> 10:00.120]  you know, why can't you go out and grab every fire ant that's in your yard? We're overwhelmed.
[10:00.120 --> 10:06.840]  The border has collapsed. The judges are overwhelmed. The courts are overwhelmed. Nine out of ten
[10:06.840 --> 10:13.320]  more show up again to court. I imagine you're one border patrol agent, and 300 people come
[10:13.320 --> 10:17.800]  walking past you, and they say, we're here to turn ourselves in under law when they make
[10:17.800 --> 10:23.440]  it past that one foot deep river at the point they crossed. You can roll the video for TV
[10:23.440 --> 10:27.520]  viewers. Just one group of 300 and something coming across a week and a half ago, and they're
[10:27.520 --> 10:34.400]  in San Antonio right now. And more showed up last night. Now, I'm going to leave it
[10:34.400 --> 10:39.200]  at that, but we've got footage of all this. We've got new footage. Nobody else has gotten
[10:39.200 --> 10:43.760]  just like when we got footage of the big bags of cocaine being brought across the Trump
[10:43.760 --> 10:50.240]  plate. We've got footage that powerful. But because we're banned from all the streaming
[10:50.240 --> 10:53.720]  services, you haven't seen it yet. And so it's got to be uploaded. It's got to be sent
[10:53.720 --> 10:59.440]  in from the crews in the field, and it's got to be aired here. That's the war we're in.
[10:59.440 --> 11:02.920]  That's why the globalists don't want us to have that big access to Facebook or big access
[11:02.920 --> 11:07.920]  to YouTube because they don't want you to see people saying they could speak English.
[11:07.920 --> 11:13.720]  A few words were like, have you, because we have the French translation. Were you fleeing
[11:13.720 --> 11:20.040]  Ebola? The secondary language is French. They say, yes, Ebola. We fleeing Ebola. Do you know
[11:20.040 --> 11:31.320]  people that Ebola? Yes. Yes, we flee Ebola. So we're going to have that for you. And that's
[11:31.320 --> 11:35.320]  why they don't want us on air. But guess what? We're on over 200 radio stations, over 100
[11:35.320 --> 11:38.880]  cable and TV stations. A lot of mom and pops, they're all precious. They've got their own
[11:38.880 --> 11:42.680]  internet systems. And all the listeners should find out where we're on locally and promote
[11:42.680 --> 11:47.200]  their local stream, their local web page, because they're not going to stop the signal.
[11:47.200 --> 11:51.920]  They're not going to stop us reporting on this. And you can always get the email as
[11:51.920 --> 11:56.400]  well, but not if it's Gmail or others. They will block our email now. That's right. They're
[11:56.400 --> 12:02.240]  so criminal, so evil, so controlling. They do that at the URL level, stopping an infowars.com
[12:02.240 --> 12:06.200]  article. But we can still send over news wars and prison planet and summit.news. That's
[12:06.200 --> 12:12.640]  Paul's site. So those are easier to send out, summit.news, newswars.com. You need to send
[12:12.640 --> 12:17.240]  those out, folks, because it's the only way this gets out other than Drudge Report. So
[12:17.240 --> 12:24.080]  again, ladies and gentlemen, this is very, very important information. You're getting
[12:24.080 --> 12:30.880]  global exclusive here. And I'm not ready to report all the details yet, but more have
[12:30.880 --> 12:39.680]  crossed hailing from the Congo. The word is upwards of a thousand. There are others pouring
[12:39.680 --> 12:46.520]  in by the thousands from other African nations, including North African individuals admitting
[12:46.520 --> 12:50.840]  that they're with ISIS. That's already been in the news last week. This is insane. This
[12:50.840 --> 12:55.440]  is biblical. You thought the hordes flooding into Europe, those big giant streams you saw,
[12:55.440 --> 13:01.080]  we should probably roll that for TV viewers. You thought that was bad. This is just distributed
[13:01.080 --> 13:07.240]  in smaller pockets, but a thousand here, 300 here, a thousand there, 5,000 here, 50 here.
[13:07.240 --> 13:15.840]  This is tens of thousands upon tens of thousands a week, absolutely pouring in, coming in in
[13:15.840 --> 13:26.800]  mass. And it's incredible moment for this country and for the world. And we have to
[13:26.800 --> 13:32.640]  get prepared. We have to understand how serious it is. We have to learn to deal with it. And
[13:32.640 --> 13:37.080]  we have to understand why it's happening. The globalists are collapsing our borders.
[13:37.080 --> 13:43.000]  They're collapsing Europe's borders. They are invading with the most poor, most diseased,
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.120]  malnourished people on average with criminal records, you name it, to absolutely collapse
[13:48.120 --> 13:53.840]  the system. Remember, the UN called for 600 million migrants to invade the U.S., globalist
[13:53.840 --> 14:03.800]  plot to collapse, America explained. So it's all coming up today. Then cover of the New
[14:03.800 --> 14:08.320]  York Times yesterday calling for Paul Joseph Watson to be destroyed, taken off the Internet
[14:08.320 --> 14:14.280]  everywhere, total disinformation piece. I guess yours truly as well, signaling the next
[14:14.280 --> 14:19.360]  phase of the purge. Trump must take action. He says he will. He's warned Twitter and others
[14:19.360 --> 14:24.000]  that he is going to take action. Well, he now said he will take action. So I believe
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.040]  it now. He so far said, well, he's looking at it. He's studying it. But now there's a
[14:28.040 --> 14:34.720]  race to the finish lines with the censorship and all of it. We're also going to have two
[14:34.720 --> 14:39.160]  of my lawyers on with the pep in the frog case. I can give you the exclusive on that.
[14:39.160 --> 14:45.520]  That has settled as of right now, as of just minutes ago. InfoWars.com will have the global
[14:45.520 --> 14:49.520]  exclusive the next 10 minutes. Paul Watson's writing an article about it. Love statement
[14:49.520 --> 14:53.680]  by Robert Barnes and he'll be popping in the Mark Rondaza as well at the bottom of the
[14:53.680 --> 15:00.680]  hour. Big victory on that front. Word is they spent a million, 300,000 against us. We spent
[15:00.680 --> 15:06.120]  100,000 fighting them. They came or deposed me. We deposed fury, all of it. They were
[15:06.120 --> 15:11.240]  asking for 2.4 million. The judge ruled against them two weeks ago and said, you'll get 14,000.
[15:11.240 --> 15:18.960]  Even if the jury says you win trial set for July 16th. They tried to settle for, I'm
[15:18.960 --> 15:22.960]  not going to say the number. It's so small, but I wouldn't be able to speak about it.
[15:22.960 --> 15:27.600]  But now they came back as I know we're going to go to the jury trial. And I said, Mr. Fury
[15:27.600 --> 15:31.480]  said everybody could use the frog. It was free to air. You're going to lose. They just
[15:31.480 --> 15:35.600]  came back with a $15,000 settlement. I can say whatever I want about what happened and
[15:35.600 --> 15:41.840]  I'm going to tell you Clinton's law firm, the biggest law firm in the country. They
[15:41.840 --> 15:48.840]  wanted 2.4 million. You get 15,000. You spent 1,200,000 doing it. You lost. We win. We'll
[15:48.840 --> 15:55.040]  fight every damn one of your events in America will defeat you. You will be defeated global

[17:04.320 --> 17:09.400]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[17:09.400 --> 17:16.280]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the US,
[17:16.280 --> 17:21.840]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began

[19:29.360 --> 19:44.800]  Tomorrow's news, today. Info Wars.com. I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com. We knew
[19:44.800 --> 19:49.000]  this censorship is coming forever. We have our own video streams, our own audio streams

[19:56.520 --> 20:03.600]  things go websites. Please go there.
[20:03.600 --> 20:28.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:28.280 --> 20:34.520]  Downtown San Antonio's bus station just got a little busier as hundreds of migrants from
[20:34.520 --> 20:40.800]  the Congo and Angola arrive in the Alamo City. We didn't get a heads up. Dr. Colleen Bridger,
[20:40.800 --> 20:45.960]  the interim assistant city manager says the Congolese migrants started coming in on Tuesday
[20:45.960 --> 20:51.440]  and said they traveled with a group of about 350 migrants through Ecuador to the southern
[20:51.440 --> 20:57.880]  border. When we called border patrol, they said, yeah, probably another two to 300 from
[20:57.880 --> 21:02.880]  the Congo and from Angola will be coming to San Antonio.
[21:02.880 --> 21:07.320]  That includes Masenji, a Congolese migrant who didn't want his face on camera but told
[21:07.320 --> 21:12.400]  me via Google translate he came to America for security reasons and said, quote, my family
[21:12.400 --> 21:38.400]  is one of them.
[21:38.400 --> 21:51.080]  We're going to air that full reports for you, just in a few minutes here, but wanted to
[21:51.080 --> 21:55.920]  give you a taste of it, about a bunch of other reports we're going to be getting to.
[21:55.920 --> 22:02.120]  MS-13 admits they're now using kidnapped children as human shields to get into the U.S., and
[22:02.120 --> 22:06.440]  they're loading up on from Nicaragua, El Salvador, and other countries.
[22:06.440 --> 22:11.080]  As they get to Texas, mainly in California, they load up on government-funded buses and
[22:11.080 --> 22:15.320]  Democrat-controlled vehicles, and they are shipped to different parts of the country.
[22:15.320 --> 22:19.520]  In many cases, the children are thrown out on the street.
[22:19.520 --> 22:26.320]  In other cases, and I have these news reports right here, in other cases, they just simply
[22:26.320 --> 22:27.760]  sell them into sex slavery.
[22:27.760 --> 22:30.240]  And again, this is mainstream news.
[22:30.240 --> 22:31.240]  I have the articles right here.
[22:31.240 --> 22:34.800]  We covered it yesterday on The Sunday Show, and it's just like liberal and loving.
[22:34.800 --> 22:38.040]  The left says this is a good thing.
[22:38.040 --> 22:45.880]  You remember back with the whole Ebola situation, five years ago when it was breaking out in
[22:45.880 --> 22:51.280]  the Congo so bad, you remember all that?
[22:51.280 --> 22:56.640]  Well, if you just had doctors that had been around Ebola patients, they had to be on quarantine
[22:56.640 --> 23:02.240]  for a month at the CDC headquarters, where they had whole wings set up, you can pull
[23:02.240 --> 23:03.240]  that up.
[23:03.240 --> 23:10.800]  But now we got people that say they're fleeing Ebola that had money to fly into Guatemala
[23:10.800 --> 23:20.040]  and then march up to the Texas border once they got dumped off by buses and brought
[23:20.040 --> 23:25.280]  in to the good old United States of America.
[23:25.280 --> 23:31.760]  So just think about that.
[23:31.760 --> 23:37.760]  That's the point that we've gotten to as a culture and as a society.
[23:37.760 --> 23:40.520]  That's the point we've gotten to.
[23:40.520 --> 23:44.880]  That you've got all these infectious diseases pouring in.
[23:44.880 --> 23:59.880]  You've got MS-13 that is using human shields of children and using children that have diseases.
[23:59.880 --> 24:02.440]  So let me look at my clip list here.
[24:02.440 --> 24:06.160]  Meanie, Manny, Moe, catch a tiger by its toe.
[24:06.160 --> 24:11.560]  Should I play that clip that we just played part of where they've got the folks here from
[24:11.560 --> 24:16.640]  the Congo and thousands more coming and over a thousand have gotten in according to border
[24:16.640 --> 24:17.640]  patrol?
[24:17.640 --> 24:22.840]  Or should we play even CNN calls out Bernie Sanders when he falsely calls border crisis
[24:22.840 --> 24:23.840]  fake?
[24:23.840 --> 24:26.920]  Yeah, that's a talking point from two months ago.
[24:26.920 --> 24:31.320]  That was used in 2018 and then for the first four or five months this year.
[24:31.320 --> 24:36.200]  Now that hoodwinking didn't work on the public saying there is no migrant caravans.
[24:36.200 --> 24:37.360]  There is no crisis.
[24:37.360 --> 24:43.040]  So now Bernie, though, looks pretty senile out on the campaign trail.
[24:43.040 --> 24:49.200]  Looks like he's got some old talking points there.
[24:49.200 --> 24:51.440]  How about we play this one as I mentioned it?
[24:51.440 --> 25:01.920]  Main gang members use child as a human shield with chicken pox to try to enter the United
[25:01.920 --> 25:08.080]  States saying you've got to render aid, we've got sick children.
[25:08.080 --> 25:15.920]  And then when the border patrol gets completely overwhelmed by 150,000 people, I'm sorry,
[25:15.920 --> 25:22.880]  26,000 people that they're catching every month and that's who they're catching.
[25:22.880 --> 25:30.640]  150 plus thousand people, they estimate there's twice as many that get in that don't get caught.
[25:30.640 --> 25:32.840]  And then people are like, well, Trump needs to hold them.
[25:32.840 --> 25:34.320]  Trump didn't get the money from Congress.
[25:34.320 --> 25:38.800]  Remember he wanted $12 billion, he got $1.3 billion, remember?
[25:38.800 --> 25:39.800]  Things cost money.
[25:39.800 --> 25:45.000]  Oh, and I saw the Mexican envoy on Fox this morning, we're trying to find it, it was about
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.880]  like 8.30 in the morning, and they were playing a clip of him in Spanish saying, we have told
[25:49.880 --> 25:53.160]  Trump we have too many, we can't take them.
[25:53.160 --> 26:00.000]  They can't stay here, exactly 150 something thousand a month they're getting caught.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.520]  You know it's way more than that, they're coming through your country.
[26:02.520 --> 26:05.720]  Most of them aren't even Mexicans, they're from all over the world, and then you're freaking
[26:05.720 --> 26:09.440]  out and you just think magically we can handle it.
[26:09.440 --> 26:16.680]  Who drives through the United States, and other than some of the wealthier cities?
[26:16.680 --> 26:21.360]  The rural areas are poorer than they've ever been, you know, Americans are poorer than
[26:21.360 --> 26:22.360]  they've ever been.
[26:22.360 --> 26:27.640]  Trump's trying to turn that around, people don't have money, I mean what does Mexico
[26:27.640 --> 26:28.640]  think?
[26:28.640 --> 26:32.240]  Mexico's on the high end of third world, the truth is the U.S. is becoming a third world
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.960]  country, and Trump's being demonized, Trump's being attacked, we're trying to stop it, but
[26:36.960 --> 26:41.240]  see the global snow, once they've run us into a third world country, will be dysfunctional
[26:41.240 --> 26:42.240]  forever.
[26:42.240 --> 26:48.600]  I went to a dental office yesterday that's closed on Sundays, but that my dad owns a
[26:48.600 --> 26:59.640]  piece of, he's a dentist, and he was going to fix a cracked tooth, and I get there, this
[26:59.640 --> 27:09.120]  is the place I've been going to for 10 years in South Austin, and it looked like Guatemala,
[27:09.120 --> 27:14.960]  these were not Mexicans, these were people in traditional Indian, Guatemalan, and I saw
[27:14.960 --> 27:22.880]  Peruvians, and again, nothing against these poor people, but I mean, you know what a Guatemalan
[27:22.880 --> 27:28.240]  looks like, you know what a Peruvian looks like, and I was like holy Toledo, because
[27:28.240 --> 27:31.800]  I've been in some of these countries, I mean, you know, I've watched PBS, I know, there
[27:31.800 --> 27:36.560]  were women running around in Indian dresses all over the place, and parties in the parking
[27:36.560 --> 27:41.600]  lot, and just total insane asylum, I was looking at the license plates, these people didn't
[27:41.600 --> 27:47.760]  even have license plates, a bunch of them, they just do whatever the hell they want,
[27:47.760 --> 27:53.280]  and all I know is, I'm just supposed to not even care, I'm supposed to pay all the taxes
[27:53.280 --> 27:56.360]  and all the insurance and do everything I'm supposed to do, and boy, if I do something
[27:56.360 --> 28:00.320]  without a line, the cops come after me, but meanwhile I go over to a place that was a
[28:00.320 --> 28:07.400]  nice area in South Austin, it wasn't a rich area, but it was a nice area, and everything
[28:07.400 --> 28:12.960]  over the last few years looks like hell, the sidewalks are all filthy and dirty, and there's
[28:12.960 --> 28:22.120]  a dirty diaper over here, and trash cans overflowing, and just the collapse of civilization, and
[28:22.120 --> 28:26.520]  we're not helping them from the third world, we're becoming the third world folks, and
[28:26.520 --> 28:32.960]  let me tell you, Mexico's got problems, you go to Peru, or you go to places like Guatemala,
[28:32.960 --> 28:40.800]  baby, you're thinking you're lucky stars, you're in Mexico, so Mexico is collapsing,
[28:40.800 --> 28:45.920]  we're collapsing, I didn't get to the clips, they're all coming up, this is just so crazy,
[28:45.920 --> 28:51.280]  ladies and gentlemen, it's completely and totally out of control, and something's gotta
[28:51.280 --> 28:59.880]  be done now, but the globalist on the left says, there is no problem, go back to sleep.
[28:59.880 --> 29:04.400]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.640]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood
[29:09.640 --> 29:14.360]  sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of
[29:14.360 --> 29:18.840]  these that can alert you that something is wrong, here how heart and body extract is
[29:18.840 --> 29:22.840]  making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[32:01.080 --> 32:08.440]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history.
[32:08.440 --> 32:22.080]  This is a digital, AI enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or infowars.com.
[32:22.080 --> 32:23.800]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[32:23.800 --> 32:25.000]  This is racketeering.
[32:25.000 --> 32:26.000]  This is cartels.
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.520]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[32:28.520 --> 32:30.400]  We need it now.
[32:30.400 --> 32:32.040]  You can take on big tech.
[32:32.040 --> 32:39.400]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[32:39.400 --> 32:41.000]  populist organization.
[32:41.000 --> 32:45.720]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[32:45.720 --> 32:48.720]  off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[32:48.720 --> 32:53.880]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever and make it a standard
[32:53.880 --> 32:55.720]  of freedom and free speech.
[32:55.720 --> 33:03.080]  Again, they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[33:03.080 --> 33:22.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.120 --> 33:26.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:26.960 --> 33:28.680]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:28.680 --> 33:35.000]  Well so does he, live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:35.000 --> 33:46.280]  If you're a TV viewer, you see the incredible headline, DrudgeReport.com, Ebola, ladies and
[33:46.280 --> 33:52.080]  gentlemen, Ebola, the second biggest outbreak in history taking place in the Congo.
[33:52.080 --> 34:00.000]  Border battle, hundreds from Ebola-ridden Congo dumped in Texas, the video.
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.160]  Kids with chickenpox being brought across by MS-13 saying it's human shields.
[34:05.160 --> 34:09.160]  The government admitting that up to 30% of the children aren't with their parents and
[34:09.160 --> 34:13.360]  have been kidnapped by known gang members and the Democrats say, don't stop it, just
[34:13.360 --> 34:15.400]  let them in and let them disappear.
[34:15.400 --> 34:20.240]  The Senate report admits masses of them have been kidnapped.
[34:20.240 --> 34:28.080]  And watch that space at DrudgeReport.com because we've got reporters at the border and in San
[34:28.080 --> 34:29.080]  Antonio.
[34:29.080 --> 34:33.840]  I don't want to say it because the NGOs will obviously call and warn the people, it doesn't
[34:33.840 --> 34:34.840]  matter.
[34:34.840 --> 34:37.800]  We already have been on the phone with Border Patrol this morning.
[34:37.800 --> 34:42.200]  I have already had our crew in the field and I can tell you the Border Patrol and the
[34:42.200 --> 34:46.960]  governor's office, people we talked to, are like, yeah, we've sent all this to Fox last
[34:46.960 --> 34:49.160]  week, it's not on there.
[34:49.160 --> 34:58.080]  We saw it on Drudge so what I was told seven years ago and we met on camera with the head
[34:58.080 --> 35:01.760]  of the Border Patrol Union for that sector and we had the head of the Border Patrol
[35:01.760 --> 35:02.760]  for that area.
[35:02.760 --> 35:04.960]  They were risking their jobs against Obama.
[35:04.960 --> 35:08.760]  One of them actually did get removed later because they just cared about all the disease
[35:08.760 --> 35:12.200]  coming in and their duty and they just said, listen, these aren't kids, these are human
[35:12.200 --> 35:13.200]  shields.
[35:13.200 --> 35:18.440]  We broke the first buses and how Obama was bringing in these whole groups, calling them
[35:18.440 --> 35:20.280]  families when they weren't.
[35:20.280 --> 35:22.760]  But the Border Patrol didn't come to us first.
[35:22.760 --> 35:25.420]  They went to Fox News first.
[35:25.420 --> 35:33.560]  They went to ABC News, well, they went to Fox News again last week and Fox News is yet to
[35:33.560 --> 35:34.560]  cover it.
[35:34.560 --> 35:37.640]  They've covered the Africans coming in but not the Ebola, not that it's hundreds but
[35:37.640 --> 35:42.520]  it's thousands and that the Border Patrol believes that some of them may have Ebola because
[35:42.520 --> 35:48.480]  they know people that had Ebola, they were fleeing Ebola-ridden areas and that Ebola
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.840]  can chestache or incubate for up to a month.
[35:52.840 --> 35:57.840]  Remember when doctors used to come back from the Congo, the last time it was a big outbreak
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.120]  five years ago, they had to be in quarantine for a month.
[36:02.120 --> 36:06.720]  So I'm just glad we're here because, see, Fox News won't run a lot of this.
[36:06.720 --> 36:12.240]  We're here, we break it, we cover local news, Drudge links to it, he forces it out and the
[36:12.240 --> 36:17.840]  reason I got the call from the Border Patrol sources was, hey, Alex, we appreciate you,
[36:17.840 --> 36:24.000]  you know, obviously we tried to give it to Fox first but the words were they must be
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.160]  sitting on Hannity and Carlson and I haven't called Tucker Carlson yet to see if they're
[36:29.160 --> 36:34.600]  making him sit on this and I don't want to go into our back channel talks but I'm a
[36:34.600 --> 36:38.480]  little busy so I haven't had time to check into this yet.
[36:38.480 --> 36:44.320]  But imagine in America you've got not hundreds but thousands from the Congo fleeing and these
[36:44.320 --> 36:49.360]  are more middle class and wealthy Congonese that are able to get to the United States
[36:49.360 --> 36:54.880]  via Guatemala up through Mexico with their kids, they're scared and they've talked to
[36:54.880 --> 36:59.560]  ICE who was ordered to release them because they don't have any beds for them and they
[36:59.560 --> 37:05.240]  told them, no, we're fleeing Ebola and so you're going to see video of all of this today and
[37:05.240 --> 37:10.600]  tomorrow we've got our every criminal we've got they can go is in the field in at the
[37:10.600 --> 37:14.400]  border and in South Texas and in San Antonio right now.
[37:14.400 --> 37:19.080]  Everybody we've got we've got six people and I wish I had a hundred folks but that's
[37:19.080 --> 37:23.000]  why infowars is so important because we'll hit the barbed wire.
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.720]  We'll cover the story the system doesn't want you to know about now speaking of that joining
[37:27.720 --> 37:32.680]  us is Mark Rendazza constitutional lawyer under the preeminent First Amendment lawyers
[37:32.680 --> 37:36.640]  out there along with Robert Barnes is also a preeminent civil rights lawyer and First
[37:36.640 --> 37:40.040]  Amendment lawyer as well you see them all over the news Constable we'll go to Barnes
[37:40.040 --> 37:45.600]  first here it just went live on info wars dot com Paul Joseph Watson put the blurb out
[37:45.600 --> 37:52.040]  info war settles pepper the frog lawsuit pays tiny settlement to creator Matt fury you know
[37:52.040 --> 37:57.000]  I told Paul the headline was in major strategic victory was a sub headline but Paul does what
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.120]  he wants will probably change the headline but it's got Bob Barnes statement in there
[38:01.120 --> 38:05.240]  and it goes over this so Bob thanks for coming on with us we'll talk to Rendazza here in
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.160]  a moment as well who's been doing a great job piloting this up to this point with you
[38:10.160 --> 38:16.760]  that came on recently get into why we did this and how big a deal this is well it's
[38:16.760 --> 38:20.880]  really it's an extraordinary outcome and an extraordinary victory because to set this
[38:20.880 --> 38:27.040]  up you had one of this was the first major case involving info wars in federal district
[38:27.040 --> 38:33.440]  court you had one of the biggest corporate law firms in the country in Winston and strong
[38:33.440 --> 38:38.720]  they employed as many as five different lawyers on this case might it would not surprise me
[38:38.720 --> 38:44.000]  at all if they spent over a million dollars in legal fees prosecuting this case they were
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.280]  seeking a million dollars seven figure plus damages potentially in the millions of dollars
[38:50.280 --> 38:56.680]  it was intended to be the beginning of a death blow info wars and instead and you had Mark
[38:56.680 --> 39:01.880]  Rendazza's firm which did fantastic work on the case across board established a unique
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.840]  precedent in the copyright context and what we always said from the very beginning is
[39:06.840 --> 39:11.120]  that they're happy to pay a licensing fee to anybody pay licensing fees people all the
[39:11.120 --> 39:15.360]  time who established that they in fact have a copyright but what we're not willing to
[39:15.360 --> 39:21.520]  do is to roll over and play dead we're not willing to let bullies bully we're not let
[39:21.520 --> 39:27.640]  it willing to let democratic party advocates use law fair to try to bankrupt their politically
[39:27.640 --> 39:31.800]  disfavored defendants that's what we have made clear from the inception so this is an
[39:31.800 --> 39:36.640]  extraordinary outcome across the board an extraordinary victory across the board in
[39:36.640 --> 39:41.480]  particular in that context for all the people out there that are faced something in life
[39:41.480 --> 39:45.080]  whether it's in law or outside of the law where they're the underdog where they're
[39:45.080 --> 39:48.960]  the little guy where they're the David against the lies where they're the person getting
[39:48.960 --> 39:53.840]  bullied and they think they have no chance to resist no chance to succeed no chance to
[39:53.840 --> 39:59.240]  prevail just look at this case where info wars took on one of the biggest most powerful
[39:59.240 --> 40:04.840]  corporate law firms in the world against lawyers that get paid thousands of dollars an hour
[40:04.840 --> 40:09.720]  for their work that was willing to spend millions to try to come at when forward and at the
[40:09.720 --> 40:16.160]  very end of the case they acknowledged they conceded they folded they they admitted that
[40:16.160 --> 40:20.120]  in fact it was not a million dollar case this was not some big case they were not going
[40:20.120 --> 40:24.520]  to have any success in court against info wars they were going that you fought back
[40:24.520 --> 40:30.320]  so effectively so persuasively that the net effect is that info wars today basically wrote
[40:30.320 --> 40:35.000]  a very small fifteen thousand dollar check to reflect an honest licensing fee which we're
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.840]  always happy to pay anybody who honestly owns a copyright but we're not willing to do is
[40:39.840 --> 40:44.640]  to ever folder capitulate the people trying to wage politicized warfare and seek million
[40:44.640 --> 40:48.760]  dollar dam I agree let's look let's bring mark ronda's in the both of you can go back
[40:48.760 --> 40:53.040]  and forth on this but this was a big first mimic case this wilmer hail the biggest firm
[40:53.040 --> 40:57.960]  in the country democrat firm has gone after hundreds of people and they've been capitulating
[40:57.960 --> 41:02.720]  rolling over this I still say it's your free speech fair use a little bitty frog up in
[41:02.720 --> 41:06.960]  the corner just something a listener put together we sold it barely sold but I thought
[41:06.960 --> 41:10.920]  it and spent over a hundred thousand dollars against their millions because I wasn't going
[41:10.920 --> 41:14.720]  to bend over and you know to the next person the next person the next person to the gang
[41:14.720 --> 41:18.040]  right and when the judge was I read the transcripts when you guys were in court few weeks ago
[41:18.040 --> 41:21.800]  doing a great job said hey your maximum damage is fourteen thousand but I still want you
[41:21.800 --> 41:26.040]  guys to settle this you don't clock the courts up I respect the judge mark overall what do
[41:26.040 --> 41:32.200]  you think of this decision mark ronda's oh I mean I look when when they come at us first
[41:32.200 --> 41:38.200]  saying they want one point two million dollars in attorneys fees and then they wind up begging
[41:38.200 --> 41:43.320]  us for a pittance of a settlement I think that's that's grounds for a victory lap I
[41:43.320 --> 41:48.280]  mean the amount that you wound up paying them for a licensing fee I mean when we were calculating
[41:48.280 --> 41:53.960]  what it would have cost for you know your your first class flight to LA the kind of hotels
[41:53.960 --> 41:57.960]  that we like to stay in and the kind of meals we like to eat I think I think our bar tab
[41:57.960 --> 42:03.520]  would have been more than that now LA just for the week so I stay at a holiday and express
[42:03.520 --> 42:07.360]  I'm more like I'm not rich like Warren Buffett but I'm kind of Warren Buffett guy but I mean
[42:07.360 --> 42:10.760]  just the money it would cost to do it and fight it I kind of agree with what you said
[42:10.760 --> 42:13.120]  like that well we're gonna come back you're gonna be able to get in the smart but what
[42:13.120 --> 42:16.880]  the judge said like look he told them what two weeks ago you're not getting any money
[42:16.880 --> 42:20.640]  and he told us hey you're not gonna get the copyright so basically the judge kind of
[42:20.640 --> 42:24.640]  already ruled didn't he well I don't know that he said we weren't gonna get the copyright
[42:24.640 --> 42:32.280]  the the judge said that it was a as a matter of law it wasn't a rip off of the Pepe the
[42:32.280 --> 42:37.560]  Toad I honestly think that if that had gone up on appeal that would have been reversed
[42:37.560 --> 42:41.800]  um but hey that was that was you're gonna get the floor when we come back Mark Rendazza
[42:41.800 --> 42:45.440]  Bob Barnes here with us this is a big first amendment case it's not about me and Pepe
[42:45.440 --> 42:49.040]  and all this other stuff but I tell you it's my attention crew comes up and says hey an
[42:49.040 --> 42:54.160]  artist made this poster with the symbols 20 something symbols of the campaign I go okay
[42:54.160 --> 42:58.520]  sure we'll sell it barely sells I get super millions over this is crazy we'll be right
[42:58.520 --> 43:08.800]  back so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.720]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[43:13.720 --> 43:19.200]  one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[43:19.200 --> 43:24.720]  it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured
[43:24.720 --> 43:29.040]  little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes
[43:29.040 --> 43:33.320]  up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting
[43:33.320 --> 43:36.720]  info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether it's
[43:36.720 --> 43:40.880]  five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.280]  compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time
[43:45.280 --> 43:49.920]  support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they want to
[43:49.920 --> 43:54.200]  see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate American democratic expression
[43:54.200 --> 43:58.440]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets

[47:26.560 --> 47:30.880]  hour on the big free speech battles that are happening to front page cover the new york
[47:30.880 --> 47:38.960]  times declaring war on mainline kind of progressives that are pro free speech like rubin and and
[47:38.960 --> 47:44.600]  people and you know calling everybody extremist and brainwashers i mean they are scared they
[47:44.600 --> 47:50.800]  admit because we are popular and they want us off air and trump is now not just signaling
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.920]  he's saying he is going to take action we'll talk about it with paul watson next hour but
[47:54.920 --> 48:00.720]  going back to mark ron dazza we literally just did like 11 20 so 20 something minutes
[48:00.720 --> 48:04.960]  ago settled this case we could have kept hammering and we could have taken the court we could
[48:04.960 --> 48:11.400]  have embarrassed them with fury saying i don't own this everybody can use this frog in 2015
[48:11.400 --> 48:15.880]  he admitted in deposition he really said that my god use it anybody can use it we have some
[48:15.880 --> 48:20.840]  composite with a little frog up in the corner and then they they say we've stolen his frog
[48:20.840 --> 48:26.960]  and done all this so it is a big deal and they wanted millions of dollars and when they spent
[48:26.960 --> 48:30.960]  over a million dollars hell they sent four lawyers here all the depositions all the time
[48:30.960 --> 48:36.400]  we deposed them all their briefs all their propaganda but my biggest thing mark ron dazza
[48:36.400 --> 48:43.280]  was hillary in her alt right speech two months before the election 2016 said and this frog
[48:43.280 --> 48:47.800]  it's white supremacist well no one was even saying that then it was a joke when she said
[48:47.800 --> 48:53.640]  that it got even bigger and so they say jones sued for using the white supremacist frog
[48:53.640 --> 48:58.320]  well they're the ones that made it white supremacist i have nothing to do with that so it's just
[48:58.320 --> 49:04.280]  it's so many levels this weird sigh up of this frog and i get sued over it and they spend
[49:04.280 --> 49:09.120]  over a million dollars reportedly and they're going to destroy me and they're going to get
[49:09.120 --> 49:14.520]  2.4 million and then now it's 15,000 because we didn't blink going into trial and we'd
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.520]  be stupid i guess to go into the trial even though we'd win what will we get we don't
[49:18.520 --> 49:25.000]  want the stupid frog mark ron dazza yeah i mean look it it would have been i think
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.960]  we've gone to trial i can't imagine a jury looking at his statements where he released
[49:30.960 --> 49:36.080]  this thing to the public and saying that they believed him that that's not really what he
[49:36.080 --> 49:42.040]  meant you know he regretted it afterwards is what i think they would have thought but
[49:42.040 --> 49:47.120]  you know at the end of the day you gotta make smart decisions and fight another day and
[49:47.120 --> 49:50.560]  again like i was saying before i mean this is this this amount that you settled this
[49:50.560 --> 49:55.240]  for i mean that's a that's a bar tab and a topless club you know for one good night
[49:55.240 --> 50:00.240]  so what the heck so let me ask you this this is a great headlines you're putting out mark
[50:00.240 --> 50:03.760]  but they're gonna declare victory so let me ask you this and then let me ask bob this
[50:03.760 --> 50:08.040]  they're gonna say jones settles and says he won't be a white supremacist anymore it's
[50:08.040 --> 50:12.920]  hillary that defamed the damn frog not me we're not white supremacist we never said
[50:12.920 --> 50:17.240]  it was white supremacist i'm sick of them they bring up sandy hook in my name constantly
[50:17.240 --> 50:21.160]  and say i'm doing it they're the lawyers that live off the dead kids not me it's the same
[50:21.160 --> 50:25.720]  thing with the frog they ruined the frog i don't want the frog because hillary turned
[50:25.720 --> 50:36.000]  into a nazi yeah i mean look it's this this kid this was never about a frog you know there's
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.360]  a reason that they went after only people with a certain political persuasion we used
[50:41.360 --> 50:46.480]  it and they went after a lot of small fish who capitulated really quickly because they
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.840]  didn't have the resources that you had in order to fight it and the fact that you put
[50:51.840 --> 50:57.280]  up a wall that stopped them for so long i mean i think i think they were they were very
[50:57.280 --> 51:02.240]  much afraid of going to trial i mean there's a reason that they came begging for a settlement
[51:02.240 --> 51:06.160]  and there's a reason that they took such a tiny amount when you know a couple weeks ago
[51:06.160 --> 51:12.440]  they they had their chest puffed out with seven figures in front of you so look i would
[51:12.440 --> 51:17.920]  say that this should be a good warning to anybody who wants to come after you over politically
[51:17.920 --> 51:23.120]  motivated garbage like this you know you yeah you paid him a settlement but you know this
[51:23.120 --> 51:26.760]  this reminds me of the battle of bunker hill you know technically the british took that
[51:26.760 --> 51:31.600]  hill but that was the end of the war for them and i think that this should be a warning
[51:31.600 --> 51:36.400]  sign that anybody who wants to come for a politically motivated suit against you you're
[51:36.400 --> 51:41.000]  willing to spend the money and spend the time and go to litigation and heck if you if everybody
[51:41.000 --> 51:46.560]  out there wants to invest you know a million dollars to get fifteen thousand dollars you
[51:46.560 --> 51:51.120]  know they're going to get a return of about one point two cents on the dollar go for it
[51:51.120 --> 51:56.880]  if if wilmer hill can run a law firm that way i i would really i totally agree and mark
[51:56.880 --> 52:00.440]  here's my philosophy if i go bankrupt and get shut down fighting i'm going to sleep
[52:00.440 --> 52:04.840]  good at night anytime i think about rolling over i literally can't sleep i have panic
[52:04.840 --> 52:09.520]  attacks i'll be honest but people ask like am i fearless yeah i'm afraid of fear and
[52:09.520 --> 52:13.120]  normally i think this is a real victory it's why we did it i didn't want to go in there
[52:13.120 --> 52:16.600]  frivolously over fifteen thousand dollars have a whole trial and spend hundreds of thousands
[52:16.600 --> 52:20.560]  and i knew they'd still lose but then it would just be spun by the media and they probably
[52:20.560 --> 52:24.080]  have some nut you know shoot me in the parking lot or something i had a bad feeling about
[52:24.080 --> 52:28.520]  the whole deal so i've you know that's where this is going but this is a big deal to show
[52:28.520 --> 52:31.080]  what these bullies are up to and what happens when you stand up to them but i want to thank
[52:31.080 --> 52:35.560]  the listeners and viewers because i haven't plugged this whole hour without you buying
[52:35.560 --> 52:40.000]  the videos and the books and the and the films and the supplements and the and the and the
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.320]  radios and the optics and all the great stuff we sell we couldn't put on one hell of a junk
[52:44.320 --> 52:48.320]  yard dog fight against these bastards so i want to thank you mark for the great job you've
[52:48.320 --> 52:52.240]  done with your brief comment on the biggest uh you know first amendment attacks we've
[52:52.240 --> 52:57.480]  seen now unfolding and the next phase but but going back to bob barnes here also working
[52:57.480 --> 53:01.400]  on the case and helping settle it uh other key points about this that people need to
[53:01.400 --> 53:07.240]  know and understand absolutely so it was fantastic work by the rindazel law firm and the evidence
[53:07.240 --> 53:12.840]  of that is in the outcome you rarely see any copyright to go for a year in litigation
[53:12.840 --> 53:17.360]  the big powerful corporate copyright law firm prosecuting the case willing to spend over
[53:17.360 --> 53:23.480]  a million dollars in legal fees ever settle for a publicly disclosed fifteen thousand
[53:23.480 --> 53:28.560]  dollars sometimes they'll demand that these settlements be held secret or be held confidential
[53:28.560 --> 53:33.240]  or and so people infer these huge settlements that didn't happen here you almost never see
[53:33.240 --> 53:38.360]  this outcome and this outcome is only because of your willingness and your audience's willingness
[53:38.360 --> 53:43.160]  to support you and to back your defense and because of that it changed it the number one
[53:43.160 --> 53:47.160]  thing they have underestimated in the various people that have come after you either politically
[53:47.160 --> 53:52.200]  or in the legal arena or elsewhere is that they underestimate your audience they underestimate
[53:52.200 --> 53:57.520]  your audience's commitment they underestimate your audience's intelligence they underestimate
[53:57.520 --> 54:03.720]  your audience's willingness to support and back each other and you by what they do financially
[54:03.720 --> 54:07.200]  and otherwise they assume that they could come out you just said it benjamin franklin
[54:07.200 --> 54:12.120]  said hang together hang separate we've got the real americana audience and the tougher
[54:12.120 --> 54:16.440]  it gets the more they're in there and as long as we don't back down they back us they would
[54:16.440 --> 54:20.240]  they've been so pissed a few years ago but i thought i was just saying an apology so
[54:20.240 --> 54:24.560]  i get left alone i didn't get that it was the setup my audience got it they were pissed
[54:24.560 --> 54:30.480]  at me well now i get it hey audience i'm not just physically not surrendering in death
[54:30.480 --> 54:36.720]  before dishonor i get what you you're right we're gonna raging bull not back down to anything
[54:36.720 --> 54:40.440]  and that's better i don't even think things through now i can just go with my instincts
[54:40.440 --> 54:45.200]  be a raging bull and it seems like that's the best way to go absolutely and this outcome
[54:45.200 --> 54:50.320]  vindicates that this is one of the most extraordinary outcomes ever the i'm i'm writing a book on
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.480]  underdog great underdog success cases in the law and this will be one of those cases and
[54:55.480 --> 54:59.720]  so you have a the randaza firm a small firm against this big powerful corporate firm
[54:59.720 --> 55:04.640]  all the political means that wilmer hail the biggest in the country it's one of the big
[55:04.640 --> 55:09.320]  it goes back and forth between them and baker mckenzie and cad nARPS and a few others but
[55:09.320 --> 55:13.720]  one of the most powerful and one of the well i mean they are twitter's law firm for example
[55:13.720 --> 55:17.760]  so i've gone up against wilmer hail another contact and they are they put five lawyers
[55:17.760 --> 55:22.600]  on it there are going to be four to five lawyers there that the that's seven eight thousand
[55:22.600 --> 55:27.880]  dollars an hour being incurred for this potential trial that's how much money they'd already
[55:27.880 --> 55:32.480]  spent on the case the and it's been hundreds and hundreds of hours on the case so you're
[55:32.480 --> 55:36.960]  talking about this massive effort to crush you and because your audience put up that
[55:36.960 --> 55:42.560]  final wall that last wall that real wall they were unable to breach that wall and when they
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.760]  realized it they'd waive the white flag and said bye bye and nobody else is going to be
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.000]  willing to no competent intelligent lawyer or other people are going to look at this
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.720]  are political people are going to look at this and say this is a smart strategy this
[55:55.720 --> 55:59.680]  audience is much stronger than we thought much smarter than we thought much more willing
[55:59.680 --> 56:05.000]  to fight than we thought i kept wondering why over the last four or five years always
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.200]  the exact amount of money we need comes in to keep operating like why is it always the
[56:09.200 --> 56:13.720]  exact amount and why and it's it's like God's literally telling me i'm in control you're
[56:13.720 --> 56:17.600]  in my hands this has been an amazing time around does he want to add the other comments
[56:17.600 --> 56:23.640]  to this i just i have a very big feeling of satisfaction when they put as many lawyers
[56:23.640 --> 56:29.280]  on the other side of the table as i have in my entire firm and and then they squeak out
[56:29.280 --> 56:33.520]  the door with a you know essentially it was like you flipped a coin to him said here to
[56:33.520 --> 56:39.520]  get out of my way go go buy yourself an ice cream well compared to what the cost are it's
[56:39.520 --> 56:45.640]  it's true i just it's the hysteria i was in a mexican food restaurant saturday night and
[56:45.640 --> 56:49.560]  i was shaking hands doing autographs with most people in there and i walked out this
[56:49.560 --> 56:55.080]  guy goes f u i didn't turn around and he goes after family and i shouldn't have done i leaned
[56:55.080 --> 56:59.600]  in toward him i said come outside and then he wouldn't get up and then his buddy said
[56:59.600 --> 57:02.840]  i'll kick your ass i said both of you let's go and then he wouldn't get over shaking
[57:02.840 --> 57:07.520]  and i said man i'm not the type of guy around dude but you literally said f my family your
[57:07.520 --> 57:11.840]  mouth needs to stop writing checks you can't cash but that's this modern world with these
[57:11.840 --> 57:16.480]  guys they think it's all like posing they don't get it's the real world i think that's
[57:16.480 --> 57:20.840]  with the hillary worshipers and the rest of them they don't get that it's coming to rubber
[57:20.840 --> 57:25.000]  meets the road and there are a lot of people in this world aren't backing down aren't
[57:25.000 --> 57:30.960]  giving in and we've got the audience of activists that have got the big brass wavos and we we
[57:30.960 --> 57:35.360]  don't just thank them i worship god number one but i say our audience when you're like

[1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:43.800]  the new york times admitting that they plan to take even mainline gay liberals off the
[1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:50.120]  internet who don't support censorship of conservatives claiming we're all dangerous brainwashers
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:54.160]  they've got me right there front and center paul watson front and center mark you want
[1:00:54.160 --> 1:00:59.960]  to take this first i mean this is just getting insane trumps got to act on this well you
[1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:05.960]  know i'm sorry but i don't think he's going to i mean he's had he's had a command of the
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:10.000]  antitrust division of the department of justice for three years he's done nothing about online
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:14.560]  censorship i mean i i hate to say it on this show but it seems like the only candidate
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:20.560]  i've heard from who has any any cojones was warren was warren yeah i mean she's at least
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:25.240]  said she'd be willing to come down into silicon valley like teddy roosevelt start breaking
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:32.240]  up the company so why are they overwhelmingly supporting her then couldn't that be a faint
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:37.200]  oh i don't think so no i i i think she's uh sincere about it oh you think they're kissing
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:42.160]  her asses are scared of her i think so i mean if she gets elected i think she will at least
[1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:47.460]  try um i just don't know that she's going to appoint the kind of people who have the
[1:01:47.460 --> 1:01:52.640]  backbone to do it well i agree with you that trumps talk is cheap i agree i'm gonna come
[1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:55.640]  back with a comment on that but but marins what do you think because trumps now said
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:02:00.560]  he's going to go after twitter they better watch out he says antitrust is coming uh i
[1:02:00.560 --> 1:02:04.880]  mean i i mean i agree with mark he's waited too long but i actually think he's getting
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:11.320]  his engines fired up well i think i mean yesterday he signaled his response to the new york times
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:15.560]  by uh by precisely by by publicly for the first time saying that they need to do that
[1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:21.160]  twitter in particular needs to reinstate uh free speech and so we'll see in the past his
[1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:24.920]  escalation has been personal meetings like he did with jack at twitter when you were
[1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:30.480]  up there then after that he does uh and whether he timed that deliberately or not at least
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:35.440]  it was helpful from a public perception perspective and then on top of that he's now taking the
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:39.640]  second action of the making a public statement directly on twitter and if you look at how
[1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:44.520]  he handled confidentiality issues and sort of the deep state coup against him he used
[1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:49.880]  a similar approach first he did personal meetings then he did public statements on social media
[1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:53.000]  and right when people thought well he's never going to do anything about it he's never going
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:56.200]  to take action on it and for a lot of good reasons they thought that because they hadn't
[1:02:56.200 --> 1:02:59.840]  seen it for a year year and a half all of a sudden then he unleashes an attorney general
[1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:03.960]  bar to do so well that's right and is correct and i hope you're right mark randaza what
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:11.040]  do you think i just i think that until we have some real motion out of him uh i i'm
[1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:16.120]  not going to give him credit for anything yet i think he's he's shown spine when it
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:20.280]  comes to international trade deals but he's not shown that spine when it comes to cracking
[1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:26.640]  the whip on the six five oh area code and i think it's time that he does that i agree
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:32.480]  bob uh no doubt it has to happen i mean this is accelerating when the new york times runs
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:38.200]  a frontage sunday new york times frontage piece there's entirely a fake hit because
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:42.200]  who's been radicalized over the past five years is entirely the left the right hasn't
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:46.040]  been radicalized at all they have the same opinions they had 50 years ago the left part
[1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:50.240]  of the left used to agree with them and the on immigration on issues of censorship on
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:55.560]  issues of free speech on on on issues of the dangers of politicized radicalized islam
[1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:59.320]  over the left is the one that's gone nuts is a wide range of studies on this that have
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:05.120]  been released over the past several years including by the uh a a n e s survey institution
[1:04:05.120 --> 1:04:10.200]  where 10 percent of white liberals just five years ago agreed with the idea of open borders
[1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:14.800]  and now a majority do so what's happening is the mainstream media it's all been said
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:19.040]  by clickbait from the mainstream press they're becoming completely radicalized while telling
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:23.520]  those of us that are still saying that that that we're bad great points i hope you'll

[1:07:14.840 --> 1:07:18.960]  poster walking in a movie theater and it's it would feel like the bad guys were to the
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:26.640]  good guys you look up those look like bad guys it's insane now the reason i cover this new
[1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:34.040]  york times article is the new york times attacks me every week sometimes five times a day and
[1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:39.840]  they have incredible scams on there where they'll say jones created the illusion that
[1:07:39.840 --> 1:07:47.840]  something called globalism exist when it doesn't exist it's a white supremacist fever swamp
[1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:53.960]  made up thing that was two months after trump was in office does globalism exist i think
[1:07:53.960 --> 1:08:01.320]  it was the headline davos and the bilderberg group and the un called themselves globalist
[1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:05.920]  globalist means big mega corporations and power elite exempt from all the laws playing
[1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:10.960]  countries off against each other and exploiting the people it's crony capitalism it's it's
[1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:16.560]  the purest form of fascism the world's ever seen and it uses communist states like china
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:23.680]  to be its teeth to just chew up human populations and it's like hillary calling pepper the frog
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:28.160]  white supremacist when nobody was saying that it makes it that are saying if you don't want
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:33.360]  global government and foreign banks run your country why you don't like jews really goldman
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:38.120]  sacks and and and the Rothschild groups and all these groups are trying to shut down israel
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:42.600]  they're trying to get rid of bids about yahu they want world government summer jews summer
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:48.160]  whatever point is they're globalists the chai comms are the biggest globalists there are
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:55.320]  because that's a fact they own our most of our debt they bought a polywood that's a fact
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:59.560]  but the white supremacist that are mainly synthetic on a short leash from a southern
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:05.080]  poverty loss center in the adl oh they tell you i'm the trader you see i'm the first to
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:10.440]  be banned i'm the most banned i'm the most line about and then the final coup de gras
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:17.200]  is that i'm working for israel because i don't blame israel for everything because that's
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:24.840]  a distraction other leftist NGOs in israel flooding europe with islamists that they would
[1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:29.960]  never bring into israel damn right those leftist hate america damn right but they're just like
[1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:34.880]  a black leftist or a brown leftist or a christian leftist or a whatever leftist they're leftist
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:41.120]  and that's why the israel thing becomes this mental illness that sucks all the oxygen out
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:47.440]  of the room and is stupid but it's the same thing you got the vatican runs it all or the
[1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:54.480]  freemasons run it all or oh look jones did the a ok symbol it's illuminati it's mental
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:10:06.080]  illness you judge someone by what they produce what they stand for for their track record
[1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:12.080]  my track record is victory for free market and individuals because that's my stated goal
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:18.320]  and i preach it and it's the truth and it's successful the only manipulation can be at
[1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:23.280]  a subconscious level and i want to pull awesome the next three segments or the segment the
[1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:28.800]  next is that i was in love with free market in love with america and in love with success
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:33.760]  and in love with thousands of different angles and ideas and i knew that free market wasn't
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:40.080]  perfect but it it gave you hundreds of medical choices hundreds of education choices thousands
[1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:45.440]  thousands of choices of everything and then i went to third world countries and i went to
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:49.840]  communist countries and i witnessed it and they'd had two pairs of clothes they didn't have toilet
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:57.040]  paper to wipe their asses even though they had 130 iqs on average in russia some of the highest
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:04.720]  iqs in the world they couldn't wipe their ass because they were under globalism a system meant
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:11.520]  to dominate and control them oh the globalists took over russia in 1917 they turned it from
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:15.680]  the country it was to the country it is and then they went back to the country they were but in
[1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:20.720]  the modern fashion so you hear it's a russian conspiracy against the new world order it's true
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:26.640]  the russians don't direct this we don't talk to them the russians can barely keep their country
[1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:34.720]  from the globalist but they were the first in the 20th century and the 21st century right as the dawn
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:41.520]  of the new millennium began to throw some of the oligarchs off their back and that example if you let
[1:11:41.520 --> 1:11:48.080]  one aunt stand up they might all stand up but america always does it bigger and better don't we
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:53.760]  we adopt whatever's successful we do it bigger and better and we saw what russia did
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:12:00.400]  and we saw all the other victories we said we can do it better than that and so i was there
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:05.360]  betting on that the whole time and along came donald trump a beautiful opportunist
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:14.160]  by the way i'm an opportunist i'm a trailblazer too but i'm i'm everything i'm evil too but i'm
[1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:18.000]  good runs my life god's in control of me but i can see into every avenue
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:23.280]  and i remember like being in high school and some guys being a jerk to the his hot girlfriend
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:27.760]  or college treating her like crap she's she's leaving the party i'm like hey sweetheart
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:34.080]  i'm not gonna be mean to you i'm gonna make you feel good and i'm not bragging like i'm some
[1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:39.520]  casanova i just like girls i'm better today i'm married got four kids but you know i was an
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:44.400]  opportunist i'm like buddy you won't treat her bad because she's so good-looking and you got a
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:49.200]  problem and you're upset because whatever you're so jealous you got a girl is hot i'm not gonna
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:55.200]  be jealous i'm gonna take good care of her so yeah i'm an opportunist and i see the globalist
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:13:00.160]  crapping all over everything wanting to dumb people down wanting to poison people wanting to
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:05.600]  turn us against each other so they can run us what type of powerful leader wants to dumb a bunch
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:11.120]  of people down and confuse them and screw them up so you can rule them that doesn't make you a god
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:19.840]  king that doesn't even make you a warlord that makes you a piece of crap and so i'll never be
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:28.320]  with those people not in a trillion years because they're losers and i'm going to kick their ass
[1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:35.520]  up one side to straighten down the other if they destroy me i win if i beat them i win i don't lose
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:42.000]  because i'm focused on justice and truth and americana and i think it's sexy and i'm in love
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:49.680]  with it and i'm having sex with americana i'm in love with it it's like a big sexy woman with all

[1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:21.200]  got us through that crap and got us off the ground so we could have communion with god
[1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:26.720]  in the stars and beyond and that's god's plan it's already gonna happen let me tell you the devil's
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:31.920]  going to have his hour of power it's going to be hellish billions are going to get killed in the
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:37.040]  end but let me tell you something sweetheart you don't think god created this planet so people like

[1:20:55.600 --> 1:21:03.200]  now i'm gonna call joseph watch for the next two segments because this demarcation line of
[1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:10.080]  june 9th 2019 yesterday we're covering this on june 10th 2019 paul was on a well-deserved vacation
[1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:17.840]  came back early to cover all this from spain front page the new york times now the new york
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:23.440]  times doesn't have its power anymore it's disrespected it's got the lowest ratings of trust
[1:21:23.440 --> 1:21:32.720]  but from a criminology perspective when they put paul not once not twice not three times not four
[1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:44.080]  times but five times his image in this and a big full centerfold five full pages about how paul
[1:21:44.080 --> 1:22:00.000]  watson is satan i guess shaitan to the muslims of course i'm in there as well but it's the insanity
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:04.560]  of them saying we're popular because of an algorithm that's a fancy name google uses
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:10.880]  all an algorithm this is what people click on they then serve it back to you i love showing
[1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:18.720]  my daughter's baby bunny and hedgehog videos and kitten videos and i pair my phone to the tv or
[1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:25.520]  whatever and till you turn the tv on it's the latest kitten videos or you go out in the garage
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:31.440]  where i work out and it's fishing videos because i love fishing videos i don't have time to fish
[1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:39.840]  but i watch fishing videos all over the world and google feeds me more fishing videos now
[1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:44.320]  now sometimes i'll look at an all shows video suddenly i get more all shows videos it's the
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:49.360]  way it works they've broken the algorithm they had huge profit losses this year and last year
[1:22:49.360 --> 1:22:54.800]  they admit because of it that was in press releases two weeks ago but it's the new york
[1:22:54.800 --> 1:23:01.120]  times saying that an algorithm is why we were popular it wasn't that we were smart wasn't
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:05.200]  we made good points wasn't that people were rejecting them it was that we were losers
[1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:11.120]  but the system made a mistake now the truth is no algorithms can fix the new york times are
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:19.440]  seeing it no no algorithm can make people love jack dorsey or oliver darcy or any of these people
[1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:24.960]  but what this signifies is paul was called a dangerous person two weeks ago a month ago
[1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:30.960]  taking off facebook follows all their rules and youtube and google said today oh we're gonna ban
[1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:35.440]  all borderline information so borderline means they can always move the borderline
[1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:42.640]  that's how it works and i watch joe rogan who i like and i watch uh what's his name
[1:23:42.640 --> 1:23:47.600]  davi rubin and all of them go well paul Watson got banned but he didn't violate the rules or
[1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:54.640]  i watched him pool oh paul didn't violate the rules there are no rules once they agree
[1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:59.120]  to violate section 230 and take things down that aren't criminal there's no more free speech it's
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:03.920]  done and everyone thinks if they just play along and don't really support free speech all the way
[1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:10.000]  they'll be the last to be eaten instead of us unionizing collectively just through speech and
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:16.080]  ideas not through some central system and saying no we act like a bunch of idiots so paul Watson
[1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:20.240]  joins us for this segment the next paul thanks for joining us coming back early from your vacation
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:25.600]  they admit this is the salvo to take you completely off twitter youtube everything so
[1:24:25.600 --> 1:24:29.200]  like i told you that's why i told you a couple years ago hey you need to start your own site you
[1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:34.080]  need to start your own company out in england you said why i just want to you know write five
[1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:38.320]  articles a day and do all that you work 16 hours a day and i said paul it's not about the work
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:44.880]  big fish eat little fish brother so you launch summit dot news great job and now you agree we
[1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:48.480]  talked this morning you're gonna have to start up a whole new deal launch your own video site
[1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:52.880]  good we'll support it but brother that's what real success does is it replicates and it hands the
[1:24:52.880 --> 1:24:57.840]  baton like obi-wan kenobi the luke skywalker and i'm not doing that with you i'm doing to everybody
[1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:02.720]  everybody has to get involved so i'm not lecturing you while you're here and i got shown late we'll
[1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:07.840]  take the rest of the hour we gotta do this you've got to commit to this and i understand it you just
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:11.680]  want to get the truth out but you're gonna be censored you're going to have to build your own
[1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:16.640]  system so we'll get to that later but let's get into this latest declaration of war because
[1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:21.840]  yeah they don't have any power anymore but it's a it's a view into their mindset they don't have
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:27.280]  power over minds but they have power over the tech over the architecture over the wires over the zeros
[1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:32.560]  and ones and so they are declaring war on you like they did on me and so what is that like
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:36.160]  because normally this is reserved for countries that are about to be invaded how does it feel
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:42.320]  well it feels quite common at this point alex because it's happened everywhere else
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:47.840]  what i think is going to happen with youtube is basically you're going to be able to get on there
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:52.480]  and be somewhat independent if you have less than say a hundred thousand subscribers but the algorithm
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:59.680]  is going to completely bury you youtube wants to be the next netflix so anyone who becomes somewhat
[1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:05.840]  popular on youtube will then be forced to sign up with a giant umbrella corporation that has a
[1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:12.400]  partnership with youtube that ensures their content is family friendly and advertiser friendly
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:17.440]  that's how they're going to drown out all the upcoming independent voices over the next few years
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:21.760]  obviously i'm going to be banned crowd is going to be banned anyone who is effective is going to
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:26.800]  be banned that's just a fact at this point that's the way it's heading the other thing is this isn't
[1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:32.560]  just about the far left demonizing the political adversaries yes it's partly about that but it's
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:39.360]  also about money we've got two headlines out today hbo cancels vice news tonight far left think
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:45.280]  progress website in deep financial trouble they're three million in the whole you've got cnn laying
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:50.240]  off their entire london bureau laying off their entire health bureau you've got vice having to
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:58.800]  take 200 billion in debt from george soros or 200 million sorry they are going bust so they are using
[1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:05.680]  this deplatforming to eliminate their competition that's the point it has nothing to do with hate
[1:27:05.680 --> 1:27:11.040]  harassment doxing and violence because as we documented alex conservatives have been the
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:17.760]  primary victims for the past three four years of hate harassment doxing and violence primarily
[1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:24.400]  from the same mainstream media which is now trying to deplatform us under those very same terms
[1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:32.160]  and that just happened a few days ago with the creator of the parody Nancy Pelosi video on facebook
[1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:36.960]  where they hunted him down they revealed his identity where he lived and this was the mainstream
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:44.400]  media doxing and engaging in harassment against a private individual against their own journalistic
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:50.160]  standards and training which is to minimize harm against individuals private individuals
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:56.240]  what they're doing now is maximizing harm and that's why we see the harassment doxing of
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:01.680]  conservatives over and over again we saw it with the covington kids we saw it with Pamela
[1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:08.000]  gala's daughters and we saw it with the creator of the donald trump wrestling gif and it goes on
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:12.160]  and on so dying corporate dying corporate media we're gonna come back and talk about this their
[1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:18.320]  only position now with no viewers is to at least be the distractionary diversion of big tech to
[1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:23.440]  basically call for our political execution so that's their final act their final paycheck
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:31.680]  because they're going to be shut down they're being shut down while this purge happens we'll
[1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:36.720]  talk with paul watson on the other side about that but understand that as they shut down their
[1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:42.960]  competition the corporates then shut them down as fast as they shut us down it's like ibm folks
[1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:49.520]  20 years ago in austin we're hiring indians from india to replace them that's exactly what's going
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:56.080]  on now vox and all and vise are just trying to get rid of their competition before they're shut down

[1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:23.680]  by the way we never tried to guns though journalism ourselves into the lead characters
[1:33:23.680 --> 1:33:30.160]  in this fight for humanity but we just believed in humanity and doggedly fought and so myself Paul
[1:33:30.160 --> 1:33:36.400]  western masterminds like drudge who's able to stay out of the fray but still do great work
[1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:45.280]  it's just incredible you know matt drudge hardly ever even links to us but doesn't matter when he
[1:33:45.280 --> 1:33:51.120]  does link to us it's always the most important story that i don't even recognize is the most
[1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:57.760]  important story like for days it's linked up on drudge our article about people coming in from
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:03.040]  congo infested with Ebola scared they've got Ebola it's not hundreds it's thousands i talked to the
[1:34:03.040 --> 1:34:07.680]  board patrol today and i was talking to the board patrol like 8 a.m this morning
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:14.480]  they're like yeah no you know we we like you alex but we went to fox first and we went to glenn
[1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:19.280]  back and we went to you know everybody and then i'm got back with us like this is a pretty big deal
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:24.160]  like we think a thousand more is our estimate just came across the last few days we're pretty sure
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:28.960]  Ebola is going to get into texas and this is the type of environment it's going to spread in is inside
[1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:33.120]  a refugee center these people tell us they're fleeing Ebola we don't even have beds for them
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:41.440]  and i'm not wishing i had the scoop i'm only getting the scoop because
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:46.640]  i'm like the other girl at the prom you know at the end of the night
[1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:51.360]  the other girl's already gone home but i guess i'll do whatever in the back of the truck
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:58.000]  i mean that's scary as hell that the board patrol is all freaked out about this
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:04.880]  and all this is going on and it's us again and then drudge doesn't care where the ugly girl
[1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:09.680]  i don't mean that mean other girls so all girls i think are pretty well where the other you want
[1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:13.840]  i mean drudge still links to us because he knows it's important he knows it's real we have the proof
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:22.240]  that's a scary thing man i don't want to be the guy that's always breaking stuff like this because
[1:35:22.240 --> 1:35:28.080]  that means there's not many of us and that's scary yeah it's on local news but that's it
[1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:33.600]  and drudge has had it up there for two days right in the middle column
[1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:37.760]  and no coverage of it now as soon as it gets covered and breaks you'll take it down
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:43.680]  but that's the genius of drudge he's forcing that story out well don't worry we've got reporters
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:50.800]  at the border and in san Antonio and we're talking to these people with our french translation
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:57.840]  do you fear abola did you come here to to to escape abola in french they're like yes
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:09.360]  think about that 301 facility 200 another couple hundred another and that's what we know of
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:15.840]  and the border patrol says no we don't have beds facilities we're so overwhelmed 5000 a day
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:23.280]  you're like how's them oh really it's like saying 5000 neighbors come to your house
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:29.040]  and you're three people i mean you're you ever had a party and too many people get called to it
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:34.800]  and you can't even get anybody fed this is a this is a collapse of civilization going back to paul
[1:36:34.800 --> 1:36:43.040]  i'll cover it after you're gone paul but no wonder they've got a sensor everybody in europe and here
[1:36:43.040 --> 1:36:49.840]  because you can't get away with crazy stuff like this if there's a free press what are your
[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:53.200]  observations you've got a lot of points to make i'm running on here i appreciate you joining us
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:57.840]  you'll host the fourth hour tomorrow but paul watson of summit dot news well what do we do to counter
[1:36:57.840 --> 1:37:05.040]  this well we have to go analog alex you have to go old school i mean i put out the announcement
[1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:10.320]  yesterday i'm going to be doing more videos but uploading them to alternative platforms that are
[1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:15.120]  not youtube because we need to transition away from this everyone's going to get banned anyway
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:20.080]  because the levels of hysteria have just reached new heights beyond anything anyone could imagine
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:26.640]  in the new york times article the making of a youtube radical which by the way they paint this
[1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:33.520]  picture of this like dark dastardly serious scenario where this guy becomes radicalized
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:39.200]  becomes a member of the alt right from watching youtube videos so what did he actually go on to
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:46.000]  do as a result of watching all these evil videos precisely nothing he just watched some videos and
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:50.880]  if you read the conclusion of the piece you know he didn't go on to try and shoot up a bunch of
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:56.880]  congressmen like james t hodgkinson who by the way was big you know cnn young turks fan nobody
[1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:03.760]  mentions that he wasn't the pa 69 shooter in san francisco who planned to carry out a massacre
[1:38:03.760 --> 1:38:09.600]  who was following and t for facebook pages nobody talks about that he basically by the end of the
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:14.720]  article it says that he became a liberal so he wasn't radicalized into the alt right he was
[1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:22.800]  radicalized into the far left and they use this term alt right alex the guy said he wasn't alt
[1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:29.840]  right in fact it's now emerged on twitter he himself says calib cane the subject of this new
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:37.280]  york times smear piece on the rest of us quote i clearly say i was an alt light civic nationalist
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:42.960]  in interviews people have sent me his dms they've asked me not to release them but in these dms he
[1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:50.880]  says no i was never a member of the alt right i was alt light so surprise surprise surprise surprise
[1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:56.960]  the new york times lied and again it's a classic communist tactic authoritarian tactic to capture
[1:38:56.960 --> 1:39:01.040]  somebody and then they come out and say oh the other side's bad so so that's all they've got this
[1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:06.960]  oh this one guy we've never heard of he now comes out and said and you read the quotes in here
[1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:14.080]  this is like a five page article and it's got laura southern the sexist racist homophobic narrative
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:19.920]  has been blown out of proportion and sensationalized and everybody knows it uh yeah you wrote an
[1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:24.800]  article today for info wars dot com this should get out where facebook's banned the word honk
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:31.680]  because people go honk honk clown world leftist i've got articles philadelphia to ban balconies
[1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:38.480]  and bay windows symbols of gentrification uh summer is now sexist us say today let me tell you
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:46.160]  i bought a condo next to my parents a few years ago and i put it in my kid's name so they would
[1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:50.160]  have a place to go to college because they all say they want to stay in austin and i already
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:56.480]  got a 16 year old son which might be 17 and so that's their condo we lease it out now but that's
[1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:03.760]  their condo and the money we get from the condo rental goes to their trust for college when they
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:08.720]  were building the condos i said why isn't there balconies why aren't there gates and they said
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:14.080]  oh that city zoning and i checked and it's true so when i read this i already knew this three years
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:20.480]  ago when i bought the condo and they were building it they literally don't let you have fences or
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:27.200]  or balconies because they say it scares black people as if that's even true this is crazy it's
[1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:31.840]  like give me all your money or your racist it scares the black people and this is like with
[1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:39.440]  each kook level 12th dimensional freedom man i mean it's like they just honk honk his racist
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:46.880]  balconies are racist uh poll uh oh yeah cauliflower is racist you know it comes from africa what the
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:55.040]  hell watson well that's the point about the honk honk the clown world meme all this stuff is so
[1:40:55.040 --> 1:41:00.080]  hysterical that to encapsulate it into a meme you can only say that it's clown world and then
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:06.320]  they try ban the clown world meme on top of that going back to the new york timespiece again rampant
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:11.600]  hysteria you scroll down the article and all these images of these youtubers show up then they
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:18.000]  gradually disappear and then when it gets down to the words i was brainwashed it shows just an image
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:26.080]  of philip defranco who is like a center left fence sitting milk philip defranco attacks all of us
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:33.840]  constantly yeah he when you got but his his crime is his crime is sorry i'm just i'm gonna let you
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:40.240]  talk his crime is he's popular sorry go ahead yeah so the the entire premise of the article is
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:45.120]  wrong because the guy was never alt-right and admits to it on his own twitter and his own dms
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:50.480]  and then they try and make this argument that like dav rubin and steven crowder and myself are like
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:56.960]  gateway drugs to the alt-right extremists and the the sole remaining guy on the article as an
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:42:03.520]  example of an alt-right extremist is philip defranco it's just so ridiculous on the very face of it
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:10.000]  that again it's but again you know this is what they use to then pressure youtube to be platform
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.800]  people they had a data society report which was again with complete nonsense the premise of the
[1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:20.080]  whole thing was completely debunked by people who read it but then they present it to youtube and
[1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:25.840]  youtube says oh this serious foundation that's funded by george soros says it so it must be true
[1:42:25.840 --> 1:42:32.080]  you actually drill down into it and it's the height of absurdity every single time there's a clear
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:37.600]  difference between being conservative and being alt-right which means you believe in a y ethno
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:43.520]  state which i and you have never advocated neither as crowd or rubin or anyone we don't want to live
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:49.600]  under an islamic state or a leftist state either precisely then they take it a step further though
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:56.880]  now youtube is deleting historical archive footage from 1930s germany uploaded by history stay there
[1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:04.640]  stay there finish that point the most banned network in the world tom and texas police officer on

[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:26.320]  something so pleasant about that space
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:33.280]  and when you're out there without care yeah i was out of time
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:38.400]  but it wasn't because i didn't know enough i know too much
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.720]  i just knew too much oh this audience knows too much they hate your guys
[1:47:46.720 --> 1:47:48.880]  oh they're mad at me they're wet and they're losing
[1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:55.040]  because that makes me crazy they've had total control for decades and now their power is draining
[1:47:55.040 --> 1:48:01.680]  away like somebody you're in a fight with it hatches you hack their arm off they keep fighting
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:08.800]  forget them 30 seconds or so pretty soon they turn white and fall over to bleed out
[1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:17.280]  but think twice is my only advice that's my only advice that's part of the song right here
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:26.560]  come on now who do you who do you who do you think you are you think you're in control
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:35.600]  bless your soul you really think you're in control bless your soul satanists really think
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:43.360]  they're in control there's only one thing in control that's god we'll just better figure that out real
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:50.160]  quick from this planet the whole universe around us god's a hundred percent real it's been proven
[1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:54.560]  you think you're gonna thumb your nose in front of that you go ahead and throw your temper tantrum
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:58.640]  paste all over us that don't go along with you satan in the day you know where you're going
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:07.840]  i don't want to remember i want to be like them i want to be like all right go back to paul watch
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:12.240]  and i'll have the floor the rest of this segment that i'm gonna hit when i say huge breaking news
[1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:16.320]  there's just so much of it it makes my head spin paul how do we get back on the offensive i think
[1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:21.120]  we'll need to realize that they're tuned in right now they're the most focused folks out there on
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:28.640]  radio on tv on the internet but really without them spreading the word without them taking action
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:32.960]  without them pointing out that hey this isn't netflix this is entertainment this is a real fight for
[1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:39.040]  the soul of america will all be defeated it really is the audience that is the key to the victory
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:45.760]  get into that and then you were mentioning youtube's deleting videos of nazi history
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:52.960]  as part of hate speech crackdown youtube deletes historical archive channel for promoting hate
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:59.040]  youtube is deleting videos of nazi history as part of hate speech crackdown i remember i had a
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:06.880]  girlfriend over when i was in college i had a couple bookshelves and on there was rise and
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:12.800]  fall the third right from sheerer want to pull a surprise and she pulls it out it's a black book
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:22.480]  with a big swastika on it and she says are you a nazi and i said uh well if i read a book on
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:29.360]  you know whatever would i be that i said no why would you read that but see the general public
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:34.000]  thinks if you read a history book you're aware like they think you're showing off it's kind of like
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:44.080]  idiocracy uh that's a fiction but uh it's come true that my old friend put together creator
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:50.080]  hank hill is you know as well he he created a lot of different things in the movie when the
[1:50:50.080 --> 1:50:55.440]  guy knows his rights they go oh he talks like a fag so that's what we've gotten to here is where
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:51:02.080]  people think knowledge is evil they think if you know things you're trying to show off and might
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:08.560]  judge put that so well together and idiocracy so paul getting back to this you know people say it's
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:15.920]  a mistake of youtube moderators to delete hundreds of channels uh that are the discovery channel
[1:51:15.920 --> 1:51:24.000]  history channel you know uh southern primary law center stuff no they want the power to delete
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:28.400]  whatever they want whenever they want it's it they're as you said they're coming after everybody
[1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:34.640]  it's about corporate control paul precisely but it's also about the fact they've broken their
[1:51:34.640 --> 1:51:39.440]  own website as we've documented before with the search engine and now these algorithms are
[1:51:39.440 --> 1:51:44.560]  taking there there are numerous teachers over the past three days who are complaining on twitter
[1:51:44.560 --> 1:51:50.880]  about archival historical footage being deleted not only deleted the videos their entire channels
[1:51:50.880 --> 1:51:57.440]  being removed in one case it was a channel that uploaded their recent videos were like little
[1:51:57.440 --> 1:52:04.160]  girls in 1930s germany playing on the street none of the content was an endorsement of nazism
[1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:09.360]  the channel was deleted it was restored after a backlash but they're literally deleting evidence
[1:52:09.360 --> 1:52:15.760]  of the horrors of nazism to own the nazis you know it's galaxy brain logic there from youtube
[1:52:15.760 --> 1:52:20.880]  but again it shows that nobody is immune from this even if you're not well paul it shows how
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:27.040]  the sjw just want power people think oh this is a mistake it's not they want power over reality
[1:52:28.240 --> 1:52:33.280]  precisely and obviously it was a one-two punch the new york times was the second punch the first
[1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:40.000]  punch was the vox adpocalypse where you literally had a guy who calls himself at gay wonk complaining
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:46.480]  about people calling him gay on youtube when he literally used the same slurs against himself
[1:52:46.480 --> 1:52:52.560]  they can call us nazis far right extremist dangerous people all day long they can throw any
[1:52:53.440 --> 1:52:58.640]  vitriolic horrible label at us but you could use the same slurs that they use against themselves in
[1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:04.880]  a ribbing fashion like crowded did and then the mob outrage activates and the rest is collateral
[1:53:04.880 --> 1:53:10.480]  damage the other thing that's going to happen is over the next few weeks and months more of these
[1:53:10.480 --> 1:53:15.120]  people who have suddenly left the right wing or who have suddenly tried to rebrand themselves
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:20.400]  are going to be shopping their stories of how they were radicalized to all these mainstream media
[1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:27.120]  outlets and then they will use that contrived moral outrage to try and de-platform even more people
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:33.680]  so watch out for that and these are the same left that want to bring in admitted isis fighters and
[1:53:33.680 --> 1:53:39.360]  killers to sweden the uk of the us and and repatriate them because they're good people but
[1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:47.920]  if you watch the paul joseph watson uh or a milo unopolis or a milley weaver video well you can't
[1:53:47.920 --> 1:53:55.120]  be trusted precisely and again the new york times article paints this dark somber picture of this
[1:53:55.120 --> 1:54:01.120]  guy being radicalized radicalized to do what he did absolutely nothing he didn't shoot up a school
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:06.080]  he didn't try to shoot a bunch of congressmen like james t hodgkinson left his cnn viewer did
[1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:11.600]  he did nothing he ended up watching liberal videos and became a leftist so he wanted it wasn't
[1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:17.680]  radicalized into the alt right he said himself he was never alt right he became a leftist because
[1:54:17.680 --> 1:54:22.080]  of the algorithm that threw up these leftist videos and that's the course he took so it's a
[1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:26.880]  complete bonk article alex i'm going to be doing a video about it as soon as i get off air to explain
[1:54:26.880 --> 1:54:35.040]  this to everyone paul i don't want to declare victory prematurely because we're in the thought of our
[1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:41.120]  lives but intellectually on the street anytime you try to bully people or take info from them if
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:45.680]  there's any symbols of a free society left you end up failing and i'm betting on europe i'm betting
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:50.880]  on america and i see all the signs of that i don't see all this working i don't see
[1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:58.720]  this ongoing censorship working because it's almost like trumps letting him do it for the
[1:54:58.720 --> 1:55:04.640]  blowback because he knows they're just gonna push push push until it's so bonkers so maybe
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:10.240]  trumps wiser than we are but i just want to know where's it going next is i was in a restaurant
[1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:16.480]  with norm paddus famous constitutional lawyer murder trial lawyer he's got the big connecticut
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:21.760]  murder case trial he's all over the nose i'm sitting there saturday night he wants to get
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:27.760]  mexican food and i sign a few autographs take a few pictures this restaurant and i'm leaving
[1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:32.960]  and this guy goes f u alex jones and i don't turn my back all of a sudden and f your family
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:37.280]  yeah the footage they're showing us of me at lucy's chicken when something similar happened
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:40.800]  but they did it three times threatening me before i got in their face and when i got in the guy's
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:47.760]  face they all went shame on you harassing us shame on you are you proud of yourself harassing
[1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:53.600]  us are you proud and it was just like they're all like zombies they they say the same thing
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:56:00.160]  they say f u f your family you say screw you man whatever they go oh my god we're being harassed
[1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:07.120]  help us he i mean they're literally like sociopathic demons and what's weird is they're all the same
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:12.800]  they start the fight you just say hey f u back they go oh my god alex jones is attacking me
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:18.800]  go shame on you are you proud of yourself it's like they've killed logic like they start the attack
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:25.760]  and then they get mad when you stand up paul exactly because it's a cult of victimhood
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:32.160]  and that behavior that you see being exhibited comes as a result of leftist radicalization
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:37.680]  that's the point the very accusation they throw at us that we're radicalizing people to commit
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:42.320]  hate crimes and violence that's what they're doing to the left that's why you see people in
[1:56:42.320 --> 1:56:47.040]  mga hats getting physically attacked on a weekly basis taylor medic got attacked like five times
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:51.520]  on video and the cops come over and said i don't want to see your footage i'm going to arrest you
[1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:57.360]  you need to leave they can attack you if they want precisely and the data shows this that
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:57:02.080]  the left wing is being radicalized they're becoming more and more extreme both in words
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:08.480]  and deeds and that is the real radicalization problem it's not my edgy videos about fat feminists
[1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:13.920]  on youtube that's patently ridiculous this is all a con to de-platform people because
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:17.920]  the left wing media is going out of business and they want to eliminate their competition so they're

[1:58:57.360 --> 1:59:03.680]  seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort
[1:59:03.680 --> 1:59:10.080]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain
[1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:16.000]  quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast acting
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:27.600]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms paul and block is natural and
[1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:32.720]  effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[1:59:32.720 --> 1:59:38.480]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory

[2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:49.360]  going to talk to my reporters that are in san antonio and at the border with reports that
[2:00:49.360 --> 2:00:54.400]  thousands of africans out of the congo are coming in and the borb troll believes that
[2:00:54.400 --> 2:01:01.120]  obola will end up coming here from the mathematics and and the algorithms which just means the
[2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:07.840]  statistics they're looking at so we've got an alicia powell report here
[2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:15.600]  current x trump supporters protest presidency legal immigration policy the border is collapsing
[2:01:16.160 --> 2:01:22.880]  i saw the mexican main envoy bitching saying well we can't take all these illegals pouring in from
[2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:27.120]  the world america needs to take them you shouldn't take them we shouldn't take them if they don't
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:32.080]  know they're going to make it in they won't come here good lord we want to work with mexico we're
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:39.200]  not against mexico you've got armed people coming across every day i mean this is just insane
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:48.400]  this is totally insane here's that report from alicia powell that with president trump yeah
[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:53.360]  why i supported the president trump that said he was going to enforce current immigration laws
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:01:57.360]  i support the president says he was the party legal alien i've been fighting to stop illegal
[2:01:57.360 --> 2:02:03.040]  immigration and amnesty for 15 years as the president of alipak which stands for americans for
[2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:09.120]  legal immigration political action committee six of our angel families beck trump in the oval
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:13.840]  office to not sign the secretive budget deal of february 15th because it contained an amnesty for
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:18.400]  illegal immigrants in it and he signed it anyway that prevents them from using any government money
[2:02:18.400 --> 2:02:23.200]  to deport any illegal immigrant minor people are upset with the way president trump's handling
[2:02:23.200 --> 2:02:28.720]  the immigration crisis and it's apparently a manufactured crisis according to democrats
[2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:33.200]  but isn't he doing the best he can given the situation in your opinion on the years in the
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:39.280]  army i've been on on the border along every border state california arizona mexico and texas
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:44.160]  president trump is not doing all he can understand the crisis at the border is donald trump's fault
[2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:52.720]  yes 100 it was donald trump who's who chose not to end docka on day one it was donald trump
[2:02:52.720 --> 2:02:57.760]  donald trump didn't create docka and donald trump bought illegal immigration to the forefront of
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:03:01.920]  our national debate we bought that issue for when we shot donald trump up to the top of the
[2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:06.960]  republican ticket he could federalize calling the federal service all the national guard
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:10.960]  units of all the states you can start with new mexico's national guardian which is what he should
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:15.680]  do and put them right back on the border now that the new governor there has pulled them off he can
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:21.360]  do that here today to speak about my brother who was murdered by an illegal alien uh drunk
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:28.160]  driver and i'm here too to speak out about uh how upset i am with uh donald trump i've probably been
[2:03:28.160 --> 2:03:34.800]  one of donald trump's biggest supporters but back in february i thought he would shut the border down
[2:03:34.800 --> 2:03:39.760]  he does not have the will to enforce the law he's trying to build the wall 1.5 billion dollars to
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:43.600]  try to get for the wall for the past year he's declared a national emergency no no no understand
[2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:48.880]  this he has all excuses the fault is not in the congress because the exact same laws that are here
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:52.800]  now were at the beginning of his presidency when the beginning of his presidency came he had a
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:56.560]  decrease in immigration why because they believed that donald trump was going to get tough on
[2:03:56.560 --> 2:04:01.520]  illegal immigration there would be no future for him i just flew yesterday from el paso texas
[2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:07.520]  and whenever i was in the airport there was lines of illegal asylum seekers that all they were flying
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:13.040]  with was paper documents they didn't even have photo ids we know nothing about the people that
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:17.120]  are coming into this country we're buying them flight tickets and they're flying all over a
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:23.760]  country in america is dumb and asleep right now and whenever you're dumb and asleep you're in a
[2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:27.680]  very dangerous place and you're letting you're leaving yourself out there to get attacked you
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:33.200]  can also deploy the u.s. military on the border like president wilson did back in 1916 when poncho
[2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:38.320]  via rated across the border president needs to do what he can do his full powers as commander in
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:43.200]  chief under article two he has not done that yet he promised to end the catch and release program
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:48.880]  and now we have more illegals crossing that border than we've ever had before
[2:04:48.880 --> 2:05:03.680]  what you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history
[2:05:04.480 --> 2:05:12.880]  this is a digital ai enforced gag order not to say the name alex jones are in full wars.com
[2:05:12.880 --> 2:05:24.640]  this is not see germany level this is racketeering this is cartels mr. president we need your help
[2:05:24.640 --> 2:05:32.640]  we need it now you can take on big tech they saw info wars as a dominant independent anti-war pro
[2:05:32.640 --> 2:05:39.440]  human pro sovereign pro family populist organization so they thought first they come for alex jones
[2:05:39.440 --> 2:05:45.440]  then when people say okay take him off the air everyone else like dominoes would fall the way
[2:05:45.440 --> 2:05:50.880]  to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and
[2:05:50.880 --> 2:06:10.240]  free speech understand that they believe they can take us down they'll take everybody else down
[2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:18.240]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:06:18.240 --> 2:06:43.360]  the story that's on info wars.com that is amazing needs to go viral california to offer illegals
[2:06:43.360 --> 2:06:50.720]  free health care by finding residents slavery's back folks you didn't know slavery was legalized again
[2:06:52.080 --> 2:06:57.040]  californians who don't qualify for free health care to pay free legals who do qualify
[2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:03.840]  california will now find residents who don't buy health insurance to help pay for the health
[2:07:03.840 --> 2:07:09.520]  care of illegal aliens california will become the first in the nation to offer state-funded
[2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:17.120]  health care coverage for illegal immigrants under the age 26 and a cost of 98 million of course
[2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:22.960]  that'll be 10 times that and shore up money the state will find people for not purchasing insurance
[2:07:22.960 --> 2:07:27.680]  so you gotta get fined for non-insurance to give it free to the illegals who are here
[2:07:28.240 --> 2:07:31.600]  with pre-existing conditions are ready to have it done like having that baby
[2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:36.640]  the fines were initially implemented as part of the federal affordable care act
[2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:42.880]  law known as obama care but all republicans on the federal level acted in 2007 to roll them back
[2:07:42.880 --> 2:07:48.480]  reported the sacrament will be nuisance and legislative leaders are reimposing the penalty
[2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:53.440]  as the state level will shore up the state's health care insurance markets and keep premiums
[2:07:53.440 --> 2:08:00.240]  from rising dramatically yeah sure they will wow that's on news wars.com
[2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:09.280]  nnfullwars.com talk about slavery baby it's back and it's cool and it's trendy i was watching
[2:08:10.720 --> 2:08:14.320]  CNN and fox news this morning i was on the elliptical and it was like
[2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:20.480]  both reports were the same it was like asians are suing because they're not allowed to go to
[2:08:20.480 --> 2:08:27.200]  college even though they have the top grades because uh the left's gonna give it the quote
[2:08:27.200 --> 2:08:34.160]  minorities because of racism and uncle tom so asians that study and get the grade they're the
[2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:40.720]  kkk now so they can't get into college it's just it's total discrimination and the democrats then
[2:08:40.720 --> 2:08:46.320]  candid out little prizes to ever votes for them it's so sick ladies and gentlemen
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:54.480]  one president trump google facebook amazon
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:09:01.600]  kaluba democrats against me in 2016 election he says that he's getting ready to go after twitter
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:07.280]  and big tech well he's getting really hot on this issue i think he gets it now let's play a
[2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:13.760]  few minutes of him on cnbc then we have senator josh holly also commenting on here it is
[2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:21.600]  just on the side and it's just you know we're the envy of the world as you know and in terms of
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:27.440]  innovation and technology and i guess the worry is we certainly don't want to kill the goose that
[2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:33.360]  lays the golden egg do you think facebook and google and amazon are these companies too big now do you
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:38.560]  think the antitrust scrutiny is is warranted and do you think they should be broken up well i can
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:42.720]  tell you they discriminate against me you know people talk about collusion the real collusion
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:48.800]  between the democrats and these companies because they were so against me during my election run
[2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:52.960]  everybody said if you don't have them you can't win well i won you know and i'll win again
[2:09:53.840 --> 2:09:58.560]  because we're doing well and we're not we're not the fools anymore we're not the foolish
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:04.320]  country that does so badly you look at india very good friend of mine now prime minister
[2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:10.000]  modi you take a look at what they've done a hundred percent tax on a motorcycle we charge them nothing
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:14.720]  so when harley sends over there they have a hundred percent tax when they said that they make a tremendous
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:20.880]  number of motorcycles when they send them in no tax i called him i said it's unacceptable he reduced
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:27.040]  it by 50 with one phone call i said it's still unacceptable because it's 50 versus nothing it's
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:32.240]  still unacceptable and they're working on it but if i didn't if we didn't have the power of what we
[2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:37.040]  have and if we weren't the bank well if we weren't the bank we wouldn't be talking about it because
[2:10:37.040 --> 2:10:41.440]  nobody would care but we're the bank that everybody wants to rob and that's what they've been doing
[2:10:41.440 --> 2:10:47.040]  for a long period of time eight hundred billion dollars we have in trade deficits with other
[2:10:47.040 --> 2:10:53.840]  countries so you tell me who made those deals we also had a big i know you'd like the strong
[2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:58.880]  defense and it'd be nice to get prices down for those things do you think the united technologies
[2:10:58.880 --> 2:11:04.880]  racy on merger accomplishes that is that something that makes makes sense and i'm the one that i'm
[2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:09.280]  a budget cutter and i have cut the budget but on defense i don't want to do any cutting because
[2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:14.000]  president obama and president bush you know he was fighting the wars in the middle east
[2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:21.680]  i was left a very depleted military and i feel just the opposite i'm very very much of a cost
[2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:26.000]  cutter i want to have a great budget but before a budget i have to have a great military so
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:30.480]  as long as i'm here we're going to have a great military and they're not going to have to worry
[2:11:30.480 --> 2:11:37.200]  we've rebuilt we've ordered many f-35s we've ordered ships and planes and missiles and we're
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:42.000]  ordering the best stuff in the world plus i'm a salesman for the country i'm getting other
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:45.760]  countries to buy tremendous amounts of our military you know you could ask any of the
[2:11:45.760 --> 2:11:50.240]  folks that run the military companies the the different companies what they're doing because
[2:11:50.240 --> 2:11:55.520]  of me i get i get nothing i'm sitting there in the oval office saying you got to buy our helicopters
[2:11:55.520 --> 2:11:58.800]  if you don't we're not going to be happy with you and they end up going out and buying our
[2:11:58.800 --> 2:12:06.880]  helicopters and our f-35s look at how many f-35s japan and other companies are buying so you know
[2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:12.080]  it's uh it's good as long as i'm there i i'm a little concerned about united technology and
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:17.040]  racy and because one of the things that i bring up all the time we used to have many plane companies
[2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:23.120]  we said many many they've all merged now we have very few we have you know the two main ones as you
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:29.360]  know and you have laquid and you have bowing and you have a little bit some others but a little
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:34.240]  bit they've all merged in so it's hard to negotiate when you have two companies and sometimes you get
[2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:40.640]  one bid when we had 10 and 12 companies that that may not be sustainable because they all go bust and
[2:12:40.640 --> 2:12:45.840]  so that's the purpose of what they did but nevertheless it's i can tell you because i get
[2:12:45.840 --> 2:12:51.920]  involved in negotiation i i got the plane cost down a lot so when i hear united technologies
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:57.440]  which is a great company i know it well because i've bought many an odys elevator over my lifetime
[2:12:57.440 --> 2:13:01.680]  it's a great company but what i hear united and i bought a lot of carrier too by the way
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:06.800]  when i hear united and i hear racy on that which is another incredible company the missile systems
[2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:12.240]  they make are incredible when i hear they're merging does that take away more competition
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:19.280]  it becomes one big fat beautiful company but i have to negotiate meaning the united states has
[2:13:19.280 --> 2:13:27.040]  to buy things and does that make it less competitive because it's so already very less it's already
[2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:31.520]  non-competitive you look at the budgets of other major countries take a look at russia
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:38.480]  they spend 68 billion a year on military take a look at china they're 200 250 billion a year
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:44.080]  well we're many times that and part of it is that we spend so much money and part of it is we have
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:49.120]  no competition we really don't we don't have competition mr president the treatment of you set
[2:13:49.120 --> 2:13:55.680]  aside with with google or facebook just in terms of market size and market dominance do you think
[2:13:55.680 --> 2:14:01.440]  that there is a monopoly antitrust problem with those big companies setting your own
[2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:06.160]  personal feelings aside with them that that needs to be addressed maybe there needs to be an update
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:12.560]  on on competition competitive laws or monopoly laws what do you think well there's something
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:18.880]  going on joe and i will tell you this the european union which is a fantastic group of negotiators
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:24.000]  they actually a very very prominent person who you know well who's in your show a lot
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:30.560]  said the person at the european union that is in charge of taxation hates the united states more
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:36.080]  than any person anywhere in the world that i really believe that's true every week you see them going
[2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:43.440]  after facebook and apple and all of these companies these that are you know the great companies but
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:47.760]  there's something going on but i will say the european union is suing them all the time
[2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:51.920]  we're going to maybe look at it differently we have a great attorney general we're going to look
[2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:56.880]  at it differently but when they give european union seven billion dollars and five billion and two
[2:14:56.880 --> 2:15:02.160]  billion and you know apple gets sued for ten billion and and you know that's right now it's
[2:15:02.160 --> 2:15:06.880]  going on but they'll end up settling they get all this money well we should be doing there are
[2:15:06.880 --> 2:15:10.320]  companies so they're actually attacking our companies but we should be doing what they're
[2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:15.440]  doing they think there's a monopoly but i'm not sure that they think that they just figure this
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:21.360]  is easy money will sue apple for seven billion and will make a settlement or win the case so i
[2:15:21.360 --> 2:15:25.440]  think it's i think it's a bad situation but obviously there is something going on in terms of
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:32.160]  monopoly uh mr trump mr president um you mentioned utx and rafian that it's tougher to negotiate

[2:20:12.880 --> 2:20:22.320]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:32.320]  cvp agents reported an ms13 gang member used a toddler with chickenpox in an attempt to make a
[2:20:32.320 --> 2:20:40.320]  fraudulent migrant family claim what america's emily finn explains border protection officials care
[2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:46.400]  for a child with chickenpox brought to the us mexico border as part of a fake migrant family
[2:20:46.400 --> 2:20:51.440]  in a recent tweet customs and border protection posted a blurred out picture of the child in
[2:20:51.440 --> 2:20:57.280]  the arms of a border patrol agent the agency says quote the male who the child was with
[2:20:57.280 --> 2:21:02.960]  is not related to the child and has ties to the ms13 gang child smuggling in hopes of a
[2:21:02.960 --> 2:21:08.480]  quicker release for migrants seeking to enter the us has been a rising problem for border patrol
[2:21:08.480 --> 2:21:14.880]  agents in april homeland security investigation special agents say they found evidence of fraud
[2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:20.080]  and more than 25 percent of family unit claims adults are attempting to cross the border with
[2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:25.200]  the child who is not related to them because asylum seekers traveling with children can only
[2:21:25.200 --> 2:21:30.240]  be detained for short periods of time and the inability to keep families together while they
[2:21:30.240 --> 2:21:35.840]  complete expeditious and fair immigration proceedings instead crossing with a child
[2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:40.480]  is a near guarantee of a speedy release the smugglers are choosing the timing and location
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:44.960]  for these crossings strategically in order to disrupt our border security efforts created
[2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:50.000]  diversion for smuggling of narcotics and allow single adults seeking to evade capture to sneak
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:55.680]  in in an effort to combat the surge of migrants at the southern border the cbp is now testing out
[2:21:55.680 --> 2:22:01.840]  a rapid dna program to speed up the process to uncover fraudulent families but migrants are
[2:22:01.840 --> 2:22:06.720]  attempting to enter the us illegally at higher rates than border protection agents can keep up
[2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:11.680]  with had a gentleman in guatemal last week tell me that everybody knows that bringing a child is a
[2:22:11.680 --> 2:22:17.360]  passport for migration right now uh and and so we have to take additional measures at the border
[2:22:17.360 --> 2:22:23.520]  and we've done that we have hsi teams now about 500 uh special agents working this issue nationally
[2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:28.720]  140 on the border even with record breaking apprehensions at the southern border migrants
[2:22:28.720 --> 2:22:33.600]  continue to find loopholes in the system like smuggling children as part of fake families
[2:22:33.600 --> 2:22:40.720]  to illegally sneak their way into the us emily finne won america news you gotta love too if you're
[2:22:40.720 --> 2:22:45.680]  watching our tv feed of this we're a radio listener you don't see it they're waving their foreign
[2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:52.240]  flags and they've been at these un brainwashing camps that even jordan klepper has a show on uh
[2:22:53.040 --> 2:22:57.520]  comedy central with the clintons that they're involved in it they're on the show they reportedly
[2:22:57.520 --> 2:23:04.480]  are financing it where they take them in in texas and georgia and everywhere and brainwash them to
[2:23:04.480 --> 2:23:10.240]  hate america so they get here they're waving foreign flags they're bitching about everything
[2:23:11.840 --> 2:23:18.800]  and then they're bitching that more free stuff isn't being given to them god help us and now you've
[2:23:18.800 --> 2:23:25.680]  got the congo in the second biggest maybe the biggest ebola outbreak in history thousands dying
[2:23:25.680 --> 2:23:35.280]  and we have thousands of africans 300 200 500 200 100 just pouring across into texas
[2:23:37.360 --> 2:23:40.800]  and again we've got a bunch of reports they're going to be going up on info wars dot com news
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:47.840]  wars dot com talking to the folks then admitting they're fleeing ebola uh the border patrol reports
[2:23:47.840 --> 2:23:54.000]  all of it will be up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'll tell you this has been on
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:24:05.600]  one san antonio tv station i thought it'd been on more it's been on one san antonio tv station
[2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:14.000]  and we've played that clip but nowhere else they do not want you to know this even though for two
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:19.840]  days drudge always changes the link within a day except when they don't cover it drudge report dot
[2:24:19.840 --> 2:24:29.200]  com right in the middle for two days has had border battle hundreds from ebola ridden congo
[2:24:29.200 --> 2:24:34.080]  dumped in texas and we've got the video it's all right there
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:42.640]  meanwhile liberals mock trump steele saying there is no crisis in fact let's queue up bernie sanders
[2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:50.640]  first and i'll play senator jack josh holly even seeing in who had the talking point from
[2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:57.120]  a year ago the middle of 2018 took to now that oh there's no border crisis there's no caravans
[2:24:57.120 --> 2:25:04.320]  that's a made up thing by alex jones and matt drudge and donald trump from 15 000 here 10 000
[2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:10.400]  here 5000 there he is on seeing in i'm messing up my voice of him it's more of a southern voice
[2:25:10.400 --> 2:25:18.000]  oh we see white people do not know what it's like to be poor now i'm back in my sanders character
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:25.200]  he's like there is no crisis no problem at all lots of poor people in doctrine they did
[2:25:25.200 --> 2:25:31.760]  into communism will work quite well but see dana basch knows no one's buying the lie that lied
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:37.360]  it works he's like whoa whoa whoa bernie that's a six month old or three month old propaganda
[2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:45.920]  uh that doesn't work anymore and sanders is like don't try that with me young lady the world will
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:51.920]  end in 12 years unless you give me full control now i'm gonna play a short piece of the clip with
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:57.040]  the full video again it's up at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'll say it again
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:02.960]  when you get excited and take action we kick ass we win together when you don't we're destroyed
[2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:10.320]  so the story needs to be shared on your email needs to be shared on your text message and
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:16.960]  your facebook and your twitter and your google they may punish you so what share it from news
[2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:24.560]  wars dot com or summit dot news not as censored as much libtards do not recognize it not very smart
[2:26:24.560 --> 2:26:33.040]  they're banning mit and pbs documentaries against hitler saying they are pro hitler
[2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:42.400]  that is the average leftist so remember a url change they do not get here is bunny
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:49.760]  tenders talked broadly about immigration you tweeted this week that president trump's tariffs
[2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:55.680]  were a quote fake border crisis in quotation marks but immigration officials have arrested
[2:26:55.680 --> 2:27:02.640]  or encountered more than 144 thousand at the southern border in may the highest monthly total
[2:27:02.640 --> 2:27:08.240]  in 13 years border facilities are dangerously overcrowded migrants are actually standing on
[2:27:08.240 --> 2:27:18.240]  toilets to get space to breathe well we need to do i mean what trump has been doing and i think
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:24.640]  the what the meaning of that tweet is about is that trump has been demonizing undocumented
[2:27:24.640 --> 2:27:29.280]  people in this country and that's part of his part again they have opened the border
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:38.720]  they have told everyone calm and even a group say we overwhelmed that trump fault that white
[2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:43.280]  people fault mexico says we can't take these hundreds of thousands a month
[2:27:43.280 --> 2:27:54.240]  you got it sounds yes mexico not take evil white america take let's continue with bunny tenders
[2:27:55.520 --> 2:28:00.960]  what we need to do i mean what trump has been doing and i think the what the meaning of that
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:06.640]  tweet is about is that trump has been demonizing undocumented people in this country and that's
[2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:13.840]  part of trump has been demonizing undocumented i swindle colleges and live in million-dollar

[2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:10.440]  from the Congo, Central Africa, where the second biggest, they're saying it's about
[2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:15.560]  to be the biggest Ebola outbreak in history took place. And a lot of them admit they're
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:20.960]  trying to flee Ebola. So smugglers bring them into Central America. They don't stay there.
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:26.480]  They come here because they get free welfare. And there's now reportedly over a thousand
[2:34:26.480 --> 2:34:31.520]  in San Antonio and thousands more coming across because I've made more phone calls.
[2:34:31.520 --> 2:34:37.320]  I've talked to more sources and the border patrol is saying we're not even allowed to
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:41.400]  keep them. We're not even allowed to test them. We are overwhelmed. I mean, we're talking
[2:34:41.400 --> 2:34:48.800]  for every border agent, maybe a hundred to 200 people come across a day. And when we
[2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:51.880]  have due process, so you got to get him, you got to process him, you got a place to put
[2:34:51.880 --> 2:34:56.120]  him. You're like, well, those border patrol, you know, handcultures like, damn, Trump and
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:34:58.880]  the border patrol, you know, they're letting these people go. What the hell's, well, it's
[2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:03.200]  like, it's like World War Two in your France and, you know, five million Germans attack
[2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:11.400]  you. It's kind of a day late in a dollar short. Again, I'm not even defending Trump.
[2:35:11.400 --> 2:35:17.640]  Trump tried to get $12,600,000,000 to just build more emergency centers and get contractors
[2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:26.440]  and stabilize stuff for the next fiscal year. He got one point, what was it, $1.3 billion.
[2:35:26.440 --> 2:35:31.200]  And so now you've got Mexican drug kingpins and people with the guns in their waist or
[2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:37.640]  guns on their back marching folks right into California. I'm showing footage right now.
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:42.360]  And Mexico's like that. Mexico's had civilization collapse. They've had, well, we're about to
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:49.480]  be the same. And then it just comes down to men with guns because our own government wouldn't
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:57.240]  put men with guns on the border and wouldn't give me authority. US border town seeks African
[2:35:57.240 --> 2:36:03.240]  dialect speakers as hundreds of Africans cross from Mexico. That's today. That's hundreds
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:11.000]  more today. Exactly the border patrol told me this morning. They said, yeah, Mr. Jones
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:14.880]  were really freaked out. Do you know why Fox News won't cover this? Do you know why the
[2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:19.120]  president isn't talking about the Ebola threat? Because we'll be honest with you. You know,
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:24.320]  just like years ago, we, we just go down the line and nothing against you, but you know,
[2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:29.280]  be bigger. Fox did this. And I go, I understand. But we know that you'll get it out. And maybe
[2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:33.440]  Matt Drudge will get it out. That was this morning. They were talking about Drudge Lincoln
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:38.920]  two days ago. So I've got my reporters down there and they're getting all the footage
[2:36:38.920 --> 2:36:45.080]  and it'll be up soon. And it'll be posted in the article that Drudge is linked to will
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:49.960]  have new articles out on it. And God love my reporters. They're such good guys. We're
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:55.200]  like, well, these people speak French. We don't understand them. And I said, use a Google
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:37:01.160]  translator because I've been doing this during the breaks, but I'm not complaining. But I'm
[2:37:01.160 --> 2:37:05.440]  just saying, I'm doing a lot of multitasking. I'm like, get a Google translator and ask
[2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:11.720]  them in French. That's the second language in there. Did you, why did you leave? What
[2:37:11.720 --> 2:37:22.800]  are your fears? And they tell them Ebola. You might think that's newsworthy. Does it
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:35.120]  matter? It's in French. Africans fleeing the Congo. Africans fleeing Ebola arrive in Texas.
[2:37:35.120 --> 2:37:44.000]  We have it confirmed. And I'm not bitching, but imagine a normal news editor at a major
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:49.160]  paper would spend days just on this topic. I mean, this is so huge. This is like giant
[2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:58.400]  kahuna level insane. I live here. I have four children here. We're already seeing drug-resistant
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:09.400]  whooping cough in TB. It's everywhere. People are dying than I know. Much less, how am I
[2:38:09.400 --> 2:38:16.120]  going to pay for all the Africans coming here? Because you get a $500 plane ticket out of
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:21.560]  Africa to Central America. And in a week or two, you go to refugee center and you're
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:28.380]  given $1,000 credit cards, debit cards that have no name on it. And then you're here and
[2:38:28.380 --> 2:38:37.520]  you're in like Flynn. It's over. It's over. Finale, complete. I haven't even gotten to
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:47.800]  the reports. And we're all so comfortable and used to this. Bound reporters, they're
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:39:01.480]  smart, sharp people are like, well, what's the story here? See, we've all become so conditioned
[2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:06.160]  to this. Let the censorship next segment hold Mike Adams a little bit the next hour. And
[2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:10.560]  we've got the guest toes taken over. But Mike, what would you call this learned helplessness?
[2:39:10.560 --> 2:39:15.360]  Where the system knows what it's doing. You're a smart psychologist type guy, you know, business
[2:39:15.360 --> 2:39:19.800]  owner, engineer, but you're you understand the real world's about not pop psychology,
[2:39:19.800 --> 2:39:24.360]  but real. What if we're being maneuvered into learned helplessness, aren't we? Or like
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:30.320]  a mass Stockholm syndrome, because we have just sensational evil going on. And the border
[2:39:30.320 --> 2:39:37.200]  patrol and I'm not bragging that I feel horrible has to call me because no one else one TV
[2:39:37.200 --> 2:39:43.120]  stations reporting on this, Mike, which means the kibosh is on it insane. Aside from the
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:49.240]  psychological context here, something very important to understand is that this invasion,
[2:39:49.240 --> 2:39:55.760]  this is a bio weapons invasion of America. And it's being combined with what you want
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:40:01.240]  to me to come on and talk about, which is the censorship of vaccine truth information
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:04.720]  and Gerald Salende is coming up and we'll take one segment from him and get into detail
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:10.480]  on that. But but exactly, it's all tied. They want to censor us ahead of this move.
[2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:15.920]  This outbreak is being engineered to happen. They want this outbreak to happen. And then
[2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:20.880]  they have to completely control the narrative so that no one can come online and question
[2:40:20.880 --> 2:40:25.560]  the safety of the Ebola vaccine. I totally agree. Like you said yesterday, the clamp
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:30.640]  down is the head of the big event. Absolutely. And remember that all the other vaccines that
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:35.840]  are out there, like measles vaccines actually spread the measles in some cases, chicken pox
[2:40:35.840 --> 2:40:41.360]  being spread chicken pox. And they've already got Ebola vaccine ready. Exactly. And so as
[2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:46.080]  the outbreak is ready for a major Ebola scare, I think you're right. Well, it's just it's
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:53.280]  one of many potential vectors of total panic and total demanded control over the population
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:58.320]  that we're we could see that could be one of them. There are others, you know, there's
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:04.600]  cyber war attacks on the national power grid, for example, there's EMP weapons, their financial
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:09.440]  collapse. There are so many things that could be engineered now, but they all have in common
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:17.360]  the total demanded control over the narrative, the definition of what is a fact. And of course,
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:23.960]  blaming conservatives and blaming Trump for everything bad that happens. Well, this is
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:28.640]  yeah, I mean, you just crystallize it all. And I mean, that's it. Why would you collapse
[2:41:28.640 --> 2:41:33.320]  the border? Why would you bring in people from an Ebola infested country and then not
[2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:39.080]  make it news? It shows it's part of a larger plan. And I agree with you that that's in
[2:41:39.080 --> 2:41:43.440]  the cars. This is an insane time, Mike. And Alex, go back a couple of years. Remember
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:50.360]  the the Zika virus fake fear mongering from the media when they told us Zika was going
[2:41:50.360 --> 2:41:55.000]  to take over. And they said that children were going to be born throughout the south,
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:42:00.360]  the southern United States with shrunken heads because of the Zika virus effect. And they
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:04.680]  used that for Obama to funnel billions of dollars into the vaccine industry. Remember
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:11.160]  that? And then that story vanished. It disappeared. There were no retractions. The entire thing
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:16.360]  was bogus, but they controlled the narrative. Now, in this case, when there's a real threat
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:22.560]  like Ebola, then they pretend it doesn't exist. So in the mainstream media, when they say
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:27.160]  it's real, it's fake. When they say it's fake, it's real. That's exactly what we're witnessing
[2:42:27.160 --> 2:42:33.480]  now. Oh, well, there's absolutely no doubt that the Congo has massive Ebola outbreaks,
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:38.720]  thousands of dead. And then unvetted people are flying on airplanes, landing in Guatemala,
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:45.080]  getting on trains, coming up and then coming across the border. And one TV station has reported
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:50.640]  on it and drudges reported on it. Other than that, a total news blackout. We've got all
[2:42:50.640 --> 2:42:56.080]  our reporters on it. Huge, huge news about to break.
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:43:01.080]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman and child that has supported this broadcast
[2:43:01.080 --> 2:43:05.360]  over the years and that has stood with us. And I want to thank all of our sponsors and
[2:43:05.360 --> 2:43:09.760]  all of our affiliates. And I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:14.080]  we've been under. You're our only sponsors. And when you don't buy the products that are
[2:43:14.080 --> 2:43:20.560]  absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on. So remember, you are the info
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:25.240]  ward. I'm not the leader. You are the leader. When you take action, nothing stops you. We've
[2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:31.200]  got giant specials running right now at infowarstore.com that are unprecedented. And if you go there
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:36.460]  and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second
[2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:40.240]  American Revolution worldwide. So I want to thank you for your support. I want to encourage
[2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:46.840]  you again, go to infowarstore.com for whatever the product is you need. We have thousands
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:43:51.560]  of them and it makes this all possible. Thank you for making InfoWars possible. God bless
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:44:01.720]  you. InfoWars, the most banned network in the world. So the info wars model is a self
[2:44:01.720 --> 2:44:06.460]  fulfilling, self supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by
[2:44:06.460 --> 2:44:10.600]  people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another. It is
[2:44:10.600 --> 2:44:15.740]  the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach. It is the one
[2:44:15.740 --> 2:44:20.680]  model that says here's a way to have a self supporting, self sustaining, self structured
[2:44:20.680 --> 2:44:25.000]  little D democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:28.800]  up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and
[2:44:28.800 --> 2:44:32.480]  supporting InfoWars. And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:36.840]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[2:44:36.840 --> 2:44:41.240]  compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time
[2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:45.880]  support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to
[2:44:45.880 --> 2:44:50.160]  see and what views they want to hold. And it's the ultimate American democratic expression
[2:44:50.160 --> 2:44:57.200]  and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[2:44:57.200 --> 2:45:03.920]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and
[2:45:03.920 --> 2:45:09.840]  backed up with human waste and debris. This is from people flushing things that aren't
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:17.200]  meant to be flushed like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products. And so this
[2:45:17.200 --> 2:45:23.800]  is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged. Well just like plumbing gets clogged
[2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:28.240]  and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that and you
[2:45:28.240 --> 2:45:33.360]  may be experiencing back up too. So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go

[2:46:59.560 --> 2:47:13.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming
[2:47:13.720 --> 2:47:21.880]  to you live from the front lines of the Info War. It's now admitted in 2019 that five years
[2:47:21.880 --> 2:47:28.520]  ago, Ebola did show up in Texas, Georgia, New York, and other areas of people were kept
[2:47:28.520 --> 2:47:36.640]  in secret wings. I was reporting at the time at infowars.com. Mike Adams was spearheading
[2:47:36.640 --> 2:47:41.680]  it at the time at naturalnews.com. He's been totally censored off everything just like
[2:47:41.680 --> 2:47:47.040]  we have, because he owns a scientific lab, he has consumer reports, he spearheaded exposing
[2:47:47.040 --> 2:47:51.680]  glyphosate, and we say now it admits causing massive cancer or losing hundreds of huge
[2:47:51.680 --> 2:47:57.000]  billion dollar lawsuits there in panic mode. Look at this article out of the Houston Chronicle
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:02.720]  in January of this year, just six months ago. Texas scientists developed universal treatment
[2:48:02.720 --> 2:48:09.320]  for full blown Ebola, and they've got vaccines, everything else. So why? With the captured
[2:48:09.320 --> 2:48:14.840]  federal government, Trump only controls part of it. They bring in thousands of Africans
[2:48:14.840 --> 2:48:21.080]  to Texas alone fleeing the Congo with what they're now saying is the second or largest
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:28.000]  outbreak ever. And just all over San Antonio are just thousands of people wandering around.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:32.400]  We've talked to the board patrol, they say, Alex, it's not 300, it's thousands, over
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:36.600]  a thousand last few days. And I even found an article from South Texas I showed earlier
[2:48:36.600 --> 2:48:41.520]  saying that indeed that's happened. So what is the left going to do when they said there
[2:48:41.520 --> 2:48:47.120]  wasn't a border crisis? And then Ebola shows up. I guess they'll cover it up like TB or
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:51.640]  a bubonic plague or any of this. Mike Adams, you're a big picture guy and a details guy.
[2:48:51.640 --> 2:48:56.400]  You've already laid a lot of this out, but gut level, just instinctive approximation and
[2:48:56.400 --> 2:49:00.200]  all your research, what do you think's going on? I think what you said earlier is right.
[2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:04.120]  I think they're betting Ebola is going to come in, just like the EU said, just like
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:08.280]  the UN said, just like TPP said, North American Union number six, seven, eight years ago,
[2:49:08.280 --> 2:49:14.480]  they said, we'll use major disease outbreaks to unify hemispheres and to unify regions.
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:21.400]  Well, with a disease outbreak like Ebola, it provides cover for the release of an engineered
[2:49:21.400 --> 2:49:28.200]  bioweapon. So bioweapons have a tactical advantage for those who are evil enough to deploy them
[2:49:28.200 --> 2:49:33.520]  that you cannot trace the origin because they're a self-replicating weapon system. Chemical
[2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:38.120]  weapons do not self-replicate. Even nuclear weapons do not self-replicate, and you can
[2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:44.680]  usually track where they came from by the isotopic ratios of the radioactive elements.
[2:49:44.680 --> 2:49:48.880]  But biological weapons are almost impossible to track their origins.
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:55.880]  So you're saying this is pure genius, is that historically it's a decoy, just like HIV was,
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:01.360]  for a real bioweapon that the NGOs, the World Health Organization, the Eugenicists are tracking,
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:05.680]  they let it in as the cover, then they've got something else they release that they've
[2:50:05.680 --> 2:50:09.040]  already been testing. Well, exactly. Remember, they've been conducting
[2:50:09.040 --> 2:50:14.200]  these tests and releasing these weaponized viruses in small villages in Africa. And they've
[2:50:14.200 --> 2:50:19.000]  also tested infertility chemicals in vaccines. In Kenya, for example, that was exposed by
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:24.880]  the Kenyan Catholic Bishops Association thereafter lab testing. Africa has always been the testing
[2:50:24.880 --> 2:50:30.040]  ground for Western civilization's biological weapons. This is why even the government
[2:50:30.040 --> 2:50:36.560]  of Nigeria issued criminal charges against executives of Pfizer, the pharmaceutical corporation,
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:41.720]  for running medical experiments that killed Nigerian children. And that's just one among
[2:50:41.720 --> 2:50:45.320]  probably hundreds of examples. And that's admitted, so you would say,
[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:52.560]  what's the headline in for this? Globalized and bioweapon mules? I mean,
[2:50:52.560 --> 2:51:00.200]  it's again, it's a cover. So by allowing Ebola exposed individuals into the United States,
[2:51:00.200 --> 2:51:06.360]  they can release biological weapons, blame, they could even blame Texas for not containing
[2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:11.000]  it when in fact it's the globalists that are releasing it. But there's there's an element
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:16.400]  of this that could could backfire Alex. And that is that these biological weapons, they
[2:51:16.400 --> 2:51:21.960]  tend to have much higher fatalities in cities. And it's the cities in America that that's
[2:51:21.960 --> 2:51:29.320]  where liberals and Democrats tend to be in higher concentrations, obviously. And if they
[2:51:29.320 --> 2:51:33.680]  if they're not careful about this, if they release a bioweapon, it could end up causing
[2:51:33.680 --> 2:51:38.640]  massive fatalities in liberal cities, while having a much lower fatality rate in rural
[2:51:38.640 --> 2:51:44.800]  areas, which have natural defenses against viral infections, for example, more sunlight,
[2:51:44.800 --> 2:51:49.120]  you don't have the dark subways, you know, you know, people congregating. So let me ask
[2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:55.600]  you this. Yeah, past behavior is the most indicative future behavior. They just cover
[2:51:55.600 --> 2:51:59.160]  up TB drug resistance spreading, they just cover up all the different diseases coming
[2:51:59.160 --> 2:52:03.320]  from their world. So so far, they just think we'll just practice bringing in 10s of thousands
[2:52:03.320 --> 2:52:07.200]  of Africans every week. We'll just cover up, you know, they bring Ebola, kind of like
[2:52:07.200 --> 2:52:10.640]  they did five years ago. We know Ebola got into the US later admitted it, but it was
[2:52:10.640 --> 2:52:16.280]  kept quiet. But like you said, it's just so damn reckless to advertise that we've totally
[2:52:16.280 --> 2:52:21.080]  collapsed. And now it's this bad. But I just guess they think political correctness and
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:25.440]  control of media will keep it out of the news. As I said, Mike, you've reported it, drugs
[2:52:25.440 --> 2:52:30.600]  reports reported it, we've reported it, one TV station in San Antonio's reported it.
[2:52:30.600 --> 2:52:34.800]  The board patrol released a video a week ago, they called me like I said, and said, Alex,
[2:52:34.800 --> 2:52:39.720]  it's much worse. Can you get Fox to cover it as if I have power? And I just shows the
[2:52:39.720 --> 2:52:45.120]  incredible control going on. The along those lines, by the way, there's some breaking news
[2:52:45.120 --> 2:52:50.800]  that I wanted to mention here today that's exactly related to this is that the MailChimp
[2:52:50.800 --> 2:52:58.040]  service has, as of this morning, started banning the sending of any email to any lists that
[2:52:58.040 --> 2:53:02.600]  contains information about vaccine safety. Let's be clear, they're the biggest email
[2:53:02.600 --> 2:53:06.760]  service out there outside of like Google. They are scanning what people are sending out,
[2:53:06.760 --> 2:53:11.200]  they banned us, they banned Watson completely. And now they're reading what you send even
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:17.440]  on a service you pay for and saying what you can send. Yes, yes. And so other groups have
[2:53:17.440 --> 2:53:21.520]  reported this this morning, I've had tips coming in from half a dozen people so far.
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:25.760]  But I've also, I was warned about this from another source, who also warned me that we
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:29.760]  were going to be taken down by Facebook. I was warned over a month ago. That same source
[2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:35.640]  told me that the censorship that's about to hit is going to censor any online information
[2:53:35.640 --> 2:53:42.760]  that talks about clean water, clean food, clean vaccines, or anything about pesticides
[2:53:42.760 --> 2:53:48.080]  and herbicides. So the censorship that has been accelerating from the political realm,
[2:53:48.080 --> 2:53:52.260]  you know, censoring conservatives and Trump supporters and so on. Very soon, if you talk
[2:53:52.260 --> 2:53:57.160]  about glyphosate, you will be censored. If you talk about the need for water filters,
[2:53:57.160 --> 2:54:01.680]  you will be censored because the message is that all the chemicals are totally safe.
[2:54:01.680 --> 2:54:06.000]  They'll say, you don't need to go to David Hogg, David Hogg famously attacked me and said,
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:11.200]  do not water, it's good. That's right. That's right. So and they're, and they're even calling
[2:54:11.200 --> 2:54:16.200]  it now, they have a term for it. I've been labeled this chem phobic. So if you don't
[2:54:16.200 --> 2:54:22.120]  love all the toxic chemicals, you're labeled chem phobic. So and this is, and it's going
[2:54:22.120 --> 2:54:25.640]  to include heavy metals. That's what that's what David Hogg said. Everything he's told
[2:54:25.640 --> 2:54:30.640]  is given him in a script he admitted is that these are good chemicals. We need these. Let's
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:35.600]  do it. He said, we need your drink days. The crowd's like, yes, we're not chem phobic.
[2:54:35.600 --> 2:54:41.160]  Right. So, so think about what's happening here. Again, the, the potential Ebola invasion,
[2:54:41.160 --> 2:54:46.520]  the use of biological weapons systems. We know the US military has been running biological
[2:54:46.520 --> 2:54:50.840]  weapons research for many years. What if some of those specimens got into the hands of some
[2:54:50.840 --> 2:54:55.880]  deep state people who plan to use this to try to destroy America and take down Trump?
[2:54:55.880 --> 2:55:00.160]  Well, that's why they mysteriously would take Ebola patients that weren't even citizens.
[2:55:00.160 --> 2:55:03.760]  Remember, was it five years ago or how many years ago was that Mike? You wrote hundreds
[2:55:03.760 --> 2:55:07.240]  of articles. We did it. It was like, they were hiding these people in facilities that
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:08.920]  came out later. We were right.
[2:55:08.920 --> 2:55:14.080]  Well, right. And remember, there was a CDC intelligence officer who was part of the,
[2:55:14.080 --> 2:55:19.560]  the disinformation campaign. She filed suit. I think she was in New York. We did an article
[2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:24.000]  on her. She was actually a graduate of the CDC intelligence operation, basically the,
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:28.760]  the vaccine deep state. And she was part of this saying that you can't quarantine people.
[2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:33.400]  Remember that? When they were putting people in quarantines, she sued and says, you can't
[2:55:33.400 --> 2:55:38.040]  quarantine people who have Ebola. And that, now we know why that precedent was set because
[2:55:38.040 --> 2:55:42.080]  it's like 13 monkeys. They've been beta test. Oh my God. Stay there. We're going to come
[2:55:42.080 --> 2:55:46.600]  back. I got a plug once today, folks. I got a lot going on. You got a lot going on. The
[2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:52.200]  news is so cutting edge, so hardcore. I'm not going to belabor products. You're awesome.

[2:56:16.880 --> 2:56:24.080]  do, you understand your funding of this is the life blood and the globalist go around
[2:56:24.080 --> 2:56:30.200]  the clock trying to shut us down. So let me just say this. The credit for what we've done
[2:56:30.200 --> 2:56:36.280]  goes to the audience, 90% into this group. And I just want you to know that without you,

[3:00:05.320 --> 3:00:17.640]  texas command center and the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide. You're
[3:00:17.640 --> 3:00:26.760]  listening to the alex jones show. So little me this batman. You've got the second biggest
[3:00:26.760 --> 3:00:31.840]  outbreak of Ebola in world history. They say it may be the biggest thousands dead tens
[3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:38.400]  of thousands infected in the Congo. And thousands of people are coming into Mexico and then
[3:00:38.400 --> 3:00:43.600]  coming across the Rio Grande and then showing up at San Antonio shelters. And it's only
[3:00:43.600 --> 3:00:49.320]  on one news channel. The news shows people coming across. They don't point out the Ebola
[3:00:49.320 --> 3:00:55.240]  threat. And then suddenly on the news they're going don't worry. We've got an Ebola vaccine
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:01:02.200]  for you. I understand the board patrol is overwhelmed. I understand there's 5000 people a day they're
[3:01:02.200 --> 3:01:08.320]  catching probably double that are getting you know by him 100 something thousand a month.
[3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:13.440]  But riddle me this batman. Why wouldn't they particularly people saying we're from the
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:21.520]  Congo. We're fleeing Ebola. And then the DHS just says which is leftist run still just
[3:01:21.520 --> 3:01:26.160]  release them. Send them to these groups in Texas and then distribute them out all over
[3:01:26.160 --> 3:01:32.640]  the country. We have local newscast admitting that the 12 monkeys with Bruce Willis is fiction.
[3:01:32.640 --> 3:01:38.080]  But this isn't fiction. And it just shows the recklessness. What happens if Ebola gets
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:43.000]  in. Are the politicians not worried. Mike Adams what do you think. Well let's remember
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:47.200]  to that after the Ebola scare from a couple of years ago there was more research done
[3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:53.920]  on the incubation period of Ebola. And they found that Ebola can remain viable in symptomless
[3:01:53.920 --> 3:02:00.200]  carriers especially in male sperm for up to 12 months. So there could be individuals who
[3:02:00.200 --> 3:02:05.040]  are infected with Ebola. They're carrying it. And if they begin to have sex with partners
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:12.240]  in the United States straight sex or gay sex or otherwise they can be spreading live Ebola
[3:02:12.240 --> 3:02:18.080]  to Americans through that mechanism. That's well documented. So it's like a bio weapon
[3:02:18.080 --> 3:02:25.440]  carrier then. Well exactly. That's you know 12 monkeys someone I think released it in the
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:32.080]  airport in a canister. But that's it doesn't have to be that way. It can be put into people.
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:38.240]  They could have infected a thousand people taken the 50 of them who were symptomless carriers
[3:02:38.240 --> 3:02:44.040]  and then now transported those 50 people into Texas. And why would they target Texas. Well
[3:02:44.040 --> 3:02:48.920]  they want to bring down the most pro-liberty state in America. Governor Abbott just signed
[3:02:48.920 --> 3:02:55.480]  a bill by the way that guaranteed free speech on Texas college campuses. And along with
[3:02:55.480 --> 3:02:59.400]  many other bills that he just signed. So Texas is being targeted. You know if you're asking
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:04.280]  why are they get why are they being put into. Remember Obama wouldn't even give like seven
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:09.800]  years ago federal funding for all the wildfires we had. That only happened like 50 years that
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:14.920]  bad in a drought. We have a drought over 50 years. It's all known in Texas. It's cyclical.
[3:03:14.920 --> 3:03:21.920]  He wouldn't even give support. Wow. Yeah. So I think that this this is part of what
[3:03:21.920 --> 3:03:28.400]  very well could be a massive effort a biological weapon delivery system and a cover story.
[3:03:28.400 --> 3:03:32.960]  And again the thing that the globalist love about biological weapons is their self replicating.
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:37.000]  They essentially threatened to depopulate the planet which is one of their top goal.
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:41.800]  I don't have fingerprints. Right. Can never be traced back to anybody. Especially after
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:45.960]  begins to mutate in the wild as all viral strains do including Ebola. There's not just
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:52.280]  one set Ebola. There are different variations of Ebola. And some of them can be more infectious
[3:03:52.280 --> 3:03:56.920]  to people of different genetic predispositions by the way. There can be strains that quite
[3:03:56.920 --> 3:04:01.760]  literally target people who are of European descent or strains that target people of African
[3:04:01.760 --> 3:04:05.480]  descent for example. That's that's well known. This is just straight up science here. This
[3:04:05.480 --> 3:04:11.280]  is you know this is this isn't fringe science I'm mentioning. Like every microbiologist
[3:04:11.280 --> 3:04:14.600]  and virologist knows what I'm talking about. This is mainline science what you're saying.
[3:04:14.600 --> 3:04:18.640]  So exactly. Again the fact I'm going to ask this question. I'm going to break and come
[3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:24.920]  back and get into the censorship. Mike Adams 30 second answer or answer when we come back.
[3:04:24.920 --> 3:04:30.280]  What does it signify the news blackout because I'm going to say this again. Drudge has aggressively
[3:04:30.280 --> 3:04:34.680]  had our story up for two days top deal. He's trying to make people cover it. Hell it's
[3:04:34.680 --> 3:04:41.160]  a local newscast. It's not even us. And there's no coverage. What does that say. It shows
[3:04:41.160 --> 3:04:47.720]  that this is a big deal at the highest level. They're telling news not to cover this far.
[3:04:47.720 --> 3:04:54.200]  That's 100 percent. This story is sensational. And there's a blackout.
[3:04:54.200 --> 3:04:58.280]  You know the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't
[3:04:58.280 --> 3:05:02.080]  be there for my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong now. Now I can
[3:05:02.080 --> 3:05:07.200]  be there for my children. Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can
[3:05:07.200 --> 3:05:10.580]  teach them what I've learned. But not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age your
[3:05:10.580 --> 3:05:14.640]  words gone forever but now they're using better getting rid of what you said they were before.
[3:05:14.640 --> 3:05:19.360]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book
[3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:24.760]  burning isn't it. But I have joined my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed now
[3:05:24.760 --> 3:05:29.280]  as long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people know the truth and you can't
[3:05:29.280 --> 3:05:34.720]  be destroyed either as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through
[3:05:34.720 --> 3:05:39.560]  the fire for it. There is a magic that then takes place the transcend space and time when
[3:05:39.560 --> 3:05:44.120]  you commit the word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos that
[3:05:44.120 --> 3:05:49.720]  overrides everything the enemy is doing. So please now commit to support info wars however
[3:05:49.720 --> 3:06:07.240]  you can and realize your provision to info wars is your own provision you are listening
[3:06:07.240 --> 3:06:20.560]  to an info wars dot com frontline report. It's Alex Jones. Now Gerald Salente is about
[3:06:20.560 --> 3:06:25.880]  to take over the war rooms coming up. I'll be hosting some of that with the crew. We've
[3:06:25.880 --> 3:06:30.960]  got our crew in the field. The reports are about to come in info wars dot com and news
[3:06:30.960 --> 3:06:36.760]  wars dot com. I talked to our board patrol sources this morning and you've seen a lot
[3:06:36.760 --> 3:06:41.200]  of those on camera with us some of them off camera and they just said listen there's thousands
[3:06:41.200 --> 3:06:46.080]  Africans from Congo coming in. It's much worse than the 300 that are at the San Antonio facility
[3:06:46.080 --> 3:06:49.720]  in the one video we released. That's just the video we got we tracked them there as we've
[3:06:49.720 --> 3:06:53.440]  been ordered to release them because there's nowhere to put them and there's no facilities
[3:06:53.440 --> 3:06:58.480]  and we think they should have kept because the Ebola threat and they brought up the same
[3:06:58.480 --> 3:07:02.400]  thing about sexually transmitted and then the crew was asking me about it. I'd forgotten
[3:07:02.400 --> 3:07:06.960]  they can live for like a year in the sperm and then Mike was bringing that up. I mean
[3:07:06.960 --> 3:07:12.400]  my head's spinning at this point and by the way the board of patrols head is spinning.
[3:07:12.400 --> 3:07:16.680]  They said how do we get this to Hannity how do we get this to Tucker Carlson. This was
[3:07:16.680 --> 3:07:20.680]  this morning as soon as I get off air I'm going to make some phone calls but you don't
[3:07:20.680 --> 3:07:27.480]  think Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity don't know all about this. There is a blackout and
[3:07:27.480 --> 3:07:32.680]  orders are coming down. I have been told that by Hannity. I have been told that by Carlson
[3:07:32.680 --> 3:07:39.160]  but believe me I know a huge important story when I see one. Just African migrants periods
[3:07:39.160 --> 3:07:44.720]  showing up in mass is big but from an Ebola ravaged area when U.S. citizens that come
[3:07:44.720 --> 3:07:50.440]  from there get put in quarantine for a month this is unprecedented and then you've got
[3:07:50.440 --> 3:07:55.480]  New York Times cover story. The New York Times is not that important in their reach but the
[3:07:55.480 --> 3:08:00.560]  establishment still gets its talking points from it and when they say we're about to ban
[3:08:00.560 --> 3:08:04.480]  everybody including anybody that's on the edge of the fringe or we're going to ban like
[3:08:04.480 --> 3:08:10.560]  liberals that believe in free speech like you know Mr. Reuben you know it signifies with
[3:08:10.560 --> 3:08:18.680]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com was just saying big escalations and then consumer advocacy
[3:08:18.680 --> 3:08:24.800]  like they're removing off all sorts of review sites reviews of drugs reviews of vaccines
[3:08:24.800 --> 3:08:28.320]  well the thing you trust more when you're going to a restaurant or a grocery store or
[3:08:28.320 --> 3:08:39.120]  a hotel or an airline or a school or a church is reviews. They're saying oh disinfo. Vaccine
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:44.000]  makers and drug makers say you can't do that at one of the biggest review sites well that's
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:48.480]  natural news with their $10 million research facility with accredited scientists that's
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:53.640]  banned everywhere and Mailchimp says we're reading your email Mike Adams we're reading
[3:08:53.640 --> 3:08:58.680]  your email you can't send that you can't show somebody an ABC report of some woman dying
[3:08:58.680 --> 3:09:04.600]  from a vaccine so it really shows panic mode by the establishment my problem is Mike we've
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:08.880]  lived with so much freedom so long I don't think people realize the magnitude of how
[3:09:08.880 --> 3:09:15.120]  serious this is and that all the censorship so far was just I think a test the damn broke
[3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:19.360]  in the last week this is the full assault ahead of a big event I don't think there's
[3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:23.720]  any way to deny that is it a coup against Trump is it mass Ebola outbreaks is it a new
[3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:28.200]  war it's all of the cards what do you think was more than a coup against Trump although
[3:09:28.200 --> 3:09:32.360]  that's where it begins but according to the information I'm getting from sources number
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:40.360]  one the FDA is going to outlaw CBD as a dietary supplement through regulatory control they've
[3:09:40.360 --> 3:09:45.400]  already held meetings on that they're working on that they are completely scared of the
[3:09:45.400 --> 3:09:51.840]  fact that CBD can replace so many prescription medications for certain people you know CBD
[3:09:51.840 --> 3:09:56.280]  cannabinoids are quite medicinal in many different ways and that's freaking out the FDA so they're
[3:09:56.280 --> 3:10:02.000]  coming after that but the bigger news is that not only is Mailchimp censoring all emails
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  now about vaccines and of course Google and YouTube and Twitter all censoring information
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:11.400]  about natural health organics anti-cancer foods is a big one that they're going to start
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:16.760]  censoring now so if you talk about molecules in food for example broccoli contains a molecule
[3:10:16.760 --> 3:10:22.480]  called sulforaphane sulforaphane is a very potent anti-cancer molecule and it exists
[3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:30.080]  as a molecule it's a laws of physics and chemistry right they'll say that it's fake
[3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:34.400]  news they'll say it's fake news there's no such thing as a cancer food but you have to
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:39.520]  take their chemotherapy drugs but if you talk about the dangers of chemotherapy or the fact
[3:10:39.520 --> 3:10:44.240]  that the number one side effect of chemotherapy is cancer then you will of course be labeled
[3:10:44.240 --> 3:10:48.920]  here so bottom line is whether we're wrong or right and obviously we're right they don't
[3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:56.120]  want people having access to all the studies and all the facts that iodine raises IQ lack
[3:10:56.120 --> 3:11:02.160]  of it lowers it that's government studies fluoride lowers IQ good halogens raise IQ
[3:11:02.160 --> 3:11:08.080]  they're panicking and they've just gotten really greedy I mean hell it's amazing it's
[3:11:08.080 --> 3:11:12.800]  gonna get even worse so two more things that are going to be happening number one amazon.com
[3:11:12.800 --> 3:11:20.200]  will be abandoning many small retailers or sellers of natural products herbs superfoods
[3:11:20.200 --> 3:11:23.600]  and traditional supplements they're moving in the direction because he bought whole foods
[3:11:23.600 --> 3:11:30.640]  now he was a monopoly no no it's actually a pressure on him there yeah yeah there an
[3:11:30.640 --> 3:11:36.200]  order has gone out that that everybody now who is part of the globalist has to be anti-nutrition
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:41.680]  anti-organics anti-clean food and anti-clean water and so you're going to see vitamins
[3:11:41.680 --> 3:11:46.320]  on amazon in the future but they'll be the synthetic toxic versions of the vitamins you
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:50.720]  know not not the good form of b12 but the toxic I only big big pharma giving you what
[3:11:50.720 --> 3:11:55.360]  they want right yeah big pharma vitamins which is which are toxic because it becomes too
[3:11:55.360 --> 3:12:00.200]  obvious when all the patriots are healthy and our kids are healthy and then everybody
[3:12:00.200 --> 3:12:08.280]  else is dying you can't have that yeah exactly but but the end game of this phase is to criminalize
[3:12:08.280 --> 3:12:15.040]  online speech about nutrition and health and this was tried already in a state in the united
[3:12:15.040 --> 3:12:19.200]  states where I forgot which state it was but we can look it up where they tried to say only
[3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:24.440]  registered dietitians can talk about nutrition online that was shot down but it was a test
[3:12:24.440 --> 3:12:29.440]  case and they're going to try to bring it back so alex is not just the censorship they're
[3:12:29.440 --> 3:12:33.680]  not only coming after you and your store and your nutritional products and mine as well
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:38.480]  they're going to try to criminalize anybody who says there's such a thing as an anti-cancer
[3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:43.680]  molecule found in brussel sprouts or is that if you don't have vitamin C you get scurvy
[3:12:43.680 --> 3:12:48.080]  and cancer or if you don't have oxygen you die if you don't have water in fact I've read
[3:12:48.080 --> 3:12:52.320]  with the FDA says you can't say you've got to have oxygen to live you can't say you
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:12:56.040]  need water or die in five days without it you can't say you need vitamin C even though
[3:12:56.040 --> 3:13:01.120]  it's a total admitted fact all right mike adams naturalnews.com thank you so much keep
[3:13:01.120 --> 3:13:05.800]  it up a lot of critical reporting we'll talk to you soon thank you alex folks you just
[3:13:05.800 --> 3:13:11.240]  heard mike and it's insane and I'm not up here as the guru of taking the best care
[3:13:11.240 --> 3:13:16.400]  of myself but I know this if I didn't have x2 deep breath crystal iodine and the 30 40
[3:13:16.400 --> 3:13:22.040]  50 pounds I lost on that I never even work out anymore I weighed 40 50 pounds more five
[3:13:22.040 --> 3:13:27.240]  years ago than I do now but the x actually have sunspots all over my skin and they told
[3:13:27.240 --> 3:13:31.280]  me this when you take real iodine it's gonna it's gonna deal with that it's not the same
[3:13:31.280 --> 3:13:36.200]  for everybody but you know yeah worse like david hogs said jones says the ground table
[3:13:36.200 --> 3:13:42.960]  water is full of pesticides and then he sells filters exactly if I was gonna sell cars I
[3:13:42.960 --> 3:13:48.480]  found out what the safest and best value was and I'd go promote that car well the ground
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:52.640]  water is full of a bunch of poison and all the studies show you should filter your water
[3:13:52.640 --> 3:13:56.440]  with good filters that do it I go out and find the best filters for the best price and I
[3:13:56.440 --> 3:14:02.440]  sell those and if I know that turmeric is a great antioxidant and a great anti-inflammatory
[3:14:02.440 --> 3:14:06.080]  and just great for everything in your life I go find the best factory the best organic
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:10.840]  group the already best rated thing that's 90% of humanoid and I go I spent more money
[3:14:10.840 --> 3:14:15.320]  could you make it stronger they go yeah our machines can make it 95% of humanoid you'll
[3:14:15.320 --> 3:14:19.360]  be the best in the country I called three other places are confirmed they're like we
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:25.520]  don't go above 80 there's no point well you know what we got 95% of humanoid it's bodies
[3:14:25.520 --> 3:14:31.880]  and so I'm a superstitious person and I believe mesophysically thought of some book I just
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:36.400]  feel it that if I try to give you the very best and I do the best job I can I'm gonna
[3:14:36.400 --> 3:14:43.360]  win if I think about screwing somebody over or cutting corners I start literally shaking
[3:14:43.360 --> 3:14:47.160]  it's only fear I have a screw in somebody over who hadn't had it coming to him like
[3:14:47.160 --> 3:14:51.960]  Tony Montana says in the fictional Scarface I never screwed nobody over or didn't have
[3:14:51.960 --> 3:14:55.400]  it coming to him didn't ask for it didn't screw me over first so all I'm saying is
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:15:00.240]  we're only here because of you and all the products and for short com are the very best
[3:15:00.240 --> 3:15:04.160]  we can bring you there's a bunch of specials right now and without you funding us we won't
[3:15:04.160 --> 3:15:09.840]  be here in the future to talk about all the incredible things that Mike Adams was just
[3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:15.640]  breaking down because it's not just him saying it it's in the news that they're gonna try
[3:15:15.640 --> 3:15:20.000]  to ban all the supplements they're gonna come after all your speech they're coming
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:26.360]  after your guns they've already gotten rid of your borders that they're just doing it
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:33.080]  all folks it's a bum rush because they know you woke up to globalism so they're trying
[3:15:33.080 --> 3:15:37.320]  to finish 10 years of globalism in a year or two and I think they miscalculated but
[3:15:37.320 --> 3:15:41.960]  quite frankly it's up to all of us how this works out so thank you all for support but

[3:20:36.040 --> 3:20:42.120]  about how you can't come out about not wanting to get vaccinated you know they won't let anything
[3:20:42.120 --> 3:20:46.600]  about natural healing by the way that was the first book i worked on natural healing back
[3:20:46.600 --> 3:20:51.960]  in 1986 and have an honorary doctorate the national university of health sciences the
[3:20:51.960 --> 3:20:56.760]  work i've done an integrative and complementary medicine they made ban me from the internet
[3:20:56.760 --> 3:21:03.160]  to say that no you only got to get drugged up i mean how can anybody think that a child coming
[3:21:03.160 --> 3:21:09.800]  out of a mother's womb all of a sudden is injected with all these foreign heavy duty
[3:21:09.800 --> 3:21:18.600]  injections as an infant coming out of the womb and it's okay we got the research to prove it
[3:21:18.600 --> 3:21:24.520]  how dare you say anything else it's only been going on since the beginning of humans that
[3:21:24.520 --> 3:21:30.680]  they haven't been vaccinating only a couple of what hundred years or so but it's okay now anyway
[3:21:31.400 --> 3:21:38.920]  and talking about the repression of the media one of our top trends for 2019 is censorship 2019
[3:21:38.920 --> 3:21:42.840]  and you know those stinking russians over there having taught us to hate the russians right
[3:21:43.480 --> 3:21:49.080]  as lousy russians they hacked into the uh hillary clinton's presidential campaign and
[3:21:49.640 --> 3:21:54.920]  that's that's why she lost not because people couldn't stand there and they had enough of her
[3:21:54.920 --> 3:22:00.920]  and they showed what a con artist she is along with her husband now that had nothing to do with it
[3:22:00.920 --> 3:22:07.240]  anyway you ready for this and surprisingly this is from the toilet paper record in new york times
[3:22:07.240 --> 3:22:19.000]  today's free speech in russia flourishes on youtube i'm not making this up free speech
[3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:31.400]  in russia flourishes on youtube as they're censoring all of us isn't that something
[3:22:31.400 --> 3:22:42.120]  mainstream television in russia stage managed by the kremlin yeah like mainstream tv in the
[3:22:42.120 --> 3:22:52.040]  united states isn't managed by uh the washington or masters and the corporate john's that's
[3:22:52.040 --> 3:22:57.800]  why they got prostitutes working from this is propaganda the way they write this who wrote this
[3:22:57.800 --> 3:23:09.480]  oh this guy neil mcfakwa yeah fack where yeah you yeah this guy is such a fraud he always writes
[3:23:09.480 --> 3:23:15.480]  anti russian hate the other side stuff but anyway he goes on over here
[3:23:15.480 --> 3:23:27.960]  here barely mentioned or anti russian punk band or pussy riot or alexia a
[3:23:30.840 --> 3:23:36.520]  navagna yes so i haven't mentioned two people in the media hey they don't mention need on
[3:23:36.520 --> 3:23:40.840]  america media anymore i just found all the time he's found an old praise beyond the today's show
[3:23:40.840 --> 3:23:47.080]  but good morning america yeah i guess they got that russian influence on i guess they banned me anyway
[3:23:49.800 --> 3:23:55.960]  the entire social political part of television is controlled by the authorities says lennard j
[3:23:58.920 --> 3:24:05.480]  harfanoff an independent news analyst who has been shut out this is how they quote one guy
[3:24:05.480 --> 3:24:12.760]  but anyway yet voices that the government would mute are heard regularly by tens of millions of
[3:24:12.760 --> 3:24:26.920]  russians in another format youtube while they ban us here censorship 2019 today i want to do a
[3:24:26.920 --> 3:24:34.680]  little bit of trend tracking current events form future trends they don't teach you this in school
[3:24:34.680 --> 3:24:40.440]  you only learn about history and you got to memorize the dates they give you stupid tests to
[3:24:40.440 --> 3:24:45.480]  make sure you memorize them yeah it's important to know history because tracking trends is an
[3:24:45.480 --> 3:24:51.000]  understanding of where we are how we got here where we're going but where we're going it's off base
[3:24:52.200 --> 3:25:01.480]  can't find a university in the ussa it teaches you how to look ahead anywhere else so i want to show you
[3:25:01.480 --> 3:25:10.760]  you how current events form future trends this isn't reported in the prostitute media
[3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:18.600]  you know there's five g new technology we've been writing a lot about in the trends journal
[3:25:18.600 --> 3:25:24.600]  mr tucci one of our experts writes about it is deadly stuff his study after study coming out
[3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:32.920]  they banned it in brussels that's right and now prime minister of poland signs global appeal
[3:25:33.480 --> 3:25:40.680]  to stop 5g telecommunications transmission this is from globalresearch.ca
[3:25:42.840 --> 3:25:48.040]  and what is surely an unprecedented groundbreaking action the prime minister of poland has personally
[3:25:48.040 --> 3:25:54.360]  backed an international appeal to stop the controversial rollout of 5g electromagnetic
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:26:00.840]  microwave telecommunication transmissions we've done a lot of work on this
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:08.680]  there have been no safety tests carried out to ensure its safety in spite of the fact that 5g
[3:26:08.680 --> 3:26:15.960]  operates at between 10 and 100 times higher frequencies than current 3 and 4g cell phone tower
[3:26:15.960 --> 3:26:24.520]  transmitters and now these are going to be in a neighborhood on a block on a telephone pole on
[3:26:24.520 --> 3:26:34.200]  a pole next to you up and down the neighborhood the hoods that's right the murderers are going to
[3:26:34.200 --> 3:26:39.560]  put this out the same people you know that we were manufacturing years ago like we had
[3:26:39.560 --> 3:26:46.120]  general electric they had all the pcbs they dumped in the hudson river yeah they know they're
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:51.160]  doing this stuff but they're greedy sobs that'll do anything to make a buck
[3:26:55.240 --> 3:27:01.640]  5g rollout will involve the placement of millions of transmitter boxes at distances of no more
[3:27:01.640 --> 3:27:10.760]  than 10 to 12 houses apart in urban areas scientists have established that this will
[3:27:10.760 --> 3:27:18.040]  subject citizens living in urban areas to unavoidable barrage of electromagnetic pollution
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:21.160]  this is serious
[3:27:23.560 --> 3:27:28.760]  there's even studies on cell phones as well but they're ignored and probably they'll ban them from
[3:27:28.760 --> 3:27:41.160]  youtube and twitter facebook yep so tune into this get hip with it and try to stop it because it
[3:27:41.160 --> 3:27:46.760]  can be stopped matter of fact up here in woodstock not far from us over here i'm in kingston new york
[3:27:46.760 --> 3:27:55.880]  15 minutes away they're protesting 5g so i want to talk a lot today about a number of different
[3:27:55.880 --> 3:28:02.120]  issues and of course the jobs report that came out on friday

[3:33:57.960 --> 3:34:03.320]  of course the transjournal and the rest of us that are not the prostitutes that say what we
[3:34:03.320 --> 3:34:11.800]  believe not what we're told to do and that's all it is out there bunch of people getting paid to
[3:34:11.800 --> 3:34:20.360]  put out they call it the media now i told you i want to do some things on what tracking trends
[3:34:20.360 --> 3:34:27.560]  really mean so i mentioned about the jobs jobs that are being created because of the monopolies
[3:34:27.560 --> 3:34:33.240]  that run everything in slave land in a country near you the merger and acquisition activity
[3:34:34.440 --> 3:34:40.440]  they fire who they want and control what they want like when i was a young guy they had things
[3:34:40.440 --> 3:34:46.760]  called stationary stores rather than staples and office depot took over and there were hardware
[3:34:46.760 --> 3:34:59.240]  stores before loaves and home depot took over and there were mom and pop shops clothing women's
[3:34:59.240 --> 3:35:10.200]  show shops men's shops shoe shops one after another before the macy's the targets and the walmots took
[3:35:10.200 --> 3:35:19.640]  over so the jobs that are being created don't pay a lot of money so this is from latest information
[3:35:19.640 --> 3:35:28.280]  out cnbc so you know that you know they're not cooking it to make it sound bad they're trying
[3:35:28.280 --> 3:35:34.120]  to make it sound better the 10 jobs experiencing the fastest pay growth right now
[3:35:36.200 --> 3:35:45.560]  number one a pharmacy technician $31,000 number two a machine operator well that's good $40,000
[3:35:46.760 --> 3:35:51.800]  but hey guess what do you know how much manufacturing we do in the united states
[3:35:51.800 --> 3:36:01.640]  it's only 11% of our GDP and that's why support trump 100% on bringing the jobs back and closing
[3:36:01.640 --> 3:36:08.040]  the borders on other issues i don't again i'm a political atheist i don't believe in people
[3:36:08.920 --> 3:36:16.920]  or clubs like the dumbo crats or the repulsive kins i look at issues for the way they are
[3:36:16.920 --> 3:36:25.880]  so i agree with them 100% on that don't like a lot of the foreign policy stuff but anyway
[3:36:27.960 --> 3:36:38.920]  that's one of your better jobs machine operator truck drivers 55,000 cashier yeah get a job at
[3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:50.040]  walmart 711 28,000 bucks bank teller 32,000 office manager 48,000
[3:36:52.200 --> 3:37:00.280]  delivery driver 41,000 emergency medical technician 35,000 security officer number
[3:37:00.280 --> 3:37:06.920]  10 35,000 you can't live in new york city on these kind of wages you can't live in a lot of places
[3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:09.080]  so we look at the job numbers
[3:37:12.920 --> 3:37:19.160]  they're okay but the labor force participation rate is very high and they don't count the people
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:25.000]  that are no longer looking for jobs now front page in today's wall street journal
[3:37:25.880 --> 3:37:33.480]  merger to create aerospace giant united technologies raytheon the form company valued at more than
[3:37:33.480 --> 3:37:40.680]  $100 billion again there used to be laws in place that prohibited these mergers and acquisitions
[3:37:40.680 --> 3:37:44.920]  and when i was a young guy there were no hedge funds or private equity groups like the black
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:37:49.640]  stones or the black rocks whoever they are and and buying up all this stuff
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:37:57.000]  it was small businesses and corporations yeah they were the big ones but there was competition
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  this is from my book trends 2000 1996 it was a warner book a bestseller
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:17.000]  and i'm talking about it because of this story about the merger of lockheed excuse me of
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:24.120]  united technologies and raytheon because back then it was another merger layoff payoff
[3:38:24.120 --> 3:38:29.800]  the clinton administration has agreed to use 31 million dollars in taxpayer money
[3:38:30.520 --> 3:38:38.040]  to pay a third of the 92 million dollars in bonuses that top officials of martin marietta corp
[3:38:38.600 --> 3:38:47.240]  and lockheed corp granted themselves to staging the largest merger in pentagon history
[3:38:47.240 --> 3:38:54.440]  the government subsidized merger the government subsidized we paying for this
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:39:07.000]  of lockheed martin marietta which will eliminate 30 000 jobs stockholders argued that the bonuses
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:17.880]  including 8.2 million for marietta chairman norman augustine were excessive and want unwarranted
[3:39:17.880 --> 3:39:24.280]  defense secretary william perry and cia director john deutch had been consultants to martin marietta
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  and was said to maintain close personal relationships with augustine
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:35.080]  all right
[3:39:40.520 --> 3:39:41.800]  nothing changes
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:51.080]  study released friday says pay for chief executives at 23 major corporations rose
[3:39:51.080 --> 3:40:02.440]  30 last year through the time oh though the firms laid off hundreds of thousands of workers
[3:40:02.440 --> 3:40:12.360]  since 1991 that was according to ap so that's what's going on with the job market now the economy
[3:40:12.360 --> 3:40:23.160]  india they cut their interest rates australia cut their interest rates australia's economy
[3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:32.120]  slows to levels not seen since the great financial crisis fed considers july rate cut
[3:40:32.840 --> 3:40:41.080]  after sharp drop in jobs growth how long have i been saying this since march and our trend
[3:40:41.080 --> 3:40:46.760]  alerts and trends journal the federal reserve is going to cut interest rates at least four times
[3:40:46.760 --> 3:40:56.600]  before the 2020 election if not more than then lackluster german exports take toll this is all
[3:40:56.600 --> 3:41:04.520]  the current events forming future trends exports sell five point excuse me three point seven percent
[3:41:04.520 --> 3:41:17.560]  and last month and imports fell 1.3 percent german industrial production fell nearly two percent
[3:41:17.560 --> 3:41:28.840]  in april you're looking for growth in germany at the grand total of 1.2 percent it's a global
[3:41:28.840 --> 3:41:35.320]  slowdown that's why you're seeing gold prices go up because interest rates are going down
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:42.600]  and these digital currencies printed on nothing and backed by nothing are going to be printed more
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:50.760]  but although i say they're going to lower interest rates and aggressively investors
[3:41:50.760 --> 3:41:59.240]  misplacing fed's next move on rates goldman and ubs says they warned that expectations

[3:50:08.120 --> 3:50:16.440]  and should be boycotted moldulva crisis deepens as new president calls snap election again remember
[3:50:16.440 --> 3:50:25.240]  this is like two days after protest in albania president cancels election
[3:50:29.320 --> 3:50:42.040]  yep 500 protesters in kazakhstan election are detained and europe reacts with dismay at prospect
[3:50:42.040 --> 3:50:50.600]  of reckless johnson in number 10 when britain voted to leave the e u frank walter sten mayer germany's
[3:50:50.600 --> 3:50:56.920]  then foreign minister made it clear who he thought was to blame irresponsible politicians
[3:50:56.920 --> 3:51:02.520]  lower the country into brexit and then went off and played cricket
[3:51:02.520 --> 3:51:11.080]  and that was a clear reference to boris johnson the man who was the face of the leave campaign
[3:51:13.640 --> 3:51:17.720]  boris johnson people voted to leave why don't you mind your own business germany
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:26.680]  but anyway you can see what's going on moldovan court orders president or excuse me moldovan
[3:51:26.680 --> 3:51:34.280]  court oust president and appoints replacement adding to instability and i didn't mention what's
[3:51:34.280 --> 3:51:41.960]  going on in somalia how about algeria that's only been going on for 16 weeks and then again what
[3:51:41.960 --> 3:51:48.600]  else is going on over there ah south africa everybody's happy over there oh brazil i forgot
[3:51:48.600 --> 3:51:57.560]  brazil buck back into recession what about argentina i only have a interest rate you want to borrow
[3:51:57.560 --> 3:52:07.240]  some dough it's only about 65 percent pay so down over 50 percent oh mexico yep showing
[3:52:07.240 --> 3:52:18.040]  recessionary numbers you got it it's a global slowdown i'm putting the pieces together here because
[3:52:18.040 --> 3:52:23.080]  two factors right off and many more beneath it number one
[3:52:25.800 --> 3:52:33.160]  top trends for 2019 human waves oh yeah four million left uh venezuela in the last few years
[3:52:33.800 --> 3:52:40.440]  you think you're gonna stay in el salador oh yeah you want to hang around uh hold on uh
[3:52:40.440 --> 3:52:50.200]  uh any of these countries i i i read to you about kazakhstan you want to hang around in uh
[3:52:51.560 --> 3:52:52.040]  Haiti
[3:52:54.760 --> 3:53:03.080]  oh here's a good one and the band rolls on rocker comedian actor and vlogger run for parliament
[3:53:03.080 --> 3:53:10.360]  in ukraine yeah they already elected a comedian and he blew out poroshenko the united states
[3:53:10.360 --> 3:53:16.120]  puppet he got like 76 percent of the vote and then when you look at the democrats and repulsive
[3:53:16.120 --> 3:53:21.320]  gins in this country it's a comic show anyway so it's no different anywhere they just got the
[3:53:21.320 --> 3:53:32.600]  different labels again hong kong protesters one after another albania sudan so number one human
[3:53:32.600 --> 3:53:42.600]  waves remember when qaddafi was in as the head of libya the richest country in africa gave the
[3:53:42.600 --> 3:53:48.760]  people more freedom than any of them and has the sweetest sweet crewed around
[3:53:50.920 --> 3:53:55.320]  wonder why that's not it was their broccoli crop they wanted that's why they went in the america
[3:53:55.320 --> 3:54:01.720]  and the rest he warned europe that you will have a wave of migrants coming out of africa into europe
[3:54:01.720 --> 3:54:06.120]  if you get rid of me and they got rid of them and they've been coming in and haven't stopped
[3:54:08.200 --> 3:54:12.200]  number two is a global slowdown that's why you see this
[3:54:14.520 --> 3:54:22.920]  this is real the jobs i showed you they're not paying money the more cheap labor that comes in
[3:54:22.920 --> 3:54:31.960]  the lower the pay of the jobs supply and demand they're going to lower interest rates and more
[3:54:31.960 --> 3:54:38.840]  quantitative easing around the world you see the chinese yuan going down now
[3:54:41.960 --> 3:54:48.200]  and has nothing to do with them purposely lowering it it's going down because they're pumping more
[3:54:48.200 --> 3:54:56.040]  cheap dough into their economy and trying to prop it up exports were up imports were down in china
[3:54:56.920 --> 3:55:06.840]  imports are very important to them because some 80 percent of their gdp is consumer base here it's
[3:55:06.840 --> 3:55:13.560]  about two thirds so they're not bringing this stuff in so they're printing all this money coming up
[3:55:13.560 --> 3:55:23.160]  with new schemes lowering reserve ratio requirements so the banks could loan out more money i'm reading
[3:55:23.160 --> 3:55:32.280]  all these countries what would i read before about india germany australia there's a global slowdown
[3:55:34.520 --> 3:55:40.840]  so they're going to keep devaluing their currencies my forecast for gold i do not give
[3:55:40.840 --> 3:55:49.080]  financial advice gold has to break over 1385 to gain strength now it's around us we're speaking
[3:55:49.080 --> 3:55:59.720]  about 1330 once it breaks past 1385 it has to hit 1450 per ounce when it breaks that number
[3:55:59.720 --> 3:56:11.960]  and steadies over that for 50 1450 1480 1440 1460 1470 i forecast it's going to spike
[3:56:13.240 --> 3:56:22.120]  $2,000 an ounce all these global economies you heard mario drage the ecb chairman former
[3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:28.040]  goldman sacks guy that ran their european division now head of the european central bank
[3:56:28.040 --> 3:56:32.440]  so last week they're going to use all the tools in the toolbox they can
[3:56:33.320 --> 3:56:44.120]  to prop up the markets toolbox full box bs box that's right a box of garbage a box of worthless
[3:56:44.120 --> 3:56:53.240]  money a box of quantitative easing who made up this crap they didn't teach a quantitative easing zero
[3:56:53.240 --> 3:56:59.400]  negative interest rates like they have now in negative interest rates over there in europe
[3:56:59.960 --> 3:57:07.960]  so their toolbox is running empty and it's only a matter of time before that 250 trillion
[3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:16.920]  dollar debt bubble that's now near 300 trillion and growing is going to explode so again follow
