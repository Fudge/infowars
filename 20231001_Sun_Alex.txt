[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:25.840]  the InfoWar.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.200]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.260]  I am Chase Geyser, filling in for the great Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.560]  So much news to cover tonight, this Sunday night, thank you for tuning in.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.600]  Make sure you visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.300]  Make sure you visit InfoWarsStore.com and be part of the reason why InfoWars is still
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.740]  on the air.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.920]  So much to cover, I don't even know where to start.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.120]  I guess we'll start with this government shutdown fiasco.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.680]  McCarthy days ago, of course, before this temporary resolution passed, said there's no
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.920]  path forward, the Senate stopgap bill is dead on arrival as shutdown approaches.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.680]  And the update as of the 30th was that it looks like the Senate isn't willing to strip
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.400]  Ukraine funds from the continuing resolution.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.520]  In a Friday night tweet, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, said that
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.840]  the misguided Senate bill has no path forward and is dead on arrival.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.420]  He tweeted out, the House will continue to work around the clock to keep government
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.100]  open and prioritize the needs of American people.
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.100]  This of course was due to a conflict of interest between Republicans who are less
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.300]  inclined to fund Ukraine and Democrats who insist that we should.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.760]  Of course, this can't be said for all Republicans because you'll see that we did
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.660]  pass a temporary budgetary bill that seems to support Ukraine.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.780]  But the problem I have with this particular tweet is the emphasis on the importance of
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.980]  keeping government open.
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.160]  I mean, I think this is part of the reason why people are so disenfranchised with McCarthy
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.800]  is that, like many Republicans, he just doesn't seem to understand that we've gotten to
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.360]  a point as conservatives, as patriots, where a government shutdown would be absolutely outstanding.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.300]  I have no problem with the federal government shutting down except for absolutely necessary
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.420]  things like protecting the border, which of course we don't do, protecting private
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.880]  property rights and enforcing contracts, protecting individual rights.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.380]  And he's emphasizing here the importance of keeping the government open.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.260]  This is just immediately sort of alienating to me to look at.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.380]  And you'll see that Biden did sign the CR bill, allowing US government to avoid shutdown
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.900]  late on Saturday.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.820]  The US Congress passed a continuing resolution bill that will keep the government running
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.500]  for the next 45 days.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.740]  I wonder if Biden will be able to run for the next 45 days.
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.940]  He always seems like he's on low battery.
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.700]  The bill was then passed to the president for his signature US President Joe Biden signed
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.920]  a short term spending bill approved by the Congress, which provides continuing funding
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.180]  of government work for a period of 45 days until the 17th of November, the White House
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.900]  said on Sunday.
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.260]  On Saturday, the US cleared the 60 vote threshold needed to pass the short term bill that will
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.740]  continue to fund the government for the next 45 days.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.740]  The funding will include disaster relief funds, an extension of a federal flood insurance
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.660]  program and FAA reauthorization.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.100]  It will not include assistance for Ukraine, as is said in this statement.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.180]  But if we look at what Matt Gates had to say, more deceit, Gates rages over McCarthy
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.220]  Ukraine side deal to pass stopgap.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.780]  Gates says that McCarthy didn't tell House Republicans about the resolution until after
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.540]  the vote had taken place.
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.860]  And he tweets out, wow, Speaker McCarthy made a side Ukraine deal with Democrats and
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.540]  didn't tell House Republicans until after his continuing resolution passed.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.580]  So more shenanigans from the right, more assistance for Ukraine, more betrayal of Americans.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.620]  I would much rather see the government shut down entirely than our tax dollars be spent
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.820]  continuously to fund Nazis in Ukraine at the expense of the American people.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.100]  But that's just not how it goes in Congress.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.100]  Stick with us, folks.

[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:25.620]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show folks.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.660]  I am Chase Geyser filling in for the great Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.420]  It is an honor and a pleasure to be with you this Sunday evening.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.420]  So much news to cover.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.060]  It seems like the Republicans have betrayed America again and will continue to support
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.100]  Ukraine and keep the federal government open.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.300]  But what else is there to expect folks?
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.000]  Of course they want to keep the government open.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.020]  After all they are the government and I have no problem with Republican voters.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.540]  And frankly I don't have many problems with the average Democrat voter though I do see
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.100]  them as very misguided.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.220]  But it's our politicians.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.220]  The actual leadership.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.580]  When I talk about leftists I'm talking about leftists in power and that includes most Republicans
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.280]  in power.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.560]  To me leftism is anything that seeks to expand the government and minimize the rights
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.320]  of individual people and it is a virus that has taken hold in this country far worse
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.920]  than COVID ever did.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.960]  We see now that Biden is demanding uninterrupted cash flow to Ukraine.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.600]  President Joe Biden has welcomed a bipartisan short term budget deal that will keep the
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.640]  US government open for the next 45 days but was disappointed that none of the billions
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.240]  of dollars in aid to Kiev that he had requested made it into the final bill.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.600]  Though we do have Matt Gaetz sort of accusing McCarthy of making a Ukraine side deal, we
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.200]  cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted Biden
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.000]  said in a brief statement on Saturday night shortly after Congress passed the measure.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.720]  Let's go ahead and run clip 11 so we can see exactly what the left complains about
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:12.040]  in terms of our national budget versus what they're demanding here in their uninterrupted
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.080]  cash flow for our foreign so-called allies.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:26.440]  Their bill includes devastating 30% cuts, you heard me, 30% cuts and listen to what
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440]  that means.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:44.000]  So they're incredibly disappointed at cuts to our own federal government and happy to
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.040]  spend all sorts of money on Ukraine anywhere they can.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.820]  Maybe they could work out some sort of a deal where if we stop supporting foreign
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.960]  so-called allies, we could afford to keep employees in the federal government though
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:04.120]  I have no problem with cuts being made to the ATF or to the IRS because frankly I think
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.000]  that the ATF is totally unnecessary and the IRS is theft.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]  I even question whether or not income tax is constitutional.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.800]  I know that we passed a constitutional amendment to allow it but I think it's very
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.080]  questionable as to whether or not that was a legitimate effort that was made and to me
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.580]  just on principle I think that the concept of income tax is totally abhorrent to all
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.900]  of the principles in which this country was founded on.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:33.020]  A new exclusive report that a UK journalist was arrested for reporting on Ukrainian Nazis
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.220]  visit to parliament in Canada tells all.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.140]  I know Owen covered this fairly extensively last week.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:47.260]  Of course we had the Canadian parliament give two standing ovations for an actual formally
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.580]  enlisted Nazi.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.380]  Of course the house speaker, I believe the parliament speaker of Canada, resigned over
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:10:00.100]  this oversight and Trudeau was not reluctant at all to blame others, everyone basically
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:06.140]  except for himself for it but they actually arrested a journalist in the UK for calling
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:12.500]  out what happened and then they impeached, or excuse me, they forced the house speaker
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.100]  to resign over actually doing what was reported.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.460]  So freedom of speech is totally under attack.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:24.620]  Meanwhile we've got Russia and North Korea seemingly getting closer and closer which is
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.220]  scary because North Korea is basically an extension of China so any friendliness between
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.180]  North Korea and Russia is an indicator of friendliness between China and Russia.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.380]  Of course China seems to be positioning itself to invade Taiwan.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:52.940]  Check out clip 10 of Kim Jong Un visiting Russia.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:58.360]  You can see he's visiting an air hanger and doing his typical Kim Jong Un thing where
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.100]  he looks around as if he's an expert in everything and people explain different
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:09.020]  technologies to him and he appears to be making suggestions or commenting on different details
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:15.620]  but the fact that they've had this reciprocity between Russia and North Korea is very alarming
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:21.100]  especially given that China and Russia seem to be more and more buddy-buddy since the
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.140]  onset of the Ukrainian war.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.100]  There he is meeting Putin.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.100]  Looks like he's lost weight.
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.660]  Oh no, never mind, just good lighting.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.300]  You can see they're exploring the hanger.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.860]  Putin's looking very KGB and that was reported by the Wall Street Journal.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.940]  World War III military draft could be imminent.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.300]  Are we about to be conscripted to fight Russia?
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.440]  Josh Sigurdson reports on recent findings in the updated edition of the US Army War
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.340]  College's academic journal.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:12:01.420]  One of the disturbing pieces in the section titled quote casualties replacements and reconstitutions
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:08.380]  end quote says large-scale combat operations troop requirements may well require a reconceptualization
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:15.340]  of the 1970s and 1980s volunteer force in the move toward partial conscription.
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:21.140]  So now we have our own military in writing suggesting that we prepare for at least partial
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.060]  conscription and we know that partial conscription typically leads to mass conscription
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:30.300]  if not universal conscription and so it seems like the US military is legitimately
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.540]  concerned about World War III.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.780]  I don't know that the military itself is pushing for World War III but it wouldn't
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.820]  surprise me given that the military industrial complex does stand to make billions upon
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:47.420]  billions if not trillions of dollars if World War III actually takes place.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:53.180]  If the military is even considering mandatory conscription then they indeed will enforce
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.920]  it later as is written here.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.780]  Not since the Vietnam War have we seen conscription and the only way such conscription
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.660]  would happen is versus Russia while it's unlikely to see an actual ground war with
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.020]  China as a naval war is more likely China will most definitely back Russia in such
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.760]  a large-scale war Russia has far more nuclear weapons than the United States the
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.660]  proxy war we are seeing happen today between Russia Ukraine and China Taiwan are completely
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:26.700]  scripted events leading us into the great reset order out of chaos is the goal globalists
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:36.320]  need an excuse to reset the currency and the culture and world order in general.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.020]  More reporting on this from RT Western idiots want World War III says ex-Russian president
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.900]  the conflict in Ukraine may lead to World War III because of the idiots occupying leading
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:51.580]  roles in the West former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned and frankly I
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.980]  think he's right frankly I think that the United States is responsible for everything
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.980]  that happened in the Cold War.
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.740]  I believe that what happened was we came out of World War II we'd established these
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:06.580]  major military contractors we'd established this military industrial complex and after
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.860]  we came out of World War II all of the demand for those contractors those businesses
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:16.600]  those individuals just evaporated because we're no longer any World War and so what
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.860]  did they do in order to make sure that demand stayed in place well they established
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.340]  a Cold War and said hey if we don't continue to build up our arms as if World War II is
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:32.300]  still going on then communism will spread everywhere and Russia will nuke us and so
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:39.740]  for decades we expanded our military power we expanded our nuclear arsenal and we perpetuated
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.160]  this Cold War even though there probably wasn't even a real threat we saw the same
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.620]  thing happen after World War II with agriculture all of a sudden we started putting high
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:54.420]  fructose corn syrup in all of our food because all of the demand for our agriculture to ship
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.260]  overseas to supply our soldiers had suddenly evaporated and so what else were we gonna
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.620]  do with all the corn that we were producing all this turned into sugar and put high fructose
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.260]  corn syrup instead of pure cane sugar and everything and that's why our whole entire
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.620]  country is fat and it's the same exact thing that happened with the military industrial
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.740]  complex happened with the agricultural industrial complex for lack of a better expression and
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:20.140]  so yeah I wouldn't doubt it one bit one bit if the military industrial complex actually
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.420]  wants World War III to happen the upside to World War III happening is we would actually
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:30.380]  see a draining of the swamp I mean if Washington D.C. got nuked maybe it would
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.860]  solve a lot of our problems that's basically the main reason why I think we'll never
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.860]  enter nuclear war is because why would our enemies ever do us a favor and wipe out
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.620]  everybody in Washington D.C. who's responsible for all the corruption and evil and injustice
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.540]  that's happening to our own people we'll cover more of this in the next segment make

[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:31.379]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I am chase geyser filling in for the great Alex Jones
[00:20:31.379 --> 00:20:36.139]  again it's an honor and a pleasure to be with you covering the falling apart the
[00:20:36.139 --> 00:20:41.300]  entropy of America under the Biden regime has more bin Laden calls it the regime
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.220]  and is not an administration it is a regime it is embodied by corruption it
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:51.420]  is the very embodiment of corruption itself I want to show you a series of
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.780]  clips just to give you a sense of how things are going in America was run
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:07.139]  you see that fist bump border patrol just giving a fist bump as people cross here's
[00:21:07.139 --> 00:21:09.580]  Philly Apple Store probably saw this on Twitter
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:23.220]  they do the same thing with ballot
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:36.980]  here's a harbor in Newport and lived in right outside of Newport
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.500]  bunch of teenagers looks like they hijacked some school buses
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:50.700]  they're just doing donuts in the in the harbor unbelievable
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.660]  miss Gen Z can drive stick
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:22.380]  and then transgender student just beats the living hell out of another student
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:29.620]  this is the chaos under the Biden administration no justice no order
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:38.900]  no respect or communities or rights of individuals just totally totally torn
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.980]  apart meanwhile close the effing border set an island residents display
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:49.540]  banner over highway there's more on this but I want to pop over to clip
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.180]  nine which is a video showing Biden's Border Patrol again cuts barbed wire to
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:23:00.060]  help illegals enter the US but nine Eagle Pass Texas were just moments ago
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:05.780]  customs and border protection cut a hole through the concertina wire that has
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.820]  been stretched by Texas DPS along the border there to allow migrants to come
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.740]  through it was initially a group of about 60 to 70 people it swelled to
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:20.139]  some 300 very very quickly some women and children who were sort of in the
[00:23:20.139 --> 00:23:25.380]  middle of the river were picked up by I guess it would be Texas DPS because
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.060]  they're running the airboats there up and down the river and taken out of
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:33.260]  the water and to safer ground there but as you can see as we have watched
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.540]  for the last couple of weeks the illegal migration on involves the
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:43.780]  United States continues with this border crossing in Eagle Pass seeing thousands
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.220]  of people and then over the weekend we set what we believe is a new record
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:52.420]  of 11,000 people crossing into the United States in a single day we'll keep
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.500]  an eye on this for you in the meantime you know I was somebody who
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.980]  didn't really care about the border until the last couple of years and you
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:06.420]  know I've always been pro borders and pro legal immigration and I just kind of
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:11.020]  grew up in a community that was conservative but thought hey you know
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.500]  these people kind of creeping in these people leaking into our country really
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.300]  they're just trying to work hard at jobs that we don't want to do and send
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.980]  money back to their families that was kind of what my thinking was but now
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.940]  that we have like the equivalent of the state of Wyoming coming in every
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.820]  month this is a full-scale invasion how can you claim that we have a
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.340]  country if we're just cutting the barbed wire and allowing people in I mean
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.620]  Trump worked so hard to build the wall raise so much money to build the
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.620]  wall but built much of it hundreds of miles of it repaired hundreds of miles
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.740]  of it and now it doesn't even matter whether or not there's a law because we
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.020]  have an administration that doesn't enforce the wall the wall at all it
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.300]  doesn't matter if we have a wall because the administration won't enforce
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.659]  the laws if we're just gonna cut the barbed wire if we're gonna cut the
[00:24:55.659 --> 00:25:00.100]  fencing then what's the point of even having a border at all or a wall at
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.380]  all this is why it's so important that we have the right administration in
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.180]  place frankly what's alarming to me most about this is that we've allowed the
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:15.500]  executive branch of this country to become so powerful that the differences
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:22.139]  in policy swayed so drastically depending on who's in office like if there's a
[00:25:22.139 --> 00:25:25.060]  major leftist in office they shouldn't have the power to do this just like if
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.860]  there's a major right-winger in office they shouldn't have a power by
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.460]  executive authority to do a bunch of stuff that I agree with the executive
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.820]  branch is way overpowered when we can just totally neglect the Constitution
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.820]  of the United States the fact that we have a country the fact that we have
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:45.780]  immigration laws if we can totally neglect it then do we even have a
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.220]  Constitution anymore to me when you're cutting the barbed wire and just
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:53.100]  letting people into our country it's a metaphor for what Pelosi did to the
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.139]  State of the Union address as if she was doing the same the very same thing
[00:25:57.139 --> 00:26:00.139]  to the Constitution in the United States you might as well just rip it in
[00:26:00.139 --> 00:26:03.820]  half let's go ahead and play clip 16 while we have time just so that we
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:08.620]  can show what's happening in Sweden because they've let too many migrants in
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:13.260]  remember back in 2017 when Trump said this about Sweden you look at what's
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:18.820]  happening in Germany you look at what's happening last night in Sweden
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:25.540]  Sweden who would believe this Sweden they took in large numbers they're
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.460]  having problems like they never thought possible he was talking generally about
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:34.020]  soaring crime and terror attacks attributable to mass migration and open
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:39.180]  borders but then the media including primarily the BBC mocked him for talking
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:43.460]  about something that supposedly didn't exist Sweden to Trump what happened
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.300]  last night Trump tries to explain remark about Sweden amid confusion they
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.060]  also mocked your boy here for saying similar stuff well they're not mocking
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:56.260]  us now is the BBC reporting today about how rampant gang violence has forced
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:00.020]  the Swedish Prime Minister to call on the army to perform law enforcement
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:04.380]  olf kristensen addressed the nation last night during a televised speech
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.620]  announcing that emergency talks will take place today with the commander in
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.580]  chief of the Swedish Armed Forces now more and more children and completely
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.740]  innocent people are affected by the gross violence he said I cannot
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.220]  emphasize enough how serious the situation is Sweden has never seen
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.940]  anything like this before no other country in Europe has seen anything like
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:27.980]  this kristensen blamed the quote unsuccessful integration of the millions
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.780]  of migrants who have poured into the country as one of the primary reasons
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.980]  behind the chaos this after the former leftist Prime Minister Magdalena
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.740]  Anderson acknowledged that mass migration had led to violent parallel
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:44.180]  societies in just 12 hours two men were shot dead in Stockholm and a 25
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.060]  year old woman was killed in a blast at her own home 12 people have been
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:52.260]  killed in gang violence so far this month alone grenade attacks and riots
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.580]  have become commonplace not to mention the soaring rates of non-violent crimes
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.100]  Sweden went from being one of the safest countries in Europe to the
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.420]  second most dangerous gee I wonder what changed no one's laughing now are
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.540]  they I guess Trump was right all along but according to the spokesperson
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.940]  of a group linked to Amnesty International the real root of the
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.860]  problem isn't being addressed and that's that there aren't enough youth
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.880]  clubs and sports centers for young people wow they've really identified the
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.000]  true cause of runaway gang violence and ethnic riot so just don't enough table

[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:07.420]  messively myself everybody's being very excited about the impeachment Joe
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.300]  Biden but remember he is a totally complete puppet it needs to be about
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:15.620]  the criminals that control him the CIA Black Rock the multinational
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.980]  corporations you want to blame Obama yeah he's above by but he's still a
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.980]  puppet too we need to make it about the power structure that's waging war
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.060]  against this country of those two industrializing us attacking our
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.780]  culture and creating race war we need to make the impeachment all about the
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.620]  open borders and the human trafficking and the global government of the UN
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.780]  taking control of our medical system that's what we need to do that's
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.900]  we've got a stand for that's what he's going to bring down the system it'll be
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.580]  just thinking about like just about how horrible he is nice a pedophile and
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:54.740]  our sons a crackhead and gun charges it becomes a distraction from the larger
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:01.300]  issues we'll cover it all live at info wars comm board slash show leading a
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:08.460]  frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:38.470]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show I am Chase Geyser filling in for Alex Jones so much news to cover
[00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:51.470]  it's the same story you know I've been listening to a lot of the broadcasts way back to 2001 just for fun I throw them on I like to listen to on this day 20 years ago
[00:33:51.470 --> 00:34:03.470]  just try to see what Alex said and it's the same story and he's been talking about the New World Order for over 20 years and all we're seeing are different variables in the same formula
[00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:16.470]  they're expanding power they're trying to conglomerate power and they're trying to mitigate individual rights because international leaders have incentive to protect each other against their own constituents against their people
[00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:28.470]  they come together at these meetings in Davos or wherever they meet and they conspire to keep each other in power in exchange for favors
[00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:46.470]  in exchange for expanding that power as an effort to mitigate any sort of constituent basis any sort of people of any individual leader they want to make sure that no people has the power to overthrow the status quo
[00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:51.470]  Biden labels the entire MAGA base extremist let's run clip one and then talk about that
[00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:44.470]  my friends, they're not hiding their attacks they're openly promoting them attacking the free press as the enemy of the people attacking the rule of law as an impediment formatting voter suppression and election subversion
[00:35:44.470 --> 00:36:02.470]  did you ever think we'd be having debates in your stage of your careers were banning books banning books and burying history extremists in Congress more determined to shut down the government to burn the place down than to let the business be done
[00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:16.470]  our US military and this is not hyperbole I've said it for the last two years is the strongest military in the history of the world not just the strongest in the world in the history of the world
[00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:38.470]  the most diverse the most powerful in the history of the world and it's being accused of being weak and woke by the opposition one guy in Alabama is holding up the promotion of every hundreds of these officers
[00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:52.470]  frankly these extremists have no idea what the hell they're talking about I'm serious they're pushing a notion the defeated former president expressed when he was in office and believed supplies only to him
[00:36:52.470 --> 00:37:00.470]  and this is a dangerous notion this president is above the law no limits on power
[00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:12.470]  Trump says the Constitution gave him quote the right to do whatever he wants as president end of quote I've never heard a president say that in general
[00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:26.470]  he says that we're attacking the free press because we call the press the enemy of the people when we know that the press has been systematically compromised by the intelligence community since the red scare
[00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:42.470]  so there is no free press anymore folks if we've learned anything from Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter and the Twitter leaks the Twitter files if we've learned anything we know that there is no free press in the United States of America
[00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:53.470]  when you see network after network after network say the same thing over and over again at the same time on the same days from a central source
[00:37:54.470 --> 00:38:07.470]  you can't say that there's a freedom of the press the right does not attack free press the right attacks a deep state press it attacks a political press not a private press
[00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:13.470]  and how could he claim to be the advocate for the first amendment right of freedom of press
[00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:24.470]  after we know that the Biden administration has systematically done everything it possibly can to censor free speech in this country because freedom of the press is just an extension of free speech
[00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:33.470]  they're basically the same thing they just wanted to explicitly state freedom of the press as well as freedom of speech it doesn't just apply to individuals it applies to journalists and organizations as well
[00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:42.470]  it's the same right so he's saying that we're attacking the freedom of the press when we know that they're coming into these major big tech companies and asking for specific censorship of specific voices
[00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:50.470]  but where are the enemies of the people where are the ones that are extremists when his administration is literally getting hammered for bullying
[00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:56.470]  platforms into silencing individual Americans
[00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:07.470]  he's saying that we want to ban books we don't want to ban books we just don't want porn to be purchased with our taxes and placed in public school systems
[00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:15.470]  no one's saying that genderqueer can't be published or that individuals can't purchase that book if they want to off of Amazon or Barnes and Noble
[00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:21.470]  we're just saying we don't want it in our public school libraries but you're calling us book burners
[00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:34.470]  just last week I covered on the American Journal the press is saying that we're dog whistling to right wing extremists because we have a six month plan in 2025
[00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:43.470]  and they're saying six months is how long it took for the Nazis to take over Germany so by having a six month plan instead of a hundred day plan that's a dog whistle to right wing extremists
[00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:50.470]  and now they're calling us book burners like the Nazis against the freedom of the press like the Nazis and extremists like the Nazis
[00:39:50.470 --> 00:40:01.470]  they're trying to frame us as Nazis while they steal our money and fund it to literal Nazis and give standing ovations to formerly enlisted Nazis
[00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:11.470]  I'm not just using hyperbole here when they're giving standing ovations to formerly enlisted Nazis it doesn't get any more pro Nazi than that
[00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:18.470]  it's the same exact thing let's go ahead and run clip 17 to see what I mean
[00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:27.470]  what about what Elon Musk has done to Twitter lowering guardrails against misinformation does that contribute to it?
[00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:35.470]  yeah it does look one of the things that I said to you when I thought I wasn't going to run I was going to write a book about the changes taking place
[00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:47.470]  and most of it's directed over the years for these fundamental changes in society by changing technology Gutenberg in the printing press changed the way Europeans could talk to one another
[00:40:47.470 --> 00:41:03.470]  all the way to today where do people get their news they go on the internet they go online they go and you have no notion whether it's true or not
[00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:18.470]  so he's saying that we're against freedom of the press while he complains about freedom of speech on X claiming that Elon Musk's X has made it so Americans have no notion whether news is true or not
[00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:26.470]  Joe Biden claimed Elon Musk's purchase of X formerly Twitter has made it so Americans have no notion of whether news is true or not or what news is true or not
[00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:37.470]  in a pro public interview on Sunday Biden claimed Musk's X platform is contributing to rise in misinformation which basically is a dog whistle for we need to censor more
[00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:50.470]  what about what Elon Musk has done to Twitter lowering the guardrails against misinformation does that contribute to it the host John Harwood asked and Biden blamed Elon Musk for misinformation
[00:41:50.470 --> 00:42:02.470]  meanwhile the Lincoln project founder is roasted for claiming that January 6 was worse than 9-11 during a podcast they're doing everything they can to try to label you as an extremist that's what's going on here folks
[00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:10.470]  they're trying to do everything they can to say that you are a domestic terrorist you are an extremist because if you're classified as a domestic terrorist you don't have the same rights as an American citizen
[00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:17.470]  and they want to come after you they want to persecute you they want to tax you they want to audit you they want to silence you they want to bully you they want to harass you
[00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:25.470]  they want to strip your friends and family from you they want to divide America against you because we're the extremists

[00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:16.910]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:22.910]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I am Chase Geyser filling in for the great Alex Jones.
[00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:34.910]  Make sure you visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link because while other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:45.910]  In new news, Jack Smith demands a gag order for Trump proclaiming General Milley should be executed for treason.
[00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:53.910]  I believe Twitter used this excuse to censor several people after the most recent quote election.
[00:47:53.910 --> 00:48:04.910]  And frankly I think that you should be able to say that somebody should be executed for treason because it comes with the implication that there would of course be a trial
[00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:09.910]  and there would be a jury of the accused peers
[00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:16.910]  and only if found guilty would that execution occur. And frankly, I agree with Trump.
[00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:28.910]  I think that Biden and Milley and many others within the Biden regime should be charged formally with treason.
[00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:34.910]  They should be given the opportunity to defend themselves.
[00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:42.910]  A jury of their peers should render a verdict and when found guilty, they should be hanged.
[00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:51.910]  Special Counsel Jack Smith submitted a new court filing demanding a gag order for former President Donald Trump citing his disparaging remarks against the judge in his case,
[00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:57.910]  Judge Tonya Chutkin, as well as outgoing Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Mark Milley.
[00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:07.910]  Because they're doing everything they can, they're using any excuse they possibly can to censor the former president because they are concerned that he is going to win the election in 2024
[00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:17.910]  and by God wouldn't that be a travesty if that element of democracy, that democratic element of our constitutional republic be allowed to take place.
[00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:20.910]  They seem to love democracy so much, they want to protect democracy so much.
[00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:27.910]  We saw a clip in the last segment of Biden talking about the importance of the freedom of the press so much, the importance of not book burning so much,
[00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:35.910]  yet they want to make sure that a candidate for president, the most popular candidate for president, president mind you, is not allowed to be on the ballot,
[00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:42.910]  let alone speak during this election process because God forbid that most people would actually vote for him.
[00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:46.910]  Smith two weeks ago filed a motion for a limited gag order against Trump,
[00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:52.910]  but on Friday Smith submitted a new motion in response to recent criticisms the former president made against Milley,
[00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:58.910]  Chutkin, former Vice President Mike Pence, and former Attorney General Bill Barr.
[00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:03.910]  And I spoke with Tony Shafer, man, a couple of years ago when I first started my podcast,
[00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:07.910]  there was a clip somewhere we might be able to dig it up before the end of the show today,
[00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:15.910]  Tony Shafer told me that Bill Barr called him and just straight up asked him to stop, stop investigating election fraud right after the election.
[00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:21.910]  Donald Trump, meanwhile, slamming a lawless leftist at California GOP convention, of course,
[00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:28.910]  he mimics Biden 80, getting lost on stage and claims Gavin Newsom is plotting a 2024 run because,
[00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:37.910]  why not? I still think it's going to be Michelle Obama, I'm with Ted Cruz on this.
[00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:44.910]  Meanwhile, is Google rigging the 2024 election the controversy over invisible Republicans?
[00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:53.910]  A new report from the right leaning media research center concludes that Google is burying search results for 2024 presidential candidates,
[00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:58.910]  but an expert in search engine optimization has suggested it's unlikely.
[00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:05.910]  Please just go on Google right now and type in American inventors or famous inventors.
[00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:07.910]  I'd be interested if the crew would do this, too.
[00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:11.910]  I want to see what pops up because if you're telling me and they could have changed it since I last did this,
[00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:14.910]  I did this a couple of years ago, so maybe they fixed it since then.
[00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:21.910]  But if you're telling me that Google is not manipulating search results, then you probably lost your mind.
[00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:25.910]  According to various tests conducted by MRC and Just the News,
[00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:30.910]  the online visibility of these sites in generic searches for the GOP's 2024 bench is practically nil
[00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:36.910]  and not significantly better for RFK Jr., Biden's primary challenge on the left.
[00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:40.910]  Oh, they fixed it. They fixed it.
[00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:46.910]  A couple of years ago, the only results that would come up for American inventors were people of color,
[00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:48.910]  and it looks like they largely corrected it.
[00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:50.910]  Well, good for them, fixing that problem.
[00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:55.910]  But they were definitely experimenting with manipulating those search results specifically,
[00:51:55.910 --> 00:52:02.910]  but we know that if you want to look up any information regarding COVID-19 or vaccine safety and efficacy,
[00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:10.910]  we know that all of the search results are filtered to only show the state mandated narratives results.
[00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:15.910]  We know that if you want to search Alex Jones or Infowars on Google search results,
[00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:22.910]  you're only going to see negative press and you're not going to see any Infowars articles actually turn up in the search results
[00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:27.910]  because as a fake news media site, we are being censored.
[00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:37.910]  We know that Google shut down Tulsi Gabbard's ad campaign during the Democratic primary in the last cycle,
[00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:42.910]  right after a tremendous performance in a debate where she practically ran over Kamala Harris
[00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:47.910]  in maybe the most embarrassing performance of anyone in the history of Democratic primary debates.
[00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:51.910]  And as soon as that happened, they shut down her ability to run ads.
[00:52:51.910 --> 00:53:00.910]  She had to sue in order to get that resolved, but by then, of course, it's too late regardless of the outcome of any lawsuit.
[00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:05.910]  Trump vows to hold Silicon Valley tech giants accountable for censorship.
[00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:09.910]  I wish that he would have done this in his last term because in large,
[00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:14.910]  I think the censorship is the reason that the state got away with so much that it did.
[00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:22.910]  I mean, during the entire pandemic, you couldn't claim that the virus came from a lab because that was considered racist.
[00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.910]  Now we know that the virus did, in fact, come from a lab.
[00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:28.910]  At least that's by far the most likely explanation that the virus came from the lab.
[00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:35.910]  You couldn't say any criticisms of any of the vaccines, particularly the mRNA vaccines on any of the platforms.
[00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:40.910]  And we know now that they're causing all sorts of health problems, including myocarditis.
[00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:46.910]  And we know now that the vaccines were not 100% effective like they said they were.
[00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:51.910]  We know that they didn't stop the spread of the virus like they said they would.
[00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:58.910]  But for saying that on social media during his last term, you would totally lose your account.
[00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:06.910]  Meanwhile, IRS contractors are leaking tax info of rich Americans, including Donald Trump, the DOJ reveals.
[00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:13.910]  A U.S. Internal Revenue Service consultant has been indicted for allegedly stealing and leaking the tax returns of wealthy Americans,
[00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:18.910]  reportedly including then-President Donald Trump to media outlets.
[00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:23.910]  I wouldn't be surprised if he was put up to it by the government, by the deep state itself.
[00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:31.910]  This is what I was talking about when I was covering how Joe Biden is classifying right-wingers or mega-republicans as extremists or domestic terrorists.
[00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:35.910]  This is the type of harassment that we are going to be faced with.
[00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:40.910]  This harassment from the IRS targeting specifically right-wing individuals.
[00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:45.910]  And they always start with the influencers, they always start with the Donald Trumps or the Alex Joneses,
[00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:49.910]  but it won't be long before they come for you.
[00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:52.910]  Obviously, they've come for us here at Infowars quite a bit.
[00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:59.910]  We know that Owen is facing a couple of months in prison for speaking his mind at the Capitol.
[00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:03.910]  And it's just going to work its way down from influencer to individual.
[00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:08.910]  Meanwhile, Bill Maher calls for Biden to drop out of the 2024 race.
[00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:13.910]  And he says, saying that he looks like his own skeletal remains.
[00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.910]  I don't agree with Bill Maher.
[00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:17.910]  Bill Maher, excuse me, more Bill Maher.
[00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:19.910]  I don't agree with Bill Maher most of the time.
[00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:22.910]  But at least he's willing to talk out against the left.
[00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:30.910]  At least he's an example of somebody that's of the left that is a Democrat that speaks some sense to the establishment left.
[00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:33.910]  And it's absolutely true that Joe Biden should back out.
[00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:37.910]  But frankly, I think that the Democratic Party itself wants Biden to back out.
[00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:42.910]  I think they know that it's a long shot for Biden to be able to win against Trump in 2024.
[00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:46.910]  After all, it was a long shot to even say that he won in 2020.
[00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:50.910]  And I think they want to put someone else, anyone else in.
[00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:56.910]  It's so funny to me, too, because if they were to run RFK Jr., I think they would win.
[00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:59.910]  I'm a Trump supporter. I love Donald Trump.
[00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:07.910]  But I think if they ran RFK against Trump, that they would have a really, really good shot at winning.
[00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:13.910]  There's the Tony Schaefer clip on the screen there showing where he told me that Bill Maher tried to shut him down.
[00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:15.910]  Is that clip actually embedded in that article?
[00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:19.910]  Okay, deleted off of Twitter.
[00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:21.910]  Unbelievable.
[00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:23.910]  I know Citizen Free Press covered it at one point in time.
[00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:24.910]  That's so funny.
[00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:25.910]  Oh my God.
[00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:29.910]  Okay, so Bill Maher speaks the truth to the left.
[00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:31.910]  I think the left should run RFK Jr. if they know what's good for him.
[00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:34.910]  But they don't want to run him because he, like Trump, won't play ball.
[00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:36.910]  I don't agree with him as much as I agree with Trump.
[00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:41.910]  But he's similar to Trump in the fact that he is an outsider, despite the fact that his last name is Kennedy.
[00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:43.910]  And he won't play ball with the establishment.
[00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:44.910]  He speaks his mind.
[00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:45.910]  He has his own opinions.
[00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:47.910]  He has his own views.
[00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:53.910]  And they only want people they can control, which is why Joe Biden was the perfect candidate for them,
[00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:56.910]  because having dementia and being basically Weekend at Bernie's,
[00:56:56.910 --> 00:57:02.910]  he is the most malleable president in the history of presidents since Franklin Pierce,
[00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:07.910]  who basically couldn't get anything done because his family tragically died right before he was inaugurated,
[00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:10.910]  and he was distraught during his entire presidency.
[00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:11.910]  Handsome fellow, though.
[00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:13.910]  Anyway, we'll cover more of this in the next segment.
[00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:14.910]  Make sure you stick with us.

[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:53.300]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high-quality
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:57.960]  coffee has not been available, and that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans

[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:18.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, I am Chase Geyser filling in for the great Alex
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.520]  Jones.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:27.620]  As we stand all along the watchtower keeping an eye out for the globalists, I want to show
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:28.980]  you guys a series of fun clips.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:34.380]  I actually saw this clip for the first time today, Elon Musk channels Alex Jones and John
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:40.020]  McAfee fires a .50 caliber rifle from hip at Texas Ranch.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:18.660]  I like these .50s, my type of gun.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:22.700]  John you just got done shooting the .50 over there, we are going to put that on the TV
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:29.620]  show next week, but right now you have got that .223 M4 Scorpion, are you ready to try
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.620]  it out?
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.620]  I don't even know what is here compared to the .50 caliber, this feels like a feather.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:38.700]  That's right, you just hand held and shot the heavy .50 over there.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:43.740]  So this is a piece of cake, these are one of my favorite guns, the AR-15 or its equivalent.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:02:00.180]  Yep, M4, alright buddy we will let her rip.
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.180]  Check this one out.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:06.740]  God I love McAfee, I didn't know he was a lefty, it makes sense, a lot of creative
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:18.620]  people are.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:33.660]  There is a siren right here though.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:39.060]  Slow motion of Elon Musk there firing a .50 from the hip at a Texas Ranch.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:44.140]  It's hard not to like him guys, hard not to like him, can you imagine any elected
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:56.940]  leftists posting a video of this?
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.940]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:01.260]  You know there is a great book you guys should check out called No Domain by Mark
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:07.500]  Eglinton who interviewed for hours upon hours McAfee shortly before his death, I highly
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.500]  recommend that you guys check that out.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.980]  These republicans called for a democrat who pulled fire alarm during crucial shutdown
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:21.420]  vote to be expelled and prosecuted like a January 6th rioter.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:26.040]  Roger Taylor Greene spoke on this extensively but New York representative Jamal Bowman was
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.460]  allegedly caught on camera pulling the alarm in the Cannon building which houses numerous
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:35.100]  congressional office spaces as lawmakers scramble to pass a plan to keep the government funded
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.680]  before it ran out of money on Saturday at midnight.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.360]  You guys can check out the clip of that at band.video.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.520]  He released a statement in which he claimed that the door marked emergency exit is one
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:52.320]  he usually takes to get to votes and says that he thought pushing the big red
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.680]  box that said fire would open it so he seems to be making up an excuse, making
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.960]  up basically a lie in order to justify his behavior there and it's probably going
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.200]  to work because it seems like when politicians lie they usually get away with it these
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200]  days.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.200]  We're going to cut to break.

[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:20.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:27.000]  I am Chase Geyser filling in for Alex himself.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:34.460]  More COVID news coming in with a really sort of embarrassing attempt to try to make
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.460]  the vaccine look cool.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:39.280]  Let's just go straight into clip eight of Mr. T getting the updated COVID-19 shot.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:47.020]  Hey everybody, this is Mr. T. I'm about to get my COVID vaccine booster shot.
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:51.400]  I'm in my sketches, yes, I do everything in sketches, yes.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.320]  I get healthy in sketches, you heard me.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:07:18.760]  Get your vaccination booster.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:23.560]  I hope this doesn't happen, but how crazy would it be if he just died in 30 days?
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:28.680]  Dr. Scott Atlas, politicians and doctors still pushing COVID-19 vaccines are a complete
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.000]  disgrace.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.640]  Former White House coronavirus response advisor, Dr. Scott Atlas, blasted doctors
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.880]  and politicians who are still shilling for the experimental COVID vaccines and boosters,
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.240]  calling them a complete disgrace.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:49.480]  And let's run clip 12 of Biden talking about divergence of opinions.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:53.800]  One of the things that I also, it doesn't directly relate today, but Arthur and I talked
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:08:01.920]  a little bit about it earlier this morning, is that what leaders say matter in terms
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.520]  of people's confidence in things they're not sure about.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:14.200]  And one of those areas, you saw what happened with regard to the crisis, health crisis we
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:18.360]  had that cost us, lost well over a million people.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.960]  And as time began to move on and more and more voices saying, no, no, no, you don't
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.200]  need to get that shot.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.840]  You don't need to be, you don't need to.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:34.120]  And we have a new strain of COVID now and we have answers for it.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:40.760]  But I just would urge those in public life and both political parties and no political
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:50.820]  party to be cautious about sometimes inflammatory things you say about this because people's
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.640]  lives are at stake.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:58.160]  And the last piece was when I was vice president for a slightly different reason, I spent a
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:03.960]  lot of time going between rural areas and urban areas.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:10.040]  Dr. Scott Atlas goes on to say, I don't know if we've elected the dumbest people
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.280]  in the country to be in charge or what's happening here, but we have a country that
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.280]  now recommends a booster for everyone over six months of age, an experimental drug for
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:24.080]  a virus, particularly children have no serious risk from who are healthy, Dr. Atlas told
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.120]  San Diego's KUSI news on Thursday.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.600]  Meanwhile, the globalists on the other side of things seem to leak a little bit of a
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:38.520]  confession that the water crisis will succeed in establishing world government where COVID
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.200]  and climate change failed.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.860]  Let's run clip 13.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.860]  That's also, of course, true with COVID, right?
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:49.940]  We are all only as healthy as our neighbors on our street and our city and our region
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.300]  and our nation and globally.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.420]  Did we solve that?
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.200]  Did we actually manage to vaccinate everyone in the world?
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.200]  No.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.440]  So highlighting water as a global commons and what it means to work together and see it
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.920]  both out of that kind of global commons perspective, but also the self-interest perspective
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.880]  because it does have that parallel, it's not only important, but it's also important
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:14.940]  because we haven't managed to solve those problems, which had similar attributes and
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.600]  water is something that people understand.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.880]  Climate change is a bit abstract.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.680]  Some people understand it really well, some understand it a bit, some just don't understand
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.680]  it.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:26.240]  Water, every kid knows how important it is to have water.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.000]  When you're playing football and you're thirsty, you need water.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.700]  So there's also something about really getting citizen engagement around this and really
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.620]  in some ways experimenting with this notion of the common good.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:41.340]  Can we actually deliver this time in ways that we have failed miserably other times
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:47.140]  and hopefully we won't keep failing on the other things, but anyway.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:51.760]  The interesting thing about that to me is if you've watched the big short, Ted
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.600]  Steve Carell in it and Christian Bale in it, it's based on the true story behind
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.900]  what happened with the housing crisis in 2006 through 2008.
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:06.460]  Christian Bale portrays Michael Burry, who's a famous investor who famously predicted the
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:11.660]  housing crisis before it happened and made a bunch of money at his hedge fund for his
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:16.180]  investors and himself investing according to that knowledge, that insight.
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:20.700]  Then at the very end of that movie, Michael Burry, who's sort of this like on the spectrum
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:30.460]  savant type person, it shows what his investments were in at the time that movie came out
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:37.360]  and he was investing heavily in natural water resources after he accurately predicted what
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.260]  would happen with the housing market.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:43.780]  So I'm very interested to see what the WEF has cooking, what the globalists have
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:46.860]  cooking as far as water resources are concerned.
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:52.980]  Are they going to institute a false shortage, a fake shortage in order to push us into
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:58.020]  crisis as a pretext to mitigate our rights even further and take over?
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.580]  I don't know.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:04.020]  Meanwhile, mandates are alive and well, Texas College imposes COVID vaccine mandates for
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.180]  students and faculty.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:09.940]  The Baylor College of Medicine issued an email declaring that all students, faculty and
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:17.460]  employees must receive the new COVID vaccine by the end of November.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:22.180]  Email from the Texas based college sent on September 28th claims the vaccine is an important
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:26.300]  tool to protect yourself and others from the effects of COVID despite admitting protection
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.220]  from the previous COVID shot fades over time.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:33.220]  An updated COVID vaccine has been approved by the FDA and is now available.
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:38.220]  The email states a single dose is recommended for individuals six months and older.
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:43.260]  And I believe that the FDA actually only approved this vaccine for people 12 years
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:47.420]  and older, but there's an emergency use authorization that allows the six months
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:48.420]  and older.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:52.660]  So this is really kind of a mischaracterization of what happened because protection from prior
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:57.420]  vaccination fades over time and this updated vaccine better matches the currently circulating
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.420]  strains.
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:12:59.820]  The updated dose is recommended.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.500]  So there you have it, folks.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.100]  Mandates are alive and well.
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.460]  We gave our rights away with the pandemic the last time and now they are gone forever
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.940]  unless we reclaim them.
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:12.060]  I want to open up the phone lines because in the next segment, I think I want to start
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:14.940]  taking calls at least by half past the hour.
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:19.700]  Make sure you call in 877-789-2539.
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:23.900]  And that's 877-789-2539.
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.780]  I want to hear what you think about all of this news that we've been covering tonight.
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.620]  Everything that's going on, whether you think they're going to Institute a fake water
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.620]  shortage.
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.660]  What do you think is going to happen in 2024?
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:37.540]  Do you think that they're going to successfully get Trump off the ballot or at least silence
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.380]  him during this campaign?
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.260]  Trump did sue Christopher Steele over the hoax dossier.
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.260]  Finally this is happening.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.740]  Zero Hedge reports today.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:50.180]  Former president Trump is suing Christopher Steele, the former MI6 spook who assembled
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:56.500]  the infamous Steele dossier, a collection of fabricated Kremlin-y rumors about Donald
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:03.380]  Trump, which was funded by Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign via a law firm intermediary
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:08.660]  and primarily sub-sourced from a Russian analyst, Igor Danchenko, who was later found
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:13.720]  not guilty of giving false statements to the FBI, even though these hoax allegations
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.240]  were determined to be false and funded by the Clinton campaign.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.040]  Why is it, again, like every time I see stuff like this, it just makes me think of a clip
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.480]  that we showed at the beginning of the show of Joe Biden talking about how were
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.960]  the extremists coming out against freedom of speech, coming out against freedom of the
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:32.360]  press who want to burn books, who are dog whistling to Nazis, despite the fact
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.040]  that the left is the one primarily interested in funding literal Nazis.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:42.080]  Why is it that they can get away with doing stuff like this, literally funding misinformation,
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:48.880]  using the intelligence community, and leveraging international relations to formally institute
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.200]  and propagate disinformation?
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.840]  They're the ones that can get away with this, but we need to be censored on social
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:58.680]  media because freedom of speech is a danger to the truth?
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:02.240]  Biden's coming out saying that people don't know what to believe anymore because
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.720]  free speech is rampant on acts.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:10.520]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is funding fake news of Russian collusion against her.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:15.280]  There's been a series of Russian collusion allegations against the Trump administration,
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:20.240]  and no one has been held accountable for it.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:26.000]  And the Clintons fired up the Clinton Foundation again recently in order to support the rebuilding
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.960]  of Ukraine, even though Ukraine is still being invaded and destroyed.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.160]  It doesn't make any sense to me how these people get away with this.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.880]  When are we going to stand up and do something?
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.960]  Call in 877-789-2539.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:40.960]  Again, that's 877-789-2539.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.360]  I want to hear what you think about all this.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.760]  Do you think that these people are ever going to be held accountable?
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.600]  Make sure you visit infowarsestore.com and get something to help keep us on the air.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.520]  We need your help, folks.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.800]  We need you to help us fight against tyranny.

[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.440]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.440]  You wanted to plug Rainforce.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.440]  Do you like Rainforce?
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.440]  Yeah.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.440]  Yeah.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.240]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.220]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mikovitch.
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:11.580]  Four books with Project Veritas whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.900]  That's because I use Brainforce every day.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.820]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:23.660]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins, but the one thing
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:28.220]  that I have really found that makes a difference is Brainforce.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:33.040]  I'll take Brainforce in the morning, right before I go to my computer, and I'm good
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.060]  for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:41.500]  So it really is true that Brainforce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.500]  writing.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.500]  All right.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.500]  We love you.

[01:19:58.170 --> 01:20:06.890]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:23.340]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, folks. I will be taking your calls for the remainder
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:33.660]  of the hour. Make sure you call in 877-789-2539. Again, that's 877-789-2539. First up, let's
[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:42.300]  hear from Name Redacted in New York. You're on the air.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:52.300]  How you doing? Good. Good. So I'm a healthcare worker and I work for a major New York medical
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:57.500]  center. And something that I wanted to bring up is the fact that we just got our flu vaccines,
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:02.060]  which are mandatory for all employees. I want to zoom out and give you a little bit of a
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:08.540]  timeline. The flu vaccine was invented in the 30s and it was made available to the public through
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:15.260]  military testing, et cetera, in 1945. So that means that it's been around for 78 years.
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:21.340]  So the mandate for employees to get the flu vaccine at this major medical center was
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:31.020]  October of 2016. COVID dropped, the pandemic dropped, December of 2019. So up to that point,
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:38.860]  October of 2016, the flu vaccine had been around for 73, 74 years, something like that.
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:45.100]  So what are the chances? And at the time, everybody was very confused. Like,
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:49.660]  why are we being mandated to get the flu vaccine? And the excuse was,
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:54.300]  well, we do no harm to the public, right? So that doesn't make any sense because the amount
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:59.820]  of traffic that you get in a major medical center is, I mean, all kinds of people are coming
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:06.940]  in. You know, patients, visitors, first responders, it's like Grand Central Terminal, you know?
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:13.180]  So what are the chances if you run that through your supercomputer that they mandated a vaccine,
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:16.300]  which they've never had done before in what, 74 years?
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:17.360]  Right.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:24.380]  Three years previous to COVID dropping. It's a titration.
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:29.100]  So you think it was a test run to like a proof of concept to, hey, if we can get this
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:33.820]  done, then it'll be easier down the road to force other vaccines
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:37.580]  and we'll sort of accustomed the people that work for us to this sort of mandate?
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:43.820]  Yeah, I think it was normalization. I think it was a titration of the normalization.
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:47.180]  I think it was, you know, incrementalism.
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:53.180]  Yeah. That makes a lot of sense to me. What are the efficacy rates of the flu vaccine? Isn't
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:57.900]  it just sort of hit or miss every season anyway? It's a guess, yeah.
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:05.580]  Yeah. And if we didn't use the flu vaccine ever, would it have a negative or positive impact
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:13.420]  on herd immunity to the flu generally? I don't know. It's not exactly my department.
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:18.860]  I mean, I don't know how you're going to run those numbers, but it just seems utterly
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:26.140]  impossible to me that having 70 some odd years to do it, all of a sudden you just
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:33.020]  mandate this vaccine, which everybody was up in arms about, 36 months before the big one hit.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:36.860]  Yeah. No, I'm with you. I think that's very suspicious and
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:39.660]  alarming. I wish that we would have noticed that in 2016 when it happened,
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:42.620]  so we could have put a stop to it then. Thank you so much for your call. I appreciate it.
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:45.580]  I want to hear next from Bart in Florida. Bart, how are you today?
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:50.460]  Yeah. I want to talk about the new COVID shot and the
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:58.140]  mandate. It's being mandated at universities. And why? Because I believe this one is going
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:04.380]  to be a doozy and they want to sterilize as many young people as possible. Back to you, Chase.
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.980]  So you think that the COVID vaccines actually sterilize?
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:12.300]  Oh, that's what Alex has been telling us. Absolutely.
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:19.340]  Yeah. Yeah. I'm interested to hear. Yeah. I think that's a very reasonable take that these
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:23.580]  vaccines could have alarming effects on things like fertility. Certainly everything else that
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:26.540]  we've been doing for the last 50 years seems to. I mean, if you just look at the studies,
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:32.220]  it's not arguable that sperm counts and fertility rates have plummeted. I mean,
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:36.860]  we're coming to a place where we're entering the movie Children of Men. I don't know if you've
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:39.260]  ever seen that movie before, but the whole premise of that movie is that nobody can
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:46.380]  have kids anymore. Yeah. You know, the lucky ones, if they just get sterilized,
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:51.260]  they're going to be the lucky ones. Yeah. Well, obviously the left is pro-sterilization
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:58.060]  because that is their suggested response to the whole trans issue. I mean, if you actually
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:04.860]  think about what the left deems to be healthcare and just and righteous and compassionate
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:10.460]  for transgender people beginning at the ages of 12 or however little they are, what they
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:15.980]  recommend is mass sterilization. And we're the Nazis, right? So somebody's transgender,
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:20.620]  or they show symptoms of perhaps being transgender, you know, even prior to puberty.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:26.220]  And the left says, okay, what we need to do is we need to sterilize these people, regardless of
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:29.980]  what their parents say, because they've demonstrated these symptoms. That's mass
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:35.980]  sterilization because you can't go through transition without being sterilized. Whether
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:40.700]  you're going from female to male or male to female, your fertility is just shot. You're
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:45.820]  screwed, right? And so that's what the left says. Mass sterilize all of the trans people.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:52.140]  That is the compassionate move. And I wouldn't be surprised one bit if these vaccines, even if
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:55.260]  these vaccines specifically don't impact fertility, which I'm not saying they don't,
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:59.900]  but even if they don't, these mandates set the stage for other products, other vaccines,
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:05.420]  other medications, other procedures down the road to be mandated that would force
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.620]  depopulate. Thank you so much for your call, Bart. I do appreciate it. Let's hear from
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:13.900]  Corn Pop in Maine. Corn Pop, what's on your mind? Hey, how are you doing? Good, man.
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:18.540]  Can you hear me all right? You sound great. All right. Yeah. So the first thing I wanted
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:25.740]  to say about the vaccine is if a new break-in, a new thing that just came out was that
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:32.460]  the vaccine was actually produced by the US military and was thrown labels on it by
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:35.260]  Pfizer and all that. And that was actually under the Trump administration.
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:40.700]  That's very interesting. Well, we know that Operation Warp Speed was under the Trump
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:46.060]  administration, so there's no doubt about it that these vaccines were catalyzed and created
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:50.700]  under his presidency. Do you think that makes him responsible for it or do you think that's
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:54.940]  just like an oversight? No. So the reason why I bring that up is because of a report
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:27:00.620]  that was actually done by Greg Reese, where he said that a lot of the vaccines were failing,
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:05.980]  right? Yeah. So I'm possibly throwing out there that maybe under the Trump administration,
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:09.340]  because if you remember when he actually talked about other remedies,
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:13.900]  hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, what happened to him? He got shut down.
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:20.300]  He got shut down. So maybe all the vaccines under the Trump administration were failing and
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:27.980]  now this new vaccine is the death jet. Not being a conspiracy theorist, just maybe throwing
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:32.460]  that out there. But what I really wanted to talk about was 2024. What I think is going to
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:40.940]  happen in 2024, I think with Trump being indicted for the election of 2020, how do you finally
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:48.460]  prove, how do you finally present evidence that he has had that has, you can call it classified,
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:56.300]  whatever. How do you finally present that to the public in court? So I think that no matter
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:59.740]  what, I don't think we're going to have an election in 2024. I think they're going to try
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:04.860]  to shut it down. I think that Trump has been saying, he's been telling us for the longest time,
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:09.660]  what happens when you steal the diamonds? The diamonds have to be returned. I think we're going
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:13.980]  to get our four years back. I think Trump has been telling us this for a while. If you look at
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:24.620]  his new hat, even on his new hat, it says 45-47. It doesn't say 45 and 47. It says 45
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:27.740]  through 47. I haven't seen that. That's awesome.
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:32.700]  Trump also came out in his last speech and he said something about a second term.
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:38.860]  And he's talking about what's going on right now. You wouldn't want to claim it as a second
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:45.820]  term, but this term was to awaken the American people to finally show them what is going on.

[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:17.900]  to ban it. And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega threes.

[01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:21.049]  Fighting the good fight in the info war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.049 --> 01:33:24.889]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm Chase Geyser, we'll be taking your calls for the
[01:33:24.889 --> 01:33:26.809]  rest of the hour.
[01:33:26.809 --> 01:33:31.610]  Make sure you call in 877-792539 if you haven't called in yet.
[01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:36.130]  First up I want to take William in Arkansas, William what's on your mind?
[01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:50.170]  I want to go over the understanding of contamination, cross contamination, the three types of technique
[01:33:50.170 --> 01:33:52.049]  when you're dealing with healthcare.
[01:33:52.049 --> 01:33:56.450]  You've got the basic clean technique, soap and water, you've got disinfectant, which
[01:33:56.450 --> 01:34:04.370]  is just a simple disinfectant, a sterile field has to be totally free of all microorganisms.
[01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:09.410]  Those are three different techniques, if you throw a piece of tool, equipment, a dirty glove
[01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:15.170]  from one area to the other, you have cross contaminated those fields from a clean to
[01:34:15.170 --> 01:34:17.950]  a septic to a sterile field.
[01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:20.969]  When you're in the operating room, and I spent 24 years in the operating room, I've
[01:34:20.969 --> 01:34:28.490]  been a nurse since 86, I learned all this in the Army, Fort Sam Houston, in 84, I'm
[01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:33.089]  working off an education from a long time ago just for this subject matter, I'm not
[01:34:33.089 --> 01:34:38.769]  a virologist or microbiologist, but every time you turn on an autoclave, you are sterilizing
[01:34:38.769 --> 01:34:43.210]  things, I can break it down, I can break it all the way down to the DNA inside of
[01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:48.570]  a spore, a spore has a hard shell around it, I don't have time for all that, there's
[01:34:48.570 --> 01:34:54.849]  not an hour to do that, it's not an education seminar, but the literal rules in the operating
[01:34:54.849 --> 01:34:59.009]  room, let's say you're doing a total hip or a total joint, you keep the door shut
[01:34:59.009 --> 01:35:03.250]  once the patient's in the room, bones have a high propensity to become infected, once
[01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:07.290]  they do it's hard to get rid of it, you don't take a dirty mop handle, a mop head
[01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:12.210]  from one room to the next, that's cross contamination, but yet, the governor wants
[01:35:12.210 --> 01:35:16.809]  his face, normally it wasn't, New York and all these idiots all over the country,
[01:35:16.809 --> 01:35:21.429]  every doctor knows this, every surgeon knows this, every healthcare provider knows this,
[01:35:21.429 --> 01:35:28.130]  you have cross contaminated sick people into nursing homes, it's real basic, now I don't
[01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:36.769]  have a PhD, I'm not a dean at Harvard, I'm not the, you know, head of the local county
[01:35:36.769 --> 01:35:43.210]  health commission, if I were to take a bloody sponge from one room to the next, and squeeze
[01:35:43.210 --> 01:35:47.690]  it on the floor, and then argue with management that I didn't contaminate that
[01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:52.809]  next room, I mean it's just stupidity, you know, maybe I can be pregnant too, does
[01:35:52.809 --> 01:36:00.130]  it sound like I can be pregnant? So, you know, what's going on is just blatant
[01:36:00.130 --> 01:36:07.170]  ignorance in front of our face, the other thing I want to comment is on the
[01:36:07.170 --> 01:36:13.650]  colony that, northeast of Houston, I was raised in all of that area, that's going
[01:36:13.650 --> 01:36:18.610]  to contaminate the Sheldon water district area, the people that are
[01:36:18.610 --> 01:36:23.690]  receiving water down there, Galena Park area, along the ship channel and all that,
[01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:31.610]  Federal Road, you know, I'm just mentioning that so you people know the area very well, and
[01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:35.490]  that's where all that water goes, there's a canal runs right through the
[01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:41.490]  San Jacinto Community College, down into that whole water treatment
[01:36:41.490 --> 01:36:46.049]  facility that's there in Galena Park, right, and all that water that's going in
[01:36:46.049 --> 01:36:49.889]  those in a few years is going to be so nasty and contaminated, it'd be like
[01:36:49.889 --> 01:36:55.330]  Flint, Michigan, you know, you heard it first, you're on Alex Jones Show.
[01:36:55.330 --> 01:36:59.210]  Well, thank you so much for calling, I do appreciate it, let's hear next from Jay in Kentucky, Jay, what's on
[01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:09.650]  your mind? The sky's on my mind, no, you're doing a good job, I buy all the
[01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:14.089]  products there, and I'm waiting on some shirts, and anyways, I'm in the middle
[01:37:14.089 --> 01:37:18.490]  of a transition right now, I went from the middle class to get a divorce, and
[01:37:18.490 --> 01:37:21.650]  now I'm in the poor class. I'm sorry to hear that, man, you'll get through it. Yeah,
[01:37:21.650 --> 01:37:27.330]  yeah, I'm a little bummed out, but the good news is my brain's still functioning,
[01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:32.889]  and I'm a little disturbed to see that some people, they don't know how
[01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:37.090]  to use the internet, and they're not paying attention, and that Mr. T character,
[01:37:37.090 --> 01:37:43.170]  I always loved Mr. T, you know? Yeah, of course, ever since he was in Pee Wee Herman, man.
[01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:49.210]  Yeah, like even Pee Wee Herman was kind of funny, you know, and he was
[01:37:49.210 --> 01:37:54.490]  anyways, but they give him that damn shot, and geez Louise, you
[01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:58.610]  know, how can he not know what's going on with all the information here on
[01:37:58.610 --> 01:38:04.090]  the program and other programs? I sat with a couple of drivers in a Santa Fe
[01:38:04.090 --> 01:38:09.929]  lounge there, and they were in military, and we were talking about, I was wearing
[01:38:09.929 --> 01:38:16.730]  Alex Jones' right shirt. I spread the word all the time, I got
[01:38:16.730 --> 01:38:22.210]  all your shirts, and he's like, oh, Alex Jones is too much for me,
[01:38:22.210 --> 01:38:28.009]  but he knew all the commercials, and he knew all the
[01:38:28.009 --> 01:38:33.730]  Greg Reese reports, but he's a Joe Rogan fan, but some people, he
[01:38:33.769 --> 01:38:38.210]  said, oh, he's over the top, and this other military guy, who's Alex Jones? And the guy
[01:38:38.210 --> 01:38:43.969]  tried to explain to him, and I gave him the website, and I'm surprised
[01:38:43.969 --> 01:38:49.490]  people aren't as awake as they need to be, and I want to say, as for Owen, you
[01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:55.090]  know, I'm 59 years old, I don't have a whole lot to lose, and with the
[01:38:55.090 --> 01:38:59.090]  proper instructions from the proper general, and I don't know who that
[01:38:59.090 --> 01:39:04.049]  general is going to be, you know, we could set up a line of armed
[01:39:04.049 --> 01:39:08.690]  minutemen to say, you want this guy? You come get him through this line of
[01:39:08.690 --> 01:39:13.690]  armed military men in front of the jail, and really, I'm surprised that people
[01:39:13.690 --> 01:39:17.889]  aren't up with their arms demanding to release the January 6
[01:39:17.889 --> 01:39:22.929]  people. I mean, give me the sign, and I'm on my
[01:39:22.929 --> 01:39:27.490]  way. Yeah, I'm with you, man. I feel frustrated, too. I was thinking
[01:39:27.490 --> 01:39:30.290]  about this earlier today, because, you know, we don't call for violence on this
[01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:35.330]  network, and I was thinking to myself, like, man, I'm surprised that we've gotten
[01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:40.610]  to a point in this country where no one's organized any violence, and I'm
[01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:45.009]  not advocating that, I'm just surprised that it hasn't happened, and I think
[01:39:45.009 --> 01:39:52.129]  the right thing to do is violence once civil disobedience sinks exhausted, and
[01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:56.410]  we haven't even begun to engage in civil disobedience, right? We saw with the
[01:39:56.410 --> 01:40:01.889]  civil rights revolution, that whole movement, the civil disobedience worked.
[01:40:01.889 --> 01:40:07.490]  They would sit in at restaurants that sought to divide people or not allow
[01:40:07.490 --> 01:40:10.129]  people of color, right? They would sit in, they would do it anyway, they'd get
[01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:14.889]  arrested, and that worked, and so what we have to be thinking about is ways in
[01:40:14.889 --> 01:40:18.610]  which we can engage in civil disobedience. So, okay, if you're going to
[01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:23.330]  arrest January 6 protesters, then I, as a small business owner, am not going to pay
[01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:26.570]  federal taxes, and you can arrest me if you want, I'm not going to do anything
[01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:31.170]  violent, but I am not going to write a check to the government, or if you're
[01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:35.650]  going to fund actual Nazis, enemies of America, literally enemies of America, the
[01:40:35.650 --> 01:40:38.650]  Nazis, you're going to fund them in Ukraine, then I am not going to pay
[01:40:38.650 --> 01:40:42.129]  federal income tax. That's the kind of stuff that we need to be doing, it's
[01:40:42.129 --> 01:40:46.429]  painful, it's hard, people have to risk things like having accesses or being
[01:40:46.429 --> 01:40:50.650]  arrested, but that's the step you take before you just show up with an AR-15.
[01:40:50.849 --> 01:40:55.370]  Now, same thing with the border. I am, I can't believe that no one in Texas
[01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:58.330]  hasn't organized some sort of a militia to just go say, hey, if you're
[01:40:58.330 --> 01:41:01.650]  not going to protect the border, we'll do it, and it would be very tempting for
[01:41:01.650 --> 01:41:04.889]  me to volunteer for something like that, frankly, to be honest with you, and
[01:41:04.889 --> 01:41:07.410]  I'm not saying that's the right thing to do, but that would be the type
[01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:10.730]  of thing that I'm, I'm surprised hasn't happened, and if it were to happen, I
[01:41:10.730 --> 01:41:14.849]  would seriously consider it, but the same thing goes, like civil
[01:41:14.849 --> 01:41:18.730]  disobedience first, so those are my thoughts on it, what do you think?
[01:41:18.730 --> 01:41:24.250]  I agree 100%, I mean, I just can't believe that this country has fallen. I
[01:41:24.250 --> 01:41:30.809]  mean, it's, yeah, and we really need real generals, real people to
[01:41:30.809 --> 01:41:34.450]  stand up and say, we're gonna, we're gonna form over here, a
[01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:37.610]  militia, and we're gonna do just like you said, go to them, go to
[01:41:37.610 --> 01:41:41.769]  the border, go to the, really, we just need to go to the Pentagon
[01:41:41.769 --> 01:41:46.490]  and just start tearing all these bureaucrats out of these offices and
[01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:50.769]  say you're done, and stop all this money going over to the Ukraine, I mean, it's
[01:41:50.769 --> 01:41:54.849]  in the House and in the Senate, there are a bunch of criminals, this is
[01:41:54.849 --> 01:41:59.250]  worse than the Mafia. 100%. Thank you so much for your call, I do appreciate it.

[01:45:04.849 --> 01:45:08.490]  they can only be obtained through diet. They can be found
[01:45:08.490 --> 01:45:12.290]  in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying
[01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:15.570]  to ban it. And they can be found in fish, which are
[01:45:15.570 --> 01:45:20.170]  arguably the best source of omega threes. But the problem
[01:45:20.170 --> 01:45:24.490]  today is finding fish without a high mercury content. Your

[01:47:12.210 --> 01:47:19.969]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I am Chase Geyser,
[01:47:19.969 --> 01:47:21.929]  filling in for the great Alex Jones. We're going to be taking
[01:47:21.929 --> 01:47:25.650]  calls for this segment before the Sunday Night Live broadcast
[01:47:25.650 --> 01:47:30.809]  in the next hour. Next up, who do I want to talk to? Let's
[01:47:30.809 --> 01:47:39.370]  hear from Jefferson in Virginia. Happy Sunday, Chase. Happy Sunday,
[01:47:39.370 --> 01:47:40.049]  sir. How are you?
[01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:43.690]  I'm all right. I'm just confused by these medical
[01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:46.330]  professionals that just accept the notion that they can get a
[01:47:46.330 --> 01:47:49.370]  flu vaccine every year mandated for them. How do you
[01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:52.090]  have any idea what's in anything that's being injected
[01:47:52.090 --> 01:47:55.009]  in you anymore? Why would you trust them to not put in
[01:47:55.009 --> 01:47:56.809]  the injection, whatever they want to put in it?
[01:47:57.610 --> 01:48:01.250]  Yeah, that's one of the reasons that we haven't given our
[01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:03.650]  kids the flu shot, and I don't think we're going to do
[01:48:03.650 --> 01:48:07.290]  it anyway. Ever. But one of the reasons that we haven't
[01:48:07.330 --> 01:48:09.889]  done it is because it's like, how do we know that the COVID
[01:48:09.889 --> 01:48:12.610]  vaccine isn't just laced in it? How do we know that it's not
[01:48:12.610 --> 01:48:13.650]  laced with COVID vacs?
[01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:16.610]  Right, they're putting mRNA in your food now and you don't
[01:48:16.610 --> 01:48:18.929]  know it. But when it comes to the emergency use
[01:48:18.929 --> 01:48:23.730]  authorization for this latest so-called booster, how do
[01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:26.210]  they get an emergency use authorization when there are
[01:48:26.370 --> 01:48:28.410]  therapeutics on the market that they admit are
[01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:32.210]  therapeutic, like ivermectin, or hydroxychloroquine, or
[01:48:32.370 --> 01:48:34.690]  monoclonal antibodies, if they know what kind of
[01:48:34.690 --> 01:48:37.170]  antibody they're trying to create with this new booster,
[01:48:37.730 --> 01:48:41.250]  then they know how to create that monoclonal antibody and
[01:48:41.250 --> 01:48:44.370]  use that as a therapeutic. So we've completely forgotten
[01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:46.809]  about Regeneron, and how that was an effective
[01:48:46.809 --> 01:48:49.570]  therapeutic the last time. So there should be no
[01:48:50.049 --> 01:48:50.450]  emergency use authorization.
[01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:53.889]  The emergency use authorization just applies to
[01:48:53.889 --> 01:48:56.090]  people six months old up to 12 years old, right? They
[01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:59.009]  had to do that to get the very young demographic. And
[01:48:59.009 --> 01:49:01.129]  that's the demographic that's least vulnerable to the
[01:49:01.129 --> 01:49:04.250]  actual virus itself. It's not an emergency for that
[01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:05.049]  age range.
[01:49:05.769 --> 01:49:08.290]  Right. But but they're trying to sterilize people and you
[01:49:08.290 --> 01:49:11.210]  not realize you're sterilized until 20 years from now, when
[01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:14.009]  you actually try to have children and can't. That's what
[01:49:14.009 --> 01:49:15.809]  they're counting on is that most people aren't trying to
[01:49:15.809 --> 01:49:18.929]  have children anyway. If you vaccinate a six year old,
[01:49:19.129 --> 01:49:22.049]  she's not going to try to have kids for 16 years or
[01:49:22.049 --> 01:49:26.410]  more. That's when you find out you're sterile. It's a slow
[01:49:26.410 --> 01:49:30.370]  kill of the population without us knowing what's going on. So
[01:49:30.370 --> 01:49:33.170]  they get away with it before we actually find out what
[01:49:33.170 --> 01:49:33.889]  they've done to us.
[01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:39.929]  Yep, 100%. And just the amount of cowardice that it
[01:49:39.929 --> 01:49:42.889]  takes to be convinced that the right thing to do is to give
[01:49:42.889 --> 01:49:45.929]  your infant a COVID vaccine is just beyond me. Because if
[01:49:45.929 --> 01:49:48.370]  you do just two seconds worth of research, even the
[01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:51.450]  government published research, you'll see that like less
[01:49:51.450 --> 01:49:54.730]  than 2000 kids or something like that, under the age of
[01:49:54.730 --> 01:50:00.170]  12 months old, have been victims of COVID. And that
[01:50:00.170 --> 01:50:01.969]  number is even questionable, right? Because these kids
[01:50:01.969 --> 01:50:03.490]  might have had COVID, but they might have also had
[01:50:03.490 --> 01:50:06.250]  leukemia, but they got marked as a COVID death. So the fact
[01:50:06.250 --> 01:50:08.730]  that you're so afraid of this virus, that you're going to
[01:50:08.730 --> 01:50:11.370]  inject this substance into your kids, because you think
[01:50:11.370 --> 01:50:15.010]  that it's safer to do that than it is to allow them to
[01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:17.849]  have the virus is just totally beyond me. And
[01:50:17.849 --> 01:50:19.730]  frankly, the fact that we trust these pharmaceutical
[01:50:19.730 --> 01:50:21.730]  companies at all, after all the things that they have
[01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:25.250]  done over the years that have clearly been lethal, is
[01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:27.090]  beyond me. If you look at what happened in the 80s, I
[01:50:27.090 --> 01:50:28.929]  talked about it with Alex when I was a guest on this
[01:50:28.929 --> 01:50:32.010]  show. I talked about it a number of times on my own
[01:50:32.170 --> 01:50:34.849]  podcast. I'm a type A severe hemophiliac. I have a
[01:50:34.849 --> 01:50:38.129]  bleeding disorder and I have to take injections in
[01:50:38.129 --> 01:50:42.450]  order to clot. Otherwise my joints cripple and I bleed
[01:50:42.450 --> 01:50:44.129]  internally to death. My life expectancy without
[01:50:44.129 --> 01:50:47.090]  medicine is 11 years. And in the 80s, the way they
[01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:50.450]  treated hemophilia before they developed new medicines
[01:50:50.730 --> 01:50:52.490]  was they would do blood transfusions and they would
[01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:55.650]  create synthetic medicine using blood donors. And the
[01:50:55.650 --> 01:50:59.650]  pharmaceutical companies knew four years while Fauci
[01:50:59.650 --> 01:51:02.170]  was involved in leadership, mind you, and that the
[01:51:02.170 --> 01:51:04.370]  blood products they were using to create the medicine
[01:51:04.370 --> 01:51:08.769]  for hemophiliacs contained HIV and hepatitis and
[01:51:08.769 --> 01:51:11.370]  estimates of up to 10,000 hemophiliacs in the United
[01:51:11.370 --> 01:51:14.690]  States alone. It's a very rare condition. Up to 10,000
[01:51:14.690 --> 01:51:17.290]  of them died of AIDS in the 80s because the drug
[01:51:17.290 --> 01:51:20.889]  companies did not tell the mothers of these children
[01:51:20.969 --> 01:51:23.929]  that they were injecting their kids with HIV. This
[01:51:23.929 --> 01:51:26.730]  is documented. This is not disputed. There were
[01:51:26.730 --> 01:51:28.969]  lawsuits over this. There were settlements over this in
[01:51:28.969 --> 01:51:31.849]  the 90s, and they knew four years these drugs were
[01:51:31.849 --> 01:51:34.969]  contaminated. They gave them to parents unwittingly to
[01:51:34.969 --> 01:51:37.209]  inject into their children because their thought process
[01:51:37.209 --> 01:51:39.530]  was it was better to die of AIDS than it was to
[01:51:39.530 --> 01:51:42.010]  die of hemophilia, which was not their decision
[01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:44.769]  to make. And then once they got caught for it, what
[01:51:44.769 --> 01:51:46.690]  did they do with their inventory? Well, it was
[01:51:46.690 --> 01:51:48.410]  illegal to sell the inventory here in the United
[01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:50.209]  States once they got caught for it, but they had
[01:51:50.209 --> 01:51:52.209]  all this backlog of inventory to sell. So they
[01:51:52.209 --> 01:51:54.969]  sold it to third world countries. So they sold the
[01:51:54.969 --> 01:51:57.570]  contaminated products overseas to countries that did
[01:51:57.570 --> 01:51:59.889]  not outlaw it or had not yet outlawed it, knowing
[01:51:59.889 --> 01:52:02.129]  that it would contaminate and infect thousands of
[01:52:02.129 --> 01:52:05.370]  hemophiliacs all over the world with HIV and
[01:52:05.370 --> 01:52:08.170]  hepatitis, which of course becomes AIDS and kills
[01:52:08.170 --> 01:52:10.969]  them. And so we're supposed to trust that the
[01:52:10.969 --> 01:52:12.490]  government and these pharmaceutical companies
[01:52:12.490 --> 01:52:15.010]  actually care about our health? They only care
[01:52:15.010 --> 01:52:17.170]  about the bottom line. They only care about
[01:52:17.170 --> 01:52:19.570]  power. These mandates have nothing to do with
[01:52:19.570 --> 01:52:22.490]  saving lives. They only have to do with making
[01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:25.570]  tremendous amounts of money and empowering the
[01:52:25.570 --> 01:52:27.969]  government in a greater and greater way until
[01:52:27.969 --> 01:52:31.570]  you have no rights left. They do not care about
[01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:34.530]  you folks. All of the world's genocides, mass
[01:52:34.530 --> 01:52:37.370]  murders have been committed by governments. The
[01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:39.490]  government doesn't care about you because no one
[01:52:39.490 --> 01:52:41.570]  in the government actually feels responsible for
[01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:43.209]  what the government does. These institutions are
[01:52:43.209 --> 01:52:46.090]  so large, like Enron or something, where if
[01:52:46.090 --> 01:52:48.370]  they're doing something unethical, no individual
[01:52:48.370 --> 01:52:50.769]  entity within that organization actually feels
[01:52:50.769 --> 01:52:52.610]  responsible for the unethical thing being
[01:52:52.610 --> 01:52:54.610]  done. Oh, you know, I'm a member of the Nazi
[01:52:54.610 --> 01:52:56.610]  Party, but I'm just a guard, so it's not my fault
[01:52:56.610 --> 01:52:58.290]  that these people are being gassed because I'm just
[01:52:58.290 --> 01:53:00.530]  a guard. But everybody plays a small part in this
[01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:03.209]  corruption, but offloads all of the guilt or
[01:53:03.209 --> 01:53:05.330]  accountability to other people. So these
[01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:07.769]  organizations, once they reach this size, like
[01:53:07.769 --> 01:53:09.370]  these pharmaceutical companies, like the
[01:53:09.370 --> 01:53:11.809]  government, they get to a point where they do
[01:53:11.809 --> 01:53:15.010]  incredibly evil things, but no individual within
[01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:17.969]  these organizations actually feels responsible or
[01:53:17.969 --> 01:53:21.730]  culpable for the evil that's being done. Right?
[01:53:21.730 --> 01:53:24.370]  It's like American taxpayers. You probably
[01:53:24.370 --> 01:53:26.049]  pay taxes. I've certainly paid taxes in the
[01:53:26.049 --> 01:53:30.129]  past. Do any of you feel responsible for the
[01:53:30.129 --> 01:53:32.610]  Nazis being funded in Ukraine? Probably not,
[01:53:32.610 --> 01:53:33.929]  because you're being forced to do it. Well,
[01:53:33.929 --> 01:53:36.049]  I'm telling you, if you pay taxes, you are
[01:53:36.049 --> 01:53:38.410]  partially responsible for the fact that Nazis are
[01:53:38.410 --> 01:53:40.570]  being funded in Ukraine. Next call, Alan,
[01:53:40.570 --> 01:53:44.290]  California. Alan, what's on your mind?
[01:53:44.290 --> 01:53:45.250]  Chase, you there?
[01:53:45.250 --> 01:53:47.170]  Yep, I can hear you.
[01:53:47.170 --> 01:53:49.410]  Wonderful. First of all, you're doing a very
[01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:51.809]  scholarly type of style, and I like it a lot.
[01:53:51.809 --> 01:53:52.330]  Thank you.
[01:53:53.250 --> 01:53:56.209]  And kind of funny, I called in on the one topic,
[01:53:56.209 --> 01:53:58.170]  you asked a question and I have an answer for
[01:53:58.170 --> 01:54:00.570]  you. But then you got into all this vaccine
[01:54:00.570 --> 01:54:03.730]  stuff and all the medical industry. I actually
[01:54:03.730 --> 01:54:06.209]  retired out of the health insurance industry
[01:54:06.610 --> 01:54:09.889]  here in California, which really drives a lot of
[01:54:09.889 --> 01:54:13.490]  it. And the bottom line, a couple things.
[01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:16.730]  Number one, after 30 years in the health
[01:54:16.730 --> 01:54:19.690]  industry, just put it this way, the health
[01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:21.969]  insurance companies don't want you healthy.
[01:54:22.969 --> 01:54:25.969]  It's kind of anything with the government or
[01:54:25.969 --> 01:54:28.570]  big corporation. They want you sick. They
[01:54:28.570 --> 01:54:32.209]  want you having chronic diseases because they
[01:54:32.209 --> 01:54:35.090]  make more money. Not only do the health, not
[01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:37.450]  only does the pharmaceutical companies and all
[01:54:37.450 --> 01:54:40.330]  the big medical groups make more money, but the
[01:54:40.330 --> 01:54:42.370]  insurance companies make more money. And
[01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:44.730]  here's how it works. I don't want to take up
[01:54:44.730 --> 01:54:46.290]  all your time. I know we're limited.
[01:54:46.290 --> 01:54:46.690]  It's okay.
[01:54:46.769 --> 01:54:49.809]  Here's the big, here's the biggest part. The
[01:54:49.849 --> 01:54:53.129]  especially and Obama put this into overdrive
[01:54:53.170 --> 01:54:55.929]  with the Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act,
[01:54:55.969 --> 01:54:59.929]  you know, obviously backwards named because
[01:54:59.929 --> 01:55:03.170]  they put in that whole factor of the insurance
[01:55:03.170 --> 01:55:06.209]  companies could only make 10% profit on health
[01:55:06.209 --> 01:55:08.129]  insurance contract, meaning they had to pay out
[01:55:08.129 --> 01:55:10.450]  90% of all the money that was being paid into
[01:55:10.450 --> 01:55:13.730]  them by all the consumers and into health care.
[01:55:14.129 --> 01:55:17.490]  Excuse me, they had to re reimburse for medical
[01:55:17.490 --> 01:55:21.450]  procedures and in prescription drugs. Okay. So
[01:55:21.450 --> 01:55:23.410]  they were only allowed to have 10% across the
[01:55:23.410 --> 01:55:26.170]  top. That's what that law change did. Right.
[01:55:26.889 --> 01:55:29.690]  So what happened was, you're you're a smart
[01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:31.290]  enough guy, you know some math, would you
[01:55:31.290 --> 01:55:35.129]  rather have 10% of $100,000 a year, which
[01:55:35.129 --> 01:55:37.490]  is only 10 grand? Or would you rather have
[01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:39.730]  right percent of more expensive health care
[01:55:39.730 --> 01:55:42.090]  becomes the more they can crank the premiums,
[01:55:42.090 --> 01:55:43.809]  which means the greater volume of profits that
[01:55:43.809 --> 01:55:46.690]  they make, and then the bigger profit for them.
[01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:49.690]  So you know, I've been telling people this for
[01:55:49.889 --> 01:55:54.330]  for years. It's infuriating, you know, they
[01:55:54.370 --> 01:55:56.610]  they go, Oh, no, they, they don't want me to
[01:55:56.610 --> 01:55:59.490]  go, I think it's the opposite. They want you
[01:55:59.490 --> 01:56:00.969]  to go to the doctor, they want you to get
[01:56:00.969 --> 01:56:02.929]  more prescriptions, because then they get to
[01:56:02.929 --> 01:56:04.690]  turn around, because every health insurance
[01:56:04.690 --> 01:56:07.170]  company has to justify their race to all the
[01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:09.450]  50 states and or the federal government when it
[01:56:09.450 --> 01:56:12.849]  comes to Medicare. So then that way, they can
[01:56:12.849 --> 01:56:16.129]  go to the Medicare if it's a federal Medicare
[01:56:16.129 --> 01:56:18.330]  program, or the different states and say, Well,
[01:56:18.490 --> 01:56:21.650]  we got to raise our rates 25%. Because look
[01:56:21.650 --> 01:56:24.209]  at all the utilization. And then of course, the
[01:56:24.209 --> 01:56:29.969]  rest of it is a circle. So that's what
[01:56:29.969 --> 01:56:31.690]  they're doing. And one last thing, one of the
[01:56:31.730 --> 01:56:35.209]  other and all the prior callers with comments
[01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:37.690]  and the nurses and stuff, and they're right on
[01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:39.370]  the spot. But here's the funny other quirky
[01:56:39.370 --> 01:56:41.650]  thing. And God just puts me in weird places in
[01:56:41.650 --> 01:56:43.490]  my life, my entire life. He's blessed me
[01:56:43.490 --> 01:56:47.809]  tremendously. My brother in law happens to be an
[01:56:47.809 --> 01:56:50.250]  actuary in the big health insurance industry
[01:56:50.250 --> 01:56:53.090]  for decades. I'm on the marketing side. See, I
[01:56:53.090 --> 01:56:55.510]  saw this, because I saw marketing with the
[01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:57.450]  sales with the premiums going up. And by the
[01:56:57.450 --> 01:57:00.090]  way, my commissions were going up, too. Okay.
[01:57:00.330 --> 01:57:02.450]  But I saw the premiums getting ridiculous where
[01:57:02.450 --> 01:57:04.490]  people can afford it. But my brother in law is
[01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:07.049]  on the actuary side. So the point is, he's
[01:57:07.049 --> 01:57:09.929]  in the corporate side. And it comes back to that
[01:57:09.929 --> 01:57:12.450]  guy who said, you know, I don't understand how
[01:57:12.450 --> 01:57:13.929]  doctors and these people are taking the
[01:57:13.929 --> 01:57:16.330]  vaccinations. In the corporate side, he was
[01:57:16.330 --> 01:57:18.530]  getting a hefty set, well he still does, he's
[01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:20.889]  getting a hefty salary from this corporation to
[01:57:20.889 --> 01:57:23.889]  do all this stuff. And they mandate him and
[01:57:23.889 --> 01:57:25.969]  his wife and they're in their late 50s and
[01:57:25.969 --> 01:57:29.889]  early 60s to get vaccinations. But see, he
[01:57:29.889 --> 01:57:32.129]  still has that, he has that cognitive
[01:57:32.129 --> 01:57:34.250]  dissonance. He thinks the health insurance
[01:57:34.250 --> 01:57:35.629]  company is doing a good thing.
[01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:37.730]  Yeah, well, people don't even understand the
[01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:40.070]  depths of the corruption, the conflicts of
[01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:41.530]  interest that exist in our country today. Thank
