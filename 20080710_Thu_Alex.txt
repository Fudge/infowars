[00:00.000 --> 00:08.080]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio
[00:08.080 --> 00:25.400]  Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.400 --> 00:33.720]  We have a very important broadcast lined up for you today. I tell you, this radio show
[00:33.720 --> 00:39.120]  gets more and more focused, more and more on target. I am really proud of the work that
[00:39.120 --> 00:43.360]  we're all doing here, my team, my producer, the folks in the office, John Harmon up at
[00:43.360 --> 00:48.680]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network. I'm very, very thankful to be on the air with
[00:48.680 --> 00:55.520]  all of you. We're going to be talking to Dr. Doug Rocky, the former head of the Pentagon's
[00:55.520 --> 01:01.600]  depleted uranium program, studying it, deploying it, using it. He'll be joining us in one hour
[01:01.600 --> 01:07.200]  because he's put out a report on the dead and dying, intensifying from wars all over
[01:07.200 --> 01:13.080]  the planet where it's been used and testing grounds. Their own admitted manuals on it
[01:13.080 --> 01:20.800]  say that if the troops come in contact with it, it will kill them. But in the new system,
[01:20.800 --> 01:25.360]  in the last 18 years now, they just say that, well, it is deadly, but we're going to use
[01:25.360 --> 01:31.200]  it and you're going to live and sleep in areas that have been bombed by it. So get ready
[01:31.200 --> 01:37.400]  to die. So many have already died or barely survived having scores of cancers removed.
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.080]  This is how the globalists operate. You know, they use the image of the troops and the police
[01:42.080 --> 01:47.640]  and the firemen to get glory for themselves and the establishment, to carry out their
[01:47.640 --> 01:52.840]  policies and operations. And then if you ask for any healthcare or any support, you get
[01:52.840 --> 01:59.720]  zero. In fact, you even get your second amendment attacked. That's what you have to look forward
[01:59.720 --> 02:04.240]  to from your new world order masters after you're done serving them. And then I like
[02:04.240 --> 02:08.880]  to have him up at least once a month. He's going to be on with us for two hours. He is
[02:08.880 --> 02:15.360]  Alan Watt cutting through the matrix. And I want to open the phones up today for pretty
[02:15.360 --> 02:21.120]  much the full two hours with Alan Watt. We'll also open the phones up for Dr. Doug Rocky
[02:21.120 --> 02:26.040]  next hour. I want to take a lot of calls today. We'll also take some of your calls in this
[02:26.040 --> 02:34.120]  first hour at 1-800-259-9231. I also like to hear from Westerners throughout the broadcast
[02:34.120 --> 02:37.280]  because I know you've been chomping at the bit to call in. I've gotten your emails and
[02:37.280 --> 02:43.440]  I'll open the phones up Sunday. And more than half the callers called in saying they'd seen
[02:43.440 --> 02:47.200]  the new film Truth Rising and really loved it. I want to hear why you like it or why
[02:47.200 --> 02:51.680]  you don't like it. What you think the most important facets of the film Truth Rising
[02:51.680 --> 03:04.360]  are. So Dr. Doug Rocky and Alan Watt coming up today and your phone calls 1-800-259-9231.
[03:04.360 --> 03:09.720]  Now let me go ahead and run over some of the news we have here in front of us today that
[03:09.720 --> 03:21.720]  I will cover in this first hour. OPEC chief warns of unlimited oil prices if Iran is attacked.
[03:21.720 --> 03:28.480]  Unlimited oil prices. We'll break that down. Rice warns Iran, US will defend Israel. Translate
[03:28.480 --> 03:34.720]  that through the galactic translator. And what does that mean? It means if Israel blows
[03:34.720 --> 03:38.120]  the living daylights out of hundreds of sites in your country and kills tens of thousands
[03:38.120 --> 03:45.000]  of your citizens in a premeditated fashion while menacing you with 400 nukes, we will
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.120]  nuke you as well. You will not defend yourself. This is a new rule in warfare. You lay there
[03:52.120 --> 03:59.400]  and you take it. Scum. Bush's secret army of snoops and snitches. A great story out
[03:59.400 --> 04:06.480]  of the progressive major magazine. The problem is they call it Bush's secret army. This
[04:06.480 --> 04:12.360]  stuff was set up long before George Bush came into office. Barack Obama or McCain will both
[04:12.360 --> 04:18.920]  use it. They run nothing. They're puppets. And you just have Barack Obama and Hillary
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.720]  vote for unlimited warrantless spying on the American people, the public end of the Fourth
[04:23.720 --> 04:30.920]  Amendment and sanctioned all the criminal activities. It's unbelievable. Just stop believing
[04:30.920 --> 04:37.640]  in the left-right paradigm. It's what's defeating us for heaven's sakes. Also, there's video
[04:37.640 --> 04:41.920]  of police beating the daylights out of a woman and then the news calls it a tussle. Every
[04:41.920 --> 04:47.000]  time the cops premeditatedly knock somebody's teeth out, it's called a tussle. We'll be
[04:47.000 --> 04:54.440]  right back.
[04:54.440 --> 04:59.120]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime
[04:59.120 --> 05:04.680]  in the future? At Lays Med Inc., the future is here. Now it's cancer's turn to die with

[05:53.000 --> 06:01.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[06:01.000 --> 06:07.800]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[06:07.800 --> 06:13.200]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[06:13.200 --> 06:21.800]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first
[06:21.800 --> 06:27.200]  time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn
[06:27.200 --> 06:30.480]  the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[06:30.480 --> 06:33.280]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[06:33.280 --> 06:36.440]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[06:36.440 --> 06:38.600]  They're after power. Yes, they're after music.

[06:52.080 --> 06:56.320]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent? How about chlorides,
[06:56.320 --> 07:02.480]  dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more? Even fragrance can indicate the presence
[07:02.480 --> 07:07.760]  of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic. Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[07:07.760 --> 07:11.440]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[07:11.440 --> 07:15.920]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[07:15.920 --> 07:21.000]  and mucous membranes. Now compare a cowbell and pure soap. All natural, earth-friendly,

[07:54.080 --> 08:00.640]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[08:00.640 --> 08:22.520]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:22.520 --> 08:28.880]  In the last segment, I talked about another video coming out of police beating a woman
[08:28.880 --> 08:34.320]  up for asking questions politely, and the video's been released, and the news calls
[08:34.320 --> 08:40.360]  it a tussle. And time and time again, when the police assault you, that's the term that
[08:40.360 --> 08:47.040]  she used instead of saying paramilitary thugs brutally assault with deadly weapons, an innocent
[08:47.040 --> 08:53.400]  person for asking questions. Now it's always, oh, there was a tussle and the neck got broken
[08:53.400 --> 08:58.120]  or there was a tussle and he died of being, well, he was tasered, but we don't know if
[08:58.120 --> 09:03.560]  the taser killed him or her. Or, oh, she was handcuffed behind her back in solitary confinement
[09:03.560 --> 09:14.040]  at the airport, but she choked herself with the handcuffs. No. And it's even wrong to
[09:14.040 --> 09:20.480]  call, I guess, the TSA cops. I guess they're glorified federal security guards. No. They've
[09:20.480 --> 09:24.520]  never really, I guess, grew up getting in fights or haven't read any history or don't
[09:24.520 --> 09:28.360]  know anything about criminology. When you start piling on people and jumping on their
[09:28.360 --> 09:34.520]  heads, they start dying. See, and then you get to be big and macho and somebody gets
[09:34.520 --> 09:40.160]  to die. And then you kind of brag at the bar later about, man, I'm feeling pretty powerful.
[09:40.160 --> 09:46.000]  I just murdered somebody. They're like, darn killer. Don't mess with Bob. You see how you
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.040]  hear that crack when he jumped on his head? I mean, that's, that's what this country
[09:53.040 --> 09:57.680]  turned into. Don't feel bad. They'll murder you in England for asking questions. They'll
[09:57.680 --> 10:01.520]  murder you in Canada. You're tortured with taser in Canada. If you're caught on a bus
[10:01.520 --> 10:05.880]  or train without a ticket or can't get it out fast enough, the police chief, when he
[10:05.880 --> 10:13.520]  got criticized in one city, said, yeah, we punish you on the spot. You will be tortured.
[10:13.520 --> 10:18.680]  By the way, I saw in a message board story or in one of the postings in the article
[10:18.680 --> 10:24.960]  that Steve Watson wrote for infowars.net that was posted on infowars.com. You want to read
[10:24.960 --> 10:30.520]  the comment? And the guy said, I like this Alex Jones guy, but he goes a little far.
[10:30.520 --> 10:35.800]  Some of what he says is true, but the, the auxiliary police in England didn't didn't
[10:35.800 --> 10:42.320]  stand by while a kid drowned in the river. He's just making that up. We have mainstream
[10:42.320 --> 10:48.120]  news articles and the police defended it and said, our auxiliary officers are not trained
[10:48.120 --> 10:53.160]  in water rescue. And by the way, it was slow moving river just there on the side. They
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.640]  were just small children. One small child went in, the brother went in to save a small
[10:57.640 --> 11:02.880]  sister and got, went under and died and they shot their like complete cowards and then
[11:02.880 --> 11:09.400]  they got commended for not saving the child. So don't you tell me it's not true. Don't
[11:09.400 --> 11:15.120]  just sit there and go on my website and then, and then you hear me on the radio show talking
[11:15.120 --> 11:20.640]  about it and then you just decide that sounds unbelievable. So you just say it isn't true.
[11:20.640 --> 11:27.800]  I am tired of that. I got emails yesterday again saying quit lying about testing of chemical
[11:27.800 --> 11:33.120]  weapons on our troops. It never happened. That would be in the news. Well, listen, it
[11:33.120 --> 11:40.320]  was in the news. Ryan, whoever you are that sent me this email, it is all over the news.
[11:40.320 --> 11:45.440]  You just can't get your mind around it because it'd be scary. If you found out there was
[11:45.440 --> 11:52.520]  a shadow government that thousands of times murders US citizens, police and military poisons
[11:52.520 --> 12:00.920]  them millions of times and then covers it up, but that it would be admitted later. See,
[12:00.920 --> 12:05.760]  then you'd have to do something about that. You'd have to admit there was scary murderous
[12:05.760 --> 12:11.240]  people in control and that would scare you and you're a coward. And so the ultimate coward
[12:11.240 --> 12:20.120]  just lies to themselves and says it doesn't exist. You know, when I get up here and read
[12:20.120 --> 12:25.420]  all the cases of the family courts that aren't real courts with no due process, no evidence
[12:25.420 --> 12:32.600]  allowed to be entered, not even real courts, private agencies, seizing small children
[12:32.600 --> 12:37.720]  how they're five times more often killed, tortured, abused and how it's in every state
[12:37.720 --> 12:43.520]  and federal code that the CPS and that the courts cannot go after CPS workers. They are
[12:43.520 --> 12:49.480]  allowed to rape and murder and kill and they do. You're not going to believe that because
[12:49.480 --> 12:55.320]  you don't want to. You don't want to know that for 90 years, they've been federally
[12:55.320 --> 13:02.400]  chartered and given immunity since they were originally set up to carry out eugenics against
[13:02.400 --> 13:07.520]  those that didn't have good racial hygiene. You don't want to know all these horrors are
[13:07.520 --> 13:15.200]  going on all around you. That'd be too scary. It'd be too scary to know that millions of
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.680]  pedophiles have gone and joined the Child Protective Services and criminals have joined
[13:20.680 --> 13:26.120]  the Elder Services to steal money and grab assets and exercise power. It'd be too scary
[13:26.120 --> 13:30.800]  to learn that roid heads and gang members and thugs have filled the ranks of the military
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.000]  and convicted felons are now being hired by sheriff's departments everywhere. It'd be
[13:35.000 --> 13:46.320]  too much of a concern for you. It'd be too scary for you to admit to yourself. But nevertheless,
[13:46.320 --> 13:52.720]  that reality is there whether you face it or not, whether you admit to it and make preparations
[13:52.720 --> 14:00.160]  to face it or whether you decide to say it doesn't exist. A man with courage only dies
[14:00.160 --> 14:08.840]  a single death, you die a thousand deaths every single day. Okay, let's get into the
[14:08.840 --> 14:13.920]  news. Again, OPEC chief warms of unlimited oil prices of Iran attack, Bush's secret
[14:13.920 --> 14:20.960]  army of snoops and snitches, TSA versus passenger tussle caught on tape, new focus of lawsuit
[14:20.960 --> 14:25.840]  and you watch the video and the woman is just saying, why are you yelling at me? Why are
[14:25.840 --> 14:30.120]  you in my face? And so they just take her and slam her head on the ground, start stomping
[14:30.120 --> 14:34.240]  her. I mean, it'd be no different if I just walked up and mugged a woman. But see, if
[14:34.240 --> 14:37.840]  I walked up and grabbed one by the hair and slammed her head in the wall and stomped on
[14:37.840 --> 14:50.560]  her on the ground, I would get in trouble, but not some power hungry little troll. You
[14:50.560 --> 14:54.800]  know, I better watch myself every time I fly out of Austin. Doesn't matter which TSA person
[14:54.800 --> 15:01.280]  is, they say, Oh, Alex Jones, hmm, have a nice trip. And I know summer fans have run
[15:01.280 --> 15:05.240]  on, you know, run into them on the street. I don't know of the others, but every one
[15:05.240 --> 15:10.920]  of them, Oh, Alex Jones, I have a good trip. Alex, where are you going? Have fun. And they
[15:10.920 --> 15:17.160]  just kind of step back and I've even been in Canada and I've been in New York and I've
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.680]  been in LA and run into them who know me. Sometimes with that effect in LA, I got to
[15:21.680 --> 15:26.960]  be laughed at and called names and it was a celebration of evil and a celebration of
[15:26.960 --> 15:32.480]  tyranny and abuse and just sick. There are a lot of sick people want power and they know
[15:32.480 --> 15:37.960]  to get a uniform. But you can watch them beat the daylights out of this woman and then they
[15:37.960 --> 15:45.160]  call it a tussle. No, a tussle is when two people get into a light fight here. That's
[15:45.160 --> 15:54.000]  that's a tussle. I would say I would guess the Oxford dictionary would be a fight that
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.160]  doesn't get too extreme or a fight that doesn't cause serious injuries. Here, let's go to
[15:59.160 --> 16:09.360]  Google and let's type in tussle. Let's get the definition tussle. Sometimes my internet
[16:09.360 --> 16:25.160]  connection gets a bit slow t u s s l e tussle. Let's look at the definition of tussle. I
[16:25.160 --> 16:36.480]  am on the dictionary dot com and let's look at it to fight or to struggle energetically.
[16:36.480 --> 16:46.880]  Evil English tussle to pull the act of fighting any consent or contest or struggle. A fight
[16:46.880 --> 16:52.440]  broke up by a hockey game. There was fighting in the streets. The unhappy couple got into
[16:52.440 --> 16:58.200]  a terrible scrap. I think of the common use of it as a lighter fight, but I guess this
[16:58.200 --> 17:03.680]  associated with sports, but I fighting or a struggle in a confused way at close quarters.
[17:03.680 --> 17:10.360]  The drunken man that started to scuffle. This is a fight. This is two people hitting
[17:10.360 --> 17:20.720]  each other. It's what it says here. Next time, I guess even if you want to assault somebody,
[17:20.720 --> 17:24.720]  just beat the daylights out of them in the cop shop and say, what, I was just tussling.
[17:24.720 --> 17:32.800]  TSA versus passenger tussle caught on tape versus passenger. See, not just tussle, but
[17:32.800 --> 17:37.920]  versus like it was a fight, a prize fight, like they were both on equal ground. Now
[17:37.920 --> 17:44.480]  there was a bunch of men beating the hell out of a woman for no reason, legitimized by
[17:44.480 --> 17:55.320]  the supine prostitute willing accomplices in the media. They say she was obstructing
[17:55.320 --> 18:00.480]  justice by arguing with them and so they beat the hell out of her. Go read what they have
[18:00.480 --> 18:07.880]  to say. Go read them defending beating a woman up to a pulp. She's lucky she didn't hang
[18:07.880 --> 18:13.120]  herself in her cell because it's about them showing you who's boss. It's about their little
[18:13.120 --> 18:16.880]  ego while they're drinking sodium fluoride when they're shooting their kids up and watching
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.400]  them have seizures and going to convulsions for mercury. It's about them dying of cancer.
[18:21.400 --> 18:25.560]  It's about their families dying young. It's about being losers. It's about being lied
[18:25.560 --> 18:29.960]  to. It's about having credit card debt. It's about living in a hovel, shoving other people
[18:29.960 --> 18:35.160]  around. It's about being losers. That's what America's about and that's what they want.
[18:35.160 --> 18:39.520]  They want lies and they want fraud and they carry out lies and fraud every day and it's
[18:39.520 --> 18:43.920]  carried out against them and they love it. They love the fact that the government hurts
[18:43.920 --> 18:51.440]  them and abuses them and lies to them because they're spiritually dark and wicked. What
[18:51.440 --> 18:54.880]  else do you call it? I mean you can say, oh the team had great spirit. Don't believe
[18:54.880 --> 19:02.840]  in it. I'm saying the aura, the idea, the mindset is a nation begging to be plundered
[19:02.840 --> 19:12.480]  and don't worry, the new order will give you everything you want in spades. You like $145,
[19:12.480 --> 19:17.920]  $147 a barrel. How about $200 a barrel oil? How about eight bucks at the pump? Because
[19:17.920 --> 19:22.560]  they know there's nothing you won't take. They know you're there. You're there to be
[19:22.560 --> 19:26.800]  pushed around. You're there to grovel. The troops are there to be nerve gas and flop
[19:26.800 --> 19:32.520]  around dying. Nothing there. The government, well the government murders them with pleasure.
[19:32.520 --> 19:36.280]  The government's here to ship the heroin and cocaine in and then swat team your kids
[19:36.280 --> 19:41.400]  if they're dumb enough to use it. Big sick joke. It's all about corruption, all about
[19:41.400 --> 19:53.240]  abortion, all about corrupt prisons, all about evil. You want evil? You got it. May I have
[19:53.240 --> 19:59.440]  everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside
[19:59.440 --> 20:02.880]  job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the new world order?
[20:02.880 --> 20:07.520]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? It was engineered by you, David
[20:07.520 --> 20:14.520]  Rockefeller, that's for a lateral commission to see for. David, we stop asking questions
[20:14.520 --> 20:20.080]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years
[20:20.080 --> 20:27.880]  after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job.
[20:27.880 --> 20:34.480]  How dare you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for
[20:34.480 --> 20:38.920]  the treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government
[20:38.920 --> 20:43.760]  has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.
[20:43.760 --> 20:49.840]  Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[20:49.840 --> 20:54.560]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level. Hi, this is Alex Jones and I want
[20:54.560 --> 20:59.320]  to talk to you about the high price of gasoline. It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor
[20:59.320 --> 21:02.840]  even though we're paying record prices at the pump. I have run across a company called
[21:02.840 --> 21:07.960]  SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage. Instead of paying a mechanic
[21:07.960 --> 21:13.080]  as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete fuel system treatment cleans
[21:13.080 --> 21:18.880]  to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage and only one tank full. Protect an engine
[21:18.880 --> 21:23.400]  treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine. Let's face
[21:23.400 --> 21:27.440]  it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action. Purchase a protective
[21:27.440 --> 21:33.280]  fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95
[21:33.280 --> 21:40.560]  value free. Call triple eight, use SFR 1. That number again is triple eight, use SFR 1 or
[21:40.560 --> 21:46.880]  check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com. That's oilcompanysecret.com. Satisfaction

[23:57.400 --> 24:02.040]  You hear that guitar? That's in tune. I think Genesis is the place where anybody who has
[24:02.040 --> 24:08.680]  an untuned guitar cuts these ads. The guy with the untold story needs to tune his guitar
[24:08.680 --> 24:17.280]  and so does the hempusa guy. I mean, it's like a joke. I mean, I can't help it anymore.
[24:17.280 --> 24:27.120]  I mean, hell, bring me a guitar in here. I can't even play it. The torturer's welding
[24:27.120 --> 24:31.920]  in there because he's a pretty good guitar player, not his own band. Torturer's me, too.
[24:31.920 --> 24:40.280]  I'm just joking, folks. It really does disrespect the show, though. It does. There's no standards.
[24:40.280 --> 24:49.000]  God help us. I'm out of control. I realize that. Just listen a little bit of this song.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.600]  I scream and yell at people. It's because I'm upset, folks. We've got hardcore croaks
[24:52.600 --> 24:57.520]  running things. Our whole society's going into deep tyranny and tyranny isn't cute,
[24:57.520 --> 25:02.400]  much. Millions of dead bodies and piles of rotten bodies and men in black steam ash
[25:02.400 --> 25:07.560]  dancing around isn't fun. So just go ahead and listen to this. This is for you, CIA,
[25:07.560 --> 25:12.480]  FBI, Secret Service, who's over here every week. Just listen to it.
[25:12.480 --> 25:28.480]  It ain't me, though. I ain't no millionaire, son. It ain't me, though. I ain't the fortunate one.
[25:28.480 --> 25:44.960]  Some folks are numb, and here it starts playing the lies. I don't need to send you off to war.
[25:44.960 --> 25:54.840]  They say more! More! More! More! Give me five tours! I want you to breathe near you and
[25:54.840 --> 26:00.520]  take deadly shots. We're going to spray nerve gas on you. I want you to die. I'm your government.
[26:00.520 --> 26:07.640]  I love you. Serve me. There's nothing you schmucks won't give me. I'm the new world order,
[26:07.640 --> 26:10.640]  and I drink of your substance. I drink it out.
[26:10.640 --> 26:38.640]  FBI. CIA. Secret Service. Secret Service. I ain't the fortunate one. No, no, no, no. FBI. CIA.
[26:38.640 --> 26:50.000]  Stop shipping the drugs into our kids. Secret Service. Get off our backs. I ain't the fortunate one.
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.440]  Stop pushing and pushing and pushing. Your masters have got you in a trap. You can't even
[26:57.440 --> 27:10.560]  figure it out. They plan on us killing each other instead of uniting against the new world order.
[27:10.560 --> 27:16.720]  Yeah, this is Real Talk Radio, ladies and gentlemen. I had some twit last week in
[27:16.720 --> 27:22.640]  me an email going, that's the name of somebody else's show. No, that person absconded with my name.
[27:22.640 --> 27:28.080]  I have 10-year-old t-shirts with Real Talk Radio on it. That's the name of my radio show.
[27:29.760 --> 27:36.720]  A show dedicated to fighting the new world order. A radio show dedicated to not pulling
[27:36.720 --> 27:42.160]  punches and not mincing words and not holding back. I got to settle down. I got to stop getting mad.
[27:42.160 --> 27:47.440]  I just, I'm calm all day. I research this stuff all day. I study it. I learn more and more.
[27:47.440 --> 27:54.000]  I see what's happening in our society and then I get on air and I blow up. And I need to stop
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.600]  doing this. It's not good for me. Plus, I got a lot of stuff I want to cover. But I mean,
[27:57.600 --> 28:05.520]  you read this. OPEC chief warns of unlimited oil prices if Iran attacked. The head of the
[28:05.520 --> 28:10.880]  organization of petroleum exporting countries warned Thursday that oil prices would see an
[28:10.880 --> 28:15.200]  unlimited increase. In the case of military conflict involving Iran, because the group's
[28:15.200 --> 28:20.560]  members would be unable to make up the lost production. We already cannot replace Iran's
[28:20.560 --> 28:27.280]  production. It's not feasible to replace it. Abadala Salim Al-Bahari, the OPEC secretary
[28:27.280 --> 28:32.480]  general said in an interview, by the way, you go read that full press release, a new one put out
[28:32.480 --> 28:37.520]  last night by them. And it says the dollar is continuing to drop. Please shore it up.
[28:38.640 --> 28:44.560]  We are doing you a favor holding your dollars. Go read it. But you'll never see it in the media
[28:44.560 --> 28:48.880]  here because you can't let the slave cattle in their slaughter pens know.
[28:51.120 --> 28:55.440]  The stupid cows licking the hand of the black glove and the New World Order,
[28:55.440 --> 29:00.560]  loving those are going to be butchering them. Iran, the second largest production country
[29:00.560 --> 29:05.520]  in OPEC after Saudi Arabia produces about 4 million barrels of oil a day out of the daily
[29:05.520 --> 29:11.840]  worldwide production of close to 87 million barrels. The United States is using 20 million
[29:11.840 --> 29:16.720]  plus a day, by the way. The country has been locked in a lengthy dispute with Western nations
[29:16.720 --> 29:20.720]  over its nuclear ambitions. And recently the price of oil has risen higher on speculation
[29:20.720 --> 29:24.800]  that Israel could be preparing to mount an attack on the country's nuclear facilities.
[29:24.800 --> 29:31.040]  The saber rattling intensified this week with missile test by Iran. Come back, get into all the
[29:31.040 --> 29:44.480]  war news, the financial news, it's all completely linked and exquisitely merged. We're on the march,
[29:44.480 --> 29:49.840]  the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[30:52.560 --> 30:57.120]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints,
[30:57.120 --> 31:01.280]  lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet,
[31:01.280 --> 31:06.400]  but it just seems so difficult. Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from
[31:06.400 --> 31:13.120]  SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[31:13.120 --> 31:18.160]  Drinking water? No, that's something I can handle. The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain
[31:18.160 --> 31:22.400]  all of the different options and helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me. I used my new
[31:22.400 --> 31:27.120]  Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water,
[31:27.120 --> 31:33.840]  I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great.

[32:47.200 --> 32:51.360]  Do it now or become property of the New World Order.
[32:51.360 --> 33:06.640]  Stop heading downhill like a snowball headed for hell. I wish your butt was still silver.
[33:06.640 --> 33:23.760]  It was back when the country was wrong. Back before else and before the Vietnam War came along.
[33:23.760 --> 33:37.920]  Before the Beatles and yesterday. When a man could still work, still would.
[33:37.920 --> 33:55.600]  It's the best of the free life behind us now. And our good times really over for good.
[33:55.600 --> 34:12.000]  And I was rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell. But no kind of chance for the flag
[34:12.000 --> 34:25.840]  or the liberty fell. I wish your forehead and the Chevy would still last 10 years like the shoe.
[34:25.840 --> 34:41.120]  It's the best of the free life behind us now. And our good times really over for good.
[34:41.120 --> 34:57.600]  I wish coke was still cola in a joint. It was a bad place to be. And it was back before
[34:57.600 --> 35:13.520]  Nick's lighters all on TV. And for microwave ovens when a girl could still work, still would.
[35:13.520 --> 35:27.200]  It's the best of the free life behind us now. And our good times really over for good.
[35:31.760 --> 35:40.240]  I was rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell. I like the last line by Merle.
[35:40.240 --> 35:48.560]  Quit rolling downhill. Well, we got to stop it. And watching cops beat a woman up for no reason.
[35:49.920 --> 35:57.280]  And then say that she was tussling with them, insulting your intelligence.
[36:01.680 --> 36:04.560]  You know, you wish Ford's and Chevy's wouldn't fall apart. How about you wish they wouldn't
[36:04.560 --> 36:10.720]  go out of business or move to Mexico. See how it's getting worse and worse.
[36:13.280 --> 36:16.560]  I mean, Merle thought it was bad back in the 70s. This is nothing.
[36:19.360 --> 36:24.640]  Folks, the dollar is dying. They're going to use military conflict to cover that,
[36:24.640 --> 36:27.120]  either the threat of military conflict or conflict.
[36:27.120 --> 36:34.880]  Rice warns Iran, U.S. will defend Israel. French news agency, U.S. Secretary of State
[36:34.880 --> 36:40.480]  Connolly said Rice warned Iran on Thursday that Washington had beefed up its security presence
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.920]  in the Gulf and would not hesitate to defend Israel and other allies in the region.
[36:45.920 --> 36:51.440]  We will defend American interest and the interest of our allies. Rice said answering a question
[36:51.440 --> 36:56.560]  on an Iranian threat to set fire to Israel. Notice how even the French news spins that
[36:56.560 --> 37:00.720]  if you read the quote, they took two words out of it. They said, if you attack us,
[37:02.720 --> 37:09.520]  Israel will burn. If Israel attacks us, we will strike back with a Blitzkrieg attack,
[37:09.520 --> 37:15.360]  and they will burn. Doesn't matter. The average French person, the average Brit,
[37:15.360 --> 37:21.360]  the average American. Here's, man, Iran for no reason said they set fire to Israel.
[37:21.360 --> 37:27.520]  Meanwhile, every day, I have a stack of news here, mainstream news, where the White House,
[37:27.520 --> 37:33.440]  again, is running four different Sunni al-Qaeda groups in Iran with U.S. special forces
[37:34.320 --> 37:39.840]  commanding them. U.S. special forces for five years have been shooting and killing and bombing
[37:39.840 --> 37:45.840]  inside. They have real terrorists in Iran, and of course, it's the people from our nation.
[37:45.840 --> 37:53.840]  I mean, and Iran is suing the U.S. begging, please stop. Don't do this. Don't attack us with thousands
[37:53.840 --> 38:00.800]  of fighter bombers, flights by fighter bombers, thousands of flights. Iran sent an open letter
[38:00.800 --> 38:08.480]  to the United States to the Congress last night saying, listen, you're running terror attacks
[38:08.480 --> 38:13.120]  in our country. Please stop bombing our mosque. Please stop attacking our dams. Please stop shooting
[38:13.120 --> 38:19.200]  our police and military. Listen, your inspectors have been here. We don't have nukes. Everybody
[38:19.200 --> 38:23.600]  knows that besides Israel has them. Why aren't we allowed to have them even if we were, but we've
[38:23.600 --> 38:30.480]  submitted to you. You know, they had a moderate government that had the U.N. totally running
[38:30.480 --> 38:33.600]  them, which gives into the new world order, whether you like it or not. And that's why
[38:33.600 --> 38:37.920]  they put in a more extreme government, because the U.S. said, we're going to attack you. We're
[38:37.920 --> 38:41.200]  going to go ahead and still come after you, even though you've done everything we said. And they
[38:41.200 --> 38:46.160]  said, but that's not reasonable. The people running our country said, we've overthrown you
[38:46.160 --> 38:51.120]  several times. We put a government in the tortured more than 300,000 of you to death with Savak.
[38:51.920 --> 38:58.720]  Shut up. Shut up. You will submit and we will bomb you. And your kids will take the inoculations,
[38:58.720 --> 39:04.080]  we say, and you will let our central bank run you. Either you let us kill you that way or we'll
[39:04.080 --> 39:09.600]  kill you this way. You are going to die just like the Serbs, just like the Afghans, just like our
[39:09.600 --> 39:15.280]  people are being poisoned right now. You will lovingly lick the barrel of the gun and cram it
[39:15.280 --> 39:23.360]  in your mouth and beg us to pull the trigger. Do you understand, Scum? You will be slaves just
[39:23.360 --> 39:28.480]  like our Scum. You will learn to be ignorant morons. We will break your family up. We will
[39:28.480 --> 39:34.400]  kidnap your children with CPS and we will rape them like we do in Serbia now. You will be our
[39:34.400 --> 39:40.320]  slaves. We will make snuff films with your children. We are the demon force. We are the Satan force.
[39:46.640 --> 39:51.040]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, gold has exploded more than $15 today in opening.
[39:52.320 --> 39:56.720]  All the major gold news from CNBC to Bloomberg say this looks like the beginning of the run
[39:56.720 --> 40:05.280]  up into the thousands. I don't know. I just know the dollar is plunging. I've got it all
[40:05.280 --> 40:10.320]  right here. Just the news is all too insane. Congress passes warrantless wiretapping. No
[40:10.320 --> 40:16.800]  Fourth Amendment. I want to bring Tim Larson up who's up in the Genesis Studios and Ted who is
[40:17.680 --> 40:21.120]  outside the office right now. Ted Anderson, owner of Genesis and Minus Resources, the parent
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.200]  company. I guess they're interlocked together. One is at the parent of the other. They're twins,
[40:25.200 --> 40:34.480]  but you can say Midas gave birth to Genesis. I guess parent is the proper term. Tim Larson
[40:34.480 --> 40:40.080]  there for more than a decade. He is, of course, their chief metals analyst. Writes a lot about
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.080]  that. Great info. We've got him both up for the next 10 minutes on the economy. I'm going to take
[40:44.080 --> 40:47.840]  your calls and Dr. Doug Rocky is going to be joining us about the troops dying at the Pliny
[40:47.840 --> 40:53.760]  Uranium. He wrote the book on it, so I want everybody to hear this. Let's go ahead and go to
[40:53.760 --> 40:59.760]  Tim Larson. Tim, gold is up. Last time I checked up 15 bucks. Where is it right now?
[41:00.560 --> 41:06.080]  Last I looked it was up about 13 and silver is up another almost 20 cents again.
[41:07.360 --> 41:11.600]  You know, it's just with what's going on with the credit markets out there. You can't keep it
[41:11.600 --> 41:17.360]  down. They can try and manipulate it as much as possible during the summer months, but it's just
[41:17.360 --> 41:24.560]  not happening. For those that don't know, the summer months are normally the downtime,
[41:25.680 --> 41:33.200]  but now we've never seen it up like this in the summer. Let's bring Ted Anderson in. Ted,
[41:33.200 --> 41:38.880]  what do you think is going to happen here? I can tell you right now, Alex, I'm sitting here in
[41:38.880 --> 41:44.400]  Central America and people are South American. People are trying to get away from the dollar here.
[41:44.400 --> 41:50.640]  They're no longer accepting the dollar and a lot of the transactions. It used to be that these
[41:50.640 --> 41:56.560]  countries were hurting and they wanted to turn to the dollar. Right now, they won't even,
[41:57.360 --> 42:04.160]  for many of the transactions, they wouldn't even take it. The United States dollar being a reserve
[42:05.520 --> 42:10.480]  world currency has really come to an end. That means that the United States debt
[42:10.480 --> 42:15.520]  is going to continue to grow. We have to continue to finance it through the Federal Reserve system.
[42:16.480 --> 42:18.880]  So it's bad news. It's bad news for the US economy.
[42:19.680 --> 42:22.320]  That's right, Ted. You're down in Buenos Aires right now,
[42:22.880 --> 42:26.160]  and that's why I wanted to get you on. They are running from the dollar there.
[42:27.120 --> 42:33.040]  New York City, Chicago, LA are now advertising they take euros. They want euros.
[42:33.040 --> 42:42.080]  Well, and the Argentine peso, that currency alone, I mean, it's just obviously we've seen
[42:42.080 --> 42:47.840]  the destruction down here. I mean, the inflation is just ridiculous, but now they're looking at
[42:47.840 --> 42:54.480]  the United States dollar having the same problems. The United States dollar is losing that attraction
[42:54.480 --> 43:01.440]  by the world, and that's what's going to cost. The United States has been living on this
[43:01.440 --> 43:09.200]  20, 30-year extended period of time where we could deficit spend and then just sell our US
[43:09.200 --> 43:14.480]  government securities to foreign nations. And we're not doing that now. The United States
[43:14.480 --> 43:19.600]  government is turning to printing money to solve the problem rather than selling it to foreigners.
[43:19.600 --> 43:24.000]  And rather than having earned money coming into the system, the money is being dumped into the
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.520]  system, and commodities are going up. Gas prices and oil prices are going up here as well. So
[43:29.520 --> 43:34.800]  you know, there's no question about it, Alex. Right now at this time, the United States dollar is
[43:34.800 --> 43:44.560]  in big trouble. Well, you're absolutely right. Tim Larson, how fast do you see the bottom
[43:44.560 --> 43:49.840]  falling out of this? Well, it's falling off awfully quickly. I mean, let's look at the credit
[43:49.840 --> 43:56.240]  markets right now. I mean, they're in shambles. You've got just the S&P in itself. There's
[43:56.240 --> 44:06.640]  85 financial components in the S&P, and they've lost $1.4 trillion since last October. And that's
[44:06.640 --> 44:14.800]  all by itself. You've got shares of Fannie Mae, then Freddie Mac that lost over 20% on Monday
[44:14.800 --> 44:23.840]  itself. Now, yesterday, Fannie Mae was down 13%. Freddie Mac was down 23%. I mean, over the past
[44:23.840 --> 44:31.760]  12 months, they're both down almost 90%. And this is all money that's coming from bad loans.
[44:31.760 --> 44:36.480]  And it's not going to stop. So now the government still has to print that money
[44:37.360 --> 44:42.320]  to finance all of this. Now there's talk that the government's going to try and bail out Freddie
[44:42.320 --> 44:46.880]  and Fannie. Well, it's not going to happen. And that means further devaluation, only putting off
[44:46.880 --> 44:52.320]  the inevitable, while devaluing the currency, driving up prices as oil and every other commodity
[44:52.320 --> 44:57.840]  from corn to gold, skyrockets. Ted, specifically, you're down there in Argentina. You're down there
[44:57.840 --> 45:02.960]  in South America, right by Brazil. And that's what I'm seeing in the news is that they're
[45:02.960 --> 45:08.720]  running from the dollar, which was absolute king there forever, the last 100 years. How are they
[45:08.720 --> 45:13.520]  behaving? What are they doing? What are they saying when you talk to them? What are they saying when
[45:13.520 --> 45:18.880]  you try to pay for things with it? Well, that's the thing. I mean, half of the transactions,
[45:18.880 --> 45:24.240]  they'll still take US currency and many of the transactions. But now, as it changed things,
[45:24.240 --> 45:28.800]  some of the transactions are no longer being accepted in US dollar. You have to go to the
[45:30.000 --> 45:36.320]  Argentine peso, which that currency is just toilet paper. And the United States dollars
[45:36.320 --> 45:41.040]  taken on that same position. Obviously, the euro is gaining a lot of strength while the
[45:41.040 --> 45:45.920]  dollar is losing a lot. But like Tim was saying, every time we have an economic problem,
[45:45.920 --> 45:49.840]  the United States government is turning to try to solve the problem by turning the Federal
[45:49.840 --> 45:56.800]  Reserve system. And we have this unconstitutional paper system. People call it the US dollar.
[45:56.800 --> 46:03.440]  It's not the US dollar. It's Citibank's dollar. It's Chase Manhattan's dollar. It's Wells Fargo.
[46:03.440 --> 46:11.200]  It's this private cartel of bankers that basically set up a system that put us into perpetual debt.
[46:11.200 --> 46:16.240]  And now we're seeing the consequences of it. And it's compounding. It's getting worse.
[46:16.240 --> 46:21.280]  And it's getting worse fast. And the United States cannot get off on this credit binge.
[46:21.280 --> 46:25.920]  We keep on turning to our politicians to solve our problems. And they keep turning
[46:25.920 --> 46:30.720]  the Federal Reserve to print money to do it. Well, when Tim gets back from his trip with his
[46:30.720 --> 46:36.880]  fiance to Argentina, I want to have you in studio next week to really break down what's happening
[46:36.880 --> 46:43.200]  with the dollar when you were down in South America. But getting back to what's happening
[46:43.200 --> 46:48.160]  with gold right now, again, dead time of the year, always in the middle of summer, normally the
[46:48.160 --> 46:55.200]  doldrums, flat as a pancake, or going down in history, skyrocketing right now. And now all
[46:55.200 --> 47:01.680]  the majors are talking about gold exploding even further. Ted, you've got gold again,
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.080]  locked in at what it was a week ago, lower than it is now. I don't know how long you
[47:06.080 --> 47:11.920]  can hold with this, but people need to call Tim Larson at Midas Resources in the same building
[47:11.920 --> 47:17.360]  as Genesis right now, because you can get semi-animismatic coins at very near melt for
[47:17.360 --> 47:21.120]  bullion prices. That's a deal you can't beat. What's the offer today, Ted?
[47:22.320 --> 47:27.200]  Yeah, currently, right now, we have gold. I locked in at $9.26 an ounce. So right now,
[47:27.200 --> 47:33.440]  I'm looking at gold at $9.48. The silver's at $18.34. $17 silver I have in here, too.
[47:33.440 --> 47:37.760]  I'm selling those walking Liberty hats for the same price I was last time I was on the
[47:37.760 --> 47:43.840]  air with you there at $189.20. That's a great buy on the silver. And we also have the British
[47:43.840 --> 47:53.040]  sovereign at $257. And we have the French Swiss franc, Belgium franc, is a mixture of European
[47:53.040 --> 47:59.040]  countries that make the franc coin, and they're at $205. Again, this stuff is priced at the level
[47:59.040 --> 48:06.720]  when gold was sitting down at $926. I mean, if you take a look at that French franc, I mean,
[48:06.720 --> 48:11.760]  it's practically right at spot. So is that British sovereign. Those rolls of silver halves are, you
[48:11.760 --> 48:16.240]  know, just a short time ago, I couldn't even get rolls of silver halves, silver dollars,
[48:16.240 --> 48:20.240]  and all these different things. Silver was basically gone. It was done. I know we're
[48:20.240 --> 48:24.480]  heading toward this fall and it's coming up fast. And usually it's, usually it's August
[48:24.480 --> 48:29.120]  that things start picking up, but we're sitting here in July, which is typically a slow month,
[48:29.120 --> 48:35.040]  and it is going hot. It's hot as a pistol right now. You're always careful, and you really go
[48:35.040 --> 48:38.800]  conservative with your statements. I want to ask you, and then Tim Larson at Midas,
[48:40.240 --> 48:44.400]  do you think gold is going to crest above a thousand by September?
[48:46.960 --> 48:52.640]  Yeah, I'll go ahead and add my two cents in. I would say October. We're going to get over
[48:52.640 --> 48:57.680]  gold at a thousand dollars an ounce by October. And I'm being conservative about that. I would not
[48:57.680 --> 49:02.400]  be surprised at all if we have a thousand dollars an ounce gold, even by the end of August. And
[49:02.400 --> 49:07.120]  that's just because watching what had happened last year, and it's all about the speculators.
[49:07.120 --> 49:11.360]  What are they going to be coming in? How much are they going to be buying? How tight are the
[49:11.360 --> 49:16.720]  supplies of gold and silver? And how far will be, you know, pushed up? But let's be clear,
[49:16.720 --> 49:22.480]  let's be clear for the last couple of years. We have had the IMF and World Bank dumping hundreds
[49:22.480 --> 49:27.600]  of billions of gold in the market at underpriced, trying to drive it down. And Tim, they're out
[49:27.600 --> 49:32.240]  of bullets, just like they're out of bullets with cutting interest rates. They can't suppress the
[49:32.240 --> 49:40.480]  price of gold anymore. Do you agree with that statement, Tim? Most definitely. I mean, it was
[49:40.480 --> 49:47.840]  back like in the 1999, when the Bank of England said they were going to dump 410 tons of gold
[49:47.840 --> 49:52.560]  onto the market. Well, they never did that. I mean, basically, they make a statement like that.
[49:52.560 --> 49:58.000]  First of all, it disgraces gold because the central bank is no longer using it as a monetary
[49:58.000 --> 50:04.240]  instrument. And they think 410 tons is going to flood the market. So gold dropped, oh, I'd say it
[50:04.240 --> 50:11.600]  would drop $45 in three days. And that was back when it was at about 260. Now, last year, you had
[50:11.600 --> 50:16.400]  the Bundesbank say they were going to dump 600 tons onto the market. Well, they don't even have 600
[50:16.400 --> 50:22.240]  tons. But gold dropped about 8 bucks in one day and it was back up 12 the next day. The tricks
[50:22.240 --> 50:29.840]  they're using aren't working any longer. Final segment with both of you, Ted Anderson from
[50:29.840 --> 50:36.240]  Buenos Aires, Argentina, down there at the bottom of the world, close to Antarctica. I'd love to
[50:36.240 --> 50:42.320]  be able to travel. Ted's never been there. He's there now, though. I'd love to go down there myself.
[50:42.320 --> 50:48.080]  I've seen some travel video down there. It's so gorgeous. Tim Larson, Ted Anderson will come back
[50:48.080 --> 50:55.040]  and wrap up our discussion of what's happening with the economy. On September 11th, 2001,
[50:55.040 --> 51:01.040]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do. Or at least
[51:01.040 --> 51:06.560]  we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a
[51:06.560 --> 51:16.720]  platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was
[51:16.720 --> 51:22.160]  safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout
[51:22.160 --> 51:27.200]  the world take action against their global masters. He had his hand over the radio while he was
[51:27.200 --> 51:32.800]  getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom,
[51:32.800 --> 51:40.880]  boom, boom. This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[51:40.880 --> 51:46.960]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the
[51:46.960 --> 51:51.040]  government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[51:51.040 --> 52:05.760]  Another untold story here it come. Another untold story here it come. Another untold story that
[52:05.760 --> 52:17.520]  you have not been told from another untoldstory.com. This is not so much of another untold story as
[52:17.520 --> 52:23.520]  it is about another untold candidate, presidential candidate that you are not being told about,
[52:24.240 --> 52:30.080]  and about the grassroots movement of millions that are backing this candidate whose name
[52:30.080 --> 52:36.560]  someone doesn't want you to hear or repeat. It's someone no existing candidate dare say is not
[52:36.560 --> 52:42.560]  a far better presidential candidate than they. They know they can't say that, so they simply say
[52:42.560 --> 52:49.680]  nothing at all about him. You see, you are not to know about him or how you can vote for him.
[52:49.680 --> 52:56.800]  Who is he? Well, go to the website, anotheruntoldstory.com and find out. And when you do,
[52:56.800 --> 53:03.520]  you will find out the untold story of what a money racket the whole election process has become.
[53:04.480 --> 53:10.080]  Most think there is no one to vote for, but they will think differently if they go to another
[53:10.080 --> 53:18.400]  untoldstory.com and learn of the candidate no one tells them of. That's anotheruntoldstory.com.
[53:18.400 --> 53:24.800]  We tell you there. And when you go there, you'll learn not only how you can vote for him, but
[53:24.800 --> 53:48.800]  actually campaign for him as well. Anotheruntoldstory.com.
[54:10.240 --> 54:13.600]  Look, I can jump up and down, pull my hair out, stand on my head.
[54:16.160 --> 54:20.480]  If you don't get into precious metals and physically hold them and at least convert
[54:20.480 --> 54:25.520]  some of your Federal Reserve notes, some of your stocks and bonds. I mean, gold has
[54:26.480 --> 54:35.920]  tripled in price the last five years. It's close to quadrupled from what, 260 something
[54:35.920 --> 54:42.960]  dollars an ounce that it's low. And you've got the stock market all inflated, but it's even down.
[54:42.960 --> 54:49.920]  Though people are buying stocks with inflated dollars, we are sitting on top a powder keg
[54:49.920 --> 54:55.600]  that basically the Great Depression was one stick of dynamite. We're sitting on an entire
[54:55.600 --> 55:01.520]  warehouse of dynamite. Every indicator, every societal input, everything you put into the
[55:01.520 --> 55:09.840]  equation, it is dire straits. And I hate the new world order. I love having people not put their
[55:09.840 --> 55:14.480]  kids in government training camps. I love people stop drinking fluoride. I love to get people to
[55:14.480 --> 55:19.040]  buy firearms and learn how to use them. I love to expose the corrupt government. And I also love
[55:19.040 --> 55:23.200]  to put gold and silver in your hands. And I love to bring you great offers like the one Ted's
[55:23.920 --> 55:28.160]  bringing you here. This is a great deal. Ted, I think it's about three, four percent on these
[55:28.160 --> 55:32.720]  coins, just enough to pay his brokers. These are loss leaders, you know, things to get you
[55:32.720 --> 55:38.000]  introduced to precious metals. And so take and send you out a newsletter. Just just just give
[55:38.000 --> 55:48.720]  Ted a call at 1-800-686-2237, 1-800-686-2237. And they've got about what about a week turnaround
[55:48.720 --> 55:52.560]  shipping you this stuff out? A lot of places don't have this in their holdings. They just
[55:52.560 --> 55:58.160]  take your order and then get it. Ted has it in stock, the offers he's making to you today.
[55:58.160 --> 56:07.760]  1-800-686-2237. In closing, Tim Larson, with everything you've seen, do you think we're going
[56:07.760 --> 56:11.200]  to be able to avert a depression or do you think we're just going to go all the way into it?
[56:11.200 --> 56:15.760]  No, we're going to go straight into a global depression. As a matter of fact, I mean the BIS
[56:15.760 --> 56:21.200]  has been, has been warning people about that since the middle of last year, for God's sakes.
[56:21.840 --> 56:26.400]  And we've got the plunge protection team right now with the financial markets the way they are.
[56:26.400 --> 56:32.000]  You got the plunge protection team having to put in money constantly. Every day you've got the
[56:32.000 --> 56:37.440]  dollars, lost 40 percent of its value in the last three and a half years. People in the stock market
[56:37.440 --> 56:42.480]  right now, they're not gaining on that. They're losing money. You're going backwards because
[56:42.480 --> 56:47.760]  you've got inflation at 13, 14 percent a year right now. But we're a nation of denial and so
[56:47.760 --> 56:51.840]  people don't want to believe it. Basically, we're like a rowboat in the ocean and there's a hole in
[56:51.840 --> 57:01.040]  the boat and people are, you know, the Federal Reserve is basically dumping more money into
[57:01.040 --> 57:05.440]  the boat but that's water out of the same ocean. It's really just going to sink us that much
[57:05.440 --> 57:12.160]  faster. I mean this is, this is just unbelievable. And Tim, do you run into anybody in Minnesota
[57:12.160 --> 57:17.280]  that knows the dollars devalued because I can't find anybody that understands the most elementary
[57:17.280 --> 57:21.760]  reason all this is happening? I do every now and again, Ben, but you know, I started with a simple
[57:21.760 --> 57:26.880]  question. I asked these people, what do you think inflation is per year? And they look at what they
[57:26.880 --> 57:33.120]  buy and they look at everything what they buy. They look at electronics and vehicles. Well,
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.600]  nobody's selling vehicles. They can't go up in price. Electronics, they're coming down in price
[57:37.600 --> 57:43.120]  because they're all coming from China. Now you've got all the things you have to have to live off
[57:43.120 --> 57:49.760]  of. You've got food, energy, insurance costs, you name it. All of that is skyrocketing. Now you can
[57:49.760 --> 57:54.480]  give people a challenge and say go through your checkbook three years ago and write down everything
[57:54.480 --> 58:00.000]  you paid for you had to have to live. Now do it from last year and they're going to see that inflation.
[58:01.280 --> 58:06.800]  They're going to see 20, 30, 40 percent of their looking at fuel. Exactly. I mean we've seen a
[58:06.800 --> 58:13.280]  doubling the last year and I haven't a doubling before that. 1-800-686-2237. Ted, give them those
[58:13.280 --> 58:19.840]  coins again. Tell them the coin offers. Again, it's the it's the walking liberty half. They come
[58:19.840 --> 58:27.840]  in rolls of 20. They're at 189-20. With a British sovereign coin, it's $257. The Frank coin, this
[58:27.840 --> 58:31.520]  one's an easy one to do the math on. It's 205. Stay there. One minute. We'll be back.

[59:41.360 --> 59:57.360]  to Big Brother. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Government
[59:57.360 --> 1:00:06.320]  cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now,
[1:00:06.320 --> 1:00:13.600]  live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. The head of OPEC in the Associated Press says,
[1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:19.120]  if something happens here, nobody will be able to solve it, referring to war involving Iran.
[1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:26.560]  He said oil could go to an unlimited level, thousands and thousands of dollars per barrel.
[1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:32.160]  And notice our government, using environmentalists as their front, won't let you have the oil out
[1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:37.600]  of the Gulf out of Alaska. They're giving out limited permits in the Gulf. We are swimming
[1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:43.840]  in oil, but they have artificially suppressed it. And now they are raking us over the coals in the
[1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:51.360]  perfect storm. Can't get more oil, devaluing the dollar. And it is now completely unraveling our
[1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:56.560]  economy. And the world is holding dollars. It's a time bomb in the hold of all of their
[1:00:56.560 --> 1:01:06.880]  ships of state, seeing countries as floating economic communities upon the world's ocean of
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:12.240]  trade. And in the belly of all their ships, they have a huge time bomb sticking called the dollar.
[1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:17.840]  China's begging, India's begging, Europe's begging, OPEC's begging saying, press releases,
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:22.720]  please show up your dollar, raise interest rates, help us, it's going to destroy you,
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:28.720]  don't do it, tell your people you're destroying it. Meanwhile, the American people smiling,
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:34.000]  have no idea what's going on, stumbling around talking about speculators. Yeah,
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:40.320]  maybe 25% of the oil increase is speculation, but that's because everybody's running dumping their
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:44.880]  dollars. All the institutional wealth, the millionaires, the billionaires, anyone who knows
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:51.360]  how the world works, who doesn't watch, you know, shows like American Idol and baseball and football,
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:55.360]  people who are really into reality, they're all freaking out, fleeing the country years ago.
[1:01:56.800 --> 1:02:02.800]  And I'm not trying to scare you folks, this is the facts. Our government is run by Crooks
[1:02:02.800 --> 1:02:07.920]  that are forcibly bringing us into World War Three. They want to bring the world down in a
[1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:11.840]  world crisis, just like the engineered World War One and World War Two, Carol Quigley,
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:17.680]  Bill Clinton's mentor said, to bring in world government. And those two got them two steps
[1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:23.280]  of the way. The final step is now being implemented. Order out of chaos is their motto.
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:28.640]  I want to go back to that offer one more time, but Tim Larson, analyzing this for decades,
[1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:33.680]  working at Midas for 10 years, chief metals analyst, Ted said he thinks it'll go above
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:39.440]  a thousand. That's very conservative folks. That's sure thing. By October,
[1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:44.320]  where do you think sure thing gold is going to go? I mean, in your gut, I know you can't say
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:47.680]  officially, you don't have a crystal ball, but I mean, where do you see it going? I mean,
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:52.880]  Bloomberg saying 5,000, I don't believe that. I see seven, eight thousand, but that's after
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:58.720]  the bank's failed. But I'm seeing probably a thousand dollars by the end of maybe August.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  When does the Titanic break in two? I mean, when does it go fully under the water?
[1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:09.440]  Well, like I say, as soon as these countries do not want dollar denominated and assets any
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:13.120]  longer, they don't want to buy our debt any longer. Let's be clear, they begged and begged
[1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:17.920]  for us to share it up. We didn't, but overnight, I'd say the last six months, they said, okay,
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:22.320]  dump it, dump it, okay, you want it, we're getting out of it. Do you agree with that analysis, Tim?
[1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:26.960]  No, most definitely. I see that happening on a constant basis, and they don't want it. And,
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:32.560]  you know, like I say, there's going to be panic selling in our debt instruments, which is urban
[1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:37.280]  bonds and treasuries, et cetera, et cetera. It'll create panic selling. It'll collapse the banking
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:41.920]  system because the money's not there. And that's why they're gearing up for martial law, and they'll
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:46.880]  give you a terror attack to emotionally make you think that they're the good guys while they rape
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:54.320]  you. Ted, give out that last offer, that last gold coin again. Again, it's the Frank, it's at 205.
[1:03:54.320 --> 1:04:00.000]  If you think about it right now, gold's at 950, and you multiply this one by four, you get a,
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:07.280]  this coin is at 205 right now, and you multiply that by five, and that gets it to $1,000. It's
[1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:13.200]  only $50 above spot. I mean, that's just a fabulous buying gold, and it's small. I don't know why
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:17.040]  anybody would want to stay in the paper currencies. It's crazy. I think people...
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:21.120]  Well, it's an easy coin to get in at 205. You get a fifth of an ounce of gold or get the British
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:27.840]  Quarter ounces. Can't beat it. I mean, that really is the coin right there. 1-800-686-2237.
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:33.120]  Hey, Ted, it's a win-win situation. We're throwing them a life raft, helps us out a little bit,
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:37.040]  keeps the network going. I mean, if they won't take a life raft when the Titanic's going under
[1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:43.680]  the North Atlantic, I don't know. 800-686-2237. Tim Larson, Ted Anderson, thanks for talking to us.
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:47.440]  Thanks, Ellerson. We'll be right back with Dr. Doug Rocky. Ted, thank you.

[1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:58.240]  a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being
[1:05:58.240 --> 1:06:02.320]  a puppet from the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage,
[1:06:02.320 --> 1:06:06.480]  was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:20.560]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:30.000]  An inside job? How dare you? If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.640]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:39.760]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:45.040]  of 9-11. Please rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at

[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:57.200]  don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:02.320]  American families. Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:08.720]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide. The only solution is to use now

[1:07:41.600 --> 1:08:11.520]  piece of America is up to you. Call 800-409-5633. On Tuesday I played a TV club
[1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:19.200]  out of Australia mainstream news where in the 60s the United States government
[1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:29.120]  offering IMF and World Bank funds and loans and military assistance to Australia said if you
[1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:36.800]  want this assistance we want you to start off by spring sarin and vx nerve gas on 200 troops.
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:43.360]  We want you to kill them. Now they've done this in the U.S. they've done this in England. They had
[1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:47.120]  thousands of tests. Some cases they'd have gas mask on them. Some cases they'd have them
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:53.680]  faulty gas mask. Other cases no gas mask. Other cases they'd have a cloth mask to see what would
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:57.760]  happen and they'd never tell the troops what it was for. They'd say oh you're going to get three
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:04.800]  days to leave if you sign this form. We're just testing a flu bug or a cold bug. You might get
[1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:08.000]  sick but it's for your country and these guys thought their countries were good. They'd say okay
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:12.080]  and sign it. Now in other cases U.S. troops didn't even sign waivers. They just did it.
[1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:19.600]  U.S. citizens in the subways in the 60s 68 in the 70s being sprayed. Citizens died. They'd have
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:24.320]  army doctors posing as regular doctors at nearby hospitals to help cover up what was happening
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:30.400]  but also get readings on what the in that one case the unclassified they just report people died.
[1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:35.680]  Biological agent released from light bulbs fake light bulbs that released a mist. They looked
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:42.560]  like light bulbs. You know releasing repeated bio weapons hundreds of times or their favorite
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:50.960]  places is the San Francisco ship channel. They love releasing it there 45 46 50 70s 80s.
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:57.360]  Again they had a bio weapons test and chemical weapons test. We knew the army was in town.
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:03.920]  They did scyops of fake new expels. They hit the downtown cops with something and they passed out
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:09.440]  and collapsed. Then they hit the state police office and that bunch of them got sick. I mean
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:14.960]  they're just doing it all around us and I thought why not have Dr. Doug Rocky on because I had seen
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:20.240]  him with a new article that was up on info wars.com and we'll tell you the original site was posted
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:26.480]  on by him so you can visit there and see his other papers and reports. He was the head of the
[1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:31.360]  Pentagon's depleted uranium program. I mean he ran the studies. He wrote the books. You know he was
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:37.600]  there nuclear physicists PhD medical. He's got a bunch of degrees. It goes on and on
[1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:43.760]  and he was their expert and then he went in and was ordered to clean up the stuff in Iraq and
[1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:47.840]  was ordered to do it improperly and he knew it was improper. Then he watched his buddies die
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:51.440]  and others die and since then they've just said you're not allowed to hand out the old
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:56.720]  training films or manuals. The troops are told it's not bad for you. They're using it at proving
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:11:02.960]  grounds all over the U.S. and in protectorates and holdings possessions. They're using it in a
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:09.520]  bunch of different war zones. It's now not just in Vulcan guns and A10s or Abrams Sabo rounds.
[1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:15.280]  The M1A1 tanks it's now in Bradley fighting the vehicle guns. It's now in light arms 50
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:21.120]  cows. They're now serving it out in 308s 223 serving it out in mortars. They're serving it out
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:28.960]  in hellfires. They're serving it out in hundreds of munitions and this reaches a level of insanity
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:36.880]  and top generals go and stay in palaces that were hit with it too. I mean it is a death cult
[1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:44.560]  is all you could call it. I mean it is it is wanton insanity and there's no debating and
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:49.600]  I've had troops call me send me emails say well I'm on it I'm in a neighbor's tank and I wear a
[1:11:49.600 --> 1:11:54.960]  radiation badge and by the way my dad's a dentist and rural surgeon you know and I've worked as a
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:59.760]  dental assistant I've been in hospitals. I mean those radiation badges are for another type of
[1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:07.440]  radiation okay but to fool them when they're with this DU they give them these badges it's a sick
[1:12:07.440 --> 1:12:15.440]  joke to even a radiologist much less a nuclear physicist or a mechanical quantum physicist
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:21.360]  anybody a physicist who understands this. It is an insult to anyone's intelligence so we have the
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:27.840]  world expert really on the Pentagon calling the world expert on it and he has had a lot of health
[1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:33.520]  problems from it. He's had a lot of buddies die from it but now because of the proliferation of
[1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:39.840]  these weapons it is getting into water tables in the US Hawaii Puerto Rico when the citizens come
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:46.720]  out and protest SWAT teams just fire on them and rubber bullets and literally break jaws break heads
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:51.280]  while the idiot cops are breathing it right there on the seashore and and and I'm not against you
[1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:57.920]  cops I love you but you're idiots stop attacking us for trying to I'm sorry I'm digressing Dr. Doug
[1:12:57.920 --> 1:13:03.600]  Rocky I thought I'd get him on and and and first ask how his health's doing and then get his take
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:08.800]  on all the other biological and chemical and radiological testing to show this is a mindset
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:14.080]  and to get his take on why they do this what makes the elites tick. Dr. Doug Rocky thank you for
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:18.560]  coming on with us. Good afternoon Alex. What do you think of that little four-minute rant I mean
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:24.000]  do you agree with the statements? Absolutely I mean it's just staggering we have to understand that
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:29.440]  the uranium munitions you know the United States gave it to Israel and they used them in 1973 and
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:35.600]  74 against the Egyptians and they were extraordinarily effective and left the catastrophic mess in the
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.920]  Sinai desert that still remains with all the health problems that's totally verified and
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:44.960]  documented and then you know we did it in Desert Storm which was an incredible mess and as a
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:51.360]  consequence you know Swartz cost said well hey Doug go clean it up and well we never can clean it
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:57.120]  up we know that as you said we went on to do all the research what we learned and what I learned
[1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:01.280]  over all the years is being the Army's expert is that you can't use uranium munitions because
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:07.280]  there's absolutely no way to completely thoroughly clean it up and there is really no known medical
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:13.440]  care to treat it and that's been known going back to uh 1943 that we can verify but you have the
[1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:18.000]  uranium munitions continued use as you said uh it's one of the most astonishing thing I mean to
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.880]  the beginning of you know Operation Iraqi Freedom you know we lost an Abrams tank with a friendly
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:28.400]  fire from a 50 cal DU route you know it's who would ever thought that a 50 cal machine gun a
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:36.240]  rifle could take out an Abrams tank but it did and uh continues on to this day and then I mean
[1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:42.080]  you're leading on Project Shad Project Shad is continuing unabated I mean back so let's go Bay
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:46.240]  guy I've had to clean that up on military installations we've had smoke we've had everything
[1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:50.640]  all over across the nation and then the other funny thing is guess where the salmonella is coming
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:58.880]  from you know hey that's not in tomatoes guys that's from feces somebody had to put it in
[1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:03.120]  there deliberately it doesn't get up there the aliens are crapping all over the food
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:07.920]  everybody knows you so you know somebody'll come up with that but in the meantime we have hundreds
[1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:13.440]  of thousands of casualties from Operation Desert Storm we have hundreds of thousands of casualties
[1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:18.960]  from Operation Iraqi Freedom and enduring freedom and there's well over 200,000 dead I mean the
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:23.600]  lead story on army times again today and it just came in the mail as one of the medics who was over
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:28.560]  there and rescued this child in the middle of a firefight that should have never happened because
[1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:32.720]  we were attacked in Iraqis you know it's sort of like we went in there to give them their freedom
[1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:38.320]  but we're attacking them what's wrong with this picture and uh anyhow he committed suicide because
[1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:43.760]  again you know he never got the carry needed you know deliberately and delayed and denied
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:48.400]  totally ineffective that's another example in world war two you serve one tour vietnam one tour
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:55.440]  now five tours and and they just don't care I mean there's an attitude of the government acts
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:16:00.160]  like nothing's going to exist soon they act like it's the end they act like I mean before elites
[1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:06.960]  were corrupt but they had some concern for the future and going back to shad one of many operations
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:11.120]  we know there's a lot of other secret ones what do you think it was when the army was in town and
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:17.200]  police were collapsing it on the streets and in their offices and then they would announce weird
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:22.960]  nuclear spills and the army would shut things down that was in 2000 what do you think that was
[1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:28.080]  dr rocky oh i'm not sure but you know there's a lot of nasty stuff and then the 3000 marines just
[1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:33.280]  went into indianapolis and we're pulling all kinds of nasties off too so I mean but this goes back
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:38.160]  goes back to many many years I mean I got directly involved in in the middle 90s when we were planning
[1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:42.960]  the not lethal force and the martial law and the you know going into overthrow when we actually set
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:48.080]  up we had this though we had a full facility a community of town at Fort mccullough Alabama
[1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:53.040]  where we tried all this stuff out sadly I got involved until I saw the light but I want to
[1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:58.800]  hear about that I've never you've done so much but uh yeah as you said new information on the
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:02.160]  d-year but before we get into that I want to understand because you were in there planning
[1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:07.040]  you were involved in in you know a lot of this stuff you know until the light bulb finally clicked
[1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:11.840]  and it's like it's like you've been sleepwalking why am I doing this why am I involved in this
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:17.600]  dr rocky uh what is the mindset I mean obviously I've read some of their documents that they tell
[1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:21.680]  you we're testing this biological or chemical or radiological weapon on our own troops and
[1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:28.160]  killing them in many cases on the spot not just later from the after effects but but higher
[1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:34.320]  ups it's to test and see if your military doctors and military planners will hurt their own people
[1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:38.960]  to create cod rays who they know will do even more horrible things in the future
[1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:45.200]  like carry out a 9-11 dr rocky absolutely I mean it's it's a mindset we have to understand the myth
[1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:51.280]  has been propagated so extensively and I want to come back to because it's really part of it
[1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:55.760]  the myth has been propagated that there's an enemy out there that has a capability to invade and
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:18:02.960]  overthrow our government's you know and suspend our cherished rights that we have but the only
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:06.560]  one that's actually doing anything to suspend our cherished rights is the president of the
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:10.880]  united states you can really assign a bill today on wiretapping and eavesdropping that's
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:17.440]  totally illegal and he says he quote relishes he says he relishes it is the quote go ahead
[1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:23.760]  yeah and it's flat wrong you know so we've had this myth and when you look at the myth and I had
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:28.000]  to really sit down and look at this because of you know my own medical problems and trying to get
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:33.360]  medical care for all of the work I did in the military and the combat actions and research
[1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:39.520]  and everything else which is you know forget it nobody can get it um I just kind of look at the
[1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:45.600]  myth and when I really analyzed it and came out and said okay when is the last time that the
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:50.320]  united states had a viable enemy that had the capability over through our government to spend
[1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:54.960]  their bill of rights and do anything to us and the answer was never I mean you know we're going
[1:18:54.960 --> 1:19:00.320]  into Iraq and Afghanistan uh we're getting ready to go into Iran I mean it's momentary well the
[1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:05.760]  founding fathers said that they said if the public's armed no one in the world can overtake us if we
[1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:11.120]  fall it will be from treason and subterfuge within well absolutely and I think this you know the
[1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:15.600]  upholding of the uh second amendment of the constitution the bill of rights was just probably
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:19.440]  the most incredible thing that's only going to save this nation I mean that decision that was
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:25.040]  just made in the last few weeks is incredible but what we have to understand is the military has
[1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:28.640]  told this myth that you know these guys are coming they're going to jump out of your cereal box
[1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:33.600]  they're coming out of the sewer drain and it's not going to happen and it hasn't happened and then
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:39.280]  we go over and we intact and then we fade and we destroy and we kill and we maim and we contaminate
[1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:45.920]  and we do this all in this myth that we're providing them freedom stay there stay there
[1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:52.640]  dr. Doug or anki we'll be right back our beloved republic is on her knees the forces of globalism
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:57.840]  are destroying national sovereignty worldwide but in liberty's darkest hour there is hope the first

[1:23:55.440 --> 1:24:02.080]  dr doug rocky is our guest tired major out of the army all sorts of black ops you name it
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:09.280]  their du expert wrote the manuals for the pentagon of the army on it all right doc
[1:24:09.280 --> 1:24:13.040]  continuing with uh you were getting into the mindset what we're facing and i want to get into
[1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:20.880]  the new developments with du um please continue well you know the mindset is is in the military
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:24.960]  and this is the hardest thing that i had to come to grips with because i was involved in it is
[1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:30.080]  the mindset in his million military is how do we kill and how we do destroy effectively
[1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:33.600]  and when we're going to kill and we're going to destroy and wound
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:40.800]  the john Wayne or the Rambo thing comes into play you yourself think you're immune and you're
[1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:45.120]  going to use the most effective tool and most effective weapon that you have with complete total
[1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:51.440]  disregard for your own health total disregard for the type of casualties you generate in the
[1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:57.360]  medical care that's available and complete total disregard for the environment i mean it's killing
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:02.240]  destroying in the abstract sense and it feels great while you're a raw american flags on your
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:06.160]  shoulder but then when you're dying of cancer and you want medical care they're going to say
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:11.120]  you're just fine soldier yeah and that's what's happened today for example i mean literally i
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:16.400]  just got the mail out of the mailbox okay and i've got the summary data data total for the
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:20.800]  casually data for operation iraqi freedom and enduring freedom as of july 2nd i mean this
[1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:28.400]  came in the mail i took it out of the mail 20 minutes ago okay as of july 2nd in iraq we have
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:38.480]  4105 that have been killed in action and we have 30314 that have been wounded in action in afghanistan
[1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:46.240]  as of july 2nd we have 533 that have been killed in action and 2167 have been wounded in action
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:53.920]  but that's not the real story because the majority of the casualties and the report that i have is
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:59.840]  from january so it's six month old and this is analysis of via health care utilization
[1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:05.120]  among u.s global war terrorism veterans operation iraqi freedom and enduring freedom
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:14.560]  and when we look at the va data at six month old it states very very clearly okay and i want
[1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:22.720]  to reemphasize very very clearly 39 of all former active duty troops have sought medical care because
[1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:28.080]  of serious medical problems and 36 percent of all the individuals in the reserve in the national
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:34.640]  guard that have been deployed this all since 2002 have sought medical problems have sought medical
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:42.000]  care it's incredible also the suicide rates i was saying where it was it was something like 18
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:46.720]  times the previous record i saw that in the mainstream news a few weeks ago well you got a
[1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:51.040]  combination of suicide and murders you know so and we've got to look at what what is happening
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:54.720]  because there's been so many murders it's incredible i mean you know really highlighted
[1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:59.360]  right now another murder of a pregnant female soldier out in the east coast but when we look
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:04.080]  at the medical problems are absolutely verified totally verified by the department of better
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:10.400]  fare six years six months ago 33,783 was serious infections parasitic diseases
[1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:19.920]  2,611 confirmed malignant cancers 11,000 benign cancers 61,000 metabolic problems
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:28.320]  6,194 blood problems and this is leukemia and everything else 120,049 with a PTSD and we
[1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:36.960]  need to come back to that 98,741 was serious neurological problems now we know the neurological
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:42.320]  problems are directly related to two things this time around as it was before pesticides and nerve
[1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:49.600]  agents chemical weapons and uranium emissions absolutely totally directly related and i mean
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:53.120]  i've got all kinds of neurological problems and you know the doctors are totally confirming that
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:28:03.040]  from du uh 46,725 circulatory 57,312 serious respiratory now respiratory is the first thing
[1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:07.520]  that's affected with uranium exposure same thing with pesticides so what we're seeing is these
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:11.840]  young kids are dropping dead from cardiac problems and respiratory problems all over the place
[1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:19.040]  92,943 serious digestive system problems and what we're seeing is the whole digestive system has
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:24.640]  just gone to mush sort of like jello well i was just going to point out that i scan all the news
[1:28:24.640 --> 1:28:29.680]  and local news not all but a good part of it and people sent it to me every day if i look i see
[1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:35.360]  little stories where a guy in kansas a guy in texas upstate new york they're 25 years old they
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:39.520]  just come home and suddenly everything falls apart they're in a wheelchair and they're dead
[1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:44.480]  two weeks later and then they just say oh we don't know why he died well we know exactly what's
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:50.560]  happening then diseases of the skin the rashes i mean my rash is opening the bleeding right now alex
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:57.840]  it has not healed since it started 24 hours after i started doing like to clean up the du
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:04.240]  with the ground war in 1991 it's opening the bleeding as we talk right now and you know and
[1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:07.920]  i've got problems all over now you know i call them well how about wound management well you know
[1:29:07.920 --> 1:29:14.640]  bye bye go away um so rashes incredible numbers muscular skeletal system connective tissue
[1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:20.160]  now this the diagnosis for the formal diagnosis with this with the disability is fibromyalgia
[1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:24.320]  stay there sir we're going to be back in three minutes long segment with dr dug rocky

[1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:34.400]  serving it out to everybody now it's being used in every weapon system you can imagine it's being
[1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:44.160]  used in firing ranges near you they're right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex

[1:30:56.720 --> 1:31:02.640]  or at least we thought we did truth rising is a breakthrough 9 11 film that finally gives first
[1:31:02.640 --> 1:31:10.960]  responders a platform to tell their story women epa director on the 18th made a statement
[1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:18.480]  that the air was safe to breathe this film follows the growing momentum of 9 11 truth as brave souls
[1:31:18.480 --> 1:31:23.680]  throughout the world take action against their global masters he had his hand over the radio while
[1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:29.680]  he was getting a countdown he takes his hand off a year three two one and it was boom boom boom boom
[1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:37.600]  this is an emergency transmission worldwide download truth rising at prison planet dot tv
[1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:43.680]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the dvd at info wars dot com if we don't expose the
[1:31:43.680 --> 1:31:47.760]  government sponsored terror they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law
[1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:58.480]  oh life has changed we're not 21 anymore we have responsibilities that's why there's drinking made
[1:31:58.480 --> 1:32:03.360]  hangover defense sure we've done our share of partying yeah dude now kicking back with the
[1:32:03.360 --> 1:32:10.240]  neighbors and a few beers is more our style but let's face it as we get older even that can leave
[1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:15.680]  us feeling run down the next morning with drinking mate you can have a few drinks tonight without
[1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:20.880]  waking up feeling like you had a few drinking mates patented and proven formula of guava leaf
[1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:25.520]  extract has antioxidants and other unique properties that help prevent the headache
[1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:31.360]  queasy stomach and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind just dissolve one drink and mate
[1:32:31.360 --> 1:32:37.120]  in water and take it before bed it's that easy the next morning bring on the responsibilities
[1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:43.360]  drinking made hangover defense is available at retailers nationwide pick up some today
[1:32:43.360 --> 1:32:47.040]  hey remember your drinking mate and wake up feeling great
[1:32:52.400 --> 1:32:58.400]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:02.160]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:33:04.240 --> 1:33:09.520]  they always intriguing alan watson to join us for close to two hours in the 34th hour today
[1:33:09.520 --> 1:33:14.160]  of the rest of this hour dr. duck rocky before we go any further my new film truth rising is out
[1:33:14.800 --> 1:33:20.720]  this film needs to be seen it needs to be big it exposes how the first responders breathe the
[1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:28.640]  asbestos the mercury the lead some of their lungs have multiple ounces of these particles in the
[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:34.560]  mount sinai people die they've done autopsies it's in the film we say over a thousand that just came
[1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:38.160]  out a few weeks ago i mean that as we finish it a few weeks ago it came out last friday
[1:33:38.160 --> 1:33:44.080]  uh the number is really several thousand but that's certified by hospitals over a thousand
[1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:50.640]  55 000 they're saying will be dead within a few years uh and and that's not counting local schools
[1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:56.160]  and people and the epa documents came out they knew the dust was deadly and they said now you
[1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:02.720]  don't need breathing apparatus open the schools open wall street go in and so they always stonewall
[1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:09.760]  they always do uh whatever the most coal-hearted thing is the globalist revel in this it's another
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:13.920]  example of what we're talking about with dr. dug rocky today with the plete uranium which is far
[1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:19.840]  worse than the stuff killing the firefighters and police and medical workers and and and i want him
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:25.040]  to explain the difference between this type of radiation and the the particulate as a poison
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:31.040]  itself uh versus you know classical radiation that people think well my radiation badge they give me
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:37.920]  in the abram says i'm fine which is again a cruel uh joke uh with dr. dug rocky but please get
[1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:43.200]  truth rising it covers the first responders it covers how it's an inside job it shows the police
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:47.840]  state uh how they threaten we are changing 9 11 truth saying we're terrorists threatening to arrest
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:53.360]  us threatening to plant bombs on us it shows the media attacking us i mean it's a riveting film
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:58.080]  this is who the truth movement is it's meant to spread our numbers tell our story put a human
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:05.280]  face on us as we gain momentum jessie ventura willy nelson martin sheen uh george carlin right
[1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:09.040]  before he dies interviewed in the film uh then there's the enemy on the other side from bill
[1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:17.280]  clinton to hillary to barack obama to john mccain to rudolf juliani lin cheney uh i mean it's an
[1:35:17.280 --> 1:35:21.680]  unbelievable film ladies and gentlemen i i i sat down last night and watched like an hour of it
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:27.440]  you know my own film and i was like i made this i can't believe this this is so powerful get truth
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:34.000]  rising at info wars dot com our prison planet dot com today truth rising uh or simply call
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:40.960]  toll free to get it 8882533139 make as many copies as you can and get it out because if we don't
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:45.520]  expose the black ops carried out the attacks they're going to keep using more staged attacks
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:51.360]  to expand wars and set up a police state here at home going back to dug rocky just an amazing
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:55.360]  individual and i'm all over every comment he's making i apologize for interrupting i just think
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:35:59.520]  of every want to back up everything he's saying uh you were going through the list of things that
[1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:04.160]  are happening to the troops and and and the true holocaust uh that we're witnessing and we're not
[1:36:04.160 --> 1:36:08.880]  even getting the numbers on the contractors in cases that's even worse but i want to first digress
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:14.640]  go back to our earlier question we didn't get answered can you walk through why do you so deadly
[1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:20.400]  and and then and then explain its type of radiation versus uh you know why they're giving
[1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:28.240]  abram's drivers these radiation badges and saying see it's not bad for you yeah okay first off
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:33.200]  uranium munitions are the byproduct of the enrichment process by which the u.s. department
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:41.680]  energy extracts fissionable isotopes to make uh nuclear weapons and our nuclear fuel for reactors
[1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:47.440]  okay now for every saying again i'm going to put this percentage wise for every 100 pounds
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:57.600]  that goes into the process 99.4 pounds comes out is pure waste there's only 0.6 pounds out
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:02.880]  of every 100 pounds of this pure stuff that goes in that can be made that's visual isotopes can
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:09.360]  be extracted and make reactor fuel and uh nuclear weapons so we got 99 percent everything goes into
[1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:14.560]  this thing is pure waste well that's the actually the uranium hexafluoride that is then processed
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:21.680]  into solid uranium weapons okay so a du round we got a kinetic energy penetrator these are
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:30.400]  gigantic rods of solid uranium uranium 238 and then we have green 234 235 uranium 236 plutonium
[1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:36.640]  neptunium and america that's what's in the round a tank round every single round is over 10 pounds
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:41.120]  of solid solid uranium they're not coated they're not tipped and then you already mentioned the
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:45.840]  abrams tank that's what that is then you got the 810 warthog aircraft every single one's about
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:50.720]  three quarters of pound of solid uranium and they fire them at 4 000 rounds a minute that's a ton
[1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:56.720]  and a half uranium on target per minute and then we got the bradley fighting vehicles a half pound
[1:37:56.720 --> 1:38:00.960]  the navy phalanx is a half pound and the navy phalanx they're shooting it up all over the place
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:06.720]  right in the base and harbour's coast guard now has it uh they've been shooting it up i mean the
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:13.040]  reagan task force left and we got word from one of the gunners that they shot it up you know
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:19.600]  i'll let's see so it's all over the place so we know this stuff is happening now what happens is
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:28.080]  uranium weapons are primarily an alpha emitter they also have beta gamma and x-rays the badge you
[1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:32.240]  know that x-ray technician the dentist they all wear they're given these guys these are for gamma
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:38.720]  emissions only they're not going to pick up anything else you can't detect the alpha emissions from
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:43.680]  a d-round if you're greater than a half inch away from it and the beta emissions if you're
[1:38:43.680 --> 1:38:48.320]  greater than four to six inches away from it however when this stuff explodes detonates burns
[1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:53.200]  whatever creates a fine dust that goes right through all known respiratory protection all
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:59.520]  through known skin protection it gets into the body and devastates the body just simple as that
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:06.480]  and you did the studies i mean it gets into the lungs but but even i mean i've got uh the uh you
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:11.920]  know federal mining commission and others in the 60s when they were mining all this saying how deadly
[1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:18.160]  just tiny amounts of uranium were in the rock and how it was killing all the miners even though
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:23.280]  they had breathing apparatus and i mean we're talking about thousands of times stronger here when
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:30.240]  it's been purified uh and and of course i've seen you cover and i've read the report myself what was
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:38.720]  it a 1946 report 1943 uh what was the report where they i guess i saw another 46 report uh mentioned
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:43.280]  then uh where they first coined the term dirty bomb and the u.s. government wanted to drop it on
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:48.320]  german cities but decided it would hurt our troops when they came in and then they talked about this
[1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:55.680]  d u gas can you uh talk about that well what we had was back 1943 the s1 commission told uh
[1:39:56.560 --> 1:40:01.120]  the general in manhattan project let's say grow up to use your uh radioactive materials
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:06.640]  okay to contaminate air water and soil and cause all health problems back in 1943 we didn't have
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:11.680]  fissionable materials because we hardly had any reactors okay so this is all radioactive
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:16.240]  materials so it's real simple and so that was the original dirty bomb directive which we
[1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:21.120]  continued to do and we're doing dirty bombs all over and giving them to our friends so what we've
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:26.160]  got is just a nightmare now back you know when we're doing all this research and put our reports
[1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:34.560]  out trying to get a stop we found out real clearly that you can't clean it up once you use it there
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:41.680]  is no effect of medical care now within the department of defense they'll tell the public
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:45.760]  and tell the military personnel that there's no problems or anything okay from uranium
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:50.480]  munitions exposure to contamination however the orders are out there mandating thorough medical
[1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:56.400]  care within 24 hours of exposure the army regulations require complete thorough environmental
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:02.000]  remediation the army regulations and procedures require that everybody goes anywhere near it
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:06.880]  within 50 meters where full respiratory and skin protection and then when you get into the
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:11.920]  briefings have been given to the senior leadership at the pentagon that are in all the way to the
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:18.640]  white house by colonel j. edgar wakiyama who was uh you know like the top dog on testing
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:27.600]  evaluation quote cell damage and cancer lung cancer is well documented uh continues on the
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:32.720]  beta particle hazards the skin lens of the eye oh yeah hey you know i've got radiation cataracts
[1:41:33.520 --> 1:41:38.000]  my vision is messed up and the surgery is very dangerous took two hours just to
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:42.800]  fix one eye and they thought 30 minutes was going to be it we go on and we look at the stuff
[1:41:43.440 --> 1:41:48.800]  uh continuously uh heavy metal like lead target organ is a kidney in the bone what's far greater
[1:41:49.520 --> 1:41:55.840]  uh cultured human stem bone cell line with d was transformed the cells become carcinogenic
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:42:02.880]  it's urine samples containing uranium mutagenic by the aims test these are this is the internal
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:09.280]  briefings i mean uh just continuously on all of the hazards the radiation limits
[1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:13.520]  wounding by that point is i've i mean i've read all the documents working on in game
[1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:17.600]  and uh you know i interviewed you over the years and i've seen the army training films
[1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:23.200]  that you helped put together they admit i mean just 20 years ago they said this is deadly this
[1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:28.320]  is only use of the russians are overrunning us in europe uh this stuff is never to be used unless
[1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:34.160]  we're an all-out already nuclear war and and and it's a last weapon and then suddenly they just
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:38.720]  said you know what we're telling the public it's good for you and that's the end of it i mean why
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:44.560]  did they have that i mean they had some morals before what when did this psychopathic mindset
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:51.520]  come into effect well yeah what i learned about it was in march of 1991 as i was getting ready to
[1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:56.880]  start the cleanup of all the friendly fire uranium weapons friendly fire rallies and
[1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:01.840]  Abrams tanks during desert storm they handed me two memorandum and you've seen these one is
[1:43:01.840 --> 1:43:07.360]  called a las alamos memorandum written by the u.s. marine court colonel michael z and it was very
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:11.840]  clear we know they're serious adverse health and environmental effects therefore lie in your reports
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:17.440]  so we can sustain the use maintain propensity in uranium when weapons never become politically
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:24.240]  unacceptable that one was very clear lie and i'm going not going to happen guys at the same time
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:29.520]  i get another memorandum from the defense nuclear agency and you know the head guys on the experts
[1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:34.560]  on bombs and colonel lios said this stuff not only health hazards a serious health hazards we
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:40.560]  have to think about all the contamination airwater soil cleanup and the whole mess and so we've got
[1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:44.960]  one thing saying this stuff's so dangerous it's incredible and the other one says ignore the
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:52.080]  dangers and when we got to december of 1992 we had put all the reports together and finally the
[1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:57.040]  assistant secretary of the army walker ordered us to do a study and this was at the u.s. army
[1:43:57.040 --> 1:44:03.360]  environmental policy institute and serial research lab co-located here at the university of illinois
[1:44:03.360 --> 1:44:07.360]  guess where i went on loan from the university of illinois over there to do this understand
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:12.320]  whatever they have a problem they call i'm tired of being a jack in the box because they don't want
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:18.800]  the problem solved they just want smoking mirrors and uh we were ordered i mean directly ordered
[1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:24.080]  to figure out ways to reduce the toxicity of uranium emissions that's impossible and then
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:28.960]  we were ordered to figure out how to clean it all up well that i did they wanted to cherry pick your
[1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:34.400]  reports as i saw him do it later and act like uh twist your reports and act like they found a
[1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:39.040]  way to make it safe absolutely and the same thing with the radiation exposures i mean
[1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:44.800]  we have to understand when we look at the various specifics in the army technical both and the maximum
[1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:50.960]  per allowable exposure for beta radiation is less than 0.05 millirems per hour and we're looking at
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:55.920]  100 counts per minute for alpha what we learned and what we saw is we could never get down below
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:45:01.360]  thousands and 300 uh millirems per hour and no matter what we ever did if you use the proper
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:06.480]  measurement techniques and proper equipment as you mentioned and this is really critical
[1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:12.240]  standard radiac equipment and standard techniques will not even find this stuff you could have a
[1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:17.360]  pilot so dangerous and so great that it could take out an entire city and you won't find it with
[1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:24.160]  the standard geiger counter and i think this is just brought home real recently because um and this
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:30.160]  is part of the new stuff we talked about in the summer of 1991 as desert storm wound you know wound
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:35.280]  down we were storing all of our equipment to get ready for what's now become desert storm to operation
[1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:39.840]  iraqi freedom or to be on calm so we had all kinds of armor and equipment weapons of all
[1:45:39.840 --> 1:45:45.600]  type munitions of all types stored at camp doha in koi uh some of the chemical and biological
[1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:50.160]  weapons that we had recollected you know from iraqi we had given to them prior to desert
[1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:56.240]  storm was stored there also you know and we kept blowing it all up and uh what happened uh a guy
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:00.640]  wanted to refuel a truck and he didn't put a grounding strap on and he started a fire static
[1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:05.920]  discharge the whole place blew up and burned up i lost three of my guys got killed there i was back
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:09.760]  in the states they immediately called and said what do we do and i said well follow the technical
[1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:14.240]  bulletin on fighting fires and cleaning up and get everybody to safety well it never happened
[1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:18.400]  and then part of our team flew over there i stayed back here they went over to do it and
[1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:23.360]  three guys got killed well what happened here in the last few months is the kawaii government the
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:28.320]  america way told the united states department of defense you have to clean up all that contamination
[1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:33.040]  because there's so many medical and environmental problems you have to clean up camp doha and get
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:38.320]  rid of it so the united states got a contractor and again without training teaching them or
[1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:44.000]  giving them equipment everything they dug up over 6700 tons of contaminants oil and sand
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:48.080]  that was a death sentence for the people the ones that do that yeah absolutely but you have to
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:53.920]  understand um dr michael killpatrick and dr melissa mcdermott don't care they don't care they
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:58.480]  totally don't care and we've been around and around on this with just some truck drivers and
[1:46:58.480 --> 1:47:03.120]  some guys from a construction company guys that know how to run back hose they all just hey honey
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:07.680]  i'm getting paid double time i'm going over to kawaii and then they and then they don't even tell
[1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:10.800]  you hey you're about to clean up something that's going to kill you better than a hammer in a few
[1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:15.440]  years yeah well you know we saw that you know we that's been documented with all this stuff
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:21.200]  so anyhow what happened is they dug up over 6700 tons of contaminated soil terrain and
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:25.360]  everything else they put it in ships and they brought it back to long view washington the
[1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:30.400]  state of washington to report they've unloaded they're unloading it long view washington put it
[1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:39.120]  into rail cars and they're transported 6700 tons of contaminated sand and soil with radiological
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:45.040]  chemical biological hazardous materials conventional munitions contamination plus all the insects
[1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:50.640]  the bugs and the microbes from middle east to boys the i to hopper burial which by the way again
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:54.720]  all these environmental rules are only for us the public it's not for the government they dump
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:59.440]  nuclear reactors in the ocean they dump toxic waste in the Delaware river nerve gas killing
[1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:04.400]  every fish that's mainstreamish they're shipping all this into the middle of the country and they've
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:12.320]  got all sorts of horrible parasites and burrowing mites and uh it's it's in a horrible varieties
[1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:16.720]  of of spiders that make black widows look wonderful don't they dug yeah it's horrible i mean when
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:21.200]  you look at the stuff so anyhow this all been brought in and so we tried to stop it we said
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:26.080]  wait you can't do this well you know again as they said they can violate the laws with immunity
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:30.720]  well recently the governor for Idaho said well there's no problem we took a geiger counter
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:35.760]  outside the containers the train cars and we didn't measure any radio activity i mean how
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:42.320]  stupid do you get and how stupid can anybody get so now the united states government department
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:47.120]  defense doctor michael kilpatrick and all of them and the generals have said uranium munitions
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:52.000]  contamination poses no risk however we've dug up six thousand seven hundred tons of
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:55.920]  thoroughly contaminated stuff that's causing problems in kawait we're shipping it back to
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:49:01.200]  the united states for burial in a isolated site well not really isolated but boys the Idaho
[1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:09.200]  it's nuts so we've got that problem real world here's another example they are moving the plum
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:15.120]  island level four bio weapons lab off the coast of new york our first official bio weapons lab
[1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:20.640]  in before four day trick maryland and they are moving it to san antonio in the middle of the
[1:49:20.640 --> 1:49:26.240]  city a level four and they're and they and they're building it and it's not even rated level three
[1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:31.520]  doc i mean that's what i mean they're building 36 level four bio labs and they're putting them
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:37.200]  on coastlines in galveston texas they're i mean what has happened to the people running things
[1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:43.200]  it's just well we'll go back to go back to plum island you know one day there was a breach of
[1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:48.560]  plum island okay and they had a serious breach in this back in 1998 all of a sudden we got a call
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:52.800]  and said oh my what's now virus got out guys now what are we going to do can you clean it up
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:59.440]  and we're going sorry and then that showed up in man in central park and then it's marked all
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:04.560]  the way across the nation and let's be clear it's also documented that weaponized limes disease
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:10.080]  came from deer swimming from plum into the city so i mean we have to understand that's where it
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:15.360]  came from and you know in the military it's all there when you go to the regal commission report
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:19.520]  they i mean it's totally documented in the us senate report that's the question i gotta hold
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:22.160]  you over a little bit the next hour if you can do it because we run out of time and i want to
[1:50:22.160 --> 1:50:27.280]  i'm gonna i'm gonna push uh our next guest back a little if you can do it i mean i live here in
[1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:33.680]  austin folks that they're they're putting a level four bio weapon lab weaponized super
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:42.320]  viruses and bacteria a zoological uh center down the street from me in a level two laboratory
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:48.240]  folks i'm i mean it the elite have gone insane dr dug rocky we'll be right back

[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:30.480]  wont joins us i'll play a cnn clip where the director of plum island broke ranks and said
[1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:36.880]  we've had bio releases from this lab already in the ocean to the united states a mile away
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:42.720]  you can't stick it in san antonio in that lab for those that don't know level four is underground
[1:54:42.720 --> 1:54:48.720]  it's got humans don't go into the areas where the the test animals or humans are being tested on
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:53.920]  it's got minefields around it it's got emergency buttons where they can burn it down
[1:54:53.920 --> 1:55:00.400]  no they're just going to stick it in labs behind locked doors with just glass it's just ha ha ha
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:05.440]  it's all so much fun level two and you can't i saw in the news they can't even get a level three
[1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:13.840]  rating for the san antonio lab and uh there's this total denial uh dot continue anyhow you
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:17.360]  know we still got uranium weapons have been used extensively throughout the middle east
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:22.880]  in afghanistan with horrible consequences samalia the balkans and then obviously we've
[1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:27.680]  shot it up in you know all over the place here we've got vx port urico's still in nightmare
[1:55:28.320 --> 1:55:33.040]  and uh and then what we have is and let's come back to american history okay we just had the
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:40.400]  fourth of july didn't we on the 18th of april is 75 hardly a man is left alive one upon a time all
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:48.640]  of us had to memorize paul reveres right didn't we yes concord massachusetts is where our nation
[1:55:48.640 --> 1:55:56.000]  was born correct yes the minute man the united states environmental protection agency has labeled
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:02.800]  the star met uranium weapons lab as a super fun national priority list site
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:08.640]  guess what the department of defense is refusing to clean it up but they're refusing to clean up
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:12.560]  for detrick and all of those sites you know the nuclear weapon the other weapons site i want to
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:17.760]  get into that super site where they make it or put it together but what about these reports i'm
[1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:22.480]  seeing everywhere that there's that they're that they're shooting them at military shooting ranges
[1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:28.800]  now all over the country unauthorized and that they're finding du all over absolutely we you
[1:56:28.800 --> 1:56:33.440]  know we so we've got this stuff but what happened i mean this is another one absolutely totally
[1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:38.480]  confirmed in hawaii not only uranium weapons in hawaii but nuclear weapons davie crockett's in
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:43.040]  hawaii and you know there's some really good estimates that uh for folks that don't know tell
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:48.560]  them what a davie crockett is great davie crockett is a handheld handheld uh nuclear weapon is uh
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:54.400]  you know very low yield but uh it's one of those things that could be used it was from the 50s
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:59.280]  in the 60s and again there's a whole bunch of those missing from the arsenal in hawaii and they're
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:03.280]  very distinctive they could just pulverize a building and bring it totally down in a
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:07.760]  in a couple of seconds like total freefall you know and then it'll give you kinds of you know
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:12.240]  there's physicists in england that have analyzed and say that it looks like there may have been
[1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:18.480]  small nukes in the towers probably davie crockett based on yeah there's a really well for those that
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:22.720]  don't know who did who weren't in this in the army in secret programs tell folks what these
[1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:28.800]  tiny frogs are what these tiny uh tacticals are well i mean they could just done battlefield
[1:57:28.800 --> 1:57:32.880]  tactical nuclear weapons for small building structures or concentrations of troops in
[1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:37.280]  the hope of not getting anybody else so they're out there and they're missing anyhow let's come
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:42.480]  back to star met star met it was a weapons facility where they built uranium weapons in concord
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:48.160]  massachusetts the whole neighborhood the area around there has horrible medical effects exactly what i
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:53.440]  just listed for what we're seeing from uh operation iraqi freedom and during freedom which exactly
[1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:59.280]  matched the 300 000 plus casualties we have from desert storm and the 70 some thousand dead from
[1:57:59.280 --> 1:58:05.280]  desert storm so we're looking at this stuff the estimates on this is again the epa estimate is
[1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:13.840]  64 million dollars just to clean up the star met site in concord massachusetts but they don't have the
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:17.840]  ability to do it they've totally disregarded everything they figure all this stuff is just
[1:58:17.840 --> 1:58:22.320]  going to continue to cause medical problems dr. dug rocky stay there for one minute quick break
[1:58:22.320 --> 1:58:27.120]  start the next hour i want to come back and go over more of this with the leading expert on du

[2:00:25.040 --> 2:00:29.680]  using it at military bases everywhere they're using it around all the major ports with the
[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:35.920]  with the coast guard they're lying to the uh coast guard the the sailors the marines the army the
[2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:42.800]  air force and folks they're not going to be there patty on the back when you're dying uh but but
[2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:49.680]  doc for me it really comes down to a change in mindset like they know the gmo cross species foods
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:55.120]  create new uh compounds new amino acids that kill all the mammals that eat it over time
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:01:02.080]  we know it's hurting humans they're still approving it no one else is it's all us in the us uh we know
[2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:06.480]  du is killing all these people we know the their own reports admit it's killing people they don't
[2:01:06.480 --> 2:01:12.880]  care uh we know they're building 3600 bio shield bio weapons labs around the country uh in areas
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:18.320]  that aren't level four uh everyone's freaking out and can't believe it they don't care uh and i know
[2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:22.320]  you're going over all the evidence of this and my audience knows about a lot of that thanks to you
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:28.640]  and others but i keep getting back to it's scary that we have an evil elite but also to think that
[2:01:28.640 --> 2:01:33.920]  they're just it's like they want to destroy the planet sure it's that they want to destroy the
[2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:40.640]  planet it's this rambo mentality okay john wane we got to go to war we got to kill and destroy
[2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:44.560]  and we're out there killing or destroy and people oppose absolutely no threat to us okay
[2:01:45.280 --> 2:01:49.840]  none at all but we just want to do it so we can do it and then we have to develop the next
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:54.400]  generation of weapon the next best weapon so what we'll see and i mean this is thoroughly
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:01:58.720]  documented we'll develop a weapon and then we'll sell it and we'll give it away and all of a sudden
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:02.640]  the people we sold it and gave it away to become our enemy so now we get all they've got this so
[2:02:02.640 --> 2:02:08.640]  we have to develop the next generation of weapon and so it just continues on and on and on and on
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:15.760]  i bet we're going to see local cops using du soon well yeah yeah we had a standing joke uh
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:20.080]  when i was director of the pleaded uranium project we were down okay we're at port mcclellan
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:24.080]  albama so we all hunted okay and everybody we bow hundred and you know hundred with gunch okay
[2:02:24.640 --> 2:02:28.320]  and was standing joke was you know what we're going to do is here this is real easy
[2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:32.400]  we're going to take our compound bow we're going to get ourselves our narrow we're going to take
[2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:36.720]  and take a broadhead arrow you know raise your edge we're going to make out out of du so and
[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:40.400]  here's how we're going to do it we don't have to worry about a whole lot we're going to go hunting
[2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:45.120]  we're going to use a du arrow have to understand uranium burns through the air as it's moving
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:50.240]  so we're firing the arrow it's got a broadhead it's on fire so it's slice of dice is cook it
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:55.600]  and cook your meat all at once so it's ready to eat in the field the general didn't like that
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:03.200]  you know so it's horrible because what we know today thoroughly documented is that the united
[2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:08.720]  states great britain australia canada have used uranium emissions against not only armor which
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:13.520]  is what it was designed for the conventional cars and trucks totally documented against
[2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:18.320]  apartment buildings and houses they're only documented against hospitals water treatment
[2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:23.520]  facilities through sanitation plants against everything because it's extraordinarily effective
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:29.120]  against all targets and they just use it with total disregard the common task training every
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:33.120]  military member is supposed to go through states very clearly this stuff will cause
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:38.000]  contaminate air water and soil and let's be clear they blow the hell out of afghanistan
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:43.920]  kosovo iraq and then our troops moving to the very basis that have been hit by it correct and that's
[2:03:43.920 --> 2:03:49.040]  why we have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of casualties that are fighting for medical care
[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:52.800]  but when it comes back to this thing you know out in san francisco they just had the big court
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:57.440]  trial and again it's discussed in the army times it just came in the mail where the federal judge
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:04:01.120]  out there rule he has no authority to force the department of better and fairer department
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:05.760]  events to provide prompt and effective medical care even though it's thoroughly documented that
[2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:11.920]  is not being done care is deliberately delayed and denied and then you talk about the ptsd
[2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:17.760]  and we talked about the suicides let's come down to it very clearly we have hundreds of thousands
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:23.440]  of reported diagnosed with ptsd but at the same time we have hundreds of thousands diagnosed with
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:31.200]  serious physiological problems due to toxic exposures the ptsd is a function of toxic exposures
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:35.760]  where the brain and the body no longer function yeah they're just using that as a cover a psychological
[2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:39.360]  cover they did that in the first call four all your teeth are falling out you're dying of brain

[2:07:56.800 --> 2:08:00.960]  five six minutes left without a duck rock you have to have a month sooner we've covered a lot of
[2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:06.800]  areas and it's not just the du it's the bio weapons labs it's the chemical biological testing
[2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:10.320]  i want you to have about five minutes to cover anything else you think's most important doc with
[2:08:10.320 --> 2:08:16.000]  all of my you know jumping and adding a different points but i want to get your take on the mindset
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:22.640]  of say part of project shed and a few of the famous cases of marching our troops british troops in
[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:27.120]  and nerve-gassing them to death in chambers not telling them they were going to kill them and then
[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:33.040]  lying to the families i mean why do they do that how do they do that and what does that say about
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:38.080]  who's running our society we have to understand this is part of the reason why the united states
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:42.880]  gave iraq all the chemical and biological weapons for use against iran and the iraq occurrence in the
[2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:50.480]  in the eighties we've wanted to see how effective our weapons were so that we could use them in
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:56.880]  warfare and as a consequence the mindset of the individuals and i worked with these people and i
[2:08:56.880 --> 2:09:02.080]  learned with them and i taught them and i talked with them until i saw the light came on they don't
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:08.480]  care we all reach out there and try to figure out how do we understand this mindset of killing
[2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:12.560]  and destroying completely complete utter disregard for the health in the environment
[2:09:13.840 --> 2:09:20.480]  and i can't come up with any answer yet it exists now what we have today is we have hundreds of
[2:09:20.480 --> 2:09:25.280]  thousands of casualties from the uc uranium weapons misuse of all the other munitions
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:32.560]  conventional missions have horrible side effects also we have ptsd coming back and the ptsd and the
[2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:37.520]  horrible suicides are a function of three things number one being so scared you pee in your pants
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:46.000]  normal combat historical number two toxic exposures the medical evidence is there this is not
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:52.800]  mental this is physiological toxic exposure and the last thing is a realization all of a
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:57.040]  sudden dawns on them they've been lied to and lied to and lied to and lied to
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:04.960]  and you can't deal with it you can't deal with it the average guy doesn't have the ability the
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:10.880]  knowledge he doesn't have the wherewithal or the resources to understand what's going on
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:15.680]  and he's left out there without medical care so we have hundreds of thousands trying to obtain
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:20.640]  medical care and they cannot get proper and optimal medical care from the department of
[2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:25.040]  veterinary affairs or from the department of veteran you know department of well that's what
[2:10:25.040 --> 2:10:29.360]  i keep seeing in these reports of most of these guys that commit suicide are real sick they say
[2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:34.080]  they got rashes they're throwing up they that their back hurts uh they're they're bleeding
[2:10:34.080 --> 2:10:38.080]  they've got tumors and they don't give them health care and then they kill themselves and the news
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:42.240]  says oh they were mentally ill but what you're saying and what the evidence does show is a lot
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:48.800]  of this isn't cracking up it's that they are so sick uh that they're in excruciating pain
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:53.920]  but the VA is mandated and this is admitted to cover it up because they don't want people knowing
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:11:00.240]  that uh in both Gulf Wars there was chemical weapons released from blowing up the facilities
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:05.440]  and and Saddam may have used them and and and then now the du they've got to cover that up
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:12.880]  absolutely so it comes down to the bottom line you know we go to war to control oil and resources
[2:11:12.880 --> 2:11:17.680]  that's what it's absolutely about i mean most interesting here in the last few days it's come
[2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:23.600]  out totally that the major oil corporations have now got a foothold back into iraq and they wanted
[2:11:23.600 --> 2:11:28.800]  in iran they wanted afghanistan and the balkans took an end apricot to control all oil resources
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:33.520]  you know carte blanche that's what it's about has nothing to do with giving you cheap gas
[2:11:34.240 --> 2:11:38.800]  it's total control of the domination of the world market and our military has been used to do this
[2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:44.720]  for all over and over and over again for hundreds of years so we're coming down to the bottom line
[2:11:44.720 --> 2:11:49.840]  and this is the choice i had to make from learning firsthand experience with chem
[2:11:49.840 --> 2:11:54.960]  biological uranium weapons and everything else the weapons we use today in warfare
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:12:00.880]  have catastrophic immediate and long-term adverse health and environmental effects
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:06.560]  and we can't use them anymore because we can't clean it up and we don't have the medical care
[2:12:06.560 --> 2:12:12.880]  but the leaders of our nation and the leaders of the nation's you know with the charge don't care
[2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:18.960]  there is no accountability i can call the department of defense the us army the department of
[2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:22.800]  veteran affairs inspector general all the time and i do trying to get things done taking care of
[2:12:23.520 --> 2:12:29.600]  they don't respond and they don't care retaliation as you know thoroughly documented is swift and
[2:12:29.600 --> 2:12:34.640]  brutal against anybody that speaks out the truth or demands accountability or in the case of the
[2:12:34.640 --> 2:12:39.760]  department of defense we re ask them to man that they comply with their own orders and regulations
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:44.320]  which are legal mandates provide medical care and clean up the environment whether it's at concord
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:52.080]  in massachusetts beckons port urico albany new york over here jeffson proven ground hawaii
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:12:57.360]  or wherever it is but they simply refuse to do it it's scary
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:04.480]  well dr ronkey you're this is just another big piece of the puzzle what you're covering and and
[2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:07.120]  you know what you're revealing here and that's the point i keep going back to
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:14.560]  you uh is that just 10 20 30 years ago the elites were still reckless and bad and corrupt
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:20.080]  but they were still uh wise to the point of they didn't want to hurt themselves or get
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:27.280]  things out of control that could bring down the whole system and now hey we'll release you know
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:34.880]  weaponized uh lime disease and and uh of course as you know they admit it came out of there uh the
[2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:39.360]  west isle out of out of uh plumb island off new york now we're going to put these in your major
[2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:44.080]  cities and yeah we're going to uh genetically engineer food knowing it kills all the mammals
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:48.320]  that eat it over time uh you know and we're going to feed our kids it i mean the elite most of them
[2:13:48.320 --> 2:13:56.240]  feed their kids this stuff i mean it's like it's it's it's it's a mass uh recklessness self
[2:13:56.240 --> 2:14:01.040]  destructiveness i guess that you see with rich kids that want to run a car off a cliff or drive
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:06.720]  reckless or od on drugs and it seems like they're just i mean look at the pathology the mindset
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:14.240]  the psychology that that it's just on a hundred fronts it it's everywhere police brutality corruption
[2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:20.560]  congress saying unlimited spying total immunity no fourth amendment today uh bush saying i relish
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:29.840]  doing this i mean it is just it is mania it's crazy but we have to stop it because we have to
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:34.240]  speak up we have to do something we have to demand accountability and that requires each and every one
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:39.200]  of us to step forward and do something like you've been doing alex i mean you've been doing it for
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:45.920]  years god bless you alex god bless you dr dug rocky i mean it gets worse and worse everything
[2:14:45.920 --> 2:14:51.520]  we talked about comes truing it gets worse than i even thought and and and and and those that are
[2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:56.400]  deciding with this evil that just giggle and smirk like it's like it's cute it's i mean it's like
[2:14:56.400 --> 2:15:02.000]  some 90 year old man who's gone into dementia rubbing you know what all over themselves laughing
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:10.640]  at us it's not funny i mean you know this is insane this is dangerous and uh it it god help us well
[2:15:10.640 --> 2:15:14.640]  give out some of the websites where you post articles and reports and documents what are some
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:19.760]  of them your stuff's everywhere but what are some of the better places to visit you know trap rock was
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:24.320]  and trap rock had hostile takeover but you know you still get the trap rock and i'm not sure exactly
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:29.520]  that thing it's grassroots peace now is what charlie is and sonny are doing what they're out there
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:34.800]  and uh just try and get the information you have to understand here are the army regulations here
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:38.640]  is the information these are their internal briefings this is what's required this is what's
[2:15:38.640 --> 2:15:43.120]  known and we need to hold them accountable for what they've done and demand that they comply
[2:15:43.120 --> 2:15:47.760]  with their own requirements that's where we were talking about absolutely offer we're talking about
[2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:53.840]  all the deformities of us troops children the contractors the iraqis the serbs the afghans
[2:15:53.840 --> 2:15:57.840]  and uh the troops are going my god i've had two kids in a row they're totally deformed
[2:15:57.840 --> 2:16:04.400]  the army says do you use good for you all i can do is cry i got another email yesterday with another
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:08.960]  photograph of another child who was born that's horrible and the question this was a contractor
[2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:12.320]  and they're saying could this have been caused by do you want to say i don't know we have to get
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:16.080]  the medical exam answer all the questions where they were exposed what happened what did they do
[2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:21.120]  but when we see the same thing the deformities over and over and over again contractors military
[2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:27.520]  personnel our own or the other residents of these nations have to understand they're not insurgents
[2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:33.120]  they're not terrorists they are the people that occupy their nation that are opposing our illegal
[2:16:33.120 --> 2:16:37.840]  invasion and occupy but but even if the troops hate them and say oh let's kill them a lot of
[2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:42.560]  videos of them shooting innocent women and children and celebrating it's they're getting killed you
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:47.680]  know the goons and the well-meaning people that are doing this they're getting killed by it and
[2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:54.000]  i mean when you see 300 400 500 percent increases in Serbia and Iraq as you know doctor of deformities
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:17:00.080]  associated with uranium i mean it it's clear we know it's the du doing it don't we absolutely this
[2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:04.720]  time around we only have pesticides we have uranium emissions and we have the adverse reactions to
[2:17:04.720 --> 2:17:09.120]  the immunizations that's all we have this time around all right contrast the desert storm
[2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:13.120]  dr. dug rocky i want to have you back up in the near future god bless you sir thank you and god

[2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:21.920]  i just have another guest and i'm waiting to get them in the wings they're very important
[2:17:21.920 --> 2:17:27.520]  guests just like yourself briefly you mentioned separately how you trained for martial law now
[2:17:27.520 --> 2:17:31.600]  that's been declassified now separately but in just two minutes was we're going to break and this
[2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:35.600]  interviews has to end then we got alan walk coming up but i want to ask him about this too
[2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:40.160]  tell us about the marshal i mean they were openly telling you guys this was in preparation for
[2:17:40.160 --> 2:17:45.360]  marshal on the u.s absolutely i was under clinton administration again presidential decision
[2:17:45.360 --> 2:17:51.200]  directors 39 and 62 which is you know the whole thing put together and what happened is we were
[2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:56.240]  working together with weapons not lethal weapons and again this is the microwave gun beam gun that's
[2:17:56.240 --> 2:18:01.600]  mounted on the jeep that cooks people alive or stuff like this and so what was happening we had
[2:18:01.600 --> 2:18:06.160]  all over the place mount villages where you track practice and going into overtake this stuff and
[2:18:06.160 --> 2:18:11.360]  overthrow the governments most recently the u.s. marine 3000 marines went into indianapolis to
[2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:17.280]  do it we've had exercises all over the place again just come down and look at what's happening
[2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:22.720]  and it's scary it's frightening because the individuals are brainwashed and they believe
[2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:26.560]  these myths and they believe that there's also such a threat out there that we have to do this
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:31.120]  and let's be clear when you were in the army as a major overseeing this stuff they were admitting
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:37.600]  the officers to you this was for america oh sure i mean how would they try to sell that to you what
[2:18:37.600 --> 2:18:42.480]  would they say uh you know here's the threat this way to happen we have to protect ourselves and do
[2:18:42.480 --> 2:18:47.520]  this inside there's such an evil median i don't know it just it just got to be beyond comprehension
[2:18:47.520 --> 2:18:51.280]  but then you do this stuff and then you go overseas and you use it all over there too
[2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:56.320]  i mean ask yourself the question why do 3000 united states marines
[2:18:56.320 --> 2:19:02.880]  have to go to indianapolis indiana to do an exercise within the community nuclear biological
[2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:09.200]  chemical warfare special operations rf weapons microwave gun weapons inside a town well that's
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:14.000]  the condition the public to accept it when they do it for real correct and that an acclimation

[2:24:12.640 --> 2:24:20.480]  the matrix dot com great guy great research dovetails with mine and again there's a lot of
[2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:24.880]  things that i wasn't aware of we all share information we all that's how we all go to
[2:24:24.880 --> 2:24:31.280]  another level of understanding and that's why he's here uh last hour i had dr dug rocky
[2:24:31.280 --> 2:24:36.560]  head of the du program for the pentagon the army on how they knowingly know it's killing tens of
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:40.160]  thousands of troops going to kill millions worldwide they're using it at military bases
[2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:48.640]  all over the u.s. now uh they are openly putting in landfills just blowing around on on major cities
[2:24:48.640 --> 2:24:54.480]  they're building level uh four bio weapons labs and level two facilities in major cities
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:25:00.320]  when before they would have them on isolated islands or in armored compounds uh i mean there's
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:05.520]  a method to this madness we know it's population reduction but even the elite's top servants
[2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:10.640]  are coming in contact from this and getting hurt by this uh what is this all part of
[2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:19.760]  it's uh well in canada they started to do this with these particular laboratories back in the
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:26.640]  late 80s early 90s and there was a hullabaloo from big cities like toronto as to why would you put
[2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:35.440]  such a laboratory with deadly diseases in the middle of a city and at the time of course
[2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:41.360]  speculation for some of us was that one day that's where they're going to release these deadly
[2:25:41.360 --> 2:25:47.360]  bacteria from it's the best place to have it the best place to do it right in the middle of
[2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:56.080]  the crowded city if the agenda is to depopulate and we know with agenda 21 and it's been really
[2:25:56.080 --> 2:26:02.880]  rushed ahead now to get everyone off the rural areas into the existing overcrowded cities for the
[2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:11.200]  masses and they will start pandemics once that they're all in there pandemics crop up every few
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:17.280]  years or die down crop up to a lot of people die down back and forth back and forth that way they
[2:26:17.280 --> 2:26:23.920]  can bury their dead and take care of the dead the elites won't do that for them and so we always
[2:26:23.920 --> 2:26:29.360]  bury our dead and there's evidence they engineered the spanish flu and and they admit blum island
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:36.000]  alone weaponized limes and what's killed now thousands uh the west niles admittedly from
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:41.280]  there released on purpose and uh and of course the the elite admit an official u.s. government policy
[2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:46.240]  they want to kill 80 plus percent of us memorandum 200 state department but but you're absolutely right
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:51.600]  alan nail in the head as usual uh this is what they're doing and see just like they've had the
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:56.560]  bio weapons experts release foot and mouth and other things important down the news even admits
[2:26:56.560 --> 2:27:02.400]  they're releasing it or a bio weapons guy releases the anthrax that's admitted then they try to blame
[2:27:02.400 --> 2:27:07.840]  a patsy and they have these dr eric pionkas everywhere who say kill 90 percent of us he gets
[2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:13.680]  a 95 percent standing ovation at the academy of sciences and the point is just like in in in 13
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:17.920]  monkeys they tell us what they're going to do they've got their guys when the order comes in
[2:27:17.920 --> 2:27:22.960]  they're just going to march in and release it in every major city they will uh and they want
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:28.480]  everyone packed into the city it's interesting too that once you're packed into these cities
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:34.000]  with the id cards coming up you'll also be restricted as to far you can travel
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:39.680]  out of that city very much to build soviet union system so you're literally going to be
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:46.560]  trapped within a city and if you look up the the nato booklet that's supposed to be available to
[2:27:46.560 --> 2:27:56.320]  every member of the public of the nato countries for bacterial and biological uh and uh atomic
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:28:03.280]  uh fallout on cities this is official it's been the same since 1970s and every nato country signed
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:10.240]  it the orders are in a documentary was done in britain on this the orders are that the troops
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:18.160]  have to contain everyone within that city any people trying to leave had to be shot on site
[2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:27.040]  these are present orders whole groups trying to leave the city have to be bombed from the air
[2:28:27.040 --> 2:28:34.480]  with cs gas and there'll be three cardons of rings around the city to try to trap everyone
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:40.000]  within it and the whole containment exercise will be to allow the people inside those cities to
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  gradually die and they've been doing chemical biological radiological lethal murdering us
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:51.840]  all over the western world for at least 75 years they've tested it all they tell us give up all your

[2:33:07.440 --> 2:33:11.120]  but that's what the elite are they're inbred they're mentally ill they're highly intelligent
[2:33:11.120 --> 2:33:15.120]  and they have all these compartmentalized elites working for them under them
[2:33:17.040 --> 2:33:22.480]  it's like specialized insects in a hive and when i say this i'm not trying to shock you it's the
[2:33:22.480 --> 2:33:29.840]  truth the government says they want a world government to carry out your orderly extermination
[2:33:29.840 --> 2:33:35.200]  and then the genetic engineering of the species into two subgroups a tiny group of servants
[2:33:35.200 --> 2:33:41.200]  and the elite the elite will enjoy the future the rest of us we won't our progeny our future
[2:33:41.200 --> 2:33:46.720]  it is the ultimate of selfishness uh and they are setting up the world as a hell pit now we
[2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:51.120]  told you you'd see them legalize wiretapping and no warrants we told you you'd see checkpoints we
[2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:56.080]  told you you'd see being blood being taken on the sides of the road for dna databases they're
[2:33:56.080 --> 2:34:00.800]  getting you ready under the name of dwi they're rubric uh we told you everything because we have
[2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:07.600]  the ram corporation we have the british ministry of defense plans we have i just had dr dug rocky on
[2:34:07.600 --> 2:34:13.680]  who was high-level army who worked for martial law now we have pdds now the white house says
[2:34:13.680 --> 2:34:20.320]  they're doing it but this was decades ago this is all a giant plan they own the banks they
[2:34:20.320 --> 2:34:27.520]  print the money they want power and as ellen watt just rightly said world war three is going it is
[2:34:27.520 --> 2:34:36.000]  against you and the few quote rogue nations not controlled by the new world order and uh i mean
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:42.400]  the incredible thing is i i even forget about this stuff i remember i want to ask alan about this
[2:34:42.400 --> 2:34:50.320]  in 2000 the army was in town they used a fake nuclear spell as their cover they shut down i35
[2:34:50.320 --> 2:34:54.800]  then they had army driving around downtown and playing clothes we have people inside the apd
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:34:59.840]  they told us about it we got down there and got footage austin police collapsed there was some type
[2:34:59.840 --> 2:35:06.080]  of gas downtown uh i thought it was a fake drill later i was told by sources no it was real they
[2:35:06.080 --> 2:35:12.320]  said watch again then the dps collapsed shut down the building uh they were going to the hospital
[2:35:13.280 --> 2:35:17.680]  more than 30 people at the hospital there they did bio test chemical test here we're not sure what it
[2:35:17.680 --> 2:35:23.680]  was the point is i don't have to go down the road to find checkpoints taken by blood without warrants
[2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:29.920]  or cops collapsing why do they revel alan in hurting their own military and police and then
[2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:34.720]  how did they psychologically brainwash the military and police to enjoy being hurt by
[2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:38.960]  their masters i mean i know a lot of people listening are going to die with your children
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:44.000]  still loving the government who we're listening right now alan what we've got is a
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:54.720]  a psychopath rule over people they give you a psychopathic culture and they've bred a whole
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:36:04.240]  generation with a declining culture into uh immorality uh degeneracy and so on the state
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:11.360]  has given the new values to those who've been growing up over the last 20 25 years they wanted
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:19.120]  a militarized um people for for now so they created it they went to work giving them video games
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:24.320]  designed for the military they debased the culture at the same time music went down all the arts
[2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:31.120]  went downhill nihilistic type art which the cia have actually declassified their documents they
[2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:35.360]  were behind a lot of this and actually paid the artist to do all this nihilistic art and so on
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:42.080]  so you have to degenerate people who basically have adopted a psychopathic type culture
[2:36:42.640 --> 2:36:48.720]  and our psychopath will give allegiance to his master we saw a classic example was the
[2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:55.920]  nuremberg trials with hitlers followers who to to the end talked about hitler as a god
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:37:01.040]  he was superior to them they worshiped those well that's why hitler and stalin hired felons
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:06.720]  and rapists aggravated felons violent felons out of the prisons because they actually enjoy
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:13.120]  following orders and serving evil they enjoy it and they also because you see the system in a
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:21.040]  psychopathic structure which is militarized is sadomasochistic so each person has praises the
[2:37:21.040 --> 2:37:27.840]  person above them with more power than themselves the officer above him tends to despise the ones
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:33.440]  beneath them the inferior ranks and that is sadomasochism yeah let me stop you i've noticed
[2:37:33.440 --> 2:37:38.160]  that a lot of these evil people actually in person admire me they say well we're your enemy but we
[2:37:38.160 --> 2:37:43.760]  admire you because you have power and it's totally sick they even admire us alan the admire power
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:50.560]  and that again is a sadomasochistic mentality they do admire power absolutely well keep going
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:55.680]  with your psychology and as i see that they also despise the weak that's something else because
[2:37:55.680 --> 2:38:02.160]  of sadomasochistic and they're very cruel to the weak beneath them you'll always find that in such
[2:38:02.160 --> 2:38:08.880]  societies when they've been militarized and we have been militarized when i saw the troops going in
[2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:16.800]  to the first gulf war and they showed you a bunch of marines on board a us carrier doing rap music
[2:38:16.800 --> 2:38:22.880]  stripped off and you heard this noise this incredible noise going across the ocean
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:29.440]  and these men jumping it up and down like something that you'd have seen in africa 500 years ago
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:35.040]  i said we're sending in the barbarians to one of the oldest civilizations in the world
[2:38:36.400 --> 2:38:42.800]  we had created a degenerate generation for this particular time in history that's right they've
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:48.880]  sold us that skulls and death and murder and craziness is fun when really the most vicious
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:54.000]  civilizations became civilized because they realized the great danger of barbarism and
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:39:00.000]  knew that it the the the the veneer of civilization was incredibly thin and once that stripped away
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:06.960]  hell is released absolutely and that's what we have now and we have people who have a generation
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:13.040]  relief where very few people have two parents uh veteran russell and many others spoke about
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:19.760]  this it was necessary to destroy the family the state would become the boss and the new father
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:24.960]  and it has been a when these young men who often don't have a father figure are brought into the
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:30.160]  military suddenly for the first time they belong just the same as the studies that they found on
[2:39:30.160 --> 2:39:36.800]  gangs young people who are who have one parent families will join the gang because it's it's
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:42.080]  uh it's the nearest thing to the father he gets protection from exactly in fact i've seen studies
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:49.040]  most of the thug cops were single parent they were into drugs and crime they became bullies
[2:39:49.040 --> 2:39:55.040]  they're not real men they think abusing little people is strength yes that's right and so we
[2:39:55.040 --> 2:39:59.600]  joined the military you're told you're special every country does the same thing you're special
[2:39:59.600 --> 2:40:06.960]  you're not a civilian now a civilian is a derogatory term and the bonding process is a
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:12.000]  scientific process in the military and suddenly they belong to something for the first time in
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:17.680]  their lives the new brothers are all around them wearing the same gear as they do their enemies
[2:40:17.680 --> 2:40:24.320]  are everyone else who's not wearing that same gear that uniform that one form and so it feels
[2:40:24.320 --> 2:40:29.280]  secure for the first time in their life and they're being taken care of and they're given power
[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:37.840]  it's also the only area where a male in this society is allowed to to show off aggression
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:44.560]  and be rewarded that's right all other true male art types they're healthy the leader of the home
[2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:50.800]  a hard worker that's all suppressed you're only allowed in a in a mutated form to exercise it
[2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:56.560]  within the uniform or at a mindless sports game acting like a fool anywhere else it is
[2:40:56.560 --> 2:41:02.960]  not allowed and as they commit crimes against the population as they abuse and humiliate the
[2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:09.040]  population that forms resistance which then further compacts the gang into their gang psychology
[2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:16.560]  of sea the outsider is against you that's right that is right so this is this is a very old plan
[2:41:16.560 --> 2:41:22.960]  and you know a lot of this came from Plato's republic Plato's republic talked about the
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:29.040]  new world order he talked about ongoing revolution and Caesar wrote about how to manipulate his own
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:36.000]  troops yes and that's why Kissinger in his own book can call you dumb animals to be used by them
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:42.320]  and you go yes i'm a dumb animal oh god nerve gas me kill me i love you kissinger that's right
[2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:47.040]  he called the american troops dumb stupid animals to be used for foreign policy
[2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:53.600]  yeah and a foreign policy which they did not understand never would and and actually they
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:42:00.480]  don't care to understand as long as they get to act macho and tough well they've been brought up
[2:42:00.480 --> 2:42:06.800]  with video games where they see cartoons with guys with big machine guns and weaponry and here
[2:42:06.800 --> 2:42:11.920]  they are they're given the real stuff and told to go off and kill in the in the killing fields
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:18.320]  and uh they're also drugged to mind you might tell you today lots of articles on the drugging
[2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:24.320]  off the troops and that also was put out in James magazine maybe 15 years ago that the future
[2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:31.680]  soldier would be heavily drugged so that he would not have retained memories of uh of the things
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:38.240]  that he'd done well the Pentagon admitted uh on in late 2001 right as they went to afghanistan
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:43.200]  it was called the marshal plan was the article in wired that the head future is mr marshal
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:47.520]  90 something years old at the time i don't know if he's still alive said in the future and he looks
[2:42:47.520 --> 2:42:51.680]  like alistair crownley he said in the future it'll be what drugs you're on uh what you know what your
[2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:57.840]  military and they admitted they were testing new drugs on the troops then and then it came out
[2:42:57.840 --> 2:43:02.640]  that member four delta force guys came back from one unit and murdered their women and children
[2:43:02.640 --> 2:43:06.400]  and of course it turned out that was a little test and then when the police would pull up at
[2:43:06.400 --> 2:43:11.040]  fort bragg they were just flopping on the ground foaming at the mouth and the news said oh that's
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:19.040]  quite normal to murder your children we also had canadian troops canada was given the largest
[2:43:19.040 --> 2:43:27.200]  doses of a new drug a substitute for uh quinine for malaria yeah that was it and some countries
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:34.000]  like france banned it because it was so neurotoxic and a documentary was done on the cbc on troops
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:41.760]  who came back and one young officer said that that his whole time there was like an lsd trip
[2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:48.400]  he was hallucinating every day they all were he was pulling his own pistol out and putting it
[2:43:48.400 --> 2:43:54.560]  at the head of children and of course that malaria story is just the cover uh there they uh it was
[2:43:54.560 --> 2:44:00.080]  like uh gruckheimer private gruckheimer told the ethical times yeah we go into villages and we line
[2:44:00.080 --> 2:44:04.000]  up all the women and children and murder them and then the army came out and said well we want to
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:08.960]  clarify that's only in some villages and then they and then they give them things like halcyon
[2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:14.880]  amnesics afterwards yes that's correct so they don't retain those nasty memories but eventually
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:20.720]  if they're demobbed they come back into society they start going crazy and uh there's no help
[2:44:20.720 --> 2:44:25.200]  then yeah well they've got your wife pulled over at 1 a.m when she's coming home from work that's
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:30.560]  when he's going to melt down yeah he's going to kill her right on the squad car video and nothing's
[2:44:30.560 --> 2:44:35.040]  going to happen and if you speak up a swat team's going to come by and they're going to murder you
[2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:40.640]  and the rest of your family because you're slaves now another part of this as well is not apart from
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:46.480]  this psychological damage and probably physical uh brain damage that's done with these drugs
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:54.080]  is the fact that during the vietnam war they recognize something and the same bunch remember
[2:44:54.080 --> 2:45:01.200]  who were helping behind the scenes and advisory capacities are in power today and some of them
[2:45:01.200 --> 2:45:08.320]  vowed never to let the vietnam era happen again in a future war now they were scared of troops
[2:45:08.320 --> 2:45:16.080]  coming back who were well coached in the military now defend themselves and and war tactics in case
[2:45:16.080 --> 2:45:24.240]  they would cause a revolution back home and it was decided that the early suggestion was put forward
[2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:30.160]  at very high level that if they could literally through inoculations and different means
[2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:36.880]  disable those soldiers after four years or so were up in other words diseases would kick in which
[2:45:36.880 --> 2:45:42.080]  would make them very very sick that would put them out of the category of being a future threat when
[2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:46.320]  brought back home within the country well that's what the vaccines are for they give them the
[2:45:46.320 --> 2:45:49.920]  questionnaire and this has even come out from high-level sources they give them a questionnaire
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:56.640]  and say will you fire on us citizens and the 75 on average that say no they then get the shot
[2:45:56.640 --> 2:46:01.920]  that soft kills them and and this is and then you're going to be dead in five ten years or or a
[2:46:01.920 --> 2:46:07.840]  vegetable and uh then the others that say yes they get promoted up and they get taken care of like
[2:46:07.840 --> 2:46:13.200]  good race horses and they don't get called for the special shots and that's correct so that given
[2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:21.040]  time delay uh diseases which will kick in once their usefulness in the military is over and they
[2:46:21.040 --> 2:46:27.760]  go downhill they may often commit suicide as well may have tripling diseases and terrible pain yes so
[2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:33.120]  lie and say you'll fire on us citizens but you've got to convince them or they're going to kill you
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:38.720]  go ahead yeah so this is all planned so those in the military are disposable and there's always
[2:46:38.720 --> 2:46:44.400]  another bunch next year at turning the right age to join to take their place they're renewable
[2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:49.680]  and disposable and because i'm 18 and i don't know what i want and they know you don't know what
[2:46:49.680 --> 2:46:56.960]  you want yeah that's right and if you're on sign up for two years to four years well after four
[2:46:56.960 --> 2:47:02.480]  years is up the darn good chance you wouldn't go home work for a couple of years and be stricken
[2:47:02.480 --> 2:47:08.240]  with some odd disease that's going to cripple you bring it down quickly and you have no threat as
[2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:12.640]  as a trained soldier back home when the country's going down the drain
[2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:21.760]  please continue alan well as i say everything is planned this way and often published that's the
[2:47:21.760 --> 2:47:26.880]  amazing thing about this new world order they do have their big players publish many many books
[2:47:26.880 --> 2:47:32.240]  with future scenarios because they have huge think tanks working on all aspects of society at all
[2:47:32.240 --> 2:47:40.400]  times and they do love to to print up and put out to the public the facts of their plan their brave
[2:47:40.400 --> 2:47:49.680]  new world scenario and now the future of society is a great huge society to undergo for many years
[2:47:49.680 --> 2:47:55.680]  that's where your mainstream authors are invited to attend to get the latest that may write stories
[2:47:55.680 --> 2:48:02.400]  around things which are going to happen in real life to familiarize the public and condition them
[2:48:02.400 --> 2:48:06.960]  that this is inevitable revelation of the method because their studies other behavioral psychologist
[2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:11.600]  studies as you know but for the audience know that even if something's a horrible thing if they've
[2:48:11.600 --> 2:48:15.520]  been introduced to it they will take it better and so that's why there were so many books and tv
[2:48:15.520 --> 2:48:19.760]  shows about the government's going to fly planes in the world trade center they're going to attack
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:25.680]  attack afghanistan they're going to use war games to cover it up and they told you we're going to do
[2:48:25.680 --> 2:48:31.280]  this and then i even had the x file guy on saying yes the cia came and told us to write these pieces
[2:48:31.280 --> 2:48:36.720]  and it's just letting us know it's like we did it and we're going to keep killing you okay yeah and
[2:48:36.720 --> 2:48:45.360]  i don't think people realize that everything in their culture is is guided all arts and entertainment
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:52.400]  and so on is guided that's now declassified from the cia they ran the culture industry
[2:48:53.600 --> 2:49:00.480]  in the u.s. they were allied with mi5 and britain and i've got all the the data here that's only
[2:49:00.480 --> 2:49:06.960]  recently been declassified the big bands the groups they funded the great artists they funded
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:12.320]  even the poets they funded to guide and shape the thoughts of those that followed the arts well
[2:49:12.320 --> 2:49:18.240]  there's a lady got a popular ron paul song out right now and she was signed uh four years ago
[2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:24.560]  by one of the biggest record companies and it's admitted the cia came to them and said uh no do
[2:49:24.560 --> 2:49:33.280]  not put this out yes mm-hmm so this is something you see when you read the communist writings of
[2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:43.760]  lenin lenin said at the beginning of the 1900s he said communism will not last for forever he says
[2:49:43.760 --> 2:49:54.240]  maybe 70 years he said then it will blend in to it's into the west it'll combine with capitalism
[2:49:54.240 --> 2:50:01.520]  and out of it will come a third way which again is the title of the book of alvin toffler who belongs
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:07.600]  to the future of society the the mentor of newt genridge who is not anything but a conservative
[2:50:08.400 --> 2:50:13.680]  yes and uh and lenin said that the system that would eventually transpire would be not quite
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:20.720]  capitalist not quite communist it would be a form of an elitist group at the top of fascist elitist
[2:50:20.720 --> 2:50:27.280]  group and a bureaucratic system run on the communist lines to take care of the masses
[2:50:27.280 --> 2:50:33.520]  and everyone would eventually be brought in to serve the world state that will be a duty to the

[2:54:17.840 --> 2:54:23.520]  eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one shifting gears you know i took rtf at the local
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:27.280]  college here in austin and i've read a lot of books about it and i'm familiar with the book the
[2:54:27.280 --> 2:54:32.480]  whorling dervisher about media control that erin dykes has got it right out the window out there
[2:54:32.480 --> 2:54:37.200]  he's reading it right now about cia control of the dominant media in the past they're losing control
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:44.640]  now so they're not invincible uh but i also am i want to get your take on the general public
[2:54:44.640 --> 2:54:50.720]  isn't aware that watching television puts them in a dream state i mean that's mainline science
[2:54:50.720 --> 2:54:55.680]  they think we're just saying that puts you in a dream state and so that's why i've seen studies
[2:54:55.680 --> 2:55:03.680]  a bunch of them 30 40 years ago they would do uh suggestibility uh you know hypnotism test
[2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:10.720]  universities and they found about 25 percent on average could be highly suggestible and that was
[2:55:10.720 --> 2:55:15.440]  always the number books were written by hypnotist and by magicians and you can see it if you go on
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:19.280]  a cruise you go to los vegas you know they'll they'll get a hundred people out of the audience
[2:55:19.280 --> 2:55:24.000]  and only picked under 15 but now they're finding when they have these tv shows where the guy can
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:28.240]  make somebody give them their wallet on the street or he could hypnotize people to go try to rob an
[2:55:28.240 --> 2:55:34.400]  armored car uh or to or to jump in a river and it's really happening and now they're finding
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:41.520]  around 60 of people will do it well that's because they're zombies they're never awake anymore and
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:45.600]  sometimes you can even see them kind of wake up when you're warning them you know out on the street
[2:55:45.600 --> 2:55:50.720]  or you see somebody uh you hadn't seen in a while and and you'll see them kind of break out of it
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:56.400]  and i don't think the public realizes those that that are awake just how you know we joke and say
[2:55:56.400 --> 2:56:01.920]  they're sheep they're zombies no they're really are zombies alan they are zombies there's no
[2:56:01.920 --> 2:56:07.920]  doubt about it they're they're they've they've never really been conscious to be honest with you
[2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:14.400]  they've been raised and weaned on television the baby they've been babysat with television
[2:56:14.400 --> 2:56:20.000]  from major toddlers and if you even look at the what they're being shown as toddlers
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:24.160]  you'll see all the political correctness there that child's going to experience in their lifetime
[2:56:24.160 --> 2:56:29.440]  all the greening stuff is in the cartoons the save the world stuff is in the cartoons
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:35.200]  the messages off too many people is in the cartoons and so uh but they've been raised
[2:56:35.200 --> 2:56:42.560]  like that not to be conscious at all and brisinski who really specialized in certain areas of the
[2:56:42.560 --> 2:56:51.440]  human mind on the mass level talked about that in his own book um between two ages and he said in
[2:56:51.440 --> 2:56:58.080]  there that um shortly the public will be unable to think for themselves through scientific technique
[2:56:58.800 --> 2:57:04.000]  and he said all they'll be able to do is repeat what was on the previous night's news to each other
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:10.960]  on the following day at work he said they will expect the media to do the reasoning for them
[2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:16.560]  and that has happened it's been very successful the average person truly believes the media
[2:57:16.560 --> 2:57:21.280]  is an extension of their own brain and it will warn them about things that they should know
[2:57:21.920 --> 2:57:27.200]  they don't stop and even question what is the media are they but the fact that they're private
[2:57:27.200 --> 2:57:34.880]  organizations and they have tremendous power to mislead you if they so wish now only 50 years ago
[2:57:34.880 --> 2:57:40.080]  people in all countries were very suspicious of media they knew that they were owned by big
[2:57:40.080 --> 2:57:48.000]  business tycoons who are generally related to royalty or whatever and um and and and big magnets
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:53.840]  and they knew that it was propaganda outlets that's what media was for propaganda media
[2:57:53.840 --> 2:58:01.120]  is an essential arm of government that's its purpose it gives us a reality through whatever
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:06.480]  information it decides we're supposed to know even if it's false i want to talk more about that when
[2:58:06.480 --> 2:58:12.480]  we get back and how to break people out of this mesmerized condition but as you said from bertha
[2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:18.480]  raised in it to where the neural pathways develop and these are major studies of the brain and the
[2:58:18.480 --> 2:58:25.040]  television with children actually brain damages them it it it lessens their future potential we'll
[2:58:25.040 --> 2:58:37.840]  be right back thank you for listening to gcn be sure to visit gcnlive.com today our beloved republic

[2:59:44.880 --> 3:00:07.680]  it is the 10th day of july 2008 ellen want for us for another 60 minutes your calls coming up the
[3:00:07.680 --> 3:00:18.000]  next segment elliott steve scott lani pete and many others 1-800-259-9231 i thought i'd have
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:23.600]  ellen want on and not just hog him for myself but uh let you talk to him we always enjoy your phone
[3:00:23.600 --> 3:00:28.880]  calls hearing the different topics the grab bag of issues you bring up ellen more and more our
[3:00:28.880 --> 3:00:35.840]  allies that we can't stress enough that the elite have created a system to mesmerize the public
[3:00:35.840 --> 3:00:41.600]  and to put them into a dream state i mean the electrodes the the the ekg show that that's a
[3:00:41.600 --> 3:00:46.240]  fact that's taught in basic media but the public doesn't even know that exists i mean here's a
[3:00:46.240 --> 3:00:50.880]  basic they'll have six video screens behind somebody on seeing it and they'll have a scroll
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:56.400]  at the bottom and they'll have a blue mist in the corner and i mean in basic and there's different
[3:00:56.400 --> 3:01:00.240]  layers of propaganda as you know i want you to speak to this we're just going to skip through
[3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:04.400]  some of the breaks here for the info wars dot com listeners and prisonplanet.tv viewers it's
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:08.960]  too important i want to let you run with this before we take calls ellen uh but just one
[3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:15.520]  layer of the of the uh hypnotism the mesmerize uh mesmerization of the population this is in
[3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:21.680]  textbooks is you'll have eight nine different forms of data different video feeds different
[3:01:21.680 --> 3:01:26.640]  things on one screen and your conscious mind can't track it all but your subconscious can't
[3:01:26.640 --> 3:01:31.520]  so it immediately for you to be able to even grasp that you are instantly brought into a
[3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:38.240]  subconscious mode then you have the tv flicker rate uh you have uh then the overt propaganda of
[3:01:38.240 --> 3:01:43.120]  how they're twisting semantically what they're saying what they're doing and you put that all
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:48.960]  together i mean i will become mesmerized in a few minutes uh and that's why i don't watch hardly
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:54.800]  any television i will listen to it like a radio and then it's just annoying hearing the semantical
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:59.760]  propaganda and so i want people to know i mean it's we don't just say that video games put you
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:06.160]  into a lower than dream state and a natural state of oxygen starved narcosis that's major studies
[3:02:06.160 --> 3:02:11.600]  just type that uh you know long play video games mimic death in the brain that's a mainline story
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:17.840]  about it and and but but i believe seeing the elite themselves that they were not immune to this
[3:02:17.840 --> 3:02:24.400]  that that there is a group consciousness wherever you want to call it a feedback loop their cultural
[3:02:24.400 --> 3:02:28.720]  interactions whatever you want to say they're watching tv too and i believe the elite have
[3:02:28.720 --> 3:02:33.360]  been caught in their own trap and that now not they're not just tearing down our intellects
[3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:37.760]  they're tearing down their own and that it looks like humanity's caught in a black hole
[3:02:37.760 --> 3:02:44.000]  intellectual uh vortex and that we are being dehumanized and it looks like the elite themselves
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:53.920]  have uh basically fallen into their own pit well it's possible and what is true absolutely is that
[3:02:53.920 --> 3:03:01.200]  we we have been dehumanized as i say war has declared a long time ago on the ordinary people
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:08.080]  and to bring us down to a very base type society where we wouldn't mind what was done to us next
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:14.160]  once you get to a certain level and morality is stripped and the norms are gone the norms
[3:03:14.160 --> 3:03:19.920]  safeguarded society are gone and there's no cohesion between society in a me generation
[3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:27.600]  their egos and uh uh tonic and behavior the egocentric their narcissistic that's exactly
[3:03:27.600 --> 3:03:32.960]  what Bertrand Russell said they would do to society then there's no cohesion cohesion is
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:38.080]  actually a survival mechanism and when it's gone the government then can dictate right
[3:03:38.080 --> 3:03:44.720]  down to the individual with no one standing up for that individual just like George Orwell's 1984
[3:03:44.720 --> 3:03:51.440]  all done uh by design but when you when you also strip all that which is beautiful and
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:58.560]  necessary for a healthy human psyche and you replace it with with stuff which is very debasing
[3:03:58.560 --> 3:04:04.000]  everything is very debasing uh well they're now replacing even beautiful women are getting into
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:11.680]  it uh ugliness death sickening things next to beautiful things uh to transfer is over into
[3:04:11.680 --> 3:04:20.960]  thinking uh the gross is beautiful we've we've watched and again the cia funded this uh fetuses
[3:04:20.960 --> 3:04:28.320]  put into jars of urine and put on display in museums and art galleries we're seeing corpses
[3:04:28.320 --> 3:04:34.800]  dried out late corpses strong on wires they're touring the us right now and people are going
[3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:40.240]  in to pay to watch these corpses hanging on wires and protest positions and that's just the public
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:45.360]  being trained for their extermination to think it's beautiful that's correct and on september 11
[3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:51.360]  2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops i went to grounds here and we knew what to do
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:57.280]  or at least we thought we did truth rising is a breakthrough 9 11 film that finally gives first
[3:04:57.280 --> 3:05:05.520]  responders a platform to tell their story widman epa director on the 18 made a statement

[3:07:49.840 --> 3:08:02.160]  network listeners out there we just skipped that last break president planet dot tv viewers had a
[3:08:02.160 --> 3:08:07.040]  chance to hear it and see it we were talking about how the elite aren't replacing everything with
[3:08:07.040 --> 3:08:12.640]  death and destruction not just to neutralize the public and to uh you know because we love death
[3:08:12.640 --> 3:08:18.480]  you won't stand up for your neighbor when they're kidnapping their kids uh with cps uh or when the
[3:08:18.480 --> 3:08:23.200]  swat team's murdering you you know it's a good thing but also because the elite think that's
[3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:28.080]  beautiful you know they think that's great uh and alan was finishing up talking about that then i
[3:08:28.080 --> 3:08:34.240]  wanted uh with him to get into the carbon tax how they want to use that as this global umbrella
[3:08:34.240 --> 3:08:39.440]  with social workers to micromanage every level of our lives how in england and now in the us
[3:08:39.440 --> 3:08:43.760]  they want licenses for parents if you want to hug your child in public you'll be arrested for
[3:08:43.760 --> 3:08:51.200]  pedophilia um major papers reporting toddlers who dislike spicy food are racist the police are called
[3:08:51.200 --> 3:08:58.080]  they feed a two three-year-old hot curry uh they if they say yuck they're then put in in in a criminal
[3:08:58.080 --> 3:09:04.080]  database for life this is i mean making all normal behavior criminal uh and it's meant to be insane
[3:09:04.080 --> 3:09:08.640]  meant to sound crazy to push all barriers to end all barriers but let's quickly because i want to
[3:09:08.640 --> 3:09:13.920]  go to calls alan and love picking your brain here uh just great talking to you let's go back here
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:19.840]  and uh finish up with this love of death selling us on like you know sorts and anger loves art of
[3:09:19.840 --> 3:09:27.200]  dead babies um you know i i talk about seeing a pbs with kivorkian with his art demons eating babies
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:32.640]  and this runs through the elite when i was at the hotel where the billerberg group was meeting the
[3:09:32.640 --> 3:09:37.680]  day before they got there the paintings were of children rich children with black circles around
[3:09:37.680 --> 3:09:42.720]  their eyes that looked dead and it was like this is like a joke out of a horror movie like some crazy
[3:09:42.720 --> 3:09:48.000]  hotel would have but but see that's beautiful dead children and that's basically what they were
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:53.200]  dead children dressed up with their eyes open on the walls and i got video of this that's beautiful
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:10:00.320]  to them you know pale skin uh big black circles uh the uh the uh gums pulled back from around the
[3:10:00.320 --> 3:10:07.200]  teeth uh basically pictures of dead little girls that's beautiful to them isn't it alan it is and
[3:10:07.200 --> 3:10:13.840]  that's when you you really have to wonder what is in these people uh we use the term psychopath
[3:10:13.840 --> 3:10:20.480]  because it's the easiest way to describe them in today's society um we are living in a society today
[3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:27.280]  that is very very confused um people are trying to wake up all to be misled by very well trained
[3:10:27.280 --> 3:10:35.200]  pipe pipers all over the globe but if you come back to this odd phenomenon of of what is in these
[3:10:35.200 --> 3:10:45.520]  people um they're demonically possessed in some way uh there's certainly um as i say psychopathy
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:52.960]  simply gives you a scientific explanation of symptoms which which were used to be called
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:58.880]  demonically possessed in other words utterly evil and at least in days gone by people could
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:06.640]  recognize what evil was today in an age of moral relativism they think that anything goes
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:12.560]  anything is okay it's all different opinions uses as good as mine etc so we're living with all this
[3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:18.880]  open evil manifesting as i say with even dead corpses on display for art to make it money
[3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:27.760]  we we see that that the abortion industry is rampant across the planet um they're now making
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:34.400]  cbc movies with taxpayers money on the man at morgan taller who started the abortion industry
[3:11:34.400 --> 3:11:42.320]  in canada is now a hero just like kinsey was elevated to be a hero a man with incredible sexual
[3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:48.160]  perversions himself he also murdered his son he murdered yeah and blacks about it so we murdered
[3:11:48.160 --> 3:11:54.880]  his son how beautiful he starved in the death of a torture chamber oh my god it's so good
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:12:02.720]  good and kinsey himself who literally changed the sexual morality of of men and women because
[3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:07.600]  that people read these books and thought well jeez if these are normal men and women i'm missing
[3:12:07.600 --> 3:12:13.920]  out somewhere i'm not so promiscuous and so it was to guide the society and to hyper promiscuity
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:18.560]  which again me knew would help destroy the family units you wouldn't need family use they would
[3:12:18.560 --> 3:12:22.080]  they would die well you wouldn't be satisfied either within then of course you find out really
[3:12:22.080 --> 3:12:31.680]  how unhappy you are uh getting back to this whole culture of death uh i mean is there any way out
[3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:36.240]  of this alan i mean on the good side how do you see things unfolding on the bad side how do you
[3:12:36.240 --> 3:12:42.560]  see things unfolding those i've always said this those who are not teenagers anymore
[3:12:43.360 --> 3:12:47.120]  and who can still think and who've done their homework and really gone into all this and
[3:12:47.120 --> 3:12:53.680]  studied it well we're the last generation that can verbalize this to anyone the youth growing up
[3:12:53.680 --> 3:12:58.880]  have had more intense conditioning than any previous generation they've had more shots
[3:12:58.880 --> 3:13:05.680]  inoculations than anybody before them and they're they're they're kind of damaged so it's up to those
[3:13:05.680 --> 3:13:14.000]  us that we who are conscious today in society to do this battle is all up to us and i say that if
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:22.720]  we can regain we can regain our natural humanity and our humanitarian instincts bring them back
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:28.720]  into play because that's what's been under attack all these years that's what makes us truly human
[3:13:28.720 --> 3:13:35.920]  which is a survival mechanism for us all if we can bring that back and stop being so selfish the
[3:13:35.920 --> 3:13:43.840]  me generation the the ego centonic narcissistic generation then we have a chance if we don't if
[3:13:43.840 --> 3:13:50.720]  we go along with this this me first and you're cut off from everyone else will all go down together
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:55.520]  and to be clear i agree with you and let's get into what's going to happen on the bad side of
[3:13:55.520 --> 3:14:02.400]  we can't what the choice here is uh the different roman historians wrote about it pro and con that
[3:14:02.400 --> 3:14:06.480]  that you had the and as the empire got more and more corrupt fell apart more and more got more
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:10.960]  and more abusive they would have more and more games until it was wasn't just once a month it
[3:14:10.960 --> 3:14:16.560]  was once a week then it was five times a day and even though you might be thrown in with the lions
[3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:22.320]  next week or your child might be it didn't matter because narcissistically you could go
[3:14:22.320 --> 3:14:28.160]  shit in the bleachers next to the emperor next to the caesar and you could see people being torn
[3:14:28.160 --> 3:14:34.880]  apart and it's a narcissistic power trip to see those dead chinese dissidents on display and laugh
[3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:42.080]  at them or to see human bodies dried on wires and giggle and snicker and ooh it's it's it's you know
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:50.080]  and and and uh it's fun to see fetuses in in in containers of urine and laugh at the little human
[3:14:50.080 --> 3:14:56.320]  and laugh that i'm alive i'm doing good uh you know and so what's happening again is they are
[3:14:56.320 --> 3:15:03.760]  glamorizing each individual being cornered and having our guts ripped out so the system so we
[3:15:03.760 --> 3:15:09.200]  don't have instincts to defend ourselves individually or others and so we think we're saving ourselves
[3:15:09.200 --> 3:15:13.600]  by not caring about anybody the yuppies always have that attitude and laugh at you well i'm
[3:15:13.600 --> 3:15:18.960]  doing fine when really their own defense mechanism by not caring for others well they don't care
[3:15:18.960 --> 3:15:25.280]  about you either you're now shields wide open absolutely absolutely the only defense we have
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:34.640]  is to retain our natural humanity and our natural our natural abhorrence to see humanity debased
[3:15:35.840 --> 3:15:43.440]  and put into jars of urine uh one time you know life was regarded as sacred and this is nothing
[3:15:43.440 --> 3:15:50.000]  to do what i'm about to say with with the pro and against abortion but i knew when abortion came
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:57.040]  along the real intent was was to debase society and to devalue human life all human life and that's
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:02.560]  what the entire green movement's about and let me be clear listen to me environmentalist it is
[3:16:02.560 --> 3:16:06.720]  natural to care about your environment it is natural to want to have clean air and water
[3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:13.360]  but the globalists are viciously as fast as they can destroying the human uh genome the the the
[3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:20.400]  world's uh genome the true biosphere toxic waste radiation super weapons everywhere and then they
[3:16:20.400 --> 3:16:27.680]  give you the fake system of let's tax what animals put off carbon dioxide that is a life gas total
[3:16:27.680 --> 3:16:33.280]  fraud to train you that humans are bad and that's what they teach they teach in all the public
[3:16:33.280 --> 3:16:38.320]  schools that there's too many of us we must die they have the kids play lifeboat and spaceship and
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:42.720]  that there's only enough room for five six people in the lifeboat four of us have to die who's
[3:16:42.720 --> 3:16:48.640]  gonna die then the captain decides who dies i.e. government decides who dies i mean this is so
[3:16:48.640 --> 3:16:54.960]  diabolical folks what he's saying they are taking your they are teaching you that your life force
[3:16:54.960 --> 3:17:02.960]  prime directive for the species is a is a bad thing when it is the the fulcrum of exploration
[3:17:02.960 --> 3:17:10.000]  and creativity and what humanity is it is a direct assault on the species life force not
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:15.920]  just the individual i want that's right and what the the the the example you gave there about the
[3:17:15.920 --> 3:17:24.320]  lifeboat everyone who is chosen to die is chosen to die in order of less importance to society
[3:17:24.320 --> 3:17:28.400]  which is exactly what we're talking about for the future societies and their sustainable
[3:17:28.400 --> 3:17:35.360]  development campaigns uh who is uh necessary to keep alive to serve society and who is the
[3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:43.120]  useless eater and it all starts with a on your car what uh what bio credit it has what score in
[3:17:43.120 --> 3:17:52.960]  footprint it has we're all being taught we're on a ration now yes and so when we begin to to accept
[3:17:52.960 --> 3:17:58.560]  that oh yeah they're just i guess it is too many offers were useless and the victims it is about
[3:17:58.560 --> 3:18:06.000]  mocking the victim and in this occult system which is a religion at the top which is also a science
[3:18:07.280 --> 3:18:15.040]  they must get the victim to accept his own death it's like george orwell at the end
[3:18:15.040 --> 3:18:20.320]  after all the torturing he becomes he comes to love big brother he wants to be killed in fact
[3:18:20.320 --> 3:18:25.600]  he's at the chestnut cafe and and and he's hearing the bs media report about another fake war
[3:18:25.600 --> 3:18:30.480]  when it's really a global government he just says i love big brother he cries just like the cops
[3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:36.160]  being nerve-gassed and bio weapon the military being killed they love it yes kill me kill me
[3:18:36.160 --> 3:18:42.640]  government i love you and that's the occult technique where they're now bringing a society around
[3:18:43.760 --> 3:18:50.480]  that already have accepted that life has no real value there's too many people useless eaters
[3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:55.840]  even people in the working class are bombarded with these nature shows and so on and hear the same
[3:18:55.840 --> 3:19:01.760]  messages over every show humans are bad get the humans humans are bad and and so they are having
[3:19:01.760 --> 3:19:07.040]  their minds altered gradually but yeah i guess you know they'll have to eventually start killing
[3:19:07.040 --> 3:19:13.760]  us off and so the victim agrees to his own execute and by the way alan as you're saying exactly
[3:19:13.760 --> 3:19:18.640]  everyone you talk to i mean they're like well of course we we have to kill humans of course we
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:23.040]  have to die okay they did create age but there's too many of us and i'm like hey you little dumb
[3:19:23.040 --> 3:19:28.880]  yuppie bastard yeah they're putting cancer viruses in your vaccines you idiot when you're dying of

[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:29.520]  up our game the world's a big complex place it and i every day i'm told you can do this you need
[3:26:29.520 --> 3:26:36.000]  to do that i'm doing look folks you want to do something get in game get terror storm get uh
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:41.120]  truth rising make five thousand copies i know they're wealthy people listening right now uh you

[3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:51.600]  watt cds give them to people tell them about this radio show that's how we've had the effect
[3:26:51.600 --> 3:26:57.040]  i mean the good news is we had oh i guess uh you know fifty sixty percent of people a few
[3:26:57.040 --> 3:27:01.440]  years ago supporting government now it's less than ten percent we are discrediting them but
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:07.280]  you can't expect us to do it all alan and that's true when people have to start i'm not kidding
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:13.920]  but very quickly saying no to the obtusions that are coming into their lives through the
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:19.600]  ridiculousness of this bend down and expose yourself at the checkpoints and all the rest of it
[3:27:19.600 --> 3:27:26.800]  we've got to as i say regain our humanity our self-respect we've got to take it back very quickly
[3:27:26.800 --> 3:27:33.280]  because we adapt to the species very very easily and and very quickly into the new systems we can't
[3:27:33.280 --> 3:27:40.000]  allow this to go on any longer until the abnormal is now normal and we're completely dehumanized
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:46.720]  exactly we have to folks the solution is you literally handing out pamphlets and and films to
[3:27:46.720 --> 3:27:52.000]  everybody uh once a week in your neighborhood the the the answer is posters everywhere saying
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:56.320]  something's wrong america's a police state the answer is banner hangs the answer is calling
[3:27:56.320 --> 3:28:01.600]  to talk radio i mean folks i work eighteen hours a day uh lately i haven't been i've cut back a
[3:28:01.600 --> 3:28:05.200]  bit because i want to spend time with my family i'm only working about ten a day right now i mean
[3:28:05.200 --> 3:28:11.040]  let's see you activate like an alan water and alex jones i mean let's see you spend five hours a day
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:15.120]  instead of telling us what we need to do and i'm not mad at you i'm just talking straight to you
[3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:19.840]  the the solutions in the mirror folks the solution is in the mirror let's go ahead and talk to
[3:28:19.840 --> 3:28:27.040]  steven colorado you're on the air alan yeah it sounds rather alex like you're pretty well
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:32.960]  maxed out already so uh but anyway um you know you had mentioned about uh people not thinking

[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:55.920]  and that's a perfect example right there of how they just want to want you to trust their trust
[3:28:55.920 --> 3:29:02.240]  the radio uh talk show hosts so but anyway i had three questions first of all um you had

[3:33:09.920 --> 3:33:16.240]  his website i get some of his books and videos excellent stuff alan flesh out how the sociologist
[3:33:16.240 --> 3:33:21.600]  and top propagandist admit all the cop shows are brainwashing tools and then i use the example of
[3:33:21.600 --> 3:33:26.240]  on the show cops they only show you the white trash scum who's guilty they're always look like
[3:33:26.800 --> 3:33:32.080]  hell the cops are good guys always get their man the images the public's white trash degenerates
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:37.680]  scum the police are gods and angels and it's admitted total propaganda brainwashes meanwhile
[3:33:37.680 --> 3:33:42.000]  the government ships in the narcotics runs all the major black ops but the public still is
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:52.000]  bombarded with that false image yes and britain led this field of using fiction and drama to alter
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:58.080]  the perceptions of people to accept authority figures and actually elevate them up into special
[3:33:58.080 --> 3:34:04.480]  positions of being almost superhuman as though these cops and the detectives and the dramas came
[3:34:04.480 --> 3:34:11.200]  from different booms and did it all out of altruistic intent and nothing is further from the truth
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:19.440]  police comprise a paramilitary army within countries whose job it is is to serve their bosses
[3:34:20.160 --> 3:34:25.920]  by any and every means possible and they will obey any order they are given this has been proven
[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:31.040]  time after time when companies have been embedded in the past best exactly i want you to talk about
[3:34:31.040 --> 3:34:38.160]  that the best example was the parish police chief of new orleans his mother was calling on the cell
[3:34:38.160 --> 3:34:43.600]  phone for five days in a nursing home flooded begging for help and even the police chief
[3:34:43.600 --> 3:34:48.800]  ordered by the feds even though he had jurisdiction let his mother died i mean and he cried about it
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:56.160]  but he his god was the feds the drug dealing child kidnapping feds his mother had to die
[3:34:57.040 --> 3:35:02.560]  yes and police i mean the law is another thing too we're trained through all these fictional
[3:35:02.560 --> 3:35:08.800]  dramas and movies where they give you a human story we get hooked on the human drama we identify
[3:35:08.800 --> 3:35:14.880]  with the characters and we're being brainwashed all through the movie and we forget to say
[3:35:14.880 --> 3:35:20.800]  that that police will enforce any law that comes along the pike they will do it and say
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:24.800]  they're just doing their job and if that means leading you to the wall to be shot that will
[3:35:24.800 --> 3:35:31.280]  be so as well that's been proven time after time after time we should not be worshiping people
[3:35:31.280 --> 3:35:37.600]  who are there to serve society and that's been forgotten all these institutions are supposed
[3:35:37.600 --> 3:35:43.520]  to be public servants and these institutions one crime they committed that has declassified
[3:35:43.520 --> 3:35:48.560]  a thousands in the same area was radiating four thousand three hundred and something
[3:35:48.560 --> 3:35:54.240]  atomic energy commission uh the federal government uh you know has all the documents i put links to
[3:35:54.240 --> 3:36:00.480]  it it's covered in uh endgame what is the endgame.com is a full bibliography we're a great volunteer
[3:36:00.480 --> 3:36:06.560]  put together where every claim we made is is right there imagine i mean the will the steel will to
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:12.000]  take four thousand three hundred and something in one program toddlers from their parents and
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:16.640]  murder them and those and those and those those those army doctors murdered those children one
[3:36:16.640 --> 3:36:23.120]  after the other and then they were promoted larger cadres and that's one one program of thousands
[3:36:23.120 --> 3:36:29.280]  but oh the government's good they wouldn't carry out nine eleven allen would they and that's it
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:36.720]  that's it um the amazing thing with even nine eleven is the fact they needed the event to happen
[3:36:36.720 --> 3:36:42.640]  in two thousand and one because two thousand one was one of the occultic years and after c clark
[3:36:42.640 --> 3:36:48.960]  brawley's novel in the sixties about two thousand and one and gave us an occultic story that people
[3:36:48.960 --> 3:36:54.000]  think was about space but it wasn't it was a masonic story if you follow it and something
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:58.640]  beautiful was going to happen something beautiful and that's the term that they still use at the
[3:36:58.640 --> 3:37:06.400]  top and in their big speeches and of course we saw the daddy bush um praised uh he talked with nine
[3:37:07.280 --> 3:37:13.440]  he mentioned that the coming new world order on september 11th 1990 and then we gave the following
[3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:21.040]  speech a year later same date on uh coming into view and it'd be a new world order under the rule
[3:37:21.040 --> 3:37:26.800]  of law law was going to be the big stick to help bring it in and then of course we had
[3:37:26.800 --> 3:37:33.280]  persinsky and others talking about the rule of law not the law of the jungle yep if we're successful
[3:37:33.280 --> 3:37:41.600]  and we will be yes and then you have uh the big player is talking about um apparel harbor event
[3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:47.360]  being necessary to moat the public behind them for a major war and bingo to get their wish that's
[3:37:47.360 --> 3:37:52.000]  what i wanted to ask you allen why do you think we know he's a cfr architect wrote the homeland
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:58.720]  security plan uh gary hard would publish a letter saying the u.s. government stages terror attacks
[3:37:58.720 --> 3:38:03.920]  i ran you better do what we say don't think because 80 percent of the public's against attacking you
[3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:08.640]  we won't we will stage a bench and then we went and interviewed him it's in the film uh we are
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:15.120]  changed it it's in the film uh the uh the new film i just released um that just now came out
[3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:20.000]  truth rising folks that needs to be gotten out to folks i mean it's a solution people that are asking
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:26.400]  and uh he just says yeah our government stages terror attacks and uh that's what i said i i mean
[3:38:26.400 --> 3:38:32.400]  now they're almost just saying it out in the open now why are they doing that because they're so
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:39.680]  arrogant as a psychopathic trait they live on ego psychopaths live on ego and they do love to
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:46.720]  to boast how they pulled off some real real fast a huge con they love to boast it's very hard for
[3:38:46.720 --> 3:38:53.120]  them to contain uh their cleverness to themselves they love to boast about how clever they are
[3:38:53.120 --> 3:39:00.080]  now gary heart also is on tape you probably have it right after 9 11 saying talking to the cfr
[3:39:00.640 --> 3:39:08.560]  and he says we can use this tragedy to our advantage to what his bush's father talked about
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:14.480]  and called the new world order so they use misfortunes which they also create but they also use other
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:21.360]  ones uh to to fall into their path they use all the great catastrophes to their advantage and
[3:39:21.360 --> 3:39:25.280]  they always believe when they tell the truth they have to add a lie bill clinton gary heart all of
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:33.120]  them always say president bush only said once knowing it was 244 times on tv in those four years
[3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:39.680]  clinton all of them say and and but and bush said my father only said once in a in an article
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:46.240]  well he's see they always add why do they say bush senior only said once that we were going
[3:39:46.240 --> 3:39:52.640]  to have a new world order why do they always just add a lie mm-hmm well they are number one they are
[3:39:52.640 --> 3:39:58.160]  born liars that that is a psychopathic trait as well that's why they go into politics and they
[3:39:58.160 --> 3:40:03.280]  like so well without blushing they do things even when their life scandals are exposed to
[3:40:03.280 --> 3:40:08.640]  the public they don't blush because a psychopath is pure ego he will defend his ego at all costs
[3:40:08.640 --> 3:40:15.280]  and they do it very successfully they're almost a separate species you know uh the psychopathic
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:21.760]  class especially the inbred type who've been born into wealthy families and the hyper on top
[3:40:21.760 --> 3:40:26.160]  the uh the uh hyper psychopath you know i i'm beginning to call them the hell force i think
[3:40:26.160 --> 3:40:31.680]  that's the best way the elite and their minions this throng of shikos with their fancy propaganda
[3:40:31.680 --> 3:40:37.360]  arms projecting i mean it's like a cloaking device they project happy clowns and friendly and
[3:40:37.360 --> 3:40:42.400]  and but it's just it's just buzz saws and death right behind that hologram and they're just chewing
[3:40:42.400 --> 3:40:47.200]  us up and i'm going good god i've been behind the hologram i've seen it but now they've even
[3:40:47.200 --> 3:40:52.400]  lowered the cloak and there's and now they're telling us buzz saws are love yes and we're
[3:40:52.400 --> 3:40:56.960]  going to remember two when when we're told right after 9 11 when romsford came on
[3:40:57.760 --> 3:41:04.560]  backed up by cheney and others and he said that this is a hundred years war now that was a legal
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:10.800]  statement to the public and this means it's a hundred years to go through the 30 years of riots
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:15.040]  which the department of defense has admitted to at the end of this hundred years they hope to have
[3:41:15.040 --> 3:41:20.480]  a new civilization that's right in fact they they believe in international and ancient law
[3:41:21.040 --> 3:41:25.920]  and and and commercial roman law so they always post it like in the newspaper that's why they had
[3:41:25.920 --> 3:41:30.720]  all those books and tv shows where the government hijacked jets and flies them in the world trade
[3:41:30.720 --> 3:41:36.320]  center to attack afghanistan and uses drills as a cover and they tell you and it's the same thing
[3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:40.720]  we're gonna have a hundred year war and then they give awards to professors that say they
[3:41:40.720 --> 3:41:45.760]  want to kill everybody and then give the professor access to bio weapons labs and then they say i've
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:50.880]  had a lead us you know at the capital and other events where i bumped into them uh come up and
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:55.520]  say alex they don't want your help we're going to kill them uh you know i mean you know you
[3:41:55.520 --> 3:41:59.360]  basically they don't want your help there's nothing they can do uh don't you understand
[3:41:59.360 --> 3:42:05.360]  they don't want your help you know that's who they are uh and and it's just so sick and at the end
[3:42:05.360 --> 3:42:12.000]  of this they hope to have their transhumanist society and uh don't have brought forth during
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:18.720]  this hundred years this new transgender transhumanist creature it'll serve them better and we'll get
[3:42:18.720 --> 3:42:24.320]  them no trouble won't need entertainment want no won't need to to be rewarded for what it does
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:31.440]  it'll be a easily programmed being right out of huxley's brave new worlds this is the plan the war
[3:42:31.440 --> 3:42:37.120]  isn't just about the middle east the war is on the cultures of every country on the planet to
[3:42:37.120 --> 3:42:44.640]  alter them all and to get us to accept us our own demise as the old man the old yesterday's man
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:49.520]  and as bad and corrupt as the muslim nations are not defending them they are angel kicks
[3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:55.600]  compared and so when our rand says great satan they are actively and incorrectly assessing
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:43:02.640]  what runs the west it's interesting that when they go to mecca they used to do two trips one
[3:43:02.640 --> 3:43:10.480]  to the the the kappa stone and after that they all go they all went to up until two years ago by the
[3:43:10.480 --> 3:43:17.040]  way uh and so they rebelled they took it to they they they then picked up stones and they
[3:43:17.040 --> 3:43:23.120]  stoned an egyptian old obelisk that was called the great satan and that was only removed two
[3:43:23.120 --> 3:43:26.800]  years ago under the pretext that some of the stones were bouncing back and hurting people
[3:43:27.520 --> 3:43:33.200]  but from ancient times that symbol which is high freemasonry and that's that's washington's monument
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:40.400]  as well was understood by the muslims is to represent the satanic system but now they're not
[3:43:40.400 --> 3:43:47.040]  allowed to throw rocks at it they must love it they actually that's right um so that all is
[3:43:47.040 --> 3:43:54.240]  given all ages for totalitarianism for an elitist system and for a fraternity a brotherhood who
[3:43:54.240 --> 3:44:00.880]  run the world and they understood that in those countries absolutely it's a big block the all
[3:44:00.880 --> 3:44:08.400]  seeing eye crushing the little person who is beneath it uh let's go back to the calls here
[3:44:08.400 --> 3:44:12.880]  let's talk to scott in arizona than elliot pete t and colin i want to get everybody go
[3:44:12.880 --> 3:44:20.640]  ahead scott you're on the air with alan watt hey alex alan um like my question is uh more
[3:44:20.640 --> 3:44:26.000]  directed towards like uh the elitist of course they don't control alex's show we get the true
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:31.760]  story on everything that's happening out there um but you got two media outlets out outside on the
[3:44:31.760 --> 3:44:38.560]  mainstream which cnn and fox news and you got two guys and those media outlets belong to cnn
[3:44:38.560 --> 3:44:44.560]  that would be going back and um blue dots who are the only ones that are uh and those media outlets
[3:44:44.560 --> 3:44:49.360]  that are talking about anything to do with like the north american union and stuff even alex put
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:54.880]  with him blue dogs in the film yeah but dollars dobs let me just let me just say to me dobs has
[3:44:54.880 --> 3:44:59.280]  his own contract and he steals for the war on drugs and a few other bad things but he's a pretty good
[3:44:59.280 --> 3:45:03.440]  guy please don't put him in the same grouping as glenn beck glenn beck will say we have to fight the
[3:45:03.440 --> 3:45:08.720]  new world order that means you know submitting the world government i mean i mean beck is really a
[3:45:08.720 --> 3:45:13.600]  monster but go ahead okay well we go good we'll put glenn beck aside but i just don't understand
[3:45:13.600 --> 3:45:17.920]  the leaps control both those media outlets and actually fox news talks and they don't have anybody
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:23.280]  like that but cnn does have those two guys they have to have the illusion they have to have the
[3:45:23.280 --> 3:45:31.200]  illusion that that they are fair and balanced uh you want to take that alan yes it's like um
[3:45:31.920 --> 3:45:35.360]  you see everything is fake in the world it's presented to the public because we think
[3:45:36.160 --> 3:45:40.160]  and the dialectic they always give they always give you two sides of a story and you'll pick
[3:45:40.160 --> 3:45:46.480]  one now become your opinion so i think it was professor anthony hudson when he was talking
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:52.480]  about these agencies and societies he said uh they'll the guys from the same club the same
[3:45:52.480 --> 3:45:58.640]  fraternity will be on opposite stations and appear to oppose each other this is standard
[3:45:58.640 --> 3:46:03.840]  technique we'd be in an average Joe will never think himself beyond that they appear to oppose
[3:46:03.840 --> 3:46:10.320]  each other and this is just a punch in judy show to give you this or that opinion but the key is
[3:46:10.320 --> 3:46:15.840]  it's always watered down you know they'll never tell you get involved take action educate others
[3:46:15.840 --> 3:46:20.480]  they'll never give you the larger forms of the new world order they'll just why is the president
[3:46:20.480 --> 3:46:26.640]  opening our borders he sure is dumb yeah yeah exactly to keep you stuck in the in the daily
[3:46:26.640 --> 3:46:31.920]  present loo dogs won't tell you exactly loo dogs won't tell you that bush is a puppet
[3:46:31.920 --> 3:46:36.480]  he'll still play into that control paradigm thank you scott elliott nohio go ahead gotta move quick
[3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:43.440]  here come on elliott yeah go ahead all right i got a question for you who was the biochemist

[3:48:38.960 --> 3:48:43.760]  you see the main intent is to get the whole new world order to tell a case system underway
[3:48:43.760 --> 3:48:48.800]  they don't really care if it begins to unwind it and it gets it's not loading it slows you
