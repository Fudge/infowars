[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:32.920]  thank you for joining us on this Thursday Worldwide Transmission it is the 24th
[00:32.920 --> 00:40.280]  day of October 2013 and we will open the phones up in this hour the second hour
[00:40.280 --> 00:45.400]  in the third hour we have John Perkins Confessions of Economic Hitman joining
[00:45.400 --> 00:51.640]  us to talk about the financial looting that is the global banking cartels new
[00:51.640 --> 01:00.720]  world order system and where it will lead us by design that said dealing with
[01:00.720 --> 01:04.560]  political correctness there's a story up on dredgerport.com we're gonna be
[01:04.560 --> 01:10.080]  talking about University Cowboys Indians and sombreros offensive for Halloween
[01:10.080 --> 01:15.520]  see they're not only gonna ban paper bags saying they're racist they're not
[01:15.520 --> 01:19.200]  only gonna say you can't call the Washington Redskins the Redskins once
[01:19.200 --> 01:22.400]  they get rid of things that you could argue could be offensive they move on
[01:22.400 --> 01:27.800]  to everything else until only what's prescribed by the establishment is
[01:27.800 --> 01:34.040]  authorized it's a total authoritarianism and look I know that you know this but
[01:34.040 --> 01:38.200]  the point is they know this these are not liberals these are
[01:38.200 --> 01:42.960]  authoritarians now if you want to forcibly inject Africans with shots that
[01:42.960 --> 01:47.560]  have sterilants in them that's liberal because you know they're black folks and
[01:47.560 --> 01:52.320]  subhuman need to be killed according to them that's liberal see so if you're
[01:52.320 --> 01:57.640]  Arnold Schwarzenegger who says you admire Hitler you get ADL awards but if
[01:57.640 --> 02:00.440]  you stand against the type of stuff Hitler promoted then you're a racist
[02:00.440 --> 02:03.960]  you understand and there's no need to even show the proof and by the way it's
[02:03.960 --> 02:09.080]  not even meaning that you even buy into it and believe it if you are an Asian
[02:09.080 --> 02:14.560]  group that wants to call themselves the slants a popular group who want to
[02:14.560 --> 02:22.680]  trademark that name meaning a term from chords in music and then I guess a pun
[02:22.680 --> 02:27.280]  as well then the trademark office will refuse it you no longer have free
[02:27.280 --> 02:34.320]  speech and they're coming now I looked into this last year and found out that
[02:34.320 --> 02:40.720]  indeed it is under the Obama umbrella with Michelle Obama the food commas are
[02:40.720 --> 02:46.000]  who says aspartame's good GMOs good nonorganics good pure sugars good
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.120]  artificial sweeteners good MSG good no everything that should be restricted in
[02:51.120 --> 02:59.400]  schools is forced in there and feds order school to ban packed lunches without
[02:59.400 --> 03:06.680]  doctors know this is in Virginia saying under orders from the federal program
[03:06.680 --> 03:11.640]  they receive word from federal programs preschool pretending to lunches from home
[03:11.640 --> 03:16.160]  you must get a doctor's note saying it's a special diet again it's just like
[03:16.160 --> 03:21.080]  vaccines there's no law you've got to take them with a line says there is say
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.520]  there is and then they get a doctor's note and the doctors are part of the
[03:25.520 --> 03:31.560]  crew now they won't issue it it's all about fraud this is a criminal system
[03:31.560 --> 03:35.160]  where if you do what you're told you keep the job in the system if you don't
[03:35.160 --> 03:37.960]  you're gone and now that it's a government-run system everybody's got
[03:37.960 --> 03:42.360]  to have a government or a corporately government-controlled a combine job and
[03:42.360 --> 03:46.960]  so then they take over I've got an article right here 49% of Americans it
[03:46.960 --> 03:53.640]  was 47 just a year ago 49% of Americans now get government benefits 82 million
[03:53.640 --> 04:00.720]  households on Medicaid and that is the plan they're going to get everybody but
[04:00.720 --> 04:05.080]  offshore banks above the law on the dole but remember Chicago schools first
[04:05.080 --> 04:08.880]  came out and said you can't pack your child lunch parents can't be trusted
[04:08.880 --> 04:11.680]  parents are bad they actually said parents you know don't make good choices
[04:11.680 --> 04:15.840]  and you look at the slop the schools pushing it's another big corporate
[04:15.840 --> 04:21.520]  dumping ground of all the bad salts and all the bad MSG and all the bad
[04:21.520 --> 04:26.200]  aspartame and the chocolate milk and and then they're not allowed to run at
[04:26.200 --> 04:30.000]  recess because they might get hurt and no dodgeball I mean this is a total
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.560]  prison and heaven forbid you bring a water gun to school you'll be arrested
[04:33.560 --> 04:37.200]  or now you pull the water gun in the street you're arrested I mean it's just
[04:37.200 --> 04:41.840]  it's a total prison and they've got juries will send you away for having a
[04:41.840 --> 04:44.560]  water gun on the street I mean it doesn't matter if no law was broken they'll just
[04:44.560 --> 04:49.000]  still send you to jail because they it's Pavlovia they like to cop to pat them on
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.080]  the head in the judge and pack the biggest prison population in the country
[04:52.080 --> 04:55.680]  and now all over the nation they're telling them you can't pack your child's
[04:55.680 --> 05:00.600]  lunch they're going to eat GMO swill but we got bigger news coming up financial

[08:37.520 --> 08:42.880]  Transmission the 24th day of October 2013 I am your host Alex Jones and we
[08:42.880 --> 08:47.480]  are going to be here for the next three hours John Perkins best-selling
[08:47.480 --> 08:52.480]  author of Economic Hitman or Confessions of an Economic Hitman we'll be joining
[08:52.480 --> 08:57.240]  us to give his his take on the global banking cartels looting of the society
[08:57.240 --> 09:01.800]  and the police states they put in place once they take over to society to
[09:01.800 --> 09:09.560]  continue the bankruptcy and enslavement politically by design just like a spider
[09:09.560 --> 09:13.720]  ties up its prey to take its time sucking it dry that is exactly what's
[09:13.720 --> 09:15.720]  happening we're going to be covering it let me just give you some of the
[09:15.720 --> 09:21.800]  headlines here here's Fox News does army consider Christians Tea Party a terror
[09:21.800 --> 09:28.640]  threat and they put this out on Fox Insider instead of as an official Fox
[09:28.640 --> 09:35.880]  News article the military's gone public from Fort Hood our listeners our listeners
[09:35.880 --> 09:43.440]  I have another unit and said we're being told Christians period are terrorists
[09:43.440 --> 09:49.760]  and that do not give them money or we will be court-martial now see this is
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.160]  economic warfare don't just have the IRS go after the Tea Parties don't just
[09:54.160 --> 09:58.320]  have them go after the pro-life cribs and and don't just have the IRS caught
[09:58.320 --> 10:03.560]  lying to Congress and ordered by Obama to do it and that is that is totally
[10:03.560 --> 10:10.680]  illegal totally oppressive 100% authoritarianism and Fox News won't
[10:10.680 --> 10:14.880]  even talk about it on their official Fox they put it out to folks to the
[10:14.880 --> 10:20.680]  libertarian audience they know is a lucrative wing because they already
[10:20.680 --> 10:23.720]  know the libertarian audience already knows all this so they'll put that out
[10:23.720 --> 10:29.440]  but not actually put it on the news to really change stuff they wanted to
[10:29.440 --> 10:33.920]  destroy Obama they could do it with stuff like this I mean this is not just
[10:33.920 --> 10:36.960]  George Washington's bad the new Army manuals and the founders are bad and
[10:36.960 --> 10:41.760]  guns will be taken and the military's on record now in the manuals being trained
[10:41.760 --> 10:46.480]  to take our guns and have a civil war our military has been captured just like
[10:46.480 --> 10:50.040]  if the Russians had successfully infiltrated over 50 years got all
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.440]  their people in and then announced that gun owners and returning veterans and
[10:54.440 --> 10:58.160]  those that aren't part of the communist dream will be arrested I mean that's
[10:58.160 --> 11:03.680]  basically what this is and you got Navy Seals going public you've got
[11:03.680 --> 11:07.360]  admirals going public you've got colonels going public you've got all these
[11:07.360 --> 11:12.360]  people and it's always on Michael savages show or my show or drugs report
[11:12.360 --> 11:17.520]  dot com or info wars dot com but no one else will report it because if you
[11:17.520 --> 11:21.160]  admitted all then you got to do something about it and then I was
[11:21.160 --> 11:24.840]  psychoanalyzing why I yell and scream and why I get angry because I'm freaked
[11:24.840 --> 11:31.280]  out folks it'd be like if somebody was breaking in my door and I was tied up by
[11:31.280 --> 11:36.080]  the body politic and I needed the politics globally but also domestically
[11:36.080 --> 11:42.240]  the people to wake up collectively to then untie ourselves so we can do
[11:42.240 --> 11:46.240]  something while Freddy Krueger has got his arm through the window of the broken
[11:46.240 --> 11:51.440]  glass on the door turning the doorknob right now and we've historically watched
[11:51.440 --> 11:56.200]  Freddy Krueger butcher everybody on the block historically in the last 100
[11:56.200 --> 11:59.320]  years the very same globalist funding the communist and fascist and
[11:59.320 --> 12:04.720]  authoritarians worldwide from Indonesia to Nazi Germany from Soviet Russia to
[12:04.720 --> 12:11.960]  communist Cuba and and we've watched it and now they're to our door and they're
[12:11.960 --> 12:17.360]  now in our living room and I am tied up until we get the public awake we're all
[12:17.360 --> 12:24.200]  collectively tied up and we're kind of getting our arm out right now of one rope
[12:24.200 --> 12:28.440]  and could start untying ourselves but now Krueger is walking towards us
[12:28.440 --> 12:37.360]  laughing and we got to get out of these ropes fast folks fast I mean we are in
[12:37.360 --> 12:42.760]  mega danger like like a car rolling towards the edge of a cliff we're five
[12:42.760 --> 12:49.320]  feet away and yes we've slowed the car down but Freddy Krueger is behind the
[12:49.320 --> 12:54.200]  car pushing it and telling us don't worry press on the accelerator you know
[12:54.200 --> 12:59.400]  he's waiting for us at the bottom I mean this is a nightmare scenario and I've
[12:59.400 --> 13:07.640]  got literally 200 news articles here each one more insane than the last the US
[13:07.640 --> 13:13.160]  is now known as a dumping ground for all forms of corruption and evil China knows
[13:13.160 --> 13:18.200]  they can't ship poisoned food and medicine to Europe because Europe will
[13:18.200 --> 13:23.000]  sue them or shut down imports they dump it I have more articles today where they
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  know that the regulators will let them dump any amount of poison kidney failure
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.640]  death it doesn't matter the FDA while the FDA is shutting down basically any
[13:34.640 --> 13:39.600]  US business that isn't globalist owned I mean if you're a major chicken
[13:39.600 --> 13:43.080]  producer that's on the globalist operation you can have just rotten food
[13:43.080 --> 13:47.600]  they just radiated spray viruses on it that eat the bacteria look that up if you
[13:47.600 --> 13:50.880]  think I'm kidding they spray live vaccines basically on it I mean it's
[13:50.880 --> 13:58.960]  just a hell house we are a hell house and I just realized that my dad was
[13:58.960 --> 14:01.760]  listening yesterday and he said man you got so dark new listeners might you know
[14:01.760 --> 14:04.920]  think you're being serious you know when you're agreeing with the new world
[14:04.920 --> 14:10.760]  order in that dark satire look whatever people need to hear what the globalist
[14:10.760 --> 14:15.320]  really think about you and they pretty much tell you themselves but I'll go all
[14:15.320 --> 14:19.240]  the way and you know play the part of the globalist here and their mindset
[14:19.240 --> 14:23.320]  towards you but they don't just not care about hurting you and ripping you off
[14:23.320 --> 14:29.320]  they enjoy it and they've now got half the public on welfare and they're soon
[14:29.320 --> 14:35.000]  gonna have 60% and they think it's game over they think it's game over and
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.040]  they're coming folks and I cannot stress to you how much trouble we're in I
[14:40.040 --> 14:47.320]  cannot stress to you I mean the census data two years ago is now out 49% of
[14:47.320 --> 14:54.320]  Americans get government benefits 82 million households on Medicaid they
[14:54.320 --> 14:58.160]  already get their healthcare paid for and now they're going to loot all the
[14:58.160 --> 15:01.800]  working-class people in middle class to just give trillions of dollars to
[15:01.800 --> 15:05.760]  offshore insurance companies who wrote this and then fine and fee all the
[15:05.760 --> 15:09.440]  working poor and drive them into bankruptcy where they've got to go on
[15:09.440 --> 15:13.000]  welfare because then they're going to be told now you got to go show up for
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.360]  compulsory national service to get your welfare now you got to take these shots
[15:16.360 --> 15:20.360]  to get your welfare now your kids are ours this is it this is the you are
[15:20.360 --> 15:25.200]  seeing the real-life collectivization of America and people from the former
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.400]  Eastern Bloc are leaving the US in mass 40 50 60 year old people that grew up
[15:30.400 --> 15:36.040]  under tyranny are crying at Liberty rallies and freaking out and fleeing
[15:36.040 --> 15:39.960]  crying because they thought they could live and die in America and loved
[15:39.960 --> 15:47.200]  America because they've seen it I mean we are we are in red level meltdown
[15:47.200 --> 15:54.320]  okay I mean this is just and I realize that's why I'm in so much mental
[15:54.320 --> 15:59.200]  anguish and why I get so nasty on the air is because it's all true it's all
[15:59.200 --> 16:04.520]  real and Fox News comes out and says soldiers attending pre-deployment
[16:04.520 --> 16:09.240]  briefing at Fort Hood say they were told that evangelical Christians and members
[16:09.240 --> 16:12.440]  of the Tea Party were a threat to the nation and that any soldier donating to
[16:12.440 --> 16:15.960]  those groups would be subjected to punishment under the uniform code of
[16:15.960 --> 16:19.800]  military justice they would be court-martial now folks you have to
[16:19.800 --> 16:24.360]  understand they understand the mainline Tea Party is kind of like Republican
[16:24.360 --> 16:28.800]  libertarian the real Tea Party started by Ron Paul myself and others seven eight
[16:28.800 --> 16:32.680]  years ago is anti-fellow reserve pro-america pro-sovereignty pro bill
[16:32.680 --> 16:37.240]  of rights pro-property rights pro-liberty and we told you in the internal
[16:37.240 --> 16:41.640]  training manuals that federal marshals FBI state police gave us around the
[16:41.640 --> 16:45.040]  country that broke nationally five years ago that they say returning
[16:45.040 --> 16:48.440]  veterans are the number one enemy homeland securities for them next it's
[16:48.440 --> 16:55.240]  gun owners and this is authoritarianism folks when they tell you now from
[16:55.240 --> 17:02.440]  Virginia to Florida from Illinois to Colorado that you can't pack your own
[17:02.440 --> 17:05.960]  child's lunch that's back on the news today you're living in an authoritarian
[17:05.960 --> 17:11.480]  state when they get up on the news and have a creepy woman in a promo that
[17:11.480 --> 17:15.200]  airs every night of the week saying your children belong to us I mean they know
[17:15.200 --> 17:18.800]  what they're doing and you look at them they're craze you look in their eyes
[17:18.800 --> 17:23.120]  these are horrible demons horrible authoritarians they know they're not
[17:23.120 --> 17:27.320]  liberals you understand these are enemy soldiers people this is a military
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.000]  takeover and they're now telling the military just like Hitler did when he
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.200]  finally took over Germany give me your loyalty give me your litmus that you'll
[17:34.200 --> 17:41.080]  arrest kill whoever we say and the German and the Weimar military over 90% of
[17:41.080 --> 17:45.040]  them stayed in the 10% that didn't they purged them later same thing in the
[17:45.040 --> 17:50.560]  Soviet Union Lenin did the same deal and ended up purging folks anyways it's
[17:50.560 --> 17:53.760]  gonna be a lot worse if we don't resist this now I'm gonna I'm here to tell you
[17:53.760 --> 18:00.720]  and so we're in deep trouble I mean do you understand how illegal it is to tell
[18:00.720 --> 18:05.440]  soldiers in memos that have been given to us that the news is covered that are
[18:05.440 --> 18:08.760]  confirmed by the top general of Fort Hood saying you're not allowed to have
[18:08.760 --> 18:14.080]  guns as a soldier outside the base even your own private ones you're not allowed
[18:14.080 --> 18:17.760]  to have those you're not allowed to demonstrate for the First Amendment when
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.080]  you're off duty you know but this is light years worse than that because the
[18:23.080 --> 18:25.920]  headline is does the army consider Christians tea parties a terror threat it
[18:25.920 --> 18:31.360]  goes on you know the headlines should be treason troops taught that Christians
[18:31.360 --> 18:36.360]  are the enemy I mean just wouldn't matter what group it was I told you
[18:36.360 --> 18:39.880]  Homeland Security was always to be flipped onto Christians libertarians
[18:39.880 --> 18:44.400]  returning veterans and all over the country we saw this a few months ago in
[18:44.400 --> 18:48.560]  in in Colorado they called in the state police the the captains of the state
[18:48.560 --> 18:55.640]  police several hundred of them in Colorado the officers and said we're
[18:55.640 --> 19:00.480]  preparing for gun confiscation of radicals including Christians see first
[19:00.480 --> 19:04.800]  they say it's for all kind of then they say it's for gang insurrection and then
[19:04.800 --> 19:09.440]  then they segue to know it's for Christians and by the way they told the
[19:09.440 --> 19:12.120]  state police this came out in the Denver newspapers but they were like oh it's a
[19:12.120 --> 19:15.040]  good thing thank God they're the feds are teaching them this is part of their
[19:15.040 --> 19:18.400]  in-service training that you're gonna have to go house to house and we're gonna
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.600]  take these people in and listen they're going to start a civil war they're
[19:22.600 --> 19:26.560]  they're going to pick groups that you know run savory white supremacist others
[19:26.560 --> 19:30.440]  at first to set the precedent for this and then they're gonna roll out against
[19:30.440 --> 19:36.040]  everybody and this is what they train 24-7 for and when the military reaches
[19:36.040 --> 19:40.560]  out oh let's tell Fox News I've already told Alex about this it just gets spun
[19:40.560 --> 19:44.640]  and stuck in the back of the paper but at least it's there you understand if
[19:44.640 --> 19:49.840]  you don't stand against this they are testing and asking the military not the
[19:49.840 --> 19:52.560]  generals that they've already are on board or they're kicking them out with a
[19:52.560 --> 19:56.600]  litmus test they've moved down to non-commissioned officers which means

[24:15.000 --> 24:18.600]  training manuals we have the troops going public I could open the phones up
[24:18.600 --> 24:23.760]  and have non-commissioned officers officers calling in enlisted folks
[24:23.760 --> 24:27.880]  telling you they're training to take the guns I mean it's in the news I see it
[24:27.880 --> 24:32.160]  in local news stories in Texas but also all over the country all the time where
[24:32.160 --> 24:36.160]  they'll have locals at the school with the National Guard and the regular army
[24:36.160 --> 24:42.640]  of the Marines are all three or local Air Force MPs you name it and they're
[24:42.640 --> 24:46.560]  training to go take people's guns I mean it's in the news all the time
[24:46.560 --> 24:51.080]  Arcadia, Iowa, remember four years ago they practice going door-to-door to take
[24:51.080 --> 24:54.840]  the guns and it was in the news that well they're trained to take guns during
[24:54.840 --> 24:58.880]  an emergency in America first place the army hit with the Colonel was the local
[24:58.880 --> 25:02.440]  gun shop that helped play along then they practice going door-to-door to find
[25:02.440 --> 25:07.060]  the hidden guns in America and then they freak out and go conspiracy terrorist
[25:07.060 --> 25:10.400]  Jones thinks it's for America when I had the quotes from the article the day
[25:10.400 --> 25:15.200]  before and the paper backtracked and said we were insane and none of it was real
[25:15.200 --> 25:19.520]  see because then there was a backlash it was a Psyop test in a town of 700
[25:19.520 --> 25:23.880]  Arcadia to see if they could announce gun confiscation in the paper to see if
[25:23.880 --> 25:28.280]  in a small group and of course later I learned from Army sources that indeed
[25:28.280 --> 25:33.040]  their Psyops was there Psyops by the way didn't like what was going on but they're
[25:33.040 --> 25:38.720]  all so scared they went along with the mission you better be scared of
[25:38.720 --> 25:43.960]  following this mission a mission to destroy your country I mean this isn't
[25:43.960 --> 25:47.560]  like losing some war and some questionable operation for the globalist
[25:47.560 --> 25:54.360]  this is a this is losing America and you're just gonna follow orders and do
[25:54.360 --> 26:00.840]  it huh I've got all this other news I'm gonna get to but I'd I'd like to hear
[26:00.840 --> 26:05.040]  from the military I'd like to hear from police actually because the military
[26:05.040 --> 26:07.400]  will call in and say they're not gonna be part of it and they're being trained to
[26:07.400 --> 26:13.120]  do it they don't like it but I'd like to hear from the four hood troops who I
[26:13.120 --> 26:19.880]  know listen every day I'd like to hear from folks all over the country but
[26:19.880 --> 26:26.240]  police as well active duty and active police do I get an apology now I don't
[26:26.240 --> 26:29.880]  want the apology I don't even care I just want you to listen I want to save
[26:29.880 --> 26:39.080]  the country they're teaching them that the Tea Party and evangelical Christians
[26:39.080 --> 26:42.120]  who believe in the second coming of Christ that's Janet Reno on 60 minutes
[26:42.120 --> 26:47.040]  two thousand 1995 she said if you believe in the second coming of Christ you
[26:47.040 --> 26:52.440]  are in a cult and you are a terrorist that's on record if we could dig the
[26:52.440 --> 26:57.760]  clip-up and you're like well why are they coming after us I'm just gonna try to
[26:57.760 --> 27:01.960]  homeschool live out in the woods they're gonna come get your kids they're gonna
[27:01.960 --> 27:06.760]  teach them Jocelyn elders said don't you get it these are perverts they want
[27:06.760 --> 27:10.840]  control and the number one thing they want your kids just like in Sodom and
[27:10.840 --> 27:14.440]  Gomorrah they wanted your kids and just like in Nazi Germany the state wanted the
[27:14.440 --> 27:19.480]  kids and just like in Soviet Russia and Malz Cuba and every other country the
[27:19.480 --> 27:25.880]  statist want the kids don't you get it they're coming for your kids and they
[27:25.880 --> 27:29.600]  know you're gonna try to work three jobs and live out in the countryside and
[27:29.600 --> 27:33.120]  try to have communities and the Rural Affairs Commission under Department of
[27:33.120 --> 27:38.120]  Defense has now got Pentagon psyops in every small town literally doing
[27:38.120 --> 27:42.640]  assessments on how to shut things down and they're gonna do it I mean the
[27:42.640 --> 27:48.960]  magnitude of this military attack we are under total military attack and now
[27:48.960 --> 27:53.280]  they've gone all the way down to the enlisted that's the reason you're
[27:53.280 --> 27:56.400]  hearing about this it was in the documents years ago but all that's just a
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.200]  document oh Alex says there's a civilian inmate labor camp program nobody
[28:00.200 --> 28:05.760]  go look up it was public Alex says there's rec 84 and garden splicer and or
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.840]  cable splicer and garden plot and Alex says there's this of the National
[28:10.840 --> 28:14.680]  Emergency Centers Establishment Act and Alex says and Alex says I didn't say
[28:14.680 --> 28:20.640]  any of it was all public and I have my sources we know they're exact plans we
[28:20.640 --> 28:23.240]  don't know how they'll try to implement them in what order but I mean it is
[28:23.240 --> 28:27.440]  hellish they're not just going to conquer us like they've done France with
[28:27.440 --> 28:31.440]  hundred percent taxes on the middle class 100% they're getting rid of them
[28:31.440 --> 28:34.640]  the elite are all tax exempt that's what's back accounts on record including
[28:34.640 --> 28:38.000]  the socialist leaders because they're not socialist leaders they're mafia
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.760]  criminals authoritarianism has scientifically come to America they
[28:43.760 --> 28:48.920]  are gutting everything by design and I want to hear from military I want to
[28:48.920 --> 28:53.000]  hear from police I can't believe police have to think about it too on the
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.440]  street and go I don't want to take the guns but if I'm ordered to I'm not
[28:57.440 --> 29:01.640]  gonna say I'm not gonna say all because all you care about your status and that
[29:01.640 --> 29:05.240]  uniform that now represents the New World Order unless you stand and mad at
[29:05.240 --> 29:11.320]  uniform represent liberty and justice this is a big deal here that now it's
[29:11.320 --> 29:17.720]  down to the grassroots military it's down to the enlisted privates they're
[29:17.720 --> 29:20.960]  being taught George Washington's bad Christians are bad I mean they actually
[29:20.960 --> 29:24.000]  get them in there and if you hang up on the bulletin board the oath they pull it
[29:24.000 --> 29:31.640]  down the officer walks in and tears it off the wall I have FEMA on video saying
[29:31.640 --> 29:35.800]  the Constitution is terrorism and the founding fathers are bad it's in my
[29:35.800 --> 29:42.280]  film road to tyranny free online and that was in 2001 okay these people are

[33:52.880 --> 33:58.680]  inbred psychopathic eugenicists and they are the enemy of everything free
[33:58.680 --> 34:02.960]  decent and good bottom line
[34:05.960 --> 34:16.040]  Fort Hood has now gone public and also responded in an unclassified release to
[34:16.040 --> 34:27.520]  their statements dealing with with the veterans and how they're openly training
[34:27.520 --> 34:31.160]  to take on the American people let me go back to this article that I was just
[34:31.160 --> 34:42.840]  that I was just mentioning okay continuing here with the news does Army
[34:42.840 --> 34:46.840]  consider Christians Tea Party a terror threat and then it begs the question
[34:46.840 --> 34:50.240]  because it goes on to say soldiers attending a pre-deployment briefing at
[34:50.240 --> 34:54.000]  Fort Hood where they were doing riot control and gun confiscation drills I
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.240]  should add that was in their local paper so they were told that evangelical
[34:57.240 --> 35:00.120]  Christians and members of the Tea Party were a threat to the nation and that any
[35:00.120 --> 35:03.480]  soldier donating to those groups this is violating their first amendment this is
[35:03.480 --> 35:07.640]  a trillion times worse than what Nixon did with a few hundred names of people
[35:07.640 --> 35:15.400]  off the IRS they give all your info now to the TSA folks everything's public to
[35:15.400 --> 35:19.080]  these criminals soldiers attending a pre-deployment briefing at Fort Hood say
[35:19.080 --> 35:22.880]  they were told that evangelical Christians and members of the Tea Party
[35:22.880 --> 35:27.760]  were a threat to the nation and that any soldier donating those groups would be
[35:27.760 --> 35:33.880]  subjected to punishment under the uniform code of military justice the
[35:33.880 --> 35:39.360]  October 17th briefing a soldier attended told the reporter that those
[35:39.360 --> 35:42.800]  attending the briefing they told me that the counterintelligence agent in
[35:42.800 --> 35:46.880]  charge of the meetings he counterintelligence dealing with the
[35:46.880 --> 35:50.920]  enemy the American people because it's a foreign officer spent nearly a half
[35:50.920 --> 35:54.320]  hour discussing how even evangelical Christians and groups like the
[35:54.320 --> 35:59.160]  American Family Association just see they really hate mainline groups like that
[35:59.160 --> 36:04.160]  and and and and dobson and they're really threatened by just really nice
[36:04.160 --> 36:09.680]  friendly mainline Christian groups that have you know little audio books for
[36:09.680 --> 36:17.080]  kids and things I mean oh man I just it's so unbelievably evil I mean this is
[36:17.080 --> 36:21.240]  the Soviet takeover of America but it's bankers using that technology of
[36:21.240 --> 36:25.600]  control Michael Barry an attorney of the Liberty Institute is advising the
[36:25.600 --> 36:30.000]  soldier and has launched an investigation to the incident the America
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.400]  public should be outraged the US Army is teaching our troops the evangelical
[36:33.400 --> 36:36.880]  Christians and Tea Party members are enemies of America and that they can be
[36:36.880 --> 36:40.440]  punished for supporting or participating in those groups said Barry a former
[36:40.440 --> 36:43.720]  Marine Corps Jag officer these statements about evangelicals being
[36:43.720 --> 36:48.800]  domestic enemies are a serious charge it's not a charge I love how the media
[36:48.800 --> 36:52.600]  always acts like they don't know and then even the lawyer involved thinks it's
[36:52.600 --> 36:57.600]  just Fort Hood and just thinks it's it's everywhere on record we have the
[36:57.600 --> 37:02.600]  training manuals they're all on info wars calm it's all been covered by the
[37:02.600 --> 37:08.080]  news after we break it saying returning veterans of the number one enemy gun
[37:08.080 --> 37:13.680]  owners are number two Christians are number three period libertarians
[37:13.680 --> 37:22.240]  mainline Republicans do you understand this they are gonna get more than 50
[37:22.240 --> 37:26.480]  percent of the public on welfare there are 49% and they're going to have them
[37:26.480 --> 37:30.640]  vote to take everything and the bankers are all exempt so they don't care so I
[37:30.640 --> 37:37.120]  want to hear from police and I want to hear from military about this you have a
[37:37.120 --> 37:41.480]  war on the press a war on whistleblowers you have incredible corruption
[37:41.480 --> 37:46.480]  going on you have all these corrupt interests alluding the country seven
[37:46.480 --> 37:51.680]  ways to Sunday and the military number one threat not the communist Chinese not
[37:51.680 --> 37:56.800]  the Russians not al-Qaeda the number one job mission is now homeland command
[37:56.800 --> 38:04.040]  north com brigades in every sector training 24-7 to kill people wearing
[38:04.040 --> 38:08.240]  overalls and John Deere hats I've shown you the video I've been to the urban
[38:08.240 --> 38:11.840]  warfare drills the troops have called in and broke down crying and said I heard
[38:11.840 --> 38:15.600]  you talk about this I didn't believe it we practice and they always start crying
[38:15.600 --> 38:19.960]  because it's not that they're scared or wimps it's painful when they go out and
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.040]  train to kill somebody that looks like their granddaddy did they're training
[38:24.040 --> 38:27.960]  to kill the rural people because they know they're the only ones when they
[38:27.960 --> 38:31.480]  take over that are going to be able to hold out and grow their own food they're
[38:31.480 --> 38:35.640]  going to kill everybody they are good you understand they're going to bring in
[38:35.640 --> 38:40.240]  foreign troops everything I'm sure of it now that's why they built the invasion
[38:40.240 --> 38:44.240]  routes out of Mexico down to the major ports with the Napa Superhighway has put
[38:44.240 --> 38:49.360]  the country in two with a chai-com operation it's all real folks everything

[39:14.640 --> 39:18.200]  and they'll have it on national television with racial Maddow hosting it

[40:49.940 --> 40:55.700]  like the King James much stronger but a time to weep a time to laugh a time to
[40:55.700 --> 41:00.200]  mourn a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather
[41:00.200 --> 41:04.600]  stones together see there's time to let them hurt you there's time to stand
[41:04.600 --> 41:09.160]  up let's go back to it a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones

[41:13.960 --> 41:18.840]  and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to rend and a
[41:18.840 --> 41:23.720]  time to so a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time
[41:23.720 --> 41:30.240]  to hate a time of war and a time of peace what prophet hath he that worketh
[41:30.240 --> 41:37.680]  that weareth in he laboreth I hath seen the travail which God hath given to the
[41:37.680 --> 41:43.040]  sons of men to be exercised in it he hath made everything beautiful in his
[41:43.040 --> 41:49.640]  time also have set the world in their heart so that no man can find out of
[41:49.640 --> 41:56.160]  the work God maketh from the beginning to the end I know that there is no good
[41:56.160 --> 42:02.760]  in them but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life and also that every
[42:02.760 --> 42:08.200]  man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of his labor it is the gift of God
[42:08.200 --> 42:13.560]  no you didn't build that God didn't build that it's the gift of the state see
[42:13.560 --> 42:18.560]  and and and we sit here print me the King James version please so that I don't
[42:18.560 --> 42:24.440]  want to read that later thank you the issue here ladies and gentlemen is is
[42:24.440 --> 42:28.800]  that we're at the crossroads and everybody knows it and they wouldn't be
[42:28.800 --> 42:33.080]  given the orders down to the enlisted to get ready to take guns and arrest the
[42:33.080 --> 42:36.800]  Christians and kill those that resist and take their guns I mean these people
[42:36.800 --> 42:41.120]  are just abominations and the false flag is also going to be economic collapse
[42:41.120 --> 42:46.000]  where they pose as the saviors and God help us and God help all the fools in
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.200]  Congress that went along with this when they roll this in there's gonna be a
[42:49.200 --> 42:53.200]  lot of scores settled they're gonna guaranteed a whole bunch of Congress
[42:53.200 --> 42:56.840]  people are end up getting their throat slit by the establishment if this is
[42:56.840 --> 43:03.160]  going to be this is going to make the red takeover in 1917 1918 and the 10 years
[43:03.160 --> 43:08.600]  it took him to consolidate power over Russia look like a cakewalk and I'm
[43:08.600 --> 43:13.200]  here to tell you bowing down to this is what's gonna allow the rivers of blood
[43:13.200 --> 43:17.800]  to flow we could stop this right now but we let them tell us that hey you can't
[43:17.800 --> 43:20.440]  pack your kids school lunch your kids belong to us we're gonna give you
[43:20.440 --> 43:24.240]  vaccines even though there's no law we're gonna have checkpoints even though
[43:24.240 --> 43:27.240]  it's illegal we're gonna leave the borders open we're gonna give the
[43:27.240 --> 43:30.880]  illegals all this free welfare to incentivize them coming here but cut
[43:30.880 --> 43:38.400]  your welfare it is so hellish what they've done I mean look at some let me
[43:38.400 --> 43:42.560]  give you the toll-free number for military and police to call in 800 259
[43:42.560 --> 43:51.600]  92 31 800 259 92 31 you are not going to grovel to this and get out of it it is
[43:51.600 --> 43:58.440]  exterminism it is death I'd use the fifth element analogy of the dark entity
[43:58.440 --> 44:02.400]  coming towards the earth to destroy everything you don't make a deal with
[44:02.400 --> 44:07.320]  that it comes to kill everything that's of course an allegory of Satan you need
[44:07.320 --> 44:11.200]  to understand that ladies and gentlemen you cannot make a deal with this you
[44:11.200 --> 44:16.720]  cannot reason with it it's all a lie you've got to realize this is the great
[44:16.720 --> 44:21.960]  coming of evil and and and we can get a reprieve but it's going to take everybody
[44:21.960 --> 44:27.120]  admitting how much trouble we're really in they're now publicly going well maybe
[44:27.120 --> 44:30.360]  Christians are terrorist and they're teaching the state police at everywhere
[44:30.360 --> 44:33.520]  and they're teaching the military and they're teaching them that they're
[44:33.520 --> 44:37.120]  gonna take our guns that's why police chiefs on tape now won't say they won't
[44:37.120 --> 44:42.640]  take the guns when I was out there at that gun rally they had feds standing
[44:42.640 --> 44:47.120]  behind and giving orders to the police chief of San Antonio because they're
[44:47.120 --> 44:52.000]  not feds they are globalist and they've been put in positions because they will
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.840]  carry out the orders and they've been promised great power all you're going
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.320]  to get is the same thing that others that serve evil get you will be destroyed
[45:01.320 --> 45:05.800]  but most importantly you are honorless you are pathetic I want to hear from
[45:05.800 --> 45:10.720]  military I want to hear from police currently are you too scared to even
[45:10.720 --> 45:18.720]  call in and say you will stand for liberty 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 and
[45:18.720 --> 45:22.360]  they're bringing in the tyranny because they have to they want to break this
[45:22.360 --> 45:26.800]  country's back for once and for all it makes cloud and piven look like a
[45:26.800 --> 45:31.080]  blessing what they want to do here it's more like breaking the back of Poland or
[45:31.080 --> 45:35.800]  Ukraine under Soviet occupation in fact it's pretty much the same battle plan
[45:35.800 --> 45:39.760]  except we're heavily armed and we've known they were coming we've been digging
[45:39.760 --> 45:44.160]  in that's why they announce us as the enemy that the people that have occupied
[45:44.160 --> 45:48.120]  the country the globalist and their corporate interest using Soviet model
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.640]  control again they're not Soviets they're using Soviet model control the
[45:52.640 --> 45:56.400]  Soviets worked for them before the same big banks they were able to bring them
[45:56.400 --> 46:02.760]  down America was too strong now they've basically got us they think 800-259-9231
[46:02.760 --> 46:08.040]  and then I've got this on info wars.com feds order school to ban packed lunches
[46:08.040 --> 46:13.720]  without doctor's note this is in the local news dear parents I have received

[48:47.880 --> 48:53.400]  even know where to start it just doesn't make any sense like when I woke up about
[48:53.400 --> 48:58.200]  six months ago it was my six year anniversary for being in the military in
[48:58.200 --> 49:01.800]  this whole time before then I didn't even understand what was leading up to it
[49:01.800 --> 49:07.840]  and like now I think back and I there's little pieces that start fitting
[49:07.840 --> 49:16.120]  together like I'm in the desert doing desert training in California and I'm
[49:16.120 --> 49:23.440]  going to the defect with people from Turkey and other countries and man it's

[49:32.280 --> 49:37.320]  first time like I think it was endgame and I've seen it my jaw dropped and I
[49:37.320 --> 49:41.680]  believed every single bit of it because I'm an intelligent individual and I can
[49:41.680 --> 49:46.280]  see what's happening and what's going on and I've tried to wake up so many people
[49:46.280 --> 49:51.760]  I every piece every person I've seen my Facebook got shut off and people started
[49:51.760 --> 49:57.040]  calling me higher up than me in the military and we're telling me that I
[49:57.040 --> 50:01.600]  need to stop saying what I'm saying right like my I'm gonna ask you this what
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.360]  do you make of the Fox News thing we already knew about this it's part of

[50:21.120 --> 50:26.200]  it's incredible first time I heard about anything religious wise I was told
[50:26.200 --> 50:34.000]  that we are not allowed to witness to people anymore to try to turn them to

[54:10.560 --> 54:13.760]  got a more detailed article than Fox News out for the soldiers told it
[54:13.760 --> 54:19.280]  Christians tea partyers and radical are a radical terror threat but the issue
[54:19.280 --> 54:22.160]  there isn't even that that's been going on for a long time and it's total
[54:22.160 --> 54:28.840]  treason and totally illegal and domestic authoritarian takeover the issue is is
[54:28.840 --> 54:34.000]  that they're saying don't give money like don't give money to al Qaeda or will
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.240]  arrest you under NDA a they're saying we will arrest you if you give to
[54:38.240 --> 54:44.080]  evangelical groups evangelical groups are probably in the top two may be the
[54:44.080 --> 54:49.920]  biggest group in this country after Catholics I mean that's like saying 60
[54:49.920 --> 54:53.080]  70 million people that identify themselves with evangelicals type
[54:53.080 --> 54:58.440]  stuff you don't give them money that's how you politically crush people as you
[54:58.440 --> 55:03.640]  say don't be part of this a credit swiss is coming out and launching gay
[55:03.640 --> 55:08.440]  friendly company index saying they'll do business with people that socially
[55:08.440 --> 55:12.480]  promote the gay lifestyle and again it's not like oh here's my bank they
[55:12.480 --> 55:16.600]  everything is going to be leveraged money wise to make you comply
[55:16.600 --> 55:21.720]  authoritarianism this is the takeover folks they've already got our kids we
[55:21.720 --> 55:25.600]  put up with anything we let them tell us that we can't bring sack lunches for
[55:25.600 --> 55:30.680]  our kids that paper bags are racist why not we do whatever they say of course
[55:30.680 --> 55:35.080]  they're telling briefly I'm gonna go to your calls Charles in Arkansas real
[55:35.080 --> 55:40.120]  fast this did come out in the news last year where they said even off-duty you
[55:40.120 --> 55:45.680]  don't tell people about Jesus go ahead yes that's true that's true I gotta tell
[55:45.680 --> 55:51.840]  you what started my awakening though okay nine months before my sixth year
[55:51.840 --> 55:58.960]  anniversary in the military I went on a mission and it was to deliver vehicles
[55:58.960 --> 56:04.880]  to all the armories around Arkansas the amount of armored vehicles that we were
[56:04.880 --> 56:12.000]  bringing like it kind of you can't just see that and not think about there's
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.160]  something wrong here and then we start getting turret kits and I've been in for
[56:16.160 --> 56:21.200]  six years and I have never seen heavy machine guns that many and then now I
[56:21.200 --> 56:25.760]  work on night vision goggles we have night vision goggles for every single
[56:25.760 --> 56:31.600]  person in our unit that's where we're a maintenance unit yeah for those that
[56:31.600 --> 56:34.760]  don't know and this is what I was told by family along this is like eight years
[56:34.760 --> 56:40.160]  ago they were in Austin at the air base shifting to where even the maintenance
[56:40.160 --> 56:44.960]  people are training for not riot control seek and destroy operations against the
[56:44.960 --> 56:48.840]  American people and that's it a domestic army with better equipment than
[56:48.840 --> 56:54.240]  frontline soldiers have gotten Iraq for us and Iraq was a laboratory the
[56:54.240 --> 56:58.480]  Pentagon admitted in one document I saw for America this is all checkpoint
[56:58.480 --> 57:03.680]  insurgency Fallujah style stuff so yes okay so so basically you're seeing it
[57:03.680 --> 57:09.040]  all built up with these arms caches and those are in the news as well and then
[57:09.040 --> 57:15.280]  I I was just telling family members like how weird it was so I just went and
[57:15.280 --> 57:19.240]  searched conspiracies and I started seeing your name pop up everywhere so I
[57:19.240 --> 57:23.640]  was like man I gotta check this guy out you know YouTube it and end games the
[57:23.640 --> 57:27.720]  first thing that pops up and like I said it just dropped my jaw that's all I got
[57:27.720 --> 57:32.680]  to say well God bless you sir and just how many people in your units that you
[57:32.680 --> 57:36.800]  work with how many of now understand what's happening oh my god the first
[57:36.800 --> 57:41.560]  time I ever heard it like anyone talk about badly about the government was
[57:41.560 --> 57:47.080]  last to drill okay and even larger sergeants and every single person is
[57:47.080 --> 57:52.240]  talking about it and it's the chatter it's 80% of my unit let's be clear let's
[57:52.240 --> 57:56.440]  be clear though this is not the government just like of a hijacker hijacks an
[57:56.440 --> 58:00.160]  airplane and psychologically they do this puts on the captain's uniform because
[58:00.160 --> 58:03.640]  people submit them okay I mean it's like if you came home when you're ten years
[58:03.640 --> 58:09.000]  old and a guy's wearing your dad's work uniform and says hi son I'm your dad and
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.440]  your mom's hanging there and you're you know and all this stuff you're like
[58:12.440 --> 58:16.400]  you're not my dad they're like yes I am your papa this is not the government
[58:16.400 --> 58:20.520]  when you done this is an infiltration well God bless you that's the best news
[58:20.520 --> 58:23.880]  I've heard but let me tell you they could really put on some theatrics you know
[58:23.880 --> 58:28.640]  a militia attacking a school detonating a nuke with al-qaeda you're like that
[58:28.640 --> 58:31.880]  didn't make sense the militias don't like al-qaeda the scripts are saying that
[58:31.880 --> 58:36.600]  that's what they're prescripting I'm telling you I mean folks we're in a
[58:36.600 --> 58:41.040]  Mexican standoff with the New World Order basically

[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.200]  what is a Mexican standoff it's where one person's pointing a gun at somebody
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.080]  other person's pointing a gun at them then somebody else's pointing a gun at
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:34.840]  that person what is being shanghai it's being knocked on the head on the west
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:39.740]  coast and thrown on the ship and taken to be press ganged in the Orient but the
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.760]  political correct people don't want you knowing language so they just say
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.720]  that's racist here's one telegraph offensive Halloween costumes banned by

[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.840]  rednecks are racist working in the countryside and being white and working
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.400]  as racist and now University of Colorado Boulder tells students to avoid
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.520]  costumes including cowboys Indians white trash or anything politically deemed
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:13.040]  offensive that's right mind control and brown paper bags are racist no they're
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.840]  not it's about making you shut down and be scared to talk and learn and
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.760]  interface it's authoritarianism or if you just joined us info wars commas
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:27.080]  reporting but so is Fox News they are telling army soldiers that if you give
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.520]  money to Christian groups you will be court marshals and arrested because
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.720]  evangelicals that believe in a second coming a Christ our terrorist you cannot
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.800]  make this up we're taking military and police calls who's been holding the
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.000]  longest now that be Scott then I'm gonna go to Jim and Daniel and last is a
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.560]  police officer and we're gonna hold our guests it's coming up John Perkins till
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:50.160]  20 after we're gonna go to him after we go to your calls Scott in North Carolina
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:56.760]  says you're in the army what is your take on saying that Christians and Tea
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:03.800]  Party period our terrorist well that's flat out ridiculous obviously just to
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:10.160]  know I'm out of the military a few years separated but when I was in I didn't
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:16.840]  pick up on any of that sentiment we had briefings regarding domestic type
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:23.320]  terrorist threat or a political extremist type of organizations I've
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:32.920]  personally don't recall much of that but you know it's just a total overstep and
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:38.680]  attack and pretty much a brainwashing attempt no that's it that's it Scott it's
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.760]  total authoritarianism thank you for calling in God bless you I want to
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.080]  talk to folks who specifically are in right now or police who are getting
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.000]  these briefings or have gotten to similar things when we know about the
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.960]  briefings we have links this is confirmed but I want to hear what you
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:56.360]  think about this maybe like if aliens landed and said we are your leaders
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.480]  anyone that doesn't want to be under you know our control as a traitor I mean
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.120]  it's it's that ridiculous less in Oklahoma who's a police officer what is
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:11.280]  your take on this less well hey buddy
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:19.400]  well what I don't want to make is that a back sometimes back police departments
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:28.960]  were able to get m16 auto Colt a1 m16s from the government for $78 a piece and
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:39.080]  that was delivered for $78 now the full auto m16 to me that is something that
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.000]  you really don't need unless you're going to be going against somebody else
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.920]  with war weapons but I think this to me is just part of them gearing up to put
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:57.600]  munitions in place for when something does happen that's right no it's on
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.360]  record under we're great homeland they are putting in every sector in their
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.480]  different sizes depending on the geographic area and population it's on
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.160]  record sir see everything you've already reverse engineered is in documents as
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:14.120]  well you can go look them up they are cashing the armored vehicles the weapons
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.160]  everything so they can come get them when they need them and take them from
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.360]  you and then have special federalized special event units that are going to be
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:27.640]  expanded that are really federal auxiliary as you know yes sir yes sir I
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:32.920]  know that and but you know for $78 for full auto m16 I'm not talking three
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:36.840]  round burst I'm talking full auto m16 say what let's stay there don't hang up
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.320]  I'm gonna come right back come right back to you it's a short segment I'm gonna
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:45.280]  come back to you then we're gonna talk to Michael Jim and Daniel and then we're
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.320]  gonna get our guests on about what the banks are doing to us look they're
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.460]  openly saying the veterans of the number one terror threat gun owners and then
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:57.160]  Christians and telling troops you'll be arrested in court Marshall if you give

[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:44.560]  more importantly they've been told by the counterterrorism counter insurgency
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.920]  federal officers that now command them under Homeland Security oh that's now
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:56.680]  official the new fifth column literally quite literally officially Pentagon run
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:01.720]  now via Homeland Security so they've merged the two putting a former Pentagon
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:08.360]  official over it yeah Johnson his name is actually Ja Johnson but you have all
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.680]  of this going on and they tell him you will be court-martialed if you give
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.720]  money to any evangelical group or if you give money to any tea party group
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.000]  which are legal lawful groups being harassed and persecuted by the IRS
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.600]  that's why some of the top evangelicals and the Southern Baptist as well came
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.720]  out and said turn your guns in this year because they've been told by the IRS
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:35.200]  it's come out in Congress that they tell them stop protesting abortion clinics
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.080]  and you we won't seize your bank accounts or arrest you and they go but
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.480]  we're not doing wrong we're a 501c3 we're a charity a Christian charity

[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.080]  go good victory they want to shut down our political activities this is so
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.440]  illegal this is so evil this is what we were brought up to learn about Russia and
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:04.440]  China and Cuba and they're doing it and we got a police officer less in
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.520]  Oklahoma talking about how they're giving him m16s and weapons basically for
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.400]  nothing armored vehicles are being pre-deployed everywhere then we're gonna
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:18.320]  go to Michael and Jim and Daniel and then we've got John Perkins Confessions of
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.440]  an Economic Hitman joining us let's finish up any other points you want to
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.040]  make and I'm sure you guys get your federal in-service training to get the
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.560]  free federal money that's not really free I mean it's in all those manuals
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:34.080]  that anybody that talks about a second coming a crisis a radical Ron Paul's a
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.920]  radical a lot of them say Alex Jones is evil and a radical we get those reports
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.840]  anybody that doesn't like the Federal Reserve is evil returning veterans of
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.840]  the number one enemy I mean have you been taught that in your department no
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.880]  we haven't been taught that here in our department and and I will say yet anyway
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:58.800]  and as far as people being radical or you being radical or whoever anybody
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.040]  anybody who's aware of the truth is what's going on they're going to call
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:08.080]  radical I know that for myself if I am ordered to take guns for Christians to
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:13.600]  take guns from anybody I am one officer and I know of many many other
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:20.280]  officers who will throw their badge and commission cards on the desk and go home
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.800]  well that's a good thing to do the problem is then down the road as they
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.360]  shut the economy down you get put on a list so what do we do when the next
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:34.240]  phase comes and they come to throw you in a gulag with a bunch of communists
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.600]  that's who they're going to use as their enforcers literally torturing us to
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.120]  death I mean that's I'm not kidding that's what they do everywhere else
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:43.840]  that's what the weathermen that raised Obama planned we have all the training
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.680]  you know films all their plans that came out I'm not kidding if they could get
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:54.280]  away with it that's their goal so so what do we do at that point well at that
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.760]  point I know myself that I am not gonna go to a gulag I'm not gonna go anywhere
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:05.440]  I'm a free American and I'm just not gonna go I will not lay down and say
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:12.040]  okay I'm going no that will not happen and I know many many other officers that
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:17.560]  they will not lay down and go well God bless you sir and I appreciate your
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.000]  call and that's an honorable thing to say so many police now won't even say
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.240]  that on record and here's how it'll work though they'll say oh sergeant whatever
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.840]  his you know name is sergeant Jones or sergeant Brown or sergeant Bukowski or
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:38.120]  sergeant Gonzalez whatever the name is he had child porn you know he had illegal
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:44.040]  guns he was selling him he killed his wife something like that you'll know
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.200]  when you see it happen to a bunch of people it's pure bull I mean just just
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.880]  know that up front like all these generals they've been kicking out we now
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.360]  have Navy SEAL sources public and also off record that have confirmed the Navy
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:02.400]  Admiral was given the litmus test for gun confiscation and other issues and was
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.120]  removed and that we have another source saying that yes the word is on the other
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:10.920]  general that something to do with the missing nukes and a litmus test that he
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.320]  was criticizing the chain of command above him and saying this is unconstitutional
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:19.720]  and now you don't hear from those generals and admirals I mean they are
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.960]  just culling the military out right now because I mean I'm not even saying these
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:27.280]  generals are like angels or anything the point is though it takes a lot to really
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.960]  gut a country and to really shine on to evil I mean when you sign on to the new
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.800]  world order I want to be clear if we had boss hogs taking over who were just
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.840]  losing some stuff and being corrupt I would criticize them I would fight them
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:46.200]  but I wouldn't be up on air freaking out I mean they don't like us they want to
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:51.080]  extinguish us a tyrants have always hated Americans because we've been free
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:55.000]  and rebellious and armed they've got to have a world government with disarmed
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.360]  slaves they got to take us down they're not secure till they've done it and
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.080]  they're using the communist Chinese and their billion 300 million poor souls
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.680]  that are their slaves to leverage everybody out and as the muscle and I've
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.240]  been told by high-level sources over and over again there's a plan to bring in
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:19.240]  communist Chinese troops up from Mexico on the Baja side on that big giant port
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.520]  they've got the biggest in the world they're building and to bring them up
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:28.040]  and call them stability troops as an I for mission of the UN now that's being
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:32.580]  discussed and now the Chinese government can run what movies we have in
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:36.400]  control and I used to hear that thank you guys this is some bait and switch where
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:39.320]  we got to worry about some outside enemy and now I realize I've looked at it all
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.680]  ago my gosh they they really are planning that and that's what the
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.000]  weathermen raising Obama it came out in federal documents they admitted it
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.400]  graph wall heard them and they admitted in court that they were gonna bring the
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:15:01.920]  communist Chinese and to middle America they've had this plan forever I just can't
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:07.040]  believe it I just it's so crazy and with a straight face they go you can't pack
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.160]  your kids lunches you can't see your kids at school we're putting bar bar
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.000]  fences up your kids belong to us we're gonna give them shots whether you all
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.240]  over the country they give shots a knock they give the kids shots without
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.720]  asking the parents well let's go to cut the calls I'm just marveling I'm sorry
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:27.320]  Michael in Kentucky you're in the army what's your take on all this and you've
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.960]  known anybody that's been given this training that Christians are the new
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:36.520]  enemy former army and the reason why I'm not there anymore is because they did
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:42.880]  ask me that question and I that's what I think about all of it is that they you
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.760]  know it is a not commissioned officer which we are the backbone of the
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:56.040]  military I don't urge all NCOs listening to your program to remember what your
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:02.440]  oath is and I have an oathkeeper also and you keep that squared away high and
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:11.600]  tight and when this thing kicks off we're gonna win you know what I'm
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.680]  saddest about not only we lose a lot of good patriots in this the average cop
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.040]  and military person we're gonna be fighting doesn't even know what they're
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.160]  part of I really don't want to have to kill these people to defend my family
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:28.480]  but I'll do whatever I have to it once it starts but it's it's it's nobody
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:38.040]  wants to do that okay but the initiation of the action is what once it's on it's
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:44.680]  on okay and you know the you take those snot nose kids that are police officers
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:50.800]  now and sheriffs who haven't got a clue that they're you know they're supposed
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:55.560]  to be there for the people well when this kicks off they're not going to be
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:02.240]  able to stand with staying the onslaught from the citizenry ex-military people
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:07.320]  that are mad there's weapons everywhere they you know that they're gonna try it
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:13.080]  but and it's gonna get ugly and you don't want to have to do that but well
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:16.600]  look I want to say this I'm not even in a defensive gonna be offensive they
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.840]  start it because I'm obviously a political type leader but my issue is I
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.880]  know they're gonna come after me I'm not gonna just lay down to these people and
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:28.080]  and that's not bad I mean that that's my right to stand up against the
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:34.440]  initiation of force yeah you're you you're exactly right but you know the
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:40.280]  best defense is on the offense I know and you're you're on the offense with
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.040]  the program everything that you guys are doing on the website you're waking
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.400]  people up right and left you know every day I'm out here on the pipeline right
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:55.480]  now okay and there's probably a crew of 90 out here and there's an inspector I'm
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:02.080]  walking around talking to him and you know 85% of these guys are awake I'm
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:08.680]  seeing info wars out here inside of two trailers okay the best defense is an
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:15.200]  offense and and I would I would urge the the public that has never been in the
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:22.520]  military okay I wouldn't get on the offense let's let's let's form a military
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:28.400]  and reservists and anybody that's got a got the right mind let them get on the
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.040]  offense then that's another question yeah who do you get on the offense
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:38.240]  against obviously it's the globalist operatives the politicos that are going
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.320]  to be trying to command the military and police into the fight those are the
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:47.000]  people that think they're going to sit back in terry town or wherever and call
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.800]  the shots it isn't going to work that way well at the tip of the spear okay in
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:57.360]  the tip of the spear is that idiot from any town USA that's willing to do their
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:05.960]  bidding that's that's who you that's who we're after that locks a lot of things up
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:13.800]  and then the all of a sudden the the true believers in what they're doing aren't
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.640]  going to be true believers anymore they're not just shoving housewives
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:21.200]  around anymore it's not fun anymore yeah I'd say that all sudden it's real
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:27.080]  serious I just can't believe the communists with a bunch of crazy bankers
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:31.600]  they're going to try this I mean they are nuts man I tell you fortune favors
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.000]  the bold they know that well good talking to you interesting call from Kentucky
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.440]  Michael knows what he's talking about you know they're gonna have a lot of

[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.360]  give up its basic liberties and freedoms they were fighting al-qaeda which they
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:23.500]  ran and controlled that's all public now now they flipped it on to real
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:28.360]  libertarians and conservatives that are anti-war pro-gun groups property rights
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.920]  groups and it's mainstream news today it's a point for wars dot com that they're
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:35.640]  telling Christians you can't give the tea party or evangelical groups or you'll
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:39.120]  be arrested in court-martialed that's totally illegal you can't tell troops
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.000]  they can't do that but this is the political persecution that Obama has
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.080]  been carrying out but here's the thing Nixon tried some of this stuff some of
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.800]  this stuff happened during Iran Contra with daddy Bush running it wanting to
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:57.240]  test using COG to have a coup d'etat this is happening throughout history
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:00.960]  always governments try to take over criminal elements of the governments
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:05.840]  just because this is all happening now and it's happening a level I've never
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:11.600]  seen before so it is very dangerous doesn't mean we're gonna have a civil
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:16.680]  war and all this stuff we need peace folks I will do everything I can to not
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:20.120]  let them provocateur something or all the racial division the rest of it now
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:24.640]  John Perkins is an expert on this and I won't go over his whole bio he's with
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:29.280]  us about 45 after I'll get back to your your calls John Perkins org he's a
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.000]  New York Times what is it number one best-selling author of Confessions of an
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:39.800]  Economic Hitman he was a chief economist and advised the World Bank and the
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.960]  United Nations and the US Treasury Department for Jeff owner corporations
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.840]  and he's got a whole bunch of best-selling books on the subject and
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:52.280]  they would send him in to try to get countries third world old world to sign
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.360]  over their infrastructure and basically be financially robbed and enslaved or he
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:00.520]  would then send in the jackals who were basically folks who would overthrow the
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.800]  country so the exact subject we're talking about here in America it's the
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:08.200]  banksters that aren't free market that that are monopolistic to do this and
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:14.240]  you know we see now in Obama the embodiment of Madison Avenue hype where
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:18.080]  he's gotten away with things that Bush could never dream of so it's not that
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:23.120]  Bush was good it's that Obama is the more effective of evils and John Perkins
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:27.080]  in a nutshell for us in a longer segments coming up seeing what's happening
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:31.360]  with the bank looting worldwide seeing what's happening with Obamacare not
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.080]  trying to give people actual health care but just pay money to foreign you know
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:40.160]  insurance companies or whatever I mean as an expert on this what do you think's
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.440]  really going on and how can you tie your decades of running hitman operations
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:49.800]  economically into what you see as a hitman as an economic hitman now making
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.240]  pittance for what you've done and I think doing a great job what do you see
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:58.160]  as a as a mechanic what do you see hey well Alex first of all good to be with
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:03.160]  you again you know I think I go back to my own theme that it's really not the
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:07.240]  US government that's behind this it's the big corporations and that's where we
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:11.520]  really have to look at our leverage points how do we how do we move the big
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:16.960]  corporations let's face it today our president doesn't really have that much
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:21.760]  power our Congress doesn't have that much power their finance their campaigns
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.200]  of finance by big corporations and they become essentially servants of those
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:29.000]  corporations and so if we really want to change things that's where we have to
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  look and you know I'm not trying to let Obama off the hook or Bush or anybody
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.200]  else off the hook except to say that the reality of the situation today is that
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:40.920]  we don't have a democracy we don't have a representative democracy you know
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.520]  during most of my lifetime I think it'd be fair to say that our elected
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:47.360]  officials wrote the laws but they don't anymore not the important laws the
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:51.080]  important laws are written by corporate lobbyists pass through the politicians
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:56.400]  whom they control and that's what happens so our democracy has really been
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:00.120]  robbed by a bunch of robber barons and I think it's really really important for
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.240]  us to understand that almost all of these issues that you're addressing all
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:06.960]  the very very important issues at some point in time they go back to the
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:12.200]  corporations making huge windfall profits off us the 1% once again
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:17.680]  exploiting the 99% it's actually more like 0.001% exploiting the
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:25.480]  99.0 whatever you know 99.999% so I think we really need to look at where
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:29.360]  these leverage points are that in order to change government we've got to
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:35.280]  understand that we've got to go after big corporations I agree with you I talk
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:41.280]  about Obama because he's used as the diversion to carry all this out and it's
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.320]  kind of like a closer at the end of a baseball game and and I agree that as we
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:51.000]  whether it be on the real left or real right or libertarian whatever we're all
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.680]  targeted because we're independent and really trying to get justice and these
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.260]  corporations are trying to convert us over to an authoritarian model that you
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:04.240]  saw carried out in the third world exactly you know and in fact we're
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.480]  meeting the definition of fascism when we go this route or at least one of the
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:12.240]  definitions as many definitions but that's one of them you know it's
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.600]  interesting Alex I speak to some extremely conservative organizations
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.560]  around the world I just came back from Southeast Asia from Europe from the
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.960]  Middle East from Latin America and I also speak to some extremely liberal
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:28.240]  progressive organizations it's really interesting to me how the two extremes as
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:31.920]  well as what's in the center invites me to talk and one of the things that
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.960]  stay there come back and tell us about that but I think that's that's what
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:38.640]  happens when you get down to survival when you get down to a crisis people
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.160]  really start getting hey it's these mega banks it's these big corporations that
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.600]  are bigger than most governments that literally are above the law and are

[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:15.760]  economic hitman best-selling author really blew the doors years ago wide
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:21.040]  open on a lot of the secret operations that go on and so much of it since he
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:26.320]  went public has now been released declassified admitted it's organized
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.800]  crime ladies and gentlemen that we're facing and he went through his own
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:33.000]  realization John briefly they want you to get know what you're talking about how
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.760]  we fix this what you see happening worldwide right now how you see an
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:40.080]  awakening but just briefly how did you begin to awaken you've told that
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:44.800]  briefly before but I think it's important to know that that that you know you get
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.960]  into a system incrementally all the sudden you go from being a good guy to
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:51.520]  doing really bad things then the process of coming back to being good again
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:56.080]  almost like Darth Vader to use that analogy and that's your story is really
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.880]  the story of how we can probably even get those in the system to to put the
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:04.520]  brakes on things take Joseph sticklets you know blowing the whistle as well
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.040]  yeah yeah yeah it's interesting because to Nobel laureates
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:14.280]  Stiglitz and Krugman but both have recently said that economics is not at
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.320]  all about what we're taught in an economic school it's not about supply and
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:21.760]  demand it's it's all about being run by politics where they didn't quite go is
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:26.120]  to say but politics is run by big corporations so our whole economic
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:29.560]  system is run by big corporations it has nothing to do with with supply and
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:35.200]  demand it could but under the the current laws and regulations it does not and
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.080]  I just want to I want to comment on what you said about it's run by
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:45.560]  organized crime that the big difference is that unfortunately these guys aren't
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.480]  committing crimes they write the law that's right so they let write laws that
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:53.840]  allow them to get away with what should be crimes but in fact for the most part
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.080]  they're not breaking any I agree but the Nazis put stuff on the books that they
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.440]  got hung for just because they have some you know 10 badges and write some stuff
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:07.240]  up doesn't mean it really doesn't break basic universal law no you know in fact
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.960]  you think about organized crime you think about the prohibition and what
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.320]  organized crime was doing at that point was actually something that soon became
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:17.960]  legal sure so they weren't really doing anything all that bad in a way although
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.560]  they were certainly killing people with all the mobses you're right so I
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:24.640]  shouldn't compare organized crime to the bankers that's insulting organized crime
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:29.960]  you're right it is the bankers are so much smarter than organized crime that
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:32.640]  they don't have to actually commit crimes they can't they don't go to jail we
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:35.160]  all know they're not going to jail they should be in jail they're not going to
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:40.520]  jail so anyway you know I realized after as I went through this process of being
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:44.080]  an economic hit man and I did that only for 10 years and at the beginning I
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:46.560]  thought I was doing the right thing you know it's what's taught in business
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.000]  schools but as I went through it I saw that what I was doing was really was
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.280]  criminal even though it's legal criminality and that that what I was
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.440]  doing was just helping that that notorious infamous 1% which is actually
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.800]  about less than 1% get richer and richer and get making the rest of us poorer
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:08.120]  and poorer destroying the middle class in fact and you know I think one of the
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:11.200]  things we have to do is to let the corporations know the widget is not
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.280]  going to buy from them as long as they keep supporting these draconian
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:20.080]  fascistic policies we do have control the marketplace is a voting booth it's
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.600]  it's a the marketplace is a democracy if we will just look at it that way and use
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:29.640]  it that way and put pressure on these people and you know I think this is so
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:35.160]  important and to have the discussion that we're having now it is a very
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:38.200]  viable way of making this happen we have to put pressure on these
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.720]  corporations and I think we have to recognize that in the past you needed
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:48.440]  you needed a gun in order to take out a president Kennedy you know everybody
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.720]  knew Kennedy was having affairs with lots of amazing women Marilyn Monroe
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:55.480]  and Angie Dickinson and interns in the White House and so on it didn't matter
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:59.120]  but by the time Clinton came along you know they could impeach a president for a
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:03.080]  sex scandal and then the head of the IMF was taken out for the same reason he had
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:08.120]  an obvious weakness and they found it I think we know today that Obama or
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:14.440]  McCain or anybody else that can be taken down by a sex scandal or a drug
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:19.240]  scandal or an embezzlement scandal and it doesn't even have to be true it could
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:23.720]  be you know the FBI could create this very easily and send out a message to
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:27.640]  the to the mainstream media you can destroy a president you can destroy a
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.040]  senator and I think they're all aware of this so it's very important for us to
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:38.000]  realize that we the people have to take have to take control we are the ones with
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.240]  the power our leaders don't have that kind of power that's right there's such
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:45.320]  puppets the NSA takes the data gives it to select corporations in in these
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:49.760]  files to them blackmail people hey you cheated on your wife ten years ago do
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:53.960]  you want her to know about that justice fine give us the vote we want hey
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:59.040]  police chief we know about you being in a unit 20 years ago that took some drug
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.440]  money we know you're not really corrupt but still you're gonna go to jail for it
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:08.440]  I mean that's why they use these databases on record that's why all this
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:14.560]  spying and stuff is so bad because it creates a panoptagonic system that
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.800]  really gives a power to the corporate tyrants that nobody's ever had before
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:24.400]  yeah exactly you know we were hearing about how the NSA spying now is
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:27.480]  impacting our relationships with Germany and lots of other countries
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:32.400]  Brazil lots of countries but what we're not hearing very much about is how this
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:37.640]  can be used against the 16 year old kid today who you know in a couple of
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:41.160]  decades decides he wants to run for the Senate or president or be police chief
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.160]  as you said and somebody goes back into his files and sees that when he was
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.880]  14 or 15 or 16 or something he sent a naked picture of himself or said
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:53.400]  something that for an adult would be inappropriate but for a teenager might
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.240]  just be you know going along with the system he has some girl to be his friend
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:01.080]  without benefit who knows the fact of the matter is what we haven't been
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:05.280]  discussing very much and I wish we would is how all of these files on young
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.440]  people today can be used against them in the future not necessarily to keep them
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:12.600]  out of office maybe even to help them get in office but once they're in office
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:16.360]  they have complete control over them okay now you're senator now you're
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.360]  president we got you if you want to if you want to maintain your job if you
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:23.760]  want to keep your marriage if you want to keep your life then you better play
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:27.080]  our game or we're gonna expose something you did back when you were 16 years old
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:32.360]  what is the end game I mean I think it comes down to for us if somebody's
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:35.960]  doing good for the people and what's common sense don't listen to the
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:41.480]  scandals that are so obvious anymore we just made up tripe the real crime is the
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:45.760]  big organized syndicate but hey I want to ask what our end game should be but
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.840]  be what is the big corporate hedge fund Goldman Sachs JPMorgan Chase what is
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.480]  their end game because I see the things they're doing it's so authoritarian it's
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:02.680]  so draconian it's so anti-free speech it's so anti-journal journalism and I
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:06.040]  just don't know why these guys think that they're gonna get out of building a
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:11.320]  bear trap like this history shows the tyranny they're creating and the end of
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:15.760]  due process they're creating and of separation of powers and balance of power
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:20.560]  is a black hole that is going to destroy them as well there's no way they're
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:25.640]  gonna get out of this I agree with you Alex but I don't think they they believe
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:29.240]  that and of course a lot of them will get out of it already have gotten out of
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.480]  it as individuals they retire with their golden parachutes and whatever in the
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:38.440]  long run the system's going to collapse it has to and but in the short run a lot
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:42.280]  of people in what process get very powerful and make a lot of money what
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:47.720]  drives them you know I don't know but what drives a quarterback in a football
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.920]  game when he's way ahead to one score one more touchdown you know I mean it
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:55.600]  seems to be part of human character in a way to want more and more and more
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:00.440]  more but beyond that the measuring stick for these corporate executives is money
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:05.320]  and power and so if you work for Goldman Sachs and last year you you only
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:11.960]  made 15 million dollars but the guy at the next desk over made 18 million you
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:16.200]  want to beat him this next year the two of you have this rivalry going that's
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:20.520]  right you're not thinking about two or three steps down what you're doing what
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.040]  it's causing you're literally just had three wives and one of them just took
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.960]  ten million dollars you had in the bank and she want to make 20 million more
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:32.920]  exactly and you get together for beers after work or whatever you have you play
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:36.440]  these games and they were they talk about hey how did you sell today how much
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.840]  money did you make today blah blah blah blah blah so to hell with a consumer to
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:46.440]  hell with the public you know just keep building up winning scoring that next
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:51.480]  touchdown it just becomes part of our system and I think what what you know
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:55.000]  your message is what all of that the message all of us it has to be is that
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.040]  we got to create something better listen we have created an adjunct failed
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:03.880]  global economy you know if there's no question about it it can't go on like
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:07.200]  well that was my next question you're a smart guy most the experts we talked to
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:11.320]  say the prognosis goes from bad to worse economically where would you put the
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:15.280]  world economy what do you expect to happen with this QE unlimited all the
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.360]  things we see happening here I know you've written about seeing it on a
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:23.760]  smaller model in the old and first world you know you know they can keep
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.560]  building it back up in the short term stocks go up it looks like the economy
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:34.480]  is growing and yet the middle class is still worse off every day more foreclosures
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.960]  high unemployment the statistics that show that we're gaining are really
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:42.360]  statistics that show that the very wealthy are gaining and and the the
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:46.480]  economics statistics in our country are very skewed to the very very wealthy that
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:51.600]  one percent that controls so much of the resources so we really need to go into
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:57.000]  this and and look deeply and say hey the job of corporations that who control
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:03.240]  the world is to serve a public interest not to serve that one percent and we
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:08.680]  have this control you know you you reach so many people and you reach consumers
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:12.400]  women are the big consumers you know they buy a lot of things consumer groups
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:16.200]  they'll go out there and and state of these corporations hey cut it out we're
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:20.040]  only going to buy from the ones that are going to serve our interests yes make a
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.920]  decent rate of return for your investors because that's how we develop
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:27.200]  better systems and let's face it we need a lot of better systems we need to move
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:32.800]  into an economy that's based on cleaning up pollution and creating better
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:38.440]  systems for transportation communications energy banking we know
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:42.200]  let's get rid of that banking system and get into a new one better systems are
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.920]  for treating sick people all kinds of things you know we can create a better
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.360]  economy but we the people have to be the ones to make that work because our
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.840]  leaders just are not going to do it and even if they want to do it they can't do
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:45:01.640]  it they don't have that kind of power I agree with you so it's when the unmovable
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:06.600]  object comes into contact with the unstoppable force they're going to try
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:12.720]  to start wars historically false flags stage terror let terrorists attack us to
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:17.760]  bring in the fear to pose our saviors they're openly cashing heavy weapons
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:23.760]  everywhere and openly now down to the down to the level of enlisted telling
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:27.680]  them the new enemy is the American people prepare for all this stuff I mean
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:32.280]  this is craziness and I see John Corzine making 40 to one bet with other
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:35.960]  people's money and not getting in trouble I mean I really think just like
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:41.560]  Hitler and and other crazy kleptocrats I think these guys just think they're
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:44.440]  invincible and I think they're gonna probably I think there's a good chance
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:48.400]  they're gonna start World War three or something I think they're that nuts yeah
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:52.800]  you know you talked about letting the terrorists attack us but what about you
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:58.560]  know encouraging the terrorist to attack us you know this what's going on in
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:01.600]  Syria I think it's very disturbing that in fact we seem to be in a position
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:05.560]  where we're going to be arming and supporting al-Qaeda and I don't like a
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:09.640]  sod at all I don't like the Syrian regime but I don't think the answer is to
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:15.640]  to you know basically arm the enemy and support the enemy well exactly let me
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:18.480]  ask you this in closing and then talk about your website and your latest book
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:22.240]  and then we'll let you get going I appreciate your time John I've studied
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:26.200]  history I haven't been around that long you know I'm just 40 years old but I say
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:29.400]  a lot of history and I've been on the air 18 years a lot of things happen the
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:36.920]  elites now seem more reckless and and more wild and more crazy than they've
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:41.360]  ever been and I just see it on thousands of different points like DU they
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.160]  wouldn't let him use DU 25 years ago then they started letting him use it now
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:47.280]  they use it at local shooting ranges I mean it's a death sentence whoever uses
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:53.360]  it on record it's just on thousands of points used to they didn't let reactors
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:58.480]  you'll have 91% of the reactors publicly leaking worldwide and the US is the
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:03.560]  worst I mean it seems like there really is Max Kaiser calls them suicide
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:07.880]  bankers or suicide stockbrokers where the guy knew he was probably gonna die in
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:11.600]  the towers but he stayed at the terminal to make you know $20 million extra I
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:17.920]  mean they it's pathological they are mentally ill I really think yeah you
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:22.280]  know Max I I traveled around Ireland and part of England for a while with Max
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:28.320]  a little over a year ago what amazing guy yeah you know I think they're they're
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.360]  desperate I think to a certain degree what's going on is that they're
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:34.880]  understanding that we're digging in and I think we should take energy from that
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:38.560]  it's kind of like a keto you know when your energy when you're when your
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:42.760]  opponent exerts a lot of energy against you you you turn it back around so I
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:45.840]  think I think part of what's happening now is that they're beginning to
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:49.720]  understand that the between the Tea Party and the Occupy movement that the
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:53.360]  extreme right the extreme left there they're all incredibly dissatisfied and
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:56.040]  everybody in the middle of the set all some of the people in the middle of just
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:00.400]  let's argue but but there but I think the status quo I think what I call the
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:03.840]  corporatocracy is understanding that they're in a desperate situation so
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:07.720]  they're trying to rape us up everything they can in the short run make make as
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:12.400]  much as they possibly can in the short run and also dig in to that is very
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:15.640]  profound because when I'm in a quiet place you're not on air and really
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:20.680]  thinking it isn't confidence we're seeing I agree with you I this is kind of a
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:24.960]  mad looting towards the end and also talk to a lot of elitist themselves that
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:28.880]  have apologized off record they were running five years ago saying it was
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.400]  all over and if you look they're all running to the middle of nowhere with
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:36.240]  you know armed guards and stuff I mean I I think you're right I think they know
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:40.280]  they're not going to get away with this I agree so so so we should get energy from
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:43.480]  this and we should we should take great hope in this and just keep up our story
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:47.240]  just renew it read me and they are it keep talking keep going on the air keep
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:51.000]  doing what you're doing Alex and and and again you know I think we have to
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.960]  recognize that that that the that the right and the left are our partners in
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:00.520]  this and and how do we come together in a way that will really make all of us
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:04.560]  force change here let me ask this final question and then talk about your new
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:08.520]  book what do you what do you think Obamacare really is I mean there's no
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:12.000]  way they put out something that doesn't work this bad and doubles the rates
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.120]  written by the insurance companies I mean I would prefer over this actually
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:19.280]  having you know like Northern European socialism and actually taking care of
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:21.640]  people that need health care but of course that's not what it is it's the
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.000]  same hedge funds that on the insurance companies from what I've seen stealing
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.440]  everybody's money I gotta tell you I've been traveling internationally for the
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:32.800]  last six months and I'm not up to date on it at all I don't feel very comfortable
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:39.320]  commenting on it but obviously we need something in this country so many people
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:42.720]  go without insurance I don't know what the right answer is to be honest with
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:46.160]  you Alex see how they use the crisis of an already corrupt healthcare system to
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:53.000]  make it even worse yeah I yeah you know that's not my thing my thing is let's go
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.800]  after the corporations on so many levels health care is just one of them and
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:00.280]  it's one that I'm not terribly familiar with sure plug the new book tell us about

[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:02.480]  attacking patriots and specifically they're trying to undermine fathers
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:07.520]  there are any any sense of alpha male in the house or in the community they
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:10.720]  want to tear it out because they want to prey on the women and children
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:15.120]  specifically that's right they're not gonna make Marines wear women's hats yes
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.640]  I mean these are a bunch of permits I'm sorry go ahead they humiliate us out
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:23.800]  here I'm in Los Angeles my son he goes to school in Culver cities eight years
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:28.920]  old and I had a principal actually tell me there at the school that government
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:33.600]  is the best thing to slice bread to raise our children and I had to debate
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:37.760]  him on that and tell him that you know what as an educator you should be ashamed
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:41.160]  even say something like that because the Constitution should have been in your
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:48.040]  curriculum at some standpoint during your tenure and at this stage it's we're
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:52.480]  sending out a SOS here from Los Angeles because we need Patriots here we need
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:56.120]  more people who stand on the Constitution this guy interrogated my son
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:00.840]  about the firearms that we have in our home and he then called the police
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:05.680]  Culver City PD they followed up with CPS CPS actually came out and said that the
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:10.920]  allegations were laughable they said that I was neglecting my children because I
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:16.280]  own firearms I know doctors call the CPS and again they're not liberals they're
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:21.400]  authoritarians and there's no law there's no nothing they send CPS and
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:24.040]  you're blessed you didn't get a bad one it's about half of them are really bad
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:28.360]  and they try to take your kids when you own legal guns I mean California is how
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:31.720]  the whole country is gonna be my friend you have to rescind your consent that
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:34.920]  was the first thing I said to him over the phone I said I resent my I resent
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:38.760]  my consent I don't give you any consent to come here or do anything and the
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:42.680]  lady these people speak a certain verbiage and a certain legalese that
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:46.880]  you have to stand up to them if you don't they're gonna roll over you they're
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:49.760]  gonna do what they want to and they're coming for our kids they're predators
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:53.720]  out there these people are predators and there's I know the child support system
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:58.840]  the welfare system the family courts the schools they're all in cahoots they all
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:03.200]  work together when you go to have a baby it's and they sit there and go and kick

[02:01:52.440 --> 02:02:00.200]  your take on all this last month we didn't go in I'm a reservist I also do
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.880]  a line-haul truck driving but we didn't go in last month so I haven't gotten a
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:10.080]  briefing like that yet but what I did get about September of last year
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:15.960]  September 1st in fact I just graduated from the truck driving school and they
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:20.800]  told me I had to be on a conference call I said look man I got 200 small miles
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:25.920]  get home do I have to have it my sergeant told me he said look there's a
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:31.800]  Homeland Security call you will be on it period so I'm going down the road I'm
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:38.400]  listening everything at their stand they set up a seaburn team Alex our
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:43.360]  entire mission was our area of operation is with everything west of the
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:48.240]  Mississippi and what seaburn is is a chemical nuclear you know weapons and
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:55.000]  stuff like that we were to respond to that and any of the national you know
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:59.040]  like these big up that natural disasters and stuff sure I want to be clear
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:04.760]  I've been following this 18 years that's the the EOD mission and the NBC
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:08.560]  mission is always the cover and then once you get to the briefings we have
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:11.800]  video of them then it shifts to domestic extremists and that's the real
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:16.680]  mission but go ahead yeah see that that's what you know that's always in the
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:22.880]  back of your mind and I'm hoping to God if that's not what this is but I mean
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:27.840]  me and a couple my buddies at my unit you know we're listeners we know my
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:32.760]  opportunity sergeant is you know he knows what's going on stuff he's he's the
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:35.520]  biggest security threat to the United States military let me tell you the
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:41.800]  information goes out he processes it and it goes right back out you know so he's
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:45.420]  been biting his tongue when I talk about it and you know we start looking at all
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:48.960]  the guys that are on this mission because we got attached to a different
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:54.440]  unit Alex I mean we're talking about combat arms you know tankers
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:04:00.960]  scouts infantry all old you know that that's their previous I told you it's
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:06.200]  not NBC going out and washing people off that's always the PR to acclimate the
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:10.440]  public to the military exactly no it that's the cover of the mission you're
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:15.800]  saying these are combat groups being prepared basically basically well that
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:21.120]  that was our previous job our new jobs are like you know 88 Mike and Bill was
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:26.400]  chemical stuff but you know most everybody is like their their new job is
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:32.560]  truck driving but their old stuff was combat arms and you know my dad didn't
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:37.040]  ask me Alex he's been asked me because I was one of you I was one of many

[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:44.520]  you get the idea that the iris is actually giving you a check even though
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:47.560]  on average you get back a lot less than you pay in they just want to set the
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:52.400]  present that they control your check it's all about I mean hardly any other
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:56.720]  country takes the money from you first you pay it after we're such slaves because
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:02.560]  we think we're so free what's the Bible verse none or so enslaved as those that
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:08.400]  think they are free let's go to Daniel in Minnesota whose army is in the
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:12.080]  National Guard and he's seeing a reorganization of everything that's happening
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:17.160]  and when you say the guys you know we're awake I mean what's been waking them
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:25.560]  up you know I honestly don't know Alex I mean these are all guys a lot of guys
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:30.440]  that are awake they're actually sadly you say our ex-navy but there are some of
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:35.320]  the best NCOs I've ever had you know it's just stuff that they've seen in the
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:39.440]  past it's stuff that they're seeing now is the you know that they can count one
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:42.640]  plus one equals two you know they're seeing a bigger picture they're not
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:48.000]  watching you know just this or that but you know it's just it's one of those
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.280]  things you know for each everybody it's something different and when you take a
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:56.080]  group like what we've been set up for and you put it all together and put us
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:01.400]  under Homeland Security and you know as soon as this happened was the what are
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:07.120]  the hurricane out on the East Coast we didn't get no calls for that you know
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:11.000]  since then we've had tornadoes up in Oklahoma you know not too far where we
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.120]  are because that's right your mission is preparing for combat against the
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:17.640]  American people and that's on record you're now under Homeland Security and
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:21.680]  they put a Department of Defense guy over that and it's this new fifth branch
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:27.440]  that answers to El Jefe whoever the president happens to be it is a classic
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:30.680]  takeover strategy and it may not happen under Obama it might happen in ten years
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:34.840]  under some new president but the point is I've never seen the orders going as
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.480]  low as the privates I mean just ten years ago or four or five years ago even
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:43.400]  this type of stuff was being tested with generals it wasn't going into lower level
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:46.880]  officers or even non-commissioned it's going all the way but finish your point
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:50.720]  about disarming people in Iraq because I remember reading several Pentagon
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:56.680]  documents and even a MIT report calling Iraq a laboratory for domestic
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:02.640]  operations in civil unrest gun confiscation even Army Times has reported
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:06.400]  on what they call brigade homeland and that mission so again what people are
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.760]  hearing for the first time as you've just tuned in all this is mainline
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:14.000]  documents we shot a special report last night I'll give people the name of in a
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:17.920]  moment I'm gonna tweet out the folks but tell us about gun confiscation what's
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:23.880]  that how that happens what that is like we we actually ran a 16 man platoon
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:29.640]  because we're the armor so that puts about maybe I'd say at most maybe ten of
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:34.440]  our guys on the ground and that you know either eight evenings or nice to pin on
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:39.440]  our shift Alex would go I mean house to house down a block kicking in doors or
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:44.560]  you know sometimes it was just as nice as you know knocking on it and then you
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:49.560]  know Chaka Makua BB and would go in and talk to him and while our lieutenant
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:53.000]  sitting there talking to him would be searching the house and whenever we found
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:57.480]  weapons would just take them I mean we and the people there was you know stupid
[02:11:57.480 --> 02:12:01.920]  enough we'd you know take a you know fake computer or something like and this
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:05.760]  is telling us that there's a weapon here where is it and then hand it to us you
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:10.760]  know but it's not always you know the aggression but when we hit something
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:14.760]  with aggression Alex you couldn't stop us we had our infantry hit a house two
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:19.640]  times kind of pick up a high ballad target they couldn't do it when we went
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:23.640]  in and ten men actually it was less than that I think it was six men on the
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:27.920]  ground that night we hit that house so hard that my sergeant he kicked the door
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:32.760]  it actually came off the hinges and this wasn't you know no light you know door
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:37.640]  it was a heavy door he kicked it off the hinges went in there and we was literally
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:41.560]  walking over top of people ran upstairs grab the dude before he get out of his
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:47.360]  bed and chunked him down the stairs you know it's a force that you can't really
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:52.360]  stop unless you fortified your doors and absolutely but once once a shooting
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:56.520]  war starts people are not going to sit in their house and wait as you know and
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:00.440]  of course most the Iraqis from what I've read tell me if I'm right we're not using
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:05.000]  their guns to actually attack forces that had invaded their country they were
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:10.560]  using it for self-defense they had had their own second amendment yeah I mean
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:14.880]  that that's basically what it is and I mean they can get AK-47 there you know
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:18.200]  cheaper than some of their food sometime you know cheaper than their medicine
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:21.960]  they're so abundant we used to take him our nickel-plated silver-plated with
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:27.720]  ivory and stuff on him it was you know just truly amazing but I mean that's the
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:33.520]  thing we have to stand together and I was talking to apparently a mutual person
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:39.880]  of ours and I wanted to ask you about him off-air a mutual person all right
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:45.080]  well yeah you're piped into the Minnesota phone system and then they pipe it
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:49.960]  through to me I just do that so I have backups and shadowed up links so so I'll
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:53.200]  put you on hold and you can relay the question at the break to John Harmon and
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:56.320]  then and then I can talk to you that way so put you on hold Daniel and come back
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:00.720]  to you off-air just John get the question and I'll relay it to you and
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:04.240]  then over to him I don't want to like pipe it through the system because
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:11.080]  sometimes I can go on the air like one chance out of a thousand I want to go
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:17.040]  back to the phone calls there's some breaking news will Obamacare grab your
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:25.600]  paycheck will it grab your bank account will Obamacare grab your tax refund you
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:28.960]  bet they will and that's how they're planning to do it they say there's a
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:32.360]  fine but they won't tell you how they're gonna get it well it's actually in the
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:37.520]  law and that report is up at drudgereport.com we're linking to it up on
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:43.280]  info wars.com right now we keep telling you that's in the law that's how this
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:51.280]  works now there is a report up on the website that I'm also gonna tweet out
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:15:00.560]  where we broke down last night in detail in a 15 minute report emergency alert
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.360]  soldiers warn of coming gun confiscation and I'm gonna have this
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:09.600]  reposted to info wars.com scrolled off the front page and I'm gonna tweet it
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:13.240]  out during the break to real Alex Jones because we've put these reports out
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:17.400]  before and they've gotten almost three million views which is great because
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:22.840]  it's not our regular three million listeners a day it's it's new people
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:26.120]  that end up seeing this it's military that end up seeing this then they get
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:29.760]  all the intelligence they'll see the emergency centers establishment act on
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:35.000]  the video they'll see the civilian inmate labor camp program they'll see
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:40.040]  Forbes magazine and AP admitting the military brasses is being prepared for
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:43.920]  gun confiscation so that it won't happen they want to be able to get it
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:48.560]  already line it up stage some big event and then roll it out we got to blow them
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:52.920]  up before their rocket gets off the ground and that's what we do here is we
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:56.920]  try to stop a civil war we try to stop bloodshed I got a wife and three kids I
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:16:00.920]  don't want looking for this I think we can fix things peacefully we're starting
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:04.240]  to win in the info war and they know that they're gonna start something big
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:09.600]  folks that's what I'm trying to get across to you the criminal interest that
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:15.760]  will make money off a civil war in a wrecked country and please to the police
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:19.680]  out there especially you a lot of you've been handpicked now because you're
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:24.280]  imperious and you know you you're very arrogant I'm a red very saddening it
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:27.720]  doesn't humiliate me when I see police being rude mean to people doesn't make
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:31.920]  me feel little like I'm being dominated it makes me sad for your ancestors and
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:39.160]  who you are and also if you guys continue where this is leading I mean it's
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:43.240]  leading somewhere really really bad so I'm gonna tell you again mr. I'm not
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:46.720]  looking for a fight and we're not looking for a fight mr. but you better
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:53.160]  stop there's the higher ups are offshore they think they're safe they think I
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:56.360]  mean they know full well what's gonna happen if this goes down and I know
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:00.320]  most police I talked to on the street are actually nice and say they're awake
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:05.880]  but then I run into cops constantly acting just wild and I get getting jacked
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:09.760]  up even on my own show you know doing a job it's easier to get the job done if
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:13.560]  you get jacked up but it's this whole attitude that you train like we're the
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:18.600]  enemy and we're the threat tyranny is the threat and and they treat some house
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:23.400]  wife like you know they do some guy was like prison tattoos on them and I'm
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:26.880]  just I'm done I'm tired of it I haven't done anything wrong I'm tired of being
[02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:32.160]  treated like I'm evil let's go to the Jason in Missouri whose army and police
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:36.480]  thank you for calling in and holding sir you're on the air I did it out I'm
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:40.160]  doing all right what is your take on all the stuff you've heard well I have five
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:44.200]  points that even if you got to hold me over you've got to hear I've got to get
[02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:47.720]  this out I'm calling from mid-Missouri I am prior army I was
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:57.120]  horribly discharged in 95 our unit and I was in a medical unit we received an
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:03.320]  involuntary survey form from our platoon sergeant you could not leave the
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.720]  facility with it matter of fact you couldn't even leave the gymnasium with
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:14.200]  it it was yes or no question to keep in mind 19 95 96 it's the latest the
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:18.920]  questions were as follows the ones that I remember would you fire upon American
[02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:24.120]  citizens armed would you fire upon American citizens unarmed would you
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:30.320]  quarantine American cities in times of national emergency so this was 95 and
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:34.520]  they were on a yellow card the equivalent of the backs like your
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:38.800]  checkbook that yellow card that's in the back every one of us filled it out so I
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:43.640]  would like to use your platform right now to reach out to all my previous
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:49.280]  veteran friends that know what I'm talking about this was mid-Missouri call
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:54.040]  in either call in on the hotline on info wars dot com leave your name your
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:58.040]  number that's how we're gonna get this out is to get enough veterans to come
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:04.280]  forward and say hey we've been probed 10 20 years ago for this very I'm gonna hold
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:07.520]  you over this is so important I'm gonna hold you over because we got plenty of
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:11.000]  time this hour and we're gonna get to everybody else's patiently holding as
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.760]  well but sir see this is how we're all compartmentalized that actually came out
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:23.360]  in the news then that that was happening and then a 29 palms professor a teacher
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:28.800]  put out a mock one so he could put it out public and not break the law he put
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:32.680]  a copy out but called it his own survey to see if they would do it and he said
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:36.240]  that I've interviewed him like we should get him back on I forget that
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:41.160]  gentleman's name but the point is is that this has been going on for a long long
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:45.360]  time and that's the good news is they tried this in the mid 90s under Clinton
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:50.560]  and now they're trying it again the problem is they've made some headway in
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:55.400]  20 years or 18 years on this I'm gonna come right back to you Jason don't hang

[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:30.160]  the special report is 16 minutes long it's up on info wars dot com but I'm
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:33.200]  gonna have it reposted under a new headline to get even more attention
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:38.240]  it's emergency alert soldiers warn of coming gun confiscation that's the
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:42.040]  special report from the nightly news last night but myself Rob do and many
[02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:45.600]  others with the whistleblowers and the documents of the mass gun
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:50.080]  confiscation plan I'm gonna have this reposted to info wars dot com but
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:55.680]  really the headline should read Obama prepares military for nationwide gun
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:01.440]  confiscation or Obama readies military for nationwide gun confiscation and
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:05.640]  then we will tweet that out once it's on info wars dot com because for military
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:09.520]  that's only gotten part of this this is this is not all of it it'd be hundreds
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:14.080]  of documents but there's a good 15 news articles and documents in there so that
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:17.440]  they can see the informational and then see it for themselves it's not just me
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:21.840]  up here saying all of this so that they can then add pieces of the puzzle as
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:25.640]  well but this is not even pieces of a puzzle now let's go back I'm gonna shut
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:28.800]  up for the rest of the segment and let Jason who's a police officer in
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:33.240]  Missouri he was talking about in 95 getting these cards we found the 29
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:39.880]  palms survey from 1994 let's put that on screen while he talks dealing with
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:44.480]  gun confiscation and the last question asking if they would indeed do that the
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:51.640]  combat arms survey but that was actually 1994 may 10th but let's go ahead now and
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:57.200]  go back to our guest and go ahead and finish see a major first point about
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:02.440]  that go ahead and make your other points okay well like I said I got several
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:05.360]  points that I've got to get off to you because it's been so hard to get on your
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:13.080]  show second point is I woke up to the your show specifically after the second
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:18.720]  election I guess my question would be at what point why was the big push for the
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:22.680]  state to succeed from the union that's how I discovered you all of a sudden
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:26.240]  after the second election maybe I was just asleep I always knew there was a
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:30.160]  certain level of tyranny since 88 since Bush senior made that comment my
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:33.320]  brother's been preaching to me do the New World Order but you never saw
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:37.200]  anything but I bear again I was lax today's ill which I think most of the
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:40.960]  country has been even being a veteran nothing ever really you know nothing
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:44.200]  ever really threatens us and I think that's one of the reasons we're in the
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:48.640]  situation we're in now so I do have one quick question to educate me as to what
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:52.840]  pushed you and Ron Paul to push the state to see me from the union that's
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:58.560]  when I woke up well when I said succeed it's in the Declaration of Independence
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:01.680]  it's not our right it's our duty that when the government's become destructive
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:07.160]  of our basic liberties that it's our job to create a new government well I like
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:10.920]  the old Republic it's obviously the best system out there most the story
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:17.040]  and agree and so I was saying let's not secede to end America let's secede to
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:21.400]  have the states pull back declare the Washington Fed gov illegitimate and
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:27.320]  occupied and captured to then reestablish the Republic and so that was
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:30.240]  the plan I developed a lot of constitutional scholars advisors to
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:34.680]  Congress like Dr. Edwin Vieira and countless others Lou Rockwell many
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:38.760]  others that concurred they said no your plan was actually talked about by
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:41.720]  Thomas Jefferson because they had problems then as well and said let's
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:45.400]  just abolish this again and do it again because you know it's like when
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:49.240]  something's really bad sometimes you got to tear down a house if it's rotten
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:54.640]  and use the same blueprint that made it so good but do you see my point there
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:59.240]  yeah exactly and I agreed with you I just didn't understand because I hadn't
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:02.400]  been paying attention and that was my question I was if I could have high-fived
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:06.440]  just I would be like good you know good job brother actually I texted you a
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:12.320]  bunch I was I was for two months for two months my wife can tell you I was
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:18.760]  deep in following you you and just trying to catch up I was so far behind
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:22.840]  the eight ball and keep in mind I'm a police officer I'm a veteran and I was
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:27.020]  behind the eight ball I was asleep at the wheel so when at the point that I
[02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:31.880]  woke up right right after the second election I went on to YouTube and it
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:36.320]  was just to use your phrase that you coined it was unbelievable I'm like
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:40.640]  why are we not seeing this stuff on Fox News well then I'm educated to the point
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:45.920]  for all ball off it's too late for that so coming through the timeline how I
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:52.280]  was I was just 24 hours a day I was just living this trying to learn as much as I
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:57.480]  could from you because you were the primary one by the way that's a normal
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:01.840]  that's a normal response to when you when I found out about this stuff I've
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:05.720]  been on the air a couple years I was more like a mainline libertarian and then
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:09.760]  all said I had police and military giving me all this info and people thought
[02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:13.680]  I was crazy but I had all the documents and I witnessed it we're almost out of

[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:25.520]  news just the headlines I haven't gotten to yet a bunch of new breaking news as
[02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:30.160]  well just remember they're not just training to confiscate the firearms and
[02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:36.080]  admitting it they're telling troops you can't give money to a tea party group
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:39.360]  and that's totally illegal that's like the mafia that's racketeering to tell
[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:43.280]  people what they can and can't do in their own lives that's legal and we're
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:46.640]  gonna court-martial you if you're an evangelical Christian or give money to
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:53.360]  it that's Fox News reporting that and I already knew about this from sources and
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:57.800]  and had been some of the news earlier this year but it's just I can't even
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:03.640]  believe how criminal the people are that run this government and we cannot sit
[02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:07.280]  there and follow their orders so real fast Jason in Missouri police officer
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:11.840]  former army dropping the bombshell go over your points but I got to ask you
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:15.280]  briefly because this is what I've been told by others and we know they're doing
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:18.680]  it now I mean it's on record they're training for it and gun confiscation we
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:23.040]  had the Navy Seal on two days ago covering it but when you're in there
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:27.840]  being asked will you fire on American citizens to engage what unit you can be
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:33.080]  stuck in because if you say yes you get promoted obviously it's total evil what
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:37.440]  were people saying after you guys walked out of the gymnasium being asked if you
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:41.360]  would fire on American citizens or confiscate their guns and I thought
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:44.640]  about that because I figured you might ask me that or another caller might ask
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:48.640]  that honestly it's been so long ago I don't remember however I do remember
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:52.520]  everybody felt very uneasy which one of the last point that I'm gonna make this
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:56.800]  has happened again with somebody that I know who's in the Navy and I'll tell you
[02:34:56.800 --> 02:35:01.520]  his response to his dad let me so I can get off here so the next guy called us
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:05.640]  let me finish my point I was speaking with a Missouri State senator who I had
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:11.560]  met through my other job and he I said sir what's going on in Washington I was
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:15.800]  told he was a senator he said oh no I'm a state Missouri State senator he said
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:19.400]  but I know what you mean I was like man and I told him about you I told him about
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:25.120]  what I learned he confirmed everything about you in agenda 21 he said it is so
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:29.720]  bad he said that he was thinking about getting out and I said well why we need
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:33.440]  good people like you in there he looked me straight in the eyes Alex and this is
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:39.080]  exactly what he said and I quote he said I will have nothing to do with what is
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:44.640]  fixing to befall the American people and my stomach come up in my throat his wife
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:49.640]  is to his left she's crying I said have I done something she said no she said I
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:55.160]  fought this for years I thought he was just nuts about this stuff but she said
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:59.600]  what I have learned being a senator's wife she said I know that it's a hundred
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:05.800]  percent fact he said immediately start stockpiling guns water food and ammo he
[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:09.280]  said that's all I can tell you I so what do we do what do we you know is there
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:13.520]  something we can do at the state level he said I'm gonna inform you what I know
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:18.360]  he said the Missouri State Senate had already at that point now this was last
[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:22.760]  the week of Christmas last year this is prior to any of the shooting he said the
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:27.080]  Missouri State Senate had already voted to succeed from the Union but our
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:32.880]  governor said not yet I said well what are we waiting for he said well he said
[02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:37.320]  that's a good question he said but there is a plan in place to remove him from
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:42.840]  power if need be that he said I cannot discuss anything further I've been
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:46.080]  trying to call into the show for month did let you know this well no I know this
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:49.880]  stuff's all going on I mean even David Dewhurst his former top CIA and
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:53.880]  establishment says the government's pure evil has lost credibility and has to be
[02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:58.680]  removed because they're going to wreck it's going to be a red takeover again
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:02.760]  it's foreign banks doing it but they're gonna use a red takeover agenda and
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:07.960]  they're really planning it and the Civil War is because enough cops the
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:11.840]  military will follow the orders to start a civil war and enough citizens are
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:17.200]  gonna end up going abs who just waiting and are fed up it's gonna be a
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:22.480]  disaster and then the commies are gonna just wait while we kill each other and
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:27.080]  then come in later and then the foreign banks have set this all up and that's
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:33.200]  basically what people are talking about and there's the Atlantic wire who
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:39.400]  news the session again on the agenda in Missouri and it basically you know
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:44.720]  breaks down what you were just talking about from last year so I appreciate
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:50.240]  your call sir yes that's why at that time I called for the second American
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:55.080]  Revolution in the Info War to have the states pull out the feds will say it's
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:58.880]  illegitimate we counter you're not even a federal government because you are
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:02.040]  supposed to have the feds keep the states in check the states keep the feds
[02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:06.040]  in check balance of power just like two sides of Congress just like the
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:11.000]  judiciary the legislative the executive the fourth the state the media the fifth
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:14.840]  the state the juries I mean you're supposed to have all these checks and
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:19.640]  balances or you you always if you have one power structure you can have a good
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:24.360]  king or a good leader they're going to die people the bad guys are going to kill
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:28.960]  them in a palace coup to put bad guys in that's why you almost always get bad
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:33.840]  guys with a centralized system they've had a few dozen good kings philosopher
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:38.840]  kings in world history the last six thousand recorded year six thousand
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:44.840]  recorded years of history and you do get incredible leaps forward during those
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:49.280]  periods not not to the philosopher kings the way to go but compared to the
[02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:55.080]  horrible corrupt systems they had of corrupt a royal families and their
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:59.440]  their courts if you ever got a king who actually wanted to empower people and
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:03.520]  really inform people and really build things and really even it was for their
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:08.000]  own arrogant reasons you would get incredible civilizations out of that
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:14.240]  well a free society a free market society will create so much wealth the
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:20.520]  problem is you then become decadent so how do you how do you gauge that to be a
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:27.400]  free market society that's incredibly rich but then the corruption sets in and
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:34.560]  so that's why we pull out now the states all pulled out and said the new
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:38.120]  order captured us foreign banks captured us we're gonna do like Iceland did we're
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:43.120]  gonna forget all this foreign debt communist Chinese you know you actually
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:48.400]  are owed two trillion dollars we will pay you that back that's nothing with the
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:51.720]  faith and credit of the US if we don't let them wreck us they want to wreck us
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:56.160]  so bad shut not the power plants shutting off the infrastructure shutting off
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:40:01.480]  the the jobs bringing in the giant third world populations to be client state
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:07.520]  groups they want to blow our engine out so they can capture us and basically if
[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:11.440]  we were a ship use the corny Star Wars analogy got the Star Destroyer chasing
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:14.520]  the counselor ship they're shooting at each other they want to blow the engine
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:19.200]  so they can suck us up but America is big I mean it's like trying to eat an
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:24.360]  elephant and so they got a problem and now they're already collapsing the world
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:28.280]  system to bring in the world government but everybody's awake to them who
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:33.760]  matters and so it's the Mexican standoff that I talked about earlier where
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:38.440]  we're both pointing guns at each other basically and we need to convince people
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:43.920]  out there that the rights look even if we were going to lose ladies and gentlemen
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:49.760]  even if we were going to lose we would have to say no to this because it's so
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:53.680]  horrible what the in game of it is I said I go to your calls William whose
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:57.040]  police thank you for holding from Tennessee William what is your take on
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:02.040]  all this yes sir I had some just different information I'd like your last

[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:10.200]  writing at my department and we got a cops grant which is an acronym for
[02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:16.400]  community oriented policing and the government has put out a basically I
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:21.640]  could survey and for us to keep the grant and to be eligible to get more
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:26.520]  federal assistance we're supposed to complete these surveys are supposed to
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:31.240]  go door-to-door and we're asking a lot of outlandish questions that have caused
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:35.040]  me great alarm yeah basically it's an it's a knock-and-talk to get the federal
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:39.640]  money which then conditions the public and the police to have non-traditional
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:45.400]  police activities you're now be given a political police officer Soviet commas
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:50.080]  our job this is commas our training it's going on nationwide tell folks about it
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:55.760]  if it's a bunch of just random questions about how many people are in your
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:01.960]  household how many people have medical conditions do you have any firearms it's
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:06.720]  and then there's some standard questions about you know gross income and this is
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:16.080]  all done on a voluntary I'm sorry I just got cut off no no you're there you're
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:24.040]  there it's done on a voluntary you know basis but it's we're intimidating to the
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:27.720]  public and it's just the just the way things have gone over the last couple
[02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:33.080]  years and it's just it's horrible and it's it's definitely something that I
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:38.800]  didn't know if we're like being a test market or this is happening nationwide
[02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:42.600]  have you heard anything else about this yes sir they call it knock-and-talk
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:47.480]  under federal grants that started about 15 years ago but police departments just
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:51.560]  started refusing the money because they did it in Dallas they did it in Austin
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:54.560]  they did it all over Texas where they would come and knock and say we like to
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:43:00.560]  inspect your guns and see if they're safe in Boston and in New York they
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:05.560]  actually forced their way in they've got units of police that'll do that to go I
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:08.520]  don't care I want to see if there's guns to get the federal money and they put
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:12.120]  that on the news you can pull up knock and talk in Boston you can actually find
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:16.120]  it on YouTube and it shows the families being basically forcing their way in
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:19.640]  kind of like federal grants in the police department once the federal grant
[02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:24.280]  they've got to set up a checkpoint that's not a checkpoint but it really is
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:29.400]  just ask if you want to give some DNA and then people get so scared they do it
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:33.240]  and and again it's priming the pump just like if you're about to start a lawn
[02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:38.440]  mower and you hit the button a couple points to prime it with gas you so so
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:42.720]  yeah they slipped that gun question in there and really they're probing the
[02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:46.760]  departments to see if you comply they're probing the officers to see if you can
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:50.920]  comply they're conditioning you to do things you don't like that we're all
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:56.920]  being socially engineered we're all being hammered and yes it's going on
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:01.200]  under different guys is so knock and talk was so unpopular starting three years
[02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:07.120]  ago in select areas they started having the police go out and call it
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:11.320]  community survey assistance in the documents I saw I think it was out of
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:16.680]  Missouri speaking of Missouri and they go to the door and then they say oh we
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:20.920]  just got a few questions for you ma'am as a supplement to the census and
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:24.320]  community policing and again real community completing is where the cops
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:27.960]  got a beat everybody knows him you know the cops is there and throws the
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:31.120]  football with you in the front yard we didn't have a call like you know folks
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:37.080]  growing up 50 60 years ago this is the opposite of that this is spy policing
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:46.320]  this is interrogation policing this is not community policing I have a copy of
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:50.120]  that form if there's a way I can get it to you guys if you'd like it for your
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:57.080]  records yes sir CC at the show tips and info wars dot com and I'm going to put
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:03.400]  you on hold here for a moment and I'm gonna give you one of the emails that
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:07.960]  isn't that doesn't get thousands of data make sure we don't lose it and
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:11.920]  obviously it's not wrong for you to show me that form but still they might mess
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:15.920]  with you I would advise you because it'll just give the NSA more trouble to
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:22.120]  pay with cash from someplace and and scan it there and send it to us or usured
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:25.240]  I don't want to sit there I mean you should be able to send me that just make
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:27.880]  the decision whether you want to know or not because we just tell everybody
[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:30.960]  something right now they watch everything that comes in here I mean it's
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:35.400]  unbelievable so I mean they follow me around when I leave here it's a lot of
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:39.200]  so I live like a little I'm not even worried about it whatever but but the
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:45.680]  point is is that yes please send me that show tips at info wars dot com and then
[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:49.640]  I'm gonna put you on hold and then I'm gonna tell John Harmon cover my mouth
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:52.920]  here which email to send that to so thank you very much don't hang up William
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:46:04.760]  I'm gonna go on hold here okay fantastic I just gave in fact John already knew
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:08.800]  which email to send it to and send that to me I mean if I was a cop I wouldn't
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:13.760]  care if they're gonna mess with your go to your department and and try to you
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:17.080]  know put you on a list because you sent us their little federal thing there's
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:21.080]  nothing wrong it's not a secret document I'm just saying obviously the cop knows
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:25.520]  that but just I want to remind people somebody comes to work here I tell them
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:29.680]  up front you might end up getting put in a gulag down the road if we lose this
[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:34.000]  thing so I'm not kidding so just just know and if they ever think they can
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:40.680]  intimidate you they will try so and everybody just commits I mean it's
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:44.280]  surprising how much courage the average person has when they know they're in the
[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:47.400]  right but they need a community of people to stand together and that's why
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:51.640]  police chiefs are becoming little federal minions more and more because
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:56.800]  they should stand behind officers just to be good people I mean come on this is
[02:46:56.800 --> 02:47:03.240]  not rocket science to do this kind of stuff so yes also they're using those
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:08.520]  databases to index them with the census and to see how you answered the forms
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:11.160]  it's kind of like companies will give you a psychological test a couple times
[02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:16.040]  you know to see how you answer different times to try to see what type of person
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:20.200]  you are I mean there's just a lot of a lot of guinea pig stuff going on notice
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:24.200]  government it's all secret and if you want to ask the government a question
[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:28.400]  you're evil but then it wants to know everything you're doing that's backwards
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:32.240]  we should know what the government's doing they shouldn't know what we're
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:39.800]  doing until we go out and do something wrong and until we become a known
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:45.520]  perpetrator then then the new process you know starts to go out the window a
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:49.720]  little bit because you're a known quantity well these governments are known
[02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:56.240]  quantities ladies and gentlemen these governments are out of control not just
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:48:00.640]  ours every other one it's like a person you will die governments will get taken
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:05.240]  over and become corrupt I'm surprised how long ours has survived it's had a lot
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:08.840]  of problems it's been corrupt but I mean this is a takeover this isn't the
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:12.600]  American establishment doing this this is the end of this republic we're going
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:19.160]  to break we're going to talk to Leslie when we come back says survey about bomb
[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:22.160]  threats yeah they're doing those everywhere to create a climate of fear
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:26.960]  we're going to go to a truth raider and then the others I'll get to everybody
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:30.800]  that's on the board now but no more calls after that Kurt said Lindsay Jason and
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:34.520]  truth raider I haven't plugged anything all day here on air or two hours 48

[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:23.520]  everybody's been trying and says we've never seen anything like it well that's
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:26.400]  because I found that it was very very special the way it's done it's patented
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:31.120]  and it really is amazing its survival shield known as the fluoride detox in

[02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:47.600]  weed that has the wide spectrum natural iodine nascent iodine because they
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:51.560]  absorb it that way so it's in the metabolized form in there and is also
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:55.920]  very very dynamic and very very powerful and some people can't handle that you

[02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:32.720]  Tennessee is on lockdown after shooting local media reported Navy officials
[02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:38.400]  confirmed that the incident was near the Naval support activity in Millington
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:44.760]  NBC station WMCTV in Memphis citing city officials reported that at least two
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:49.640]  people had been shot near the base that they were both reportedly in non-critical
[02:54:49.640 --> 02:54:55.080]  condition well that's good news then oh nobody dies also NSA monitoring calls

[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:03.640]  they're spying on foreign leaders that's what they're supposed to be spying on not
[02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:10.640]  us I mean governments all spy on each other you don't spy on gun owners and
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:16.920]  Christians and and the associated pressure criminal government so but this
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:19.800]  is all becoming a big giant scandal and by the way all those governments are
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:25.600]  spying as well and I'm not endorsing all of this the point is espionage always
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:29.080]  goes on but the globalists run our government and they're engaged in espionage
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:32.360]  against American companies and individuals and people that aren't part of
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:36.200]  the globalist combine you understand that it isn't America doing this it's
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:42.440]  globalist using America's NSA to run all these scams everywhere to get dirt on
[02:55:42.440 --> 02:55:46.280]  people including Congress and that's come out in my six has been caught spying
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:50.200]  on the parliament to blackmail people I mean what do you think goes on with
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:55.280]  shadow government it's out of control let's go to Leslie in North Carolina
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:56:01.000]  you're on the air thanks for calling hey buddy hey I was calling about two
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:07.720]  issues on one is that my girlfriend she called for an appointment to the doctor
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:14.040]  and they asked her about her religion preference yeah they're not supposed to
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:17.880]  do that under political correctness but instead they do it now for everything
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:23.720]  they done that and she went to the doctor and had her waiting over an hour for
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:29.040]  that and it took her a week to get a prescription that she called for this on
[02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:32.280]  day she did an appointment and my grandmother informed me that I talked
[02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:37.160]  to her back in the 70s they used to do that when she called for her appointment
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:40.960]  and she also been asked that when she called for her last adopt this
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:46.760]  appointment well that's right they're doing all sorts of stuff and then if you
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:50.520]  are a Christian we found they discriminate against you these people are
[02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:54.280]  anti-Christian I mean at the end of the day driving this is an evil agenda and
[02:56:54.280 --> 02:56:58.120]  they want to extinguish real Christianity they want to extinguish the
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:02.920]  family and and and real manhood and motherhood and they've done a really good
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:07.320]  job of it and now they're telling parents they can't make their children
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:10.640]  their own lunch under federal guidelines and I told you that was the case in
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:15.680]  Chicago now it's in Virginia now it's in Colorado and they tell the parents you

[03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:49.520]  played my video someone made of me at the Alaska State Fair with the impede
[03:00:49.520 --> 03:00:54.640]  Obama sign I don't remember it but I'm sure I did it was title it's on YouTube
[03:00:54.640 --> 03:01:00.200]  is titled the root supporter assaulted by Alaska State Fair oh I do I do remember
[03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:05.080]  that now yes so I've been out on the corner here in Palmer Alaska with the
[03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:11.840]  same sign going after Obama I just want to make one point yes it Americans that
[03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:16.600]  are we have an epidemic of cowardice in this country and people are acting like
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:20.720]  Obama's going to be out of there any time well they need to realize that he's
[03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:27.120]  going to be there in there until 2017 if we don't impeach him and also want to
[03:01:27.120 --> 03:01:31.400]  let your listeners especially here in Alaska know that I'm running against
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:41.640]  dirt baggage for Senate next year mark baggage and I just going to see if you
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:48.920]  had any response to that about Obama being in there until 2017 well you know
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:52.600]  he he's a puppet that's kind of lived out as usefulness I think for the
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:57.200]  globalist politically but who knows anything's possible now I mean he's
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:00.360]  public schools under federal commands so you can't pack your kids lunches now
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:03.720]  it's not just it's going nationwide I mean there's almost nothing we won't
[03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:09.120]  bend over for and so who knows I appreciate your call let's talk to Kurt
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:14.720]  you're on the air go ahead hey Alex Kurt here how you doing right brother hey
[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:19.440]  man I was just listening to your show yesterday and yet a caller that was you
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:24.280]  know talking to you about how they planned on pooling this whole thing off
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:28.880]  well I think I might have a possible answer for that guy and for your
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:35.280]  audience basically it dawned on me that they've been running demographs and
[03:02:35.280 --> 03:02:41.240]  questionnaires through our military and I have a sneaking suspicion that our
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:45.920]  ranks are pro-American patriotic people just like us and they're not mindless
[03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:54.440]  zombies so what I think they might do is create a problem overseas IE Syria or
[03:02:54.440 --> 03:02:59.040]  any of those things and they will move all of our troops over there to fight
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:05.240]  this bullshit war oh sorry sorry I accidentally cost but once the troops are
[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:08.840]  overseas and gone then they'll bring in their foreign mercenaries in the mop
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:12.920]  up crew to do all the dirty work what I appreciate your call no I mean that's
[03:03:12.920 --> 03:03:16.560]  always been the plan the troops that say they won't find Americans are loaded
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:20.320]  up with a huge vaccine regimen to be sent to the most hellish place in the
[03:03:20.320 --> 03:03:24.360]  world and those that say I want to you know take guns I hate John Wayne I hate
[03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:29.120]  George Washington on record they end up being your police chief I mean that's what
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:33.200]  that's how they work they're a bunch of traitors and they sit there getting and
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:38.000]  now they think they've amassed enough of these guys to do this but I don't think
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:41.120]  that's the case and it's just we're living in a science fiction movie I
[03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:46.600]  constantly almost pinched myself and like go this really happening I mean I've
[03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:50.200]  really got the Associated Press saying Pentagon may court martial soldiers who
[03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:55.120]  share Christian faith soldiers to be court martial will they give money to
[03:03:55.120 --> 03:03:59.560]  the Tea Party I mean what I mean it's like yeah they're using the IRS on
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:01.800]  people that have done nothing wrong it's incredible thank you for the call
