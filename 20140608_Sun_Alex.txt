[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:22.240]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.240 --> 00:31.040]  make this a year of action that's what most Americans want raising the debt ceiling does not increase our debt nobody is listening to your cell phones the debate is
[00:31.040 --> 00:35.840]  settled climate change is a fact and if people can't trust not only the executive
[00:35.840 --> 00:40.800]  branch but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges then we're
[00:40.800 --> 00:46.000]  gonna have some problems what difference at this point does it make
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.960]  oh my gosh I love this song welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Sunday June 8th
[00:52.960 --> 00:58.240]  2014 I guess everything is awesome or maybe not we're gonna find out there's a
[00:58.240 --> 01:02.400]  lot of breaking news Alex is going to be joining us in the second hour we're
[01:02.400 --> 01:07.280]  going to talk about the overwhelming of the borders is this something that is
[01:07.280 --> 01:12.560]  just incompetence or is it a takedown of America by design we believe the ladder
[01:12.560 --> 01:16.400]  is the case when you look at the soaring unemployment numbers and of course
[01:16.400 --> 01:19.360]  they like to play games with the unemployment figures constantly
[01:19.360 --> 01:23.680]  reviving them every quarter redefining what unemployment means but when you
[01:23.680 --> 01:27.280]  look at the core numbers when you look at how many people are working as a
[01:27.280 --> 01:31.760]  percentage of the population that tells the story accurately and so we're gonna
[01:31.760 --> 01:34.960]  look at what's happening with that and of course there's a lot of news and
[01:34.960 --> 01:40.480]  drudge and elsewhere about the massive dumping of children into the U.S. from
[01:40.480 --> 01:44.320]  Central and South America they're being told go to the United States they will
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.320]  not refuse you I remember when they opened up Hong Kong Disney World and
[01:48.320 --> 01:52.640]  they were so overwhelmed by people trying to get their children into Disney
[01:52.640 --> 01:56.560]  World but parents Chinese parents were going to Disney World even after it was
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.320]  completely full and closed they weren't taking any more tickets they would lift
[02:00.320 --> 02:06.080]  their children over the gates and drop them into Disney World well folks
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.800]  America is no Disney World if you're thinking about doing this for your
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.680]  children's benefit we're going to talk about what is being exposed as far as
[02:15.680 --> 02:19.640]  ongoing information about child trafficking human trafficking the
[02:19.640 --> 02:23.080]  dangers of transporting these children what's going to happen when they come to
[02:23.080 --> 02:25.840]  the United States and they're by themselves without any parents well of
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.680]  course Obama is going to be their parent the United States government is going to
[02:30.680 --> 02:35.080]  be their parent they are going to be raised from a very early age seeing the
[02:35.080 --> 02:41.120]  government as their benefactors having no idea about the foundations of liberty
[02:41.120 --> 02:47.760]  that we have all enjoyed and basically essentially becoming wards of the state
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.680]  and devotees of the state they're going to balkanize America with people who
[02:52.680 --> 02:59.000]  have no connection to an earlier culture have no understanding of individual
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.720]  liberty and how human nature is always working against that trying to
[03:03.720 --> 03:07.800]  consolidate power that was the legacy that our founders gave us when we were in
[03:07.800 --> 03:11.880]  Copenhagen talking to some of the demonstrators there several them said
[03:11.880 --> 03:16.120]  you know we envy you for having the kind of people founding your country like
[03:16.120 --> 03:20.560]  Jefferson and others who wrote about individual liberty who wrote about what
[03:20.560 --> 03:25.240]  is necessary for a government to be controlled so that it doesn't control the
[03:25.240 --> 03:28.280]  people I said well of course they've gotten around that and they said yeah but
[03:28.280 --> 03:33.120]  the fact that you have that foundation that legitimate foundation that's a
[03:33.120 --> 03:37.440]  philosophical foundation it's a legal foundation all the rest of this stuff is
[03:37.440 --> 03:43.120]  built on that foundation is just simply works of straw put on sand when people
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.080]  understand the basis of that foundation that can be swept away so of course the
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.080]  government all government since the time of Plato have wanted to get children at
[03:52.080 --> 03:56.000]  a very early age and raise them away from the family to become the dominant
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.200]  influence in their life I believe that's what's really behind this open door
[04:00.200 --> 04:03.640]  policy on immigration trying to get these anchor children of course we've had
[04:03.640 --> 04:07.360]  anchor babies in the past now they have anchor children but having these children
[04:07.360 --> 04:12.080]  come in and and be wards of the state it's not just something that's going to
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.200]  implode the economy and Alex is going to talk about how it is part of the long
[04:16.200 --> 04:21.040]  term globalist plan they're not going to have jobs neither are we the sector of
[04:21.040 --> 04:26.360]  service the service sector of the economy is going to be replaced by robots
[04:26.360 --> 04:30.400]  they're already doing that first they took the manufacturing base they send it
[04:30.400 --> 04:35.240]  to China next they're taking the manufactured the service base that's
[04:35.240 --> 04:38.000]  left here in the United States that's going to be replaced with robots so what
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.680]  are these people going to do well they're going to use one group against
[04:41.680 --> 04:45.520]  the other as they take us down economically as we can see that they
[04:45.520 --> 04:49.240]  have already taken down Central American companies stay with us we're
[04:49.240 --> 04:53.000]  gonna be right back with news and we'll take your calls also in the second hour
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.040]  get your response to what Alex has to say so stay with us
[04:58.400 --> 05:03.040]  what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday
[05:03.040 --> 05:07.360]  about a potential forthood situation the police are shoving people shoving Alex
[05:07.360 --> 05:12.520]  shoving the crowd whether it's the radio show the news websites
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.760]  documentary films or the nightly news in fall wars is the tip of the spear is
[05:16.760 --> 05:19.960]  this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote
[05:19.960 --> 05:24.280]  security are sticking to hands down on the streets it's up to us to set brush
[05:24.280 --> 05:27.520]  fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what prison
[05:27.520 --> 05:33.280]  planet TV is designed to do you watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or
[05:33.280 --> 05:38.520]  accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels what we see
[05:38.520 --> 05:42.840]  now is a war against reality it's a war against the truth it's more vital than
[05:42.840 --> 05:47.640]  ever that supporters of freedom become members of prison planet TV and share
[05:47.640 --> 05:52.520]  their membership with up to 11 friends and family visit info wars news.com
[05:52.520 --> 05:56.760]  today become a member share your membership and help take the info war to
[05:56.760 --> 05:59.360]  the next level
[06:07.640 --> 06:15.560]  you want answers well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex
[06:15.560 --> 06:18.040]  Jones
[06:39.040 --> 06:44.320]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Sunday June 8th 2014 I'm
[06:44.320 --> 06:49.480]  gonna be joined by Alex and a special report about what's really going on with
[06:49.480 --> 06:53.120]  this overwhelming immigration of course there's a lot of information in the news
[06:53.120 --> 06:56.360]  about people just bringing their children to the United States they say
[06:56.360 --> 06:59.880]  take them to the United States they will not be refused they think that their
[06:59.880 --> 07:03.280]  children are going to be educated here they think they're going to be safe here
[07:03.280 --> 07:06.920]  they need to think again as I just mentioned in the first segment seen
[07:06.920 --> 07:11.440]  this before in Hong Kong where when Disneyland opened up in Hong Kong people
[07:11.440 --> 07:14.560]  just took their children to Disneyland if they couldn't get in they just drop
[07:14.560 --> 07:19.400]  them over the gate that's not going to work in the United States we've got
[07:19.400 --> 07:24.640]  information about child pedophile rings it's breaking in Virginia as well as the
[07:24.640 --> 07:29.800]  overall plan of the globalist and how they're going to not only replace
[07:29.800 --> 07:34.280]  American workers but they're going to replace any service workers with robots
[07:34.280 --> 07:37.800]  this is something that they've planned for a long time Alex is going to break
[07:37.800 --> 07:42.600]  that down for us but first I want to go into the story that just broke this last
[07:42.600 --> 07:47.800]  Friday after our show Paul Joseph Watson had a report the economists an
[07:47.800 --> 07:52.040]  economist says that US banks are preparing to charge customers for
[07:52.040 --> 07:56.600]  deposits now this was earlier in the week we told you that the European Central
[07:56.600 --> 08:00.080]  Bank was going to start doing negative interest rates for the banks there of
[08:00.080 --> 08:05.280]  course in other words charging them for money that they had on deposit and now
[08:05.280 --> 08:07.720]  of course if they're going to do that to the banks you know that the banks are
[08:07.720 --> 08:12.520]  going to push that along plus add additional fees to that for their own
[08:12.520 --> 08:16.960]  customers it's just a matter of time but Paul in the article quoted a couple of
[08:16.960 --> 08:19.760]  economists here in the United States that point out that of course it's
[08:19.760 --> 08:23.000]  inevitable that's going to come to the United States as well question is when
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.320]  and in what form and the article he says banks in the EU have not indicated
[08:27.320 --> 08:30.840]  whether or not the costs will be passed on to consumers but the New York Times
[08:30.840 --> 08:34.680]  as Neil Irwin says it's inevitable he says they're going to pass on these
[08:34.680 --> 08:39.440]  negative interest rates to consumers or at least try to they may do so probably
[08:39.440 --> 08:41.840]  not by explicitly charging them interest rates in other words they're not
[08:41.840 --> 08:44.640]  going to put an item they're not going to say that they're going to give you a
[08:44.640 --> 08:47.480]  negative interest rate that would just annoy people of course they're going to
[08:47.480 --> 08:50.880]  be much more subtle about it they're going to add new fees or they're going
[08:50.880 --> 08:54.080]  to increase the amount of account maintenance fees that's always been the
[08:54.080 --> 08:58.360]  case in the past just look at how your bank fees have escalated we ought to do
[08:58.360 --> 09:02.560]  an article about that we ought to go in and look at the escalating charges for
[09:02.560 --> 09:06.920]  every service that the banks provide but then he also quotes another economist
[09:06.920 --> 09:11.800]  Martin Armstrong he points out the article that Armstrong called the 1987
[09:11.800 --> 09:16.000]  economic crash to the very day and he says the banks are preparing for a raft
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.600]  of new account fees he said in the US we're more than likely not more likely
[09:20.600 --> 09:23.880]  than not we're going to get negative interest rates directly passed on to
[09:23.880 --> 09:27.800]  consumers by the banks who will now claim that it's the feds that are making
[09:27.800 --> 09:30.720]  them do it because the feds will raise it on the banks and then they'll say we've
[09:30.720 --> 09:34.240]  got to pass those rates along to you so you want to get your money out you want
[09:34.240 --> 09:38.080]  to get your money out of the bank and put it in a mattress well guess again
[09:38.080 --> 09:42.240]  because we got another article up secret European cash limits are in place
[09:42.240 --> 09:46.320]  again starting in Europe they love to start these things in Europe that's
[09:46.320 --> 09:49.400]  where the consolidation with the European Union started that's where they
[09:49.400 --> 09:54.200]  started the euro they used the collapse of the euro to take out elected
[09:54.200 --> 09:58.600]  representatives in places like Italy and Greece and replace them with Goldman
[09:58.600 --> 10:02.840]  Sachs bankers where they call them technocrats and so now we see that they're
[10:02.840 --> 10:06.600]  going the next step as he points out some of you remember the recent scandal
[10:06.600 --> 10:11.440]  where HSBC tried to impose cash withdrawal limits on their accounts and
[10:11.440 --> 10:17.600]  this person Mark Kimpton from the BBC says it turns out that was just a trial
[10:17.600 --> 10:22.400]  balloon to see if the public would object to it these limits are already in
[10:22.400 --> 10:25.800]  place and they're going to limit your cash withdrawals they're going to say
[10:25.800 --> 10:28.640]  you can't take your money out you got to keep it in there and we're going to
[10:28.640 --> 10:31.920]  course charge you higher fees on that that's the way this thing is going to
[10:31.920 --> 10:37.400]  go down this has been something that and again we're going to go to the
[10:37.400 --> 10:43.000]  immigration system but before I do that I also want to point out that this last
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.320]  week of course was the one-year anniversary of the Snowden leaks we
[10:47.320 --> 10:52.120]  have an article up on info war today from Washington's blog an NSA whistle
[10:52.120 --> 10:57.240]  blower says it Snowden never had access to the juiciest documents now this isn't
[10:57.240 --> 11:02.800]  just any NSA whistleblower this was the first of the NSA whistleblowers we've
[11:02.800 --> 11:06.520]  talked to William Benny here at info wars and of course he was the technical
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.320]  head with global responsibilities a global technical head of the NSA we
[11:10.320 --> 11:13.960]  talked to him about their capabilities he's very concerned for a while he was
[11:13.960 --> 11:17.760]  saying we're this close to a police state holding his two fingers very close
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.880]  like a pinch but now a few months ago he said we are in a police state he said
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.400]  for years and he worked for the NSA for over 30 years he said he'd monitored
[11:27.400 --> 11:32.000]  during his career East Germany as well as Russia he knows what a police state
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.680]  looks like he knows when they're monitoring their own system their own
[11:35.680 --> 11:39.960]  citizens to the extent that they are in this system what that brings about and
[11:39.960 --> 11:44.760]  he said that's what we're doing here we've had several NSA whistleblowers
[11:44.760 --> 11:49.920]  prior to Snowden they were very very concerned when they saw the surveillance
[11:49.920 --> 11:54.240]  turn inward now in this article that's up on info wars what Tyson was saying was
[11:54.240 --> 11:57.920]  one of the very first things that people would be told when they started to work
[11:57.920 --> 12:04.680]  for the NSA was the number one rule is that because of FISA you do not ever
[12:04.680 --> 12:08.760]  spy on American citizens that's the foreign intelligence surveillance act
[12:08.760 --> 12:13.840]  you had to get special court permissions from a secretive court the FISA court
[12:13.840 --> 12:18.080]  that of course was created in response to the revelations that came out of the
[12:18.080 --> 12:23.120]  Frank Church Committee hearings in the 1970s talking about CIA abuses people
[12:23.120 --> 12:28.360]  were very concerned about the CIA and other intelligence organizations turning
[12:28.360 --> 12:33.000]  on the American people and creating a police state domestically these
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.360]  organizations that were created to protect us from foreign enemies remember
[12:37.360 --> 12:45.000]  what Madison said he said if tyranny ever comes to America it will come tyranny
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.760]  and oppression it will come in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy that is what
[12:49.760 --> 12:53.680]  the NSA is doing we've talked about that in conjunction with the asymmetric
[12:53.680 --> 12:58.120]  warfare groups and their training from takeover American cities we've talked
[12:58.120 --> 13:03.280]  about the militarization of the police and using the military as police well
[13:03.280 --> 13:09.720]  that is especially true of these NSA type documents that is where we're going
[13:09.720 --> 13:17.040]  now this is an article where Tice is talking about what Snowden did not have
[13:17.040 --> 13:23.680]  access to and he quite frankly says that he believes that the NSA is spying on
[13:23.680 --> 13:29.160]  and blackmailing top government officials and military officers including
[13:29.160 --> 13:33.440]  Supreme Court justices highly ranked generals Colin Powell other State
[13:33.440 --> 13:37.040]  Department personnel and many other top officials and of course we've said I've
[13:37.040 --> 13:41.520]  said many times I firmly believe that when you look at the bizarre decision
[13:41.520 --> 13:46.360]  that Justice Roberts came out with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
[13:46.360 --> 13:51.640]  writing both the dissenting and agreeing opinion enabling Obamacare that
[13:51.640 --> 13:57.160]  dramatic 180 degree turnaround and writing both sides the opinion first
[13:57.160 --> 14:01.360]  disagreeing with it and then all of a sudden agreeing with it I believe and
[14:01.360 --> 14:04.920]  many other people have also believed that he was blackmailed this is a fellow
[14:04.920 --> 14:10.720]  Robert Tice was the very first of the NSA whistleblowers he was even before
[14:10.720 --> 14:15.760]  William Benny and Thomas Drake and others who came after him and when he came
[14:15.760 --> 14:21.000]  out he was part of a group and he was not a technical head as William Benny
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.600]  was in terms of looking at the programs but what he was concerned about was
[14:26.600 --> 14:31.280]  still domestic espionage he was concerned about the fact that there was a
[14:31.280 --> 14:38.120]  separate higher group within the NSA that had access to documents that the
[14:38.120 --> 14:42.040]  rest of the NSA did not have and he says in this article it is very
[14:42.040 --> 14:46.080]  compartmentalized even with the stuff they had you might have something at the
[14:46.080 --> 14:50.400]  NSA where there's literally only 40 people that know that it's going on in
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.320]  the entire agency he's saying that when they're doing these criminal actions it's
[14:55.320 --> 14:58.840]  very similar to the types of things that J. Edgar Hoover was pulling on
[14:58.840 --> 15:03.520]  officials that we now know for many many decades controlling them blackmailing
[15:03.520 --> 15:09.840]  them Hoover had nothing like the NSA's capabilities it would be very frightening
[15:09.840 --> 15:13.680]  to think what he would have done and yet human nature is human nature there's
[15:13.680 --> 15:18.240]  nothing that unique about J. Edgar Hoover to think that there aren't many
[15:18.240 --> 15:22.520]  J. Edgar Hoover's within the NSA whenever you give the government that kind of
[15:22.520 --> 15:27.880]  capability they will use it and he points that out here in his article he
[15:27.880 --> 15:31.760]  says the information that they got about the fact that they even at the time of
[15:31.760 --> 15:35.560]  the church hearings the NSA was wiretapping Frank Church and other

[20:25.840 --> 20:29.640]  joining us in the second hour we're going to be talking about the massive
[20:29.640 --> 20:33.840]  immigration that's being allowed actually encouraged by our government what
[20:33.840 --> 20:38.080]  does it mean for our society is it part of a larger plan Alex is going to break
[20:38.080 --> 20:41.560]  that down for you in the second hour in the last segment we were talking about
[20:41.560 --> 20:46.040]  a new revelation from an NSA whistleblower actually he's been talking
[20:46.040 --> 20:50.280]  about various aspects of this for quite some time Russell Tice someone who was
[20:50.280 --> 20:53.920]  actually one of the first of the NSA whistleblowers many people don't
[20:53.920 --> 20:59.560]  realize that before Ed Snowden there were I believe there was five maybe six
[20:59.560 --> 21:04.120]  NSA whistleblowers there were four that were together Tice was the very first one
[21:04.120 --> 21:08.800]  they were talking about the fact that the American government was for the first
[21:08.800 --> 21:16.280]  time after 9-11 spying on Americans and drag net methods people that were not
[21:16.280 --> 21:22.600]  suspected of any crime and not going before a FISA judge as they were
[21:22.600 --> 21:28.720]  required to do and of course FISA was something that was a provision that came
[21:28.720 --> 21:32.960]  after the church committee hearings to try to rein in the intelligence community
[21:32.960 --> 21:37.960]  to keep them from doing this very thing and yet the FISA quote-unquote court has
[21:37.960 --> 21:43.640]  become this secretive court with one judge one lawyer from the administration
[21:43.640 --> 21:48.160]  who wants that judge to do something nobody in an adversarial relationship
[21:48.160 --> 21:52.680]  nobody no judge on the other side saying that's not a good idea nobody
[21:52.680 --> 21:56.400]  advocating for the Bill of Rights or the Constitution or the American people
[21:56.400 --> 22:02.000]  there is no adversarial hearing it is a closed-door star chamber type of
[22:02.000 --> 22:08.000]  hearing and when they create these they say precedent-setting decisions they
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.680]  pretend as if they are modifying the Constitution and doing so with a court
[22:13.680 --> 22:18.960]  decision that the American public is never allowed to see so it's an amazing
[22:18.960 --> 22:26.280]  world but I tell you what Stephen Fry had a video that was up on the Guardian and
[22:26.280 --> 22:30.800]  I don't know if you guys can get a little bit of this cute up here but he said
[22:30.800 --> 22:36.800]  there is something squalid and rancid about being spied on he did that as part
[22:36.800 --> 22:39.960]  of the one-year anniversary of the Snowden documents coming out but as
[22:39.960 --> 22:44.520]  Russell Tice was pointing out Snowden never had access to the juiciest
[22:44.520 --> 22:49.040]  documents in other words there were things that they didn't put on PowerPoint
[22:49.040 --> 22:53.360]  displays and there's some pretty bad stuff that we've seen on PowerPoint
[22:53.360 --> 22:57.840]  displays but some of the worst stuff some of the stuff that is similar to what we
[22:57.840 --> 23:02.440]  know Jagger Hoover was doing in terms of blackmailing senators blackmailing
[23:02.440 --> 23:07.400]  Supreme Court justices destroying military personnel or generals as we've
[23:07.400 --> 23:11.760]  seen with Petraeus and I don't know what was going on with Petraeus of course he
[23:11.760 --> 23:18.200]  is now subsequently allied himself with Hillary Clinton and perhaps it had
[23:18.200 --> 23:22.120]  something to do with the Benghazi affair is why they took him out nevertheless
[23:22.120 --> 23:26.640]  the fact that they're able to do this should concern all of us it should
[23:26.640 --> 23:29.840]  concern all of us that they're looking at our own stuff and that's what Stephen
[23:29.840 --> 23:33.160]  Frye was talking about he said there's something squalid and rancid about
[23:33.160 --> 23:37.000]  being spied on can you play that something squalid and rancid about
[23:37.000 --> 23:41.720]  being spied on nobody likes it the idea of having your letters read by
[23:41.720 --> 23:49.220]  somebody your telegrams your faxes your postcards intercepted was always
[23:49.220 --> 23:52.800]  considered one of the meanest most beastly things a human being could do
[23:52.800 --> 24:00.320]  and for government to do without good cause using the fear of terrorism that
[24:00.320 --> 24:06.760]  we all have the fear of the unknown that we all share fear of enemies who hate
[24:06.760 --> 24:17.760]  us is a duplicitous and a deeply wrong means of excusing something as base as
[24:17.760 --> 24:26.000]  spying on the citizens of your own country gchq the NSA in America
[24:26.000 --> 24:32.440]  cooperate together through prism and other systems to listen in on to read
[24:32.440 --> 24:37.200]  and intercept everything we send yes it's enough that corporations it is
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.520]  amazing it truly is amazing and appreciate him speaking out on that of
[24:41.520 --> 24:45.520]  course that's Stephen Frye he's a writer he's a comedian he was one of the
[24:45.520 --> 24:50.440]  actors and V for vendetta if you recognize his voice so he has it
[24:50.440 --> 24:57.600]  exactly and it really is not only or well in but it's kind of an Alice in
[24:57.600 --> 25:02.000]  Wonderland type of so many different aspects to it look at this article judge
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.840]  orders the NSA to stop destroying evidence for the third time say when you
[25:07.840 --> 25:11.160]  give them that kind of power they're not going to listen to anybody if they're
[25:11.160 --> 25:14.160]  going to violate the Constitution don't you think they'll violate a judge's
[25:14.160 --> 25:19.040]  order now this is a judge that has asked the national security agency to stop
[25:19.040 --> 25:23.240]  destroying surveillance records that could be used to challenge the legality
[25:23.240 --> 25:27.840]  of its spying programs in court now this is a lawsuit that's being brought by the
[25:27.840 --> 25:33.520]  electronic frontier Foundation EFF so they're asking the NSA don't destroy
[25:33.520 --> 25:37.920]  these records we are going to be using them as part of a trial so the NSA
[25:37.920 --> 25:44.000]  comes back with this kind of Kafka s reply and they say well we can't do that
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.800]  because if we if we didn't hold these records we could have a loss of access
[25:49.800 --> 25:54.440]  to lawfully collected signals intelligence information okay I think
[25:54.440 --> 25:59.840]  about that they're saying we we can't retain these records because we don't
[25:59.840 --> 26:03.760]  want to lose information that's essentially what they're saying so the
[26:03.760 --> 26:07.960]  EFF said in a statement late Thursday says how can the preservation of
[26:07.960 --> 26:12.880]  intercepted communications cause a quote loss of access to lawfully collected
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.600]  signals intelligence information that information will remain accessible even
[26:17.600 --> 26:23.160]  though it is being preserved right so we can't preserve it because we could we
[26:23.160 --> 26:28.120]  could lose it if we preserve it not true as a matter of fact and the crazy war on
[26:28.120 --> 26:34.680]  drugs here in Texas and of course this is where much of the destruction of our
[26:34.680 --> 26:39.760]  Constitution into a police state into a surveillance state began decades ago we
[26:39.760 --> 26:44.520]  have an article here from the from Forbes dot com cops in Texas sees
[26:44.520 --> 26:49.240]  millions by policing for profit and they point out that in a recent decision a
[26:49.240 --> 26:55.000]  Texas Supreme Court justice compared the act of civil forfeiture to Allison
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.400]  Wonderland and Kafka because what's happening in civil forfeiture is that
[26:59.400 --> 27:04.040]  they're charging inanimate objects with crimes even though the owners are never
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.960]  charged with anything they essentially charge the inanimate objects and of
[27:07.960 --> 27:11.960]  course the inanimate objects have no civil liberties because of course they're
[27:11.960 --> 27:16.920]  not people but you have these cases of the U.S. versus Learjet or the U.S.
[27:16.920 --> 27:23.880]  versus 1999 Camaro or whatever it is that they're coming after and they point out
[27:23.880 --> 27:29.320]  that in just one county Tarrant County Texas the district attorney's office
[27:29.320 --> 27:35.680]  seized three and a half million dollars plus 250 cars 440 computers and just
[27:35.680 --> 27:40.520]  fiscal year 2013 that's about 10 percent of their budget they got by
[27:40.520 --> 27:46.540]  stealing property without charging even a person with a crime in other words they
[27:46.540 --> 27:50.480]  didn't find anybody guilty of a crime they didn't even charge anyone with a
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.600]  crime but they confiscated the property and charged the property with a crime
[27:54.600 --> 27:59.360]  and we've seen this going on since the early 90s now even Forbes is taking
[27:59.360 --> 28:03.240]  notice of this it used to be something that only obscure libertarian journals
[28:03.240 --> 28:06.200]  talked about so at least we're making some headway when we've got mainstream
[28:06.200 --> 28:10.640]  articles talking about it but they also point out that most of this went to
[28:10.640 --> 28:17.120]  salaries they had six hundred sixty thousand dollars in cash used and four
[28:17.120 --> 28:21.800]  hundred twenty six thousand dollars in cash to play to pay salaries and of
[28:21.800 --> 28:26.920]  course they only gave fifty three thousand dollars to six nonprofits that
[28:26.920 --> 28:31.560]  would benefit victims or prosecution efforts so most of this money is going
[28:31.560 --> 28:38.400]  to the police department and in Tampa we had a case where some cops went in and
[28:38.400 --> 28:43.620]  totally trashed a guy's truck when he wasn't even there because they asserted
[28:43.620 --> 28:48.040]  that they smelled marijuana or canine smelled it so he comes back to his truck
[28:48.040 --> 28:52.360]  he finds it absolutely totally broken into and trashed with a note from a cop
[28:52.360 --> 28:57.520]  saying we thought we smell something funny so we went after your truck and now
[28:57.520 --> 29:00.680]  they're saying that's nothing unusual we will be right back
[29:00.680 --> 29:04.240]  it's John for info wars dot com I know that most of you here in this commercial

[33:45.200 --> 33:49.960]  uncontrolled amounts coming across the border how that endangers them and what

[34:12.120 --> 34:16.120]  high purity grade of iodine from more than 7,000 feet below the earth's
[34:16.120 --> 34:21.000]  surface far below the Fukushima wave of radiation now it's extracted from an
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.480]  ancient salt solution that yields a powerful and uncontaminated 650
[34:24.480 --> 34:29.200]  micrograms of iodine per single drop tested with radiation readings at the
[34:29.200 --> 34:33.320]  labs to ensure freedom from Fukushima radiation it's developed proprietary
[34:33.320 --> 34:39.280]  technology to create nascent iodine and it continues to pioneer our products

[34:55.000 --> 34:59.040]  your family and support our operation here now just before the break we were
[34:59.040 --> 35:04.800]  talking about this case in Florida where this man comes back to his truck and he
[35:04.800 --> 35:08.680]  finds it's totally been vandalized and all he finds is this little handwritten
[35:08.680 --> 35:12.200]  note from the police saying that they thought they smell something funny he
[35:12.200 --> 35:15.640]  says I come from outside I jump in the truck and the whole thing's been torn
[35:15.640 --> 35:20.560]  apart inside wires have been yanked out the paneling had some scratches on it
[35:20.560 --> 35:24.400]  one could think that it was a burglar who had been inside his truck writes the
[35:24.400 --> 35:28.840]  yahoo article here but he says it was a police and heller did not know it was
[35:28.840 --> 35:32.200]  because knew that because they left a note saying what they did they said
[35:32.200 --> 35:37.360]  that a canine officer thought that he smelled something so that gave them
[35:37.360 --> 35:43.560]  reason to trash his truck he says it's used for his business this is whole life
[35:43.560 --> 35:48.680]  savings this is marketing tool as well as his transportation he promotes his
[35:48.680 --> 35:52.840]  product which is air horns he said nothing was working all of the
[35:52.840 --> 35:56.040]  electronics were ripped out and of course they didn't charge him with
[35:56.040 --> 36:00.040]  anything because they didn't find any marijuana they just did it on suspicion
[36:00.040 --> 36:03.920]  now when they complained about it the Tampa Police Department said well the
[36:03.920 --> 36:09.280]  search is legal but it's not typical no it's not legal it's not legal the fourth
[36:09.280 --> 36:12.960]  amendment says that if you want to search somebody's person place property
[36:12.960 --> 36:19.120]  you get a order from the judge to do so you go before a judge before you break
[36:19.120 --> 36:24.360]  and enter whether that's a car or a house what if they started doing that to
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.200]  houses I'm sure they they will we get no-knock raids from SWAT teams people
[36:28.200 --> 36:32.240]  get killed regularly because of those no-knock no-knock raids we need to get
[36:32.240 --> 36:36.600]  upset about this because you know what it's not just this fellows truck it's
[36:36.600 --> 36:41.520]  our rights our rights are property as well it's not just that his truck was
[36:41.520 --> 36:46.520]  trashed and destroyed we have rights those fundamental rights those God
[36:46.520 --> 36:52.680]  given rights that are specifically recognized and restrictions are put on
[36:52.680 --> 36:56.000]  the government to keep them from destroying these rights that we possess
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.360]  as human beings and yet our government routinely is destroying and trashing
[37:00.360 --> 37:05.720]  those rights just like they broke in and destroyed this guy's truck now of
[37:05.720 --> 37:12.040]  course this is on Yahoo and it was in the odd news section I wish it was odd
[37:12.040 --> 37:17.080]  news I wish it was something that was really unusual no it's not unusual it's
[37:17.080 --> 37:22.440]  just illegal it's just the opposite of what the Tampa Police Department said
[37:22.440 --> 37:27.200]  now as I mentioned Alex is going to be joining us at the top of the hour he's
[37:27.200 --> 37:32.000]  going to talk about what's what's going on with the larger picture of what we
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.160]  see happening but there were a couple of articles that came out on drudges last
[37:35.160 --> 37:41.040]  week that I think put together they really show a pattern of behavior that
[37:41.040 --> 37:44.200]  we've been talking about for a long time that the Bilderberg group and others
[37:44.200 --> 37:50.600]  have been talking about for a long time the first one here 37.2% are not in the
[37:50.600 --> 37:57.280]  labor force it remains at a 36 year high this is 92 million people that are not
[37:57.280 --> 38:00.200]  working right now now of course they'd like to play games with these
[38:00.200 --> 38:03.320]  unemployment figures they say that if you're without a job for a certain
[38:03.320 --> 38:06.960]  period of time you've just dropped out the labor force and we're not going to
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.880]  include you anymore in that and yet that's and then of course they're also
[38:10.880 --> 38:16.000]  constantly every quarter revising the unemployment figures always doing so in
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.200]  a way to make it look as thing as if things are trending up this is a story
[38:20.200 --> 38:26.200]  from cnsnews.com and they point out that this is the lowest labor force
[38:26.200 --> 38:30.880]  participate participation that we have right now in 36 years at no time during
[38:30.880 --> 38:36.320]  the presidency's of Ronald Reagan George H. W. Bush Bill Clinton or George W. Bush
[38:36.320 --> 38:40.640]  did such a small percentage of the civilian non-institutional population
[38:40.640 --> 38:46.800]  hold a job or seek one they say that when Obama took office in 2009 that number
[38:46.800 --> 38:51.040]  was at sixty five point seven percent at the beginning of his second term it had
[38:51.040 --> 38:56.080]  dropped from sixty five point seven to sixty three point six and now it is at
[38:56.080 --> 39:02.720]  sixty two point eight percent so why is it that we don't have employment why is
[39:02.720 --> 39:07.200]  it dropping well there's a lot of reasons one of them is of course Obamacare
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.640]  Obamacare is making all businesses especially the smaller businesses where
[39:12.640 --> 39:16.980]  most of the job growth comes from they're making them very much afraid to
[39:16.980 --> 39:21.120]  hire people because of the added costs that are going to come with each employee
[39:21.120 --> 39:27.160]  they have reduced the number of hours to define what a full-time employee is
[39:27.160 --> 39:31.800]  raise the cost of insurance for people and if you don't want to so of course
[39:31.800 --> 39:36.120]  they're not hiring people and not giving them as many hours taking them down so
[39:36.120 --> 39:40.600]  that they are part-time employees and if you as an individual want to opt out of
[39:40.600 --> 39:44.880]  this because you don't want to pay more to the insurance companies to get less
[39:44.880 --> 39:48.400]  coverage and that's what's happening because it was the insurance companies
[39:48.400 --> 39:53.520]  that wrote this this is not being done for the benefit of the individuals out
[39:53.520 --> 39:56.760]  there this is something's being done for the benefit of these large insurance
[39:56.760 --> 40:00.640]  companies that donated so much money to the politicians but if you want to opt
[40:00.640 --> 40:06.400]  out of that there's an article on roll call back on June 6th that said that
[40:06.400 --> 40:11.080]  there's going to be there estimating that it's going to be an additional four
[40:11.080 --> 40:14.680]  billion dollars in revenue for the government just from taxing people who
[40:14.680 --> 40:19.960]  opt out of the system now the headline that was on the roll call article I
[40:19.960 --> 40:23.320]  think was pretty amazing because they called it the shrinking Obamacare
[40:23.320 --> 40:28.880]  individual mandate there's nothing shrinking about that what shrunk was
[40:28.880 --> 40:32.320]  there's nothing shrinking about his mandates and why should we be having
[40:32.320 --> 40:36.840]  presidential mandates about how we how what kind of health insurance we have
[40:36.840 --> 40:39.240]  of course we've said this over and over again but here's the thing the
[40:39.240 --> 40:43.960]  congressional budget office went through and said well we think that it's going
[40:43.960 --> 40:48.640]  to be not six million people who would rather pay a tax than to pay these
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.560]  confiscatory insurance premiums that are being mandated on them by the
[40:53.560 --> 40:58.440]  insurance companies and their puppets in the government you know forcing young
[40:58.440 --> 41:03.240]  single males to buy maternity insurance that type of thing insurance that you
[41:03.240 --> 41:08.680]  don't need insurance that you can't use and then paying more for your deductibles
[41:08.680 --> 41:12.360]  paying several times what you were before in premiums they think that the
[41:12.360 --> 41:15.600]  number of people that are going to opt out of that is dropping from six million
[41:15.600 --> 41:18.560]  to four million so the headline they put in here is the shrinking Obamacare
[41:18.560 --> 41:21.640]  individual mandate there's nothing about the mandate that shrinking it's just
[41:21.640 --> 41:24.960]  their particular estimate but now they're still estimating that's going to be
[41:24.960 --> 41:28.280]  four billion dollars in revenue so if they're estimating that four million
[41:28.280 --> 41:32.400]  people are going to opt out and they're going to get an additional four billion
[41:32.400 --> 41:36.120]  dollars in revenue that's about a thousand dollars per person on average
[41:36.120 --> 41:42.300]  now of course Obama said he wasn't going to raise taxes on anybody that was
[41:42.300 --> 41:46.960]  making less than 250,000 a year and he said you're not gonna see any form of
[41:46.960 --> 41:52.080]  tax increase not your income tax not your payroll tax not your capital gains
[41:52.080 --> 41:57.080]  tax not any of your taxes and he said that multiple times as we pointed out so
[41:57.080 --> 42:02.320]  there's a lot about just the Obamacare mandates that are going to take down our
[42:02.320 --> 42:07.600]  economy but this is where it really really comes in and that is on the
[42:07.600 --> 42:12.840]  immigration front now on the immigration front we see news articles this last
[42:12.840 --> 42:17.120]  week about all these children that are being encouraged to come to North
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.600]  America they're being told in Central America go to America with your child
[42:22.600 --> 42:27.160]  you won't be turned away that's what the mothers are telling the reporters and
[42:27.160 --> 42:32.640]  of course they're coming into Texas they're coming into Arizona Arizona
[42:32.640 --> 42:36.360]  actually is getting the overflow of Texas most of them are coming into Texas
[42:36.360 --> 42:40.440]  and the Arizona governor Jim Brewer said she was disturbed on Friday and
[42:40.440 --> 42:44.160]  outraged after she was told by the federal government that they're going to
[42:44.160 --> 42:48.640]  be in her words dumping immigrants on them a thousand children right away
[42:48.640 --> 42:51.320]  we're gonna be back we're gonna have more information on this and we're gonna
[42:51.320 --> 42:55.920]  break down what it's going to do to break down our country you can't have a
[42:55.920 --> 43:00.200]  welfare state and open borders at the same time we'll be right back in the
[43:00.200 --> 43:05.440]  last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[43:05.440 --> 43:10.920]  the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess
[43:10.920 --> 43:14.880]  what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones
[43:14.880 --> 43:20.120]  here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt
[43:20.120 --> 43:25.320]  producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[43:25.320 --> 43:31.360]  results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that
[43:31.360 --> 43:35.600]  had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important

[47:35.920 --> 47:40.960]  began to talk about and that is the dumping of illegal aliens in the United
[47:40.960 --> 47:44.760]  States by the Obama administration that's essentially what's happening now
[47:44.760 --> 47:50.040]  there was an article on Fox News about Governor Jan Brewer governor of Arizona's
[47:50.040 --> 47:55.200]  reaction to the fact that so many illegal children illegal alien children
[47:55.200 --> 48:00.920]  are being brought to her state just this weekend a thousand are expected to be
[48:00.920 --> 48:04.400]  brought from Texas to her state but why are they coming in well they're coming
[48:04.400 --> 48:08.400]  in because they're being told in Central and South America take your children to
[48:08.400 --> 48:11.600]  United States they won't refuse you so these parents are bringing their
[48:11.600 --> 48:17.000]  children in and essentially abandoning many of them a very dangerous situation
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.040]  for them and before people say that we're racist or xenophobic I want to
[48:22.040 --> 48:25.400]  point out that this is something they've been doing to the third world for a
[48:25.400 --> 48:31.600]  very long time this is something that the World Bank and the IMF fund the
[48:31.600 --> 48:35.640]  World Bank under Robert McNamara basically was imploding the economies of
[48:35.640 --> 48:40.400]  Central and South America much of the third world is under his oversight of
[48:40.400 --> 48:44.560]  the World Bank what they did was they shifted from loaning money to companies
[48:44.560 --> 48:48.840]  right after countries right after World War two to build their infrastructure
[48:48.840 --> 48:52.040]  they switched to a situation where they were encouraging encouraging them to
[48:52.040 --> 48:57.040]  create a welfare state essentially consumerism money that they couldn't
[48:57.040 --> 48:59.600]  pay back if they were going to build up an infrastructure if they were going to
[48:59.600 --> 49:04.480]  build roads and factories presumably that could build up their economy and
[49:04.480 --> 49:09.400]  they might be able to pay back those debts but the IMF was accused of rent
[49:09.400 --> 49:13.560]  seeking in other words trying to make these people debtors to them they were
[49:13.560 --> 49:18.160]  increasing their indebtedness by up to 20% each year in the third world
[49:18.160 --> 49:22.360]  countries so how did that look what we've talked about on Friday what was
[49:22.360 --> 49:25.960]  going on in Venezuela for example the socialist people's paradise and of
[49:25.960 --> 49:30.680]  course if you want to bankrupt a country using a welfare system no better
[49:30.680 --> 49:36.960]  way to do it than with a socialist like Chavez now Hugo Chavez Bloomberg likes
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.000]  to point out kept up payments to bondholders allowing them to reap
[49:41.000 --> 49:48.160]  returns of 692 percent during his 14-year tenure you get that this is
[49:48.160 --> 49:54.440]  Bloomberg.com bragging about the fact that this communist Hugo Chavez who you
[49:54.440 --> 49:58.920]  would think might be somebody that these capitalists wouldn't like they love him
[49:58.920 --> 50:05.680]  why because he works with him because they got 700% profits 700% profits now
[50:05.680 --> 50:11.040]  it's not much better after he left his successor now is in debt to these banks
[50:11.040 --> 50:15.280]  and what's happening well his people are going without drinking water drinking
[50:15.280 --> 50:19.560]  water and medicine they're having to go to other countries in order to get water
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.840]  in order to get medicine why because as they point out this is a quote from
[50:24.840 --> 50:30.120]  Barclays the government's priority is to pay their sovereign debt in other words
[50:30.120 --> 50:38.080]  this socialist government is going to pay off the bankers loans before their
[50:38.080 --> 50:43.440]  people get water or medicine that's the way that it works you think that
[50:43.440 --> 50:48.000]  socialism is the opposite of this kind of crony capitalism this kind of
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.640]  fascist capitalism that we're seeing here in America no it's the way that they
[50:52.640 --> 50:56.800]  roll that out and we see that happening in Venezuela we see it happening
[50:56.800 --> 51:00.480]  throughout Central America so these poor people who are now coming to America
[51:00.480 --> 51:04.920]  because the bankers have imploded their country they're now coming in and
[51:04.920 --> 51:08.000]  thinking that they're going to be able to get a free ride here well you know
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.920]  what as you can have just like they say you know good fast and cheap pick any
[51:12.920 --> 51:16.160]  two well sometimes you can't even get two of those sometimes you can't even
[51:16.160 --> 51:22.440]  get one of those you cannot have a welfare state and open borders you can't
[51:22.440 --> 51:27.840]  have it even if you think that you can run a welfare state as Margaret Thatcher
[51:27.840 --> 51:31.880]  pointed out eventually you run out of other people's money or eventually what
[51:31.880 --> 51:36.560]  happens is the bankers loan you the money and bankrupt your country as they
[51:36.560 --> 51:41.440]  make 700% return on their investment as they did in Venezuela working with the
[51:41.440 --> 51:46.640]  the guy who's defending the people the guy who was on the people's side against
[51:46.640 --> 51:51.680]  the big corporations yeah right right and those big corporations 700% return
[51:51.680 --> 51:55.960]  on their investment so you can't have though you can't have a welfare state
[51:55.960 --> 52:01.600]  and open borders at best you could pick one but you can't have both this is a
[52:01.600 --> 52:06.600]  deliberate policy to destroy the United States and people understand that many
[52:06.600 --> 52:11.480]  people understand it governor Brewer understands it from Arizona as I said
[52:11.480 --> 52:14.600]  before a thousand illegal immigrant children will be dumped in Arizona of
[52:14.600 --> 52:18.600]  course they're coming from Texas they shouldn't be here in Texas she said
[52:18.600 --> 52:22.360]  this is a crisis of the federal government's creation and the fact that
[52:22.360 --> 52:27.440]  the border remains unsecure now apparently intentionally intentionally while
[52:27.440 --> 52:31.200]  this operation continues full steam ahead is deplorable she said she was
[52:31.200 --> 52:34.880]  informed by federal officials that not only has the government been shipping
[52:34.880 --> 52:40.040]  these illegal immigrants out of Texas and into Arizona but it has no plans to
[52:40.040 --> 52:46.680]  stop see it's an arrogant in-your-face takedown of our country it's not
[52:46.680 --> 52:50.440]  something that's going to help these children either but but before I get
[52:50.440 --> 52:54.240]  into that aspect of it let me give you an idea of the magnitude of it now this
[52:54.240 --> 52:58.640]  is a memo that was leaked a four-page memo by the deputy border patrol chief
[52:58.640 --> 53:03.520]  dated May 30th that contradicts the Obama administration's assertion that the
[53:03.520 --> 53:07.640]  border is secure enough so they can now start legalizing current illegal aliens
[53:07.640 --> 53:12.040]  in the United States now according to this memo from the deputy border patrol
[53:12.040 --> 53:17.920]  chief he says that that he estimates that agents officers and others will
[53:17.920 --> 53:23.040]  apprehend more than 90,000 unaccompanied children on the border this year rising
[53:23.040 --> 53:29.360]  to 142,000 next year last year there were 40,000 so they're looking at this
[53:29.360 --> 53:33.880]  roughly tripling in two years and they say of course chiefly they're coming
[53:33.880 --> 53:38.360]  from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're usually fleeing horrendous
[53:38.360 --> 53:42.560]  poverty or gang violence now where does the horrendous poverty come from it
[53:42.560 --> 53:46.280]  comes from the fact that people like Venezuela and other Central American
[53:46.280 --> 53:51.040]  companies countries have indebted themselves to these bankers as I pointed
[53:51.040 --> 53:57.320]  out 700% return on investment Hugo Chavez gave to these bankers while their
[53:57.320 --> 54:02.000]  people starve in the kind of poverty that makes them try anything including
[54:02.000 --> 54:05.920]  traveling across these dangerous areas and dumping their children in the United
[54:05.920 --> 54:09.520]  States in the vain hope that they're going to be better off here it says they
[54:09.520 --> 54:13.640]  brave harsh conditions in the case of the girls they often face being raped
[54:13.640 --> 54:17.160]  during their journey through Mexico and across the US border well guess what
[54:17.160 --> 54:22.720]  when they get into America it's gonna get even worse in many cases a story
[54:22.720 --> 54:27.720]  breaking out of Virginia today on the DC clothesline calm Virginia congressman
[54:27.720 --> 54:31.560]  admits to the existence of child trafficking in Fairfax County Virginia
[54:31.560 --> 54:35.760]  of course that's right around the Washington DC area of course and we
[54:35.760 --> 54:40.600]  know how many times there have been links with high government officials not
[54:40.600 --> 54:45.360]  just the American government but many governments with child trafficking child
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.720]  sex rings in this particular article he talks about a state department employee
[54:49.720 --> 54:53.760]  with a security clearance of Monica West West Lowellowski I think is how you
[54:53.760 --> 54:58.400]  pronounce the name she had her child stolen by CPS they never charged her or
[54:58.400 --> 55:02.560]  convicted her for any wrongdoing as a parent but because she talked about it
[55:02.560 --> 55:06.760]  to the media the Virginia Department of Family Services has called her now
[55:06.760 --> 55:12.040]  unstable to take revenge because she talked about them taking her child even
[55:12.040 --> 55:16.280]  though they never never charged her with anything even though she's somebody
[55:16.280 --> 55:20.000]  that has security to clearance from the state department so now they've said
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.560]  that she's unstable they're placing her son that that she placed her son in
[55:24.560 --> 55:27.600]  danger by going to the media so they're going to totally strip her of any
[55:27.600 --> 55:34.160]  visitation rights now this person who's writing this article this is Dave Hodges
[55:34.160 --> 55:39.080]  says I have two former Virginia CPS workers who tell me that it's the goal
[55:39.080 --> 55:43.320]  of Virginia CPS to remove as many kids as possible and that evidence is
[55:43.320 --> 55:47.520]  fabricated papers are forged to this end one of those sources is going public
[55:47.520 --> 55:51.360]  sometime in July prior investigations like those of the late Nancy Schaefer
[55:51.360 --> 55:55.880]  claimed that children simply go missing from the care of various CPS's and that
[55:55.880 --> 56:00.000]  these children end up in child sex trafficking rings like the ones identified
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.600]  by Nick Bryant the author of the Franklin scandal and then he points out
[56:04.600 --> 56:10.000]  that Wells Fargo Wachovia was caught in sex trafficking of children and paid
[56:10.000 --> 56:15.640]  $400 million in fines but of course nobody in that bank went to jail and
[56:15.640 --> 56:20.800]  then of course Dincor with ties to the Republicans was also caught doing the
[56:20.800 --> 56:24.800]  same thing and they paid a large fine but again nobody went to jail we've been
[56:24.800 --> 56:29.720]  talking about this for a long time Alex has talked about this over and over and
[56:29.720 --> 56:35.160]  over again so breaks my heart to see people bringing their children across
[56:35.160 --> 56:38.600]  exposing them to these dangers dumping them in the United States just as I
[56:38.600 --> 56:41.840]  pointed out like like parents were doing at Hong Kong Disneyland when they
[56:41.840 --> 56:45.600]  couldn't get in they just put their children over the fences and here have
[56:45.600 --> 56:50.720]  a good time that's what they're doing you can't do that this is a very dangerous
[56:50.720 --> 56:55.720]  world this is a very dangerous country we've had over and over again
[56:55.720 --> 57:02.320]  exposures of child sex trafficking they also are going to become minions of the
[57:02.320 --> 57:06.360]  federal government they're going to see the government as their savior as their
[57:06.360 --> 57:12.280]  daddy this has always been the dream of every tyrannical government going back
[57:12.280 --> 57:16.280]  to Plato's Republic he wanted to destroy the family he wanted the children to see
[57:16.280 --> 57:19.480]  the government as their only family what's going to happen with these
[57:19.480 --> 57:23.480]  children who have no family no cultural connection except to the government
[57:23.480 --> 57:28.840]  that they see as their benefactor that is what Obama and the people who want to
[57:28.840 --> 57:33.600]  take this country down want they want these children to see the government as
[57:33.600 --> 57:39.120]  their family as their benefactor as their protector as their God that's why
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.220]  they're doing this we're going to break it out there's more to this Alex's
[57:42.220 --> 57:46.800]  Jones is going to be with us in the next segment stay tuned
[57:49.680 --> 57:54.240]  a chemical still contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[57:54.240 --> 57:57.760]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[57:57.760 --> 58:01.680]  contaminate what are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking
[58:01.680 --> 58:05.440]  water it's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents my
[58:05.440 --> 58:08.880]  friends water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to

[58:16.320 --> 58:20.240]  week few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies
[58:20.240 --> 58:25.320]  worldwide removed pesticides herbicides chloramines hydrofluorosalic acid
[58:25.320 --> 58:29.800]  sodium hexafluorosilicate chloride it is in teats and coffee it's in water it's
[58:29.800 --> 58:33.680]  in breads and toothpaste it is our responsibility to protect our families

[59:56.520 --> 01:00:05.080]  Broadcasting Network from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:13.400]  lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.720]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we're gonna be joined in
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:22.200]  just a little bit by Alex Jones he's gonna break down what I've been talking
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:27.680]  about in the last segment and that is the uncontrolled immigration of unaccompanied
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.760]  alien children as Homeland Security labels it unaccompanied alien children
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:37.360]  in other words parents and Central and South America where the globalists have
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:43.200]  already gone in collapsed the economy there giving massive returns to the
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.240]  bankers who are running those countries putting them into debt as we've seen
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.360]  going back to the days of Robert McNamara the World Bank where they were
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.200]  increasing the debt of these third world countries by up to 20% a year
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:01.240]  essentially trying to take control of everything creating a new feudalism
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.040]  where no one owned anything now of course we were told that the socialist
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.000]  revolutions were going to push back against that kind of rent seeking that
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.960]  kind of neocolonialism but then we look at somebody like Hugo Chavez he's the
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:19.560]  one that Bloomberg is talking about giving a 700% return to the bankers and
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:25.160]  at the same time his successor is paying off Barclays is bragging about how
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.480]  they're going to take care of their sovereign debt first even though they've
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.280]  had over 40 people die because they can't get water and in just the last
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.440]  couple months they can't get water they can't get medicine they have to leave
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.640]  that country that socialist paradise where they were told that all this was
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.560]  being done for the little man they were pushing back against the big
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.520]  corporations against the big multinational corporations and bankers
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.240]  and yet those are the ones who are benefiting just as we see here in
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:56.080]  America with Obamacare that it's the large corporations who are benefiting at
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.960]  the expense of the middle class at the expense of the lower class people who
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.680]  can no longer get jobs at the lower end because the companies cannot afford to
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.080]  keep them on as full-time employees cutting their hours maybe cutting their
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.800]  jobs entirely because they're having to buy insurance policies that cover
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.160]  everything things that they will never use I pointed out young men having to
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:23.160]  have policies that cover maternity leave child raising that you can't put that
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.080]  kind of stuff in and have people be able to afford the insurance policies of
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.400]  course if they opt out now they're counting the money on the other side and
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.240]  that is they think that maybe four million people will opt out and that will
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:38.920]  give them four billion dollars in new taxes about a thousand dollars a person
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:44.680]  that's the way they're rolling it's all about either control or taking your
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:49.760]  money transferring it to a corporation but it's not just that it's dangerous for
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.280]  the children it's not just that they're bankrupting their countries and now
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.560]  they're going to bankrupt our country and what they're going to do is they're
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.880]  going to use these children with no connection to their families to
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:05.960]  balkanize this country to weigh down our welfare system you cannot have a
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.280]  welfare system and open borders at the same time even if you want to argue that
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.880]  you can have one or the other you cannot have both of them at the same time you
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:21.800]  can't have unrestricted immigration and have everything provided or even much
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.840]  of what people need education food allowances you can't provide that for
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.040]  everybody just by opening up the border so you can't have a welfare state and
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.840]  open borders without destroying the country but of course we believe that
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:40.520]  is the plan of the Obama administration what they would like to do is have
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:45.480]  essentially a 1984 on the top and a brave new world on the bottom in other
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.160]  words if you come in if you're a citizen here and you want to just kick back
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.400]  into a kind of hedonistic brave new world at the bottom zone out watch sports
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.600]  watch entertainment watch their reality television which is not reality at all if
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.240]  you want to do that they'll leave you alone like they did the pearls in 1984
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.960]  but if you don't want to do that or if you're part of the infrastructure part
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.840]  of the bureaucracy when the government once the government owns everything
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.600]  nobody will have any won't be a middle class or won't be any businesses like
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.600]  there are today but today if you're if you have a business if you're part of
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.480]  the middle class or even if you're part of the government bureaucracy they're
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:26.880]  going to monitor you with a 1984 police state on the top just to make sure that
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.400]  everything stays compartmentalized just to make sure that you're not a dissident
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.000]  just to make sure that you're not dangerous to them that's what we see
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  but then the next step that they're coming at is global depopulation they
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.480]  don't need us they've got robots to do the lower work and that's what they're
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:58.480]  working on Alice is going to break that down for us in the next segment stay tuned
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.400]  hi folks Alex Jones here with some important information I want to tell
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.600]  you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my patriot supply
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:10.600]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.080]  the direction this country was headed and the charlottes willing to sell us out
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:18.400]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.080]  patriots was born my patriot supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.760]  funding they now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.640]  hard-working American men and women it is rare to find companies who practice
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.160]  what they preach and that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storeable

[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:06.040]  there are of course those who do not want us to speak we think just let me say
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:11.160]  even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will be on
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.300]  their way it's chances that why because while the
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:20.000]  truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation words will always retain
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.200]  their power words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen the
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:31.920]  annunciation of truth there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.160]  that you decided sir you wanted it foolproof you told me every television
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.400]  in London cruelty and intolerance and depravity and where once you had the
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:45.080]  freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:48.360]  systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.200]  cameras how did this happen who's to blame
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.360]  well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others they will be
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:02.440]  held accountable but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:08.960]  need only look into a mirror I know why you did it I know you were afraid who
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:14.440]  wouldn't be war terror disease there were a myriad of problems which
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:19.920]  inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense fear got the
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:24.160]  best of you and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor Adam
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.000]  Sutler he promised you order he promised you peace and all he demanded in
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.600]  return was your silent obedient consent
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:44.480]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:52.560]  time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.120]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in Austin and we've been
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.480]  talking about immigration rising soaring immigration as same time of course
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:07.520]  unemployment is rising and soaring and the connections between that we've got
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:14.160]  Alex Jones here with his take Alex David thanks for hosting the show on this
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:25.360]  8th day can't believe that we're already well in to this month of of tyranny we
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:33.400]  are seeing such incredible betrayals in this nation as even mainstream controlled
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.600]  state-run media admits that Latin America that's in the middle of a giant
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.320]  depression is just telling their children get to America and we're talking
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.880]  five-year-olds 15-year-olds you name it are being given money and sent into
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:52.680]  Mexico sent into the border states pouring in from Venezuela Nicaragua
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:58.680]  El Salvador Brazil they have got hundreds of thousands of children under
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.400]  the age of 10 at different facilities they've got thousands of them at a
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.640]  facility just down in San Antonio and the Obama administration is saying yes
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.080]  we will take your children and they will stay here which is only incentivizing
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.720]  more of the seven plus million people that live outside of the United States
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.920]  mainly Latin America who's able to get here but from China you name it are just
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:27.760]  pouring in to this country in mass and then if you can get here as adults you
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.640]  can have a baby free you can have welfare just pull the lever to take the
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:35.440]  guns just pull the lever for socialism just pull the lever for banker bailouts
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:42.080]  and the Republican leadership is going along with every bit of this because
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.000]  they've been bought and paid for by the same interest and they are openly working
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.560]  with the leadership of the Democratic Party the Republicans are to target the
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:56.720]  Tea Party the real resistance to the globalist takeover the Republicans
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.640]  tried to co-op the Tea Party they couldn't do it now it's taking them over
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.840]  and so the establishment's trying to kill it right now but none of the media
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.760]  other than infowars.com and places like drudgereport.com I know Drudge on
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:13.840]  Friday when we co-hosted together covered all of this the fact that we've
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:20.720]  got even with federal cooked books on unemployment and on people on welfare
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:30.480]  92 million Americans not working labor force at 16 year low 7 million have
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.880]  left under Obama lethargic economy and you've got at least 30 million
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.520]  illegals undocumented who will vote for the destruction of this country over
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:46.440]  90% of them end up voting on record for a socialist globalist agenda and again
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.360]  the big corporations Walmart and others admit they tell their employees go out
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.240]  and get on welfare as a subsidy because you can't survive on what we pay you well
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.640]  it's the same thing with the illegals they get a subsidy of welfare most of
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.600]  them are on welfare no ID needed they're able to get three or four different
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.040]  IDs from the Mexico and Consulate that all the major banks accept the AP
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.400]  reports and so they're above the law getting welfare as a supplement while
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.560]  their husbands do go and work many of them working hard and it's destroying
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:21.320]  the economy and collectivizing the economy just like Chinese slave goods
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.600]  have done this is a designed system to break this culture down I know you're
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.760]  going to be taking calls coming up at the bottom of the hour and breaking this
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.680]  down and I want to hear from the listeners on this because because
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.160]  undoubtedly NAFTA and GAAP were meant to domesticate this country and written
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.880]  as one-sided trade deals and Ross Perot was right but undoubtedly now we're
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:47.520]  going into this managed global economy David and we can see that the cheap
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:53.160]  firm world labor is bankrupting Europe Spain and Italy and Greece and others
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.800]  that were prosperous just a decade ago are imploding with cheap third-world
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.520]  labor as well they use African and Eastern European and Asian and Turkish
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:06.800]  labor there Middle Eastern labor to undercut people and again it doesn't
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.720]  create a free market when you've got imploded third-world nations pouring in
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.000]  who get government subsidies on top of it that isn't a free market like 150
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.560]  years ago poor European immigrants or others coming here that isn't the type
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:28.760]  of cheap labor that produces a large middle-class labor later we know it
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.000]  creates economic destruction we can see the proof and then you have the
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.680]  globalist the big mega banks the big recipients of the Baker bailouts by the
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.880]  trillions like Warren Buffett lobbying for open borders lobbying for higher
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:46.520]  taxes on the middle class while they themselves are basically exempt it's a
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:52.000]  perfect managed economy system to bring us to our knees financially totally
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.360]  break us so that we are nothing but financial vassals we are being conquered
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:02.000]  by 21st century high-tech economic warfare and this country is being swamped
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.040]  right now if they legalize the 30 million illegals by fiat and stop the
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:10.120]  deportations as Obama has already done outside of Congress and Congress won't
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:14.960]  impeach him it sends a message to the world that if you can get here you're
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.480]  gonna be legal and you're gonna be given a silver spoon in your mouth so come
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.800]  here and as long as your anti-gun anti-liberty as long as you hate 1776
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.760]  you're welcome what a sickening story David Knight yeah Alex you know we we
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.840]  look at this surging immigration what what were once anchor babies are now
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:38.040]  becoming children coming into this society and further down the road another
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.200]  story that a judge had up last week the end of the week was the dawn of the
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:46.800]  robot revolution as army machines as armies of machines escape the factory
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.440]  of course robots are coming is not necessarily going to be uncontrolled
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.360]  immigration that takes our jobs in the future it's not going to necessarily be
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.440]  Mexicans it's going to be metal cans that are coming out here what they're
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.920]  talking by the way that's the perfect storm at the globalist all the breakers
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.400]  well to you name it is a bigger brzezinski right about and talk about is
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:07.880]  that it's a design system to use a giant wave of human labor to drive down
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.960]  human worth and then you have unlimited resources and rare earth minerals
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.880]  basically to have huge automated factories run by robots service by robots
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:22.600]  that that humans don't even know how to run now in many cases pouring out
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.920]  ground drones ground cars ground tanks ground ships ground subs ground cruise
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:34.840]  missiles this is a station extinction human obsolescence movement where the
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.840]  architecture of the world has been designed to bring this into fruition
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:43.840]  France says they plan to have a robot race with China to replace humans with
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.360]  robots in the next 10 years in their factories this is everything Bill Joy
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.640]  talked about David oh yeah when I was in Europe and reading the European papers
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.640]  most of the financial news was about what's going on in China and I tell you
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:00.480]  why France is they may brag about the fight they're going to take China on on
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.440]  robots but they are way way way behind as a matter of fact China was number one
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:11.280]  the US was number three I believe and I think Japan was was to Japan and the
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.280]  US are very close to each other China was way ahead and growing at a much much
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.040]  faster rate I don't that if you want to know the model if you want to know the
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:24.560]  model of the world folks China they admit is the globalist model suicide nets
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.160]  at the Apple factories forced abortions at the Apple factories total
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:33.440]  tyranny forced drugging children chained up on light poles to defecate on the
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.800]  street and you can get one meal a day while their parents work in factories
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.880]  with engineering degrees and ladies this is mainstream news this is what we're
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:47.400]  competing against this is our future except soon now now Foxcom the Apple
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:51.680]  company that they use announced this year you can pull it up we'll pull it up
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.400]  the next segment and show people they plan to replace all of their 10 million
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.880]  workers with robots and have already done it with a million workers
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:03.960]  general what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:08.360]  Monday about a potential court situation the police are shoving people shoving
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:14.520]  Alex shoving the crowd whether it's the radio show the news websites documentary

[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.520]  West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated what are the health effects
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:13.240]  of having these drugs in our drinking water. It's forced medical treatment
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.800]  without the consent of residents. My friend's water filtration is one of the
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.080]  most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.920]  harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water. On average the county says it
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:28.440]  sprays with glyphosate at least once a week. Few filters cut out the glyphosate
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:32.480]  that is found in water supplies worldwide. Remove pesticides, herbicides,
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:37.840]  chloramines, hydrofluorosilic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate. All right it is
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.320]  in teats and coffees and waters and breads and toothpaste. It is our

[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:33.320]  Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network Network.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:39.800]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:46.760]  choose sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the info war. Welcome
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:51.120]  back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and I have on Skype Alex Jones
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.600]  on this June 8th edition of the Alex Jones show. Now we were talking just
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:58.560]  before the break and we've been talking this whole program about the effect of
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:05.000]  uncontrolled immigration on employment. But what about the future? Well we say
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  that's going to be coming. The threat in the future is not necessarily going to be
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.600]  people taking our jobs, but it's going to be machines taking our jobs. And as we
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:15.720]  pointed out in this article, one of the quotes from it, they said beyond defense,
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.600]  the biggest non-industrial market for robots are gonna be things like
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.640]  agriculture, health care. Okay, that's where they're coming in. But notice that
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.400]  they said beyond defense, that is the biggest market for robotics. That should
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:31.200]  scare us all shitting at Alex. And they've openly said, and now it's being
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:36.720]  announced in the news, I told people ten years ago, that MIT and others said
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.080]  first the cars will roll out limited, then we'll show the robot cars are
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:45.200]  better than humans, then we'll give you higher insurance if you don't let the
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:49.800]  robot drive, then we'll phase out humans driving entirely. And Bill Joy wrote in
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:54.240]  2000 April issue of Wired Magazine, billionaire owner of some micro systems,
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:22:00.080]  that again, he went to a meeting of 200 plus top tech owners. And they made the
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.960]  decision at the meeting, they said no, the consensus is we're just not gonna let
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:08.320]  humanity live and just play games and watch movies all day. We're gonna phase
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.520]  out humanity as we know it. We're gonna merge with machines. And again, the
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:17.040]  architecture has already been decided, the future's already been decided, no
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.600]  one's being consulted. They've got us fighting with each other over what
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:28.040]  color we are when the decision has been made publicly. Zbigniew Brzezinski, all
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.840]  of them have written, Ray Kurzweil, Bill Joy, all of them. I mean, it's in all the
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:36.480]  tech magazines now. When I was first telling people this 18, 19 years ago,
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:41.240]  folks thought I was nuts. Now it's out in the open, people are just being
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:47.840]  acclimated like wall Martians, you know, wandering around. And I'm frantic because
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:54.560]  everything I warned people about is now becoming passé and just happening. And
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:00.240]  again, it's an anti-human move. We should be using machines to empower us to go to
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:05.200]  the stars. They decided humans will never even go to space. Homo sapiens sapiens
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.520]  will never even go to space. The globalists openly say that, that they're
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:11.000]  gonna merge with machines and they'll go to space. Well, I mean, who made them God?
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.280]  And then all the tech they build has backdoors that control us. So I hope
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:20.080]  people out there on the immigration issue understand, we feel for those in
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:24.560]  Latin America under globalist enslavement. We covered that earlier. And the
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.360]  Bloomberg article admitting that they're cutting the drinking water off to pay
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:31.960]  the globalist debts that were set up as frauds. They're imploding the third
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.320]  world to then implode the first world where only the globalist in government
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:41.080]  and university and institution reservations are above the law tax exempt
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:46.320]  with the high technology where everybody else is in total squalor to remove
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.960]  the wealth out of the system so that we're totally dependent on them and
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:54.320]  only looking for food to eat and on government assistance to get the food
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:59.160]  while robot factories, I need to explain this to people because this is, this is
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.760]  the key to everything. First, they use third world labor and Chinese slave
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:06.880]  goods to leverage out the whole world, destroy the artisan class, the middle
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:13.400]  class factory workers section, the local decentralized privately held factory
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:19.120]  system in the West, in Europe, in the United States, in Canada, in Australia.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.200]  Then they roll in giant third world collapse populations because the race
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.120]  at the bottom actually brought them down a level, forced them off their agra
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:33.240]  areas from Africa to Latin America to Asia on record as in a 21 into the big
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.960]  cities to work as slaves. Now those factories are imploding, there's no jobs,
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.480]  they're being replaced with robots. In the next phase you flood the first world,
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.560]  this is the state of plant folks, I'm giving it to you right now, flooding the
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:49.160]  first world with the third world population who you radicalize into
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.880]  socialism to overthrow the old West collapsing that, then you seal the
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:59.000]  borders, keep those contained once you have the political unit controlled and
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.200]  then you start killing off the giant third world countries with bioweapon
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:09.120]  releases, you use the backlash against the immigrants in the phase two to then
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:14.040]  fortress your country, then that fortress is used to keep the bioweapon out
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:18.800]  when you wipe out the third world in phase three. Then after you've wiped out
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.360]  the third world and killed say seven billion people by that time, so it'll be
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.440]  about nine million when they run the call operation in their own admissions,
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:29.560]  we're seven and a half bill right now, about 2020, 2025 when they do the mass
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.840]  extermination of the third world, then hyper police state comes in in the first
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.800]  world that's left, and of course Vyfer Vendetta is all about this, I told you
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.320]  about the mass plague operation before that movie, but I know the Wachowsky
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.960]  brothers are listeners, that's on record, but the whole point is is they
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.720]  inculcated that in that they use a bio plague to bring in the tyranny and then
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:53.120]  England prevails, England's the only country left, that's a icon for the
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.960]  first world, and then they finally start selective bioweapon releases within
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.640]  the first world to reduce it down to 100 million that David Rockefeller, Prince
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:10.840]  Philip, Prince Bernhard, Prince Charles, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, who's the
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:16.000]  big one, the CNN guy, Ted Turner, they're all eugenicists, they're all
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.440]  eugenics meetings, that's ABC News, CBS News, that's the cult, and this is the plan,
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:25.160]  so they're gonna phase this out with robots and human labor, call us down, get
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.480]  us to where we do everything we're told, just to be able to get the government
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.120]  check, even if we work in a private factory, we'll be controlled by that,
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:37.440]  and then they're gonna release the final bioweapon plagues, or have robots
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.080]  basically sent out to call the rest of us that are left, because the big
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.240]  life of the bureaucratic class is, there's not gonna be 100 million left,
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.960]  they only tell the bureaucrats and the Dr. Derek Pionkas and people that are
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.720]  going along with it, they only tell them that so they feel like they can be part
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.520]  of this plan, when you read the deeper writings, they say humans are a plague,
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:02.720]  all humans will be exterminated, only the one supreme God being, Ray Kurzweil
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.800]  says he will become God, he doesn't believe in God now, but believes he will
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:11.880]  become God, there will only be one being left, because the final computer human
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.960]  beings will fight with each other over supremacy, now that sounds insane,
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.400]  because it is insane, I'm not saying that's going to happen, but I'm saying
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.680]  this is the program, this is the plan that we've laid out today, and that's why
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:27.880]  I start hyperventilating, because it's all public, it's all public and it's
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:32.720]  unfolding now, so the immigration issue is only one piece of it, they use our
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:36.520]  goodwill, our caring for the third world, our caring for third world people,
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.520]  wanting to help them to help them, we can't help seven million people, we have
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:44.600]  to get liberty in their countries, let's see if they can't use the West as a
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.520]  steam valve, those countries will have revolutions and reform themselves, the
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.880]  globalists are steering us in disaster by design, that's what I'm trying to
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.360]  break down, you're living in a science fiction movie, I'm begging everyone out
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.880]  there, please listen to me and realize how much danger you're in, spread the
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.560]  word about the broadcast, I know that we have the documents, we have the proof, we
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.200]  have the facts at infowars.com, you've seen it all start to unfold and come
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:14.000]  through, I'm not a pessimist, I believe if we admit how serious things are, we have
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.320]  a chance to stop it, and I believe that if we get past the fear and realize that
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:22.160]  we can change the world and realize the globalist program, we can reverse all
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:27.840]  this, what the plan is so over the top, so evil, so out of control, only admitting
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:32.840]  how diabolical it is can allow us to stand up against it, people have to
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.560]  realize there's no future if we don't turn this around, David Knight's coming up
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:41.920]  with the calls, I'll be back this entire week live in studio in Austin all three

[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:03.440]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties. This
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.800]  year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:10.720]  contaminate. What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:14.440]  water? It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents. My
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.880]  friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:21.200]  protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:25.320]  tap water. On average the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:29.240]  week. Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:34.320]  worldwide. Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid,
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:38.940]  sodium hexafluorosilicate. Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:42.680]  breads and toothpaste. It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:46.360]  The establishment's not going to do it. It's time to take action. It's time to

[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:07.600]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.520]  Network.
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:18.680]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:27.440]  GCN Radio Network. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on the Sunday, June 8th,
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:33.200]  2014. Now in the last segment, Alex is breaking down the globalist plan to take
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:37.640]  down not only our country but the entire world. And we've seen this plan
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:42.960]  unfolding. I want to get your take on it. I want your calls. That's 877-789-
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:51.120]  Alex or 877-789-2539. Now tomorrow, Alex is going to be talking to Dinesh
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:56.120]  D'Souza. Of course, he's a filmmaker, documentarian, and he's the one that
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:00.240]  Obama is trying to put in jail. As his producer said, the same guy who produced
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:05.720]  Schindler's List said, this administration sees its opponents not as
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:12.080]  dissenters but as enemies. If they can't refute you, they try to lock you up. Now
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:17.120]  that's the guy who produced the new documentary that Dinesh D'Souza is doing.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:20.200]  He produced his previous film, I believe, but he also produced Schindler's List.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:24.760]  That's Gerald Mullen. And Dinesh D'Souza is going to be Alex's guest tomorrow when
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:29.920]  he returns to the radio show live here in Austin for this next week. He's been
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.000]  on vacation the last week or so. A well-deserved vacation. He's going to be
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  back this entire week, all three hours every day. And he'll also be joined
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.720]  tomorrow with George Humphries, a guest that he's had on in the past. Very
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.000]  interesting show tomorrow. But as I point out, give us your take on what's
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.920]  happening. It's 877-789-Alex. That's 2539. We've been talking about the plan
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.880]  Balkanization of America, the implosion of the economy, the destruction of
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:57.920]  privacy and due process. We talked about what's going on with the NSA and the
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.240]  courts, as well as the fact that we now are looking at the strong possibility
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:08.680]  being hinted at by many economists, many financial writers, that negative interest
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:12.320]  rates that are being talked about by the European Central Bank will be coming to
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:16.800]  the United States along with cash controls that they've been floating as
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:21.600]  trial balloons in the European Union as well. You know, when we look at what
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.880]  they're doing to these children in Central and South America, it's much
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.840]  cleverer than what the American government did at the time that they were
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:33.360]  fighting the American Indians. When they fought the Indians out west, what they
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.200]  did is they conquered these individual tribes, they took their children and
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:40.800]  shipped them back east to schools, separated them from their families, from
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:46.280]  their culture, from any roots that they might have. In order to make them tied
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.400]  into the American government in a way that they never would be if they weren't
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:52.960]  separated from their children, if they weren't educated in isolation by the
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:57.760]  state, now they're much more clever about it. That was done by force. Now what
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:02.400]  they're doing is they're doing it by incentive. They've gone into these third
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:07.120]  world countries, as we pointed out, destroyed the economy and Hugo Chavez's
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:12.680]  socialist utopia. The bankers get 700% return on their investment and the
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:16.720]  people there don't get water and medicine because, of course, Barclays
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:21.160]  brags that they're going to pay their sovereign debt before the people get to
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:26.400]  eat. That's what socialism does for you. That's how it works hand-in-glove with
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:31.720]  the globalist agenda. Now, as Alex was just saying, the globalists are stepping
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:36.400]  up their endgame. They're getting closer. We're seeing that much of their plan is
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.920]  working. We need to fight back against that, but we also need to fight back
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.040]  individually to take care of our own families, to take care of ourselves. There
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:47.040]  are certain things that we can do. One of those is to support our sponsor for
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:52.160]  this hour, MyPatriot Supply. And the day is coming when America, the America that
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:57.200]  we know and love will then be a distant memory, but patriots everywhere are
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.160]  getting prepared and they're doing it with one of my favorite companies,

[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:54.480]  Fred? David, can you hear me? Yes, go ahead. I want to talk about the Chinese
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:38:00.720]  long-term plan of moving population. Ten population, which is what China, the
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:06.000]  Chinese ethnic group is, into five areas. Manchuria is really the homeland of the
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:17.400]  Manchus. Do not have the Sinkiang region or Uyghur region, the Tibetan region, both
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:27.040]  eastern and western Tibet, Mongolia. They use secrecy in the whole 20th century.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:34.400]  They've been moving into areas where they may claim land, but also these other
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:37.960]  these other lands have had nationalist movement, long-standing nationalist
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:44.080]  movements, even going back centuries. And Russia never really was willing to
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:50.480]  oppose them because they also like to colonize those areas. China was
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:54.560]  invaded by a lot of Russian. That's right. I think a lot of people don't realize just
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.320]  how segmented China is. There's a lot of different languages there.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:03.040]  Most people, there's a lot of Chinese who don't speak Mandarin. When we adopted
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.120]  our daughter from China, we got her from the southern part of China where they
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:12.160]  speak what we call Cantonese. And as we moved her around, there were a lot of
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.480]  people who couldn't understand anything she was saying. Of course, we couldn't
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:18.520]  either. But they have a lot of different dialects, is the point. And it's very
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.600]  easy for them to pit one group against another when you have that kind of a
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.800]  situation. It leads to a balkanization. That's one of the things that concerns me
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:30.960]  about bringing in so many people from South America. You know, it's when you
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:34.400]  bring in different cultures and different language groups, it's very easy for
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.360]  them to pit those groups against each other. As Alex pointed out when we were
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.440]  talking about the 25th anniversary of Tiananmen Square, the Chinese brought in
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.480]  troops from other areas who didn't speak the language, who considered
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.120]  themselves to be different in many ways. Culturally or whatever, even though they
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:52.520]  may look the same to us, even though we don't understand either language or we
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:56.280]  think they're somewhat homogeneous, they brought in these other groups in order
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:59.560]  to suppress the demonstrators there. That's what's so dangerous about this, is
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:04.840]  the kind of balkanization. Go ahead. David, can I just say that they're using
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:10.320]  the language, they're using the phrase ethnic minorities, when in fact, either
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:15.960]  now or until very recently, these homelands have had ethnic majority of
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:23.200]  those other non-Chinese people. So they're using this propaganda of
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:27.800]  saying, well, we're providing for these ethnic minorities. These areas do not
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:33.520]  have those populations as a minority. It's the Chinese that are a minority in
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:40.000]  a lot of cases. And what they do is they just will invade and colonize and
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:45.480]  move in until they become a minority. But during that initial period,
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:51.960]  they have a complete secrecy clamped down. Have you ever heard of any kind of
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:59.680]  Uyghur media or Tibetan media or Manchu media or Mongolian media? Well, that's
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.440]  true. That's why it is so vitally important for us to keep our media alive
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:08.840]  and to not allow the government to gain control of the internet through these
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:13.120]  kinds of corporate maneuvers that we see happening through the FCC. They now want
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:18.960]  to, they've given signals that they want to try to control content. And the fact
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:22.080]  that they're going to use net neutrality, that's going to be in a very
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:28.160]  effective way, especially once Comcast has its merger with the number two
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:34.240]  internet provider. That's going to create a giant corporation, if the FCC allows it,
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.800]  that could then leverage this net neutrality where people have to pay in
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:45.640]  order to get a reasonable internet speed. That's going to be a very chilling
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:49.120]  effect on free speech and on the creation of new media. As you say, there's no
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:53.560]  Tibetan media that we hear anywhere. There's not going to be any new bloggers
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.560]  coming up. That's the thing we've loved about the internet is that someone can
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:00.840]  rise up. They can come up with their content. And if it's compelling content,
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:05.680]  if it's original content, they've had a level playing field. That's what they
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.800]  want to destroy with the coming net neutrality. Thank you so much for the
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:15.120]  call. Let's go to Zach in Wisconsin. Zach? Hey David, I just wanted to make a
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.640]  quick point about these illegal immigrants. They're not just coming into
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:24.640]  the United States to destroy our economy. I think the globalists are sending
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:28.480]  them in to also destroy our civil liberties. I mean, we can see that with
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:33.800]  the Fourth Amendment free zones along the border. Yes. And looking at a
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:38.320]  Huffington Post article right here that says Hispanics are way less likely to
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:44.040]  own guns than blacks or whites. And so when they vote on, oh, we need more firearm
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.280]  restrictions, then Hispanics are just going to vote along, you know, the globalist
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.960]  agenda line. Yes, absolutely. If they cut off, if these children come in and
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:57.920]  they're raised in the American schools by the government and they have no idea of
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.520]  our heritage, they're not going to value it, we'll be right back with more of your
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:04.040]  call. This is Scotys John for Infowars.com. I know that most of you here in
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:07.760]  this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:11.480]  other issues covered here at Infowars. The question is, do your friends and
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:15.680]  family know? If not, then I want to know why. Oh, I know it's tough to talk about
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:18.920]  this with some people. They might call you names, or they just want to talk
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:23.800]  about sports. They're so poppers. I say so what? There's a battle going on out there
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:28.440]  right now. The ammunition is information and the soldiers are you. It's time to
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:32.560]  transform your game from passive listener to active participant. We from
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:35.680]  Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:39.880]  thousand years, and I'm still fighting. If we don't all stand up right now, we're
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.000]  going to lose everything. The Infowar is worldwide. Tell your friends about
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.760]  Infowars and let them know that Infowars doesn't print bull. It's real
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:52.120]  journalism and news backed up by documented fact. Step up and take your

[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:02.320]  The truth will set them free. I don't know what it is. Ralph just won't pay any
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:05.920]  attention to me. When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.680]  games and go to sleep. It's like I don't even exist. Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:14.420]  Does this seem familiar? If the answer to this question is yes, then listen
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:18.800]  carefully. Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics,
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.440]  contaminator water supplies. Many of these toxic additives are deliberately
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:26.480]  engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity. It's part of the eugenics
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:30.640]  population control movement. Look it up. If men are more interested in online
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:35.120]  gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to

[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:05.440]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:09.920]  war situation? The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.800]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:19.200]  nightly news, Infowars is the tip of the spear. Is this another false-flight stage
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.400]  attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeland security or sticking
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:26.320]  hands on our pants on the streets? It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.640]  of men and women everywhere and that's what PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:36.240]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:41.120]  weapons against the so-called rebels. What we see now is a war against reality,
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:45.280]  it's a war against the truth. It's more vital than ever that supporters of

[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:06.800]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot. It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:12.480]  deposit of the highest-purity iodine available. The new survival shield X2
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:20.160]  is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:27.600]  conditions. The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million-plus
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:34.160]  year-old deposit deep in the earth. It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:41.760]  today. It delivers 650 micrograms per drop. Experience the new formula, experience

[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:30.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:36.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and this is our last segment. We're taking
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:41.920]  your calls on immigration, on the endgame of the globalists as we've been talking about,
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:50.480]  how they are bringing in a huge number of children by themselves to be raised in America. It's not
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:57.680]  only a collapsing of the economy economically, but it's a balkanization of the country as well,
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:02.240]  many different disturbing aspects of it. But of course, they've already had their own economies
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:08.000]  eviscerated by the bankers whose next step is not necessarily to threaten your job
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.520]  using immigrants from Mexico. It's not the Mexicans you need to worry about, it's the metal cans
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:20.000]  that are going to replace all of us. We just had a robotics fair in Munich. This is an article
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.560]  from the London Financial Times that Drudge picked up last week where they're talking about the dawn
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:30.560]  of a robot revolution as an army of machines escapes the factory. Now, of course, they talk about it
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:36.080]  as being beyond defense the biggest non-industrial markets for robots or agriculture and healthcare.
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:42.080]  Now, of course, what they mean is, in other words, the military is the number one market for these
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:47.200]  robots, not really even the factories. But for the first time this year, one of the aspects of
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:54.000]  this article is that they had an entire section about service robots. You see, it's not just
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:59.440]  manufacturing that's going away. You're going to lose the service economy as well when these
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:03.680]  robots start driving trucks instead of truck drivers. Listen to some of the other ones that
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:09.520]  they've got here. They've got a caribot that sweeps office floors and empties waste paper bins.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:15.200]  You've got another one from Stockbot, which walks the aisles in a shop or a warehouse to check
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.480]  inventory at night. Or you've got autonomous vehicles, ferrying laundry or waste around
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:25.440]  hospitals. And of course, they're going to be ferrying everything on the roads as they replace
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:31.520]  truck drivers, as I just mentioned, with self-driving trucks. The service economy is going to go away
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:37.440]  just as we've seen the manufacturing economy melt away. We have Chris and Indiana want to talk
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:44.080]  about robots. Chris, what do you want to say about robots? Hi, David. Hi. Go ahead. What do you want
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:50.800]  to say about robots? There's a couple things. There's one, a whistleblower in the way when it
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:55.680]  comes to my profession. But first of all, I wanted to say that all of this has to do with that movie
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:02.400]  Elysium, which desensitizes us to and conditions us to accept socialist health care, open borders,
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:10.880]  brain chips, robot workers, communist government, coups and so forth. And yeah, exactly. And I work
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:15.520]  in the health care system as a medical technologist, cytotechnologist, want to be technical about it.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:25.520]  And I screen a lot of slides that need analysis. And I can understand what is abnormal and normal
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:31.120]  and now the papillomavirus, you know, the pap smear is under a microscope taken.
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:39.840]  It's a slide sample is being taken and we analyze them. And now the FDA is moving towards
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:48.640]  just pure HPV testing that is by a robot, even though that the numbers, it used to be one of the
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:56.880]  biggest causes of women's death in this country up until 1955. And since 1955 until 1992, those
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:02.240]  are the steps that looked up and declined by 60%. And I think that says a lot to do with Obamacare.
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:06.080]  I mean, what is it? What used to be the biggest cause of death in women? What was it that you
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:14.640]  said it declined? Cervical cancer. Worldwide, it actually remains to be one of the highest
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:21.040]  causes of women's death. But in the U.S., it used to be about second or third and now it's 14th
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:30.080]  in 1955. And it's all due to that screening of papillomavirus testing and they're all going to
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:39.840]  robot. And it hasn't even become clear yet. You look up that FDA approves Roche screening,
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:46.880]  Roche robot screening. The company's Roche and it's ROCHE.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:51.280]  Yeah, they're moving into all different areas as they were pointing out that they had a lot of
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:57.280]  things in this robotics fair in Munich that were focused on healthcare. Thank you so much,
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:02.240]  Chris and Indiana. You know, there's been pretty heavy news today. And so I guess maybe one of
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:07.280]  the ways that we can push back against this is kind of by satirizing it. You know, robots
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:11.760]  are not only concentrating wealth in the hands of a technocratic elite, but they're also
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:19.040]  going to give a monopoly of force to a few people. That's one of the things that really concerns us.
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:24.560]  As I mentioned before, again, the biggest market is for the military. When DARPA is looking at these
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:27.600]  robots, they like to sell them to the public as saying, you know, they're going to help you
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:32.320]  in a disaster if it's an earthquake or if it's a nuclear reactor that they came by. That's not
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:40.400]  the brief of DARPA. DARPA is a defense research agency. They're looking for military uses of
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:44.000]  these robots. So when you see these things running faster than humans, when you see them
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:49.440]  walking around, you know, running on two legs or running on four legs, like a faster than a jaguar,
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:54.240]  what, that's what they're looking at. They're looking at robots that are going to take people
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:59.120]  on that are going to be used for crowd control or going to be used to hunt people down. But there's
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:05.280]  a funny article on The Onion about the police use of robots, just as the last caller was talking
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:10.480]  about Elysium and how they showed the police brutalizing people. I had high hopes for that
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:15.680]  movie, but it turned out, as he pointed out, just to be predictive programming, trying to get people
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:21.680]  to accept some of the things. Just putting forward this whole immigration, Obamacare issue, it really
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:27.760]  wasn't pushing back against the out of control use of robotics in the police, but this Onion article
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:33.920]  does. And this is titled new law enforcement robot can wield excessive force of five human
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:38.560]  officers. And in this phony article, the satire, they say the Houston police department has developed
[01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:43.440]  a new line of law enforcement robots capable of wielding the excessive force of five human
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:47.760]  officers. They quote an engineer who says, we've done extensive testing with the AP 12. We can
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:51.680]  say these units are capable of carrying out everyday police work just as proficiently as any
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:57.360]  member of our force, whether it's dispersing peaceful protesters by blasting a 14 nozzle pepper
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:01.760]  spray cannon or reacting to reports of suspicious behavior by immediately striking the knees,
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:06.400]  face and throat of a potential suspect up to 10 times harder than its human counterpart.
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:10.480]  Thanks to these robotic units, our deputies can rest assured that their work will be performed
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:14.960]  the same standards we have always expected from our patrolmen. And I said, I've outfitted them with
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:20.160]  numerous features that make it ideal to abruptly resort to extreme measures, including a highly
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:25.920]  sensitive motion detector that perceives most gestures as an act of resistance necessitating
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:31.840]  physical force. And additionally, the robots possess a powerful hydraulic grasping system,
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:36.160]  enabling them to repeatedly slam subjects of any size and weight against fences,
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:42.160]  dumpsters and car hoods with previously unattainable levels of aggression. That's from the onion,
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:49.680]  making fun of our police who have been using new rules of engagement and excessive force. And
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:55.920]  of course, you can always replace them with robots who will do a much more efficient job. We're
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.840]  nearly out of time, but let's go to one more call here. Daniel and Austin, you wanted to talk about
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:07.920]  immigration. Go ahead, Daniel. We don't have Daniel there. Let's go to Andrew and Andrew in
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:13.440]  Pennsylvania. Did you want to talk about depopulation and colonizing space? Yeah, that's what Alex said
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:17.760]  about that. It has been said by some globalist researchers that at least half of the globalist
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:22.400]  forces, the globalist factions, do not want to depopulate the earth. They actually want to
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:26.560]  microchip the entire earth, like Aaron Russo talked about, so they can take away the free will of
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:31.040]  humanity to make us act in malevolent ways. So as far as their colonizing space agenda,
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:35.200]  they can turn humanity into a cosmic war machine. And yes, the Star Wars galactic empire has
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:39.520]  disclosure in your face about this. Well, it's interesting. Yeah, a lot of people have debated
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:44.880]  whether they want to actually replace humans with robots or whether they want to essentially
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:50.160]  turn us into robots with mind control. There's been a lot of research from DARPA in both areas.
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:56.720]  So the thing that concerns me as an engineer is as I look at this technology, as Alex had
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:01.360]  pointed out, they always put backdoors into everything. They give us technology with useful
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:06.480]  hooks in it, things that we can use in our life that we see all the time in our smartphones.
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:12.000]  And yet at the same time, they turn it into a tracking device. They turn it into a listening
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.280]  device in terms of espionage. And so they have multiple agendas for all these things.
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:22.720]  That's what really concerns me. Technology is like any other tool. It can be used for good
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:29.040]  or it can be used for evil. And yet increasingly, we see the military industrial complex and the
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:34.960]  research departments as Eisenhower warned us in his famous military industrial complex speech.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:39.760]  He warned us not only about the military industrial complex, but about the research
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:44.160]  that was going to be driving that, saying that our government with its
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:51.360]  grants and research funding would essentially take over research and turn it into things that
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:56.480]  are always focused on the darkest, most evil side. That's the thing that really concerns me.
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:00.080]  Let's go to Greg in Bakersville. Greg?
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:09.520]  I'm gonna go for Megan. Hey, thanks a lot. Sure. Go ahead. Hey, you know the act of 1871?
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.760]  No, go ahead. Tell us about it. Oh, well, let me just kind of, we don't have enough time. Okay.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:22.160]  Well, just summarize it quickly for the audience. Yeah. You know what? If you really want, if you
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:32.800]  want to read the whole document, this guy tattooed 1009 has it. Yeah. 1009.com has it on his channel.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:39.840]  Thanks. Like 24 pages or something like that. All right. And basically what happened, you know,
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:44.720]  after the Civil War, we were hurt for money. Sorry, Greg. We're out of time. People go to
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:49.040]  take a look at that link. Tomorrow, Alex is going to be back with Dinesh D'Souza, 11th Central. Join
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:54.640]  us then. Sorry, Greg. A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:58.960]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:02.560]  What are the health effects of having these drugs and our drinking water?
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:06.160]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents. My friends,
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:10.560]  water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:14.960]  the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water. On average, the county said it sprays with
