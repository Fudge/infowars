[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:35.240]  Texas Alex Jones well I turned on MSNBC and morning Joe for like 30 seconds as
[00:35.240 --> 00:40.120]  I was scrolling through channels while on the elliptical and I saw Mika
[00:40.120 --> 00:45.840]  Brzezinski the daughter of a hardcore global war criminal blaming the Second
[00:45.840 --> 00:50.120]  Amendment for terror attacks and saying white men are the problem that clips
[00:50.120 --> 00:54.720]  coming up today that's just some of what we've got here it is so crazy how much
[00:54.720 --> 00:58.920]  the globalists hate this country a Star Wars matches us box office record
[00:58.920 --> 01:02.400]  probably one of the worst movies ever made I'll give you the review of that
[01:02.400 --> 01:08.800]  we'll get into a bunch of people run over by a car in Las Vegas will they call
[01:08.800 --> 01:12.800]  for banning cars probably that is people driving their own cars that's where all
[01:12.800 --> 01:18.600]  this is going huge geopolitical news huge election news huge Trump news is
[01:18.600 --> 01:23.640]  Obama plays the race card on him it is just crazy and now the federal
[01:23.640 --> 01:26.400]  government's come out and basically admitted that they are geoengineering
[01:26.400 --> 01:31.280]  covertly it's all coming up first a powerful report from John Bowne on the
[01:31.280 --> 01:36.920]  social engineering a transgender father who abandoned his seven children to
[01:36.920 --> 01:41.880]  start a new life as a six-year-old girl beautiful woman celebrated by some
[01:41.880 --> 01:47.120]  liberals as a shining example of diversity from Johnny Washed is being
[01:47.120 --> 01:52.840]  profiled by numerous media outlets after she Zee revealed her story in a video
[01:52.840 --> 01:58.040]  interview for the transgender project I can't deny I was married I can't deny
[01:58.040 --> 02:04.280]  I have children but I move forward now and I've gone back to Frankenstein I don't
[02:04.280 --> 02:09.120]  want to be an adult right now and I just live my life like I couldn't and
[02:09.120 --> 02:13.320]  everyone has to pay for you have a mummy and daddy a adopted mummy and daddy
[02:13.320 --> 02:19.400]  how nice me being a little girl Walsh does now dressing up and pretending to
[02:19.400 --> 02:23.440]  be a six-year-old girl point is why are they forced family after being given an
[02:23.440 --> 02:29.720]  ultimatum by her ex-wife who said she had to stop being trans or leave Walsh
[02:29.720 --> 02:34.800]  chose to abandon the 23-year marriage along with her seven kids and is now
[02:34.800 --> 02:39.960]  fulfilling her role as little sister to her new parents youngest granddaughter
[02:39.960 --> 02:46.640]  the clip has received well over 160,000 views but feedback is overwhelmingly
[02:46.640 --> 02:51.560]  negative while comments have been completely disabled several liberals
[02:51.560 --> 02:57.120]  reacted by expressing support for Walsh and celebrating her story Walsh
[02:57.120 --> 03:02.400]  herself reacted to critics by vowing to take on haters face-to-face at a
[03:02.400 --> 03:06.520]  location in Toronto however the vast majority of respondents to the
[03:06.520 --> 03:11.480]  independent article had a very different opinion one writes oh it's so great
[03:11.480 --> 03:16.800]  what a hero how brave fawn fawn this is what happens when lunacy is championed
[03:16.800 --> 03:21.760]  by the right on this is not news added another this is a mentally ill person
[03:21.760 --> 03:24.680]  who does not need pandering wait a minute trying to win your eyes just not
[03:24.680 --> 03:30.360]  cool another gay man accused Walsh to being an interloper and a fetishist one
[03:30.360 --> 03:35.000]  commenter also made a number of accusations against Walsh that if true
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.960]  demolish her attempt at framing herself as a victim it's just people coming right
[03:39.960 --> 03:44.480]  what this report doesn't tell you is that this person was charged with assault
[03:44.480 --> 03:49.080]  and abuse of his wife and family they were awarded a restraining order against
[03:49.080 --> 03:52.680]  him he has also been convicted of harassment and threatening a neighbor
[03:52.680 --> 03:57.480]  and a peeping Tom also his arrangement really new mummy and daddy it's like a
[03:57.480 --> 04:02.200]  super happy way to it's also fascinating how many social justice warriors and
[04:02.200 --> 04:07.440]  feminists who would normally crucify a man for abandoning his wife and kids are
[04:07.440 --> 04:12.120]  extremely supportive of Walsh simply because she now professes to be a
[04:12.120 --> 04:17.560]  six-year-old girl all kidding in paranoid transphobia aside isn't this just
[04:17.560 --> 04:22.760]  sheer unabashed propaganda aimed at destroying the family horse next maybe
[04:22.760 --> 04:28.640]  the outspoken mentally ill or excuse me modern-day left-wing liberals will be
[04:28.640 --> 04:34.440]  glorifying the sad tale of Johnny List a man who literally destroyed his family
[04:34.440 --> 04:39.400]  by patiently murdering them all because he had become recently unemployed and
[04:39.400 --> 04:44.760]  didn't want them to carry his burden rest assured deadbeat dads everywhere all
[04:44.760 --> 04:49.500]  you have to do is become a twisted paragon of perversion and the left
[04:49.500 --> 04:55.040]  wing will carry you to victory John bound for in force dot com that's right
[04:55.040 --> 05:00.360]  once men are destroyed it's all over thanks to the Federal Reserve system
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.240]  America's economy is in a terminal decline and according to economic expert
[05:04.240 --> 05:07.600]  Michael Snyder here's eight facts that reveal just how bad the economy really

[08:20.560 --> 08:26.680]  rang and former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura was giving me a call and I
[08:26.680 --> 08:29.720]  hadn't followed the news I didn't know that he'd gone to Russia a few weeks ago
[08:29.720 --> 08:34.920]  and just gotten back and he was talking about how much freer Russia had become
[08:34.920 --> 08:38.800]  versus how much liberty the United States has lost and he was talking about how
[08:38.800 --> 08:41.720]  he was at a press dinner with Vladimir Putin and I said did you meet Putin he
[08:41.720 --> 08:46.600]  said yes and they started to tell me some of the story pretty interesting so
[08:46.600 --> 08:51.640]  Jesse Ventura will be joining us in the second hour we'll talk election 2016
[08:51.640 --> 08:56.400]  also take some of your phone calls and you know I understand that the media
[08:56.400 --> 09:00.360]  polarized things where you're either for Jesse Ventura you're against him with
[09:00.360 --> 09:04.120]  the whole Chris Kyle story and I can see that a lot of people would see Chris
[09:04.120 --> 09:10.800]  Kyle as an admirable character especially once that movie came out but all
[09:10.800 --> 09:16.240]  of that separately from reality a jury found that it was not true because the
[09:16.240 --> 09:19.560]  story got changed over and over again I know Jesse Ventura good say what you
[09:19.560 --> 09:22.960]  want about him he would not go into a Navy seal bar that he'd gone to for
[09:22.960 --> 09:27.440]  decades when he was at a commencement speech and Sam glad seals are dying that
[09:27.440 --> 09:31.360]  just didn't happen and I believe Chris Kyle was manipulated into adding that to
[09:31.360 --> 09:36.960]  his book by news core to politically assassinate Jesse Ventura that said
[09:36.960 --> 09:40.240]  since he's been attacked by the right wing Ventura has moved more to the left
[09:40.240 --> 09:47.760]  and I don't like it I don't like it but I know Ventura well he's for real behind
[09:47.760 --> 09:51.520]  the scenes he is what you get on air so just like Donald Trump isn't perfect I
[09:51.520 --> 09:56.160]  like him because he's real that's what you get in public it's what you get in
[09:56.160 --> 10:01.880]  private he's not fake now you know I love Ron Paul I mean he's exactly what
[10:01.880 --> 10:06.760]  you see behind the scenes what you see on television or radio and I happen to
[10:06.760 --> 10:12.480]  agree with his politics about 99% of the time but there aren't many Ron Paul's
[10:12.480 --> 10:16.280]  out there are there so I'll take a Donald Trump or a Jesse Ventura any day
[10:16.280 --> 10:19.880]  over somebody like Hillary Clinton who got up during the debate that she showed
[10:19.880 --> 10:25.880]  up late for as an act of disrespect for everyone and began to lie about films
[10:25.880 --> 10:32.640]  that Isis is using of Donald Trump to recruit and of course Fox News CNN MSNBC
[10:32.640 --> 10:35.480]  everybody ran out to find it they've been looking for it for weeks because
[10:35.480 --> 10:38.880]  that's been a talking point that he's helping Isis and there is no such video
[10:38.880 --> 10:43.800]  and now she's been caught and the White House Press Secretary admits they can't
[10:43.800 --> 10:50.240]  find it they can't find where Trump did this
[10:51.280 --> 10:54.720]  now we learn Hillary Clinton missed debate because she wouldn't share a
[10:54.720 --> 10:58.840]  bathroom yeah that's how ultra mega elite she is she had to make them all
[10:58.840 --> 11:03.120]  wait till they cordoned off an area for her you don't look Hillary Clinton in
[11:03.120 --> 11:09.440]  the eyes when you are a waitress or a server this is the the the arrogance you
[11:09.440 --> 11:15.280]  don't get a tip when she's at a private restaurant she routinely calls managers
[11:15.280 --> 11:19.880]  over and tells people you get rid of that person or we're gonna give you some
[11:19.880 --> 11:26.160]  problems I mean she's the ultimate witch the ultimate narcissist you tell a
[11:26.160 --> 11:30.200]  narcissist you know a confident person the media will call a narcissist an
[11:30.200 --> 11:34.840]  aggressive person no that's somebody that's dominant but a true narcissist has
[11:34.840 --> 11:38.200]  all those traits but then only cares about themselves and and treat service
[11:38.200 --> 11:42.640]  staff and people really bad consistently you don't get bonuses working for
[11:42.640 --> 11:52.440]  Hillary Clinton unless you're her girlfriend but continuing on Trump
[11:52.440 --> 11:57.040]  last outed her and called her a big liar we're gonna be going over some of that
[11:57.040 --> 12:02.960]  today also Star Wars smashes US box office record and we're not gonna cover
[12:02.960 --> 12:08.080]  Star Wars because it's a big pop cultured event we're gonna cover it because
[12:08.080 --> 12:13.720]  understanding Star Wars and and how they've turned these media film
[12:13.720 --> 12:18.760]  spectacles into events not stories is understanding how they're dumbing down
[12:18.760 --> 12:21.600]  the culture you don't just think they're gonna put fluoride in the water to
[12:21.600 --> 12:26.400]  dumb us down or PSGMO or have heavy metals in the water system to dumb us
[12:26.400 --> 12:30.440]  down as eco science wide-out science are admits not gonna stop there they're
[12:30.440 --> 12:33.440]  gonna dumb the music down they're gonna dumb the writing down they're gonna
[12:33.440 --> 12:36.760]  dumb the literature down they're gonna dumb the attention span down they are
[12:36.760 --> 12:40.520]  going to literally rewire how our brains work with the flicker rates with the
[12:40.520 --> 12:45.440]  televisions on record that's all admitted plunging IQs neurological death
[12:45.440 --> 12:48.960]  in the brain Alzheimer's link to television viewing it's all there look
[12:48.960 --> 12:54.640]  it up yourself but I had dinner last night with a prominent producer and
[12:54.640 --> 13:00.080]  director who was in town just for a few days and he called me Saturday and he
[13:00.080 --> 13:03.840]  said you want to get dinner Sunday so I went by met him for two hours and had
[13:03.840 --> 13:10.080]  dinner and and he's been on the show before years ago I just didn't even say
[13:10.080 --> 13:12.840]  that but there's been quite a few directors on and he said you know what
[13:12.840 --> 13:16.760]  the way the country is now just don't use my name and I said well I don't want
[13:16.760 --> 13:20.320]  to plagiarize everything you just said and say I came up with it and he goes
[13:20.320 --> 13:24.040]  okay well you can say somebody in the media told you this or somebody in
[13:24.040 --> 13:27.720]  Hollywood but just don't say my name that's this this country this this world
[13:27.720 --> 13:32.440]  is just too out of control at this point I don't think you're gonna save it and he
[13:32.440 --> 13:36.640]  just laid out how it works in Hollywood and I already knew this but hearing it
[13:36.640 --> 13:42.160]  from him I mean I sat there for like an hour and a half he just laid it all out
[13:42.160 --> 13:46.960]  about they don't want stories they don't want complex things they don't want
[13:46.960 --> 13:50.520]  beautiful art even though it would be successful they want dumbed down
[13:50.520 --> 13:56.120]  spectacles where people think it's part of an event because millennials have been
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.400]  programmed and this guy's consulted the top technology companies he was talking
[14:00.400 --> 14:04.040]  about how technology companies really run everything it is an agenda to basically
[14:04.040 --> 14:08.360]  end humans and how they tell you you know you will produce something that's
[14:08.360 --> 14:13.160]  dumb and stupid and mindless that doesn't make sense on purpose to change
[14:13.160 --> 14:18.080]  the culture and I was like you gotta come on the year and I sort of trying to
[14:18.080 --> 14:22.440]  record him while he was talking I said can I record this he said no and he just
[14:22.440 --> 14:26.800]  kept spewing the info it was like when drudge was in here spilling his guts a
[14:26.800 --> 14:29.920]  month and a half ago I mean I shouldn't even have interrupted I mean I was
[14:29.920 --> 14:33.680]  somewhat controlled but he was just just just just spewing you know inside
[14:33.680 --> 14:40.040]  intel and key information like old faithful or something going off and it
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.560]  was the same thing last night I mean it was just unbelievable and of course he
[14:44.560 --> 14:47.880]  meets and hangs out with all the other top people and he was just telling me
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.840]  all this inside stuff and I was just oh please let me tell them oh please he
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.040]  said look you can go tell them just don't use specific names of me or the
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.160]  other people and it's very fatalist up there they know there's a technological
[15:03.160 --> 15:07.920]  technocracy takeover they know there's a plan to face people out they know it's
[15:07.920 --> 15:11.160]  a plan to ruin everybody's brains and they just tell the top directors you
[15:11.160 --> 15:18.680]  will do this or you're not gonna have a job they tell the writers that so when
[15:18.680 --> 15:25.920]  you see skillful screwed up bizarre suspended disbelief none of it makes
[15:25.920 --> 15:33.160]  sense it's all just juxtaposed helter-skelter oxymoronic but still all
[15:33.160 --> 15:39.760]  glitzy and shiny with emotional memes of like we are strong together or it was
[15:39.760 --> 15:43.400]  just cut to some thematic music and some woman's hair blowing for a minute and
[15:43.400 --> 15:48.440]  you know some male archetype model standing strong and then you're given
[15:48.440 --> 15:52.200]  that 10 seconds of wholesomeness and then it goes right back into the middle
[15:52.200 --> 15:59.400]  of illness and he was just describing how it's the triumph of the murder of
[15:59.400 --> 16:04.600]  beauty and the murder of intelligence and the murder of complexity because they
[16:04.600 --> 16:07.440]  don't want the public thinking like that and of course I was gonna say later
[16:07.440 --> 16:12.040]  that I was gonna get into this I kind of just did I never really plant hooks and
[16:12.040 --> 16:14.840]  then you know later get to it I just keep moving through all the incredible
[16:14.840 --> 16:18.880]  information but later in the third hour I need to write some notes off what he
[16:18.880 --> 16:24.720]  said I meant to do it last night when I got home but I was so tired but it was
[16:24.720 --> 16:28.440]  just it just gave me a headache actually at the same time because I already know
[16:28.440 --> 16:32.640]  all this but to hear it from him and to confirm it all and just to have him
[16:32.640 --> 16:42.760]  spill his guts about it was amazing it was truly amazing you go see grown men
[16:42.760 --> 16:46.400]  at like the new Avengers movie I wouldn't saw that a year ago and it was so
[16:46.400 --> 16:51.560]  bad it was it was perfect it was it was bad on purpose these are really good
[16:51.560 --> 16:55.240]  writers really good directors who just go you want to be horrible and dumb down
[16:55.240 --> 16:58.520]  you bet I'll make it the most horrible stupid thing ever and they actually go
[16:58.520 --> 17:03.640]  in and make jokes about what they're doing and they all just just like vomit
[17:03.640 --> 17:07.800]  on each other basically I mean I mean it's it's they're not even into it it's
[17:07.800 --> 17:13.360]  like all just sick and horrible and evil but they do it because they want to be
[17:13.360 --> 17:20.840]  part of this great evil and so that's what something like Star Wars is and it's
[17:20.840 --> 17:24.480]  such a spectacle under peer pressure that everybody goes and then just goes
[17:24.480 --> 17:29.400]  I was there it doesn't matter and then you just per take in the bad acting and
[17:29.400 --> 17:31.760]  none of it making sense and all of it being stupid and all that being
[17:31.760 --> 17:37.840]  emptiness as a vehicle to sell coffee creamers and toys and towels and
[17:37.840 --> 17:43.000]  clothing and it becomes your culture emptiness and fake and devoid of
[17:43.000 --> 17:49.480]  anything real and that's only at this phase you see when Melissa Harris Perry
[17:49.480 --> 17:56.280]  gets up there and says Darth Vader is racist because he's black and then she
[17:56.280 --> 18:00.320]  acts all emotional and says it hurts me that's to hurt her viewers so they get
[18:00.320 --> 18:05.080]  upset and hurt when they see Darth Vader so they're in a mentally ill prison of
[18:05.080 --> 18:11.080]  racist everyone's out to get me total chip on the shoulder world and so if you
[18:11.080 --> 18:14.800]  watch her everything is attached to it no one else is allowed to work hard that
[18:14.800 --> 18:21.280]  puts down black slaves you can't say a father was good because that takes away
[18:21.280 --> 18:26.680]  from women see no one can achieve in this no one can be successful except the
[18:26.680 --> 18:31.480]  anointed priesthood they're allowed to talk they're allowed to tell you which
[18:31.480 --> 18:35.240]  words to use and you look at you realize these people study this
[18:35.240 --> 18:39.160]  scientifically and sit there with a playbook trying to make all of their
[18:39.160 --> 18:43.200]  language weaponized to create an artificial reality to absolutely
[18:43.200 --> 18:48.400]  devastate the minds of the poor drooling victims that watch it they are
[18:48.400 --> 18:53.800]  creating mass mental illness by design and then even parts of the left see it
[18:53.800 --> 18:57.240]  like in that Atlantic Monthly article last month admitting the coddling of
[18:57.240 --> 19:01.120]  America and saying that adults now are like gibbering mentally ill children
[19:01.120 --> 19:04.560]  afraid of everything that's the point it's meant to make you afraid of knowledge
[19:04.560 --> 19:08.800]  afraid of culture afraid of literature where you can't read anything without
[19:08.800 --> 19:13.960]  getting upset and you walk into your college campus you go it's called Lynch
[19:13.960 --> 19:19.480]  Hall they want to lynch me and the Attorney General says yes we'll look
[19:19.480 --> 19:25.800]  into Lynch Hall even though she's named Lynch see but oh she's black she can be
[19:25.800 --> 19:32.200]  called Lynch now I mean this is just just scientific folks and you talk to
[19:32.200 --> 19:35.440]  somebody in Hollywood I've known for years they go oh yeah now it's just
[19:35.440 --> 19:39.800]  unspoken now it's just official this is what you do if you want to make hundreds
[19:39.800 --> 19:43.000]  of millions of dollars never movies produced and put out is you just wreck
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.000]  everything and create the ugliest stupidest shallowest pipe vehicle you
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.840]  can and he says and they laugh they go it doesn't matter once we got your ticket

[24:33.880 --> 24:38.480]  and to not want to enjoy a movie but to enjoy the spectacle of being part of it
[24:38.480 --> 24:42.800]  and then talking to others about it in the false culture so we've replaced

[24:57.760 --> 25:03.040]  like this that are totally empty and I've got probably seven or eight articles
[25:03.040 --> 25:08.880]  in the stack today where Harvard hands out manuals and put signs up saying
[25:08.880 --> 25:13.040]  don't use these words this is how you door are to speak and they even get down
[25:13.040 --> 25:16.000]  to you know don't have Halloween parties and you're like oh it's to be
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.920]  sensitive no it's to have a culture of total oppression about what you say and
[25:19.920 --> 25:24.480]  do the opposite of what a university is the opposite of Renaissance and
[25:24.480 --> 25:30.480]  universities founded in the last 500 years in Europe and the last 350 here
[25:30.480 --> 25:36.320]  in North America they are killing culture open culture right now they're
[25:36.320 --> 25:43.120]  killing liberalism and it's quote liberals with their hijabs and their
[25:43.120 --> 25:49.240]  little outfits up there on MSNBC every day telling you what reality is as they
[25:49.240 --> 25:57.120]  slaughter freedom right in front of you I mean it's so sick and I've got this new
[25:57.120 --> 26:04.280]  article Ohio College students offended by culturally appropriated food at
[26:04.280 --> 26:08.080]  dining halls now this is where the mental illness goes into the stratosphere
[26:08.080 --> 26:12.960]  Washington Times students at liberal Ohio colleges are voicing outrage over
[26:12.960 --> 26:17.440]  fried chicken sushi general chose chicken Vietnamese sandwiches serve the
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.400]  school cafeteria saying the cheap knockoff dishes are insensitive and
[26:21.400 --> 26:25.280]  culturally inappropriate so it's okay for the federal government to feed
[26:25.280 --> 26:33.640]  people prison level food to our young children in big scams full of GMOs full
[26:33.640 --> 26:39.320]  of additives as long as it's low calorie it's supposedly okay but then these
[26:39.320 --> 26:43.920]  colleges try to have you know pizza and Italian food one day Asian cuisine
[26:43.920 --> 26:47.680]  another seafood another that's just how you have good variety that's what you
[26:47.680 --> 26:52.280]  want at a good college let's see they don't know how to learn or how to read
[26:52.280 --> 26:56.160]  or write or how to get jobs or how to be charming or how to save money or how
[26:56.160 --> 27:02.160]  to start a business they learn how to see phantoms phantom menaces everywhere
[27:02.160 --> 27:09.240]  and that's how you're creative Lynch Hall I think that was in Ohio too oh my
[27:09.240 --> 27:13.560]  gosh Chinese food how horrible because you know when you go eat Chinese food it's
[27:13.560 --> 27:17.120]  racist I told you the story when I was at Martin Springs about two years ago my
[27:17.120 --> 27:20.960]  kids we're all laying out in the sun been swimming in the big natural pool and
[27:20.960 --> 27:26.480]  I see two Hispanics and a white guy college student age they're one man I'm
[27:26.480 --> 27:29.520]  so stoned yeah yeah it's really fun they look all you've been smoking weed or
[27:29.520 --> 27:32.920]  something they're jumping up down the water they go man I'm hungry I want some
[27:32.920 --> 27:36.680]  Chinese food I was one of the Mexicans one of the Hispanics and the white guy
[27:36.680 --> 27:40.440]  in the Hispanic go oh don't say that it's racist and they actually meant it got
[27:40.440 --> 27:44.640]  all scared they have no language they have no culture guaranteed they were
[27:44.640 --> 27:48.840]  modern you know Marvel comic fans I'm not knocking Marvel comic fans I'm just
[27:48.840 --> 27:52.200]  saying it's that archetype you go to these movies you take your kids to it
[27:52.200 --> 27:55.480]  there's like grown men sometimes look like six foot four like they could you
[27:55.480 --> 27:59.400]  know kill you with their one the hit they're like one oh awesome oh iron man
[27:59.400 --> 28:07.280]  oh and it's so cheesy so stupid so unrealistic so unmale so fraudulent and
[28:07.280 --> 28:17.800]  this is their manhood is some fantasy land and so talk about a prison it's in
[28:17.800 --> 28:21.640]  the news all the time where people will say hey I'd like a Negro modello people
[28:21.640 --> 28:25.840]  we got a problem call me a the n-word no man this means black in Spanish just
[28:25.840 --> 28:29.760]  getting a beer but so they're talking about even on menus changing stuff like
[28:29.760 --> 28:33.800]  that because actually in Europe they are because it's just insane I mean there's
[28:33.800 --> 28:38.000]  lots of birds named Negro in Europe that just means blackbird and all over
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.520]  Europe they're changing the names of birds that have the word Negro in it
[28:41.520 --> 28:47.800]  that's Latin folks goes back to the Romans means black the change in it it's a
[28:47.800 --> 28:51.320]  triumph of ignorance it's the end of the population this is what Orwell talked
[28:51.320 --> 28:53.800]  about getting into a point with a dumb down population where the words have
[28:53.800 --> 28:56.760]  all been reduced down to nothing and it's a crime to use certain words to where
[28:56.760 --> 29:02.320]  no one can even communicate and so in just a few years a college graduate
[29:02.320 --> 29:06.280]  hearing this show won't understand it or will be in so much pain hearing the
[29:06.280 --> 29:09.920]  words because all they're designed to do is scan for thought crime that they
[29:09.920 --> 29:13.040]  will become physically ill and run away you know gibbering that basically already
[29:13.040 --> 29:18.280]  happens but isn't that fitting because just like you go buy a Star Wars ticket
[29:18.280 --> 29:21.560]  and it doesn't matter if it's horribly done you're gonna believe it was good
[29:21.560 --> 29:25.000]  because you just spent 10 bucks for the ticket they already got your money you've
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.680]  been conned you're in the Nigerian scam now you're not gonna admit you got con
[29:28.680 --> 29:31.840]  for five grand you'll go in 20 grand before you finally wake up or maybe
[29:31.840 --> 29:36.600]  never just like the college bubbles close to 90% of people will never get
[29:36.600 --> 29:39.480]  their money back with a college degree and it's getting worse but that doesn't
[29:39.480 --> 29:43.040]  matter they're already in the scam their arms already in the woodchipper they're
[29:43.040 --> 29:46.680]  gonna go in headfirst feed their family everybody into it because they can't
[29:46.680 --> 29:53.160]  admit they got chump we're on the March the Empire is coming up Alex Jones and
[29:53.160 --> 30:01.280]  the GCN radio network the Syrian refugee admitted his main goal is not to
[30:01.280 --> 30:06.000]  escape war or ISIS persecution but to convert Europeans to Islam he said quote
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  my main goal for leaving to Syria is to lead the people to the acceptance of
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.640]  Islam I swear by a lot that I only came here for this one goal I have observed
[30:14.640 --> 30:18.240]  that they are curious and willing to get to know Islam through us and he's not
[30:18.240 --> 30:21.080]  the only one influential she had recently gave a speech in which she
[30:21.080 --> 30:24.600]  encouraged radical Muslims to use the migrant crisis to quote breed with
[30:24.600 --> 30:28.520]  Europeans and conquer their countries but this modern-day Islamic conquest is
[30:28.520 --> 30:32.200]  not just happening only in Europe during the US radical Muslims are building
[30:32.200 --> 30:35.200]  their own Islamic compounds and communities while telling Christians
[30:35.200 --> 30:38.960]  and other non-Muslims to keep out and these communities are rapidly expanding
[30:38.960 --> 30:42.680]  in fact the Obama administration has admitted nearly 400 Syrian refugees
[30:42.680 --> 30:46.720]  into the US and see November 13th Paris attacks and only one of them is a
[30:46.720 --> 30:50.680]  Christian but Christians comprise about 10% of the population in Syria so why
[30:50.680 --> 30:54.560]  isn't the Obama administration allowing more Christian refugees into the US I'll

[34:33.720 --> 34:39.480]  like this this fast I mean this is South Park quality ridiculousness but we did
[34:39.480 --> 34:46.400]  it in a couple hours so great job Rob do and Josh Owens and of course Michael
[34:46.400 --> 34:49.680]  Zimmerman and the others Darren McBree and they all just pulled in on it and
[34:49.680 --> 34:53.760]  put it together it's pretty funny but it doesn't translate too well on radio so

[34:58.040 --> 35:04.160]  hijack empty solace rotten festering enemy torpedoes that are the new Star

[35:33.720 --> 35:36.840]  the serious news then we're gonna go to break and I'm just gonna do it that
[35:36.840 --> 35:41.720]  little six-minute segment at the end of the hour the federal government itself
[35:41.720 --> 35:47.640]  is now coming out on basically a weekly basis and admitting that they're geo
[35:47.640 --> 35:51.960]  engineering people because we have exposed them you have exposed them
[35:51.960 --> 35:58.040]  they're now preparing to bring this main line and admit that they are spraying
[35:58.040 --> 36:07.200]  barium salts aluminum dioxide and radioactive isotopes as well on the population so
[36:07.200 --> 36:13.720]  they're now admitting it it's in the Smithsonian dot gov it is the Department
[36:13.720 --> 36:21.800]  of Energy it's all being announced and of course they're saying it's not ice
[36:21.800 --> 36:27.600]  condensation crystals it's not ice condensation crystals and we never said
[36:27.600 --> 36:33.360]  it was and there's real condensation trails out there it's what's been added
[36:33.360 --> 36:39.280]  to the jet fuel oh impurities in the jet fuel are creating nuclei and changing
[36:39.280 --> 36:44.080]  our atmosphere and making the earth up to 30% darker oh where's all the
[36:44.080 --> 36:49.880]  apologies from the people from CNN to MSNBC to you name it on every channel
[36:49.880 --> 37:00.560]  you can imagine making fun of us for chemtrails I mean it's been public the
[37:00.560 --> 37:05.600]  high-altitude aerosol geo engineering programs since the early 1990s they just
[37:05.600 --> 37:10.080]  don't call it chemtrails again it's like people go where's the FEMA camp it
[37:10.080 --> 37:15.000]  isn't called FEMA camp no this army base is just designated an emergency
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.160]  centers establishment system for political dissidents here's the army dot
[37:19.160 --> 37:24.080]  mill document I mean just type in army admits reeducation camps they use the
[37:24.080 --> 37:30.680]  word reeducation camps but see oh we people were calling it FEMA camps oh
[37:30.680 --> 37:35.600]  there's nobody here by that name that's how they play lawyer games with
[37:35.600 --> 37:43.080]  everybody and now the Smithsonian comes out goes oh airplane exhaust is causing
[37:43.080 --> 37:47.400]  geo engineering lingering clouds and cloud banks that are changing the
[37:47.400 --> 37:54.440]  atmosphere exactly what we said in 1996 exactly I started making a film about
[37:54.440 --> 37:59.080]  condensation trails and chemtrails what was really going on it's titled dark
[37:59.080 --> 38:04.360]  skies before they had a movie called that and there was so much evidence that I
[38:04.360 --> 38:09.880]  got bogged down in the hundreds of patents and admissions and air bases and
[38:09.880 --> 38:13.560]  and Department of Energy and all their own videos of them with the chemtrail
[38:13.560 --> 38:16.760]  sprayers because they've got special planes that do intense chemtrailing but
[38:16.760 --> 38:20.280]  then they've got to add to the jet fuel of general aviation and also commercial
[38:20.280 --> 38:23.920]  aviation where it just distributes it but some third world countries don't take
[38:23.920 --> 38:28.320]  part in it that's how you'll see a big jet the same level as another jet 33,000
[38:28.320 --> 38:32.200]  feet putting nothing out and right by it just stuff dumping out of the American
[38:32.200 --> 38:36.600]  Airlines plane because all there's a whole bunch of countries that participate
[38:36.600 --> 38:43.960]  and then it's added at the jet fuel production refineries and if you look
[38:43.960 --> 38:48.040]  there's only four or five companies in North America that are refining jet fuel
[38:48.040 --> 38:51.760]  on a mass scale and all you got to do is have them be part of the industrial
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.720]  infra guard program and baby you give them a tax exemption to mix it this way
[38:56.720 --> 39:05.680]  and it's classified and they do it and we've got all the documents on that can
[39:05.680 --> 39:09.520]  you imagine what else is going on when they're jacking with the atmosphere and
[39:09.520 --> 39:14.840]  won't tell us what they're doing can you imagine what's what's what's piggyback
[39:14.840 --> 39:19.320]  and what's Trojan horse into all the GMO and the vaccines I mean just what we
[39:19.320 --> 39:24.680]  know is enough to devastate human life on this planet forever I mean just type
[39:24.680 --> 39:30.280]  in chemtrails from space and just look at the world or look at the BBC a decade
[39:30.280 --> 39:36.160]  ago earth 20% darker now it's 30% darker oh but nothing's going on there's no
[39:36.160 --> 39:43.240]  world government there's nothing secret everything's fine yeah they feed round
[39:43.240 --> 39:47.320]  up ready soybeans to guinea pigs and the first generation dies in about half
[39:47.320 --> 39:52.680]  the age they should the next generation about 60 70% are infertile and have
[39:52.680 --> 39:56.120]  tumors all over their bodies but it's not to the third generation you get
[39:56.120 --> 40:00.800]  almost 99% infertility and almost every guinea pig is horribly deformed with
[40:00.800 --> 40:05.440]  their testicles on top of their heads I told Howard Stern that he laughed about
[40:05.440 --> 40:14.680]  it it's funny I know until your kids get it and then it's time to die it's all a
[40:14.680 --> 40:18.360]  covert program and you know I've gone kind of crazy knowing about it every day
[40:18.360 --> 40:21.160]  having to live with it watch everybody else just go about their business and
[40:21.160 --> 40:24.520]  then I'll be at some event or out having a good time all sudden I feel feel guilty
[40:24.520 --> 40:28.960]  I'll be out having a good time laughing with buddies or you know doing a podcast
[40:28.960 --> 40:34.300]  or something I went over to on it Joe Rogan's outfit Aubrey Marcus's outfit
[40:34.300 --> 40:37.240]  filing this week had a great time I'm sitting there Saturday night having a
[40:37.240 --> 40:41.320]  great time it just hit me I went wait a minute we're under attack I've got a
[40:41.320 --> 40:46.280]  sheet and I know it's unnatural for me to just be up here yelling and screaming
[40:46.280 --> 40:48.720]  they're murdering us they're murdering us all the time and then nothing's
[40:48.720 --> 40:52.520]  happening nothing's being done in an ancient civilization people go check
[40:52.520 --> 40:55.240]  into what I was saying believe it and stop it but because everybody just
[40:55.240 --> 41:00.880]  thinks you know transformers are real and the X-Men is the real world then I
[41:00.880 --> 41:05.200]  can't reach them they're gone they're busy battling windmills like Don
[41:05.200 --> 41:10.480]  Tehode you know how dare you feed me Chinese food on the menu that's racist
[41:10.480 --> 41:18.560]  you've stolen Asian culture and it's the white kid saying it of course and I'm
[41:18.560 --> 41:20.720]  like hey you know they put cancer viruses and almost all the major
[41:20.720 --> 41:25.040]  vaccines here's some documents shut up you racist okay uh they're spraying
[41:25.040 --> 41:28.520]  aluminum on us the trees and plants are dying the plankton's dying it's real
[41:28.520 --> 41:34.480]  dangerous here's a shut up racist listen they're abhorring half the black
[41:34.480 --> 41:36.880]  people it's a plan and they're gonna phase it into all groups we need to
[41:36.880 --> 41:40.720]  really work together shut up white devil
[41:44.160 --> 41:48.160]  all these people are now telling me did you know episode 3 is about 9-11 in
[41:48.160 --> 41:51.920]  false flags really thank you for telling me that I thought I broke that 10 years
[41:51.920 --> 41:57.400]  ago why is it no one listens to me when I'm saying it when it's breaking when
[41:57.400 --> 42:03.640]  it's happening instead all they do is misappropriate what I've said straw man
[42:03.640 --> 42:10.840]  we didn't have a moon landing never said that giant wasp live under the UN
[42:10.840 --> 42:15.800]  building never said that and that was in over people go what you said it was
[42:15.800 --> 42:20.440]  500 no it's over a thousand now as of last Monday it was 500 over a thousand
[42:20.440 --> 42:26.320]  articles last week alone saying that I believe that aliens run the planet that
[42:26.320 --> 42:29.880]  they're a giant wasp under the UN building and that Obama sends tornadoes
[42:29.880 --> 42:34.680]  to kill people never said any of that a lady said do you think the big tornado
[42:34.680 --> 42:38.440]  that Oklahoma City a few years ago was weather weapons and I said no they
[42:38.440 --> 42:42.240]  usually do it in big general fronts to like keep water out of areas or change
[42:42.240 --> 42:46.600]  atmospheres they don't tend to send tornadoes themselves though they admit
[42:46.600 --> 42:50.080]  they can go into weather systems and create tornadoes that turns into Obama
[42:50.080 --> 42:52.840]  sent the tornado and again I know I keep repeating that because when there's a
[42:52.840 --> 42:58.000]  thousand articles plus saying that I've got a counter it but I've had four or
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.400]  five people last week that I know on the street or in person so yeah I saw that
[43:02.400 --> 43:07.920]  in the paper Shane Steiner saw the local Austin American statesman he goes
[43:07.920 --> 43:11.560]  but I know you don't say that I've heard your show but see they know you as
[43:11.560 --> 43:15.920]  listeners know they're lying they're targeting new people inoculating them in
[43:15.920 --> 43:19.400]  their own terms psychologically inoculating them conditioning them
[43:19.400 --> 43:25.080]  preconditioning them to not listen when they hear me explain what's been added
[43:25.080 --> 43:29.000]  to the vaccines or the geoengineering is going on because they know I've got
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.040]  their plan I know who they are I know their master program because they're
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.640]  so arrogant and have written about it and if people listen to me it's game
[43:37.640 --> 43:41.240]  over for the New World Order but you've got to decide that you want to do
[43:41.240 --> 43:45.800]  something about this you've got to decide that you care about your family
[43:45.800 --> 43:49.920]  you've got to decide you don't want to just be overwritten I mean maybe you're
[43:49.920 --> 43:53.840]  so lazy and so mesmerized by TV and that's so much you know food and all
[43:53.840 --> 43:57.480]  these base level things you need they've done that on purpose that you don't
[43:57.480 --> 44:02.280]  realize you're being absolutely slow murdered those that the gods would
[44:02.280 --> 44:05.960]  destroy they would first make mad well the globalists are playing the part of
[44:05.960 --> 44:10.720]  God that's who they want to be that's who they're trying to be and so those
[44:10.720 --> 44:14.080]  they would destroy they would first make mad and you look at everything they're
[44:14.080 --> 44:18.760]  doing to us and our culture it's to make us insane and mentally ill so we don't
[44:18.760 --> 44:22.960]  stand up for ourselves you'd have to be crazy living in a freakish society like
[44:22.960 --> 44:29.200]  this to go along with it so they're gonna make you crazy and dumb and stupid
[44:30.760 --> 44:35.120]  I'll be honest with you 10 years ago I never thought it'd be the warrior clash
[44:35.120 --> 44:39.320]  that would listen to me I would bash the military I would bash the police all
[44:39.320 --> 44:44.280]  day because I knew they worked for the globalists that had taken over I would
[44:44.280 --> 44:47.720]  think I've got to warn the general proletariat to use their words so that
[44:47.720 --> 44:52.480]  we don't go along with this takeover but I didn't realize that for all the
[44:52.480 --> 44:55.200]  faults of the people that enter the warrior class they don't want to be
[44:55.200 --> 44:57.920]  slaves they don't want to be conquered they don't want to be driven into
[44:57.920 --> 45:02.280]  slavery they don't know no they want to do the hanging and it's that class now
[45:02.280 --> 45:07.120]  that's totally tuned to this show see I never expected those type of angles the
[45:07.120 --> 45:12.200]  globalists have a big problem because of that but I want to tell the general
[45:12.200 --> 45:16.240]  public something right now you better wake up to and get involved and get your
[45:16.240 --> 45:21.040]  butts in gear because you are being attacked you are being destroyed let's
[45:21.040 --> 45:26.880]  go to this next clip Mika Brzezinski who dates the former Republican
[45:26.880 --> 45:33.800]  congressman who had a dead intern found on him again when you watch these shows
[45:33.800 --> 45:37.400]  you know the background her father wrote a book bragging that he set up the
[45:37.400 --> 45:45.440]  Khmer Rouge who killed 35% of Cambodia's population roughly and he wrote in there
[45:45.440 --> 45:49.200]  that he's very proud of the fact that he didn't kill the people he set someone
[45:49.200 --> 45:53.340]  else to do it so that he is politically protected he brags about the
[45:53.340 --> 45:57.800]  English he puts on a ball when he when he knocks four or five balls that he
[45:57.800 --> 46:05.000]  calls into the corner pockets oh I didn't kill all those Cambodians I hit
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.640]  another ball hit another ball that knocked him in but I didn't touch the
[46:08.640 --> 46:13.160]  ball with the wrong ball and he writes a book you can go read his quotes oh real
[46:13.160 --> 46:18.200]  cutesy so see when you step there with a platinum blind with her with her
[46:18.200 --> 46:22.840]  disgraced congressman totally blackmailed and controlled she just looked see a
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.800]  map look at things through my I see look at look at things through knowledge and
[46:27.800 --> 46:32.120]  background then you see two enemies two enemy officers in front of you praying
[46:32.120 --> 46:37.640]  on America praying on your family and that's only one dimension of that could
[46:37.640 --> 46:47.880]  go into more the two are lovers in their hatred for humanity Scarborough talks
[46:47.880 --> 46:52.960]  about how he admires and learns so much from her father one of the most evil men
[46:52.960 --> 46:58.240]  alive today who has a public plan in the grand chess board to engineer thermal
[46:58.240 --> 47:01.320]  nuclear war with Russia
[47:02.440 --> 47:08.880]  how's that sound oh Darth Vader scary the new monsters in the Star Wars is
[47:08.880 --> 47:14.160]  scary how about the people that write books bragging about killing millions of
[47:14.160 --> 47:19.560]  innocent men women and children and brag about it you think they might be a
[47:19.560 --> 47:24.600]  little dangerous you think they might need to be met oh no who wants to
[47:24.600 --> 47:28.680]  actually fight with real monsters let's pretend we fight with monsters in our
[47:28.680 --> 47:36.040]  minds because we're little boys and then you can see through her eyes as she
[47:36.040 --> 47:41.640]  tries to show off with the latest White House talking points that how dare
[47:41.640 --> 47:49.080]  Santorum who's neocon in his own right so there's levels to this how dare Rick
[47:49.080 --> 47:54.000]  Santorum be worried about radical muzzles being brought into the country why
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.920]  we know the biggest killers are white men with guns really go to the FBI crime
[47:58.920 --> 48:06.080]  statistics do you know the lowest level of any major quote racial group in crime
[48:06.080 --> 48:12.880]  with firearms it's white males that's fact look it up you know overall crime
[48:12.880 --> 48:18.280]  with guns period from black to Hispanic to Asian to white is down since 1992 61

[50:50.840 --> 50:54.240]  the fact the founders laid down the Second Amendment as a checkmate against
[50:54.240 --> 50:59.080]  them they were so ready oh God bless George Washington thank you God for
[50:59.080 --> 51:04.320]  people like that they're the only ones from 240 years ago as the force field
[51:04.320 --> 51:07.680]  holding back some of this right now but it's weakening it's falling folks and
[51:07.680 --> 51:13.320]  all hell's gonna break loose thank God the what they built for us that's why
[51:13.320 --> 51:17.880]  the enemy hates them so much because they're fighting their spirit today just
[51:17.880 --> 51:21.240]  go back to this enemy I just cannot watch the daughter of a mass murdering
[51:21.240 --> 51:25.040]  war criminal who wants World War three on top of it involved the overthrow of
[51:25.040 --> 51:31.160]  Ukraine every other evil you can imagine with her evil evil evil co-host evil
[51:31.160 --> 51:37.240]  just praying on people and showing total anti-white racism here it is well why
[51:37.240 --> 51:43.120]  aren't you working on white men with guns I mean come on Rick Santorum you
[51:43.120 --> 51:48.400]  know better you're smart guy you're telling us all need to come out and
[51:48.400 --> 51:53.560]  talk about the tiny percentage of their community that has kind of quite
[51:53.560 --> 51:59.040]  frankly wreaked havoc but yet you look at the data of white men with guns
[51:59.040 --> 52:04.520]  wreaking havoc on this country again white men everything is scientifically
[52:04.520 --> 52:09.820]  trade white men all her body was what what man much as a passion of like a
[52:09.820 --> 52:18.120]  huntress with battle axes to hack up her enemy she's a white man the type that
[52:18.120 --> 52:24.240]  strangle people those type here let's oh you love it don't you the huntress to
[52:24.240 --> 52:28.480]  savage the enemy Americans to hold them down to tie them down she's a lila
[52:28.480 --> 52:34.880]  pulley with another rope over us help me tie them down help me hold them no we're
[52:34.880 --> 52:39.440]  breaking loose or you're a prostitute of the New World Order selling out the
[52:39.440 --> 52:44.720]  American people now let's go back to her here she is well why aren't you working
[52:44.720 --> 52:50.600]  on white men with guns I mean come on Rick Santorum you know better you're
[52:50.600 --> 52:55.120]  smart guy you're telling us again to the very start you know enough you're a
[52:55.120 --> 52:59.840]  smart guy everything is a literal CIA psych warfare technique one after the
[52:59.840 --> 53:03.200]  other she just bam bam bam like a video game hitting the button she was
[53:03.200 --> 53:08.560]  taught to hit oh she's actually scared she knows she has no ratings she knows
[53:08.560 --> 53:12.240]  she's a nobody she's scared of the evil in her family she could feel the darkness
[53:12.240 --> 53:15.960]  pulling at her so she wants to be more evil friends with the devil maybe he'll
[53:15.960 --> 53:23.400]  be nice to her oh he's gonna be nice to you you old hag your soul is so ugly I've
[53:23.400 --> 53:27.080]  seen 98 year old women more beautiful than you and not because they're
[53:27.080 --> 53:34.200]  physically beautiful you're an ugly hag ice cold ice queen you feel the fire of
[53:34.200 --> 53:39.920]  liberty it will burn your fraud to the ground you think your devil's got power
[53:39.920 --> 53:45.880]  that devil only tries to imitate aspects of God you are weak you will be
[53:45.880 --> 53:51.240]  broken now let's go back to the monster I'm not gonna interrupt at this time here
[53:51.240 --> 53:58.360]  she is well why aren't you working on white men with guns I mean come on Rick
[53:58.360 --> 54:03.680]  Santorum you know better you're smart guy you're telling us all need to come
[54:03.680 --> 54:09.320]  out and talk about the tiny percentage of their community that has kind of
[54:09.320 --> 54:15.080]  quite frankly wreaked havoc but yet you look at the data of white men with guns
[54:15.080 --> 54:19.520]  wreaking havoc on this country why aren't white men all coming I don't
[54:19.520 --> 54:23.600]  you call on them to do that I actually a lot of things I'm doing a lot of things
[54:23.600 --> 54:27.800]  about trying to solve gun gun violence and that and that primarily focuses on
[54:27.800 --> 54:31.760]  the family yeah I mean against people in the terror watch list out not being
[54:31.760 --> 54:35.080]  able to buy a gun if you if you look at if you look at the folks who are
[54:35.080 --> 54:39.600]  causing crime in America almost every single one of them and I think Chuck
[54:39.600 --> 54:43.840]  Colson put pointed this out that 85 to 90% of men in prison grew up without a
[54:43.840 --> 54:47.280]  father in the home so you want to get at the at the at the real-life problem here
[54:47.280 --> 54:51.520]  you've got a breakdown of society basically based upon the breakdown of
[54:51.520 --> 54:57.040]  the family to point to an inanimate object is Santorum is pointing to black
[54:57.040 --> 54:59.760]  crime rates being astronomical in areas where the families were broken up he
[54:59.760 --> 55:02.680]  didn't say black people that's the only way his argument has any similar to
[55:02.680 --> 55:06.560]  reality no the overall crime rates way down because of gun ownership going up
[55:06.560 --> 55:11.680]  and because of better policing techniques okay and everybody knows that in
[55:11.680 --> 55:14.640]  fact guys can you roll the feed with Justice Department numbers on the crime
[55:14.640 --> 55:19.240]  rate plunging I know we have that in the file in there for TV viewers but just
[55:19.240 --> 55:22.960]  type in gun crime plunges but perception is it's up you'll get LA Times
[55:22.960 --> 55:28.680]  Washington Post even they admit it but Santorum goes along with it goes well
[55:28.680 --> 55:35.320]  the crime rates up because of fatherless families no it's not no it's not no
[55:35.320 --> 55:40.600]  it's not it is not I'm showing FBI.gov statistics it's just absolute
[55:40.600 --> 55:46.280]  flaming baloney and folks people need to meet the Brazinski's with anger they
[55:46.280 --> 55:51.320]  need to meet all of these enemies of humanity point blank because these
[55:51.320 --> 55:54.040]  people have never had to have consequences for the way they behave the
[55:54.040 --> 55:57.840]  way they act the type of evil they pull really evil powerful people in history
[55:57.840 --> 56:02.480]  were pretty controlled about what they said and did because they understood how
[56:02.480 --> 56:04.880]  weak they really were even if they thought they were in a position of
[56:04.880 --> 56:12.320]  strength any given day they could roll those dice and come up snake eyes I've
[56:12.320 --> 56:15.320]  raised my rhetoric to the level of their outrageousness to get people out of
[56:15.320 --> 56:23.120]  comas but what I say and what I break down is accurate there it is done crime
[56:23.120 --> 56:29.000]  has plunged Americans think it's up study LA Times again but there they are
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.760]  just going along with yep well crimes up because the fathers what what it's just
[56:34.760 --> 56:38.480]  not of its true it's just bathing in ignorance but they're not bathing in
[56:38.480 --> 56:43.560]  ignorance more Americans view letting more people carrying concealed handguns
[56:43.560 --> 56:47.160]  is better solution of terrorism the stricter gun control new big pullout
[56:47.160 --> 56:53.760]  that's from Gallup the truth is we're winning they're angry and they have
[56:53.760 --> 56:58.720]  built admitted giant emergency center establishment systems and civilian
[56:58.720 --> 57:02.640]  inmate labor camp programs to prime them with the prisoners and it's all
[57:02.640 --> 57:06.640]  admitted you can read the Army manual on civil internment program for the
[57:06.640 --> 57:09.760]  United States it's about 30 something pages long you can all read about how
[57:09.760 --> 57:12.120]  the process you with your social security numbers that can we pull up the
[57:12.120 --> 57:15.000]  internment camp document just for new TV viewers and listeners I'll just give you
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  the U.S. Army document number if you want to go read it army dot mill for
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.520]  yourself oh I'm a conspiracy theorist oh sorry by the way I didn't get to the
[57:21.520 --> 57:24.640]  geoengineering I'll do it next hour after Ventura leaves us oh yes
[57:24.640 --> 57:28.800]  Smithsonian Associated Press popular science all just got the green light to
[57:28.800 --> 57:35.520]  come out and break the big news they'll probably get pulled with surprises that
[57:35.520 --> 57:39.800]  there's something in the jet fuel causing geoengineering and persistent jet
[57:39.800 --> 57:44.320]  trails oh those of us that made films about it talk forever we won't get
[57:44.320 --> 57:49.080]  lauded and carried on shoulders no we'll get lied about FM three dash three nine

[57:56.040 --> 58:03.760]  2013 I'm afraid it got leaked to us kind of like how Hillary was using the
[58:03.760 --> 58:08.200]  State Department import export system to ship weapons oh that broke here and now
[58:08.200 --> 58:11.600]  three years ago and broke this year I'm not bragging I just want everybody to

[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:52.800]  whatever you call that show and then i saw this last week because i saw an
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.880]  article about demonstrations in austin vermont shootings and i said jacari are
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.440]  you gonna go cover this usually cover the gun beat he goes man we just don't
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.760]  like how it's being put on stuff like that i don't want to go cover it i say
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.480]  yeah you're right let's not cover the other's more gun stuff out there the
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.840]  media is gonna misconstru this and spend it and that's we're getting emails hey
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.720]  you need to cover this and i went whoa whoa whoa i go this is gonna be a set
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.320]  up we're gonna get blamed for this and i'm not worried about getting blamed it's
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.440]  it's good i mean they already say that i'm putting wasp under their you know
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.680]  that there's aliens underneath the unbuilding and here's the daily beast
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:28.080]  article joe begs walked into in that seventy second break and i said wait
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.600]  wait let me tell you it'll say in the article that we ran it and that we had
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.160]  reporters there that it's our event and i opened it up and sure enough it says
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.820]  that when we were there covering the dildos not guns protest which shows how
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:43.120]  crazy the leftist and this is how they work with i've had people get behind me
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:47.200]  and scream kill michelle malcon and in two hours it's all over national TV that
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:54.320]  i said kill a woman this is what they do so that's why we had to be careful we
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.920]  get pushed to go cover something that we understand it could be something to
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.880]  walk us into something but but viewers understand this and people know it and
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.280]  we're exposing these operations but look at this the daily beast that's a news
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:14.240]  week's division conspiracy theorists terrorized our town oh really in four
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:21.160]  wars worst humans invade texas to stage a mass shooting we're the worst humans
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:27.240]  were bendy humanized or counter protested out number 20 to 1 oh see i
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.520]  didn't actually call for demonstration that hundreds or thousands with a
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.520]  bunnet like in san antonio at the alamo see that was something i was part of
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.400]  the with the land commissioner no no no no you just say guys we bring me the
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.400]  donald trump pinion because because that's a straw man too if you like about
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.440]  beat up the pinion of donald trump i didn't really beat up donald trump so
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.720]  see this is the new cia run you notice last year they admitted they legalized
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:54.760]  lying legalized cia and other groups engaging in deception this is the next
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.880]  phase where they'll just come out and say alex jones says child molesters are
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.880]  good never said it they'll just say i said it and or alex jones tried to
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:12.040]  terrorize the town because there was a mock mass shooting we didn't do that we
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:18.600]  weren't there leon was there at the other protest that's what we covered but
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:24.080]  doesn't matter because they can just beat up the straw man of donald's rubber
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.760]  alex jones oh my gosh we just caught this donald trump trying to rob the
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.280]  office call the police oh look i could beat him up haha what a man oh i'm so

[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:46.320]  it is an incredible time to be alive general Michael Flynn multi-star general
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:52.920]  former head of defense intelligence agency that's Pentagon intelligence one
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:58.560]  of the most important intelligence agencies of the 16 went public and said
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.640]  we were ordered to create al Qaeda and ISIS and let them take over Syria it was
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:08.080]  a conscious plan and we don't like it we don't stand with it and I told you at
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:14.080]  the time there is absolute war in the Pentagon between the State Department and
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:21.240]  a faction of the CIA on one side and factions of the CIA defense intelligence
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:26.960]  the U.S. Army on the other side
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:36.960]  and I've been told this by let's just say active duty people this is extremely
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.200]  dangerous and we've talked about it hundreds of times here the last few
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.800]  years you saw the military including officers holding up signs saying I won't
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.800]  be al Qaeda's Air Force in Syria two and a half three years ago Rand Paul coming
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.840]  out saying we shouldn't be al Qaeda's Air Force many of the officers hold up
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.960]  the signs info wars.com we had Tosh Plumlee retire as a CIA contractor to
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:03.560]  go public here and say from NATO and from military confirming shipping high
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:10.840]  impact toe missiles stinger missiles and others directly to Syrian rebels via
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:21.040]  Turkey and now volume 38 number one January 7th 2016 just came out this
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:30.400]  morning it is a lengthy Psy Hirsch report 14 pages long that we will do a
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.960]  special report on the news about tonight and more in the third hour it is
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.680]  unbelievable this is a two-time Pulitzer prize winner this is a man given CIA
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:44.480]  clearance to investigate he is a listener he's emailed back and forth
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.960]  with us but never comes on the show now is the time he has confirmed everything
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.800]  and triplicate that there is a war between senior staff and different
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.960]  agencies and I don't want to say the Navy in the Army but the whole Navy is
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:03.960]  not bad but the Navy has been siding basically with the globalist more than
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:09.760]  the Army because there is a cult of George Washington in the Army and it's
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.400]  really hard to break it because they've done a lot of corrupt bad stuff but this
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:17.040]  is coming down to kill in the country right now and I know Jesse Ventura is a
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.640]  Navy man I'm not back to the Navy we're gonna go to him with big breaking news
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:24.520]  was trip to Russia but that is now all in here that they're funding Al Qaeda Al
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.440]  Nazar ISIS in Turkey sending him in with weapons then the other group of
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:33.120]  generals actually is in contact with Assad this is in the new this is in the
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.520]  New Yorker magazine folks Cy Hirsch not Alex Jones now of course we told you two
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:44.120]  years ago three years ago but this is confirmed they then directly give Assad
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:51.320]  the intel on how to beat him and that's why Colonel Shaffer came on a few months
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.560]  ago and said we are now working with the Russians openly we are going to
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:00.680]  destroy ISIS and Al Qaeda and I said then that was from congressional secret
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.400]  meetings he was at he put out the info here he's authorized to do that
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:09.280]  you understand authorized by the government to come on my show and tell
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.600]  you that there is a full-on war close to Operation Valkyrie going on right now
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:18.960]  where our own government doesn't want to be part of this that is sections of this
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.360]  incredible evil and the Navy SEALs didn't go along with the fake bin Laden
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.120]  store that has blooped their helicopter didn't they I've talked to some of those
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:30.320]  families and people in person they've been on the show years after I told you I
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:36.440]  met with them in person other families but do you understand folks there is a
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:41.400]  full-on war right now for this country and it's dangerous now Jesse Ventura
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.080]  went to Russia to be part of a big press event he was at an event Putin was at
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.760]  had a chance to talk to him briefly very interesting but the big thing Jesse's
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.520]  ever in this excited in a while was about the parallels between how Russia is
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.040]  changing and how America is changing and I asked him to tell me more and he said
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.000]  well you know when I'm coming on the show I'll just tell you then that was
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.520]  last Friday so he joins us now he's got off the grid TV show it's very popular
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.480]  here on different TV networks and things around the world not just here in the
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:12.640]  United States the stories up on info wars.com President Vladimir Putin
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:16.280]  personally thank Jesse Ventura during Moscow visit and I literally during the
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:19.280]  three-minute break was given this article and scanned over it Richard had
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.880]  already read it and was getting ready to highlight it for me but I checked the
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:27.600]  parts he talked about I already knew all this but here's Cy Hersh admitting open
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:31.360]  war going on in the government what do you think when they have top generals
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.240]  coming out saying this and and top analysts saying we've been ordered to
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.360]  protect Al Qaeda and and and ISIS and yes who'd you hear talk about this three
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.640]  years ago Jesse Ventura myself and others we've known what's going on but
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.640]  now it's so out in the open it's so dangerous it makes my head spin and
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:52.600]  yes you've got neocons and you've got the Obama people on one side and then
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.840]  you've got the rest of the military and more libertarian conservatives on the
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:02.800]  other. Now joining us is Jesse Ventura the balance of the hour governor thank
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:07.160]  you so much for coming on I just broke all this here on air Cy Hersh just broke
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.160]  it this morning we've discussed this over and over again when you were on just a
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.920]  few months ago we discussed this exact topic so it's not breaking for us but
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.560]  how incredible is this to have the most respected reporter in the world in my
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.560]  view I don't think that's disputed Seymour Hersh coming out and confirming
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.520]  in a 14 page report this incredible information it's military to military
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:32.080]  Seymour Hersh on US intelligence sharing in the Syrian war headline should be
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.520]  civil war inside the federal government over backing of Al Qaeda Jesse Ventura
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:42.640]  well first of all Alex that's stunning news it's news to me I knew nothing about
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.360]  it I was working out this morning and that's the first I've heard of it it's
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:51.760]  not surprising I will tell you this do you want to know why the Navy gets their
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:58.720]  pick because we've beaten Army 14 years in a row so that that's how they
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.600]  determine who's on top whoever wins the Army Navy game and Navy's won 14 years in
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:10.600]  a row so that's how come Navy gets priority anyway humor aside the
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.400]  situation you got now is because it all goes back to why are we there in the
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:21.160]  first place when you truly look at it you know Alex you and I have beefed over
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:27.200]  immigration and all that stuff and but I here's where I stand now I stand for
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.720]  this and I stand with Major General Smedley Butler the Marine who won two
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.040]  congressional medals of honor our military shouldn't go over 500 miles
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:41.120]  from our own shores so let's bring them home let's secure our borders with the
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.400]  US military both southern and northern borders because we don't want to
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:50.280]  discriminate and let's end all immigration to the United States take down
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:54.840]  the Statue of Liberty say it doesn't apply anymore because if you end just
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:59.640]  immigration to certain people then you're discriminating you either out in the
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.840]  words of immigration it has to be all or not no I get there's two sides to it and
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.320]  I want to get into that later is that's I mean there's so much happening
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.480]  currently but undoubtedly how do you bring in people from Syria a lot of them
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:14.760]  that invaded not even vet them and then let them attack I mean obviously
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.320]  citizens get screened coming in you get screened I mean a lot of these
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.720]  immigrants don't even get screened is the issue Jesse is the unfairness well
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.880]  the unfairness is to it's not the immigrants if you read France wait if
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.600]  you look at the France attack those were Belgian citizens those weren't
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.400]  immigration those weren't people they weren't refugees some of them were out
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.280]  of Greece but but you're right somewhere in Europe but let's expand on this
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.320]  before we get off an immigration how big a deal is it is that it's I mean you
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:44.440]  were in some big panels with former CIA people you name it you're here to talk
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.600]  about your amazing experience in Russia but but we know the West has been
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:53.120]  funding and Turkey's been funding and buying the oil that's all come out our
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.600]  own military is saying they don't want to go along with this I mean that's a
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:03.040]  pretty big deal Alex this is all part of the culture of America today and we are
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.480]  a war culture we must why do you think they're trying to be tried to trump up
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.680]  the cold war with the Russians again because we have to be at war all the
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:19.080]  time to support the military industrial complex and all the money makers you got
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:23.680]  to remember something anytime you go to war there are war profiteers there are
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:29.200]  people that make huge money off the war no war is away from that World War two
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:35.480]  Korea Vietnam you name the war and there are war profiteers people who profit
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:40.960]  from those wars so it's in their best interest to stay at war it's in the best
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.480]  interest they believe of the United States to have a common enemy so that
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:50.600]  we're at war all the time and when they couldn't find one they came in with the
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.760]  war on drugs which has proved to be a war against their very own citizen
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:00.720]  absolutely right the United States of America well let's absolutely let's
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.600]  start getting into Russia because that's really the reason it's so important
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:08.440]  and it ties into this I mean the very same people trying to overthrow Syria are
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.200]  trying to overthrow Ukraine and then spending it that Russia did all this
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.880]  when George Soros and Brzezinski and others admit the State Department spent
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:20.840]  five billion dollars engineering the overthrow of the elected government
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:27.040]  that segues to your trip to Russia that was very interesting yeah no I got to go
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.360]  right you know they carry off the grid is carried by RT America Russian
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:37.080]  television America on Friday nights and they won't have me on our TV so isn't
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.880]  ironic that a former governor has to go get his show on Russian television so
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:47.920]  does Larry King yeah so does Larry King that's right but no RT is a tremendous
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:54.800]  station I love the station and they offered my wife and I all expenses paid
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.400]  to go to Moscow for their 10th anniversary it was the 10th anniversary of
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:04.240]  Russian television America and I learned that President Putin was very
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.600]  instrumental in the creation of this television it was there when he got there
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.560]  but he really got behind it and so there was rumor he would show up at the
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.960]  at the fest at the occasion that night and sure enough it was confirmed that
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:23.320]  he did and so it was it was remarkable to me to be honored because they brought
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.360]  all the people who are on Russian television up on the stage and to be
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.240]  honored and I'm sitting there it was like being in the twilight zone I mean
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:37.560]  here I am a Vietnam veteran I've lived through the entire Cold War I've looked
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:42.960]  at these people with fear my whole life because I've been brainwashed to do so
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:48.680]  and I get over there and I find out guess what they're just like we are they
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:54.040]  really and truly are the people when I when I traveled there I left here at
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:58.880]  night and traveled and got there at night I'm driving to the hotel and I'm
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:06.200]  looking outside and Minnesota is a very festive Christmas state when it comes to
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.720]  putting out lights and all the perfunalia that goes along with the
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:17.240]  celebration of Christmas Minnesota looked like pikers compared to Moscow my
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:23.880]  wife and I had never seen so many decorations honoring and enjoying the
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:28.560]  festive holidays we did driving at night in Moscow I actually fought for a
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.000]  moment they took me up they did circles up there for 10 to 12 hours and then
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.720]  landed me back in Minneapolis because you know what the next thing I saw over
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:44.480]  there was no Donald's and Kentucky fried chicken
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:50.840]  and I truly thought am I still in Minneapolis and but then of course you
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:54.680]  know that it went on and we went to the thing and Putin was there Putin got up
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:59.560]  and gave a speech that was outstanding and I have to back him up on it he said
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:04.480]  that they would never interfere with our with our opinions on the show he would
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:09.600]  never interfere in any of our creativity of we the talent could bring to
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:14.240]  Russian television America and I have to tell you I've been on there for one
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:18.720]  year now and what he spoke was the truth because they have never interfered
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:24.720]  one bit in anything I've talked about any subject that I deemed to give my
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:30.960]  opinion on they they I know I've not been censored I know I'm not censored when
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:36.000]  I've come on your show but that sounds so surreal that you take off in the
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.160]  middle of winter wonderland you land back in the middle of winter wonderland
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.560]  and you also talked about putting coming over and talking to you I want you to
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.600]  repeat that for folks and then also talk about some of the other panels that you
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.760]  were part of and your description of me that Russia is going in the right
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:56.240]  direction it looks like and we're going in the wrong direction yep so so so you
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:01.640]  want me to go I thought we were going to break no I skipped it no you president
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:06.200]  Putin was sitting there and after I was honored when he got up to leave he came
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:10.600]  up the aisle and he expressly came over to me and we shook hands and looked eye
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:15.480]  to eye and he quietly leaned into me and he just said very quietly thank you
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:20.400]  governor which I was astounded over because first of all he gave me my
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.520]  title which I rarely get any more in the United States of America you know
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:31.000]  people don't refer to me as the governor anymore but yet he did and the big
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.840]  things out of Putin was his speech to me you know the guy is a dynamic speaker
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:44.360]  and then being around Russia it appears to me that they are heading towards this
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:48.760]  new found freedom that they've discovered since the communists have
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.920]  fallen and now they now refer to them as the communists so we were given a bus
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:59.360]  tour where we drove all over Moscow to go to RT the studios and it required
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:04.240]  about a 45-minute drive and we had a person on board giving it showing us all
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:09.080]  the buildings and this that I got to see the old building that the KGB operated
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.680]  out of and then we actually went into the Kremlin and it's remarkable to go
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:19.160]  into the Kremlin the museum inside the Kremlin is unbelievable and but you get
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:23.840]  and then the biggest thing I was I decided the last day I was gonna be
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:28.920]  wild and really Jesse so I wore my fringe jacket I wear a du-rag I had a
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:33.720]  pair of shades on and I was looking like Jesse the body and I came walking and
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:37.760]  there was a young couple beautiful young couple good boy and a girl couldn't
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:43.040]  speak a word of English but they came up to me so happy and so full of life I
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:48.120]  couldn't believe it because they were astounded over my clothing you know what
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:55.760]  I was wearing and that's the feeling I got over there when I left Moscow it to
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:00.640]  me it was these people are no different than people in Minnesota there is no
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:05.160]  difference the only difference we have is how we're getting orchestrated into
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:09.800]  hating each other for 50 years for no frickin reason well that's right longer
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.440]  than that let me just say my point on this because it's a very important point
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:18.200]  I've studied this in depth social engineers British Royal to the British
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.440]  Empire basically but also Wall Street wanted to bring down the czars and they
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:26.360]  had their own corruption their own problems it was feudal Russia but in
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:31.160]  1917 they funded the Bolsheviks out of the United States and England on record
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.080]  to take it down bring it down it was a color revolution just like you see
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:41.960]  happening in Kiev and Ukraine right now or in or in Assyria rebels were sent in
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:46.640]  after World War one when Russia was weak at the end of it who was our ally we
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.680]  double-crossed them I mean this is our elites did and we put the demons that
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.840]  are communists in there that killed tens of millions of people and then turned
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:57.080]  Russia into basically an enemy of free countries and Russia did do some bad
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.360]  stuff but it gave the United States the cover to do a lot of bad expansion in the
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:06.960]  name of stopping the domino theory so so that was the multi-leveled chess that
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.440]  the globalists were playing now Putin's kicked the oligarchs out kicked the
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.680]  foreigners out he's reversing the eugenics policies reversing the
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.960]  communist programs cutting taxes and and really following an Americana plan the
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:24.760]  Russians love Levi's and what they see is Americana they saw us is what they
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:28.640]  wanted to be Schultz and Eatzen saw that but he saw that evil was here by the
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:32.880]  90s he left back and warned Russia they're coming for you and Putin went and
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.800]  met with him a lot and actually got woken up by Schultz and Eatzen they
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.840]  brought the Orthodox Church back you name it Russia is reforming because they've
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.320]  already hit rock bottom we're now going into the greatest tyranny we've ever
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:50.360]  seen bipartisan and I agree with you I over there I see this budding blossom
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.760]  of freedom happening of people getting their eye there the shackles off and you
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:02.160]  can feel it here the shackles are going on we got one on one ankle right now and
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.480]  they're grabbing for the second ankle right now well said and I see us we are
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:12.280]  going in the opposite directions maybe to the same level maybe Russia will stop
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:17.200]  and will stop when they have everybody shackled down still I don't know I hope
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:22.320]  Russia keeps going in the direction that they're going but we have to stop the
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.680]  direction we're going in and to me the way you stop it if you know Alex the
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:33.760]  right now world opinion if you ask anyone outside the United States what
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.600]  country do you believe you'll most likely go to war with they say the United
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:43.160]  States is number one yes very sad I think we should hang our head shame over
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:50.080]  that as a veteran I do I hang my head shame people think that's wonderful they
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.200]  think that it's great that the rest of the world shakes in their boots worried
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.920]  about whether the United States is going to attack them or not let me bring this
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.120]  up because I want to be clear though and I agree with you totally globalist have
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.360]  hijacked our country they've hijacked Europe they are using our name to do it
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.600]  it's our responsibility to stop it poll show Americans don't like this
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:12.480]  imperialism we're paying for it on top of it and we're trying to reform ourselves
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:16.920]  the problem is the militarists control both major parties now expanding on that
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:19.720]  I don't know if you saw the last Republican debate but Santorum said
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:24.040]  it's time to punch the Russians in the nose give them a bloody nose then Chris
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:28.280]  Christie said I want to start shooting down their aircraft and Rand Paul looked
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.440]  at them and said well if you want World War three vote for these maniacs exactly
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.840]  you know what gets me every one of these big mouths that state all that talk all
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:43.080]  that robust crap have never served themselves they have nobody in the
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.560]  military they don't have a dog in the fight but they're happy to send your
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:52.960]  kids off to die you know if one of the first things I do Alex if I became
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:59.160]  president I would work to pass a law that anyone that votes to go to war they
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:05.160]  must predesignate a family member be the nephew somebody they must predesignate a
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:10.200]  family member who when they take that vote to go to war that family member
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:15.040]  immediately starts military service well that sounds very draconian but if you
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.120]  go back to the age of chivalry that really ended about 200 years ago or so in
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:23.720]  Europe and Japan you name it I didn't end told just about 50 years ago they would follow a leader
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:30.280]  about draconian I care that they need a dog in the fight I'm 64 years old now
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:34.760]  Alex and I've watched us go through Korea Vietnam and all the rest of this
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.920]  well governor let me just let me just agree with you because here my whole
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:43.480]  point it sounds draconian but it's not because in every culture if the king
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:47.200]  didn't put his sons in the front lines or if he didn't fight no one would
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:52.200]  follow him it's a default and so I want to go on further all these politicians I
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:55.920]  don't care how old they are who they are there needs to be a provision that
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:00.480]  there's combat units just for them that they've got a command from the front line
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:04.200]  when they call for war I think they should be in the middle of it governor
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:11.360]  well you're not gonna get that settle for my mind that they at least have to
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:18.400]  name a family member be it a daughter a son or somebody has to begin military
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:27.600]  service at the point of the boat because Alex I was asked one time by Jason
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:31.040]  Lewis a right wing talk show host here in Minnesota I think he's running for
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:36.800]  Congress now you know but I was asked by him one time he said it's a it's a a
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:42.120]  whole it's a huge decision to make the decision to go to war it's a difficult
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:46.840]  difficult decision and I looked at Lewis I said not look Jason I said it's an
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:49.880]  easy decision stay there governor because we gotta go to break come back and tell
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:54.320]  us the story does even turn a hot interview Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:03.280]  it's 3650 off that's because you're signing up for a year getting six months
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:07.080]  free it would be like you know 70 something bucks but with the two months
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.800]  free it's 54 and then with the six months three it's 36 so that's how that works

[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.920]  promote basic liberty and freedom in this country now going back to the former
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:02.400]  Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura whose own TV show got censored that's inside
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.120]  baseball but I wish he'd tell that story sometime it's pretty pretty revealing
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:11.920]  he just got back from Russia amazing talks with CIA former people at panels
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.720]  you name it governor let's get into more of what you witnessed in Russia then I
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:21.280]  want to shift gears into Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump being buddies you now
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:24.880]  know Vladimir Putin and of course your friends with Donald Trump that's quite a
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:29.440]  story right there as well I guess so well the big thing was they also had
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:33.320]  panel discussions over there with moderators and things like that you
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:37.240]  could sit in on them and the one I found very interesting there were two former
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:43.120]  lifetime CIA people who are now retired one of a whistleblower and the real
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:46.760]  thing we were dealing with communication so that's what they kind of
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:52.120]  centered everything about because it's television and not they talked about how
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:56.760]  all of this surveillance that they're putting the United States people under
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:01.040]  violating our Fourth Amendment rights and they've got us all now under
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:06.240]  surveillance clearly they both guys said it doesn't work and won't work and they
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:11.160]  said the clear example is what just took place in Southern California if the
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.600]  surveillance worked these people would have been apprehended before they did
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:21.840]  what they did so clearly it's a snow job they can't protect you with their
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.000]  surveillance both men were very clear on that but you're not going to be
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.880]  protected any better by putting everyone under surveillance all your emails all
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:37.080]  your telephone calls and basically they told us that they all are now whether
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:41.840]  or not they get the places but basically they said the entire United States is
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.000]  under surveillance right now well Drake has been on William Benny's been on the
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.880]  former head of technical for the NSA and they said it's even worse than what
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:54.080]  you're saying you're absolutely right they are taking in so much data that
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.760]  then any real data gets lost like a needle a haystack that exactly that's
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.800]  what these two guys said they said they may get the data but there's so much of
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:08.400]  it because they're they're not targeting they're just doing this blanket
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:14.520]  coverage of putting every person's email under surveillance that they can't
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:19.240]  possibly find you know the bad ones slipped by it or they're going they may
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.960]  find a few but there's going to be some that slip by let's go further let's go
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:27.520]  further it actually came out the Associated Press and Reuters that the
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.960]  FBI was investigating the mosque and these two reported shooters but was
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:36.480]  ordered by Obama administration and the civil rights task force to stop it two
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:40.320]  years ago so it's it's even beyond that it's even worse than that but you're
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:44.040]  right they're using the threat of terror to take our liberties and to launch all
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:47.360]  these new wars remember Saudi Arabia supposedly was involved in the attacks
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:52.280]  which we now know with 28 pages so we attack Iraq and governor do you feel
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:56.080]  vindicated because when you four years ago did your big 9-11 special
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:00.120]  interviewed all those experts you got demonized nationally for bare minimum
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:03.600]  saying Saudi Arabia was involved in our government stood down we know it's
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:08.000]  worse than that and you look at building 7 on national TV never before done I
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  mean that was truly groundbreaking material and now that stuff's all been
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.640]  verified it's all come out well I feel personally vindicated I'm not sure if the
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:24.000]  public has taken the stigma off me yet because the public still loves to keep
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.720]  the blinds in front of their eyes for whatever reason they like the comfort
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:33.600]  zone they don't want to know the truth and so I personally feel vindicated you
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:40.360]  know if they'd released these 28 pages that direct show a direct monetary from
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:45.720]  from the hijackers to Saudi Arabia which which our senator Graham and
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:51.040]  congressman cook assured me that's what's in it they've read it and if that
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:55.040]  be the case then that does change 9-11 completely and then it begs the
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:01.280]  question why in hell did we invade Iraq you know that I don't know did you ever
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:06.080]  see that special Vince Boogliosi did about prosecuting George Bush for murder
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:10.360]  if you haven't watched it I've seen it we had Boogliosi promoted it's very
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:18.000]  powerful oh I watched it the other day and was fuming out my ears but see I'm
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.280]  bipartisan just like you are I wonder Boogliosi's gonna expose Obama for all
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:27.760]  the war he's all that's right that's right Vince Vince passed away a year ago
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:32.200]  I knew that I just I forget people have died the older you get it's like you
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.840]  start talking about somebody go wait a minute they're dead yeah
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:39.800]  unfortunately Vince went went to the other side of about a year ago and I
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:45.200]  well I'll truly miss him because he and I differed greatly on the killing of
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:49.880]  Kennedy but we still were able to remain good friend well he sure was wrong
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:55.040]  about that very much I mean Kennedy is open and shut it's ridiculous I don't
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.880]  know I don't know why you know I'm reading a book right now Alex that's
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:05.720]  phenomenal I'll tell that road if it's on it's on Alan Dulles oh yeah unbelievable
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:10.920]  I encourage people get this book it will show you there's even tie-ins from Alan
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:15.560]  Dulles to Donald Rumsfeld I knew that through L. L. Limpenser yeah yeah
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:20.840]  Rumsfeld first worked for L. L. Limpenser who Eisenhower fired when he came up
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:26.760]  with the Northwoods plan well anyway that this book by Talbot's phenomenal it
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:33.120]  deals totally with Alan Dulles from when he got took over the CIA all the way
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:37.120]  through till he died I'm not even finished I'm just up to the Kennedy
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.960]  killing right now but it's an unbelievable book that I encourage
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:45.840]  people if you got the guts read it to read the truth about how they over got
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:50.320]  this guy murdered people throughout the world so how easy would it be him for
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.800]  him to just turn around and murder our president he murdered other presidents
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:59.360]  well let me just say in Texas in Austin and in Dallas when you get around rich
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.240]  people and famous people and folks involved these administrations I have
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:08.280]  actually been on airplanes and at parties where people sit around shooting
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:12.560]  their mouth off about killing that son of a bitch JFK I mean it's not it's not
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:16.560]  hidden around here and that's why LBJ in front of his his mistress who I
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.360]  interviewed many other people just walked around bragging about it I mean it
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:27.040]  wasn't even debated I mean my grandmother dated well one of one of the LBJ's
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:31.720]  hitman before she got married I'm sorry go ahead well it became it became part
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:35.880]  of the world then because they were being so successful throughout the rest of
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:42.560]  the world over throwing every if any if any country elected a president who is
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:48.080]  it all leftist or at all for the people and not for big industry or
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:52.680]  corporations the United States would go in there and overthrow their governments
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:58.440]  it's horrible what when you read about it I absolutely agree with what you're
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.520]  saying now now now again let's let's drill in here to this Donald Trump
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:08.800]  situation and the situation that ties into Putin and Hillary because I guess
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:14.960]  you know all three of these people but I guess Trump the the best Hillary's come
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:18.400]  out and said that Putin has journalists killed and I'm sure Putin isn't perfect
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.480]  but I've never seen the cut and dry evidence of it and now Donald Trump has
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:28.880]  fired back defending Putin I mean imagine if Trump did get in and then we
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:32.240]  didn't have to have a new Cold War with Russia imagine actually trying to have
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:36.240]  peace I think that's what really puts Donald Trump in danger let's go to this
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:41.560]  clip final question about Vladimir Putin when you were pressed about his
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:45.200]  killing of journalists you said I think our country does plenty of killing to
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.800]  what were you thinking about killing sanctioned by the US government is like
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:53.400]  killing journalists well I think number one I think Hillary when she was
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:57.760]  Secretary of State made some horrible horrible decisions and thousands and
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:00.960]  thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people have been killed I
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:04.920]  mean you look at what went on in Libya you look at so many bad decisions that
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:13.480]  she made she's incompetent as far as I'm concerned as far as the reporters are
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:18.480]  concerned obviously I don't want that but I think it's horrible but in all
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.600]  fairness to Putin you're saying he killed people I haven't seen that I don't
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:26.280]  know that you've been able to prove that you know the names of the reporters
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:31.280]  that he's killed because I've been you know you've been hearing this but I haven't
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:35.240]  seen the name now I think it would be despicable if that took place but I
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:40.920]  haven't seen any evidence that he killed anybody in terms of reporters here's
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:43.840]  what here's what Mitt Romney tweeted about that he said there's an important
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.840]  distinction here thug Putin kills journalists and opponents our
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:53.200]  presidents kill terrorists and enemy combatants let's stop right there okay
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:48:00.080]  there's no proof no convictions and enemy combatants and doctors right but
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:07.840]  they don't have any proof it's like they say that I say that yeah I mean Alex I'm
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.560]  just adding they forgot to put in doctors I agree remember when we attacked
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:17.800]  it attacked doctors without well they also attack press stations they they
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:22.720]  blew up the the Belgrade national TV station killing a bunch of people in
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:29.560]  Serbia yeah so you know people need to understand the United States of America
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:35.440]  isn't clean on this we've been doing dastardly things throughout the world
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:39.920]  my entire life governor I totally agree with you but here's my angle they claim
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:43.680]  you got pulled over drunk in LA at the airport when you weren't in LA and
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:47.160]  weren't drunk and there was no police record they claim that you made fun of
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.320]  dead Navy SEALs with no proof you went in court you can't get your name back in
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:54.800]  some areas the same thing with me they say every day things I never said and
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.680]  now they say it about Putin where is the proof oh their proof is Mitt Romney
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:05.600]  says so I mean again that's crazy go ahead oh I agree totally you know a guy
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:11.200]  with magic underwear I'm gonna believe him anyway I shouldn't have said that I
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:18.040]  guess but I had to throw a little comedic back at it but you know that's the
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:23.880]  whole thing who do you believe because we get fed so much propaganda in this
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:29.640]  country a couple years about two years ago Vladimir Putin did a major speech
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:34.680]  that was carried throughout the world yet no no one in the United States carried
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:40.840]  this speech why why why aren't we allowed to hear what the guy has to say
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:44.880]  that's like Nazi Germany wouldn't let foreign media in that's a real sign of
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:49.960]  totalitarianism the old Russia with Alex will be hazing like Germany look at
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:54.920]  our cops out on the street today they don't look like police officers they
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:59.840]  look like Nazi Stormtroopers and that has been the federal government pushing
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:05.760]  that whole agenda whatever is pushing it we need to look in the mirror if you
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:12.480]  read about 1930s Germany you compare to what's going on here today it's identical
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:19.520]  people wake up did you see a lot of police in Moscow you see a few sure yeah
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:23.040]  I mean the Kremlin's you know you got to go through security to get into the
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:28.080]  Kremlin how are they dressed huh how are the Russian police dressed they were
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:33.600]  dressed more they're dressed more like like Cossack so I don't know they're

[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:14.880]  tell your calls the thing I like about the fact that we're able to broadcast
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:18.640]  three four hours a day as we can really get into some long-form ideas or really
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:22.280]  break some things down and that's why I like Donald Trump for all of his
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:25.560]  problems nobody's perfect you know he says hey we shouldn't be bombing all
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:28.080]  these countries we should come home and rebuild America well that's what Jesse
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:32.440]  Ventura says and then they criticize Trump because that's not a Republican
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:36.360]  talking point well it's just a common sense talking point we're going bankrupt
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:39.960]  we have to rebuild this country I'm now stealing Ventura's thunder but he was
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:43.360]  preaching to me during the break that that was important to do and I totally
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:46.320]  agree with him I mean what's the military industrial complex gonna do if they
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:51.840]  fully bankrupt this country governor well that's just it we've spent over 1.7
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.320]  trillion dollars trillion in the war on terror over there we've accomplished
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:03.960]  nothing I say you bring the troops home use them to secure your borders and take
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:08.840]  all you take this defense money and start rebuilding America do people in this
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:14.920]  country realize every time we drop a bomb that that could be a new bridge and
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:20.680]  that could be jobs to people building that bridge it's time to come home fix
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:26.160]  up our country take care of our bad that is not a Democrat talking point handle
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:30.240]  the wrong problem and that's not a Democratic talking point whenever
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:32.920]  Trump says that accusment being a Democrat you're not a Democrat Jesse
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:38.040]  that's just common sense hell no I'm not either I'm your I'm your independent
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:42.320]  who's always been independent I'm a free thinker but I know the difference
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.960]  between right and wrong absolutely let's go to Nick in Michigan he's a Marine
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:52.440]  vet you're on the air go ahead Nick
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:57.440]  Governor Ventura it's a absolute honor to talk to you this is really both you
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:03.160]  guys my I'm a Marine veteran my oldest brother still active duty I have a
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:07.480]  younger brother who also served my dad served and now my youngest brother who
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:12.280]  has a college education he's looking to enlist in the Marine Corps right
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:18.360]  now and me and my dad my one brother trying to talk him out of at least talk
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:21.520]  him out of going in the Marine Corps what would you say to somebody in that
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.600]  situation who has a college degree I would say don't do it because the
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:27.600]  vaccines alone is a death sentence I mean it just they had heard some bad but
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:31.880]  Governor what's your view on this thank you Nick but my view is simple I come
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:36.040]  from a similar family everyone in my both my mother and father were World War
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:40.800]  2 vets and everyone in my family served that's an individual thing at a
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:46.040]  decision someone has to make and that's their decision to make what I say to
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:51.320]  young people is this always remember if you take that step and you raise and
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:55.760]  take an oath remember in that oath you're taking an oath to protect the
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:00.960]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights of this country against all enemies foreign
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.120]  and domestic and never forget that's right you took an oath to do that that's
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:09.120]  right let's go to wild in Wisconsin another call from Wisconsin you're on the
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:15.800]  air go ahead Jonesy mr. governor with the upper and lower arcana at hand with
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:20.160]  the globalist Trump has to seal the deal for the presidency before the book of
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:25.000]  tricks gets fully implemented Trump needs to have a dog in the fight and make a
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.280]  masterpiece of a deal with the American people and the establishment if he
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.640]  doesn't make America great again they should take his name off the building
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:38.680]  what's your question for governor Ventura we have limited time sure I
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:43.960]  want to know if mr. Ventura believes Trump to be legitimate or part of the
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:49.000]  CEO elite class that's a really great question Jesse well I think Trump is his
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.400]  own man in a lot of ways I don't know for certain don't take it to the bank but
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:57.640]  he was involved in the independent movement he actually came to a fundraiser
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:02.080]  in Minnesota way back in the 90s when I ran as an independent for governor and
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:07.160]  Donald's always kind of rattled his sword about running I never believed he
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:11.400]  actually would and then this year he fired I said I don't believe it I think
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:15.640]  Donald does it for the publicity he's a brilliant man this year he actually has
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:19.600]  done it and this year he looks like he's gonna see it through till the end and
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.880]  you know that he the guy can do what he wants he's got enough money to where he
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:29.280]  can't be stopped on the monetary end so there you go Jesse Ventura says he's
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:33.080]  his own man I agree with that I've now had some behind-the-scenes stuff and
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:36.320]  there's had a lot of it and Trump's for real does that mean he's perfect
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:39.600]  absolutely not we'll be back in 70 seconds final segment with Ventura more

[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.400]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music

[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:18.280]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:22.520]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:25.560]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take
[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:29.120]  we worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are

[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:16.240]  stories up on infowars.com MSNBC says white men with guns bigger threat than
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:21.560]  radical Islam white men just incredible race baiting Jesse Ventura is with us
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:26.960]  you can of course go to aura TV and find us off the grid show very popular
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:30.880]  be sure to spread the word about that it's also on our team and we're taking
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:36.080]  phone calls right now and and Jesse you've also updated your book tell
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:41.160]  folks about that your latest book well we did a we did a updated American
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:45.480]  conspiracies where we added four new conspiracies to it Alex it seems that
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:49.680]  every year you'll get a new one these days because the government will do
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.520]  something or something will rise up that you realize is a major cover-up and
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:58.600]  you know we did that we did a thing on POWs which was close to me because you
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:02.080]  love to believe when you join the military that then you're told that if
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:06.200]  you ever get captured our government will do anything and everything to get
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:10.760]  you returned home well it's simply not true if you become a political liability
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:14.840]  kiss your butt goodbye they could care less about you well look at Pat
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:17.040]  gentlemen he didn't go along with an arrow they killed him dead in a hammer
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:23.760]  Joe and Connecticut you're on the air with Jesse Ventura go ahead hi governor
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:28.560]  this is Joe from Connecticut I I want I don't know if this has been asked of you
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:32.880]  but I want to ask you if Donald Trump gets the nomination which I believe he's
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:36.960]  going to and I sure hope he is would you consider being his running mate because
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:40.760]  I think the two years would be a fantastic combination Joe Joe thank you
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:45.800]  your radio's on I'm gonna let you go go ahead Jesse well first of all remember
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:52.960]  this is the Republican Party Jesse Ventura is hardly a Republican they know
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:58.000]  me I'm like Che Guevara to them I'm the revolutionary I'm the independent I
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  belong to neither party you don't think that my life line I well I said it
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.680]  jokingly I told Roger Stone I said if Donald truly wants to kick off the
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:12.000]  Republicans he should pick me as his running mate the ultimate independent
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.760]  to bring that independent vote along it would be a smart move on Trump's part to
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:21.720]  do that but whether it were I doubt it would ever happen and besides I still
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:25.320]  have to make the decision on whether I make a libertarian move the end of May
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:30.320]  and that was my next question look I'm not normally the third party runs if
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:32.960]  you're gonna try to choose somebody from one of the two parties and normally I
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:36.160]  mean I didn't support McCain or Obama because that I see your view about him
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:40.920]  being two gangs but Trump clearly trying to take over the Republican Party if
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:44.000]  they steal the delegates in a broker convention which Jeb Bush says they're
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.120]  planning to do Jeb's got 5% of the vote but he gets the nomination you've got
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:51.920]  to have Trump go the only place you get ballot access would be with the
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:56.560]  libertarians and so if you take that slot that he can't take it but his ace
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:00.720]  in the hole is leaving and taking over the libertarian nomination yeah the
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:05.560]  problem is the lip Alex the libertarians nominate the end of May the
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:11.000]  republicans won't even decide till July no I understand that will stay with the
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.360]  republicans till it's too late and then he can't come back to the
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:20.320]  libertarians he's got to ride the horse to the convention doesn't he yes and
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:24.320]  that's the problem and that's the problem once he goes to the convention if
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:28.880]  they steal it from him he has nowhere to go because the libertarians will have
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:33.680]  already nominated in May are you concerned that they may be planning
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:37.680]  like they've done before to try to steal the nominations from him I don't know
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:41.880]  I'm always concerned about that you know I don't trust the either one of these
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:45.960]  two political parties to me they're they're a gang of thieves because they
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:50.960]  operate under the concept of bribery all they do is their job is to go out and
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:55.800]  take bribes and pass it on and you bribe them and you get what you want and the
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:04:00.960]  people of America hell we're third or fourth on their list you know number one
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:05.360]  is their parties number two is the people of corporations that finance them
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:12.000]  and the big money we might be third we might even be as low as fourth well
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.680]  folks you can so the personal gain would be third what can I achieve what
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:20.800]  what level can I help myself out personally instead of being in public
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:24.920]  service so we the people of America probably align ourselves up as the
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:30.800]  fourth choice with these two political parties that's right well folks you can
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:35.920]  find aura TV and off the grid Jesse Ventura governor I don't want to say I'm
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:40.120]  you know glad you didn't go to Mexico this this this Christmas but I'm glad
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:43.240]  you're here so you come on the show look forward to speaking to you more as the
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:47.600]  campaign unfolds and who knows maybe see you throw your hat in the ring well I'm
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:51.600]  not throwing it out yet I'm sitting back in the weeds and watching Alex and I
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:55.920]  want to see what comes through the wash I gotta see the Piper's get up one last
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:58.800]  funny thing to say there the brakes firing gotta come right back
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:03.000]  Syrian refugee admitted his main goal is not to escape war or ISIS persecution
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.320]  but to convert Europeans to Islam he said quote my main goal for leaving
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:11.360]  this area is to lead the people to the acceptance of Islam I swear by a lot
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:15.480]  that I only came here for this one goal I have observed that they are curious
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:18.600]  and willing to get to know Islam through us and he's not the only one
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:21.640]  influential she had recently gave a speech in which she encouraged radical
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:25.520]  Muslims to use the migrant crisis to quote breed with Europeans and conquer
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:29.160]  their countries but this modern-day Islamic conquest is not just happening
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:32.840]  only in Europe here in the US radical Muslims are building their own Islamic
[02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:36.320]  compounds and communities while telling Christians and other non-Muslims to keep
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:39.720]  out and these communities are rapidly expanding in fact the Obama
[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:43.520]  administration has admitted nearly 400 Syrian refugees into the US and see
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:47.800]  November 13th Paris attacks and only one of them is a Christian but Christians
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:51.280]  comprise about 10% of the population in Syria so why isn't the Obama
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:55.040]  administration allowing more Christian refugees into the US I'll let you decide

[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:40.880]  interview that he's been hanging around with us he's about to leave and I know
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:44.480]  we got loaded phone lines I need to get into some more world news I need to get
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:51.480]  into some really important news with the economy some really important news when
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:55.560]  it comes to geoengineering in fact Jesse Ventura wanted to tell one more funny
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:59.720]  Chris Christie story but it's so intriguing you know all the inside
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:02.840]  baseball and things that the governor knows with the people he sees all over
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:05.960]  the country that look forward to having him back sometimes to tell some of his
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:09.840]  more interesting stories not just from Hollywood but but politics and as a
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:14.640]  governor as a mayor you name it a lot of the stories I know but I'm not allowed
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.480]  to tell them because I was there and it's all private and I get holding your
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:23.480]  cards close to the vest but man I wish people knew about Homeland Security in
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:27.920]  the TV show the rest of it I think people don't get how much trouble you've
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:30.720]  got to go through to get on the air and talk about these topics and one of those
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:35.040]  governor and then we'll get into your Chris Christie story I'm glad that you
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:38.360]  were able to stay longer I'm gonna cover this the bottom of the hour folks
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:43.640]  Smithsonian came out Saturday Associated Press on Sunday and a whole bunch of
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:49.400]  other articles admitting that oh the jet exhaust is darkening the atmosphere and
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:53.640]  is toxic and they don't know what's happening even though we have thousands
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:57.560]  of documents admitting it's part of a program since the 90s where of course
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:00.720]  the pilots don't know but it's added to the jet fuel then their spray planes as
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:05.360]  well you expose that yet again the first time on national television and got
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:09.920]  made fun of that ridiculed I have friends who like the show and believe in
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:14.600]  conspiracies but they think this is kooky even though it's admitted so what
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:19.480]  do you make of that announcement here's the Smithsonian calm airplane contrails
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:23.880]  may be creating accidental geoengineering well nothing accidental about it
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:28.320]  Jesse well there probably is nothing accidental about anything out of the
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:34.120]  story I'll tell us this they have McDonald's over in Moscow and Putin is
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:38.640]  so opposed to the GMR's they won't allow them in Moscow genetic
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:45.520]  modified food and so the McDonald's there has to use all Russian ingredients
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:50.240]  and people told me now I didn't try it but people told me McDonald hamburgers
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:54.840]  in Moscow are way better than the hamburgers in the United States oh yeah
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:58.000]  oh yeah they have standards and if there's been articles on this governor
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.240]  you can look it up so what you're telling us is just proven by other you know
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:05.440]  food critics in Japan in Russia and other countries they have rules that you've
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:10.240]  got to use domestic food as part of the franchise and you can get a McDonald's
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:15.760]  burger like they had 35 years ago that is actually good of the the fried chicken
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:20.600]  doesn't have all the GMO all the chemicals all the antibiotics absolutely
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:23.280]  it's well known that the foods better over there because they won't allow
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:26.720]  additives that did you hear Putin came out and said he wants to make Russia the
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:32.840]  first world exporter of organic food no I didn't but it doesn't surprise me after
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:36.320]  hearing him speak that night it wouldn't surprise me at all let me finish with
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:41.160]  this Alex you know Chris Christie seems to be this major hawk he wants to blow
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:45.960]  everybody out of the air and do all that Chris Christie couldn't even serve in
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:50.760]  the military Alex when you go into boot camp they require that you at least have
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:58.840]  to be able to do one sit-up and one push-up you're kidding he couldn't do
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:04.400]  one push-up or one set up you think he could no I bet he couldn't that's what
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:09.480]  I mean here's a guy telling all the kids to go to war and he he and his whole
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:13.040]  life could never even make it into the military because he's so out of shape
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:19.200]  what is it about neocons hawks that that the ones that shoot their mouths off
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:23.360]  about bloody noses and kill the Russians are the ones that never served I
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:26.440]  mean I was never in the military I said enough history to know that you just
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:30.760]  don't nonchalantly start wars but but but even in the past people that were
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:35.080]  warrior presidents or kings weren't respected for shooting their mouths off
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:38.720]  about we're gonna crush the enemy because that was seen as bad luck I mean
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:42.400]  I mean I mean as a Navy SEAL I mean I know a lot of special forces guys they'll
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:45.680]  never brag about how tough they are they'll never brag about killing people
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:50.880]  I mean isn't that looked down upon by real warriors yeah absolutely now that's
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:54.880]  being that's a little different today because today they seem to like to come
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:00.120]  home and write books about it but in my day you didn't discuss that we we used
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:04.840]  to operate under the simple premises the Las Vegas thing what happens on
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:11.960]  deployment stays on deployment well that simple your father had six bronze
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:16.880]  battle stars in World War two I didn't even know what till he died and I read
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:22.320]  it on his DD-240 is discharge papers yeah my dad's dad was in the Army Air
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:26.200]  Corps as a pilot and he always said oh I got heat stroke hurt my eyes not wearing
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:30.360]  sunglasses only flew a few missions and then when he died they got into all his
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:33.600]  stuff and he'd done his missions and then you know after you did your catch
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:37.960]  22 then you know he was put into just Army management and stuff in the
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:42.640]  invasion of Italy but he never told the family any of it no one ever knew any of
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:47.920]  it no that's the way it was done that was see my father interesting for me I
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:53.280]  came out of the 50s and my mother did all the driving and I could never figure
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:57.880]  out why because this was the leave at the beaver era dad's drove mom's did in
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:02.760]  my family my mom drove so I asked my dad one day I said dad how come you don't
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:07.840]  drive and he told me said all I don't trust myself and I thought that's
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:11.560]  legitimate if you don't trust yourself you shouldn't drive well when my dad
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:16.560]  passed away my mom told me the real reason post traumatic stress he was in
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:22.320]  the 699th anti-tank division under Patton and apparently he drove these
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.400]  anti-tank things over so many dead bodies that he could never get behind the
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:32.840]  wheel of a car again yeah I was trying to get these work my dad walked to work
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:40.160]  every morning two miles walk to work never drove a car and people like Chris
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:48.080]  Christie thinks war is sexy yeah that's our culture today Alex we're making
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:53.900]  war look like it's a wonderful thing it is not wonderful people it's man at his
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:15:00.640]  lowest level it's the worst man can possibly be his war and yet we're
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:05.440]  turning in I mean I get embarrassed when I watch these ads on TV with Arnold
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:12.240]  in the war game Schwarzenegger I don't follow him he's tell me about it no
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:17.480]  it's on he's doing some sort of war video game now that are also popular and
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:22.880]  they got him dressed up in a uniform and with the way he talks it sounds and
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:30.040]  looks like the Nazis I tell you and then it's all glorified you look at all
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:36.360]  these these games they put out to the kids it all glorifies war there's some
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:41.200]  wonderful wonderful thing and the final thing and I'll stop bitching when I I'm
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:46.960]  so anti now when I learned that our Department of Defense was paying
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:52.760]  professional sports to honor the veterans that was the last straw for me
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:58.840]  Alex I will not go live to another pro sports event my life I don't believe I'm
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:02.200]  looking at this video of Schwarzenegger taking over an army war room and it is
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:06.640]  totally Nazi though all the iconography the way he's operating the way he's
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:12.600]  saying how great war is and our public things war now is a video game I'm not
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:19.240]  mad at him but that's the culture of America today well Arnold has become a
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:23.520]  caricature of a caricature and I tell you with all these chicken hawks and
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:27.360]  people out there pushing war it is certainly a scary thing and I don't
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:30.800]  think you're bitching I think you're bringing up concerns that most
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:34.080]  Americans and others really really have Jesse Ventura thank you so much for the
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:37.720]  time today thank you Alex always a pleasure and maybe we'll do it again
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:42.160]  before I head south please please come back on and thanks for the time take
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:45.960]  care take care bye bye all right there he goes now I've talked to Ventura during
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:50.200]  a break and I said are you serious about building a wall now and bring our
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:53.440]  military home and he goes no I'm not joking because I said look I don't want
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:56.520]  to get into the immigration thing with you again whole crew heard it and I'm
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:16:58.920]  not saying something about a school he said he'd say it again on air but we
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:02.040]  forgot to get into it again because I was talking to him during a break like
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:04.360]  30 minutes ago I said hey repeat everything you just said on air and he
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:08.160]  was okay I will and then we never got to it but I was like listen I don't want to
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:11.800]  get into the immigration fight because on your side they say we all want to throw
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:15.400]  women and children out and we're not loving and on our side we're saying we
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:18.640]  just can't pay for everything free but the Democrats advertise a bunch of
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:22.360]  anti-gunners to come in because that's what's happening they brag it's getting
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:28.720]  over so he's like oh no no I'm being serious I'm saying with all the security
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:31.400]  stuff the rest of it I'd rather not be an empire bring back the military put it
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:37.440]  on our border stop all immigration actually sounds pretty good for a while
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:43.160]  doesn't it I mean would you end all this garbage do you think countries would
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:46.760]  really attack us we've got submarines and nukes and all this stuff that we just
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:52.120]  left the world alone nobody messes with Switzerland they don't even have nuclear
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:59.560]  weapons they're neutral oh the the jihadis will attack us because criminal
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:03.480]  federal elements are funding with jihadis and letting them come in to
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:08.360]  attack us because they've suspended common sense and logic to where when we
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:14.040]  get attacked the politicians who brought them in don't get in trouble and then
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:17.480]  they get to take our freedoms have hundred billion dollar surveillance
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:22.000]  budgets every year a hundred billion dollars is spent on these intelligence
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:33.160]  agencies and surveillance every year a hundred billion dollars and the
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:36.680]  special interest want to suck this country dry when the country collapses
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:41.200]  down the road it'll be done slowly probably but as it collapses it's by
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:45.400]  design they're going to the world government model now they don't want
[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:48.840]  any country that sovereign any country is strong we got a bunch of calls that
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:51.480]  wanted to talk to Ventura I got to a lot of them and I'll just take your calls

[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:02.240]  the next segment because I've mentioned it a bunch I've talked about it some but

[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:38.120]  gonna set up a planetary government incrementally cut off resources set up
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:41.480]  a technological system where it's impossible for humans to be self-sufficient
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:45.200]  and then use that to incrementally play human groups off against each other
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:51.760]  until they get us into compact reservations and then wipe us out it's
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:54.440]  the equivalent of aliens landing on the planet and carrying this out I mean
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:25:01.480]  it's not aliens but it might as well be it's so epic and I said listen I know we
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:05.320]  got big files in here but just print me the latest geoengineering admissions and
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:09.680]  this new climate treaty and the rest of it I'm gonna cover it tomorrow and then
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:12.400]  during the show I've been looking at these stacks of news which are tiny
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:15.920]  compared to all the patents and all the admissions I mean we've done this
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:25.520]  before and I was here looking at it and it's like my heart dropped like you know
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:30.880]  that feeling of just falling out of your body it's beyond going over a bump in
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:35.920]  the road and you feel your stomach it's like your heart does that you just come
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:41.760]  to grips with something so big so cold so admitted and you know it's real and
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:45.720]  you know it's true I'm gonna cover this now and then go to your calls that way
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:51.400]  I'm not hurrying with the calls and I just looked at each article and you could
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:55.360]  just see the rollout you could see the plan the plans admitted you read the
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:59.200]  article some of them knew it's exactly what you knew would be in the article
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:06.880]  because the articles are all the same it's all these writers from the US England
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:12.040]  Russia Germany Europe all saying the exact same thing it's all meant to
[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:17.320]  slowly roll it out they go oh we might start geoengineering here's how we do
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:21.480]  it oh it's just what the planes already do how magic oh we happen to have
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:26.740]  patents oh we happen to already be testing that that's in the news now the
[02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:32.400]  BBC says oh the chemicals we spray are gonna give you Alzheimer's and kill you
[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:39.760]  but it's for a greater good and you just read that you go man to the writers of
[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:46.080]  this following orders even know what they're taking part in I'm gonna say
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:51.040]  this most adults that are 40 years old or so I believe will most of you will
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:55.800]  watch your children die because I've studied in the rat studies and others
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:59.200]  that they've sprayed aluminum on them they've done everything there they've
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:03.880]  already tested it on roads because their life cycles quicker they can get them
[02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:08.400]  deeper and I know exactly what's in store for us in fact I made projections in
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:11.640]  my mind years ago on this went and checked the research that I knew was
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:16.040]  already out there and my analysis was dead on that's what I do I thin slice
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:22.160]  intelligence what they call it I have actually a sickening gift for it it's
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:26.520]  torture because everything I look at I basically understand that I know it and
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:29.880]  I can't handle it it's really hard it's really hard look at this stuff because
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:33.040]  I've already looked at it all and it makes me sick when I look at it again
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:36.960]  because I can't get the word out to people I can't stop these people I just
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:41.080]  you got to be strong folks and take action yourselves I mean I read them
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:46.120]  rolling out the geoengineering the spray in us with radioactive isotopes
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:54.280]  barium aluminum dioxide radium and I every time I turn on the history
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:57.040]  channel or discovery channel or something they're like going we could spray
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:01.360]  the skies to protect the earth we could and I already know they had a Nobel
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.760]  Prize for it in the early 90s they were testing it since the 60s they went
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:10.240]  global in the 90s they're killing us they're killing the insects I mean we're
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:16.800]  being murdered and I've got friends that do TV shows about it and make fun of me
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:19.960]  and once they've said that it isn't real and isn't happening they're never
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:25.480]  gonna go back and say it didn't happen because they go and they show kooks that
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:29.040]  think every airplane spraying something or they think an ice you know sure
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:34.320]  there's an extreme that you know thinks stuff's going on that isn't but why
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:37.520]  would there be a whacked-out extreme when crazy stuff's going on when the
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:40.600]  system's crazy and evil what do you think the people are going to be like
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:44.400]  they're gonna be all different flavors of nuts
[02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:54.320]  but here's the BBC geoengineering climate fixes could harm billions and
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:29:01.120]  the article admits that what they spray in in their proposed climate fixes which
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:04.480]  is exactly what we catch them spraying see they tell you it's coming when it's
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:08.920]  already here they tell you they're gonna bring in 10,000 serians when there's
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:16.200]  already 2 million here that's right 2 million in the last five years and then
[02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:19.000]  it's kind of actually slowed down only 200 something thousands in the last year
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.680]  or so but here it is geoengineering climate fixes could harm billions now
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:27.080]  we're gonna come back that's BBC folks may have heard of that with them
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:31.840]  announcing oh we're gonna do it oh guess what was in the climate agreement
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:36.000]  let's quote non-binding from Paris but still they just do it guess what's in it
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:46.200]  oh legalizing weather warfare oh they they repealed the 1978 UN Act get ready
[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:50.360]  folks they're coming after everybody we're on the March the Empire they're
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:56.800]  about to intensify spraying Alex Joe's get ready it is gonna be bad

[02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:22.920]  talk to him every day and that's why the globalist
[02:33:22.920 --> 02:33:29.920]  what do you mean I don't support your system
[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:35.920]  what do you mean I can't get to work on time
[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:40.920]  guys I forgot a water you might bring me going in thank you
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:45.920]  if there's a new way
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:49.920]  there's a new way well the cheer in Bernie Sanders
[02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:52.920]  I'll be the first in line
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:34:00.920]  I'm gonna get into the geoengineering here and then your phone calls and then the other news that I haven't hit yet
[02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:08.920]  what do you mean I don't know how to get Dave Mustaine back on the show you know I could but all hell broke loose last time he was on
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:12.920]  same thing with everybody else that's famous that comes on the show people call up and threaten them
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:20.920]  and then try to take things away from them that's the real intimidation that goes on within the system
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:26.920]  MSNBC's Brzezinski white men with guns greater threat than ISIS
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:31.920]  that's a great headline actually that is exactly what's happening
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:37.920]  Paul Watson wrote a story MSNBC host responds to criticism of radical Islam by blaming white men with guns
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:42.920]  two different articles upon info wars dot com
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:51.920]  drugreport.com is linked to one of our stories where the radical Islamists are saying video after video we're coming to get your women
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:35:02.920]  culture we're coming to spread Islam you will submit basically
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:12.920]  I'm gonna get back into the geoengineering here in a moment and I'm gonna do a produce report in the new year but now's the time
[02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:20.920]  I do it now I do it today but this is kind of a dead zone media wise in the year when the reports we put out don't have as big an effect
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:27.920]  you can decide to share reports even more and get more aggressive and that won't be the case but for media in general this is a sluggish time
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:36.920]  it's such a big deal to have Seymour Hirsch come out and say okay I've talked to top generals they're actually feeding Assad info to stop Obama
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:43.920]  and the neocons from putting Al Qaeda in charge I mean I knew a lot of that was going on but whoa that's big
[02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:50.920]  I will do a special report on that after the show today for the nightly news seven o'clock Central
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:36:00.920]  and then to have this geoengineering come out in a whole bunch of articles kind of like you wake up and there's 30 40 different journalists syndicated columnist
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:09.920]  Rachel Maddow alone 300 plus was pushing 400 articles attacking me last week was one story she wrote but it was in
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:18.920]  hundreds of major newspapers it was in the local paper people that I knew came up me about it they said you didn't say there's
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:28.920]  again big giant wasp under the U.N. building I mean they know but people that don't actually believe I'm a raving loon
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:35.920]  and then again this weekend there's suddenly articles everywhere hey geoengineering is going on with the jet trails did you know oh it's an accident
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:41.920]  but oh they just signed a treaty last week legalizing it oh that's why we just now told you about it
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:53.920]  and then oh yeah they kind of knew before putting it in the fuel yeah it's a little toxic to people but it's for the earth
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:58.920]  that's what I'm reading here I mean it's just like the way they play the public and now I'm gonna have to have people
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:05.920]  that grocery stores and stuff because I'm you know make fun of me oh or the jet spring me or the black helicopters coming to get me
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:12.920]  that's what I was here or are the aliens gonna get me or the black helicopters or the or the or the wasp people you know the few folks
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:19.920]  I'll be in a restaurant so I walk over and knock my glass over and go shame on you racist or are the aliens gonna get me
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:29.920]  oh you know something like that I just laugh back at them and now I hear I'm going of course there's some geoengineering
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:39.920]  you're not one of the people that revolutionary exposed it all you're a cook cuz it's true you get a black eye because you were right
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:51.920]  you're even funnier and I don't get mad at those people because they're making fun of me I get mad at the globalists
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:58.920]  that they've programmed them and jacked their brain so hard that subconsciously they're terrified of the truth and so they've got this emotional
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:09.920]  sav this emotional cream where they say everything's okay and that I'm a cook I'm a liar you're a cook you're a liar so everything's okay
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:17.920]  oh Donald Trump you're the reason there's ISIS oh really I thought Hillary funded them and helped them rise that's what Trump said back
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:25.920]  and then she just shakes devastated I control reality I'm history's actor I say what is reality
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:33.920]  because I look like a drugged out dying witch or something it's all bow down to this blob that they shove at us
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:54.920]  this gibbering arrogant blob that talks to us like we're elementary students hello children today in first grade class we're going to practice how to line up to go to the bathroom
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:39:04.920]  that's what NPR sounds like for a bunch of pseudo-foppish intellectuals to listen to and to think about how intellectual they are
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:14.920]  they're about as intellectual as a dead dog in the street with its eyes rotted out with fire ants calling all over it
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:23.920]  bunch of fake cowardly people who wish they were dead already well here's the deal I'm not dead my family's not dead and we're not rolling over
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:27.920]  so you may get the majority of people drooling I know what planet they're on
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:33.920]  I'm not it and my listeners aren't it and we see you and we know who you are filth
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:42.920]  briefly before I get back into the beginning as we told you was coming oh we just legalized spraying you oh it might be a little poisonous
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:55.920]  oh accidently we were doing it oh I mean oh but oh sci-fi channels on the night or oh there's some science fiction movies we can go watch they're so exciting
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:09.920]  we can watch Recycled R2-D2 for the 50 millionth time oh I'll show graphics of foreign planets oh but forget huge programs with them spraying you and your family to slowly kill you
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:19.920]  it's no big deal it's fine in fact I shouldn't even be upset about it I I apologize actually I feel like a coward and a piece of filth that I still do enjoy my life
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:26.920]  and I still go out and have fun knowing all this I look at all the zombies and feel sorry for them but then I realize I'm not meant to fight a total takeover like this
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:35.920]  humans are meant to fight pretty much a frontal assault and so I've learned to not go crazy and just understand it's all part of a larger plan in God's view
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:43.920]  and that and then I can just try to turn it off now and still be a person knowing all this so I know why the average person doesn't want to believe any of this
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:49.920]  or doesn't want to check what I'm saying it doesn't want to go look into it because then you'd have to actually do something about it when you find out it was true
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:41:03.920]  and people don't like to feel small and it makes you kind of feel small when you learn that you're living in a science fiction attempt to bring us into an end of days dystopia that could only come out of the mind of the devil
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:13.920]  I get it you want to go to your church and hear that you're all fine about to get raptured and feel good about yourselves and feel secure and you know you're kind of scared deep down
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:20.920]  but when you get close to God and maybe that God will protect you God isn't going to protect anybody doesn't put their skin on the line
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:30.920]  God isn't going to give you providence isn't going to give you any of the gifts you've got to use if you don't put your butt on that line
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:37.920]  and that's the way the universe works and I feel sorry for you people I want you to break your conditioning and I want you to get involved and I want you to understand what's happening
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:48.920]  I'm not talking to our amazing audience that's awakened on fire I'm talking to the new listeners that tune in by the tens of thousands every few minutes to this broadcast
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:55.920]  I know with the liberals and the trendies and the hipsters that my show is very popular as a form of entertainment
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:42:05.920]  oh it'll be very entertaining till you get diagnosed with cancer at 30 it's going to be real entertaining when your girlfriend gets that tetanus shot and dies a day later
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:16.920]  and the hospital says no connection it's going to be real funny when you have a little kid and they're three years old and get cancer and you go research the cancer numbers and find out they're over 10,000% up since 1950 and children
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:27.920]  it's going to get real funny isn't it because it's not funny it's real
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:39.920]  briefly we found this operation with high quality products that won't protect you from a lot of what's going on that just might make you feel a little bit better and be a little bit healthier on your bounce to the bottom under globalist annihilation
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:48.920]  everything we put out use bonafide to knock your socks off that's that's the only thing I promote let's put this under your time I just like to mix up like my own little coca-cola basically
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:43:01.920]  couple squirts supermail vitality I forgot to take this yesterday I'm going to take a little bit more today I could tell I was dragging a little bit today I forgot to take my brain force because I ran out of the bottle at the house
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:19.920]  so I forgot to take that this morning so I put some supermail in there I put some survival shield x2 nasa nine nine in there I have been taking this judiciously and some other stuff but I'm put some deep cleanse in here one on
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:40.920]  I got some other stuff just mix it all in there together and then I'm going to slurp this baby back and that's what I do and if you get supermail and if you get x2 and you take it for a month if you don't feel big effects I'll eat my head
[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:55.920]  there's a reason with the herb Nazis I mean that in a nice way like the soup Nazis and with the you know big third party sites were 4.8 stars and nobody else has got that it's because we know a we're going to be under attack
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:44:10.920]  B we're going to be under super scrutiny C we want to promote really good products or high-quality folks will like them I want to buy them again A B or C none of them are number one is just these are in order here and these are game changers I mean they really are
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:21.920]  you take x2 for about two three weeks though when you've been toxic you will probably feel like crap for a week the third or fourth week and then after you people go through that that it feels like you were carrying one of your kids on your
[02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:32.920]  shoulders up a hill when you take them off you feel like you're flying that's kind of what happens when I've always been a maniac I've always been crazed I've always been aggressive I've always been bouncing off the walls
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:43.920]  this stuff made me feel like I was 20 years old again and it's all available still discounted the free ship against tomorrow it will end they just haven't taken it down yet but the specials are going to go now to the end of the year

[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:55.920]  all right let me just finish up briefly with Kim Trails and then I'm gonna go to Joshua who points out Hillary has killed journalist oh yeah a lot of Arkansas my god that is funny
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:46:07.920]  Putin kills journalists that's that's a funny one I mean he may have Putin doesn't need to kill journalists just like the Clintons don't need to things just happen to people
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:18.920]  and yeah when Putin was fighting the Rothschilds it's come out in court ticking their people out some of them did fall down
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:28.920]  and I'm not endorsing all of that but you can't prove Putin did it with Hillary it was people like Vince Foster and newspaper people in Arkansas and the persecution of the press
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:34.920]  I mean it's come out in their own Clinton papers their persecution of the press
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:42.920]  but I digress I'll just have to do a special report on this I've already pretty much covered it they're just rolling it out now they're making it public
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:57.920]  that oh my goodness jet fuel happens to create nuclei in the atmosphere and always different altitudes and is causing these artificial cloud banks that are shielding light that's coming in and bouncing it back into space is it helping global warming or hurting
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:03.920]  well most studies say it actually shoots through the ultra violent then it doesn't bounce back up and it actually is heating the earth
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:10.920]  so they're trying to stop an ice age knowing it'll kind of overheat us a little bit then they go oh my god look we're hot let you know pay us money
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:18.920]  now we're talking about geoengineering taxes to save the earth they admit the earth is 20 to 30% darker depending on which time of year you measure it
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:26.920]  and that's because of geoengineering and the BBC again asked the question we've always said it's going on it's secret boy shouldn't it be public if it's so loving
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:35.920]  and they just say oh no none of that exist geoengineering climate fixes could harm billions
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:50.920]  billions and then they go through all these metals that they're calling for spraying aluminum dioxide barium salts also things it could hurt humans
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:58.920]  and this is all they also about weather patterns changing can kill us well yeah it is weather weapons
[02:47:58.920 --> 02:48:04.920]  and then how do you counter when I'm exposing weather weapons and the declassified patents and the father weather weapons coming on my show
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:12.920]  these all over CNN and Fox News the next week they just go oh Alex says Obama sent that tornado to Oklahoma City never said it
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:21.920]  I told the lady I didn't think that was what happened but that's how they invert truth like that another article right here south of the Daily Beast today
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:31.920]  conspiracy theorists terrorize our town info wars worst humans invade Texas we invaded Texas because I live here plus we weren't there every word is a lie
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:39.920]  info wars wasn't there we're not the worst humans ever we didn't invade Texas
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:52.920]  they teach them in these disinfo schools how to just create a tissue of hate and disdain a 10 minutes of hate every word is a lie about how with how they set it next to it
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:49:05.920]  conspiracy theorists so first they say these people you don't listen to they ask questions their heretics so conspiracy theorists terrorized our town so then I terrorized the town that
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:14.920]  well the county named after Colonel Travis who my family raised his son and my family was involved in both sides founding Texas see I've now invaded Texas
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:31.920]  I'm now hurting it I'm a carpet bagger just everything they say pure deception let's continue I'm just reading one of the paragraphs here conspiracy theorists terrorized our town info wars worst humans invade Texas to stage a mass shooting
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:47.920]  we counter protested oh outnumbering them 20 to one oh see I had a protest I wasn't at I didn't put on wasn't there doesn't matter they defeated me 20 to one like I'm a pinniana they still don't believe Sandy Hook ever happened
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:59.920]  so they had that little end that we're saying there's discrepancies the official story doesn't fit the mock mass shooters who tried to terrorize the University of Texas at Austin were no ordinary second amendment advocates it turns out they were far right
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:13.920]  conspiracy theorists who believe that other mass shootings most notoriously Sandy Hook shooting were hoaxes perpetrated by paid crisis actors now why is this out this week because they wrote a thousand plus articles last week saying that I attack the families
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:27.920]  of Sandy Hook people when I don't do that more strong so this is just all part of the directive that goes out they took to the streets last Saturday to terrorize our community I'm reading into believing that by showing the gruesome violence of the stage mass shooting
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:39.920]  replete with fake blood and all citizens somehow should be armed with assault rifles and then it just goes on where's Alex where is he where is he where am I
[02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:49.920]  and it goes it all started on Facebook just just nothing and we had a story talking about the demonstration coming up that's it so so so this is how they do it
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:59.920]  they they have other people go out and then they misrepresent what we actually did stay with us

[02:54:46.920 --> 02:55:01.920]  you say that see these are known liars don't believe a word they say is the point they are just gutless criminals who won't have jobs soon anyways their whole systems dying this is their death rattle

[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:45.920]  Hey Alex thanks for taking my call I have more comment really than anything in the comment that I wanted to make was Hillary Clinton really should be careful stone stones and glass houses I mean look at Vince Foster Britt Hume's son I mean and not to mention I'm sure
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:49.920]  But she's stunning and brave and she was like Brian Williams in combat
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:54.920]  No she's a fraud and a liar and what she is and she belongs to prison
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:58.920]  Buddy that's hate speech according to Facebook you just said something bad about a woman boy
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:04.920]  Oh well then I guess they're just going to have to report me and touch me oh oops they already do that
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:10.920]  No the great point I mean how many dead how many dead journalists behind the Clintons I mean this is a murder crew
[02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:15.920]  Oh yeah there's a lot of them but that was just the point that I wanted to make Alex
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:23.920]  God bless you really good points my friend let's talk to Trucker in Massachusetts I'm going to John in Texas Trucker
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:29.920]  Hey Alex peace cells I'm buying I've got a bunch under my tree and I hope you do too my friend
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:32.920]  You talking about boom booms?
[02:56:32.920 --> 02:56:39.920]  No I'm talking about the next death that you were playing before peace cells and who's buying and I am buying
[02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:47.920]  Well that's awesome absolutely well I remember listening to Megadeth and Junior High that very song so what's on your mind brother
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:55.920]  Alright listen I have been a registered independent since Ross Perot and I have always worn that with pride
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:57:02.920]  But there have been times like when I was living in Florida where I could not vote in the Republican primary because I was an independent
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:08.920]  So I am putting it out there and trying to urge all independent and libertarians
[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:17.920]  to want to get against the establishment to change their party affiliation to Republican at least through the primaries and caucuses
[02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:18.920]  Absolutely
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:21.920]  So we can vote and really stack the deck against them
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:27.920]  Exactly because the globalists have their full defense to block a Tea Party, Patriot takeover of the Republican Party
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:31.920]  That's their weakest point so we should obviously attack there
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:36.920]  I mean this is a war and we should everybody Democrats you name it if you're sick of this stuff folks
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:40.920]  You need to get in there and vote for Rand Paul Donald Trump you name it
[02:57:40.920 --> 02:57:45.920]  Anybody better than the mob boss Hillary Clinton I mean really Democrats are you really going to vote for somebody for the gimmick
[02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:51.920]  She's a woman when she wants World War 3 with Russia I mean this has got to stop
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:59.920]  Well I'm telling you when you have these polls where Trump is up by 27 points or whatever with registered Republicans
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:04.920]  Imagine if the registered independence and libertarians and Democrats
[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:09.920]  Exactly but imagine him in a debate he will eat her alive
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:16.920]  He will chew her up it will be all she needs is bravada that stand before me I'm a potbellied witch
[02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:22.920]  I can hardly talk or hardly stand everyone just falls down oh you're a woman oh you're a pal
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:26.920]  You brag about killing people you didn't physically kill what a witch
[02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:29.920]  You know you're so tough I mean he would just get in there and just annihilate her
[02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:34.920]  It would just be like King Kong attacking a legless pig or something
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:39.920]  Alright God bless you we'll be back with a fourth hour with Jakari Jackson but I'm going to take a few more calls

[03:00:58.920 --> 03:01:15.920]  Once you get to this point all the political injuries everything just becomes a numbing force where you just plunge through and crash through the enemy and don't even care
[03:01:15.920 --> 03:01:23.920]  Let's go to John in Texas John you're on the air God bless you thank you for calling the day Merry Christmas go ahead
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:31.920]  Thank you Alex you know a few days ago there was another website that had a picture of Angela Merkel as a teenager marching along in formation with her communist youth league uniform on
[03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:33.920]  mind looking as happy as all get out
[03:01:33.920 --> 03:01:38.920]  I've seen that before I mean tell me the website you saw it on
[03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:47.920]  Well we ought to put a link to that I've seen that I've seen that before yeah Merkel's parents were admittedly communist she's a horrible creature
[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:55.920]  And what ain't a lot of the other EU members supposedly former communist
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:02:00.920]  Good points are you saying Putin's really a communist I see that on the screen
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:14.920]  I don't know I like Donald Trump I'm slowly coming around Donald Trump and I'm slowly coming around a Vladimir Putin from from like Jesse being there and what he said and other things I've read on that I'm slowly coming around
[03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:19.920]  He really trying to build a America 1950s where I grew up in but he's trying to build
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:30.920]  Well that's actually what from the evidence Putin's doing I mean they literally are promoting men and women together they are promoting the family they're promoting women being strong men being strong they got tax incentives for it look here's the deal
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:46.920]  Russia's in shambles the globalists basically destroyed it they took it over and it you know what if there was a liberty coup against the KGB you know what if freedom was sexier than tyranny and I'm not saying Russia is either or
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:53.920]  Russia is at least fighting for its life America thinks it's on top and it's dead already
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:03:02.920]  Now politically we can rise like the phoenix but that's really what it comes down to brother we are the command base we're run by the new world order who hates us even more than Russia
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:10.920]  And Russia doesn't exist in the future world government situation they're going to double cross Russia with China top experts agree with me on that
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:19.920]  And it's not that Russia's perfect it's that the Russian elites have kicked the foreign oligarchs out the fellow reserve banks out
[03:03:19.920 --> 03:03:28.920]  The globalists put the Communist in for 80 years that fell it was kind of a stage deal the globalist had deals with their old leaders but they couldn't keep control
[03:03:28.920 --> 03:03:37.920]  New groups came in who at least set themselves up as the new oligarchs and threw out the foreign oligarchs so I don't romanticize the fact that you know everything's perfect over there but
[03:03:37.920 --> 03:03:50.920]  They got strong men over there that are actually about building the country up and if leaders weren't pure devil worshipers why wouldn't a strong man want to have a big strong powerful successful country
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:59.920]  That's more to skim off the top that's why the globalists are truly evil in that they just want to hurt prosperity and they want to hurt good people
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:08.920]  They want to come after our health our minds our souls that we ought to come in with jacarys intro with that song we want your soul I forget who did the song
[03:04:08.920 --> 03:04:17.920]  Nico Nico likes it he put it in there I like the song too because that's it Russia doesn't want to commit suicide and kill all its people
[03:04:17.920 --> 03:04:28.920]  Russia has like 1.6 birth rates was like 1.2 at the fall of the Soviet Union it was put in there to kill the Russians to give them back in leaders to make them desperate to destroy their dreams
[03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:38.920]  They never had freedom under the czars and they went from one tyranny to something five times worse so Russia's fighting for its soul right now so they got George Soros over there
[03:04:38.920 --> 03:04:46.920]  Trying to give them modern hippie-dippy liberalism he's like we'll give you freedom we'll teach your five year olds how to give a blow job excuse my French
[03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:57.920]  And Putin them said you know what keep that over there you Nazi collaborator you crawl in your hole and you die so the media all yells and screams they're trying to overthrow Putin that's what's going on
[03:04:57.920 --> 03:05:05.920]  Assyrian refugee admitted his main goal is not to escape war or ISIS persecution but to convert Europeans to Islam he said quote
[03:05:05.920 --> 03:05:17.920]  My main goal for leaving Assyria is to lead the people to the acceptance of Islam I swear by Allah that I only came here for this one goal I have observed that they are curious and willing to get to know Islam through us
[03:05:17.920 --> 03:05:29.920]  This is not the only one influential shit recently gave a speech in which to encourage radical Muslims to use the migrant crisis to quote breed with Europeans and conquer their countries but this modern day Islamic conquest is not just happening only in Europe
[03:05:29.920 --> 03:05:38.920]  During the US radical Muslims are building their own Islamic compounds and communities while telling Christians and other non-Muslims to keep out and these communities are rapidly expanding
[03:05:38.920 --> 03:05:53.920]  In fact the Obama administration has admitted nearly 400 Syrian refugees into the US and see November 13th Paris attacks and only one of them is a Christian but Christians comprise about 10% of the population in Syria so why isn't the Obama administration allowing more Christian refugees into the US

[03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:36.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm your host for this hour Jakari Jackson this is the Infowars Overdrive segment now coming up this hour we're going to talk about a lot of different things the daily beast is blaming Infowars.com for the mock mask shooting that happened a couple weeks ago at UT even though we had nothing to do with it
[03:08:36.920 --> 03:08:59.920]  Reporting on something in promoting it are two completely different things for example bless you Leanne, Leanne Mcadoos in studio over here I was saying promoting in reporting on an event are two completely different things for example a couple years ago I went out to South by Southwest after they had a guy driving the sidewalk and killed a bunch of different people
[03:08:59.920 --> 03:09:16.920]  Now people with any lick of common sense understand by my being there I was not encouraging anybody to go out and drive drunk and hit people on the sidewalk but when it comes to this thing like UT where Leanne went out there they're saying that she was promoting it and doing all these other things even though she was just telling people that it was going on
[03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:34.920]  but I digress I'm not going to get into it right at this moment also a woman in Vegas mowed down some people did a similar thing to what happened in South by Southwest and Lindsey Graham drops out of the presidential race and I'm sure we all are crying our eyes out because we cannot just blow up the universe to kill ISIS like Lindsey Graham wants to do
[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:55.920]  Now did we lose a caller guys because we had a caller who was holding for over an hour he dropped okay well you were just about to get on about that truth raider we I was about to go hot to you man that's all I was stalling for time but we see he dropped out so I guess we now can get into this Daily Beast article and we have the headline here Leanne you actually went out there and covered the event
[03:09:55.920 --> 03:10:17.920]  conspiracy theorists terrorized our town in four wars worse humans invaded Texas to stage a mass shooting we counter protested outnumbered them 20 to 1 and they still don't believe that Sandy Hook ever happened now first they they're saying that we promoted event we had nothing to do with we were actually criticized in some alternative media sites because we didn't promote it
[03:10:17.920 --> 03:10:34.920]  and now they just do this on the end that they still don't believe it Sandy Hook ever happened I'll go ahead and say on the record right now for the hacks of the Daily Beast I do believe people were shot and killed at Sandy Hook now there are some anomalies that I consider in the story whether the guy was going back and forth to his car to switch out his
[03:10:34.920 --> 03:10:48.920]  shot switch out a rifle for a shotgun how they called in a helicopter before they called in the they called important parties before they called in the helicopters and there's going on at the same time yeah and there's some there's some things about it that were odd to me but none of those things
[03:10:48.920 --> 03:11:03.920]  make me say that nobody died so right at Daily Beast you're just a bunch of hacks for putting that out there I don't believe the writer who did this article was actually the gentleman that was featured in my video yes so he this Andrew Dobbs he's the one that was putting on the mass farting
[03:11:03.920 --> 03:11:18.920]  drill the mass farting drill yes and I love this in here Leanne like they take another shot at us for Sandy Hook and all this stuff and then the guy the author of the gentleman she spoke to in the video he is so proud he put this in here
[03:11:18.920 --> 03:11:31.920]  he's talking about info wars comes out here and they they're promoting this event blah blah blah and we farted in their faces he actually put this here I don't know if you guys got the dock and whatever and we farted in their faces now Leanne you were there did anybody fart in your face
[03:11:31.920 --> 03:11:48.920]  nobody farted in my face now that we've established that nobody ever farted in somebody's face whipping a dildo around going yeah so now we've established that even if they did fart in somebody's faces I cannot just I cannot fathom a grown man taking so much pride in
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:12:03.920]  fighting in somebody's faces like if I was attacked by ISIS and I beat them down if I beat up like 10 ISIS jihadis with my bare hands right like straight up Rambo and I wouldn't drop down and fart in somebody's face because grown men don't do that and there's
[03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:19.920]  nothing I want to point out here in this article and even though we were there and they admit in the article that there were reporters from every major news network and major national daily newspaper and even the notorious conspiracy news site info wars owned by local
[03:12:19.920 --> 03:12:31.920]  Austinite Alex Jones so even though there were multiple people there from multiple agencies who all reported on the same thing are being there in the in the author's eyes is our promoting or hosting the event right
[03:12:31.920 --> 03:12:41.920]  so I I mean I obviously went on Twitter and said look man your research team sucks because we had nothing to do with this and if you actually go and find out you know who was promoting that event
[03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:54.920]  they were upset that we didn't cover didn't go and cover this and you know of course you didn't apologize I'm sure there will be no retraction issues oh no that's the point of just showing how easily you'll have these
[03:12:54.920 --> 03:13:05.920]  entities in the media out there that'll just print whatever they want issue no retraction don't clear anything up and even though info wars didn't have anything to do with it they'll just racial matter will come out and say that
[03:13:05.920 --> 03:13:14.920]  Alex said wasps live under the White House so it doesn't matter they'll report whatever. Yeah and I don't want to spend all day on this because I know you got some other news but I want to go to this last point I have here guys of me we can do the
[03:13:14.920 --> 03:13:25.920]  doc cam he says I had a hard time believing that these guys had spent weeks stringing the media long only to do the main event at a time in place where the media would not or the media would miss it.
[03:13:25.920 --> 03:13:36.920]  Now so this is my challenge to the Daily Beast or anybody who chooses to criticize us about this you know whether it be you know MSNBC or anybody else if we spend weeks planning this event I want you to go back and document
[03:13:36.920 --> 03:13:45.920]  on the info wars nightly news to special reports the Alex Jones show us promoting this event the only thing you will find is a hot topic a little news thing that Leigh Ann did about it.
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:56.920]  Once again it was not promoting the event it was just a new segment saying that it was happening they did the same thing on Fox and on any number of these newspapers or other things they just said it was going on that was in no way shape or form a
[03:13:56.920 --> 03:14:09.920]  promotion of the event so there is your task. Well and we specifically you know I asked you about it because the Second Amendment that's your beat you know and I wanted to know if you were going to be out there covering it and I really didn't know who was putting it on I had no issue with it
[03:14:09.920 --> 03:14:22.920]  either way I just thought the news story would be that there are going to be people protesting with fart blasters and sexual implements right. To me that that was more of the story.
[03:14:22.920 --> 03:14:34.920]  But then once I was out there I ran into Michael Cargill who was so upset that this event was put he actually went to this event specifically to go and speak to people about what campus carry was really about it had.
[03:14:34.920 --> 03:14:47.920]  It has already been passed and people work tirelessly to get it passed and he felt that this was making a huge mockery of the people who were trying to get campus carry past because it has nothing to do with arming your average Joe.
[03:14:47.920 --> 03:14:56.920]  So that he can take out a mass shooter at a school it was about self defense and protecting yourself because as you know Michael Cargill has a personal story with that yes.
[03:14:56.920 --> 03:15:08.920]  Okay so that's all the time I'm going to spend on that but once again to anybody who wants to demonize us further for this event please go through and find all these non-existent clips and find some way to blame it for us as well.
[03:15:08.920 --> 03:15:12.920]  All right now Leon I got a lot of news but I know you also have some news as well.
[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:23.920]  Yes well the top of the judge today was how Obama was pulling the race card with Trump and basically accusing Trump of exploiting working class fears.
[03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:40.920]  And this was in a radio interview at aired Monday night and he said that the Republicans are basically playing on blue collar workers fears and you know because of the trouble in the economy that they've had and everything and so they're just really upset about how they're going to
[03:15:40.920 --> 03:15:43.920]  pay their rent and everything like that.
[03:15:43.920 --> 03:15:55.920]  Well the real threat that isn't even an exploitation of fears it's an actual exploitation of the American people is this omnibus bill that was majority you know this was like the big Christmas present to the Democrats.
[03:15:55.920 --> 03:16:09.920]  This is what's really going to affect blue collar workers everyone because it's going to triple the amount of H2B visa visas that are given and these are not the tech workers that's the H1B visa this is H2.
[03:16:09.920 --> 03:16:20.920]  These people are exclusively brought in to fill blue collar jobs non farm jobs hotels restaurants construction truck driving and many other occupations that millions of Americans would love to do.
[03:16:20.920 --> 03:16:32.920]  So here this is the same thing whereas the media just comes out accusing one group of doing something when they're the ones that are actually wrecking and really truly threatening blue collar workers.
[03:16:32.920 --> 03:16:44.920]  Yeah and you know people know I'm not on the Trump campaign I'm not a supporter of his but when you want to talk about Obama coming after Trump as far as I know Trump has never promised a black woman a house and they never gave it to her.
[03:16:44.920 --> 03:16:48.920]  So you got that on your on your thing to get over first Mr Obama.
[03:16:48.920 --> 03:16:58.920]  Well and also to Obama pulled the race card and said that you know it probably a lot of people are really they were voting for Trump and upset because he's the first African American president.
[03:16:58.920 --> 03:17:03.920]  He's basically saying that the Republicans are people who support Trump or whatever are just racist.
[03:17:03.920 --> 03:17:16.920]  Meanwhile if you look at the GOP the candidates I mean up until just about a month ago Ben Carson was at the top so clearly Republicans are not afraid of having another black president.
[03:17:16.920 --> 03:17:30.920]  Yeah he had some controversy you know Carson did and that definitely took him down in the polls but you know he was up there even at a point I think they're kind of teasing maybe a Trump Carson ticket you know I'm not sure where that is now but that was at least mentioned at one point.
[03:17:30.920 --> 03:17:37.920]  Right so that that right there is just like you can't pull the race card you can't say that Republicans are anti women there's a woman there running.
[03:17:37.920 --> 03:17:52.920]  So I just it's ridiculous and once again it's just if people don't go and do their research and see if there's a counter argument they're just going to run with whatever is being pushed out there whatever narratives being said oh well the GOP is racist and they hate the first black
[03:17:52.920 --> 03:17:55.920]  American president and it's just not true.
[03:17:55.920 --> 03:18:08.920]  Yeah well there's a running joke that Clinton was the first black president. I guess that's a whole nother thing. What else do you have. Well speaking of Clinton and you know just more lies if you don't do your own research.
[03:18:08.920 --> 03:18:21.920]  So in this Democratic debate Clinton Hillary Clinton made this claim that ISIS is using videos of Donald Trump to recruit and she said he is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
[03:18:21.920 --> 03:18:27.920]  Well of course people dug around and they're like well Donald Trump isn't in any ISIS recruitment videos but guess who is.
[03:18:27.920 --> 03:18:28.920]  Oh.
[03:18:28.920 --> 03:18:29.920]  Bill Clinton.
[03:18:29.920 --> 03:18:30.920]  Oh.
[03:18:30.920 --> 03:18:31.920]  Bill Clinton.
[03:18:31.920 --> 03:18:32.920]  Slick Willy.
[03:18:32.920 --> 03:18:45.920]  Well slick Willy is in ISIS videos being labeled as a fornicator. So he is actually being used to recruit for ISIS by saying look at how messed up America is they got the one president who's a fornicator.
[03:18:45.920 --> 03:18:52.920]  President Obama and George W. Bush are also in it. They're liars. They have an ineffectual military.
[03:18:52.920 --> 03:18:53.920]  So.
[03:18:53.920 --> 03:19:02.920]  So just I mean I'm not vouching for Trump or anything but the simple fact that he could have possibly been in one was enough for her to come out and attack him on it.
[03:19:02.920 --> 03:19:11.920]  Even though she has the whole Benghazi scandal which nobody wants to talk about. Everybody wants to talk about the emails but we've seen Ambassador Stephen sending the cables months before his death and then leading up to his death.
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:17.920]  They didn't give him more security. They took security away while she's out you know signing autographs at you know female colleges and all that stuff.
[03:19:17.920 --> 03:19:18.920]  Now there's anything wrong with that.
[03:19:18.920 --> 03:19:22.920]  What I'm saying you need to do you do diligence and make sure that you guys don't die.
[03:19:22.920 --> 03:19:31.920]  Well exactly and she was asked about Libya. It came up in this debate as well but she dodged that question twice and she kind of threw it back.
[03:19:31.920 --> 03:19:34.920]  Well Sanders you voted for regime change as well.
[03:19:34.920 --> 03:19:44.920]  And you know a lot of those people probably voted for that on her word because she was the secretary of state at the time probably saying this is what needs to happen and laughed.
[03:19:44.920 --> 03:19:46.920]  Of course we came we saw he died.
[03:19:46.920 --> 03:19:47.920]  Yeah in Turkey.
[03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:48.920]  Thank you.
[03:19:48.920 --> 03:19:50.920]  Thank you so much Leanne.

[03:24:53.920 --> 03:25:03.920]  And this is the last day for free shipping. Now I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about the horrific tragedy this past weekend in Las Vegas, where a motorist decided to drive on the sidewalk.
[03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:09.920]  We have reports of one dead, 37 injured. And you know, many of those people in the hospital, they could slip away potentially.
[03:25:09.920 --> 03:25:18.920]  37 injured after a car plows into a crowd in Las Vegas. Let's go ahead and run this clip and then we'll come back with some commentary.
[03:25:18.920 --> 03:25:27.920]  This is a huge tragedy that has occurred on our strip. Breaking overnight, a massive and deadly hit and run on the famous Las Vegas strip.
[03:25:27.920 --> 03:25:31.920]  We have determined that this is an intentional act.
[03:25:31.920 --> 03:25:46.920]  Police say a female driver in her 20s ran her vehicle up onto the sidewalk, bustling with tourists, twice, possibly three times, plowing into nearly 40 people between Planet Hollywood and Paris Resort and Casino.
[03:25:46.920 --> 03:25:52.920]  The fatal incident unfolding while the Miss Universe pageant was underway inside Planet Hollywood.
[03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:57.920]  She is in the detention center right now. She's speaking to detectives.
[03:25:57.920 --> 03:26:05.920]  The suspect, speeding off with a three-year-old toddler inside, was quickly apprehended by police less than a mile away.
[03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:11.920]  Investigators believe she's not a Las Vegas native, but say this is not an act of terrorism.
[03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:16.920]  So it's very interesting to me and it really shows you the state of the world, how this event can happen.
[03:26:16.920 --> 03:26:23.920]  But the only thing that I see on the news today, if I go to the news aggregates, is how Steve Harvey messed up the name of one of the participants.
[03:26:23.920 --> 03:26:26.920]  Nothing against Steve, like his comedy and all that stuff.
[03:26:26.920 --> 03:26:30.920]  But you have 37 people injured one day and they just want to talk about the Miss Universe pageant.
[03:26:30.920 --> 03:26:33.920]  No, this is a much more important story.
[03:26:33.920 --> 03:26:42.920]  And as I alluded to earlier in our broadcast, these things happened here in Austin. South by Southwest, a guy was fleeing from the Austin Police Department.
[03:26:42.920 --> 03:26:47.920]  He decided to drive on the sidewalk. I believe hit 20 or so people, many of whom died.
[03:26:47.920 --> 03:26:53.920]  And when we have horrible incidents like this, people, they really want to figure out what the root of the problem is.
[03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:58.920]  Nobody's going to call the band cars, or at least nobody with common sense is going to call the band cars.
[03:26:58.920 --> 03:27:04.920]  I understand this is an immensely disturbed individual. They took these actions upon themselves and they need to be held accountable for it.
[03:27:04.920 --> 03:27:08.920]  It wasn't a car's fault. It wasn't anybody else's fault except for the driver.
[03:27:08.920 --> 03:27:16.920]  Now I do believe we have testimony from one of the bystanders. A gentleman was out there and he saw the whole thing happen and he has some words to say about it.
[03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:24.920]  A Buick, Oldsmobile type car, a tan, maybe silver, it starts just mowing through people.
[03:27:24.920 --> 03:27:32.920]  And people are flying and yelling at it. And the windows crashed out on the front of the car, mainly just mowing through.
[03:27:32.920 --> 03:27:38.920]  Like what I saw was like children because the kids weren't moving. They didn't get out of the way.
[03:27:38.920 --> 03:27:44.920]  And then the car proceeded to go past us right in front of us through the people.
[03:27:44.920 --> 03:27:49.920]  And then off to the right, I look and it's going toward like a truck or something.
[03:27:49.920 --> 03:28:01.920]  That's pulling out of right past Monami Gaby, which is in front of Paris. And the car proceeded to slow down, veer around it, and then accelerate again into the people on the sidewalk.
[03:28:01.920 --> 03:28:05.920]  So there's absolutely no question in your mind that the driver in that car was trying to hit people.
[03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:10.920]  Yeah, just like as the commentator is saying, there definitely seems that this was an intentional act.
[03:28:10.920 --> 03:28:15.920]  At this point, they don't want to call it a act of terrorism. Like I said, I don't know too much about the person.
[03:28:15.920 --> 03:28:20.920]  At this point, I believe they were going to arraign her today. So maybe there are some additional reports.
[03:28:20.920 --> 03:28:31.920]  But yeah, you know, these horrible things happen and, you know, answer isn't ban this ban that, you know, banning whatever wouldn't have stopped this lady from doing what she chose to do in this very unfortunate incident.
[03:28:31.920 --> 03:28:38.920]  Now, with the time we have on talk about Lindsey Graham, Lindsey Graham, I'm sure he's your favorite presidential candidate.
[03:28:38.920 --> 03:28:46.920]  I know David Knight loves him some Lindsey Graham. This joke of David hates Lindsey Graham with a very feverish passion.
[03:28:46.920 --> 03:28:57.920]  Lindsey Graham, the guy who wants to pretty much blow up the entire universe to rid the world of ISIS, has dropped out of the presidential campaign and I'm not shedding a single tear about it.
[03:28:57.920 --> 03:29:04.920]  Good riddance to you, Lindsey Graham. You can go back to doing whatever it is that you do as long as it's not being president of the United States.
[03:29:04.920 --> 03:29:09.920]  And it's not to say that I love the other contenders. You know, Lindsey is one of many contenders I don't like.
[03:29:09.920 --> 03:29:13.920]  I don't like Chris Christie talking so cavalier about shooting down Russian jets.
[03:29:13.920 --> 03:29:19.920]  He looks like I'm not up here apologizing for Putin or anything, but he's talking about shooting down jets like he's duck hunting or something.
[03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:26.920]  They're shooting skeet. Yeah, I'm just going to shoot them all down. You know, I'm Chris Christie. You know, I've never served a day in my life.
[03:29:26.920 --> 03:29:28.920]  I'm just going to start a war and put your kids at risk.
[03:29:28.920 --> 03:29:35.920]  So stay tuned after this break. We'll come back with a special report from John Bowne. We'll be taking your calls on any manner of subjects that you want to talk about.
[03:29:35.920 --> 03:29:58.920]  So stay tuned. This is the Alex Jones show. I'm your host, Cara Jackson, on the Info Wars Overdrive Hour.
[03:29:58.920 --> 03:30:07.920]  Thanks to the Federal Reserve System, America's economy is in a terminal decline. And according to economic expert Michael Snyder, here's eight facts that reveal just how bad the economy really is.
[03:30:07.920 --> 03:30:12.920]  Number one, majority of all American workers bring home less than $30,000 a year in wages.
[03:30:12.920 --> 03:30:17.920]  Number two, the poorest 40% of all Americans now spend most of their incomes just on food and housing.
[03:30:17.920 --> 03:30:23.920]  Number three, at least 50% of Americans who rent their homes spend more than a third of their incomes on the rent.
[03:30:23.920 --> 03:30:31.920]  Number four, incomes keep declining for a large majority of the US population. Number five, the price of ground beef has more than doubled since 2009.
[03:30:31.920 --> 03:30:39.920]  Number six, the rate of home ownership in the US has been declining for at least seven years in a row. It's now the lowest that has been in 20 years.
[03:30:39.920 --> 03:30:46.920]  Number seven, almost half of all Americans are not saving their money, and it's been estimated that 62% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[03:30:46.920 --> 03:30:56.920]  Number eight, one third of all Americans with student loans are currently behind on their student loan debt. Check out infowars.com for more economic news and also our new YouTube channel, Resistance News.

[03:33:23.920 --> 03:33:36.920]  A transgender father who abandoned his seven children to start a new life as a six year old girl is being celebrated by some liberals as a shining example of diversity.
[03:33:36.920 --> 03:33:47.920]  Stephanie Walsh is being profiled by numerous media outlets after she, Zee, revealed her story in a video interview for the transgender project.
[03:33:47.920 --> 03:33:55.920]  I can't deny I was married, I can't deny I have children, but I've moved forward now and I've gone back to being a child.
[03:33:55.920 --> 03:34:01.920]  I don't want to be an adult right now and I just live my life like I couldn't when I was in school.
[03:34:01.920 --> 03:34:08.920]  I have a mommy and daddy, an adopted mommy and daddy who are totally comfortable with me being a little girl.
[03:34:08.920 --> 03:34:20.920]  Walsh is now dressing up and pretending to be a six year old girl with her adopted family after being given an ultimatum by her ex-wife who said she had to stop being trans or leave.
[03:34:20.920 --> 03:34:31.920]  Walsh chose to abandon the 23 year marriage along with her seven kids and is now fulfilling her role as little sister to her new parents youngest granddaughter.
[03:34:31.920 --> 03:34:41.920]  The clip has received well over 160,000 views but feedback is overwhelmingly negative while comments have been completely disabled.
[03:34:41.920 --> 03:34:47.920]  Several liberals reacted by expressing support for Walsh and celebrating her story.
[03:34:47.920 --> 03:34:55.920]  Walsh herself reacted to critics by vowing to take on haters face to face at a location in Toronto.
[03:34:55.920 --> 03:35:01.920]  However, the vast majority of respondents to the independent article had a very different opinion.
[03:35:01.920 --> 03:35:06.920]  One writes, oh it's so great, what a hero, how brave, fawn, fawn.
[03:35:06.920 --> 03:35:12.920]  This is what happens when lunacy is championed by the right on. This is not news added another.
[03:35:12.920 --> 03:35:17.920]  This is a mentally ill person who does not need pandering to but needs psychiatric help.
[03:35:17.920 --> 03:35:22.920]  Another gay man accused Walsh of being an interloper and a fetishist.
[03:35:22.920 --> 03:35:30.920]  Another also made a number of accusations against Walsh that if true demolish her attempt at framing herself as a victim.
[03:35:30.920 --> 03:35:38.920]  The commenter writes, what this report doesn't tell you is that this person was charged with assault and abuse of his wife and family.
[03:35:38.920 --> 03:35:41.920]  They were awarded a restraining order against him.
[03:35:41.920 --> 03:35:45.920]  He has also been convicted of harassment and threatening a neighbor and a peeping Tom.
[03:35:45.920 --> 03:35:50.920]  Also his arrangement with his new mummy and daddy is a sexual one.
[03:35:50.920 --> 03:36:01.920]  It's also fascinating how many social justice warriors and feminists who would normally crucify a man for abandoning his wife and kids are extremely supportive of Walsh.
[03:36:01.920 --> 03:36:05.920]  Simply because she now professes to be a six year old girl.
[03:36:05.920 --> 03:36:13.920]  All kidding and paranoid transphobia aside, isn't this just sheer unabashed propaganda aimed at destroying the family?
[03:36:13.920 --> 03:36:14.920]  What's next?
[03:36:14.920 --> 03:36:23.920]  Probably the outspoken mentally ill or modern day left wing liberals will be glorifying the sad tale of Johnny List.
[03:36:23.920 --> 03:36:33.920]  A man who literally destroyed his family by patiently murdering them all because he had become recently unemployed and didn't want them to carry his burden.
[03:36:33.920 --> 03:36:36.920]  Rest assured, dead beat dads everywhere.
[03:36:36.920 --> 03:36:43.920]  All you have to do has become a twisted paragon of perversion and the left wing will carry you to victory.
[03:36:43.920 --> 03:36:46.920]  John Bowne for Enforce.com.
[03:36:46.920 --> 03:36:49.920]  Another great report from John Bowne.
[03:36:49.920 --> 03:36:56.920]  I had heard about that story but he dropped some things on me that I didn't know about it because it was always my thought.
[03:36:56.920 --> 03:37:08.920]  If the guy, even if you think it's great that he's a transgendered, if that's the proper word, a six year old girl, do you really want him to abandon his family and go live this life?
[03:37:08.920 --> 03:37:17.920]  John Bowne said that, I guess it's been reported that he had some domestic abuse issues but I think you'd still have to pay some type of child support or alimony or something to that regard.
[03:37:17.920 --> 03:37:20.920]  Alright, so we just went to a video so now we're going to take some of your calls.
[03:37:20.920 --> 03:37:22.920]  Now we're going to intersperse them going back and forth.
[03:37:22.920 --> 03:37:24.920]  We have Jeff in New York.
[03:37:24.920 --> 03:37:26.920]  You want to talk about geoengineering.
[03:37:26.920 --> 03:37:27.920]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[03:37:27.920 --> 03:37:47.920]  I, Sakari, have one thing, two things to say actually. First of all, a long-time listener, first-time caller, but there was a project that was done by an alternative medical practitioner's association out in Midwest in a specialized field where specialized zones were set up.
[03:37:47.920 --> 03:38:00.920]  It was a neutral area where a number of collection dishes were set up. The field was monitored for the 48-hour collection period and overhead is a major western flight path.
[03:38:00.920 --> 03:38:13.920]  So after 48 hours, the sterile collection bottles were collected and then these bottles were put through biochemical analyzers and what we found was absolutely horrific and terrifying.
[03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:27.920]  Human herpes virus 6, mycoplasma and pneumonia, barium, all these substances are not normal to being airborne that way and having a sterile collection environment.
[03:38:27.920 --> 03:38:36.920]  So to say that geoengineering is not happening is absolutely a force and certainly not true. We see it happen.
[03:38:36.920 --> 03:38:47.920]  All right, well, thank you so much, Jeff. Yeah, I know Alex is planning to do some more on this latest geoengineering report, not necessarily what you were talking about, but how some of these other agencies are now talking about.
[03:38:47.920 --> 03:38:54.920]  Thank you for calling, Jeff. All right, let's go now to Scott in Nebraska. You want to talk about MKUltra. Go ahead, Scott.
[03:38:54.920 --> 03:39:04.920]  Well, if you can make it up to Lincoln, Nebraska, I can give you the name and address of a guy that says he was MKUltra and they programmed him to go shoot up the school.
[03:39:04.920 --> 03:39:09.920]  They've also got a fusion center here. What school are you talking about?
[03:39:09.920 --> 03:39:14.920]  A school, just a regular school, elementary school or some sort.
[03:39:14.920 --> 03:39:18.920]  So you're saying he's planning to do this or what's going on here?
[03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:34.920]  No, I'm saying he was programmed to do this and I've got the guy's name that they shipped him basically to go shoot up the school and he ended up in a park someplace with his bread and five magazines full about ammo.
[03:39:34.920 --> 03:39:40.920]  All right, well, sir, it sounds like you may need to alert the proper authorities if you think he's going to go shoot up a school.
[03:39:40.920 --> 03:39:43.920]  I'm saying this happened about two years ago.
[03:39:43.920 --> 03:39:49.920]  Okay. All right, well, thank you so much, Scott. Let's move on now. We have Mike in Tennessee.
[03:39:49.920 --> 03:39:56.920]  You want to say, I guess you have the thought no one died at Sandy Hook. Go ahead.
[03:39:56.920 --> 03:39:59.920]  Go ahead, Mike in Tennessee.
[03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:07.920]  Okay, I guess we lost Mike in Tennessee in the headline there said that no one died in Sandy Hook. So I don't know if he was debating that or what his deal was.
[03:40:07.920 --> 03:40:16.920]  Let's talk to Mark in California. Before I go to you, Mark, let's get the number out again. It's 1-800-259-9231.
[03:40:16.920 --> 03:40:23.920]  Once again, it is 1-800-259-9231. Go ahead, Mark, in California.
[03:40:23.920 --> 03:40:31.920]  Speaking of numbers, do you have the telephone number for Formula Heart and Body Extract because they gave it out too fast?
[03:40:31.920 --> 03:40:38.920]  Oh, no, I'm sorry, sir. I think you're referring to one of the ads that run on the network. I don't have that number in front of me.
[03:40:38.920 --> 03:40:48.920]  Okay. Well, the reason why I called was there's a story here in San Jose that aired on October 29th.
[03:40:48.920 --> 03:40:55.920]  And I'm telling you, I'll never forget when Kennedy was killed when I was at our lady in Mount Carmel in first grade.
[03:40:55.920 --> 03:41:05.920]  I'll never forget 9-11 and I'll never forget Vicki Nguyen. When she aired that story on NBC, it's been 53 days, my brother.
[03:41:05.920 --> 03:41:12.920]  And it just, I've played it over and over. I went down to the board of supervisors here in San Jose.
[03:41:12.920 --> 03:41:23.920]  I've prayed and I will continue to pray that there was a four-year-old girl that was in a house, a fostered house in San Jose.
[03:41:23.920 --> 03:41:28.920]  And that poor mother had pictures of how she had been brutally beaten for five months.
[03:41:28.920 --> 03:41:32.920]  It took five months before finally they got that kid out of the house.
[03:41:32.920 --> 03:41:35.920]  And David Cortese, he says he's going to try and do something about it.
[03:41:35.920 --> 03:41:43.920]  But I, I'm just, we have a lot to pray about these days because I went down there Tuesday, as a matter of fact.
[03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:47.920]  And they know why I'm there. I'm there for this one issue.
[03:41:47.920 --> 03:41:53.920]  Okay. And I, there was only four speakers and he says, okay, there's only four speakers.
[03:41:53.920 --> 03:41:56.920]  We get three minutes a piece. The first lady gets three minutes.
[03:41:56.920 --> 03:42:04.920]  The second guy who talked about, as he put it, immigrants whose fears they have to be deported get six minutes.
[03:42:04.920 --> 03:42:09.920]  And so I get up there and I say, I mentioned this, the other guy got like about five minutes.
[03:42:09.920 --> 03:42:12.920]  And he says, you're eating away at your time.
[03:42:12.920 --> 03:42:20.920]  And he knew why I was there because I had my t-shirt on it says to Google Alex Jones and John DeCamp on the Franklin cover up,
[03:42:20.920 --> 03:42:24.920]  which is directly linked with this whole thing with this four year old girl.
[03:42:24.920 --> 03:42:31.920]  But it's a huge, huge story and I'm just hoping and praying that, you know, I called CBS or NBC rather on their tip line.
[03:42:31.920 --> 03:42:34.920]  They did call me back and they said, I know a man.
[03:42:34.920 --> 03:42:38.920]  I've got his number named Doug Millar who studied along these same lines.
[03:42:38.920 --> 03:42:44.920]  If Vicky Nguyen can interview Doug Millar, he, she will blow this whole thing out of the water.
[03:42:44.920 --> 03:42:49.920]  And they still haven't called Doug Millar, although I've given NBC their number.
[03:42:49.920 --> 03:42:52.920]  But he would be a great interview for you.
[03:42:52.920 --> 03:42:56.920]  Find folks there on Info Wars and tale of Y 1340 to interview.
[03:42:56.920 --> 03:42:58.920]  I mean, the guy is a certified hero.
[03:42:58.920 --> 03:43:04.920]  He passed out like 160 flyers outside the house of MK ultra Michael Aquino,
[03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:09.920]  who was the head of the National Security Agency, warning the neighbors up there in Leavenworth.
[03:43:09.920 --> 03:43:12.920]  I won't give his address for reasons.
[03:43:12.920 --> 03:43:18.920]  Well, just give us that stuff at show tips and info wars.com and we'll take a look at it.
[03:43:18.920 --> 03:43:20.920]  Thank you so much, Mark in California.
[03:43:20.920 --> 03:43:23.920]  Let's go ahead and take a look at another clip.
[03:43:23.920 --> 03:43:27.920]  We have this clip of Hillary Clinton that happened this past weekend on the debate.
[03:43:27.920 --> 03:43:32.920]  And people have been asking us why we didn't cover the Democrat debate.
[03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:37.920]  Well, they had it on a Saturday night before, before the Christmas weekend.
[03:43:37.920 --> 03:43:40.920]  Everybody has, you know, a lot of other things to do on the weekend.
[03:43:40.920 --> 03:43:43.920]  So I think it was rather strategically placed to be quite honest with you.
[03:43:43.920 --> 03:43:45.920]  You're going to have a Democratic debate.
[03:43:45.920 --> 03:43:49.920]  The weekend at Star Wars comes out and nobody's going to watch it in the first place.
[03:43:49.920 --> 03:43:53.920]  So a lot of people didn't see Mrs Clinton when she decided just to show up late to the debate.
[03:43:53.920 --> 03:43:57.920]  The guys are killing time, filling time, try to make up for her.
[03:43:57.920 --> 03:44:01.920]  She walks out and everybody's like, oh man, like she's like she's a rock star or something.
[03:44:01.920 --> 03:44:03.920]  Well, the big rock bands, they'll start the show late.
[03:44:03.920 --> 03:44:05.920]  It was somewhat like that.
[03:44:05.920 --> 03:44:09.920]  So if we have that clip, we can go ahead and play Mrs Clinton when she graced us with her presence.
[03:44:09.920 --> 03:44:12.920]  We have a packed audience here in New Hampshire and we're going to continue.
[03:44:12.920 --> 03:44:16.920]  We've already had a spirited conversation here at the top of the broadcast about ISIS,
[03:44:16.920 --> 03:44:19.920]  about the concerns of terror here on the home front.
[03:44:19.920 --> 03:44:24.920]  And as we await Secretary Clinton backstage here, we're going to begin on the economy.
[03:44:24.920 --> 03:44:29.920]  We want to turn to the American jobs, wages and raises in this country.
[03:44:29.920 --> 03:44:32.920]  And we believe Secretary Clinton will be coming around the corner any minute.
[03:44:32.920 --> 03:44:35.920]  But in the meantime, we want to start with this eye-opening number.
[03:44:35.920 --> 03:44:38.920]  And Senator Sanders, this question goes to you first anyway.
[03:44:38.920 --> 03:44:45.920]  In 1995, the median American household income was $52,600 in today's money.
[03:44:45.920 --> 03:44:48.920]  This year it's $53,600.
[03:44:48.920 --> 03:44:52.920]  That's 20 more years on the job with just a 2% raise.
[03:44:52.920 --> 03:44:56.920]  In a similar timeframe, raises for CEOs up more than 200%.
[03:44:56.920 --> 03:44:59.920]  Oh, here she is. She's walking on stage.
[03:44:59.920 --> 03:45:02.920]  Sorry.
[03:45:02.920 --> 03:45:03.920]  We're going to continue here.
[03:45:03.920 --> 03:45:04.920]  And Secretary, you'll get a chance on this too.
[03:45:04.920 --> 03:45:06.920]  Yeah, that's enough of that. That's enough of that.
[03:45:06.920 --> 03:45:10.920]  Once again, the number to call in is 800-259-9231.
[03:45:10.920 --> 03:45:13.920]  It is 800-259-9231.
[03:45:13.920 --> 03:45:17.920]  So there you see, there's kind of the hubris of these people.
[03:45:17.920 --> 03:45:19.920]  Like, yeah, I'll be there when I get there.
[03:45:19.920 --> 03:45:21.920]  Then we can just start the debate.
[03:45:21.920 --> 03:45:23.920]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Chase in Texas.
[03:45:23.920 --> 03:45:26.920]  You want to talk about the election? Go ahead, Chase.
[03:45:26.920 --> 03:45:28.920]  Thank you, sir.
[03:45:28.920 --> 03:45:31.920]  I kind of think that, you know, when it gets to Cleveland,
[03:45:31.920 --> 03:45:36.920]  if the will of the people choose whoever, if it's Trump or whoever,
[03:45:36.920 --> 03:45:39.920]  and Jeff's going to angle it and play this delegate thing,
[03:45:39.920 --> 03:45:44.920]  that could be possibly how they want to try to provoke some sort of an uprising.
[03:45:44.920 --> 03:45:46.920]  So I hope that doesn't happen.
[03:45:46.920 --> 03:45:50.920]  And as far as commenting, I mean,
[03:45:50.920 --> 03:45:54.920]  how do we know this woman is not fully healthy to be president?
[03:45:54.920 --> 03:45:56.920]  Let's talk about it, Clinton.
[03:45:56.920 --> 03:46:01.920]  Yeah, there's no way in the world that she should represent the people.
[03:46:01.920 --> 03:46:05.920]  I don't think, I mean, forget all the checkered past.
[03:46:05.920 --> 03:46:08.920]  I mean, she's medically not fit in my opinion.
[03:46:08.920 --> 03:46:10.920]  I mean, if she's suffering from incontinence,
[03:46:10.920 --> 03:46:14.920]  I come she can't get back to the podium in time because she's a woman.
[03:46:14.920 --> 03:46:15.920]  It's ridiculous.
[03:46:15.920 --> 03:46:20.920]  I think that either Jiblet Head, Jeb, or Argus at the top of a Dung Heap Clinton,
[03:46:20.920 --> 03:46:22.920]  we do not need any more in this country.
[03:46:22.920 --> 03:46:27.920]  To burn out hippies, baby boomers need to step aside and let the millennials,
[03:46:27.920 --> 03:46:29.920]  the youth, lead this nation.
[03:46:29.920 --> 03:46:31.920]  You know, I'm a firm believer in that.
[03:46:31.920 --> 03:46:34.920]  I've called in way too much over the past time.
[03:46:34.920 --> 03:46:37.920]  I just wanted to call in and give my two cents.
[03:46:37.920 --> 03:46:39.920]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:46:39.920 --> 03:46:43.920]  But remember, folks, when you speak out, they will come on you.
[03:46:43.920 --> 03:46:45.920]  But there's there's coming.
[03:46:45.920 --> 03:46:49.920]  There's a crescendo coming in this country and the establishment knows it.
[03:46:49.920 --> 03:46:54.920]  And I'm not trying to preach it acquire here, but there will be hopefully.
[03:46:54.920 --> 03:46:58.920]  I mean, I think the future can be bright, but we got to start talking about projects.
[03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:01.920]  We got to start talking about getting everybody back to work.
[03:47:01.920 --> 03:47:07.920]  I read a lot of LaRouche literature, but though I am a Ron Paul, Ram Paul supporter,
[03:47:07.920 --> 03:47:09.920]  I don't care.
[03:47:09.920 --> 03:47:10.920]  I want to win.
[03:47:10.920 --> 03:47:12.920]  I think we all want to win.
[03:47:12.920 --> 03:47:15.920]  I think, you know, yeah, thanks.
[03:47:15.920 --> 03:47:16.920]  Thank you, Chase.
[03:47:16.920 --> 03:47:17.920]  All right.
[03:47:17.920 --> 03:47:18.920]  Let's chase in Texas.
[03:47:18.920 --> 03:47:19.920]  All right.
[03:47:19.920 --> 03:47:22.920]  Now I want to play this video because I don't think we had a chance earlier today.
[03:47:22.920 --> 03:47:27.920]  Now this is a Muslim refugee saying that the main goal is to alarm a size Europeans.
[03:47:27.920 --> 03:47:29.920]  And actually, I don't think it's in English.
[03:47:29.920 --> 03:47:34.920]  So maybe we can just roll the video and I'll just say what the guy is saying for
[03:47:34.920 --> 03:47:36.920]  all all the viewers here.
[03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:37.920]  Okay.
[03:47:37.920 --> 03:47:38.920]  So this is the headline.
[03:47:38.920 --> 03:47:43.920]  Muslim refugee says the main goal is to alarm a size Europeans and kit did a hot topic about
[03:47:43.920 --> 03:47:44.920]  this as well.
[03:47:44.920 --> 03:47:45.920]  And they were talking to a guy.
[03:47:45.920 --> 03:47:46.920]  He was on a train.
[03:47:46.920 --> 03:47:49.920]  He was interviewed by a Arabic television station.
[03:47:49.920 --> 03:47:54.920]  He says my main goal for relieving Syria is to lead people to the except acceptance of
[03:47:54.920 --> 03:47:55.920]  Islam.
[03:47:55.920 --> 03:48:00.920]  And he says the individual says that he is willing to sell his country and even his
[03:48:00.920 --> 03:48:06.920]  own parents in order to reach paradise by converting Europeans to Islam who in turn
[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:11.920]  will then Islam a size others.
[03:48:11.920 --> 03:48:16.920]  And the videos available on info wars.com if you guys want to go and look at it at your
[03:48:16.920 --> 03:48:17.920]  leisure.
[03:48:17.920 --> 03:48:19.920]  So let's go back to our calls now.
[03:48:19.920 --> 03:48:21.920]  Let's see who's been holding the longest.
[03:48:21.920 --> 03:48:23.920]  We have Bill in Wisconsin.
[03:48:23.920 --> 03:48:24.920]  Go ahead, Bill.
[03:48:24.920 --> 03:48:25.920]  Yeah.
[03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:26.920]  Hello, Jarkari.
[03:48:26.920 --> 03:48:27.920]  Hey.
[03:48:27.920 --> 03:48:29.920]  Yeah, I got a question about false flags.
[03:48:29.920 --> 03:48:32.920]  We've had a lot of false flags in the United States.
[03:48:32.920 --> 03:48:36.920]  And many even before 9 11.
[03:48:36.920 --> 03:48:41.920]  And the question I have is why do the American people keep falling for these things over
[03:48:41.920 --> 03:48:43.920]  and over and over again?
[03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:44.920]  Yeah.
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:47.920]  Well, if it's like, let's think of a football game, right?
[03:48:47.920 --> 03:48:52.920]  So if you run a QB sneak up the middle and you score touchdown every time, why won't you
[03:48:52.920 --> 03:48:54.920]  keep running the same thing?
[03:48:54.920 --> 03:48:59.920]  So it's it's this, I guess, conspiracy nature to use that word.
[03:48:59.920 --> 03:49:04.920]  You know, anytime you question official story, just like when we talked about the Daily Beast
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:09.920]  article today, because you point out things like there's a SWAT guy reported in the woods
[03:49:09.920 --> 03:49:10.920]  from a neighboring county.
[03:49:10.920 --> 03:49:14.920]  Al, they said the shooter was running back and forth between the building and his car
[03:49:14.920 --> 03:49:15.920]  and stuff like that.
[03:49:15.920 --> 03:49:19.920]  The simple fact that you point that out, people equate that to saying that you say that nobody
[03:49:19.920 --> 03:49:20.920]  died in Sandy Hook.
[03:49:20.920 --> 03:49:25.920]  And it's that same kind of deal when things are actual false flags, when you talk about
[03:49:25.920 --> 03:49:31.920]  a golf of Tonkin or you talk about the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, 1993, when
[03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:34.920]  they had the guy cook the bomb, they blew up the basement and then they try to blame
[03:49:34.920 --> 03:49:35.920]  it on them.
[03:49:35.920 --> 03:49:39.920]  The only thing that saved his bacon was that he had recordings from the FBI when they said,
[03:49:39.920 --> 03:49:41.920]  yeah, we want you to build us a real bomb.
[03:49:41.920 --> 03:49:42.920]  He said, why do you want us?
[03:49:42.920 --> 03:49:43.920]  Why do you want to build a real bomb?
[03:49:43.920 --> 03:49:44.920]  You want to kill you?
[03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:45.920]  Let us worry about that.
[03:49:45.920 --> 03:49:46.920]  So it's that kind of deal.
[03:49:46.920 --> 03:49:50.920]  And I think it's really the shock and awe that people can't accept that certain individuals,
[03:49:50.920 --> 03:49:54.920]  I don't want to say the government in general, but certain individuals within the government
[03:49:54.920 --> 03:49:57.920]  would be willing to do such a horrendous thing.
[03:49:57.920 --> 03:50:02.920]  Whether you talk about giving black people syphilis and all these other type of horrific
[03:50:02.920 --> 03:50:06.920]  things that have gone on in our country, nobody wants to admit that our own government could
[03:50:06.920 --> 03:50:09.920]  do it because we're supposed to be the light on the hill, right?
[03:50:09.920 --> 03:50:13.920]  We're supposed to have the moral authority so nobody wants to believe that our own government
[03:50:13.920 --> 03:50:16.920]  could be a part of something so heinous.
[03:50:16.920 --> 03:50:18.920]  Thank you so much, Bill in Wisconsin.
[03:50:18.920 --> 03:50:20.920]  I hope I answered your question right there.
[03:50:20.920 --> 03:50:23.920]  I think we have time for maybe one quick call before we go to break.
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:26.920]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Maine.
[03:50:26.920 --> 03:50:28.920]  Go ahead, Rob.
[03:50:28.920 --> 03:50:29.920]  Oh, never mind.
[03:50:29.920 --> 03:50:30.920]  I'm sorry, Rob.
[03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:31.920]  Hold that thought.
[03:50:31.920 --> 03:50:33.920]  I went to you a little bit too late.
[03:50:33.920 --> 03:50:34.920]  We'll come back to you right after this break.
[03:50:34.920 --> 03:50:35.920]  So stay tuned.
[03:50:35.920 --> 03:50:38.920]  This is Jakari Jackson on the Alex Jones show.
[03:50:38.920 --> 03:50:39.920]  Stay tuned.
[03:50:39.920 --> 03:50:42.920]  Info Wars Nightly News coming up tonight, but we're going to go over some more of your
[03:50:42.920 --> 03:50:46.920]  calls and tell you about the great specials available at infowarshop.com.
[03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:59.920]  Stay tuned.
[03:50:59.920 --> 03:51:04.920]  My name is Don Whisken and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was
[03:51:04.920 --> 03:51:07.920]  told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:07.920 --> 03:51:09.920]  What did I do?
[03:51:09.920 --> 03:51:15.920]  I created Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart
[03:51:15.920 --> 03:51:17.920]  and gave me back my life.
[03:51:17.920 --> 03:51:24.920]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you so you don't have to suffer
[03:51:24.920 --> 03:51:26.920]  the same thing I did.
[03:51:26.920 --> 03:51:31.920]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:31.920 --> 03:51:35.920]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:35.920 --> 03:51:47.920]  To get your Extendivite call 1-877-928-8822 that's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:47.920 --> 03:51:58.920]  Extendivite is only $69.95 for a two month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:51:58.920 --> 03:52:03.920]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you on our side day in and day out,
[03:52:03.920 --> 03:52:07.920]  exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalist and we're starting to see
[03:52:07.920 --> 03:52:09.920]  big effects.
[03:52:09.920 --> 03:52:11.920]  And the word is getting out.
[03:52:11.920 --> 03:52:16.920]  The globalist want to make us dependent and as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[03:52:16.920 --> 03:52:22.920]  Ammunition, food and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War.
[03:52:22.920 --> 03:52:25.920]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[03:52:25.920 --> 03:52:29.920]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[03:52:29.920 --> 03:52:35.920]  This in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalist or government.
[03:52:35.920 --> 03:52:42.920]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old fashioned way with pure free market free will capitalism.

[03:54:28.920 --> 03:54:30.920]  So, hey man, I want you guys to come to my neighborhood.
[03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:34.920]  You know, we love to go all over the country, all over the world, but those things do cost money.
[03:54:34.920 --> 03:54:41.920]  If you want us to airdrop Joe Biggs into your neighborhood with a flaming guitar of awesomeness, go ahead and get your subscription to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:54:41.920 --> 03:54:47.920]  Now we got cut off by the break, us talking to Rob in Maine. So go ahead, Rob, and finish your part.
[03:54:47.920 --> 03:54:54.920]  Oh, thanks, Jakari. I've been doing this for 13 years, doing my own public access show, trying to wake people up.
[03:54:54.920 --> 03:54:59.920]  So I know the level of cognitive dissonance that it's going on out there.
[03:54:59.920 --> 03:55:06.920]  So I have a big, important question. I was trying to get through to Alex because I'm really curious.
[03:55:06.920 --> 03:55:12.920]  I saw Joe Rogan completely discredit Chemtrailing a couple of years ago on his television show.
[03:55:12.920 --> 03:55:21.920]  Now, I'm sure others have seen it, but when I saw that, I completely convinced he's a traitor.
[03:55:21.920 --> 03:55:26.920]  I just felt like he was a traitor, a sellout. He completely discredited it.
[03:55:26.920 --> 03:55:34.920]  So if you guys could get to that or address that, why Joe Rogan did that, said that?
[03:55:34.920 --> 03:55:39.920]  Alright, thank you so much, Rob in Maine. I've heard of that episode of Joe Rogan.
[03:55:39.920 --> 03:55:45.920]  I've never actually seen it. I know he and Alex are friends, so I guess that'd be a better question for him to address.
[03:55:45.920 --> 03:55:48.920]  Now, as far as Chemtrails, not everything is a Chemtrail.
[03:55:48.920 --> 03:55:56.920]  I'm sure you know that, Rob, but you know, even I've made mistakes in the past looking at, like, force-fighting planes, dropping their ordinance.
[03:55:56.920 --> 03:55:58.920]  And I mistakenly said those things were Chemtrails.
[03:55:58.920 --> 03:56:05.920]  Not everything is a Chemtrail, but we have seen reports, like, what in the world are they saying, or what in the world are they spraying,
[03:56:05.920 --> 03:56:10.920]  where they talk about how things like aluminum have increased dramatically since they started spraying, whatever it is.
[03:56:10.920 --> 03:56:16.920]  Whether you want to call them Chemtrails, persistent contrails, persistent aerosol trails, whatever the proper term may be,
[03:56:16.920 --> 03:56:20.920]  there has been a change since they've been doing this for the past several years.
[03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:25.920]  Thank you for calling. Let's go ahead and talk to Dean in Utah. Go ahead, Dean.
[03:56:25.920 --> 03:56:30.920]  Hey, Jackari, it's Dean in Utah. First time caller, longtime listener.
[03:56:30.920 --> 03:56:40.920]  I just wanted to say, you know, Trump has got this whole thing so upset.
[03:56:40.920 --> 03:56:43.920]  It's driving the elite crazy. I know it is.
[03:56:43.920 --> 03:56:49.920]  And Jeff made that statement that you guys pointed out that he will never be president.
[03:56:49.920 --> 03:56:58.920]  And I was just wondering, do you know if they've got the popular vote, can they really do that to him? Can they knock him off?
[03:56:58.920 --> 03:57:04.920]  Well, we've seen them, like, refusing things to, you know, Ron Paul a couple of elections ago.
[03:57:04.920 --> 03:57:08.920]  As far as the delegate process, I guess that'd be a better question for Richard Reeves.
[03:57:08.920 --> 03:57:12.920]  He's our reporter out there on the scenes. He's going to all the campaign trails.
[03:57:12.920 --> 03:57:17.920]  So maybe the next time he gets in or we Skype with him, he can answer that a little better than I can. Thank you.
[03:57:17.920 --> 03:57:24.920]  We'll move on to the next caller for a second time. Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Michigan. Go ahead, Alex.
[03:57:24.920 --> 03:57:27.920]  Hey, what's going on, Jakart? Hey, how are you doing?
[03:57:27.920 --> 03:57:33.920]  Good. I just want to say you guys are doing a really good job. You and Leigh Ann doing a really good job.
[03:57:33.920 --> 03:57:34.920]  Oh, thank you.
[03:57:34.920 --> 03:57:46.920]  Yeah. I was going to talk about ISIS in Michigan, maybe. I don't mean to be like Islamophobic or whatever, but I hear like we have like the biggest Muslim population or whatever.
[03:57:46.920 --> 03:57:47.920]  Anything about that?
[03:57:47.920 --> 03:57:51.920]  Oh, I don't know about what the population is, but you can tell me more.
[03:57:51.920 --> 03:57:55.920]  We're coming to the end, so make your point very quickly.
[03:57:55.920 --> 03:58:06.920]  Just great job with all the products. The iodine, x2 is excellent. I'm going to try the coffee to the immune coffee with the mushrooms.
[03:58:06.920 --> 03:58:07.920]  I hear that's really good.
[03:58:07.920 --> 03:58:12.920]  All right. Thank you so much. Brian in California, you have 20 seconds. Go ahead.
[03:58:12.920 --> 03:58:19.920]  Yeah, finally waking up and looking up this morning and seeing the persistent chemtrails in the air.
[03:58:19.920 --> 03:58:30.920]  I was wondering, let's say they're harmless right now, but what's to stop them from doing what they did in Goldfinger when they had Operation Grand Slam?
[03:58:30.920 --> 03:58:36.920]  All right. Well, thank you so much, Brian. I'm sorry. We are completely out of time. Call in tomorrow and I'll let you make your point.
[03:58:36.920 --> 03:58:42.920]  More news tonight. InfoWars Nightly News, 7 p.m. Central.
