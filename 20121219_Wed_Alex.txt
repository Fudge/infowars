[00:40.920 --> 00:53.160]  completely and totally worried in a giant way that the federal government was
[00:53.160 --> 01:02.880]  going to move under globalist control to restrict the Second Amendment and to
[01:02.880 --> 01:06.960]  basically instead of just trying to eat around the edges go for it all right now
[01:06.960 --> 01:12.840]  there are repeals in hundreds of newspapers police chiefs company heads
[01:12.840 --> 01:17.040]  members of Congress saying get rid of the Second Amendment outright they're
[01:17.040 --> 01:19.800]  not arguing that the Second Amendment didn't mean you could own guns like they
[01:19.800 --> 01:26.280]  used to do they're now saying let's just take the guns up at info wars calm
[01:26.280 --> 01:32.240]  right now we have this article even without Congress Obama could act to
[01:32.240 --> 01:36.000]  restrict guns and no it's not the countless articles we've written the
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.680]  last four or five days since Friday's tragic events at Sandy Hook or the video
[01:40.680 --> 01:46.520]  I put out called the fixes in they are coming for our guns no that is a Reuters
[01:46.520 --> 01:54.640]  headline a Reuters headline I'm gonna say that again a Reuters headline that's
[01:54.640 --> 02:00.120]  what Bloomberg meant last Saturday when he said use executive power to take the
[02:00.120 --> 02:09.160]  guns this is Reuters ladies and gentlemen so now is the time for everyone
[02:09.160 --> 02:14.000]  to understand just how much trouble we're in before I get to all this news and
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.760]  I will be calm the Second Amendment's worth it I will break down the facts and
[02:18.760 --> 02:24.000]  give you a battlefield report on what's about to happen and we've got Larry Pratt
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.920]  who was on yesterday he went on Pierce Morgan it was unbelievable on the
[02:27.920 --> 02:32.480]  dwindling faltering state-run media of CNN he's gonna be popping in at the
[02:32.480 --> 02:37.880]  bottom of the hour to talk about the incredible lies of Pierce Morgan and
[02:37.880 --> 02:41.000]  Pierce Morgan was calling him a liar we're gonna go over the statistics of
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.320]  the doubling of violent crime conservatively in the 15 years since
[02:45.320 --> 02:52.240]  England totally banned guns in the hands of citizens and we're gonna go over the
[02:52.240 --> 02:58.560]  FBI's own real crime statistics versus the hoax that you're seeing and the
[02:58.560 --> 03:03.320]  hoax that the media the controlled corporate media is putting out but I
[03:03.320 --> 03:07.840]  want to say this again they said before the election quietly that we're gonna
[03:07.840 --> 03:11.680]  use executive orders to get the guns Obama signed more executive orders and
[03:11.680 --> 03:15.920]  all presidents before him the first executive orders were how much money
[03:15.920 --> 03:20.640]  Congress allotted to Martha Washington on the plate she was gonna buy she could
[03:20.640 --> 03:25.880]  put on state dinners at the president's residence at that time in New York the
[03:25.880 --> 03:33.840]  president executes the laws now the president on war on taxes on cyber
[03:33.840 --> 03:39.480]  orders on power plants on everything is just signing orders in fact I meant to
[03:39.480 --> 03:44.240]  print this before well you guys type in ATF takes public comment on shotgun ban
[03:44.240 --> 03:49.160]  because a bunch of newspapers will come up but there's the actual ATF filing
[03:49.160 --> 03:56.160]  last year late 2011 about 13 months ago where they just so we're just gonna ban
[03:56.160 --> 03:59.280]  most shotguns and then there was the Congress said no if there has to be a
[03:59.280 --> 04:03.200]  law so they backed off but that's the issue is that this is what they're
[04:03.200 --> 04:07.280]  moving towards a no-gun list where they just put you on an executive list as
[04:07.280 --> 04:11.520]  Rahm Emanuel called for there it is ATF to accept public comment prior to
[04:11.520 --> 04:15.960]  outline shotguns folks people are saying hey this will cause a civil war we've
[04:15.960 --> 04:19.520]  got articles where Mike Adams talked to a bunch of FBI and police he knows they're
[04:19.520 --> 04:23.640]  like well that'll cause a civil war they won't do it guys that's the plan okay
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.760]  and they're going to initiate it even if they think it's unpopular and will fail
[04:28.760 --> 04:32.800]  because they want to label gun owners as terrorists you've already seen that
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.520]  starting saying we're the Klan we're terrorists kill us arrest us kill the
[04:37.520 --> 04:43.080]  NRA heads that's all in the news this is a plan to start a revolution in this
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.080]  country we're really the counter-revolutionaries of the globalist but
[04:46.080 --> 04:50.480]  they're going to be coming after us and this is hard core information I'll

[08:32.720 --> 08:40.720]  every form of tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson live from Austin
[08:40.720 --> 08:49.800]  Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen I told you
[08:49.800 --> 08:54.040]  that the globalists were getting ready to implode this country I told you that
[08:54.040 --> 08:58.080]  they would blame preppers and patriots for mass shootings and attacks I told
[08:58.080 --> 09:03.400]  you they would use executive orders and executive power to restrict the second
[09:03.400 --> 09:07.840]  amendment our so-called president Barry Cetero is speaking with Biden right now
[09:07.840 --> 09:12.160]  going we need to be able to know if somebody's got a criminal record we need
[09:12.160 --> 09:15.640]  to have a background check he was just saying that before we went live here
[09:15.640 --> 09:19.800]  we're about to go to the feed when they do a total background check this guy had
[09:19.800 --> 09:24.880]  been refused not three not four but five times this guy was under psychiatric
[09:24.880 --> 09:29.840]  care undoubtedly on psychotropic but they are trying to keep that sealed this
[09:29.840 --> 09:34.680]  is incredible ladies and gentlemen they're creating a mass hoax and now
[09:34.680 --> 09:39.680]  Reuters is reporting what Bloomberg called for even without Congress Obama
[09:39.680 --> 09:46.040]  could act to restrict guns and they go on to announce that's what's set to
[09:46.040 --> 09:50.560]  happen I talked to a high-level congressional source on Monday who was
[09:50.560 --> 09:54.520]  going to get back with me and then it just got lost in the fog of war I need
[09:54.520 --> 10:00.120]  to call back and talk to that Congress person I'll just leave it at that who
[10:00.120 --> 10:06.400]  said the word is that they are going to use executive power to go after the
[10:06.400 --> 10:11.880]  guns and that's why I told you that three weeks ago in the cover story in the
[10:11.880 --> 10:15.800]  magazine we already knew that that's what Larry Pratt said yesterday he's
[10:15.800 --> 10:19.440]  joining us again today to respond to the president also appears Morgan trying to
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.320]  demonize him last night on the dwindling CNN but he's got Biden with him and he
[10:25.320 --> 10:28.880]  says hey you got a right to have arms but we got a right to take military style
[10:28.880 --> 10:32.800]  guns that's what he he's answering questions right now let's go to this
[10:32.800 --> 10:40.280]  disgusting press conference here it is somebody like me and what I said was
[10:40.280 --> 10:46.360]  that the ultimate package would involve a balance of spending cuts and tax
[10:46.360 --> 10:52.320]  increases that's exactly what I've put forward okay what I've said is that so
[10:52.320 --> 10:55.920]  again he came out and talked about mass shootings and said we need to restrict
[10:55.920 --> 10:59.400]  the Second Amendment you know that you have a right basically to turn your
[10:59.400 --> 11:04.920]  guns in and that everybody agrees you don't need these military style weapons
[11:04.920 --> 11:09.800]  which is all semi-autos most guns and again guys we print me that ATF report
[11:09.800 --> 11:14.520]  I want to show that to folks where they say oh we're gonna make a rule and ban
[11:14.520 --> 11:20.880]  60 plus percent of all shotguns oh we're gonna make a rule and any shotgun that
[11:20.880 --> 11:27.640]  semi-auto or a shotgun that could take a clip in the bottom not not by
[11:27.640 --> 11:35.400]  manufacture but a shotgun that could take a clip by the gun being changed
[11:35.400 --> 11:42.920]  converted you're gonna have to turn that in not just that you can't buy them
[11:42.920 --> 11:47.680]  anymore or manufacture them or import them they're going to just take them and
[11:47.680 --> 11:52.240]  and here is Reuters and you guys monitor it when he goes to gun questions tell me
[11:52.240 --> 11:56.560]  and we'll go back to him even without Congress Obama could act to restrict
[11:56.560 --> 12:04.400]  guns Reuters unburdened by reelection worries and empowered by law and that's
[12:04.400 --> 12:08.680]  a lie see they're trying to give him the cover to act without Congress did you
[12:08.680 --> 12:12.880]  hear that why even have a Congress see they're now saying oh we don't need
[12:12.880 --> 12:15.880]  Congress to launch wars we don't need Congress for cybersecurity acts take
[12:15.880 --> 12:19.080]  over the web we don't need Congress to shut down power plants we don't need
[12:19.080 --> 12:22.520]  Congress for carbon taxes see how more and more is just act
[12:22.520 --> 12:28.360]  executively this is how dictatorship works by increment and and we've gone
[12:28.360 --> 12:32.680]  from the first executive orders look them up Martha Washington asking Congress
[12:32.680 --> 12:38.160]  for money to buy a bunch of state China plates and cutlery to be able to have
[12:38.160 --> 12:41.840]  the French ambassador there that's one of the first executive orders we've done
[12:41.840 --> 12:45.960]  a report on it go look them up they're on the Library of Congress the first
[12:45.960 --> 12:51.080]  executive orders were George Washington asking for the White House to be
[12:51.080 --> 12:56.680]  repainted to now hey Congress I'll go to war if I feel like it under NATO
[12:56.680 --> 13:00.840]  authority be bad enough he said under presidential authority that's dictator
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.160]  this is dictator puppet viceroy behavior and now on every front we keep
[13:05.160 --> 13:12.320]  explaining and now there's all these voices from Michael Moore to former
[13:12.320 --> 13:17.600]  police chiefs current police chiefs the mayor of New York Reuters listen to this
[13:17.600 --> 13:23.240]  unburdened by reelection worries and empowered by law to act without Congress
[13:23.240 --> 13:28.680]  US president Barack Obama could take action to improve background checks now
[13:28.680 --> 13:33.400]  no again with what they proposed under Rahm Emanuel is that that is they just
[13:33.400 --> 13:36.800]  put you on a list that you can't own guns even if you haven't been adjudicated
[13:36.800 --> 13:40.680]  mentally ill he just said if we don't like you we think you're bad we just put
[13:40.680 --> 13:44.680]  you on that list and no guns for you they've played that clip at nauseam but
[13:44.680 --> 13:49.480]  I'm gonna dig it back up and play it today later in the hour so see it's all
[13:49.480 --> 13:54.040]  that's reasonable background checks oh it's reasonable let's have some TSA now
[13:54.040 --> 13:57.040]  they stick their hands down your pants by the way I've got some bad news it's

[17:12.040 --> 17:19.840]  doing everything they folks let me get back to this okay even without
[17:19.840 --> 17:24.240]  Congress Obama could act to restrict guns and the way they're gonna do it is
[17:24.240 --> 17:28.080]  hey it's reasonable we're just gonna take all your semi-autos and hey we're
[17:28.080 --> 17:31.440]  just gonna put you on a no-gun bottle list and make it turn them in if we say
[17:31.440 --> 17:37.120]  so with all this data mining prospects for gun control victim disarmament
[17:37.120 --> 17:40.120]  legislation intensified in the wake of the school massacre in Newtown
[17:40.120 --> 17:45.200]  Connecticut has more pro-gun rights lawmakers said on Monday they were open
[17:45.200 --> 17:48.920]  to the possibility while Obama shed three cabinet members met with the
[17:48.920 --> 17:53.080]  White House to discuss the subject ladies and gentlemen the Republicans are
[17:53.080 --> 17:58.880]  gonna go along with all the tax increases total taxes on your 75% on on

[18:11.280 --> 18:14.920]  been given the war they pulled three shows off discovery alone that are top
[18:14.920 --> 18:19.360]  rated gun shows they're canceling shows everywhere else they are pulling guns
[18:19.360 --> 18:23.520]  out of Walmart dick sporting goods and most the other places we called and
[18:23.520 --> 18:28.200]  again they've been given the corporate jurisdiction word at the CFR real
[18:28.200 --> 18:31.800]  government councils these corporate councils this is the time to make their
[18:31.800 --> 18:36.480]  full move and go you're a Nazi you're a demon you know the NRA needs to die
[18:36.480 --> 18:39.760]  we're seeing this mainstream news and no one's getting arrested they're calling
[18:39.760 --> 18:43.920]  for the murder of Wayne LaPierre they're calling for the murder of the NRA board
[18:43.920 --> 18:48.600]  got an array board member coming on tomorrow they are just wholesale this
[18:48.600 --> 18:52.680]  is their revolution against America and by the way Rob do did a report last night
[18:52.680 --> 18:58.440]  with news clips with eyewitnesses that these aren't rumors saying oh I saw the
[18:58.440 --> 19:02.440]  guy in the camo and the bag and you know he said I'm not the one and the
[19:02.440 --> 19:05.520]  cops took him away and they won't say who he is and yeah it looks like the guy
[19:05.520 --> 19:09.680]  that was in the school with the other person folks they did this what you do
[19:09.680 --> 19:16.440]  and and remember all the all the over a hundred FBI deals even mainstream media
[19:16.440 --> 19:18.920]  admitted where they would go find mentally ill people and give them a bomb
[19:18.920 --> 19:22.080]  train them take them to bomb the Christmas tree and Portland or whatever
[19:22.080 --> 19:25.480]  and then it came out they were setting up mentally ill people and this guy was
[19:25.480 --> 19:29.160]  now under psychiatric daily visits he was about to be committed he's going
[19:29.160 --> 19:33.320]  he's on these drugs undoubtedly he's a wind-up toy they bring him in they kill
[19:33.320 --> 19:38.120]  him he's wearing a mask the real shooters kill exfiltrate out I mean
[19:38.120 --> 19:41.160]  they've done it before they did fast and furious to blame the Second Amendment
[19:41.160 --> 19:46.320]  and this goes on to say the ATF can just ban guns with rules under law it's not
[19:46.320 --> 19:49.720]  true they just say it they're hoaxing dumb people and that Obama could sign
[19:49.720 --> 19:53.840]  executive orders and that the word is he is okay and we'll give you more on what
[19:53.840 --> 19:57.000]  he's been talking about this press conference coming back Larry Pratt is

[24:15.760 --> 24:21.840]  okay a transcript of Obama's statements is not out yet but my team wrote
[24:21.840 --> 24:27.680]  notes on what he said and we do have a USA Today report that has some of the
[24:27.680 --> 24:32.240]  quotes and Obama has done what we knew he would do he is enlisting all
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.880]  Americans to join him in a crusade against quote military-style weapons
[24:36.880 --> 24:42.680]  that's almost all handguns and rifles they're saying only hunting stuff
[24:42.680 --> 24:46.680]  basically which is not what the Second Amendment is about okay so they're going
[24:46.680 --> 24:49.960]  with that like hey you got a right to have guns you can have that single shot
[24:49.960 --> 24:55.840]  shotgun or rifle we're taking everything else so we have this information he
[24:55.840 --> 25:01.160]  lists all the massacres with pleasure and he's willing to bet that's a quote
[25:01.160 --> 25:06.080]  that responsible gun owners don't want criminals to have weapons of war and
[25:06.080 --> 25:09.120]  then he went on to say there's no background check and we need a
[25:09.120 --> 25:14.360]  background check I mean well really playing on the dumb public but they
[25:14.360 --> 25:17.600]  keep saying everybody's got machine guns nobody's got machine guns and machine
[25:17.600 --> 25:20.520]  guns hardly ever get used in crimes you got to jump there 100 hoops to get one
[25:20.520 --> 25:26.480]  and they give you a news flash they're not very good for killing people so the
[25:26.480 --> 25:30.480]  military goes to single and three burst but again these these anti-gunners they
[25:30.480 --> 25:34.800]  know that the general public that isn't into guns they count on them being
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.960]  ignorant and the gun culture was the top-rated shows everywhere A&E
[25:39.960 --> 25:44.640]  discovery history just I never even watched television I turned it on and
[25:44.640 --> 25:48.280]  every show was people you know shooting guns and women getting into guns and
[25:48.280 --> 25:52.440]  every women's magazine I saw I mean even the local Chronicle you see so they're
[25:52.440 --> 25:56.560]  panicking and they're pushing everything they've got and Aaron ran up to me and
[25:56.560 --> 26:01.120]  reminded me the 68 gun control act was pushed on the back of JFK being killed
[26:01.120 --> 26:05.920]  because why they could just buy a gun through the mail and of course Lee Harvey
[26:05.920 --> 26:09.360]  Oswald could have walked into any shop without his name and just bought that
[26:09.360 --> 26:14.400]  rifle but no it had to be my mail so they could shut that down and then they
[26:14.400 --> 26:19.280]  couldn't pass it and so RFK got killed and it's now come out sir hand sir hand
[26:19.280 --> 26:23.320]  and mainstream news didn't shoot Kennedy and the CIA was there and we know the
[26:23.320 --> 26:29.400]  name of the CIA agent asset that did it so the government did JFK and RFK and
[26:29.400 --> 26:35.400]  used it to pass the 68 gun control act and then crime rates exploded because
[26:35.400 --> 26:38.640]  citizens couldn't get guns then people started going through the hoops to get
[26:38.640 --> 26:43.920]  the concealed carry all the rest of it and crime rates have dropped and I'm
[26:43.920 --> 26:48.560]  gonna go over that after Larry Pratt leaves us today I'm gonna play the
[26:48.560 --> 26:53.480]  video and audio of him being attacked on Pierce Morgan while I show viewers the
[26:53.480 --> 26:57.760]  FBI's own statistics and then show you Europe statistics and England statistics
[26:57.760 --> 27:04.800]  and Mexico statistics showing that as more as we got more guns crime went down
[27:04.800 --> 27:10.720]  not what Pierce Morgan is saying again it's all about perception just like for
[27:10.720 --> 27:14.320]  two years most people wouldn't go in the water because of jaws that came out in
[27:14.320 --> 27:17.440]  the early 70s and we have the newspaper articles I'm gonna do another
[27:17.440 --> 27:21.760]  report on it showing where people would panic and not go in the water in beaches
[27:21.760 --> 27:25.960]  lost more than half their customers for at least two years they had to do PSA
[27:25.960 --> 27:29.680]  saying there's not great white sharks here you know they kill a few people a
[27:29.680 --> 27:36.000]  year worldwide it's not a problem and it's the same mass hoax ladies and
[27:36.000 --> 27:42.640]  gentlemen 88 mass shoot people died this year in mass shootings 88 88 most of
[27:42.640 --> 27:47.560]  those were gang related but Obama doesn't care you would think the end of
[27:47.560 --> 27:51.920]  the world happened because they show you the kids they use them they dangle them
[27:51.920 --> 27:56.400]  in front of you using their deaths to disarm this country and bring us all
[27:56.400 --> 27:59.560]  into the darkness of the mega cities where they've taken the citizens guns
[27:59.560 --> 28:03.040]  that have such high crime rates where the people are fed on they're gonna lead
[28:03.040 --> 28:09.640]  and anti-gunner Biden has been tapped to lead it we have a deep obligation all
[28:09.640 --> 28:13.680]  of us to try and end gun violence yeah they say never to get there be any guns
[28:13.680 --> 28:20.160]  period in a shooting Obama said at the White House this time the words need to
[28:20.160 --> 28:25.520]  lead to action and as Reuters reported a bunch of Republicans have lined up and
[28:25.520 --> 28:32.840]  said yep we're gonna not just put people on a no-gun buy list for no reason we
[28:32.840 --> 28:37.040]  need to shut down all sale of semi-autos and we need to turn them in
[28:37.040 --> 28:41.280]  that's reasonable you don't want to kill the kids do you time to turn your guns
[28:41.280 --> 28:45.800]  in you you have a right to a second amendment a right to turn them in it's
[28:45.800 --> 28:49.560]  here because folks they've already got it all your pension funds they're already
[28:49.560 --> 28:53.040]  all gone they're already gone just like Europe they're gonna implode this place
[28:53.040 --> 28:56.800]  totally and they want to be able to come around just pick you up and take you to
[28:56.800 --> 29:00.800]  jail do whatever they want with you the police have been trained and hired to do
[29:00.800 --> 29:04.760]  body cavity searches of women you name it on the side of the road children old
[29:04.760 --> 29:09.280]  people they're setting up checkpoints everywhere the feds are run by foreign
[29:09.280 --> 29:13.440]  banks we're going under full occupation now Obama put an internet kill switch
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.600]  in Congress wouldn't pass it mainstream news even said it was the end of
[29:17.600 --> 29:21.640]  internet freedom he said I've signed an order but it's secret Congress can't see
[29:21.640 --> 29:26.720]  it we Congress makes the laws but the UN bragged hey it gives us control of the
[29:26.720 --> 29:32.880]  web we can censor see it's on it's on see all you fools that don't want guns
[29:32.880 --> 29:35.920]  you understand they're gonna take everything else the entire bill of
[29:35.920 --> 29:39.800]  rights you think stuff's bad now they're coming with the fairness doctrine to
[29:39.800 --> 29:44.040]  shut down talk radio we'd all better stand up against this hoax now or they're

[33:46.000 --> 33:50.680]  own financial publications like the Financial Times of London Bloomberg you
[33:50.680 --> 33:55.800]  name it that don't worry we've signed America and Europe on to our 1.5
[33:55.800 --> 34:01.160]  quadrillion derivatives and there's no way their governments are getting out of
[34:01.160 --> 34:10.160]  this they say they have signed on we are taking over these countries period and
[34:10.160 --> 34:13.560]  we are bringing them down and we're going to get rid of their standard of
[34:13.560 --> 34:16.800]  living and we're going to sign their kids on to all of our debt and they've
[34:16.800 --> 34:22.400]  announced themselves world rulers we have an article titled bankers declare
[34:22.400 --> 34:25.640]  they've captured and conquered the United States and Europe and it has
[34:25.640 --> 34:36.440]  dozens of links and video clips to them openly bragging in everyone's face that
[34:36.440 --> 34:41.320]  they have been able to do this now it's very simple the last thing they've got
[34:41.320 --> 34:44.480]  to get is our guns they're already announcing they'll take your property
[34:44.480 --> 34:48.520]  without due process they're already announcing the IRS won't let you leave
[34:48.520 --> 34:54.160]  the country if they feel like it no judge no jury you just can't leave no
[34:54.160 --> 34:57.600]  judge no jury they just take your back account they're going down a list of
[34:57.600 --> 35:01.480]  every basic liberty and getting rid of it they're going down a list of every
[35:01.480 --> 35:09.360]  tyranny and they're putting it in its place we historically know what this
[35:09.360 --> 35:19.600]  means we historically understand how tyrannies take over time and time and
[35:19.600 --> 35:31.960]  time again and we are now going into this system full bore and it is so
[35:31.960 --> 35:38.960]  painful to see the fact that our country has gotten to this point and is in the
[35:38.960 --> 35:44.360]  grip of hardcore mafia that is dangling 20 dead sad little children and their
[35:44.360 --> 35:48.480]  families and the sadness they're going through in our face to terrorize us and
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.560]  say you're not a good person if you don't turn your guns in you're not a good
[35:52.560 --> 35:59.000]  person if you don't go along with all of this you are a bad person if you don't
[35:59.000 --> 36:10.040]  submit to all of this tyranny I mean it is clear total in our face psychological
[36:10.040 --> 36:20.440]  warfare and it is being announced all over the news that they are going to
[36:20.440 --> 36:30.080]  come after our guns period this is the setup and they're not going to stop okay
[36:30.080 --> 36:34.440]  they've already gone for broke these are criminals and they're engaged in
[36:34.440 --> 36:38.160]  psych warfare and any of these businesses that say they're not gonna sell
[36:38.160 --> 36:42.200]  guns well look it's Walmart it's Dix it's these big globalist multinationals
[36:42.200 --> 36:45.240]  they're controlled by the mega corporations they're controlled by the
[36:45.240 --> 36:54.000]  megabanks they know what they're doing they know what their agenda is and again
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.800]  they have to kill the gun culture now because out of the gun culture the rest
[36:59.800 --> 37:09.760]  of the Liberty culture is growing now on the Larry Pratt issue guys I know he's
[37:09.760 --> 37:14.920]  trying to get through right now we'll go with phone anything we've got okay
[37:15.640 --> 37:22.720]  okay all right anyways he's not gonna be able to be on soon as the issue because
[37:22.720 --> 37:29.480]  he's going to 10 minute window I know that's because you know that's because
[37:29.480 --> 37:32.840]  we didn't tell him when we say we need to talk to Larry Pratt we have to tell
[37:32.840 --> 37:43.160]  them it's for the radio all right ladies and gentlemen again this is a very
[37:43.160 --> 37:47.520]  desperate time for our Republic the most desperate it's ever been since our
[37:47.520 --> 37:53.400]  founding Larry Pratt joins us he was viciously attacked and called all sorts
[37:53.400 --> 38:00.560]  of names last night in absolute demonization by a foreigner whose
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.960]  ancestors undoubtedly fought against this country trying to take our guns in
[38:03.960 --> 38:08.920]  1776 and told he was all manner of bad things and then Pierce Morgan put out a
[38:08.920 --> 38:13.160]  bunch of propaganda saying that you know crime rates went down when they took
[38:13.160 --> 38:16.680]  guns in England I have the statistics here while Larry Pratt talks I'm gonna
[38:16.680 --> 38:20.360]  be showing you some of these headlines but Larry thank you on short notice for
[38:20.360 --> 38:23.520]  coming on again today I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to what
[38:23.520 --> 38:29.160]  Pierce Morgan said uninterrupted here on air for a few minutes because he was
[38:29.160 --> 38:34.440]  talking over you the entire time Alex it was it was an extraordinary experience
[38:34.440 --> 38:39.720]  and here silly me I thought that the Brits were such a state the group of
[38:39.720 --> 38:48.080]  people but you saw it I guess the guy melted down he absolutely couldn't get
[38:48.080 --> 38:52.520]  his head around the fact that people should be able to defend themselves and
[38:52.520 --> 38:57.440]  not wait for 20 minutes after they've been murdered for the police to arrive
[38:57.440 --> 39:03.800]  at that was just not something that fit inside his head and so he resorted to
[39:03.800 --> 39:09.720]  ad hominem and I thought at the time this is great this guy is exposing
[39:09.720 --> 39:14.160]  himself to the world that he's a loser that that's the best he can do that
[39:14.160 --> 39:19.520]  that's his idea of an argument he's lost all of the rational discussion can't
[39:19.520 --> 39:25.440]  compete in that arena so he resorts to name-calling and I thought this is
[39:25.440 --> 39:32.720]  wonderful this is what I would it doesn't get any better than this man you
[39:32.720 --> 39:38.240]  are right and and again I've never seen such demonization of gun owners like he
[39:38.240 --> 39:43.560]  was doing to you it's just amazing what do you make of Obama's
[39:43.560 --> 39:47.800]  announcement and Reuters saying that he's gonna use executive orders and ATF
[39:47.800 --> 39:53.000]  rules that's what you said yesterday was the route you thought they'd take it is
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.280]  the pattern that the president has shown that's the way he is conducting
[39:58.280 --> 40:04.320]  himself in his view evidently the fact that he barely got 50 plus percent of
[40:04.320 --> 40:09.120]  the vote means he can do anything he wants that he's not the president in a
[40:09.120 --> 40:13.800]  constitutional republic where the president can do certain things and
[40:13.800 --> 40:20.040]  most things the president cannot do according to the president's view now
[40:20.040 --> 40:24.720]  Barack Obama thinks he can do just about any bloody thing he can get away
[40:24.720 --> 40:31.560]  with and that's a gross misunderstanding of the office of president but it's
[40:31.560 --> 40:36.880]  apparently not the misunderstanding that a communist has and that's really the
[40:36.880 --> 40:43.200]  way the president thinks he was educated that way he is a full or Marxist
[40:43.200 --> 40:50.360]  and this guy is after in grabbing a hold of every bit of power and centralizing
[40:50.360 --> 40:55.360]  it in his hands and as he said even before the election we should have been
[40:55.360 --> 41:00.280]  listening if the Congress won't go along with me then I'm just gonna have to take
[41:00.280 --> 41:10.120]  action myself well hello mr. dictator I guess you will what about the point that
[41:10.120 --> 41:14.240]  Mexico has a total gun ban for citizens and has had 50,000 plus dead the last
[41:14.240 --> 41:18.160]  few years what about the fact that I mean England's crime rate doubled after
[41:18.160 --> 41:22.000]  they took guns I just showed their own numbers they're the most dangerous
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.400]  country in Europe who's the safest Switzerland with more guns per capita
[41:25.400 --> 41:33.320]  than we've got does not compute that that just doesn't fit inside the cranium of
[41:33.320 --> 41:39.720]  the normal liberal thinker I was just being interviewed as you called in by
[41:39.720 --> 41:49.040]  PBS and it just it does not fit they cannot accept the idea that when you
[41:49.040 --> 41:56.880]  take guns away from decent people from the average citizen that things are they
[41:56.880 --> 42:01.880]  can't buy into the idea that things will get worse because their assumption is
[42:01.880 --> 42:06.560]  that you and I can't be trusted you and I are too juvenile you and I are too
[42:06.560 --> 42:12.120]  impetuous well perhaps what they're doing is projecting from themselves on to
[42:12.120 --> 42:19.000]  us and I think a lot of the debate is to to point out to them hey guys we
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.240]  ain't like you but we we really are different we can control ourselves we
[42:24.240 --> 42:27.960]  can control our tempers we can walk around with guns and we never shoot
[42:27.960 --> 42:32.880]  anybody our guns are safer than Ted Kennedy's car our guns kill fewer people
[42:32.880 --> 42:37.440]  than Ted Kennedy's car and they don't like to hear that of course very proud I
[42:37.440 --> 42:40.200]  know you've got to go and I appreciate the short notice I know you're working
[42:40.200 --> 42:44.080]  18 hours a day right now to defend the Republic gun owners org everybody should
[42:44.080 --> 42:48.360]  go immediately join at least sign up for the free email alerts and get active I
[42:48.360 --> 42:53.560]  want to though give you a chance to respond back here to Pierce Morgan
[42:53.560 --> 42:56.880]  anything you'd like to say to him because as you've been talking I've showed
[42:56.880 --> 43:01.840]  England's crime rate highest in Europe 15 years after they banned guns from one
[43:01.840 --> 43:05.760]  of the safest countries in Europe I've shown Mexico after the gun ban most
[43:05.760 --> 43:11.480]  dangerous country in this hemisphere and I'm showing FBI.gov statistics as gun
[43:11.480 --> 43:16.600]  ownership goes up the last 20 years but especially the last five crime rates
[43:16.600 --> 43:22.000]  plunging more than 20% just the last four or five years so here's the facts for
[43:22.000 --> 43:28.640]  Pierce Morgan on screen for people so what can we do rallying right now sir
[43:28.640 --> 43:34.280]  we're showing Pierce Morgan FBI.gov crime rate violent crime rates plunging I've
[43:34.280 --> 43:38.440]  got hundreds of pages of this so there's your proof you're the liar or you're
[43:38.440 --> 43:42.640]  ignorant nothing against Brits go back to your own country where there you may
[43:42.640 --> 43:46.200]  have hacking charges you know on him I guess he can't go back they may arrest him
[43:46.200 --> 43:49.720]  but what do you want to say to Pierce Morgan in closing and then what can we
[43:49.720 --> 43:53.120]  do to save the Republic is this not the ultimate assault we're about to see
[43:53.120 --> 43:58.840]  start it looks like we are at least the where we were after a Columbine we
[43:58.840 --> 44:05.040]  managed to get through that but it was because the American people communicated
[44:05.040 --> 44:10.880]  with their politicians and said don't buy into the media lie if you vote to take
[44:10.880 --> 44:17.720]  my guns away if you vote to restrict my ability to get and to carry guns I'm
[44:17.720 --> 44:22.840]  coming for you in the next election they've got to understand that this is a
[44:22.840 --> 44:27.920]  career-changing moment they're either going to be on the side of the Republic
[44:27.920 --> 44:33.160]  or against it if they want to be with Pierce Morgan that's fine but just
[44:33.160 --> 44:38.800]  remember there will be consequences well that's the big problem I've talked to
[44:38.800 --> 44:42.360]  top election fraud experts like Bev Harris who's nonpartisan she said she's
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.680]  never seen this much fraud and most the fraud was against Romney not that he was
[44:46.680 --> 44:50.640]  even good they the affix was in there too they stole the election that that's
[44:50.640 --> 44:54.120]  what I'm worried about Larry there's so much election fraud now they're about
[44:54.120 --> 44:58.240]  to legalize the 30 million illegals but they know this is their last shot
[44:58.240 --> 45:02.400]  because America is starting to wake up I'm not just saying that but that's why
[45:02.400 --> 45:06.760]  we're in so much danger folks is because we can beat the collectivists and so
[45:06.760 --> 45:11.760]  now they are like cornered zombies that's right they had to steal the last
[45:11.760 --> 45:16.600]  election or they could not have won and it's up to us to become part of the
[45:16.600 --> 45:21.320]  election machinery to become part of those officials that are sitting there
[45:21.320 --> 45:25.600]  it's a long day it's like five in the morning until seven eight at night maybe
[45:25.600 --> 45:30.640]  nine or ten at night it's a it's a killer day but it's either that or the
[45:30.640 --> 45:34.560]  Republic take your choice well I'm gonna say this right now and everybody out
[45:34.560 --> 45:37.920]  there so many people I know including combat veterans say when they come for
[45:37.920 --> 45:43.200]  the guns I'm gonna go Rambo folks let's go Rambo in the info war going in the
[45:43.200 --> 45:47.880]  police stations with literature waking them up going to your city councils going
[45:47.880 --> 45:52.160]  to your state houses going to your media calling in to talk radio calling the
[45:52.160 --> 45:56.720]  winehouse calling the NRA and saying you better not waffle because you know
[45:56.720 --> 46:01.280]  they're gonna give a press conference Larry and and Reuters is saying he may
[46:01.280 --> 46:05.480]  go dictator they're calling for him to use quote executive power and they're
[46:05.480 --> 46:08.880]  bragging that all these Republicans are about to line up I've talked to some
[46:08.880 --> 46:12.160]  people on the hill I know you've talked to more the word is a bunch of
[46:12.160 --> 46:17.120]  Republicans are gonna are gonna go with this because of campaign donations but
[46:17.120 --> 46:21.160]  can we hold the line or will these traders sell us out Larry is this it well
[46:21.160 --> 46:26.480]  that's the issue that you put your finger on it and it's up to us to make our
[46:26.480 --> 46:31.920]  voices heard if they realize that they may be hearing something on CNN and
[46:31.920 --> 46:38.440]  here's Morgan but if they hear something many times more coming from their
[46:38.440 --> 46:45.080]  grassroots they're gonna realize that the media is talking to itself and they
[46:45.080 --> 46:48.640]  better not go with the media because the media is not gonna protect them when
[46:48.640 --> 46:54.600]  we come to vote that's right God bless you gun owners.org folks they don't pay
[46:54.600 --> 46:59.280]  me say this though I'd love to get them as a sponsor ladies and gentlemen you
[46:59.280 --> 47:05.360]  are insane if you don't go sign up for a membership or a lifetime membership or
[47:05.360 --> 47:08.400]  if you don't go at least sign up for the free email alerts and they will give
[47:08.400 --> 47:13.800]  you up to the minute if the NRA was half as good as GLA we would not be in the
[47:13.800 --> 47:19.040]  situation the NRA supported the 68 gun control act in closing how do people go
[47:19.040 --> 47:23.000]  and sign up to be members or how do they just flat out donate Larry well you've
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.080]  told them gun owners.org is the easiest way if they can't get on the web it's
[47:27.080 --> 47:33.640]  triple eight double eight six guns eight eight eight eight six GUNS but gun
[47:33.640 --> 47:37.720]  owners.org is certainly the easiest now listen you're kind of the opposite of me
[47:37.720 --> 47:42.280]  and not in politics when it comes to your demeanor but but I mean I wear my
[47:42.280 --> 47:46.280]  emotions but also my brain when I thought about on my sleeve I think about
[47:46.280 --> 47:49.680]  things coldly but then I get on air and you know get hyped up because that's
[47:49.680 --> 47:55.560]  just how I am because this politics is war but but Larry you're somebody you
[47:55.560 --> 47:59.400]  know you got to go that always kind of downplace things just because you're the
[47:59.400 --> 48:04.840]  calm cool collected guy how bad is it I mean I'm here saying I've never seen
[48:04.840 --> 48:09.060]  anything like this my gut tells me but also politically red alert I mean is
[48:09.060 --> 48:13.760]  this death con one I mean is this like red alert sir yes sir it is as bad as it
[48:13.760 --> 48:20.080]  was after Columbine we were looking at a situation where gun control legislation
[48:20.080 --> 48:25.160]  looked to be inevitable well it wasn't and it wasn't because we stood up and we
[48:25.160 --> 48:31.360]  told the politicians go back in your hole don't even think about it or else
[48:31.360 --> 48:35.960]  you're not going to be around after the next election that's what we need to
[48:35.960 --> 48:40.280]  tell them absolutely the only problem is we now Clinton was leaving office we
[48:40.280 --> 48:46.280]  now have Obama not facing reelection for horrible cold years and he's talking
[48:46.280 --> 48:49.400]  about executive action in the media is telling him go ahead and do it we'll give
[48:49.400 --> 48:53.080]  you cover I think this is worse I think this is the worst we've ever faced it
[48:53.080 --> 48:57.040]  could be it certainly we've got a guy that doesn't seem to have any scruple
[48:57.040 --> 49:02.560]  about doing anything no matter how illegal and so it's up to us to put the
[49:02.560 --> 49:08.480]  heat primarily on the Republicans in the house and to tell them cut off the
[49:08.480 --> 49:13.600]  money because if there's no money for these rascals no money for these
[49:13.600 --> 49:18.680]  dictators they don't volunteer they'll go away and undoubtedly sir is it not
[49:18.680 --> 49:25.040]  dictatorship when the media says become a dictator oh when the media is
[49:25.040 --> 49:32.160]  applauding it makes it very likely that they're going to think my moment well it
[49:32.160 --> 49:38.160]  may be their moment to be defeated if we keep our wits about us and we don't
[49:38.160 --> 49:44.040]  fall for the inevitability notion that they're trying to give us that somehow

[55:17.640 --> 55:21.040]  come to my country and tell me give up my rights especially when I had a war with
[55:21.040 --> 55:26.200]  your king over this 200 something years ago punk kind of a touchy subject red

[55:31.080 --> 55:38.200]  Builderburg crash excuse me get out of my country scum while he's talking while
[55:38.200 --> 55:42.880]  he's talking while he's talking I'm gonna be showing statistics where their
[55:42.880 --> 55:46.440]  crime rate exploded in England highest in Europe ever they took the guns and how
[55:46.440 --> 55:51.400]  our crime rate is dropping guns are saving this country and they are taking
[55:51.400 --> 55:55.520]  each little crime making it huge on the news to give you the perception just like
[55:55.520 --> 55:59.560]  jaws made people think there were great whites eating everybody five great white
[55:59.560 --> 56:06.200]  deaths a year not real folks this isn't real let's start playing this piece of
[56:06.200 --> 56:10.840]  trash here it is I think we need to ban gun control laws that keep people from
[56:10.840 --> 56:15.480]  being able to protect themselves the problem is not going to go away if we
[56:15.480 --> 56:20.240]  banned this or that gun we've tried that that doesn't work doesn't even work in
[56:20.240 --> 56:23.720]  England you've had mass murders there all over Europe there have been mass
[56:23.720 --> 56:28.760]  murders the solution is for people to be able to defend themselves at the point
[56:28.760 --> 56:32.720]  of the crime and not wait for 20 minutes for the police to come what you
[56:32.720 --> 56:38.440]  just said Mr. Pratt was an absolute lie the gun murder rates in countries like
[56:38.440 --> 56:43.880]  Britain or Germany or Australia who've all suffered massacres many years ago
[56:43.880 --> 56:51.000]  similar nature have they are 35 people kill your your murder rate has your
[56:51.000 --> 56:58.200]  murder rate is lower than ours that is true you're violent crime rate they had
[56:58.200 --> 57:03.000]  a violent crime rate is higher than ours as is the violent crime rate in
[57:03.000 --> 57:09.360]  Australia America is not the the Wild West that you are depicting we only
[57:09.360 --> 57:14.080]  have the problem in our cities and and unhappily in our schools where people
[57:14.080 --> 57:19.040]  like you have been able to get laws put on the books that keep people from
[57:19.040 --> 57:23.920]  being able to defend themselves I honestly don't understand why you would
[57:23.920 --> 57:28.040]  rather have people be victims of a crime than be able to defend themselves it's
[57:28.040 --> 57:32.760]  incomprehensible you're not believed would be stupid man aren't you I it's
[57:32.760 --> 57:37.240]  seems to me that you're morally obtuse you seem to prefer being a victim to
[57:37.240 --> 57:41.920]  being able to prevail over the criminal element and I don't know why you want to
[57:41.920 --> 57:46.400]  be the criminals friend what a ridiculous argument you have absolutely no
[57:46.400 --> 57:51.320]  coherent argument whatsoever you don't do it you don't have no give a damn do
[57:51.320 --> 57:54.920]  you about the gun murder rate in America you don't actually care all you
[57:54.920 --> 58:03.640]  seem to me the facts don't seem to bounce right off of your head you're
[58:03.640 --> 58:09.280]  speaking oblivious can you answer my question your lives I'm answering your
[58:09.280 --> 58:13.800]  question I wish you could understand it because you'd like to see would you like
[58:13.800 --> 58:19.560]  to see people would you like to see teachers on you don't want to hear it

[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:59.640]  randomly we are entering authoritarianism but the gun culture laid down by our
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:04.280]  forebears in a fight against the Redcoats is now reactivating and is the
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:09.120]  number one shows all over TV the top 10 shows on cable half of them are gun
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.080]  shows everybody's getting into guns I told you we've been winning culturally
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:20.240]  but the Empire was going to strike with everything they've got and some stations
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.360]  don't carry this segment so whatever our guest talks about I want him to recap
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:30.480]  afterwards but I tell you my wife tells me she's never seen me this area she's
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.040]  never seen me work this much I've been working from like six in the morning
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:40.360]  until about midnight she says she's never seen me not smile and it's because
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.200]  folks my gut and intellectually I know they're coming down with both feet the
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.520]  whole future our country everything is going to be governed here and all of you
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.720]  out there to think that you are just going to turn your guns in or you don't
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.680]  have guns you idiots they're going to take everything they want the guns
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.200]  because that because they want to do stuff so bad they know with their
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.000]  computers that can predict future events in mass movements they admit this
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.320]  that there's going to be a resistance and we're going to win so they want to
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.400]  trick us into turning our guns in kind of like our forebears will do the
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.240]  Native Americans turn your weapons in will be your friends you were really
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.400]  done to do that you're going to a reservation if you get up and we're
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:22.120]  going to shoot you folks I'm not going to turn them in okay let me tell you this
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:26.240]  isn't just some garden variety tyranny the globalist are the nastiest the
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.200]  world's ever seen they put linen Stalin Mao and Hitler in on record
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.800]  congressional hearings the church hearings the other the Attacks Free
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.400]  Foundation hearings on it Stuart Rose we're going to break here in a minute
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:43.440]  well I obviously I want your take on all this but I mean we knew it was coming
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.760]  because the globalists like to brag but they're going to move with an executive
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.160]  order or just ATF rules and it looks like they may order semi-autos actually
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:56.200]  turned in if they think they can get away with it Stuart yes this is what we
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:01.160]  knew was was going to happen ever since the heller decision which left the door
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:07.000]  open to what the court called you know reasonable restrictions on the types of
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.240]  firearms that's why that was actually a defeat for the Second Amendment the
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:16.000]  Second Amendment was exactly about military weapons that's the whole point
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.240]  is to preserve the military of the capacity of the American people and so
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.400]  when they tell you we're not disarming you rolling it take away your assault
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:29.440]  rifles your military rifles that is exactly what the Second Amendment was
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.720]  meant to protect and so it is an attempt to disarm us this is going to be the
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:39.240]  fight that's right we come back I want to recap all that but Switzerland we're
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.640]  modeled if you people to say history off Switzerland and the Netherlands the
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.000]  Netherlands has since gotten rid of their local militias but for those that
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.600]  don't know Switzerland is modeled off of a 400 year old model in the Netherlands
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.400]  pirates would come in and raid the incredibly lucrative wealthiest ship
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.840]  yards in the world so that the locals organized armed with their own
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.680]  cannons their own little fortresses their own weapons the militia that was
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.960]  then picked up by the Swiss that's where we got it and the whole thing is
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.320]  about we are the military
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.160]  early that there was a whole point it was that was the founder's answer to that
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.560]  ancient question of who should guard the guardians is that the people themselves
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.920]  are the militia they are the military force inside the United States they're
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:32.840]  supposed to be capable of of resisting invasion of overthrowing the
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.800]  insurrectionists and we want to commit insurrection and for executing the law
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.640]  of the Union you're not capable of doing that unless you have military arms
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:45.680]  that's the whole point it's like trench cock County father said he said the
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.880]  Congress is no power to some of the militia their swords and every other
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.360]  terrible implement of the soldier are the birthright of an American the unlimited

[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.320]  can find individuals in the government who aren't bad people but our
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.720]  government's run by foreign mega corporations that brag they've conquered
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.960]  this country and now the government says they're taking our guns whether we

[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.720]  guns three discovery channel shows canceled in 24 hours one of them the
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:31.240]  second highest rated on the network they just canceled the other big show so
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:39.280]  that's actually four shows Ted Nugent high rated high rate because it was good
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.800]  looking women out there learning how to shoot men shooting target practice how
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.000]  to build guns I'm telling you I've been telling this for years the gun culture
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.880]  has been on fire I've been in the corporate meetings and you always sign
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.920]  non-disclosures with these but I can talk about the general fact of some of
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:00.760]  the people I've talked to discovery history A&E the production companies
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:10.680]  forum Tom Warner HBO BBC you gonna keep going here I was pitched American
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:16.760]  conspiracies so Ventura called his book by the BBC for court TV that became true
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:23.160]  TV six years ago Ventura was pitched that show that was my show not even
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.040]  care I wouldn't go through the trouble I said no I'm not gonna fly over the
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.000]  country and do all this be part of your show and have you control it I turned the
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.800]  thing down they even made a pilot that I put out of that I'm gonna go to
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.360]  Stuart Rhodes my point is is that I've been in these meetings and I've been in
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:41.440]  these meetings over the last 10 years so when I say I've turned down 10 I mean
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.560]  with contracts they're like oh you won't take $300,000 for the first season I
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.360]  know that's not a lot but most people don't get paid their first season the
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.000]  second it could be you know millions like you know Jesse James don't you want
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.400]  to be like Jesse James I'm like well no I actually know Jesse James by the way
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.120]  says will come on the show the point not name dropping either it's just all
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:05.040]  ridiculous the point is is that people think I'm joking about that I think it's
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.880]  time to drop the hammer just get those folks on the point is is that I've been
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:13.880]  in these meetings offered it and didn't do it because they can control it but
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.440]  even when they were controlling it I remember five six seven years ago they
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.600]  were going we know guns are the hottest thing we've done focus groups we've done
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.600]  test we know it'll get top ratings they won't let us well finally the damn
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:32.080]  broke and all they you see television all it is is gun shows now and the power
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.440]  structures like we're gonna lose it all because guns are American culture you're
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:41.280]  the military you're the civil defense and I showed last hour the FBI's new
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:47.160]  crime statistics or 21 years crime has been dropping but most of it the last
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.040]  five since gun ownership went totally insane and I'm gonna show you the 20
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.400]  year graphs the six year graphs the three-year graphs you're watching on
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.680]  info wars news.com if you're not I'll give you the URL the name it's FBI
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:04.800]  violent crime statistics FBI.gov they get on the news and they hoax you and they
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:09.400]  lie to you and they tell you that there's an epidemic of crime well it's an
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.520]  epidemic when one child gets kidnapped and killed you know they say ban
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.320]  electrical tape when somebody uses that to kill a little kid but over their
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:22.520]  nose and mouth no did the electrical tape do it no the point is is that some
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:26.360]  crazies always on psychotropic in every case I've seen go out and do this and
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.760]  they pick victim disarmament zones that have been advertised if why do you kill
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:35.440]  yourself I can go aim a gun at a cop or rob a bank no go out big and infamous
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.740]  you know you're a you're a drughead on anti-psychotic medication that makes you
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:43.720]  psychotic it says on the insert what is the media advertised public schools you
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.520]  go there there'll be nobody with guns you can go in and take out a couple
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:51.120]  classes for the cops get there when the cops get there they either shoot
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.840]  themselves or aim the gun at the cop and wait the police will tell you in
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:58.640]  every case because it's a sicko type which by the way fits mind control
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.800]  programming you can say they're either program which we know somewhere or or
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.920]  it's just cultural programming but that's what Manchurian candidates do
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.080]  after they commit a bunch of crime they dispose of themselves it's called
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:17.080]  disposal mechanism but regardless of that they are canceling top-rated shows
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:22.240]  that make millions of dollars a week I happen to know what these shows make
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:29.840]  millions a week a top-rated show on Discovery Channel can make five million
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.840]  dollars in one night guess how much one of those shows cost to make about five
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.000]  hundred thousand dollars their biggest ones a million some of my hundred
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.400]  thousand ladies and gentlemen they just turned loose of hundreds and hundreds of
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:47.120]  millions of dollars at Discovery alone and their entire winning lineup because
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.960]  they're owned by globalist and they know we're winning now I'm gonna shut up and
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:54.520]  give them the floor till we go to break but Stuart Rhodes is the founder and
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:57.440]  president of Oathkeepers wanting to tell folks about operations sleeping giant

[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:24.000]  does in 2004 where his paper solving the enemy combatant status one Yale's judge
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.040]  William E. Miller prize for best paper on the bill of rights he assisted
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.200]  teaching U.S. military history Yale history department was a Yale research

[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:48.440]  against Pittsburgh for arresting one of my reporters so he's a good lawyer at
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:52.600]  the same time constitutional lawyer Oathkeepers dot org and he also was
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.600]  retired from the army in a nighttime parachuting accident rough terrain
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.760]  which he luckily survived gun owners dot org was on last hour saying we're going
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.880]  into dictatorship basically agreeing Stuart Rhodes I think our only problem
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.280]  is underestimating how evil the enemy is not just intellectually at my gut
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:17.480]  level I have never been hammered like this with total prepare for you know war
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:22.040]  I mean my body is just a hundred percent on right now because you know your
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.360]  subconscious is more powerful it's able to stand all the data and it's telling
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.280]  me danger will Robinson Stuart Rhodes you're correct I mean they're going for
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:34.120]  the throat they're taking advantage of this mass murder of these little kids as
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.920]  their watershed event this is this is like the 9-11 for the right to bear
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.520]  arms and just like the neoconservatives went for the throat for the rest of the
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.320]  bill of rights the fourth fifth and sixth amendments in particular the anti gunners
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.440]  are going after the second amendment with the vengeance and as you said
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:57.800]  earlier it's not just Democrats you've got Peter King from New York you've got
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:04.520]  these horrendous you know so-called Republicans Rubio yes exactly they're
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.280]  all you know and they're buying the same line of nonsense that the
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:13.000]  Democrats are selling is that will assault weapons is not really protected
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.960]  not protected on the second amendment that we're not going to try to disarm you
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.240]  we're just taking away your assault weapons well that is the heart and soul
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.360]  of the second amendment is your military pattern explain that history to people
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.600]  you are you've taught history break it down you are the militia as you said
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:33.640]  earlier the American people were meant to be the military force of the nation
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:39.400]  the really good quote was from founding father Trish Cox who said the power of
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.200]  the sword and this is even speaking in favor of the new constitution back in
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:49.080]  1788 that the power of the sword says the minorities in the hands of Congress
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.800]  my friends and countrymen is not so but the powers of the sword and the hands of
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:59.240]  the humanry of America from 16 to 60 the militia of these free common wells
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.920]  entitled and accustomed to their arms when compared with any possible army
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.920]  must be tremendous and irresistible who are the militia are they not ourselves

[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.760]  attempt to disarm us by means of an assault weapons man give us your pledge
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:46.720]  here on air and I hope that others speak out with their pledge because we are the
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:51.200]  majority of people that know how to tie their shoelaces you know the welfare
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.640]  heads and stuff don't count we are the power in this country but we better
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.160]  exercise it now because because they're all conservatives are all going let's
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.000]  let the dust settle the children haven't been buried yet while while
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.080]  while conservatives are sitting back really out of fear of being demonized
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:10.080]  and while constitutionalist are the globalist are running around berserking
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:16.680]  pushing their hoax well yeah and what's happening now is you're finding out who
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:22.840]  the actual you know who the who the mealy-mouthed fake conservatives and
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:28.000]  fake constitutionalist really are all these big outlets that are taking guns
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.360]  off the shelf all these conservatives so-called conservatives who are now
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:37.040]  willing to put guns on the table and talk about a solid this ban these are
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.160]  people who never understood the right to bear arms never understood the
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.160]  constitution never understood liberty in the first place and so this is going to
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:49.680]  be a dividing issue among the the political right in this country the
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:54.240]  so-called political right and said fine we'll find out who is resolute and who
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:27:01.520]  is not anybody who will who will cow town to the disarmament fanatics is
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.480]  somebody who you should not support whether they're in politics whether they're
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:09.960]  in business you need to the name the name should be mud to you talk about your
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:13.000]  pledge I agree we'll talk about a strategy to defeat these enemies and they
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.280]  aren't authoritarian enemies folks but but but what is your pledge well my
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:20.160]  pledge and what this is my personal pledge of resistance against any attempt
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:25.400]  in disarm us I said look here's the situation my conscience and the urgency
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.840]  of our current situation compelled me to speak out I stewart rode as an American
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.280]  as a military veteran and as a father pledge the following I pledge to never
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.600]  disarm and in particular to never surrender my military pattern semi-automatic
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:42.520]  rifles and the full capacity magazines parts and ammunition and go with them
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:46.920]  regardless of what eligibility is taken by Congress the president or the courts
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:51.160]  I also pledge to pass on those military pattern rifles to my children and my
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.600]  children's children as well as the full capacity magazines parts ammunition they
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.200]  need to make them run regardless of what it was actually taken by Congress the
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:03.080]  president or the courts and then I quote founding father trench Cox about the
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:07.480]  power of the sword being in the hands of the people every every terrible
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.960]  implement of the soldier is their birthright and I say that that power of
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.960]  the sword and those terrible implements of the soldier include their battle
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:23.400]  rifles their battle carbines or m1a's or FNLAR's 1891's their Granz AK's AR's all
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:27.440]  the weapons listed as being targeted for Feinstein's so-called assault in his
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:31.080]  band the whole point of the Second Amendment is to preserve the military
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:35.440]  capacity of the American people and remember they would never say they
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:38.600]  wanted them even though they're on record saying they're gonna ban them when
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.560]  we would try to build support they would go we'll never take them that's a
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:46.560]  conspiracy theory they use military terminology of we're not assaulting you
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:50.840]  or like attacking during the Tet holiday I mean everything they do is
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.160]  military these are not just dumb liberals Stuart why do they want our guns
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:00.120]  well they want to be defenseless and their their eventual goal is complete
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:04.360]  disarmament they will tell you well sure we're not going to disarm you because
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.680]  we're gonna take any assault weapons and the next thing will be there'll be the
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:12.200]  scoped bolt action which they'll call sniper rifles and the next thing will be
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:16.200]  what was dangerous handguns you don't need a handgun like that you go duck
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:21.560]  hunting you'll be reduced down to a single shot shotgun or a 22 like in
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:25.440]  England and then they'll say well we're not disarming you we're just asking you
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:29.280]  to keep them down locked up the local gun range you can go ahead and go down
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.760]  there and target practice once in a while or check one out to go duck hunting
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:36.880]  then you got to return it back to the lock to save at the gun range and you're
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.520]  still not disarmed and then they ban Fox hunting and now they're banning duck
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:44.280]  hunting and they're doing it all over the world meanwhile the elites are all
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.640]  exempt from this we'll be right back to finish up your pledge and I'm gonna

[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:22.480]  on their attack on our second amendment they're covering up Benghazi where they
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:27.240]  admit tens of thousands of missiles including heat sinkers to shoot down
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:32.040]  aircraft shoulder-fired were given to the rebels to be brought into Syria the
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.640]  rebels are al-Qaeda so our government that's an article we ought to do that
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:42.440]  nobody's done our government the Obama administration is giving missiles any
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:48.200]  aircraft guns military weapons that we can't even get stuff that'll shoot down
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:55.400]  you know your passenger jets all day long they're giving them that they're
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:02.320]  giving them that and then covering it up while saying we should turn in our
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.360]  semi-automatic rifles and shotguns you notice Obama's like we want to ban the
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:10.240]  assault weapons but also handguns because they do and that's true that's
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.800]  actually most of the crime so see the assault rifles aren't even used in
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.800]  hardly I have the FBI statistics here we're gonna go over some of those the

[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:29.640]  go to drudgereport.com the irony is not lost on drudge British host slams
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.960]  Americans for guns says we should turn them all in and it shows a continental
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:40.440]  army person you know basically fighting back against the British redcoat and
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.880]  again nothing against the British people I mean a lot of my ancestors come
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:46.160]  from there Paul Watson's a great patriot most the British Parliament was
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:49.280]  against the war it's not an anti-you know British thing it's just that this
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:55.040]  guy's a slimy globalist here in our country telling us that we should turn
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:01.360]  our guns in and it's truly disgusting so that's up at drudgereport.com we're
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.480]  also making some of our own graphics showing him you know basically dressed
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:07.640]  up like the king of England next to Obama and others we're gonna be putting
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:11.720]  up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com it is so important right now
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:15.440]  ladies and gentlemen to understand that this is maker to break at time you
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:19.440]  either get really aggressive politically or you lose everything because
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:25.920]  again if they just took the guns yeah crime rates explode I'm not gonna follow
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.680]  it anyways I live in Texas I'm gonna defend myself because it's not that I'm
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:33.280]  living in fear I've it feels really good knowing I've got guns in my house and
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:37.440]  knowing the crime rate is incredibly low where I live some of the lowest in the
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:42.200]  country where I live because of the fact that criminals don't break in your
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:46.400]  house and we have the FBI statistics we're gonna show on that appears Morgan
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:50.560]  and I want to get a Stuart's take on that plays on the general public's
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:54.440]  ignorance because there is a perception that crime is gone up there's one type
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:00.040]  of crime that has gone way up petty crime where they know that the general
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:05.760]  public doesn't have guns your car parked with your purse in the front seat of
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.640]  your stereo when they see there's nobody there you leave your garage open you
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.360]  know your purse while you're at a restaurant you go to the bathroom that
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:19.360]  stuff's off the chart because criminals now are scared but all other violent
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:23.200]  crime home invasions I've got the statistics here they are plunging now
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:28.200]  Stuart I notice you also pledged to give aid to your friends and neighbors that
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:33.320]  you pledge to defend the Republic talk more about what you pledge I define it
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.680]  I just had it here we'll put it up on screen because I want to pledge with you
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:40.600]  I want to say here on air I think I'm gonna make a video about this that I
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:44.120]  pledged to never turn in my lawful illegal firearms that this is all a hoax
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.840]  and I pledge to expose the illegitimate occupational government we have that
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:54.000]  openly isn't becoming a dictatorship and I pledge my my name my treasure my
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.360]  honor my family to it you know I've pledged to call for secession to
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:02.040]  reconstitute the Republic and that got a lot of national attention because I knew
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:07.240]  this was coming but but I agree it's time for police military you already saw
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:14.560]  that state judge which is like the mayor out midland come out and say that you
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.240]  know the county judge that we know they're coming for the guns and we
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:20.840]  ought to find that clip I mean people know what's coming and now it's here and
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:26.320]  like you said they want to just try to slip it in Stuart where oh it's not an
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.840]  attack we're just gonna take your guns oh look the Republicans agree all right
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:33.840]  you know the stores quit selling them the shows aren't on now the culture's
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.320]  dirty and bad they actually said that Fox has announced they're not gonna show
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:42.360]  Christmas shows that show children in school just showing children in school
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:48.360]  I'm not kidding folks that's mainstream news that's improper now
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:51.120]  I'm gonna go out to my truck during the next break and pull that article on
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.720]  actually show people you can't even show children in school they're pulling
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:58.400]  shows cuz just children in schools too frightening for us it's this in any
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.400]  thing of mind control while the people running this are arming terrorists
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:06.520]  murdering people all over the world spying on us running the drugs into the
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:11.120]  country they're trying to just absolutely put us under mind control so
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:16.080]  skirt finish up your pledge and then let's get into Pierce Morgan and then
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:22.140]  some phone calls I read the whole thing is the highlights I mean just the end
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:25.560]  part read wherever you want go ahead I mean you got about halfway through it
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.520]  yeah the whole point of second amendment is preserve the military capacity
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:32.800]  American people to preserve the ability of the people who are the militia to
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.080]  provide for their own security as individuals as neighborhoods towns
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:40.560]  counties and states during any emergency man made or natural to preserve the
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.280]  military capacity American people to resist tyranny and violations their
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.560]  rights by oath breakers within government and preserve the military
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:50.880]  capacity that people defend the Constitution against all enemies both
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:54.240]  foreign domestic including those oath breaking domestic enemies within
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.560]  government is not about hunting that's core the second amendment is also not
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.320]  really even about self-defense against private criminals about self-defense
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.320]  against public criminals against tyrants
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.360]  whispers and foreign invaders above above all of the firearms currently
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.560]  available to American citizen modern military pattern
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:17.040]  semi-automatic rifles provide that military capacity protecting and keeping
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:20.960]  and bearing of such arms of military utility as the heart and soul second
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:26.000]  amendment thus any attempt to ban their possession sale purchase or transfer is
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.240]  an attempt to disarm the American people that's the biggest point I want to
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.880]  make is that this is disarmament you don't wait for them to get to your bolt
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.240]  to action or your 22 or your handgun you stop them when they're trying to take
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:43.120]  away your battle rifle because the most effective weapon you own right now they've
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:49.040]  been able to freeze our technological capacity for self-defense at like 1934
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.720]  levels while they continue to progress with what predator drones everything else
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:59.360]  so one one thing we should not do is give up the last you know mediocre and
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:03.320]  limited capacity we still have our military capacity is supposed to be a
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:07.280]  lot stronger than this but we the people have a lot of the atrophy and a lot of
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:11.520]  litter away so we cannot back up any further we must be wanting to resolutely
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:16.560]  stand and say we will not comply we will nullify as individuals as
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:22.920]  communities as states we will refuse to obey and we will resist including mutual
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:29.200]  defense let me just read from the Hill house dim turn in your guns this is the
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:33.840]  woman that put TSA on the buses and highways in Houston sticking hands down
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:37.680]  pants and searching bags without warrants until the city council stopped her
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:42.640]  because our listeners went and protested it this is a pig of a tyrant
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:48.760]  representative Sheila pig Jackson Lee on Wednesday afternoon the tyrant urged
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:51.280]  people to turn in their guns let me just read it without saying that
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.800]  representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas what a shame on Wednesday afternoon
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:59.680]  urged people to turn in their guns arguing it would be an appropriate
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:03.600]  response to last week's mass shooting in Newtown yeah so the psychopaths can
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:08.240]  kill us I would this is a quote I would personally just say to those who were
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:12.320]  listening maybe you want to turn in your guns Jackson Lee said on the house
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:17.360]  floor oh no I'm not going to take your guns see that's IOP but look at what
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:21.560]  Dick's Sporting Goods did they wanted to be part of the solution and part of
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.320]  America oh see if you're part of America you turn your guns in Dick's
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:28.640]  Sporting Goods announced this week that it would stop selling and displaying and
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:32.040]  a lot of stores are just pulling guns entirely Walmart says they may just pull
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:36.760]  everything they pulled rifles semi-autos this is unbelievable that's the
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:41.360]  Hill I mean I mean this is unprecedented how they want to create this
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:47.240]  illusion that America just decided it was time to turn their guns insert well
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:52.120]  here that's one half of America the other half of America is now more
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:57.240]  resolute than ever I think the attempt to repeat the assault with span will have
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:02.680]  a very different outcome I think the the mindset of gun owners that I know
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:07.960]  anyway have hardened considerably the last assault would span was ridiculous
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:12.680]  it was insulting it was a gross violation of our rights and I think the
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.640]  attitude since then has changed quite a bit you'll have more resistance and
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.920]  frankly I think it'll spark a civil war I think that when they try to do this if
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:24.800]  they if they're successful like the mealymouth Republicans go along with
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:32.520]  this go along with this kind of stuff they will place us at April 19th 1775
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:36.160]  that's what we're going to be and all we'll take is the first gun owner who
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:42.040]  fights back and it'll kick off and it'll be a spiral from there that's what I
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.480]  don't know sure I will agree with you that I think that they probably do want
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:48.080]  that because if you look at all the military training now civilian inmate
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:52.400]  labor camps training to cordon cities the Army manuals training to confiscate
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:56.160]  guns in America they've trained the military what I found it's done is
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:59.160]  actually woken up the military that heard me you know 15 years ago in the
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:02.600]  air and thought this is extreme I've talked to so many active do they say
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:06.240]  no that's what woke us up because what we're taught now is what you said what
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.800]  happened same thing with police I do you know see all more and more of them
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.000]  waking up they don't care they just get rid of them and bring in you know total
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.360]  authoritarians or people that will follow orders but we've seen miscalculations
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.360]  you know in the documentaries and in congressional hearings on Waco massacre
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:29.960]  in 93 we know that ATF went to raid they found a group that was weird found a
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:33.080]  group doing some strange stuff they exaggerated a lot of it but I'm not
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:36.960]  depending what the Davidians were doing they went in found a multiracial group
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:42.200]  called them racist as well opened fire on them Davidians fought back so then
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:46.040]  they surrounded them burned them down so the Davidians did it but the there's
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:49.280]  footage of the ATF loading their cameras and it came out in hearings later in
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:54.600]  their own internal documents that they were gonna go kill those people call them
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.600]  a cult and use that as the kickoff of Ruby Ridge to to start disarming
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:03.800]  Americans and just calling everyone a terrorist who wouldn't but that rollout
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:06.960]  didn't work so they kind of went with the McVeigh thing that didn't work too
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:10.200]  well so they went with Muslim terrorists in the next staged event now
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:13.680]  they're going back to Patriots doing it what is it about the globalist because
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:17.760]  they're smart to a point but a lot of things they do don't they get that
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:21.480]  people now know they're staging stuff don't they get people now know sir hand
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:27.320]  sir hand was staged in RFK to get the 68 act passed don't they know they're not
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:31.560]  operating in a vacuum now because they've got to know it will cause the
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:36.440]  civil war and they've got to know they're going to lose your take on that
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:42.200]  Stewart well I mean they're there they're Psyops work on a large percent of the
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.960]  population you can look at the you know more of a mainstream reaction of course
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:52.520]  as they show you on TV but the Psyops as you've said don't work on a very
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:56.480]  significant portion and that's the freedom movement which is growing by
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.240]  leaps and bounds and it's current within the ranks of the military and police
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:04.520]  also the police and rank and file the military rank and file no firearms this
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.520]  is the great weakness is that these guys understand firearms they understand
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:12.840]  what's necessary to save your own life it's not attacking you and so they're
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:18.680]  not going to buy it their their sellout perfume princess no commanders might you
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:23.800]  know the generals who sold out the the state police chiefs and you know the
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:27.080]  ones they parade in front of the camera might have sold out but the rank and
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:31.120]  file have not and they understand the reality of the violence they understand
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:36.000]  the necessity of being armed and they're not going to buy it and so now you're
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.840]  going to have a problem and they think that they're going to go along with it
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:41.840]  but I think a large percentage of them will not there's gonna be a division
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:46.160]  within the ranks and this only helps us this actually helps us quite a bit
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.960]  because all those guys come back from Iraq Afghanistan and they have an M4 in
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:54.080]  their closet the semi-automatic version what they carried in Iraq and at
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:58.520]  Afghanistan as far as they're concerned that's their rifle for their life you
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:02.320]  know forever to defend themselves and they're not gonna turn them in and the
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:05.680]  guys who are still in have the same mindset about their personal weapons
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:09.600]  and so they've kind of created their own worst enemy in many ways which is why
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:14.200]  they're so afraid of veterans yeah for those that don't know sometimes people
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:17.480]  email me and go I thought you were making it up when you said veterans were
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:21.360]  the number one terrorist and that 90% of Homeland Security preparation is to
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:24.960]  fight veterans I thought you were making it up that the explorer scouts are
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:28.000]  training to go door-to-door and take guns I went and saw it in the New York
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.320]  Times I went and saw the documents you got it's true yeah that is crazy that
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.980]  Homeland Security is really for veterans but it's not when you understand
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:41.200]  Homeland Security is a foreign occupying force and that's why I'm
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.600]  telling people they have looked at the metrics they know the Liberty movement
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:50.160]  is winning and that's why they've had to steal elections that's why they've had
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.880]  to claim there's a mandate for socialism that's actually a desperate
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:47:00.000]  attempt to hoax us into their control and the globalists don't care if cops and
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.120]  police died trying to take our guns so you need to understand folks it looks
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:07.840]  like a civil war maybe what they're planning and look how right we've been
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:12.760]  so far so heaven help us ladies and gentlemen we have got to get in their
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:18.040]  face and let them know we're not putting up with it and you've got to melt
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:23.800]  Republican House phone numbers and tell them listen I'm gonna campaign against
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:27.440]  you full-time or I'm gonna run against you if you don't stop this traitorous
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:31.720]  garbage and where are the Republicans with the FBI crime statistics I'm gonna
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:34.800]  show those we're gonna break and come back and take calls where are they
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:38.920]  showing that for 20 years crime rates violent crime has been plunging and
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:43.000]  home invasions have been plunging and then you go to the FBI has interactive
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.640]  maps of every state in every city and wherever there's gun control is where
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.000]  you have the high crime I'm gonna show people watching on TV some of this but
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.600]  radio listeners just go to FBI.gov type in violent crime statistics Stuart talk
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:00.080]  about that while I show people these documents well the big point I want to
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:04.160]  make is that it's like you said that these Republicans are not defending you
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:08.600]  like they should they should be going on the attack they should be calling this
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:14.120]  what it is a disgusting blood-dancing manipulation of the population and
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:18.680]  taking advantage political advantage of the tragic death of children they
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:23.280]  should be calling this out but instead they're going along with it they're
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:26.920]  saying oh yes things have changed now it's like 9-11 things have changed we've
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:31.160]  got to go along with with sacrificing our rights because the death of 20 people
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:35.800]  you know 27 people outweighs the rights of all of us and our
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.560]  posterity and our defense against a limited government and so we need to call
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:44.640]  them out you know one of my pledges that I pledge that I will oppose and
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:49.720]  purge out of office anybody of any party who votes for this nonsense I don't
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:53.800]  care if they're you're told that the lesser two evils from now on the name is
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.480]  mud you should purge them out and the only way you're ever going to avoid
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.760]  having to fight another civil war in this country is if you make it very clear
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:06.240]  that you are no longer going to support oath breakers if they violate their oath
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:10.840]  by voting for this nonsense or otherwise violate their oath like for the NDAA and
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:15.520]  things like that you should not support them you cannot say you're keeping your
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:18.800]  oath to defend the Constitution while also voting for an oath breaking
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:22.280]  politician and the reason why you're not defending the Constitution is because
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:26.040]  when they violate their oath by passing an assault on his band it will
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:30.360]  compel us to fight that'll be it there'll be no more election cycle three three or
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:35.560]  four years down the road to fix things by voting in supposed conservatives and
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:39.480]  then saying well we'll get to them later on this is it folks if you don't stand
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:42.960]  hard now and let them know that you will not support them ever again if they
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:45.880]  vote for this they will vote for it because they know you'll vote for them
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:49.340]  anyway if you tell the oath breakers will vote for you because they're the
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:52.960]  lesser two evils why should they not go exactly let's be clear the same
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:56.680]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan gang was taken down Europe and others they're the
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:00.280]  number one givers to anti-gun stuff they're financing these Republicans
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:05.200]  they're not doing that they know it's a Psyop they know all this gun turning in
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.720]  business is just meant to be a hyped up deal but they want to move up the ranks
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:14.680]  they want power just like Boehner is up there saying okay we'll accept all of
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:19.600]  Obama's tax increases because he was put in there as a globalist protege of New
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:23.840]  Cambridge who wrote the forward to Alvin and Heidi Toffler's books calling for
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:27.960]  world government and in planning you and your family with microchips I mean
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:32.120]  these are these are authoritarian globalist and your guns are in their
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:36.000]  way and they know the words getting out that crimes dropping where there's guns
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:41.520]  so they this is the Empire striking back they are striking back right now
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:46.040]  against the Republic because at the current growth rate we're gonna beat
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:51.640]  them very soon okay they know that they know that whether it's liberal women or
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:56.080]  illegal aliens they're out getting guns everybody wants guns everybody gets it
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:00.760]  look at Mexico where they took the guns highest crime rate in the world
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:06.440]  strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:10.800]  about how do I safeguard renowned author and expert Joel Scowzen the U.S.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:14.680]  isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:18.960]  threat they know that a massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:23.120]  to come told Scowzen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:27.760]  strategic relocation and the securing of your home what I tell people is that you
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:31.680]  do have time we talk about natural disasters the health environment we
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:35.560]  talk about pollution the water quality my personal experience about being in
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:38.920]  every one of these states most people want to be ready won't be able to get
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:43.000]  out of town because there'll be absolute panic there is no preparedness
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  without strategy this Christmas give the gift of preparedness strategic

[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:24.840]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:28.640]  that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the liberals and
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:32.520]  the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just created a

[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:20.560]  a great pleasure to talk to you again but concerning the fact that they're
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:28.480]  going to be taking away a lot of guns from guys are going to be trying to one
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:33.480]  of the primary targets from what I understand is going to be guys on a
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:39.640]  cyclist that the military has that's right and they put people on that by the
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:43.400]  millions made up and there's no they've said they're going to just put you on a
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:46.520]  list and come take your guns then that's going to cause people to fight back
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:52.880]  then you're going to be called terrorist yeah but the thing is though my
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:56:01.760]  kid brother is still in and he's a high ranking enlisted in the army and he has
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:09.760]  told me emphatically that they as soon as things go from bad to worse they've
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:17.560]  got the UN and NATO forces both posed and ready to move in on this country no
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:22.120]  no that's in NLE09 that's in the Washington Post see people don't get
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:27.520]  this it's official they're going to use foreign troops on us Stuart Rhodes you've
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:33.360]  gotten any comments on that well it's exactly why one of our top 10 orders we
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:37.640]  will not obey there's any orders to assist in the use of foreign troops in
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.480]  American soil but frankly I hope they try it because that'll do that'll be the
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:46.200]  thing that gets most Americans off the fence in fact it was the British
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:51.680]  bringing in the Germans that finally turned the tide in 1777 that's correct
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:56.200]  that the use of the Hessians is what did it and that happened before it's one of
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:00.800]  the reasons why people switched their their thinking from reconciliation to
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:05.600]  independence because in 1775 before they declared independence a lot of them
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:09.440]  were still thinking about reconciling when they brought the Hessian mercenaries
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:13.000]  through New Jersey and they raped and pillaged and burned their way through
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.560]  that's what ticked off a lot of the Americans and said okay that's it we're
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:21.680]  going to declare independence and it's it will happen again I hope they do that
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:26.080]  if they're going to use force against us I hope they bring in foreign troops and
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:29.200]  UN troops I really do yeah that's well listen that's what they're preparing for

[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:36.560]  propaganda defeat for them but that's what I mean they're so disconnected and
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.800]  they're so glow I see all the liberal sites saying let's bring in UN troops

[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:49.840]  admitting the truth is gonna get us out of this look you think I like being at
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:54.120]  the very front of the spear on this well I kind of do but I don't mind if I
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:56.920]  mean I don't want to die but whatever happens happens and that's why I
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:00.880]  understand Stewart Rhodes it's not macho up here saying you know he pledges to
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:06.000]  resist these people it's it's just what we got to do I mean look I'll be honest

[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.640]  it I want to go to your calls and shut up Stewart Rhodes actually with us the
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:28.720]  bottom of the hour he wants to talk about solutions about a counter this but
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:32.880]  let's let's get to some of these calls right now the solution is get involved
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:37.120]  in Oathkeepers the solution is operation sleeping giant we're gonna talk about it
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:40.960]  Sean Arizona finish up with the unit you're saying that your brothers and
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:45.760]  saying they're waking up go ahead and finish your point yeah there's a
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:51.960]  about 200 in a unit he said about 150 of them are well awake now thanks to you
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:59.520]  and a couple others and they are very grateful for your show and those others
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:03.720]  well they may not be here forever so people better get this information check
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:07.920]  it out for themselves and prepare to be infall warriors in their own sectors go
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:13.480]  ahead yeah well they are in that area where they're at I won't mention that
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:20.000]  but they're very much info warriors and where they're at they also send the
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.840]  information back home to their different areas well that's the key is to
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:27.960]  savage the enemy every minute we've still got the internet like it's not
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:32.280]  gonna be there tomorrow Stewart Rhodes you have any comments to this fellow well
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:36.520]  no this could do what you're doing and what he said is mirrors what I've heard
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.880]  across the board also is that in many military units they're having these
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:45.120]  discussions are paying attention and this is the this is the great victory we
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:50.360]  have in the internet the freedom of speech on the internet and on radio is
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:54.200]  what's turning the tide and the powers that they know that and it's turning the
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:57.560]  tide in the ranks I would just encourage people to really focus the
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:01.680]  liberty movement is a focus on the guys with the guns it is so incredibly
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:07.760]  important you might not get a chance to vote for Rand Paul in 2016 stop looking
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:12.880]  only at politics focus on the guys with the guns I just urge you I don't care
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:18.000]  if you do it through oath keepers or how you do it hand out DVDs turn them on to
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.280]  your radio show whatever it takes wake them up if you want to help us that's
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:26.920]  what we're trying to do we got a concert coming up and get up on January 18th
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:31.320]  outside of Fort Hood a free concert from troops you want to help us come to
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:36.080]  oath keepers look up Liberty tour.org and help us get that concert going help
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:39.560]  us put up billboards but go out there and talk to the troops pass out that's
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:42.960]  right you're having to put billboards up because now the army war college is
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:47.480]  taking in data saying the next war is with the Tea Party that's treason folks
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:52.400]  we got to put billboards up out front all those bases with info war they're

[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:06.520]  treason it's one of our billboards put up a billboard that says the assault weapons
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:10.680]  ban is treason and he attempted to saw the American people is treason what's

[02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:19.280]  worth of Fort Riley so they're there and the main point is is the troops here
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:22.560]  and they can't do anything about that how they're gonna stop that they can't
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:26.760]  stop it so folks don't get a billboard exactly folks a few thousand bucks huge
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:31.240]  billboard outside the base savage the enemy engage them they are attacking us
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:35.400]  with dead children right now saying we did it okay you got to get back with the
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:38.840]  truth and hammer them hard or they're gonna win they are to use military
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:43.360]  terminology because that's what this is we are being overrun right now okay we

[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:32.920]  ladies and gentlemen this is war against tyranny they declared war on us
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:37.760]  I've sat here and chronicled the crimes of these sicko globalist anti-human
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:42.560]  abortion loving world government pushing trash jacking our food our water
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:46.800]  breaking down our society trying to disarm us they've already bankrupted the

[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:56.600]  people I declare info war on them and if you will simply start attacking them you
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:01.160]  didn't realize this this is like putting crosshairs on somebody and pulling the
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:06.760]  trigger politically when you expose there a bunch of zombies vampires using
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:10.920]  dead children to take our guns when they're about your war mongering
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:15.400]  criminals like Obama Walter Jones congressman said he's guilty of war
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:21.800]  crimes yesterday on this show he is under law funding al-qaeda hey Obama you
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:25.360]  gonna cry for all the Mexican kids killed by fast and furious you did as a
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:30.480]  false flag to blame the second amendment get back in their dirty face get back
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:34.320]  in their face and stop being cowards oh they may put me on a list they may come
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:38.880]  get me folks if you give into that fear it's over I'm all in I'm with Stewart
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:43.200]  Rhodes I will never submit to the New World Order I will never go along with
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:47.640]  them I stand against them no matter what happens and they can kill us
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:51.120]  individually they can politically destroy us they can assassinate our
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:56.080]  character but it's still a fraud God knows who you really are and they can
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:00.520]  kill your body but they can't kill your soul and they can't kill your ideas like
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:04.600]  V says after they just sprayed him with bullets and he's got the bad guy the
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:10.160]  dictator he's got him right there and he says flesh and blood can die but ideas
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:17.000]  ideas are bulletproof and that's when you really start living when you step
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.560]  across from the fear and step into an idea that's what life's all really about
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:27.920]  because these globalists are the scum of the earth and they are scared of you
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:31.720]  you have power they tell you you don't have power all day they're trying to
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:34.720]  break your will I want to jam it a bunch of calls in the final segment which
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:39.080]  Stewart he's got some ideas to counter this and turn this around we're gonna
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:43.640]  put out here as well but I want to play this clip of Tom head out in what is it
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:48.480]  Midland one of the most popular cities out in West Texas who said a few months
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:51.840]  for the election he said look they're gonna probably put Obama in he's gonna
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:55.480]  come through the guns and try to bring the UN in that's an oversimplification
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:59.440]  but and people are gonna resist there's gonna be a civil war I need deputies to
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:05.000]  stand up against the UN occupied federal government and folks that's
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:10.040]  because that's a big city out there a good size town that's because they're
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:13.640]  telling them this that's why the the police are on tape on the TV show
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:17.960]  nodding their heads with them yes yes that's right because folks as crazy as
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:22.600]  it sounds the globalists really think they're gonna take over America bankrupt
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:26.560]  things and put us in reeducation camps like Harry Balafonte said last week on
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:32.320]  Al Sharpton show on on on MSNBC and you're like well that'll never happen here
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:36.360]  really Obama health care will ever happen here 53 million abortions will
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:41.080]  never happen here it's all the NSA never spelling you without warrants here the
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:45.440]  TSA never be on highway checkpoints now training the police they're allowed to
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:49.920]  go in your body in a non-emergency situation just as a routine track it's
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:54.000]  traffic stop now the state police of Texas are starting this because the feds
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.440]  told them they could do it I mean it's it's it's we're already in the tyranny
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:02.880]  but there's still the old republic left vestigial parts of it we can reignite
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:07.200]  those and restore the Republic here's that quick clip he's gonna try to hand
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:11.400]  over the sovereignty of the United States to the UN mm-hmm okay what's gonna
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:14.520]  happen when that happens I'm thinking worst-case scenario right right I
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:19.800]  understand civil unrest civil disobedience civil war maybe and we're
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:24.120]  not talking just a few riots here and demonstrations we're talking we're
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:29.280]  talking Lexington Concord take up arms and get rid of the guy mm-hmm okay now
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:33.000]  what's gonna happen if we do that if the public decides to do that he's gonna
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:38.680]  send in UN troops I don't want them in Lubbock County mm-hmm okay so I'm gonna
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:41.360]  stand in front of their person armored personnel carriers and say you're not
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:44.900]  coming in here mm-hmm and the sheriff I've already asked him I said you gonna
[02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:47.880]  back me he said yeah I'll back you well I don't want a bunch of rookies back
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:53.960]  there true I want trained he quit that's enough reason he goes on to say that he
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.680]  wants a tax increase to create a larger County militia he's just call out a
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:02.560]  posse and train him that'd be free basically the local restaurants would
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:05.880]  provide all the food and stuff and and prepare and people go that well that's
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:09.800]  crazy no that's America what sounds crazy because we've been domesticated is
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:13.860]  America we should be forming counties and cities saying we don't care if you
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:18.600]  announced we're under world government we're not going along with this okay it's
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:23.080]  now time to say the people are awakening or it's all the way Stewart
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:27.440]  Rhodes comments to this and we're gonna go back to calls well it is right and
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:31.080]  and the thing that you can always point to is look as you were saying earlier
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:36.320]  you know the NSA is spying on Americans that is not something that's that's you
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:40.680]  know only a future possibility Obama does have a kill list of American
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:45.320]  citizens who's going to kill he has already killed American citizens he has
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:48.320]  claimed the right to kill American citizens they've claimed the right to
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:52.920]  apply the laws of war to you not just through the NDA but even before that
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:56.200]  they've done this and so these are things that are not conspiracy theory I
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:59.720]  mean this this is why I found an oathkeeper they realized how close we
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:04.920]  were to going down the same path is not to Germany and we're on it and they've
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:09.320]  gotten rid of they pretty much gutted the rest of the Bill of Rights the fourth
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:15.280]  fifth and six amendments are for all intents and purposes dead and what's left
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:22.000]  is simply to disarm you and then go ahead and use the infrastructure they've
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.400]  already created that they they've made a very plain it's right there in your
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:30.760]  face in the law right there in the executive orders admitted in court
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:34.040]  things that they've already done and so now they're just you know this is the
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:38.440]  next step is to disarm you if you let them disarm you you should have fought
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:42.480]  back you should have resisted during the Bush years when the neocons were
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:46.280]  gutting the Bill of Rights and they were the war on terror but you didn't stand
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:50.000]  up then so now you're gonna have to stand up when they're coming for your guns
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.280]  that's what it takes like I said last week if that's what it takes and bring
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:59.240]  it on if this is what it takes to wake up conservatives to finally purge out the
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:03.600]  oathbreakers within their own party this was so disgusting about it is like you
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:07.400]  you saw what happened at the RNC I was there like watching a Nuremberg rally
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:11.240]  they're cheering for John McCain a friggin traitor to the Constitution who
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:15.000]  wrote the detention provisions of the NDAA the man should be hanging from a
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.320]  noose after being tried and convicted of treason and being executed that's what
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:23.800]  he deserves but instead he gets a standing ovation from Republicans and so
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:28.440]  it's disgusting that they have let the Constitution be destroyed so much that
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:32.800]  the last thing that's left the last impediment the total tyranny is still the
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:37.760]  second amendment and so now are they gonna fight for it we'll see the
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:40.960]  Republicans in Congress I don't think they will unless you hold their feet to
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:45.280]  the fire make it clear that you're gonna purge them out but I'm not even sure it
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:48.080]  might be too late for that they might still go ahead and go along with it
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:51.840]  because you have voted for them in the past this is why I'm so upset with
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:56.520]  people who are otherwise good Americans who continued to vote for oathbreakers
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:01.520]  because they were afraid as you said earlier you cannot let fear drive you
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:07.320]  and if you're someone like my friend Sheriff Mack unfortunately who voted for
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:11.760]  Romney and supported Romney out of fear of Obama that's the reason why we're in
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:15.480]  the situation where we are now where we may have to fight because people let
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:19.680]  their fear drive them into violating their principles and voting for oath
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:25.000]  breaking Republicans who are now in office still sitting there reelected who
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  are going to go along with this crap so we have to stop that that's our last
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:33.960]  possible chance is to purge the oathbreakers out of office from both
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:39.200]  sides Republicans and Democrats purge them out this is what Jefferson and
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:43.640]  Madison did back in 1798 against the aliens edition acts I agree I agree we
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:48.840]  do not have a garden variety corruption either we have the nastiest dehumanizing
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:52.880]  eugenics based system folks these are people that want world government to
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:57.320]  kill you and I saw a YouTube comment today I meant to print it but only printed
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:00.960]  part of it guys can you go find this and expand the comments I get the full
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:04.920]  comment because these here I'll give it to you because these comments are an
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:10.160]  indicative of what the demo of what Democrats say to me and they say you're
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:13.040]  crazy we're going to take your guns and put you in a forced labor camp and we're
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:15.720]  going to kill you because you're a bad right winger when I'm just a
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:21.040]  constitutionalist I'm beyond their left right garbage and they say well yeah
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:24.560]  we're taking your guns because you're a right winger but but but but you're a
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:30.480]  kook thinking we want to take your guns it's like these collectivists can't
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:35.120]  even think Stuart they're really bizarre people let's go to Ronnie in Utah says he
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:38.160]  spoke with a congressman that's something wants to tell us then Mark and
[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:43.200]  Alex and Kent and others go ahead Ronnie I thank Alex for taking the call I
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:48.720]  just like to get Stuart's take on this they just called my congressman Jason
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:54.840]  Chavis taught one of his aides and you explore the tyranny in a little order you
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:18:01.160]  tell them about the 60 billion dollar bill on Sandy in the 13 15 billion the
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:06.960]  sport battle battle projects and on and on and on and the guns and the tyranny
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:12.600]  and the aides are like well all types of comments on so I mean it's just amazing
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:17.400]  well listen calling them isn't bad it's better to write them a letter it's also
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:19.920]  better to go when they go to these public speaking events like at the grocery
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:24.360]  store of the church to go and call them out remember at the original Ron Paul
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:28.560]  tea parties for the republicans took them over and yelled at them people went
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:33.280]  and shouted republicans and democrats down that's what we need is that
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:37.400]  see republicans came in took it over you never saw that again we need the tea
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:42.640]  party to go in and get in the face physically listen I've stormed the Texas
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.960]  Capitol twice and they didn't arrest me because they knew I legally was able to
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:51.800]  go in there with 500 people or whatever and get in their face and if they would
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:54.480]  have arrested me that would have given it all the attention still got the
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:58.040]  attention so I stormed it twice I went down to the federal building and people
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:01.440]  are so cowardly they go there's no way he went in the federal building and told
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:04.560]  him that he was allowed to film them and don't you know how dare them I mean
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:09.520]  people are so cowardly they think like the Texas Capitol footage is fake or and
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:13.120]  it's not that I'm even some tough guy we've got to get back in their face and
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:16.880]  tell them they're wrong or they're going to dominate us and convert fully to
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:21.280]  tyranny I do this because I'm afraid of them winning because the real danger is
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:27.480]  in it is in submitting Stuart Rhodes well sure you gotta get in the face of the
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:31.320]  anti gunners but also need to get in the face of the so-called republican
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:36.240]  allies of the Second Amendment makes it very clear to them that we do consider
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:39.840]  this disarmament and they vote for it they're done when you have to pound it
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:43.560]  into their heads and you should confront them the best way to confront them is in
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:48.520]  a public forum put pressure on them bring 20 30 people with you because they
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:52.360]  perceive that as their vote that's all they care about is their own political
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:56.320]  skin most of them have no integrity left at all and the only one on the way you
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:59.840]  gonna get through to them is making fear for their political future if they
[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:03.160]  are gonna skip this network break here I just an egging that announcement
[02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:07.680]  because it's so important to go back to calls folks you have to let them know by
[02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:11.720]  the way I know you think I'm stupid and and you think my incremental steps you
[02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:14.800]  are gonna get our guns I'm gonna do whatever it takes investigating your
[02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:20.160]  finances as a citizen journalist you name it until we bring you down is that
[02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:24.000]  clear scum and believe me it gets their attention they suddenly look at you and
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:27.960]  start sweating when they know you can see them it's time to let them know
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:35.240]  listen would be dictator I see you do you got it go ahead I'm sorry no you're
[02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:38.680]  right but like I said you need to put pressure on them I wouldn't bother
[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:43.240]  calling if you want to call all you gotta say is is let him know who votes for
[02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:46.640]  this he's done that's all you gotta do don't try to change your mind don't
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:51.080]  write long eloquent dissertations just tell them you vote for that you're done
[02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:55.800]  and by the way your former constable former staffer of Ron Paul on the hill
[02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:58.880]  so you know what you're talking about your constitutional lawyer and veteran
[02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:02.200]  and founder of both keepers I should add for listeners that just tuned in what
[02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:05.200]  Stuart Rhodes our guest I've skipped this break so I can take some of the
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:08.960]  final calls and let's do it into some solutions they'll have a jam packed 30
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:13.520]  minutes on this issue after it but folks everything hinges on the guns if they
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:15.920]  can get away with this and they're already getting away with but you're in
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:19.160]  the rest of the Bill of Rights they're gonna take us into hot tyranny the
[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:25.320]  infrastructure is built they admit it okay they get those guns we are
[02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:29.880]  overrun and it's just gonna get worse and worse Alex in Kansas you're on the
[02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:35.160]  year go ahead pleasure to be with both of you gentlemen just a couple of
[02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:41.360]  questions with regards to Michael Harris who's a reporter for press I'm sorry
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:48.440]  for veterans today it's coming out and saying that you know this is a cover up
[02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:53.640]  for what would look like a Israel retaliation against the United States
[02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:58.320]  once his video went out sort of the interview international interview went
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:04.440]  out he's being backed by military members veterans today has has received
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:08.960]  overwhelming responses one three-star general quoted is saying Harris hit the
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:12.480]  nail on the head and just wondered if you heard is that the three-star general by
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:16.840]  name it does not and I've been looking let me just say something let me just
[02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:22.200]  say something that's a great sounding website and a great name I mean it's
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:26.240]  a world-class URL and I didn't really even follow it and seeing some interesting
[02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:30.640]  reports from like a month ago I'm like hey get those guys on there like this
[02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:35.400]  guy's saying you're an operative on here and I was like yeah so I mean things
[02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:38.880]  have been said about me on there that I know aren't true show look when you
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:43.040]  always hear and I'm not talking about his site but others or whoever I think
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:47.560]  it's a he runs it I don't have time to even keep track of all this stuff there's
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:52.040]  that EU site where it's like Russian general say or this or that says it's
[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:58.880]  always unnamed unnamed unnamed unnamed and I know it's fun to blame Israel for
[02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:02.440]  everything and I've come on air and said the Israeli lobby by and large is
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:05.400]  supporting gun control here which I think is out of control because our
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:10.760]  government helps arm Israelis with free m16s if they want them and m16s in the
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:17.800]  schools so I think it's effective to go to Schumer and Feinstein and Bloomberg
[02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:23.080]  and other you know Israeli operatives I mean they are Israeli operatives and
[02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:27.400]  say look you want our tax money so Israelis can have guns use that on them
[02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:31.840]  that's really effective so again there's this culture started where you can say
[02:23:31.840 --> 02:23:37.280]  Israelis you know blew up the moon and it must be true and if you say it isn't
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:41.040]  your pro-Israel I'm a big critic of some of the things Israel does but there's
[02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:44.880]  also a lot of stuff I think it's a tactic done by some where so much
[02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:48.600]  ridiculous stuff is said about Israel that then all the real stuff going on
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:53.760]  never gets looked at Stuart Rhodes well I'm not really authority on on those
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:59.280]  issues some of the past exactly it all becomes a diversion I mean it's like you
[02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:02.360]  know I'm fighting the Federal Reserve and I want to get rid of it people say
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:05.200]  how dare you cover up for the Jewish Federal Reserve and I'm like look
[02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:09.040]  whatever the Federal Reserve is let's just get rid of it shut up traitor you
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:12.720]  know let's not have war in Syria how dare you be a trader for Israel and I'm
[02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:17.400]  like no no I'm against war in Syria shut up traitor it look look Hal Turner was
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:22.280]  FBI I knew that it came out he was this is an important area to cover but see
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:25.880]  because it's only in certain quarters of the internet people think that that's
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:31.000]  really a discussion that even matters and the radio listeners they have no
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.480]  idea what we're even talking about go ahead I was gonna say that one thing I
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:39.720]  will say is the look you know there are plenty of Gentile white-angle Saxon
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:44.400]  Protestant oath-breaking traders in Congress and and then the banking
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:49.320]  system exactly no banking so I think it's ridiculous to say it's you know we
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:54.360]  have to focus on one race exactly it becomes a giant cop-out where where
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:58.840]  where no one involved in corruption can ever be confronted because well we all
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:02.880]  know the only evil in this world is you know a certain group which is a giant
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:08.000]  cop-out I'm sick of it it's just I'm and but as long as you're bashing Jews it's
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:11.760]  supposedly okay internet etiquette to make up anything you want about anybody
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:16.960]  you know I mean they say I'm Jewish and work for Israel I'm not but okay I'm
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:21.800]  Jewish okay we're gonna come put me on come shoot me in the head yeah I get
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:24.600]  the same thing actually I'm part of Mexicans they want to hit me for my race
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:30.640]  they can hate me for that I guess I'm not Jewish I'm part of Mexican and and
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:35.600]  Irish and Scottish and English but listen notice we're here talking about how
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:41.240]  executive orders to take our guns and I'm not bashing the caller it's just that
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:46.080]  the legitimate criticism of the of the Israel lobby a large part of it is that
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:50.160]  it's it's lobbying to get our guns so that it can politically control the
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:53.200]  United States so is the military industrial complex so are some of the
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:57.160]  other big lobbies let's get in these lobbies faces they're trying to take
[02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:01.880]  down the NRA is one of our most important lobbies well the NRA is helping
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:05.000]  them though look at the NRA's done recently nothing they did nothing on
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:08.480]  Friday and nothing over the weekend but they've said nothing in defense of the
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:12.920]  Bill of Rights you know that I think they're I don't know the paper Tigers
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:16.840]  now that's what gun owners of America has been forced to say he's tried to be
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:20.360]  classy about it but we're gonna have to continue with your story cuz I want to get
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:24.560]  to your solutions but we got diverted off into you know Israel did this is there
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:29.600]  anything Israel didn't do like if I fall in a banana pill tonight again I'm just
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:33.520]  sick of the mental illness of it you know just of just everything of the oh
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:36.960]  well this the Jews didn't that the Jews did it just become there I mean these
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:41.280]  people act like Jews are like on omnipresent you know Gandalf the wizard
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:45.720]  can do anything they want I mean it's just so annoying I'm sorry responsibility
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:51.800]  for the for your failure to guard your own Constitution you can't blame it on
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:56.400]  a foreign country and I understand their arguments about the influence of a foreign
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:00.680]  country and dual loyalties and all that and I agree it's a problem but they're
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:06.840]  long and we cover it and the anti-Israel crowd never recognizes and and they lie
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:11.960]  they they twist they make up things they edit things and then say it's proof and
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:17.280]  and so all I'm saying is Israel's got some big problems but the people attacking
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:23.480]  Israel are a bunch of liars it's I mean I've just never seen more deceptive scum
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:27.960]  that's my point let's go ahead and take another call and I'm not talking about
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:33.200]  even the guy with that other website I'm not generally let's talk to let's talk
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:38.360]  to mark on gun control history you're on the air mark hey man it's great to talk
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:43.640]  to George Washington and modern-day Israel Bizzle so and study a little bit
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:48.240]  about gun control and as you guys know it's not about guns it's about control so
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:52.440]  if you go back and study history you'll learn that in a 12th century Pope
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:57.800]  in a sense a second actually banned crossbows which was relatively new weapon
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:02.440]  which was able to pierce the armor of the soldiers and that obviously threatened
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:07.680]  the power monopoly of the state you can look at Japan in 1876 the Hattori edict
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:11.760]  they actually banned swords people who weren't in the military couldn't have
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:16.200]  swords in public or else they would be confiscated search it goes to show that
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:21.120]  whatever means of defense that people have against the tyranny the tyranny is
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:27.920]  gonna try to take absolutely and you've got all these snot-nosed idiots running
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:31.920]  around but we'll cover it after the break let me just read it now I appreciate
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:35.040]  your call great point we're gonna do a final segment a few minutes with
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:37.840]  Stuart plugging some solutions that I'm gonna get to some other special reports
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:45.000]  we need to hit and more phone calls but this is a ral vmk on a video I had
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:50.320]  posted about how they're coming for our guns and see now they're not denying
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:53.280]  they're coming for them they go yeah you bet we're coming for them the gun
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:56.920]  rights gang insists that it's not about guns it's about not letting crazy people
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:01.120]  have guns I agree and I'd like to propose that crazy should be defined to
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:05.600]  include anyone who fetishizes guns now we fetishize tit tyrants won't take us
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:09.720]  over we're obsessed with knowing the history of it stockpiles ammunition is
[02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:14.480]  obsessed with being disarmed black ewen helicopters in the coming apocalypse
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:18.080]  this guy is one of the first ones who should be disarmed talking about me
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:22.720]  before he blows a gasket and starts firing from a water tower somewhere like
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:28.200]  one of your prozac heads now again this is the standard deal they're now you
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:32.520]  bet you guys are see the collectivists want our money and they want our
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:36.640]  energy and it always ends with productive citizens in a forced labor camp
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:41.120]  with potbellied collectivist standing over us with machine guns they lay they
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:45.240]  are the ones that fetishize the guns they are my guns I got piles of my heart
[02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:48.240]  leaving that time to get them out I don't fetishize them I've been shooting them since

[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:39.800]  videos of parents of the children laughing and giggling and looking excited
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:44.040]  and then saying off-camera do I read off the card and then walking up and
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:49.640]  breaking down on camera on TV we need to and we need to have private
[02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:55.440]  investigators look into Sandy Hook okay Hitler blew up his own Capitol building
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:59.720]  to bring in martial law you're up Australian New Zealand banned most
[02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:04.480]  guns after staging mass shootings the evidence later came out this thing
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:11.400]  looks really really bad I'm getting more information on this and gonna look at
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:15.800]  playing that video before this hour ends and we have the other incredible video I
[02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:20.400]  can describe it for radio listeners female US cop caught on tape giving two
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:24.320]  women bob body cavity searches during routine traffic stop and using the same
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:30.680]  gloves on both well why not TSA does but this is in the pants in hey let's go in
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:35.440]  the back all right let's go in the front and the state police say this is their
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:40.600]  new policy they've been TSA trained and that they may they say be prepared and
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:44.880]  so the DPS director is being sued over this but they say we're gonna do it and
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:50.280]  that now routinely when you're pulled over they will give you a proctology
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:53.880]  exam basically they will not just go in your pants they will go in your body
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:57.600]  and if you don't like it you'll go to jail as a terrorist you resist you'll be
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:03.680]  killed so that's the new America I got a bunch more calls here and Stuart Rhodes
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:09.480]  by the way I've now got the text of Biden and Obama and they are going to
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:13.720]  create a task force working with governors and members of Congress and
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:17.760]  then it will be delivered in one month just when they get ready to bring the
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:22.400]  new session of Congress and to Obama and then he will take action and what is
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:26.600]  Reuters and Bloomberg saying it will be executive order so he'll say I talked to
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:31.200]  the Council of Governors which are little minions of FEMA and I've talked to
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:35.360]  the Rural Council which is minions of FEMA not not the real legislature is not
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:39.280]  the people plus the Constitution you'd have to amend it so this gives them
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:44.680]  dictatorial cover they always do this oh Hitler had a region of governors that
[02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:49.520]  would have signed off on what he did as well he had courts that would sign off
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:53.680]  so it's rubber stamps now I don't need Congress I have some governors I talked
[02:35:53.680 --> 02:36:00.600]  to and the word is from Reuters it will be that they can just put anybody on a
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:03.840]  no-gun buy list no judge no Jerry not even any mental background just you
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:11.280]  don't own guns from a manual promised and then expanding on that they will then
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:15.120]  ban the sale of semi-autos which you already see being done by the companies
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:19.480]  that Congress says is doing the right thing implying the guns are dirty they
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:25.360]  did it and so they're just creating a mass hoax and this new task force will
[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:30.880]  it's the new gun federal task force and it will work with locals to implement
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:35.920]  whatever the task force says and Obama will follow it so it's like I'm a
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:40.320]  dictator but I do what NATO says Congress you don't give me authority to
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:46.120]  attack NATO does well Obama I'm not a dictator but whatever the task force
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:49.920]  tells me I'll then use the dictatorial power of the presidency to do folks if
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:55.640]  you studied history this is incredible Stalin had a rubber stamp Duma that
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:03.600]  would certify Hitler had it the greatest mass murder in history mouse a tongue
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:08.480]  had one of these Cuba has one of these I mean wow they are really just going
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:13.160]  back to good old-fashioned rubber stamp Politburo's creating their known new
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:17.720]  task force and saying so the general dumb now public goes well the task force
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:24.280]  said I don't matter of Congress ain't for it the task force said the TSA says
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:28.840]  they train the Texas police they're allowed to stick their fingers in you
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:34.000]  now I mean they said so Stuart Rhodes you're a constitutional lawyer ain't
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:37.680]  that all right Stuart well the answer to this is
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:42.920]  nullification the answer is is in your local communities and your your
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:47.200]  towns or counties in your states you must nullify and states are already
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:52.120]  doing that we've seen nullification bills in Michigan Texas Virginia Arizona
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:55.800]  across the board against the NDA we're going to see them against this kind of
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:38:00.520]  this kind of nonsense also and so you hold your sheriff's feet to the fire you
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:04.600]  make sure he's a constitutional sheriff if he's not you route him out of office
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:08.800]  no matter what party he's in even if he's a good old board Republican he goes
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:12.200]  down the road and replace him as somebody who will obey his oh that's
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:16.640]  ground zero and he got somebody who will stand up for your rights and then you
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:20.320]  back him up with a posse and even better you back him up with a county
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:25.960]  militia and that is where your focus of resistance needs to be is in your local
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:30.840]  community in your state you must nullify and at the same time you must sweep out
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:36.400]  of office every oath breaker who's in office scorched earth policy they
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:40.480]  violate their oath they're gone you tell them I don't care the Democrat wins
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:44.760]  you're gone you violated your oath doesn't make a difference what part of
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:48.160]  your end this is the response that Madison and Jefferson urged on the
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:53.120]  American people back in 1798 in response to the alien submission act which are
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:57.200]  also a gross violation the Constitution they didn't go hat in hand the
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:00.760]  Supreme Court and asked the court to defend the Constitution they knew the
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:04.320]  presidency was already corrupt he had as administration they knew Congress was
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:07.920]  overrun with Federalist so what did they do they went to the legislature of the
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:13.000]  state and said you must nullify or we create a new party and purge the
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:17.040]  Federalist out of office and that's what they did they purge them out you must
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:22.000]  do the same thing a two-prong attack nullify or you that's right and
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:26.560]  everything legal and lawful but aggressive as possible yeah now we need to
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:32.200]  go and bullhorn congressman's houses we need to bullhorn their events we need
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:35.360]  to put private investigators on them because they're all committing crimes
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:40.560]  any gun grabber out there is a mafia trash and folks you get stuff loaded on
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:44.880]  YouTube just destroy them just just absolute war with these people I'm
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:49.320]  telling you folks I have fought the globalist any instantly you go put a
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:53.640]  camera on them they're committing crimes okay I mean I mean it's just oh paying
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:57.560]  people off in a hallway oh with a mistress I mean we need to get in the
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:02.600]  mafia's face and go listen dirtbags you you you pulled on the wrong Tigers tail
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:06.240]  you got that Mac this isn't some third world country you're gonna roll in and
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:09.200]  just kill everybody like you've done everywhere I know you think we're all a
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:14.840]  bunch of jellyfish we're not scum we see you we know what you are you're
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:20.880]  degenerate filth and it is time to get aggressive with them aggressive folks are
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:25.640]  they they have always hated America okay Stuart you talked about as a journalist
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:30.880]  researcher constitutional lawyer you know taught history at Yale somebody who's
[02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:34.280]  you know been there on the front lines of this you talk about the infrastructure
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:38.800]  for those that don't know this is a secret arrest mass takeover infrastructure
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:43.280]  and people go well that's scary I better not do anything no no no you better do
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:46.760]  something because it's such an evil infrastructure that's because they want
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:51.360]  to use it on us we just use the fact that they're so evil against them they
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:57.040]  can't get away with this historically if you attack a would-be authoritarian
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:01.080]  takeover before it fully launches it's kind of like how they have space-based
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:05.080]  weapons to use a military analogy that that that particle beam a rocket when
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:08.920]  it's on the ground this thing is fueled they're firing up they're getting ready
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:14.080]  to launch it we have got to maximum firepower politically blow that three
[02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:21.000]  stage rocket up on the launch pad but we've got to fire now Stuart absolutely
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.960]  and a big part of it is also is not waiting for the politicians to defend
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:30.280]  your rights or defend your the person but to take personal responsibility and
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:34.600]  then that means in your local communities going to your sheriff and saying we
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:39.920]  want you to deputize teachers we want you to deputize retired police officers
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:43.300]  put them in the schools we want you to train the teachers but even more
[02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:46.840]  basic than that you go do it that's why we put out a call out for our
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:51.240]  membership to step up and volunteer to teach teachers and school staff how to
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:55.960]  shoot how to defend themselves with knives with one object with pepper spray
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:59.640]  with guns whatever they need to and provide that training we're getting a
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:03.440]  great response for teachers across the country who want to be trained and so you
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:07.720]  step up in your local community and you solve the problem the problem that
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:14.240]  existed in the new town Connecticut school was a victim disarmament zone of
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:19.880]  no one being able to actually resist and fight back against arm intruder so you
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:24.400]  solve that problem in your community you are your teachers you are your veterans
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:28.440]  you are your your volunteers to go into the schools and be there to be the
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:31.840]  reaction force they're the first responders the police are second
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:36.560]  responders but time they get through the fights over almost always and so the
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:40.600]  teachers need to be armed and trained do it don't wait for someone to do it for
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:44.840]  you don't wait for politicians say it's okay you just go do it but I'll tell you
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.240]  the way I'll tell you the way to absolutely checkmate them because they
[02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:52.880]  act like you under federal law nobody can be armed at schools no you just go
[02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:56.800]  to your good sheriffs it'll be a huge news issue when they do it and I'll
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:00.480]  guarantee you you can come up with a school fund just like police are guarding
[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:05.080]  movie theaters for you know 15 bucks an hour you can guarantee get folks to
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:10.400]  volunteer but that's an auxiliary you can definitely get retired police you
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:14.400]  name it or other people or veterans whatever so they so we know they've you
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:17.080]  know got and they can even do what they want to their background all that stuff
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:24.560]  and then have them there as the auxiliary security force just like you have you
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:27.760]  know the old veteran helping the kids at the crosswalk and I like what Jesse
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:32.960]  Ventura says you just have them there in like a jump suit or whatever and you
[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:36.720]  know they can just be the I mean you could tell the kids or they could be
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:40.000]  just custodians that are there with a fanny pack you know with a handgun in
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:45.880]  it but again that's almost giving into the hysteria I mean you've had school
[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:52.360]  shootings on average maybe maybe 30 kids a year 88 total mass shootings most of
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:55.600]  them getting related one of these things only happens four or five you know
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:59.920]  every four or five years it really is a hoax I mean it's a real crisis for those
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:07.080]  20 dead kids but yeah again you've heard my analogy Stuart but the focus but it
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:12.120]  puts the focus on an actual solution to the problem they've created it created
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:16.960]  the problem by disarming people and so the solution is is to arm them and it's
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:20.960]  very easy like you just said it's very easy for retired cop who's already gone
[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:25.520]  through background checks already had training etc step up and say I volunteer
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:30.120]  and our members are willing to do that we're gonna have retired police officers
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:33.800]  and oathkeepers who are going to go by the way don't let them be involved in
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:37.880]  searching lockers and harassing people and you know pregnancy test or whatever
[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:43.120]  just there for the you know one in a million mass shooting that's it that
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:47.600]  they're there they're there as a last resort to defend the people against
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:53.240]  violence that's it but even better than that train the teachers train the
[02:44:53.240 --> 02:44:57.920]  teachers and the staff why is Israel you know having m16s and lockers in
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:01.160]  every classroom for you know the you know the one in a million when the
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:05.600]  Palestinians have gone in and killed kids I mean why I mean imagine if Israel
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:10.280]  said the answer is Israelis turn in all your guns everyone would laugh at that I
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:15.000]  think this is a key truth weapon against their lies to point out why does
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:22.280]  why does taxpayer money go to arm the Israelis in their schools but then that
[02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:27.160]  same federal government wants our guns to it yeah it's a it's a fair point
[02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:32.120]  hypocrisy and you know but still the big thing is a take back responsibility at
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:35.720]  the local level however you do it through the sheriff's department through
[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:39.720]  veterans through police officers are retired through the teachers whatever
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:44.360]  works in your community you've solved the problem there locally that's how you
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:50.200]  counter the the propaganda coming from DC that you must be disarmed you can say
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:54.720]  look we took care of it it's taken care of it done there's no no more shooting
[02:45:54.720 --> 02:45:58.120]  gonna happen here like that one school district in Texas it's been doing it
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:02.560]  since 2007 they've armed teachers no one knows whose arm they're all concealed
[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:06.360]  they don't know no one no and by the way the feds keep saying it's illegal it's
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:10.160]  lawful because it's going on and now Rick Perry I got to give Rick Perry credit
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:13.800]  he's been an evil globalist in the past but he may have changed his stripes he
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:18.280]  says arm all the teachers well here's the here's a pretty sad problem of a lot of
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:22.440]  conservatives the only part of the Constitution they still have a real
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:27.680]  devotion to is a second amendment and it's so brainwashed by the neocons that
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:30.720]  they've you know kind of forgotten all about the rest of it but I still care
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:34.720]  about that that's just the reality get a deal with it we try to get them back
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:38.960]  into the fold about caring about all the duller brights but hey let's take
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:44.080]  advantage of the situation in some ways to at least get them to be resolute
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:48.280]  about this and if we're going to have a fight let it come now over the second
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:54.200]  amendment to get over with Stuart talk about talk about any other solutions
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:58.280]  you've got well I think the most important thing I can say is is to reach
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:01.240]  out to the guys with a gun to know something about broken record but the
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:05.560]  Liberty movement really needs to focus on the guys with the guns especially the
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:10.120]  military that's the most critical population because you know we are at
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:13.800]  the crossroads where we're really going to have to fight another revolution
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:17.600]  or we have a very limited window of opportunity to roll things back piece
[02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:21.160]  with that purging out the old breakers and that's the other big thing you've
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:24.760]  got to get rid of this idea but you're going to support lesser two evils you
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:28.440]  got to stop doing that it's good it's like taking a reduced dose of poison over
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:33.000]  and over again you're still going to die so you guys stop doing that but to buy
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:38.080]  you more time focus on the guys with the guns that will cause strategic doubt in
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:42.880]  their minds of the elites about whether or not they can get away with trying to
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:46.720]  pull the plug finally you want to make them worry about it worry about whether
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:51.720]  they'll be resisted by their own ranks and that buys us more time to purge
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:56.680]  them out everybody who's in current political power is only this generation
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:48:01.040]  they're not permanent you can get rid of them you can purge them out if you're
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:05.560]  willing to have the moral courage to do it in politics it will take time though
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:10.120]  so to buy more time focus on the guys with the guns make sure they understand
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:14.360]  what's right and wrong so that you cause that that hesitancy in the power elites
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:19.080]  and buys you more time to get rid of them that's your only chance that and
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:22.080]  getting ready for the worst-case scenario which means you better be
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:26.480]  strengthened as your individual as a community your veterans should be woken
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:29.080]  up in your community they should be getting themselves prepared for the
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:33.720]  worst-case scenarios and nullify in your local communities and the state I want
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:38.880]  to get this message across to everybody right now authoritarian foreign banks
[02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:43.040]  have taken over they're running shy ops they probably even stage this event in
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:48.960]  Sandy Hook you better grow up folks I'm sorry the mainline neocon talk show
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:53.920]  host are gonna sell you down the river okay I'm risking my life so asturic to
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:58.840]  bring you this information because we realize what we're facing and the fact
[02:48:58.840 --> 02:49:01.480]  that we're still able to operate and expose these globalists is key we're
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:04.200]  going to break in two minutes during I'm gonna let you take us out to break and
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:06.600]  I'm gonna come back and play some video clips but I'm gonna let you have the
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:10.880]  floor in the last minute and a half you take us out to break Stuart well like
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:15.680]  you said before the main thing is is folks have got to stand up do not let
[02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:19.800]  them intimidate you not me don't let them con you and trick you into
[02:49:19.800 --> 02:49:24.360]  apologizing for the murder of children you have nothing to do with you have no
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:30.120]  no cause for apologizing in fact it's exact opposite it's a victim disarmament
[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:35.240]  freaks who insisted on leaving those children defenseless who owe everybody
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:40.320]  else an apology it is their psychosis and their fear of firearms that has made
[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:45.960]  them has driven them to create victim disarmament zones where it's like you
[02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:51.320]  know a bait for a coyote or a bait for wolves and it draws mass shooters but to
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:54.920]  put it back on them and their own personal responsibility and also make it
[02:49:54.920 --> 02:49:58.440]  very clear that you will not disarm decide right now that you will never
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:02.520]  disarm that you will pass on your firearms to your children and then you as
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:06.480]  an American have drawn that line in the sand you know at least be resolute about
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:10.640]  that and let's get past worrying about what Congress does let them know that
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:14.400]  no matter what they do you will not comply
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:22.360]  and and that's it and the other big one is is you've got to purge out the
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:26.760]  politicians if you let politicians continue to be reelected because you're
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:29.720]  afraid of the opposing party if your Republicans continue to vote for
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:35.640]  breaking traitors like John McCain or Lindsey Graham or Romney then you will
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:51:00.560]  compel us to fight
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:06.880]  hey there Frank Bates here have you heard about the weird device that could
[02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:12.600]  wipe out 280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:17.000]  warned that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known in
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:20.920]  fact just a few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an
[02:51:20.920 --> 02:51:24.400]  op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I
[02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:28.800]  can't believe that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the
[02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:32.760]  liberals in the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just
[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:37.960]  created a free video at weird device calm that exposes this threat and blows

[02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:18.120]  weight protein kind of work for a bit but it left me feeling bloated and my
[02:52:18.120 --> 02:52:21.560]  digestion seemed to slow down by some device struck a block I heard a

[02:59:57.400 --> 03:00:19.320]  Broadcasting Network all right this is a press conference with the anti gunners
[03:00:19.320 --> 03:00:26.080]  on CNN from days ago Huffington Post we just come to our attention Parker
[03:00:26.080 --> 03:00:29.960]  Robbie Parker recalls six-year-old daughter Newtown shooting victim Emily
[03:00:29.960 --> 03:00:34.280]  Parker and you know I could see being under you know a lot of stress and
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:36.960]  laughing and giggling well actually I couldn't if I just lost my daughter but
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:40.440]  whatever some people do that sometimes I smile if something is uncomfortable it's
[03:00:40.440 --> 03:00:47.480]  like yeah but what I don't get is do I read off the card so it shows some
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:51.520]  scripting there let's go to this video and audio fighting back tears and
[03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:54.600]  struggling to catch his breath that's not what I was really seeing the video at
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:00:58.720]  first that's after he gets up there a father of six-year-old gun down the
[03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:03.680]  school shooting in Connecticut told the World Saturday about a little girl who
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:09.160]  loved to draw was always smiling and he also reserved surprising words for
[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:14.160]  sympathy for the gunman so maybe he's just a really loving guy the issue is on
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:18.560]  9-11 there were all these clear actors and this whole actor thing goes too far
[03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:22.880]  people say everything's an actor now but on 9-11 all the fires you know cause it
[03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:26.000]  to fall symmetrically and into its own footprint and watch on every channel at
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:29.400]  the same time and they announced building 7 fell before it fell with a
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:34.800]  scripted deal on CNN and to BBC channels I mean you know it's when that
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:38.520]  happened but we need to investigate this because Rob do did a great report last
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:42.240]  night where there are all these news reports for no I saw another guy in
[03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:46.480]  camo with a bag a guy with a mask they put him in the police car they won't say
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:50.480]  who he was they won't talk about it all these clips of witnesses singing and
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:54.200]  people inside saying to gunman it's one thing to get confused it's another thing
[03:01:54.200 --> 03:01:57.200]  entirely well let's just go to this video and I'll be describing it for
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:00.600]  audio listeners on radio here it is
[03:02:00.600 --> 03:02:04.400]  he's going to come back to the microphones now and make a statement
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:08.800]  looks like the family is there and they're getting ready to make to come to
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:14.280]  the microphone so we'll listen to that okay
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:23.600]  unbelievable back that up please I mean the guy looks like he and he does look
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:31.160]  like a soap opera actor handsome guy he has a very suave walk but I mean you know
[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:34.160]  perhaps that's how you handle it when you're really nervous but that is a
[03:02:34.160 --> 03:02:39.160]  smile of absolute satisfaction and these other people and this is weird
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:43.160]  he's going to come back to the microphones now and make a statement
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:47.560]  looks like the family is there and they're getting ready to make to come to
[03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:55.360]  microphone so listen so he's really smiling and looks happy and all of a
[03:02:55.360 --> 03:03:02.880]  sudden suddenly it looks totally fake I mean this he'd be maybe a good looking
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:10.360]  guy but he's not a good actor I mean what the let me tell you something my
[03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:14.440]  four-year-old and I've got a little sweetie pie about like this poor little
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:17.360]  girl I don't know what's up man I don't know what planet I'm living on at this
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:22.480]  point this video is unbelievable we're just going to post the video and let you
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:26.600]  decide what you think he needs to I mean maybe he should explain it to us we need
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:29.920]  to analyze all these videos now heaven help us ladies and gentlemen heaven
[03:03:29.920 --> 03:03:34.120]  help us I've never seen anything like that
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:43.120]  because he exudes maybe they put him on pills or something that's all they could
[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:46.240]  could describe this you know after you lose your daughter they put you on some
[03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:50.000]  antipressants or something but I thought those take a month to kick in I mean
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:53.400]  it's like a look of absolute satisfaction like he's about to accept an
[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:59.320]  Oscar and he's smiling and just oh this is mmm
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:05.200]  all sudden it just looks totally good let me ask you guys does that look fake
[03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:13.120]  to you or yeah totally fake John Bell you want to talk on there we never do
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:18.320]  this and all of your punch top yeah that's an actor he is reacting to what
[03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:21.960]  he's supposed to do that's what an actor does so it's his daughter he probably
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:26.560]  really is sad I think that probably explains it but because there's another
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:29.920]  tape I was saying I mean is that the same clip I saw Reese says do I read the
[03:04:29.920 --> 03:04:33.560]  card or is that what he says there's bad audio it's hard to make out off camera
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:39.640]  somebody says yes you do he says do I read the card yes you do okay then he
[03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:45.680]  goes into his act that's what it looks like now if that was my daughter I my
