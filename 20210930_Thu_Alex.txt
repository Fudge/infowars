[00:00.000 --> 00:15.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Alex Jones show live on this Thursday, September 30th,
[00:15.600 --> 00:16.600]  2021.
[00:16.600 --> 00:20.880]  I'm Owen Troyer sitting in for Alex today in the Info Wars World headquarters in Austin,
[00:20.880 --> 00:21.880]  Texas.
[00:21.880 --> 00:25.600]  We will be hearing from Alex coming up in the next segment and then later at the bottom
[00:25.600 --> 00:30.440]  of the hour as well.
[00:30.440 --> 00:37.800]  The big story today has to be the next level of government overreach when it comes to COVID
[00:37.800 --> 00:48.600]  and I actually had this reported to me last night after an individual who called into the
[00:48.600 --> 00:54.200]  war room, called in the war room, talked about how the hospital wouldn't let her in to visit
[00:54.200 --> 00:57.280]  her boyfriend because she wasn't vaccinated.
[00:57.280 --> 01:02.760]  And then when she finally got in via a back door, they then kicked her out aggressively.
[01:02.760 --> 01:06.960]  She said after she hung up the phone of telling that story on air, she got a call from the
[01:06.960 --> 01:11.440]  CDC saying, why aren't you vaccinate?
[01:11.440 --> 01:17.360]  So I was already going to cover that today when I'm talking to Alex this morning and
[01:17.360 --> 01:19.960]  he's sending me more information about this.
[01:19.960 --> 01:28.320]  And now we have stories up at infowars.com where people are getting automated calls and
[01:28.320 --> 01:34.920]  messages from the CDC and then sometimes there's actually a person on the other side of the
[01:34.920 --> 01:35.920]  line.
[01:35.920 --> 01:38.240]  And they're asking, how did you get my number?
[01:38.240 --> 01:39.800]  Am I in a database?
[01:39.800 --> 01:45.080]  And they say, oh yes, well we know that you're not vaccinated and so we do have your number
[01:45.080 --> 01:47.360]  and we're reaching out to the unvaccinated.
[01:47.360 --> 01:53.520]  So you're already on a database for the COVID vaccine.
[01:53.520 --> 02:00.600]  No warning, no law sign, no bill sign, nothing like that.
[02:00.600 --> 02:06.680]  Just oh, you haven't been vaccinated and so you're on a list.
[02:06.680 --> 02:13.680]  It's just yet another level of the political persecution where you have conservatives like
[02:13.680 --> 02:22.280]  Nick Fuentes and others who are on no fly lists or on terror watch lists.
[02:22.280 --> 02:26.840]  That's right.
[02:26.840 --> 02:33.880]  And now you may get a call, you in this audience, the unvaccinated, which is not even the right
[02:33.880 --> 02:34.880]  word for it.
[02:34.880 --> 02:37.040]  You're just not vaccinated or you don't have a COVID vaccine.
[02:37.040 --> 02:44.280]  I mean, unvaccinated would insinuate you've already had it, but that's just semantics.
[02:44.280 --> 02:49.120]  You, the person that doesn't want to comply with medical tyranny, you, the person that
[02:49.120 --> 02:55.280]  doesn't want to live your life in fear, you, the non-COVID-vaxxed individual, you're now
[02:55.280 --> 03:00.320]  on a government watch list and you might be getting a call from the CDC.
[03:00.320 --> 03:02.000]  How loving is that?
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.480]  They just love spying on you and now they want a new way of spying on you, by the way.
[03:06.480 --> 03:12.440]  There's a story out today about geotrackable and traceable firearms.
[03:12.440 --> 03:15.440]  Oh, I see, I see.
[03:15.440 --> 03:19.160]  That way you can, it's going to be like your car or like your phone and it's just always
[03:19.160 --> 03:22.920]  on the grid now, the internet of things.
[03:22.920 --> 03:30.440]  And by the way, if you say something that's true about COVID or about the vaccines, YouTube's
[03:30.440 --> 03:32.520]  going to ban you.
[03:32.520 --> 03:36.200]  They made that policy and, and thousands, perhaps millions.
[03:36.200 --> 03:42.080]  I mean, I know of multiple conservative commentators and hosts that had a YouTube channel that
[03:42.080 --> 03:47.000]  already got a strike, two strikes just overnight, not even on a new video they did.
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.080]  Just, oh, you said this about COVID, we're hitting you with a strike.
[03:52.080 --> 03:53.160]  So they're really going for it.
[03:53.160 --> 04:01.680]  And then the CEO, Susan Wojiecki, she comes out and she says, we are pro free speech at
[04:01.680 --> 04:02.680]  YouTube.
[04:02.680 --> 04:07.960]  Oh, you're just censoring everybody you don't like, but you're pro free speech, right, right,
[04:07.960 --> 04:08.960]  right.
[04:08.960 --> 04:09.960]  Okay.
[04:09.960 --> 04:13.000]  So we'll have more of the COVID tyranny.
[04:13.000 --> 04:19.560]  And then I'll tell you, there's things happening in the White House right now that aren't getting
[04:19.560 --> 04:27.360]  much coverage either they're getting ready for Kamala Harris to take over or, or she realizes
[04:27.360 --> 04:30.040]  that she's the most unpopular vice president ever.
[04:30.040 --> 04:32.800]  And so she's doing some things behind the scenes that would tell you that.
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.240]  And then Biden, hey, you know that there was a congressional baseball game happened last
[04:36.240 --> 04:38.760]  night.
[04:38.760 --> 04:43.560]  Let's not forget when the Democrat tried to commit mass murder, James Hodgkinson.
[04:43.560 --> 04:46.680]  Remember when he tried to commit mass murder and have a mass shooting at the Republican
[04:46.680 --> 04:48.320]  baseball practice and the media ignored it?
[04:48.320 --> 04:49.320]  Well, because he's a Democrat.
[04:49.320 --> 04:53.240]  Well, they had a congressional baseball game last night, Biden showed up.
[04:53.240 --> 04:55.680]  And how do you think he was received?
[04:55.680 --> 04:56.680]  We'll have more on that.
[04:56.680 --> 05:03.680]  And now it's Jones on the other side.
[05:56.680 --> 06:15.160]  The
[06:15.160 --> 06:25.120]  most banned network in the world.
[06:25.120 --> 06:46.840]  It is Thursday, September 30th, 2021.
[06:46.840 --> 06:50.200]  And I come to you with very grave news.
[06:50.200 --> 06:56.040]  We have documented the public admissions of the UN and every other major Western government
[06:56.040 --> 07:02.040]  under it to establish what they call the shielding process.
[07:02.040 --> 07:07.480]  And that is where even the CDC's own documents, they will take the mass of the population,
[07:07.480 --> 07:12.520]  the majority of the population that they claim do not have COVID and put them in giant government
[07:12.520 --> 07:18.920]  facilities, sports stadiums, military bases, but also locked down each neighborhood, putting
[07:18.920 --> 07:22.880]  leftist contact tracers through the Clinton Global Initiative and Google, that's who
[07:22.880 --> 07:25.200]  runs it, as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[07:25.200 --> 07:29.400]  They've all gotten big contracts from the government here in the U.S. to oversee the
[07:29.400 --> 07:34.160]  neighborhood and basically set up their own Maoist style communist takeover.
[07:34.160 --> 07:41.960]  COVID-19 is the cover for a worldwide corporate fascist takeover using communism as the operating
[07:41.960 --> 07:43.520]  system on the ground.
[07:43.520 --> 07:49.600]  Now, over a year ago, the CDC put out its report on shielding, we'll put that on screen.
[07:49.600 --> 07:53.480]  It's the exact same program of the UN, exact same program of Australia, same program of
[07:53.480 --> 07:54.960]  the U.K. and Canada.
[07:54.960 --> 08:01.920]  They've now built emergency cities that hold between five and 30,000 people as propaganda
[08:01.920 --> 08:05.440]  pieces to show how wonderful it is and how nice it is and how they're separate areas
[08:05.440 --> 08:06.760]  for the men, women and children.
[08:06.760 --> 08:12.040]  But on the larger plan, they're literally just going to put you in barbed wire enclosures.
[08:12.040 --> 08:15.480]  This is, again, the cover for martial law.
[08:15.480 --> 08:19.200]  And the plan is they know the awake people won't take the deadly shot.
[08:19.200 --> 08:24.080]  And so that allows them to get the majority vaccinated and then turn against and persecute
[08:24.080 --> 08:28.440]  those who've not taken the injection, which they're now openly doing, saying this is a
[08:28.440 --> 08:30.880]  epidemic, a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[08:30.880 --> 08:37.040]  Well, I said 20 months ago, when the inoculations make people sick, they will then turn around
[08:37.040 --> 08:39.520]  and say the unvaccinated are making everybody sick.
[08:39.520 --> 08:43.880]  And the evidence is it's really the shedding, as top scientists told us, from these injections
[08:43.880 --> 08:49.000]  that are not classic vaccines, but are systems that reprogram your body to create the spike
[08:49.000 --> 08:50.000]  protein.
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.880]  So now, in just the last 10 hours or 15 hours or so since I was working late last night,
[08:55.880 --> 08:56.880]  it's all broken.
[08:56.880 --> 08:57.880]  Okay.
[08:57.880 --> 09:06.600]  In Australia, in the U.S. everywhere, they are now putting out CDC letters to our thousands
[09:06.600 --> 09:13.240]  of managers per state as contact tracers to then go and oversee people at the, quote,
[09:13.240 --> 09:14.880]  shielded facilities.
[09:14.880 --> 09:18.720]  So they are using the term the shield process.
[09:18.720 --> 09:22.440]  And again, this is where they, quote, take the healthy people and say you're locked up
[09:22.440 --> 09:25.840]  because the unvaccinated are dangerous making you sick.
[09:25.840 --> 09:30.720]  They will then buy into the Stockholm syndrome and be reprogrammed at these facilities to
[09:30.720 --> 09:36.400]  literally be a political army that then marches against the uninjected.
[09:36.400 --> 09:38.440]  The magnitude of this evil is incredible.
[09:38.440 --> 09:42.440]  And again, by this winter, the top scientists have reported that the autoimmune response
[09:42.440 --> 09:48.200]  of people that are already producing the spike protein, when they run into normal coronaviruses,
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.960]  it's going to cause a huge cytokine storm and a huge autoimmune response and super
[09:52.960 --> 09:54.760]  bad illnesses and death.
[09:54.760 --> 09:57.280]  They're going to say that's caused by the unvaccinated.
[09:57.280 --> 10:00.480]  So I kept asking the last two years or 20 months, how are they going to get everybody
[10:00.480 --> 10:07.080]  sick with these shots and the cover that it's not the shots that did it, and we said they'll
[10:07.080 --> 10:09.720]  say it's the unvaccinated.
[10:09.720 --> 10:11.360]  So this is how you take over society.
[10:11.360 --> 10:13.000]  It's how you shut down all the small businesses.
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.640]  It's how Walmart and Amazon, everybody are able to take over because everybody else is
[10:17.640 --> 10:18.800]  going to be being shut down.
[10:18.800 --> 10:23.360]  They're going to force everybody to take weekly and then daily PCR tests at all the trucking
[10:23.360 --> 10:27.720]  companies, all the major distributor warehouses, this is all in the plans.
[10:27.720 --> 10:29.600]  Those that won't will be fired.
[10:29.600 --> 10:31.640]  That will then break down society further.
[10:31.640 --> 10:32.640]  So this is it.
[10:32.640 --> 10:34.800]  This is the big takeover.
[10:34.800 --> 10:37.920]  Everything you see in Australia as I've warned you is now coming here.
[10:37.920 --> 10:40.280]  Biden said his patience is wearing thin.
[10:40.280 --> 10:41.360]  That's all a script.
[10:41.360 --> 10:42.840]  And notice he's saying build back better.
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.040]  That is the public PR term of the great reset and cause swap.
[10:47.040 --> 10:50.600]  Build back better means collapse industrial society, get rid of the middle class.
[10:50.600 --> 10:54.400]  That's why the UN, when we were there a few months ago, has huge signs up saying you'll
[10:54.400 --> 10:59.440]  no longer live in the city, you'll live in communes, and it shows concrete little concentration
[10:59.440 --> 11:02.560]  camp bunkers like something out of 1984.
[11:02.560 --> 11:04.520]  That's because that's their plan.
[11:04.520 --> 11:09.280]  So again, it's cloured and pivot on steroids, bankrupt the economy, bring everything down.
[11:09.280 --> 11:10.920]  So I was already covering this last night.
[11:10.920 --> 11:14.640]  I was already preparing articles with Paul Joseph Watson today for infowars.com that
[11:14.640 --> 11:16.400]  are now up.
[11:16.400 --> 11:22.880]  Then this morning on Facebook, posters start saying I'm getting called by the CDC national
[11:22.880 --> 11:26.120]  vaccine survey.
[11:26.120 --> 11:27.720]  They showed screenshots.
[11:27.720 --> 11:28.720]  We called the number.
[11:28.720 --> 11:29.720]  They checked it out.
[11:29.720 --> 11:30.720]  It's a real place in Chicago.
[11:30.720 --> 11:35.120]  They've got them all over the country that are now calling the quote unvaccinated and
[11:35.120 --> 11:40.800]  basically bullying them and threatening them and saying, well, you need to get your shot.
[11:40.800 --> 11:44.960]  Total violation of the Nuremberg Code, total violation of HIPAA, total violation of your
[11:44.960 --> 11:45.960]  privacy.
[11:45.960 --> 11:49.640]  But this is a revolution against your privacy, a revolution against your rights.
[11:49.640 --> 11:53.720]  Major ethics professor came out yesterday of a major university and said this is all
[11:53.720 --> 11:54.720]  evil.
[11:54.720 --> 11:55.720]  YouTube took him down.
[11:55.720 --> 11:58.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're going to make their move here.
[11:58.720 --> 11:59.720]  They're making their move here.
[11:59.720 --> 12:04.480]  And that's why they want to get the majority of people injected so that they can then organize
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.240]  them as the good people against those of us that don't take the shots as the bad people.
[12:09.240 --> 12:11.200]  They've tried to use race to divide us.
[12:11.200 --> 12:13.440]  They've tried to use economics to divide us.
[12:13.440 --> 12:15.800]  Now they're going to use the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated.
[12:15.800 --> 12:20.680]  Again, telling the vaccinated, you're sick because of the unvaccinated and you can't
[12:20.680 --> 12:23.520]  go back to normal because of them.
[12:23.520 --> 12:25.120]  We're trying to get you back to normal.
[12:25.120 --> 12:26.520]  Now we're about a year behind Australia.
[12:26.520 --> 12:28.120]  Australia was saying that a year ago.
[12:28.120 --> 12:31.000]  Now Australia says, sorry, you all took the shot.
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.000]  It never goes away.
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.840]  You get shots every few months.
[12:33.840 --> 12:38.440]  So again, the poor fools that have Stockholm syndrome, this is so scary.
[12:38.440 --> 12:40.120]  They can't handle it.
[12:40.120 --> 12:42.160]  Don't know how to deal with the fact they're being abused and attacked.
[12:42.160 --> 12:46.120]  They have learned helplessness and their normalcy bias is basically put them in a position
[12:46.120 --> 12:49.240]  to believe everything goes back to the way it was if they just submit.
[12:49.240 --> 12:53.920]  No, this is a war-gamed scientific takeover on every front.
[12:53.920 --> 12:57.840]  So I want to call for you, and I'm going to record this from one phone to another, off
[12:57.840 --> 12:58.840]  the speakerphone.
[12:58.840 --> 12:59.840]  I called about 10 minutes ago.
[12:59.840 --> 13:01.120]  They didn't answer.
[13:01.120 --> 13:04.080]  They may answer now, but they obviously should be opening up.
[13:04.080 --> 13:07.840]  And I'm also going to have Owen on the show today call this number so you can hear this
[13:07.840 --> 13:08.840]  for yourself.
[13:08.840 --> 13:09.840]  We got all the screenshots.
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.840]  It's in Paul Joseph Watson's report again on infowars.com, but this is the rollout.
[13:15.840 --> 13:16.840]  This is the preparation.
[13:16.840 --> 13:20.920]  And then they're going to go out with contact tracers and say, oh, we can't let you spread
[13:20.920 --> 13:21.920]  COVID-19.
[13:21.920 --> 13:23.920]  We're going to release more deadly variants show that's coming.
[13:23.920 --> 13:27.280]  And then now we've got to arrest those that won't take the shots, and we've got to put
[13:27.280 --> 13:32.120]  people in camps to, quote, protect them, quote, take your children to make sure they're safe
[13:32.120 --> 13:33.920]  because they care about the children so much.
[13:33.920 --> 13:35.280]  This is a real nightmare.
[13:35.280 --> 13:36.280]  This is happening now.
[13:36.280 --> 13:37.280]  Go ahead and call them.
[13:37.280 --> 13:38.280]  This is Chicago, Illinois.
[13:38.280 --> 13:39.280]  Turn it up all the way.
[13:39.280 --> 13:40.280]  No answer in a moment.
[13:40.280 --> 13:52.960]  You have reached the National Immunization Survey conducted by NLRC at the University
[13:52.960 --> 13:55.960]  of Chicago on behalf of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
[13:55.960 --> 13:57.960]  They're unable to answer your call at this time.
[13:57.960 --> 14:02.960]  Please leave your full name, phone number, and a brief message, and you will return and
[14:02.960 --> 14:03.960]  call as soon as possible.
[14:03.960 --> 14:04.960]  Thank you.
[14:04.960 --> 14:05.960]  And have a good day.
[14:05.960 --> 14:06.960]  I'll leave a message.
[14:06.960 --> 14:13.200]  Here's my message.
[14:13.200 --> 14:17.240]  This is Alex Jones, broadcasting worldwide.
[14:17.240 --> 14:21.520]  And we are aware of the fact that you're just contractors that are engaged in this activity.
[14:21.520 --> 14:27.040]  It doesn't matter if you say it's a CDC contract or if you just say that it's a national survey.
[14:27.040 --> 14:30.240]  There are reports coming in that you're calling people at their homes and saying, we have evidence
[14:30.240 --> 14:31.240]  you're not vaccinated.
[14:31.240 --> 14:34.520]  When they ask, how do you know, oh, we have a national database?
[14:34.520 --> 14:40.440]  That national database is illegal, it violates HIPAA, and the federal government isn't allowed
[14:40.440 --> 14:46.360]  to then give contractors people's phone number, their information, and their medical history.
[14:46.360 --> 14:50.920]  This is all part of a global government system to set up a world medical ID system that'll
[14:50.920 --> 14:55.640]  be used as the world cash flow society system to implement carbon taxes.
[14:55.640 --> 15:01.000]  So again, you're being put on record right now that in my extremely educated opinion,
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.160]  what you're all doing is illegal, and you're being put on notice right now that what you're
[15:06.160 --> 15:11.920]  doing is to condition the public and bully the public using these databases, and that
[15:11.920 --> 15:13.440]  you need to cease and desist.
[15:13.440 --> 15:15.960]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[15:15.960 --> 15:24.200]  Okay, so there is the voicemail that I just left for them, and again, I'm going to be
[15:24.200 --> 15:27.000]  back on air later today, breaking all this down, I'm going to be on Stephen Crowder's
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  show.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.600]  But the thing you need to understand is this is extremely serious, and that the globalists
[15:32.600 --> 15:34.520]  are taking over the country and taking over the world.
[15:34.520 --> 15:38.640]  This is a worldwide UN-directed program, and this is it.
[15:38.640 --> 15:41.560]  We must get the governors, the legislators, and others to wake up and understand that
[15:41.560 --> 15:43.000]  this is a takeover plan.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.080]  The more we give in, the worse the crisis gets.
[15:45.080 --> 15:50.240]  The contact tracers are coming, the new lockdowns are coming, the persecution of the un-injected
[15:50.240 --> 15:57.520]  is coming back to Owen Schroder and my broadcast.
[15:57.520 --> 16:01.360]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[16:01.360 --> 16:06.040]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:06.040 --> 16:07.040]  Here's why.
[16:07.040 --> 16:11.040]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:11.040 --> 16:16.040]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:16.040 --> 16:21.200]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[16:21.200 --> 16:25.120]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:25.120 --> 16:29.080]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[16:29.080 --> 16:33.800]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:33.800 --> 16:39.120]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[16:39.120 --> 16:40.120]  too.

[16:56.320 --> 16:57.920]  Hey everybody.
[16:57.920 --> 17:02.840]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great
[17:02.840 --> 17:03.840]  news.
[17:03.840 --> 17:05.960]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:05.960 --> 17:06.960]  Here's the thing.
[17:06.960 --> 17:12.480]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[17:12.480 --> 17:17.760]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:17.760 --> 17:20.560]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:20.560 --> 17:26.000]  The best part, we've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.080]  food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[17:31.080 --> 17:32.080]  Gets even better.
[17:32.080 --> 17:36.760]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want
[17:36.760 --> 17:42.000]  to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the
[17:42.000 --> 17:43.000]  world, period.

[17:49.440 --> 17:58.440]  this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[17:58.440 --> 18:00.200]  I got some good news.

[18:06.360 --> 18:09.720]  The bad news is, a lot of them are about to sell out.

[18:28.960 --> 18:31.440]  out is back in stock, 50% off.
[18:31.440 --> 18:36.200]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12, 50% off, and also on Deep Earth
[18:36.200 --> 18:38.520]  Crystal iodine, Survival Shull X2.

[18:55.600 --> 18:58.440]  Again, all that we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[18:58.440 --> 19:02.880]  By now, you've heard me talk about the BioProse and how they're creating amazing products.
[19:02.880 --> 19:08.480]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio-remediation products
[19:08.480 --> 19:11.840]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer.
[19:11.840 --> 19:15.960]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[19:15.960 --> 19:21.640]  The BioProse are excited to release Biodrain Pro, a product specifically designed to establish
[19:21.640 --> 19:25.360]  healthy drains, pipes, and overall plumbing systems.
[19:25.360 --> 19:31.280]  Biodrain Pro digests grease, fats, oils, sludge, paper, and organic matter with ease.
[19:31.280 --> 19:37.760]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs, and is safe for black-gray holding tanks, sewer hoses,
[19:37.760 --> 19:38.760]  and plumbing.
[19:38.760 --> 19:43.640]  If you're also human and animal safe, get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy
[19:43.640 --> 19:44.640]  applications.
[19:44.640 --> 19:50.240]  Say goodbye to drain problems, gas build-up and odor, guaranteed.
[19:50.240 --> 19:51.560]  Just pour and add water.
[19:51.560 --> 19:52.560]  It's that simple.
[19:52.560 --> 20:17.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:17.560 --> 20:29.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, my head is spinning with all the news that's developing
[20:29.320 --> 20:38.560]  right now, but it's all par for the course as we are being goose-stepped and brainwashed
[20:38.560 --> 20:46.400]  into global government medical tyranny under the guise of fighting a virus known as COVID-19,
[20:46.400 --> 20:50.640]  which is now pretty much publicly accepted as being created in the Wuhan lab by Anthony
[20:50.640 --> 20:55.440]  Fauci and Peter Dossick with the Chinese military, but we just don't like to talk about that
[20:55.440 --> 20:58.520]  or admit that that's the real deal, because then that would cause us to have to take action
[20:58.520 --> 21:01.800]  against Fauci and Dossick, and we don't want to do that because they've been lifted up
[21:01.800 --> 21:06.160]  as heroes by the mainstream media, and we don't want to do that because then the mainstream
[21:06.160 --> 21:09.320]  media would be completely discredited and all the lies that they've been telling us
[21:09.320 --> 21:11.160]  for years would completely fall apart.
[21:11.160 --> 21:17.320]  So we can't start that train or series of events if you will.
[21:17.320 --> 21:24.720]  So we are going to call, I think I'm going to do it in the next segment, we'll call
[21:24.720 --> 21:35.880]  the CDC hotline because they now are, without announcing it, announcing it just by telling
[21:35.880 --> 21:36.880]  you that it's happening.
[21:36.880 --> 21:39.360]  They never said it was going to happen, there was never a debate, there was never a law
[21:39.360 --> 21:48.960]  sign, no, the CDC just now has the vaccine database built so it knows that you haven't
[21:48.960 --> 21:56.480]  been vaccinated and you may be getting a call and you may be getting a text from your loving
[21:56.480 --> 22:02.440]  tyrants at the CDC just asking you why you haven't been vaccinated, what's wrong with
[22:02.440 --> 22:03.440]  you?
[22:03.440 --> 22:07.400]  Do you want to be fined, do you want to be arrested, do you want to be put in a quarantine
[22:07.400 --> 22:16.640]  camp because you better get that vaccine if not, oh, that's not scary at all.
[22:16.640 --> 22:21.200]  And I have to say though, and I'll just get started into the stack of news, I thought
[22:21.200 --> 22:28.640]  that this was a joke when I first saw it, I guess maybe it was last night, Pfizer-Mectin,
[22:28.640 --> 22:36.360]  Pfizer-Mectin, again, I thought it was a joke and they were just making fun of the fact
[22:36.360 --> 22:41.480]  that ivermectin works and Pfizer's pissed that it works because it's more effective
[22:41.480 --> 22:46.000]  than the vaccine at stopping the spread of COVID or healing you from COVID.
[22:46.000 --> 22:51.680]  Well no, it was actually real, it's not called Pfizer-Mectin but Pfizer enters late stage
[22:51.680 --> 23:01.720]  study for oral COVID-19 antiviral drug and ladies and gentlemen, it's pretty much the
[23:01.720 --> 23:04.360]  same thing as ivermectin.
[23:04.360 --> 23:07.720]  It's just Pfizer's brand.
[23:07.720 --> 23:15.520]  And so Pfizer's new drug is from the zero hedge article, a quote on it, Pfizer's new
[23:15.520 --> 23:21.120]  drug which some have jokingly dubbed Pfizer-Mectin is described by the pharmaceutical giant as
[23:21.120 --> 23:27.240]  a potent protease inhibitor, that's exactly what ivermectin, the prophylactic used for
[23:27.240 --> 23:30.920]  a number of reasons in both humans and animals does.
[23:30.920 --> 23:40.720]  So the scoundrels, the crooks over at Pfizer, I mean, look, I'm not the type of person that
[23:40.720 --> 23:46.200]  would like to put blood money into my bank account but, and I'm not giving financial
[23:46.200 --> 23:51.120]  advice here but boy oh boy, a Pfizer stock probably looks pretty good right now, they
[23:51.120 --> 23:53.400]  just get to own the entire market.
[23:53.400 --> 24:00.360]  So Pfizer and the vaccine manufacturers, big pharma, don't want you to know about ivermectin
[24:00.360 --> 24:06.080]  because then they can't get billion-dollar contracts and sell billions of vaccines if
[24:06.080 --> 24:09.120]  ivermectin is effective treatment, which it is.
[24:09.120 --> 24:16.360]  So the media that they own on the internet and on television comes out against ivermectin
[24:16.360 --> 24:24.840]  because it hurts their bottom line at Pfizer, well, what do you do when you can't completely
[24:24.840 --> 24:32.720]  scuttle that news from getting out that ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID and in
[24:32.720 --> 24:40.120]  India where it's been implemented in massive cities, it's pretty much been 100% effective.
[24:40.120 --> 24:42.340]  Eliminating COVID is an issue.
[24:42.340 --> 24:45.880]  So what do you do if you're Pfizer and this is hurting your bottom line, well, you just
[24:45.880 --> 24:49.920]  make the exact same product of ivermectin and rebrand it as your own and say, okay,
[24:49.920 --> 24:51.920]  this is good for COVID.
[24:51.920 --> 25:00.240]  Same thing, different brand, one's okay for COVID, the other's hoarse to warmer.
[25:00.240 --> 25:05.360]  This is truly astounding and this is just the evil of big pharma.
[25:05.360 --> 25:10.880]  This is just the evil of the media that's owned by big pharma.
[25:10.880 --> 25:16.160]  And yet another example, first it was COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines bad for pregnant women.
[25:16.160 --> 25:18.760]  Now they're just urging you to get it.
[25:18.760 --> 25:26.320]  Just alert, pregnant women need the vaccine and even though they admit that the vaccine
[25:26.320 --> 25:33.160]  gives you more of a viral load and so they say, oh, COVID itself has such a bad effect
[25:33.160 --> 25:39.240]  on pregnant women, therefore you need to get the vaccine that gives you more COVID.
[25:39.240 --> 25:47.720]  All propaganda, all so that you buy big pharmaceuticals product and make them filthy rich and of course
[25:47.720 --> 25:51.920]  the establishment of global government just comes side by side with this.
[25:51.920 --> 25:56.120]  They can make you fear your life over a virus and give over all of your freedoms in the
[25:56.120 --> 25:58.120]  name of fear of that fear.
[25:58.120 --> 26:09.120]  Well then they've got you in a prison already and that of course is the goal here.
[26:09.120 --> 26:13.320]  And you're starting to see people reporting that they're getting calls and automated
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.960]  messages from the CDC saying you're not vaccinated, what's wrong with you?
[26:18.960 --> 26:23.880]  Come to one of these facilities, get your vaccine, you dirty rotten American, we will
[26:23.880 --> 26:30.320]  force vaccinate you if not, I have people sending me emails, messages, showing me these
[26:30.320 --> 26:34.200]  messages, they're sending me emails that they're getting from their private companies basically
[26:34.200 --> 26:39.520]  saying get the vaccine or you're fired and that's all thanks to the Biden administration
[26:39.520 --> 26:44.360]  and they say it in these emails too that it's the Biden administration doing this.
[26:44.360 --> 26:48.440]  So they blame the Biden administration but it's a policy that they're enacting, hey you
[26:48.440 --> 26:53.800]  don't have to follow tyrannical orders, you don't have to follow illegal orders, you can
[26:53.800 --> 26:59.200]  fight back against this illegal vaccine mandate on so many different fronts so you giving
[26:59.200 --> 27:03.600]  into it but then passing the blame on Biden but that's the perfect excuse, that's the
[27:03.600 --> 27:11.160]  perfect getaway is oh I'm forced medicating you but it's not my fault, it's Biden's fault.
[27:11.160 --> 27:14.200]  Yeah you're the one telling me to do it, you're the one telling me I'm going to get fired,
[27:14.200 --> 27:17.280]  you're the one forcing the needle into me, you're the one holding me down, no this isn't
[27:17.280 --> 27:25.000]  me, no it's Biden, so it's the perfect scapegoat, Biden is for all of this nonsense, Afghanistan,
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.280]  mandatory vaccines, Biden the perfect scapegoat, the guy who can't even control his own bowel
[27:31.280 --> 27:36.840]  movements and they just say yep you're going to be fired and you're going to lose your
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.400]  job and it's all because of the Biden administration but sorry, get the vaccine, it's not our fault,
[27:41.400 --> 27:45.180]  we love you.
[27:45.180 --> 27:54.120]  So the report at infowars.com, Americans being shamed into getting vaccinated by CDC callers
[27:54.120 --> 28:00.800]  just totally obnoxious, CDC issues, urgent advisory calling on pregnant people to take
[28:00.800 --> 28:07.960]  COVID jabs despite citing spike in deaths and pregnancy complications from COVID and
[28:07.960 --> 28:08.960]  the COVID jab.
[28:08.960 --> 28:12.200]  So oh this is going to hurt you, this is going to give you massive side effects, your baby
[28:12.200 --> 28:16.160]  might not live after this, you may never be able to have another baby but you better get
[28:16.160 --> 28:23.280]  this vaccine because well COVID, see, so throw all logic, throw all reasoning, throw all
[28:23.280 --> 28:30.080]  common sense out the door, I said COVID, did you hear me, did you not hear me, I said COVID.
[28:30.080 --> 28:39.280]  So forget about, see $3.5 trillion equals $0, there's 2,000 genders, everyone I disagree
[28:39.280 --> 28:47.120]  with is a racist and if I say the word COVID it's like abracadabra, COVID, oh, oh, oh,
[28:47.120 --> 28:51.680]  COVID, oh, it's like forget all reasoning, forget all common sense, don't think, don't
[28:51.680 --> 28:57.600]  talk, just COVID, oh, COVID, he said COVID, what do I do, what do I do?
[28:57.600 --> 29:01.640]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[29:01.640 --> 29:02.640]  Me too.
[29:02.640 --> 29:06.600]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling
[29:06.600 --> 29:11.600]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on, it's that immune system health can literally
[29:11.600 --> 29:13.880]  be the difference between life and death.
[29:13.880 --> 29:16.800]  You probably already believe that, I certainly do.
[29:16.800 --> 29:21.120]  So here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based
[29:21.120 --> 29:26.600]  substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:26.600 --> 29:32.040]  Now you'll have to sign a waiver but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[29:56.440 --> 30:03.240]  People ask me, Alex, why did you come out with a new natural organic sleep aid when
[30:03.240 --> 30:07.680]  you already have knockout that works so well with eight natural ingredients?
[30:07.680 --> 30:12.500]  Well because when you've taken a certain organic blend for a decade, like I've taken this product
[30:12.500 --> 30:15.240]  I came up with, it doesn't work as well anymore.
[30:15.240 --> 30:16.240]  That's the way herbs work.
[30:16.240 --> 30:19.920]  Do you go off it a while, come back on it, it works again.
[30:19.920 --> 30:20.920]  So what did I do?
[30:20.920 --> 30:24.040]  I went to the developers and I said make a totally different formula with a lot of other
[30:24.040 --> 30:27.760]  known natural healthy compounds that make you sleep deep and restful because that's what
[30:27.760 --> 30:32.040]  helps your immune system and I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout.
[30:32.040 --> 30:34.360]  Okay, be careful when you take it.
[30:34.360 --> 30:35.680]  It's incredibly strong.
[30:35.680 --> 30:36.680]  It's named down and out.
[30:36.680 --> 30:40.600]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it but it is extremely strong and we are
[30:40.600 --> 30:42.080]  extremely proud of it.
[30:42.080 --> 30:48.080]  It is exclusively available at infowarstore.com, 50% off right now.
[30:48.080 --> 30:52.600]  Sold out for more than four months, now back at stock, get your down and out and your knockout
[30:52.600 --> 30:58.720]  at infowarstore.com today, I thank you for your support because it keeps us on the air.
[30:58.720 --> 31:04.120]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered?
[31:04.120 --> 31:07.840]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store, do you think they would let you in?
[31:07.840 --> 31:10.640]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going
[31:10.640 --> 31:12.520]  to be shoplifting?
[31:12.520 --> 31:18.240]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini-mart to pay
[31:18.240 --> 31:20.800]  for your gas with a bandana on?
[31:20.800 --> 31:22.440]  How far do you think that would get you?
[31:22.440 --> 31:26.840]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space
[31:26.840 --> 31:28.840]  alien?
[31:28.840 --> 31:35.760]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[31:35.760 --> 31:39.560]  The globalists are running a psychological warfare operation on humanity.
[31:39.560 --> 31:43.040]  Only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us.
[31:43.040 --> 31:45.320]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[31:45.320 --> 31:48.880]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud and that it's dangerous and that it causes
[31:48.880 --> 31:51.320]  major medical issues and it's dehumanizing.
[31:51.320 --> 31:53.120]  The film COVID-Land does that.

[31:58.520 --> 32:02.840]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[32:02.840 --> 32:07.320]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including
[32:07.320 --> 32:12.600]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune
[32:12.600 --> 32:13.600]  system.
[32:13.600 --> 32:19.600]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at infowarstore.com.
[32:19.600 --> 32:23.760]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only
[32:23.760 --> 32:28.240]  improve your quality of sleep but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[32:28.240 --> 32:33.080]  Many competitor sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep but RocketRest was
[32:33.080 --> 32:38.220]  specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[32:38.220 --> 32:43.440]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support
[32:43.440 --> 32:46.000]  ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
[32:46.000 --> 32:50.760]  RocketRest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep and wake up feeling rested.
[32:50.760 --> 33:04.680]  So get the new RocketRest formula from Dr. Jones Naturals right now at infowarstore.com.
[33:04.680 --> 33:22.360]  Thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
[16:53.840 --> 33:52.960]  behalf of the center for disease control and prevention.
[33:52.960 --> 33:55.240]  We're unable to answer your call at this time.
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.800]  Please leave your full name, phone number and a brief message and you will return your
[33:59.800 --> 34:01.000]  call as soon as possible.
[34:01.000 --> 34:02.620]  Thank you and have a good day.
[34:02.620 --> 34:05.580]  Record your message at the tone when you are finished.
[34:05.580 --> 34:08.180]  Hang up or press pound for more options.
[34:09.380 --> 34:11.860]  Yes, hello, this is Owen Schreuer.
[34:11.860 --> 34:15.140]  I'm a journalist and a syndicated talk show host
[34:15.140 --> 34:17.140]  from FreeWorldNews.tv.
[34:17.140 --> 34:20.300]  And we have disturbing reports that the CDC
[34:20.300 --> 34:23.340]  has a database of unvaccinated Americans
[34:23.340 --> 34:25.980]  that they are currently using to harass them
[34:25.980 --> 34:29.460]  and pressure them into getting the vaccine.
[34:29.460 --> 34:31.100]  I remember going to school and being told
[34:31.100 --> 34:32.980]  not to fall into peer pressure to take drugs.
[34:32.980 --> 34:35.260]  It seems that you guys are taking the opposite approach.
[34:35.260 --> 34:37.100]  I was curious if the CDC would like
[34:37.100 --> 34:39.220]  to release a statement on this,
[34:39.220 --> 34:43.940]  how it got the database with the unvaccinated Americans
[34:43.940 --> 34:47.140]  to call and harass if that's legal,
[34:47.140 --> 34:48.820]  if there was ever a debate.
[34:48.820 --> 34:50.820]  And you don't have to respond to me personally,
[34:50.820 --> 34:53.540]  but I would suggest that you make a public statement
[34:53.540 --> 34:56.860]  for the world to see or for America to see
[34:56.860 --> 34:59.220]  because a lot of people are concerned
[34:59.220 --> 35:00.420]  with this medical tyranny
[35:00.420 --> 35:02.620]  and now they're winding up on a list
[35:02.620 --> 35:04.700]  causing the CDC and the government to call them
[35:04.700 --> 35:08.420]  and force them into taking an experimental drug.
[35:08.420 --> 35:10.460]  It would be nice for you guys to be transparent about this.
[35:10.460 --> 35:12.660]  We've had a lot of mixed messages from you.
[35:12.660 --> 35:14.100]  My guess is this won't happen,
[35:14.100 --> 35:16.940]  but please prove me wrong and make a public statement
[35:16.940 --> 35:20.420]  about CDC databases being used
[35:20.420 --> 35:23.660]  to harass unvaccinated Americans.
[35:23.660 --> 35:25.260]  We will wait for your answer.
[35:25.260 --> 35:26.100]  Thank you.
[35:26.100 --> 35:31.100]  Okay, so that was us trying to call the CDC here live on air.
[35:32.180 --> 35:35.140]  As you can see, it went to voicemail.
[35:35.140 --> 35:37.860]  So I just went ahead and left them a little voicemail.
[35:37.860 --> 35:41.940]  Maybe they're not taking calls from Texas at this time.
[35:41.940 --> 35:43.980]  In fact, I mean, we could give it another go.
[35:43.980 --> 35:45.580]  My guess is it's probably just gonna be
[35:45.580 --> 35:46.660]  the exact same result,
[35:46.660 --> 35:48.420]  but do we wanna give it another go guys?
[35:48.420 --> 35:52.060]  Just to be sure, as they say, third time's a charm.
[35:52.060 --> 35:53.140]  We tried it once in the break
[35:53.140 --> 35:55.420]  and then we just tried it there live on air.
[35:55.420 --> 35:58.220]  So we'll give it a third time's a charm.
[35:58.220 --> 36:00.420]  We'll see if the CDC can pick up a phone.
[36:00.420 --> 36:23.500]  All right, go ahead and go ahead and cut that.
[36:23.500 --> 36:25.700]  That seems like an ignore.
[36:25.700 --> 36:30.980]  Just one ring and then write to voicemail, huh?
[36:30.980 --> 36:35.420]  Here, here, maybe, maybe we should do this.
[36:35.420 --> 36:42.340]  Maybe if I speak it into existence, I'm not vaccinated.
[36:42.340 --> 36:45.140]  I don't have the COVID vaccine.
[36:45.140 --> 36:51.860]  Maybe if I pre-limb for the phone call, here, here.
[36:51.860 --> 36:57.060]  In case anyone from the federal government is listening,
[36:57.060 --> 37:00.940]  I have not had my COVID-19 vaccine
[37:00.940 --> 37:05.140]  and I do not believe I will ever take my COVID-19 vaccine.
[37:05.140 --> 37:07.140]  If anyone from the federal government
[37:07.140 --> 37:10.940]  is listening right now, I am a non-vaccinated American.
[37:10.940 --> 37:16.660]  Oh.
[37:16.660 --> 37:19.580]  We're sorry it is not necessary to dial a one
[37:19.580 --> 37:21.180]  when calling this number.
[37:21.180 --> 37:23.740]  Please hang up and try your call again.
[37:23.740 --> 37:25.460]  Guys, is that the same number we've been dialing
[37:25.460 --> 37:29.860]  with now a different message?
[37:29.860 --> 37:31.540]  It's always fun.
[37:31.540 --> 37:33.820]  Hey, it's a live show, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:33.820 --> 37:35.580]  Not scripted, not planned.
[37:35.580 --> 37:37.620]  No teleprompters here, just a live show.
[37:37.620 --> 37:40.340]  So now we've got a different voicemail from the CDC
[37:40.340 --> 37:42.220]  that we don't have to dial a one.
[37:42.220 --> 37:44.500]  Let's give it one more go without the one this time then.
[37:44.500 --> 37:47.980]  Again, I'm not vaccinated.
[37:47.980 --> 37:51.420]  Anyone from the CDC wants to know,
[37:51.420 --> 37:54.580]  oh, ensure you're here, not vaccinated.
[37:54.580 --> 37:58.140]  Don't want the vaccine.
[37:58.140 --> 38:00.220]  I don't want to take a vaccine.
[38:00.220 --> 38:02.700]  I never have.
[38:02.700 --> 38:04.540]  I'm not vaccinated, CDC.
[38:04.540 --> 38:05.940]  Am I on your database?
[38:12.860 --> 38:15.780]  We're sorry it is not necessary to dial a one
[38:15.780 --> 38:17.020]  when calling this number.
[38:17.020 --> 38:18.180]  Did we dial a one that time?
[38:18.180 --> 38:19.260]  And try your call again.
[38:22.420 --> 38:25.180]  Well, let's just document that then too.
[38:25.180 --> 38:27.380]  We'll just document that and then live on air.
[38:27.380 --> 38:28.780]  So it's OK.
[38:35.340 --> 38:37.140]  That's what you get if you don't dial a one.
[38:40.820 --> 38:45.580]  Well, I mean, I guess the CDC's lines are busy now.
[38:45.580 --> 38:47.940]  I guess the CDC's lines are all tied up now.
[38:47.940 --> 38:50.060]  Well, there you go.
[38:50.060 --> 38:52.500]  We'll see if they ever return a phone call
[38:52.500 --> 38:54.260]  or make a public statement.
[38:54.260 --> 38:57.340]  My guess is that they won't.
[38:57.340 --> 39:00.020]  And so there you go.
[39:00.020 --> 39:04.500]  But the nonsense coming from the vaccine pushers
[39:04.500 --> 39:07.380]  and their lack of logic just continues.
[39:07.380 --> 39:10.300]  Former Obama administration health and human services
[39:10.300 --> 39:16.100]  Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says, unvaccinated Americans
[39:16.100 --> 39:17.900]  are like secondhand smoke.
[39:17.900 --> 39:20.460]  They can make me and my family sick.
[39:20.460 --> 39:21.540]  But you've been vaccinated.
[39:21.540 --> 39:23.780]  So how is that true?
[39:23.780 --> 39:26.820]  So they admit the vaccine doesn't work.
[39:26.820 --> 39:29.060]  And yet they want to force you to take the vaccine that
[39:29.060 --> 39:29.900]  doesn't work.
[39:32.980 --> 39:34.460]  OK, you've been vaccinated.
[39:34.460 --> 39:35.580]  Can you still get COVID?
[39:35.580 --> 39:36.540]  Yes.
[39:36.540 --> 39:38.460]  Can you still be hospitalized with COVID?
[39:38.460 --> 39:39.380]  Yes.
[39:39.380 --> 39:40.940]  Can you still die from COVID?
[39:40.940 --> 39:41.860]  Yes.
[39:41.860 --> 39:43.500]  Can you still spread COVID?
[39:43.500 --> 39:45.660]  Yes.
[39:45.660 --> 39:47.460]  Can you die from the vaccine?
[39:47.460 --> 39:49.300]  Yes.
[39:49.300 --> 39:52.900]  You, the non-vaccinated, can you get COVID?
[39:52.900 --> 39:55.820]  Yes.
[39:55.820 --> 39:57.420]  Could you die from the vaccine?
[39:57.420 --> 39:58.620]  No.
[39:58.620 --> 40:01.100]  Oh.
[40:01.100 --> 40:02.220]  Hmm.
[40:02.220 --> 40:04.980]  Well, when you lay it out like that,
[40:04.980 --> 40:08.460]  when you put it to me that way, why should I get the vaccine?
[40:08.460 --> 40:09.660]  And they all admit it.
[40:09.660 --> 40:11.700]  Leanna Nguyen goes on CNN and says,
[40:11.700 --> 40:16.540]  now the unvaccinated are at risk because of the vaccinated.
[40:16.540 --> 40:18.700]  The vaccinated cause the variants.
[40:18.700 --> 40:21.220]  The vaccinated are causing the spread.
[40:21.220 --> 40:26.460]  The vaccinated have way more complications with COVID now.
[40:26.460 --> 40:31.020]  Or if not COVID from the vaccine, or both.
[40:31.020 --> 40:32.500]  Here's another one.
[40:32.500 --> 40:36.180]  Antibodies and fully vaccinated with Pfizer and AstraZeneca
[40:36.180 --> 40:39.100]  decline after months.
[40:39.100 --> 40:40.460]  So they admit, oh, it doesn't work.
[40:40.460 --> 40:44.100]  Maybe you have immunity for a month, maybe not, who knows.
[40:44.100 --> 40:47.260]  But if you have natural immunity, you're solid.
[40:47.260 --> 40:47.780]  You're good.
[40:50.460 --> 40:51.300]  All good.
[40:53.740 --> 40:56.900]  In fact, I mean, again, it's like there's so much tyranny now.
[40:56.900 --> 40:58.300]  You don't even want to talk about this stuff.
[40:58.300 --> 41:02.620]  But I was in direct contact, close contact with somebody
[41:02.620 --> 41:05.460]  that had COVID, was sick for COVID.
[41:05.460 --> 41:08.100]  They were actually a friend that was staying with me in my house.
[41:08.100 --> 41:13.300]  So in my house, had COVID, I never got COVID.
[41:13.300 --> 41:14.500]  Never got it.
[41:14.500 --> 41:15.380]  Why?
[41:15.380 --> 41:17.420]  Because I have natural immunity.
[41:17.420 --> 41:18.180]  See?
[41:18.180 --> 41:18.900]  See how that works?
[41:23.660 --> 41:27.060]  But this medical tyranny, it just has to stay.
[41:27.060 --> 41:29.580]  And so we'll get into more of this coming up.
[41:29.580 --> 41:32.700]  Democrats slip plans for $700,000 vaccine
[41:32.700 --> 41:40.780]  compliance fines under US code section, say it with me, 666
[41:40.780 --> 41:41.900]  into budget bill.
[41:41.900 --> 41:45.740]  So all these different COVID measures with 666 in it,
[41:45.740 --> 41:48.340]  it's almost like it's the mark of the beast coming here.
[41:48.340 --> 41:49.860]  We've been warned.
[41:49.860 --> 41:51.380]  So we'll have more of that coming up.
[41:51.380 --> 41:55.260]  And Alex Jones coming up in the bottom of the hour here.
[41:55.260 --> 41:58.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, remember infowarstore.com.

[42:03.060 --> 42:05.420]  Very, very powerful sleep support formula.
[42:05.420 --> 42:09.420]  This is probably the heaviest of the sleep support formulas
[42:09.420 --> 42:10.340]  that we have.
[42:10.340 --> 42:12.140]  And knockout is great.
[42:12.140 --> 42:13.220]  Rocket rest is great.
[42:13.220 --> 42:14.500]  I have all three in my pantry.
[42:14.500 --> 42:17.220]  But down and out is definitely the most hard hitting.
[42:17.220 --> 42:19.220]  It's back in stock, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:19.220 --> 42:22.060]  And 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[42:22.060 --> 42:23.220]  I'd stock up on this.

[42:24.980 --> 42:27.780]  or just likes a little extra help to put you to sleep
[42:27.780 --> 42:28.940]  and keep you asleep.
[42:28.940 --> 42:31.100]  Down and out is the sleep support formula
[42:31.100 --> 42:32.100]  you've been looking for.
[42:32.100 --> 42:35.140]  It's in a liquid tincture, so very easy to just take.
[42:35.140 --> 42:37.580]  I just take two droppers right under the tongue,
[42:37.580 --> 42:41.140]  swallow, and I'm good for however much sleep I need.
[42:41.140 --> 42:44.460]  If the only problem is it knocks you out so good,
[42:44.460 --> 42:46.100]  maybe the next morning, you're probably
[42:46.100 --> 42:49.780]  going to have to take some vitamin B12 or some Brain Force
[42:49.780 --> 42:52.180]  Plus or Brain Force Ultra from infowarstore.com
[42:52.180 --> 42:55.900]  just to get the great sleep you just had behind you.
[42:55.900 --> 42:57.260]  But down and out, 50% off.
[42:57.260 --> 42:59.900]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under
[42:59.900 --> 43:03.380]  now is bad, wait till they've got their world ID in.
[43:03.380 --> 43:07.460]  And that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[43:07.460 --> 43:11.180]  And CloudSwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders
[43:11.180 --> 43:14.380]  own words they admit that once they've got you
[43:14.380 --> 43:17.700]  with that system, then they're going to carbon tax you
[43:17.700 --> 43:20.340]  everywhere you go and track what you do.
[43:20.340 --> 43:21.700]  And publicly, they're saying they're
[43:21.700 --> 43:25.380]  going to decide when you can travel and when you can't travel.
[43:25.380 --> 43:28.380]  And MasterCard and all the other big companies
[43:28.380 --> 43:31.100]  are currently announcing they're going to track what you do
[43:31.100 --> 43:34.660]  and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[43:34.660 --> 43:38.260]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:38.260 --> 43:39.300]  This is the takeover.
[43:39.300 --> 43:41.620]  In humanity, better wake up and say no.
[43:41.620 --> 43:43.340]  Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[43:43.340 --> 43:44.900]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others
[43:44.900 --> 43:46.860]  are leaving the charts along with info wars.
[43:46.860 --> 43:47.620]  But it's not enough.
[43:47.620 --> 43:50.100]  Every individual has to not comply.
[43:50.100 --> 43:51.900]  And we have to talk about bringing the globalists
[43:51.900 --> 43:52.780]  to justice.
[43:52.780 --> 43:54.580]  You see, they need the fear of God
[43:54.580 --> 43:56.940]  put in them legally and lawfully.
[43:56.940 --> 43:58.500]  I got some good news.
[43:58.500 --> 44:01.460]  All the items in front of me are back in stock
[44:01.460 --> 44:04.780]  and are 40% to 50% off and infowarsword.com.
[44:04.780 --> 44:08.100]  The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out.
[44:08.100 --> 44:10.540]  So this sale is only going from one week starting
[44:10.540 --> 44:11.740]  on September 29th.
[44:11.740 --> 44:14.700]  And in the case of green fiber capsules,
[44:14.700 --> 44:18.220]  these will be sold out in just a couple of days, 50% off.
[44:18.220 --> 44:20.420]  We have knockout sleep aid, 50% off.
[44:20.420 --> 44:23.460]  Sold out for months, very popular, twice as strong
[44:23.460 --> 44:24.220]  as knockout.
[44:24.220 --> 44:25.660]  Probably too strong for some people.
[44:25.660 --> 44:27.100]  Totally different formula.
[44:27.100 --> 44:29.900]  Down and out is back in stock, 50% off.
[44:29.900 --> 44:32.380]  We've extended the sale on winter sun and ultra 12,
[44:32.380 --> 44:35.660]  50% off, and also on deep breath crystal iodine,
[44:35.660 --> 44:36.860]  survival selects too.
[44:36.860 --> 44:40.380]  It's all 40% and 50% off for one week only.
[44:40.380 --> 44:42.220]  Take advantage of it and fund the info war.
[44:42.220 --> 44:45.260]  And I thank you all for your support, infowarsword.com
[44:45.260 --> 44:48.980]  or 888-253-3139.
[44:48.980 --> 44:49.900]  It's a win-win.
[44:49.900 --> 44:51.660]  These are things that make you healthy,
[44:51.660 --> 44:54.060]  make your life better, and they fund the info war.
[44:54.060 --> 44:58.460]  Again, all that we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[44:58.460 --> 45:02.100]  You want to have a double-blind randomized placebo
[45:02.100 --> 45:03.940]  testing without what that means.
[45:03.940 --> 45:08.060]  You give 20,000 people the vaccine when it comes to phase
[45:08.060 --> 45:10.420]  two, phase three trials.
[45:10.420 --> 45:13.140]  And you give 20,000 people a placebo.
[45:13.140 --> 45:15.380]  And then you really look at out outcomes
[45:15.380 --> 45:18.780]  for a long period of time, not four weeks.
[45:18.780 --> 45:21.580]  There's a lot of these injuries, the autoimmune injuries.
[45:21.580 --> 45:23.180]  You're not going to see in four weeks.
[45:23.180 --> 45:25.980]  The cancer, you're not going to see in four weeks.
[45:25.980 --> 45:28.020]  And many of the neurological injuries,
[45:28.020 --> 45:29.540]  you won't see for four weeks.
[45:29.540 --> 45:34.100]  If the experience with other vaccines is instructive,
[45:34.100 --> 45:37.900]  look at the other vaccines that are currently in the schedule.
[45:37.900 --> 45:42.460]  And there's about 400 injuries, illnesses, chronic illnesses
[45:42.460 --> 45:43.100]  that are listed.
[45:43.100 --> 45:47.660]  Robert Kennedy Jr. is just one of more than 40 powerful voices
[45:47.660 --> 45:50.540]  in the film COVID Land, exclusively available
[45:50.540 --> 45:52.300]  at covidland.com.
[45:52.300 --> 45:55.100]  When you order it now, you get a free copy of the in-game
[45:55.100 --> 45:58.220]  blueprint for global enslavement.
[45:58.220 --> 46:01.100]  Around the world, the general public
[46:01.100 --> 46:04.620]  has woken up the fact that this isn't a left or right issue.
[46:04.620 --> 46:10.380]  This is a global, corporate, a 10 to 21, a 10 to 30, great reset
[46:10.380 --> 46:11.340]  takeover.
[46:11.340 --> 46:13.780]  This is a technocracy.
[46:13.780 --> 46:18.060]  But very few leaders, Orban, Bolsonaro, and just a few others,
[46:18.060 --> 46:21.540]  are addressing it for what it is to their people.
[46:21.540 --> 46:26.420]  A foreign, anti-human, anti-family, anti-god takeover
[46:26.420 --> 46:29.140]  of the very biological system of humans.
[46:29.140 --> 46:32.620]  This is a corporate takeover of our bodies, of ourselves,
[46:32.620 --> 46:35.300]  with the World ID, the medical tracking system that
[46:35.300 --> 46:36.620]  will be tied to the carbon taxes.
[46:36.620 --> 46:38.060]  It's all been announced.
[46:38.060 --> 46:40.660]  It is a dystopic nightmare.
[46:40.660 --> 46:43.940]  And humanity is starting to organize, but our leaders aren't.
[46:43.940 --> 46:46.980]  We need Senator Paul and Senator Holly and others
[46:46.980 --> 46:48.980]  that have shown some understanding of this
[46:48.980 --> 46:53.180]  and Senator Cruz to organize against this foreign multinational
[46:53.180 --> 46:56.420]  corporate takeovers, or big pharma, big banks, and big tech.
[46:56.420 --> 46:57.620]  Or we have no hope.
[47:01.740 --> 47:04.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:11.460 --> 47:14.060]  Waging war on corruption.
[47:14.060 --> 47:18.180]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[47:18.180 --> 47:21.460]  of the Info War.
[47:21.460 --> 47:26.140]  It's Thursday, September 30, 2021.
[47:26.140 --> 47:30.580]  And the battle plans of the UN and their minions
[47:30.580 --> 47:33.700]  around the world have had on the drawing board
[47:33.700 --> 47:37.460]  is now being implemented.
[47:37.460 --> 47:40.300]  From Australia to Canada to the United States,
[47:40.300 --> 47:45.340]  from the UK to the EU, all major governments,
[47:45.340 --> 47:48.700]  more than 16 months ago, began building
[47:48.700 --> 47:56.020]  giant new, huge holding towns or cities that
[47:56.020 --> 48:01.060]  could hold between 5,000 and 30,000 people.
[48:01.060 --> 48:03.300]  And starting about 14 months ago, the CDC
[48:03.300 --> 48:05.820]  put out a document that deals with, quote,
[48:05.820 --> 48:10.300]  the shielding approach, which is a direct adoption
[48:10.300 --> 48:15.300]  of the United Nations plan of the head of UN rapid reaction
[48:15.300 --> 48:20.100]  forced Dr. Ryan to, quote, shield populations
[48:20.100 --> 48:23.300]  that, quote, do not have COVID or the literature
[48:23.300 --> 48:28.740]  influenza-like viruses from the, quote, rest
[48:28.740 --> 48:34.500]  of the population who are the unvaccinated.
[48:34.500 --> 48:36.020]  Now, I'm going to go through the different reasons
[48:36.020 --> 48:38.740]  for doing this, but the next phase
[48:38.740 --> 48:43.540]  is to begin locking people up for their, quote, safety
[48:43.540 --> 48:45.780]  to break that taboo and set the precedent
[48:45.780 --> 48:48.740]  to live in a permanent maximum North Korea-style police
[48:48.740 --> 48:53.780]  state that Australia is the test case for.
[48:53.780 --> 48:56.260]  That will then organize the mass of people
[48:56.260 --> 48:58.340]  to want to persecute the unvaccinated.
[48:58.340 --> 49:00.180]  And we already predicted this a year and a half ago.
[49:00.180 --> 49:02.220]  We said they're going to roll out the so-called vaccine.
[49:02.220 --> 49:03.740]  It's going to make the vaccinated sick.
[49:03.740 --> 49:05.660]  That's what all the top scientists said it would do.
[49:05.660 --> 49:07.260]  And they're going to blame the unvaccinated.
[49:07.260 --> 49:10.020]  This is all elementary of five-year-olds
[49:10.020 --> 49:13.620]  understand it, if you aren't naive and actually understand
[49:13.620 --> 49:15.620]  the historical lens we're looking through
[49:15.620 --> 49:19.020]  and know the full spectrum of globalist public preparations
[49:19.020 --> 49:24.580]  because this is going from the drawing board to operational.
[49:24.580 --> 49:26.500]  So let me just be very, very clear and then I'll walk
[49:26.500 --> 49:28.900]  through the guts of this.
[49:28.900 --> 49:33.060]  Biden has announced under his new spending bill, almost
[49:33.060 --> 49:36.900]  $4 trillion, build back better.
[49:36.900 --> 49:38.460]  That's like a Nazi Germany saying,
[49:38.460 --> 49:41.260]  I am Vulcan or I am Fuhrer.
[49:41.260 --> 49:44.940]  Or that's like a NASCAR having a slogan for NASCAR.
[49:44.940 --> 49:48.860]  That's like having the NFL and slogan for the NFL.
[49:48.860 --> 49:51.700]  Or a slogan for Coca-Cola, Coke is it.
[49:51.700 --> 49:54.900]  When they say build back better, he's called legislation that,
[49:54.900 --> 49:57.580]  it means imploding our economy, shutting down
[49:57.580 --> 49:59.420]  our industrial economy, and bringing in the, quote,
[49:59.420 --> 50:03.540]  green economy, which will cause total societal collapse
[50:03.540 --> 50:04.300]  and feudalism.
[50:04.300 --> 50:07.500]  So it's an environmental cover for a Marxist-Leninist
[50:07.500 --> 50:09.620]  great leap forward, cultural revolution,
[50:09.620 --> 50:15.140]  like Mao carried out in China, or Lenin and Stalin carried out.
[50:15.140 --> 50:17.060]  Starting in Russia in 1917, it really
[50:17.060 --> 50:20.060]  took them 15 years to consolidate control of Russia.
[50:20.060 --> 50:23.860]  And they even admit it's a Stalinist-Leninist-Maus system.
[50:23.860 --> 50:26.820]  So first, they have all the racial division
[50:26.820 --> 50:28.620]  to divide and conquer us.
[50:28.620 --> 50:30.020]  They ship the jobs overseas.
[50:30.020 --> 50:31.340]  They deindustrialize the country.
[50:31.340 --> 50:32.620]  Then they create vaccine mandates
[50:32.620 --> 50:34.860]  to run the good people of the military and the police.
[50:34.860 --> 50:36.420]  They have the abolish the police movement
[50:36.420 --> 50:38.980]  to get control of the police.
[50:38.980 --> 50:40.140]  They open the borders up.
[50:40.140 --> 50:43.620]  They flood the country to collapse it using clout and beaven.
[50:43.620 --> 50:46.980]  They devalue the currency while the big corporations buy up
[50:46.980 --> 50:49.300]  all the infrastructure.
[50:49.300 --> 50:52.140]  They build giant prisons supposedly for all the criminals,
[50:52.140 --> 50:54.820]  but then can't be those out under COVID and then announce
[50:54.820 --> 50:56.700]  that it's actually for the general public.
[50:56.700 --> 50:58.500]  And again, there's no simple way to tackle all this.
[50:58.500 --> 51:00.460]  I'm just going to pump all the information on the table.
[51:00.460 --> 51:01.860]  You can make what you want.
[51:01.860 --> 51:04.820]  But what I'm getting at here, and what I do announce just
[51:04.820 --> 51:08.380]  up front, is that all the FEMA camp programs
[51:08.380 --> 51:11.940]  and all the roundup camp programs and all of those systems
[51:11.940 --> 51:14.580]  they've been quietly preparing since the days of Rex 84
[51:14.580 --> 51:18.180]  in the 1980s under different pretenses
[51:18.180 --> 51:21.420]  is now being officially rolled out worldwide.
[51:21.420 --> 51:23.700]  They're building giant emergency centers,
[51:23.700 --> 51:26.460]  and they're calling them shield-in-place centers,
[51:26.460 --> 51:29.420]  where again, they talk about locking down neighborhoods,
[51:29.420 --> 51:32.380]  locking down whole cities.
[51:32.380 --> 51:35.980]  They talk about forcibly quarantining the unvaccinated,
[51:35.980 --> 51:38.420]  but also, quote, shielding everyone else
[51:38.420 --> 51:41.380]  inside sports stadiums or inside military bases
[51:41.380 --> 51:42.660]  to, quote, protect them.
[51:42.660 --> 51:44.700]  Now, that will destroy confidence in the economy.
[51:44.700 --> 51:46.900]  It will collapse all the small businesses forever.
[51:46.900 --> 51:48.340]  It will make the lockdowns of a year ago
[51:48.340 --> 51:50.260]  look tame in comparison.
[51:50.260 --> 51:53.700]  And then out of that, only the Walmarts, only the Amazons,
[51:53.700 --> 51:56.940]  only the big chain stores will be able to survive and thrive
[51:56.940 --> 51:58.860]  because there'll be all that's left of the economy.
[51:58.860 --> 52:03.180]  So that's one vertical integration area of siege
[52:03.180 --> 52:04.780]  and economic warfare that this is.
[52:04.780 --> 52:06.620]  But again, it's larger than that.
[52:06.620 --> 52:09.100]  It trains the courts that there's no due process,
[52:09.100 --> 52:10.340]  total class of society.
[52:10.340 --> 52:13.900]  It is the very definition of martial law.
[52:13.900 --> 52:15.980]  And so they're openly, and these articles
[52:15.980 --> 52:20.980]  are all in infowars.com, coming out and stating
[52:22.220 --> 52:25.420]  that there's gonna be $700,000 fines to businesses
[52:25.420 --> 52:27.500]  that don't take the poison unauthorized,
[52:27.500 --> 52:30.740]  unapproved shot, they are saying
[52:30.740 --> 52:32.300]  that under infrastructure emergencies,
[52:32.300 --> 52:34.220]  they're gonna just take over warehouses
[52:34.220 --> 52:36.700]  and trucking when all that breaks down.
[52:36.700 --> 52:41.700]  Because Amazon and Google and Wal-Mart and Target and HEB
[52:43.300 --> 52:45.340]  and all them will be able to keep operating.
[52:45.340 --> 52:47.500]  They have infra-guard infrastructure protection
[52:47.500 --> 52:51.900]  agreements with FEMA that goes back to the 1980s
[52:51.900 --> 52:54.780]  that were made public in the 2000s.
[52:54.780 --> 52:57.340]  And so again, it's corporations, global corporations,
[52:57.340 --> 53:00.780]  creating an emergency to shut down the economy
[53:00.780 --> 53:04.220]  and basically have a hostile takeover of the entire system.
[53:05.340 --> 53:06.740]  In Rome, we do this on a limited level,
[53:06.740 --> 53:08.460]  came out in their own documents where they'd shut the power
[53:08.460 --> 53:10.220]  off for a day or so in California,
[53:10.220 --> 53:12.380]  then say, oh, it's scarce, they learned psychologically,
[53:12.380 --> 53:14.980]  people would accept five times the power bill,
[53:14.980 --> 53:18.100]  they'd make billions a day if they told there were outages,
[53:18.100 --> 53:20.380]  which there weren't, they were just artificially doing.
[53:20.380 --> 53:21.260]  That's the same thing here.
[53:21.260 --> 53:25.340]  This is a giant societal kill switch.
[53:25.340 --> 53:26.940]  And you notice they've already put the internet kill switch
[53:26.940 --> 53:29.020]  on them, panning Trump, restricting Senator Ball
[53:29.020 --> 53:32.500]  and others, that's only gonna accelerate under this,
[53:32.500 --> 53:34.420]  where they can selectively shut everybody they want
[53:34.420 --> 53:36.100]  using AI.
[53:36.100 --> 53:37.700]  So the long and short of it is,
[53:39.460 --> 53:44.460]  Biden's controllers wear a rainbow swastika symbol,
[53:45.260 --> 53:50.140]  a rainbow sun symbol, and when you go to each part
[53:50.140 --> 53:54.900]  of that colored rainbow, it has a different area
[53:54.900 --> 53:58.860]  of the authoritarian corporate takeover system
[53:58.860 --> 54:01.380]  when you look at the pie chart.
[54:01.380 --> 54:05.580]  And when Biden announced and he is spending bill,
[54:05.580 --> 54:10.580]  bill back better, he 100% adopted the globalist slogan
[54:10.900 --> 54:14.740]  of Klaus Schwab, the Bilderberg group in the European Union,
[54:14.740 --> 54:18.580]  and basically set up the flag of surrender into globalism.
[54:18.580 --> 54:21.420]  That's why he shuts down our pipelines like Keystone,
[54:21.420 --> 54:26.420]  and it turns on the Nord Stream 2 from Russia into Germany,
[54:26.540 --> 54:29.500]  because this is the takedown of the United States,
[54:29.500 --> 54:32.860]  and the real alliance is between the United States
[54:32.860 --> 54:36.020]  and the EU and all of the Anglo-American countries,
[54:36.020 --> 54:37.900]  like Australia, New Zealand, Canada,
[54:37.900 --> 54:39.900]  under this globalist dictatorship,
[54:39.900 --> 54:44.100]  not to empower the West, but to subserve the West
[54:44.100 --> 54:47.660]  and go back pre-Magnacarta, pre-Renaissance,
[54:47.660 --> 54:51.300]  and again, bring us back into a feudal state,
[54:51.300 --> 54:54.980]  that's actually, in Endgame 2,
[54:54.980 --> 54:58.740]  that's internet-only that I've been able to find for years,
[54:58.740 --> 55:01.180]  and as somebody founded and posted last night
[55:01.180 --> 55:03.620]  on man.video under another name,
[55:03.620 --> 55:05.060]  an alternate name that was called,
[55:05.060 --> 55:06.660]  another upload we did years ago,
[55:07.860 --> 55:10.660]  called Endgame, The Blueprint of Mad Men,
[55:10.660 --> 55:11.980]  and it's got a lot of that information in it,
[55:11.980 --> 55:14.020]  but I'm digressing here.
[55:15.660 --> 55:17.380]  There's no easy way to go over all this,
[55:17.380 --> 55:19.100]  this is just basically the end of America,
[55:19.100 --> 55:20.500]  as you know it.
[55:20.500 --> 55:22.380]  Every time you comply, it only gets worse,
[55:22.380 --> 55:24.060]  15 days of flat on the curve,
[55:24.060 --> 55:26.060]  again, 500 plus days of the beginning
[55:26.060 --> 55:28.340]  of the end of your life.
[55:28.340 --> 55:29.420]  They want to bring you to your knees,
[55:29.420 --> 55:30.780]  they want to bankrupt you,
[55:30.780 --> 55:32.420]  they want to be able to socially engineer you
[55:32.420 --> 55:35.540]  and to do that, they've got to make you dependent,
[55:35.540 --> 55:37.420]  and so it's about corporate power,
[55:37.420 --> 55:41.300]  it's about the corporations implementing this,
[55:41.300 --> 55:45.060]  regardless of what your local governments want,
[55:45.060 --> 55:47.780]  say or do, and if we don't come together
[55:47.780 --> 55:49.940]  and see what this is and say no,
[55:49.940 --> 55:51.700]  there's no future, so let me get to what I really
[55:51.700 --> 55:53.820]  should have just said up front.
[55:53.820 --> 55:56.900]  The article's on infowars.com, Paul Watson's written it,
[55:56.900 --> 55:59.140]  it's got the documents, it's got the admissions
[55:59.140 --> 56:04.140]  from the battle plans to come out and announce,
[56:04.540 --> 56:06.740]  okay, $700,000 fives, we don't take the injections
[56:06.740 --> 56:09.460]  for instances, and anyone that doesn't go along
[56:09.460 --> 56:11.180]  with this, you're the reason everybody's sick,
[56:11.180 --> 56:12.980]  let's throw you the vaccines,
[56:12.980 --> 56:15.220]  and we're gonna have to end this
[56:15.220 --> 56:17.500]  by basically locking everything down once and for all
[56:17.500 --> 56:19.460]  and ending this, because it's all your fault
[56:19.460 --> 56:21.540]  for not submitting to us that this happened,
[56:21.540 --> 56:23.940]  that'll play everybody off against each other,
[56:23.940 --> 56:26.700]  and then out of that, it permanently breaks the economy
[56:26.700 --> 56:31.420]  in the cloud pivot strategy to take over our civilization,
[56:31.420 --> 56:35.500]  and it's a worldwide plan, and it's totally evil,
[56:35.500 --> 56:38.340]  and we'll basically never come out of it if we accept it,
[56:39.500 --> 56:43.420]  and they're hiring now hundreds of thousands of people
[56:43.420 --> 56:47.300]  and tens of thousands of managers to orchestrate
[56:47.300 --> 56:50.060]  and run all the sheltering in place,
[56:50.060 --> 56:52.860]  shield in place programs, and they've put out
[56:52.860 --> 56:56.140]  the federal ads for that on a state-by-state basis,
[56:56.140 --> 56:58.820]  thousands for this state, thousands for that state,
[56:58.820 --> 57:01.260]  and they're gonna go ahead with this, again,
[57:01.260 --> 57:03.540]  to totally break the economy, consolidate power,
[57:03.540 --> 57:06.660]  this is war, this is a globalist occupation force
[57:06.660 --> 57:09.860]  that is dissolving the very nation's existence,
[57:09.860 --> 57:11.500]  and everybody better understand who thinks
[57:11.500 --> 57:12.740]  they're part of the establishment,
[57:12.740 --> 57:14.020]  you're gonna get run over and destroyed
[57:14.020 --> 57:16.820]  by this process as well, they're then gonna reorganize
[57:16.820 --> 57:18.700]  the global economy under the great reset
[57:18.700 --> 57:21.140]  and make even the ultra-rich and, quote, wealthy handover
[57:21.140 --> 57:24.180]  most of their wealth to this big, globalist, fascist,
[57:24.180 --> 57:27.060]  communist consortium of the ultra-super-rich,
[57:27.060 --> 57:29.300]  which will then actually give some of that money
[57:29.300 --> 57:31.900]  to the lower class, but it's gonna be devalued,
[57:31.900 --> 57:34.220]  and then the lower class will then be fully weaponized
[57:34.220 --> 57:37.660]  for the next phase, basically a giant malice revolution.
[57:37.660 --> 57:41.260]  All right, back to Owen Schreuer and the live broadcast.
[57:41.260 --> 57:47.260]  God bless and good luck.
[57:47.260 --> 57:49.500]  And in addition, we were really finding
[57:49.500 --> 57:51.780]  that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems
[57:51.780 --> 57:54.580]  of these employees, because when you cover the mouth
[57:54.580 --> 57:57.980]  and nose and you exert physical energy during your work,
[57:57.980 --> 58:00.220]  during your tasks, whatever it might be,
[58:00.220 --> 58:02.260]  you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary system
[58:02.260 --> 58:04.100]  because you change the way that you breathe,
[58:04.100 --> 58:07.420]  you have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[58:07.420 --> 58:10.380]  That taxes the heart, it taxes the lungs,
[58:10.380 --> 58:12.180]  and we have given people heart attacks
[58:12.180 --> 58:15.940]  by allowing them to work with their mouth and nose covered
[58:15.940 --> 58:19.820]  with absolutely no regulation, no oversight,
[58:19.820 --> 58:21.700]  no medical oversight.
[58:21.700 --> 58:23.900]  The globalists have told us we're a disease.
[58:23.900 --> 58:25.700]  They've told us they wanna eradicate us,
[58:25.700 --> 58:27.780]  and all the studies show that when you wear these masks,
[58:27.780 --> 58:30.820]  it lowers your oxygen level up to one third
[58:30.820 --> 58:34.740]  and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[58:34.740 --> 58:37.380]  This is a sick cult, and we've gotta say no,
[58:37.380 --> 58:38.780]  but the only way the real science
[58:38.780 --> 58:41.340]  of the public is if we tell them,
[58:41.340 --> 58:44.460]  get your copy today of COVIDland and expose them.
[58:44.460 --> 58:46.660]  It's covidland.com, go there now.
[58:48.180 --> 58:50.780]  My business model is very, very simple.
[58:50.780 --> 58:54.580]  I wanna bring you products that work really, really well
[58:54.580 --> 58:56.620]  at affordable prices that are competitive
[58:56.620 --> 59:00.060]  so that you'll shop with us, and so we form a relationship
[59:00.060 --> 59:03.700]  so we're able to stay on air and fight the globalist
[59:03.700 --> 59:05.780]  and have good products that make us healthy,
[59:05.780 --> 59:08.180]  make us wiser, that boost our immune system,
[59:08.180 --> 59:09.340]  and that's what we've done.
[59:09.340 --> 59:10.900]  Now, one area of the immune system
[59:10.900 --> 59:13.500]  we don't talk enough about is deep restful sleep.
[59:13.500 --> 59:14.660]  You can look it up for yourself.
[59:14.660 --> 59:16.380]  The effects of deep restful sleep
[59:16.380 --> 59:17.780]  on health and the immune system,
[59:17.780 --> 59:19.500]  and so with everything we're doing out there
[59:19.500 --> 59:21.340]  to boost our immune system with vitamin D
[59:21.340 --> 59:23.060]  and zinc and all of it, that's great,
[59:23.060 --> 59:25.340]  but deep restful sleep is just as important,
[59:25.340 --> 59:26.620]  maybe more important.
[59:26.620 --> 59:30.820]  So, infowarstore.com now can announce 50% off
[59:30.820 --> 59:32.780]  on our best-selling product, Down and Out,
[59:32.780 --> 59:35.220]  that just came back in after four months being sold out.
[59:35.220 --> 59:37.380]  It's 50% off, it's super strong,
[59:37.380 --> 59:38.460]  so be careful with it.
[59:38.460 --> 59:41.220]  If you want deep restful sleep, this will do it.
[59:41.220 --> 59:42.180]  Everybody loves it.
[59:42.180 --> 59:45.460]  Five stars, infowarstore.com, Down and Out.
[59:45.460 --> 59:47.780]  Now, back in stock, 50% off.
[59:51.140 --> 59:54.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:54.140 --> 1:00:01.140]  We're into hour number two of the Alex Jones Show here today.
[1:00:21.300 --> 1:00:23.180]  Let me do this.
[1:00:23.180 --> 1:00:29.180]  Before I get back into the stacks of news,
[1:00:29.180 --> 1:00:32.660]  it's a very complex thing, but it can be boiled down
[1:00:32.660 --> 1:00:37.540]  into a simple way to understand it
[1:00:37.540 --> 1:00:42.140]  with the global government, the corporate world government.
[1:00:42.140 --> 1:00:44.260]  They're so powerful, they have so much leverage
[1:00:44.260 --> 1:00:47.580]  over the free market that they have no use
[1:00:47.580 --> 1:00:50.220]  for the useless eater anymore, for the consumer.
[1:00:50.220 --> 1:00:53.700]  So it's a corporate world government takeover.
[1:00:53.700 --> 1:01:00.020]  At the very core of it is a eugenics-based program
[1:01:00.020 --> 1:01:02.940]  where they have decided that they are the enlightened ones
[1:01:02.940 --> 1:01:06.940]  and there is a limited amount of resources on Earth,
[1:01:06.940 --> 1:01:11.340]  meaning there is a timetable for humans on planet Earth,
[1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:13.940]  and so therefore they have deemed themselves
[1:01:13.940 --> 1:01:19.540]  as the management, if you will, of planet Earth
[1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:23.460]  and by their rulings or measurements,
[1:01:23.460 --> 1:01:25.380]  they've just decided we have too many people,
[1:01:25.380 --> 1:01:27.380]  so we're going to call the people of planet Earth.
[1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:30.180]  That's the only way we can sustain humanity on planet Earth
[1:01:30.180 --> 1:01:32.460]  is by killing humanity on planet Earth.
[1:01:32.460 --> 1:01:35.340]  And they will release their white papers
[1:01:35.340 --> 1:01:36.980]  and they mentioned this during TED Talks,
[1:01:36.980 --> 1:01:39.180]  but they don't really get serious and tell you about it
[1:01:39.180 --> 1:01:41.460]  because, well, then you would stand up against it
[1:01:41.460 --> 1:01:42.900]  and say, no, I want to live.
[1:01:45.420 --> 1:01:48.620]  And so they're really targeting the youth with this
[1:01:48.620 --> 1:01:54.780]  because it's the youth that doesn't have instilled in them
[1:01:54.780 --> 1:01:59.140]  the values of freedom and independence and liberty,
[1:01:59.140 --> 1:02:02.420]  and now your two or three generations
[1:02:02.420 --> 1:02:06.980]  are moved from war heroes and it's maybe
[1:02:06.980 --> 1:02:09.740]  rarer now that you come from a line of people
[1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:12.060]  that fought in a war or fought for America
[1:02:12.060 --> 1:02:16.060]  or died for America, so they just don't care.
[1:02:16.060 --> 1:02:18.820]  And Greta Thunberg is one of the people
[1:02:18.820 --> 1:02:20.140]  that they're using for this.
[1:02:20.140 --> 1:02:22.980]  And she spoke, and so I don't usually
[1:02:22.980 --> 1:02:25.460]  like to cover Greta Thunberg for obvious reasons,
[1:02:25.460 --> 1:02:29.420]  but I thought I should play this climate summit
[1:02:29.420 --> 1:02:31.820]  that she spoke at and just a little clip from her speech
[1:02:31.820 --> 1:02:36.580]  to just show you how clown-worldish it actually is
[1:02:36.580 --> 1:02:41.100]  and how it's actually debasing human knowledge.
[1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:45.420]  But see, humans have to be less empowered by knowledge
[1:02:45.420 --> 1:02:47.340]  and information in order for the new world order
[1:02:47.340 --> 1:02:49.660]  to be successfully carried out.
[1:02:49.660 --> 1:02:52.220]  Because if you're actually informed in a thinker
[1:02:52.220 --> 1:02:54.980]  or tuned into God, the Creator, well,
[1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:57.660]  then you wouldn't stand for any of this at all.
[1:02:57.660 --> 1:02:59.740]  And of course, that's the big separation
[1:02:59.740 --> 1:03:02.180]  with people who believe in population control or eugenics
[1:03:02.180 --> 1:03:05.340]  is they're not Christians or they're not religious at all.
[1:03:05.340 --> 1:03:06.940]  They don't believe in God, the Creator.
[1:03:06.940 --> 1:03:08.420]  When you do believe in God, the Creator,
[1:03:08.420 --> 1:03:10.540]  you understand that you put your faith in that
[1:03:10.540 --> 1:03:12.140]  and your faith in God.
[1:03:12.140 --> 1:03:14.340]  And once you've even lived that life,
[1:03:14.340 --> 1:03:15.700]  you understand how it works.
[1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:17.940]  It's a mystical thing, but it's very real.
[1:03:17.940 --> 1:03:20.300]  It's almost like karma.
[1:03:20.300 --> 1:03:22.900]  But here's Greta Thunberg.
[1:03:22.900 --> 1:03:26.140]  Listen to how dumb this is.
[1:03:26.140 --> 1:03:29.500]  And it's first the dumbness of it
[1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:31.780]  where she literally says blah, blah, blah,
[1:03:31.780 --> 1:03:34.220]  and gets a standing ovation, not even kidding you.
[1:03:34.220 --> 1:03:37.460]  And then the cult-level programming of it at the end,
[1:03:37.460 --> 1:03:39.860]  here's a short clip of Greta Thunberg's speech
[1:03:39.860 --> 1:03:42.940]  from a climate committee this week.
[1:03:42.940 --> 1:03:47.140]  There is no planet, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[1:03:47.140 --> 1:03:48.620]  blah, blah, blah.
[1:03:48.620 --> 1:03:50.620]  Whoo-hoo-hoo.
[1:03:50.620 --> 1:03:52.620]  What do we want?
[1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:54.620]  No, no, no.
[1:03:54.620 --> 1:03:55.620]  When do we want it?
[1:03:55.620 --> 1:03:57.620]  No.
[1:03:57.620 --> 1:03:59.620]  No.
[1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:03.620]  I mean, it's folks.
[1:04:03.620 --> 1:04:08.620]  It's mental illness level stuff.
[1:04:08.620 --> 1:04:11.620]  And see, I actually feel bad.
[1:04:11.620 --> 1:04:14.020]  I mean, usually I'm the guy that'll say retarded
[1:04:14.020 --> 1:04:18.500]  and not feel any qualms about it because it's a word.
[1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:20.500]  But Greta Thunberg may actually have, like,
[1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:22.900]  actual diagnosable mental disabilities.
[1:04:22.900 --> 1:04:23.900]  And so I feel bad.
[1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:26.180]  I'm not going to sit here and say, oh, look, that's retard level.
[1:04:26.180 --> 1:04:28.740]  She might actually have mental disabilities.
[1:04:28.740 --> 1:04:35.540]  But see, they use her and they use the ignorance of the youth
[1:04:35.540 --> 1:04:38.380]  and they use the inexperience of the youth
[1:04:38.380 --> 1:04:39.900]  to just buy all of these lives.
[1:04:39.900 --> 1:04:42.300]  But you can see how debased it is.
[1:04:42.300 --> 1:04:45.500]  And you can see how unintellectual it is when she says,
[1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:49.340]  blah, blah, blah, blah, oh, oh.
[1:04:49.340 --> 1:04:52.020]  And then they have their little cult-like programming
[1:04:52.020 --> 1:04:57.820]  at the end, too, where they cheer and say exactly what she says.
[1:04:57.820 --> 1:05:01.660]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank
[1:05:01.660 --> 1:05:03.260]  with your face covered?
[1:05:03.260 --> 1:05:05.340]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store?
[1:05:05.340 --> 1:05:07.060]  Do you think they would let you in?
[1:05:07.060 --> 1:05:09.140]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles
[1:05:09.140 --> 1:05:11.700]  to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting?
[1:05:11.700 --> 1:05:15.780]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station
[1:05:15.780 --> 1:05:18.580]  and going inside the little mini-mart to pay for your gas
[1:05:18.580 --> 1:05:19.980]  with a bandana on?
[1:05:19.980 --> 1:05:21.580]  How far do you think that would get you?
[1:05:21.580 --> 1:05:24.220]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school
[1:05:24.220 --> 1:05:27.820]  with a shield that looks like a space alien?
[1:05:27.820 --> 1:05:31.220]  Those things are offensive to us
[1:05:31.220 --> 1:05:35.020]  because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[1:05:35.020 --> 1:05:36.940]  The globalists are running a psychological war
[1:05:36.940 --> 1:05:38.540]  for operational humanity.
[1:05:38.540 --> 1:05:42.260]  Only waking up to the Great Reset in its tyranny will save us.
[1:05:42.260 --> 1:05:44.540]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[1:05:44.540 --> 1:05:46.700]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud,
[1:05:46.700 --> 1:05:47.700]  and that it's dangerous,
[1:05:47.700 --> 1:05:49.540]  and that it causes major medical issues,
[1:05:49.540 --> 1:05:50.540]  and it's dehumanizing.
[1:05:50.540 --> 1:05:52.060]  And the film, COVID Land, does that.

[1:06:01.620 --> 1:06:05.100]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[1:06:05.100 --> 1:06:07.060]  it's Owen Troyer.
[1:06:07.060 --> 1:06:10.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:06:10.060 --> 1:06:13.060]  All right, I'll tell you what.
[1:06:13.060 --> 1:06:16.060]  We've been talking the COVID tyranny and stuff
[1:06:16.060 --> 1:06:18.060]  for most of this hour,
[1:06:18.060 --> 1:06:20.060]  and so I want to just switch lanes here.
[1:06:20.060 --> 1:06:22.060]  And of course, we will get back to it.
[1:06:22.060 --> 1:06:23.060]  It's the big story.
[1:06:23.060 --> 1:06:24.060]  Oh, not to mention,
[1:06:24.060 --> 1:06:26.060]  we do have Joe Hoff from the Gateway Pundit
[1:06:26.060 --> 1:06:29.060]  joining me in the one o'clock central hour.
[1:06:29.060 --> 1:06:30.060]  So in the third hour today,
[1:06:30.060 --> 1:06:32.060]  looking forward to talking to Joe.
[1:06:32.060 --> 1:06:36.060]  But let me just switch lanes for a second here.
[1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:39.060]  The Congressional Baseball Game,
[1:06:39.060 --> 1:06:44.060]  a tradition in Washington, D.C. for Congress.
[1:06:44.060 --> 1:06:47.060]  And it's amazing to think about how you had
[1:06:47.060 --> 1:06:52.060]  the Congressional Baseball Game back this year.
[1:06:52.060 --> 1:06:56.060]  And we don't even talk about the attempt of mass murder
[1:06:56.060 --> 1:06:59.060]  that happened, what was it, four years ago, I believe,
[1:06:59.060 --> 1:07:01.060]  at the Congressional Baseball Game that tried
[1:07:01.060 --> 1:07:03.060]  an attempted mass murder by a Democrat,
[1:07:03.060 --> 1:07:05.060]  by a liberal progressive.
[1:07:05.060 --> 1:07:07.060]  Do we forget about James Hodgkinson?
[1:07:07.060 --> 1:07:11.060]  Do we forget about how he tried to commit a mass shooting
[1:07:11.060 --> 1:07:13.060]  at the Republican Baseball Practice?
[1:07:13.060 --> 1:07:15.060]  Do we remember that?
[1:07:15.060 --> 1:07:18.060]  The media didn't even cover it at the time.
[1:07:18.060 --> 1:07:20.060]  They covered it up.
[1:07:20.060 --> 1:07:22.060]  Yeah, I'll play what about ism.
[1:07:22.060 --> 1:07:25.060]  Can you imagine if somebody showed up to the Democrat
[1:07:25.060 --> 1:07:27.060]  baseball practice in a Trump hat
[1:07:27.060 --> 1:07:31.060]  and tried to commit a mass murder and a mass shooting?
[1:07:31.060 --> 1:07:33.060]  Every year during the Congressional Baseball Game,
[1:07:33.060 --> 1:07:35.060]  they'd make it all about that and they'd do ceremonies
[1:07:35.060 --> 1:07:37.060]  and everything and they'd be honoring the Democrats
[1:07:37.060 --> 1:07:39.060]  that shot, but no, because it was a Democrat
[1:07:39.060 --> 1:07:42.060]  that attempted mass murder and because it was Republicans
[1:07:42.060 --> 1:07:45.060]  that got shot, the media's not interested in covering that.
[1:07:45.060 --> 1:07:47.060]  They cover it up.
[1:07:47.060 --> 1:07:50.060]  So they don't celebrate Steve Scalise being back healthy,
[1:07:50.060 --> 1:07:53.060]  able to attend and play the Congressional Baseball Game
[1:07:53.060 --> 1:07:56.060]  or Rand Paul or all the Republicans that were attempted
[1:07:56.060 --> 1:07:59.060]  to be murdered that day.
[1:07:59.060 --> 1:08:02.060]  They don't make a big thing of it,
[1:08:02.060 --> 1:08:06.060]  but that's what it was.
[1:08:06.060 --> 1:08:08.060]  Could you say The New York Times inspired it?
[1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:10.060]  The New York Times writes a story saying,
[1:08:10.060 --> 1:08:12.060]  hey, look, there's a Republican baseball practice
[1:08:12.060 --> 1:08:16.060]  at this field and there's no security.
[1:08:16.060 --> 1:08:18.060]  And then a reader of The New York Times
[1:08:18.060 --> 1:08:22.060]  and a liberal progressive Democrat, James Hoskinson,
[1:08:22.060 --> 1:08:25.060]  drives from Missouri to D.C. with his rifle
[1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:27.060]  and attempts mass murder and a mass shooting
[1:08:27.060 --> 1:08:30.060]  and the media doesn't cover it because he's a Democrat.
[1:08:30.060 --> 1:08:32.060]  Again, a Republican, a conservative does that,
[1:08:32.060 --> 1:08:34.060]  you would never hear the end of it,
[1:08:34.060 --> 1:08:36.060]  but because a Democrat and a liberal does it,
[1:08:36.060 --> 1:08:38.060]  oh, we don't talk about that, we don't cover that,
[1:08:38.060 --> 1:08:40.060]  we're not going to mention that.
[1:08:40.060 --> 1:08:42.060]  But we will.
[1:08:42.060 --> 1:08:46.060]  Yes, Democrat and media inspired James Hoskinson
[1:08:46.060 --> 1:08:49.060]  tried to commit mass murder,
[1:08:49.060 --> 1:08:51.060]  tried to commit a mass shooting
[1:08:51.060 --> 1:08:53.060]  at the Republican baseball practice
[1:08:53.060 --> 1:08:56.060]  before the Congressional Baseball Game.
[1:08:56.060 --> 1:08:59.060]  That's an actual terrorist.
[1:08:59.060 --> 1:09:04.060]  They always seem to wind up on one side of the aisle, don't they?
[1:09:04.060 --> 1:09:08.060]  So you had that happen
[1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:10.060]  and the Congressional Baseball Game, though,
[1:09:10.060 --> 1:09:12.060]  went off without a hitch.
[1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:14.060]  You had the first home run from Greg Stubey.
[1:09:14.060 --> 1:09:16.060]  Is it Stube or Stubey? I don't even know,
[1:09:16.060 --> 1:09:18.060]  but Republican representative actually hit a home run
[1:09:18.060 --> 1:09:20.060]  over the fence for the first time in almost 60 years,
[1:09:20.060 --> 1:09:22.060]  I think it was.
[1:09:22.060 --> 1:09:25.060]  But perhaps the highlight was, once again,
[1:09:25.060 --> 1:09:28.060]  Joe Biden showing up and doing what Joe Biden does best,
[1:09:28.060 --> 1:09:31.060]  and that's getting booed and then harassing women.
[1:09:31.060 --> 1:09:35.060]  We've got both of that. Here is in clip three, guys.
[1:09:35.060 --> 1:09:39.060]  Joe Biden gets the arrives and gets introduced
[1:09:39.060 --> 1:09:41.060]  at the Congressional Baseball Game
[1:09:41.060 --> 1:09:43.060]  and this is what it sounded like.
[1:09:43.060 --> 1:10:00.060]  Boy, that's about a crowd of 10,000 people.
[1:10:00.060 --> 1:10:03.060]  They're booing Joe Biden in D.C. at the Nationals Ballpark.
[1:10:03.060 --> 1:10:07.060]  Now, I have not been able to...
[1:10:07.060 --> 1:10:12.060]  Yeah, there's the bomb from Stubey.
[1:10:12.060 --> 1:10:16.060]  Into the front row.
[1:10:16.060 --> 1:10:19.060]  He was wearing a Save America hat, by the way,
[1:10:19.060 --> 1:10:22.060]  so it empowered him to hit a 400-foot bomb.
[1:10:22.060 --> 1:10:24.060]  But no, okay, so there's Joe Biden.
[1:10:24.060 --> 1:10:26.060]  He shows up, he gets booed.
[1:10:26.060 --> 1:10:28.060]  Now, I have not been able to...
[1:10:28.060 --> 1:10:30.060]  I don't know anybody who's been able to identify
[1:10:30.060 --> 1:10:34.060]  who this lady is that Biden was harassing last night,
[1:10:34.060 --> 1:10:38.060]  but Biden, in typical Biden fashion,
[1:10:38.060 --> 1:10:40.060]  shows up a stadium of 10,000 people
[1:10:40.060 --> 1:10:42.060]  in Washington, D.C., mind you.
[1:10:42.060 --> 1:10:44.060]  In Washington, D.C., mind you,
[1:10:44.060 --> 1:10:46.060]  he gets booed out of the building
[1:10:46.060 --> 1:10:49.060]  and then he finds the first young woman he can
[1:10:49.060 --> 1:10:53.060]  to go harass and he creeps up behind her
[1:10:53.060 --> 1:10:55.060]  and then boxes her in,
[1:10:55.060 --> 1:10:57.060]  and as you can see here,
[1:10:57.060 --> 1:11:00.060]  she's standing against the railing of the dugout.
[1:11:00.060 --> 1:11:03.060]  Biden creeps up from behind her,
[1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:04.060]  puts his arms around her,
[1:11:04.060 --> 1:11:07.060]  and grabs the railing to box her in.
[1:11:07.060 --> 1:11:10.060]  This is a total creep move.
[1:11:10.060 --> 1:11:15.060]  This is a harasser-abuser move from Joe Biden.
[1:11:15.060 --> 1:11:17.060]  Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[1:11:17.060 --> 1:11:20.060]  Where's the mask, Joe?
[1:11:20.060 --> 1:11:25.060]  Where's your mask, Joe?
[1:11:25.060 --> 1:11:27.060]  Pelosi's out there without a mask.
[1:11:27.060 --> 1:11:29.060]  There's a funny video of her on the phone
[1:11:29.060 --> 1:11:31.060]  like screaming at somebody.
[1:11:31.060 --> 1:11:33.060]  No mask, none of them were wearing masks.
[1:11:33.060 --> 1:11:35.060]  I guess they didn't realize that the cameras were on
[1:11:35.060 --> 1:11:37.060]  and that C-SPAN was doing a live broadcast
[1:11:37.060 --> 1:11:39.060]  of the baseball game
[1:11:39.060 --> 1:11:40.060]  because all the Democrats that tell you
[1:11:40.060 --> 1:11:43.060]  you need to wear masks weren't wearing masks
[1:11:43.060 --> 1:11:45.060]  and they didn't even double mask, folks,
[1:11:45.060 --> 1:11:47.060]  not even a single triple mask out there,
[1:11:47.060 --> 1:11:49.060]  not even a triple job,
[1:11:49.060 --> 1:11:55.060]  not even the dub deuce.
[1:11:55.060 --> 1:11:57.060]  So who knows what Pelosi's screaming?
[1:11:57.060 --> 1:11:59.060]  And there's also a clip of Pelosi from this morning
[1:11:59.060 --> 1:12:01.060]  appearing to be drunk, by the way.
[1:12:01.060 --> 1:12:03.060]  We may play that coming up.
[1:12:03.060 --> 1:12:06.060]  Just totals, just weirdness coming from this woman,
[1:12:06.060 --> 1:12:08.060]  this deranged lunatic.
[1:12:08.060 --> 1:12:10.060]  But so Biden shows up,
[1:12:10.060 --> 1:12:13.060]  a crowd of 10,000 in Washington, D.C.,
[1:12:13.060 --> 1:12:15.060]  boozed him,
[1:12:15.060 --> 1:12:17.060]  and then he goes and finds the first victim
[1:12:17.060 --> 1:12:19.060]  he can for his harassment,
[1:12:19.060 --> 1:12:21.060]  and he boxes her in by putting his arms
[1:12:21.060 --> 1:12:23.060]  against the railing so she can't escape.
[1:12:23.060 --> 1:12:28.060]  A total pervert harasser, serial harasser move.
[1:12:28.060 --> 1:12:32.060]  But that's creepy Uncle Joe.
[1:12:32.060 --> 1:12:34.060]  And so we know about the perversions,
[1:12:34.060 --> 1:12:36.060]  the sexual perversions of his family,
[1:12:36.060 --> 1:12:38.060]  so it shouldn't surprise anybody
[1:12:38.060 --> 1:12:40.060]  that Joe Biden had to creep on that lady
[1:12:40.060 --> 1:12:43.060]  and then box her in with his arms
[1:12:43.060 --> 1:12:46.060]  after getting booed.
[1:12:46.060 --> 1:12:48.060]  So again, I'm not sure who it is.
[1:12:48.060 --> 1:12:50.060]  I don't know if anybody has been able to ID her,
[1:12:50.060 --> 1:12:52.060]  but Biden certainly ID'd her
[1:12:52.060 --> 1:12:54.060]  and he got right up in her face, right up behind her
[1:12:54.060 --> 1:12:56.060]  and boxed her in, and he had a great time with it
[1:12:56.060 --> 1:12:58.060]  because he's all powerful.
[1:12:58.060 --> 1:13:00.060]  He can harass her.
[1:13:00.060 --> 1:13:02.060]  He's like the Cuomo's.
[1:13:02.060 --> 1:13:05.060]  Yeah, we seriously harass women.
[1:13:05.060 --> 1:13:08.060]  Yeah, I grab women's buttocks at the bar.
[1:13:08.060 --> 1:13:12.060]  That's me, a Democrat, Cuomo.
[1:13:12.060 --> 1:13:16.060]  And then it was out of Slate magazine.
[1:13:16.060 --> 1:13:18.060]  I covered this on the war room.
[1:13:18.060 --> 1:13:20.060]  Didn't really hear anybody else cover it, quite frankly.
[1:13:20.060 --> 1:13:22.060]  A couple people out there covered it,
[1:13:22.060 --> 1:13:24.060]  but it pretty much went uncovered
[1:13:24.060 --> 1:13:28.060]  how the actual grassroots men
[1:13:28.060 --> 1:13:32.060]  members of the Me Too, Times Up movement
[1:13:32.060 --> 1:13:35.060]  have completely rebuked it now
[1:13:35.060 --> 1:13:39.060]  because most recently with the accusers of Cuomo,
[1:13:39.060 --> 1:13:43.060]  they found out that Times Up and Me Too
[1:13:43.060 --> 1:13:46.060]  were using their funds to pay people
[1:13:46.060 --> 1:13:49.060]  to go after the women that accused Cuomo.
[1:13:49.060 --> 1:13:53.060]  The women, not Cuomo, the victims of Cuomo.
[1:13:53.060 --> 1:13:56.060]  So they wrote a huge piece in Slate magazine
[1:13:56.060 --> 1:13:59.060]  saying what happened to the Times Up movement
[1:13:59.060 --> 1:14:01.060]  and it gets all about how they basically discovered
[1:14:01.060 --> 1:14:04.060]  that at the top level it was a grift.
[1:14:04.060 --> 1:14:07.060]  The big executives at these movements
[1:14:07.060 --> 1:14:09.060]  were just making a bunch of money
[1:14:09.060 --> 1:14:12.060]  and how it was really just a Democrat front group.
[1:14:12.060 --> 1:14:14.060]  And they just admit all of it.
[1:14:14.060 --> 1:14:16.060]  This is coming from Democrats that were involved
[1:14:16.060 --> 1:14:18.060]  getting in for the right reasons, thinking,
[1:14:18.060 --> 1:14:20.060]  hey, we're not going to have people harassing women anymore.
[1:14:20.060 --> 1:14:22.060]  Men of power harassing women.
[1:14:22.060 --> 1:14:24.060]  They got in it for that reason
[1:14:24.060 --> 1:14:26.060]  and why?
[1:14:26.060 --> 1:14:29.060]  They discovered it was all a lie
[1:14:29.060 --> 1:14:33.060]  and when they went to attack the women
[1:14:33.060 --> 1:14:35.060]  of the women that accused Cuomo,
[1:14:35.060 --> 1:14:39.060]  that's when they realized that they had been completely duped.
[1:14:39.060 --> 1:14:42.060]  No, it was always a Democrat front.
[1:14:42.060 --> 1:14:44.060]  It was always a Democrat operation
[1:14:44.060 --> 1:14:48.060]  and its real agenda was just to get Trump.
[1:14:48.060 --> 1:14:51.060]  So they found that out the hard way.
[1:14:51.060 --> 1:14:54.060]  Now, of course, InfoWars told you that from day one
[1:14:54.060 --> 1:14:57.060]  but that's just the pace of play around here.
[1:14:57.060 --> 1:15:00.060]  And so that's why it's important to keep InfoWars on air.
[1:15:00.060 --> 1:15:03.060]  That's why the New World Order wants us off the air
[1:15:03.060 --> 1:15:05.060]  as much as they want anything else.
[1:15:05.060 --> 1:15:08.060]  They'd love to see Alex Jones and InfoWars off the air.
[1:15:08.060 --> 1:15:10.060]  But because of your prayers and your support,
[1:15:10.060 --> 1:15:12.060]  your word of mouth and your spreading the links

[1:16:29.060 --> 1:16:31.060]  your voice counts.
[1:16:31.060 --> 1:16:34.060]  When you share information, be it over the internet
[1:16:34.060 --> 1:16:36.060]  or in person, it changes the world.
[1:16:36.060 --> 1:16:39.060]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular,
[1:16:39.060 --> 1:16:40.060]  they know you're angry.
[1:16:40.060 --> 1:16:42.060]  And now to get around big tech,
[1:16:42.060 --> 1:16:45.060]  it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[1:16:45.060 --> 1:16:47.060]  Well, ladies and gentlemen,

[1:17:50.060 --> 1:18:02.060]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders
[1:18:02.060 --> 1:18:04.060]  because our audience understands
[1:18:04.060 --> 1:18:07.060]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet
[1:18:07.060 --> 1:18:10.060]  by design and are attempting to cause
[1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:13.060]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:18:13.060 --> 1:18:15.060]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:18:15.060 --> 1:18:17.060]  storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[1:18:17.060 --> 1:18:19.060]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have
[1:18:19.060 --> 1:18:22.060]  taken care of right along with water filtration,
[1:18:22.060 --> 1:18:24.060]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[1:18:24.060 --> 1:18:26.060]  But now, more than ever,
[1:18:26.060 --> 1:18:28.060]  you need to get your storable food orders in.
[1:18:28.060 --> 1:18:31.060]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[1:18:31.060 --> 1:18:32.060]  It's high quality.
[1:18:32.060 --> 1:18:35.060]  It's very, very low cost at infowarsstore.com
[1:18:35.060 --> 1:18:37.060]  because in the future, you're going to see
[1:18:37.060 --> 1:18:39.060]  more food supply shortages
[1:18:39.060 --> 1:18:41.060]  and you're going to see food supply price increases
[1:18:41.060 --> 1:18:42.060]  that are already taking place.
[1:18:42.060 --> 1:18:44.060]  So lock in your storable food now
[1:18:44.060 --> 1:18:47.060]  at a lower price and fund the InfoWars
[1:18:47.060 --> 1:18:49.060]  store at infowarsstore.com.
[1:18:49.060 --> 1:18:51.060]  That's how you fight the great reset
[1:18:51.060 --> 1:18:54.060]  is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[1:18:54.060 --> 1:19:18.060]  So get prepared now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:25.060 --> 1:19:27.060]  Probably too strong for some people.
[1:19:27.060 --> 1:19:28.060]  Totally different formula.
[1:19:28.060 --> 1:19:30.060]  Down and out is back in stock.
[1:19:30.060 --> 1:19:31.060]  50% off.
[1:19:31.060 --> 1:19:33.060]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun
[1:19:33.060 --> 1:19:34.060]  and ultra 12, 50% off.
[1:19:34.060 --> 1:19:36.060]  And also on Deep Earth Crystal Iodine
[1:19:36.060 --> 1:19:38.060]  Survival Selects too.
[1:19:38.060 --> 1:19:41.060]  It's all 40, 50% off for one week only.
[1:19:41.060 --> 1:19:43.060]  Take advantage of it and fund the InfoWars.
[1:19:43.060 --> 1:19:45.060]  And I thank you all for your support.
[1:19:45.060 --> 1:19:48.060]  InfoWarsstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three,
[1:19:48.060 --> 1:19:50.060]  three, one, three, nine.
[1:19:50.060 --> 1:19:51.060]  It's a win-win.
[1:19:51.060 --> 1:19:53.060]  These are things that make you healthy,
[1:19:53.060 --> 1:19:55.060]  better, and they fund the InfoWars.
[1:19:55.060 --> 1:20:24.060]  And all we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[1:20:24.060 --> 1:20:27.060]  Great Eric Clapton.
[1:20:27.060 --> 1:20:29.060]  Maybe the best guitar player,
[1:20:29.060 --> 1:20:31.060]  maybe the best slow hand guitar player of all time.
[1:20:31.060 --> 1:20:37.060]  And the COVID vaccine almost destroyed that for the world.
[1:20:37.060 --> 1:20:38.060]  I got to see Eric Clapton.
[1:20:38.060 --> 1:20:40.060]  He came to Austin about a month ago.
[1:20:40.060 --> 1:20:44.060]  And COVID vaccine almost ruined that experience for me.
[1:20:44.060 --> 1:20:46.060]  He said that the COVID vaccine almost made it
[1:20:46.060 --> 1:20:48.060]  that he could never play guitar again.
[1:20:48.060 --> 1:20:50.060]  But luckily he recovered from the vaccine,
[1:20:50.060 --> 1:20:55.060]  which is now a thousand times more deadly than COVID.
[1:20:55.060 --> 1:20:56.060]  That's right.
[1:20:56.060 --> 1:20:59.060]  The name of the Gregory's report at band.video.
[1:20:59.060 --> 1:21:02.060]  The vaccines are 1,000 more deadly than COVID-19.
[1:21:02.060 --> 1:21:11.060]  Here is the latest report from Gregory's.
[1:21:11.060 --> 1:21:15.060]  Many are now awakened to the harsh reality of depopulation
[1:21:15.060 --> 1:21:19.060]  and democide, which we find ourselves in today.
[1:21:19.060 --> 1:21:23.060]  And the end game is out in the open to destroy humanity
[1:21:23.060 --> 1:21:28.060]  under the guise of transhumanism.
[1:21:28.060 --> 1:21:31.060]  What we've unfortunately learned is that there is an overwhelming
[1:21:31.060 --> 1:21:36.060]  herd of us who will do whatever they are told by the system,
[1:21:36.060 --> 1:21:40.060]  which explains how we've gotten this far.
[1:21:40.060 --> 1:21:44.060]  There are seemingly millions who will believe whatever pop culture
[1:21:44.060 --> 1:21:48.060]  tells them, including the mass denial of natural health
[1:21:48.060 --> 1:21:50.060]  and immunity.
[1:21:50.060 --> 1:21:53.060]  While attempting to criminalize a knowledge base
[1:21:53.060 --> 1:21:57.060]  spanning millennia, corporate pop culture prostitutes
[1:21:57.060 --> 1:22:02.060]  spew talking points for Big Pharma's mRNA mystery cocktail
[1:22:02.060 --> 1:22:04.060]  as the only solution.
[1:22:04.060 --> 1:22:06.060]  And if the solution is less people,
[1:22:06.060 --> 1:22:10.060]  which is what the elitists have been saying for decades,
[1:22:10.060 --> 1:22:12.060]  then they are succeeding.
[1:22:12.060 --> 1:22:16.060]  Multiple studies conducted in the UK show that after the vaccine
[1:22:16.060 --> 1:22:21.060]  was introduced, COVID deaths increased by over 1,000%.
[1:22:21.060 --> 1:22:25.060]  And more than half of all COVID deaths and hospitalizations
[1:22:25.060 --> 1:22:28.060]  are from the fully vaccinated.
[1:22:28.060 --> 1:22:33.060]  The numbers in New York City are showing the same.
[1:22:33.060 --> 1:22:37.060]  Experts in the field, including the inventor of the mRNA
[1:22:37.060 --> 1:22:41.060]  tech being used, have been warning of this since the beginning,
[1:22:41.060 --> 1:22:45.060]  but silenced by the corporate media.
[1:22:45.060 --> 1:22:49.060]  Project Veritas has recently exposed how doctors and nurses
[1:22:49.060 --> 1:22:52.060]  are well aware of the dangerous mRNA jabs,
[1:22:52.060 --> 1:22:55.060]  but care more about their own jobs.
[1:22:55.060 --> 1:22:58.060]  And how even low level Big Pharma employees
[1:22:58.060 --> 1:23:01.060]  care only about the numbers.
[1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:05.060]  It is an all out attack against the human race.
[1:23:05.060 --> 1:23:09.060]  We knew this a year ago because we know their white papers,
[1:23:09.060 --> 1:23:12.060]  which is why we know what comes next.
[1:23:12.060 --> 1:23:17.060]  Brought to you by the same characters behind the mRNA vaccines,
[1:23:17.060 --> 1:23:22.060]  what comes next is the end of natural organic humanity
[1:23:22.060 --> 1:23:25.060]  and the beginning of man's own version.
[1:23:25.060 --> 1:23:29.060]  Man fused with machine in a lab.
[1:23:29.060 --> 1:23:30.060]  The end.
[1:23:30.060 --> 1:23:33.060]  There is no more hiding the end game.
[1:23:33.060 --> 1:23:38.060]  It's out in the open where only the unbrainwashed can see it.
[1:23:38.060 --> 1:23:41.060]  Ultimately, it will be up to the people.
[1:23:41.060 --> 1:23:45.060]  The police in Australia are loyally serving their globalist masters.
[1:23:45.060 --> 1:23:49.060]  What makes you think anything will be different in America?
[1:23:49.060 --> 1:23:52.060]  A flight surgeon for the U.S. Army has warned
[1:23:52.060 --> 1:23:56.060]  that all vaccinated pilots are unfit to fly.
[1:23:56.060 --> 1:24:00.060]  The U.S. military is being destroyed from within.
[1:24:00.060 --> 1:24:04.060]  The only way through to freedom is for the people to say no,
[1:24:04.060 --> 1:24:08.060]  which is now starting to happen all across the world.
[1:24:08.060 --> 1:24:12.060]  Humanity uniting together as the human race,
[1:24:12.060 --> 1:24:18.060]  standing up against the most sophisticated tyranny that mankind has ever faced.
[1:24:18.060 --> 1:24:22.060]  All while the pop culture media machine ignores it.
[1:24:22.060 --> 1:24:27.060]  A worldwide peaceful revolution of the people is a numbers game.
[1:24:27.060 --> 1:24:32.060]  So continuing to wake people up is our road to liberation.
[1:24:32.060 --> 1:24:37.060]  Do not remain silent during this dire time at the crossroads of human history.
[1:24:37.060 --> 1:24:41.060]  It is the truth that shall set us free.
[1:24:41.060 --> 1:24:45.060]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[1:24:47.060 --> 1:24:52.060]  And of course, you can find all of the Rees reports at band.video.
[1:24:52.060 --> 1:24:57.060]  And, you know, this is just part of what you have done to support Infowars,
[1:24:57.060 --> 1:25:00.060]  allowing us to hire new people, hire new reporters,
[1:25:00.060 --> 1:25:05.060]  and build the platform of band.video so that we can share this information
[1:25:05.060 --> 1:25:07.060]  with the world.
[1:25:07.060 --> 1:25:10.060]  Let's finish up here with my stack of COVID news,
[1:25:10.060 --> 1:25:12.060]  and we can move on to some of the other developments.
[1:25:12.060 --> 1:25:19.060]  Again, all of the 666 involvement since we've seen COVID
[1:25:19.060 --> 1:25:21.060]  with their patents and their bills and everything.
[1:25:21.060 --> 1:25:23.060]  Here's yet another one.
[1:25:23.060 --> 1:25:28.060]  Democrat slip plans for $700,000 vaccine compliance fines
[1:25:28.060 --> 1:25:33.060]  under U.S. Code section 666 into budget bill.
[1:25:33.060 --> 1:25:41.060]  So they have patents 666 for the biometric currency database.
[1:25:41.060 --> 1:25:45.060]  They have patents 666 for the vaccines.
[1:25:45.060 --> 1:25:52.060]  They've written bills with 666 all about the medical tyranny
[1:25:52.060 --> 1:25:54.060]  management and everything.
[1:25:54.060 --> 1:25:55.060]  It's always 666.
[1:25:55.060 --> 1:26:00.060]  And then there's the weird numerology of COVID tying into 666.
[1:26:00.060 --> 1:26:05.060]  So, yeah, that's pretty wild stuff, but there it is.
[1:26:05.060 --> 1:26:09.060]  Demonstration against COVID-19 vaccine and testing mandate
[1:26:09.060 --> 1:26:13.060]  takes place outside Crystal Lake Elementary District 47 offices.
[1:26:13.060 --> 1:26:18.060]  This is in Illinois, and they put shoes out
[1:26:18.060 --> 1:26:23.060]  because they've now fired people that refuse to get the vaccine.
[1:26:23.060 --> 1:26:27.060]  Teachers, administrators, coaches, and so they went to the school
[1:26:27.060 --> 1:26:32.060]  and they left just their pairs of shoes in front of the building
[1:26:32.060 --> 1:26:33.060]  there.
[1:26:33.060 --> 1:26:37.060]  You can see in this image, looks like it's about 50 pairs or so.
[1:26:37.060 --> 1:26:40.060]  And it is symbolic of all the people that have been fired
[1:26:40.060 --> 1:26:45.060]  because they didn't want to get the experimental injection.
[1:26:45.060 --> 1:26:46.060]  So there you go.
[1:26:46.060 --> 1:26:48.060]  Oh, but they, oh, we care about the little guy.
[1:26:48.060 --> 1:26:50.060]  Everybody's right to work, right?
[1:26:50.060 --> 1:26:53.060]  Oh, no, but you have to follow our tyrannical mandates first.
[1:26:53.060 --> 1:26:54.060]  Then you can be free.
[1:26:54.060 --> 1:26:57.060]  See, that's what freedom's really all about.
[1:26:57.060 --> 1:27:01.060]  New York won't extend unemployment benefits to healthcare workers
[1:27:01.060 --> 1:27:03.060]  fired over COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
[1:27:03.060 --> 1:27:05.060]  So, oh, they want to have a welfare state
[1:27:05.060 --> 1:27:07.060]  for anybody else that doesn't want to work.
[1:27:07.060 --> 1:27:09.060]  They want to have a welfare state for illegal immigrants,
[1:27:09.060 --> 1:27:12.060]  but oh, you fired because you won't take the vaccine?
[1:27:12.060 --> 1:27:14.060]  No, nothing for you.
[1:27:14.060 --> 1:27:18.060]  So Democrats and liberal progressives always pretend to care about you
[1:27:18.060 --> 1:27:23.060]  until they realize that you're not going to be in on their brainwashing
[1:27:23.060 --> 1:27:25.060]  and cult behavior.
[1:27:25.060 --> 1:27:27.060]  Then all of a sudden, they're completely against you.
[1:27:27.060 --> 1:27:28.060]  Pretty simple, really.
[1:27:28.060 --> 1:27:30.060]  Mask up or shut down.
[1:27:30.060 --> 1:27:34.060]  Colorado school given ultimatum over mask mandate.
[1:27:34.060 --> 1:27:36.060]  And it's a Christian school.
[1:27:36.060 --> 1:27:40.060]  They wouldn't do that to any other school but a Christian one.
[1:27:40.060 --> 1:27:44.060]  So a private Christian school in Loveland, Colorado,
[1:27:44.060 --> 1:27:46.060]  is going to have to file a lawsuit.
[1:27:46.060 --> 1:27:50.060]  Resurrection Christian school going to have to file a lawsuit
[1:27:50.060 --> 1:27:52.060]  because the Democrats want to shut the school down
[1:27:52.060 --> 1:27:54.060]  because they don't have a mask mandate.
[1:27:54.060 --> 1:27:55.060]  So much for freedom.
[1:27:55.060 --> 1:27:58.060]  And my body, my choice.
[1:27:58.060 --> 1:28:02.060]  Biotech co-founder says COVID will become manageable,
[1:28:02.060 --> 1:28:05.060]  but the virus will be with us for years.
[1:28:05.060 --> 1:28:06.060]  So, oh, how convenient.
[1:28:06.060 --> 1:28:09.060]  You create a virus in a lab, you release the virus,
[1:28:09.060 --> 1:28:12.060]  and then you use the virus to control the people.
[1:28:12.060 --> 1:28:14.060]  And you just say, yeah, the virus is here forever.
[1:28:14.060 --> 1:28:15.060]  But don't worry.
[1:28:15.060 --> 1:28:19.060]  It's going to be manageable as long as you listen to us.
[1:28:19.060 --> 1:28:22.060]  And because Fauci and Dasek haven't been arrested yet
[1:28:22.060 --> 1:28:25.060]  for their involvement in this creation of a bio weapon,
[1:28:25.060 --> 1:28:27.060]  they were just seen.
[1:28:27.060 --> 1:28:31.060]  Fauci just addressed a Wuhan collaborator conference
[1:28:31.060 --> 1:28:34.060]  alongside Peter Dasek.
[1:28:34.060 --> 1:28:36.060]  And the national pulse has this story.
[1:28:36.060 --> 1:28:40.060]  And so Fauci and Dasek still on the loose.
[1:28:40.060 --> 1:28:41.060]  They made the virus.
[1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:42.060]  They released the virus.
[1:28:42.060 --> 1:28:45.060]  Now they're the tyrants telling you how to deal with the virus,
[1:28:45.060 --> 1:28:47.060]  bringing in medical tyranny worldwide.
[1:28:47.060 --> 1:28:49.060]  And they are still out there.
[1:28:49.060 --> 1:28:51.060]  They need to be criminally investigated.
[1:28:51.060 --> 1:28:56.060]  They need to be called for a congressional hearing immediately.
[1:28:56.060 --> 1:29:00.060]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:29:00.060 --> 1:29:03.060]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth
[1:29:03.060 --> 1:29:06.060]  and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:29:06.060 --> 1:29:07.060]  It hurts.
[1:29:07.060 --> 1:29:08.060]  It stinks.
[1:29:08.060 --> 1:29:09.060]  It's got pus coming out of it.
[1:29:09.060 --> 1:29:10.060]  I go to the doctor.
[1:29:10.060 --> 1:29:11.060]  They fix it.
[1:29:11.060 --> 1:29:12.060]  That's not negative.
[1:29:12.060 --> 1:29:13.060]  I'm not living in denial.
[1:29:13.060 --> 1:29:17.060]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection
[1:29:17.060 --> 1:29:20.060]  that we didn't feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[1:29:20.060 --> 1:29:22.060]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:29:22.060 --> 1:29:24.060]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:29:24.060 --> 1:29:25.060]  They stole the election.
[1:29:25.060 --> 1:29:27.060]  We can't get down about that.
[1:29:27.060 --> 1:29:31.060]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:29:31.060 --> 1:29:33.060]  So now they're trying to suppress us
[1:29:33.060 --> 1:29:35.060]  because they know they've been exposed.
[1:29:35.060 --> 1:29:36.060]  They're scared.
[1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:38.060]  That's why instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers.
[1:29:38.060 --> 1:29:39.060]  Look what happened.
[1:29:39.060 --> 1:29:40.060]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[1:29:40.060 --> 1:29:43.060]  They're trying to suppress us, let our light of truth shine
[1:29:43.060 --> 1:29:46.060]  and tell everybody what's happening, your own website,
[1:29:46.060 --> 1:29:49.060]  your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:29:49.060 --> 1:29:51.060]  Just keep sharing however you can
[1:29:51.060 --> 1:29:53.060]  and realize we're in an information war.
[1:29:53.060 --> 1:29:54.060]  We're going to win this together.
[1:29:54.060 --> 1:30:21.060]  And the fight starts at FullWars.com.
[1:30:25.060 --> 1:30:26.060]  That makes you sleep deep and restful
[1:30:26.060 --> 1:30:28.060]  because that's what helps your immune system.
[1:30:28.060 --> 1:30:31.060]  And I want it to be at least twice as strong as Knockout.
[1:30:31.060 --> 1:30:33.060]  Okay, be careful when you take it.
[1:30:33.060 --> 1:30:34.060]  It's incredibly strong.
[1:30:34.060 --> 1:30:36.060]  It's named Down and Out.
[1:30:36.060 --> 1:30:38.060]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it,
[1:30:38.060 --> 1:30:39.060]  but it is extremely strong.
[1:30:39.060 --> 1:30:41.060]  We are extremely proud of it.
[1:30:41.060 --> 1:30:44.060]  It is exclusively available at FullWars.com.

[1:30:47.060 --> 1:30:48.060]  Sold out for more than four months.

[1:30:53.060 --> 1:30:56.060]  I thank you for your support because it keeps us on the air.
[1:31:23.060 --> 1:31:25.060]  Today we are going to be the supreme ruler
[1:31:25.060 --> 1:31:27.060]  and creator of the universe.
[1:31:27.060 --> 1:31:29.060]  The Samoan people would drink Kava Tea
[1:31:29.060 --> 1:31:31.060]  during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies
[1:31:31.060 --> 1:31:33.060]  to loosen up a little.
[1:31:33.060 --> 1:31:35.060]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world
[1:31:35.060 --> 1:31:38.060]  by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:31:38.060 --> 1:31:40.060]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals
[1:31:40.060 --> 1:31:43.060]  contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[1:31:43.060 --> 1:31:46.060]  but other herbs including but not limited to
[1:31:46.060 --> 1:31:50.060]  German Kamamil, organic Skolkapp, and Balarian root.
[1:31:50.060 --> 1:31:53.060]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly,
[1:31:53.060 --> 1:31:55.060]  so be sure to secure yours by visiting
[1:31:55.060 --> 1:31:58.060]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:31:58.060 --> 1:32:04.060]  Come to Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[1:32:04.060 --> 1:32:09.060]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection
[1:32:09.060 --> 1:32:11.060]  so that you will be safe,
[1:32:11.060 --> 1:32:15.060]  but the injection is not ready yet.
[1:32:15.060 --> 1:32:20.060]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors
[1:32:20.060 --> 1:32:24.060]  for the next 15 days to flatten the camp.
[1:32:24.060 --> 1:32:27.060]  I also need you to wear masks
[1:32:27.060 --> 1:32:32.060]  and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[1:32:32.060 --> 1:32:36.060]  That way we can consolidate control
[1:32:36.060 --> 1:32:38.060]  and bankrupt the world economy,
[1:32:38.060 --> 1:32:43.060]  leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[1:32:43.060 --> 1:32:46.060]  You will then be my slaves.
[1:32:46.060 --> 1:32:49.060]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot
[1:32:49.060 --> 1:32:51.060]  of freedom from Cobra,
[1:32:51.060 --> 1:32:53.060]  who will move your immune system
[1:32:53.060 --> 1:33:16.060]  and you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[1:33:24.060 --> 1:33:29.060]  All right, let me do a news blitz here in this segment.
[1:33:29.060 --> 1:33:32.060]  Again, Jim Hoft joining me from the Gateway Pundit
[1:33:32.060 --> 1:33:34.060]  coming up in about 30 minutes.
[1:33:34.060 --> 1:33:36.060]  I've got other videos to get to as well,
[1:33:36.060 --> 1:33:40.060]  but I want to just try to piledrive through some of this news.
[1:33:40.060 --> 1:33:43.060]  And I just started with this and I know I've already covered it.
[1:33:43.060 --> 1:33:44.060]  It's just so hilarious.
[1:33:44.060 --> 1:33:47.060]  It just shows, I mean, people are just so stupid
[1:33:47.060 --> 1:33:49.060]  that they fall for any of this mainstream media,
[1:33:49.060 --> 1:33:52.060]  big pharmaceutical, medical, tyranny.
[1:33:52.060 --> 1:33:55.060]  Pfizer launches final study for COVID drug
[1:33:55.060 --> 1:33:57.060]  that's similar to horse paste.
[1:33:57.060 --> 1:33:58.060]  So you watch.
[1:33:58.060 --> 1:34:01.060]  So Pfizer's ivermectin will be approved for use.
[1:34:01.060 --> 1:34:04.060]  Pfizer's ivermectin will be approved for use.
[1:34:04.060 --> 1:34:06.060]  It'll be probably like 30 bucks a thing.
[1:34:06.060 --> 1:34:09.060]  When all the other ivermectin is like $7,
[1:34:09.060 --> 1:34:10.060]  they'll charge you 30,
[1:34:10.060 --> 1:34:14.060]  but they'll say, oh, all other ivermectin is horse dewormer,
[1:34:14.060 --> 1:34:18.060]  but Pfizer's ivermectin, that's approved for use.
[1:34:18.060 --> 1:34:19.060]  Yes.
[1:34:19.060 --> 1:34:22.060]  And you watch all the mainstream media lap dogs
[1:34:22.060 --> 1:34:24.060]  and the brainwashed zombies of the planet.
[1:34:24.060 --> 1:34:25.060]  They'll just go right along with it.
[1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:26.060]  They'll say, yes.
[1:34:26.060 --> 1:34:28.060]  Pfizer ivermectin, good.
[1:34:28.060 --> 1:34:31.060]  All other ivermectin, bad.
[1:34:31.060 --> 1:34:33.060]  Pfizer ivermectin for humans.
[1:34:33.060 --> 1:34:36.060]  All other ivermectin for horses.
[1:34:36.060 --> 1:34:38.060]  Can't wait for that to play itself out.
[1:34:38.060 --> 1:34:40.060]  That will be entertaining,
[1:34:40.060 --> 1:34:43.060]  but yet also demeaning as a human.
[1:34:43.060 --> 1:34:45.060]  All right, so this is just hilarious.
[1:34:45.060 --> 1:34:48.060]  So inside of the federal infrastructure bill,
[1:34:48.060 --> 1:34:51.060]  you know, the $3.5 trillion bill that costs $0,
[1:34:51.060 --> 1:34:55.060]  so you have to sign it and pass it so that they can spend it.
[1:34:55.060 --> 1:34:58.060]  Yes, this is the Democrat logic.
[1:34:58.060 --> 1:35:00.060]  $3.5 trillion equals $0.
[1:35:00.060 --> 1:35:01.060]  War is peace.
[1:35:01.060 --> 1:35:03.060]  Slavery is freedom.
[1:35:03.060 --> 1:35:04.060]  Two plus two equals five.
[1:35:04.060 --> 1:35:06.060]  Yes, this is leftism.
[1:35:06.060 --> 1:35:08.060]  This is leftist ideology now.
[1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:17.060]  But inside the bill is a basically carbon footprint tax
[1:35:17.060 --> 1:35:20.060]  targeting the individual that drives a car.
[1:35:20.060 --> 1:35:21.060]  It's in there.
[1:35:21.060 --> 1:35:22.060]  It's undeniable.
[1:35:22.060 --> 1:35:26.060]  So put a fact, though, they can't handle the truth
[1:35:26.060 --> 1:35:30.060]  that, yes, the Democrats have now introduced legislation
[1:35:30.060 --> 1:35:33.060]  to basically tax you by the mile or by the month
[1:35:33.060 --> 1:35:35.060]  basically to try to price you out from driving a car.
[1:35:35.060 --> 1:35:37.060]  So unless you have millions of dollars,
[1:35:37.060 --> 1:35:40.060]  you're not going to be driving a car anymore.
[1:35:40.060 --> 1:35:44.060]  And see, that was what's so great about the car.
[1:35:44.060 --> 1:35:48.060]  And then even nowadays was that most people could afford a car,
[1:35:48.060 --> 1:35:51.060]  afford to drive a car and have that luxury and have that freedom.
[1:35:51.060 --> 1:35:53.060]  Well, the globalists hate that.
[1:35:53.060 --> 1:35:54.060]  They only want that for the rich.
[1:35:54.060 --> 1:35:56.060]  They want you, the peasants, to either walk everywhere,
[1:35:56.060 --> 1:35:58.060]  bike everywhere, take public transit everywhere,
[1:35:58.060 --> 1:36:00.060]  or just sit in a cage all day.
[1:36:00.060 --> 1:36:02.060]  That'd probably be preferable.
[1:36:02.060 --> 1:36:08.060]  So even Politifact has to admit that it's real while denying it.
[1:36:08.060 --> 1:36:11.060]  The Federal Infrastructure Bill includes a pilot program
[1:36:11.060 --> 1:36:14.060]  and a national motor vehicle per mile user fee,
[1:36:14.060 --> 1:36:16.060]  which is basically a long-term plan
[1:36:16.060 --> 1:36:18.060]  to make it too expensive to drive a car.
[1:36:18.060 --> 1:36:20.060]  Politifact says that's mostly false.
[1:36:20.060 --> 1:36:23.060]  What does mostly false even mean?
[1:36:23.060 --> 1:36:27.060]  Well, to transcribe this or translate this from Politifact,
[1:36:27.060 --> 1:36:30.060]  it means it's true.
[1:36:30.060 --> 1:36:31.060]  That's what it means.
[1:36:31.060 --> 1:36:34.060]  It means it's true.
[1:36:34.060 --> 1:36:35.060]  Yes, it's in there.
[1:36:35.060 --> 1:36:36.060]  Yes, it's true.
[1:36:36.060 --> 1:36:40.060]  But we don't want you to know that.
[1:36:40.060 --> 1:36:44.060]  So we just say it's mostly false.
[1:36:44.060 --> 1:36:46.060]  Because most people be upset if they realize the government
[1:36:46.060 --> 1:36:48.060]  is trying to tax them out of driving their car,
[1:36:48.060 --> 1:36:49.060]  and then they'll be even more upset
[1:36:49.060 --> 1:36:51.060]  when they realize it's the Democrats trying to do that.
[1:36:51.060 --> 1:36:54.060]  So we just kind of shuffle that under the rug and say,
[1:36:54.060 --> 1:36:56.060]  nah, it's not really happening.
[1:36:56.060 --> 1:36:58.060]  I mean, it is, but it isn't.
[1:36:58.060 --> 1:37:00.060]  It isn't.
[1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:02.060]  And let's just play that clip real quick, guys,
[1:37:02.060 --> 1:37:05.060]  before I move on here.
[1:37:05.060 --> 1:37:07.060]  Just go ahead and play clip 16.
[1:37:07.060 --> 1:37:12.060]  This is the Republicans telling you what's really going on
[1:37:12.060 --> 1:37:15.060]  with the $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill,
[1:37:15.060 --> 1:37:16.060]  what the Democrats and the liberal media
[1:37:16.060 --> 1:37:18.060]  doesn't want you to know.
[1:37:18.060 --> 1:37:26.060]  This is their bill, 2,500 pages.
[1:37:26.060 --> 1:37:31.060]  If you take a look at $3.5 trillion price tag,
[1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:39.060]  and you do the math, that's $1,400 million for every page
[1:37:39.060 --> 1:37:45.060]  of this bill, and they want to pass it this week.
[1:37:45.060 --> 1:37:48.060]  How many Democrats do you think have read this?
[1:37:48.060 --> 1:37:50.060]  Think Nancy Pelosi's read it?
[1:37:50.060 --> 1:37:52.060]  Think Chuck Schumer's read it?
[1:37:52.060 --> 1:37:55.060]  Do you think Joe Biden, who is desperately begging Democrats
[1:37:55.060 --> 1:37:57.060]  to pass it, do you think he's read it?
[1:37:57.060 --> 1:38:00.060]  Do you think he knows what's in it?
[1:38:00.060 --> 1:38:02.060]  No, I was told it equals $0.
[1:38:02.060 --> 1:38:04.060]  Biden said it $0.
[1:38:04.060 --> 1:38:05.060]  Socky said it $0.
[1:38:05.060 --> 1:38:06.060]  Pelosi said it $0.
[1:38:06.060 --> 1:38:07.060]  So what are we signing?
[1:38:07.060 --> 1:38:08.060]  What's the big deal?
[1:38:08.060 --> 1:38:10.060]  If it's $0, what are we doing here?
[1:38:10.060 --> 1:38:11.060]  It's not $0.
[1:38:11.060 --> 1:38:12.060]  It's $3.5 trillion.
[1:38:12.060 --> 1:38:14.060]  The Democrats and the media are lying to you
[1:38:14.060 --> 1:38:18.060]  because they're liars.
[1:38:18.060 --> 1:38:21.060]  Let's move on.
[1:38:21.060 --> 1:38:27.060]  Speaking of liars, so another story came out.
[1:38:27.060 --> 1:38:29.060]  It was at a high school in St. Louis,
[1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:32.060]  and maybe I'll talk about this with Jim Hoff coming up.
[1:38:32.060 --> 1:38:34.060]  The Gateway Point had this story.
[1:38:34.060 --> 1:38:36.060]  An individual went into the bathroom
[1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:43.060]  and spray painted racial epitaphs in the bathroom.
[1:38:43.060 --> 1:38:45.060]  So it became a big thing.
[1:38:45.060 --> 1:38:48.060]  All the politicians in St. Louis came out to that school
[1:38:48.060 --> 1:38:50.060]  and they had multiple walkouts and rallies
[1:38:50.060 --> 1:38:53.060]  and politicians and media used it to make a statement
[1:38:53.060 --> 1:38:55.060]  saying, see how racist America is, all this stuff.
[1:38:55.060 --> 1:38:59.060]  Well, after all the hubba-blub and everything
[1:38:59.060 --> 1:39:03.060]  and the walkouts and the protests and then, oh, guess what?
[1:39:03.060 --> 1:39:08.060]  They came to find out it was a black student that did it.
[1:39:08.060 --> 1:39:11.060]  It was a leftist liberal that did it, faked racism.
[1:39:11.060 --> 1:39:14.060]  Because, you know, the Democrats are so desperate for racism
[1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:17.060]  to be everywhere that they have to fake it.
[1:39:17.060 --> 1:39:18.060]  They have to do it.
[1:39:18.060 --> 1:39:19.060]  So they're the racists.
[1:39:19.060 --> 1:39:20.060]  They commit the hate crimes.
[1:39:20.060 --> 1:39:25.060]  They fake the hate crimes like spraying racial images
[1:39:25.060 --> 1:39:26.060]  and words on the bathrooms.
[1:39:26.060 --> 1:39:28.060]  By the way, they've been caught doing this dozens of times now.
[1:39:28.060 --> 1:39:29.060]  It's every damn time.
[1:39:29.060 --> 1:39:31.060]  It's Jesse Smallette 2.0.
[1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:33.060]  Just copycat, Jesse Smallettes.
[1:39:33.060 --> 1:39:35.060]  So the Democrats are so desperate,
[1:39:35.060 --> 1:39:37.060]  liberals are so desperate for America to be racist,
[1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:38.060]  they have to hate it.
[1:39:38.060 --> 1:39:41.060]  So when I see these two stories,
[1:39:41.060 --> 1:39:46.060]  I immediately am drawn to this is another fake one.
[1:39:46.060 --> 1:39:50.060]  Vile Nazi graffiti appears at primary schools
[1:39:50.060 --> 1:39:53.060]  as vandals paint red swastika on the wall.
[1:39:53.060 --> 1:39:55.060]  If they do it, if they ever find out who did this,
[1:39:55.060 --> 1:39:57.060]  they'll find out it was a liberal leftist.
[1:39:57.060 --> 1:39:59.060]  Guarantee it.
[1:39:59.060 --> 1:40:01.060]  Guarantee it.
[1:40:01.060 --> 1:40:05.060]  And then here's another one.
[1:40:05.060 --> 1:40:09.060]  Security camera captures vandal tossing an incendiary device
[1:40:09.060 --> 1:40:13.060]  into Democrat Party offices in Austin.
[1:40:13.060 --> 1:40:17.060]  And this occurred this morning at about 2 a.m.
[1:40:17.060 --> 1:40:20.060]  Now, guys, if you could please pull up this story
[1:40:20.060 --> 1:40:22.060]  because I don't have the image on my document here,
[1:40:22.060 --> 1:40:24.060]  but pull it up because I want you to see the image.
[1:40:24.060 --> 1:40:28.060]  So I'm going to go ahead.
[1:40:28.060 --> 1:40:30.060]  I hope they do a full investigation into this
[1:40:30.060 --> 1:40:33.060]  and I hope that they find out the perpetrator of this.
[1:40:33.060 --> 1:40:36.060]  And see, this used to be maybe going out on a limb
[1:40:36.060 --> 1:40:38.060]  to say something like this.
[1:40:38.060 --> 1:40:41.060]  Now it's a very sturdy limb if it's even considered a limb.
[1:40:41.060 --> 1:40:44.060]  It's basically a tree trunk of confidence at this point.
[1:40:44.060 --> 1:40:46.060]  If and when they find out this individual,
[1:40:46.060 --> 1:40:48.060]  I guarantee you he ends up being a Democrat,
[1:40:48.060 --> 1:40:51.060]  he may even work at the very facility.
[1:40:51.060 --> 1:40:54.060]  Because here's the thing.
[1:40:54.060 --> 1:40:56.060]  The guy shows up.
[1:40:56.060 --> 1:41:01.060]  They obviously know there's a security camera at their facility.
[1:41:01.060 --> 1:41:05.060]  So the guy shows up with an American flag bandana
[1:41:05.060 --> 1:41:08.060]  and an American flag mask
[1:41:08.060 --> 1:41:12.060]  and throws a Molotov cocktail into the Democrat Party headquarters
[1:41:12.060 --> 1:41:15.060]  in Austin, Texas.
[1:41:15.060 --> 1:41:20.060]  Now, do you really think a genuine vandal,
[1:41:20.060 --> 1:41:22.060]  which by the way, you don't have any history
[1:41:22.060 --> 1:41:24.060]  of Republicans committing violent crimes like this,
[1:41:24.060 --> 1:41:25.060]  political crimes like this.
[1:41:25.060 --> 1:41:27.060]  It just, it doesn't exist.
[1:41:27.060 --> 1:41:31.060]  That's why they had to fake the ones that they do.
[1:41:31.060 --> 1:41:33.060]  But can you imagine somebody's like,
[1:41:33.060 --> 1:41:38.060]  oh, I'm going to show up in an American flag face mask and bandana
[1:41:38.060 --> 1:41:40.060]  right in front of a security camera
[1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:43.060]  and throw one Molotov cocktail into the Democrat Party offices.
[1:41:43.060 --> 1:41:46.060]  That'll show them, that'll teach them.
[1:41:46.060 --> 1:41:48.060]  Or could you imagine a Democrat saying,
[1:41:48.060 --> 1:41:51.060]  I need to fake a hate crime against us
[1:41:51.060 --> 1:41:53.060]  to make us look like we're victims
[1:41:53.060 --> 1:41:55.060]  and to show how bad Republicans are.
[1:41:55.060 --> 1:41:58.060]  And I know we've got a camera in front of our offices.
[1:41:58.060 --> 1:42:00.060]  So I'm going to show up late this night
[1:42:00.060 --> 1:42:03.060]  and I'm going to have an American mask, American flag mask
[1:42:03.060 --> 1:42:06.060]  and bandana on so that they think it's a Republican.
[1:42:06.060 --> 1:42:08.060]  Because, you know, we hate the American flag
[1:42:08.060 --> 1:42:09.060]  and they like America.
[1:42:09.060 --> 1:42:11.060]  So I'll wear American flag apparel.
[1:42:11.060 --> 1:42:13.060]  That way they'll think I'm a Republican.
[1:42:13.060 --> 1:42:15.060]  And it'll all be on camera too,
[1:42:15.060 --> 1:42:16.060]  because I know we have a security camera
[1:42:16.060 --> 1:42:18.060]  right in front of our office.
[1:42:18.060 --> 1:42:25.060]  So I hope if and when they find this individual,
[1:42:25.060 --> 1:42:26.060]  we get the full story here.
[1:42:26.060 --> 1:42:28.060]  And I would bet you,
[1:42:28.060 --> 1:42:30.060]  it's a liberal Democrat that did it,
[1:42:30.060 --> 1:42:32.060]  a hate crime against themselves
[1:42:32.060 --> 1:42:35.060]  for the media coverage and to pose as victims,
[1:42:35.060 --> 1:42:37.060]  because that's what they do best.
[1:42:37.060 --> 1:42:39.060]  They've been caught doing it dozens of times,
[1:42:39.060 --> 1:42:42.060]  from justy small let to colleges,
[1:42:42.060 --> 1:42:45.060]  to high schools, to Democrat Party offices.
[1:42:45.060 --> 1:42:46.060]  It's always the Democrats.
[1:42:46.060 --> 1:42:47.060]  It's always the left.
[1:42:47.060 --> 1:42:48.060]  They do this to themselves.
[1:42:48.060 --> 1:42:50.060]  So I hope they find this individual.
[1:42:50.060 --> 1:42:52.060]  I hope they find him.
[1:42:52.060 --> 1:42:54.060]  And we'll see what the real story here is,
[1:42:54.060 --> 1:42:57.060]  but I think we all know, don't we?
[1:42:57.060 --> 1:43:01.060]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart,
[1:43:01.060 --> 1:43:02.060]  deep in my soul.
[1:43:02.060 --> 1:43:05.060]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet,
[1:43:05.060 --> 1:43:08.060]  I've had a lot of loss, like everybody else has.
[1:43:08.060 --> 1:43:15.060]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom
[1:43:15.060 --> 1:43:18.060]  that so many people fought and died
[1:43:18.060 --> 1:43:21.060]  and bled and sweat for.
[1:43:21.060 --> 1:43:25.060]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[1:43:25.060 --> 1:43:28.060]  And I see the general public in a medically induced,
[1:43:28.060 --> 1:43:32.060]  scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled,
[1:43:32.060 --> 1:43:34.060]  transient.
[1:43:34.060 --> 1:43:37.060]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder,
[1:43:37.060 --> 1:43:38.060]  and it's so incredibly sad.
[1:43:38.060 --> 1:43:43.060]  But this is the process of birth and then growth
[1:43:43.060 --> 1:43:46.060]  and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing
[1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:49.060]  and then coming back to life again.
[1:43:49.060 --> 1:43:52.060]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control
[1:43:52.060 --> 1:43:54.060]  this process of decadence and collapse.
[1:43:54.060 --> 1:43:56.060]  To actually end the species as we know it.
[1:44:24.060 --> 1:44:26.060]  Probably too strong for some people.
[1:44:26.060 --> 1:44:27.060]  Totally different formula.
[1:44:27.060 --> 1:44:30.060]  Down and out is back at stock 50% off.
[1:44:30.060 --> 1:44:32.060]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12,
[1:44:32.060 --> 1:44:35.060]  50% off, and also on Deep Earth Crystal iodine,
[1:44:35.060 --> 1:44:37.060]  Survival Selects too.
[1:44:37.060 --> 1:44:40.060]  It's all 40 and 50% off for one week only.
[1:44:40.060 --> 1:44:42.060]  Take advantage of it and find the info war.
[1:44:42.060 --> 1:44:44.060]  And I thank you all for your support.
[1:44:44.060 --> 1:44:48.060]  Infowarsstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one,
[1:44:48.060 --> 1:44:49.060]  three, nine.
[1:44:49.060 --> 1:44:50.060]  It's a win-win.
[1:44:50.060 --> 1:44:52.060]  These are things that make you healthy,
[1:44:52.060 --> 1:44:53.060]  make your life better,
[1:44:53.060 --> 1:44:57.060]  and the info war again, all we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[1:44:57.060 --> 1:45:01.060]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years
[1:45:01.060 --> 1:45:03.060]  against the globalist.
[1:45:03.060 --> 1:45:05.060]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:45:05.060 --> 1:45:08.060]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:45:08.060 --> 1:45:10.060]  before they went operational.
[1:45:10.060 --> 1:45:11.060]  But we failed.
[1:45:11.060 --> 1:45:13.060]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:45:13.060 --> 1:45:15.060]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[1:45:15.060 --> 1:45:18.060]  but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:45:18.060 --> 1:45:21.060]  deindustrialization, great reset.
[1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:23.060]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[1:45:23.060 --> 1:45:27.060]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[1:45:27.060 --> 1:45:30.060]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:45:30.060 --> 1:45:32.060]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[1:45:32.060 --> 1:45:33.060]  and trying to stop their agenda.
[1:45:33.060 --> 1:45:35.060]  And we've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:45:35.060 --> 1:45:37.060]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality,
[1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:38.060]  storeable food.
[1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:41.060]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices
[1:45:41.060 --> 1:45:43.060]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:43.060 --> 1:45:45.060]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply
[1:45:45.060 --> 1:45:48.060]  or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[1:45:48.060 --> 1:45:51.060]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[1:45:51.060 --> 1:45:53.060]  and before there are long lines and waits.
[1:45:53.060 --> 1:45:55.060]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:58.060]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:58.060 --> 1:46:01.060]  So the placebo that they have used,
[1:46:01.060 --> 1:46:03.060]  that the FDA has allowed them to use,
[1:46:03.060 --> 1:46:06.060]  has often been another vaccine.
[1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:09.060]  A vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile
[1:46:09.060 --> 1:46:12.060]  that's causing death and damage in its own right.
[1:46:12.060 --> 1:46:17.060]  That it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the vaccine,
[1:46:17.060 --> 1:46:20.060]  a known neurotoxin, a known immunotoxin,
[1:46:20.060 --> 1:46:22.060]  a known poison in human beings
[1:46:22.060 --> 1:46:25.060]  that is in the supposedly inert placebo.
[1:46:25.060 --> 1:46:26.060]  Totally inappropriate.
[1:46:26.060 --> 1:46:28.060]  This is not good science.
[1:46:28.060 --> 1:46:30.060]  It is not science at all.
[1:46:30.060 --> 1:46:34.060]  It is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rates
[1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:37.060]  to these vaccines so that they can get through
[1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:41.060]  the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA
[1:46:41.060 --> 1:46:43.060]  and onto the market.
[1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:44.060]  That is the only concern.
[1:46:44.060 --> 1:46:47.060]  Dr. Wakefield is just one of many informed voices
[1:46:47.060 --> 1:46:48.060]  in the film, COVIDland.

[1:47:16.060 --> 1:47:18.060]  Back here on the Alex Jones show,
[1:47:18.060 --> 1:47:22.060]  Owens Royer sitting in for Alex.
[1:47:22.060 --> 1:47:25.060]  He's busy on the road right now, but he's going to be back.
[1:47:25.060 --> 1:47:29.060]  He may even guest host the War Room today
[1:47:29.060 --> 1:47:31.060]  or be popping in on the War Room
[1:47:31.060 --> 1:47:35.060]  as I'm filling in duties here on the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:35.060 --> 1:47:39.060]  But we do have Jim Hoft coming up from the Gateway Pundit
[1:47:39.060 --> 1:47:40.060]  with some breaking news.
[1:47:40.060 --> 1:47:41.060]  He'll be joining us shortly.
[1:47:41.060 --> 1:47:44.060]  Let me just delve back into the other news
[1:47:44.060 --> 1:47:45.060]  that I have here on my desk.
[1:47:45.060 --> 1:47:48.060]  See if we can't clear it out before Jim joins me.
[1:47:48.060 --> 1:47:57.060]  YouTube's CEO says free speech is a core value.
[1:47:57.060 --> 1:47:59.060]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:47:59.060 --> 1:48:02.060]  free speech is a core value of YouTube,
[1:48:02.060 --> 1:48:05.060]  and my head is bald.
[1:48:05.060 --> 1:48:08.060]  I have a bald head.
[1:48:08.060 --> 1:48:14.060]  The studio lights are gleaming off of my bald head right now,
[1:48:14.060 --> 1:48:19.060]  and YouTube has free speech as a core value.
[1:48:19.060 --> 1:48:24.060]  Russia threatens to block YouTube for deleting RT channels.
[1:48:24.060 --> 1:48:26.060]  I thought YouTube believed in free speech.
[1:48:26.060 --> 1:48:27.060]  Oh, no, they don't.
[1:48:27.060 --> 1:48:28.060]  They're censoring free speech.
[1:48:28.060 --> 1:48:29.060]  That's right.
[1:48:29.060 --> 1:48:32.060]  They believe in global government tyranny,
[1:48:32.060 --> 1:48:34.060]  which means censoring free speech
[1:48:34.060 --> 1:48:36.060]  if you're against the global government.
[1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:38.060]  YouTube just can't stop lying.
[1:48:38.060 --> 1:48:40.060]  I forget the name of the author of this story.
[1:48:40.060 --> 1:48:42.060]  I don't know why it didn't print out.
[1:48:42.060 --> 1:48:44.060]  It's at brownstone.org.
[1:48:44.060 --> 1:48:46.060]  The purges have begun,
[1:48:46.060 --> 1:48:48.060]  and this is really just kind of a logical centrist
[1:48:48.060 --> 1:48:51.060]  who said that this is the most important work he's ever done.
[1:48:51.060 --> 1:48:52.060]  He's been around for a long time.
[1:48:52.060 --> 1:48:53.060]  I'm going to forget the name of the author,
[1:48:53.060 --> 1:48:57.060]  but it gets into how the political persecutions have begun
[1:48:57.060 --> 1:48:59.060]  at all levels of our society,
[1:48:59.060 --> 1:49:02.060]  government, schools, the military, everything,
[1:49:02.060 --> 1:49:04.060]  and how dangerous it is and where it leads.
[1:49:04.060 --> 1:49:08.060]  So most people are starting to figure this out now,
[1:49:08.060 --> 1:49:11.060]  but it's time to be honest about who's doing it
[1:49:11.060 --> 1:49:13.060]  and how we can stop it.
[1:49:13.060 --> 1:49:14.060]  It's the left doing it.
[1:49:14.060 --> 1:49:16.060]  It's the Democrats doing it.
[1:49:16.060 --> 1:49:19.060]  It's liberal progressive Democrats on the left
[1:49:19.060 --> 1:49:22.060]  that are purging opposition to them.
[1:49:22.060 --> 1:49:24.060]  They're the tyrants.
[1:49:24.060 --> 1:49:26.060]  They're the Nazis.
[1:49:26.060 --> 1:49:31.060]  And so even though in the story it gets into that,
[1:49:31.060 --> 1:49:37.060]  it doesn't put the onus on the actual political parties responsible for it
[1:49:37.060 --> 1:49:40.060]  because people don't want to leap that shark yet.
[1:49:40.060 --> 1:49:42.060]  Until you face the reality of who's doing this to us,
[1:49:42.060 --> 1:49:45.060]  you're not going to defeat it.
[1:49:45.060 --> 1:49:47.060]  This is what he's talking about, by the way.
[1:49:47.060 --> 1:49:51.060]  Professor removed after refusal to grade black students on a curve
[1:49:51.060 --> 1:49:53.060]  sues UCLA.
[1:49:53.060 --> 1:49:56.060]  So what they wanted to do at UCLA or what they do, actually,
[1:49:56.060 --> 1:49:58.060]  and what they're doing at schools across America,
[1:49:58.060 --> 1:50:02.060]  if a black student gets a C, that's a B.
[1:50:02.060 --> 1:50:05.060]  If a white student gets a C, that's a C.
[1:50:05.060 --> 1:50:08.060]  If a black student gets a C, that's a B or even an A.
[1:50:08.060 --> 1:50:10.060]  So the UCLA professor says, I'm not doing this.
[1:50:10.060 --> 1:50:12.060]  This is discrimination.
[1:50:12.060 --> 1:50:14.060]  I'm not grading people on a racial curve.
[1:50:14.060 --> 1:50:17.060]  So UCLA fired him.
[1:50:17.060 --> 1:50:21.060]  How dare you not be racist, says UCLA.
[1:50:21.060 --> 1:50:25.060]  Here's more of the great purge that the left is currently involved in.
[1:50:25.060 --> 1:50:30.060]  Marine who saved baby from Kabul airport under investigation
[1:50:30.060 --> 1:50:32.060]  after appearing at Trump rally.
[1:50:32.060 --> 1:50:36.060]  Oh, you showed up at a Trump rally?
[1:50:36.060 --> 1:50:41.060]  We're going to investigate you because you don't have free speech.
[1:50:41.060 --> 1:50:43.060]  Exclusive.
[1:50:43.060 --> 1:50:45.060]  Daily caller.
[1:50:45.060 --> 1:50:48.060]  Jailed Marine who demanded accountability for Afghanistan
[1:50:48.060 --> 1:50:53.060]  offered to resign honorably but rejected so they could throw him in jail.
[1:50:53.060 --> 1:50:56.060]  And so Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Scheller sits in jail right now,
[1:50:56.060 --> 1:50:58.060]  another political prisoner of the Democrat Party.
[1:50:58.060 --> 1:50:59.060]  Why?
[1:50:59.060 --> 1:51:03.060]  Because he called out the Biden administration's failings and lies about Afghanistan.
[1:51:03.060 --> 1:51:06.060]  So, oh, this member of the military spoke in a Trump rally.
[1:51:06.060 --> 1:51:08.060]  We're going to investigate you.
[1:51:08.060 --> 1:51:12.060]  Oh, this member of the military spoke out against crimes he saw committed
[1:51:12.060 --> 1:51:15.060]  and lies committed by the military and by our White House leadership.
[1:51:15.060 --> 1:51:17.060]  We're going to throw you in a jail.
[1:51:17.060 --> 1:51:19.060]  But I'll resign with a dishonorable discharge.
[1:51:19.060 --> 1:51:21.060]  No, we're going to keep you there.
[1:51:21.060 --> 1:51:24.060]  And you know what, we're going to just go and throw you in jail
[1:51:24.060 --> 1:51:25.060]  because that's what we do.
[1:51:25.060 --> 1:51:26.060]  We're the Democrats.
[1:51:26.060 --> 1:51:27.060]  We have political parties.
[1:51:27.060 --> 1:51:30.060]  And by the way, political prisoners, excuse me.
[1:51:30.060 --> 1:51:32.060]  And by the way, I'm going to tell you what they're about to do next.
[1:51:32.060 --> 1:51:37.060]  I don't know what the deal is with the Taliban and Joe Biden.
[1:51:37.060 --> 1:51:40.060]  I don't know if they have blackmail on Biden or blackmail on Obama
[1:51:40.060 --> 1:51:44.060]  or why the Taliban is basically running the White House foreign policy in Afghanistan.
[1:51:44.060 --> 1:51:46.060]  I mean, literally it treats that point.
[1:51:46.060 --> 1:51:49.060]  And so what you're going to see happen next,
[1:51:49.060 --> 1:51:52.060]  remember, I guess it was Tuesday,
[1:51:52.060 --> 1:51:59.060]  a private contractor rescued dozens of Americans
[1:51:59.060 --> 1:52:02.060]  and overall more than 100 people,
[1:52:02.060 --> 1:52:04.060]  but dozens of Americans and dozens of green-called holders
[1:52:04.060 --> 1:52:06.060]  that were trapped in Afghanistan,
[1:52:06.060 --> 1:52:07.060]  yeah, the Biden administration lied.
[1:52:07.060 --> 1:52:09.060]  There were still Americans over there trapped.
[1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:11.060]  There were still allies of ours over there trapped.
[1:52:11.060 --> 1:52:13.060]  The Biden administration lied about that.
[1:52:13.060 --> 1:52:16.060]  So a private contractor flew a plane over there,
[1:52:16.060 --> 1:52:19.060]  rescued them and tried to get entry back into the U.S.
[1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:22.060]  and was denied entry.
[1:52:22.060 --> 1:52:24.060]  Now, I guess they should have landed at the southern border
[1:52:24.060 --> 1:52:25.060]  and crossed the Rio Grande
[1:52:25.060 --> 1:52:27.060]  and then they could have been let in and had free handouts.
[1:52:27.060 --> 1:52:29.060]  But if you try to fly in legitimately as an American,
[1:52:29.060 --> 1:52:31.060]  you're not allowed to do that, see?
[1:52:31.060 --> 1:52:33.060]  So here's what's going to come next.
[1:52:33.060 --> 1:52:35.060]  And you're going to start hearing about this before the weekend
[1:52:35.060 --> 1:52:38.060]  and then probably next week it may be actual policy.
[1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:43.060]  The Taliban runs the Biden administration's Afghanistan policy
[1:52:43.060 --> 1:52:46.060]  and they're going to start treating anybody
[1:52:46.060 --> 1:52:50.060]  who's either trying to rescue Americans over there
[1:52:50.060 --> 1:52:53.060]  or trying to send money to Americans over there
[1:52:53.060 --> 1:52:56.060]  because they may need help or food or who knows what.
[1:52:56.060 --> 1:53:00.060]  And if you do that, it's going to be considered a crime.
[1:53:00.060 --> 1:53:05.060]  I bet you by the end of October.
[1:53:05.060 --> 1:53:08.060]  So again, you're going to see this coming
[1:53:08.060 --> 1:53:10.060]  and you're not going to believe it
[1:53:10.060 --> 1:53:12.060]  and it's not going to make any sense.
[1:53:12.060 --> 1:53:15.060]  And I don't know, it doesn't make any sense to me
[1:53:15.060 --> 1:53:17.060]  unless the Taliban,
[1:53:17.060 --> 1:53:20.060]  I don't know how the Taliban have so much leverage over Joe Biden
[1:53:20.060 --> 1:53:24.060]  but they're running the entire U.S. foreign policy in Afghanistan.
[1:53:24.060 --> 1:53:26.060]  They're running the Biden White House now.
[1:53:26.060 --> 1:53:29.060]  And they don't like Americans rescuing Americans
[1:53:29.060 --> 1:53:33.060]  and Afghanistan green card holders from Afghanistan.
[1:53:33.060 --> 1:53:35.060]  So they told Biden not to let them in.
[1:53:35.060 --> 1:53:36.060]  So they didn't.
[1:53:36.060 --> 1:53:38.060]  And next it's going to be,
[1:53:38.060 --> 1:53:42.060]  oh, we're seeing people sending money to loved ones in Afghanistan
[1:53:42.060 --> 1:53:44.060]  or churches in Afghanistan.
[1:53:44.060 --> 1:53:46.060]  We want that to be treated like a crime.
[1:53:46.060 --> 1:53:50.060]  And you watch, the Biden administration will give the Taliban that next.
[1:53:50.060 --> 1:53:52.060]  Wow.
[1:53:52.060 --> 1:53:55.060]  The Biden administration gave the Taliban an entire military arsenal,
[1:53:55.060 --> 1:53:58.060]  hundreds of millions of dollars,
[1:53:58.060 --> 1:54:01.060]  an entire country.
[1:54:01.060 --> 1:54:02.060]  What else am I missing?
[1:54:02.060 --> 1:54:04.060]  Oh, hostages.
[1:54:04.060 --> 1:54:08.060]  Hostages too.
[1:54:08.060 --> 1:54:14.060]  Just unbelievable stuff.
[1:54:14.060 --> 1:54:16.060]  Unbelievable stuff.
[1:54:16.060 --> 1:54:18.060]  So the Taliban runs the Biden White House.
[1:54:18.060 --> 1:54:21.060]  So we know that Russia has blackmail on the Bidens.
[1:54:21.060 --> 1:54:24.060]  We know Uzbekistan has blackmail on the Bidens.
[1:54:24.060 --> 1:54:26.060]  Does the Taliban too?
[1:54:26.060 --> 1:54:28.060]  Or are they blackmailing Obama?
[1:54:28.060 --> 1:54:30.060]  Or how is all of this going on?
[1:54:30.060 --> 1:54:31.060]  But you watch.
[1:54:31.060 --> 1:54:34.060]  I would guess that in the month of October,
[1:54:34.060 --> 1:54:36.060]  they come out with new mandates.
[1:54:36.060 --> 1:54:41.060]  No American is allowed to try to rescue Americans from Afghanistan.
[1:54:41.060 --> 1:54:46.060]  And no American is allowed to send money to Afghanistan.
[1:54:46.060 --> 1:54:49.060]  Yes, see, the Taliban warns Joe Biden.
[1:54:49.060 --> 1:54:51.060]  They are running the show, folks.
[1:54:51.060 --> 1:54:54.060]  They are running the show.
[1:54:54.060 --> 1:54:55.060]  Why?
[1:54:55.060 --> 1:54:57.060]  Your guess is as good as mine.
[1:54:57.060 --> 1:54:59.060]  I've laid out what I think may be going on.
[1:54:59.060 --> 1:55:01.060]  Moving on.
[1:55:01.060 --> 1:55:07.060]  Governor Abbott announces intention to appeal FEMA denial of federal emergency declaration
[1:55:07.060 --> 1:55:09.060]  in response to border crisis.
[1:55:09.060 --> 1:55:13.060]  And they just released, this is a press release that just came out yesterday.
[1:55:13.060 --> 1:55:19.060]  So basically, Greg Abbott declared a federal emergency because of the illegal immigrant invasion
[1:55:19.060 --> 1:55:21.060]  at the southern border in Texas.
[1:55:21.060 --> 1:55:23.060]  And he wanted help from FEMA.
[1:55:23.060 --> 1:55:26.060]  And FEMA said, nope, we reject that.
[1:55:26.060 --> 1:55:32.060]  And now they're trying to deny all federal emergency money from Texas because of Governor Abbott
[1:55:32.060 --> 1:55:34.060]  and he's fighting back against it.
[1:55:34.060 --> 1:55:37.060]  So the Democrats create an emergency at the southern border.
[1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:40.060]  You try to do something about it and then they make it illegal.
[1:55:40.060 --> 1:55:43.060]  The Democrats create an emergency in Afghanistan.
[1:55:43.060 --> 1:55:47.060]  You try to do something about it and then they make it illegal.
[1:55:47.060 --> 1:55:50.060]  And the war on the Border Patrol continues out of the White House.
[1:55:50.060 --> 1:55:56.060]  Border Patrol agents must be vaccinated by November or face being fired.
[1:55:56.060 --> 1:56:00.060]  So tack it to the list of the things that Joe Biden has declared war on.
[1:56:00.060 --> 1:56:06.060]  Teachers, the military, Border Patrol, police officers, pretty much every U.S. citizen.
[1:56:06.060 --> 1:56:11.060]  And I guess innocent women at baseball games too, Joe Biden creeps on unsuspecting woman
[1:56:11.060 --> 1:56:18.060]  at congressional baseball game and then boxes her in and then boxes her in.
[1:56:18.060 --> 1:56:21.060]  Seriously, this guy is such a creep.
[1:56:21.060 --> 1:56:24.060]  This guy is just such a creep.
[1:56:24.060 --> 1:56:25.060]  Unbelievable.
[1:56:25.060 --> 1:56:27.060]  All right, so this is a funny one.
[1:56:27.060 --> 1:56:32.060]  Kamala Harris hires crisis experts to repair her long-term planning outlook.
[1:56:32.060 --> 1:56:35.060]  So here's what's happening, folks.
[1:56:35.060 --> 1:56:39.060]  Kamala Harris hired a team of crisis experts.
[1:56:39.060 --> 1:56:46.060]  Basically, CEOs and other people hire these firms to fix their public image
[1:56:46.060 --> 1:56:49.060]  when they have a bad public image or they have some story come out that's bad.
[1:56:49.060 --> 1:56:52.060]  They hire these firms to fix their public image.
[1:56:52.060 --> 1:56:54.060]  Kamala Harris has hired these firms.
[1:56:54.060 --> 1:56:59.060]  So she knows she's completely disliked by the American people.
[1:56:59.060 --> 1:57:00.060]  Everybody knows she's a phony.
[1:57:00.060 --> 1:57:02.060]  She has almost no support.
[1:57:02.060 --> 1:57:04.060]  She's nowhere to be found.
[1:57:04.060 --> 1:57:09.060]  And so she's hired crisis experts to repair her public image now.
[1:57:09.060 --> 1:57:12.060]  Now, I don't know if this is a sign that maybe she's getting ready to take over the White House
[1:57:12.060 --> 1:57:15.060]  or something else, but it is a sign that she knows she's unpopular.
[1:57:15.060 --> 1:57:17.060]  She knows she's disliked.
[1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:18.060]  Everybody knows she's a phony.
[1:57:18.060 --> 1:57:21.060]  So now she's going to try to fake being somebody else.
[1:57:21.060 --> 1:57:23.060]  Don't you love it?
[1:57:23.060 --> 1:57:25.060]  So we don't like her because she's a complete phony.
[1:57:25.060 --> 1:57:31.060]  So now she hires a team of experts to teach her how to be something else, phony.
[1:57:31.060 --> 1:57:33.060]  Hey, Kamala, here's a wild idea.
[1:57:33.060 --> 1:57:35.060]  Why don't you just be yourself?
[1:57:35.060 --> 1:57:41.060]  Or maybe that already took its toll when you were working for Willie Brown to get involved in politics.
[1:57:41.060 --> 1:57:42.060]  I guess maybe that's yourself.
[1:57:42.060 --> 1:57:47.060]  So now she has to fake being somebody else to repair her public image.
[1:57:47.060 --> 1:57:52.060]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[1:57:52.060 --> 1:57:56.060]  When we look at the world system now openly announcing the Mark of the Beast,
[1:57:56.060 --> 1:58:01.060]  everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will
[1:58:01.060 --> 1:58:06.060]  and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity,
[1:58:06.060 --> 1:58:12.060]  our very genetics, our very future over to them.
[1:58:12.060 --> 1:58:14.060]  They want control of procreation.
[1:58:14.060 --> 1:58:17.060]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[1:58:17.060 --> 1:58:22.060]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[1:58:22.060 --> 1:58:28.060]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will.
[1:58:28.060 --> 1:58:33.060]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time
[1:58:33.060 --> 1:58:38.060]  so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[1:58:38.060 --> 1:58:47.060]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:49.060]  My business model is very, very simple.
[1:58:49.060 --> 1:58:53.060]  I want to bring you products that work really, really well
[1:58:53.060 --> 1:58:57.060]  at affordable prices that are competitive so that you'll shop with us
[1:58:57.060 --> 1:59:02.060]  and so we form a relationship so we're able to stay on air and fight the globalist
[1:59:02.060 --> 1:59:07.060]  and have good products that make us healthy, make us wiser, that boost our immune system.
[1:59:07.060 --> 1:59:08.060]  And that's what we've done.
[1:59:08.060 --> 1:59:12.060]  Now, one area of the immune system we don't talk enough about is deep, restful sleep.
[1:59:12.060 --> 1:59:13.060]  Look it up for yourself.
[1:59:13.060 --> 1:59:17.060]  The effects of deep, restful sleep on health and the immune system.
[1:59:17.060 --> 1:59:20.060]  And so, with everything we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D
[1:59:20.060 --> 1:59:22.060]  and zinc and all of it, that's great.
[1:59:22.060 --> 1:59:25.060]  But deep, restful sleep is just as important, maybe more important.
[1:59:25.060 --> 1:59:31.060]  So, infowarstore.com now can announce 50% off on our best-selling product down and out
[1:59:31.060 --> 1:59:34.060]  that just came back in after four months being sold out.
[1:59:34.060 --> 1:59:37.060]  It's 50% off, it's super strong, so be careful with it.
[1:59:37.060 --> 1:59:40.060]  If you want deep, restful sleep, this will do it.
[1:59:40.060 --> 1:59:41.060]  Everybody loves it.
[1:59:41.060 --> 1:59:44.060]  Five stars, infowarstore.com down and out.
[1:59:44.060 --> 2:00:11.060]  Now, back in stock, 50% off.
[2:00:11.060 --> 2:00:16.060]  You really blew that call, didn't you, General?
[2:00:16.060 --> 2:00:22.060]  I believe that that was a issue of strategic stalemate and that if we had remained in Afghanistan
[2:00:22.060 --> 2:00:26.060]  with the advisory levels of effort, then the government of Afghanistan and the Afghanistan Security Forces.
[2:00:26.060 --> 2:00:27.060]  Well, that's an interesting answer to a question.
[2:00:27.060 --> 2:00:29.060]  It's just not one I asked.
[2:00:29.060 --> 2:00:36.060]  You spent more time with Bob Woodward on this book than you spent analyzing the very likely prospect
[2:00:36.060 --> 2:00:40.060]  that the Afghanistan government was going to fall immediately to the Taliban, didn't you?
[2:00:40.060 --> 2:00:41.060]  Not even close, Congressman.
[2:00:41.060 --> 2:00:42.060]  Oh, really?
[2:00:42.060 --> 2:00:47.060]  Because you said right after Kabul fell that no one could have anticipated the immediate fall of the Ghani government.
[2:00:47.060 --> 2:00:53.060]  When did you become aware that Joe Biden tried to get Ghani to lie about the conditions in Afghanistan?
[2:00:53.060 --> 2:00:54.060]  He did that in July.
[2:00:54.060 --> 2:00:55.060]  Did you know that right away?
[2:00:55.060 --> 2:00:59.060]  I'm not aware of what President Biden...
[2:00:59.060 --> 2:01:02.060]  You're not aware of the phone call that Biden had with Ghani where he said,
[2:01:02.060 --> 2:01:07.060]  whether it is true or not, we want you to go out there and paint a rosy picture of what's going on in Afghanistan.
[2:01:07.060 --> 2:01:10.060]  You're the chief military advisor to the president.
[2:01:10.060 --> 2:01:14.060]  You said that the Taliban was not going to defeat the government of Afghanistan militarily,
[2:01:14.060 --> 2:01:17.060]  which, by the way, they cut through him like a hot knife through butter.
[2:01:17.060 --> 2:01:19.060]  And then the president tries to get Ghani to lie.
[2:01:19.060 --> 2:01:21.060]  When did you become aware of that attempt?
[2:01:21.060 --> 2:01:24.060]  Well, there's two things there, Congressman, if I may.
[2:01:24.060 --> 2:01:28.060]  One is what I said was the situation was still me.
[2:01:28.060 --> 2:01:34.060]  And if we kept the advisors with there, the government of Afghanistan and the army would have still been there.
[2:01:34.060 --> 2:01:35.060]  That's what I said.
[2:01:35.060 --> 2:01:37.060]  Whether that's right or wrong, I don't know.
[2:01:37.060 --> 2:01:38.060]  Seems wrong now with the Taliban control.
[2:01:38.060 --> 2:01:40.060]  Well, we would throw all the questions for Secretary Austin.
[2:01:40.060 --> 2:01:50.060]  Secretary Austin, are you capable of assessing whether another has the will to fight?
[2:01:50.060 --> 2:01:51.060]  No, we're not.
[2:01:51.060 --> 2:01:54.060]  And that's the point that the chairman made earlier.
[2:01:54.060 --> 2:01:59.060]  That's just like an incredibly disappointing thing for the secretary of defense to simply say,
[2:01:59.060 --> 2:02:02.060]  I can't assess whether someone has the will to fight.
[2:02:02.060 --> 2:02:04.060]  But it is consistent with your record.
[2:02:04.060 --> 2:02:11.060]  During the Obama administration, I think they gave you about $48 million to go train up some folks in Syria to go take on the Assad government.
[2:02:11.060 --> 2:02:16.060]  And I think your testimony was that only four or five survived first contact with the enemy.
[2:02:16.060 --> 2:02:22.060]  So what confidence should this committee have in you or should the country have in you when you've now confessed to us?
[2:02:22.060 --> 2:02:29.060]  And whether it's the swing and a miss in Afghanistan that General Milley talked to the Senate about yesterday, total failure,
[2:02:29.060 --> 2:02:35.060]  whether it was your failures in Syria, you don't seem capable to look at a fighting force and determine whether or not they have the will.
[2:02:35.060 --> 2:02:49.060]  Well, you recall, Congressman, that the end result was the SDF that we stood up that was very, very instrumental in turning the tide of battle up in Syria.
[2:02:49.060 --> 2:02:50.060]  Oh, yeah.
[2:02:50.060 --> 2:02:51.060]  Turned it so much.
[2:02:51.060 --> 2:02:53.060]  You've got Assad empowered in Syria.
[2:02:53.060 --> 2:02:55.060]  You've got the Taliban empowered in Afghanistan.
[2:02:55.060 --> 2:02:57.060]  I mean, where have you been?
[2:02:57.060 --> 2:03:06.060]  The focus was ISIS, Congressman, and those forces had significant effect on the ISIS network.
[2:03:06.060 --> 2:03:09.060]  Well, it just seems like you're chronically bad at this.
[2:03:09.060 --> 2:03:13.060]  And you have admitted that, I guess, which is to your credit.
[2:03:13.060 --> 2:03:21.060]  But, you know, when people in the military like Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Scheller stand up and demand accountability,
[2:03:21.060 --> 2:03:29.060]  when they say that you all screwed up, when they point out that General Milley's statement that the government of Afghanistan is not going to get defeated by the Taliban,
[2:03:29.060 --> 2:03:31.060]  well, he ends up in the brig.
[2:03:31.060 --> 2:03:36.060]  And you all end up in front of us, and your former employer, Raytheon, ends up with a lot of money,
[2:03:36.060 --> 2:03:43.060]  and we have poured cash and blood and credibility into a Ghani government that was a mirage.
[2:03:43.060 --> 2:03:44.060]  It fell immediately.
[2:03:44.060 --> 2:03:51.060]  And while the guy sitting next to you was off, you know, talking to Phil Rucker and was off doing his thing with Bob Woodward,
[2:03:51.060 --> 2:03:54.060]  we were buying into the big lie.
[2:03:54.060 --> 2:04:01.060]  The big lie that this was ever going to be successful and that we could ever rely on the Afghanistan government for anything at all.
[2:04:01.060 --> 2:04:08.060]  You know, General Milley, you kind of gave up the game earlier when you said you wanted to address elements of your personal conduct that were in question.
[2:04:08.060 --> 2:04:11.060]  We're not questioning your personal conduct.
[2:04:11.060 --> 2:04:18.060]  We're questioning, in your official capacity, going and undermining the chain of command, which is obviously what you did.
[2:04:18.060 --> 2:04:20.060]  You've created this whole chain of communication narrative.
[2:04:20.060 --> 2:04:21.060]  You did not undermine the chain of command.
[2:04:21.060 --> 2:04:22.060]  Yeah, you did.
[2:04:22.060 --> 2:04:23.060]  You absolutely did.
[2:04:23.060 --> 2:04:24.060]  You did not.
[2:04:24.060 --> 2:04:27.060]  Well, you know what?
[2:04:27.060 --> 2:04:32.060]  You said yesterday that you weren't going to resign when senators asked you this question.
[2:04:32.060 --> 2:04:34.060]  And I believe that you guys probably won't resign.
[2:04:34.060 --> 2:04:39.060]  You seem to be very happy failing up over there.
[2:04:39.060 --> 2:04:46.060]  But if we didn't have a president that was so addled, you all would be fired because that is what you deserve.
[2:04:46.060 --> 2:04:50.060]  You have let down the people who wear the uniform in my district and all around this country.
[2:04:50.060 --> 2:04:57.060]  And you're far more interested in what your perception is and how people think about you in insider Washington books.
[2:04:57.060 --> 2:05:03.060]  So if you understand that this is not FDA approved, it's totally experimental.
[2:05:03.060 --> 2:05:06.060]  It's never been given to human beings before.
[2:05:06.060 --> 2:05:13.060]  Some of the ingredients inside of these shots have never been injected in human beings before.
[2:05:13.060 --> 2:05:16.060]  There are no long term studies.
[2:05:16.060 --> 2:05:25.060]  We don't know what's going to happen inside your body somewhere four to six weeks after your second injection or four to six months or even two years.
[2:05:25.060 --> 2:05:34.060]  We have no idea whether it's going to cause infertility, whether it's going to cause cancer, how bad your autoimmune disease is going to be.
[2:05:34.060 --> 2:05:39.060]  My conclusion after looking at this for a long time and listening to the arguments for these masks,
[2:05:39.060 --> 2:06:06.060]  I've determined that if you believe, if you're a medical doctor or a scientist that's using these masks, you're either being played or you're being paid.
[2:06:06.060 --> 2:06:09.060]  You found it the tip of the spear.
[2:06:09.060 --> 2:06:16.060]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[2:06:16.060 --> 2:06:20.060]  That's why I said that.
[2:06:20.060 --> 2:06:23.060]  We got it.
[2:06:23.060 --> 2:06:24.060]  Thank you all very much.
[2:06:24.060 --> 2:06:25.060]  It's going to be a bad full day.
[2:06:25.060 --> 2:06:27.060]  Perhaps I'll see you along the way.
[2:06:27.060 --> 2:06:29.060]  Hi.
[2:06:29.060 --> 2:06:31.060]  I'll see you along the way.
[2:06:31.060 --> 2:06:33.060]  Think positively.
[2:06:33.060 --> 2:06:48.060]  Okay, there's Nancy Pelosi seeming to be drunk off of her behind at about 9am this morning.
[2:06:48.060 --> 2:06:51.060]  She's in a real good spot there.
[2:06:51.060 --> 2:06:52.060]  So there's her.
[2:06:52.060 --> 2:06:54.060]  There's Nancy Pelosi.
[2:06:54.060 --> 2:06:59.060]  Then there's Jim Hoff joining me now from the Gateway Pundit.
[2:06:59.060 --> 2:07:03.060]  It was a pleasure to be joined by our friends over there at the Gateway Pundit.
[2:07:03.060 --> 2:07:09.060]  We got a lot to get into there, but an interesting, you know, 14 or so hours for Nancy Pelosi.
[2:07:09.060 --> 2:07:12.060]  She's raging on some phone call.
[2:07:12.060 --> 2:07:18.060]  She's raging on some mystery phone call last night at the Congressional Baseball Game Mask Free, by the way.
[2:07:18.060 --> 2:07:20.060]  And then there she is.
[2:07:20.060 --> 2:07:26.060]  I mean, I don't know how else he would explain that other than it appears that she's inebriated in front of the press today.
[2:07:26.060 --> 2:07:29.060]  She is really on a roll, isn't she?
[2:07:29.060 --> 2:07:31.060]  She sure is, Owen.
[2:07:31.060 --> 2:07:32.060]  Good to be with you.
[2:07:32.060 --> 2:07:35.060]  She must have restocked her refrigerator with that beer.
[2:07:35.060 --> 2:07:37.060]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[2:07:37.060 --> 2:07:42.060]  January 6th, one of those protesters was arrested for drinking one of her beers.
[2:07:42.060 --> 2:07:46.060]  And so she must have restocked that fridge with ice cream and beer.
[2:07:46.060 --> 2:07:48.060]  She seemed very happy this morning.
[2:07:48.060 --> 2:07:53.060]  But again, it's hard to watch that woman, isn't it?
[2:07:53.060 --> 2:07:57.060]  The lies on top of lies on top of lies that come from her mouth.
[2:07:57.060 --> 2:07:58.060]  And you're right.
[2:07:58.060 --> 2:08:01.060]  It would be interesting to know who she was talking to last night.
[2:08:01.060 --> 2:08:04.060]  Was that, you know, Manchin?
[2:08:04.060 --> 2:08:07.060]  Was it Kristen Sinema from Arizona?
[2:08:07.060 --> 2:08:10.060]  Was it one of her, the squad members?
[2:08:10.060 --> 2:08:15.060]  Who was it that she's reaming out during the Congressional Baseball Game?
[2:08:15.060 --> 2:08:22.060]  Because they're so desperate to pass this $3.5 trillion spending bill so they can spend $3.5 trillion, but somehow it costs $0.
[2:08:22.060 --> 2:08:24.060]  At least that's the logic they want.
[2:08:24.060 --> 2:08:27.060]  But not all members of Congress are insane liars.
[2:08:27.060 --> 2:08:30.060]  You guys have this story right now at the Gateway Pundit.
[2:08:30.060 --> 2:08:32.060]  Not making headlines.
[2:08:32.060 --> 2:08:39.060]  Senator Ron Johnson just exposed on the Senate floor that COVID vaccines do not appear to work as advertised.
[2:08:39.060 --> 2:08:42.060]  And they've pretty much all admitted this now, Joe.
[2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:52.060]  And even Dr. abortion, Lena Nguyen, goes on CNN and says that now the vaccinated pose a risk to the unvaccinated because they're the ones causing the spread.
[2:08:52.060 --> 2:08:58.060]  And so that's their new argument is, hey, if you're unvaccinated, the vaccinated might get you sick.
[2:08:58.060 --> 2:09:00.060]  It's insane, isn't it?
[2:09:00.060 --> 2:09:02.060]  It changes every day, it seems to.
[2:09:02.060 --> 2:09:09.060]  And this chart that I posted up there, this was Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin yesterday speaking on the Senate floor.
[2:09:09.060 --> 2:09:12.060]  And if you look at this chart, it's amazing.
[2:09:12.060 --> 2:09:20.060]  What he states in his segment there is that the numbers for COVID was already coming down naturally.
[2:09:20.060 --> 2:09:23.060]  Then we had the injection of the vaccines.
[2:09:23.060 --> 2:09:31.060]  You can see the red line there is a vaccine numbers in the United States going up for the next three, four months to about 60% where it is today.
[2:09:31.060 --> 2:09:38.060]  And now that we have this huge amount, a majority of Americans vaccinated, you can see it didn't stop.
[2:09:38.060 --> 2:09:45.060]  The COVID from coming back late this summer to where it is today with this Delta variant.
[2:09:45.060 --> 2:09:48.060]  So it did nothing to stop the Delta variant.
[2:09:48.060 --> 2:09:53.060]  And again, we see that now the Delta variant is naturally coming back down.
[2:09:53.060 --> 2:09:57.060]  So Johnson gave an amazing speech there.
[2:09:57.060 --> 2:10:12.060]  And he just lays it out with the facts and the numbers that it appears that these vaccines had nothing to do with this pandemic spreading.
[2:10:12.060 --> 2:10:16.060]  It had nothing to do with the pandemic ending naturally.
[2:10:16.060 --> 2:10:22.060]  And so I hope your audience watches that it's two minutes long and it's just fantastic.
[2:10:22.060 --> 2:10:29.060]  Well, not only that, if you look at the graph, and this is basic math, I mean, any elementary school student could point this out.
[2:10:29.060 --> 2:10:38.060]  It's clear that the resurgence of COVID or Delta or whatever they want to call it comes almost exactly at the same rate of the vaccine.
[2:10:38.060 --> 2:10:40.060]  I mean, right there, it's like, there's the vaccine.
[2:10:40.060 --> 2:10:41.060]  There's the COVID rate.
[2:10:41.060 --> 2:10:44.060]  I mean, it's pretty much right there.
[2:10:44.060 --> 2:10:53.060]  Yeah, right in front of our eyes, and yet we have this nonsense, these people continue to throw at us and hurl at us, including Dr. Fauci,
[2:10:53.060 --> 2:11:02.060]  this megalomaniac who was behind the creation of this vaccine, who was funding it, who's the producer of the coronavirus at the Wuhan lab.
[2:11:02.060 --> 2:11:07.060]  And yet now he's the one who's trying to tell us how to deal with this.
[2:11:07.060 --> 2:11:10.060]  It's absolutely insane.
[2:11:10.060 --> 2:11:16.060]  I took a trip to the airport yesterday to drop off a loved one at the airport.
[2:11:16.060 --> 2:11:25.060]  You put on the mask, you go inside, you know, you have to make sure you have a vaccine or a shot if you're going out overseas.
[2:11:25.060 --> 2:11:30.060]  It's absolute insanity and it doesn't appear that any of this is working.
[2:11:30.060 --> 2:11:33.060]  And yet Dr. Fauci is still in charge.
[2:11:33.060 --> 2:11:42.060]  I have a theory that this will not clear up until Dr. Fauci is gone and he should be prosecuted because what he's done is committed mass murder by allowing,
[2:11:42.060 --> 2:11:56.060]  by condemning hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, which could have saved millions of lives right now, but he politically used that as a political bludgeon to hit Trump.
[2:11:56.060 --> 2:12:04.060]  And now we know that those are effective means to treat this coronavirus and he prevented people from using it.
[2:12:04.060 --> 2:12:06.060]  It's outrageous.
[2:12:06.060 --> 2:12:14.060]  Well, not only that, I guess the CEOs of Big Pharma run the country now and the CEO of Biotech.
[2:12:14.060 --> 2:12:21.060]  I think it was the CEO, but if somebody at Biotech comes out and says, yeah, COVID's here forever, but don't worry with us, we'll be able to manage it.
[2:12:21.060 --> 2:12:26.060]  Meaning you're going to be a prisoner, essentially in the new COVID world.
[2:12:26.060 --> 2:12:33.060]  But don't worry because Biotech and Pfizer, they have our backs, even though, like you said, they banned ivermectin from being used.
[2:12:33.060 --> 2:12:42.060]  But now Pfizer is about to release its own ivermectin that I'm sure will be okay to use now at five times the price of the normal ivermectin.
[2:12:42.060 --> 2:12:44.060]  Yeah, at least five times the price.
[2:12:44.060 --> 2:12:53.060]  And, you know, we put up a story at Gateway Pundit last week where they're using this in a province or district over in India having amazing results.
[2:12:53.060 --> 2:13:00.060]  Their cases of coronavirus have been limited after they started pushing the ivermectin in India.
[2:13:00.060 --> 2:13:05.060]  So again, the media has lied about this continuously.
[2:13:05.060 --> 2:13:22.060]  People like you guys at Info Wars in the war room and Gateway Pundit, we get bludgeoned by these dirty politicians and the mainstream media for putting up what is, ends up to be the truth time and time again.
[2:13:22.060 --> 2:13:34.060]  Well, and it's so frustrating to not just reporting on it in real time, but if you go back in time, we were reporting on this before it even happened because this is what all the doctors and scientists were telling us.
[2:13:34.060 --> 2:13:38.060]  They said, look, the vaccine is actually going to get people sick.
[2:13:38.060 --> 2:13:40.060]  The vaccine is going to cause these cytokine storms.
[2:13:40.060 --> 2:13:42.060]  The vaccine is going to cause the variants.
[2:13:42.060 --> 2:13:48.060]  And then all of that happened a year later after the doctors and scientists that were being censored off the internet told us.
[2:13:48.060 --> 2:13:50.060]  And now we're just watching it all happen.
[2:13:50.060 --> 2:13:55.060]  And like you said, we were attacked for reporting that truth a year ago.
[2:13:55.060 --> 2:14:00.060]  And I guess now we know why they were censoring those doctors because how else could they sell all these vaccines?
[2:14:00.060 --> 2:14:02.060]  How else could they sell these boosters?
[2:14:02.060 --> 2:14:05.060]  How else could they ban ivermectin and all these things?
[2:14:05.060 --> 2:14:09.060]  Well, they didn't want you to know that they knew that this was going to happen.
[2:14:09.060 --> 2:14:11.060]  They knew the vaccine was going to cause the variants.
[2:14:11.060 --> 2:14:13.060]  They knew that the vaccinated were going to be a threat to the unvaccinated.
[2:14:13.060 --> 2:14:14.060]  Now it's all here.
[2:14:14.060 --> 2:14:18.060]  And so they're just saying, well, this is just a big pharmaceutical takeover.
[2:14:18.060 --> 2:14:20.060]  So just get over it.
[2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:22.060]  Yeah, it's insane.
[2:14:22.060 --> 2:14:34.060]  And we continue all in to see these stories time and time again of what we're seeing that the vaccinated now are the ones who are going in the hospital or the ones who are getting sick.
[2:14:34.060 --> 2:14:40.060]  There was a story out of Australia for six of the seven people who died in New Wales.
[2:14:40.060 --> 2:14:43.060]  South New Wales were already vaccinated.
[2:14:43.060 --> 2:14:49.060]  And of course, the majority was over 70 or 80 years old.
[2:14:49.060 --> 2:14:53.060]  So again, we get proven right with time.
[2:14:53.060 --> 2:14:57.060]  People with integrity expect to be believed when they're not in that time, prove them right.
[2:14:57.060 --> 2:15:00.060]  And that's what's going on right now.
[2:15:00.060 --> 2:15:12.060]  And people are just losing trust with our medical community, which is really a shame because we, you know, how did we know two years ago that our medical community was so corrupt?
[2:15:12.060 --> 2:15:14.060]  We do today.
[2:15:14.060 --> 2:15:21.060]  And by the way, that video clip that you're mentioning is one of the most crazy things ever because it's like it just gets more insane in the 50 seconds as it goes on.
[2:15:21.060 --> 2:15:23.060]  First, they're like, oh my gosh, seven people died.
[2:15:23.060 --> 2:15:25.060]  You're like seven people.
[2:15:25.060 --> 2:15:26.060]  That's it.
[2:15:26.060 --> 2:15:27.060]  And you have all this tyranny.
[2:15:27.060 --> 2:15:30.060]  And then it's like six of the seven had vaccines.
[2:15:30.060 --> 2:15:32.060]  And they're like, wait, what?
[2:15:32.060 --> 2:15:34.060]  And then it was the vaccinated.
[2:15:34.060 --> 2:15:36.060]  It's just, it's just complete madness.
[2:15:36.060 --> 2:15:38.060]  Jim Hoft is with us from the Gateway Pundit.
[2:15:38.060 --> 2:15:40.060]  We're about to go to a break.
[2:15:40.060 --> 2:15:50.060]  We're talking into some of the other breaking news that's breaking at Info Wars and Gateway Pundit right now, including members of the military being persecuted by the Democrats because they speak out against Biden.
[2:15:50.060 --> 2:15:59.060]  And speaking of Biden, he just can't stop harassing women as he does it again last night at a baseball game.
[2:15:59.060 --> 2:16:06.060]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[2:16:06.060 --> 2:16:09.060]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:16:09.060 --> 2:16:15.060]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:20:08.060 --> 2:20:27.060]  Jim Hoft is our guest here on the Alex Jones Show. Owen Schreuer sitting in studio for Alex.
[2:20:27.060 --> 2:20:32.060]  Some of the latest headlines from the Gateway Pundit. Here's one. This is a very big story.
[2:20:32.060 --> 2:20:42.060]  Lance Corporal Hunter Clark, who rescued baby in Kabul, is under investigation by the Department of Defense for Speaking at Trump Rally out of uniform.
[2:20:42.060 --> 2:20:53.060]  Also, they have arrested now Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer for daring to call out the failed Biden regime strategy in Afghanistan.
[2:20:53.060 --> 2:21:03.060]  You know, Jim, here's the story to me. The left is allowed to have their politicized operatives inside the military and everywhere else.
[2:21:03.060 --> 2:21:06.060]  They're allowed to do that and they can criticize Trump and backstab Trump and hell make calls to China outside of the chain of command.
[2:21:06.060 --> 2:21:13.060]  But, oh, one little guy, one little guy in the military dares step up and say the truth or dares say, hey, look, Trump's a good guy.
[2:21:13.060 --> 2:21:21.060]  And they suffer the full force of the rules and regulations. It's just yet another example of the left's double standards now in the military.
[2:21:21.060 --> 2:21:30.060]  Absolutely. As you recall, last year or two years ago, oh, a bin man who went in to testify against Trump.
[2:21:30.060 --> 2:21:37.060]  This this leaker who was behind the first impeachment of Trump over a phone call.
[2:21:37.060 --> 2:21:45.060]  He comes in in full dress uniform, right? That's okay with the left. That was perfectly fine to testify against the commander in chief.
[2:21:45.060 --> 2:21:53.060]  He had to wear his uniform dress. But this hero who was stuck in Kabul was rescuing babies.
[2:21:53.060 --> 2:22:02.060]  People were just handing to him over the wall made, you know, international news because it was so shocking what was happening in Kabul as we all watched this.
[2:22:02.060 --> 2:22:14.060]  Now he's under investigation because Trump called him up and he said to the crowd, literally, he said, this is the most the proudest I've ever been in my life was rescuing this baby.
[2:22:14.060 --> 2:22:20.060]  That's all he said. And then he walked off the stage and shook Trump's hand.
[2:22:20.060 --> 2:22:30.060]  And now he's under investigation. It's really unbelievable, Owen, because we have generals sitting in front of Congress who just surrendered Afghanistan.
[2:22:30.060 --> 2:22:40.060]  They armed the Taliban with $85 billion of U.S. weapons. They've left thousands of Americans and green card holders over there.
[2:22:40.060 --> 2:22:49.060]  They allowed other Afghans just bum rush the airport. We don't know who the hell they are. There's being spread all over the country.
[2:22:49.060 --> 2:22:57.060]  They're already raping kids and harassing women as some of these bases. And yet these generals who sit there, there's nothing that happens to them.
[2:22:57.060 --> 2:23:04.060]  Only this hero is one kid who is there in Kabul saving babies. Now he's the one under investigation.
[2:23:04.060 --> 2:23:15.060]  Everything is completely upside down. And I think people are getting furious about this nonsense and this absolute corruption we're seeing in the U.S. military.
[2:23:15.060 --> 2:23:22.060]  It's really sad to see just all the political persecution happening. But even the military now it's reaching there.
[2:23:22.060 --> 2:23:32.060]  And again, they throw they throw Sheller in the brig. Who knows if he'll ever be out. There have been multiple petitions coming from Republicans in Congress to have him released.
[2:23:32.060 --> 2:23:40.060]  And now you got this Lance Corporal Hunter Clark who's under investigation simply for stepping up saying, hey, I'm so glad I saved this baby.
[2:23:40.060 --> 2:23:44.060]  I love America and shaking Trump's hand. That's that's apparently worthy of an investigation.
[2:23:44.060 --> 2:23:50.060]  But hey, General Milley can go outside, chain a command and call China and do book leaks with with Bob Woodward and the rest of it.
[2:23:50.060 --> 2:23:53.060]  And that's all fine and dandy and that's all fine and good.
[2:23:53.060 --> 2:24:07.060]  But, you know, speaking of the Biden issue here, so he cancels he was supposed to be in Chicago yesterday to talk about the vaccine mandates because Chicago a large black American population doesn't want to get the vaccine.
[2:24:07.060 --> 2:24:14.060]  So he was supposed to go push vaccines on him yesterday. I guess considering that the homicide rate in Chicago is through the roof.
[2:24:14.060 --> 2:24:24.060]  And he thought maybe that would be the story he decided to abandon that, or maybe he had to stay behind because all the lies he told about Afghanistan are now coming out in these congressional hearings with Milley and Austin.
[2:24:24.060 --> 2:24:27.060]  So he had to stay behind to run cover for that either way.
[2:24:27.060 --> 2:24:37.060]  He shows up to the baseball game last night mask free and immediately saunters over to some innocent woman boxes her in and gets right in her face without a mask.
[2:24:37.060 --> 2:24:42.060]  Do we have any idea who this woman is by the way? I don't know anybody that's ID her as the Gateway punnab been able to.
[2:24:42.060 --> 2:24:50.060]  We haven't identified her yet. But again, that's that's a great way to describe it. He boxes her and he puts his arms to to where she's a captive.
[2:24:50.060 --> 2:25:02.060]  I mean, who does that? I used to work in human resources for a while, Owen. And I know there was one one man who worked where I was at and every time he came in a room he'd go, you know, a beeline to the women.
[2:25:02.060 --> 2:25:07.060]  He always put his hands on him, you know, and and chum up with him. And it was really kind of disgusting.
[2:25:07.060 --> 2:25:15.060]  That's Joe Biden, except Joe Biden does it with women and children. And he sniffs their hair. This is one creepy dude.
[2:25:15.060 --> 2:25:28.060]  He can't he can't stop it. He does this wherever he goes. And the left gives him a complete pass. They want us to think that Donald Trump is some sort of perp when they have this guy in the White House.
[2:25:28.060 --> 2:25:39.060]  It's it's unbelievable. I mean, look at that. Who does that? Oh, and I've never done that in my life to just kind of hold someone captive like that and sit there and flirt with them.
[2:25:39.060 --> 2:25:47.060]  It's so damn creepy. And yet is the media going to say anything about this today? We all know the answer to that.
[2:25:47.060 --> 2:25:54.060]  And again, not to mention this is the guy promoting the hell where to masks where the triple mask if you can please I'm Joe Biden.
[2:25:54.060 --> 2:25:58.060]  I want you to live in fear. But then he goes and he gets right in this women's face.
[2:25:58.060 --> 2:26:04.060]  Women's face walks around the ballpark without a mask on as they encourage everybody else. You have to wear a mask all the time.
[2:26:04.060 --> 2:26:12.060]  He gets in this woman's face without a mask. And I don't know if you saw the story the other the other week it pretty much went uncovered.
[2:26:12.060 --> 2:26:18.060]  I keep bringing it up hoping that it'll finally go viral. And I believe it was in slate and guys try to pull it up for me.
[2:26:18.060 --> 2:26:28.060]  I think it was in slate, but I can't remember. But it's basically the actual grassroots people of the Me Too movement and the Times Up movement have now realized and they've admitted they've written stories.
[2:26:28.060 --> 2:26:34.060]  There was a big one just in slate where the Times Up movement went wrong and they admit we were fooled. It was a Democrat operation from the get go.
[2:26:34.060 --> 2:26:42.060]  It had nothing to do with women. It was all about the Democrats. It was all about attacking Trump and their final straw was they found out.
[2:26:42.060 --> 2:26:48.060]  First of all, the head honchos are all making just six figure salary somehow. They don't get anything.
[2:26:48.060 --> 2:26:58.060]  And then they found out that during the Cuomo scandal they thought, oh, Times Up Me Too would be helping these women that have accused a powerful man Cuomo of the charges.
[2:26:58.060 --> 2:27:05.060]  And guess what? They went after the women. They slandered and attacked the women. And so they wrote this huge article like we were fooled.
[2:27:05.060 --> 2:27:12.060]  Times Up Me Too was never about women. It was always about the Democrat Party. Now they're attacking victims of these men.
[2:27:12.060 --> 2:27:17.060]  And it's like it just kind of just was like a tumbleweed in the desert, Jim. Nobody cared.
[2:27:17.060 --> 2:27:25.060]  Yeah, it's like Clinton 2.0, isn't it? You know, where they were going after those women too. It's unbelievable what these people do.
[2:27:25.060 --> 2:27:31.060]  Isn't it interesting too that the Me Too movement, I guess they gave up on that because everybody they were catching were Democrats.
[2:27:31.060 --> 2:27:38.060]  You know, and so they got tired of that. They kept knocking all these Democrats off these platforms.
[2:27:38.060 --> 2:27:49.060]  So anyway, but you're right. It never was about the women. It never was about harassment. It's just about how they could have punished Trump, which didn't work, by the way.
[2:27:49.060 --> 2:27:59.060]  But you're absolutely right. They don't care about these women that are getting hurt. And just as an example, what we were just talking about, Joe Biden boxing in this woman last night
[2:27:59.060 --> 2:28:03.060]  and holding her captive at the baseball game.
[2:28:03.060 --> 2:28:11.060]  And think about the hubris that he has, even even knowing that the Me Too, you know, thing kind of still lurks out there as a media talking point.
[2:28:11.060 --> 2:28:19.060]  He has no qualms. He has no hesitation. Kids goes up, sniffs them, touches them. Women goes right up, sniffs them, touches them, boxes them in.
[2:28:19.060 --> 2:28:27.060]  He's got so much confidence that the media is going to protect him that he just does it anyway without even a single hesitation.
[2:28:27.060 --> 2:28:39.060]  Absolutely. He can't help it. He doesn't care. They don't care. If they did care, they'd be saying more about it. But again, we don't see this making any headlines today.
[2:28:39.060 --> 2:28:49.060]  And it explains a lot about his son and his strange behavior. Ultra strange that he could have us orgies with so many people.
[2:28:49.060 --> 2:28:56.060]  And literally do porn videos for the Internet. Let's just hope that Biden had a real diaper on since he didn't have the face diaper on.
[2:28:56.060 --> 2:29:04.060]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:29:04.060 --> 2:29:14.060]  Here's why. We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:29:14.060 --> 2:29:23.060]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:23.060 --> 2:29:32.060]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:32.060 --> 2:29:38.060]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.

[2:30:53.060 --> 2:30:56.060]  I thank you for your support because it keeps us on the air.
[2:31:01.060 --> 2:31:05.060]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[2:31:05.060 --> 2:31:14.060]  Challenge, first of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[2:31:14.060 --> 2:31:21.060]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called, but since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[2:31:21.060 --> 2:31:30.060]  my skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old, and I was already taking your other supplements,
[2:31:30.060 --> 2:31:35.060]  but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation,
[2:31:35.060 --> 2:31:41.060]  but when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time,
[2:31:41.060 --> 2:31:47.060]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[2:31:47.060 --> 2:31:53.060]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully,
[2:31:53.060 --> 2:31:57.060]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:31:57.060 --> 2:32:03.060]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems of these employees,
[2:32:03.060 --> 2:32:08.060]  because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical energy during your work,
[2:32:08.060 --> 2:32:12.060]  during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary system
[2:32:12.060 --> 2:32:17.060]  because you change the way that you breathe. You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[2:32:17.060 --> 2:32:22.060]  That taxes the heart, it taxes the lungs, and we have given people heart attacks
[2:32:22.060 --> 2:32:28.060]  by allowing them to work with their mouth and nose covered with absolutely no regulation,
[2:32:28.060 --> 2:32:31.060]  no oversight, no medical oversight.
[2:32:31.060 --> 2:32:35.060]  The globalists have told us we're a disease, they've told us they want to eradicate us,
[2:32:35.060 --> 2:32:40.060]  and all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up to one-third
[2:32:40.060 --> 2:32:44.060]  and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[2:32:44.060 --> 2:32:47.060]  This is a sick cult, and we've got to say no.
[2:32:47.060 --> 2:32:51.060]  But the only way the real science can sound to the public is if we tell them,
[2:32:51.060 --> 2:33:08.060]  get your copy today of COVIDland and expose them. It's covidland.com. Go there now.
[2:33:21.060 --> 2:33:27.060]  It's Alex Jones. And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:33:27.060 --> 2:33:34.060]  Yes, the vaccine religious cult continues to just get weirder and weirder every day.
[2:33:34.060 --> 2:33:42.060]  That's fine. We'll let them do that. Jim Hoft, one more segment with us from the Gateway Pundit.
[2:33:42.060 --> 2:33:47.060]  And you guys have another incredible story here with the video, which is just as powerful.
[2:33:47.060 --> 2:33:51.060]  There were large pieces torn off, bubbles being filled, absolutely perfect.
[2:33:51.060 --> 2:33:57.060]  60,000 illegal ballots. Arizona audit volunteers speak out on disturbing findings.
[2:33:57.060 --> 2:34:00.060]  Must see video. It's there on the Gateway Pundit.
[2:34:00.060 --> 2:34:04.060]  So the Attorney General of Arizona is taking this seriously.
[2:34:04.060 --> 2:34:09.060]  I think he's a little perturbed at the current time. I'd like your take on this.
[2:34:09.060 --> 2:34:17.060]  To me, Attorney General Bernovich seems to be just aghast at the fact that they did the audit.
[2:34:17.060 --> 2:34:21.060]  They have the evidence. He's now preserved the evidence for further litigation,
[2:34:21.060 --> 2:34:23.060]  maybe a criminal investigation incoming.
[2:34:23.060 --> 2:34:28.060]  But he's like, OK, sharing it with the media, sharing it with the state senate, sharing it with the representatives,
[2:34:28.060 --> 2:34:31.060]  sharing it with the Congress. And it's just like falls on deaf ears.
[2:34:31.060 --> 2:34:36.060]  And he's just like, wait a second. Here's the audit. Here's the proof. Election interference.
[2:34:36.060 --> 2:34:39.060]  And it's like nobody cares.
[2:34:39.060 --> 2:34:41.060]  Right. It's unbelievable, isn't it?
[2:34:41.060 --> 2:34:44.060]  You know what? It should have been predictable.
[2:34:44.060 --> 2:34:46.060]  But we shouldn't know this was coming.
[2:34:46.060 --> 2:34:52.060]  But the night before they released the audit results, the media already came out with their talking point.
[2:34:52.060 --> 2:34:55.060]  He said that the ballots were recounted.
[2:34:55.060 --> 2:34:58.060]  They found the same amount a few more, a few less.
[2:34:58.060 --> 2:35:03.060]  And Joe Biden won. And this is what it says is Joe Biden won and there was no fraud.
[2:35:03.060 --> 2:35:09.060]  So the media immediately came out with this big, the big lie, which was that there was no fraud.
[2:35:09.060 --> 2:35:15.060]  Today we put up a post to get repundant of the different categories of ballots that they had trouble with.
[2:35:15.060 --> 2:35:22.060]  Over 700,000 ballots. Some of these might have been, you know, qualified for different categories.
[2:35:22.060 --> 2:35:30.060]  But these these ballots had issues they need to be investigated, including 83,000 that they looked at.
[2:35:30.060 --> 2:35:38.060]  And this doesn't get any press, right? You imagine if this was reversed, if it was Democrats and Republicans who were, you know, reversed here.
[2:35:38.060 --> 2:35:45.060]  83,000 of these votes, these ballots in Maricopa County, they looked these people up.
[2:35:45.060 --> 2:35:50.060]  They couldn't find the Social Security number. They couldn't find the names that correlated.
[2:35:50.060 --> 2:35:53.060]  They couldn't find the address. Couldn't find anything.
[2:35:53.060 --> 2:36:02.060]  So so they're saying they have 83,000 of this in an election in a state where Trump lost by 10,300 votes lost.
[2:36:02.060 --> 2:36:07.060]  I put that in air quotes because we still believe that Trump won and had this stolen.
[2:36:07.060 --> 2:36:16.060]  But they need to investigate this. Attorney General Bernovich needs to start an investigation and press some criminal charges.
[2:36:16.060 --> 2:36:26.060]  What we still know through this hearing they had on Friday was that they found Maricopa County officials or people who are linked to the county
[2:36:26.060 --> 2:36:33.060]  who are working on the voting machines. They found them deleting deleting files before they turned them over.
[2:36:33.060 --> 2:36:41.060]  So the day before these these Dominion voting machines were turned over to the audit officials, they deleted all these files,
[2:36:41.060 --> 2:36:51.060]  crime, by the way. Absolutely. It's a crime. And they actually said during the hearing that they know who was deleting the files.
[2:36:51.060 --> 2:36:59.060]  So they need to press these criminal charges. They need to investigate this or Democrats will continue to get away with this,
[2:36:59.060 --> 2:37:05.060]  you know, election cycle after election cycle. And it really is the end of our country if we can't fix these elections.
[2:37:05.060 --> 2:37:14.060]  But we believe there's enough there for charges, as you just said, oh, and to be to be filed and that they need to look further at some of these ballots.
[2:37:14.060 --> 2:37:23.060]  Because if they did, if they actually did canvassing in the state, they would find that these aren't real ballots.
[2:37:23.060 --> 2:37:27.060]  These aren't real people. And it could be up in the hundreds of thousands at this point.
[2:37:27.060 --> 2:37:36.060]  And I can't even imagine what's going on behind the scenes. And here's the panic from the Democrats, because they know this is the this is the loose thread that pulls the entire sweater
[2:37:36.060 --> 2:37:43.060]  that exposes the naked emperor. They know that this is the first domino to fall if it really legitimately gets pushed over.
[2:37:43.060 --> 2:37:49.060]  So that's why they've done everything, including committing crimes to try to stop this from happening. And so I agree. And here's the problem.
[2:37:49.060 --> 2:37:57.060]  Tommy Tuberville, Senator in Alabama says, I hope we look at impeachment and Democrat House Committee assignments after the 2022 midterms.
[2:37:57.060 --> 2:38:05.060]  Hey, I get it. I mean, Biden has already had articles of impeachment filed against him. It's just the media won't cover it and Republicans are too cowardly to get behind it.
[2:38:05.060 --> 2:38:11.060]  But that's the problem is so many people have lost faith in the elections after the 2020 presidential elections.
[2:38:11.060 --> 2:38:18.060]  And when I hear people say, oh, everything looks good for the Minterms for Republicans, everything looked great in the 2020 presidential election for Trump.
[2:38:18.060 --> 2:38:24.060]  Everything looked great. And look what happened with that. So this is a serious problem that we have in this country.
[2:38:24.060 --> 2:38:30.060]  And with the lack of confidence in the vote now, you know, I don't know how we overcome it.
[2:38:30.060 --> 2:38:39.060]  Right. And unless they continue these audits and and people go to jail, that's the only thing that's going to stop these Democrats is if they start going to prison.
[2:38:39.060 --> 2:38:51.060]  And so they have to investigate this. This attorney general Bernovich in Arizona, he is running for the Senate. By the way, that's our video from Gateway Pundit right there that you're showing right now on the screen.
[2:38:51.060 --> 2:38:59.060]  That's from the TCF Center in Detroit that we were the only ones in the country who got this video who requested it and it took us months to get it.
[2:38:59.060 --> 2:39:05.060]  That's them leaking the ballots into the TCF Center on election night at 3 30 in the morning.
[2:39:05.060 --> 2:39:17.060]  You guys got another you guys have more surveillance footage now of I think it was what like 20 people depositing thousands of ballots in one of the Zuckerberg ballot boxes.
[2:39:17.060 --> 2:39:24.060]  So you had 20 Democrats, we're assuming sorry, 20 people voting thousands of times in Georgia.
[2:39:24.060 --> 2:39:35.060]  Right. And and you know the news behind that Owen and I could share this with you. We know that true the vote organization is from Texas down down in your neck of the woods.
[2:39:35.060 --> 2:39:44.060]  Catherine Engelbrecht she's been doing this for years she just wants to clean up the voter rolls right and for that she got persecuted by Obama back when he was in office.
[2:39:44.060 --> 2:39:59.060]  Anyway, she's doing this investigation right now where they say they have identified several operatives dropping mass amounts of ballots into these drop boxes at night and not just Georgia now on in several of the swing states.
[2:39:59.060 --> 2:40:11.060]  They're working on that investigation. She had a meeting this week we posted about that. I haven't spoken with her since she had this meeting but she's telling me that it's about to hit the fan.
[2:40:11.060 --> 2:40:22.060]  So to speak with this investigation. So once again we're going to have more proof. It sounds like that they were stuffing the ballot boxes late at night.
[2:40:22.060 --> 2:40:31.060]  It was a it was a planned. It was coordinated. It sounds like they were doing the same thing in several states. It could be a Rico investigation.
[2:40:31.060 --> 2:40:40.060]  But this is the criminal left. This is what they did to steal this election. And you know God willing and I do pray to God that he exposes all of this.
[2:40:40.060 --> 2:40:49.060]  It's definitely needed because it's the only hope we have of getting neocon frauds like Liz Cheney out of office who can be seen today praising General Milley.
[2:40:49.060 --> 2:40:58.060]  Of course she is praising General Milley. So that's going on also and I'm sure the Gateway Pundit will be all over this developing story right now Jim.
[2:40:58.060 --> 2:41:10.060]  You have first of all I.G. Hurwitz discovers more FISA abuses by the FBI. Hundreds of abuses actually discovered by Horowitz that got dropped today.
[2:41:10.060 --> 2:41:17.060]  Technofog is covering that a bad day for FBI Director Chris Ray. We'll see about that. He's gotten away with so much to this point.
[2:41:17.060 --> 2:41:24.060]  And then Durham issues new subpoenas in probe of FBI Russia investigation targets Clinton campaign law firm.
[2:41:24.060 --> 2:41:30.060]  Not just the one attorney. Now it's the whole law firm. Jim this is all breaking right now.
[2:41:30.060 --> 2:41:38.060]  So this may be maybe Durham is going to do something. Although I hear there might be some concern that they won't fund him.
[2:41:38.060 --> 2:41:45.060]  The attorney general Merrick Garland won't fund his investigation in a few more weeks. So maybe he's trying to pile it on right now.
[2:41:45.060 --> 2:41:53.060]  I haven't read enough about that. But at least we're hearing something you know where we didn't hear anything for over a year.
[2:41:53.060 --> 2:42:01.060]  Yeah let's hope Durham actually does the job. We've all been wanting him to do for so long. Hopefully it's not a day later a dollar short.
[2:42:01.060 --> 2:42:09.060]  But of course we have to cover this the Gateway Punnets going to have to cover this to blast it out there because the mainstream news is going to act like it's not going on.
[2:42:09.060 --> 2:42:17.060]  Jim always great to hear from you and by the way congratulations. I'm so glad you guys are live on the air up there in St. Louis that radio station that just launched.
[2:42:17.060 --> 2:42:26.060]  It's like a dream of mine from a decade ago when I was in St. Louis radio realized by you guys now. So just congratulations on that and Godspeed to you guys at the Gateway Pundit.
[2:42:26.060 --> 2:42:33.060]  Oh but thanks so much Owen. I'll let my brother Joe he does a morning show up here. I'll let him know I have you on soon.
[2:42:33.060 --> 2:42:42.060]  That would be fantastic. All right. Jim Haw from the Gateway Pundit the intrepid Gateway Pundit leaves us now.
[2:42:42.060 --> 2:42:57.060]  When we come back I'm going to do a news blitz with the rest of the stories I have here and a couple video clips and then Kate Daly has the fourth hour ahead of the war room.
[2:42:57.060 --> 2:43:04.060]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[2:43:04.060 --> 2:43:12.060]  But if you look at all the different studies reports about NASA and other governments other agencies they all disagree on what's really happening with climate.
[2:43:12.060 --> 2:43:20.060]  The only constant only great truth is change is the only constant. So yes climate change is totally real.
[2:43:20.060 --> 2:43:27.060]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s 80s and then it's going to be global warming and that didn't really happen the way they wanted to.
[2:43:27.060 --> 2:43:38.060]  OK now it's just climate change. But did you know that man made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN.
[2:43:38.060 --> 2:43:45.060]  They have weather control trees for 1979. Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[2:43:45.060 --> 2:43:52.060]  In fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spring different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[2:43:52.060 --> 2:44:01.060]  So yes man made climate change is real. I got some good news. All the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50 percent off.
[2:44:01.060 --> 2:44:10.060]  And then for our store. The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out. So this sales only going from one week starting on September 29th.
[2:44:10.060 --> 2:44:16.060]  And in the case of green fiber capsules these will be sold out in just a couple of days 50 percent off.
[2:44:16.060 --> 2:44:24.060]  We have knockout sleep aid 50 percent off sold out for months. Very popular. Twice as strong as knockout probably too strong for some people.
[2:44:24.060 --> 2:44:31.060]  Totally different formula. Down and out is back in stock 50 percent off. We've extended the sale on winter sun and old for 12 50 percent off.
[2:44:31.060 --> 2:44:38.060]  And also on deep breath crystal iodine survival selects to it's all 40 50 percent off for one week only.
[2:44:38.060 --> 2:44:47.060]  Take advantage of it and find the info war. And I thank you all for your support infowarstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[2:44:47.060 --> 2:44:53.060]  It's a win win. These are things that make you healthy make your life better and they find the info war again.

[2:44:56.060 --> 2:45:03.060]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[2:45:03.060 --> 2:45:10.060]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[2:45:10.060 --> 2:45:20.060]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[2:45:20.060 --> 2:45:29.060]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described as the seat of the soul.
[2:45:29.060 --> 2:45:36.060]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[2:45:36.060 --> 2:45:41.060]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.

[2:46:59.060 --> 2:47:08.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:08.060 --> 2:47:15.060]  There is just so much developing right now.
[2:47:15.060 --> 2:47:17.060]  It's just crazy.
[2:47:17.060 --> 2:47:27.060]  You've got a bill that just passed in Congress to have unlimited numbers of entries from Afghanistan.
[2:47:27.060 --> 2:47:41.060]  So but it's all about bringing in unvetted refugees that have no prospects here to suck off the welfare system not bringing in the Americans or the green card hoarders or the allies that are actually being attacked in Afghanistan right now.
[2:47:41.060 --> 2:47:42.060]  So that's going on.
[2:47:42.060 --> 2:47:50.060]  YouTube has just removed Ron Paul's Institute channel just completely removed it.
[2:47:50.060 --> 2:47:52.060]  But they care about free speech.
[2:47:52.060 --> 2:47:54.060]  So they say.
[2:47:54.060 --> 2:48:00.060]  Let me just get through the rest of the news and video clips I haven't covered here today.
[2:48:00.060 --> 2:48:07.060]  Before I hand the baton over to Kate Daly military units track guns using tech.
[2:48:07.060 --> 2:48:15.060]  And it's a story out of the AP basically you know smart guns that are going to have RFID chips in them so that they can track all the guns and that's the future they want if they can't.
[2:48:15.060 --> 2:48:25.060]  Confiscate them I guess they'd at least rather track them so that's nice and they'll act like oh it's for the military it's for this purpose.
[2:48:25.060 --> 2:48:30.060]  No it's it's for it's for the smart grid the Internet of Things so that if you have a gun if you're a gun or you could be targeted very easily.
[2:48:30.060 --> 2:48:37.060]  We all know that the New York Times wants to redesign the American flag.
[2:48:37.060 --> 2:48:39.060]  Yes that's right.
[2:48:39.060 --> 2:48:48.060]  Re-designing America's flag is the headline at the New York Times and they have all these different examples of the new flag that they want to have.
[2:48:48.060 --> 2:48:59.060]  And it's all about attacking America destroying America because you know America's bad everybody wants to come here and it's created the most prosperity and upward mobility in the world.
[2:48:59.060 --> 2:49:05.060]  And we do more for other countries and foreign aid and refugees than any other country on earth combined.
[2:49:05.060 --> 2:49:09.060]  But we're the bad guys apparently somehow.
[2:49:09.060 --> 2:49:15.060]  But that's just what you get from the left.
[2:49:15.060 --> 2:49:21.060]  In some news of the insane here this is these are both kind of funny in their own way.
[2:49:21.060 --> 2:49:27.060]  New York City garbage truck drags dining shed 10 feet with patrons inside.
[2:49:27.060 --> 2:49:33.060]  So if you haven't been to New York City recently it's it's sad to admit but it's basically just a dump.
[2:49:33.060 --> 2:49:40.060]  And with all the scaffolding and the trash on the streets and now all these weird outdoor dining facilities it's just it's just a mess.
[2:49:40.060 --> 2:49:50.060]  New York City is and so now they're dragging patrons trying to eat dinner folks literally I'm telling you like the streets of New York are just disgusting.
[2:49:50.060 --> 2:49:57.060]  Just just anywhere you go you're going to see mountains of trash everywhere you walk on the streets covered in scaffolding.
[2:49:57.060 --> 2:50:03.060]  Now you have all these these outdoor dining things set up because you can't eat inside.
[2:50:03.060 --> 2:50:09.060]  There's also protests happening all the time in fact let's real quickly go to a video of that.
[2:50:09.060 --> 2:50:17.060]  Let's go to guys roll clip 17 a Manhattan restaurant who forces you to show a vaccine pass to eat.
[2:50:17.060 --> 2:50:31.060]  They didn't go so well for them recently here it is.
[2:50:31.060 --> 2:50:39.060]  Okay so it went on the cops showed up they couldn't escort them out they then started chaining back the blue.
[2:50:39.060 --> 2:50:47.060]  And so this is this is just now look I wouldn't want to go to a restaurant that has a vaccine mandate anyway.
[2:50:47.060 --> 2:50:54.060]  So that's just a battle that I wouldn't be involved with but the people are resisting the COVID tyranny any which way they can.
[2:50:54.060 --> 2:50:59.060]  We also have the videos of the police basically refusing to escort them out and then the crowd chants back the blue.
[2:50:59.060 --> 2:51:03.060]  That's the that's the kinship we need with law enforcement right now.
[2:51:03.060 --> 2:51:10.060]  Here's another funny one for you.
[2:51:10.060 --> 2:51:18.060]  Drunk man spends hours helping search for missing person before realizing they were looking for him.
[2:51:18.060 --> 2:51:26.060]  Drunk Turkish man spends hours helping search party hunting for missing persons without realizing he's the missing person they're searching for.
[2:51:26.060 --> 2:51:41.060]  John Mootloo was drinking with friends when he wandered into the woods he was reported as missing stumbled across the search party searching for himself joined the search party searching for himself until they all figured out that he's the one they're searching for.
[2:51:41.060 --> 2:51:50.060]  Are we having fun yet are we having fun yet they're having fun in Turkey with the missing man searching for himself.
[2:51:50.060 --> 2:51:59.060]  We're having fun in New York City eating in an outside shed for for the unvaxxed masses and then getting drug off by a garbage truck.
[2:51:59.060 --> 2:52:02.060]  So we're we're having fun we're all having a good time.
[2:52:02.060 --> 2:52:08.060]  Silicon Valley is basically admitting they're trying to create God.
[2:52:08.060 --> 2:52:23.060]  Mr Gaudat is the Silicon Valley super geek who believes we face an apocalyptic threat from an artificial intelligence the former Google Super Mo tells you go Roth kind how a human tragedy shaped the way he sees the future and what we need to do next and yeah.
[2:52:23.060 --> 2:52:31.060]  It's all about they're creating this AI and who knows it you know will it become sentient or will it just make up decisions for itself will it launch nukes will purge the planet.
[2:52:31.060 --> 2:52:36.060]  How much power they giving it how much range does do they have on it.
[2:52:36.060 --> 2:52:39.060]  That's just Silicon Valley though.
[2:52:39.060 --> 2:52:42.060]  You know they're fine they love you so much.
[2:52:42.060 --> 2:52:47.060]  Let's go to Marjorie Taylor Green in clip one.
[2:52:47.060 --> 2:52:54.060]  She had an event in Georgia and boy Marjorie Taylor Green is really just taking the reins off if you will.
[2:52:54.060 --> 2:52:57.060]  And no censorship.
[2:52:57.060 --> 2:52:59.060]  She's not even censoring herself here.
[2:52:59.060 --> 2:53:11.060]  I think that it's a good thing. Hey you know politics is it can get nasty and so for so far so long and so far the Democrats have been the only ones that take low blows and play nasty Marjorie Taylor Green and haven't anymore.
[2:53:11.060 --> 2:53:16.060]  Here she was at an event in Georgia where she had a few words for Nancy Pelosi.
[2:53:16.060 --> 2:53:18.060]  I just want to say to Nancy Pelosi.
[2:53:18.060 --> 2:53:20.060]  She's a hypocrite.
[2:53:20.060 --> 2:53:22.060]  She's an anti-American.
[2:53:22.060 --> 2:53:26.060]  And we're going to kick that bitch out of Congress.
[2:53:26.060 --> 2:53:31.060]  Say it louder for the people in the back.
[2:53:31.060 --> 2:53:38.060]  And then the raucous applause.
[2:53:38.060 --> 2:53:43.060]  And you watch her campaign donations are just going to skyrocket.
[2:53:43.060 --> 2:53:49.060]  Because Republicans and conservatives and American patriots are sick of being bullied and pushed around by the left.
[2:53:49.060 --> 2:53:55.060]  And it's nice to see someone push back even if it is a little.
[2:53:55.060 --> 2:54:00.060]  I think it's perfectly fair considering everything the Democrats are doing to us.
[2:54:00.060 --> 2:54:04.060]  Here's a video out of Europe guys in clip two.
[2:54:04.060 --> 2:54:06.060]  This is all by design.
[2:54:06.060 --> 2:54:13.060]  This is the end of civilization as you know it into the new the COVID Tierney is just the introduction just the primary for the climate Tierney.
[2:54:13.060 --> 2:54:21.060]  Here's what it's going to look like just a taste of what the climate Tierney is going to look like from the UK in clip two.
[2:54:21.060 --> 2:54:25.060]  We warned of all the food shortages. We warned of all the fuel shortages.
[2:54:25.060 --> 2:54:27.060]  We warned of everything.
[2:54:27.060 --> 2:54:29.060]  Now there's no fuel in the UK.
[2:54:29.060 --> 2:54:33.060]  They are systematically inflating everything.
[2:54:33.060 --> 2:54:36.060]  This is a war against humanity.
[2:54:36.060 --> 2:54:37.060]  This is deliberate.
[2:54:37.060 --> 2:54:41.060]  This is from your governments and they are attacking us.
[2:54:41.060 --> 2:54:50.060]  See people just need to understand the world elite that believe they run and own this planet have decided there's no more use for you.
[2:54:50.060 --> 2:54:55.060]  You're being priced out you're being squeezed out you're being forced out of existence.
[2:54:55.060 --> 2:54:58.060]  That's been the determination and again I explained at the top of the show.
[2:54:58.060 --> 2:55:07.060]  They believe that they've had the awakening they have the science that hey there's X amount of resources on the world to give the humans X amount of time to live this lifestyle.
[2:55:07.060 --> 2:55:11.060]  There's too many humans the humans need to be called it's the only way to save humanity.
[2:55:11.060 --> 2:55:19.060]  That's what the world elite have decided and so they've just decided you're useless now they won't just open up and say it to your face in so many words and be honest.
[2:55:19.060 --> 2:55:26.060]  They'll kind of hint at it and throw it out there in their own nuanced ways but no that is the case absolutely.
[2:55:26.060 --> 2:55:29.060]  More protests are happening in New York City.
[2:55:29.060 --> 2:55:37.060]  Here was they seen from a night I mean every night with this now here's another scene from another protest in New York City last night.
[2:55:37.060 --> 2:55:55.060]  Hold on guys my bad play clip six.
[2:55:55.060 --> 2:56:08.060]  So it's just thousands of people in the streets every night in New York and the Alliance of Black Lives Matter and Trump supporters is becoming a real thing now to against the vaccine mandates.
[2:56:08.060 --> 2:56:10.060]  All right I want to play clip four real quick.
[2:56:10.060 --> 2:56:21.060]  Here's Kamala Harris visiting a school and a student who's obviously brainwashed by the liberal media says something and then what Kamala Harris says after that is really telling here it is clip four.
[2:56:21.060 --> 2:56:29.060]  I see that over the summer there have been like protests and demonstrations and astronomical numbers standing with House time.
[2:56:29.060 --> 2:56:40.060]  But then just a few days ago there were funds allocated to continue backing Israel which hurts my heart because it's ethnic genocide and the displacement of people the same that happened in America.
[2:56:40.060 --> 2:56:41.060]  And I'm sure you're aware of this.
[2:56:41.060 --> 2:56:43.060]  So she says it's an ethnic genocide.
[2:56:43.060 --> 2:56:48.060]  The Israel the Israel is running an ethnic ethnic genocide in the Middle East that student claims.
[2:56:48.060 --> 2:56:51.060]  And listen to Harris's response.
[2:56:51.060 --> 2:57:04.060]  George Mason University avoided at all costs.
[2:57:04.060 --> 2:57:12.060]  And notice Harris wears a mask when she's amongst the peasants to pretend like she's one of you because she makes you wear a mask.
[2:57:12.060 --> 2:57:17.060]  You're a good peasant.
[2:57:17.060 --> 2:57:23.060]  And again this is about the fact that your voice your perspective your experience your truth.
[2:57:23.060 --> 2:57:24.060]  There it is right there.
[2:57:24.060 --> 2:57:28.060]  Your truth your truth your truth.
[2:57:28.060 --> 2:57:30.060]  It doesn't matter if it's wrong.
[2:57:30.060 --> 2:57:33.060]  It doesn't matter that it's made up doesn't matter if it's fantasy land.
[2:57:33.060 --> 2:57:35.060]  It's your truth.
[2:57:35.060 --> 2:57:41.060]  Is this part of Kamala Harris's crisis of rebranding herself because she's so unpopular in a total phony.
[2:57:41.060 --> 2:57:47.060]  Hanging out with the peasants saying your truth even if it's a lie but it's your truth.
[2:57:47.060 --> 2:57:54.060]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the New World Order.
[2:57:54.060 --> 2:57:58.060]  And Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[2:57:58.060 --> 2:58:05.060]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers through the U.N.
[2:58:05.060 --> 2:58:18.060]  And they want inside your bodies to put in you what they want when they want and to have the global digital tracking covid passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone of their New World ID.
[2:58:18.060 --> 2:58:27.060]  And now their puppet bite has announced the forced inoculation of 100 million Americans to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[2:58:27.060 --> 2:58:32.060]  This is criminal and he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve it.
[2:58:32.060 --> 2:58:37.060]  They say that's a 20 25 maybe they just expanded the emergency authorization.
[2:58:37.060 --> 2:58:40.060]  That's why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
[2:58:40.060 --> 2:58:43.060]  Well you live to see an absolute new world order world government.
[2:58:43.060 --> 2:58:47.060]  If you submit they will totally enslave you.
[2:58:47.060 --> 2:58:49.060]  My business model is very very simple.
[2:58:49.060 --> 2:58:57.060]  I want to bring you products that work really really well and affordable prices that are competitive so that you'll shop with us.
[2:58:57.060 --> 2:59:04.060]  And so we form a relationship so we're able to stay on air and fight the globalist and have good products that make us healthy.
[2:59:04.060 --> 2:59:07.060]  Make us wiser that boost our immune system.
[2:59:07.060 --> 2:59:08.060]  And that's what we've done.
[2:59:08.060 --> 2:59:12.060]  Now one area of the immune system we don't talk enough about is deep restful sleep.
[2:59:12.060 --> 2:59:13.060]  Look it up for yourself.
[2:59:13.060 --> 2:59:16.060]  The effects of deep restful sleep on health and the immune system.
[2:59:16.060 --> 2:59:21.060]  And so with everything we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D and zinc and all of that's great.
[2:59:21.060 --> 2:59:25.060]  But deep restful sleep is just as important maybe more important.
[2:59:25.060 --> 2:59:34.060]  So infowarstore.com now can announce 50% off on our best selling product down and out that just came back in after four months being sold out.

[3:00:08.060 --> 3:00:14.060]  Our final segment for me and then Kate Daly takes over by the way there was an 18 year old.
[3:00:14.060 --> 3:00:18.060]  Mom who got shot by police in the head.
[3:00:18.060 --> 3:00:21.060]  She's now brain dead but you won't be hearing about her story.
[3:00:21.060 --> 3:00:22.060]  She was unarmed.
[3:00:22.060 --> 3:00:24.060]  You won't be hearing about her story.
[3:00:24.060 --> 3:00:26.060]  I bet you can guess why.
[3:00:26.060 --> 3:00:32.060]  Now here's Burgess Owens a great member of Congress one of the few great Americans we have in Congress.
[3:00:32.060 --> 3:00:34.060]  He is of course a Republican.
[3:00:34.060 --> 3:00:39.060]  He just gave this speech on the floor of Congress today and it really angered Democrats.
[3:00:39.060 --> 3:00:44.060]  You can hear them squealing and screeching as he delivers his speech to Congress.
[3:00:44.060 --> 3:00:45.060]  Here it was.
[3:00:45.060 --> 3:00:50.060]  I'd like to address comments made by my friend from Georgia on the other side.
[3:00:50.060 --> 3:00:54.060]  I think we're going to ever get to resolving the issues we have in the black community.
[3:00:54.060 --> 3:00:56.060]  We got to be honest with friends.
[3:00:56.060 --> 3:01:04.060]  We just heard that a pushback on the fact that we're getting black men in the black community not doing their job.
[3:01:04.060 --> 3:01:06.060]  Well let me give you the facts real quick.
[3:01:06.060 --> 3:01:13.060]  First of all, when I was growing up in the 60s, we let the country and then committed to marriage over 70%.
[3:01:13.060 --> 3:01:20.060]  Black women could rely on getting married more than white women until 1970.
[3:01:20.060 --> 3:01:25.060]  We now have between 70 to 80% of black fathers who deserve their families.
[3:01:25.060 --> 3:01:28.060]  And we're not willing to be honest about that.
[3:01:28.060 --> 3:01:32.060]  We're not willing to say that these guys need to man up.
[3:01:32.060 --> 3:01:40.060]  Maybe when we start telling our kids that they're being nothing but winters, wings, and wimps,
[3:01:40.060 --> 3:01:44.060]  if men cannot take care of their own kids, that might be a good start.
[3:01:44.060 --> 3:01:46.060]  I ain't reject the words of this gentleman.
[3:01:46.060 --> 3:01:48.060]  Mr. Chairman, I call for order.
[3:01:48.060 --> 3:01:49.060]  I call for order.
[3:01:49.060 --> 3:01:51.060]  We right now, the facts are in.
[3:01:51.060 --> 3:01:53.060]  Mr. Big says three times.
[3:01:53.060 --> 3:01:54.060]  The facts are in.
[3:01:54.060 --> 3:01:55.060]  Facts.
[3:01:55.060 --> 3:01:59.060]  Black fathers 70 to 80% are deserting their families.
[3:01:59.060 --> 3:02:02.060]  Talk to these black single women out there and see what they think about this.
[3:02:02.060 --> 3:02:08.060]  We sit in this little bubble where we're living the life, we're married, many of us,
[3:02:08.060 --> 3:02:12.060]  and we cannot be honest about what's happening in our urban communities.
[3:02:12.060 --> 3:02:15.060]  While these kids are growing up with no fathers, no examples,
[3:02:15.060 --> 3:02:23.060]  at the end of the day, there's a reason why our kids are being led toward these options of hopelessness.
[3:02:23.060 --> 3:02:28.060]  And for us to sit here in 2021, not right now, I'm sorry, let me just finish.
[3:02:28.060 --> 3:02:34.060]  To sit here in 2021 and not point out the fact that we have fatherless homes.
[3:02:34.060 --> 3:02:36.060]  We have 70 to 80%.
[3:02:36.060 --> 3:02:38.060]  These are the facts, my friends.
[3:02:38.060 --> 3:02:44.060]  70 to 80% will not marry the mothers of their children and instead will probably try to convince them
[3:02:44.060 --> 3:02:48.060]  to dissolve them from their issues to go and get an abortion.
[3:02:48.060 --> 3:02:53.060]  We've lost 20 million black babies over the last 40 years.
[3:02:53.060 --> 3:02:59.060]  40% of my race has been exterminated because we don't have men that will sit there and say,
[3:02:59.060 --> 3:03:00.060]  I'll take care of my kids.
[3:03:00.060 --> 3:03:01.060]  I'll protect my child.
[3:03:01.060 --> 3:03:03.060]  I'll make sure they grow up and get a good education.
[3:03:03.060 --> 3:03:09.060]  I'll make sure they're protected in my home and not leave it to their mother to do it on their own.
[3:03:09.060 --> 3:03:13.060]  And if we can't be honest about that, how in the world are we going to ever get this thing taken care of?
[3:03:13.060 --> 3:03:19.060]  I'll tell you what, you're going to start seeing black men that 30% are still left,
[3:03:19.060 --> 3:03:23.060]  they're really good solid fathers, we're standing up.
[3:03:23.060 --> 3:03:24.060]  What changes this trajectory?
[3:03:24.060 --> 3:03:25.060]  We're sick and tired.
[3:03:25.060 --> 3:03:31.060]  People looking at us as this is a normal thing that we just don't do our job as men.
[3:03:31.060 --> 3:03:36.060]  Be aware we're waking up and that's going to be a change in the coming years.
[3:03:36.060 --> 3:03:41.060]  We're going to start seeing black men really committed to their families, their kids, the mothers of their children.
[3:03:41.060 --> 3:03:45.060]  And being the productive Americans we were back when I was growing up.
[3:03:45.060 --> 3:03:50.060]  Well, Democrats don't want to see that because then they won't vote Democrat.
[3:03:50.060 --> 3:03:52.060]  Then they might vote Republican.
[3:03:52.060 --> 3:03:58.060]  Oh, and so you can hear the Democrats trying to shut down a black man from speaking there on Congress coughing into the microphone.
[3:03:58.060 --> 3:04:01.060]  Oh, I reject, I reject.
[3:04:01.060 --> 3:04:02.060]  So it's the Democrats.
[3:04:02.060 --> 3:04:10.060]  They tried to stop black men from being free during the Jim Crow era during the Civil War and they're still at it to this day.
[3:04:10.060 --> 3:04:13.060]  Really just amazing, but they claim they're the ones fighting racism.
[3:04:13.060 --> 3:04:15.060]  It's all just a front. It's all just posturing.
[3:04:15.060 --> 3:04:19.060]  All right, I'm handing the microphone over to Kate Daly.
[3:04:19.060 --> 3:04:22.060]  She'll be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the war room.
[3:04:22.060 --> 3:04:24.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, remember infowarstore.com.

[3:04:57.060 --> 3:05:02.060]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered?
[3:05:02.060 --> 3:05:05.060]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store?
[3:05:05.060 --> 3:05:11.060]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting?
[3:05:11.060 --> 3:05:19.060]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini-mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on?
[3:05:19.060 --> 3:05:21.060]  How far do you think that would get you?
[3:05:21.060 --> 3:05:27.060]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space alien?
[3:05:27.060 --> 3:05:34.060]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[3:05:34.060 --> 3:05:37.060]  The globalists are running a psychological war for operation on humanity.
[3:05:37.060 --> 3:05:41.060]  Only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us.
[3:05:41.060 --> 3:05:43.060]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[3:05:43.060 --> 3:05:49.060]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud, that it's dangerous, that it causes major medical issues, and it's dehumanizing.
[3:05:49.060 --> 3:05:51.060]  And the film COVID Land does that.

[3:06:07.060 --> 3:06:10.060]  Hi everybody, Kate Dally, your guest host today.
[3:06:10.060 --> 3:06:13.060]  And what a terrific show, my gosh.
[3:06:13.060 --> 3:06:15.060]  Well, I have a wonderful guest for you.
[3:06:15.060 --> 3:06:20.060]  So I'm really hoping you're going to stay on and listen to this because this is really pertinent information.
[3:06:20.060 --> 3:06:23.060]  Greg Manorino, the Robin Hood of Wall Street.
[3:06:23.060 --> 3:06:26.060]  I think it's been too long since I've had you on, Greg.
[3:06:26.060 --> 3:06:33.060]  And I'm really excited to be able to talk about the financial markets where we're headed and really the backdrop of what's going on.
[3:06:33.060 --> 3:06:40.060]  You are, to me, the guru, the guy, the one that usually always calls the shots and you know what you're doing.
[3:06:40.060 --> 3:06:42.060]  So I'm really happy to have you on.
[3:06:42.060 --> 3:06:46.060]  And traderschoice.net, if you don't know that site, well, you should.
[3:06:46.060 --> 3:06:47.060]  What can I say?
[3:06:47.060 --> 3:06:52.060]  Greg's been a guest on my show. He's also been on Alex's show too.
[3:06:52.060 --> 3:06:56.060]  And for a good reason, Greg Manorino, welcome.
[3:06:56.060 --> 3:06:57.060]  Thanks for having me.
[3:06:57.060 --> 3:06:58.060]  It's been a long time.
[3:06:58.060 --> 3:06:59.060]  Great to see you.
[3:06:59.060 --> 3:07:03.060]  Actually, it's been like a really long time, but I'm happy to be here really.
[3:07:03.060 --> 3:07:04.060]  There's so much going on.
[3:07:04.060 --> 3:07:06.060]  It's so freaking twisted.
[3:07:06.060 --> 3:07:07.060]  It's sick.
[3:07:07.060 --> 3:07:14.060]  Watching the last segment and, you know, I just sometimes I want to scream.
[3:07:14.060 --> 3:07:17.060]  I literally want to stick my head out this window and scream.
[3:07:17.060 --> 3:07:21.060]  And I think that a lot of people are getting, you know, that same kind of feeling.
[3:07:21.060 --> 3:07:22.060]  It's out of control.
[3:07:22.060 --> 3:07:30.060]  And I think it's all being done honestly to keep people in some kind of state of helplessness,
[3:07:30.060 --> 3:07:33.060]  learn helplessness, feeling like they can't do anything.
[3:07:33.060 --> 3:07:38.060]  This is a very unique environment in many, many ways.
[3:07:38.060 --> 3:07:43.060]  And I'm glad people are starting to pay freaking attention to this.
[3:07:43.060 --> 3:07:47.060]  And some people are just not going to get it, no matter what they hear.
[3:07:47.060 --> 3:07:50.060]  And some of us, I think, you know, we're going to get it.
[3:07:50.060 --> 3:07:51.060]  And I really believe this.
[3:07:51.060 --> 3:07:55.060]  And I've been saying for a long time, there is a natural selection going on right here.
[3:07:55.060 --> 3:08:01.060]  There are certain types of people who understand how important it is to have free thought,
[3:08:01.060 --> 3:08:03.060]  free action and free movement.
[3:08:03.060 --> 3:08:08.060]  And that's being stolen right from underneath everyone in this nation here.
[3:08:08.060 --> 3:08:09.060]  And some people are buying into it.
[3:08:09.060 --> 3:08:10.060]  Some people want it.
[3:08:10.060 --> 3:08:12.060]  Some people want to be controlled.
[3:08:12.060 --> 3:08:14.060]  They get off on being manipulated.
[3:08:14.060 --> 3:08:15.060]  They don't see it.
[3:08:15.060 --> 3:08:17.060]  They think it's just the normal thing.
[3:08:17.060 --> 3:08:22.060]  But the fact of the matter is, we are in a state of change in this nation.
[3:08:22.060 --> 3:08:26.060]  Something I wondered about would happen a very long time ago.
[3:08:26.060 --> 3:08:29.060]  You know, I cover a lot on my blog and my work.
[3:08:29.060 --> 3:08:31.060]  And it's not just the financial markets.
[3:08:31.060 --> 3:08:34.060]  It's really how this whole freak show plays together.
[3:08:34.060 --> 3:08:38.060]  And I just want people to understand they are really living in interesting times.
[3:08:38.060 --> 3:08:43.060]  And if we don't do something, we're just done.
[3:08:43.060 --> 3:08:45.060]  Well, my gosh, to me, okay.
[3:08:45.060 --> 3:08:49.060]  One of the first questions I have for you, Greg, is what is hitting you right off the bat?
[3:08:49.060 --> 3:08:52.060]  What is so obvious that you can't ignore right now?
[3:08:52.060 --> 3:08:55.060]  And I know there's multiple signs right now that we have never seen before.
[3:08:55.060 --> 3:08:59.060]  But what are some of those triggered events that you just, you are just thinking,
[3:08:59.060 --> 3:09:04.060]  oh my gosh, why are people not seeing what's happening with this market?
[3:09:04.060 --> 3:09:08.060]  Well, you know, the market and everything is just kind of ties together.
[3:09:08.060 --> 3:09:14.060]  I mean, you know, at a deeper level here, we were seeing the elimination of free thought,
[3:09:14.060 --> 3:09:17.060]  free action, and free movement.
[3:09:17.060 --> 3:09:19.060]  Like I just started off with earlier.
[3:09:19.060 --> 3:09:23.060]  And you know, look, the market is an entity among itself here.
[3:09:23.060 --> 3:09:29.060]  And it's being absolutely pulled in any direction that, you know,
[3:09:29.060 --> 3:09:31.060]  the big players wanted to go.
[3:09:31.060 --> 3:09:34.060]  I'm just trading the fake market. It's not real.
[3:09:34.060 --> 3:09:36.060]  There's no price action.
[3:09:36.060 --> 3:09:39.060]  There's no price discovery behind any asset anymore.
[3:09:39.060 --> 3:09:43.060]  It's so out of control that it's really hard to get your head around.
[3:09:43.060 --> 3:09:47.060]  And I study this thing 24-7.
[3:09:47.060 --> 3:09:51.060]  And that's why I may be kind of, you know, losing my mind a little bit here.
[3:09:51.060 --> 3:09:54.060]  But the fact of the matter is, what's hitting me with the market,
[3:09:54.060 --> 3:09:56.060]  I mean, we're in a hyperbobble.
[3:09:56.060 --> 3:09:58.060]  It's super out of control.
[3:09:58.060 --> 3:10:01.060]  And that's okay because it does present opportunity.
[3:10:01.060 --> 3:10:04.060]  And that's really what I try to do with my work is cut through it all.
[3:10:04.060 --> 3:10:06.060]  What can we all do?
[3:10:06.060 --> 3:10:11.060]  Understanding that this thing around us, you know, it's a shit show.
[3:10:11.060 --> 3:10:13.060]  It's a freak show.
[3:10:13.060 --> 3:10:17.060]  But at the same time, it presents opportunity for people who have an understanding,
[3:10:17.060 --> 3:10:18.060]  I guess, a little bit.
[3:10:18.060 --> 3:10:23.060]  All you need is a couple of functioning brain cells to get yourself on the right side of this.
[3:10:23.060 --> 3:10:26.060]  Because we're in the middle of something I said.
[3:10:26.060 --> 3:10:32.060]  I've been explaining to people that paradigm shift and new government philosophy,
[3:10:32.060 --> 3:10:38.060]  governments, this government, whatever, has now merged with the corporate agenda here.
[3:10:38.060 --> 3:10:40.060]  The definition of this is fascism.
[3:10:40.060 --> 3:10:42.060]  We all know that.
[3:10:42.060 --> 3:10:44.060]  And that's bleeding across the markets too.
[3:10:44.060 --> 3:10:50.060]  Creating an extreme two-tier society, a new feudal system, a new indoctrination.
[3:10:50.060 --> 3:10:53.060]  It's absolutely out of control.
[3:10:53.060 --> 3:10:58.060]  And yeah, that's what gets to me is I'm watching so many people, friends of mine,
[3:10:58.060 --> 3:11:01.060]  some of them very close friends are buying this.
[3:11:01.060 --> 3:11:03.060]  They're buying into what's going on.
[3:11:03.060 --> 3:11:09.060]  The narrative, the mainstream garbage, you know, the divide and conquer mechanism.
[3:11:09.060 --> 3:11:10.060]  They don't see it.
[3:11:10.060 --> 3:11:12.060]  They don't understand that they're being manipulated.
[3:11:12.060 --> 3:11:16.060]  It's always how it's been, but never to this degree before.
[3:11:16.060 --> 3:11:19.060]  And it is, it's troubling.
[3:11:19.060 --> 3:11:21.060]  There's just no doubt about it.
[3:11:21.060 --> 3:11:26.060]  One thing people love about you, Greg, is your ability at traderschoice.net
[3:11:26.060 --> 3:11:29.060]  to really lay it on the line and tell people what you're doing personally
[3:11:29.060 --> 3:11:31.060]  and what they can do to safeguard.
[3:11:31.060 --> 3:11:35.060]  So there's a lot of people with a lot of money out there on Wall Street
[3:11:35.060 --> 3:11:37.060]  trying to decide what to do with it.
[3:11:37.060 --> 3:11:38.060]  Do I take it out?
[3:11:38.060 --> 3:11:40.060]  Do I put it in gold and silver right now?
[3:11:40.060 --> 3:11:45.060]  Are we seeing so many signs that are so ominous that it's time?
[3:11:45.060 --> 3:11:49.060]  And I also want to get your thoughts on the crypto market too.
[3:11:49.060 --> 3:11:51.060]  Sure. Well, let's start off with this.
[3:11:51.060 --> 3:11:57.060]  Despite the narrative from the dog shit fake propaganda ministry,
[3:11:57.060 --> 3:12:03.060]  the mainstream outlets here, our economy is contracting at its fastest pace in history.
[3:12:03.060 --> 3:12:07.060]  As a percentage of GDP, we have never seen this before.
[3:12:07.060 --> 3:12:10.060]  It's rapid and it's crumbling around us.
[3:12:10.060 --> 3:12:18.060]  I mean, just like today, for example, we just found out that another 362,000 people applied for first time unemployment benefits last week.
[3:12:18.060 --> 3:12:20.060]  It's the same story every single week.
[3:12:20.060 --> 3:12:23.060]  The bad economic news does not stop.
[3:12:23.060 --> 3:12:27.060]  Deaths and deficits are hyper-exploding all by design here.
[3:12:27.060 --> 3:12:33.060]  But again, the propaganda ministry is trying to tell people everything is doing just fantastic and it's perfect and it's beautiful.
[3:12:33.060 --> 3:12:35.060]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[3:12:35.060 --> 3:12:43.060]  This has been going on for quite a long time and it's all in an effort to bring about a new society, a new mentality.
[3:12:43.060 --> 3:12:49.060]  Extreme haves, extreme have nots and that's just the way it's going to play out here.
[3:12:49.060 --> 3:12:53.060]  This is how the few have controlled the many for thousands of years.
[3:12:53.060 --> 3:12:56.060]  This kind of a mechanism that we're seeing right now, but never on such a grand scale.
[3:12:56.060 --> 3:12:59.060]  It's so bad today.
[3:12:59.060 --> 3:13:05.060]  I've been telling people this is the golden age for people that are well off and rich and everyone else is getting squashed.
[3:13:05.060 --> 3:13:11.060]  This is a grand elimination and I mean this, an extermination of the middle class.
[3:13:11.060 --> 3:13:26.060]  We're moving definitely into a new mode of thinking here and people are being programmed by the millions to fall into this new government system.
[3:13:26.060 --> 3:13:28.060]  It's very frightening to me.
[3:13:28.060 --> 3:13:30.060]  It really is.
[3:13:30.060 --> 3:13:33.060]  What was the second part of the question you asked?
[3:13:33.060 --> 3:13:42.060]  China crypto because a lot of people have questions about crypto. We know they're trying to move us into a digital currency completely. Absolutely no cash.
[3:13:42.060 --> 3:13:45.060]  What does that look like to you and what was China's move about?
[3:13:45.060 --> 3:13:52.060]  I know we only have a couple minutes before the break. We'll hit this hard again, but what was China's big move about in making that illegal?
[3:13:52.060 --> 3:14:05.060]  Well, imagine my shock here. You have a communist nation trying to take something away from people. Here's something that would give people the opportunity to transact outside of a central bank system.
[3:14:05.060 --> 3:14:07.060]  You've got to be kidding me.
[3:14:07.060 --> 3:14:11.060]  It's not going to make a difference in the long run in my view.
[3:14:11.060 --> 3:14:17.060]  I am a major crypto bull. Everybody knows that I own a lot of crypto. I own them all. All the big ones I own.
[3:14:17.060 --> 3:14:22.060]  I will continue to hold these things that have no intention of getting rid of them no matter what happens.
[3:14:22.060 --> 3:14:29.060]  I think people in China who now cannot transact because it's illegal encrypt those in any way sheet before we're going to find a way around it.
[3:14:29.060 --> 3:14:33.060]  They always do. Tell people they can't do something and they want to do it more.
[3:14:33.060 --> 3:14:38.060]  We could go on and on about this whole thing here, but I don't want people to worry.
[3:14:38.060 --> 3:14:51.060]  With regard to the market here, on my website, traderschoice.net, like you mentioned a few times, I created a new indicator. It's called the MMRI, Manorino Market Risk Indicator.
[3:14:51.060 --> 3:14:57.060]  You can go look at it and this tells people what they should be doing for the most part with regard to risk in this market.
[3:14:57.060 --> 3:15:04.060]  This just came out last week. It's 100% free. I want people to utilize this resource. All this stuff on my website is free.
[3:15:04.060 --> 3:15:08.060]  Again, I want people to pay it forward if you're benefiting from this information.
[3:15:08.060 --> 3:15:18.060]  That's really it. The game is going to remain risk-on. The stock market is a hyperbubble. You need to have some cryptocurrency in your portfolio, in my view.
[3:15:18.060 --> 3:15:22.060]  The space is not for everyone. That's the truth, but it is for me.
[3:15:22.060 --> 3:15:29.060]  I think a lot of people want to be outside the freaking rigged system, and that's a way to do it.
[3:15:29.060 --> 3:15:35.060]  So true. My guest is Greg Manorino, the Robin Hood of Wall Street. The website is traderschoice.net.
[3:15:35.060 --> 3:15:44.060]  You can go to kdallyradio.com for more information. Greg and I will be right back to discuss what you need to do, what you can do to protect yourself.
[3:15:44.060 --> 3:15:48.060]  What's coming next? What does he perceive in the market, and what should you be aware of?
[3:15:48.060 --> 3:15:59.060]  So much good information today. I really hope you're hanging on for this. Be right back.
[3:16:18.060 --> 3:16:31.060]  Hey, everybody. Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too.
[3:16:31.060 --> 3:16:38.060]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:38.060 --> 3:16:45.060]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death. You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[3:16:45.060 --> 3:16:55.060]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:55.060 --> 3:17:02.060]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com. No cures or treatments there.
[3:17:02.060 --> 3:17:11.060]  Instead, little-known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10x.

[3:17:26.060 --> 3:17:31.060]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:31.060 --> 3:17:35.060]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:35.060 --> 3:17:41.060]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:17:41.060 --> 3:17:47.060]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:47.060 --> 3:17:56.060]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:17:56.060 --> 3:18:08.060]  You want to have a double-blind, randomized placebo testing without what that means. You give 20,000 people the vaccine when it comes to phase two, phase three trials,
[3:18:08.060 --> 3:18:16.060]  and you give 20,000 people a placebo, and then you really look at health outcomes for a long period of time, not four weeks.
[3:18:16.060 --> 3:18:24.060]  There's a lot of these injuries, the autoimmune injuries you're not going to see in four weeks, the cancer you're not going to see in four weeks,
[3:18:24.060 --> 3:18:32.060]  and many of the neurological injuries you won't see for four weeks. If the experience with other vaccines is instructive,
[3:18:32.060 --> 3:18:41.060]  you look at the other vaccines that are currently in the schedule, and there's about 400 injuries, illnesses, chronic illnesses that are listed.
[3:18:41.060 --> 3:18:50.060]  Robert Kennedy Jr. is just one of more than 40 powerful voices in the film COVID Land, exclusively available at covidland.com.

[3:20:14.060 --> 3:20:20.060]  Hi, I'm Kaye Dally, your guest host today, and what a terrific show. Wow.
[3:20:20.060 --> 3:20:26.060]  I'll tell you something. I've had Greg on my show, and he's been amazing. Everybody loves him because he's just so transparent.
[3:20:26.060 --> 3:20:30.060]  He's just honest, and he'll just tell you exactly what he's doing in the market, a former physician.
[3:20:30.060 --> 3:20:38.060]  He is now the Robin Hood of Wall Street, as we call him, and then also traderschoice.net.
[3:20:38.060 --> 3:20:44.060]  I rely on Greg for a lot of great information when it comes to, hey, you might want to be aware of this or that,
[3:20:44.060 --> 3:20:48.060]  and I've even taken Greg's advice, and that's why I wanted to have you on the show today,
[3:20:48.060 --> 3:20:51.060]  and I'm really excited that you're here, Greg, Greg Manorino.
[3:20:51.060 --> 3:20:57.060]  A friend came to me and said, hey, I just sold a house. A lot of people are doing this. They're killing the market, right?
[3:20:57.060 --> 3:21:03.060]  They're able to recoup a lot of money. Got $100,000. I don't know what to do with it.
[3:21:03.060 --> 3:21:10.060]  What's the safest thing right now with all of the turmoil happening, and what we know this king fraught a lot in Hormalla
[3:21:10.060 --> 3:21:16.060]  and everything they're going to be bringing on as the puppetry of what we know is going on from the deep state?
[3:21:16.060 --> 3:21:20.060]  What do I do with it? What do you tell somebody like that? It's a basic question for you,
[3:21:20.060 --> 3:21:26.060]  because I know that you're in this 24-7, probably very basic, but what would you tell somebody like that?
[3:21:26.060 --> 3:21:30.060]  What would you do with that kind of cash?
[3:21:30.060 --> 3:21:38.060]  You've got to stay hedged. How do I sleep at night by understanding the dynamics of the market, what's going on,
[3:21:38.060 --> 3:21:49.060]  and keeping myself and those that follow my work in such a way that they really don't care which way the market goes to a certain degree.
[3:21:49.060 --> 3:21:57.060]  Understanding the current environment is key. We have a runaway central bank who is the real government,
[3:21:57.060 --> 3:22:04.060]  and they are running the entire show. They are issuing debt through one door. They're buying it back through another door.
[3:22:04.060 --> 3:22:13.060]  This has inflated a massive hyper-debt bubble. The largest Frankenstein monster in the history of the world.
[3:22:13.060 --> 3:22:19.060]  We've never seen anything like it before, and this is all by design. Again, what is the Fed trying to do?
[3:22:19.060 --> 3:22:28.060]  We'll answer that question a little more in depth in a moment. The Fed is fulfilling their end game, their final solution.
[3:22:28.060 --> 3:22:36.060]  That is, to one day become the lender and buyer of a last resort. With this whole thing and the scandamic connected to it,
[3:22:36.060 --> 3:22:43.060]  we were told from a long time ago that something like this would be used on the world to shut down the global economies,
[3:22:43.060 --> 3:22:50.060]  which would allow central banks to finish what they started a long time ago to become the controlling power of the world.
[3:22:50.060 --> 3:22:55.060]  Understanding this mechanism means the stock market, again, is going to continue higher until it doesn't.
[3:22:55.060 --> 3:23:03.060]  Use that indicator I was explaining, the MMRI, that's right on my website, TraceChoice.net. You've got to be along the market.
[3:23:03.060 --> 3:23:09.060]  There are several places to be in. Number one, you've got to let the market pay you to own stocks.
[3:23:09.060 --> 3:23:19.060]  For example, I own big companies that pay a dividend. I am paid per share to own their stock in a market that keeps going higher.
[3:23:19.060 --> 3:23:27.060]  It's going to continue higher until it doesn't. We can use that indicator I was explaining to you a moment ago to gauge where the market is going to go.
[3:23:27.060 --> 3:23:35.060]  We can look at the 10-year yield. We can look at the dollar index. We can look at crude oil. A lot of things.
[3:23:35.060 --> 3:23:40.060]  You've got to be along the market. You've got to be also thinking what's going to happen when the market rolls over.
[3:23:40.060 --> 3:23:45.060]  Right now, the market remains risk-on. It's very simple. Risk-on meaning cash going into equities.
[3:23:45.060 --> 3:23:50.060]  It's going to roll over at one point to risk-off. We've seen this before. The market runs in cycles.
[3:23:50.060 --> 3:24:01.060]  Risk-on, risk-off, risk-off, risk-off. Risk-off assets, for example, would be things like physical gold, more importantly, physical silver,
[3:24:01.060 --> 3:24:05.060]  which I believe is the most undivided asset in the history of the world. How can people gauge that?
[3:24:05.060 --> 3:24:14.060]  How can people tell that Greg Manarino is correct in his assumption or his statement that physical silver is the most undivided asset?
[3:24:14.060 --> 3:24:21.060]  Very simple. Just go to your search engine, look up the Dow Gold Ratio and then the Gold Silver Ratio.
[3:24:21.060 --> 3:24:24.060]  If you look up these things historically, you will see what I'm saying is true.
[3:24:24.060 --> 3:24:30.060]  I also think that people need to be in cryptocurrencies. What's going to happen is very simple. It's very, very simple.
[3:24:30.060 --> 3:24:36.060]  The debt market is a hyperbubble. The debt market is going to implode by design at one particular time.
[3:24:36.060 --> 3:24:43.060]  It's going to burst. When the debt bubble bursts, in the same way suppressed rates have allowed a hyperbubble to develop in the stock market,
[3:24:43.060 --> 3:24:48.060]  it's going to reverse. You're going to get a massive sell-off in the debt market. Rates are going to spike rapidly.
[3:24:48.060 --> 3:24:52.060]  That's going to put a lot of pressure on the stock market. What's that going to do?
[3:24:52.060 --> 3:25:02.060]  Kesha is going to leave both the debt market and the stock market and just simply move from one asset class into other asset classes.
[3:25:02.060 --> 3:25:11.060]  I believe these asset classes are going to be suppressed ones. For example, hard assets like I just said, Gold, Silver, I think Platinum and Platinum.
[3:25:11.060 --> 3:25:18.060]  I also think cryptocurrencies as well. I don't care what they're trying to do with regulation, but they go out to cryptos right now, especially China.
[3:25:18.060 --> 3:25:25.060]  I don't think it's going to affect cryptos in the longer run. Anything can happen in the short run with any asset.
[3:25:25.060 --> 3:25:32.060]  They can be very volatile, but this is how you protect yourself from every single angle. You understand what's going on?
[3:25:32.060 --> 3:25:39.060]  You take in the big picture. I'm a macro guy. I look at everything as a whole and then I start to laser in on what needs to be done here.
[3:25:39.060 --> 3:25:48.060]  I think it's a very simple, very straightforward strategy to beat the market no matter what happens. This is how I can sleep.
[3:25:48.060 --> 3:25:54.060]  If you're so inclined, you can trade the market. You can sell options onto the market. That's what I'm doing now.
[3:25:54.060 --> 3:26:02.060]  I'm in that seller of options. I don't like to buy options anymore. The market is such a twisted place.
[3:26:02.060 --> 3:26:08.060]  I want people to consider this. What I do when I sell options onto the market, I'm selling options I don't even own.
[3:26:08.060 --> 3:26:15.060]  It's called naked. I'm selling options naked. I'm selling something I don't own. I want you to think about that.
[3:26:15.060 --> 3:26:24.060]  This is what's going on here. Anyone can do it. This is no big secret. I've been doing this repeatedly over and over, rolling over every single month.
[3:26:24.060 --> 3:26:31.060]  Everything I'm doing is right on my website, tradeschoice.net. My particular positions I'm in there is all there.
[3:26:31.060 --> 3:26:40.060]  I want people to capitalize on this. It's really what I really want them to do by understanding what's happening around them and not just in the financial markets.
[3:26:40.060 --> 3:26:52.060]  Everything connected to it because nothing is what it seems to be. This is much, much bigger. This is a takeover by central banks around the world who literally have become the governments of the world
[3:26:52.060 --> 3:27:00.060]  and they're fulfilling their endgame to become the lenders and buyers of last resort and everything else. Everything is just theater.
[3:27:00.060 --> 3:27:09.060]  Absolutely. In fact, the great reset is really all these corporations, all these investment firms giving to now new sustainable, I hate that word,
[3:27:09.060 --> 3:27:20.060]  sustainable green energy, gender, gender neutral, anybody that adopts that gets the cash, anybody that doesn't won't get that and they can't grow.
[3:27:20.060 --> 3:27:27.060]  And so you're watching this, I know, and you're looking at the markets. And so when you're putting money in, and I know we have about a minute and a half,
[3:27:27.060 --> 3:27:39.060]  but we'll come back after the break, certainly. But as far as crypto goes, as far as where you're putting cash, how much of your, how much of the portfolio should be now invested in crypto?
[3:27:39.060 --> 3:27:47.060]  Because we know that digital currency is going to be, is obviously the monster, right? Obviously something you should invest in. What percentage?
[3:27:47.060 --> 3:27:59.060]  I mean, that depends on a lot of things, too. If you're a high risk guy, like myself, I think it should be a large percentage. If you're someone, for example, that doesn't have a lot of money to play with,
[3:27:59.060 --> 3:28:08.060]  or someone that's worried about what's going to happen to the seal of kids the deal, nobody should ever play with scared money.
[3:28:08.060 --> 3:28:19.060]  The moment you start putting cash to work in any asset that you're afraid, or that the market's going to roll over, or you might lose, you know, you're playing with rent money or whatever it might be.
[3:28:19.060 --> 3:28:29.060]  You know, that's when people are going to make bad decisions here in the market here. And again, if you are a high risk guy who's not someone that's not risk averse,
[3:28:29.060 --> 3:28:38.060]  you know, of course, you should be more invested in risky assets. But if you're looking for stability, it's really difficult to find here right now.
[3:28:38.060 --> 3:28:45.060]  Again, we got, we got metals under pressure. We know who's rigging the market. We'll talk more about this after the break. Actually, why don't we do that?
[3:28:45.060 --> 3:28:48.060]  We'll save, but we'll save the best for last.
[3:28:48.060 --> 3:28:55.060]  My guest, Greg Manorito, the Robinville Wall Street will be right back, traderschoice.net. I'd be a part of that if I were you. Be right back.
[3:28:55.060 --> 3:29:04.060]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly,
[3:29:04.060 --> 3:29:12.060]  for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth. And then we're all this together. And I, you know, it gets old having to come to you and say,
[3:29:12.060 --> 3:29:19.060]  hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air. But it's true, we're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:29:19.060 --> 3:29:26.060]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups.
[3:29:26.060 --> 3:29:33.060]  And we're still here. And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility's going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:29:33.060 --> 3:29:39.060]  That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America's still quasi-free.
[3:29:39.060 --> 3:29:44.060]  You can't have info wars has been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:29:44.060 --> 3:29:51.060]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all, and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts,
[3:29:51.060 --> 3:29:55.060]  supplements and so much more. They're wonderful products, and they support the M4. Thank you.
[3:29:55.060 --> 3:30:03.060]  I got some good news. All the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:03.060 --> 3:30:10.060]  The bad news is, a lot of them are about to sell out. So this sale's only going from one week starting on September 29th.
[3:30:10.060 --> 3:30:17.060]  And in the case of green fiber capsules, these will be sold out in just a couple days, 50% off.
[3:30:17.060 --> 3:30:23.060]  We have knockout sleep aid, 50% off. Sold out for months, very popular, twice as strong as knockout.
[3:30:23.060 --> 3:30:29.060]  Probably too strong for some people. Totally different formula. Down and out is back in stock, 50% off.
[3:30:29.060 --> 3:30:36.060]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12, 50% off, and also on Deep Earth Crystal iodine, Survival Selective.
[3:30:36.060 --> 3:30:41.060]  It's all 40 to 50% off for one week only. Take advantage of it and fund the infowar.
[3:30:41.060 --> 3:30:48.060]  And I thank you all for your support, infowarstore.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:30:48.060 --> 3:30:53.060]  It's a win-win. These are things that make you healthy, make your life better, and they fund the infowar.
[3:30:53.060 --> 3:30:56.060]  Again, all we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[3:30:56.060 --> 3:31:03.060]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[3:31:03.060 --> 3:31:09.060]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[3:31:09.060 --> 3:31:14.060]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades
[3:31:14.060 --> 3:31:19.060]  to get ready for this, to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong. We're incredible.
[3:31:19.060 --> 3:31:23.060]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:31:23.060 --> 3:31:29.060]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential,
[3:31:29.060 --> 3:31:34.060]  and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting infowars
[3:31:34.060 --> 3:31:39.060]  by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family,
[3:31:39.060 --> 3:31:46.060]  and they're also funding our operation. Infowarstore.com. Infowarstore.com is incredible.
[3:31:46.060 --> 3:31:51.060]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobes, and others.
[3:31:51.060 --> 3:31:56.060]  So get them today at infowarstore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[3:31:56.060 --> 3:32:02.060]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems of these employees
[3:32:02.060 --> 3:32:09.060]  because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be,
[3:32:09.060 --> 3:32:13.060]  you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[3:32:13.060 --> 3:32:19.060]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale. That taxes the heart. It taxes the lungs.
[3:32:19.060 --> 3:32:27.060]  And we have given people heart attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth and nose covered with absolutely no regulation,
[3:32:27.060 --> 3:32:30.060]  no oversight, no medical oversight.
[3:32:30.060 --> 3:32:34.060]  The globalists have told us we're a disease. They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[3:32:34.060 --> 3:32:39.060]  And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up to one-third
[3:32:39.060 --> 3:32:43.060]  and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[3:32:43.060 --> 3:32:50.060]  This is a sick cult, and we've got to say no. But the only way the real science comes out of the public is if we tell them,
[3:32:50.060 --> 3:33:16.060]  get your copy today of COVIDland and expose them. It's covidland.com. Go there now.
[3:33:16.060 --> 3:33:21.060]  OK, Dali here, your guest host for the hour. And what an hour. You really need to pay attention to Greg Manorino,
[3:33:21.060 --> 3:33:26.060]  the Robin Hood of Wall Street. I pay close attention to what Greg says, as many people do.
[3:33:26.060 --> 3:33:32.060]  TradersChoice.net is the website that you need to join and get some advice on what happens next with the markets
[3:33:32.060 --> 3:33:36.060]  and things to be aware of. And I've seen warnings, Greg, coming from the Fed.
[3:33:36.060 --> 3:33:40.060]  Is this the first time we've seen warnings like we're seeing?
[3:33:40.060 --> 3:33:46.060]  I don't remember the last time I've seen things. It seems a little scary what's coming from the Fed
[3:33:46.060 --> 3:33:55.060]  in a warning that things are about to go very, very crazy. What is your perspective on that?
[3:33:55.060 --> 3:34:00.060]  Well, what are they doing here? They're trying to create more of the same fear.
[3:34:00.060 --> 3:34:05.060]  Again, make people afraid of one thing, one, and you can control their minds.
[3:34:05.060 --> 3:34:10.060]  Our job is to cut through it all and understand what they're trying to do to us
[3:34:10.060 --> 3:34:15.060]  by manipulating our thought process, by keeping people afraid. This is what they've done clearly
[3:34:15.060 --> 3:34:20.060]  with this whole covid scandemic and everything connected to it.
[3:34:20.060 --> 3:34:24.060]  Make people afraid and they're done. They just curl up into a little ball.
[3:34:24.060 --> 3:34:29.060]  They become paralyzed and they don't act. So what are they talking about here?
[3:34:29.060 --> 3:34:33.060]  We're up against this debt ceiling right now. Did you know that we're the richest country on Earth
[3:34:33.060 --> 3:34:37.060]  but we're about to run out of money? How does that work?
[3:34:37.060 --> 3:34:42.060]  With the largest detonation in the history of the world, every president in succession
[3:34:42.060 --> 3:34:45.060]  must borrow more than the last. They can't tell you this.
[3:34:45.060 --> 3:34:49.060]  They must allow the essential bank to create more debt out of thin air
[3:34:49.060 --> 3:34:57.060]  just to support the current environment. Without the debt expanding exponentially every day,
[3:34:57.060 --> 3:35:03.060]  we turn into Mad Max. This entire thing implodes as the debt-based economic model
[3:35:03.060 --> 3:35:06.060]  which demands that cash be borrowed into existence in greater and greater amounts
[3:35:06.060 --> 3:35:09.060]  and it cannot stop. The debt is never meant to be paid back.
[3:35:09.060 --> 3:35:15.060]  The debt is only meant to be expanded on. This whole show theater that we're seeing right now
[3:35:15.060 --> 3:35:20.060]  is about expanding the debt even further than it's already been expanded.
[3:35:20.060 --> 3:35:24.060]  It's out of control here. Just look at the last few presidents.
[3:35:24.060 --> 3:35:28.060]  You can see how many trillions of dollars they have added to the national debt here
[3:35:28.060 --> 3:35:30.060]  and you think this is by actually, they can't tell people.
[3:35:30.060 --> 3:35:35.060]  You see, no sitting president, okay, who they are, can allow people to understand the mechanism,
[3:35:35.060 --> 3:35:39.060]  how it actually works. They know. Members of Congress know.
[3:35:39.060 --> 3:35:44.060]  But they're not allowed to show they don't want to because their bosses are telling them not to
[3:35:44.060 --> 3:35:50.060]  share the information with the actual people who are being destroyed by this very system.
[3:35:50.060 --> 3:35:54.060]  The system today is, again, it's so twisted and so out of control.
[3:35:54.060 --> 3:35:58.060]  So what are they going to do? They got to create anxiety. They got to create fear.
[3:35:58.060 --> 3:36:03.060]  We have Janet Yellen over the last couple of trading days explaining about a catastrophe.
[3:36:03.060 --> 3:36:10.060]  You got Jamie Dimon from the CEO of JPMorgan explaining the same kind of thing,
[3:36:10.060 --> 3:36:13.060]  collapse, a meltdown of this and people are afraid.
[3:36:13.060 --> 3:36:17.060]  People remember what happened to them last time with regard to the market,
[3:36:17.060 --> 3:36:21.060]  with regard to housing prices, so they don't know what to do. So they're paralyzed.
[3:36:21.060 --> 3:36:24.060]  And again, it's just a game that they're playing to keep people of balance.
[3:36:24.060 --> 3:36:28.060]  It's the same thing that they always do because most people are very easily manipulated
[3:36:28.060 --> 3:36:35.060]  and they understand that people are sitting there stuck watching the program device
[3:36:35.060 --> 3:36:40.060]  in their living room, getting literally programmed, being made to be afraid of things.
[3:36:40.060 --> 3:36:43.060]  It drives me crazy. It really, really does. No.
[3:36:43.060 --> 3:36:47.060]  The moment you become afraid is the moment you lose. So what we do is we sit back
[3:36:47.060 --> 3:36:50.060]  and we just try to take this whole thing and realize what we need to do.
[3:36:50.060 --> 3:36:54.060]  So good. Let them play their games. The debt is in hyperbubble. We know that.
[3:36:54.060 --> 3:36:57.060]  At one particular point, this debt is going to become a major issue.
[3:36:57.060 --> 3:37:00.060]  We're just starting to see inflation, although they're telling us it was initially what?
[3:37:00.060 --> 3:37:07.060]  Powell, the Fed chair, it was not widespread. It was contained. It's transitory.
[3:37:07.060 --> 3:37:11.060]  Now a fine guy, guess what? It's not so contained. It is widespread.
[3:37:11.060 --> 3:37:15.060]  And it's not transitory. Everything, they're feeding the people.
[3:37:15.060 --> 3:37:19.060]  They're fist feeding people lie after lie after lie.
[3:37:19.060 --> 3:37:24.060]  And people are getting used to it. Tell people a little bit of truth, like a show like yours.
[3:37:24.060 --> 3:37:27.060]  Tell them this much truth and they hate your guts for it.
[3:37:27.060 --> 3:37:33.060]  They don't want to hear it. People are so used to being lied to that they just embrace it.
[3:37:33.060 --> 3:37:37.060]  That's what they want. They become slaves to the system. Again, that's what they want to.
[3:37:37.060 --> 3:37:42.060]  So what we need to do is understand the mechanism, realize what they're doing,
[3:37:42.060 --> 3:37:45.060]  and then keep ourselves in the right spot. It's not hard.
[3:37:45.060 --> 3:37:49.060]  Like I was explaining to you, you got $100,000. You want to be in the market, believe it or not.
[3:37:49.060 --> 3:37:53.060]  You want to be, you know, don't trade this market because you'll be trading.
[3:37:53.060 --> 3:37:56.060]  You'll be swimming with sharks if you don't know what you're doing.
[3:37:56.060 --> 3:38:00.060]  So, but, you know, the best thing to do would be maybe, you know,
[3:38:00.060 --> 3:38:05.060]  planning on what's coming down the pike, which is a complete meltdown of the current market system,
[3:38:05.060 --> 3:38:09.060]  which cannot be sustained. We're in a hyperbubble in debt. The stock market's a hyperbubble.
[3:38:09.060 --> 3:38:13.060]  They reinflated a housing bubble. This is all by design, the Federal Reserve,
[3:38:13.060 --> 3:38:18.060]  creating distortions across the spectrum of asset classes, unlike anything we've ever seen before,
[3:38:18.060 --> 3:38:22.060]  but there lies the opportunity. Understand that the market is a hyperbubble.
[3:38:22.060 --> 3:38:24.060]  It's going to burst one day. What are we going to do?
[3:38:24.060 --> 3:38:28.060]  What are people like Greg Manarino going to do when the market starts to melt down?
[3:38:28.060 --> 3:38:31.060]  Well, I'm going to short it, which means I'm going to bet against it.
[3:38:31.060 --> 3:38:36.060]  Just like the Wall Street banks, they're going to do Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan.
[3:38:36.060 --> 3:38:41.060]  I'm going to do the same thing. I run my blog like a fund manager is really what I do.
[3:38:41.060 --> 3:38:45.060]  And I tell everyone what I'm doing so they should maybe follow along.
[3:38:45.060 --> 3:38:48.060]  And at the same time here, again, we're going to get a wealth transfer,
[3:38:48.060 --> 3:38:51.060]  which is already happening on an unbelievable scale.
[3:38:51.060 --> 3:38:57.060]  We're going to see cash move into suppressed assets, gold, silver, platinum, palladium,
[3:38:57.060 --> 3:39:01.060]  I think crude oil, other commodities, cryptocurrencies as well.
[3:39:01.060 --> 3:39:03.060]  This is how I see it playing out moving forward.
[3:39:03.060 --> 3:39:06.060]  So understanding all that just makes it easy. Good.
[3:39:06.060 --> 3:39:09.060]  Let them let them spread their fear there, whatever they got to do.
[3:39:09.060 --> 3:39:15.060]  We're not going to be afraid. We're going to use this as a weapon against those that want to make us afraid.
[3:39:15.060 --> 3:39:20.060]  Good. Let them play their game. We will play ours period the end.
[3:39:20.060 --> 3:39:26.060]  Absolutely. I don't know of another trader that I trust that understands the deep state as well as you do.
[3:39:26.060 --> 3:39:31.060]  You talk about a lot. You tube censoring now and I can't believe all of the, well, you know what?
[3:39:31.060 --> 3:39:37.060]  I do believe because they were actually propped up with us with Incutel and CIA money and everything else.
[3:39:37.060 --> 3:39:40.060]  All of it's part of government. They're all government. They're not private businesses.
[3:39:40.060 --> 3:39:49.060]  So knowing what's coming, knowing how fast and swift this fraud fraudulent administration is moving.
[3:39:49.060 --> 3:39:55.060]  What do you see next six months because you are so good at looking ahead and saying, I think this is coming next.
[3:39:55.060 --> 3:40:00.060]  I think this is exactly what's on the horizon. What would you say next six months look like?
[3:40:00.060 --> 3:40:07.060]  I think we're going to see more mind twisting number one from the mainstream propaganda channels.
[3:40:07.060 --> 3:40:16.060]  They're going to convince, try to convince people sincerely and they're doing already that what people are seeing and witnessing for themselves is not true.
[3:40:16.060 --> 3:40:19.060]  That's what they're going to do. It's what they always do.
[3:40:19.060 --> 3:40:25.060]  So I'm going to expect another campaign here and I talked about this recently.
[3:40:25.060 --> 3:40:32.060]  It's going to happen. They're going to start talking about and they're trying to convince people right now with what they're seeing is not real, but it's out of control.
[3:40:32.060 --> 3:40:42.060]  And the thing is what worries me is there are some people that are so locked into this, they can't think again, no free thought, no free action, no free movie.
[3:40:42.060 --> 3:40:46.060]  You're not allowed to think for yourself. You're not allowed to express your own opinion anymore.
[3:40:46.060 --> 3:40:53.060]  That's completely out of control. You must fall in line. You must conform, conform, conform.
[3:40:53.060 --> 3:41:03.060]  This fascist communist mentality has really gripped, I think, a large portion of the population because they want to be taken care of from cradle to grave.
[3:41:03.060 --> 3:41:11.060]  They're struggling. They're struggling by design so they can go to mother government and say, which is the central banks and the fed, please help me.
[3:41:11.060 --> 3:41:19.060]  So they're willing to accept anything while, again, look at our senators, look at all these people.
[3:41:19.060 --> 3:41:26.060]  They're all multi-millionaires for the most part here. They don't practice anything that they preach. They're talking about equality.
[3:41:26.060 --> 3:41:33.060]  It's never going to be like that. It's just an agenda. Again, it's a distraction in so many ways.
[3:41:33.060 --> 3:41:41.060]  So you're going to see more of that, more distraction, more look here, don't look here, but don't let this phase you.
[3:41:41.060 --> 3:41:49.060]  You've got to kind of put that all aside. If you're looking at this from a perspective of what you can do for yourself from a financial standpoint,
[3:41:49.060 --> 3:41:55.060]  you've got to push it all aside. You've got to understand what's going on, realize the mechanism that's going on,
[3:41:55.060 --> 3:42:04.060]  and then make decisions for yourself without fear so they will be the correct ones moving forward.
[3:42:04.060 --> 3:42:13.060]  They want people broke, destitute, worried, struggling. This is how they control their minds. This is how they become slaves to the system.
[3:42:13.060 --> 3:42:21.060]  So people like you, people like me who maybe have a few, and people that are listening, I'm sure, have a few functioning brain cells.
[3:42:21.060 --> 3:42:27.060]  They are a direct threat. And there's also the threat that maybe we're going to start talking to some other people.
[3:42:27.060 --> 3:42:32.060]  Maybe we'll tell people to watch shows like yours. Maybe they'll understand, whoa, hold on a minute here.
[3:42:32.060 --> 3:42:41.060]  Something else is going on. That's why they're trying to shut us down. Period then. I think you and I are literally going to go extinct soon.
[3:42:41.060 --> 3:42:51.060]  There you go. Greg Manorino, Robin Hood of Wall Street, TradersChoice.net. You must follow him on Facebook. He says things that other people won't say.
[3:42:51.060 --> 3:43:12.060]  Love you, Greg. Thank you. Thank you.
[3:43:21.060 --> 3:43:27.060]  We are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[3:43:27.060 --> 3:43:34.060]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:43:34.060 --> 3:43:39.060]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:43:39.060 --> 3:43:46.060]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[3:43:46.060 --> 3:43:54.060]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless.
[3:44:16.060 --> 3:44:25.060]  So what did I do? I went to the developers and I said, make a totally different formula with a lot of other known natural healthy compounds that make you sleep deep and restful because that's what helps your immune system.
[3:44:25.060 --> 3:44:33.060]  And I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout. Okay, be careful when you take it. It's incredibly strong. It's named down and out.
[3:44:33.060 --> 3:44:38.060]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it, but it is extremely strong. We are extremely proud of it.
[3:44:38.060 --> 3:44:50.060]  It is exclusively available at infowarstore.com 50% off right now sold out for more than four months. Now back at stock, get your down and out and your knockout at infowarstore.com today.
[3:44:50.060 --> 3:45:09.060]  I thank you for your support because it keeps us on the air.
[3:45:21.060 --> 3:45:29.060]  Get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[3:45:29.060 --> 3:45:35.060]  I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[3:45:35.060 --> 3:45:46.060]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[3:45:46.060 --> 3:45:57.060]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God. Thank you so much.
[3:46:17.060 --> 3:46:27.060]  How far do you think that would get you? Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space alien?
[3:46:27.060 --> 3:46:56.060]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[3:46:58.060 --> 3:47:02.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:02.060 --> 3:47:21.060]  Hi, I'm Kate Dally, your guest host, and I want to cover some things. By the way, thank you, Greg Manorino, Robin Hood of Wall Street.
[3:47:21.060 --> 3:47:28.060]  He's fantastic. You should follow him. He's given us a lot of great ideas on what to invest in next and he's fantastic.
[3:47:28.060 --> 3:47:35.060]  I really appreciate that he understands what's going on with the Deep State, King Fraud a lot, Kamala, Kamala, what is her name?
[3:47:35.060 --> 3:47:42.060]  Hormala. I just go to Hormala anyway. That's what I call her. What a feminist. Sleep your way to the top.
[3:47:42.060 --> 3:47:47.060]  Gotta love that about her. Nothing says strength as a woman than sleep your way to the top.
[3:47:47.060 --> 3:47:58.060]  So we're not hearing much from her, which I actually thought that would be the case because I think by the time they probably take Biden off the market,
[3:47:58.060 --> 3:48:05.060]  let's say, either blame a patriot for the act, of course, in a false flag or whatever they do and proper up.
[3:48:05.060 --> 3:48:14.060]  She's always been propped up by Obama's people, so it will be very interesting to see what happens next with the whole fraudulent administration.
[3:48:14.060 --> 3:48:20.060]  Let's talk about a couple things we know right now and then let's talk about a couple of things that we should be planning.
[3:48:20.060 --> 3:48:26.060]  I always find it interesting that you can go back to the Rockefeller Report, you can go back to all of these projects that they design,
[3:48:26.060 --> 3:48:33.060]  all of these things that they do out in the public eye, telling us what they're going to do, but we never do that in reverse.
[3:48:33.060 --> 3:48:40.060]  We never tell them what the masses will do. We never plan. We don't have these projects. Why not? We should.
[3:48:40.060 --> 3:48:44.060]  So a couple of things that are going on right now, let's be very aware, right?
[3:48:44.060 --> 3:48:51.060]  So it always intrigued me that no one ever worked on a single medicine for COVID. That should be very telling.
[3:48:51.060 --> 3:48:58.060]  And I know that you, as an audience, understand this and I won't go into this very deep, but my gosh, not even pharma.
[3:48:58.060 --> 3:49:04.060]  Nobody was really working on any medicine. It was vaccine from the start and Sarah Gilbert, who worked for Gates, Oxford,
[3:49:04.060 --> 3:49:12.060]  announced in January that they were already starting on the cure before they even had named COVID-19.
[3:49:12.060 --> 3:49:18.060]  So this has always been about vaccination, multiple vaccinations. We know that and they are a disaster.
[3:49:18.060 --> 3:49:27.060]  In fact, looking at slides last night of blood, it's horrific actually to see what's going on in the bodies of those that are getting this monstrosity.
[3:49:27.060 --> 3:49:35.060]  Euthanasia is going to be coming up as something that is extremely important to them. You're going to see a lot of people, a lot of their projects.
[3:49:35.060 --> 3:49:42.060]  Let's say this, a lot of the projects that they've worked on, even Bluebeam that's rarely talked about unless you're, you know, the people that talk about it,
[3:49:42.060 --> 3:49:51.060]  give murdered, talks about suicide, people driven to suicide. Euthanasia is going to be something that I was looking at at Australia.
[3:49:51.060 --> 3:49:59.060]  They were trying to pass a bill that says, hey, if somebody's afraid, if somebody's afraid, they could be euthanized voluntarily.
[3:49:59.060 --> 3:50:05.060]  You're going to see a lot of that. That's why I like Greg's message. Greg's message was all about, hey, you know what?
[3:50:05.060 --> 3:50:10.060]  Don't be afraid of what's happening right now. Learn to calculate what you're going to do next.
[3:50:10.060 --> 3:50:18.060]  The border, where are they coming from? They're obviously bought and paid for to come to the border at this time.
[3:50:18.060 --> 3:50:25.060]  And I always find it interesting that when headlines hit and they want to divert the headlines, it's always to something that they've created.
[3:50:25.060 --> 3:50:30.060]  Either when we were talking about fraudulent elections, of course we got the Afghanistan drop, right?
[3:50:30.060 --> 3:50:39.060]  And that absolute monster of a situation in Afghanistan. I spoke to somebody on the ground there and somebody that owns a store.
[3:50:39.060 --> 3:50:49.060]  And they said, you know, they said, we all know that the leaders of these groups are in Pakistan and that they're not here.
[3:50:49.060 --> 3:50:54.060]  And that most of the people in the Taliban are actually Afghani nationalists.
[3:50:54.060 --> 3:50:58.060]  But then you have the few that are run by those that live out of the country.
[3:50:58.060 --> 3:51:06.060]  And they said, you know, they said they knew that the situation was going to go south because these are older men and younger boys
[3:51:06.060 --> 3:51:10.060]  and could have never, never short up their own army, so to speak.
[3:51:10.060 --> 3:51:14.060]  So there's a lot going on there that we could talk about too.
[3:51:14.060 --> 3:51:21.060]  But NYC, New York, saying that if you walk out, if you walk out, we're going to hire foreigners.
[3:51:21.060 --> 3:51:25.060]  We're going to make sure foreigners fill your spots, not people from other countries.
[3:51:25.060 --> 3:51:33.060]  No, foreigners. And so you're going to see a lot of foreigners brought in if people dare to leave their job and they're doing this in droves.
[3:51:33.060 --> 3:51:37.060]  We have people suing the schools. We have educators suing right now.
[3:51:37.060 --> 3:51:41.060]  We've got, we've got the firemen that I had on in California.
[3:51:41.060 --> 3:51:44.060]  They are causing a lot of people to do the same.
[3:51:44.060 --> 3:51:47.060]  And then also people are walking out. They're just simply walking away.
[3:51:47.060 --> 3:51:53.060]  And I can't even imagine something more horrific than having more foreigners coming in for those jobs.
[3:51:53.060 --> 3:51:56.060]  But I was also looking at the headlines in Australia too.
[3:51:56.060 --> 3:52:06.060]  And are the UN cops now occupying the seats of their federal military presence on the ground, their federal police force, if you will?
[3:52:06.060 --> 3:52:11.060]  Well, it's a possibility, right? We kind of knew that was probably going to come.
[3:52:11.060 --> 3:52:16.060]  And so Australia scares me. Australia is the one, it's the, it's the craft show.
[3:52:16.060 --> 3:52:20.060]  Everybody's watching this saying what's going to happen next, but they're also part of Five Eyes.
[3:52:20.060 --> 3:52:26.060]  And, and so I absolutely think that we're going to get a huge dose of this coming.
[3:52:26.060 --> 3:52:31.060]  Now, what can we do? They're weakening our military on purpose. We know this.
[3:52:31.060 --> 3:52:35.060]  And the jabs are wreaking havoc on, on people's immune systems.
[3:52:35.060 --> 3:52:42.060]  Like, like the good doctors are saying, you know, two years, you're going to see a lot of cancer and a lot of immune system problems and health go sideways.
[3:52:42.060 --> 3:52:44.060]  And so what is going to happen?
[3:52:44.060 --> 3:52:50.060]  Well, Pharma's loving it because Pharma's going to get big fat paychecks for all the health crisis is going on in America.
[3:52:50.060 --> 3:52:55.060]  But even when I look at the military, please stand as units, whole units.
[3:52:55.060 --> 3:53:00.060]  We need whole units to go after religious exemptions together and shore each other up.
[3:53:00.060 --> 3:53:10.060]  Even if you believe in this monstrosity and you're that much of a moron, please, please stand with your unit and make sure those that want the choice get their choice.
[3:53:10.060 --> 3:53:16.060]  And if you're in the military, you are supposed to be standing up for, you're our frontline freedom fighters.
[3:53:16.060 --> 3:53:19.060]  We cannot have the military weakened in this way.
[3:53:19.060 --> 3:53:22.060]  So military needs to stand together right now.
[3:53:22.060 --> 3:53:27.060]  They already started in on this with anthrax shots when we were never under an anthrax threat.
[3:53:27.060 --> 3:53:36.060]  And that shot, once they started doing that shot in the 90s, that shot started bringing about a lot of depression and suicide and all kinds of things.
[3:53:36.060 --> 3:53:41.060]  And we haven't even been in a declared war and we're getting this kind of result.
[3:53:41.060 --> 3:53:51.060]  The other things to do too, start talking about chartering planes and making sure that you do not have to fly commercial, that you can maybe put some money in the gas tank kind of thing.
[3:53:51.060 --> 3:53:55.060]  You know, you can't really pay for a flight, but hey, there's probably ways around that.
[3:53:55.060 --> 3:54:02.060]  And make sure that you are developing networks of people that you know if you need to get somewhere, fly private, right?
[3:54:02.060 --> 3:54:05.060]  There's so many things that we can do.
[3:54:05.060 --> 3:54:08.060]  And also develop networks of doctors.
[3:54:08.060 --> 3:54:11.060]  Doctors need to be opening clinics like crazy.
[3:54:11.060 --> 3:54:13.060]  You're more homeopath doctors.
[3:54:13.060 --> 3:54:14.060]  People need places to go.
[3:54:14.060 --> 3:54:22.060]  I get emails all the time about people not understanding who they can contact to get ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, myfreedoctor.com.
[3:54:22.060 --> 3:54:25.060]  But please, we have to figure out networks.
[3:54:25.060 --> 3:54:32.060]  Start sharing on social media or private messaging, if you will, even in proton mail.
[3:54:32.060 --> 3:54:37.060]  Doctors that will actually help you if you go to the hospital and not do the Kevorkian method.
[3:54:37.060 --> 3:54:40.060]  At least Kevorkian smiled and asked permission, right?
[3:54:40.060 --> 3:54:41.060]  Learn skills.
[3:54:41.060 --> 3:54:42.060]  Go to YouTube.
[3:54:42.060 --> 3:54:44.060]  Know how to drill for water.
[3:54:44.060 --> 3:54:46.060]  Water shortages are ridiculous.
[3:54:46.060 --> 3:54:47.060]  You know why they're ridiculous?
[3:54:47.060 --> 3:54:53.060]  Once government started to control water, then all of a sudden now we're dealing with shortages.
[3:54:53.060 --> 3:54:55.060]  We have water underfoot everywhere.
[3:54:55.060 --> 3:54:57.060]  Go to primarywater.org.
[3:54:57.060 --> 3:54:58.060]  Check it out.
[3:54:58.060 --> 3:55:00.060]  Make sure you know how to drill for water.
[3:55:00.060 --> 3:55:02.060]  Get some land.
[3:55:02.060 --> 3:55:05.060]  Also develop networks with neighbors and friends.
[3:55:05.060 --> 3:55:07.060]  Know who your friends are.
[3:55:07.060 --> 3:55:08.060]  Know who your neighbors are.
[3:55:08.060 --> 3:55:12.060]  What do they have with you that you can trade, that you can do?
[3:55:12.060 --> 3:55:20.060]  These are all things like atmosphere water machines that pull the atmosphere and deliver gallons of water that you can still buy.
[3:55:20.060 --> 3:55:25.060]  Make sure you buy one or build one before you're not able to.
[3:55:25.060 --> 3:55:28.060]  These are all the things I'm thinking of because, you know what?
[3:55:28.060 --> 3:55:31.060]  Last time I checked, we still had a constitution in play.
[3:55:31.060 --> 3:55:33.060]  Last time I checked, we're still Americans.
[3:55:33.060 --> 3:55:36.060]  We are not slaves yet.
[3:55:36.060 --> 3:55:37.060]  And you know what?
[3:55:37.060 --> 3:55:39.060]  There's a lot of things that we can do proactively.
[3:55:39.060 --> 3:55:41.060]  Get off the mainstream media.
[3:55:41.060 --> 3:55:42.060]  Turn it off.
[3:55:42.060 --> 3:55:43.060]  Absolutely turn it off.
[3:55:43.060 --> 3:55:44.060]  They're whores anyway.
[3:55:44.060 --> 3:55:46.060]  They're selling you stuff that isn't true.
[3:55:46.060 --> 3:55:49.060]  And start learning skills, basic skills.
[3:55:49.060 --> 3:55:52.060]  Learn how to go off-off grid if you need to.
[3:55:52.060 --> 3:55:56.060]  You know, one of the Rockefeller plans, the plan that brought us COVID-19,
[3:55:56.060 --> 3:56:00.060]  talks a lot about rural communities not getting short up with Internet,
[3:56:00.060 --> 3:56:04.060]  not being able to have all the luxury cities will.
[3:56:04.060 --> 3:56:07.060]  High agenda, 2030, 2050.
[3:56:07.060 --> 3:56:11.060]  Anyway, and so it's driving people into the city so they can get services.
[3:56:11.060 --> 3:56:13.060]  Think about the loss of those services.
[3:56:13.060 --> 3:56:16.060]  What would you do without those services at hand?
[3:56:16.060 --> 3:56:19.060]  These are the kinds of things we have to be talking about.
[3:56:19.060 --> 3:56:23.060]  If we can learn how to do some of these things like, and also order products,
[3:56:23.060 --> 3:56:25.060]  I would order a lot of supplements right now.
[3:56:25.060 --> 3:56:27.060]  Things are being taken off the market.
[3:56:27.060 --> 3:56:30.060]  NAC, I've heard from some people high up the food chain,
[3:56:30.060 --> 3:56:33.060]  that NAC will be taken off the market in January.
[3:56:33.060 --> 3:56:35.060]  FDA is trying to get it out.
[3:56:35.060 --> 3:56:40.060]  And same with ivermectin, same with hydroxy.
[3:56:40.060 --> 3:56:42.060]  They're going to try to ban these things.
[3:56:42.060 --> 3:56:46.060]  These are the things that right now we can proactively do.
[3:56:46.060 --> 3:56:51.060]  Put your money in some supplements so you have them to share with people that can't afford them.
[3:56:51.060 --> 3:56:54.060]  Get a nebulizer, like Dr. Lee Merritt said.
[3:56:54.060 --> 3:56:57.060]  Make sure that you are handling your health at home.
[3:56:57.060 --> 3:57:00.060]  Make sure that not every book you have is on a Kindle.
[3:57:00.060 --> 3:57:03.060]  Remember, Kindle means firewood. It's kindling.
[3:57:03.060 --> 3:57:05.060]  It's a book burning.
[3:57:05.060 --> 3:57:10.060]  Remember that you have to have books at home on how to do things,
[3:57:10.060 --> 3:57:13.060]  on how to educate yourself, whatever the case may be.
[3:57:13.060 --> 3:57:17.060]  Make sure you have all of these things solidly in your home.
[3:57:17.060 --> 3:57:20.060]  Prepping needs to be on, I think, high gear right now,
[3:57:20.060 --> 3:57:22.060]  especially with inflation and everything else.
[3:57:22.060 --> 3:57:25.060]  A lot of the things we're going to be talking about on my show today, too.
