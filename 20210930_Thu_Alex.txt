[00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:15.444]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Alex Jones Show live on this Thursday, September 30th, 2021.
[00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:21.449]  I'm Owen Troyer sitting in for Alex today in the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.774]  We will be hearing from Alex coming up in the next segment and then later at the bottom of the hour as well.
[00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:52.258]  The big story today has to be the next level of government overreach when it comes to COVID and I actually had this reported to me last night after an individual who called into the war room called in the war room talked about how the hospital
[00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:57.184]  Wouldn't let her in to visit her boyfriend because she wasn't vaccinated.
[00:00:57.184 --> 00:01:02.705]  And then when she finally got in via a back door, they then kicked her out aggressively.
[00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:11.387]  She said after she hung up the phone of telling that story on air, she got a call from the CDC saying, why aren't you vaccinated?
[00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:13.968]  So I was already going to cover that today.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:33.941]  When I'm talking to Alex this morning and he's sending me more information about this and now we have stories up at InfoWars.com where people are getting automated calls and messages from the CDC and then sometimes there's actually a person on the other side of the line.
[00:01:35.322 --> 00:01:38.204]  And they're asking, how did you get my number?
[00:01:38.204 --> 00:01:39.706]  Am I in a database?
[00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:41.527]  And they say, oh, yes.
[00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:47.312]  Well, we know that you're not vaccinated, and so we do have your number, and we're reaching out to the unvaccinated.
[00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:53.456]  So you're already on a database for the COVID vaccine.
[00:01:53.456 --> 00:02:00.202]  No warning, no law sign, no bill sign, nothing like that.
[00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:04.205]  Just, oh, you haven't been vaccinated, and so you're on a list.
[00:02:06.587 --> 00:02:22.137]  It's just yet another level of the political persecution where you have conservatives like Nick Fuentes and others who are on no-fly lists or on terror watch lists.
[00:02:22.137 --> 00:02:26.761]  That's right.
[00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:28.722]  And now you may get a call
[00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:37.046]  You in this audience, the unvaccinated, which is not even the right word for it, you're just not vaccinated, or you don't have a COVID vaccine.
[00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:44.133]  I mean, unvaccinated would insinuate you've already had it, but that's just semantics.
[00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:48.377]  You, the person that doesn't want to comply with medical tyranny.
[00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.379]  You, the person that doesn't want to live your life in fear.
[00:02:51.587 --> 00:03:00.233]  You, the non-COVID vaxxed individual, you're now on a government watch list and you might be getting a call from the CDC.
[00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:01.974]  How loving is that?
[00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:04.115]  They just love spying on you.
[00:03:04.115 --> 00:03:06.357]  And now they want a new way of spying on you, by the way.
[00:03:06.357 --> 00:03:13.422]  There's a story out today about geotrackable and traceable firearms.
[00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:14.943]  Oh, I see.
[00:03:14.943 --> 00:03:15.323]  I see.
[00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:20.266]  That way you can have it be like your car or like your phone and it's just always on the grid now.
[00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.167]  The Internet of Things.
[00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:32.452]  And by the way, if you say something that's true about COVID or about the vaccines, YouTube's gonna ban you.
[00:03:32.452 --> 00:03:45.577]  They made that policy and thousands, perhaps millions, I mean, I know of multiple conservative commentators and hosts that had a YouTube channel that already got a strike, two strikes, just overnight.
[00:03:45.577 --> 00:03:49.919]  Not even on a new video they did, just, oh, you said this about COVID, we're hitting you with a strike.
[00:03:52.014 --> 00:03:53.055]  So they're really going for it.
[00:03:53.055 --> 00:04:03.661]  And then the CEO, Susan Wojcicki, she comes out and she says, we are pro-free speech at YouTube.
[00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:06.803]  Oh, you're just censoring everybody you don't like, but you're pro-free speech.
[00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:08.144]  Right, right, right.
[00:04:08.144 --> 00:04:09.244]  Okay.
[00:04:09.244 --> 00:04:12.846]  So we'll have more of the COVID tyranny.
[00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:20.411]  And then, I'll tell you, there's things happening in the White House right now that aren't getting much coverage.
[00:04:21.843 --> 00:04:32.674]  Either they're getting ready for Kamala Harris to take over or she realizes that she's the most unpopular vice president ever and so she's doing some things behind the scenes that would tell you that.
[00:04:32.674 --> 00:04:36.458]  And then Biden, hey you know that there was a congressional baseball game happened last night.
[00:04:38.632 --> 00:04:43.317]  Let's not forget when the Democrat tried to commit mass murder, James Hodgkinson.
[00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:48.243]  Remember when he tried to commit mass murder and have a mass shooting at the Republican baseball practice and the media ignored it?
[00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:49.685]  Well, because he's a Democrat.
[00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:51.647]  Well, they had a congressional baseball game last night.
[00:04:51.647 --> 00:04:53.088]  Biden showed up.
[00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:55.611]  And how do you think he was received?
[00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:56.712]  We'll have more on that.
[00:04:56.712 --> 00:04:57.694]  Alex Jones on the other side.
[00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:05.456]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:12.766]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:15.570]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:25.684]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[00:05:25.684 --> 00:05:32.854]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[00:05:33.574 --> 00:05:43.981]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:46.743]  You will then be my slaves.
[00:05:46.743 --> 00:05:51.426]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:57.470]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[00:06:13.627 --> 00:06:17.769]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:50.120]  It is Thursday, September 30th, 2021, and I come to you with very grave news.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:07:01.947]  We have documented the public admissions of the UN and every other major Western government under it to establish what they call the shielding process.
[00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:04.309]  And that is where even the CDC's own documents
[00:07:05.347 --> 00:07:33.674]  They will take the mass of the population, the majority of the population that they claim do not have COVID, and put them in giant government facilities, sports stadiums, military bases, but also lock down each neighborhood, putting leftist contact tracers through the Clinton Global Initiative and Google, that's who runs it, as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they've all gotten big contracts from the government here in the U.S., to oversee the neighborhood and basically set up their own Maoist-style communist takeover.
[00:07:34.534 --> 00:07:43.450]  COVID-19 is the cover for a worldwide corporate fascist takeover using communism as the operating system on the ground.
[00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.611]  Now...
[00:07:44.688 --> 00:07:47.809]  Over a year ago, the CDC put out its report on shielding.
[00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:49.490]  We'll put that on screen.
[00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.851]  It's the exact same program of the UN, exact same program of Australia, same program of the UK and Canada.
[00:07:54.851 --> 00:08:06.455]  They've now built emergency cities that hold between 5 and 30,000 people as propaganda pieces to show how wonderful it is and how nice it is and how they're separate areas for the men, women, and children.
[00:08:07.631 --> 00:08:07.851]  I don't
[00:08:23.499 --> 00:08:30.780]  And persecute those who've not taken the injection, which they're now openly doing, saying this is a epidemic, a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:49.224]  Well, I said 20 months ago, when the inoculations make people sick, they will then turn around and say the unvaccinated are making everybody sick, when the evidence is it's really the shedding, as top scientists told us, from these injections that are not classic vaccines, but are systems that reprogram your body to create the spike protein.
[00:08:49.224 --> 00:08:49.624]  So now,
[00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:57.335]  In just the last 10 hours, or 15 hours or so since I was working late last night, it's all broken.
[00:08:57.335 --> 00:08:57.915]  Okay?
[00:08:57.915 --> 00:09:00.096]  In Australia, in the U.S., everywhere.
[00:09:00.096 --> 00:09:14.005]  They are now putting out CDC letters to hire thousands of managers per state as contact tracers to then go and oversee people at the, quote, shielded facilities.
[00:09:14.818 --> 00:09:18.639]  So they are using the term the shield process.
[00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:25.781]  And again, this is where they quote, take the healthy people and say, you're locked up because the unvaccinated are dangerous, making you sick.
[00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:33.083]  They will then buy into the Stockholm syndrome and be reprogrammed with these facilities to literally be a political army that then marches against
[00:09:34.434 --> 00:09:36.336]  The uninjected.
[00:09:36.336 --> 00:09:38.357]  The magnitude of this evil is incredible.
[00:09:38.357 --> 00:09:54.631]  And again, by this winter, the top scientists have reported that the autoimmune response of people that are already producing the spike protein, when they run into normal coronaviruses, it's going to cause a huge cytokine storm and a huge autoimmune response and super bad illnesses and death.
[00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:56.533]  They're going to say that's caused by the unvaccinated.
[00:09:57.193 --> 00:10:03.968]  So I kept asking the last two years or 20 months, how are they going to get everybody sick with these shots and the cover that it's not?
[00:10:04.966 --> 00:10:09.650]  The shots that did it, and we said they'll say it's the unvaccinated.
[00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.291]  So this is how you take over society.
[00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:12.932]  It's how you shut down all the small businesses.
[00:10:12.932 --> 00:10:18.696]  It's how Walmart and Amazon, everybody are able to take over because everybody else is going to be being shut down.
[00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:26.162]  They're going to force everybody to take weekly and then daily PCR tests at all the trucking companies, all the major distributor warehouses.
[00:10:26.162 --> 00:10:27.563]  This is all in the plans.
[00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:29.525]  Those that won't will be fired.
[00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:31.606]  That will then break down society further.
[00:10:31.606 --> 00:10:32.327]  So this is it.
[00:10:32.327 --> 00:10:33.368]  This is the big takeover.
[00:10:34.543 --> 00:10:37.905]  Everything you see in Australia, as I've warned you, is now coming here.
[00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:40.146]  Biden said his patience is wearing thin.
[00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:41.286]  That's all a script.
[00:10:41.286 --> 00:10:42.707]  And notice he's saying, build back better.
[00:10:42.707 --> 00:10:46.749]  That is the public PR term of the Great Reset and Cause Swap.
[00:10:46.749 --> 00:10:50.451]  Build back better means collapse industrial society, get rid of the middle class.
[00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:57.034]  That's why the UN, when we were there a few months ago, has huge signs up saying, you'll no longer live in cities, you'll live in communes.
[00:10:57.034 --> 00:11:00.735]  And it shows concrete little concentration camp bunkers like something out of 1984.
[00:11:02.369 --> 00:11:04.431]  That's because that's their plan.
[00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:09.214]  So again, it's cloud and pivot on steroids, bankrupt the economy, bring everything down.
[00:11:09.214 --> 00:11:10.935]  So, I was already covering this last night.
[00:11:10.935 --> 00:11:16.259]  I was already preparing articles with Paul Joseph Watson today for InfoWars.com that are now up.
[00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:24.526]  Then this morning, on Facebook, posters start saying, I'm getting called by the CDC National Vaccine Survey.
[00:11:26.058 --> 00:11:27.659]  They showed screenshots.
[00:11:27.659 --> 00:11:28.400]  We called the number.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.120]  We checked it out.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.322]  It's a real place in Chicago.
[00:11:31.322 --> 00:11:40.568]  They've got them all over the country that are now calling the quote unvaccinated and basically bullying them and threatening them and saying, well, you need to get your shot.
[00:11:40.568 --> 00:11:45.991]  Total violation of the Nuremberg Code, total violation of HIPAA, total violation of your privacy.
[00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:49.414]  But this is a revolution against your privacy, revolution against your rights.
[00:11:49.414 --> 00:11:54.277]  Major ethics professor came out yesterday of a major university and said this is all evil.
[00:11:54.277 --> 00:11:55.137]  YouTube took him down.
[00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:55.177]  So
[00:11:56.858 --> 00:11:58.579]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're going to make their move here.
[00:11:58.579 --> 00:11:59.679]  They're making their move here.
[00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:09.162]  And that's why they want to get the majority of people injected so that they can then organize them as the good people against those of us that don't take the shots as the bad people.
[00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:11.102]  They've tried to use race to divide us.
[00:12:11.102 --> 00:12:13.383]  They've tried to use economics to divide us.
[00:12:13.383 --> 00:12:17.184]  Now they're going to use the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated again, telling the vaccinated
[00:12:18.001 --> 00:12:23.386]  You're sick because of the unvaccinated, and you can't go back to normal because of them.
[00:12:23.386 --> 00:12:25.047]  We're trying to get you back to normal.
[00:12:25.047 --> 00:12:26.509]  Now, we're about a year behind Australia.
[00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:28.070]  Australia was saying that a year ago.
[00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.973]  Now Australia says, sorry, you all took the shot.
[00:12:30.973 --> 00:12:31.894]  It never goes away.
[00:12:31.894 --> 00:12:33.795]  You get shots every few months.
[00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:42.123]  So again, the poor fools that have Stockholm Syndrome, this is so scary they can't handle it, don't know how to deal with the fact they're being abused and attacked.
[00:12:42.123 --> 00:12:43.084]  They have learned helplessness.
[00:12:44.008 --> 00:12:44.208]  I don't
[00:13:06.755 --> 00:13:08.496]  Call this number so you can hear this for yourself.
[00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.537]  We got all the screenshots.
[00:13:09.537 --> 00:13:14.160]  It's in Paul Joseph Watson's report, again on Infowars.com.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.741]  But this is the rollout.
[00:13:15.741 --> 00:13:16.742]  This is the preparation.
[00:13:16.742 --> 00:13:21.285]  And then they're going to go out with contact tracers and say, oh, we can't let you spread COVID-19.
[00:13:21.285 --> 00:13:22.886]  They're going to release more deadly variants.
[00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:23.866]  You know that's coming.
[00:13:23.866 --> 00:13:26.368]  And then now we've got to arrest those that won't take the shots.
[00:13:26.368 --> 00:13:33.893]  And we've got to put people in camps to, quote, protect them, quote, take your children to make sure they're safe because they care about the children so much.
[00:13:33.893 --> 00:13:35.254]  This is a real nightmare.
[00:13:35.254 --> 00:13:36.015]  This is happening now.
[00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:36.655]  Go ahead and call them.
[00:13:36.735 --> 00:13:38.937]  This is Chicago, Illinois.
[00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:45.422]  Turn it up all the way.
[00:13:45.422 --> 00:13:48.885]  They'll answer in a moment.
[00:13:48.885 --> 00:13:56.271]  You have reached the National Immunization Survey conducted by NOIC at the University of Chicago on behalf of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
[00:13:56.271 --> 00:13:58.933]  We are unable to answer your call at this time.
[00:13:58.933 --> 00:14:04.338]  Please leave your full name, phone number, and a brief message and we will return your call as soon as possible.
[00:14:04.338 --> 00:14:04.658]  Thank you.
[00:14:05.808 --> 00:14:07.434]  Hold your message at the tone.
[00:14:07.434 --> 00:14:10.905]  When you are finished, hang up or press pound for more options.
[00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:13.121]  Here's my message.
[00:14:13.121 --> 00:14:21.464]  This is Alex Jones, broadcasting worldwide, and we are aware of the fact that you're just contractors that are engaged in this activity.
[00:14:21.464 --> 00:14:26.906]  It doesn't matter if you say it's a CDC contract or if you just say that it's a national survey.
[00:14:26.906 --> 00:14:32.608]  There are reports coming in that you're calling people at their homes and saying, we have evidence you're not vaccinated, when they ask, how do you know?
[00:14:32.608 --> 00:14:34.429]  Oh, we have a national database.
[00:14:34.429 --> 00:14:36.749]  That national database is illegal.
[00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:37.590]  It violates HIPAA.
[00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:38.750]  I think?
[00:14:58.303 --> 00:15:13.506]  That in my extremely educated opinion, what you're all doing is illegal and you're being put on notice right now that what you're doing is to condition the public and bully the public using these databases and that you need to cease and desist.
[00:15:13.506 --> 00:15:16.887]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[00:15:16.887 --> 00:15:20.988]  Okay, so there is the voicemail that I just left for them.
[00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:26.021]  Again, I'm going to be back on air later today, breaking all this down.
[00:15:26.021 --> 00:15:27.942]  I'm going to be on Steven Crowder's show.
[00:15:27.942 --> 00:15:34.507]  But the thing you need to understand is this is extremely serious, and that the globalists are taking over the country and taking over the world.
[00:15:34.507 --> 00:15:38.650]  This is a worldwide UN-directed program, and this is it.
[00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:43.033]  We must get the governors, the legislatures, and others to wake up and understand that this is a takeover plan.
[00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:45.095]  The more we give in, the worse the crisis gets.
[00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:46.856]  The contact tracers are coming.
[00:15:46.856 --> 00:15:48.417]  The new lockdowns are coming.
[00:15:48.417 --> 00:15:50.839]  The persecution of the uninjected is coming.
[00:15:50.839 --> 00:15:52.080]  Back to Owen Schroeder on our broadcast.
[00:15:57.489 --> 00:16:05.911]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[00:16:05.911 --> 00:16:06.931]  Here's why.
[00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:10.852]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[00:16:10.852 --> 00:16:15.973]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[00:16:15.973 --> 00:16:24.375]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[00:16:24.955 --> 00:16:32.951]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:16:33.644 --> 00:16:39.749]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:43.571]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:45.593]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:16:45.593 --> 00:16:53.999]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:56.361]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[00:16:56.929 --> 00:16:57.870]  Hey everybody.
[00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:03.375]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:05.838]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[00:17:05.838 --> 00:17:06.679]  Here's the thing.
[00:17:06.679 --> 00:17:10.983]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[00:17:10.983 --> 00:17:11.924]  Survival soup beans.
[00:17:12.324 --> 00:17:20.513]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[00:17:20.513 --> 00:17:21.615]  The best part?
[00:17:21.615 --> 00:17:30.645]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[00:17:30.885 --> 00:17:31.925]  Gets even better!
[00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:42.690]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.511]  Period.
[00:17:43.511 --> 00:17:45.531]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:47.692]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:51.774]  And discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away.
[00:17:51.774 --> 00:17:53.655]  At soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:54.916]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:58.444 --> 00:18:00.084]  I got some good news.
[00:18:00.084 --> 00:18:06.306]  All the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50% off at InfoWarshaw.com.
[00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:09.627]  The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out.
[00:18:09.627 --> 00:18:13.268]  So this sale is only going from one week starting on September 29th.
[00:18:13.268 --> 00:18:15.289]  And in the case of green fiber capsules,
[00:18:16.209 --> 00:18:18.571]  These will be sold out in just a couple days.
[00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:19.732]  50% off.
[00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:21.393]  We have Knockout Sleep Aid.
[00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:21.994]  50% off.
[00:18:21.994 --> 00:18:23.195]  Sold out for months.
[00:18:23.195 --> 00:18:24.156]  Very popular.
[00:18:24.156 --> 00:18:25.757]  Twice as strong as Knockout.
[00:18:25.757 --> 00:18:27.198]  Probably too strong for some people.
[00:18:27.198 --> 00:18:28.659]  Totally different formula.
[00:18:28.659 --> 00:18:29.900]  Down and Out is back in stock.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.941]  50% off.
[00:18:30.941 --> 00:18:34.124]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12.
[00:18:34.124 --> 00:18:34.924]  50% off.
[00:18:34.924 --> 00:18:37.887]  And also on Deep Earth Crystal Iodine Survival Cell X2.
[00:18:38.427 --> 00:18:39.468]  It's a win-win.
[00:18:39.468 --> 00:18:43.730]  These are things that make you healthy, make your life better, and they fund the Infowar.
[00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.412]  Again, the only way we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[00:18:58.399 --> 00:19:02.803]  By now you've heard me talk about the BioPros and how they're creating amazing products.
[00:19:02.803 --> 00:19:11.731]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio-remediation products, bringing industrial-level technology to the everyday consumer.
[00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:15.934]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[00:19:15.934 --> 00:19:24.142]  The BioPros are excited to release BioDrain Pro, a product specifically designed to establish healthy drains, pipes, and overall plumbing systems.
[00:19:24.722 --> 00:19:31.290]  BioDrain Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper, and organic matter with ease.
[00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:38.378]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs, and is safe for black, gray holding tanks, sewer hoses, and plumbing.
[00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:40.500]  It is also human and animal safe.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.245]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[00:19:44.885 --> 00:19:47.308]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:12.207 --> 00:20:31.154]  All right ladies and gentlemen, my head is spinning with all the news that's developing right now, but it's all
[00:20:32.287 --> 00:20:53.088]  Par for the course, as we are being goose-stepped and brainwashed into global government medical tyranny under the guise of fighting a virus known as COVID-19, which is now pretty much publicly accepted as being created in the Wuhan lab by Anthony Fauci and Peter Daszak with the Chinese military.
[00:20:53.769 --> 00:21:11.119]  But we just don't like to talk about that or admit that that's the real deal because then that would cause us to have to take action against Fauci and Dasik and we don't want to do that because they've been lifted up as heroes by the mainstream media and we don't want to do that because then the mainstream media would be completely discredited and all the lies that they've been telling us for years would completely fall apart.
[00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:17.302]  So we can't start that train or series of events if you will.
[00:21:17.302 --> 00:21:22.285]  So we are going to call I think I'm going to do it in the next segment.
[00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:40.965]  We'll call the CDC hotline because they now are, without announcing it, announcing it just by telling you that it's happening, they never said it was going to happen, there was never a debate, there was never a law signed, no.
[00:21:40.965 --> 00:21:49.853]  The CDC just now has the vaccine database built so it knows that you haven't been vaccinated
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:22:01.806]  And you may be getting a call and you may be getting a text from your loving tyrants at the CDC just asking you why you haven't been vaccinated.
[00:22:01.806 --> 00:22:04.368]  What's wrong with you?
[00:22:04.368 --> 00:22:05.449]  Do you want to be fined?
[00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:06.309]  Do you want to be arrested?
[00:22:06.309 --> 00:22:07.770]  Do you want to be put in a quarantine camp?
[00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:12.853]  Because you better get that vaccine if not.
[00:22:12.853 --> 00:22:14.054]  Oh, that's not scary at all.
[00:22:16.583 --> 00:22:20.725]  And I have to say, though, and I'll just get started into the stack of news.
[00:22:20.725 --> 00:22:23.947]  I thought that this was a joke when I first saw it.
[00:22:23.947 --> 00:22:26.008]  I guess maybe it was last night.
[00:22:26.008 --> 00:22:28.549]  Pfizer-Mectin.
[00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:30.230]  Pfizer-Mectin.
[00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.872]  Again, I thought it was a joke.
[00:22:34.872 --> 00:22:44.837]  And they were just making fun of the fact that Ivermectin works and Pfizer's pissed that it works because it's more effective than the vaccine at stopping the spread of COVID or healing you from COVID.
[00:22:45.882 --> 00:22:47.503]  Well, no, it was actually real.
[00:22:47.503 --> 00:23:04.293]  It's not called Pfizer-Mectin, but Pfizer enters late-stage study for oral COVID-19 antiviral drug, and ladies and gentlemen, it's the pretty much the same thing as Ivermectin.
[00:23:04.293 --> 00:23:07.615]  It's just Pfizer's brand.
[00:23:07.615 --> 00:23:13.019]  And so Pfizer's new drug is from the Zero Hedge article, a quote on it,
[00:23:14.943 --> 00:23:23.867]  Pfizer's new drug, which some have jokingly dubbed Pfizer-Mectin, is described by the pharmaceutical giant as a potent protease inhibitor.
[00:23:23.867 --> 00:23:30.850]  That's exactly what Ivermectin, the probiotic used for a number of reasons in both humans and animals, does.
[00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:43.516]  So, the scoundrels, the crooks over at Pfizer, I mean, look, I'm not the type of person that would like to put blood money into my bank account, but
[00:23:45.052 --> 00:23:51.056]  And I'm not giving financial advice here, but boy oh boy, a Pfizer stock probably looks pretty good right now.
[00:23:51.056 --> 00:23:53.357]  They just get to own the entire market.
[00:23:53.357 --> 00:24:09.086]  So Pfizer and the vaccine manufacturers, big pharma, don't want you to know about ivermectin because then they can't get billion-dollar contracts and sell billions of vaccines if ivermectin is effective treatment, which it is.
[00:24:09.086 --> 00:24:13.629]  So the media that they own on the internet and on television
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.964]  Comes out against Ivermectin because it hurts their bottom line at Pfizer.
[00:24:19.964 --> 00:24:39.702]  Well, what do you do when you can't completely scuttle that news from getting out that Ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID and in India, where it's been implemented in massive cities, it's pretty much been 100% effective.
[00:24:39.702 --> 00:24:40.963]  Eliminating COVID is an issue.
[00:24:42.284 --> 00:24:45.426]  So what do you do if you're Pfizer and this is hurting your bottom line?
[00:24:45.426 --> 00:24:51.669]  Well, you just make the exact same product as Vivermectin and rebrand it as your own and say, okay, this is good for COVID.
[00:24:51.669 --> 00:25:00.073]  Same thing, different brand, one's okay for COVID, the other's horse de warmer.
[00:25:00.073 --> 00:25:02.454]  This is truly astounding.
[00:25:02.454 --> 00:25:05.255]  And this is just the evil of Big Pharma.
[00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:08.357]  This is just the evil of the media that's owned by Big Pharma.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.941]  And yet another example.
[00:25:11.941 --> 00:25:16.085]  First it was COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines bad for pregnant women.
[00:25:16.085 --> 00:25:18.427]  Now they're just urging you to get it.
[00:25:18.427 --> 00:25:19.828]  Urgent alert.
[00:25:19.828 --> 00:25:24.452]  Pregnant women need the vaccine.
[00:25:24.452 --> 00:25:28.836]  And even though they admit that the vaccine gives you more of a viral load.
[00:25:28.836 --> 00:25:33.880]  And so they say, oh, COVID itself has such a bad effect on pregnant women.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.523]  Therefore, you need to get the vaccine that gives you more COVID.
[00:25:39.188 --> 00:25:45.631]  All propaganda, all so that you buy big pharmaceuticals product and make them filthy rich.
[00:25:45.631 --> 00:25:51.853]  And of course, the establishment of global government just comes side by side with this.
[00:25:51.853 --> 00:25:57.995]  They can make you fear your life over a virus and give over all of your freedoms in the name of fear, of that fear.
[00:25:57.995 --> 00:26:03.658]  Well then they've got you in a prison already.
[00:26:03.658 --> 00:26:06.859]  And that of course is the goal here.
[00:26:08.957 --> 00:26:18.806]  And you're starting to see people reporting that they're getting calls and automated messages from the CDC saying, you're not vaccinated, what's wrong with you?
[00:26:18.806 --> 00:26:23.590]  Come to one of these facilities, get your vaccine, you dirty rotten American.
[00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.973]  We will force vaccinate you if not.
[00:26:26.973 --> 00:26:31.196]  I have people sending me emails, messages, showing me these messages.
[00:26:31.196 --> 00:26:36.161]  They're sending me emails that they're getting from their private companies basically saying, get the vaccine or you're fired.
[00:26:37.418 --> 00:26:39.660]  And that's all thanks to the Biden administration.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.022]  And they say it in these emails, too.
[00:26:42.022 --> 00:26:43.703]  That it's the Biden administration doing this.
[00:26:43.703 --> 00:26:48.227]  So they blame the Biden administration, but it's a policy that they're enacting.
[00:26:48.227 --> 00:26:50.629]  Hey, you don't have to follow tyrannical orders.
[00:26:50.629 --> 00:26:53.371]  You don't have to follow illegal orders.
[00:26:53.371 --> 00:26:58.616]  You can fight back against this illegal vaccine mandate on so many different fronts.
[00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:02.058]  So you giving into it, but then passing the blame on Biden.
[00:27:02.058 --> 00:27:03.359]  But that's the perfect excuse.
[00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:04.781]  That's the perfect getaway.
[00:27:04.781 --> 00:27:05.661]  Is, oh, I'm...
[00:27:06.642 --> 00:27:09.504]  I'm force-medicating you, but it's not my fault.
[00:27:09.504 --> 00:27:11.066]  It's Biden's fault.
[00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:12.687]  Yeah, you're the one telling me to do it.
[00:27:12.687 --> 00:27:14.108]  You're the one telling me I'm going to get fired.
[00:27:14.108 --> 00:27:15.329]  You're the one forcing the needle into me.
[00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:16.550]  You're the one holding me down.
[00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.411]  No, this isn't me.
[00:27:18.411 --> 00:27:19.752]  No, it's Biden.
[00:27:19.752 --> 00:27:24.076]  So it's the perfect scapegoat, Biden is, for all of this nonsense.
[00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:27.638]  Afghanistan, mandatory vaccines.
[00:27:27.638 --> 00:27:28.779]  Biden, the perfect scapegoat.
[00:27:28.779 --> 00:27:31.742]  The guy who can't even control his own bowel movements.
[00:27:34.284 --> 00:27:45.111]  And they just say, yep, you're gonna be fired, and you're gonna lose your job, and it's all because of the Biden administration, but sorry, get the vaccine, it's not our fault, we love you.
[00:27:45.111 --> 00:27:49.173]  So, the report at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:49.173 --> 00:27:54.157]  Americans being shamed into getting vaccinated by CDC callers.
[00:27:54.157 --> 00:27:57.259]  Just totally obnoxious.
[00:27:57.259 --> 00:28:02.342]  CDC issues urgent advisory calling on pregnant people to take COVID jabs despite
[00:28:03.961 --> 00:28:08.724]  Citing spike in deaths and pregnancy complications from COVID and the COVID jab.
[00:28:08.724 --> 00:28:18.871]  So, this is going to hurt you, this is going to give you massive side effects, your baby might not live after this, you may never be able to have another baby, but you better get this vaccine because, well, COVID.
[00:28:18.871 --> 00:28:20.292]  See?
[00:28:20.292 --> 00:28:24.895]  So throw all logic, throw all reasoning, throw all common sense out the door.
[00:28:24.895 --> 00:28:25.976]  I said COVID.
[00:28:25.976 --> 00:28:27.456]  Did you hear me?
[00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:28.337]  Did you not hear me?
[00:28:28.337 --> 00:28:29.178]  I said COVID.
[00:28:30.037 --> 00:28:35.499]  So, forget about... See, 3.5 trillion equals zero dollars.
[00:28:35.499 --> 00:28:38.460]  There's 2,000 genders.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.181]  Everyone I disagree with is a racist.
[00:28:41.181 --> 00:28:45.102]  And if I say the word COVID, it's like abracadabra.
[00:28:45.102 --> 00:28:45.702]  COVID.
[00:28:45.702 --> 00:28:45.982]  Oh!
[00:28:45.982 --> 00:28:46.283]  Oh!
[00:28:46.283 --> 00:28:46.903]  Oh!
[00:28:46.903 --> 00:28:47.703]  COVID.
[00:28:47.703 --> 00:28:47.823]  Oh!
[00:28:47.823 --> 00:28:49.664]  It's like, forget all reasoning.
[00:28:49.664 --> 00:28:50.704]  Forget all common sense.
[00:28:50.704 --> 00:28:51.464]  Don't think.
[00:28:51.464 --> 00:28:52.245]  Don't talk.
[00:28:52.245 --> 00:28:53.245]  Just COVID.
[00:28:53.245 --> 00:28:53.865]  Oh, COVID!
[00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:54.685]  He said COVID.
[00:28:54.685 --> 00:28:55.346]  What do I do?
[00:28:55.346 --> 00:28:55.686]  What do I do?
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.340]  Hey, everybody.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.581]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[00:29:01.581 --> 00:29:02.341]  Me too.
[00:29:02.341 --> 00:29:09.443]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[00:29:09.443 --> 00:29:13.825]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[00:29:13.825 --> 00:29:15.725]  You probably already believe that.
[00:29:15.725 --> 00:29:16.745]  I certainly do.
[00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:17.686]  So here's the thing.
[00:29:17.686 --> 00:29:26.008]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[00:29:26.568 --> 00:29:32.012]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[00:29:32.012 --> 00:29:33.353]  No cures or treatments there.

[00:30:16.372 --> 00:30:19.833]  You go off for a while, come back on it, it works again.
[00:30:19.833 --> 00:30:20.493]  So what did I do?
[00:30:20.493 --> 00:30:31.758]  I went to the developers and I said, make a totally different formula with a lot of other known natural healthy compounds that make you sleep deep and restful, because that's what helps your immune system, and I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout.
[00:30:32.438 --> 00:30:34.259]  Okay, be careful when you take it.
[00:30:34.259 --> 00:30:35.599]  It's incredibly strong.
[00:30:35.599 --> 00:30:36.659]  It's named Down-N-Out.
[00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:40.460]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it, but it is extremely strong.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.041]  We are extremely proud of it.

[00:30:54.404 --> 00:30:56.705]  I thank you for your support because it keeps us on the air.
[00:30:58.595 --> 00:31:03.997]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered?
[00:31:03.997 --> 00:31:06.058]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store?
[00:31:06.058 --> 00:31:07.779]  Do you think they would let you in?
[00:31:07.779 --> 00:31:12.421]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting?
[00:31:12.421 --> 00:31:20.725]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on?
[00:31:20.725 --> 00:31:22.326]  How far do you think that would get you?
[00:31:22.326 --> 00:31:26.908]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space
[00:31:27.708 --> 00:31:28.609]  Alien?
[00:31:28.609 --> 00:31:35.733]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[00:31:35.733 --> 00:31:39.396]  The globalists are running a psychological war for operational humanity.
[00:31:39.396 --> 00:31:42.178]  Only waking up to the Great Reset and its tyranny will save us.
[00:31:42.938 --> 00:31:45.240]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:51.226]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud, and that it's dangerous, and that it causes major medical issues, and it's dehumanizing.
[00:31:51.226 --> 00:31:52.808]  And the film COVIDland does that.

[00:31:58.453 --> 00:32:02.794]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[00:32:02.794 --> 00:32:13.357]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[00:32:13.357 --> 00:32:19.539]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.

[00:32:38.183 --> 00:32:45.985]  It uses a unique quick-release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.

[00:33:00.856 --> 00:33:03.461]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:55.837]  We're unable to answer your call at this time.
[00:33:55.837 --> 00:34:01.083]  Please leave your full name, phone number and a brief message and we will return your call as soon as possible.
[00:34:01.083 --> 00:34:02.645]  Thank you and have a good day.
[00:34:02.645 --> 00:34:04.387]  Record your message at the tone.
[00:34:04.387 --> 00:34:07.871]  When you are finished, hang up or press pound for more options.
[00:34:09.346 --> 00:34:11.867]  Yes, hello, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:34:11.867 --> 00:34:29.455]  I'm a journalist and a syndicated talk show host from freeworldnews.tv and we have disturbing reports that the CDC has a database of unvaccinated Americans that they are currently using to harass them and pressure them into getting the vaccine.
[00:34:29.455 --> 00:34:32.976]  I remember going to school and being told not to fall into peer pressure to take drugs.
[00:34:32.976 --> 00:34:35.257]  It seems that you guys are taking the opposite approach.
[00:34:35.257 --> 00:34:38.659]  I was curious if the CDC would like to release a statement on this
[00:34:39.239 --> 00:35:02.105]  How it got the database with the unvaccinated Americans to call and harass if that's legal if there was ever a debate and you don't have to respond to me personally but I would suggest that you make a public statement for the world to see or for America to see because a lot of people are concerned with this medical tyranny and now they're winding up on a list
[00:35:02.625 --> 00:35:08.371]  Causing the CDC and the government to call them and force them into taking an experimental drug.
[00:35:08.371 --> 00:35:10.373]  It would be nice for you guys to be transparent about this.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:12.675]  We've had a lot of mixed messages from you.
[00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:23.667]  My guess is this won't happen, but please prove me wrong and make a public statement about CDC databases being used to harass unvaccinated Americans.
[00:35:23.667 --> 00:35:25.328]  We will wait for your answer.
[00:35:25.328 --> 00:35:25.709]  Thank you.
[00:35:27.938 --> 00:35:32.261]  Okay, so that was us trying to call the CDC here live on air.
[00:35:32.261 --> 00:35:35.263]  As you can see, it went to voicemail.
[00:35:35.263 --> 00:35:37.905]  So I just went ahead and left them a little voicemail.
[00:35:37.905 --> 00:35:42.029]  Maybe they're not taking calls from Texas at this time.
[00:35:42.029 --> 00:35:44.050]  In fact, I mean, we could give it another go.
[00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.692]  My guess is it's probably just going to be the exact same result.
[00:35:46.692 --> 00:35:49.294]  But do we want to give it another go, guys?
[00:35:49.294 --> 00:35:52.076]  Just to be sure, as they say, third time's a charm.
[00:35:52.076 --> 00:35:55.499]  We tried it once in the break, and then we just tried it there live on air.
[00:35:55.499 --> 00:35:57.120]  So we'll give it a third time's a charm.
[00:35:58.251 --> 00:35:59.657]  We'll see if the CDC can pick up a phone.
[00:36:18.893 --> 00:36:20.313]  Seems like an ignore, right?
[00:36:20.313 --> 00:36:23.495]  Alright, go ahead and cut that.
[00:36:23.495 --> 00:36:25.676]  That seems like an ignore.
[00:36:25.676 --> 00:36:30.959]  Just one ring and then right to voicemail, huh?
[00:36:30.959 --> 00:36:35.482]  Here, here, maybe we should do this.
[00:36:35.482 --> 00:36:39.224]  Maybe, if I speak it into existence,
[00:36:40.479 --> 00:36:41.881]  I'm not vaccinated.
[00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:45.145]  I don't have the COVID vaccine.
[00:36:45.145 --> 00:36:49.490]  Maybe if I, maybe if I prelim for the phone call.
[00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.893]  Here, here.
[00:36:51.893 --> 00:36:55.037]  In case anyone from the federal government is listening.
[00:36:57.168 --> 00:37:05.214]  I have not had my COVID-19 vaccine, and I do not believe I will ever take my COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:37:05.214 --> 00:37:10.998]  If anyone from the federal government is listening right now, I am a non-vaccinated American.
[00:37:10.998 --> 00:37:16.642]  Oh!
[00:37:16.642 --> 00:37:21.165]  We're sorry, it is not necessary to dial a 1 when calling this number.
[00:37:21.165 --> 00:37:23.767]  Please hang up and try your call again.
[00:37:23.767 --> 00:37:26.529]  Guys, is that the same number we've been dialing with now a different message?
[00:37:29.878 --> 00:37:30.718]  It's always fun.
[00:37:30.718 --> 00:37:33.880]  Hey, it's a live show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.662]  Not scripted, not planned, no teleprompters here, just a live show.
[00:37:37.662 --> 00:37:42.205]  So now we've got a different voicemail from the CDC that we don't have to dial a 1.
[00:37:42.205 --> 00:37:44.546]  Let's give it one more go without the 1 this time then.
[00:37:44.546 --> 00:37:48.128]  Again, I'm not vaccinated.
[00:37:48.128 --> 00:37:51.530]  Anyone from the CDC wants to know.
[00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.672]  Owen Schroer here, not vaccinated.
[00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:56.173]  Don't want the vaccine.
[00:37:58.197 --> 00:38:00.319]  I don't want to take a vaccine.
[00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:01.219]  I never have.
[00:38:01.219 --> 00:38:04.542]  I'm not vaccinated, CDC.
[00:38:04.542 --> 00:38:12.848]  Am I on your database?
[00:38:12.848 --> 00:38:13.528]  We're sorry.
[00:38:13.528 --> 00:38:17.051]  It is not necessary to dial a 1 when calling this number.
[00:38:17.051 --> 00:38:18.232]  Did we dial a 1 that time?
[00:38:18.232 --> 00:38:22.495]  And try your call again.
[00:38:22.495 --> 00:38:24.236]  Well, let's just document that then, too.
[00:38:25.182 --> 00:38:27.443]  We'll just document that and then live on air.
[00:38:27.443 --> 00:38:35.446]  So, it's okay.
[00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:40.868]  That's what you get if you don't dial a 1.
[00:38:40.868 --> 00:38:45.630]  Well, I mean, I guess the CDC's lines are busy now.
[00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.971]  I guess the CDC's lines are all tied up now.
[00:38:47.971 --> 00:38:50.071]  Well, there you go.
[00:38:50.071 --> 00:38:53.433]  We'll see if they ever return a phone call or make a public statement.
[00:38:54.284 --> 00:38:57.465]  My guess is that they won't.
[00:38:57.465 --> 00:39:00.046]  And so there you go.
[00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:07.448]  But the nonsense coming from the vaccine pushers and their lack of logic just continues.
[00:39:07.448 --> 00:39:17.911]  Former Obama Administration Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says, unvaccinated Americans are like second-hand smoke.
[00:39:17.911 --> 00:39:20.491]  They can make me and my family sick.
[00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:22.492]  But you've been vaccinated, so how is that true?
[00:39:23.769 --> 00:39:33.035]  So they admit the vaccine doesn't work, and yet they want to force you to take the vaccine that doesn't work.
[00:39:33.035 --> 00:39:34.456]  Okay, you've been vaccinated.
[00:39:34.456 --> 00:39:35.637]  Can you still get COVID?
[00:39:35.637 --> 00:39:36.558]  Yes.
[00:39:36.558 --> 00:39:38.539]  Can you still be hospitalized with COVID?
[00:39:38.539 --> 00:39:39.379]  Yes.
[00:39:39.379 --> 00:39:41.001]  Can you still die from COVID?
[00:39:41.001 --> 00:39:41.861]  Yes.
[00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:43.562]  Can you still spread COVID?
[00:39:43.562 --> 00:39:45.664]  Yes.
[00:39:45.664 --> 00:39:47.525]  Can you die from the vaccine?
[00:39:47.525 --> 00:39:49.346]  Yes.
[00:39:49.346 --> 00:39:52.969]  You, the non-vaccinated, can you get COVID?
[00:39:52.969 --> 00:39:53.189]  Yes.
[00:39:55.794 --> 00:39:57.495]  Could you die from the vaccine?
[00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:59.815]  No.
[00:39:59.815 --> 00:40:01.316]  Oh.
[00:40:01.316 --> 00:40:02.216]  Hmm.
[00:40:02.216 --> 00:40:08.439]  Well, when you lay it out like that, when you put it to me that way, why should I get the vaccine?
[00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:09.639]  And they all admit it.
[00:40:09.639 --> 00:40:16.522]  Leanna Wynn goes on CNN and says, now the unvaccinated are at risk because of the vaccinated.
[00:40:16.522 --> 00:40:18.702]  The vaccinated caused the variants.
[00:40:18.702 --> 00:40:21.223]  The vaccinated are causing the spread.
[00:40:21.223 --> 00:40:25.465]  The vaccinated have way more complications with COVID now.
[00:40:26.508 --> 00:40:28.509]  Or if not, COVID from the vaccine.
[00:40:28.509 --> 00:40:31.011]  Or both.
[00:40:31.011 --> 00:40:32.592]  Here's another one.
[00:40:32.592 --> 00:40:39.076]  Antibodies in fully vaccinated with Pfizer and AstraZeneca decline after months.
[00:40:39.076 --> 00:40:44.119]  So they admit, oh, doesn't work, maybe you have immunity for a month, maybe not, who knows.
[00:40:44.119 --> 00:40:47.241]  But if you have natural immunity, you're solid.
[00:40:47.241 --> 00:40:50.683]  You're good.
[00:40:50.683 --> 00:40:51.163]  All good.
[00:40:53.717 --> 00:41:05.439]  In fact, I mean, again, it's like, there's so much tyranny now, you don't even want to talk about this stuff, but I was in direct contact, close contact with somebody that had COVID, was sick for COVID.
[00:41:05.439 --> 00:41:08.060]  They were actually a friend that was staying with me in my house.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.400]  So in my house, had COVID.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.261]  I never got COVID.
[00:41:13.261 --> 00:41:14.501]  Never got it.
[00:41:14.501 --> 00:41:15.341]  Why?
[00:41:15.341 --> 00:41:17.422]  Because I have natural immunity.
[00:41:17.422 --> 00:41:18.162]  See?
[00:41:18.162 --> 00:41:18.742]  See how that works?
[00:41:23.649 --> 00:41:29.580]  But this medical tyranny, it just has to stay and so we'll get into more of this coming up.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.764]  Democrats slip plans for $700,000 vaccine compliance fines.
[00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:36.274]  Compliance fines under U.S.
[00:41:36.274 --> 00:41:41.901]  Code section, say it with me, 666 into budget bill.
[00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:48.328]  So all these different COVID measures with 666 in it, it's almost like it's the mark of the beast coming here.
[00:41:48.328 --> 00:41:49.850]  We've been warned.
[00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:54.175]  So we'll have more of that coming up and Alex Jones coming up in the bottom of the hour here.
[00:41:55.216 --> 00:41:58.019]  Ladies and gentlemen, remember InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:41:58.019 --> 00:42:00.082]  We have new specials right now.
[00:42:00.082 --> 00:42:02.244]  Down and Out Liquid Sleep Support.
[00:42:02.244 --> 00:42:03.085]  Back in stock.
[00:42:03.085 --> 00:42:05.408]  Very, very powerful sleep support formula.
[00:42:05.408 --> 00:42:10.374]  This is probably the heaviest of the sleep support formulas that we have.
[00:42:10.374 --> 00:42:11.495]  And knockout is great.
[00:42:12.156 --> 00:42:13.257]  RocketRest is great.
[00:42:13.257 --> 00:42:17.219]  I have all three in my pantry, but Down-N-Out is definitely the most hard-hitting.
[00:42:17.219 --> 00:42:22.023]  It's back in stock, ladies and gentlemen, and 50% off right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:42:22.023 --> 00:42:22.963]  I'd stock up on this.
[00:42:22.963 --> 00:42:32.149]  If you're somebody that has trouble sleeping or just likes a little extra help to put you to sleep and keep you asleep, Down-N-Out is the sleep support formula you've been looking for.
[00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:35.171]  It's in a liquid tincture, so very easy to just take.
[00:42:35.171 --> 00:42:40.535]  I just take two droppers right under the tongue, swallow, and I'm good for however much sleep I need.
[00:42:42.196 --> 00:42:55.881]  The only problem is it knocks you out so good, maybe the next morning you're probably going to have to take some vitamin B12 or some Brain Force Plus or Brain Force Ultra from InfoWarsTore.com just to get the great sleep you just had behind you.
[00:42:55.881 --> 00:42:57.222]  But down and out, 50% off.
[00:42:57.222 --> 00:43:00.623]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad,
[00:43:01.463 --> 00:43:07.508]  Wait till they've got their world ID and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[00:43:07.508 --> 00:43:19.858]  And Klaus Schwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that once they've got you with that system then they're gonna carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do and
[00:43:20.418 --> 00:43:21.079]  We're good to go.
[00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:43.361]  Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[00:43:43.361 --> 00:43:46.664]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, and others leave the charts, along with Infowars.
[00:43:46.664 --> 00:43:47.665]  But it's not enough.
[00:43:47.665 --> 00:43:50.307]  Every individual has to not comply.
[00:43:50.307 --> 00:43:52.770]  And we have to talk about bringing the globalists to justice.
[00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.073]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them, legally and lawfully.
[00:43:56.943 --> 00:43:58.603]  I got some good news.
[00:43:58.603 --> 00:44:04.805]  All the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50% off at InfoWarshaw.com.
[00:44:04.805 --> 00:44:08.126]  The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out.
[00:44:08.126 --> 00:44:11.787]  So this sale is only going from one week starting on September 29th.
[00:44:11.787 --> 00:44:13.788]  And in the case of green fiber capsules,
[00:44:14.728 --> 00:44:17.069]  These will be sold out in just a couple days.
[00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:18.229]  50% off.
[00:44:18.229 --> 00:44:19.910]  We have knockout sleep aid.
[00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:20.490]  50% off.
[00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:21.710]  Sold out for months.
[00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:22.670]  Very popular.
[00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:24.251]  Twice as strong as knockout.
[00:44:24.251 --> 00:44:25.691]  Probably too strong for some people.
[00:44:25.691 --> 00:44:27.152]  Totally different formula.
[00:44:27.152 --> 00:44:28.372]  Down and out is back in stock.
[00:44:28.372 --> 00:44:29.452]  50% off.
[00:44:29.452 --> 00:44:31.313]  We've extended the sale on winter sun.
[00:44:31.653 --> 00:44:32.173]  We're good to go.
[00:44:58.499 --> 00:45:03.101]  You want to have double-blind, randomized placebo testing.
[00:45:03.101 --> 00:45:17.467]  What that means is you give 20,000 people the vaccine when it comes to phase 2, phase 3 trials, and you give 20,000 people a placebo, and then you really look at health outcomes for a long period of time, not four weeks.
[00:45:18.955 --> 00:45:23.198]  A lot of these injuries, the autoimmune injuries, you're not going to see in four weeks.
[00:45:23.198 --> 00:45:26.120]  The cancer, you're not going to see in four weeks.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:32.704]  And many of the neurological injuries, you won't see for four weeks, if the experience with other vaccines is instructive.
[00:45:33.979 --> 00:45:43.146]  You look at the other vaccines that are currently in the schedule, and there's about 400 injuries, illnesses, chronic illnesses that are listed.
[00:45:43.146 --> 00:45:44.347]  Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:45:44.347 --> 00:45:49.451]  is just one of more than 40 powerful voices in the film, Covidland.
[00:45:49.451 --> 00:45:51.953]  Exclusively available at covidland.com.
[00:45:51.953 --> 00:45:56.336]  And when you order it now, you get a free copy of Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:45:58.277 --> 00:46:04.664]  Around the world, the general public has woken up to the fact that this isn't a left or right issue.
[00:46:04.664 --> 00:46:11.371]  This is a global, corporate, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, Great Reset, Takeover.
[00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:12.533]  This is a technocracy.
[00:46:13.789 --> 00:46:21.615]  But very few leaders, Orban, Bolsonaro, and just a few others, are addressing it for what it is to their people.
[00:46:21.615 --> 00:46:29.160]  A foreign, anti-human, anti-family, anti-God takeover of the very biological system of humans.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:36.666]  This is a corporate takeover of our bodies, of our cells, with the World ID, the medical tracking system, that'll be tied to the carbon taxes.
[00:46:36.666 --> 00:46:38.187]  It's all been announced.
[00:46:38.187 --> 00:46:39.328]  It is a dystopic
[00:46:40.157 --> 00:46:43.980]  Nightmare, and humanity is starting to organize, but our leaders aren't.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:47:01.793]  We need Senator Paul, and Senator Holly, and others that have shown some understanding of this, and Senator Cruz, to organize against this foreign, multinational, corporate takeover through Big Pharma, Big Banks, and Big Tech, or we have no hope!
[00:47:01.793 --> 00:47:04.475]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:11.528 --> 00:47:14.169]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:14.169 --> 00:47:20.970]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.110]  It's Thursday, September 30th, 2021.
[00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:34.973]  And the battle plans the UN and their minions around the world have had on the drawing board is now being implemented.
[00:47:37.472 --> 00:47:57.057]  From Australia to Canada to the United States, from the UK to the EU, all major governments, more than 16 months ago, began building giant, new, huge holding towns or cities that could hold between 5,000 and 30,000 people.
[00:48:01.115 --> 00:48:29.705]  And starting about 14 months ago, the CDC put out a document that deals with, quote, the shielding approach, which is a direct adoption of the United Nations plan of the head of UN Rapid Reaction Force, Dr. Ryan, to, quote, shield populations that, quote, do not have COVID or the literature influenza-like viruses from the, quote, rest of the population.
[00:48:30.953 --> 00:48:33.535]  Who are the unvaccinated?
[00:48:33.535 --> 00:48:51.748]  Now, I'm going to go through the different reasons for doing this, but the next phase is to begin locking people up for their, quote, safety, to break that taboo and set the precedent to live in a permanent maximum North Korea style police state that Australia is the test case for.
[00:48:53.905 --> 00:48:58.427]  That will then organize the mass of people to want to persecute the unvaccinated.
[00:48:58.427 --> 00:49:00.267]  And we already predicted this a year and a half ago.
[00:49:00.267 --> 00:49:02.248]  We said they're going to roll out the so-called vaccine.
[00:49:02.248 --> 00:49:03.569]  It's going to make the vaccinated sick.
[00:49:03.569 --> 00:49:05.289]  That's what all the top scientists said it would do.
[00:49:05.289 --> 00:49:07.130]  And they're going to blame the unvaccinated.
[00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:09.391]  This is all elementary.
[00:49:09.391 --> 00:49:11.612]  A five-year-old can understand it.
[00:49:11.612 --> 00:49:20.755]  If you aren't naive and actually understand the historical lens we're looking through and know the full spectrum of globalist public preparations, because this is going
[00:49:22.119 --> 00:49:28.981]  From the drawing board to operationals, let me just be very, very clear and then I'll walk through the guts of this.
[00:49:28.981 --> 00:49:36.964]  Biden has announced under his new spending bill, almost $4 trillion, build back better.
[00:49:36.964 --> 00:49:41.466]  That's like a Nazi Germany saying, I'm Volk, I'm Reich, I'm Fuhrer.
[00:49:41.466 --> 00:49:45.007]  Or that's like a NASCAR having a slogan for NASCAR.
[00:49:45.007 --> 00:49:47.648]  That's like having in the NFL a slogan for the NFL.
[00:49:48.999 --> 00:49:51.800]  Or a slogan for, you know, Coca-Cola, Coke is it.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:50:04.385]  When they say, build back better, he's calling legislation that, it means imploding our economy, shutting down our industrial economy, and bringing in the quote, green economy, which will cause total societal collapse and feudalism.
[00:50:04.385 --> 00:50:13.409]  So it's an environmental cover for a Marxist-Leninist, great leap forward, cultural revolution, like Mao carried out in China, or Lenin and Stalin carried out
[00:50:15.188 --> 00:50:20.092]  Starting in Russia in 1917, it really took them 15 years to consolidate control of Russia.
[00:50:20.092 --> 00:50:23.955]  And they even admit it's a Stalinist, Leninist, Maoist system.
[00:50:23.955 --> 00:50:28.698]  So, first they have all the racial divisions, divide and conquer us.
[00:50:28.698 --> 00:50:34.903]  They ship the jobs overseas, they de-industrialize the country, then they create vaccine mandates to run the government below the military and the police.
[00:50:34.903 --> 00:50:37.365]  They have the abolish the police movement to get control of the police.
[00:50:39.022 --> 00:50:47.888]  They open the borders up, they flood the country, collapse it using cloud and pivot, they devalue the currency while the big corporations buy up all the infrastructure.
[00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:56.871]  They built giant prisons, supposedly, for all the criminals, but then empty those out under COVID and then announced that it's actually for the general public.
[00:50:56.871 --> 00:50:58.492]  And again, there's no simple way to tackle all this.
[00:50:58.492 --> 00:51:00.473]  I'm just gonna dump all the information on the table.
[00:51:00.473 --> 00:51:01.894]  You can make what you want.
[00:51:01.894 --> 00:51:14.762]  But what I'm getting at here, and what I do announce just up front, is that all the FEMA camp programs and all the Roundup camp programs and all of those systems they've been quietly preparing since the days of Rex 84 in the 1980s, under different pretenses,
[00:51:18.391 --> 00:51:21.414]  is now being officially rolled out worldwide.
[00:51:21.414 --> 00:51:32.825]  They're building giant emergency centers, and they're calling them shield-in-place centers, where again, they talk about locking down neighborhoods, locking down whole cities.
[00:51:32.825 --> 00:51:37.809]  They talk about forcibly quarantining the unvaccinated, but also, quote, shielding everyone else
[00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:42.693]  Inside sports stadiums or inside military bases to quote protect them.
[00:51:42.693 --> 00:51:44.735]  Now that'll destroy confidence in the economy.
[00:51:44.735 --> 00:51:46.936]  It'll collapse all the small businesses forever.
[00:51:46.936 --> 00:51:50.279]  It'll make the lockdowns of a year ago look tame in comparison.
[00:51:50.279 --> 00:51:58.865]  And then out of that only the Walmarts, only the Amazons, only the big chain stores will be able to survive and thrive because they'll be all that's left of the economy.
[00:51:58.865 --> 00:51:59.346]  So that's one
[00:52:00.199 --> 00:52:00.499]  I don't
[00:52:21.664 --> 00:52:39.212]  Stating that is going to be $700,000 fines to businesses that don't take the poison unauthorized unapproved shot They are saying that under infrastructure emergencies They're going to just take over warehouses and trucking when all that breaks down because Amazon and Google and
[00:52:41.263 --> 00:52:45.327]  Walmart and Target and H-E-B and all them will be able to keep operating.
[00:52:45.327 --> 00:52:53.694]  They have InfraGard infrastructure protection agreements with FEMA that goes back to the 1980s that were made public in the 2000s.
[00:52:53.694 --> 00:53:03.964]  And so again, it's corporations, global corporations, creating an emergency to shut down the economy and basically have a hostile takeover of the entire system.
[00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:05.743]  I think
[00:53:23.447 --> 00:53:28.851]  So long and short of it is, Biden's controllers wear a rainbow swastika symbol, a rainbow sun symbol, and when you go to each part of that colored rainbow,
[00:53:53.647 --> 00:54:01.489]  It has a different area of the authoritarian corporate takeover system when you look at the pie chart.
[00:54:01.489 --> 00:54:11.592]  And when Biden announced in his spending bill Build Back Better, he 100% adopted the globalist slogan of Klaus Schwab.
[00:54:12.526 --> 00:54:12.726]  Builder
[00:54:31.229 --> 00:54:51.395]  is between the United States and the EU and all of the Anglo-American countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, under this globalist dictatorship, not to empower the West, but to subserve the West and go back pre-Magna Carta, pre-Renaissance and again bring us back into a feudal state.
[00:54:51.395 --> 00:54:52.115]  That's actually
[00:54:53.672 --> 00:54:58.978]  In Endgame 2, it's internet only, that I haven't been able to find for years.
[00:54:58.978 --> 00:55:10.710]  Somebody found it and posted it last night on Band.Video under another name, an alternate name that was called in another upload we did years ago, called Endgame, The Blueprint of Mad Men.
[00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:13.713]  And it's got a lot of that information in it, but I'm digressing here.
[00:55:15.663 --> 00:55:17.384]  There's no easy way to go over all this.
[00:55:17.384 --> 00:55:20.545]  This is just basically the end of America, as you know it.
[00:55:20.545 --> 00:55:22.286]  Every time you comply, it only gets worse.
[00:55:22.286 --> 00:55:24.047]  15 days to flatten the curve.
[00:55:24.047 --> 00:55:28.309]  Again, 500 plus days of the beginning of the end of your life.
[00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:29.349]  They want to bring you to your knees.
[00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:30.730]  They want to bankrupt you.
[00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:33.631]  They want to be able to socially engineer you in to do that.
[00:55:33.631 --> 00:55:35.552]  They've got to make you dependent.
[00:55:35.552 --> 00:55:37.373]  And so, it's about corporate power.
[00:55:37.373 --> 00:55:41.875]  It's about the corporations implementing this regardless
[00:55:43.669 --> 00:55:43.729]  I'm
[00:56:03.584 --> 00:56:05.745]  Come out and announce, okay, $700,000 fines.
[00:56:05.745 --> 00:56:08.166]  We don't take the injections for businesses.
[00:56:08.166 --> 00:56:11.127]  And anyone that doesn't go along with this, you're the reason everybody's sick.
[00:56:11.127 --> 00:56:13.147]  Well, it's really the vaccines.
[00:56:13.147 --> 00:56:21.510]  And we're going to have to end this by basically locking everything down once and for all and ending this, because it's all your fault for not submitting to us that this happened.
[00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:24.051]  That'll play everybody off against each other.
[00:56:24.051 --> 00:56:30.594]  And then out of that, it permanently breaks the economy and the cloud pivot strategy to take over our civilization.
[00:56:31.414 --> 00:56:39.538]  And it's a worldwide plan, and it's totally evil, and we'll basically never come out of it if we accept it.
[00:56:39.538 --> 00:56:56.145]  And again, they're hiring now hundreds of thousands of people and tens of thousands of managers to orchestrate and run all the sheltering in place, shield in place programs, and they've put out the federal ads for that on a state-by-state basis.
[00:56:56.145 --> 00:56:58.206]  Thousands for this state, thousands for that state.
[00:56:59.026 --> 00:57:03.528]  And they're going to go ahead with this, again, to totally break the economy, consolidate power.
[00:57:03.528 --> 00:57:04.509]  This is war.
[00:57:04.509 --> 00:57:09.972]  This is a globalist occupation force that is dissolving the very nation's existence.
[00:57:09.972 --> 00:57:15.575]  And everybody better understand, who thinks they're part of the establishment, you're going to get run over and destroyed by this process as well.
[00:57:15.575 --> 00:57:27.621]  They're then going to reorganize the global economy under the Great Reset and make even the ultra-rich and quote, wealthy, hand over most of their wealth to this big globalist, fascist, communist consortium of the ultra-super-rich, which will then
[00:57:28.101 --> 00:57:31.884]  Actually give some of that money to the lower class, but it's going to be devalued.
[00:57:31.884 --> 00:57:35.327]  And then the lower class will then be fully weaponized for the next phase.
[00:57:35.327 --> 00:57:37.648]  Basically a giant malice revolution.
[00:57:37.648 --> 00:57:41.231]  Alright, back to Owen Schroeder and the live broadcast.
[00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:42.112]  God bless and good luck.
[00:57:47.316 --> 00:57:53.258]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems of these employees.
[00:57:53.258 --> 00:58:04.061]  Because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[00:58:04.061 --> 00:58:07.402]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[00:58:07.402 --> 00:58:09.002]  That taxes the heart.
[00:58:09.002 --> 00:58:10.383]  It taxes the lungs.
[00:58:10.383 --> 00:58:12.203]  And we have given people heart attacks.
[00:58:12.203 --> 00:58:13.484]  By allowing them to work,
[00:58:14.384 --> 00:58:21.710]  With our mouth and nose covered, with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:23.912]  The globalists have told us we're a disease.
[00:58:23.912 --> 00:58:25.813]  They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[00:58:25.813 --> 00:58:34.760]  And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up to one-third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.402]  This is a sick cult and we've got to say no.
[00:58:37.402 --> 00:58:40.905]  But the only way the real science gets out to the public is if we tell them.
[00:58:41.365 --> 00:58:44.548]  Get your copy today of COVIDLAND and expose them.
[00:58:44.548 --> 00:58:45.829]  It's covidland.com.
[00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:48.251]  Go there now.
[00:58:48.251 --> 00:58:50.893]  My business model is very, very simple.
[00:58:50.893 --> 00:58:58.300]  I want to bring you products that work really, really well at affordable prices that are competitive so that you'll shop with us.
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:08.248]  And so we form a relationship so we're able to stay on air and fight the globalists and have good products that make us healthy, make us wiser, that boost our immune system.
[00:59:08.248 --> 00:59:09.009]  And that's what we've done.
[00:59:09.389 --> 00:59:13.452]  Now one area of the immune system we don't talk enough about is deep restful sleep.
[00:59:13.452 --> 00:59:14.733]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:59:14.733 --> 00:59:17.815]  The effects of deep restful sleep on health and the immune system.
[00:59:17.815 --> 00:59:23.099]  And so with everything we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D and zinc and all of it, that's great.
[00:59:23.099 --> 00:59:26.281]  But deep restful sleep is just as important, maybe more important,
[00:59:26.721 --> 00:59:35.307]  So, InfoWarsTore.com now can announce 50% off on our best-selling product, Down and Out, that just came back in after four months being sold out.

[00:59:51.239 --> 00:59:53.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:21.253]  We're into our number two of the Alex Jones Show here today.
[01:00:21.253 --> 01:00:29.420]  Let me do this before I get back into the stacks of news.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:41.230]  It's a very complex thing, but it can be boiled down into a simple way to understand it with the global government, the corporate world government.
[01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:50.274]  They're so powerful, they have so much leverage over the free market that they have no use for the useless eater anymore, for the consumer.
[01:00:50.274 --> 01:00:53.796]  So it's a corporate world government takeover.
[01:00:53.796 --> 01:01:05.903]  At the very core of it is a eugenics-based program where they have decided that they are the enlightened ones and there is a limited amount of resources on earth.
[01:01:06.994 --> 01:01:19.900]  Meaning there is a timetable for humans on planet Earth and so therefore they have deemed themselves as the management, if you will, of planet Earth and by
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:49.202]  their rulings or measurements they've just decided we have too many people so we're gonna call the people planet earth that's the only way we can sustain humanity on planet earth is by killing humanity on planet earth and they will release their white papers and they mention this during TED talks but they don't really get serious and tell you about it because well then you would stand up against it and say no I want to live and so they're really targeting the youth with this because
[01:01:51.095 --> 01:02:14.003]  It's the youth that doesn't have instilled in them the values of freedom and independence and liberty, and now you're two or three generations removed from war heroes, and it's maybe rarer now that you come from a line of people that fought in a war or fought for America or died for America, so they just don't care.
[01:02:16.195 --> 01:02:41.114]  And Greta Thunberg is one of the people that they're using for this and she spoke and so I don't usually like to cover Greta Thunberg for obvious reasons but I thought I should play this climate summit that she spoke at and just a little clip from her speech to just show you how clown worldish it actually is and and how it's actually debasing human knowledge.
[01:02:41.114 --> 01:02:42.274]  But see humans have to be
[01:02:43.487 --> 01:02:49.555]  Less empowered by knowledge and information in order for the New World Order to be successfully carried out.
[01:02:49.555 --> 01:02:56.424]  Because if you're actually informed and a thinker, or tuned into God, the Creator, well then you wouldn't stand for any of this at all.
[01:02:57.765 --> 01:03:04.028]  And of course, that's the big separation with people who believe in population control or eugenics, is they're not Christians.
[01:03:04.028 --> 01:03:05.289]  Or they're not religious at all.
[01:03:05.289 --> 01:03:06.910]  They don't believe in God the Creator.
[01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:15.675]  When you do believe in God the Creator, you understand that you put your faith in that, and your faith in God, and once you've even lived that life, you understand how it works.
[01:03:15.675 --> 01:03:18.816]  It's a mystical thing, but it's very real.
[01:03:18.816 --> 01:03:20.297]  It's almost like karma.
[01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.959]  But, here's Greta Thunberg.
[01:03:22.959 --> 01:03:25.080]  Listen to how dumb this is.
[01:03:26.264 --> 01:03:32.947]  And it's first the dumbness of it where she literally says blah blah blah and gets a standing ovation.
[01:03:32.947 --> 01:03:34.288]  Not even kidding you.
[01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:37.470]  And then the cult-level programming of it at the end.
[01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:43.793]  Here's a short clip of Greta Thunberg's speech from a climate committee this week.
[01:03:43.793 --> 01:03:45.373]  There is no planet blah.
[01:03:45.373 --> 01:03:46.334]  Blah blah blah.
[01:03:46.334 --> 01:03:47.194]  Blah blah blah.
[01:03:52.304 --> 01:04:10.674]  I mean, it's, folks, it's mental illness level stuff.
[01:04:10.674 --> 01:04:12.015]  And see, I actually feel bad.
[01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:17.578]  I mean, usually I'm the guy that'll say retarded and not feel any qualms about it because it's a word.
[01:04:19.143 --> 01:04:24.105]  But Greta Thunberg may actually have like actual diagnosable mental disabilities and so I feel bad.
[01:04:24.105 --> 01:04:26.586]  I'm not going to sit here and say, oh look, that's retard level.
[01:04:26.586 --> 01:04:29.127]  She might actually have mental disabilities.
[01:04:29.127 --> 01:04:34.709]  But see, they use her and they use the ignorance of the youth.
[01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:40.281]  And they use the inexperience of the youth to just buy all of these lies.
[01:04:40.281 --> 01:04:42.764]  But you can see how debased it is.
[01:04:42.764 --> 01:04:49.792]  And you can see how unintellectual it is when she says, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:04:49.792 --> 01:04:55.940]  And then they have their little cult-like programming at the end, too, where they cheer and say exactly what she says.
[01:04:58.322 --> 01:05:03.704]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered?
[01:05:03.704 --> 01:05:05.765]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store?
[01:05:05.765 --> 01:05:07.486]  Do you think they would let you in?
[01:05:07.486 --> 01:05:12.128]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting?
[01:05:12.128 --> 01:05:20.432]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on?
[01:05:20.432 --> 01:05:22.053]  How far do you think that would get you?
[01:05:22.053 --> 01:05:26.635]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space
[01:05:27.415 --> 01:05:28.316]  Alien?
[01:05:28.316 --> 01:05:35.442]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[01:05:35.442 --> 01:05:39.125]  The globalists are running a psychological war for operational humanity.
[01:05:39.125 --> 01:05:41.887]  Only waking up to the Great Reset and its tyranny will save us.
[01:05:42.668 --> 01:05:44.949]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[01:05:44.949 --> 01:05:50.951]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud, and that it's dangerous, and that it causes major medical issues, and it's dehumanizing.
[01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:52.512]  And the film COVIDland does that.

[01:06:01.956 --> 01:06:07.438]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer.
[01:06:07.438 --> 01:06:10.219]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:12.008 --> 01:06:21.297]  I'll tell you what, we've been talking the COVID tyranny and stuff for most of this hour and so I want to just switch lanes here.
[01:06:21.297 --> 01:06:23.318]  And of course we will get back to it, it's the big story.
[01:06:23.318 --> 01:06:30.665]  Oh, not to mention, we do have Joe Hoff from the Gateway Pundit joining me in the one o'clock central hour, so in the third hour today.
[01:06:30.665 --> 01:06:32.887]  Looking forward to talking to Joe.
[01:06:32.887 --> 01:06:34.549]  But let me just switch lanes for a second here.
[01:06:36.638 --> 01:06:39.739]  The Congressional Baseball Game.
[01:06:39.739 --> 01:06:42.260]  A tradition in Washington, D.C.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:45.281]  for Congress.
[01:06:45.281 --> 01:06:52.504]  And it's amazing to think about how you had the Congressional Baseball Game back this year.
[01:06:52.504 --> 01:06:59.186]  And we don't even talk about the attempt of mass murder that happened, what was it, four years ago, I believe?
[01:06:59.186 --> 01:07:00.587]  At the Congressional Baseball Game?
[01:07:00.587 --> 01:07:00.927]  That's right.
[01:07:00.927 --> 01:07:03.448]  An attempted mass murder by a Democrat?
[01:07:03.448 --> 01:07:04.308]  By a liberal progressive?
[01:07:05.725 --> 01:07:07.305]  Do we forget about James Hodgkinson?
[01:07:07.305 --> 01:07:13.387]  Do we forget about how he tried to commit a mass shooting at the Republican baseball practice?
[01:07:13.387 --> 01:07:15.767]  Do we remember that?
[01:07:15.767 --> 01:07:18.548]  The media didn't even cover it at the time.
[01:07:18.548 --> 01:07:21.049]  They covered it up.
[01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:22.769]  Yeah, I'll play Whataboutism.
[01:07:22.769 --> 01:07:30.251]  Can you imagine if somebody showed up to the Democrat baseball practice in a Trump hat and tried to commit a mass murder and a mass shooting?
[01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:38.337]  Every year during the Congressional Baseball game, they'd make it all about that, and they'd do ceremonies and everything, and they'd be honoring the Democrats that shot.
[01:07:38.337 --> 01:07:45.443]  But no, because it was a Democrat that attempted mass murder, and because it was Republicans that got shot, the media's not interested in covering that.
[01:07:45.443 --> 01:07:47.745]  They cover it up.
[01:07:47.745 --> 01:07:58.315]  So they don't celebrate Steve Scalise being back healthy, able to attend and play the Congressional Baseball game, or Rand Paul, or all the Republicans that were attempted to be murdered that day.
[01:07:59.946 --> 01:08:06.388]  They don't make a big thing of it, but that's what it was.
[01:08:06.388 --> 01:08:08.409]  Could you say the New York Times inspired it?
[01:08:08.409 --> 01:08:16.931]  The New York Times writes a story saying, hey look, there's a Republican baseball practice at this field and there's no security.
[01:08:16.931 --> 01:08:24.213]  And then a reader of the New York Times and a liberal progressive Democrat, James Hoskinson, drives from Missouri to D.C.
[01:08:24.213 --> 01:08:27.054]  with his rifle and attempts mass murder in a mass shooting.
[01:08:27.054 --> 01:08:29.055]  And the media doesn't cover it because he's a Democrat.
[01:08:29.827 --> 01:08:32.990]  So again, a Republican, a Conservative does that, you would never hear the end of it.
[01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:40.056]  But because a Democrat and a Liberal does it, oh, we don't talk about that, we don't cover that, we're not going to mention that.
[01:08:40.056 --> 01:08:42.018]  But we will!
[01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:56.750]  Yes, Democrat and media-inspired James Hodgkinson tried to commit mass murder, tried to commit a mass shooting at the Republican baseball practice before the Congressional baseball game.
[01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:58.072]  That's an actual terrorist.
[01:08:59.022 --> 01:09:04.628]  They always seem to wind up on one side of the aisle, don't they?
[01:09:04.628 --> 01:09:10.494]  So, you had that happen, and the congressional baseball game, though, went off without a hitch.
[01:09:10.494 --> 01:09:13.577]  You had the first home run from Greg Stubbe.
[01:09:13.577 --> 01:09:14.458]  Is it Stube or Stubbe?
[01:09:14.458 --> 01:09:20.364]  I don't even know, but a Republican representative actually hit a home run over the fence for the first time in almost 60 years, I think it was.
[01:09:23.311 --> 01:09:31.860]  Perhaps the highlight was, once again, Joe Biden showing up and doing what Joe Biden does best, and that's getting booed and then harassing women.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:32.801]  We've got both of that.
[01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:43.153]  Here is, in clip three, guys, Joe Biden arrives and gets introduced to the congressional baseball game, and this is what it sounded like.
[01:09:51.865 --> 01:09:58.288]  Joe, you suck!
[01:09:58.288 --> 01:10:02.689]  Boy, that's about a crowd of 10,000 people there booing Joe Biden in D.C.
[01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:04.030]  at the Nationals ballpark.
[01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:13.934]  Now, I have not been able to... Yeah, there's the bomb from Stoobie.
[01:10:13.934 --> 01:10:14.734]  Into the front row.
[01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:22.695]  He was wearing a Save America hat, by the way, so it empowered him to hit a 400-foot bomb.
[01:10:22.695 --> 01:10:26.316]  But no, okay, so there's Joe Biden, he shows up, he gets booed.
[01:10:26.316 --> 01:10:34.299]  Now, I have not been able to, I don't know anybody who's been able to identify who this lady is that Biden was harassing last night, but...
[01:10:36.001 --> 01:10:42.545]  Biden, in typical Biden fashion, shows up, a stadium of 10,000 people, in Washington, D.C., mind you.
[01:10:42.545 --> 01:10:56.394]  In Washington, D.C., mind you, he gets booed out of the building, and then he finds the first young woman he can to go harass, and he creeps up behind her, and then boxes her in, and as you can see here,
[01:10:57.478 --> 01:11:01.121]  She's standing against the railing of the dugout.
[01:11:01.121 --> 01:11:07.226]  Biden creeps up from behind her, puts his arms around her, and grabs the railing to box her in.
[01:11:07.226 --> 01:11:10.229]  This is a total creep move.
[01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:15.653]  This is a harasser, abuser move from Joe Biden.
[01:11:15.653 --> 01:11:17.655]  Oh, and yeah, I forgot.
[01:11:17.655 --> 01:11:20.738]  Where's the mask, Joe?
[01:11:20.738 --> 01:11:21.859]  Where's your mask, Joe?
[01:11:25.011 --> 01:11:26.851]  Pelosi's out there without a mask.
[01:11:26.851 --> 01:11:31.232]  There's a funny video of her on the phone, like, screaming at somebody.
[01:11:31.232 --> 01:11:31.812]  No masks.
[01:11:31.812 --> 01:11:33.132]  None of them were wearing masks.
[01:11:33.132 --> 01:11:39.113]  I guess they didn't realize that the cameras were on and that C-SPAN was doing a live broadcast of the baseball game.
[01:11:39.113 --> 01:11:43.314]  Because all the Democrats that tell you you need to wear masks weren't wearing masks.
[01:11:43.314 --> 01:11:45.295]  And they didn't even double mask, folks.
[01:11:45.295 --> 01:11:46.955]  Not even a single triple mask out there.
[01:11:46.955 --> 01:11:49.915]  Not even a triple job.
[01:11:49.915 --> 01:11:50.936]  Not even the dub deuce.
[01:11:55.057 --> 01:11:57.259]  So who knows what Pelosi's screaming.
[01:11:57.259 --> 01:12:01.823]  And there's also a clip of Pelosi from this morning appearing to be drunk, by the way.
[01:12:01.823 --> 01:12:03.365]  We may play that coming up.
[01:12:03.365 --> 01:12:07.789]  Just totals, just weirdness coming from this woman, this deranged lunatic.
[01:12:07.789 --> 01:12:13.154]  But so Biden shows up, a crowd of 10,000 in Washington, D.C.
[01:12:13.154 --> 01:12:13.795]  boos him.
[01:12:15.051 --> 01:12:23.900]  And then he goes and finds the first victim he can for his harassment and he boxes her in by putting his arms against the railing so she can't escape.
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:28.665]  A total pervert, harasser, serial harasser move.
[01:12:28.665 --> 01:12:31.969]  But that's creepy Uncle Joe.
[01:12:31.969 --> 01:12:33.611]  That's creepy Uncle Grandpa Joe.
[01:12:35.256 --> 01:12:48.847]  And so we know about the perversions, the sexual perversions of his family, so it shouldn't surprise anybody that Joe Biden had to creep on that lady and then boxed her in with his arms after getting booed.
[01:12:48.847 --> 01:12:50.208]  So again, I'm not sure who it is.
[01:12:50.208 --> 01:13:01.557]  I don't know if anybody has been able to ID her, but Biden certainly ID'd her and he got right up in her face, right up behind her and boxed her in and he had a great time with it because he's all-powerful.
[01:13:01.557 --> 01:13:02.338]  He can harass women.
[01:13:02.338 --> 01:13:03.258]  He's like the Cuomos.
[01:13:04.215 --> 01:13:07.838]  Yeah, we seriously harass women.
[01:13:07.838 --> 01:13:11.621]  Yeah, I grab women's buttocks at the bar.
[01:13:11.621 --> 01:13:12.782]  That's me!
[01:13:12.782 --> 01:13:13.802]  A Democrat!
[01:13:13.802 --> 01:13:16.104]  Cuomo!
[01:13:16.104 --> 01:13:19.106]  And then, it was out of Slate Magazine.
[01:13:19.106 --> 01:13:20.527]  I covered this on the War Room.
[01:13:20.527 --> 01:13:22.429]  Didn't really hear anybody else cover it, quite frankly.
[01:13:22.429 --> 01:13:25.191]  A couple people out there covered it.
[01:13:25.191 --> 01:13:32.537]  But it pretty much went uncovered how the actual grassroots members of the Me Too, Time's Up movement
[01:13:33.464 --> 01:13:50.060]  Have completely rebuked it now because most recently with the accusers of Cuomo, they found out that Time's Up and Me Too were using their funds to pay people to go after the women that accused Cuomo.
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:51.561]  The women!
[01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:53.303]  Not Cuomo, the victims of Cuomo!
[01:13:54.485 --> 01:13:59.927]  So they wrote a huge piece in Slate Magazine saying, what happened to the Time's Up movement?
[01:13:59.927 --> 01:14:06.450]  And it gets all about how they basically discovered that at the top level it was a grift, the big executives at these
[01:14:07.395 --> 01:14:12.679]  Movements were just making a bunch of money, and how it was really just a Democrat front group.
[01:14:12.679 --> 01:14:13.579]  And they just admit all of it!
[01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:21.325]  This is coming from Democrats that were involved getting in for the right reasons, thinking, hey, we're not going to have people harassing women anymore, men of power harassing women.
[01:14:21.325 --> 01:14:26.228]  They got in it for that reason, and then they discovered it was all a lie!
[01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:31.832]  They discovered it was all a lie, and when they went to attack the women
[01:14:33.397 --> 01:14:39.880]  Of the women that accused Cuomo, that's when they realized that they had been completely duped.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.821]  No, it was always a Democrat front.
[01:14:42.821 --> 01:14:48.663]  It was always a Democrat operation and its real agenda was just to get Trump.
[01:14:48.663 --> 01:14:50.104]  So they found that out the hard way.
[01:14:51.892 --> 01:14:58.294]  Now, of course, InfoWars told you that from day one, but that's just the pace of play around here.
[01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:00.755]  And so that's why it's important to keep InfoWars on air.
[01:15:00.755 --> 01:15:05.416]  That's why the New World Order wants us off the air as much as they want anything else.
[01:15:05.416 --> 01:15:08.697]  They'd love to see Alex Jones and InfoWars off the air.
[01:15:08.697 --> 01:15:18.760]  But because of your prayers and your support, your word of mouth, and your spreading the links and telling friends and family about the videos, and your financial support by shopping at InfoWarsStore.com, we're still here, we're still ticking.

[01:16:36.343 --> 01:16:38.926]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:16:38.926 --> 01:16:40.428]  They know you're angry.
[01:16:40.428 --> 01:16:45.233]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[01:17:57.734 --> 01:18:13.987]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[01:18:13.987 --> 01:18:17.649]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:24.355]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[01:18:24.955 --> 01:18:29.036]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[01:18:29.036 --> 01:18:31.777]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.

[01:18:35.799 --> 01:18:43.182]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[01:18:43.182 --> 01:18:47.163]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the InfoWare.
[01:18:50.024 --> 01:18:59.369]  I got some good news.
[01:18:59.369 --> 01:19:05.571]  All the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:05.571 --> 01:19:08.893]  The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out.
[01:19:08.893 --> 01:19:12.535]  So this sale is only going from one week starting on September 29th.
[01:19:12.535 --> 01:19:14.556]  And in the case of green fiber capsules,
[01:19:15.476 --> 01:19:17.819]  These will be sold out in just a couple days.
[01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:18.980]  50% off.

[01:19:21.262 --> 01:19:22.463]  Sold out for months.
[01:19:22.463 --> 01:19:23.424]  Very popular.
[01:19:23.424 --> 01:19:25.006]  Twice as strong as Knockout.
[01:19:25.006 --> 01:19:26.467]  Probably too strong for some people.
[01:19:26.467 --> 01:19:27.929]  Totally different formula.
[01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:29.150]  Down and Out is back in stock.
[01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:30.211]  50% off.
[01:19:30.211 --> 01:19:33.575]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12.
[01:19:33.575 --> 01:19:34.175]  50% off.

[01:19:37.679 --> 01:19:41.180]  It's all 40 to 50% off for one week only.

[01:19:42.981 --> 01:19:44.421]  And I thank you all for your support.
[01:19:44.421 --> 01:19:49.783]  InfoWarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:49.783 --> 01:19:50.683]  It's a win-win.
[01:19:50.683 --> 01:19:54.905]  These are things that make you healthy, make your life better, and they fund the InfoWar.
[01:19:54.905 --> 01:20:00.827]  Again, the only way we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[01:20:00.827 --> 01:20:03.508]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.329 --> 01:20:27.538]  Ah, the great Eric Clapton.
[01:20:27.538 --> 01:20:31.121]  Maybe the best guitar player, maybe the best slow hand guitar player of all time.
[01:20:31.121 --> 01:20:35.545]  And the COVID vaccine almost destroyed that for the world.
[01:20:37.403 --> 01:20:38.384]  I got to see Eric Clapton.
[01:20:38.384 --> 01:20:40.825]  He came to Austin about a month ago.
[01:20:40.825 --> 01:20:44.627]  And, uh, COVID vaccine almost ruined that experience for me.
[01:20:44.627 --> 01:20:55.574]  He said the COVID vaccine almost made it that he could never play guitar again, but luckily he recovered from the vaccine, which is now a thousand times more deadly than COVID.
[01:20:55.574 --> 01:20:57.095]  That's right.
[01:20:57.095 --> 01:21:03.079]  The name of the Gregory's report at band dot video, the vaccines are 1000 more deadly than COVID-19.
[01:21:03.079 --> 01:21:04.660]  Here's the latest report from Gregory's.
[01:21:11.644 --> 01:21:19.967]  Many are now awakened to the harsh reality of depopulation and democide, which we find ourselves in today.
[01:21:19.967 --> 01:21:22.588]  And the endgame is out in the open.
[01:21:22.588 --> 01:21:28.389]  To destroy humanity under the guise of transhumanism.
[01:21:28.389 --> 01:21:36.792]  What we've unfortunately learned is that there is an overwhelming herd of us who will do whatever they are told by the system.
[01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:39.213]  Which explains how we've gotten this far.
[01:21:40.728 --> 01:21:50.455]  There are seemingly millions who will believe whatever pop culture tells them, including the mass denial of natural health and immunity.
[01:21:50.455 --> 01:22:03.245]  While attempting to criminalize a knowledge base spanning millennia, corporate pop culture prostitutes spew talking points for Big Pharma's mRNA mystery cocktail as the only solution.
[01:22:04.457 --> 01:22:12.039]  And if the solution is less people, which is what the elitists have been saying for decades, then they are succeeding.
[01:22:12.039 --> 01:22:21.821]  Multiple studies conducted in the UK show that after the vaccine was introduced, COVID deaths increased by over a thousand percent.
[01:22:21.821 --> 01:22:28.982]  And more than half of all COVID deaths and hospitalizations are from the fully vaccinated.
[01:22:28.982 --> 01:22:31.403]  The numbers in New York City are showing the same.
[01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:45.458]  Experts in the field, including the inventor of the mRNA tech being used, have been warning of this since the beginning, but silenced by the corporate media.
[01:22:45.458 --> 01:22:55.921]  Project Veritas has recently exposed how doctors and nurses are well aware of the dangerous mRNA jabs, but care more about their own jobs.
[01:22:55.921 --> 01:23:00.402]  And how even low-level big pharma employees care only about the numbers.
[01:23:01.832 --> 01:23:05.813]  It is an all-out attack against the human race.
[01:23:05.813 --> 01:23:12.515]  We knew this a year ago because we know their white papers, which is why we know what comes next.
[01:23:12.515 --> 01:23:24.698]  Brought to you by the same characters behind the mRNA vaccines, what comes next is the end of natural organic humanity and the beginning of man's own version.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:29.282]  Man, fused with machine in a lab.
[01:23:29.282 --> 01:23:30.563]  The end.
[01:23:30.563 --> 01:23:33.245]  There is no more hiding the endgame.
[01:23:33.245 --> 01:23:38.348]  It's out in the open, where only the unbrainwashed can see it.
[01:23:38.348 --> 01:23:41.030]  Ultimately, it will be up to the people.
[01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:45.493]  The police in Australia are loyally serving their globalist masters.
[01:23:45.493 --> 01:23:49.055]  What makes you think anything will be different in America?
[01:23:49.055 --> 01:23:54.899]  A flight surgeon for the US Army has warned that all vaccinated pilots are unfit to fly.
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:56.720]  The U.S.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:59.861]  military is being destroyed from within.
[01:23:59.861 --> 01:24:04.662]  The only way through to freedom is for the people to say no.
[01:24:04.662 --> 01:24:08.763]  Which is now starting to happen all across the world.
[01:24:08.763 --> 01:24:12.444]  Humanity uniting together as the human race.
[01:24:12.444 --> 01:24:18.746]  Standing up against the most sophisticated tyranny that mankind has ever faced.
[01:24:18.746 --> 01:24:21.887]  All while the pop culture media machine ignores it.
[01:24:23.146 --> 01:24:27.810]  A worldwide peaceful revolution of the people is a numbers game.
[01:24:27.810 --> 01:24:32.473]  So continuing to wake people up is our road to liberation.
[01:24:32.473 --> 01:24:38.037]  Do not remain silent during this dire time at the crossroads of human history.
[01:24:38.037 --> 01:24:42.100]  It is the truth that shall set us free.
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.162]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:52.657]  And of course, you can find all of the Reese Reports at Band.Video.
[01:24:52.657 --> 01:25:07.664]  And, you know, this is just part of what you have done to support InfoWars, allowing us to hire new people, hire new reporters, and build the platform of Band.Video so that we can share this information with the world.
[01:25:07.664 --> 01:25:12.166]  Let's finish up here with my stack of COVID news, and we can move on to some of the other developments.
[01:25:12.166 --> 01:25:14.147]  Again, all of the 666
[01:25:16.864 --> 01:25:17.184]  I don't
[01:25:39.946 --> 01:25:46.091]  Currency database, they have patent 666 for the vaccines.
[01:25:46.091 --> 01:25:54.097]  They have, they've written bills with 666 all about the medical tyranny managements and everything.
[01:25:54.097 --> 01:25:55.558]  It's always 666.
[01:25:55.558 --> 01:25:58.701]  And then there's the weird numerology of COVID tying into 666.
[01:25:58.701 --> 01:26:03.645]  So yeah, that's pretty wild stuff, but there it is.
[01:26:05.066 --> 01:26:12.752]  Demonstration against COVID-19 vaccine and testing mandate takes place outside Crystal Lake Elementary District 47 offices.
[01:26:12.752 --> 01:26:14.794]  This is in Illinois.
[01:26:14.794 --> 01:26:22.860]  And they put shoes out because they've now fired people that refused to get the vaccine.
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.182]  Teachers, administrators, coaches.
[01:26:25.182 --> 01:26:32.568]  And so they went to the school and they left just their pairs of shoes in front of the building there.
[01:26:32.568 --> 01:26:33.429]  You can see in this image.
[01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:44.901]  Looks like it's about 50 pairs or so, and it is symbolic of all the people that have been fired because they didn't want to get the experimental injection.
[01:26:44.901 --> 01:26:46.283]  So, there you go.
[01:26:46.283 --> 01:26:48.265]  Oh, but they, oh, we care about the little guy.
[01:26:48.265 --> 01:26:49.867]  Everybody's right to work, right?
[01:26:49.867 --> 01:26:54.632]  Oh, no, but you have to follow our tyrannical mandates first, then you can be free.
[01:26:54.632 --> 01:26:55.934]  See, that's what freedom's really all about.
[01:26:57.563 --> 01:27:03.488]  New York won't extend unemployment benefits to health care workers fired over COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
[01:27:03.488 --> 01:27:06.930]  So, oh, they want to have a welfare state for anybody else that doesn't want to work.
[01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:08.952]  They want to have a welfare state for illegal immigrants.
[01:27:08.952 --> 01:27:10.473]  But, oh, you?
[01:27:10.473 --> 01:27:12.494]  You, fired because you won't take the vaccine?
[01:27:12.494 --> 01:27:14.776]  No, nothing for you.
[01:27:14.776 --> 01:27:25.003]  So Democrats and liberal progressives always pretend to care about you until they realize that you're not going to be in on their brainwash, brainwashing and cult behavior.
[01:27:25.003 --> 01:27:26.505]  Then all of a sudden, they're completely against you.
[01:27:27.298 --> 01:27:28.758]  Pretty simple, really.
[01:27:28.758 --> 01:27:30.379]  Mask up or shut down.
[01:27:30.379 --> 01:27:34.680]  Colorado school give an ultimatum over mask mandate.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.160]  And it's a Christian school.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.361]  They wouldn't do that to any other school but a Christian one.
[01:27:40.361 --> 01:27:46.803]  So a private Christian school in Loveland, Colorado is going to have to file a lawsuit.
[01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:54.564]  Resurrection Christian School is going to have to file a lawsuit because the Democrats want to shut the school down because they don't have a mask mandate.
[01:27:54.564 --> 01:27:55.825]  So much for freedom.
[01:27:55.825 --> 01:27:56.765]  And my body, my choice.
[01:27:58.604 --> 01:28:05.830]  Biotech co-founder says, COVID will become manageable, but the virus will be with us for years.
[01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:06.871]  So, oh, how convenient.
[01:28:06.871 --> 01:28:19.881]  You create a virus in a lab, you release the virus, and then you use the virus to control the people, and you just say, yeah, the virus is here forever, but don't worry, it's going to be manageable as long as you listen to us.
[01:28:19.881 --> 01:28:24.885]  And because Fauci and Daszak haven't been arrested yet for their involvement in this creation of a bioweapon,
[01:28:25.746 --> 01:28:34.452]  They were just seen, Fauci just addressed a Wuhan collaborator conference alongside Peter Daszak.
[01:28:34.452 --> 01:28:36.474]  And the National Pulse has this story.
[01:28:36.474 --> 01:28:40.136]  And so, Fauci and Daszak still on the loose.
[01:28:40.136 --> 01:28:41.497]  They made the virus.
[01:28:41.497 --> 01:28:42.858]  They released the virus.
[01:28:42.858 --> 01:28:47.301]  Now they're the tyrants telling you how to deal with the virus, bringing in medical tyranny worldwide.
[01:28:47.301 --> 01:28:49.843]  And they are still out there.
[01:28:49.843 --> 01:28:51.544]  They need to be criminally investigated.
[01:28:51.544 --> 01:28:54.907]  They need to be called for a congressional hearing immediately.
[01:28:56.624 --> 01:29:00.727]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[01:29:00.727 --> 01:29:06.251]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[01:29:06.251 --> 01:29:07.312]  It hurts.
[01:29:07.312 --> 01:29:08.372]  It stinks.
[01:29:08.372 --> 01:29:09.653]  It's got pus coming out of it.
[01:29:09.653 --> 01:29:10.994]  I go to the doctor, they fix it.
[01:29:10.994 --> 01:29:12.095]  That's not negative.
[01:29:12.095 --> 01:29:12.936]  I'm not living in denial.
[01:29:13.894 --> 01:29:20.097]  And so think of globalism as being hidden, as an infection that we didn't feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[01:29:20.097 --> 01:29:22.117]  That's actually a positive thing.
[01:29:22.117 --> 01:29:24.418]  And so, yeah, Trump did overall a great job.
[01:29:24.418 --> 01:29:25.719]  They stole the election.
[01:29:25.719 --> 01:29:27.500]  We can't get down about that.
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.361]  We have forced them out in the open.
[01:29:31.341 --> 01:29:34.683]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed.
[01:29:34.683 --> 01:29:35.544]  They're scared.
[01:29:35.544 --> 01:29:38.926]  That's why, instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers, look what happened.
[01:29:38.926 --> 01:29:40.226]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[01:29:40.226 --> 01:29:41.527]  They're trying to suppress us.
[01:29:41.527 --> 01:29:45.610]  Let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[01:29:45.610 --> 01:29:49.272]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[01:29:49.272 --> 01:29:53.494]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[01:29:53.494 --> 01:29:56.316]  We're going to win this together and the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:57.557 --> 01:30:06.764]  People ask me, Alex, why did you come out with a new natural organic sleep aid when you already have knockout that works so well with eight natural ingredients?
[01:30:06.764 --> 01:30:13.989]  Well, because when you've taken a certain organic blend for a decade, like I've taken this product I came up with, it doesn't work as well anymore.
[01:30:14.269 --> 01:30:15.570]  That's the way herbs work.
[01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:19.032]  You go off it a while, come back on it, it works again.
[01:30:19.032 --> 01:30:19.692]  So what did I do?
[01:30:19.692 --> 01:30:30.939]  I went to the developers and I said, make a totally different formula with a lot of other known natural healthy compounds that makes you sleep deep and restful, because that's what helps your immune system, and I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout.
[01:30:31.639 --> 01:30:33.460]  Okay, be careful when you take it.
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:34.800]  It's incredibly strong.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.841]  It's named Down-N-Out.
[01:30:35.841 --> 01:30:41.243]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it, but it is extremely strong and we are extremely proud of it.
[01:30:41.243 --> 01:30:45.404]  It is exclusively available at m4warstore.com.

[01:30:47.105 --> 01:30:48.545]  Sold out for more than four months.

[01:30:57.489 --> 01:31:05.951]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:05.951 --> 01:31:16.494]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[01:31:16.494 --> 01:31:26.117]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[01:31:26.477 --> 01:31:32.419]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[01:31:32.419 --> 01:31:37.301]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[01:31:37.301 --> 01:31:41.342]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of
[01:31:41.582 --> 01:31:49.965]  Not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German chamomile, organic skullcap, and valerian roots.
[01:31:49.965 --> 01:31:57.127]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com
[01:31:59.053 --> 01:32:04.461]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[01:32:04.461 --> 01:32:11.792]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:14.616]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[01:32:15.318 --> 01:32:24.711]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[01:32:24.711 --> 01:32:31.880]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[01:32:32.581 --> 01:32:43.007]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[01:32:43.007 --> 01:32:45.768]  You will then be my slaves.
[01:32:45.768 --> 01:32:50.451]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[01:32:50.451 --> 01:32:56.494]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.269]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.087 --> 01:33:29.713]  Alright, let me do a news blitz here in this segment.
[01:33:29.713 --> 01:33:34.255]  Again, Jim Hoft joining me from the Gateway Pundit coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:33:34.255 --> 01:33:38.497]  I've got other videos to get to as well, but I want to just try to pile drive through some of this news.
[01:33:40.842 --> 01:33:42.984]  And I just started with this and I know I've already covered it.
[01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:44.725]  It's just so hilarious.
[01:33:44.725 --> 01:33:52.312]  It just shows, I mean, people are just so stupid that they fall for any of this mainstream media, big pharmaceutical medical tyranny.
[01:33:52.312 --> 01:33:57.196]  Pfizer launches final study for COVID drug that's similar to horse paste.
[01:33:57.196 --> 01:33:58.057]  So you watch.
[01:33:58.057 --> 01:34:02.041]  So Pfizer's Ivermectin will be approved for use.
[01:34:02.041 --> 01:34:04.042]  Pfizer's Ivermectin will be approved for use.
[01:34:04.042 --> 01:34:05.464]  It'll be probably like 30 bucks a thing.
[01:34:06.664 --> 01:34:17.847]  When all the other Ivermectin is like $7, they'll charge you $30, but they'll say, oh, all other Ivermectin is horse to warmer, but Pfizer's Ivermectin, that's approved for use.
[01:34:17.847 --> 01:34:19.507]  Yes.
[01:34:19.507 --> 01:34:24.868]  And you watch all the mainstream media lapdogs and the brainwashed zombies of the planet, they'll just go right along with it.
[01:34:24.868 --> 01:34:28.089]  They'll say, yes, Pfizer Ivermectin, good.
[01:34:28.089 --> 01:34:30.810]  All other Ivermectin, bad.
[01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:34.591]  Pfizer Ivermectin for humans, all other Ivermectin for horses.
[01:34:36.121 --> 01:34:37.903]  Can't wait for that to play itself out.
[01:34:37.903 --> 01:34:40.025]  That will be entertaining.
[01:34:40.025 --> 01:34:41.747]  But yet, also demeaning as a human.
[01:34:41.747 --> 01:34:45.211]  Alright, so this is just hilarious.
[01:34:45.211 --> 01:34:53.380]  So, inside of the federal infrastructure bill, you know, the $3.5 trillion bill that costs $0, so you have to sign it and pass it so that they can spend it.
[01:34:55.305 --> 01:34:57.606]  Yes, this is the Democrat logic.
[01:34:57.606 --> 01:35:00.307]  3.5 trillion equals zero dollars.
[01:35:00.307 --> 01:35:01.167]  War is peace.
[01:35:01.167 --> 01:35:02.867]  Slavery is freedom.
[01:35:02.867 --> 01:35:04.228]  Two plus two equals five.
[01:35:04.228 --> 01:35:06.148]  Yes, this is leftism.
[01:35:06.148 --> 01:35:08.649]  This is leftist ideology now.
[01:35:08.649 --> 01:35:13.971]  But inside the bill is a basically
[01:35:15.339 --> 01:35:21.141]  Carbon footprint tax targeting the individual that drives a car.
[01:35:21.141 --> 01:35:23.022]  It's in there, it's undeniable.
[01:35:23.022 --> 01:35:36.006]  So PolitiFacto, they can't handle the truth that yes, the Democrats have now introduced legislation to basically tax you by the mile or by the month, basically to try to price you out from driving a car.
[01:35:36.006 --> 01:35:40.808]  So unless you have millions of dollars, you're not going to be driving a car anymore.
[01:35:40.808 --> 01:35:42.609]  And see, that was what's so great about the car,
[01:35:44.847 --> 01:35:51.575]  And then even nowadays, was that most people could afford a car, afford to drive a car, and have that luxury and have that freedom.
[01:35:51.575 --> 01:35:52.676]  Well, the globalists hate that.
[01:35:52.676 --> 01:35:53.817]  They only want that for the rich.
[01:35:53.817 --> 01:35:59.984]  They want you, the peasants, to either walk everywhere, bike everywhere, take public transit everywhere, or just sit in a cage all day.
[01:35:59.984 --> 01:36:01.345]  That'd probably be preferable.
[01:36:03.087 --> 01:36:08.111]  Even PolitiFact has to admit that it's real while denying it.
[01:36:08.111 --> 01:36:17.639]  The federal infrastructure bill includes a pilot program for a national motor vehicle per mile user fee, which is basically a long-term plan to make it too expensive to drive a car.
[01:36:17.639 --> 01:36:20.502]  PolitiFact says that's mostly false.
[01:36:20.502 --> 01:36:23.024]  What does mostly false even mean?
[01:36:23.024 --> 01:36:27.708]  Well, to transcribe this, or translate this from PolitiFact, it means it's true!
[01:36:30.114 --> 01:36:30.954]  That's what it means.
[01:36:30.954 --> 01:36:34.196]  It means it's true.
[01:36:34.196 --> 01:36:35.097]  Yes, it's in there.
[01:36:35.097 --> 01:36:35.877]  Yes, it's true.
[01:36:35.877 --> 01:36:39.639]  But we don't want you to know that.
[01:36:39.639 --> 01:36:43.882]  So we just say it's mostly false.
[01:36:43.882 --> 01:36:47.984]  Because most people will be upset if they realize the government is trying to tax them out of driving their car.
[01:36:47.984 --> 01:36:50.865]  And then they'll be even more upset when they realize it's the Democrats trying to do that.
[01:36:50.865 --> 01:36:53.567]  So we just kind of shuffle that under the rug.
[01:36:53.567 --> 01:36:55.648]  And say, nah, it's not really happening.
[01:36:55.648 --> 01:36:57.009]  I mean, it is, but it isn't.
[01:36:58.334 --> 01:36:59.795]  It isn't.
[01:36:59.795 --> 01:37:04.857]  And let's just play that clip real quick, guys, before I move on here.
[01:37:04.857 --> 01:37:06.838]  Just go ahead and play clip 16.
[01:37:06.838 --> 01:37:18.183]  This is the Republicans telling you what's really going on with the $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill, what the Democrats and the liberal media doesn't want you to know.
[01:37:18.183 --> 01:37:19.224]  This is their bill.
[01:37:19.224 --> 01:37:21.165]  2,500 pages.
[01:37:26.132 --> 01:37:42.062]  If you take a look at $3.5 trillion price tag, and you do the math, that's $1,400,000,000 for every page of this bill.
[01:37:42.062 --> 01:37:45.584]  And they want to pass it this week.
[01:37:45.584 --> 01:37:48.066]  How many Democrats do you think have read this?
[01:37:48.066 --> 01:37:50.127]  Think Nancy Pelosi's read it?
[01:37:50.127 --> 01:37:51.168]  Think Chuck Schumer's read it?
[01:37:52.346 --> 01:37:56.809]  Do you think Joe Biden, who is desperately begging Democrats to pass it, do you think he's read it?
[01:37:56.809 --> 01:38:00.091]  Do you think he knows what's in it?
[01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:02.772]  No, I was told it equals $0.
[01:38:02.772 --> 01:38:04.093]  Biden said it's $0.
[01:38:04.093 --> 01:38:05.434]  Psaki said it's $0.
[01:38:05.434 --> 01:38:06.935]  Pelosi said it's $0.
[01:38:06.935 --> 01:38:07.895]  So what are we signing?
[01:38:07.895 --> 01:38:08.456]  What's the big deal?
[01:38:08.456 --> 01:38:10.096]  If it's $0, what are we doing here?
[01:38:10.096 --> 01:38:10.797]  It's not $0.
[01:38:10.797 --> 01:38:12.798]  It's $3.5 trillion.
[01:38:12.798 --> 01:38:14.439]  The Democrats and the media are lying to you.
[01:38:14.439 --> 01:38:15.840]  Because they're liars.
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:19.262]  Let's move on.
[01:38:21.607 --> 01:38:27.290]  Speaking of liars, so another story came out.
[01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:28.831]  It was at a high school in St.
[01:38:28.831 --> 01:38:32.093]  Louis, and maybe I'll talk about this with Jim Hoff coming up.
[01:38:32.093 --> 01:38:34.774]  The Gateway Pundit had this story.
[01:38:34.774 --> 01:38:42.259]  An individual went into the bathroom and spray-painted racial epitaphs in the bathroom.
[01:38:42.259 --> 01:38:42.419]  Okay?
[01:38:43.533 --> 01:38:44.974]  So it became a big thing.
[01:38:44.974 --> 01:38:46.355]  All the politicians in St.
[01:38:46.355 --> 01:38:55.781]  Louis came out to that school, and they had multiple walkouts and rallies, and politicians and media used it to make a statement saying, see how racist America is, all this stuff.
[01:38:55.781 --> 01:39:03.105]  Well, after all the hubbubalub and everything, and the walkouts and the protests, and then, oh, guess what?
[01:39:03.105 --> 01:39:07.948]  They came to find out it was a black student that did it.
[01:39:07.948 --> 01:39:09.749]  It was a leftist liberal that did it.
[01:39:09.749 --> 01:39:10.550]  Faked racism.
[01:39:11.766 --> 01:39:17.030]  Because, you know, the Democrats are so desperate for racism to be everywhere that they have to fake it.
[01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.731]  They have to do it.
[01:39:17.731 --> 01:39:18.972]  So they're the racists.
[01:39:18.972 --> 01:39:20.453]  They commit the hate crimes.
[01:39:20.453 --> 01:39:26.638]  They fake the hate crimes like spraying racial images and words on the bathrooms.
[01:39:26.638 --> 01:39:28.519]  By the way, they've been caught doing this dozens of times now.
[01:39:28.519 --> 01:39:29.660]  It's every damn time.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:31.722]  It's Jussie Smollett 2.0.
[01:39:31.722 --> 01:39:34.344]  Just copycat Jussie Smollett.
[01:39:34.344 --> 01:39:38.507]  So the Democrats are so desperate, liberals are so desperate for America to be racist, they have to hate it.
[01:39:40.356 --> 01:39:53.810]  When I see these two stories, I immediately am drawn to, this is another fake one, vile Nazi graffiti appears at primary schools as vandals paint red swastika on the wall.
[01:39:53.810 --> 01:39:57.774]  If they ever find out who did this, they'll find out it was a liberal leftist.
[01:39:57.774 --> 01:39:59.516]  Guarantee it.
[01:39:59.516 --> 01:40:02.059]  Guarantee it.
[01:40:02.059 --> 01:40:02.880]  And then here's another one.
[01:40:05.706 --> 01:40:13.768]  Security camera captures Vandal tossing an incendiary device into Democrat Party offices in Austin.
[01:40:13.768 --> 01:40:17.349]  And this occurred this morning at about 2 a.m.
[01:40:17.349 --> 01:40:23.991]  Now guys, if you could please pull up this story because I don't have the image on my document here, but pull it up because I want you to see the image.
[01:40:27.232 --> 01:40:34.275]  I'm going to go ahead, I hope they do a full investigation into this, and I hope that they find out the perpetrator of this.
[01:40:34.275 --> 01:40:37.836]  See, it used to be maybe going out on a limb to say something like this.
[01:40:37.836 --> 01:40:41.138]  Now, it's a very sturdy limb, if it's even considered a limb.
[01:40:41.138 --> 01:40:44.739]  It's basically a tree trunk of confidence at this point.
[01:40:44.739 --> 01:40:48.780]  If and when they find out this individual, I guarantee you he ends up being a Democrat.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:51.542]  He may even work at the very facility.
[01:40:51.542 --> 01:40:52.502]  Because, here's the thing.
[01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:56.851]  The guy shows up.
[01:40:56.851 --> 01:41:01.815]  They obviously know there's a security camera at their facility.
[01:41:01.815 --> 01:41:15.284]  So the guy shows up with an American flag bandana and an American flag mask and throws a Molotov cocktail into the Democrat Party headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[01:41:15.284 --> 01:41:17.546]  Now, do you really think
[01:41:18.984 --> 01:41:25.310]  A genuine vandal, which by the way, you don't have any history of Republicans committing violent crimes like this, political crimes like this.
[01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:26.971]  It just, it doesn't exist.
[01:41:26.971 --> 01:41:31.255]  That's why they had to fake the ones that they do.
[01:41:31.255 --> 01:41:43.225]  But can you imagine somebody's like, oh, I'm going to show up in an American flag face mask and bandana right in front of a security camera and throw one Molotov cocktail into the Democrat Party offices.
[01:41:43.225 --> 01:41:44.526]  That'll show them, that'll teach them.
[01:41:46.204 --> 01:41:55.448]  Or could you imagine a Democrat saying, I need to fake a hate crime against us, to make us look like we're victims, and to show how bad Republicans are.
[01:41:55.448 --> 01:42:06.292]  And I know we've got a camera in front of our offices, so I'm going to show up late this night, and I'm going to have an American flag mask and bandana on, so that they think it's a Republican.
[01:42:06.292 --> 01:42:12.595]  Because, you know, we hate the American flag, and they like America, so I'll wear American flag apparel, that way they'll think I'm a Republican.
[01:42:13.336 --> 01:42:20.788]  And it'll all be on camera, too, because I know we have a security camera right in front of our office.
[01:42:20.788 --> 01:42:23.632]  So, I hope if and when they find this individual...
[01:42:25.029 --> 01:42:30.652]  We get the full story here and I would bet you it's a liberal Democrat that did it.
[01:42:30.652 --> 01:42:37.256]  A hate crime against themselves for the media coverage and to pose as victims because that's what they do best.
[01:42:37.256 --> 01:42:45.080]  They've been caught doing it dozens of times from Jussie Smollett to colleges to high schools to Democrat Party offices.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.301]  It's always the Democrats.
[01:42:46.301 --> 01:42:47.201]  It's always the left.
[01:42:47.201 --> 01:42:48.482]  They do this to themselves.
[01:42:48.482 --> 01:42:49.903]  So I hope they find this individual
[01:42:50.763 --> 01:42:57.849]  Hope they find him, and we'll see what the real story here is, but I think we all know, don't we?
[01:42:57.849 --> 01:43:04.995]  I have the greatest sense of loss, deep in my heart, deep in my soul, I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet.
[01:43:04.995 --> 01:43:06.796]  I've had a lot of loss.
[01:43:06.796 --> 01:43:08.618]  Everybody else has.
[01:43:08.618 --> 01:43:19.927]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:25.232]  And now, we're just throwing it all away.
[01:43:25.232 --> 01:43:32.555]  And I see the general public in a medically-induced, scientifically-induced, behavioral, psychologically-controlled trance.
[01:43:32.555 --> 01:43:38.318]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder, and it's so incredibly sad.
[01:43:38.318 --> 01:43:48.023]  But, this is the process of birth, and then growth, and then falling apart, and then degenerating and collapsing, and then coming back to life again.
[01:43:49.163 --> 01:43:56.805]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[01:43:56.805 --> 01:43:58.445]  I got some good news.
[01:43:58.445 --> 01:44:04.666]  All the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50% off at Infowarshore.com.
[01:44:04.666 --> 01:44:07.987]  The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out.
[01:44:07.987 --> 01:44:11.647]  So this sale is only going from one week starting on September 29th.
[01:44:11.647 --> 01:44:13.668]  And in the case of green fiber capsules,
[01:44:14.568 --> 01:44:16.929]  These will be sold out in just a couple days.
[01:44:16.929 --> 01:44:18.090]  50% off.
[01:44:18.090 --> 01:44:19.271]  We have Knockout Sleep Aid.
[01:44:19.271 --> 01:44:20.351]  50% off.
[01:44:20.351 --> 01:44:21.572]  Sold out for months.
[01:44:21.572 --> 01:44:22.513]  Very popular.
[01:44:22.513 --> 01:44:24.114]  Twice as strong as Knockout.
[01:44:24.114 --> 01:44:25.575]  Probably too strong for some people.
[01:44:25.575 --> 01:44:27.015]  Totally different formula.
[01:44:27.015 --> 01:44:28.236]  Down and Out is back in stock.
[01:44:28.236 --> 01:44:29.297]  50% off.
[01:44:29.297 --> 01:44:32.679]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12.
[01:44:32.679 --> 01:44:33.279]  50% off.
[01:44:33.279 --> 01:44:35.600]  And also on Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.241]  Survival still X2.
[01:44:36.801 --> 01:44:40.283]  It's all 40% to 50% off for one week only.
[01:44:40.283 --> 01:44:42.084]  Take advantage of it and fund the InfoWar.
[01:44:42.084 --> 01:44:43.525]  And I thank you all for your support.
[01:44:43.525 --> 01:44:48.487]  InfoWarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:44:48.487 --> 01:44:49.788]  It's a win-win.
[01:44:49.788 --> 01:44:54.010]  These are things that make you healthy, make your life better, and they fund the InfoWar.
[01:44:54.010 --> 01:44:56.532]  Again, the only way we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[01:44:57.955 --> 01:45:02.817]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[01:45:02.817 --> 01:45:04.878]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[01:45:04.878 --> 01:45:10.360]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:11.460]  But we failed.
[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:13.101]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[01:45:13.101 --> 01:45:14.981]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[01:45:14.981 --> 01:45:16.682]  But they are going ahead.
[01:45:17.042 --> 01:45:20.984]  With their full operational deindustrialization, Great Reset.
[01:45:20.984 --> 01:45:29.908]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[01:45:29.908 --> 01:45:35.111]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[01:45:35.111 --> 01:45:38.012]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[01:45:38.012 --> 01:45:42.774]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarestore.com.
[01:45:42.774 --> 01:45:46.296]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets,
[01:45:46.576 --> 01:45:48.337]  It's ready to ship right now.
[01:45:48.337 --> 01:45:53.221]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[01:45:53.221 --> 01:45:55.563]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[01:45:55.563 --> 01:45:58.084]  Get ready at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:58.084 --> 01:46:06.711]  So the placebo that they have used, that the FDA has allowed them to use, has often been another vaccine.
[01:46:06.711 --> 01:46:12.535]  A vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing death and damage in its own right.
[01:46:12.535 --> 01:46:13.255]  That it's the
[01:46:14.304 --> 01:46:24.788]  Aluminum, as an adjuvant in the vaccine, a known neurotoxin, a known immunotoxin, a known poison in human beings, that is in the supposedly inert placebo.
[01:46:24.788 --> 01:46:26.269]  Totally inappropriate.
[01:46:26.269 --> 01:46:28.150]  This is not good science.
[01:46:28.150 --> 01:46:30.651]  It is not science at all.
[01:46:30.651 --> 01:46:42.655]  It is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and onto the market.
[01:46:42.655 --> 01:46:43.796]  That is the only concern.
[01:46:44.127 --> 01:46:48.772]  Dr. Wakefield is just one of many informed voices in the film, Covenant Land.
[01:46:48.772 --> 01:46:52.016]  Secure your copy of Covenant Land today at covenantland.com.
[01:46:52.016 --> 01:47:00.066]  And if you order by October 6, you get a free copy of the film, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, absolutely free.
[01:47:00.066 --> 01:47:02.689]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.519 --> 01:47:23.001]  Back here on the Alex Jones Show, Owen Schroer sitting in for Alex.
[01:47:23.001 --> 01:47:25.542]  He's busy on the road right now, but he's going to be back.
[01:47:25.542 --> 01:47:34.125]  He may even guest host the War Room today or be popping in on the War Room as I'm filling in duties here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:40.673]  But we do have Jim Hoft coming up from the Gateway Pundit with some breaking news.
[01:47:40.673 --> 01:47:41.573]  He'll be joining us shortly.
[01:47:41.573 --> 01:47:48.538]  Let me just delve back into the other news that I have here on my desk, see if we can't clear it out before Jim joins me.
[01:47:48.538 --> 01:47:57.565]  YouTube's CEO says free speech is a core value.
[01:47:57.565 --> 01:48:03.229]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, free speech is a core value of YouTube and my head is bald.
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:06.241]  I have a bald head.
[01:48:06.241 --> 01:48:13.966]  The studio lights are gleaming off of my bald head right now.
[01:48:13.966 --> 01:48:18.109]  And YouTube has free speech as a core value.
[01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:19.610]  Right.
[01:48:19.610 --> 01:48:23.053]  Russia threatens to block YouTube for deleting RT channels.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:25.902]  Whoa, whoa, I thought YouTube believed in free speech.
[01:48:25.902 --> 01:48:26.602]  Oh, no, they don't.
[01:48:26.602 --> 01:48:27.723]  They're censoring free speech.
[01:48:27.723 --> 01:48:28.183]  That's right.
[01:48:28.183 --> 01:48:34.928]  They believe in global government tyranny, which means censoring free speech if you're against the global government.
[01:48:34.928 --> 01:48:38.070]  So YouTube just can't stop lying.
[01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:40.251]  I forget the name of the author of this story.
[01:48:40.251 --> 01:48:41.973]  I don't know why it didn't print out.
[01:48:41.973 --> 01:48:43.634]  It's at brownstone.org.
[01:48:43.634 --> 01:48:44.835]  The purges have begun.
[01:48:45.967 --> 01:48:51.011]  And this is really just kind of a logical centrist who said that this is the most important work he's ever done.
[01:48:51.011 --> 01:48:52.151]  He's been around for a long time.
[01:48:52.151 --> 01:48:53.192]  Again, I forget the name of the author.
[01:48:53.192 --> 01:48:59.617]  But it gets into how the political persecutions have begun at all levels of our society.
[01:48:59.617 --> 01:49:02.198]  Government, schools, the military, everything.
[01:49:02.198 --> 01:49:04.500]  And how dangerous it is and where it leads.
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:08.142]  So most people are starting to figure this out now.
[01:49:08.142 --> 01:49:12.345]  But it's time to be honest about who's doing it so that we can stop it.
[01:49:12.345 --> 01:49:13.346]  It's the left doing it.
[01:49:13.346 --> 01:49:14.427]  It's the Democrats doing it.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:22.442]  It's liberal progressive Democrats on the left that are purging opposition to them.
[01:49:22.442 --> 01:49:24.063]  They're the tyrants.
[01:49:24.063 --> 01:49:26.423]  They're the Nazis.
[01:49:26.423 --> 01:49:39.668]  And so, even though in the story it gets into that, it doesn't put the onus on the actual political parties responsible for it, because people don't want to leap that shark yet.
[01:49:39.668 --> 01:49:43.389]  Well, until you face the reality of who's doing this to us, you're not going to defeat it.
[01:49:44.721 --> 01:49:47.062]  This is what he's talking about, by the way.
[01:49:47.062 --> 01:49:53.005]  Professor removed after refusal to grade black students on a curve sues UCLA.
[01:49:53.005 --> 01:50:11.113]  So what they wanted to do at UCLA, or what they do actually, and what they're doing at schools across America, if a black student gets a C, that's a B. If a white student gets a C, that's a C. If a black student gets a C, that's a B or even an A. And so the UCLA professor says, I'm not doing this, this is discrimination.
[01:50:11.937 --> 01:50:14.419]  I'm not grading people on a racial curve.
[01:50:14.419 --> 01:50:17.442]  So UCLA fired him.
[01:50:17.442 --> 01:50:21.125]  How dare you not be racist, says UCLA.
[01:50:21.125 --> 01:50:25.789]  Here's more of the great purge that the left is currently involved in.
[01:50:25.789 --> 01:50:32.214]  Marine who saved baby from Kabul airport under investigation after appearing at Trump rally.
[01:50:32.214 --> 01:50:36.197]  Oh, you showed up at a Trump rally?
[01:50:36.197 --> 01:50:39.180]  We're going to investigate you because you don't have free speech.
[01:50:41.644 --> 01:50:45.027]  Exclusive, Daily Caller.
[01:50:45.027 --> 01:50:53.234]  Jailed Marine who demanded accountability for Afghanistan offered to resign honorably but rejected so they could throw him in jail.
[01:50:53.234 --> 01:50:58.599]  And so Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Scheller sits in jail right now, another political prisoner of the Democrat Party.
[01:50:58.599 --> 01:50:58.899]  Why?
[01:50:58.899 --> 01:51:03.783]  Because he called out the Biden administration's failings and lies about Afghanistan.
[01:51:03.783 --> 01:51:06.846]  So, oh, this member of the military spoke at a Trump rally.
[01:51:06.846 --> 01:51:07.786]  We're going to investigate you.
[01:51:08.667 --> 01:51:15.949]  Oh, this member of the military spoke out against crimes he saw committed and lies committed by the military and by our White House leadership.
[01:51:15.949 --> 01:51:17.470]  We're going to throw you in a jail.
[01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:19.631]  But I'll resign with a dishonorable discharge.
[01:51:19.631 --> 01:51:21.451]  No, we're going to keep you there.
[01:51:21.451 --> 01:51:22.792]  And you know what?
[01:51:22.792 --> 01:51:24.292]  We're going to just go and throw you in jail.
[01:51:24.292 --> 01:51:25.473]  Because that's what we do.
[01:51:25.473 --> 01:51:26.153]  We're the Democrats.
[01:51:26.153 --> 01:51:27.313]  We have political parties.
[01:51:27.313 --> 01:51:30.134]  And by the way, political prisoners, excuse me.
[01:51:30.134 --> 01:51:32.075]  And by the way, I'm going to tell you what they're about to do next.
[01:51:34.099 --> 01:51:37.420]  I don't know what the deal is with the Taliban and Joe Biden.
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:44.482]  I don't know if they have blackmail on Biden or blackmail on Obama, or why the Taliban is basically running the White House foreign policy in Afghanistan.
[01:51:44.482 --> 01:51:45.702]  I mean, literally it treats that point.
[01:51:45.702 --> 01:51:58.285]  And so, what you're going to see happen next, remember, I guess it was Tuesday, a private contractor rescued dozens of Americans
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.802]  And overall, more than 100 people, but dozens of Americans and dozens of green card holders that were trapped in Afghanistan.
[01:52:05.802 --> 01:52:07.263]  Yeah, the Biden administration lied.
[01:52:07.263 --> 01:52:09.243]  There were still Americans over there trapped.
[01:52:09.243 --> 01:52:11.384]  There were still allies of ours over there trapped.
[01:52:11.384 --> 01:52:13.025]  Biden administration lied about that.
[01:52:13.025 --> 01:52:19.607]  So a private contractor flew a plane over there, rescued them, and tried to get entry back into the U.S.
[01:52:19.607 --> 01:52:21.068]  and was denied entry.
[01:52:22.108 --> 01:52:27.089]  No, I guess they should have landed at the southern border and crossed the Rio Grande, and then they could have been let in and had free handouts.
[01:52:27.089 --> 01:52:31.350]  But if you try to fly in legitimately as an American, you're not allowed to do that, see?
[01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:33.250]  So here's what's going to come next.
[01:52:33.250 --> 01:52:38.551]  And you're going to start hearing about this before the weekend, and then probably next week it may be actual policy.
[01:52:38.551 --> 01:52:43.952]  The Taliban runs the Biden administration's Afghanistan policy.
[01:52:43.952 --> 01:52:48.613]  And they're going to start treating anybody who's either trying to rescue Americans over there
[01:52:50.262 --> 01:52:56.304]  Or trying to send money to Americans over there because they may need help or food or who knows what.
[01:52:56.304 --> 01:53:05.387]  And if you do that, it's going to be considered a crime, I bet you, by the end of October.
[01:53:05.387 --> 01:53:09.469]  So, again, you're going to see this coming and you're not going to believe it.
[01:53:10.427 --> 01:53:22.390]  And it's not going to make any sense, and I don't know, it doesn't make any sense to me, unless the Taliban, I don't know how the Taliban have so much leverage over Joe Biden, but they're running the entire U.S.
[01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:23.811]  foreign policy in Afghanistan.
[01:53:23.811 --> 01:53:25.951]  They're running the Biden White House now.
[01:53:25.951 --> 01:53:34.994]  And they don't like Americans rescuing Americans and Afghanistan green card holders from Afghanistan, so they told Biden not to let them in.
[01:53:34.994 --> 01:53:35.514]  So they didn't.
[01:53:36.727 --> 01:53:43.868]  And next it's going to be, oh, we're seeing people sending money to loved ones in Afghanistan or churches in Afghanistan.
[01:53:43.868 --> 01:53:46.209]  We want that to be treated like a crime.
[01:53:46.209 --> 01:53:47.089]  And you watch.
[01:53:47.089 --> 01:53:51.090]  The Biden administration will give the Taliban that next.
[01:53:51.090 --> 01:53:51.890]  Wow.
[01:53:51.890 --> 01:54:01.272]  So the Biden administration gave the Taliban an entire military arsenal, hundreds of millions of dollars, an entire country.
[01:54:01.272 --> 01:54:02.352]  What else am I missing?
[01:54:02.352 --> 01:54:04.693]  Oh, hostages.
[01:54:04.693 --> 01:54:05.433]  Hostages, too.
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:14.970]  Just unbelievable stuff.
[01:54:14.970 --> 01:54:15.852]  Unbelievable stuff.
[01:54:15.852 --> 01:54:17.514]  So the Taliban runs the Biden White House.
[01:54:18.735 --> 01:54:20.877]  So we know that Russia has blackmail on the Bidens.
[01:54:20.877 --> 01:54:22.719]  We know that China has blackmail on the Bidens.
[01:54:22.719 --> 01:54:25.121]  We know Uzbekistan has blackmail on the Bidens.
[01:54:25.121 --> 01:54:26.643]  Does the Taliban too?
[01:54:26.643 --> 01:54:28.024]  Or are they blackmailing Obama?
[01:54:28.024 --> 01:54:29.505]  Or how is all of this going on?
[01:54:29.505 --> 01:54:31.207]  But you watch.
[01:54:31.207 --> 01:54:37.092]  I would guess that in the month of October, they come out with new mandates.
[01:54:37.092 --> 01:54:41.497]  No American is allowed to try to rescue Americans from Afghanistan.
[01:54:41.497 --> 01:54:43.779]  And no American is allowed to send money to Afghanistan.
[01:54:46.909 --> 01:54:49.170]  Yes, see, the Taliban warns Joe Biden.
[01:54:49.170 --> 01:54:51.631]  They are running the show, folks.
[01:54:51.631 --> 01:54:54.412]  They are running the show.
[01:54:54.412 --> 01:54:55.173]  Why?
[01:54:55.173 --> 01:54:56.754]  Your guess is as good as mine.
[01:54:56.754 --> 01:54:59.815]  I've laid out what I think may be going on.
[01:54:59.815 --> 01:55:01.996]  Moving on.
[01:55:01.996 --> 01:55:12.341]  Governor Abbott announced his intention to appeal FEMA denial of federal emergency declaration in response to border crisis, and they just released, this is a press release that just came out yesterday,
[01:55:13.379 --> 01:55:26.682]  So basically, Greg Abbott declared a federal emergency because of the illegal immigrant invasion at the southern border in Texas, and he wanted help from FEMA, and FEMA said, nope, we reject that.
[01:55:26.682 --> 01:55:34.404]  And now they're trying to deny all federal emergency money from Texas because of Governor Abbott, and he's fighting back against it.
[01:55:34.404 --> 01:55:39.105]  So the Democrats create an emergency at the southern border, you try to do something about it, and then they make it illegal.
[01:55:40.694 --> 01:55:47.557]  The Democrats create an emergency in Afghanistan, you try to do something about it, and then they make it illegal.
[01:55:47.557 --> 01:55:50.758]  And the war on the Border Patrol continues out of the White House.
[01:55:50.758 --> 01:55:56.260]  Border Patrol agents must be vaccinated by November or face being fired.
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:00.742]  So, tack it to the list of the things that Joe Biden has declared war on.
[01:56:00.742 --> 01:56:05.144]  Teachers, the military, Border Patrol, police officers, pretty much every U.S.
[01:56:05.144 --> 01:56:05.524]  citizen.
[01:56:06.618 --> 01:56:09.098]  And I guess innocent women at baseball games, too.
[01:56:09.098 --> 01:56:16.580]  Joe Biden creeps on unsuspecting woman at congressional baseball game and then boxes her in.
[01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:18.520]  And then boxes her in.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:21.921]  Seriously, this guy is such a creep.
[01:56:21.921 --> 01:56:24.741]  This guy is just such a creep.
[01:56:24.741 --> 01:56:25.181]  Unbelievable.
[01:56:25.181 --> 01:56:27.382]  Alright, so this is a funny one.
[01:56:27.382 --> 01:56:32.463]  Kamala Harris hires crisis experts to repair her long-term planning outlook.
[01:56:32.463 --> 01:56:33.983]  So here's what's happening, folks.
[01:56:35.285 --> 01:56:39.368]  Kamala Harris hired a team of crisis experts.
[01:56:39.368 --> 01:56:49.056]  Basically, CEOs and other people hire these firms to fix their public image when they have a bad public image or they have some story come out that's bad.
[01:56:49.056 --> 01:56:51.839]  They hire these firms to fix their public image.
[01:56:51.839 --> 01:56:54.461]  Kamala Harris has hired these firms.
[01:56:54.461 --> 01:56:58.924]  So she knows she's completely disliked by the American people.
[01:56:58.924 --> 01:57:00.586]  Everybody knows she's a phony.
[01:57:00.586 --> 01:57:01.827]  She has almost no support.
[01:57:01.827 --> 01:57:02.888]  She's nowhere to be found.
[01:57:04.557 --> 01:57:08.999]  And so she's hired crisis experts to repair her public image now.
[01:57:08.999 --> 01:57:15.783]  Now, I don't know if this is a sign that maybe she's getting ready to take over the White House or something else, but it is a sign that she knows she's unpopular.
[01:57:15.783 --> 01:57:17.063]  She knows she's disliked.
[01:57:17.063 --> 01:57:18.464]  Everybody knows she's a phony.
[01:57:18.464 --> 01:57:21.545]  So now she's going to try to fake being somebody else.
[01:57:21.545 --> 01:57:22.846]  Don't you love it?
[01:57:22.846 --> 01:57:25.467]  So we don't like her because she's a complete phony.
[01:57:25.467 --> 01:57:30.230]  So now she hires a team of experts to teach her how to be something else phony.
[01:57:31.190 --> 01:57:33.192]  Hey Kamala, here's a wild idea.
[01:57:33.192 --> 01:57:35.594]  Why don't you just be yourself?
[01:57:35.594 --> 01:57:41.220]  Or maybe that already took its toll when you were working for Willie Brown to get involved in politics.
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:42.361]  I guess maybe that's yourself.
[01:57:42.361 --> 01:57:47.145]  So now she has to fake being somebody else to repair her public image.
[01:57:47.145 --> 01:57:50.869]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[01:57:52.093 --> 01:57:56.296]  Well, we look at the world system now openly announcing the Mark of the Beast.
[01:57:56.296 --> 01:58:12.467]  Everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics, our very future over to them.
[01:58:12.467 --> 01:58:14.208]  They want control of procreation.
[01:58:14.208 --> 01:58:17.170]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[01:58:17.170 --> 01:58:21.713]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[01:58:22.894 --> 01:58:28.458]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will.
[01:58:28.458 --> 01:58:39.008]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[01:58:39.008 --> 01:58:44.993]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[01:58:47.318 --> 01:58:49.959]  My business model is very, very simple.
[01:58:49.959 --> 01:59:07.304]  I want to bring you products that work really, really well at affordable prices that are competitive so that you'll shop with us and so we form a relationship so we're able to stay on air and fight the globalists and have good products that make us healthy, make us wiser, that boost our immune system.
[01:59:07.304 --> 01:59:08.064]  And that's what we've done.
[01:59:08.464 --> 01:59:12.527]  Now one area of the immune system we don't talk enough about is deep restful sleep.
[01:59:12.527 --> 01:59:13.808]  Look it up for yourself.
[01:59:13.808 --> 01:59:16.910]  The effects of deep restful sleep on health and the immune system.
[01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:22.174]  And so with everything we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D and zinc and all of it, that's great.
[01:59:22.174 --> 01:59:25.377]  But deep restful sleep is just as important, maybe more important,
[01:59:25.817 --> 01:59:34.380]  So, InfoWarsTore.com now can announce 50% off on our best-selling product, Down and Out, that just came back in after four months being sold out.

[01:59:37.622 --> 01:59:40.403]  If you want deep, restful sleep, this will do it.
[01:59:40.403 --> 01:59:41.403]  Everybody loves it.
[01:59:41.403 --> 01:59:42.604]  Five stars.
[01:59:42.604 --> 01:59:50.947]  InfoWarsTore.com, Down and Out, now back in stock, 50% off.
[01:59:50.947 --> 01:59:53.608]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.704 --> 02:00:04.049]  We're about to be joined by Jim Hoffman, the Gateway Pundit.
[02:00:04.049 --> 02:00:11.343]  But first, Matt Gaetz decimates Millian Austin yesterday in front of Congress.
[02:00:11.343 --> 02:00:12.906]  You really blew that call, didn't you, General?
[02:00:16.269 --> 02:00:27.475]  I believe that that was a issue of strategic stalemate, and that if we had remained in Afghanistan with the advisory levels of effort, then the government of Afghanistan... Well, that's an interesting answer to a question.
[02:00:27.475 --> 02:00:28.836]  It's just not one I asked.
[02:00:28.836 --> 02:00:40.102]  You spent more time with Bob Woodward on this book than you spent analyzing the very likely prospect that the Afghanistan government was going to fall immediately to the Taliban, didn't you?
[02:00:40.102 --> 02:00:41.123]  Not even close, Congressman.
[02:00:41.283 --> 02:00:41.804]  I'm not aware of...
[02:00:59.275 --> 02:01:07.718]  You're not aware of the phone call that Biden had with Ghani where he said, whether it is true or not, we want you to go out there and paint a rosy picture of what's going on in Afghanistan.
[02:01:07.718 --> 02:01:09.979]  You're the chief military advisor to the president.
[02:01:09.979 --> 02:01:17.402]  You said that the Taliban was not going to defeat the government of Afghanistan militarily, which by the way, they cut through them like a hot knife through butter.
[02:01:17.402 --> 02:01:19.863]  And then the president tries to get Ghani to lie.
[02:01:19.863 --> 02:01:21.224]  When did you become aware of that attempt?
[02:01:21.224 --> 02:01:23.465]  Well, there's two things there, Congressman, if I may.
[02:01:25.188 --> 02:01:34.132]  Is what I said was the situation was stalemate, and if we kept advisors with there, the government of Afghanistan and the army would have still been there.
[02:01:34.132 --> 02:01:35.192]  That's what I said.
[02:01:35.192 --> 02:01:40.174]  Whether that's right or wrong, I don't know, but... Seems wrong now with the Taliban... Well, we withdrew all the... The question for Secretary Austin.
[02:01:40.174 --> 02:01:46.057]  Secretary Austin, are you capable of assessing whether another has the will to fight?
[02:01:50.396 --> 02:01:51.277]  No, we're not.
[02:01:51.277 --> 02:01:54.179]  And that's the point that the chairman made earlier.
[02:01:54.179 --> 02:02:01.886]  That's just like an incredibly disappointing thing for the Secretary of Defense to simply say, I can't assess whether someone has the will to fight.
[02:02:01.886 --> 02:02:03.667]  But it is consistent with your record.
[02:02:03.667 --> 02:02:11.034]  I mean, during the Obama administration, I think they gave you about $48 million to go train up some folks in Syria to go take on the Assad government.
[02:02:11.034 --> 02:02:16.118]  And I think your testimony was that only four or five survived first contact with the enemy.
[02:02:16.118 --> 02:02:18.500]  So what confidence should this committee have in you or
[02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:35.135]  Should the country have in you when you've now confessed to us and whether it's the swing and a miss in Afghanistan that General Milley talked to the Senate about yesterday, total failure, or whether it was your failures in Syria, you don't seem capable to look at a fighting force and determine whether or not they have the will.
[02:02:35.795 --> 02:02:48.813]  You recall, Congressman, that the end result was the SDF that we stood up that was very, very instrumental in turning the tide of battle up in Syria.
[02:02:49.329 --> 02:02:55.511]  Oh yeah, turned it so much, you've got Assad in power in Syria, you've got the Taliban in power in Afghanistan.
[02:02:55.511 --> 02:02:56.832]  I mean, where have you been?
[02:02:56.832 --> 02:03:01.594]  The focus was ISIS, Congressman.
[02:03:01.594 --> 02:03:06.716]  And those forces had significant effect on the ISIS network.
[02:03:06.716 --> 02:03:09.217]  It just seems like you're chronically bad at this.
[02:03:09.217 --> 02:03:11.498]  And you have admitted that, I guess, which is...
[02:03:12.406 --> 02:03:13.587]  To your credit.
[02:03:13.587 --> 02:03:30.562]  But, you know, when people in the military, like Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Scheller, stand up and demand accountability, when they say that you all screwed up, when they point out that General Milley's statement that the government of Afghanistan is not going to get defeated by the Taliban, well, he ends up in the brig.
[02:03:31.323 --> 02:03:43.088]  And you all end up in front of us, and your former employer Raytheon ends up with a lot of money, and we have poured cash and blood and credibility into a Ghani government that was a mirage.
[02:03:43.088 --> 02:03:44.309]  It fell immediately.
[02:03:44.309 --> 02:03:50.772]  And while the guy sitting next to you was off, you know, talking to Phil Rucker, and was off doing his thing with Bob Woodward,
[02:03:52.145 --> 02:03:54.107]  We were buying into the big lie.
[02:03:54.107 --> 02:04:02.113]  The big lie that this was ever going to be successful and that we could ever rely on the Afghanistan government for anything at all.
[02:04:02.113 --> 02:04:08.699]  General Milley, you kind of gave up the game earlier when you said you wanted to address elements of your personal conduct that were in question.
[02:04:08.699 --> 02:04:11.161]  We're not questioning your personal conduct.
[02:04:11.161 --> 02:04:11.961]  We're questioning
[02:04:12.802 --> 02:04:18.687]  In your official capacity, going and undermining the chain of command, which is obviously what you did.
[02:04:18.687 --> 02:04:20.949]  You've created this whole chain of communication narrative.
[02:04:20.949 --> 02:04:23.631]  I did not undermine the chain of command in any manner.
[02:04:23.631 --> 02:04:24.612]  I did not.
[02:04:24.612 --> 02:04:27.234]  Well, you know what?
[02:04:27.234 --> 02:04:32.658]  You said yesterday that you weren't going to resign when Senators asked you this question.
[02:04:32.658 --> 02:04:34.760]  And I believe that you guys probably won't resign.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:38.323]  You seem to be very happy failing up over there.
[02:04:39.502 --> 02:04:42.081]  But if we didn't have a president that was so addled...
[02:04:42.970 --> 02:04:45.791]  You all would be fired, because that is what you deserve.
[02:04:45.791 --> 02:04:57.393]  You have let down the people who wear the uniform in my district and all around this country, and you're far more interested in what your perception is and how people think about you in insider Washington books.
[02:04:57.393 --> 02:05:08.995]  So if you understand that this is not FDA approved, it's totally experimental, it's never been given to human beings before, some of the ingredients inside of these
[02:05:09.875 --> 02:05:10.136]  I think?
[02:05:28.177 --> 02:05:34.799]  Whether it's going to cause infertility, whether it's going to cause cancer, how bad your autoimmune disease is going to be.
[02:05:34.799 --> 02:05:48.383]  My conclusion after looking at this for a long time and listening to the arguments for these masks, I've determined that if you believe, if you're a medical doctor or a scientist that is spouting, using these masks, you're either being played or you're being paid.

[02:06:05.891 --> 02:06:09.113]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:06:09.113 --> 02:06:16.558]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:06:16.558 --> 02:06:19.761]  That's why I said that, yeah.
[02:06:19.761 --> 02:06:22.723]  We got it, we got it.
[02:06:22.723 --> 02:06:23.824]  Thank you all very much.
[02:06:23.824 --> 02:06:26.686]  It's going to be a baffled day, perhaps I'll see you along the way.
[02:06:26.686 --> 02:06:26.946]  Hi!
[02:06:28.337 --> 02:06:30.623]  I'll see you along the way.
[02:06:30.623 --> 02:06:32.327]  Think positively, okay?
[02:06:39.176 --> 02:06:46.138]  Okay, there's Nancy Pelosi seeming to be drunk off of her behind at about 9 a.m.
[02:06:46.138 --> 02:06:48.119]  this morning.
[02:06:48.119 --> 02:06:50.519]  She's in a real good spot there.
[02:06:50.519 --> 02:06:58.802]  And so there's her, there's Nancy Pelosi, and then there's Jim Hoff joining me now from the Gateway Pundit.
[02:06:58.802 --> 02:07:01.683]  Always a pleasure to be joined by our friends over there at the Gateway Pundit.
[02:07:01.683 --> 02:07:08.205]  We got a lot to get into there, but an interesting, you know, 14 or so hours for Nancy Pelosi.
[02:07:09.165 --> 02:07:11.927]  She's raging on some phone call.
[02:07:11.927 --> 02:07:15.889]  She's raging on some mystery phone call last night at the Congressional Baseball game.
[02:07:15.889 --> 02:07:18.051]  Mask-free, by the way.
[02:07:18.051 --> 02:07:18.931]  And then there she is.
[02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:25.636]  I mean, I don't know how else you would explain that other than it appears that she's inebriated in front of the press today.
[02:07:25.636 --> 02:07:29.278]  Boy, she is really on a roll, isn't she?
[02:07:29.278 --> 02:07:30.799]  She sure is, Owen.
[02:07:30.799 --> 02:07:32.160]  Good to be with you.
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:35.482]  She must have restocked her refrigerator with that beer.
[02:07:35.482 --> 02:07:36.363]  Oh yeah, that's right!
[02:07:37.324 --> 02:07:42.847]  January 6th, one of those protesters was arrested for drinking one of her beers.
[02:07:42.847 --> 02:07:46.169]  And so she must have restocked that fridge with ice cream and beer.
[02:07:46.169 --> 02:07:48.831]  She seemed very happy this morning.
[02:07:48.831 --> 02:07:53.374]  But again, it's hard to watch that woman, isn't it?
[02:07:53.374 --> 02:07:56.956]  The lies on top of lies on top of lies that come from her mouth.
[02:07:56.956 --> 02:08:00.758]  And you're right, it would be interesting to know who she was talking to last night.
[02:08:00.758 --> 02:08:04.040]  Was that, you know, Manchin?
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:06.962]  Was it Kristen Sinema from Arizona?
[02:08:07.523 --> 02:08:10.444]  Was it one of her, the squad members?
[02:08:10.444 --> 02:08:14.005]  Who was it that she's reaming out during the congressional baseball game?
[02:08:14.005 --> 02:08:22.867]  Because they're so desperate to pass this $3.5 trillion spending bill so they can spend $3.5 trillion but somehow it costs $0.
[02:08:22.867 --> 02:08:24.627]  At least that's the logic they want.
[02:08:24.627 --> 02:08:27.908]  But not all members of Congress are insane liars.
[02:08:27.908 --> 02:08:30.469]  You guys have this story right now at the Gateway Pundit.
[02:08:31.349 --> 02:08:32.869]  Not making headlines.
[02:08:32.869 --> 02:08:40.031]  Senator Ron Johnson just exposed on the Senate floor that COVID vaccines do not appear to work as advertised.
[02:08:40.031 --> 02:08:43.472]  And they've pretty much all admitted this now, Joe.
[02:08:43.472 --> 02:08:53.014]  Even Dr. abortion Lena Nguyen goes on CNN and says that now the vaccinated pose a risk to the unvaccinated because they're the ones causing the spread.
[02:08:53.014 --> 02:08:57.655]  And so that's their new argument is, hey, if you're unvaccinated, the vaccinated might get you sick.
[02:08:59.036 --> 02:09:00.257]  It's insane, isn't it?
[02:09:00.257 --> 02:09:02.378]  It changes every day, it seems to.
[02:09:02.378 --> 02:09:09.943]  And this chart that I posted up there, this was Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin yesterday speaking on the Senate floor.
[02:09:09.943 --> 02:09:11.844]  And if you look at this chart, it's amazing.
[02:09:11.844 --> 02:09:15.767]  What he states in his segment there is that
[02:09:16.543 --> 02:09:20.224]  The numbers for COVID was already coming down naturally.
[02:09:20.224 --> 02:09:23.884]  Then we had the injection of the vaccines.
[02:09:23.884 --> 02:09:31.626]  You can see the red line there is the vaccine numbers in the United States going up for the next three, four months to about 60% where it is today.
[02:09:31.626 --> 02:09:42.448]  And now that we have this huge amount, majority of Americans vaccinated, you can see it didn't stop the COVID from coming back late this summer.
[02:09:43.312 --> 02:09:45.734]  To where it is today with this Delta variant.
[02:09:45.734 --> 02:09:48.557]  So it did nothing to stop the Delta variant.
[02:09:48.557 --> 02:09:53.440]  And again, we see that now the Delta variant is naturally coming back down.
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:57.944]  So, Johnson gave an amazing speech there.
[02:09:57.944 --> 02:10:11.535]  And he just lays it out with the facts and the numbers that it appears that these vaccines had nothing to do with this pandemic spreading.
[02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:16.028]  I had nothing to do with the pandemic ending naturally.
[02:10:16.028 --> 02:10:19.435]  And so I hope your audience watches that.
[02:10:19.435 --> 02:10:22.021]  It's two minutes long and it's just fantastic.
[02:10:22.608 --> 02:10:29.911]  Well, not only that, if you look at the graph, and this is basic math, I mean, any elementary school student could point this out.
[02:10:29.911 --> 02:10:38.695]  It's clear that the resurgence of COVID or Delta or whatever they want to call it, comes almost exactly at the same rate of the vaccine.
[02:10:38.695 --> 02:10:41.817]  I mean, right there, it's like, there's the vaccine, there's the COVID rate.
[02:10:41.817 --> 02:10:44.798]  I mean, it's, you know, it's pretty much right there.
[02:10:44.798 --> 02:10:46.559]  Yeah, right in front of our eyes.
[02:10:46.559 --> 02:10:48.000]  And yet we have this nonsense.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.921]  These people continue to throw at us and hurl at us.
[02:10:52.074 --> 02:11:07.978]  Including Dr. Fauci, this megalomaniac, who was behind the creation of this vaccine, who was funding it, who's the producer of the coronavirus at the Wuhan lab, and yet now he's the one who's trying to tell us how to deal with this.
[02:11:07.978 --> 02:11:10.798]  It's absolutely insane.
[02:11:10.798 --> 02:11:16.299]  I took a trip to the airport yesterday to drop off a loved one at the airport.
[02:11:16.299 --> 02:11:18.540]  You put on the mask, you go inside,
[02:11:20.004 --> 02:11:26.290]  You know, you have to make sure you have a vaccine or a shot if you're going overseas.
[02:11:26.290 --> 02:11:33.336]  It's absolute insanity and it doesn't appear that any of this is working and yet Dr. Fauci is still in charge.
[02:11:33.336 --> 02:11:46.308]  I have a theory that this will not clear up until Dr. Fauci is gone and he should be prosecuted because what he's done is committed mass murder by allowing, by condemning hydroxychloroquine
[02:11:46.847 --> 02:11:56.377]  And Ivermectin, which could have saved millions of lives right now, but he politically used that as a political bludgeon to hit Trump.
[02:11:56.377 --> 02:12:04.226]  And now we know that those are effective means to treat this coronavirus and he prevented people from using it.
[02:12:04.226 --> 02:12:04.947]  It's outrageous.
[02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:20.820]  Well, not only that, I guess the CEOs of big pharma run the country now, and the CEO of biotech, I think it was the CEO, but somebody at biotech comes out and says, yeah, COVID's here forever, but don't worry, with us, we'll be able to manage it.
[02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:25.804]  Meaning you're going to be a prisoner, essentially, in the new COVID world.
[02:12:25.804 --> 02:12:29.927]  But don't worry, because Biotech and Pfizer, they have our backs.
[02:12:29.927 --> 02:12:41.577]  Even though, like you said, they banned ivermectin from being used, but now Pfizer is about to release its own ivermectin that I'm sure will be okay to use now at five times the price of the normal ivermectin.
[02:12:42.526 --> 02:12:44.207]  Yeah, at least five times the price.
[02:12:44.207 --> 02:12:52.374]  And, you know, we put up a story, we put it last week, where they're using this in a province or district over in India, having amazing results.
[02:12:53.065 --> 02:13:00.549]  Their cases of coronavirus have been limited after they started pushing the ivermectin in India.
[02:13:00.549 --> 02:13:05.431]  So, again, the media has lied about this continuously.
[02:13:05.431 --> 02:13:20.479]  People like you guys at InfoWars and The War Room and Gabriel Pundit, we get bludgeoned by these dirty politicians and the mainstream media for putting up what ends up to be the truth time and time again.
[02:13:22.145 --> 02:13:34.055]  Well, and it's so frustrating, too, not just reporting on it in real time, but if you go back in time, we were reporting on this before it even happened, because this is what all the doctors and scientists were telling us.
[02:13:34.055 --> 02:13:37.839]  They said, look, the vaccine is actually going to get people sick.
[02:13:37.839 --> 02:13:40.241]  The vaccine is going to cause these cytokine storms.
[02:13:40.241 --> 02:13:42.422]  The vaccine is going to cause the variants.
[02:13:42.422 --> 02:13:49.469]  And then all of that happened a year later after the doctors and scientists that were being censored off the internet told us, and now we're just watching it all happen.
[02:13:50.249 --> 02:14:00.451]  And, like you said, we were attacked for reporting that truth a year ago, and I guess now we know why they were censoring those doctors, because how else could they sell all these vaccines?
[02:14:00.451 --> 02:14:02.252]  How else could they sell these boosters?
[02:14:02.252 --> 02:14:04.732]  How else could they ban ivermectin and all these things?
[02:14:04.732 --> 02:14:08.713]  Well, they didn't want you to know that they knew that this was going to happen.
[02:14:08.713 --> 02:14:10.633]  They knew the vaccine was going to cause the variants.
[02:14:10.633 --> 02:14:13.134]  They knew that the vaccinated were going to be a threat to the unvaccinated.
[02:14:13.134 --> 02:14:19.035]  Now it's all here, and so they're just saying, well, this is just a big pharmaceutical takeover, so just get over it.
[02:14:20.478 --> 02:14:22.539]  Yeah, it's insane.
[02:14:22.539 --> 02:14:30.004]  And we continue, Owen, to see these stories time and time again of what we're seeing.
[02:14:30.004 --> 02:14:34.967]  The vaccinated now are the ones who are going into hospital, who are the ones who are getting sick.
[02:14:34.967 --> 02:14:44.173]  There was a story out of Australia where six of the seven people who died in New Wales, South New Wales, were already vaccinated.
[02:14:44.173 --> 02:14:47.215]  And of course, the majority was over 70 or 80 years old.
[02:14:49.326 --> 02:14:53.130]  So, again, we get proven right with time.
[02:14:53.130 --> 02:14:55.292]  People with integrity expect to be believed.
[02:14:55.292 --> 02:14:57.714]  When they're not, they let time prove them right.
[02:14:57.714 --> 02:15:00.016]  And that's what's going on right now.
[02:15:00.016 --> 02:15:12.167]  And people are just losing trust with our medical community, which is really a shame because we, you know, how did we know two years ago that our medical community was so corrupt?
[02:15:12.167 --> 02:15:12.848]  We do today.
[02:15:14.498 --> 02:15:21.064]  And by the way, that video clip that you're mentioning is one of the most crazy things ever, because it's like, it just gets more insane in the 50 seconds as it goes on.
[02:15:21.064 --> 02:15:23.547]  First they're like, oh my gosh, seven people died.
[02:15:23.547 --> 02:15:25.208]  You're like, seven people?
[02:15:25.208 --> 02:15:25.569]  That's it?
[02:15:25.569 --> 02:15:26.730]  And you have all this tyranny?
[02:15:26.730 --> 02:15:30.593]  And then it's like, six of the seven had vaccines.
[02:15:30.593 --> 02:15:31.815]  And they're like, wait, what?
[02:15:31.815 --> 02:15:33.136]  And then it was the vaccinated?
[02:15:33.136 --> 02:15:36.319]  It's just, it's just complete madness.
[02:15:36.319 --> 02:15:38.061]  Jim Hoft is with us from the Gateway Pundit.
[02:15:38.061 --> 02:15:39.001]  We're about to go to a break.
[02:15:39.912 --> 02:15:50.465]  We'll get into some of the other breaking news that's breaking at InfoWars and Gateway Planet right now, including members of the military being persecuted by the Democrats because they speak out against Biden.
[02:15:50.465 --> 02:15:56.253]  And speaking of Biden, he just can't stop harassing women as he does it again last night at a baseball game.
[02:15:58.939 --> 02:16:01.021]  Your voice counts.
[02:16:01.021 --> 02:16:06.087]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:16:06.087 --> 02:16:08.670]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:16:08.670 --> 02:16:10.172]  They know you're angry.
[02:16:10.172 --> 02:16:14.998]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[02:16:15.538 --> 02:16:26.305]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles, and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports, and share them with everyone you know.
[02:16:26.305 --> 02:16:30.628]  Take action now by texting the word NEWS, N-E-W-S, to 833-470-0438.
[02:16:30.628 --> 02:16:33.030]  That's 833-470-0438 for InfoWars Emergency News Alerts.
[02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:35.211]  Or, text the word SHOW to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications.
[02:16:45.638 --> 02:16:50.121]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction, and tell others to share those texts.

[02:16:56.465 --> 02:17:04.892]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:17:04.892 --> 02:17:05.913]  Here's why.
[02:17:05.913 --> 02:17:09.837]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:17:09.837 --> 02:17:14.961]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:17:14.961 --> 02:17:23.389]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:17:23.929 --> 02:17:31.945]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:38.721]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.

[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:46.761]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:22.344 --> 02:20:24.886]  Jim Hoft is our guest here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.886 --> 02:20:27.688]  Owen Schroer sitting in studio for Alex.
[02:20:27.688 --> 02:20:29.750]  Some of the latest headlines from the Gateway Pundit.
[02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:30.231]  Here's one.
[02:20:30.231 --> 02:20:32.272]  This is a very big story.
[02:20:32.272 --> 02:20:42.240]  Lance Corporal Hunter Clark, who rescued Baby in Kabul, is under investigation by the Department of Defense for speaking at Trump rally out of uniform.
[02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:48.565]  And also they have arrested now Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer for daring to call out the failed
[02:20:49.266 --> 02:20:52.515]  Biden regime strategy in Afghanistan, so so.
[02:20:53.561 --> 02:20:55.022]  You know, Jim, here's the story to me.
[02:20:55.022 --> 02:21:00.044]  The left is allowed to have their politicized operatives inside the military and everywhere else.
[02:21:00.044 --> 02:21:06.207]  They're allowed to do that and they can criticize Trump and backstab Trump and, hell, make calls to China outside of the chain of command.
[02:21:06.207 --> 02:21:17.332]  But, oh, one little guy, one little guy in the military dares step up and say the truth or dares say, hey, look, Trump's a good guy and they suffer the full force of the rules and regulations.
[02:21:17.332 --> 02:21:20.514]  It's just yet another example of the left's double standards now in the military.
[02:21:21.684 --> 02:21:22.565]  Absolutely.
[02:21:22.565 --> 02:21:37.659]  As you recall, last year or two years ago, Owed, Bidman, who went in to testify against Trump, this leaker who was behind the first impeachment of Trump over a phone call.
[02:21:37.659 --> 02:21:40.261]  He comes in in full dress uniform, right?
[02:21:40.261 --> 02:21:41.602]  That's okay with the left.
[02:21:41.602 --> 02:21:43.504]  That was perfectly fine.
[02:21:43.504 --> 02:21:47.308]  To testify against the Commander-in-Chief, he had to wear his uniform dress.
[02:21:47.847 --> 02:22:02.963]  But this hero who was stuck in Kabul was rescuing babies, people were just handing to him over the wall, made international news because it was so shocking what was happening in Kabul as we all watched this.
[02:22:02.963 --> 02:22:07.468]  Now he's under investigation because Trump called him up and he said to the crowd,
[02:22:08.228 --> 02:22:14.809]  Literally, he said, this is the most, the proudest I've ever been in my life was rescuing this baby.
[02:22:14.809 --> 02:22:16.110]  That's all he said.
[02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:20.911]  And then he walked off the stage and shook Trump's hand.
[02:22:20.911 --> 02:22:22.891]  And now he's under investigation.
[02:22:22.891 --> 02:22:31.173]  It's really unbelievable, Owen, because we have generals sitting in front of Congress who just surrendered Afghanistan.
[02:22:31.173 --> 02:22:33.613]  They armed the Taliban with $85 billion of U.S.
[02:22:33.613 --> 02:22:34.074]  weapons.
[02:22:36.641 --> 02:22:40.524]  They've left thousands of Americans and green card holders over there.
[02:22:40.524 --> 02:22:45.947]  They allowed other Afghans to just bum rush the airport.
[02:22:45.947 --> 02:22:47.308]  We don't know who the hell they are.
[02:22:47.308 --> 02:22:49.470]  They're just being spread all over the country.
[02:22:49.470 --> 02:22:54.493]  They're already raping kids and harassing women at some of these bases.
[02:22:54.493 --> 02:22:58.236]  And yet these generals who sit there, there's nothing that happens to them.
[02:22:58.236 --> 02:23:04.480]  Only this hero, this one kid who was there in Kabul saving babies, now he's the one under investigation.
[02:23:06.237 --> 02:23:07.318]  Completely upside down.
[02:23:07.318 --> 02:23:14.564]  And I think people are getting furious about this nonsense and this absolute corruption we're seeing in the U.S.
[02:23:14.564 --> 02:23:16.245]  military.
[02:23:16.245 --> 02:23:20.128]  It's really sad to see just all the political persecution happening.
[02:23:20.128 --> 02:23:22.630]  But even the military now, it's reaching there.
[02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:26.893]  And again, they throw Scheller in the brig.
[02:23:26.893 --> 02:23:28.214]  Who knows if he'll ever be out.
[02:23:28.214 --> 02:23:32.217]  There have been multiple petitions coming from Republicans in Congress to have him released.
[02:23:32.998 --> 02:23:42.224]  And now you've got this Lance Corporal Hunter Clark who's under investigation simply for stepping up saying, hey, I'm so glad I saved this baby, I love America, and shaking Trump's hand.
[02:23:42.224 --> 02:23:44.385]  That's apparently worthy of an investigation.
[02:23:44.385 --> 02:23:53.010]  But hey, General Milley can go outside, chain of command, and call China, and do book leaks with Bob Woodward and the rest of it, and that's all fine and dandy, and that's all fine and good.
[02:23:54.111 --> 02:24:07.527]  But, you know, speaking of the Biden issue here, so he cancels, he was supposed to be in Chicago yesterday to talk about the vaccine mandates because Chicago, a large black American population, doesn't want to get the vaccine.
[02:24:07.527 --> 02:24:09.830]  So he was supposed to go push vaccines on them yesterday.
[02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:13.855]  I guess, considering that the homicide rate in Chicago is through the roof,
[02:24:14.375 --> 02:24:15.795]  And he thought maybe that would be the story.
[02:24:15.795 --> 02:24:17.096]  He decided to abandon that.
[02:24:17.096 --> 02:24:26.317]  Or maybe he had to stay behind because all the lies he told about Afghanistan are now coming out in these congressional hearings with Milley and Austin, so he had to stay behind to run cover for that.
[02:24:26.317 --> 02:24:36.999]  Either way, he shows up to the baseball game last night, mask-free, and immediately saunters over to some innocent woman, boxes her in, and gets right in her face without a mask.
[02:24:36.999 --> 02:24:39.120]  Do we have any idea who this woman is, by the way?
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:40.320]  I don't know anybody that's ID'd her.
[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:41.560]  Has the Gateway Pundit been able to?
[02:24:42.788 --> 02:24:45.970]  We haven't identified her yet, but again, that's a great way to describe it.
[02:24:45.970 --> 02:24:47.010]  He boxes her in.
[02:24:47.010 --> 02:24:50.191]  He puts his arms to where she's a captive.
[02:24:50.191 --> 02:24:51.832]  I mean, who does that?
[02:24:51.832 --> 02:25:01.797]  I used to work in human resources for a while, Owen, and I know there was one man who worked where I was at, and every time he came in a room, he'd go, you know, a beeline to the women.
[02:25:01.797 --> 02:25:07.339]  He always put his hands on them, you know, and chum up with them, and it was really kind of disgusting.
[02:25:07.339 --> 02:25:11.421]  That's Joe Biden, except Joe Biden does it with women and children.
[02:25:12.014 --> 02:25:13.295]  And he sniffs her hair.
[02:25:13.295 --> 02:25:16.456]  This is one creepy dude.
[02:25:16.456 --> 02:25:18.337]  He can't stop it.
[02:25:18.337 --> 02:25:20.518]  He does this wherever he goes.
[02:25:20.518 --> 02:25:22.959]  And the left gives him a complete pass.
[02:25:22.959 --> 02:25:28.742]  They want us to think that Donald Trump is some sort of perp when they have this guy in the White House?
[02:25:28.742 --> 02:25:29.682]  It's unbelievable.
[02:25:29.682 --> 02:25:30.482]  I mean, look at that.
[02:25:30.482 --> 02:25:31.923]  Who does that, Owen?
[02:25:31.923 --> 02:25:33.684]  I've never done that in my life.
[02:25:34.905 --> 02:25:40.014]  To just kind of hold someone captive like that and sit there and flirt with them.
[02:25:40.014 --> 02:25:41.816]  It's so damn creepy.
[02:25:41.816 --> 02:25:44.340]  And yet, is the media going to say anything about this today?
[02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:46.244]  We all know the answer to that.
[02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:53.243]  And again, not to mention, this is the guy promoting that, hell, wear two masks, wear the triple mask if you can.
[02:25:53.243 --> 02:25:55.964]  Please, I'm Joe Biden, I want you to live in fear.
[02:25:55.964 --> 02:26:04.349]  But then he goes and he gets right in this woman's face, woman's face, walks around the ballpark without a mask on, as they encourage everybody else, you have to wear a mask all the time.
[02:26:05.109 --> 02:26:07.530]  He gets in this woman's face without a mask.
[02:26:07.530 --> 02:26:10.752]  And I don't know if you saw the story the other week.
[02:26:10.752 --> 02:26:12.473]  It pretty much went uncovered.
[02:26:12.473 --> 02:26:15.654]  I keep bringing it up, hoping that it'll finally go viral.
[02:26:15.654 --> 02:26:17.175]  And I believe it was in Slate.
[02:26:17.175 --> 02:26:18.795]  And guys, try to pull it up for me.
[02:26:18.795 --> 02:26:20.076]  I think it was in Slate, but I can't remember.
[02:26:20.076 --> 02:26:28.200]  But it's basically, the actual grassroots people of the Me Too movement and the Time's Up movement have now realized, and they've admitted, and they've written stories.
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:31.141]  There was a big one just in Slate, where the Time's Up movement went wrong.
[02:26:31.141 --> 02:26:32.362]  And they admit, we were fooled.
[02:26:32.702 --> 02:26:35.063]  It was a Democrat operation from the get-go.
[02:26:35.063 --> 02:26:36.704]  It had nothing to do with women.
[02:26:36.704 --> 02:26:38.645]  It was all about the Democrats.
[02:26:38.645 --> 02:26:40.265]  It was all about attacking Trump.
[02:26:40.265 --> 02:26:46.988]  And their final straw was they found out... First of all, the head honchos were all making just six-figure salaries somehow.
[02:26:46.988 --> 02:26:48.249]  They don't get anything.
[02:26:48.249 --> 02:26:52.771]  And then they found out that during the Cuomo scandal, they thought, oh, time's up.
[02:26:52.771 --> 02:26:58.233]  Me too would be helping these women that have accused a powerful man, Cuomo, of the charges.
[02:26:58.233 --> 02:26:59.253]  And guess what?
[02:26:59.253 --> 02:27:00.374]  They went after the women!
[02:27:00.914 --> 02:27:16.552]  They slandered and attacked the women, and so they wrote this huge article like we were fooled, Time's Up and Me Too was never about women, it was always about the Democrat Party, now they're attacking victims of these men, and it's like it just kind of just was like a tumbleweed in the desert, Jim, nobody cared.
[02:27:17.711 --> 02:27:20.472]  Yeah, it's like Clinton 2.0, isn't it?
[02:27:20.472 --> 02:27:23.654]  You know, where they were going after those women, too.
[02:27:23.654 --> 02:27:25.214]  It's unbelievable what these people do.
[02:27:25.214 --> 02:27:33.298]  And isn't it interesting, too, that the Me Too movement, I guess they gave up on that because everybody they were catching were Democrats, you know?
[02:27:33.298 --> 02:27:34.658]  And so they got tired of that.
[02:27:34.658 --> 02:27:38.300]  They kept knocking all these Democrats off of these top platforms.
[02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:40.661]  So anyway, but you're right.
[02:27:40.661 --> 02:27:42.121]  It never was about the women.
[02:27:42.121 --> 02:27:43.502]  It never was about harassment.
[02:27:43.502 --> 02:27:46.123]  It's just about how they could have punished Trump.
[02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:48.911]  Um, uh, which didn't work by the way.
[02:27:48.911 --> 02:27:51.372]  Um, but, uh, you're absolutely right.
[02:27:51.372 --> 02:27:53.673]  They don't, they don't care about these women that are getting hurt.
[02:27:53.673 --> 02:28:02.337]  And, and, and just as an example, what we were just talking about, Joe Biden boxing in this woman last night and holding her captive at the baseball game.
[02:28:03.567 --> 02:28:12.049]  And think about the hubris that he has, even knowing that the Me Too, you know, thing kind of still lurks out there as a media talking point.
[02:28:12.049 --> 02:28:14.570]  He has no qualms, he has no hesitation.
[02:28:14.570 --> 02:28:16.951]  Kids goes up, sniffs them, touches them.
[02:28:16.951 --> 02:28:19.991]  Women goes right up, sniffs them, touches them, boxes them in.
[02:28:19.991 --> 02:28:26.253]  He's got so much confidence that the media is going to protect him, that he just does it anyway without even a single hesitation.
[02:28:28.510 --> 02:28:29.190]  Absolutely.
[02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:30.091]  He can't help it.
[02:28:30.091 --> 02:28:30.991]  He doesn't care.
[02:28:30.991 --> 02:28:32.211]  They don't care.
[02:28:32.211 --> 02:28:35.492]  If they did care, they'd be saying more about it.
[02:28:35.492 --> 02:28:38.994]  But again, we don't see this making any headlines today.
[02:28:38.994 --> 02:28:43.515]  And it explains a lot about his son and his strange behavior.
[02:28:44.402 --> 02:28:49.505]  Ultra strange that he could have orgies with so many people around the world.
[02:28:49.505 --> 02:28:52.106]  And literally do porn videos for the internet.
[02:28:52.106 --> 02:28:56.008]  Let's just hope that Biden had a real diaper on since he didn't have the face diaper on.
[02:28:56.008 --> 02:29:04.433]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:29:04.433 --> 02:29:05.453]  Here's why.
[02:29:05.453 --> 02:29:08.755]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:29:09.355 --> 02:29:14.496]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:29:14.496 --> 02:29:23.479]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:29:23.479 --> 02:29:31.461]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.

[02:29:57.059 --> 02:30:06.212]  People ask me, Alex, why did you come out with a new natural organic sleep aid when you already have knockout that works so well with eight natural ingredients?
[02:30:06.212 --> 02:30:13.443]  Well, because when you've taken a certain organic blend for a decade, like I've taken this product I came up with, it doesn't work as well anymore.
[02:30:13.703 --> 02:30:15.004]  That's the way herbs work.
[02:30:15.004 --> 02:30:18.466]  You go off on a while, come back on it, it works again.
[02:30:18.466 --> 02:30:19.146]  So what did I do?
[02:30:19.146 --> 02:30:30.373]  I went to the developers and I said, make a totally different formula with a lot of other known natural healthy compounds that make you sleep deep and restful, because that's what helps your immune system, and I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout.
[02:30:31.073 --> 02:30:32.895]  Okay, be careful when you take it.
[02:30:32.895 --> 02:30:34.236]  It's incredibly strong.
[02:30:34.236 --> 02:30:35.297]  It's named Down-N-Out.
[02:30:35.297 --> 02:30:40.681]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it, but it is extremely strong and we are extremely proud of it.

[02:31:01.249 --> 02:31:02.410]  Granny Do-Right.
[02:31:02.410 --> 02:31:03.230]  Granny Do-Right.
[02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:04.311]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:31:04.311 --> 02:31:04.871]  Go ahead.
[02:31:04.871 --> 02:31:05.391]  Hey, Alex.
[02:31:05.391 --> 02:31:08.013]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[02:31:08.013 --> 02:31:09.053]  I am a granny.
[02:31:09.053 --> 02:31:18.718]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[02:31:18.718 --> 02:31:24.722]  But since taking Eurex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[02:31:24.722 --> 02:31:25.742]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[02:31:28.003 --> 02:31:35.727]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[02:31:35.727 --> 02:31:44.472]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, OK, you know, this is a ticket.
[02:31:44.472 --> 02:31:45.292]  This is working.
[02:31:45.292 --> 02:31:46.293]  This is wonderful.
[02:31:46.293 --> 02:31:50.835]  You know, I don't I don't have to put it on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[02:31:50.835 --> 02:31:55.478]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[02:31:57.486 --> 02:32:03.428]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems of these employees.
[02:32:03.428 --> 02:32:14.251]  Because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[02:32:14.251 --> 02:32:17.572]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[02:32:17.572 --> 02:32:19.172]  That taxes the heart.
[02:32:19.172 --> 02:32:20.553]  It taxes the lungs.
[02:32:20.553 --> 02:32:22.373]  And we have given people heart attacks.
[02:32:22.373 --> 02:32:23.654]  By allowing them to work,
[02:32:24.574 --> 02:32:31.900]  With our mouth and nose covered, with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[02:32:31.900 --> 02:32:34.082]  The globalists have told us we're a disease.
[02:32:34.082 --> 02:32:35.983]  They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[02:32:35.983 --> 02:32:44.931]  And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up to one-third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[02:32:44.931 --> 02:32:47.593]  This is a sick cult and we've got to say no.
[02:32:47.593 --> 02:32:51.096]  But the only way the real science gets out to the public is if we tell them.
[02:32:51.556 --> 02:32:54.741]  Get your copy today of COVIDLAND and expose them.
[02:32:54.741 --> 02:32:56.022]  It's COVIDLAND.com.
[02:32:56.022 --> 02:33:00.028]  Go there now.
[02:33:00.028 --> 02:33:02.631]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.932 --> 02:33:19.613]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:19.613 --> 02:33:21.334]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:21.334 --> 02:33:23.275]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.275 --> 02:33:27.877]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:27.877 --> 02:33:34.020]  Ah, yes, the vaccine religious cult continues to just get weirder and weirder every day.
[02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:35.360]  That's fine.
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:37.742]  We'll let them do that.
[02:33:37.742 --> 02:33:42.184]  Jim Hoft, one more segment with us from the Gateway Pundit.
[02:33:42.184 --> 02:33:46.346]  And you guys have another incredible story here with the video, which is just as powerful
[02:33:47.543 --> 02:33:49.466]  There were large pieces torn off.
[02:33:49.466 --> 02:33:52.810]  Bubbles being filled absolutely perfect.
[02:33:52.810 --> 02:33:53.952]  60,000 illegal ballots.
[02:33:53.952 --> 02:33:57.437]  Arizona audit volunteers speak out on disturbing findings.
[02:33:57.437 --> 02:33:58.218]  Must-see video.
[02:33:58.218 --> 02:34:00.962]  It's there on the Gateway Pundit.
[02:34:00.962 --> 02:34:04.006]  So, the Attorney General of Arizona is taking this seriously.
[02:34:04.890 --> 02:34:08.153]  I think he's a little perturbed at the current time.
[02:34:08.153 --> 02:34:09.835]  I'd like your take on this.
[02:34:09.835 --> 02:34:23.127]  To me, Attorney General Brnovich seems to be just aghast at the fact that they did the audit, they have the evidence, he's now preserved the evidence for further litigation, maybe a criminal investigation incoming.
[02:34:23.687 --> 02:34:37.807]  But he's like, okay, sharing it with the media, sharing it with the State Senate, sharing it with the representatives, sharing it with the Congress, and it's just like, falls on deaf ears, and he's just like, wait a second, here's the audit, here's the proof, election interference, and it's like, nobody cares!
[02:34:39.514 --> 02:34:43.237]  Right, it's unbelievable, isn't it?
[02:34:43.237 --> 02:34:53.105]  It should have been predictable, and we should have known this was coming, but the night before they released the audit results, the media already came out with their talking point.
[02:34:53.105 --> 02:34:59.951]  They said that the ballots were recounted, they found the same amount, a few more, a few less, and Joe Biden won.
[02:35:00.413 --> 02:35:03.775]  And this is what it says is Joe Biden won and there was no fraud.
[02:35:03.775 --> 02:35:09.939]  So the media immediately came out with this big, the big lie, which was that there was no fraud.
[02:35:09.939 --> 02:35:16.204]  Today, we put up a post to get repugnant of the different categories of ballots that they had trouble with.
[02:35:16.204 --> 02:35:18.505]  Over 700,000 ballots.
[02:35:18.505 --> 02:35:24.869]  Some of these might have been, you know, qualified for different categories, but these ballots had issues.
[02:35:24.869 --> 02:35:27.251]  They need to be investigated, including 83,000.
[02:35:29.175 --> 02:35:32.577]  That they looked at, and this doesn't get any press, right?
[02:35:32.577 --> 02:35:38.021]  You imagine if this was reversed, if it was Democrats and Republicans who were, you know, reversed here.
[02:35:38.021 --> 02:35:52.431]  83,000 of these votes, these ballots in Maricopa County, they looked these people up, they couldn't find the social security number, they couldn't find the names that correlated, they couldn't find the address, couldn't find anything.
[02:35:53.404 --> 02:36:01.591]  So they're saying they have 83,000 of this in an election in a state where Trump lost by 10,300 votes.
[02:36:01.591 --> 02:36:01.991]  Lost.
[02:36:01.991 --> 02:36:09.097]  I put that in air quotes because we still believe that Trump won and had this stolen, but they need to investigate this.
[02:36:09.637 --> 02:36:15.561]  Attorney General Brnovich needs to start an investigation and press some criminal charges.
[02:36:15.561 --> 02:36:32.613]  We also know, through this hearing they had on Friday, was that they found Maricopa County officials or people who are linked to the county, who are working on the voting machines, they found them deleting files before they turned them over.
[02:36:33.168 --> 02:36:40.614]  So the day before these Dominion voting machines were turned over to the audit officials, they deleted all these files.
[02:36:40.614 --> 02:36:42.997]  Which is a crime, by the way.
[02:36:42.997 --> 02:36:44.558]  Absolutely, it's a crime.
[02:36:45.206 --> 02:36:50.791]  And they actually said during the hearing that they know who was deleting the files.
[02:36:50.791 --> 02:36:53.593]  So they need to press these criminal charges.
[02:36:53.593 --> 02:37:01.939]  They need to investigate this or Democrats will continue to get away with this, you know, election cycle after election cycle.
[02:37:01.939 --> 02:37:05.362]  And it really is the end of our country if we can't fix these elections.
[02:37:05.362 --> 02:37:14.209]  But we believe there's enough there for charges, as you just said, Owen, to be filed and that they need to look further at some of these ballots.
[02:37:14.605 --> 02:37:26.737]  Because if they did, if they actually did canvassing in the state, they would find that these aren't real ballots, these aren't real people, and it could be up in the hundreds of thousands at this point.
[02:37:27.338 --> 02:37:30.479]  And I can't even imagine what's going on behind the scenes.
[02:37:30.479 --> 02:37:38.023]  And here's the panic from the Democrats, because they know this is the loose thread that pulls the entire sweater that exposes the naked emperor.
[02:37:38.023 --> 02:37:42.965]  They know that this is the first domino to fall if it really legitimately gets pushed over.
[02:37:42.965 --> 02:37:46.907]  So that's why they've done everything, including committing crimes, to try to stop this from happening.
[02:37:46.907 --> 02:37:47.627]  And so I agree.
[02:37:47.627 --> 02:37:48.448]  And here's the problem.
[02:37:50.018 --> 02:37:57.286]  Tommy Tuberville, Senator in Alabama says, I hope we look at impeachment and Democrat House Committee assignments after the 2022 midterms.
[02:37:57.286 --> 02:37:57.887]  Hey, I get it.
[02:37:57.887 --> 02:38:01.051]  I mean, Biden has already had articles of impeachment filed against him.
[02:38:01.051 --> 02:38:05.055]  It's just the media won't cover it and Republicans are too cowardly to get behind it.
[02:38:05.055 --> 02:38:05.896]  But that's the problem is...
[02:38:07.057 --> 02:38:11.378]  So many people have lost faith in the elections after the 2020 presidential elections.
[02:38:11.378 --> 02:38:18.041]  And when I hear people say, oh, everything looks good for the midterms for Republicans, everything looked great in the 2020 presidential election for Trump!
[02:38:18.041 --> 02:38:20.041]  Everything looked great, and look what happened with that!
[02:38:20.041 --> 02:38:28.844]  So, this is a serious problem that we have in this country, and with the lack of confidence in the vote now, you know, I don't know how we overcome it.
[02:38:30.188 --> 02:38:34.571]  Right, unless they continue these audits and people go to jail.
[02:38:34.571 --> 02:38:40.736]  That's the only thing that's going to stop these Democrats is if they start going to prison.
[02:38:40.736 --> 02:38:42.797]  So they have to investigate this.
[02:38:42.797 --> 02:38:47.220]  Attorney General Brnovich in Arizona, he is running for the Senate.
[02:38:47.220 --> 02:38:51.223]  By the way, that's our video from Gateway Pundit right there that you're showing right now on the screen.
[02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:59.757]  That's from the TCF Center in Detroit, that we were the only ones in the country who got this video, who requested it, and it took us months to get it.
[02:38:59.757 --> 02:39:04.901]  That's them leaking the ballots into the TCF Center on election night at 3.30 in the morning.
[02:39:04.901 --> 02:39:08.544]  And by the way, you guys have more surveillance footage now.
[02:39:09.364 --> 02:39:17.190]  Of, I think it was what, like 20 people depositing thousands of ballots in one of the Zuckerberg ballot boxes.
[02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:24.596]  So you had 20 Democrats, we're assuming, sorry, 20 people voting thousands of times in Georgia.
[02:39:24.596 --> 02:39:29.640]  Right, and you know the news behind that, Owen, and I could share this with you.
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:34.724]  We know that True the Vote organization is from Texas, down in your neck of the woods.
[02:39:34.724 --> 02:39:37.045]  Katherine Engelbrecht, she's been doing this for years.
[02:39:37.045 --> 02:39:39.007]  She just wants to clean up the voter rolls, right?
[02:39:39.731 --> 02:39:44.532]  And for that, she got persecuted by Obama back when he was in office.
[02:39:44.532 --> 02:39:59.675]  Anyway, she's doing this investigation right now where they say they have identified several operatives dropping mass amounts of ballots into these drop boxes at night in not just Georgia now, Owen, in several of the swing states.
[02:39:59.675 --> 02:40:02.536]  They're working on that investigation.
[02:40:02.536 --> 02:40:03.936]  She had a meeting this week.
[02:40:03.936 --> 02:40:05.396]  We posted about that.
[02:40:05.396 --> 02:40:08.537]  I haven't spoken with her since she had this meeting, but she's telling me that the
[02:40:08.959 --> 02:40:13.962]  It's about to hit the fan, so to speak, with this investigation.
[02:40:13.962 --> 02:40:16.604]  So once again, we're going to have more proof.
[02:40:16.604 --> 02:40:22.028]  It sounds like that they were stuffing the ballot boxes late at night.
[02:40:22.028 --> 02:40:24.169]  It was planned.
[02:40:24.169 --> 02:40:25.090]  It was coordinated.
[02:40:25.826 --> 02:40:28.408]  It sounds like they were doing the same thing in several states.
[02:40:28.408 --> 02:40:30.429]  It could be a RICO investigation.
[02:40:30.429 --> 02:40:32.650]  But this is the criminal left.
[02:40:32.650 --> 02:40:34.931]  This is what they did to steal this election.
[02:40:34.931 --> 02:40:38.593]  And, you know, God willing, and I do pray to God that he exposes all of this.
[02:40:40.103 --> 02:40:49.488]  It's definitely needed because it's the only hope we have of getting neocon frauds like Liz Cheney out of office who can be seen today praising General Milley.
[02:40:49.488 --> 02:40:50.649]  Of course she is.
[02:40:50.649 --> 02:40:52.690]  Praising General Milley.
[02:40:52.690 --> 02:40:53.790]  So that's going on.
[02:40:53.790 --> 02:40:57.653]  Also, and I'm sure the Gateway Pundit will be all over this developing story right now, Jim.
[02:40:58.633 --> 02:41:04.637]  You have, first of all, IG Horowitz discovers more FISA abuses by the FBI.
[02:41:04.637 --> 02:41:10.141]  Hundreds of abuses, actually, discovered by Horowitz that got dropped today.
[02:41:10.141 --> 02:41:11.902]  TechnoFog is covering that.
[02:41:11.902 --> 02:41:14.924]  A bad day for FBI Director Chris Wray.
[02:41:14.924 --> 02:41:15.825]  We'll see about that.
[02:41:15.825 --> 02:41:17.526]  He's gotten away with so much at this point.
[02:41:17.526 --> 02:41:23.990]  And then, Durham issues new subpoenas in probe of FBI Russia investigation targets Clinton campaign law firm.
[02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:27.012]  So not just the one attorney, now it's the whole law firm, Jim.
[02:41:27.012 --> 02:41:28.093]  This is all breaking right now.
[02:41:31.895 --> 02:41:45.124]  Maybe Durham is going to do something, although I hear there might be some concern that they won't fund him, that the Attorney General Merrick Garland won't fund his investigation in a few more weeks, so maybe he's trying to pile it on right now.
[02:41:45.124 --> 02:41:52.129]  I haven't read enough about that, but at least we're hearing something, you know, where we didn't hear anything for over a year.
[02:41:53.732 --> 02:41:57.878]  Yeah, let's hope Durham actually does the job we've all been wanting him to do for so long.
[02:41:57.878 --> 02:42:01.623]  Hopefully it's not a day late or a dollar short.
[02:42:01.623 --> 02:42:03.365]  But of course, we have to cover this.
[02:42:03.365 --> 02:42:08.191]  The Gateway Pundit's going to have to cover this to blast it out there because the mainstream news is going to act like it's not going on.
[02:42:09.072 --> 02:42:10.493]  Jim, always great to hear from you.
[02:42:10.493 --> 02:42:12.053]  And by the way, congratulations.
[02:42:12.053 --> 02:42:14.474]  I'm so glad you guys are live on the air up there in St.
[02:42:14.474 --> 02:42:14.814]  Louis.
[02:42:14.814 --> 02:42:19.655]  That radio station that just launched, it's like a dream of mine from a decade ago when I was in St.
[02:42:19.655 --> 02:42:21.656]  Louis radio, realized by you guys now.
[02:42:21.656 --> 02:42:26.617]  So just congratulations on that, and Godspeed to you guys at The Gateway Pundit.
[02:42:26.617 --> 02:42:27.958]  Thanks so much, Owen.
[02:42:27.958 --> 02:42:30.399]  I'll let my brother Joe, he does a morning show up here.
[02:42:30.399 --> 02:42:32.699]  I'll let him know I have you on soon.
[02:42:32.699 --> 02:42:34.120]  That would be fantastic.
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:34.500]  All right.
[02:42:35.706 --> 02:42:41.912]  Jim Hough from the Gateway Pundit, the intrepid Gateway Pundit, leaves us now.
[02:42:41.912 --> 02:42:54.245]  All right, when we come back, I'm going to do a news blitz with the rest of the stories I have here and a couple video clips, and then Kate Daly has the fourth hour ahead of the war room.
[02:42:56.934 --> 02:43:04.409]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[02:43:04.409 --> 02:43:08.537]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports put out by NASA and other governments and other agencies,
[02:43:09.574 --> 02:43:12.276]  They all disagree on what's really happening with climate.
[02:43:12.276 --> 02:43:17.821]  The only concept, the only great truth is, change is the only concept.
[02:43:17.821 --> 02:43:20.583]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[02:43:20.583 --> 02:43:27.469]  But notice, first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's gonna be global warming, and that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:29.511]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[02:43:29.511 --> 02:43:31.512]  But did you know that man-made climate change
[02:43:32.313 --> 02:43:38.895]  is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN.
[02:43:38.895 --> 02:43:45.318]  They have weather control treaties from 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[02:43:45.318 --> 02:43:52.640]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:54.381]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:57.221]  I got some good news.
[02:43:57.221 --> 02:44:03.423]  All the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50% off at InfoWarshaw.com.
[02:44:03.423 --> 02:44:06.744]  The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out.
[02:44:06.744 --> 02:44:10.405]  So this sale is only going from one week starting on September 29th.
[02:44:10.405 --> 02:44:12.406]  And in the case of green fiber capsules,
[02:44:13.326 --> 02:44:15.668]  These will be sold out in just a couple days.
[02:44:15.668 --> 02:44:16.829]  50% off.
[02:44:16.829 --> 02:44:18.511]  We have Knockout Sleep Aid.
[02:44:18.511 --> 02:44:19.111]  50% off.
[02:44:19.111 --> 02:44:20.312]  Sold out for months.
[02:44:20.312 --> 02:44:21.273]  Very popular.
[02:44:21.273 --> 02:44:22.855]  Twice as strong as Knockout.
[02:44:22.855 --> 02:44:24.316]  Probably too strong for some people.
[02:44:24.316 --> 02:44:25.777]  Totally different formula.
[02:44:25.777 --> 02:44:26.998]  Down and Out is back in stock.
[02:44:26.998 --> 02:44:28.059]  50% off.
[02:44:28.059 --> 02:44:31.422]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12.
[02:44:31.422 --> 02:44:32.023]  50% off.
[02:44:32.023 --> 02:44:34.986]  And also on Deep Earth Crystal Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:44:35.546 --> 02:44:36.567]  It's a win-win.
[02:44:36.567 --> 02:44:40.831]  These are things that make you healthy, make your life better, and they fund the InfoWar.
[02:44:40.831 --> 02:44:43.534]  Again, the only way we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[02:44:56.843 --> 02:45:03.267]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[02:45:03.267 --> 02:45:10.651]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[02:45:10.651 --> 02:45:16.995]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions.
[02:45:17.495 --> 02:45:20.657]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[02:45:20.657 --> 02:45:23.400]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:27.002]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[02:45:27.002 --> 02:45:29.544]  Also described as the seat of the soul.
[02:45:29.544 --> 02:45:33.187]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness.
[02:45:33.767 --> 02:45:37.069]  And otherwise, unseen dimensions of reality.
[02:45:37.069 --> 02:45:42.051]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[02:45:42.051 --> 02:45:48.294]  Our water filtration systems, with the proper filters, will keep your drinking water fluoride-free.
[02:45:48.294 --> 02:45:51.155]  And the Pro-Pure showerhead will seal the deal.
[02:45:51.155 --> 02:45:55.957]  Get them both today, for yourself or a friend, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:45:58.288 --> 02:46:02.673]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[02:46:02.673 --> 02:46:10.981]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[02:46:10.981 --> 02:46:14.505]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[02:46:14.505 --> 02:46:18.549]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors.
[02:46:19.310 --> 02:46:23.891]  For the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[02:46:23.891 --> 02:46:32.034]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[02:46:32.034 --> 02:46:42.197]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[02:46:42.197 --> 02:46:44.958]  You will then be my slaves.
[02:46:44.958 --> 02:46:45.098]  Own.
[02:46:45.738 --> 02:46:49.761]  And then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[02:46:49.761 --> 02:46:59.948]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[02:46:59.948 --> 02:47:02.589]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:12.645 --> 02:47:15.147]  Alright, there is just so much developing right now.
[02:47:15.147 --> 02:47:17.189]  It's just crazy.
[02:47:17.189 --> 02:47:27.618]  You've got a bill that just passed in Congress to have unlimited numbers of entries from Afghanistan.
[02:47:27.618 --> 02:47:29.359]  So, but Petit, it's all about bringing in...
[02:47:31.701 --> 02:47:41.485]  Unvetted refugees that have no prospects here to suck off the welfare system, not bringing in the Americans or the green card holders or the allies that are actually being attacked in Afghanistan right now.
[02:47:41.485 --> 02:47:42.845]  So that's going on.
[02:47:42.845 --> 02:47:47.567]  YouTube has just removed Ron Paul's Institute channel!
[02:47:47.567 --> 02:47:50.348]  Just completely removed it!
[02:47:50.348 --> 02:47:54.850]  But they care about free speech, so they say.
[02:47:54.850 --> 02:47:59.112]  Let me just get through the rest of the news and video clips I haven't covered here today.
[02:48:00.383 --> 02:48:03.744]  Before I hand the baton over to Kate Dally.
[02:48:03.744 --> 02:48:07.425]  Military units track guns using tech.
[02:48:07.425 --> 02:48:08.605]  And it's a story out of the AP.
[02:48:08.605 --> 02:48:13.506]  Basically, you know, smart guns that are going to have RFID chips in them so that they can track all the guns.
[02:48:13.506 --> 02:48:14.446]  And that's the future they want.
[02:48:14.446 --> 02:48:18.507]  If they can't confiscate them, I guess they'd at least rather track them.
[02:48:18.507 --> 02:48:19.227]  So that's nice.
[02:48:19.227 --> 02:48:21.047]  And they'll act like, oh, it's for the military.
[02:48:21.047 --> 02:48:21.827]  It's for this purpose.
[02:48:21.827 --> 02:48:28.829]  No, it's for the smart grid, the Internet of Things, so that if you have a gun, if you're a gun owner, you can be targeted very easily.
[02:48:30.388 --> 02:48:31.969]  We all know that.
[02:48:31.969 --> 02:48:37.231]  The New York Times wants to redesign the American flag.
[02:48:37.231 --> 02:48:39.052]  Yes, that's right.
[02:48:39.052 --> 02:48:44.614]  Redesigning America's flag is the headline at the New York Times.
[02:48:44.614 --> 02:48:48.156]  They have all these different examples of the new flag that they want to have.
[02:48:48.156 --> 02:48:52.578]  It's all about attacking America, destroying America.
[02:48:53.837 --> 02:48:55.118]  Because, you know, America's bad.
[02:48:55.118 --> 02:49:05.506]  Everybody wants to come here and it's created the most prosperity and upward mobility in the world and we do more for other countries and foreign aid and refugees than any other country on earth combined.
[02:49:05.506 --> 02:49:07.467]  But we're the bad guys.
[02:49:07.467 --> 02:49:07.968]  Apparently.
[02:49:07.968 --> 02:49:09.529]  Somehow.
[02:49:09.529 --> 02:49:12.471]  But that's just what you get from the left.
[02:49:15.425 --> 02:49:18.147]  And some news of the insane here.
[02:49:18.147 --> 02:49:21.110]  These are both kind of funny in their own way.
[02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:27.135]  New York City garbage truck drags dining shed 10 feet with patrons inside.
[02:49:27.135 --> 02:49:33.680]  So if you haven't been to New York City recently, it's sad to admit, but it's basically just a dump.
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:39.445]  And with all the scaffolding and the trash on the streets and now all these weird outdoor dining facilities, it's just a mess.
[02:49:40.822 --> 02:49:43.123]  New York City is.
[02:49:43.123 --> 02:49:45.704]  So now they're dragging patrons trying to eat dinner.
[02:49:45.704 --> 02:49:51.326]  Folks, literally, I'm telling you, the streets of New York are just disgusting.
[02:49:51.326 --> 02:49:54.227]  Anywhere you go, you're going to see mountains of trash.
[02:49:54.227 --> 02:49:57.229]  Everywhere you walk on the streets, covered in scaffolding.
[02:49:57.229 --> 02:50:02.851]  Now you have all these outdoor dining things set up because you can't eat inside.
[02:50:02.851 --> 02:50:04.772]  There's also protests happening all the time.
[02:50:04.772 --> 02:50:07.953]  In fact, let's real quickly go to a video of that.
[02:50:09.201 --> 02:50:17.748]  Let's go to, guys, Roll Clip 17, a Manhattan restaurant who forces you to show a vaccine pass to eat.
[02:50:17.748 --> 02:50:19.369]  It didn't go so well for them recently.
[02:50:19.369 --> 02:50:22.931]  Here it is.
[02:50:22.931 --> 02:50:33.439]  Okay, so it went on.
[02:50:33.439 --> 02:50:34.660]  The cops showed up.
[02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:35.941]  They couldn't escort them out.
[02:50:35.941 --> 02:50:37.703]  They then started chaining back the blue.
[02:50:39.469 --> 02:50:46.673]  And so this is just, now look, I wouldn't want to go to a restaurant that has a vaccine mandate anyway.
[02:50:46.673 --> 02:50:53.597]  So that's just a battle that I wouldn't be involved with, but the people are resisting the COVID tyranny any which way they can.
[02:50:53.597 --> 02:50:58.861]  We also have the videos of the police basically refusing to escort them out, and then the crowd chants back the blue.
[02:50:58.861 --> 02:51:03.183]  That's the kinship we need with law enforcement right now.
[02:51:03.183 --> 02:51:04.484]  Here's another funny one for you.
[02:51:07.895 --> 02:51:09.937]  This like needs to be a movie out of this.
[02:51:09.937 --> 02:51:16.665]  Drunk man spends hours helping search for missing person before realizing they were looking for him!
[02:51:18.123 --> 02:51:25.889]  Drunk Turkish man spends hours helping search party hunting for missing persons without realizing he's the missing person they're searching for.
[02:51:25.889 --> 02:51:30.692]  Bayan Mutlu was drinking with friends when he wandered into the woods.
[02:51:30.692 --> 02:51:40.740]  He was reported as missing, stumbled across the search party searching for himself, joined the search party searching for himself, until they all figured out that he's the one they're searching for.
[02:51:41.707 --> 02:51:43.688]  Are we having fun yet?
[02:51:43.688 --> 02:51:44.929]  Are we having fun yet?
[02:51:44.929 --> 02:51:49.833]  They're having fun in Turkey with the missing man searching for himself.
[02:51:49.833 --> 02:51:59.319]  And they're having fun in New York City eating in an outside shed for the unvaxed masses and then getting drug off by a garbage truck.
[02:51:59.319 --> 02:52:00.940]  So we're having fun.
[02:52:00.940 --> 02:52:02.742]  We're all having a good time.
[02:52:02.742 --> 02:52:05.444]  Silicon Valley is basically admitting they're trying to create God.
[02:52:08.456 --> 02:52:15.001]  Mr. Goudat is the Silicon Valley super-geek who believes we face an apocalyptic threat from an artificial intelligence.
[02:52:15.001 --> 02:52:22.626]  The former Google super-mo tells Hugo Rothkind how a human tragedy shaped the way he sees the future and what we need to do next.
[02:52:22.626 --> 02:52:29.131]  And yeah, it's all about they're creating this AI and who knows, you know, will it become sentient or will it just make decisions for itself?
[02:52:29.131 --> 02:52:30.011]  Will it launch nukes?
[02:52:30.011 --> 02:52:31.893]  Will it purge the planet?
[02:52:31.893 --> 02:52:33.113]  How much power are they giving it?
[02:52:33.113 --> 02:52:36.236]  How much range do they have on it?
[02:52:36.236 --> 02:52:37.496]  That's just Silicon Valley though.
[02:52:38.930 --> 02:52:40.171]  You know, they're fine.
[02:52:40.171 --> 02:52:41.872]  They love you so much.
[02:52:41.872 --> 02:52:47.076]  Let's go to Marjorie Taylor Greene in clip one.
[02:52:47.076 --> 02:52:57.022]  She had an event in Georgia, and boy, Marjorie Taylor Greene is really just taking the reins off, if you will, and no censorship.
[02:52:57.022 --> 02:52:59.344]  She's not even censoring herself here.
[02:52:59.344 --> 02:53:00.484]  I think that it's a good thing.
[02:53:00.484 --> 02:53:00.905]  Hey, you know what?
[02:53:00.905 --> 02:53:02.606]  Politics can get nasty.
[02:53:03.286 --> 02:53:09.349]  And so, for so long and so far, the Democrats have been the only ones that take low blows and play nasty.
[02:53:09.349 --> 02:53:10.990]  Marjorie Taylor Greene ain't having it anymore.
[02:53:10.990 --> 02:53:16.172]  Here she was at an event in Georgia where she had a few words for Nancy Pelosi.
[02:53:16.172 --> 02:53:26.077]  I just want to say to Nancy Pelosi, she's a hypocrite, she's an anti-American, and we're going to kick that bitch out of Congress.
[02:53:26.077 --> 02:53:27.658]  Say it louder for the people in the back.
[02:53:32.512 --> 02:53:38.414]  And the raucous applause.
[02:53:38.414 --> 02:53:43.575]  And you watch, her campaign donations are just going to skyrocket.
[02:53:43.575 --> 02:53:49.176]  Because Republicans and conservatives and American patriots are sick of being bullied and pushed around by the left.
[02:53:49.176 --> 02:53:55.958]  And it's nice to see someone push back, even if it is a little uncouth, if you will.
[02:53:55.958 --> 02:53:58.779]  I think it's perfectly fair, considering everything the Democrats are doing to us.
[02:54:00.219 --> 02:54:04.363]  Here's a video out of Europe, guys, in clip 2.
[02:54:04.363 --> 02:54:05.684]  This is all by design.
[02:54:05.684 --> 02:54:08.928]  This is the end of civilization as you know it, into the new.
[02:54:08.928 --> 02:54:13.552]  The COVID tyranny is just the introduction, just the primer for the climate tyranny.
[02:54:13.552 --> 02:54:19.919]  Here's what it's going to look like, just a taste of what the climate tyranny is going to look like from the UK in clip 2.
[02:54:21.064 --> 02:54:23.105]  We warned of all the food shortages.
[02:54:23.105 --> 02:54:25.467]  We warned of all the fuel shortages.
[02:54:25.467 --> 02:54:27.568]  We warned of everything.
[02:54:27.568 --> 02:54:29.789]  Now there's no fuel in the UK.
[02:54:29.789 --> 02:54:33.511]  They are systematically inflating everything.
[02:54:33.511 --> 02:54:36.373]  This is a war against humanity.
[02:54:36.373 --> 02:54:37.674]  This is deliberate.
[02:54:37.674 --> 02:54:41.316]  This is from your governments, and they are attacking us.
[02:54:41.316 --> 02:54:42.757]  See, people just need to understand.
[02:54:44.710 --> 02:54:50.071]  The world elite that believe they run and own this planet have decided there's no more use for you.
[02:54:50.071 --> 02:54:55.212]  You're being priced out, you're being squeezed out, you're being forced out of existence.
[02:54:55.212 --> 02:54:56.512]  That's been the determination.
[02:54:56.512 --> 02:55:07.774]  And again, I explained at the top of the show, they believe that they've had the awakening, they have the science, that there's X amount of resources on the world that give the humans X amount of time to live this lifestyle.
[02:55:07.774 --> 02:55:10.795]  There's too many humans, the humans need to be called, it's the only way to save humanity.
[02:55:11.957 --> 02:55:15.518]  That's what the world elite have decided, and so they've just decided you're useless now.
[02:55:15.518 --> 02:55:19.200]  They won't just open up and say it to your face in so many words and be honest.
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:22.941]  They'll kind of hint at it and throw it out there in their own nuanced ways.
[02:55:22.941 --> 02:55:25.022]  But no, that is the case.
[02:55:25.022 --> 02:55:26.482]  Absolutely.
[02:55:26.482 --> 02:55:29.464]  More protests are happening in New York City.
[02:55:29.464 --> 02:55:33.025]  Here was a scene from a... I mean, it's every night with this now.
[02:55:33.025 --> 02:55:35.846]  Here's another scene from another protest in New York City last night.
[02:55:40.182 --> 02:55:42.066]  Hold on guys, my bad.
[02:55:42.066 --> 02:55:42.687]  Play clip six.
[02:55:55.031 --> 02:55:59.654]  So, it's just thousands of people in the streets every night in New York.
[02:55:59.654 --> 02:56:08.359]  And the alliance of Black Lives Matter and Trump supporters is becoming a real thing now, too, against the vaccine mandates.
[02:56:08.359 --> 02:56:10.040]  All right, I want to play clip four real quick.
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:19.545]  Here's Kamala Harris visiting a school, and a student who's obviously brainwashed by the liberal media says something, and then what Kamala Harris says after that is really telling.
[02:56:19.545 --> 02:56:20.226]  Here it is, clip four.
[02:56:21.016 --> 02:56:41.405]  I see that over the summer, there have been protests and demonstrations and astronomical numbers, but then just a few days ago, there were funds allocated to continue backing Israel, which hurts my heart because it's an ethnic genocide and it just puts my people the same that happened in America, and I'm sure you're aware of this.
[02:56:41.405 --> 02:56:43.386]  So she says it's an ethnic genocide.
[02:56:43.386 --> 02:56:47.608]  Israel is running an ethnic genocide in the Middle East, this student claims.
[02:56:48.797 --> 02:56:51.198]  And listen to Harris' response.
[02:56:51.198 --> 02:56:55.160]  George Mason University, avoid it at all costs.
[02:56:55.160 --> 02:57:10.487]  And notice that Harris wears a mask when she's amongst the peasants to pretend like she's one of you.
[02:57:10.487 --> 02:57:12.587]  Because she makes you wear a mask, you're a good peasant.
[02:57:16.511 --> 02:57:17.212]  I'm glad you did.
[02:57:17.212 --> 02:57:24.037]  And again, this is about the fact that your voice, your perspective, your experience, your truth... There it is right there.
[02:57:24.037 --> 02:57:24.417]  Do you hear that?
[02:57:24.417 --> 02:57:25.758]  Your truth.
[02:57:25.758 --> 02:57:27.499]  Your truth.
[02:57:27.499 --> 02:57:28.199]  Your truth.
[02:57:28.199 --> 02:57:29.721]  It doesn't matter if it's wrong.
[02:57:29.721 --> 02:57:31.502]  It doesn't matter that it's made up.
[02:57:31.502 --> 02:57:32.923]  It doesn't matter if it's fantasy land.
[02:57:32.923 --> 02:57:34.964]  It's your truth.
[02:57:34.964 --> 02:57:41.449]  Is this part of Kamala Harris' crisis of rebranding herself because she's so unpopular and a total phony?
[02:57:41.449 --> 02:57:45.312]  Hanging out with the peasants, saying, your truth, even if it's a lie, but it's your truth.
[02:57:47.349 --> 02:57:58.733]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the New World Order and Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well.
[02:57:58.733 --> 02:58:02.655]  That means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government.
[02:58:03.235 --> 02:58:17.466]  Established by the Rockefellers through the UN, and they want inside your bodies to put in you what they want, when they want, and to have the global digital tracking COVID passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone of their new world ID.
[02:58:18.547 --> 02:58:27.429]  And now their puppet, Biden, has announced the forced inoculation of 100 million Americans to keep their jobs, in total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[02:58:27.429 --> 02:58:28.750]  This is criminal.
[02:58:28.750 --> 02:58:32.070]  And he's lying, saying it's an approved vaccine, when they did not approve it.
[02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:34.491]  They say that's a 2025 maybe.
[02:58:34.491 --> 02:58:36.932]  They just expanded the emergency authorization.
[02:58:36.932 --> 02:58:39.993]  That's why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago.
[02:58:39.993 --> 02:58:41.193]  Well, you live to see it.
[02:58:41.193 --> 02:58:43.473]  Absolute New World Order world government.
[02:58:43.473 --> 02:58:45.454]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[02:58:47.028 --> 02:58:49.669]  My business model is very, very simple.
[02:58:49.669 --> 02:59:07.037]  I want to bring you products that work really, really well at affordable prices that are competitive so that you'll shop with us and so we form a relationship so we're able to stay on air and fight the globalists and have good products that make us healthy, make us wiser, that boost our immune system.
[02:59:07.037 --> 02:59:07.777]  And that's what we've done.
[02:59:08.157 --> 02:59:12.240]  Now one area of the immune system we don't talk enough about is deep restful sleep.
[02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:13.521]  Look it up for yourself.
[02:59:13.521 --> 02:59:16.603]  The effects of deep restful sleep on health and the immune system.
[02:59:16.603 --> 02:59:21.887]  And so with everything we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D and zinc and all of it, that's great.
[02:59:21.887 --> 02:59:25.090]  But deep restful sleep is just as important, maybe more important,
[02:59:25.530 --> 02:59:34.097]  So, InfoWarsTore.com now can announce 50% off on our best-selling product, Down and Out, that just came back in after four months being sold out.
[02:59:34.097 --> 02:59:37.340]  It's 50% off, it's super strong, so be careful with it.
[02:59:37.340 --> 02:59:40.122]  If you want deep, restful sleep, this will do it.
[02:59:40.122 --> 02:59:41.123]  Everybody loves it.
[02:59:41.123 --> 02:59:42.324]  Five stars.
[02:59:42.324 --> 02:59:49.350]  InfoWarsTore.com, Down and Out, now back in stock, 50% off.
[02:59:49.350 --> 02:59:52.012]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:08.166 --> 03:00:11.847]  All right, final segment for me, and then Kate Dally takes over.
[03:00:11.847 --> 03:00:18.809]  By the way, there was an 18-year-old mom who got shot by police in the head.
[03:00:18.809 --> 03:00:21.850]  She's now brain dead, but you won't be hearing about her story.
[03:00:21.850 --> 03:00:22.870]  She was unarmed.
[03:00:22.870 --> 03:00:24.431]  You won't be hearing about her story.
[03:00:24.431 --> 03:00:27.252]  I bet you can guess why.
[03:00:27.252 --> 03:00:32.493]  Now, here's Burgess Owens, a great member of Congress, one of the few great Americans we have in Congress.
[03:00:32.493 --> 03:00:33.654]  He is, of course, a Republican.
[03:00:34.591 --> 03:00:39.395]  He just gave this speech on the floor of Congress today, and it really angered Democrats.
[03:00:39.395 --> 03:00:44.078]  You can hear them squealing and screeching as he delivers his speech to Congress.
[03:00:44.078 --> 03:00:44.619]  Here it was.
[03:00:44.619 --> 03:00:50.263]  I'd like to address comments made by my friend from Georgia on the other side.
[03:00:50.263 --> 03:00:54.506]  I think we're going to ever get to resolving the issues we have in the black community.
[03:00:54.506 --> 03:00:56.528]  We've got to be honest with friends.
[03:00:56.528 --> 03:01:00.531]  We just heard that a pushback on the fact
[03:01:01.069 --> 03:01:03.891]  That we're getting black men in the black community not doing their job.
[03:01:03.891 --> 03:01:05.872]  Well, let me give you the facts real quick.
[03:01:05.872 --> 03:01:13.096]  First of all, when I was growing up in the 60s, we led the country and men committed to marriage over 70%.
[03:01:13.096 --> 03:01:19.880]  Black women could rely on getting married more than white women until 1970.
[03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:24.743]  We now have between 70 to 80% of black fathers who desert their families.
[03:01:24.743 --> 03:01:26.364]  And we're not willing to be honest about that.
[03:01:28.476 --> 03:01:31.957]  We're not willing to say that these guys need to man up.
[03:01:31.957 --> 03:01:43.540]  Maybe when we start telling our kids that they're being nothing but whiners, wheezes, and wimps if men cannot take care of their own kids, that might be a good start.
[03:01:43.540 --> 03:01:45.760]  I reject the words of this gentleman.
[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:47.841]  Mr. Chairman, I call for order.
[03:01:47.841 --> 03:01:48.921]  I call for order.
[03:01:48.921 --> 03:01:50.562]  We right now, the facts are in.
[03:01:50.562 --> 03:01:52.402]  Mr. Big says the time.
[03:01:52.402 --> 03:01:53.882]  The facts are in.
[03:01:53.882 --> 03:01:55.103]  Facts.
[03:01:55.103 --> 03:01:55.983]  Black fathers.
[03:01:57.102 --> 03:01:58.884]  70 to 80 percent are deserting their families.
[03:01:58.884 --> 03:02:02.167]  Talk to these black single women out there and see what they think about this.
[03:02:02.167 --> 03:02:11.258]  We're sitting in this little bubble where we're living a life, we're married, many of us, and we cannot be honest about what's happening in our urban communities.
[03:02:12.193 --> 03:02:14.755]  Well, these kids are growing up with no fathers, no example.
[03:02:14.755 --> 03:02:23.583]  At the end of the day, there's a reason why our kids are being led toward these options of hopelessness.
[03:02:23.583 --> 03:02:28.568]  And for us to sit here in 2021, not right now, because I'm sorry, let me just finish.
[03:02:28.568 --> 03:02:34.693]  To sit here in 2021 and not point out the fact that we have fatherless homes.
[03:02:34.693 --> 03:02:36.335]  We have 70 to 80 percent.
[03:02:36.335 --> 03:02:37.556]  These are the facts, my friends.
[03:02:38.746 --> 03:02:48.991]  70-80% will not marry the mothers of their children and instead would probably try to convince them to dissolve them from their issues to go and get an abortion.
[03:02:48.991 --> 03:02:52.953]  We've lost 20 million black babies over the last 40 years.
[03:02:52.953 --> 03:02:57.615]  40% of my race has been exterminated because we don't have men.
[03:02:58.677 --> 03:02:58.737]  The
[03:03:22.523 --> 03:03:24.103]  What changes this trajectory?
[03:03:24.103 --> 03:03:25.544]  We're sick and tired.
[03:03:25.544 --> 03:03:32.085]  I was looking, people looking at us as this is a normal thing that we just don't do our job as men.
[03:03:32.085 --> 03:03:33.085]  Be aware.
[03:03:33.085 --> 03:03:34.766]  We're waking up.
[03:03:34.766 --> 03:03:41.987]  And that's going to be a change in the coming years that we're going to start seeing black men really commit to their families, their kids, the mothers of children.
[03:03:41.987 --> 03:03:45.308]  And being productive Americans we were back when I was growing up.
[03:03:45.308 --> 03:03:48.789]  Well, Democrats don't want to see that because then they won't vote Democrat.
[03:03:50.196 --> 03:03:52.879]  Then they might vote Republican!
[03:03:52.879 --> 03:04:00.947]  So you can hear the Democrats trying to shut down a black man from speaking there on Congress, coughing into the microphone, oh I reject, I reject!
[03:04:00.947 --> 03:04:09.497]  So it's the Democrats, they tried to stop black men from being free during the Jim Crow era, during the Civil War, and they're still at it to this day.
[03:04:10.598 --> 03:04:13.061]  Really just amazing, but they claim they're the ones fighting racism.
[03:04:13.061 --> 03:04:14.382]  It's all just a front.
[03:04:14.382 --> 03:04:15.383]  It's all just posturing.
[03:04:15.383 --> 03:04:19.767]  All right, I'm handing the microphone over to Kate Daly.
[03:04:19.767 --> 03:04:22.350]  She'll be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the War Room.
[03:04:22.350 --> 03:04:24.472]  Ladies and gentlemen, remember InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:04:57.042 --> 03:05:02.446]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered?
[03:05:02.446 --> 03:05:04.487]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store?
[03:05:04.487 --> 03:05:06.208]  Do you think they would let you in?
[03:05:06.208 --> 03:05:10.851]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting?
[03:05:10.851 --> 03:05:19.157]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on?
[03:05:19.157 --> 03:05:20.778]  How far do you think that would get you?
[03:05:20.778 --> 03:05:25.341]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space
[03:05:26.121 --> 03:05:27.022]  Alien?
[03:05:27.022 --> 03:05:34.146]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[03:05:34.146 --> 03:05:37.809]  The globalists are running a psychological war for operational humanity.
[03:05:37.809 --> 03:05:40.591]  Only waking up to the Great Reset and its tyranny will save us.
[03:05:41.371 --> 03:05:43.673]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[03:05:43.673 --> 03:05:49.657]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud, and that it's dangerous, and that it causes major medical issues, and it's dehumanizing.
[03:05:49.657 --> 03:05:51.219]  And the film COVIDland does that.

[03:06:07.782 --> 03:06:08.663]  Hi, everybody.
[03:06:08.663 --> 03:06:13.606]  Kate Daly, your guest host today, and what a terrific show, my gosh!
[03:06:13.606 --> 03:06:20.811]  Well, I have a wonderful guest for you, so I'm really hoping you're going to stay on and listen to this, because this is really pertinent information.
[03:06:20.811 --> 03:06:23.633]  Greg Manorino, the Robin Hood of Wall Street.
[03:06:23.633 --> 03:06:31.298]  I think it's been too long since I've had you on, Greg, and I'm really excited to be able to talk about the financial markets, where we're headed, and
[03:06:31.758 --> 03:06:33.820]  Really, the backdrop of what's going on.
[03:06:33.820 --> 03:06:42.326]  You are, to me, the guru, the guy, the one that usually always calls the shots and you know what you're doing, so I'm really happy to have you on.
[03:06:42.326 --> 03:06:46.830]  And TradersChoice.net, if you don't know that site, well, you should.
[03:06:46.830 --> 03:06:47.790]  What can I say?
[03:06:47.790 --> 03:06:49.852]  Greg's been a guest on my show.
[03:06:49.852 --> 03:06:53.855]  He's also been on Alex's show, too, and for a good reason.
[03:06:53.855 --> 03:06:55.036]  Greg Manorino, welcome.
[03:06:56.440 --> 03:06:57.121]  Thanks for having me.
[03:06:57.121 --> 03:06:58.122]  It's been a long time.
[03:06:58.122 --> 03:06:59.002]  Great to see you.
[03:06:59.002 --> 03:07:02.866]  Actually, it's been like a really long time, but I'm happy to be here, really.
[03:07:02.866 --> 03:07:04.487]  There's so much going on.
[03:07:04.487 --> 03:07:07.150]  It's so freaking twisted and sick.
[03:07:07.150 --> 03:07:14.276]  Watching the last segment and, you know, I just sometimes I want to scream.
[03:07:14.276 --> 03:07:17.619]  I literally want to stick my head out this window and scream.
[03:07:17.619 --> 03:07:21.703]  And I think that a lot of people are getting, you know, that same kind of feeling.
[03:07:21.703 --> 03:07:22.404]  It's out of control.
[03:07:23.144 --> 03:07:34.370]  And I think it's all being done, honestly, to keep people in some kind of state of helplessness, learned helplessness, feeling like they can't do anything.
[03:07:34.370 --> 03:07:38.732]  This is a very unique environment in many, many ways.
[03:07:38.732 --> 03:07:43.014]  And I'm glad people are starting to pay freaking attention to this.
[03:07:43.014 --> 03:07:46.196]  And some people are just not going to get it, no matter what they hear.
[03:07:47.097 --> 03:07:47.397]  I think?
[03:08:01.493 --> 03:08:02.073]  Thank you so much.
[03:08:28.461 --> 03:08:31.605]  My blog and my work and it's not just the financial markets.
[03:08:31.605 --> 03:08:42.280]  It's really how this whole freak show plays together And I just want people to understand they are really living in interesting times, and if we don't do something We're just done
[03:08:43.604 --> 03:08:49.667]  Well, my gosh, to me, OK, one of the first questions I have for you, Greg, is what is hitting you right off the bat?
[03:08:49.667 --> 03:08:52.409]  What is so obvious that you can't ignore right now?
[03:08:52.409 --> 03:08:56.171]  And I know there's multiple signs right now that we have never seen before.
[03:08:56.171 --> 03:09:02.815]  But what are some of those triggered events that you just you are just thinking, oh, my gosh, why are people not seeing what's happening with this market?
[03:09:04.631 --> 03:09:08.018]  Well, you know, the market and everything is just kind of ties together.
[03:09:08.018 --> 03:09:14.231]  I mean, you know, on a deeper level here, we were seeing the elimination of free thought.
[03:09:15.049 --> 03:09:18.291]  Free action and free movement, like I just started off with earlier.
[03:09:18.291 --> 03:09:31.621]  And, you know, look, the market is an entity among itself here, and it's being absolutely pulled in any direction that, you know, the big players want it to go.
[03:09:31.621 --> 03:09:33.543]  I'm just trading the fake market.
[03:09:33.543 --> 03:09:34.543]  It's not real.
[03:09:34.543 --> 03:09:35.784]  There's no price action.
[03:09:35.784 --> 03:09:39.287]  There's no price discovery behind any asset anymore.
[03:09:39.887 --> 03:09:43.690]  It's so out of control that it's really hard to get your head around.
[03:09:43.690 --> 03:09:51.496]  And I study this thing 24-7 and that's why I'm maybe kind of, you know, losing my mind a little bit here.
[03:09:51.496 --> 03:09:56.340]  But the fact of the matter is, what's hitting me with regards to the market, I mean, we're in a hyper bubble.
[03:09:56.340 --> 03:09:59.042]  It's super out of control.
[03:09:59.042 --> 03:10:01.243]  And that's okay because it does present opportunity.
[03:10:01.243 --> 03:10:04.146]  And that's really what I try to do with my work is cut through it all.
[03:10:04.146 --> 03:10:05.547]  What can we all do?
[03:10:06.707 --> 03:10:07.968]  Thank you so much for having me.
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:32.261]  A new government philosophy.
[03:10:32.261 --> 03:10:38.424]  Governments which, this government, whatever, has now merged with the corporate agenda here.
[03:10:38.424 --> 03:10:40.585]  The definition of this is fascism.
[03:10:40.585 --> 03:10:41.965]  We all know that.
[03:10:41.965 --> 03:10:44.446]  And that's bleeding across the markets too.
[03:10:44.446 --> 03:10:50.749]  Creating an extreme two-tier society, a new feudal system, a new indoctrination.
[03:10:50.749 --> 03:10:53.830]  It's absolutely out of control.
[03:10:53.830 --> 03:10:57.132]  And yeah, that's what it gets to me is I'm watching so many people
[03:10:57.732 --> 03:11:01.335]  Friends of mine, some of them very close friends, are buying this.
[03:11:01.335 --> 03:11:09.180]  They're buying into what's going on, the narrative, the mainstream garbage, you know, the divide and conquer mechanism.
[03:11:09.180 --> 03:11:10.200]  They don't see it.
[03:11:10.200 --> 03:11:12.822]  They don't understand that they're being manipulated.
[03:11:12.822 --> 03:11:17.585]  It's always how it's been, but never to this degree before.
[03:11:17.585 --> 03:11:19.226]  And it is, it's troubling.
[03:11:19.226 --> 03:11:20.227]  There's just no doubt about it.
[03:11:21.923 --> 03:11:31.246]  One thing people love about you, Greg, is your ability at TradersChoice.net to really lay it on the line and tell people what you're doing personally and what they can do to safeguard.
[03:11:31.246 --> 03:11:37.047]  So there's a lot of people with a lot of money out there on Wall Street trying to decide what to do with it.
[03:11:37.047 --> 03:11:37.827]  Do I take it out?
[03:11:37.827 --> 03:11:39.628]  Do I put it in gold and silver right now?
[03:11:39.628 --> 03:11:46.129]  Are we seeing so many signs that are so ominous that it's time?
[03:11:46.129 --> 03:11:48.270]  And I also want to get your thoughts on the crypto market too.
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:50.100]  Sure.
[03:11:50.100 --> 03:11:51.981]  Well, let's start off with this.
[03:11:51.981 --> 03:12:04.968]  Despite the narrative from the dog shit fake propaganda ministry, the mainstream outlets here, our economy is contracting at its fastest pace in history as a percentage of GDP.
[03:12:04.968 --> 03:12:06.509]  We have never seen this before.
[03:12:07.790 --> 03:12:10.391]  It's rapid and it's crumbling around us.
[03:12:10.391 --> 03:12:18.156]  I mean, just like today, for example, we just found out that another 362,000 people applied for first-time unemployment benefits last week.
[03:12:18.156 --> 03:12:20.237]  It's the same story every single week.
[03:12:20.237 --> 03:12:23.339]  The bad economic news does not stop.
[03:12:23.339 --> 03:12:27.422]  Debts and deficits are hyper-exploding all by design here.
[03:12:27.882 --> 03:12:33.608]  But again, the propaganda ministry is trying to tell people everything is doing just fantastic and it's perfect and it's beautiful.
[03:12:33.608 --> 03:12:34.930]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[03:12:34.930 --> 03:12:43.159]  This has been going on for quite a long time and it's all in an effort to bring about a new society, a new mentality.
[03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:49.281]  You know, extreme haves, extreme have-nots, and that's just the way it's going to play out here.
[03:12:49.281 --> 03:12:57.043]  You know, this is how the few have controlled the many for thousands of years, this kind of a mechanism that we're seeing right now, but never on such a grand scale.
[03:12:57.043 --> 03:12:59.263]  It's so bad today.
[03:12:59.263 --> 03:13:05.805]  I mean, I've been telling people this is the golden age for people that are well off and rich, and everyone else is getting squashed.
[03:13:05.805 --> 03:13:10.826]  This is a grand elimination, and I mean this, an extermination of the middle class.
[03:13:11.600 --> 03:13:26.735]  And we're moving definitely into a new mode of thinking here, and people are being programmed by the millions to fall into this new government system.
[03:13:26.735 --> 03:13:30.959]  And it's very frightening to me, it really is.
[03:13:30.959 --> 03:13:32.661]  What was the second part of the question you asked?
[03:13:33.368 --> 03:13:36.871]  China, crypto, because a lot of people have questions about crypto.
[03:13:36.871 --> 03:13:40.635]  We know they're trying to move us into a digital currency completely.
[03:13:40.635 --> 03:13:42.056]  Absolutely no cash.
[03:13:42.056 --> 03:13:43.697]  So what does that look like to you?
[03:13:43.697 --> 03:13:45.419]  And what was China's move about?
[03:13:45.419 --> 03:13:47.321]  I know we only have a couple minutes before the break.
[03:13:47.321 --> 03:13:48.302]  We'll hit this hard again.
[03:13:48.302 --> 03:13:51.845]  But what was China's big move about in making that illegal?
[03:13:52.853 --> 03:13:54.755]  Well, imagine my shock here.
[03:13:54.755 --> 03:13:59.720]  You have a communist nation trying to, you know, take something away from people.
[03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:05.886]  Here is something that would give people the opportunity to transact outside of a central bank system.
[03:14:05.886 --> 03:14:07.768]  You got to be kidding me.
[03:14:07.768 --> 03:14:10.931]  It's not going to make a difference to me in the long run, in my view.
[03:14:10.931 --> 03:14:13.333]  I am a major crypto bull.
[03:14:13.333 --> 03:14:14.294]  Everybody knows that.
[03:14:14.294 --> 03:14:15.535]  I own a lot of crypto.
[03:14:15.535 --> 03:14:16.196]  I own them all.
[03:14:16.196 --> 03:14:17.117]  All the big ones I own.
[03:14:18.017 --> 03:14:22.479]  And I will continue to hold these things that have no intention of getting rid of them no matter what happens.
[03:14:22.479 --> 03:14:29.022]  I think people in China who now cannot transact because it's illegal in cryptos in any way shape or form, we're going to find a way around it.
[03:14:29.022 --> 03:14:29.623]  They always do.
[03:14:29.623 --> 03:14:32.684]  Tell people they can't do something and they want to do it more.
[03:14:33.822 --> 03:14:45.850]  Yeah, we could go on and on about this whole thing here, but I don't want people to worry and with regard to the market here on my website TradersChoice.net, like you mentioned a few times, I created a new indicator.
[03:14:45.850 --> 03:14:50.854]  It's called the MMRI, Manorino Market Risk Indicator.
[03:14:50.854 --> 03:14:57.178]  You can go look at it and this tells people what they should be doing for the most part with regard to risk in this market.
[03:14:57.178 --> 03:14:58.659]  This just came out last week.
[03:14:58.659 --> 03:15:00.200]  It's 100% free.
[03:15:00.200 --> 03:15:01.961]  I want people to utilize this resource.
[03:15:01.961 --> 03:15:03.342]  All this stuff on my website is free.
[03:15:04.082 --> 03:15:08.165]  And again, I want people to pay it forward if you're benefiting from this information.
[03:15:08.165 --> 03:15:09.906]  But that's really, really it.
[03:15:09.906 --> 03:15:11.847]  The game is going to remain risk on.
[03:15:11.847 --> 03:15:13.688]  The stock markets are hyper bubble.
[03:15:13.688 --> 03:15:18.111]  You need to have some cryptocurrency in your portfolio, in my view.
[03:15:18.111 --> 03:15:19.872]  The space is not for everyone.
[03:15:19.872 --> 03:15:20.872]  That's the truth.
[03:15:20.872 --> 03:15:21.773]  But it is for me.
[03:15:21.773 --> 03:15:27.756]  And I think a lot of people want to be outside the freaking rigged system.
[03:15:27.756 --> 03:15:28.677]  And that's a way to do it.
[03:15:29.745 --> 03:15:30.385]  So true.
[03:15:30.385 --> 03:15:33.246]  My guest is Greg Manorino, the Robin Hood of Wall Street.
[03:15:33.246 --> 03:15:35.246]  The website is traderschoice.net.

[03:15:38.087 --> 03:15:48.149]  Greg and I will be right back to discuss what you need to do, what you can do to protect yourself, what's coming next, what does he perceive in the market, and what should you be aware of.
[03:15:48.149 --> 03:15:49.669]  So much good information today.
[03:15:49.669 --> 03:15:51.630]  I really hope you're hanging on for this.
[03:15:51.630 --> 03:15:52.130]  Be right back.
[03:15:55.788 --> 03:16:02.131]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it?

[03:16:26.138 --> 03:16:30.204]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[03:16:30.204 --> 03:16:30.965]  Me too.
[03:16:30.965 --> 03:16:38.075]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[03:16:38.075 --> 03:16:42.061]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[03:16:42.441 --> 03:16:44.343]  You probably already believe that.
[03:16:44.343 --> 03:16:45.364]  I certainly do.
[03:16:45.364 --> 03:16:46.305]  So here's the thing.
[03:16:46.305 --> 03:16:55.193]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[03:16:55.193 --> 03:16:59.917]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[03:17:26.053 --> 03:17:27.273]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:27.273 --> 03:17:31.195]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:31.195 --> 03:17:32.735]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:32.735 --> 03:17:35.696]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:35.696 --> 03:17:41.258]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:41.258 --> 03:17:42.458]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:42.458 --> 03:17:45.399]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:45.399 --> 03:17:47.600]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:47.600 --> 03:17:52.041]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:52.041 --> 03:17:54.382]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:56.844 --> 03:18:01.445]  You want to have a double-blind, randomized placebo testing.
[03:18:01.445 --> 03:18:15.749]  What that means is you give 20,000 people the vaccine when it comes to phase 2, phase 3 trials, and you give 20,000 people a placebo, and then you really look at health outcomes for a long period of time, not four weeks.
[03:18:17.231 --> 03:18:21.477]  A lot of these injuries, the autoimmune injuries, you're not going to see in four weeks.
[03:18:21.477 --> 03:18:24.401]  The cancer, you're not going to see in four weeks.
[03:18:24.401 --> 03:18:30.990]  And many of the neurological injuries, you won't see for four weeks, if the experience with other vaccines is instructive.
[03:18:32.271 --> 03:18:41.440]  You look at the other vaccines that are currently in the schedule, and there's about 400 injuries, illnesses, chronic illnesses that are listed.
[03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:42.641]  Robert Kennedy Jr.

[03:19:48.051 --> 03:19:49.432]  Just pour and add water.
[03:19:49.432 --> 03:19:50.313]  It's that simple.
[03:19:50.313 --> 03:19:59.944]  Visit thebiopros.com and see for yourself.
[03:19:59.944 --> 03:20:02.587]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.776 --> 03:20:18.858]  Hi, I'm Kate Daly, your guest host today, and what a terrific show.
[03:20:18.858 --> 03:20:19.679]  Wow.
[03:20:19.679 --> 03:20:23.841]  And I'll tell you something, I've had Greg on my show and he's been amazing.
[03:20:23.841 --> 03:20:26.222]  Everybody loves him because he's just so transparent.
[03:20:26.222 --> 03:20:29.124]  He's just honest and he'll just tell you exactly what he's doing in the market.
[03:20:29.124 --> 03:20:30.125]  A former physician, he
[03:20:31.385 --> 03:20:38.067]  Is now the Robin Hood of Wall Street, as we call him, and then also TradersChoice.net.
[03:20:38.067 --> 03:20:51.209]  Greg, I rely on Greg for a lot of great information when it comes to, hey, you might want to be aware of this or that, and I've even taken Greg's advice, and that's why I wanted to have you on the show today, and I'm really excited that you're here, Greg, Greg Manorino.
[03:20:51.209 --> 03:20:54.570]  And so, a friend came to me, said, hey, I just sold a house.
[03:20:54.850 --> 03:20:55.850]  A lot of people are doing this.
[03:20:55.850 --> 03:20:57.351]  They're killing the market, right?
[03:20:57.351 --> 03:21:00.292]  They're able to recoup a lot of money.
[03:21:00.292 --> 03:21:02.632]  That $100,000, I don't know what to do with it.
[03:21:02.632 --> 03:21:15.656]  I don't know what's the safest thing right now with all of the turmoil happening and what we know this King fraud a lot and Hormala and everything they're going to be bringing on is the puppetry of what we know is going on from the deep state.
[03:21:16.136 --> 03:21:17.277]  What do I do with it?
[03:21:17.277 --> 03:21:18.539]  What do you tell somebody like that?
[03:21:18.539 --> 03:21:26.226]  It's a basic question for you because I know that you're in this 24-7, probably very basic, but what would you tell somebody like that?
[03:21:26.226 --> 03:21:27.948]  What would you do with that kind of cash?
[03:21:30.561 --> 03:21:33.483]  You've got to stay hedged.
[03:21:33.483 --> 03:21:35.044]  How do I sleep at night?
[03:21:35.044 --> 03:21:50.192]  By understanding the dynamics of the market, what's going on, and keeping myself and those that follow my work in such a way that they really don't care which way the market goes to a certain degree.
[03:21:50.192 --> 03:21:52.794]  Understanding the current environment is key.
[03:21:52.794 --> 03:21:54.735]  We have a runaway central
[03:21:57.655 --> 03:22:00.957]  And they are running the entire show.
[03:22:00.957 --> 03:22:03.058]  They are issuing debt through one door.
[03:22:03.058 --> 03:22:04.559]  They're buying it back through another door.
[03:22:04.559 --> 03:22:13.724]  This has inflated a massive hyper-debt bubble, the largest Frankenstein monster in the history of the world.
[03:22:13.724 --> 03:22:15.305]  We've never seen anything like it before.
[03:22:15.305 --> 03:22:17.086]  And this is all by design.
[03:22:17.086 --> 03:22:19.027]  Again, what is the Fed trying to do?
[03:22:19.027 --> 03:22:21.108]  And we'll answer that question a little more
[03:22:23.155 --> 03:22:24.376]  In depth in a moment.
[03:22:24.376 --> 03:22:33.540]  The Fed is fulfilling their endgame, their final solution, that is to one day become the lender and buyer of last resort.
[03:22:33.540 --> 03:22:49.447]  With this whole thing and the scandamic connected to it, we were told from a long time ago that something like this would be used on the world to shut down the global economies, which would allow central banks to finish what they started a long time ago, to become the controlling power of the world.
[03:22:49.967 --> 03:22:50.707]  I think so.
[03:23:11.172 --> 03:23:13.133]  Big companies that pay a dividend.
[03:23:13.133 --> 03:23:19.218]  I am paid per share to own their stock in a market that keeps going higher.
[03:23:19.218 --> 03:23:21.339]  It's going to continue higher until it doesn't.
[03:23:21.339 --> 03:23:27.664]  Now we can use that indicator I was explaining to you a moment ago to gauge where the market's going to go.
[03:23:27.664 --> 03:23:29.625]  We can look at the 10-year yield.
[03:23:29.625 --> 03:23:31.126]  We can look at the dollar index.
[03:23:31.126 --> 03:23:32.307]  We can look at crude oil.
[03:23:32.307 --> 03:23:34.408]  A lot of things.
[03:23:36.044 --> 03:23:37.346]  You've got to be along the market.
[03:23:37.346 --> 03:23:40.910]  You've got to be also thinking what's going to happen when the market rolls over.
[03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:42.431]  Right now the market remains risk on.
[03:23:42.431 --> 03:23:43.132]  It's very simple.
[03:23:43.132 --> 03:23:45.235]  Risk on meaning cash going into equities.
[03:23:45.235 --> 03:23:48.519]  It's going to roll over at one point to risk off.
[03:23:48.519 --> 03:23:49.339]  We've seen this before.
[03:23:49.339 --> 03:23:50.761]  The market runs in cycles.
[03:23:50.761 --> 03:23:52.163]  Risk on, risk off.
[03:23:52.483 --> 03:23:53.744]  Risk on, risk off.
[03:23:53.744 --> 03:24:04.315]  Risk off assets, for example, would be things like physical gold, more importantly physical silver, which I believe is the most undivided asset in the history of the world.
[03:24:04.315 --> 03:24:05.636]  How can people gauge that?
[03:24:05.636 --> 03:24:09.640]  How can people tell that Greg Manarino is correct in his assumption?
[03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:10.540]  Thank you very much.
[03:24:31.915 --> 03:24:36.277]  The debt market is going to implode by design at one particular time.
[03:24:36.277 --> 03:24:37.638]  It's going to burst.
[03:24:37.638 --> 03:24:44.881]  When the debt bubble bursts in the same way suppressed rates have allowed a hyperbubble to develop in the stock market, it's going to reverse.
[03:24:44.881 --> 03:24:47.482]  So you're going to get a massive sell-off in the debt market.
[03:24:47.482 --> 03:24:49.023]  Rates are going to spike rapidly.
[03:24:49.023 --> 03:24:50.944]  That's going to put a lot of pressure on the stock market.
[03:24:51.377 --> 03:24:52.638]  And what's that going to do?
[03:24:52.638 --> 03:25:01.921]  Cash is going to leave both the debt market and the stock market and just simply move from one asset class into other asset classes.
[03:25:01.921 --> 03:25:06.023]  And I believe these asset classes are going to be suppressed ones.
[03:25:06.023 --> 03:25:11.385]  For example, hard assets, like I just said, gold, silver, I think platinum and palladium.
[03:25:11.385 --> 03:25:13.166]  I also think cryptocurrencies as well.
[03:25:13.166 --> 03:25:17.388]  I don't care what they're trying to do with regulation with regard to cryptos right now, especially China.
[03:25:18.509 --> 03:25:22.653]  I don't think it's going to affect cryptos in the longer run.
[03:25:22.653 --> 03:25:25.456]  Anything can happen in the short run with any asset.
[03:25:25.456 --> 03:25:26.938]  They can be very volatile.
[03:25:26.938 --> 03:25:30.382]  But this is how you protect yourself from every single angle.
[03:25:30.382 --> 03:25:31.523]  You understand what's going on?
[03:25:32.242 --> 03:25:33.383]  You take in the big picture.
[03:25:33.383 --> 03:25:34.344]  I'm a macro guy.
[03:25:34.344 --> 03:25:38.947]  I look at everything as a whole and then I start to laser in on what needs to be done here.
[03:25:38.947 --> 03:25:46.752]  And I think it's a very simple, very straightforward strategy to beat the market no matter what happens.
[03:25:46.752 --> 03:25:48.534]  So this is how I can sleep at night.
[03:25:48.534 --> 03:25:52.897]  If you're so inclined, I mean, you can trade the market, you can sell options onto the market.
[03:25:52.897 --> 03:25:54.298]  That's what I'm doing now.
[03:25:54.298 --> 03:25:57.520]  I'm a net seller of options.
[03:25:57.520 --> 03:25:59.562]  I don't like to buy options anymore.
[03:25:59.562 --> 03:25:59.822]  You can
[03:26:00.662 --> 03:26:02.343]  The market is such a twisted place.
[03:26:02.343 --> 03:26:04.124]  I want you people to consider this.
[03:26:04.124 --> 03:26:08.967]  What I do when I sell options onto the market, I'm selling options I don't even own.
[03:26:08.967 --> 03:26:10.648]  It's called naked.
[03:26:10.648 --> 03:26:12.689]  I'm selling options naked.
[03:26:12.689 --> 03:26:14.610]  I'm selling something I don't own.
[03:26:14.610 --> 03:26:15.891]  I want you to think about that.
[03:26:15.891 --> 03:26:17.112]  And this is what's going on here.
[03:26:17.112 --> 03:26:18.272]  I mean, anyone can do it.
[03:26:18.272 --> 03:26:19.393]  This is no big secret.
[03:26:20.653 --> 03:26:24.274]  I've been doing this repeatedly, over and over, rolling over every single month.
[03:26:24.274 --> 03:26:26.974]  Everything I'm doing is right on my website, TradersChoice.net.
[03:26:26.974 --> 03:26:31.675]  My particular positions I'm in, it's all there.
[03:26:31.675 --> 03:26:40.296]  I want people to capitalize on this, is really what I really want them to do, by understanding what's happening around them, and not just in the financial markets.
[03:26:40.296 --> 03:26:44.117]  Everything connected to it, because nothing is what it seems to be.
[03:26:44.117 --> 03:26:45.357]  This is much, much bigger.
[03:26:45.357 --> 03:26:49.398]  This is a takeover by central banks around the world.
[03:26:49.918 --> 03:26:50.279]  Thank you.
[03:27:00.769 --> 03:27:01.530]  Absolutely.
[03:27:01.530 --> 03:27:15.037]  In fact, the great reset is really all these corporations, all these investment firms giving to now new sustainable, I hate that word, new sustainable green energy, gender neutral.
[03:27:15.037 --> 03:27:17.218]  Anybody that adopts that gets the cash.
[03:27:17.218 --> 03:27:20.660]  Anybody that doesn't won't get that and they can't grow.
[03:27:20.660 --> 03:27:23.902]  And so you're watching this, I know, and you're looking at the markets.
[03:27:23.902 --> 03:27:24.182]  And so
[03:27:24.602 --> 03:27:30.247]  When you're putting money in, and I know we have about a minute and a half, but we'll come back after the break, certainly.
[03:27:30.247 --> 03:27:39.414]  But as far as crypto goes, as far as where you're putting cash, how much of your, how much of the portfolio should be now invested in crypto?
[03:27:39.414 --> 03:27:43.557]  Because we know that digital currency is going to be, is obviously the monster, right?
[03:27:43.557 --> 03:27:46.460]  Obviously something you should invest in.
[03:27:46.460 --> 03:27:47.020]  What percentage?
[03:27:48.542 --> 03:27:50.324]  I mean, that depends on a lot of things, too.
[03:27:50.324 --> 03:27:55.008]  If you're a high-risk guy like myself, I think it should be a large percentage.
[03:27:55.008 --> 03:28:05.057]  If you're someone, for example, that, you know, doesn't have a lot of money to play with or someone that's worried about, you know, what's going to happen to the... See, look, here's the deal.
[03:28:05.057 --> 03:28:07.900]  Nobody should ever play with scared money.
[03:28:08.712 --> 03:28:23.787]  The moment you start putting cash to work in any asset that you're afraid or that the market is going to roll over or you might lose, you know, you're playing with rent money or whatever it might be, you know, that's when people are going to make bad decisions here in the market here.
[03:28:23.787 --> 03:28:29.373]  And again, if you are a high risk guy who is someone that's not risk averse,
[03:28:30.093 --> 03:28:34.596]  You know, of course, you should be more invested in risky assets.
[03:28:34.596 --> 03:28:38.959]  But if you're looking for stability, it's really difficult to find here right now.
[03:28:38.959 --> 03:28:41.281]  Again, we got metals under pressure.
[03:28:41.281 --> 03:28:42.501]  We know who's rigging the market.
[03:28:42.501 --> 03:28:44.483]  We'll talk more about this after the break.
[03:28:44.483 --> 03:28:46.444]  Actually, why don't we do that?
[03:28:46.444 --> 03:28:48.485]  We'll save the best for last.
[03:28:48.485 --> 03:28:52.128]  My guest, Greg Manarino of the Robin Hood of Wall Street, will be right back.
[03:28:52.128 --> 03:28:53.369]  TradersChoice.net.
[03:28:53.369 --> 03:28:54.610]  I'd be a part of that if I were you.
[03:28:54.610 --> 03:28:55.030]  Be right back.
[03:28:55.697 --> 03:29:09.546]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[03:29:09.546 --> 03:29:14.910]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:29:14.910 --> 03:29:15.590]  But it's true.
[03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:18.993]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:29:19.733 --> 03:29:22.236]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:29:22.236 --> 03:29:24.299]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:29:24.299 --> 03:29:26.061]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:29:26.061 --> 03:29:26.922]  And we're still here.
[03:29:26.922 --> 03:29:31.367]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[03:29:31.367 --> 03:29:32.989]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:29:32.989 --> 03:29:35.112]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:29:35.112 --> 03:29:38.856]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[03:29:39.497 --> 03:29:40.598]  You can't have InfoWars.
[03:29:40.598 --> 03:29:44.642]  It's been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:29:44.642 --> 03:29:46.704]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:29:46.704 --> 03:29:49.426]  So thank you all, and get into InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:29:49.426 --> 03:29:52.869]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:29:52.869 --> 03:29:54.631]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[03:29:54.631 --> 03:29:54.891]  Thank you.
[03:29:56.141 --> 03:29:57.782]  I got some good news.
[03:29:57.782 --> 03:30:04.005]  All the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:30:04.005 --> 03:30:07.306]  The bad news is a lot of them are about to sell out.
[03:30:07.306 --> 03:30:10.948]  So this sale is only going from one week starting on September 29th.
[03:30:10.948 --> 03:30:12.969]  And in the case of green fiber capsules,
[03:30:13.889 --> 03:30:16.250]  These will be sold out in just a couple days.
[03:30:16.250 --> 03:30:17.411]  50% off.
[03:30:17.411 --> 03:30:19.072]  We have Knockout Sleep Aid.
[03:30:19.072 --> 03:30:19.672]  50% off.
[03:30:19.672 --> 03:30:20.873]  Sold out for months.
[03:30:20.873 --> 03:30:21.834]  Very popular.
[03:30:21.834 --> 03:30:23.434]  Twice as strong as Knockout.
[03:30:23.434 --> 03:30:24.875]  Probably too strong for some people.
[03:30:24.875 --> 03:30:26.336]  Totally different formula.
[03:30:26.336 --> 03:30:28.417]  Down and Out is back in stock.
[03:30:28.417 --> 03:30:29.058]  50% off.
[03:30:29.058 --> 03:30:31.799]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12.
[03:30:31.799 --> 03:30:32.580]  50% off.
[03:30:32.580 --> 03:30:36.121]  And also on Deep Earth Crystal Iodine Survival Selects II.
[03:30:36.121 --> 03:30:36.442]  It's all $40.
[03:30:37.763 --> 03:30:39.604]  50% off for one week only.
[03:30:39.604 --> 03:30:41.406]  Take advantage of it and fund the InfoWar.
[03:30:41.406 --> 03:30:42.847]  And I thank you all for your support.
[03:30:42.847 --> 03:30:47.811]  InfoWarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:30:47.811 --> 03:30:49.112]  It's a win-win.
[03:30:49.112 --> 03:30:53.336]  These are things that make you healthy, make your life better, and they fund the InfoWar.
[03:30:53.336 --> 03:30:55.838]  Again, the only way we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[03:30:56.058 --> 03:31:03.580]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[03:31:03.580 --> 03:31:09.101]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[03:31:09.101 --> 03:31:16.663]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[03:31:16.963 --> 03:31:18.424]  Humanity is strong.
[03:31:18.424 --> 03:31:19.384]  We're incredible.
[03:31:19.384 --> 03:31:23.166]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[03:31:23.166 --> 03:31:25.647]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[03:31:25.647 --> 03:31:31.929]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[03:31:31.929 --> 03:31:41.313]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[03:31:41.633 --> 03:31:43.934]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:43.934 --> 03:31:46.596]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[03:31:46.596 --> 03:31:51.939]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, Vazo Beats, and others.
[03:31:51.939 --> 03:31:55.901]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[03:31:56.428 --> 03:32:02.350]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems of these employees.
[03:32:02.350 --> 03:32:13.175]  Because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[03:32:13.175 --> 03:32:16.496]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[03:32:16.496 --> 03:32:18.097]  That taxes the heart.
[03:32:18.097 --> 03:32:19.497]  It taxes the lungs.
[03:32:19.497 --> 03:32:21.298]  And we have given people heart attacks.
[03:32:21.298 --> 03:32:22.579]  By allowing them to work,
[03:32:23.499 --> 03:32:30.825]  With our mouth and nose covered, with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[03:32:30.825 --> 03:32:33.027]  The globalists have told us we're a disease.
[03:32:33.027 --> 03:32:34.928]  They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[03:32:34.928 --> 03:32:43.876]  And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up to one-third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[03:32:43.876 --> 03:32:46.518]  This is a sick cult and we've got to say no.
[03:32:46.518 --> 03:32:50.021]  But the only way the real science gets out to the public is if we tell them.
[03:32:50.481 --> 03:32:53.663]  Get your copy today of COVIDLAND and expose them.
[03:32:53.663 --> 03:32:54.944]  It's COVIDLAND.com.
[03:32:54.944 --> 03:32:59.227]  Go there now.
[03:32:59.227 --> 03:33:01.869]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.363 --> 03:33:18.545]  Hey, Dallie here, your guest host for the hour.
[03:33:18.545 --> 03:33:19.386]  And what an hour!
[03:33:19.386 --> 03:33:23.209]  You really need to pay attention to Greg Manorino, the Robin Hood of Wall Street.
[03:33:23.209 --> 03:33:26.252]  I pay close attention to what Greg says, as many people do.
[03:33:26.252 --> 03:33:33.579]  TradersChoice.net is the website that you need to join and get some advice on what happens next with the markets and things to be aware of.
[03:33:33.579 --> 03:33:36.681]  And I've seen warnings, Greg, coming from the Fed.
[03:33:36.681 --> 03:33:40.144]  Is this the first time we've seen warnings like we're seeing?
[03:33:40.144 --> 03:33:41.686]  I don't remember the last time I've seen
[03:33:42.166 --> 03:33:50.692]  I've seen things, it seems a little scary what's coming from the Fed in warning that things are about to go very, very crazy.
[03:33:50.692 --> 03:33:55.356]  What is, what's your perspective on that?
[03:33:55.356 --> 03:33:57.117]  Well, what are they doing here?
[03:33:57.117 --> 03:33:59.539]  They're trying to create more of the same fear.
[03:33:59.539 --> 03:34:02.321]  Again, make people afraid of one thing, one.
[03:34:07.995 --> 03:34:08.215]  Absolutely.
[03:34:22.892 --> 03:34:23.272]  All right.
[03:34:40.450 --> 03:34:44.031]  Every president in succession must borrow more than the last.
[03:34:44.031 --> 03:34:45.292]  They can't tell you this.
[03:34:45.292 --> 03:34:56.915]  They must allow the central bank to create more debt out of thin air just to support the current environment without the debt expanding exponentially every day.
[03:34:57.716 --> 03:34:58.256]  I'm good.
[03:35:12.762 --> 03:35:20.245]  The show theater that we're seeing right now is about expanding the debt even further than it's already been expanded.
[03:35:20.245 --> 03:35:22.466]  It's out of control here.
[03:35:22.466 --> 03:35:23.947]  Just look at the last few presidents.
[03:35:23.947 --> 03:35:27.888]  You see how many trillions of dollars they have added to the national debt here.
[03:35:27.888 --> 03:35:29.169]  And you think this is by accident?
[03:35:29.169 --> 03:35:30.029]  They can't tell people.
[03:35:30.029 --> 03:35:36.652]  You see, no sitting president, I don't care who they are, can't allow people to understand the mechanism, how it actually works.
[03:35:36.652 --> 03:35:36.972]  They know.
[03:35:37.592 --> 03:35:50.990]  Members of Congress know, but they're not allowed to share what they don't want to because their bosses are telling them not to share the information with the actual people who are being destroyed by this very system.
[03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:54.475]  The system today is, again, it's so twisted and so out of control.
[03:35:54.895 --> 03:35:55.796]  So what are they going to do?
[03:35:55.796 --> 03:35:57.077]  They've got to create anxiety.
[03:35:57.077 --> 03:35:58.318]  They've got to create fear.
[03:35:58.318 --> 03:36:03.962]  We have Janet Yellen over the last couple of trading days explaining about a catastrophe.
[03:36:03.962 --> 03:36:08.886]  You've got Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P.
[03:36:08.886 --> 03:36:12.649]  Morgan, explaining the same kind of thing, a collapse, a meltdown of this.
[03:36:12.649 --> 03:36:13.709]  And people are afraid.
[03:36:13.709 --> 03:36:20.034]  People remember what happened to them last time with regard to the market, with regard to housing prices, but they don't know what to do.
[03:36:20.034 --> 03:36:20.915]  So they're paralyzed.
[03:36:21.295 --> 03:36:24.157]  And again, it's just a game that they're playing to keep people off balance.
[03:36:24.157 --> 03:36:28.360]  It's the same thing that they always do, because most people are very easily manipulated.
[03:36:28.360 --> 03:36:39.808]  And they understand that people are sitting there, stuck watching the program device in their living room, getting literally programmed, being made to be afraid of things.
[03:36:40.608 --> 03:36:41.489]  It drives me crazy.
[03:36:41.489 --> 03:36:42.470]  It really, really does.
[03:36:42.470 --> 03:36:43.290]  No.
[03:36:43.290 --> 03:36:45.832]  The moment you become afraid is the moment you lose.
[03:36:45.832 --> 03:36:50.516]  So what we do is we sit back and we just try to take this whole thing and realize what we need to do.
[03:36:50.516 --> 03:36:51.117]  So good.
[03:36:51.117 --> 03:36:52.117]  Let them play their games.
[03:36:52.117 --> 03:36:53.438]  The debt is in a hyper bubble.
[03:36:53.438 --> 03:36:54.179]  We know that.
[03:36:54.179 --> 03:36:57.141]  At one particular point, this debt is going to become a major issue.
[03:36:57.141 --> 03:37:01.084]  We're starting to see inflation, although they're telling us it was initially what?
[03:37:01.084 --> 03:37:03.366]  Powell, the Fed chair.
[03:37:03.366 --> 03:37:04.847]  It was not widespread.
[03:37:04.847 --> 03:37:05.928]  It was contained.
[03:37:05.928 --> 03:37:07.009]  It's transitory.
[03:37:07.009 --> 03:37:08.210]  Now we'll find out, guess what?
[03:37:08.610 --> 03:37:09.951]  It's not so contained.
[03:37:09.951 --> 03:37:13.114]  It is widespread, and it's not transitory.
[03:37:13.114 --> 03:37:21.040]  Everything they're feeding the people, they're fist-feeding people lie after lie after lie, and people are getting, you know, used to it.
[03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:24.163]  Tell people a little bit of truth, like a show like yours.
[03:37:24.163 --> 03:37:27.025]  Tell them this much truth, and they hate your guts for it.
[03:37:27.025 --> 03:37:27.805]  They don't want to hear it.
[03:37:27.805 --> 03:37:29.547]  People are so used to being lied to.
[03:37:30.996 --> 03:37:31.916]  Thank you!
[03:38:00.541 --> 03:38:06.522]  Planning on what's coming down the pike, which is a complete meltdown of the current market system, which cannot be sustained.
[03:38:06.522 --> 03:38:07.723]  We're in a hyper bubble in debt.
[03:38:07.723 --> 03:38:09.283]  The stock market's a hyper bubble.
[03:38:09.283 --> 03:38:11.603]  They've re-inflated the housing bubble.
[03:38:11.603 --> 03:38:12.604]  This is all by design.
[03:38:12.604 --> 03:38:18.465]  The Federal Reserve creating distortions across the spectrum of asset classes, unlike anything we've ever seen before.
[03:38:18.465 --> 03:38:20.505]  But there lies the opportunity.
[03:38:20.505 --> 03:38:23.486]  Understanding that the market is a hyper bubble, it's going to burst one day.
[03:38:23.486 --> 03:38:24.046]  What are we going to do?
[03:38:24.326 --> 03:38:28.828]  What are people like Greg Manarino going to do when the market starts to melt down?
[03:38:28.828 --> 03:38:35.911]  Well, I'm going to short it, which means I'm going to bet against it, just like the Wall Street banks are going to do, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan.
[03:38:35.911 --> 03:38:37.172]  I'm going to do the same thing.
[03:38:37.172 --> 03:38:45.475]  I run my blog like a fund manager is really what I do, and I tell everyone what I'm doing so they should maybe follow along.
[03:38:45.475 --> 03:38:51.878]  And at the same time here, again, we're going to get a wealth transfer, which is already happening on an unbelievable scale.
[03:38:51.878 --> 03:38:53.239]  We're going to see cash move.
[03:38:53.519 --> 03:38:55.380]  We're not going to be afraid.
[03:38:55.380 --> 03:39:00.101]  We're going to use this as a weapon against those that want to make us afraid.
[03:39:00.101 --> 03:39:00.381]  Good.
[03:39:00.381 --> 03:39:01.542]  Let them play their game.
[03:39:01.542 --> 03:39:02.162]  We will play ours.
[03:39:02.162 --> 03:39:02.442]  Period.
[03:39:02.442 --> 03:39:02.702]  The end.
[03:39:20.183 --> 03:39:20.923]  Absolutely.
[03:39:20.923 --> 03:39:26.146]  I don't know of another trader that I trust that understands the deep state as well as you do.
[03:39:26.146 --> 03:39:37.130]  You talk about a lot YouTube censoring now and I can't believe all of the, well you know what I do believe because they were actually propped up with us with In-Q-Tel and CIA money and everything else.
[03:39:37.130 --> 03:39:38.171]  All of it's part of government.
[03:39:38.171 --> 03:39:38.791]  They're all government.
[03:39:38.791 --> 03:39:40.251]  They're not private businesses.
[03:39:40.251 --> 03:39:48.355]  So knowing what's coming, knowing how fast and swift this fraud fraudulent administration is moving.
[03:39:49.366 --> 03:39:50.926]  What do you see next six months?
[03:39:50.926 --> 03:39:55.047]  Because you are so good at looking ahead and saying, I think this is coming next.
[03:39:55.047 --> 03:39:57.568]  I think this is exactly what's on the horizon.
[03:39:57.568 --> 03:39:59.448]  What would you say next six months look like?
[03:39:59.448 --> 03:40:07.729]  I think we're going to see more mind twisting, number one, from the mainstream propaganda channels.
[03:40:07.729 --> 03:40:15.871]  They're going to try to convince people sincerely, and they're doing it already, that what people are seeing and witnessing for themselves is not true.
[03:40:16.571 --> 03:40:17.532]  That's what they're going to do.
[03:40:17.532 --> 03:40:19.112]  It's what they always do.
[03:40:19.112 --> 03:40:21.653]  So I expect another campaign here.
[03:40:21.653 --> 03:40:25.275]  I talked about this recently.
[03:40:25.275 --> 03:40:25.935]  It's going to happen.
[03:40:25.935 --> 03:40:27.136]  They're going to start talking about it.
[03:40:27.136 --> 03:40:30.817]  They're trying to convince people right now what they're seeing is not real.
[03:40:30.817 --> 03:40:33.238]  But it's out of control.
[03:40:33.238 --> 03:40:38.401]  The thing is, what worries me, is there are some people that are so locked into this they can't think.
[03:40:38.401 --> 03:40:41.922]  Again, no free thought, no free action, no free movement.
[03:40:41.922 --> 03:40:43.263]  You're not allowed to think for yourself.
[03:40:43.263 --> 03:40:45.664]  You're not allowed to express your own opinion anymore.
[03:40:46.744 --> 03:40:48.765]  That's completely out of control.
[03:40:48.765 --> 03:40:50.186]  You must fall in line.
[03:40:50.186 --> 03:40:53.208]  You must conform, conform, conform.
[03:40:53.208 --> 03:41:03.092]  You know, this fascist, communist mentality has really gripped, I think, a large portion of the population because they want to be taken care of from cradle to grave.
[03:41:03.092 --> 03:41:04.073]  They're struggling.
[03:41:04.073 --> 03:41:11.496]  They're struggling by design so they can go to mother government and say, which is the central banks and the Fed, please help me.
[03:41:11.496 --> 03:41:14.378]  You know, so they're willing to accept anything.
[03:41:15.419 --> 03:41:19.142]  Well, you know, again, look at our senators.
[03:41:19.142 --> 03:41:19.822]  Look at all these people.
[03:41:19.822 --> 03:41:23.045]  They're all multi-millionaires for the most part here.
[03:41:23.045 --> 03:41:24.806]  They don't practice anything that they preach.
[03:41:24.806 --> 03:41:26.548]  They're talking about equality.
[03:41:26.548 --> 03:41:27.729]  It's never going to be like that.
[03:41:27.729 --> 03:41:29.931]  It's just, it's an agenda.
[03:41:29.931 --> 03:41:33.253]  Again, it's a distraction in so many ways.
[03:41:33.253 --> 03:41:34.614]  So you're going to see more of that.
[03:41:34.614 --> 03:41:35.535]  More distraction.
[03:41:35.535 --> 03:41:37.217]  More look here, don't look here.
[03:41:37.217 --> 03:41:39.919]  But don't let this phase you.
[03:41:41.184 --> 03:41:43.105]  You've got to kind of put that all aside.
[03:41:43.105 --> 03:41:51.427]  If you're looking at this from a perspective of what you can do for yourself from a financial standpoint, you've got to push it all aside.
[03:41:51.427 --> 03:42:00.049]  You've got to understand what's going on, realize the mechanism that's going on, and then make decisions for yourself without fear.
[03:42:00.763 --> 03:42:03.805]  So they will be the correct ones moving forward.
[03:42:03.805 --> 03:42:08.789]  They want people broke, destitute, worried, struggling.
[03:42:08.789 --> 03:42:10.430]  This is how they control their minds.
[03:42:10.430 --> 03:42:12.892]  This is how they become slaves to the system.
[03:42:12.892 --> 03:42:20.838]  So people like you, people like me, who maybe have a few, and people that are listening, I'm sure, have a few functioning brain cells.
[03:42:20.838 --> 03:42:23.380]  We are a direct threat
[03:42:24.475 --> 03:42:27.477]  And there's also the threat that maybe we're going to start talking to some other people.
[03:42:27.477 --> 03:42:29.979]  Maybe we'll tell people to watch shows like yours.
[03:42:29.979 --> 03:42:30.999]  Maybe they'll understand.
[03:42:30.999 --> 03:42:32.260]  Whoa, hold on a minute here.
[03:42:32.260 --> 03:42:33.361]  Something else is going on.
[03:42:33.361 --> 03:42:36.322]  That's why they're trying to shut us down.
[03:42:36.322 --> 03:42:36.703]  Period.
[03:42:36.703 --> 03:42:36.983]  The end.
[03:42:36.983 --> 03:42:40.425]  I think you and I are literally going to go extinct soon.
[03:42:40.425 --> 03:42:43.167]  There you go.
[03:42:43.167 --> 03:42:46.789]  Greg Manarino, Robin Hood of Wall Street, TradersChoice.net.
[03:42:46.789 --> 03:42:48.610]  You must follow him on Facebook.
[03:42:48.610 --> 03:42:50.511]  He says things that other people won't say.
[03:42:50.511 --> 03:42:51.992]  Love you, Greg.
[03:42:51.992 --> 03:42:52.873]  Thank you.
[03:42:52.873 --> 03:42:53.153]  Thank you.
[03:42:54.929 --> 03:43:00.273]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.
[03:43:00.273 --> 03:43:05.117]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[03:43:05.117 --> 03:43:09.981]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[03:43:09.981 --> 03:43:12.883]  I want you to know that I love you, and I appreciate you.
[03:43:12.883 --> 03:43:16.226]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[03:43:16.226 --> 03:43:17.447]  You've got red blood.
[03:43:17.447 --> 03:43:24.373]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been
[03:43:24.973 --> 03:43:27.895]  An incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[03:43:27.895 --> 03:43:31.757]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[03:43:31.757 --> 03:43:34.659]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[03:43:34.659 --> 03:43:40.302]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[03:43:40.302 --> 03:43:42.183]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[03:43:42.183 --> 03:43:46.585]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[03:43:46.585 --> 03:43:50.688]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[03:43:50.688 --> 03:43:53.649]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars.
[03:43:53.649 --> 03:43:54.030]  God bless.
[03:43:54.861 --> 03:44:04.069]  People ask me, Alex, why did you come out with a new natural organic sleep aid when you already have knockout that works so well with eight natural ingredients?
[03:44:04.069 --> 03:44:11.276]  Well, because when you've taken a certain organic blend for a decade, like I've taken this product I came up with, it doesn't work as well anymore.
[03:44:11.576 --> 03:44:12.857]  That's the way herbs work.
[03:44:12.857 --> 03:44:16.338]  You go off on a while, come back on it, it works again.
[03:44:16.338 --> 03:44:16.998]  So what did I do?
[03:44:16.998 --> 03:44:28.243]  I went to the developers and I said, make a totally different formula with a lot of other known natural healthy compounds that make you sleep deep and restful, because that's what helps your immune system, and I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout.
[03:44:28.943 --> 03:44:30.764]  Okay, be careful when you take it.
[03:44:30.764 --> 03:44:32.085]  It's incredibly strong.
[03:44:32.085 --> 03:44:33.146]  It's named Down-N-Out.
[03:44:33.146 --> 03:44:38.530]  I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it, but it is extremely strong and we are extremely proud of it.
[03:44:38.530 --> 03:44:42.733]  It is exclusively available at m4warstore.com.
[03:44:42.733 --> 03:44:44.394]  50% off right now.

[03:44:50.899 --> 03:44:53.201]  I thank you for your support because it keeps us on the air.
[03:44:56.215 --> 03:44:59.958]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[03:44:59.958 --> 03:45:03.680]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[03:45:03.680 --> 03:45:11.325]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[03:45:11.325 --> 03:45:17.089]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[03:45:17.089 --> 03:45:25.815]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money
[03:45:26.215 --> 03:45:26.515]  That's right.
[03:45:49.861 --> 03:45:51.627]  All of it nurtures the soul.
[03:45:51.627 --> 03:45:53.231]  All of it empowers humanity.
[03:45:53.231 --> 03:45:55.698]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[03:45:55.698 --> 03:45:56.340]  Thank you so much.
[03:45:57.284 --> 03:46:02.686]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered?
[03:46:02.686 --> 03:46:04.727]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store?
[03:46:04.727 --> 03:46:06.447]  Do you think they would let you in?
[03:46:06.447 --> 03:46:11.089]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting?
[03:46:11.089 --> 03:46:19.392]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on?
[03:46:19.392 --> 03:46:21.012]  How far do you think that would get you?
[03:46:21.012 --> 03:46:25.594]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space
[03:46:26.374 --> 03:46:27.295]  Alien?
[03:46:27.295 --> 03:46:34.421]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[03:46:34.421 --> 03:46:38.064]  The globalists are running a psychological war for operational humanity.
[03:46:38.064 --> 03:46:40.846]  Only waking up to the Great Reset and its tyranny will save us.
[03:46:41.607 --> 03:46:43.909]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[03:46:43.909 --> 03:46:49.893]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud, and that it's dangerous, and that it causes major medical issues, and it's dehumanizing.
[03:46:49.893 --> 03:46:51.474]  And the film COVIDland does that.

[03:46:59.040 --> 03:47:01.662]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.818 --> 03:47:18.819]  Hi, I'm Kate Dally, your guest host, and I want to cover some things.
[03:47:18.819 --> 03:47:21.800]  By the way, thank you, Greg Manarino, Robin Hood of Wall Street.
[03:47:21.800 --> 03:47:22.621]  He's fantastic.
[03:47:22.621 --> 03:47:23.501]  You should follow him.
[03:47:23.501 --> 03:47:28.563]  He's given us a lot of great ideas on what to invest in next, and he's fantastic.
[03:47:28.563 --> 03:47:35.725]  So I really appreciate that he understands what's going on with the deep state, king fraud a lot, you know, Kamala, Kamala, I don't even, what is her name?
[03:47:35.725 --> 03:47:36.266]  Hormala?
[03:47:36.266 --> 03:47:37.226]  I just go to Hormala.
[03:47:37.226 --> 03:47:39.807]  I just, anyway, that's what I call her.
[03:47:39.807 --> 03:47:40.987]  You know, what a feminist.
[03:47:40.987 --> 03:47:42.068]  Sleep your way to the top.
[03:47:42.068 --> 03:47:42.868]  Gotta love that about her.
[03:47:43.969 --> 03:47:48.173]  Nothing says strength as a woman than sleep your way to the top.
[03:47:48.173 --> 03:48:05.808]  So, we're not hearing much from her, which I actually thought that would be the case, because I think by the time they probably take Biden off the market, let's say, either blame a patriot for the act, of course, and a false flag, or whatever they do, and prop her up.
[03:48:05.808 --> 03:48:09.472]  She's always been propped up by Obama's people, so it will be very interesting to see
[03:48:10.092 --> 03:48:14.677]  What happens next with the whole fraudulent administration?
[03:48:14.677 --> 03:48:20.522]  Let's talk about a couple things we know right now, and then let's talk about a couple of things that we should be planning.
[03:48:20.522 --> 03:48:32.814]  I always find it interesting that you can go back to the Rockefeller Report, you can go back to all of these projects that they design, all of these things that they do out in the public eye, telling us what they're going to do, but we never do that in reverse.
[03:48:33.474 --> 03:48:35.797]  We never tell them what the masses will do.
[03:48:35.797 --> 03:48:36.799]  We never plan.
[03:48:36.799 --> 03:48:38.240]  We don't have these projects.
[03:48:38.240 --> 03:48:39.202]  Why not?
[03:48:39.202 --> 03:48:40.343]  We should.
[03:48:40.343 --> 03:48:43.187]  So a couple of things that are going on right now, let's be very aware, right?
[03:48:44.133 --> 03:48:49.878]  So it always intrigued me that no one ever worked on a single medicine for COVID.
[03:48:49.878 --> 03:48:58.104]  That should be very telling, and I know that you as an audience understand this, and I won't go into this very deep, but my gosh, not even pharma.
[03:48:58.104 --> 03:48:59.725]  Nobody was really working on any medicine.
[03:48:59.725 --> 03:49:03.048]  It was vaccine from the start, and Sarah Gilbert, who worked for Gates,
[03:49:03.568 --> 03:49:12.093]  Oxford announced in January that they were already starting on the cure before they even had named COVID-19.
[03:49:12.093 --> 03:49:14.934]  So this has always been about vaccination, multiple vaccinations.
[03:49:14.934 --> 03:49:15.935]  We know that.
[03:49:15.935 --> 03:49:17.856]  And they are a disaster.
[03:49:17.856 --> 03:49:23.059]  In fact, looking at slides last night of blood, it's horrific actually to see what's going on.
[03:49:23.639 --> 03:49:23.899]  I think?
[03:49:44.716 --> 03:49:47.158]  Talks about suicide, people driven to suicide.
[03:49:47.158 --> 03:49:51.480]  Euthanasia is going to be something that I was looking at at Australia.
[03:49:51.480 --> 03:49:59.505]  They were trying to pass a bill that says, hey, if somebody's afraid, if somebody's afraid, they could be euthanized voluntarily.
[03:49:59.505 --> 03:50:00.566]  You're going to see a lot of that.
[03:50:00.566 --> 03:50:02.467]  That's why I like Greg's message.
[03:50:02.467 --> 03:50:05.069]  Greg's message was all about, hey, you know what?
[03:50:05.069 --> 03:50:08.090]  Don't be afraid of what's happening right now.
[03:50:08.090 --> 03:50:10.272]  Learn to calculate what you're going to do next.
[03:50:11.052 --> 03:50:12.673]  The border, where are they coming from?
[03:50:12.673 --> 03:50:18.255]  They're obviously bought and paid for to come to the border at this time.
[03:50:18.255 --> 03:50:25.258]  And I always find it interesting that when headlines hit, and they want to divert the headlines, it's always to something that they've created.
[03:50:25.258 --> 03:50:30.760]  Either when we were talking about fraudulent elections, of course we got the Afghanistan drop, right?
[03:50:30.760 --> 03:50:35.882]  And that absolute monster of a situation in Afghanistan.
[03:50:35.882 --> 03:50:39.023]  I spoke to somebody on the ground there, and somebody that owns a store,
[03:50:39.503 --> 03:50:49.334]  And they said, you know, they said, we all know that the leaders of these groups are in Pakistan and that they're not here.
[03:50:49.334 --> 03:50:54.620]  And that most of the people in the Taliban are actually Afghani nationalists.
[03:50:54.620 --> 03:50:58.545]  But then you have the few that are run by those that live out of the country.
[03:50:59.245 --> 03:51:10.893]  And they said, you know, they said they knew that the situation was going to go south because these are older men and younger boys and could have never, never shored up their own army, so to speak.
[03:51:10.893 --> 03:51:14.135]  So there's a lot going on there that we could talk about, too.
[03:51:14.135 --> 03:51:21.560]  But NYC, New York, saying that if you walk out, if you walk out, we're going to hire foreigners.
[03:51:21.560 --> 03:51:25.943]  We're going to make sure foreigners fill your spots, not people from other countries.
[03:51:25.943 --> 03:51:26.023]  No.
[03:51:26.917 --> 03:51:27.677]  Foreigners.
[03:51:27.677 --> 03:51:32.139]  And so you're going to see a lot of foreigners brought in if people dare to leave their job.
[03:51:32.139 --> 03:51:33.699]  And they're doing this in droves.
[03:51:33.699 --> 03:51:35.520]  We have people suing the schools.
[03:51:35.520 --> 03:51:37.381]  We have educators suing right now.
[03:51:37.381 --> 03:51:41.822]  We've got the firemen that I had on in California.
[03:51:41.822 --> 03:51:44.263]  They are causing a lot of people to do the same.
[03:51:44.263 --> 03:51:46.043]  And then also people are walking out.
[03:51:46.043 --> 03:51:47.464]  They're just simply walking away.
[03:51:48.184 --> 03:51:53.810]  And I can't even imagine something more horrific than having more foreigners coming in for those jobs.
[03:51:53.810 --> 03:52:06.344]  But I was also looking at the headlines in Australia too, and are the UN cops now occupying the seats of their federal military presence on the ground, their federal police force, if you will?
[03:52:07.074 --> 03:52:09.275]  Well, it's a possibility, right?
[03:52:09.275 --> 03:52:11.716]  We kind of knew that was probably going to come.
[03:52:11.716 --> 03:52:13.677]  And so Australia scares me.
[03:52:13.677 --> 03:52:14.938]  Australia is the one.
[03:52:14.938 --> 03:52:16.338]  It's the craft show.
[03:52:16.338 --> 03:52:19.260]  Everybody's watching this saying, what's going to happen next?
[03:52:19.260 --> 03:52:20.900]  But they're also part of Five Eyes.
[03:52:20.900 --> 03:52:26.543]  And so I absolutely think that we're going to get a huge dose of this coming.
[03:52:27.302 --> 03:52:28.663]  Now, what can we do?
[03:52:28.663 --> 03:52:30.563]  They're weakening our military on purpose.
[03:52:30.563 --> 03:52:31.544]  We know this.
[03:52:31.544 --> 03:52:35.525]  And the jabs are wreaking havoc on people's immune systems.
[03:52:35.525 --> 03:52:43.108]  Like the good doctors are saying, you know, two years you're going to see a lot of cancer and a lot of immune system problems and health goes sideways.
[03:52:43.108 --> 03:52:44.748]  And so what is going to happen?
[03:52:44.748 --> 03:52:49.850]  Well, pharma is loving it because pharma is going to get big fat paychecks for all the health crises going on in America.
[03:52:50.410 --> 03:52:55.035]  But even when I look at the military, please stand as units.
[03:52:55.035 --> 03:52:55.936]  Whole units.
[03:52:55.936 --> 03:53:00.862]  We need whole units to go after religious exemptions together and shore each other up.
[03:53:00.862 --> 03:53:08.691]  Even if you believe in this monstrosity and you're that much of a moron, please, please stand with your unit and make sure those that want the choice
[03:53:09.171 --> 03:53:10.131]  Get their choice.
[03:53:10.131 --> 03:53:15.753]  If you're in the military, you are supposed to be standing up for your front line freedom fighters.
[03:53:15.753 --> 03:53:19.135]  We cannot have the military weakened in this way.
[03:53:19.135 --> 03:53:21.755]  So military needs to stand together right now.
[03:53:21.755 --> 03:53:25.997]  They already started in on this with anthrax shots when we were never under an anthrax.
[03:53:26.557 --> 03:53:40.740]  Threat and that shot once they started doing that shot in the 90s that shot started bringing about a lot of depression and suicide and all kinds of things and we haven't even been in a declared war and we're getting this kind of result.
[03:53:40.740 --> 03:53:54.663]  The other things to do to start talking about chartering planes and making sure that you do not have to fly commercial that you can maybe put some money in the gas tank kind of thing you know you know you can't really pay for a flight but hey there's probably ways around that.
[03:53:55.183 --> 03:53:59.185]  And make sure that you are developing networks of people that you know.
[03:53:59.185 --> 03:54:02.386]  If you need to get somewhere, fly private, right?
[03:54:02.386 --> 03:54:05.167]  There's so many things that we can do.
[03:54:05.167 --> 03:54:08.529]  And also, develop networks of doctors.
[03:54:08.529 --> 03:54:11.010]  Doctors need to be opening clinics like crazy.
[03:54:11.010 --> 03:54:12.911]  You're more homeopath doctors.
[03:54:12.911 --> 03:54:14.311]  People need places to go.
[03:54:14.311 --> 03:54:21.154]  I get emails all the time about people not understanding who they can contact to get ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[03:54:21.154 --> 03:54:22.415]  Myfreedoctor.com.
[03:54:23.375 --> 03:54:25.697]  Please, we have to figure out networks.
[03:54:25.697 --> 03:54:32.761]  Start sharing on social media or private messaging, if you will, even in ProtonMail.
[03:54:32.761 --> 03:54:36.804]  Doctors that will actually help you if you go to the hospital and not do the Kevorkian method.
[03:54:36.804 --> 03:54:39.606]  At least Kevorkian smiled and asked permission, right?
[03:54:40.166 --> 03:54:41.127]  Learn skills.
[03:54:41.127 --> 03:54:42.108]  Go to YouTube.
[03:54:42.108 --> 03:54:44.090]  Know how to drill for water.
[03:54:44.090 --> 03:54:45.972]  Water shortages are ridiculous.
[03:54:45.972 --> 03:54:47.514]  You know why they're ridiculous?
[03:54:47.514 --> 03:54:52.919]  Once government started to control water, then all of a sudden now we're dealing with shortages.
[03:54:52.919 --> 03:54:54.821]  We have water underfoot everywhere.
[03:54:54.821 --> 03:54:56.703]  Go to primarywater.org.
[03:54:56.703 --> 03:54:57.684]  Check it out.
[03:54:57.684 --> 03:55:00.227]  Make sure you know how to drill for water.
[03:55:00.227 --> 03:55:00.988]  Get some land.
[03:55:01.648 --> 03:55:01.728]  I'm
[03:55:20.267 --> 03:55:20.807]  We are not slaves.
[03:55:39.208 --> 03:55:41.189]  Get off the mainstream media.
[03:55:41.189 --> 03:55:42.070]  Turn it off.
[03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.930]  Absolutely turn it off.
[03:55:42.930 --> 03:55:44.471]  They're whores anyway.
[03:55:44.471 --> 03:55:46.532]  They're selling you stuff that isn't true.
[03:55:46.532 --> 03:55:50.275]  And start learning skills, basic skills.
[03:55:50.275 --> 03:55:52.476]  Learn how to go off off-grid if you need to.
[03:55:52.896 --> 03:56:04.440]  You know, one of the Rockefeller plans, the plan that brought us COVID-19, talks a lot about rural communities not getting shored up with internet, not being able to have all the luxuries cities will.
[03:56:04.440 --> 03:56:07.301]  High agenda 2030, 2050.
[03:56:07.301 --> 03:56:11.762]  Anyway, and so it's driving people into the cities so they can get services.
[03:56:11.762 --> 03:56:13.743]  Think about the loss of those services.
[03:56:13.743 --> 03:56:16.424]  What would you do without those services at hand?
[03:56:17.004 --> 03:56:19.546]  These are the kinds of things we have to be talking about.
[03:56:19.546 --> 03:56:23.810]  If we can learn how to do some of these things, and also order products.
[03:56:23.810 --> 03:56:25.571]  I would order a lot of supplements right now.
[03:56:25.571 --> 03:56:27.172]  Things are being taken off the market.
[03:56:27.172 --> 03:56:33.898]  NAC, I've heard from some people high up the food chain that NAC will be taken off the market in January.
[03:56:33.898 --> 03:56:36.120]  FDA is trying to get it out.
[03:56:36.120 --> 03:56:38.682]  And same with Ivermectin.
[03:56:38.682 --> 03:56:41.144]  Same with Hydroxy.
[03:56:41.144 --> 03:56:43.145]  They're going to try to ban these things.
[03:56:43.145 --> 03:56:43.966]  These are the things
[03:56:44.656 --> 03:56:47.218]  That right now we can proactively do.
[03:56:47.218 --> 03:56:51.762]  Put your money in some supplements so you have them to share with people that can't afford them.
[03:56:51.762 --> 03:56:54.984]  Get a nebulizer, like Dr. Lee Merritt said.
[03:56:54.984 --> 03:56:57.766]  Make sure that you are handling your health at home.
[03:56:57.766 --> 03:57:00.929]  Make sure that not every book you have is on a Kindle.
[03:57:00.929 --> 03:57:02.990]  Remember, Kindle means firewood.
[03:57:02.990 --> 03:57:03.971]  It's kindling.
[03:57:03.971 --> 03:57:05.072]  It's a book burning.
[03:57:05.072 --> 03:57:09.976]  Remember that you have to have books at home on how to do things.
[03:57:10.436 --> 03:57:17.462]  On how to educate yourself, whatever the case may be, make sure you have all of these things solidly in your home.
[03:57:17.462 --> 03:57:22.927]  Prepping needs to be on, I think, high gear right now, especially with inflation and everything else.
[03:57:22.927 --> 03:57:25.609]  A lot of the things we're going to be talking about on my show today, too.
