[00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:15.665]  It is July 30th, 2017 on this Sunday, live global transmission.
[00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.525]  Tomorrow I'll be back in the ATX.
[00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:20.886]  I am still in Hawaii as we speak.
[00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:22.887]  Wow, we've got major U.S.
[00:00:22.887 --> 00:00:26.288]  companies saying that their employees have to take microchips to work there.
[00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:29.409]  We've got North Korea now able to nuke the mainland U.S.
[00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.511]  We have just got so much incredible information to break down.
[00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:38.855]  It's cutting edge, kind of like Roger Stone on Tuesday saying that General Kelly would replace Reince Priebus.
[00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:45.779]  Here is that report and we'll be back with all the rest of the news days, weeks, months and years before MSM.
[00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:55.886]  There is much speculation after the firing of Sean Spicer about the fate of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.
[00:00:57.068 --> 00:01:09.353]  First of all, the President deserves kudos, in my opinion, for the appointment of Sarah Huckabee Sanders as his Chief Spokeswoman and the White House Press Secretary.
[00:01:09.353 --> 00:01:12.074]  This is a strong appointment.
[00:01:12.074 --> 00:01:21.538]  She's been doing a much better job defending the President and speaking on his behalf than Spicer, and in my view, she well deserves the job.
[00:01:21.538 --> 00:01:25.300]  So congratulations to Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:35.907]  In the meantime, however, it appears that there is a three-way decision that the President has before him regarding the White House Chief of Staff.
[00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:46.951]  On this list are David Urban, a decorated veteran, a former chief of staff on Capitol Hill, the U.S.
[00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:48.793]  Senator Arlen Specter.
[00:01:48.793 --> 00:01:58.179]  But nonetheless, a hardline Trump loyalist who ran the nuts and bolts campaign on the ground in Pennsylvania.
[00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:06.284]  Someone the president knows well and someone who has both administrative skills and political skills.
[00:02:07.353 --> 00:02:15.718]  Urban was the administrative assistant to perhaps the meanest, toughest, smartest, and most difficult member of the U.S.
[00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:18.360]  Senate, Arlen Specter.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:31.828]  This does not in any way reflect the politics of Urban himself, who is a solid Trumpite from the beginning, and in my view, responsible for the historical win in Pennsylvania.
[00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:38.842]  Also, unbelievably, in the running is Dina Habib Howell.
[00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:57.052]  She is a former member of the George W. Bush White House staff, a certified globalist, her best friends, Valerie Jarrett, also Huma Abedin, and then, of course, Condi Rice.
[00:02:58.084 --> 00:03:21.960]  She was very successful in squeezing Rick Grenell, another key Trump supporter, out of the position of NATO ambassador, delivering that to former Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a certified Trump hater, a never-Trumper, who had nothing good to say about candidate Trump during the election.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.083]  And then also, a wild card, and you'll be hearing this first at InfoWars,
[00:03:27.777 --> 00:03:38.744]  General John Kelly, currently the head of Homeland Security, is also in contention for the position of White House Chief of Staff.
[00:03:38.744 --> 00:03:52.172]  Researching Kelly, the first thing that pops up is his status as an unreconstructed drug warrior, someone who agrees with Jeff Sessions on the question of refiring up the failed
[00:03:53.159 --> 00:04:03.267]  Expensive and I think proven disaster that was the war on drugs first initiated by my mentor Richard Nixon.
[00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:12.514]  It is hard to determine with Kelly's military background whether he is in fact a globalist and we're researching that.
[00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:31.481]  But in the meantime, it's very important that the president understand that his next administrative assistant, his next chief of staff, pardon me, should be someone with both administrative... Alright, so there's Roger Stone hosting the show last Tuesday, and we clearly said that Priebus was going to be out by the end of the week, and that Kelly was in the running.
[00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:34.443]  I mean, that's directly from, obviously, our sources.
[00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:39.146]  And a lot of the Washington Post on Friday had to admit that we broke it, but said, oh, we had a lucky guess.
[00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:45.809]  Yeah, we said Priebus would be out by the end of the week and that General Kelly was in them running there and there you go.
[00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.390]  Just showing how good Stone's sources are.
[00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.091]  We have other sources as well.
[00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:56.195]  Now, massively important news from North Korea to publicly having to have a microchip to have a job, it planted in your body.
[00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.496]  It's all coming up straight ahead.
[00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:04.970]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:17.919]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:24.503]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:26.945]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:38.256]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:40.619]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:42.080]  We're getting results.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.046]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:05:48.186 --> 00:05:51.070]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.739]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:18.415]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.584 --> 00:06:33.025]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.147]  It is July 30th, 2017.
[00:06:35.147 --> 00:06:40.431]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
[00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:44.534]  I'll be back on my way to Texas and be there tomorrow.
[00:06:44.534 --> 00:06:51.680]  We have been here to investigate the situation with the elite, like Zuckerberg, moving here to avoid what they themselves have created.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:59.165]  We've also been investigating the Pacific Missile Range Missile Defense System, which is now more important than ever, with North Korea being able to hit basically
[00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:04.050]  As far east as Chicago, easily with ICBMs.
[00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.732]  They've successfully tested that the Japanese and U.S.
[00:07:06.732 --> 00:07:16.461]  government have studied the trajectory and confirmed that indeed the psychopath Kim Jong-un's megalomaniacal threats are indeed reality-based.
[00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:17.822]  They have a special report on that.
[00:07:17.822 --> 00:07:20.524]  I'm going to air first here in just a moment.
[00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:25.189]  Then, we've seen ABC, NBC, CBS, all of them
[00:07:26.476 --> 00:07:30.478]  I'm suddenly saying, soon everybody's going to have a microchip.
[00:07:30.478 --> 00:07:31.539]  Your kids are going to have them.
[00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:32.179]  You're going to have them.
[00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:33.640]  It's going to make everything so simple.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.581]  You'll never lose your wallet again.
[00:07:36.357 --> 00:07:48.966]  Of course, thieves will just steal your RFID number and makes it 10 times worse, or just cut your finger off, you know, to biometrically scan your... I mean, it creates a whole other set of problems, but it gives government total control over your life.
[00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:51.247]  It's perfect for Internet ID.
[00:07:51.247 --> 00:07:52.008]  That's where all this is.
[00:07:52.008 --> 00:07:58.052]  But now they have major US companies, not just companies in Europe, saying, if you want to work here, you're going to take a chip.
[00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:03.335]  I bet it in your hand, in between your middle finger and your index finger.
[00:08:03.335 --> 00:08:04.916]  That report is coming up.
[00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:06.797]  We're going to post it to InfoWars.com.
[00:08:06.797 --> 00:08:10.820]  It's an important John Bowne report, but we're going to take John's report.
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.400]  It's my fault.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.763]  I'm going to try to change this and kind of stick it off on a side YouTube channel.
[00:08:14.763 --> 00:08:17.144]  For whatever reason, I think they're very, very, very powerful.
[00:08:17.144 --> 00:08:19.606]  So we're going to get this posted to Facebook as well.
[00:08:19.606 --> 00:08:23.749]  I'm going to go to InfoWars.com and tweak that out in the next 20 minutes at Real Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.074 --> 00:08:31.097]  Also we have the Obamacare repeal failure, which they're saying is a failure of Trump.
[00:08:31.097 --> 00:08:33.078]  It's called Obamacare.
[00:08:33.078 --> 00:08:35.039]  Trump didn't create it.
[00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:44.403]  Trump now has a good bill to repeal and replace it with something that won't bankrupt the country, it won't double and triple your prices, and that takes care of people that aren't covered.
[00:08:44.403 --> 00:08:47.145]  And Rand Paul has said it's the best plan out there.
[00:08:47.145 --> 00:08:51.847]  And that Obamacare will kill our economy if we don't get rid of it.
[00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:53.528]  Trump isn't the one that did Obamacare.
[00:08:54.226 --> 00:08:58.208]  The globalists are the ones that engage in this activity.
[00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:03.451]  So the way they spin it, National Review, that it's the death of an effing salesman is the headline.
[00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:14.438]  One of the top articles on the web today from the losers at National Review, you know, the never Trumpers who are betting against America and this recovery and openly saying Trump's been a loser his whole life.
[00:09:14.918 --> 00:09:18.560]  The guy came from nowhere from behind and won this presidency.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.021]  That alone is historic and a total winner move.
[00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:23.122]  Everything else he's done has been a total winner move.
[00:09:23.122 --> 00:09:24.983]  He's had 400 and something companies.
[00:09:24.983 --> 00:09:27.244]  Four of them have gone bankrupt.
[00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:29.926]  Most new companies, 70% or more, go bankrupt.
[00:09:29.926 --> 00:09:37.550]  I'm going to break all that down, too, because they're just beating the drum that he's way down in the polls, just like they said during the election, with fake polls.
[00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.052]  You know MSN was more fake than ever, but first, here is an extremely
[00:09:41.966 --> 00:09:48.411]  Important report, the full video is on InfoWars.com that focuses on the new nuke threat, the fact that the U.S.
[00:09:48.411 --> 00:09:53.354]  from Austin, Texas to Chicago, Illinois is now in ICBM nuke range.
[00:09:53.354 --> 00:09:55.236]  But who gave them the nukes?
[00:09:55.236 --> 00:09:59.779]  Spies inside America who've been identified at the highest levels of the government.
[00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:03.642]  Here is the report with myself and of course put together by Michael Zimmerman.
[00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:06.333]  Breaking developments involving North Korea.
[00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:13.859]  Tonight they have launched an intercontinental ballistic missile and this evening experts now saying that this missile went higher and further than before.
[00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:18.963]  Kim Jong-un claims they are now able to hit the entire United States at any time.
[00:10:18.963 --> 00:10:19.804]  Are we in range?
[00:10:20.564 --> 00:10:21.364]  Is it that simple?
[00:10:21.364 --> 00:10:22.725]  Yeah, we probably are.
[00:10:22.725 --> 00:10:25.466]  And if we're not, we will be in range in a month or two.
[00:10:25.466 --> 00:10:29.247]  It looks like this thing can go about 10,000 kilometers.
[00:10:29.247 --> 00:10:33.529]  That means, from North Korea, they could hit most of the United States.
[00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:34.709]  So they've finally done it.
[00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:42.632]  The world is in shock after yesterday's successful launch of an ICBM by North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong-un.
[00:10:43.252 --> 00:10:46.796]  He had previously threatened that he had missiles that were able to hit the U.S.
[00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:49.439]  mainland, including places like Chicago.
[00:10:49.439 --> 00:11:02.052]  And now NASA, as well as Japanese authorities, have looked at the trajectory of yesterday's test missile and confirmed it can hit most of the United States and maybe even New York City, all the way on the East Coast.
[00:11:02.752 --> 00:11:10.237]  On top of all of this, Kim Jong-un is now threatening to nuke the United States, as well as attacking U.S.
[00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:14.019]  Carrier Task Force strike groups that are in the Pacific Ocean.
[00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:21.424]  We're here in Hawaii, which had previously been the closest area of the United States that Kim Jong-un had proven that he could.
[00:11:22.104 --> 00:11:39.737]  Now we're about to drive to the other side of the island to show you the United States Pacific Missile Defense Center that has supersonic interceptor missiles able to shoot down not just Kim Jong-un's ICBMs, but also Russia's and China's.
[00:11:39.737 --> 00:11:40.458]  Intruder alert!
[00:11:40.458 --> 00:11:42.039]  Evacuate bridge!
[00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:45.982]  We have one life support failure in 10 seconds.
[00:11:45.982 --> 00:11:48.904]  This is emergency transmission.
[00:11:52.993 --> 00:11:57.701]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:02.949]  These people are coming for everybody!
[00:12:05.253 --> 00:12:08.175]  We're here at the Pacific Missile Range.
[00:12:08.175 --> 00:12:15.299]  This is the furthest western island, major inhabited island, of the Hawaiian chain, Kauai.
[00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:20.642]  And on the western edge of this, we are standing on the furthest western piece of U.S.
[00:12:20.642 --> 00:12:21.742]  territory.
[00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:25.004]  Just a few thousand miles away is the island of Japan.
[00:12:25.004 --> 00:12:29.267]  And then, of course, North Korea is just southwest of there.
[00:12:29.987 --> 00:12:42.015]  North Korea now has long-range missiles, reportedly, that can hit areas of Alaska and Hawaii, and that are reportedly trained on the island of Kauai, where we're standing here today.
[00:12:42.015 --> 00:12:53.803]  Incredibly fast interceptor missiles, anti-missile missiles, can be fired from this facility at, reportedly, over Mach 5.
[00:12:53.803 --> 00:12:55.764]  Of course, a lot of their speeds are classified.
[00:12:55.764 --> 00:12:58.766]  Some estimations are they have missiles that can go Mach 6, Mach 7.
[00:12:59.887 --> 00:13:04.649]  And then go up and intercept an ICBM or other missile fired from North Korea.
[00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:08.131]  Now, of course, there's also nuclear weapons clearly stationed here.
[00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:14.613]  And down the road, there are missile silos that can fire ICBMs and other systems.
[00:13:14.613 --> 00:13:23.097]  So this is one of the main missile bases protecting the United States, not just from North Korea, but also from Russia and the big threat, Communist China.
[00:13:23.097 --> 00:13:27.839]  And that's why it makes me so angry to see the Clintons calling Trump a traitor.
[00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:32.723]  And saying that he somehow has violated our national security law is made-up crap.
[00:13:32.723 --> 00:13:48.656]  When it's the Clintons in the mid-1990s that transferred, via Laurel and Hughes, the entire system for long-range ICBMs and helped the Communist Chinese get their Long March off the ground and into space and then back into re-entry with the MIRV technology.
[00:13:48.656 --> 00:13:55.622]  So from the launch technology, the guidance, to the re-entry devices, to warhead miniaturization, our government, under the Clintons,
[00:13:55.742 --> 00:13:56.242]  I don't know.
[00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.131]  This is the true real world treason.
[00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:17.191]  And there is no statute of limitations on that.
[00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:22.573]  And that's why Attorney General Sessions needs to go after them for the real crimes they've committed.
[00:14:22.573 --> 00:14:29.975]  As a father of four children, as someone who loves my family but also loves being alive and loves living in a free country, it makes me sick.
[00:14:30.655 --> 00:14:46.550]  To see this leftover of the communist era, this failure, this little pig-like, goblin-like demon, this little nobody, this man-child with nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them because of the globalists, because of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.854]  Even mainstream media admits they literally are responsible for all of it.
[00:14:51.394 --> 00:14:54.576]  These people are a plague upon our country.
[00:14:54.576 --> 00:14:56.777]  They have sold us out to everyone.
[00:14:56.777 --> 00:15:02.020]  They have sold us out to every authoritarian they could because they have kinship with other authoritarians.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.101]  It's their spirit.
[00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:04.321]  They hate America.
[00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:05.182]  They hate Christians.
[00:15:05.182 --> 00:15:06.383]  They hate bitter clingers.
[00:15:06.383 --> 00:15:08.304]  They hate flyover country.
[00:15:08.304 --> 00:15:13.527]  And now our entire nation and the world is in danger of thermal nuclear war because of their evil.
[00:15:14.267 --> 00:15:25.876]  And MSM is somehow blaming Trump for what's happening with Kim Jong-un, a third-generation dictator now threatening to preemptively strike the United States and pushing Trump to move in the next few months.
[00:15:25.876 --> 00:15:32.341]  And I'm betting Trump will move against North Korea because we have no other choice.
[00:15:32.341 --> 00:15:37.345]  Now that report came out yesterday from here in Hawaii and
[00:15:38.732 --> 00:15:41.453]  Since the North Korean dictator has threatened to nuke the U.S.
[00:15:41.453 --> 00:15:46.515]  again, threatened serious retaliation, he has a gun pointed at us.
[00:15:46.515 --> 00:15:50.276]  And the left is just cheering and saying, look, Trump's not doing anything.
[00:15:50.276 --> 00:15:53.017]  As usual, they're cheering for whoever hates the country.
[00:15:53.017 --> 00:15:55.378]  I mean, these people are just pure scum.
[00:15:55.378 --> 00:15:58.519]  We'll be back with the move to make you take microchips to buy and sell.
[00:15:58.519 --> 00:15:59.179]  It's now official.
[00:16:00.131 --> 00:16:03.152]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[00:16:03.152 --> 00:16:07.353]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:16:07.353 --> 00:16:14.035]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:16:14.035 --> 00:16:17.796]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:16:18.516 --> 00:16:38.002]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:16:38.562 --> 00:16:42.686]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:16:42.686 --> 00:16:53.938]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:16:53.938 --> 00:16:59.043]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:16:59.904 --> 00:17:06.408]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:17:06.408 --> 00:17:19.397]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:17:19.397 --> 00:17:23.060]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:29.644]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family
[00:17:30.024 --> 00:17:42.894]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:17:42.894 --> 00:17:44.755]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:17:44.755 --> 00:17:51.140]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.064]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:18:01.024 --> 00:18:02.905]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:18:02.905 --> 00:18:04.925]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:18:04.925 --> 00:18:07.847]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:18:07.847 --> 00:18:13.909]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:23.092]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:18:23.092 --> 00:18:27.954]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:18:28.174 --> 00:18:30.619]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:18:30.619 --> 00:18:38.674]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:18:38.674 --> 00:18:39.756]  The general public doesn't.
[00:18:40.832 --> 00:18:44.773]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:18:44.773 --> 00:18:48.334]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:18:48.334 --> 00:18:55.056]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:18:55.056 --> 00:18:59.137]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[00:19:02.614 --> 00:19:06.436]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:07.937]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[00:19:07.937 --> 00:19:09.637]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[00:19:09.637 --> 00:19:12.079]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:13.279]  It's been sold out for months.
[00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:14.160]  Big waiting list.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.002]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[00:19:18.002 --> 00:19:18.862]  Nobody's got something this
[00:19:18.922 --> 00:19:19.583]  We're good to go.
[00:19:40.685 --> 00:19:42.446]  10% off when you choose auto ship.
[00:19:42.446 --> 00:19:48.328]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have terrible bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago.
[00:19:48.328 --> 00:19:48.908]  Now it's epidemic.
[00:19:48.908 --> 00:19:51.870]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on air and tell you what it did for them.
[00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.271]  Because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:56.592]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:56.592 --> 00:19:57.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.182 --> 00:20:22.064]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[00:20:22.064 --> 00:20:30.867]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[00:20:30.867 --> 00:20:33.548]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:54.213]  Now, I remember being on air 20 years ago, and they had Pentagon studies going on to put brain chips in troops for PTSD.
[00:20:54.213 --> 00:20:57.895]  But it wasn't anything but MIT-type publications.
[00:20:57.895 --> 00:21:06.880]  Now, if you go back about five years ago, there's headlines in the Daily Mail and the New York Times of microchips in the brains of troops may help with PTSD.
[00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.271]  And then my dad's brother was in a motorcycle accident.
[00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:15.854]  He's got a chip that goes up from his neck into his brain whenever he starts to have seizures.
[00:21:15.854 --> 00:21:17.495]  It can kill the seizures.
[00:21:17.495 --> 00:21:19.136]  There's a lot of great things about technology.
[00:21:19.136 --> 00:21:23.998]  There's a lot of great things about so-called cell phones or smartphones.
[00:21:23.998 --> 00:21:28.160]  But it's the Trojan horse stuff that's built into them that's the problem.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.301]  So I would try to have debates about that.
[00:21:30.301 --> 00:21:34.043]  Just like I did about animal-human cloning and chimeras.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.201]  It's the same thing with child pornography.
[00:21:37.201 --> 00:21:43.163]  Child pornography is illegal, but then they have the images of children being raped, and they're saying that's legal.
[00:21:43.163 --> 00:21:47.905]  Well, animals have rights, humans have rights, what about the human animal chimeras?
[00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:51.887]  And you notice the media just makes jokes and says, I'm insane, it doesn't exist.
[00:21:53.114 --> 00:21:54.716]  Because they don't want to have a debate about this now.
[00:21:54.716 --> 00:22:08.472]  They want to culturally through movies and predictive programming, everybody conditioned to accept it, ridicule it ahead of time so that people still are conditioned not to ridicule it, just accept it when it's rolled out.
[00:22:10.202 --> 00:22:12.203]  The sperm counts have dropped globally 60%.
[00:22:12.203 --> 00:22:13.843]  In the West, it's almost 90%.
[00:22:13.843 --> 00:22:19.325]  So you'll have to go get a designer baby made because you can't have a child, which won't even be a real human.
[00:22:19.325 --> 00:22:21.145]  It'll be a humanoid.
[00:22:21.145 --> 00:22:25.766]  These new embryos that have five parents, or it's the new trendy thing to say, oh, we're feminist.
[00:22:25.766 --> 00:22:27.007]  We're two lesbians.
[00:22:27.007 --> 00:22:29.287]  We're having a baby together with our genetics.
[00:22:29.287 --> 00:22:30.448]  That's not even a human.
[00:22:30.448 --> 00:22:32.488]  Like two men together isn't a human.
[00:22:32.488 --> 00:22:33.909]  The genome doesn't even work that way.
[00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:34.589]  It's a humanoid.
[00:22:35.657 --> 00:22:38.099]  They're trying to legalize bringing those to term.
[00:22:38.099 --> 00:22:40.540]  And we're supposed to accept it because it's liberal.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.522]  Kind of like paying for somebody's sex change because it's liberal.
[00:22:43.522 --> 00:22:46.304]  No, it's meant to disrupt society.
[00:22:46.304 --> 00:23:03.315]  So, I told people 20 years ago, hey, it's in establishment social engineering publications that they're even doing the whole body modification movement, and I'm not criticizing your body modification, this is what they said, to prepare the public to accept microchipping.
[00:23:04.653 --> 00:23:06.915]  So it's been going on in the military for a long time.
[00:23:06.915 --> 00:23:17.444]  Then it expanded into places like Mexico, Venezuela, other areas for people that are in the Attorney General's offices or that can be kidnapped.
[00:23:17.444 --> 00:23:24.470]  And it's the basic verichip, digital angel type deal that can be read just like a chip, you know, in your dog or cat's back.
[00:23:25.831 --> 00:23:28.574]  Those are 20, 30-year-old technology.
[00:23:28.574 --> 00:23:40.565]  Well, now they've got firms all over the world, nightclubs, Baja Beach Club in Florida, and companies over in Europe that are saying, if you want to work here, you've got to take a microchip.
[00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:44.808]  But at first, we just incentivize it and pay for it and give you raises.
[00:23:44.808 --> 00:23:45.789]  It's always a party.
[00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:46.870]  It's always fun.
[00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.952]  That's the allegory.
[00:23:50.954 --> 00:23:58.050]  Pinocchio where they first break some things and have fun and have a party and then they all get loaded on slave ships and turn into jackasses.
[00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.994]  An analogy of don't be a jackass, don't be a fool.
[00:24:00.956 --> 00:24:05.738]  Well, this company, 3Square, is a marketing company with 85 employees.
[00:24:05.738 --> 00:24:09.320]  50 of them decided to take the chip and be at the chip party.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.462]  They've got lots of little fun puns.
[00:24:12.462 --> 00:24:21.946]  And again, these are people being paid by the major companies, a particular one in Stockholm, Sweden, can't make that up, to take the chip and be part of the conditioning of the public to accept it.
[00:24:21.946 --> 00:24:29.050]  So now, everything I told you word for word of how they would roll it out and condition you 20 years ago is now fact.
[00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:37.037]  We'll play the report and then I'm going to come back and get into the next level, what's coming after they get you to accept this.
[00:24:37.037 --> 00:24:43.463]  The Cashless Society, total surveillance, total control, one world government in their own words.
[00:24:43.463 --> 00:24:44.765]  So see we're right again.
[00:24:46.468 --> 00:24:52.034]  A woman in Australia is now a combo of Darth Vader and the Terminator, thanks to some special implants.
[00:24:52.034 --> 00:24:54.476]  Here's an x-ray of her hands.
[00:24:54.476 --> 00:24:56.338]  Those circles are microchips.
[00:24:56.338 --> 00:25:00.542]  They allow her to unlock doors without using a key.
[00:25:00.542 --> 00:25:02.604]  Kind of like the Force.
[00:25:02.604 --> 00:25:05.988]  She can also access her computer without a password.
[00:25:08.418 --> 00:25:10.099]  Problem solved.
[00:25:10.099 --> 00:25:16.424]  Many things start off with the best of intentions, but sometimes intentions turn.
[00:25:16.424 --> 00:25:21.168]  We've survived thousands of years as a species without being microchipped.
[00:25:21.168 --> 00:25:23.310]  Is there any particular need to do it now?
[00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:30.636]  Approximately 50 employees at Three Square Market, a vending machine technology company based in River Falls, Wisconsin,
[00:25:30.836 --> 00:25:43.063]  ...have decided to ignore the Book of Revelation's eugenics, the existence of the New World Order, and common sense to gleefully act as guinea pigs for the acceptance of microchip technology.
[00:25:43.063 --> 00:25:50.767]  CNET proudly reports, employees of ThreeSquare won't have to worry about forgetting their employee ID cards at home anymore.
[00:25:51.087 --> 00:26:00.216]  Starting next month, a voluntary program will offer company employees the chance to get an RFID chip implanted in their hands.
[00:26:00.216 --> 00:26:15.531]  The tiny chips will use NFC near-field communication technology to allow employees to unlock doors, make vending machine purchases, log into computers, and access office tools like photocopiers, all with the wave of the hand.
[00:26:15.811 --> 00:26:18.914]  What did the employees say when you brought this idea to them?
[00:26:18.914 --> 00:26:21.878]  Half of them actually within five seconds says yes.
[00:26:21.878 --> 00:26:36.453]  What CNET doesn't tell you is that how long before one of the female employees has a chip implanted resulting in a terminated pregnancy or employees are remotely vaccinated in order to test eugenicist Bill Gates' goals.
[00:26:36.773 --> 00:26:41.260]  But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.266]  This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication.
[00:26:45.266 --> 00:26:49.031]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[00:26:49.031 --> 00:26:51.375]  And that's going to be based on the number of people.
[00:26:52.316 --> 00:27:02.728]  The services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[00:27:02.728 --> 00:27:08.194]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[00:27:08.194 --> 00:27:11.117]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:27:12.245 --> 00:27:14.687]  That's back from high school algebra.
[00:27:14.687 --> 00:27:16.889]  But let's take a look.
[00:27:16.889 --> 00:27:19.111]  First, we've got population.
[00:27:19.111 --> 00:27:21.833]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[00:27:21.833 --> 00:27:24.015]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:27:24.015 --> 00:27:32.281]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:27:33.462 --> 00:27:41.165]  The BBC reports a contraceptive computer chip that can be controlled by remote control has been developed in Massachusetts.
[00:27:41.165 --> 00:27:47.088]  The chip is implanted under a woman's skin releasing a small dose of levonorgestrel, a hormone.
[00:27:47.088 --> 00:27:53.591]  The project has been backed by Bill Gates and will be submitted for pre-clinical testing in the U.S.
[00:27:53.591 --> 00:27:56.392]  next year and possibly go on sale by 2018.
[00:27:56.392 --> 00:28:00.654]  The same technology could be used to administer other drugs
[00:28:00.914 --> 00:28:12.182]  The innovation comes at a time when governments and organizations around the world have agreed to try to bring family planning to around 120 million more women by 2020.
[00:28:12.182 --> 00:28:23.410]  USA Today reports the company, 3Square Market, is partnering with Swedish company Biohax International, which already has many chipped employees.
[00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.750]  Yeah, Wisconsin!
[00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:29.794]  Follow the lead from socialist replacement migration doormat of the West.
[00:28:32.817 --> 00:28:45.368]  It's all about cornering you.
[00:28:45.368 --> 00:28:46.649]  It's all about controlling you.
[00:28:46.649 --> 00:28:48.911]  It's all about taking you out of your natural environment.
[00:28:48.911 --> 00:28:51.653]  It's all about dominating you in their own words.
[00:28:51.653 --> 00:28:54.056]  We've warned you again and it's come true.
[00:28:54.056 --> 00:28:56.398]  Stay with us, we've got more breaking information.
[00:28:59.977 --> 00:29:05.801]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[00:29:05.801 --> 00:29:14.446]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[00:29:14.446 --> 00:29:22.351]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[00:29:22.351 --> 00:29:28.495]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[00:29:28.835 --> 00:29:31.877]  NAR Lipoic Acid, Bio PQQ and many others.
[00:29:31.877 --> 00:29:36.581]  Bio PQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[00:29:36.581 --> 00:29:40.363]  And just one batch of this stuff cost us more than $30,000.
[00:29:40.363 --> 00:29:43.105]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.

[00:30:55.385 --> 00:30:57.466]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.

[00:30:58.967 --> 00:31:01.128]  That's infowarslife.com.
[00:31:01.128 --> 00:31:05.791]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:31:05.791 --> 00:31:13.635]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[00:31:13.695 --> 00:31:13.835]  I think?
[00:31:34.648 --> 00:31:35.328]  We're good.
[00:32:00.979 --> 00:32:10.090]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:18.179]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:18.459 --> 00:32:23.342]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:23.342 --> 00:32:30.146]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:30.146 --> 00:32:37.311]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:37.311 --> 00:32:44.175]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:44.335 --> 00:32:48.818]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:48.818 --> 00:32:52.201]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:32:52.201 --> 00:32:58.505]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:32:58.505 --> 00:33:04.489]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:04.489 --> 00:33:07.131]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.402 --> 00:33:25.266]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:25.266 --> 00:33:26.887]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.411 --> 00:33:39.096]  What's happening is there's a lot of advanced technology that humans have developed, and powerful elites have decided that they're not going to let the public have that.
[00:33:39.096 --> 00:33:54.005]  They're going to keep us busy with games, entertainment, distractions, while they take full control of human development in the future and then begin to cut off resources and dumb the population down towards a mass culling that's coming in the future.
[00:33:54.005 --> 00:33:55.866]  And a lot of people say, well, there are too many poor people.
[00:33:57.068 --> 00:33:59.571]  There are now seven and a half billion people on the earth.
[00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:06.220]  That was five years ago when Bill Gates talked about reducing world population growth down to zero and doing it quote through vaccines.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.302]  We played the clip last hour.
[00:34:08.814 --> 00:34:14.178]  You have to understand, they're targeting everybody except maybe one-tenth of 1%.
[00:34:14.178 --> 00:34:17.981]  People always think it's the 1% that owns everything.
[00:34:17.981 --> 00:34:23.926]  It is less than one-tenth of 1% that has more than half the wealth in the world.
[00:34:23.926 --> 00:34:28.309]  And they're waging war against the 2%, the 1%, the 5%.
[00:34:28.309 --> 00:34:30.091]  They don't want a upper middle class.
[00:34:30.091 --> 00:34:31.712]  They don't want a new wealthy.
[00:34:31.712 --> 00:34:34.374]  They don't want independent millionaires.
[00:34:34.374 --> 00:34:37.276]  And that's what they're establishing is a centralized
[00:34:38.832 --> 00:34:40.272]  Anti-free market system.
[00:34:40.272 --> 00:34:45.354]  Now, you have Loretta Lynch engaged in all these criminal cover-ups for Obama.
[00:34:45.354 --> 00:34:48.035]  The totally open borders outside of law.
[00:34:48.035 --> 00:34:49.735]  Lying to Congress about it.
[00:34:49.735 --> 00:34:50.976]  Funding the Arab Spring.
[00:34:50.976 --> 00:34:51.956]  Funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:34:51.956 --> 00:34:53.216]  Funding Al-Nusra.
[00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:54.216]  Funding ISIS.
[00:34:54.216 --> 00:34:56.177]  Funding the extermination of Christians.
[00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:59.178]  Not letting Christians get in as refugees.
[00:35:00.606 --> 00:35:01.607]  All of this.
[00:35:01.607 --> 00:35:15.637]  Think of the legions of crimes committed by Obama, and the big banks, and the insider deals, and Solyndra, and the energy companies, and the boondoggles, and the kickbacks, and the inside deals that are just legion upon legion.
[00:35:15.637 --> 00:35:17.818]  Legions of legions.
[00:35:17.818 --> 00:35:24.343]  And then finally, Congressman King comes out and says we need a criminal investigation
[00:35:25.313 --> 00:35:30.556]  Of Obama, Clinton, Comey, Lynch, Uma Abedin, and Wiener.
[00:35:30.556 --> 00:35:47.186]  Well, Wiener has hundreds of thousands of emails, and we knew that it was all sorts of reported sex trafficking, procuring children, ties into Jerry Epstein, but they shut it down with just him trying to pick up a 15-year-old girl, because the NYPD had gotten involved in that, and that police report was filed.
[00:35:48.769 --> 00:35:58.074]  So that's why you've had Comey covering all this up and they're using that material for blackmail and control and Trump isn't blackmailable because he doesn't have any of this in his life.
[00:35:58.074 --> 00:36:00.595]  So that's why they're coming after him so much.
[00:36:00.595 --> 00:36:04.397]  It's an army of these type of people and now Congressman King
[00:36:05.177 --> 00:36:08.199]  Has come out and said, we need criminal investigations.
[00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:11.040]  These people, absolutely, there's nothing to the Russia thing.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.921]  That's been proven.
[00:36:11.921 --> 00:36:15.362]  What, his son meeting with somebody that claimed that they had dirt on Hillary?
[00:36:15.362 --> 00:36:17.123]  You're supposed to do that.
[00:36:17.123 --> 00:36:18.504]  That's opposition research.
[00:36:18.504 --> 00:36:29.890]  What Hillary did, getting money for uranium and $100 million for concessions when she was head of the State Department, that's called treason, taking money to sell your country out.
[00:36:31.201 --> 00:36:35.165]  Seriously, I didn't just double down a few weeks ago for Trump Jr.
[00:36:35.165 --> 00:36:37.226]  and say he deserves a medal.
[00:36:37.226 --> 00:36:38.848]  That's what he's supposed to be doing.
[00:36:38.848 --> 00:36:43.092]  His father was right back in July last year, saying, I don't care who's got our illegal emails.
[00:36:43.092 --> 00:36:44.132]  He's the one that did it.
[00:36:44.132 --> 00:36:44.993]  Russia, have you got them?
[00:36:44.993 --> 00:36:46.014]  Release them.
[00:36:46.014 --> 00:36:48.336]  Yeah, Trump didn't do all that.
[00:36:48.336 --> 00:36:49.717]  It's Hillary did that.
[00:36:49.717 --> 00:36:55.683]  I don't care if it's the Easter bunnies got it, or Timbuktu, or a one-horned, one-eyed, flying purple people eater.
[00:36:56.363 --> 00:37:01.528]  So let's go to this powerful clip of Congressman King, who's got some serious huevos.
[00:37:01.528 --> 00:37:04.190]  And you've also got Senator Paulson calling for this.
[00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.592]  You've got Trey Gowdy calling for it.
[00:37:05.592 --> 00:37:12.678]  So you can say Congress is now calling for criminal investigations, not just Congressman Peter King.
[00:37:12.678 --> 00:37:13.079]  Here it is.
[00:37:14.028 --> 00:37:14.568]  We're good to go.
[00:37:44.368 --> 00:38:07.926]  Take his word at the time until you examine the investigation that he conducted of Hillary Clinton all by the way it was a matter is absolutely proven by the facts that he delivered to us in the summary that day and that there is evidence for and I would go on and not only does this trail lead through Hillary Clinton and James Comey but the Loretta Lynch component of this as well when you put this in place and you look at the example of them on the tarmac and
[00:38:08.246 --> 00:38:12.788]  It's hard to imagine they sat there for 38 minutes and discussed grandchildren.
[00:38:12.788 --> 00:38:27.815]  The United States government, borrowing money from China and Saudi Arabia, had handed over somewhere at least $5 million in contracts transferred through USAID into George Soros organizations that were used to manipulate elections in the Balkans.
[00:38:27.815 --> 00:38:32.177]  And that's just particularly Macedonia, not including the neighboring countries that are there.
[00:38:32.517 --> 00:38:38.760]  It's clear that the Obama administration sent their people over to Israel to work against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.201]  Pretty much openly.
[00:38:40.201 --> 00:38:43.403]  Significant dollars invested in that campaign over there.
[00:38:43.403 --> 00:38:55.049]  The President of the United States, with at least the moral support of the people that had worked for him, in the country of Israel, seeking to shift the results of the election against the seated Prime Minister, Bibi Netanyahu.
[00:38:55.049 --> 00:39:01.793]  I would say that the Obama administration is a long ways from clean on this, as far as being involved in elections in other countries.
[00:39:02.353 --> 00:39:07.378]  Not to mention little comments like the British, if you vote Brexit, you're going to have to go to the back of the queue.
[00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:10.460]  So that's the taxpayer dollars piece of this.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:20.309]  And then that brings me to Alexandra Chalupa, who went off, she's a DNC contractor that went off over to Ukraine to try to gather dirt on the Trump people.
[00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:24.133]  So the trail leads, I believe, also to Barack Obama.
[00:39:24.133 --> 00:39:25.534]  We need to investigate all of this.
[00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.750]  By the way, that guy's my new hero.
[00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.411]  He's from Iowa.
[00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:35.492]  I had said Peter King, as there's obviously the Republican congressman from New York.
[00:39:35.492 --> 00:39:35.892]  Peter King.
[00:39:35.892 --> 00:39:45.634]  That is Steve King, not the writer Steve King, who's literally turned into it himself against the Constitution and the Bill of Rights with his anti-Trump garbage.
[00:39:45.634 --> 00:39:49.454]  That is Congressman Steve King of Iowa.
[00:39:49.454 --> 00:39:51.575]  Man, I'd like him to be Vice President next go-around.
[00:39:52.395 --> 00:39:56.737]  Who we need, 100% on target, forcing those issues out.
[00:39:56.737 --> 00:39:58.317]  This is how we're going to defeat these scum.
[00:39:58.317 --> 00:40:03.459]  He's pointing out that everything they say that Trump has done is what they've done.
[00:40:03.459 --> 00:40:09.722]  Now when we come back, I want to get into some really powerful clips dealing with what happened with Obamacare.
[00:40:09.722 --> 00:40:13.944]  Now they're trying to spin this that Trump is a loser because he didn't get it repealed in six months.
[00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:17.505]  They're the losers that passed it and bipartisanly blocked it.
[00:40:19.343 --> 00:40:35.379]  But we're gonna break that down and look at Chuckie Schumer about saying how great McCain was, being the key vote to kill it in the Senate, when McCain had promised when he ran for the Senate again, and said just last year and this year, that he would repeal and replace.
[00:40:35.379 --> 00:40:36.841]  That's why he's so bad.
[00:40:38.038 --> 00:40:47.482]  Because he always does the opposite of what he says, and at key times is the due sex, the guy that comes in and saves the establishment, that saves the globalists.
[00:40:47.482 --> 00:40:53.564]  He is such an anti-gun, open borders, pedophile protecting piece of crap.
[00:40:53.564 --> 00:40:55.885]  I mean, he needs to be investigated.
[00:40:55.885 --> 00:40:56.965]  We don't need to investigate him.
[00:40:56.965 --> 00:40:58.046]  We know all the crimes he's committed.
[00:40:58.046 --> 00:41:03.048]  Hell, he's been bought and paid for since he's sung like a canary in Hanoi Hilton and everything else.
[00:41:04.769 --> 00:41:18.161]  The Keating Five, I mean, this guy is an absolute monster and is in bed with Saudi Arabia, the worst elements, the globalists, the Wahhabists, funding the Arab Spring, I mean, overthrowing our allies, helping get Christians mass-murdered.
[00:41:18.161 --> 00:41:21.083]  I mean, people say pray for him and his brain tumor.
[00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:24.126]  How about you pray for the hundreds of thousands of dead Christians because of him?
[00:41:24.126 --> 00:41:26.148]  Let's pray for them first!
[00:41:26.148 --> 00:41:29.791]  And pray for everybody hurt by Obamacare and the gun control, and then we'll pray for him.
[00:41:31.078 --> 00:41:31.839]  Oh, that's mean.
[00:41:31.839 --> 00:41:34.700]  Okay, well, then he needs to pray for all the kids he killed.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.101]  And then I'll pray for him.
[00:41:36.101 --> 00:41:37.762]  Because I wish no harm upon him.
[00:41:37.762 --> 00:41:39.163]  Believe me, he's got God to deal with.
[00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:40.944]  And you know what God's going to do?
[00:41:40.944 --> 00:41:42.405]  Sooner or later, He's going to cut you down.
[00:41:43.772 --> 00:42:01.561]  Now he's even more Skeletor-like as he stumbles around, you know, trying to exercise his power as his fingernails tenuously hold on to this plane of existence and as the great mouth of hell rises up stinking with a fetid flesh ready to swallow him into its maw.
[00:42:01.561 --> 00:42:06.784]  Now, please don't forget we're running huge specials that end on Tuesday.

[00:42:55.174 --> 00:43:10.162]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking such steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction, to wit, by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence.
[00:43:10.342 --> 00:43:17.729]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[00:43:17.729 --> 00:43:19.711]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[00:43:19.711 --> 00:43:25.957]  We now live in a neo-feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[00:43:25.957 --> 00:43:33.304]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[00:43:33.464 --> 00:43:41.269]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[00:43:41.269 --> 00:43:49.554]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[00:43:49.554 --> 00:43:56.979]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[00:43:56.979 --> 00:43:59.341]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com
[00:44:00.165 --> 00:44:03.187]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[00:44:03.187 --> 00:44:07.389]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:44:07.389 --> 00:44:14.073]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:44:14.073 --> 00:44:17.836]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:44:18.556 --> 00:44:38.042]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:44:38.602 --> 00:44:42.726]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:44:42.726 --> 00:44:53.957]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:44:53.957 --> 00:44:59.082]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.

[00:45:31.089 --> 00:45:39.816]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.

[00:47:37.168 --> 00:47:39.851]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:39.851 --> 00:47:53.525]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:47:53.525 --> 00:47:54.006]  Welcome back!
[00:47:55.643 --> 00:47:57.344]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:47:57.344 --> 00:48:01.267]  We are going to broadcast right into the next hour.
[00:48:01.267 --> 00:48:04.989]  And I intend to give the toll-free number out today for first-time callers.
[00:48:04.989 --> 00:48:08.031]  And we'll start the second hour here in about 15 minutes.
[00:48:09.775 --> 00:48:17.359]  And I will give you that toll-free number as well, again, coming up when we start the next hour to talk about the North Korea situation.
[00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:18.540]  What should Trump do?
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.760]  What should we do?
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.142]  To talk about the Obamacare failure to repeal.
[00:48:22.142 --> 00:48:25.844]  Are you blaming Trump like the media is telling you to?
[00:48:25.844 --> 00:48:28.285]  What do you make of all these companies coming out?
[00:48:28.285 --> 00:48:32.147]  It's a new one I see every few weeks saying, you want to work here, you got to take a microchip.
[00:48:32.147 --> 00:48:35.349]  And it's being pushed by big multinational corporations.
[00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:37.110]  What do you make of all this?
[00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:38.511]  You know, I saw a big sickening
[00:48:39.798 --> 00:48:57.025]  Editorial today in National Review that basically draws parallels between between Glenn Leary, Glenn Ross, famous play made into a movie with Alec Baldwin and others.
[00:48:57.025 --> 00:49:08.509]  And it's a powerful film, but it has no context when you're talking about President Trump and the failure of Obamacare, the failure to repeal Obamacare.
[00:49:09.724 --> 00:49:19.268]  Because it was Obama and the bipartisan Republican and Democratic group that ran through that screwjob six and a half years ago.
[00:49:19.268 --> 00:49:25.991]  And they kept delaying its implementation because it was such a monstrous, painful fraud.
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:46.204]  And they wanted you to forget that they told you that your health care would be free, and then that it would be the cost of your cable bill, or that you could keep your doctor, or all the rest of it, when it was designed by big multinational corporations to make you buy a product and then drive the price up, which they indeed have done.
[00:49:46.204 --> 00:49:50.324]  So, that's the reality of what happened.
[00:49:50.324 --> 00:49:53.725]  But now the media is branding, like you're an idiot, I don't think you're an idiot,
[00:49:55.290 --> 00:50:00.336]  Obamacare is Trump's fault that they went through four different versions.
[00:50:00.336 --> 00:50:07.064]  The one thing Trump ever did that wasn't that good was go along with the first version that was better than Obamacare.
[00:50:07.064 --> 00:50:10.167]  This way it wouldn't stall the economy but was still somewhat of a screw job.
[00:50:10.167 --> 00:50:15.474]  That's one of the few bad things Trump's done in his six months and two weeks in office.
[00:50:17.042 --> 00:50:19.664]  He's gotten so much done it makes my head spin.
[00:50:19.664 --> 00:50:29.110]  Just getting elected against the media and all the foreign countries and the Pope and Mexico and the Communist Chinese and Hollywood is a huge victory.
[00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:30.390]  He's such a winner.
[00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:33.632]  Then TPP repealing that.
[00:50:33.632 --> 00:50:36.494]  I mean, what a monstrous international takeover.
[00:50:36.494 --> 00:50:45.140]  And the carbon tax, the whole world government funding system and 69% of the illegals not coming across now compared to this time last year.
[00:50:46.325 --> 00:50:48.206]  From Homeland Security's own numbers.
[00:50:48.206 --> 00:50:49.788]  Incredible!
[00:50:49.788 --> 00:50:54.151]  And it goes on and on and on, and he's trying to get the economy to un-stall.
[00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:57.413]  So here comes the Federal Reserve.
[00:50:57.413 --> 00:51:00.616]  By an act of Congress outside the President's control.
[00:51:00.616 --> 00:51:03.298]  Raising interest rates, what is it, four or five times now?
[00:51:03.298 --> 00:51:06.060]  Admittedly trying to kill the Trump recovery.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.802]  Betting against America, the arrogance, the insolence.
[00:51:10.131 --> 00:51:30.563]  It's just too much, and then they blame Trump in the so-called Republican media, and Fox News is blaming him, because for them to be able to sell Sky Television for $40-something billion, they need to, with the regulators, not be part of any political or right-wing media worldwide.
[00:51:30.563 --> 00:51:36.087]  So that's why Fox is going completely left, is they want to sell Sky, and the Suns are taking it over.
[00:51:36.087 --> 00:51:37.708]  But it is just sick.
[00:51:38.717 --> 00:51:45.119]  To see them insulting my intelligence, your intelligence, and saying Trump's to blame?
[00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:59.602]  Finally getting a fourth version that Rand Paul said was good and would save the economy and save healthcare prices and bring back competition and bring back choice and still cover people that aren't insured with Medicare and Medicaid?
[00:51:59.602 --> 00:52:01.382]  Incredible!
[00:52:01.382 --> 00:52:04.523]  Ron Paul says, yes, this is a good plan compared to everything else.
[00:52:04.523 --> 00:52:05.743]  Good job, Trump.
[00:52:05.743 --> 00:52:07.364]  And McCain, who swore
[00:52:08.049 --> 00:52:09.773]  That he would be against it.
[00:52:09.773 --> 00:52:14.424]  That he would fight Obamacare and that he would support the repeal.
[00:52:14.424 --> 00:52:16.789]  He comes in at the last minute and votes to keep it.
[00:52:18.032 --> 00:52:21.634]  With a massive screw job and the media goes, oh, he's got the last laugh.
[00:52:21.634 --> 00:52:22.494]  He beat Trump.
[00:52:22.494 --> 00:52:23.735]  He made Trump look weak.
[00:52:23.735 --> 00:52:24.415]  Wow!
[00:52:24.415 --> 00:52:27.337]  And screwed over a bunch of consumers.
[00:52:27.337 --> 00:52:31.959]  Tens of millions of people who've seen their premiums double, triple, or more.
[00:52:31.959 --> 00:52:33.860]  And have their doctors taken away.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:46.786]  And then, you have the headline, in the sickening, failed, government propped up, neocon national review, death of an effing salesman.
[00:52:48.769 --> 00:52:52.254]  Death of an Effings Talesman.
[00:52:52.254 --> 00:52:56.379]  Which I guess is the original name of Glenn Leary, Glenn Ross, or whatever the play.
[00:52:56.379 --> 00:53:00.004]  And it goes into how he's a con, he's a fraud, he never did anything in his life.
[00:53:00.004 --> 00:53:00.905]  Oh no!
[00:53:00.905 --> 00:53:04.890]  Outside the system, he built his own hotels, golf courses, and casinos.
[00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:05.872]  Nobody's done that.
[00:53:06.852 --> 00:53:13.357]  Outside of the system, he was successful battling the system from the grassroots of New York on his own.
[00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:14.498]  He's a fighter.
[00:53:14.498 --> 00:53:20.623]  And then he gets elected, an uphill fight for president, and he's delivered like no one I've ever seen in modern history in six months.
[00:53:20.623 --> 00:53:23.946]  It's dizzying how good it is compared to what we would have with Hillary.
[00:53:24.679 --> 00:53:34.244]  And then they turn around in an echo chamber with Fox News, National Review, and CNN, MSNBC, and say, oh, a devastating defeat for the ultimate salesman, the guy that never fails.
[00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:35.724]  Trump never said he never fails.
[00:53:35.724 --> 00:53:38.085]  He's failed many times, but always gets back up.
[00:53:38.085 --> 00:53:41.187]  But out of hundreds of companies, he's only declared bankruptcy on four.
[00:53:41.187 --> 00:53:46.009]  That's what you do when you launch a new company, a new system, a new program.
[00:53:46.009 --> 00:53:49.931]  You create new corporations that it operates in, new people, new employees.
[00:53:49.931 --> 00:53:52.052]  And then if that succeeds, it's its own thing.
[00:53:52.052 --> 00:53:53.653]  But if it implodes, you cut it off.
[00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:57.092]  70 plus percent of new businesses go under.
[00:53:57.092 --> 00:54:01.716]  Trump's had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and four have failed.
[00:54:01.716 --> 00:54:06.460]  And they make fun of the fact he sold ties and clothes and steaks.
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.802]  Just like they make fun of me for selling supplements and t-shirts.
[00:54:08.802 --> 00:54:11.964]  See, everybody else can sell things, just not us.
[00:54:11.964 --> 00:54:13.786]  See, when we do, it's dirty.
[00:54:13.786 --> 00:54:14.927]  When we do, it's bad.
[00:54:16.897 --> 00:54:28.870]  So these are the mind games they're playing and the losers are National Review that created Never Trumpism and put everything they could into destroying Trump and sabotaging and trying to take his nomination away and then trying to take the electors away.
[00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:34.015]  But they failed so they call him a loser because they're calling you a loser.
[00:54:34.015 --> 00:54:36.378]  And they cite all the fake polls that he's done in polls.
[00:54:37.622 --> 00:54:40.346]  Yeah, just like he was 15 points behind in all those states he won.
[00:54:40.346 --> 00:54:42.209]  It's a load of baloney.
[00:54:42.209 --> 00:54:43.390]  And they think you're stupid.
[00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:46.094]  But what's being tested here is, are we smart?
[00:54:46.094 --> 00:54:47.456]  Or are we hoaxable anymore?
[00:54:47.456 --> 00:54:48.217]  Are we smart?
[00:54:48.217 --> 00:54:50.080]  Or are we stupid?
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.103]  The evidence shows we're getting smarter.
[00:54:52.103 --> 00:54:53.285]  We're learning their tricks.
[00:54:53.285 --> 00:54:54.186]  We're understanding.
[00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:58.091]  We're not invested in Trump because of the person.
[00:54:58.091 --> 00:55:04.012]  We're invested in the fact that he's a focal point to restore the republic and it's working.
[00:55:04.012 --> 00:55:05.033]  But it's a serious fight.
[00:55:05.033 --> 00:55:10.134]  And it's a fight we may lose if you don't take action, if you don't speak out, if you don't get involved.
[00:55:16.676 --> 00:55:17.576]  877-789-2539.
[00:55:17.576 --> 00:55:26.440]  Infowars.com is the news website demonized, attacked by enemies of freedom and enemies of free market everywhere.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:34.244]  And spreading that link is an act of absolute savage resistance, loving to your family, hateful towards the New World Order.
[00:55:34.244 --> 00:55:45.609]  Our resistance will never falter or waver as long as you breathe breath and take action and put God first and take action against these scumbags that use hype and use fear and use peer pressure to control.
[00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:49.992]  Now, let me play a clip, and I've got more of these clips coming up.
[00:55:49.992 --> 00:55:58.297]  We've got a clip of Schumer praising John McCain for shooting down the repeal of Obamacare.
[00:55:58.297 --> 00:55:59.878]  Not pointing out he pledged to repeal it.
[00:55:59.878 --> 00:56:03.320]  Here it is.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.121]  John McCain at the top of the list.
[00:56:05.121 --> 00:56:08.463]  He and I have been friends for a very long time.
[00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:14.535]  Ever since the Gang of Eight, which we put together.
[00:56:14.535 --> 00:56:24.562]  And I have not seen a senator who speaks truth to power as strongly, as well, and as frequently as John McCain.
[00:56:24.562 --> 00:56:35.670]  The very same courage he showed as a naval aviator in Vietnam, he showed last night, and has shown time and time again.
[00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:37.431]  He's just a wonderful man.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:43.404]  I treasure his friendship and just the fact of knowing him.
[00:56:43.404 --> 00:56:46.807]  I've known a few great men in the Senate.
[00:56:46.807 --> 00:56:54.394]  I'd put Ted Kennedy in that category and Danny Inouye, and I'd put John McCain in that category too.
[00:56:54.394 --> 00:57:02.802]  And certainly not to be forgotten of equal praise are Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.
[00:57:02.802 --> 00:57:03.483]  They were amazing.
[00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:08.251]  And women are, in so many instances, stronger than men.
[00:57:08.251 --> 00:57:11.632]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, they call him their chairman, the Democrats do.
[00:57:11.632 --> 00:57:13.473]  He's literally the leader of the Democratic Party.
[00:57:13.473 --> 00:57:14.673]  John McCanis!
[00:57:14.673 --> 00:57:17.934]  I think it's archetypal that he's got a brain tumor, or had it removed.
[00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:22.816]  And I think it's archetypal that you got David Rockefeller dying, and Zbigniew Brzezinski dying this year.
[00:57:22.816 --> 00:57:29.338]  I just hope everybody realizes these people are literal demons out to get you.
[00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:35.575]  Now we've got McCain when we come back, pledging that he would repeal Obamacare, period.
[00:57:35.575 --> 00:57:36.136]  One way or another.
[00:57:36.136 --> 00:57:40.161]  And of course he betrayed you as a Judas Iscariot always does.
[00:57:40.161 --> 00:57:48.432]  He's a lying, stinking, Islamist piece of garbage just like that creature Brennan that says they need to overthrow Trump violently.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.521]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:57:52.521 --> 00:57:53.841]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:57:53.841 --> 00:57:55.061]  Why is this so good?
[00:57:55.061 --> 00:58:00.343]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:58:00.343 --> 00:58:13.887]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:58:13.887 --> 00:58:15.248]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:58:16.028 --> 00:58:17.669]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:58:17.669 --> 00:58:20.251]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:58:20.251 --> 00:58:21.552]  These are all parasites.
[00:58:21.552 --> 00:58:22.652]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:58:22.652 --> 00:58:23.993]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:58:23.993 --> 00:58:28.496]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:58:28.496 --> 00:58:31.658]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:58:31.658 --> 00:58:34.840]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:35.901]  It just came back in yesterday.

[00:59:43.906 --> 00:59:44.266]  I got it!
[01:00:12.699 --> 01:00:14.440]  Watch me!
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.001]  I got it!
[01:00:16.001 --> 01:00:17.562]  Hey!
[01:00:17.562 --> 01:00:21.104]  I got something that makes me wanna shout!
[01:00:21.104 --> 01:00:26.167]  I got something that tells me what it's all about!
[01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:27.108]  I got soul!
[01:00:27.108 --> 01:00:28.969]  And I'm super bad!
[01:00:28.969 --> 01:00:30.570]  I got soul!
[01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:33.692]  You know the message is?
[01:00:33.692 --> 01:00:35.273]  This healthcare bill?
[01:00:35.273 --> 01:00:36.834]  Repeal and replace!
[01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:38.335]  Repeal and replace!
[01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:40.456]  Repeal and replace!
[01:00:40.456 --> 01:00:41.617]  Repeal and replace!
[01:00:43.337 --> 01:00:47.700]  Repeal and replace.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:53.824]  And if you don't, and then if you don't, we're going to repeal them.
[01:00:53.824 --> 01:00:59.927]  So that's John McCain last year saying repeal and replace, taking Trump's words away from him.
[01:00:59.927 --> 01:01:06.832]  And then as soon as he had a chance to shoot down the bill that was the best one we've seen yet, according to Senator Rand Paul.
[01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:10.297]  To save the economy, to save our healthcare system.
[01:01:10.297 --> 01:01:13.981]  Elizabeth Warren admitted, you can just type this into a search engine, last week.
[01:01:13.981 --> 01:01:21.348]  She said last week, and then she said it two weeks ago, is designed to destroy healthcare as we know it and bring in a single payer, but with corporations that you have to pay.
[01:01:21.348 --> 01:01:23.290]  So it's even worse than socialism.
[01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:27.073]  It's like fascism, but under a socialist model.
[01:01:27.073 --> 01:01:31.978]  So, he pledged, of course, to do that, and then he screwed you over.
[01:01:33.328 --> 01:01:41.972]  And the media is just creamy-eyed right now in a celebration of the quote, defeat of Trump.
[01:01:41.972 --> 01:01:44.753]  They're the monsters that created this legislation.
[01:01:44.753 --> 01:01:47.415]  They're the ones that are cowards and won't get rid of it.
[01:01:47.415 --> 01:01:49.756]  They're the ones that will be held responsible by the voters.
[01:01:49.756 --> 01:01:52.277]  The voters may be distracted and some of them may be dumb.
[01:01:53.373 --> 01:02:04.597]  But even mainline Democrats seeing their health care go up and working families across this country know they've been lied to and they know Trump didn't create Obamacare and they know Trump's trying to get the economy going.
[01:02:04.597 --> 01:02:08.918]  So there's a lot of basic self-preservation going on out there.
[01:02:08.918 --> 01:02:14.700]  The main problem that MSM has and will continue to have over the years
[01:02:17.113 --> 01:02:23.397]  Is that when they put out these fake polls, even when they don't show the methodology, when they do, you always see them adding 9, 15, 20 points or more.
[01:02:23.397 --> 01:02:27.859]  You can only lower polls so long.
[01:02:27.859 --> 01:02:29.700]  You can't just keep, keep, keep lowering.
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:33.602]  Nobody believes that Trump's got a 35% approval rate.
[01:02:33.602 --> 01:02:37.645]  And they know that there's elections coming up that'll prove their polls wrong.
[01:02:37.645 --> 01:02:45.249]  So now that it's still three years out, until Trump's facing full re-election, it will be an election season in two years, but
[01:02:47.381 --> 01:02:50.804]  They're creeping back with the fake polls again, and it's just what they do.
[01:02:50.804 --> 01:03:11.000]  And we know from industry bots, and the same numbers that any major company that subscribes to all these numbers can do, that the likability numbers of Trump are as high as they've been the last three years, except for the week after the inauguration.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.001]  Very, very high then.
[01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:24.225]  It was another time it was very, very high, almost as high, and that was back during the Republican National Convention when he got the nomination.
[01:03:24.225 --> 01:03:25.666]  It was very, very high there.
[01:03:25.666 --> 01:03:31.211]  Some internal polls were showing him 20 points ahead of Hillary then.
[01:03:31.211 --> 01:03:36.776]  That's why I kept saying he's going to win, because of course he was 20 points ahead.
[01:03:36.776 --> 01:03:40.179]  Why do you think CNN was having to add 15 points on to Hillary?
[01:03:41.954 --> 01:03:43.895]  Because he was 15, 20 points ahead.
[01:03:43.895 --> 01:03:47.638]  They wanted to show her ahead of him.
[01:03:47.638 --> 01:03:51.160]  So it's, again, who they call, who they poll, who they reach out to.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:57.705]  Most of CNN polls are phone polls where you call CNN and then they decide to mark down who called in.
[01:03:57.705 --> 01:04:02.608]  And again, in some polls, they oversampled 34% more Democrat callers.
[01:04:07.288 --> 01:04:10.631]  I mean, but they put it in the methodology.
[01:04:10.631 --> 01:04:22.840]  Well, I could have a methodology saying for headache, like trephiny, where I take a hatchet and hack myself in the head like, you know, the ancients drilled holes in their heads and let the evil spirits out.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.681]  I mean, that's a methodology for brain surgery.
[01:04:24.681 --> 01:04:25.502]  It doesn't mean it's real.
[01:04:26.966 --> 01:04:33.452]  I could sit there and throw a cat in boiling water and boil it and drink it and think I had superpowers, because I was taking hemlock.
[01:04:33.452 --> 01:04:35.974]  Because I was hallucinating.
[01:04:35.974 --> 01:04:42.720]  I mean, just because CNN throws feces up against the wall and then has to read what it says and says Trump's going to lose, that means it's true.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:49.767]  Let me tell you, the Romans would cut the guts out of like oxen and things and read their entrails for chickens.
[01:04:49.767 --> 01:04:52.089]  And I'm telling you, that's more accurate than CNN's polls.
[01:04:53.376 --> 01:04:59.156]  Wolf Blitzer can sit there and throw his own feces up against the wall and that would give us more information than their polls.
[01:05:00.888 --> 01:05:06.593]  Rediscover your fire with the EcoZoom Coal Rocket Camping Stove.

[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:10.682]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[01:06:10.682 --> 01:06:12.643]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:14.176 --> 01:06:30.676]  Sometimes I feel I've got to run away, I've got to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me, the love we share seems to go
[01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:44.486]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live a little bit late getting
[01:06:56.476 --> 01:06:56.897]  Thank you so much.
[01:07:06.974 --> 01:07:11.615]  has kicked out 755 US diplomats.
[01:07:11.615 --> 01:07:25.538]  This is being done a little less than a year after the United States kicked out that many and actually took several diplomatic Russian compounds on the East Coast in DC and New York, took those away from the Russians.
[01:07:25.538 --> 01:07:31.619]  So there's not been a thawing of some of the worst relations since the Cuban Missile Crisis with Russia.
[01:07:32.807 --> 01:07:36.910]  Despite the fact that there's no evidence Russia actually meddled in our elections or hacked anything.
[01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:38.651]  We caught the DNC doing it.
[01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:42.013]  In five states they stole, six other states they tried to rob.
[01:07:42.013 --> 01:07:44.654]  I'm not here defending Russia.
[01:07:44.654 --> 01:07:54.180]  It's just Russia hasn't done anything to us other than work with the Pentagon to take out Al Qaeda and ISIS in the last five years back when Obama and others were actually backing it.
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.021]  So, absolutely amazing.
[01:07:56.021 --> 01:07:56.822]  More than 750 American diplomats
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:03.461]  We'll have to leave Russia as a result of Washington's own policies.
[01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:13.564]  Russian President Vladimir Putin had said in an exclusive interview with the, I don't want to pronounce it wrong, R-O-S-S-I-Y-A-1 TV channel.
[01:08:13.564 --> 01:08:20.686]  The American side has made a move, which is important to note, and it just continues on from there.
[01:08:20.686 --> 01:08:21.526]  Get them on the road.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:27.823]  Important to note, hasn't been provoked by anything to worsen Russian-U.S.
[01:08:27.823 --> 01:08:28.323]  relations.
[01:08:28.323 --> 01:08:39.531]  It includes unlawful restrictions, attempts to influence other states in the world, including our allies, who are interested in developing and keeping relations with Russia, Putin told the channel's host.
[01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:40.965]  And it goes on.
[01:08:40.965 --> 01:08:45.086]  We've been waiting for quite a long time that maybe something would change for the better.
[01:08:45.086 --> 01:08:49.988]  We had hopes that the situation would change, but it looks like it's not going to change in the near future.
[01:08:49.988 --> 01:08:54.689]  I've decided that it's the time for us to show that we will not leave anything unanswered.
[01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:58.590]  The Russian President added earlier this week, following the U.S.
[01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:08.413]  Congress approval of new sanctions against Russia, Iran, North Korea, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Moscow told Washington to reduce the number of diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people.
[01:09:09.713 --> 01:09:10.274]  The number of U.S.
[01:09:10.274 --> 01:09:16.820]  diplomatic service staff in Russia was ordered to be reduced in order to equal the number of Russian diplomats in the U.S.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.742]  by September 1st.
[01:09:18.742 --> 01:09:23.847]  They went on to say, as of now, I greatly exceeds the number of Russian embassy staff and the U.S.
[01:09:23.847 --> 01:09:29.332]  ministry said the American diplomatic mission includes more than 1,200 personnel.
[01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:32.595]  And again, China, the EU,
[01:09:34.369 --> 01:09:48.040]  The Vatican, some of the Gulf states, allied with other socialist states like Venezuela, Cuba, and others, are all allied against the United States and Russia.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:59.449]  And that's because the United States and Russia are big, land-rich, mineral-rich countries that the globalists have had previous total control over, but
[01:10:00.327 --> 01:10:07.637]  We are now breaking away from this multinational combine that's tax-exempt and has diplomatic immunity.
[01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:13.525]  And people are aware now of how outrageous this is and that they've actually gotten away with all of this.
[01:10:15.285 --> 01:10:42.943]  But again, once you expose globalism, once people know it's unelected, once people know what its plans are, once they know that it wants to use austerity and poverty to control everybody, keep the third world poor, use third world populations to drive down wages in the first world, use those populations through race baiting and tribalism in a divide and conquer, Balkanization's great game strategy, so the elites can basically build armored
[01:10:44.687 --> 01:10:56.998]  Compounds and far away high-tech breakaway civilizations from Tasmania to Hawaii, hoping that they're going to escape the plan that they've set up.
[01:10:56.998 --> 01:11:00.081]  And really what it is is they're losers.
[01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:03.765]  It's much easier to control demolition.
[01:11:05.535 --> 01:11:17.708]  It's much easier to just come in and take things over and blow them up and implode them and then say it's some master plan you've got and that you were really doing it by design when you're really just a selfish person and are part of a selfish combine.
[01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:32.195]  The truth is the globalists don't want to have to manage things, don't want to have to create more resources, don't want to have to compete with new technologies that are coming out, and they fear the incredible cutting-edge renaissance that they've already been suppressing for 50 years.
[01:11:32.195 --> 01:11:41.799]  It is a fact that the technology and information we have is billions and billions of times greater conservatively than what it was 5,000 years ago.
[01:11:43.203 --> 01:11:53.733]  We already have incredible technology, incredible understanding, but that technology has been used as a control system and we've been lazy so that we're becoming very, very
[01:11:55.410 --> 01:12:04.814]  Decadent, like the fictional characters that weigh 600 pounds in the movie WALL-E, that are just up there in this AI cruise ship outside the Earth they've destroyed.
[01:12:04.814 --> 01:12:07.595]  They're on an Elysium, and the computers aren't evil.
[01:12:07.595 --> 01:12:09.856]  The AI wasn't bad overall.
[01:12:09.856 --> 01:12:17.018]  It just basically followed its order to keep everybody basically under its full control and completely nanny-state servile.
[01:12:17.018 --> 01:12:19.979]  And that's where all this is going, except it's not an accident.
[01:12:19.979 --> 01:12:23.661]  The Globeless admit it's a plan for full and total control.
[01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:27.343]  So when we come back, we will go to calls.
[01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:30.345]  I hadn't thought to punch up the phone system until right now, so that's my fault.
[01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:32.227]  But I'm glad we've got those punched up now.
[01:12:32.227 --> 01:12:35.369]  So when we come back from break, I'll be able to go to J.K.
[01:12:35.369 --> 01:12:39.792]  and David and Frank and Jim and Alex and Sean and others.
[01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:41.173]  Speaking of J.K., J.K.
[01:12:41.173 --> 01:12:46.538]  Rowling has come out and routinely attacks Paul Joseph Watson, calling him a racist with no evidence.
[01:12:46.538 --> 01:12:48.519]  She's the one that has giant palaces.
[01:12:48.519 --> 01:12:50.420]  I'm talking like six or seven of them just in England.
[01:12:51.261 --> 01:12:52.882]  And in Tasmania, speaking of the devil.
[01:12:52.882 --> 01:12:54.963]  Oh, and in Hawaii, too, I was reading.
[01:12:54.963 --> 01:12:56.343]  And she was taken in one refugee.
[01:12:56.343 --> 01:12:58.724]  She's worth like five million dollars.
[01:12:58.724 --> 01:13:01.245]  She was taken in one refugee.
[01:13:01.245 --> 01:13:09.628]  But she came out and criticized Paul when he pointed out the BBC's teaching kids in cartoons that Romans in England and in Rome were black.
[01:13:09.628 --> 01:13:11.829]  They were black.
[01:13:11.829 --> 01:13:13.070]  And pretty soon it'll be like the pyramids.
[01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:16.111]  People will just believe that Rome was built by black folks.
[01:13:16.111 --> 01:13:17.191]  Nothing against black people.
[01:13:17.191 --> 01:13:18.892]  I mean, my ancestors didn't build Rome.
[01:13:20.078 --> 01:13:22.119]  Yeah, that's the Italians.
[01:13:22.119 --> 01:13:24.600]  But I mean, that's what they're teaching now.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.862]  And pretty soon it's like, yeah, whites had nothing to do with Egypt either.
[01:13:27.862 --> 01:13:32.384]  They've done all the DNA testing and it was founded by Southern and Central Europeans.
[01:13:32.384 --> 01:13:34.185]  I mean, that's just a fact.
[01:13:34.185 --> 01:13:36.586]  But again, this is how this works.
[01:13:36.586 --> 01:13:39.447]  So pretty soon it'll be, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:13:39.447 --> 01:13:42.288]  Yeah, you didn't know Britons were all black.
[01:13:42.288 --> 01:13:42.909]  And then J.K.
[01:13:42.909 --> 01:13:47.471]  Rowling comes out and attacks him when he points that out and says, isn't this horrible?
[01:13:49.181 --> 01:13:53.063]  Again, 30 years ago people said it's crazy, I'm not paying for your sex change.
[01:13:53.063 --> 01:13:54.744]  You're like, you're hateful, pay for my sex change.
[01:13:54.744 --> 01:13:57.926]  Whether you believe in the sex change or not, I shouldn't have to pay for it.
[01:13:57.926 --> 01:14:00.028]  That's the same thing with like bringing in all these radical Muslims.
[01:14:00.028 --> 01:14:01.929]  None of these people want to take them in themselves.
[01:14:01.929 --> 01:14:11.395]  They want to rain them down on the rest of civilization as a destabilizing event because the globalists manage the crisis management systems and use the crises they create
[01:14:12.759 --> 01:14:18.531]  And they exacerbate, just like Rahm Emanuel said, we don't let a good crisis go to waste, to bring in more control.
[01:14:18.531 --> 01:14:19.894]  And this is their methodology.
[01:14:20.603 --> 01:14:24.906]  And Trump and Nigel Farage and others do not want that.
[01:14:24.906 --> 01:14:27.127]  We want the old prosperity-based system.
[01:14:27.127 --> 01:14:31.570]  We want the forbidden disruptive technologies, as they call them, released.
[01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:35.632]  We want them deployed to basically open free market bidding.
[01:14:35.632 --> 01:14:41.636]  We want a lot of the public lands, 80 plus percent in many areas out west, as high as 90 percent, are under federal control.
[01:14:41.636 --> 01:14:44.457]  They're very imperious, very arrogant.
[01:14:44.457 --> 01:14:48.000]  We want that transferred back to the people.
[01:14:49.173 --> 01:14:51.194]  And it just needs to happen.
[01:14:51.194 --> 01:14:52.254]  And it needs to happen now.
[01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:54.535]  That's what's going to innovate and get us off the planet.
[01:14:54.535 --> 01:14:57.796]  We've gotten to this point with some dirty technologies.
[01:14:57.796 --> 01:15:04.899]  But the globalists claim they're bringing in all these new clean technologies and things like windmills and things when that's just boondoggles to their friends.
[01:15:04.899 --> 01:15:06.480]  They're suppressing real technologies.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.482]  They're diverting us with fake environmental crises like carbon dioxide that is one of the four
[01:15:12.242 --> 01:15:13.423]  We're good to go.
[01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:35.935]  So again, this is the reality.
[01:15:35.935 --> 01:15:39.717]  Your phone call's coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:15:39.717 --> 01:15:40.458]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:40.458 --> 01:15:56.967]  I've got a bunch of other clips I haven't gotten to as well that deal with the incredible criminal activity of foreign IT operations being given direct control of the DNC and congressional servers.
[01:15:56.967 --> 01:15:59.589]  Part of the overall globalist plan to sabotage this country.
[01:16:01.172 --> 01:16:04.935]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:12.680]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:21.286]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:16:21.286 --> 01:16:31.012]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:32.412]  We're good to go.
[01:16:59.989 --> 01:17:08.257]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:09.458]  A 360 win.
[01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:16.024]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:17:16.024 --> 01:17:23.551]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:17:23.951 --> 01:17:28.614]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:17:28.614 --> 01:17:35.118]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:42.922]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:17:42.922 --> 01:17:50.126]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:17:50.126 --> 01:17:50.927]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:17:51.087 --> 01:17:53.530]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:55.512]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:17:55.512 --> 01:17:59.356]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:18:01.551 --> 01:18:07.196]  Today, I'm excited to announce the new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[01:18:07.196 --> 01:18:15.863]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products at DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[01:18:15.863 --> 01:18:23.769]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[01:18:23.769 --> 01:18:29.914]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[01:18:30.254 --> 01:18:33.295]  NAR, lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[01:18:33.295 --> 01:18:37.997]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[01:18:37.997 --> 01:18:41.759]  And just one batch of this stuff cost us more than $30,000.
[01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:44.500]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:52.623]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third-party certified review agency, Power Review.
[01:18:52.623 --> 01:18:58.185]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com before it sells out again.
[01:18:58.185 --> 01:18:59.346]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:01.263 --> 01:19:03.165]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:19:03.165 --> 01:19:05.168]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:19:05.168 --> 01:19:08.091]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:14.158]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:19:14.158 --> 01:19:21.527]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[01:19:21.647 --> 01:19:23.328]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:19:23.328 --> 01:19:30.873]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:19:30.873 --> 01:19:38.898]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:19:38.898 --> 01:19:39.859]  The general public doesn't.
[01:19:41.071 --> 01:19:45.012]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:19:45.012 --> 01:19:48.572]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:19:48.572 --> 01:19:55.294]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:19:55.294 --> 01:20:03.855]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:20:03.855 --> 01:20:06.496]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:16.832]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:16.832 --> 01:20:22.354]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:22.354 --> 01:20:25.296]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:20:28.534 --> 01:20:29.555]  Absolutely!
[01:20:29.555 --> 01:20:30.916]  I'm Owen Schroer, your host.
[01:20:30.916 --> 01:20:32.357]  Hi!
[01:20:32.357 --> 01:20:33.237]  Hey, you know what?
[01:20:33.237 --> 01:20:35.198]  We actually have Owen Schroer starting his own show.
[01:20:35.198 --> 01:20:40.462]  I'm glad they actually ran that liner, because we're going to have Owen Schroer.
[01:20:40.462 --> 01:20:41.382]  I heard that coming in.
[01:20:41.382 --> 01:20:42.663]  I was like, wow.
[01:20:42.663 --> 01:20:44.844]  It's always a lot of fun.
[01:20:44.844 --> 01:20:47.186]  I've noticed that once a mistake starts, it's like a chain reaction.
[01:20:47.586 --> 01:20:50.167]  In a business, in a life, in a family, in a radio show.
[01:20:50.167 --> 01:20:56.829]  It's like, we won't have one for a week, and then when a show starts, it'll just, it'll just, it just brings in the spirit of that.
[01:20:56.829 --> 01:21:00.450]  And that's okay, because that's how you learn how things work.
[01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:02.951]  That's how you learn what's going on on the planet.
[01:21:02.951 --> 01:21:07.012]  That's how you see the flow of things.
[01:21:07.012 --> 01:21:15.255]  Because we're growing here, and we're adding a lot of new shows, and Owen Schroeder's gonna be hosting his own show, with Roger Stone and Mike Cernovich together.
[01:21:16.155 --> 01:21:20.439]  And that's going to be coming up in the month of August.
[01:21:20.439 --> 01:21:21.961]  That's going to be getting kicked off.
[01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:26.865]  And also, David Knight's going to be hosting his own morning transmission as well.
[01:21:26.865 --> 01:21:31.489]  But we're probably going to need to put all the liners for each show in their own show.
[01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:40.393]  Because the way this has been happening is we've got liners for the host when they come and they host for us here, when they fill in for me.
[01:21:40.393 --> 01:21:46.535]  I don't think there's going to be as much filling in in the future when they're all hosting three hours a day for themselves.
[01:21:46.535 --> 01:21:49.556]  Though David Knight has as much information to cover as I do.
[01:21:49.556 --> 01:21:53.697]  I think he's somebody that probably could do six hours a day.
[01:21:53.697 --> 01:21:58.419]  Okay, let me restart that segment for you and come in with the big news here.
[01:21:59.471 --> 01:22:10.810]  I was looking at the calls and what the callers wanted to talk about, and I saw a comment here from David in San Francisco, who we're going to go to first.
[01:22:16.024 --> 01:22:30.609]  wants to get into the fact that Al Gore came out on the Late Late Show Tuesday, and he said there's gonna be a big event basically challenging Trump in the next few months, removing him, and that we bipartisanly all need to come together.
[01:22:30.609 --> 01:22:42.774]  And then, of course, we have Brennan, a day before that, the former head of the CIA, on television with Wolf Blitzer and with Clapper, the head of National Intelligence formerly, both removed by Trump.
[01:22:43.254 --> 01:22:51.387]  There's the horrible traitorous activities they've been involved in with Wahhabists, radical Islam, illegal spying, lying to Congress, all the things that these...
[01:22:52.412 --> 01:22:53.752]  Anti-American crooks.
[01:22:53.752 --> 01:22:54.773]  That's not my view.
[01:22:54.773 --> 01:22:55.453]  They are crooks.
[01:22:55.453 --> 01:22:56.553]  Well-known crooks.
[01:22:56.553 --> 01:23:00.254]  All of these slimebag globalists, you know, are known for.
[01:23:00.254 --> 01:23:04.255]  They came out and they said, yes, something big is going to happen.
[01:23:04.255 --> 01:23:06.155]  Not impeachment, but something big.
[01:23:06.155 --> 01:23:08.516]  Removing the president suddenly.
[01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:17.778]  Now, what had the Pastor Brown, who'd been at the White House meeting with Trump and the meeting with senior members of Congress last week, what had he just said days before?
[01:23:17.778 --> 01:23:20.119]  That there is a preparation on Capitol Hill
[01:23:20.839 --> 01:23:29.447]  For an attempt to remove the President from office outside of law, outside of the Constitution, outside of impeachment or coup d'etat.
[01:23:29.447 --> 01:23:37.774]  And the good news is now Limbaugh's covering it, Sean Hannity's covering it, everybody's covering it who still isn't a traitor to this country.
[01:23:37.774 --> 01:23:41.898]  So that is a big victory for us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:42.478 --> 01:23:47.821]  That is a big victory that we forced this out so they just can't plan it in secret.
[01:23:47.821 --> 01:23:55.386]  No, by us exposing it, now they're having to publicly admit they're doing it to look confident for their own people who they're trying to prepare to do it.
[01:23:55.386 --> 01:23:56.047]  Now that said,
[01:23:57.199 --> 01:24:04.925]  Before I even saw that caller there, I was thinking earlier today, I need to come back and cover this today, because covering it just on Tuesday and Wednesday wasn't enough.
[01:24:04.925 --> 01:24:06.025]  This is a big deal.
[01:24:06.025 --> 01:24:07.366]  This is front and center.
[01:24:07.366 --> 01:24:13.251]  Yes, North Korea is threatening to nuke the United States and can now do it, and Bill Clinton and Hillary helped that happen.
[01:24:13.251 --> 01:24:16.153]  Yes, Obamacare repeal failed.
[01:24:16.153 --> 01:24:19.675]  That's the Democrat and Republican leadership's fault, not Trump's.
[01:24:19.675 --> 01:24:20.896]  Look at the media trying to spin it.
[01:24:20.896 --> 01:24:21.877]  That's important.
[01:24:21.877 --> 01:24:25.800]  But still, all of this isn't as clear and immediate
[01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:39.541]  As the Democrats and Republican leadership running around saying, let's remove Trump, let's remove Trump, let's remove Trump outside of a congressional move because they don't have the votes to do it.
[01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:44.225]  He has the legislative, he has the executive, he has the judicial.
[01:24:44.225 --> 01:24:50.270]  He has the legislative, he has the executive, he has the judicial, he has the American people.
[01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:53.493]  And the American people aren't buying the fake polls that he's got a 46% approval rating.
[01:24:55.313 --> 01:24:57.334]  Okay, so what are they going to do?
[01:24:57.334 --> 01:24:59.076]  Well, they've got to then just try to kill him.
[01:24:59.076 --> 01:25:03.659]  Because they're not going to let him, you know, just arrest him on some fake charges or something and then let him speak out.
[01:25:03.659 --> 01:25:07.701]  Okay, they're just going to tell you what a big failure he is all day though.
[01:25:07.701 --> 01:25:11.284]  Number one TV show ever with the ratings and profits.
[01:25:11.284 --> 01:25:16.467]  All these big successful golf courses and hotels and, you know, all the rest of it.
[01:25:16.467 --> 01:25:20.510]  And then running from nowhere against all the odds and winning the presidency.
[01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:22.071]  He hasn't accomplished anything.
[01:25:22.651 --> 01:25:27.974]  This is from National Review and CNN and the new globalist Fox News.
[01:25:27.974 --> 01:25:28.434]  No, no.
[01:25:28.434 --> 01:25:29.295]  He's a failure.
[01:25:29.295 --> 01:25:30.075]  You're a failure.
[01:25:30.075 --> 01:25:31.196]  You didn't elect Trump.
[01:25:31.196 --> 01:25:32.117]  The Russians did.
[01:25:32.117 --> 01:25:35.178]  Go home, climb in a ditch and die.
[01:25:35.178 --> 01:25:35.779]  That's the message.
[01:25:36.656 --> 01:25:41.638]  From them, they're just saying, suck air scumbags, go to hell, roll over, die.
[01:25:41.638 --> 01:25:45.780]  I hate my dumb effing users, says Zuckerberg.
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:48.522]  I hate you, I hate you, I'm going to take everything you've got.
[01:25:48.522 --> 01:25:50.863]  That's what he says in private conversations that have been leaked.
[01:25:50.863 --> 01:25:52.664]  Keep them desperate, keep them alone.
[01:25:52.664 --> 01:25:53.504]  What's in the WikiLeaks?
[01:25:53.504 --> 01:25:55.305]  Keep them desperate, keep them alone.
[01:25:55.305 --> 01:25:57.986]  Overrun them, make them pathetic, rot them under the ground.
[01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:00.427]  And you just loving trendies love it.
[01:26:00.427 --> 01:26:03.309]  All the little fake bots administering to them, and their little fake
[01:26:03.689 --> 01:26:04.530]  We're good to go.
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:27.121]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in San Francisco.
[01:26:27.121 --> 01:26:29.362]  David, I'm glad you care.
[01:26:29.362 --> 01:26:33.243]  They're out there now selling a coup d'etat against the president on TV.
[01:26:33.243 --> 01:26:35.404]  I think that's pretty sensational, don't you?
[01:26:35.404 --> 01:26:39.125]  And even if you hate Trump, what are they going to replace it with once you have a coup?
[01:26:39.125 --> 01:26:41.006]  You know, those things don't go away, do they?
[01:26:41.006 --> 01:26:43.147]  That'll be okay because the Democrats are being taught.
[01:26:43.527 --> 01:26:45.670]  It's time to outlaw libertarianism.
[01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:47.473]  It's time to outlaw nationalism.
[01:26:47.473 --> 01:26:49.917]  It's time to outlaw American flags.
[01:26:49.917 --> 01:26:53.101]  The Ninth Circuit banned those four years ago in schools.
[01:26:53.101 --> 01:26:55.485]  So we're going to ban the American flag on shirts?
[01:26:55.485 --> 01:26:56.547]  I mean, absolutely.
[01:26:56.547 --> 01:26:59.331]  It's time to have a one-party dictatorship, isn't it?
[01:27:00.546 --> 01:27:01.847]  You bet I care.
[01:27:01.847 --> 01:27:03.668]  Yeah, I mean, this is incredible.
[01:27:03.668 --> 01:27:06.891]  I am so glad that you're going to hammer away at this.
[01:27:06.891 --> 01:27:13.335]  And first of all, let me say hi to Daniel and Luke, my sons who are listening live.
[01:27:13.335 --> 01:27:16.417]  You know, let me see if I get this straight.
[01:27:16.417 --> 01:27:24.663]  Former, former Vice President of the United States of America, big fat mouth Al Gore.
[01:27:24.663 --> 01:27:28.546]  OK, and big fat mouth CIA guy Clapper.
[01:27:29.506 --> 01:27:52.592]  Actually said that Trump needs to beware of, quote, of the big event when we all know from Governor Jesse Ventura's studies, Jim Mars with two Rs, your studies on the assassination of the President, that it was clearly the code words that the CIA used to take down President Kennedy.
[01:27:52.592 --> 01:27:53.552]  Was the big event.
[01:27:53.552 --> 01:27:57.173]  And we're not going to arrest Big Fat Mouth Al Gore and Clapper.
[01:27:57.173 --> 01:27:58.573]  Arrest them now!
[01:27:59.289 --> 01:28:00.390]  No!
[01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:01.811]  What's going on here Alex?
[01:28:01.811 --> 01:28:03.532]  Listen, listen, listen.
[01:28:03.532 --> 01:28:11.938]  They're the ones calling for violence and so just like North Korea pointing missiles at us and saying we'll nuke you any minute and test firing them, then we're allowed to strike them.
[01:28:11.938 --> 01:28:15.361]  I mean I wouldn't be surprised if Trump doesn't move against these people.
[01:28:16.161 --> 01:28:19.826]  And you know, maybe Trump isn't going to have a big spectacle in the news about it either.
[01:28:19.826 --> 01:28:23.710]  And of course the media will spin that Jones is calling for violence against Gore and Clapper.
[01:28:23.710 --> 01:28:24.291]  No!
[01:28:24.291 --> 01:28:29.778]  And Brennan, Brennan, they're running around saying overthrow, you know, get ready for the president to be killed, whatever.
[01:28:29.778 --> 01:28:32.982]  All I'm saying is, they're in a man's world now.
[01:28:34.127 --> 01:28:39.132]  And I understand they're in the small pee-pee club there with Al Gore, you know, in the little pervert club and, you know, all the rest of it.
[01:28:39.132 --> 01:28:41.434]  But I mean, you know, this is the real world here.
[01:28:41.434 --> 01:28:42.815]  They've had a sleeping America.
[01:28:42.815 --> 01:28:44.156]  They've been strangling forever.
[01:28:44.156 --> 01:28:44.716]  Stay there, David.
[01:28:44.716 --> 01:28:47.039]  I want to come back and let you have a response back to that.
[01:28:47.039 --> 01:28:48.620]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:52.283]  I'm glad you teed this up because I should have started the broadcast.
[01:28:52.283 --> 01:28:56.007]  But I kind of got diverted with North Korea and Obamacare and all the rest of it.
[01:28:56.007 --> 01:28:58.469]  But we got to keep our eye on what's really happening.
[01:28:58.789 --> 01:28:59.590]  These desperate criminals.
[01:29:14.201 --> 01:29:21.244]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[01:29:21.244 --> 01:29:31.969]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[01:29:31.969 --> 01:29:35.631]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[01:29:37.512 --> 01:29:44.679]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:47.341]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:50.184]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth.
[01:29:50.184 --> 01:29:56.790]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:59.293]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[01:30:01.331 --> 01:30:06.052]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[01:30:06.052 --> 01:30:10.494]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.

[01:31:09.874 --> 01:31:17.957]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:18.257 --> 01:31:23.140]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:31:37.107 --> 01:31:43.970]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:48.613]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:31:58.300 --> 01:31:59.981]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:32:00.822 --> 01:32:11.406]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:11.406 --> 01:32:13.466]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:13.466 --> 01:32:16.347]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:16.347 --> 01:32:17.828]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:17.828 --> 01:32:20.969]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:32:21.069 --> 01:32:24.652]  It's absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:24.652 --> 01:32:26.733]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:32:26.733 --> 01:32:36.441]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:36.441 --> 01:32:48.771]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[01:32:48.951 --> 01:32:53.254]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:53.254 --> 01:32:56.537]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:58.138]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[01:32:58.138 --> 01:32:58.959]  With a Z-Shield.
[01:32:58.959 --> 01:33:03.502]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:03.502 --> 01:33:06.084]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:11.274 --> 01:33:12.575]  You've got it.
[01:33:12.575 --> 01:33:18.417]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:33:18.417 --> 01:33:22.779]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:22.779 --> 01:33:31.543]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:31.543 --> 01:33:35.045]  I say this all the time, but I need to take more calls.
[01:33:35.045 --> 01:33:38.666]  I need to get to them, because they always keep me honest.
[01:33:38.666 --> 01:33:39.167]  And by that,
[01:33:40.593 --> 01:33:53.721]  I should have started the broadcast again with the incredible news that they're just all over TV, all over radio, all over print, saying COG, overthrow Trump, kill him, violent end, sudden end.
[01:33:53.721 --> 01:33:55.102]  They're shopping it on Congress.
[01:33:55.102 --> 01:33:56.683]  They're shopping it at the Pentagon.
[01:33:56.683 --> 01:34:02.307]  And I don't see how they're going to kill him, because you know they're not going to let him live.
[01:34:02.307 --> 01:34:04.188]  And then sell that to everybody.
[01:34:05.612 --> 01:34:11.694]  Or are they gonna have, like, some fake loan nut that's supposedly his supporter, quote, mad at him over Obamacare or something?
[01:34:11.694 --> 01:34:14.034]  I mean, they'll script it where it's his fault.
[01:34:14.034 --> 01:34:15.875]  But no one's gonna buy it!
[01:34:15.875 --> 01:34:16.815]  I mean, this is not 1963!
[01:34:16.815 --> 01:34:25.638]  And quite frankly, Trump's a lot better than JFK.
[01:34:25.638 --> 01:34:32.259]  I mean, JFK did cut taxes for the general tax bracket 50%.
[01:34:32.259 --> 01:34:34.020]  Tax receipts doubled, by the way, within a year.
[01:34:34.704 --> 01:34:35.788]  Trump's trying the same stuff.
[01:34:37.113 --> 01:34:44.078]  Yeah, you cut taxes massively, it makes the economy explode, usually works for three years, and you can get out of a recession or depression that way.
[01:34:44.078 --> 01:34:55.805]  But I understand, I understand, mainstream media makes fun of Trump, and the Hollywood shows, and the Late Show, and the Late Late Show has Gore on saying he's going to be removed from office in a coup, so everybody just wants to be on the winning team.
[01:34:55.805 --> 01:35:00.128]  You don't actually want to be on the winning team, you want to simulate and imagine you're on the winning team.
[01:35:00.128 --> 01:35:01.309]  And I'm not talking to my audience.
[01:35:01.309 --> 01:35:06.673]  Remember audience, I'm always talking to the 20-30% that doesn't know their ass from a hole in the ground.
[01:35:07.454 --> 01:35:13.523]  I'm sorry to talk like that because I really care about these people but I'm not gonna sit there and kiss their butt trying to get them out of their coma.
[01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:18.398]  Okay, what Trump is doing is not fifth-dimensional chess like everybody says.
[01:35:18.398 --> 01:35:23.960]  It's simply classic Americana, classic default free market prosperity.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.140]  We know it works.
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:26.161]  We know it works.
[01:35:26.161 --> 01:35:27.701]  We know North Korea doesn't work.
[01:35:27.701 --> 01:35:29.802]  We know Venezuela's socialism doesn't work.
[01:35:29.802 --> 01:35:31.502]  We know this works.
[01:35:31.502 --> 01:35:39.665]  The problem is it creates multi-generational spoiled slobs who don't appreciate it and walk around wearing communist shirts while they wear $100 sneakers, drive $20,000 cars, and $1,000
[01:35:43.166 --> 01:35:48.129]  Yeah, the President needs to put Roger Stone in a very high position in the government.
[01:35:48.129 --> 01:35:54.592]  I'm not sure what position, but have you read the Jeb and the Bush crime family yet?
[01:36:13.951 --> 01:36:16.779]  Have I read what?
[01:36:16.779 --> 01:36:21.734]  A jab in the Bush crime family because the Bush is actually voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:36:22.133 --> 01:36:26.295]  Yes, yes, our Red Stones book that came out a few years ago, we sell it.
[01:36:26.295 --> 01:36:28.237]  It's the Bush crime family.
[01:36:28.237 --> 01:36:29.918]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:36:29.918 --> 01:36:31.398]  It just exposes the whole thing.
[01:36:31.398 --> 01:36:45.747]  What do you make about them publicly everywhere calling for his violent death, calling for his murder, calling for his overthrow, calling for an overthrow of the election, calling for going after the free press, showing up the American people.
[01:36:45.747 --> 01:36:48.809]  Don't the globalists get that that dog isn't going to hunt?
[01:36:48.809 --> 01:36:50.630]  That they're never going to get away with all this?
[01:36:51.838 --> 01:36:53.878]  This is anarchy, Alex.
[01:36:53.878 --> 01:37:00.660]  You know, President Trump is the president for the hour, like Abraham Lincoln was and George Washington was.
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:08.501]  And it's amazing, he's the 45th president, he's the 9th president that was elected on the Sabbath here, and the sum of 1 through 9 is 45.
[01:37:08.501 --> 01:37:12.922]  I mean, and the 70 weeks is the only prophecy that tells us when Christ would come.
[01:37:12.922 --> 01:37:14.683]  He's the president for the hour.
[01:37:14.683 --> 01:37:17.823]  And we need to start praying these Davidic prayers against Clapper and Al Gore.
[01:37:17.823 --> 01:37:20.764]  I hate to say it, but I don't hate to say it because it's in the Bible, okay?
[01:37:21.564 --> 01:37:22.184]  Absolutely.
[01:37:22.184 --> 01:37:24.045]  Prayer is real.
[01:37:24.045 --> 01:37:33.027]  It's been documented and humans focusing on something together literally manifested with the technology we have now and the culture and communication.
[01:37:33.027 --> 01:37:34.708]  The globalists know this.
[01:37:34.708 --> 01:37:38.309]  That's why they've got all these satanic people and witches praying against Trump.
[01:37:38.309 --> 01:37:42.810]  We need to get everybody active in the field, active on the ground, spreading the word.
[01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:57.834]  Working hard, building up the economy, being good people, being examples, but also praying for Trump, praying for Infowars, praying for everybody that's on the front lines fighting these people because they absolutely hate the fact that the Christians in America understand the score.
[01:37:57.834 --> 01:38:00.695]  And that's why I had that great Pastor Brown on Tuesday.
[01:38:00.695 --> 01:38:05.016]  I mean, he was word for word saying the same stuff I'm saying because we're on the same page.
[01:38:05.016 --> 01:38:10.678]  It's a spirit of resistance against this tyranny and understanding that this is the real deal.
[01:38:10.678 --> 01:38:11.238]  God bless you.
[01:38:11.238 --> 01:38:11.978]  I appreciate your call.
[01:38:13.655 --> 01:38:15.978]  Okay, let's go to more of these calls right now.
[01:38:15.978 --> 01:38:18.381]  Who is up next here?
[01:38:18.381 --> 01:38:20.904]  Let's go ahead and go to J.K.
[01:38:20.904 --> 01:38:21.445]  in D.C.
[01:38:21.445 --> 01:38:23.227]  then Frank, Jim, Alex, Sean.
[01:38:23.227 --> 01:38:24.549]  J.K., thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:38:25.686 --> 01:38:26.947]  Yes, hello Alex.
[01:38:26.947 --> 01:38:34.812]  I called to talk about information literacy, critical thinking in the information age as it relates to the info war and the battle between good and evil.
[01:38:34.812 --> 01:38:40.535]  And I'm a Master of Arts in teaching and I've given talks about information literacy in Istanbul, Bosnia, etc.
[01:38:40.535 --> 01:38:43.857]  And I've been invited to speak in many parts of the world.
[01:38:43.857 --> 01:38:46.579]  And you said something last month that really stood out.
[01:38:46.579 --> 01:38:48.380]  And so I stopped what I was doing, wrote it down.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:51.682]  You said info wars is a weapons system that is underused.
[01:38:52.922 --> 01:38:56.564]  And I totally agree, and I think I understand what you're referring to.
[01:38:56.564 --> 01:39:00.587]  Do I have 30 seconds to set the stage for it, to explain?
[01:39:00.587 --> 01:39:02.288]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:39:02.288 --> 01:39:11.093]  All right, so within the info war metaphor, you, Roger Stone, Pachanek, you guys are the generals, and the listeners are the info soldiers.
[01:39:11.093 --> 01:39:20.599]  And imagine having a fighting force that doesn't understand what the weapons are, understand, even know what the weapons are, or new weapons, they're not trained in it.
[01:39:21.306 --> 01:39:22.407]  I think that's what's going on.
[01:39:22.407 --> 01:39:24.128]  I think that's what you're referring to.
[01:39:24.128 --> 01:39:27.030]  And do you think the evil side knows what the weapons are?
[01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:35.156]  Do you think the criminal elements in the government, the deep state, they know exactly what the weapons are, and it's time that the good side know what they are.
[01:39:35.156 --> 01:39:40.200]  And that's what I think you're referring to, is InfoWars is a weapon system that is underused.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.341]  And information literacy understands that.
[01:39:42.341 --> 01:39:49.046]  And I teach students about information literacy, and I get invited to talk around the world about that.
[01:39:49.975 --> 01:40:04.170]  So, for example, when you get riled up from something that the evil side does or says, sometimes it's healthy, it's cathartic, you get it out, but other times you're about to blow a gasket and it's almost like that's a hit.
[01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:08.114]  When you react in a way that's unhealthy, it maybe shortens your life.
[01:40:08.114 --> 01:40:08.734]  Not good for you.
[01:40:08.734 --> 01:40:09.255]  Don't like that.
[01:40:09.255 --> 01:40:09.936]  Sure, sure.
[01:40:09.936 --> 01:40:10.977]  I mean, I'm frustrated.
[01:40:12.719 --> 01:40:16.003]  Let it out sometimes, but listen, here's the problem.
[01:40:16.003 --> 01:40:18.286]  People are on the ground seeing what they're seeing.
[01:40:18.286 --> 01:40:21.911]  If they videotape Hillary falling down, that probably won the election for Trump.
[01:40:21.911 --> 01:40:28.921]  It's little things like that, all of us being awake, all of us putting data out, all of us sharing our own independent information,
[01:40:31.991 --> 01:40:32.271]  Thank you.
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:41:03.085]  And figure out what they're going to do to resist, whether it be big or small, all of it together creates a massive wave that cannot be stopped.
[01:41:03.085 --> 01:41:05.966]  So yes, our info war is underutilized.
[01:41:05.966 --> 01:41:18.314]  The listeners need to know how critical it is, and we're not just spectators here, and what a critical juncture we're at here in civilization, and that we've never had more information, but we've never had more disinformation being flooded as well.
[01:41:19.274 --> 01:41:22.057]  And so, again, it's a big, big subject.
[01:41:22.057 --> 01:41:25.819]  They ask me all the time, how do I know what a real news source is versus another one?
[01:41:25.819 --> 01:41:31.584]  And it's way beyond complex from that perspective even.
[01:41:31.584 --> 01:41:33.385]  So it's almost like you can't even teach this stuff.
[01:41:33.385 --> 01:41:35.667]  You've just got to experience it and learn it.
[01:41:35.667 --> 01:41:37.749]  And then I only have my experiences and my knowledge.
[01:41:37.749 --> 01:41:40.571]  Other people have their own knowledge that has a whole different perspective.
[01:41:40.951 --> 01:41:50.300]  All it is, is don't believe MSM, start getting involved, start thinking about ways to make the world a better place, and start identifying the globalists as true enemies of humanity, because they are.
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:54.304]  Realize they're bad people, and all they think of is scams.
[01:41:54.304 --> 01:41:55.305]  How do we defeat them?
[01:41:55.305 --> 01:41:57.627]  Because just removing them will make the world a better place.
[01:41:57.627 --> 01:41:57.848]  Go ahead.
[01:41:59.215 --> 01:42:09.598]  I agree with that, but I'm saying there are very specific weapons for the good side, that if the soldiers became aware of them, it'd be more effective.
[01:42:09.598 --> 01:42:12.499]  Imagine having a new weapon and no one gets training on it.
[01:42:12.499 --> 01:42:17.920]  There are very... because you said Infant Wars is a weapon system, and it is, and so is the evil side.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.562]  They're a weapon system, and they're using it effectively, and what you just said is true.
[01:42:22.562 --> 01:42:25.602]  All those things are working, but you could be more conscious of it.
[01:42:25.602 --> 01:42:27.203]  There are very specific weapons
[01:42:27.723 --> 01:42:29.004]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:42:29.004 --> 01:42:31.547]  Send your name and info to showtipsandinfowars.com.
[01:42:31.547 --> 01:42:34.089]  Recommend yourself or other guests I can get on.
[01:42:44.079 --> 01:42:44.680]  About that.
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:47.685]  Because I think just in general, seeking knowledge is the key.
[01:42:47.685 --> 01:42:49.388]  Not getting into infighting.
[01:42:49.388 --> 01:42:51.831]  And exposing the whole globalist paradigm and its systems.
[01:42:51.831 --> 01:42:56.018]  Once you know that, then you see how their globalist operations are being carried out.
[01:42:56.018 --> 01:42:57.681]  Then you research it and find out you're dead on.
[01:43:00.271 --> 01:43:05.912]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[01:43:05.912 --> 01:43:14.574]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[01:43:14.574 --> 01:43:22.456]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[01:43:22.456 --> 01:43:28.597]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[01:43:28.957 --> 01:43:31.999]  NAR, lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[01:43:31.999 --> 01:43:36.702]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[01:43:36.702 --> 01:43:40.484]  And just one batch of this stuff cost us more than $30,000.
[01:43:40.484 --> 01:43:43.206]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.

[01:44:30.157 --> 01:44:38.902]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.

[01:45:49.083 --> 01:45:54.448]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what I did for them, because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:57.530]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or AAA2533139.

[01:47:03.881 --> 01:47:06.483]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:16.612 --> 01:47:21.947]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:47:21.947 --> 01:47:24.234]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:47:29.463 --> 01:47:39.431]  The point is there's a giant technocracy building a new world where the general public doesn't exist, with a maximum population of 150 million.
[01:47:39.431 --> 01:47:41.832]  That's official UN numbers.
[01:47:41.832 --> 01:47:51.140]  That's officially an eco-science written by the outgoing science czar John P. Holdren back on the year I was born, 1974, and adopted into UN global policy under UNESCO.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:52.921]  These aren't my opinions.
[01:47:52.921 --> 01:47:55.282]  That's how I told you they were going to push microchipping.
[01:47:55.282 --> 01:47:59.325]  It's how I told you that your smart appliances would be watching you 20 years ago.
[01:47:59.325 --> 01:48:01.186]  Because it's in all the literature.
[01:48:01.186 --> 01:48:03.167]  It's in the plans.
[01:48:03.167 --> 01:48:06.049]  And the technology is 30, 40 years in advance.
[01:48:06.049 --> 01:48:08.270]  My dad was going to UT in high school in 1966.
[01:48:11.002 --> 01:48:13.203]  And it's called Plan 2.
[01:48:13.203 --> 01:48:14.184]  He was there in the summers.
[01:48:14.184 --> 01:48:16.665]  And they had CD-ROM and computers.
[01:48:16.665 --> 01:48:19.086]  And they said, oh, we're going to show you the nuclear reactor.
[01:48:19.086 --> 01:48:20.967]  We show all the engineering students.
[01:48:20.967 --> 01:48:22.167]  No one else gets to see it.
[01:48:22.167 --> 01:48:22.768]  Tell anybody.
[01:48:22.768 --> 01:48:27.030]  That's how you're automatically inducted into the secret societies, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:28.431]  And you don't even know it's happened.
[01:48:28.431 --> 01:48:29.151]  You're just in it.
[01:48:30.302 --> 01:48:32.986]  And then I'm here trying to tell people stuff that's public!
[01:48:32.986 --> 01:48:36.351]  Now I've got four or five callers I promise I'm going to get to.
[01:48:36.351 --> 01:48:37.873]  Jim, Frank, Alex, and Sean.
[01:48:37.873 --> 01:48:38.453]  Bam, bam, bam.
[01:48:38.453 --> 01:48:42.139]  But briefly, you ask how you can support what you can do?
[01:48:42.139 --> 01:48:42.840]  Spread the article.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.021]  Spread the videos.
[01:48:44.021 --> 01:48:45.463]  Know they're trying to censor and block.
[01:48:45.463 --> 01:48:46.144]  You keep doing it.
[01:48:46.144 --> 01:48:46.965]  That's why we're beating them.
[01:48:48.354 --> 01:48:49.455]  We're just one focal point.
[01:48:49.455 --> 01:48:51.317]  We also sell products to support ourselves.
[01:48:51.317 --> 01:49:04.669]  Seventy plus percent of our funding is from you buying products at infowarestore.com, beingprisonplanted.tv members so other people can enjoy stuff for free, but you get it in HD and all the films in HD in a source they can't censor as easily.
[01:49:05.543 --> 01:49:06.084]  We're good to go.
[01:49:21.244 --> 01:49:25.867]  Caveman Bone Broth Ultimate Formula in Strawberry and Chocolate, 25% off.
[01:49:25.867 --> 01:49:41.995]  The Super Silver Special Colloidal Silver, Colloidal Silver Toothpaste, Fluoride Free and an Electric Toothbrush that's proprietary, super high quality, that has silver impregnated in the brushes to keep it absolute, so you're not just reinfecting yourself every time you brush your teeth.
[01:49:41.995 --> 01:49:43.816]  Yeah, hot water doesn't do it, folks.
[01:49:43.816 --> 01:49:44.837]  The silver does.
[01:49:44.837 --> 01:49:45.277]  That's 50% off.
[01:49:45.277 --> 01:49:48.599]  I mean, the electric toothbrush is a lost leader at that price.
[01:49:49.167 --> 01:49:51.169]  Okay, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:49:51.169 --> 01:49:53.931]  DNA Force will sell out in the next four days.
[01:49:53.931 --> 01:49:56.233]  It's still 20% off, despite that.
[01:49:56.233 --> 01:49:58.836]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:49:58.836 --> 01:50:06.803]  We've got Mullen Law Bay shirts, CNN's fake news shirts, InfoWars' real news shirts.
[01:50:06.803 --> 01:50:08.584]  It's about meeting like-minded people.
[01:50:08.584 --> 01:50:09.605]  It's about spreading the word.
[01:50:09.605 --> 01:50:11.007]  It's about not being bullied.
[01:50:11.007 --> 01:50:13.369]  It's about taking action and valuing yourself.
[01:50:13.869 --> 01:50:16.131]  Okay, let's take four final calls.
[01:50:16.131 --> 01:50:17.673]  Jim in Texas.
[01:50:17.673 --> 01:50:19.634]  He wants to talk about the midterm elections.
[01:50:19.634 --> 01:50:22.557]  These are the most important election ever.
[01:50:22.557 --> 01:50:23.438]  2016 was key.
[01:50:23.438 --> 01:50:25.780]  Now everyone is sudden death.
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:27.221]  Okay, to keep this thing peaceful.
[01:50:27.221 --> 01:50:30.184]  They want to make it violent because we're winning.
[01:50:30.184 --> 01:50:31.985]  2016 was key, but 2018 is king.
[01:50:31.985 --> 01:50:34.968]  Go ahead.
[01:50:34.968 --> 01:50:39.132]  Yeah, this is funny how the Lord had this happen following up on the previous call because
[01:50:39.853 --> 01:50:50.900]  I also want to talk about the gift God has given you at InfoWars as an underutilized tool and two suggestions on how you might utilize it better.
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:55.603]  One on the candidate front and one on the vote fraud front.
[01:50:55.603 --> 01:50:57.644]  On the candidate front, you've already
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:50:58.780]  We're good to go.
[01:51:20.313 --> 01:51:34.765]  Maybe asking for viewers around the country to identify candidates that are going on the primary ballot in their community, and maybe you could do a regular segment on Tuesday, Thursday, or Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and then maybe closer as the time rolls around, even do it every day of the week.
[01:51:34.765 --> 01:51:35.165]  Your thoughts?
[01:51:35.385 --> 01:51:45.595]  Absolutely and you know we're trying to focus in and give candidates that have a shot in major elections a platform but InfoWars and our audience can't carry it all alone.
[01:51:45.595 --> 01:51:55.485]  Everybody needs to identify those people themselves locally or run themselves to use whether you run for dog catcher or city commission or city council or state house or congress
[01:51:55.965 --> 01:52:06.650]  You want to get involved in those debates on TV to bring up real issues and to have chain reactions to point out that the polls are fake, to point out there's a global awakening, and to use that bully pulpit.
[01:52:06.650 --> 01:52:07.330]  Thank you so much.
[01:52:07.330 --> 01:52:08.110]  Great points.
[01:52:08.110 --> 01:52:15.214]  Just getting back to Congressman Steve King of Iowa saying criminally investigate Clinton, Obama, all of them.
[01:52:15.214 --> 01:52:16.894]  That is so big to have more of that.
[01:52:16.894 --> 01:52:17.575]  Say no.
[01:52:17.575 --> 01:52:19.195]  You're the ones that committed the crimes.
[01:52:19.195 --> 01:52:20.396]  Here it all is proven.
[01:52:21.796 --> 01:52:22.897]  You wanted somebody to go to jail?
[01:52:22.897 --> 01:52:23.857]  You're about to go to jail.
[01:52:23.857 --> 01:52:29.680]  That's a big part of the solution, is recognizing key information like that and getting it out to everybody.
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:31.260]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:32.421]  That was Jim.
[01:52:32.421 --> 01:52:36.663]  Let's go to Frank in North Carolina.
[01:52:36.663 --> 01:52:37.103]  You're on the air.
[01:52:38.979 --> 01:52:40.941]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:52:40.941 --> 01:52:45.924]  One quick correction, I never said that Infowars never covered the attack on the USS Liberty.
[01:52:45.924 --> 01:52:47.726]  You misrepresented what I said.
[01:52:47.726 --> 01:52:49.987]  Oh God, listen, I don't screen your call, man.
[01:52:49.987 --> 01:52:55.552]  I'm saying when I made a film about the USS Liberty, all the people that attacked me say it was to cover up that Israel attacked it.
[01:52:55.552 --> 01:52:57.733]  When the film says Israel attacked it, knew it.
[01:52:57.733 --> 01:52:58.874]  It's mental illness.
[01:52:58.874 --> 01:53:01.056]  Now go ahead if you've got a point.
[01:53:01.056 --> 01:53:03.418]  Yeah, well I'm calling in to talk about H.R.
[01:53:03.418 --> 01:53:04.779]  1697 and Senate Bill 720.
[01:53:06.786 --> 01:53:16.337]  I don't know if you guys are covering that over there, but I think it's probably one of the biggest unconstitutional bills since the Patriot Act.
[01:53:16.337 --> 01:53:19.020]  You're talking about the asset forfeiture stuff?
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:19.100]  Yes.
[01:53:23.681 --> 01:53:27.862]  I mean, would we allow this if Ireland was trying to push this?
[01:53:27.862 --> 01:53:29.343]  No, no, I totally agree.
[01:53:29.343 --> 01:53:33.064]  Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump has gone back on the Vaccine Commission.
[01:53:33.064 --> 01:53:34.364]  He's at least not doing anything right now.
[01:53:34.364 --> 01:53:36.505]  He pointed to bad people.
[01:53:36.505 --> 01:53:39.326]  This asset forfeiture thing is
[01:53:40.586 --> 01:53:41.826]  Really gets rid of due process.
[01:53:41.826 --> 01:53:43.067]  It's very, very dangerous.
[01:53:43.067 --> 01:53:43.967]  It's already been abused.
[01:53:43.967 --> 01:53:44.907]  It's already out of control.
[01:53:44.907 --> 01:53:46.767]  I don't care they claim, oh, it's for drug dealers.
[01:53:46.767 --> 01:53:47.328]  Give me a break.
[01:53:47.328 --> 01:53:48.848]  We all know who controls the drugs.
[01:53:48.848 --> 01:53:51.849]  The argument for Brzezinski is that's how you control the criminals.
[01:53:51.849 --> 01:53:55.870]  No, that's how they create a whole separate government.
[01:53:55.870 --> 01:54:00.131]  And absolutely, I don't like that legislation and I don't like the fact that Trump's supporting it.
[01:54:00.131 --> 01:54:05.892]  Plus, where's the move to repeal the IRS or reform it or punish them for the persecution?
[01:54:05.892 --> 01:54:09.593]  A bunch of the IRS people that were in there
[01:54:10.663 --> 01:54:15.788]  Whenever Obama was in persecuting Christians and conservatives are still there.
[01:54:15.788 --> 01:54:18.730]  Now I understand there's a mutiny against Trump and they're blocking him.
[01:54:18.730 --> 01:54:19.791]  So I don't even blame him.
[01:54:19.791 --> 01:54:21.853]  It's up to us to make a big noise about it.
[01:54:21.853 --> 01:54:24.316]  Great points, Jim or Frank.
[01:54:24.316 --> 01:54:25.697]  I appreciate your call.
[01:54:25.697 --> 01:54:31.062]  Alex, Alex in San Diego, formerly a state of California, FEMA Region 9.
[01:54:31.062 --> 01:54:31.802]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:54:31.802 --> 01:54:32.103]  Go ahead.
[01:54:35.464 --> 01:54:37.025]  Okay, Alex is gone.
[01:54:37.025 --> 01:54:39.107]  Sean in New York.
[01:54:39.107 --> 01:54:40.028]  You're on the air, Sean.
[01:54:40.028 --> 01:54:42.370]  Thanks for holding.
[01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:42.911]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:50.355]  First off, I want to give you kudos and say I wear all your shirts walking around here in Midtown Manhattan.
[01:54:50.355 --> 01:54:56.320]  I cannot tell you how fun it is and really upsetting people around here.
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:58.862]  Well, you're our last caller, so you've got about three, four minutes.
[01:54:58.862 --> 01:55:02.185]  Just briefly, you're calling on a different subject.
[01:55:02.185 --> 01:55:03.706]  Tell me what it's like.
[01:55:03.706 --> 01:55:04.887]  What percentage is positive?
[01:55:04.887 --> 01:55:06.028]  What percentage is negative?
[01:55:06.028 --> 01:55:08.750]  Because it really is an adventure to wear an InfoWars shirt.
[01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:09.591]  It's a lot safer.
[01:55:09.591 --> 01:55:12.433]  A Trump shirt, you might get hit in the head with a ball-peen hammer, but go ahead.
[01:55:13.410 --> 01:55:28.024]  Yeah, well, I wear the Trump pants 2021, and let me tell you, ironically, I get high fives from a lot of younger people and a lot of minorities, Latin and African American.
[01:55:28.024 --> 01:55:33.950]  The people who get the most angry are ugly old women with dogs and cats.
[01:55:34.862 --> 01:55:40.944]  Um, those are usually the ones, those make those weird sounds, like, and like, they just, they just attack you.
[01:55:40.944 --> 01:55:50.967]  Shit spews, yes, shit spews, exactly, like bleeding out of the eyes, the old woman looks completely insane, I'm sorry, that's true, that, it's old, weird, crazy women are the vanguard of the globalists.
[01:55:50.967 --> 01:55:57.889]  And I agree, it's minorities that are some of Trump's biggest supporters, at my own rallies, but the media covers it up.
[01:55:57.889 --> 01:55:59.890]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:55:59.890 --> 01:56:03.091]  The point, the point I wanted to make, I hope I get to it quickly, is just,
[01:56:03.647 --> 01:56:09.111]  I understand that the Democrats are like, eh, Hillary, eh, whatever the hell you tell us.
[01:56:09.111 --> 01:56:14.035]  But I don't understand how within the Republican Party, where did Susan Collins come from?
[01:56:14.035 --> 01:56:15.677]  Where did Murkowski come from?
[01:56:15.677 --> 01:56:17.258]  Where did McCain come from?
[01:56:17.258 --> 01:56:18.899]  Who the hell are these people?
[01:56:18.899 --> 01:56:20.280]  Who the hell is voting for them?
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:25.485]  These are globalist operatives run and put in because they're Democrats.
[01:56:25.485 --> 01:56:28.687]  And I'm telling you, the Republican traitors are the leaders of the Democrats.
[01:56:28.687 --> 01:56:30.609]  They admit McCain is the head of the Democratic Party.
[01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:38.373]  They admit McCain is the head of the Democratic Party and that he's their quote chairman and he directs them with criminal elements of the deep state.
[01:56:38.373 --> 01:56:54.923]  So the brains are the Republican leadership that actually run the mentally ill Democrats and the mentally ill Democrats who literally don't know what planet they're on, like Pelosi, they now believe they're overthrowing the Republicans because they were given a green light because the Libertarians began to take over the Republicans.
[01:56:54.923 --> 01:56:58.705]  So we forced this civil war in the government and now we're winning.
[01:57:00.169 --> 01:57:02.370]  We just got to get ready to see, but I just can't take a look.
[01:57:02.370 --> 01:57:03.491]  I just look at his face.
[01:57:03.491 --> 01:57:09.334]  I'm just like, oh, I just, I just, I almost have one of those reactions that I, that I love that, that, that you have.
[01:57:09.334 --> 01:57:10.334]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[01:57:10.334 --> 01:57:13.576]  Um, what else did you call on about today here as we close out the transmission?
[01:57:14.768 --> 01:57:16.469]  Oh, you know, that's just it, man.
[01:57:16.469 --> 01:57:17.330]  That's about it.
[01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:21.152]  You know, I actually work for the Globalist Empire here in New York.
[01:57:21.152 --> 01:57:25.895]  I work at a big four firm doing international mergers and acquisitions.
[01:57:25.895 --> 01:57:29.758]  Look, I want to tell people, you are a number on a spreadsheet.
[01:57:29.758 --> 01:57:33.940]  I have done spreadsheets where we put all this stuff in, we press enter.
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:39.004]  If cell B14 turns green, we fire your asses and we move overseas.
[01:57:39.004 --> 01:57:40.865]  If it turns red, you don't.
[01:57:40.865 --> 01:57:42.146]  You are a number.
[01:57:42.146 --> 01:57:43.547]  You are right on, my friend.
[01:57:44.167 --> 01:57:46.719]  And Hillary talks about it in her WikiLeaks.
[01:57:46.719 --> 01:57:47.423]  See you tomorrow, folks.
[01:57:47.423 --> 01:57:47.985]  God bless you all.
