[00:49.640 --> 00:54.360]  be great to have more people like him in government and that's based on calling
[00:54.360 --> 00:58.320]  us we need somebody like him to run for governor for Wisconsin he comes across
[00:58.320 --> 01:03.720]  as being like just like such honorable he comes across as smart and smooth and
[01:03.720 --> 01:09.200]  a constitutionalist that's exactly what you need hey he's honest and you know
[01:09.200 --> 01:12.880]  the people have his back because the Constitution has ours you know if you
[01:12.880 --> 01:16.960]  can't get in as a governor he can always you know push maybe put together the
[01:16.960 --> 01:20.720]  old sheriff's policy again you know I have people are training with CCW's
[01:20.720 --> 01:24.880]  volunteer because why why I'm in Wisconsin it's all voluntarily fire
[01:24.880 --> 01:28.600]  departments are they are pretty volunteers their time and they're proud
[01:28.600 --> 01:32.400]  of it aren't volunteer firefighters great people I know so many of them and
[01:32.400 --> 01:35.720]  the type of neighbors you can just ask them to help you do anything they're
[01:35.720 --> 01:39.680]  all excited about it and love doing it and they just love going out and they
[01:39.680 --> 01:44.120]  get killed all the time working for free to try to help people out and then
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.440]  when we had a big fires out in Bastrop mainly because the feds wouldn't let
[01:49.440 --> 01:52.600]  everybody cut some deadwood and some forest and we had a drought and they
[01:52.600 --> 01:55.680]  were they would keep the volunteer fire departments most of them from being able
[01:55.680 --> 02:00.040]  to go out there and help people and FEMA said you're not real firefighters even
[02:00.040 --> 02:03.440]  though they drive the trucks and fight the fires and everything it's just
[02:03.440 --> 02:08.680]  unbelievable because they don't want real volunteerism they want fake federal
[02:08.680 --> 02:14.040]  volunteerism exactly they don't want people being responsible for themselves
[02:14.040 --> 02:17.800]  in their communities you know don't forget what the mainstream media says
[02:17.800 --> 02:21.240]  about you you know you've been right about everything I've been listening
[02:21.240 --> 02:25.600]  for three four years I actually got turned on to you by Glenn Beck mentioning
[02:25.600 --> 02:31.720]  you and I'm like who's Alex Jones guy was it a nice thing Glenn Beck said no
[02:31.720 --> 02:36.480]  it happened to be with FEMA stuff with FEMA camps I'll say those don't exist
[02:36.480 --> 02:39.920]  only on you because I started listening to you and then you got into that but
[02:39.920 --> 02:42.840]  you'd mentioned before and like I said more than mentioning the mainstream
[02:42.840 --> 02:46.600]  media and where people see that this is like a false reality that's being
[02:46.600 --> 02:50.800]  projected on them you know maybe well that's what's a bummer about Glenn I mean
[02:50.800 --> 02:54.040]  the fact that they're training for civil unrest it's in the Army times and that
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.960]  they've got the emergency centers act I mean it's it's I sent Glenn all that
[02:58.960 --> 03:03.040]  stuff is what made me mad my listeners did because he hyped for a month he was
[03:03.040 --> 03:08.440]  gonna we expose all that in police state for the rise of FEMA and he got up
[03:08.440 --> 03:14.000]  there and I and used fake FEMA camps to then discredit everything and I even
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.280]  predicted that I don't want to get into a Glenn Beck bashing fest but thank you
[03:19.280 --> 03:24.440]  so much Mike glad that glad you tuned in yeah we're not right about everything
[03:24.440 --> 03:27.800]  but we try to be right when we try to be accurate and that's a big difference I
[03:27.800 --> 03:32.600]  get names wrong I get things backwards sometimes we all do that you know
[03:32.600 --> 03:37.640]  sometimes I step off the front porch and fall flat on my face we were filming
[03:37.640 --> 03:41.600]  something or the other day and I just spilled I think it's on camera we were
[03:41.600 --> 03:46.160]  shooting a video in there and I got up to do something just fell right over dude
[03:46.160 --> 03:49.840]  was walking I tripped over his back leg I think that's on tapes me pretty funny
[03:49.840 --> 03:53.080]  because I went flying across the floor I mean we all make mistakes the
[03:53.080 --> 03:57.560]  difference is I'm not trying to lie to you okay you've got my word my
[03:57.560 --> 04:01.280]  commitment I'm trying to really tell you what I believe to be the truth but I
[04:01.280 --> 04:07.520]  roll fallible Robin mass last caller got about 45 seconds hello hey buddy go

[04:19.280 --> 04:24.880]  came down right here in Main Street and you know I had heard about some things
[04:24.880 --> 04:28.720]  about Bill Gates doing weather modification and things in that yeah
[04:28.720 --> 04:33.320]  no he funds billions in it yeah area that was devastated there's some pretty
[04:33.320 --> 04:37.560]  big corporate interest that's being pushed they want to put some casinos and
[04:37.560 --> 04:42.040]  things like that in there yeah I noticed they've been saying and they're not
[04:42.040 --> 04:46.240]  going to rebuild only big corporations can that's a telltale sign but you know
[04:46.240 --> 04:50.040]  there's naturally bad weather but Al Gore says you know bad weather's a reason to

[08:07.440 --> 08:17.440]  network
[08:22.440 --> 08:30.280]  ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the 18th of day of February 2013 I am your
[08:30.280 --> 08:34.440]  host Alex Jones and we are going to be here today as we are every weekday 12
[08:34.440 --> 08:41.760]  noon to 3 p.m. Eastern 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central I am your host Alex Jones and
[08:41.760 --> 08:48.720]  our country is being swallowed and colonized by private fraudulent Ponzi
[08:48.720 --> 08:57.400]  scheme manipulating systems that are carrying out massive fraud against the
[08:57.400 --> 09:05.840]  American people and the people of the world and they are establishing a
[09:05.840 --> 09:09.840]  classical police state with an overlay of high-tech control they're
[09:09.840 --> 09:14.440]  announcing drones to surveil everyone checkpoints on the highways billions of
[09:14.440 --> 09:19.840]  bullets warrantless wiretapping that they denied is now open secret arrest of
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.800]  citizens that torture is good that foreign military runs the Pentagon just
[09:25.800 --> 09:31.640]  unbelievable off the chart type stuff is being thrown in our face and at the
[09:31.640 --> 09:38.040]  same time the establishment collaborator globalist media is running
[09:38.040 --> 09:43.640]  around claiming that none of this is happening or if it is happening we're
[09:43.640 --> 09:48.000]  discredited for not liking it now remember while all of this was being
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.360]  shut up the establishment said none of it was actually happening now that it's
[09:51.360 --> 09:55.320]  all being rolled out against us they're saying it's happening but that it is a
[09:55.320 --> 10:01.080]  good thing now you'll remember last week a CNN panel said Dorner's alleged
[10:01.080 --> 10:08.960]  murder spree was exciting like a Denzel Washington movie and on a CNN show
[10:08.960 --> 10:14.880]  called reliable sources that routinely attacks yours truly with the main head of
[10:14.880 --> 10:21.960]  the program being Howard Kurtz the so-called reporter replace several
[10:21.960 --> 10:31.880]  clips today of these guys they say that I have legitimized Dorner as a killer
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.160]  now you know I have been critical of Dorner from day one and you know this is
[10:37.160 --> 10:40.800]  180 degrees of what I've actually said we're gonna play this clip coming up and
[10:40.800 --> 10:49.520]  then I'm gonna play CNN on one of their panel shows one of their pundits
[10:49.520 --> 10:56.240]  actually saying that Dorner's like a superhero exciting like a Denzel
[10:56.240 --> 11:02.360]  Washington movie those are quotes so they go out and say this and then blame
[11:02.360 --> 11:06.680]  yours truly and it's the same thing with a whole bunch of publications not just
[11:06.680 --> 11:12.840]  Atlantic wire saying that info wars calm and Alex Jones said that the United
[11:12.840 --> 11:18.680]  States attacked Russia with kinetic weapons when DA 14 came by and I believe
[11:18.680 --> 11:24.000]  some of the spurs of the stone meteorite came into the atmosphere we said the
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.560]  opposite and wrote articles and did video reports saying that it was a hoax
[11:30.560 --> 11:39.600]  and then it turns out that major publications came out and said that we
[11:39.600 --> 11:49.880]  said the opposite of what we said there was an AP article what Saturday that ran
[11:49.880 --> 11:55.400]  in newspapers all over the country and was picked up by Fox News CNN you name it
[11:55.400 --> 12:01.400]  all reported on it saying that I basically made up 1.6 billion bullets and
[12:01.400 --> 12:06.760]  they say well the conspiracy theorist says this it's true sort of but not
[12:06.760 --> 12:11.400]  really and then never say I'm wrong or never give the proof just list the 1.6
[12:11.400 --> 12:16.680]  plus billion bullets but just say it's no big deal oh man that guy got caught
[12:16.680 --> 12:21.920]  lying you know he said he saw a red Volkswagen parked in his driveway and
[12:21.920 --> 12:25.160]  there's the red Volkswagen didn't he discredited you're like well but the
[12:25.160 --> 12:30.480]  red Volkswagen is parked there I know if he discredited you know that Alex he
[12:30.480 --> 12:33.760]  said the sum would come up this morning and did you see it came up man he's
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.400]  really discredited I mean their propaganda has now reached cuckoo for
[12:38.400 --> 12:44.920]  cocoa puffs level I don't even I don't even get it it's so bad and that's why
[12:44.920 --> 12:49.560]  CNN on average has about a hundred and eight thousand viewers their top shows
[12:49.560 --> 12:52.920]  on average have about a half million like Pierce Morgan just because of the
[12:52.920 --> 12:57.280]  time slot it's in just about 12 13 14 years ago you can look it up Larry King
[12:57.280 --> 13:05.080]  had 10 million viewers on many nights 10 million 10 million viewers and now they
[13:05.080 --> 13:12.480]  have half a million and so just keep it up guys keep it up saying Alex Jones
[13:12.480 --> 13:17.520]  supports Dorner we're gonna play that clip Alex Jones says the US attack Russia
[13:17.520 --> 13:22.040]  with a meteorite or some kind of kinetic weapon never said that said the Russian
[13:22.040 --> 13:25.680]  government some of their members of their parliament were saying it other
[13:25.680 --> 13:28.880]  duma and I thought it was not true and I thought it was a piece of a stone
[13:28.880 --> 13:36.320]  meteorite and more pieces have come in over Florida, California, Cuba yes that's
[13:36.320 --> 13:41.440]  the same chunk they saw in southern Florida and bunch of other places and
[13:41.440 --> 13:45.840]  now California I always say California and I predicted you'd have spurs around
[13:45.840 --> 13:51.160]  it because that's standard for a big asteroid and I said I believe this is
[13:51.160 --> 13:56.440]  all natural and normal and I'm clear and no one in my staff wrote an article
[13:56.440 --> 14:00.240]  no one in the crew wrote an article saying it was a conspiracy theory we
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.120]  wrote articles picked up by drudgereport.com which then got picked up by
[14:05.120 --> 14:08.000]  the site Zeit this was one of the top stories in the country that day they
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.920]  follow trends and seeing in actually linked to it and then demonized it and
[14:12.920 --> 14:18.600]  said look Alex Jones that's another CNN I forgot I saw that clip last time I
[14:18.600 --> 14:22.720]  forgot to even send the guys I can't even keep track of this anymore I mean
[14:22.720 --> 14:31.480]  it's MSNBC CNBC CNN Fox News demonizing yours truly saying things about us that
[14:31.480 --> 14:34.960]  aren't true now I've got all this world news how the mega banks are engineering
[14:34.960 --> 14:39.720]  the collapse how we can get out of this how Obama care is meant to bankrupt
[14:39.720 --> 14:44.120]  people how the payroll taxes have gone up on the poor how Obama broke his
[14:44.120 --> 14:53.160]  promises how he wouldn't raise our payroll taxes on and on and on all of
[14:53.160 --> 15:01.480]  this is going on and it really freaks me out I'm gonna be honest with you that
[15:01.480 --> 15:05.400]  I'm just here who studied history studied the globalists read their own
[15:05.400 --> 15:09.080]  publications I know their plan it's public they operate like you don't
[15:09.080 --> 15:12.360]  exist and they put it all in publications but they're all thick
[15:12.360 --> 15:22.080]  lengthy foreign affairs and Club of Rome and Princeton and MIT and Davos
[15:22.080 --> 15:30.040]  papers EU papers British Ministry Defense papers Pentagon papers ran
[15:30.040 --> 15:34.120]  corporation papers and I read this stuff and it's just all public how they put
[15:34.120 --> 15:37.640]  poison in the water how they put it in the food how they want to feminize men
[15:37.640 --> 15:41.400]  how they're giving us cancer how they're gonna break up the family how they're
[15:41.400 --> 15:48.600]  gonna have three mega regions and I just can't take it anymore I mean it's it
[15:48.600 --> 15:53.400]  really gets to me folks and I get really stressed out because I have all these
[15:53.400 --> 15:56.760]  brainstorms and I want to get up here on air and warn you and then I get up
[15:56.760 --> 15:59.840]  here and I spend most of my time I'm not complaining it's just it's just that
[15:59.840 --> 16:03.360]  it's the nature of it just trying to run my operation and manage everything and
[16:03.360 --> 16:09.360]  I got a great crew puts up with my crap and it's just so real for me okay I
[16:09.360 --> 16:12.880]  mean I can't go to a place and eat you know chicken wings and drink beer and
[16:12.880 --> 16:17.120]  have a good time anymore most of the time I can't unplug from this because I
[16:17.120 --> 16:21.600]  know there's a scientific technocracy that's published thousands of times
[16:21.600 --> 16:25.320]  what they're doing to me and you and I read stuff they wrote a hundred years
[16:25.320 --> 16:29.680]  ago and 50 years ago and 20 years ago and five years ago and a week ago all
[16:29.680 --> 16:36.000]  admitting what they're doing to us and it's a fact it isn't my opinion and they
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.640]  think you're so stupid maybe they know something I don't know I don't think
[16:39.640 --> 16:43.760]  you're that dumb that they get up there and say we said the meteor was was was
[16:43.760 --> 16:49.640]  the US government and we made up 1.6 billion bullets but I told the truth
[16:49.640 --> 16:58.920]  he's a cook but it's true but it's a cook and and I'm saying Dorner's a hero I
[16:58.920 --> 17:04.840]  mean this is sick this is sick and and what's happened is people wonder how
[17:04.840 --> 17:09.440]  Nazi Germany could get so crazy or how Soviet Russia to get so crazy or Maoist
[17:09.440 --> 17:15.240]  China or Pol Pot's Cambodia and it's done by increments what we'll put up with
[17:15.240 --> 17:18.960]  the corrupt the insane the out of control get us to put up with more and
[17:18.960 --> 17:23.240]  more and now they're like yeah we torture people yeah we'll secretly arrest
[17:23.240 --> 17:26.000]  you yeah we're running checkpoints yeah we're gonna legalize all the illegals
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.800]  yeah we give 85 billion dollars a month and just one form of payment to foreign
[17:29.800 --> 17:34.040]  banks who then just destroy the money they just they're not even paying off
[17:34.040 --> 17:37.920]  their debts they just want to hurt us and they just take the money and then
[17:37.920 --> 17:41.880]  disappear it it doesn't even use a prop up that their own derivatives that's
[17:41.880 --> 17:46.160]  already been written off by them and they want to make us poor and here's
[17:46.160 --> 17:50.760]  where they said it and you know Maury strong a post-industrial world Al Gore
[17:50.760 --> 17:57.120]  you know CNN depression is good for the earth because it lowers the carbon
[17:57.120 --> 18:01.160]  footprint austerity is a good thing except for them and it's so frustrating
[18:01.160 --> 18:09.320]  that they'll sit there on CNN and say Dorner's a superhero because he's an
[18:09.320 --> 18:15.080]  anti-gun person and an Obama supporter and then they'll spin it back around the
[18:15.080 --> 18:19.720]  next day this is Friday and I watch and just found the club it's going up at
[18:19.720 --> 18:24.600]  info wars.com and it really freaks me out not that they're even going after me
[18:24.600 --> 18:27.760]  the fact that they're trying to discredit me right now first they ignore you then
[18:27.760 --> 18:31.280]  they attack you then you win of course that's sometimes first they ignore you
[18:31.280 --> 18:34.360]  then they attack you then they assassinate you they're trying to
[18:34.360 --> 18:38.120]  assassinate my character and if that doesn't work folks they will set me up
[18:38.120 --> 18:44.240]  but don't think I lose in that okay I win by engaging the enemy but just
[18:44.240 --> 18:49.240]  understand these are dirt bags okay these are people who work for foreign
[18:49.240 --> 18:53.080]  megabanks who want to destroy this country and our future and disarm you
[18:53.080 --> 18:56.480]  and take your pension funds and by the way that's being announced now and they
[18:56.480 --> 19:00.400]  are sitting there cold-bloodedly put on these shows because they will make out
[19:00.400 --> 19:06.320]  landed statements like I support and I'm helping Chris Dorner kill people I'm
[19:06.320 --> 19:11.680]  gonna play that clip coming up that's how stupid they think you are and let me
[19:11.680 --> 19:15.800]  tell you something the media whores the globalist prostitutes over at CNN let

[19:40.400 --> 19:48.600]  climate like this this guy was a statist out of control Obama worshiper and you

[24:14.920 --> 24:22.160]  phrase socialist and collectivist as the renegades but in truth the mega rich in
[24:22.160 --> 24:27.840]  the last 150 years have always funded on record the socialist to be the renegades
[24:27.840 --> 24:31.800]  to collectivize wealth to make sure there's a big centralized government
[24:31.800 --> 24:36.160]  that can easily be bought off and controlled generally because the
[24:36.160 --> 24:39.520]  globalists finance the revolution and then of the centralized government
[24:39.520 --> 24:44.360]  doesn't play ball they can simply pay off officers of the system under that
[24:44.360 --> 24:50.360]  dictator to take them out and that's why the globalist favor a centralized
[24:50.360 --> 24:55.760]  authoritarian system and that's what Carol Quigley wrote in his seminal 1100
[24:55.760 --> 25:00.240]  plus page book tragedy and hope while at Georgetown working for the council on
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.640]  foreign relations and the Bilderberg group by the way we sell the book at
[25:04.640 --> 25:09.560]  info or shop dot com if you're a reader and actually want to read how things
[25:09.560 --> 25:13.880]  work and how their plan was to make the left and right look different each
[25:13.880 --> 25:18.840]  election but in the outcome there be very little difference so they own both
[25:18.840 --> 25:23.440]  candidates okay let's stop right there if you notice up at drudge report dot
[25:23.440 --> 25:30.680]  com right now it talks about massive increases in the price of gas in the
[25:30.680 --> 25:38.200]  last 32 days it's been rising straight 51 cents on average nationally two months
[25:38.200 --> 25:43.880]  in a row and the question is why is this happening the dollar is being
[25:43.880 --> 25:51.600]  devalued that's why 15 years ago fuel was what less than a dollar a gallon and
[25:51.600 --> 25:58.800]  now on average it's almost four dollars some areas it's as much as 599 if you
[25:58.800 --> 26:03.040]  also look at drudge report dot com everybody's favorite news site right in
[26:03.040 --> 26:08.640]  the middle column red linked homeland security advances plan for public
[26:08.640 --> 26:12.600]  safety drones and that is one of our top stories I'm going to get to after
[26:12.600 --> 26:17.880]  media demonization in the next segment and it's simply Paul Watson writing
[26:17.880 --> 26:22.880]  about homeland security announcing what we wrote about a year ago was it
[26:22.880 --> 26:26.600]  actually back in February of last year we shoot another story on this we wrote
[26:26.600 --> 26:31.280]  about homeland security announcing the plan to launch 30,000 drones in the FAA
[26:31.280 --> 26:40.400]  $46 billion of funding by the year 2020 phasing them in starting in 2013 and how
[26:40.400 --> 26:44.520]  they were already using drones to arrest cattle wrestlers in North Dakota and
[26:44.520 --> 26:48.560]  using drones to surveil cold cold power plants and other things and so we wrote
[26:48.560 --> 26:51.920]  an article Curtin Emma wrote an article so the poll and the media came out and
[26:51.920 --> 26:57.720]  said there is no drones there are no drones Alex Jones is insane of course
[26:57.720 --> 27:01.600]  it's always Alex Jones is insane or Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist
[27:01.600 --> 27:04.800]  making this up it was Curtin Emma and Paul Watson just writing off the federal
[27:04.800 --> 27:08.400]  register and announcements I mean that's where we go get the news okay let's go
[27:08.400 --> 27:11.520]  see how many more hundred million bullets they bought okay they bought
[27:11.520 --> 27:15.080]  another hundred million two days ago we missed that we'll write an article you
[27:15.080 --> 27:21.000]  know I mean this is not rocket science and then they come out and say it doesn't
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.760]  exist and the reason I'm covering this is on a scale of one to ten maybe five
[27:26.760 --> 27:33.960]  six years ago was about a two now the attacks are at about a nine every day
[27:33.960 --> 27:37.880]  what they call the mainstream news the the the media whores reading off
[27:37.880 --> 27:46.320]  teleprompters get more crazy and I predicted this last week I said they
[27:46.320 --> 27:51.120]  will blame us for Dorner somehow and they will say that we are conspiracy
[27:51.120 --> 27:57.520]  theorists just using that term that we are conspiracy theorists for saying that
[27:57.520 --> 28:02.360]  the police said burn that mother effort down burn that house down okay we place
[28:02.360 --> 28:08.520]  the burners okay they're on fire we have a fire good mission completed those are
[28:08.520 --> 28:13.080]  quotes mission completed okay we have the burners we placed them we've ignited
[28:13.080 --> 28:18.240]  them they're on fire we have fire there is a fire the walls are collapsing mission
[28:18.240 --> 28:23.200]  accomplished that's the full quote Mike Adams have an article over the weekend
[28:23.200 --> 28:26.880]  at natural news comm saying how do you know if you're in a trance or not and
[28:26.880 --> 28:31.040]  it's a test you you know you watch this video you hear them say all this six
[28:31.040 --> 28:35.600]  different videos now saying similar things and the media tells you you
[28:35.600 --> 28:41.000]  didn't just hear them burn it down I mean this is reached total complete
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.480]  delusional levels and sure enough sure enough they've come out and said they
[28:47.480 --> 28:53.120]  didn't burn it down and that I made it up and that that aids Dorner we're gonna
[28:53.120 --> 28:56.680]  play that clip coming back in the next segment and then we'll get into all the
[28:56.680 --> 29:06.160]  other news but this is the type of over-the-top bizarreness that we're
[29:06.160 --> 29:09.120]  talking about and the thing is it's getting worse and people that are
[29:09.120 --> 29:12.600]  acclimated and have gotten where they accept it they'll buy anything now
[29:12.600 --> 29:20.720]  they'll go along with anything it's incredible I mean it's like telling the
[29:20.720 --> 29:23.360]  three-year-old Santa Claus exists and they believe it because they trust you
[29:23.360 --> 29:29.920]  but you see there's less and less people that trust CNN and MSNBC which
[29:29.920 --> 29:35.040]  are absolute merchants of deception and they think you're idiots we're gonna
[29:35.040 --> 29:38.520]  play those clips when we come back stay with us

[33:39.120 --> 33:41.760]  pundits saying you know the guy's turning into a hero we're gonna play that
[33:41.760 --> 33:47.760]  clip in a moment now this woman from the Daily Beast were Buzz Bissinger comes
[33:47.760 --> 33:53.800]  from I guess that's the division of Newsweek isn't it yeah yeah and he's
[33:53.800 --> 33:58.640]  over at Buzzfeed they contributes to them saying I should be shot on Piers
[33:58.640 --> 34:04.840]  Morgan and then the daughter of Ambassador Huntsman agrees and says
[34:04.840 --> 34:09.400]  appears you can wear a uniform baby and he's like oh yeah I will I mean what a
[34:09.400 --> 34:15.040]  bunch of weirdos somebody says we ought to shoot Alex Jones yeah you can wear a
[34:15.040 --> 34:19.760]  uniform Piers yeah I could I mean what weirdo who has that on the top of their
[34:19.760 --> 34:24.080]  mind yeah you could wear it see they get off on the power of the state putting on
[34:24.080 --> 34:28.840]  the power of the state these are status these are sick us the last thing if I
[34:28.840 --> 34:33.400]  was talking about killing somebody I do is a talk about killing somebody and be
[34:33.400 --> 34:38.640]  I wouldn't say I'll wear a uniform to do it I'm gonna kill some I don't wear the
[34:38.640 --> 34:42.560]  uniform of righteousness and self-defense and it's not something I'm
[34:42.560 --> 34:47.440]  happy I have to do but I will do it with as much proficiency as I can and I
[34:47.440 --> 34:51.480]  certainly am not gonna talk about it Buzz Bissinger but that's because you
[34:51.480 --> 34:55.480]  don't have the will to kill people you want the police and military to go out
[34:55.480 --> 34:59.200]  and bring in your tyranny and do it for you the useful idiot of the New World
[34:59.200 --> 35:02.960]  Order you better hope the new order didn't come in you little Prozac head he
[35:02.960 --> 35:06.000]  admits he's on a bunch of psychotropic says he's mentally ill now to defend
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.240]  himself why I want to be killed see he's so crazy he doesn't want anybody else
[35:10.240 --> 35:16.240]  to have guns because he's so neurotic and weird he doesn't have any control I'm
[35:16.240 --> 35:22.440]  sorry I'm ranting so I've got AP I've got Atlantic wire you know I'm a
[35:22.440 --> 35:26.160]  conspiracy theorist about the bullets not that they're buying them I'm just
[35:26.160 --> 35:30.740]  still bad to be worried about it the arms build up and that I said that the
[35:30.740 --> 35:34.360]  US attacked Russia I didn't say that I said that that was a conspiracy theory
[35:34.360 --> 35:39.200]  and made up and it looked like a stone me or I to me we wrote articles clearly
[35:39.200 --> 35:46.000]  debunking it that matter just say we did it and continuing we've got singing and
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.720]  saying I supported Dorner and I'm and I'm helping make him a foe key where we're
[35:49.720 --> 35:52.880]  gonna play that in a minute while they're the ones two days before actually
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.960]  saying that and the guy is an Obama supporter on record who believes only the
[35:57.960 --> 36:01.520]  government should have guns but he's out kidnapping and killing people and the
[36:01.520 --> 36:04.040]  problem is we'll never know that's a hundred percent true even though it looks
[36:04.040 --> 36:06.480]  like it's a real story because he would come up with something like that the
[36:06.480 --> 36:09.960]  discredits the system you can tell when something scripted they have the script
[36:09.960 --> 36:13.560]  day one this script was all over the place a lot of other points but they
[36:13.560 --> 36:19.400]  burned him alive and said they'd burning and so I'm aiding him because my
[36:19.400 --> 36:25.000]  lying ears and lying eyes saw them and heard them say they burn it down she
[36:25.000 --> 36:32.960]  common sense is the enemy like Rod Serling wrote that twilight zone episode
[36:32.960 --> 36:37.040]  the obsolete man and they call him in and the guys the librarian they're
[36:37.040 --> 36:41.200]  getting rid of books that's what and getting rid of knowledge that's what
[36:41.200 --> 36:44.960]  centralized systems always do in their final phase is logic is an enemy and
[36:44.960 --> 36:48.880]  truth is a menace and that's what Rod Serling wrote and it's true we're
[36:48.880 --> 36:53.000]  watching the obsolete man was a little kid in Dallas and they had reruns on TV
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.760]  and it's you know Rod Serling fought in World War two he was a commando and he
[36:58.760 --> 37:02.480]  was a patriot he was anti-tyrant now I've gone back and pulled up old news
[37:02.480 --> 37:07.000]  articles with Rod Serling criticizing Karen in the US just a great guy before
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.680]  he died of lung cancer and you know he saw coming a million miles away what I
[37:11.680 --> 37:16.120]  saw a thousand miles away what I saw 20 years ago and got involved politically
[37:16.120 --> 37:20.440]  and got on air 17 years ago in 1995 now I guess a little more than 17 years ago
[37:20.440 --> 37:26.120]  almost 18 years ago Rod Serling saw it a million miles away but I guess not
[37:26.120 --> 37:29.040]  really because he'd been in the middle of it they experienced it in Europe like
[37:29.040 --> 37:35.360]  my grandfather did and then I saw the tyranny a thousand miles away and now
[37:35.360 --> 37:41.120]  the tyranny is in our living room and it's sitting on us and people are like
[37:41.120 --> 37:44.520]  well I can learn to let it sit on me folks it's not gonna sit on you forever
[37:44.520 --> 37:50.600]  it's gonna eat you like a cave troll eats a hobbit like a piece of mutton
[37:50.600 --> 37:56.680]  we've got to get these people back in the box we've got to get control of the
[37:56.680 --> 38:01.080]  situation we've got to get them to back down and back off because I'm here to
[38:01.080 --> 38:04.600]  tell you I studied tyrants I studied history they're not going to make it
[38:04.600 --> 38:09.520]  they're not gonna get this done the way they want okay nine times out of ten
[38:09.520 --> 38:14.200]  tyrannies end up taking over but then wanting to dominate everything the same
[38:14.200 --> 38:19.960]  control freak instinct that got them into power is what undoes them because now
[38:19.960 --> 38:23.000]  they're in power they should just sit back and lay back let's see they don't
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.960]  want to do that they want control of everything they want to impoverish
[38:26.960 --> 38:30.920]  people because it makes them feel good they don't want the wealth just to be
[38:30.920 --> 38:34.720]  comfortable and to be able to do cool things and create things and help others
[38:34.720 --> 38:39.840]  and and see their ideas manifest that's what's fun about wealth if you're a good
[38:39.840 --> 38:45.120]  person they use wealth as a tool of control and they don't like seeing you
[38:45.120 --> 38:52.840]  having it in electoral wealth physical health wealth spiritual wealth sexual
[38:52.840 --> 38:57.560]  wealth they don't like it they don't like it they don't like it they don't
[38:57.560 --> 39:04.480]  like it sleeping beauty the evil queen the witch queen up on the mountaintops
[39:04.480 --> 39:08.760]  got her own palace her own servants but she's unhappy and she doesn't like
[39:08.760 --> 39:13.840]  watching the little happy kingdom down the hill down the hill in the valley
[39:13.840 --> 39:18.000]  with all the happy people and all the good things it sounds like nails on a
[39:18.000 --> 39:25.440]  chalkboard to her and so she comes down there to so poison and to so pain and to
[39:25.440 --> 39:30.440]  put the spirit of liberty and the spirit of ingenuity and the spirit of
[39:30.440 --> 39:36.960]  renewal into a deep sleep but it takes a prince who's willing to ride into the
[39:36.960 --> 39:44.600]  dark forest and face the dangers to kiss beauty to kiss liberty and to re
[39:44.600 --> 39:56.640]  affirm the covenant and to release the spirit of creation God is there waiting
[39:56.640 --> 40:02.720]  but God is not like the destroyer the devil the deceiver God gives us free
[40:02.720 --> 40:13.960]  will we have to choose we have to choose to hear the voice and then we have to go
[40:13.960 --> 40:20.000]  on the quest see all the children's fables and parables are actually allegories
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.160]  to real life you must first conquer yourself and then you must conquer the
[40:26.160 --> 40:31.240]  New World Order the entire Bible but but all cultural history is about the
[40:31.240 --> 40:35.760]  individual who is good not wanting to stand up not wanting power but having
[40:35.760 --> 40:40.440]  to stand up and having to take power from the evil to defeat it and that's
[40:40.440 --> 40:45.360]  where we stand we've got to get up off the couch get off the porch move over
[40:45.360 --> 40:51.320]  little dog the big dogs coming to town in fact we have that Hank Williams song
[40:51.320 --> 40:54.560]  somewhere can we come back out of the next break playing move over a little
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.760]  dog big dog I forget the name of the actual song we've actually got it in
[40:59.760 --> 41:06.480]  the computer but we have to realize we're the big dog and we have to act
[41:06.480 --> 41:10.200]  like the big dog because the little dog knows he's a little dog and he doesn't
[41:10.200 --> 41:13.080]  like a big dog you're like well I'll let the little dog run things little dog
[41:13.080 --> 41:18.040]  don't want you to just sit there little dog wants you dead little dog wants to
[41:18.040 --> 41:21.560]  run you off a cliff little dog isn't gonna sit there looking at you much
[41:21.560 --> 41:27.440]  better than him little dog wants you dead you get that straight big dog got to
[41:27.440 --> 41:32.640]  act like big dog big dog got to be big dog or big dog gonna be dead dog you
[41:32.640 --> 41:43.080]  got that move over little dog big dogs coming in it's either big dog or it's
[41:43.080 --> 41:47.120]  tearing under little dog you either be the big dog or you live under little
[41:47.120 --> 41:52.040]  dog and little dog wants to do one thing piss on you all day excuse me I just
[41:52.040 --> 41:55.720]  only way to break that down ladies and gentlemen does it make sense and I hear
[41:55.720 --> 42:02.400]  an amen out there all right all right listen it's a real sign of desperation
[42:02.400 --> 42:07.120]  seeing in again I don't normally we're in the news every day newspapers TV but
[42:07.120 --> 42:11.920]  I don't maybe one out of 20 times I actually cover stuff the website covers
[42:11.920 --> 42:17.840]  about half the time but I rarely cover things about us but by rarely it's
[42:17.840 --> 42:21.320]  pretty much every couple days but but it's it's it's it's rare one out of 20
[42:21.320 --> 42:30.520]  times or so to cover it it's just coming to such a head right now it's
[42:30.520 --> 42:36.880]  coming to such a head right now that we know we're hurting them bad and we know
[42:36.880 --> 42:41.000]  seeing an MSNBC our official White House mouthpieces show as media matters and
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.280]  they are just savaging yours truly they're savaging things like drudge
[42:45.280 --> 42:49.680]  report.com because they know that's what's hitting them they know out of the
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.040]  whole spectrum of resistance that what's really finding the chink in the
[42:54.040 --> 42:58.320]  armor what's really fine in the missing scales on the belly of this snake are
[42:58.320 --> 43:02.880]  people that just call it like it is you're a bunch of paramilitary thugs
[43:02.880 --> 43:06.520]  want to be thugs trying to get our military and police to act like that a
[43:06.520 --> 43:11.320]  bunch of globalists trying to conquer us and the fact that my talking points
[43:11.320 --> 43:18.320]  which are just the truth the historical prima facie open truth are now making
[43:18.320 --> 43:24.600]  their way into other publications other talk shows Paul Craig Roberts had an
[43:24.600 --> 43:28.040]  article last week about it it already happened here the tyranny did come here
[43:28.040 --> 43:33.640]  he had another article out today with America a colonized country by the
[43:33.640 --> 43:37.760]  globalist by the mega banks and again it's not just Paul Craig Roberts it's
[43:37.760 --> 43:42.520]  it's it's it's it's hundreds of other shows I hear I run into on talk radio it's
[43:42.520 --> 43:48.160]  media I mean really people are starting to get it I hear people in restaurants
[43:48.160 --> 43:51.600]  talking who don't even know who I am about you know it's the mega rich that
[43:51.600 --> 43:56.280]  are actually trying to shut things down to take over and consolidate it I'm
[43:56.280 --> 44:01.160]  starting to hear that all over the place and it's game over for the occupiers
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.960]  when people figure out hey why are we paying 85 billion to foreign banks not
[44:04.960 --> 44:07.960]  even our debt every every month but then we're being told we got to raise our
[44:07.960 --> 44:12.560]  taxes to pay off debt that in ours as soon as that begins to happen it's game
[44:12.560 --> 44:16.640]  over folks and as soon as people don't believe the system anymore it won't
[44:16.640 --> 44:20.240]  matter of the globalist nuke a city and say patriots did it no one's gonna buy
[44:20.240 --> 44:23.840]  it no one's gonna line up and go along with it see they're losing their hoax
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.680]  power and they're listening right now this is freaking them out that we know
[44:27.680 --> 44:31.560]  they're killers we know they stage fast and furious we know they staged other
[44:31.560 --> 44:36.040]  events we know they're running al-qaeda and living in Syria we know they killed
[44:36.040 --> 44:39.840]  the ambassador to cover up the missile shipments we know we know and they're
[44:39.840 --> 44:43.640]  like what do we do this crazy Texan will just tell it like it is he doesn't care
[44:43.640 --> 44:49.240]  if we kill him the truth is I absolutely do care I don't want to die I love life
[44:49.240 --> 44:55.120]  so much is just but but I'm a lot more concerned about you guys winning and
[44:55.120 --> 44:58.480]  hurting a lot of innocent people than I'm about my own lives but that's why I
[44:58.480 --> 45:01.960]  get so angry at you and that's why I'm asking listeners to get angry at these
[45:01.960 --> 45:07.800]  people these are usurper criminals running all over us in our face and
[45:07.800 --> 45:11.400]  they're a joke they're a fraud now let's start going to these clips here's the
[45:11.400 --> 45:17.080]  first one CNN pundits says Alex Jones turned Dorner into a hero and they're
[45:17.080 --> 45:21.200]  talking about the piece two days before we're one of their pundits CNN panel
[45:21.200 --> 45:24.920]  Dorner's alleged murder spree exciting like Denzel Washington movie they're
[45:24.920 --> 45:28.720]  saying you know he was wrong to say that so they're backtracking and then they
[45:28.720 --> 45:33.080]  spin it and go well it's Alex Jones saying they burned him up he's the one
[45:33.080 --> 45:38.240]  making Dorner a hero all I'm doing is here in six different tapes different
[45:38.240 --> 45:41.440]  feeds different tapes we've played three or four of them gotta play all six
[45:41.440 --> 45:46.120]  where they're like burn that house down burn down the house okay bring the fire
[45:46.120 --> 45:53.200]  okay we've got the burners okay they're in place okay there is fire okay walls
[45:53.200 --> 45:59.680]  collapsing mission complete I mean that'd be like if humbees were pulling up
[45:59.680 --> 46:02.320]  to a house shoot them they said swing those 50s around take out that house
[46:02.320 --> 46:05.840]  take out those shooters and you think that they kill the shooters then go we
[46:05.840 --> 46:10.480]  we didn't shoot anybody you're like what are you talking about I mean it'd be like
[46:10.480 --> 46:14.360]  if they said shotgun formation and called out the plays you saw the shotgun
[46:14.360 --> 46:18.520]  formation you didn't just see a shotgun formation you I mean they talked to you
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.880]  I know I keep marveling about this I just it's so amazing and to know that I
[46:22.880 --> 46:28.400]  predicted it not because it's hard it's so elementary how they attack because
[46:28.400 --> 46:36.520]  they know their audience only the dumbest of the dumb suspended disbelief
[46:36.520 --> 46:48.680]  rubes suckers idiots morons smucks marks fools twits what's other words for
[46:48.680 --> 46:53.420]  just totally stupid gullible useful idiots willfully ignorant pathetic
[46:53.420 --> 46:59.640]  losers begging to be conned just I just don't understand the religion of being
[46:59.640 --> 47:04.960]  conned and reveling in your ignorance let's go to the clip what's this idiots
[47:04.960 --> 47:13.680]  name again you remember everything CJ yeah Leah Lauren Ashburn let's professor
[47:13.680 --> 47:16.840]  no no no that we're not gonna pay professor Mark Lamont first we're gonna
[47:16.840 --> 47:22.440]  play singing in pundits say Alex Jones turned Dorner into a hero okay let's go
[47:22.440 --> 47:25.920]  and play that clip right now okay but just briefly Kelly I've got to have a
[47:25.920 --> 47:29.520]  minute or do we in the media are we giving too much attention to his views
[47:29.520 --> 47:33.480]  when he is a mass murderer look I believe that the media always gives too much
[47:33.480 --> 47:36.400]  attention to the criminals and not enough attention to the victims I mean how
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.040]  many of us can actually name say the full first and last names of the people
[47:40.040 --> 47:42.760]  that were victims of this man and that's a tragedy and I think that's what the
[47:42.760 --> 47:45.880]  failure of the media but I think I will say that I think is a larger story here
[47:45.880 --> 47:49.720]  Howard is that these types of stories really feed into the sort of paranoia
[47:49.720 --> 47:52.960]  of the friend right of the people of the Alex Jones of the world when you have
[47:52.960 --> 47:56.000]  this whole debate about the audio of that we've I know that has been covered
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.560]  about whether or not the LAPD had planned to burn this man out and
[47:58.560 --> 48:02.920]  unfortunately that's what sort of gives credence to people to say aha see I
[48:02.920 --> 48:06.280]  told you so the mainstream media and the LAPD they're not giving us the full
[48:06.280 --> 48:09.280]  information that's what gives credence and credibility and makes heroes out of
[48:09.280 --> 48:12.200]  people like Chris Dorner that's the tragedy of the way this was covered I
[48:12.200 --> 48:15.360]  believe all right Kelly Gotham will Cain very lively discussion
[48:15.360 --> 48:21.200]  Kelly Goth saying that so so the fact that my lying eyes and lying ears saw
[48:21.200 --> 48:24.440]  and heard them over and over again say burn him up burn the house down and
[48:24.440 --> 48:27.840]  then they do it and their answers listen you're a conspiracy theorist and you're
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.480]  helping Dorner when it's CNN another panel with the Daily Beast people saying
[48:32.480 --> 48:38.040]  things like this let's go ahead and go to the clip from two days earlier on CNN
[48:38.040 --> 48:42.960]  Chris Dorner is like watching Django getting revenge or Denzel Washington
[48:42.960 --> 48:46.520]  movie here it is there's no waste here though I mean this has been an important
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.040]  public conversation that we've had about police brutality about police
[48:51.040 --> 48:54.160]  corruption about state violence and there was there even talks about making
[48:54.160 --> 48:57.840]  him the first domestic drone target I mean this is serious business I don't
[48:57.840 --> 49:01.000]  think it's been a waste of time at all and as far as Dorner himself goes he's
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.640]  been like a real life superhero to many people now don't get me wrong what he
[49:04.640 --> 49:08.840]  did was awful killing innocent teachers bad but when you read his manifesto when
[49:08.840 --> 49:12.560]  you read the message that he left he wasn't entirely crazy he had a plan and
[49:12.560 --> 49:16.680]  mission here and that's enough to kill innocent people they're rooting for you
[49:16.680 --> 49:19.400]  know you know what yeah they're rooting for somebody they see is going after
[49:19.400 --> 49:23.440]  corruption was what he wanted to say you see the video up at info wars.com but
[49:23.440 --> 49:30.600]  the point is that if you see a cop beat somebody and then you criticize it and
[49:30.600 --> 49:36.040]  get fired that's wrong sue go to the media whatever didn't do any of that
[49:36.040 --> 49:42.680]  you believe the official story and then you go out and you shoot somebody's
[49:42.680 --> 49:46.480]  daughter that's not even the police force to get at them man that's as low as
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.320]  it gets and I got criticized massive criticism not really from our audience
[49:51.320 --> 49:54.720]  but some of the YouTube people and others were like how dare you side with
[49:54.720 --> 49:58.360]  the pigs and things like that you know I don't just demonize a whole group and
[49:58.360 --> 50:08.280]  say their pigs I demonize bad behavior because it demonizes itself and the
[50:08.280 --> 50:11.880]  system wants to divide and conquer they want the police against the people and
[50:11.880 --> 50:15.160]  the people against the police they don't want us waking the police up they want
[50:15.160 --> 50:20.560]  to have this civil war but just because he was an Obama supporter then it's okay
[50:20.560 --> 50:25.000]  to kill cops I guarantee you if one of my listeners killed cops well they tried
[50:25.000 --> 50:28.840]  to blame me before when some guy who hated me some white supremacist killed
[50:28.840 --> 50:34.720]  cops up in Pittsburgh within hours of the shooting they blame me and it turned
[50:34.720 --> 50:37.960]  out the guy hated me and within two hours of having his computer they said
[50:37.960 --> 50:41.760]  well he visited info wars it was Alex Jones' fault again why do they want to
[50:41.760 --> 50:45.760]  frame me why do they want to set us up more of these clips straight ahead

[53:49.320 --> 53:59.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[54:19.320 --> 54:35.440]  we are back live there's Hank Williams the legend dog house that's one of the
[54:35.440 --> 54:39.320]  new houses in San Francisco or New York or they're gonna tax you at such a rate
[54:39.320 --> 54:44.760]  you can only live in a dog house size a gen 21 home I want to get to this other
[54:44.760 --> 54:49.000]  clip I never played this because I didn't see it you know we're literally
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.360]  probably 30 40 shows on CNN alone we're over and over again they demonize me
[54:53.360 --> 55:00.400]  after Pierce Morgan but the same show reliable disinformation reliable fraud
[55:00.400 --> 55:05.440]  excuse me reliable sources by Howard Kurtz he's the main host and I guess
[55:05.440 --> 55:10.560]  producer of the show the head honcho they played clips of where I'd been on
[55:10.560 --> 55:14.560]  Pierce Morgan and then went on to imply oh I'm discrediting we shouldn't even
[55:14.560 --> 55:19.080]  have people like him on but it just it's discrediting and you know he doesn't
[55:19.080 --> 55:23.080]  represent the gun owners why would they have me back on if it's so discrediting
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.160]  the truth is is that it discredited them and just said look you want the guns
[55:27.160 --> 55:30.840]  stop saying you don't want them and it shows though how they're all about
[55:30.840 --> 55:37.760]  dictating reality they say what's credible they control the strictures of
[55:37.760 --> 55:42.520]  reality they sit on the mountain like Moses and they give out the law and then
[55:42.520 --> 55:47.880]  CNN said Alex Jones is a kook and a 9-11 truth or all I ever pointed out is
[55:47.880 --> 55:51.760]  norad stood down and the government brought the al-Qaeda members in and
[55:51.760 --> 55:55.320]  protected him and that was in mainstream news just like they run al-Qaeda today I
[55:55.320 --> 56:00.240]  said that 9-11's being used to take the public's rights not to fire al-Qaeda
[56:00.240 --> 56:05.640]  that's what I said but let's go ahead and play another same reliable sources
[56:05.640 --> 56:11.000]  that says that I'm I'm promoting Dorner total lie you know it's a lie they
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.840]  don't source anything they just lie to you thinking you're stupid here they
[56:14.840 --> 56:18.640]  are yet again and so we're discrediting these fraudsters here it is
[56:18.640 --> 56:23.960]  how did Piers Morgan handle Alex Jones badly the question really is is did
[56:23.960 --> 56:29.480]  anyone at CNN or on Piers Morgan show ever see or hear Alex Jones before they
[56:29.480 --> 56:33.840]  booked him on the show why do you say badly he let him have his say and and
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.800]  Alex Jones he all his views were on display he got steamrolled Piers
[56:37.800 --> 56:43.000]  Morgan's thought he was going to have an Oxford debating style it's debate about
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.880]  gun you really think so what he kept saying it on the air as a matter of fact
[56:45.880 --> 56:51.760]  and Alex doesn't play by the Piers Morgan always interrupts Alex Jones is a
[56:51.760 --> 56:56.400]  monologist he will go on and on and on right but what Piers Morgan said he's
[56:56.400 --> 57:02.000]  interviewed on CBS he says that you expose the ridiculousness in his view
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.320]  he's an advocate on this issue of gun control ridiculousness of people like
[57:05.320 --> 57:08.920]  Alex Jones by putting them on the air letting them rant and rave he said you
[57:08.920 --> 57:12.320]  know this has been viewed 5 million times on YouTube it certainly has got a
[57:12.320 --> 57:15.720]  lot of attention yeah that's right and it's been great for Alex Jones I'm sure
[57:15.720 --> 57:19.600]  that his ratings on his radio show will go up tremendously as a result of it
[57:19.600 --> 57:23.400]  not really go ahead Kelly can I just agree a little bit I actually would say
[57:23.400 --> 57:26.840]  that if you're examining this as a contest between who got to say more
[57:26.840 --> 57:30.680]  words than yes Alex Jones won if you're examining this as a contest between who
[57:30.680 --> 57:34.720]  came across looking more sane than Piers Morgan one and I have to say I've heard
[57:34.720 --> 57:37.600]  from a lot of people who aren't Piers Morgan fans who didn't never thought he
[57:37.600 --> 57:40.720]  was saying before who would say begrudgingly like I'm mad at Alex
[57:40.720 --> 57:44.160]  Jones because he made me have to defend and like and and cheer for Piers
[57:44.160 --> 57:47.600]  Morgan that's good we're gonna play more of it later after I get into the main
[57:47.600 --> 57:50.960]  news and take your calls there's a bunch of other news but they tried to put that
[57:50.960 --> 57:54.360]  spin out this discredits them but then now they don't want to air the clips
[57:54.360 --> 57:58.760]  anymore they don't want to have me on because I called their bluff our four
[57:58.760 --> 58:03.640]  bearers went and shot and killed people that tried to take their guns they
[58:03.640 --> 58:08.880]  rode down the street saying get your guns start killing people now I get up
[58:08.880 --> 58:12.440]  there and I say hey you want our guns don't lie they've introduced all the
[58:12.440 --> 58:18.280]  legislation stop lying you want the guns I'm like Paul Revere but Paul Revere
[58:18.280 --> 58:24.040]  totally wimpy not saying kill people I'm like hey wake up you're a fraud it did
[58:24.040 --> 58:27.880]  wake people up now we're winning the gun debate that's a big part of it calling

[1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:35.000]  that guy was in custody like eight years before he started confessing and they
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.160]  and they bragged yeah and we brought his kids into torture and he finally broke

[1:04:19.280 --> 1:04:22.960]  magazine free out at businesses and what's shocking shocking is the
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:27.680]  magazines are actually staying there now six months you know they've been
[1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:31.640]  accepting them six different issues and you know he'll say we're conspiracy

[1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:23.840]  number two thank you so much for joining us today I'm gonna go for some of our
[1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:26.880]  top stories and then get the number out and take your calls some of the
[1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:31.600]  headlines and info wars calm we've got to defend ourselves CNN pundit Alex Jones
[1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:36.960]  made Chris Dorner a hero you have heard us from day one say that if he indeed
[1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:44.080]  did this he is a monster of the highest order you never target people's families
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:51.120]  as supposedly retribution for a cop beating somebody up two wrongs don't
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:55.920]  make a right you don't go kill people's children media blames Alex Jones for
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:59.680]  meteor conspiracy theories you know we don't normally cover ourselves even
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:03.480]  when the Pierce Morgan thing happened we didn't talk about it that much we've
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:07.920]  been forced now they're saying we said the US government attacked Russia
[1:09:07.920 --> 1:09:13.400]  Atlantic wire and others just incredible fabrications when we're on my
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:17.200]  entire crew none of my writers everyone you said it was a stone meteorite
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:22.320]  fragment from DA 14 more of them been seen coming over California Florida
[1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:27.600]  Australia you name it Cuba we're on record many of you heard the show
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:32.360]  Friday there's full archives of it in the podcast video archives at info wars
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:39.760]  news.com and present planet dot TV YouTube I mean it's certain point I'm not
[1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:46.480]  really a litigious person but you know to sue CNN for saying I made Dorner a
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:51.080]  hero and then I'm supporting Dorner when I said the opposite I mean at a
[1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:54.920]  certain point you've got to illustrate what they're doing is defamatory and
[1:09:54.920 --> 1:09:59.040]  they're doing this desperately now I mean I'm getting attacked by CNN every
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:05.960]  couple days and it's always whole cloth made up so they're saying AP is
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:09.200]  basically saying I'm making up the 1.6 billion bullets but then admitting it's
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:12.480]  true and that's been circulated and literally hundreds of newspapers
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:16.480]  conservatively and on Fox News has covered it this is all the last three
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:20.680]  days they're saying I support Dorner you know that's a fraud total fraud that
[1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:24.280]  course they don't play a clip either but that's always a telltale sign people
[1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:28.040]  say something but don't show proof I say Obama promised not to raise any taxes
[1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:31.560]  under a quarter million dollars no payroll tax whatever I have the clip in
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:35.080]  fact I want to play that again later will you cue that up please thank you if I
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:40.760]  say that Diane Feinstein said that if she could have all the guns banned Mr.
[1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:46.000]  and Mrs. America turn them in I play the clip you know if I say that the White
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.320]  House science are said something I tell you what book he said it in
[1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:54.280]  eco science said you know put sterilants in the water see you go to info wars
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:58.120]  dot com article or prison planet dot com article it's new radically filled with
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:06.520]  links and videos new radically when you look at New York Times CNN the ever see
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:12.280]  links almost never they just tell you Alex Jones and this by the way was on
[1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:18.920]  CNN to CNN Atlantic wire a bunch of other publications that I said the US
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:24.040]  government attacked Russia with a meteorite or a kinetic weapon where did I
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:31.120]  say this didn't put articles out saying that was disinformation they say I said
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:36.080]  that and again it isn't about Alex Jones they know that we represent what's left
[1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:40.360]  of America we understand the globalist we know their game plan we have millions
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:44.360]  of listeners we're growing exponentially they want to assassinate our character
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:48.960]  with the average Sally soccer mom that's who watches CNN on average about 108
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:53.200]  thousand viewers total shadow of itself but still it has authority with some
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:11:58.840]  bumpkins and they also take CNN clips and the derivatives of it actually gets
[1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:02.400]  seen on other shows so that's where their real audience is and online their
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:07.560]  YouTube audience their web audience is probably bigger than their TV audience
[1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:12.560]  yeah we'll play that Obama clip in a minute not yet thanks and so all of this
[1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:17.920]  is going on and remember last year they said there is no plan for DHS to launch
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:23.400]  drones info wars.com curtain MO Matt drudge of drudge report.com this is
[1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:26.600]  this is last year with that I was telling the shoe articles on this this
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:31.680]  morning Paul Watson did one DHS advances plan for public safety drones
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:39.040]  that's a quote and we're linked to the homeland securities press release at the
[1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:44.160]  wrong button let's go back to info wars it's linked to their statements okay now
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:48.480]  last year we said this but it got picked up in the news a lot of farming
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:52.080]  associations got concerned because they were surveilling farmers and so they
[1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:58.760]  ran hoax articles saying again as we first reported last July and then
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:03.800]  there's the link to it and they came out and said we were making it up it didn't
[1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:12.320]  exist even though we were sourced okay so wired magazines reporting it and of
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:16.520]  course their link to the government announcement and DHS is announcing it
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:20.480]  the federal aviation and men administration is announcing it we have
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:25.480]  links to all of that but guaranteed look in the next week because the story is
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:31.880]  going big right now that they'll come out and say I'm crazy there are no drones
[1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:35.600]  and you may see one fly over your house you didn't see that just like black
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.520]  helicopters people would call me when I first got on air in 95 96 and say man
[1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:42.080]  they're doing urban warfare drills downstairs from my house I have footage
[1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:46.720]  and they send me footage and I put on my local cables show and then in the
[1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:50.680]  local paper call up and say you claim there's black helicopters you claim you
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:53.640]  have footage I'd go meet with the newspaper reporter go here's the
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:57.800]  footage here's the town here's even the local newspaper reporting on it and they
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:01.240]  write an article saying Jones is completely insane it doesn't exist
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:05.520]  remember the New York Times four years ago at Bilderberg covering Hillary and
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:09.880]  Obama there showing footage of the Secret Service all of it later admitted
[1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:13.000]  they were there years later they admitted it the New York Times came out and
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.520]  said that I was having a full-on schizophrenic event it was in a New
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:20.520]  World Order film review for the film New World Order that air on the independent
[1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:30.600]  film channel that they covered it and they imply in the film that well was
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:33.760]  there people meeting there that shows the red carpet the national anthems
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:37.320]  being played I mean we hid in the hotel and got thrown out and shot the world
[1:14:37.320 --> 1:14:42.000]  leaders arriving and the New York Times said I was in the forest by a Marriott
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.840]  having a full-on schizophrenic event imagining black sedans now folks that's
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:51.040]  how dumb the New York Times thinks you are and I know I'm off on a jag on this
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:59.240]  today but you have to understand this propaganda is targeting the the part of
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:07.360]  the population that is in a full-on mind-numbed medical trance and it's
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:11.440]  mainly intelligentsia yuppies that think they're real smart and have a couple
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:14.720]  college degrees and back groceries at the local store because they can't get a
[1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:20.440]  job in the globalist economy but they can sure go to the local coffee shop and
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:25.000]  drink tea and read the newspaper on their iPad and make fun of me because I've
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:29.440]  been around them I've seen it and it's all about you think the drones are getting
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:33.400]  me you think the government's evil well they just secretly arrest and torture
[1:15:33.400 --> 1:15:36.360]  people and are taking out all these countries and putting al-qaeda in them
[1:15:36.360 --> 1:15:40.160]  to blow up all the churches and synagogues and engage in ethnic cleansing of
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:43.600]  the blacks and all this stuff and you know the yeah I mean the government's
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:46.640]  pretty darn bad I mean look all the things they're doing 85 billion in
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:50.280]  taxpayer money given to farm banks every month I mean you know we're on the road
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:54.440]  to collapse I'm like sure we are who but you're hiding I bet you're scared
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:57.960]  and I'm like well actually I'm not
[1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:02.280]  all right look I'm gonna give the number out to take your phone calls the
[1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:12.520]  toll-free number to join us is 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 will get you up and on
[1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:19.840]  the air here today what's happening is it's like I own a restaurant
[1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:23.760]  hypothetically and my restaurant's got better food doesn't mean it's perfect
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:31.280]  but it's better than the rat dropping filled asbestos lined rotting hulk with
[1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:35.880]  roaches walking around at high noon on the on the countertops that CNN that's
[1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:41.880]  MSNBC imploding a joke discredited race-pamping total frauds globalists
[1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:46.800]  running and in my restaurant's got the parking lot full and so they're they're
[1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:51.280]  parading around telling people there's rat droppings in my food but everybody's
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:55.600]  going inside not finding rat droppings and they all know that the real rat
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:17:02.000]  droppings and the mouse traps on the counter are across the street and that's
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  what you'd expect from drought from people that are going under the water
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  people that are about to drown people that are falling apart people that are
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:17.840]  complete scams and hoaxes and frauds and that's what you get out of a rotting
[1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:23.680]  facade a scam and so the fact that they're going into pure lying shows you
[1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:28.200]  that they're going beneath the waves but doesn't matter they still control the
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:31.600]  government they still control the false flag events they could still stage more
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:34.800]  fast and furious to blame the Second Amendment they are very very dangerous
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:40.800]  800-259-9231 we're going to first-time callers by the way I want to give first
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:47.760]  time callers a chance to get involved on air I should add that 800-259-9231
[1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:51.200]  a few of our regular callers got through that's fine they're the first on the
[1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:54.600]  board but I want first-time callers right now ladies and gentlemen to give
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:18:02.280]  them a chance to join us here on air and I've got big economic news I've got
[1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:07.880]  Guantanamo fake trial news I've got just a lot of other important news we're
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:13.560]  going to be getting into today and we have a sheriff joining us who's been on
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:20.480]  Piers Morgan and he's there in the county that Milwaukee's in and I want to
[1:18:20.480 --> 1:18:23.520]  get him on in fact there's so many clips of him he was on most the hour of
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:26.840]  Piers Morgan I want to find the clip where the mayor of Milwaukee's ongoing
[1:18:26.840 --> 1:18:32.840]  you can't comment you don't respond to real events at homes the sheriff goes
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:39.000]  well of course I do in the county but not in the city the mayor says you can't
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:43.040]  respond this is how they deceive and Piers Morgan smiling while the mayor
[1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:48.240]  doesn't who this guy can lie good like me oh it's so good by the way I talked to
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:52.200]  the gun shop owner who was there while Piers Morgan was openly down there a
[1:18:52.200 --> 1:19:00.040]  few weeks ago going all right this is how we're gonna lie I mean they just
[1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:04.800]  think we are so stupid but the point is is the mayor is on there with a sheriff
[1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:10.640]  of Milwaukee County the county the city of Milwaukee's in and he goes you can't
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:14.800]  comment on the guns because your officers your deputies don't respond to
[1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:21.720]  homes and don't respond to crimes and then he adds in Milwaukee knowing most
[1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:25.280]  people are so dumb now they don't know the between city and county that the
[1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:28.720]  two you know that in the county they respond to homes and the sheriff goes
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:33.120]  that's ridiculous of course we respond to homes and we respond to things on the
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:42.440]  edge of the city to homes see they knew full well but again lying to the
[1:19:42.440 --> 1:19:46.120]  audience that's what the mayor was doing so we're gonna talk about that as well
[1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:53.480]  it's all coming up 800-599-231 your freedoms are on the line the second
[1:19:53.480 --> 1:19:57.520]  amendment is in danger how soon before your freedoms are taken away what can

[1:23:56.880 --> 1:24:00.300]  police officers not only in the city of Milwaukee but in the 18 other
[1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:05.320]  municipalities that respond to these calls and to have a sheriff basically
[1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:11.400]  imply that it's not going to help you to call 9-1-1 I think is irresponsible I
[1:24:11.400 --> 1:24:15.120]  mean sheriff you know listening to the way that you phrased yourself in that
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:21.000]  ad the kind of Hollywood voice you put on the deep tones making it all sound
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.880]  terribly exciting and dramatic it sounded like some kind of John Wayne movie
[1:24:24.880 --> 1:24:31.300]  how on earth does that kind of rhetoric to the American people serve any kind of
[1:24:31.300 --> 1:24:40.120]  sensible rational purpose well first of all I object to the Hollywood voice this
[1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:45.280]  is the way I talk this is my voice and that that that ad was recorded at a
[1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:49.440]  studio but let me get back on more to your point first of all as it relates to
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:53.720]  the mayor on a mayor is completely wrong I'm the top law enforcement agency in
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:57.680]  Milwaukee County and we are a full-fledged law enforcement agency and
[1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:01.720]  we respond to everything but that's not the point that's enough could care less
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:07.360]  what that sheriff David Clark is joining us in the next hour I want to go to some
[1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:11.480]  of your phone calls right now then we'll get into Chicago police chief second
[1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:15.240]  amendment is a danger to public safety and they have a California police chief
[1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:20.080]  we have a clip at a gun grabbing meeting press conference saying guns are not for
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:28.120]  self-defense and are never used for self-defense I said we know with FBI
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:33.280]  statistics that crime was down 21% but I was only going from 2007 it's
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:38.360]  accelerated since 1991 FBI.gov and we've shown these statistics over and over
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:42.760]  again except the guys can find them in the computer you can throw them up it's
[1:25:42.760 --> 1:25:51.080]  down 49% violent crime directly relatable to increase in gun ownership so
[1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:56.520]  just amazing to see this type of garbage going on so that's coming up in the
[1:25:56.520 --> 1:26:03.760]  next segment as well Seth in Louisiana you're on the air go ahead hey I was
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:08.040]  the hey Alex how you doing good buddy I was just wondering if you heard about
[1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:18.400]  Philip Marshall back on the 6th he shot his two children his dog and himself yes
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:21.840]  we do know about that and he was involved in all sorts of black ops and
[1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:26.920]  things and had exposed a globalist criminal involvement in 9-11 in a book
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:31.080]  and then had a lot of other national security info I don't think they wanted
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:34.840]  him to leak and so their favorite way to take you out is to kill your wife and
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:39.640]  your children your dog everybody with you and then blame it on you posthumously
[1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:44.680]  and I just want to say I will never do that never never even enter my mind in
[1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:50.160]  a trillion years I've never even touched my wife and so it's just a
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:53.160]  complaint when that is even in my universe but that's one of their
[1:26:53.160 --> 1:26:57.120]  favorite ways to do it there was a state senator in Georgia great lady she'd
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:01.560]  called me a week before and said we have the bombshell info the proof that the
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:07.040]  government documents that they put out select releases through the federal
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:11.640]  government of what type of children they want grabbed for the elite through CPS
[1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:15.840]  and so they put bounties out and she goes I'm ready to come on in about a week
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:19.320]  and I had her on several times I forget her name it'll pop my head in a minute
[1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:23.280]  since you mentioned this and her husband reportedly
[1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:27.600]  suicided each other and then I think there was a fire involved that covers
[1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:33.000]  up fingerprints I mean just come on come on I mean if in a million years folks I
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:37.920]  would never do that my wife wouldn't it's total bull the hitman comes in they
[1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:41.400]  shoot you they kill you God forbid your kids are there they kill them and then
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:46.120]  they set you up in the case of the DC madam they wrote a suicide letter I
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:50.760]  did what the police wouldn't do I called the condo manager in Florida who had
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:53.960]  turned out had been her friend she told me about that off air she lived there
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:59.200]  for a decade or more and I said well you send me her lease well no I talked to
[1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:02.720]  me said this isn't her handwriting on the news because it was a scanned copy on
[1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:05.800]  on the news he said that isn't her handwriting I said well send me her
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:10.640]  lease and he sent me the lease and then request letters for things where she
[1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:14.280]  was out of town directions about her plants and things for the condo she
[1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:19.720]  owned and she said guys are following me I'm getting threats things like that and
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:23.240]  then they murdered her and she was on my show a month before they killed her and
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:26.400]  I said look you better either give them all the info back and tell them you're
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:29.600]  not gonna blow the whistle on them don't try to quote get your good name back I
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:35.000]  said either release it all or destroy it all or they're gonna kill you and she
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:39.760]  thought she was gonna you know parlay that all those politicians she had they
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:45.400]  killed her so yeah no I am familiar with the Philip Marshall case we and by the
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:50.040]  way former NSA officer who's been on the trail of that would give us about a
[1:28:50.040 --> 1:28:53.960]  week or sort of track it and see what the intel is we got Wayne Madsen on
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:57.240]  tomorrow or the next day on the nightly news maybe even the radio show let's
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:29:03.000]  just give him a radio show just go ahead and get that done and he says it's
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  clearly a hit at least that was what I got from dude who talked to him but go
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:18.760]  ahead oh I had one more question the I think it was 21 26 million bullets that
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:24.600]  Paul Watson had reported that the DHS had purchased yes there's a lot of people
[1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:27.880]  online saying that he read the solicitation wrong and that's actually
[1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:33.680]  like 240,000 bullets okay well okay government's not arm into the teeth

[1:33:08.640 --> 1:33:12.920]  corporations have things called stock puppets they've had them for more than a
[1:33:12.920 --> 1:33:17.800]  decade and it's been admitted the last few years who are computers that go out
[1:33:17.800 --> 1:33:24.720]  and act like people and have preloaded responses to internet memes like why is
[1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:29.560]  the government buying 1.6 billion bullets why are there TSA checkpoints
[1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:34.920]  there's radiation in the scanners the borders are wide open vaccines are
[1:33:34.920 --> 1:33:41.200]  dangerous and they just auto respond you can also go out and you can pay
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:45.960]  companies to go spam for you and they have robots that go out and spam they
[1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:50.440]  call them robots it's a robot program but the general public doesn't even know
[1:33:50.440 --> 1:33:53.880]  about that so that's a conspiracy theory hell the sun coming up in the
[1:33:53.880 --> 1:34:02.080]  morning might be let me explain something it's more like 1.75 billion they
[1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:06.400]  have had hundreds of purchase orders of a hundred thousand two hundred thousand
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:13.000]  a million twenty million a hundred million since November 2011 so do the
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.520]  math that's fifteen sixteen months we've been the leading group following this
[1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:22.520]  they just bought another seven thousand full auto weapons quote for personal
[1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:26.640]  protection last week and twenty one point six more million rounds and what the
[1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:30.480]  media would do last year when it was up to a billion in the middle of last year
[1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:37.800]  is they'd say okay oh infowars.com is saying social security administration
[1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:42.200]  just bought tens of millions of bullets but don't worry the conspiracy
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:48.800]  theorists is wrong they bought it for security you're like well how does that
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:56.080]  make him wrong well it just does it doesn't even make sense so it's about
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:01.760]  one billion seven hundred and fifty million bullets and it's all part of
[1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:06.680]  the drones and the checkpoints and the militarization of police and the armored
[1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:10.280]  vehicles and the tanks and the urban warfare drills and the black
[1:35:10.280 --> 1:35:13.320]  helicopters that you see all over the news and the government admits it's
[1:35:13.320 --> 1:35:17.840]  acclimation to the endopausic commentatus army times civilian and
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:22.880]  mate labor camp programs the 10 FEMA regions the 10 FEMA governors the rural
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:29.440]  affairs council run by Department of Defense Northcom I mean it's all official
[1:35:29.440 --> 1:35:33.720]  that we're just easing into martial law let me punch this up for folks we're
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:43.720]  watching on TV if not just type in Alex Jones DHS okay Alex Jones DHS and hit
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:54.240]  enter and click news search news or search web and you can see right there
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:59.560]  the search that I was doing why is the Department of Homeland Security buying
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:10.280]  so many bullets associated press posted on Fox news comm okay all right and then
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:13.840]  you go down and it says online rumors about big government munitions
[1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:19.160]  purchases are true sort of they never say how it's sort of the Homeland Security
[1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:24.320]  Department wants to buy no no they have bought more than 1.6 billion rounds see
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:28.280]  notice they say more because it's now more than that in the next four to five
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:33.680]  years no they've created the shortage they these are orders for 2011 2012 2013
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:36.960]  they're taking delivery so that's that's the deception right there notice they
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:41.720]  don't link to the Department of Homeland Security purchases they just say
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:45.160]  that it says it needs them roughly the equivalent to five bullets for every
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:48.360]  person in the United States for law enforcement agents in training and on
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:52.400]  duty now the issue is we've done the math it's more than ten times any previous
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:58.560]  year purchase it goes on to say published federal notices about the ammo
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:03.800]  buy have it why not link to those Fox published or CNN or AP for that
[1:37:03.800 --> 1:37:08.600]  matter published federal notices about the ammo buy have agitated conspiracy
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:12.520]  theorists since the fall you mean the Americans paid attention that's when
[1:37:12.520 --> 1:37:17.760]  conservative radio host Alex Jones spoke of an arms race against the American
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:21.960]  people I mean have you looked around folks and said the government was gearing
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:26.360]  up for total collapse I mean they admit they are they're gearing up for huge
[1:37:26.360 --> 1:37:31.680]  wars the government explanation is much less sinister and they just then calmly
[1:37:31.680 --> 1:37:40.880]  say we need the rounds for our agents and then break it down 450 million there
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:46.320]  40 million there you know and it goes to Social Security administration 174
[1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:50.240]  thousand Jones the talk show hosted on a mediate respond to request for a comment
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:53.880]  did not immediately what does that mean you send an email and responded five
[1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:58.720]  seconds to me it's all by the way we did a computer search of AP emails didn't
[1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:03.720]  find one last week we did an email search doesn't mean they didn't send one
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:08.160]  the point is is that it is a travesty so so no let me just tell your friends on
[1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:11.600]  the internet those little sock puppets sometimes their real department of
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:15.080]  defense people that's been admitted okay you're right the government didn't give
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:18.560]  an 85 billion a month to foreign banks to bankrupt the country there's not
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:23.080]  internal checkpoints the TSA is it now running checkpoints up on South Lamar
[1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:27.160]  and awesome even though they are autism hasn't gone from one and 25,000 to one
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:32.520]  and 58 even though it has cancer hasn't gone in the pediatric cancers from one
[1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:38.000]  in several million to now one in a few thousand of course it has actually gas
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.720]  prices haven't gone up because of dollar devaluation of course they have stock
[1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:46.920]  market wise it up because it's less dollars or less our work less it takes
[1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:51.480]  more dollars to buy it but everything's fine you know my crime is I know how the
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:57.400]  world works and you don't know how painful it is how painful it is it's
[1:38:57.400 --> 1:39:02.360]  painful to hear a caller call in and just go there's a lot of people on the
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:09.360]  internet saying you know it you misread those purchase orders and that's how the
[1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:14.040]  media I've seen articles they wrote last year they would say Alex Jones is
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:20.880]  debunked it's not 1.2 billion bullets at that time is how many they bought it's
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:24.680]  it's only a hundred million and then they would show a hundred million
[1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:29.040]  purchase order when our articles showed the scores of purchase orders in the
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:36.800]  year showing it was 1.2 then in 1.6 now 1.75 the ap's too lazy to give you the
[1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:41.560]  number they go more than 1.6 billion because they know it's more than 1.6
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:48.920]  billion I mean is this like planet idiot or something I mean I don't even know
[1:39:48.920 --> 1:39:54.240]  what to do anymore okay there's no bullets the government loves you okay
[1:39:54.240 --> 1:40:00.320]  everything's fine they didn't burn down Dorner you heard CNN last hour I
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:07.080]  supported Dorner I never did but they say I do it must be true there's no
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:10.880]  there's no torture camps there's no secret arrest there's no Patriot Act
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:15.240]  there's no NDAA there's no model states held emergency powers act reports an
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:18.800]  occupation even though there is there's no emergency centers establishment act
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:22.240]  openly admitting all the FEMA camps the Marines aren't training to take your
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:27.120]  guns even though I got them on video everything's fine okay everything's
[1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:33.200]  okay everything's just wonderful can you queue up Obama saying he wouldn't raise
[1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:36.760]  the payroll tax can you queue that up cuz you know what it doesn't matter if
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:41.440]  you're getting you know $25,000 a year $22,000 a year $30,000 a year you're
[1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:46.600]  all getting payroll tax increases it doesn't matter he said they aren't so
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:51.280]  I stand with the government there is not less money coming out of your check I
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:55.760]  heard on the internet there wasn't how's that so what I'm starting to realize
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:40:58.880]  the full mental illness here I could just join people as well let me mentally
[1:40:58.880 --> 1:41:05.600]  ill yeah there's no there's no payroll tax increase on working people who
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:11.920]  both said we have that clip and I can make a firm pledge under my plan no
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:20.240]  family making less than $250,000 a year we'll see any form of tax increase not
[1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:26.120]  your income tax not your payroll tax not your capital gains taxes not any of
[1:41:26.120 --> 1:41:32.640]  your tax rates all of it raised all of it a 3.8 investment tax on the 401k
[1:41:32.640 --> 1:41:38.160]  the the company pulls out of your paycheck the just absolutely huge
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:42.000]  amounts of money making you get government health care and then what is
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:49.560]  it what is it a $5,000 fine per person uninsured in your family that's 20,000
[1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:54.400]  a year on average doubling of premiums this year Supreme Court ruled it was a
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:58.280]  tax of course it's a tax do you want to keep going with all the taxes here the
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:01.720]  carbon taxes via shutting down the power plants I've got articles in the
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:06.240]  stack today giant Texas power plant held up for two years now officially will
[1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:12.720]  never be opened and that's just one of them and I'm not mad at the last caller
[1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:18.640]  it I get so mad at the system and the wall of lies they've put up I did not
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:22.640]  say that the United States launched a meteor or kinetic weapon at Russia we
[1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:26.560]  put out videos and reports saying that it was clearly a stone meteorite and
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:31.600]  associated with a large meteor cluster in which you could even track on NASA's
[1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:40.760]  site or a group of other meteors other smaller asteroids I did not say that I
[1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:47.560]  did not say donor was a good guy but CNN says I do and they'd have bought 1.75
[1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:56.080]  billion bullets in the last 16 months okay okay there are black helicopters
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:42:59.800]  running drills to fire bomb our houses I've talked to the pilots the night
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:05.240]  stalkers out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky they are training to take your guns they
[1:43:05.240 --> 1:43:10.960]  did in Katrina they've introduced bills I counted it up in 15 states to
[1:43:10.960 --> 1:43:15.840]  physically make you turn guns in Missouri, California, Washington State, New
[1:43:15.840 --> 1:43:19.800]  York on and on and on they are coming for our guns but they go we're not coming
[1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:23.080]  for your guns we're not coming for your guns it's a conspiracy theory it's a
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:28.120]  conspiracy theory it's a conspiracy theory I mean folks become an expert on
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:32.040]  politics and things like you are on baseball or football and you'll end up
[1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:39.040]  not being a slave I said I'd take calls and I'm gonna do a complete rant here it
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:51.040]  hurts me what's that John okay oh man it really starting to get to me and and
[1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:56.080]  to sit there and watch all these liars and dissemblers on CNN and MSNBC
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:00.760]  competing with each other in these newspapers and things for who can lie
[1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:07.000]  the most blatantly up there sniveling in their little suits and ties and
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:12.400]  teleprompters and oh man this is crazy let me tell you the most
[1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:17.040]  illusional people are the people lying to folks because most people aren't buying
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:23.280]  it let's go to Larry in Montana Larry you're on the air go ahead hello how are
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:26.840]  you today I'm totally freaking out right now I mean if people don't recognize the
[1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:31.080]  tyranny staring them right in the eyes they're never gonna wake up you did it
[1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:38.040]  with the cigarette you need a cigarette yeah I do you know what what has me
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:42.000]  puzzled is I haven't heard a lot of the story about what happened to the daughter
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:47.280]  of that police officer but no they didn't want to humanize her because this was a
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:50.760]  real event if they would have been parading her around and calling for our
[1:44:50.760 --> 1:44:54.560]  guns to be turned in then you know it would have been look look obviously it
[1:44:54.560 --> 1:45:01.240]  was real because it was such a nightmare for him the thing that is I I don't know
[1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:07.600]  who's who witnessed the daughter but you know they have all these older cops and
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:15.320]  you can tell by the looks on their face and you know it seems the worst they
[1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:20.800]  could pull up you know on him was he looked like a pretty happy guy he just you
[1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:25.280]  know I don't know what you can tell from a photo but you know he wasn't your
[1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:29.760]  average cop and he did come to the defense of whoever was being abused at
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:33.920]  the department one thing for sure we're never gonna hear the truth about what
[1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:38.000]  happened with his daughter other than the police scenario because there's
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:44.200]  nobody that can't nobody to argue the point now I hear you my friend I hear
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:47.240]  you I'm gonna play a club of a California police chief saying guns are not
[1:45:47.240 --> 1:45:51.320]  defensive weapons in a moment which is 180 degrees the opposite of the truth
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:58.960]  guns are used far more often the FBI statistics admit this then they are used
[1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:03.320]  aggressively they're used offensively far more often defensively everybody
[1:46:03.320 --> 1:46:09.480]  knows that but not according to this police chief and it's police chief Ken
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:19.000]  James we have that club here it is one one issue that always boggles my mind
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:26.040]  is that the idea that a gun is a defensive weapon that is a myth a gun is
[1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:30.560]  not a defensive weapon a gun is an offensive weapon used to intimidate and
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:36.680]  you used to show power intimidate you officers do not carry a gun as a
[1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:40.320]  defensive weapon really defend themselves or there are other officers they
[1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:46.760]  carry a gun to be able to do their job in a safe looking like this guy's full
[1:46:46.760 --> 1:46:51.560]  of lonely face any oppositions that we may come upon if it was a defensive
[1:46:51.560 --> 1:46:57.000]  measure why did we lose 55 officers nationwide last year the gun violence
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:02.880]  and unfortunately in just the two months of this year so far we've lost two
[1:47:02.880 --> 1:47:06.760]  officers to gun violence in the state of California and this guy looks like a giant
[1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:11.520]  we deal with gun violence or a round-dog we got Urkel back there behind him
[1:47:11.520 --> 1:47:15.000]  reasonable right man I tell you these police chiefs I didn't know they stacked
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:20.240]  little chicken neck nobody's that high I mean you look at these people I mean
[1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:23.640]  that guy looks like he couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag they're
[1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:29.440]  intimidated see by citizens with guns and he's up there with a bunch of fellow
[1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:32.320]  gun grabbers calling for restrictions on the Second Amendment that's what that
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:37.120]  press commerce was for to blame hey the cops were protecting themselves with
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:45.560]  guns against one of your own people amazing amazing mr. James amazing that
[1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:50.160]  you behave in that fashion and imagine with a straight face guns are not used
[1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:56.840]  offensively and police officers never use guns defensively that's like saying
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:48:02.720]  there is no gravity I am an Easter Bunny turkeys are the pre I mean it's just
[1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:12.000]  like total mindless and Jeberish I mean it's just so pathetic we're ruled by a
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:17.920]  bunch of idiots because we bow to them oh you're wearing a uniform with four
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:30.240]  stars on it here here have my wife here here take my car let's go to another
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:35.280]  phone call thank you Larry thank you Larry imagine having that guy as a
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:40.240]  police chief guns are never used offensively police do not use guns
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:43.760]  defensively really is that why criminals don't like to attack police as they
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:47.640]  know they're armed is that why cops all the time respond to something that's
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:52.840]  happening and defend people what in the world are you talking about you cook you
[1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:58.080]  cook yeah tell that to a woman being gang raped her home good point John let's

[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:56.160]  Congress he'll ban coal power plants on his own without Congress he'll create
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:49:59.120]  carbon taxes without Congress and he'll put our military under foreign
[1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:03.360]  control without Congress and he'll do cybersecurity that admittedly gets rid of

[1:53:58.480 --> 1:54:05.440]  there's a war on for your mind yeah I noticed a few of the comments up on
[1:54:05.440 --> 1:54:09.520]  info wars.com probably following off what I said on air or like what is it a
[1:54:09.520 --> 1:54:14.400]  slow news day you know you're reporting on yourself CNN says Alex Jones
[1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:21.240]  supports Dorner you know media says that Jones says US attacks Russia with
[1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:28.160]  meteor we have to respond to that folks or they'll destroy us if we let them sit
[1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:32.440]  there until ball face lies we get destroyed instead of them getting
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:36.160]  destroyed instead we counter them we have a much bigger audience and then
[1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:40.240]  their audience goes down down down to nothing but you've got to finish
[1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:44.360]  stomping them into the ground with all the rope they give you just because
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:47.400]  somebody has a bunch of rope and a noose around their neck you got to take
[1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:51.080]  them up and you got to pull the lever and so I kicked the lever in their little
[1:54:51.080 --> 1:54:56.760]  neck snap and it's got to be done plus again it's an illustration of how they
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:03.560]  lie remember we have links to this in the article by Paul Joseph Watson it hit
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:06.880]  the zeitgeist last year because the radio shows large but also drudge
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:11.920]  serially that means over and over again linked to our articles off federal
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:16.920]  purchase orders off FA announcements all bibliographed all sourced buying
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:21.880]  hundreds and hundreds of drones doing drone test over farmers surveilling them
[1:55:21.880 --> 1:55:26.120]  and the media came out and said it's not true we're not surveilling and the
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:31.400]  twist was because those are drills see oh well it's a test of surveilling
[1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:34.800]  farmers with drones it's okay no the real surveillance was done with man
[1:55:34.800 --> 1:55:40.160]  Cessnas but we are testing drones for that oh well there's no drone threat well
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:45.760]  now Homeland Security has come back out again and the article is up at info
[1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:48.960]  wars.com prisonbunna.com and also drudgereport.com right in the middle
[1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:55.160]  DHS advances plan for public safety drones more incarnations of spy
[1:55:55.160 --> 1:55:59.960]  technology to undergo testing so when they surveil you it's kind of like us
[1:55:59.960 --> 1:56:05.600]  code title 50 chapter 32 subsection 1,528 paragraph B it says we can't do
[1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:10.880]  any secret testing or lethal testing on the people unless it's for research
[1:56:10.880 --> 1:56:15.000]  purposes or law enforcement purposes oh if it's lethal testing or testing for
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:18.800]  any law enforcement or research then it's okay see it's all these lawyer games
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:23.960]  I videotape drones my cruise videotape from the drones are now above Austin
[1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:28.920]  little ones and big ones the TSA now runs checkpoints two miles from where I
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:33.960]  said told you that was coming ten years ago how did I know they said on C-span
[1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:38.600]  the head of Homeland Security said that was the plan down the road it goes on
[1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:43.520]  here as we first reported in July of last year DHS secretary mr. Napolitano
[1:56:43.520 --> 1:56:46.960]  I meant Janet Napolitano told a house committee on land security that the
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:52.160]  federal agency was looking at drones that could be utilized to give us
[1:56:52.160 --> 1:56:56.880]  situational awareness in large public safety matter or disaster already done
[1:56:56.880 --> 1:56:59.920]  at the Super Bowl despite the fact of the agency had previously indicated it
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:05.200]  was reticent to use spy drones to keep tabs on the public and then it just goes
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:10.320]  through all the news and announcements and Fed biz ops website put out releases
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:15.760]  and DHS 13-01 all the different aircraft all the rest of it the point is
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:22.040]  they already funded it in last year's FAA funding over the next five years 45 46
[1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:26.280]  billion was in the Washington Post I mean but again they reported like it's
[1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:29.240]  good in the Washington Post I take that and say I think it's a bad idea and they
[1:57:29.240 --> 1:57:34.880]  go listen this doesn't exist okay this guy supports Dorner anyways you know and
[1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:39.320]  he says we attack Russia with the with the meteorite pretty crazy huh of course
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:43.560]  I didn't say any of that but they think you're dumb and so that's the tactic as
[1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:47.560]  for the caller who we were just talking to which caller was that or do you hang
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:54.880]  up oh we hung up I said hold on sir I was gonna go back to you yes a lot of
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:57:57.760]  times people think they're being censored just if YouTube isn't working or

[1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:08.200]  getting deleted or suspended or being temporarily what's the term where they
[1:58:08.200 --> 1:58:12.560]  tell you for you can't use your Facebook for a month or whatever for putting out
[1:58:12.560 --> 1:58:17.480]  any pro-second amendment quotes criticizing Obama in any way and it's not a
[1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:24.800]  news issue it's not a news issue that more and more Twitter and Facebook are
[1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:31.760]  being censored or that Facebook just got a giant tax break from Obama you are

[2:00:32.520 --> 2:00:36.800]  of everybody being so dumb that they just can't even navigate all these lies
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:44.840]  unprecedented tyranny is upon us unprecedented lying is upon us we're
[2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:48.440]  in deep trouble and and some people say well that's a negative no the
[2:00:48.440 --> 2:00:51.120]  realization that we're in a lot of trouble is what's going to haul our
[2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:55.760]  bacon okay it's time to get out of the trance it's time to get angry it's time
[2:00:55.760 --> 2:01:02.800]  to get awake cherry in California you're on the air go ahead I'm pretty darn
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:07.280]  bad I mean it freaks me out that seeing in is so evil that they would say that I
[2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:11.120]  supported Chris Dorner when all I've done is criticizing and that and that and
[2:01:11.120 --> 2:01:14.760]  that the Atlantic wire would say that I said that the United States attacked
[2:01:14.760 --> 2:01:19.560]  Russia with a meteorite when I said nothing about that oh yeah hey I was
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:23.760]  calling in so you know how you're saying you you're here and people with
[2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:29.440]  $20,000 getting tax increases well I'm working for a big corporation and we
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:34.000]  got a letter in and I'm only making $12,000 a year and they're telling me my
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:38.320]  taxes are going up this year I just wanted to call you and tell all the
[2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:43.040]  listeners out there that people who are making only $12,000 a year are getting
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:47.440]  tax increases also yeah the way my dad put it and he's in medical management so
[2:01:47.440 --> 2:01:52.440]  he not not just a dentist he manages a bunch of medical stuff and he says my
[2:01:52.440 --> 2:01:57.400]  god it's designed to hurt poor people and he's really upset because I mean it's
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:00.360]  one thing I know the government's crux but I mean to really try to hurt poor
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:05.560]  people while being praised it just makes me want to throw up yeah you know I'm
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:11.200]  I'm in college trying to you know I'm coming from out of state so I have to
[2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:15.200]  pay out of state tuition when the illegal immigrants are actually getting
[2:02:15.200 --> 2:02:19.240]  free college where I'm at and I'm paying out of state tuition no no it's all
[2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:23.360]  designed where in most states the illegals get free tuition are in state
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:27.760]  and then they get to have their kids for free everything paid for it's all
[2:02:27.760 --> 2:02:31.280]  actuaried out where they're just left alone I've had my finger chopped off at
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:35.160]  the hospital and the illegals are just sent right through no insurance so I
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:40.760]  think you have insurance your trash and are back of the line and you know again
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:43.320]  it's nothing against the illegals themselves the globalist one I'm here
[2:02:43.320 --> 2:02:48.680]  to drive down wages and to be a voting block but the way I read it in Forbes and
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:54.920]  AP even admitted it 22 people making $22,000 a year more are seeing payroll
[2:02:54.920 --> 2:03:00.840]  increases and it is just devastating and then under Obamacare most companies
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:04.120]  are laying people off from 40 hours a week where they've got to buy you
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:09.920]  Obamacare to 29 or less where they don't but you're still penalized and have to
[2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:15.640]  buy it and because insurance companies wrote it that's why this year premiums
[2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:21.040]  on average are doubling the average person it's 5,000 a year in premiums
[2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:28.000]  and they estimate now for a family $20,000 a year in insurance now does that
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:34.520]  sound like a good deal for the average person apparently to them oh boy so so
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:38.280]  you make $12,000 a year I think your corporation the company you work for
[2:03:38.280 --> 2:03:42.120]  may have sent that out to everybody you're way below the poverty line bro at
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:47.360]  $12,000 a year you're like working poor you can't even I don't have you live on
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:53.880]  that in California and you should not have a payroll tax increase I know he
[2:03:53.880 --> 2:03:57.840]  said that no one would get increases and I've gone back to that video and I just
[2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:01.080]  I just laugh about it you know it's it's insane I can wait a minute he's a
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:04.760]  Democrat so it must be okay no I know it's just unbelievable and again this is
[2:04:04.760 --> 2:04:09.960]  bipartisan the big insurance companies wrote this Romney got it passed it is a
[2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:15.080]  screw job on the American people and again once corporations can have it the
[2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:18.920]  Supreme Court ruled its attacks paid directly to them now we just got him on
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:23.000]  the line we're going to break and coming back to him Sheriff David Clark of
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:29.400]  Milwaukee County who calmly devastated the lives of Pierce Morgan and the mayor
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:33.520]  of Milwaukee he's coming on for two segments of the bottom of the hour with
[2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:38.640]  us to talk about why he cut that radio ad saying look you need to get guns get
[2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:42.040]  training and protect yourself well I know why he did that but we're gonna ask
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:46.160]  him why and guys get those FBI statistics FBI dot gov ready for me those

[2:08:02.840 --> 2:08:07.200]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:08:08.200 --> 2:08:12.840]  well I've seen a lot of really interesting share of going public for the
[2:08:12.840 --> 2:08:16.840]  second amendment it started in Kentucky spread to Wisconsin Texas
[2:08:16.840 --> 2:08:24.200]  California and now it's over 350 sheriffs as of Stuart Rhodes analysis
[2:08:24.200 --> 2:08:29.400]  with Oath Keepers last night who are elected who I mean I love how the cities
[2:08:29.400 --> 2:08:32.280]  are always trying to get rid of the sheriffs when it's the state and the
[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:36.400]  Constitution that creates the sheriff and under the state law that creates the
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:40.440]  counties and then the municipalities are just sub corporations within it who
[2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:44.720]  have no authority except what they get from the state Constitution so there
[2:08:44.720 --> 2:08:47.040]  they are trying to get rid of the sheriffs that's a whole nother issue and
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:50.920]  of course we've had sheriff Mack on many many times who wanted the Supreme Court
[2:08:50.920 --> 2:08:57.040]  and got so many of the unconstitutional gun laws overturned but I saw Pierce
[2:08:57.040 --> 2:09:02.520]  Morgan interview a few weeks ago I was already trying to get the sheriff on when
[2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:07.440]  he went on Pierce Morgan a sheriff David Clark many of you've heard the ad that he
[2:09:07.440 --> 2:09:11.680]  ran Sam look I need you to be on the team here all over the country they're
[2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:15.360]  having police layoffs sheriff's department layoffs some areas they've laid off
[2:09:15.360 --> 2:09:20.880]  more than half we saw two years ago the police department in Oakland or they
[2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:25.560]  have draconian gun laws said we're not gonna respond to 35 crimes some of them
[2:09:25.560 --> 2:09:30.400]  you know that dealt with armed robbery and stuff really bizarre and then
[2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:33.400]  wonder why their crime only exploded I mean even they're gonna not respond
[2:09:33.400 --> 2:09:39.400]  surely don't announce it so the fact that Sheriff David Clark said look you
[2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:44.200]  need to go out and get firearms but more importantly training everyone needs
[2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:49.040]  training and it's available it's easy do not just go buy a gun folks and then
[2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:53.080]  just think you're protected learn how to use it because I'm all for the Second
[2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:56.600]  Amendment but need to learn how to use it so you don't you know learn what type
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:09:59.440]  of stuff to use in your house but we'll talk about that after he leaves us you
[2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:06.360]  need flangeable stuff sheer safety slugs shotgun shells shooting like number
[2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:09.360]  six number seven so you don't kill people on the other side that's why
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:11.800]  there's some basic training needed here and then once you go out and shoot a
[2:10:11.800 --> 2:10:17.200]  gun it demystifies it go buy a gun then go to a shooting range go pay to have a
[2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:21.920]  trainer train you learn the basics learn the safety and that will promote a
[2:10:21.920 --> 2:10:24.520]  Second Amendment culture of constitutional culture but I was really
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:29.420]  impressed when the sheriff was on Pierce Morgan the lies appears Morgan in the
[2:10:29.420 --> 2:10:35.800]  lies of the mayor and I'll call Tom Barrett a liar saying well the sheriff's
[2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:40.240]  department doesn't respond to crime and I knew all sheriff's departments do I mean
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:43.560]  in many areas there's more to live in the county than the city but I went and
[2:10:43.560 --> 2:10:48.320]  just typed in Milwaukee County hit Google news and saw articles of sheriffs
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:53.600]  responding to home invasions responding to a guy beating his wife and knocking
[2:10:53.600 --> 2:11:00.440]  her teeth out responding to a robbery it was just a feed of articles Milwaukee
[2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:05.240]  sheriff's department responds total lie going you can't talk about needing more
[2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:09.400]  police more sheriffs you don't so we're gonna get into that as well but first if
[2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:13.120]  you just joined us we haven't heard this in a few weeks here is the little
[2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:18.760]  short 30-second radio ad that the sheriff put out saying hey let's let's
[2:11:18.760 --> 2:11:24.120]  kick crime in the butt like Kennesaw Georgia they said you had to own a gun
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:26.640]  by law I don't think that's constitutional but the Swiss do it and
[2:11:26.640 --> 2:11:31.840]  their crime rate dropped by 89% within two years and boy they flipped out
[2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:36.760]  because if this is real common sense let's go to that clip I'm sure if David
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:40.240]  Clark and I want to talk to you about something personal your safety it's no
[2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:44.520]  longer spectator sport I need you in the game but are you ready with officers
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:48.480]  laid off in furloughed simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best
[2:11:48.480 --> 2:11:52.520]  option you can beg for mercy from a violent criminal hide under the bed or
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:56.640]  you can fight back but are you prepared consider taking a certified safety
[2:11:56.640 --> 2:11:59.840]  course and handling of firearms so you can defend yourself until we get there
[2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:03.840]  you have a duty to protect yourself and your family we're partners now can I
[2:12:03.840 --> 2:12:07.040]  count on you this safety message brought you by the Milwaukee County Sheriff's
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:11.000]  Office okay and we're gonna show you some of the graphics if you're watching on
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:14.880]  TV for radio listeners go to FBI.gov people say well if you don't believe the
[2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:18.600]  government why would you use theirs worldwide statisticians use these
[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:22.800]  numbers because they've been getting them since J. Edgar Hoover was a filing
[2:12:22.800 --> 2:12:27.440]  clerk in the 30s their local numbers compiled cross-reference and checked
[2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:35.640]  because it's disseminated just since 2007 it's a 21% drop it is a 49% drop
[2:12:35.640 --> 2:12:43.600]  since 1991 49% drop and we've done countless special reports on that so
[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:48.440]  that's why I guess the sheriff saying by guns protect yourself Sheriff David
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:52.720]  Clark thank you so much for coming on and thank you for being an example of a
[2:12:52.720 --> 2:12:59.480]  real peace officer instead of one of these government you know types that's
[2:12:59.480 --> 2:13:03.320]  there to demonize the Bill of Rights thank you for for defending the
[2:13:03.320 --> 2:13:08.920]  Constitution sir thank you it's a pleasure to be on with you and the pleasure to
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:14.520]  serve you know I'm independently elected as you indicated sheriffs are so we
[2:13:14.520 --> 2:13:19.320]  serve the people you know I don't report to another bureaucrat or other political
[2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:23.520]  official like a police chief you know really works for the mayor I work for
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:27.960]  the people I'm accountable to the people the voters and what I've always done
[2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:31.640]  up in the sheriff's been ten years now is I give people unvarnished
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:36.520]  information I just lay it out for them known sugarcoat to say hey here's the
[2:13:36.520 --> 2:13:41.040]  reality here's what's going on so that people then can take that information
[2:13:41.040 --> 2:13:44.360]  and come to their own conclusions and their own decisions about what they
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:49.240]  should do as it relates to public safety I believe an empowering citizen to make
[2:13:49.240 --> 2:13:53.960]  those decisions I think that an armed citizen is nothing for me to worry about
[2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:59.480]  what I'm worried about if they fell in or another criminal was demonstrated that
[2:13:59.480 --> 2:14:04.240]  they'll use the firearm to commit a crime I'm more worried about individuals
[2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:10.480]  like that let's get into what Pierce Morgan wouldn't let you talk about you
[2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:14.440]  kept trying to say why you had said it's time for people to go get firearms
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:17.840]  training and protect themselves what's going on in Milwaukee County and in the
[2:14:17.840 --> 2:14:25.680]  city itself well a recent increase the surge if you will and it's not just an
[2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:31.360]  anomaly about the street violence where innocent people are getting caught
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:34.880]  across fire they're getting guns stuck to their heads of their wallets taking
[2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:39.280]  their cars taking street robberies and then we've had the homes there's a rash
[2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:47.040]  of burglaries going on in the Milwaukee area 300 a month of August alone and you
[2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:50.080]  know I thought I looked at that then I saw that Mayor Barrett was furloughing
[2:14:50.080 --> 2:14:56.560]  1500 Milwaukee police officers three days each or 2013 I mean 4500 fewer
[2:14:56.560 --> 2:15:01.560]  officers they answered 911 calls for service they they're inundated they're
[2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:06.400]  drowning in 911 calls three cops not that the fault of the cops is not given
[2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:11.800]  the resources and also the county executive Chris Abley laid off 48
[2:15:11.800 --> 2:15:16.960]  sheriff's deputies in my office last year tried to lay off them more before and
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:22.200]  so I look at that you know there's a emerging situation here that people
[2:15:22.200 --> 2:15:26.040]  have always had the right to do and I talk about the add personal security as
[2:15:26.040 --> 2:15:31.240]  an individual responsibility I don't get to say how and when a person should
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:34.920]  defend themselves in these situations and in the case of their home being
[2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:39.840]  broken into and I refer to it as you know when the wolf at the door 911 is not
[2:15:39.840 --> 2:15:43.400]  going to help you the add doesn't say don't don't call 911 you heard it it
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:47.560]  says that that might not be your best option and many of these that I just
[2:15:47.560 --> 2:15:52.760]  described it doesn't now Barrett's enabling and even at Chief Police Chief
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:56.960]  Ed Quinn they basically communicated to the law-abiding people in Milwaukee
[2:15:56.960 --> 2:16:01.960]  County that you're on your own we're not going to provide the resources for the
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:07.600]  police to do everything that they can to create a safe environment citizens
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:11.720]  you're on your own we're abandoning you and I thought well this is a fundamental
[2:16:11.720 --> 2:16:18.200]  a concept as we have in America the concept of self-defense and I thought
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:23.240]  it's two things that went on over the last 18 months in Wisconsin that were
[2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:29.240]  the legislature empowered individuals to deal with these situations not to go
[2:16:29.240 --> 2:16:32.920]  out and police the streets but in terms of personal security one is Castle
[2:16:32.920 --> 2:16:38.040]  Dock where now if the tuner breaks into your home you can use force up to and
[2:16:38.040 --> 2:16:43.080]  including deadly force to ward off that attack to protect you your children
[2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:48.080]  whatever and the onus is on the criminal now to explain why he was in your
[2:16:48.080 --> 2:16:52.840]  house whereas before Castle Dock you had to explain the homeowner had to explain
[2:16:52.840 --> 2:16:56.360]  why it was reasonable to use deadly force the other thing is the personal
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:17:01.240]  protection act which allows people to go out and get a permit and there's a
[2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:07.280]  process and then they can go armed with a concealed weapon I'm trying to leverage
[2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:11.360]  those two things to get people in these that are stuck in these situations and
[2:17:11.360 --> 2:17:15.440]  that's what it is when when somebody comes up the gun into your back or against
[2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:18.760]  your head and demand your wall to your car you're in a situation where 911 is
[2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:23.000]  not going to help I don't tell if you notice I don't tell people what to do I
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:29.040]  say here's the things you need to think about because the time to to plan and to
[2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:34.200]  you know decide what your options are is not when the event is happening it's
[2:17:34.200 --> 2:17:39.320]  beforehand and if that's going to mean that you're going to exercise your
[2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:46.120]  second amendment right to own and possess and use the firearm well you need
[2:17:46.120 --> 2:17:50.560]  to think about you know the training the safety measures I mean any anything
[2:17:50.560 --> 2:17:55.960]  that that that is in the hands of the wrong person is dangerous a chainsaw in
[2:17:55.960 --> 2:18:00.200]  the hands of somebody who's never used one that's dangerous I would expect
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:03.560]  people to read the manual you know so on and so forth and that's what I'm
[2:18:03.560 --> 2:18:12.440]  advising as you know as the company fire well it's common sense what would you
[2:18:12.440 --> 2:18:18.200]  say to the Chicago police chief who's now come out and said just ban the second
[2:18:18.200 --> 2:18:21.680]  amendment it's a problem they've taken the guns there all the criminals then
[2:18:21.680 --> 2:18:25.240]  move there and feed on the people I mean they've got to know that where you take
[2:18:25.240 --> 2:18:28.320]  the guns it has the highest crime rate where you have more guns in the
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:33.440]  citizens hands you have lower crime rate they're not that stupid sheriff Clark so
[2:18:33.440 --> 2:18:38.240]  what's this really all about then well this is really about freedom it's really
[2:18:38.240 --> 2:18:42.880]  about liberty and that's why I mentioned empowering that I trust citizens to make
[2:18:42.880 --> 2:18:47.440]  those decisions in their lives and their personal security and their personal
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:52.280]  safety and apparently the and I didn't hear you know in full context what the
[2:18:52.280 --> 2:18:56.280]  Chicago chief said but you know they're up to their eyeballs and street violence
[2:18:56.280 --> 2:19:01.680]  and they have some of the toughest gun laws known to mankind and I guess that I
[2:19:01.680 --> 2:19:06.440]  would say that that is exhibit a to demonstrate that those things don't work
[2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:13.680]  so what what I'm trying to do here is is give people advice up front to consider
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:17.960]  these things to have a plan in place should that happen to them and they got
[2:19:17.960 --> 2:19:21.960]  it you know it's not for me like I said in the ad you know you can hide under the
[2:19:21.960 --> 2:19:26.360]  bed you can beg for mercy from a violent criminal I'm not saying that you
[2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:29.520]  shouldn't do that maybe that's the best thing in that situation but it's not for
[2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:33.600]  me to say so I want to make sure that the people of Milwaukee County and a
[2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:36.720]  hundred and fifty five thousand people who have applied for the personal
[2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:43.200]  protection permit that was in the first year alone I want them on my side and
[2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:45.840]  we're going to be partners in this thing and if you're going to be partners
[2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:49.320]  with me then you have to be prepared now you know we had an interesting
[2:19:49.320 --> 2:19:55.040]  situation several summers ago where the mayor Tom Barrett without without his
[2:19:55.040 --> 2:20:00.120]  protective bubble you know he gets the taxpayer paid for armed security staff
[2:20:00.120 --> 2:20:03.520]  police officers and he should have that I'm not I don't want to take that away
[2:20:03.520 --> 2:20:07.480]  from him but he lives life in a bubble and he stepped outside that bubble
[2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:10.880]  several summers ago and he was walking down the street with his family and he
[2:20:10.880 --> 2:20:15.840]  intervened in a domestic dispute and a guy who was involved in that dispute
[2:20:15.840 --> 2:20:21.680]  grabbed a tire iron and beat the mayor mercilessly within inches of his life I
[2:20:21.680 --> 2:20:26.280]  mean it was a severe beating and I would like to think you know 9-1-1 didn't
[2:20:26.280 --> 2:20:30.120]  help the mayor that day and he didn't have that protective bubble but if I was
[2:20:30.120 --> 2:20:34.880]  a mayor guaranteed I'd be wearing a gun on my hip in a fanny pack I mean exactly
[2:20:34.880 --> 2:20:37.960]  he's an idiot I mean you're going to try to intervene the most dangerous
[2:20:37.960 --> 2:20:41.800]  situation a domestic event and you're not going to be armed I mean he deserved
[2:20:41.800 --> 2:20:46.960]  it almost well that's how cool it this individual isn't so I would like to
[2:20:46.960 --> 2:20:50.320]  think that he'd be a little more sensitive to the plight of everyday
[2:20:50.320 --> 2:20:55.760]  Americans and citizens living in in the Milwaukee area who have to live with
[2:20:55.760 --> 2:20:59.640]  these threats and this violent on a day-to-day basis and they don't have the
[2:20:59.640 --> 2:21:03.160]  bubble of protection that he has and instead of of him being a little more
[2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:07.360]  sensitive because he now experienced what real life is like like outside that
[2:21:07.360 --> 2:21:14.040]  bubble he still wants to take this availability away from law-abiding
[2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:18.960]  citizens and I just I think it's ridiculous I think it's terrible it is
[2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:24.760]  crazy and again I'm sad he got beaten with an inch of his life but not being
[2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:28.400]  armed and then trying to get involved in something dangerous that's like playing
[2:21:28.400 --> 2:21:33.520]  in traffic and we do see these big urban centers are the only areas where crime
[2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:38.280]  is going up where you don't tend to have people armed just because I guess
[2:21:38.280 --> 2:21:42.800]  culturally across racial lines as well people in big cities for whatever
[2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:46.640]  reason a lot of times don't think they need guns I would I guarantee you if I
[2:21:46.640 --> 2:21:50.520]  lived in a big dangerous city I would have guns even more readily at hand
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:54.960]  living on mm-hmm well as you and as you indicated early on in this
[2:21:54.960 --> 2:22:00.520]  conversation in the Constitution and I tell people the second amendment to me
[2:22:00.520 --> 2:22:04.760]  is the sacred as the first amendment I think they go hand in hand and you know
[2:22:04.760 --> 2:22:07.760]  we've already and I know they're not absolute the second amendment is not
[2:22:07.760 --> 2:22:12.080]  absolute neither is the first but we've shaved enough off the second amendment
[2:22:12.080 --> 2:22:16.840]  with some of these gun control measures many of them that didn't work but we've
[2:22:16.840 --> 2:22:20.880]  shaved enough and the essence of the second amendment it says in part you
[2:22:20.880 --> 2:22:25.160]  know the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be in print I
[2:22:25.160 --> 2:22:29.840]  think we've infringed enough on law-abiding people to be able to keep
[2:22:29.840 --> 2:22:34.480]  and bear arms for whatever reason I realized it has to do with with tyrannical
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:39.200]  government but at the same time the concept of self-defense in this country
[2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:43.480]  in this country the United States of America is very fundamental and I want
[2:22:43.480 --> 2:22:47.800]  to use that I'm not afraid of a law-abiding citizen with a handgun and
[2:22:47.800 --> 2:22:51.720]  you know I'll say it again I'm afraid of a criminal perpetrator because they've
[2:22:51.720 --> 2:22:56.800]  demonstrated well sure in time again they will use that instrumentality to
[2:22:56.800 --> 2:23:00.480]  commit a crime well you what about the mayor's spin that you know criminals
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:04.440]  can get all these handguns he put this 40% number from the statistics I've
[2:23:04.440 --> 2:23:08.280]  seen and what you've tried to talk about that's not a real number it's not a
[2:23:08.280 --> 2:23:11.720]  real number at all he knows that President Obama used the same thing in
[2:23:11.720 --> 2:23:14.800]  his speech on if you notice how they change the language they don't call it
[2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:19.600]  gun control because they know that doesn't pull well and that even people who
[2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:24.480]  don't own guns don't like the thought of banning everybody from from
[2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:31.680]  possessing a firearm but they're using data that's patently fall now Tom
[2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:37.520]  Barrett went on CNN with Pierce Morgan and said 40% of handgun sales in the
[2:23:37.520 --> 2:23:42.600]  United States occur without a background check that is a patent law that is
[2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:48.480]  patently fall he's using some statistics some research that was flawed on its
[2:23:48.480 --> 2:23:54.360]  face from 1997 where 200 people were pulled there's 300 million people in the United
[2:23:54.360 --> 2:24:00.960]  States it's not even a statistically legitimate sample pool to pull 200 p 250
[2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:05.680]  people and come out with something that that would withstand a cluster-minded
[2:24:05.680 --> 2:24:10.800]  you know they always put in the sure but my argument is this criminals are
[2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:14.720]  always going to get guns Mexico has a total has a total gun ban and they have
[2:24:14.720 --> 2:24:19.000]  the highest crime rate in the world next to a city like Chicago it's the highest
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:24.200]  city but as a country Mexico almost 60,000 deaths in fact I think it's over
[2:24:24.200 --> 2:24:27.520]  that now in the last five and a half years and they've taken the guns only
[2:24:27.520 --> 2:24:30.720]  the criminals have the guns and a corrupt government bought off by the
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:34.600]  criminals I mean you know you take the guns in Chicago Al Capone still gonna
[2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:39.680]  have them what about this issue many sheriffs have said Sheriff Clark that if
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:45.440]  executive orders come down banning semi-autos or whatever or this in New
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:48.080]  York they've banned them they've banned the clips they're saying turn them in
[2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:52.600]  they've got bills in Missouri that actually say all semi-autos will be
[2:24:52.600 --> 2:24:56.840]  turned in Democratic Party is crazily behind that Washington state same bill
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:25:03.400]  15 states total seriously if they try to physically take semi-autos I know a lot
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:07.160]  of veterans and people that have had enough and I would not want to be the
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:11.920]  police or sheriff's department ordered by the feds to try to go get guns what
[2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:16.280]  is your take on the fact that from a lot of analysts I talked to think that the
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:21.120]  Obama Marxist types want to start a civil war in this country I mean they've
[2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:24.800]  got to know what's going to happen if they try to confiscate guns well first
[2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:28.880]  of all to me that would be an act here so if the people in Milwaukee County do
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:34.320]  not have to worry about me enforcing some sort of order that goes out and
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:40.640]  collects everybody to handgun it or or rifles or any kind of firearm and makes
[2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:44.320]  them turn them in and the reason is I don't want to get shot because I believe
[2:25:44.320 --> 2:25:50.960]  that if somebody tried to enforce something of that magnitude you would
[2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:55.840]  see the second coming of an American Revolution like youth the likes of
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:26:01.120]  which would would make the first revolution pale by comparison so the
[2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:04.960]  people in Milwaukee County don't have to worry about me engaging in that sort of
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:10.440]  turn you're absolutely right that this country is primed people been abused in
[2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:14.240]  so many ways Obama said their bitter clingers their guns their Bibles we've
[2:26:14.240 --> 2:26:18.360]  been deindustrialized we've had our future sold out we've been signed on to
[2:26:18.360 --> 2:26:22.840]  the bankers debt and I'm telling you certain elements of the feds not the
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:27.360]  average feds I've talked to a lot of them are really pushing and really like
[2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:32.000]  the like the junkyard bully the junkyard dog or the schoolyard bully they
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:35.920]  really want to get this thing going and I don't think they realize the restraint
[2:26:35.920 --> 2:26:39.800]  of the American people is not out of weakness it's it's it's out of good
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:44.560]  old-fashioned restraint well first of all this doesn't have as you know it has
[2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:48.000]  nothing to do with violence reduction because the type of violence that we're
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:52.760]  talking about that I see on the street in a Milwaukee area on a daily basis it's
[2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:57.520]  not even committed using the weapons that the left is trying to ban these are
[2:26:57.520 --> 2:27:04.120]  they're not using assault rifles they're not using high-capacity magazine
[2:27:04.120 --> 2:27:08.160]  they're not buying their ammo over the internet and they don't care the
[2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:13.000]  criminals could care less about a background check so you know that tells
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:18.400]  me that they're disingenuous and in what they're trying to do if
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:23.440]  they were serious about violence reduction they would get behind me I'm
[2:27:23.440 --> 2:27:29.600]  talking about the left here in Milwaukee County and join me arm-in-arm and calling
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:35.040]  for longer periods of incarceration for repeat career criminals who have
[2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:38.640]  demonstrated over and over again that they're gonna get a handgun they're
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:42.280]  going to get a firearm and they're going to perpetrate violence now we had a
[2:27:42.280 --> 2:27:48.560]  temple shooting a thick temple several months ago here very tragic tragic
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:55.080]  situation in a suburb in Milwaukee County both creep that individual Michael
[2:27:55.080 --> 2:27:58.800]  Wade Phillips I believe his name is he passed the background check my
[2:27:58.800 --> 2:28:04.400]  understanding is the the creep in Aurora Colorado that shot up the theater he
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:08.760]  also packed past the background check this isn't about background check of
[2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:14.840]  which the overwhelming majority of gun transfers it goes on anyway Michael Wade
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:21.000]  say that they could make the name up this isn't about reducing violence this is
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:24.480]  about attacking the Second Amendment this is going after the wrong crowd
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:29.000]  exactly ask you this question why does the why does the government class the
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:33.520]  the Socialist class why do they want our guns so bad right now what are they
[2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:41.200]  worried about the future well you know I don't want to get way out there and and
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:44.840]  try to guess to what what they're getting at but really you know government
[2:28:44.840 --> 2:28:50.880]  control cannot go on as long as people have some sort of ability to say hey
[2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:55.440]  wait just the dog gone minute and as long as that exists the government they
[2:28:55.440 --> 2:28:59.040]  that's what the government they don't really fear the criminal they support
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:03.280]  the criminal after they've been arrested but what they fear is a law
[2:29:03.280 --> 2:29:06.760]  biting person that's right who's gonna look I mean read the declaration of
[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:10.600]  independent it's right there where a law-abiding people say enough is enough

[2:34:55.720 --> 2:34:59.440]  about tyranny and government but a big part of it is Thomas Everson said the
[2:34:59.440 --> 2:35:06.880]  presence of firearms restrains evil everywhere they're present and guns
[2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:10.120]  there's gonna be some bad things that happen bad people are gonna use them
[2:35:10.120 --> 2:35:13.840]  it's an inanimate object and I know you know that I know that we better get the
[2:35:13.840 --> 2:35:17.520]  word out to everybody about that now listen here's an example of what I'm
[2:35:17.520 --> 2:35:22.560]  talking about top at prisonplana.com infowars.com and I founded a
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:27.520]  drudgereport.com let's let's punch up drudge for TV viewers misstep in gun
[2:35:27.520 --> 2:35:32.920]  bill could defeat the effort see they'll always go for what they can get
[2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:37.160]  they've banned a bunch of guns and banned their sale and banned high-capacity
[2:35:37.160 --> 2:35:43.440]  magazines in New York that they've got bills introduced in Seattle to physically
[2:35:43.440 --> 2:35:48.520]  ban guns for Washington State other states and it says one of the major gun
[2:35:48.520 --> 2:35:52.720]  control efforts in Olympia this session calls for the sheriff to inspect the
[2:35:52.720 --> 2:35:55.760]  homes of assault weapons owners that's all semi-honored to get you ready for
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:35:59.440]  confiscation the image of cops coming in your house the bill's backers say that
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:03.520]  was a mistake see oh we went for too much
[2:36:03.880 --> 2:36:07.640]  well I mean you got another bill that makes you turn them in I mean I covered
[2:36:07.640 --> 2:36:12.360]  this Sunday and read I mean the Missouri bill says you actually turn them in so
[2:36:12.360 --> 2:36:19.920]  to a bunch of other states so it's on ladies and gentlemen it's on and of
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:24.240]  course they even spend this it is an inspection to make sure there aren't any
[2:36:24.240 --> 2:36:28.800]  semi-autos in there so see even this article is a whitewash they're coming
[2:36:28.800 --> 2:36:36.240]  for the guns they're coming for the guns they don't want the gravy train to end
[2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:40.840]  forget police drones flying over your house how about police coming inside
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:47.360]  once a year have a look around yeah move to Massachusetts 30 do that it's all
[2:36:47.360 --> 2:36:52.040]  part of a major gun control effort it seems in recent weeks lawmakers might
[2:36:52.040 --> 2:36:56.000]  be headed towards some common sense regulation of guns see but then last
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:00.480]  week they went too far by mistake they claim but still too far and then it said
[2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:03.560]  it got everybody angry so all the bills will be killed yeah because you're so
[2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:08.560]  greedy do we have the Feinstein clip you're so greedy you've admitted you
[2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:14.560]  want to take all our guns okay you've admitted you want to take all of our
[2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:22.920]  guns and now people are waking up to that let's go ahead and go to the Feinstein
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:27.520]  clip if she said if she could get it Mr. and Mrs. America turn in all the
[2:37:27.520 --> 2:37:31.720]  semi-autos and then like Australia or England or everywhere else they'll take
[2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:36.120]  them all here it is California Senator Diane Feinstein worked for more than a
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:39.840]  year to get the assault weapons bill passed in the face of ferocious
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:43.920]  opposition from the National Rifle Association she says she got the best
[2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:50.040]  she could if I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States
[2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:57.280]  for an outright ban picking up every one of them Mr. and Mrs. America turn them
[2:37:57.280 --> 2:38:02.960]  all in I would have done it by the way not do that the votes weren't there you
[2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:07.760]  know the minute they get the votes they take the guns Chicago New York everywhere
[2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:12.560]  else they're in control but they've got bodyguard details paid for by you they're
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:18.920]  never going to stop because they're not liberals these are authoritarian lying
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:25.240]  monsters and pray for this broadcast right now ladies and gentlemen because
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:30.080]  again on a Richter scale used to be about a two now it's about a nine the
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:34.680]  corporate globalist media lying about us I mean they're bold now I mean the word
[2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:39.400]  is out to you know defeat Alex Jones discredit Alex Jones bring down Alex
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:44.160]  Jones I mean they got me they're saying Alex likes the cop killer he supports
[2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:50.160]  them seeing in Alex says the America attack Russia with the meteorite Alex
[2:38:50.160 --> 2:38:55.600]  is lying about the bullets Alex is a racist Alex wants to kill cops Alex
[2:38:55.600 --> 2:38:58.960]  wants to blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:09.400]  almost like Cal Dracula blah blah blah blah blah come and be a vampire suck our blood
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:15.160]  raise our taxes here that guy earlier he makes $12,000 a year and his employer
[2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:18.160]  said they got to take more out for withholding now I got a check on that I
[2:39:18.160 --> 2:39:22.560]  thought it was I read one article saying $30,000 a year that I thought another I
[2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:29.040]  went and read the law it's very hard to understand people I've confirmed on a 22
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:33.720]  thousand dollars a year people are having money taken out I've confirmed
[2:39:33.720 --> 2:39:40.540]  with my crew running a wide-pace scale they're all getting payroll tax
[2:39:40.540 --> 2:39:47.200]  increases and none of them make a quarter million dollars a year we got
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:51.480]  people in the shipping department making $30,000 a year I think a little bit
[2:39:51.480 --> 2:39:55.640]  more than that would pay people pretty good for shipping they've got money
[2:39:55.640 --> 2:40:00.200]  coming out I mean we sit there and look at it got folks paid you know double that
[2:40:00.200 --> 2:40:06.200]  bunch of money coming out people paid more than that and money's being taken
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:12.320]  out so but that's a conspiracy theorist if you ever criticize government it
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:17.520]  doesn't exist okay I mean if I again the government does nothing but make
[2:40:17.520 --> 2:40:22.560]  everything happy in the birds tweet by the way I've done two hours and 40

[2:45:54.400 --> 2:46:00.440]  Arthur in Oregon thank you for putting up with me you're on the air. Hello Alex.
[2:46:00.440 --> 2:46:05.480]  Hey buddy. I think that you're totally right that we are the masters and that
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:10.400]  these that you lead is our servants are like this skinny dog and what people
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:14.640]  need to do is just realize that that's the truth and then draw the power from
[2:46:14.640 --> 2:46:19.480]  that realize that we already are the masters and we already are empowered.
[2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:25.720]  Yeah everything government does is about pecking us in pecking us into
[2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:29.800]  submission and and teaching us how we're bad and they're good and that is the
[2:46:29.800 --> 2:46:34.440]  opposite of what this country was founded on and and so great if people want
[2:46:34.440 --> 2:46:38.280]  bondage and they like Obama lying to them and raising their taxes on poor
[2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:42.720]  people and and the big banks that own the insurance companies absolutely folks
[2:46:42.720 --> 2:46:48.000]  I can't believe how bad Obamacare was I mean I read the bills I had experts on
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:53.680]  I knew how bad it was but now it's worse than I thought I mean it's so horrible
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:46:58.240]  and it's meant to bankrupt the country and it's just so evil and then I read
[2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:01.440]  you know the owner of Paul Mitchell who's a nice guy I know people that know
[2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:07.680]  him he lives here in Austin you know saying things like oh Obama you know he
[2:47:07.680 --> 2:47:11.920]  he just doesn't understand raising taxes hurts poor people I hope he wakes up
[2:47:11.920 --> 2:47:16.120]  wakes up they want us under their control we're being conquered this is
[2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:23.360]  economic scorched earth absolutely right and I think that leaving a healthy
[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:28.160]  lifestyle is going to allow people to just wake up and realize that we can do
[2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:32.640]  this and that no one has a solution but we all have a resolution and that's just
[2:47:32.640 --> 2:47:36.320]  to be able to live peacefully and and they're absolutely trying to use
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:41.320]  syrup and stop us absolutely brother god bless you I appreciate your call what
[2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:45.680]  you think about sheriff you still there yeah um that was righteous that was
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:49.080]  really good stuff I think but the thing is when you talk to good sheriffs or
[2:47:49.080 --> 2:47:54.160]  police they're well spoken they're focused they just look different a
[2:47:54.160 --> 2:47:58.560]  patriot looks different than one of these anti gunners these anti gunners all
[2:47:58.560 --> 2:48:02.840]  look like chicken-neck criminals they look like bad guys out of a movie like
[2:48:02.840 --> 2:48:07.160]  warmer grime wood out of Lord of the Rings or something I mean they just they
[2:48:07.160 --> 2:48:10.840]  look like textbook scumbags speaking of that here I'm having my Beyond Tangy

[2:48:33.480 --> 2:48:38.080]  exploded from the two to the nine like you were saying I think it's awful boy
[2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:41.560]  they're treating you in the media man you deserve so much but this is great
[2:48:41.560 --> 2:48:46.000]  news listen listen they're doing it because we're hurting them
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:51.280]  exactly yes I don't I mean I'm not whining about this because oh they're
[2:48:51.280 --> 2:48:56.200]  attacking me I'm doing it to discredit them because if I just take it then they
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:49:00.520]  win this is great listen what do they say in World War two when you got over
[2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:04.400]  the actual target they would have all these smokers miles away with the
[2:49:04.400 --> 2:49:08.160]  prevailing winds you couldn't see the bomb targets that's where they had you
[2:49:08.160 --> 2:49:13.000]  know GPS or ground penetrating or you know radar to see the targets they would
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:17.160]  know where the targets were by flying into the flat cloud so when you're
[2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:21.480]  over the flack man that means you're over the target brother and but they're
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:25.320]  still not hitting you they're missing like you said I don't know they've hit
[2:49:25.320 --> 2:49:30.440]  me quite a few times but I don't care but go ahead well I found that you know
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:36.080]  the lies are automated arm of their rhetorical engine you know this is a
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:39.760]  newly accepted thing I think in mass media people you know they fall into
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:43.920]  this binary between fantasy and reality that just endless and and it doesn't
[2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:48.640]  matter no that's it the system has blurred reality with fiction and for the
[2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:53.720]  crowd that said a trance CNN lies work I mean if they say I support Dorner
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:49:57.720]  doesn't matter if I was against him from day one they don't show any proof it
[2:49:57.720 --> 2:50:02.320]  must be true and then they giggle as friends of CNN they don't have real
[2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:07.200]  friends they just sit in their house watching CNN and and it reaffirms
[2:50:07.200 --> 2:50:12.720]  their delusion like I don't expect anything more from literal demons and
[2:50:12.720 --> 2:50:15.480]  that is why I've sworn off mainstream media I didn't even know they were

[2:54:12.640 --> 2:54:17.440]  closest asteroid ever to cross by the earth since they've been recording that
[2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:22.160]  last six years so years did not leave without a bang there were quite a few
[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:26.040]  big meteor showers all over the world seen from Australia to Florida from
[2:54:26.040 --> 2:54:31.200]  Cuba to California and there's still more meteors fireballs light up Florida
[2:54:31.200 --> 2:54:38.800]  sky that came out this morning NBC News and as I said normally an asteroid
[2:54:38.800 --> 2:54:42.080]  like that comes around one times it has stragglers with it because when it's
[2:54:42.080 --> 2:54:46.880]  kicked out of the Kuiper belt outside the edge of the solar system or closer in
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:50.800]  the asteroid belt whatever comment or whatever comes by and knocks them out of
[2:54:50.800 --> 2:54:55.360]  the regular orbit generally knocks some other stuff with them and so that's why
[2:54:55.360 --> 2:54:59.160]  you've seen the big stone meteors coming in of course it doesn't matter what I
[2:54:59.160 --> 2:55:03.400]  just said CNN and Atlantic wire will just say that I said aliens did it or
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:09.840]  something but there you go yeah there's some footage of one of the giant burning
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:16.880]  craters man that looks like something out of a movie whoa man is that not awesome
[2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:23.160]  looking oh my gosh look at that video of that crater I hadn't seen that one yet
[2:55:23.160 --> 2:55:31.800]  is that out of Russia wow unbelievable and that thing blew up that was just one
[2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:37.600]  piece of it did that wow wow no wonder that injured over a thousand people
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:41.800]  like they said like 1200 now it's like something of a science fiction movie man
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:48.760]  whoa I had all this other news we got to a lot of it I'm gonna shoot some special
[2:55:48.760 --> 2:55:53.680]  reports that are gonna be on the nightly news tonight on the financial end of it
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:56.880]  there's a global currency war going on the G20s meeting to act like they're
[2:55:56.880 --> 2:56:00.640]  trying to fix it the war is everybody lowering their currency which means
[2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:06.280]  devaluing it and and you know that's why gas prices are exploding that's the
[2:56:06.280 --> 2:56:11.200]  biggest contributive cause that's why real estate prices have gone back up and
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:17.560]  now they're calling it another bubble with more subprime stuff and it's a
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:21.840]  fake economy and even Alan Greenspan you know is on the news saying oh we're
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:26.840]  going over the edge of the cliff Friday when the globalists engineered all this
[2:56:26.840 --> 2:56:33.160]  globalism is death to an economy it's poison and it's time to be honest honest
[2:56:33.160 --> 2:56:36.820]  about this post-industrial world that we're going into it is some overdrive
[2:56:36.820 --> 2:56:41.600]  here in a moment JD in California local sheriff refuses to respond to what you
[2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:46.800]  say well what happened to you yeah I was trying to get to take up near all
[2:56:46.800 --> 2:56:50.320]  these sheriffs you know coming out making public statements about where they
[2:56:50.320 --> 2:56:54.360]  stand and all on the second amendment and so I've been trying to contact my
[2:56:54.360 --> 2:56:58.280]  local sheriff and over and over again I've been you know sending them emails and
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:03.000]  handwritten letters and they refuse to comment on it so I don't know if that's
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:06.960]  a good thing or bad thing well least you tried over 300 sheriffs now say they
[2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:11.720]  won't be part of a gun confiscation I mean already 800 plus cities don't
[2:57:11.720 --> 2:57:16.240]  arrest illegal aliens which is constitutional to do so why couldn't
[2:57:16.240 --> 2:57:19.920]  they ignore something that that is constitutional I mean yeah absolutely I
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:23.240]  mean you know I mean that's why it makes me mad I get pulled over sometimes and
[2:57:23.240 --> 2:57:27.160]  the cop knows who I am and ask about guns it's just like it's Texas you know I
[2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:30.040]  don't have a criminal record you just pulled me over don't ask about my guns
[2:57:30.040 --> 2:57:34.880]  buddy and they're not all like that but I get really angry now stop acting like

[2:58:01.640 --> 2:58:07.400]  they got and he said that Obama refused to look any of them in the eyes that he
[2:58:07.400 --> 2:58:11.040]  would look him in the shoulder like would refuse to make eye contact with
[2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:16.720]  them like he's like they were beneath him and that he had a dead fish handshake
