[01:19.560 --> 01:25.800]  fix for narrowing trade gap because we're so deindustrialized you would think
[01:25.800 --> 01:29.600]  that a weak dollar though it's bad for almost everything the economy that it
[01:29.600 --> 01:34.720]  might be good a little bit to increase the manufacturing but there's no real
[01:34.720 --> 01:40.320]  industry left here to speak of that can compete with China India Mexico because
[01:40.320 --> 01:45.720]  they have such low standards and environmental workers comp greenhouse
[01:45.720 --> 01:50.520]  gas taxes you name it that no one can compete it is the race to the bottom
[01:50.520 --> 01:54.640]  that's the globalist model in their own documents their own statements it's
[01:54.640 --> 01:59.560]  meant to deindustrialize the West so that we become completely bankrupt to the
[01:59.560 --> 02:05.200]  central banks we're gonna be breaking that down also million people hit by
[02:05.200 --> 02:11.440]  plague worse than swine flu well the swine flu is not a very bad plague but
[02:11.440 --> 02:18.720]  it certainly is a huge hype machine a psychological plague but it is killing a
[02:18.720 --> 02:23.840]  lot of people reportedly in the Ukraine and Poland and now top scientists in
[02:23.840 --> 02:30.280]  Ukraine are saying they believe the h1n1 virus and the regular seasonal flu
[02:30.280 --> 02:36.280]  virus somehow mutated or that the Tama flu and the flu vaccines did this this

[03:01.960 --> 03:08.200]  being given the shot there's a whole bunch of headlines covering that so we're
[03:08.200 --> 03:13.360]  gonna be going over the latest developments with the swine flu slash
[03:13.360 --> 03:21.200]  flu hype now some type of unnamed super virus in Eastern Europe and then I'm
[03:21.200 --> 03:29.240]  also going to play several clips from Fox News today both of them of Chuck
[03:29.240 --> 03:35.080]  Norris Chuck Norris goes on Cavuto and says world
[03:35.080 --> 03:41.800]  government's being set up through the carbon tax and then national media makes
[03:41.800 --> 03:49.800]  fun of him and calls him a kook when ban chi moon two Sundays ago wrote an
[03:49.800 --> 03:54.120]  editorial for the New York Times sees the Secretary General of the UN calling
[03:54.120 --> 03:57.360]  for global government and saying the carbon tax would fund global government
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.280]  so Chuck Norris isn't allowed to read the New York Times that's pro-world
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.280]  government and say I don't want world government and Chuck Norris isn't allowed
[04:06.280 --> 04:11.120]  to do this with Sean Hannity he was on with Sean Hannity later that same day
[04:11.120 --> 04:19.440]  last week Cavuto didn't make fun of him Sean Hannity did and said Ron Paul was
[04:19.440 --> 04:25.760]  crazy so so Ron Paul was crazy 10 years ago saying overspending with the value
[04:25.760 --> 04:29.760]  of the dollar now happening Ron Paul was crazy saying it would destroy our
[04:29.760 --> 04:34.040]  industry now happening Ron Paul was crazy saying we have 20% unemployment now
[04:34.040 --> 04:39.800]  happening Ron Paul was crazy talking about global government now I guess I
[04:39.800 --> 04:45.120]  was crazy see Sean Hannity is a plant ladies and gentlemen he's there to pose
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.400]  as if he's a patriotic conservative while trying to discredit those of us that
[04:49.400 --> 04:53.480]  are really trying to save this country and I'm sick of it I'm sick of him
[04:53.480 --> 04:58.120]  attacking people and talking down to Chuck Norris and talking down to Ron

[06:01.280 --> 06:06.320]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[06:06.320 --> 06:20.240]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the time
[06:20.240 --> 06:28.920]  for denial is over unelected tyrannical world government is being openly
[06:28.920 --> 06:33.680]  announced by every major news publication in the world and most of these
[06:33.680 --> 06:38.200]  publications are spinning it saying that world government is an answer to all
[06:38.200 --> 06:42.400]  of our problems it's an answer to the banks that have devalued the currency
[06:42.400 --> 06:47.160]  and stolen tens of trillions though the big banks are openly saying they will
[06:47.160 --> 06:50.840]  run the world government and they're the ones pushing it world government will
[06:50.840 --> 06:54.840]  save us from war though the very same interest pushing the global government
[06:54.840 --> 06:59.640]  are the ones starting all the major wars and funding both sides they're saying
[06:59.640 --> 07:04.920]  world government is the answer to the the evils of national sovereignty and
[07:04.920 --> 07:10.440]  that more globalism more deindustrialization more driving down
[07:10.440 --> 07:18.240]  the wages is the answer now this is a psychological form of mind control
[07:18.240 --> 07:23.280]  we've been put under where for decades as the world government was being set up
[07:23.280 --> 07:30.200]  and as it was being developed and foisted on the people and as people like
[07:30.200 --> 07:36.400]  myself and congressman Ron Paul and many others were reading official UN
[07:36.400 --> 07:40.600]  documents official club of Rome documents official trilateral Commission CFR
[07:40.600 --> 07:46.560]  Bilderberg group ran corporation Pentagon I mean the elite for decades have been
[07:46.560 --> 07:50.760]  very public about what they're setting up they just never set it on the news and
[07:50.760 --> 07:57.200]  so you'd say hey I have foreign affairs April issue 1998 saying the banks are
[07:57.200 --> 08:02.560]  gonna get everybody in debt implode the currency and bring in world government
[08:02.560 --> 08:07.440]  and they'd say oh there's no such thing look at the crazy Alex Jones look at the
[08:07.440 --> 08:11.720]  crazy Ron Paul look at these crazy people that don't I mean when Margaret
[08:11.720 --> 08:16.280]  Thatcher after she left office came out and criticized it they said look at the
[08:16.280 --> 08:21.840]  crazy Margaret Thatcher back then you weren't supposed to talk about this
[08:21.840 --> 08:26.960]  because they hadn't completed the construction of the world government yet
[08:26.960 --> 08:31.320]  now the world government is nearing completion they can't deny it anymore
[08:31.320 --> 08:37.200]  and so they're unveiling it but saying you're a kook you're bad you're evil if
[08:37.200 --> 08:42.880]  you don't want to go along with it and so today I wanted to play a few Chuck
[08:42.880 --> 08:48.280]  Norris clips coming up in the next segment because Chuck Norris is a
[08:48.280 --> 08:51.040]  listener of this show and I've talked to him on and off air this is one of the
[08:51.040 --> 08:54.880]  main shows that really woke him up in the last five years from being a main
[08:54.880 --> 09:00.520]  line Republican to figuring out both parties are controlled but still he's
[09:00.520 --> 09:03.880]  falling into the orbit of Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck who are controlled
[09:03.880 --> 09:09.600]  opposition and at key points Glenn Beck comes out and attacks Ron Paul and attacks
[09:09.600 --> 09:13.400]  people that believe in global government and attacks people that report on
[09:13.400 --> 09:19.840]  FEMA camps but when Chuck Norris was on Cavuto he didn't get made fun of for
[09:19.840 --> 09:24.920]  talking about this but when he was on Hannity he did and he started saying I
[09:24.920 --> 09:30.120]  like Ron Paul and Sean Hannity said well Ron Paul's crazy and the Chuck Norris
[09:30.120 --> 09:34.440]  said well that's why I like him I'm crazy too and laughed at Hannity but the
[09:34.440 --> 09:40.080]  issue here is Hannity isn't stupid Hannity knows Sean Hannity knows there's a
[09:40.080 --> 09:43.320]  world government he's not stupid he's been sent all the information for over a
[09:43.320 --> 09:50.360]  decade it's his job to keep Republicans on the main line fake blue dog
[09:50.360 --> 09:57.440]  Republican blue blood Republican bandwagon where George Bush triples the
[09:57.440 --> 10:01.320]  size of government and we still call that conservative or George Bush signs
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.880]  the Patriot Act violating our bill of rights and we call that conservative
[10:05.880 --> 10:10.840]  basically you hate the Democrats who are pushing big government and socialism
[10:10.840 --> 10:15.840]  but you never hate the Republicans that are doing the same thing but I've got
[10:15.840 --> 10:20.640]  news for Sean Hannity and people the American people whether they consider
[10:20.640 --> 10:24.480]  themselves liberals or conservatives are shattering the left-right paradigm they
[10:24.480 --> 10:32.800]  are waking up in a big big way and they are reading the government documents
[10:32.800 --> 10:37.280]  they are reading the legislation they are reading Ban Ki-moon the secretary
[10:37.280 --> 10:42.160]  general the UN two Sundays ago who wrote the editorial titled we can do it
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.000]  calling for world government and admitting the carbon tax has meant to
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.280]  fund the world government the American people are reading the UN treaty that
[10:52.280 --> 10:57.960]  Reuters reported on last Thursday that Obama is now saying he's going to sign
[10:57.960 --> 11:04.120]  and try to get ratified which says all small arms are to be banned under this
[11:04.120 --> 11:09.560]  UN treaty you can't own firearms we're gonna go over that today the American
[11:09.560 --> 11:14.520]  people have figured out that Republicans come and Democrats come and go but
[11:14.520 --> 11:19.760]  that the true power structure the military industrial complex itself owned
[11:19.760 --> 11:24.920]  by large central banks remains in control and making fun of people who know
[11:24.920 --> 11:28.640]  how to read editorials written by the UN secretary general in the New York
[11:28.640 --> 11:36.360]  Times doesn't work anymore how can Sean Hannity on the fake right and on the
[11:36.360 --> 11:42.000]  fake left George Soros and all his publications make fun of anyone that
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.440]  says there's a world government while George Soros himself calls for a
[11:47.440 --> 11:54.040]  global government that's now being set up how can Rupert Murdoch go to the
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.320]  Davos Switzerland economic forum every year and call for global government and
[11:58.320 --> 12:04.760]  then Sean Hannity set up there and say there's no such thing no Ron Paul and
[12:04.760 --> 12:10.120]  Alex Jones and other people of our ilk have not been crazy we've been well read
[12:10.120 --> 12:16.440]  and well researched and we've been raising the alarm and so when fake
[12:16.440 --> 12:20.840]  conservatives when Benedict Arnold's like Sean Hannity who were meant to keep
[12:20.840 --> 12:23.880]  Republicans in the dark and conservatives and libertarians and
[12:23.880 --> 12:28.320]  well-meaning liberals in the dark when he gets up and says Ron Paul's crazy
[12:28.320 --> 12:32.440]  really Ron Paul talked about devaluation of the dollar two years ago
[12:32.440 --> 12:40.840]  during the Republican primaries it was Ron Paul who talked about how they were
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.120]  planning to expand these wars and how we were losing our jobs and it was Ron
[12:45.120 --> 12:49.520]  Paul that talked about double-digit unemployment and inflation coming it was
[12:49.520 --> 12:53.560]  Ron Paul that talked about how gold was going to go above a thousand dollars and
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.920]  ounce two years ago in the next two years it's Ron Paul who wins economic
[12:57.920 --> 13:03.280]  awards from prestigious universities he's given doctorates by universities
[13:03.280 --> 13:07.960]  that teach economics it's Ron Paul who's been right about everything because he
[13:07.960 --> 13:11.560]  understands the globalist agenda I've been right about everything we've talked
[13:11.560 --> 13:15.920]  about because I'm only reading their own white papers and what the elites are
[13:15.920 --> 13:22.560]  planning for this country and for this society that's all I'm doing that's all
[13:22.560 --> 13:28.120]  Ron Paul is doing and you can't have it both ways you can't set up here it's like
[13:28.120 --> 13:32.080]  I said last week the national media can't sit here and say there's no
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.400]  mercury in the vaccines and say we're liars when every vaccine insert says it
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.960]  has mercury in it all the major vaccines including h1n1 and regular
[13:40.960 --> 13:45.640]  seasonal but not just flu vaccines you can't sit up here and say it can't cause
[13:45.640 --> 13:50.280]  Gillian or Guillain beret and it can't cause other neurological disorders and
[13:50.280 --> 13:55.720]  autoimmune disorders and death when it's all over the news that people are
[13:55.720 --> 14:00.440]  dying and being killed and being maimed all over the world and the US from the
[14:00.440 --> 14:07.760]  vaccines and when the establishment media tries to lie and say that anyone
[14:07.760 --> 14:11.760]  that questions the establishment is a kook or a nut or a lunatic it doesn't
[14:11.760 --> 14:17.760]  work anymore it only discredits you the person that's lying there is a global
[14:17.760 --> 14:22.560]  government openly being announced by the United Nations our central government
[14:22.560 --> 14:26.160]  under Bush and now Obama has been greasing the skids to bring us into
[14:26.160 --> 14:30.680]  this into a new system where our bill of rights our Constitution is not honored
[14:30.680 --> 14:35.320]  where our liberty and our freedom is trashed we're unelected offshore
[14:35.320 --> 14:42.080]  corporations control the new private global government and the establishment
[14:42.080 --> 14:47.040]  is setting this up right now hoping by still engaging in denial with one hand
[14:47.040 --> 14:49.600]  out of one side of their mouth and out of the other side of their mouth
[14:49.600 --> 14:55.200]  admitting it's real but saying oh it's good that isn't gonna fly they could do
[14:55.200 --> 14:59.360]  that 10 years ago because we weren't this far along in the program in the
[14:59.360 --> 15:03.560]  process of globalization and because most people weren't getting their news on
[15:03.560 --> 15:09.800]  the internet you can't have the New York Times calling for global government
[15:09.800 --> 15:13.800]  with an article written by the secretary general of the UN saying the carbon
[15:13.800 --> 15:19.200]  tax will fund the world government and then have Sean Hannity get up on TV and
[15:19.200 --> 15:28.880]  say none of it exist you cannot do that and liars like Sean Hannity need to be
[15:28.880 --> 15:33.360]  held responsible all these big fake conservative talk show hosts that are
[15:33.360 --> 15:38.040]  still telling you there's no world government and there's no IMF and no
[15:38.040 --> 15:42.840]  World Bank system taking over anyone that sits there and defends Wall Street
[15:42.840 --> 15:46.440]  that engineered the housing collapse even McClatchy newspapers are reporting
[15:46.440 --> 15:51.200]  on that off of secret documents anyone that tries to aid these criminal banks
[15:51.200 --> 15:56.120]  in their takeover is an enemy of the Republic Obama's an enemy of the Republic
[15:56.120 --> 16:01.000]  and Sean Hannity's an enemy of the Republic they're all working together the
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.640]  illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want

[24:39.960 --> 24:43.480]  card you swipe whenever you buy something or sell something tracking
[24:43.480 --> 24:47.080]  everything you do and when you run out of your carbon credits you get taxed

[24:51.680 --> 24:55.680]  use them sure if the government wasn't corrupt this wouldn't be a problem but
[24:55.680 --> 25:01.240]  we've always pointed out that this is a problem because they can use it to

[26:08.120 --> 26:12.400]  the Woody Harrelson character is basically an Alex Jones ascribing and
[26:12.400 --> 26:18.520]  attributing all these things he says in the film that I don't believe to me that
[26:18.520 --> 26:24.240]  way when 2012 comes and nothing bad happens people are gonna say Alex Jones

[33:31.280 --> 33:36.280]  plans to bring the polluter pays principal into the home garage drivers
[33:36.280 --> 33:40.800]  will soon pay a few cents for every kilometer or mile on the road in a plan
[33:40.800 --> 33:45.040]  aimed at breaking chronic traffic jams and cutting carbon emissions the
[33:45.040 --> 33:50.520]  cabinet decided Friday now we have Oregon California Washington State and Texas
[33:50.520 --> 33:55.400]  looking at adding this on top of your gas tax this is only one of hundreds of
[33:55.400 --> 34:00.920]  taxes you'll pay under the UN cap-and-trade tax that they're trying to
[34:00.920 --> 34:08.680]  fully pass under the Copenhagen Denmark treaty that is coming up but going back
[34:08.680 --> 34:13.960]  to Anita in Texas Anita I I'm not going to give you medical advice I'm not a
[34:13.960 --> 34:19.040]  doctor but we did have Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny medical doctor on the show
[34:19.040 --> 34:24.080]  Thursday in studio and I said hey I give my children the vitamin K when they were
[34:24.080 --> 34:28.120]  born at the hospital I allowed that none of the vaccines and she said no that's
[34:28.120 --> 34:33.880]  even bad for babies because of some of the circumcisions they do sometimes
[34:33.880 --> 34:38.720]  babies haven't developed blood platelets and they can bleed but she said
[34:38.720 --> 34:42.520]  that's why they give the vitamin K but they said it's seven days the babies
[34:42.520 --> 34:46.600]  start producing the chemicals they need in their bloodstream to thicken their
[34:46.600 --> 34:50.680]  blood and she said there's a lot of health complications associated with it
[34:50.680 --> 34:55.480]  but nothing compared to the hepatitis shot and others they try to give newborn
[34:55.480 --> 34:59.040]  babies so that's what the medical doctor said Anita does that answer your
[34:59.040 --> 35:04.320]  question yeah thank you I missed Thursday I missed all last week but she was
[35:04.320 --> 35:08.160]  also concerned about he's she's having a boy is the circumcision you know what
[35:08.160 --> 35:13.360]  they get she what those shots they give for that or she has to have epidural or
[35:13.360 --> 35:19.200]  a C-section you know she's concerned about all that well doctors doctors are
[35:19.200 --> 35:23.120]  in a hurry and they like C-sections because they don't have to wait 15
[35:23.120 --> 35:27.480]  hours while there's a delivery now over half of American women have C-sections
[35:27.480 --> 35:31.360]  pretty soon they're going to say it's a conspiracy theory that women ever had
[35:31.360 --> 35:35.160]  children vaginally the normal way pretty soon they're going to say it's a
[35:35.160 --> 35:41.560]  conspiracy theory that mammary glands in mammals breast are meant to give milk to
[35:41.560 --> 35:46.960]  babies it's not a conspiracy women once had babies the regular way they once
[35:46.960 --> 35:51.280]  breastfed their children I know it sounds radical sounds wild but I
[35:51.280 --> 35:56.480]  appreciate your call Anita let's talk to Anna in New York Anna you're on the
[35:56.480 --> 36:01.200]  air go ahead hi Alex I've been listening to you for about a year and a half now
[36:01.200 --> 36:04.040]  maybe two years and I've also been listening to Glenbeck for about as long
[36:04.040 --> 36:10.200]  as for about as long and I heard you and I'm like I I just don't I don't get it
[36:10.200 --> 36:16.520]  because you're saying that Glenn Beck sky he mocked Lord Monson when he was
[36:16.520 --> 36:24.200]  talking about the the Copenhagen coming up and the and the treaty and and that
[36:24.200 --> 36:29.960]  he was also he also supported tarp I think it was tarp but I've never heard
[36:29.960 --> 36:35.040]  Glenn Beck support the um the okay I've never I've never heard him support
[36:35.040 --> 36:40.120]  either man do you have a computer do you have a computer I do yeah okay I once
[36:40.120 --> 36:45.120]  you to write this down there's hundreds of these clips but the shortest and
[36:45.120 --> 36:50.560]  best one I've seen is about five minutes long and it's titled Glenn Beck is a
[36:50.560 --> 36:56.640]  neocon not a libertarian and you will see him over and over again call Ron Paul
[36:56.640 --> 37:04.560]  a kook and a nut you will see him say that we needed the banker bailout but
[37:04.560 --> 37:08.920]  after it passed he then came out and said it was bad and he was against it
[37:08.920 --> 37:13.920]  whenever they're having a key vote he shows his true colors that's what I'm
[37:13.920 --> 37:18.200]  saying you keep your friends close your enemies closer the establishment has a
[37:18.200 --> 37:22.880]  lot of these quote anti-establishment people on the right now the
[37:22.880 --> 37:26.320]  Republicans are out of power they will act like they're against the New World
[37:26.320 --> 37:31.400]  Order but then they flip-flop and I'm gonna play a clip of Hannity calling
[37:31.400 --> 37:36.640]  Ron Paul a nut here in just a moment so what I'm telling you is at key points
[37:36.640 --> 37:41.800]  they snipe I know he's had Lord Moncton on I know he's admitted a lot of this I
[37:41.800 --> 37:47.400]  understand that but what I'm telling you is look if you've been listening for a
[37:47.400 --> 37:51.560]  year and a half you know that about nine months ago I predicted that Beck would
[37:51.560 --> 37:57.080]  come out and debunk FEMA camps and I even said how he would debunk them okay
[37:57.080 --> 38:00.840]  and he would go show a few camps that weren't camps and then say there were no
[38:00.840 --> 38:04.040]  camps even when it's in the Houston Chronicle in New York Times and Wall
[38:04.040 --> 38:09.320]  Street Journal and they've introduced legislation to build more camps so
[38:09.320 --> 38:14.160]  that's what I'm saying is that that's what makes them so dangerous is that
[38:14.160 --> 38:19.520]  they're getting everybody's look Ron Paul started the Tea Parties 9-11 true
[38:19.520 --> 38:23.360]  started the Tea Parties they have taken them over now to make it a
[38:23.360 --> 38:28.360]  Republicanoid you know Rhino type organization but look I don't want to
[38:28.360 --> 38:31.680]  get off into bashing these people here okay I mean at least they're admitting
[38:31.680 --> 38:36.440]  some of this stuff my point is is that is that I I've been deeply studying this
[38:36.440 --> 38:41.880]  for years and I under look Benedict Arnold you know who Benedict Arnold was
[38:41.880 --> 38:46.320]  Benedict Arnold was an American he was American general one of our greatest
[38:46.320 --> 38:50.640]  generals and it turned out he'd been a British agent the whole time and and I
[38:50.640 --> 38:56.960]  know one of these people when I see it ma'am this is all I do is study this okay
[38:56.960 --> 39:01.880]  Lou Dobbs didn't go as far as Glenn Beck does but what he did do was never stab
[39:01.880 --> 39:05.840]  Patriots in the back that's why his house got shot up that's why Mecha and
[39:05.840 --> 39:10.200]  Laraza came after him and that's why CNN made him quit that's now been reported
[39:10.200 --> 39:15.800]  why he why why he was forced out Lou Dobbs has been on this show okay I have
[39:15.800 --> 39:21.200]  seen Glenn Beck say we need to use the army against Ron Paul supporters he said
[39:21.200 --> 39:25.840]  Ron Paul's money bombs mean that we want to blow things up that's not true he has
[39:25.840 --> 39:29.640]  ma'am you need to do more studying okay
[39:29.640 --> 39:34.280]  look for that video that you just talked about and one last thing I work near
[39:34.280 --> 39:39.040]  Columbus Circle in Manhattan and I gotta tell you I have noticed an increased
[39:39.040 --> 39:43.120]  presence military presence police presence there over the past few months
[39:43.120 --> 39:48.880]  and it's and I find it I find it scary and and the other day I was walking out
[39:48.880 --> 39:55.000]  of my office building and I noticed I noticed for the first time a camera on
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.280]  the pole from the sidewalk and then another one a couple of blocks over and
[40:00.280 --> 40:05.320]  I'm noticing these things popping up it's popping up ma'am absolutely and I
[40:05.320 --> 40:11.440]  appreciate your call look 12 years ago I remember reading government documents
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.680]  on air how they plan to put cameras in nationwide claiming it would be for
[40:15.680 --> 40:19.320]  traffic but that was really for surveillance now they admit it's
[40:19.320 --> 40:25.800]  surveilling us face scanning software sucked into them license plate reading
[40:25.800 --> 40:30.560]  software the Homeland Security documents that we leaked that we receive
[40:30.560 --> 40:35.880]  that were leaked to us confirmed to be real say that Homeland Security is
[40:35.880 --> 40:40.800]  really for gun owners conservatives and Liberty lovers that's what I'm trying to
[40:40.800 --> 40:46.080]  tell you ma'am is that this whole Homeland Security system is not for Al
[40:46.080 --> 40:52.160]  Ciada it is for the American people the legislation has been introduced to
[40:52.160 --> 40:57.720]  effectively ban guns but Obama lies and says none of that exists they play the
[40:57.720 --> 41:02.160]  stonewalling game with us so we can never have a real political debate about
[41:02.160 --> 41:07.080]  all this information let's go to another caller here let's talk to Ronnie in
[41:07.080 --> 41:12.240]  Texas Ronnie you're on the air welcome thank you sir I hope to help expose the
[41:12.240 --> 41:17.320]  tyranny that I'm now fighting for our first amendment that is in the Travis
[41:17.320 --> 41:21.200]  County Commissioners Court they've come up with a largely abusive unconstitutional
[41:21.200 --> 41:26.080]  attack on my rise to where your controversial t-shirts like 9-11 with
[41:26.080 --> 41:30.800]  an anti-job various Obama Joker or Ron Paul t-shirts or don't trade on me or

[41:48.240 --> 41:52.960]  bumping their shoulders into me telling me I better not speak you're telling me
[41:52.960 --> 41:58.040]  that the Travis County Commissioners Court has told you you can't wear 9-11
[41:58.040 --> 42:03.280]  as an inside job t-shirts they're doing a draft proposal on a new law they

[42:13.440 --> 42:17.320]  that yesterday incredibly the local Austin American spaceman did a big story
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.160]  all about this they took a picture of me with my t-shirts in my truck with my
[42:22.160 --> 42:26.000]  various you know Ron Paul stickers in 9-11 with an inside job and look they're
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.120]  gonna lose in court in 10 seconds they can't if if they try to restrict your
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.560]  political messages the first time you watch Commissioners Court and somebody's

[42:41.320 --> 42:45.240]  Obama shirt you're gonna own the Commissioners Court but this shows

[47:01.480 --> 47:07.380]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[47:07.380 --> 47:11.440]  Broadcasting Network Network
[47:25.360 --> 47:30.360]  all of our counties all of our cities have been centralized the National
[47:30.360 --> 47:34.560]  Association of Counties National Association of Cities National
[47:34.560 --> 47:38.000]  Association of Governors it's all centralized we're getting the same laws
[47:38.000 --> 47:43.360]  Australia and Canada and England and Germany are getting when the IMF comes
[47:43.360 --> 47:47.840]  in and bankrupts your country by design they give you hundreds of rules you've
[47:47.840 --> 47:51.960]  got to follow and all over the world free speech is being thrown out all over
[47:51.960 --> 47:56.680]  the world police are taking DNA and blood samples without warrants all over
[47:56.680 --> 48:01.320]  the world classical freedoms being destroyed and classical tyranny is
[48:01.320 --> 48:07.880]  replacing it now I want to shift gears for the lady who called in earlier and
[48:07.880 --> 48:12.720]  was saying I never hear the so-called conservatives attacking Ron Paul well
[48:12.720 --> 48:17.520]  if you're missing it I don't know how you're missing it because I'm not even
[48:17.520 --> 48:22.400]  watching these shows and I see the clips every few days coming up in a moment
[48:22.400 --> 48:26.680]  Hannity says Ron Paul is nuts while he had Chuck Norris one of our frequent
[48:26.680 --> 48:31.600]  guests on the show but first I want to play a clip we have this article posted
[48:31.600 --> 48:35.120]  at prisonplanet.com and infowars.net if you want to watch the whole video clip
[48:35.120 --> 48:39.560]  I'm just gonna play part of it Chuck Norris Copenhagen talks to forge one
[48:39.560 --> 48:45.680]  world order now notice Norris is saying I think this is what they're going to do
[48:45.680 --> 48:51.800]  no Bankind Moon the head of the UN the secretary general wrote an editorial for
[48:51.800 --> 48:56.320]  the New York Times titled we can do it where he said global government global
[48:56.320 --> 49:01.960]  governance the greenhouse tax will pet will finance this and this allows an
[49:01.960 --> 49:06.320]  unelected private group to run our lives this bypasses Congress just like the
[49:06.320 --> 49:10.000]  World Trade Organization bypasses Congress on trade that's why we can
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.680]  never get a napkin cat which is deindustrialized our country so here
[49:14.680 --> 49:20.760]  is the first clip of Chuck Norris on Neil Cavuto but if my next guest is
[49:20.760 --> 49:25.000]  right the fine print shows something else could get hammered by this our way
[49:25.000 --> 49:31.080]  of life Chuck Norris's latest book is the Chuck Norris fact book one under one
[49:31.080 --> 49:34.200]  of Chuck's favorite facts and stories it's actually very funny but it does have
[49:34.200 --> 49:37.640]  a couple of serious points I do want to share but Chuck great to see you let's
[49:37.640 --> 49:41.000]  see you too Neil well actually that you know the conference starts from the day
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.880]  the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor does it really summer 7th so that's some
[49:45.880 --> 49:48.680]  communication right there is the president about last time I went to
[49:48.680 --> 49:52.560]  Copenhagen didn't turn out too well but but is it gonna go I don't know if he
[49:52.560 --> 49:57.320]  is or not I don't know if he's gonna send his son the Hillary who knows what
[49:57.320 --> 50:00.560]  he's going to do well Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is one of those who's
[50:00.560 --> 50:04.520]  been espousing sort of updating the Kyoto Accord this global environmental
[50:04.520 --> 50:08.520]  sort of watch truthfully I think he will go and you think he's going to make
[50:08.520 --> 50:12.600]  some big concessions oh I definitely I really think he's going over there to
[50:12.600 --> 50:18.800]  try to create a one-world order and I think what's your big worry my big worry
[50:18.800 --> 50:26.960]  is the fact is that we as a nation if we start having to be obligated to other
[50:26.960 --> 50:30.440]  countries like in this conference they're going to try to take our money
[50:30.440 --> 50:35.280]  and send it to third-world countries because of since we spent so much oil
[50:35.280 --> 50:38.840]  and these other countries have suffered then we're gonna give our money to these
[50:38.840 --> 50:45.720]  third-world countries Neil we have people here starving in our own country I you
[50:45.720 --> 50:51.120]  know my foundation I have kids families who are making $9,000 a year with the
[50:51.120 --> 50:56.120]  kids that I'm teaching why aren't we trying to help our the poverty in our
[50:56.120 --> 51:02.240]  own country but isn't this just about cleaner global you don't buy that I
[51:02.240 --> 51:07.000]  don't buy that I don't buy you know I'll go became a hundred million dollar
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.920]  millionaire you know from this global bombargle but I I don't really I don't
[51:11.920 --> 51:15.840]  believe it for a second I think it's a big con game that they're doing but
[51:15.840 --> 51:19.680]  nevertheless you fear that the president is going to concede and give these
[51:19.680 --> 51:24.160]  countries what they want to be part of this globalist tradition and then what
[51:24.160 --> 51:29.360]  happens who knows what's going to happen you know that God forbids this even
[51:29.360 --> 51:35.960]  the that this happens in our country I our country as we know it now well no
[51:35.960 --> 51:39.040]  longer exist Neil that's the whole thing right well the proponents and
[51:39.040 --> 51:42.560]  Copenhagen there and the beautiful people you oh yeah very attractive yeah
[51:42.560 --> 51:46.560]  spent too much time in Fallujah you should have a good out but but they they
[51:46.560 --> 51:49.480]  say we'll have a cleaner world than everyone will be happy including Chuck
[51:49.480 --> 51:52.680]  Norris what I don't believe that I don't believe that first of all I don't
[51:52.680 --> 51:55.840]  believe China is going to go for this I don't believe in this gonna go for this
[51:55.840 --> 51:58.960]  and they're not going to start you know China is the world's biggest polluter I
[51:58.960 --> 52:02.680]  know they are and they're not gonna change and I so the thing is for them to
[52:02.680 --> 52:06.680]  say well the United States you change but we're not gonna change you know so you
[52:06.680 --> 52:11.640]  clean up your country but I'm gonna keep you know polluting our part of the
[52:11.640 --> 52:18.560]  world okay you know it's ludicrous now let's break this down number one Chuck
[52:18.560 --> 52:25.640]  gets it a little bit wrong here but he's learning he's growing he's saying oh
[52:25.640 --> 52:28.920]  we're gonna give money to the third world to help them because we've hurt
[52:28.920 --> 52:32.560]  them but look America's not doing too good this isn't gonna go to the third
[52:32.560 --> 52:35.840]  world that's how the globalists are selling at the IMF and World Bank
[52:35.840 --> 52:40.000]  private banks took our tax money they went in at 30 percent interest that's
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.880]  paid to private banks with our money and took over those countries those
[52:43.880 --> 52:48.200]  countries hate the IMF and World Bank they're not stupid most of third world
[52:48.200 --> 52:52.400]  nations are against the Copenhagen Treaty they understand because they've
[52:52.400 --> 52:56.600]  read the actual UN documents that it's meant to freeze global industrial
[52:56.600 --> 53:01.480]  development in the West and the first world but also in the third world in
[53:01.480 --> 53:05.680]  developing world and Chuck gets it right when he points out that China India
[53:05.680 --> 53:10.720]  Mexico and 160 plus other third world countries they have to make zero carbon
[53:10.720 --> 53:15.040]  emissions cuts so even if you believe carbon dioxide is a deadly chemical and
[53:15.040 --> 53:18.600]  hurts everybody and that plants don't breathe them then it's bad when plants
[53:18.600 --> 53:24.600]  do breathe it and it's good shutting off our carbon dioxide emissions and
[53:24.600 --> 53:29.000]  moving it to China and India where they have no controls will actually boost the
[53:29.000 --> 53:34.640]  amount of carbon and all the studies show that so this is the mega fraud that
[53:34.640 --> 53:38.880]  we're talking about and look I've covered repeatedly here on air in fact I
[53:38.880 --> 53:45.720]  have the treaty right here in my stack I'll show it to folks on television here
[53:45.720 --> 53:49.680]  it is framework convention on climate change read the 200 pages all about
[53:49.680 --> 53:55.640]  global government taxing everything having a private IMF bank forming the
[53:55.640 --> 53:59.160]  new world government with its own army its own taxes that trump our national
[53:59.160 --> 54:03.240]  sovereignty and then I have all these other articles like out of the Times of
[54:03.240 --> 54:06.360]  London with the headline
[54:06.520 --> 54:12.320]  worlds rich meet in secret to discuss population control and it's all about how
[54:12.320 --> 54:17.360]  they want to reduce our numbers why did Lou Dobbs get attacked why did he get
[54:17.360 --> 54:20.680]  run out of seeing in because he would talk about the North American Union we've
[54:20.680 --> 54:23.960]  been in a North American Union since 2005 when they signed the thing in Waco
[54:23.960 --> 54:28.920]  Texas all we're doing is covering what's real all we're doing is covering
[54:28.920 --> 54:33.400]  what's on the record now let's go to this next clip this is later in the day
[54:33.400 --> 54:42.080]  he's on there with his wife this is Chuck Norris again Chuck Norris on Sean
[54:42.080 --> 54:48.640]  Hannity and he's told this story really first on this radio show I guess four or
[54:48.640 --> 54:52.960]  five months ago about Alex you know what I want to do he said I want to have Ron
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.240]  Paul point out who's corrupt and who's not on the Democrat Republican side I'm
[54:57.240 --> 55:01.240]  gonna punch him in the face or choke him out he tries to tell the story and
[55:01.240 --> 55:06.760]  Sean Hannity throws out well Ron Paul's a nut and then Chuck comes back with
[55:06.760 --> 55:13.680]  well that's why I like him because I'm a nut he says he's a nut that's why I
[55:13.680 --> 55:18.600]  like him I'm a nut yeah Ron Paul's a nut because he knows how to read UN
[55:18.600 --> 55:23.800]  documents Ron Paul said ten years ago that by 2010 they would devalue the
[55:23.800 --> 55:27.600]  dollar because he'd read their own documents I mean all we do here is read
[55:27.600 --> 55:33.400]  what the globalists say they're going to do here is Chuck Norris with the
[55:33.400 --> 55:36.680]  creature I mean think about all the national
[55:36.680 --> 55:41.520]  conservative talk show hosts for decade after decade that have said that there
[55:41.520 --> 55:45.520]  is no such thing as global government and now it's all being announced and
[55:45.520 --> 55:50.320]  they're still saying there isn't think about that you don't hear him apologize
[55:50.320 --> 55:57.640]  do you here it is and if it was I was I said I would go to Congress I'd line up
[55:57.640 --> 56:01.360]  every member of Congress and I'd have Ron Paul who I believe is the probably
[56:01.360 --> 56:04.760]  the one more honest ones there I say Ron point out the honest I like Ron Paul
[56:04.760 --> 56:09.920]  he's nuts yeah I don't know I like him all right well he's nuts but I bet me
[56:09.920 --> 56:13.600]  right I truck out the dense I ever dishonest politician that's up there but
[56:13.600 --> 56:17.680]  you are you of the philosophy I know that's both of you you don't think there's
[56:17.680 --> 56:20.480]  a dime's worth the difference between the two parties are you you sort of make
[56:20.480 --> 56:23.120]  the case that there's too much Republican Democrat I tell you I'm very
[56:23.120 --> 56:27.440]  disappointed because we had a Republican majority and they blew it and they blew
[56:27.440 --> 56:32.800]  it and we had to be Bush and they could have made a strong policy that's good
[56:32.800 --> 56:37.200]  in our country you know I've talked to Chuck Norris privately two years ago a
[56:37.200 --> 56:41.320]  year ago five six months ago and I said Chuck look at their records because he
[56:41.320 --> 56:45.840]  was still pushing this Republican line and I said look they're there to control
[56:45.840 --> 56:50.000]  real conservatives we're the real natural enemy libertarians conservatives
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.360]  constitutionalist of the globalist and so notice how they always give us lip
[56:55.360 --> 56:59.080]  service but sell us out if you want to beat the New World Order you've got to
[56:59.080 --> 57:03.360]  truly take over the Republican Party with a patriot movement because the
[57:03.360 --> 57:08.600]  Democrats are globalist all the way you've got to take over the Republican
[57:08.600 --> 57:11.720]  Party you can't let these rhinos continue to control and he said you're right
[57:11.720 --> 57:16.160]  Alex you're right you're right so Chuck is really starting to step it up and do
[57:16.160 --> 57:20.840]  the right thing and he's got Hannity sitting there sniping at Ron Paul and
[57:20.840 --> 57:25.280]  it's disgusting look we know Anderson Cooper's for world government we know
[57:25.280 --> 57:29.920]  Barack Obama is they won't deny it they're pushing it instead the fake
[57:29.920 --> 57:34.400]  conservatives are there saying none of it exists we're nuts because we'll read
[57:34.400 --> 57:38.840]  official UN treaties no we're not nuts we're right and you know it and your

[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:09.840]  but I guess you had a refeed going yes well anyway I wanted to call and tell
[1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:13.160]  you about the health care reform bill and the cap and trade bill the health
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:20.120]  care reform bill supposed to pass on Tuesday I it's going to the full floor on
[1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:26.840]  the 17th after Fox News told us over and over again that it was never gonna pass
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:30.720]  the house and then never gonna get out a committee in the Senate oh lo and
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:35.000]  behold it looks like it is did you see the show Wednesday or hear it when I
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.240]  played the Fox News clips where they bragged that they're for global warming
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:42.960]  tax oh yes sir at the beginning of the I don't know what was the third hour I think
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:47.680]  I don't know but I I actually took that show I uploaded the YouTube but I got
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:51.720]  like no views but you got like a less than a hundred views unfortunately I
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:56.080]  made a thread on the closing planet board that I got the moderator saying
[1:01:56.080 --> 1:02:01.600]  just taking a thread but with the I had to stop that I there was even a one clip
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:06.400]  where it says a let's say flashback Obama stating he's against forced
[1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:10.320]  insurance those were during the debate before he got elected as president
[1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:14.800]  actually wasn't elected to be selected but I know that by the way the health
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:24.520]  care and bill is more like a health care takeover talk so sabotage bill
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:28.520]  ruins everything it's just the private banks through government seizing more
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:34.640]  of our economy I appreciate your call listen we post the TV and radio show in
[1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:40.040]  higher quality to prison planet TV for members but then it also gets posted to
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:44.480]  the Alex Jones channel and you know the average video gets 10,000 views in a
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:48.840]  week but hundreds of other smaller channels may get thousands may get
[1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:52.200]  hundreds but a lot of you doing that together has a lot of power so don't
[1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:56.560]  feel bad that you reached a hundred people really that's a great job let's
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:03:05.360]  go to Julio in Illinois go ahead Alex how are you good I just want to thank you
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:09.880]  so much for all you have done I started listening to you since the summer you've
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:13.520]  really inspired me I go to school here at Western Illinois University and the
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:19.640]  comb Illinois they're handing out free h1n1 nasal vaccinations and the regular
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:23.400]  injections and you know what the medical doctors say they handed out the
[1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:28.560]  nasal first because the insert admits it actually spreads the real flu right and
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:34.640]  I read I read those inserts from the exact same pharmaceutical company that
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:38.680]  was distributing these nasal vaccines and I was out at these clinics handing
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:45.680]  out the documents to people and we had the university health doctors you know
[1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:50.400]  handing out reports from the CDC and one of the their members was calling me a
[1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:55.040]  conspiracy theorist and pointing and laughing at me and I see that's key
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:58.600]  that's key hold on just a minute because that's what happens they have the
[1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:03.960]  doctors out handing out fake myth sheets that say no mercury can't cause
[1:04:03.960 --> 1:04:08.360]  Guillain beret can't cause all these disorders and then you have the actual
[1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:16.280]  insert from the vaccine company and you're a conspiracy theorist that's
[1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:21.480]  what you're saying right yeah that's what they do nationwide so what did you

[1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:22.640]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:27.400]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:31.200]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:34.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[1:06:19.640 --> 1:06:23.520]  all right coming up I'm gonna get into all the important developments
[1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:28.360]  concerning the flu the deaths the illnesses being caused by the vaccine
[1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:33.400]  all over the world it's in the Sunday Express it's in the Associated Press it's
[1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:39.000]  in Time Magazine everywhere admitting that deaths are occurring people are
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.720]  getting sick from the flu shot they started the same a similar swine flu
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:49.120]  shot back in 1976 and for a few months denied deaths were happening but it got
[1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:54.240]  so big the number of deaths and it got so big in the local media they had to
[1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:59.520]  come out and admit it and suspend the flu inoculation program now top
[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:04.440]  scientists in Ukraine are saying they believe that the different vaccines have
[1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:09.600]  mutated in the human body making this new super flu so we're gonna be going
[1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:13.320]  over that after we take some more phone calls first I wanted to go back to an
[1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:21.360]  article we wrote at info wars.com on May 3rd Obama supports treaty outlawing gun
[1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:28.440]  possession and this was first reported back in May of this year that Obama was
[1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:37.960]  looking at bypassing Congress because if the president can sign a treaty he can
[1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:42.240]  then bypass Congress with laws that's what the Copenhagen Treaty is on
[1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:49.080]  greenhouse gas well here's world net daily Obama revives talk of UN gun
[1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:53.640]  controlled gun rights supporters are up in arms a repair of moves the White
[1:07:53.640 --> 1:07:58.160]  House made in the past month to reverse long-standing US policy and begin
[1:07:58.160 --> 1:08:01.680]  negotiating a gun control treaty with the United Nations Secretary of State
[1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:06.000]  Hillary Clinton first announced October 14th that the US had changed its stance
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:09.440]  and would support negotiations on the arms trade treaty to regulate
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:13.080]  international gun trafficking a measure the Bush administration said notably
[1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:17.280]  former president and permanent UN representative the United Nations John
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:22.080]  Bolton opposed for years two years ago in another reversal of policy the US
[1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:30.880]  joined a number of UN organizations 153 to 1 vote to adopt a resolution setting
[1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:35.240]  out a timetable on the proposed arms treaty including a UN conference to
[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:40.160]  produce a final accord the conventional arms transfers are crucial
[1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:45.760]  national security concern for the United States and we have always supported
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:49.240]  effective action to control the international transfer of arms Clinton
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:53.440]  said in a statement the United States is prepared to work hard for a strong
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:58.360]  international standard in this area so that means a UN law over the US gun
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:01.840]  rights advocates are calling the reversal both the dangerous submission of
[1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:05.360]  American constitutional rights to international governance and an attempt
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:10.080]  by the Obama administration to sneak into effect private gun control laws it
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:19.440]  couldn't pass through Congress now Reuters reported on this last Wednesday
[1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:25.080]  US reverses stance on treaty to regulate arms trade and when you read this
[1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:29.840]  treaty it's clear that they can basically ban the Second Amendment under
[1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:36.200]  this under UN law and that's in another article that came out on Friday the
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:43.080]  13th Friday November 13th out of the Washington Post task force seeks ban on
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:47.480]  assault weapons that's any semi-automatic handgun or rifle under the
[1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:53.120]  assault weapons ban group also wants overhaul of Mexican border agencies a
[1:09:53.120 --> 1:09:58.520]  bi-national task force that means made up of foreign governments US and Mexico
[1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:03.000]  border issues will call Friday on the Obama administration in Congress and
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:07.080]  they did call for it to reinstate an expired ban on assault weapons and for
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:12.320]  Mexico to overhaul its frontier police and customs agency to mirror the US
[1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:16.200]  Department of Homeland Security so merging those under the SPP North
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:19.600]  American Union agreement the recommendations among a broad set of
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:23.240]  security trade development and international proposals that come as
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:27.520]  President Obama and his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderon move to
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:32.320]  deepen engagement on issues including economic recovery climate change you
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:36.680]  hear that that means taxes illegal immigration and narcotics trafficking
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:40.720]  and then I have another New York Times article that deals with that meeting
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:45.360]  and what was said at that Friday meeting this came out Friday the 13th as
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:50.800]  well White House plans on immigrations include legal status legalizing the
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:56.040]  illegals now think about this we have the Mexican government in this
[1:10:56.040 --> 1:11:00.600]  multi-Congress meeting deciding what's going to happen with our immigration and
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:06.760]  calling for gun laws in the US Mexico has a complete gun ban for its citizens
[1:11:06.760 --> 1:11:11.440]  and they have a much higher crime rate than we do in war on the streets all
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:15.920]  disarmament of the citizens does is empower corrupt government and street
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:19.720]  thugs low-level criminals and high-level criminals to have their way with the
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:23.480]  people that's why Chicago's got such high crime highest in the country next to
[1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:29.240]  New York because it's victim disarmament period that is what's happening I like
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:37.120]  to hear from listeners on that subject at 888-201-2244-888-201-2244 and get
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:42.280]  your response to that but meanwhile the media keeps running national news story
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:48.000]  saying it's a conspiracy theory crazy people for a year have had record gun
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:52.960]  sales at gun shops and gun shows and private sales record sales and we've
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:57.680]  got a ban gun shows because people are buying guns because they think Obama
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:05.480]  wants their guns well 15 bills 15 bills have been introduced that we've
[1:12:05.480 --> 1:12:09.800]  identified we've had gunners of America had Larry Pratt on many times to break
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:16.600]  down those bills each one of the bills more draconian in the 1968 gun control
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:21.720]  act one bill that's got a bunch of co-sponsors right now allows the
[1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:25.680]  attorney general to ban any and all guns with the stroke of a pen it just gives
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:28.960]  him the power to ban guns it will there's other bills that say if you're on
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:33.920]  the no fly list a million 200,000 Americans on it no judge no jury no
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:39.800]  proof extra judicial totally out of 1984 Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany it's
[1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:47.760]  Kafka s to the maximum they state that in fact they have the bill introduced no
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:52.920]  fly no buy is the name of the bill but simultaneously it's being confirmed
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:57.480]  they're just denying people that are on the no fly people without the law
[1:12:57.480 --> 1:13:02.040]  without even passing it that's kind of like a whole bunch of states have now
[1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:06.480]  reported we've gotten the training manuals for the states that states are
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:11.080]  getting ready to start withholding out of your paycheck for insurance federally
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:15.000]  even though they haven't passed the health care bill the government takeover
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:23.120]  Obamacare by the way Wednesday I may even play this again today it's so important
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:28.120]  Wednesday I played a news core promotional video that they released as a
[1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:35.560]  press release a five-minute video where it shows dozens of Fox TV shows and
[1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:41.920]  movies bragging that they're putting out the message that global warming is real
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:46.000]  and it's man-made and global taxes are good
[1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:52.800]  simultaneously Fox TV shows are on record so are ABC CBS NBC getting
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:59.280]  government paychecks to implant messages not product placement like Doritos or
[1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:03.200]  Budweiser ads on TV those are already there inside the TV shows not just the
[1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:06.160]  ads when they go to commercial but but you know inside the program it's like
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:11.120]  Wayne's world where they're drinking beer and holding up bags of Doritos or when
[1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:15.880]  you see a James Bond movie and it's got Jaguars an advertiser in it they paid
[1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:21.160]  for that or the apprentice was getting three million dollars an episode for a
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:27.240]  while from Virgin Airlines to have Donald Trump talk about Virgin Airlines
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:33.240]  propaganda placement using your tax money to put messages but but the reason I
[1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:38.800]  single out Fox is on Fox News some of their shows say man-made global warming
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:46.560]  isn't real but I've noticed that in the New York Post and on all the major news
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:52.920]  core owned TV stations and newspapers they keep saying don't worry the
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:57.200]  climate bill won't pass the house don't worry that the the health bill won't
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:03.200]  pass the house don't worry don't worry don't worry so the natural enemy of
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:08.280]  these takeovers conservatives and libertarians will stand down and I get
[1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:13.120]  emails saying oh it's not going to pass then it all passed the house then two
[1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:18.200]  weeks ago the New York Post and others reported don't worry the health care
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:22.840]  bill will never even pass the committee out of the Senate it did pass out a
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:25.920]  committee they're going to try to vote on it Tuesday and Wednesday they're
[1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:32.000]  going to try to pass the health care bill this week and instead I'm spending
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:37.280]  my time trying to convince people this is even happening because we've got
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:41.160]  people inside the gates in our fortress Fortress America the Republic
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:46.000]  telling us open the drawbridge everything's fine so they're coming
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.920]  after our guns they're trying to get rid of our borders and our sovereignty
[1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:53.520]  they're letting unelected UN groups control our national policy they're
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:57.520]  trying to pass all this legislation right now to totally take over our
[1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:02.080]  country a private corporate takeover is taking place have you heard that

[1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:53.400]  covered yet but several program notes Charlie Sheen wrote a letter to President
[1:20:53.400 --> 1:20:58.720]  Obama concerning questions about 9-11 one of them is the fact that the New York
[1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:03.600]  Times the Washington Post have written stories many of the 9-11 Commission
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:09.520]  members have written books John Farmer the head counsel for the Commission said
[1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:15.040]  it was a criminal cover-up a fraud a conspiracy and if six of the 10
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:18.760]  Commission members are saying it's a fraud a cover-up a lie shouldn't there
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:23.080]  be a new investigation so Charlie and I had the idea to have a competition
[1:21:23.080 --> 1:21:29.920]  $14,000 prize to first place thousand to second place 500 to second $500 for
[1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:35.240]  third place to take the script of that letter to the president 20 minutes with

[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:07.840]  comment if I can get to both of them please go ahead my question is deputy
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:13.960]  director counterterrorism John O'Neill the one that was murdered he in the film
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:19.160]  he claimed that there was a bill or a law passed by the Clinton and Bush
[1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:24.320]  administration stopped him from going after al Qaeda and yes the bin Laden
[1:25:24.320 --> 1:25:28.720]  yes I cannot find that is there any kind of a link I could find that PDF file or
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:33.440]  some kind of John O'Neill in the six months before he was that former head
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:39.120]  of counterterrorism he quit the FBI and went public and he was interviewed by
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:46.120]  the London independent and by several other papers and there was also a this
[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:53.880]  is all my film road to tyranny from that release in February of 2002 and in
[1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:58.600]  there we have the New Yorker magazine talking about him and they did an
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:04.080]  article and he went to the British news mainly it was even stronger than the
[1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:07.560]  than the few papers in the US and magazines like New Yorker magazine he
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:12.640]  said they're gonna let bin Laden attack America as a pretext to attack
[1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:20.320]  Afghanistan and then he was hired by the security company that was run by
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:28.720]  Marvin Bush and his first day of work in the towers was 9-11 so and then they
[1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:31.520]  reported they found his uncharted body then they said they found his charred
[1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:36.800]  body a lot of different weird reports but he did die on the towers but if
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:40.560]  there any documentary proof to his claim though I mean as far as not well
[1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:45.440]  sir I mean he was the FBI he was a deputy director they have more than one he
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:49.560]  was the head of counterterrorism I mean he's a very credible person he gave
[1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:57.960]  those interviews so look us I appreciate your call Steve Butler Steven Butler
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:05.560]  told the Sacramento be the San Jose Mercury news and the AP a month after
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:09.880]  9-11 he won't do interviews now he was threatened he said I don't know what
[1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:14.040]  happened with 9-11 but Muhammad and others were trained in our bases and
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:22.360]  were trained at the military base that he was the head of he was the dean of the
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:27.520]  defense language school in Monterey California I mean it was in news week
[1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:31.720]  that hijackers were trained at US bases that's what the 9-11 Commission has
[1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:35.880]  talked about being the fraud I mean that's the point we don't know exactly
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:40.720]  what happened on 9-11 we just know it stinks to high heaven and was used to
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:45.920]  launch all these wars and take our freedoms it's also been all over the
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:49.880]  foreign media now that the US government is protecting Taliban al-Qaeda in
[1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:56.040]  Afghanistan and Pakistan remember the times of London early 2002 this is in my
[1:27:56.040 --> 1:28:00.600]  film road to tyranny the screenshots of the newspaper headlines that 6,000
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:05.240]  Taliban al-Qaeda cream that was in the different articles that term cream the
[1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:09.880]  commanders every time our troops would capture them they were ordered to release
[1:28:09.880 --> 1:28:16.720]  them and fly them out to safety on C-130s into Pakistan I mean don't forget
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:21.560]  that al-Qaeda and Taliban were founded by the United States don't forget to
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:26.400]  attack the Russians don't forget that Jimmy Carter's national security
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:32.040]  advisors of big to Brzezinski has written two books bragging how in 79 he
[1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:37.400]  created these groups to attack the Russians out of Afghanistan to get the
[1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:41.560]  Russians to invade Afghanistan they were using Afghanistan as a base to attack
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:47.680]  Uzbekistan Turkmenistan and other Russian influenced areas it's like Saddam
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:54.280]  Hussein was CIA Mussolini was CIA Hitler was CIA we'll be right back after this
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:58.880]  break they create the boogeymen they use Muslim extremists to overthrow Iran in

[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:28.880]  gold antitrust group on a group of major gold mines that have joined together
[1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:34.240]  to sue the UN and the private Federal Reserve for artificially suppressing the
[1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:41.320]  price of gold to what it should be worth under indexed inflation now it's in the
[1:33:41.320 --> 1:33:49.240]  London Telegraph Barrick shuts Hedgebook as world gold supply runs out and there
[1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:53.440]  they are millions of ounces behind a year producing the gold that there is
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:34:00.840]  demand for that's why gold is above $1,120 an ounce right now so a decade
[1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:07.760]  later we're proven right yet again and a decade later weak dollar no quick fix
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:12.680]  for narrowing trade gap first they denied the dollar was being devalued now
[1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:17.600]  they say oh it's going to be good for manufacturing to have a cheaper dollar
[1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:22.240]  because maybe some manufacturing will come back no China and India and Mexico

[1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:50.560]  beloved Republic is being taken over by criminal offshore banks and and people
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:56.000]  are starting to wake up but not fast enough yeah here yeah hey I had a couple
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:00.400]  of comments a couple questions um you know one of the things that I think
[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:03.560]  about whenever I hear that Chuck Norris thing is that you know it seems like
[1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:07.880]  the Kavuto kept asking his opinion instead of asking him what he knew about
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:14.720]  stuff and it just seems like it were more engaged in opinions and facts these
[1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:19.960]  days in the mainstream media well it's more than that see Kavuto knows that
[1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:24.320]  Rupert Murdoch wants the global tax and so it's their job to pose as if they're
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:28.080]  fair and balanced or conservative and so he was like but wait they just want to
[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:33.760]  clean up the earth those folks in Copenhagen they're real nice as if the
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:38.160]  folks in Copenhagen as if the people in Denmark are bad that's where the world
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:44.200]  government is based one of the major so so so that's where they have the the
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:49.640]  these big international bodies and so oh well you're Chuck you don't want you
[1:35:49.640 --> 1:35:53.840]  you don't want to clean up the earth you know carbon dioxide is deadly Chuck
[1:35:53.840 --> 1:35:59.120]  plants breathe it Chuck we better put a tax on it it's not that the big bankers
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:04.360]  you we're going to be paying taxes oh and Kavuto talked about how Gore made a
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:10.680]  hundred million goers made over a billion dollars off this stuff so far
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:15.880]  called hoping Hagan by the way I don't want you to get it wrong you know you're
[1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:21.480]  saying you pronounce it hoping Hagan there's this whole website that you can
[1:36:21.480 --> 1:36:27.040]  go to and it's it's kind of a diary of everything that's going on there right
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:31.800]  now or that you know kind of leading up to it and everything and it's their ads
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:36.720]  all over the internet and stuff like that and they call it hoping Hagan okay
[1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:41.080]  yeah so you do pronounce it Copenhagen but you're saying it's hoping Hagan does
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:44.600]  the earth have hope will we be able to tax you by the mile in your car with
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:48.560]  satellite tracker boxes as AP is reporting will we be able to tax the beef
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:53.000]  you eat in your house and federalize everything under UN control again the
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:57.400]  feds take over the states they take orders from the UN amazing hope and
[1:36:57.400 --> 1:37:02.400]  Hagan you know the hope thank you Kelly let's go ahead and talk to George in
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:08.000]  Texas George you're on the air go ahead can you hear me yes I can you know a
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:12.200]  thing as you hear about with the UN body and all that stuff I've been trying to
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:16.040]  hold a DV kid because I want documents that she got from the National Archives
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:20.880]  on the 17th Amendment and what she has told me so far is when this 17th
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:25.480]  Amendment was a prop was a proposed none of the states were really
[1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:29.280]  legislatures were in session this thing it's a fraud and yeah yeah let me let me
[1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:32.840]  break that down and I appreciate your call that's a long subject the 17th
[1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:38.440]  Amendment before the 17th Amendment state legislatures which we elect which
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:44.760]  come from our towns and counties they would then vote and appoint US senators
[1:37:44.760 --> 1:37:48.960]  so the states control the federal government under the 9th and 10th
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:54.720]  Amendment the 16th Amendment gave us the income tax that fun we didn't have an
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:59.400]  income tax until 1913 that was to meant to fund the private federal reserve and
[1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:03.720]  the federal reserve also didn't like states controlling the federal government
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:09.760]  as they're meant to so they also and yes I've had Bill Benson and many other
[1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:15.480]  historians on they went to all of the original 42 states at the time of
[1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:21.720]  ratification they did not ratify they did not even get close most the states
[1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:26.560]  weren't even in session the feds just lied and said it had been ratified so
[1:38:26.560 --> 1:38:31.840]  yes the 17th Amendment federalizing the states and the 16th Amendment giving you
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:35.360]  the income tax you know that you know the the media always says how would we
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:41.480]  fund the country if we didn't have the income tax well how did we build this
[1:38:41.480 --> 1:38:45.800]  country we have hundreds of other constitutional taxes as Ronald Reagan's
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:51.840]  Congressional Commission found in 1981 not one cent of your income tax goes
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:57.200]  around this country it goes to interest on the debt to the private banks that
[1:38:57.200 --> 1:39:01.960]  allow the government to issue currency the government under can under the
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:06.920]  Constitution Congress just issued the currency and credit they they set
[1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:11.720]  monetary policy until 1913 then a private group called the federal reserve
[1:39:11.720 --> 1:39:15.560]  what do you think the UN is it's a private group the IMF the World Bank the
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:20.560]  World Trade Organization this is private groups setting up and paying off
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:26.200]  governments to sign treaties with them you know the government can sign a
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:30.760]  treaty with David Rockefeller if they want to make him king of the world it's
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:36.440]  all it's all unconstitutional it's about to say something else let's go ahead and
[1:39:36.440 --> 1:39:41.560]  talk to Jim in New York Jim you're on the air go ahead
[1:39:41.680 --> 1:39:47.840]  hello come on Jim yeah go ahead yeah I didn't hear anything quick a comment and
[1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:54.760]  then a question for you last week you had G. Edward Griffin on and he spoke
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:39:59.320]  about maybe you posed a question to him about the after all these years his
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:04.120]  feelings on this subject matter and I really identified but not this a long
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:10.280]  time and my stomach gets sick like you know you read about it 20 30 years ago
[1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:14.840]  and you know what's happening but now it's here it's actually here and he
[1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:19.320]  expressed something around that order he said it was he said it was eerie for
[1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:24.680]  those who just joined it said it's like a river in Colorado and you and you know
[1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:29.480]  there's big waterfalls ahead you've got to get off the canoe but you haven't
[1:40:29.480 --> 1:40:34.160]  seen him yet and then now he comes around the bend there's Niagara Falls or
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:39.920]  you know whatever and it's yes after decades of being laughed at almost 50
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:44.760]  years 49 years now open world governments being announced go ahead
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:50.160]  anyway the question is that I started to go through your page today and I saw the
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:58.480]  article posted with Eston on the juice 20 summit yes you post all right he's
[1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:05.520]  saying that they they're gonna backwarp on this for a while well Eston Eston
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:10.000]  Eston just like Tucker does have some Bilderberg group contacts and I found
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:15.200]  his information is very accurate but the globalists have inner fishers you know
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:17.600]  they're not a hundred percent on the same team they're just going in the same
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:22.360]  direction just like a mafia groups you know may meet once a year but they
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:28.120]  still get in a fracas occasionally the G20 well he said two weeks ago the G20
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:30.440]  was planning to kill the dollar and they've announced that in the news so I
[1:41:30.440 --> 1:41:39.280]  don't know yeah all right you know Mark Murano was and Mary McElvaney
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:45.120]  McElvaney it rings a little bell well I saw them on the on a sea span with
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:50.320]  Markton and I'll tell you this guy Murano he might be worth you know if
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:55.360]  you if you're inclined to a true show have him on because the guy he tears
[1:41:55.360 --> 1:42:00.800]  them apart with humor wait a minute yeah he's the big runs one of the big
[1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:04.440]  sites dealing with climate change not being man-made yes that's correct we
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:10.560]  had him on yes I'm on but he would be good to get back on what he runs the
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:16.240]  climate depot I don't know what he was on the accuracy of the media to get

[1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:28.880]  call absolutely but in fact if we contacted us want to get him on okay

[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:16.560]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:20.440]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:24.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:28.920]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:33.240]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:36.920]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[1:46:36.920 --> 1:46:41.120]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:11.880]  Broadcasting Network network
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:21.720]  okay we had the bumper music faded down so that breaks snuck up on me I should be
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:25.320]  watching the clock better let's go back to Emily in Oregon Emily sorry you got
[1:47:25.320 --> 1:47:29.520]  cut off by the break go ahead that's fine I'm so glad to speak to you Alex I
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:34.720]  was a hopeless I've just started listening to you and I was a hopeless
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:41.600]  liberal you know and you blow my mind wide open and I'm just so grateful and
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:47.440]  I'm surrounded by all these liberals and there are huge you know now I look at
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:52.480]  the TV and I just see the intent I see how we were all so brainwashed I see it
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:58.360]  all so clearly you know and I feel like you're not reaching a huge group of
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:05.520]  people that need to be woken up i.e. us liberals and because you know I mean you
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:09.600]  can get through to the libertarians you can get through to those republicans
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:14.800]  but you're just they're just writing you off and I I so you know what I listen I
[1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:20.080]  pick apart everything you say and I try and put it into a context that I can
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:25.160]  show these people and you know these are people who listen to Keith they listen
[1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:32.160]  to John Stuart they listen to you know democracy now they mock Glenn Beck they
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:36.160]  they laugh at Fox well Emily let me let me break this down for you Glenn Beck
[1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:41.680]  and Hannity they're all meant to be mocked and you know the liberal mindset
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:45.040]  of the establishment liberal not the well-meaning liberal is it's about oh
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:51.040]  we're elite we're smart everyone else is dumb if you watch real time with Bill
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:56.880]  Maher it's how everyone's dumb but liberals and but they're not well go
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:49:02.480]  ahead and fade her back up voting late voting for republicans are just dumb but
[1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:07.280]  but these are a huge group of people that are so brainwashed I believe now from
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:10.640]  from me listening to you and looking at the television that they're getting the
[1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:16.120]  most scientific mind control yes yes they are brainwashed but but how does the
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:19.520]  establishment make Christians look stupid they focus in on the corrupt
[1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:25.000]  glitterbug preachers that are you know engaged in all this corruption it's the
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:29.720]  same thing how do they make libertarian or true free market look bad the same
[1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:34.480]  big banks that are robbing everyone label that as free market when it's not
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:40.040]  it's inside corruption it's piracy and the key to the fake liberal mindset is
[1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:44.880]  we're the elite we know best everybody else is dumb the thing is how are they
[1:49:44.880 --> 1:49:49.560]  making you you're about the only one out there I would say besides David Ike
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:54.800]  who's really telling it really telling it drumming it in how it is and it's how
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:50:00.160]  they're making you look stupid that's the point but I agree with you ma'am ma'am
[1:50:00.160 --> 1:50:05.000]  Wikipedia has my name spelled wrong they say I'm a right-wing extremist when I
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:09.520]  try to get people outside the left-right paradigm my main mission is to break the
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:14.240]  left-right division the establishment divides us along left and right so they
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:18.000]  can make the fight about left and right instead of about issues and Emily I
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:21.120]  really appreciate your call we could talk for hours call back during the
[1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:26.280]  weekday show I'm going to try to go to Troy Brian Annette and a few others but
[1:50:26.280 --> 1:50:34.720]  I promise to get to this flu news and then we'll do that but the issue here is
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:43.440]  that a Rush Limbaugh a Sean Hannity a Glenback cannot wake up a liberal they're
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:48.640]  not meant to they're meant to keep us in the left-right paradigm when Bush was in
[1:50:48.640 --> 1:50:53.240]  office the Democrats were right torture and war was wrong and big government was
[1:50:53.240 --> 1:50:57.600]  wrong but now that they're out of power torture and war and secret arrest and
[1:50:57.600 --> 1:51:00.880]  big governments good that's just because they're the party in power when
[1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:05.240]  Republicans are back in power in three four years seven years whatever the
[1:51:05.240 --> 1:51:08.960]  case may be whenever they retake the Congress the House and Senate and the
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:13.040]  presidency suddenly the Democrats will be anti-establishment they'll be against
[1:51:13.040 --> 1:51:16.880]  corruption and this is the bait-and-switch game but this is the
[1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:22.000]  radio show that has been able to deprogram people on the left and right we
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:25.480]  do have people on the left we do have people on the right that's why they
[1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:31.120]  have congressional reports FBI reports reports in salon reports in the New
[1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:35.360]  Republic saying I am the really dangerous one to the establishment
[1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:39.320]  because I'm the person really telling the truth so is Ron Paul he transcends
[1:51:39.320 --> 1:51:45.200]  left and right to a true populist grassroots constitutionalist view and
[1:51:45.200 --> 1:51:50.080]  that's why we're so dangerous to the New World Order is because we see the
[1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:55.680]  program we understand how they're controlling us okay I should have gotten
[1:51:55.680 --> 1:52:01.600]  to this earlier but I'll try to cover at the time we have left this is huge news
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:05.280]  everybody for three weeks has been asking me what's happening in Ukraine
[1:52:05.280 --> 1:52:09.680]  what's happening in Ukraine what's happening in Ukraine with massive deaths
[1:52:09.680 --> 1:52:16.000]  with some strange virus people are getting and reading in the British and
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:21.760]  Ukrainian English papers we are now discovering what's happening top
[1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:28.720]  scientists doctors are saying that this appears to be a mutation between the H1N1
[1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:33.760]  and the regular flu vaccines which they admit can mutate the virus and make it
[1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:38.280]  worse just like antibiotics can mutate bacteria to be worst where you can't
[1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:43.800]  kill them you know flesh-eating millions hit by plague worse than swine
[1:52:43.800 --> 1:52:49.320]  flu a deadly plague swept across Europe doctors fear after a outbreak of a
[1:52:49.320 --> 1:52:55.440]  virus in Ukraine plunged the country and its neighbors into a state of panic a
[1:52:55.440 --> 1:52:59.880]  cocktail of three flu viruses are reported to have mutated into a single
[1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:05.440]  pneumonia plague which is believed it may be far more dangerous than the swine
[1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:09.240]  flu the death toll has reached 189 and more than one million people have been
[1:53:09.240 --> 1:53:13.440]  infected most of them in nine regions of Western Ukraine the president of
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:16.480]  Ukraine is called the World Health Organization and a team of nine
[1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:22.320]  specialists that goes on now here's another article this is what the major
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:28.120]  papers in Ukraine and in Croatia and other Eastern European countries are
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:33.600]  saying scientists Nobel Prize winners one of the second biggest religious
[1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:39.280]  leaders in Croatia this is what they're saying Croatian priest says vaccine for
[1:53:39.280 --> 1:53:45.240]  destruction of humanity worldwide says it's a bio weapon now I don't know if
[1:53:45.240 --> 1:53:48.800]  that's the case but all these other scientists and doctors we had on the
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:55.200]  last 10 months 11 months since January I've been on air saying I believe these
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:59.360]  are on YouTube and Google and the audio files are all over the web you know just
[1:53:59.360 --> 1:54:04.880]  search the term Alex warned of flu before outbreak or I mean it's incredible
[1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:09.240]  in fact we ought to re-air some of those we found them and reposted them on
[1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:14.600]  info wars and prison planet and all we know is the feds in the US but also
[1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:18.080]  worldwide directed by the World Health Organization the UN is running this
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:23.480]  worldwide came into police departments and county sheriff's departments and
[1:54:23.480 --> 1:54:27.560]  said flu's gonna hit in the winter it's gonna kill millions get ready for
[1:54:27.560 --> 1:54:32.520]  martial law get ready for the citizens to attack you this is in January I had
[1:54:32.520 --> 1:54:36.680]  emergency managers on investigative reporters and I got secret documents out
[1:54:36.680 --> 1:54:39.560]  of upstate New York where they were saying get ready for millions dead this
[1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:45.160]  will happen in April I said it was all staged and that we were already at level
[1:54:45.160 --> 1:54:48.880]  six that came out three months later I got secret documents in Texas we
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:53.520]  posted them I mean we really know what we're talking about here folks we we do
[1:54:53.520 --> 1:54:59.280]  the research so long before any of this started I saw them getting ready for it
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:05.920]  and Horowitz and Dr. Sherry Tenpenny and all these other medical doctors we've
[1:55:05.920 --> 1:55:10.360]  had on have said they believe another super viruses coming that's gonna be
[1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:16.560]  released probably in Eastern Europe that is really what is gonna be deadly now
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:22.280]  it's beginning to happen I pray that they've been wrong I pray but you know
[1:55:22.280 --> 1:55:29.960]  why they picked Eastern Europe major flu vaccine manufacturers that we wrote
[1:55:29.960 --> 1:55:35.240]  articles about named last year and this year began doing secret trials with
[1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:39.720]  homeless people of bird and swine flu and other flu vaccines that were killing
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:45.480]  people admittedly and in Poland out of a hundred people that got tested on 21
[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:49.400]  died back Google that for folks that don't believe it right here at the end I
[1:55:49.400 --> 1:55:54.160]  have one minute left we can find it a headline bird flu homeless deaths
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:59.640]  London Telegraph it's also all over major doctors in the Czech Republic came
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:03.640]  out and said this is a attempt to release a bio weapon remember us in
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:10.080]  January and February and I was all over national radio talking about it but a
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:16.680]  profits not known in his own country as they say these companies were releasing
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:21.560]  flu trials that were actually spreading superfluous and killing people and it
[1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:25.360]  appears that's what that is on a separate issue there's the headline
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:29.360]  homeless people doctor bird flu vaccine trial in Poland they arrested the
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:34.200]  doctors that did it for a vaccine company but not the vaccine company on a
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:41.600]  separate issue look at these headlines this is MSNBC Virginia teen suffers
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:48.160]  rare illness after swine flu shot boy diagnosed with Gillian Barre syndrome to
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:56.280]  diet or Chinese H1N1 vaccine that's time magazine here's another one
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:01.880]  French woman gets crippling illness after H1N1 vaccine now remember what did
[1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:05.640]  they first give out two months ago the live and nasal flu virus which the
[1:57:05.640 --> 1:57:12.480]  insert not a conspiracy theory what comes with the insert said that it can
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:18.160]  mutate in the body and spread the flu it's a live virus it can spread I don't
[1:57:18.160 --> 1:57:22.800]  know what's going on folks but it's rigged and it's staged and it's scary
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:29.040]  this is medical tyranny as Ron Paul has said on this show even Dick army told
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:32.000]  the Dallas Morning News he believes they may be hyping this to pass national
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:36.440]  health care all I know is North commas in place the Pentagon says they may
[1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:40.080]  declare martial law that's mainstream news the banks are taking over the
[1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:46.120]  world government's being announced look out great job through today free
[1:57:46.120 --> 1:58:02.640]  transmission comes up later Jason Burmes is live on the other side
