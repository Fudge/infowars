[01:44.360 --> 01:49.720]  the Gaia theory now you may or may not be aware of what the Gaia theory is it's essentially the
[01:49.720 --> 01:54.960]  idea was taken from a Greek goddess that represented the earth it's the idea that the earth is a
[01:54.960 --> 02:03.480]  living organism and we essentially as humans are some kind of a virus and we need to be controlled
[02:03.480 --> 02:09.000]  or exterminated and the person who came up with that Gaia theory and one of the big proponents
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.760]  of global warming has backtracked on both of those things love lock and we're gonna be talking
[02:14.760 --> 02:20.760]  about an article about that very interesting and it really ties in with the Noah movie that came
[02:20.760 --> 02:28.080]  out this last weekend we've also got a South Carolina House of Representatives Trey Gowdy is
[02:28.080 --> 02:33.120]  threatening to hold the IRS commissioner in contempt because they won't turn over emails we've
[02:33.120 --> 02:39.800]  got secessionist in Europe that are turning out by the thousands and we have a big riot that took
[02:39.800 --> 02:46.360]  place in Albuquerque New Mexico yesterday you may remember Alex showed the video of a homeless
[02:46.360 --> 02:52.360]  man who was shocked in Albuquerque a very very disturbing video a lot of people disturbed by
[02:52.360 --> 02:59.960]  that and they had riots this weekend actually there were several hundred people that turned up
[02:59.960 --> 03:06.680]  they demonstrated for over 10 hours and it eventually got violent there so we're gonna
[03:06.680 --> 03:10.040]  show some footage of that we're gonna talk about what happened and we're gonna talk about what's
[03:10.040 --> 03:15.480]  going on behind the scenes at the Albuquerque police department some of the things that you may or
[03:15.480 --> 03:21.480]  may not know about them it's kind of a poster child for the shoot first ask questions later
[03:21.480 --> 03:27.160]  mentality that's being fostered by the federal government in our local police departments and
[03:27.160 --> 03:32.760]  so we're gonna talk about that I want to take some of your calls see what you think is the
[03:32.760 --> 03:38.280]  reasonable thing to do to try to get control of our police departments what do we do to stop this
[03:38.840 --> 03:44.680]  the Albuquerque police department has a murder rate that's higher they've killed more people
[03:44.680 --> 03:50.440]  than New York City and they got a murder rate that's four times the national average and of
[03:50.440 --> 03:57.080]  course have been paying out tens of millions of dollars in lawsuits so what do we do as a community
[03:57.080 --> 04:02.200]  how do we get control of the police when they're out of control when they never are held accountable
[04:02.200 --> 04:08.120]  for what they do no matter how egregious it is when they can murder people on videotape and get away
[04:08.120 --> 04:15.160]  with it is that a solution to compensate the victims at the expense of the taxpayers or is
[04:15.160 --> 04:20.360]  there maybe a better solution I've got some ideas I want to hear your ideas we're going to be taking
[04:20.360 --> 04:29.640]  your calls at 800-259-9231 but I want to know what you think about what we can do to pull back
[04:29.640 --> 04:34.520]  these police that are not being held accountable they've got unions that support them they got
[04:34.520 --> 04:40.600]  police chiefs who never see that they do anything wrong how do we stop this or like the Liberals
[04:40.600 --> 04:46.360]  do we just give them a monopoly on force Barack Obama was in Belgium and he's talking about the
[04:46.360 --> 04:50.680]  UN arms trade treaty we're going to have more news about that as well a lot of breaking news

[08:08.200 --> 08:19.160]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[08:23.400 --> 08:27.880]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night i'll be your host today taking your calls and
[08:27.880 --> 08:35.480]  going over news now today is monday march 31st 2014 that was a deadline for obama care but
[08:35.480 --> 08:41.000]  like groundhog day it seems to be repeating the same problems we've seen over and over again
[08:41.000 --> 08:47.080]  we've got the website going down for six hours on the deadline morning but of course they extended
[08:47.080 --> 08:52.120]  this deadline we've seen that before too haven't we we've seen over 30 times that obama has
[08:52.120 --> 08:58.360]  unilaterally changed obama care evidently it's kind of like every time uh it starts to roll
[08:58.360 --> 09:02.520]  around with another deadline it's kind of like he sees the shadow instead of a groundhog he sees
[09:02.520 --> 09:07.480]  a shadow of voter disapproval and uh he extends it you know just like the groundhog uh lets us
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.880]  know if we're going to have some more winter or not that's the same sort of thing that's going on
[09:11.880 --> 09:18.200]  with obama and the new york times points out that there's repercussions and reprieves at the health
[09:18.200 --> 09:23.960]  insurance enrollment deadline yeah we got a lot of reprieves and repercussions you know the power
[09:23.960 --> 09:30.760]  to tax is the power to destroy and when the supreme court said that it was a tax and that's
[09:30.760 --> 09:36.760]  another interesting story you know we see i think it's the only time that the chief justice of
[09:36.760 --> 09:42.920]  supreme court has written both the assenting decision and the dissenting decision he wrote
[09:42.920 --> 09:46.440]  both of them because he changed his mind at the last minute remember everybody was saying
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.840]  that it was going to lose it was a five four and it was going to be struck down as an illegal
[09:52.840 --> 09:59.400]  mandate and at the very last minute chief justice roberts who had written the opinion striking it
[09:59.400 --> 10:05.400]  down changed his mind interesting you know this is before we learned about all the nsa spying and
[10:05.400 --> 10:09.400]  a lot of us believe that they had something on him i still believe that's the case i mean we've
[10:09.400 --> 10:14.040]  seen that with betray us and others i still believe that they blackmailed him to write
[10:14.040 --> 10:19.640]  both sides of that opinion but they call it a tax and a tax is a power to destroy and so
[10:19.640 --> 10:24.760]  when it gets to the point where obama's friends are going to be affected by it he gives them a
[10:24.760 --> 10:31.560]  reprieve if it's something that concerns people and he sees the election coming up but he gives
[10:31.560 --> 10:36.760]  them a reprieve as well because he doesn't want the people who don't really understand how this
[10:36.760 --> 10:43.400]  is going to destroy them he wants a reprieve for that until after the election because it's going
[10:43.400 --> 10:48.040]  to be very damaging for them anyway now one of the things in this article from the new york times
[10:48.040 --> 10:52.280]  i thought was kind of interesting they had some faqs frequently asked questions and one of them
[10:52.280 --> 10:57.400]  is uh what changes or delays might be expected in the coming years it says the experience of the
[10:57.400 --> 11:02.600]  last four years strongly suggests that there will be more surprises yeah they definitely will
[11:03.480 --> 11:09.640]  and another story here from uh this is cbs it says on the eve of obama care deadline the law
[11:09.640 --> 11:16.280]  remains a work in progress actually you know it's not a law it's a series now of executive orders
[11:16.280 --> 11:23.160]  where obama can just come in and change it however he wishes but when a senator was asked about this
[11:23.160 --> 11:29.480]  on the fox news program this is senator angus king an independent senator from main who caucuses
[11:29.480 --> 11:36.680]  with the democrats he said uh when chris wallace asked him about obama care he said uh there is no
[11:36.680 --> 11:43.560]  such thing as obama care there you go doesn't exist so we passed it we're finding out what's in it
[11:43.560 --> 11:48.200]  but actually according to him it doesn't exist and i guess in one sense it really doesn't exist
[11:48.200 --> 11:54.120]  because there is no care being provided for anybody this is nothing other than an insurance
[11:54.120 --> 11:58.680]  mandate it is not health care health insurance is not the same as health care just the same
[11:58.680 --> 12:04.440]  as a school a government school any school is not the same as education we need to understand
[12:04.440 --> 12:10.680]  there's a difference between the way we do these things and sometimes they're counterproductive to
[12:10.680 --> 12:15.240]  the goals that we want if we want health care maybe the way to do it is not have the insurance
[12:15.240 --> 12:23.400]  companies write something that transfers wealth from americans to the one percent to the health
[12:23.400 --> 12:31.400]  care industry they're the ones who wrote this now there's another article here from cbs and it says
[12:31.400 --> 12:35.960]  that charges are likely to be dropped against volunteers who are signing people up for obama
[12:35.960 --> 12:43.400]  care that's right chicago police detained a couple of men who are going door to door scamming elderly
[12:43.400 --> 12:48.600]  residents uh it turns out that wasn't actually a scam it was obama care they were selling well
[12:48.600 --> 12:54.440]  actually it was a scam but they're gonna let them go uh he said i would have never thought
[12:54.440 --> 12:58.920]  that informing people about obama care would get me in handcuffs i thought i was doing something
[12:58.920 --> 13:03.640]  positive for the community and what they did was they charged them with soliciting an unlawful
[13:03.640 --> 13:10.600]  business i think that's the best way to describe obama care i've ever seen an unlawful business
[13:11.160 --> 13:16.360]  i think these obama care for voters are soliciting an unlawful business i think the chicago police
[13:16.360 --> 13:20.520]  got it exactly right that's right these are a couple of guys who are community organizers
[13:21.080 --> 13:25.880]  and then we have this breaking news about obama care in california this is on the drudge report
[13:26.600 --> 13:33.240]  california obama care sends out voter registration cards that are already pre marked democrat
[13:33.240 --> 13:39.800]  and see it's simply about politics it's not about health care it's about controlling you
[13:39.800 --> 13:44.920]  making you think you're going to get something at somebody else's expense that's what it's always
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.360]  been about that's why people sign up for but look at this story coming out of california play this
[13:50.360 --> 13:55.800]  report all the couple who received this letter and voter registration card from covered california
[13:55.800 --> 14:00.040]  has lived in la mesa for years and they've always been registered to vote republicans tonight
[14:00.040 --> 14:06.280]  they're perplexed as to how this voter registration card pre marked democrat ended up in their mailbox
[14:06.840 --> 14:12.040]  as you can see playing his day the box next to the words democratic party is penned with a black
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.960]  x on this voter registration card it was sent to a la mesa couple who did not want their identity
[14:17.960 --> 14:23.320]  revealed sent from their health care provider covered california the state run agency that
[14:23.320 --> 14:29.000]  implements president obama's affordable care act i mean i'm an old guy and i never would have noticed
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.480]  it except i have an accountant that noticed every dot and dash on a piece of paper as a wife
[14:33.480 --> 14:39.480]  covered california began mailing out voter signup cards to nearly four milgen enrollees last week
[14:39.480 --> 14:45.080]  after being threatened with a lawsuit by voting rights groups but that doesn't explain this
[14:45.080 --> 14:48.920]  it's a waste of money because there's an awful lot of people are going to get this that are already
[14:48.920 --> 14:55.160]  registered they don't need to but it's like i can see that but i can't see putting an x on the form
[14:55.160 --> 15:00.520]  before it's before it's given me in a little bitty box that nobody's really going to notice we
[15:00.520 --> 15:06.120]  shared what was sent with covered california company spokeswoman and gunzala stated we are
[15:06.120 --> 15:12.120]  mailing voter registration material however the application forms come directly from the secretary
[15:12.120 --> 15:18.360]  of state's office with no fields pre marked the individual should contact the secretary of state
[15:18.360 --> 15:23.720]  which takes these violations of election law extremely seriously and they will investigate
[15:23.720 --> 15:27.880]  using the unique serial number and the couple says they did reach out to the secretary of
[15:27.880 --> 15:31.960]  state's office and couldn't get a hold of anyone also reached out to the san diego register our
[15:31.960 --> 15:38.280]  voters which told them to contact covered california preston phillips ten yeah who would have thought
[15:38.280 --> 15:42.040]  who would have thought that this would have been used for political purposes it's just
[15:42.040 --> 15:48.200]  so surprising isn't it actually that's been the purpose all along it's been to benefit the democrat
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.400]  party demagoguing trying to profit on the idea that you're going to get something at the expense
[15:53.400 --> 15:59.960]  of your neighbor at the same time they can reward their corporate backers you know obama spent over
[15:59.960 --> 16:05.240]  a billion dollars to get elected this last time do you think he had some people that he needed to
[16:05.240 --> 16:11.160]  pay off when you look at the explosion and what we're spending on just the presidential race
[16:11.800 --> 16:17.080]  it's very evident that there is graft and corruption you know as i think uh i forget who it was it
[16:17.080 --> 16:23.560]  said it but an election is an advanced auction of stolen goods and that's exactly what we're seeing
[16:23.560 --> 16:29.080]  with obama care and people wonder why they're getting their hours cut wonder why they're not
[16:29.080 --> 16:34.280]  getting pay raises wonder why they're getting put on part time basis even a small part time
[16:34.280 --> 16:41.640]  basis because they've redefined work down from full time is being 40 hours to 30 hours so you've
[16:41.640 --> 16:46.920]  got these poor people that are especially down at the bottom of the scale in order to get an
[16:46.920 --> 16:53.000]  insurance coverage that probably doesn't address their needs a cat-like policy that is going to
[16:53.000 --> 17:00.040]  require people like single males to get maternity coverage that's the sort of thing that is costing
[17:00.040 --> 17:04.920]  people so much money in obama care that's what we're talking about when we say that this is a
[17:04.920 --> 17:09.400]  massive transfer of wealth from the american public to the insurance companies forcing us to get
[17:09.400 --> 17:15.880]  insurance that we don't need paying much higher prices than we need and they're wondering many
[17:15.880 --> 17:21.320]  people are wondering why they're not getting these jobs these raises why they're layoffs in the
[17:21.320 --> 17:28.360]  businesses they don't understand how this comes back around now we've also seen some good news
[17:28.360 --> 17:34.520]  in the last few days we've seen that trey gowdy and this is someone who is a congressman republican
[17:34.520 --> 17:40.280]  congressman from south carolina is threatening to hold the irs commissioner in contempt for
[17:40.280 --> 17:47.800]  withholding the learner emails regarding persecution of tea party organizations irs commissioner john
[17:47.800 --> 17:53.880]  cuskin in is being threatened with contempt of court unless he produces the irs official
[17:53.880 --> 17:59.480]  lowest learners emails by the end of this week and what he says is all we want are emails to or from
[17:59.480 --> 18:04.440]  lowest learner i'm not talking about private taxpayer information and and this is the key
[18:04.440 --> 18:09.720]  thing that he says right here one of the reasons they don't answer our subpoenas is they don't
[18:09.720 --> 18:16.120]  fear any consequences yes that's what's happening in government whether you're talking about irs
[18:16.120 --> 18:21.960]  agents or bureaucracies or you're talking about out of control police departments in albuquerque

[19:16.120 --> 19:21.800]  unaccountable all the way up to the irs commissioner this is a 72 year old who was bitten on the arm
[19:21.800 --> 19:27.240]  as he worked in his yard this is in orlando florida he said when i got to the corner of the house the
[19:27.240 --> 19:33.560]  dog leapt at me and he wasn't so angry about the dog that bit him causing his arm to bleed but he
[19:33.560 --> 19:38.600]  said it was the officers handling of the situation he told me to go inside even though i was bleeding
[19:38.600 --> 19:43.240]  he's supposed to have control the dog he's not supposed to just let that dog wonder where people
[19:43.240 --> 19:49.320]  are but see doesn't even get an apology doesn't get control of that these are the police and the

[24:08.120 --> 24:23.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we've got a lot of colors that want to
[24:23.000 --> 24:28.920]  talk to us about what's going on in albuquerque and i think in general about the police to bring
[24:28.920 --> 24:33.400]  you up to date is what happened yesterday there were riots at the end of the day that actually
[24:33.400 --> 24:40.520]  started out as a peaceful protest in albuquerque uh it was put forward by anonymous who said that
[24:40.520 --> 24:45.560]  we're tired of this let them know that your city is not a place for war games against the homeless
[24:45.560 --> 24:52.440]  and the less fortunate now this is in response to the shooting the death of homeless man james
[24:52.440 --> 24:58.520]  void he was illegally camping out in the hills of albuquerque he was confronted by the police
[24:58.520 --> 25:05.480]  and he's a homeless guy he's not necessarily all together there but he did absolutely nothing
[25:06.280 --> 25:10.600]  that would threaten these police they're at a distance they've got guns drawn on him they've
[25:10.600 --> 25:16.120]  got a dog they stick the dog on him it was absolutely disgusting i we've had it up at
[25:16.840 --> 25:23.160]  info wars the entire video was up there not the edited mainstream media version of the video
[25:23.160 --> 25:28.600]  look at the entire video how they shoot this guy when he's got his hands up and he turns
[25:28.600 --> 25:33.640]  with his back to them after he's telling them okay i'm gonna leave just as we talked about
[25:33.640 --> 25:39.160]  don't do anything and they shoot him in the back then they stick the dog on him then they come over
[25:39.160 --> 25:45.800]  and step on him the guy's not dead yet he did eventually die outrageous what they did and of
[25:45.800 --> 25:51.240]  course the immediate response so the police chief is no problem this is a police department
[25:51.240 --> 25:57.400]  that since 2010 has had 37 shootings 23 of them fatal they've had more shootings than the new
[25:57.400 --> 26:02.920]  york police department even though new york city is 16 times larger they've had something like four
[26:02.920 --> 26:08.120]  times a national average in terms of shootings the justice department was already investigating
[26:08.120 --> 26:13.080]  them before this happened so there was a lot of there was a riot this week i keep calling it a
[26:13.080 --> 26:19.000]  riot it ended in a riot it was actually a protest went on for 10 hours over 500 people now that's the
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.120]  media's estimate of it i'm sure it was much more than that after it got down to about a hundred
[26:24.120 --> 26:30.840]  people that was when things got violent now there's a if you want to see the pictures of the people
[26:30.840 --> 26:36.920]  involved daily the daily mail uh is always good about pictures you can see the picture of the man
[26:36.920 --> 26:43.320]  that was murdered you can see the killers the two cops who are basically being exonerated by the
[26:43.320 --> 26:49.240]  police department and then of course you can also see some pictures of the riots there they say
[26:49.240 --> 26:53.240]  that as night fell and they got down to about a hundred people that's when the police started
[26:53.240 --> 26:57.640]  using tear gas on the group and making arrests they say that it got out of hand it got violent
[26:58.600 --> 27:04.440]  but this is how the daily mail you can look at the pictures there but when they describe the
[27:04.440 --> 27:10.680]  situation they say the officers were attempting to affect a felony arrest using less than lethal
[27:10.680 --> 27:16.760]  weapons including a destructive device a canine and a taser shotgun that's what the police chief
[27:16.760 --> 27:25.080]  said that is not true i don't think that illegal camping is a felony arrest but if you shoot somebody
[27:25.640 --> 27:30.200]  if you're a civilian it's only justified if that person is coming at you if somebody breaks into
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.960]  your home and is coming at you you are entitled to protect yourself to shoot them but if that person
[27:35.960 --> 27:41.880]  is running away from you whether you're tv under his arm or your computer or whatever under his arm
[27:41.880 --> 27:49.240]  and he's no longer a threat to you and you shoot him in the back that's murder that's what the police
[27:49.240 --> 27:55.080]  did they were not being threatened by this guy now they say in the daily mail that authorities
[27:55.080 --> 28:00.280]  said that he threatened to kill a crisis intervention team officer who was called to the scene and
[28:00.280 --> 28:05.800]  that the video footage shows an injured boy with two five inch knives in his hands when officers
[28:05.800 --> 28:11.720]  surround and handcuffed him i didn't see that in the video you take a look at the video you take
[28:11.720 --> 28:16.200]  a look and see if you see that i'd like for you to see if you can see any knives in the guy's hand
[28:16.200 --> 28:21.880]  because i guarantee you if you watch that video you are going to be outraged and you should be
[28:21.880 --> 28:27.240]  and so the question is what do we do about out of control police do we as citizens just pay the
[28:27.240 --> 28:33.320]  bill to their families after they kill people and hope that it isn't us hope that it isn't
[28:33.320 --> 28:39.320]  our family but we just pay for the lawsuits that are now like up to 24 million i think and
[28:39.880 --> 28:45.880]  in albuquerque for the unjustified deaths of these people is that our response or do we
[28:45.880 --> 28:50.360]  take some other kind of action let's go to kyle in pennsylvania kyle what do you think about this
[28:51.320 --> 28:55.720]  hi mr night and i think everything that you said is spot on and i have to preference
[28:55.720 --> 29:02.600]  that everything i say by saying that's not all police are like this but i think the main issue
[29:02.600 --> 29:08.360]  is that the police have a certain feeling of separation from the population and they feel
[29:08.360 --> 29:14.600]  that they are somehow entitled to a different set of laws and they don't what do you think that
[29:14.600 --> 29:19.800]  comes from what do you think that separation that entitlement is coming from well i mean i'm sure
[29:19.800 --> 29:24.680]  that you know in the academy they're taught that you know every time you go out on the street your
[29:24.680 --> 29:31.160]  life is in danger and you know stranger danger bad guy could be working around every corner
[29:31.160 --> 29:36.360]  and that every mom with a stroller could have a bomb in there well yeah actually they put out
[29:36.360 --> 29:41.240]  no hesitation targets homeland security that it's coming from the federal government kyle
[29:41.800 --> 29:45.480]  that's the people that are putting this out they're militarizing the police they're telling them
[29:45.480 --> 29:49.480]  that we're a threat to them we're going to be right back hang on kyle pick up on the other side

[33:06.840 --> 33:10.200]  homeland security begins with hometown security
[33:15.080 --> 33:21.720]  it seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets which may make scarring particularly
[33:21.720 --> 33:31.080]  difficult even with this year's rule changes to recap those revisions women are still worth 10
[33:31.080 --> 33:39.160]  points more than men at all age brackets but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers

[34:14.280 --> 34:19.400]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and i was just talking to kyle and pennsylvania
[34:19.400 --> 34:24.680]  about the out of control police in albuquerque and the response of the people there we had a
[34:24.680 --> 34:28.760]  protester who was quoted as saying that he was fed up with how the police are treating citizens
[34:28.760 --> 34:34.520]  there it's reached a boiling point he said and people can't take it anymore over 500 people
[34:34.520 --> 34:39.880]  showed up for more than a 10 hour protest they want the police chief to be fired the police
[34:39.880 --> 34:44.040]  department there even before this last shooting was under investigation from the department of
[34:44.040 --> 34:50.120]  justice because there have been so many shootings there so many more than the average so many more
[34:50.120 --> 34:55.640]  than even new york city which has 16 times the number of people there so there's clearly
[34:55.640 --> 35:00.360]  something wrong the taxpayers are getting hit with tens of millions of dollars in judgments
[35:00.360 --> 35:06.520]  in albuquerque what do we as citizens do about it and kyle you were saying that there's
[35:07.160 --> 35:11.880]  there's good police officers out there there certainly are and as we've done a report over
[35:11.880 --> 35:19.960]  and over again in albuquerque and in new mexico those good police officers get put out we had
[35:19.960 --> 35:24.680]  a report as albuquerque police are trained to shoot first take a look at that that was something
[35:24.680 --> 35:29.640]  that we did for the nightly news it's now up on the alex jones channel it talks about this very
[35:29.640 --> 35:36.920]  department and it also talks about a chief of police in a small town shane harger who on his
[35:36.920 --> 35:43.320]  way to a constitutional share of some peace officers association meeting was harassed by the tsa
[35:43.320 --> 35:49.160]  and the video that i've seen from the events he was very respectful but you know there's
[35:49.160 --> 35:55.880]  a breaking point for anybody when you get when you get accosted by the tsa unconstitutionally
[35:55.880 --> 36:01.960]  over and over again and he was threatened and he had his entire small town police force disbanded
[36:01.960 --> 36:07.320]  and he was fired ultimately first he was put on suspension and then he was fired and when i
[36:07.320 --> 36:14.600]  did an investigation of this i found that the local television station was trying to demonize
[36:14.600 --> 36:20.280]  him for having two ids saying that was why he was being hassled by the tsa and there was
[36:20.280 --> 36:26.040]  implying that there was something shady about that the reason the guy had two ids was because
[36:26.040 --> 36:33.800]  of a suspected homicide by an albuquerque police officer and he was first on the scene and he
[36:33.800 --> 36:39.240]  would not change his story and as a result there's a lot of things that happen to that he was in
[36:39.240 --> 36:42.760]  fear of his life i suggest you take a look at that i'm not going to go into the entire report
[36:42.760 --> 36:48.280]  it's a very interesting story but what happens is there are good cops and they get pushed out by
[36:48.280 --> 36:54.760]  the corrupt cops and that's a great example of what happened in that story very sad story to see
[36:54.760 --> 36:59.240]  that happen to him and i don't know what the current resolution of that is i don't know if he is
[36:59.240 --> 37:05.240]  suing to get reinstated but uh kyle did you want to say something else kyle i mean there's a certain
[37:05.240 --> 37:12.120]  code of conduct that we as a society have you know uniformly decided there's a certain way
[37:12.120 --> 37:18.360]  a police officer should behave and we need to realize that once an officer starts acting
[37:18.360 --> 37:26.680]  outside of that code of conduct he's no longer an officer he's a civilian general population so if
[37:26.680 --> 37:33.320]  a police officer shoots a clearly troubled person who's illegally camping in the woods
[37:33.320 --> 37:39.720]  for no reason he doesn't get to be tried as a police officer who shot a man in the wood
[37:39.720 --> 37:44.760]  he needs to be tried as a murderer and he needs to be tried just like anybody else
[37:44.760 --> 37:51.480]  who would shoot an unarmed innocent man um you know and that's for the riot in albuquerque
[37:51.480 --> 37:58.680]  i'm sorry but 90 percent of our communication is not verbal so when the police show up dress
[37:58.680 --> 38:05.000]  like stormtroopers in in armor and shields yes with gear gas what do you communicate
[38:05.000 --> 38:11.640]  you're communicating violence you're saying okay we're going to be a rumble here one way or another
[38:11.640 --> 38:17.320]  that's right they're escalating you're you're breaking up an excellent point when they show up
[38:17.320 --> 38:23.080]  it is a confrontation it is always a confrontation and they are itching to get violent because they
[38:23.080 --> 38:30.520]  have been trained by homeland security that you are the enemy they want to they're militarized
[38:30.520 --> 38:37.240]  in the police they are looking at the american streets as a battlefield that's what the ndaa is
[38:37.240 --> 38:41.960]  about they're assuming they're making the assumption that it's a battlefield and so you've got the police
[38:41.960 --> 38:46.760]  being militarized you've got the military being used as police let's go to uh josh and georgia
[38:46.760 --> 38:50.760]  thank you kyle josh and georgia wanted to say something about the situation in albuquerque
[38:50.760 --> 38:55.800]  or police in general yes and i apologize i've got you on speakerphone here i want to read
[38:55.800 --> 39:02.280]  something if you don't mind okay go ahead uh citizen quote citizens may resist unlawful arrest
[39:02.280 --> 39:08.600]  to the point of taking and arresting officers life if necessary plumber versus state 136 indiana dot
[39:08.600 --> 39:14.360]  306 this premise was upheld by the supreme supreme court of the united states in the case john badl
[39:14.360 --> 39:21.640]  b us 177 us 529 the court stated where the officer has killed in the course of the disorder which
[39:21.640 --> 39:27.000]  naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted the law looks very differently uh with
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.400]  with very different eyes upon the transaction when the officer had the right to make the arrest
[39:31.400 --> 39:36.120]  from what it does at the officer officer have no right but maybe murder in the first case
[39:36.120 --> 39:40.920]  might not be anything more than manslaughter in the other where the facts might show that no offense
[39:40.920 --> 39:46.840]  has been committed at all uh another quote uh an arrest yeah well i i i absolutely understand
[39:46.840 --> 39:53.080]  and i absolutely agree that we all have an inherent right of self-defense and when the police or any
[39:53.080 --> 39:57.960]  other government official gets outside of the bounds of their lawful authority what they've
[39:57.960 --> 40:03.480]  taken an oath to they no longer have that authority if you disobey the constitution if you disobey
[40:03.480 --> 40:09.320]  your oath you're out of line of your authority you're no longer a lawful authority but i want to see
[40:09.320 --> 40:14.520]  this taken care of in a way that doesn't come down to us fighting it out in the streets with
[40:14.520 --> 40:20.440]  the police because quite frankly you can defend yourself against the cop but they will kill you
[40:20.440 --> 40:26.680]  if the things don't change the way they currently are so how do we as a society take this back there
[40:26.680 --> 40:33.000]  has to be some kind of that the mayor's the city council and of course the people that are in there
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.960]  are not doing it now we have to get people elected at the local level and right now the local level
[40:38.680 --> 40:43.560]  is really where we have the best chance of an election elections are very rigged at the national
[40:43.560 --> 40:48.040]  level especially the presidential level you know whoever is counting the votes is going to determine
[40:48.040 --> 40:52.440]  the election and they've got a lot of different ways they can rig the election but at the local level
[40:52.440 --> 40:58.920]  we have a better chance of having honest elections we need to get people who are going to stand up
[40:58.920 --> 41:04.280]  in my opinion and are going to say they're going to be penal they're going to be penalties not just
[41:04.280 --> 41:09.320]  for the taxpayer when the police overstep this there's going to be consequences and penalties
[41:09.320 --> 41:14.200]  financial judgments if they can't convict these people because the police unions are so strong
[41:14.200 --> 41:20.920]  at least they can say that you as a police officer are going to be liable for these these damages
[41:20.920 --> 41:27.560]  in an unlawful death case and then anything over and above what you're able to supply and those
[41:27.560 --> 41:32.200]  judgments is going to be taken out of the budget of the police department let's say let's start
[41:32.200 --> 41:37.080]  trying to do some things like that to try to get them under control the biggest part of the problem
[41:37.080 --> 41:44.920]  is as Kyle was talking about we have a a due process and yet they they're not treated they
[41:44.920 --> 41:48.600]  should be treated just as an ordinary criminal if they kill someone but they're not treated that
[41:48.600 --> 41:54.680]  way they get special treatment as an officer they're not even questioned in the same way if you go
[41:54.680 --> 41:59.880]  back and you look at the rules that the police unions have put in the officers are not even
[41:59.880 --> 42:04.600]  questioned as criminal suspects in the same way that you or I would be questioned josh did you
[42:04.600 --> 42:11.000]  want to say anything else yes well to to curb it is you know people need to start standing up
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.560]  right i've i've said you know if the first amendment is the voice the second amendment is
[42:15.560 --> 42:20.840]  teeth the fourth amendment is the brain and if we don't start standing up for for any of them
[42:20.840 --> 42:26.760]  we're we're not going to have any of them and the we've we've turned into a society of watchers
[42:26.760 --> 42:30.680]  if we see something and we know that it's wrong we pull out our phones or we pull out
[42:30.680 --> 42:36.120]  our cameras and we video it but we don't help and those people are still even even people
[42:36.120 --> 42:41.800]  that come to the rescue and come to the aid of someone being illegally detained are you know
[42:41.800 --> 42:49.080]  allowed to yeah and until we actually start standing up and saying no and doing something
[42:49.080 --> 42:57.160]  and drawing a line in the sand and saying no more and and i understand and following through
[42:57.160 --> 43:01.320]  with it it's going to continue to happen i understand you know there's a lot that you've
[43:01.320 --> 43:05.800]  heard the thing before about the different boxes of power that we have we got the jury box we've
[43:05.800 --> 43:11.400]  got the cartridge box we've got the ballot box actually we've got the soap box as well but you
[43:11.400 --> 43:17.640]  know i think that we need to try to use the ballot box as much as we can because once we get to the
[43:17.640 --> 43:23.320]  cartridge box we're going to be going up against their strength in many ways because it's kind of
[43:23.880 --> 43:28.920]  kind of going to be like uh when the revolutionary war was going on they didn't win too many battles
[43:28.920 --> 43:34.280]  when they just lined up and fought the british on their own terms you know getting in a straight
[43:34.280 --> 43:39.880]  line and shooting each other they won when they were pursuing asymmetric warfare and of course you
[43:39.880 --> 43:48.200]  could even say that about a a cartridge box situation but let's try to get control of the state and the
[43:48.920 --> 43:54.360]  local city governments if we can get control of that and then get control of the police i think
[43:54.360 --> 44:00.360]  that would be the way to resolve this hopefully jerry and thank you uh uh let's go to jerry and
[44:00.360 --> 44:07.480]  georgia jerry hi david um thank you for taking my call i wanted to make a point about what's on
[44:07.480 --> 44:14.040]  the top of drudge the internal homeland security document it ties into all this and in the fact
[44:14.040 --> 44:19.400]  that we're treated like criminals just uh you got a guy who's down on his luck he's camping out and
[44:19.400 --> 44:24.040]  he's treated like a criminal they swat team him but if you look at the internal homeland security
[44:24.040 --> 44:32.120]  document 68 000 convicted illegal alien criminals were released caught and released yeah if you
[44:32.120 --> 44:38.040]  872 000 whose visas have run out and have been ordered to leave the country or just floating
[44:38.040 --> 44:45.320]  around have never left and they say that they're surveilling us for our safety but these people
[44:45.320 --> 44:52.200]  are just floating around they they wiretap us they take they all our phone records metadata us
[44:52.200 --> 44:59.640]  for our safety but these people are just floating around oh yeah absolutely and and as far as the
[44:59.640 --> 45:07.320]  albuquerque if you watch the video he was murdered they they had non-lethal they had the beanbag
[45:07.320 --> 45:12.840]  shotgun the dog and looked at and then the gun and what did they use the order they used to this
[45:12.840 --> 45:17.320]  they shot him with the gun first then while he's laying there bleeding out they shoot him with
[45:17.320 --> 45:22.440]  the beanbag and attack him with the dog yes yes as opposed to uh shooting him with a beanbag if
[45:22.440 --> 45:28.360]  he resisted attacking him with the dog and then the final option if they're if they're threatened
[45:28.360 --> 45:33.880]  and fearing for their lives just use the gun so well if you want to solve it you bring the
[45:33.880 --> 45:38.680]  man up on murder charges the cop who needs to go up on murder charges there was there was clearly
[45:38.680 --> 45:45.640]  no justification for lethal force at all there but the thing that is really really gut-wrenching
[45:46.200 --> 45:50.920]  is how they tortured the man as you point out they stick the dog on him after they shot him he's
[45:50.920 --> 45:56.520]  he's been shot he's bleeding out and they stick a dog on him and then they step on him and it's
[45:56.520 --> 46:02.120]  you just have to see this folks because we have to get control of our government we have to get
[46:02.120 --> 46:07.560]  control of them especially at the local level at the police the federal government is hyping these
[46:07.560 --> 46:14.520]  guys up militarizing them teaching them that we are the enemy we are the civilians they're using
[46:14.520 --> 46:19.240]  the same kind of tactics the same kind of terminology that they would for an occupying
[46:19.240 --> 46:24.200]  force in a foreign government and of course the founding fathers always warned us that the means
[46:24.200 --> 46:30.200]  of defense abroad would become the means of tyranny at home with a standing army and we
[46:30.200 --> 46:35.880]  have a standing army here we have not only a standing military army that has been in place for
[46:35.880 --> 46:42.120]  60 years since the end of world war two constantly at war we have a standing army here at home the
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.880]  militarized police and the police being used increasingly as military thank you jerry let's
[46:47.880 --> 46:56.120]  go to patrick and michigan patrick hey david how you doing fine what you got thanks for holding
[46:56.120 --> 47:02.360]  on the court well alex is hopefully i'll get some rest uh like you said he did last week uh i used
[47:02.360 --> 47:07.160]  to live in key west florida patrick i think you're on a patrick i think you're on a speakerphone can
[47:07.160 --> 47:14.280]  you pick up the phone because we're getting a lot of echo um let me try this yeah if anybody's on
[47:14.280 --> 47:18.920]  a speakerphone let's try to get these yeah let's uh we'll come back to you patrick let's go to uh aj
[47:18.920 --> 47:29.720]  in ohio aj yeah hi david how you doing um you know you talked about uh you know trey galdy uh saying
[47:29.720 --> 47:36.200]  that there's no accountability so i think what we should do is uh see i it all goes back to this
[47:36.200 --> 47:42.040]  morning uh blaze put up a uh a quick video this morning that i watched uh and it actually made
[47:42.040 --> 47:47.800]  me sick because uh they were showing the riots but it was before the riots actually broke out
[47:47.800 --> 47:54.440]  and there was a girl uh probably 110 pound girl or so uh was crossing the street mining her own
[47:54.440 --> 48:00.520]  business she didn't say anything or do anything and this cop the line sided this girl like you
[48:00.520 --> 48:05.160]  know he was some kind of linebacker something like that into a bench and he had no reason or no
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.880]  justification to do such a thing and and i don't know about you but i was raised to not strike a
[48:09.880 --> 48:16.200]  woman you know and to see that absolutely made me sick so that's why i didn't believe these reports
[48:16.200 --> 48:20.280]  that were being put out by the Daily Mail and others because when they started the way they
[48:20.280 --> 48:26.360]  represented the shooting was totally not what happened and so when they started representing
[48:26.360 --> 48:32.040]  the fact that these that the riots started when the protesters got violent i didn't believe that
[48:32.040 --> 48:37.160]  either because i think they started when the protesters got to a size that the police were
[48:37.160 --> 48:42.200]  comfortable attacking them we've seen that happen when we went to the when we went to the open carry
[48:42.200 --> 48:46.600]  rally in san antonio and there was a thousand people there with rifles and they didn't know
[48:46.600 --> 48:51.240]  which ones were loaded which ones weren't the police were very well behaved but as soon as
[48:51.240 --> 48:55.160]  pretty much everybody left and there was just a couple of people there they started harassing
[48:55.160 --> 49:00.360]  those people who were left behind anything else you want to say uh patrick i'm sorry aj
[49:00.360 --> 49:07.080]  um that's okay um yeah um i think that right there was an instigation for them to try to
[49:07.080 --> 49:11.080]  start because every man's instinct is defend a woman when he sees her you know being hurt
[49:11.640 --> 49:17.400]  so here's what i think we need to do uh the info warriors are a powerful force i think we need to
[49:17.400 --> 49:24.440]  get off the couch and we need to send letters to the state representative and and uh you know
[49:24.440 --> 49:29.960]  in that state and say hey look what you're going to lose your job because it's an election year
[49:29.960 --> 49:36.040]  unless you hold that chief accountable because honestly an organization is defined by its leaders
[49:36.040 --> 49:40.680]  so i think we need to all take a half an hour out of our day and write letters in demand
[49:40.680 --> 49:46.120]  accountability or we will do everything we can to take that person's job away from them absolutely
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.440]  good point you know in that report that video report that i did uh the albuquerque police trained
[49:50.440 --> 49:55.640]  to shoot first in spite of all this that's going on this this is the place where they had the cop
[49:55.640 --> 50:01.080]  who shot up the van full of kids remember that from last fall remember where they stopped the guy the
[50:01.080 --> 50:07.400]  guy had a stop sign violation they pulled him over they took him in gave him eight anal probes
[50:07.400 --> 50:13.800]  build him for it that's all new mexico the shooting in the van was new mexico the police chief who was
[50:13.800 --> 50:19.240]  fired was in new mexico the good police chief uh because they're not going to fire somebody who
[50:19.240 --> 50:26.840]  stands up for them bullying people but uh the response of the state was to change the curriculum
[50:26.840 --> 50:33.240]  at their police academy to a shoot first curriculum and one of the instructors there was so upset
[50:33.240 --> 50:39.080]  about that that he refused to teach it so they fired him see if you're a good cop they get you
[50:39.080 --> 50:44.200]  out of the system in new mexico and that's what we're seeing happening in other places it's not
[50:44.200 --> 50:47.720]  just in mexico but it's the worst there right now that's where we need to fight it we're going to be
[50:47.720 --> 50:51.960]  back right after the break we're going to take some more of your calls and talk about uh what's
[50:51.960 --> 50:57.560]  going on in new mexico and your solutions for what the police should do and how we control them stay
[50:57.560 --> 51:05.160]  tuned the response has been overwhelming and for that we say thank you hi i'm daniel one of the

[53:04.440 --> 53:09.800]  patriots over at my patriot supply several years ago matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[53:09.800 --> 53:13.880]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlington's willing to sell us
[53:13.880 --> 53:19.480]  out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born

[55:40.040 --> 55:44.440]  yesterday and could shed some light on what happened because these demonstrations that were
[55:44.440 --> 55:49.560]  going on at first it was at least 500 people that's what the media reported they typically
[55:50.440 --> 55:55.880]  under report those numbers as it dwindled down to a hundred we just had a caller say that he saw
[55:55.880 --> 56:02.920]  video footage that the police shoved a young lady things deteriorated the police are saying that it
[56:02.920 --> 56:08.760]  was when protesters got violent that they got violent but of course they show up in full riot
[56:08.760 --> 56:16.680]  gear in a confrontation and are in people's faces people are already upset and angry about
[56:16.680 --> 56:23.960]  what was clearly the murder of an innocent man there was not any excuse there was no reason
[56:23.960 --> 56:29.320]  for these officers to feel like they were threatened by this guy he had his back to them he was
[56:29.320 --> 56:35.400]  walking away and he was telling them as he was putting on his backpack it's okay everything's fine
[56:35.400 --> 56:41.080]  as we talked about and then they just shoot him and stick the dog on him as he's dying
[56:41.080 --> 56:45.880]  we've got a couple people who are already on the line uh kelly in texas did you want to talk about
[56:45.880 --> 56:54.840]  this hello yes kelly go ahead david hi yes i want to um i want to talk to you about some
[56:54.840 --> 57:01.960]  aviation activities that we've been witnessing um increased over the last couple weeks i live in
[57:01.960 --> 57:12.120]  new bruntles so i am in near san antonio we live near randolph in blackland but um we saw a couple
[57:12.120 --> 57:24.840]  of days ago two un um marked ac 130 followed by four osprey i have been saying the osprey were
[57:24.840 --> 57:35.480]  in the lead um and then we are building south of san antonio and have seen um loaded f16
[57:36.680 --> 57:43.320]  so what's your uh what's your take on this because we saw we had a video on the info wars site about
[57:43.320 --> 57:49.240]  a large um surveillance might look like uh it sealed windows that sort of thing doing loops
[57:49.240 --> 57:55.000]  right around the austin airport here and of course that was happening uh about a year ago
[57:55.000 --> 58:00.440]  downtown austin doing very very low flights so uh what's your take on it what do you think's going
[58:00.440 --> 58:06.680]  on well my take on it and i definitely encompass those what you're speaking of today with the police
[58:06.680 --> 58:16.200]  militarization i think is a symptom of we are seeing um the desperation of the oligarchy i really
[58:16.200 --> 58:21.880]  think they know that their days are numbered well it's it's getting it's intensifying that's for sure
[58:22.440 --> 58:28.120]  and we've got a new report today up on info wars thank you very much kelly we got a report

[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we've been talking about the situation
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:33.720]  in albuquerque the demonstrations and subsequent riot that happened and we had a caller earlier
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:38.680]  tell us that he saw a video where a young lady was shoved by the police that was a different
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:44.920]  riot that was the riot in arizona where the people were rioting because their sports team
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:50.360]  didn't win uh still not an appropriate response from the police but that was not the albuquerque
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.280]  riot just want to correct that also had another crew member suggests we're looking at solutions
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:59.480]  how do we get the police under control i had a crew member step in here and say we need to look
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:06.520]  at the grand jury laws in new mexico is there a way that they can bypass the official grand jury
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:12.600]  that is essentially in the control of those who are in power who are not doing anything who are
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:20.840]  just content to pass on the lawsuits to the taxpayer and as i reported earlier in new mexico
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:27.240]  they have changed the police academy training to a shoot first curriculum in spite of all these
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:32.600]  shootings in spite of all this abuse and they had a police academy instructors say that he was he
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:38.200]  would refuse to teach that curriculum because it was a shoot first curriculum he was subsequently
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:43.960]  let go let's go to jim in north carolina he says he thinks he has some solutions to this jim
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:49.880]  what are your solutions well my my solution is pretty simple is that a group of people need
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:56.280]  when they protest to be prepared to go to jail once they're inside the jail don't make bond go ahead
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:01.080]  and fight the thing all the way to trial you're going to lose the trial appeal it you got to
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:09.000]  create a paper record to where the state agencies are properly you know know that you that you're
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.640]  having problems with police um if you don't if you don't fight the cops physically you can't you
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:22.040]  know uh what's your argument going to be mm-hmm yeah it's it's going to take some people to
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.520]  essentially lay down a significant portion of their life you know that's the only way that
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:33.320]  anything ever changes isn't it we either spend some time or some money or a huge hunk of our life
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:39.080]  to try to change things but it's a worthy way to try to go about things we we'd ask for somebody
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:44.440]  in new mexico to call in thank you very much jim uh we've got brian into mexico brian do you have
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:51.560]  any first-hand knowledge of the demonstrations yesterday hello hello brian into mexico do you
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:58.360]  have any yes sorry about that yes um yeah i'm calling from albuquerque uh it's kind of crazy
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:04.760]  almost feels like a pressure cooker where you know it's just building up um my relationship to it
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:10.680]  so i used to produce a public access television show when the new mayor came in he basically took
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:16.680]  it upon himself to give control of the station to another group so as part of that there's a lot
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.640]  of corruption and stuff with that but as part of it i attended several city council meetings in
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:28.040]  order to speak on keeping the public access the way it was and i was amazed by how many times
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.000]  every time i went to city council there would be dozens of people with signs saying that they're
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.040]  you know a family member had been killed by a police officer and it made me feel really petty
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:44.440]  um arguing for a television show when i'm sitting next to a three-year-old girl whose father had been
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.400]  killed by the police so i started doing some research and this was about a year and a half ago
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:56.600]  and when i did of all the thousands of cities and towns in this country albuquerque was in the top 10
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.040]  of per capita shootings of police of its own citizens um it was either number six or number
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:09.400]  five as i recall uh and it just really kind of awakened me to how bad this problem was
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:15.240]  and we're paying out millions of dollars tax money and all that stuff i think the biggest problem
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:21.720]  part of it is the culture but i think a lot of it too is the federalized grants last night
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.720]  there were um armored trucks there there were riot squads there were SWAT teams there were police
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:33.640]  from other cities in their armored vehicles and it just seemed like the response was way
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:39.640]  above and beyond anything that you know it demanded for it and i know you know there was
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:44.920]  a warning with um anonymous saying that they were going to bring down the apd computers and that
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.760]  they were asked hang on we've got to go to break i want to come back to you got a firsthand report
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.960]  out of new mexico it is absolutely amazing but that's what they've been training for that's what
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:59.480]  they've been itching for is a fight with the people of america on american streets we'll be right back

[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.640]  talking to brian from new mexico a caller who called in with some firsthand knowledge of
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:23.080]  what's going on in albuquerque and of course yesterday there were protests which eventually
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:29.240]  became violent after about 10 hours people are very upset about the record of shootings by the
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:35.880]  albuquerque police and it is above normal for the country but it is something that i believe that we
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:39.880]  have pointed out over and over again here at info wars is something that's being driven
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:46.840]  from the federal government militarization of the police the confrontational attitude of the police
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:53.000]  and as they've instituted in new mexico a shoot first training regimen at the police academy
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.720]  this is how this is going to break down it's not just going to be a homeless man who's shot
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:05.880]  they're going to come into your home look at new york this is a story out of police state usa dot
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:13.400]  com that broke over the weekend this is westbury new york and they now have a task force a police
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:19.080]  task force that is going to have zero tolerance housing enforcement program well what does that
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:24.600]  mean well that means that homeowners in the long island community of westbury about 15 000 people
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.920]  have had their private property rights a bridge to the point where they will no longer even be able
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:34.920]  to make autonomous decisions about what happens inside their homes cops will sweep through communities
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:41.640]  and conduct housing inspections without notice a presentation given at a town hall meeting included
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:47.160]  a prop that explained the changes the poster included the following statement quote modify
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:55.480]  search warrant law to eliminate prior notice there we go and aggressively use warrants and housing
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:02.760]  sweeps on a regular basis slash done exclamation mark that's what they're going to do they're
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:08.440]  going to have zero tolerance in your house if they think that you've got somebody that is
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:14.600]  illegally renting in your home whatever that means they are going to just come in without a
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.600]  search warrant without any private notice they're going to use SWAT teams on people's individual
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:24.600]  homes if they just suspect you this is the real danger of the police and the surveillance state
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.160]  when they start having all these cameras everywhere they start profiling people perhaps
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.800]  turn it over to some artificial intelligence and they see somebody maybe you've got a flat tire
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:39.480]  and so you're kind of hanging around next to a car which happens to be your car they don't know that
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:45.560]  and then after a while you duck down and they think that there is a burglary going on and
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:50.440]  they report that or the AI program reports that to the police and they show up and you
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:56.040]  stand up with a tie arm tie iron in your in your hand are they going to shoot you thinking that
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:02.280]  you've got a weapon I mean that's more than this guy in Albuquerque had if they can shoot homeless
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:08.840]  people for illegally camping can they bust into your home in New York in Westbury New York without
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:16.040]  a warrant without anything other than believing that they're enforcing a zero tolerance program
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:21.400]  can they just bust in and if you don't know who's coming in they don't identify themselves properly
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:26.360]  because you know they like to do these no knock raids that's the favorite method of the SWAT
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:32.680]  teams if you try to defend yourself you get shot that's where we're headed that's why we have
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:39.560]  search warrants that's why we didn't have SWAT teams for a couple hundred years but now it's
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:46.120]  out of control and it's getting worse we should have zero tolerance for this kind of activity
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.560]  from our government we need to do something about that we're just talking to brian into
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.840]  mexico brian i wanted you to continue with what you saw their first hand in albuquerque
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.400]  um the biggest thing was the tear gas uh long term ago i was in the military and i
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:10.600]  hadn't experienced that since then and uh it's it's just out of control and i guess the main thing
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.960]  is you know i'm talking with people what can be done because you know in a way a protest demonstration
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:19.960]  is invigorating it shows that there's come commodity between you know other people that
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:27.080]  feel the same but at the end of the day if there's no justice it doesn't really change anything and
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:33.080]  that's the biggest thing that the system seems to be so corrupt both locally and then as you
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:39.000]  go up further and further the feds just recently repainted a lot of the local police cars and they
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.440]  used to have a slogan on the side saying and step with the community um that slogan is now missing
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:49.960]  and it's just a little thing but it just shows how we are getting further and further away from
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:56.200]  the principles that this country was founded on um your your your thing about you know new york
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.440]  where they can come to your home because you have somebody they don't like in your living room
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:05.800]  is just outrageous and or because they think you may have somebody that they don't like somebody
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:11.080]  that you maybe didn't file the proper permits for pay the proper taxes for so they just come in with
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:17.080]  a no knock swat team raid no search warrant in my personal space if somebody was homeless for
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:22.760]  example um and i said you can sleep on my couch till you get back on your feet you know does that
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:28.280]  make me now a criminal because i'm eating in a bedding you know illegal campers but the whole
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.080]  thing is just off and it sounds like it's you know being facetious or over the top but the
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:40.360]  situation right now is over the top and i unless there's justice i really don't see a solution
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:45.000]  you know i'm not saying that these police that did that should be going to jail or whatever
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.280]  but they should be having a trial there should be some legitimate you know right away the police
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:55.000]  chief you know the new police chief because the other one would constantly support the you know
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.960]  his troops a hundred percent um he was finally got rid of we've had a new police chief for about
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:05.880]  two months let me stop you right there you just said he would support his troops see you understand
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.680]  that this is a militarization don't you we distinctly understand that they've been talking if you go
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.400]  back and look at movies going back to the 70s ready the police even then we're talking about
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:22.600]  civilians versus a cop or whatever but that has really been doubled down that's no longer
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.840]  anything other than occupied territory the way the police are operating you understand
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:33.400]  instinctively that they're troops aren't they and and then by you just look at them yesterday
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:38.680]  with their i mean they look like a cross between Darth Vader and Nazis with their SS helmets and
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:47.800]  all their weapons and armored vehicles it's just it is so militaristic that it it's it staggers the
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:54.280]  mind i guess that's the hardest thing is people just can't grasp the magnitude or how deep down
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:00.360]  this rabbit hole we've already allowed herself to go and that is it it is we've allowed it to
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:05.880]  happen you know people are just so hung up doing their jobs paying the bills watching the kids
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:11.240]  that they really don't take time unless something happens to you directly to see what's going on
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:16.360]  with your neighbor or your community i agree this situation is kind of forcing a lot of people really
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:22.200]  to take a look at where we happen to be in the crossroads that we're at well thank you brian
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:28.200]  into mexico that's what we're seeing everywhere you know at south by southwest jacari jackson
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:33.480]  went down there was following some reports and he was part of an open carry rally that he was
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:38.760]  covering and he talked to a guy who was essentially pushing back against that and jacari said aren't
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:45.080]  you concerned that the police would have a monopoly on force as part of the conversation and the guy
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:50.120]  said well i can see where that would be a problem in nazi germany but this is america it can't happen
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:56.920]  here it's an information problem people don't understand what the real danger is they don't
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:02.920]  really perceive the issue now brian into mexico saw this situation yesterday where they had a
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:08.760]  demonstration about the shooting of a homeless man he just described how they look like a cross
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:15.000]  between darth vader and nazis and how they showed up completely militarized he just in the course of
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.280]  talking about he talked about how they were troops it's really an information war the good news is
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:25.800]  is that we can win that we've had some really good news this week i think in terms of the
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:32.040]  information war we've got mike rogers announcing that he is going to be retiring that he's going
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:38.680]  to be leaving congress we've also had keith alexander who's been the head of the nsa for quite a period
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:44.920]  of time also stepping down why is it that these guys are leaving i think it's because they have
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.000]  such low credibility that they could tell people that the sky is blue and nobody would believe them
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.560]  anymore they've got to get some different people in there and they're hoping that if they do they're
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.200]  going to have some more credibility but you know what they're not just changing the face there is
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.200]  not going to give them more credibility now a couple of things are going on with mike rogers
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:08.040]  and we had a breaking story here that kurt nemo had an info wars house intel boss says that putin
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:13.640]  is looking to invade eastern europe meanwhile multiple sources say there's no sign of russian
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:20.120]  military buildup that's kind of par for the course for mike rogers always pushing for war always
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:26.920]  pushing for the surveillance state never having any justification for either says here points out in
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.800]  the article rogers made the claim despite a complete lack of evidence that's exactly what we see with
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:41.080]  the rest of his claims about war and we also see that there was a an article from now as he's leaving
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:47.880]  for and not standing for reelection the question is is he leaving because he can't win or is he
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.680]  leaving because they've got a bigger task for him i think that the answer is both actually there was
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:58.360]  a story that was on political wire and when they reported that he was leaving they said that his
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:04.360]  district is currently rated as a safe republican district by the raffenberg political report but
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:08.520]  without rogers it could be competitive because mit romney carried the district by only three points
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:17.560]  in 2012 obama won it by six points in 2008 you know what i don't think he would win after he's been
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:22.920]  the the poster child for the surveillance state for the last year after the snowden leaks he's the one
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:29.000]  pushing back constantly he's the one making jokes about killing snowden see when somebody exposes
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:35.560]  criminal activity whether it's the united states or whether it's turkey then they attack the whistleblower
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.920]  who is exposing the criminal activity in turkey when the criminal activity was exposed we had
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:46.200]  the head of intelligence the head of the military political heads talking and actively plotting about
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:53.400]  how they're going to stage a false flag attack against a tomb of a sula man Shah that is claimed
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:59.000]  to be turkish territory that is being guarded by turkish soldiers so that they could start a war
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.960]  with syria when that's exposed they shut down youtube and the mass media only talks about
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:11.480]  the fact that youtube is shut down but and then parrot the lines from the government from the
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.680]  turkish government that the people who expose this are villainous and dishonest no the people who are
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:21.560]  villainous and dishonest are the ones who are plotting to kill their own countrymen in order to
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:27.560]  start a war with another country and that's the same kind of attitude we've seen from mike rogers
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:33.720]  and the cheerleaders for the nsa they attack snowden they attack the people who are exposing
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:39.160]  the criminal activity and quite frankly i don't think he could get reelected again but he's going
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:44.280]  to try to do an operation mockingbird they're losing the information war they say they have no
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.280]  credibility and so they're trying to put some people in those positions we're going to be
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.960]  right back we're going to talk a little bit more about this as well as taking your calls

[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:22.920]  about the demonstrations in albuquerque that turned violent this last weekend after they shot
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:27.320]  that homeless man and if you haven't seen that video if you haven't seen alex jones
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:33.640]  seeing that video for the first time you need to see that video now we're talking about how
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:38.840]  they've militarized the police it's something we talk about here frequently at info wars because
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:44.680]  it is a very serious problem there was an article that just came out at the new american said why
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.160]  is homeland security paying to put cities under surveillance and they point out the Santa Monica
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:54.280]  police department received nearly eight hundred thousand dollars from dhs that's the homeland
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:59.400]  security department just days ago in march 28th this is what they're going to use the money for
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:03.320]  funds were requested to purchase equipment and training that supports regional homeland security
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:09.720]  goals specifically an automated license plate reading system for the police department terrorism
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:16.840]  liaison officer training hazardous material training and equipment urban search and rescue
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:22.760]  yeah they're going to rescue you all right this is this is police state stuff guys and they're
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:28.760]  talking about how ineffective these cameras everywhere have been the article points out that
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:34.600]  in houston citizens of houston should overlook their elected leaders acceptance of such federal
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:42.280]  largesse given that the 900 or so surveillance cameras already in place have had no favorable
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:49.800]  effect on the crime rate in the city and the local cbs affiliate kho u says officials say
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:55.720]  data is not being kept to determine if the cameras are driving down crime and the article
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:01.960]  in new american asks if the cameras aren't being used to reduce crime then what are they being used
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:09.480]  for that's right they are not there to protect you folks we're looking to create a maximum security
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:17.960]  state a maximum security state is a maximum security prison and that's what is being created here
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:25.160]  with our tax money you know people will often ask uh are we headed for brave new world or we headed
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:33.800]  for a 1984 orwell society what does our society look like more of one novel or more of the other
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:40.520]  novel we got two dystopian pictures of society of course in 1984 orwell's version of it it was an
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:46.200]  iron fist as i think he put it it was a boot stamping in somebody's face forever big brother
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:52.520]  watching everything you do this gray dark world but of course all this huxley gave us a view of
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:59.080]  the brave new world and in his view it was all fun and games it was sexualizing the children at
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:05.480]  an early age it was destroying the family it was overwhelming people with pleasure so which is it
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:12.280]  we certainly see both elements in our society in my opinion i think we've got both going on
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:18.840]  but at different levels you know in 1984 the people who were not at the let's say middle
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:23.880]  class or above were pretty much left alone that they pretty much left the pros alone the proletariat
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:29.560]  they ignored them i think those are the people who basically opt out of the system who are just
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.920]  content to be entertained with games and television those are the people that they're using the brave
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:40.520]  new world tactics on i think the people who are in the middle class in the working class and above
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:45.960]  especially people who are a part of the government bureaucracy they're getting the brave new world
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:52.280]  treatment that's where the police state kicks in anybody that may be a threat to their power base
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:57.960]  is going to get the 1984 treatment if you're content to just set back and be entertained to
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:04.760]  death you get the brave new world we've got some callers who've been on the phone telling us about
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:10.360]  what they think might be solutions to the police state let's go to joseph in texas joseph
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:18.920]  hello yes go ahead joseph in texas okay well um you know first i asked a few things i wanted to say
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:24.920]  but uh i've been listening you know and um i i live in the dallas and um you know i've actually
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:29.000]  looked at getting for law enforcement myself i'm a young guy and um i have a lot of friends of
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.480]  mind are in the sheriff's department in uh my local area you know and a lot of these guys
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:37.000]  talking about this stuff and they're like a hundred percent you know aware of it or even more so
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.440]  than you expect they're like they're totally you know against it but the thing that surprises me
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.800]  is that they kind of they kind of uh have that too you know there's nothing they can even do about
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:54.120]  it this kind of stuff you know and so but the kind of solution that i think that you know people
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:59.480]  that uh everyone i talk to i always try to instill in people is um is the fact that it's like it's
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:03.560]  a personal responsibility that the fact that when you talk to people they just you know they
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:08.520]  turn around they they give they give if they put forth the attitude that it's just that's the way
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:13.720]  it is not the way it's going to be and then there's no resistance even just like you know talking
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:19.000]  about what they're okay with the police having you know all over in the world but you know that's
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.800]  that's a good point and i i think really the way out of this is the way that we see from organizations
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:28.840]  like oathkeepers and the constitutional sheriff's and peace officers association these kind of officers
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:34.120]  who see the danger and understand where this leads they need to understand they are not alone this is
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:40.040]  the way that it ended in east germany when the guards refuse to shoot people who are going over
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.800]  the fence thank you joes if we're gonna be right back and we're gonna take some more of your calls

[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:30.040]  it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night we've been talking about the
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:36.680]  police state about the surveillance state and how they're losing the info war still very powerful
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:44.200]  on the streets still treating citizens as targets but how do we roll this back well i think
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:48.680]  the key thing is that people need to understand on a broader basis what's really at stake here
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:53.240]  people in albuquerque understand because it has gotten to such a bad degree there will people in
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.640]  other areas of the country understand what the federal government is doing as it pushes the
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:03.960]  militarization of the police as it wants to use the military as police now there was an
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:09.400]  interesting thing that happened in belgium this last week where obama was asked a question
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:13.240]  about the surveillance state but before we go to that clip i want you to hear that clip
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:18.840]  but we've seen mike rogers the cheerleader for the police state as head of the house
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:23.400]  intelligence committee we've seen him say that he's no longer going to run for office he's going
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:31.480]  to step down and go into talk radio why because i don't think he can win there this is a republican
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:36.440]  district that they've carved out in michigan but it's always been close going two or three
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:41.960]  points one way or the other in the presidential elections and i think for the last year he has
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:48.280]  been the spokesperson for the nsa i think he has totally lost his credibility just last week
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:55.080]  mike rogers and dutch ruppersberger he's a democrat from maryland introduced from the
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:01.880]  house intelligence committee a bill that they called end bulk collection act end the bulk
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:08.120]  collection act well as we always see from these congressional bills it does exactly the opposite
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:14.280]  thing it doesn't end bulk collection it makes provision for how the data is going to be bulk
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:20.680]  collected and who's going to store it all they're doing is moving it from their servers essentially
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:30.680]  to the servers of their corporate entities that they partner with so here he has absolutely no
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:36.440]  credibility keith alexander is leaving the nsa they're trying to put a different face on it
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:44.760]  because look at how obama was received in belgium people they're very concerned probably even more
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:49.640]  so than americans are about how they're being surveilled and so they had a questioner ask him
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:57.400]  about the surveillance state and obama gives us rambling answer and there is absolutely no applause
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:02.280]  at the end even though the guy who comes up and takes over kind of tells people you know
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:07.800]  that's it that's all the questions hit hit uh now's the time for applause they had everything
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:13.160]  except an applause sign but they couldn't get anything just the sound of one man clapping
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:21.160]  listen to this checks balances legal processes the good news is that i'm very confident that it
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:28.200]  can be achieved and i'm also confident that the core values that america has always believed in
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:39.240]  in terms of privacy rule of law uh individual rights uh that that has guided uh the united
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:46.360]  states for for many years and will continue to guide us into the future thank you very much
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:53.640]  everybody thank you again one person starts to clap and stops the last question thank you very
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:58.840]  much for coming that was the last question ask your chance you need to applaud he's kind of
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:04.840]  awkwardly walking off the way he is exiting is the same way the keith alexander is exiting
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:10.920]  the same way that mike rogers is exiting nobody believes it anymore we were told last summer
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:18.120]  that we saw a meeting of the defense department public relations and we had a young lady stand
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:23.800]  up and said nobody believes us anymore it's just mindless propaganda absolutely they keep telling
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:29.080]  us that it's just metadata and it doesn't matter people need to wake up to that aspect of it
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:36.440]  here's an article that was on our website how the nsa can use metadata to predict your personality
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:40.280]  and the person who put forward this study said we see a lot of comments along the lines of
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:46.200]  it's only metadata it's not personal and it only gets personal when a human looks into it
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:51.560]  we wanted to show an example at a small scale of what you might be able to do with that data
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:56.840]  on just things like how long a call lasts when the calls are made where the calls are made and
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:02.360]  what they did was they took the standard personality types that psychologists would come up with
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:06.520]  neurotic open extroverted agreeable conscientious those different types of things and they just
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:12.440]  looked at simple things like basic phone use the number of calls active user behavior like the
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:16.440]  time it took for the subject to answer a call simple things like that location the regularity
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:21.560]  of their calling routine and they were able to pretty accurately much better than just random
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:27.560]  they were able to profile people see they can predict where you're going to be in the next 24
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:34.360]  hours looking at your metadata just as accurately or more accurately than you can in many ways the
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:39.880]  metadata is more intrusive than just listening to your phone call or reading your email they can
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:45.000]  actually glean a lot more from that so people need to wake up i think people are waking up
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.880]  you see the re the frosty reception that obama got you see these guys are having to leave they
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:56.840]  cannot allow mike rogers to stand for reelection and lose that would be a huge black eye to the
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:02.680]  security state but guess what mike you've already lost we've got your number and i can't wait until
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:07.000]  he gets on the air and people start calling him that's going to be that's going to be some good
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.560]  radio that might actually give him a boost in his ratings one other thing on the police day before
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.760]  we get back to uh callers here this is something that came out of the washington post and it was
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:21.560]  an article we talked about it briefly yesterday was uh france kafka meets the national security
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:28.680]  agency and of course kafka loved to write stories about the mindless unresponsive bureaucracy
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:34.760]  stonewalling people here's a guy who was trying to get information about his father who'd been
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:42.200]  a syndicated columnist and he was illegally wiretapped by the cia in 1963 a very very long
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:48.200]  time ago this information should now be declassified he tried to get information from the nsa he tried
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:52.840]  to get it from the cia nobody's going to talk to him he actually was able to get some information
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:58.440]  from the fbi but what i thought was the most interesting thing was the response from the nsa
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.800]  this is from their chief of staff of the freedom of information act privacy appeal authority
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:07.400]  and she says as a result of my review i've concluded that the appropriate response is to
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.280]  continue to neither confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of any intelligent material on
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:18.360]  your father to do so when challenged under the foya act would result in the exposure of intelligence
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:23.160]  information sources and methods which could harm our national security and severely undermine
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:29.720]  nsa activities in general this is something that happened 50 years ago when they were looking at a
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:35.560]  journalist and i'm sure it would tell us things about the nsa that we already know really but
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:39.960]  what i thought was most interesting about this was that this person was chief of staff they've
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:46.600]  got an entire crew of bureaucrats in their foya department who don't give any information out
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:51.800]  that's where the kafka comes in they've got an entire staff she's got people working for her
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.040]  and they're going to if they're going to not give information about a journalist who is tapped
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:01.560]  60 in 63 50 years ago if they're not going to give information out about him they're not going to
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:07.960]  give any information about anybody but she's got an entire staff that she's chief of this is the kind
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:14.440]  of bloated police state bureaucracy that is out of control that is both stupid and offensive
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:19.960]  and dangerous at the same time this is what we're currently seeing this is what we have to fight
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:24.920]  we're winning in many respects but there's a lot still to be done especially with people
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:29.160]  not understanding what's going on with militarization of the police as we pointed out
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:34.760]  the two billion bullets the armored personnel carriers that homeland security is getting
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:38.120]  people these are the things we're very concerned about let's take a couple more calls on this
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:44.040]  subject jerry in ohio you've been on for a long time how you doing dave you're fine thanks for
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:50.760]  holding go ahead um yeah i just wanted to make a couple quick comments here uh in northeast
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:58.280]  ohio here the uh they're really trying to get the public to embrace this uh this mafia police state
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:06.200]  they're even going into these churches and forming anti-violence church programs where
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:12.440]  if you see something uh you know you're to watch and to tell see something say something yeah
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:20.520]  they're really boosting that to get everybody to spy on everybody up here and with all the cameras
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:26.200]  and all the uh you know they got the streets all laid out in grids so jerry i find that so disturbing
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:31.080]  because you know the way things got rolled back in east germany was when people they were shooting
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:35.240]  people who were trying to escape trying to get over the wall they had guards who were shooting
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:40.600]  people you know the way that stopped that stopped when people met at churches and had a silent
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:49.320]  vigil in mass they started walking to protect to protest that and the police and the the guards at
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:56.040]  the uh at the gates there in east germany stood down but it was led by the by the churches and the
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:01.960]  churches are the ones who have a lot of moral authority who could try to get people to organize
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:06.600]  against the wholesale slaughter of people against the escalating violence but instead as you point
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:12.440]  out so many of them are becoming quizlings for the state spying on their fellow citizens go ahead
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:19.480]  and also you know they're uh like if you go to a festival or like a demolition derby or something
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:27.000]  you know you see these storm troopers uh standing around watching everybody and uh you know people
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:33.080]  are just getting so accustomed up here in northeast ohio to seeing these military helicopters going
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:40.440]  over uh we're seeing drones up here uh you know they bring out their military in the parades and
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:47.480]  people just clap and you know and go crazy for them and and they they'll sit like an army tank
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:53.720]  or a jeep or with machine guns out in the middle of a parking lot at a school where kids can go
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:44:00.040]  out and climb on it and oh it's so wonderful you know that our military has these weapons to defend
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.360]  us what are they going to think when they when they start rolling down our streets and they have
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:10.840]  Chinese and Mexican troops in them yeah and they're telling people to go back home or they'll be uh killed
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:16.360]  well you know it's sad as you mentioned every time we have a public event anymore it seems like it
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:21.800]  as they start driving down the streets and they're militarized vehicles it's starting to look more and
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:28.040]  more like a mayday parade and communist uh russia or china isn't it you know where they portray their
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:35.000]  military might in our face all the time but uh but yeah they're going into the churches up here
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.240]  and they're telling people if you see something or you're not sure about something call the police
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:48.200]  i mean that that is really getting uh down to where uh uh people have no rights up here at all
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:54.680]  they they have township people that if you build a little thing to put mulch in they'll drive around
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:45:00.120]  they'll take pictures of it and take pictures of your house and they'll report you and then they'll
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:05.560]  come out to try to raise your taxes like you're doing home improvement oh yeah i mean it's like
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:11.080]  communist china here yes yes it is no respect for private property just as i pointed out earlier
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:16.760]  in uh westbury new york they are going to basically have zero tolerance if they think that you've got
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:22.440]  somebody in your home staying with you that you haven't okayed with them uh they're assuming
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:26.440]  that they've got the authority to tell you who you can and cannot have in your private home
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.120]  they're going to swat team you without a search warrant and they're very proud of that
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:35.800]  thank you jerry let's go to uh josh in washington josh thank you for holding i've been on for quite
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:42.600]  a while yeah hey david thanks for having me on i'm a former military security and asset protection
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:49.160]  specialist from marine corps and in that training that we got we were extensively trained in the
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:55.960]  application of legal force and the core of that training is something called the escalation of
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:03.800]  force and it's basically a common sense approach to handling confrontation if someone is standing
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:11.720]  there with their fists no weapon you can't you can't just shoot them yeah if someone is standing
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:17.800]  there with a knife you can't shoot them in the head yes right you you can't even really take
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:23.240]  these steps to immobilize them without using non-lethal steps first i watched the video in its
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:31.000]  entirety it was a murder it was clearly a murder there was no no application of the escalation
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:38.280]  of force this is the first i've heard on the program today of any kind of shoot first policy
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:45.000]  which completely goes against anything that i was trained which every training i've had
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:51.800]  in regards to the application of lethal force there was the inherent you honored human life
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:57.960]  yes regardless of what was happening you didn't just you didn't honor your life first you honored
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:04.280]  human life i've seen people i've seen people comment and say that everybody knows a retired
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:10.680]  police officer who says that it was considered a failure if you drew your weapon it was a you
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:16.040]  had failed to deescalate this situation that's exactly what you're talking about but what we're
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:22.680]  seeing in new mexico and in other places is that the state and federal government are driving
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:28.120]  policies to get the police to be more aggressive that's what they're teaching them that's why
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:32.440]  they're calling it the shoot first curriculum in new mexico that's why one of the instructors
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:38.040]  refused to teach that it'd been an instructor for quite some time they fired him it's they're
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:45.000]  changing the rules of engagement they're changing the way they view the citizens of the of america
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.200]  they're teaching them that they're operating in a battle zone that is fundamentally what the ndaa
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:56.440]  was about it was under the assumption that the entire world including american streets was a
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:00.840]  battle zone and that they were going to be able to use the military to pick up people to hold them
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:07.880]  to detain them without trial without and hold them indefinitely without ever accusing them
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:13.960]  of anything as if they were on a military battlefield it falls right into line with
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:19.320]  it being a psi op i mean if things like this things like this are continuously happening
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:24.360]  because it has somebody like me who has common sense and training i'm scared of the police
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:30.840]  yes i'm scared to death of the police i have three young children and this could happen to any one
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:38.600]  of us yes and the the fact that the fact that no medical care was called like i watched the entire
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:45.080]  video the moment that they seen that they were going to have a physical confrontation irregardless
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:50.040]  of whether lethal force was going to be applied e and t should have been called they were in rocky
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.040]  terrain they even if they were going to have to physically detain that guy somebody was getting
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:59.560]  hurt yeah so so there was there was obviously things that didn't happen and to see the police chief
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:05.960]  uh get get on television and say that they they've followed procedures to the t is nauseating
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:14.840]  it was it was just really no there's no this is a this is a symptom of the systemic poisoning
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:23.080]  that we have in the united states and and these cops are a symptom of the overfloridated gmo
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:32.040]  bloated mindless lobotomized people and they have no common sense they do not think yeah like i don't
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:38.120]  know how many homeless people you've been around but guns have value people who are homeless usually
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:43.000]  don't have a lot of money and if they have something of value it's good it goes to something else
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.880]  that's very right yes thank you so much you're exactly right it's it's a escalating this beyond
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.040]  all reason and anybody that hasn't seen this really needs to take a look at it a good way to
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:50:00.040]  see it is when alex jones saw it for the first time it was pretty amazing i was i was amazed as i
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:05.400]  watched i i couldn't i couldn't sit still had to stand up to watch this let's go to uh forest in
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:12.520]  california forest hi david howdy um yeah i'd like to talk about our free speech and the bill of
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:16.840]  rights and how it's really a vehicle for peace love and prosperity and if we don't use it we're
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:21.320]  going to lose it it's just like if we have a car parked on the street for weeks on it it'll be towed
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:26.520]  and uh so you know you know somebody has to at least use it to move it somewhere else
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:32.040]  and uh i want to talk about how this show and all the documentary and all the hard work you guys are
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:38.360]  doing is part of god's plan on on earth having heaven on earth and the president forever more
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:44.680]  and we are to pray without ceasing there's a every time we expose corruption uh the anti-american
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:49.880]  anti-constitutional laws policies and actions that is a prayer and we also need to keep our eye on the
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:54.760]  prize like what we do want very good point we're going to go to a commercial break we're going to
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:58.600]  talk about that after we come back we're going to talk about how we should live you know that was a
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:02.760]  question that francis schaefer acts hang on we'll be right there has always been nature's very own

[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:24.600]  go to david in new mexico david you said you were at the rally yes i was good good morning david
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:29.640]  my name is david and i was at the rally yesterday i also went to the one on tuesday i had a few
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:34.200]  points i wanted to make here sure at the rally i actually made a few statements there and i just
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:39.080]  wanted to mention that i did call for governor martinez mayor barry and chief eden to all be
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:44.280]  held accountable because they're obviously complicit in this act um if you look at the tape you can
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.920]  clearly hear and i quote this from the tape which is one of the officers saying in a private world if
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:53.480]  you were down at a bar or a bus stop i would have the right to kill you right now because you're
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:58.760]  trying to take me over don't get stupid with me wow secondly i i also wanted to make another point
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:04.040]  um k r q e the mainstream media here is also involved in the cover-up as well um on their
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:08.360]  website they're the ones that actually uh you can look at this article up there on their website
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:14.680]  it's called apd officer involved shooting justified k r q e dot com on the article it actually says
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:18.200]  they tried to claim that boy does the one that's making that statement there so they're actually
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:24.360]  twisting it and lying about the article um oh yeah the media the media came after shane harger this
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:29.480]  police chief from him in his springs and tried to paint him as somebody that was evil because he
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:35.800]  had two ids well he had two ids because he showed up at a shooting where an albuquerque police
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:41.080]  officer's wife had been shot the police officer was saying that it was a suicide that she'd
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:46.040]  committed with his service revolver but shane harger didn't believe it was a suicide it didn't
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:50.120]  look consistent with that and although it was out of their jurisdiction even though it was in the
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:56.680]  county there were police officers lieutenant i think as a detective uh who showed up and started
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:02.360]  destroying evidence and shane harger would not back down off of his story he changed his name
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:07.000]  because he got death threats so yeah there are some good cops out there i'm sorry i i interrupted
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:11.480]  you had some other points to make i am aware of the case actually i'm i'm familiar with sandoval
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:16.200]  county where that sheriff was located in him in springs um but i just wanted to mention though
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:20.360]  please check out that article it's a pd officer involved shooting justified and the media is trying
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:25.640]  to say boy does the one thing it when it's clear that the officer's saying that um yeah the media
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:31.000]  the media is definitely complicit in a lot of this um they were the ones trying to demonize
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.880]  shane harger go ahead well the problem is it's systemic corruption whether it's the government
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.760]  or the media they're all they all seem to be involved one other point i am an engineer as well
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:45.400]  a civil engineer i'm part of the member of a 9 11 truth i've signed the petition calling for a
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:49.480]  new investigation and as i mentioned it's so systemic that even the engineering boards won't
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:54.280]  even uh they won't even confront this issue i've contacted all 50 engineering boards personally
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:58.120]  as well as the american society civil engineers and they totally ignore the fact that wilk straight

[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:31.000]  host for this hour and we've been talking to callers about riots that took place over the weekend
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:37.800]  one of them in arizona we saw this video of a police officer i guess we could call him a police
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:42.200]  officer i think he's just a thug actually using his baton instead of as one of the crew members
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:47.880]  here pointed out using his baton instead of his hands because that would be assault but he can
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:52.280]  use his baton to push this young lady who's just standing there walking along with a drink in her
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:59.800]  hand knocked her right over i mean how can we allow quote unquote government servants to continue
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:05.320]  to do this we have to get these people under control we have to get them under control now
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:11.400]  people are trying to do that in mexico who we saw the murder of a homeless man by police officers
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:16.360]  excused by the police chief there immediately we've had many people call in talking about
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:20.680]  the rules of engagement as they were trained of course we know anybody that has taken for
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:26.760]  instance the concealed carry class knows that you cannot shoot somebody when they are no threat to
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:31.560]  you clearly if you watch this video the man was no threat to them i wanted to move on to some
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:37.400]  different news now we had came out today on info wars paul joseph was in story that bill de berg
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:44.120]  2014 has been uncovered they are going to meet in denmark yes this is the secretive organization
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:50.280]  of global power brokers that for many decades of course did not exist according to the mainstream
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:55.800]  media many of us are pointing that out alex jones has been on that from the get go but of course
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:02.600]  we were scoffed at and laughed at alex was called a conspiracy theorist to even use the word
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:10.520]  bill de berg and yet it's now become a open secret still secretive they still don't tell people
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:16.520]  what's going on there we can see who is going on there and of course last year the focus apparently
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:24.520]  was big data we saw the likes of jeff bezos people who were involved with palantir paypal and other
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:30.360]  organizations like that showing up at bill de berg talking about what they were going to do and
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:34.760]  so this year will be no different and of course as paul joseph wasen points out his article
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:42.200]  in 2009 bill de berg chairman we even bragged about how the euro single currency was a brain
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:47.960]  child of the bill de berg group leaked minutes from the i think it was a 1956 meeting it was
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:53.720]  close to one of their first meetings showed how they were planning at the time for the e u
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:58.760]  and for the euro they were planning consolidation they were planning global world government
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:03.800]  and last year we had an italian lawyer that requested the public prosecutor of roam to
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:08.920]  investigate bill de berg for criminal activity questioning whether the group's 2011 meeting
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:14.280]  in switzerland led to the selection of mario monti as the prime minister of italy of course
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:22.280]  that is an unelected person mario monti was unelected he is a former goldman sacks banker
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:28.200]  and they just took out the guy that had been elected and they put in the goldman sacks banker
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:33.160]  calling him a technocrat because that makes it okay if you call him a technocrat now
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:37.960]  there's other kinds of meetings just besides bill de berg of course and we saw one that was very
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:45.400]  interesting over the weekend we saw chris christie and jeb bush and john casick and scott walker all
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:52.200]  governors or former governors all going to vegas to meet a sugar daddy for the republican party
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:04:00.040]  that would be sheldon adelman adelson and if you remember the 2012 elections he had a big
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:09.480]  role to play in vegas in the caucuses there it was a pretty disgusting display of corrupt power
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:15.560]  in my opinion and they reported this in the new york times seeking political revival christie joins
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:24.680]  2016 contenders at a gop forum now they're talking for the most part because sheldon adelson is a
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:31.160]  neocon he especially when it comes to israel he's part of the republican jewish coalition
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:39.480]  a and he has contributed a lot of money in the last election cycle just his family 93 million
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:44.280]  dollars and so we're going to report about it was actually kind of funny what happened to chris
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:49.720]  christie as he's trying to get himself out of bridgegate when he went to vegas we'll be right back
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:59.640]  with that information and more of your calls so stay tuned

[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:21.960]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex
[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:30.520]  jones welcome back to the alex jones show we just had some news on info wars about the bill
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:36.040]  de berg conference where it's going to be it's going to be in uh in mark this year but there's
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:41.000]  actually something else that happened this weekend and that was the scheldon primary haven't you
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:47.880]  heard the scheldon primary you know that's scheldon adelson remember back in 2012 this was the guy in
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:53.160]  los vegas that got his very own caucus that's right that was the way the atlantic reported it
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:09:01.000]  this was the guy who had a caucus that was just for jewish people and nobody else is going to
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  be allowed to go to that because see if you had to work as a working mom and you couldn't attend the
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:14.120]  caucuses on saturday night then you are not going to be allowed to go to the caucus on sunday that
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:20.440]  was only only going to be for jewish voters well that's not the way it turned out people showed up
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:26.600]  anyway and said you can't exclude us based on religion from caucusing if you're going to add
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:31.720]  another day for convenience for somebody else or because they have a reason that they can't attend
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:37.320]  on saturday night then you're going to allow us to come in too it's no more of a reason to say that
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:40.920]  you can't do it for religious reasons and to say that you can't do it because you're working a job
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:47.000]  so this guy who had his very own caucus in novata and it was a very very corrupt caucus this is one
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:53.320]  of those caucuses where the gop showed its worst most corrupt side and there were several of those
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:58.200]  and there were state officials that got taken out of office because of that but now it's coming
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:05.480]  up to the 2016 elections and this same guy sheldon adelson is holding the sheldon primary now that
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:11.640]  was just this last weekend and that was the way it was reported from herettes that's a jewish
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:15.560]  newspaper he's deciding who he's going to put his money on and of course he's got a lot of money
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:20.840]  to put down this guy's a multi-billionaire and he gave 93 million dollars in the last presidential
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:28.760]  election let's put that into perspective al gore and 2000 spent about 100 million dollars total
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:35.800]  okay sheldon gave 93 million dollars in the last election for president now of course in that
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:43.080]  election bush spent about 200 so combined they had about 300 million dollars now let's fast forward
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:50.840]  to the last election it's been going up rapidly in 2012 it was over two billion dollars it was
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:58.440]  spent between obama and romney so you go from 300 million in 2000 where people were accusing
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:02.920]  these guys of over the top spending because it was so much higher than they'd ever had before
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:10.920]  accused bush of buying the election now we go from 300 million in 2000 to two billion little
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:18.760]  over two billion in 2012 amazing amazing how it is going up like what is that a factor of seven
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:26.200]  in just 12 years in just a few election cycles and of course where did he put that money back in
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:32.040]  2012 edelson was backing gingrich so he doesn't have a very good track record but he does like
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:37.720]  to back people who are neocons people who are pushing for war especially people who are pushing
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:44.920]  for war with the arabs because he is a zionist he's part of the republican jewish coalition
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:49.720]  and so as i pointed out in the york times seeking political revival christie joins
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:56.920]  2016 contenders at a GOP forum that would be the scheldon primary now what was on store there
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:02.840]  they were pushing back against ran paul essentially ran paul was not there but he was the punching
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:06.920]  bag for everybody he was a pinata that everybody was kicking back against because they were all
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:13.160]  trying to show how strong and militaristic they were going to be this is chris christie jeb bush
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:19.160]  jeb bush john casick scott walker republican governors some still in office most still in
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:23.320]  office as walker said if they don't believe we're strong they'll take action jeb bush said
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:31.160]  we can't have american passivity and it says in a sign of mounting anxiety about the presidential
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:35.480]  aspirations of senator ram paul of kentucky who has complained that american foreign policy
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:43.960]  is too overreaching jeb bush pointedly warned against isolationism seen as a rebuttal to mr paul
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:50.120]  now the interesting thing is i think the reaction what what john casick did of course he's governor
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:55.480]  of ohio he delivered a luncheon speech on saturday to a crowd of several hundred he repeatedly
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:02.040]  referred to scheldon as if the billionaire were the only other person in the room see he's not
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:07.880]  auditioning for president he's auditioning for puppet he wants to be his puppet but the most
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:11.320]  interesting thing the funniest thing about it was as christie is trying to pull himself back
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:17.480]  from bridgegate what he does is he's bragging about how you know he's trying to make common
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:22.280]  cause with the jewish people there and so he talks about how you know israel it's about the size of
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:26.680]  new jersey and um maybe he should have said maybe it's about the same number of characters in the
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:30.920]  name only if you're in common court is it have the same number of characters but you know he's
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:36.760]  bragging about how they're they're kind of common but he touched off disapproving whispers according
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:43.480]  to the york times from the crowd when he described flying over occupied territories where palestinians
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:48.440]  live oops oops we're not supposed to use that term when you're dressing a zionist organization
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:53.240]  a prominent jewish leader morton cline said he tried to correct mr christie as he left the stage
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:14:00.920]  urging him to use different language like quote disputed territory mr christie scowled he said and
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:05.160]  i and did not say whether he would do so in the future i was shocked said mr cline national president
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:11.480]  of the zionist organization of america but that's okay christ christie saw the light when he met
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:17.160]  in person with sheldon a few hours later during a one-on-one meeting with mr adelson
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:24.520]  mr christie apologized for the phrase see when america attacks and occupies a country or israel
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:31.560]  attacks and occupies people we do it as liberators we're not occupiers say we're the good guys but
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:36.200]  what does this get mr adelson when he spends 93 million dollars on an election what does this
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.840]  get him well he actually gets a pretty good return on investment take a look at this story from the
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:47.640]  huffington post just last week bills banning online gambling we're introduced in congress pull this up
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:52.920]  guys this huffington post article look whose picture is there it's miss lindsay graham miss
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:58.040]  lindsay graham is the guy who is carrying his water of course they're on the same page as far as
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:03.320]  starting wars too aren't they but lawmakers from both parties introduced legislation in the house
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:10.600]  and senate on wednesday to ban online gambling okay and this is something that mr is is
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:16.920]  dear to the heart of sheldon adelson as a matter of fact he's already gone to war with the american
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:22.520]  gaming association so the dispute says according to the new york times and another article seeking
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:28.120]  to ban online betting gop donors test the influence it says the dispute is already largely sideline
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:33.640]  the industry's powerful trade group the american gaming association after mr adelson threatened
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:40.360]  to withdraw from the organization if it continued to back expanded online gambling according to several
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:46.200]  industry executives so the gambling industry is afraid of mr adelson and he seems to be able to
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:53.800]  get people like lindsay graham and chris christie to kiss his let's put it lightly ring okay kissing
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:16:01.400]  the ring of this guy whatever he wants okay they're for sale you're for sale your country is for sale
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:08.280]  from the people like lindsay graham chris christie jeb bush john casick scott walker
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:13.640]  those are people you need to watch out for because they're going they're up for sale
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:19.000]  they're basically prostitutes whoring themselves out to the highest bidder and it makes a lot
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:24.680]  of sense for mr adelson to spend 93 million dollars on a presidential election that's
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:30.120]  chump change compared to the amount of money he can make if he can get rid of his competitors
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:36.280]  this is why corporations always work with government see it isn't that government is
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:42.520]  necessarily the bad guy unless they're worried they're not going to protect you from the corporations
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:47.400]  they're in they're being controlled by the corporations that's what people on the left
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:52.920]  and the right don't understand they always want to demonize the government or demonize the
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:58.200]  corporations or say that their guy can do no wrong the the thing is they're both merged at the hip
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:04.200]  you can't tell where the large corporations stop and where big government ends it's a symbiotic
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:09.560]  relationship let's take another call anthony in pennsylvania you want to talk about the
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:13.800]  difference between 1984 and brave new world that i was talking about earlier you have comment
[02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:20.280]  yeah i did that uh great show it's anthony antinello from pennsylvania um and when i
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:26.600]  went as soon as i heard you say that i i had to pick up the phone and uh give you a call because
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:34.600]  the way the way i see it and it's becoming so obvious to so many of us uh when we see those
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:42.360]  videos and like the one from new mexico the the actual murder i i mean it happens on a regular
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:48.680]  basis and when you see kelly thomas what what was it two out of the five or six police officers
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:56.200]  were actually uh charged and they were even acquitted yeah so you know this this is a systemic
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:02.920]  problem the the new thing i did notice in that video did you notice the the camera angle that
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:08.840]  they released it it reminds me of and i'm not a video game player but it reminds me of one of
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:15.160]  those first person shooter that's right that's right right so it's more of this acclimation
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:20.280]  getting people you know have to have them to it this is the first generation of uh
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:27.640]  the video gamers that are now soldiers but the way i see brave new world in 1984 i believe
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:34.360]  that they are doubling down with both i believe they would rather a brave new world they would
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:40.120]  rather people dumb down that's why they have the the jambos the fluoride uh they're hitting us up
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:48.520]  with um common core and dumbing down the entire society uh mainstream media propaganda so they
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:54.680]  would rather that but there are still people like us that are personally waging this you know war
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:19:01.560]  of information trying to wake people up and that's where their plan be or you know to make sure that
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:08.120]  everything goes the way they want that's their 1984 that's their technocracy and and then having
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:15.480]  complete control over everything they we do so you put those two together and you know this this
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:22.280]  really is there in the world order and it is playing out right in front of us in real time when
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:29.080]  you look at pictures of uh people getting shot in the head uh by the Gestapo okay what is the
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:34.600]  difference and people are so shocked oh my god how can that happen well it's happening right now
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:41.000]  we're seeing videos of it you know the the quote unquote the state murdering that's right that's
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:46.200]  right they they want to believe that it isn't going to happen to them in the same way that people
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:50.840]  who were rounded up by the Gestapo wanted to believe that they weren't headed to an execution
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:55.320]  that they were just headed to a prison camp or that something good was going to happen to them
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:59.640]  if they were just nice and harmless we're gonna be right back thank you anthony we're gonna take

[02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:14.760]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today and we're taking calls
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:20.040]  mostly mostly calls have been about the shooting that happened in albuquerque of course there was
[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:26.040]  a demonstration yesterday went on for 10 hours reports were that there were at least 500 people
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:31.240]  there once it dwindled down to 100 things got violent and we've talked to a couple of people who
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:38.040]  were there into mexico and we've had um we've been asking callers for solutions what do you
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:44.680]  think we can do to get control of this militarized unaccountable police that we see at every level
[02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:51.000]  and of course we saw this also with the riots in arizona the wildcat game that was lost we see
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:56.760]  this cop just walking out of nowhere clocking a young girl for no reason she's not doing anything
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:03.080]  at all what do we do to get control of the people that we've given this kind of essentially a monopoly
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:09.880]  of force because if you oppose them they will kill you it's what it underscores the reason why we
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:15.560]  cannot afford to give up our guns we cannot give them a true monopoly of force can you imagine
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:21.480]  how much worse how much more rapidly this would deteriorate if they knew that nobody even had
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:28.280]  any guns at some point that has to be a deterrent it's just like the neutral assured destruction
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:35.960]  of the u.s and russia having nuclear weapons that's the idea of the population having firearms it's
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:41.880]  there to serve as a deterrent against a tyrannical government and of course the other part of the
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:46.680]  plan was that we were never supposed to have a standing military like we've had since the end
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:52.920]  of world war two they always knew that the means of defense against tyranny abroad would become
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:56.440]  the means of defense against enemies abroad would become the means of tyranny at home
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:03.320]  it's just human nature the founders understood that they warned us about that they tried to set up
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:08.280]  controls and checks and balances to stop that but we've ignored their advice we've ignored the checks
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:14.040]  and balances and now we have a problem on our hand and so we've been taking callers and josh
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:19.000]  in uh washington you've been holding for quite some time uh tell us what you wanted to uh say
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.960]  about this hi david uh i just want to say you're doing a great job of the daily show uh i just
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:30.600]  have a few topics i'd like to touch on sure go ahead thank you as far as uh your idea there to
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:35.480]  make the officers and the department split the bill for their tyranny i think that's a great idea
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:40.280]  and uh i think some people might argue that uh that still comes out of the government coffers
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:45.240]  but at least that would give us a paper trail leads back to the offending departments and
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:52.200]  whatnot and uh really that money is going to talk louder than any you know uh abusive action that
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:56.920]  they they do if they're spending too much money they'll stop them i think yes i think we have to
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:27:01.080]  make them accountable at some way at the very least financially accountable make the police
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:05.640]  department's financially accountable cut their budget make the make homeland security give them
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.640]  all their weapons for free just probably what they would do i don't know any other comments you
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:15.000]  want to make um well i also want to talk about obama care a little bit there uh go ahead i've uh
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:20.280]  i've talked to people on different forms and whatnot on on on this and you know back in the
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:29.240]  day it's just the obama cult of personality was very strong but uh even nowadays on uh on forms
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:34.200]  where you know people aren't very you know it's not about politics but you know and you talk to
[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:39.720]  people and they are getting the picture this is the this is the clench pen i think and i want to
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:47.400]  know uh do you think that the mandate's going to last after this administration ends and if
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:53.720]  if that would be regardless of what party gets in there next well i hope it will ted cruz has said
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:28:00.680]  that he thinks that he can end it i hope he can we need to the government doesn't have any authority
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:05.240]  to force us to buy insurance but we see the government doing things that it has no constitutional
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:09.480]  authority for all the time anyway i mean look at the war on drugs that's where we really first
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:14.280]  saw the militarization of the police that's where we really saw swat teams use for the first time
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:19.880]  no not grade use for the first time it was a war on our civil liberties from the get go and they had
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:25.080]  no authority for it when they had alcohol prohibition they had to pass a constitutional
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:30.120]  amendment because at the time people acknowledged the authority of the constitution they knew that
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:35.800]  they had no authority to ban anything so they passed a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:38.920]  then when they decided they weren't going to ban alcohol they passed another constitutional
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:44.120]  amendment so we got 20 some odd amendments two of them are about giving the government permission to
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:49.240]  ban alcohol or a particular substance whatever it is and then another one to undo it so where do
[02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:54.680]  they get off telling us that we can or cannot have anything in our life they don't have the
[02:28:54.680 --> 02:29:00.120]  authority the ninth and tenth amendments make that clear that that authority has not been given to
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:05.480]  them they don't have under the commerce clause or under the general welfare clause they don't have
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:10.440]  the authority to extrapolate that into broad powers the tenth amendment says that if it's
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:15.800]  not specifically given to you you don't have it if it's not enumerated you don't have it
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:22.440]  that's the situation so they ignore the law but it'll be interesting to see what happens there
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:27.880]  are a lot of republicans who are in the pockets of the insurance companies and make no doubt about
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:36.040]  it when obama spent 1.2 billion dollars to get elected he was he owed money to corporate donors
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:43.000]  this is a payback this is a redistribute redistribution of wealth from the american people
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:47.320]  to these corporations and there are republicans who are involved in that as well we'll be right back
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:56.760]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:05.800]  the globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda they are manipulating
[02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:11.080]  our genetics we are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our

[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:29.320]  paul joseph watson's article about cops inspecting homes without notice for illegal tenants has been
[02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:33.480]  picked up by drudge is on the drudge report of course this is the story we've been talking about
[02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:38.840]  where authorities in long island have launched a crackdown on homeowners who rent their house out to
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:45.160]  illegal tenants under a zero tolerance program that will see police conduct home inspections
[02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:53.560]  without notice without warrants guess what guys if you don't have property rights you are the property
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:34:01.640]  you are a slave if you don't have property rights okay get that make that clear to people
[02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:06.600]  and look at the way they spend this this is why i decorate paul joseph watson picked up a quote from
[02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:14.520]  the news 12 interview with mayor peter cavallaro he said permitting property owners to call the
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:21.720]  shots on rentals in their home would quote victimize the community as a whole see it's not about you
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:26.600]  it's we got to protect the community those bad people with a private property you know they
[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:32.120]  we can't like them make decisions about what they're going to do with their property we need
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:37.560]  to just swat team them if we even suspect that we don't need any warrants we're going to have
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:43.800]  zero tolerance we've heard that before we've heard zero tolerance we've heard mandatory minimums
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:49.880]  this is the same old stuff the same tactics that have been tried with the war of drugs at the same
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:56.280]  time our government is cracking down on the war of drugs they're also running the drug trade look
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:02.440]  at what happened in afghanistan they were down to 10 of the world's poppy supply used for things
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:08.280]  like heroin after we get in it goes to 90 look at what was happening under reagan at the same time
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:16.520]  he's talking about a zero tolerance program and mandatory minimums they're running drugs with the
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:22.920]  contrast to fund a secret war that's the way this thing rolls just like this guy from california the
[02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:30.040]  state legislator who's the biggest gun grabber writing all these gun regulations at the same time
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:37.160]  he's running guns and gets caught by the fbi it's just amazing the hypocrisy i want to
[02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:41.800]  depart from what we've been talking about here for just a moment about the police state about
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:48.280]  what's going on in albuquerque there were several articles today on info wars about environmentalism
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:53.080]  and we've got james lovelock saying that environmentalism has become a religion this is a guy from
[02:35:53.080 --> 02:36:00.760]  england he's the scientist who came up with the gaya hypothesis now of course gaya is a greek
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:07.160]  for the earth it's the hypothesis that the earth is a self-regulating single organism
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:13.240]  say that the earth is this living organism and humans are a virus and as i pointed out
[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:16.840]  yesterday when i was in london with my sons and they were young we went to the children's museum
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:22.520]  in the play area they were running this virulent propaganda film i i recorded i've got to find it
[02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:28.280]  my archive somewhere it's kind of like um bustman's holiday i don't ever have time to go edit my own
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:35.000]  films or the or the inclination to do so after i've been doing it here but this was an amazing
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:40.600]  piece of propaganda portraying the human race as a destructive virus that needed to either be kept
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:46.440]  to a minimum you know like 90 reduction population or eliminated all together for the good of the
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:51.240]  earth now the guy who came up with that hypothesis said that he was also too certain about the rate
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:57.240]  of global warming he says it's just as silly to be a climate denier as it is to be a believer
[02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:03.560]  and he said that we should get our power from fracking and nuclear power well maybe actually
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:09.960]  he does want to get rid of humans i don't think i would look at those as a way to go it's interesting
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:14.840]  that they use the term denier because it is a religion it's the same as calling somebody an
[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:19.720]  infidel and he says that he says it's become a religion and religions don't worry too much
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:25.960]  about facts and look at this report from paul joseph watson today on info wars liberal fascist
[02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:33.000]  calls for global warming skeptics to be arrested that's right burn those infidels okay this is a
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:38.840]  as he points out paul joseph watson says a demented rant by gockers adam Weinstein calls
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:43.720]  for thought criminals who question man-made global warming to be arrested and thrown in prison
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:49.640]  actually we have some very compelling scientific data and measurements to back it up to deny that
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:55.880]  there's global warming but anyway this is what the demented gocker rant said he said we have
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:01.160]  laws on the books to punish anyone whose lives contribute to people's deaths it's time to punish
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:07.000]  these climate change liars those denialists should face jail they should face fines they
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:11.480]  should face lawsuits from classes of people whose lives and livelihoods are most threatened by the
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:21.800]  denialist tactics this is liberal intolerance liberal hate okay this is the same sort of thing
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:27.960]  that we saw last week as arguments are being made before hobby lobby we saw people like john
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:35.560]  stewart coming out and ridiculing hobby lobby as jesus christ superstore and saying who are they to
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:41.640]  decide you know not only are they uh it appears that anybody no matter how stupid can claim a
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:48.840]  religious exemption it's like yeah that's right you don't get to decide mr stewart whether somebody
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:53.640]  has a religious belief or what that religious belief is that's what the first amendment is about
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:39:00.040]  is to protect you as well as other people voltair understood that when he said i may not agree with
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:04.200]  you but i'll defend to the death you're right to say what it is you want to say that's what
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:10.040]  first amendment and religious freedoms are about you don't get to decide the intolerant liberals
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:16.200]  don't get to decide the intolerant conservatives don't get to decide you have freedom and only
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:21.960]  have freedom if you support that choice for other people but going back to this whole thing about
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:28.680]  it being a religion and deniers being infidels we can see this in the movie that just came out
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:35.400]  this last week and noa another article from info wars up from michael snider and noa the fallen
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:39.400]  angels are the good guys he points out and noa the fallen angels are good guys that were kicked
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:43.720]  out of heaven because of their compassion for humanity they helped noa build the ark and
[02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:48.840]  they ascend to heaven when they die helping to defend the ark against a band of marauding evil
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:55.080]  humans there in erinofsky the director stated that he attempted to make the least biblical
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:00.840]  biblical film ever made well i think he accomplished that but did he really make anything that anybody
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:07.560]  wants to see there's a director brian godawa and he got a release of the script before it came out
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:13.960]  and he was telling everybody that this really is not at all about the biblical story of noa it's
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:19.720]  about that being hijacked for a different religion for an environmentalist religion
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:24.280]  and that's exactly what it is he saw it this last week and he said yeah you know i had a lot of
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:27.880]  people criticized me because it was a preliminary script and they said i was going to be different
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:32.680]  but he said yeah actually i was right when i saw it and by the way let me tell you
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:37.400]  brian godawa is a very good screenwriter if you haven't seen his film that he wrote the screen
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:43.640]  play for to end all wars that's an excellent film he said over and over again that he believes that
[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:49.800]  all really good stories are stories about redemption that they echo essentially the
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:55.160]  redemptive story of christ and he really does portray that into end all wars it's a story
[02:40:55.160 --> 02:41:01.640]  that takes place in world war two and he doesn't beat people over the head he doesn't set it in a
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:10.120]  roman toga and sandals venue he's got it in a modern context but the message comes across very
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:15.080]  clearly i think everybody would enjoy that whether you're a christian or not but his take on the noa
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:21.480]  movie he says it's simply ugly anti-human exceptionalism it's in viral agit prop in
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:27.080]  other words it's environmental propaganda to agitate people and he says that like the last
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:32.360]  impatient of christ all the controversy overshadowed the fact that it is just plain
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:38.200]  terrible storytelling he said at least with avatar with its naked pagan earth worship
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:43.240]  it has a ring of more authenticity than just trying to subvert someone else's sacred narrative
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:48.680]  with silly rock people and bad guys who cling to their guns and eat meat because they really do
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:53.560]  demonize the people who eat meat even though we see that in the been told i haven't seen the movie
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:58.440]  i've been told that noa is anti-human he wants to get rid of the humans even to the extent of
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:05.160]  wanting to kill his granddaughters on the ark because he does not want humans to continue so
[02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:12.840]  a very very much the agenda that we see with guy and these religions radical earth firsters who
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:17.480]  want to destroy the human race as we see with things like the georgia guide stones where they
[02:42:17.480 --> 02:42:21.480]  want to eviscerate the human population and you know what maybe they'll get their wish
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:26.280]  we've got an outbreak of ebola that's jumping across the borders it kills 90% of the people and
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:31.640]  as the eugenesis here in austin said as alex has pointed out many times he was saying that that's
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:37.640]  exactly what we need we need an airborne ebola virus to rapidly get rid of 90% of the earth's
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:44.040]  population aids takes far too long we want something like the ebola virus and so maybe
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:47.880]  they're going to get their wish who knows there's something to look out for let's go back to your
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:53.800]  calls we've got barry in ohio you wanted to say something about brave new world i believe
[02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:59.320]  uh yeah actually i did and it was kind of weird as i was here on hold i had a strange
[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:04.200]  confluence about the two topics that you've got going on here okay when you talk about
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:11.560]  this topic novels the most appropriate one is going to be fair night 451
[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:17.800]  okay in fair night 451 there are no doctors there are no nurses there are technicians
[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:23.720]  the machines do the work there's no society everyone spends their money on video walls
[02:43:25.160 --> 02:43:29.000]  right and everyone everyone that can only talk about what they have on the video walls
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:37.080]  and they call them the family my family is on the video wall right that's right and everyone
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:43.880]  lives in fear of the fire dog which is of course a robotic spider yeah with a lethal injection
[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:52.120]  and they contract people by their DNA set now here's the important part the hero in the story
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:59.400]  escapes that's kind of important because they can get away with this now there is a man that is killed
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:04.920]  for no reason they sent the you know the dog out to kill a man and the dog kills the man
[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:11.560]  it's not about the hero escaping it's not about the man who dies it's about all of the people
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:17.400]  that stand in line you know the people that keep their head down the people that just want to get
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:22.520]  by the people that just uh you know get on with society that sort of thing right yes yes when
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:29.080]  you look at the shooting out there in under mexico you know the gentleman you know was doing
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:33.400]  nothing wrong he lost his life that's regrettable the police are going to you know do whatever they
[02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:41.080]  do but think about how many thousands of people aren't going to be in that park that's right that's
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:47.000]  right yeah that's uh exactly exactly right you know it is sad isn't it how we're living in this
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:53.800]  dystopian future it's a confluence of a lot of all the worst things that we've seen in the movies
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:59.240]  and books i mean we also see the rise of robots and we see elements of the terminator being planned
[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:05.160]  by darpa i mean it is it's really frightening but and we don't know what the future holds but as
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:12.360]  many people said we know who holds the future and one of the key hopes is for the churches to not be
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:19.720]  part of the see something say something not fall into this misappropriation of romans nine but to
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:26.360]  stand up and take the moral high ground and lead from the front that's the only thing that's going
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:31.240]  to stop this that's the only thing where people are going to have the courage to stand up to this
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:37.720]  if they know that there is something greater and higher than just being taken down that's what needs
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:43.160]  to happen that's what we need from the churches and it remains to be seen if they're going to do
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:47.880]  that at all thank you that was a very thoughtful call barry in Ohio let's go to uh ian in colorado ian
[02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:55.080]  hello how are you doing fine what you got hey uh i just want to touch base and say with every
[02:45:55.080 --> 02:46:01.960]  issue you've talked about today i i know about i am i'm on your side with it but what the people
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:07.560]  need to know is we need boots on the ground and what i mean by that is i need people to be
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:13.560]  delegate and i need people to go out and caucus and be a delegate typically when we say someone
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:18.200]  needs to go out and vote it's it's a lost cause people feel destitute and for a good reason
[02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:23.720]  but if somebody actually becomes it goes out and caucus and becomes a delegate
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:29.800]  their voice will be heard delegates are known as super voters yes you decide who gets put on the
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:34.920]  ballot and you decide which agenda gets pushed forward i think that's great there's the states
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:42.840]  that have caucuses i was very happy with the grassroots movement and the caucuses last time
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:48.680]  saw that coalescing around ron paul but there was a lot of shenanigans going on the caucuses as well
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:54.360]  well and it appears that the gop has behind the scenes been making adjustments to that what's
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:59.560]  your take on that do you think they have found a way to essentially shut down caucuses and the
[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:04.360]  states that do have them they are working on it believe it or not that's why we need people
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:09.560]  to get involved now right we need people to get involved to stop that at this point i want people
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:13.240]  to know when i'm talking about voting i'm talking about being a super voter you're going to be part
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:19.240]  of the seal team six or dealt the force uh voting machine you're not going to be a regular voter
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:24.120]  you're going to be a super voter i need you i need your help help me help you for god's sake
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:28.520]  just help me very good point that's that's really important for people who are in caucus states
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:36.520]  now is a time to get involved the same republican hierarchy leadership that's going out and courting
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:43.320]  sheldon adelson is also trying to shut down the caucus system it's a much better system than the
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:51.160]  primaries why because it is so easy to rig a ballot voting one-on-one ballot voting it's much
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:55.800]  better with the caucus situations there are so many places where they can come in and corrupt
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:48:00.760]  the ballot system they can do it with illegal voters they can do it anytime you lose custody of
[02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:04.920]  the the ballots they can do it they can take over the voting machines very easily they can put
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:10.520]  viruses and these electronic voting machines we need to roll this back we need to make it simpler
[02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:17.720]  we need to have paper ballots we need to have a constant stream of monitoring and of control of
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:22.200]  these ballots as stallin said it doesn't matter who cast the votes it's who counts the votes
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:28.600]  it's a very bad situation that we have in elections but at the state levels and especially at the
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:33.640]  states where there are caucuses you can do something now you need to get involved now
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:38.760]  stop them from shutting this down and get active in the next time thank you it's very good call
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:42.120]  let's go to uh dean in florida you had uh something wanted to say about the police
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:51.240]  yes uh yes david how you doing today doing good what's up yeah um well you know i i've i've seen
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:57.800]  you know i've seen the um you know the pictures and i've i've read the stories regarding you know
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:04.440]  the slang of the homeless guy in the hills there and albuquerque and it just really made me i was
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:10.840]  in period for the last day and a half and finally i'm i'm starting to i'm starting to cool off a
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:19.400]  little bit but really what i think is this i think that um i think that the police in albuquerque
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:25.080]  right now i think the police department they're trying to act like the victim you know when
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:29.480]  when they had the the protesters marching through you know and they had all those police you know
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:33.800]  dressed up in their riot gear and then they were you know telling people well they couldn't
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:38.440]  lawfully assemble after i guess after a certain point you know and they were trying to they're
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:43.320]  trying to get the people to disperse and you know use the tear gas and everything you know they're
[02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:47.480]  trying to play they're trying to play the victim right now they they're not willing to admit that
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:52.840]  they're wrong and these are evil people okay the people that are the people that are doing this
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:59.240]  knowingly doing this police chief whoever whoever's involved even if it's the mayor of albuquerque
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:05.720]  it's just evil and i'll tell you you know what's really what really what really would have happened
[02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:12.120]  is had the had the protesters not dispersed and had they you know just stayed there and
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:18.840]  the police would have you know the police would have called in whatever you know you know maybe
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:23.080]  called in the military who knows that's right you know there would have there would have
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:29.400]  been deaths i mean if if people if people stand up now what's going to happen i mean i believe
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:34.120]  in standing up and if i had been able to be in albuquerque i would have been at that protest and
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:39.080]  i think maybe you know next time people ought to think about bringing some kind of a mask
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:44.120]  well it's not just albuquerque it's many places we saw the officer knocking down that young lady
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:48.760]  in arizona and it's something that's being pushed at the state level something's being
[02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:52.200]  pushed by the federal government we're gonna be right back with more of your calls bill in

[02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:26.280]  earlier about uh sheldon adelson he's the casino billionaire in las vegas and you may remember in
[02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:33.400]  2012 he had his own caucus as many news outlets reported it and of course that was going to be
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:40.840]  for jews only but many people crashed that caucus there was a lot of corruption around vegas in
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:47.800]  2012 and the presidential caucus is there now this last weekend he had the sheldon primary
[02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:57.080]  for 2016 where he has some of the front runners christ christie jeb bush come to him and kisses ring
[02:54:57.880 --> 02:55:04.120]  basically suck up to him and it remains to be seen what's going to happen with that of course now
[02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:09.000]  lindsay graham is also carrying water for him introduced a bill to stop online gambling see
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:14.360]  even though sheldon adelson gives 93 million dollars in the last presidential election
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:20.040]  he gets a very good return on his investment can you imagine how much is worth it for him
[02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:24.680]  if somebody like lindsay graham can get online gambling shut down
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:30.760]  mike rogers is leaving the house we need to get rid of lindsay graham guys in south carolina he's
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:36.520]  coming up for election this next time we've got a good tea party candidate there let's get lindsay
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:42.600]  graham out i don't know if he's going to go to talk radio or maybe uh i don't know i could kind of see
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:47.320]  lindsay graham more is a a broadway performer type you know maybe we could put him in a lounge
[02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:53.000]  or just a suit or something but somehow we got to get him out of congress this is a very dangerous
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:58.360]  repulsive corrupt individual he needs to be taken out of office people in south carolina
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:04.120]  please do your job we got bill in wisconsin wants to say something about sheldon adelson's primary
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:12.120]  go ahead yeah david thank you very much for bringing up a sheldon adelstein and all of his
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:19.880]  shenanigans on behalf of the zionist movement we're never going to have peace in the world
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:27.480]  until we you know get to the root of some of these problems and the big money that somebody like
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:37.720]  adelstein wields and promote certain candidates i think not only do we need to get rid of lindsay
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:47.640]  graham okay and more than likely he might uh get into ballet when he leaves office i'll be glad
[02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:56.520]  to see mike rogers go yes i am sick and tired of turning on uh talk shows on sunday and seeing
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:05.080]  mike rogers as you accurately pointed out promoting wars and the neocon agenda in the
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:13.240]  surveillance state oh yeah yeah but it's very uh illuminating uh in the true sense of the word
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:22.200]  the four candidates that went to uh last vegas they're to court the favor of sheldon adelstein
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:31.000]  chris christy jeb bush okay john casick and our own scott walker here from wisconsin
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:37.720]  mm-hmm he's done a few things that are decent but for the most part the real gut issues like
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:47.480]  common core and uh you know uh reducing the influence of the neocon agenda he hasn't done
[02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:52.680]  anything that's right so he's going to be he's going to be a new world order guy and the thing
[02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:59.080]  that bothers me about this sheldon primary is how out front and open they are about it
[02:57:59.080 --> 02:58:03.560]  and that's what we see with obama we see the corruption there we see the uh auditing of the
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:07.960]  tea party people with the irs and the fact that they just keep doing it they get away with it
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:13.720]  they're not even embarrassed about it anymore i mean at least nixon tried to cover it up
[02:58:13.720 --> 02:58:18.520]  at least they impeached nixon at least they forced him out of office today they just do
[02:58:18.520 --> 02:58:24.040]  whatever they want to and that's what we're seeing here in los vegas well that's it for today's show
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:39.960]  please join us again tomorrow alex jones will be back at 11 central noon eastern join us then
