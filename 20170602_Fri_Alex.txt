[00:30.000 --> 00:43.920]  In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States
[00:43.920 --> 01:10.440]  will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, but begin negotiations to re-enter either
[01:10.440 --> 01:19.120]  the Paris Accord or in really entirely new transaction, when terms that are fair to the
[01:19.120 --> 01:27.720]  United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
[01:27.720 --> 01:34.640]  So we're getting out, but we will start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a
[01:34.640 --> 01:43.000]  deal that's fair, and if we can, that's great, and if we can't, that's fine.
[01:43.000 --> 01:50.920]  As President, I can put no other consideration before the well-being of American citizens.
[01:50.920 --> 01:56.200]  The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement
[01:56.200 --> 02:04.840]  that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving
[02:04.840 --> 02:12.760]  American workers who I love and taxpayers who absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs,
[02:12.760 --> 02:21.200]  lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.
[02:21.200 --> 02:30.360]  Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris
[02:30.360 --> 02:40.880]  Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.
[02:40.880 --> 02:49.440]  This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution, and
[02:49.440 --> 03:03.960]  very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.
[03:03.960 --> 03:08.680]  Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the owner's energy restrictions that is
[03:08.680 --> 03:18.280]  placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025.
[03:18.280 --> 03:27.800]  According to the National Economic Research Associates, this includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing
[03:27.800 --> 03:39.960]  jobs, not what we need, including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital
[03:39.960 --> 03:48.000]  American industries on which countless communities rely.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.360]  They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.
[03:54.360 --> 04:01.560]  According to the same study by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the
[04:01.560 --> 04:12.760]  previous administration would cut production for the following sectors, paper down 12%,
[04:12.760 --> 04:29.200]  cement down 23%, iron and steel down 38%, coal, and I happen to love the coal miners,
[04:29.200 --> 04:36.320]  186%, natural gas down 31%.
[04:36.320 --> 04:44.920]  The cost of the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5
[04:44.920 --> 04:55.960]  million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and in many
[04:55.960 --> 05:01.800]  cases much worse than that.
[05:01.800 --> 05:28.640]  This is the first Bilderberg meeting since the populist uprisings of Brexit and the Trump
[05:28.640 --> 05:33.640]  administration are going to be attending HR McMaster, Wilbur Ross, and Chris Liddell.
[05:33.640 --> 05:38.280]  Most Trump insiders believe that these three are there to help the elites derail the current
[05:38.280 --> 05:39.280]  administration.
[05:39.280 --> 05:40.920]  There are two ways at which this can go.
[05:40.920 --> 05:44.520]  Either the Globals will try to bring Trump to heel, or they will try to impeach him after
[05:44.520 --> 05:45.520]  the 2018 election.
[05:45.520 --> 05:51.240]  You can read more about this and exclusive Bilderberg schemes to overthrow Trump on infowars.com.
[05:51.240 --> 05:54.480]  And ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds?
[05:54.480 --> 05:59.120]  Read this link and help wake up some minds, Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com and infowars
[05:59.120 --> 06:01.120]  nightly news.
[06:01.120 --> 06:07.280]  In America's 240-plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington
[06:07.280 --> 06:11.960]  and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their
[06:11.960 --> 06:15.560]  hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[06:15.560 --> 06:19.520]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about, is those that made the ultimate
[06:19.520 --> 06:22.320]  sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[06:22.320 --> 06:27.360]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had
[06:27.360 --> 06:32.400]  on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the
[06:32.400 --> 06:34.600]  line and didn't talk but took action.

[06:57.680 --> 07:00.840]  true trailblazers on which all of us stand.
[07:00.840 --> 07:06.040]  Emdix Essentials, that's my middle name, I've spent seven years off and on trying to
[07:06.040 --> 07:12.680]  get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of
[07:12.680 --> 07:15.360]  personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[07:15.360 --> 07:21.600]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[07:21.600 --> 07:26.760]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it and if they're such patriots they have let us
[07:26.760 --> 07:29.040]  basically keep their well-known packaging.
[07:29.040 --> 07:33.120]  It is an answer to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail,
[07:33.120 --> 07:36.240]  sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.

[07:58.000 --> 08:12.040]  find the entire line of Emdix Essentials.
[08:12.040 --> 08:38.920]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[08:38.920 --> 08:45.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are June 2nd, 2017, I'm your host Alex Jones, we're gonna
[08:45.200 --> 08:46.800]  be here live for the next four hours.
[08:46.800 --> 08:51.800]  Our reporters are on the ground in Chantilly, Virginia where the globalists are in camp
[08:51.800 --> 08:57.480]  secretly meeting at Bilderberg to admittedly plot the overthrow of President Trump.
[08:57.480 --> 09:01.160]  We know many of the attendees have publicly said they want to overthrow Trump, it's on
[09:01.160 --> 09:06.200]  the agenda that they want to quote, deal with Trump and so from our moles, the Paul Watson's
[09:06.200 --> 09:11.800]  writing story right now, we know their main agenda both from our intel and from what is
[09:11.800 --> 09:14.600]  publicly being put out.
[09:14.600 --> 09:21.720]  What Trump did yesterday, pulling out of the carbon tax, the global taxing system over
[09:21.720 --> 09:28.760]  carbon dioxide, one of the four elements needed for life on this planet, water, carbon dioxide,
[09:28.760 --> 09:38.580]  oxygen and of course sunlight, was an absolute total declaration of war against the austerity
[09:38.580 --> 09:46.960]  producing system of the globalist and then he walked through the complete and total abject
[09:46.960 --> 09:58.760]  massive fraud that is the entire anthropogenic warming, cooling, change line, which sets
[09:58.760 --> 10:03.780]  the globalist up as the saviors of the earth, and they need to regulate and control every
[10:03.780 --> 10:09.080]  facet of your life and if you don't let them do that, if you don't let them control your
[10:09.080 --> 10:12.520]  life, if you don't let them save you, if you don't let them regulate and tax you, well
[10:12.520 --> 10:21.240]  then you're gonna die, that's what a kidnapper says, get in the car, I'm gonna shoot you,
[10:21.240 --> 10:26.640]  don't scream, don't resist little girl, little boy or I'll hurt you, but the truth is if
[10:26.640 --> 10:32.600]  you get in the white creeper van, you know what really ends up happening, you know you
[10:32.600 --> 10:37.560]  end up getting taken to a basement or a shack and tortured to death and that's basically
[10:37.560 --> 10:42.160]  what globalism is in slow motion is the end of humanity, but the fact that it's been
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.400]  exposed, the fact that it's out in the open, there's no way to put it back together again.
[10:46.400 --> 10:54.200]  Trump in a 45 minute speech, I guess we count Pence was about 45 minutes, maybe 35 minute
[10:54.200 --> 11:02.240]  speech, total veritas, he just devastated it lock, stock and barrel from pillar to post,
[11:02.240 --> 11:07.280]  but the key was not even arguing the science all day because they'll debate that, China
[11:07.280 --> 11:13.280]  and India and 160 plus other third world developing nations have zero environmental cuts, they
[11:13.280 --> 11:19.640]  run dirty plants, not clean plants like ours, that's why there's not restrictions on mercury,
[11:19.640 --> 11:25.560]  I want it totally banned coming out of a smoke stack or carbon dust or whatever, no it was
[11:25.560 --> 11:32.880]  carbon dioxide and water vapor is what comes out of the top of our clean stacks and then
[11:32.880 --> 11:38.600]  the distillation in the scrubbers, those big buildings you see built on that look like
[11:38.600 --> 11:45.600]  many cities to the coal plants, those are the scrubbers and they're creating distillates
[11:45.600 --> 11:53.120]  for alloys and steel and plastics and material for your highways and just it all gets used,
[11:53.120 --> 11:59.280]  it all gets used, that's what our incredible scientist in Germany, in France, in England,
[11:59.280 --> 12:03.800]  the United States, in Scotland and in other areas of the world, the Japanese have developed
[12:03.800 --> 12:13.680]  a lot of stuff, that's what the technology has deployed and now Trump with one fell
[12:13.680 --> 12:23.000]  swoop has come in and not just said oh this deal isn't the best for us or oh the science
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.560]  isn't proven, he said it's a total fraud meant to sell out our country and deindustrialize
[12:27.560 --> 12:31.680]  us because the globalist made deals with China and others and this is all part of a larger
[12:31.680 --> 12:39.640]  global government plan to render the United States basically impotent and servile and
[12:39.640 --> 12:44.800]  Trump said we're getting out, he said I'm all for clean energy here in the United States
[12:44.800 --> 12:48.960]  but is clean energy something that doesn't put out carbon dioxide, they're also saying
[12:48.960 --> 12:57.440]  oh he's wrong with science, he doesn't know what a big deal a 0.2 increase in temperature
[12:57.440 --> 13:04.720]  is or what a tenth of a percent increase in carbon dioxide is, ladies and gentlemen, carbon
[13:04.720 --> 13:09.720]  dioxide according to ice cores and mud samples and others, you look this up yourself, has
[13:09.720 --> 13:18.240]  been over 1,000 times higher than it was now back say during the Jurassic period but we
[13:18.240 --> 13:23.480]  know just going back to mud samples from 20, 30,000 years ago that it was 50, 60 times
[13:23.480 --> 13:29.120]  depending on what period, the truth is most real climatologists are seriously concerned
[13:29.120 --> 13:34.600]  about why the earth is the lowest level of carbon dioxide ever recorded going back about
[13:34.600 --> 13:39.480]  100 years ago, it's boosted because of the industrial revolution a tiny bit but almost
[13:39.480 --> 13:46.840]  unreadable, it's almost like God put all this carbon in the earth so that I guess right
[13:46.840 --> 13:54.640]  around the time our species developed that then we would have access to the carbon we
[13:54.640 --> 14:00.320]  need to basically terraform our own planet or geoengineer it right as we were losing
[14:00.320 --> 14:05.320]  our atmosphere and Mars lost its atmosphere, they've confirmed there's water under the
[14:05.320 --> 14:10.880]  surface, big rivers, big valleys, it was covered with water, now it only has a small southern
[14:10.880 --> 14:19.320]  and northern ice cap, oh ice caps, I was sitting there with a family member this morning because
[14:19.320 --> 14:25.240]  I'd been out in the street carrying the trash cans out and the neighbor had come over and
[14:25.240 --> 14:31.560]  said what do you think of the Trump pulling out of the climate, a lot of people are upset
[14:31.560 --> 14:36.720]  and I said well it's nothing but a global tax and it's not fairly apportioned, only
[14:36.720 --> 14:42.320]  the West has to do it and they said yes but aren't you worried about rising temperatures
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.760]  and I said do you remember how it used to be there's going to be an ice age in the 80s
[14:46.760 --> 14:53.080]  then it's going to be global warming in the 90s and 2000s and now it's just climate change
[14:53.080 --> 14:59.200]  and they didn't seem to get that either so I sat there and I said oh I see you have your
[14:59.200 --> 15:08.120]  smart phone in your top pocket, do me a favor, type in ice caps have gotten larger or Antarctic
[15:08.120 --> 15:15.960]  has gotten larger, he typed it in, we can do this right now, let's do this on Google
[15:15.960 --> 15:21.680]  or whatever banger we want to use, just type in Antarctic ice caps at record level and
[15:21.680 --> 15:32.400]  you know what the top two links are, it's NASA and it's shots is Antarctic and it shows
[15:32.400 --> 15:40.880]  that it's grown the most ever and it shows that it is expanding and it's thicker than
[15:40.880 --> 15:44.840]  ever recorded, now that was the first article I sent Nico this morning and asked him to
[15:44.840 --> 15:50.400]  have the guys post on M4 because that's the first link, if you're watching us on TV let's
[15:50.400 --> 15:57.320]  go back to the top, the first link if you type in is flashback, NASA study mass gains
[15:57.320 --> 16:07.080]  in Arctic ice sheet greater than losses that was 2015, NASA.gov but there's another report
[16:07.080 --> 16:15.520]  from the same year, another one the next year, Antarctic ice sheet the largest it's ever
[16:15.520 --> 16:22.000]  been recorded, that's the second link in the NASA file and by the way these are temperature
[16:22.000 --> 16:29.880]  readings from satellites, these are temperature readings from the ground, these are space scans,
[16:29.880 --> 16:36.080]  these are ground scans, these are scans from aircraft and this is topography scans down
[16:36.080 --> 16:42.520]  to a millimeter showing how the continent of Antarctica has grown at record levels and
[16:42.520 --> 16:51.760]  they have time lapse satellite composites of it growing, now about 2013 in 2006 Al Gore
[16:51.760 --> 16:58.320]  said it was going to be melted and look they know this is all a fraud, there it is, Antarctic
[16:58.320 --> 17:06.080]  sea ice reaches new record maximum, record maximum the year after Al Gore said it would
[17:06.080 --> 17:13.560]  melt and by the way those are old articles, Antarctic is growing even faster now and may
[17:13.560 --> 17:21.480]  they're worried touch the tip of South America for parts of the year and close the sea lanes,
[17:21.480 --> 17:27.160]  that's right that's never been recorded where the sea lanes between the tip of South America
[17:27.160 --> 17:37.040]  and Chile and Antarctica the southern continent the no man's land, no nation makes claim to
[17:37.040 --> 17:42.560]  it like Mars or the moon might as well be, it's growing so fast that in some months of
[17:42.560 --> 17:53.480]  the winter it is feared that by February of April of next year it could seal the southern
[17:53.480 --> 18:01.840]  passage but see Al Gore is brainwashing your kids with movies he makes showing cartoon graphics
[18:01.840 --> 18:10.920]  of polar bears drowning, polar bears that can't swim when their numbers are up five
[18:10.920 --> 18:17.120]  fold from 1954, look it up yourself, you can search that as well, so this entire world
[18:17.120 --> 18:23.200]  government fiasco by the Rothschild, NM Rothschild bank and the globalist to set up global
[18:23.200 --> 18:28.800]  100 trillion per decade carbon taxes to track and trace everything we do, Trump comes out
[18:28.800 --> 18:39.120]  and annihilates it but then I had another debate with somebody today in my family they
[18:39.120 --> 18:42.000]  were really concerned they said well yeah I mean I understand that you know they're
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.960]  cutting some carbon here but not in other countries but shouldn't we do something and
[18:45.960 --> 18:50.480]  I said it doesn't do anything when carbon dioxide is what we need and when the real
[18:50.480 --> 18:57.480]  threat is GMO, genetic engineering, chimeras, nuclear weapons, fission fusion, Hadron reactors,
[18:57.480 --> 19:02.840]  strangelets, any matter weapons which they admit the Pentagon has developed, it's those
[19:02.840 --> 19:07.400]  laboratories that you've got to worry about and I'm not against technology I'm saying
[19:07.400 --> 19:11.280]  we're moving towards the Atlantean moment where we create technology so powerful and
[19:11.280 --> 19:16.920]  don't know what we're doing instead of blowing up the laboratory with a you know chemistry
[19:16.920 --> 19:21.160]  test you blow up a whole continent or maybe the whole world or the whole solar system
[19:21.160 --> 19:29.480]  who knows 1900 equations that gave us atomic bombs in 1945, who knows what they've got
[19:29.480 --> 19:38.600]  now that's this whole breakaway civilization issue, when I come back we've got our reporters
[19:38.600 --> 19:44.560]  at Bilderberg, we've got James Leslie Rawls of Big News, James O'Keefe's being sued, remember
[19:44.560 --> 19:48.400]  he exposed the Democrats admitting how they were going to engage in election theft and
[19:48.400 --> 19:51.840]  stuff while they're just suing him now, I guess that's a message to anybody, don't
[19:51.840 --> 19:56.840]  expose what we're doing or we'll sue you, Mike Cernovich has got Big News, George Webb
[19:56.840 --> 20:25.840]  and more, so much today, I'm Alex Shones and FullWars.com.
[20:25.840 --> 20:54.840]  I'm Alex Shones, I'm Mike Cernovich, I'm Mike Cernovich, I'm Mike Cernovich, I'm Mike
[20:54.840 --> 20:59.520]  Cernovich, I'm Mike Cernovich.
[21:24.840 --> 21:28.760]  undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really
[21:28.760 --> 21:33.000]  memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.960]  but took action. We have over a thousand high-quality products available that
[21:36.960 --> 21:41.400]  are discounted at m4store.com. You add auto-ship, several of these are lost

[22:01.320 --> 22:06.080]  control of your own health care is freedom from insurance. Become part of a
[22:06.080 --> 22:10.080]  group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical
[22:10.080 --> 22:15.800]  expenses. Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[22:15.800 --> 22:19.160]  Choose from three health sharing programs. Holistic treatments may be
[22:19.160 --> 22:23.120]  eligible for sharing. See guidelines. Discount programs available for dental,
[22:23.120 --> 22:29.480]  vision, and pharmacy. Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.
[22:29.480 --> 22:33.640]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon. I'm talking thick meaty, center-cut,
[22:33.640 --> 22:39.160]  presidential bacon. Savory and delicious. I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[22:39.160 --> 22:44.600]  Awesome. No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life. NASA PAC technology.
[22:44.600 --> 22:49.400]  Bacon. Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the PAC bacon. Or

[23:00.800 --> 23:05.600]  society is only three missed meals away from chaos. Those times may be near.
[23:05.600 --> 23:08.960]  Think about it. Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and
[23:08.960 --> 23:13.160]  aggressions from Russia and North Korea. Social unrest and violent marches yet
[23:13.160 --> 23:16.960]  again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns. And our crumbling
[23:16.960 --> 23:20.480]  infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a
[23:20.480 --> 23:24.640]  single cyber attack. When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the
[23:24.640 --> 23:29.000]  government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency. That's
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.120]  why you need your own plan for self-reliance. That's where my Patriot

[24:18.400 --> 24:23.040]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I want to get into what Trump's historic
[24:23.040 --> 24:28.440]  speech and actions mean yesterday, directing the federal agencies to stop
[24:28.440 --> 24:37.040]  enforcing the Paris Climate Accord, which Obama has been enforcing since he got
[24:37.040 --> 24:42.520]  into office. See, Obama couldn't get Congress to ratify the carbon taxes. The
[24:42.520 --> 24:47.080]  first year in the second year he got in, he failed. But then the Supreme Court
[24:47.080 --> 24:53.360]  ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency could implement basically
[24:53.360 --> 24:57.000]  anything it wanted through executive orders of the president outside of law,
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.320]  or that they could basically make extra legislative law, their own new branch of
[25:02.320 --> 25:11.920]  government, a second legislative system. And so for seven years we've been under
[25:11.920 --> 25:18.640]  de facto carbon taxes. But they're not fully implemented. They could just shut
[25:18.640 --> 25:22.360]  down your coal plant, but not shut down GE. So GE would make more money, they
[25:22.360 --> 25:25.840]  would give more campaign contributions, or they could send regulators to your
[25:25.840 --> 25:31.240]  factory, but not to somebody else's that made the payoffs. Remember right when
[25:31.240 --> 25:35.840]  Obama got elected? There were Chevy dealerships all over the country that
[25:35.840 --> 25:42.800]  were Republican donors. And so Obama, once the government took over, General
[25:42.800 --> 25:48.720]  Motors literally took hundreds and hundreds of dealerships away and gave
[25:48.720 --> 25:58.120]  them to Democrats. I mean, think of the mobster, gangster, third world picking
[25:58.120 --> 26:03.160]  winners, picking losers system. That's what wrecked Venezuela. That's what wrecked
[26:03.160 --> 26:08.880]  Argentina. That's what wrecked Nigeria. Because once you get a country that
[26:08.880 --> 26:12.520]  operates like that, it's over. That's what's been wrecking Russia forever. And
[26:12.520 --> 26:17.320]  Putin is, credit's been trying to stop that and bring in free market. And that's
[26:17.320 --> 26:20.840]  why the globalists want to shut Russia down, because if Russia ever brings in
[26:20.840 --> 26:27.800]  real free market, they got two Americas to deal with. You turn the entrepreneur
[26:27.800 --> 26:31.840]  loose, you turn real competition loose, you get more choices, you get falling
[26:31.840 --> 26:38.600]  prices, you get spoiled rotten kids. That's the problem. Prosperity makes
[26:38.600 --> 26:45.480]  monsters. Adversity makes men. So it's a paradox. Then you can argue, well, they've
[26:45.480 --> 26:48.800]  had a lot of adversity in Venezuela. They should be really free now. Well, it's
[26:48.800 --> 26:55.120]  it's a cycle. And a lot of countries ever get out of the cycle. But you look at
[26:55.120 --> 27:09.080]  millennials, smart, focused in many cases, but they just can't handle criticism. We
[27:09.080 --> 27:14.680]  all spoil our children too much, don't we? Hell, I'm spoiled compared to a lot of my
[27:14.680 --> 27:18.880]  ancestors. But Trump is a throwback and it's just trying to bring back basic
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.440]  competition. And that's why they're so angry. This devastated world government
[27:23.440 --> 27:31.640]  so bad it makes my head spin. Here's an NBC headline the left is banding about.
[27:31.640 --> 27:40.560]  Did Trump, Kushner and Sessions have an undisclosed meeting with a Russian? Oh my
[27:40.560 --> 27:47.800]  gosh. Al Franken, the comedian's got some more fiction for us. There's a Mayflower
[27:47.800 --> 27:52.480]  hotel. They're trying to say Trump was in the hotel at the same time at some big
[27:52.480 --> 27:56.360]  dinner convention and that that's an undisclosed meeting. How about they go,
[27:56.360 --> 28:00.680]  oh, Sessions got caught lying. He didn't put on his forms for national security
[28:00.680 --> 28:04.040]  clearance, which he already had the Senate as attorney general that he met
[28:04.040 --> 28:08.000]  with the Russian ambassador because the FBI told him you don't put that on the
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.880]  form. You're a separate branch of government. Of course, you're on the
[28:10.880 --> 28:16.680]  Senate, armed services and intelligence committees. You don't fill that out
[28:16.680 --> 28:20.040]  because it's not a connection to a foreign power because it's under your
[28:20.040 --> 28:26.200]  job. But they put that out. Oh, he, he, he, he met with the Russians and didn't
[28:26.200 --> 28:31.520]  say it. He put it on the forms. The FBI, the Justice Department told him you
[28:31.520 --> 28:35.640]  don't do that. And he already knew that he was being extra careful, but they
[28:35.640 --> 28:41.640]  play games at every level. Oh my gosh, Trump might meet with Putin. If he does
[28:41.640 --> 28:47.040]  that, we know he's a risky agent. Just like the fake FBI memo from Comey.
[28:47.040 --> 28:50.760]  Notice you don't hear about that anymore. Just put it out. Say it shows all this.
[28:50.760 --> 28:53.600]  When it turns out it's not real, just forget about it. Don't supply it to
[28:53.600 --> 28:59.640]  Congress because Comey testified two months after that meeting when that memo
[28:59.640 --> 29:03.440]  supposedly was created that Trump or no one else ever tried to influence him.
[29:03.440 --> 29:07.600]  But here it is. Did Trump Kushner Sessions have an undisclosed meeting with
[29:07.600 --> 29:13.600]  a Russian? Dun, dun, dun. A Spanish Inquisition, more like the Russian
[29:13.600 --> 29:20.200]  Inquisition. Dun, dun, dun. The FBI and Congress are examining a campaign event
[29:20.200 --> 29:23.680]  last spring during which Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions, and Jared Kushner were in
[29:23.680 --> 29:28.040]  a small gathering with Russian Ambassador of the U.S. and other diplomats at
[29:28.040 --> 29:30.920]  Washington's Mayflower Hotel. Oh my gosh, they were once at a meeting with a bunch
[29:30.920 --> 29:34.880]  of diplomats. Oh my gosh, you can't do that. Five current former U.S. officials
[29:34.880 --> 29:38.920]  said they were aware of classified intelligence, suggesting, oh, suggesting
[29:38.920 --> 29:42.840]  there was some sort of private encounter between Trump and his aides at the
[29:42.840 --> 29:48.200]  Russian Envoy. Oh, see? You know, Hillary's meeting secretly with Putin, doing
[29:48.200 --> 29:54.560]  Iranian deals, all that's okay. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex

[30:01.040 --> 30:06.680]  Bilderberg 2017 is kicking off in Chantilly, Virginia this year. This is the
[30:06.680 --> 30:10.040]  first Bilderberg meeting since the populist uprisings of Brexit and the
[30:10.040 --> 30:13.520]  Trump election have come to pass, and the elites now see their power base
[30:13.520 --> 30:17.600]  crumbling before their very eyes. Among some of the subjects of the secret
[30:17.600 --> 30:22.400]  confab will be the Trump administration, and can he be healed? Also, the rise of
[30:22.400 --> 30:26.640]  populism. Elites are beginning to fear that their power base may be crumbling.
[30:26.640 --> 30:29.680]  Now, three members of the current Trump administration are going to be
[30:29.680 --> 30:34.440]  attending, HR McMaster, Wilbur Ross and Chris Liddell. Most Trump insiders
[30:34.440 --> 30:38.440]  believe that these three are there to help the elites derail the current
[30:38.440 --> 30:41.880]  administration. There are two ways at which this can go. Either the Globals
[30:41.880 --> 30:45.560]  will try to bring Trump to heel, or they will try to impeach him after the 2018
[30:45.560 --> 30:48.880]  election. You can read more about this and exclusive Bilderberg schemes to
[30:48.880 --> 30:53.840]  overthrow Trump on infowars.com. And ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up

[31:02.680 --> 31:06.040]  filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're
[31:06.040 --> 31:10.000]  breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates of the
[31:10.000 --> 31:15.280]  chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based
[31:15.280 --> 31:19.400]  right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water
[31:19.400 --> 31:23.800]  filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze. Whether it's your
[31:23.800 --> 31:27.600]  home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your
[31:27.600 --> 31:32.080]  children to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters
[31:32.080 --> 31:36.040]  at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or
[31:36.040 --> 31:41.160]  avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't. The
[31:41.160 --> 31:45.800]  Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems
[31:45.800 --> 31:49.840]  can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally
[31:49.840 --> 31:53.160]  putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters
[31:53.160 --> 31:57.560]  that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary

[32:04.240 --> 32:09.320]  seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to
[32:09.320 --> 32:13.200]  our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in
[32:13.200 --> 32:17.080]  many cases give the ultimate sacrifice. That's what this holiday and
[32:17.080 --> 32:20.920]  remembrance is all about. It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the
[32:20.920 --> 32:24.840]  belief they were building a better world. This group of specials for 2017
[32:24.840 --> 32:28.280]  Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items
[32:28.280 --> 32:32.680]  because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on
[32:32.680 --> 32:36.600]  the line and didn't talk but took action. We have over a thousand high quality

[33:18.840 --> 33:22.000]  I'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders
[33:22.000 --> 33:30.280]  to either negotiate our way back into Paris under the terms that are fair to
[33:30.280 --> 33:37.920]  the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our
[33:37.920 --> 33:40.000]  country and its taxpayers.
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.000]  So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.880]  non obstructionists. We will all sit down and we will get back into the deal and
[33:54.880 --> 33:59.240]  we'll make it good and we won't be closing up our factories and we won't be
[33:59.240 --> 34:05.280]  losing our jobs and we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that
[34:05.280 --> 34:09.360]  represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much
[34:09.360 --> 34:14.400]  better than the Paris Accord and I think the people of our country will be
[34:14.400 --> 34:17.720]  thrilled and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled but until we
[34:17.720 --> 34:24.320]  do that we're out of the agreement. I will work to ensure that America remains
[34:24.320 --> 34:30.040]  the world's leader on environmental issues but under a firm work that is
[34:30.040 --> 34:37.720]  fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among
[34:37.720 --> 34:46.520]  the many nations all around the world. No responsible leader can put the
[34:46.520 --> 34:55.720]  workers and the people of their country at this debilitating and tremendous
[34:55.720 --> 35:02.160]  disadvantage. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States while
[35:02.160 --> 35:09.520]  empowering some of the world's top polluting countries should dispel any
[35:09.520 --> 35:16.920]  doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificence
[35:16.920 --> 35:24.240]  in country tied up and bound down by this agreement. It's to give their country
[35:24.240 --> 35:28.920]  an economic edge over the United States. That's not going to happen while I'm
[35:28.920 --> 35:33.720]  president I'm sorry. My job as president is to do everything within my power to
[35:33.720 --> 35:42.000]  give America a level playing field and to create the economic regulatory and tax
[35:42.000 --> 35:48.960]  structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on
[35:48.960 --> 35:57.320]  earth and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of
[35:57.320 --> 36:09.360]  environmental protection. Our tax bill is moving along in Congress and I believe
[36:09.360 --> 36:13.760]  it's doing very well. I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.
[36:13.760 --> 36:19.120]  The Republicans are working very very hard. We'd love to have support from the
[36:19.120 --> 36:25.720]  Democrats but we may have to go it alone but it's going very well. The Paris
[36:25.720 --> 36:32.600]  Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the
[36:32.600 --> 36:38.520]  very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain
[36:38.520 --> 36:49.360]  wealth at our country's expense. They don't put America first. I do and I always
[36:49.360 --> 37:00.520]  will. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that
[37:00.520 --> 37:08.080]  have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade
[37:08.080 --> 37:15.560]  practices and in many cases lacks contributions to our critical military
[37:15.560 --> 37:20.600]  alliance. You see what's happening. It's pretty obvious to those that want to
[37:20.600 --> 37:28.760]  keep an open mind. At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do
[37:28.760 --> 37:34.880]  they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens
[37:34.880 --> 37:42.520]  and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. Right. We don't want other
[37:42.520 --> 37:48.400]  leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore and they won't be. They won't
[37:48.400 --> 38:00.440]  be. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris. That's
[38:00.440 --> 38:05.080]  why they hate him so much. He literally represents America. He literally is
[38:05.080 --> 38:10.040]  trying to bring us prosperity. He literally is open and free and got a
[38:10.040 --> 38:14.480]  rainbow flag at the convention saying I don't hate anybody. You ever seen a
[38:14.480 --> 38:19.520]  Republican do that? And so the liberal gay groups hating more than ever
[38:19.520 --> 38:25.760]  because they're bought and paid for by Soros. I don't dislike gay people at all.
[38:25.760 --> 38:30.880]  Neither does Trump. It's that I dislike the ones that say you don't like me if
[38:30.880 --> 38:37.320]  you don't turn in your guns and have high taxes and I'm like no. The left is a
[38:37.320 --> 38:40.520]  consortium of people that want to conquer everybody else that want to run
[38:40.520 --> 38:44.280]  our lives. Finally the left even gets it. This thing that happened last week is
[38:44.280 --> 38:48.800]  finally in the New York Times. When the left turns on its own, Brent Weinstein,
[38:48.800 --> 38:52.840]  the biology professor is a big social justice warrior, big liberal, uses all
[38:52.840 --> 38:56.520]  the weird binary terms and all of it, but he said you shouldn't have a weekend
[38:56.520 --> 39:01.160]  where no whites are allowed on campus. That's that's that's discriminatory. They
[39:01.160 --> 39:06.240]  said oh you need to be fired. He's got death threats, you name it. And now all
[39:06.240 --> 39:11.680]  the crazy KKK style minorities, which is just the same as the KKK, whacked out.
[39:11.680 --> 39:14.640]  They believe they're in the right. They believe they've been wrong. They're
[39:14.640 --> 39:20.480]  flipping out on him. And some mainstream media is going well is it really a big
[39:20.480 --> 39:24.880]  deal? Even the New York Post yesterday was like they're making a big deal out of
[39:24.880 --> 39:30.760]  this, but you know. Is it a big deal? So what? We have some days where whites can't
[39:30.760 --> 39:35.320]  come on campus. That's literally going back to pre-Martin Luther King, but this
[39:35.320 --> 39:41.600]  is what they're doing. They want cults of controllable people. Because if we have a
[39:41.600 --> 39:47.640]  culture based on free market and upward mobility and the Renaissance and choices
[39:47.640 --> 39:54.720]  and free society, the tyrants can't have their world technocracy. Like Obama said,
[39:54.720 --> 40:01.520]  you can't have a car. You can't have air conditioning. If you do the Earth will
[40:01.520 --> 40:05.280]  boil over. I'm going to fly and land on a jumbo jet because I'm the elite, but you
[40:05.280 --> 40:08.480]  can't have anything. Not we're going to have cleaner technology. Not no, no.
[40:08.480 --> 40:12.360]  They're saying you need to be poor to save the earth. Okay? You just stay right
[40:12.360 --> 40:18.640]  there and die. We're going to go to Troyer who's in Chantilly, Virginia in a moment
[40:18.640 --> 40:25.160]  at Bilderberg 2017. But before I go any further, we are Lister supported. And now
[40:25.160 --> 40:30.240]  more than ever, we're trying to build our own economy. We're trying to launch a
[40:30.240 --> 40:37.320]  TV, you know, basically network. I had live transmissions 18 hours a day or so.
[40:37.320 --> 40:40.640]  We're starting launching shows the next month and a half, the next six months go
[40:40.640 --> 40:46.040]  live about 18 hours a day. But that takes your support and we make it easy. We
[40:46.040 --> 40:48.960]  have a Memorial Day special that I'm now calling the beginning of summer special
[40:48.960 --> 40:51.440]  that we're extending through the weekend. But then we got to stop with some
[40:51.440 --> 40:57.520]  stuff about to sell out 30% off SuperMail Vitality, 65% off
[40:57.520 --> 41:04.760]  Colloidal Silver Silver Bullet, Rainforest 47% off retail, Secret 12, 43% off
[41:04.760 --> 41:09.880]  retail, knock out the amazing sleep aid normally 1995. It's 995 folks. That is
[41:09.880 --> 41:13.560]  such an insane deal. That is almost a lost leader. And it's just got the L
[41:13.560 --> 41:17.440]  tryptophan. It's got the valerian root. It's got the melatonin. All the regular
[41:17.440 --> 41:22.560]  dosages you'd buy, you know, at the drugstore or at the vitamin store, nine
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.600]  different bottles for like 15, 20, $30 a piece. You get them all the same dose
[41:26.600 --> 41:33.800]  organic for 995. No one can top this. I've talked about my great lawyer whose
[41:33.800 --> 41:38.440]  name's on the family code. They're in Texas, Randy Wilhite, who's been on four
[41:38.440 --> 41:41.400]  different drugs, sleep studies, very private guy. He said I could tell you
[41:41.400 --> 41:45.680]  the story was ruining his life because for years he made himself stay up all
[41:45.680 --> 41:49.120]  night. Used to be racehorse Haines, his main lawyer, been a very famous criminal
[41:49.120 --> 41:52.680]  lawyer as well. He trained himself to stay up all night sometimes for days just
[41:52.680 --> 42:01.280]  on coffee. And his brain kind of got killed for that. And he's a, you know,
[42:01.280 --> 42:05.280]  handsome guy, big guy. I mean, he doesn't look bad, but he looks 10 years younger
[42:05.280 --> 42:10.320]  on knockout for taking it six months ago. He takes one and now sleeps like a
[42:10.320 --> 42:16.480]  baby. It's changed his whole life, his whole life. He had to learn to cut that
[42:16.480 --> 42:21.400]  client so he's not, you know, up overnight. He's a UT professor as well. But I'm
[42:21.400 --> 42:25.160]  going to get him to come in sometime and just do a testimonial because this is
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.080]  one of the products I'm proud of because I had the idea. 1995 for a bottle of
[42:29.080 --> 42:32.240]  melatonin, someone's having trouble sleeping. And I was looking at the dosage
[42:32.240 --> 42:34.840]  and then I looked into private labeling and I found out we could do it for like
[42:34.840 --> 42:39.400]  $2 a bottle. Now when everybody's selling it for $19 and it's like $2 for the
[42:39.400 --> 42:43.800]  product, the bottle, and then the bottle's like 30 cents. So I said for like, you
[42:43.800 --> 42:46.320]  know, two and a half dollars or less, this is what it is. I said, well, how much
[42:46.320 --> 42:49.440]  is L-tryptophan? How much is Valerian root? How much? And they were all so
[42:49.440 --> 42:54.960]  inexpensive compounds that I could bottle it for like, you know, eight bucks a
[42:54.960 --> 43:03.200]  bottle, sell it for $9.95 and dominate everyone else. Now something like DNA
[43:03.200 --> 43:09.760]  Force, we're talking $40,000 or more a kilo just for the
[43:09.760 --> 43:13.400]  BioPQQ. We have the very best from the Japanese made America. Just looking at
[43:13.400 --> 43:17.440]  BioPQQ or CoQ10. This is not the synthetic crap. DNA Force, you know,
[43:17.440 --> 43:20.680]  costs 130 bucks when we've got it because it's usually sold out. Zach can't
[43:20.680 --> 43:24.440]  ever get all the super high-quality nutraceutical compounds. So something
[43:24.440 --> 43:28.000]  like that where a bottle is costing us 60 bucks, you know, we're gonna, we're gonna
[43:28.000 --> 43:35.320]  have 100% markup. But these are all the very best products out there. All Trump
[43:35.320 --> 43:42.400]  shirts are at cost 75% off. Infowarslife.com or AAA 2533139 and it is your

[44:18.280 --> 44:21.560]  top three brands in the country, organic. We have the mouthwash, 10 to 1
[44:21.560 --> 44:25.080]  concentrate, all of it. The deodorant is amazing. All of it's organic, doesn't
[44:25.080 --> 44:31.160]  have the metals in it. The sunscreen is the non-nanosink. Non-nanosink, so it's
[44:31.160 --> 44:36.800]  healthy. This is the very best product, 20% off retail and limited time. It's gonna

[45:10.280 --> 45:16.320]  support our local affiliates as well, their local sponsors. Okay. Joining us
[45:16.320 --> 45:20.320]  from Chantilly, Virginia, we'll talk to David Knight later in the broadcast, Owen
[45:20.320 --> 45:23.720]  Schreuer and the team are there for the Bilderberg meeting, which they didn't
[45:23.720 --> 45:27.640]  admit it existed just 10 years ago. They're there meeting, world leaders are
[45:27.640 --> 45:30.860]  meeting in secret and admittedly because some of the people that are there are in
[45:30.860 --> 45:34.160]  public saying they want to overthrow Trump. The Jarvan papers are saying FU to
[45:34.160 --> 45:37.760]  overthrow Trump. Junker's promising a trade war to overthrow Trump. So Owen
[45:37.760 --> 45:41.200]  Schreuer, you're there. They've been denying globalism exists, private world
[45:41.200 --> 45:45.440]  government, their carbon tax, but now it's all being annihilated right in front
[45:45.440 --> 45:50.200]  of us. What a time to be there while world governments in crisis. Yeah, it's a
[45:50.200 --> 45:54.400]  pretty just incredible time to be alive period. We're undergoing so many changes
[45:54.400 --> 45:58.360]  right now for humanity. We decide whether we have a corporate world
[45:58.360 --> 46:02.240]  government that will determine our future or if sovereign nations and sovereign
[46:02.240 --> 46:05.400]  citizens will be able to determine our future. And the people who are meeting
[46:05.400 --> 46:08.920]  right behind us, well, Alex, you know what they want? They want corporate
[46:08.920 --> 46:13.360]  control. They want to get out ahead of the human advancement so that they can
[46:13.360 --> 46:17.720]  implement their control grid before humanity actually catches up to the
[46:17.720 --> 46:22.520]  technology that they have already. But you said something earlier, Alex,
[46:22.520 --> 46:28.320]  that's really key here. And I try to instill this in people's minds about
[46:28.320 --> 46:32.760]  what's happening at Bilderberg and about President Trump. Whether you like
[46:32.760 --> 46:37.680]  President Donald Trump or not is irrelevant. President Donald Trump is
[46:37.680 --> 46:43.240]  an American president. He represents the American people. Whatever agendas,
[46:43.240 --> 46:51.360]  whatever goals he has, he's acting as an American. He's not being diluted or
[46:51.360 --> 46:56.160]  he's not being controlled by foreign operatives, by banks or any of this.
[46:56.160 --> 47:01.240]  He's acting for a sovereign nation of America. And whether you like President
[47:01.240 --> 47:05.680]  Trump or not, you should at least be willing to get behind that for the
[47:05.680 --> 47:09.040]  first time we're having a president who actually cares about America and not
[47:09.040 --> 47:12.600]  as willing to sell out to the globalist. Why can't Americans at least get
[47:12.600 --> 47:15.640]  behind that? Well, they don't even know that globalism exists. And Alex, we
[47:15.640 --> 47:19.880]  went out on the streets in Herndon yesterday and I talked to about 20
[47:19.880 --> 47:24.840]  individuals, I think about 16 or 17 of them, never even heard of
[47:24.840 --> 47:28.400]  Bilderberg. You can see in the videos, when I'm talking to them, they think
[47:28.400 --> 47:32.320]  I'm crazy. They're like, oh, yeah, if that actually exists, you're probably
[47:32.320 --> 47:35.880]  just making that up. But if that exists, and I'm like, Hey, bro, I literally
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.000]  just left. I was just there. It definitely, you know why they do that? Oh,
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.520]  and because on the Simpsons and countless other shows, they for like 20
[47:43.520 --> 47:46.720]  years, they go Bilderberg. You mean Bilderberger? That's like the weird
[47:46.720 --> 47:51.360]  counter to royalty world leaders meeting in secret. Admittedly, congressional
[47:51.360 --> 47:55.680]  documents have been leaked to us, where it shows it's all secret, a plan for a
[47:55.680 --> 48:00.040]  world government. They created the EU. This is the major power brokers. This is
[48:00.040 --> 48:04.240]  where Hillary and Obama met in 2008. She decided to step down. That's now been
[48:04.240 --> 48:08.160]  admitted. I was there calling national media saying, you're looking for
[48:08.160 --> 48:11.760]  Hillary. She's been missing for a day with Obama. Here she is. They didn't
[48:11.760 --> 48:14.880]  want to hear it because they were so controlled. You know, speaking of
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.320]  national media, Alex, I haven't seen any national media out here. I've been, I've
[48:20.320 --> 48:24.800]  been tuning in intermittently to mainstream news just to see if they're
[48:24.800 --> 48:30.320]  covering this. No, complete radio silence. Even Lindsey Graham goes on Fox News
[48:30.320 --> 48:34.080]  this morning, does an interview for a whole segment, at least 10 minutes. You
[48:34.080 --> 48:38.160]  know how many times Bilderberg got brought up? Zero times. Lindsey Graham is a
[48:38.160 --> 48:42.040]  regular Bilderberger attendee. You're not even gonna ask him about Bilderberg.
[48:42.040 --> 48:45.560]  You're not even gonna ask him about what they're talking about as far as their
[48:45.560 --> 48:49.600]  number one agenda this year, which is addressing the president of the United
[48:49.600 --> 48:53.680]  States plan to make America great again. Donald Trump, nothing from Fox News on
[48:53.680 --> 48:57.120]  that. So I don't even know if they know what's going on. Maybe they don't even
[48:57.120 --> 49:00.040]  know what's going on. Alex, maybe their head is still in the clouds and they
[49:00.040 --> 49:04.760]  don't even know that Bilderberg is going on. But it's amazing to think that just
[49:04.760 --> 49:09.760]  like you said, 10 years ago, they said this event doesn't happen. This conference
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.480]  doesn't exist. Now they just put it out in the public and it's almost like
[49:13.480 --> 49:17.560]  because they're public now, nobody wants to talk about it. Oh, because it's just a
[49:17.560 --> 49:20.040]  public meeting. There's nothing to see here. It's just a public meeting. There's
[49:20.040 --> 49:24.280]  no reason to cover this. Oh, really? Let's see. There's about 20 security guards
[49:24.280 --> 49:28.480]  sitting behind me. I had four patty wagons come in in the last 20 minutes.
[49:28.480 --> 49:31.600]  Well, let's be clear. Those are local security guards. Those are police. They've got
[49:31.600 --> 49:35.960]  SWAT teams. They've got Marines and plain clothes. Go ahead. Well, and I just want
[49:35.960 --> 49:40.160]  to say the confrontations that I've had with the security officers here, they're
[49:40.160 --> 49:43.600]  very nice people. They seem like they're just American citizens, just like you or
[49:43.600 --> 49:46.880]  I, and they're just out here doing their job. Most of them are listeners. I've talked
[49:46.880 --> 49:52.200]  to a bunch of them. Yeah. Yeah. But you can tell that again, you just have to ask
[49:52.200 --> 49:59.160]  yourself, if there is this group of elites having this meeting and their elite,
[49:59.160 --> 50:02.360]  their experience, they have all these successes and accomplishments, right?
[50:02.360 --> 50:05.240]  They're trying to help humanity. That's why they're having this meeting. Well, why
[50:05.240 --> 50:09.280]  do it behind closed doors? Why not do it live on Facebook? Why not do it live on
[50:09.280 --> 50:14.040]  YouTube? Why not do it live on Periscope? Why not put out videos? They
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.040]  denied back when Phyllis Schlafly didn't even know the name and was exposing it
[50:18.040 --> 50:22.680]  from her Washington contacts in the 50s. They said she was crazy. And then they
[50:22.680 --> 50:26.520]  had another reporter, Peggler, Westbrook Peggler. And then, of course, there was
[50:26.520 --> 50:32.280]  the great writer for so many years or just out a few years ago. You know, God
[50:32.280 --> 50:40.120]  bless his soul from the American Free Press, Tucker. You've got all this
[50:40.120 --> 50:44.240]  happening and they're just denying it exists. And then now it is out in the
[50:44.240 --> 50:47.000]  open and world government's out in the open and George Soros is out in the open,
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.680]  that they're unelected. It's unaccountable that the carbon tax is
[50:49.680 --> 50:53.240]  unelected, unaccountable, that the EU is unelected, unaccountable. I mean, who
[50:53.240 --> 50:58.000]  made John Claude Yonkers, you know, ruler of the world of the unelected EU? It's a
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.120]  big day. We'll come back to Owen. It's a no-brainer. A big Berkey water filter is
[51:03.120 --> 51:06.160]  the one you need, period. You need a water filter that removes chlorine,
[51:06.160 --> 51:10.080]  fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides,
[51:10.080 --> 51:13.840]  bacteria, viruses, and much more, right? And does it all at only two cents per
[51:13.840 --> 51:17.400]  gallon. Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big

[51:28.840 --> 51:36.320]  BERKEY. Nearly one-third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees. One-third.
[51:36.320 --> 51:40.440]  There's already been riots across Europe. Is America next? Hi, I'm the owner of
[51:40.440 --> 51:44.440]  Infidel Body Armor. Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor
[51:44.440 --> 51:49.720]  kits and trained hundreds of sheep dogs. They have prepared. Have you? I invite you

[51:59.600 --> 52:05.920]  In America's 240-plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles
[52:05.920 --> 52:10.240]  at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS
[52:10.240 --> 52:14.160]  today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[52:14.160 --> 52:18.520]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about. It's those that made the
[52:18.520 --> 52:21.880]  ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world. This group
[52:21.880 --> 52:26.600]  of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had

[54:16.360 --> 54:23.240]  We want fair treatment for its citizens and we want fair treatment for our
[54:23.240 --> 54:30.000]  taxpayers. We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us
[54:30.000 --> 54:38.760]  anymore and they won't be. They won't be. I was elected to represent the citizens
[54:38.760 --> 54:43.440]  of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
[54:43.680 --> 54:48.800]  Incredible. I want listeners to sit back and savor this and also thank God
[54:48.800 --> 54:51.800]  because you've been praying. I've been praying. We've been educating you've been
[54:51.800 --> 54:55.880]  getting laughed at by your friends and family for decades. There were patriots
[54:55.880 --> 54:59.560]  going back to the time of Barry Goldwater and Phillip Schlafly who were
[54:59.560 --> 55:04.240]  covering all this and talking about this before they even knew the name. That
[55:04.240 --> 55:08.440]  hey, Washington elite are meeting outside DC in New York and in other cities
[55:08.440 --> 55:11.760]  every year plotting a takeover and they were getting attacked. It's all been
[55:11.760 --> 55:17.400]  proven. So I can't sit here and even take credit for this. Our ancestors did this
[55:17.400 --> 55:22.440]  and the patriots' shoulders we stand on. People like Dr. Ron Paul. I want to
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.120]  salute everybody and Jim Tucker who died a few years ago. A lot of people say,
[55:26.120 --> 55:29.440]  well, why are you still covering it? It's passé. You've proven it exists. No. Now
[55:29.440 --> 55:33.480]  they just want to ignore that it exists as Owen Shroyer just said, Owen, you're
[55:33.480 --> 55:36.600]  reporting from Bilderberg and the rest of this segment the next. Take over and
[55:36.600 --> 55:39.440]  tell us your observations there. And I mean, this is such a big deal. Here's
[55:39.440 --> 55:45.600]  global government camped outside DC. This is an epic moment. Think about this,
[55:45.600 --> 55:50.560]  Alex. Not only is this a meeting of global elites here trying to form a
[55:50.560 --> 55:55.120]  secret shadow global government. It's also very fascistic, right? I mean, it's the
[55:55.120 --> 56:01.040]  definition of fascism. So where's Antifa? I'm sorry, Antifa shows up any time
[56:01.040 --> 56:04.880]  there's a Trump hat or a Trump shirt, but where's Antifa out here when there's an
[56:04.880 --> 56:09.120]  actual fascist meeting happening behind us of a secret world government? No
[56:09.120 --> 56:13.000]  Antifa. I guess George Soros didn't want to pay his little protesters to come out
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.240]  here and protest today, huh? How convenient is that, Alex? And again, it's
[56:17.240 --> 56:20.880]  just worth mentioning there's probably more security guards here than there
[56:20.880 --> 56:25.720]  are protesters or media. They got more security detail out here than actual
[56:25.720 --> 56:28.480]  people and nobody's really trying to penetrate. They're kind of just hanging
[56:28.480 --> 56:31.920]  out. I think that they know that they're not going to get led in. They had to put
[56:31.920 --> 56:36.880]  up. They literally planted new trees, Alex, down this road right here. You used
[56:36.880 --> 56:40.840]  to be able to see the hotel if you were on the road. Well, they didn't like that.
[56:40.840 --> 56:45.320]  So they went ahead and planted a new row of trees so that you can't see in there.
[56:45.320 --> 56:49.960]  Also, Harrison, if you'll show this camera right here, they've got a stand-up
[56:49.960 --> 56:54.440]  portable security camera that they just have posted up across the street too. So
[56:54.440 --> 57:00.040]  just extra measures that they're taking to maintain their secrecy. And it's funny
[57:00.040 --> 57:05.000]  too, because you had Democrats who wanted to try to play the Logan Act against
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.280]  people in the Trump administration for having meetings or meeting with Russia
[57:08.280 --> 57:11.360]  or this or that and the other thing. Meanwhile, you've got multiple members of
[57:11.360 --> 57:15.600]  the Trump administration inside. You've got Tom Cotton, Lindsey Graham, other people
[57:15.600 --> 57:20.080]  that were invited to Bilderberg this year. I have heard radio silence on
[57:20.080 --> 57:24.160]  complaining about the Logan Act there as well. So it's amazing how Bilderberg
[57:24.160 --> 57:29.320]  just has this. They get to just operate differently. Oh, we will ignore the
[57:29.320 --> 57:33.520]  Logan Act when it comes to Bilderberg. Oh, we're Antifa. We're anti-fascist, but
[57:33.520 --> 57:38.080]  we'll ignore the Bilderberg group. Nothing to see there. No big deal. And I
[57:38.080 --> 57:41.080]  want to say this, Alex, and I don't know if this is possible. Maybe it's too late
[57:41.080 --> 57:46.080]  and perhaps even this is something that we should have thought of before. But you
[57:46.080 --> 57:48.920]  know how the news cycle is these days. It's absolutely crazy. It's impossible to
[57:48.920 --> 57:53.080]  have so much forethought. But you know what I think needs to happen? I think
[57:53.080 --> 57:58.160]  there needs to be a pro-Trump rally right here tomorrow. Right in front of the
[57:58.160 --> 58:01.720]  Bilderberg group. Because think about it. All right, we already got them. We got
[58:01.720 --> 58:06.480]  them. They're open. You know what? Two weeks ago, I was literally sitting there
[58:06.480 --> 58:08.720]  brushing my teeth. I don't know why you have those thoughts in the shower or
[58:08.720 --> 58:12.240]  brushing your teeth wherever kind of the morning. But I was thinking, I was
[58:12.240 --> 58:17.760]  thinking, we need to go have a anti-globalist protest this year. A big one
[58:17.760 --> 58:21.120]  in front of the enemies of Trump. Think about it, Alex. If we're out here saying
[58:21.120 --> 58:25.160]  Trump, Trump, Trump, that's what they hate. That's what the Bilderberg group is saying.
[58:25.160 --> 58:28.160]  I told you, listen, you lead it. Let's say, let's just say, everybody show up when
[58:28.160 --> 58:31.520]  you can. But you know, let's say, I'm wearing my Trump is my president shirt out
[58:31.520 --> 58:34.840]  here tomorrow with my make America free again hat. Meet me out here right in the
[58:34.840 --> 58:37.640]  global space. That's right. And it's Saturday. So let's say it goes, you know,
[58:37.640 --> 58:40.600]  noon to say seven o'clock at night. Everybody get there. We'll be right
[58:40.600 --> 58:45.880]  back. Wow. Wow. That the globalist cornered. Oh man.
[58:51.640 --> 58:55.760]  In America, more than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our
[58:55.760 --> 58:59.760]  research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about
[58:59.760 --> 59:03.040]  how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[59:03.040 --> 59:07.600]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of
[59:07.600 --> 59:11.400]  the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into the
[59:11.400 --> 59:15.800]  water. They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in. And when
[59:15.800 --> 59:19.880]  the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there
[59:19.880 --> 59:25.080]  telling you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now in 2016, even more
[59:25.080 --> 59:29.040]  information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and
[59:29.040 --> 59:33.840]  the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[59:33.840 --> 59:37.760]  ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is
[59:37.760 --> 59:41.520]  the real deal, folks. And the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view,
[59:41.520 --> 59:46.360]  to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at

[59:51.120 --> 59:57.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:18.680]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:24.720]  of the Info War. Ladies and gentlemen, we have got big breaking news.
[1:00:24.720 --> 1:00:27.920]  Bilderberg's agenda came out a few days ago. They used to give it a secret. They
[1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:31.480]  say dealing with Trump is number one. And members of Bilderberg group that are
[1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:35.760]  listed attendees are saying they want to bring down Trump so they're encamped
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:39.480]  outside DC. Global government's out in the open, but our corporate media is
[1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:44.440]  still so controlled. Zero US mainstream coverage, except for Drudge. He's not
[1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:47.760]  mainstream. He's leaked some of the European news articles and some of Paul
[1:00:47.760 --> 1:00:51.360]  Watson's articles about this. So Owen, continuing, I'm going to get David Knight
[1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:54.480]  to pop in later too as well. He's been filing some powerful reports on your
[1:00:54.480 --> 1:01:00.360]  observations. Well, I would say that just from covering it my first time,
[1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:04.640]  obviously it's a lot different now because it's out in public. I don't know
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:08.720]  if there's more media or less media here than there typically is. It seems like,
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:12.040]  you know, right now there's probably about 30 people out here. Most of them are,
[1:01:12.040 --> 1:01:15.280]  you know, anti-Bilderbergers. They're out here doing their own independent
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:18.760]  journalists broadcast. They're handing out newsletters, handing out flyers,
[1:01:18.760 --> 1:01:22.440]  talking to one another like-minded people. And these are the type of people I
[1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:26.560]  think would be willing to come out here in a Trump shirt, in a Trump hat, just
[1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:31.120]  to create the optics that, you know what? We won. So you might still be having
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:34.600]  your secret meeting in there and your number one agenda might be how to stop
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:39.000]  Donald Trump. But guess what? We won. We beat your rigged election. You're trying
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.080]  to hide the rigged election right now with certain things that you're doing in
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:45.640]  DC. We won't get into that at this time and certain prosecutors that wind up
[1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:49.680]  dead on a beach. But we won't get into that at this time. So I think that it
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:54.400]  would be such a win for us in the optics of this. And you know what, Alex? That
[1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:58.120]  might force the mainstream media to come out here. And how about this? What if we
[1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:02.400]  have a Trump rally out here in front of Bilderberg and then Antifa shows up?
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:07.440]  We're out here supporting President Trump, who is literally like a capitalist,
[1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:11.200]  like the example of a capitalist, somebody who goes out and builds, you know,
[1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:16.720]  real estate, golf courses, a capitalist. And Antifa comes out to protest a
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:20.720]  capitalist when they're anti-fascist. And the fascists are actually meeting
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:25.520]  right now. It's just ridiculous. And Alex, there was a report that David and I
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:29.800]  were going to file. And maybe we'll end up filing this later. And it really just
[1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:35.080]  is an example of the type of world that you will live in if these people get
[1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:40.600]  their way. Here in DC, we couldn't even park without using some ridiculous
[1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:45.240]  technology. You had to call a number, download an app, get your iris scanned,
[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:48.520]  some craziness. We don't even know if we ever paid for the spot. And then we go
[1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:52.720]  to a restaurant. They hand you a card. Your waitress doesn't take your order.
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:56.640]  You like walk around and scan your card. And then when you're finished, they
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:00.440]  take your card and then they rally up your charges. It's the most inconvenient
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:03.840]  thing in the world. That's the technocracy. That's what these people want.
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:07.200]  They don't want you out there working. They don't want me working. They want
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:11.240]  machines doing everything. So you can go hide out in your four by four apartment
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:14.520]  and everything will be okay. Everything will be tolerant. Everything will be just
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:18.600]  fine. The corptocracy is in control. And guess what? We're spying on everybody.
[1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:21.480]  We've got cameras everywhere. So we'll make sure that you're safe as long as
[1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:25.440]  you don't leave your apartment. That's the world that they want to create. And if
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:29.040]  people can actually recognize that that is what's going on here, if they can
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:33.760]  understand that this is nothing more than a global power grab to establish a
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:36.680]  world government. That's what they're talking about in their phones. That is
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:39.400]  why they're meeting. That is why they have to stop Donald Trump. That's why
[1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:42.560]  they're ticked off that he stopped the TPP. That's why they're ticked off. He
[1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:45.400]  wants to get out of NATO. That's why they're ticked off. He removed us from
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:49.280]  the climate Paris Agreement. And I forget who said this, but somebody said this when
[1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:53.120]  we were driving up here in the car today. If they really cared about the planet,
[1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:57.920]  then they would make a deal with Trump to get us back into the climate agreement.
[1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:00.680]  But that's not what it's about. It's not about the planet. If it was about the
[1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:05.480]  planet, Leonardo DiCaprio wouldn't have a 50 foot yacht that sails across the
[1:04:05.480 --> 1:04:10.200]  ocean spewing more global warming than, you know, a car that travels to work for
[1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:15.720]  a week. So it's completely a farce. It's nothing more than a power grab. And I
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:20.720]  just think it's amazing how these people get to have this meeting and not even
[1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:24.560]  get asked questions about it. Again, like I said, Lindsey Graham's on Fox News
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:29.240]  today. Zero questions. Not even one mention of Bilderberg. How is that
[1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:32.920]  possible when the number one agenda at the Bilderberg to address President
[1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:36.800]  Trump? And let's expand on that. They've been wanting to carbon tax since
[1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:40.360]  Kinley thought it up 30 years ago, 27 years ago with Al Gore. That's all on
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:44.200]  record. They have congressional hearings, but now when he'd be before Congress six
[1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:48.120]  seven years ago, he'd say there's no carbon tax. There's no they go. It's in the
[1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:52.520]  Paris treaty. He go. No, it's not. Oh, but I saw Al Gore's movie in 2008. It told me
[1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:56.280]  polar bears can't swim. Well, that's what I'm saying. It's just a total scam. It's
[1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:03.040]  unbelievable. We'll be back. Thank you, Ellen. Wow. Well, folks, it seems like life
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:07.800]  on the D list or decapitation list isn't what it's all cracked up to be. You've
[1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:12.560]  seen the now infamous images of comedian Kathy Griffin holding up the mock head
[1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:17.240]  of Donald Trump. And you see the endless news stories of her apologizing, her
[1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:21.040]  being called out by the left and right and losing some of her lucrative paying
[1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:24.240]  gigs. That's right. During this press conference, they're also going to announce
[1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:28.480]  her true motivation behind the photo shoot. Well, it doesn't really matter what
[1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:32.280]  your motivation was. Kathy, that's a mute point at this time. And now we see the
[1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:38.320]  true response of the liberals. I'm a victim. That's right. Kathy Griffin's
[1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:42.240]  going to hold a press conference to complain about bullying from the Trump
[1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:45.680]  family. She should be lucky. People are even talking about her. Please, for the
[1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:50.000]  sake of America, shut your piehole, crawl back into your she lob layer and just be
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:53.320]  happy that tweets are the only thing coming your way. Rob Dew reporting for

[1:06:08.280 --> 1:06:11.640]  best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:16.080]  That's why I'm introducing the shield toxic metal and chemical defense
[1:06:16.080 --> 1:06:20.800]  support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature
[1:06:20.800 --> 1:06:24.280]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the
[1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:29.360]  info war. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have
[1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:33.080]  been taking for over a year. And now we believe we have come as close to
[1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:37.040]  perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You want to
[1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:41.000]  yourself, you want to your family and you owe it to the future of this country
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:45.520]  in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:50.160]  you can be because we need you the remnant of America to reignite those
[1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:53.520]  rush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:06.280]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:51.960]  So we've got Trump coming out one of the most historic speeches ever by a
[1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:56.960]  president killing the main funding mechanism and the regulatory control
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:01.920]  system of the private corporate global government developed by Enron and Ken
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:08.040]  Lay and NM Rothschild. You can search engine. Ken Lay NM Rothschild got
[1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:12.440]  together in the late 80s when it was Senator Al Gore and they cooked up the
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:18.360]  global carbon tax, not a Tobin digital money tax, not a wellhead tax, but the
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:23.120]  first global tax is to be carbon. How do you push your carbon tax? A global
[1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:27.680]  government, a global regulatory system, save the earth also for global pandemics
[1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:31.840]  and now they're all saying we need global government for pandemics. We need
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:36.960]  global government for carbon to save the earth. We need all have our private
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:40.720]  jumbo jets and helicopters and arm guards and taxpayer paid for stuff,
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:44.120]  whether it's in Switzerland, like footage we're showing TV viewers right now or
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:50.360]  whether it's Chantilly, Virginia. Every four years, the last three times they
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:53.240]  met there previously in the 80s, they meet in Chantilly, Virginia. Our
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:57.800]  reporters are there. So contrast, Trump giving this globalist killing speech, I
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:01.960]  represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
[1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:08.160]  Just opposing that, with the media saying there's no global government now
[1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:12.720]  being forced to do it, now forced to admit global governments in crisis, while
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:16.760]  the very global government, Bilderberg is one of the main original meeting houses
[1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:20.600]  of that, government and private interest, meeting, trying to push world
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:24.040]  government and Bilderberg itself has leaked to the BBC that they created the
[1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:28.520]  EU, that they helped create so much more, that the old Nazi money of Europe at the
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:31.600]  end of World War II began to have these secret meetings with Western
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:36.440]  intelligence and then by 1954 in Usher-McHalland, they met at Bilderberg
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:43.000]  Hotel and gave it the official name of Club Bilderberg and so that's the
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:49.440]  reality. And how big a deal is this? How far have we come? Because we tend to not
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:53.680]  savor our successes. I'm the worst about it because I'm mission-oriented. It
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:56.840]  isn't about being famous or making money. Making money means we could be strong,
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:11:02.440]  expand and not be destroyed by global lawsuits and you know things like that.
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:07.080]  But that's not our goal. Our goal is to build a better world, to defeat these
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:11.560]  social engineers who think they're better than us, these bullies and the left and
[1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:15.760]  their control and no whites weak, you know, or weak-handed at colleges and just
[1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:20.000]  all the racism that the central government is spewing to reject their
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:25.640]  anti-family, anti-God program. It's a spiritual thing. We spiritually feel
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:29.160]  what they're doing. We see what they're doing. We coldly analyze what we're doing.
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:33.560]  We realize it's an existential threat to humanity. So Soros was in the news saying
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:37.640]  Trump is an existential threat to the EU. He means what Trump represents. Hillary
[1:11:37.640 --> 1:11:43.400]  the same day said info wars lost me the election. Darkheart Jones is the enemy.
[1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:49.600]  She's shooting up her back being folks when she does that and I understand that
[1:11:49.600 --> 1:11:54.000]  and there's a lot of evil, you know, attacks on info wars, a lot of bad
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:58.160]  energy they're throwing our way. That's why your prayers are more important than
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:03.640]  ever because I can handle it. Some people around me quite frankly can't. But this
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:07.280]  is a spiritual war and that's why we need your prayers more than ever. Day to
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:10.240]  night from Chantilly, Virginia right outside where they've set up makeshift
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:17.400]  fences around the five-star Marriott conference center nearby the golf course
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:21.320]  there. They've got that all blocked up. I want to get your analysis of
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:24.440]  witnessing this. You've covered Bilderberg obviously in Europe as well.
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:27.760]  You've covered Bilderberg many times for info wars. David Knight reporting for
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:33.320]  info wars.com. David, I hear Bilderberg 2017 and Alex as you can see here this
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:37.080]  is the only thing that is visible. A few of these orange barricades for people
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:40.720]  who are driving by. It looks like maybe there's some construction going on here
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:43.440]  and of course nothing can be seen because the heavy forest station around
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:47.440]  the perimeter. The police will even hang back and stand behind the walls. It's a
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:53.280]  very subtle behind-the-scenes presence. Here in the suburbs people don't even
[1:12:53.280 --> 1:12:56.920]  know that these world leaders are meeting and that's the essence of this Alex.
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:13:01.800]  It's the secrecy and as they're yeah normally when they have a G8 this is
[1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:06.720]  more important than G8 or G20. It's huge news. This is a secret G20 basically.
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:11.220]  That's right because these are really the people who make the decisions. You know
[1:13:11.220 --> 1:13:15.440]  we had the headlines earlier today. You saw the clip on the drudge report. Earth
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:20.720]  says to Trump FU well they don't speak for the earth and quite frankly these
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:23.760]  people even the governments the world government or the individual
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:27.000]  governments they're not really in charge either. It's a transnational the
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:30.840]  multinational corporations and they're here telling these various government
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:35.800]  officials what's going to happen and as they have quietly taken over this hotel
[1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:40.800]  and this area they are quietly trying to take over the world. The good news is
[1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:45.220]  that we see people like Joe Scarborough on Morning Joe going totally apoplectic.
[1:13:45.220 --> 1:13:49.200]  We saw the same thing a couple of days ago about Angela Merkel. So that's when
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:53.200]  you know you're there you were winning is when they get that upset. And one of
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:56.800]  the things that came out Alex as they were talking about this some disgruntled
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:00.200]  loser within the Trump administration is talking to the press anonymously and
[1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:04.040]  says there was never any debate about this. Donald Trump has opposed this from
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:08.600]  the beginning he never had anything good to say for the climate treaty. Good I'm
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:13.120]  happy he did that. He campaigned against it. He was very frank about the the
[1:14:13.120 --> 1:14:16.440]  problems with this and understand we've talked a lot about the science and we
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:20.040]  can have that scientific debate. But let's understand as you pointed out
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:25.760]  earlier this is not about saving the earth. This is about transferring money
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:30.080]  and it's about setting up a crony corporate taxes about establishing the
[1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:33.840]  funding for a world government. That's what this is truly about. If they wanted
[1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:37.920]  to save the world they wouldn't give China the ability the number one polluter
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:42.600]  according to them the ability to continue to increase their missions until 2030
[1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:48.240]  and only then begin to do some token cuts when they do massive cuts to the US to
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:52.680]  Western Europe. India signed on to this thing and they didn't even commit to any
[1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:57.640]  cuts and they didn't they committed to looking at their carbon density at some
[1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:00.680]  point in the future but not to any cuts. And the key thing that we have to
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:05.080]  understand here as they're pushing back against this is that the the signing
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:09.000]  that Obama did at the time he said I'm going to ratify this myself I'm not
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:14.160]  going to go to the Senate. So he has no effect here. Clearly when Donald Trump is
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:17.320]  talking about this he said I'm not going to enforce any of these agreed
[1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:21.120]  limitations on our economy on our interviews. You have to understand that
[1:15:21.120 --> 1:15:25.880]  they are trying to make you pay for your energy the same way that the foreign
[1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:29.240]  that the foreign the federal reserve which actually has a foreigner setting on
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:36.520]  as the New York Fed chair but you have to understand that these people who have
[1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:41.440]  been renting us our money all of this time now want to rent us our energy
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:44.720]  that's what these carbon taxes are about. They're an indulgence that you have to
[1:15:44.720 --> 1:15:47.240]  pay to the world government that's why the Pope is signing on to this he
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:51.480]  understands indulgences you have to pay them for the sin of using energy you
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:54.080]  want to heat your home you want to cool your home you want to travel somewhere
[1:15:54.080 --> 1:15:58.360]  you will pay these people like Elon Musk who is so upset about this his
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:03.040]  business model is carbon taxes his business model is carbon credits he
[1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:06.680]  doesn't make any money selling these cars that he sells to people who have a
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:11.400]  net worth of $250,000 he gets his subsidies for the cars when he
[1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:15.640]  manufactures them he gets subsidized plants he gets subsidization on the sale
[1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:19.200]  of the car and the people who buy it get subsidized and he still loses money
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:26.120]  last year up to May of 2016 he had lost $400 million even though he's getting
[1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:30.040]  these massive subsidies that's why these people are so upset but Alex there's
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:33.920]  not only opposition from outside the Trump administration there's opposition
[1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:37.640]  of course inside the Trump administration. Wilbur Ross is here he is a
[1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:42.640]  former senior managing director at Rothschild Bank and the day before this
[1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:47.440]  began he told foreign policy magazine reported that he said hey we're going to
[1:16:47.440 --> 1:16:52.680]  take another look at TTIP and the headline that they had was Wilbur Ross
[1:16:52.680 --> 1:17:00.280]  Breeze New Life entity TTIP and what he said was that we have to go through the
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:05.520]  European Union for any economic negotiations any trade negotiations
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:12.560]  again establishing this supranational authority vis-a-vis Europe saying we're
[1:17:12.560 --> 1:17:15.480]  not going to be negotiating with individual companies he said legally
[1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:18.680]  that's what we have to do so basically he's dumping on the sovereignty of the
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:22.880]  individual European states and then upholding the European Union at the same
[1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:27.000]  time saying that they're going to go back to TTIP we have to understand the
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:30.980]  three legs of control that the globalists are doing are the open
[1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:35.480]  borders these economic trade agreements which they then spin into political
[1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:40.120]  control and that's the TTP and the TTIP and of course Donald Trump killed the
[1:17:40.120 --> 1:17:44.520]  TTP on day one that's a trans-pacific partnership nothing was said about the
[1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:49.320]  TTIP until Wilbur Ross brought it up before he came here to Bilderberg so
[1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:54.240]  there's competition within Donald Trump's cabinet people who are still
[1:17:54.240 --> 1:17:57.200]  trying to push against that that's what we're concerned about as we look at this
[1:17:57.200 --> 1:18:01.080]  but so far Donald Trump has done the right thing he's opposed them on these
[1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:04.800]  trade agreements he's opposed them on the climate agreements and he's back now
[1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:08.400]  saying we're gonna continue to fight them on the board he's delivering and let's
[1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:11.040]  stop right there I always said this in the media made a big joke out of it
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:15.200]  that turned into a meme viewed more than 30 million times online that you know use
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:20.160]  Mordor I don't care if Trump has goblin guides going into the Mayans of Moria
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:25.520]  or going into one of these you know subterranean pits of the swamp before
[1:18:25.520 --> 1:18:28.720]  he called it a swamp I was calling it Mordor and you know the goblin pits I
[1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:31.560]  think the swamp is probably a better analogy more folks over to swamp is
[1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:35.840]  versus the world of J.R.R. Tolkien but I said I don't care if he goes into a
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:39.560]  goblin pit with a goblin guide and goblets vomit on him and he cuts them up
[1:18:39.560 --> 1:18:43.640]  he's got goblin blood on him I don't want to catch him kissing goblins and
[1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:47.360]  then of course you know I don't want to catch him in bed with a goblin and so
[1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:50.240]  they made a big joke that I'm concerned he's having sex with goblins Jones is
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:53.920]  totally insane thinking their readers don't know what an analogy is or an
[1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:59.640]  allegory or a parallel or a parable but so far he's been using the goblins about
[1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:04.520]  90% of the time he's winning he's actually co-opted the goblins masterfully
[1:19:04.520 --> 1:19:09.160]  they all want to slit his throat but they all respect him and so so far he's
[1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:13.720]  keeping them on a short shock collar Donald Trump has the new order on a
[1:19:13.720 --> 1:19:17.920]  shock collar right now yes I'm on a shot goblins the goblins are very upset
[1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:22.000]  and you're talking about collars and people on leashes it was interesting to
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:28.920]  see Macron who was the big hope of the EU and again promoting consolidation in
[1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:34.200]  Europe even beyond what Merkel wants he came out yesterday and said that he wants
[1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:39.400]  to have a mutualization of the debt of the the people we call the pigs

[1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:13.000]  sitting here they're in the break thinking about times in history where
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:17.440]  more has been happening and I can't think of it and the fact that private
[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:21.080]  corporate interest for basically a hundred years have tried to build this
[1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:26.800]  private corporate world government on the British Empire model and stealth
[1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:31.920]  implementation and the fact that they tried to stonewall from the days of
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:39.440]  Barry Goldwater 45 50 years ago and that they failed and that Ron Paul and
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:43.440]  Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan and Pat Buchanan and Matt Drudge and Alex
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:49.200]  Jones and David Knight and everybody else that opposed this private arrogant
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:55.800]  fake liberal shaver of the earth global government Hollywood PR BS machine that
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:59.040]  it's identified as unelected it's identified as authoritarian it's
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:04.280]  identified as above-the-law tax exempt diplomatically immune the new royalty
[1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:08.280]  it's identified as anti-human it's identified as anti-prosperity it's
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:15.800]  identified as using 1860s eugenics as its operating system I mean Hitler was
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:21.440]  literally a spinoff of this thing Kaiserville home Institute Cold Springs
[1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:26.760]  Harbor New York look up these terms that I'm giving you the bedrock and not like
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:33.320]  I'm some grand poob off the history is a fact that IBM was set up to learn how to
[1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:38.640]  exterminate everybody who wasn't white you look at IBM today it funds the Black
[1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:42.360]  Lives Matter the cop killer groups the open borders groups because they want to
[1:25:42.360 --> 1:25:46.720]  solve each other's throats they've gone from just hating the minorities who are
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:51.360]  the majority to hating everybody and I don't want to be part of it I if you're
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:54.520]  white I don't want to sterilize with Gardasil if you're Hispanic I don't want
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:57.760]  you sterilize does that mean I want to be beat on the head with a Mexican flag
[1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:02.440]  and called a gringo no but I don't hate you as a human I want you to be my
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:07.360]  friend and the psychopaths call me a schmuck they go the general public's a
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:10.640]  bunch of animals whether they be a poor white person or a poor black person or a
[1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:16.000]  poor Hispanic person stop trying Alex I have the knowledge the globalist have
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:20.680]  I'm simply trying to give it to you and most the audience knows more than I do
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:23.160]  that's what's scary if you're just reality-based
[1:26:23.160 --> 1:26:27.560]  Bilderberg's real the INF the World Bank's real the TPP's real it's all
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:35.160]  unelected world government's real Bilderberg's real Trump is devastating
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:38.280]  it for real and and you know you got some of the Trump's people going to
[1:26:38.280 --> 1:26:43.040]  Bilderberg I think that violates the Logan Act but Trump's all about going to
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:46.240]  meetings he says we'll meet with Kim Jong-un anybody so I get some of his
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:49.200]  people who have good policies but they're going to the meetings try to
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:53.880]  influence things he's all about coming to the table but the point is maybe
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:56.920]  they'll come out and tell us what happened at these events but some listeners
[1:26:56.920 --> 1:27:02.080]  are like hey couple of his people the word is McMaster's going well McMaster
[1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:05.120]  goes to these meetings I don't really like McMaster but what I really care
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:09.600]  about is what Trump actually does what his minions do is secondary those are
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:14.640]  those are his swamp creature guides those are that's golem McMaster and people
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:19.080]  like golem again helping you know the hobbits into Mordor to throw the ring
[1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:24.320]  into the crack of doom keep using that allegory go ahead David not with our
[1:27:24.320 --> 1:27:30.080]  points yeah you're right Alex we got Wilbur golem Ross just saying that we
[1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:34.160]  hey we never got out of TTIP so we have to understand there's he's facing
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:37.840]  opposition within and without but as we just saw with the Paris Climate Treaty
[1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:42.200]  the people who lost in that fight inside the administration said he was never
[1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:45.880]  really paying any attention to us he was pushing it back against that from day
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:50.880]  one so that's good news now the key here Alex is I think as we look at the way
[1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:54.240]  that they have opposed him well that's it he's bringing globalist in to keep an
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:59.240]  eye on them yeah the way that they have opposed him in terms of saying hey we've
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:03.480]  got all of these secret meetings all of these back channels you know whenever
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:06.200]  the Democrats do it it's not a back channel okay it's it they're just
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:09.600]  trying to open things up but when somebody else does it they do dossiers they
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:12.840]  do back channels and so forth look if you want to investigate something they
[1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:15.800]  come out and they make all these innuendos and never make any clear
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:20.520]  allegations if you want to investigate some secret meetings between powerful
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:26.400]  people that violate ethics violate the law investigate Bilderberg this is the
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:30.160]  elephant oh my gosh you've got I know you followed reports on this but this is
[1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:33.640]  the angle I totally missed it you're right they're claiming all this secret
[1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:36.160]  Russian collusion when there is none because Trump might have been at the
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:39.840]  same hotel in the public of eating you know some Russian ambassador was that
[1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:43.600]  happens in DC that's not the issue you've got the big corporate global
[1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:47.880]  government leaders from China you name it meeting in secret with our politicians
[1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:51.720]  this is the secret meeting and exactly and this is the very great pointing the
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:54.800]  fingers at Trump like he's done something wrong Trump should call out
[1:28:54.800 --> 1:28:59.040]  Bilderberg at the same time Bilderberg is starting which they totally ignore
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:03.120]  they're trying to fared out a new meeting that they think might have happened
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:07.320]  between a US senator sessions and a Russian ambassador it's like but what
[1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:10.120]  about this what about this why aren't you looking at this why aren't you
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:14.040]  covering this this is the true issue and for the listeners for the people who
[1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:18.920]  are waking up Alex this is the Rosetta Stone this is when they realize that the
[1:29:18.920 --> 1:29:23.720]  mainstream media and the establishment politicians have a phony agenda a hidden
[1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:28.720]  agenda just like Bilderberg this is the physical manifestation of that agenda
[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:32.520]  you're absolutely right thank you David I will keep watching your filed reports

[1:33:26.120 --> 1:33:47.720]  I'm coming down fast but now for you ladies and gentlemen we launched a
[1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:52.240]  contest a couple days ago info wars dot com for slash contest with $200,000 in
[1:33:52.240 --> 1:33:55.960]  prizes and I told you that it's up to my discretion but I love to pay out on
[1:33:55.960 --> 1:34:00.120]  these so you know if you go wearing an info wars dot com shirt and scream
[1:34:00.120 --> 1:34:03.120]  Bill Clinton's a rapist I think I'm gonna go ahead and still pay a thousand
[1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:07.320]  dollars if you wear one of these shirts we're selling as Kathy Griffin on it
[1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:12.640]  and says CNN terrorist or CNN fake news make your own shirt make your own poster
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:17.760]  I don't care a thousand dollars you get info wars dot com repeatedly verbally
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:21.760]  out over the air on national television $2,500 it isn't even about the
[1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:26.720]  publicity we get I want them to know it's me coming after them they've already
[1:34:26.720 --> 1:34:29.840]  tried to destroy my life destroy my family Hillary came out call me the
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:33.600]  dark arch came out two days ago and from a big group of Democrats and said
[1:34:33.600 --> 1:34:39.920]  info wars lost her the election and that I am commanding the Russians oh yeah
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:43.640]  it's a five-minute clip she said oh the Russians don't understand America like
[1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:47.200]  this info wars that's coordinating and then they coordinate with them and they
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:52.000]  drop the info no when they would drop the WikiLeaks we would go search engine
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:59.360]  it and use control F for keywords and so we could search thousands of pages a
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:04.280]  second Dumbo and so the Russians weren't here going to go look at page
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:11.200]  791 we would search things like kids or we would search things like lies or
[1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:16.720]  polls or debate and then we'd find you ringing the debates but and reading the
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:20.640]  polls but see that's how you change the subject we're going to James O'Keefe
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:24.520]  who's being sued I can't talk about it because there was a confidential
[1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:29.200]  settlement but let's just say I was very pleased with the settlement with
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:33.160]  Chobhanna yogurt the owner of it a member of the Federal Reserve Board of
[1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:38.680]  New York and let's just say that when people got on the news or fake news like
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:42.560]  what's that guy's name Stephen Colbert and said that cash on the bottom I oh
[1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:46.760]  that's BS on the bottom buddy but I'm not gonna get into which direction the
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:52.920]  cash was going but it'd be news if you knew wouldn't it once they figured out
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:36:00.240]  what I was gonna do we'll stop right there but let's let's just walk this
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:04.880]  back to our guest James O'Keefe's only got about 10 minutes for this project
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:11.400]  veritas.com he's being sued for the videos of Democratic operatives talking
[1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:15.280]  about how they were going to go out and manipulate the election and get people
[1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:19.320]  to vote who'd already voted before and how no one could stop them and so now
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:23.640]  he's being sued for a million dollars and by the way they have to say a
[1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:27.360]  millions it could be unlimited okay it was only really being sued for 10,000
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:30.920]  it's the statute of the state you're suited in Idaho it's 10,000 and then go
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:34.200]  to the moon well where O'Keefe's being sued it could be even higher than that
[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:39.600]  they have to get a certain number and so democracy partners attacks veritas
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:45.120]  launches one million dollar federal lawsuit and so that's where all of this
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:49.000]  is going and he joins us remember the clips talk about game changer in the
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:54.440]  election it's not true that I are you defeated Hillary veritas drudge O'Keefe
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:36:58.000]  all of us together our resistance together defeated her and their own
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:03.840]  actions defeated her she's blamed 20 different groups veritas drudge info
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:10.200]  wars the Russians misogyny racism never the fact that people are sick of her in
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:15.600]  her policies so James O'Keefe thanks for joining us thank you have me on Alex I
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:19.920]  think reality defeated Hillary Clinton you know the truth defeated Hillary
[1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:24.800]  Clinton and now just yesterday it was announced the law through the million
[1:37:24.800 --> 1:37:29.400]  dollar lawsuit against my team veritas from this guy Bob Kramer who's one of
[1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:33.880]  Barack Obama's close friends we're basically retaliating you know we we exposed
[1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:38.280]  the fraud during the election we exposed that the four-part series sending
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:43.640]  shockwaves to the DNC about voter fraud use of dark money from an overseas
[1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:48.000]  donor to arrange these types of things so they they sued them me for a million
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:51.560]  dollars and they want to shut us down then I get calls from politico I get
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:54.960]  calls from these mainstream outlets that suddenly want to talk to me now that I'm
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:38:00.080]  being sued and I want to be funny this lawsuit I've said that over my dead body
[1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:05.600]  will ever shut up and I'm going to I'm actually hiring over a dozen undercover
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:10.000]  journalists to start next week and respond to this but Bob Kramer Barack
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:13.920]  Obama's friend and the person Hillary Clinton had the fire is now suing me for
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:17.360]  a million dollars for the videos that we did during the election now you're
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:20.280]  meeting with him at his offices you're meeting with him in restaurants you're
[1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:24.200]  an undercover journalist you're clearly covered by this they persecuted the pro
[1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:27.680]  livers that went behind the scenes in private medical facilities but if you're
[1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:33.480]  exposing a crime obviously then you are according to law no longer under you
[1:38:33.480 --> 1:38:36.520]  know medical rules or or you know things like that because you're exposing
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:40.760]  corruption but clearly you're in public places at restaurants and in hotel
[1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:45.240]  lobbies with this guy and we could play the clips again where he is just saying
[1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:48.640]  outrageous stuff about the election and how he's gonna do this and how he's gonna
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:52.560]  do that you talk to his minions this is like award-winning stuff you did I mean
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:55.400]  this is like this is beyond stuff in movies what you pulled off with your
[1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:59.160]  teams so to me this is about just silencing you but more importantly
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:04.240]  intimidating other people that oh look we'll sue you if you do more stuff like
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:08.600]  James O'Keeffe did yeah I mean I think I think investigative journalism itself
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:13.400]  is is on the line I mean a lot of media companies don't have the don't have the
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:18.720]  brass balls it takes to go out and speak truth to power I said on your show
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:22.520]  before that a lot of these a lot of these companies journalists a lot of these
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:26.640]  media organizations can't do the job because they're worried about the
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:30.840]  government regulators coming after them let's say if Hillary was elected and I
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:35.040]  and I and we went out on a limb and did it be and and they're trying to deter us
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:40.040]  and establishment news organizations from speaking truth to power against the
[1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:43.200]  establishment because this is what happens to you when you do so you get
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:47.400]  sued for a million dollars it was a fresh stunt creamer is pulling million
[1:39:47.400 --> 1:39:50.120]  dollars what does that even mean a million dollars and we're on the right
[1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:53.800]  I'm not worried about it I mean the legal issues are kind of complex but he's
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:58.520]  trying to say that I've reached fiduciary duty by having my journalist
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:03.920]  film him well the journalist duty is to Veritas not to Bob Kramer and the stuff
[1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:07.760]  this people were staying in the Cape is just I mean I'm happy to revisit it
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:13.840]  it's talking about Hillary's idea to put ducks on the ground code word for get
[1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:17.800]  punched in the face and incite by the Trump rally he was saying that he knows
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:21.640]  other people who can illegally register voters and across state lines using fake
[1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:28.360]  IDs and shell companies and by the way Alex we live in a media environment
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:32.000]  where people can use anonymous sources every single claim that we make is
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:36.840]  buttressed by videotape of them saying what they said exactly yet you're not
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:39.680]  supposed to believe us you're supposed to believe all these journalists to use
[1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:43.240]  anonymous sources quoting hearsay from other anonymous sources so I believe
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:47.520]  that this lawsuit is an attempt to silence me and I the state might put out
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:52.440]  yesterday was that over my dead body would I ever be silenced the next main
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:57.200]  target of Veritas is the media we will be releasing some big stories against
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:01.120]  these media companies and and frankly I'm not too worried about the lawsuit but
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:06.040]  but I think it's going to be a fight exactly and you know my next target is
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:09.640]  the media that's why we're doing a contest you know basically pointing out
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:13.680]  that CNN promotes terrorists memes but so does other mainstream media saying
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:17.440]  kill Trump murder Trump and so we're gonna expand it just to say you know
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:21.400]  you'll basically wear t-shirts or have signs saying CNN is fake media MSNBC is
[1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:24.280]  fake media doesn't matter as long as it's mainstream media people are exposing
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:28.960]  they can be part of that contest but expanding on this I'm not gonna get into
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:31.440]  the settlement with Shabani because I did an agreement with them and I'm not
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:35.800]  going to get into other things that have happened but when we cover somebody else's
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:40.800]  report that is in a hundred percent accurate I come out before they even
[1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:47.560]  criticize us and say we were wrong about this then that's taken as weakness we
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:53.480]  get sued they use our correction as the excuse that we admit we were slightly
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:58.960]  wrong about something then I realized these people are doing these lawsuits
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:04.680]  for publicity stunts to simply put info wars calm or veritas project on the
[1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:08.520]  news as if we're these horrible demons that are being shut down are being
[1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:12.440]  destroyed so this is their tactic so then I realize I guess in the future I
[1:42:12.440 --> 1:42:19.120]  can't settle suits even if I then later realize that I'm not paying anything out
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:24.040]  in fact it's the other way around you're like oh my god they didn't they didn't
[1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:28.240]  care about that they just wanted me to say I was wrong go ahead sorry no they
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:31.560]  but the same thing happened with us in the acorn story that we did you know
[1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:35.400]  eight years ago we got sued by acorn and I and it would have cost me a million
[1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:40.080]  dollars to fight this lawsuit it was not over whether or not the tapes were
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:45.280]  true everything we report was true it was over whether I had his permission to
[1:42:45.280 --> 1:42:50.680]  film him but the fact that they sued me and I settled the lawsuit and then now
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:54.840]  Wikipedia entry says oh you know keep us guilty he said who lost it well I said
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:42:58.120]  lawsuit because I can't I don't have the funds to spend a million dollars on
[1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:02.520]  on fighting this is this permission to record government workers I think all
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:05.520]  government work should be recorded during their duties I don't think we
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:09.320]  should have that permission at their taxpayer funded and it's a public place
[1:43:09.320 --> 1:43:12.920]  but this is the tactic they use and it's and it's so important I told my team
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:16.760]  yesterday Alex I said for every defensive thing that we say and do one
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:21.800]  statement or or activity on offense we can't let these people manipulate the
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:26.440]  narrative and I know it's going to be a fight and I believe I bet you that
[1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:29.360]  that they're going to invoke the right to the hurt in the fifth amendment right
[1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:33.400]  to self-incrimination if they do get deposed I would love it Bob Cramer and
[1:43:33.400 --> 1:43:37.160]  Scott Bovell got deposed because the stuff they're saying and he says the
[1:43:37.160 --> 1:43:40.160]  Attorney General Wisconsin right now is a criminal investigation into Scott
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:45.920]  Bovell that's ongoing so he might get arrested but we got it we got it double
[1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:49.080]  down we got to fight back and that destiny of journalism is on the line
[1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:53.240]  what it is David Live my colleague his friend they they they they stormed into
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:57.360]  his house in California with AR 15 that the Kalmala Harris the state government
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:00.840]  California it confiscated his hard drives because they didn't like he was
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:04.840]  investigating plant parenthood I mean we were living in unbelievable times and
[1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:10.360]  every one of us has to fight back not be silent not be shut down by these by
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:16.600]  these frivolous lawsuits and that's my intention I think you're right expand on
[1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:21.080]  some of the things that Bob Cramer has said on video well Bob Cramer was the
[1:44:21.080 --> 1:44:24.000]  main the main thing he said which was most devastating and the reason why
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:30.280]  Hillary fired him is because he said that it was Hillary Hillary's idea to
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:36.080]  put ducks on the ground but it was in fact her idea to put these people at
[1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:41.160]  Trump events in Chicago and elsewhere get punched in the face in bulk
[1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:46.280]  violence was all her idea and then he sets us up with this with this guy
[1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:51.680]  Scott Fogel who tells us how to bust people across state lines and Scott
[1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:55.440]  Fogel says that it was the Hillary Clinton campaign paying this other group
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:45:00.160]  paying this other group which paid democracy partners and got people on the
[1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:03.760]  ground who's talking about an illegal transfer of money Scott Fogel was
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:09.720]  fired Bob Cramer was let go Bob Cramer is a particularly soulless immoral
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:14.200]  character he's married to Congresswoman Jan Czackowski out of Illinois and it
[1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:16.800]  was devastating and I think he's gonna spend the rest of his natural life
[1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:21.400]  trying to bring me down or make my life a living hell he's very close to
[1:45:21.400 --> 1:45:25.400]  Barack Obama he visited the White House some 47 times and Alex in this lawsuit
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:30.640]  he falsely accuses me of entering the White House using false pretenses in
[1:45:30.640 --> 1:45:35.040]  fact Bob Cramer did invite my undercover reporter to the White House but we
[1:45:35.040 --> 1:45:39.360]  couldn't go imagine that he invited my undercover reporter to meet with the
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:43.400]  president and I couldn't go because they don't want to break the law I can't go
[1:45:43.400 --> 1:45:46.680]  into the White House using a fake idea remember you said at the time you said
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:52.480]  at the time yeah but the point is is this guy was close with Barack Obama he
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:56.240]  is in fact he was sitting in the front row of a speech that Barack Obama gave
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:00.480]  shortly after the election and he invited us to go meet with him and he's
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:06.200]  talking about all this illegal stuff that they're doing I and the media
[1:46:06.200 --> 1:46:11.360]  doesn't care the media doesn't doesn't just doesn't trust us why I bet or so my
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:14.440]  claims of videotape they make up stuff with environment sources I think we
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:18.400]  need to start saying to the media unless you actually show us tape or your
[1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:22.480]  notebooks of what these sources are saying we don't believe you because you
[1:46:22.480 --> 1:46:26.120]  have no credibility every prediction everything you said during the election
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:30.400]  was proved to be wrong but this is the game we play Andrew Breiber always told
[1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:33.960]  me we have to be held to a higher standard but in any event that's what
[1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:39.560]  Cramer did that's what we're facing and we're gonna fight it did he try to settle
[1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:48.040]  something before he sued you well he's been going after me Alex I give a
[1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:51.760]  speech in New York and he said one of his minions there the guy threw himself
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:56.240]  down the stairs they was Ryan Clayton he called the NYPD and he said James will
[1:46:56.240 --> 1:46:58.960]  keep assault to be James will keep assault of me so they do this thing
[1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:02.640]  called bird dogging where they do this adjutant prop stuff now the difference
[1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:07.400]  to what I do when he does is he makes stuff up you just manufacturers crap he
[1:47:07.400 --> 1:47:10.840]  puts Russian flags in people's hands his feedback if they look everyone likes
[1:47:10.840 --> 1:47:17.280]  Russia it's a kind of immoral depravity with no ethics and no integrity where
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:21.160]  they just where they just literally incite violent events so he's been
[1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:26.000]  coming after me that way I'm not afraid of it please don't mistake this as me
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:30.520]  complaining I welcome the challenge I think it's a sign of the battles join
[1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:34.520]  and folks need to know that you are on the battlefield and you are in toe-to-toe
[1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:39.280]  combat with the slime balls yes and I think people need to realize that people
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:44.120]  are afraid I was I mean people this is a deterrent people will not air this
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:48.480]  these stories because they are afraid these stories were spiked by the
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:53.320]  mainstream media including Fox News they did not want to air them because they
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:57.240]  did not want to deal with the liability not good the good news is info wars and
[1:47:57.240 --> 1:48:02.240]  drugs did yeah that you guys did you guys absolutely did you always do it I
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:06.040]  thank you very much for putting your neck on the line brother we're in this
[1:48:06.040 --> 1:48:09.000]  together if there were more people like you James O'Keefe we'd be out of the
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:12.760]  woods very quickly the more true it gets the worse it gets that's what you need
[1:48:12.760 --> 1:48:16.280]  to remember the more true it gets the more lethal the more effective the more
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:21.040]  you expose the less likely that these established groups are going to air the
[1:48:21.040 --> 1:48:24.680]  stories that's why you guys got to stand up guys got to tweet the stories out and
[1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:29.040]  I promise you we are going to have some major ones coming and I can't wait to be
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:32.200]  on your show all right James O'Keefe great job God bless you we appreciate you
[1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:36.920]  my friend thank you thank you you know it's a scary thing a lot of folks in
[1:48:36.920 --> 1:48:40.800]  media even the new media think they're in competition with people now we need
[1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:46.520]  more James O'Keefe's more Matt drudges more Donald Trump's more Donald Trump
[1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:55.320]  juniors because they come after you but as there becomes more and more of a
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:48:59.320]  standing up it becomes harder and harder for the global to control people and so
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:04.040]  that's why I'm here and why I'm fighting so hard but they're coming after us
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:12.400]  because we're destroying them right now this is a 21st century war and of
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:18.360]  course this lawsuit has no merit of course O'Keefe's gonna win but they
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:22.360]  want to drag him through the mud with big Democrat money trying to destroy him
[1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:26.280]  on the way and then what okay they lose the suit okay maybe he gets attorney's
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:31.920]  fees three years from now but they've pulled O'Keefe who caused them billions
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:37.280]  of dollars of financial global damage by that it cost their propaganda
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:40.520]  billions of dollars to put Hillary in he just caused billions of dollars of
[1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:45.800]  truth to come in and it's not his fault Hillary did the thing she did the people
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:50.920]  he videotaped said the things they said they're not suing him for taking out a
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:54.960]  context or editing it they're suing him saying these people claim they were
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:58.480]  coming to work for us they didn't get the job did they and it was in public
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:02.400]  places so trying to sue saying oh well you know you really work for us when you
[1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:06.720]  did that so you know you're on our time now so that's our proprietary knowledge
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:11.840]  that we're gonna get people to vote over and over again illegally or that we're

[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:29.200]  say about that here's what's happening the globalist thought they could bring
[1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:33.120]  in a whole world government and just always have the media say it doesn't
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:36.520]  exist and that somehow they found a global government with global taxes a
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:41.240]  global army global courts that's all unelected and absolutely authoritarian
[1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:48.960]  and somehow that would fly that's what they think and then you've got
[1:54:48.960 --> 1:54:53.680]  Kathy Griffin and all these people running around in the news pushing violence
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:57.160]  and then Griffin comes out their lawyer and says I'm not sorry Trump's talked
[1:54:57.160 --> 1:55:00.840]  bad about women before so I'm gonna double down on what I'm doing first she
[1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:06.120]  says she's sorry and then she says she isn't I said she's not even the bad one

[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:41.880]  you said you've been bullied by the Trump family have they reached out to you
[1:56:41.880 --> 1:56:45.440]  outside of social media I don't think they have to my impression is that they
[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:50.040]  have mobilized their armies or their box or whatever they do I like I said it's
[1:56:50.040 --> 1:56:55.040]  quite clear to me that they're trying to use me as a distraction and I'm not
[1:56:55.040 --> 1:56:59.240]  going to be damaged for this stuff I think he's a fool so I'm gonna say I
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:03.600]  think the president is going on this way you know I can say that fear for
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:07.720]  your career after this storm does down absolutely I don't think I will have a
[1:57:07.720 --> 1:57:12.360]  career after this I think he didn't have a career I think it was a stunt I'm
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:16.720]  gonna be honest he broke me he broke me
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:24.240]  and then I was like no this is a fight I just wanted him dead I apologize I get
[1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:29.200]  a publicity stunt and I'm a bad actress I saw the tide turning and I saw what
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:32.200]  they were doing I went oh okay they're trying to spin this so they're making
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:35.440]  about Darren and obviously that was never my intent it would never want to
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:39.320]  hurt but she's so fake she's a bad actress I started listening to my grandmother
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:41.840]  that earlier photo when she looked better she did it'll be the same red hair
[1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:45.280]  and same white skin same bone structure personally across the country of my
[1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:49.800]  grandmother was not like this lady though so yeah I don't know what's I don't

[2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:03.800]  pretty stable in europe in the united states we've got our problems but now

[2:02:15.880 --> 2:02:21.760]  clubs and i'm they got good food and good comedy i'm going there but i mean the
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:27.200]  claim that there aren't black owned or hispanic owned a lot of asian owned
[2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:29.800]  restaurants i know too but i mean the point is it's just you go to these
[2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:34.520]  comedy clubs a lot of the time a white dude doesn't own it or four or five
[2:02:34.520 --> 2:02:39.560]  people on it i mean this is just crazy and so white dudes bad that he goes and

[2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:09.600]  how many women are involved in record companies vise levels how many women are
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:15.760]  producers in big movies you know how many women here's my experience with
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:19.640]  women on average and this is with the statistic show they end up wanting to
[2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:25.040]  have a baby or they end up wanting after they make $50 million they want to go
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:31.200]  they want to stop and for whatever reason men tend to not stop and believe
[2:03:31.200 --> 2:03:36.680]  me men stop plenty to all the time people get out of the kitchen man it's too
[2:03:36.680 --> 2:03:41.400]  hot they can't handle it or you you know you don't want to get you we start
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:44.200]  having a heart problem or you know you know you get cancer that'll get you out
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:50.320]  of the kitchen but men kill themselves to build things for their women and their
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:53.640]  children doesn't mean women can't build things or children can't men though go
[2:03:53.640 --> 2:03:56.840]  out and fight wars and dies and they you know your men you're gonna go on ships
[2:03:56.840 --> 2:04:00.880]  and go around the world you'll probably die we're men good we'll do it that's
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:06.960]  what men do instead of celebrating that men are like these worker be warrior
[2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:13.000]  ants that go out and build civilization and women are supposed to then try to
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:17.080]  have it all cultured and beautiful and and and you know put their their
[2:04:17.080 --> 2:04:22.040]  panache on it women have decided we want to wait out we want to be in front line
[2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:27.040]  combat okay well the average woman can't carry an 80-pound pack the average
[2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:33.080]  man can't but even less women so they're lower in the pack than 35 pounds and then
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:38.360]  oh women mean more time all women have a higher instance of infection oh you mean
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:41.800]  you don't want to do that great thing I'll be in a foxhole for a month crapping
[2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:47.680]  your helmet but it's it's it's just all beyond that I mean this is the most
[2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:53.160]  pathetic insane left-committing suicide I've ever seen Kathy Griffin's press
[2:04:53.160 --> 2:04:59.440]  conference we got to play more of this coming up I mean this is unbelievable
[2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:06.400]  Builderburg 2017 is kicking off in Chantilly, Virginia this year this is
[2:05:06.400 --> 2:05:09.880]  the first Builderburg meeting since the populist uprisings of Brexit and the

[2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:17.400]  crumbling before their very eyes among some of the subjects of the secret
[2:05:17.400 --> 2:05:22.240]  confab will be the Trump administration and can he be heel also the rise of
[2:05:22.240 --> 2:05:26.480]  populism elites are beginning to fear that their power base may be crumbling
[2:05:26.480 --> 2:05:29.480]  now three members of the current Trump administration are going to be
[2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:34.280]  attending HR McMaster Wilbur Ross and Chris Liddell most Trump insiders
[2:05:34.280 --> 2:05:38.280]  believe that these three are there to help the elites derail the current
[2:05:38.280 --> 2:05:41.720]  administration there are two ways at which this can go either the globals
[2:05:41.720 --> 2:05:45.360]  will try to bring Trump to heel or they will try to impeach him after the 2018

[2:08:08.080 --> 2:08:17.640]  domestic it's Alex Jones I promise I would exit or renegotiate any deal
[2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:25.160]  which fails to serve America's interests many trade deals will soon be
[2:08:25.160 --> 2:08:31.000]  under renegotiation very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:39.200]  but they'll soon be under renegotiation the process has begun from day one but
[2:08:39.200 --> 2:08:43.960]  now we're down to business beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by
[2:08:43.960 --> 2:08:50.720]  the Paris Accord it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the
[2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:58.840]  United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund nice name which calls
[2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:06.000]  for developed countries to send 100 billion dollars to developing countries
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:14.560]  all on top of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments so we're
[2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:19.360]  going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars and we're
[2:09:19.360 --> 2:09:23.920]  already way ahead of anybody else many of the other countries haven't spent
[2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:33.520]  anything and many of them will never pay one dime the Green Fund would likely
[2:09:33.520 --> 2:09:40.360]  obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:50.240]  of which the United States has already handed over one billion dollars nobody
[2:09:50.240 --> 2:10:01.000]  else is even close most of them haven't even paid anything including funds raided
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:07.960]  out of America's budget for the war against terrorism that's where they came
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:15.280]  believe me they didn't come from me they came just before I came into office not
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:24.000]  good and not good the way they took the money in 2015 the United Nations
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:30.920]  departing top climate officials reportedly described the 100 billion
[2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:38.360]  dollars per year as peanuts and stated that the 100 billion dollars is the tail
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:46.640]  that wags the dog in 2015 the Green Climate Funds executive director
[2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:54.280]  reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to 450 billion
[2:10:54.280 --> 2:10:59.240]  dollars per year after 2020 and nobody even knows where the money is going to
[2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:07.240]  nobody's been able to say where is it going to of course the world's top
[2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:15.000]  polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund which we
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:23.480]  terminate America is 20 trillion dollars in debt cash strap cities cannot hire
[2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:30.640]  enough police officers or fix a vital infrastructure millions of our citizens
[2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:38.720]  are out of work and yet under the Paris Accord billions of dollars that ought
[2:11:38.720 --> 2:11:47.000]  to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:55.880]  have taken our factories and our jobs away from us so think of that there are
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:12:01.360]  serious legal and constitutional issues as well that's right foreign leaders in
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:10.280]  Europe Asia and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the
[2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:19.760]  U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives thus our
[2:12:19.760 --> 2:12:26.000]  withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:33.440]  sovereignty what this is rebirth this is it folks we want fair treatment for its
[2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:41.640]  citizens and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers we don't want other
[2:12:41.640 --> 2:12:47.520]  leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore and they won't be they won't
[2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:59.880]  be I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris just
[2:12:59.880 --> 2:13:04.560]  saying that exposes the whole global system it operates in secrecy it
[2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:08.760]  operates in the public never hearing about it oh Bilderberg secret oh TPP is
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:12.600]  being ratified the secret doesn't exist shut up racist hey Obamacare has death
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:17.400]  panels and doubles prices shut up racist grimmer goes on c-span thank god the
[2:13:17.400 --> 2:13:23.480]  public's so dumb it actually triples prices see the whole thing counts on you
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:30.600]  not being engaged but the minute their programs exposed it's over and then it
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:34.480]  starts manifesting people that were patriots all along like Trump for 30 40
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:39.360]  years fighting globalism his dad hated it his lawyer hated it James Leslie
[2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:42.320]  Rawls joins us and then I'm gonna open phones up towards the end of the hour
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:45.280]  I've got some other clips I want to play there's so much big news here but
[2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:50.240]  Bilderberg's beating trying to overthrow Trump he's a best-selling author top
[2:13:50.240 --> 2:13:54.480]  American novelist and blogger known for being a top survivalist survival blog
[2:13:54.480 --> 2:13:59.080]  calm formerly army intelligence really smart analyst great guy I wanted to
[2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:02.880]  just get him on today up because I have you know I'll talk to him on fairies
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:06.560]  busy I'm busy guy just to get his analysis to make sure I'm not off the
[2:14:06.560 --> 2:14:11.960]  off the reservation here but I am actually ashamed of myself that I haven't
[2:14:11.960 --> 2:14:14.920]  supported Trump even stronger when he goes a little bit sideways what do we
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:20.120]  expect me to be completely surrounded in a swamp the killing TPP the 49
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:23.760]  percent down and illegals coming across the border the the whole government and
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:29.300]  rebellion against him all the fake leaks the economy surging back despite
[2:14:29.300 --> 2:14:34.400]  globalists wanting it to be in the tank by now the good Supreme Court justice
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:40.280]  the the second amendment coming back I mean the carbon taxes killed I mean
[2:14:40.280 --> 2:14:45.520]  this is just fabulous and it's real and meanwhile they have gone into his he
[2:14:45.520 --> 2:14:49.240]  fits everywhere saying kill him kill him now my big question is what does he
[2:14:49.240 --> 2:14:52.160]  think of Trump now and what does he think the enemy's gonna do because this
[2:14:52.160 --> 2:14:56.800]  is now reached America's gaining more ground back the last 130 days or
[2:14:56.800 --> 2:15:00.720]  however long Trump's been in how long since January 20th 130 days something
[2:15:00.720 --> 2:15:04.960]  like that in the last 130 days we've gained back more ground for sovereignty
[2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:09.840]  than the last 60 years we lost I mean this is epic and I know it's not just
[2:15:09.840 --> 2:15:13.720]  Trump a lot of the intelligence agencies are patriots a lot of the people in
[2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:18.000]  there knew finally how bad it was because Ron Paul and everybody else and
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:21.960]  Wesley Rawls and Drudge and so many others exposed it we got called Cooke's
[2:15:21.960 --> 2:15:25.360]  we had all came out in the open we were right people actually made the right
[2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:29.080]  decision said you know what they were right screw this I think we've reached
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:33.120]  that moment but then let's not start getting euphoric false flags I smell them
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:37.000]  I mean what are they gonna do to pull their bacon out because as Chorro said
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:41.440]  in the London independent and in their spiegelt yesterday he said world
[2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:46.120]  government's collapsing globalism is in an existential threat we've got to fight
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:50.320]  back and their answers shut us down all the right it's not working though but
[2:15:50.320 --> 2:15:54.120]  the point is we're in a battle James Leslie Rawls what do you think I have
[2:15:54.120 --> 2:15:58.680]  to agree with you I think the globalists are in a downright panic right now
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:03.320]  because for the first time and I don't know how long we have a president who's
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:08.080]  actually keeping the promises he made on a campaign trail and first and foremost
[2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:13.600]  of those was to reassert American sovereignty and to the globalists that's
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:18.360]  that's like someone approaching a vampire with you know garlic and holy
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:22.920]  water and silver cross in their hand they don't want to see that and they
[2:16:22.920 --> 2:16:28.680]  are in panic mode and that's why they are in an all-out effort can you feel the
[2:16:28.680 --> 2:16:32.080]  energy level as well not just intellectually can you feel it James oh
[2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:41.320]  yes absolutely it's it's palpable that the the mass media is willingly and
[2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:47.920]  enthusiastically going after Trump because they see him as a huge threat
[2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:52.600]  because he stands for everything that Hillary Clinton didn't stand and just
[2:16:52.600 --> 2:16:57.880]  rhetorically doing it is powerful but he's actually delivering I can't believe
[2:16:57.880 --> 2:17:03.400]  it's this real can you know I'm I'm very pleased to see that he's been able to
[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:08.880]  implement as much of his agenda as he has it's disappointing to see that the
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:15.520]  courts haven't gone along with him on on vetting immigrants of the state
[2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:21.840]  department's just ignoring him the district or him yeah well he's still
[2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:27.120]  from the executive branch able to accomplish a lot he's pushing as hard as
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:32.000]  he can unfortunately he does not have the full cooperation of Paul Ryan and the
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:35.880]  rhinos in Congress exactly the bottom line I'm not just chilling it's true he
[2:17:35.880 --> 2:17:41.040]  is fighting like a mad devil basically I mean he is throwing everything he's got
[2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:44.460]  against him I just hope he's got the stamina but he seems to be thriving off
[2:17:44.460 --> 2:17:52.200]  of it oh he does he you know he as a former corporate executive thrives on
[2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:59.840]  this level of chaos really it's a it's a very energizing battlefield that he's
[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:05.800]  on and I'm hopeful in fact I'm in prayer that he's able to keep up this
[2:18:05.800 --> 2:18:10.560]  pace all through his first term that's right I know Trump from people that
[2:18:10.560 --> 2:18:13.600]  don't he was always believed in God he just hates fake preachers but he's had a
[2:18:13.600 --> 2:18:17.040]  lot of new more intense spiritual experiences now and that's why he's
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:21.320]  calling on God his wife's calling on God Trump has really changed and there's no
[2:18:21.320 --> 2:18:25.800]  doubt now Trump is clearly anointed to take on the Antichrist system even if
[2:18:25.800 --> 2:18:29.840]  he fails down the road I see there's a precursor to larger battles to come I
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:34.440]  mean I think we're seeing biblical prophecy right now oh I think you're
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:39.840]  right the the signs that we're living in the end times are increasing every day
[2:18:39.840 --> 2:18:44.520]  now I was a little disappointing speaking of end times to see that he
[2:18:44.520 --> 2:18:50.400]  backpedaled a bit on his promise to relocate the US Embassy for Israel from
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:55.320]  Tel Aviv to Jerusalem but the good news is he's promised to revisit that once
[2:18:55.320 --> 2:19:02.080]  every six months and apparently in his face-to-face meeting with a boss he
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:05.520]  actually shouted at a boss and that's the only time I've ever ever seen a
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:11.960]  report of Trump shouting at anyone since he's been in office so it's all it goes
[2:19:11.960 --> 2:19:16.000]  on behind the scenes privately quite a bit but yeah yeah it's obvious he's a
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:21.520]  friend of Israel and I hope that he doesn't have to make too many
[2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:26.680]  compromises when it comes to Middle East peace well he's reportedly has pressed
[2:19:26.680 --> 2:19:32.920]  things to the breaking point apparently yes and again I'm very encouraged
[2:19:32.920 --> 2:19:38.320]  overall with progress I've seen the Trump administration make and while the mass
[2:19:38.320 --> 2:19:47.160]  media has been able to drum out a few folks from the Trump administration the
[2:19:47.160 --> 2:19:52.160]  majority of them are sticking in there you know you've got Steve Bannon and
[2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:55.600]  Kellyanne Conway who are hanging in there sure think of the pressure they're
[2:19:55.600 --> 2:19:58.960]  under think about my crew two folks that pray for them this is this is not this

[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:57.720]  Kathy Griffin press conference that was the worst acting like if you were
[2:24:57.720 --> 2:25:03.120]  teaching first-year film students in college how to do fake crying how to
[2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:06.800]  look disingenuous how to look fake it would be Kathy Grevin
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:12.240]  the men signed my checks and then they just wanted to simulate killing the
[2:25:12.240 --> 2:25:17.560]  president they backlash man what's saying is I want to go around and be
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:22.320]  aggressive and attack people and then not hear Trump say what you did is
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:26.680]  deplorable and disgusting you ought to be ashamed yourself oh my gosh I want to
[2:25:26.680 --> 2:25:31.080]  be violent I want to call for violence I want to you know take the battlefield
[2:25:31.080 --> 2:25:34.360]  my dress in high heels with a battle axe and just have them in stretch their
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:41.960]  necks out for us she's got Gloria Allred's daughter fluttering around
[2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:45.640]  behind her another publicity stunt as if any of this does anything getting on
[2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:49.320]  TV for no reason I mean this is some of the most unincredible comedy I've ever
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:55.760]  seen it's coming up but James Leslie Rawls getting past the Trump worship
[2:25:55.760 --> 2:26:00.040]  fest it's not that we should be happy for the success we're seeing right now
[2:26:00.040 --> 2:26:05.320]  survival blog comms your website geopolitically though Ron Paul was on a
[2:26:05.320 --> 2:26:09.120]  month ago or so he said yeah Trump should a great job of the economy but it
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:12.840]  may be too little too late because it's global do you think he can head off a lot
[2:26:12.840 --> 2:26:17.080]  of the bad financial numbers we see globally no I don't think he can and
[2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:24.440]  in fact if you step back and look at this from a grand scale the global
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:30.240]  economy has been in the opening opening stages of a multi-decade
[2:26:30.240 --> 2:26:40.000]  long depression that started in the year 2000 and I think that he is not going to
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:45.160]  be able to stop those macro level economic forces but certainly within
[2:26:45.160 --> 2:26:50.080]  the United States he could do a lot to revitalize the economy certainly with
[2:26:50.080 --> 2:26:55.120]  his tax plans just by themselves I think we'll have a chance there but the
[2:26:55.120 --> 2:27:00.760]  level of global indebtedness that's grown up over the last 50 years is pretty
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:05.000]  well inescapable I think we're going to see a global debt crisis that'll make
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:11.320]  the 2007-2008 crisis look very small by comparison before it's over so Trump
[2:27:11.320 --> 2:27:18.880]  won't be able to stop that but he can do a lot to support the US dollar as a
[2:27:18.880 --> 2:27:25.080]  strong currency by reducing taxes by reducing the federal debt and he's
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:28.640]  already going the long way toward that
[2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:31.960]  we want to break it a few minutes but let me start asking this question now
[2:27:31.960 --> 2:27:36.280]  you're an expert on relocation we were talking about this a decade ago but now
[2:27:36.280 --> 2:27:40.440]  it's in every major big publication that elites are getting these fortresses these
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:47.040]  armored keeps these castles in remote areas of Tasmania off the coast of
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:52.960]  Australia or the Cook Islands or areas the middle of Eastern Europe or they're
[2:27:52.960 --> 2:27:59.000]  running to remote islands of Hawaii like Hawaii I mean they know something big
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:02.440]  is coming and now the publications are saying it's coming what do you think's
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:07.760]  behind that well I think you can't suppress the truth too long and a lot
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:14.600]  of people who who've made an honest living and have built up pretty large
[2:28:14.600 --> 2:28:20.480]  fortunes for their families are seeing the handwriting on the wall and they're
[2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:25.000]  developing an exit exit strategy you can't blame them for doing so most of
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:29.160]  these folks you know the Peter Theels of the world are forward-thinking
[2:28:29.160 --> 2:28:35.560]  individuals they are they have a good-sized budget they can they can
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:40.400]  think through the chain of events that's going to happen again it all goes
[2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:45.040]  back to global debt it's the main trigger for all of this and you can't
[2:28:45.040 --> 2:28:50.600]  blame them for building themselves well stocked retreats offshore and there's a
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:56.040]  lot in my consulting business I've won a few across quite a few millionaires
[2:28:56.040 --> 2:28:59.600]  who are building retreats right here in the United States you can't blame them
[2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:06.000]  for doing so and I think individual citizens of this nation should wake up
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:09.800]  to what's happening and realize they can make some preparations of their own on
[2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:13.640]  a very modest budget and in the next segment I'd love to talk about that
[2:29:13.640 --> 2:29:21.080]  let's do that because you look at Venezuela as wealthy as the United
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:26.880]  States 55 years ago in mainline economic journals now a veritable
[2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:33.760]  road warrior Mad Max scenario and and it's only getting worse so I'm gonna
[2:29:33.760 --> 2:29:39.520]  look at our future through the lens of Venezuela I think the establishment
[2:29:39.520 --> 2:29:42.800]  doesn't want to the Venezuelan route they want a pure authoritarian regime for
[2:29:42.800 --> 2:29:49.280]  controlled implosion but Trump is sabotaging that with a soft landing
[2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:58.680]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:30:00.920 --> 2:30:06.120]  remember when we used to say if you think the liberals hate Donald Trump now
[2:30:06.120 --> 2:30:11.400]  just wait until he delivers on his campaign promises well guess what it's
[2:30:11.400 --> 2:30:16.400]  happening and the liberals are losing their freaking minds what could be
[2:30:16.400 --> 2:30:21.560]  defined and construed as a dark speech this will be the day that the United
[2:30:21.560 --> 2:30:26.120]  States resigned as the leader of the free war I have such rage and sadness we
[2:30:26.120 --> 2:30:30.120]  just watched a dangerous little man give a very very scary speech Michael Moore
[2:30:30.120 --> 2:30:35.560]  called it a crime against humanity and bet Miller tweeted that there has never
[2:30:35.560 --> 2:30:40.680]  in US history been such a destructive and megalomaniac in the White House as
[2:30:40.680 --> 2:30:47.760]  Donald Trump news flash to liberals 60 million plus Americans voted for Trump
[2:30:47.760 --> 2:30:53.680]  because of his campaign promises and the president is delivering based on real

[2:33:53.400 --> 2:33:57.160]  Soros admittedly is funding that they admit they're engaged in I don't get
[2:33:57.160 --> 2:34:03.000]  how they're allowed to engage in such mass organization for sedition because
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:06.520]  they're trying to overthrow the Republic we have peacefully gone in by
[2:34:06.520 --> 2:34:10.920]  educating the public and and had a counter-revolution peacefully to get a
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:14.960]  beachhead in Washington to start changing things but that's only in the
[2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:19.920]  locale and America is the best house in a bad neighborhood as James Rosie
[2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:23.280]  Rawls was saying earlier and all the top economists I talked to concur with what
[2:34:23.280 --> 2:34:28.880]  he just said Trump could maybe get us into a decent position but then if
[2:34:28.880 --> 2:34:33.280]  things implode outside the country it's gonna get bad and listen you take the
[2:34:33.280 --> 2:34:37.280]  millennials not all of them but a lot of them totally spoiled entitled a lot of
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:41.080]  the public is absolutely pissed off brainwashed they're ready to burn
[2:34:41.080 --> 2:34:45.440]  everything down black white doesn't matter I mean I have leftist all over
[2:34:45.440 --> 2:34:47.960]  just walk up to me and say the most incredible threats and it'll be like
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:52.280]  some 150 pound guy and I'm not even being threatened I'm like dude you're you
[2:34:52.280 --> 2:34:55.360]  understand this isn't a simulation this isn't a video game you're talking to a
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:35:00.160]  250 pound guy okay who's almost pure muscle I'm not saying I'm the toughest
[2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:03.040]  guy around but I mean you know you're writing checks you're mad you're you
[2:35:03.040 --> 2:35:08.440]  know that your body can't cash and that's what's so crazy about watching
[2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:11.600]  these people that are not in the real world lights almost like they're
[2:35:11.600 --> 2:35:16.440]  emerging into the real world as the MSM crashes as globalism crashes as the
[2:35:16.440 --> 2:35:21.480]  people awaken there's those that were so in the system they just kind of halfway
[2:35:21.480 --> 2:35:25.680]  awakened but then defend the system because they see it collapsing but the
[2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:31.720]  system was designed to collapse and bring in a technocracy they think Trump and
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:35.200]  James Leslie Rawls are collapsing it because we're not agreeing with it
[2:35:35.200 --> 2:35:39.480]  when we're actually trying to build a future because we don't want to evacuate
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:43.160]  to Kauai even though it's looking better every day so I'm going to James Leslie
[2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:46.360]  Rawls in a moment survivalblog.com talk about how the elites are getting
[2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:50.640]  prepared why they're getting out where he sees this going and hopefully there's
[2:35:50.640 --> 2:35:53.120]  some way to turn this around some people say well are we supposed to evacuate
[2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:56.520]  we're all screwed or is Trump making things better I don't know why some
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:36:02.520]  people get confused by multifaceted multivariate systems offense defense
[2:36:02.520 --> 2:36:09.560]  north south east west leisure time work time you know I'm hoping to fix the
[2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:15.800]  country but I'm also more and more you know I see positive signs looking for
[2:36:15.800 --> 2:36:21.080]  ways to protect my family that's normal like getting insurance doesn't mean I
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:25.880]  want to get sick I have the insurance and so there's a lot bigger things than
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:30.880]  trusting in some insurance company trusting in yourself your family friends
[2:36:30.880 --> 2:36:33.760]  you can trust and you know those of us that are real we tend to get really real
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:36.680]  with our families and friends we're not in zombie mode it's fun to be in a zombie
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:39.640]  mode then we kind of get mean to our friends mean to our family sometimes
[2:36:39.640 --> 2:36:43.960]  because things are so intense we tend to be more aggressive with those we trust
[2:36:43.960 --> 2:36:47.480]  because they're actually awake you're telling them your innermost secrets they
[2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:50.880]  then think oh my god you don't care about me because you're so angry it's the
[2:36:50.880 --> 2:36:54.800]  opposite I'm being real with you the audience because I care about you and
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:37:00.760]  I'm hoping you can save us that's why I'm so desperate I'm trying as hard as I
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:05.160]  can to the point of exhaustion I'm not complaining I'm just saying I can't

[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:11.000]  back to James Wesley Rawls I know you talk about the general public and get
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:15.400]  prepared and I know they should be with water filtration and but I think just be
[2:40:15.400 --> 2:40:20.520]  prepared now don't eat GMO reach out in your community but having an escape
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:24.520]  route out of these big cities if you're in LA if you're in Chicago if you're
[2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:27.960]  in what let me ask you this one of the top survivors in the world formerly
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:31.400]  army intelligence James Wesley Rawls bestsellingauthorsofallablog.com
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:35.880]  let me ask you this what are the most dangerous places in the United States to
[2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:38.800]  live and where would you live because the average person's got to have a job
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:43.320]  they got to you know pay for themselves. Well obviously that I think the most
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:48.520]  dangerous places are the major population centers so all up and down the
[2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:55.000]  east coast and then the LA metropolitan area and to a lesser extent perhaps
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:41:00.640]  Dallas Fort Worth but certainly Chicago that entire metropolitan region that
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:06.800]  stretches for many many miles you don't want to be in a major population center
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:12.160]  and even if you're in the suburbs things could be very difficult and downright
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:16.280]  dangerous for you if you have the opportunity I recommend that all your
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:20.840]  viewers and listeners consider relocating to a lightly populated food
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:26.320]  producing region whether that's a farming region or ranching region but in
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:30.760]  either case it has to be well removed from major population centers because
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:35.680]  that's where the terrorist targets are that's where if there's ever a clamp
[2:41:35.680 --> 2:41:41.680]  down or martial law that's where it will occur and that's where people are the
[2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:50.160]  most vulnerable because the chains of supply I terminate at those major
[2:41:50.160 --> 2:41:54.480]  metropolitan regions you want to be in an area where food is produced and where
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:42:01.080]  power is produced and the exports you don't want to be in the area in a big
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:05.920]  city where they import power import food import water that's where you're the
[2:42:05.920 --> 2:42:09.600]  most vulnerable and of course breakdown from the historical research the
[2:42:09.600 --> 2:42:13.320]  Pentagon's done the British have done the same obviously even more zones but
[2:42:13.320 --> 2:42:17.240]  what is it 10 days most people become killers five days most people comes
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:24.000]  thieves 10 days killers 15 cannibals it could come down to that very easily we
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:28.320]  have and we have a society where the average family only has a three-day
[2:42:28.320 --> 2:42:33.480]  supply of food on hand and that's why I highly recommend that everyone listening
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:38.680]  to my voice right now seriously consider stocking up for your family and not
[2:42:38.680 --> 2:42:43.440]  just food but you'll need water filtration and you'll also need supplements
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:49.960]  because storage food just by its very nature is not as nutritionally rich as
[2:42:49.960 --> 2:42:55.920]  fresh foods so you'll need supplements you'll need water filtration and you'll
[2:42:55.920 --> 2:43:02.600]  need plenty of bulk storage food and stock up deep folks that the deeper your
[2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:09.680]  larder the safer you'll be what else are you looking at the concerns you're on
[2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:17.600]  the world well well mainly the economy is my main concern because that's
[2:43:17.600 --> 2:43:21.880]  something that is going to come back and bite us regardless of what happens
[2:43:21.880 --> 2:43:25.720]  with the Trump administration because we're in a global economy there's
[2:43:25.720 --> 2:43:32.800]  massive levels of debt that have built up both public and private and eventually
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:37.360]  that's going to come back and bite us and when it does we need to be prepared
[2:43:37.360 --> 2:43:42.960]  as families and we need to be in a position where we can make a difference
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:47.120]  and if if someone is worried about where they're going to find their next meal
[2:43:47.120 --> 2:43:50.880]  for their family they're not innocent they haven't put themselves in a
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:54.040]  situation where they're looking at the big picture and where they really can
[2:43:54.040 --> 2:43:58.960]  make a difference in terms of helping to rebuild society and being politically
[2:43:58.960 --> 2:44:03.200]  active and aware if you're scrambling for your next meal you're not part of the
[2:44:03.200 --> 2:44:06.840]  solution you're part of the problem that's right during a breakdown or
[2:44:06.840 --> 2:44:11.360]  crisis it's those that are already secure that become the de facto leaders and
[2:44:11.360 --> 2:44:15.800]  the globalist always have used collapse as a tool to bring in control that's the
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:19.960]  globalist model we have to be at the micro level prepared so that we can
[2:44:19.960 --> 2:44:23.520]  provide the leadership not because we want power but because locally we better
[2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:28.080]  be involved in the new leadership or we will be dominated by some outside
[2:44:28.080 --> 2:44:33.280]  collapsed super city that will then reorganize kind of into a warlord type
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:36.920]  scenario so we're not ready for that a year after we move to the country after
[2:44:36.920 --> 2:44:41.080]  a collapse and think we're safe there'll be a whole armored column coming on the
[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:46.880]  road to take over your town right yeah I think it's important that we have we
[2:44:46.880 --> 2:44:50.840]  need to recognize that the solutions to these problems are going to come from
[2:44:50.840 --> 2:44:55.520]  the grassroots from the bottom up in terms of restoring the Constitution and
[2:44:55.520 --> 2:45:02.160]  restoring a sound currency and rebuilding a vibrant economy that's
[2:45:02.160 --> 2:45:05.040]  exactly this could actually be a positive thing like the black plague that
[2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:07.640]  I'm not endorsing to kill out the population roughly of Europe the
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:10.640]  Renaissance came out of that because it wiped out all the corrupt elites all
[2:45:10.640 --> 2:45:13.840]  the state systems that wouldn't let people have a free market it forced the
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:18.080]  population back to their original roots and created the whole new economy right
[2:45:18.080 --> 2:45:23.920]  so folks wake up and once you once you're awake and aware with the
[2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:28.080]  information you have that you learned from info wars you need to stock up and
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:34.560]  team up and train up to be ready for this it's it's just common sense it's
[2:45:34.560 --> 2:45:40.560]  biblical and it's something that can be done on a fairly modest budget let me
[2:45:40.560 --> 2:45:44.240]  ask you this just selfishly because I look at these things why are some of
[2:45:44.240 --> 2:45:48.040]  the elites moving to say kawaii or other very remote Hawaiian islands why are
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:50.440]  they moving to Tasmania because the word is that's where a lot of them are
[2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:53.720]  going they're not on beaches they're getting hilltop deals putting 20 foot
[2:45:53.720 --> 2:45:58.520]  walls in you know putting machine guns in putting food in helicopter pads why
[2:45:58.520 --> 2:46:02.600]  are they running to the Pacific Ocean well the I the advantage of the
[2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:06.800]  island nations is that there they have the ultimate in geographic isolation
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:14.360]  also they have independent power and of course in Hawaii they're they're dependent
[2:46:14.360 --> 2:46:21.000]  upon shiploads of liquefied natural gas arriving but an individual compound or
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:25.040]  bunker can be very well stocked for years and if there's going to be a
[2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:30.040]  population die off if you're on an island that is not too heavily populated to
[2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:35.400]  begin with you're probably going to be sitting pretty now not everyone has the
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:39.480]  budget to make that kind of move and again kawaii Hawaii is the most remote
[2:46:39.480 --> 2:46:42.920]  islands in the world kawaii is the most remote of the remote and again I'm just
[2:46:42.920 --> 2:46:46.480]  telling people I've done my own study that's where the big bunnies moving right
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:53.560]  but even even though the the I wouldn't want to be anywhere near Oahu because
[2:46:53.560 --> 2:46:57.560]  it's grossly overpopulated exactly it's it's probably the worst time bomb there
[2:46:57.560 --> 2:47:01.720]  is they say right it's grossly overpopulated but the big island and
[2:47:01.720 --> 2:47:07.320]  kawaii would be quite survivable at least at least the the dry side of the
[2:47:07.320 --> 2:47:13.160]  big island the helo area might see some serious chaos but the dry side the
[2:47:13.160 --> 2:47:16.040]  western side of the big island let's blow that that's why I love about you
[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:19.600]  rolls I got nobody on but you and say Joel scowls the nose basically every
[2:47:19.600 --> 2:47:23.760]  area of the world let's blow that up yeah helos of that spot big islands man like
[2:47:23.760 --> 2:47:26.960]  a wasteland with the volcano but it's got a bunch of ranches up on top so the
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:29.640]  biggest in the world are there but go look at kawaii I'm not trying to
[2:47:29.640 --> 2:47:34.040]  advertise this folks but I personally if I'm gonna have to escape it obviously
[2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:37.200]  will be some fancy redoubt but I'm looking at kawaii let's let's let the
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:41.160]  it's even further north north northwest there guys this is the furthest most
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:47.760]  island then you've got the Amish slash super hardcore Calvinist that 170 years
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:51.360]  ago went and bought that from the king fair and square that's called the
[2:47:51.360 --> 2:47:57.760]  forbidden island that most westerly there that island it literally has about
[2:47:57.760 --> 2:48:01.800]  200 people that live on it that is just west of kawaii what do you make of the
[2:48:01.800 --> 2:48:07.200]  forbidden island of Hawaii well it's only open to native Hawaiians and I
[2:48:07.200 --> 2:48:11.800]  certainly if I was with an NGO or something operating there I wouldn't
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:15.680]  actually feel very comfortable living there in in the midst of a collapse
[2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:23.800]  there's probably a handful of non-native Hawaiians on the the so-called
[2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:31.240]  forbidden island it's actually pretty self-sufficient as as would be kawaii if
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:35.960]  everything fell apart but again most people's budgets aren't gonna allow them
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:40.600]  to move to Hawaii or to Tasmania or wherever no no I totally agree I
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:44.000]  actually investigate that island but that's true they also have day hunting
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:48.600]  trips for like Hawaiian sheep and wild hogs but yeah and you think about how big
[2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:52.720]  kawaii is that that island's a third the size of it it's gigantic it's the size
[2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:59.040]  of like Dallas and there's like 200 people on it yeah yeah it would be very
[2:48:59.040 --> 2:49:04.600]  survivable in in the Pacific the island nations that I like the best are
[2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:13.560]  Vanuatu, Nui and the Cook Islands and partly because at least on Vanuatu you
[2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:20.160]  can you can actually own a gun and it has a fairly small unobtrusive
[2:49:20.160 --> 2:49:26.760]  government and the economies of all three of those island nations are such
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:34.200]  that they can revert to a subsistence level of agriculture and fishing in the
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:38.800]  event of a global collapse and they're not grossly overpopulated like some other
[2:49:38.800 --> 2:49:44.920]  islands it's amazing I got to say kawaii is so pretty that's where they film all
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:49.400]  the King Kong Jurassic Park movies it's crazy have you ever been there actually
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:54.640]  I've been to the big island I haven't been to kawaii but if you look at it
[2:49:54.640 --> 2:50:01.560]  demographically and in terms of square acres per person yeah you know if you're
[2:50:01.560 --> 2:50:07.960]  gonna go back to a pigs and poi economy you could do that on kawaii you can
[2:50:07.960 --> 2:50:12.360]  they got tobacco coffee bananas what everything there you literally it's a
[2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:17.200]  self-sufficiency islands it's just amazing you go walk through you know
[2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:21.160]  people's yards much less the jungle there are mangoes papayas guavas
[2:50:21.160 --> 2:50:27.880]  everything is there if you starve aren't any populated islands of Hawaii you're
[2:50:27.880 --> 2:50:31.760]  a fool that's why there's symbols of rooster there are chickens everywhere yeah
[2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:38.960]  and and a lot of families raise pigs there's all sorts of poultry there's
[2:50:38.960 --> 2:50:43.840]  when I liked is the Hawaiians there are like really into being anti-establishment
[2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:50.480]  almost all of them are listeners really so I think if folks have the
[2:50:50.480 --> 2:50:55.240]  opportunity to relocate if they're self-employed or whatever the islands
[2:50:55.240 --> 2:51:01.120]  are something to consider stay right there let's come right back being
[2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:04.720]  self-reliant is about being prepared and to do what you need to have your own

[2:54:50.960 --> 2:54:56.160]  should apologize to her talk about an insane doubling down well should Trump

[2:55:03.080 --> 2:55:07.680]  Griffin thinks thinks comedy should go all out Kathy Griffin's comments should

[2:55:29.920 --> 2:55:39.600]  ahead of the game ahead of the game wow it's from a woman that is a failure so
[2:55:39.600 --> 2:55:43.040]  the doubling the tripling down that's why she's the poster child of the
[2:55:43.040 --> 2:55:47.000]  arrogance of the left so you should we have the two new shirts added today part

[2:55:50.960 --> 2:55:56.200]  info wars comment on air 2500 I want I can't wait said the videos to contest
[2:55:56.200 --> 2:55:59.960]  info wars comm I can't wait to see this ball rolling like Bill Clinton's a
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:04.560]  rapist fourth hour was sort of it's coming up James Wesley Rawls best-selling
[2:56:04.560 --> 2:56:09.160]  author researchers of all blog comm you warn decades ago of radical Islam taking
[2:56:09.160 --> 2:56:12.320]  over the left allied with it now it's out in the open you've written books on
[2:56:12.320 --> 2:56:18.000]  the subject looking at that in other areas will Trump be able to defeat this
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:24.000]  leftist alliance with Islam I believe that he at least be able to hold
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  America's ground in that regard Obama was conceding left right and center and
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:35.880]  basically in fact literally bowing to them well he was coordinating the
[2:56:35.880 --> 2:56:42.000]  Arab Spring right so at least Trump is gonna do his best to hold his ground and
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:48.920]  I think that even with the rising tide of Islam we have the opportunity for
[2:56:48.920 --> 2:56:53.520]  America to be an example to the rest of the world and you just said it you're
[2:56:53.520 --> 2:56:57.080]  always just crystallizing so quickly when I can't we got to hold our ground
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:01.800]  that's all it's going to take is hold the ground certainly because I think that
[2:57:01.800 --> 2:57:09.440]  Islam eventually will collapse in on itself into infighting between Sunni
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:14.640]  and Shia I was about to say the Civil War will decimate their population it I
[2:57:14.640 --> 2:57:19.240]  think it will so folks we need to hold our ground as individual families as
[2:57:19.240 --> 2:57:24.440]  well and please do your best to support Info Wars and one of the best ways you
[2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:29.400]  can do that is buying your supplements from Info Wars that's one thing every

[2:59:20.040 --> 2:59:24.320]  Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight there's a reason the
[2:59:24.320 --> 2:59:28.200]  Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced
[2:59:28.200 --> 2:59:32.800]  lightweight armor it works. Defender Body Armor is made right here in America
[2:59:32.800 --> 2:59:36.240]  and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from
[2:59:36.240 --> 2:59:40.720]  an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory. Defender Body Armor is now available
[2:59:40.720 --> 2:59:45.360]  through InfoWarsStore.com so you can defend yourself your family and finance
[2:59:45.360 --> 2:59:51.720]  the Info War against the Globalist all at the same time a total 360 win.
[2:59:52.960 --> 2:59:58.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:58.360 --> 3:00:10.720]  The Globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they
[3:00:10.720 --> 3:00:17.080]  end up on top. The truth is humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above
[3:00:17.080 --> 3:00:21.040]  them on our journey to hell.
[3:00:21.040 --> 3:00:24.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:24.880 --> 3:00:29.520]  Okay I don't like to crash Mike Cernovich because I got a lot of work to do and I
[3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:32.720]  like to listen to him walking around the office on my iPhone plugged into my
[3:00:32.720 --> 3:00:36.080]  earpieces while I'm doing stuff but I'm gonna be out in 15 minutes because he's
[3:00:36.080 --> 3:00:38.920]  got a guest coming up and lots of cover but I really need to play these clips
[3:00:38.920 --> 3:00:41.920]  that we got for you that nobody else has even talked about.
[3:00:41.920 --> 3:00:45.960]  Megan Kelly the Russians had her over to host big forums and interview Putin she
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:48.480]  told me about it two weeks ago asked me not to tell anybody but now that
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:52.560]  interviews out there she just attacks them and you know it just acts like a
[3:00:52.560 --> 3:00:57.360]  crazy person and Putin just slams her down those clips are coming up it's up
[3:00:57.360 --> 3:01:02.480]  on info wars.com and then we've got this this this you know cut the
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:08.280]  president's head off lady Kathy Griffin doubling down and saying she's a victim of
[3:01:08.280 --> 3:01:12.120]  men they write her paychecks and the president should apologize to her then
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:19.320]  we found this quote of her in December six months ago saying quote so I'm happy
[3:01:19.320 --> 3:01:23.280]  to deliver beat down to Donald Trump and also to Barron you know a lot of comics
[3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:27.280]  are going to the hard for Donald my edges I'm gonna go direct for Barron I'm
[3:01:27.280 --> 3:01:32.920]  going to get in ahead of the game so she's now attacking Barron the president
[3:01:32.920 --> 3:01:37.800]  in the fakest crying I've ever seen I do think the left is committing suicide I
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:42.920]  mean these are the biggest ball brass Mike Sernovich what is going on yeah I
[3:01:42.920 --> 3:01:48.520]  love it the I love what Kathy Griffin did today she did a great thing for the
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:52.920]  movement to show that they are they have no contrition they have no human
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:01:59.160]  decency she ran didn't raid so what had happened is that as you knew you found
[3:01:59.160 --> 3:02:04.920]  out that Kathy Griffin and liberals will bully an 11-year-old child Rosie
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:10.600]  O'Donnell remember she spread that video oh Barron he's autistic trying to mock
[3:02:10.600 --> 3:02:16.320]  him right yes they all go go after our children which is what you have been
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:19.720]  saying for years and I've been saying for years it's one thing well I mean look
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:23.000]  what the media did to you with your court battle and stuff your children will
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:26.400]  have to read that for years I don't care if they come after me or you or
[3:02:26.400 --> 3:02:30.000]  anybody else but they're going after our children by the way when I basically
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:36.280]  won the court battle the children one it's coming in the news exactly and that
[3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:42.160]  is because they children aren't off limits now even in the mafia even in
[3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:47.160]  organized crime you never go after another person's child the left they
[3:02:47.160 --> 3:02:51.480]  don't even have the ethics of the mafia that's because they're disconnected it's
[3:02:51.480 --> 3:02:55.160]  not the mafia or whims why get people's kids in on it they're not involved
[3:02:55.160 --> 3:03:00.520]  leave the kids out let men do the fighting this is pussy world yeah when
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:03.680]  they don't have any morality and this is what happens in a world without a
[3:03:03.680 --> 3:03:09.360]  mooring to God to religion to Western civilization where they they can't
[3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:14.640]  understand that okay adults who are in the game you can go after them hard
[3:03:14.640 --> 3:03:21.400]  oh speaking of speaking of children my child is going to come up and grab
[3:03:21.400 --> 3:03:26.560]  wrap around she wants to she wants to talk to the to the info word yeah we
[3:03:26.560 --> 3:03:31.280]  have a young info warrior there right right in the back so that's the thing
[3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:34.760]  that they don't even they don't even think that children are off limits yeah
[3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:40.880]  house actually we had Easter brunch with siren on TV I got three dollars we are
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:44.960]  right right it's all this stuff what's going on so you know sire got to meet
[3:03:44.960 --> 3:03:48.440]  the great Alex Jones yeah the Kathy Griffin stuff it showed that they are
[3:03:48.440 --> 3:03:52.280]  they've completely lost their minds but here's an interesting thing I've heard
[3:03:52.280 --> 3:03:56.120]  from a lot of liberal people a lot of them and said you know what Sernovich
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:00.880]  you and Alex Jones and other people we hate to admit it but you guys are right
[3:04:00.880 --> 3:04:04.600]  that we've gone too far and we really need to do something about these these
[3:04:04.600 --> 3:04:08.320]  left-wing parents not because they want to admit that they know it's hurting them
[3:04:08.320 --> 3:04:10.980]  like that's why they have Zarkaria coming out it's why they've got the
[3:04:10.980 --> 3:04:14.680]  New York Times coming out where they have no whites weekends at colleges I mean
[3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:19.480]  this is crazy yeah they've gone too far and now they're losing influence and
[3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:23.160]  they can't win an election remember they're they're over five so the fake
[3:04:23.160 --> 3:04:26.760]  news media wants the info warriors to feel like we're the ones being beaten
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:32.040]  down and get in the bunkers but there have been five special elections since
[3:04:32.040 --> 3:04:36.560]  Trump was elected they've lost all five and like you said they have these
[3:04:36.560 --> 3:04:40.440]  bird-doggers get in the guy's face he throws them down he got elected because
[3:04:40.440 --> 3:04:45.760]  he kicked the guy's ass yeah so they're over five the fake news media is going
[3:04:45.760 --> 3:04:50.720]  oh my god the Democrats are energized the bases energized no they're not they
[3:04:50.720 --> 3:04:56.800]  are completely losing the plot and Kathy Griffin is a signpost he's their
[3:04:56.800 --> 3:05:02.920]  tombstone we'll be back with Mike Cernovich well folks it seems like life
[3:05:02.920 --> 3:05:07.240]  on the d-list our decapitation list isn't what it's all cracked up to be
[3:05:07.240 --> 3:05:11.760]  you've seen the now infamous images of comedian Kathy Griffin holding up the
[3:05:11.760 --> 3:05:15.800]  mock head of Donald Trump and you see the endless news stories of her
[3:05:15.800 --> 3:05:20.040]  apologizing her being called out by the left and right and losing some of her
[3:05:20.040 --> 3:05:24.480]  lucrative paying gigs that's right Kathy Griffin's gonna hold a press conference
[3:05:24.480 --> 3:05:28.800]  to complain about bullying from the Trump family she should be lucky people are
[3:05:28.800 --> 3:05:33.640]  even talking about her and now we see the true response of the liberals I'm a
[3:05:33.640 --> 3:05:37.400]  victim during this press conference they're also going to announce her
[3:05:37.400 --> 3:05:41.520]  true motivation behind the photo shoot well it doesn't really matter what your
[3:05:41.520 --> 3:05:45.400]  motivation was Kathy that's a mute point at this time please for the sake of

[3:08:14.960 --> 3:08:22.200]  guesting worldwide here's the deal I wasn't brought up a liberal or a
[3:08:22.200 --> 3:08:26.600]  conservative I was brought up smiling one live in America and be free and I
[3:08:26.600 --> 3:08:30.400]  love the animating contest of Liberty and now you look at the bullying
[3:08:30.400 --> 3:08:36.560]  terroristic left everywhere every day saying kill Trump murderous family MSNBC
[3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:39.880]  analysts we had to play that clip I played that week saying blow up Trump
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:44.760]  towers ISIS please we say you could on national TV and you ask a terrorist
[3:08:44.760 --> 3:08:48.200]  organization to hit something you're now aiding and abetting them that's what
[3:08:48.200 --> 3:08:54.720]  ISIS does is use media I would be arrested in a day and I should be but I
[3:08:54.720 --> 3:09:00.400]  don't so they flip-flop and twist around how I want violence and how
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:08.040]  Sernovich wants it we're hoping for peace preparing for war and I'm gonna get
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:10.920]  out of here the same way she's got a guest come out a lot to cover but
[3:09:10.920 --> 3:09:13.880]  Kathy Griffith has come out and said I'm so happy to deliver beat down to
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:18.480]  Donald Trump and also to Baron you know a lot of comics are going to go hard for
[3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:22.480]  Donald my edges that I'll go direct for Baron I'm going to get in ahead of the
[3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:27.160]  game she got a press conference I'm gonna play a few clips of here in just a
[3:09:27.160 --> 3:09:32.920]  moment but Mike Sernovich I don't want to be overconfident I agree they're
[3:09:32.920 --> 3:09:36.400]  killing themselves politically they're falling apart New York Times reads
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:40.600]  Arkaria Washington Post are going over being too vicious we should back off
[3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:45.560]  only because their own true spirit is discrediting them and they can't help it
[3:09:45.560 --> 3:09:49.600]  and they're getting more and more wild but I almost like them openly saying they
[3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:53.040]  hate America and hate families and love Islam at least they're not creeping
[3:09:53.040 --> 3:09:56.560]  around behind the scenes doing it I don't think they can control themselves
[3:09:56.560 --> 3:10:02.560]  because this is losers an existential battle for dominance and primacy when
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:06.240]  we all know beta is trying to be dominant is the greatest train wreck
[3:10:06.240 --> 3:10:11.800]  history's ever seen so how do you see this was jar vomitorium moving forward
[3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:16.840]  yeah they show their true colors and their violent nature and that is why
[3:10:16.840 --> 3:10:20.280]  again they've lost every special election that's happened since Trump has been
[3:10:20.280 --> 3:10:25.400]  elected there's a major revolt against a power lead and they're freaking out so
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:30.120]  you're right in a way though in the way I'm not worried about us becoming
[3:10:30.120 --> 3:10:34.040]  complacent because the great thing about the media lying about us is people
[3:10:34.040 --> 3:10:37.440]  more are more fired up than ever I mean think about this for a minute like when
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:41.960]  the Kathy Griffin thing happened right away we have a battle plan t-shirts
[3:10:41.960 --> 3:10:48.080]  contest get people up there MSM is terrorism info wars calm we have a
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:52.120]  whole strategy laid out so whatever the enemy attacks us and I do think of this
[3:10:52.120 --> 3:10:56.880]  is war every time the enemy attacks us now we know right away how to go into a
[3:10:56.880 --> 3:11:00.520]  battle plan because they've been attacking us for so long meanwhile they
[3:11:00.520 --> 3:11:04.960]  don't know how to respond to us we haven't been on the offense forever
[3:11:04.960 --> 3:11:09.160]  they don't we're used to being attacked they can't stand it and the more they
[3:11:09.160 --> 3:11:13.840]  attack us the stronger we get they don't know what to do exactly right so now
[3:11:13.840 --> 3:11:18.160]  we're finally on the offensive we said you know what because you know you and
[3:11:18.160 --> 3:11:24.280]  me and others we want free speech but they all go after us so we said all
[3:11:24.280 --> 3:11:27.600]  right if this is the way you really want to play it we're gonna get that
[3:11:27.600 --> 3:11:32.640]  Kathy Griffin fired by CNN we will make this happen this has never been
[3:11:32.640 --> 3:11:36.240]  happened nobody in conventional conservative media they're all trying to
[3:11:36.240 --> 3:11:40.280]  take credit for it that was an info warriors thing and Alex Jones saying a
[3:11:40.280 --> 3:11:44.600]  center bitch saying a social media all the great people which true is that's
[3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:48.560]  why the credit again goes to everybody listening everybody pins up the
[3:11:48.560 --> 3:11:53.160]  telephone why is CNN hiring a terrorist why do they have somebody who supports
[3:11:53.160 --> 3:11:58.880]  ISIS on their show if just me or you ranting and raving to the computer it's
[3:11:58.880 --> 3:12:04.240]  nothing it's nothing it's the chain reaction of the audience and their passion
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:09.480]  is an energy source that's unstoppable yeah Al Franken even pulled out of the
[3:12:09.480 --> 3:12:13.960]  Kathy Griffin show after you and I said we are gonna hold a big protest so maybe
[3:12:13.960 --> 3:12:17.400]  people out you know I know that you don't like to do your own horn this isn't
[3:12:17.400 --> 3:12:22.440]  about ego but what a lot of people don't know is that Al Franken had said well I
[3:12:22.440 --> 3:12:26.560]  don't care I'm still gonna do the event with Kathy Griffin so then I tweeted out
[3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:32.120]  all right we're gonna hold a big protest at this event on July 7th the very
[3:12:32.120 --> 3:12:36.400]  next morning he said I don't want anything to do with this I I can't be
[3:12:36.400 --> 3:12:39.920]  with Kathy Griffin anymore that was directly because we're gonna hold
[3:12:39.920 --> 3:12:44.480]  protests we're gonna show up if they want to support ISIS and terrorism
[3:12:44.480 --> 3:12:50.080]  against our president and support this death-like cult then now we're gonna show
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:53.200]  up with the protest and they don't know how to react so they're running afraid
[3:12:53.200 --> 3:12:56.680]  I've got a few clips here of them the really juicy ones I played earlier did
[3:12:56.680 --> 3:13:00.160]  you see in her press conference with all reds daughter where she sits there and
[3:13:00.160 --> 3:13:04.920]  goes men write my paychecks I've been abused he needs to apologize it's like
[3:13:04.920 --> 3:13:08.720]  Hillary she won't and I want to bash women this is men do this too today but
[3:13:08.720 --> 3:13:13.800]  the culture says it's okay for women to do it's disgusting where they never take
[3:13:13.800 --> 3:13:18.280]  responsibility Hillary you lost because you're a crime family you're a pig if the
[3:13:18.280 --> 3:13:21.040]  Democrats would have run a woman that was actually caring about the people she
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:24.760]  would have beat Trump okay I vote for a woman in a minute if she's a patriot I
[3:13:24.760 --> 3:13:29.320]  supported LePen I support you know I mean she's not perfect but May is better
[3:13:29.320 --> 3:13:33.240]  than what we had over in the UK men don't care if it's women in charge as long
[3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:40.640]  as they're doing a good job yeah I'm sorry go ahead I was saying Tulsi
[3:13:40.640 --> 3:13:45.080]  Gabbard if she had won if the Democrats had run Tulsi Gabbard that would have
[3:13:45.080 --> 3:13:49.400]  been a very scary election for the Trump people so you're right I know very a lot
[3:13:49.400 --> 3:13:53.400]  of men who are hoping Tulsi Gabbard will run but then the Clintons are trying to
[3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:57.360]  keep her exactly it's a no-brainer when I look at a candidate I care about the
[3:13:57.360 --> 3:14:00.680]  track record what they do I don't look are they brown are they black are they a
[3:14:00.680 --> 3:14:04.200]  man are they a woman I look are they for freedom and I'm so sick of the left
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:08.040]  claiming we're obsessed with what color somebody is or what's between their legs
[3:14:08.040 --> 3:14:11.760]  I care about action but but but getting back to the media there is this thing
[3:14:11.760 --> 3:14:15.600]  where women are supposedly allowed to call for violence whoever they want and
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:18.360]  then get away with it so they want the feminist deal where they can run around
[3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:21.720]  to be violent but then have the chivalry where we don't then say you're in a man's
[3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:27.520]  world no Hillary is now on this this this new tour of blaming everybody but
[3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:31.800]  herself what do you make of that yeah and that's been a problem for a long time
[3:14:31.800 --> 3:14:36.280]  they call them cry bullies Ben Garrison actually did a really hilarious cartoon of
[3:14:36.280 --> 3:14:40.640]  it where they'll come out and attack you and then when you defend yourself they
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:43.960]  cry oh my god I can't believe what we're being attacked or being attacked so
[3:14:43.960 --> 3:14:49.560]  Kathy Griffin created an ISIS terrorist message that was a call to violence
[3:14:49.560 --> 3:14:53.080]  that was a direct call of violence to all the people in ISIS who support
[3:14:53.080 --> 3:14:58.680]  Hollywood and then when we fight back and get her fired from CNN her shows have
[3:14:58.680 --> 3:15:03.480]  been canceled she's been kicked out of many venues her career is and we're
[3:15:03.480 --> 3:15:07.680]  still fighting after what she did today I talked to a bunch of my people and I
[3:15:07.680 --> 3:15:11.680]  go okay you know I think I think if Kathy Griffin issues an apology video to
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:16.920]  Baron then we'll back off but when she came on to video today and said she's
[3:15:16.920 --> 3:15:20.960]  gonna keep attacking Baron and that she thinks it's funny to attack 11 year old
[3:15:20.960 --> 3:15:24.800]  children I realized that could be my children or your children or anybody
[3:15:24.800 --> 3:15:28.620]  listening their children so we're actually gonna attack even more and we
[3:15:28.620 --> 3:15:31.760]  know what it is they're doing it to threaten and mess with the family and
[3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:35.640]  don't they get when you mess it shows how disconnected they are when you mess
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:39.400]  with people's kids dumbass the reason people don't do that is because they
[3:15:39.400 --> 3:15:43.640]  mean no truces ever happen after that the reason mafia's don't kill kids is
[3:15:43.640 --> 3:15:47.400]  because then they know the other side never gives up and never makes a deal
[3:15:47.400 --> 3:15:51.920]  dumbass doesn't she understand now she's made the president a personal enemy and
[3:15:51.920 --> 3:15:55.200]  she better watch her ass I wouldn't blame Trump if you did anything to her
[3:15:55.200 --> 3:16:00.440]  now well and she's made more important like Don Jr. is not letting up Don Jr.
[3:16:00.440 --> 3:16:04.440]  I've never seen him this fired up so in a way because I remember you and I we
[3:16:04.440 --> 3:16:09.320]  had this conversation and I said you know I'm glad for from our perspective
[3:16:09.320 --> 3:16:13.080]  that the media has gone after Trump as bad as they are and he said well why is
[3:16:13.080 --> 3:16:18.680]  that sort of it you know and I said well because now Trump realizes who has his
[3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:23.200]  back and it's the info warriors it's you me and some people you know Paul Joseph
[3:16:23.200 --> 3:16:26.640]  why it's not about us getting credit he goes more hardcore with our world view
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:30.320]  now he understood Trump was already a patriot he realizes they're not gonna
[3:16:30.320 --> 3:16:33.840]  compromise with me I'm gonna go hardcore with the real patriots he now is gonna
[3:16:33.840 --> 3:16:37.920]  be who he really is exactly that's why they pulled out of the Paris Accord is
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:41.880]  he realized well wait a minute every time I listen to globalist Gary or Dina
[3:16:41.880 --> 3:16:46.920]  hubby Powell or these Goldman Sachs people all I do is my own base I
[3:16:46.920 --> 3:16:50.960]  alienate and the liberals aren't gonna like me anyway that is what that's why
[3:16:50.960 --> 3:16:54.000]  Bannon's back at what I heard is Bannon's back in the catbird seat that's why
[3:16:54.000 --> 3:16:58.360]  they're flipping out is that true well we want to be very careful what we say
[3:16:58.360 --> 3:17:01.720]  about Bannon because if Bannon gets too much attention that can cause a little
[3:17:01.720 --> 3:17:07.160]  bit of drama but let's just say Bannon is laying low but the Patriots should be
[3:17:07.160 --> 3:17:10.520]  very happy knowing that good things are happening which is what you said three
[3:17:10.520 --> 3:17:13.720]  weeks ago on what my sources said the gloves are coming off and we just saw
[3:17:13.720 --> 3:17:19.040]  it exactly that was why Trump pulled out of the Paris Accord as he realized okay
[3:17:19.040 --> 3:17:23.280]  the media they're gonna go after my children they hate me anyway I might as
[3:17:23.280 --> 3:17:27.640]  well hate them back and I might as well do what the Patriots want me to do and
[3:17:27.640 --> 3:17:31.480]  fight for the people actually got them elected so it's a beautiful thing and
[3:17:31.480 --> 3:17:35.400]  going after Baron again the Kathy Griffin thing today was from my
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:40.800]  perspective I'm glad she did it because that shows the true face of modern
[3:17:40.800 --> 3:17:46.640]  liberalism they'll go after children they don't blame ISIS they love to be
[3:17:46.640 --> 3:17:50.920]  violent and they whine and bitch like they're victims in the middle of the
[3:17:50.920 --> 3:17:56.880]  display exactly and then half and then they're emotionally erratic so she she's
[3:17:56.880 --> 3:18:02.960]  one minute laughing one minute crying that's like a toddler that's what you
[3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:06.360]  know my six-month-old daughter will do is one minute she's giggling and then
[3:18:06.360 --> 3:18:10.800]  crying and then they're it's like a cry giggle you know your parent yes right
[3:18:10.800 --> 3:18:18.400]  that's Kathy Griffin a 56 year old infant man I'd say she's crazy look I've
[3:18:18.400 --> 3:18:20.880]  played a bunch of these clips but here's some of the other clips from the Kathy
[3:18:20.880 --> 3:18:23.680]  Griffin press conference
[3:18:24.440 --> 3:18:29.240]  no crap this wouldn't be happening to a guy this is a woman thing all right I'm
[3:18:29.240 --> 3:18:33.640]  just gonna come out and say it you don't agree with me but I live it I'm 56
[3:18:33.640 --> 3:18:37.600]  years old everywhere I play there's a male promoter there's a male alone to
[3:18:37.600 --> 3:18:42.520]  theater people assigned my checks are white guys they're usually what did you
[3:18:42.520 --> 3:18:46.400]  was saying that you were happy to deliver beat down the Donald Trump and also to
[3:18:46.400 --> 3:18:53.320]  Baron and that you quote wanted to go down hard on Donald and go direct for
[3:18:53.320 --> 3:18:59.800]  Baron so this is a quote yeah I said that my act yeah she said that so you
[3:18:59.800 --> 3:19:03.320]  admitted you're going after Baron Trump is that what this is all about I think
[3:19:03.320 --> 3:19:06.640]  I think a comic should be able to make fun of everybody like I apologize my
[3:19:06.640 --> 3:19:10.120]  questions for Lisa oh so are you aware that your client is trying to go after
[3:19:10.120 --> 3:19:13.680]  Baron okay so that's a ridiculous misleading question and no it just
[3:19:13.680 --> 3:19:16.560]  said a single word here today about Baron who's talking about something from a
[3:19:16.560 --> 3:19:19.680]  comedy act from years ago she's fine the part of it no it's last year it's six
[3:19:19.680 --> 3:19:24.400]  months ago let me talk about this issue of children okay we can have edgy
[3:19:24.400 --> 3:19:28.640]  comics in America comics can say things that are not appropriate for children
[3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:33.120]  comics can create images that are not appropriate for children many things on
[3:19:33.120 --> 3:19:38.000]  the news are not appropriate for children I'm a parent of two adult children
[3:19:38.000 --> 3:19:43.520]  and a teenage foster son it is my job as a parent to filter out what is
[3:19:43.520 --> 3:19:48.600]  appropriate for my children it is not the job of a comic to filter everything
[3:19:48.600 --> 3:19:51.960]  down to the left kids all their speech but nobody else does she gets to make
[3:19:51.960 --> 3:19:56.240]  the comedy and the art that she wants to make and the can we go back to the
[3:19:56.240 --> 3:19:59.600]  clip I played earlier today where she totally cries
[3:19:59.600 --> 3:20:04.120]  can block out Trump can block out every news organization tweeting out this
[3:20:04.120 --> 3:20:07.560]  photo you know what there's a lot of disgusting stuff about Trump on the news
[3:20:07.560 --> 3:20:11.160]  every day like the fact that he's making us the laughing stock of the world
[3:20:11.160 --> 3:20:14.600]  okay you know what there are other people here he's making us the laughing
[3:20:14.600 --> 3:20:18.600]  stock these are pathetic slugs going knowing the corporate media wants to
[3:20:18.600 --> 3:20:23.840]  destroy Trump throwing themselves on the altar of the system hoping the system
[3:20:23.840 --> 3:20:27.800]  gives them attention they don't get they came a dollar day you know a dollar
[3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:33.320]  short a day late I mean they're here just these two narcissistic you know
[3:20:33.320 --> 3:20:38.840]  bubble bees up there on TV just hoping for attention and all they're getting is
[3:20:38.840 --> 3:20:42.880]  their own destruction Mike oh and that's why I'm glad and that's again why I
[3:20:42.880 --> 3:20:47.960]  support free speech I'm glad they did that because I want the whole country to
[3:20:47.960 --> 3:20:54.000]  look at least they went back in five years ago and then I want that nasty
[3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:58.400]  attitude that terrible attitude to the typical Hillary Clinton supporter where
[3:20:58.400 --> 3:21:02.840]  they can't talk in a civilized manner they why are they so arrogant why are
[3:21:02.840 --> 3:21:08.040]  they because they are so arrogant because they've had their boot on the
[3:21:08.040 --> 3:21:13.680]  nets of America for 20 years you know what it's like you can we can't go out
[3:21:13.680 --> 3:21:17.000]  anywhere in public without security if you and I want to have a meet-up and
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:21.120]  just meet people and talk to people we have to have third-party security there
[3:21:21.120 --> 3:21:24.800]  because that is how the violent the left is and they thought that they had us beat
[3:21:24.800 --> 3:21:30.160]  down not realizing that made us realize this is a fight for our life for our
[3:21:30.160 --> 3:21:34.000]  children's lives and we're gonna fight that much harder now Trump realizes it
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:38.200]  too they literally want to murder him Kathy Griffin literally wants to murder
[3:21:38.200 --> 3:21:44.320]  Baron Trump that is modern liberalism today well they certainly demonizing and
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:47.360]  though I mean other public I don't know why they went for Kathy Griffin quite
[3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:50.800]  frankly she just has the bloody head and you know looks like ISIS have a thing
[3:21:50.800 --> 3:21:55.400]  what about all the other clips where I mean you've seen it where CNBC MSNBC
[3:21:55.400 --> 3:22:00.400]  hosts say please blow up as Trump towers ISIS and reporters LA times New York
[3:22:00.400 --> 3:22:03.760]  Times all say let's kill Trump you know I'm gonna murder Trump I mean they're
[3:22:03.760 --> 3:22:10.000]  organizing it yeah actually a counter terror terrorism specialist who there
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:15.080]  is Malcolm Nance he actually said that yeah I think let's have a contest on
[3:22:15.080 --> 3:22:18.800]  which Trump hotel will be the first terrorist attack thing haha isn't that
[3:22:18.800 --> 3:22:22.840]  funny terrorism innocent people die innocent people murdered that is what
[3:22:22.840 --> 3:22:28.280]  the media that's why the contest going on right now the real play isn't Kathy
[3:22:28.280 --> 3:22:33.640]  Griffin the real play is for people to get those t-shirts and get on camera and
[3:22:33.640 --> 3:22:40.280]  say MSNBC terrorism info wars.com is the truth the media are the terrorists the
[3:22:40.280 --> 3:22:45.000]  media is ISIS CNN is ISIS that's why people gotta grab those shirts which you
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:49.160]  know there's no real money in that those are discounted over you can make your
[3:22:49.160 --> 3:22:52.520]  own poster make your own design we have the MP3's in fact you had the idea a
[3:22:52.520 --> 3:22:55.080]  few days ago that night it happened I guess Tuesday night or whatever it was
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:22:58.680]  once you know to do the contest so I did it but I think beyond Kathy Griffin
[3:22:58.680 --> 3:23:02.200]  saying you know CNN terrorists I agree and I've already got new t-shirts coming
[3:23:02.200 --> 3:23:10.920]  out of new MP3's new JPEGs just saying MSM you know is terrorism or
[3:23:10.920 --> 3:23:16.720]  CNN fake news show the contest is fake news MSM is terrorism MSM is the enemy
[3:23:16.720 --> 3:23:21.400]  as Trump says MSM is the enemy of America so MSM is the enemy of America
[3:23:21.400 --> 3:23:25.800]  info wars.com thousand dollars get it on TV national TV get the audio out
[3:23:25.800 --> 3:23:30.040]  repeatedly 2500 I want to pay this money out folks but isn't about the money it's
[3:23:30.040 --> 3:23:34.440]  about the fun of the first part you know what I think I'm gonna say this right
[3:23:34.440 --> 3:23:36.640]  now just to make it it may have already happened because I got a limited crew
[3:23:36.640 --> 3:23:39.840]  checking the emails and stuff has because last time took three four days to do
[3:23:39.840 --> 3:23:44.320]  it has somebody done this yet on national TV sir which I haven't heard yet
[3:23:44.320 --> 3:23:48.480]  either and that that's good maybe the first person who does it as of right
[3:23:48.480 --> 3:23:55.320]  now 3 23 p.m. eastern standard time maybe double the prize for the first
[3:23:55.320 --> 3:24:01.160]  person no no no it's ten thousand dollars wow we're on the same page we
[3:24:01.160 --> 3:24:07.000]  must trigger the chain reaction the first person that that that gets MSM is
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  fake news enemy of America info wars.com out with audio it's ten thousand first
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:17.040]  person to do it just with one of these Kathy Griffin is a terrorist MSM is a

[3:24:21.240 --> 3:24:25.280]  the money it's about taking action getting off the bench and folks you can
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:28.880]  get on local news it'll end up being on national news and then that counts I
[3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:33.520]  paid out a bunch of those where you hit local news look how there's probably a
[3:24:33.520 --> 3:24:37.920]  billion views online the first you know reporter out there on a live feed doesn't
[3:24:37.920 --> 3:24:41.120]  know he's live he says I don't care if she's 20 you know I such and such right
[3:24:41.120 --> 3:24:43.800]  and her such and such now that's crude you don't like it whatever I wouldn't do
[3:24:43.800 --> 3:24:48.120]  it he got fired though didn't know he's live so a local comedian got mad did it
[3:24:48.120 --> 3:24:52.560]  twice on live TV now it's having all the world billions of views for something
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:57.720]  that's funny but it doesn't do anything to say I'd you know what yeah I was a
[3:24:57.720 --> 3:25:00.880]  flood here today and I was worried about it and saw the wreckage flying by that's
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:05.480]  why you write them we don't that doesn't matter saying Bill Clinton's a rapist
[3:25:05.480 --> 3:25:10.880]  saying Trump's a hero fake news is the enemy of America Kathy Griffin you know

[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:20.560]  and it's a chain reaction it's about getting the public to realize the power
[3:25:20.560 --> 3:25:26.560]  you have to take action Mike Sernovich no exactly right and it's a show of
[3:25:26.560 --> 3:25:32.080]  force ultimately what we have we we have that's it's a show of force right we

[3:26:28.120 --> 3:26:31.800]  is going oh my god you know here's what they talked about today these terrible
[3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:35.440]  people even though we really aren't you see where Maxine Waters went this is
[3:26:35.440 --> 3:26:39.400]  done it in quote she said it's horrible they go they have American flags they're
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:44.280]  happy they're cheering we can't allow this this is extreme this is bad and the
[3:26:44.280 --> 3:26:47.840]  reporter goes it's bad to have American flags and be happy she goes yes I mean
[3:26:47.840 --> 3:26:52.080]  you talk about a loon bat man she doesn't want us have American flags and be
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:57.840]  happy well we focus on a protest that you never see an American flag and
[3:26:57.840 --> 3:27:02.160]  Democrat event you never see they burn up unless they're burning with Merkel
[3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:05.280]  where somebody had a German flag and she grabbed it like it was dirty yeah she
[3:27:05.280 --> 3:27:08.960]  that was the best video ever yeah so she somebody tried to bring it to watch
[3:27:08.960 --> 3:27:12.760]  tweets if you want to find it guys go ahead sorry yeah she grabbed it and
[3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:17.200]  threw it away and said no no you can't do this we're globalists oh and speaking
[3:27:17.200 --> 3:27:22.000]  of which did you see where the EU president tried to tell Trump that he
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:25.240]  couldn't leave the Paris Agreement a couple days before he did and they're
[3:27:25.240 --> 3:27:30.920]  so snide and he goes I tried to explain to Trump and clear German sentences that
[3:27:30.920 --> 3:27:35.000]  you can't just leave the agreement and I thought man these people are disgusting
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:38.560]  I feel really bad for our international listeners yeah that's the one for the
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:44.320]  unelected dictator of the EU threatening our president it's like who could
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:49.640]  who could make up like everybody says Nazi this Nazi that Yunker is literally
[3:27:49.640 --> 3:27:55.440]  the heir to the Nazi stolen fortune of Luxembourg I mean out of a movie so we
[3:27:55.440 --> 3:27:58.960]  got Trump hugging the American flag we have Merkel sees in a German flag and
[3:27:58.960 --> 3:28:04.520]  grabs it and drags it away yeah they hate America and speaking of which this
[3:28:04.520 --> 3:28:09.920]  is a little bit related to is there on that Turkish basketball player his dad
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:15.640]  was just arrested by Turkish thugs and Turkey and if you think about it there's
[3:28:15.640 --> 3:28:21.120]  no freedom in Turkey but the globalist wanted us to us the Americans to go to
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:26.320]  war with Russia to defend NATO ally Turkey I mean can you believe it that
[3:28:26.320 --> 3:28:30.880]  that worse yeah exactly father Turkish started tamed the investigation and the
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:34.840]  globalists are telling us that in America we have a treaty obligation to
[3:28:34.840 --> 3:28:39.080]  defend Turkey if Russia ever goes into Turkey and you think what who are these
[3:28:39.080 --> 3:28:44.520]  sick people well my turn to which I want you to take over after this break if

[3:30:26.320 --> 3:30:30.120]  watched a dangerous little man give a very very scary speech Michael Moore

[3:30:35.200 --> 3:30:39.880]  never in US history been such a destructive and megalomaniac in the

[3:33:29.440 --> 3:33:38.040]  sports out for more Alex Jones on Twitter.com forward slash C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H
[3:33:38.040 --> 3:33:43.560]  Twitter forward slash Cernovich today we're gonna cover a story that the MSM
[3:33:43.560 --> 3:33:48.640]  does not want you to hear about they do not want you to know about the stories
[3:33:48.640 --> 3:33:54.400]  about the A1 brothers they had higher-level security than Seth Rich had
[3:33:54.400 --> 3:34:00.280]  actually they were the IT directors for the Democrats for Debra Wasserman
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:05.680]  Schultz and for the entire Democrat Congress in that capacity they had access
[3:34:05.680 --> 3:34:12.120]  to all of the emails sent to and from Congress this should be a headline
[3:34:12.120 --> 3:34:16.880]  story we always talk about collusion we always talk about foreign influence in
[3:34:16.880 --> 3:34:20.560]  the fake news media they're always talking about what are these foreign
[3:34:20.560 --> 3:34:25.520]  governments trying to do well there are actually two people with the highest
[3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:31.840]  level privileges and access to every email they were the A1 brothers major
[3:34:31.840 --> 3:34:37.240]  national security threat major major terrorist threat they had connections to
[3:34:37.240 --> 3:34:42.360]  terrorist organizations the Democrats are trying to obstruct justice and trying
[3:34:42.360 --> 3:34:47.080]  to shut it down so we are brought on a special guest today George Webb who has
[3:34:47.080 --> 3:34:52.920]  been following the story very closely so George I'll just say hello to you and
[3:34:52.920 --> 3:34:57.120]  then let you kind of talk about the A1 brother story and tell us what you've
[3:34:57.120 --> 3:35:03.720]  been finding sure well it's it's like Whitmore to Bernstein now with the so I'm
[3:35:03.720 --> 3:35:09.240]  George Webb and this is Jason Goodman of ground source the truth so you got
[3:35:09.240 --> 3:35:15.560]  both of us two for one like great so the A1 brothers is a simple story it's
[3:35:15.560 --> 3:35:22.040]  basically Demi Wasserman and Schultz running a spy ring in Congress now the
[3:35:22.040 --> 3:35:26.520]  interesting reporting that we do with going out on the internet is we get
[3:35:26.520 --> 3:35:31.320]  people to search with us and for us and then I am kind of a stenographer and
[3:35:31.320 --> 3:35:36.960]  push it back the intelligence out to people for more detailed searches we
[3:35:36.960 --> 3:35:40.040]  just kind of go down in the level you know we started 30,000 feet we bring it
[3:35:40.040 --> 3:35:45.520]  in for a landing on every topic crowd source the truth is a discussion area
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:49.800]  where we discuss those and we weigh that kind of like weighing the evidence
[3:35:49.800 --> 3:35:55.000]  sort of thing so everything we take in we go through a vetting process and on
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:35:59.280]  crowd source the truth and I'm out there basically collecting Jason's running
[3:35:59.280 --> 3:36:05.440]  the New York studio here in Chelsea and the things that we found beyond these
[3:36:05.440 --> 3:36:10.760]  daily callers story Luke Rosiak's done great reporting on on these four well
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:18.240]  there's gonna be six in total awans if you count wives let me let me interrupt
[3:36:18.240 --> 3:36:22.680]  you for a second my good friend when you say Debra Wasserman we
[3:36:22.680 --> 3:36:26.840]  need to take a big step back when you say Debra Wasserman Schultz was running a
[3:36:26.840 --> 3:36:32.200]  spy ring in Congress that is not the kind of thing we just say and move on
[3:36:32.200 --> 3:36:38.720]  that is a nuclear direct truth bomb if it is true so let's go back to the what
[3:36:38.720 --> 3:36:42.600]  you initially said you claimed that Debra Wasserman Schultz was running a
[3:36:42.600 --> 3:36:47.920]  spy ring Congress so what evidence do we have to support that well our best
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:52.480]  evidence comes from James Comey himself saying that the mechanism that that how
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:57.920]  it's done is with a blackberry sinking to a laptop and this is how humor got her
[3:36:57.920 --> 3:37:03.720]  emails to Anthony Weeders laptop so all they did is just reproduce that for let's
[3:37:03.720 --> 3:37:08.520]  see about 80 to 150 members of Congress and we don't really know how many now
[3:37:08.520 --> 3:37:13.840]  the other part of this that people are gonna find maybe either funny or
[3:37:13.840 --> 3:37:20.320]  surprising is Anthony Weeder played that role with the Iwan brothers before
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:24.520]  Debbie Wasserman took over that role and everyone thinks of Anthony Weeder as kind
[3:37:24.520 --> 3:37:28.720]  of this guy with a problem but he's actually running that spy ring before
[3:37:28.720 --> 3:37:34.840]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz well I believe that to be true but what evidence do we
[3:37:34.840 --> 3:37:38.480]  have I guess would be my claim so there's a lot of people keep in mind when
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:44.520]  we say the Iwan brothers as you know if Trump tweets a typo on Twitter that is
[3:37:44.520 --> 3:37:48.000]  on every cable news station in the world but there are a lot of people watching
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:51.680]  and listening are saying wait a minute I've never heard of the Iwan brothers
[3:37:51.680 --> 3:37:57.880]  what is that even about okay so these there are six people that are employed
[3:37:57.880 --> 3:38:01.360]  in the Congress all making a hundred and sixty thousand dollars or in that
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:04.800]  neighborhood which is right at the top end of Congress you could go to inside
[3:38:04.800 --> 3:38:08.920]  Gov right now and look up search for the name of one and you'll see the six
[3:38:08.920 --> 3:38:14.840]  names now two of them are wives so that it's you know all the ALVI or you can
[3:38:14.840 --> 3:38:21.040]  look up Natalia Sova SOVA okay now the two pundit has reported the burglaries
[3:38:21.040 --> 3:38:26.440]  that the Iwan brothers did the 20 different burglaries they did and New
[3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:30.560]  York Post is also reported on this as well as I mentioned Wayne Rosiak
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:37.760]  the caller Marita Bartoloma at Fox had this Barney had it let's see couple of
[3:38:37.760 --> 3:38:43.400]  the jobs I think had it what we've done is basically gone forward from there with
[3:38:43.400 --> 3:38:48.000]  in-depth searches and found out different companies they've worked for in
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:51.120]  Congress I've developed sources in the Congress I know you're at White House
[3:38:51.120 --> 3:38:56.680]  Correspondents now mics of congratulations on that and so I have a
[3:38:56.680 --> 3:39:01.360]  I'm not going to say a mole in Congress but I've been given a lot of
[3:39:01.360 --> 3:39:05.960]  information that Imron worked for a company called Inter-American the CIA
[3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:11.640]  wink there is Enter America but I'll cover that later with my audience but
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:17.800]  basically through visas and passports getting these foreign nationals into
[3:39:17.800 --> 3:39:21.880]  Congress in a kind of a quasi congressional role and then moving them
[3:39:21.880 --> 3:39:26.600]  into being house staffers and these are guys nobody ever sees in Congress I was
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:33.040]  all on Capitol Hill about last Jason and I were there at least seven days
[3:39:33.040 --> 3:39:37.400]  talking to everybody Jason had an ambush interview with Debbie Wasserman
[3:39:37.400 --> 3:39:41.400]  Schultz she didn't know who the Iwan brothers was apparently not she didn't
[3:39:41.400 --> 3:39:44.520]  have much to say about it you know the other thing that Mike you're asking
[3:39:44.520 --> 3:39:49.120]  about evidence I think certainly Debbie Wasserman Schultz's own behavior is an
[3:39:49.120 --> 3:39:52.720]  indicator that this is a serious issue we saw in the news in her own words
[3:39:52.720 --> 3:39:57.720]  there's video of her threatening the chief of the Capitol Police to return
[3:39:57.720 --> 3:40:02.400]  what is evidence in a criminal investigation of multiple laptops that
[3:40:02.400 --> 3:40:06.520]  were stolen from various congressional offices and blackberries and by
[3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:12.240]  now I believe that if people haven't seen the video Debbie Wasserman Schultz
[3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:17.880]  there it is threatening the there's a virtuoso who's the Capitol Police down
[3:40:17.880 --> 3:40:22.000]  there on D Street she goes right into it she threatens his budget three times
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:27.160]  because she sits on the committee that funds his budget and then you have her
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:31.320]  at the end saying there will be consequences but if that wasn't enough
[3:40:31.320 --> 3:40:38.160]  she just had the Chief Administrative Officer come the three guys that gave
[3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:42.200]  the Iwans their top secret clearance or their clearances and gave them their
[3:40:42.200 --> 3:40:48.120]  IT credentials and you can watch that video of her blaming them now she's the
[3:40:48.120 --> 3:40:54.480]  person who gave Imran Iwan her laptop and her password and these it wouldn't
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:40:58.440]  this isn't just email going back and forth these are people that sit on some
[3:40:58.440 --> 3:41:02.280]  of the most sensitive committees in the Congress House Permanent Select Committee
[3:41:02.280 --> 3:41:09.440]  on Intelligence DHS and Foreign Affairs like Andre Carson Basterra I could
[3:41:09.440 --> 3:41:15.840]  Jackie Spear Swalwell we saw in the hall and had a small army around it we went
[3:41:15.840 --> 3:41:20.520]  to Devin Nunes office to try to promote this so we were trying to get you
[3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:23.440]  could just feel it you could feel it that this story was about ready to break
[3:41:23.440 --> 3:41:29.720]  yeah we I have mountains of evidence 700 videos out there to get people want to
[3:41:29.720 --> 3:41:33.880]  look at all the evidence yeah and those are on the George Webb YouTube channel
[3:41:33.880 --> 3:41:38.320]  which is essentially sort of like a raw intelligence feed every day it's kind of
[3:41:38.320 --> 3:41:41.880]  like what an editor would see coming back from a reporter coming back in from
[3:41:41.880 --> 3:41:46.680]  the field and then Jason kind of on crowdsource the truth we talk about the
[3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:51.560]  evidence for instance we got a thumb drive that may have been Seth Rich's
[3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:58.320]  thumb drive well we should I said May I used they capital letters in May but it
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:06.160]  was from Bernie people up in Boston but that worked with the NGP band software
[3:42:06.160 --> 3:42:11.400]  that Seth worked for we've talked to experts in Australia who say that yes
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:17.240]  very backups I could go look at Bernie data and Bernie could go look at my
[3:42:17.240 --> 3:42:23.000]  data they even accused Bernie of looking at their data in December of 2015 he
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:26.760]  confirmed that during the backup process and the process had control of all the
[3:42:26.760 --> 3:42:34.480]  files that this data was swipable I guess or hackable visible to all users and
[3:42:34.480 --> 3:42:38.640]  Seth Rich was pissed I mean that's the bottom line you know and just to
[3:42:38.640 --> 3:42:43.440]  clarify Mike this is not George making these claims DC capital police
[3:42:43.440 --> 3:42:48.360]  consider the Iwan brothers suspects and burglaries and hacking of the House of
[3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:52.720]  Representatives and we've spoken to experts we just earlier this week George
[3:42:52.720 --> 3:42:56.720]  and I went and did what I can really only categorize as sort of like an
[3:42:56.720 --> 3:43:02.400]  intelligence assessment with Dr. Corsi all about how this NGP band system works
[3:43:02.400 --> 3:43:07.440]  and what it is is it's a database that's essentially a continuous
[3:43:07.440 --> 3:43:12.840]  accumulation of data from the time it was installed up until today so when we
[3:43:12.840 --> 3:43:18.360]  say that the data dump that we just released last night on various Google
[3:43:18.360 --> 3:43:22.840]  Drive accounts that have already been taken down not by us but someone who has
[3:43:22.840 --> 3:43:28.560]  access to our Google Drive accounts you know that that NGP band system would
[3:43:28.560 --> 3:43:33.080]  contain data that would have been leaked by Seth Rich and additional data since
[3:43:33.080 --> 3:43:37.680]  then because it just keeps adding more and more data to it and what we do with
[3:43:37.680 --> 3:43:42.080]  crowdsourced the truth is we push George's raw intelligence out to the
[3:43:42.080 --> 3:43:46.240]  open-source community and we are already getting back so incredible
[3:43:46.240 --> 3:43:51.320]  assessments from IT people people with real experience doctors it has proven
[3:43:51.320 --> 3:43:57.920]  to be an incredibly powerful method in the in analyzing the intelligence for
[3:43:57.920 --> 3:44:03.680]  instance that Jason did with Rod Wheeler we had him for a photo shoot and
[3:44:03.680 --> 3:44:08.920]  and both of us interviewed him we went through an intelligence assessment of
[3:44:08.920 --> 3:44:12.720]  every piece of evidence and we really came up with only two pieces of evidence
[3:44:12.720 --> 3:44:18.520]  that are that we know for sure we push all the testimony of humans aside and
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:22.960]  we start with the metadata what are the two facts it's the same thing that Kim
[3:44:22.960 --> 3:44:29.120]  com tweeted about and he put part of the file name out there one is the FBI
[3:44:29.120 --> 3:44:35.040]  confiscated Seth Rich's phone the other one is he confiscated his laptop
[3:44:35.040 --> 3:44:40.000]  now the third bombshell that Rod dropped on us was there may be an FBI bullet
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:45.600]  and that would have gone into a secure evidence bag as well and the fourth
[3:44:45.600 --> 3:44:49.840]  thing that came from our law intelligent law enforcement community is
[3:44:49.840 --> 3:44:54.840]  there's no way that story with the gun getting the long gun out of the FBI car
[3:44:54.840 --> 3:44:58.240]  there's no way it can possibly be true because there's an electronic tumbler
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:45:02.720]  you have to hit a switch to enact the tumbler to get the long rifle out the
[3:45:02.720 --> 3:45:07.120]  gun is usually going to be on the hip of the FBI agent and then the secure phone
[3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:11.280]  all DC communications and Capitol Police communications are encrypted the
[3:45:11.280 --> 3:45:15.160]  encrypted phone is going to be in a secure lock box as well with the trip
[3:45:15.160 --> 3:45:19.720]  that you have to know how to press you have to know so this idea that somehow
[3:45:19.720 --> 3:45:26.960]  this you know somebody got into the FBI car and then and that's how they shot
[3:45:26.960 --> 3:45:33.680]  Seth Rich is really quite a stretch again metadata we focus on the metadata yeah
[3:45:33.680 --> 3:45:37.800]  the Seth Rich thing is definitely a different conversation for another day
[3:45:37.800 --> 3:45:41.880]  is okay I want to talk about yeah the A1 Brothers I think is a massive story
[3:45:41.880 --> 3:45:48.160]  because right now the fake news media is going into overdrive to get everybody
[3:45:48.160 --> 3:45:53.760]  to quit talking about it I'm going to read you a quote from the Newsweek right
[3:45:53.760 --> 3:45:58.960]  now so Newsweek just published an article the far-rights fake news story of
[3:45:58.960 --> 3:46:05.000]  the week was hijacked by the tragic death of Baranthan and Wisonette so
[3:46:05.000 --> 3:46:09.200]  they're trying to say in Newsweek another fake news outlets that the A1
[3:46:09.200 --> 3:46:16.320]  Brothers is not a real story and yet and yet in this very article they admit
[3:46:16.320 --> 3:46:21.200]  that the A1 Brothers stole data but what they're trying to say is here I'll
[3:46:21.200 --> 3:46:25.120]  read the paragraph among those who were the victims of the A1 Brothers data
[3:46:25.120 --> 3:46:30.920]  theft was Wasserman Schultz the former DC head there was as many as 80 members
[3:46:30.920 --> 3:46:35.040]  may have been caught may have been targets of the A1s were now the subjects
[3:46:35.040 --> 3:46:40.680]  of a criminal probe so what fascinates me about that paragraph is if Wasserman
[3:46:40.680 --> 3:46:45.520]  Schultz is a crime victim why did she tell the Capitol Police that she was
[3:46:45.520 --> 3:46:50.920]  going to fund them and get people fired if they investigated the crime so what
[3:46:50.920 --> 3:46:55.160]  would your reaction to be to the fake news narrative that Debra Wasserman
[3:46:55.160 --> 3:46:59.840]  Schultz was actually a victim of the A1 Brothers
[3:47:07.000 --> 3:47:12.080]  okay yeah so that's what's interesting we were just talking to George Webb and I
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:16.440]  believe John Goodman about the A1 Brothers so that's what I find
[3:47:16.440 --> 3:47:21.440]  fascinating is right now that's how you know that you're over the target right
[3:47:21.440 --> 3:47:26.040]  now in Newsweek they're literally trying to claim that the A1 Brothers story is a
[3:47:26.040 --> 3:47:30.600]  fake news story okay so you guys are back so react to that like Debbie Wasserman
[3:47:30.600 --> 3:47:35.320]  Schultz's own behavior is the real indicator right there why what how can
[3:47:35.320 --> 3:47:38.680]  someone threaten the police to give back evidence in his criminal investigations
[3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:44.000]  so my direct recording is I went to DC I knocked on the 12 homes associated with
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:50.360]  Imran Awan last home I went to was in Lorton, Virginia 9667 Hawkshead Drive I
[3:47:50.360 --> 3:47:58.400]  knocked on the door a marine answers the door I say you know Imran Awan he says
[3:47:58.400 --> 3:48:03.760]  no well he says yes but he didn't say his name Imran Awan he said his name was
[3:48:03.760 --> 3:48:09.400]  Alex I said is he the person who rented you the home yes he rented it through my
[3:48:09.400 --> 3:48:13.400]  wife Hina Alvi now both of them have fled to Pakistan according to news
[3:48:13.400 --> 3:48:16.920]  reports but then I said is there anything strange you notice in the house
[3:48:16.920 --> 3:48:22.280]  and he said yes there was a pile of blackberries and there was a four three
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:26.080]  or four laptops and I said well there's anything interesting about those
[3:48:26.080 --> 3:48:30.480]  laptops you know or is he just collect blackberries he goes yeah they had state
[3:48:30.480 --> 3:48:36.080]  markings they had markings US government asset tag markings and in
[3:48:36.080 --> 3:48:40.960]  later videos I showed what a congressional marking looks like and he
[3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:46.200]  said that he called the police he called the FBI the FBI came over and got the
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:52.480]  blackberries and came over and got the laptops now he's out of the Marines now
[3:48:52.480 --> 3:48:59.080]  but his wife still works names Andre once I it's again on my channel T H E G
[3:48:59.080 --> 3:49:05.720]  A or T yes they his wife's in the in the Navy so NCIS which is an
[3:49:05.720 --> 3:49:10.840]  investigative body of the Office of Naval Intelligence came over interviewed his wife
[3:49:10.840 --> 3:49:15.440]  because they were concerned that maybe she had stolen these blackberries these
[3:49:15.440 --> 3:49:22.560]  congressional blackberries and laptops okay so again not me Andre Taggart I was
[3:49:22.560 --> 3:49:26.640]  on in conversation all that night with Luke Rosie X so I have the text to prove
[3:49:26.640 --> 3:49:31.680]  it and so the third thing he said was it's been relegated to the Capitol
[3:49:31.680 --> 3:49:37.200]  Police and the Capitol Police have those laptops and have those blackberries now
[3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:41.520]  Debbie Washington Schultz keeps proving my case for me she keeps calling these
[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:47.040]  people on the carpet and blaming them for something she did and it's I almost
[3:49:47.040 --> 3:49:51.040]  want to go watch her because she's gonna prove it for me she's she's really the
[3:49:51.040 --> 3:49:53.000]  one who's giving all the evidence you know the other thing that's worth
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  mentioning Mike it's not Jason and George who are saying this stuff the one
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:01.760]  brother's own stepmother filed the police report in which she accused them of
[3:50:01.760 --> 3:50:06.240]  threatening her with kidnapping her relatives in Pakistan and they hacked
[3:50:06.240 --> 3:50:12.920]  her cell phone this is all coming from her not us so this is an anti-Pakistani
[3:50:12.920 --> 3:50:18.680]  thing or an anti-Muslim thing at all I have fought for Muslim civil rights in
[3:50:18.680 --> 3:50:23.200]  the past against Andrew McCabe the current director of the FBI if you look
[3:50:23.200 --> 3:50:27.640]  at the Portland Tristan Street bomber case so let's just put the anti-Muslim
[3:50:27.640 --> 3:50:31.640]  thing aside we had a Albanian Muslim come up to us on the street when we went
[3:50:31.640 --> 3:50:36.040]  over to report on David Petraeus speaking at the 92nd Street Y and he said I
[3:50:36.040 --> 3:50:41.120]  want to get my picture with you so all right well thanks guys for having you on

[3:54:11.560 --> 3:54:16.840]  c-e-r-n-o-v-i-c-h before we go into there I thought it'd be good to talk about
[3:54:16.840 --> 3:54:21.840]  how we pulled out of the Paris Accord and how that relates to sunscreen now a
[3:54:21.840 --> 3:54:24.800]  lot of you're gonna say well wait wait wait this doesn't make any sense I'll
[3:54:24.800 --> 3:54:30.320]  tell you why right now there's a very new powerful sunscreen by info
[3:54:30.320 --> 3:54:34.840]  wars that has zinc oxide well a lot of people don't realize especially younger
[3:54:34.840 --> 3:54:39.640]  people is that when I was a kid the the so-called scientists and experts said
[3:54:39.640 --> 3:54:43.440]  there's a hole in the ozone layer and you better put on sunscreen or else
[3:54:43.440 --> 3:54:48.360]  you're all gonna die of skin cancer well as it turns out that goop that crap
[3:54:48.360 --> 3:54:53.560]  that you smear all over and it looks gross I don't even know what it is like
[3:54:53.560 --> 3:54:59.000]  saliva or something like that that actually can accelerate and cause skin
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:04.240]  cancer the only skin care products I use for sunscreen they all contain zinc
[3:55:04.240 --> 3:55:09.600]  oxide because that reflects some of the harmful UV rays so we want every but
[3:55:09.600 --> 3:55:12.920]  that's what people got to understand is even though we cover the news even though
[3:55:12.920 --> 3:55:17.120]  we cover a lot of the threats to America we want you to be healthy wealthy
[3:55:17.120 --> 3:55:23.000]  wise we don't want you using products that are poisoned and full of toxins the
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:27.560]  the traditional kind of goop stuff so they make sure you go to info wars store
[3:55:27.560 --> 3:55:32.560]  dot com and get rid of these chemical products that you buy at the supermarket

[3:55:40.760 --> 3:55:44.360]  what I use as ink oxide stuff it really is the truth that I'm glad Alex finally
[3:55:44.360 --> 3:55:48.080]  has that because now I can buy my sunscreen from him rather than some you
[3:55:48.080 --> 3:55:52.480]  know corporation but the the final segment we just have a couple more
[3:55:52.480 --> 3:55:56.120]  minutes the a1 brother story is so important that there's we could talk
[3:55:56.120 --> 3:55:59.840]  about this for hours and hours and hours but there's a paragraph I wanted to read
[3:55:59.840 --> 3:56:07.360]  out of Newsweek so Newsweek is calling the a1 brothers fake news but even in
[3:56:07.360 --> 3:56:11.360]  their article criticizing us there's a line there they go wash them and chills
[3:56:11.360 --> 3:56:17.320]  for some reason retained a1 and an advisory capacity even after the
[3:56:17.320 --> 3:56:21.800]  Capitol Police investigation in the a1 family seemed to be ramping up whoa
[3:56:21.800 --> 3:56:26.440]  whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on a second if the a1 brother story is fake
[3:56:26.440 --> 3:56:30.240]  news and there's nothing to see here and Deborah Wasserman Schultz is just a
[3:56:30.240 --> 3:56:37.960]  poor helpless crime victim why was she paying money to criminal suspects why
[3:56:37.960 --> 3:56:43.440]  is she trying to shut down the investigation the fake news media the
[3:56:43.440 --> 3:56:47.040]  really run and stared here they don't want you to know this story so make
[3:56:47.040 --> 3:56:52.520]  sure when this video goes on the Alex Jones YouTube channel clip it snip it
[3:56:52.520 --> 3:56:57.320]  put it in your social media put it all over share these articles blast them out
[3:56:57.320 --> 3:57:02.040]  because they that's why they want to shut us down Newsweek is literally calling
[3:57:02.040 --> 3:57:07.360]  it fake news even though there's a criminal investigation and even though
[3:57:07.360 --> 3:57:13.560]  Wasserman Schultz paid criminals after they were being investigated for sharing
[3:57:13.560 --> 3:57:18.320]  top-secret emails to Islamic terrorist groups so we got a just 90 seconds
[3:57:18.320 --> 3:57:22.800]  George Webb Jason Goodman what is your final parting shot to the truth warriors
[3:57:22.800 --> 3:57:27.680]  at home who really want to know what is going on well really it's leveraging
