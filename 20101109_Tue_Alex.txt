[00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:10.263]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:11.863]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.863 --> 00:00:13.404]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:17.605]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:24.968]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.968 --> 00:00:27.589]  Very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.149]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.730]  It is Tuesday, the ninth day of November, 2010.
[00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:50.918]  We have an amazing individual joining us in studio in the third hour, Dr. Paul Conant, Director of the Fluoride Action Network, and we're talking about his new book, The Case Against Fluoride, coming up in the third hour today.
[00:00:50.918 --> 00:01:02.726]  This is another issue that we can take action against and have fluoride, sodium fluoride, removed from our water systems that are in about 70% of the country's water supplies, municipal water systems.
[00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:09.860]  Europe is also trying to force these systems into place, but a lot of people are bucking against it.
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:28.150]  So it's one of the issues where we can have an effect, but even if we can't get it out of our local water supply, we can educate people about how deadly it is with medical doctors, so it's on record, so people can take their own steps when you drink fluoridated water, or when you brush your teeth with fluoridated water, or when you bathe in it, which is just as bad as drinking it.
[00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:37.955]  They've also reported that the Large Hadron Collider has created the mini Big Bang with lead ions.
[00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:40.477]  That's big scientific development.
[00:01:40.477 --> 00:01:44.200]  We'll be covering that as well.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.105]  You know, if you go back and listen to my radio show 15 years ago, I was yelling and screaming about half the time.
[00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:53.586]  Now it's only maybe 5% of the time out of 100.
[00:01:56.271 --> 00:02:00.333]  95% of the time I'm somewhat calm, but I really want to be centered.
[00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:08.315]  Because when I am centered, when I'm not on air, when I'm just researching, I'm so much more articulate than when I just spin out of control with anger about what's happening.
[00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:09.176]  But this affects me.
[00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:09.776]  It affects you.
[00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:11.136]  It affects all of us.
[00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:14.497]  And some anger is good, but I'm here to impart information.
[00:02:14.497 --> 00:02:15.678]  Nobody complained yesterday.
[00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:19.999]  In fact, we had record listenership on the internet.
[00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.340]  Record.
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.101]  But even if some people like that and like seeing the train wreck,
[00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:34.733]  And in four hours of broadcast, I was calm most of the time, but I did rant and rave for probably 30 minutes overall, and I'm gonna try to not do that today.
[00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:50.863]  I'm gonna try to be centered, and when we come back from break, I am going to cover the unbelievable economic news, the huge developments with the naked body scanners and the TSA takeover of the homeland, not just the airports,
[00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:55.937]  We're going to get into a stack of bizarre news like this Reuters headline.
[00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:57.717]  Look out, your medicine is washing you.
[00:02:57.717 --> 00:02:59.418]  Microchips in the medicine.
[00:02:59.418 --> 00:03:00.738]  We talked about this years ago.
[00:03:00.738 --> 00:03:01.939]  That's where they were going with it.
[00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.359]  Now it's here.
[00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.680]  Gold has gone way past $1,400.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.440]  Last time I checked, it was $1,418+.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.841]  I'll check during the break exactly where it's at.
[00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:19.289]  On the naked body scanning front though, this is now a big national story.
[00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.691]  You did it, I did it, we did it together with the help of the Drudge Report.
[00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:40.281]  There are now hundreds of news articles today, hundreds yesterday, many of them sourcing back to our articles at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with people really facing
[00:03:41.647 --> 00:03:51.830]  How abusive this is, how humiliating this is, and how it doesn't protect us from the supposed turban-wearing boogeymen.
[00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.912]  And it shows, just like the system demonized the Tea Party but it came to political power.
[00:03:57.912 --> 00:03:59.733]  Now we'll see if it gets co-opted.
[00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:02.114]  The point is the system tried to demonize it and it didn't work.
[00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:06.550]  And we're having victories on the bisphenol A and the plastics front.
[00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.752]  We're having victories on the sodium fluoride front.
[00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:13.135]  We're having victories on the Gardasil and H1N1 shot front.
[00:04:13.135 --> 00:04:16.898]  Record low numbers of people are now taking it.
[00:04:16.898 --> 00:04:22.521]  The more the system hypes and pushes something, the more people turn against it.
[00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:27.185]  And so something very special is happening right now with the naked body scanners and
[00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.052]  It's good to be empowered.
[00:04:30.052 --> 00:04:34.239]  It's good to see that we can have an effect if we take action.
[00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:35.300]  It's very buoying.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.588]  So I shouldn't get angry and feel powerless and yell and scream because that's really why I do that.
[00:04:40.588 --> 00:04:43.172]  I just become enraged with frustration.
[00:04:44.073 --> 00:04:44.794]  I don't think so.
[00:05:00.296 --> 00:05:04.761]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:11.168]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:11.168 --> 00:05:15.073]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:18.556]  How much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:23.420]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:32.108]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:35.832]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:43.118]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:43.118 --> 00:05:47.002]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:53.388]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:05:53.388 --> 00:05:54.169]  Thank you.
[00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:16.657]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:06:16.657 --> 00:06:20.339]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:34.120]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:41.387]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:52.441]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:06:52.441 --> 00:06:56.366]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:59.490]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:04.613]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.613 --> 00:07:05.533]  Number 1.
[00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:08.954]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.954 --> 00:07:09.814]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.814 --> 00:07:14.696]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.696 --> 00:07:15.456]  It's true.
[00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:20.318]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.318 --> 00:07:21.138]  Number 3.
[00:07:21.138 --> 00:07:24.740]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.421]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:29.441]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:32.182]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.182 --> 00:07:35.882]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.882 --> 00:07:36.662]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:40.803]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.803 --> 00:07:45.864]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:50.045]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.045 --> 00:07:51.825]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:56.426]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:07:56.766 --> 00:08:06.083]  877-327-0365 Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.083 --> 00:08:08.387]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:20.902]  Well, it's the kickoff of another live transmission.
[00:08:20.902 --> 00:08:25.267]  Radio, satellite, television at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:25.267 --> 00:08:26.228]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:26.228 --> 00:08:29.571]  We are 8 minutes, 25 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:31.654]  It is Tuesday, the 9th day of November, 2010.
[00:08:33.925 --> 00:08:37.986]  And we do have Dr. Paul Conant joining us in studio in the last hour.
[00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:45.447]  Dr. Paul Conant is the director of the Fluoride Action Network and the executive director of its parent body, the American Environmental Health Studies Project.
[00:08:45.447 --> 00:08:47.727]  He has testified before Congress.
[00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:55.789]  He holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Cambridge and a PhD from chemistry at Dartmouth College and is a retired professor of environmental chemistry and toxicology at St.
[00:08:55.789 --> 00:08:57.309]  Lawrence University.
[00:08:57.309 --> 00:09:00.049]  He will be joining us in studio today.
[00:09:00.049 --> 00:09:01.670]  And he's co-written this book
[00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.671]  Paul Conant, Ph.D.
[00:09:04.671 --> 00:09:07.793]  with James Beck, M.D., medical doctor and Ph.D.
[00:09:07.793 --> 00:09:09.615]  and H.S.
[00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:10.115]  MacCalm.
[00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:21.814]  So that is a very interesting book, very informative, very important information, a new look at the scientific evidence, the case against fluoride.
[00:09:21.814 --> 00:09:26.316]  He will be joining us in studio here today.
[00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.878]  Gold has hit another all-time high of $1,420.20.
[00:09:28.878 --> 00:09:30.058]  That was just seconds ago, $1,420.20.
[00:09:39.623 --> 00:09:41.185]  Uh, right now.
[00:09:41.185 --> 00:09:44.829]  So, that is extremely, uh, important news there.
[00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:58.846]  We knew this was going to happen, because the laws of finance and economics show that when the government announces that the world reserve currency, the dollar, will be massively devalued, gold isn't going up, the dollar is going down.
[00:10:00.427 --> 00:10:03.729]  So we're going to be going over all of that today.
[00:10:03.729 --> 00:10:06.792]  Fed global backlash grows.
[00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:12.616]  It's funny, I called Paul Watson this morning and I said, I want you to write an article about global backlash against the Fed.
[00:10:12.616 --> 00:10:18.780]  And I said, you know, like world awakens to banker takeover, backlash accelerates.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.543]  And then I get here to the office and they've printed an article off Wall Street Journal
[00:10:23.303 --> 00:10:24.084]  Because that's what it is.
[00:10:24.084 --> 00:10:25.625]  It's a global backlash.
[00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.266]  Fed global backlash grows.
[00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:30.669]  China and Russia join Germany in scolding Obama.
[00:10:30.669 --> 00:10:33.091]  Defends move as pro-growth.
[00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:40.477]  We've got the German finance minister, we've got Ron Paul, saying the dollar is going to die and it's going to be a major global depression.
[00:10:40.477 --> 00:10:42.358]  Well, that's the plan.
[00:10:42.358 --> 00:10:46.662]  All these other finance ministers, all these other economists, I mean there's almost no one saying this is good.
[00:10:47.222 --> 00:10:54.990]  For the first time in modern history, in 97 years of the banking dictatorship, they had one of the Fed governors of Kansas City.
[00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.074]  He came out and said, this is going to destroy us.
[00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.036]  So, this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:03.392]  And I know you know that.
[00:11:03.392 --> 00:11:04.893]  It's why you listen to this broadcast.
[00:11:04.893 --> 00:11:07.053]  But I say this every day.
[00:11:07.053 --> 00:11:14.895]  It's one thing to intellectually know this and know what hyperinflation and dollar devaluation is going to do and to know it's a globalist plan in stone.
[00:11:14.895 --> 00:11:18.335]  That's how we could predict it over a decade ago because we didn't predict it.
[00:11:18.335 --> 00:11:21.176]  They told us what they would do.
[00:11:21.176 --> 00:11:26.537]  People marvel at Ron Paul being accurate or Bob Chapman or myself or so many others marvel
[00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:34.843]  I mean, if you jump off a 1,000 foot cliff with no parachute, you're gonna die.
[00:11:34.843 --> 00:11:38.126]  You're gonna die.
[00:11:38.126 --> 00:11:44.110]  You do what Argentina and many other nations have done in Weimar Republic Germany in the 1930s, I mean, you know what's gonna happen.
[00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.413]  I mean, this is not brain surgery, it's not rocket science, okay?
[00:11:48.413 --> 00:11:52.516]  It's not quantum mechanics, it's not nuclear physics, okay?
[00:11:55.077 --> 00:12:03.281]  I said at the first little segment that some stations don't care, the first five minutes today, that I'm going to try to remain centered throughout the entire broadcast.
[00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:15.207]  I've gotten better at this over the years, and I want to apologize to listeners for ranting and screaming and yelling yesterday, even though we had record listenership on the internet, which is one gauge we have.
[00:12:15.207 --> 00:12:18.789]  I want to apologize because I didn't probably cover one-tenth of the news I had in front of me.
[00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:33.644]  And the problem is, the reason I always get into one article on the stack and then run on for an hour about it is because I want to go through all the facets of each report we cover so people can see it in context of how it connects to this overall system.
[00:12:33.644 --> 00:12:46.071]  But I want to go through just a stack of bizarre news first, then the latest naked body scanner information, which isn't just about the scanners or humiliation, it's about the fight against it.
[00:12:48.294 --> 00:12:55.376]  It's about the awakening to just how much tyranny we're under.
[00:12:55.376 --> 00:13:06.200]  I mean, it's happened incrementally, but we're now reaching a flashpoint where folks are really starting to realize how dire these straits are.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:13.022]  And so without further ado, let me go ahead and just get into this little stack.
[00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:20.864]  of in-your-face bizarre news.
[00:13:20.864 --> 00:13:22.084]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:13:22.084 --> 00:13:25.786]  Look out, your medicine is watching you.
[00:13:25.786 --> 00:13:44.476]  And I remember over a decade ago seeing the patents for this, where even aspirin, Tylenol, will have chips in it, and they claim this is to track people that are abusing any type of vote-of-the-counter or prescription drug, and sets the precedent for your body to be basically filled with electronic microchips, Norvitis,
[00:13:45.396 --> 00:13:45.836]  I think?
[00:14:04.056 --> 00:14:07.277]  With the smartphones tracking everything you do by law.
[00:14:07.277 --> 00:14:11.397]  It's law that those spying systems are built into all the phones.
[00:14:11.397 --> 00:14:19.839]  It ties into the smart houses, the smart meters, where the government wants to control your thermostat and all the new appliances by law.
[00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:21.639]  What is it, by 2014 or is it 2015?
[00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:23.940]  You can pull it up.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.901]  And it's already rolling out that your dishwasher, your clothes washer, your
[00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:41.167]  Your refrigerator, your thermostat, everything has chips in them where the government doesn't need to have a wireless box on the pole and then they control your thermostat from that.
[00:14:41.167 --> 00:14:44.148]  That's the old technology they're already putting in place.
[00:14:44.148 --> 00:14:54.754]  This is data transferred down power lines and they can transfer data and it goes into the chip and then monitors everything going on in that appliance.
[00:14:54.754 --> 00:14:56.995]  This isn't coming, this is here.
[00:14:58.058 --> 00:15:02.861]  So, all products will have RFID chips tracking everywhere you go and what you do.
[00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:03.962]  There's been a big backlash.
[00:15:03.962 --> 00:15:06.564]  They plan to have this in place in 2004.
[00:15:06.564 --> 00:15:10.507]  The Pentagon's on record running the program.
[00:15:10.507 --> 00:15:18.712]  And they describe it as a total surveillance grid where everything going on in the third dimension, that's the dimension we live in.
[00:15:18.712 --> 00:15:25.998]  Cyberspace is its own dimension, its own artificial dimension within cyberspace, within the silicon.
[00:15:27.762 --> 00:15:30.624]  The Silicon.
[00:15:30.624 --> 00:15:43.415]  But this is described by MIT and the Pentagon as smart dust, and everything will have chips embedded in it, and so they can track the real world with the NSA Google-type software.
[00:15:43.415 --> 00:15:44.456]  And that's what Google is.
[00:15:44.456 --> 00:15:48.620]  It's NSA software given to the front company through In-Q-Tel and the CIA.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.901]  We told you that seven years ago.
[00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:53.244]  It was declassified last year that they are a complete government operation.
[00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.231]  Yeah, don't be evil, Google.
[00:15:56.231 --> 00:15:58.072]  See, I said I'd just cover all the news here.
[00:15:58.072 --> 00:16:00.354]  I've probably got 200 articles, literally.
[00:16:00.354 --> 00:16:01.334]  I mean, 200 or more.
[00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:06.478]  In fact, give me a document cam shot, just of the wide shot of all this news just today.
[00:16:06.478 --> 00:16:09.120]  For people to understand the frustration.
[00:16:11.148 --> 00:16:13.750]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.672]  So, that's what you need to know about that one article.
[00:16:16.672 --> 00:16:19.914]  Okay, here is another one.
[00:16:19.914 --> 00:16:34.605]  No soup for you, Michael Bloomberg targets salt sellers, Mayor Bloomberg's latest health campaign, cutting salt intake and he's using taxpayer money to run ads and billboards and radio and TV ads, saying how evil salt is.
[00:16:34.605 --> 00:16:39.208]  The truth is a lot of studies actually show that if you exercise and drink a lot of water, you actually need salt.
[00:16:42.056 --> 00:16:50.560]  You know, people have asked me in Texas, who are from up north, they say, why when you go to a 7-Eleven or any other convenience store, do you see big piles of little salt packets?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:17:01.626]  And why will you see the migrant workers in there after a hard day's work, just soaked in sweat, dumping packets of flavored salt into water or into beer?
[00:17:01.626 --> 00:17:02.847]  Well, it's because they need it.
[00:17:02.847 --> 00:17:10.110]  If you ever go work on a golf course all day, like I've done back in college, you will literally want to eat salt.
[00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:13.203]  That's
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.020]  Light bulbs you can have.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:31.981]  What type of refrigerator?
[00:17:31.981 --> 00:17:32.841]  What type of appliance?
[00:17:32.841 --> 00:17:34.322]  What type of cell phone?
[00:17:34.322 --> 00:17:35.883]  And now it's what type of food?
[00:17:35.883 --> 00:17:39.585]  And this is the global model to then monitor everything you do.
[00:17:39.585 --> 00:17:40.805]  They socialize healthcare.
[00:17:40.805 --> 00:17:48.369]  Then they say, well, your unhealthy lifestyle is costing me money in the socialist, collectivist system, so we have a right to tell you what you can and can't do.
[00:17:49.721 --> 00:17:52.544]  And you got the CPS taking people's children who are obese.
[00:17:52.544 --> 00:18:06.836]  But notice, there's no discussion about bisphenol A in most plastic products, admittedly in the major studies, causing all sorts of endocrine hormone problems in youth, and causing them to become obese.
[00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.418]  Or to give them cancer.
[00:18:08.418 --> 00:18:14.904]  Or to cause delayed fertility, puberty in males, and accelerated fertility in girls.
[00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:18.920]  And every time I talk about this, morons send me emails and say I'm lying.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.541]  I mean, it's literally hundreds of news articles every month.
[00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:27.143]  This is now broken through to the mainstream, and it's admitted in major states, what, now four states have banned it?
[00:18:27.143 --> 00:18:33.225]  You go to Target, you can hardly buy plastic wear now, it's almost all glass, because people know.
[00:18:33.225 --> 00:18:43.429]  But on average, a higher education level, certainly not wealthy people, but, you know, Walmart's very blue collar, and Target has a higher demographic, and then, you know, the average yuppies finally figure this out.
[00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:47.413]  Fifteen years after myself and others warned you.
[00:18:47.413 --> 00:18:51.238]  There were scientists fifty years ago when they adopted this warning, people, but they get laughed at.
[00:18:51.238 --> 00:18:52.600]  Okay, I've covered two articles here.
[00:18:54.431 --> 00:19:06.200]  But the government could care less about telling you that Gardasil vaccines are killing people and maiming them, or that H1N1's deadly or filled with mercury, or that GMO food in every major study, because it's designed to do that.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:15.407]  It's not accidentally every corn, every maize, every soybean crop, you know, just so happens to sterilize you and cause organ failure.
[00:19:15.407 --> 00:19:16.788]  It's designed like that.
[00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:19.070]  And we have the Rockefeller Foundation documents on it.
[00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.251]  We've covered them here.
[00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:21.512]  We've posted them on the websites.
[00:19:23.683 --> 00:19:26.806]  See, they don't care about all the real things that are screwing people up.
[00:19:26.806 --> 00:19:29.829]  You don't hear the government trying to restrict corn syrup, do you?
[00:19:29.829 --> 00:19:32.591]  On record, shutting down your pancreas.
[00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:33.312]  Highly toxic.
[00:19:34.528 --> 00:19:41.311]  Or the fact that they use toxic fertilizer on most of the food crops and the crops then bio-accumulate lead, mercury, arsenic.
[00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:42.592]  That's admitted.
[00:19:42.592 --> 00:19:44.193]  What's the headline?
[00:19:44.193 --> 00:19:47.474]  Half of corn syrup products have high levels of lead and mercury.
[00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:48.695]  Washington Post.
[00:19:48.695 --> 00:19:50.496]  See, they don't really care.
[00:19:50.496 --> 00:19:56.678]  They just want to act like they care and use that as an excuse to monitor and control your life while they're the ones killing us.
[00:19:56.678 --> 00:19:57.899]  See?
[00:19:57.899 --> 00:19:58.960]  Okay, I covered two articles.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.640]  We'll try to cover more.
[00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:05.263]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[00:20:05.263 --> 00:20:07.143]  That something is Atwood Rope.
[00:20:07.143 --> 00:20:09.244]  The highest quality rope made in the USA.
[00:20:09.244 --> 00:20:15.066]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborist, shipyards, towline, or boating.
[00:20:15.066 --> 00:20:18.768]  Quality rope at affordable prices you and your customers can depend on.

[00:20:27.491 --> 00:20:28.371]  Atwood Rope.
[00:20:28.371 --> 00:20:30.252]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[00:20:30.752 --> 00:20:31.993]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:31.993 --> 00:20:36.556]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:36.556 --> 00:20:42.360]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.002]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:46.002 --> 00:20:48.724]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.724 --> 00:20:53.787]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:53.787 --> 00:20:54.088]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:55.429]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.012 --> 00:21:05.256]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:21:05.256 --> 00:21:06.517]  Tyranny is here.
[00:21:06.517 --> 00:21:10.240]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.842]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:21:12.842 --> 00:21:18.546]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:21:18.546 --> 00:21:24.791]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:31.193]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:35.374]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:21:35.374 --> 00:21:39.655]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:21:39.655 --> 00:21:45.597]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:49.158]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:21:49.158 --> 00:21:51.119]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:51.559]  It's here.
[00:21:52.239 --> 00:21:59.984]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com, or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:59.984 --> 00:22:00.764]  Gold.
[00:22:00.764 --> 00:22:02.305]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:22:02.305 --> 00:22:08.589]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:08.589 --> 00:22:12.391]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:14.693]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:14.693 --> 00:22:17.135]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:25.222]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:22:25.222 --> 00:22:34.289]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.
[00:22:34.289 --> 00:22:35.590]  Don't gamble with your future.

[00:22:45.938 --> 00:22:50.762]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.762 --> 00:22:55.025]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.

[00:24:03.886 --> 00:24:05.288]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:24:05.288 --> 00:24:05.768]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:05.768 --> 00:24:08.531]  Many days we go into the fourth hour overdrive to 3 p.m.
[00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:09.212]  central.
[00:24:09.212 --> 00:24:10.614]  Back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:10.614 --> 00:24:13.157]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:13.157 --> 00:24:24.029]  So, finishing up with the fact that New York's already tried to pass laws saying that they will give them multi-thousand dollar fines at restaurants if they quote, over-salt food.
[00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:31.197]  And this is about the image and the message that government is your God, your mommy, your daddy.
[00:24:31.197 --> 00:24:33.598]  It's going to tell you what to do and take good care of you.
[00:24:33.598 --> 00:24:38.340]  So that people have this image of government as caring about us.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.361]  When they're using DU in the wars that are killing the troops, not just the enemies.
[00:24:43.101 --> 00:24:54.798]  When they're constantly getting caught running secret programs, injecting people with syphilis, with hepatitis, with HIV, with polio.
[00:24:54.798 --> 00:24:57.301]  But we don't want you to have salt.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:05.146]  We don't want you to have salt, and later I'm getting back into the big developments on the naked body scanner TSA front.
[00:25:05.146 --> 00:25:06.568]  It's the same thing there.
[00:25:06.568 --> 00:25:15.337]  You got a better chance of being struck by lightning, literally, twice in one year, than you do of dying in terrorism.
[00:25:15.337 --> 00:25:20.602]  I mean, you got 29,000 dead now in the last two years on the US-Mexican border.
[00:25:21.766 --> 00:25:23.107]  But that's kind of on the back burner.
[00:25:23.107 --> 00:25:23.928]  That's not a problem.
[00:25:23.928 --> 00:25:27.330]  That's a higher death rate per year than what Vietnam had.
[00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.033]  Vietnam over what, 10 years?
[00:25:30.033 --> 00:25:31.154]  64 to 74 was 58,000.
[00:25:31.154 --> 00:25:34.516]  Oh, but out of sight, out of mind.
[00:25:34.516 --> 00:25:36.418]  No, no, it's terrorist.
[00:25:36.418 --> 00:25:42.663]  And now they're banning mailing printer cartridges added to the huge list.
[00:25:42.663 --> 00:25:51.070]  So it's this perception management where things that do matter, they just put on the back burner, but things that don't matter, oh, we want to protect you.
[00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.491]  We're doing all of this to protect you.
[00:25:56.491 --> 00:26:01.313]  Continuing, a scientist finds dramatic damage to marine life near BP spill site.
[00:26:01.313 --> 00:26:07.495]  Yeah, and the government's told us the seafood's safe now for four months, even though all the private universities and others have openly been threatened.
[00:26:07.495 --> 00:26:18.699]  That's come out in mainstream news when they just study shrimp and fish just filled with the core exit and other chemicals, the different dioxins, the different things that are in the crude oil.
[00:26:21.238 --> 00:26:22.579]  And they're told, just don't worry about it.
[00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:25.161]  And remember Obama said, hey, core exits, no problem.
[00:26:25.161 --> 00:26:26.162]  There's no health problems.
[00:26:26.162 --> 00:26:27.443]  Remember he said that three times.
[00:26:27.443 --> 00:26:27.903]  Don't worry.
[00:26:27.903 --> 00:26:30.165]  Then they said, oh, the Gulf spill's been cleaned up.
[00:26:30.165 --> 00:26:32.107]  Out of sight, out of mind.
[00:26:32.107 --> 00:26:34.729]  That's CNN.
[00:26:34.729 --> 00:26:39.973]  Continuing with bizarre news, the Australian Barack Obama joined Muslim prayers at school, teacher says.
[00:26:43.721 --> 00:26:51.166]  And it goes on to say, as a schoolboy in Jakarta, Barack Obama attended Muslim prayer sessions with his classmates against the wishes of his mother.
[00:26:51.166 --> 00:26:54.608]  Well, we know he was in a Muslim school in Jakarta.
[00:26:54.608 --> 00:26:56.370]  We know he had the name Barry Sotero.
[00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.911]  We know he gave up his citizenship.
[00:26:57.911 --> 00:27:00.072]  If he is a Muslim, that's not bad.
[00:27:00.072 --> 00:27:01.473]  I'm not saying Muslims are bad.
[00:27:01.473 --> 00:27:09.819]  The point is, this guy did give up his citizenship, and that disqualifies him right there.
[00:27:11.345 --> 00:27:12.486]  So that's out of the Australian.
[00:27:12.486 --> 00:27:14.927]  Well, that's what happened in Arizona with the sanctuary cities.
[00:27:30.404 --> 00:27:33.366]  They don't need to prove their citizens to vote, so.
[00:27:33.366 --> 00:27:35.747]  Interesting report on that front.
[00:27:35.747 --> 00:27:41.451]  Continuing with India, since Obama's over there, he's about to go to the G20 in South Korea in Seoul.
[00:27:41.451 --> 00:27:43.672]  Harley-Davidson to build bikes in India.
[00:27:43.672 --> 00:27:47.914]  Remember Harley-Davidson a decade or so ago said, buy Harley, buy Harley.
[00:27:47.914 --> 00:27:50.076]  It's the only American-made motorcycle.
[00:27:50.076 --> 00:27:52.077]  And everybody went out and bought them.
[00:27:52.077 --> 00:27:54.658]  And for motorcyclists I talked to, they're not very good bikes.
[00:27:54.658 --> 00:27:58.240]  They look good, sound good, but they have a lot of problems.
[00:27:59.889 --> 00:28:01.830]  But there they go to India.
[00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:02.991]  Just the way it is, I guess.
[00:28:02.991 --> 00:28:08.715]  As long as they talk about how it's made in America, I guess everything's supposedly okay.
[00:28:08.715 --> 00:28:14.179]  So there, I went through, what, eight different stories on that front.
[00:28:14.179 --> 00:28:18.982]  When we come back, I'm gonna get into the huge developments on the TSA takeover of society.
[00:28:18.982 --> 00:28:20.423]  It's not just here in the U.S.
[00:28:20.423 --> 00:28:22.104]  They all have similar systems worldwide.
[00:28:22.104 --> 00:28:26.827]  This is a global corporate model and mode of control to train everybody to be slaves.
[00:28:26.827 --> 00:28:27.708]  I'm gonna get into that.
[00:28:29.142 --> 00:28:32.264]  When we come back from break.
[00:28:32.264 --> 00:28:42.489]  And then we're also gonna get into what's most important, in my humble opinion, what's happening with the economy, with gold.
[00:28:42.489 --> 00:28:48.752]  We have a doctor coming on to talk about, in studio, in the third hour, dealing with fluoride.
[00:28:48.752 --> 00:28:57.136]  But the minute I have here, before we go to break, this is out of the London Telegraph today, Large Hadron Collider Creates Many Big Bang With Lead Ions.
[00:28:58.072 --> 00:29:01.275]  Now they want to start accelerating uranium and plutonium into each other.
[00:29:01.275 --> 00:29:09.122]  The Large Hadron Collider has succeeded in recreating a miniature version of the Big Bang by smashing stripped down lead atoms together.
[00:29:09.122 --> 00:29:12.325]  The reaction created temperatures a million times hotter than the center of the sun.
[00:29:12.325 --> 00:29:13.827]  Boy, that's a good idea, isn't it?
[00:29:13.827 --> 00:29:15.208]  Start a chain reaction.
[00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:20.233]  Which have not been reached since the first billionths of a second following the Big Bang.
[00:29:20.233 --> 00:29:21.034]  They don't know that.
[00:29:22.796 --> 00:29:31.659]  This was expected to cause atomic particles such as protons and neutrons to melt, producing a soup of matter in the state previously unseen on Earth.
[00:29:31.659 --> 00:29:34.620]  And they're going to do thousands of these different types of things.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:48.006]  And they say low probability that it's going to destroy the Earth with each experiment, but when you do thousands of them... Scientists, including British particle physicists, will now study the particles in the hope of discovering what holds atoms together and gives them their mass.
[00:29:48.006 --> 00:29:48.586]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:48.906]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.936 --> 00:29:53.923]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.923 --> 00:29:57.552]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.047 --> 00:30:04.630]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:05.931]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:30:05.931 --> 00:30:10.335]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:30:10.335 --> 00:30:16.281]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:18.422]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:30:18.422 --> 00:30:21.105]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:27.951]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:30.153]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:30:30.153 --> 00:30:35.497]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:30:35.497 --> 00:30:40.782]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[00:30:40.782 --> 00:30:46.167]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:30:46.167 --> 00:30:47.668]  This will freeze the cost of your food
[00:30:47.748 --> 00:30:50.909]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:54.591]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:54.591 --> 00:30:55.831]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:27.421]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:34.463]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:31:34.463 --> 00:31:38.304]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:31:38.304 --> 00:31:39.524]  Others don't.
[00:31:39.524 --> 00:31:41.685]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:41.685 --> 00:31:43.466]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:32:56.678 --> 00:33:06.347]  Check them out today.
[00:33:06.347 --> 00:33:11.372]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.595 --> 00:33:34.596]  We are back live.
[00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:38.779]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday edition.
[00:33:38.779 --> 00:33:57.131]  I want to start getting into the latest developments with the TSA backlash that's happening here in the United States and similar backlashes across the world where the similar draconian control grid and dog training, slave training system is being put into place.
[00:33:59.589 --> 00:34:16.641]  But before I go any further, I wanted to let listeners know, and I know listeners have heard this countless times, when a caller calls in who's been listening six months, a year, two months, whatever the case may be, they say, yes, I woke up to the New World Order and I found your show.
[00:34:16.641 --> 00:34:20.624]  And I'll ask them, I'll say, how did you find the show?
[00:34:20.624 --> 00:34:22.566]  And more often than not, you would think
[00:34:23.815 --> 00:34:45.823]  Out of 200 million views, conservatively, on YouTube alone, of my videos and my show, that's just one venue, one forum that we're reaching people, on just eight YouTube channels we have, that's just our channels, and I kind of change the channel as an auxiliary because he posts our films, over 200 million.
[00:34:45.823 --> 00:34:47.844]  That's just on the channels that I've gone and counted them up.
[00:34:47.844 --> 00:34:48.544]  72 plus million
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:56.202]  That's up a million in the last week on the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:34:56.202 --> 00:35:08.605]  A million in the last week, but 72 plus million views on the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:35:08.605 --> 00:35:13.966]  I am so honored, I am so blessed to be in a position where I can reach hundreds of millions of people.
[00:35:13.966 --> 00:35:19.668]  That's not counting the thousands of other video sites where my videos and films and radio show
[00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:22.690]  are extremely prominent.
[00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:27.594]  But you notice with the callers, because I ask this every day, I'll say, oh, you just woke up, how'd you wake up?
[00:35:27.594 --> 00:35:37.461]  My friend, my neighbor, or a lady at a swap meet, or a lady at church, or a man at work, or my brother gave me a copy, a DVD.
[00:35:37.461 --> 00:35:46.287]  We get more calls, and more letters, and more emails, because when somebody's given a DVD, it's so personal, and they tend to watch it.
[00:35:46.287 --> 00:35:47.428]  They tend to value it more.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.103]  Most of them, of course, are burned copies, bootleg copies, which are not bootleg.
[00:35:52.103 --> 00:35:54.066]  We want you to make copies of them.
[00:35:54.066 --> 00:35:55.447]  I'm doing this to reach people.
[00:35:55.447 --> 00:36:03.956]  That's my goal, is to defeat these globalists, to stop the tyranny, to stop the medical experimentation, to stop this control grid we're under.
[00:36:03.956 --> 00:36:05.738]  But when you count
[00:36:09.523 --> 00:36:25.491]  200 million in the last two years, not counting all the years before that, not counting millions a day listening on the AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave Satellite, number one streaming internet show on the web according to ShotCast and other major aggregators that track that.
[00:36:25.491 --> 00:36:31.795]  To know that the biggest awakening is the listeners of this show who I salute and thank
[00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:36.125]  Buying the DVDs, making copies, and giving them out to people.
[00:36:36.125 --> 00:36:47.980]  Because it is that seed money, the people that buy the books, buy the DVDs, buy the t-shirts, buy the ballpoint pens, the license plate covers, the bumper stickers, most of it is sold almost at cost.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.623]  Every order gets a free citizen rule book.
[00:36:51.385 --> 00:37:02.069]  It is you supporting us with your PrisonPlanet.TV memberships, you name it, but also getting the films and supporting The Awakening, it's symbiotic, that are having the biggest effect.
[00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:07.972]  And that's why, until Christmas, we're doing the biggest sale we've ever had.
[00:37:07.972 --> 00:37:12.254]  I know the economy's in shambles, so you notice we just make the deals better and better.
[00:37:12.254 --> 00:37:20.437]  All of my top titles, all of them, and the new film I produced, Invisible Empire, by Jason Burmess, is excellent and very up-to-date.
[00:37:21.971 --> 00:37:26.737]  They're all buy one, get three free, or basically $4.90 a piece.
[00:37:26.737 --> 00:37:27.998]  Okay?
[00:37:27.998 --> 00:37:35.067]  So you buy it, you get four copies for $19.95, you've got gifts now for four people, or keep one for yourself.
[00:37:35.067 --> 00:37:37.590]  The Gift of Awakening, Endgame, Invisible Empire.
[00:37:38.609 --> 00:37:40.930]  Fall of the Republic, the Obama deception.
[00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:47.713]  We've got a bunch of other discounts and specials running as well right now, some of them that are even better than that deal.
[00:37:47.713 --> 00:37:55.136]  At Infowars.com, where we've got three great, two ladies and one great guy back there that answer the phones when you call.
[00:37:55.136 --> 00:38:01.759]  For years we had a 1-800 service and people would call up thinking it was us and asking them questions and folks didn't like that.
[00:38:01.759 --> 00:38:02.920]  So now we do it all ourselves.
[00:38:04.562 --> 00:38:08.288]  And so you can call here and place your order 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 888-253-3139
[00:38:18.908 --> 00:38:28.076]  Or InfoWars.com, or you can download all my films in super high quality, special video reports, expanded DVD extras that aren't on the DVDs.
[00:38:28.076 --> 00:38:33.280]  You notice that for two years I've been obsessed with this Eugenics film and never released it, and I can't wait.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:42.708]  I mean, it's all going to be in the film, all put together with the documentation, but you notice now three, four times a week, exclusive hour-long, two-hour-long interviews, never-before-seen,
[00:38:43.388 --> 00:38:50.956]  Flying people to Canada, flying people to, you know, Washington State, Florida, California, Indiana, Iowa.
[00:38:50.956 --> 00:38:53.418]  I mean, just everywhere.
[00:38:53.418 --> 00:38:56.561]  On average, sending two camera guys and the plane tickets and hotel and everything.
[00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:02.192]  Sometimes the people being interviewed don't want to be paid, which is fine for their time.
[00:39:02.192 --> 00:39:03.653]  $3,000, $4,000 per trip.
[00:39:03.653 --> 00:39:06.294]  And I'm just sitting on over 40 plus incredible interviews.
[00:39:06.294 --> 00:39:09.256]  So we're just putting them all on PrisonPlanet.tv, basically unedited.
[00:39:09.256 --> 00:39:10.756]  We just cut our questions out.
[00:39:10.756 --> 00:39:12.297]  Sometimes we even leave those in.
[00:39:12.297 --> 00:39:14.378]  I mean, what a brain trust of info.
[00:39:14.378 --> 00:39:16.819]  And they're getting millions of views online.
[00:39:16.819 --> 00:39:18.940]  You know, we post them first at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.081]  You get first exclusive.
[00:39:21.138 --> 00:39:25.883]  You get to download them, burn them to disk, but then it all filters out to the web as well.
[00:39:25.883 --> 00:39:26.584]  That's fine.
[00:39:26.584 --> 00:39:33.311]  It's you who do pony up and support us that allows us to do what we're doing.
[00:39:33.311 --> 00:39:34.893]  And so, thank you.
[00:39:34.893 --> 00:39:37.135]  And we are running a special, as we do every year.
[00:39:37.135 --> 00:39:40.699]  People say, well, next year, you know, how do I get the same deal?
[00:39:40.699 --> 00:39:42.501]  We'll just renew every year during the special.
[00:39:43.909 --> 00:40:07.163]  Uh, it's 5 plus months, comes up to 5.3 months free, so you pay for 3 point, you pay for 6.7 months and you get 5.3 months, over 5 months free when you sign up in November and December at PrisonPlanet.tv and we've turned it up in the last year where you can have, with your passcode, 6 people can be logged in with the same passcode at one time.
[00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:16.509]  So you can also share it with some friends and family, but tell them they can't share it, or you might get locked out sometimes when six people are logged on with your passcode.
[00:40:16.509 --> 00:40:26.175]  And I'd love to give it to everybody for free, but I talked about how when we, for two or three hours on a show sometimes now, we'll put up a free video stream box.
[00:40:26.175 --> 00:40:29.637]  It costs just $300, $400 just during the couple hours.
[00:40:29.637 --> 00:40:32.819]  And when I did 27 hours of live broadcast a few weeks ago, it cost about, what was it, $3,400, $3,500.
[00:40:32.819 --> 00:40:33.399]  So we can't do it.
[00:40:36.841 --> 00:40:39.343]  I mean, believe me, I would just give it all away for free.
[00:40:39.343 --> 00:40:41.585]  But I understand people out there know that.
[00:40:41.585 --> 00:40:45.427]  They understand how it is to run an operation to meet payroll and do all that.
[00:40:45.427 --> 00:40:48.330]  Also, please support our local AM and FM affiliates.
[00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.551]  Spread the word about their sponsors.
[00:40:50.551 --> 00:40:53.754]  That's a lot of stations have been picking us up and they really appreciate the support.
[00:40:54.454 --> 00:40:58.558]  A lot of commercial stations even get donations when they put us on from thankful people.
[00:40:58.558 --> 00:41:05.904]  I've got a lot of station owners and managers call me about that, or a lot of businesses step up and sponsor the local station because they appreciate that.
[00:41:05.904 --> 00:41:08.366]  I mean, you vote with your money.
[00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:12.009]  The globalists take your money and then use it against you.
[00:41:12.009 --> 00:41:13.691]  They use it against all of us.
[00:41:16.144 --> 00:41:18.446]  So they forcefully take it at the barrel of a gun.
[00:41:18.446 --> 00:41:19.446]  We don't do that.
[00:41:19.446 --> 00:41:22.709]  If you believe in what we're doing, and even if you have no money, that doesn't matter.
[00:41:22.709 --> 00:41:28.193]  It's spreading the word about the broadcast gets the word out, because that's the message at the end of the day.
[00:41:28.193 --> 00:41:29.294]  It just costs a lot of money.
[00:41:30.185 --> 00:41:30.365]  You know,
[00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:52.662]  I don't want to get off and talk about it anymore.
[00:41:52.662 --> 00:41:57.546]  The point is we couldn't do any of this without you and look at the effect we're all having together.
[00:41:57.546 --> 00:41:58.566]  It is so exciting.
[00:41:58.566 --> 00:41:59.947]  It is so beautiful.
[00:41:59.947 --> 00:42:07.613]  It is so buoying and refreshing to know the effect we're having.
[00:42:07.613 --> 00:42:11.215]  I also want to thank Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report.
[00:42:11.215 --> 00:42:16.419]  Drudge, I said yesterday, Drudge has been posting hardcore articles for three years.
[00:42:16.419 --> 00:42:19.621]  He's intensified posting hardcore news for three years.
[00:42:19.621 --> 00:42:20.322]  He's been doing it for 10.
[00:42:22.267 --> 00:42:23.888]  I guess forever, really.
[00:42:23.888 --> 00:42:31.131]  But, you know, it takes a lot of courage to every week link to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com articles.
[00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:38.415]  And now, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, five days, he's had our stories at the very top.
[00:42:38.415 --> 00:42:41.757]  Yesterday, two of our stories at the very top of Drudge.
[00:42:41.757 --> 00:42:45.159]  I mean, millions of visitors to InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:42:45.159 --> 00:42:47.900]  And Drudge is doing it because he's angry about the naked body scanners.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.361]  He's angry about Big Brother.
[00:42:49.361 --> 00:42:50.943]  I used to listen to his radio show.
[00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:52.504]  One of the few shows I really liked.
[00:42:52.504 --> 00:42:53.966]  I wish he wouldn't have quit doing it.
[00:42:53.966 --> 00:42:57.830]  Sunday evenings, what, 8 to 10 Central?
[00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:02.574]  And nobody's perfect.
[00:43:02.574 --> 00:43:05.137]  People's views politically change.
[00:43:05.137 --> 00:43:06.498]  We've been seeing that happen with Glenn Beck.
[00:43:07.758 --> 00:43:08.780]  I don't know.
[00:43:30.324 --> 00:43:30.444]  It's
[00:43:45.151 --> 00:43:46.372]  He posted it today.
[00:43:46.372 --> 00:43:49.093]  It's big sis backlash for TSA genitalia groping.
[00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:50.273]  That's one of ours.
[00:43:50.273 --> 00:43:54.715]  Pilots opt out rejecting naked body scanners of radiation danger privacy breach.
[00:43:54.715 --> 00:43:56.796]  That shows the big pilot unions are against it.
[00:43:56.796 --> 00:43:58.477]  That's our article.
[00:43:58.477 --> 00:44:02.979]  And then flyer patients wears thin at checkpoints.
[00:44:02.979 --> 00:44:04.819]  That's a Herald Tribune article.
[00:44:04.819 --> 00:44:07.460]  And I just knew he was going to post that.
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:13.023]  I understand Drudge just can't post InfoWars articles, but this is a big development.
[00:44:13.942 --> 00:44:19.266]  TSA responds to airport molestation complaints.
[00:44:19.266 --> 00:44:29.434]  And Watson did have the headline, which I think was accurate this morning, of TSA gives the figurative finger to... I thought that was a little too racy.
[00:44:29.434 --> 00:44:30.275]  It's a family site.
[00:44:31.616 --> 00:44:34.958]  So I had him change the TSA response to airport molestation complaints.
[00:44:34.958 --> 00:44:36.858]  And they just came out and said, yeah, we know people are angry.
[00:44:36.858 --> 00:44:38.439]  You can watch the video clip.
[00:44:38.439 --> 00:44:40.300]  They show some people saying they love it.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.181]  The media picks people that agree with it.
[00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:44.662]  And it's all to keep you safe from Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:44.662 --> 00:44:48.544]  And they just said, you know, this is scientific and we're going to do it.
[00:44:48.544 --> 00:44:51.765]  So I think that's important that they've responded.
[00:44:51.765 --> 00:44:59.709]  And it's a glib reaction, does nothing to address concerns vehemently voiced by numerous prominent travel and pilot associations.
[00:45:01.241 --> 00:45:17.086]  But for me it's like winning the Super Bowl to have stories that we report on breaking out into the national and international news and having an effect and showing there's been this huge opposition beneath the surface of the pilot unions and airline heads in the US and England and Europe and
[00:45:18.792 --> 00:45:24.998]  You know, so many other people, and TSA folks don't like it, so a lot of them quit, and they just hire goons who do like it.
[00:45:24.998 --> 00:45:35.067]  And it's coming out, the TSA guys hitting on women, planting cocaine on them, TSA being busted as pedophiles, TSA making women strip in front of people in public.
[00:45:35.067 --> 00:45:36.649]  This is all acts of humiliation.
[00:45:36.649 --> 00:45:39.791]  They've been ordered to do this, to see if the government can get away with this.
[00:45:39.791 --> 00:45:43.034]  See, the globalists are all about raw power.
[00:45:43.034 --> 00:45:43.395]  Just like
[00:45:44.724 --> 00:46:10.945]  From India, to Nigeria, to South Africa, to Egypt, to just all over South America, Peru's one of the big ones, Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, Congo, Libya, the UN got caught adding HIV to the shots, and there were hospital wards where everybody got HIV.
[00:46:12.762 --> 00:46:14.504]  I mean, they've been caught over and over again.
[00:46:14.504 --> 00:46:16.225]  You're like, what does this have to do with naked body scanners?
[00:46:16.225 --> 00:46:17.786]  They want to put their hands on you.
[00:46:17.786 --> 00:46:21.990]  They want to set the precedent to take your blood at checkpoints, as they've got federal grants to do.
[00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:23.231]  They want DNA databases.
[00:46:23.231 --> 00:46:25.774]  They take your baby's blood at birth.
[00:46:25.774 --> 00:46:27.395]  They want in your life.
[00:46:27.395 --> 00:46:28.736]  They want in your body.
[00:46:28.736 --> 00:46:34.942]  And they want an army of out-of-control, power-grabbing federal minions who aren't sworn peace officers
[00:46:36.226 --> 00:46:46.295]  Just out there trampling on everyone's rights, and the Fed's now announcing total control of all transportation, all schools, all power plants, all infrastructure.
[00:46:46.295 --> 00:46:49.698]  I mean, this is the new economy the government admitted more than a decade ago.
[00:46:49.698 --> 00:46:54.422]  The Rand Corporation said, we're going to be a service economy, but not the one you think.
[00:46:54.422 --> 00:47:02.029]  The service economy is going to be security guards, jail guards, data analysts, data miners, secret police, political officers.
[00:47:03.382 --> 00:47:04.803]  And now that's what we are.
[00:47:04.803 --> 00:47:16.291]  Do you understand that that's most of the tuitions that are being paid, the scholarships, the biggest group of them now, is to be part of this?
[00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:19.173]  To where even if you don't like it, that's the jobs.
[00:47:19.173 --> 00:47:20.394]  That's what America is.
[00:47:23.953 --> 00:47:30.578]  We're gonna open the phones up for the full second hour and the third hour on fluoride, but I want to tell you the subjects I want to hear from you on coming up here.
[00:47:30.578 --> 00:47:33.200]  You could probably take a wild guess.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:40.726]  I gotta get into the economy first, but TSA responds to airport molestation complaints.
[00:47:40.726 --> 00:47:42.668]  It's just incredible.
[00:47:42.668 --> 00:47:47.492]  And so why did the government, why did the US government with Israel,
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:48:05.891]  From 1952 to 1962, pay $3 billion in adjusted money to tell public school children in Israel that they were going to be checked for diseases and that it was a treatment for skin allergies.
[00:48:05.891 --> 00:48:07.432]  That's why they're called the ringworm children.
[00:48:07.432 --> 00:48:08.373]  It's a fungus.
[00:48:08.373 --> 00:48:09.394]  Nothing to do with that.
[00:48:09.394 --> 00:48:13.657]  But they were taking them to x-ray their heads in these high-powered systems.
[00:48:14.497 --> 00:48:21.961]  to cure them of ringworm, and then it came out it was eugenics, and it killed a lot of the children, maimed others, they're called the ringworm children.
[00:48:21.961 --> 00:48:24.902]  I talk about 4,000 plus radiated to death in the U.S.
[00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:25.802]  foster kids.
[00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:30.385]  The point is, it's every country does this, because it's a scientific dictatorship.
[00:48:30.385 --> 00:48:32.285]  And that was a test for Israel.
[00:48:32.285 --> 00:48:36.748]  Will you take poor Jews and murder them?
[00:48:36.748 --> 00:48:39.029]  And Israel said, absolutely.
[00:48:39.029 --> 00:48:39.669]  Heil Hitler.
[00:48:43.422 --> 00:48:48.269]  There's something big here, folks, okay?
[00:48:48.269 --> 00:48:54.237]  And that's what's going on.
[00:48:54.237 --> 00:48:55.258]  And in my film, Endgame,
[00:48:56.446 --> 00:49:04.153]  It shows on clips from Israeli TV, the government shot of the kids and they hit them with so much radiation all their hair would fall out.
[00:49:04.153 --> 00:49:05.214]  And they did different doses.
[00:49:05.214 --> 00:49:11.220]  Some of them they'd kill, some would die that day, others a month later, some would go blind.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.343]  And there's people all over Israel today, 40, 50 years old, who lived
[00:49:16.585 --> 00:49:19.886]  And they're blind, and they've got cancers, and you'll see them on the Israeli news.
[00:49:19.886 --> 00:49:21.287]  I mean, this is admitted.
[00:49:21.287 --> 00:49:23.308]  You know, people who are Israelis, they know all about it.
[00:49:23.308 --> 00:49:27.610]  The average American's like, what, the Israelis did this to 110,000 little Jewish kids?
[00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.990]  Yeah, folks, look, the globalists want to hurt everybody.
[00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.991]  I mean, you need to understand this.
[00:49:34.764 --> 00:49:37.006]  And so what does that have to do with TSA?
[00:49:37.006 --> 00:49:40.529]  It's about testing power, testing what they can get away with.
[00:49:40.529 --> 00:49:56.543]  I mean, imagine nurses have known for 39 years, whether you're in Australia, Germany, England, the US, all the westernized global empire governments, echelon countries, that at birth they say, this is going to the health department, honey, we're going to test for a blood disease.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:05.244]  And nobody ever asks, well, why doesn't the hospital just do a blood test or have a local clinic do it?
[00:50:05.244 --> 00:50:06.284]  That's the cover story.
[00:50:06.284 --> 00:50:08.486]  They do not test for the blood disease.
[00:50:08.486 --> 00:50:10.968]  No one ever gets contacted and told you have the disease.
[00:50:10.968 --> 00:50:12.249]  The hospital actually takes blood, too.
[00:50:12.249 --> 00:50:12.769]  They do test.
[00:50:12.769 --> 00:50:15.051]  Sometimes they contact you.
[00:50:15.051 --> 00:50:17.733]  It goes into a Pentagon UN database.
[00:50:17.733 --> 00:50:21.336]  That's now... And I get people like, yes, Alex, you talk about this every day.
[00:50:21.336 --> 00:50:22.917]  Because these are the key issues.
[00:50:22.917 --> 00:50:27.220]  We have this giant shadow medical scientific tyranny
[00:50:28.274 --> 00:50:31.938]  Running around, everywhere, murdering people.
[00:50:31.938 --> 00:50:44.672]  I mean, I remember it came out, what, six, seven years ago in New York Daily News, CPS workers quit over it, that they would take poor black children, CPS would, and take them and do pesticide studies on them, strap them down, and murder them with pesticides.
[00:50:44.672 --> 00:50:45.693]  Nobody got in trouble!
[00:50:45.693 --> 00:50:46.834]  I mean, come on!
[00:50:47.898 --> 00:50:51.120]  I mean, I mean, again, this goes to who is our government?
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.741]  They're psychopathic, scientific murderers.
[00:50:53.741 --> 00:50:58.404]  We're gonna get back into the latest developments on TSA, your phone calls, the economy, and a lot more.
[00:50:58.404 --> 00:50:58.824]  Stay with us.

[00:52:01.004 --> 00:52:05.968]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.968 --> 00:52:06.948]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.948 --> 00:52:09.410]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:10.411]  A republic.
[00:52:10.411 --> 00:52:13.073]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:13.073 --> 00:52:15.335]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.335 --> 00:52:17.356]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.356 --> 00:52:19.037]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:19.037 --> 00:52:20.358]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.358 --> 00:52:20.959]  Children?
[00:52:20.959 --> 00:52:22.080]  Our education?
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:22.900]  Our money?
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.563]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.923 --> 00:52:30.629]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.629 --> 00:52:31.891]  You're being warned.
[00:52:31.891 --> 00:52:32.913]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.913 --> 00:52:34.074]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:34.074 --> 00:52:34.996]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.996 --> 00:52:35.877]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.877 --> 00:52:38.401]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:53:00.635 --> 00:53:01.836]  Global meltdowns.
[00:53:01.836 --> 00:53:03.036]  Massive unemployment.
[00:53:03.036 --> 00:53:04.016]  Endless wars.
[00:53:04.016 --> 00:53:05.497]  A new currency crisis.
[00:53:05.497 --> 00:53:07.478]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:53:07.478 --> 00:53:09.839]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:53:09.839 --> 00:53:13.401]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?

[00:53:48.612 --> 00:53:49.072]  That's right.
[00:53:49.232 --> 00:53:51.394]  By the way, the Pentagon likes to do this.
[00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:18.251]  They did this on Y2K.
[00:54:18.251 --> 00:54:27.774]  ABC News reported that Russia had fired a missile, and then five minutes later said, oh, it was just a drill, don't worry about it, to try to get the public to report on it.
[00:54:27.774 --> 00:54:36.677]  It says, mystery missile launched, seen off California coast, military mum on nature of big missile, rising out of the Pacific, a possible show of U.S.
[00:54:36.677 --> 00:54:38.217]  military might.
[00:54:38.217 --> 00:54:39.578]  And there's a video of it.
[00:54:40.994 --> 00:54:45.798]  And for an hour or so, this really scared people before they came out and were basically mum.
[00:54:45.798 --> 00:54:47.119]  But it's obviously the military.
[00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:52.323]  So interesting report there from CBS News.
[00:54:52.323 --> 00:54:56.066]  Okay, getting into the TSA.
[00:54:56.066 --> 00:54:58.868]  This is really the big issue.
[00:54:58.868 --> 00:55:03.391]  This is out of WCVB-TV, Boston ABC 5.
[00:55:03.391 --> 00:55:07.435]  Illegals say TSA approved flight training.
[00:55:08.584 --> 00:55:19.052]  And it goes over how the federal government gives illegal aliens clearance to fly without any documentation or to rent aircraft, even large aircraft.
[00:55:19.052 --> 00:55:20.854]  See, this is a joke.
[00:55:20.854 --> 00:55:30.361]  And just like it came out two years ago that Homeland Security would do staged arrest, even when Bush was still in office, of illegal aliens and then go give them green cards and hire them.
[00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:33.023]  So it's all a complete joke.
[00:55:33.023 --> 00:55:34.504]  Again, you are the citizen.
[00:55:34.504 --> 00:55:37.427]  You are seen as the parasite's food.
[00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:42.011]  And so, you can see a video report up there as well.
[00:55:42.011 --> 00:55:45.153]  We've got it linked up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:45.153 --> 00:55:55.538]  Three Brazilian nationals accused of being in the country illegally while studying to be pilots at the Stowe Flight School said they were cleared by the Federal Transportation Security Administration for flight training.
[00:55:55.538 --> 00:55:57.339]  The TSA.
[00:55:57.339 --> 00:56:03.483]  The men who agreed to talk to News Center 5 under a condition of anonymity said they came to the United States legally but now have expired visas.
[00:56:03.483 --> 00:56:05.864]  They said the TSA never asked them about their immigration status.
[00:56:08.999 --> 00:56:10.400]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:15.622]  So, you are going to have your wife felt up, but foreigners or any... Oh, you want a big aircraft?
[00:56:15.622 --> 00:56:18.683]  Here, just take it.
[00:56:18.683 --> 00:56:19.883]  It's all made up.
[00:56:19.883 --> 00:56:22.644]  They're not worried about the illegal aliens.
[00:56:22.644 --> 00:56:24.365]  Okay?
[00:56:24.365 --> 00:56:25.745]  They're not worried about terrorism.
[00:56:25.745 --> 00:56:26.426]  They're training you.
[00:56:26.426 --> 00:56:29.627]  They get to put their hands on your wife and children and squeeze.
[00:56:29.627 --> 00:56:32.448]  You got that?
[00:56:32.448 --> 00:56:32.788]  U.S.
[00:56:32.788 --> 00:56:35.369]  tightens restrictions on cargo from Yemen and Somalia.
[00:56:39.619 --> 00:56:44.903]  They are now banning flying with ink cartridges or basically trying to mail them.
[00:56:44.903 --> 00:56:48.425]  Above 16 ounces is added to the new wide list.
[00:56:48.425 --> 00:56:49.526]  This is happening worldwide.
[00:56:49.526 --> 00:56:54.770]  Canada creates new security rules for passengers following bomb scare.
[00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:58.833]  And same thing, printer cartridges, enhanced pat-downs, all of it.
[00:57:03.365 --> 00:57:05.666]  So, this is how they get the job done.
[00:57:05.666 --> 00:57:18.732]  And I was looking at the YouTube video with 270-something thousand views of Michelle, one of my staff, being interviewed last week about how she was fondled in her 20-month-old and 8-year-old worm.
[00:57:18.732 --> 00:57:22.233]  And there was a commenter on there, and I happen to know this is the truth.
[00:57:22.233 --> 00:57:30.497]  He says, I happen to know that what this person's saying is the truth, that police aren't allowed to do this, but these TSA are.
[00:57:31.479 --> 00:57:34.142]  Just like nobody else is allowed to have these radiation x-ray machines.
[00:57:34.142 --> 00:57:35.823]  They are x-rayed.
[00:57:35.823 --> 00:57:37.425]  Without having, you know, radiation shielding.
[00:57:37.425 --> 00:57:38.366]  But here they just wave it.
[00:57:39.645 --> 00:57:41.165]  I was a cop for 25 years.
[00:57:41.165 --> 00:57:49.608]  Unless it was an emergency situation, a female officer had to be called to do any frisk of a woman or minor female.
[00:57:49.608 --> 00:57:50.688]  Had to!
[00:57:50.688 --> 00:57:52.209]  And this was for an arrest.
[00:57:52.209 --> 00:57:53.829]  You're being arrested.
[00:57:53.829 --> 00:58:04.032]  Absent a warrant, the policy of the TSA performed by civilian agents who do not have peace officer status is absolutely a violation of the Fourth Amendment rights.
[00:58:04.032 --> 00:58:05.552]  The answer to this outrage is simple.
[00:58:05.552 --> 00:58:06.273]  Do not fly.
[00:58:06.273 --> 00:58:07.193]  Enough people
[00:58:08.203 --> 00:58:12.848]  Need to say no and refuse to fly, the airlines will intercede with Congress and they'll stop this.
[00:58:12.848 --> 00:58:23.098]  And he had a mild expletive at the end I deleted for radio audiences.
[00:58:23.098 --> 00:58:28.264]  So continuing along these lines, we're going to open the phones up.
[00:58:30.097 --> 00:58:32.480]  Again, for victims of the TSA.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.681]  People need to hear this.
[00:58:33.681 --> 00:58:34.562]  Men, women, and children.
[00:58:34.562 --> 00:58:34.623]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:34.623 --> 00:58:34.703]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:34.703 --> 00:58:36.285]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.981 --> 00:58:52.642]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:59:12.295 --> 00:59:14.956]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:59:14.956 --> 00:59:21.458]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:59:21.458 --> 00:59:22.979]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:59:49.273 --> 00:59:53.836]  Thank you.
[00:59:53.836 --> 00:59:56.198]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.198 --> 00:59:59.060]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.697 --> 01:00:10.523]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.523 --> 01:00:12.125]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:13.667]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.667 --> 01:00:17.853]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.853 --> 01:00:21.918]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:28.351]  We've got a chance to reverse the TSA takeover of society.
[01:00:28.351 --> 01:00:31.192]  The federal governments worldwide have created similar organizations.
[01:00:31.192 --> 01:00:34.153]  They're carrying out the exact same squeezing pat-downs.
[01:00:34.153 --> 01:00:36.534]  The radiation bathing systems.
[01:00:36.534 --> 01:00:37.814]  There's a backlash in Europe.
[01:00:37.814 --> 01:00:39.035]  Italy and others are pulling them out.
[01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:39.375]  The U.S.
[01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:43.036]  government's offering to pay for the machines with taxpayer money if they'll do it.
[01:00:43.036 --> 01:00:49.278]  Because you see, they've got to force this worldwide, or their system of total control fails.
[01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:51.599]  And I've got more on the TSA.
[01:00:53.476 --> 01:01:03.082]  That I want to go over today, but I also need to get into the incredible developments on the economic front.
[01:01:03.082 --> 01:01:07.624]  So we're opening the phones up on two specific issues.
[01:01:07.624 --> 01:01:10.726]  You're welcome to call in on these two specific issues.
[01:01:10.726 --> 01:01:19.131]  Your eyewitness reports, I'll try not to interrupt, it's just so amazing to hear the stories of how you've been manhandled, fondled, how you've been screamed at.
[01:01:22.085 --> 01:01:22.866]  Or if you like it.
[01:01:22.866 --> 01:01:26.490]  I mean, whatever your view is on this, if it specifically happened to you.
[01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:34.820]  And secondarily, what's your take on gold at $1,420 plus today?
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.161]  And that's the last time I looked.
[01:01:36.161 --> 01:01:37.383]  In fact, where's gold right now, guys?
[01:01:37.383 --> 01:01:37.643]  Thanks.
[01:01:37.643 --> 01:01:38.664]  I meant to check it myself.
[01:01:38.664 --> 01:01:38.904]  Sorry.
[01:01:40.956 --> 01:01:45.279]  I want to get your view on that, and I want to get your view on dollar devaluation.
[01:01:45.279 --> 01:01:58.186]  I mean, the announcement that our government is going to devalue the dollar globally, and rip off everybody that's saved or invested in T-bills, rip off everybody, drive up the cost of living, drive down the standard of living.
[01:01:58.186 --> 01:02:01.868]  I mean, this is big news, and they're really doing it!
[01:02:01.868 --> 01:02:03.389]  I mean, how do we audit the Federal Reserve?
[01:02:03.389 --> 01:02:04.470]  How do we get rid of these people?
[01:02:07.234 --> 01:02:09.135]  That's $1,422.40.
[01:02:09.135 --> 01:02:11.897]  It's up over $2 just in the last 30 minutes.
[01:02:11.897 --> 01:02:15.019]  My goodness gracious.
[01:02:15.019 --> 01:02:23.243]  So we're going to be covering all of that as well, but I do want to go to your phone calls after this quick break.
[01:02:23.243 --> 01:02:27.686]  800-259-9231 is the number to join us.
[01:02:27.686 --> 01:02:30.908]  Another report, you know, I went over how illegal aliens can come to the U.S.
[01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:36.691]  Rent even large aircraft and fly around and TSA stamps it and approves it.
[01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:37.651]  Illegal aliens?
[01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:38.771]  Great.
[01:02:38.771 --> 01:02:41.732]  Citizens, we gotta squeeze your wife's breasts because they may be Al Qaeda.
[01:02:41.732 --> 01:02:47.653]  Again, General Aviation, wide open, it's all a fraud.
[01:02:47.653 --> 01:02:51.394]  Next they'll say they're taking blood from babies secretly, which they admit they're doing to stop Al Qaeda.
[01:02:51.394 --> 01:02:55.055]  I mean, 39 years ago to stop Al Qaeda?
[01:02:55.055 --> 01:02:56.855]  But here's a NBC
[01:02:59.336 --> 01:03:11.429]  10 News Report, I think it's NBC, and it says desert, deserted island being used by illegal immigrants.
[01:03:11.429 --> 01:03:20.439]  Deserted island being used by illegal immigrants, and it says San Diego News 10 uncovered the deserted island and the risky operation that's making it possible
[01:03:22.961 --> 01:03:25.702]  For illegal immigrants to sneak into San Diego.
[01:03:25.702 --> 01:03:30.165]  Abandoned fishing boats have become a common sight on the San Diego beaches.
[01:03:30.165 --> 01:03:36.328]  Very rarely are the passengers found, since they're illegal immigrants who were smuggled into the United States in the dark of night.
[01:03:36.328 --> 01:03:40.029]  Again, there's these turbaned terrorists that want to get us any minute.
[01:03:40.029 --> 01:03:42.211]  We've got to squeeze your wife's breast.
[01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:44.252]  We've got to squeeze your genitals.
[01:03:44.252 --> 01:03:46.613]  We've got to do all this or Al-Qaeda will get you.
[01:03:46.613 --> 01:03:50.835]  But illegal aliens can go rent a plane, TSA signs off on it.
[01:03:52.632 --> 01:04:15.761]  And at the same time, all over the country, from Canada and from, you can just walk right across, nobody stops you, but if you're a good little citizen and try to drive through, they harass you and go through your goods and, you know, my guys have driven back in and out of Canada doing interviews and, you know, they get stopped and, you know, you have a $5,000 camera, you have to prove you own this, you're not trying to escape customs.
[01:04:15.761 --> 01:04:20.403]  We have to fax up the purchase sheets from years ago, dig them out of storage,
[01:04:21.323 --> 01:04:25.525]  I spent like half my time just storing data so I can be spied on.
[01:04:25.525 --> 01:04:27.526]  I mean, it's just, it's just incredible.
[01:04:27.526 --> 01:04:29.367]  If you try to comply with all the garbage.
[01:04:29.367 --> 01:04:34.569]  But if you're an illegal alien, I mean, I ought to change my name to Juan Jose.
[01:04:34.569 --> 01:04:36.210]  Legally.
[01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:38.971]  You know, go down, I guess Mexico won't let me become a citizen though.
[01:04:38.971 --> 01:04:40.672]  Won't let me really buy property.
[01:04:40.672 --> 01:04:41.693]  Except in a few cases.
[01:04:42.915 --> 01:04:44.976]  And they'll shoot me if I'm caught being an illegal alien.
[01:04:44.976 --> 01:04:50.818]  But, point is, go to some third world country where they'll give me citizenship, change my name to Juan Jose, and then I'm God.
[01:04:50.818 --> 01:04:52.699]  Hey, you wanna walk around in an airplane?
[01:04:52.699 --> 01:04:54.800]  TSA's like, it's yours.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.781]  You wanna come ride it in boats and land?
[01:04:56.781 --> 01:04:57.961]  Government's not gonna guard that.
[01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:59.222]  Cause they're the terrorists.
[01:05:00.899 --> 01:05:05.442]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.442 --> 01:05:06.362]  Number 1.
[01:05:06.362 --> 01:05:09.785]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.785 --> 01:05:10.645]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.645 --> 01:05:15.528]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.528 --> 01:05:16.289]  It's true.
[01:05:16.289 --> 01:05:21.152]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.152 --> 01:05:21.972]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.972 --> 01:05:25.575]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.575 --> 01:05:29.257]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.457 --> 01:05:30.257]  Number 4.
[01:05:30.257 --> 01:05:33.018]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:33.018 --> 01:05:36.700]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.500]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:41.642]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.642 --> 01:05:46.684]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.684 --> 01:05:50.865]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.865 --> 01:05:52.646]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:01.071 --> 01:06:04.653]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:06:04.653 --> 01:06:05.774]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:06:05.774 --> 01:06:10.337]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:06:10.337 --> 01:06:16.281]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:06:16.281 --> 01:06:18.443]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:06:18.443 --> 01:06:21.105]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:06:21.465 --> 01:06:27.950]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.172]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:06:30.172 --> 01:06:35.516]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:06:35.516 --> 01:06:40.800]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:45.964]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:06:46.144 --> 01:06:49.346]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.

[01:06:52.348 --> 01:06:53.108]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:07:03.231 --> 01:07:04.532]  Other police action.
[01:07:04.532 --> 01:07:05.792]  Tyranny is here.
[01:07:05.792 --> 01:07:09.454]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:09.454 --> 01:07:11.955]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:11.955 --> 01:07:17.818]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:17.818 --> 01:07:24.061]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:24.481 --> 01:07:30.467]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:30.467 --> 01:07:34.650]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:38.934]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:38.934 --> 01:07:44.879]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:44.879 --> 01:07:48.442]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:48.442 --> 01:07:50.424]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:50.424 --> 01:07:50.845]  It's here.

[01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:04.791]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.791 --> 01:08:07.612]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.503 --> 01:08:13.784]  Okay, we're taking calls on two subjects.
[01:08:13.784 --> 01:08:18.625]  Are you a victim of TSA enslavement conditioning, re-education?
[01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.125]  That's what it is.
[01:08:20.125 --> 01:08:23.026]  I want to hear your story briefly.
[01:08:23.026 --> 01:08:32.728]  Yesterday it was so horrifying that I was trying to have gallows humor about a little bit of it to hear the stories of them lifting women's dresses up in front of everybody, screaming at people to humiliate them.
[01:08:32.728 --> 01:08:35.449]  This is all rolling out to the streets worldwide.
[01:08:36.587 --> 01:08:40.829]  And every major Western nation, same system, exact same names.
[01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:43.091]  This is all to condition us.
[01:08:43.091 --> 01:08:49.074]  But the good news is giant backlash, pilots unions, airline chiefs.
[01:08:49.074 --> 01:08:53.737]  And it was already starting a few weeks ago, so magically more bombs.
[01:08:53.737 --> 01:08:57.339]  Remember all that right before the election?
[01:08:57.339 --> 01:08:57.439]  And
[01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:05.414]  The police tested it and said it wasn't a bomb, and Obama came out and said it was a bomb, and they said, okay, we tested it again, it is a bomb.
[01:09:05.414 --> 01:09:10.716]  You diagnosed it from 7,000 miles away in D.C., Obama.
[01:09:10.716 --> 01:09:13.558]  And Anwar al-Awlaki out of Yemen, he's running it again.
[01:09:13.558 --> 01:09:14.758]  He's running Major Hassan.
[01:09:14.758 --> 01:09:18.060]  He's running the underwear bomber.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.701]  He's running the Times Square guy.
[01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:21.982]  He's hanging out at the Pentagon secretly.
[01:09:21.982 --> 01:09:22.583]  Oh, hey!
[01:09:22.583 --> 01:09:24.984]  I mean, it's all out in the open.
[01:09:26.505 --> 01:09:33.931]  And illegal aliens, mainstream news, can still, nine years after 9-11, walk in and rent any aircraft they want.
[01:09:33.931 --> 01:09:35.272]  And just take off.
[01:09:35.272 --> 01:09:36.834]  You got the money, honey, you got it.
[01:09:36.834 --> 01:09:38.615]  TSA approves it.
[01:09:38.615 --> 01:09:40.797]  Because they're an anti-terrorism organization.
[01:09:40.797 --> 01:09:42.839]  You've got to terrorize the American people.
[01:09:42.839 --> 01:09:44.340]  And to train us to be slaves.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:47.602]  And to build an army of goons that think this is normal.
[01:09:47.602 --> 01:09:50.485]  Of minimum wage people who can do whatever they want.
[01:09:52.588 --> 01:09:56.730]  But I also, when you get a chance to call in, when you hear somebody hang up, that's your chance.
[01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:57.930]  I want to get your take on the economy.
[01:09:57.930 --> 01:10:00.711]  I'm going to go through the economy at the bottom of the hour and continue with your calls.
[01:10:00.711 --> 01:10:02.612]  Let's talk to Lou in Pennsylvania.
[01:10:02.612 --> 01:10:04.213]  You're on the air, Lou.
[01:10:04.213 --> 01:10:05.633]  How you doing, Juan Jose?
[01:10:05.633 --> 01:10:06.734]  I love the show.
[01:10:06.734 --> 01:10:07.634]  Well, thank you.
[01:10:07.634 --> 01:10:10.615]  I'm above the law, Juan Jose.
[01:10:10.615 --> 01:10:13.376]  I'd like to thank you for the service that you're doing, Alex.
[01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.377]  I love the show.
[01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:19.399]  I catch all your stuff on YouTube when I do miss the show, and I think you're doing a great thing.
[01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:22.451]  Um, this TSA thing is an outrage.
[01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:24.772]  Uh, there's something I want to alert people to.
[01:10:24.772 --> 01:10:28.995]  I want you to be observant of TSA officials when you're in the airport after you get past security.
[01:10:28.995 --> 01:10:31.397]  Notice they're not servants, they're officials!
[01:10:31.397 --> 01:10:32.858]  Mmm!
[01:10:32.858 --> 01:10:35.039]  Uh, they're officials and, uh, just take a notice.
[01:10:35.039 --> 01:10:40.463]  What are they all showing each other on their cell phones when they're walking around past the security phone?
[01:10:40.463 --> 01:10:41.924]  I mean, I mean, the security gates.
[01:10:41.924 --> 01:10:42.084]  Just...
[01:10:42.535 --> 01:10:46.696]  And I don't understand why my employees don't get scanned or frisked.
[01:10:46.696 --> 01:10:51.797]  I haven't seen Janet Napolitano or Obama or Clinton get frisked or anything like that.
[01:10:51.797 --> 01:10:52.917]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:10:52.917 --> 01:10:53.657]  I'll say this.
[01:10:53.657 --> 01:10:59.058]  I have never been... Actually, one time, I think I was lightly years ago.
[01:10:59.058 --> 01:11:03.599]  I want to say JFK, but I'm going from memory.
[01:11:03.599 --> 01:11:08.360]  When I've come back into the country and Customs pulls up my computer, the guy always goes,
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.581]  And just starts looking at me, and a lot of times they want my autograph.
[01:11:12.581 --> 01:11:17.662]  I mean, literally, this happened last time I flew out and when I flew back in from San Jose.
[01:11:17.662 --> 01:11:23.723]  But when I go through, they're just like... And so, yes, they have already been flagged who you are as you're coming through.
[01:11:23.723 --> 01:11:27.164]  And I've seen Al Gore brought past security.
[01:11:27.164 --> 01:11:28.824]  We had a caller who saw it himself.
[01:11:28.824 --> 01:11:32.845]  But I've seen it myself at the Minneapolis International Airport.
[01:11:32.845 --> 01:11:35.626]  My wife began yelling at him about
[01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:39.491]  Just take a look around.
[01:11:39.491 --> 01:11:40.371]  I don't know.
[01:11:40.371 --> 01:11:46.314]  I don't want to speculate, but I think it's kind of unique that they all compare something on their phones.
[01:11:46.314 --> 01:11:50.136]  I don't know if they're because they're bringing phones into the screening room.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.001]  And taking pictures?
[01:12:02.001 --> 01:12:02.422]  I don't know.
[01:12:02.422 --> 01:12:03.883]  I can only speculate.
[01:12:03.883 --> 01:12:11.669]  I will say, I felt, um, I talked to one of my buddies who had to go through the security scan when we were both flying out of an airport.
[01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:17.294]  And, uh, he, he answered to me was, uh, he went for the frisk and he said, you know, I kind of felt guilty.
[01:12:17.294 --> 01:12:19.996]  I felt like I should have tipped the guy.
[01:12:19.996 --> 01:12:24.080]  Cause it was like a strip club.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.944]  And he says, you know, the guy did a very, it's, it's dehumanizing.
[01:12:29.654 --> 01:12:41.522]  It takes away from what we are, the greatness that we are, but getting the information out is important, but I think there's a peaceful solution to this, and it's a time to take action that delivers results.
[01:12:41.522 --> 01:12:54.711]  Getting information out is the first stage, and I would like to recommend a boycott of American companies that took money, like GM and Chrysler, because if their representatives are not going to listen to us,
[01:12:55.487 --> 01:12:58.230]  They're going to listen to the executives of these companies.
[01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:16.503]  I mean, each airline, it was more money than some of the individual airlines made in a year.
[01:13:16.503 --> 01:13:19.346]  That was a payoff to go along with this.
[01:13:19.346 --> 01:13:28.974]  They take our tax money, just like they said a month ago when Italy and other countries started pulling the naked body scanners out, the federal government said, we'll pay you to put them in.
[01:13:28.974 --> 01:13:30.276]  We'll pay for it.
[01:13:30.276 --> 01:13:32.137]  Don't let a backlash start.
[01:13:32.137 --> 01:13:36.021]  Because if the little ants ever stand up to us, they outnumber us 100 to 1.
[01:13:37.142 --> 01:13:40.083]  You know, don't let our house of cards, we're going to roll this out on the streets.
[01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:40.543]  We are.
[01:13:40.543 --> 01:13:44.405]  This is our big re-education camp dehumanization program.
[01:13:44.405 --> 01:13:46.366]  That's the right word, Lou, dehumanization.
[01:13:46.366 --> 01:13:48.467]  You know, no, no.
[01:13:48.467 --> 01:13:51.388]  And the head of British Airways says, I want them out.
[01:13:51.388 --> 01:13:51.928]  Oh, really?
[01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:54.889]  Well, how about a cartridge bomb?
[01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:57.550]  How about two days after we mail some bombs to you?
[01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:01.792]  How's that sound, Mac?
[01:14:01.792 --> 01:14:03.613]  Let's go ahead and talk to Frank in Texas.
[01:14:03.613 --> 01:14:04.313]  Frank, you're on the air.
[01:14:04.986 --> 01:14:06.207]  Hey Alex, I love your show.
[01:14:06.207 --> 01:14:07.088]  Just two quick points.
[01:14:07.088 --> 01:14:13.953]  I've been traveling a lot lately and I was warned in advance that the pat-downs were going to get a little more invasive.
[01:14:13.953 --> 01:14:16.315]  A little more invasive, yeah.
[01:14:16.315 --> 01:14:17.336]  As if there was room to go.
[01:14:17.336 --> 01:14:20.238]  But the last one, right when they got to my crotch, they did like a quick
[01:14:20.802 --> 01:14:24.803]  Thrust upward near my testicles and basically rack to me.
[01:14:24.803 --> 01:14:26.143]  You know, it's kind of out of breath.
[01:14:26.143 --> 01:14:28.064]  No, that's what the news admits.
[01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:30.384]  They press and people describe it as being lifted.
[01:14:30.384 --> 01:14:40.827]  It's like, I mean, I mean, pretty soon they'll take a ball peen hammer out and an anvil and say, put them on there and just, you know, and it's like, that's how we make sure that isn't a bomb in there.
[01:14:41.847 --> 01:14:45.291]  I mean, how do they know a woman doesn't have breast bombs by squeezing it?
[01:14:45.291 --> 01:14:46.853]  They say C.I.A.
[01:14:46.853 --> 01:14:52.199]  Alaki from the Pentagon is going to sew these bombs in, Fox News, AP.
[01:14:52.199 --> 01:14:53.020]  I mean, how do they know?
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.903]  Well, now they're saying we're looking at chest x-rays.
[01:14:55.903 --> 01:14:57.024]  Ma'am, come over here.
[01:14:57.024 --> 01:14:59.367]  I'm a $10 an hour medical technician.
[01:15:00.983 --> 01:15:04.285]  So your friend described it as being racked, or you're saying this happened to you?
[01:15:04.285 --> 01:15:05.986]  No, this happened to me.
[01:15:05.986 --> 01:15:15.092]  Yeah, because I've been... So what did you say when he like... And I've had some prudes send me emails saying I shouldn't talk about this, it's disgusting.
[01:15:15.092 --> 01:15:18.214]  I don't ever talk about things like this on air.
[01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:24.257]  We've got a bunch of men and women grabbing little kids and grabbing us, and you know, oh, you don't want the body scanner?
[01:15:24.257 --> 01:15:28.260]  I'm gonna squeeze, and now they're announcing even if you go to the body scanner, they're gonna do this after.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.621]  That's in a bunch of the articles.
[01:15:30.621 --> 01:15:32.902]  After you do the scanner, they say, come here.
[01:15:32.902 --> 01:15:40.406]  And you know, they've got some guy there who's got a little exercise machine to make his grip be as powerful as possible.
[01:15:40.406 --> 01:15:41.907]  They got Arnold Schwarzenegger in there.
[01:15:41.907 --> 01:15:44.568]  I mean, I'm trying to make a joke out of this, but it's not funny.
[01:15:44.568 --> 01:15:45.589]  Go ahead.
[01:15:45.589 --> 01:15:49.231]  I was just going to say, have you given any thought to maybe having an interview with
[01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:50.050]  Yeah.
[01:16:07.501 --> 01:16:35.389]  uh... or or or the system trying to get retribution in their eyes and so persecuting them to punish them but if a TSA worker can get in I'd like to hear them talk about what is going on because I do see them showing each other cell phones and looking and what they're getting is data on certain passengers uh... and you know my dad two years ago or almost three years ago was driving back from our family farm in east texas that he visits every week or two and he got pulled over on a little quiet road and the guy said you know you were doing 75 in a 65
[01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:41.795]  My dad said yes, and he said, well, Dr. Jones, and my dad's like, well, how do you know that?
[01:16:41.795 --> 01:16:44.636]  And he goes, well, I know about your son, Alex Jones, you know, too.
[01:16:44.636 --> 01:16:49.837]  And he knew everything about him and told him, oh, yeah, I've got you in a database, everything about your family.
[01:16:49.837 --> 01:17:00.379]  And it was the same thing that happened with Enterprise Rent-A-Car when I flew into San Francisco a few weeks ago, and then I flew out in San Jose.
[01:17:02.307 --> 01:17:07.630]  I go up, and she says, oh, the History Channel, you said the History Channel's paying for your car?
[01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:12.654]  I can see it in here, because I was also being interviewed by them, so they were paying for my car.
[01:17:12.654 --> 01:17:14.455]  I can see it in the computer, but it's not working.
[01:17:14.455 --> 01:17:16.316]  Just give me your credit card.
[01:17:16.316 --> 01:17:20.238]  And she said, I promise, as soon as this computer's fully back up, I'll do it.
[01:17:20.238 --> 01:17:28.444]  Well, I got the $900 bill because I didn't haggle the price this week, and the History Channel's having to go through it to pay for it.
[01:17:28.444 --> 01:17:29.364]  She never did it.
[01:17:29.364 --> 01:17:30.185]  But then at the end,
[01:17:31.545 --> 01:17:33.587]  She said, I see your address is this on your license.
[01:17:33.587 --> 01:17:35.549]  But she said, this is where you really live.
[01:17:35.549 --> 01:17:37.450]  And I've gone to great trouble.
[01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:38.531]  People think they know where I live.
[01:17:38.531 --> 01:17:39.952]  They don't.
[01:17:39.952 --> 01:17:42.855]  To have that obscure public figure.
[01:17:42.855 --> 01:17:44.436]  And she just giggled and laughed.
[01:17:44.436 --> 01:17:45.397]  She knew everything.
[01:17:45.397 --> 01:17:48.860]  She had the same database because she's part of infrastructure protection.
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:51.983]  And she was asking every person as they went to the airport, where are you going?
[01:17:51.983 --> 01:17:53.504]  This is 11 o'clock at night.
[01:17:53.504 --> 01:17:54.365]  I'm sitting there exhausted.
[01:17:54.365 --> 01:17:55.146]  There's families there.
[01:17:55.666 --> 01:17:56.767]  And she's like, where are you going?
[01:17:56.767 --> 01:17:57.507]  How are you doing?
[01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.228]  And people are like, oh, I'm going to see my mom.
[01:17:59.228 --> 01:17:59.748]  Oh, your mom?
[01:17:59.748 --> 01:18:01.129]  Where does she live?
[01:18:01.129 --> 01:18:09.433]  She's a little secret police officer, and she's there on this power trip, and the TSA workers have now been given national security clearance.
[01:18:09.433 --> 01:18:10.574]  It's all part of InfraGard.
[01:18:10.574 --> 01:18:17.738]  But I'm sorry, why would you specifically, Frank, want to hear from a TSA person?
[01:18:17.738 --> 01:18:19.299]  What do you want to hear from a TSA person on?
[01:18:19.775 --> 01:18:24.119]  I think it'd be interesting to just find out about the culture of perversion and what's going on in there.
[01:18:24.119 --> 01:18:33.268]  You know, one thing I also noticed when I try to warn them about the radiation danger, and they all give me a real robotic type response, always it's the same thing.
[01:18:33.268 --> 01:18:34.850]  Different people say the same thing.
[01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:37.332]  Oh, it's equivalent to 15 minutes of flight in an airplane.
[01:18:38.055 --> 01:18:42.276]  And, you know, you can tell they've all been trained to say that every time to everybody.
[01:18:42.276 --> 01:18:43.977]  Well, that's actually true!
[01:18:43.977 --> 01:18:55.900]  And that's why studies show that pilots have all sorts of health problems, even though they're in great shape and go blind early and a lot of other things, because there is... and every time I talk about this, I get emails because people are ignorant.
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:59.781]  I appreciate your call, Frank.
[01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:02.162]  Every time I say there's 10 feet of water from
[01:19:03.573 --> 01:19:05.854]  Sea level to 30,000 feet.
[01:19:05.854 --> 01:19:07.454]  People go, there's no water up there.
[01:19:07.454 --> 01:19:09.195]  Yeah, there is.
[01:19:09.195 --> 01:19:16.977]  On average, with average humidity, it's a little over 10 feet of water in the first 30,000 feet, if you condensed it down.
[01:19:16.977 --> 01:19:20.358]  That's what an Acola blue water filter does, it grabs it out of the air, it's clouds.
[01:19:20.358 --> 01:19:24.439]  And that is incredible shielding from the solar radiation.
[01:19:24.439 --> 01:19:29.200]  There's also on average, depending on the study, a centimeter to an inch of rock
[01:19:30.305 --> 01:19:33.627]  So it's not just shooting through water.
[01:19:33.627 --> 01:19:39.189]  There's a centimeter, depending on where they do the studies with airplanes, to an inch of rock.
[01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:43.672]  All those particulate, all that dust, potash in the air, it has to shoot through.
[01:19:43.672 --> 01:19:50.895]  And so, it is the equivalent, I don't know if it's 15 minutes, of the radiation you're getting while you're flying.
[01:19:50.895 --> 01:19:52.016]  And that's why we get cancer.
[01:19:52.016 --> 01:19:53.457]  It's radiation from the sun.
[01:19:53.457 --> 01:19:55.658]  It damages our DNA.
[01:19:55.658 --> 01:19:57.238]  But they're just idiots.
[01:19:57.238 --> 01:19:58.179]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:20:01.388 --> 01:20:05.472]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.472 --> 01:20:09.976]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.976 --> 01:20:16.142]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:16.142 --> 01:20:18.564]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:24.550]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.650 --> 01:20:28.054]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:28.054 --> 01:20:29.936]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.936 --> 01:20:32.119]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:36.984]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:36.984 --> 01:20:37.825]  Guaranteed.

[01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:50.134]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:50.134 --> 01:20:50.874]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:50.874 --> 01:20:52.115]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:21:00.868 --> 01:21:05.832]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:21:05.832 --> 01:21:06.832]  What have we got?
[01:21:06.832 --> 01:21:09.274]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:21:09.274 --> 01:21:10.275]  A republic.
[01:21:10.275 --> 01:21:12.937]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:21:12.937 --> 01:21:15.199]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:21:15.199 --> 01:21:17.220]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.901]  So they think they own our land?
[01:21:18.901 --> 01:21:20.222]  They think they own our water?
[01:21:20.222 --> 01:21:20.823]  Children?
[01:21:20.823 --> 01:21:21.944]  Our education?
[01:21:21.944 --> 01:21:22.784]  Our money?
[01:21:22.784 --> 01:21:26.447]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:21:26.787 --> 01:21:30.492]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:21:30.492 --> 01:21:31.754]  You have been warned.
[01:21:31.754 --> 01:21:32.795]  We have the facts.
[01:21:32.795 --> 01:21:33.957]  We have the Constitution.
[01:21:33.957 --> 01:21:34.858]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:21:34.858 --> 01:21:35.739]  We have common law.
[01:21:35.739 --> 01:21:38.263]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:38.263 --> 01:21:42.048]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:21:42.148 --> 01:21:47.111]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:48.592]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:21:48.592 --> 01:21:49.692]  Don't tread on me.
[01:21:49.692 --> 01:21:56.556]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:22:01.064 --> 01:22:05.249]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:22:05.249 --> 01:22:06.690]  dollar has been evaluating.
[01:22:06.690 --> 01:22:10.674]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:22:10.674 --> 01:22:13.417]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[01:22:13.417 --> 01:22:15.400]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.722]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:22:18.723 --> 01:22:27.754]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:22:27.754 --> 01:22:30.997]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:22:30.997 --> 01:22:34.101]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[01:23:00.296 --> 01:23:02.077]  Normal blood pressure, naturally!
[01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:03.418]  How would that make you feel?
[01:23:03.418 --> 01:23:05.119]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:23:05.119 --> 01:23:07.680]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:15.224]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:16.745]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:23:16.745 --> 01:23:19.486]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:23:19.486 --> 01:23:24.789]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:23:24.789 --> 01:23:29.852]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:23:30.012 --> 01:23:35.114]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:23:35.114 --> 01:23:39.536]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:44.238]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:23:44.238 --> 01:23:47.620]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:52.322]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:23:52.322 --> 01:23:56.364]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:24:25.111 --> 01:24:28.272]  The seasons don't fear the reaper.
[01:24:28.272 --> 01:24:37.735]  Yeah, I'll be with my grandfathers.
[01:24:37.735 --> 01:24:42.777]  With my great grandmothers.
[01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:45.558]  All I want to do is leave a better world to humanity.
[01:24:45.558 --> 01:24:46.638]  My love of humanity.
[01:24:46.638 --> 01:24:48.699]  My love letter to the future.
[01:24:48.699 --> 01:24:49.719]  My love letter.
[01:24:49.719 --> 01:24:52.640]  You know, I'll be sad when I'm dead.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.381]  Or I'm melancholy, I think about it.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:59.504]  Because I won't be able to experience this third dimension and all the goodness in the world.
[01:24:59.504 --> 01:25:02.448]  But others will experience it.
[01:25:02.448 --> 01:25:04.710]  And once you understand that, you're invincible.
[01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:06.732]  Once you're not scared of dying.
[01:25:06.732 --> 01:25:12.939]  Once you're not scared of being intimidated or being yelled at because you don't go along with oppression.
[01:25:12.939 --> 01:25:14.601]  Let's talk to Quentin in Maryland.
[01:25:14.601 --> 01:25:15.582]  Quentin, you're on the air.
[01:25:15.582 --> 01:25:15.963]  Go ahead.
[01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:32.486]  Hey, I'm a small business owner out here in Maryland, Alex, and you know, the system and the global elite have done all these things to just pressure us and to put us into like a pressure cooker, and I heard you talking about a couple things this morning and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I'm a first-time caller.
[01:25:32.486 --> 01:25:33.747]  How you doing?
[01:25:33.747 --> 01:25:34.208]  I'm good.
[01:25:34.208 --> 01:25:35.049]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:25:36.192 --> 01:26:05.351]  Well, here's the thing, Alex, you know, um, my in-laws, one of them's an FBI secretary, one of them's a Capitol Police officer, and, uh, my anti-government views, uh, pushed my wife and I into divorce, so I'm fighting the battle on that front, and then I'm a small business owner, and the dollar's devaluing, and that, you know, the, in, in Maryland here a few years back, not only do they tax you when you're successful, and you sell product and you sell inventory and make money, but also at the end of the year they tax you on your unsold inventory.
[01:26:05.811 --> 01:26:08.033]  They call it a year-end inventory tax.
[01:26:08.033 --> 01:26:08.573]  No, no, no.
[01:26:08.573 --> 01:26:09.574]  Same thing.
[01:26:09.574 --> 01:26:12.976]  They have four new taxes in Texas, and it just devastates us.
[01:26:12.976 --> 01:26:15.178]  And they try to send inspectors in here.
[01:26:15.178 --> 01:26:16.039]  We always refuse.
[01:26:16.039 --> 01:26:18.200]  It's all color of law.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:28.568]  Every computer, every camera, every piece of paper, every printer, all of our equipment, they put this giant tax, and they have a hospital district tax.
[01:26:28.568 --> 01:26:30.489]  They have an unsold inventory tax.
[01:26:30.489 --> 01:26:31.370]  It's just insane.
[01:26:32.475 --> 01:26:32.735]  Right.
[01:26:32.735 --> 01:26:41.097]  So, I mean, I'm taking it on the personal family front, and I'm taking it on the professional front, and you understand what I'm talking about there, and the traveling.
[01:26:41.097 --> 01:26:44.818]  You know, my way of protesting the PSA people is, I don't fly anymore.
[01:26:44.818 --> 01:26:46.958]  I just won't do it, because I saw all this coming.
[01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:52.180]  And then I got into the ideology of, well, trying to be a little bit more self-sufficient.
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.000]  You know, I want to collect some rainwater and filter it.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.722]  I've gotten into doing some ethical Christian biblical hunting, where I don't go out and hunt for rats, but I actually eat the meat, you know, that kind of thing.
[01:27:02.282 --> 01:27:06.085]  And they're actually attacking me on that front there.
[01:27:06.085 --> 01:27:09.248]  You talked about this morning about the salt restriction.
[01:27:09.248 --> 01:27:11.369]  I gotta tell you, brother, you gotta understand.
[01:27:11.369 --> 01:27:20.916]  Them limiting salt is not just about controlling what we eat, though that's a big part of it, but salt is a major, major preservative.
[01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:25.320]  And if you have salt, and you know how to pan hides, and you know how to use hides,
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:36.473]  And by the way, you have all that hard programming in your genetic code to hunt.
[01:27:36.473 --> 01:27:37.995]  That's why it feels so good.
[01:27:37.995 --> 01:27:43.642]  You don't even enjoy killing the animal, but it's the hunting, it's the gutting, it's the butchering.
[01:27:44.122 --> 01:27:47.166]  It's just like planting plants feels so good.
[01:27:47.166 --> 01:27:51.210]  Collecting wild plums or grapes feels good.
[01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:56.075]  It feels magic while you're doing it because that's what you're designed to do.
[01:27:56.075 --> 01:27:59.599]  And you're making really good points.
[01:27:59.599 --> 01:28:01.061]  I appreciate your call, Quentin.
[01:28:01.061 --> 01:28:02.903]  Good to have you on board with us.
[01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:04.405]  Let's talk to Tim in Washington.
[01:28:04.405 --> 01:28:05.126]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:28:06.257 --> 01:28:06.878]  Hello?
[01:28:06.878 --> 01:28:07.459]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:07.459 --> 01:28:08.200]  Hi, Alex.
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:08.780]  How are you doing?
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:08.981]  Good.
[01:28:08.981 --> 01:28:12.004]  I had a question about the private Viper team threat.
[01:28:12.004 --> 01:28:16.911]  I mean, what exactly is the precedence for them to, like, stop me on the street?
[01:28:16.911 --> 01:28:19.094]  Well, the precedence is they're completely out of control.
[01:28:19.094 --> 01:28:23.479]  They started it in New York with Army and National Guard out searching people.
[01:28:23.479 --> 01:28:24.100]  They started it...
[01:28:24.981 --> 01:28:37.832]  Then in Boston and Houston, I mean, they've had Viper teams on the streets for nine years, and now they say random checkpoints, malls, but instead of having more highly paid and trained police, it's TSA.
[01:28:37.832 --> 01:28:40.694]  And you can just search Viper teams on the streets.
[01:28:40.694 --> 01:28:42.395]  They now do knock and talks.
[01:28:42.395 --> 01:28:44.277]  Feds come to your door and ask about your guns.
[01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:47.359]  They're doing it in Chicago and also in Boston.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:48.360]  This is
[01:29:08.405 --> 01:29:10.566]  There's all these boats landing in California.
[01:29:10.566 --> 01:29:12.507]  I covered that earlier with illegals pouring off.
[01:29:12.507 --> 01:29:13.528]  No one stops them.
[01:29:13.528 --> 01:29:14.789]  No one secures it.
[01:29:14.789 --> 01:29:17.430]  Illegal aliens can come right in and rent any airplane they want.
[01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:18.611]  That's mainstream news today.
[01:29:18.611 --> 01:29:26.235]  And again, it's all about this is literal re-education camp brainwashing, Tim.
[01:29:26.235 --> 01:29:28.317]  And anything else you want to add?
[01:29:28.317 --> 01:29:28.817]  Yes, sir.
[01:29:28.817 --> 01:29:37.282]  About the economy falling and the dollar collapse, I was wondering if there was a possible last chance effort with the Congress being the way it is to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:29:37.921 --> 01:29:43.364]  I'll tell you what, stay there until we come back and finish up with you, then Kristen, Sam, Mortis, and others.
[01:29:43.364 --> 01:29:44.044]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:44.044 --> 01:29:45.525]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:45.525 --> 01:29:47.146]  GCNLive.com.
[01:29:47.146 --> 01:29:48.387]  That's the letters.
[01:29:48.387 --> 01:29:51.408]  GCNLive.com.
[01:29:51.408 --> 01:29:52.809]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.809 --> 01:29:55.330]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.330 --> 01:29:58.032]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.964 --> 01:30:06.925]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.925 --> 01:30:15.786]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.786 --> 01:30:20.407]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:20.407 --> 01:30:31.229]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.869 --> 01:30:41.371]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:41.371 --> 01:30:46.813]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.813 --> 01:30:54.294]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:54.294 --> 01:30:57.055]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:02.193 --> 01:31:06.217]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:06.217 --> 01:31:09.460]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:14.244]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:14.244 --> 01:31:20.650]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.650 --> 01:31:22.893]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:23.413 --> 01:31:23.713]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:23.713 --> 01:31:24.233]  Bernanke?
[01:31:24.233 --> 01:31:24.914]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:24.914 --> 01:31:26.174]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:26.174 --> 01:31:28.435]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:42.321 --> 01:31:49.607]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:31:49.607 --> 01:31:58.714]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:00.714 --> 01:32:05.256]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.256 --> 01:32:06.177]  Number 1.
[01:32:06.177 --> 01:32:09.599]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.599 --> 01:32:10.459]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.459 --> 01:32:15.342]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.342 --> 01:32:16.082]  It's true.
[01:32:16.082 --> 01:32:20.965]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.965 --> 01:32:21.785]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.785 --> 01:32:25.367]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.367 --> 01:32:29.069]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.269 --> 01:32:30.069]  Number 4.
[01:32:30.069 --> 01:32:32.831]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.831 --> 01:32:36.512]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.512 --> 01:32:37.292]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.292 --> 01:32:41.454]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.454 --> 01:32:46.496]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.496 --> 01:32:50.678]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.678 --> 01:32:52.459]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.459 --> 01:32:57.061]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:32:57.541 --> 01:33:06.168]  877-327-0365.
[01:33:06.168 --> 01:33:12.213]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:12.213 --> 01:33:14.756]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:33.459 --> 01:33:35.960]  It is Tuesday, the 9th day of November, 2010.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:38.401]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:38.401 --> 01:33:49.844]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, we're going to have a doctor in studio with us, PhD, top toxicologist, head of the Fluoride Action Network, exposing the dangers of fluoride.
[01:33:49.844 --> 01:33:57.327]  This is one place of many, but a big area that we can take control of our lives in.
[01:33:57.327 --> 01:33:57.987]  Now, Tim,
[01:33:59.511 --> 01:34:00.211]  in Washington.
[01:34:15.327 --> 01:34:16.868]  I think?
[01:34:43.942 --> 01:34:46.484]  Aren't allowed to get away with.
[01:34:46.484 --> 01:34:48.225]  And so that's what's happening on that front.
[01:34:48.225 --> 01:34:49.606]  They can get away with murder.
[01:34:49.606 --> 01:35:07.120]  So instead of getting rid of the derivatives, they actually allowed derivatives and expanded derivatives and then passed the Banking Reorganization Act earlier this year that allowed the big mega banks that control the regulators to go in and take over your local banks.
[01:35:08.522 --> 01:35:14.507]  And basically feed healthy banks and unhealthy banks into the big mega sex banks.
[01:35:14.507 --> 01:35:16.248]  So it's a vertical integration.
[01:35:16.248 --> 01:35:20.171]  So the answer is the derivatives are accelerating.
[01:35:20.171 --> 01:35:22.833]  All the fraud is accelerating.
[01:35:22.833 --> 01:35:24.715]  And I have French news agency here.
[01:35:24.715 --> 01:35:26.316]  What an incredible announcement.
[01:35:26.316 --> 01:35:31.100]  UN calls for higher taxes to combat climate warning.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:35.243]  And they want the money to be paid into the new IMF World Bank SDR system.
[01:35:37.346 --> 01:35:40.147]  When you get into the fine print of all this, here's another one.
[01:35:40.147 --> 01:35:48.771]  Bloomberg, bank tax, CO2 auctions recommended by Soros panel to help climate efforts.
[01:35:48.771 --> 01:35:59.575]  And it says at least $65 billion to start needs to be raised by taxing foreign exchange transactions, a global VAT financial tax, and auctioning pollution permits.
[01:35:59.575 --> 01:36:02.777]  A United Nations panel said today in a report recommending ways to finance
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:09.361]  Foreign aid and fight global warming had nothing to do with helping the third world.
[01:36:09.361 --> 01:36:16.643]  That's why the third world read the Copenhagen Treaty and said, not just no, but absolutely no.
[01:36:16.643 --> 01:36:19.384]  And George Soros is in the news pushing for that.
[01:36:19.384 --> 01:36:29.307]  And dealing with gold above $1,422 an ounce right now, silver exploding up to $27 an ounce.
[01:36:29.307 --> 01:36:32.308]  It's a law of finance, even in this fraudulent system,
[01:36:34.158 --> 01:36:42.245]  That when they announce they're going to monetize debt and devalue the dollar, that's the end of the currency, if this continues.
[01:36:42.245 --> 01:36:54.835]  And so gold and silver and oil and food and every other commodity is going up, up, up, up, up, up, up, but the globalists have to have the next Ponzi scheme, the next bubble, and that's a completely private, they transcend governments now.
[01:36:54.835 --> 01:36:59.719]  IMF, World Bank, SDR, they've already been testing the last few years, trillions of dollars of it.
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.341]  But now, it's going to be partially gold back.
[01:37:03.341 --> 01:37:05.301]  This is Zoellick's gold standard debate.
[01:37:05.301 --> 01:37:07.322]  The G20 has always been moving towards this.
[01:37:07.322 --> 01:37:08.822]  Right now, they're just introducing it.
[01:37:08.822 --> 01:37:15.464]  It'll be partially gold back, so that every other currency will look worthless compared to it, so you'll want the SDRs.
[01:37:15.464 --> 01:37:18.945]  But they're only digital, so you'll get an SDR card.
[01:37:18.945 --> 01:37:20.305]  And that'll be thumbprint, face scan.
[01:37:20.305 --> 01:37:22.026]  That's where this is going.
[01:37:22.026 --> 01:37:25.367]  This is all their plan, that everything you do is tracked and traced.
[01:37:25.367 --> 01:37:25.687]  In fact,
[01:37:27.096 --> 01:37:31.279]  I wanted to read to you from Revelations 13, 16, 18.
[01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:49.030]  He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.
[01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:50.971]  See, it's a human number.
[01:37:50.971 --> 01:37:52.792]  Let him of understanding reckon its number.
[01:37:54.031 --> 01:37:57.594]  It's a biometric scan of your face, of your hand.
[01:37:57.594 --> 01:38:02.498]  It creates a number from your body.
[01:38:02.498 --> 01:38:04.279]  And this is one of the modern Bible versions.
[01:38:04.279 --> 01:38:05.860]  You guys did a great job printing that for me.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:07.982]  Print me a King James Version of Revelation 13, 16, 18.
[01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:08.903]  That's the really powerful one.
[01:38:14.212 --> 01:38:29.844]  He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or in his forehead so that no one could buy or sell unless he had that mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.
[01:38:29.844 --> 01:38:31.586]  This calls for wisdom.
[01:38:31.586 --> 01:38:35.929]  If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number.
[01:38:35.929 --> 01:38:36.470]  His number is 666.
[01:38:39.727 --> 01:38:41.408]  Let me read the King James Version.
[01:38:41.408 --> 01:39:04.664]  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their forehead, and that no man might buy or sell, save he had that mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
[01:39:04.664 --> 01:39:05.445]  Here is wisdom.
[01:39:06.863 --> 01:39:15.984]  Let he that hath understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and threescore and six.
[01:39:18.444 --> 01:39:19.904]  And I read that Reuters article.
[01:39:19.904 --> 01:39:36.269]  Oh, your medication from Tylenol to you name it's going to have microchips to make sure you're not abusing it and you will swallow it and then all the smart meters in your house, by law, they're moving towards this, your medicine cabinet will be a smart cabinet tracking all that.
[01:39:36.269 --> 01:39:37.129]  This has all been announced.
[01:39:38.154 --> 01:39:54.699]  The federal government, and they're also doing it in England going back five years, offers old people free housing if they live in giant dormitories where their refrigerator tracks everything, there's chips in the pills, they're face scanned, the mirror in their bathroom face scans them.
[01:39:54.699 --> 01:39:56.139]  This is already in place.
[01:39:56.139 --> 01:39:57.960]  So they're beta testing your death grid.
[01:39:59.226 --> 01:40:00.687]  And what does Bill Gates say?
[01:40:00.687 --> 01:40:14.561]  He sits there with that little demonic smile and says, well, you're not supposed to talk about death panels, but if we just don't give a grandmother care, we can hire 10 teachers and all the little teachers in the audience are like, ooh, somebody dies, I get money.
[01:40:14.561 --> 01:40:18.005]  So they play us off against each other, you fools.
[01:40:20.592 --> 01:40:22.973]  Bill Gates, what a wicked devil.
[01:40:22.973 --> 01:40:27.393]  And I get to hear people, you know, at my parents' church, they tell me about it, and it's all over the news.
[01:40:27.393 --> 01:40:30.994]  People walk up, like, you say Bill Gates is bad, but he's helping people.
[01:40:30.994 --> 01:40:32.414]  We've got to get money to him.
[01:40:32.414 --> 01:40:35.235]  Oh, Bill Gatesy!
[01:40:35.235 --> 01:40:38.976]  Planned Parenthood eugenicist.
[01:40:38.976 --> 01:40:45.137]  All right, I want to continue with your calls ahead of our guest, Kristen, Sam, Morris, Patrick, and others.
[01:40:45.137 --> 01:40:48.658]  But getting into the financial news, Fed
[01:40:49.943 --> 01:40:52.865]  Global backlash grows.
[01:40:52.865 --> 01:40:54.106]  And I've got the quotes here.
[01:40:54.106 --> 01:40:54.626]  The U.S.
[01:40:54.626 --> 01:40:58.308]  has lived on borrowed money for too long.
[01:40:58.308 --> 01:40:59.929]  Schauble, is that how you pronounce it?
[01:40:59.929 --> 01:41:00.950]  Wolfgang Schauble?
[01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:01.831]  Schauble?
[01:41:01.831 --> 01:41:08.515]  In an interview with Der Spiegel, the biggest publication in Germany, German finance minister, Schauble, 68, criticizes the U.S.
[01:41:08.515 --> 01:41:19.262]  calls for Germany to reduce exports, outlines its plans for a solvency framework for indebted European nations, and emphasizes the significance of the German-French Axis for Europe.
[01:41:21.055 --> 01:41:25.556]  And he just goes on to say that the United States is completely imploding.
[01:41:25.556 --> 01:41:29.577]  Here is Volcker says no quick way to cut US unemployment.
[01:41:29.577 --> 01:41:32.377]  Yeah, the jobs went away.
[01:41:32.377 --> 01:41:35.358]  Unless you want to be TSA or some kind of goon.
[01:41:35.358 --> 01:41:39.739]  Zoellick seeks gold standard debate ahead of G20.
[01:41:39.739 --> 01:41:47.100]  China tees up G20 showdown with US.
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.941]  Bernanke defends bond purchases, predicts stronger growth.
[01:41:50.759 --> 01:41:53.522]  Yeah, but it's only given to the banks.
[01:41:53.522 --> 01:41:54.623]  Germany attacks U.S.
[01:41:54.623 --> 01:41:57.666]  economic policy, Financial Times.
[01:41:57.666 --> 01:42:00.970]  Obama sidesteps questions on Fed monetary policy.
[01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:02.632]  And everywhere he goes, he has a teleprompter.
[01:42:02.632 --> 01:42:07.377]  I mean, what a joke.
[01:42:07.377 --> 01:42:09.579]  See, the bankers want to bankrupt us.
[01:42:09.579 --> 01:42:11.341]  They're not trying to fix anything.
[01:42:16.041 --> 01:42:21.484]  Now, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up briefly ahead of your calls, because, Ted, this is incredible.
[01:42:21.484 --> 01:42:24.905]  Tell me exactly where is gold and where is silver right now?
[01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:26.046]  Gold hit a high today of $14.2550.
[01:42:26.046 --> 01:42:26.866]  Currently right now at $14.1430.
[01:42:26.866 --> 01:42:27.807]  Silver, oh my God, $29.38.
[01:42:27.807 --> 01:42:29.908]  It's like going up a dollar a day here now.
[01:42:29.908 --> 01:42:31.468]  Currently at $28.34, but a high today of $29.38.
[01:42:43.334 --> 01:42:44.596]  Alex, you're reading all this news.
[01:42:44.596 --> 01:42:47.942]  I had no trouble finding news on gold and silver today.
[01:42:47.942 --> 01:42:49.364]  Sometimes it's tough.
[01:42:49.364 --> 01:42:51.968]  But the Europeans are falling apart, too, right now.
[01:42:51.968 --> 01:42:54.992]  They have way too much debt, just like the United States has.
[01:42:56.823 --> 01:42:58.704]  Excuse me.
[01:42:58.704 --> 01:43:02.527]  And so now we're seeing European countries falling apart, too.
[01:43:02.527 --> 01:43:04.968]  So it's like this big race to the bottom.
[01:43:04.968 --> 01:43:07.430]  And the United States is, I think, in the lead.
[01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:10.512]  But, you know, the gold, I mean, come on.
[01:43:10.512 --> 01:43:11.492]  Silver at $29.38.
[01:43:11.492 --> 01:43:12.373]  We're going to hit that $50 an ounce.
[01:43:16.355 --> 01:43:19.719]  Gold right now has a resistance level of $1,450.
[01:43:19.719 --> 01:43:24.145]  That's where we start to see resistance in the gold price.
[01:43:24.145 --> 01:43:27.028]  We blew through $1,400 like there was nothing there.
[01:43:27.028 --> 01:43:35.018]  And silver, I mean, just about a week ago we were wondering whether silver was going to go from $24 to $25 an ounce, and now it's just 50 cents short of $30.
[01:43:35.979 --> 01:43:36.920]  I mean, my goodness.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:43.223]  I mean, Alex, if people haven't woken up by this point, especially on that video offer, I'm scratching my head.
[01:43:43.223 --> 01:43:51.648]  Silver dollars, Alex, are over $30 apiece now, and we're delivering three of those silver dollars and your videos right now for $89.
[01:43:51.648 --> 01:43:55.850]  And, you know, that doesn't even cover the postage.
[01:43:55.850 --> 01:43:57.751]  I mean, it's a complete loss leader.
[01:43:57.751 --> 01:43:59.472]  It's $160 value, shippings included.
[01:44:02.574 --> 01:44:09.438]  For $89, and you're gonna have to go up soon on that, Ted, because you're running out of the silver you bought at the lower price.
[01:44:09.438 --> 01:44:19.864]  Three silver dollars, three of my most powerful films in the hardcover DVD case to give as gifts or to watch yourself, and shipping for $89.
[01:44:19.864 --> 01:44:20.204]  That is...
[01:44:23.186 --> 01:44:23.526]  Let me see.
[01:44:43.156 --> 01:44:46.418]  The main thing is... How long until you run out of those silver dollars that you bought back at $23?
[01:44:46.418 --> 01:44:48.740]  Well, that's the problem right now.
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:51.121]  I'm running right on the edge of that right now.
[01:44:51.121 --> 01:44:58.006]  Well, it's still going to be a great deal when you're charging $100 for three silver dollars and the three films and free shipping.
[01:44:58.006 --> 01:44:59.787]  But folks, I would take advantage of this now.
[01:44:59.787 --> 01:45:00.928]  I was talking to Ted this morning.
[01:45:01.668 --> 01:45:06.776]  Uh, the films are flying off the shelf and the silver dollars are running out at the earlier price he bought them.
[01:45:06.776 --> 01:45:08.198]  He's already losing money on this.
[01:45:08.198 --> 01:45:09.540]  He can't lose more.
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.563]  If this continues, he's gonna have to go up 800-686-2237.
[01:45:11.563 --> 01:45:16.671]  You're not only getting an unbelievable all-time best deal...
[01:45:17.492 --> 01:45:20.015]  There's really no profit, so I guess in a way it doesn't support the network.
[01:45:20.015 --> 01:45:21.898]  But, you know, this is Genesis.
[01:45:21.898 --> 01:45:24.080]  This is Midas Resources, the parent company.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.244]  We've been in this since, you know, gold was 250 bucks an ounce.
[01:45:27.244 --> 01:45:30.208]  Telling you they're devaluing the dollar, you know, 12, 13 years ago.
[01:45:30.208 --> 01:45:31.730]  You better get into gold and silver now.
[01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:33.792]  If you would have listened to us, where would you be?
[01:45:33.792 --> 01:45:35.935]  People said, oh, a thousand bucks six months ago.
[01:45:36.716 --> 01:45:38.437]  You know, I can't get into gold, it's too much.
[01:45:38.437 --> 01:45:42.800]  Well, does $1,000 look like too much now with it at $1,420-something an ounce?
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:46.181]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to get involved today.
[01:45:46.181 --> 01:45:49.904]  But folks, some people, you know, Ted, don't just want three silver dollars.
[01:45:49.904 --> 01:45:54.866]  Some people just don't want one franc and a free international forecaster, a year subscription, that's an incredible deal.
[01:45:54.866 --> 01:45:55.387]  Some people...
[01:45:56.337 --> 01:46:01.300]  First of all, Alex, people have to really take a serious look at their portfolios right now.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:10.367]  I mean, if you're in the stock market, if you have bonds, if you have cash in the bank, if you're invested in annuities, I mean, you've got to remember, annuities aren't even guaranteed or insured.
[01:46:24.016 --> 01:46:24.296]  I think?
[01:46:41.118 --> 01:47:03.470]  The dollar is in a free fall right now, and gold and silver is reflecting it, and if you haven't seriously taken a look at what you're doing with your money that you're saving for cash flow for your business, if you have money invested in the stock market, the banks, or wherever it is, right now you better be considering gold and silver, because cash is like produce at the grocery store.
[01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:08.833]  It is losing purchasing power, and it has an expiration date coming to us.
[01:47:09.773 --> 01:47:13.295]  Chad, to be specific here, I'm not tooting our horn.
[01:47:13.295 --> 01:47:20.078]  I'm not happy that we're totally 100% right on this, that we predicted the global SDR that we, decades ago.
[01:47:21.090 --> 01:47:30.456]  Uh, that we laid out how they'd devalue it, how they'd have a currency war, and then offer this new global cashless system, partially gold-backed, as the solution.
[01:47:30.456 --> 01:47:39.781]  Once they've hoarded all the gold, which they've been buying with their fake paper, hoarding it, all the elites, all the wealthy, all the insiders, then they're gonna put us on a partial gold standard.
[01:47:39.781 --> 01:47:41.302]  It might even be five years down the road.
[01:47:41.302 --> 01:47:45.404]  The point is, then gold might be 10,000 an ounce in SDRs.
[01:47:45.404 --> 01:47:49.947]  They're killing all the currencies to force us on this new global currency, and gold
[01:47:50.367 --> 01:48:00.091]  You know, it goes up to 1,000, goes to 900, goes to 1,200, goes to 1,100, goes to, you know, 1,300, goes back down to 1,000, goes to 14, might go back down to 13.
[01:48:00.091 --> 01:48:11.735]  I doubt it, because they have signified and announced what they're doing, and they're telling us inflation, you know, New York Times headline, inflation, Bernanke says, is the answer to our problems.
[01:48:12.355 --> 01:48:19.399]  That's like if you've got one leg chopped off, chopping the other off, or if you've got one bullet wound in your chest, shooting yourself in the head.
[01:48:19.399 --> 01:48:22.920]  They're like, we're going to shoot ourselves in the head, and that's going to help us.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:26.702]  Well, it's going to help the big mega banks making record bonuses, record profits.
[01:48:26.702 --> 01:48:28.963]  This is financial global war.
[01:48:28.963 --> 01:48:32.125]  When Hitler took over Poland, he had to blow up a lot of stuff.
[01:48:32.665 --> 01:48:36.286]  You know, when the Soviets took over Eastern Europe, they had to destroy a lot of stuff.
[01:48:36.286 --> 01:48:40.107]  They are destroying things to consolidate it and be on top of it.
[01:48:40.107 --> 01:48:43.347]  I heard a talk show host this morning saying the elite don't care if they devalue the dollar.
[01:48:43.347 --> 01:48:44.948]  It's not that they don't care.
[01:48:44.948 --> 01:48:46.348]  This is a weapon.
[01:48:46.348 --> 01:48:50.309]  We've got the Trilateral Commission, CFR, UN reports.
[01:48:50.309 --> 01:48:52.029]  We knew exactly what they do.
[01:48:52.029 --> 01:48:55.430]  We told you and read the documents on air.
[01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:57.970]  I've been on air 15 years.
[01:48:57.970 --> 01:49:00.971]  You know, the Trilateral Commission reported all this, that they were planning it.
[01:49:03.343 --> 01:49:08.246]  1975 was... How many years ago was 1975, Ted?
[01:49:08.246 --> 01:49:08.726]  35 years ago?
[01:49:08.726 --> 01:49:12.909]  I mean, they told us and we're living it!
[01:49:12.909 --> 01:49:15.951]  It's not prophecy, they told us their plan!
[01:49:15.951 --> 01:49:21.755]  I mean, Helmut Schmidt wrote Men and Powers, he was the German Chancellor, he admitted one world government!
[01:49:21.755 --> 01:49:23.296]  Total tyranny is their plan!
[01:49:23.296 --> 01:49:24.117]  They write books!
[01:49:24.457 --> 01:49:27.219]  David Rockefeller four years ago wrote his memoir.
[01:49:27.219 --> 01:49:27.919]  In fact, pull it up.
[01:49:27.919 --> 01:49:31.081]  David Rockefeller memoir, I forget the name of it, admits global government.
[01:49:31.081 --> 01:49:32.783]  It's page 442, I believe.
[01:49:32.783 --> 01:49:33.783]  You can just pull it up.
[01:49:33.783 --> 01:49:34.804]  The screenshot's online.
[01:49:34.804 --> 01:49:37.566]  Just David Rockefeller admits in his book he wants world government.
[01:49:37.566 --> 01:49:39.567]  And he said, people accuse me of wanting to get rid of the U.S.
[01:49:39.567 --> 01:49:41.468]  sovereignty and set up a one world government.
[01:49:41.468 --> 01:49:43.009]  Well, I say guilty.
[01:49:43.009 --> 01:49:44.530]  Guilty as charged.
[01:49:44.530 --> 01:49:49.153]  And you've got all these childlike people told by the neocons for decades that none of this existed.
[01:49:49.153 --> 01:49:50.334]  Now it's here.
[01:49:50.334 --> 01:49:51.195]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:49:52.217 --> 01:49:52.457]  I think?
[01:50:13.215 --> 01:50:21.397]  But I think you should call right now the globalists hate it that we know what's going on, that patriots are getting food, getting water, getting guns, getting gold.
[01:50:21.397 --> 01:50:24.698]  They can't stand it that the remnant knows what's going on.
[01:50:24.698 --> 01:50:31.120]  And notice because we knew we're in the power position now, not just with resources, but with moral credibility.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:32.200]  We're rising.
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:34.361]  The globalists are being totally discredited.
[01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:35.361]  Here's the number.
[01:50:35.361 --> 01:50:36.521]  The brokers are there right now.
[01:50:36.521 --> 01:50:37.902]  They're up there till midnight every night.
[01:50:37.902 --> 01:50:38.002]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:38.002 --> 01:50:38.602]  Write that number down.
[01:50:44.083 --> 01:50:45.624]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:45.624 --> 01:50:49.905]  Take action, don't procrastinate.
[01:50:49.905 --> 01:50:53.585]  I know I haven't been buying a lot of gold and silver because it's so high, but I'm going to stop procrastinating.
[01:50:53.585 --> 01:50:54.165]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:54.165 --> 01:51:01.747]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:51:01.747 --> 01:51:06.468]  Rock Creek gently flows through the parkland of Washington, D.C.
[01:51:06.468 --> 01:51:10.749]  until it meets the mighty Potomac River in the heart of the federal city.
[01:51:13.135 --> 01:51:19.938]  On the other hand, Rock Creek Free Press is a fiercely independent newspaper that's not afraid to print the truth.
[01:51:19.938 --> 01:51:22.519]  We print the stories that others won't touch.
[01:51:22.519 --> 01:51:31.403]  The 9-11 cover-up, media propaganda, government corruption, state terrorism, and violations of our constitutional rights.
[01:51:31.403 --> 01:51:34.604]  The Creek is a completely reader-supported publication.

[01:51:53.271 --> 01:51:55.151]  Rock Creek Free Press.
[01:51:55.151 --> 01:51:57.192]  Not afraid to print the truth.
[01:51:57.192 --> 01:51:57.812]  Call them at 301-452-0090 today.
[01:52:01.013 --> 01:52:02.315]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.315 --> 01:52:07.903]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.903 --> 01:52:12.930]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.930 --> 01:52:13.390]  It's true.
[01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:17.957]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.477 --> 01:52:23.701]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.701 --> 01:52:30.827]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.827 --> 01:52:31.948]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.948 --> 01:52:38.293]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.613 --> 01:52:41.815]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.815 --> 01:52:44.036]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:44.036 --> 01:52:44.976]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.976 --> 01:52:45.376]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.376 --> 01:52:48.618]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:48.618 --> 01:52:50.339]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:01.135 --> 01:53:03.236]  Do you have pain from a soft tissue injury?
[01:53:03.236 --> 01:53:05.897]  Would you like to alleviate that pain in 10 minutes?
[01:53:05.897 --> 01:53:11.218]  Science has now figured out how to put healing sound frequencies into a kaolin clay and polymer gel.
[01:53:11.218 --> 01:53:18.581]  Once applied to the area of pain, frequency signals are transmitted to the area of injury that activates the release of prostaglandin hormones.
[01:53:18.581 --> 01:53:23.663]  Your body's own prostaglandin hormones eliminate inflammation and the pain that it is causing.
[01:53:23.663 --> 01:53:27.804]  The result is the elimination of pain in 10 minutes for 90% of users.
[01:53:27.804 --> 01:53:30.485]  We have thermography pictures to prove its effectiveness.
[01:53:30.865 --> 01:53:40.729]  The only alternatives on the market are topical cooling agents that for many are poor performers, often smell bad, may be oily, and do not activate the body's innate response system.
[01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:47.311]  If you'd like a superior alternative to alleviating soft tissue trauma pain in as little as 10 minutes, please call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:47.311 --> 01:53:47.511]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:47.511 --> 01:53:48.771]  Or visit KnockoutPainCream.com.
[01:53:48.771 --> 01:53:49.532]  That's KnockoutPainCream.com.
[01:54:06.903 --> 01:54:10.225]  Alright, we're going to take your calls on the TSA and the economy in this segment and the next.
[01:54:10.225 --> 01:54:16.868]  Then we have a top toxicologist coming in to talk about, in studio, about what fluoride does.
[01:54:16.868 --> 01:54:19.029]  Here's one more TSA piece of news.
[01:54:19.029 --> 01:54:22.811]  Indian minister asked Obama to end turbine frisking.
[01:54:22.811 --> 01:54:30.996]  The Indian lawmaker from Punjab said yesterday, or today, that she had asked President Obama to put a stop to U.S.
[01:54:31.576 --> 01:54:34.438]  Border practice of frisking Sikh turbans.
[01:54:34.438 --> 01:54:36.019]  And you've seen the Sikhs.
[01:54:36.019 --> 01:54:37.540]  They're not Muslims, folks.
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:39.101]  Not that Muslims are bad either.
[01:54:39.101 --> 01:54:44.625]  But these poor people have been killed at gas stations, killed at apartment complexes, murdered over and over again.
[01:54:44.625 --> 01:54:49.429]  In fact, the Sikhs actually have a lot of run-ins with Muslims because they have a lot of fights in India.
[01:54:50.732 --> 01:54:56.835]  And they get beat up, you name it, and idiots think that their turban means they're with Osama Bin Laden.
[01:54:56.835 --> 01:55:03.157]  They have long hair as part of their religion, and nobody except for their wife or their family is supposed to see it.
[01:55:03.157 --> 01:55:09.560]  And they pull the turban off at the airport, they run their hands through their hair, and that's why terrorism's down over a third.
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.961]  I mean, people are just not coming here.
[01:55:11.961 --> 01:55:14.262]  Another thing killing our economy.
[01:55:14.262 --> 01:55:15.803]  People are like, well, they could have a bomb in there.
[01:55:15.803 --> 01:55:17.904]  I mean, give me a break, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:18.894 --> 01:55:23.297]  Okay, every time there's a terrorist, the government's ordered to let them in.
[01:55:23.297 --> 01:55:33.443]  In the case of 9-11, in the case of Anwar al-Awlaki, the few Muslim extremists that are out there, that are outside of Palestine, there are some real folks there blowing themselves up, it's staged.
[01:55:33.443 --> 01:55:34.944]  It's staged.
[01:55:34.944 --> 01:55:36.245]  And, you know, it's just that simple.
[01:55:36.245 --> 01:55:39.087]  But I said I'd go to your calls, let's go to them.
[01:55:39.087 --> 01:55:40.027]  Who's up next here, John?
[01:55:40.027 --> 01:55:42.389]  Tim?
[01:55:42.389 --> 01:55:44.250]  I already talked to Tim.
[01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:45.111]  I don't remember.
[01:55:45.111 --> 01:55:46.311]  Tim, Tim, why did I hold you over?
[01:55:46.311 --> 01:55:47.112]  Do you have something else to add?
[01:55:48.292 --> 01:55:53.455]  Yes sir, I was curious about the state of possibly bringing back the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:55:53.455 --> 01:55:54.495]  Oh yeah, I did answer that.
[01:55:54.495 --> 01:55:56.496]  I did answer that.
[01:55:56.496 --> 01:56:01.359]  They didn't just not get rid of it, they allowed even more.
[01:56:01.359 --> 01:56:02.499]  I appreciate your call, Tim.
[01:56:02.499 --> 01:56:03.260]  It's terrible news.
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:04.360]  Kristen in Colorado.
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:08.562]  Kristen, you're on the air.
[01:56:08.562 --> 01:56:09.263]  Go ahead, Kristen.
[01:56:09.263 --> 01:56:09.543]  Welcome.
[01:56:09.543 --> 01:56:10.583]  What happened to you with the TSA?
[01:56:10.583 --> 01:56:11.484]  Are you calling about something else?
[01:56:12.114 --> 01:56:18.277]  Hi, actually I'm calling about something else, but first of all I just want to tell you thank you so much for your passion and your dedication.
[01:56:18.277 --> 01:56:20.258]  It really means a lot to all of us.
[01:56:20.258 --> 01:56:21.659]  Thank you.
[01:56:21.659 --> 01:56:28.202]  I wanted to know if you had heard anything about this mysterious missile that was launched off the Southern California coast.
[01:56:29.989 --> 01:56:35.433]  Well, I'm not going to talk about it because my enemies will take it and edit it and say a missile was never fired and I made it up.
[01:56:35.433 --> 01:56:40.377]  Like what happened with the Russians when they fired one and ABC News reported it ten years ago.
[01:56:40.377 --> 01:56:42.558]  But yeah, it's the top story on Drudge Report.
[01:56:42.558 --> 01:56:45.401]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:56:45.401 --> 01:56:48.463]  It's clearly a big military test, but they won't say.
[01:56:48.463 --> 01:56:49.584]  All part of their fear-mongering.
[01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:53.271]  Okay, well, I just wanted to know what your thoughts were about that.
[01:56:53.271 --> 01:57:02.198]  I found it kind of strange and, and, um, you know, I question everything, so... Kristen, it's very bizarre and you can watch video of it up at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:02.198 --> 01:57:03.820]  The Drudge Report also has it.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:04.921]  Thank you, Kristen.
[01:57:04.921 --> 01:57:05.921]  Uh, Sam in Vegas.
[01:57:05.921 --> 01:57:08.283]  Sam, you're on the air.
[01:57:08.283 --> 01:57:08.784]  Hello?
[01:57:08.784 --> 01:57:10.505]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:57:10.505 --> 01:57:11.766]  Uh, hi, Alex.
[01:57:11.766 --> 01:57:14.248]  Uh, hey, I love your rants.
[01:57:14.248 --> 01:57:16.871]  Uh, it's about time Americans start getting angry.
[01:57:16.871 --> 01:57:19.453]  But anyway, um, my wife is Chinese.
[01:57:19.983 --> 01:57:23.352]  And I've flown to China probably four times since 9-11 and
[01:57:26.119 --> 01:57:27.380]  It's unbelievable.
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:34.143]  I think the problem is most Americans never go anywhere to see what, you know, to compare things.
[01:57:34.143 --> 01:57:39.745]  Well, Americans of any industrialized nation have the lowest amount of passports.
[01:57:39.745 --> 01:57:41.106]  They don't travel.
[01:57:41.106 --> 01:57:51.750]  And so they think that this is, they think land of the free, home of the brave, you drink fluoride, you drink bisphenol A, you know, you die of cancer early and you get your breast squeezed.
[01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:53.631]  It's freedom.
[01:57:53.631 --> 01:57:55.252]  But anyway, Alex, I,
[01:57:56.424 --> 01:58:00.826]  Since 9-11, I flew into Guangzhou, China.
[01:58:00.826 --> 01:58:10.089]  You get off the plane, you walk up to a little desk, you show them your passport, and that's it.
[01:58:10.089 --> 01:58:15.471]  They put the information in the computer, you walk out the door, get in a taxi and go.
[01:58:15.471 --> 01:58:17.792]  Now flying back into LAX,
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:21.821]  I mean, I'm in a line with a lot of Asians.
[01:58:21.821 --> 01:58:25.863]  I'm the only blonde-haired, blue-eyed person in the line.
[01:58:25.863 --> 01:58:27.264]  Here comes the TSA guy.
[01:58:27.264 --> 01:58:28.444]  You, over here.
[01:58:28.444 --> 01:58:31.866]  No, no, no, because they've got a mandate to train who they think are citizens.
[01:58:31.866 --> 01:58:36.308]  Illegal aliens are allowed to go rent any aircraft they want by the TSA.
[01:58:36.308 --> 01:58:36.668]  Stay there.
[01:58:36.668 --> 01:58:37.788]  I want you to finish up your story.
[01:58:37.788 --> 01:58:38.489]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:44.929 --> 01:58:48.915]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:51.195 --> 01:58:55.377]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:55.377 --> 01:59:01.780]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:09.183]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:09.183 --> 01:59:14.046]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:59:14.046 --> 01:59:16.187]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:59:18.988 --> 01:59:22.714]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:59:22.714 --> 01:59:26.441]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:59:26.963 --> 01:59:33.747]  As powder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:59:33.747 --> 01:59:37.629]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:59:37.629 --> 01:59:43.993]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:59:43.993 --> 01:59:44.774]  Thank you.
[01:59:54.133 --> 01:59:56.535]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.535 --> 02:00:06.022]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.022 --> 02:00:07.343]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.343 --> 02:00:09.104]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.104 --> 02:00:10.865]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.865 --> 02:00:12.446]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.446 --> 02:00:13.367]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.367 --> 02:00:18.190]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.190 --> 02:00:22.273]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.314 --> 02:00:25.937]  We are into hour number three.
[02:00:25.937 --> 02:00:30.262]  I will continue this week to have another hour open just for victims of TSA.
[02:00:30.262 --> 02:00:42.516]  I'm going to probably have to wipe the phone calls after this segment because we're just going to be talking about toxins in the environment with a leading top toxicologist, PhD, the head of the Fluoride Action Network.
[02:00:43.373 --> 02:00:43.533]  There's
[02:00:58.888 --> 02:01:02.189]  And I've seen this in Canada and coming back into the U.S.
[02:01:02.189 --> 02:01:07.250]  If you are Chinese or you are Hispanic, even if you're a citizen, you're left alone most of the time.
[02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:09.790]  If you're Anglo or black, get ready.
[02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:12.171]  Because they figure this is a citizen, then they check.
[02:01:12.171 --> 02:01:13.931]  And they harass you.
[02:01:13.931 --> 02:01:16.411]  Because this is submission training.
[02:01:16.411 --> 02:01:19.172]  Now the idiot TSA people, they don't know that.
[02:01:19.172 --> 02:01:21.872]  They just, we're told to search enough of the women today.
[02:01:21.872 --> 02:01:24.053]  We're told to lift their dresses up and yell at them.
[02:01:25.453 --> 02:01:26.573]  We don't know why, but we are.
[02:01:26.573 --> 02:01:27.614]  It's to intimidate them.
[02:01:27.614 --> 02:01:39.917]  So you're saying you come in all the time from China, because your wife's Chinese, and Sam, for those that just joined us, and that because you're the white guy, boy, they hone in on you because you may be al-Qaeda.
[02:01:39.917 --> 02:01:41.917]  Tell us about that.
[02:01:41.917 --> 02:01:50.800]  Okay, so I'm walking down the line, and you get to the gate, and a TSA guy is standing there.
[02:01:52.412 --> 02:01:54.353]  And they'll just kind of like pull you out of the line.
[02:01:54.353 --> 02:01:55.994]  Well, everybody's aware of that.
[02:01:55.994 --> 02:02:01.097]  So they pull me out of the line, take me around to the side to where the tables are.
[02:02:01.097 --> 02:02:03.279]  Put your bags on the table.
[02:02:03.279 --> 02:02:05.740]  They're opening my bags, going through the bags.
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:09.002]  Now Marlboros are like 40 cents a pack in China.
[02:02:09.002 --> 02:02:11.844]  So I've got four cartons of Marlboros.
[02:02:11.844 --> 02:02:13.565]  Why do you have all these cigarettes?
[02:02:13.565 --> 02:02:18.708]  What was your business in China?
[02:02:18.708 --> 02:02:20.269]  I go, well, I went to visit my in-laws.
[02:02:20.269 --> 02:02:21.230]  Do you have photos of...
[02:02:22.102 --> 02:02:25.865]  Finally, it got to the point, Alex, I'm a smoker and I'm dying for a smoke.
[02:02:25.865 --> 02:02:27.806]  You know how we are.
[02:02:27.806 --> 02:02:33.571]  I got fed up with this, this guy that comes about up to my chin, giving me all these questions.
[02:02:33.571 --> 02:02:34.771]  What is my business?
[02:02:34.771 --> 02:02:35.712]  Why was I there?
[02:02:35.712 --> 02:02:38.014]  What am I, you know?
[02:02:38.014 --> 02:02:42.777]  Finally, I just tell, I just can't take it anymore.
[02:02:42.777 --> 02:02:48.502]  I say, I say to the guy, I say, Hey, look, you little twerp.
[02:02:48.502 --> 02:02:50.143]  I just left China.
[02:02:50.143 --> 02:02:51.504]  I get off the plane in China.
[02:02:52.276 --> 02:02:54.757]  I walk out the door and get in the taxi.
[02:02:54.757 --> 02:02:57.738]  I'm in the land of the free.
[02:02:57.738 --> 02:03:03.320]  You're giving me all these questions, going through my bags, wanting to know what my business is.
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:04.301]  And what did the God say?
[02:03:08.132 --> 02:03:10.594]  Finally, he saw that I wasn't afraid of him.
[02:03:10.594 --> 02:03:11.815]  I mean, I'm doing nothing wrong.
[02:03:11.815 --> 02:03:12.615]  Well, let's be honest.
[02:03:12.615 --> 02:03:14.176]  They were looking for drugs.
[02:03:14.176 --> 02:03:17.559]  But the issue is, the government grows most of the drugs on record.
[02:03:17.559 --> 02:03:20.220]  They're trying to catch people cutting in on their cash.
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:22.922]  And that's when cops have wanted to search my car before I go.
[02:03:22.922 --> 02:03:24.423]  I don't use illegal drugs.
[02:03:24.423 --> 02:03:27.065]  I don't use the products that your bosses produce.
[02:03:27.065 --> 02:03:27.645]  So don't worry.
[02:03:27.645 --> 02:03:29.066]  I'm not cutting in on it.
[02:03:29.066 --> 02:03:32.008]  And you're not going to put me in your little private prison to make some money.
[02:03:32.008 --> 02:03:35.331]  Most of the private prisons on record are owned by big banks that launder drug money.
[02:03:36.091 --> 02:03:38.353]  And so look, I don't use your stinking products.
[02:03:38.353 --> 02:03:40.134]  Get it through your head.
[02:03:40.134 --> 02:03:41.195]  Okay?
[02:03:41.195 --> 02:03:44.858]  And I try to stay away from the other stuff that's legal, like tobacco and jam bean.
[02:03:44.858 --> 02:03:46.319]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:46.319 --> 02:03:47.340]  Good to hear from you, Sam.
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:48.721]  Let's jam in one more.
[02:03:48.721 --> 02:03:50.283]  Mortis in Connecticut.
[02:03:50.283 --> 02:03:51.864]  Mortis, you're on the air.
[02:03:51.864 --> 02:03:52.765]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:03:52.765 --> 02:03:53.785]  It's great to talk to you.
[02:03:53.785 --> 02:03:58.249]  This is Mortis Noctu, revolutionary rapper slash patriot.
[02:03:58.249 --> 02:04:00.551]  I basically just wanted to call in and say that
[02:04:01.425 --> 02:04:08.467]  Anybody who has been watching the gold price or checked the history of gold and silver should know that the prices are going to keep going up.
[02:04:08.467 --> 02:04:12.867]  There's been 97 years of straight devaluation, and it's going to continue.
[02:04:12.867 --> 02:04:17.929]  Yeah, they've been devaluing the dollar, suppressing gold, but they can't do it anymore.
[02:04:17.929 --> 02:04:18.989]  Exactly.
[02:04:18.989 --> 02:04:20.609]  Gold is about to jump.
[02:04:20.609 --> 02:04:24.390]  Anybody who thinks differently has no idea, and they haven't been paying any attention.
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:35.708]  And, um, other than that, I basically wanted to say that I've been working on an album using Pink Floyd beats, talking about revolutionary topics, and I think that you and your audience would really enjoy it.
[02:04:35.708 --> 02:04:42.173]  It's Mortis Noctu, M-O-R-T-I-S-N-O-C-T-U at YouTube.com.
[02:04:42.173 --> 02:04:44.655]  Well done, Mortis!
[02:04:44.655 --> 02:04:45.856]  What does Mortis have to do with death?
[02:04:45.856 --> 02:04:48.818]  It means death by night in Latin.
[02:04:48.818 --> 02:04:49.919]  Yeah, Nosferatu.
[02:04:51.852 --> 02:04:52.876]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:04:52.876 --> 02:04:54.220]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:56.828]  We've got an amazing author joining us.
[02:04:56.828 --> 02:04:57.931]  He's also a scientist.

[02:06:01.115 --> 02:06:04.698]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:06:04.698 --> 02:06:06.000]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.404]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:06:10.404 --> 02:06:16.349]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:06:16.349 --> 02:06:18.491]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:06:18.491 --> 02:06:21.174]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.

[02:08:10.999 --> 02:08:12.581]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.581 --> 02:08:14.122]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.122 --> 02:08:18.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.326 --> 02:08:22.389]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:28.112]  We have Dr. Paul Conant in studio with us.
[02:08:28.112 --> 02:08:30.412]  He might have been going to overdrive a little.
[02:08:30.412 --> 02:08:32.113]  No, he did that yesterday.
[02:08:32.113 --> 02:08:33.593]  But it's great to have him in person.
[02:08:33.593 --> 02:08:37.155]  We're going to be talking to him in just a moment.
[02:08:37.155 --> 02:08:40.316]  You've noticed if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member,
[02:08:41.116 --> 02:08:44.058]  For radio listeners, it's 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[02:08:44.058 --> 02:08:47.160]  It funds most of our bandwidth and a lot of our operation.
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:58.108]  You get all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, expanded extras from the films, behind the scenes, the live video streams of the radio show, archived, a higher quality podcast, commercial free.
[02:08:58.108 --> 02:09:02.751]  But we're also taking the hundreds of interviews, hundreds and hundreds.
[02:09:02.751 --> 02:09:06.954]  I've done over 40 plus with my guys flying around the country that have never before been seen.
[02:09:07.839 --> 02:09:10.520]  And we're posting them on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:20.965]  Posted a never-before-seen Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura interview this week, Dr. Russell Blaylock, brain surgeon about the chemicals in the food and water, the bisphenol, the rest of it.
[02:09:20.965 --> 02:09:22.806]  That's going up in a few days.
[02:09:22.806 --> 02:09:30.549]  But we've got a never-before-seen Rand Paul interview that just went live a few minutes ago at GCNLive.com.
[02:09:30.549 --> 02:09:34.151]  There's an article about it and links over to PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:45.487]  And it's Rand Paul, ThoughtCrimeUSA, never-before-seen interview, new Kentucky Senator, warns of Obama administration exploiting crisis to ram through a big government agenda.
[02:09:45.487 --> 02:09:52.353]  And I'll just tell you, the media was running ads, nationally and locally, about how dare him come on extremist Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:52.353 --> 02:09:56.677]  And I had the interview, we done it here in Austin, and I said, you know, I'm gonna wait till he wins.
[02:09:56.677 --> 02:10:00.239]  I'm not gonna ask him to come on anymore, he's scheduled this week or next week, we're not sure.
[02:10:00.239 --> 02:10:03.122]  He'll be a Senator for six years, it won't be an issue, I'm gonna get him on.
[02:10:03.562 --> 02:10:05.565]  I'm going to air this interview later.
[02:10:05.565 --> 02:10:09.391]  Well, now it's at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:10:09.391 --> 02:10:10.452]  There's never before seen interview.
[02:10:10.452 --> 02:10:15.620]  New Kentucky Senator, Orrins of Obama Administration, exploiting crisis to ram through a big government agenda.
[02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:17.923]  Powerful interview up there at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:10:17.923 --> 02:10:18.924]  Takes about a minute to sign up.
[02:10:19.505 --> 02:10:19.785]  I don't know.
[02:10:40.583 --> 02:10:43.727]  Also, TSA rejects airport molestation complaints.
[02:10:43.727 --> 02:10:45.489]  That's at GCNLive.com.
[02:10:45.489 --> 02:10:49.313]  Gold sets new record as QE2 devaluates fiat currencies.
[02:10:49.313 --> 02:10:51.976]  Also at GCNLive.com by Kurt Nemo.
[02:10:51.976 --> 02:10:55.740]  Another story here, drone surveillance program targeting Americans.
[02:10:55.740 --> 02:10:59.405]  That's at GCNLive.com right now.
[02:11:02.182 --> 02:11:06.666]  I want to be clear as we introduce our guest today here in studio.
[02:11:06.666 --> 02:11:13.192]  Back in 2000, they testified before Congress, other scientists and environmental researchers, toxicologists.
[02:11:13.192 --> 02:11:14.974]  I've interviewed some of those folks.
[02:11:14.974 --> 02:11:19.478]  The vast majority, I think it was over 90% of their toxicologists at the EPA.
[02:11:21.139 --> 02:11:27.721]  Also, the FDA has signed to send letters, the vast majority shed sodium fluoride's deadly poisonous increases cancer.
[02:11:27.721 --> 02:11:33.402]  So it's not like there's just a few medical doctors or scientists or toxicologists saying this.
[02:11:33.402 --> 02:11:34.763]  This is the vast bulk.
[02:11:34.763 --> 02:11:43.425]  And Dr. Conin, who's always up on the latest info, he can correct all my numbers and go over it, but he has the new book out, The Case Against Fluoride, a new
[02:11:44.765 --> 02:11:52.328]  Look at the scientific evidence, how hazardous waste ended up in our drinking water, and the bad science and powerful politics that kept it there.
[02:11:52.328 --> 02:12:04.913]  Paul Conant, Ph.D., James Beck, M.D., medical doctor and Ph.D., and others that wrote this book, and it's got a nice bibliography for you to check out all the facts.
[02:12:04.913 --> 02:12:10.775]  This is the real science, and we're going to discuss this, because even if you filter your water, you're bathing in it.
[02:12:11.275 --> 02:12:16.682]  Or it's being sprayed now as a pesticide on the foods, on the crops, and then it bioaccumulates.
[02:12:16.682 --> 02:12:20.587]  But instead of Alex Jones talking about this, we go to Dr. Paul Conant.
[02:12:20.587 --> 02:12:29.478]  He is the Director of the Fluoride Action Network, FAN, FluorideAlert.org, and the Executive Director of its parent body, the American Environmental Health Studies Project.
[02:12:29.918 --> 02:12:36.699]  He has spoken and given more than 2,000 presentations in 49 states and 52 countries on the issue of waste management.
[02:12:36.699 --> 02:12:44.621]  He holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in chemistry at Dartmouth College and is a retired professor of environmental chemistry and toxicology at St.
[02:12:44.621 --> 02:12:45.781]  Lawrence University.
[02:12:45.781 --> 02:12:47.342]  He lives in Canton, New York.
[02:12:47.342 --> 02:12:48.962]  Again, fluoridealert.org.
[02:12:48.962 --> 02:12:51.663]  Congratulations on your book and your tireless efforts, sir.
[02:12:51.663 --> 02:12:53.243]  Thank you, Alex, very much indeed.
[02:12:53.803 --> 02:12:54.884]  So, you've got the floor.
[02:12:54.884 --> 02:12:58.105]  Tell us about your awakening, the basic science.
[02:12:58.105 --> 02:13:01.806]  Go over the fact that most of the, even government scientists are saying, get this out.
[02:13:01.806 --> 02:13:13.071]  They've approached the government, but still these interests lobby millions of dollars, even in small towns, to get it in the food, get it in the water, to give the kids the fluoride pills, the toothpaste.
[02:13:13.071 --> 02:13:14.512]  I mean, they are just pushing this.
[02:13:15.072 --> 02:13:15.972]  Absolutely.
[02:13:15.972 --> 02:13:30.718]  Well, if people go to our webpage, they'll find over 3,000 professionals, dentists, doctors, nurses, all kinds of professionals involved in health, environment and so on, have signed a statement calling for an end to fluoridation worldwide.
[02:13:31.298 --> 02:13:45.047]  So, I've been researching this for 14 years, and I didn't want the issue because 14 years ago I was very busy teaching chemistry and working on the waste management that you just talked about, and that was taking up most of my weekends and holidays.
[02:13:45.047 --> 02:13:50.611]  But my wife put down this bunch of papers on my desk and said, dear, would you read these?
[02:13:50.611 --> 02:13:51.632]  I said, what is it?
[02:13:51.632 --> 02:13:53.073]  She said, fluoridation.
[02:13:53.073 --> 02:13:55.394]  I said, take that away, these people are crazy.
[02:13:55.394 --> 02:13:56.455]  Yeah, Dr. Strangelove.
[02:13:56.895 --> 02:14:00.637]  Absolutely, and that's what most people have been brainwashed to believing.
[02:14:00.637 --> 02:14:08.222]  And it's one technique to keep the average person, the journalist, the scientist, the doctor, the dentist, away from the literature.
[02:14:08.222 --> 02:14:16.067]  Because if someone with an open mind reads the literature, they will be appalled, as I was that afternoon, 14 years ago.
[02:14:16.067 --> 02:14:24.773]  And I remember saying to my wife as we were walking to the village council to discuss this, they were deciding whether to continue it or not, I said, this is going to be easy.
[02:14:25.313 --> 02:14:26.294]  This is going to be easy.
[02:14:26.294 --> 02:14:31.076]  When people hear what I read this afternoon, there's no way they're going to continue that.
[02:14:31.076 --> 02:14:52.588]  However, it took us seven and a half years to get fluoride out of our little village of Canton, New York, because all the dentists came in with their white coats on and the doctors and so on, and people were saying... And the AMA and the major organizations, they are all on record paid off by the chemical industry.
[02:14:52.808 --> 02:14:53.468]  Absolutely.
[02:14:53.468 --> 02:15:00.432]  And in fact, the key moment in the history of this, Alex, was in 1950, when the US Public Health Service endorsed fluoridation.
[02:15:00.432 --> 02:15:02.212]  No trial had been completed.
[02:15:02.212 --> 02:15:04.794]  Practically no health studies had been published.
[02:15:04.794 --> 02:15:07.075]  And yet they endorsed it for the whole country.
[02:15:07.075 --> 02:15:20.661]  And within a few, one or two years, all these professional organizations, the ADA, the AMA, the APHA, and so on and so on, they all rode over like a string of dominoes.
[02:15:21.641 --> 02:15:23.942]  Again, with no science on the table.
[02:15:23.942 --> 02:15:26.503]  So it wasn't scientific in 1950.
[02:15:26.503 --> 02:15:31.864]  And when people read our book, The Case Against Fluoride, they'll find it's not scientific today.
[02:15:31.864 --> 02:15:36.105]  They're behaving just like industry, polluting industry.
[02:15:36.105 --> 02:15:39.106]  The first thing is deny, deny, deny.
[02:15:39.206 --> 02:15:42.108]  Well, I'm not an environmental expert.
[02:15:42.108 --> 02:15:49.675]  I'm not a PhD in environmental chemistry and toxicology doctor, but I can read the mainline studies.
[02:15:49.675 --> 02:15:54.138]  And one of the most studied things, going back to even the 20s, was sodium fluoride.
[02:15:54.138 --> 02:15:56.460]  And I've read the studies, University of Texas from the 30s about
[02:15:57.561 --> 02:15:58.762]  Increases cancer.
[02:15:58.762 --> 02:16:00.083]  Causes IQ reduction.
[02:16:00.083 --> 02:16:01.583]  We've given it to rats.
[02:16:01.583 --> 02:16:03.264]  Causes infertility.
[02:16:03.264 --> 02:16:08.507]  And there are literally, from China, England, the U.S., Canada, thousands of studies.
[02:16:08.507 --> 02:16:11.929]  I mean, and these are prestigious organizations.
[02:16:11.929 --> 02:16:17.513]  They know full well, and for anybody that doubts it, just search the term, fluoride cancer.
[02:16:17.513 --> 02:16:18.293]  And it'll be the U.S.
[02:16:18.293 --> 02:16:20.814]  government going, yeah, it at least doubles cancer in boys.
[02:16:20.814 --> 02:16:21.515]  And bone cancer.
[02:16:21.515 --> 02:16:22.035]  I mean, they know.
[02:16:23.737 --> 02:16:25.058]  So please continue.
[02:16:25.058 --> 02:16:43.675]  Yes, well, most of the studies that have been done on health effects, and you're absolutely right, there is no argument that fluoride causes health problems, health effects, because millions of people in India and China, parts of Africa and Mexico, which have high natural levels of fluoride, have been injured, seriously injured.
[02:16:43.695 --> 02:16:44.395]  It's a scourge.
[02:16:44.395 --> 02:16:45.776]  It's a scourge.
[02:16:45.776 --> 02:16:54.682]  And so the only argument then is whether there is an adequate margin of safety between the doses which we know cause harm and the doses that people are going to get.
[02:16:54.682 --> 02:16:55.803]  But it bio-accumulates.
[02:16:55.803 --> 02:17:00.946]  It bio-accumulates, and the doses... And remember, once you put it in the water, you can't control the dose.
[02:17:01.366 --> 02:17:03.969]  You can't control how much water people drink.
[02:17:03.969 --> 02:17:06.491]  You can't control how much they get from other sources.
[02:17:06.491 --> 02:17:07.993]  And you're right, too.
[02:17:07.993 --> 02:17:13.599]  They're now using sulfuryl fluoride as a fumigant on foodstuffs in warehouses.
[02:17:13.599 --> 02:17:17.002]  And that, too, leaves residues of fluoride.
[02:17:17.002 --> 02:17:21.987]  And today, the Center for Disease Control said that 41% of American children
[02:17:25.290 --> 02:17:30.172]  41% of American children between the ages of 12 and 15 have dental fluorosis.
[02:17:30.172 --> 02:17:35.455]  And that's the indicator that the child has been overexposed to fluoride.
[02:17:35.455 --> 02:17:36.315]  And this is the government.
[02:17:36.315 --> 02:17:38.836]  This is the government that promotes fluoridation.
[02:17:38.836 --> 02:17:44.439]  It's admitting, whoops, 41% of our kids have been overexposed to fluoride.
[02:17:44.439 --> 02:17:45.760]  But it only hurts their teeth.
[02:17:46.701 --> 02:17:52.085]  Doesn't hurt anything else, for which they have no scientific evidence, but... In fact, it's to the contrary.
[02:17:52.085 --> 02:17:54.427]  It's to the contrary, yes, absolutely.
[02:17:54.427 --> 02:18:03.173]  I mean, the thing that concerns me most, and one of those facts I learned 14 years ago, was the level in mother's milk is extremely low, as far as fluoride is concerned.
[02:18:03.173 --> 02:18:05.255]  Extremely low.
[02:18:05.255 --> 02:18:06.616]  .004 parts per million.
[02:18:06.616 --> 02:18:10.279]  This means... The body thinks it's bad and is designed to filter it.
[02:18:10.279 --> 02:18:10.659]  Absolutely.
[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:22.367]  This means a bottle-fed baby in Austin or any other town that's fluoridated is getting 250 times more fluoride than nature intended.
[02:18:22.367 --> 02:18:35.257]  But what about the studies that show at 10 to 20, it's in that spectrum, if a young mammal, this is rats, guinea pigs, humans, rhesus monkeys, are given it, there's an overall IQ reduction of 10 to 20 points.
[02:18:35.257 --> 02:18:36.418]  I mean, this is devastating.
[02:18:36.678 --> 02:18:38.720]  Well, these are studies mainly from China.
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:47.008]  There have been about 18 from China, another one from Iran, Mexico, and India.
[02:18:47.008 --> 02:19:00.200]  And yes, they have found a lowering of IQ associated with fairly moderate exposure, like 1.9 parts per million, and I went to the two villages in China where they established that level.
[02:19:00.620 --> 02:19:12.330]  So, if you're lowering IQ at 1.9 parts per million in a study group of a few hundred kids, you don't have anywhere near an adequate margin of safety to protect the whole population.
[02:19:12.330 --> 02:19:12.690]  Well, many U.S.
[02:19:12.690 --> 02:19:13.611]  cities have 2, 3, 4.
[02:19:13.611 --> 02:19:16.473]  The average is, what, about 1 part per million.
[02:19:16.473 --> 02:19:22.718]  And again, from studying fluoride on the periodic table, you correct me if I'm wrong, isn't this one of the worst things to bioaccumulate?
[02:19:22.718 --> 02:19:23.719]  I mean, it's really good at that.
[02:19:24.179 --> 02:19:37.914]  Well, no, you have to distinguish between fluorine, which is the most reactive element on the periodic table, and fluoride, which is the compound, which, in terms of chemistry, it's lost all its fury, you know, it's fairly stable.
[02:19:37.914 --> 02:19:41.678]  This is like comparing chlorine gas, which everyone knows is toxic.
[02:19:41.678 --> 02:19:42.279]  Chlorine in your pool.
[02:19:42.759 --> 02:19:43.359]  Uh, yeah.
[02:19:43.359 --> 02:19:45.721]  And sodium fluoride, which is common salt.
[02:19:45.721 --> 02:19:48.263]  So that's what it means to compare fluorine with chloride.
[02:19:48.263 --> 02:19:54.827]  But the catcher, and the real worrying thing, is that fluoride is extremely active biologically.
[02:19:54.827 --> 02:19:55.968]  Alright, stay there.
[02:19:55.968 --> 02:19:57.369]  That's what Dr. Blaylock says.
[02:19:57.369 --> 02:19:59.870]  He says it ties in and boosts everything else.
[02:19:59.870 --> 02:20:00.311]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.448 --> 02:20:03.870]  Are the threats of a biological attack to the U.S.
[02:20:03.870 --> 02:20:04.330]  real?
[02:20:04.330 --> 02:20:09.294]  If biological warfare is real, what should I know before it happens to protect my family?
[02:20:09.294 --> 02:20:17.661]  The answers to the unthinkable are inside a new book by Christian patriot and author Sam Adams, Pale Horse, How to Survive a Chemical or Biological Attack.
[02:20:18.001 --> 02:20:36.831]  Inside what's been called the must-have manual for surviving the attack and mass panic that will follow, you will learn what the actual biological and chemical threats are, how to respond to events that are almost certain to happen, what the government's response is likely to be, how some will take advantage of the chaos, and exactly how you should prepare to get pale horse.

[02:20:46.397 --> 02:20:48.158]  This is not your father's Biowarsurvival handbook.
[02:21:05.453 --> 02:21:06.735]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:06.735 --> 02:21:10.299]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:10.299 --> 02:21:12.882]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:12.882 --> 02:21:18.769]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:18.769 --> 02:21:25.016]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:21:25.416 --> 02:21:31.397]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:21:31.397 --> 02:21:35.558]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:21:35.558 --> 02:21:39.859]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:39.859 --> 02:21:45.820]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:49.360]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:51.341]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:51.341 --> 02:21:51.781]  It's here.

[02:22:00.108 --> 02:22:02.250]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:02.250 --> 02:22:02.850]  November 9th, 2010.
[02:22:02.850 --> 02:22:03.771]  Gold opened this morning at $1418.40.
[02:22:03.771 --> 02:22:07.414]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1454.93, $727.46 for a half ounce, or $363.73 for a quarter ounce.
[02:22:07.414 --> 02:22:07.815]  That's $1454.93, $727.46, or $363.73.
[02:22:19.818 --> 02:22:23.660]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:24.821]  debt crises.
[02:22:24.821 --> 02:22:26.982]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[02:22:26.982 --> 02:22:29.403]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[02:22:29.403 --> 02:22:34.766]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[02:22:34.766 --> 02:22:35.767]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:35.767 --> 02:22:41.510]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:47.878]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.

[02:22:51.042 --> 02:22:51.263]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.294 --> 02:23:02.356]  As gardeners, we can all relate.
[02:23:02.356 --> 02:23:04.838]  What do you do with all of the excess food that you grow?
[02:23:04.838 --> 02:23:12.664]  Freezing or canning may have been the process you've used, but the good folks at Excalibur Dehydrator have a healthy alternative to preserve the fruits of your labor.

[02:24:14.744 --> 02:24:26.808]  We're going to open the phones up towards the end of the hour if you've got a specific fluoride question for Dr. Conant.
[02:24:26.808 --> 02:24:27.789]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:27.789 --> 02:24:30.050]  1-800-259-9231 to get you up and on the air.
[02:24:30.050 --> 02:24:32.451]  Okay, Dr. Conant, you got cut off by the break.
[02:24:32.451 --> 02:24:36.572]  You were talking about sodium fluoride.
[02:24:36.572 --> 02:24:40.433]  Well, I mean, the term you use is the same one that medical doctors have used here.
[02:24:40.433 --> 02:24:40.914]  Explain that.
[02:24:43.311 --> 02:24:43.951]  Sorry.
[02:24:43.951 --> 02:24:44.952]  Very reactive.
[02:24:44.952 --> 02:24:51.416]  Yes, the sodium fluoride is not chemically reactive, but the fluoride ion is extremely biologically active.
[02:24:51.416 --> 02:24:54.919]  It interferes with enzymes, G-proteins, you name it.
[02:24:54.919 --> 02:24:57.621]  It strikes at the very heart of biology.
[02:24:57.621 --> 02:25:02.884]  And that's probably why nature, in her wisdom, has kept it very low in mother's milk.
[02:25:02.884 --> 02:25:08.828]  And we, in our foolishness, are giving babies now 250 times more fluoride than nature intended.
[02:25:08.828 --> 02:25:10.169]  Foolishness.
[02:25:10.169 --> 02:25:11.570]  It is foolish.
[02:25:11.570 --> 02:25:12.851]  They know, though, and they're doing it.
[02:25:13.491 --> 02:25:20.095]  One of the things we all agree upon is that babies of one year of age should not get a fluoride.
[02:25:20.095 --> 02:25:22.377]  So they are actually warning that age... That's right!
[02:25:22.377 --> 02:25:25.959]  You and others have forced the American Dental Association, what, five years ago, to change course.
[02:25:25.959 --> 02:25:31.723]  Yeah, they are saying don't use tap water, fluoridated tap water, to make up formula.
[02:25:31.723 --> 02:25:33.204]  But they're not telling the parents!
[02:25:33.204 --> 02:25:34.865]  So, Alex, can you help us?
[02:25:34.865 --> 02:25:41.229]  We need to get every water department in the country that's fluoridated to warn parents not to use...
[02:25:41.909 --> 02:25:46.937]  Doctor, and I want to give you the floor here, because you're the scientist, and I want you to go over the science, and I want to shut up.
[02:25:46.937 --> 02:25:53.727]  Because you've got to leave to go talk to the city council people, or I'd go into overdrive today, and you're coming back for a video interview we're doing.
[02:25:53.727 --> 02:25:54.047]  But listen.
[02:25:56.482 --> 02:26:02.407]  Five years ago, when the American Dental Association said, okay, young children shouldn't have this, it causes dental fluorosis and problems in babies.
[02:26:02.407 --> 02:26:03.408]  Yeah.
[02:26:03.408 --> 02:26:10.614]  Suddenly, every major water manufacturer of bottled water came out and said, fluoride water for kids, and it's at several parts per million.
[02:26:10.614 --> 02:26:14.678]  So, no, people try to say, warn kids, their answer is, no, it's good, have it!
[02:26:14.678 --> 02:26:14.998]  Yeah.
[02:26:14.998 --> 02:26:18.942]  So, come on, but we're not going to get into why they're doing it.
[02:26:18.942 --> 02:26:20.183]  Let's continue with the science.
[02:26:21.616 --> 02:26:30.620]  Well, this is the first step, is to make sure whilst we're trying to get fluoride out of the water, let's at least warn parents not to make up that formula.
[02:26:30.620 --> 02:26:38.764]  As I said, 41% of American kids now have dental fluorosis, and the worst year is that first year for exposure to fluoride.
[02:26:38.764 --> 02:26:46.708]  But what I'm concerned about is that when the baby is born, the blood-brain barrier is not fully formed, and not until about half a year of age.
[02:26:46.708 --> 02:26:48.169]  So in that first half year,
[02:26:48.649 --> 02:26:52.791]  The blood-brain barrier that would normally keep fluoride out of the brain does not.
[02:26:52.791 --> 02:27:01.954]  And with these IQ studies now, 23 IQ studies, I mean, what's more important to protect children's teeth or to protect their brains?
[02:27:01.954 --> 02:27:06.636]  Doctor, I have a CBS clip where they say mercury is good for children's brains.
[02:27:06.636 --> 02:27:08.196]  But I'm sure that's just an accident.
[02:27:08.196 --> 02:27:09.897]  I'm sure they're just wrong.
[02:27:09.897 --> 02:27:14.999]  But again, mothers everywhere buying the special fluoride water they say for your baby.
[02:27:15.259 --> 02:27:15.979]  Nursery water.
[02:27:15.979 --> 02:27:17.380]  It's absolutely obscene!
[02:27:17.380 --> 02:27:20.420]  Oh, but it's an accident!
[02:27:20.420 --> 02:27:28.503]  Well, you know, the National Research Council came out with this 507-page report in 2006, March of 2006.
[02:27:28.503 --> 02:27:36.565]  And what they said here, they were asked to review the safe drinking water standard, which is currently set at four parts per million.
[02:27:37.245 --> 02:27:45.928]  And they looked at all the literature, spent three years doing it, and said the four parts per million is not safe, it needs to be lowered.
[02:27:45.928 --> 02:27:56.351]  Ask the EPA, who paid for this review, to do the homework, do a risk assessment, and come out with a new safe... Well, we've got a long segment coming up, but I want... They haven't done it!
[02:27:56.351 --> 02:28:06.074]  I want to go back specifically to the testimony in Congress, and the numbers of the scientists from the EPA itself, and the Food and Drug Administration, who've said get it out.
[02:28:06.354 --> 02:28:15.000]  Yeah, these were several unions representing all these professionals and I think the total number of members of these unions was something like 11,000.
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:25.767]  But one of the most active unions, and this is in Washington, D.C., where these regulations are being dealt with every day, they are very much adamantly opposed to fluoridation.
[02:28:25.767 --> 02:28:27.888]  In fact, the EPA in Washington, D.C.
[02:28:27.888 --> 02:28:29.229]  doesn't have fluoridated water.
[02:28:29.229 --> 02:28:31.951]  They all have bottled water down in the EPA.
[02:28:31.951 --> 02:28:34.613]  And yet the rest of the people in Washington, D.C.
[02:28:34.613 --> 02:28:36.254]  are having to drink this fluoridated
[02:28:36.995 --> 02:28:39.277]  Oh, but it's an accident.
[02:28:39.277 --> 02:28:53.711]  I mean, almost all other scientists, I've seen the numbers, in some cases over 90% of the unions, are writing letters, putting their names to it, but then the government says, not only are we not going to take it out, we're going to have all the companies say, nursery water.
[02:28:53.711 --> 02:28:56.213]  With fluoride for babies.
[02:28:56.213 --> 02:28:57.314]  You know what's absurd here?
[02:28:57.314 --> 02:28:58.215]  They just want to help, Doctor.
[02:28:59.196 --> 02:29:07.463]  The National Research Council did all the work that was necessary to determine a new safe level for drinking water.
[02:29:07.463 --> 02:29:09.305]  And they asked the EPA to do that.
[02:29:09.305 --> 02:29:10.766]  Four and a half years ago.
[02:29:10.766 --> 02:29:15.470]  It would take you about half an hour if I showed you what you have to do to join the dots.
[02:29:15.470 --> 02:29:17.832]  And the EPA has not come out with a new standard.
[02:29:18.152 --> 02:29:18.692]  Why?
[02:29:18.692 --> 02:29:20.814]  Is it because they can't do simple arithmetic?
[02:29:20.814 --> 02:29:22.515]  Is it because they can't read this?
[02:29:22.515 --> 02:29:22.975]  No.
[02:29:22.975 --> 02:29:30.260]  They are scared stiff of crossing swords with the Department of Health and Human Services that have had this practice going on for 60 years.
[02:29:51.695 --> 02:29:55.618]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.618 --> 02:29:58.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.343 --> 02:30:05.886]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.886 --> 02:30:06.807]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.807 --> 02:30:10.230]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:11.090]  Number 2.
[02:30:11.090 --> 02:30:15.974]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.974 --> 02:30:16.734]  It's true.
[02:30:16.734 --> 02:30:21.598]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.598 --> 02:30:22.419]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.419 --> 02:30:26.001]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:26.001 --> 02:30:29.684]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.904 --> 02:30:30.704]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.704 --> 02:30:33.465]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.465 --> 02:30:37.146]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.146 --> 02:30:37.926]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.926 --> 02:30:42.087]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:42.087 --> 02:30:47.129]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.129 --> 02:30:51.310]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:30:58.412 --> 02:30:58.953]  877-327-0365.
[02:30:58.953 --> 02:31:02.877]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:02.877 --> 02:31:06.261]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[02:31:22.537 --> 02:31:25.200]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:31.725]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:31:31.725 --> 02:31:33.227]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:31:53.292 --> 02:31:53.792]  Thank you!
[02:32:02.173 --> 02:32:06.197]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:06.197 --> 02:32:09.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:14.244]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:14.244 --> 02:32:20.630]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:22.873]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:23.413 --> 02:32:23.713]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:23.713 --> 02:32:24.234]  Bernanke?
[02:32:24.234 --> 02:32:25.014]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:25.014 --> 02:32:26.175]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:26.175 --> 02:32:28.416]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:42.304 --> 02:32:44.446]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:32:44.446 --> 02:32:49.589]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:49.589 --> 02:33:02.778]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:02.778 --> 02:33:08.783]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:33:08.783 --> 02:33:11.324]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.333 --> 02:33:21.098]  On a lighter note, before we get back into the hardcore issues and your phone calls, John Cleese, who I'm a big fan of.
[02:33:21.098 --> 02:33:22.820]  My mother and dad just love him.
[02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:27.084]  Monty Python and Fish Call Wanda and all the other great movie fame.
[02:33:27.084 --> 02:33:30.047]  You went to college with him and played soccer with him.
[02:33:31.971 --> 02:33:33.212]  So again, you played what positions with him?
[02:33:52.561 --> 02:33:57.687]  I just wanted to read you, Alex, the last sentence before the conclusions of our book.
[02:33:57.687 --> 02:34:00.309]  It's from Jacques Basson, and it was written in 1964.
[02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:06.296]  He was a historian at Columbia University, and he reviewed the fluoride issue.
[02:34:06.296 --> 02:34:12.642]  And he says, one hopes behind the fluoride scheme there are politics and selfish business interests.
[02:34:13.243 --> 02:34:20.491]  The presence of solid ulterior motives would restore one's faith in common intelligence.
[02:34:20.491 --> 02:34:24.895]  In other words, this is such an irrational policy here.
[02:34:24.895 --> 02:34:26.137]  It doesn't work.
[02:34:26.137 --> 02:34:28.479]  The benefits are topical, not systemic.
[02:34:28.479 --> 02:34:34.325]  There's no need to expose every tissue in the body to unknown toxic... You don't drink sunscreen!
[02:34:35.627 --> 02:34:37.428]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:34:37.428 --> 02:34:45.297]  And you know, maybe the book is... I think it's an easy book to read for most people and it's got all the references for those that need them.
[02:34:45.297 --> 02:34:47.679]  Oh, we're going to carry it too, but you've got it available.
[02:34:47.679 --> 02:34:49.261]  Give us the website.
[02:34:49.261 --> 02:34:52.144]  You can go to ChelseaGreen.com.
[02:34:52.144 --> 02:34:53.025]  That's the publisher.
[02:34:53.025 --> 02:34:54.426]  ChelseaGreen.com.
[02:34:54.426 --> 02:34:58.090]  There's also another... You can find links at fluorideaction.com.
[02:34:58.570 --> 02:35:00.031]  TheFluorideAlert.org.
[02:35:00.031 --> 02:35:05.393]  And you're also going to be speaking in a pretty big auditorium tonight.
[02:35:05.393 --> 02:35:08.194]  And you can find out at TheFluorideAlert.org all about it.
[02:35:08.194 --> 02:35:08.915]  Houston Tillison.
[02:35:08.915 --> 02:35:11.956]  Houston Tillison, the big black college in East Austin.
[02:35:11.956 --> 02:35:14.757]  Plenty of parking, nice facility over there.
[02:35:14.757 --> 02:35:15.798]  And what time is that tonight?
[02:35:15.798 --> 02:35:16.838]  That's 7 o'clock.
[02:35:16.838 --> 02:35:21.180]  And it's very important because black children are particularly sensitive to fluoride.
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:22.621]  Oh!
[02:35:22.621 --> 02:35:23.181]  Accident!
[02:35:23.181 --> 02:35:27.543]  Higher rates of dental phorosis amongst black children than white children.
[02:35:27.543 --> 02:35:29.484]  Part of it may be lactose intolerance.
[02:35:29.484 --> 02:35:40.069]  Well, doctor, I've also seen the studies about not just bone cancer, but association with other bone disorders, association with problems in joints, bones fracturing.
[02:35:40.069 --> 02:35:41.590]  That's right.
[02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:43.751]  In rat studies, causing organ problems.
[02:35:43.751 --> 02:35:45.272]  This is just a wonderful ambrosia.
[02:35:45.512 --> 02:35:46.692]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:35:46.692 --> 02:35:53.295]  We know that at least 50% of the fluoride, and more in children, is absorbed by the bone each day.
[02:35:53.295 --> 02:35:59.117]  And as it continues to concentrate in the bone, it causes symptoms just like arthritis.
[02:35:59.117 --> 02:36:02.238]  We have one in three American adults now with arthritis.
[02:36:02.238 --> 02:36:04.858]  And if you ask a doctor, Doc, what causes arthritis?
[02:36:04.858 --> 02:36:09.160]  They say, well, we don't really know, but we think it's got something to do with aging.
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:18.082]  Well, aging in the United States, it runs parallel to living 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years in a fluoridated community.
[02:36:18.082 --> 02:36:20.403]  And by the way, people then lie and say, well, we live longer now.
[02:36:20.403 --> 02:36:21.203]  No, you don't.
[02:36:21.203 --> 02:36:23.104]  We have lower infant mortality.
[02:36:23.104 --> 02:36:27.085]  If you go to any old cemetery, half the people there are little kids.
[02:36:27.085 --> 02:36:33.467]  We've got old family cemeteries where literally more than half from like the 1830s, pioneers, they might have 12 kids, half of them die.
[02:36:33.467 --> 02:36:38.008]  But then you notice almost everybody else, 95 years old on their tombstone.
[02:36:38.008 --> 02:36:38.168]  Yeah.
[02:36:38.730 --> 02:36:40.540]  So, no, we're actually living a lot less.
[02:36:41.727 --> 02:36:44.888]  I would like to also draw your attention, Alex, to this videotape.
[02:36:44.888 --> 02:36:47.528]  It's only 20 minutes long, 28 minutes long.
[02:36:47.528 --> 02:37:04.832]  15 professionals, including three of the authors of the National Research Council report, two former EPA scientists, one who testified before Congress, a Nobel Prize winner, dentists who had previously promoted fluoridation and have changed their mind.
[02:37:04.832 --> 02:37:11.154]  28 minutes, and I think by the time people have watched this, it's easy, 28 minutes, they will be appalled.
[02:37:11.354 --> 02:37:15.079]  We forgot to turn your headphones on, so they're going to be crawling around on the floor.
[02:37:15.079 --> 02:37:17.001]  I notice them like wolves.
[02:37:17.001 --> 02:37:18.463]  We always have to do it once we're on air.
[02:37:18.463 --> 02:37:20.025]  No, I'm just joking.
[02:37:20.025 --> 02:37:21.907]  They're going to crawl in, Doctor, and turn that on.
[02:37:21.907 --> 02:37:24.450]  So you can put them on in a few minutes, and we can take calls.
[02:37:24.450 --> 02:37:25.732]  But you've got the floor.
[02:37:25.732 --> 02:37:30.738]  Talk about the health problems, the studies, what we know this is doing, and how we get it removed, because you're a busy guy.
[02:37:31.078 --> 02:37:41.484]  You're giving a speech tonight, you're coming back here to be interviewed, you're passionate, and you are also going to speak to a city council person here at about 2.30 is why you've got to leave.
[02:37:41.484 --> 02:37:47.428]  So go over what we know it's doing medically, the things that it attacks in the body, and where this is going.
[02:37:47.828 --> 02:37:56.413]  Well, we can expect it to attack everywhere because it hits at the heart of biology when it inhibits enzymes and plays around with G-proteins.
[02:37:56.413 --> 02:38:00.955]  But we are concerned about damage to the brain, damage to the endocrine system.
[02:38:00.955 --> 02:38:02.996]  It accumulates in the pineal gland.
[02:38:02.996 --> 02:38:04.997]  It appears to low melatonin.
[02:38:04.997 --> 02:38:07.859]  You know, melatonin is like a biological clock.
[02:38:08.799 --> 02:38:17.065]  Turning on events, so we are concerned about the earlier onset of puberty, maybe partly related to fluoride exposure.
[02:38:17.065 --> 02:38:25.950]  After the arthritic symptoms of fluoride poisoning of the bones, the bones become more brittle, so we're worried about increased hip fractures in the elderly.
[02:38:25.950 --> 02:38:27.251]  I mean, there are so many things.
[02:38:27.251 --> 02:38:34.956]  The trouble is that when you go through this list, people, they listen to all this list of potential dangers and they throw up their hands.
[02:38:34.956 --> 02:38:35.937]  It's almost impossible.
[02:38:36.717 --> 02:38:37.458]  That's not possible.
[02:38:37.458 --> 02:38:39.539]  That one substance could cause all these problems.
[02:38:39.539 --> 02:38:40.760]  Well, of course it is possible.
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:45.343]  And it's the one substance the government added to the water, but because they care.
[02:38:45.343 --> 02:38:45.763]  Yeah.
[02:38:45.763 --> 02:38:52.247]  We've never used the public water supply to deliver any other medication since 1945.
[02:38:52.247 --> 02:38:53.488]  And the reason is simple.
[02:38:53.488 --> 02:38:54.969]  You can't control the dose.
[02:38:54.969 --> 02:38:56.630]  You can't control who gets it.
[02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:59.352]  There's no individual supervision by a doctor.
[02:38:59.352 --> 02:39:02.954]  It's immoral to force Medicaid, but now they're promoting Dr. Lithium in the water.
[02:39:03.414 --> 02:39:04.536]  Statin's in the water.
[02:39:04.536 --> 02:39:05.177]  This is crazy.
[02:39:05.177 --> 02:39:06.999]  It's to make us behave.
[02:39:06.999 --> 02:39:09.122]  But notice the people, the way people are reacting.
[02:39:09.122 --> 02:39:10.243]  No, no, no.
[02:39:10.243 --> 02:39:16.010]  They say no to lithium and no to statins, but they say yes, yes, yes to fluoride, even though it works top.
[02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:20.456]  Well, that's because I went to Margaret Sanger
[02:39:21.617 --> 02:39:22.557]  I don't know.
[02:39:45.444 --> 02:39:45.984]  Yeah.
[02:39:45.984 --> 02:39:46.605]  Yep.
[02:39:46.605 --> 02:39:52.048]  And, you know, toothpaste has been one of the ways that most people have thought that fluoride is good for teeth.
[02:39:52.048 --> 02:40:03.996]  But you notice the FDA that has done nothing, the Food and Drug Administration has done nothing to regulate fluoridation or test fluoride for ingestion, has a warning on the back of the tube of toothpaste.
[02:40:03.996 --> 02:40:06.298]  It says only use a pea-sized amount.
[02:40:06.298 --> 02:40:08.820]  If you accidentally swallow more than that,
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:09.620]  Hey guys!
[02:40:32.256 --> 02:40:33.557]  I should have told you this before the show.
[02:40:33.557 --> 02:40:34.497]  I apologize.
[02:40:34.497 --> 02:40:37.938]  But I know I've shown tubes of toothpaste on air from just a year ago.
[02:40:37.938 --> 02:40:38.519]  It said that.
[02:40:38.519 --> 02:40:41.740]  Now they've changed it where it makes no sense.
[02:40:41.740 --> 02:40:43.141]  So they've actually removed that.
[02:40:43.141 --> 02:40:46.082]  It just talks about poison control and don't swallow.
[02:40:46.082 --> 02:40:49.523]  But they've taken the pea size comment away because it was waking so many people up.
[02:40:49.523 --> 02:40:55.406]  But the point is a normal glass, one part per million, has the same amount as what's in the pea size.
[02:40:55.406 --> 02:40:55.966]  Absolutely.
[02:40:56.366 --> 02:40:58.730]  Absolutely, and this is where Monty Python comes in.
[02:40:58.730 --> 02:40:59.771]  Could you imagine?
[02:40:59.771 --> 02:41:02.315]  Over every tap there would be the same warning.
[02:41:02.315 --> 02:41:07.542]  If you drink more than one glass of water a day, then contact the Poison Control Center.
[02:41:08.407 --> 02:41:09.027]  Keep going, Doc.
[02:41:09.027 --> 02:41:10.908]  I'm going to show some people some fluoride here.
[02:41:10.908 --> 02:41:18.312]  So I think that the concern here is that we are not being protected by any of our federal regulations on this.
[02:41:18.312 --> 02:41:22.274]  The EPA is not doing its job in determining a new safe level.
[02:41:22.274 --> 02:41:25.695]  The FDA has never regulated fluoride for ingestion.
[02:41:25.695 --> 02:41:32.359]  And the CDC promotes it and has got a conflict of interest when they turn around and tell everybody it's safe.
[02:41:32.359 --> 02:41:33.879]  Guys, we got a document cam shot.
[02:41:33.879 --> 02:41:35.560]  Will somebody zoom in on this?
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:36.681]  H-E-B baby.
[02:41:37.561 --> 02:41:44.265]  And it says purified water and it's with fluoride added.
[02:41:44.265 --> 02:41:48.547]  So for five years the government admits do not give fluoride water to babies.
[02:41:48.547 --> 02:41:48.967]  Yeah.
[02:41:48.967 --> 02:41:50.668]  It goes through their blood brain barrier.
[02:41:50.668 --> 02:41:53.450]  It causes dental fluorosis with the teeth that haven't erupted yet.
[02:41:54.170 --> 02:41:58.992]  But then magically there's this big campaign by literally hundreds of manufacturers.
[02:41:58.992 --> 02:42:00.833]  Oh, it's for the baby!
[02:42:00.833 --> 02:42:03.794]  Purified water with added fluoride.
[02:42:03.794 --> 02:42:07.456]  Don't you tell a mother that she's been doing wrong in the past.
[02:42:07.456 --> 02:42:12.378]  Give that baby... Oh, look, Junior... Junior's not gonna be, you know...
[02:42:15.001 --> 02:42:19.585]  You may have 150 IQ, Junior's gonna be digging ditches and lucky if he can.
[02:42:19.585 --> 02:42:21.266]  But hey, it's a gift, you know?
[02:42:21.266 --> 02:42:25.150]  I mean, what's wrong with brain-damaging babies?
[02:42:25.150 --> 02:42:27.712]  Look, it's a little baby right there on the cover, Doctor!
[02:42:27.712 --> 02:42:28.353]  I know.
[02:42:28.353 --> 02:42:29.834]  It's good!
[02:42:29.834 --> 02:42:30.815]  Does the child look happy?
[02:42:32.065 --> 02:42:40.135]  It's hard to remember back, Alex, but in the 1940s, before fluoridation began, fluoride had caused more damage to agriculture.
[02:42:40.135 --> 02:42:46.102]  The fluoride as a pollutant had caused more damage to agriculture than any other pollutant.
[02:42:46.102 --> 02:42:49.547]  And this was part, fluoridation, according to Chris Bryson at least,
[02:42:49.987 --> 02:42:51.488]  Oh, that's another issue!
[02:42:51.488 --> 02:42:53.229]  I've seen all these vets on YouTube.
[02:42:53.229 --> 02:42:54.629]  You know, veterinarians.
[02:43:09.597 --> 02:43:23.565]  And they talk about whenever they have droughts out in Colorado and other areas, they will then pump municipal water out to the feedlots, and the cow's hair starts falling out, they start dying, and so the farmers have figured out, man, you don't give fluorinated water to a cow, but look, it doesn't matter.
[02:43:23.565 --> 02:43:27.147]  If I show people a document cam shot, if I just draw a little smiley face...
[02:43:28.908 --> 02:43:34.551]  We're talking about animals.
[02:43:34.551 --> 02:43:43.176]  There's an amazing videotape called Poisoned Horses, and this is about Kathy Justice's horses in Pagosa Springs, Colorado.
[02:43:43.176 --> 02:43:47.998]  She and her husband, Brad, show horses, quarter horses, that won 52 ribbons
[02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:54.481]  And then they fluoridated their water and unfortunately their horses drank that water.
[02:43:54.481 --> 02:43:56.582]  Their health completely collapsed.
[02:43:56.582 --> 02:43:59.444]  They lost 8 horses and 4 dogs.
[02:43:59.444 --> 02:44:02.825]  And they loved those horses and they looked after them like other people.
[02:44:02.825 --> 02:44:03.886]  They have no children.
[02:44:03.886 --> 02:44:04.586]  I've seen it.
[02:44:04.586 --> 02:44:05.667]  Their hair is falling out.
[02:44:05.667 --> 02:44:06.287]  It's awful!
[02:44:06.687 --> 02:44:20.433]  Awfully, I mean, and the late Lennart Crook, a veterinarian from Cornell University, the world's leading authority on fluorosis in cattle, documents that they had fluorosis.
[02:44:20.433 --> 02:44:28.316]  The teeth, the bones, he measured the fluoride in their bones and declared categorically these animals had fluorosis.
[02:44:29.275 --> 02:44:30.637]  Incredible, doctor.
[02:44:30.637 --> 02:44:31.798]  So where do we go from here?
[02:44:31.798 --> 02:44:45.456]  I mean, people should be up in arms, you know, with the pitchforks and torches, not literally, but metaphorically, going down to city councils and, you know, when the smiley face mayor laughs at you, say, look, I know this city's been lobbied and given a lot of money to fluoridate.
[02:44:45.456 --> 02:44:45.937]  Stop it!
[02:44:46.317 --> 02:44:46.597]  Yeah.
[02:44:46.597 --> 02:44:48.899]  Because, tell folks where the fluoride comes from.
[02:44:48.899 --> 02:44:54.382]  The fluoride, it's the wet scrubbing liquor from the super phosphate fertilizer industry.
[02:44:54.382 --> 02:44:58.145]  They had to put a spray of water on to collect these toxic gases.
[02:44:58.145 --> 02:45:02.568]  And those toxic gases get converted into hexafluorosilicic acid.
[02:45:02.568 --> 02:45:06.551]  They cannot dump that stuff into the sea by international law.
[02:45:06.551 --> 02:45:09.252]  It's too concentrated to dump locally.
[02:45:09.252 --> 02:45:16.077]  But if someone buys it from them, it stops being a hazardous waste and it becomes a product.
[02:45:16.558 --> 02:45:20.829]  And the people that are buying this conveniently are the public water people.
[02:45:21.744 --> 02:45:28.348]  So once they buy it, it's a product, and now they can put into our drinking water, which they're not allowed to put into the sea.
[02:45:28.348 --> 02:45:31.431]  And of course it has a whole bunch of other crap in there, in addition to that.
[02:45:51.844 --> 02:45:52.725]  Right, right.
[02:45:52.725 --> 02:45:53.265]  Absolutely.
[02:45:53.265 --> 02:45:55.707]  So what other goodies are in there for the children?
[02:45:55.707 --> 02:46:00.211]  Well, they mine the same rock for uranium, so we have to worry about radioactive isotopes.
[02:46:00.211 --> 02:46:01.933]  Oh, well that's good for you.
[02:46:01.933 --> 02:46:07.458]  But the one of particular concern is arsenic, because according to the EPA, there's no safe level of arsenic.
[02:46:07.958 --> 02:46:14.862]  And so if you're adding a chemical to the water and it contains arsenic, which it does, then you're going to increase the cancer rate.
[02:46:14.862 --> 02:46:24.226]  We can argue about how much it increases the cancer rate, but as we're also arguing about how little benefit it is to swallow fluoride as far as teeth is concerned.
[02:46:24.226 --> 02:46:32.270]  So for a small, if any, benefit to teeth, we are risking increasing the risk of cancer amongst our population.
[02:46:32.270 --> 02:46:33.571]  Another bizarre twist.
[02:46:33.571 --> 02:46:34.892]  You know, I'm going to do a YouTube bit.
[02:46:36.052 --> 02:46:52.247]  Where I'm going to, I'll spit it out later, where I'm going to drink, or maybe I'll put milk in so it's fake, I'm going to drink, because I'm going to say, oh, it's a sunny day, you know, maybe at the beach, and I'm going to take a big thing of, say, Coppertone, and I'm going to drink it, and I'm going to go, what, that's what I do with fluoride?
[02:46:52.247 --> 02:47:00.615]  You know, I don't put it topically on my teeth, I, you know, I drink it so it must be for my skin too, I'll drink the,
[02:47:01.596 --> 02:47:03.098]  The, uh, Coppertone.
[02:47:03.098 --> 02:47:06.161]  Yeah, suntan lotion to protect these, the skin.
[02:47:06.161 --> 02:47:08.903]  And that's what we're doing with it, because it works topically.
[02:47:08.903 --> 02:47:10.505]  And it's not us that are saying that.
[02:47:10.505 --> 02:47:16.571]  This is the Center for Disease Control, in 1999, said, whoops, we made a big mistake.
[02:47:16.571 --> 02:47:20.715]  We thought the babies had to swallow this before their teeth erupted.
[02:47:20.715 --> 02:47:21.356]  We were wrong.
[02:47:21.816 --> 02:47:26.157]  It worked the predominant mechanism, it works from the outside of the tooth.
[02:47:26.157 --> 02:47:34.980]  So why is everybody swallowing it and exposing their whole bodies to it and our baby's brains to it when they could just be brushing on the teeth and spitting?
[02:47:34.980 --> 02:47:39.822]  Doctor, you think the government wanted to help the children they shot up with syphilis in Guatemala?
[02:47:41.671 --> 02:47:43.713]  What about the black people?
[02:47:43.713 --> 02:47:47.296]  Or what about the UN caught this year shooting kids up with live polio?
[02:47:47.296 --> 02:47:49.738]  Oh, it's an accident too, just like the fluoride.
[02:47:49.738 --> 02:47:53.060]  Of course, I have their own documents in my film, Endgame.
[02:47:53.060 --> 02:47:55.763]  And I'll just say it on record, I like the fact you just stick to the science.
[02:47:56.643 --> 02:47:59.885]  But we have their quotes, how they're killing us, and they think it's a big joke, too.
[02:47:59.885 --> 02:48:00.945]  It's very funny to them.
[02:48:00.945 --> 02:48:03.667]  Well, let me tell you, let's get closer to home on this.
[02:48:03.667 --> 02:48:25.218]  The gentleman that was the chief toxicologist of the Manhattan Project, a guy called Harold Hodge, who was the number one promoter of the safety of fluoridation from the 1940s through to practically the 1980s, also was part of the team that injected plutonium into patients at Rochester Medical School.
[02:48:25.618 --> 02:48:26.398]  We're good to go.
[02:48:45.981 --> 02:48:47.522]  But again, maybe I shouldn't read this.
[02:48:47.522 --> 02:48:48.362]  It's a little scary.
[02:48:48.362 --> 02:48:50.783]  I mean, he wrote it, but, you know.
[02:48:50.783 --> 02:48:59.448]  The largest study, Alex, the largest study ever done in the United States to look at tooth decay as a function of fluoride looked at 39,000 children in 84 communities.
[02:49:02.469 --> 02:49:18.036]  And the best that they could come up with in the difference between a child that had lived all its life in a fluoridated or all its life in a non-fluoridated was a saving of 0.6 of one tooth surface out of 128 tooth surfaces in a child's mouth.
[02:49:18.036 --> 02:49:28.121]  And if you adjust the data for the delayed eruption in teeth caused by fluoride, there is absolutely no difference in tooth.
[02:49:28.121 --> 02:49:30.422]  But that's worth having a 20 point IQ reduction.
[02:49:31.527 --> 02:49:32.847]  Well, I don't think it's 20 points.
[02:49:32.847 --> 02:49:34.448]  Well, the studies I've seen is 10 to 20.
[02:49:34.448 --> 02:49:36.148]  It runs the gamut.
[02:49:36.148 --> 02:49:44.209]  In this Chinese study I referred to before, the levels in the water were 2.5 to 4.5, and that was a 5 to 10 IQ drop.
[02:49:44.209 --> 02:49:51.091]  But they extrapolated that this drop would begin at about 1.9 parts per million, but that was with a small study group.
[02:49:51.091 --> 02:49:56.912]  So if you took in the whole exposure range and sensitivity... But people need to not think too much.
[02:49:57.512 --> 02:50:00.374]  You know, we're going to skip this final break so we have time to take a few calls.
[02:50:00.374 --> 02:50:02.636]  Dr. Conant, I'm really impressed with the work you've done.
[02:50:02.636 --> 02:50:06.839]  I hope folks will get your book, The Case Against Fluoride, and it's in bookstores too?
[02:50:06.839 --> 02:50:07.639]  It's in bookstores.
[02:50:07.639 --> 02:50:09.080]  You can get it from Amazon.com.
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:11.822]  I think you're going to carry it.
[02:50:11.822 --> 02:50:23.211]  Yeah, we've tried to write a book which is easy to read or for a fairly intelligent person, but if you are qualified, if you're a doctor, if you're a dentist, if you're a scientist,
[02:50:23.971 --> 02:50:42.548]  Then all the references there's, there's not a single... And by the way, people should buy this book and Endgame and other things and give it to doctors, give it to dentists and say, look, instead of believing what the AMA or, you know, different groups are telling you, or the American Dental Association, read this, know the facts and any scientist or doctor that looks at this wakes up.
[02:50:42.548 --> 02:50:47.713]  You know, my dad's a dentist and about 10 years ago, he actually looked at literature and said, I guess you're right about this fluoride stuff.
[02:50:47.773 --> 02:50:49.535]  But don't give it to them, Alex.
[02:50:49.535 --> 02:50:50.656]  Lend it to them.
[02:50:50.656 --> 02:50:54.199]  There's no reason why you should give anything to a doctor or dentist.
[02:50:54.199 --> 02:50:55.741]  They're earning a lot of money.
[02:50:55.741 --> 02:50:57.443]  So lend it to them by all means.
[02:50:57.443 --> 02:51:00.826]  But people don't appreciate things they get for nothing.
[02:51:00.826 --> 02:51:03.749]  So I would encourage them either to buy it or lend it.
[02:51:03.749 --> 02:51:04.089]  I don't know.
[02:51:04.089 --> 02:51:05.050]  We give our films away.
[02:51:05.050 --> 02:51:06.452]  They're number one, so...
[02:51:06.752 --> 02:51:07.653]  I can't get anything at the moment.
[02:51:07.653 --> 02:51:07.953]  It's silence.
[02:51:35.666 --> 02:51:37.287]  Alright, thanks for taking my call.
[02:51:37.287 --> 02:51:42.331]  Dr. Conant, I have a science question for you and then maybe a general question for both of you.
[02:51:42.331 --> 02:51:47.715]  Let's see, in Austin... Oh, we're getting his audio turned up.
[02:51:47.715 --> 02:51:48.455]  Go ahead now, sir.
[02:51:48.455 --> 02:51:50.277]  Go ahead and ask your question.
[02:51:50.277 --> 02:52:02.946]  Alright, Dr. Conant, in Austin, I'd like to see if you could use Austin as an example with just pure science on this to say, Austin says that
[02:52:04.066 --> 02:52:31.194]  Their fluoride is 0.5 parts per million, and I was just wondering what you would say as how long it would take to bioaccumulate, when that would be harmful at 0.5, and then for both you guys, you know, on the Austin City website it says, you know, the CDC has recognized water fluoridation as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century, so with people saying that,
[02:52:31.880 --> 02:52:33.823]  Have there been positive results?
[02:52:33.823 --> 02:52:35.225]  No, it's all propaganda, Ted.
[02:52:35.225 --> 02:52:36.006]  I appreciate your call.
[02:52:36.006 --> 02:52:36.667]  Let's get a comment.
[02:52:48.823 --> 02:53:06.750]  When the citizen asked him to look at the literature, he didn't go to the anti-fluoridation literature, he went to the pro-fluoridation literature, and he decided, as a professional geophysicist who's headed up research laboratories for Shell Oil Company, he said it was so much junk, it was just clearly propaganda!
[02:53:06.750 --> 02:53:15.074]  So it was the pro-fluoridation literature that convinced him that fluoridation was unacceptable, and they managed to keep it out of Alamo Heights.
[02:53:15.774 --> 02:53:24.058]  Yes, this Centre for Disease Control statement that fluoridation was one of the top ten public health achievements of the 20th century, as Alex says, total propaganda.
[02:53:24.058 --> 02:53:25.739]  It was written by two people.
[02:53:25.739 --> 02:53:29.780]  A guy that had never written anything on fluoridation before and an economist.
[02:53:29.780 --> 02:53:32.021]  Two people from the Oral Health Division.
[02:53:32.021 --> 02:53:37.484]  In this paper that supported the statement, they were six years out of date on the health literature.
[02:53:37.484 --> 02:53:38.664]  They cited a review from 1993.
[02:53:40.265 --> 02:53:43.747]  Their evidence that fluoridation worked was pitiful.
[02:53:43.747 --> 02:53:55.814]  They showed a graph showing the tooth decay in 12-year-olds coming down between the 60s and the 90s, and on the same graph, a line going up, suggesting the percentage of the population... But, Doctor, in fact, he won't believe it.
[02:53:55.814 --> 02:53:56.635]  Guys, queue up.
[02:53:56.635 --> 02:53:58.016]  We're going to do five minutes into overdrive.
[02:53:58.016 --> 02:54:00.817]  Only five minutes, because he's got to go after that.
[02:54:00.817 --> 02:54:02.398]  Queue up.
[02:54:02.398 --> 02:54:04.940]  News says mercury is good for children's brains.
[02:54:04.940 --> 02:54:08.462]  This was a national CBS piece, but they also covered it locally.
[02:54:09.082 --> 02:54:10.563]  And so it's perception management.
[02:54:10.563 --> 02:54:12.944]  Next they're going to say cyanide is good.
[02:54:12.944 --> 02:54:13.364]  Yeah.
[02:54:13.364 --> 02:54:16.186]  And next they're going to say when you're dead that you're really still alive.
[02:54:16.186 --> 02:54:19.348]  Like, oh, he's in the ground now, but he's down there happy.
[02:54:19.348 --> 02:54:20.649]  They know what they're doing, Doctor.
[02:54:20.649 --> 02:54:32.796]  That's exactly, you know, the American Dental Association published an article shortly after they found an increase in osteosarcoma in the communities that were affloriated in the United States in an animal study.
[02:54:33.616 --> 02:54:41.281]  And they published an article which says, oh, guess what, fluoridation is actually protective against osteosarcoma.
[02:54:41.281 --> 02:54:43.342]  So that's just an industrial trick.
[02:54:43.342 --> 02:54:47.824]  If you come up with a problem, they come up with a study which says the exact opposite.
[02:54:47.824 --> 02:54:49.265]  They did the same thing with hip fracture.
[02:54:49.265 --> 02:54:56.569]  Studies were shown... And now mercury, one of the most tested things ever, correct me if I'm wrong as a toxicologist, I mean, they've been testing that for hundreds of years.
[02:54:56.569 --> 02:55:00.292]  And now, in fact, do we have the clip of them saying mercury is good for you?
[02:55:00.292 --> 02:55:00.712]  Here is...
[02:55:01.032 --> 02:55:01.512]  Incredible.
[02:55:01.512 --> 02:55:03.873]  No, I mean, this is taught in schools now.
[02:55:03.873 --> 02:55:11.256]  They actually now, if you go to the local health food store, because they said this, I have vitamins in there that I bought that actually says mercury.
[02:55:11.256 --> 02:55:13.077]  Yes, I'm not kidding.
[02:55:13.077 --> 02:55:14.358]  Here it is, here it is.
[02:55:14.358 --> 02:55:17.019]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[02:55:17.019 --> 02:55:20.640]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:22.761]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[02:55:22.761 --> 02:55:25.462]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[02:55:25.462 --> 02:55:28.724]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Nathur.
[02:55:31.514 --> 02:55:37.958]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:55:37.958 --> 02:55:44.382]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[02:55:44.382 --> 02:55:51.607]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:55:51.787 --> 02:55:54.389]  Okay, so for them, improved performance is being brain damaged.
[02:55:54.389 --> 02:55:55.449]  Now let me expand.
[02:55:55.449 --> 02:55:58.851]  Now they admit they want the lithium to make us more manageable.
[02:55:58.851 --> 02:56:02.834]  Now, expanding on that, Doctor, I could play the clip, but we're almost out of time.
[02:56:02.834 --> 02:56:04.275]  I want to go to more calls.
[02:56:04.275 --> 02:56:06.136]  I have the news clips where they came out.
[02:56:06.136 --> 02:56:08.698]  China executed people for melamine in milk.
[02:56:08.698 --> 02:56:13.801]  I have the FDA now saying melamine doesn't hurt children and might be good.
[02:56:14.341 --> 02:56:15.182]  Incredible.
[02:56:15.182 --> 02:56:18.705]  You know, it's total schizophrenia on organic mercury.
[02:56:18.705 --> 02:56:26.270]  You know, the concern, we're concerned about trash incinerators, power stations, dental offices putting mercury into the environment.
[02:56:26.270 --> 02:56:43.124]  The concern is that the mercury will eventually get into the sediments of the lakes and be converted to organic mercury, accumulate up the food chain, and we are concerned about women eating, pregnant women, eating the large fish and getting this organic mercury into their babies.
[02:56:43.524 --> 02:56:57.993]  And on the other half of the American government, they are injecting organic mercury directly into the baby's bloodstream, at one point, a hundred times the level, the total, that was safe to eat!
[02:56:57.993 --> 02:57:00.554]  But they said it's good for their brain, doctor!
[02:57:00.554 --> 02:57:01.795]  Everybody knows mercury!
[02:57:01.795 --> 02:57:04.957]  I think that's an absolute classic case of what I was talking about.
[02:57:04.957 --> 02:57:07.478]  No, I mean, look, they know what they're doing!
[02:57:07.478 --> 02:57:11.941]  Well... I mean, you talked about, you know, at the EPA, that they only have filtered water.
[02:57:12.912 --> 02:57:27.904]  You know, one of the guys that was quoted a lot, a Danish guy who was quoted by the CDC to say that thimerosal in vaccine was no problem, I think he came out, he absconded with about a million dollars of the research money.
[02:57:27.904 --> 02:57:30.246]  So, yeah, there's a lot of corruption.
[02:57:30.246 --> 02:57:33.248]  Let's jam one more call and we're going to come back with five more minutes.
[02:57:33.248 --> 02:57:34.969]  Let's talk to Rick in New York.
[02:57:34.969 --> 02:57:36.391]  You're on the air with Dr. Paul Connick.
[02:57:36.391 --> 02:57:36.671]  Go ahead.
[02:57:37.833 --> 02:57:38.413]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:38.413 --> 02:57:39.714]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[02:57:39.714 --> 02:57:55.979]  Yesterday in the Times New York Record, Middletown, New York, they had a story about taking the fluoride pills that they give to children every day for the last, uh, for years, and stopped giving them the fluoride pills they get in these big industrial-sized, uh, uh, bottles.
[02:57:55.979 --> 02:57:59.701]  And just, uh, one breaking news story about the CNN right now.
[02:57:59.701 --> 02:58:03.662]  They've been talking about Barry Sotaro's, uh, going to school.
[02:58:04.144 --> 02:58:05.064]  That was the name he used.
[02:58:05.064 --> 02:58:06.565]  All day long they've been mentioning that.
[02:58:06.565 --> 02:58:08.165]  I figured I'd let you know that, Alex.
[02:58:08.165 --> 02:58:09.286]  Well, finally coming out.
[02:58:09.286 --> 02:58:11.406]  Yeah, what about these fluoride pills, Doc?
[02:58:11.406 --> 02:58:12.586]  It's ridiculous.
[02:58:12.586 --> 02:58:22.689]  The doctors and pediatricians have been giving these fluoride tablets to pregnant women and drops to babies for many, many years, and now they're saying it doesn't work.
[02:58:22.689 --> 02:58:23.790]  Oh, but it does work.
[02:58:23.790 --> 02:58:24.970]  It lowers the IQ.
[02:58:24.970 --> 02:58:27.431]  But the doctors are still... Have a little cancer, sweetie K.
[02:58:29.730 --> 02:58:33.735]  We need to warn parents to make sure that babies don't swallow fluoride.
[02:58:33.735 --> 02:58:34.636]  All right, Doc, stay there.
[02:58:34.636 --> 02:58:36.117]  We're coming back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:36.117 --> 02:58:39.381]  Try to jam in Mike, Mary, and Chris, and we'll let our guests go.
[02:58:39.381 --> 02:58:43.005]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.005 --> 02:58:44.106]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.106 --> 02:58:47.210]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.986 --> 02:58:55.569]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:58:55.569 --> 02:58:56.870]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:58:56.870 --> 02:59:01.274]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:59:01.274 --> 02:59:07.220]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:59:07.220 --> 02:59:09.361]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:59:09.361 --> 02:59:12.044]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:59:12.384 --> 02:59:18.888]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.

[02:59:21.089 --> 02:59:26.432]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:59:26.432 --> 02:59:31.714]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:59:31.714 --> 02:59:37.097]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:59:37.097 --> 02:59:40.039]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[02:59:43.281 --> 02:59:44.041]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:59:44.041 --> 02:59:44.701]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:44.701 --> 02:59:45.502]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:45.502 --> 02:59:48.003]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:03.890 --> 03:00:08.873]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:00:08.873 --> 03:00:10.394]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:00:14.090 --> 03:00:19.074]  We're going to zoom in here so you can see Spider-Man for the children.
[03:00:19.074 --> 03:00:20.555]  Aimed toothpaste.
[03:00:20.555 --> 03:00:22.977]  Marvel Bubble Berry.
[03:00:22.977 --> 03:00:25.399]  Children love Bubble Berry.
[03:00:25.399 --> 03:00:26.800]  And of course, he's a mutant.
[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:28.722]  He's been, he's been, so I mean, I guess it is okay.
[03:00:28.722 --> 03:00:29.702]  You want to be like Spider-Man.
[03:00:29.702 --> 03:00:31.464]  Of course, you won't have superpowers.
[03:00:31.464 --> 03:00:33.625]  You'll be mentally retarded.
[03:00:33.625 --> 03:00:38.709]  But it says, if more, it says, warning, keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[03:00:38.709 --> 03:00:40.251]  Because, you know, kids always want to eat toothpaste.
[03:00:40.791 --> 03:00:47.816]  If more than used for brushing is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact poison control right away.
[03:00:47.816 --> 03:00:48.537]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:00:48.537 --> 03:00:49.197]  Oh.
[03:00:49.197 --> 03:00:53.880]  And isn't it irresponsible for them to make this attractive for kids?
[03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:55.962]  It says, keep out of the way of six-year-olds.
[03:00:55.962 --> 03:00:59.965]  They're making them take toys out of Happy Meals because of some cholesterol.
[03:00:59.965 --> 03:01:00.725]  But here, have it.
[03:01:00.725 --> 03:01:02.066]  Thank you very, very much.
[03:01:02.066 --> 03:01:03.387]  This is hazardous waste, you know.
[03:01:03.387 --> 03:01:05.809]  If I had to get rid of this, it's hazardous waste.
[03:01:06.685 --> 03:01:07.485]  Unbelievable.
[03:01:07.485 --> 03:01:09.146]  Dr. Conrad, it is really great.
[03:01:09.146 --> 03:01:10.806]  I hope you'll come back in person sometime.
[03:01:10.806 --> 03:01:11.346]  I would love to.
[03:01:11.346 --> 03:01:12.726]  Yeah, this has been amazing.
[03:01:12.726 --> 03:01:15.447]  Let's talk to Mike in California.
[03:01:15.447 --> 03:01:16.147]  You're on the air.
[03:01:16.147 --> 03:01:17.907]  Go ahead.
[03:01:17.907 --> 03:01:18.707]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:18.707 --> 03:01:19.307]  How's it going?
[03:01:19.307 --> 03:01:19.688]  Good, good.
[03:01:19.688 --> 03:01:20.528]  We've only got a few minutes left.
[03:01:20.528 --> 03:01:21.088]  What's your question?
[03:01:21.088 --> 03:01:22.348]  All right.
[03:01:22.348 --> 03:01:23.228]  Big fan.
[03:01:23.228 --> 03:01:28.069]  I'm going to start wearing a chem suit to the supermarket for a non-organic protest.
[03:01:28.069 --> 03:01:30.049]  My question is about the pineal gland.
[03:01:30.049 --> 03:01:32.570]  I've read all the Chinese and the European studies.
[03:01:33.589 --> 03:01:38.037]  If you go to Google and Google pineal cadaver, it'll be the third link.
[03:01:38.037 --> 03:01:42.745]  It's called fluoride deposition in the aged human pineal gland.
[03:01:42.745 --> 03:01:44.648]  Does it artificially age it and calcify?
[03:01:46.471 --> 03:01:49.252]  What does it do to the pineal gland, Doc?
[03:01:49.252 --> 03:01:50.473]  It accumulates in the pineal gland.
[03:01:50.473 --> 03:01:52.694]  It's like a magnet for fluoride.
[03:01:52.694 --> 03:01:59.277]  The pineal gland, in this study that this gentleman is referring to, has the highest concentration of fluoride than any other.
[03:01:59.277 --> 03:02:00.838]  And that's called the seed of the soul?
[03:02:00.838 --> 03:02:03.059]  The seed of the soul, the third eye.
[03:02:03.059 --> 03:02:05.521]  It makes melatonin, but only at night.
[03:02:05.521 --> 03:02:10.443]  And melatonin controls all kinds of timed events, from aging, sleep patterns...
[03:02:11.064 --> 03:02:12.385]  Oh, and of course they knew that.
[03:02:12.385 --> 03:02:14.326]  Oh, they care about us.
[03:02:14.326 --> 03:02:18.390]  Nobody has attempted to reproduce the study by Jennifer Luke, who I've met.
[03:02:18.390 --> 03:02:23.215]  We've given her PhD thesis to health agencies in this country.
[03:02:23.215 --> 03:02:28.339]  They haven't attempted to reproduce it or either of her studies.
[03:02:28.339 --> 03:02:32.303]  Yeah, but attacking the core of your brain is a loving thing.
[03:02:32.543 --> 03:02:33.563]  Yeah.
[03:02:33.563 --> 03:02:36.884]  It's absolutely amazing how utterly irresponsible they are.
[03:02:36.884 --> 03:02:40.365]  They give every indication of working backwards.
[03:02:40.365 --> 03:02:49.166]  This project, this practice, this program appears to be more important to them to protect than our children.
[03:02:49.166 --> 03:02:51.347]  And that is extraordinary.
[03:02:51.347 --> 03:02:54.327]  They were protecting kids in Guatemala, shooting them up with syphilis.
[03:02:54.327 --> 03:02:55.387]  I mean, come on, Doc.
[03:02:55.387 --> 03:02:55.988]  Come on.
[03:02:55.988 --> 03:02:57.508]  Now you're going to tell me syphilis is bad.
[03:02:58.228 --> 03:02:59.668]  He's gonna tell me Mercury's bad!
[03:02:59.668 --> 03:03:01.249]  This guy's crazy!
[03:03:01.249 --> 03:03:02.609]  We're nuts!
[03:03:02.609 --> 03:03:04.869]  I admit it, I'm a screwball, man!
[03:03:04.869 --> 03:03:08.190]  It's great to calcify your pineal gland!
[03:03:08.190 --> 03:03:10.310]  You're so hard to convince, Alex.
[03:03:10.310 --> 03:03:12.570]  We're gonna jam in one final call.
[03:03:12.570 --> 03:03:14.431]  Chris in Florida, you are so evil.
[03:03:14.431 --> 03:03:18.492]  You're not gonna tell me this guy's good, are you?
[03:03:18.492 --> 03:03:19.352]  Absolutely.
[03:03:19.352 --> 03:03:21.352]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[03:03:21.352 --> 03:03:26.893]  Hey, we have a local commissioner here, Susan Latvala, whose current husband is instrumental
[03:03:27.458 --> 03:03:27.598]  Uh-huh.
[03:03:48.260 --> 03:03:52.301]  Yeah, absolutely, and that's Mosaic, and in this case, Mosaic Company.
[03:03:52.301 --> 03:04:00.824]  And, you know, this is Tampa Bay Water, like I said, privatized, and she's saying that they're running a tight ship this year at their rate increase hearing.
[03:04:00.824 --> 03:04:06.006]  Of course, Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch are involved in this toxic derivatives mess, and they ought to be in jail.
[03:04:06.006 --> 03:04:09.908]  Well, Chris, we're out of time, but another great point, because it's also from the,
[03:04:11.428 --> 03:04:12.829]  Fertilizer mining.
[03:04:12.829 --> 03:04:18.853]  And they just take rock and get all these different chemicals out of it needed by plants, but it also has the fluoride.
[03:04:18.853 --> 03:04:19.354]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:04:19.354 --> 03:04:20.935]  They heated up the sulfuric acid.
[03:04:20.935 --> 03:04:26.499]  These very toxic gases come out, which decimated vegetation, crippled cattle for about a hundred years.
[03:04:26.499 --> 03:04:29.281]  They finally worked out they needed to capture these gases.
[03:04:29.281 --> 03:04:30.762]  They used a spray of water.
[03:04:30.762 --> 03:04:32.603]  We get hexafluorosilicic acid.
[03:04:32.603 --> 03:04:36.466]  We're protecting the air, but we shove it straight back into the water supply.
[03:04:36.466 --> 03:04:38.448]  Well, it is for our children, Doctor.
[03:04:41.229 --> 03:04:45.130]  Yes, well, we've got to warn parents not to give this stuff.
[03:04:45.130 --> 03:04:46.930]  But look, there's a baby on the water.
[03:04:46.930 --> 03:04:47.771]  There's Spider-Man.
[03:04:47.771 --> 03:04:48.771]  Are you against Spider-Man?
[03:04:48.771 --> 03:04:51.451]  No, no, I'm not against Spider-Man.
[03:04:51.451 --> 03:04:52.632]  All right, folks, we're out of time.
[03:04:52.632 --> 03:04:54.832]  The case against fluoride, Dr. Paul Conant.
[03:04:54.832 --> 03:04:56.112]  Get it, get it out to everybody.
[03:04:56.112 --> 03:04:56.813]  God bless you, sir.
[03:04:56.813 --> 03:04:57.433]  Great to have you.
[03:04:57.433 --> 03:04:59.013]  Thanks, Alex, very much indeed.
[03:04:59.013 --> 03:04:59.853]  That was amazing.
[03:04:59.853 --> 03:05:00.253]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.253 --> 03:05:01.874]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:01.874 --> 03:05:02.414]  Take a minute.
