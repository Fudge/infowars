[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:21.400]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.400 --> 00:29.160]  very important broadcast lined up for you today thank you so much for joining us it
[00:29.160 --> 00:38.160]  is Tuesday the ninth day of November 2010 we have an amazing individual joining us in
[00:38.160 --> 00:44.080]  studio in the third hour dr. paul connet director of the fluoride action network and we're talking
[00:44.080 --> 00:51.160]  about his new book the case against fluoride coming up in the third hour today this is
[00:51.160 --> 00:56.000]  another issue that we can take action against and have fluoride sodium fluoride removed
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.400]  from our water systems that are in about seventy percent of the country's water supplies
[01:01.400 --> 01:08.080]  municipal water systems europe is also trying to force these systems into place but a lot
[01:08.080 --> 01:12.440]  of people are bucking against it so it's one of the issues we can have an effect but even
[01:12.440 --> 01:16.080]  if we can't get it out of our local water supply we can educate people about how deadly
[01:16.080 --> 01:21.480]  it is with medical doctors so it's on record so people can take their own steps when you
[01:21.480 --> 01:26.520]  drink fluorid water or when you brush your teeth with fluorid water or when you bathe
[01:26.520 --> 01:33.880]  in it which is just as bad as drinking it they've also reported the large hadron collider
[01:33.880 --> 01:41.040]  has created the mini big bang with lead ions that's big scientific development will be
[01:41.040 --> 01:47.120]  covering that as well you know if you go back and listen to my radio show fifteen years
[01:47.120 --> 01:53.480]  ago I was yelling and screaming about half the time now it's only maybe five percent
[01:53.480 --> 01:58.440]  of the time out of a hundred ninety five percent of the time I'm somewhat calm but I really
[01:58.440 --> 02:03.680]  want to be centered because when I am centered when I'm not on air when I'm just researching
[02:03.680 --> 02:07.560]  I'm so much more articulate than when I just spin out of control with anger about what's
[02:07.560 --> 02:12.240]  happening but this affects me it affects you it affects all of us and some anger is good
[02:12.240 --> 02:16.360]  but I'm here to impart information nobody complained yesterday in fact we had record
[02:16.360 --> 02:24.520]  listenership on the internet record but even if some people like that and like seeing the
[02:24.520 --> 02:30.440]  train wreck and in four hours of broadcast I was calm most of the time but I did rant
[02:30.440 --> 02:34.760]  and rave for probably thirty minutes overall and I'm gonna try to not do that today I'm
[02:34.760 --> 02:41.720]  gonna try to be centered and when we come back from break I am going to cover the unbelievable
[02:41.720 --> 02:48.400]  economic news the huge developments with the naked body scanners and the TSA takeover of
[02:48.400 --> 02:55.000]  the homeland not just the airports we're gonna get into a stack of bizarre news like this
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.440]  Reuters headline look out your medicine is washing you microchips in the medicine we
[02:59.440 --> 03:04.760]  talked about this years ago that's where they were going with it now it's here gold has
[03:04.760 --> 03:13.200]  gone way past $1,400 last time I checked it was $1,418 plus I'll check during the break
[03:13.200 --> 03:19.160]  exactly where it's at on the naked body scanning front though this is now a big national story
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.640]  you did it I did it we did it together with the help of the drudge report there are now
[03:23.640 --> 03:30.240]  hundreds of news articles today hundreds yesterday many of them sourcing back to our articles
[03:30.240 --> 03:42.440]  at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com with people really facing how abusive
[03:42.440 --> 03:48.120]  this is how humiliating this is and how it doesn't protect us from the supposed turban
[03:48.120 --> 03:56.240]  wearing boogeymen and it shows just like the system demonize the tea party but it came
[03:56.240 --> 04:00.920]  to political power now we'll see if it gets co-opted the point is the system tried to
[04:00.920 --> 04:05.720]  demonize it and it didn't work and we're having victories on the bisphenol a in the
[04:05.720 --> 04:09.440]  plastics front we're having victories on the sodium fluoride front we're having victories
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.800]  on the Gardasil and each one in one shot front record low numbers of people are now taking
[04:14.800 --> 04:21.040]  it you know the more the system hypes and pushes something the more people turn against
[04:21.040 --> 04:28.680]  it and so something very special is happening right now with the naked body scanners and
[04:28.680 --> 04:34.200]  it's good to be empowered it's good to see that we can have an effect if we take action
[04:34.200 --> 04:39.360]  it's very buoy so I shouldn't get angry and feel powerless and yell and scream because
[04:39.360 --> 04:45.840]  that's really why I do that I just become enraged with frustration and disgusted anger
[04:45.840 --> 04:50.560]  knowing how criminal the system is and seeing that so many people refuse to wake up but
[04:50.560 --> 04:56.560]  slowly but surely as we persevere and continue doggedly people are waking up so I'll continue
[04:56.560 --> 05:00.480]  along that line and blitz through news and wide open phones the doctor connet joining
[05:00.480 --> 05:04.720]  us folks this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap

[06:05.120 --> 06:09.760]  system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire
[06:09.760 --> 06:13.920]  function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[06:13.920 --> 06:19.440]  anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver
[06:19.440 --> 06:24.480]  lungs generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[06:24.480 --> 06:29.680]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[06:29.680 --> 06:35.600]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this includes the eyes
[06:35.600 --> 06:42.720]  ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our

[07:03.040 --> 07:08.000]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.440]  electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[07:13.440 --> 07:18.720]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[07:18.720 --> 07:24.560]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[07:24.560 --> 07:29.840]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[07:29.840 --> 07:34.480]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[07:34.480 --> 07:39.840]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[07:39.840 --> 07:44.240]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[07:44.240 --> 07:50.160]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's
[07:50.160 --> 07:56.320]  my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup.com or call
[07:56.320 --> 08:05.920]  1-877-327-0365 genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show
[08:05.920 --> 08:12.240]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:17.600 --> 08:24.160]  well it's the kickoff of another live transmission radio satellite television at prison planet dot
[08:24.160 --> 08:30.400]  tv thank you for joining us we are eight minutes 25 seconds into this first hour it is tuesday the
[08:30.400 --> 08:37.200]  ninth day of november 2010 and we do have dr paul connet joining us in studio in the last hour
[08:37.760 --> 08:41.840]  dr paul connet is the director of the fluoride action network and the executive director of its
[08:41.840 --> 08:47.600]  parent body the american environmental health studies project he has testified before congress
[08:47.600 --> 08:51.840]  he holds bachelor's degree from the university of cambridge and a phd from chemistry at dartinth
[08:51.840 --> 08:56.560]  college and his retired professor of environmental chemistry and toxicology at st lorence university
[08:57.120 --> 09:05.120]  he will be joining us in studio today and he's co-written this book paul connet phd with james
[09:05.120 --> 09:15.120]  beck md medical doctor and phd and hs mckelm so that is a very interesting book very informative
[09:15.120 --> 09:20.880]  very important information a new look at the scientific evidence the case against fluoride
[09:20.880 --> 09:29.200]  uh he will be joining us in studio uh here today gold has hit another all-time high of
[09:29.200 --> 09:35.200]  fourteen hundred and twenty dollars and twenty cents that was just seconds ago fourteen hundred
[09:35.200 --> 09:44.560]  and twenty dollars and uh twenty cents uh right now so that is extremely uh important news there
[09:44.560 --> 09:49.680]  if we knew this was going to happen because the laws of finance and economics show that
[09:49.680 --> 09:54.160]  when the government announces that the world reserve currency the dollar will be massively
[09:54.160 --> 10:02.960]  devalued gold isn't going up the dollar is going down so we're going to be going over all of that
[10:02.960 --> 10:09.200]  today fed global backlash grows uh it's funny i called paul watson this morning and i said i want
[10:09.200 --> 10:14.720]  you to write an article about global backlash against the fed and i said you know like world
[10:14.720 --> 10:20.320]  awakens to banker takeover backlash accelerates and then i get here to the office and they've
[10:20.320 --> 10:24.960]  printed an article off wall street journal uh because that's what it is it's a global backlash
[10:25.520 --> 10:32.320]  fed global backlash grows china and russia join germany in scolding obama defends move as pro growth
[10:32.880 --> 10:37.840]  we've got the german finance minister we've got ron paul saying the dollar is going to die
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.280]  and it's going to be a major global depression well that's the plan all these other finance
[10:43.280 --> 10:47.040]  ministers all these other economists i mean there's almost no one saying this is good
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.240]  for the first time in modern history in 97 years of the banking dictatorship they had one of the
[10:52.240 --> 10:58.800]  fed governors of kansas city he came out and said this is going to destroy us uh so this is not a
[10:58.800 --> 11:05.120]  game ladies and gentlemen and i know you know that it's why you listen to this broadcast but i
[11:05.920 --> 11:10.880]  i say this every day it's one thing to intellectually know this and know what hyper inflation
[11:10.880 --> 11:15.200]  and dollar devaluation is going to do and to know it's a globalist plan in stone that's how we
[11:15.200 --> 11:19.120]  could predict it over a decade ago because we didn't predict it they told us what they would do
[11:21.040 --> 11:26.480]  people marvel at ron paul being accurate or bob Chapman or myself or so many others marvel
[11:28.880 --> 11:32.320]  i mean if you jump off a thousand foot cliff with no parachute you're going to die
[11:34.720 --> 11:35.440]  you're going to die
[11:35.440 --> 11:42.800]  you do it argentina and many other nations have done in weimar republic germany in the 1930s
[11:42.800 --> 11:47.200]  i mean you know what's going to happen i'm this is not this is not brain surgery it's not rocket
[11:47.200 --> 11:55.760]  science okay it's not quantum mechanics it's not nuclear physics okay i said at the first
[11:55.760 --> 12:00.560]  little segment that some stations don't care the first five minutes today that i'm going to try to
[12:00.560 --> 12:05.520]  remain centered throughout the entire broadcast i've gotten better at this over the years and i
[12:05.520 --> 12:09.760]  want to apologize to listeners for ranting and screaming and yelling yesterday even though we
[12:09.760 --> 12:16.160]  had record listenership on the internet which is one gauge we have uh i want to apologize because
[12:16.160 --> 12:20.720]  i didn't probably cover one tenth of the news i had in front of me and the problem is the reason
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.000]  i always get into one article in the stack and then run on for an hour about it is because
[12:24.880 --> 12:30.320]  i want to go through all the facets of each report we cover so people can see it in context of how it
[12:30.320 --> 12:37.120]  connects to this overall system but i want to go through uh just a stack of bizarre news first
[12:37.840 --> 12:44.720]  then the latest naked body scanner information which isn't just about the scanners or humiliation
[12:44.720 --> 12:50.880]  it's about the fight against it it's about the the awakening
[12:53.280 --> 12:57.680]  to just how much tyranny we're under i mean it's happening incrementally but we're now reaching
[12:57.680 --> 13:03.600]  a flashpoint where folks are really starting to realize how dire these traits are
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.760]  and so without further ado
[13:10.480 --> 13:12.960]  let me go ahead and just get into this little stack
[13:17.120 --> 13:25.600]  of in-your-face bizarre news this is out of Reuters look out your medicine is watching you
[13:25.600 --> 13:28.160]  and i remember over a decade ago seeing the patents for this
[13:29.440 --> 13:34.320]  where even aspirin Tylenol will have chips in it and they claim this is to track people that are
[13:34.320 --> 13:39.040]  abusing any type of vote of the counter or prescription drug and such the precedent for
[13:39.040 --> 13:47.120]  your body to be basically filled with electronic microchips norvidus ag plans to seek regulatory
[13:47.120 --> 13:52.480]  approval within 18 months for pioneering tablet containing an embedded microchip bringing the
[13:52.480 --> 13:57.520]  concept of smart pill technology a step closer and there's a bunch of other companies that already
[13:57.520 --> 14:02.000]  have actually gotten approval and have rolled this out so the total surveillance society and of
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  course that ties in with the smart phones tracking everything you do by law it's law that those
[14:08.560 --> 14:14.080]  spying systems are built into all the phones it ties into the smart houses the smart meters
[14:14.080 --> 14:18.880]  where the government wants to control your thermostat and all the new appliances by law
[14:18.880 --> 14:26.880]  what is about 2014 or is it 2015 you can pull it up and it's already rolling out that your
[14:26.880 --> 14:34.800]  dishwasher your clothes washer your your refrigerator your thermostat everything has chips in them
[14:34.800 --> 14:39.440]  where the government doesn't need to have a wireless box on the pole and then they control
[14:39.440 --> 14:43.200]  your thermostat from that that's the old technology they're already putting in place
[14:43.200 --> 14:50.880]  this is data transferred down power lines and they can transfer data and it goes into the chip
[14:50.880 --> 14:58.160]  and then monitors everything going on in that appliance this isn't coming this is here so
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.040]  all products will have RFID chips tracking everywhere you go and what you do there's been
[15:03.040 --> 15:09.600]  a big backlash they plan to have this in place in 2004 the Pentagon's on record running the program
[15:09.600 --> 15:15.360]  and they describe it as a total surveillance grid where everything going on in the third
[15:15.920 --> 15:20.320]  dimension that's the dimension we live in cyberspace is its own dimension
[15:21.280 --> 15:28.320]  its own artificial you know dimension within cyberspace within the silicon the silicon
[15:30.480 --> 15:37.360]  but this is described by MIT and the Pentagon as smart dust and everything will have chips
[15:37.360 --> 15:43.520]  embedded in it and so they can track the real world with the nsa google type software and that's
[15:43.520 --> 15:48.880]  what google is it's nsa software given to the front company through nqtel and the cia we told you
[15:48.880 --> 15:53.200]  that seven years ago it was declassified last year that they are a complete government operation
[15:54.640 --> 15:59.040]  yeah don't be evil google see i said i'd just cover all the news here i've probably got 200
[15:59.040 --> 16:04.960]  articles literally i mean 200 or more uh in fact give me a document cam shot just to the wide shot
[16:04.960 --> 16:12.560]  of all this news just today people to understand the frustration for prison planet dot tv viewers
[16:13.600 --> 16:20.800]  so that's what you need to know about that one article okay here is another one no soup for you
[16:21.840 --> 16:26.160]  michael bloomberg targets salt sellers mayor bloomberg's latest health campaign
[16:26.800 --> 16:32.240]  cutting salt intake and he's using taxpayer money to run ads and billboards and radio and tv ads
[16:32.240 --> 16:37.280]  saying how evil salt is the truth there's a lot of studies actually show that if you exercise and
[16:37.280 --> 16:44.640]  drink a lot of water you actually need salt you know uh people have asked me in texas who are
[16:44.640 --> 16:48.160]  from up north they say why wouldn't you go to a 7-11 or any other convenience store do you see
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.280]  big piles of little salt packets and why will you see the migrant workers in there after a hard
[16:53.280 --> 17:01.600]  day's work you're soaked in sweat dumping packets of flavored salt into into water or into beer well
[17:01.600 --> 17:08.000]  it's because they need it if you ever go work on a golf course all day like i've done back in college
[17:08.000 --> 17:15.680]  you will literally want to eat salt um but no if you're not exercising a lot then they know you
[17:15.680 --> 17:20.000]  don't need the salt the point is you've heard them come out and say well they've already passed the
[17:20.000 --> 17:26.880]  law in san francisco no toys and happy meals the government says what type of toilets you can have
[17:26.880 --> 17:32.080]  the government says what type of uh light bulbs you can have what type of refrigerator what type
[17:32.080 --> 17:37.440]  of appliance what type of cell phone and now it's what type of food and and this is the global model
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.920]  to then monitor everything you do they socialize health care then they say well you're unhealthy
[17:41.920 --> 17:47.120]  lifestyle is costing me money in the socialist collective assistance so we have a right to tell
[17:47.120 --> 17:52.960]  you what you can and can't do and you got the cps taking people's children who are obese but notice
[17:52.960 --> 17:58.960]  there's no discussion about this phenol a in most plastic products admittedly in the major studies
[17:58.960 --> 18:06.880]  causing all sorts of endocrine hormone problems in youth and causing them to become obese or to
[18:06.880 --> 18:14.480]  give them cancer or to cause delayed uh fertility puberty in males and accelerated fertility in
[18:14.480 --> 18:19.520]  girls and every time i talk about this moron send me emails and say i'm lying i mean it's literally
[18:19.520 --> 18:24.400]  hundreds of news articles every month this is now broken through to the mainstream and it's admitted
[18:24.400 --> 18:29.680]  in major states what now four states abandoned you go to target you can hardly buy plastic wear

[25:02.960 --> 25:07.360]  on the naked body scanner tsa front it's the same thing there you got a better chance of
[25:07.360 --> 25:13.520]  being struck by lightning literally twice in one year than you do of dying in terrorism
[25:15.120 --> 25:20.640]  i mean you got 20s what is it 9 000 dead now in the last two years on the u.s. Mexican border
[25:21.520 --> 25:25.440]  but that's kind of on the back burner that's not a problem you know that's a higher death rate per
[25:25.440 --> 25:34.080]  year than what vietnam had vietnam over what 10 years 64 to 74 was 58 000 oh but outside out of
[25:34.080 --> 25:41.600]  mind no no it's terrorist and now they're banning mailing printer cartridges added to the huge list
[25:42.480 --> 25:48.080]  so it's this perception management where things that do matter they just put on the back burner
[25:48.080 --> 25:55.200]  but things that don't matter oh we want to protect you we're doing all of this to protect
[25:55.200 --> 26:01.520]  you continuing a scientist find dramatic damage to marine life near bp spill site yeah and the
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.920]  government's told us the seafood safe now for four months even though all the private universities
[26:05.920 --> 26:10.320]  and others have openly been threatened that's come out in mainstream news when they just study
[26:10.320 --> 26:16.480]  shrimp and fish just filled with the core exit and other chemicals the different dioxins the
[26:16.480 --> 26:22.480]  the different things that are in the crude oil and they're told just don't worry about it and
[26:22.480 --> 26:26.640]  remember obama said hey core exits no problem there's no health problems remember he said that
[26:26.640 --> 26:30.960]  three times don't worry then they said all the golf spills been cleaned up outside out of mine
[26:31.920 --> 26:38.720]  that's seeing an continuing with bizarre news the australian barack obama joined muslim prayers
[26:38.720 --> 26:46.800]  at school teacher says and it goes on to say as a schoolboy in jacarta barack obama attended
[26:46.800 --> 26:52.080]  muslim prayer sessions with his classmates against the wishes of his mother well we know he was in
[26:52.080 --> 26:57.680]  a muslim school in jacarta we know he had the name barry satara we know he gave up a citizenship
[26:57.680 --> 27:01.920]  if he is a muslim that i'm not that's not bad i'm not saying muslims are bad the point is
[27:03.680 --> 27:09.760]  this guy did give up a citizenship and that disqualifies him right there
[27:11.120 --> 27:16.480]  so that's out of the australian another report here illegals made democrat governor in connecticut
[27:16.480 --> 27:22.080]  world net daily sanctuary city issued thousands of ids accepted for voter registration well that's
[27:22.080 --> 27:27.120]  what happened in arizona with the sanctuary cities of tussan and arizona and they're not
[27:27.120 --> 27:30.720]  officially sanctuary but they are in the federal court world yeah they don't they don't need to
[27:30.720 --> 27:36.960]  be proved their citizens to vote so interesting uh report on that front and continuing with india
[27:36.960 --> 27:42.160]  since obama's over there he's about to go to the g20 and south korea and see old harley davison to
[27:42.160 --> 27:48.240]  build bikes in india remember harley davison a decade ago said buy harley buy harley it's the only
[27:48.240 --> 27:53.520]  american made motorcycle and everybody went out in bottom and for motorcyclists i talked to
[27:53.520 --> 27:58.720]  they're not very good bikes they look good sound good but they have a lot of problems and uh
[27:59.680 --> 28:05.600]  but there they go to india and just the way it is i guess as long as they talk about how it's made
[28:05.600 --> 28:10.720]  america i guess everything supposedly okay so there i went through what eight different stories
[28:10.720 --> 28:17.440]  uh on that front uh when we come back i'm going to get into the huge developments on the tsa
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.160]  takeover of society it's not just here in the us they all have the similar systems worldwide this
[28:22.160 --> 28:27.200]  is a global corporate model and mode of control to train everybody to be slaves i'm going to get
[28:27.200 --> 28:33.920]  into that uh when we come back from break uh and then we're also going to get into what's most
[28:33.920 --> 28:42.320]  important in in in my humble opinion uh what's happening with the economy uh with gold and
[28:42.320 --> 28:47.520]  we have a doctor coming on to talk about in studio in the third hour dealing with uh fluoride
[28:48.560 --> 28:52.880]  but the minute i have here before we go to break this is out of the one in telegraph today large
[28:52.880 --> 28:59.040]  hadron collider creates many big bang with lead ions now they want to start accelerating
[28:59.040 --> 29:03.920]  uranium and plutonium into each other the large hadron collider has succeeded in recreating a
[29:03.920 --> 29:09.440]  miniature version of the big bang by smashing stripped down lead atoms together the reaction
[29:09.440 --> 29:13.520]  created temperatures a million times hotter than the center of the sun boy that's a good idea and
[29:13.520 --> 29:18.880]  start a chain reaction which have not been reached since the first billions of a second following
[29:18.880 --> 29:26.000]  the big bang they don't know that this was uh expected to cause atomic particles such as protons
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.680]  and neutrons to melt producing a soup of matter in the state previously unseen on earth and they're
[29:31.680 --> 29:36.000]  going to do thousands of these different types of things and they say low probability that it's
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.760]  going to destroy the earth with each experiment but when you do thousands of scientists including
[29:41.760 --> 29:45.840]  british particle physicists will now study the particles in the hope of discovering what holds
[29:45.840 --> 29:52.400]  atoms together and gives them their mass we'll be right back stay with us we're on the march the
[29:52.400 --> 30:02.560]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network alex told you the government announced

[33:32.320 --> 33:39.920]  we are back live thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday edition i want to start getting
[33:39.920 --> 33:46.240]  into the latest developments with the tsa backlash that's happening uh in here in the united states
[33:46.240 --> 33:53.440]  and similar backlashes across the world where this similar draconian control grid and dog training
[33:53.440 --> 34:03.920]  slave training system is being put into place but before i go any further i wanted to let listeners
[34:03.920 --> 34:08.720]  know and i know listeners have heard this countless times when a caller calls in has been
[34:08.720 --> 34:14.800]  listening six months a year two months whatever the case may be they say yes i woke up to the
[34:14.800 --> 34:18.800]  new world order and i found your show and i'll ask them i'll say how did you find the show
[34:18.800 --> 34:28.880]  and more often than not you would think out of 200 million views conservatively on youtube alone
[34:28.880 --> 34:35.920]  of my videos and my show that's just one venue one forum that we're reaching people on just
[34:35.920 --> 34:40.720]  eight youtube channels we have that's just our channels and i kind of count change the channel
[34:40.720 --> 34:46.640]  as an auxiliary because he posted our films over 200 million that's just on the channels
[34:46.640 --> 34:53.360]  that i've gone and counted them up 72 plus million that's up a million in the last week uh on the
[34:53.360 --> 35:06.240]  alex jones channel a million in the last week but 72 plus million views on the alex jones channel
[35:08.320 --> 35:13.200]  i am so honored i am so blessed to be in a position where i can reach hundreds of millions of people
[35:13.200 --> 35:19.440]  that's not counting the thousands of other video sites where my videos and films and and and radio
[35:19.440 --> 35:25.840]  show are extremely prominent but you notice with the callers because i i ask this every day i'll
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.880]  oh you just woke up how'd you wake up my friend my neighbor or a lady at a swap meter a lady at
[35:30.880 --> 35:39.360]  church or a man at work or my brother gave me a copy a dvd we get more calls and more letters
[35:39.360 --> 35:46.080]  and more emails because when somebody's given a dvd it's so personal and they tend to watch it
[35:46.080 --> 35:51.600]  they tend to value it more most of them of course are burned copies bootleg copies which are not
[35:51.600 --> 35:56.160]  bootleg we want you to make copies of them i'm doing this to reach people that's my goal is
[35:56.160 --> 36:00.560]  to defeat these globalists to stop the tyranny to stop the medical experimentation to stop this
[36:00.560 --> 36:11.680]  control grid we're under but when you count 200 million in the last two years not counting all
[36:11.680 --> 36:15.760]  the years before that not counting millions a day listing on the am and fm dialed global
[36:15.760 --> 36:20.160]  shortwave satellite number one streaming internet show on the web according to shot cast and other
[36:20.160 --> 36:29.760]  major uh aggregators that track that to know that the biggest awakening is the listeners of this
[36:29.760 --> 36:36.640]  show who i salute and thank buying the dvds making copies and giving them out to people because it is
[36:36.640 --> 36:43.200]  that seed money the people that buy the books by the dvds by the t-shirts by the ballpoint pens
[36:43.200 --> 36:48.480]  the license plate covers the bumper stickers most of it is sold almost at cost every order gets a
[36:48.480 --> 36:55.040]  free citizen rule book it is you supporting us with your prison planet dot tv memberships you name
[36:55.040 --> 37:01.520]  it but also getting the films and supporting the awakening it's symbiotic that are having the biggest
[37:01.520 --> 37:08.640]  effect and that's why until christmas we're doing the biggest sale we've ever had i know the economies

[40:16.560 --> 40:22.720]  love to give it to everybody for free but i talked about how when we for you know two or three hours
[40:22.720 --> 40:27.280]  on a show sometimes now we'll put up a free video stream box it costs us you know three hundred four
[40:27.280 --> 40:31.360]  hundred dollars just during the couple hours and when i did twenty seven hours the live broadcast
[40:31.360 --> 40:34.480]  a few weeks ago it cost about what was it three thousand four hundred three thousand five hundred
[40:34.480 --> 40:39.680]  dollars so we can't do it i mean believe me i would just give it all the way for free uh but
[40:39.680 --> 40:43.680]  i understand people out there know that they understand how it is to run an operation to
[40:43.680 --> 40:48.640]  meet payroll and do all that also please support our local am and f m affiliates spread the word
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.120]  about their sponsors uh that's a lot of stations have been picking us up and they really appreciate
[40:53.120 --> 40:58.320]  the support a lot of commercial stations even get donations when they put us on from thankful people
[40:58.320 --> 41:02.400]  i've got a lot of station owners and managers call me about that or a lot of businesses step up
[41:02.400 --> 41:07.920]  and sponsor the local station uh because they appreciate that i mean you vote with your money
[41:07.920 --> 41:13.680]  the you know the globalists take your money and then use it against you they use it against all of us
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.760]  so that they forcefully take it at the barrel of a gun we don't do that you know if you believe
[41:19.760 --> 41:23.760]  in what we're doing and even if you have no money that doesn't matter it's spreading the word about
[41:23.760 --> 41:28.880]  the broadcast gets the word out because that's the message at the end of the day it just cost a lot
[41:28.880 --> 41:33.760]  of money you know we've got i don't know eight nine servers uh little ones that are four hundred
[41:33.760 --> 41:38.400]  dollars a piece five hundred dollars a piece every month summer couple thousand uh that's what i call
[41:38.400 --> 41:41.760]  a four hundred dollar server it's not four hundred dollars a year it's four hundred a month and then
[41:41.760 --> 41:47.760]  we have two big cds and i don't know what my bandwidth cost is gotta be thirty grand a month
[41:47.760 --> 41:53.120]  or something and we've got you know i don't want to get off and talk about it anymore the point is
[41:53.120 --> 41:57.920]  we couldn't do any of this without you and look at the effect we're all having together it is so
[41:57.920 --> 42:06.080]  exciting it is so beautiful it is so buoying and and and refreshing to know the effect we're having
[42:07.360 --> 42:13.920]  i also want to thank matt drudge of the drudge report drudge i said yesterday drudge has been
[42:13.920 --> 42:19.520]  posting hardcore articles for three years he's intensified posting hardcore news for three years
[42:19.520 --> 42:27.280]  he's been doing it for ten i guess forever really but uh you know it it takes a lot of courage to
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.320]  every week link to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com articles and now friday saturday
[42:32.320 --> 42:39.360]  sunday monday tuesday five days he's had our stories at the very top yesterday the two of our
[42:39.360 --> 42:45.120]  stories at the very top of drudge i mean millions of visitors to info wars and prison planet and
[42:45.120 --> 42:49.280]  drudge is doing it because he's angry about the naked body scanners he's angry about big brother
[42:49.280 --> 42:52.880]  i used to listen to his radio show one of the few shows i really liked i wish you wouldn't have
[42:52.880 --> 43:00.720]  quit doing it sunday evenings would eight to ten central or yeah uh but you know and and and and
[43:00.720 --> 43:06.240]  nobody's perfect you know people's views politically changed we've been seeing that happen with glenn
[43:06.240 --> 43:12.800]  beck um but this is a big deal and and and look i'm very appreciative for five days straight
[43:12.800 --> 43:18.480]  linking to three or four different articles of ours uh i would hope that drudge because this is a
[43:18.480 --> 43:23.840]  big development would link to this because this is breaking through i mean drudge sets so much of
[43:23.840 --> 43:31.440]  the media agenda and now literally hundreds of articles a day that are are talking about the
[43:31.440 --> 43:37.600]  fondling and talking about the backlash in fact he's he's posted uh i saw this article last night
[43:37.600 --> 43:45.600]  and i thought that's going to be on drudge and sure enough this morning uh he um he posted it
[43:45.600 --> 43:50.560]  today it's big sis backlash it for tsa jenna tell you groping that's one of ours pilots
[43:50.560 --> 43:55.520]  opt out rejecting naked body scanners of radiation danger privacy breach that shows the big pilot
[43:55.520 --> 44:01.840]  unions are against it that's our article and then flyer patience wears thin at checkpoints
[44:02.800 --> 44:08.000]  that's a herald tribune article and i just knew he was going to post that uh i understand drudge
[44:08.000 --> 44:16.480]  just can't post info wars articles but um this is a big development tsa responds to airport
[44:16.480 --> 44:21.840]  molestation complaints and watson did have the headline which i think was accurate this morning
[44:21.840 --> 44:29.920]  of tsa gives the figurative finger uh to but i thought that was a little too racy it's a family
[44:29.920 --> 44:35.440]  site so i hadn't changed the tsa responds to airport molestation complaints and they just came
[44:35.440 --> 44:39.360]  out and said yeah we know people are angry and watch the video clip they show some people saying
[44:39.360 --> 44:43.600]  they love it the media picks people that agree with it and it's all to keep you safe from al-qaeda
[44:44.480 --> 44:49.520]  and they just said you know this is scientific and we're going to do it so i think that's important
[44:49.520 --> 44:55.040]  that they've responded and it's a glib reaction there's nothing to address concerns vehemently
[44:55.040 --> 45:02.400]  voiced by numerous prominent travel and pilot associations but but for me it's like winning
[45:02.400 --> 45:08.720]  the super bowl to have stories that we report on breaking out into the national and international
[45:08.720 --> 45:13.120]  news and having an effect and showing that there's been this huge opposition beneath the surface of
[45:13.120 --> 45:19.840]  the pilot unions and airline heads in the u.s and england and europe and you know so many other people
[45:19.840 --> 45:24.080]  and tsa folks don't like it so a lot of them quit and they just hire goons who do like it
[45:24.800 --> 45:31.200]  and it's coming out the tsa tsa guys hitting on women planting cocaine on tsa being busted as
[45:31.200 --> 45:36.480]  pedophiles tsa making women strip in front of people in public this is all acts of humiliation
[45:36.480 --> 45:40.640]  they've been ordered to do this to see if the government can get away with this see the globalists
[45:40.640 --> 45:50.640]  are all about raw power just like from india to nigeria to south africa to egypt to uh
[45:53.280 --> 45:57.040]  just all over south america peruse one of the big ones brazil
[45:58.720 --> 46:09.120]  guatemala mexico uh congo libya the un got caught adding hiv to the shots and there were hospital
[46:09.120 --> 46:14.800]  wards where everybody got hiv i mean they've been caught over and over again you're like what does
[46:14.800 --> 46:18.960]  that do with naked body scanners they want to put their hands on you they want to set the precedent
[46:18.960 --> 46:23.280]  to take your blood at checkpoints as they've got federal grants to do they want dna databases they
[46:23.280 --> 46:30.000]  take your baby's blood at birth they want in your life they want in your body and they want an army
[46:30.000 --> 46:36.880]  of out of control power grabbing federal minions who aren't swarm peace officers just out there
[46:36.880 --> 46:42.240]  trampling on everyone's rights and the feds now announcing total control of all transportation
[46:42.240 --> 46:48.640]  all schools all power plants all infrastructure i mean this is the new economy the government admitted
[46:48.640 --> 46:52.560]  more than a decade ago the ran corporation said we're going to be a service economy but not the
[46:52.560 --> 46:58.960]  one you think the service economy is going to be security guards jail guards data analysts data
[46:58.960 --> 47:05.760]  minors secret police political officers and now that's what we are do you understand that that's
[47:05.760 --> 47:14.160]  most of the uh tuitions that are being paid the scholarships the biggest group of them now
[47:14.160 --> 47:20.320]  is to is to be part of this to where even if you don't like it that's the jobs that's what america is
[47:23.760 --> 47:27.440]  we're going to open the phones up for the full second hour and the third hour on floor i but
[47:28.240 --> 47:31.840]  i want to tell you the subjects i want to hear from you want to come in up here you can probably
[47:31.840 --> 47:40.240]  take a wild guess i gotta get into the economy first but tsa responds to airport molestation
[47:40.240 --> 47:47.520]  complaints it's just incredible and so why did the government why did the u.s government with israel
[47:48.640 --> 47:57.200]  from 1952 to 1962 pay three billion dollars in adjusted money to tell public school children
[47:57.200 --> 48:04.240]  in israel that they were going to be checked for diseases and that it was a treatment for
[48:04.240 --> 48:09.200]  skin allergies that's why they're called the ringworm children it's a fungus nothing to do with that
[48:09.200 --> 48:15.680]  but they were taking them to x-ray their heads uh in these high powered systems to to to cure them
[48:15.680 --> 48:19.920]  of ringworm and then it came out it was eugenics and it killed a lot of the children maimed others
[48:19.920 --> 48:24.400]  they're called the ringworm children yeah i talk about four thousand plus radiated to death in the
[48:24.400 --> 48:29.360]  u.s foster kids the point is it's every country does this because it's a scientific dictatorship
[48:30.240 --> 48:38.960]  and that was a test for israel will you take poor jews and murder them and israel said absolutely
[48:38.960 --> 48:51.760]  howl hitler there's something big here folks okay and that's what's going on
[48:51.760 --> 49:00.320]  and in my film in game it shows on you know his clips from israeli tv the government shot
[49:00.320 --> 49:04.000]  of the kids and they hit him with so much radiation all their hair would fall out
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.480]  and they did different doses you know that some of them they'd kill some would die that day others
[49:08.480 --> 49:14.000]  a month later some would go blind and there's and there's people all over israel today you know
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.120]  40 50 years old who lived and they're blind and they've got cancers and you'll see them on the
[49:19.120 --> 49:23.120]  israeli news i mean this this is admitted you know people who are israelis they know all about it
[49:23.120 --> 49:28.400]  the average americans like what the israelis did this to 110 000 little jewish kids yeah folks look
[49:28.400 --> 49:30.960]  the globalist want to hurt everybody i mean you need to understand this
[49:34.560 --> 49:40.320]  and so what does that do with tsa it's about testing power testing what they can get away with
[49:40.320 --> 49:45.680]  i mean imagine nurses have known for 39 years whether you're in australia germany england the
[49:45.680 --> 49:54.080]  u.s. all the westernized global empire governments echelon countries that at birth they say this is
[49:54.080 --> 50:01.440]  going to the health department honey we're going to test for a blood disease and nobody ever asks
[50:01.440 --> 50:05.520]  well why doesn't the hospital just do a blood test or have a local clinic do it that's the
[50:05.520 --> 50:10.240]  cover story they do not test for the blood disease no one ever gets contacted and told you have the
[50:10.240 --> 50:16.160]  disease the hospital actually takes blood too they do test sometimes they contact you it goes into a
[50:16.160 --> 50:20.240]  pentagon u.n database that's now the people like yes all of you talk about this every day
[50:21.200 --> 50:28.560]  because these are the key issues we have this giant shadow medical scientific tyranny running
[50:28.560 --> 50:34.000]  around everywhere murdering people i mean i remember it came out what six seven years ago in new
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.720]  york daily news cps workers quit over it but they would take poor black children cps would
[50:38.720 --> 50:43.360]  and take them to do pesticide studies on them strap them down and murder them with pesticides
[50:44.480 --> 50:50.960]  nobody got in trouble i mean come on i mean i mean again this goes to who is our government
[50:50.960 --> 50:55.120]  they're psychopathic scientific murderers we're going to get back into the latest developments

[55:01.600 --> 55:10.640]  boston abc five illegal say tsa approved flight training and it goes over how the federal government
[55:10.640 --> 55:16.800]  gives illegal aliens clearance to fly without any documentation or to rent aircraft even large
[55:16.800 --> 55:23.840]  aircraft see this is a joke and and just like it came out two years ago that the homeland security
[55:23.840 --> 55:28.080]  would do staged arrest even when bush was still in office of illegal aliens and then go give them
[55:28.080 --> 55:35.520]  green cards and hire them so it's all a complete joke again you are the citizen you are seen as the
[55:36.240 --> 55:42.800]  parasites food and so you can see a video report up there as well we've got it linked up on
[55:42.800 --> 55:47.760]  prisonplanet.com three brazilian nationals accused of being in the country illegally while
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.000]  studying to be pilots at the stowe flight school said they were cleared by the federal
[55:52.000 --> 55:58.480]  transportation security administration for flight training the tsa the men who agreed to talk to
[55:58.480 --> 56:02.080]  new center five under a condition of anonymity said they came to the United States legally but
[56:02.080 --> 56:05.840]  now have expired visas they said the tsa never asked them about their immigration status
[56:05.840 --> 56:14.400]  and it just goes on from there so you are going to have your wife felt up but foreigners or any
[56:14.400 --> 56:20.960]  oh you want a big aircraft here just just take it it's all made up they're not worried about the
[56:20.960 --> 56:26.880]  illegal aliens okay they're not worried about terrorism they're training you they get to put
[56:26.880 --> 56:34.320]  their hands on your wife and children and squeeze you got that us titans restrictions on cargo from
[56:34.320 --> 56:43.840]  yemen and somalia they are now uh banning flying with ink cartridges are basically trying to mail
[56:43.840 --> 56:50.240]  them above 16 ounces is added to the new wide list this is happening worldwide canada creates new
[56:50.240 --> 56:57.520]  security rules for passengers following bomb scare and same thing parent cartridges enhanced
[56:57.520 --> 57:07.200]  pat downs all of it so this is how they get the job done and i was looking at the youtube video
[57:07.200 --> 57:13.360]  with 270 something thousand views of michelle one of my staff uh being interviewed last week about
[57:13.360 --> 57:19.680]  how she was uh fondled and her 20 month old and eight year old worm and there was a commenter on
[57:19.680 --> 57:24.800]  there and i happen to know this is the truth it's he says uh i'm gonna know that that that what this
[57:24.800 --> 57:30.400]  person's saying is the truth uh that police aren't allowed to do this but these tsa are
[57:31.280 --> 57:34.720]  just like nobody else is allowed to have these radiation x-ray machines they are x-ray
[57:35.680 --> 57:41.040]  without having you know radiation shielding but here they just wave it i was a cop for 25 years
[57:41.040 --> 57:47.520]  unless it was an emergency situation a female officer had to be called to do any frisk of a
[57:47.520 --> 57:52.880]  woman or minor female had to and this was for an arrest you're being arrested
[57:52.880 --> 57:58.800]  absolutely warrant the policy of the tsa performed by civilian agents who do not have
[57:58.800 --> 58:04.480]  peace officer status is absolutely a violation of the fourth amendment rights the answer to
[58:04.480 --> 58:10.240]  this outrage is simple do not fly enough people need to say no and refuse to fly the airlines
[58:10.240 --> 58:17.920]  will intercede with congress and they'll stop this and you got a mild expletive at the end

[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.920]  have created similar organizations they're carrying out the exact same squeezing pat downs
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:39.040]  the radiation bathing systems there's a backlash in europe idly and others are pulling them out the
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.280]  u.s government's offering to pay for the machines with taxpayer money if they'll do it because you
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:50.000]  see they've got to force this worldwide or their system of total control fails and i've got more
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:00.480]  on the tsa that i want to uh go over uh today but i also need to get into the incredible

[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.240]  announcement that our government is going to devalue the dollar globally and rip off everybody

[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:21.840]  covering all of that as well but i do want to go to your phone calls after this quick break
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:29.920]  800 259 9231 is the number to join us another report you know i went over how illegal aliens
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:36.720]  can come to the us rent even large aircraft and fly around and tsa stamps it and approves it
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.600]  illegal aliens great citizens we got to squeeze your wife's breast because they may be al-qaeda
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.480]  again general aviation wide open it's all a fraud
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.800]  next they'll say they're taking blood from babies secretly which they admit they're doing to stop
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:03:01.920]  al-qaeda i mean 39 years ago to stop al-qaeda but here's a nbc 10 or 10 news report i think it's nbc
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:12.560]  and it says desert deserted island being used by illegal immigrants deserted island being used
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:18.720]  by illegal immigrants and it says san diego news 10 uncovered the deserted island and the risky
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:26.240]  operation that's making it possible for illegal immigrants to sneak into san diego abandoned
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.360]  fishing boats have become a common sight on the san diego beaches very rarely are the passengers
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.280]  found since they're illegal immigrants who are smuggled into the united states in the dark of
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.640]  night again there's these turban terrorists that want to get us any minute we've got to squeeze
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.760]  your wife's breast we've got to squeeze your genitals we've got to do all this or al-qaeda will
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:53.600]  get you but illegal aliens can go get rent a plane tsa signs off on it and at the same time
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.800]  all over the country from canada and from you can just walk right across nobody stops you but
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.360]  if you're a good little citizen and try to drive through they harass you and go through your goods
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.840]  and you know my guys have driven back in and out of canada doing interviews and you know they
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.360]  they get stopped and though you have a five thousand dollar camera you have to prove you own
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.880]  this you're not trying to escape customs we have to fax up the purchase sheets from years ago dig
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:26.080]  them out of storage i spend like half my time just storing data so i can be spied on i mean it's
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:30.320]  just it's just incredible if you try to comply with all the garbage but if you're an illegal alien
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:37.760]  i mean i ought to change my name to wan jose legally you know go down i guess mexico won't
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:43.360]  let me become a citizen though won't let me really buy property except in a few cases and it'll shoot
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.520]  me if i'm caught being an illegal alien but point is go to some third world country where they'll

[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:07.600]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:12.960]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:18.240]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:23.680]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:29.280]  grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.480]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:39.040]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.600]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.840]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:55.680]  know i don't want to speculate but i think it's kind of unique that they all compare something on
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.760]  their phones i don't know if they're because they're bringing phones into the screening room
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:06.480]  and taking pictures i don't know i can only speculate i will say i felt um i talked to one
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.880]  of my buddies who had to go through the security scan when we were both flying out of an airport
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:17.120]  and uh he he answered to me was uh he went for the frisk and he said you know i kind of felt guilty
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:23.920]  i felt like i should have tipped the guy because it was like a strip club but he thought groped
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:31.520]  and he says i you know the guy did a very it's it's dehumanizing it takes away from what we are
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:37.200]  the greatness that we are but getting the information out is important but i think there's a peaceful
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.400]  solution to this and it's a time to take action that delivers results getting information out
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:50.160]  as the first stage and i would like to recommend a boycott of american companies that took money
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.760]  like gm and clisler because if their representatives are not going to listen to us they're going to
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:01.600]  listen to the executives of these companies well i appreciate i appreciate your cogent call
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.000]  that's a good point how many billion was it 30 billion when they were all said and done after
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.480]  9 11 given to the airlines i mean that would each airline it was more money than than than some of
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:20.240]  the individual airlines made in a year that was a payoff to go along with this they take our tax
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.800]  money just like they said a month ago when when when uh italy and other countries started pulling
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.600]  the naked body scanners out the federal government said we'll pay you to put them in we'll pay for
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.280]  it don't don't let a backlash start because if the if the little ants ever stand up to us they
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.520]  outnumber us a hundred to one you know don't let our house of cards we're gonna roll this out on
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:44.480]  the streets we are this is our this is our big reeducation camp dehumanization program that's

[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.680]  ahead and i was going to say but have you given any thoughts of maybe having an interview with a
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:54.160]  you know x tsa person or someone still with the organization well we've had them call in and claim
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:58.720]  their tsa and i believe they are but but i mean it's hard to get somebody on record because they're
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:05.520]  worried about retribution or incrimination uh retribution isn't the right word incrimination
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:11.520]  somebody you know uh uh uh or or or this is i'm trying to get retribution in in in their eyes
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.200]  and so persecuting them to punish them but if if a tsa worker can get in i'd like to hear them talk
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:21.440]  about what is going on because i do see them showing each other cell phones and looking and what
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:27.440]  they're getting is data on certain passengers uh and you know my dad two years ago or almost three
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.280]  years ago was driving back from our family farm in east texas that he visits every week or two
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.240]  and he got pulled over and we'll quiet road and the guy said you know you were doing 75 and a 65
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:41.840]  my my dad said yes and he said well dr jones and my dad's like well how do you know that and he
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:46.800]  goes well i know about your son alex jones you know too and he knew everything about him and told
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:52.000]  him oh yeah i've got you in a database everything about your family and it was the same thing uh
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:58.560]  that happened with enterprise rent a car when i flew into san francisco uh a few weeks ago
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:06.160]  and i flew out in um san jose i go up and she says oh uh the history channel uh you say the
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:11.040]  history channel is paying for your car i can see it in here because i was also being interviewed by
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.880]  him so they're paying for my car i can see it in the computer but it's not working just give me
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:20.080]  your credit card and and she said i promised as soon as this computer is fully back up i'll do it
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:26.000]  well i got the nine hundred dollar bill uh because i didn't handle the price uh this week uh and the
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.160]  history channel is having to go through it to pay for it uh she never did it but then at the end
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.960]  she said i see your address is this on your license but she said this is where you really
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.880]  live and i've gone to great you know trouble people think they know where i live they don't
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:44.720]  uh to to to you know have that obscure a public figure and she just giddled and laughed she knew
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.120]  everything she had the same database because she's part of infrastructure protection and she was
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:53.280]  asking every person as they went to the airport where are you going this is 11 o'clock at night
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:57.360]  i'm sitting there exhausted there's families there and she's like where are you going how you doing
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:02.640]  and people are going to see my mom oh your mom where's she live um she's a little secret police
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:08.240]  officer and she's there on this power trip and the tsa workers have now been given national
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:13.760]  security clearance it's all part of infragar but i'm sorry uh why would you specifically frank
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.600]  want to hear uh from a tsa person what do you want to hear from a tsa person on
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.280]  i think it'd be interesting to just find out about the culture of perversion and what's
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.200]  going on in there you know one thing i also noticed when i i won't try to warn them about the
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:33.120]  radiation danger and they all give me a real robotic type response always it's the same thing
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.280]  different people say the same thing oh it's equivalent to 15 minutes of flight in an airplane
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.040]  and you know you can tell they've all been trained to say that every time to everybody
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:47.440]  and uh well that's actually true and that's why studies show that pilots have all sorts of health
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:51.840]  problems even though they're in great shape and go blind early and a lot of other things because
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.400]  there is and every time i talk about the second email because people are ignorant i appreciate your
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:06.080]  call uh frank every time i say there's 10 feet of water from sea level to 30 000 feet people go
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:12.320]  there's no water up there yeah there is on average with average humidity it's a little over 10 feet
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:18.160]  of water in the first 30 000 feet if you condensed it down that's what an acola blue water filter
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.960]  does it grabs it out of the air it's clouds and that is incredible shielding from from the solar
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:30.640]  radiation there's also on average depending on the study a centimeter to an inch of rock so it's not
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:36.080]  just shooting through uh water there's a centimeter depending on where they do the studies with
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:42.800]  airplanes to an inch of rock all those particulate all that dust potash in the air it has to shoot
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:48.560]  through and so uh it is the equivalent i don't know if it's 15 minutes of the radiation you're
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:54.000]  getting while you're flying and that's why we get cancer it's radiation from the sun it damages our
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:02.800]  dna uh but they're just idiots we'll be right back stay with us is it really possible to get out of

[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:33.040]  have a hospital district tax they have an unsold inventory tax it's just insane right so i mean
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:37.920]  i'm taking it on the on the personal family front and i'm taking it on the professional front and
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.480]  and you understand what i'm talking about there and the traveling you know my way of protesting
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:48.400]  the tsa people is i don't fly anymore i just won't do it because i saw this coming and then i got into
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.880]  the ideology of we're trying to be a little bit more self-sufficient you know i want to collect
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:57.760]  some rain water and filter it um i've gotten into doing some some ethical christian biblical
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.080]  hunting where i don't go out and hunt for racks but i actually eat the meat you know that kind of thing
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.880]  and they're actually attacking me on that front there there's there's uh you talked about this
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:12.080]  morning about the salt restriction i gotta tell you brother you gotta understand them limiting
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:18.160]  salt is not just about controlling what we eat though that's a big part of it but salt is a major
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:24.880]  major preservative and if you have salt and you know how to tan hides and you know how to use
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:30.080]  hides and and being a christian biblical hunter i didn't want to waste any of the meat or any of
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:35.040]  the hiding of the animals that i and by the way you have all that hard programming you know in
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:39.920]  your genetic code to hunt that's why it feels so good you don't even enjoy killing the animal
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:45.120]  but it's the hunting it's the gutting it's it's the it's the butchering it's just like planting
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:52.480]  plants feels so good collecting wild plums or grapes feels good it feels magic while you're
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:59.600]  doing it because that's what you're designed to do and and and you're making really good points i
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:04.240]  appreciate your call quintin good to have you on board with us uh let's talk to tim and washington

[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:20.880]  the precedence is they're completely out of control they started it in new york with army and national
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:27.600]  guard out searching people they started it then in boston and houston i mean they've had viper
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:33.760]  teams on the streets for nine years and now they say random checkpoints malls but instead of having
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:40.720]  more highly paid and trained police it's tsa and you just search viper teams on the streets they
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:45.280]  now do knock and talks feds come to your door and ask about your guns they're doing it in chicago
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:52.560]  and also in boston just the places i've seen it in the news oh hi i'm a federal uh security guard

[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:22.400]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:28.640]  respiratory system with yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.080]  nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:40.320]  of nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.440]  generator very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided making production

[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:07.760]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:13.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:18.560]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:23.840]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:29.120]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:34.240]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.800]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:43.440]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:47.840]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:53.760]  www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:33:07.600]  own the sun should go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 we now take you live
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:14.400]  to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the alex jones
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:26.240]  show
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:38.960]  it is tuesday the ninth day of november 2010 thank you so much for joining us coming up in about
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:45.040]  30 minutes we're going to have a doctor in studio with us phd top toxicologist
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.560]  head of the fluoride action network exposing the dangers of fluoride this is one place
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:34:00.160]  of many but a big area that we can take control of our lives in now tim in washington
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:08.880]  was bringing up congress getting rid of the derivatives 11 years ago in 1999 bill clinton
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:17.520]  along with the republican leadership got rid of the depression era law stating that banks
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:24.560]  that is brokerage banks big investment banks could not basically create all these artificial
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:29.600]  instruments this counterfeit the banks are allowed to have fractional reserve banking for every
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.600]  dollar they've got they can run out about 10 on average have just made up money
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:41.200]  and the big mega banks are always held to standards that other smaller banks
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.400]  aren't allowed to get away with and so that's what's happening on that front they can get
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:54.480]  away with murder so instead of getting rid of the derivatives they actually allowed derivatives and
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:01.280]  expanded derivatives and then passed the banking reorganization act earlier this year that allowed
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:09.040]  the big mega banks to control the regulators to go in and take over your local banks and basically
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:16.160]  feed healthy banks and unhealthy banks into the big mega sex banks so it's a vertical integration
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:23.680]  so the answer is the derivatives are accelerating all the fraud is accelerating and i have french
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:28.640]  news agency here what an incredible announcement you in calls for higher taxes to combat climate
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:35.200]  warning warning and they want the money to be paid into the new imf world bank s dr system
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:42.800]  when you get into the fine print of all this here's another one bloomberg bank tax co2 auctions
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:51.840]  recommended by soros panel to help climate efforts and it says at least 65 billion to start
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:57.520]  needs to be raised by taxing foreign exchange transactions a global vat financial tax and
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:02.720]  auctioning pollution permits a united nations panel said today in a report recommending ways to finance
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:09.200]  foreign aid and fight global warming had nothing to do with helping the third world
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:14.640]  that's why the third world read the copenhagen trading and said not just no but absolutely no
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:21.920]  no and george soros is in the news pushing for that and dealing with gold above fourteen hundred
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:26.960]  and twenty two dollars an ounce right now silver exploding up to twenty seven dollars an ounce
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:32.320]  it's a law of finance even in this fraudulent system
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.200]  that when they announce they're going to monetize debt and devalue the dollar
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:43.840]  that that's the end of the currency if this continues and so gold and silver and oil and
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:49.120]  food and every other commodity is going up up up up up up up up up but the globalists have to
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.840]  have the next ponzi scheme the next bubble and that's a completely private they transcend governments
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:59.680]  now imf world bank s dr they've already been testing the last few years trillions of dollars of it
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:05.840]  but now it's going to be partially gold back this is zolic seeks gold standard debate the g20 has
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:10.560]  always been moving towards this right now they're just introducing it it'll be partially gold back
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:15.520]  so that every other currency will look worthless compared to it so you'll want the s dr's but
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.480]  they're only digital so you'll get an s dr card and that'll be thumbprint face scan that's where
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:27.280]  this is going this is all their plan that everything you do is tracked and traced in fact um i wanted
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:34.640]  to read to you from revelations 1316 18 he also forced everyone small and great rich and poor free
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:42.000]  and slave to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead so that no one could buy or sell
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:50.480]  unless he had the mark which is the name of the beast or the number of his name see it's a human
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:56.720]  number let him have understanding reckon it's number it's a biometric scan of your face of your
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:04.480]  hand it creates a number from your body and this is one of the modern bible versions you guys
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:09.120]  did a great job printing that for me print me a king james version of revelation 1316 18
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:17.680]  that's the really powerful one he also forced everyone small and great rich and poor free
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:23.600]  and slave to receive a mark on his right hand or in his forehead so that no one could buy or sell
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:30.480]  unless he had that mark which is the name of the beast or the number of his name this calls for
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:35.920]  wisdom if anyone has insight let him calculate the number of the beast for his man's number his
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:45.600]  number is 666 let me read the king james version and he causes all both small and great rich and
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:55.040]  poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead and that no man
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:03.520]  might buy or sell save he had that mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:11.200]  here is wisdom let he that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:19.600]  number of a man and his number is 600 and three score and six and i read that reuters article
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.640]  oh your medication from tile and all to you name it's going to have microchips to make sure you're
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:31.520]  not abusing it and you will swallow it and then all the smart meters in your house by law they're
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:36.560]  moving towards this your medicine cabinet will be a smart cabinet tracking all that this has all
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:40.640]  been announced the federal government and they're also doing it in England going back five years
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:47.200]  offers old people free housing if they live in giant dormitories where their refrigerator tracks
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:54.400]  everything there's chips in the pills their face scanned the the mirror in their bathroom face scans
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:00.480]  them this is already in place so they're beta testing your death grid and what does bill gates say
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:05.360]  he sits there with that little demonic smile and says well you're not supposed to talk about death
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:10.880]  panels but if we just don't give a grandmother care we can hire 10 teachers and all the little
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:17.200]  teachers in the audience like oh somebody dies i get money so they play us off against each other
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:25.840]  you fools bill gates what a wicked devil and i get to hear people you know at my parents church

[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:02.560]  excuse me and uh and so now we're seeing uh the european countries falling apart too so
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:08.080]  it's like this big race to the bottom and the united states is i think in the lead but uh
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:14.800]  you know the gold i mean come on silver silver at 29 dollars and 38 cents we're gonna hit that
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:21.600]  50 dollars an ounce gold right now has a resistance level of 1450 dollars that's when we that's where
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:26.800]  we start to see resistance in the gold price we blew through 1400 bucks like there's nothing there
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.440]  and silver i mean just about a week ago we were wondering whether silver was going to go from 24
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:37.520]  to 25 dollars an ounce and now it's just 50 cents short of 30 i mean my goodness i mean a alex if
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:43.360]  people haven't woken up by this point especially on that video offer i'm scratching my head silver
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:48.560]  dollars alex are over 30 bucks a piece now and we're delivering four of the three of those silver
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:54.880]  dollars and your videos right now for 89 dollars and uh you know that doesn't even that doesn't
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:01.040]  cover the postage i mean it's a complete loss leader and i'm just it's 160 dollar value because
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:06.400]  shipping's included for 89 dollars and you're gonna have to go up soon on that tag as you're
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:12.080]  running out of the silver you bought at the lower uh price three silver dollars three of my most
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:20.400]  powerful films in the hardcover dvd case to give us gifts or to watch yourself uh and shipping for 89
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:28.720]  dollars that is let me see uh so comes up to about 160 and then and then 11 uh so we're talking about
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:34.160]  71 dollar discount ted i know it's but you know the thing about it is is we put this together
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:39.200]  when silver was about 23 dollars an ounce and i thought you know this this will be a great offer
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:44.800]  for people i didn't realize how great it was i mean the main thing is how long till you run out of
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:49.200]  those silver dollars that you bought back at 23 well that's that's the problem right now i'm running
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.880]  right on the edge of that right now and well it's still gonna be a great deal when you're charging
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:58.640]  100 bucks for three silver dollars uh and and and the three films and free shipping but folks i would
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.280]  take advantage of this now i was talking to ted this morning uh the films are flying off the shelf
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:07.280]  and the silver dollars are running out at the earlier price he bought them and he's already losing
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:14.080]  money on this he can't lose more if this continues he's gonna have to go up 800 686 2 to 3 7 you're
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:18.800]  not only getting an unbelievable all-time best deal there's really no profit so i guess in a way it
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:23.200]  doesn't support the network but you know this is genesis this is my best resource is the parent
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:28.080]  company we've been in this since you know gold was 250 bucks an ounce telling you they're devaluing
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.480]  the dollar you know 12 13 years ago you better get into gold and silver now you would have listened
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:37.360]  to us where would you be people said oh a thousand bucks six months ago you know i can't get into
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:42.640]  gold it's too much well does a thousand look like too much now within it 1400 and 20 something an ounce
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:47.840]  ladies and gentlemen now is the time to get involved today but folks some people uh you know
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:51.680]  ted don't just want three silver dollars some people just don't want one frank and a free
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:57.600]  international forecaster your subscription that's an incredible deal some people want gold silver
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:02.400]  coins some people are starting to get smart and and and hedging their bets and getting out of paper
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:08.080]  and stocks and bonds that they see the writing on the wall uh tell folks about some of your best deals
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:14.080]  on gold and silver first of all alex people have to really take a serious look at their portfolios
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:18.880]  right now i mean if you're in the stock market if you have bonds if you are cash in the bank
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:22.800]  if you're invested in annuities i mean you gotta remember annuities aren't even guaranteed or
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:28.480]  insured by the united states government at all there's so much risk in that because it's all
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:34.000]  tied to this currency where we have the g20 meeting happening this thursday and china is
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.560]  going to be wondering what to do with the rest of its u.s government securities they're going to be
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:44.160]  selling they want to get away from the u.s dollar the dollar is in a is in a freefall right now
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:49.120]  and gold and silver is reflecting it and if you haven't seriously taken a look at what you're doing
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:53.680]  with your money that you're saving for cash flow for your business if you have money invested in
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:58.880]  the stock market the banks or wherever it is right now you better be considering gold and silver
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:06.960]  because cash is like produce at the grocery store it is losing purchasing power and it is it has an
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:14.000]  expiration date coming to us well ten ten to be specific here i'm not tuning our horn i'm not happy
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:20.080]  that we're totally 100 right on this that we predicted the global s dr that we decades ago
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:26.400]  that we laid out how they devalue it how they'd have a currency war and then offer this new global
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:31.840]  cashless system partially gold back as the solution once they've hoarded all the gold which they've
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:37.120]  been buying with their fake paper hoarding and all the elites all the wealthy all the insiders
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:40.880]  then they're going to put us on a partial gold standard it might even be five years down the
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:46.960]  road the point is then gold might be 10 000 announced in s dr's they're killing all the currencies to
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:52.640]  force us on this new global currency and gold you know it goes up to a thousand goes to 900 goes to
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:59.760]  1200 goes to 1100 goes to you know 1300 goes back down to a thousand goes to 14 might go back down
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:06.640]  to 13 i doubt it because they have signified and announced what they're doing and they're telling us
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:11.280]  inflation you know new york times headline inflation bernack he says is the answer to our
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:17.040]  problems that's like if you've got one leg chopped off chopping the other off and or if you got one
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:21.040]  bullet wound in your chest shooting yourself in the head they're like we're going to shoot ourselves
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:25.040]  in the head and that's going to help us well it's going to help the big mega banks making record
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:31.280]  bonuses record profits this is financial global war when hitler took over poland he had to blow
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.520]  up a lot of stuff you know when the soviets took over eastern europe they had to destroy a lot of
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.720]  stuff they are destroying things to consolidate it and be on top of it i heard a talk show host
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.160]  this morning saying the elite don't care if they devalue the dollar they it's not that they don't
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:51.360]  care this is a weapon we've got the trilateral commission cfr u n reports we knew exactly what
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:58.240]  they do we told you and read the documents on air i've been on air 15 years uh you know the

[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:38.720]  rockefeller admits in his book he wants world government and he said people accuse me of wanting
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:43.440]  to get rid of the u.s sovereignty and set up a one-world government well i say guilty guilty

[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:20.400]  that activates the release of prostaglandin hormones your body's own prostaglandin hormones
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:25.440]  eliminate inflammation and the pain that it is causing the result is the elimination of pain

[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:11.040]  today here in studio back in 2000 they testified before congress uh other scientists and uh
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:15.840]  environmental researchers toxicologists i've interviewed some of those folks the vast majority
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:22.560]  i think was over 90 percent of their toxicologist uh at the uh epa uh also the fda had scientists
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.520]  send letters the vast majority said sodium fluorides deadly poisonous increases cancer
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:33.280]  so it's not like there's just a few medical doctors or scientists or toxicologists saying this
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:38.320]  this is the vast bulk and uh dr connan who's always you know up on the latest info he can
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:43.360]  correct all my numbers and go over it but he has the new book out the case against fluoride a new
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:49.040]  look at the scientific evidence how hazardous waste ended up in our drinking water

[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:18.640]  the foods on the crops and then it bio accumulates but instead of alex jones talking about this we
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:24.320]  go to dr paul connet he is the director of the fluoride action network fan fluoride alert dot

[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:25.200]  professionals dentists doctors nurses all kinds of professionals involved in health
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:31.200]  environment and so on have signed a statement calling for an end to fluoridation worldwide
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:36.880]  so i've been researching this for 14 years and i didn't want the issue because at 14 years ago
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:41.840]  i was very busy teaching chemistry and working on the waste management that you've just talked about
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:47.440]  and that was taking up most of my weekends and holidays but my wife put down this bunch of papers
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:53.520]  on my desk and said dear would you read these i said what is it she said fluoridation i said take
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:58.640]  that away these people are crazy yeah dr strangelove yeah absolutely that and that's what most people
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:04.560]  being brainwashed to believing and it's one technique to keep the average person the journalist
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:10.000]  the scientist the doctor the dentist away from the literature because if someone with an open
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:16.480]  mind reads the literature they will be appalled as i was that afternoon 14 years ago and i remember
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:21.600]  saying to my wife as we walk into the village council to discuss this they were deciding whether
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:26.880]  to continue it or not i said this is going to be easy this is going to be easy when people hear
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:32.400]  what i read this afternoon there's no way they're going to continue that however it took us seven
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:37.920]  and a half years to get fluoride out of our little village of canton new york because all the dentists
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:44.480]  came in with their white coats on and the doctors and so on and people were saying and the am a and
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:53.520]  the major organizations they are all on record paid off by the chemical industry absolutely and
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:58.720]  in fact the key moment in the history of this alex was in 1950 when the u.s public health service
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:04.640]  endorsed fluoridation no trial had been completed practically no health studies had been published
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:10.640]  and yet they endorsed it for the whole country and within a few of one or two years all these
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:17.840]  professional organizations the ad a the am a the a ph a and so on and so on and so they all
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:25.120]  rolled over like a a a string of dominoes again with no science on the table so it wasn't scientific
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:31.040]  in 1950 and when people read our book the case against fluoride they'll find it's not scientific
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:39.280]  today they're behaving just like industry polluting industry the first thing is deny deny deny well
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:46.640]  i'm not a uh environmental you know expert i'm not a a phd an environmental chemistry and toxicology
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:52.080]  a doctor but i can read the mainline studies and one of the most studied things going back to even
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:57.440]  the 20s was sodium fluoride and i've read the studies university of texas from the 30s about
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:04.640]  increases cancer causes iq reduction we've given it to rats causes infertility and there are literally
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:10.640]  from china england the u.s can thousands of studies i mean the and these are prestigious
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:16.640]  organizations they know full well and for anybody that doubts it just search the term fluoride
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:21.360]  cancer and it'll be the u.s government going out at least doubles cancer and boys and bone cancer
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:28.640]  i mean they know so please continue yes well the um most of the studies that have been done on
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:33.040]  health effects and the agent they're you're absolutely right there is no argument that fluoride
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:38.400]  causes health problems health effects because millions of people in india and china parts of
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:43.520]  africa and mexico which have high natural levels of fluoride have been injured seriously injured
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:48.560]  it's a scourge it's a scourge and and so the only argument then is whether there is an adequate
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:54.240]  margin of safety between the doses which we know cause harm and the doses that people are going
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:59.280]  to get but it bio accumulates it bio accumulates and the doses and remember once you put it in the
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:04.720]  water you can't control the dose you can't control how much water people drink you can't control how
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:10.400]  much they get from other sources and you're right too they're now using sulfur or fluoride
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:18.000]  as a fumigant on foodstuffs in warehouses and that too leaves residues of fluoride and today
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:26.080]  the scent of disease control said that 41 percent of american children 41 percent of american
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:32.560]  children between the ages of 12 and 15 have dental fluorosis and that's the indicator that the child
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:37.920]  has been overexposed to fluoride and this is the government this is the government that promotes
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:44.720]  fluoridation is admitting whoops 41 percent of our kids have been overexposed to fluoride but
[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:50.560]  it only hurts the teeth doesn't hurt anything else for which they have no scientific evidence but
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:55.760]  in fact it's to the contrary it's to the contrary yes absolutely i mean the thing that concerns me
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:01.760]  most and one of those facts i learned 14 years ago was the level in mother's milk is extremely low
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:08.080]  as far as fluoride is concerned extremely low 0.004 parts per million this means the body thinks
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:13.360]  it's bad and is it is designed to filter it absolutely um this means a bottle-fed baby
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:20.960]  in austin or any other town that's fluoridated is getting 250 times more fluoride than nature
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:26.240]  intended but but what about the studies that that show a 10 to 20 it's in that spectrum
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:32.080]  if if a young mammal this is rats guinea pigs humans rhesus monkeys are given it there's an
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:37.680]  overall IQ reduction of 10 to 20 points i mean this is devastating well these are studies from
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:44.880]  mainly from china they've been about 18 from china another one from iran in mexico and um
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:53.040]  uh india and yes they have found a luring of iq associated with fairly moderate exposure like
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:59.520]  1.9 parts per million and i went to the two china villages in china where they establish
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:06.720]  that level so if you're luring iq at 1.9 parts per million in a study group of a few hundred kids
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:12.960]  you don't have anywhere near an adequate margin of safety to protect the whole well many u.s cities
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:17.760]  have two three four the average is what about one part per million and again from from i mean
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:21.200]  studying fluoride on the periodic table you correct me if i'm wrong isn't this one of the
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:25.440]  worst things to bioaccumulate i mean it's really good at that well now you have to distinguish
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:30.560]  between fluorine which is the most reactive element on the periodic table and fluoride
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:36.800]  which is the compound which in in in terms of chemistry it's lost all its fury you know it's
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:42.080]  a fairly stable this is like comparing chlorine gas which everyone knows toxic chlorine in your
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:47.520]  pool at you and sodium fluoride which is common salt so that's what it means to compare fluorine
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:53.440]  with fluoride but the catcher and the real worrying thing is that fluoride is extremely
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:59.520]  active biologically stay there that's what dr blalock says he says it ties in and boost everything
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:04.960]  else we'll be right back are the threats of a biological attack to the u.s real if biological

[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:24.240]  specific fluoride question for dr connet it's one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:30.080]  one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one to get you up and on the air okay
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:37.920]  dr connet you got cut off by the break you were talking about sodium fluoride well i mean the term
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:45.040]  you use is the same one that medical doctors have used here explain that uh sorry very reactive yes
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:50.800]  the sodium fluoride is not chemically reactive but the fluoride ion is extremely biologically
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:57.440]  active it interferes with enzymes g proteins you name it it strikes at the very heart of biology
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:03.440]  and that's probably why nature in her wisdom has kept it very low in mother's milk and we in our
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:10.160]  foolishness are giving babies now 250 times more fluoride than nature intended foolishness it is it
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:16.080]  is foolish and they know though and they're doing it one of the things we all agree upon is that babies
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:22.240]  of one year of age should not get a fluoride so they are actually warning that age that's right
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:25.840]  you and others have forced the american dental association what five years ago to change course
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:32.000]  yeah they are saying don't use tap water fluoridated tap water to make up formula but they're not
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:37.280]  telling the parents so alice can you help us with we need to get every water department in the country
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:43.280]  that's fluoridated to warn parents not to use see doctor and i want to give you the floor here
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:47.040]  because you're the scientist i want you to go over the science and i want to shut up yeah okay because
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:51.440]  you've got to leave to go talk to the city council people yeah or i'd go into overdrive today
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:55.280]  and you're coming back for a video interview we're doing oh but but but yeah but but but listen
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:00.400]  five years ago when the american dental association said okay young children shouldn't have this it
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:05.680]  causes dental fluorosis and problems and babies yeah suddenly every major water manufacturer
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:10.720]  of bottled water came out and said fluoride water for kids and it's at several parts per million so
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:16.480]  no people try to say warn kids their answer is no it's good have it yeah so come on but we're not
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:23.360]  going to get into why they're doing it let's continue with the science well this is the first
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:28.080]  step is to make sure whilst we're trying to get fluoride out of the water let's at least warn
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:33.920]  parents not to make up that formula as i said 41 percent of american kids now have dental
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:39.600]  fluorosis and the worst year is that first year for exposure to fluoride but what i'm concerned
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:44.800]  about is that when the baby is born the blood brain barrier is not fully formed and not until
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:50.160]  about a half a year of age so in that first half year the blood brain barrier that would normally
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:57.760]  keep fluoride out of the brain does not and with these iq studies now 23 iq studies i mean what's
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:03.600]  more important to protect children's teeth or to protect their brains uh doctor i have a cbs clip
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:08.320]  where they say mercury is good for children's brains uh but i'm sure that's just an accident i'm sure
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:13.760]  they're just wrong uh but uh again uh mothers everywhere buying the special fluoride water
[02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:20.240]  they say for your baby nursery water it's absolutely obscene just oh but it's an accident yeah yeah
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:28.800]  well you know the national research council came out with this 507 page report in 2006 march of 2006
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:34.160]  and they what they said here they were asked to review the safe drinking water standard
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:39.680]  which is currently set at four parts per million and they looked at all the literature spent three
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:47.600]  years doing it and said the four parts per million is not safe it needs to be lowered ask the EPA who
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:53.920]  paid for this review to do the homework do a risk assessment and come out with a a new safe well
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:57.600]  we've got a long segment coming up but i haven't done it i want to go back specifically to the
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:04.000]  testimony in congress and the numbers of the scientist uh from the EPA itself who and and the
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.720]  food and administration who've who've said get it out yeah these were several unions representing
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:12.960]  all these professionals and i think the total number of members of these unions was something
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:19.920]  like 11 000 but one of the most active unions and this is in washington dc where these regulations
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:26.000]  are being dealt with every day uh they are very much adamantly opposed to fluoridation in fact the
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:31.760]  EPA in washington dc doesn't have fluoridated water they all have bottled water down in the EPA
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:37.840]  and yet the rest of the people in washington dc are having to drink this fluoridated water oh but
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:42.480]  it's an accident i mean all almost all other scientists have seen the numbers in some cases
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:48.960]  over 90 of the unions are are writing letters putting their names to it but then the government
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:52.880]  says not only are we not going to take it out we're going to have all the companies say nursery
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:57.840]  water but you know with fluoride for baby it's you know what's absurd here they just want to help
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:04.480]  doctor yeah the national research council did all the work that was necessary to determine a new
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:10.560]  a new uh safe level for drinking water and they asked the EPA to do that four and a half years ago
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:15.600]  it would take you about half an hour if i showed you what you have to do to join the dots and the
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:20.880]  EPA has not come out with a new standard why is it because they can't do simple arithmetic is it
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:26.320]  because they can't read this no they are scared stiff of crossing swords with the department of
[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:31.760]  health and human services that have had this practice going on for 60 60 which was set up by
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:37.120]  eugenesis for racial hygiene and hitler took the model from that but i know doctor let's come back
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:42.560]  long segment coming up let's get into the science and your plan the book how we get this removed
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:51.600]  we're having success all over the world how we stop them from adding this chemical weapon in the water
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:58.320]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:05.760]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:10.080]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:15.120]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:20.720]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:25.840]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:31.120]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:35.760]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:41.120]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:45.520]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solutions from science

[02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:13.280]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:19.440]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are
[02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:25.760]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:31.760]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent
[02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:36.640]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:41.360]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make
[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:47.120]  the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen
[02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:54.400]  a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd at info wars dot com

[02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:19.280]  on a lighter note before we get back into the hardcore issues and your phone calls
[02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:24.560]  john clees who i'm a big fan of my mother and dad just love him a money python and fish called
[02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:30.000]  wander and all the other great movie fame uh you went to college with him and played soccer with him
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:38.160]  went forward and he was a really enthusiastic soccer player pretty useless all arms and legs
[02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:43.520]  but he did enjoy it and it comes out in some of those multi python sketches so again you
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:49.280]  played uh what positions with him i was in goal and this is the downing college second 11 soccer
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:54.640]  team we weren't much good but we had a lot of fun i just wanted to read you alex the last
[02:33:54.640 --> 02:34:01.440]  sentence before the conclusions of our book it's from jack bason and it was written in 1964 he was
[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:08.160]  a historian at columbia university and he reviewed the fluoride issue and he says one hopes behind
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:15.520]  the fluoride scheme there are politics and selfish business interests the presence of solid ulterior
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:21.920]  motives would restore one's faith in common intelligence in other words this is such an
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:28.960]  irrational policy in here it doesn't work the benefits are topical not systemic there's no
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:34.240]  need to expose every tissue in the body to unknown toxic you don't drink sunscreen
[02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:42.800]  exactly exactly and you know maybe the book is i think it's an easy book to read for most people
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:46.400]  and it's got all the references for those that need them we're going to carry it too but you've
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:52.880]  got it available uh give us the website um you can go to chelseagreen.com that's the publisher
[02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:59.840]  chelseagreen.com there's also another uh you can find links at fluorideaction the fluoridealert.org
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:05.840]  and you're also going to be speaking in a pretty big auditorium uh tonight um and you can find out
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:11.440]  at fluoridealert.org all about it houston tillerson houston tillerson the big black college in east
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:16.160]  austin plenty of parking nice facility uh over there and what time is that tonight that's seven
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:21.120]  o'clock and it's very important because black children are particularly sensitive to fluoride
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:27.920]  oh accident higher rates of dandelferosis amongst black children than white children part of it
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:32.720]  may be lactose intolerance well doctor i've also seen the studies about uh not just bone cancer but
[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:39.040]  but uh association with other bone disorders association with problems in joints uh bones
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:44.640]  fracturing that's right uh uh in in rat studies causing organ problems this is just a wonderful
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:50.640]  ambrosia yeah absolutely we know that 50 at least 50 percent of the fluoride and more in children
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:57.360]  is absorbed by the bone each day and as it continues to concentrate in the bone it causes
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:02.720]  symptoms just like arthritis we have one in three american adults now with arthritis and if you ask
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:07.520]  a doctor doc what causes arthritis they say well we don't really know but we think it's got something
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:16.640]  to do with aging well aging in the united states it runs parallel to living 10 20 30 40 50 60 years
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:21.040]  in a fluoridated community by the way people then line say well we live longer now no you don't
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:26.960]  we have lower infant mortality if you go to any old cemetery half the people there are little kids
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:30.960]  we've got old family cemeteries we're literally more than half from like the 18 30s pioneers
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:37.040]  they might have 12 kids half of them die but then you notice almost everybody else 95 years old on
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:42.880]  their tombstone yeah uh so no we're actually living a lot less i would like to also draw your
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:48.000]  attention alex to this videotapes only 20 minutes long 28 minutes long 15 professional
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:54.080]  professionals including three of the authors of the national research council report two
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:37:01.040]  former epa scientists one who testified before congress a Nobel prize winner dentists who had
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:06.640]  previously promoted for adhesion and have changed their mind 28 minutes and i think by the time
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:12.160]  people have watched this it's easy 28 years they will be appalled they we forgot to turn
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:16.080]  your headphones off uh on so they're gonna be crawling around on the floor i i notice them
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:20.320]  like wolves we always have to do it once we're on air uh no i'm just joking uh they're gonna
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:24.080]  crawl in a doctor and turn that on but but sing put them on in a few minutes and we can take
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:28.080]  calls but you've got the floor talk about the health problems the studies what we know this is
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:32.080]  doing and how we get it removed because you're a busy guy you're giving a speech tonight you're
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:37.280]  coming back here to be interviewed you're passionate uh and uh you are also going to speak to a city
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:42.400]  council person uh here uh at about two thirties while you've got to leave so so go over what we
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:47.680]  know what's doing medically uh the things that it attacks on the body and where this is going
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:53.440]  well we can expect it to attack everywhere because it hits at the heart of of biology when it inhibits
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:59.040]  enzymes and plays around with g proteins but we are concerned about the damage to the brain
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:04.800]  damage to the endocrine system it accumulates in the pineal gland it appears to low melatonin
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:11.120]  you know melatonins are like a biological clock uh turning on events so we are concerned about
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:18.080]  the earlier onset of puberty maybe partly related to fluoride exposure when after the arthritic
[02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:22.960]  symptoms of fluoride poisoning of the bones the bones become more brittle so we're worried about
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:28.080]  increased hip fractures in the elderly i mean there are so many things the trouble is that
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:33.360]  when you go through this list people as uh they listen to all this list of potential
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:38.160]  dangers and they throw up their hands as always impossible that's not possible that one substance
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:42.720]  could cause all these problems well of course it is possible and it's the one substance the government
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:48.720]  added to the water but because they care yeah we've never used the public water supply to deliver
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:55.280]  any other medication since 1945 and the reason is simple you can't control the dose you can't
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:39:00.400]  control who gets it there's no individual supervision by a doctor it's immoral to force
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:05.040]  medicaid but now they're promoting dr lithium in the water i statins in the water this is crazy
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:10.080]  this will make us could behave but notice the people the way people are reacting no no no
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:15.600]  they say no to lithium and no to statins but yes yes yes to to fluoride even how it works
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:23.120]  top well that's because i went to uh margaret uh sanger uh school in dallas when i was a little
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:28.080]  kid in in the first grade you know we all know about margaret sanger the eugenicist and we were
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:32.400]  all they they came in several times a year gave us the little pills i always felt sick after i took
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:38.560]  them and had a little cartoon character showed us film reels about mr fluoride wants to help us
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:44.640]  and so people are for 50 plus years are sat down in front of film reels and taught mr fluoride is
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:49.600]  going to help you yeah yep and you know toothpaste has been one of the ways that most people have
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:55.440]  thought that fluoride is is good for teeth but you notice the fda that has done nothing the food and
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:40:01.440]  drug administration has done nothing to regulate fluoridation or test fluoride for ingestion has
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:07.360]  a warning on the back of the tube of toothpaste it says only use a p-sized amount if you accidentally
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:13.760]  swallow more than that get medical attention or contact a poison control center well somebody's
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:19.760]  worked out that a p-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste contains a quarter of a milligram
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:26.640]  of fluoride which you would get in one glass of water could you imagine the fda requiring that
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:32.560]  sign above the tap don't drink more than one glass of water hey guys uh i should have told
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:37.200]  you this before the show i apologize but i know i've shown tubes of toothpaste on air from just a
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:42.800]  year ago it said that now they've changed it where it makes no sense uh so they've actually removed
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:47.600]  that it just talks about poison control and don't swallow but they've taken the p-sized
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:51.840]  common away because it was waking so many people up but the point is a normal glass one part per
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:57.040]  million has the same amount as what's in the p-sized p-sized amount absolutely absolutely and this
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:02.160]  is where monty python comes in could you imagine over every tap there would be the same warning
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:08.720]  if you drink more than one glass of water a day uh then contact the poison control center keep going
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:13.840]  doc i'm going to show some people some floor right here so i think that the the concern here is that
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:20.000]  we are not being protected by any of our federal regulations on this the epa is not doing its job
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:27.600]  in determining a new safe level the fda is never regulated fluoride for ingestion and the cdc promotes
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:32.560]  it and has got a conflict of interest when they turn around and tell everybody it's safe guys we
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:39.200]  got a document cam shot well somebody zoom in on this h eb baby and and it says purified water
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:46.720]  and and it's it's uh with fluoride added so for five years the government admits do not
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:51.280]  give fluoride water to babies yeah it goes through their blood brain barrier it causes dental
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:56.720]  fluorosis with the teeth that haven't erupted yet but then magically there's this big campaign by
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:03.680]  literally hundreds of manufacturers oh it's for the baby purified water with added fluoride
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:10.800]  don't you tell a mother that she's been doing wrong in the past give that baby oh look junior
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:17.680]  juniors not gonna be you know juniors you may have 150 iq juniors gonna be digging ditches and
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:23.840]  lucky if he can i mean but hey it's a gift you know yeah i mean what's wrong with brain damaging
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:29.680]  babies it's look it's a little baby right there on the cover doctor i know it's good look at it
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:35.840]  does the child look happy it's it's hard to remember back alex but in the 1940s before
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:41.760]  fluoridation began fluoride had caused more damage to agriculture the fluoride as a pollutant
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:47.920]  had caused more damage to agriculture than any other pollutant and this was part fluoridation
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:53.280]  according to chris brison at least is part of the if you like the rehabilitation of fluoride
[02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:59.440]  as a nice nice substance not a nasty substance ruining agriculture crippling cattle poisoning
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:04.800]  vegetation but it was safe enough to give it to your little kitties and brush on your teeth oh
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:10.080]  that's another issue i've seen all these vets on youtube you know veterinarians and they talk about
[02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:14.320]  whenever they have droughts out in colorado in other areas they will then pump municipal water
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:19.440]  out to the feedlots and the cows hair starts falling out they start dying and so the farmers
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:23.600]  have figured out man you don't give fluoridated water to a cow but look it doesn't matter if i
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:29.200]  show people a document cam shot if i just draw a little smiley face right there and a little smiley
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:34.400]  eyes yes yeah i mean it's it's it's it's friendly i mean i'm sorry go ahead but talking about animals
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:40.720]  there's an amazing videotape called poisoned horses and this is about kathy justices horses in
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:48.960]  pagosa springs colorado she and her husband bred show horses quarter horses that won 52 ribbons
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:54.320]  and then they fluoridated their water and unfortunately the their horses drank that water
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:44:00.720]  their health completely collapsed they lost eight horses and four dogs and they love those horses
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:04.960]  and they looked after them like other people they have no children i've seen it and their hair is
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:12.240]  falling out it's awful awful i mean and the late lanard crook um uh veterinarian from cornell
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:19.200]  university the world's leading authority on fluorosis in cattle documents that they had
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:25.760]  fluorosis the teeth the bones he measured the fluoride in their bones and declared categorically
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:32.400]  these animals had fluorosis incredible doctor so where do we go from here i mean people should
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:37.520]  be up in arms you know with the pitchforks and torches not literally but metaphorically going
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:42.320]  down to city council since and you and the smiley face mayor laughs at you say look i know this city
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:47.600]  has been lobbying and given a lot of money to fluoridate stop it yeah because tell folks where
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:52.880]  the fluoride comes from the floor it's the a wet scrub and scrubbing liquor from the super
[02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:58.000]  phosphate fertilized industry they had to put a spray of water on to collect these toxic gases
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:04.400]  and those toxic gases get converted into hexafluorosilicic acid they cannot dump that stuff into the
[02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:11.600]  sea by international law it's too concentrated to dump locally but if someone buys it from them
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:18.560]  it stops being a hazardous waste and it becomes a product and the people that are buying this
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:24.320]  conveniently are the public water people so once they buy it it's a product and now they can put
[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:29.040]  into our drinking water which they're not allowed to put into the sea and of course it has a whole
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:34.080]  bunch of other crap in there in addition to that's what i was gonna i've had uh you know the famous
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:38.960]  deniston i forget his name you'll probably remember it i'm back uh uh from from from canada
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:44.560]  he was the guy who lobbied decades ago and was the face of let's get fluoridated and then he
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:48.800]  finally was sent to literature wait this isn't just sodium fluoride i thought it was calcium fluoride
[02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:53.760]  this is hundreds of other chemicals under the name fluoride right right absolutely so what other
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:58.480]  goodies are in there for the children well they mine the same rock for uranium so we have to worry
[02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:04.160]  about radioactive isotope oh well that's good for you and but the one of particular concern is arsenic
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:09.680]  because according to the epa there's no safe level of arsenic and so if you're adding a chemical to
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:14.720]  the water and it contains arsenic which it does then you're going to increase the cancer rate
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:20.400]  we can argue about how much it increases the cancer rate but as we also arguing about how little
[02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:27.440]  benefit it is to swallow fluoride as far as teeth is concerned so for a small if any benefit to teeth
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:33.440]  we are risking increasing the risk of cancer amongst our population another bizarre twist
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:38.400]  you know i'm going to do a youtube bit uh where i'm going to i'll spit it out later where i'm
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:43.440]  going to drink or maybe i'll put milk in so it's fake i'm going to drink uh because i'm going to
[02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:47.840]  say oh it's a sunny day you know maybe at the beach and i'm going to take a big thing of say
[02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:52.080]  copper tone and i'm going to drink it yeah i'm going to go what that's what i do with fluoride
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:58.000]  you know if uh i don't put it topically on my teeth i i you know i i drink it so it must be
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:04.800]  for my skin too i'll i'll i'll i'll drink the uh the uh copper tone yeah suntan lotion to protect
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:09.920]  these the skin and that's what we're doing with because it works topically and it's not us that
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:16.480]  are saying that this is the sense of disease control in 1999 said whoops we made a big mistake
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:22.240]  we thought the babies had to swallow this before their teeth are erupted we were wrong it worked
[02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:28.400]  the predominant mechanism it works from the outside of the tooth so why is everybody swallowing it
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:33.680]  and exposing their whole bodies to it and our baby's brains do it when they could just be brushing
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:37.840]  on the teeth and spitting uh doctor you think the government uh wanted to help the children
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:44.160]  they shot up with syphilis and Guatemala uh what about the black people or or or what about the
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:49.920]  un caught this year shooting kids up with live polio oh it's an accident too just like the fluoride
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:54.080]  well of course i have their own documents in my film in game and i'll just say it on record i
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:58.480]  like the fact you just stick to the science uh but we have their quotes how they're killing us
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:03.040]  and they think it's a big joke too it's very funny to them well let me tell us go closer to home on
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:09.680]  this the gentleman that was the chief toxicologist of the manhattan project a guy called harold hodge
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:15.520]  who was the number one promoter of the safety of fluoridation from the 1940s through to the
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:23.200]  practically the 1980s also was part of the team that injected plutonium into patients at rochester
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:28.480]  medical school without their knowledge but plutonium is good for babies maybe we should
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:33.760]  put it in the water well i mean it did come on somebody who didn't have qualms about injecting
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:38.240]  plutonium no sir i look i got john b holdren's book right here about putting sterilants in the
[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:45.920]  water yeah really oh my goodness very very nice person he's the white house science are yeah but
[02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:50.880]  again maybe i shouldn't read this it's a little scary uh i mean he wrote it but you know in the
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:56.480]  largest study alex the largest study ever done in the united states to look at tooth decay as a
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:03.840]  function of fluoride looked at 39 000 children in 84 communities and the best that they could come up
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:08.640]  with in the difference between a child that had lived all its life in a fluoridated or all its life
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:16.720]  in a non fluoridated was a saving of 0.6 of one tooth surface out of 128 tooth surfaces in a child's
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:25.520]  mouth and if you adjust the data for the delayed eruption in teeth caused by fluoride there is
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:30.480]  absolutely no difference into but that's worth having a 20 point IQ reduction in
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:35.200]  well i don't think it's 20 points so the studies i've seen is 10 to 20 it runs again
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:41.920]  in this chinese study i referred to before the levels in the water with 2.5 to 4.5 and that was
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:49.280]  a 5 to 10 IQ drop but they extrapolated that this drop would begin at about 1.9 parts per million
[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:54.400]  but that was with the small study groups if you took in the whole exposure range and sensitivity
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:59.200]  but people people need to not think too much you know we're going to skip this final breaks we
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:03.600]  have time to take a few calls dr connet i'm really impressed with the work you've done i hope folks
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:07.680]  will get your book the case against fluoride and it's in bookstores too it's in bookstores you can
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:14.400]  get it from amazon.com i think you're gonna carry it um yeah it's it's we've tried to write a book
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:21.520]  which is easy to read or for a fairly intelligent person but if you are qualified if you're a doctor
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:26.320]  if you're dentists if you're a scientist then all the references there's there's not a single
[02:50:26.320 --> 02:50:30.800]  by the way people should buy this book and in-game and other things and give it to doctors give it
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:35.920]  to dentists and say look instead of believing what the AMA or you know uh different groups are telling
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:41.440]  you or or the american dental association read this know the facts and any scientist or doctor that
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:45.520]  looks at this wakes up you know my dad's a dentist and it about 10 years ago he actually looked at
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:49.360]  literature and said i guess you're right about this fluoride stuff but don't give it to them alex
[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:54.240]  lend it to them there's no reason why uh you should give anything to a doctor or dentist they're
[02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:59.280]  earning a lot of money so lend it to them by all means but people don't appreciate things they get
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:04.240]  for nothing so i thought i should encourage them either to buy it or lend it i don't know we give
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:08.560]  our films away when they're number one so but i mean you're probably right i mean they should
[02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:11.760]  but you know they they'd rather just go play golf of course they might want to know why their
[02:51:11.760 --> 02:51:15.440]  sons and daughters aren't as smart as them i mean maybe they think that's kind of cute hey
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:19.840]  junior can't really talk and he's eight years old like a lot of kids now but that's just freedom
[02:51:19.840 --> 02:51:24.560]  you know fight all god i drink fluoride uh let's talk to ted oh go ahead put your headphones on
[02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:29.760]  there doc thank you uh how's the audio there sound good i can't get anything at the moment
[02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:33.760]  it's silence all right we'll see if you can hear a caller uh ted in texas you're on the
[02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:39.920]  ear go ahead ted all right thanks for taking my call dr connet i have a science question for
[02:51:39.920 --> 02:51:45.760]  you and then maybe a general question for both of you um let's see an audio we're getting his audio
[02:51:45.760 --> 02:51:50.640]  turned up we needed it was fine okay go ahead now sir go ahead and ask your question all right
[02:51:50.640 --> 02:51:58.560]  dr connet um in austin i'd like to see if uh if you could use austin as an example with just pure
[02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:07.280]  science on this um to say uh austin says that uh their fluoride is 0.5 parts parts per million
[02:52:07.280 --> 02:52:13.360]  and i was just wondering uh what you would say um as how long it would take to bioaccumulate when
[02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:21.520]  that would be harmful at 0.5 and then uh for both you guys you know uh on the austin city of website
[02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:26.960]  it says you know the cdc is recognized waterfall organization is one of the 10 great public health
[02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:32.960]  achievement for the 20th century so with uh with people saying that have there been positive
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:37.840]  results no it's all propaganda ted i appreciate your call let's get a comment yeah i was very
[02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:42.880]  interested i met bill kyle from alamo height so they they stopped fluoridating there or didn't start
[02:52:42.880 --> 02:52:48.960]  fluoridation there one of the things that bill kyle told me just a few days ago was when the
[02:52:48.960 --> 02:52:53.600]  citizen asked him to look at the literature he didn't go to the anti-fluoridation literature he
[02:52:53.600 --> 02:52:59.600]  went to the pro-fluoridation literature and he decided as a professional geophysicist who's held
[02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:04.560]  headed up research laboratories for shell oil company he said it was so much junk it was just
[02:53:04.560 --> 02:53:10.880]  clearly propaganda so it was the pro-fluoridation literature that convinced him that fluoridation
[02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:17.920]  was unacceptable and they managed to keep it out of alamo heights yes this sense of disease controls
[02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:22.000]  statement that fluoridation one of the top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century as
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:27.280]  alex says total propaganda it was written by two people a guy that had never written anything on
[02:53:27.280 --> 02:53:33.360]  fluoridation before and an economist two people from the oral health division in this paper that
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:38.400]  supported the statement they were six years out of date on the health literature they cited a review
[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:44.960]  from 1993 their evidence that fluoridation worked was pitiful they showed a graph showing the
[02:53:46.240 --> 02:53:51.600]  tooth decay in 12 yards coming down between the 60s and the 90s and on the same graph a line going
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:56.080]  up suggesting the percentage of the population tree but doctor in fact he won't believe it guys
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:54:00.000]  queue up we're gonna do five minutes into overdrive only five minutes because he's got to go after
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:06.640]  that queue up news says mercury is good for children's brains this was a national cbs piece
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:11.440]  but but they also covered it locally and so it's perception management next they're going to say
[02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:16.000]  cyanide is good yeah and next they're going to say when you're dead that you're really still alive
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:20.880]  like oh he's in the ground now but he's down there happy they know what they're doing doctor that's
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:26.480]  exactly you know the american dental association published an article shortly after they found an
[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:32.800]  increase in osteosarcoma in in the communities were florida in the united states in an animal study
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:38.720]  and that they published an article which says oh guess what fluoridation is actually protective
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:44.960]  against osteosarcoma so that's just an industrial trick if you come out with a problem they come
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:49.440]  out with a study which says the exact opposite they did the same thing with hipfrag just studies
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:54.000]  which and now mercury one of the most tested things ever correct me if i'm wrong as a toxic
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:57.680]  college is i mean they've been testing that for hundreds of years and now in fact we have the
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:02.720]  clip of them saying mercury is good for you here is incredible here here is no i mean this is
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:07.600]  taught in schools now they actually now if you go to the local health food store because they said this
[02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:12.240]  i have vitamins in there that i bought that actually says mercury yes i'm not kidding the
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:17.680]  that's incredible here it is here it is mercury containing vaccines may have on kids a life-saving
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:22.720]  device wins over the counter approval by the fda and sick of your glasses and contact lenses and
[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:27.440]  new corrective eye surgery is approved today here's tonight's medical headlines with medical
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:35.280]  watch reporters in the matter mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:40.400]  two new studies in the journal pediatric there have been widespread concerns that mercury-based
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:44.960]  preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children these
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:49.440]  new studies suggest that the opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:54.000]  improved behavior and mental performance okay so for them improved performance is being brain
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:58.400]  damaged now let me expand now they admit they want the lithium to make us more manageable
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:02.720]  now now expanding on that doctor um i could play the clip but we're almost out of time
[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:07.280]  when we go to more calls i have the news clips where they came out china executed people for
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:14.240]  melamine and milk i have the fda now saying melamine doesn't hurt children and might be good
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:19.920]  incredible you know it's a total schizophrenia on on organic mercury you know the concern we're
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:25.200]  we're concerned about trash incinerators power stations dental offices putting mercury into
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:29.920]  the environment the concern is that the mercury will eventually get into the sediments of the great
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:35.760]  of the lakes and be converted to organic mercury accumulate up the food chain and we are concerned
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:42.160]  about women eating pregnant women eating the large fish and getting this organic mercury
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:47.360]  into their babies and on the other half of the american government they are injecting
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:54.400]  organic mercury directly into the baby's bloodstream at one point a hundred times yes the
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:57:00.800]  level the total that was safe to eat but they said it's good for their brain doctor everybody
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:05.680]  knows mercury i think that's an absolute classic case of what i was talking about no i mean that
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:10.560]  look they know what they're doing well i mean you talked about it you know at the at the epa
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:17.440]  that they only have filtered water you know one of the the guys that was quoted a lot a danish guy
[02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:24.080]  who's quoted by the cdc to say that thymus olin in vaccine was no problem i think he came out he
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:30.000]  absconded with about a million dollars of the research money so uh yeah there's a lot of corruption
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:33.840]  let's let's jam one more call and we're going to come back with five more minutes uh let's talk to
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:39.200]  rick in new york you're on the air with dr paul connick go ahead yes sir keep up the good work
[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:44.720]  at it yesterday in the timeshore record middle town new york they had a story uh about taking
[02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:50.720]  the fluoride pills that they get the children every day for the last uh for years and stop giving
[02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:56.800]  them the fluoride pills they get in the big industrial size uh bottles and just uh one
[02:57:56.800 --> 02:58:02.400]  breaking news story about the the cnn right now and they've been talking about barry sataro's
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:06.720]  uh going to school that was the name he used it all day long they've been mentioned that i feel
[02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:11.520]  i'd let you know that else well finally coming out yeah what about these fluoride pills doc i mean

[03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:28.800]  gonna start wearing a kim suit to the supermarket for a non-organic protest my question is about the
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:35.200]  pineal gland i've read all the chinese and the european studies um if you go to google and google
[03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:41.040]  pineal cadaver it'll be the third link it's a it's called fluoride deposition in the aged human
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:47.680]  immune gland yeah um does it artificially age it and calcify calcify this what does it do to the
[03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:52.560]  pineal gland uh doc it accumulates in the pineal it's like a magnet for fluoride it has the heart
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:57.920]  the pineal gland in these study that this gentleman's referring to has the highest concentration of
[03:01:57.920 --> 03:02:01.840]  fluoride than any other and that's called the seed of the soul i mean that's a seed of the soul the
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:09.120]  third eye it makes melatonin but only at night and melatonin controls all kinds of timed events from
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:15.280]  aging sleep patterns oh and of course they knew that oh they care about us and nobody has attempted
[03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:20.640]  to reproduce this study by jennifer luke who i've met we've we've given her phd thesis to
[03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:27.920]  health agencies in this country they haven't attempted to reproduce it or uh either of her
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:34.000]  studies yeah but attacking the core of your of your brain is a loving thing yeah now it's absolutely
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:40.960]  amazing how utterly irresponsible they are they give every indication of working backwards this
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:49.040]  project this practice this program appears to be more important to them to protect than our children
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:53.680]  and that is extraordinary and that explains they were protecting kids in guatemala shooting them up
[03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:58.000]  with syphilis i mean come on doc come on now you're gonna tell me syphilis is bad i mean
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:04.720]  he's gonna tell me mercury's bad this guy's crazy we're nuts i admit it i'm a screwball man
[03:03:04.720 --> 03:03:11.440]  it's great to calcify your pineal gland you're so hard to convince alex is uh we're gonna jam
