[00:00.000 --> 00:08.160]  All Info Warriors, anyone in the Northeast, anybody in the Midwest who go to Pittsburgh
[00:08.160 --> 00:13.820]  now with video cameras that troops are bought and paid for by offshore banks, Republic is
[00:13.820 --> 00:18.960]  falling right now, they are openly bringing in Marshall Nell, they have trips deploying
[00:18.960 --> 00:24.080]  in every major city, we need everybody to go to Pittsburgh who loves this country.
[00:24.080 --> 00:31.200]  All immediate government staffers and protesters. The G20 basically represent the largest nations
[00:31.200 --> 00:36.240]  which participate in the western banking cartel which I feel is behind a lot of deep
[00:36.240 --> 00:41.120]  pain, anguish and misery that exists in our world today. This is such a police state there
[00:41.120 --> 00:45.040]  that they tried to talk to the military and talk to a spokesman last night, defense link
[00:45.040 --> 00:49.120]  put a press release out and they said no we're not going to talk to you get out of here,
[00:49.120 --> 00:54.240]  then they got their license number, had the police pose as Alamo rental car people from
[00:54.240 --> 01:00.160]  the county there, Allegheny County in Pennsylvania, they called them and said oh your car's got
[01:00.160 --> 01:05.120]  no brakes, bring it in and they said well we're in the cordon at G20, we're news reporters,
[01:05.120 --> 01:08.960]  we can't get out till tomorrow and they said well that's fine because I'm a police officer
[01:08.960 --> 01:13.280]  with the Army and FBI and you've all been put on terror list and your life's over boy,
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.680]  we know you're a terrorist and you were sneaking around the military base and ran, all lies.
[01:17.680 --> 01:22.160]  Okay so I just went over, they're gonna have a guy come out and talk to us or they said
[01:22.160 --> 01:26.960]  they'll get us a number to contact, he said the PAO, this is probably him right here.
[01:27.920 --> 01:31.760]  Briefly tell folks about last night, you guys pull up to the gate,
[01:31.760 --> 01:35.920]  you asked to talk to the public information officer, they called the police and lied
[01:35.920 --> 01:41.600]  and said that you were sneaking around. Yes sir, how's it going? We were responding
[01:41.600 --> 01:46.320]  to a news story that the National Guard was going to be masked to go into Pittsburgh and
[01:46.320 --> 01:49.760]  could we get a comment on that? We then pulled off to the side of the road where they instructed
[01:49.760 --> 01:54.640]  us to, we made it around 15 or 20 minutes, our representative came back immediately,
[01:54.640 --> 01:58.480]  he was hostile towards us, he did not like our credentials. And we're out of Austin,
[01:58.480 --> 02:03.680]  Texas Channel 10? Okay, can I see your credentials? We tried to get as much information as we could
[02:03.680 --> 02:07.760]  here with you to answer our questions so then Rob asked him for his information and where we
[02:07.760 --> 02:13.040]  could contact him tomorrow and we could get a word with him, he then gave it and we left.
[02:13.040 --> 02:18.240]  Expeach, Freelance, Reporter, you guys have credentials for the G20? I can't,
[02:18.240 --> 02:21.200]  the middle of the night you come here tomorrow we'll see what we can do if we can accommodate you.
[02:21.200 --> 02:24.320]  I mean we only got a few questions now. Yeah we just have like four questions.
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.040]  The answer's no, I'm not going to comment, no I'm not, that's okay. If you get some
[02:29.040 --> 02:33.440]  credentials you get some that I can work with, I'll do it. We didn't run away from anything,
[02:33.440 --> 02:38.480]  by the time that we had left turned around and exited the main military facility there was
[02:38.480 --> 02:44.640]  another car parked on the other side of the road, waited for us past, followed us for an exit,
[02:44.640 --> 02:51.120]  then got off and then we were shot when Douglas got a call trying to entrap him and had us go
[02:51.120 --> 02:57.360]  return our rental car for quote unquote two more free days. When we didn't fall for that he then
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.080]  came clean and said he was actually a military personnel and he wanted to know whether or not
[03:02.080 --> 03:06.560]  we were terrorists, Allen. And then he told Douglas you're on a list now, pal, for the rest of your
[03:06.560 --> 03:13.280]  life. He did. With pleasure, you ran from them, is that true? Absolutely not.
[03:22.080 --> 03:28.240]  Good evening, my fellow America. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry
[03:28.240 --> 03:35.680]  of basketball court. Public policy, but itself, has become the captive of a scientific,
[03:35.680 --> 03:44.320]  technological elite. Tarani is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:54.720 --> 03:58.960]  They said the market would drop by 4,000 points. Blood would flow in the streets
[03:59.520 --> 04:03.680]  and the alliance would be devouring children in the parks of Los Angeles.
[04:03.680 --> 04:10.560]  Same story, it's just FBI training, but it was being used to believe that the military
[04:10.560 --> 04:36.560]  would fire on its feet and fire on its legs. Are we turning this out well enough? Complete control.
[04:40.560 --> 05:03.520]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June
[05:03.520 --> 05:08.720]  of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps the
[05:08.720 --> 05:13.040]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem
[05:13.040 --> 05:17.600]  to be getting worse. Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their long
[05:17.600 --> 05:22.080]  expected journey to the moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and
[05:22.080 --> 05:27.120]  silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect. They both make fabulous
[05:27.120 --> 05:32.560]  investments. Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial
[05:32.560 --> 05:38.000]  resource. You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.200]  metals. Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save
[05:43.200 --> 05:47.440]  for long term. This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it. Visit

[06:47.440 --> 06:56.560]  We're dancing like a marionette. We're swaying to the symphony of destruction.
[07:00.560 --> 07:04.880]  Wacking like a robot. It's metal brain corrodes.
[07:06.960 --> 07:09.280]  It's metal brain corrodes.
[07:09.280 --> 07:31.520]  We are seeing a globalist launched worldwide destabilization campaign planned for close to
[07:31.520 --> 07:41.520]  five decades as the rats are being turned loose. So the population will beg the pied piper.
[07:43.520 --> 07:49.520]  And the point I was making back during the last break about the liberty movement. All of you that
[07:49.520 --> 07:53.760]  have warned your friends and family and been laughed at, the people that laughed at Ron Paul
[07:53.760 --> 07:58.320]  three years ago, the people that pilloried this broadcast and attacked us from every level.
[07:58.320 --> 08:05.680]  When I talk about don't give me this power, it is daunting to know that we are one of the leading
[08:05.680 --> 08:11.200]  salvos, one of the leading spears fighting the globalists that are aware of their program.
[08:11.200 --> 08:17.280]  We know the attack profile. We've been proven right so many times that all of us who know the
[08:17.280 --> 08:24.480]  score have incredible responsibilities. I do. You do. The Genesis Network. Everyone does.
[08:24.480 --> 08:30.160]  Other talk show hosts listening right now. This is so real. This is so big. What's happening in
[08:30.160 --> 08:39.440]  the world right now. And they have begun the dominoes to fall for global destabilization
[08:40.480 --> 08:48.400]  to create a crisis so horrible that the public will beg for world government. And I do not like
[08:48.400 --> 08:54.960]  the fact that I'm so prominent. I can feel the danger increasing. But it's a responsibility.
[08:54.960 --> 09:00.000]  And I passed the point of no return a long time ago. And so did you. Because even if you try to
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.840]  serve this system, folks, it's going to destroy you. So once you realize you don't really have a
[09:03.840 --> 09:08.320]  choice, you've got to fight it with every ounce of energy, with every bit of intellect, with your
[09:08.320 --> 09:15.200]  heart, with your soul, with everything. I just pray that God lead God and direct us and that we
[09:15.200 --> 09:20.240]  repent for the things we've done, the decadence. The globalists have sold us corruption to make
[09:20.240 --> 09:25.280]  us weak, to make us rotten inside. None of us are perfect. But we need to get our hearts right with
[09:25.280 --> 09:31.040]  God. We need to all of us get our hearts right with God because the crises that we're already in,
[09:31.040 --> 09:37.600]  the crises that are that are expanding and getting worse by the day are going to be used to try to
[09:37.600 --> 09:45.920]  usher in planetary despotism, planetary enslavement. And I want people listening to realize
[09:45.920 --> 09:50.880]  the incredible historical crossroads that we all stand at the fulcrum of.
[09:54.160 --> 10:00.000]  What we do now will echo throughout human civilization. Don't be a spectator. Be involved.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.920]  People aren't going to laugh at you now when you warn them. Many people who have been laughed at in
[10:03.920 --> 10:07.920]  the past, just average folks out there, tell me their friends, their family are listening now,
[10:07.920 --> 10:15.600]  and that is so positive. I am risking my life, my name, my treasure, everything because corruption
[10:15.600 --> 10:19.840]  must be faced. It must be dealt with or it will grow like a cancer out of control.
[10:21.520 --> 10:27.280]  And so if you look at this at a one-dimensional view, it's like, oh great, a thug's being thrown out.
[10:28.240 --> 10:32.240]  But when you understand, oh good, Ozzy Mubarak's been thrown out, but then you see the very same
[10:32.240 --> 10:38.160]  military people behind him step in, there will be no freedom. This is purely to drive up oil prices,
[10:38.160 --> 10:43.920]  to try to put people, the media can call more extreme into power, and to try to have
[10:45.600 --> 10:50.240]  the buffer zone of the Middle East basically turn into a lake of carnage.
[10:52.880 --> 10:54.880]  Let me cover the news that I'm going to your phone calls.
[10:54.880 --> 11:04.560]  Hundreds protest in Iraq. TV station torched. This out of the Toronto Sun. Hundreds of protesters
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.080]  inspired by unrest around the Arab world. Look to the streets of the northern Iraqi city.
[11:12.880 --> 11:18.960]  On Sunday, and at least 48 people were injured, a police official said security forces fired in
[11:18.960 --> 11:23.680]  the air when demonstrators chanted against corruption, tried to approach the headquarters
[11:23.680 --> 11:28.240]  of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, where clashes on Thursday killed two people and wounded dozens.
[11:28.960 --> 11:31.760]  And it just goes on from there. TV station's been torched.
[11:33.840 --> 11:41.920]  Dealing with the situation in Libya, it is being reported that military aircraft fire
[11:41.920 --> 11:49.200]  at Libyan crowds and Al Jazeera's reporting. Reuters is also reporting that. And these are
[11:49.200 --> 11:53.040]  armed people. They've gotten arms either by taking them from security forces,
[11:53.040 --> 11:57.120]  or they've been prearmed. They've taken tanks. They were trying to take over a military base.
[11:57.120 --> 12:00.960]  When this happened, if you can believe any of this, that does make them a military target.
[12:01.520 --> 12:06.240]  But if you don't think our military has been trained to be trying to take over a military base
[12:06.240 --> 12:10.000]  to kill your dead in the hammer, you've got nothing coming. They're openly training the
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.440]  military. It's even in the Army times, going back two and a half years ago and since then,
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.000]  many times, that they are quote preparing our military to quote pull triggers on the American
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.840]  people. In fact, I read from an Army report that was put out last year, Army strategic shock report
[12:23.840 --> 12:30.400]  says troops may be needed to quell U.S. civil unrest. Purposeful domestic resistance would
[12:30.400 --> 12:35.040]  require military to rapidly determine the parameters, defining the legitimate use of
[12:35.040 --> 12:39.920]  military force inside the United States. We reported that in December 16th, 2008.
[12:40.560 --> 12:47.520]  See, they've all geared up for this. I mean, folks, I was a mainline kind of libertarian
[12:47.520 --> 12:52.240]  style Ron Paul guy. I didn't get into Bohemian Grove and sculling bones and stuff like that.
[12:52.240 --> 12:59.440]  I was just, you know, a mainline libertarian and I got on talk radio and TV 95 radio 96 and
[13:00.080 --> 13:05.200]  people would send me documents, articles. I'd see an article about the police chief being
[13:05.200 --> 13:09.440]  dealt the force trying to pay him off and the San Antonio Express news. I'd call the chief up.
[13:09.440 --> 13:12.880]  Hey, I'm got a local radio show and a TV show in Austin. I'd come interview you.
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.320]  Alex Jones interviews ally, Philippus. It's in my film, police take 2000 show up in his office,
[13:18.320 --> 13:22.560]  have an hour long meeting and he says dealt the force trying to buy off the town and a secret
[13:22.560 --> 13:28.560]  takeover operation that interviewed Thomas Sanchez, emergency manager, Vietnam veteran,
[13:28.560 --> 13:33.360]  former army intelligence. So he knows what he was saying. He was approached. He came on my radio
[13:33.360 --> 13:42.080]  show. He was approached in Kingsville, down in South Texas, basically for martial law takeover drill.
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.600]  And I'd go on air and talk about it. I mean, they've been preparing for at least 15 years
[13:50.880 --> 13:56.480]  at a breakneck speed for the total collapse of the U.S. and in all the training, it's
[13:56.480 --> 14:02.240]  stock market crash, dollar devaluation and then the very banks that run America on record have
[14:02.240 --> 14:07.120]  done all of this. I mean, again, that's what's so frustrating for me. This is a hundred percent.
[14:08.400 --> 14:12.560]  This is a hundred percent. This is not my opinion. We told you all this was coming.
[14:14.320 --> 14:20.080]  I have been dreading this, but now it's at a certain level. I'm almost like, well, at least,
[14:20.080 --> 14:26.320]  you know, we were right, but that's kind of sticky sweet leaves a bad taste in your mouth. But
[14:26.320 --> 14:34.240]  in a way, it's vindication. But then it's, it's just confirmation. And it's, I use the analogy of
[14:34.240 --> 14:40.960]  being 11, 12 years old and getting off the school bus and three or four and having a bunch of times,
[14:41.600 --> 14:48.160]  you know, 14, 15, 16, 17 year olds get around you and beat you up and punch you in the nose. And,
[14:49.040 --> 14:54.480]  you know, you try to fight back a little, but then it made me strong. You know, after it happened
[14:54.480 --> 15:02.080]  dozens of times to the point by the time I was about 13, well, now when the 17 year old came
[15:02.080 --> 15:06.000]  up, I just learned to savagely attack them and start punching them in the nose and doing whatever
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.160]  I can and headbutting them and just turning it loose. You know, it's almost like you're scared
[15:10.160 --> 15:14.240]  when the bullies walking up, but once they go ahead and swing, once they go, once, once you
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.920]  felt them hit you, it's like, boom, it's on. I'm not scared anymore. I'm going to open a can of,
[15:19.920 --> 15:26.480]  you know what, on you. And that which does not kill us only makes us stronger. As Nietzsche said,
[15:26.480 --> 15:29.040]  I don't agree with a lot of what Nietzsche said, but I certainly agree with that,
[15:29.760 --> 15:40.400]  the German philosopher, but I, it's so many emotions right now because this is just another
[15:40.400 --> 15:47.040]  complete total verification of everything we've said. And we know the globalist planned all this
[15:47.040 --> 16:03.920]  and we know what it leaves to next. A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[16:03.920 --> 16:09.120]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.680]  everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.520]  how you take care of your health and your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous
[16:17.520 --> 16:22.480]  predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the
[16:22.480 --> 16:26.800]  collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth
[16:26.800 --> 16:32.400]  Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video
[16:32.400 --> 16:36.640]  which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[16:36.640 --> 16:41.600]  and it's a real eye opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video
[16:41.600 --> 16:45.680]  online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to
[16:45.680 --> 16:52.240]  protect yourself. You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America,

[17:12.960 --> 17:17.600]  are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.

[18:00.240 --> 18:04.560]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[18:04.560 --> 18:08.960]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire
[18:08.960 --> 18:12.560]  function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your Silver

[19:02.320 --> 19:07.440]  buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[19:07.440 --> 19:12.640]  your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[19:12.640 --> 19:17.520]  company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name
[19:17.520 --> 19:22.800]  of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[19:22.800 --> 19:28.080]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[19:28.080 --> 19:33.200]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families
[19:33.200 --> 19:37.760]  lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[19:37.760 --> 19:42.320]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[19:42.320 --> 19:46.720]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at

[20:16.400 --> 20:34.640]  to me. Well, there couldn't be a better time to have the editor and publisher of the GloomBoomDoom
[20:34.640 --> 20:43.040]  Report. GloomBoomDoom.com, economist Mark Fauber. I can't go over his illustrious bio in the time
[20:43.040 --> 20:49.840]  we have the next 25 minutes, but he, of course, graduated at 24 with a PhD in economics at
[20:49.840 --> 20:56.640]  Magna Cum Laude. And he joins us from Thailand today, a real expert on world markets, especially
[20:56.640 --> 21:02.080]  what's happening in Asia. And I've got so much to discuss with him on oil, gold. What's going to
[21:02.080 --> 21:06.080]  happen with the Chinese? Could they dump a bunch of gold in the market where he sees everything
[21:06.080 --> 21:11.040]  going? We have to say his forecasting is among some of the most accurate in the world. Again,
[21:11.040 --> 21:17.600]  GloomBoomDoom.com. Mr. Fauber, good to have you here with us. It's my pleasure. Okay. Well,
[21:17.600 --> 21:22.560]  you've got the floor from Thailand. What in the world is going on right now on this planet? What
[21:22.560 --> 21:31.520]  do you see happening? Well, basically, we have to go back to the 1970s to fully understand what's
[21:31.520 --> 21:38.880]  happened in the 1970s. They printed money in the U.S. and commodity prices went ballistic
[21:38.880 --> 21:46.960]  and they all were shot on the upside because of the money printing. And after 1980,
[21:47.840 --> 21:55.520]  they then declined because as they went up too much, supplies came into the market. So all
[21:55.520 --> 22:06.320]  commodities went down until 1998. During the decline in commodity prices, no new mining was
[22:06.320 --> 22:16.560]  undertaken. No exploration took place. No new oil fields were looked for because as prices went
[22:16.560 --> 22:26.160]  down, there was no economic reason to look for new oil. But then after 1998, commodity prices
[22:26.160 --> 22:35.600]  started to rise. And because of the combination of the opening of China, the incremental demand
[22:35.600 --> 22:42.720]  from China, and also increasingly India, and other emerging economies, commodity prices started
[22:42.720 --> 22:52.000]  to go up. And because of the money printing in the U.S. by this rather despicable character,
[22:52.000 --> 23:00.800]  Mr. Bernanke, they went ballistic. And so we have very high inflation in most countries.
[23:00.800 --> 23:09.520]  And in many countries, this high inflation in food prices, energy prices, has had an impact
[23:09.520 --> 23:19.440]  on the wallet of the typical households. Because whereas in the U.S., we say a per capita income
[23:19.440 --> 23:28.880]  of $40,000, food is not a huge component in people's income in emerging economies,
[23:28.880 --> 23:37.840]  where say the per capita income in Vietnam, India is only $1,000 per year, food and energy
[23:37.840 --> 23:46.800]  makes maybe 50% of people's income. And of course, you're now, I guess, alluding to what we see
[23:46.800 --> 23:52.480]  happening in North Africa. Libya, now it looks like, is basically falling to the rebellion.
[23:52.480 --> 24:00.640]  Or reportedly, the Muammar Gaddafi has fled to Venezuela. What is driving these revolutions
[24:00.640 --> 24:06.160]  that we're seeing popping up around the world? And if it is overall dollar devaluation and
[24:06.160 --> 24:12.640]  commodity increases, how much worse is it going to get? I mean, how bad is the inflation going to get?
[24:12.640 --> 24:27.120]  Well, the really big question is whether the unrest we have in Tunisia, Libya, Bahrain, Egypt
[24:27.840 --> 24:36.320]  will spread to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. If they do, it will be very difficult for the U.S.
[24:36.320 --> 24:44.080]  to take sides, because on the one hand, the U.S. has supported the vicious regime
[24:44.800 --> 24:53.360]  over Mr. Mubarak. They have supported the royal family of Saudi Arabia. They never asked Saudi
[24:53.360 --> 25:06.080]  Arabia to have reform and democracy, whereas they embargo countries like Myanmar. So where will they
[25:06.080 --> 25:18.960]  stand? What can they do? And the CIA is completely useless. They had no idea that the unrest would
[25:18.960 --> 25:27.840]  start. They had no ground information that something was going on. And so the U.S. in particular
[25:27.840 --> 25:37.040]  needs this incapable president that the U.S. has no way to react properly.
[25:39.360 --> 25:43.680]  Mr. Fawber, I mean, looking at this as an economist and as a forecaster,
[25:44.400 --> 25:50.160]  obviously it's spreading. The inflation is intensifying. How bad in the near term and the
[25:50.160 --> 25:54.960]  long term do you see the inflation getting? I know you can't make exact predictions,
[25:54.960 --> 25:59.680]  but what do you see happening to the dollar? What do you see happening to gold, silver,
[25:59.680 --> 26:02.000]  other commodities? I mean, there's skyrocketing right now.
[26:02.560 --> 26:11.600]  Well, I would say the following. I have a large subscriber base. I ask all my subscribers to
[26:11.600 --> 26:20.960]  please send me an email if they have the feeling that their costs of lending were going up by
[26:20.960 --> 26:28.720]  less than 5 percent per annum. I didn't receive a single email. And so I think that the inflation
[26:28.720 --> 26:36.080]  or the cost of living increases in the U.S. and elsewhere is much higher than what the
[26:36.080 --> 26:43.440]  government is publishing. And I think this is having a negative impact on consumption because
[26:43.440 --> 26:53.360]  obviously the cost of necessity, insurance, taxes, food, energy is going up very rapidly.
[26:54.240 --> 27:01.840]  And my answer to all this is the worst the economic conditions will become, the worst
[27:01.840 --> 27:09.840]  the geopolitical conditions will become, the more Mr. Bernanke and his fellow Fed governors
[27:09.840 --> 27:16.240]  will print money. And so I'm not also bearish on equity. I think they will now correct
[27:17.120 --> 27:24.880]  because the market is way overboard. And so we can easily have a correction of 10-15 percent.
[27:25.600 --> 27:33.840]  But I think as soon as the market drops, say, 15-20 percent, QE3 will come into play.
[27:33.840 --> 27:42.320]  And all that is favorable for silver and gold. Now the question is, is gold and silver expensive
[27:42.320 --> 27:55.840]  or is it cheap? Say, in 1990, you could buy an ounce of gold for $252. Now it's $1,400.
[27:55.840 --> 28:02.880]  Is it cheap or expensive? Well, in a money printing environment, it's very difficult to decide what
[28:02.880 --> 28:12.720]  is expensive and what it is cheap because the function of money to be a unit of account and
[28:12.720 --> 28:22.080]  the store value is being lost through the money printing. And so my view would be, yeah, relative
[28:22.080 --> 28:30.560]  to 99, the price of gold is expensive at $1,400. But relative to the money printing, maybe not.
[28:30.560 --> 28:36.880]  And so my advice to all your listeners is to gradually
[28:36.880 --> 28:59.760]  assimilate gold. Don't trade it. Don't buy it or market. Just gradually assimilate.
[29:06.880 --> 29:13.760]  Qualifying purchase. Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.

[29:59.840 --> 30:04.640]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June of
[30:04.640 --> 30:10.640]  2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps the recession ended
[30:10.640 --> 30:14.640]  for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting
[30:14.640 --> 30:19.840]  worse. Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their long expected journey to the
[30:19.840 --> 30:24.480]  moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider

[33:06.000 --> 33:08.000]  Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:36.960 --> 33:46.000]  I know a lot of wealthy people, you know, truly wealthy that I've run into here in Austin. And
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.080]  of course, you obviously have been running about a million times more than I have. We're running in
[33:50.080 --> 33:55.120]  the highest circles. I don't think so, but those will depend on her. But I mean, you know, just
[33:55.120 --> 34:01.120]  running into well-known people off record told me four years ago that the U.S. and the entire world
[34:01.120 --> 34:06.160]  economy was going to collapse via the derivatives and that they were basically fleeing. I mean,
[34:06.160 --> 34:11.760]  I even know about John Wayne, part of his family, just ran off to Central America. I mean, so many
[34:11.760 --> 34:17.840]  people are evacuating some of the richest people in Israel. It's been in the news. They're evacuating
[34:17.840 --> 34:22.480]  Israel. I mean, what do the elite know that the general public hasn't been let in on, doctor?
[34:22.480 --> 34:33.120]  Well, there's another element. Because of the advent of computers, a taxi machine,
[34:34.480 --> 34:42.320]  and in the last 20 years, the internet, if I'm a head fund manager, if I'm a well-to-do person,
[34:42.320 --> 34:48.800]  I can run my business from anywhere. I sit here in the north of Thailand. I have Bloomberg,
[34:48.800 --> 34:56.080]  I have computer access, I have everything. So I don't need to be in a big city. I can choose
[34:56.080 --> 35:04.240]  the lifestyle to be in a small city and have a larger space or to be in the countryside.
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.800]  So that's a big part of the shift. I had a caller earlier who, before you came on, who wanted me
[35:12.800 --> 35:22.080]  to ask you about gold mining supplies versus demand. And could China or some other country or group
[35:22.080 --> 35:27.680]  dump a bunch of gold on the market and really knock it down far? Or is, from what I've read,
[35:27.680 --> 35:31.840]  China is mining a lot, but consuming it and selling it because of demand?
[35:31.840 --> 35:42.160]  Well, first of all, if you look at the international reserve at the hands of central banks
[35:43.520 --> 35:49.600]  and the wealth accumulation over the last 20 years among well-to-do people,
[35:50.480 --> 35:58.160]  the international reserves have grown from one trillion dollars to now nine and a half trillion
[35:58.160 --> 36:05.440]  dollars. The Chinese, they have two and a half trillion. The Asians have 70 percent
[36:06.320 --> 36:16.400]  of the nine and a half trillion. The Asians, they have two percent of these reserves invested in
[36:16.400 --> 36:28.960]  gold. Very little. The Indian, the reserve bank of India bought, yeah, a year ago, 200 tons at roughly
[36:28.960 --> 36:40.400]  $1,040. Now it's $1,400. The Chinese, it's kind of a loss of base for them to go into the open market
[36:40.400 --> 36:48.400]  and buy and announce that they're buying gold. But what they produce, they keep and they have
[36:48.400 --> 36:56.960]  given incentives and create programs in China whereby individuals can now buy gold.
[36:56.960 --> 36:58.160]  So they're bullish on gold?
[37:00.320 --> 37:05.120]  Yeah, I mean, for sure they're not bullish on the U.S. dollar and they're not bullish on Mr. Obama
[37:05.120 --> 37:09.920]  and they were never bullish on Mr. Bush. So in layman's terms, doctor, you've got all these
[37:09.920 --> 37:15.680]  countries sitting on trillions of dollars of dirty crud paper, not worth the, you know, papers.
[37:15.680 --> 37:24.800]  It's written on and so the entire magnetic or gravitational pull is only towards metals.
[37:24.800 --> 37:25.520]  Is that what you're saying?
[37:27.360 --> 37:36.880]  Well, I think that investors gradually realize that say, if you're an investor for the next
[37:36.880 --> 37:45.200]  10 years, what you don't want to own is, say, a 30-year U.S. government bond, you don't want
[37:45.200 --> 37:55.920]  to own a 10-year U.S. government bond at the yield of 3.6%. So what else is there? You can buy
[37:55.920 --> 38:03.200]  stock, you can buy precious metals, you can buy commodities. But commodities, the industrial ones
[38:03.200 --> 38:13.200]  and the agricultural ones and the stocks are very volatile and usually the supply response is
[38:13.200 --> 38:20.400]  relatively short. In other words, there's a shortage of wheat and soybeans, corn. Within one year,
[38:21.120 --> 38:26.320]  you can plant more. But in the case of precious metals, you can't do that.
[38:26.320 --> 38:36.000]  It's the same for oil. The supply response is very slow. And so the Chinese, if they could,
[38:36.720 --> 38:43.920]  they would buy all the American oil companies. Everone, ExxonMobil, Amazon Oil, whatever it is,
[38:43.920 --> 38:51.360]  and DHC and Rio Tinto. But politically, these countries, I mean, the U.S., Australia,
[38:51.360 --> 38:57.760]  Canada will not allow the Chinese to do that. So what else do they want to do? They go and buy
[38:57.760 --> 39:05.840]  confessions in Venezuela, in Latin America in general, and in Africa, and so forth and so on,
[39:06.400 --> 39:12.960]  and develop their own resource. Mr. Fawber, is it accurate to say that we're buying junk here in
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.800]  the U.S. with our money, they're buying real hard assets? Is it accurate that they own,
[39:16.800 --> 39:23.040]  that they're now producing over 90% of rare earth minerals? The Chinese? That is correct.
[39:24.400 --> 39:33.360]  Okay. The U.S. could produce much more. But the problem in the U.S. is that exploration, like
[39:34.720 --> 39:44.160]  generally speaking, capital spending, capital spending, which means education, R&D, infrastructure,
[39:44.160 --> 39:51.520]  plans, and equipment was neglected because the government, economic policy,
[39:52.160 --> 39:56.720]  and the federal economic policy, the federal board, economic policy,
[39:56.720 --> 40:01.520]  target consumption and not investment. Yes, sir. We're almost out of time. In the last three
[40:01.520 --> 40:07.760]  minutes we have with you, are we in a global depression? Are we entering one? Or are we going
[40:07.760 --> 40:15.680]  to enter one? And just overall summing up the state of the world economy and... You mentioned
[40:15.680 --> 40:25.600]  earlier on the world, the word end game. We are in the end game, but we are currently in a cracker
[40:25.600 --> 40:33.120]  boom. A cracker boom is when you postpone a recession through money printing and credit
[40:33.120 --> 40:39.120]  growth. The credit growth is not strong in the private sector, but it's much worse
[40:39.120 --> 40:46.560]  in the government sector. And the government is the most unproductive factor in economic life.
[40:47.600 --> 40:56.720]  And so this cracker boom will end very badly. But before it ends badly, we'll have money printing,
[40:56.720 --> 41:05.280]  very high inflation, and when everything fails, the U.S. will go to war. They are already in
[41:05.280 --> 41:13.840]  war, but they'll increase it. Absolutely. And you're saying two to four years is the main vector zone?
[41:13.840 --> 41:26.800]  Well, in my view, by printing money, you can postpone the evil at the end of the end game
[41:28.720 --> 41:35.040]  for, say, seven to ten years. Really? In America, they did it between 1980 and 89.
[41:36.080 --> 41:42.320]  But now the hangover is so much bigger, and it looks like everything is starting to accelerate
[41:42.320 --> 41:46.880]  so much faster. And you say we have dumb presidents. Well, it's just they're just looting the country.
[41:47.760 --> 41:56.720]  For the special... They are deluding the country. They're lying. And the fact is that for the
[41:56.720 --> 42:04.160]  typical household, and I'm not speaking here of the Goldman Sachs partner and Wall Street,
[42:04.160 --> 42:11.040]  but for the typical household, the median household, the average American, the standards
[42:11.040 --> 42:18.800]  of living have come down. Yes. And they will continue to go down under the president's economic
[42:18.800 --> 42:25.120]  policy. And that's why they put a police state grid in preemptively. It's extremely premeditated.
[42:25.120 --> 42:30.000]  Well, Mr. Fomber, the website's gloomboomdoom.com. We haven't had you on in about a year. I know
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.840]  you're very busy. I want to thank you for joining us and my pleasure. Thank you so much, sir. And I
[42:35.840 --> 42:42.160]  look forward to speaking to you in the near future again gloomboomdoom. Thank you so much. We'll talk
[42:42.160 --> 42:48.960]  to you again soon, sir. Amazing information. Oh, boy, I tell you, and that guy is super high
[42:48.960 --> 42:54.800]  power and his predictions are spot on. And we're not being negative here. It's best to know the
[42:54.800 --> 43:02.080]  truth and make preparations for it, isn't it? This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[43:02.080 --> 43:07.120]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[43:07.120 --> 43:12.080]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much
[43:12.080 --> 43:17.360]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[43:17.360 --> 43:22.320]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[43:22.320 --> 43:27.840]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[43:27.840 --> 43:32.640]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year,
[43:32.640 --> 43:36.960]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar
[43:36.960 --> 43:41.600]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.000]  the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can
[43:46.000 --> 43:52.720]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government
[43:52.720 --> 43:59.280]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[43:59.920 --> 44:04.720]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June of
[44:04.720 --> 44:10.640]  2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps the recession ended
[44:10.640 --> 44:15.200]  for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[44:15.200 --> 44:19.840]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their long expected journey to the
[44:19.840 --> 44:24.480]  moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[44:24.480 --> 44:30.080]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect. They both make fabulous investments. Food is our greatest
[44:30.080 --> 44:35.200]  dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource. You and your family
[44:35.200 --> 44:40.640]  need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals. Alex has been urging
[44:40.640 --> 44:45.440]  you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term. This will
[44:45.440 --> 44:50.720]  freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it. Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet

[45:20.800 --> 45:25.760]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner,
[45:25.760 --> 45:30.960]  General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently,
[45:30.960 --> 45:35.280]  he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important
[45:35.280 --> 45:40.080]  prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least
[45:40.080 --> 45:44.240]  watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple
[45:44.240 --> 45:50.880]  steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's
[45:50.880 --> 45:57.680]  End of America. The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of
[45:57.680 --> 46:04.240]  America 3.com. Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs

[46:58.800 --> 47:07.840]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:14.560 --> 47:21.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[47:21.840 --> 47:30.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[47:32.160 --> 47:38.080]  You have found the front lines of the Info War on Alex Jones here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[47:38.080 --> 47:43.680]  to 2 p.m. We have the bombshell, the huge, biggest revelations ever from Lindsey Williams on the
[47:43.680 --> 47:52.480]  geopolitical strategy from his inside source joining us tomorrow in T-minus 23 hours, 50 minutes.
[47:52.480 --> 47:56.560]  From now, he will be joining us. He was on the first hour that anybody wants to get the podcast
[47:56.560 --> 48:00.800]  later today with a prelude. He pretty much told you a lot of it then. He's pretty shook enough.
[48:00.800 --> 48:05.600]  This stuff's real, folks. And his latest, not predictions, inside info is all coming through.
[48:06.320 --> 48:10.560]  So that's coming up. Look, I want to go to Nathan, Tim, Joe, Ron, Scott, and others,
[48:10.560 --> 48:21.200]  the toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. And I do have a lot of news I want
[48:21.200 --> 48:26.240]  to get to. I'm going to recap that towards the end of the show, though, because I've been ranting
[48:26.240 --> 48:32.560]  and interviewing guests. I want to hear from you, but I'm always trying to take calls and then have
[48:32.560 --> 48:36.640]  them done quickly and for me not to babble for an hour when you ask a question. It's not really
[48:36.640 --> 48:40.160]  babbled, but you know what I mean. So I'm going to try to keep these down a minute and a half.
[48:40.160 --> 48:46.480]  I'm sure we'll fail, but we're trying. Venezuela denies Libyan leader Gaddafi en route. Yeah,
[48:46.480 --> 48:50.800]  because they probably don't want F-16s to blow it out of the sky in an accidental air crash or
[48:50.800 --> 48:55.280]  maybe hit him with an energy beam and he'll have a stroke on board. Oh, they've got those in the C-130s
[48:55.280 --> 49:04.320]  in the DC-10s. Venezuela denies Libya's Gaddafi en route, but the British Foreign Secretary William
[49:04.320 --> 49:11.360]  Haig said earlier today that their word from inside Libya as he has taken off for Venezuela,
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.280]  but who knows? One in Telegraph a few hours ago reported Libyan Colonel Gaddafi flees to Venezuela
[49:17.280 --> 49:23.360]  as cities fall to protesters. Their parliament has been burning all day, TV stations getting
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.720]  torched, riots in Iraq in the north and the central areas, gold surging, their commodities
[49:28.720 --> 49:33.760]  exploding, oil exploding. Meanwhile, the federal government's moving openly for internet kill
[49:33.760 --> 49:38.560]  switches, setting up police state grids here as well. This has all been orchestrated. Again,
[49:38.560 --> 49:44.480]  the protesters are real and many of the people have reasons to be angry. The point is, why are
[49:44.480 --> 49:50.640]  they being triggered now? Okay, it doesn't mean that we are for Gaddafi or that we're for Hazy
[49:50.640 --> 49:56.640]  Mubarak. We don't like them. The point is, the globalists want chaos. And this is what Williams
[49:56.640 --> 50:01.040]  told you four months ago in October. Now it's happening. This is what all the evidence shows.
[50:01.040 --> 50:06.880]  George Soros is all over this and he's a bad guy, folks. So think ahead a couple more moves
[50:06.880 --> 50:12.800]  and then think ahead a few more or just read the books written by Kissinger and the Council on
[50:12.800 --> 50:18.880]  Farm Relations reports and where they brag about all of it. And sure, they may lose control of these,
[50:18.880 --> 50:22.160]  but they still get the chaos they want, but they're shaking up the bag
[50:23.280 --> 50:27.920]  to move us into this next crisis phase. Okay, let's go to Nathan in Oklahoma. Nathan, you're on
[50:27.920 --> 50:33.520]  the air. All right. Hey, Alex, can you hear me all right? Worldwide transmission over. All right.
[50:34.240 --> 50:42.320]  Almighty, Almighty, this is PBR Street Gang over here on the air. Can you hear me? Yes, I can.
[50:43.040 --> 50:46.240]  All right. Well, thanks for taking my call. And one of the things I think that your
[50:46.240 --> 50:50.080]  college can't say enough, you know, is that thank you for doing what you do. You know,
[50:50.080 --> 50:53.840]  I thought I was born into one of the most boring periods of human history, but come to find out
[50:53.840 --> 50:58.240]  it's one of the most pristine moments. Now, the whole system, all they want is obsessed with Justin
[50:58.240 --> 51:05.120]  Bieber, whatever his name is, and Lady Boo Boo, and all this other idiocy. That's also people are,
[51:05.120 --> 51:10.240]  I hear adults talking about Justin Bieber and see kids with the cropping as moronic haircut.
[51:10.240 --> 51:14.320]  I mean, that doesn't matter. This is one of the most important times ever.
[51:15.280 --> 51:19.280]  They got giant cyclotrons. They're firing up. The Pentagon admits they're developing
[51:19.280 --> 51:24.320]  antimatter weapons. They're doing cross species genetic planting and release of insects. They're
[51:24.320 --> 51:30.560]  releasing mosquitoes that forcibly vaccinate you. They're rolling out brain altering vaccines,
[51:30.560 --> 51:37.680]  total insanity, 2011, government surveillance, blimps, artificial surveillance, dragonflies,
[51:37.680 --> 51:42.160]  and hummingbirds, and, and, and, and training the military to most citizens down and giant
[51:42.160 --> 51:47.920]  federalization, the threat fusion center command bases unrolling and FEMA camps openly being funded
[51:47.920 --> 51:53.040]  and total craziness from end to end. And the moron public who isn't awake, some are waking up and
[51:53.040 --> 51:56.960]  getting more awake, but the others are getting deeper in denial, running around talking about
[51:56.960 --> 52:02.480]  Justin Bieber. I'm sorry. Go ahead. You're good. And you're right. You know, we, we're in, you know,
[52:02.480 --> 52:06.640]  the largest awakening of the human, you know, the planet Earth has ever seen so far, which is,
[52:06.640 --> 52:12.480]  you know, a good, good thing. But I'll get to what I got to say. You covered that the globalists want
[52:12.480 --> 52:19.280]  to put chips in our brains, you know, on your last broadcast. Well, I have some the most powerful
[52:20.160 --> 52:24.480]  information that I think would be good and the surprising awakening of ours that
[52:24.480 --> 52:29.280]  we've yet to put to use. Tell us, tell us the info. All right. Well, it's our brain. And the
[52:29.280 --> 52:38.320]  call the first I have two studies to tell you about the first one is that there was a book
[52:38.320 --> 52:42.800]  called train your brain, train your mind, change your brain by Sharon Begley. Now in 2001,
[52:42.800 --> 52:47.040]  Richard Davidson, who is a scientist that studies neuroplastic, he did a test at his lab
[52:47.040 --> 52:51.120]  at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where he had the dollywam and another monk to come and be
[52:51.120 --> 52:57.040]  hooked up to an electron to phthalogram, also known as the EEG machine, which are measures and
[52:57.040 --> 53:01.120]  records the electrical activity of your brain. Now, first he had the moment I think of anything,
[53:01.120 --> 53:04.640]  and then he had to think of compassion. When he did this, the scales are not the charts that
[53:04.640 --> 53:09.680]  the amount of brain brain activity that was going on. I mean, that's that's not the only study.
[53:09.680 --> 53:14.560]  When the brain is in a loving, empathizing position, it's the highest level brainwaves
[53:14.560 --> 53:19.280]  you can have. And and that's absolutely right. Send that stuff over. I got to jump because
[53:19.280 --> 53:23.360]  I promise to get to a lot of collars, Nathan. Tim and Michigan, Tim, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[53:24.800 --> 53:29.760]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me? Strike leader, you are live. We are V2. Go ahead.
[53:29.760 --> 53:36.800]  Okay, Alex. Hey, how are you doing today? Anyway, listen, you know, I heard that gentleman say
[53:36.800 --> 53:46.160]  something about the U.S. printing money that I just wanted to get your quick answer to this.
[53:46.800 --> 53:58.480]  I am under the notion that as long as the U.S. remains this, you know, the standard,
[53:58.480 --> 54:08.640]  the standard of the world, they can continue to print money. But once that they lose that position
[54:09.360 --> 54:16.880]  as the World Reserve currency, right, that they will no longer be able just to print money.
[54:16.880 --> 54:22.720]  So what the G20 has been doing in the last five years is concerted the valuation of all major
[54:22.720 --> 54:28.400]  currencies to try to hide the inflation. But that's not happening now. So it's forcing a rush
[54:28.400 --> 54:33.840]  into commodities, which then exacerbates things going up even higher on top of dollar devaluation
[54:33.840 --> 54:40.400]  to purchase vital resources, food, energy. And that also drives investors and governments
[54:40.400 --> 54:45.440]  into gold and silver. So that's why they just try to use a propaganda overlay
[54:45.440 --> 54:50.240]  while the elites hoard gold and silver to tell the public, Justin Bieber doesn't like gold.
[54:50.240 --> 54:55.040]  They go, well, Justin Bieber doesn't like it. It's a horrible investment. It's only gone up
[54:55.040 --> 55:00.480]  400% in the last 10 years. Justin Bieber says don't get it. And they go, Justin Bieber says
[55:00.480 --> 55:05.600]  don't get it. And so they feel very genius and they waddle around and watch their football games
[55:05.600 --> 55:11.520]  and suck their thumbs with pleasure. But I mean, what's your question? Okay, well, actually, you
[55:11.520 --> 55:25.520]  know, I got the I got the chance to get to give my first public speech at a time at a street
[55:25.520 --> 55:32.080]  town hall meeting. Why are you doing that? Just watch Justin Bieber, man. Come on. Lady Gaga. Come
[55:32.080 --> 55:50.880]  on, man. Oh, look, we're getting fluoride taken out all over the world. We're kicking their
[55:50.880 --> 55:57.120]  hind end. I appreciate your call, Tim. Exactly. Look, look, when you realize how fake it all
[55:57.120 --> 56:03.920]  is, the football, the basketball, the Lady Gaga, the Justin Bieber, you know, who gives you these
[56:03.920 --> 56:09.040]  carbon tax messages, they tell your kids they got to love Justin Bieber. And then Bieber says,
[56:09.040 --> 56:16.000]  hand in your guns, pass the Cyber Security Act and, you know, the police state's good. And then
[56:16.000 --> 56:22.000]  your children are turned into mindless vassals who now they look up to some twit instead of looking
[56:22.000 --> 56:29.520]  up to Thomas Jefferson or looking up to Nikola Tesla or looking up to Magellan. I mean, kids,
[56:29.520 --> 56:38.080]  Magellan's a lot cooler than Justin Bieber. He circumnavigated with one ship the entire planet.
[56:38.080 --> 56:43.200]  He was killed by wild natives before they got back to Portugal. And when they got back, there was
[56:43.200 --> 56:49.600]  only like 11 people alive of the 200 and something crew. And the entire ship was rotting down to the
[56:49.600 --> 56:57.360]  waterline. That's destiny. That's will. That's striving. That's being a trailblazer and explore,
[56:57.360 --> 57:02.880]  going into space, mathematics, quantum mechanics, the secrets of the universe. It's all there.
[57:02.880 --> 57:08.960]  Life is fiery with its beauty. It's incredible detail, tuning into it. They want to shudder your
[57:08.960 --> 57:15.440]  mind, talking about Justin Bieber. It's pure evil. They're taking your intellect, your soul, and giving
[57:15.440 --> 57:22.960]  you Michael Jordan and Bieber. Unlock your human potential. Defeat the globalists who want to
[57:22.960 --> 57:30.400]  shudder your mind, their doorways to perception. I want to see you truly live. I want to see you
[57:30.400 --> 57:40.880]  truly be who you are. I don't want my progeny who's coming, my unborn grandchildren and great grandchildren
[57:40.880 --> 57:45.280]  to live in this nightmare system these control freaks have created.
[57:51.280 --> 57:56.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance
[57:56.880 --> 58:02.080]  to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[58:02.080 --> 58:07.280]  underneath the Americans at home. We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[58:07.280 --> 58:14.000]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.600]  to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore
[58:19.600 --> 58:25.120]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[58:25.120 --> 58:30.240]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying
[58:30.240 --> 58:34.880]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington,
[58:34.880 --> 58:43.680]  D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com

[58:50.880 --> 58:55.360]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one,
[58:55.360 --> 58:59.600]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[58:59.600 --> 59:04.480]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[59:04.480 --> 59:10.080]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[59:10.080 --> 59:15.120]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[59:15.120 --> 59:20.560]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always
[59:20.560 --> 59:25.040]  a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[59:25.040 --> 59:30.160]  onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[59:30.160 --> 59:34.240]  mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[59:34.240 --> 59:40.160]  one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.360]  Last week, the head of the country's central bank
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:20.000]  floated the idea of dumping the green pack as the world's reserve currency,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.440]  replacing it with an international currency. Thousands of people gathered to hear Barack
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:31.520]  Obama deliver key foreign policy speech on his current European tour. His vision for America's
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:39.600]  place in a new world order. Returning vets could be a risk to our nation. We've got to give them
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.040]  a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see. And one of
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.640]  the ways it will drive the change is through global governance. I think the new world order
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:57.280]  is emerging. This is a hoax and a scam which is designed to transfer wealth and power from the
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.760]  private sector to the government sector and from the government of the United States to a world
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.960]  government. And those people who have been yelling, oh, the UN's going to take over global
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.080]  government, conspiracy theories. They've been crazy, but now they're right. And who got the money?
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.640]  Hundreds and hundreds of banks, any bank that has access to the U.S. Federal Reserve's discount.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.280]  Can you tell us who they are? No. You know, financial terrorism. They have the ability to tweak
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:30.000]  the knob. I am proposing that the Federal Reserve be granted new authority. The ultimate goal of
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:37.280]  the carbon tax and the cap and trade is to destroy production. This energy tax is the largest tax
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.320]  increase in American history. We're actually creating a global warming police. So number one,
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.000]  they can come in. The federal government can come in and inspect your house and send you the bill.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.480]  We're setting up a global warming Gestapo. One of the things that if you talk to our
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:02:02.720]  journalists, they are desperate for is a civilian counterpart to our military forces. I am fixed.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:11.680]  And this is what I wear. Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:20.160]  enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad. I've now been in 57 states.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.080]  I think one left to go. The president, when he was in Europe last week, he met with the
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.680]  king of Saudi Arabia. He appeared to Bob. President Obama today proposed something new,
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:36.000]  something called prolonged detention. Pre-crime is where people are arrested and incarcerated to
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  prevent crimes that they have not yet committed.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.440]  It's the World Wrestling Federation. It's the Washington Wrestling Federation. They put on
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:07.680]  this show that they're bitter rivalries, you know, villains, and they really don't like each other.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.280]  But behind closed doors, they buddy up for a drink and make deals.
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:20.000]  Both the Republican and Democratic parties are owned by the same global elites. And on issues
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.720]  that matter to those global elites, they act as one. They've wrapped themselves in the American flag
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.560]  and they've talked about preserving American heritage and principles. And all the while,
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.760]  they're working to merge us into a new world order where our sovereignty will be destroyed,
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:43.840]  we'll lose all connection with our American heritage.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:50.720]  With Bush, you knew exactly what you were getting. It was, there was no iron fist in a
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.520]  velvet glove. It was just the iron fist. Whereas with Obama, you've got the velvet glove and the
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.920]  iron fist. You know, a very sharp guy, very smooth, knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.920]  For that reason, far more dangerous than Bush.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:10.320]  Well, at the end of last year, I was willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt. I thought it
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.760]  was premature to write this guy off. But now that he's been in office for a while, it's obvious
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:22.720]  that he is very tight with the Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan's on Wall Street. And he is extremely
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:30.880]  compliant and pliant to the wishes of the large banks, going back to what we saw with Robert
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.080]  Rubin under the Clinton administration, changing laws in favor of the banks. And he's not doing
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.800]  anything to stop the banks. He's helping the banks continue to do what they were doing under Bush.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.680]  So in fact, he's just a continuation of Bush on the subject of markets and finance, which is the
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:51.600]  most important part of his policy right now. People who voted for Obama wanted real change and
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.880]  they're getting platitudes, they're getting a lot of nice talk.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.640]  of GM. Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, general growth properties.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:32.240]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.800]  online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet. And it's a real eye
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.520]  opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.600]  explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:28.080]  We're live, locked and loaded, ready to go. Thank you so much for joining us. It is Wednesday,
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:36.000]  the 23rd day of February 2011. Incredible interview with Lindsey Williams yesterday. We're doing part
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.880]  two of that live with even more revelations of how the globalists have orchestrated the collapse
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:48.160]  in the Middle East to then break their deal with the Arabs to not develop the massive oil reserves
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.440]  in North America. They had a deal set up in the 70s where they would not allow massive development
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:01.920]  of oil on public lands in Alaska, in Colorado, in Utah, and in many other areas. Texas is a
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.320]  state that rebelled and didn't go along with it. That's why it's one of the few states that continued
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:11.200]  to develop its reserves that are nothing compared to Alaska. And that's the double cross
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.440]  of the Arabs. But then that leads to the death of the dollar by the end of 2012
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:19.760]  from his inside sources known to us, by the way, one of them Ken Fromm died in December,
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:25.920]  the other even more high powered. We just call him Mr. L, former CEO of a major oil company.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:30.480]  He'll be joining us to discuss that more and take your phone calls in the third hour.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.880]  Porter Stansbury on the death of the dollar. He was on with us a few months ago. He predicted
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.280]  so much of now what is beginning to accelerate and unfold. There's reasons that we're seeing riots
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:45.040]  all over the world now and demonstrations in the West is because the standard of living is
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.760]  plunging right now. And the media is saying, oh, it's a boom time. The economy's great.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.760]  The session ended almost two years ago. Everything's wonderful. Everything's wonderful.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:02.560]  But you're seeing what they've tried to paper over basically coming out from behind the edges.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.280]  So it's going to get more and more crazy. We're going to be breaking that down. Also,
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:18.720]  I had a caller on Monday who said, Alex, I read in a report.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:25.360]  I really need to take this call. Stuff is getting so crazy and so busy. I'm just not
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:29.600]  going to take it even though it's super important. Hey, can I call you back during the break?
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:38.400]  Okay, I'll call you back in 10. Thanks. Can't ignore that phone call. It deals with the show.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:46.000]  Sorry. Doing some producer work myself. So I have to deal with that. We had a caller
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.960]  who was saying that he had read somewhere but didn't see any
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:02.320]  bibliographed linkage that the U.S. government is training with foreign governments to occupy
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:09.360]  the U.S. with foreign troops. And I just off the top of my head said, well, if you watch my film,
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:15.920]  Road to Terony, we have the Associated Press and Toronto Star and other news articles on the screen
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:23.120]  where in 2002 they signed agreements to use Mexican and Canadian troops in the United States for,
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:30.080]  quote, civil unrest and terrorism to fight foreign domestic terrorist and for civil uprisings.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:37.040]  That's in the NLE09 drill. Just put in NLE09, the first link you get. In fact, let's just put it
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.240]  on screen for folks watching on PrismPlanet.tv. Use FEMA, putting a press release out how they
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.640]  were working with all these foreign governments to track and suppress terrorists during an uprising
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:56.000]  in the U.S. Then, of course, there's the quotes by different generals that we've played on the air,
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.440]  what Wesley Clark's one of them. Also, Colonel Craig Roberts' nephew going out of West Point
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:09.200]  was given an internal briefing with several hundred of the cadets. And then after,
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.840]  Roberts has told the story many times, then later he was given another briefing once he was out of
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:22.880]  the training and in the official military that, yes, foreign assets would be used during uprisings
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.080]  in the United States. Just corrupt systems always try to use outside forces because
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.560]  even if you can get 30, 40, 50 percent of your troops to fire on their own citizens
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.960]  or even if you fly New Yorkers down to Texas or Texans up to Wisconsin,
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:44.960]  you know, a lot of times countries will try to, we saw this during the uprising in Tiananmen Square.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.200]  It took them about a day and a half to respond because they shipped in trips from several,
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.840]  what was it, 400, 500 miles away from a totally different province where they even spoke a different
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:11:01.120]  Chinese dialect to make sure they weren't shooting mommy and daddy and brother and sis and their
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:09.040]  cousin. And so I really should do some more research on this or re-go over research to
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.880]  re-codify it and do a special report on it. And I said last week I'd do a special report this week
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:20.640]  on the fact that we've been completely vindicated by governmental and private reports dealing with
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.680]  the anthrax attacks being an inside job. That was just in the Washington Post last week. I mean,
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:31.600]  there's so much evidence I can't even get over all the information that we have here. I mean,
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.600]  I can't even go over all of it myself. It's just pouring in. But looking at news this morning
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:48.640]  that the crew printed off for me, I noticed a Canada.com news report. And in fact, this didn't
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:54.160]  print the whole story. You guys print me the rest. Thank you. And this is out of the Ottawa
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:00.240]  Citizen, one of the biggest national papers. It's the paper there in the capital city of Ottawa
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:08.240]  in Canada. And here's the headline. Canada, U.S. agree to use each other's troops in several
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:20.400]  emergencies. And I mentioned Monday that during the Olympics last year, U.S. troops were in the
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.120]  major cities where the Olympics were taking place in Canada. And that was all over the news. And
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:30.400]  U.S. troops and Canadian troops were patrolling the bar districts. So they used special events to
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.040]  acclimate you to this, like having troops at the Kentucky Derby or troops at the Super Bowl. And
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:40.320]  then they just start rolling them out everywhere. But there's the Ottawa Citizen. Canada, U.S. agree
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:46.080]  to use each other's troops in civil emergencies. Canada and the U.S. have signed an agreement,
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.800]  by the way, they signed it eight years ago. This is an expansion that paves the way for the
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.120]  militaries from each other's nations to send troops across each other's borders during an
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.440]  emergency. But some are questioning why the Harper government has kept silent on the deal.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:05.680]  Well, eight years ago when it was announced in the AP and the Washington Post, you know,
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.120]  Toronto Star as well was in the Mexican newspapers because they're not just going to use
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.680]  Mexican and Canadian troops here, they're going to use them in Canada and Mexico. It's all vice
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.800]  versa, each other's armies inside each other's countries. And under the agreement, it was a
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:27.040]  North American Union agreement for North American security perimeter 2002. Then it was signed under
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:33.040]  executive treaty, which is unconstitutional. Congress didn't ratify it by George W. Bush,
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:42.000]  Vincente Fox, and who was the prime minister of Canada at the time?
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.920]  It'll pop in my head in a minute. The point is they signed it at Baylor about 90 miles north
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:53.200]  of me up here in Waco. And then the treaty was secret. I mean, it was on record, secret treaty,
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.600]  and there was almost no news coverage of it. But then judicial watch and others sued and were able
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:05.680]  to get not the treaty, but the SPP meeting from 2006 at Banff, Canada, where they were reading
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.960]  over sections of the treaty. So we got most of it from the minutes. And at that Banff, Canada
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:17.280]  meeting, you had over 500 CEOs from Europe and North America and Asia, and they ratified the plan
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:23.840]  for the SPP, the ongoing plan, and then ordered the heads of the different state departments of
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:29.440]  the countries to execute it. And I mean, in the thousands of pages, judicial watch got and posted
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.680]  on their site, and we boil it down and cover it in the endgame. And there's a bibliography of it,
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.000]  and what is the endgame.com? Everything in the film has a bibliography online. We check every
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:44.320]  minute of the film. It has links and documents. And that's why I'm always freaking out. This is
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.960]  so big. This is so out in the open now. And it said we're going to call it a North American
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:55.440]  security perimeter, but we've got to integrate our nations by stealth because this is very unpopular
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:04.320]  politically. And in there, they said they would use the threat of terrorism, natural disaster,
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:14.800]  the flu, other biological problems. They said that they would use that as a
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:22.640]  way to sell the public in the future on accepting having each other's militaries in each other's
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:29.680]  countries. And World Net Daily covered it. Judicial Watch covered it. We covered it.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:34.560]  Coast to coast AM covered. A few others did, but really nobody else. But the point I'm making to
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.040]  the caller for Monday is he said on the spot, give me documentation. I gave him from memory
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:44.080]  a lot of places where he could get it. But I mean, here's February 22nd yesterday. I got it this
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:49.440]  morning without even looking. I mean, I see this stuff every month or so, sometimes more often,
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.520]  where they admit that it is to suppress insurrection. I mean, go read it. It's the
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:03.440]  National Paper of Canada. Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:09.760]  is over. It ended on June of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.080]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us,
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.800]  things seemed to be getting worse. Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.680]  long expected journey to the moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.720]  silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct. They both make fabulous
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:34.160]  investments. Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:39.600]  resource. You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or

[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.080]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.400]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.520]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:19.040]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:24.160]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:29.440]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:34.080]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:39.440]  weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.840]  peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:49.760]  one of my old sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:16.000]  Broadcasting Network. Network. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.960]  in the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Absolutely,
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:27.200]  Matt Powell joining us in about five minutes, and I'm going to start getting into the Rumsfeld
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:31.280]  clips ahead of him joining us, but finishing up that story, why it's so important. Here's the
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:37.360]  nice lady been, you know, cutting my hair on and off for about a year, and she just brings up out of
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.960]  the blue TSA with her boyfriend flying back from, I think it was North Carolina, she said,
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.200]  and he went through the scanner, and he was waiting to then be padded down. They were padding
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:52.480]  down everybody who went to the scanner, she said. He told her, and he put his hands in his pockets,
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:56.960]  just standing around. A lot of people do that, and they were like, get your hands out of your
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.640]  pockets right now. Get them out, get them out, get over, you got to go back through the scanner,
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.240]  you're hiding something, and they put him back through the scanner and then padded him down,
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:09.760]  and were just being really mean to him. Like, he was a prisoner on a bus who'd just been taken
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:17.120]  out of the county jail being sent to San Quentin or Huntsville, and you're rolling up, and that's
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:22.240]  exactly how they treat you at a rough prison. I mean, from what I've read, even low security
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.560]  prisons, they're not that rude or mean to you, not even so much medium, but high security,
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.680]  you know, they let you know, they humiliate you, they strip you down, and in some cases,
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:36.560]  TSA strips you down in public or takes you in a back room while they rob your suitcase of money.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:42.800]  I mean, just every day, multiple articles of them being caught stealing wedding rings, cash, jewelry,
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:49.840]  electronics, I mean, it is just a orgy of theft that's going on, and this is the public being
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:54.160]  trained how to be prisoners, but they're not going to put up with it forever, they're not going to
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:22:00.320]  break the will of the American people. Now, we're only going to briefly have man cow on, then I'm
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:06.480]  going to get into patent, nervous system manipulation from television monitors, and how that ties in to
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:12.160]  this other report that we covered a few months ago, ceiling lights in Minnesota send code,
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.520]  internet data, but then we've got the patents on similar systems that flash at a level not
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:22.000]  perceptible by the eye, but to the brain, and could actually manipulate you with that. I mean,
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.360]  this is confirmed, you know, the whole thing of how a hypnotist with a flashing light or the
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.680]  swinging watch, this is much more high tech than that, and they can actually make you throw up,
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:36.240]  they can do anything they want with this, and now through data, through power lines, they can do it
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:42.080]  with the fluorescent bulbs, that's why they've unified these worldwide, notice worldwide,
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:48.560]  these are going in, governments pass the laws to get in line with the UN Gen 21, and they're toxic,
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:52.560]  if one breaks in your house, you've got to evacuate it and open the windows and call a
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.920]  toxin control team, poison control team, they're getting rid of phosphorescent, because these
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.080]  are systems literally for mind control, and it's hidden in plain view that's coming up.
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:09.200]  But first, here's the big news, Donald Rumsfeld, imagine this, Donald Rumsfeld, former secretary
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:15.200]  of defense, out pushing his book, went on ManCal Muller's syndicated broadcast that's on all over
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:19.680]  the country, including W.A.B.C. in New York, and he says, hey, what about building seven?
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.320]  What about building seven? We're going to play that short clip first, and Rumsfeld says,
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:29.520]  never heard of it, don't know anything about it. Now, this was a CIA state federal command base
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:34.480]  with the Army Defense Intelligence Senate, FBI, the command center for that entire area of the
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:38.560]  East Coast, they're running a drill of it being attacked that day, that's why they moved the
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.800]  command centers out on the pier and the mobile command centers, that's ABC News reporting that,
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:46.640]  and Rumsfeld says he never heard of it, he says building what? That's why it's called the Building
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:51.200]  What campaign, the ads running in New York that have gotten Geraldo Rivera to wake up and come out
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.440]  and say he questions building seven, and Judge Andrew Napolitano, because they have honor,
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:01.280]  especially Napolitano, because last night I was picking up some Mexican food to bring home,
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:08.320]  I do that quite often, I have to add to my gut, and I was walking out and a fellow walked over
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:13.920]  to me and said, you know, I'm a mainline conservative that you woke me up, my dad didn't believe in
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.680]  9-11 being an inside job, but I showed him the footage of building seven and plotting, and
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:23.040]  you know, he was a Navy SEAL slash UDT, his dad, and he said, that's a controlled demolition,
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:27.360]  yeah, they blew it, I mean, that's all you got to do is watch Building Seven, so that's why,
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:33.360]  I mean, look at Jesse Ventura, UDT, Navy SEAL, saying the same thing, anybody who knows sees
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.840]  that, but then we have all the footage of the saying, get back, we're going to blow up seven,
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:41.040]  we have the local newscast saying they're thinking about bringing the building down,
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:45.280]  let's go ahead and play this 20-second clip, and there's a longer one coming up,
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:49.600]  with the former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, on Mancow's radio show,
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.720]  the audio is also at mancow.com, here it is. Building Seven, I often hear about,
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:59.040]  no plane hit Building Seven, why did Building Seven come down? What do you tell people?
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.440]  What is Building Seven? Or when it was at Building Five, or the building that wasn't hit by the plane?
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.600]  Building Seven. I have no idea, I've never heard that.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:17.600]  Do a talk radio show. Oh, you'll hear it. There's a longer clip coming up, Mancow,
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:22.480]  do you really believe that a 47-story building, it would be the biggest building in over 40 states,
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:29.120]  several hundred yards away, not hit by a falling building, fire started and it collapses at 525
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:33.760]  the afternoon, CNN, the police are on tape saying get back, they're going to blow up that building,
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:39.200]  I can play that clip if you want to hear it, and Rumsfeld magically doesn't know about the main CIA
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.800]  building on the east coast outside Lainley, blowing up and collapsing that day at free fall speed.
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.920]  Oh my god, Alex, I'm walking through TJ Maxx with my kids, what are you asking me?
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:59.040]  You sent me the Building Seven clip yesterday, it was on your show today, you brought it up to me,
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.400]  you said this is really starting to make you question things.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:09.680]  Well, okay, look here's the deal, I feel like the Jedi mind trick was telling me,
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.680]  like how could he not know, I couldn't wrap my mind around it, I just, you don't even know how to
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:20.480]  respond, it's kind of like you walk in with your wife and she's with another guy and you say,
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:25.360]  hey honey, what's going on, and she says, oh what guy, there's no guy here, but I can see the guy,
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:30.160]  I mean, it was just so far, I mean, look, he was very friendly, he saw the letterman,
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:35.040]  he was very friendly on letterman as well, he was a very friendly guy, but how does he know?
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:41.120]  Building Seven came down, it defies everything, doesn't it?
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:45.120]  Well, you can hear how he suddenly, because I've heard the rest of the interview,
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:50.160]  he's a lot more energetic, he just gets real quiet and goes, no, I don't know anything about that,
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:56.160]  I mean, that's got LIE written all over it. Well, how does he not know Building Seven?
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:02.320]  Excuse me, how does he not know Building Seven, what do you make of that?
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:08.240]  Well, man Cal, they never want to talk about Building Seven, they never paid any attention to
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:12.880]  it, I've got scores and I've played them here over and over again, we've written articles about it,
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:20.000]  with CNN, local CBS, local Fox, Amy Goodman was there and they're told to run, it's going to
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.840]  blow up and the cops are saying, get back, it's about to come down, they're going to bring down
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:28.240]  that building, Silverstein goes on PBS a year later and says, we gave the order to pull it
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:33.200]  and then watch the building come down. Well, look, I've heard the stories, it was a plain
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:38.080]  demolition, right, they were going to bring it down, now I've heard that and now they're claiming
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:44.480]  that another building fell on it, although that's not really what happened, is what you say and
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:51.440]  others say, so where are you heading with this, are you saying Grosfeld and Bush and both and
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:55.760]  all these characters were handled at the day, they brought down all these buildings?
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:02.000]  Well, you know, we have to ask the question, why are they acting stupid, why is it on record that
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.600]  they said they were going to blow it up, BBC 25 minutes before on BBC World and BBC 24,
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:15.280]  simultaneously with the same script with their teleprompter readers on two different BBCs said
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:20.000]  Building 7, the Solomon Brothers building has fallen, it's completely collapsed and there they
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:27.040]  are live with it right behind them, it hasn't collapsed and then they denied that they even
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:32.240]  did that, then years later BBC said yes, we were told by Reuters that it collapsed, this is what's
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:37.440]  happening, it's kind of like Lee Harvey Oswald, two hours before his name was released, about an hour
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:43.440]  before he was even captured running around Dallas, they got their time zones wrong and in New Zealand,
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:49.120]  Australia and several other countries, newspapers ran with his photo and his name that he was the
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:54.160]  shooter of John F. Kennedy when it wasn't even on the news here yet, they had their story and their
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:29:01.920]  script ready and they jumped the gun, they jumped the gun. Hello friends, this is Alex Jones,

[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:14.240]  off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home, I've turned
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:20.000]  tremendous influence on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots, I think
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.640]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention, for the republic identifies
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:32.800]  the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:37.760]  its ashes constructing world government, Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:42.560]  for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody

[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:09.920]  it ended on June of 2009, the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree, perhaps a
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.240]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seemed
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:18.800]  to be getting worse, gold and silver haven't heard the news either, they've begun their long

[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:08.800]  Coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:21.520]  what we've got here is failure to communicate some man you just can't reach so you get what
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:27.040]  we had here last week which is the way he walks well he is
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:33.280]  I don't like any more than you
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:40.160]  it's waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:47.200]  look at your young men fighting look at your women crying
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:54.400]  look at your young men dying the way they've always done before
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.400]  I
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:06.400]  did a different news networks and watching how things are done I mean just and this is not
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:11.520]  going to really help you in your show I just find it interesting that every time I'm with a crowd
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:22.000]  and I was at CPAC and you know Ron Paul won 30% I mean he won and then some other people were
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.160]  getting 2 and 3% and that's who we hear about on tv Ron Paul killed at CPAC and all we hear about
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:34.000]  is Romney uh I've broken bread with Romney I've hung out with Romney he's he's a nice as a fella
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  he's unelectable as president and if the republicans their main thing seems to be against healthcare
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:47.520]  or blah blah care uh and yet that's what Romney gave us uh in minnesota Romney wrote it uh Romney
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:54.880]  wrote it yeah so I look there's well there's a lot that is is uh very odd to me I I I mean
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.440]  I see right it's it's like the building seven I you know building seven came down no it didn't
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:06.960]  these aren't the droids you're looking for uh yeah you know um Ron uh Ron Paul in every one of
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:12.000]  these pools wins and you and I are both friends with Ron Paul so maybe that that distorts our view
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.520]  I and I and I like him politically but it's just amazing Romney is a guaranteed loser and that's
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:21.440]  who they're gonna run and they keep telling us Romney Romney Romney reminds me of Giuliani
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:26.720]  member Giuliani remember Fred Thompson yeah they're putting a a a a horse that can't win and it's like
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.840]  a uh Don King fight where he puts a fight around that couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:37.280]  against Tyson but expanding on that analogy and now you gotta go but I mean this is important
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:43.760]  man cow expanding on that he only won by two points last year he won by seven points totally
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:50.640]  creaming Romney uh in second place and I was listening to uh the radio news feed that this
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:58.560]  network Genesis carries uh and uh they didn't even uh report the Monday after that Ron Paul had won
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:04.480]  all they talked about was Mitt Romney and so I just exactly I mean it's like the Super Bowl
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:09.680]  and uh you know a team wins yeah and then they don't even tell you about the team that won the
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:15.040]  Super Bowl they tell you about the team that lost and imply that they won yeah hey uh I mean it is
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:22.160]  the generals versus the Globetrotters and yet they keep running the generals uh hey bud let me let
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:28.160]  me tell you here in Chicago what happened yesterday oh yeah all the selection fraud I mean let me
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:34.720]  stop you talk about it a magically record uh voting problems and and the gangster Rahm Emanuel he's
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:42.000]  in tell us now well look you have a uh it's so big Alex it's so big and I don't want to insult
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.440]  your listeners I I I but it's so big I don't even know how to put it in the radio terms and this is
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:52.800]  what I do for a living let me try to make it simple this guy Ron Blagojevic came out and said look
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:58.240]  there there are crooks they want to jack up your taxes they want to steal from you I won't let them
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:06.320]  they're going to dummy up something to try to destroy me and and uh you know I thought well
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:12.480]  that guarantees our taxes aren't going to go up uh they jacked up our taxes 67% they keep telling us
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:19.920]  this guy's a crook the courts freed him a jury said no this guy's in a crook at all and immediately
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:24.640]  I mean immediately they streamed down court retrial and of course the government has endless
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:30.000]  funds to go after people they've never proven anything against this guy look all I live in
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.840]  Illinois all these guys are crooks but but they haven't been able to prove anything on this kid
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:38.240]  so he says he's going to talk and if he talks the house of Obama comes down
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:45.120]  Barry's house of cards comes well listen he better talk now because Ron Brown the commerce secretary
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.600]  was going to go down he said I'm going to talk and they and they shot him in the head and
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.600]  blew the airplane up back of his head and had the special forces blow the hatch and he low
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:58.560]  high low out of the plane you have time for me to finish here yes go ahead so so you know the daily
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:04.080]  family mere daily a famous name in Chicago he's going to step down his brother replaces rama
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:11.200]  manual rama manual the head of the white house is coming to chicago uh I know for a fact the number
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:18.000]  one guy and he's a great man he's a great man okay and maybe someday I'll talk about it I gave him
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.800]  my word that I would not and I'm telling you the guy that would have been the next mayor of chicago
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:29.920]  that is a great man got a personal call from his old political buddy obama and obama said look you
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:37.200]  can't run do not run and this this guy decided not to and I don't know what kind of I don't know
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:42.080]  what was said what was promised if there was threats Alex I don't know my point is here comes
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.960]  rama manual to make sure all the bodies stay buried figuratively uh blagojevich are going to
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:52.720]  make sure he doesn't talk they want to make sure they protect I believe and I study this and I live
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:57.840]  this guys I believe they want to they want to protect the house of cars that is the obama
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:02.560]  administration they don't want the truth to come out and this election less than less than half a

[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:51.280]  and those watching as we simulcast at prison planet dot tv in video living color that obama's
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:58.240]  speech last night shang we in the past days and preparing an international response into libya
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:02.640]  you notice they use the cover of egypt to move in a couple more aircraft carriers and big task
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:11.680]  force groups oil prices have gone up more than what 27 dollars uh this week they're up to 119
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:19.760]  dollars right now we haven't seen oil prices at the gas pump this high since 2008 and they are
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:27.840]  preparing globalist backed units in ben gazi to try to invade uh triply the wall street journal
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:34.480]  uh is reporting that they believe he has nerve gas and high-tech missiles they're gonna try to use
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.800]  now i want to pull back from this and look at the larger geopolitical ramifications because
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:43.600]  every political analyst who we have had on this show we only have people on who've been right
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:47.840]  about 95 of the time people who really know what's happening in the world and folks that
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.680]  their information matches my research but then they can take us even further because of their
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:58.640]  specialities in those areas are concurring and when we're saying years ago months ago
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:04.080]  you've heard them here that there would be a destabilization campaign in the middle east
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:09.840]  that it was a new kamikaze mode instead of just invading afghanistan or iraq or you know
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.680]  encircling pakistan and inserting special ops and now caught a cia guy there reportedly the news
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:21.360]  is saying that he was trying to give uh an official material nuclear material to al qaeda that's
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:26.720]  groups they control again as a pretext to invade pakistan i mean this is getting wild we now it's
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:32.160]  a hundred percent clear what's happening doesn't mean who's in mubarak's good it doesn't mean that
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:36.800]  muammar qaddafi's good it doesn't mean that the people running saudi arabia good no they're bad
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:41.920]  and and but and it's a political climate an atmosphere where the globalist can knock the
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:47.840]  dominos over the question is why do they want that now i haven't talked or even read in the last
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:53.360]  few days i probably should have but we i get so busy what wane madson thinks about this i know he
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:59.360]  predicted a lot of this years ago and again months ago on the show formerly a anti-submarine warfare
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:04.880]  expert uh worked then in the nsa and a lot of other classified areas he's written for some of the
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:11.360]  biggest magazines and newspapers in the nation wane madson report dot com he reports on national
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:19.040]  security and international issues uh for major tv stations around the world and uh he also reports
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.280]  uh routinely from what's happening the national press club so i don't know what he's going to
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:29.520]  say about what's happening in triply uh or what's happening in egypt or or this domino effect uh or
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:34.720]  saudi arabia handing out 37 million dollars in a single day to people yesterday and the king
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:38.960]  having to come back to saudi arabia from his european pleasure palaces worried about overthrow
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:44.080]  but this i believe is the clear double cross of the more friendly arab regime so the more neutral
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:50.080]  ones to put things into an order out of chaos situation and i predicted they would then blame
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.720]  the depression on this and now i saw headlines the last two days that oh this is going to kill
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:58.880]  the recovery oh we're going to have a depression because of this oh the oil prices are going up
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:04.480]  because of this no the underlying situation is dollar devaluation so for the next 30 minutes
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:09.200]  we're joined by wane madson and wane madson report when you've heard me the last three minutes
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:16.720]  break down my analysis of this and the horror of the prospect of un nato us backed forces
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:23.600]  going into triply uh give us your take on what you think well i i i still believe that what we're
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:30.880]  seeing in north africa especially north africa is i was triggered by the same forces that uh
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:38.880]  triggered the anti-government uh anti-austerity moves in greece where we could have had riot
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:44.080]  there again uh over the austerity measures the budget cuts in the last few days that
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:51.520]  we saw it in spain we saw it in uk and i think this is what really was seen uh seizing under the
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:59.600]  uh under all the other um problems we had in north africa now we know from the state department
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:08.320]  campbell uh from wiki leaks that um obviously the ngos the soros back groups the national
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:14.880]  diamond for democracy the freedom house and these other uh ngos that are always in there
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:19.680]  trying to stir up the opposition we're involved in all these countries oh they admit they are
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:26.160]  they're they're they're bragging now wane yeah but i think where they miscalculated is they thought
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:31.520]  with the jasmine revolution in tunisia and the lotus revolution in egypt that these were going
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:38.160]  to be uh soft landing type uh changeovers like they saw in ukraine and a few of these other
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:45.120]  soft revolutions but they miscalculated because because of the unemployment and the high food
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:53.120]  prices and the disgust especially amongst the young people about these regimes this thing these
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:53:00.320]  exploded and and i believe that they're not uh under control anymore we we know uh there were
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:08.000]  signs that qaddafi last month was thinking about succession of his sons bahid al-islam qaddafi i've
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.120]  written about this this guy was this guy was a sweetheart as far as the elites of europe were
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:18.800]  concerned he's a good friend of lord peter mandelson the former british uh rs our business
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:23.920]  secretary he's very good friends with prince andrew and also very good friends with nithaniel
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:30.960]  rottschild the sign of the rottschild family uh this this is a crowd he traveled with he's a
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:37.440]  graduate of london school of economics but now we heard him defending his father on tv talk about
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:44.720]  you know uh he'll be you know shot if you are caught with weapons and all this i think this
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:51.680]  is out of control i was in qaddafi's tent uh in triple eight in october oh nine and uh it was the
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:56.800]  40th anniversary of the coup which he called this is green revolution and over through the king but
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:04.000]  i find it interesting last month qaddafi uh gave back oil property seized from the king's side this
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:12.160]  king etrus al-senusi now the senucians were from um god the sirenica that area is broke away so
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:19.760]  uh i believe that qaddafi probably understood that the republicans energy of that state is very
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:27.920]  short uh and he was looking at succession possibly a role for the former royal family who he had
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:34.560]  opposed in 69 now we don't know where they stand but i think it's very instructive that the flag
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:41.280]  being used by the opposition is the royal don't want to flag the okay wane wane we got you on short
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:44.640]  notice you're on your cell phone i'm going to wait a moment till it comes back and gets a little
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:49.840]  bit better but the big issue i want to bring up to you what do you make of obama's incredible
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:55.520]  speech i mean this is war under another name he says we're preparing an intervention we're preparing
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:01.120]  international forces to go in and now they're reporting the wall street journal and others
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:06.880]  that qaddafi's i believe it i know he's got it heavily armed is going to try to use nerve gas on
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:12.640]  him and i i mean this is a nightmare well the wall street journal i'm always so skeptical about
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:19.760]  them they're neocons from the word go we also have his uh justice minister who resigned saying that
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:26.400]  qaddafi was totally behind what locker b when we know to the contrary it was iran of course
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:33.440]  george w bush found it convenient to blame qaddafi because he didn't want iran getting involved with
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:40.960]  plans to go into iraq during the lead up to desert storms so so there's a lot of people in who have
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:46.560]  left qaddafi's regime who for one reason or another is sort of like those old soviet defectors they
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:52.320]  always would overstate the threat so that's like all the iraqi defectors that we now know are paid
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:57.520]  to live oh absolutely like her both so i i would take some of what these guys are saying what the
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:03.760]  grain is all about uh qaddafi having bio and chemical weapons after all he allowed inspectors
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:10.000]  in there uh under the bush administration the last administration uh to to to turn all that stuff
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  over uh so these people are obviously trying to score political points more with the western media
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.360]  but it was quite clear when i was in triply that qaddafi who gave a speech today where he's talking
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:26.160]  about he's he's no different than the queen of england or the king of thailand he's just the figure
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:33.040]  head uh he has no real power well when you first land in triply you see his his portrait is everywhere
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:39.920]  a huge uh portraits on the sides of buildings uh over over the uh overpasses on the highways going
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:48.480]  into triply and in hotels uh in lobbies uh uh in in offices everywhere you find qaddafi looking down
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:55.440]  at you and kind of like janet nipolitano on the high tech uh telescreens going in 9 000 locations
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:02.880]  another telltale sign of classical corruption in 1984 societies right and he's clear that this
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:09.280]  this was a dictatorship but called a personality like in north korea with kim jong il and uh and
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:14.880]  the other thing i noticed is people even close to qaddafi would talk about him it was clear that
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:20.640]  even the people in his regime did not like him uh as a matter of fact i i asked him when i was in his
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:26.240]  10 i said what's what's with that guy i know he doesn't drink but it is clear he's he is he on
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:31.440]  medication thinking maybe the guy's ill and he's they just smiled at you know he said hashish
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:37.120]  apparently so he said today he said oh these kids out there were involved in the rebellion are
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:43.280]  on hallucinogenic drugs when he's looking a mirror and he sees a picture of somebody's oh yeah i mean
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:51.200]  i mean you can look at him wane and tell that he's on some hardcore drugs
