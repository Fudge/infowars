[00:00.000 --> 00:11.280]  Well, it's four o'clock, four o'one now, Central Standard Time, five o'clock Eastern.
[00:11.280 --> 00:15.480]  And George Norrie, one of the hardest working guys in the media, and of course one of the
[00:15.480 --> 00:18.120]  most listened to and watched, is our guest.
[00:18.120 --> 00:24.600]  He's a multi-time Emmy Award winner for his news TV coverage.
[00:24.600 --> 00:29.160]  He's a longtime radio talk show host, he's a best-selling author, and he has the second
[00:29.160 --> 00:33.760]  largest radio show and audience, period, 16 plus million people.
[00:33.760 --> 00:38.320]  That's just on AM and FM, and there's XM, internet, it's just amazing.
[00:38.320 --> 00:42.960]  And he really, more than anybody out there, if you had to put it all together, helped
[00:42.960 --> 00:47.320]  bring my message of information to the general public in the last eight years, having me
[00:47.320 --> 00:51.380]  on as a guest at Coast to Coast AM, coast to coastam.com.
[00:51.380 --> 00:57.640]  And by the way, he invited me on this next Monday, it was funny, I mean, I invited him
[00:57.640 --> 01:00.920]  to pop on here, he kind of begged him because I know he's a busy guy and he needs to get
[01:00.920 --> 01:04.800]  some sleep, and then I kind of said, hey, I like to do the full interviews, I like popping
[01:04.800 --> 01:05.800]  in during the news.
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.680]  He said, all right, Alex, you're on next Monday, but then they told me what they wanted to
[01:10.680 --> 01:15.840]  talk about, it's always, you know, just simple areas, I can talk about whatever I want, but
[01:15.840 --> 01:16.840]  it's general topics.
[01:16.840 --> 01:19.760]  He said, I want to talk about Alex Jones and then the state of the world.
[01:19.760 --> 01:24.240]  So I guess we're talking some about little old me, but I guess it is kind of the transformation
[01:24.240 --> 01:25.240]  and awakening.
[01:25.240 --> 01:29.040]  I've got to tell you, George, so much of what you've been talking about for decades and
[01:29.040 --> 01:31.600]  I've been talking about for close to that.
[01:31.600 --> 01:37.040]  It's not that it's even becoming passé, but now it's like it's worse than we thought.
[01:37.040 --> 01:40.480]  Government wants Google to shut down videos that are critical, street lights that listen
[01:40.480 --> 01:41.480]  to you.
[01:41.480 --> 01:44.400]  Oh, there are cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[01:44.400 --> 01:51.880]  I mean, it's like if we're almost becoming passé at a certain point or mainstream, then
[01:51.880 --> 01:54.720]  how much worse is it that we don't know, George?
[01:54.720 --> 02:01.960]  Alex, it's George Orwell, it's 1984, except he was off by 20 years and I mean, here we
[02:01.960 --> 02:06.760]  are right in the middle of this, you know, when you hear stories that Homeland Security
[02:06.760 --> 02:12.520]  wants to monitor the social networks just to see if there's any potential of civil unrest.
[02:12.520 --> 02:16.480]  These are scary times that we're in right now.
[02:16.480 --> 02:20.760]  Technology is one of the main reasons these things have happened to us.
[02:20.760 --> 02:23.960]  What you've been able to do and what we've done on coast to coast, and by the way, we're
[02:23.960 --> 02:32.040]  a popping champagne because we've now hit 559 commercial radio station affiliates, just
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.560]  about unheard of.
[02:33.560 --> 02:39.000]  And you are right, we are number two in the world in terms of affiliate count and we're
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.440]  slowly creeping up and one day we'll be number one.
[02:42.440 --> 02:49.480]  But what's happening, I think the public has become aware, not only because of technology
[02:49.480 --> 02:56.040]  and social networks that move information faster and faster and faster, but they are
[02:56.040 --> 03:02.920]  also smart enough to realize that, you know what, we love our country, but you can't accept
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.560]  everything that government hands to us.
[03:06.560 --> 03:07.880]  You've got to question it.
[03:07.880 --> 03:14.000]  And if people had done this back in World War II, example Pearl Harbor, Vietnam, the
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.960]  Gulf of Tonk, Tonkin, and all these other different areas, they might have been able
[03:18.960 --> 03:24.160]  to stand up and say, look, enough is enough, what is going on here?
[03:24.160 --> 03:29.840]  And we find ourselves right now in the middle of all this with this vast amount of information
[03:29.840 --> 03:35.280]  out there at our disposal and people are becoming more aware of it.
[03:35.280 --> 03:39.440]  And that's what you're feeling, that's what I'm feeling, and that's what so many other
[03:39.440 --> 03:41.440]  people are feeling.
[03:41.440 --> 03:47.480]  Well, George, in fact, that was my next question for you.
[03:47.480 --> 03:49.440]  You see the awakening.
[03:49.440 --> 03:55.960]  You are a world-renowned analyst, media personality researcher, probably one of the best interviewers
[03:55.960 --> 03:59.600]  out there, bar none, probably even better than Larry King and his heyday.
[03:59.600 --> 04:04.080]  You have your finger on the pulse, so I know you're picking up what I'm picking up.
[04:04.080 --> 04:08.160]  I am a person who is well-known, especially because of the internet.
[04:08.160 --> 04:13.120]  And so anywhere I go, people stop me, and it's not every 10 or 15 people now, it's every
[04:13.120 --> 04:19.240]  three or four or five, no matter where I go, but they're always saying, nobody's waking
[04:19.240 --> 04:24.000]  up, we're in deep trouble, oh my God, it's all true, I really appreciate you.
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.440]  And so they don't understand that actually we are becoming the majority and more people
[04:29.440 --> 04:33.400]  are awake than they know because they're not George Norrie, they're not Alex Jones.
[04:33.400 --> 04:38.960]  There's only a handful of media personalities in the real media, in the reality, truth-based
[04:38.960 --> 04:44.520]  seeking media who are recognized.
[04:44.520 --> 04:50.080]  And so we get the feedback and see the awakening, but then people individually out there, they're
[04:50.080 --> 04:52.080]  awake but they feel like they're alone.
[04:52.080 --> 04:55.640]  I think that's why Coast to Coast is so important because people can actually hear and you have
[04:55.640 --> 05:00.200]  polls and people know then that they're not in the minority, they're not crazy, they're
[05:00.200 --> 05:01.200]  not cooks.
[05:01.200 --> 05:06.400]  Can you speak to that phenomenon from your incredible reach communicating and doing conferences
[05:06.400 --> 05:07.400]  all over the country?
[05:07.400 --> 05:13.120]  Well, first of all, I learned at a very early age, and I'm talking 19 years old when I first
[05:13.120 --> 05:15.480]  started working in broadcasting.
[05:15.480 --> 05:19.600]  I think I was on the other end of Marconi when he said, can anyone hear me?
[05:19.600 --> 05:26.560]  I think it was me who said, yeah, I can Mr. Marconi, but I learned Alex at a very young
[05:26.560 --> 05:33.560]  age that the success of a broadcaster was very simple, there was a simple formula here
[05:33.560 --> 05:40.720]  and that was get rid of your ego, it's not about you, it's about the story and it's about
[05:40.720 --> 05:43.880]  your listener or it's about your viewer.
[05:43.880 --> 05:48.760]  And one of the simple techniques that I do on a very regular basis because people say
[05:48.760 --> 05:54.200]  to me, my God, you're so in touch with stuff or you're so ahead of things, how do you do
[05:54.200 --> 05:55.200]  it?
[05:55.200 --> 05:57.640]  It's a simple formula.
[05:57.640 --> 06:04.120]  I go out regularly in the public, whether as you just said, it's a speaking engagement
[06:04.120 --> 06:11.880]  or whether it's a restaurant or shopping center or you name it, I go out there and I talk
[06:11.880 --> 06:15.360]  to people, I listen to what they have to say.
[06:15.360 --> 06:20.040]  And so, three years ago, somebody says, you know what, my company's going to lay me off,
[06:20.040 --> 06:24.840]  they're having trouble making sales, this has never happened before, and then you hear
[06:24.840 --> 06:29.360]  it from another person and another person and another person, well then you begin to
[06:29.360 --> 06:34.920]  realize there's a pattern here and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out.
[06:34.920 --> 06:40.000]  And so, we were miles ahead of the mainstream media when we started talking about the economic
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.840]  mess or the mortgage mess.
[06:42.840 --> 06:47.600]  People were saying, to me, I'm having trouble making my mortgage payments, I just can't
[06:47.600 --> 06:53.560]  do it anymore, way before anybody even knew about the derivative problems and things like
[06:53.560 --> 06:54.560]  that.
[06:54.560 --> 07:00.000]  So, eight years ago, talking about, you weren't calling it robo-signing, you had a guest on,
[07:00.000 --> 07:05.480]  that's actually, because I learned a lot from you, not vice versa, but years ago, you had
[07:05.480 --> 07:10.200]  a guest on about the mortgage fraud and taking houses they didn't have the paper on and that's
[07:10.200 --> 07:12.360]  only come out in the last year or two.
[07:12.360 --> 07:18.360]  Exactly, nobody believed us, nobody believed us, I mean, just recently the mainstream media
[07:18.360 --> 07:23.280]  now is beginning to pick up the things that you and I do and they're beginning to realize
[07:23.280 --> 07:27.600]  that, you know what, this might be a major story, there's something going on here.
[07:27.600 --> 07:34.760]  When we talked about, look, the SARS virus is not going to be a pandemic, the H1N1 virus
[07:34.760 --> 07:40.520]  is not going to wipe out society, it's a push to sell vaccines, folks, back off.
[07:40.520 --> 07:47.520]  And they had like 200 cases worldwide and I'm going, this is ludicrous, we get 36,000
[07:47.520 --> 07:53.320]  deaths a year just in the United States from the so-called seasonal flu and that's what
[07:53.320 --> 08:00.600]  they think we have and I'm saying, if there's any pandemic, it's the seasonal regular flu,
[08:00.600 --> 08:04.960]  it's not all this other bunk that they're throwing at us and so what we've done on
[08:04.960 --> 08:10.680]  coast to coast, whether the stories are paranormal like my book that just came out talking to
[08:10.680 --> 08:17.760]  the dead or UFOs or Bigfoot, we're also into alternative medicine, we're in the cutting
[08:17.760 --> 08:23.520]  edge science and we're in the mainstream news stories with what I call the coast to coast
[08:23.520 --> 08:24.520]  twist.
[08:24.520 --> 08:29.920]  Last night, I had Jerry Corsi on for an hour talking about the rumblings that Israel is
[08:29.920 --> 08:36.280]  looking for, some internal support to go after Iran and that's another issue, I'm not going
[08:36.280 --> 08:41.160]  to talk about the justification of Iran, I think that harbor terrorism and something
[08:41.160 --> 08:46.760]  needs to be done and most Iranians, by the way, who live in that country want a pro-western
[08:46.760 --> 08:51.760]  type of life, they love America and a lot of people don't understand that but it's
[08:51.760 --> 08:57.480]  these mollusks who are taking over that are doing all these horrendous things but we are
[08:57.480 --> 09:04.040]  picking up stories like that and I had Corsi on last night talking about how we are on
[09:04.040 --> 09:11.040]  the verge of a military intervention against Iran and then we talked about the ramifications
[09:11.040 --> 09:18.720]  of that, you know, Israel has nukes, we have nukes, Iran has missiles, not nukes yet but
[09:18.720 --> 09:24.840]  maybe they do, who knows, those stories will start popping up, Alex, I guarantee you within
[09:24.840 --> 09:31.360]  the next week or two on the mainstream media, Matt Drudge, whom I think the rule of is also
[09:31.360 --> 09:36.760]  on the cutting edge of all this, he's in our club, he's the one who's also up there sticking
[09:36.760 --> 09:42.440]  his neck in the news, getting these stories out to the public and, you know, I just think
[09:42.440 --> 09:48.680]  that people like you and Drudge and the things that we do on coast to coast are so critical
[09:48.680 --> 09:54.600]  to allow people who are listening to make a decision to stand up, to put their foot
[09:54.600 --> 09:59.080]  down and say, you know what, I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.
[09:59.080 --> 10:05.120]  Well, I agree with you George and there really is a club, I would say George Norrie, Matt
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.640]  Drudge, Alex Jones, I mean, who else is there on a huge scale, I guess some of the other
[10:10.640 --> 10:16.920]  coast to coast host Ian Punnett and others, who else is out there actually even raising
[10:16.920 --> 10:20.280]  real issues, people sometimes call me and they say, well, you know, they get into some
[10:20.280 --> 10:26.160]  wild stuff on coast to coasting but I can't quit listening to it and I'm like, regardless,
[10:26.160 --> 10:31.360]  it's healthy to talk and explore everything and 10 years ago, I didn't have this view
[10:31.360 --> 10:34.800]  now as I've learned a little because it gets you to think about other things and have an
[10:34.800 --> 10:35.920]  open mind.
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.440]  It's the closed minds that are the big problem that we face as a society and then I realize
[10:41.440 --> 10:46.680]  things I talk about, even though I know they're documented and true, other people just aren't
[10:46.680 --> 10:52.080]  ready to be able to face it and deal with it and so I want to bring you to, I mean,
[10:52.080 --> 10:56.480]  I want to get into the whole new world order and the Vatican calling for world government
[10:56.480 --> 11:01.000]  and global regulations, global currency, which means global tax.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.120]  So don't let me forget to get to that with you, George, but let's get into UFOs now because
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.720]  no one can deny that back when Art Bell was pioneering really deep discussion of this
[11:09.720 --> 11:13.040]  type of stuff and we're on a planet, we know there's all sorts of weird stuff going on,
[11:13.040 --> 11:17.360]  it's in the Bible, it's in the Sumerian text, they got helicopters carved on the side of
[11:17.360 --> 11:20.480]  the pyramids, you know, down the tombs, we know there's a lot of stuff we don't know
[11:20.480 --> 11:27.080]  that's going on, we have knowledge of very limited spectrum, but now with government
[11:27.080 --> 11:31.720]  coming out more and more, now with speaking of the Vatican saying get ready for something
[11:31.720 --> 11:37.880]  and contact, from here in the middle of it, like nobody else, focusing on this every day,
[11:37.880 --> 11:43.280]  do you think they're getting ready to disclose something or to stage something, to try to
[11:43.280 --> 11:48.440]  unify the planet as some government documents and world leaders have talked about?
[11:48.440 --> 11:57.120]  If you had to crystallize it, what's going on with the off-world or on-world life forms?
[11:57.120 --> 12:02.080]  A couple of years ago, I was at a conference in Washington, D.C., that Steve Bassett had
[12:02.080 --> 12:08.720]  put on, it's an exo-politics on UFOs and Steve has been a guest when I was doing my little
[12:08.720 --> 12:14.320]  local St. Louis show back in 1997, he's been a regular guest on Coast to Coast, he believes
[12:14.320 --> 12:19.680]  that government will eventually disclose, well he and I are at odds on that, I've told
[12:19.680 --> 12:25.800]  him that no uncertain terms will government come forward and tell us that we are being
[12:25.800 --> 12:32.880]  visited by extraterrestrials, they just won't do it, they fear collapse, loss of control
[12:32.880 --> 12:40.360]  and everything else, be that as it may, whistleblowers, those within government continue to come forward
[12:40.360 --> 12:46.480]  to say things like Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell claiming that yes, we're being visited,
[12:46.480 --> 12:51.760]  they do exist and this is what's happening, so that is going on and that's going to get
[12:51.760 --> 12:57.920]  bigger and bigger and bigger, now you talk about a false flag, Project Bluebeam is supposed
[12:57.920 --> 13:04.360]  to be a government program where they will one day send holographic images of UFOs over
[13:04.360 --> 13:09.280]  major cities in the United States, much like the movie Independence Day, where we would
[13:09.280 --> 13:15.160]  see these craft one day and panic and say please government, save us, please help us,
[13:15.160 --> 13:21.120]  do whatever you have to do, then there comes martial law and more control and everything
[13:21.120 --> 13:27.760]  else, there's that possibility that a plan like that is there somewhere on the table
[13:27.760 --> 13:33.600]  ready to be implemented in the next year or two, probably not, but I think it's out there,
[13:33.600 --> 13:38.800]  but to answer that question about disclosure, it ain't going to happen, I think we're being
[13:38.800 --> 13:44.360]  visited, this is a vast universe, I think one is foolish to think that we are alone
[13:44.360 --> 13:49.920]  in the universe, as Walter Sullivan from the New York Times once wrote many, many years
[13:49.920 --> 13:56.960]  ago, we are not alone and we're not, there are other inhabitants out there, they've learned
[13:56.960 --> 14:02.360]  different kinds of propulsion, they're not coming here the way we've zoom around in space
[14:02.360 --> 14:07.720]  and they've learned how to bend space-time and they've come here and why not, this is
[14:07.720 --> 14:14.000]  a gorgeous planet, this is so teeming with life, my gosh, you go outside and you look
[14:14.000 --> 14:22.000]  at everything that's out there, that's alive, but this is just a utopia and I think other
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.160]  inhabitants are coming here going, this place is unbelievable, what a great place to visit.
[14:27.160 --> 14:31.840]  Well every culture out there says that's happening, I've never really gotten into those areas
[14:31.840 --> 14:37.200]  just because I can't get people to admit there's FEMA camps when it's in the Houston Chronicle.
[14:37.200 --> 14:38.200]  Exactly.
[14:38.200 --> 14:44.320]  But undoubtedly, this is a wide, wide universe and a lot of stuff is going on and life was
[14:44.320 --> 14:49.600]  probably seated on this planet because you don't find a fine Swiss wristwatch out in
[14:49.600 --> 14:53.560]  the middle of the desert that got put together by the sands bumping up against each other.
[14:53.560 --> 14:57.680]  George, let's talk about an issue I've never raised with you and then I want to get your
[14:57.680 --> 15:04.160]  perspective on, I know a lot of NASA people, people that I've seen in the films of NASA
[15:04.160 --> 15:08.720]  on the front control system, you know, on NASA One, not even in the backup, I know the
[15:08.720 --> 15:13.880]  fellow who ran the RCA cameras on the moon, he said, no, we were on the moon, but he even
[15:13.880 --> 15:18.000]  showed me his national security letters, I've known him about 15 years, Raymond Tigg, and
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.080]  he told me some stuff privately, said he'd say it on air, once he got on air, he thought
[15:22.080 --> 15:25.880]  he was, he had a lot of heart trouble at the time and he's still alive, but he thought
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.160]  he was going to die soon, so he told me some on air, but then I've talked to other people
[15:30.160 --> 15:35.840]  in NASA and they say, basically, there is some manipulation going on, but it's to cover
[15:35.840 --> 15:43.200]  up the real technologies that the U.S. government has, I mean, look how advanced the Germans
[15:43.200 --> 15:46.880]  were at the end of World War II, I mean, they still say the SR-71 Blackbirds, the fastest
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.880]  plane we've got, we see the stealth helicopter crash, but he wouldn't go all the way, but
[15:51.880 --> 15:57.120]  he basically said, we've been to the moon and more, and some of the stuff you saw that
[15:57.120 --> 16:03.000]  looked like fakery, that is just basically stuff for public consumption, but that the
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.800]  space program is way more advanced, then I talked to Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head
[16:06.800 --> 16:11.520]  of Star Wars program, and he said, well, it's classified, but yes, you know, we had drones
[16:11.520 --> 16:17.680]  in space with DU Sabo, political decapitation systems, you know, to kill major government's
[16:17.680 --> 16:22.840]  leaders in an hour in the 70s, you know, Star Wars didn't really start in the 80s, so there's
[16:22.840 --> 16:26.160]  my preface there, what is your view on the space program?
[16:26.160 --> 16:29.440]  You're claiming it's basically over now, I mean, what's going on here?
[16:29.440 --> 16:35.520]  I will paraphrase a coast-to-coast guest in our science advisor, Richard C. Coglan, who
[16:35.520 --> 16:42.280]  heads up his own website called EnterpriseMission.com, but which he believes that there is another
[16:42.280 --> 16:48.920]  project up there in space that we don't know anything about, that is a Black Ops program
[16:48.920 --> 16:54.400]  and that they've been up there for a long, long time, maybe they've still gone to the
[16:54.400 --> 17:01.440]  moon, who knows, but that they have conducted and have continued to conduct various experiments,
[17:01.440 --> 17:05.400]  surveillance techniques, you name it, up there in space.
[17:05.400 --> 17:10.560]  There is no doubt in my mind, Alex, that with the kind of technology we possess in the United
[17:10.560 --> 17:17.720]  States that we have utilized space for incredible things, and we don't, as the American public,
[17:17.720 --> 17:21.360]  understand or know about, I mean, is that smart?
[17:21.360 --> 17:26.520]  Well, let's say if I were president of this country and I needed to protect everybody
[17:26.520 --> 17:32.200]  here, I would probably approve some kind of Black Ops program as well.
[17:32.200 --> 17:37.760]  The danger with all of that, however, is what happens when you get someone else who is not
[17:37.760 --> 17:44.600]  as caring, not as thoughtful about people, but happens to be more concerned about control
[17:44.600 --> 17:48.800]  and manipulation and staying in office for the rest of his life.
[17:48.800 --> 17:52.480]  That's the problem with everything that's going on right now.
[17:52.480 --> 17:58.400]  I admit problems, you know, personally, going through airport security and having them check
[17:58.400 --> 18:01.520]  me out and having them say, you know what, you're clean as a whistle.
[18:01.520 --> 18:08.080]  I feel safe on a plane when they do that, but what happens one day when that government
[18:08.080 --> 18:13.000]  decides, look, we're going to kick it up a notch or two, we're going to do this for
[18:13.000 --> 18:18.160]  control, we're going to go buy their houses, and we're going to take infrared scopes of
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.720]  everybody inside, and they won't even know we're outside, and we can see what they're
[18:22.720 --> 18:29.280]  doing in their house, we can watch what they're watching on TV, and we will control everything.
[18:29.280 --> 18:34.240]  We know where they put their guns, so we know where to go at any given time.
[18:34.240 --> 18:35.880]  That is the danger.
[18:35.880 --> 18:36.880]  That is the danger.
[18:36.880 --> 18:37.880]  That's already happening.
[18:37.880 --> 18:42.440]  I knew about that 15 years ago, now MIT is announcing it, but you just hit the heart
[18:42.440 --> 18:43.440]  of it.
[18:43.440 --> 18:47.280]  From the people I've talked to, and they admit that over 90% of space programs classified
[18:47.280 --> 18:53.040]  military, that they early on sold it on, we've got to dominate space, we've got volunteers
[18:53.040 --> 18:57.000]  that are ready to die, but we can't have all these people dying on the space program in
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.720]  front of all the little old ladies, we'll have the public space program to fund everything,
[19:01.720 --> 19:06.720]  but then we'll have the real space program going on, and that's basically what I've been
[19:06.720 --> 19:11.680]  told by some pretty high-level people, and then Buzz Aldrin came on and said, yeah, the
[19:11.680 --> 19:17.000]  pyramids, yeah, something designed them, yeah, there's an obelisk on the moon of Mars, and
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.200]  then I heard there was a fracas over that, but I was at Charlie Sheen's house, and this
[19:21.200 --> 19:22.200]  is a true story.
[19:22.200 --> 19:25.840]  Buzz Aldrin can be asked this, because I've asked him back on for whatever reason, even
[19:25.840 --> 19:29.840]  though his secretary said, oh, we love you, we like you, he's ready to come back on, yeah,
[19:29.840 --> 19:32.480]  we like what you're doing, and then later he wouldn't come back on, it's been about
[19:32.480 --> 19:36.040]  two years, and I'm telling my producers, go after Buzz Aldrin, but I'm publicly bringing
[19:36.040 --> 19:37.120]  this out.
[19:37.120 --> 19:42.160]  On that interview, just type in Buzz Aldrin, talks about monolith on the moon, and it'll
[19:42.160 --> 19:43.160]  come up.
[19:43.160 --> 19:46.160]  He said some really wild stuff, never heard him say anywhere else.
[19:46.160 --> 19:51.720]  I'm at Charlie Sheen's house, this is like a year ago, right before the whole meltdown,
[19:51.720 --> 19:55.960]  all this, and he goes, hold on, Buzz Aldrin's calling, we're going out to dinner in a couple
[19:55.960 --> 19:59.680]  of nights, too bad you're not going to be here, and he answers it, and it's on record
[19:59.680 --> 20:03.640]  on TMZ, he caught Buzz Aldrin and him at dinner a couple of days after I left.
[20:03.640 --> 20:07.680]  Point is, Buzz Aldrin, and he goes, hold on, I'm going to put you on speaker, I got my
[20:07.680 --> 20:11.920]  friend here, puts him on speaker, iPhone, sitting her outside looking overlooking the
[20:11.920 --> 20:16.800]  Hollywood Hills, Charlie Sheen's backyard in Beverly Hills, and it's Buzz Aldrin going,
[20:16.800 --> 20:20.200]  yeah, great, well sure, I heard you want to go out to eat with me, all right, because
[20:20.200 --> 20:23.760]  Charlie likes to go out with interesting people to dinner, and he goes, all right, yeah, sure,
[20:23.760 --> 20:27.600]  how about a couple of days, let me check with this and that, and he goes, but let me tell
[20:27.600 --> 20:33.360]  you something, so they talk for about 15 minutes, and he knows we're on speaker, and he says,
[20:33.360 --> 20:37.680]  let me tell you, in two months, they're going to announce water was found on the moon, I've
[20:37.680 --> 20:41.200]  known this for a long time, but now I'm going to tell you Charlie, we'll talk about it at
[20:41.200 --> 20:43.920]  once, yeah, they're going to claim the Indians found it, yeah, yeah, they're going to do
[20:43.920 --> 20:49.240]  all this, and I'm sitting there hearing this, and I even told my wife about it, and Charlie
[20:49.240 --> 20:53.400]  could tell the story, and then Buzz hung up, and then it wasn't two months, it was about
[20:53.400 --> 20:58.440]  four months later, they announced, water found on the moon, Indians find it, so I mean, right
[20:58.440 --> 21:02.240]  there, I got a window into something crazy, I'm sorry, I'm supposed to be interviewing
[21:02.240 --> 21:05.880]  George Norrie, but I mean, I'm asking you, what do you make of that?
[21:05.880 --> 21:12.000]  Well, first of all, Buzz is a great American, and one very different kind of guy, and you
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.280]  know, he took a swing at a guy who wanted them to pledge on the Bible that we never
[21:16.280 --> 21:21.160]  went to the moon, when these guys all risked their lives to do whatever they had to do,
[21:21.160 --> 21:25.320]  so he's a different guy, I was on the Larry King Show, Alex with Buzz a couple years
[21:25.320 --> 21:29.520]  ago, and we were going to talk about UFOs and everything else, and I'm on with a group
[21:29.520 --> 21:34.800]  of other people, and Larry turns to Buzz, and he says, now tell us, what did you see,
[21:34.800 --> 21:40.200]  and then the story had to do with, did the Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz
[21:40.200 --> 21:46.640]  Aldrin, did they see a UFO trailing them as they were going to the moon, and Buzz just
[21:46.640 --> 21:51.840]  completely ignored the question and started talking about the capsule and how things
[21:51.840 --> 21:56.960]  work and separate and stuff, and I'm looking at Larry going, Larry, push him, get him,
[21:56.960 --> 22:03.920]  get the answer, let's do it, and Buzz just never would go there, but he's a different
[22:03.920 --> 22:08.880]  kind of guy, and I think the NASA guys are all different, and I keep citing Edgar Mitchell,
[22:08.880 --> 22:13.160]  whom I know well, and I've been to events with him, and I've sat down to dinner with
[22:13.160 --> 22:17.640]  him, and he tells me, he says, George, I'm going to tell you something, I haven't seen
[22:17.640 --> 22:24.040]  anything weird on the moon, but I'm told by people within government that we're being
[22:24.040 --> 22:29.240]  visited, strange things are going on, and he said, I believe these people, and I told
[22:29.240 --> 22:36.440]  him, and I believe you, Edgar, and that's the way it is, Ingo Swan, who was the father
[22:36.440 --> 22:43.680]  of remote viewing, who was set up by the US government, the military, to set up a remote
[22:43.680 --> 22:49.360]  viewing program, so we could spy on the Soviets at the time, he remote viewed the backside
[22:49.360 --> 22:55.360]  of the moon, and he contends that there are structures on the moon, that there are things
[22:55.360 --> 23:03.440]  there, and you know, if this universe is indeed 14 billion years old, and our solar system
[23:03.440 --> 23:11.600]  is 4.5 billion years old, there's a high likelihood that that moon has been used as a stomping
[23:11.600 --> 23:16.320]  off ground, as a base, but the other thing that a lot of people don't understand, Alex,
[23:16.320 --> 23:22.920]  and that's why we turn to people like Michael Cremo, forbidden archeologist, this is an old,
[23:22.920 --> 23:30.320]  old planet, and our civilization, our humankind that we know of is merely a couple thousand
[23:30.320 --> 23:31.320]  years old.
[23:31.320 --> 23:34.760]  Yeah, I mean it's been around like less than a second in the scheme of time.
[23:34.760 --> 23:42.160]  Yeah, exactly, I think we have had high technology civilizations that built the pyramids, that
[23:42.160 --> 23:47.560]  even go back beyond that, that probably had flying machines in India, they talk about
[23:47.560 --> 23:48.560]  the Glamrs.
[23:48.560 --> 23:53.240]  No, it's all, but that's what's incredible about Buzz, and if you ever get him on, ask
[23:53.240 --> 23:54.240]  him about this.
[23:54.240 --> 23:57.320]  Hey, you were in a conversation with Charlie Sheen Alex Jones, and I was just sitting there
[23:57.320 --> 24:03.240]  drinking coffee, listening to this, but again, Buzz was saying, oh, we've always known, we
[24:03.240 --> 24:06.360]  kept it secret, but now I can talk about it, it's going to come out in a few months.
[24:06.360 --> 24:12.880]  That was nowhere on the news, and so my point is, there was a window into Buzz Aldrin when
[24:12.880 --> 24:17.280]  he wasn't being guarded, admitting that they knew there was water, and then that was a
[24:17.280 --> 24:20.360]  big breaking national story, and I almost went on air.
[24:20.360 --> 24:23.760]  I told my wife, should I tell that story, and she goes, that'll sound crazy.
[24:23.760 --> 24:29.000]  But the thing is, is that the NASA knew that, why did they let India announce it?
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.760]  Why did they keep it secret for 40 years?
[24:31.760 --> 24:36.560]  You know what, I think they have a timetable to release information.
[24:36.560 --> 24:43.000]  If they go out right away and say, there is water on the moon, or there are structures
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.520]  on Mars, you know, people may say, well, what are we spending money to go see if there's
[24:47.520 --> 24:49.240]  water on the moon?
[24:49.240 --> 24:53.840]  And you know, I think that's another reason, there's an economic reason for holding back
[24:53.840 --> 25:00.000]  information so they can continue their budgets and their projects and keep things going.
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.960]  And you know, because to me, it's a no-brainer, there's water on the moon, that's a great
[25:03.960 --> 25:10.760]  story, tell us, you know, this is not the grand deception, but I just think that they
[25:10.760 --> 25:16.640]  think that if we know too much, we're going to say, okay, on to the next project, no need
[25:16.640 --> 25:22.520]  to send this probe to the moon to look for water when you already have told us it's there.
[25:22.520 --> 25:23.520]  Next?
[25:23.520 --> 25:25.120]  Well, here's my question, George.
[25:25.120 --> 25:26.320]  What else is going on?
[25:26.320 --> 25:29.640]  Because I've seen that on mainstream news, where they play the tapes of the astronauts
[25:29.640 --> 25:32.360]  saying our capsule's being followed and all this stuff.
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.280]  And I've seen the NASA footage of like, beams shooting into space and things flying around.
[25:36.280 --> 25:39.720]  I mean, the point is, what else don't we know then?
[25:39.720 --> 25:41.760]  They won't even tell us basic stuff.
[25:41.760 --> 25:44.400]  I mean, here's the thing about Aldrin, he's on the show, I'm not even bringing this stuff
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.200]  up and he goes, we can find the clip, actually, he's like, yeah, you know, who do you think
[25:48.200 --> 25:49.200]  built the pyramids?
[25:49.200 --> 25:53.600]  That stuff's all over, yeah, that's what we're talking about, obelisk.
[25:53.600 --> 25:56.000]  That's where we need to land, Alex, on that moon.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.480]  And I'm like, Buzz, I mean, it's not even a UFO show and he's, I mean, maybe he brought
[26:00.480 --> 26:03.720]  it up because I didn't bring UFOs up, I don't know.
[26:03.720 --> 26:07.600]  This is one of the things that fuels coast to coast, Alex.
[26:07.600 --> 26:09.400]  It fuels your program too.
[26:09.400 --> 26:13.920]  We deal with the mysteries of the universe.
[26:13.920 --> 26:19.520]  People have an opportunity to sit back and think, yeah, I have businesses on all the
[26:19.520 --> 26:23.000]  time and I always ask them, tell me about the Big Bang.
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.600]  How did some little minuscule particle blow up and we have all this mass?
[26:29.600 --> 26:30.600]  How did this happen?
[26:30.600 --> 26:34.320]  And you know what, I've still not been given a good answer.
[26:34.320 --> 26:39.480]  There's just more mysteries out there than I think will ever, ever uncover.
[26:39.480 --> 26:45.400]  Well, George, scientists all the time, you know, 500 years ago or 600, they thought the
[26:45.400 --> 26:46.600]  earth was still flat.
[26:46.600 --> 26:48.000]  That was absolute fact.
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.600]  I'm not saying that our quantum mechanics experts, physicists, to 100 years ago weren't
[26:53.600 --> 26:58.560]  smart, like Max Planck and of course, Einstein, but he said you couldn't have a faster than
[26:58.560 --> 27:02.680]  light particle and they've now repeatedly proven that they've got faster than light
[27:02.680 --> 27:03.680]  particles.
[27:03.680 --> 27:07.040]  I mean, the truth is, we don't know one one billionth of what's going on.
[27:07.040 --> 27:11.240]  Alex, I'm convinced that when you're on coast to coast, even you are faster than light
[27:11.240 --> 27:12.960]  when you're on the show.
[27:12.960 --> 27:15.920]  Oh, man, the show does go fast.
[27:15.920 --> 27:20.440]  You know, I've had you almost 30 minutes and I know you said you'd say 30, 45, I know
[27:20.440 --> 27:24.960]  you're a very busy man and I know you've got a four hour show coming up tonight and I've
[27:24.960 --> 27:28.560]  got a lot of callers, but they were from earlier, so I'll get to them after you go.
[27:28.560 --> 27:30.360]  Can you stay 10 more minutes with us, George?
[27:30.360 --> 27:31.360]  Sure, love to.
[27:31.360 --> 27:33.680]  I've been asking a lot of the questions here, George.
[27:33.680 --> 27:36.440]  How about Alex Jones actually shuts up?
[27:36.440 --> 27:38.880]  This will be like an eclipse, a very rare event.
[27:38.880 --> 27:40.680]  What is on George Norris' mind?
[27:40.680 --> 27:43.960]  What are you most passionate about right now in your research?
[27:43.960 --> 27:44.960]  What's coming up tonight?
[27:44.960 --> 27:50.480]  Well, tonight, you know, on the program we're talking about, you know, the search for Atlantis
[27:50.480 --> 27:58.480]  and again, classic coast to coast type shows, but what I have a passion for, Alex, is just
[27:58.480 --> 28:00.520]  trying to find the truth.
[28:00.520 --> 28:07.840]  Wherever it is, wherever it might take us, good or bad, I want us to know the truth and
[28:07.840 --> 28:16.120]  I want this planet to understand that our rule here is to make human beings a little
[28:16.120 --> 28:19.280]  more comfortable and to stop the oppression.
[28:19.280 --> 28:21.600]  Look, I'm all for a great military.
[28:21.600 --> 28:23.040]  I spent nine years in the Navy.
[28:23.040 --> 28:28.640]  I think we should have and continue to have the strongest defense that this planet can
[28:28.640 --> 28:29.640]  muster.
[28:29.640 --> 28:35.080]  We should have all the technology that is available to us, but our rule should be to
[28:35.080 --> 28:41.440]  go into countries where people are being suppressed and get rid of those low life dictators and
[28:41.440 --> 28:46.880]  make these planets better for people and that's what our rule should be.
[28:46.880 --> 28:52.120]  We shouldn't be occupying, taking over, we shouldn't be an aggressor, we should merely
[28:52.120 --> 28:57.480]  be taking care of people who are oppressed and who could argue with that?
[28:57.480 --> 29:02.800]  If you hear that 200,000 people have been murdered by some bookkeeper, it's our job
[29:02.800 --> 29:04.640]  to go in and take that guy out.
[29:04.640 --> 29:07.400]  Nobody's going to want to do with you about that.
[29:07.400 --> 29:12.280]  That's what this planet is supposed to be doing for each other, providing food and security
[29:12.280 --> 29:13.280]  and comfort.
[29:13.280 --> 29:19.560]  If you believe in life after death and a hereafter and if you're very spiritual, then you know
[29:19.560 --> 29:24.720]  what we're here for and that's our rule on the planet and that's what I want to do with
[29:24.720 --> 29:25.720]  this program.
[29:25.720 --> 29:31.160]  I want people, when they listen to coast to coast, to be entertained, to be informed,
[29:31.160 --> 29:33.120]  to cry, to laugh.
[29:33.120 --> 29:37.040]  I want that passion and it appears to be working for us.
[29:37.040 --> 29:39.400]  It's getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[29:39.400 --> 29:44.680]  We've got what we call the Coast Insiders Club now, Alex, where we charge folks less
[29:44.680 --> 29:50.480]  than a 25 cents a day to be a member of it where they can get downloads and podcasting
[29:50.480 --> 29:51.480]  for past programs.
[29:51.480 --> 29:57.640]  But more importantly, they become part of a family and I'm through the death that we've
[29:57.640 --> 30:03.680]  been able to do things like that at pennies on the dollar to help people and that's what
[30:03.680 --> 30:05.280]  we're going to continue to do.
[30:05.280 --> 30:07.480]  I have no plans to retire.
[30:07.480 --> 30:13.880]  I mean, I'm approaching next year, my 10th year doing coast to coast and I'm going to
[30:13.880 --> 30:19.360]  keep doing it until one day we go to a commercial break and my producer, Tom Vanheiser, comes
[30:19.360 --> 30:22.920]  on the air and says, George, just passed away.
[30:22.920 --> 30:25.160]  That's the way I want to go out.
[30:25.160 --> 30:28.520]  Oh man, that's an amazing way to put it.
[30:28.520 --> 30:32.320]  Well, that's what passion is all about and so you'll probably live to be about 100 if
[30:32.320 --> 30:34.520]  that's your view of the world.
[30:34.520 --> 30:36.520]  I'm already 100.
[30:36.520 --> 30:42.120]  Look, oh yeah, you've got a long way to go to 100, so do I.
[30:42.120 --> 30:43.120]  We'll get there.
[30:43.120 --> 30:47.360]  George, out of all the shows you've done, what are some of your favorites?
[30:47.360 --> 30:50.800]  Oh, you know what, I love them all.
[30:50.800 --> 30:54.400]  I can't pick one because I enjoy every one.
[30:54.400 --> 30:57.880]  They're all different for me and I learn all the time.
[30:57.880 --> 31:01.880]  Alex, I've got to tell you, when I first started doing coast to coast, people were talking
[31:01.880 --> 31:05.680]  about a one world government or talking about you.
[31:05.680 --> 31:08.240]  I didn't know what the heck they were talking about.
[31:08.240 --> 31:10.240]  I studied it myself.
[31:10.240 --> 31:16.760]  This program has been a learning curve for me too and so the audience comes along with
[31:16.760 --> 31:21.640]  me for one heck of a ride and we're going to learn something tonight whether we talk
[31:21.640 --> 31:28.720]  to a physicist or a psychic or a paranormal investigator, you name it, we'll do it.
[31:28.720 --> 31:33.720]  I had a great time Monday night on our ghost to ghost Halloween show and it was fun to hear
[31:33.720 --> 31:38.880]  these kinds of stories from people but at the same time the next day or two, I'm talking
[31:38.880 --> 31:44.360]  about the possibility of rule of the land, that's important to me too.
[31:44.360 --> 31:50.360]  Well, George, put it to you this way because that's a great answer but what is your favorite
[31:50.360 --> 31:51.360]  topic?
[31:51.360 --> 31:56.160]  I mean, has it changed day to day but what area of the investigation of reality, the
[31:56.160 --> 32:02.280]  search for truth, the search for the mysteries, what area is the most exhilarating, the most
[32:02.280 --> 32:04.240]  exciting for you?
[32:04.240 --> 32:05.240]  You know what?
[32:05.240 --> 32:08.160]  I cannot be specific, Alex, and that's the God's truth.
[32:08.160 --> 32:09.400]  I love them all.
[32:09.400 --> 32:11.440]  I mean, I love alternative medicine.
[32:11.440 --> 32:16.000]  I love making sure that people can heal themselves with natural things.
[32:16.000 --> 32:21.680]  I like the fact that you have big foot investigators that go out, they're trying to find big foot.
[32:21.680 --> 32:26.600]  So, you know, every show that we do, I find fascinating.
[32:26.600 --> 32:31.760]  So if you were to say to me, as you've just done, what's your favorite topic, they are.
[32:31.760 --> 32:35.120]  My favorite topic is doing coast to coast.
[32:35.120 --> 32:37.840]  It's clearly, simply, that's what it is.
[32:37.840 --> 32:42.000]  Well, I've got to say this, I mean, a few people, I'm so honored to actually interview
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  George Norrie.
[32:43.000 --> 32:46.800]  I know George doesn't do a ton of interviews, he does speaking engagements, but we're talking
[32:46.800 --> 32:51.320]  to somebody who really actually talks to tens of millions of people a day, soon to be the
[32:51.320 --> 32:56.400]  biggest radio show in the world, to eclipse Rush Limbaugh, just, and I think if you have
[32:56.400 --> 33:00.160]  the internet and everything else, you're probably bigger but as you were saying, you were within
[33:00.160 --> 33:04.600]  a, you know, just a hair's breath, you have 559 stations.
[33:04.600 --> 33:08.840]  In many areas, you have more than half the total radio listening audience.
[33:08.840 --> 33:18.760]  I mean, in this universe of fractured media and a million different choices, George Norrie
[33:18.760 --> 33:24.520]  has just done incredible things and his AM radio has gone through changes and decline
[33:24.520 --> 33:29.520]  in audience, you've only increased and Art Bell's a master of radio.
[33:29.520 --> 33:34.240]  I mean, even when I agreed with him or disagreed with him, the voice, the way he really was
[33:34.240 --> 33:40.160]  in the room with you, nobody can top that, but to see you take the show and top it in
[33:40.160 --> 33:45.280]  other ways and to take it even further, I mean, it's no brag, it's no fact, it's no
[33:45.280 --> 33:51.640]  butt-kissing here, George, I just marvel at your professionalism and how you just deliver
[33:51.640 --> 33:59.520]  insightful questions, how you draw out things and how you've taken that show that, I mean,
[33:59.520 --> 34:03.200]  people were marveling, nobody could top and I've got to say, you've taken it two or three
[34:03.200 --> 34:04.280]  or four different levels.
[34:04.280 --> 34:07.480]  I mean, back eight years ago, when you started interviewing myself and others, you've been
[34:07.480 --> 34:11.560]  doing it 10 years now, but eight years, nine years ago when you fully took it over, George,
[34:11.560 --> 34:14.000]  and I always talk about this because it's so true.
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.280]  No one on a forum like that that you could call mainstream was covering alternative things
[34:19.280 --> 34:23.360]  that were in the back alleys of the internet, and that's what I want to close this out with
[34:23.360 --> 34:25.880]  at any other point you want to raise.
[34:25.880 --> 34:30.280]  Why did you decide, not just with Alex Jones, because you've told that story, but with other
[34:30.280 --> 34:35.200]  people to take the risk, you know, here you are, you've got one of the most powerful platforms
[34:35.200 --> 34:40.160]  in the world, and to go in a direction and model states health emergency powers act.
[34:40.160 --> 34:44.960]  I was only reaching 300, 400, 500,000 people a day then, not two, three million.
[34:44.960 --> 34:46.920]  I mean, I couldn't say I beat that.
[34:46.920 --> 34:52.440]  Everybody I talked to in 2002, 2003, with a public government plan to prepare forced
[34:52.440 --> 34:56.200]  inoculations, you were the show that overturned that.
[34:56.200 --> 34:57.880]  You had to have heat on you for that.
[34:57.880 --> 35:04.440]  I mean, so many things that you literally trailblazed on with a platform that big, A,
[35:04.440 --> 35:08.600]  why did you do it, B, how did you, I mean, I know that they don't tell you what to say
[35:08.600 --> 35:12.320]  or do, but I guess, I mean, I mean, this is a international platform.
[35:12.320 --> 35:16.680]  How did you cover such topics when no one else had been able to do it before?
[35:16.680 --> 35:21.640]  I realized, Alex, that it was the right thing to do.
[35:21.640 --> 35:27.400]  I had to get to a point where I said, this is more important than money.
[35:27.400 --> 35:33.680]  It's more important than my career, and I'm going to do what I think is the right thing
[35:33.680 --> 35:34.680]  to do.
[35:34.680 --> 35:39.200]  And God help me, if it doesn't work for me, then I'm toast here.
[35:39.200 --> 35:45.440]  But if it does work, it gets bigger and stronger, and that's what we're going to do.
[35:45.440 --> 35:46.840]  And I did it.
[35:46.840 --> 35:52.920]  And I don't know if I was lucky or fortunate or divine providence stepped in, but it got
[35:52.920 --> 35:55.560]  bigger and bigger and bigger.
[35:55.560 --> 36:02.040]  And people now realize that they have to have this coast to coast fix, because every day
[36:02.040 --> 36:07.480]  it affects people in some form or fashion, whether it's a truck driver who's carrying
[36:07.480 --> 36:13.600]  cargo to keep this country going, or a security guard, or a great cop, and there are a lot
[36:13.600 --> 36:17.760]  of good ones out there in spite of what we see sometimes in the media.
[36:17.760 --> 36:21.840]  There are a lot of great people out there that are looking for some answers for their
[36:21.840 --> 36:24.120]  own specific lives.
[36:24.120 --> 36:27.200]  And that's what I want to do, and that's my mission.
[36:27.200 --> 36:29.400]  Well, that's beautiful.
[36:29.400 --> 36:33.880]  So I've heard you speak of this, but in other subjects, basically George Norrie goes with
[36:33.880 --> 36:34.880]  his gut.
[36:34.880 --> 36:39.880]  Your gut said, go out on the limb, and that's the success story that you put it all on the
[36:39.880 --> 36:40.880]  line.
[36:40.880 --> 36:45.840]  Here you are after decades winning the highest awards in TV, radio, you've got the big national
[36:45.840 --> 36:52.400]  show, and you take it in a new direction, basically a 90 degree turn.
[36:52.400 --> 36:56.640]  You still covered a lot of the same issues, but added all this in, and really took on
[36:56.640 --> 36:59.440]  serious pertinent political issues.
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.480]  That's why, I mean, I've got to give you kudos, and folks know I don't just hand out kudos.
[37:03.480 --> 37:08.200]  I mean, if I say it, I mean it, I mean, George, you have put a mark on the world.
[37:08.200 --> 37:13.640]  I cannot tell you how many people I hear talk about coast to coasting and the topics you
[37:13.640 --> 37:19.840]  cover, and George Norrie, how many people who have made connections and woken up through
[37:19.840 --> 37:20.840]  what you're doing.
[37:20.840 --> 37:25.680]  It is, for me, I've learned the New World Order, the root of all evil is not the love
[37:25.680 --> 37:26.680]  of money.
[37:26.680 --> 37:29.560]  That's how they sell out ignorant people is for the love of money.
[37:29.560 --> 37:35.800]  The true Illuminati, dark ones, they are into the souls and minds and psyches, and they believe
[37:35.800 --> 37:41.760]  in the psychic power from my research of sucking energy and lying and shuttering minds.
[37:41.760 --> 37:45.640]  But as your book, and as your name means, Worker in the Light, one of your last books,
[37:45.640 --> 37:50.760]  the power of unlocking minds, that's my gold, that's my treasure, that's what I seek, and
[37:50.760 --> 37:56.360]  I think we are on the same wavelength, correct me if I'm wrong, you get a thrill out of speaking
[37:56.360 --> 37:57.960]  truth and unlocking minds.
[37:57.960 --> 38:03.840]  I do, and I just love the fact that we can help people as we do it, and to me it's worth
[38:03.840 --> 38:04.840]  it.
[38:04.840 --> 38:09.840]  You know, Alex, I hate money, I can't stand it, but whatever I do make, I help people
[38:09.840 --> 38:14.800]  that I care about, whether it's family members or friends or a lady who calls the show and
[38:14.800 --> 38:20.080]  can't make her mortgage payment, that's what it's all about, that's what we hear for.
[38:20.080 --> 38:26.720]  And I have learned a long time ago that for every good deed you do, it comes back to you
[38:26.720 --> 38:28.400]  by five or ten.
[38:28.400 --> 38:32.360]  For every bad deed you do, the same thing happens.
[38:32.360 --> 38:33.360]  So you know what?
[38:33.360 --> 38:36.160]  I'd rather help people than get the other side.
[38:36.160 --> 38:41.600]  Well, sure, as a good person, you spiritually are that way anyways, but I learned that too,
[38:41.600 --> 38:44.080]  that's what they say about God fearing.
[38:44.080 --> 38:48.120]  God fearing means universe fearing, I mean, I would be, not that I would like to do it,
[38:48.120 --> 38:50.960]  but I would be scared to do things wrong consciously.
[38:50.960 --> 38:51.960]  Well, absolutely.
[38:51.960 --> 39:00.280]  I mean, it is just unconscionable for me to see other people get hurt by these people,
[39:00.280 --> 39:06.320]  these egomaniacs, these lunatics, these greedy son of a guns who are out there doing what
[39:06.320 --> 39:07.320]  they do.
[39:07.320 --> 39:08.320]  I just don't understand it.
[39:08.320 --> 39:14.440]  I don't understand how the globalists who have more money than will ever, ever need
[39:14.440 --> 39:18.320]  one more, it just defies logic.
[39:18.320 --> 39:22.720]  Incredible, George, I know you always come on when I drag you on here and then never
[39:22.720 --> 39:28.280]  even plug what you're doing, but tell us about the new book, How Folks Get Us, tell us about
[39:28.280 --> 39:33.200]  the website, tell us about the work you're doing, because supporting alternative truthful
[39:33.200 --> 39:38.000]  media, again, is an example to others who are afraid to tell the truth.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.600]  George Norring is an example, my show is an example to others.
[39:41.600 --> 39:46.280]  We hit the barbed wire so others can come along later and tell the truth, so it's very
[39:46.280 --> 39:49.360]  important to spread the word and support the work of George Norring.
[39:49.360 --> 39:55.960]  George, tell us again about coast2coastam.com, your own sites, the books, you know, give
[39:55.960 --> 39:56.960]  folks a plug.
[39:56.960 --> 40:03.160]  Well, very quickly, coast2coastam.com, you've got to put the two in there, coast2coastam.com,
[40:03.160 --> 40:07.960]  that's our main website, you can go up there and become one of our Twitter followers or
[40:07.960 --> 40:12.920]  our Facebook friends where we'll send you information as often as possible.
[40:12.920 --> 40:16.480]  Our latest book that we have out there now is called Talking to the Dead.
[40:16.480 --> 40:21.720]  It's a great book about people's obsession with communicating with the other side.
[40:21.720 --> 40:25.880]  It's in every major bookstore, but if you want a discount and you can wait a week to
[40:25.880 --> 40:30.120]  get it, go to Amazon.com and enjoy yourself and everybody.
[40:30.120 --> 40:35.920]  I hope they all have a wonderful holiday, Alex, you know, we brought, I'll be live on Thanksgiving
[40:35.920 --> 40:40.760]  every night, that's another thing we do, I made a pledge a long time ago to our audience
[40:40.760 --> 40:45.160]  that if a holiday falls on a regular working day, I'm going to work it.
[40:45.160 --> 40:50.400]  I'm not taking the night off and I make sure that we've done it and I haven't missed one
[40:50.400 --> 40:54.120]  holiday that has fallen on a regular work day yet.
[40:54.120 --> 40:58.160]  And I think a lot of people who are lonely out there who don't have families appreciate
[40:58.160 --> 40:59.160]  that.
[40:59.160 --> 41:00.160]  Haven't you even done Christmas?
[41:00.160 --> 41:07.640]  Oh, yeah, there are any Christmas that falls on a work day I will do and this coming Christmas,
[41:07.640 --> 41:13.640]  one of my weekend guys, it's on a Sunday, George Nap will be on, and I made sure that
[41:13.640 --> 41:18.840]  if he was taken off, because I was prepared to come on, there's no way we're going to
[41:18.840 --> 41:21.320]  do a taped program on a holiday.
[41:21.320 --> 41:27.120]  But the following New Year's Day, January 1st, I'll be live, I'll be on coming back
[41:27.120 --> 41:33.520]  from vacation that week, I get three weeks, only take one, I'll be live on January 1st,
[41:33.520 --> 41:39.840]  because again, the pledge is, if we're working a regular day and it happens to be a holiday,
[41:39.840 --> 41:40.840]  it's a live show.
[41:40.840 --> 41:44.760]  Well, that was my question I wanted to ask you, but I mean, right there's the evidence
[41:44.760 --> 41:49.640]  of the passion, I'm the same way I have to make myself take off just to see my family,
[41:49.640 --> 41:55.040]  the passion of the honor, the big obnoxious hillbilly that I am able to talk to people,
[41:55.040 --> 42:00.960]  the honor that will come on your show next Monday night is just incredible.
[42:00.960 --> 42:04.200]  There was some question I said I was going to ask you, but I'd get to it later and now
[42:04.200 --> 42:05.200]  I don't remember what it was.
[42:05.200 --> 42:06.200]  Do you remember, George?
[42:06.200 --> 42:07.200]  Was it about the globalists?
[42:07.200 --> 42:08.200]  Was it about...
[42:08.200 --> 42:09.200]  That was what it was.
[42:09.200 --> 42:10.200]  That's what it was about.
[42:10.200 --> 42:14.240]  Again, I don't get into religious groups, I think everybody's great, whatever, I'm not
[42:14.240 --> 42:18.560]  into bashing groups, so I hate to even mention this, but it is a political statement.
[42:18.560 --> 42:23.120]  What do you make of the Vatican endorsing a global currency, a global bank?
[42:23.120 --> 42:25.240]  I mean, that was just incredible last week.
[42:25.240 --> 42:29.080]  Well, if it's their bank, I think they'll be even happier.
[42:29.080 --> 42:31.600]  I am not a fan of organized religion, Alex.
[42:31.600 --> 42:36.760]  I'm a believer in God and I think everybody deserves to worship and look, I was raised
[42:36.760 --> 42:42.960]  a Catholic and I'm not knocking the religion, but what I'm saying is that there are human
[42:42.960 --> 42:50.200]  beings in every aspect of this planet and they are greedy and egotistical and they do
[42:50.200 --> 42:59.400]  things that are not very good and whether it's in religion or politics, they're out
[42:59.400 --> 43:04.320]  there and the name of the game right now is consolidation.
[43:04.320 --> 43:08.840]  Let's put this planet under one roof and that's what they're all trying to do.
[43:08.840 --> 43:12.160]  Yeah, how do you fight a parking ticket when it's going to somewhere in Europe to the
[43:12.160 --> 43:13.160]  Hague?
[43:13.160 --> 43:17.160]  But again, exactly, it's not about Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, any of this stuff
[43:17.160 --> 43:18.400]  or atheist.
[43:18.400 --> 43:25.200]  The point is, it's Time Magazine, Newsweek, CFR, all these groups are calling for global
[43:25.200 --> 43:28.960]  government and I'm just saying, hey, we told you so.
[43:28.960 --> 43:33.480]  I had a problem with a credit card a few weeks ago, so I called my credit card company and
[43:33.480 --> 43:41.520]  I just wanted to check something out and they routed me somewhere to some other country,
[43:41.520 --> 43:42.520]  somewhere.
[43:42.520 --> 43:48.200]  It's obvious, I've talked to enough people, I know accents and this person is trying to
[43:48.200 --> 43:52.400]  figure out what's wrong and I'm trying to explain to them what's wrong and it was a
[43:52.400 --> 43:53.400]  nightmare.
[43:53.400 --> 44:00.120]  I was on the phone for an hour and I didn't get anything done and I said, you know what,
[44:00.120 --> 44:04.440]  this entire planet is just topsy turvy.
[44:04.440 --> 44:11.560]  I think we need to have autonomy, individual countries, yes, step in and help people.
[44:11.560 --> 44:16.400]  I think we should be helping the people in Mexico who are so oppressed, they have to
[44:16.400 --> 44:22.240]  sneak across the border for fear of getting killed in order to make a few bucks to send
[44:22.240 --> 44:23.360]  back to their families.
[44:23.360 --> 44:29.760]  I think as a country, we need to help these other countries in some form or fashion, but
[44:29.760 --> 44:33.600]  not when the dictators take the billions and eight that we send to them.
[44:33.600 --> 44:38.480]  Well, you're exactly right again and Mexico is just a totally failed state, completely
[44:38.480 --> 44:39.480]  imploding.
[44:39.480 --> 44:43.160]  That is the last question, I'll let you go to get some sleep or get ready for your big
[44:43.160 --> 44:51.040]  show tonight that's midnight central, 10 o'clock Pacific, 1 a.m. Eastern, I guess it's 11 p.m.
[44:51.040 --> 44:53.600]  Mountain, but fast and furious.
[44:53.600 --> 44:57.600]  This is just the tip of the iceberg as we learn more and more about what this government's
[44:57.600 --> 44:58.600]  been doing.
[44:58.600 --> 45:01.040]  Give us 60 seconds on that, George and we'll say Sionara.
[45:01.040 --> 45:03.480]  Well, we know what the government's doing.
[45:03.480 --> 45:10.800]  The plan has always been control, control, control and if the heads of state who are
[45:10.800 --> 45:16.680]  part of the group that gets to be in control still stay in power, then they're going to
[45:16.680 --> 45:17.680]  go for it.
[45:17.680 --> 45:24.200]  It's unfortunately human nature to take care of your own and that's what they're starting
[45:24.200 --> 45:25.200]  to do.
[45:25.200 --> 45:32.440]  They want total control for themselves first and then, you know, we're by the wayside.
[45:32.440 --> 45:37.840]  Well, one of the good things about the Alex Jones show and what we do on coast to coast
[45:37.840 --> 45:45.520]  is we keep batting away and one day, one day, people will stand up and say enough is enough.
[45:45.520 --> 45:51.560]  Not just like the Occupy Wall Street folks or people who truly protest, but it will happen.
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.080]  There's no doubt in my mind that eventually we will win out.
[45:55.080 --> 45:56.080]  Well, exactly.
[45:56.080 --> 45:59.800]  When you were talking about the Federal Reserve 10 years ago, maybe 1% of America knew it
[45:59.800 --> 46:00.800]  was private.
[46:00.800 --> 46:04.400]  Now it's in polls upwards of 80 plus percent know it's private.
[46:04.400 --> 46:05.400]  Yep.
[46:05.400 --> 46:08.960]  We are winning, I think that's why the tyrants are pushing so hard.
[46:08.960 --> 46:16.360]  George Norrie, coast to coast, am.com you'll be on tonight again midnight central, 10 o'clock
[46:16.360 --> 46:20.800]  Pacific and I'll definitely during a break tonight be tuning in.
[46:20.800 --> 46:22.480]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, George.
[46:22.480 --> 46:23.480]  Thanks Alex.
[46:23.480 --> 46:25.640]  I look forward to interviewing you on Monday night.
[46:25.640 --> 46:26.640]  Absolutely.
[46:26.640 --> 46:27.640]  I'm honored.
[46:27.640 --> 46:28.640]  God bless.
[46:28.640 --> 46:29.640]  All right.
[46:29.640 --> 46:30.640]  Wow.
[46:30.640 --> 46:31.640]  There goes George Norrie.
[46:31.640 --> 46:32.640]  Really hard to get him on radio and he comes on with us.
[46:32.640 --> 46:37.280]  It was so honored to know him and to talk to him out of everybody that's helped us at
[46:37.280 --> 46:38.280]  info wars.
[46:38.280 --> 46:39.280]  Get the word out.
[46:39.280 --> 46:41.920]  You, the listeners, everybody.
[46:41.920 --> 46:45.640]  That's the guy who you've got to say has really, I mean, we would be on the map right
[46:45.640 --> 46:46.640]  now.
[46:46.640 --> 46:51.320]  We'd be having close to the same effect, but George Norrie just turbo charged it.
[46:51.320 --> 46:56.080]  And I mean, the guy is very confident, very smart, very nice, really into justice.
[46:56.080 --> 47:00.600]  And I know him personally hung out with him some and he's just a really great guy.
[47:00.600 --> 47:05.080]  I mean, most talk show hosts don't have other talk show hosts on and he just has really
[47:05.080 --> 47:08.360]  helped pioneer this show and to get it out there.
[47:08.360 --> 47:13.240]  And we really owe George Norrie a huge, huge thanks for the info war to help expose the
[47:13.240 --> 47:18.880]  globalist, not just promoting my show and my material and my information.
[47:18.880 --> 47:22.520]  But more importantly, all the other guests he has on and the issues, you can say, well,
[47:22.520 --> 47:25.520]  he covers these things we can't prove or whatever.
[47:25.520 --> 47:27.800]  He took the show in a whole new direction.
[47:27.800 --> 47:33.080]  You know, he, you know, before it was pure UFOs, ghosting goblins, which is all interesting,
[47:33.080 --> 47:34.080]  entertaining.
[47:34.080 --> 47:36.400]  The point is he didn't swing in 180 degrees.
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.720]  He just took it about 90 degrees where it was all these others, you know, issues that
[47:40.720 --> 47:43.880]  are that nobody ever covered at a level like that.
[47:43.880 --> 47:44.880]  So we salute him.
[47:44.880 --> 47:45.880]  We're going to go to break.
[47:45.880 --> 47:50.680]  We've got a bunch of guests coming up, including the one, the only David, I can others than
[47:50.680 --> 47:51.680]  Mike Adams.
[47:51.680 --> 47:54.560]  I'm going to take a quick little break and play part of a little news piece we did on
[47:54.560 --> 47:56.440]  the bankers and all their arrogant statements.
[47:56.440 --> 48:00.880]  We're going to come back, get to some calls and then David IQs in New Zealand, we're working
[48:00.880 --> 48:02.360]  on time zones on that front.
[48:02.360 --> 48:05.520]  Oh, by the way, I haven't plugged this in 48 minutes.
[48:05.520 --> 48:06.520]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[48:06.520 --> 48:08.520]  That's why we're here for 27 hours.
[48:08.520 --> 48:11.760]  If you want to donate, we can hire more crew because it's killing us.
[48:11.760 --> 48:13.600]  I mean, I'm only going to do a money bomb.
[48:13.600 --> 48:18.080]  I realize I needed the money again because you got five guys doing the nightly news, including
[48:18.080 --> 48:20.280]  myself, four people and then myself.
[48:20.280 --> 48:25.680]  And then there's, we got one reporter, one video editor, one switcher guy, you know,
[48:25.680 --> 48:26.680]  he's multitasking.
[48:26.680 --> 48:27.680]  It's hard.
[48:27.680 --> 48:28.680]  Five nights a week.
[48:28.680 --> 48:32.040]  We need to get a couple more people so that we can get even more done and have somebody
[48:32.040 --> 48:35.160]  when somebody's got flu, like one guy's got to go to a funeral Monday.
[48:35.160 --> 48:36.160]  One person already had vacation.
[48:36.160 --> 48:39.520]  It's going to be three of us doing the whole deal Monday and we're going to be here.
[48:39.520 --> 48:43.000]  We're going to be live seven o'clock, but then we've been working on the technology
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.400]  to stream it outright and everything.
[48:44.400 --> 48:48.920]  I mean, it's crazy and I'm not complaining, but we need your support to get more equipment,
[48:48.920 --> 48:52.160]  hire more people and do it comfortably and not have to worry about cutting other stuff
[48:52.160 --> 48:53.160]  to be able to do it.
[48:53.160 --> 48:56.800]  If you're a nonated infowarsmoneybomb.com or if that site's slow because of all the traffic
[48:56.800 --> 49:01.000]  infowars.com and spread the word about this 27 hour broadcast that we're now, I don't
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.320]  know, what are we almost 20 hours into this bad boy?
[49:04.320 --> 49:08.640]  And we got 21 hours.
[49:08.640 --> 49:14.960]  And so let me see 11 o'clock to five, five, six, so we're 21 hours basically, 21 hours
[49:14.960 --> 49:16.640]  is left ahead of us.
[49:16.640 --> 49:22.280]  We're six hours into this right now, a little less than six hours into it.
[49:22.280 --> 49:26.200]  And we're going 20, 27 so, so, so please spread the word.
[49:26.200 --> 49:27.840]  We got 21 hours left.
[49:27.840 --> 49:32.640]  We've got a rundown of who's coming up next at infowars.com, the free video streams, everything,
[49:32.640 --> 49:37.600]  prisonplanet.tv, infowarsmoneybomb.com, infowars, it's going to be crazy.
[49:37.600 --> 49:42.560]  And I, the potbellied pumpkin headed redneck who loves Liberty and hates tyranny will be
[49:42.560 --> 49:43.640]  here with you.
[49:43.640 --> 49:44.640]  Great job.
[49:44.640 --> 49:47.640]  The crew will be back after this piece on the banksters from the nightly news a few
[49:47.640 --> 49:48.640]  weeks ago.
[49:48.640 --> 49:52.240]  And then we're going to go to the next information, callers and others, infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[49:52.240 --> 49:53.240]  Be part of it.
[49:53.240 --> 49:54.240]  Stay with us.
[49:54.240 --> 49:58.040]  What is the proper relationship?
[49:58.040 --> 50:02.120]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the
[50:02.120 --> 50:03.120]  United States?
[50:03.120 --> 50:09.240]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically
[50:09.240 --> 50:19.600]  that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[50:19.600 --> 50:27.240]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress
[50:27.240 --> 50:32.760]  or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate
[50:32.760 --> 50:38.240]  thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[50:38.240 --> 50:41.600]  And I've had very good relationships with the president.
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.520]  Are U.S. Treasury bonds still safe to invest in?
[50:46.520 --> 50:47.520]  Very much so.
[50:47.520 --> 50:53.200]  I think there's a, this is not an issue of credit rating.
[50:53.200 --> 50:59.920]  The United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that.
[50:59.920 --> 51:04.480]  So there is zero probability of default.
[51:04.480 --> 51:08.960]  The reason the Federal Reserve was founded a century ago was to try to address the problems
[51:08.960 --> 51:13.320]  arising from financial panics which did by the way occur in an unregulated environment
[51:13.320 --> 51:15.760]  in the 19th century.
[51:15.760 --> 51:19.720]  We provided liquidity and short-term loans to help financial systems stabilize.
[51:19.720 --> 51:22.480]  We did that not because we particularly care about the managers.
[51:22.480 --> 51:25.720]  You say it's not spending money, well, it's money out of thin air.
[51:25.720 --> 51:29.640]  You put it into the market, you hold assets and the assets aren't, you know, they are
[51:29.640 --> 51:33.320]  diminishing in value when you, when you wake up in the morning, do you care about the price
[51:33.320 --> 51:34.320]  of gold?
[51:34.320 --> 51:37.960]  Well, I pay attention to the price of gold, but I think it reflects a lot of things.
[51:37.960 --> 51:40.120]  It reflects global uncertainties.
[51:40.120 --> 51:43.800]  I think people are, the reason people hold gold is there's a protection against what
[51:43.800 --> 51:46.560]  we call tail risk, really, really bad outcomes.
[51:46.560 --> 51:50.120]  And to the extent that the last few years have made people more worried about the potential
[51:50.120 --> 51:52.960]  of a major crisis than they have gold as a protection.
[51:52.960 --> 51:55.960]  Do you think gold is money?
[51:55.960 --> 51:56.960]  No.
[51:56.960 --> 52:03.080]  It's not money, it's even if it has been money for 6,000 years, somebody reversed
[52:03.080 --> 52:06.120]  that and eliminated that economic law.
[52:06.120 --> 52:09.080]  Well, it's, you know, it's an asset.
[52:09.080 --> 52:11.240]  I mean, it's the same, would you say Treasury bills are money?
[52:11.240 --> 52:13.240]  I don't think they're money either, but they're a financial asset.
[52:13.240 --> 52:14.240]  Central banks hold it.
[52:14.240 --> 52:15.240]  Well, it's the former reserves.
[52:15.240 --> 52:16.240]  Why don't they hold diamonds?
[52:16.240 --> 52:17.240]  Well, it's tradition.
[52:17.240 --> 52:18.240]  Long-term tradition.
[52:18.240 --> 52:30.840]  So my question to you is, will you tell the American people to whom you lent 2.2 trillion
[52:30.840 --> 52:32.800]  of their dollars?
[52:32.800 --> 52:36.920]  Will you tell us who got that money and what the terms are of those agreements?
[52:36.920 --> 52:39.640]  We explain each of our programs in terms of the terms.
[52:39.640 --> 52:41.000]  We explain the terms exactly.
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.840]  We explain what the collateral requirements are.
[52:42.840 --> 52:43.840]  We explain what the terms are.
[52:43.840 --> 52:44.840]  To whom did you explain that?
[52:44.840 --> 52:45.840]  It's on our website.
[52:45.840 --> 52:46.840]  Yeah.
[52:46.840 --> 52:47.840]  Okay.
[52:47.840 --> 52:49.720]  So all that information is available in our commercial paper program.
[52:49.720 --> 52:51.520]  And who got the money?
[52:51.520 --> 52:56.840]  Hundreds and hundreds of banks, any bank that has access to the U.S. Federal Reserve's
[52:56.840 --> 52:57.840]  discounts.
[52:57.840 --> 52:58.840]  We tell us who they are?
[52:58.840 --> 52:59.840]  No.
[52:59.840 --> 53:03.840]  Because the reason that is counterproductive and will destroy the value of the program
[53:03.840 --> 53:05.520]  is that banks will not come to the business.
[53:05.520 --> 53:06.760]  Isn't that too bad?
[53:06.760 --> 53:08.400]  I left Goldman Sachs.
[53:08.400 --> 53:10.560]  I sold my shares in Goldman Sachs.
[53:10.560 --> 53:11.560]  I deferred, too.
[53:11.560 --> 53:14.880]  You didn't have to pay any tax on your 200 million dollars.
[53:14.880 --> 53:17.080]  I sold my shares in Goldman Sachs.
[53:17.080 --> 53:21.880]  The clause is that if you come into the administration and you sell your assets, it's tax deferred.
[53:21.880 --> 53:25.560]  You don't have to pay 200 million dollar profit and you didn't have to pay any tax.
[53:25.560 --> 53:26.560]  Isn't that true?
[53:26.560 --> 53:27.560]  Listen, is that true or not?
[53:27.560 --> 53:28.560]  Yes or no?
[53:28.560 --> 53:29.560]  It is.
[53:29.560 --> 53:33.560]  You do not pay a profit when someone, a tax when someone makes you sell assets.
[53:33.560 --> 53:36.040]  Maybe that was the incentive for you to become Secretary of Treasury so you didn't have to
[53:36.040 --> 53:39.680]  pay the tax there.
[53:39.680 --> 53:49.000]  This thing I would say to you and say it very, very clearly is I, you know, I behaved with
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  the...
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.400]  You don't think you should have recrused yourself when you asked Lehman to go into bankruptcy.
[53:54.400 --> 53:59.480]  You didn't put Bear Stearns in bankruptcy and then you folded Merrill Lynch into...
[53:59.480 --> 54:03.200]  I mean, isn't there some point where you've got to say, hey, I've got a conflict of interest
[54:03.200 --> 54:04.200]  here?
[54:04.200 --> 54:08.400]  Do you don't feel any kind of scintilla of ethics on this thing at all?
[54:08.400 --> 54:10.720]  No, totally.
[54:10.720 --> 54:17.040]  I operated very consistently with the, in the ethic guidelines I had as Secretary of
[54:17.040 --> 54:29.680]  the Treasury and when it became, when it became clear that we had some very significant issues
[54:29.680 --> 54:32.280]  with Goldman Sachs and with...
[54:32.280 --> 54:33.280]  Why didn't you recruse yourself then?
[54:33.280 --> 54:37.800]  With Morgan Stanley, what I did then, it would have been very wrong for me to recuse
[54:37.800 --> 54:43.040]  myself when I did was I went and got a waiver from the ethics agreement because when we
[54:43.040 --> 54:44.040]  had concerns...
[54:44.040 --> 54:45.520]  Who was in charge of the ethics agreement?
[54:45.520 --> 54:46.520]  What?
[54:46.520 --> 54:48.480]  Who's in charge of the ethics agreement since you got a waiver?
[54:48.480 --> 54:55.040]  We have, we have a office of ethics and treasury and we have a White House ethics office.
[54:55.040 --> 55:10.360]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind, there was something so pleasant
[55:10.360 --> 55:16.360]  about that place, even your emotions haven't echoed in so much space.
[55:16.360 --> 55:17.360]  Okay, Mike Adams is coming up.
[55:17.360 --> 55:20.360]  David Hike is over at New Zealand and he, he always ends up popping in.
[55:20.360 --> 55:25.000]  We're working out some, some different feats here in case David does call in.
[55:25.000 --> 55:31.720]  Clearly, we're on time, we're a little bit late with Mike Adams, we'll just let him
[55:31.720 --> 55:33.880]  interview Mike Adams, that should be interesting.
[55:33.880 --> 55:37.880]  Or Michael, go to break, I'll come back and interview, I can then put Adams back on because
[55:37.880 --> 55:43.320]  Adams is here to host for a couple of hours while I go over there and, and watercolor
[55:43.320 --> 55:51.040]  and pen and ink and acrylic paint stuff for the auctions that we're doing that are linked
[55:51.040 --> 55:56.280]  up at infowarsmoneybomb.com to fund this operation to buy the new equipment and get some more
[55:56.280 --> 55:57.880]  crew we need hired.
[55:57.880 --> 56:01.960]  And my goal is to get enough subscriptions the next year to be able to syndicate this
[56:01.960 --> 56:05.160]  thing on TV and not have to do a Moneybomb next year.
[56:05.160 --> 56:06.840]  That is my goal.
[56:06.840 --> 56:10.720]  But I was looking at the numbers and then this Moneybomb is needed, so we're doing it,
[56:10.720 --> 56:11.720]  infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[56:11.720 --> 56:16.120]  If you want to donate, I also want to thank the great folks over at Cabo Bobs here in
[56:16.120 --> 56:21.280]  Austin, Texas, their listeners, and the owner over there is a fan of the show.
[56:21.280 --> 56:27.400]  We want to thank them for the great Mexican food, Don over there, for the great Mexican
[56:27.400 --> 56:29.120]  food that they provided to the crew.
[56:29.120 --> 56:33.840]  I'm going to try not to tank up on too much of it though, because I got to go paint.
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.560]  I was supposed to do this days ago, and I just got so busy with the nightly news, everything
[56:37.560 --> 56:38.560]  else I never did it.
[56:38.560 --> 56:42.360]  So, and we're going to videotape me doing this, but I don't know what we're going to
[56:42.360 --> 56:43.360]  do now.
[56:43.360 --> 56:47.640]  It's been more and more insane by the minute, but I want to talk to Lance, Julio, Tina, and
[56:47.640 --> 56:52.000]  Zach who've been holding, and then if Mike wants to open the phones up, I know he's got
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.720]  some guests coming on with some big breaking news.
[56:53.720 --> 56:57.040]  I'm sure he'll take some calls as well, and there'll be some big segments tonight where
[56:57.040 --> 57:02.000]  I do want to take your calls and get calls on with the guest, and plus I've got to get
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.000]  people an update.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.120]  We're going to have Mike do some updates on the amount of donations that have come in
[57:06.120 --> 57:08.120]  at infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[57:08.120 --> 57:15.680]  But the issue is we've got 21 hours and two minutes left in this extravaganza in the fight
[57:15.680 --> 57:21.000]  against tyranny, and we've got a premiering here, premiering here.
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.600]  He's done six months of research on everything she said, adding all these documents and video
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.960]  clips, and I said, stop Aaron, it's got to air today.
[57:29.960 --> 57:34.000]  Never before seen or known stuff on Skull and Bones from Charlotte Isherby who had family
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.120]  with Skull and Bones, her dad and others.
[57:36.120 --> 57:37.960]  That's going to premiere tonight.
[57:37.960 --> 57:41.680]  We've got stuff that's going to premiere with Nick Badgich.
[57:41.680 --> 57:43.080]  It's just insane.
[57:43.080 --> 57:44.360]  And I've got some other surprises.
[57:44.360 --> 57:46.920]  Jarron wants to have a chair race around the office.
[57:46.920 --> 57:52.100]  I think, well, iPhone video, it'll be next to live somewhere in the middle hours, still
[57:52.100 --> 57:54.840]  hours of the night, and then put that up, some fun stuff.
[57:54.840 --> 57:59.640]  I didn't even ask Weldon Henson like last year, but I am undoubtedly not going to sing
[57:59.640 --> 58:03.360]  this year like a demonic Tomcat.
[58:03.360 --> 58:06.040]  I'm going to have Weldon Henson, a great singer coming here and singing.
[58:06.040 --> 58:07.920]  In fact, you heard it, Weldon.
[58:07.920 --> 58:08.920]  He won't be here.
[58:08.920 --> 58:09.920]  He's going to play tonight.
[58:09.920 --> 58:12.720]  We'll make him come after the gig.
[58:12.720 --> 58:15.160]  Yeah, call his butt.
[58:15.160 --> 58:16.160]  I noticed he was all dressed up.
[58:16.160 --> 58:18.440]  So I just had the idea to have Weldon in here.
[58:18.440 --> 58:19.440]  Now he's going to do it.
[58:19.440 --> 58:20.440]  Where is he playing tonight?
[58:20.440 --> 58:21.440]  You want to do a drum solo?
[58:21.440 --> 58:24.240]  I'll play the drums on top of my head.
[58:24.240 --> 58:25.800]  Just like, all right.
[58:25.800 --> 58:29.160]  By the way, got to do on the drums in like Fall the Republic.
[58:29.160 --> 58:31.280]  That sounds so awesome in that intro.
[58:31.280 --> 58:33.680]  Just slaying on the drums.
[58:33.680 --> 58:37.160]  Chris in there.
[58:37.160 --> 58:39.520]  Chris also known as Minion of Jaron.
[58:39.520 --> 58:43.400]  Anyways, I'm just joking.
[58:43.400 --> 58:44.400]  I'm a Minion.
[58:44.400 --> 58:49.000]  If you guys have trained me well, they're all Vatican assassins in there, folks.
[58:49.000 --> 58:50.000]  Okay.
[58:50.000 --> 58:51.000]  Enough humor.
[58:51.000 --> 58:54.000]  Let's go to Lance in Texas and Julio, Tina and Zach, and then we'll bring Mike Adams
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  in here.
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  Go ahead, Lance.
[58:56.000 --> 59:00.920]  Well, if you're this delirious at five o'clock in afternoon, I can't wait till tonight, but
[59:00.920 --> 59:06.320]  I want to quickly tell you about walking through the, going to the airport San Francisco along
[59:06.320 --> 59:07.320]  with DFW.
[59:07.320 --> 59:09.440]  Your slave rape training.
[59:09.440 --> 59:10.920]  Tell us about it, Lance.
[59:10.920 --> 59:11.920]  Yes.
[59:11.920 --> 59:16.600]  Well, I was the only one out of my family wearing the 9-11 was inside job shirt.
[59:16.600 --> 59:18.160]  My brother got body scan.
[59:18.160 --> 59:25.120]  My parents refused it and they both got the pat down and they were trying to make light
[59:25.120 --> 59:26.120]  of it.
[59:26.120 --> 59:27.120]  You know, oh, this is in a big deal.
[59:27.120 --> 59:32.040]  Well, they told my mom she had explosives on her and she's like, what this ridiculous?
[59:32.040 --> 59:33.600]  It's all about how you're guilty.
[59:33.600 --> 59:39.640]  Never checking them though, have these, all this predisposed behavior towards criminality.
[59:39.640 --> 59:44.760]  Pretty soon it's like their proctology exam, soon it'll be cutting your head off.
[59:44.760 --> 59:46.400]  This is no big deal.
[59:46.400 --> 59:47.960]  It's all about getting into your body.
[59:47.960 --> 59:48.960]  Go ahead.
[59:48.960 --> 59:49.960]  Yes.
[59:49.960 --> 59:52.960]  Thank you for doing the, I'm all going to order the 100 bumper stickers.
[59:52.960 --> 59:57.280]  I think that's a great idea because we need to get them out there.
[59:57.280 --> 1:00:00.720]  But whatever you do, sir, don't plaster them up everywhere.
[1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:05.840]  I mean, look, look, look, look, we're not in trouble with light poles, with cameras and
[1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:07.440]  microphones listening to us.
[1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:12.080]  This is not the time to even engage in Mao political action with bumper stickers.
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:13.880]  This is the time to go along with it.
[1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:20.280]  It's not the time to climb, climb billboards everywhere and spraypaininfowars.com on it.
[1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:22.720]  Don't you dare do it.
[1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:25.840]  Hand in your firearms, give your money to JP Morgan immediately.
[1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:26.840]  No, no way.
[1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:27.840]  No way.
[1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:28.840]  Hey, I will.
[1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:31.960]  I will, I wanted to say two other things.
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:37.760]  YouTube censorship, I think what they're doing now, I can't even get your uploads, like when
[1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:42.080]  you upload new videos, like I'm blog from receiving those.
[1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:46.040]  So, you know, they may not be censoring them other ways, but that's a way that they could
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:47.040]  do it that way.
[1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:48.040]  You know what I'm saying?
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:52.920]  Well, how about we check to the TSA workers aren't terrorists and then they get proctology
[1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:54.440]  exams by like a robot.
[1:00:54.440 --> 1:00:55.440]  Right.
[1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:56.440]  Right.
[1:00:56.440 --> 1:00:57.440]  I mean, that's what I said to the TSA.
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:00:59.040]  Now, I know you're not a terrorist.
[1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:01.960]  Alex, Alex, real quick, real quick, real quick.
[1:01:01.960 --> 1:01:07.600]  I will double my donation if I can get you to do Marvin the Martian saying, I like Red
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:08.600]  Man.
[1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:16.160]  Oh dear, I've lost my Red Man chewing tobacco, I'll have to disintegrate that pesky earth
[1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:17.160]  creature.
[1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:21.040]  He has Levi Garrett and Red Man too.
[1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:27.400]  Oh dear, carcinogenic chewing tobacco, there's nothing I love her about.
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:28.400]  I love her.
[1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:29.400]  That's great.
[1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:30.400]  All right.
[1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:34.320]  Your donation has gone from one penny to two pennies.
[1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:35.320]  $50.
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:41.520]  Hey, you're awesome, sweetheart, it's all, God bless your lands, holy, oh, in Illinois,
[1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:43.520]  come on down.
[1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:49.520]  Alejandro, hold on, I got to take a sip of some fluoride water if that's okay.
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:51.920]  Because the government, it's no big deal.
[1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:55.800]  Everybody drinks fluoride and has some pot belly pedophile grab their genitals and their
[1:01:55.800 --> 1:02:01.000]  wife's breast, it happens to everybody in America, America always had microphones in
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.520]  the street lights.
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:08.000]  It's all part of the freedom, Americans always ate GMO crops spliced with other insects and
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.040]  animals and pesticides.
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:15.120]  It's here not normal if you don't like it, don't question it early, I'll come now.
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:20.680]  I love fluoride water, they won't drink the water.
[1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:24.760]  I went to college, I want to give a shout out to my friend Tim, who's a big fan of yours,
[1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:30.520]  Alex, we went to college at the police state university known as Western Illinois University
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:34.880]  where we had a fluoridic acid in our drinking water, which is even better than sodium water.
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:38.720]  But imagine the psychopaths know that that eats your brain and sevenfold increase in
[1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:42.120]  cancer and it's such a sick joke and then of course it's all the other poisons, whether
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:47.440]  it's uranium, you name it, just ha ha ha ha, try to kill that, ah.
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:52.320]  Every time they lower a kid into a gray, they're just like, oh, God, the satanic power is incredible,
[1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:54.280]  ah, yes.
[1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:59.040]  And again, we're not supposed to get upset by that, everything is fine, Janet Napolitano
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:00.520]  cares about us.
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:07.040]  Yes, Mr. Napolitano cares about myself and my family and yours as well, Alex, they're
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:08.040]  just playing.
[1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:13.720]  But as much as we don't like her, look at what a literal bloated bag of maggot vomit
[1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:14.720]  she is.
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:16.640]  Can you imagine being that reeking?
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:20.840]  I guarantee you, you get anywhere near that woman, I bet if she raised her arm, it smells
[1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:22.200]  like a thousand dead bodies.
[1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:26.640]  If you got anywhere near her, it would probably just the vomit would come out of you.
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:30.680]  She's got an eddy monster like, you know, white hair and everything, I mean, can you
[1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:32.240]  imagine her?
[1:03:32.240 --> 1:03:36.600]  Can you imagine the stench of this giant maggot worm?
[1:03:36.600 --> 1:03:41.400]  You can tell she has no soul, Alex, that's why she's Homeland Security Secretary because
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:47.400]  she's so compromised with all their filth that she's done, you know, she's perfect
[1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:48.400]  to have.
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:52.280]  She's 250 gallons of toilet bowl scum.
[1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:55.760]  Alex, a couple comments and then I want to wish you the best of luck.
[1:03:55.760 --> 1:04:00.720]  Number one, Saturday night, I'm getting set to go to a friend's house to watch my favorite
[1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:03.360]  band, Unfreeze McGee, online.
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:09.240]  And I see out of the corner of my eye while driving, I almost, when I called in, I called
[1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:14.360]  last year about the army trucks, I almost got into an accident watching them, I almost
[1:04:14.360 --> 1:04:20.960]  got into an accident, I see towards my, towards my right, I see our beloved Homeland Security,
[1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:24.360]  Homeland Security truck, TSA truck driving.
[1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:28.800]  Oh yeah, around here, they've got the buses with her on the side staring at you, saying
[1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:33.080]  don't trust anyone but me, basically, I'm serious, people won't believe it, type in
[1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:37.920]  Homeland Security ads on buses, I swear I've seen them in Austin and it's literally her,
[1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:41.880]  it's all about, I'm in your life, whether you like it or not, I'm telling you, trust
[1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:45.440]  no one but me, the fish woman, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:50.480]  Yeah, this was a legitimate Homeland Security truck, I was following it, I was trying to
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:53.280]  do a video, I was, you know, late at, you know, not late at night, I was about like
[1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:56.440]  eight o'clock at night, so it's pitch dark.
[1:04:56.440 --> 1:05:04.080]  And yeah, so like you said, coming up on 11-9-11, so fitting for FEMA to do their media takeover,
[1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:08.280]  I have a feeling when you talked about the TSA checkpoints, they'll probably do one in
[1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:09.280]  suburban Chicago.
[1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:13.800]  If they do that, I'm going to have to film it, because-
[1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:16.960]  Oh no, because they bring that to the mob that runs that, they're like, yeah, when
[1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:20.400]  we rob banks, everybody's got to get down on the floor, you want to train these slaves
[1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:21.400]  even more?
[1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:22.400]  Crush them!
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:28.440]  And they sit back and, you like a chicken leg and throw it, bring me more slaves, I mean,
[1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:33.040]  it's all just the attitude of, look at these scum Americans, we'll get their guns, we'll
[1:05:33.040 --> 1:05:38.960]  shut down their churches, we'll feed them poison, right boss, nothing can stop us, yeah, look
[1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:43.840]  at the creature we got, Napolitano, she does whatever we tell them, and they do it too,
[1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:48.320]  whoever thought Americans was so dumb and put up with it all, it never ends.
[1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:54.080]  I'm sorry, Lillio, I'm going to Chicago slash New York imitation, I can do a boss hog too,
[1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:55.080]  I'm bashing Northerners.
[1:05:55.080 --> 1:06:01.640]  I tell you what, boy, there's nothing these slaves won't put up with, ain't that right,
[1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:06.880]  Paul, you're going to show them, you're going to learn them, we're going to have pot-bellied
[1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:14.880]  pedophiles, rope their women and children at TSA for a terror attack, we did, boss!
[1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:17.880]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:23.240]  You talked about the evilness of Rick Perry, I mentioned I was going to go last week to
[1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:28.440]  see him up in Des Moines, I went with my pal Tim, and you're right, we're obviously going
[1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:33.480]  to ask him a question about Bilderberg, you know, she had to play nice, brought up Texas
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:38.760]  A&M football to, you know, weasel my way, make us flick Rick feel comfortable.
[1:06:38.760 --> 1:06:44.920]  Let's tell you what, Alex, I felt very uncomfortable next to Rick Perry, I mean, the evilness.
[1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:49.760]  No, no, no, folks, I don't tell people things unless, I mean, it really happened, that's
[1:06:49.760 --> 1:06:53.320]  why I admitted that I was wanting to get on the flight, was tired, and was just sick of
[1:06:53.320 --> 1:06:56.480]  it and rationalized, well, I'll be able to report on what happens, go ahead and wrote
[1:06:56.480 --> 1:06:59.800]  me, people are like, well, how dare you, don't stand up, I was just honest about it, I mean,
[1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:05.200]  I'm honest about what happens, and Rick Perry, literally, I've been around him a couple times,
[1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:09.400]  he actually sends like a shutter up, you like he's a vampire, I mean, he really creeps
[1:07:09.400 --> 1:07:13.160]  you out when you're in person with him, I mean, he came over to my table once to leer
[1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:18.960]  at me like, he was like a vampire or something, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:24.320]  No, no, yeah, I mean, I felt that, I mean, I looked at his face, and he was like a wrinkly
[1:07:24.320 --> 1:07:29.120]  looking, no, no, he looks like a zombie, he looks like a vampire, who's the guy that played
[1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:35.120]  the vampire in the 70s and 80s movies, Christopher Lee, he played Sauriman, and I mean, it's
[1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:37.600]  like Sauriman, I'm telling you.
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:41.800]  And then quickly, I was going to confront Newt Gingrich on Bohemia and Grove, it was
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:47.560]  a faith and freedom conference, it was like a Christian event, so definitely, they were
[1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:52.720]  pimping out the evangelical vote, which made me want to vomit being a Christian, but I
[1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:57.960]  saw Newt Gingrich, I was very close to asking him about number one, you know, the Christian
[1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:01.400]  conservative values, and then get him on Bohemia and Grove.
[1:08:01.400 --> 1:08:05.720]  This is a guy who divorced his wife while she was dying of cancer, and told her, hey,
[1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:10.960]  I got a new wife, and then divorced her, but that's a side issue, people get divorced.
[1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:16.520]  The thing is, he's for carbon taxes, he wrote the forward to the Toffler book, calling for
[1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:20.640]  world government, he is a sack of crap.
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:21.640]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:27.480]  Oh yeah, he really, he looks like a sad, depressed man, I mean, I looked at his eyes and he just,
[1:08:27.480 --> 1:08:32.960]  he looked awful, all these politicians, except for Ron Paul, I mean, you can tell once you're
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:38.680]  waking, if you see him in person and you look into their eyes, you can tell they're just,
[1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:39.680]  you know, just sad.
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:44.240]  Ron Paul is the opposite, he's a machine, what is he, 76 now?
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:51.640]  I mean, Ron Paul is a machine, and he is old, but he's stronger than them, he's stronger
[1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:52.640]  than these people.
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:58.120]  You had, you showed that Darren McBreen piece on propaganda and stuff like that in the media
[1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:03.680]  manipulation, studying broadcasting at school, having you, you know, wake me up along with
[1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:09.800]  others, it's so easy to pick up media spin these days, and so easy to see how it's going
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:10.800]  to go.
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:13.960]  Here's an example, here's an example, they had an article off KXN, yesh dad, and get
[1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:19.480]  to about the first body scanner going in Austin Berkstrom, right down the road from him, and
[1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:24.760]  it said Abdul Mohammed, in fact, go see if, well, dude's already left for the day, he's
[1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:29.480]  going on vacation, but they gave me that article last night, it was a KXN, first body scanners
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:36.800]  go in, and it's like Abdul Mohammed is the first to go through it, they picked a Muslim
[1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:41.320]  to interview, so people reading that article and seeing the TV show, there's a newscast
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:47.520]  thing, oh, it's for the Muslims, of course, they use that stereotype to shell it to the
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:52.760]  public, I mean, and again, you read that, and it's like these reporters think it's cute
[1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:58.400]  to be deceptive, they're told, you want to move up here at this operation, you need to
[1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:02.840]  learn how to deceive people, and so, but it was more like, go ahead and do a positive
[1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:07.520]  piece on this, and then they creatively figure out how to be positive for the naked body
[1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:11.480]  scanners for Michael Chertoff, and then they go out of all the people flying and pick a
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:17.640]  Muslim guy named Mohammed, so they can, they probably interviewed 50 people, so they could
[1:10:17.640 --> 1:10:22.600]  say, see a Muslim is going through the scanner, and he doesn't mind it, it's just pure crap,
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:26.720]  I appreciate your call, Julio, Tina in Florida, Zach, and then we're going to go to break
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:32.280]  and come back with Mike Adams in the catbird seat, in the crow's nest, in the cockpit,
[1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:38.600]  in the command seat, in the center of the Info War, let's go to Tina in Florida, welcome.
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:47.600]  Hi Alex, thank you, and hi Mike too, do you know that they're using eugenics on our animals,
[1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:49.600]  cats, and dogs too?
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:53.880]  Oh no, they put chips in them to train us, I know they make them give them vaccines every
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:59.240]  year and it kills them, until the point where the, so many dogs were dying, the vets have
[1:10:59.240 --> 1:11:03.440]  now said only vaccinated dogs twice in its life, but no, tell me, tell me about the eugenics
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:04.440]  with the animals.
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:11.160]  Well, they also have the cancer vaccines in the, you know, medicines that they give the
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:20.720]  dogs, love shots, horrible side effects, itching, allergies, and seizures, so I just wanted
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:24.680]  to let you know that they're doing that to animals too.
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:28.440]  Oh yeah, well I knew they were doing that, I mean that's all part of the eugenics, but
[1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:32.200]  look at dogs, they're all quote bread, that's what it's all about, what do you think of
[1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:35.280]  the 27 hour transmission we're in the middle of right now?
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:41.200]  I think that's great, Alex, and thank you George, that was an awesome talk that you
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:46.560]  had with him, and I think more and more people are awakening up, and I think when you think
[1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:52.240]  about something, the other person also thinks about the same thing, you know, as far as
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:58.880]  awakening and your thoughts on getting everybody together and just letting everybody know
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:00.680]  what's really going on with the government.
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:01.680]  Well you're right.
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:04.480]  And the vaccines too, those are really, really important.
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:09.200]  No, I mean Tina, if we can just get people to not read the information sheet they hand
[1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:13.000]  out when they're pushing the flu shot or whatever, that's a BS thing put out by Big
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:17.720]  Pharma or the pharmacy, and we get them to actually read the insert that comes in the
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:27.920]  box, our problems are over, I mean brain cancer, tumors, death, epilepsy, I mean the list goes
[1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:35.000]  on and on, Parkinson's, narcolepsy, that admission, Guillain-Barre, I mean read the stinking
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:39.920]  insert, that's the thing, they're killing us but no one can believe they're actually
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:41.680]  doing it, that's what's so crazy.
[1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:48.160]  Right, right, and my mom, she thinks that we're going overboard on everything that
[1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:52.240]  we talk about.
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:57.840]  Well God bless your mother, again, I was talking to a former famous, well-known prosecutor
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:03.480]  what was it in Miami, I was talking to a Lionel TV host and Incinicator Radio host out of
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:08.600]  New York, and he was a prosecutor and he pointed out he would always run into it with the defense
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:12.800]  because the defense will use whatever they know is human psychology and works, and I
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:18.080]  appreciate your call Tina, and they would say, but why would this woman drown her baby?
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:21.120]  Well why would he bury the children in this backyard?
[1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:22.120]  But why?
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:25.960]  They always try to make it about why, it doesn't matter why.
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:30.400]  We have the proof they're doing it, but the globalists write books telling us why they're
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:34.880]  doing this, they think they're too many of us and they're playing God, well I say they
[1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:43.280]  go first and then I'll take them serious, you see, and we've actually documented why,
[1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:47.000]  but still when you're talking to somebody who's not a murderer, who's not a control
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:56.120]  freak, somebody like me, I never get tired of tasty food, fishing, laying out in the
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:14:02.640]  sun, lifting weights, hanging out with my family, working, I never get tired of just
[1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:03.640]  simple pleasures.
[1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:09.280]  I mean I could never get tired of, I don't even do it anymore, of getting a cigar at
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:14.840]  about 10 o'clock at night when you're home and just getting a beer, a glass of wine,
[1:14:14.840 --> 1:14:20.680]  pouring that cigar up and sitting back and relaxing, I mean who are these rich people
[1:14:20.680 --> 1:14:23.160]  and powerful people who want more?
[1:14:23.160 --> 1:14:26.640]  You want more than a chili rianna?
[1:14:26.640 --> 1:14:29.320]  You want more than a beer?
[1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:31.600]  You want more than a beautiful woman?
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:32.600]  More?
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:37.720]  Like I want more, let me beat myself in the head with a hammer, but that's what aberrant
[1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:42.280]  people are into, they like the power of blowing up countries, they like the power of robbing
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:48.320]  banks, they like the power of kidnapping kids, they're screwed up.
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:53.360]  And those of us that aren't aberrant, we still are getting angry, we still have problems
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:58.080]  that still think bad things, you know, whatever, but we're guilty about it, you know, when
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:01.560]  I get mad at somebody and imagine punching them in the nose, I'm like that's not right,
[1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:02.760]  you shouldn't be like that.
[1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:08.040]  The point is these evil people are into not feeling bad, not having a conscience, not
[1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:15.800]  having a governor psychologically in them, and those of us that aren't evil, who aren't
[1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:19.520]  inherently lovers of evil, all of us are evil to a certain extent, we're also good to a
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:23.720]  certain extent, we're mixed, we're complex creatures.
[1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:28.780]  We can't imagine people want to do this, I mean that's what psychologists, police always
[1:15:28.780 --> 1:15:33.760]  say when they find a tank full of five dead kids, you know, in somebody's refrigerator,
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:36.800]  and it's like why?
[1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:40.400]  The cops will ask the guy, well they'll take him to jail, why the hell did you do this?
[1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:43.960]  Why grab five-year-olds off the street and torture him?
[1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:50.660]  Why are you asking why, just it's a psychopath, stop being naive, stop thinking bad things
[1:15:50.660 --> 1:15:57.320]  can't happen just because you wouldn't do them, okay?
[1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:01.440]  I mean I don't know why when I was like 11 years old, I got off the school bus and some
[1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:04.160]  older kids came over and said, you want to play baseball?
[1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:10.320]  And I said yeah, and I wouldn't got my baseball bat in my mitt, and I walked down to the woods
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:12.880]  where they were and they beat me up for an hour, and it's like why?
[1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:16.560]  Because they're little cowardly people who are four or five years older who want to beat
[1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:20.960]  somebody up, it doesn't matter, I'm not a vindictive person but I happen to run into
[1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:26.120]  most of them in the next few years, and you know what, some of them aren't the same today,
[1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:32.600]  and I'm not proud of that by the way, but the point is here is that we need people to
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:36.640]  stop being so childlike.
[1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:41.280]  We need people to stop being so naive, when I was a child I was a child, but as I became
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:47.280]  a man I gave up the things of a child, and I'm certainly taking on the things of a man,
[1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:50.720]  the good, the bad and the ugly, why do men do what they do?
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:54.320]  I didn't know why men did what they did when I was a little kid, now I understand it.
[1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:57.520]  I don't know why, it's what we do, you know what I mean?
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:02.080]  The good, the bad and the ugly, but when I was a child, I was a child, but when I became
[1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:08.280]  a man I gave up the things of a child, and you need to stop being childlike folks, that's
[1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:11.360]  the key to defeating the globalist, Mike Adams is coming up, we're gonna go to this
[1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:19.160]  piece here, what's the piece we're going to, before we come back with Adams, oh Zach
[1:17:19.160 --> 1:17:23.640]  and Houston, go ahead Zach, I'm sorry I didn't see you there, sorry I apologize, go ahead.
[1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:28.760]  Alexander, I got a money bomb workout for you.
[1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:39.440]  Yeah, I'm the dude, I gave you the American Silver Eagle and the Houston Federal Reserve.
[1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:41.320]  Well thank you sir.
[1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:46.800]  Silver coin, hell yeah, hey congratulations and thanks for waking us all up, I've earned
[1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:54.280]  over 5,000 DVDs and 2,000 a day of your stuff, and I'm just happy to be a donor to the money
[1:17:54.280 --> 1:17:59.720]  bomb, I don't make the wrong call, last year I threw you 800 bucks, I do AC, I scrap all
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:04.000]  my scrap metal, and you got it all brother, and we get it all, you know.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:07.840]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, I want you to spend your scrap metal money on making copies
[1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:13.200]  of my DVDs and giving them to people, but don't save your scrap metal to give it to
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:16.440]  us here, because then I'll feel guilty when I order the crew food or something, because
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:19.400]  I'll be realizing people are like, people are giving everything they got so we can sit
[1:18:19.400 --> 1:18:24.040]  around and eat pizza here, but I like to take care of the crew, but I mean listen,
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:31.800]  going back to this, the power of you Zach, the power of you making thousands of DVDs
[1:18:31.800 --> 1:18:35.600]  of my films and giving them out, that's innumerable, and there's the problem, they're coming out
[1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:40.160]  with new DVD players and computers, where if it's not stamped by a company, it won't
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:46.160]  even work, as if you have something pirated just because you copied something, again they're
[1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:52.880]  scared, everything's being built in with spy systems, so folks use the internet, I'm
[1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:57.960]  going to let you finish, but folks use the internet, use the DVDs, use everything while
[1:18:57.960 --> 1:19:03.000]  we still got it, we probably aren't always going to have it, FEMA in six days is practicing
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:06.040]  a total takeover of all the media, go ahead, sorry.
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:10.920]  No, I wanted to call in the other day, but I was working there, and believe me I make
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:15.880]  plenty on the air conditioning, the scrap metal is just line up, no I went in there
[1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:20.040]  and I wanted to call you when you asked about what's our takeoff, fast and curious and
[1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:26.040]  no one will call and bring up the topics, what my deal is, what about when they use their
[1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:32.000]  legal immigrant to shut down the Austin gun show, I mean it's the exact same, you know,
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  the same...
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:36.560]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, go back to that a year and a half ago, I said this is a Justice
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:41.720]  Department program using the threat of Mexico to take the guns at given press conferences,
[1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:46.760]  we've got all the proof, and it turned out all over the US, they used illegal immigrants,
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:51.880]  that they'd busted nice raids, who they said will make you legal if you go do this, and
[1:19:51.880 --> 1:19:58.320]  they'd go around all day with fake IDs till they found an American to sell them a gun,
[1:19:58.320 --> 1:20:02.880]  you know, a private sale, and yeah, that was set up, I'm glad you brought that up, remind
[1:20:02.880 --> 1:20:03.880]  people of that.
[1:20:03.880 --> 1:20:07.600]  Exactly, well, I'll let you get out there so you can get on with it.
[1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:12.600]  No, no, but go back to the time, I mean go back to the time that happened.
[1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:13.600]  What do you mean, sorry.
[1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:15.600]  No, no, tell the rest of the story for folks that forgot.
[1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:21.080]  Oh, yeah, there was a private buy which is perfectly legal to happen at a gun show in
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:27.080]  Austin, they sent in an undercover agent, but it was a Mexican national and a legal
[1:20:27.080 --> 1:20:33.240]  that was here and had been apprehended before, and they gave him, he had a legal, I guess,
[1:20:33.240 --> 1:20:38.000]  legal Texas identification card, and he went in and presented it, the guy did everything
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:41.440]  legally and lawfully, he said, hey, you know, like you're going to a gun show, some guy
[1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:44.960]  will just tell you a gun won't ask for nothing, and that's fine.
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:48.480]  But then this guy said, no, I want to see your ID because you're probably kind of suspicious.
[1:20:48.480 --> 1:20:55.440]  The guy is giving me ID, he writes down their phone, it's Texas, it's valid, it's in date,
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:59.960]  and I'll be damned if it wasn't a foreign law enforcement officer, and it's a total
[1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:06.560]  strongman operation, just like they did to Sally, and it's disgusting the way they want
[1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:10.680]  to do it, that's why everybody needs to offer themselves to the keys, in my opinion.
[1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:16.840]  No, we have a criminal government that is doing this with Mexico to get our guns so
[1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:22.800]  that this piece of trash can have our weapons, and we've got to just get the word out, these
[1:21:22.800 --> 1:21:27.960]  are crooks and stop, when young women would get in the car with Ted Bundy because they
[1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:31.920]  said he was wearing a suit, driving a non-threatening Volkswagen, and he'd torture the hell out
[1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:32.920]  of them.
[1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:37.840]  These are criminals scum who've been caught, they need to go to prison, they're illegitimate,
[1:21:37.840 --> 1:21:41.560]  I appreciate you, Zach, God bless you, I appreciate your support.
[1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:45.640]  We're going to go to this little piece of newscast and come back with Mike Adams for
[1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:49.120]  the next hour and a half at least, he'll cover the news, have his guest on, and take
[1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:54.320]  your calls, he's got breaking news, hey, no rest for the hillbilly though, I'm going
[1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:59.320]  to get out there, and I'm going to go over some of this news when I get back, and then
[1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:05.520]  David Eich was saying I want to be on at eight o'clock, New Zealand time, and then it was
[1:22:05.520 --> 1:22:09.400]  10 o'clock New Zealand time, so he'll probably be on later, he's been late before and gotten
[1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:14.200]  times unscrewed up, who couldn't, he's on, you know, he's 10,000, whatever miles away
[1:22:14.200 --> 1:22:20.240]  or whatever, more, New Zealand's on the total other side, is that, 12,000 miles, I forget,
[1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:23.360]  he's on the other side of the globe, we're working on that, we got Gerald Salente coming
[1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:27.800]  up a lot more, but Mike Adams is coming in here after this break, and I'll continue with
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:33.840]  your phone calls and a lot more, and a lot of news, so that's all coming up, it's infowarsmoneybomb.com,
[1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:39.640]  fair minimum, spread the word about the free video links at infowars.com or infowarsmoneybomb.com
[1:22:39.640 --> 1:22:45.680]  or prismpana.tv, and donate, I want to thank folks that have donated, thank you so much,
[1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:49.560]  that $100,000 plus that's come in, we can hire a couple crew members, and buy some of
[1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:54.480]  the equipment we need, but we need to raise the $500,000 to really kick it into high gear,
[1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:57.920]  or I can burn through the little bit of reserves we've got, everything's going to hell in a
[1:22:57.920 --> 1:23:01.880]  handbasket, whatever, the point is, it's your voluntary right to give to this if you believe
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:09.280]  in it, infowarsmoneybomb.com, we'll be back with Mike Adams, the health ranger of naturalnews.com,
[1:23:09.280 --> 1:23:10.280]  stay with us.
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:15.280]  This is the first time you've ever seen the mural?
[1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:21.360]  No, I live here, so I come through and check it out every now and then, I'm taking pictures,
[1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:27.320]  I read about it online, looked it up, what do you think it means?
[1:23:27.320 --> 1:23:32.560]  I can only tell you what I read, basically it seems like there's a soldier cutting through
[1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:40.080]  the dove of peace, and his sword is an Arabian sword, I'm not sure about the women and the
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:47.560]  angel type things, and the towers here, very familiar to a lot of people, kind of look
[1:23:47.560 --> 1:23:52.680]  like 9-1-1 towers, whatever, so I don't know, strange thing to have in this airport.
[1:23:52.680 --> 1:23:55.600]  What are your thoughts when you see something like this?
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:24:01.680]  I think it's very well done, it's impactful, color scheme's great, theme seems a little
[1:24:01.680 --> 1:24:06.520]  austere for an airport, but you don't think there's a nefarious hidden agenda, hidden
[1:24:06.520 --> 1:24:08.360]  meaning behind it or anything like that?
[1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:13.600]  I don't know, I've heard that theory a lot, maybe an underground prison's under Denver
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:18.160]  or DIA, all that stuff, could be a little skeptical.
[1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:19.960]  So this is the first time you've ever seen this mural?
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:21.800]  Yeah, the first time I've ever seen it.
[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:25.480]  Let's take a look, what are your thoughts when you look at something like that?
[1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:29.160]  Do you think it's kind of an odd mural to be put in an airport?
[1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:32.040]  Not necessarily, I think it explains a lot.
[1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:34.040]  Okay, such as?
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:39.280]  Such as, you know, America and everything else, there's a lot going on in the world
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:46.200]  right now, and it pretty much shows what's going on, there's a knight, he's taking care
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:50.600]  of things, there's people that are suffering, and he looks like he's taking over and taking
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:51.600]  care of it.
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:53.400]  So he's teached like a protector, you think?
[1:24:53.400 --> 1:24:58.480]  I think he's a protector, you know, I mean, you're wearing a gas mask and you have a sword
[1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:00.840]  in your hand, what else are you doing?
[1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:03.040]  Is this the first time you've ever seen the mural?
[1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:04.040]  Yes it is.
[1:25:04.040 --> 1:25:05.040]  I've seen it on the internet before.
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:08.440]  All right, so you've seen it on the internet, now I saw you turn the corner and you're like,
[1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:11.920]  oh my god, here it is, so all right, so what are your thoughts on it?
[1:25:11.920 --> 1:25:17.200]  I've heard some theories where there's like an underground facility in this airport, it's
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:20.920]  just like really dark and kind of scary looking.
[1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:22.920]  It is a little creepy looking, yeah, yeah.
[1:25:22.920 --> 1:25:28.200]  Mean gun wielding and the crying innocence in the background, yeah, it's kind of creepy
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:31.200]  but you're fleeing, that's real creepy.
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:37.560]  Oh it's just, I mean, this is kind of sad, obviously, some, a kid who died in Auschwitz,
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:43.600]  14 years old, that, you know, basically their childhood was taken away from them through
[1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:50.960]  everything they went through, it looks like, you know, they hate, they hate enemies, they
[1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:55.320]  hope that one day they'll be able to wake up and laugh again, it's sad that there's people
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:56.760]  out there that think like that.
[1:25:56.760 --> 1:26:00.840]  Some people say it's put here to kind of get, to distract people from really, what really
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:02.360]  goes on in DIA.
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:06.880]  Don't you think it's an odd place to put a mural like this in an international airport?
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:08.600]  I mean, it's kind of weird, isn't it?
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:12.360]  It is, like, I mean, if you wanted to put, if you wanted to send a message to someone,
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:14.160]  I mean, it's kind of the best place.
[1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:18.440]  So you think this is more of an artistic endeavor, you know, with the symbolism and everything,
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:23.440]  you know, this guy kind of looks like a Nazi, but is there any hidden meanings, a dark hidden
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:28.720]  meaning, or is this more kind of an artistic piece, you know?
[1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:33.720]  I think, I don't, I'm not someone who looks at things in a dark hidden type of way, so
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:38.520]  to me, I don't look at it like that, you know, the most disturbing piece of this whole thing
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:41.720]  is just that, that's what gets me the most.
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:45.520]  What about the rumors that there's a whole underground type of bunker here, have you heard
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:46.520]  those as well?
[1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:47.520]  I heard those.
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:50.240]  Do you think that there's any truth to that?
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:51.240]  Definitely.
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:52.240]  Possible.
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:54.040]  More possible than what they give you on the news.
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:59.000]  It looks funny, you know, that you can see, when you're coming in, you can see that there's
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.080]  construction's been over for years here, but there's construction everywhere, all over,
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:05.640]  going on, on the grounds of the airport.
[1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:06.640]  Constantly.
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:07.640]  Constantly.
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:10.840]  And you can see them actually working up, because once it's a hill, and you have a road
[1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:14.240]  that goes around it, and you come back a year later, and there's two roads, because the
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:18.680]  hills kind of moved up, as if the hills are expanding upwards.
[1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:22.600]  You think it's an odd place to have a mural like this, an international airport?
[1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:23.600]  Absolutely.
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:24.600]  Absolutely.
[1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:28.400]  I don't know what its place is here, or why it's here.
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:41.600]  It's definitely not something you expect to see walking through an airport, though.
[1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:45.360]  Countries of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:48.520]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:52.880]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:53.880]  at home.
[1:27:53.880 --> 1:27:59.000]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  shots.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:04.840]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:10.440]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:14.960]  bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes, constructing world government.
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:19.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:21.320]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:27.400]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:28.720]  of the Republic.
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:34.800]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right
[1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:42.320]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:48.480]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:52.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:59.000]  I tell you, as we get more and more dependent on computers, as we get more and more dependent
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:07.200]  on computers, it really illustrates the problems that we face as a society.
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:11.480]  Because David Ike is in the other side of the world, I think it's New Zealand, for an
[1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:15.240]  hour he's been sending us his phone number, because when he got up in the morning, he
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:17.760]  was going to give it to us, and it's not come through our email.
[1:29:17.760 --> 1:29:23.280]  So here he is, you know, 45 minutes later than he would have been, and he's been sending
[1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:24.280]  it.
[1:29:24.280 --> 1:29:25.280]  And I've seen that with emails.
[1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:27.080]  At my home, here, you name it.
[1:29:27.080 --> 1:29:31.680]  It's like they're going somewhere first, and then I get them later.
[1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:35.160]  It's just amazing, and they admit they're going through these, so who knows what's been
[1:29:35.160 --> 1:29:36.160]  going on.
[1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:38.840]  We're going to talk to David for about 30, 40 minutes, and then Mike Adams will be here
[1:29:38.840 --> 1:29:42.440]  for two hours, on them arresting people, selling raw milk.
[1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:46.960]  Now they're going up to folks drinking it, like it's PCP or something, you know, they've
[1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:47.960]  got to destroy it.
[1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:51.200]  First, Mike, you're going to be back in about 30, 40 minutes after we talked to David Ike,
[1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:56.160]  who, thank God, came through, his emails finally, three of them just came through, we can see
[1:29:56.160 --> 1:30:00.640]  the timestamps that they were held up, I guess, from the other side of the world, and I used
[1:30:00.640 --> 1:30:04.360]  to have took a year to get a letter, so it's not too bad, but something might be going
[1:30:04.360 --> 1:30:05.360]  on.
[1:30:05.360 --> 1:30:09.400]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, what's coming up when you're filling in for me coming up?
[1:30:09.400 --> 1:30:10.400]  All right.
[1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:11.520]  Well, first of all, big hello to David Ike.
[1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:12.640]  It's great that he's on.
[1:30:12.640 --> 1:30:17.040]  I just want to give a shout out to all of the natural news fans and listeners out there
[1:30:17.040 --> 1:30:21.000]  that I'll be back on right after David Ike, and we have a lot to cover, the raw milk
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:22.720]  protest that just took place.
[1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:27.800]  We've got guests calling in from Occupy, Oakland, and there was a lot of crazy stuff that went
[1:30:27.800 --> 1:30:28.800]  on there in the last day.
[1:30:28.800 --> 1:30:29.800]  An attack on Whole Foods.
[1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:30.800]  It's probably a provocateur.
[1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:32.200]  A Whole Foods attack, yeah.
[1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:33.200]  So that's who I have on.
[1:30:33.200 --> 1:30:37.160]  We got a lot of great information coming out, and people will definitely want to stay tuned
[1:30:37.160 --> 1:30:38.240]  and listen in for that.
[1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:39.240]  All right.
[1:30:39.240 --> 1:30:40.740]  Well, thank you, naturalnews.com.
[1:30:40.740 --> 1:30:41.740]  Thank you, Mike.
[1:30:41.740 --> 1:30:42.740]  We'll talk to you in a moment.
[1:30:42.740 --> 1:30:46.680]  Now going to David Ike for an abbreviated 30-minute interview because he's got stuff
[1:30:46.680 --> 1:30:47.680]  he's got to do.
[1:30:47.680 --> 1:30:48.680]  David, you're in New Zealand, right?
[1:30:48.680 --> 1:30:49.680]  Yes, Mike.
[1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:56.640]  I arrived literally a few hours ago, so I had a lot of sleep, but yeah, it's the last
[1:30:56.640 --> 1:31:02.760]  stage of an Australian New Zealand speaking tour, which has been unbelievable.
[1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:07.520]  If only one who wants to have confirmation that the world is waking up, just not parts
[1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:08.520]  of the world.
[1:31:08.520 --> 1:31:10.760]  They should have been with me in the last seven weeks.
[1:31:10.760 --> 1:31:17.520]  When you get 2,000 people turning up at one event in a place called the Gold Coast in Australia,
[1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:24.120]  you know, given that I've been here a few times and talked to a phone box often before,
[1:31:24.120 --> 1:31:26.800]  you know that there's a wake-up going on worldwide.
[1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:29.040]  Well, there certainly is.
[1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:32.480]  I mean, I'm seeing this wake-up worldwide.
[1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:37.480]  People who aren't well-known or whose faces aren't recognizable kind of feel like they're
[1:31:37.480 --> 1:31:42.280]  alone, but when you are a David Ike or a George Norrie or an Alex Jones, you do run into the
[1:31:42.280 --> 1:31:43.280]  people.
[1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:46.960]  And I'm telling you, David, 10 years ago, maybe one out of 15 people I walked by on
[1:31:46.960 --> 1:31:49.440]  the street anywhere in the U.S. would stop and talk to me.
[1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:50.920]  Now it's every four or five.
[1:31:50.920 --> 1:31:55.880]  I can't go out in public now, and I must be wild for you, and it's not, oh, look, we're
[1:31:55.880 --> 1:31:56.880]  well-known.
[1:31:56.880 --> 1:31:57.880]  We're celebrities.
[1:31:57.880 --> 1:32:00.960]  You were a celebrity before you even got involved in this stuff, champion goalie, national
[1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:02.880]  TV host, have the Green Party.
[1:32:02.880 --> 1:32:05.240]  But are you not seeing the same thing now?
[1:32:05.240 --> 1:32:09.160]  The feedback, and I think it's important for those of us that are recognized to be able
[1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:12.760]  to tell the public the dominoes have already fallen.
[1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:15.240]  That's why the elite's getting ready to start all these new wars.
[1:32:15.240 --> 1:32:19.320]  David, what's happening in Europe with the Vatican calling for world government global
[1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:24.960]  currency, the open call for Israel to attack Iran, it seems like the quickening is upon
[1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:25.960]  us.
[1:32:25.960 --> 1:32:26.960]  Yes, it is.
[1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:34.240]  I mean, there comes a point, I said it years ago, when something's being manipulated covertly
[1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:41.480]  into place, that can go on for a while, but there comes a point where the new society
[1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:47.160]  that you want to introduce has to break the surface where it can be seen.
[1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:52.000]  And that's what we're seeing now, this window of opportunity where it's not some time over
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:56.600]  the rainbow anymore, it's not, this is coming if, it's here, it's how deeply are we going
[1:32:56.600 --> 1:33:01.680]  to allow it to go in, and how much are we going to pull it back from where it's already
[1:33:01.680 --> 1:33:14.400]  got, and so we're now seeing the real blatant unfolding and calling for this whole structure
[1:33:14.400 --> 1:33:18.680]  of global fascist centralized control that we've been talking about all these years.
[1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:23.320]  And I think there's another thing here as well, which I've been aware of, Alex, for
[1:33:23.320 --> 1:33:31.320]  a long, long time, and that is that as this awakening, more and more manifests itself,
[1:33:31.320 --> 1:33:36.240]  and although these protests around the world, lots and lots of people involved, fantastic
[1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:42.080]  that they're doing that, but they have to get street-wise to the game that's being played,
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:46.200]  otherwise the game will play them and use their genuineness to do it.
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:52.840]  But this awakening is reaching the point where a massive Rubicon has been crossed.
[1:33:52.840 --> 1:34:00.520]  It's like in the Matrix movie where Neo is asked to accept the fact that he's a slave.
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:02.640]  It's the big, big Rubicon.
[1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:05.720]  Okay, I understand my situation.
[1:34:05.720 --> 1:34:07.200]  I'm a slave.
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:13.040]  Next thing, I'm not having it anymore, and this is where these protests, the genuine
[1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:16.280]  people out there around the world doing this, they've crossed that line.
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:17.800]  I realize I'm a slave.
[1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:23.840]  I realize the world is deeply corrupt beyond anything I thought before, and I'm not having
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:24.840]  it.
[1:34:24.840 --> 1:34:29.720]  Now the next stage is to get street-wise, because if that doesn't happen, then you can
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:36.200]  get manipulated into calling for things, but that force which you are out there challenging
[1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:43.520]  actually wants to introduce, and so what we're seeing, for instance, now in Europe, is the
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:48.400]  Euro being basically attacked because of a simple reason.
[1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:51.120]  People say, well, it's not good for the Euro that it's not working.
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:53.040]  It's not supposed to work.
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:58.080]  They want a one-world, single electronic currency.
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:03.600]  Therefore, they have to make currencies in all the forms that they are now not to work
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:07.520]  so they can offer the solution and the solution until they get to that point of a single electronic
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:08.520]  currency.
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:12.360]  So what the Euro has been is a stocking horse.
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:19.000]  All over Europe, you had Belira, the Frank, the Deutschmark, all these different currencies.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:23.240]  Now if you want a one-world currency, you've got to mop them up, and if you've got to mop
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:28.720]  them up one after the other in terms of individual countries, then it's going to take you a long
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:29.720]  while.
[1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:36.560]  So you introduce a single currency for all those former multiple currencies in Europe,
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:38.000]  and you introduce the Euro.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.440]  Now the Euro's gone, the Frank's gone, the Deutschmark's gone, you can want elsewhere,
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:42.440]  you've done it.
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:45.200]  Apart from one or two like Britain, I still have the pound.
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:49.800]  But then, next stage, you've got to make eventually the Euro not work, because that's not your
[1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:50.800]  end product.
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:56.680]  But your single electronic currency is your end product, and thus we're seeing the undermining
[1:35:56.680 --> 1:35:57.680]  of the Euro.
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:36:01.880]  I'm not saying it will disappear tomorrow, but it will disappear eventually, and for
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:06.400]  it to disappear, it's got to be made not to work, and for people to think something has
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:09.920]  to replace it, and that's the way we're going all over the world.
[1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:15.920]  When you've got the Vatican, which is the Church of Babylon relocated, I mean you do the historical
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:20.600]  research, the Church of Babylon relocated to Rome, they just changed the names.
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:28.320]  And so it's absolutely in line with the whole plot that a Vatican organization would come
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:36.360]  out and join George Soros and all these other people, calling for a central bank, a World
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:37.360]  Central Bank.
[1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:40.480]  And this is the big point, Alex, in terms of the protesters, because I've seen some
[1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:46.920]  of this over the last few weeks, where people are being manipulated to, some of them anyway,
[1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:56.720]  to call for some kind of democratic world authority to take over the banks, you know,
[1:36:56.720 --> 1:37:00.800]  democratic control of the banks and all this stuff, it's the scam, it's what they want.
[1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:03.400]  I mean, let's just analyze this.
[1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:13.800]  We have got into this mess of the control of the few over the many, in a simple process,
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:20.240]  the constant, incessant centralization of power in all areas of our lives, they gave
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:24.800]  it a name decades ago, globalization, that's just the agenda unfolding.
[1:37:24.800 --> 1:37:31.320]  So we got into this situation because control of the banking system is in the hands of so
[1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:38.480]  few people, therefore the few dictate and run the financial system for the many, this
[1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:41.800]  is where this whole thing about the 1% and 99% has come from.
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:47.000]  You look at government centralization of power, centralization of power in Europe now, because
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:54.040]  the European Parliament is just a talking shop to give the illusion of any kind of democratic
[1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:59.120]  process in the European Union, and it's dictated from Brussels by dark suits that are appointed
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:00.520]  by the cabal.
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:07.560]  So now the central few in Europe are dictating to the whole European population that they're
[1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:09.200]  involved in the European Union.
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:15.160]  So we're in this mess now where countries like Greece cannot individually respond to
[1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:21.800]  their problems, they have to do it collectively through this centralized organization because
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:24.160]  they're all members of the same currency, the euro.
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:29.680]  And where I'm going with this is this, we have got into the situation that has got people
[1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:35.160]  onto the streets of the world for the incessant centralization of power.
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:40.960]  So are we going to say the answer to that is even more centralization of power?
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:45.040]  Let's talk here, take it on to a global level now, instead of having the European central
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:50.120]  bank dictating the economies and currencies of Europe, let's have a world central bank
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:54.680]  and then they can do it to every country in the world, it's the other way surely we need
[1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:55.680]  to go.
[1:38:55.680 --> 1:39:03.680]  When the cabal has spent centuries and more incessantly centralizing power in the world,
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:08.280]  it's because it suits them, it's because the more you centralize power, the more power
[1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:12.440]  the few have over the many, and the more you centralize power, the more power you then
[1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:16.880]  have to centralize even quicker, this is why the speed of globalization as it's called
[1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:23.120]  has got quicker and quicker and quicker, so they want to go incessantly towards centralization
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:28.560]  of power on a global level, therefore we the people surely want to go the other way where
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:34.520]  people in their communities are having a say in the decision making over their communities
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:39.640]  where there's such diversity of power that no central cabal can run a state, never mind
[1:39:39.640 --> 1:39:44.360]  a country, never mind a world, this is the way we need to go and I just say this to the
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:51.560]  people on the streets in the protest, if anyone comes along, organizations or individuals
[1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:58.520]  or whatever and they're calling for a centralization of power on a global level to solve the problem
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:05.280]  that these people are protesting about, then they're either completely ignorant of the
[1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:10.000]  way the game is being played and where the game wants to go or they are manipulating
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.400]  you on behalf of the game.
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:17.280]  David very powerfully said and that's what the trilateral commission said they would
[1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:23.760]  do in the 70s and it's so transparent to those of us that are awake that we see clearly
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:29.360]  they always hold you hostage and say give more centralization to us and then the crisis
[1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:35.240]  only gets worse and they say okay now I've got you deeper in, give us more.
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:39.640]  But these vampires are being exposed, I mean I'll tell you now Jesse Ventura is trying
[1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:43.800]  to get a hold of you and a lot of his material he wasn't convinced of but the deeper he gets
[1:40:43.800 --> 1:40:47.160]  into it you know he's looking at the fact that they're trying to suppress what you're
[1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:53.000]  doing because it could end the whole existing religious order so I do when the interview
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:56.720]  ends want to try to give you their number so they can hopefully interview you even if
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:01.520]  it's for Skype for the TV show and in the TV show you know I'm not naive like I was
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:05.880]  12 years ago and turned the punch pole but I played devil's advocate I say people didn't
[1:41:05.880 --> 1:41:09.560]  believe what David Ike had to say before and some would say that makes us feel powerless
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:13.960]  that it's this off-world power but you know there's a lot of credence to what he has to
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:18.000]  say so you need to talk to David Ike you know I've been interviewed by him and I send him
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:23.680]  to you so I hope that that happens because you know that's part of their whole research
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:28.400]  I know you're very busy but I think actually I think I'm going to talk to him later today
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:32.320]  which will be good you know I listened to an interview you did with Fritz Springmeyer
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:38.840]  the other day and I see what's happened to Fritz and stuff and I met Fritz a long time
[1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:45.360]  ago and this stuff that you know we've been talking about about the Satanism, the worshiping
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:52.440]  of the gods, the blood-drinking and all that stuff did you know they've confirmed in Canada
[1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:56.760]  I mean just to interrupt you this is in like the Globe and Mail in Toronto Star that at
[1:41:56.760 --> 1:42:01.720]  these reservations over half the kids were being killed and now they have witnesses
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:05.840]  that say the Queen of England 30 years ago was there and took 10 kids with her I mean
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:10.600]  this is in the Canadian news this is crazy I'm sorry go ahead I saw that Alex and of
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:15.680]  course at least a number of the witnesses that they saw her but no longer alive you
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:21.240]  know I mean it's funny I've been in Australia and I offered the Queen a ticket but she didn't
[1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:25.920]  turn up because she was out here at the same time right but she was getting into Satanism
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:29.280]  and I don't know how to get up yeah she was having a walkabout in Melbourne when I was
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:36.920]  there I was hilarious really but and you see people bowing to them and there was this controversy
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:42.200]  and scandal that the Prime Minister of Australia didn't curtsy when she met the Queen I mean
[1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:48.240]  it's unbelievable that the level of childishness that some people in this world are involved
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:53.880]  in but the thing about Satanism it's a wider point Alex really and I completely understand
[1:42:53.880 --> 1:43:00.040]  it and this is why the challenge now for people who are waking up to hey the world's
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:06.120]  not like I thought it was it is a real challenge to way open the mind it's like Socrates in
[1:43:06.120 --> 1:43:10.640]  the nation Greece as opposed to said wisdom is knowing how little we know well you know
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:15.760]  it's not that you believe everything you don't but you don't dismiss things by reflex action
[1:43:15.760 --> 1:43:21.360]  just because they're so different because this is the point the difference between
[1:43:21.360 --> 1:43:25.720]  the world that we're sold through our lives through the media and the education system
[1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:30.560]  and all the rest of it the world as it works and what's going on the powers that are deciding
[1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:39.440]  things is so unbelievable breathtakingly, staggeringly different to the world that's really going
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:44.880]  on in the shadows and what's going on in the shadows but that chasm is a real challenge
[1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:50.440]  for people to to to leap to think from their perspective of a lifetime about this is how
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:55.280]  the world works this is why I've always understood it to leap into what's actually going on we're
[1:43:55.280 --> 1:44:02.360]  investigating that chasm yeah it's a major challenge but we need to do it because the
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:08.840]  rabbit hole is very very deep and the deep you go in the rabbit hole not only do you
[1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:15.760]  understand so much more what it's like is when we're looking at the banking scams and
[1:44:15.760 --> 1:44:20.880]  the political scams and the engineered wars and all these things that need to be exposed
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:26.000]  and what we're all doing our best to do it symbolically we're actually looking at a movie
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:30.560]  when it's hit the screen what when you go deeper in the rabbit hole and deeper in the
[1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:34.840]  rabbit hole you get closer and closer to the projector that's projecting onto that screen
[1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:41.840]  in other words all the stuff in the background that manifests plays out as many dark suits
[1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:46.960]  manipulating the banking system and orchestrating 9-11 and all that and that stuff and the people
[1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:52.920]  in the military doing that intelligence and so you get closer and closer not only to understanding
[1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:58.720]  the real force behind the world that we experience every day but also the answers to it how to
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:04.520]  unravel it because that's where the answers lie as well and these people have been involved
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:09.440]  in satanic ritual these bloodlines right back to the ancient world for a long time because
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:18.600]  of the way humanity in general had attitudes at that time they did it openly they did open
[1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:24.240]  sacrifices to the gods and by the way this isn't an important point they sacrificed
[1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:29.880]  young virgins to the gods what's young virgins code for children there's a reason for this
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:38.560]  that the children's energy changes at puberty we see a hormonal change at puberty but actually
[1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:43.680]  it's an energetic change which manifests through as a hormonal change these people want that
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:50.360]  child's energy before that change takes place that we call puberty when they move in towards
[1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:54.400]  they want the purity they want the innocence and I want to raise this to you that's why
[1:45:54.400 --> 1:45:58.920]  I'm glad that's why I'm glad you're here David I want to go over this point with you
[1:45:58.920 --> 1:46:06.440]  I remember you over a decade ago talking about this Fritz as well but you even before talking
[1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:11.880]  about the transylvanian bloodlines the british royalty really isn't even british they're
[1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:17.000]  german but they're not german they're transylvanian now the prince of wales who calls for world
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:22.640]  population reduction and all the rest of this he has come out and he's bought a house in
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:30.000]  transylvania the carpathian mountains and forest he says yes my main ancestor is vladian
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:36.640]  paler and then vlad had all these kids that killed kids and bathed in their blood these
[1:46:36.640 --> 1:46:41.360]  women this is count Dracula and now he's hanging out a lot of the time in transylvania and
[1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:47.640]  again these legends all go back to at least something real and then you see the british
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:52.600]  royalty which is really transylvanian pushing world government pushing population reduction
[1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:58.160]  pushing cancer viruses world bank programs in Uganda and Honduras mainstream news the
[1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:04.160]  last month mowing villagers down to take their property these really are the psychic vampires
[1:47:04.160 --> 1:47:10.120]  bare minimum and some say maybe David I right maybe it's not vampires it's something else
[1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:15.120]  but I mean my god who could make this I remember you talking about that 15 years ago why is
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:21.520]  it now manifesting why is he taking on his transylvanian bloodline and literally reportedly
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:29.160]  moving into the birthplace of vladian paler well you know mary of tech who was the grandmother
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:33.040]  of the present queen and it was the grandmother present queen she is a direct descendant from
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:37.240]  the sister of black drackel so the whole the whole staff is in there and black drackel
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:45.400]  of course was that whole family that he was part of was the inspiration for the Dracula
[1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:52.520]  stories and you know like I say you know these people have been doing it openly before humanity
[1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:57.440]  grew up to a large extent and it was no longer acceptable and now they do it behind the scenes
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:48:04.520]  but they're doing the same same things and you know vlad vlad drackel he used to impale
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:11.280]  the people on on on spears and stuff and then they just let them rot to death but now they
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:15.480]  admit the british royal to even a hundred two hundred three hundred years ago was eating
[1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:21.200]  human flesh i just showed a daily mail i know i know but but of course it is like i said
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:25.600]  in my lady's book you know it wasn't a hundred years ago the last time that human that the
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:30.240]  royal family uh at human flesh it was probably a week last tuesday you know what i mean i
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:35.200]  mean it's that this is the chasm alex that i was talking about a few minutes ago the
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:40.840]  chasm to uh encompass at least the possibility and it's more than possibility this is this
[1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:47.200]  is this is fact but at least the possibility that these people that we see on cnn and the
[1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:51.640]  bbc and the queens and the royal and that's the other point then that's not the you know
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:55.840]  you made the point now about german and then transylvania but that's the same as the spanish
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:49:01.640]  royal family the danish royal family the swedish royal family um the belgium royal family
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:08.800]  the um uh the norwegian royal family when you when you look at them they're like branches
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:14.440]  of the same bloodline network and thus they are like chief executive officers placed into
[1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:21.840]  countries to to to run the show on behalf of the cabal and of course when um we had
[1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:29.120]  this uh resistance to overt in your face royal dictatorship and and what we call politics
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:35.880]  uh started to move in and take that over because it was it was the power to the people some
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:41.040]  of these uh bloodlines stayed in overt royal situations like the british royal family and
[1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:47.440]  etc and those others but a lot of the other royal bloodlines that still proceed as as
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:51.520]  royal because they have a particular genetics they went into the dark suit professions they
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:56.440]  went into into run the banks and run the politics run the transnational corporations and so
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:50:02.440]  this bloodline which it's like it's like the um uh the the the peak of an iceberg tip
[1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:08.040]  of an iceberg the tip of the iceberg of the bloodline is is what you can see uh people
[1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:12.840]  that are in certain positions of power and head of state because of their genetics like
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:18.840]  the british royal family but under the water under the scanner under the radar of that
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:24.600]  uh that uh iceberg are all these bloodlines like the rottschilds the rockefellows and
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:29.400]  and and what have you who are the same bloodline network but they wear dark suits instead of
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:33.880]  the coronets but it's the same thing and and and it's often the ones that don't wear the
[1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:39.200]  coronets that have more power in the network than those who do so um it's uh well let's
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:44.840]  go back to dracula though all of them are involved in this satanism because that blood
[1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:48.760]  that's what that bloodline does i explained it but david let me stop you let me stop
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:54.120]  you because as this becomes more apparent it becomes more and more as i'd research
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:57.760]  more and more it becomes more apparent that you're on to something we have all these
[1:50:57.760 --> 1:51:02.800]  archetypes i have now it's any more interesting the greeks the greeks would actually have hunting
[1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:08.240]  of vampires uh the romans did it every culture feared this whether they were psychopaths that
[1:51:08.240 --> 1:51:11.840]  thought they were people that needed blood or whatever the point is this group has always
[1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:17.040]  been amongst us they get into power they set up public bloodletting public sacrifice
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  nero that's absolutely right nero's on record sacrificed to them nero dressed up like a werewolf
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:28.880]  and would go at public parties and chain down a slave and chew out their throat that's mainline
[1:51:28.880 --> 1:51:35.120]  history show why where is this going what are they going to do as we awaken how does it tie into
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:39.200]  the satanism because whatever's behind it the point is these people are there we have the
[1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:45.920]  archetypal aristocrat in the tuxedo with the cloak who's really a blood drinking killer i mean what
[1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:53.600]  is the legends telling us well i mean let's just go it is some way deep into this from from from
[1:51:53.600 --> 1:52:00.080]  where this is coming from from my point of view when you do the research of uh ancient legends
[1:52:00.080 --> 1:52:06.400]  and uh accounts and and and and what people call myths but myths of it's such an ancient myth of
[1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:14.800]  such a symbolic truth when you get into them deeply um they talk of a uh a reptilian type race
[1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:21.280]  that came to earth and um started to uh manipulate and impose itself on humanity and one of the
[1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:27.120]  interesting things is and i think very very significant is every single one of these legends
[1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:34.320]  in different parts of the world talk about the fact that these reptilian entities demanded human
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:40.320]  sacrifice the legends in southern africa say that these uh chitohori the children of the
[1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:46.560]  serpents as they call them uh introduce cannibalism which didn't happen before they arrived and
[1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:55.040]  and when you have these ancient uh stories legends accounts of the uh sacrificing human
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:53:00.240]  humans to the gods children overwhelmingly to the gods then these are the gods they were
[1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:07.120]  sacrificing them to because you know let's get into it these entities operate overwhelmingly
[1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:14.400]  outside of this incredibly narrow band of human visual side which is called visible light it's
[1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:21.440]  unbelievable how narrow band of frequency that we are actually um perceiving when we look through
[1:53:21.440 --> 1:53:26.960]  our eyes compared with this is mainstream science compared with what is uh actually existing in
[1:53:26.960 --> 1:53:33.360]  this universe on other frequency ranges that we can't access so when these entities are operating
[1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:41.440]  outside of of the visible light human frequency range we can't see them and um they uh find it
[1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:45.280]  difficult to come into our frequency range because you know because they're they're a different
[1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:52.800]  frequency uh entity so what they've done is they created uh hybrid blood lines which we
[1:53:52.800 --> 1:53:59.920]  call the illuminati blood lines and they have a greater infusion of reptilian genetics um what
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:05.360]  from what um uh people have told me uh there's uh more copper in the blood of these hybrids
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:11.520]  and thus in a certain chemical process their blood turns a greeny blue color which which
[1:54:11.520 --> 1:54:16.560]  they tell me is the reason for calling these aristocratic and royal blood lines the blue blood
[1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:25.920]  and uh so what they've done is created um representatives within the frequency range
[1:54:25.920 --> 1:54:33.360]  visible light that we uh experience to run this reality our world on behalf of these hidden masters
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:38.800]  and the thing is that if you have everything in the end again this is mainstream science and quantum
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:45.360]  physics if you get into it everything no matter how solid it looks its basis is a vibrational
[1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:51.520]  information field it's a it's a frequency field a waveform field that is vibrating to a certain
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:58.240]  frequency if it vibrates to a very slow frequency then it manifests uh in our world as something
[1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:03.920]  that's really solid like a rock or you know a wooden table if it's vibrating much quicker it
[1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:10.320]  becomes much more ethereal in the way that that it manifests in our in our reality and so therefore
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:19.040]  if you can get the genetics closer to to the these entities then there is a vibrational
[1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:25.280]  compatibility a frequency compatibility with these hybrid blood lines that is much closer
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:30.720]  to these hidden entities than the general run of the global population therefore and again this is
[1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:38.480]  an ancient ancient um uh theme that goes back as far as known human history possession uh that
[1:55:38.480 --> 1:55:43.920]  is still being talked about today and it's true these entities possess because of this vibrational
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:49.760]  compatibility they have much greater than the general human population they can control it connect
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:55.760]  with and control their mental what passes for their emotional processes and therefore so basically
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:56:00.640]  we're like robots for them all i know is this david let me say this alexa this is this is
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:05.680]  really simplified in a minute what i'm trying to say you know when scientists are um they're
[1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:11.920]  working with material that's too dangerous so the material goes into a tank and the scientists
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:17.200]  stand outside the tank and they put their arms in the tank through those big long gloves so that
[1:56:17.200 --> 1:56:23.680]  they can work with the material while being outside the tank yes if you take that tank to be our world
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:30.960]  you take the scientists to be these entities and you take those gloves to be the illuminati blood
[1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:37.680]  lines that run the world uh uh at the moment that's the the dynamic that's the relationship between
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:42.240]  them so these people like the rock of fellas and the rock stars and the british royal families
[1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:49.440]  they're just they're just puppets in their own way as well but but because they look human um and
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:55.760]  have different names they hide the fact that there is a specific force behind this um which is which
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:57:02.400]  is orchestrating all of this stuff and and these gods as they perceive them they're the gods that
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:08.560]  these bloodlines do the rituals to do the sacrifice to for this reason when they are sacrificing
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:18.080]  um as someone there is a release of absolute terror and that energy of terror a fear of
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:25.040]  of unbelievable levels of terror that is absorbed by these entities and they feed off it it's their
[1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:34.320]  sustenance and then at the same time when this unimaginable level of terror uh is manifest
[1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:43.520]  a particular adrenaline enters the bloodstream um and the uh the satanists in human form shall we
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:49.680]  say that are performing the ritual within our world they then drink the blood with that adrenaline in
[1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:56.640]  it and and they get a high just like the you know the highest drug you could imagine they go crazy
[1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:02.160]  and if people ever watch that uh movie series blade when they went crazy and the rituals with
[1:58:02.160 --> 1:58:07.120]  the blood and everything that is based on fact that's what happens that's what some of the most
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:12.720]  famous people on this planet are doing and this is the custom we have to we have to uh uh leap
[1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:20.720]  well look all i know is the globalist when i was at bohemian grove 11 years ago and stuck in
[1:58:21.680 --> 1:58:27.520]  they were taking it serious they were in high religious reverence right and there's no doubt
[1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:33.360]  the elites do believe that they are involved in the occult skull and bones all of it and that
[1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:39.520]  is our ruling class and there's no doubt that every culture has these legends and that every
[1:58:39.520 --> 1:58:45.200]  culture then manifested human sacrifice blood drinking all of this so why did every human
[1:58:45.200 --> 1:58:50.560]  culture do this because i'll tell you right now i is just a normal human have zero in fact i have a
[1:58:50.560 --> 1:58:58.720]  negative desire to drink blood or sacrifice somebody so why in every ruling class in every
[1:58:58.720 --> 1:59:05.040]  culture does this manifest that's what adds credence to what you're saying yeah exactly how
[1:59:05.040 --> 1:59:11.040]  do you think it's it's the genetics what genetics is to to these people who understand that mean
[1:59:11.040 --> 1:59:16.960]  that genetic uh you know obsessed with genetics which to them is a form of technology well they
[1:59:16.960 --> 1:59:20.400]  knew about it before it happened they said we're going to discover the dna we're going to have
[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:27.280]  eugenics 160 years ago and they pioneered the whole system yeah and the genetics is like a software
[1:59:27.280 --> 1:59:37.120]  program and the software program in these hybrid bloodlines includes a desire to do all the things
[1:59:37.120 --> 1:59:42.640]  that the vast majority of the rest of the population would find you know beyond belief that anyone could
[1:59:42.640 --> 1:59:48.480]  do it like blood drinking sacrifice it's in the genetics it's like a software program playing
[1:59:48.480 --> 1:59:54.000]  through them and therefore i've said so many times over the last 21 years since i started
[1:59:54.000 --> 2:00:03.200]  going into all this if if people perceive what these bloodlines would do on the basis of what
[2:00:03.200 --> 2:00:08.480]  they themselves would or would not do you've completely lost the plot because these if we
[2:00:08.480 --> 2:00:13.840]  could look through the eyes alex of these hybrid bloodlines the rockersbellers the royals the the
[2:00:13.840 --> 2:00:21.040]  the rotschaus etc we would be beyond shocked at the way they were perceiving reality uh
[2:00:21.040 --> 2:00:25.600]  compared with the way most humans perceive reality see one of the things this is a really
[2:00:25.600 --> 2:00:31.600]  important point one of the things that this software program i'm calling these uh hybrid
[2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:41.360]  bloodlines one of the key things that's been deleted from them is empathy the the the ability
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:50.080]  to feel for the consequences and the feelings of others that you put in in terrible positions
[2:00:50.080 --> 2:00:56.480]  that empathy is a fail safe mechanism for human behavior because we look in a child's face alex
[2:00:56.480 --> 2:01:02.800]  and the thought of of sacrificing that child the thought of terrorizing that child of sexually
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:09.920]  abusing that child the very empathy alone deletes anything any any no it's more than that it's more
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:15.520]  than that i'm i'm like tony montana i'm ready to kill anybody wants to hurt a child i don't have
[2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:20.800]  a lust for violence and things like that except when somebody's hurting a child i'm ready to kick
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:26.080]  20 people's ass david the thought of somebody hurting a child i'm ready to stomp 20 people on
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:32.080]  the ground and i'm not a tough guy but i'm ready to absolutely open a can of clobber in time and
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:38.400]  so i can't and that's why good people are blind we can't imagine that the evil is even into this
[2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:46.800]  yeah the point i'm making is though that that process of feeling empathy for the suffering
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:54.400]  of the child they do not have the ability to feel that that this is the key because that this hybrid
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:02:01.840]  genetics has deleted that is deleted on purpose because you don't want people representing your
[2:02:01.840 --> 2:02:07.360]  horrific agenda for humanity if they have a conscience the last thing that you want because
[2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:13.040]  that's the that's going to make it much more difficult to to to get those people so in your
[2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:18.800]  research i would have zero of this hybrid stuff if i feel absolutely violent towards anybody wants
[2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:26.320]  to hurt a child well no what i would say is um you know if you have a feeling that you can hurt
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:31.280]  people and uh anybody i'm not talking about you i'm talking about in general hurt people and not
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:37.280]  have any feelings for the the the the what they are suffering what they are feeling as the result
[2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:44.400]  of your actions well that is a lack of empathy and this is why um pepper bombing bag dad pepper
[2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:51.680]  bombing uh uh zibby a triple e a third uh uh with full of civilians uh killing 2000 people on
[2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:59.520]  9 11 for the rest of us the the feeling of empathy with their suffering with their their trauma with
[2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:06.240]  it's overwhelming it's torture with with the with the parents and the uh the uh the loved ones
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:13.360]  of people on 9 11 that alone would stop us even thinking or dreaming about doing it you delete
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:19.360]  that alex there are no limits there are no uh you know buffer stops on behavior and because
[2:03:19.360 --> 2:03:23.600]  there are no emotional well let me spend on that though have you seen the little three-year-old
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:28.640]  girl with a whole lower mandible blown off with a tongue hanging out screaming and panic and pain
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:34.640]  for us that's torture but you're saying for the illuminati that's music that that that it well look
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:42.080]  look alex let's let's let's look at look at this uh again in a very simple way if you are capable
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:50.720]  without empathy without feeling to sacrifice a child and and go through the the ritual that builds
[2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:56.960]  up and builds up and builds up to it building systematically the terror in that child are you
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:05.280]  gonna have a give a damn about uh a child blown apart by a nato bomb no you're gonna think it's
[2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:11.280]  great you're gonna think it's fun you i mean you know in so many ways uh may you know that little
[2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:17.760]  12-second clip of Hillary clinton glorifying in the death of g'daffy that was been going around
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:24.720]  the internet that absolutely in a very very encapsulated 12-second way um very mild compared
[2:04:24.720 --> 2:04:31.840]  with what they do in in in the shadow we came we saw he died encapsulated these people's attitude
[2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:39.200]  to the human population yeah we came we saw he died it is and the reporter giggles with demonic
[2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:45.760]  pleasure and uh hillary and the word is they had agreed to have him surrender hillary was what the
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:52.480]  sign she landed they set him up he came out in a white flag and they killed him yeah absolutely
[2:04:52.480 --> 2:05:01.040]  and and and you know until we um uh breach this chasm and and realize what we're really
[2:05:01.040 --> 2:05:08.400]  dealing with um a level of uh what people call evil i mean that's even a word that doesn't
[2:05:08.400 --> 2:05:17.200]  describe it a a a a level of of darkness of of of beyond our imagination to comprehend
[2:05:17.200 --> 2:05:22.640]  uh where that where the depths that they're coming from that is the power that is running
[2:05:22.640 --> 2:05:27.280]  nato that is running governments that is running the banking system this is why let's look at this
[2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:33.440]  again this is why they'll crash the banking system to get a massive problem to which they
[2:05:33.440 --> 2:05:40.240]  could advance their agenda with a solution they look at the look at the people in 10 cities across
[2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:49.680]  america could bloody cry when i see it and decent people with their families who are out of out of
[2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:54.240]  work and can't pay their mortgage and because of the banks who then come across and take their house
[2:05:54.240 --> 2:06:00.080]  away and they can do that they can look at the television every night and see this this stuff
[2:06:00.080 --> 2:06:05.440]  and then go on the internet and they can see the suffering of vast numbers of people in greece in
[2:06:05.440 --> 2:06:11.520]  in in in in america and all over the world they can see that unbelievable suffering in what's become
[2:06:11.520 --> 2:06:18.320]  the third world where they they make their products for cents on a dollar uh uh in starvation wages in
[2:06:18.320 --> 2:06:23.040]  sweatshops and then ship them across the world in charge as much as they can get for them they can
[2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:29.760]  do that they can do all of that this is the mentality that's behind it the same mentality
[2:06:29.760 --> 2:06:35.120]  that can sacrifice a child will have no problem doing that the vast numbers of people well david
[2:06:35.120 --> 2:06:38.400]  it's more than that and this is why i want to close with you in the last five six minutes we have
[2:06:38.400 --> 2:06:45.680]  left the genetic engineering the the the the the un releasing mosquitoes that forcibly inoculate us
[2:06:45.680 --> 2:06:51.920]  bill gates making jokes about killing grandma to create 10 jobs the reduction in fertility
[2:06:52.480 --> 2:06:58.480]  the the the autism exploding this culture of death i want david ike to tell us now
[2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:03.680]  you know whatever these psychopaths are they might as well be blood drinking whatever i mean
[2:07:03.680 --> 2:07:08.720]  they're they're they're psycho demons whatever they are who don't have empathy and who don't have a
[2:07:08.720 --> 2:07:15.760]  soul and who are my eternal enemy what is their in game you say they're running out of time but
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:21.120]  if they had their way what are we facing what's coming up this great challenge what do they want
[2:07:21.120 --> 2:07:26.560]  to set up in this world because no doubt the awakenings happening they're coming in both feet down
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:31.840]  trying to keep us down david ike what are we about to see what is their in game and how
[2:07:31.840 --> 2:07:38.000]  does the battle end how does it unravel i mean you know sum it up well well just very quickly
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:44.240]  to start with you you you mentioned there the obsession with death uh well you know we think
[2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:49.280]  about radio stations if you're if you're broadcasting on radio one you're not going to connect with
[2:07:49.280 --> 2:07:54.560]  radio two it's on a different frequency if you if you therefore are going to absorb energy
[2:07:54.560 --> 2:08:01.600]  which is your sustenance then you've got to get that energy on the frequency of radio one
[2:08:01.600 --> 2:08:06.880]  your frequency and and the frequency of these people by their very very nature because our
[2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:13.200]  frequency is dictated by our attitudes and everything um is low vibrational is the same
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:20.960]  frequency range as low vibrational human emotion so the more um that fear anxiety
[2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:28.160]  frustration but anything surrounding death and destruction is generating the very energy
[2:08:28.160 --> 2:08:32.880]  from humanity that you are you are taking your sustenance from this is why they're obsessed
[2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:39.200]  with uh death and everything to do with death to them you see when you pepper bomb triply
[2:08:39.200 --> 2:08:46.080]  you're creating a vast explosion by what you do to those people uh and and and decent people
[2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:51.440]  sure it's blood in the water so they're trying to create death and destruction because that
[2:08:51.440 --> 2:08:59.840]  creates the very energy that they they absorb love appreciation kindness peace these are frequency
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:05.200]  energy frequencies but um they can't access this is why they don't want that in the world
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:11.040]  that's why the television is designed to lower the overall brainwave exactly and and the movies
[2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:17.760]  and all that stuff but in terms of the the the uh the end game what what they are looking for
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:24.640]  is a vastly reduced uh global population vastly reduced um and uh that would be
[2:09:25.760 --> 2:09:33.760]  beyond what we perceive as slaves now they would eventually uh uh be uh manipulated uh
[2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:40.640]  specifically this is in brave new world all the subtly specifically bred to be slaves to have
[2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:45.840]  enough intelligence to to serve as a slave but nothing like enough intelligence to realize that
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:51.920]  their slaves and their in their situation so they would just do it without question they want um a
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:59.760]  network of mind control constant mind control which they're now starting to to to bring in through
[2:09:59.760 --> 2:10:06.320]  these smart grids and these uh lightbulbs these so-called energy saving lightbulbs what they are
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:12.000]  actually it sound crazy but it's not they are transmitters of information and you know i i've
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:18.400]  in my my my new book coming out in january i've i've quoted uh the scientists who and who um
[2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:24.720]  looked into the uh way of transmitting information through the electrical system and they've explained
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:29.440]  what how it's been done through this woodpecker signal that came out of the survey union and
[2:10:29.440 --> 2:10:35.680]  through other means it even with the grid that we have now and what the smart grids are with these
[2:10:35.680 --> 2:10:40.240]  smart meters and i've just come from australia they're kicking up a fuss there they're kicking
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:45.840]  up a fuss about them in um in uh california no no they admit they can cause cancer so they can
[2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:51.200]  beam whatever frequency they want exactly they're in your house and they admit it was on the news
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:56.400]  today even san francisco chronicle the smart meters are can even with an algorithm tell what
[2:10:56.400 --> 2:11:04.080]  you're watching on tv yes exactly and and so what's this smart meter grid this smart grid
[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:09.600]  which they want to connect uh in every country in every country connected to a global network
[2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:16.640]  it is a purpose built uh surveillance operation so that they'd like you quite rightly say can can
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:22.080]  see the fine detail of your lives through the uh communications with the with the the the operating
[2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:27.200]  center but also they admit that by the way they admit they're putting up nationwide street lights
[2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:33.200]  that listen in video tape yeah exactly but the the key thing beyond that is that they will they
[2:11:33.200 --> 2:11:38.640]  they can send information the other way and and through this delivery system which which these
[2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:44.080]  light bulbs are part of a big part of it they're delivering within the frequency range of human
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:52.560]  brain activity um information which which people are designed to uh decode as their own thoughts
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:59.120]  and perceptions to mass mind control operation and so you know there's so many elements to it but
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:05.920]  but what they want is this uh the population human population that comes into this world through
[2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:12.080]  not even procreation as brave new world talks about eventually but through uh you know uh laboratory
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:19.200]  means and where they are produced in batches and and that's why they have to destroy our fertility
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:24.160]  so we have to go to them to have them born in a laboratory where they can then put in the trojan
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:29.200]  horses as they want and you actually get a child that looks like you but it's not even your child
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:35.840]  you can see this program this plan david promise me that before the new book comes out in january
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:41.680]  that you will join us again here on air and and and but but but in closing because i got mike
[2:12:41.680 --> 2:12:46.240]  adams you know waiting to come in here yeah mike's a great guy let me stuff he's awesome but i
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:50.880]  i keep you for 10 hours i would but i uh and i'm sorry that we didn't get your email to earlier
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:55.360]  with the phone number crazy internet stuff but in closing all of this though to give hope
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:03.680]  for my gut is because the system is panicking and they have failed and they're scared well this is
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:10.400]  this is the key point you see um i make the the the very strong difference between what i call
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:17.120]  consciousness which is the infinite eternal self um and what i call mind body which is which is the
[2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:22.080]  interface it's like a computer it's like people say i'm going on the internet but we don't go on
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:28.800]  the internet the computer does and we uh into even if they program us our soul still knows what i'm
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:33.040]  saying what i'm going quickly with this i know you're running out time but uh it's an important
[2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:41.120]  point um you know we go on the internet through the computer now what if the computer um started
[2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:45.040]  becoming detached from us sitting at the keyboard and we were smacking the mouse and
[2:13:45.040 --> 2:13:49.680]  smacking the keyboard and nothing was happening and now the computer is deciding where it's going on
[2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:56.400]  the internet and what he thinks of it that is the dynamic of the human condition the system is
[2:13:56.400 --> 2:14:03.280]  structured to pull us into five sense reality only and then program through eyes and ears information
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:11.600]  which they control our perception of reality what is happening now ah yes is that people are opening
[2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:19.520]  their minds and letting consciousness into that uh perception process and when they do they can see
[2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:24.720]  things suddenly why didn't i see it before it's so obvious well because you you're looking at the
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:28.720]  world from another level of consciousness now this is what's happening this is what they're
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:34.160]  terrified of because they know if enough people do this game over because they can only control us
[2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:38.480]  through body mind they can't control us through consciousness and therefore the more people
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:44.640]  that awaken and my goodness the exponential curve now is extraordinary uh the more this system loses
[2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:51.600]  its grip on human perception it loses its grip on human perception it uses it loses its grip on
[2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:59.200]  on human enslave well that was my final question is that the more they attack us the more we resist
[2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:04.320]  all i see is an awakening and i see the system incredible the number of the people i mean you'll
[2:15:04.320 --> 2:15:09.920]  know this alex i mean people who know this program will know this uh how people now who you just said
[2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:16.240]  never them never her never him never and they're now going hold on a second this just started to
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:23.440]  make sense and you're going not you i mean when people are now awakening who a very short time
[2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:30.160]  ago made would have left this stuff in the face and that that's the the level of uh transformation
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:34.960]  that's now going we've seen nothing yet but of course as this happens the cornered rat is going
[2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:39.600]  to throw everything at us to try to hold on to its power and it's going to be a lot of challenges
[2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:43.840]  and it's going to be a lot of upheaval and and it's going to create as much chaos as it can
[2:15:43.840 --> 2:15:49.840]  so that we get pulled in the five senses of fear and anxiety and oh my god but it it's it's not
[2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:55.600]  but the power to to to ultimately uh provide it's not but it can cause a lot of problems for us as
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:16:00.800]  it already is and that's what the new war is about that's what it's all about yeah what's the name of
[2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:06.640]  the new book coming up uh remember who you are uh you know and it's a multi-point just about that
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:11.200]  one you know thing that comes to mind when you say that it it's it's it's uh that that massive
[2:16:11.200 --> 2:16:16.720]  tapestry of information uh but uh remember who you are yeah you're not Ethel Jones you're not
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:21.600]  Charlie Smith you're not your job you're not your income bracket you're not your color or your race
[2:16:21.600 --> 2:16:26.800]  that's what you're experiencing you are consciousness all powerful infinite eternal
[2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:33.120]  consciousness all that is can be and ever will be and when we we we we move to that perception
[2:16:33.120 --> 2:16:39.520]  of self to that self identity suddenly uh powers little me i just worked down the store
[2:16:39.520 --> 2:16:45.040]  forget it that's an experience is not you are and and and this recognition of our true self and
[2:16:45.040 --> 2:16:49.840]  our true power is what's going to bring this uh house of cards down because the house of cards
[2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:55.360]  is held together by us believing the illusion that we're only little me you know david not only
[2:16:55.360 --> 2:17:01.040]  is the public on fire the general population are waking up i don't think in probably 15 interviews
[2:17:01.600 --> 2:17:06.560]  all right this is a guesstimation i've ever heard you this energized in fact it's painful to even
[2:17:06.560 --> 2:17:10.960]  in this interview with you now because i can't imagine what else you have to say you sound
[2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:17.120]  like you are on fire right now oh yeah i am i am i'm energized you know what it's like you don't
[2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:20.800]  need banging your head against a wall and you you get headache and then suddenly the wall
[2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:27.680]  starts to crumble you think hey i'll bang it's the more now and and to see uh the light go on in so
[2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:33.680]  many people i mean the 2000 people turning up in just one part of australia which has a population
[2:17:33.680 --> 2:17:38.960]  of only 22 million i mean we we're we're there was six other events as well as that and we're
[2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:44.160]  moving and i'm just coming into america i'm talking in cleveland ohio next saturday saturday and then
[2:17:44.160 --> 2:17:48.560]  new york saturday after that sunday after that and i'm looking forward to going to wall street

[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:58.000]  stay in the main show let me put you on hold right now i know ventura's people want to call you right
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:02.160]  now but get you on the show they're they're listening right now and they're about to call
[2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:06.640]  your hotel room there on the other side of the planet in new zealand but uh what about jaren
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:10.880]  emailing you and so we can really have a full discussion this quickening is accelerating how
[2:18:10.880 --> 2:18:16.400]  about you come on when you're here in the us yeah no problem do they go to davidike.com to find tickets
[2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:21.920]  and all that yeah yeah yeah it's uh it's very simple if they go to davidike.com it's all there
[2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:26.400]  yeah but um yeah it's um it's amazing what's happening i like it really is and well well
[2:18:26.400 --> 2:18:29.840]  david i'll say this in closing and i'm gonna go to break and say bye to you during the break
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:34.880]  and then and then mike's gonna uh michael's gonna give you a call uh from a tourist people but
[2:18:36.400 --> 2:18:42.000]  i can feel it i mean whatever it is whether you're right or wrong this is not of this world like the
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:47.920]  devil as christians say whatever there is a system of evil tying things together right you can only
[2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:56.480]  describe as extra ordinary and you know anti-human and uh whatever it is you know some group consciousness
[2:18:56.480 --> 2:19:02.400]  of the psychopaths together whatever it is it's got to be met and i can feel the victory coming
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:08.000]  few of us are well known and actually can be recognized the general public feels like they're
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:12.160]  alone that's the point i made at the start of this interview is that you're known i'm known a few
[2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:17.280]  others are known we see how many people are awake i want folks to take heart and realize
[2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:22.880]  the numbers of awake people is swelling and as you said the cornered rat is going to strike
[2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:29.120]  yes it is but you know it's not going to prevail it's not going to prevail um it's striking out
[2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:34.560]  a panic to a large extent because it's trying to keep the lid on this you know it's no accident but
[2:19:34.560 --> 2:19:39.520]  it's the same time that this awakening is happening it's the same time that they're throwing everything
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:44.480]  they cannot do uh it's because they're trying to keep the lid on this and they can't and therefore
[2:19:44.480 --> 2:19:50.800]  they better get used to it well all i can say is uh excellent job with everything you're doing
[2:19:50.800 --> 2:19:58.880]  david davidike.com again where are you speaking in the u.s uh cleveland hawaii and uh a week uh
[2:19:58.880 --> 2:20:05.200]  saturday um and then new york the following sunday you know i need to get out to one of those
[2:20:05.200 --> 2:20:10.160]  events you know david i still have never met you in person i know come to new york mate
[2:20:11.680 --> 2:20:17.600]  i guess i can let the tsa grab me you know what is that not slave training for these these these
[2:20:17.600 --> 2:20:23.280]  surface to put their hands on us oh yeah i mean i mean all this stuff of you know
[2:20:23.280 --> 2:20:29.040]  the rub down for children and stuff it's preparing children to find that totally acceptable
[2:20:29.040 --> 2:20:33.520]  you know i mean i i've mentioned in the new book you know efforts and you i'm sure you've come
[2:20:33.520 --> 2:20:39.920]  across the efforts to make uh pedophilia and uh you know sex with children to uh acceptable
[2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:45.760]  and and the normal part of stuff and you know what we're seeing uh with the so-called human rights
[2:20:45.760 --> 2:20:51.200]  uh you and human rights of the child and all that stuff it some of it sounds good on the surface
[2:20:51.200 --> 2:20:59.200]  but it's all part of a massive tapestry uh of uh removing um power of the parents over the lives
[2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:04.480]  of the child and so giving it to the state under the illusion of giving it to the child this is
[2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:10.720]  why you know they these horrendous buddy vaccines that they're doing for for girls and um and uh
[2:21:10.720 --> 2:21:17.520]  offering it for kind of getting in for boys now that some uh uh states are or some authorities
[2:21:17.520 --> 2:21:23.520]  are um saying uh that the girl must have the right to decide if they have it not the parents
[2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:30.080]  it's all part of this eroding of parent parental influence uh over their children because the
[2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:37.040]  state wants the kids and brave new world how does it it's all in there well david ike uh
[2:21:37.040 --> 2:21:40.560]  we're going to go to this little promo for the money bomb we're doing right now and i'll say
[2:21:40.560 --> 2:21:45.360]  bye to you uh during this break and then we're going to come back with mike adams the next two
[2:21:45.360 --> 2:21:52.080]  hours the bunch of guests fighting uh against those that wish to uh take people's access to raw milk
[2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:57.600]  but again the the system is scared i mean i mean you agree with that david what's the time frame
[2:21:57.600 --> 2:22:04.000]  until it's clear that these these creatures are being routed yeah that the the greatest fear is
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  is that their um their source of sustenance and source of slavery will be lost and that manifests
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:17.680]  it out in so many different ways it's fear all right i'm gonna have i'm gonna talk to you during
[2:22:17.680 --> 2:22:21.600]  the break i want to set you up right now because i want to do a whole other interview you're on fire

[2:26:57.280 --> 2:27:03.280]  adams the health ranger now we're going to be filling in for the next two hours and thank you
[2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:07.680]  for your patience i was scheduled to jump in about a half an hour ago but of course david
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:12.480]  ike called in and it wasn't that a fascinating interview you know i've i've read all of david
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:19.440]  ike's books and i find him just to be a fascinating person just a tremendous researcher and i hope
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:24.160]  you enjoyed that interview segment some really i mean every time i think i've got things uh sort of
[2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:28.480]  uh at least a little bit figured out out there in the industry what's going on with gmo's what's
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:33.920]  going on with vaccines uh i just opened up david ike's book and then whoa there's a whole another
[2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:39.360]  layer behind that so that was a great interview and thank you for for waiting and thank you for
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:44.400]  your patience now what we have coming up for you in the next few minutes actually over the next hour
[2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:50.960]  or two we've got an interview with pam larry uh coming right up in just a couple of minutes and
[2:27:50.960 --> 2:27:58.480]  she is the woman who began the gmo labeling initiative in california she's the one who
[2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:04.400]  started the whole thing uh really cool uh what a great idea it's really important because california
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:10.400]  can set the precedent that could then just spread across the country and get gmo's labeled on foods
[2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:15.920]  and of course that would very quickly cause people to start avoiding gmo's and that's what we want
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:20.480]  i mean we want choice right we want honesty in the labels so that we can make a choice
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:26.240]  and avoid gmo's if that's what we wish to do and i think most people wish to avoid genetically
[2:28:26.240 --> 2:28:31.120]  modified food so that would be a big deal so we're going to have her on in just probably 60
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:38.240]  seconds or so uh we've also got uh another guest following her rachel patchivas from california
[2:28:38.880 --> 2:28:43.920]  she's also part of the gmo initiative but uh in addition she has some information about
[2:28:43.920 --> 2:28:52.160]  the occupy oakland situation as you know there was there was some violence erupted yesterday
[2:28:52.160 --> 2:28:56.800]  that was covered on drudge report in fact and after that we're going to be talking briefly
[2:28:56.800 --> 2:29:01.360]  if we can get them on michael bedar who was there on the scene and then finally later on
[2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:06.480]  about an hour from now or so robert scott bell will be joining us to give us an update on the raw
[2:29:06.480 --> 2:29:14.640]  milk freedom riders event that just took place a few days ago a couple of days ago where a caravan
[2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:21.520]  of moms drank raw milk in front of the fda in fact they they dipped the cookies in it and they had
[2:29:21.520 --> 2:29:27.680]  raw milk and cookies in front of the fda and the fda responded to that to that with a letter
[2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:32.160]  and we'll be going over the fda's response and what it means it's really quite fascinating and
[2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:38.320]  a good job big shout out to all those wonderful moms who took part in that peaceful protest
[2:29:39.040 --> 2:29:43.360]  yeah they didn't have to fire bullets or anything they just drank raw milk and ate some cookies
[2:29:44.320 --> 2:29:49.520]  what a wonderful message for peace in but also liberty and courage at the same time
[2:29:49.520 --> 2:29:54.320]  now as i promised coming up uh pam larry right here in fact she should be on the phone joining
[2:29:54.320 --> 2:30:00.720]  us to talk about this we've got pam for a about 10 to 15 minutes pam are you on the phone can you
[2:30:00.720 --> 2:30:05.600]  hear me i am and i can hear you how you're doing okay great i'm doing fantastic thank you for joining
[2:30:05.600 --> 2:30:11.600]  us here on the info wars money bomb addition and uh give give people a little bit of background
[2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:18.160]  about this why did you begin the gmo labeling initiative drive the petition drive in california
[2:30:18.800 --> 2:30:24.320]  sure well um i had been studying about genetically engineered foods for about seven eight years and
[2:30:24.320 --> 2:30:29.840]  was getting increasingly depressed about the whole thing and just like looking at the legislative
[2:30:29.840 --> 2:30:36.400]  efforts that never went anywhere and you know petition after online petition yada yada and
[2:30:36.400 --> 2:30:40.640]  finally i mean i was just getting actually quite depressed about it and i just really kind of had
[2:30:40.640 --> 2:30:46.240]  an epiphany one morning a lying in bed in san francisco that it was time for the people of
[2:30:46.240 --> 2:30:51.760]  california to vote on genetically engineered food so that we remember how powerful we are when we
[2:30:51.760 --> 2:30:58.800]  take back our food so that's how it started and uh that that was on january 20th oh okay so january
[2:30:58.800 --> 2:31:04.720]  20th but since then you've had all kinds of support not just support in the press tell us about that
[2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:12.000]  and the financial support too sure so um i we i took about six weeks to learn how to do an initiative
[2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:17.520]  got a website up made a facebook page and just kind of started reaching out started down in
[2:31:17.520 --> 2:31:22.800]  southern california because that's where the most population is went to small meetings people came on
[2:31:22.800 --> 2:31:29.520]  board so they leave their communities and slowly it just started the snowball um and then uh late
[2:31:30.240 --> 2:31:36.640]  in june i got contacted by dr bronner's magical felt david bronner i can talk about this now because
[2:31:36.640 --> 2:31:41.600]  they've wanted to keep a lot of this under wraps for a long time um and he said that they wanted
[2:31:41.600 --> 2:31:46.720]  to get involved and do a feasibility study so that was done the survey was done all sorts of great
[2:31:46.720 --> 2:31:52.560]  stuff was done and um just more and more people we've got other organizations the organic
[2:31:52.560 --> 2:31:59.760]  consumer association has always been supportive jeffrey smith is supportive um center food safety
[2:32:00.560 --> 2:32:06.960]  uh let me see gosh there's food democracy now we've got different businesses on board now nature's
[2:32:06.960 --> 2:32:13.520]  path marcolla you guys also it's just amazing what's happening and exploding yeah it's across the
[2:32:13.520 --> 2:32:17.440]  industry i mean you what the names you just named there that's that's across the industry there's
[2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:22.480]  it's really a coalition you might say of all these groups the publishers the the serial company you
[2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:27.040]  mentioned nature's path the organic consumers association and this crosses all political lines
[2:32:27.040 --> 2:32:31.360]  it's it's left right it's libertarian it's conservative it's everything it's independent exactly
[2:32:31.360 --> 2:32:35.760]  but isn't it wonderful that it has come to this now but you've got all that all that support what
[2:32:35.760 --> 2:32:41.120]  about the opposition what are you now anticipating well we're anticipating quite a bit of opposition
[2:32:41.120 --> 2:32:46.880]  actually i mean that's pretty much a no-brainer um you know they have started with some blogs already
[2:32:46.880 --> 2:32:52.800]  you know you know totally misrepresenting the issues you know that we've been had this for
[2:32:52.800 --> 2:32:59.120]  two thousand years blah blah blah you know the health story um they've been you know pooping it as
[2:32:59.120 --> 2:33:05.440]  we're luddites you know all that kind of stuff or that it's a crazy california thing but you know
[2:33:05.440 --> 2:33:11.520]  and we anticipate that the mud flinging will get you know increase and get worse um you know because
[2:33:11.520 --> 2:33:15.120]  that's what you do when you're trying to hold on to something that you know is a lose it you know
[2:33:15.120 --> 2:33:18.720]  it's a losing proposition well at least if they're going to be uh if you're going to have integrity
[2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:24.560]  they should sling genetically modified mud and not just the regular earth mud um you know i mean
[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:29.600]  come on people what they're saying we're luddites because we don't want to have our food engineered
[2:33:29.600 --> 2:33:34.480]  by a bunch of evil scientists that's that seems strange yeah and one of our things is that if
[2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:38.800]  they're so wonderful why not label them because you should be advertising and want them labeled
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:45.440]  yeah that's a good point it should say now featuring extra gmo's right on the package yeah yeah that's
[2:33:45.440 --> 2:33:50.960]  pretty cool yeah but just the ground for support has been amazing i mean we started with one percent
[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:55.920]  on march 10th we now on a grassroots level have over a hundred leaders throughout the state
[2:33:55.920 --> 2:34:01.600]  organizing their communities going to events showing movies having tabling you know information
[2:34:01.600 --> 2:34:06.480]  to give out we're gearing up for signature gathering which should start soon uh you know
[2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:11.760]  having training about that you can visit our website is at label gmo's dot org wait a minute
[2:34:11.760 --> 2:34:19.200]  what was the site again i didn't get that label gmo's dot org okay label gmo's dot org yeah and
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:25.200]  we have our different events that's the official grassroots campaign site and um we have uh our
[2:34:25.200 --> 2:34:31.360]  events up there on there for people throughout the state to um to join us we're inviting everybody i
[2:34:31.360 --> 2:34:37.680]  mean this is going to take i as i call it not just a large village but a large universe yeah to get
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:44.720]  to get voted in on groups large and small individuals companies organizations we're gonna come together
[2:34:44.720 --> 2:34:49.200]  because this is big yeah it is big and we are coming together and one of the things that's really
[2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:54.800]  cool about that is here at info wars uh alex jones has been covering this issue giving it a lot of
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:35:01.520]  coverage he he gets it he recognizes the threat that this is to our food to our fertility him and
[2:35:01.520 --> 2:35:06.320]  he was just interviewing david wolf uh i'm sorry david ike excuse me uh i was i was talking to
[2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:11.280]  david earlier he was just interviewing david ike about genetics and the future of the of the human
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:17.120]  race and so he's on board with it info wars is on board with it and and and now you've got this
[2:35:17.120 --> 2:35:22.640]  petition coming in it's it's really incredible can you uh can you talk about the importance of now
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:29.920]  using this petition to bypass uh congress in in a sense we're bypassing the politicians with this
[2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:35.520]  yeah yes so you know there are certain things that we have to be really sure that we cover because
[2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:41.040]  you know labeling food is something that happens all around the country you know not just in the
[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:46.800]  state of california so people often have questions about that it's called preemption um you know but
[2:35:46.800 --> 2:35:51.760]  we've got that covered we we believe that we have a right in california to have labeling that super
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:58.960]  teed any uh policy not regulation because labeling is not regulated it's a policy um we feel that we've
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:05.920]  got really great uh legal arguments to counter any kind of challenge or you know or anything that
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:11.760]  might come up against it once it's voted in um we've had an amazing team working on this and it's
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:17.360]  it's really pretty monumental i mean this will change the course of food history in this country
[2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:22.080]  absolutely it will change the course of food history and it's going to be really interesting
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:27.760]  to see what kind of arguments they come out with to uh to to fight this uh all kinds of
[2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:33.360]  scare campaigns but really uh if people had an accurate assessment of what to what is safe versus
[2:36:33.360 --> 2:36:39.200]  what is scary you know what's safe is non genetically modified food and what is scary is this playing
[2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:45.200]  god with the genes and you know putting putting spider genes in plants and putting uh animal
[2:36:45.200 --> 2:36:50.640]  genes in plants and pesticide genes and plants what what could be more frightening than that
[2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:56.000]  especially if you understand anything about science really and and the the neat part is
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:02.240]  is that we're really focusing on our right to know and you know we um no matter what where you
[2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:07.280]  come down i mean there even though quite a few people who are pro gmo who are also pro labeling
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:12.000]  because you know at one of our other things is you know farmers right to grow our right to know
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:17.200]  because that's the way that the law reads right now is that people can plant this stuff but we're
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:22.880]  saying okay fine you know the law supports you in doing that well we we believe that you know
[2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:28.800]  informed consumer rights should supersede corporate uh you know in the non-transparent profit
[2:37:29.440 --> 2:37:34.480]  you know their ability to make money by hiding things from us yeah there's there's a lot of
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:39.200]  money that has been made by hiding things from people um now we've got rachel pachivas coming
[2:37:39.200 --> 2:37:43.360]  on in just a couple of minutes following uh following you here pam uh and by the way i
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:48.320]  want to say even even before recently i wasn't aware that you were the person who started this
[2:37:48.320 --> 2:37:54.240]  petition so uh kudos to you and i think you deserve tremendous credit oh thank you very much
[2:37:54.240 --> 2:37:59.200]  you know but it if it just stayed me it wouldn't be going anywhere it's like you know i was kind
[2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:03.760]  of like the spark and everybody kind of went yeah good idea and so everyone's coming on board and
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:08.240]  it's been really really great yeah large and small yeah if you think about it you you were a great
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:14.080]  example of being an effective what we might call here an info warrior because i don't know if you use
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:19.760]  that metaphor maybe you're an info educator whatever you metaphor you use but uh this shows the power
[2:38:19.760 --> 2:38:25.680]  of one individual to initiate to catalyze change that can change the world yeah and it's just one
[2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:30.640]  of the things is i just just keep going you just keep going because a lot of times i mean i didn't
[2:38:30.640 --> 2:38:35.520]  know where this is going to end up i had no idea you know but you know when you want you feel the
[2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:39.920]  call you just got to keep going and that's the advice that i give folks if you have you know

[2:38:49.920 --> 2:38:54.640]  sense people start going yeah yeah this sounds like a good idea we could do this you know we've
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:38:59.600]  got a few people that were you know pretty adamantly against us when we started you know within the
[2:38:59.600 --> 2:39:04.160]  industry because they were afraid and now they're on board i mean it's just been amazing to watch
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:09.920]  yeah but yeah my main message is to be any kind of a peaceful warrior it's just to keep going

[2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:27.280]  there uh in oakland with gmo's with the gmo petition but also with some of what you observed
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:32.720]  over the last couple of days with the occupy protest yeah so i went the other night tuesday
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:38.800]  night i have some friends who have a traveling t-bus and we just pulled up and we started serving
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:44.880]  t to everyone and everyone was just really really open and everyone was really welcoming and it was
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:49.760]  really nice to see such an eclectic group and there's just people of all different kinds
[2:41:49.760 --> 2:41:54.080]  hanging out sitting in circles drinking tea together so it was it was really eye-opening
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:59.760]  to see all of it and it isn't something so amazing so you know i'm back you're you get a good a good
[2:41:59.760 --> 2:42:05.760]  feeling of community involvement there and a lot of people peacefully working in in a common
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:10.480]  direction is that kind of the takeaway that was your experience yes it was so amazing like one of
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:14.960]  my girlfriends and i were walking through and there's there's a tent for a library in a media
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:19.920]  center in a prayer center there's a children's tent there is meditation and grounding there was a
[2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:25.440]  garden there was like a kitchen and sanitary and composting and recycling and everyone everyone's
[2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:30.160]  thanking everyone all the time and just really appreciating everyone who's there um and they're
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:34.320]  just such lovely people and you see stuff on on the tv and youtube and everything and you're not
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:39.120]  really sure what their goal is and what everything's going on but when you go there and you talk to
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:45.440]  people all they want is equality you know all everyone wants is to be the same as everyone
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:49.520]  else you should see one with everyone and it was really really nice to be a part of it for a few
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:56.240]  hours well um but there was some violence reported there uh that there let's see the report
[2:42:56.240 --> 2:43:02.400]  city officials said that there were protesters hurling rocks explosives bottles i mean these are
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:07.680]  their own words but that apparently that was a completely different group did you uh did you
[2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:12.800]  see that group did you have any knowledge of that group you know what i experienced is nothing like
[2:43:12.800 --> 2:43:17.920]  that and i spoke with a few people who were realized by the police and they were saying how they feel
[2:43:17.920 --> 2:43:22.880]  the police is hiring people to come in and start arguments and start mayhem and chaos going on in
[2:43:22.880 --> 2:43:28.080]  the camp and uh what i experienced were just everyone everyone is helping everyone and there's
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:32.240]  a few people in the outskirts who kind of just hang out and they're not really a part of it
[2:43:32.240 --> 2:43:36.640]  but those people kind of they they go away because they feel that that's not what is going on there
[2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:41.040]  and the people that are there for the right reasons are all working together and they're
[2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:45.520]  working at you know it's nine o'clock ten o'clock at night they were nailing in garden beds and
[2:43:45.520 --> 2:43:51.360]  creating bins and organizing for compost and creating an altar that's the the general reason
[2:43:51.360 --> 2:43:57.120]  i went there was because i wanted to have some gmo info on one of the altars there one of our
[2:43:57.120 --> 2:44:01.360]  volunteers mentioned to me that they're creating an altar and she's also have some gmo's there
[2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:06.160]  well i'm curious i mean an altar what what what kind of altar what what what symbols were being
[2:44:06.160 --> 2:44:11.840]  used there what was it being what was the you know there were there were peace signs there were flowers
[2:44:11.840 --> 2:44:18.080]  there was the american flag there were people holding hands there was just people loving people
[2:44:18.080 --> 2:44:23.840]  pretty much is what i can say just all these different movements had little fires at the altar
[2:44:23.840 --> 2:44:30.800]  um just everyone of small small uh quantity was recognized at this altar that usually isn't
[2:44:30.800 --> 2:44:36.080]  recognized wow very interesting what uh what about you said uh you were aware of some people being
[2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:41.120]  brutalized by police was that something you saw yourself or was that something you heard
[2:44:41.840 --> 2:44:46.480]  something i heard he was sitting in the t-bus with us at one point of the night we were sitting in
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:51.600]  the t-bus all kind of telling stories and he was talking about how he was just taken and handcuffed
[2:44:51.600 --> 2:44:56.640]  and thrown into the back of the car it was completely black and pitch black and dark and he
[2:44:56.640 --> 2:45:02.000]  was scared and he had no idea why he was being arrested and i didn't really get into the full
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:06.320]  conversation with us because with him because i was serving tea but it it sounded awful it's not
[2:45:06.320 --> 2:45:11.680]  a ridiculous but that's actually going on and you wonder why why is it happening why does this
[2:45:11.680 --> 2:45:16.960]  happen you know do you do you believe as a person who has been there on the scene on the front lines
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:22.880]  talking with the people you've been part of these groups the drinking of tea the uh the the holding
[2:45:22.880 --> 2:45:27.840]  hands these kinds of things do you think that the the acts of violence that were going on or the
[2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:34.080]  police brutality are these things that are being injected into the group from outside forces is
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:38.960]  this something that's being engineered do you have any sense of definitely they they are not violent
[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:43.680]  people i did not get any anywhere else i wouldn't have been there i don't like to be in violent places
[2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:47.680]  i don't like to be around people like that and immediately when i went there people are like
[2:45:47.680 --> 2:45:52.320]  hey who are you we told him we're serving dinner like welcome you hang out hang out with us you
[2:45:52.320 --> 2:45:56.400]  know and i told him i'm with label cmo's and i wanted to let them know about our initiative
[2:45:56.400 --> 2:46:01.520]  campaign they're like yeah we're with us in five months and so and every everyone's really open
[2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:06.400]  to everything and loving people everywhere where i was and i was looking confused because i wanted
[2:46:06.400 --> 2:46:10.640]  to know something someone's like hey what can i help you with you know what what happened at at
[2:46:10.640 --> 2:46:15.200]  Whole Foods what was that all about there was the Whole Foods store i heard was uh the the doors were
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:23.280]  smashed in by some group i heard about that i was not there i i heard that doors were smashed in but
[2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:28.080]  i i was not there i don't know what happened well see it didn't see that to me that's a sign that
[2:46:28.080 --> 2:46:32.880]  this doesn't make sense the group that you're talking about the peace altar people they would
[2:46:32.880 --> 2:46:37.600]  never smash down the doors of a Whole Foods it seems you know what kind of a group would
[2:46:37.600 --> 2:46:43.120]  would attack the Whole Foods front doors that's you know i don't yeah i don't i don't know if
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:47.680]  there's different groups going on here or if there's you know something may have happened
[2:46:47.680 --> 2:46:52.880]  where they did something to them and they're just retaliating you know i'm not really sure but
[2:46:52.880 --> 2:46:57.760]  definitely the people i saw were just inspiring and they were all prepping for their their march
[2:46:57.760 --> 2:47:02.240]  on the following day on Wednesday the second all right so so rachel one of the things that you
[2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:06.160]  were doing there was helping to spread the word about gmo's and were you were you getting signatures
[2:47:06.160 --> 2:47:10.480]  for the gmo uh labeling initiative i was not i was not we're not yet in the signature gathering
[2:47:10.480 --> 2:47:15.440]  process okay so waiting till the end of december so right now we're just i mean we're recruiting
[2:47:15.440 --> 2:47:22.240]  pledges and and volunteers but i just wanted to get an idea of what everyone was doing and the key
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:27.680]  message that we're trying to get across here with labeled gmo's is that we support occupy oakland and
[2:47:27.680 --> 2:47:33.280]  we support all of the occupies and we're all in this together we want truth as labeled gmo's because
[2:47:33.280 --> 2:47:41.360]  we deserve the right to know as human beings and we want justice and we want equality so well i mean
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:47.280]  gosh you you can only be on i know for another few minutes um but those some of those are tricky
[2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:52.800]  terms i mean obviously we want justice but when you start saying we want equality uh i think it
[2:47:52.800 --> 2:47:58.080]  sort of depends on your interpretation of that like we don't want to force everybody to be the same
[2:47:58.080 --> 2:48:03.040]  we want to respect individuality right but we want to give everybody an equal opportunity
[2:48:03.040 --> 2:48:09.040]  to express who they are that is that what you're saying absolutely and we uh with equality i mean
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:16.880]  that uh i hope i don't get in trouble here that politicians they we want the same as like we all
[2:48:16.880 --> 2:48:21.520]  deserve the same you know what i mean we're we're all people we're all people on the first together
[2:48:21.520 --> 2:48:26.720]  and um one of the things that i was also hearing about was how the mayor of oakland went out and
[2:48:26.720 --> 2:48:32.000]  she wanted to speak and some of the key people in the occupy camp they're like you know she can speak
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:36.720]  but she's gonna wait in line like everybody else because we're all the same and police can come
[2:48:36.720 --> 2:48:41.200]  here and hang out and participate but they're not gonna wear their uniform they're not going to
[2:48:41.200 --> 2:48:46.400]  inflict this this fear you know and everyone's the same and you have to treat it like that and
[2:48:46.400 --> 2:48:52.160]  that's what i think of when i think of equality yeah some really good some really good points and
[2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:57.760]  a lot of this of course up for discussion and being discussed as uh on a national scale with all of
[2:48:57.760 --> 2:49:03.840]  these occupy protests um i'm i'm really glad that a lot of these issues are coming to the forefront
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:09.040]  and being talked about and because really if you look at the gmo issue rachel uh the gmo issue is
[2:49:09.040 --> 2:49:13.520]  about transparency it's really about corporate transparency right let's know what's in our
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:18.800]  food what if we had corporate transparency with a federal reserve too like let's know what's in our
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:24.640]  money so to speak absolutely yeah do you find a lot of resonance with that kind of issue uh with
[2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:29.760]  the people that you've been hanging out with too do they talk about the fed i haven't heard much about
[2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:34.640]  it but i'm sure that it's you know in the back of their minds and they they think about it and
[2:49:34.640 --> 2:49:38.800]  i think it kind of correlates with everything that's going on all of the occupies you know all over
[2:49:38.800 --> 2:49:44.480]  the country and that's kind of where it all stems from it stems from corporate power and it's just
[2:49:44.480 --> 2:49:48.720]  not okay and people are finally standing up to it and finally doing something about it yeah isn't
[2:49:48.720 --> 2:49:54.400]  that fascinating the corporate power has infiltrated every little corner of society it's infiltrated
[2:49:54.400 --> 2:50:00.560]  politics it's infiltrated food and farming it's infiltrated medicine it is infiltrated war i mean
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:05.760]  war what is war but really an excuse to funnel more money to more corporations that are building
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:12.160]  more bombs and making more bullets and then causing more war absolutely it it's insane it's
[2:50:12.160 --> 2:50:17.440]  ridiculous it's awful it's so sad and it's like you want to sit here and you want to be happy that
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:22.320]  you're living in a great country and it's amazing but there's all this craziness going on and you
[2:50:22.320 --> 2:50:28.320]  wonder why is this happening and why don't people do something and occupy occupy everything they're
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:32.800]  all starting to do something some people you know i i have conversations with co-workers and people
[2:50:32.800 --> 2:50:35.680]  that i see on the streets and they're like you know they don't really want anything what are they
[2:50:35.680 --> 2:50:39.600]  working for what is their goal and i actually had that view in the beginning i was like well what are
[2:50:39.600 --> 2:50:45.680]  they doing but you think about it and it takes it takes a while for a group of people with so much
[2:50:46.560 --> 2:50:51.360]  uh motivation and so much hype to actually find a common goal and like to think about
[2:50:51.360 --> 2:50:56.080]  about everyone having one little goal and how they all kind of have this correlation with
[2:50:56.080 --> 2:51:02.320]  each other that's the goal you know that there's all these different requests yeah well i gotta
[2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:07.520]  admit too some of some of the actions are a little i'm not sure where they're going with it for
[2:51:07.520 --> 2:51:13.440]  example blocking the port how i mean i understand blocking the port maybe a statement against some
[2:51:13.440 --> 2:51:20.240]  corporations but you know import and export is crucial to national trade you know ultimately i
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:24.560]  would hope these people don't want to block the port forever it's sort of just a symbolic thing
[2:51:24.560 --> 2:51:29.520]  why would they block a port i think so i think it's just a temporary thing you know i think they
[2:51:29.520 --> 2:51:35.120]  say they need to see that it's people who are creating this cost creating this be possible
[2:51:35.120 --> 2:51:38.880]  you know what it means so if they don't if you don't have your people with you you don't have it
[2:51:38.880 --> 2:51:44.160]  yeah and corporations start to have to have to realize that because we we are the power
[2:51:44.160 --> 2:51:52.160]  well you know folks the easiest way to block the port is just buy american by local organic
[2:51:52.160 --> 2:51:56.560]  right right buy local buy your food from your local farmers you don't you don't need to get
[2:51:56.560 --> 2:52:01.600]  your food imported on a ship from china now i see you've only got a couple of minutes left left
[2:52:01.600 --> 2:52:05.760]  three minutes left rachel uh what what other thoughts you think are important from what you
[2:52:05.760 --> 2:52:12.480]  observed there on the scenes in oakland yesterday in the day before you know um i would say like
[2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:16.960]  i actually want to go down there one day on my day off and just contribute a few hours and help
[2:52:16.960 --> 2:52:21.200]  out just be a part of the community because it's not scary and like i talked to my dad and he's
[2:52:21.200 --> 2:52:25.040]  like oh you know it's kind of scary be careful it's dangerous and i went down there it wasn't
[2:52:25.040 --> 2:52:30.320]  dangerous it was so peaceful it was so calm it was people working together and it felt so good it
[2:52:30.320 --> 2:52:34.560]  felt like that's what life should be about um as long as the police aren't there hurting people
[2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:39.360]  but it wasn't dangerous but you know if someone wants to go down there you don't have to sleep
[2:52:39.360 --> 2:52:44.240]  there you don't have to camp out and get a tent just go down there and help out and contribute and
[2:52:44.240 --> 2:52:49.360]  see what you can do uh just for a few hours you know whatever you can do will help them and that
[2:52:49.360 --> 2:52:54.720]  was something it'll be real interesting to see where this goes rachel do you do you have a blog

[3:00:56.000 --> 3:01:01.280]  it's really fascinating this is a this is a fantastic crew and oh and by the way uh what a
[3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:05.680]  funny video there of alex i hadn't seen some of that footage and if you're looking if you're
[3:01:05.680 --> 3:01:10.320]  seeing that for the first time you might think wow that that looks pretty wild uh well it is called
[3:01:10.320 --> 3:01:16.080]  crazy like alex jones it's sort of a fun a fun look at the highlights of some of the craziest
[3:01:16.080 --> 3:01:20.720]  most hilarious stuff that he's done over the years but behind the scenes alex jones is a very
[3:01:20.720 --> 3:01:27.280]  authentic very genuine person uh in fact he was um and he's very he's actually very humble behind
[3:01:27.280 --> 3:01:32.320]  the scenes he was he was over here apologizing to me for the delay in having me on uh because
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:36.720]  david i called in and i said you know alex don't worry about it you know this is a dynamic thing
[3:01:36.720 --> 3:01:42.560]  it's things are flowing things are shifting here all the time that's that's live broadcast it's live
[3:01:42.560 --> 3:01:49.200]  live radio live internet that's what happens so don't worry about it and um i i'd brought in uh on
[3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:53.200]  another topic i've brought in some um juicing equipment today i already showed you the big
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:01:59.520]  bag of carrots over here 15 pounds of carrots okay one more shot this is still going to be
[3:01:59.520 --> 3:02:05.280]  juiced tonight we also brought in a bunch of organic apples organic celery and parsley and we've been
[3:02:05.280 --> 3:02:11.040]  working uh the the juicing machine over there to get everybody some juice yeah there we go nice
[3:02:11.040 --> 3:02:16.000]  nice big shot of it this is this is info wars power right here because uh the reason i did this
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:21.280]  is it i don't even know it just the idea just came like hey let's let's make some juice for
[3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:25.520]  everybody give everybody some good nutrition on that day because people are going to be up
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:30.960]  24 hours or even longer uh and they're going to need some good nutrition to get through that
[3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:37.360]  more than just the usual hit of coffee and everybody here behind the scenes is really
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:42.160]  interested in health and nutrition it's one of the fascinating things about info wars for example
[3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:47.920]  every time that i come here people walk up to me here uh staff members and they ask me questions
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:51.920]  about health in fact um one of the guys here today was just asking me what do you think about the
[3:02:51.920 --> 3:02:57.440]  paleolithic diet and i said yeah that's that's that's really good because it's it's all about no
[3:02:57.440 --> 3:03:02.880]  processed food it's all about getting back to the basics of where we came from as human beings
[3:03:02.880 --> 3:03:07.680]  you know get if we if we could rewind our food a couple hundred years we would be a lot healthier
[3:03:07.680 --> 3:03:12.880]  other people ask me about uh sometimes food allergies or recipes for different kinds of
[3:03:12.880 --> 3:03:17.200]  things so i'm always chatting with the crew here they're really open to being super healthy and
[3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:22.720]  improving their health and then sometimes i come in and jaren's got like two dozen donuts just sitting
[3:03:22.720 --> 3:03:31.040]  there on his desk with the orange sparkles uh the the sprinkles on him and i i just i just look
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:37.120]  at him i say jaren man look at that two dozen donuts he says no mike no the orange sprinkles
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:43.520]  that's vitamin c right there right there for you see clever um clever nutritional knowledge
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:47.840]  no the uh these guys jaren and the and the rest of the crew they have their own little scene going
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:54.000]  on back here behind behind the glass behind the camera behind what you're seeing and uh it is so
[3:03:54.560 --> 3:04:00.560]  hilarious to stand there and watch what they do watch these guys because they're they're super
[3:04:00.560 --> 3:04:05.760]  sharp they have a great sense of humor and they they joke about all kinds of things i said you
[3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:11.120]  know you should put a camera in that room and simul broadcast that as a whole separate show
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:15.920]  that would be a big hit but then of course they probably wouldn't be as funny because some of
[3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:21.760]  it's not uh maybe maybe you wouldn't want to air some of that but it is it is very entertaining
[3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:26.080]  and the guys really really know what they're doing here so it's a great crew uh one of the
[3:04:26.080 --> 3:04:30.480]  other behind the scenes things that's going on here is if you walk around the info wars studios
[3:04:30.480 --> 3:04:36.480]  right now you start noticing that people are rolling out uh camping a gear like sleeping bags
[3:04:37.200 --> 3:04:43.120]  things like that hammocks um i have a feeling that in another what six or eight hours maybe
[3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:50.320]  10 hours this is going to be uh a sleep in it's going to be like occupy info wars around here
[3:04:50.320 --> 3:04:53.600]  we're going to probably turn over turn a corner there's going to be some homeless guy sleeping
[3:04:53.600 --> 3:04:59.440]  there for all we know no i i kid but uh the people are really in here they're really committed
[3:04:59.440 --> 3:05:05.520]  for the long haul and uh you can help support them by going to info wars money bomb dot com

[3:05:19.600 --> 3:05:26.240]  we have another guest coming right up uh michael baydar is on the phone with us and michael baydar
[3:05:26.240 --> 3:05:32.880]  is uh he's he he worked with dr. gabriel cousins at the tree of life rejuvenation center and he's
[3:05:32.880 --> 3:05:37.680]  in all kinds of interesting things including uh including healthy living uh raw foods things
[3:05:37.680 --> 3:05:42.400]  like that but the reason he's joining us today is to talk about the occupy oakland situation
[3:05:42.400 --> 3:05:47.680]  from a slightly different perspective as what you just heard in the previous segment uh so
[3:05:47.680 --> 3:05:54.320]  michael baydar are you with us i guess i am i'm doing great michael thanks for joining us on on
[3:05:54.320 --> 3:06:02.720]  the phone uh now here yeah thanks thanks you're you're you're now a a um an info warrior uh here
[3:06:02.720 --> 3:06:07.040]  on info wars money bomb so what did you see yesterday going on weren't you there at the
[3:06:07.040 --> 3:06:13.440]  whole foods when some of that scene was happening well i was it was really um first i was just there
[3:06:13.440 --> 3:06:18.960]  shopping and i actually you know prefer to shop at the local farmers market on grand lake avenue
[3:06:18.960 --> 3:06:25.200]  here on saturdays and the the oakland div farmers market on sundays everyone should know about that
[3:06:25.200 --> 3:06:33.680]  um the fat beats farmers market phat p-e-e-e-t-s farmers market okay i was shopping at whole foods
[3:06:33.680 --> 3:06:41.520]  um sometimes i shopped there and um i was getting some organic oranges and i i just walked out
[3:06:41.520 --> 3:06:47.120]  into the front of the store after i passed the cashier and i had thought maybe i'd walk just
[3:06:47.120 --> 3:06:51.920]  to see what was happening at occupied oakland while that energy is happening here kind of the
[3:06:51.920 --> 3:06:56.720]  quickening that david ike and alex were talking about kind of a lot happening at the same time so
[3:06:56.720 --> 3:07:03.840]  but before i could even start walking down towards where i thought the main protests were um i heard
[3:07:03.840 --> 3:07:11.120]  some loud sounds and i turned and then there was um i'm probably small but you know a significant
[3:07:11.120 --> 3:07:19.120]  crowd of people um coming over um and mostly dressed in black and some masks and hiding their identity
[3:07:19.120 --> 3:07:24.640]  and wait wait wait a minute uh describe more i'm sorry michael didn't mean to interrupt but
[3:07:24.640 --> 3:07:31.200]  you said they're dressed in black and wearing masks yes what what did i mean did it look like
[3:07:31.760 --> 3:07:38.240]  uh hoodies or sweatshirts or was it uniforms i mean what what kind of black uh dress were were
[3:07:38.240 --> 3:07:47.600]  they wearing there um well uh it's it's i guess i mean i mean their actions are a lot more than
[3:07:47.600 --> 3:07:54.640]  their clothing okay i i guess i mean i guess it's the the style of the people that kind of unite
[3:07:54.640 --> 3:07:59.360]  to do these kinds of actions and they're um i'm sure they're a small number because they were
[3:07:59.360 --> 3:08:03.760]  far fewer than the thousands that were rallying in the peaceful way that rachel was talking about
[3:08:03.760 --> 3:08:09.120]  but it's odd i mean a group of people dressed in black wearing masks just assaulting our whole
[3:08:09.120 --> 3:08:13.920]  foods i mean they're a map they're a map kind of like covered up the nose and down kind of
[3:08:13.920 --> 3:08:20.240]  they wrapped a black kind of sweater around their face until they were so i'm not sure what the goal
[3:08:20.240 --> 3:08:27.440]  is i mean they're so immature to not be seen i think maturity is like having mutuality and
[3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:33.360]  respect and constructive relationships to go on another and i feel like these people i didn't
[3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:41.280]  sense any maturity from them but what did they do what were their actions michael well um baby
[3:08:41.280 --> 3:08:47.040]  here's what i saw keeping in the little fence that had separated the sort of outdoor eating
[3:08:47.040 --> 3:08:53.360]  cafe at the whole food from the sidewalk kicked in that fence then started kind of
[3:08:54.560 --> 3:09:00.720]  tossing buckets of paint at the windows and walls of the outside of the whole food and then
[3:09:00.720 --> 3:09:05.600]  hitting the windows and throwing the tables and chairs from that little outdoor cafe at
[3:09:05.600 --> 3:09:12.480]  the whole food you know glass front and shattered one of them um this left the security of whole
[3:09:12.480 --> 3:09:20.320]  foods inside closing the door shutting it down and um keeping customers inside who were there for
[3:09:20.320 --> 3:09:26.880]  about 20 minutes inside and couldn't leave the whole food trapped in whole foods right it's like
[3:09:26.880 --> 3:09:32.800]  it's like a cheap horror film all right so so they were they were smashing in the windows i mean
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:36.720]  it's not i don't know why i'm laughing i mean it's it's a little it's very strange that this was
[3:09:36.720 --> 3:09:41.840]  going on number one why would they target whole foods why would they wear uh wear masks i mean
[3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:46.400]  whole food seems like it's the place where a lot of the people who are protesting would be customers
[3:09:46.400 --> 3:09:52.560]  why would they target whole foods why wouldn't they go attack of a bank or something i don't think
[3:09:52.560 --> 3:09:57.120]  we can connect the people that were mainly marching and rallying and protesting with these
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:00.720]  individuals i don't think they have the same philosophy i don't think they have i think this
[3:10:00.720 --> 3:10:06.560]  was very opportunistic because it's just not what i've seen on tv and any others to use occupied
[3:10:06.560 --> 3:10:15.760]  protest yeah and um i don't believe they share the respect for life and um it's respect for one
[3:10:15.760 --> 3:10:21.280]  another that the whole occupied process needs to be based on did you get any sense of how old this
[3:10:21.280 --> 3:10:25.600]  the members of this group were where they did they look like teenagers you know in the way they
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:32.080]  moved in the way they walked or did they look older i'd say teenagers maybe like early 20s at the
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:37.920]  most i mean that's what i sense like like like rebellious college students or high school dropout
[3:10:37.920 --> 3:10:43.600]  there okay so maybe some of what we saw in in london a few months ago with the the uk riots
[3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:48.480]  and the burning of their own city is that did it seem like it was just an expression of uh
[3:10:48.480 --> 3:10:55.200]  destructive outrage yeah that's a far better comparison yeah wow well that's really weird
[3:10:55.200 --> 3:10:59.840]  i mean you so you got this one group that's that's setting up an altar and drinking tea and they've
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:04.160]  got peace signs and all this and then you have this other group of kids wearing black and black
[3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:10.960]  masks that are bashing in the windows at at Whole Foods uh was there were there any police there
[3:11:10.960 --> 3:11:17.040]  what happened next well there were police until way later i i actually stayed around
[3:11:17.040 --> 3:11:25.040]  to actually i did some other news interviews um i did these news interviews and um the police
[3:11:25.040 --> 3:11:32.400]  eventually came um to investigate uh kind of get evidence you know see what they could get i thought
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:36.000]  it was weird that there were no police there the whole thing was quite sounds like felt like a mob
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:41.760]  i was i actually backed away away when i saw what was going to happen because it was a little bit
[3:11:41.760 --> 3:11:48.880]  startling and the police might have um you did there's a purpose there yeah that does seem odd
[3:11:48.880 --> 3:11:52.720]  i mean you do have a bag of oranges though you could have started to throw those uh in your
[3:11:52.720 --> 3:11:58.560]  defense you're armed with oranges in in oakland organic oranges hit them upside the head with
[3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:03.840]  some non-gmo oranges that might that might knock some sense into them huh yeah armed with oranges
[3:12:03.840 --> 3:12:09.760]  at least it's a liberation yeah yeah indeed that's what we got to do is it's like a food fight now
[3:12:09.760 --> 3:12:14.000]  they they smash on a window you hit them with some celery bunches right over the head so
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:18.960]  you know that way you're stalking them you see how that works oh right cheap humor okay sorry about
[3:12:18.960 --> 3:12:24.400]  that yeah i know a lot of even even amongst the small groups some people try to stop them from
[3:12:24.400 --> 3:12:30.800]  being so distracted so i think i don't know maybe maybe we need a lot better way to channel
[3:12:31.840 --> 3:12:38.240]  energy that young people have i mean just just uh i don't know yeah well yeah it does it does seem
[3:12:38.240 --> 3:12:44.400]  very odd and and you may not like this comment but um um yeah all you need to stop that is one uh one
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:50.080]  whole foods employee with a pack and a concealed weapon that would take care of the whole thing
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:56.080]  right there i know that's not that's not the oakland way to address issues but uh since i'm
[3:12:56.080 --> 3:13:01.280]  talking to you from texas that's that's the texas way to address uh uh violence but um
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:06.880]  obviously none of us want to promote violence so i sort of say that in jest but so uh where do you
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:14.800]  think this is all heading though in oakland michael well um kind of like death and taxes i don't think
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:18.960]  this small group of they wrote this anarchy symbol on the whole foods too i don't think they're
[3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:24.720]  gonna go anywhere so it's like i think i focus my energy on what's important and what's
[3:13:25.520 --> 3:13:30.400]  i think it's constructive and i think the labeling gmo campaign in california i'm a
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:36.960]  i'm a definite activist in that where i'll be helping get people who are inspired by the
[3:13:36.960 --> 3:13:42.000]  vision of labeling gmo in california to then collect signatures we need 800 thousand signatures in
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:49.280]  the state between the first day we can start generate first and some date shortly after that
[3:13:49.840 --> 3:13:53.520]  so it's important that's where i'm i mean that's where i want to go i heard something really
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:14:01.440]  interesting i heard a guy named woody catch say something that gmo's are the derivatives of um
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:07.040]  basically exploitation of food just like derivatives were like the tool that created
[3:14:07.840 --> 3:14:16.560]  all this uh financial crash yeah uh gmo's are like tinkering and toying with a system that has
[3:14:16.560 --> 3:14:22.000]  naturally integrity you know food is naturally integrity but when you do gmo's you you create a
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:28.320]  system that excuses off its integrity and gives me to complete the whole collapse of life yeah
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:33.440]  that's a that's a good metaphor if if money is like food then derivatives are like are like gmo's
[3:14:33.440 --> 3:14:38.240]  yeah that that that sounds good that makes a lot of sense um michael i want to thank you
[3:14:38.800 --> 3:14:43.680]  for taking your time to join us here um appreciate appreciate all your comments by the way is there
[3:14:43.680 --> 3:14:48.640]  is there a blog or something you have where people can uh follow more of of your observations there
[3:14:48.640 --> 3:14:59.520]  yeah i have a blog um it's actually at uh www.rawallityhouse.us um that's like a reality but
[3:14:59.520 --> 3:15:10.000]  it's raw allity house r a w a l i p y house dot us um and that's our project for helping actually
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:16.720]  bring more raw food consciousness into it to be open in an east bay area all right all right very
[3:15:16.720 --> 3:15:22.080]  very good fantastic uh hopefully people got that that url uh i didn't i didn't catch it all
[3:15:23.040 --> 3:15:27.360]  that you hear me about occupy i might as well tell you that just for the fun of it i got the other
[3:15:28.240 --> 3:15:36.960]  website that also goes to the same site yeah raw q-pi oakland uh raw q-pi oakland dot com
[3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:42.160]  okay that sounds that sounds pretty good but it'll also go to the reality house okay well very good
[3:15:42.160 --> 3:15:45.920]  um i want to thank you michael for joining us uh been a pleasure chatting with you here
[3:15:45.920 --> 3:15:51.280]  on the info wars money bomb thank you so much for having mike okay up to good work all right thank
[3:15:51.280 --> 3:15:57.680]  you man take care all right and and for all the regular info wars listeners the alex jones fans
[3:15:58.480 --> 3:16:02.560]  i know we just we we just did three segments they're talking to people from oakland
[3:16:02.560 --> 3:16:07.760]  three different guests we have lined up and um you know i think it's really important to bring in
[3:16:07.760 --> 3:16:14.000]  their front line perspective on exactly what's happening there um they uh these are people who
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:19.040]  are in the raw foods community they're in the healthy eating community and they believe in
[3:16:19.040 --> 3:16:24.320]  liberty and they believe in freedom and they they believe in honesty uh especially corporate
[3:16:24.320 --> 3:16:30.880]  transparency so what's wonderful about all of this is that these are the same people who once
[3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:37.760]  they understand issues like the federal reserve they will naturally oppose that that kind of um
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:44.240]  a fraudulent modification of the money supply that the fed is doing so really this is not about
[3:16:44.240 --> 3:16:50.000]  left versus right this is not about progressive versus conservative this is this is about really
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  reality versus the fictions that the corporations and the controllers and the globalists are trying
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:03.360]  to weave into your heads like a mental viral infection like a like a mental inoculation
[3:17:03.360 --> 3:17:10.320]  of a deadly cognitive meme of sorts i mean that's that's it's it's really about truth versus fiction
[3:17:10.960 --> 3:17:17.280]  and that the truth is that the controllers out there don't want us to wake up they don't want
[3:17:17.280 --> 3:17:23.120]  us to do what we're doing which is to spread truth to spread information to ask great questions
[3:17:23.120 --> 3:17:29.760]  they don't want info wars to succeed you can bet on that and what more what better reason to go to
[3:17:29.760 --> 3:17:35.680]  info wars money bomb dot com and you can help defeat the globalists by supporting this organization
[3:17:35.680 --> 3:17:41.120]  and the work that it does again it's a fantastic group it's a fan it's just a super dedicated
[3:17:41.120 --> 3:17:46.560]  group of people who are going to be here for the next just many many hours coming up here
[3:17:46.560 --> 3:17:52.080]  bringing you more great information and i i i really hope to be working with this group long
[3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:57.680]  term to help spread the word about vaccines the dangers of vaccines the gmo's uh food freedom
[3:17:57.680 --> 3:18:03.120]  health freedom all of these crucial issues that they have been gracious enough to invite me in
[3:18:03.120 --> 3:18:08.480]  to comment on it's always an honor to be here as part of info wars bringing you that important
[3:18:08.480 --> 3:18:12.480]  information now i got a couple of news items for you some of these will really give you quite a
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:18.800]  chuckle and then we're going to go in a few minutes to robert scott bell uh he's also on the gcn radio
[3:18:18.800 --> 3:18:23.280]  network he has a sunday show there called the robert scott bell show and he's going to be joining us
[3:18:23.280 --> 3:18:29.600]  to give us an update on the raw milk freedom riders event that just took place two days ago
[3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:37.360]  in front of the fda where courageous raw milk moms were eating milk and cookies in front of the fda
[3:18:37.360 --> 3:18:44.800]  whereas alex would say al qaeda cookies in front of the fda and uh that's something that we did
[3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:50.800]  we also announced uh info wars covered that before it took place uh a lot of very important news about
[3:18:50.800 --> 3:18:55.600]  what took place there and the fda's response to that but first but first we've got some interesting
[3:18:55.600 --> 3:19:02.320]  news here's something a couple was lost in an apple orchard and they had to call 911 now i
[3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:06.240]  don't know if this was mentioned on the show in the last couple of days this news is about two days
[3:19:06.240 --> 3:19:14.240]  old but the reason i'm mentioning this check this out a couple from guess what massachusetts got lost
[3:19:14.240 --> 3:19:20.000]  in an apple orchard oh yeah here we go uh show the picture there it is there's the apple orchard
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:28.880]  it is about 200 acres of apples apple trees and uh 200 acres is not not that big of an orchard
[3:19:31.040 --> 3:19:38.320]  jaren says couldn't you just eat your way out of it right exactly yeah follow uh follow the trail
[3:19:38.320 --> 3:19:44.720]  as long as you can well they got lost in the apple orchard and they called 911 i saw some of the
[3:19:44.720 --> 3:19:50.160]  comments under this story one the first commenter says how did i know they were from massachusetts
[3:19:51.600 --> 3:19:55.280]  that might be a little uncalled for i mean come on not everybody in massachusetts
[3:19:55.280 --> 3:20:02.160]  loses their way in an apple orchard but uh the the reason that this is funny is because it shows
[3:20:02.160 --> 3:20:09.120]  just how much people have lost touch with reality i mean here in texas all right the idea of getting
[3:20:09.120 --> 3:20:16.720]  lost on on 200 acres it's hilarious i mean everybody's got a 200 acre ranch or knows somebody with a
[3:20:16.720 --> 3:20:22.080]  200 acre ranch somewhere some people have a 5 000 acre ranch yeah you could get lost on that but
[3:20:22.080 --> 3:20:28.480]  even then follow the fence line people uh follow the sun you know don't you know east from west
[3:20:29.680 --> 3:20:34.560]  they uh they parked their car here the news says their car was parked about only half a mile away
[3:20:34.560 --> 3:20:43.680]  wow and then as night began to fall they became frightened that they wouldn't be able to find
[3:20:43.680 --> 3:20:48.240]  their way back well that's what the breadcrumbs are for people you should leave breadcrumbs
[3:20:48.240 --> 3:20:55.520]  and uh they so they called 911 had to get rescued out of an apple orchard um folks if you get lost
[3:20:55.520 --> 3:21:00.160]  picking fruit uh you're gonna have a real hard time dealing with the globalist and the global
[3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:05.360]  economic collapse that's coming believe me maybe you should carry a flashlight with you
[3:21:05.360 --> 3:21:12.240]  uh a flashlight you know a magical little device that turns batteries into light yeah it's pretty
[3:21:12.240 --> 3:21:19.200]  amazing photons right out of the front of that little beam delivering device uh that it works
[3:21:19.200 --> 3:21:24.240]  wonders and you could also carry a compass maybe but they did have their cell phone yes indeed they
[3:21:24.240 --> 3:21:29.440]  did have their cell phone so they could call 911 and i wonder what that call must have been like
[3:21:29.440 --> 3:21:36.480]  hello 911 operator uh can we take your call uh yes i'm surrounded by apples it's it's like being
[3:21:36.480 --> 3:21:45.280]  attacked by the ghost of steve jobs how did they get out of that oh my lost in an apple orchard
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:51.840]  and then in a related story here we go i think we're gonna have robert scott bell on here
[3:21:51.840 --> 3:21:58.720]  in a few minutes i can't wait for his comments on this uh in a related story the bay bay area experts
[3:21:58.720 --> 3:22:04.400]  weigh in on uh gps shoes for alzheimer's patients i don't really have a picture for that sorry guys
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:13.360]  gps shoes for alzheimer's patients all right so the idea is that your parents or your grandparents
[3:22:13.360 --> 3:22:18.400]  they've got alzheimer's why well because they've been drinking all the metals in the water supply
[3:22:18.400 --> 3:22:23.040]  and and being injected with all the metals from the vaccines and they've been drinking the fluoride
[3:22:23.040 --> 3:22:28.560]  and so on and so forth we you know we know uh all about that stuff that people do to give themselves
[3:22:28.560 --> 3:22:36.320]  alzheimer's but then these alzheimer's patients they tend to wander off uh of course if you're
[3:22:36.320 --> 3:22:40.640]  this couple in the apple orchard you don't even need alzheimer's to do that you should just go out
[3:22:40.640 --> 3:22:45.760]  and start picking apples and it's over it's like dementia city i guess but uh these people these
[3:22:45.760 --> 3:22:50.640]  alzheimer's patients they wander off and that's that's dangerous because they don't know where they
[3:22:50.640 --> 3:22:56.960]  are sometimes they don't know how to get back so now they're pushing gps shoes so that you can
[3:22:56.960 --> 3:23:02.880]  track them you can bring up a website and you can say oh there's there's grandpa yeah on the corner
[3:23:02.880 --> 3:23:09.120]  of forth and main uh once again chugging shots at the irish bar that's not alzheimer's that's
[3:23:09.120 --> 3:23:15.440]  something else entirely um so now they want to push these shoes on us now alex warned you about
[3:23:15.440 --> 3:23:21.120]  this if you recall alex warned you about exactly this thing he said look first they're going to
[3:23:21.120 --> 3:23:27.440]  roll out the rfid tracking chips in your pets and then they're going to push them on your parents and
[3:23:27.440 --> 3:23:32.080]  your grandparents and your your alzheimer's your senior citizens people and then they're
[3:23:32.080 --> 3:23:36.880]  going to push them on on your children because children might get lost too and then finally
[3:23:36.880 --> 3:23:40.880]  it's going to be well if they're good enough for your children and your grandparents and your dog
[3:23:40.880 --> 3:23:45.520]  then they're going to push them on everybody everybody should be tracked what if you got lost
[3:23:46.320 --> 3:23:50.560]  what if you went on a fruit picking expedition and couldn't find your way back wouldn't you want
[3:23:50.560 --> 3:23:54.080]  to be able to press a button and have the authorities locate you by your shoes
[3:23:56.560 --> 3:24:01.520]  oh that's a good one why not just have gps underwear for that matter i mean you could lose a shoe
[3:24:02.160 --> 3:24:05.280]  at least for the most part you would probably still have your underwear on
[3:24:06.400 --> 3:24:10.160]  no matter what kind of fruit you were picking out there in the orchards gps underwear
[3:24:10.720 --> 3:24:14.640]  dot com somebody patent that before it gets taken by the globalist
[3:24:14.640 --> 3:24:22.480]  all right a little a little bit of humor here unbelievable all right robert scott bell is
[3:24:22.480 --> 3:24:28.880]  on the phone with us or i think he's joining us by skype that's great so let's go to robert now
[3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:33.680]  and let's have some coverage of the raw milk freedom writers event that just took place a
[3:24:33.680 --> 3:24:41.440]  couple a couple days ago robert are you with us man yeah mike i'm here thanks for having me on
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:47.040]  board tonight to report on an amazing event traveling from pennsylvania and down to the FDA
[3:24:47.040 --> 3:24:54.080]  in washington dc it was actually quite historic to see what a group of courageous somewhat angry
[3:24:54.080 --> 3:24:59.920]  but really pleasant moms can do to change the world yeah well you were right there you were an
[3:24:59.920 --> 3:25:06.000]  embedded reporter in that whole caravan caravan excuse me what was it like there robert describe
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:11.760]  the energy i know that adam kokesh from adam versus the man was there as well describe the people
[3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:18.800]  that you saw what actually took place during that that uh really an historic protest in uh for food
[3:25:18.800 --> 3:25:24.480]  freedom they were really quite revolutionary i mean on one hand it was really kind of interesting
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:29.520]  because when you think about doing a revolution you think of you know serious warriors armed to the
[3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:37.280]  teeth etc and here i was with a bunch of you know homeschool moms super moms you know house wise i
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:43.360]  mean these people were amazing we get up to pennsylvania to grab the raw milk or the illegal FDA
[3:25:43.360 --> 3:25:49.120]  contraband as it's called and at this point they're starting to decorate the vans i mean this is not
[3:25:49.120 --> 3:25:53.680]  like a revolution i think they would have envisioned back at the time of patrick henry or anybody
[3:25:53.680 --> 3:25:58.960]  but it worked nonetheless and they start posturing the vans writing on i almost felt like i was back
[3:25:58.960 --> 3:26:04.800]  in high school getting ready for the uh the homecoming and i was just confused by the the scene
[3:26:04.800 --> 3:26:11.520]  because it was so peaceful and so uh but not intimidating yet at the same time these women
[3:26:11.520 --> 3:26:17.200]  had contacted the FDA and said listen come and get us we're going to get the raw milk we know
[3:26:17.200 --> 3:26:21.760]  it's a violation of your federal law and you're going to call us criminals but we're taking this
[3:26:21.760 --> 3:26:26.400]  stuff off the border over the border and you come and get us well yeah that's that's a really
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:33.680]  important point is that wasn't it uh was it max kane who called to report a crime to the FDA right
[3:26:33.680 --> 3:26:38.560]  yeah they reported the crime and everything so it wasn't like these uh women were sneaking around
[3:26:38.560 --> 3:26:44.320]  and hopefully they weren't going to get caught i mean they were literally prepared to get arrested
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:49.840]  and not see their family for 24 hours or however long it would take and i had the the great fortune
[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:55.040]  and opportunity to meet with these women many in their homes met their little children these were
[3:26:55.040 --> 3:27:00.720]  kids none of them were unhealthy they were all drinking raw real milk uh you know eating some of
[3:27:00.720 --> 3:27:06.160]  them a pretty paleolithic diet but the kids were fine and i was just amused by the whole scene at
[3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:10.880]  the same time recognizing the serious nature of it i mean there was two things going on and being
[3:27:10.880 --> 3:27:16.000]  embedded in their mic it was just just an amazing thing to be part of that history now so carry on
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:21.760]  down right to the border we fully expected to have state troopers or FDA agents right at the border
[3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:26.960]  with pennsylvania and maryland stopped they took pictures interviewed by some reporters that were
[3:27:26.960 --> 3:27:32.000]  there of course adam kokesh was also filming and that was really quite i stayed in the van because
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:36.800]  i was literally broadcasting live during this whole event including through uh you know tv
[3:27:36.800 --> 3:27:42.720]  uploads and so we continued on down we passed a number of troopers along the way but the spirits
[3:27:42.720 --> 3:27:46.560]  were high i was interviewing some of these moms wait a minute wait a minute robert the troopers
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:53.280]  did not stop you and search your vans even though they they had uh a pre-knowledge that this was a
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:58.640]  criminal event taking place we were we were nervous a little bit as we we approached some troopers on
[3:27:58.640 --> 3:28:03.520]  the side of the road but uh apparently they were just setting speed traps you know more
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:08.160]  us interested in making a ticket quota than they were in these moms and it was you know literally
[3:28:08.160 --> 3:28:13.600]  all over their vans there was no question about what was going on here and uh these women actually
[3:28:13.600 --> 3:28:17.840]  had their own handcuffs and they were going to handcuff themselves to the milk that they were
[3:28:17.840 --> 3:28:24.320]  bringing oh man that's that's great stuff but uh okay so they went across state lines they bought
[3:28:24.320 --> 3:28:29.280]  the raw milk in pennsylvania right yeah and then they were carrying it across state lines into
[3:28:29.280 --> 3:28:36.240]  maryland now that is a violation of fda regulations yeah the prohibition of interstate transport
[3:28:36.240 --> 3:28:43.040]  of not drugs but raw milk food in fact food that has sustained life on planet earth for perhaps
[3:28:43.040 --> 3:28:49.040]  thousands of years that suddenly in the span of uh the last 20 or 30 became illegal and dangerous
[3:28:49.760 --> 3:28:54.160]  so these women were really you know like I said courageous women let the women lead you in this
[3:28:54.160 --> 3:28:59.200]  case as they have also in the vaccine awareness arena with all the children that are being harmed
[3:28:59.200 --> 3:29:03.840]  there uh so yeah we were witnessing we were part of this history we made our way down to silver
[3:29:03.840 --> 3:29:09.840]  spring maryland and as we approached the fda that's where it became a little bit uh nerve racking
[3:29:09.840 --> 3:29:15.280]  the ladies were looking around within the the vehicles and we saw lines of police cars and
[3:29:15.280 --> 3:29:21.760]  homeland security outside not the not pearly gates of the fda okay let's let's get to that in just
[3:29:21.760 --> 3:29:30.080]  a second but first how how could the fda have neglected to arrest these raw milk criminals
[3:29:30.080 --> 3:29:35.760]  given that the fda's position is that raw milk is so dangerous that transporting it across state line
[3:29:35.760 --> 3:29:43.040]  for the intent to consume it is is so as such a criminal act that it can kill little children
[3:29:43.040 --> 3:29:49.600]  how on earth could they have not arrested these these terrible criminals that isn't isn't that
[3:29:49.600 --> 3:29:55.120]  a gross violation of the fda's commitment to public safety or something well you would think
[3:29:55.120 --> 3:30:00.080]  so i mean literally it's on the books although we would call that law unconstitutional but the
[3:30:00.080 --> 3:30:06.080]  reality is they've you know taken part in horrific sting operations multi jurisdictional from federal
[3:30:06.080 --> 3:30:11.520]  state and local authorities whether it be in rossum in california whether it be uh dan algory
[3:30:11.520 --> 3:30:16.240]  the amish farmer in the baltimore maryland area uh so you know you fully expect that they were
[3:30:16.240 --> 3:30:21.200]  going to take a hard line on this so why didn't they it's a good question now these women did not
[3:30:21.200 --> 3:30:25.680]  look like hardened criminals they were tenacious in defense of their family and their children
[3:30:25.680 --> 3:30:29.920]  but they were you know absolute sweethearts that you know could not have better hospitality being
[3:30:29.920 --> 3:30:34.320]  up there with them but as we approached it was a little nerve wracking were they going to arrest
[3:30:34.320 --> 3:30:40.080]  us we pulled up uh into the uh part to try and go down into the parking lot they stopped us and
[3:30:40.080 --> 3:30:43.840]  said no you're not allowed in you got to turn around and they basically sent us across the
[3:30:43.840 --> 3:30:48.080]  street into the neighborhood so they were not interested in arresting these women at all in
[3:30:48.080 --> 3:30:53.120]  fact you know a hundred hundred fifty people were already there with raw milk and you know
[3:30:53.120 --> 3:30:57.760]  speaking protesting signs were waving as people were going by there was more milk to give away
[3:30:57.760 --> 3:31:03.920]  than i'd ever imagined would be there it's like a milk fest it was i think i think they were
[3:31:03.920 --> 3:31:09.360]  intimidated honestly and as we find out the fda themselves wrote you know made a made a release
[3:31:09.360 --> 3:31:14.960]  a major release on this day and we learned that in fact they talked to uh uh liz reitzig one of
[3:31:14.960 --> 3:31:21.760]  the developer let's say the organizers of this event and they basically had said we're we're not
[3:31:21.760 --> 3:31:26.320]  going to arrest you in fact all right well hold on robert let we'll get to that we'll get to that
[3:31:26.320 --> 3:31:30.080]  letter just a second sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you let's get to that letter just a
[3:31:30.080 --> 3:31:36.640]  second but first the the issue why they did not arrest these women let's make sure that that this
[3:31:36.640 --> 3:31:43.520]  is well understood by those watching and listening it is because the fda operates in darkness okay
[3:31:43.520 --> 3:31:51.360]  the fda operates shrouded by secrecy they they have a network of spies who infiltrate the raw
[3:31:51.360 --> 3:31:57.040]  milk community and try to purchase raw milk from these farmers i mean it is an infiltration network
[3:31:57.040 --> 3:32:04.400]  of of spies this is with covert cameras uh with with giving a secret testimony behind the scenes
[3:32:04.400 --> 3:32:09.920]  oh yeah we we caught this store that were this farmer selling raw milk we caught these eggs
[3:32:09.920 --> 3:32:16.080]  weren't uh refrigerated all these terrible things but but when you when you go face to face with the
[3:32:16.080 --> 3:32:23.040]  fda and you say come arrest us we're gonna drink this milk or even sell this milk right in front of
[3:32:23.040 --> 3:32:29.040]  you right in front of your headquarters they say what huh we what we're talking about not there's
[3:32:29.040 --> 3:32:34.400]  nothing there's nothing going on nothing to see here i think yeah it shows their cowardice and
[3:32:34.400 --> 3:32:40.240]  the reality also is that they know how absurd these laws are as well you know we we've talked about
[3:32:40.240 --> 3:32:43.920]  this would be one thing because these these women don't want war they just want to be left alone
[3:32:43.920 --> 3:32:49.200]  leave us alone let us care for our kids the way we believe is right well yeah yeah exactly i mean
[3:32:49.200 --> 3:32:54.320]  that's what that's what america is is founded on there's fundamental freedom to not have our
[3:32:54.320 --> 3:32:59.840]  lives interfered with by the government but but of course you know the raw milk thing is is it is
[3:32:59.840 --> 3:33:04.720]  the pivotal point of food freedom in america and that's why this was so important now now let's get
[3:33:04.720 --> 3:33:11.360]  to the letter and the conclusion of what the fda did in this case because the fda essentially
[3:33:11.360 --> 3:33:16.080]  they okay they refuse to arrest the women even though they they say they're criminals
[3:33:17.200 --> 3:33:24.560]  the in the letter then they revealed well uh we will selectively not arrest certain
[3:33:24.560 --> 3:33:29.440]  individuals if we don't want to but you're still a criminal isn't that what their letter said
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:34.800]  basically they said you know with interstate sale and commerce distribution of raw milk the fda has
[3:33:34.800 --> 3:33:40.560]  never taken now they're going back it's a never nor does it intend to take enforcement action against
[3:33:40.560 --> 3:33:45.440]  an individual who purchased and transported raw milk across state lines solely for his or her
[3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:51.040]  own personal consumption now i was not aware of this exception to the rule i think as we know
[3:33:51.040 --> 3:33:55.360]  they make it up as they go along and i think they realize that had they arrested because we were
[3:33:55.360 --> 3:33:59.280]  you know the the women were were sort of saying it might be good if we were arrested not that they
[3:33:59.280 --> 3:34:04.240]  wanted to be but if they were it would have been the the greatest embarrassment that the fda has
[3:34:04.240 --> 3:34:09.120]  ever faced among many that are yet to even be revealed and at that point i think it would have
[3:34:09.120 --> 3:34:14.240]  been all over for them i mean they're they're rapidly losing out on the let's say the the sympathy
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:18.800]  or empathy of a public that believes still that they might be doing some level of good to protect
[3:34:18.800 --> 3:34:24.080]  the public i mean you know ron paul in his in his wisdom saying i want to cut him 40 in the first
[3:34:24.080 --> 3:34:28.800]  year at you know my perspective is we they need to be cut 100 at this point because the states can
[3:34:30.480 --> 3:34:37.200]  food safety much better than a federal bureaucracy could ever do i i love ron paul's strategy of cuts
[3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:42.160]  it's awesome if we if we could get him into the white house man all the bureaucrats in
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:46.800]  washington would be looking for new jobs and that might be a very good thing indeed to get
[3:34:46.800 --> 3:34:51.360]  him off of our backs for the for the most part absolutely no go ahead robert with a comment
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:58.880]  mike this strategy is astounding because it showed me firsthand the power of the individual but
[3:34:58.880 --> 3:35:05.760]  also the power of moms unarmed moms that simply carried the weapon if you will of raw real milk
[3:35:05.760 --> 3:35:12.240]  and how it you know a multi-billion dollar agency back down to this peaceful nonviolent
[3:35:12.240 --> 3:35:17.200]  gondi like demonstration simply to provide food to their fellow man and woman and child
[3:35:17.760 --> 3:35:23.840]  and that shows i i think it should show that the enemy although it is intimidating and they you
[3:35:23.840 --> 3:35:28.560]  know they have some level of guns and they they are willing to utilize violence when confronted
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:33.760]  in this peaceful way can be pushed back now i'm not under the illusion that this is all over at
[3:35:33.760 --> 3:35:38.880]  this point but i think this victory is something that is not peric it's a very real victory that
[3:35:38.880 --> 3:35:43.360]  should really be a lightning rod for others around the country to recognize that the most
[3:35:43.360 --> 3:35:48.640]  powerful tool we have is our consent and withdrawing that consent as these moms have to say listen
[3:35:48.640 --> 3:35:53.120]  we don't care what you say the law is we're going across the border we're coming back come and get
[3:35:53.120 --> 3:35:58.880]  us it puts these bureaucrats in a state of recognition of who they really are cowards
[3:35:58.880 --> 3:36:04.080]  abby abject cowards who do not deserve to be labeled americans as long as they're enforcing
[3:36:04.080 --> 3:36:09.440]  these illegal unconstitutional provisions within the law well yeah because where where do they
[3:36:09.440 --> 3:36:16.160]  where they stop with all of this it gets pretty crazy and and and yet uh comes back to the importance
[3:36:16.160 --> 3:36:20.880]  of having the freedom to speak out having the freedom to have the the real journalism like
[3:36:20.880 --> 3:36:26.480]  what you just did robert by being embedded with that group of moms that's real journalism i mean
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:33.440]  you'll notice uh hey cnn wasn't there um abc wasn't there fox news wasn't there how come they didn't
[3:36:33.440 --> 3:36:37.040]  have reporters writing along because they don't want to draw attention to the fact that we should
[3:36:37.040 --> 3:36:43.200]  have food freedom you see it was you and russia tv and and natural news and info wars i mean
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:49.440]  folks this is why your support is really crucial uh the fundraising right now at info wars money
[3:36:49.440 --> 3:36:57.280]  bomb dot com is up to i believe 142 000 there's still a lot to go so please consider your
[3:36:57.280 --> 3:37:04.400]  support at that website yeah there it is you can check it out and uh yeah look at that 142 000
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:09.760]  dollars and much more to go this is money that's going to be well spent around here at info wars
[3:37:09.760 --> 3:37:15.200]  dot com on bringing you more truth and asking more questions of the globalists and the federal
[3:37:15.200 --> 3:37:19.760]  reserve and the fda and all of those who say they're protecting us when in fact they tend to be taking
[3:37:19.760 --> 3:37:25.360]  away our rights instead now now robert i'm going to get a little a little wild with with you here
[3:37:25.360 --> 3:37:31.520]  on this topic what about i mean how far are they going to push this because technically technically
[3:37:31.520 --> 3:37:37.680]  if you had if you had moms with infants who are breastfeeding if they drive across state lines
[3:37:37.680 --> 3:37:44.880]  aren't they carrying raw milk in their own breasts is the fda going to outlaw women's breasts next
[3:37:44.880 --> 3:37:50.640]  well we see that the issue of pasteurization is really the issue because uh women's breasts in in
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:56.880]  fact engorge with milk uh well present some level of competition to the you know agribusiness big
[3:37:56.880 --> 3:38:02.960]  agribusiness farming uh practices if you will so it isn't too far afield this idea of pasteurizing
[3:38:02.960 --> 3:38:08.640]  breast milk mandating it in fact because there are uh let's say moms who are not able to produce milk
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:13.040]  and there are actually communities where moms get together and provide breast milk for other babies
[3:38:13.040 --> 3:38:18.800]  and there has been some push to have that forced pasteurization impact on human breast milk
[3:38:18.800 --> 3:38:24.320]  before it can be given to another baby of course that would utterly destroy the uh nutritional
[3:38:24.320 --> 3:38:29.520]  integrity of the product if you will call it a product uh so it isn't too far afield of what has
[3:38:29.520 --> 3:38:35.760]  been already proposed uh within a federal or state guidelines in regards to a human breast milk
[3:38:35.760 --> 3:38:40.800]  how far will they push it i think right now you know is this the uh you know the the the shot
[3:38:40.800 --> 3:38:46.560]  heard around the world for food freedom and this leads to something far bigger because if people see
[3:38:46.560 --> 3:38:52.960]  how a few women i mean it wasn't a lot a few women have taken down to some degree that multi
[3:38:52.960 --> 3:38:59.200]  billion dollar federal agency with very little money no a shoestring budget and we talk about
[3:38:59.200 --> 3:39:03.360]  you know what the new media is doing like what you do with natural news like what alex jones
[3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:08.880]  does with info wars my gosh on a shoestring the world is changing because the first amendment
[3:39:08.880 --> 3:39:14.800]  the free press is being restored not because we're asking permission of the government or any entity
[3:39:14.800 --> 3:39:19.840]  in washington dc but simply because the people are hungry for this as they are hungry for the raw
[3:39:19.840 --> 3:39:25.760]  real milk and the raw foods unadulterated by the fear and death administration yeah absolutely
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:29.600]  people are hungry for the truth that's why there is so much support it's incredible people are
[3:39:29.600 --> 3:39:34.480]  donating by the minute right now there is an 800 number you can call it's triple eight
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:41.840]  that is eight eight eight two five three three one three nine to offer your support to the info wars
[3:39:41.840 --> 3:39:48.320]  media system here that is bringing you not just the info wars nightly news every weeknight but
[3:39:48.320 --> 3:39:53.440]  of course also the alex jones radio show every single weekday and uh robert just mentioned
[3:39:53.440 --> 3:39:57.840]  that we're doing this on a shoestring well really yeah compared to the globalists who are tossing
[3:39:57.840 --> 3:40:02.800]  around not just billions of dollars but even trillions of dollars if you consider what's
[3:40:02.800 --> 3:40:08.560]  going on here at info wars the power and the reach of this information with just a few hundred
[3:40:08.560 --> 3:40:15.920]  thousand dollars in an event like this it's amazing your your your donation is highly leveraged and
[3:40:15.920 --> 3:40:22.240]  you know as as the guy who runs natural news i know what it takes in terms of of money to just
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:27.680]  tell the truth it's not free okay the bandwidth that you're using right now to watch this it
[3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:32.320]  isn't free it costs something the cameras in the studio they're not free some of them are
[3:40:32.320 --> 3:40:37.600]  over five thousand dollars each you know the the employees they got to be paid too i mean everything
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:41.920]  costs money just to tell you the truth and you don't see the government showing up hey have some
[3:40:41.920 --> 3:40:46.160]  grant money you know like they do with the mainstream media they pay them off to make sure
[3:40:46.160 --> 3:40:50.800]  they keep running the the the white house version of the news you don't see there's no big checks
[3:40:50.800 --> 3:40:55.840]  coming into info wars from the government or the or the Rockefeller foundation or anything like that
[3:40:55.840 --> 3:41:01.120]  this is this is up to you if you wanted to continue please consider supporting it at info
[3:41:01.120 --> 3:41:06.080]  wars money bomb dot com now back to you robert i i by the way i really want to thank you for
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:11.840]  covering that event what do you think about this issue of this couple that got lost in the apple
[3:41:11.840 --> 3:41:17.280]  orchard in massachusetts have you ever heard of that happening before well you know you and i talked
[3:41:17.280 --> 3:41:22.320]  earlier about heavy metals and i have to assume that these people may be loaded with heavy metals
[3:41:22.320 --> 3:41:26.880]  if they can't find their way out of an apple orchard and we're gonna have to look at detoxifying
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:35.520]  this couple if they've survived their ordeal well yeah um maybe uh copper toxicity aluminum toxicity
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:41.200]  mercury well hey there's mercury and aluminum in many vaccines there's uh copper in your water
[3:41:41.200 --> 3:41:46.720]  pipes there's there's lead i mean wasn't even even the halloween face paint for children a lot of
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:51.040]  that was found to have high levels of lead in it what a wonderful little halloween gift for your
[3:41:51.040 --> 3:41:56.000]  children huh yeah well exactly i mean listen i understand some people can be absent minded to
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:01.920]  get lost in places but uh you know the idea or the understanding here is that the entire american
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:06.880]  continent the people most of them if you will not those that tend to you know listen to you or alex
[3:42:06.880 --> 3:42:12.160]  or or others that listen to the show uh they they have an awareness i think partly or maybe a large
[3:42:12.160 --> 3:42:16.560]  part due to the fact that they're they're choosing better foods they're detoxifying their bodies
[3:42:16.560 --> 3:42:21.440]  they can start seeing clearly they're unraveling the dangerous vaccines and undoing them or even
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:26.320]  not giving them to their children so that they have a chance to actually see and think and act
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:31.680]  clearly well this isn't the look at the insanity and you wrote about this on natural news the
[3:42:31.680 --> 3:42:37.040]  insanity of people what are they politically choosing a democrat or republican outside of
[3:42:37.040 --> 3:42:42.240]  ron paul i mean they're choosing the same disaster how could this be explained except by heavy metal
[3:42:42.240 --> 3:42:48.480]  toxicity i i do not know robert i do not know i mean maybe heavy metals is is part of the um
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:53.680]  explanation it certainly brought down the roman empire or at least played a big part in the poisoning
[3:42:53.680 --> 3:42:58.080]  of the minds of the roman people led poisoning through the aqueducts that's a classic example
[3:42:58.080 --> 3:43:04.480]  out of history could it be that our modern civilization is obviously is suffering a
[3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:11.200]  downfall right now things are crashing in many in many ways you know the money supply the the
[3:43:11.200 --> 3:43:16.720]  ethics the corporate ethics out there the agricultural system and so on could it be that we're we're
[3:43:16.720 --> 3:43:24.480]  suffering our planet's second major metals toxicity crisis after the roman empire they're
[3:43:24.480 --> 3:43:28.320]  probably more in history that we just aren't aware of at the moment are you aware of any more in
[3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:34.640]  history of of metals destroying a civilization yeah not on the scale of of ancient rome but
[3:43:34.640 --> 3:43:39.440]  certainly uh from the standpoint of historical records or reference points to uh other heavy
[3:43:39.440 --> 3:43:45.120]  metals like uranium and nuclear uh downfall uh that may be in evidence if you will uh but
[3:43:45.120 --> 3:43:51.040]  certainly we've seen you know in a contemporary sense the those that work in the you know the metal
[3:43:51.040 --> 3:43:56.560]  and smelting industry or those that were the the so-called headers of a centuries past the mad
[3:43:56.560 --> 3:44:00.960]  headers as they were called working with milk mercury on the felt and of course the the dental
[3:44:00.960 --> 3:44:05.760]  profession which still has the highest uh suicide rate of any profession medical profession not too
[3:44:05.760 --> 3:44:11.200]  far behind but the dental profession is still working with mercury of course those that still
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:16.240]  embrace mercury and vaccinations i mean these people have to be going mad also because of the
[3:44:16.240 --> 3:44:20.480]  damage that they're doing to these children whether they're consciously aware of it or not
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:26.160]  i mean it is a brutal thing it is reducing purposefully i think the consciousness of these
[3:44:26.160 --> 3:44:31.600]  children so that they grow up to be slaves not free humans not free sovereign humans and we
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:35.680]  could see that the use of metals in this way fluoride is well increasing the uptake of heavy
[3:44:35.680 --> 3:44:42.800]  metals increasing or lowering i should say the the awareness potential of any human at any age
[3:44:42.800 --> 3:44:47.760]  and so these as well we see the controversy of the Gardasil against the HPV that doesn't
[3:44:47.760 --> 3:44:55.120]  cause cervical cancer so creating infertility in ever-growing numbers also reducing global
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:44:59.840]  population which there is clearly an agenda to do so we've covered that on the air and of course
[3:44:59.840 --> 3:45:06.000]  alex jones covered that so well with info wars so we just do play together they are all related
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:10.560]  wait a second robert there's another breaking story i want to get your comments on uh just broke
[3:45:10.560 --> 3:45:17.920]  what was it two nights ago the cdc has been caught covering up and distorting some data
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:23.040]  linking mercury containing vaccines to autism that's that was some big breaking news can you
[3:45:23.040 --> 3:45:27.440]  give us a quick rundown on that story because i know you covered it huge yeah i interviewed brian
[3:45:27.440 --> 3:45:32.560]  hooker the phd last week who's been uh gathering through freedom of information act request in
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:36.720]  fact on the show he i said how would he how did you do this because after you set up a pattern
[3:45:36.720 --> 3:45:41.840]  of foias they start uh basically denying them because they see it's coming from the sea he says
[3:45:41.840 --> 3:45:45.600]  he enlisted every one of his family members to distant relatives and they were going after
[3:45:45.600 --> 3:45:52.480]  this for years and he found out in fact that the five the five studies that the cdc claims cleared
[3:45:52.480 --> 3:45:58.480]  uh mercury based or the marisol that and you know add that uh preservative in vaccines and vaccines
[3:45:58.480 --> 3:46:05.680]  in general as the cause of autism or the autism spectrum all five in fact not four not three
[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:11.120]  not two no one all five were in fact fraudulent they're devoid of real science and in fact the
[3:46:11.120 --> 3:46:17.920]  entire cdc may come crashing down with this revelation as it becomes more and more obvious now
[3:46:17.920 --> 3:46:23.280]  the old media as you know is not going to cover this will uh you let's say reluctantly if anything
[3:46:23.280 --> 3:46:27.040]  they will eventually but we are now you know breaking it you're breaking it alex jones is
[3:46:27.040 --> 3:46:32.160]  breaking it and this is a story that is not going away the entire vaccine complex is going to come
[3:46:32.160 --> 3:46:36.080]  crumbling down eventually when we'll look back and say how barbaric that we ever fell for their
[3:46:36.080 --> 3:46:41.360]  lies yeah well wait a minute robert how were the data altered in in those five studies specifically
[3:46:41.360 --> 3:46:47.440]  what did they do did they remove data did they change the data did they massage the data because
[3:46:47.440 --> 3:46:52.960]  you know they like to massage data there at the cdc they like massage therapists almost right
[3:46:52.960 --> 3:46:57.680]  brian hooker in fact went through that in detail that indeed they would they eliminated certain
[3:46:57.680 --> 3:47:02.400]  data pools that showed what they didn't want to show because these were at preordained reports
[3:47:02.400 --> 3:47:07.760]  much like the flexor report of 1910 that ushered in petrochemical pharmaceutical pseudoscientific
[3:47:07.760 --> 3:47:13.520]  medicine in the 20th century these were reports designed to prove something that they had to prove
[3:47:13.520 --> 3:47:18.480]  in order to throw off the hunt throw off the scent because even in the 90s as increases in autism
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:24.240]  were becoming evidenced many parents were beginning to be much more reluctant to allow their children
[3:47:24.240 --> 3:47:29.040]  to be vaccinated of course with the work of you know you've interviewed them dr andrew wakefield
[3:47:29.040 --> 3:47:33.840]  and this was this had to be shut down and so there was a hat there had to be preordained reports
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:37.840]  that they could point to and in fact thorson remember him he was one of the one of the yeah
[3:47:37.840 --> 3:47:43.840]  thorson a cdc investigator indicted by a federal grand jury in atlanta for accusations of money
[3:47:43.840 --> 3:47:50.480]  laundering of cdc grant money correct yeah now imagine if that were someone on our our side of
[3:47:50.480 --> 3:47:55.600]  the scientific realm like the the the geyers these uh this father son team phd medical doctors
[3:47:55.600 --> 3:48:00.240]  that had found this out had they you know got money laundered and left the country do you think
[3:48:00.240 --> 3:48:05.200]  that would have been front page news in every paper around the world oh yeah of course and they
[3:48:05.200 --> 3:48:11.200]  completely ignored thorson yeah yeah well exactly they just they just decide that that's not news
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:14.560]  is not important they don't want people to cover it just like they didn't have any reporters at the
[3:48:14.560 --> 3:48:21.120]  raw milk event they're not covering the cdc uh data alteration story but but boy they sure go
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:26.800]  after wakefield even when he didn't when he did not alter his data they still accuse him of doing
[3:48:26.800 --> 3:48:33.120]  so and that brings delight again mike the reason why what you're doing is so important what alex
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:38.000]  jones is doing is so important or why people need to support these efforts because again no grants
[3:48:38.000 --> 3:48:43.040]  from government no quarter from government and certainly no pharmaceutical money no oil money
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:47.200]  is supporting this there no special i mean it's literally people it's like the ron paul campaign
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:51.520]  to wake people up it's a lot of people that are waking up and saying i'm i've had enough of it
[3:48:51.520 --> 3:48:56.560]  i'm not waiting i'm not asking for permission it's time to take it over and we're doing it
[3:48:56.560 --> 3:49:02.000]  with an end around through creating the new media which is like the old old media when it was a free
[3:49:02.000 --> 3:49:07.120]  press it is a free press right here right now what you're hearing on this info more info wars
[3:49:07.120 --> 3:49:11.520]  money bomb yeah it's really it's really crucial in fact i wanted to get your comments about the
[3:49:11.520 --> 3:49:17.680]  role of independent media today so let's shift to that topic as we've already covered the cdc
[3:49:17.680 --> 3:49:22.560]  in some detail there but i know i know we're going to be covering that more on naturalnews.com later
[3:49:22.560 --> 3:49:26.880]  on if if you're interested in covering it and probably probably you'll see some of those articles
[3:49:26.880 --> 3:49:32.080]  on info wars.com as well i know curt nemo is always interested in some of some of the more
[3:49:32.080 --> 3:49:38.320]  investigative reports that that we're turning up and we we share them here um robert let's let's
[3:49:38.320 --> 3:49:45.840]  get to the big issue of why the independent new media is crucial for the protection of freedom
[3:49:45.840 --> 3:49:52.800]  in our nation you are a a significant operator in the new media you're part of the gcn the genesis
[3:49:52.800 --> 3:49:59.200]  communications network with ted aanderson uh you you work with with natural news on on a radio show
[3:49:59.920 --> 3:50:05.280]  you uh you you you've been in the industry a long time you you you watch and listen to alex
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:10.640]  jones you see what i'm doing and and others out there in your opinion robert why is it crucial
[3:50:10.640 --> 3:50:17.120]  that we continue you know info wars in particular because that's what the focus here today uh have
[3:50:17.120 --> 3:50:22.960]  the financial support to continue why does that matter to our collective future robert well the
[3:50:22.960 --> 3:50:28.400]  first amendment for a free press was really what kept you know the government in check and government
[3:50:28.400 --> 3:50:33.280]  of course was the you know the great threat to liberty it always was from the very foundation
[3:50:33.280 --> 3:50:38.560]  it was a risky proposition to you know basically have a federal government and our founders knew
[3:50:38.560 --> 3:50:43.520]  it the framers knew it even and the free press was able to call things out that you know the
[3:50:43.520 --> 3:50:48.160]  crony if you will capitalism as we call it now which is what the the press is today part of
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:54.480]  that crony capitalistic uh structure is such that these uh let's say illicit illegal activities
[3:50:54.480 --> 3:51:00.160]  and sometimes life terminating activities of government are covered up or applauded even
[3:51:00.720 --> 3:51:05.040]  by that old media you know the media conglomerates that you know can trace trace back up to the
[3:51:05.040 --> 3:51:09.360]  you know the few families that are controlling a lot of these things and on beyond that and so
[3:51:09.360 --> 3:51:13.360]  supporting this is all you know i'll give you one example not to toot your own horn mic but i you
[3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:17.920]  know it's something that's very recent fresh in my mind is your coverage of this product
[3:51:17.920 --> 3:51:23.040]  recently and you know if you can mention if you want but basically that the fda supposedly if we
[3:51:23.040 --> 3:51:28.480]  go back to the dawn of the fda we have harvey wiley who was really sincere about his efforts the
[3:51:28.480 --> 3:51:33.680]  pure food and drug act to keep adulterated toxic poisons out of the food supply which may have
[3:51:33.680 --> 3:51:37.920]  been a legitimate role but of course it was corrupted and bought out by the pharmaceutical
[3:51:37.920 --> 3:51:42.560]  interest as well the german chemical companies as well and that took everything out of the equation
[3:51:42.560 --> 3:51:46.800]  now the fda became the opposite of what it may have been initially well that's the thing i mean
[3:51:46.800 --> 3:51:52.400]  we we we look to the fda to or at least the mainstream people look to the fda to protect them
[3:51:52.400 --> 3:51:58.560]  that's what they think the fda is doing but in reality the fda is in bed with the pharmaceutical
[3:51:58.560 --> 3:52:03.840]  companies it's in bed with the vaccines now there is a certain segment of the fda the office of
[3:52:03.840 --> 3:52:09.520]  criminal investigations let's say that is nailing let's say doctors who are injecting people with
[3:52:09.520 --> 3:52:15.920]  fraudulent vaccines that's going on they catch those people or people who are importing uh fraud
[3:52:15.920 --> 3:52:20.640]  you know counterfeit drugs or things like that there's some really wacky stuff that goes on out
[3:52:20.640 --> 3:52:26.960]  there and the oci actually serves some you know some useful role in in going after the real hard
[3:52:26.960 --> 3:52:33.520]  core criminal crooks but but by and large the fda is just out there pounding vitamins and pounding
[3:52:33.520 --> 3:52:39.920]  supplements and trying to make them illegal and then pushing drugs and keeping them on the market
[3:52:39.920 --> 3:52:44.960]  even though those drugs are killing people so you know the fda it's sort of it it has
[3:52:44.960 --> 3:52:50.320]  abandoned its core principles and left us with like we got to walk through the minefield now
[3:52:50.320 --> 3:52:54.640]  ourselves and figured out because they're not really helping us yeah long ago they abandoned
[3:52:54.640 --> 3:52:58.480]  it now the american people are finally waking up to that reality and you mentioned about
[3:52:58.480 --> 3:53:02.320]  counterfeit drugs i thought one of the funniest things i remember hearing in recent years was
[3:53:02.320 --> 3:53:07.520]  that they were warning americans against drugs imported from canada right that they were really
[3:53:08.640 --> 3:53:13.680]  and i was like what about the drugs here in america that you approve that are killing hundreds of
[3:53:13.680 --> 3:53:18.880]  thousands of americans every year what what is not dangerous about that and so you know that's
[3:53:18.880 --> 3:53:23.680]  where they've lost their mind they don't understand real issues of safety when we know what is really
[3:53:23.680 --> 3:53:28.880]  harming and of course the supplements themselves are by and large not killing anybody but on the
[3:53:28.880 --> 3:53:33.440]  occasion on the chance that somebody does something that adulterates a supplement
[3:53:33.440 --> 3:53:37.920]  the free press calls it out that happened recently with natural news and my goodness
[3:53:37.920 --> 3:53:43.200]  within 24 hours 36 hours what what what happened with the free press is that it would have taken
[3:53:43.200 --> 3:53:48.960]  the year or two and millions of dollars of taxpayer funds to do what was done by a free press calling
[3:53:48.960 --> 3:53:55.200]  danger where danger really existed yeah yeah clearly when i mean i mean it's it's crucial
[3:53:55.200 --> 3:53:59.920]  that the free press the new media here exists to be able to ask these questions and and again
[3:53:59.920 --> 3:54:04.560]  some of the things that info wars is focused on is is asking those questions like hey how come
[3:54:04.560 --> 3:54:12.320]  ron paul isn't being given the airtime that he deserves as really the the only uh intelligent
[3:54:12.320 --> 3:54:17.360]  presidential candidate who can lay out a plan for a balanced budget now you've interviewed ron paul
[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:22.240]  before uh what are your thoughts to shift a bit to politics we've only got a few minutes left here
[3:54:22.240 --> 3:54:29.520]  with you robert but on the political side uh what's your take on now kane uh herman kane being
[3:54:29.520 --> 3:54:34.640]  being pushed out there as a solution even though he's a federal reserve insider yeah kane is funny
[3:54:34.640 --> 3:54:41.520]  he's the only guy in one minute that can reverse his position every 10 seconds not realize it you
[3:54:41.520 --> 3:54:45.360]  know i don't know how he does that i don't know if it's a talent or a fault i can't make out but
[3:54:45.360 --> 3:54:49.520]  yes he should be disqualified just on the basis that he was a former federal reserve chairman
[3:54:49.520 --> 3:54:53.920]  that alone should do it but yeah i've had the great fortune of interviewing uh ron paul over
[3:54:53.920 --> 3:54:59.600]  the years as well and i tell you he's always been in the corner of freedom of course me as a homeopath
[3:54:59.600 --> 3:55:04.240]  someone who supported me in my efforts and endeavors to get natural medicine out to the people
[3:55:04.240 --> 3:55:09.920]  and he's an md didn't bother him in the least and he you know the man of integrity like no other
[3:55:09.920 --> 3:55:15.600]  that i'd ever met in politics for sure and certainly they don't want him to be president
[3:55:15.600 --> 3:55:22.720]  but as we've seen a few moms can roll back the federal bureaucracy by standing up for liberty
[3:55:22.720 --> 3:55:28.480]  by not cowering in fear by being willing to be arrested through their civil disobedience
[3:55:28.480 --> 3:55:33.600]  and more of that needs to be done in consciousness these women were not unconscious at all whereas
[3:55:33.600 --> 3:55:38.080]  some of the occupy wall street people are not fully conscious although they have a discontent
[3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:43.360]  that may be legitimate what we've got to do is really stop believing anything that is said
[3:55:43.360 --> 3:55:48.960]  in the old media and support these new media outlets like info wars as well in this way
[3:55:48.960 --> 3:55:54.640]  and then a ron paul for president becomes a reality not something that's just a fantasy
[3:55:55.600 --> 3:56:01.520]  yeah well well said robert uh you are right on the money on that issue and i really appreciate
[3:56:01.520 --> 3:56:06.560]  you joining us here thanks for taking the time to offer us your ideas here on the info wars
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:10.800]  money bomb robert you could check in with you thanks mike adams and and say thanks to alex
[3:56:10.800 --> 3:56:14.640]  jones for all his good work for me i really appreciate everything that's being done i
[3:56:14.640 --> 3:56:22.240]  certainly will if we can find him he got out of his chair here and just vanished i don't
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:26.480]  i'm not sure where he is um but but obviously he's you know he's taking a break because he's
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:31.440]  got a lot ahead a lot of hard work and thank you robert for your segment there great information
[3:56:31.440 --> 3:56:36.960]  from robert scott bell now before we uh get to the top of this hour uh can you give us an overhead
[3:56:36.960 --> 3:56:42.400]  shot here guys a couple of videos that are in the warehouse back there i i actually went through
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:48.800]  the warehouse to find what videos that i would personally recommend if a friend came to me
[3:56:48.800 --> 3:56:53.680]  and they said hey what should i be watching here here are a couple of them a little reflection on
[3:56:53.680 --> 3:57:00.240]  that one the world according to monsanto here and then also scientists under attack and this one
[3:57:00.240 --> 3:57:05.840]  has jeffrey smith in it this is a very important film and the world according to monsanto is by
[3:57:05.840 --> 3:57:11.360]  marie monique robin uh this is uh here it says right here from agent orange to genetically modified
[3:57:11.360 --> 3:57:18.480]  crops uh these two films will absolutely blow your mind and open your mind on these issues and if
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:24.240]  you're looking for something to give to someone uh as the the holiday season is coming up uh you
[3:57:24.240 --> 3:57:29.440]  you may want to consider getting a few of these from the info wars store and the the guys are in
[3:57:29.440 --> 3:57:33.440]  the back there ready to ship these out to you they've got inventory on both of these films as

[3:57:39.200 --> 3:57:43.920]  to ship those out that's another way that you can help support the info wars money bomb it's not
[3:57:43.920 --> 3:57:49.200]  just about making a donation although that's a good idea as well but you can also support the
[3:57:49.200 --> 3:57:55.120]  store here and by the way uh just so you know you know i don't i don't have any financial ties
[3:57:55.120 --> 3:58:01.600]  whatsoever to these movies or even this organization i'm i'm always here on a volunteer basis that's
[3:58:01.600 --> 3:58:06.480]  because i believe in the mission of what alex is doing here and what the info wars team is doing
[3:58:06.480 --> 3:58:11.120]  i believe in freedom of the press i believe in liberty i believe in the bill of rights i believe
[3:58:11.120 --> 3:58:18.000]  in the constitution i believe in ron paul all right i believe in everything the core principles
[3:58:18.000 --> 3:58:23.200]  of what what info wars stands for and that's exactly why i'm here in fact that's the only reason
[3:58:23.200 --> 3:58:29.360]  why i'm here because principle is what we've got to stand up for today in this info war that is
[3:58:29.360 --> 3:58:35.760]  taking place all right now coming up i'm going to go to a video uh let's see homeland security
[3:58:35.760 --> 3:58:41.280]  taken over walmart that's a little video segment coming up here in just a few seconds i'm not sure

[3:58:49.040 --> 3:58:53.360]  goodbye and thanks for having me on if alex doesn't make it back i might be on for just a couple of
[3:58:53.360 --> 3:58:58.400]  minutes to turn it back over to alex but in either case it has been my honor and my pleasure

[3:59:03.200 --> 3:59:05.840]  thanks for thanks for staying tuned watch this segment
[3:59:08.720 --> 3:59:14.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance
[3:59:14.320 --> 3:59:19.520]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[3:59:19.520 --> 3:59:25.280]  underneath americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president in congress
[3:59:25.280 --> 3:59:31.440]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[3:59:31.440 --> 3:59:37.840]  to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[3:59:37.840 --> 3:59:42.480]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[3:59:42.480 --> 3:59:47.600]  tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[3:59:47.600 --> 3:59:52.640]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[3:59:52.640 --> 4:00:00.080]  we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy a fall janet napolitano secretary of the
[4:00:00.080 --> 4:00:09.280]  department of homeland security homeland security begins with hometown security well it's here 1984
[4:00:09.280 --> 4:00:14.800]  in america this is the straw that breaks the camel's back there is no doubt that we're in deep
[4:00:14.800 --> 4:00:20.640]  trouble as a society the head of homeland security big sis janet napolitano has now come out and
[4:00:20.640 --> 4:00:27.280]  announced that over 800 walmarts in the next month are going to install telescreens at the checkout
[4:00:27.280 --> 4:00:36.000]  scanner with different federal orders to spy on the other people shopping that's why i'm pleased
[4:00:36.000 --> 4:00:42.640]  that walmart is helping to make our communities more safe and secure if you see something suspicious
[4:00:42.640 --> 4:00:48.480]  in the parking lot or in the store say something immediately homeland security is putting up billboards
[4:00:48.480 --> 4:00:53.120]  all over the country but say if you see something suspicious communicate it okay well i'm going
[4:00:53.120 --> 4:00:57.920]  to communicate something to you homeland security i see it suspicious that trillions of dollars have
[4:00:57.920 --> 4:01:01.920]  come up missing and the private fellow reserve won't tell congress where it's gone and it turns
[4:01:01.920 --> 4:01:06.640]  out it's foreign banks and corporations i find all the corruption in government that's growing out
[4:01:06.640 --> 4:01:12.400]  of control to be suspicious no wonder you want to distract us with all your fables about terrorist
[4:01:12.400 --> 4:01:18.880]  buggy men for anybody who studied history this is completely obvious we are going into hardcore
[4:01:18.880 --> 4:01:27.200]  tyranny report suspicious activity to local police or sheriff if you need help ask a walmart
[4:01:27.200 --> 4:01:33.920]  manager for assistance this is big brother on steroids and folks this is not a surprise to
[4:01:33.920 --> 4:01:38.000]  people that have been reading our sites because homeland security for at least two years has been
[4:01:38.000 --> 4:01:43.200]  on record starting these viper teams and and checkpoints in boston and new york city and
[4:01:43.200 --> 4:01:48.960]  miami it suddenly it's on the local news showing them doing the grope downs grabbing people's genitals
[4:01:48.960 --> 4:01:54.400]  patting them down on the streets of america this is wrong on so many fronts it's a violation of the
[4:01:54.400 --> 4:01:59.920]  tenth amendment tower tampa police and federal governments agencies are teaming up to keep your
[4:01:59.920 --> 4:02:06.560]  family safe it's the sort of security we've seen a lot of since 9 11 now here at the bus station
[4:02:06.560 --> 4:02:12.480]  it's all part of what homeland security calls viper for visible intermodal prevention and response
[4:02:12.480 --> 4:02:17.920]  this way us and our partners are ready to move in at a moment's notice folks it doesn't get any more
[4:02:17.920 --> 4:02:24.240]  big brother 1984 than this but it's not going to be big brother it literally is big sis when
[4:02:24.240 --> 4:02:31.360]  you're checking out looking down on you telling you to spy on people around you injecting paranoia
[4:02:31.360 --> 4:02:37.440]  into the society this is worse than those terror threat levels they had and and and now the former
[4:02:37.440 --> 4:02:42.000]  head of homeland security ridge has gone public saying they would issue those for political purposes
[4:02:42.880 --> 4:02:48.480]  a vigorous some might say dramatic discussion ensued ashcroft strongly urged an increase in
[4:02:48.480 --> 4:02:53.840]  the threat level and was supported by rumsfeld there was absolutely no support for that position
[4:02:53.840 --> 4:03:00.880]  within our department that's homeland security none i wondered is this about security or politics
[4:03:00.880 --> 4:03:07.600]  this is our nation turning into an east german stasi society and now the system doesn't care
[4:03:07.600 --> 4:03:13.200]  i mean wired magazine feds warrantlessly tracking americans credit cards in real time with no warrants
[4:03:13.200 --> 4:03:17.840]  completely illegal they don't care they're announcing it the wall street journal comes out and says is
[4:03:17.840 --> 4:03:23.280]  your video game machine watching you and goes on to admit that the new microsoft connect system
[4:03:23.280 --> 4:03:28.880]  face scans you and has microphones on board and can identify everybody in your home our culture
[4:03:28.880 --> 4:03:34.000]  has been so conditioned to accept big brother that schools in pennsylvania and other states
[4:03:34.000 --> 4:03:38.800]  come right out and say yeah the government issued laptops we give you we're watching you at home
[4:03:38.800 --> 4:03:45.120]  when you're in bed make no mistake this is the story of america's enslavement if we will put up
[4:03:45.120 --> 4:03:50.080]  with this we will go along with anything and notice this is happening as the economy implodes
[4:03:50.080 --> 4:03:54.480]  law enforcement sent my office the homeland security and myac reports over a year and a half ago
[4:03:54.480 --> 4:03:59.920]  where the government's internal documents admit 90 plus percent of homeland security funding is
[4:03:59.920 --> 4:04:06.400]  for gun owners conservatives libertarians returning veterans the big secret is this homeland security
[4:04:06.400 --> 4:04:12.400]  system is for the american people and we had all better come together and defend the bill of rights
[4:04:12.400 --> 4:04:21.360]  and constitution or it's over for our society again it is not my opinion that homeland security
[4:04:21.360 --> 4:04:25.760]  is already on the streets of america and now they've purchased hundreds of high-powered x-ray vans
[4:04:25.760 --> 4:04:30.960]  driving around looking through our walls in our cars that's on record in forbes they've now purchased
[4:04:30.960 --> 4:04:36.800]  dozens of these huge 18 wheeler tractor trailers for football games and music events where homeland
[4:04:36.800 --> 4:04:43.360]  security is going to make you march through these i mean this is total takeover of society
[4:04:44.880 --> 4:04:50.960]  under the future attribute screening technologies or fast program the department of homeland security
[4:04:50.960 --> 4:04:56.560]  is developing innovative physiological and behavioral screening technologies to streamline
[4:04:56.560 --> 4:05:02.960]  the screening process at security checkpoints the mobility of the fast demonstration laboratory
[4:05:02.960 --> 4:05:07.760]  allows security officials to quickly and efficiently establish security boundaries
[4:05:08.400 --> 4:05:14.880]  inside the screening mobile module a suite of real-time non-invasive sensors measure behavioral
[4:05:14.880 --> 4:05:21.600]  and physiological indications of mal intent or the intent or desire to cause harm we've got to stop
[4:05:21.600 --> 4:05:28.800]  conforming to this tyranny we've got to recognize how dangerous it is to our society imagine what's
[4:05:28.800 --> 4:05:41.200]  coming next if we go along with this outrage and one more point if you don't like what walmart's
[4:05:41.200 --> 4:05:45.280]  doing with these telescreens and this whole big brother system call them and let them know
[4:05:45.280 --> 4:05:49.520]  that you're not going to be shopping at their stores until they kick the federal government out

[4:06:24.240 --> 4:06:30.320]  that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages you're a bug mr. wordsworth a crawling insect
[4:06:30.320 --> 4:06:39.280]  ugly misforn little creature who has no purpose here no meaning i am a human being words mr. wordsworth
[4:06:39.840 --> 4:06:46.720]  that have no substance and no dimension like air like the wind i don't care i tell you i don't care
[4:06:47.280 --> 4:06:54.640]  i'm a human being i exist and if i speak one for a loud that thought lives even after i'm
[4:06:54.640 --> 4:07:02.960]  sold in the microwave illusions mr. wordsworth delusions that you eject into your veins to
[4:07:02.960 --> 4:07:07.680]  make you think you have a strength but you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[4:07:07.680 --> 4:07:16.080]  spindly limbs of a dream and the state has no use for your crime resistance to tyrants is
[4:07:16.080 --> 4:07:27.440]  obedience to god it's alex jones it was bertrand russell who said i don't know back in the 30s
[4:07:28.240 --> 4:07:33.840]  and a lot of other ones george bernard shaw and others said that if the state didn't have a use
[4:07:33.840 --> 4:07:40.000]  for you you would be killed they're the ones people who like a big government and always
[4:07:40.000 --> 4:07:44.960]  lecture everybody how they want to take care of us and they they care about us they love us but
[4:07:44.960 --> 4:07:51.200]  the study history it's a lie what a wild evening so far george norrie earlier david ike
[4:07:52.000 --> 4:07:55.760]  who's so spot-on politically and such a great speaker and god i hope he's wrong about
[4:07:56.320 --> 4:08:00.640]  off-world stuff controlling the planet we don't usually get into that subject but david ike such
[4:08:00.640 --> 4:08:04.400]  an icon and the awakening movement that we do have him on i think he's a good soul at the end of the
[4:08:04.400 --> 4:08:10.880]  day mike adams has been here and for the last hour and a half or so and just covered a lot of
[4:08:10.880 --> 4:08:17.600]  amazing information um dealing with the attack on raw milk and uh the demonization now i've seen
[4:08:17.600 --> 4:08:23.920]  them demonizing women that even in public places will cover themselves up give their child sustenance
[4:08:23.920 --> 4:08:31.440]  that's that's evil anything human anything normal anything natural uh is evil and it's it's all part
[4:08:31.440 --> 4:08:37.520]  of the system the power structure waging war on the natural world and it doesn't mean i'm up on
[4:08:37.520 --> 4:08:42.000]  some high horse uh you know mr healthy have all the answers i can recognize what's good and bad
[4:08:42.000 --> 4:08:49.280]  though and it's in that recognizing good from bad that i guess makes us human now coming up always
[4:08:49.280 --> 4:08:54.480]  informative always interesting alfred adask will be joining us to look at the state of the world
[4:08:54.480 --> 4:09:02.080]  today uh we then of course have tex marz joining us always extremely informative uh we have mr
[4:09:02.080 --> 4:09:08.480]  corbett of the corbett report uh joining us spritz spring mire fresh out of prison and then erin dykes
[4:09:08.480 --> 4:09:17.440]  at uh two thirty in the morning takes over and erin's a great guy you know i sent him and do up to um
[4:09:19.040 --> 4:09:22.560]  main to interview charlotte israbe who worked in the fire and service and worked in regga
[4:09:22.560 --> 4:09:28.480]  administration she headed up the department of education as they had a policy number two position
[4:09:28.480 --> 4:09:33.760]  and of course reagan didn't know what was going on he just was a a puppet i mean when something's
[4:09:33.760 --> 4:09:38.160]  that complex that busy i'd probably be president be a puppet just because you can't there's so much
[4:09:38.160 --> 4:09:42.720]  stuff going on unless you tried to get into control of everything and try to look into everything
[4:09:43.440 --> 4:09:49.520]  the point is is that uh she revealed a lot of stuff to us about skull and bones the problem is
[4:09:49.520 --> 4:09:58.000]  erin we've had this interview for probably almost a year now and we did part one do did part one
[4:09:58.000 --> 4:10:02.800]  the first day of interviews about education and was one of the most in-depth she's ever done i know
[4:10:02.800 --> 4:10:08.800]  it's one of her favorite interviews ever and then we put that on prison planet dot tv this one uh is
[4:10:08.800 --> 4:10:15.520]  eight hours and erin for often on for a year in between all his other duties and films and
[4:10:15.520 --> 4:10:22.320]  documentaries and and and short uh news pieces and doing the show and updating the websites gcandlive.com
[4:10:22.320 --> 4:10:28.480]  and also info wars dot com um about a week ago i said yeah we're gonna air that skull and bones
[4:10:28.480 --> 4:10:32.160]  piece gonna have that ready and the thing is he doesn't want to just have the dry interview he
[4:10:32.160 --> 4:10:38.160]  wants to back up everything she's saying he wants to show the documents they spent hours and hours
[4:10:38.160 --> 4:10:42.000]  on top of the eight hour interview filming all the books no one's ever seen internal skull and
[4:10:42.000 --> 4:10:47.520]  bone stuff they've got the grandfather clocks they've got the whole thing you get she's had multiple
[4:10:47.520 --> 4:10:54.160]  family members her dad and others that were spelling bones uh and uh that's coming up in the
[4:10:54.160 --> 4:10:58.560]  early morning hours erin has been up off and on for two days and i told him to that i said let's
[4:10:58.560 --> 4:11:03.200]  just not do this i said let's just wait and put it up on the special report section whenever you
[4:11:03.200 --> 4:11:07.440]  get it done but in a way it's so much stuff it's like a film he'll probably never get it done so
[4:11:07.440 --> 4:11:13.520]  at least something's gonna air at least part of it uh is gonna air uh coming up i think it's 7 a.m
[4:11:13.520 --> 4:11:18.480]  uh so we've got that premiering here we're really excited about that i mean this is some groundbreaking
[4:11:18.480 --> 4:11:25.280]  stuff she's the lady uh who who back in the 80s gave Anthony Sutton the information that blue
[4:11:25.280 --> 4:11:31.920]  skull and bones wide open and now uh the research that uh well she released is is really the blueprint
[4:11:31.920 --> 4:11:36.320]  for what we know about skull and bones and they now admit it's accurate uh because they're again
[4:11:36.320 --> 4:11:40.960]  her dad other family members were members of that uh so that's coming up so that's just some of what
[4:11:40.960 --> 4:11:46.880]  we've got lined up jim marz tomorrow morning uh alan watt jerald salente richard reeves hosting an
[4:11:46.880 --> 4:11:52.480]  hour in the morning uh but i'm gonna go here till two plus in the morning with all these other
[4:11:52.480 --> 4:11:56.960]  guests uh but i wanted to have mike adams for their 15 minutes or so with us because you always
[4:11:56.960 --> 4:12:00.960]  line up a bunch of guests and topics and things that are breaking you want to cover but um
[4:12:01.520 --> 4:12:06.000]  if the assault on whole foods i don't mean the company whole foods but the assault on real food
[4:12:06.000 --> 4:12:11.600]  for those that missed what i was saying this the assault on humanity everything seems to be intensifying
[4:12:12.240 --> 4:12:20.160]  and the new wars the police stay to the censorship of the internet all of this is happening now
[4:12:20.160 --> 4:12:25.280]  why do you think this is happening now mike adams well first of all i want to give a shout out to
[4:12:25.280 --> 4:12:30.480]  your to your crew by the way alex because erin dykes is back they're working his butt off to get
[4:12:30.480 --> 4:12:36.160]  that finished and everybody here is super dedicated and you know for those who who watch your show or
[4:12:36.160 --> 4:12:40.480]  who listen and they don't get the chance to see behind the scenes behind the scenes is really
[4:12:40.480 --> 4:12:45.920]  really intense and people are super dedicated no one is is goofing off around here when i walk around
[4:12:45.920 --> 4:12:51.600]  and and talk to people sometimes they say uh i'm busy i'm working on this film love to talk to you
[4:12:51.600 --> 4:12:56.720]  but uh they're so dedicated so it's incredible but uh in terms of to answer to address your question
[4:12:56.720 --> 4:13:02.480]  alex uh why is this happening now uh why why the acceleration right now i think it's because so many
[4:13:02.480 --> 4:13:09.920]  people are beginning to wake up that the globalists have to up their their own plan of acceleration
[4:13:09.920 --> 4:13:15.040]  you see i think that the globalists had planned to take another hundred years to accomplish all of
[4:13:15.040 --> 4:13:20.640]  this but when they realize that that there are people like you out there or people like david
[4:13:20.640 --> 4:13:25.360]  ike who are really sort of uncovering the patterns and the secrets and raising awareness
[4:13:25.360 --> 4:13:30.960]  that the globalists realize holy cow we don't have a hundred years to make this happen we gotta
[4:13:30.960 --> 4:13:35.520]  we gotta push all of these things now we gotta push gmo's now we gotta push the vaccines aggressively
[4:13:35.520 --> 4:13:41.200]  now and so that's what they're doing and i think they're trying to to accomplish their main goals
[4:13:41.200 --> 4:13:47.840]  one of which is of course total depopulation uh wiping out a big portion of the of the
[4:13:48.560 --> 4:13:54.000]  population of the planet through infertility or other means they want to do that within 10 years
[4:13:54.000 --> 4:13:58.480]  i think or maybe maybe maybe faster i mean i don't i don't know the timeline alex but
[4:13:58.480 --> 4:14:04.560]  well they are going crazy yeah yeah clearly they are going crazy and if you look at the
[4:14:04.560 --> 4:14:09.360]  pushing of the garthassil vaccine it's a classic case of how they are accelerating
[4:14:09.360 --> 4:14:15.040]  well they're flying forward absolutely they are because they've been caught red-handed
[4:14:15.040 --> 4:14:21.600]  but they can't say oh we've been caught the the the vaccine is harmful to girls instead they say
[4:14:21.600 --> 4:14:27.680]  well now let's push it on boys well now let's attack dr wakefield now let's discreetly spin it
[4:14:27.680 --> 4:14:33.040]  they go it's boys that give it to the girls they're bad so now they get it like it's a punishment
[4:14:33.040 --> 4:14:39.120]  you did it didn't you this will help you yeah it's pretty sick some some of some of what's
[4:14:39.120 --> 4:14:44.000]  going on in their heads it's pretty sick and in fact your interview and david ike brought this up
[4:14:44.000 --> 4:14:49.840]  where david mentioned that what has been removed from those bloodlines is a sense of human empathy
[4:14:49.840 --> 4:14:56.720]  they literally cannot feel for another child or feel how another person might feel i think it's
[4:14:56.720 --> 4:15:00.960]  worse than it's not that they don't even feel they enjoy hurting them yeah you know i disagree with
[4:15:00.960 --> 4:15:06.720]  david they actually enjoy it i heard that video last week they got censored on youtube and stuff
[4:15:06.720 --> 4:15:11.360]  of the little three-year-old girl with a whole bottom jaw blown off i couldn't even listen to your
[4:15:11.360 --> 4:15:17.840]  show uh that when you went into that i had to fact that haunts me oh my gosh that was truly
[4:15:17.840 --> 4:15:22.800]  horrifying stuff but maybe there is an element out there that they true well there must be because
[4:15:22.800 --> 4:15:27.280]  you look at what they do with children i mean you look at child protective services and you've
[4:15:27.280 --> 4:15:32.320]  covered this and how some of those children end up you know disappearing well they don't just disappear
[4:15:32.880 --> 4:15:39.040]  they're taken somewhere oh it's been confirmed we we have allowed through national security and
[4:15:39.040 --> 4:15:44.720]  all these secretive systems to allow the worst of elements of society to just just do whatever they
[4:15:44.720 --> 4:15:52.080]  want it's really frightening also to look at the way the population allows it to happen
[4:15:52.080 --> 4:15:58.080]  when it's someone allows the tsa to do all that without speaking out ever someone just says oh
[4:15:58.080 --> 4:16:02.240]  it's fine i feel safer now because they're they're feeling my junk and feeling my breast whatever
[4:16:02.960 --> 4:16:11.360]  that that allowance of it that that that mental acceptance of that kind of violation of human
[4:16:11.360 --> 4:16:19.120]  boundaries that is what is the the doorway to more tyranny well it says we're all guilty too
[4:16:19.120 --> 4:16:23.840]  it's this idea of there's no due process there's no nothing and so they're expanding out to the
[4:16:23.840 --> 4:16:29.280]  streets there yeah that's the other side the no due process that's that's really frightening when
[4:16:29.280 --> 4:16:36.160]  you've got a president whose advisors create a a kill list you know the white house openly admits
[4:16:36.160 --> 4:16:42.800]  this they have a kill list uh these are american citizens to kill without due process uh even if
[4:16:42.800 --> 4:16:47.920]  you think they are a terrorist or even if you think they did something you know it is a principle
[4:16:47.920 --> 4:16:53.920]  of basic justice that every accuser can can can face their uh i mean i'm sorry every person accused
[4:16:53.920 --> 4:16:58.880]  can face their accuser and can can face the charges and the accuser gets to face as well
[4:16:58.880 --> 4:17:03.760]  exactly and they they could that they should be able to have uh the opportunity now they've
[4:17:03.760 --> 4:17:08.240]  totally turned over our system and now all the liberty all the freedom all the blessings
[4:17:08.240 --> 4:17:13.920]  it's going out the window and the system's answer is more corruption that will that will deliver you
[4:17:13.920 --> 4:17:20.640]  to valhalla and and yet right now with these these occupy protests that we see and you've
[4:17:20.640 --> 4:17:26.480]  covered all how it's a mixed bag and how the uh some of the the the interventionists are trying
[4:17:26.480 --> 4:17:32.240]  to hijack it for their own purposes but when you get down to the core of it enough people are
[4:17:32.240 --> 4:17:36.480]  frustrated right now to really take to the streets and i think that's going to accelerate
[4:17:36.480 --> 4:17:40.560]  i mean david i talked about this a little bit what what do you think alex where where do you
[4:17:40.560 --> 4:17:45.360]  think it's going in the next uh six months you know a lot of people talk about 2012 it's right
[4:17:45.360 --> 4:17:49.760]  around the corner what what do you think's going to happen next year with with the occupy protests
[4:17:49.760 --> 4:17:54.800]  if they continue through the christmas season well i mean look the system knew there was about to
[4:17:54.800 --> 4:18:00.160]  be a big rebellion against what they were doing they could track all that uh with their algorithms
[4:18:00.160 --> 4:18:05.120]  all the data they're spying on together so they tried to trigger it they tried to then co-opt but
[4:18:05.120 --> 4:18:09.600]  that didn't work so now they're cracking heads all over the country and clearly this country
[4:18:09.600 --> 4:18:14.480]  isn't a depression i mean you know here we are having the fourth annual money bomb i wouldn't
[4:18:14.480 --> 4:18:19.760]  even promote these things the first one we did four years ago i'd raised $300,000 and you know
[4:18:19.760 --> 4:18:26.960]  last year i promoted it some and raised $437,000 this year i promoted it some and we've raised a
[4:18:26.960 --> 4:18:32.800]  lot less this far into the 27 hour broadcast than we normally would because the country is in a
[4:18:32.800 --> 4:18:38.000]  depression uh and uh i fully understand that that's why i've tried to create all these different
[4:18:38.000 --> 4:18:42.720]  revenue streams so we can stay at the level we are and hopefully expand a little bit in the face
[4:18:42.720 --> 4:18:48.480]  of globalists because because we do have an effect on them i mean i mean we had janet apolitano come
[4:18:48.480 --> 4:18:53.760]  out uh just a few months ago and complain about you know matt drudge and the articles he was linking
[4:18:53.760 --> 4:19:01.760]  to about tsa it's it's definitely getting to them it's definitely having an effect on them
[4:19:02.320 --> 4:19:07.920]  and i mean again most revolutionaries in history rob banks to get their money we sell books and
[4:19:07.920 --> 4:19:12.720]  videos and dvds and have radio sponsors so we're not revolutionaries we're restorationists we want
[4:19:12.720 --> 4:19:18.000]  liberty and freedom back which is a new idea compared to the old tyranny we're uh basically
[4:19:18.000 --> 4:19:22.720]  going under so in a way i am a revolutionary or renaissance person uh what's really interesting
[4:19:22.720 --> 4:19:27.840]  about about what you're doing here is you are the reluctant fundraiser at these events you know
[4:19:27.840 --> 4:19:33.600]  you're never about the money you've never been about that not not behind the scenes not a person
[4:19:33.600 --> 4:19:38.240]  to person conversations not on the air nothing for you you you know you're so mission driven
[4:19:38.240 --> 4:19:45.360]  but you but the money has there's an infrastructure that's got to be uh uh fed in a way you know and
[4:19:45.360 --> 4:19:50.480]  and right now dollars are the only way that either one of us can see sure sure exactly the globalists
[4:19:50.480 --> 4:19:55.840]  will get us to kill our grandma for a stick of bubble gum and do anything for just fiat garbage
[4:19:55.840 --> 4:20:00.240]  and people say well then why do you want fellow reserve notes because that's the symbol of energy
[4:20:00.240 --> 4:20:05.760]  that's what funds this and i'll be honest with you four years ago i was not about the money
[4:20:05.760 --> 4:20:10.880]  because i had five six crew members and we were just going to keep having a little simple dinky
[4:20:10.880 --> 4:20:15.840]  websites and maybe an article a day and some stuff we posted and a couple films a year in the radio
[4:20:15.840 --> 4:20:21.200]  show and people are always do this do that have this idea and you know what i realized
[4:20:21.200 --> 4:20:25.040]  instead of being angry at folks always telling me to do more they're right because we were already
[4:20:25.040 --> 4:20:31.600]  reaching millions a week then we had a responsibility and since i've tried to expand uh four years ago
[4:20:31.600 --> 4:20:36.560]  and have and i got 30 plus people working for us in a lot bigger office in a nightly new show and
[4:20:36.560 --> 4:20:42.400]  and reports every day and reporters we're probably having four or five times the effect i was or more
[4:20:42.400 --> 4:20:48.240]  i was having five years ago and so now it's not it almost becomes a game because i have to make
[4:20:48.240 --> 4:20:52.480]  something interesting and fun to do it to go out and get the sponsors and make sure that the right
[4:20:52.480 --> 4:20:57.520]  sponsors and to go out and raise the money and make the films and and you know products i like
[4:20:57.520 --> 4:21:03.120]  and then promote them show i mean it does become an issue of but also becomes an issue of people
[4:21:03.120 --> 4:21:08.880]  don't keep their job which is also an important mission people i've recruited people i've trained
[4:21:08.880 --> 4:21:13.680]  structure i've built if we don't get the blood supply to them and it's the viewers out there
[4:21:13.680 --> 4:21:18.720]  that supply that by spreading the word i mean look going back three four years ago before we
[4:21:18.720 --> 4:21:25.200]  hit the total depression as audience went up revenue followed it exactly now audience is
[4:21:25.200 --> 4:21:32.400]  going like that like a fighter jet going straight up just okay audience is just like a rocket going
[4:21:32.400 --> 4:21:40.240]  into orbit but audience is going like that but the last three years revenue is tracking it yeah
[4:21:40.240 --> 4:21:44.800]  yeah so it's not tracking it so that's how i knew i was in a depression three years ago i've never
[4:21:44.800 --> 4:21:49.200]  seen anything like this people i i looked at all the actuaries talk to the economist and and now
[4:21:49.200 --> 4:21:53.840]  they admit it's the greatest recession triple debt no i mean by every measure that's a depression so
[4:21:53.840 --> 4:21:58.560]  i understand that that's why i've shed on air we will continue to operate if this money bomb isn't
[4:21:58.560 --> 4:22:03.120]  as big a success as the others because i've done other funding mechanisms for at the time being
[4:22:03.680 --> 4:22:08.000]  yeah but but but it becomes a thing of like a drought as a tree's got deep roots so
[4:22:08.000 --> 4:22:12.880]  even an drought it can live but if it but it doesn't it doesn't flower as much as it would
[4:22:12.880 --> 4:22:18.720]  we need people to a spread the word about the free video streams up at info wars.com we need people
[4:22:18.720 --> 4:22:24.480]  but not and i'll say this again if you're a old lady or old man on social security because those
[4:22:24.480 --> 4:22:27.760]  are always the folks that actually try to give i do not want your money i've had people coming
[4:22:27.760 --> 4:22:31.280]  to be in crowds you know like a blind man with like five hundred dollars he said this is half the
[4:22:31.280 --> 4:22:35.200]  money i'm going to have the next month here it is i stuck it back in his pocket you know because
[4:22:35.200 --> 4:22:40.560]  those are people that have hearts and souls they're giving this thing but then i if i took that money
[4:22:40.560 --> 4:22:45.520]  when i bought a new pair of shoes i'd feel dirty or or when i you know put gas in my car or when i
[4:22:45.520 --> 4:22:50.560]  bought the crude pizza you know i don't want to listen there's plenty of people out there
[4:22:50.560 --> 4:22:55.520]  that are middle-class or wealthy and you're the exact types that sit on the money and because you
[4:22:55.520 --> 4:22:59.280]  do that the globalists are going to raise taxes take everything you got i mean you either do like
[4:22:59.280 --> 4:23:05.120]  the founders did and others have done you either invest and i and don't invest here get my films
[4:23:05.120 --> 4:23:09.360]  or other films whatever you make a copies but my films you can make copies of start your own
[4:23:09.360 --> 4:23:14.800]  website start your own local radio show start your own access tv show you just better do something
[4:23:14.800 --> 4:23:20.560]  and i'm telling you one of the best places bang for the buck to support is info wars info wars.com
[4:23:20.560 --> 4:23:26.000]  info wars moneybomb.com right now it's happening right now and i see the donations the average
[4:23:26.000 --> 4:23:30.800]  donation coming in it's about twelve dollars you know uh we need to see the people that have made
[4:23:30.800 --> 4:23:36.880]  the moneybomb successful in the past ten thousand twenty thousand you're the people that that that
[4:23:36.880 --> 4:23:41.760]  your donation is going to have the big effect uh mike you have any comments on that yeah i do
[4:23:41.760 --> 4:23:48.800]  actually uh it's interesting we have a similar experience in running uh organizations uh our
[4:23:48.800 --> 4:23:53.440]  organization for the first five years of its existence we didn't even take sponsors at all
[4:23:54.000 --> 4:23:59.360]  and that's the same thing we couldn't survive i mean we could not survive we were losing money
[4:23:59.360 --> 4:24:03.920]  for the for the first several years i actually put money into it because i have a background in
[4:24:03.920 --> 4:24:08.960]  the software industry so i was taking money out of that and dumping it into what what later
[4:24:08.960 --> 4:24:13.440]  became natural news is losing money every day and and then we had people just like you have
[4:24:13.440 --> 4:24:16.800]  who came to us and said you got to cover this story oh my gosh look at what's happening over here
[4:24:16.800 --> 4:24:21.760]  with the the cdc or this vaccine or that pharmaceutical or whatever and you get to a point
[4:24:21.760 --> 4:24:27.840]  where you say we have a moral obligation to cover these stories but we don't have the funds to do it
[4:24:27.840 --> 4:24:32.480]  so the answer you don't even have a crew to ship products or books you don't have people do research
[4:24:32.480 --> 4:24:37.600]  you don't have the money for a building or cameras or equipment i mean it's simple the government
[4:24:37.600 --> 4:24:44.480]  takes your money and gives it to globalist operations and msnbc and and and and mpr we're
[4:24:44.480 --> 4:24:50.560]  here just saying you know buy the products buy the books whatever that's exactly it and then
[4:24:50.560 --> 4:24:57.280]  once we began to take sponsors then we really exploded in our ability to cover news you probably
[4:24:57.280 --> 4:25:01.760]  saw that you probably saw that happen in our history uh where where we're able to hire more
[4:25:01.760 --> 4:25:07.040]  reporters better investigators to put more money into a story no the globalists they they they're
[4:25:07.040 --> 4:25:10.960]  all about being big and powerful that's why they always demonize any political activists
[4:25:10.960 --> 4:25:16.320]  that are outside the globalist paradigm ever even selling products i used to give all my films away
[4:25:16.320 --> 4:25:20.720]  100 free you did and then the minute i started even selling them to find myself oh that's evil
[4:25:21.920 --> 4:25:27.120]  well you know some of that is just the the trolls out there the obvious trolls who are always poking
[4:25:27.120 --> 4:25:30.640]  you know criticizing everything doesn't matter they don't really matter they're irrelevant they're
[4:25:30.640 --> 4:25:36.000]  hired trolls uh what what matters is that your viewers and people who are watching this and the
[4:25:36.000 --> 4:25:41.360]  people who are offering their donations right now at info wars money bomb dot com uh these are the
[4:25:41.360 --> 4:25:47.120]  people who who get it they are the loyalists in the in the sense of they understand the importance
[4:25:47.120 --> 4:25:56.880]  of freedom in the press in the new media you are you are a a a massively uh a wave making giant in
[4:25:56.880 --> 4:26:03.040]  the new media and it's crucial that you continue to have the resources that you need to pursue this
[4:26:03.040 --> 4:26:08.160]  even further because it's only begun i mean the acceleration that we talked about has only begun
[4:26:09.200 --> 4:26:14.400]  imagine where this is going to be in 12 months imagine how much more news you're going to need
[4:26:14.400 --> 4:26:18.000]  to cover you're going to need that room back there where kurt nemo sits you're going to need
[4:26:18.000 --> 4:26:23.280]  you know a couple more people and well that's the thing is that we got this 7500 square foot building
[4:26:23.840 --> 4:26:27.840]  with the money bomb two money bombs ago and we sort of built the infrastructure and there
[4:26:27.840 --> 4:26:32.160]  wasn't room and then we two years ago got the other side but they didn't have money to hire
[4:26:32.160 --> 4:26:36.480]  the people to fill it and build the studio now that's done you've been over there yeah yeah i mean
[4:26:36.480 --> 4:26:42.880]  this is a 16 000 almost 16 000 square foot deal we've got room for another 20 people uh you're
[4:26:42.880 --> 4:26:48.880]  cramming i mean we got easy room for another 10 but i'm just trying to hire five and at the same
[4:26:48.880 --> 4:26:53.200]  time we need to have a little money back up if i get sued or attacked globalist analyze our entire
[4:26:53.200 --> 4:26:58.400]  deal of course they do i've got to be able to defend things that's my mission i've told my wife i said
[4:26:58.400 --> 4:27:03.520]  we will sell our house if it ever she's absolutely she's always like we should sell everything now and
[4:27:03.520 --> 4:27:08.880]  live in a ditch to fight these people and i'm like no we've got to have some reserves here you know
[4:27:08.880 --> 4:27:14.720]  building up for a war we've got to do this but um there's nothing wrong with having a having a roof
[4:27:14.720 --> 4:27:19.760]  over your head no but my point is is we actually dream about other people coming forward that are
[4:27:19.760 --> 4:27:24.160]  light years better than i am like like like you might in certain respects so that i can just step
[4:27:24.160 --> 4:27:29.680]  back and you know move out to a ranch somewhere we got family land and stuff and and literally
[4:27:29.680 --> 4:27:34.720]  like you know you got donkeys and stuff and have a farm yeah i mean i do not i enjoy fighting tyranny
[4:27:34.720 --> 4:27:39.440]  but the problem is once you get into this it's all encompassing it is you know i'm up here 10
[4:27:39.440 --> 4:27:43.920]  o'clock every night uh you know on the news crew we've set all this up we're beta testing it getting
[4:27:43.920 --> 4:27:47.840]  it ready it's already reaching a lot of folks but we have barely enough people to even do it every
[4:27:47.840 --> 4:27:53.600]  night we need a couple more just so people can rest sometimes you know it's kind of like a race car
[4:27:53.600 --> 4:27:57.280]  team where they've got the engine and the parts and they put the car on the field with one set of
[4:27:57.280 --> 4:28:02.880]  tires and that's what we've got and the tires are bald and about to blow the engine smoking we're
[4:28:02.880 --> 4:28:08.880]  winning the race but i'm like hey we need a replacement parts we need more fuel we need tires
[4:28:08.880 --> 4:28:13.680]  we need everything i mean we can you know do this on the cheap's and and i guess if you know the
[4:28:13.680 --> 4:28:18.160]  economy keeps going into oppression see i wanted to outgrow the depression i saw this coming three
[4:28:18.160 --> 4:28:23.280]  four years ago i wanted to be up front to be at a bigger platform to face them we're now here
[4:28:23.280 --> 4:28:28.320]  but we're sinking as fast as everything else sinks just because we were ahead of the curve
[4:28:28.320 --> 4:28:33.760]  we're like an island but still the island's sinking as well well i i i think that as things begin
[4:28:33.760 --> 4:28:41.680]  to unravel out there every milestone event that takes place proves info wars and you
[4:28:41.680 --> 4:28:47.120]  to be correct because so much of this you saw in the plans you talked about you saw it coming out
[4:28:47.120 --> 4:28:52.880]  not by any psychic means just by analyzing it like you talked about but as as that begins to
[4:28:52.880 --> 4:28:59.120]  happen more and more people will come to info wars and whatever future news efforts you have
[4:28:59.120 --> 4:29:03.120]  underway they will get more and more attention so you'll be able i mean i think the resources will
[4:29:03.120 --> 4:29:07.840]  come to you because people are increasingly realizing that you're right you've been right
[4:29:08.480 --> 4:29:13.040]  you are you're on the record being right it's not you know it's not pulling it out of the air
[4:29:13.040 --> 4:29:20.400]  oh he was right no go back and watch the videos right go back and and even from before 9 11 you
[4:29:20.400 --> 4:29:26.960]  know go back and watch it so as people wake up they are turning away from the mainstream media
[4:29:26.960 --> 4:29:32.320]  and they are turning to the new media i agree but it's going to be the counter strike to censor us
[4:29:32.320 --> 4:29:36.880]  and you and others yeah there's going to be other attacks you know that we already see happening
[4:29:36.880 --> 4:29:40.720]  things that have happened before that we didn't really talk about but but you know all this is
[4:29:40.720 --> 4:29:46.880]  going on and so that's why i'm really glad and proud and and honored and and you know satisfied
[4:29:46.880 --> 4:29:52.480]  in all this work that we did see the storm coming we did prepare to get stronger and bigger in the
[4:29:52.480 --> 4:29:58.800]  face of it now i see the next bigger wave coming and you know that's the issue people have to decide
[4:29:58.800 --> 4:30:02.960]  what they're going to do what they're going to support because so many people say yeah you woke
[4:30:02.960 --> 4:30:08.000]  me up now i'm moving on to take care of myself or whatever as if other people aren't awake yet
[4:30:08.000 --> 4:30:12.480]  a lot of people are ready to be awakened but they're not really awake yet and that's why
[4:30:12.480 --> 4:30:17.920]  our greatest work is ahead and that's why spread the word about info wars.com about naturalnews.com
[4:30:17.920 --> 4:30:22.000]  it is you know that's why i like mike adams because i've known him a few years down interviewing
[4:30:22.000 --> 4:30:25.760]  for many years but he's been here in austin for a while gotten to know him i can tell he's on
[4:30:25.760 --> 4:30:31.840]  egomaniac or a crazy person so many people so many people myself included i'm a crazy person
[4:30:31.840 --> 4:30:37.200]  on egomaniac living here you know working with other people it's like they don't like tyranny
[4:30:37.200 --> 4:30:42.320]  but they also kind of it's like a oh this is fun we're like celebrities this is not about that this
[4:30:42.320 --> 4:30:46.800]  is about work this is about research it's about dedication it's about doing the right thing
[4:30:46.800 --> 4:30:52.080]  it's about not compromising in the face of fear you know i'm like you i'd rather be on my farm
[4:30:52.720 --> 4:31:00.240]  i'd rather be literally planting potatoes or something i'd rather be i've got chickens out
[4:31:00.240 --> 4:31:04.640]  there i've got donkeys out there i'd rather be on a tractor frankly frankly practicing
[4:31:04.640 --> 4:31:08.800]  perm much human that's what you're supposed to do well yeah yeah i mean i mean you see what i drive
[4:31:08.800 --> 4:31:15.040]  you know you see what i wear this is not an act uh this is my ranch shirt as well i mean
[4:31:15.600 --> 4:31:19.200]  but i see you as the same way too i see you as authentic you know behind the scenes off the
[4:31:19.200 --> 4:31:25.360]  camera you're the same guy that that you portray yourself unfortunately well but that's people
[4:31:25.360 --> 4:31:30.720]  want authenticity they don't want a bunch of fakers up there and people are tired of the fakers
[4:31:30.720 --> 4:31:35.840]  you know and and if someone comes to my house and they look at my pantry or my kitchen they're
[4:31:35.840 --> 4:31:39.760]  going to see me eating the same foods that i that i advise well i'll say this you actually
[4:31:39.760 --> 4:31:43.760]  walk your walk i'm still super unhealthy but trying to get healthy i've i've started to turn the
[4:31:43.760 --> 4:31:49.040]  ship you know it takes all the stuff is dicting once you get deep into this evil food you know
[4:31:49.040 --> 4:31:54.800]  it's it you are doing fantastic and your crew to erin back there he looks like 50 pounds he looks
[4:31:54.800 --> 4:31:59.120]  better well pretty soon gonna blow away but it didn't look healthy he's gonna be on here like with
[4:31:59.120 --> 4:32:04.240]  with russian kettlebells and and lifting weights pretty soon probably i mean the guy well he actually
[4:32:04.240 --> 4:32:08.960]  listens to you and been fuchs and he actually put it into function and i know it's i say 50
[4:32:08.960 --> 4:32:13.040]  pounds i mean the guy he was not super fat but he was kind of like me husky you know how to belly
[4:32:13.040 --> 4:32:18.000]  it's all gone it's it's it's we even ordered food tonight he's like well no i've got my own food
[4:32:18.000 --> 4:32:22.000]  and he drank your uh and not that our stuff wasn't healthy it's cobble balls but i mean he kind of
[4:32:22.000 --> 4:32:26.000]  drank your your uh your juicing you gave him and by the way i like the fact you've got your whole
[4:32:26.000 --> 4:32:30.320]  trough there you're saving that for your donkeys yeah what's left to give him the whole office juice
[4:32:30.320 --> 4:32:35.360]  that's right nothing goes to waste we uh we made the juice for your crew and then we take the pulp
[4:32:35.360 --> 4:32:39.920]  back and give that to the donkeys or the chickens tonight if i didn't have animals like that i would
[4:32:39.920 --> 4:32:44.400]  compost it right and put it in the those are some healthy animals i bet they're really healthy yeah
[4:32:44.400 --> 4:32:50.720]  the donkeys are rescue donkeys we rescued them um i don't want to talk about what happened to them
[4:32:50.720 --> 4:32:55.200]  before because it's not not kind that sounds kind of al-qaeda-ish yeah i guess no but so they were all
[4:32:55.200 --> 4:33:00.160]  locked up not getting fed they were they were uh they had been beaten basically some you know
[4:33:00.160 --> 4:33:05.600]  someone had beaten these donkeys and they were scared of of humans and we it took us months
[4:33:05.600 --> 4:33:09.920]  before they would even approach us and now we can we can be right next to them we can pat them we
[4:33:09.920 --> 4:33:14.080]  can touch them and but it's just a little microcosm of what's going on in the world and i love donkeys
[4:33:14.080 --> 4:33:21.440]  they're such sweet creatures the leers ours are mischievous little i'm telling you they they they
[4:33:21.440 --> 4:33:25.840]  move stuff around on you so you wake up the next morning and and you thought you had a bucket over
[4:33:25.840 --> 4:33:31.120]  there or a trough over there now it's 600 yards away that's the donkeys what are their names uh
[4:33:31.120 --> 4:33:36.400]  jackson and jennifer they're smart yeah yeah they're smart donkeys but thanks for having me on i
[4:33:36.400 --> 4:33:41.920]  really i i enjoy being here i really support what you're doing and and we had a great segment
[4:33:41.920 --> 4:33:47.120]  and you know donkeys are like uh like a watchdog you know once you get them they'll actually run off
[4:33:47.120 --> 4:33:52.640]  wolves coyotes they'll actually uh you know a nay or ninny or whatever it is a donkey does
[4:33:52.640 --> 4:33:58.640]  people come around yeah they they do the we have coyotes out there we've got all kinds of of creatures
[4:33:58.640 --> 4:34:05.040]  owls and rattlesnakes and coyotes and of course the wild feral pigs that are out there too i've
[4:34:05.040 --> 4:34:09.680]  come across groups of 30 of those at a time you gotta blast those those are a feral invasive
[4:34:09.680 --> 4:34:14.480]  species and they'll take over those will eat those eat baby deer and stuff you know right i
[4:34:14.480 --> 4:34:18.880]  everybody else shoots them i alex i don't have the heart to shoot them you know um but everybody
[4:34:18.880 --> 4:34:23.360]  else does and i understand the reasons for doing that i mean i mean obviously a pigs one of the
[4:34:23.360 --> 4:34:28.960]  smartest animals out there but the thing is they're out of control yeah it's like a scourge of locust
[4:34:28.960 --> 4:34:33.760]  clearly but i just i just can't i just can't do that i can you know i can shoot a rattlesnake
[4:34:33.760 --> 4:34:39.680]  if it's attacking our our chickens you know that's for me i can do that but uh the pigs aren't
[4:34:39.680 --> 4:34:44.480]  aren't hurting any of our animals so i you know if i were a cattle rancher i'm sure i would have a
[4:34:44.480 --> 4:34:50.480]  different view on that they're gonna attack your crops well uh we're gonna we're gonna have a solar
[4:34:50.480 --> 4:34:56.560]  powered electric fences around our food to keep them out little little zap reminder for those pigs
[4:34:56.560 --> 4:35:02.320]  that's not gonna keep them you're probably right alex but i i just i know these these things
[4:35:02.320 --> 4:35:07.040]  they're these are i mean let me tell you pigs are bad news i would only pull their eating baby

[4:43:02.720 --> 4:43:07.360]  with a few breaks from my live broadcasting with other live folks like mike adams here for the last
[4:43:07.360 --> 4:43:15.280]  two hours uh we have got uh tex mars coming up jim mars coming up um jerald salunte great job
[4:43:15.280 --> 4:43:19.440]  with the crew lining all these folks up now i didn't do a pre interview with alfreda daskin
[4:43:19.440 --> 4:43:23.600]  the last two interviews he's a great guy he's absolutely on target about the elite in their
[4:43:23.600 --> 4:43:27.840]  own legal filing saying we're animals and they're humans and so we deserve to be treated like this
[4:43:27.840 --> 4:43:33.760]  that's the globalist eugenicist program uh and when he did the tv show with erin he covered that
[4:43:33.760 --> 4:43:39.120]  and it's fine if he does that preface you know his his his research but i want to i want to
[4:43:39.120 --> 4:43:44.560]  pick his brain about the larger agendas and fighting this system in the spirit of fighting
[4:43:44.560 --> 4:43:49.840]  because he's such an articulate really powerful person powerful spirit of liberty and he's right
[4:43:49.840 --> 4:43:55.120]  here hailing from up in the dallas fort worth area as well so many great resistance fighters
[4:43:55.120 --> 4:44:00.560]  against dehumanization coming from the great state of texas not that people that people texas were
[4:44:00.560 --> 4:44:06.560]  perfect uh but they certainly were rebels against tyranny uh and you know of course my family goes
[4:44:06.560 --> 4:44:12.240]  way back to the founding of texas uh in texas lore so ridiculously texan i won't even go over it all
[4:44:12.240 --> 4:44:17.600]  it's sounds like a storybook and my family goes back on both sides of the mayflower including
[4:44:17.600 --> 4:44:22.800]  the captain of the mayflower uh and mile standish and others but you know this is what america's
[4:44:22.800 --> 4:44:27.040]  all about and that's why the globalists have come here and taken it over because this engine of
[4:44:27.040 --> 4:44:31.920]  liberty not perfect but the greatest example of liberty compared to any other country this created
[4:44:31.920 --> 4:44:38.640]  great wealth and power so the parasites came here to take it over and alfred adaske joins us will

[4:45:24.080 --> 4:45:28.880]  alfred adaske great to have you with us hi alex i thank you for that it's pretty flattering
[4:45:28.880 --> 4:45:35.920]  introduction um probably a little more exaggeration there than it needs to be total ball i can feel
[4:45:35.920 --> 4:45:43.360]  your soul of liberty well that's well a bit powerful is not necessarily that that word i'm not i don't
[4:45:43.360 --> 4:45:48.400]  know that that one applies but i'm dedicated to what i'm doing i've been at it for 28 years and
[4:45:48.400 --> 4:45:55.440]  what started me was a divorce back in 1983 and i lost custody of my children and what i regarded
[4:45:55.440 --> 4:46:00.480]  as a great injustice and that's what started me on the path up until then my background was about
[4:46:00.480 --> 4:46:05.920]  25 years construction work i had a little roofing business at the point in time when this broke
[4:46:05.920 --> 4:46:11.040]  loose and i became a student of the legal system i thought i'd correct that injustice on the child
[4:46:11.040 --> 4:46:17.680]  custody battle i never did but once you got into it it just seemed to take you you know you just
[4:46:17.680 --> 4:46:22.320]  move and move from one thing to another to another and next thing you know i was published in a
[4:46:22.320 --> 4:46:27.360]  magazine called the antishyster and doing little radio programs and uh you get into it and what
[4:46:27.360 --> 4:46:34.240]  else you know it's it becomes an obsession you can't lay it down it's one of these things i know
[4:46:34.240 --> 4:46:38.480]  you've got the same problem and i heard you were talking on the previous in the previous segment
[4:46:38.480 --> 4:46:43.440]  where you'd like to be able to kind of go out to the ranch for a while all right and just watch the
[4:46:43.440 --> 4:46:51.040]  donkeys or whatever pretty hard to do once you get into this i don't know that you can walk away
[4:46:51.040 --> 4:46:54.880]  you know i don't even know that you can relax and i have the same thing there's part of me
[4:46:54.880 --> 4:47:00.080]  i would like nothing better to go out and do some surf fishing i'd like to be living on a
[4:47:00.080 --> 4:47:04.400]  beach where i could just go out there just you know cast out and catch a couple of fish and
[4:47:04.400 --> 4:47:11.920]  rest that cook them up for dinner the idea of break and loose from this obsession
[4:47:13.760 --> 4:47:20.160]  this this calling all right well it's attractive but i know but i don't believe i could do it
[4:47:20.160 --> 4:47:24.400]  and i doubt that you can't either you can get out on that you can get that ranch if you want to
[4:47:24.400 --> 4:47:31.040]  but you'll be back you understand and probably not very long i think the most recent thing you
[4:47:31.040 --> 4:47:40.000]  mentioned it before and the most important thing uh got i became involved in a lawsuit in 2006 i was
[4:47:40.000 --> 4:47:45.520]  added as the last of seven defendants in a case that involved the manufacturing distribution of a
[4:47:45.520 --> 4:47:51.360]  controlled substance the controlled substance was colloidal silver uh but it's the same law
[4:47:51.360 --> 4:47:57.200]  that they would apply with heroin and cocaine and it's a part of the drug laws it was a civil
[4:47:57.200 --> 4:48:02.720]  prosecution by the attorney general of state of texas and they added me as a defendant i was
[4:48:02.720 --> 4:48:07.200]  fiduciary for a trust aid the trust was a defendant they made me a defendant and they're
[4:48:07.200 --> 4:48:12.320]  suing every defendant including me for twenty five thousand dollars a day that's nine million
[4:48:12.320 --> 4:48:17.840]  dollars a year i guarantee i don't have that kind of money and it sharpens your attention
[4:48:17.840 --> 4:48:22.800]  quite a bit to be sued for that especially by the attorney general of state of texas i started
[4:48:22.800 --> 4:48:28.960]  reading the relevant law and i'm a student of the bible and i have an understanding of the
[4:48:28.960 --> 4:48:34.320]  declaration of independence and fundamental principles and i was just shocked i read the law
[4:48:34.320 --> 4:48:40.800]  and the definition of drugs presumes the people to be animals and when i first saw the when i first
[4:48:40.800 --> 4:48:44.720]  saw the language i thought my god these damn fools they don't even know what they're writing
[4:48:44.720 --> 4:48:49.680]  and then i saw it a second time and then i saw it two more times in the federal law first i found
[4:48:49.680 --> 4:48:53.920]  it in the texas law then i found it in the federal law and we found it in 23 separate laws and
[4:48:53.920 --> 4:48:59.280]  regulations that applied in our case and it's abundantly clear that the government has been
[4:48:59.280 --> 4:49:05.680]  treating the people as animals this is the foundation of our war on drugs the war on drugs
[4:49:05.680 --> 4:49:11.280]  laid the foundation for much of the modern police state the police state gives us the prison industrial
[4:49:11.280 --> 4:49:18.480]  complex and all of this is balanced on a couple of little definitions of drugs and medical devices
[4:49:18.480 --> 4:49:23.920]  that presume the people to be animals we traced this back we found it in five states besides texas
[4:49:23.920 --> 4:49:29.680]  and the federal law i presume it's true in all 50 states the earliest instance we can find that this
[4:49:29.680 --> 4:49:38.000]  is 1906 in the pure food and drug act first time that we've been able to find that they they first
[4:49:38.000 --> 4:49:43.680]  referred to the people as animals they've been doing this for a century you understand this isn't
[4:49:43.680 --> 4:49:48.240]  a new thing this isn't something that just happened in the last you know a couple of years they have
[4:49:48.240 --> 4:49:54.160]  been regarding the people as animals for a century we've found it in title seven which is the code of
[4:49:54.160 --> 4:50:00.960]  agriculture they define animals to include human men and women again we found it in title 28 relative
[4:50:00.960 --> 4:50:07.360]  to drug laws and medical devices and i don't know where else it exists but the fact that it exists
[4:50:07.360 --> 4:50:14.640]  anywhere is intolerable because and this was the basis of our defense i drafted a defense again
[4:50:14.640 --> 4:50:20.720]  student of the bible i understand that a genesis 126 through 28 it says on the sixth day god created
[4:50:20.720 --> 4:50:28.240]  man in his image and gave man dominion over the animals my bible says that i can't be an animal
[4:50:28.880 --> 4:50:33.040]  and i've got a constitution that has a first amendment that says you can't interfere with
[4:50:33.040 --> 4:50:39.040]  my freedom of religion so if you've got a law that says i'm an animal i got a bible it says no i'm
[4:50:39.040 --> 4:50:46.080]  not guess what you got a problem you can't make that stand in court and for what it's worth so far
[4:50:46.080 --> 4:50:51.920]  as i know i'm the first man in a century to read that law and realize what it meant certainly the
[4:50:51.920 --> 4:50:56.400]  first layman there's probably an absurd they've been a handful of lawyers and politicians who
[4:50:56.400 --> 4:51:00.640]  understood it but most people they don't even read the law and understand what it means we
[4:51:00.640 --> 4:51:05.600]  drafted a religious freedom defense the attorney general went dead silent for five months and they
[4:51:05.600 --> 4:51:09.920]  came back spent five months trying to settle a case and then they just dropped the case after
[4:51:09.920 --> 4:51:17.600]  investing a half million dollars in six years on pretrial investigations and hearings so it's not
[4:51:17.600 --> 4:51:23.760]  a victory that you get chalked up in the record book well being beat them and we did we beat them
[4:51:23.760 --> 4:51:30.720]  with religious freedom and it's important for this reason it's not just an anomaly there are
[4:51:30.720 --> 4:51:36.320]  people that are concerned about obama care for example obama care can be stopped with the same
[4:51:36.320 --> 4:51:44.160]  idea obama care i guarantee you all of modern medicine in this country involves either drugs
[4:51:44.160 --> 4:51:51.600]  or medical devices and both of those definitions presume the people to be animals there is no
[4:51:51.600 --> 4:51:56.640]  medicine in this country at least not licensed medicine that doesn't presume you and me to be
[4:51:56.640 --> 4:52:00.800]  nothing but livestock from the government's perspective we're right up there with jason
[4:52:00.800 --> 4:52:06.960]  and jenny or whatever the two names of the donkeys were from uh your previous guests just livestock
[4:52:06.960 --> 4:52:12.160]  and based on that presumption they can mistreat us they can oppress us they can push us around
[4:52:12.160 --> 4:52:19.280]  they can do whatever they want because we are not deemed to be men and women made in god's image
[4:52:19.280 --> 4:52:27.280]  all of this is evidence of spiritual warfare this is not just politics it's not just law
[4:52:27.280 --> 4:52:31.360]  this is evidence of something that's been my opinion been going on for thousands of years
[4:52:32.160 --> 4:52:37.600]  and we are now just just we're catching glimpses of it we begin to see yeah same things going on
[4:52:37.600 --> 4:52:41.520]  now that was going on several thousand years ago it's been going on since old testament times
[4:52:42.560 --> 4:52:48.640]  and uh ultimately it involves your relationship with the god of the bible
[4:52:50.000 --> 4:52:54.560]  that's what this is ultimately all about if you are an animal you're not made in god's image
[4:52:54.560 --> 4:53:00.080]  if you are an animal you are not endowed by your creator with certain unalienable rights
[4:53:00.080 --> 4:53:06.720]  as declared in the declaration of independence they are trying to get us to turn our back
[4:53:07.440 --> 4:53:15.120]  on those god-given unalienable rights pretty much the same way esau was encouraged to turn
[4:53:15.120 --> 4:53:21.120]  his back on the birthright that he received when he was first born jacob talked him into
[4:53:21.120 --> 4:53:26.960]  trading his birthright for a bowl of potage and later in the bible god says twice he says two
[4:53:26.960 --> 4:53:33.200]  different times in the bible he says jacob i have loved but esau i have hated i've never seen an
[4:53:33.200 --> 4:53:40.720]  explanation why god hates esau but i think the reason he hates esau is because esau turned his
[4:53:40.720 --> 4:53:47.040]  back on his birthrights that was a function he was the first one out of the womb he got the
[4:53:47.040 --> 4:53:51.760]  birthright presumably so this extends this as an act and he waived his right alfred i don't mean to
[4:53:51.760 --> 4:53:56.320]  interrupt you but i want to talk about birth birthrights i just got a call from jesse ventura
[4:53:57.040 --> 4:54:04.080]  and uh and and and i talked to uh ty jesse was on yesh damn good friends with him uh jesse as you
[4:54:04.080 --> 4:54:08.720]  know former minnesota governor sued over the fact and i've flown with him i've witnessed it i was
[4:54:08.720 --> 4:54:13.920]  probably going to be a witness by the way to them grabbing his genitals and you know squeezing on him
[4:54:13.920 --> 4:54:19.360]  and ron paul has said this has been done to him as well uh he he has said that he deserves his day
[4:54:19.360 --> 4:54:26.400]  in court the federal judge after waiting four months to rule uh ap pioneer press twin cities reports
[4:54:27.200 --> 4:54:33.040]  us district court ventura suit over certs tossed i got the call and they said we're gonna have a
[4:54:33.040 --> 4:54:37.520]  press conference at noon tomorrow central and then they're gonna be on the shows he promised to give
[4:54:37.520 --> 4:54:42.640]  us the first interview after the press conference if this happened uh but then they were like wait
[4:54:42.640 --> 4:54:46.880]  till tomorrow and then i i googled it while i was talking to him and i said no it's hit the news
[4:54:46.880 --> 4:54:54.800]  as of 844 central so we're talking 12 minutes ago uh but but here's this example now the tsa is
[4:54:54.800 --> 4:54:59.440]  saying they're going to be on the streets of america so while you were talking i normally would
[4:54:59.440 --> 4:55:04.960]  listen i saw ventura's call and took it uh we're on this fight together but i mean they are setting
[4:55:04.960 --> 4:55:10.400]  this precedent they're now announcing checkpoints on the streets lamp posts that listen to you uh
[4:55:10.400 --> 4:55:15.360]  hands down the pants everywhere uh telescreen saying don't trust your neighbors fema takeovers
[4:55:15.360 --> 4:55:20.320]  of media it says if hell is breaking loose but i agree with what you said a few months ago when
[4:55:20.320 --> 4:55:24.560]  you were on i want to hear you elaborate on this but talk about tsa i want you to talk about tsa
[4:55:24.560 --> 4:55:28.800]  i've got the biblical stuff we've covered that three or four times people got it it's powerful
[4:55:28.800 --> 4:55:34.080]  alford it's at the core of this you've covered the root but now the fruits of this we're looking at
[4:55:34.080 --> 4:55:40.560]  this right now uh i agree with you that they want soft power they want soft takeover it wasn't a law
[4:55:40.560 --> 4:55:44.880]  to take vaccines but now people won't take them they're trying to make it the law when they start
[4:55:44.880 --> 4:55:50.400]  forcing things is a sign of weakness not strength but but what do you make of this federal security
[4:55:50.400 --> 4:55:56.720]  force this tsa this domestic defense martial law system why is it all in high gear right now
[4:55:56.720 --> 4:56:02.400]  what is the elite doing from alfred adaske view right now that's got all this in high gear i think
[4:56:02.400 --> 4:56:08.080]  they're desperate i think they understand that time is running out there was a situation where
[4:56:08.080 --> 4:56:14.560]  zygmub irzinski if i recall correctly last year was yeah this goes back before that this was while
[4:56:14.560 --> 4:56:21.040]  bush was still in office and they and he became ensnared in the war in iraq and zygmub irzinski
[4:56:21.040 --> 4:56:25.920]  he was critical of bush and he said my god you've set the new world order back 20 years now you're
[4:56:25.920 --> 4:56:30.960]  right that was about six seven years ago and then he said again last year the new order is losing
[4:56:30.960 --> 4:56:35.360]  yeah yeah they're running out of time see they were and they were going to just kind of ease us
[4:56:35.360 --> 4:56:40.720]  into this over the course of the next 20 years or so and they understand they're running out of time
[4:56:40.720 --> 4:56:45.200]  and i think they're desperate to try to make something happen here in the next little while
[4:56:45.840 --> 4:56:51.360]  and uh we're headed for a big conflict in a relatively short period of time but it's encouraging
[4:56:51.360 --> 4:56:56.800]  to know that they are desperate if they're running this thing right they share the sheep and the sheep
[4:56:56.800 --> 4:57:02.400]  don't even know they've been sheared nobody complains right now they've got things like the occupy
[4:57:02.400 --> 4:57:08.880]  wall street uh movement taking place around the world they've had the tea party movement in the
[4:57:08.880 --> 4:57:15.440]  two years ago um year and a half two years ago uh the evidence is where they've got the internet
[4:57:15.440 --> 4:57:20.080]  and they've got programs like yours they've got blogs they've got people i mean there's a study
[4:57:20.080 --> 4:57:24.560]  i saw just lately that's something like 90 percent of the people don't trust the government
[4:57:24.560 --> 4:57:31.280]  you can't run the scam if the people don't trust you it's the whole idea behind running a confidence
[4:57:31.280 --> 4:57:36.480]  game people have to have confidence in the con artist they have to have confidence in the people
[4:57:36.480 --> 4:57:42.400]  that run the con game people don't trust the government they can't run this thing except by
[4:57:42.400 --> 4:57:47.680]  force and ultimately i don't believe they have enough force to pull it off they can run it by
[4:57:47.680 --> 4:57:53.200]  deception and ensnare everyone and that's what they've been doing but once you're aware of the hat
[4:57:53.200 --> 4:58:00.000]  trick once you know a magician is a is running a scam game over yeah i agree now there's nothing
[4:58:00.000 --> 4:58:05.440]  left other than to try to force people into compliance and apparently someone's made a decision
[4:58:05.440 --> 4:58:11.520]  to try to do that but i don't think they can pull it off i think they're gonna see so much resistance
[4:58:11.520 --> 4:58:17.280]  from outfits like anonymous for example hacking into computers and well just even turra i mean
[4:58:17.280 --> 4:58:23.120]  he's a regular guy and i've been around him personally he is genuinely pissed he called he said
[4:58:23.120 --> 4:58:27.920]  if ron paul's kept out of the debates we should have revolts in the street you know it's like we
[4:58:27.920 --> 4:58:34.560]  want peace but like 1776 these tyrants keep pushing they have no idea that good people
[4:58:34.560 --> 4:58:40.480]  are 10 times more powerful than evil i mean there's no bully can stand up to a pissed off good person
[4:58:40.480 --> 4:58:47.760]  they don't think that we can do it they are so the people that are in positions of power are there
[4:58:47.760 --> 4:58:54.400]  because they believe in power look at that sack of shit look at that sack of shit uh janet napolitano
[4:58:54.400 --> 4:58:57.760]  i'm sorry to talk like that but there's no other word the english language you describe her look
[4:58:57.760 --> 4:59:02.560]  at that sack of shit thinking she can run our lives and take our liberties and our freedoms
[4:59:02.560 --> 4:59:08.800]  and molest our children i mean she is a pathetic bucket of crap i i'm sorry i offered to talk like
[4:59:08.800 --> 4:59:14.160]  that i understand but those are the kinds of people that are attracted to power because they
[4:59:14.160 --> 4:59:20.880]  believe in it and i don't think in their mind i think they have a hard time conceiving that the
[4:59:20.880 --> 4:59:28.160]  power is insufficient to control but the fundamental issue ultimately is not power it's consent you've
[4:59:28.160 --> 4:59:33.600]  got to get the people to consent to whatever you're doing we saw this in the vietnam war when they
[4:59:33.600 --> 4:59:39.040]  tried to draft everyone and send them off to vietnam and it motivated it was the compulsory
[4:59:39.040 --> 4:59:44.800]  military service that motivated the riots and the demonstrations people said hell no we won't go
[4:59:45.600 --> 4:59:50.480]  all right right now we're seeing something like that in greece where we've got a different kind
[4:59:50.480 --> 4:59:54.400]  of compulsion they're trying to compel the greek people to pay this enormous debt and the greek
[4:59:54.400 --> 5:00:01.040]  people are simply saying hell no we won't pay we're seeing some of that even in the occupy
[5:00:01.040 --> 5:00:05.920]  wall street people are just saying look we are really withdrawn our consent that's right all the
[5:00:05.920 --> 5:00:13.200]  globalist fluoride all the brainwashing once that the near of control peels back it's the animalistic
[5:00:13.200 --> 5:00:20.320]  liberty lovers that the globalist vampires are so scared of yeah i agree and is people again people
[5:00:20.320 --> 5:00:25.520]  are losing their consent they're refusing to consent to government and it just puts so much
[5:00:25.520 --> 5:00:31.200]  sand in the gears government depends on their ability to con deceive and mislead the people
[5:00:32.080 --> 5:00:38.400]  and that's being just eradicated by internet by radio programs like yours and so on it's uh
[5:00:39.040 --> 5:00:42.880]  the people are just sitting back and say wait a second this is a bunch of crap and i'm not going
[5:00:42.880 --> 5:00:47.360]  along with it and now what the government you know there there's only about three tenths of a percent
[5:00:47.360 --> 5:00:51.840]  of the population that are police officers and there's only about three tenths of a percent of
[5:00:51.840 --> 5:00:57.280]  the population that are in the military and if they bring them all back they're still outnumbered
[5:00:57.920 --> 5:01:04.000]  close to 150 200 to one alfred let me stop you my wife was watching our video stream is so good
[5:01:04.000 --> 5:01:09.440]  it's in real time she called up my children are watching when i made that comment and it's it's
[5:01:09.440 --> 5:01:14.960]  desperate of me i'm not somebody in private who even uses profanity but i don't have words to describe
[5:01:14.960 --> 5:01:19.920]  janet apolitano so i apologize to my wife and children everybody else's children i will not
[5:01:19.920 --> 5:01:26.560]  do that again tonight it's just at a certain point i look at this this criminal this person that ship
[5:01:26.560 --> 5:01:31.840]  tens of thousands of guns into mexico drugs into the u.s it's come out in court and they don't get
[5:01:31.840 --> 5:01:37.920]  in trouble and it's more of a ghost dance it's a desperate you know uh there's no words to describe
[5:01:37.920 --> 5:01:45.280]  how demonic these people are and so i apologize for the using non-kings english there uh it's just
[5:01:45.280 --> 5:01:50.800]  at a certain point alfred don't you ever just want did you see all the videos of the of of of
[5:01:50.800 --> 5:01:55.200]  libya with the kids with their jaws blown off with their tongues hanging out and no i haven't
[5:01:55.200 --> 5:02:01.120]  seen them all that's for sure but i understand that was just another atrocity i mean but i mean
[5:02:01.120 --> 5:02:06.400]  that that is haunting me now i mean i must fight these people i cannot have this in my name alfred
[5:02:06.400 --> 5:02:11.120]  you know that point where you go even beyond fear and it just becomes like you're you're only afraid
[5:02:11.120 --> 5:02:17.840]  of yourself like controlling yourself i understand i'll tell you you reach a point where what i've
[5:02:17.840 --> 5:02:24.080]  come to understand is that your fear is inversely proportional to your faith you can look at revelation
[5:02:24.080 --> 5:02:33.360]  20 218 and it's got a laundry list of sins that will get you condemned to damnation and it includes
[5:02:33.360 --> 5:02:39.120]  the sorcerers and the murderers and the liars and the horror mongers and so on the top of the list
[5:02:39.120 --> 5:02:45.760]  it says in some versions cowardly in other versions those who fear and the reason is because your
[5:02:45.760 --> 5:02:52.720]  fear is inversely proportional to your faith when you really grab hold of faith and you really get
[5:02:52.720 --> 5:02:57.280]  the idea that god is real and it's not just a little game and it's not when you really get it
[5:02:57.280 --> 5:03:02.240]  what do you got to fear now my fear is i still have certain amount of fear my faith is not perfect
[5:03:02.240 --> 5:03:07.760]  but nevertheless you grab onto that faith and when you really begin to understand it
[5:03:07.760 --> 5:03:13.360]  understand it you become pretty close to fearless and if you can get perfect faith and i assume you
[5:03:13.360 --> 5:03:18.560]  can get you know you can achieve absolute fearlessness but uh it's okay well here's my
[5:03:18.560 --> 5:03:24.720]  problem alford i am fearless except i realize my fearlessness actually makes me weak at a certain
[5:03:24.720 --> 5:03:30.240]  point because because i am fearless and and then i realize that's almost reckless do you see what
[5:03:30.240 --> 5:03:36.880]  i'm saying i do i understand it as a fine line well from my perspective i mean without knowing
[5:03:36.880 --> 5:03:42.080]  you well enough to say one way or another you have to make up your mind whether you are fearless
[5:03:42.080 --> 5:03:47.760]  from my perspective in service to what the good lord wants done or you're just fearless in this in
[5:03:47.760 --> 5:03:53.120]  a secular and earthly sense in which case you know that may be reckless you may you better
[5:03:53.120 --> 5:03:58.000]  have a lot of judgment to back that up because there's some battles that are you know you know
[5:03:58.000 --> 5:04:02.720]  you can you don't want to step into the ring with mike tyson unless fearless is not enough to step
[5:04:02.720 --> 5:04:07.600]  in with now i'm not going to step in the ring with him unless i've got a 357 magnum i understand
[5:04:07.600 --> 5:04:12.640]  no i mean at a certain point they're poisoning the food the water and and we've got to break out
[5:04:12.640 --> 5:04:18.960]  of the trance and say it's over scum i'm done i see you and i want to bring you down well you
[5:04:18.960 --> 5:04:24.000]  know you mentioned you talked to someone you talked to you meant you used the word satanic or i believe
[5:04:24.000 --> 5:04:29.440]  you should be referencing people that are in government it's not just hyperbole it really is
[5:04:29.440 --> 5:04:34.880]  spiritual warfare that's what we are dealing with and it took me a long time to understand that
[5:04:34.880 --> 5:04:39.200]  and i know you know 15 years ago people talked to me about it and i didn't get it i didn't
[5:04:39.200 --> 5:04:44.080]  understand it i get it now that's what this is this is spiritual warfare and it's an important
[5:04:44.080 --> 5:04:50.240]  concept because most of the people in this country at least pay lip service to the god of the bible
[5:04:51.040 --> 5:04:55.360]  and you can take their homes and their cars and their kids and their cash they won't do much about
[5:04:55.360 --> 5:05:02.960]  it but you mess with their faith if they understand that you are messing with their faith they will
[5:05:02.960 --> 5:05:10.800]  come after you it is whole there is no war like holy war and if people can be made to understand
[5:05:10.800 --> 5:05:14.720]  the spiritual foundation for the conflict that's going on between ourselves and the government
[5:05:14.720 --> 5:05:19.440]  right now and that it is diabolical it's not an accident we look at them in a secular sense
[5:05:19.440 --> 5:05:25.520]  wow it's not diabolical yeah it is that's where it is and once you of course it's diabolical it's
[5:05:25.520 --> 5:05:32.320]  diabolical diabolical diabolical these people are doing it to watch the world burn it's the
[5:05:32.320 --> 5:05:38.080]  journey is the trip and and and when you realize they're not giving us quarter they're not backing
[5:05:38.080 --> 5:05:44.480]  off they don't have some goal of even power it's all about destruction and pain and they will not
[5:05:44.480 --> 5:05:50.960]  give up they must be met they must be faced we must commit to resist them period and when you
[5:05:50.960 --> 5:05:56.560]  realize they're a bunch of chicken neck scum that's what's even more pathetic is that is it's like
[5:05:56.560 --> 5:06:02.240]  watching a little bitty dog dominate some giant powerful dog it's it's it's such an aberration
[5:06:02.240 --> 5:06:08.000]  of the order of the universe the universe and justice cries out for these enemies of humanity
[5:06:08.000 --> 5:06:14.240]  to be brought low i agree i agree but you want to bring them low you got to get people from my
[5:06:14.240 --> 5:06:20.240]  perspective help people understand this is spiritual warfare they'll stand up and fight
[5:06:20.240 --> 5:06:25.440]  for spiritual warfare again take the kids take the car take the cash take the house take all of it
[5:06:25.440 --> 5:06:30.720]  they'll complain but they aren't necessarily going to fight mess with their faith and you're going to
[5:06:30.720 --> 5:06:36.240]  have a war on your hands and it's the one thing the government fears in my opinion i mean they
[5:06:36.240 --> 5:06:41.120]  don't want to mess with the people's faith not overtly because they know it's an explosive
[5:06:42.400 --> 5:06:48.240]  you know it's it's more than faith as you said it's in our gut but but i mean you know my issue here
[5:06:50.320 --> 5:06:57.280]  is that these people they are trafficking in men's souls you know i think it's a lie to
[5:06:57.280 --> 5:07:02.160]  say the root of all evil is the love of money that's how they sell out unconscious people
[5:07:02.160 --> 5:07:07.200]  they create this money out of nothing it's all debt based you the more they create the more
[5:07:07.200 --> 5:07:13.600]  you're in debt when you get to a high level illuminati they are about the souls of men
[5:07:13.600 --> 5:07:20.000]  the revelation says they trafficked in the souls of men they want your mind they want your soul
[5:07:20.000 --> 5:07:27.280]  they want your intellect they want that's what they want that's what they want what they want is you
[5:07:27.280 --> 5:07:34.400]  to consent to your own destruction they want you to step up satan can come down here and put a gun
[5:07:34.400 --> 5:07:40.400]  to my head and pull a trigger right now and it does him no good all right it's not enough for him to
[5:07:40.400 --> 5:07:46.400]  kill me it doesn't matter if i'm if i'm right with the good lord i'm going to a good place what he
[5:07:46.400 --> 5:07:55.680]  has to do is entice me into voluntarily turning my back on god that's the objective if i will
[5:07:55.680 --> 5:08:01.840]  abandon my birthright if i will violent voluntarily say well i don't need that in the same way that
[5:08:01.840 --> 5:08:07.360]  isaw did say i don't need the birthright just give me that bowl of potage you know if if they can
[5:08:07.360 --> 5:08:12.880]  persuade an individual if they can persuade a nation to abandon those god-given unalienable
[5:08:12.880 --> 5:08:20.000]  rights then you may be by that voluntary act you may open the door where you can stroll right down
[5:08:20.000 --> 5:08:26.880]  into hades on the other hand if you're prepared to stand up and say hell no i ain't i won't go
[5:08:28.320 --> 5:08:34.880]  they have another problem they need your consent forces counterproductive form really they can't
[5:08:34.880 --> 5:08:37.680]  capture souls by force they have to get consent but
[5:08:37.680 --> 5:08:53.760]  you know i'm the same way i'm just like you i grew up going to baptist churches i had a relationship
[5:08:53.760 --> 5:08:59.920]  with god but i know god's real but i you know when i was younger i just it wasn't part of my life
[5:08:59.920 --> 5:09:05.360]  when i was a teenager and you know but the more i study the world and history these these globalists
[5:09:05.360 --> 5:09:11.040]  they know about the spiritual they're obsessed with it this is a spiritual battle this is other
[5:09:11.040 --> 5:09:18.720]  worldly this is not just this is not just man against man there is a evil force guiding and
[5:09:18.720 --> 5:09:24.720]  manipulating this i agree and you know i harp on that story about me getting tangled up with the
[5:09:24.720 --> 5:09:30.880]  attorney general down there in texas we stopped him you understand he'd invested six years and
[5:09:30.880 --> 5:09:37.760]  nearly half million dollars and we stopped him with a religious freedom defense it's evidence
[5:09:37.760 --> 5:09:44.480]  that the system respects this no the hopey it's not allowed to take mumbo jumble listen the hopey
[5:09:44.480 --> 5:09:49.920]  are allowed to take mesculine i mean when it gets down to religious that's one thing the Illuminati
[5:09:50.480 --> 5:09:55.520]  bow to because they've got to trick you to serve them and they can't run over that you're right
[5:09:55.520 --> 5:10:01.680]  it's this religious it's this religious statement is the most powerful because it's universal galactic
[5:10:01.680 --> 5:10:08.160]  law that's exactly right so the question is just got to get people to begin to understand it and it
[5:10:08.160 --> 5:10:13.840]  took me a long time it doesn't happen overnight but you start and you come to knowledge eventually
[5:10:13.840 --> 5:10:19.040]  or you come to understanding you know it's takes time but and it's one of those things where i don't
[5:10:19.040 --> 5:10:24.080]  think i think you're already drawn to it i think in some degree i think some people are already
[5:10:24.080 --> 5:10:29.200]  drawn to this whether they've ever heard of it before or not it resonates with them their soul
[5:10:29.200 --> 5:10:34.000]  has been looking for it and they'll catch on they just need somebody to show me oh that's what's
[5:10:34.000 --> 5:10:38.880]  happening and you know one of the most important things we used to have meetings in Dallas and
[5:10:39.440 --> 5:10:44.560]  people were afraid i used those meetings were successful in large measure because after i got
[5:10:44.560 --> 5:10:48.400]  the meeting started i'd go to the back of the room sit at the back of the audience and when the
[5:10:48.400 --> 5:10:53.200]  speaker whoever was the guest he'd start speaking i would make it my business i'm paying attention
[5:10:53.200 --> 5:10:59.680]  and whenever he had an important line he made a memorable line our memorable statement i'd start
[5:10:59.680 --> 5:11:04.800]  clapping my hands all right and the rest of people in the audience would sit there and they were afraid
[5:11:05.600 --> 5:11:11.600]  but if they heard if you persisted at clapping your hands then they'd start too they are scared
[5:11:11.600 --> 5:11:18.400]  to death to stand up alone all right and they are afraid to be the first one to clap their hands
[5:11:18.400 --> 5:11:24.720]  but if you clap if one person will clap and persist in clapping eventually other people stand
[5:11:24.720 --> 5:11:30.720]  up and say well if i can clap too and then they are empowered they get a sense of communion they
[5:11:30.720 --> 5:11:35.840]  get a sense of community they begin to realize my god i'm not alone i'm not crazy i'm not the only
[5:11:35.840 --> 5:11:41.200]  one who thinks this is important information all by itself it's powerful powerful stuff it's part
[5:11:41.200 --> 5:11:45.120]  of the reason the meetings grew to where we had the biggest legal reform group in the country there
[5:11:45.120 --> 5:11:50.640]  by 1996 it had to do with just something as simple as clapping your hands and you put out the any
[5:11:50.640 --> 5:11:56.080]  shyster right yeah for 12 years was it any shyster what didn't i write some articles for you i can't
[5:11:56.080 --> 5:12:01.040]  remember now no no i don't believe i've ever published anything from you in the in the other
[5:12:01.040 --> 5:12:05.840]  what was the other magazine well i changed the name and i regret doing it but i did change the
[5:12:05.840 --> 5:12:12.480]  name to suspicions for the last no no there was some other magazine i remember vick vreeland
[5:12:12.480 --> 5:12:18.240]  he was the guy who came up i came up with the idea info wars dot com okay but he came up with
[5:12:18.240 --> 5:12:23.040]  the idea because there's a war on for your mind he was a retired firefighter great guy air force
[5:12:23.040 --> 5:12:27.680]  guy here in austin i think he still lives around here i gotta meet up with him but uh i know he
[5:12:27.680 --> 5:12:33.360]  liked your stuff then this was like a 97 i knew you had the any shyster but there was a uh there
[5:12:33.360 --> 5:12:39.520]  was another patriot magazine at the time there was uh media bypass media bypass that's exactly
[5:12:39.520 --> 5:12:43.360]  right there was media bypass now i'm gonna write a few articles for media bypass yeah that's it
[5:12:43.360 --> 5:12:47.360]  and then that article got to the austin american statesman and they actually admitted there were
[5:12:47.360 --> 5:12:53.360]  special forces helicopters and all these drills i want to go to calls the number is 877789 alex
[5:12:53.360 --> 5:12:59.280]  8777892539 people always complain with the time i mentioned the number they haven't written it down
[5:12:59.280 --> 5:13:03.760]  because normally my own studio is a different number than the regular weekday radio show but
[5:13:03.760 --> 5:13:14.000]  it's 877789 alex 8777892539 but alfred all i know is i go off my gut in my spirit and when i talk to
[5:13:14.000 --> 5:13:20.480]  you a what you're saying is historically right for my own research b i feel good when i'm talking
[5:13:20.480 --> 5:13:27.520]  to you i feel you know the strength of research and i feel a bond that you're connected in to the
[5:13:27.520 --> 5:13:34.960]  most high and and and when i get into this whole thing of fearlessness my fear is that i'm so bold
[5:13:34.960 --> 5:13:39.840]  and so reckless against the enemy because we're we're attacking them hardcore i mean the stuff
[5:13:39.840 --> 5:13:44.480]  i the stuff going on behind the scenes is insane but then i realize well god's in charge it's just
[5:13:44.480 --> 5:13:49.600]  that then i think well if i was more you know wise as a serpent harmless as a dove or whatever we
[5:13:49.600 --> 5:13:55.920]  get more done it's just it's just hard to try to balance it but you know what i'm just going with it
[5:13:55.920 --> 5:14:01.760]  and that's the end of it it's all you can do yeah you got to trust in the lord and uh you know if
[5:14:01.760 --> 5:14:06.960]  you're doing lords will you know if it's time for me to go i don't have an objection somebody wants
[5:14:06.960 --> 5:14:10.640]  to come up put a gun to my head and the rest that sort of thing pull the trigger i've had i've had
[5:14:10.640 --> 5:14:16.320]  plenty of life i'd like to get some more and rest that but in and of itself i'm not afraid of dying
[5:14:16.320 --> 5:14:22.720]  i'm afraid of dying badly and stupidly i don't mean either exactly i'm scared of failing that's it
[5:14:22.720 --> 5:14:30.560]  i'm scared of making of dying badly and not continuing my work that's my only fear yeah yeah
[5:14:30.560 --> 5:14:36.800]  well me too it's like it's hard to understand i really feel like i've been called by the good
[5:14:36.800 --> 5:14:40.720]  lord to do this and it wasn't something i was looking for i didn't start out as a holy road
[5:14:40.720 --> 5:14:46.080]  i remember 15 years ago i wasn't even religious no no the same thing with me pretty much the same
[5:14:46.080 --> 5:14:51.440]  thing with me it was just a casual thing but you get dragged into this kicking and screaming
[5:14:51.440 --> 5:14:56.320]  whether you want like it or not i don't know once you get that you believe you're called you don't
[5:14:56.320 --> 5:15:01.920]  have any choice you do it i'm gonna do this until the day i die i that that's just virtual certainty
[5:15:01.920 --> 5:15:07.280]  there's no retirement i'm not planning on retiring i may have to live in you know in in poverty or
[5:15:07.280 --> 5:15:12.160]  whatever but that doesn't disturb me i'm gonna do this good lord he will present opportunities
[5:15:12.160 --> 5:15:18.400]  and if it's only to talk to one person sometimes that's all you get i'll talk to 500 maybe only
[5:15:18.400 --> 5:15:24.560]  reach one good enough good enough my job is to scatter the seeds and like johnny apple seed
[5:15:24.560 --> 5:15:30.080]  i'm not in charge of making sure the seeds grow i'm not charged of of harvest in the apples i may
[5:15:30.080 --> 5:15:35.440]  not even get to eat any of the apples but i am in charge of spreading some of those seeds around
[5:15:35.440 --> 5:15:41.600]  and i intend to do so to the limit of my ability you know good lord and i like it it's it's a great
[5:15:41.600 --> 5:15:48.240]  life you know you pay a price for this it wears you down and it wears you out and there's a
[5:15:48.240 --> 5:15:54.160]  price to be paid and yet can you imagine another life you'd rather have than the one you've got
[5:15:54.160 --> 5:16:00.800]  right now no there's nothing more fulfilling than serving life nothing nothing i'm doing exactly what
[5:16:00.800 --> 5:16:07.840]  the good lord wants me to do i am doing exactly what i was meant to do i'm pleased i live better
[5:16:07.840 --> 5:16:15.280]  than most people can imagine and i have next to nothing but i guarantee uh i know i'm living better
[5:16:15.280 --> 5:16:20.080]  than most people can understand and it's hard to communicate but i know you know i know it's
[5:16:20.080 --> 5:16:27.840]  it's no no sometimes i say god i can't understand this understanding i can't deal with this discernment
[5:16:27.840 --> 5:16:34.400]  i can't i'm just a blob i have this thing of like i'm in dirty rags why am i being given
[5:16:34.400 --> 5:16:39.360]  all this knowledge this understanding how do i know the next thing they're gonna say on the news
[5:16:39.360 --> 5:16:46.320]  how do i know what they're gonna do next how are you giving why me it's almost in the brain burning
[5:16:46.320 --> 5:16:50.560]  with awakening and understanding is that what you're talking about oh i'm i'm absolutely
[5:16:50.560 --> 5:16:55.920]  talking about that i mean there is no one more mystified if anybody sits out there and say hey
[5:16:55.920 --> 5:17:01.120]  this guy think he's been called by god and they can sit back and make fun of me believe me i make
[5:17:01.120 --> 5:17:06.160]  fun of myself on one level it is hard for me to believe as hard as it might be for other people
[5:17:06.160 --> 5:17:12.800]  to believe what why is god calling me there's a bunch of better people in me i mean i get that
[5:17:12.800 --> 5:17:18.480]  it's and it's not just false humility i mean i am but alfred god has called you because you're
[5:17:18.480 --> 5:17:24.960]  humble oh my god i am now and the rest that sort of thing i don't know why he's called me i mean
[5:17:24.960 --> 5:17:29.120]  it's one of those things but there's not a doubt in my mind he has all right good enough for me
[5:17:29.120 --> 5:17:33.520]  i don't need to know why i don't need to know why all i need to do is try to figure out what
[5:17:33.520 --> 5:17:39.280]  direction does he want me to go in right now and it's not always clear you know i i kind of think
[5:17:39.280 --> 5:17:43.920]  he wants me to help head off in this direction is that right you know and i'm kind of well that's
[5:17:43.920 --> 5:17:48.960]  what happens god gives you discernment and then you're standing there going you've just given me
[5:17:48.960 --> 5:17:55.520]  all this understanding i'm just this feeble human what what does what what i mean and then you look
[5:17:55.520 --> 5:18:02.560]  at the globalist serving evil they're like these demonic pygmies standing around a bucket of disease
[5:18:02.560 --> 5:18:08.000]  worshiping and you're like why are they doing that you know it's like as humble as we are what are
[5:18:08.000 --> 5:18:14.400]  these devil worshipers doing what have they given him to what is the point well for one thing evil
[5:18:14.400 --> 5:18:21.280]  is a lot easier than good and part of the reason for that is that lies are nice and compact and
[5:18:21.280 --> 5:18:25.920]  tight and you can put a lie into a nice tight little package when you start talking about the
[5:18:25.920 --> 5:18:31.920]  truth you start talking about the truth of an orange and as soon as you start talking about the
[5:18:31.920 --> 5:18:36.880]  truth of an orange you are soon talking about the color orange and now you're in spectrum of light
[5:18:36.880 --> 5:18:40.640]  and pretty soon you're into physics and you're into photons and the rest of the sort of thing
[5:18:40.640 --> 5:18:49.360]  the truth is almost endless yes but the lies are little tight compact packages and their truth is
[5:18:49.360 --> 5:18:56.880]  the universe truth is reality truth is powerful and the evil aren't ready to stand in that fulcrum
[5:18:56.880 --> 5:19:03.680]  that's exactly right evil is easy i mean good it's easy it's simple it's it's easy to understand
[5:19:03.680 --> 5:19:09.120]  it's the truth that's where you're wandering say what what am i supposed to do now because it's so
[5:19:09.120 --> 5:19:15.920]  big and the more you see the more there is to see at least that's an opinion i have no this is the
[5:19:15.920 --> 5:19:22.640]  most powerful radio i've ever done you're absolutely right my entire life is like whoa if the public
[5:19:22.640 --> 5:19:28.720]  could see this the discernment the levels the endlessness and you see the evil they run the
[5:19:28.720 --> 5:19:33.920]  temporal world but they literally are these stunted pathetic creatures and then you don't even hate
[5:19:33.920 --> 5:19:40.080]  them you realize they're slaves yeah i know and they're both pathetic in their own way they think
[5:19:40.080 --> 5:19:44.800]  they're they think they're getting over and all they're doing is condemning themselves to damn
[5:19:44.800 --> 5:19:54.480]  nation i mean it is stupid it's self-destructive i it's hard to understand uh what do you say you
[5:19:54.480 --> 5:20:01.040]  know it's it's dangerous it's challenging uh but you know alfred god doesn't want some candy
[5:20:01.040 --> 5:20:06.480]  butted you know good old boy who claims they're like a Pharisee up in the mountain god's looking
[5:20:06.480 --> 5:20:11.680]  for people like alfred adask and others that are out there watching tonight looking for real men
[5:20:11.680 --> 5:20:16.240]  real women god's actually looking for people that have been worldly god's looking for people that
[5:20:16.240 --> 5:20:21.920]  have actually seen the dark side and want the good and you've got to just open the door christ is
[5:20:21.920 --> 5:20:26.480]  knocking you got to open it alfred what's your point on opening the door people say well i don't
[5:20:26.480 --> 5:20:31.440]  have this intellect i could never grasp this folks it's not your intellect you open your level
[5:20:31.440 --> 5:20:37.600]  you open your mind to this spiritual information it's over that's exactly right it has and you
[5:20:37.600 --> 5:20:42.640]  know what it has to do with a lot of what it has to do with it has to do with trusting yourself
[5:20:43.280 --> 5:20:49.360]  and i don't mean that in an egotistical sense but so many people are fearful yes your gut your
[5:20:49.360 --> 5:20:54.800]  your common sense you look at something and something inside you says that's wrong and everybody else
[5:20:54.800 --> 5:20:58.560]  is doing it and it looks like they're having a party and it looks like it's a lot of fun you
[5:20:58.560 --> 5:21:05.120]  look at it and say no that's wrong you have to learn to go with that inside that says that's
[5:21:05.120 --> 5:21:10.240]  telling you what to do rather than just following the herd because most of them are just following
[5:21:10.240 --> 5:21:16.720]  because they're scared to death to trust their own judgment part of this in my opinion you
[5:21:16.720 --> 5:21:21.200]  got to learn to trust yourself you got to begin to realize good lord gave you eyes he gave you
[5:21:21.200 --> 5:21:26.880]  ears he gave you sufficient intelligence to deal with the problems he's going to handle you or hand
[5:21:26.880 --> 5:21:32.880]  to you if you're going to just follow the herd out of fear though and try to conform you know
[5:21:32.880 --> 5:21:37.680]  from my perspective again you got that story of esau coming back that way leads destruction
[5:21:37.680 --> 5:21:42.320]  you're back on that on on the birthright i think so too that's that's what i think well alfred
[5:21:42.320 --> 5:21:46.720]  we're definitely on the same wavelength i want to take some phone calls here in the last uh
[5:21:47.360 --> 5:21:52.880]  37 minutes before tex marz joins us but in the next four or five minutes anything else
[5:21:52.880 --> 5:21:58.800]  that's on your heart to add and give to this audience that's watching us across the world right now
[5:21:58.800 --> 5:22:04.240]  well i don't know that i've got anything in particular when you asked me to be on the program
[5:22:04.240 --> 5:22:08.800]  i asked what was the what were we going to talk about and uh i talked to jaren i think and he said
[5:22:08.800 --> 5:22:13.200]  i'll just talk generally about whatever's going on in the world and yeah we never we never we just
[5:22:13.200 --> 5:22:19.520]  say we're talking yeah it's not like that yeah all right well it's it's uh anything else is ringing
[5:22:19.520 --> 5:22:26.320]  my bell right now i don't know third party there's one i have in mind to create a third party all
[5:22:26.320 --> 5:22:31.440]  right and i've had this in mind for several years and i haven't had much success and most people think
[5:22:31.440 --> 5:22:36.080]  that a third party is an impossible thing this is foolishness but first look at the mathematics
[5:22:37.040 --> 5:22:42.480]  in a typical election half the people who are eligible to vote don't vote in an off your election
[5:22:42.480 --> 5:22:47.760]  60 percent of the people who are eligible to vote don't vote it means in an off your election for
[5:22:47.760 --> 5:22:53.440]  example you only need the active support in a two-party election you only need the active support
[5:22:53.440 --> 5:23:00.400]  of 21 percent of the people only 40 percent of our voting so you only need 21 percent to be elected
[5:23:00.400 --> 5:23:06.320]  less than one in four if you had a viable third party the odds that go down to something like 13
[5:23:06.320 --> 5:23:14.320]  14 percent a viable third party that could attract 13 14 percent of the support of the of the potential
[5:23:14.320 --> 5:23:19.280]  voters in this country could potentially take this country back in an off your election number goes
[5:23:19.280 --> 5:23:25.680]  up someone you get into a into a presidential election but it's still a small number one in five
[5:23:25.680 --> 5:23:31.120]  is more than enough to take this country back with a viable third party when you think about it
[5:23:31.120 --> 5:23:37.120]  it's powerful and it's important because we are not being overwhelmed we're not being defeated by
[5:23:37.120 --> 5:23:42.240]  the big battalions we can take this whole country back with one in five and i guarantee you probably
[5:23:42.240 --> 5:23:47.440]  60 percent of the country agrees with the kinds of ideas that you've put out on your program and i
[5:23:47.440 --> 5:23:52.400]  put out on my blog and little programs i do and so on i'll bet you 60 percent of them are sympathetic
[5:23:52.400 --> 5:23:57.280]  to what we're talking about we need only one in five the second point of this part of this third
[5:23:57.280 --> 5:24:02.480]  party the party platform would be the declaration of independence there would be no argument there'd
[5:24:02.480 --> 5:24:08.080]  be no additional planks in the platform declaration of independence one we get our rights from god
[5:24:08.080 --> 5:24:13.360]  to the principal business of government is to secure those god given unalienable rights
[5:24:13.360 --> 5:24:19.200]  use that declaration of independence then there's no in-fighting no party in fighting as to what
[5:24:19.200 --> 5:24:23.920]  should we should have on the planks of the party use the declaration of independence it's got
[5:24:23.920 --> 5:24:28.560]  everything we need is there well i want to bring up another point in we're going to phone calls
[5:24:28.560 --> 5:24:37.280]  sean trip jeff jt keith bet and a whole bunch of others that are holding alford look at ron paul
[5:24:37.280 --> 5:24:41.360]  he came out and said well if i don't win the republican nomination i may run third party
[5:24:41.360 --> 5:24:48.160]  he recognizes that it's about taking the field injecting real issues win lose or draw we win
[5:24:49.120 --> 5:24:55.120]  well and it's entirely possible right now it isn't even i mean given the internet it can
[5:24:55.120 --> 5:25:01.520]  happen like that if you if people believe in it if they believe we have power if you can motivate
[5:25:01.520 --> 5:25:08.960]  people all it's all up to them whatever they believe we can do listen alford i told torres
[5:25:08.960 --> 5:25:16.800]  nori this the other guest tonight i mean i i go to like arkansas california los vegas i mean i was
[5:25:16.800 --> 5:25:22.480]  i was there doing a jesseven torres tv show week and a half ago every five fifth people every five
[5:25:22.480 --> 5:25:28.240]  six people i walk by were listeners i mean that's power i know that alex jones has power
[5:25:28.240 --> 5:25:35.040]  that they recognize me and say their listeners shows our numbers are huge exactly right they're
[5:25:35.040 --> 5:25:39.920]  waiting they're waiting they're waiting i mean this is the sort of thing that i can't do on my own
[5:25:39.920 --> 5:25:45.040]  but i'm telling you i have thought about this on this third party it can happen almost overnight
[5:25:45.040 --> 5:25:50.320]  the only thing that's required is you got to get people to sign up to be candidates before the end
[5:25:50.320 --> 5:25:55.440]  of this year the big obstacle for third parties to get them on the ballot in texas you need 50
[5:25:55.440 --> 5:25:59.920]  thousand signatures at least the last time i checked the law they have to be rounded up april may
[5:25:59.920 --> 5:26:04.880]  of next year you have about six weeks almost impossible to do with small numbers but if you could get
[5:26:04.880 --> 5:26:09.120]  500 to a thousand people who committed and said yes i'll run for dog capture another guy says i'll
[5:26:09.120 --> 5:26:13.840]  run for state senator i'll run for i'll run for city council you get 500 to a thousand people if
[5:26:13.840 --> 5:26:18.080]  you had a thousand people who were running for willing to run for office they would be the people
[5:26:18.080 --> 5:26:23.520]  who well regardless as you think they need 50 signatures a piece when you run for office you
[5:26:23.520 --> 5:26:29.840]  educate people look it's resistance is victory saying no to this system is standing up against it
[5:26:29.840 --> 5:26:35.440]  is the answer i want to go to some of these phone calls you ready go ahead shon in missouri
[5:26:35.440 --> 5:26:41.600]  your first stop go ahead hi alex alfred i just first of all want to thank you both uh your true
[5:26:41.600 --> 5:26:46.800]  heroes to me and uh i appreciate what you're doing for our country and on a personal level i really
[5:26:46.800 --> 5:26:52.240]  appreciate what i feel like you're doing for my children and their future uh my question for you
[5:26:52.240 --> 5:26:57.920]  is i've listened to alex for many years now and maybe i've missed it but my question is what is
[5:26:57.920 --> 5:27:03.520]  the tipping point um i don't live in the city i live on the country uh what what is the tipping
[5:27:03.520 --> 5:27:09.520]  point where you draw the line is it when they come and ask for your guns is it when they come to
[5:27:10.480 --> 5:27:17.920]  and uh demand that you uh vaccine well i can answer that and then alfred can in texas in 1832
[5:27:17.920 --> 5:27:23.440]  or 33 it was when they came to take the guns in 1775 it was when they came to take uh you know
[5:27:23.440 --> 5:27:28.320]  to take the guns in other places it was when they came to take people's children for conscription
[5:27:28.320 --> 5:27:33.520]  at a certain point it's when they come to lay their hands on you and that's what tsa is is a
[5:27:33.520 --> 5:27:39.280]  ritual to put their hands all over you for forced inoculations to train you they're gonna set up
[5:27:39.280 --> 5:27:46.240]  checkpoints it's a federal martial law ritual to acclimate as many as they can alfred what is the
[5:27:46.240 --> 5:27:52.080]  tipping point tipping point is when the people it isn't so much what the government does it's
[5:27:52.080 --> 5:27:59.280]  when the people finally say enough it's it's the government the american revolution was over
[5:27:59.280 --> 5:28:03.920]  an attacks that was something like two or three percent they were paying almost no taxes compared
[5:28:03.920 --> 5:28:08.960]  to what we do today it wasn't a number so much what the government did it's when the people just
[5:28:08.960 --> 5:28:13.680]  finally stand up and say enough of this crap and we're not so far from that again tea party
[5:28:13.680 --> 5:28:19.120]  was a demonstration we're close to that tipping point the occupy wall street movement and the
[5:28:19.120 --> 5:28:24.160]  and the fact that is spread around the world indicates that we are close the arab spring
[5:28:24.160 --> 5:28:29.440]  indicates that there is a sentiment in the world where people have had about enough of government
[5:28:30.160 --> 5:28:34.640]  now we're gonna sit back and watch and there's going to be an event and it was kind of kind of
[5:28:34.640 --> 5:28:40.000]  like the guy in tunisia who set himself on fire he finally just had enough and he went out and he
[5:28:40.000 --> 5:28:44.080]  said i can't deal with all this government regulation anymore does himself in gasoline
[5:28:44.080 --> 5:28:51.680]  set himself on fire and he precipitated the arab spring right something like that is going to happen
[5:28:51.680 --> 5:28:57.040]  and the globalists tried to steer it and control it but they're still going to fail at the end of
[5:28:57.040 --> 5:29:03.440]  the day and and that's the issue is that now is the time to warn people now is the time to
[5:29:03.440 --> 5:29:08.400]  identify the real enemy now is the time to talk about the new world order because all these people
[5:29:08.400 --> 5:29:13.920]  are awakening but the globalists are going to try to misdirect them into false solutions
[5:29:13.920 --> 5:29:20.160]  call her anything else just want to make sure i kind of have to have it straight here um so
[5:29:20.160 --> 5:29:24.320]  you're saying uh for in your personal opinion when when they come and ask for the guns like they did
[5:29:24.320 --> 5:29:29.440]  during katrina uh that would be a time that would be worth saying no and they and of course they'll
[5:29:29.440 --> 5:29:34.480]  insist on taking them anyway and then that's when you're going to have you you feel that a
[5:29:34.480 --> 5:29:40.240]  ruby ridge type here's the deal we're as alfred said earlier we're hurting them politically
[5:29:40.240 --> 5:29:45.840]  and with our speech and like like gondy letting them abuse us is waking everybody up i'm not
[5:29:45.840 --> 5:29:52.240]  looking for a fight anybody who's been in a real fight isn't looking for one the point is i'm trying
[5:29:52.240 --> 5:29:59.360]  to control myself not to get in the fight because every minute we suck them in deeper is is is a
[5:29:59.360 --> 5:30:06.960]  closer to victory it's but but yes but yes that is your own personal moment where you can't take
[5:30:06.960 --> 5:30:13.360]  anymore and you're being assaulted generally it's about defense you don't use this knowledge
[5:30:13.360 --> 5:30:19.440]  in attack you're always stronger i mean take myself i i grew up in dallas i thought everybody
[5:30:19.440 --> 5:30:23.840]  got in fist fights every weekend i grew i moved down to austin nobody gets in fist fights i love it
[5:30:23.840 --> 5:30:29.200]  i'm not looking for a fight but i always learned every fight where somebody attacked me it didn't
[5:30:29.200 --> 5:30:34.160]  matter if they were big and bad and the state wrestling champion if they attacked me i could
[5:30:34.160 --> 5:30:41.200]  kick their butt the few fights i lost was when i got arrogant and got in a fight myself i have
[5:30:41.200 --> 5:30:47.440]  no power when i'm on the offensive when i'm on the defense look out i appreciate your call
[5:30:47.440 --> 5:30:52.400]  comments on that alfred uh the only thing i'd say is alexander solis and it's and wrote the
[5:30:53.040 --> 5:30:58.560]  gulag archipelago and he was talking about the prisoners in the soviet concentration camp
[5:30:58.560 --> 5:31:05.040]  oh how they burned in the camps they were constantly debating when should they have stood up and fought
[5:31:05.040 --> 5:31:10.400]  all right at what point because if anyone when they came in to arrest these people if anyone
[5:31:10.400 --> 5:31:15.360]  would if they knew there was someone standing behind the door with just a baseball bat i guarantee
[5:31:15.360 --> 5:31:20.400]  that the government wouldn't come in it was when should they have resisted it was a constant debate
[5:31:20.400 --> 5:31:26.240]  your callers uh shon i believe his name is he's he's he's facing that issue where is the tipping
[5:31:26.240 --> 5:31:31.600]  point nobody's got an answer for that it'll be something that no one sees understands but all
[5:31:31.600 --> 5:31:36.640]  of the sudden it'll be like tinder uh there'll be a spark the tinder will explode and everybody's
[5:31:36.640 --> 5:31:42.320]  going to say oh my god what's in fact guys pull up the alexander solis and he's in quote alexander
[5:31:42.320 --> 5:31:47.760]  solis and he's in how we burned in the camps pull a surprise winner lived decades in a camp look
[5:31:47.760 --> 5:31:55.680]  here's the deal the key to guerrilla warfare if it comes to that guerrilla warfare is do not wait
[5:31:55.680 --> 5:32:02.480]  in your place for them to come for you if it ever comes to that point you choose the battlefield
[5:32:02.480 --> 5:32:07.280]  you choose the time you don't even need a firearm a butter knife can get you any weapon you need
[5:32:07.280 --> 5:32:15.520]  we're not looking for that okay let me be clear but once that path is chosen once the war path is
[5:32:15.520 --> 5:32:22.640]  there then it's total victory it's defeat of the satanic globalist alfred i i mean part of the
[5:32:22.640 --> 5:32:26.880]  part what shaw needs to do right now you keep your eyes and ears opened i don't know what the
[5:32:26.880 --> 5:32:32.640]  tipping point's going to be but recognizing we're getting closer to that tipping point your obligation
[5:32:32.640 --> 5:32:38.400]  is to prepare yourself that's where you are right now be prepared be prepared learn study understand
[5:32:38.400 --> 5:32:42.800]  the moral foundation for what you're doing understand the technical foundation what do you need for
[5:32:43.440 --> 5:32:49.680]  firearms or what do you need in order to litigate be prepared exactly we've got a lot of avenues
[5:32:49.680 --> 5:32:55.360]  to fight right now before you even think about physical action to some some you know solution
[5:32:55.360 --> 5:33:04.080]  it's it's way down the road pirate fm local newsletters going to city council speaking out that those
[5:33:04.080 --> 5:33:09.520]  are the things we need to use now because believe me it's easy to talk about violence it's primitive
[5:33:09.520 --> 5:33:14.880]  it's simple it's quick that's not the road to victory we first have to get our word out and
[5:33:14.880 --> 5:33:22.720]  try to avert this peacefully i agree that's what i'm what i'm after i just want to think it through
[5:33:22.720 --> 5:33:27.840]  so that when the moment happens that i'm i'm steadfast i'm right not ready to compromise because
[5:33:27.840 --> 5:33:32.880]  what if they had a false flare tomorrow a false flag tear tomorrow and then boom all sudden the
[5:33:32.880 --> 5:33:37.520]  town's on lockdown they're coming around hey we need to get your guns because it's dangerous out here
[5:33:37.520 --> 5:33:42.800]  you know that's the kind of stuff i'm worried about i'm like okay is this the moment or do i go
[5:33:42.800 --> 5:33:48.000]  ahead and hand this over because maybe this may they'll they'll lift off the band tomorrow that's
[5:33:48.000 --> 5:33:53.440]  why they want to the registration you can hand them the junk today and then organize tomorrow
[5:33:54.000 --> 5:33:59.280]  always pick the time yourself never play on their time frame i appreciate your call shon
[5:33:59.280 --> 5:34:04.720]  okay this is the time for choosing i mean we are entering this phase these are people poisoning
[5:34:04.720 --> 5:34:12.640]  our water our food on record i've given you all the documents these are demonic pigs uh but uh
[5:34:12.640 --> 5:34:17.360]  at the same time it's time to reach out to those that serve the system aren't awake there's the quote
[5:34:18.080 --> 5:34:24.240]  and how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security
[5:34:24.240 --> 5:34:29.200]  operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return
[5:34:29.200 --> 5:34:35.840]  alive and had to say goodbye to his family or of during periods of mass arrest as the example
[5:34:35.840 --> 5:34:40.640]  of leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city people did not simply sat there in their
[5:34:40.640 --> 5:34:48.240]  layers pauling with terror at every bang on the downstairs door and every step on the staircase
[5:34:48.240 --> 5:34:52.880]  but it understood that they had nothing left to lose oh that's me folks you better believe it
[5:34:52.880 --> 5:34:59.520]  and had bodily set up in the downstairs hall as our founders gave us an ambush of half a dozen
[5:34:59.520 --> 5:35:05.200]  people with axes we got more than that thanks to dorge washington hammers pokers and whatever else
[5:35:05.200 --> 5:35:13.280]  we had at hand after all you knew ahead of time that those bluecaps were out at night for no good
[5:35:13.280 --> 5:35:20.960]  purpose and you could sure ahead of time that you'd be cracking the skull of a cut throat
[5:35:21.680 --> 5:35:29.200]  or what about the black maria sitting out there on the street with one lovely chauffeur
[5:35:29.200 --> 5:35:37.360]  thumb metal a commie leader what if it had been driven off of its tired spiked the organs would
[5:35:37.360 --> 5:35:42.720]  quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transported notwithstanding all of stalin's
[5:35:42.720 --> 5:35:48.160]  thirst for your blood the cursed machine would have ground to a halt allogander schultz and
[5:35:48.160 --> 5:35:53.920]  eason uh we'll go back to more calls with your comment on that uh the this system feeds off your
[5:35:53.920 --> 5:35:59.920]  fear and that's not just a i've had a judge tell a friend of mine that a judge told them look don't
[5:35:59.920 --> 5:36:04.320]  show any fear when you're in that courtroom they feed off your fear it's the same thing what solz
[5:36:04.320 --> 5:36:09.120]  and eason was talking about is everyone was afraid to be the first one to fight let somebody else
[5:36:09.120 --> 5:36:12.800]  fight for my freedom i don't want to fight for my freedom will somebody else please stand up and
[5:36:12.800 --> 5:36:17.120]  fight for my freedom i'm afraid to fight for my freedom i want someone else to fight for that is
[5:36:17.120 --> 5:36:24.160]  the attitude that puts people in camps or we have the alamo where 168 people stood against
[5:36:24.160 --> 5:36:30.080]  four thousand and died but their sacrifice is known in eternity exactly that's exactly what
[5:36:30.080 --> 5:36:34.640]  we're talking about it's a question whether you will succumb to fear or you will stand up as an
[5:36:34.640 --> 5:36:40.960]  act of faith an act of courage and hard to do easy to say hard to do but that's what it comes down to
[5:36:40.960 --> 5:36:48.080]  you but then even the japanese come and put plaques at the alamo well i don't i don't know
[5:36:48.080 --> 5:36:52.720]  anything about japanese no my point is even even the japanese people have come and put plaques at
[5:36:52.720 --> 5:36:59.520]  the alamo for their honorable sacrifice regardless of what side you're on the idea you live forever
[5:36:59.520 --> 5:37:05.440]  i mean it's better to die as a patriot on your feet than on your knees sucking the boots of some
[5:37:05.440 --> 5:37:11.760]  pot-bellied scumbag and again it goes back to his life so dear i can't remember the entire quote
[5:37:11.760 --> 5:37:17.520]  but i know he's so sweet than to live on your knees as slaves yeah exactly his life so dear no
[5:37:17.520 --> 5:37:23.840]  there's a point time it gets down to who are you who are you how far are you willing to go
[5:37:23.840 --> 5:37:29.440]  just to hang on to your life there's a point where you gotta say uh i'm not going any further
[5:37:29.440 --> 5:37:34.400]  my life is not worth there are things that are more important than my life and when you get into
[5:37:34.400 --> 5:37:39.680]  that then you become dangerous you're going to see something more important now you're now you're
[5:37:39.680 --> 5:37:46.480]  dangerous man all right so you escape that fear of dying and then well again i get back to the
[5:37:46.480 --> 5:37:51.280]  fear of not completing my mission do i let them take the guns that are my house so that i can
[5:37:51.280 --> 5:37:56.640]  organize against them yeah there it is his life so dear peace so sweet to be purchased at the price
[5:37:56.640 --> 5:38:02.400]  of chains or slavery forbid it almighty god i do not want course others may take but as for me give
[5:38:02.400 --> 5:38:07.440]  me liberty or give me death that's exactly right that's patrick henry right there that's right that's
[5:38:07.440 --> 5:38:12.320]  right but i mean people thought that's a radical statement give me liberty or give me death that's
[5:38:12.320 --> 5:38:18.320]  the only answer if you're not willing to die you don't get liberty exactly and there's always some
[5:38:18.320 --> 5:38:23.200]  little little creature that wants to steal your liberty there's always some bossy pot belly
[5:38:23.200 --> 5:38:28.320]  that's going to try to overrun you if you're not ready to fight them they get ready to bend over
[5:38:28.320 --> 5:38:33.280]  that's exactly right and where does liberty come from according to declaration of independence
[5:38:33.280 --> 5:38:38.640]  is one of the god given unalienable rights liberty flows from god freedom flows from man
[5:38:39.600 --> 5:38:45.280]  you free the slaves a man frees the slaves god gives liberty there's some overlap between the
[5:38:45.280 --> 5:38:49.760]  two terms but if you want the real deal you're that's the brass ring you're looking for the liberty
[5:38:49.760 --> 5:38:54.480]  that comes from god and you're saying look give me god if i can't get my god given rights
[5:38:54.480 --> 5:38:59.920]  give me out of here i don't want to be here and that's the deal from my perspective it's spiritual
[5:38:59.920 --> 5:39:05.680]  warfare it's not just liberty in a political sense or a legal sense it's spiritual warfare god gave me
[5:39:05.680 --> 5:39:10.880]  that liberty i want it well folks if you believe in what we're doing i want to see more of this put

[5:39:54.560 --> 5:40:01.840]  trip in new york than jeff jt keith ben ralph palmer rachel don donna go ahead trip you're on
[5:40:01.840 --> 5:40:10.480]  the air with alfreda desk hi alfred and alex um two quick questions for you this would probably
[5:40:10.480 --> 5:40:19.040]  meant more before the supposed osama bin laden capture but wouldn't have drove obama's ratings
[5:40:19.040 --> 5:40:25.200]  through the roof if he would have all of a sudden announced what we've all wanted
[5:40:25.200 --> 5:40:32.240]  and said that he thinks world trade center number seven collapse was suspicious and actually
[5:40:32.240 --> 5:40:40.320]  relaunched an investigation with real experts well i don't believe obama's ever gonna
[5:40:40.320 --> 5:40:44.160]  make that statement and i doubt if anybody in the white house who wants to keep breathing
[5:40:44.160 --> 5:40:48.880]  the much longer is going to make that statement either it's going to take an interesting revolution
[5:40:48.880 --> 5:40:53.280]  to get anyone in a significant position of power in government especially the white house
[5:40:53.280 --> 5:40:57.360]  who admit there's something suspicious i mean it's come out the government's dealing the drugs
[5:40:57.360 --> 5:41:01.520]  and bringing the guns or the different crime syndicates there are a group of criminals
[5:41:01.520 --> 5:41:09.360]  will never expect the criminals to admit they're a bunch of dirtbags yeah that just you know when
[5:41:09.360 --> 5:41:14.320]  that happens that means the christ is back amongst us it'll be one of the signs when you get a president
[5:41:14.320 --> 5:41:19.200]  who admits the crimes that have been committed by our government that means end times are definitely
[5:41:19.200 --> 5:41:25.840]  here the christ is he's either here he's awful close anything else trip yeah well i guess that
[5:41:25.840 --> 5:41:32.400]  takes that is uh we'll never hear that but my second question is is what is the vatican
[5:41:32.400 --> 5:41:41.840]  thinking wanting a world bank isn't it if i'm not mistaken isn't it signs of the end of times
[5:41:41.840 --> 5:41:48.080]  of one world government one all of the powerful structures are in the throes of the wicked one
[5:41:48.880 --> 5:41:56.960]  i mean alfred i agree but i would say this insofar as anyone including the vatican
[5:41:56.960 --> 5:42:01.440]  is attempting to graze attempting to create a new world bank we've got a lot of trouble
[5:42:01.440 --> 5:42:06.720]  happening in this world right now and again you look at you look at greece they are refusing
[5:42:06.720 --> 5:42:12.080]  to pay the debt iceland already refused to pay the debt it's not their debt it turned out it was
[5:42:12.080 --> 5:42:16.800]  all owed by the banks i understand it's all a bunch of it's it's paying someone else's debt
[5:42:16.800 --> 5:42:21.840]  there's all sorts of moral questions about it if the people of the world the people part of the
[5:42:21.840 --> 5:42:26.720]  part of the occupy wall street thing is motivated at least part of it by people who can't pay their
[5:42:26.720 --> 5:42:32.080]  college debts there's millions of people who can't pay their mortgages right now four million
[5:42:32.080 --> 5:42:37.120]  mortgages are 90 days or more behind on their payments we are in a world right now where the
[5:42:37.120 --> 5:42:43.600]  debt can't be paid and it's becoming increasingly obvious people are getting ready to just quit it
[5:42:43.600 --> 5:42:48.080]  when they quit the debt when they finally say screw it i'm not paying that's all i'm not paying
[5:42:48.080 --> 5:42:55.360]  how about that the debt based monetary system will go with those debts you're not going to just
[5:42:55.360 --> 5:42:59.600]  repudiate the national debt and it's going to come to that in my opinion it has to because it's too
[5:42:59.600 --> 5:43:03.280]  great to be paid it's got to be repudiated it's just a question whether you do it now or you
[5:43:03.280 --> 5:43:08.240]  do it five years from now or whenever but it's got to be repudiated in my opinion if it does
[5:43:08.240 --> 5:43:13.360]  you can't repudiate all that debt without also repudiating the debt based debt based monetary
[5:43:13.360 --> 5:43:18.400]  system and from my perspective without knowing the details of what's going on with the Vatican and
[5:43:18.400 --> 5:43:24.000]  perhaps trying to set up another bank or whatever i have somebody's got to be looking at a new
[5:43:24.000 --> 5:43:28.960]  monetary system that's based on gold or silver we're not going to the debt can't be paid i
[5:43:28.960 --> 5:43:33.200]  believe the debt based monetary system is going down with it and that means somebody's got to
[5:43:33.200 --> 5:43:37.840]  be putting a new banking system together right now in anticipation for this failure at least
[5:43:37.840 --> 5:43:42.320]  that's the way it appears to me absolutely you're absolutely right thank you trip jeff and houston
[5:43:42.320 --> 5:43:50.480]  you're on the air go ahead interesting hearing what's happening in your house we can hear a
[5:43:50.480 --> 5:43:56.400]  woman talking to people in the background god i love this i love the sounds of domestic noises
[5:43:59.360 --> 5:44:03.600]  jt in texas you're on the air we'll go back to jeff in a minute go ahead jt
[5:44:04.320 --> 5:44:08.480]  yeah i wanted to get alfred's take on what the new world order is doing to our kids
[5:44:09.120 --> 5:44:15.520]  they seem to pay attention to them what are these people's end game end game is to make the
[5:44:15.520 --> 5:44:20.080]  people make the children accept the fact i mean from my perspective i harp on this business about
[5:44:20.080 --> 5:44:26.720]  animals i've seen it i understand it pretty well and it's part of it they are working on the kids
[5:44:26.720 --> 5:44:30.640]  because they want to condition them you know a lot of people and we've all been conditioned to some
[5:44:30.640 --> 5:44:37.360]  degree theory of evolution is one classic example that theory of evolution is pretty much mandated
[5:44:37.360 --> 5:44:41.920]  by the government and most people think well that's just scientific and it's you know it's it's okay
[5:44:41.920 --> 5:44:48.320]  to teach science in the class and the rest of it but the fundamental premise of that of evolution
[5:44:48.320 --> 5:44:56.240]  is that we are evolved from animals and therefore we are animals it to my mind it's not just a
[5:44:56.240 --> 5:45:02.080]  coincidence that they want to teach and force people to understand and embrace the theory of
[5:45:02.080 --> 5:45:07.360]  evolution if you're just an animal it's not going to be remarkable to you to find a law that says
[5:45:07.360 --> 5:45:12.480]  you're just an animal it's not a surprise it's scientifically correct but people don't understand
[5:45:12.480 --> 5:45:17.200]  that under our declaration of independence those we we are endowed by our creator with
[5:45:17.200 --> 5:45:23.040]  certain unalienable rights and they only flow to men and women they don't float animals if you
[5:45:23.040 --> 5:45:28.080]  don't get those god-given unalienable rights you're nobody plus third sentence in the declaration
[5:45:28.080 --> 5:45:34.880]  says that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men they are telling us the
[5:45:34.880 --> 5:45:41.200]  purpose of government is envisioned by the founders was to secure to every man woman and even unborn
[5:45:41.200 --> 5:45:46.800]  child their god-given unalienable rights insofar as government can persuade you that you're nothing
[5:45:46.800 --> 5:45:52.160]  but an animal they have no obligation to to recognize or secure your god-given unalienable
[5:45:52.160 --> 5:45:57.680]  rights from my perspective this is central to the problem jt does that answer your question
[5:45:57.680 --> 5:46:07.120]  yes alex anything else no thank you thank you jt keith in california you're on the air with alfred
[5:46:07.120 --> 5:46:14.560]  desk yeah i just had a statement i wanted to make alex this is uh more to your audience than to you
[5:46:15.680 --> 5:46:21.360]  i i'm not addressing us to the people that are donating to people that have the bumper stickers
[5:46:21.360 --> 5:46:28.560]  and things like that what i find interesting is you have millions of viewers out there i think you
[5:46:28.560 --> 5:46:35.120]  had about 170 right now in donations it's almost like people said on the sidelines that you know
[5:46:35.120 --> 5:46:40.800]  people really donate a dollar donating something to this put this thing to the roof and they don't
[5:46:40.800 --> 5:46:44.080]  even have the care out there it's like they're watching this is like it's entertainment or
[5:46:44.080 --> 5:46:48.640]  something they don't get involved i live here in the bay area i might have seen two of your
[5:46:48.640 --> 5:46:53.360]  ample work stickers within a past year on cars i went up to the end of fed the demonstration
[5:46:53.360 --> 5:46:57.600]  there was two of us from ample work there i mean what's wrong with people are they so
[5:46:57.600 --> 5:47:02.080]  cowardly they can't step up their own kids are at stake or the lines are staking
[5:47:03.120 --> 5:47:09.200]  they'll stand for anything well keith i'll tell you this i found that once people make that first
[5:47:09.200 --> 5:47:15.040]  step to be public that's a big step they they think they're in danger the truth is you're in
[5:47:15.040 --> 5:47:21.920]  danger when you're not public from my experience that's this whole chilling effect and yes uh
[5:47:21.920 --> 5:47:27.600]  we're into depression and that's why i'm not even telling folks hey give us donations we gotta have
[5:47:27.600 --> 5:47:33.040]  them it'll help me hire the next line of people so that we can do it even better nightly news and
[5:47:33.040 --> 5:47:37.360]  radio show and produce even more and we'll have a great effect and reach tens of millions of people
[5:47:37.360 --> 5:47:42.400]  biggest bang for the buck out there but you know i never even wanted to grow to this level
[5:47:42.400 --> 5:47:49.120]  now that i'm here i i do need the funding it's info wars moneybomb.com or 888 2533139
[5:47:50.160 --> 5:47:55.760]  but uh yeah we have millions of listeners every day 15 million a week conservatively
[5:47:55.760 --> 5:48:02.000]  and you're right it is a tiny fraction that will even spread the word tell folks about the radio
[5:48:02.000 --> 5:48:12.320]  show buy a video donate we have donations one time a year but it is because somehow people
[5:48:12.320 --> 5:48:17.440]  like the government taking their money and giving it to causes they don't like but to actually give
[5:48:18.000 --> 5:48:23.360]  they understand psychically spiritually is to commit to something alford do you have any
[5:48:23.360 --> 5:48:28.800]  comments about this 27 hour broadcast and i think it's great what we've raised so far it's 170 or
[5:48:28.800 --> 5:48:32.160]  whatever i mean that's going to help us hire two or three people and do some stuff i think it's
[5:48:32.160 --> 5:48:37.440]  great i want to thank those that have donated but but yeah i mean ron paul should be given a billion
[5:48:37.440 --> 5:48:42.800]  bucks you know wall street's given that to romney and obama said of ron paul getting 20 million
[5:48:42.800 --> 5:48:48.400]  this show should get 20 million not half a million i mean it's like either give your treasure to the
[5:48:48.400 --> 5:48:55.040]  fight or have it taken and used against you you know it's like we ask give to us if you want the
[5:48:55.040 --> 5:49:02.160]  system just takes it i agree and it's partly partly a certain amount of fear people are a little bit
[5:49:02.160 --> 5:49:07.440]  afraid uh we're in difficult economic times anything oh my gosh i know i don't know if i have
[5:49:07.440 --> 5:49:11.440]  enough money for the kids lunch next week or something like that that motivates some people
[5:49:11.440 --> 5:49:16.160]  i don't want those folks to give i'd rather say that i'm just saying there's a certain amount of
[5:49:16.160 --> 5:49:21.520]  fear behind this and i don't know it's one of those things where again you got a trust in the good
[5:49:21.520 --> 5:49:27.280]  lord uh he'll give you as much money as you need now but going back to that keith keeps talking about
[5:49:27.280 --> 5:49:34.640]  people that know what's going on but won't speak out won't make a copy of a dvd won't give five
[5:49:34.640 --> 5:49:40.400]  dollars i've run into it myself we used to have meetings in dallas and we'd have a couple hundred
[5:49:40.400 --> 5:49:44.880]  people at the meeting and it cost 200 bucks to rent the room we'd have 300 people at the meeting i'd
[5:49:44.880 --> 5:49:49.680]  pass the hat to collect to pay the rent and sometimes i had to pass up two or three times
[5:49:49.680 --> 5:49:56.240]  to collect a lousy 200 dollars to pay the room rent you understand out of 300 people um they are
[5:49:56.240 --> 5:50:03.040]  notoriously cheap all right we had one guy come into town he was a good smooth talker he had
[5:50:03.040 --> 5:50:07.840]  people sign up he had a hundred people sign up that were paying what 500 bucks a piece to attend
[5:50:07.840 --> 5:50:12.400]  his seminars that extended over a couple of months once a week over a couple he collected
[5:50:12.400 --> 5:50:18.480]  50 000 out of a group of people that i could barely get a hundred and a half out you understand
[5:50:18.480 --> 5:50:23.440]  200 no it's weird you give him crap and make him pay up front they'll do it but you give him the
[5:50:23.440 --> 5:50:28.880]  world they give you nothing i understand that's weird it's crazy it doesn't matter the truth is
[5:50:28.880 --> 5:50:33.200]  getting out there and we're hugely successful we funded this whole operation thank you keith i
[5:50:33.200 --> 5:50:38.720]  appreciate your comments ben and iowa you're on the air with alfred adask alec i've been trying to
[5:50:38.720 --> 5:50:44.080]  get a hold of you for years now and i'm just gonna ask you a question but david ike was on earlier
[5:50:44.080 --> 5:50:48.640]  and that guy that you're right he is on fire right now i've been paying for that guy for a long time
[5:50:48.640 --> 5:50:53.520]  but um i think someone that goes to all of your guests you've had and jessie venture and david
[5:50:53.520 --> 5:50:59.760]  mustain yesterday um like gandhi said you know you're in a minority of one the truth is still
[5:50:59.760 --> 5:51:05.360]  the truth and no matter what race you know what sex what you're you know anything you do in your
[5:51:05.360 --> 5:51:12.880]  day the truth is you know in all of these people and when you say you know we're all in you know
[5:51:12.880 --> 5:51:17.680]  we're not just all in with ourselves we want all the truth we want all the corruption you want all
[5:51:17.680 --> 5:51:23.920]  the crime we want to see what we're living with in everyday life not just sitting on the sidelines
[5:51:23.920 --> 5:51:27.840]  and saying oh it's kind of bad let's not do anything no i want it all and bring it all
[5:51:27.840 --> 5:51:35.360]  to me because i want to know everything okay it's one of those things good lord calls you to get
[5:51:35.360 --> 5:51:39.280]  the truth and once you get an appetite for it i don't i can't imagine how you can give it up
[5:51:40.400 --> 5:51:44.320]  i mean but there's so i mean but you know there's so many people out there that you know if i say
[5:51:44.320 --> 5:51:48.640]  you know hey do you see the kid he's groping people or you know if you look at from the point of view
[5:51:48.640 --> 5:51:53.680]  we're just you know sit yourself down they make excuses oh they have a reason they think if they
[5:51:53.680 --> 5:51:59.280]  make an excuse for it it makes it okay yeah but but i'm going to get you know everyone in the world
[5:51:59.280 --> 5:52:04.720]  can ask themselves one simple question am i treated and looked upon as an animal by people
[5:52:04.720 --> 5:52:09.680]  that control all of the systems or might look upon as someone that's full of love and ambition
[5:52:09.680 --> 5:52:15.440]  and wants to do well no exactly they don't treat you like a sovereign creation the image of god they
[5:52:15.440 --> 5:52:22.880]  treat you like a a a dropping from a rat yeah and like what david and i was saying i mean the man's
[5:52:22.880 --> 5:52:27.520]  amazing but the chasm that we have to get over it's not like a little bridge we have to jump or
[5:52:27.520 --> 5:52:32.560]  you know it's a chasm where we can barely even see the other side we need to go out into it and in
[5:52:32.560 --> 5:52:36.640]  the middle of the chasm there will be complete darkness and utter aloneness for you know just
[5:52:36.640 --> 5:52:41.840]  us truth speakers we're going to come out on the other side at some point and everyone needs to
[5:52:41.840 --> 5:52:47.120]  realize that the truth will get you there you know you judging uh man i agree i agree with you we
[5:52:47.120 --> 5:52:52.080]  got to get past our fear commit the truth alfred's got to go in just a few minutes we've got text

[5:55:52.720 --> 5:55:56.560]  question of courage it's a question of faith it's one of those things it's like you know people are
[5:55:56.560 --> 5:56:00.240]  afraid to give they're afraid of a bunch of things they're afraid to stand up and it's part of what
[5:56:00.240 --> 5:56:06.560]  you said earlier you're probably safer standing up than you are trying to hide um you know folks
[5:56:06.560 --> 5:56:12.720]  like you stand up and a lot of people are amazed you've been able to keep standing up it's because
[5:56:12.720 --> 5:56:18.640]  you stand up that you become to some degree invulnerable even though you're a target they'd
[5:56:18.640 --> 5:56:21.760]  like to get you but they also know if they do they're going to get a bunch of people that are
[5:56:21.760 --> 5:56:26.000]  going to get angry it's the people at hide and hunker down that are more likely to be captured
[5:56:26.000 --> 5:56:33.200]  oppressed well no it's what it's what shaltzenica goes back to a quarter of the city gets arrested
[5:56:33.200 --> 5:56:37.040]  deported what if they would have just fought instead they just waited you're the government

[5:58:57.760 --> 5:59:03.440]  really bringing all federal state and local agencies together so not only do random searches but
[5:59:03.440 --> 5:59:09.120]  also create an army of agents on wheels friday listeners pointed out local news saying the
[5:59:09.120 --> 5:59:14.160]  army was going to be out regular army running checkpoints searching citizens with police
[5:59:14.800 --> 5:59:20.240]  the governor got called our listeners called the wife of police department had plans to
[5:59:20.240 --> 5:59:25.760]  conduct a seatbelt checkpoint on saturday april 4th at highway 64 within the city limits of
[5:59:25.760 --> 5:59:31.920]  wideville the checkpoint was planned to be in conjunction with homeland security and the 251st
[5:59:31.920 --> 5:59:37.200]  military police in bolivar representative from tennessee district 80 sir thank you for coming on
[5:59:37.200 --> 5:59:42.320]  with us sure you're welcome thank you for having me alex you bet now we played the clip earlier
[5:59:42.320 --> 5:59:47.760]  of you on a local news station talking about army checkpoints uh the governor found out thanks to
[5:59:47.760 --> 5:59:54.240]  you and others and cancelled it can you just in a nutshell tell us exactly uh specifically what was
[5:59:54.240 --> 6:00:01.440]  going on uh yes i can the first of all i you know i have got a check now i don't have concrete facts
[6:00:01.440 --> 6:00:06.960]  but i don't think the military has first of all in the jurisdiction to be checking seatbelts uh
[6:00:06.960 --> 6:00:13.520]  when you look at the fact of a military unit being out uh your your daughter my wife is someone
[6:00:13.520 --> 6:00:18.080]  driving through a roadblock with all of these local officials the army and everybody out there
[6:00:18.080 --> 6:00:24.240]  i think it's just going to scare people to death i think our local and state officials have the staff
[6:00:24.240 --> 6:00:30.880]  when needed to check seatbelts uh to do a seatbelt check without the army getting involved and uh i
[6:00:30.880 --> 6:00:36.240]  just don't think it's a good idea well obviously sir uh i don't know if you've heard but yes it
[6:00:36.240 --> 6:00:41.440]  still violates posse commentators they haven't completely removed that 1878 law we know in
[6:00:41.440 --> 6:00:46.400]  mexico and communist china they have trips on the streets this is a sign of a banana republic of a
[6:00:46.400 --> 6:00:53.040]  third world uh police state so that we don't want that but the larger issue here is that they've
[6:00:53.040 --> 6:00:59.840]  announced homeland security wants to put 20 000 regular army troops to to patrol america the naval
[6:00:59.840 --> 6:01:05.360]  war college the army war colleges said their new job will be engaging us a combat with the american
[6:01:05.360 --> 6:01:11.200]  people to stop an insurrection against the banks uh so a are you aware of that b can you tell us
[6:01:11.200 --> 6:01:17.360]  specifically what units how we uh why the army was going to be out running checkpoints well i got
[6:01:17.360 --> 6:01:23.360]  this news late on friday and when i got the news i immediately jumped on it to try to call some
[6:01:23.360 --> 6:01:29.120]  local authorities that i knew first to see what was going on and when i made the call i found out
[6:01:29.120 --> 6:01:34.640]  at that point time that the governor had already made the decision to cancel this and which i was
[6:01:34.640 --> 6:01:40.880]  very proud of that but i am not aware of homeland security doing this i i did hear that they would
[6:01:40.880 --> 6:01:46.800]  be involved in this roadblock issue on last friday tuesday tennessee was the first to do this
[6:01:46.800 --> 6:01:53.200]  simultaneously at five way stations and two bus stations statewide they're recruiting truck
[6:01:53.200 --> 6:01:59.840]  drivers like rudy gonzalez into the first observer highway security program to say something if they
[6:01:59.840 --> 6:02:05.280]  see something not only truck drivers but cars everybody should be in be aware of what's going
[6:02:05.280 --> 6:02:11.040]  out on the road it's all meant to urge every driver to call authorities if they see something suspicious
[6:02:18.640 --> 6:02:24.000]  hi i'm janet napolitano secretary of the department of homeland security
[6:02:24.880 --> 6:02:32.160]  homeland security begins with hometown security we've got to have a civilian national security
[6:02:32.160 --> 6:02:39.440]  force that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded uh the airport adventures

[6:07:51.360 --> 6:07:57.280]  defense department training manuals he was somebody who woke up to the new world order
[6:07:57.280 --> 6:08:02.080]  20 years ago and he was one of the seminal people whose books i read that were number one best
[6:08:02.080 --> 6:08:10.720]  sellers that helped expand my knowledge he was a guy in 1993 94 that wrote project lucen exposing

[6:08:50.640 --> 6:08:57.600]  with us during this 27 hour live transmission alex i'm just delighted to be with you especially
[6:08:57.600 --> 6:09:03.520]  uh on an occasion like this this money uh money bomb uh thing because i'll tell you the truth i'm
[6:09:03.520 --> 6:09:11.440]  really upset about this uh i mean my my whole system is just going non-stop but if people
[6:09:11.440 --> 6:09:19.040]  realized how precarious how dangerous the peril is right now today i think they would get three
[6:09:19.040 --> 6:09:24.480]  times as much uh is already already giving i know you're gonna have a successful money bomb
[6:09:24.480 --> 6:09:30.160]  but when we finish this next 40 or 50 minutes i hope people will really help you because
[6:09:30.160 --> 6:09:35.200]  you know we've been friends for a long long time and you started out on the shoestring and man what
[6:09:35.200 --> 6:09:42.800]  you've done miracles uh got you married my wife and i over 10 years ago well there was a miracle
[6:09:42.800 --> 6:09:51.280]  right there you know you really married up oh no i'm delighted she was a very precious lady
[6:09:51.280 --> 6:09:57.360]  still is uh and those those kids are precious so i'll tell you you've really done well there too
[6:09:57.360 --> 6:10:05.600]  but i want to make sure that the america that we know can be great and was great uh will be exactly
[6:10:05.600 --> 6:10:12.800]  that i you know i i feel for violence for your kids uh and for families out there because america
[6:10:12.800 --> 6:10:20.000]  is not the same and we need to restore it as much as we can and we have such a fictitious
[6:10:20.000 --> 6:10:26.000]  political system in fact what we really have alex and i i think you'll agree with them is what we
[6:10:26.000 --> 6:10:34.640]  have is a global culture of corruption by the elite it's unparalleled in greed and criminality
[6:10:34.640 --> 6:10:41.440]  you know it really represents the failure of globalization it's the failure of globalization
[6:10:41.440 --> 6:10:48.400]  and we should return back to patriotism to nationalism uh to america first but as this
[6:10:48.400 --> 6:10:55.280]  proceeds uh and i believe some bad bad things are going to happen over the next year particularly
[6:10:55.280 --> 6:11:00.480]  as it proceeds though they will come up with their solution and their solution will not be
[6:11:00.480 --> 6:11:07.520]  less globalization but they will say we need more we need you know just like even the vatican
[6:11:08.240 --> 6:11:14.000]  was snookered into issuing a statement this week that said we need a supranational organization
[6:11:14.000 --> 6:11:21.520]  uh a world government a global currency exactly a global currency a global bank system and you
[6:11:21.520 --> 6:11:28.160]  know we already have these criminal organizations the world bank the international monetary fund
[6:11:28.160 --> 6:11:33.680]  the international bank of settlements the european uh central bank and of course the counterfeiter
[6:11:34.960 --> 6:11:40.720]  the greatest counterfeiter in the history of mankind which is the fed reserve i mean their
[6:11:40.720 --> 6:11:46.800]  printing presses are unimpeded by us laws alex i have right here in my hand it weighs about 10
[6:11:46.800 --> 6:11:55.120]  pounds or so maybe not that much uh a copy of the first audit of the fed reserve system if i
[6:11:55.120 --> 6:11:59.440]  don't want to give people the number on it because they can ask their congressman for a copy now
[6:11:59.440 --> 6:12:06.160]  remember this is as you know a partial audit now thanks to congressman ron paul and i have to admit
[6:12:06.160 --> 6:12:12.800]  to even the socialist senator from new england bernie sanders uh there was a little middle
[6:12:12.800 --> 6:12:21.040]  legislation that required the fed to to to at least come clean supposedly uh on a on the small
[6:12:21.040 --> 6:12:27.200]  period uh when they were doling out you know this 16 or 17 trillion dollars now remember
[6:12:27.200 --> 6:12:35.360]  17 trillion dollars this report uh talks about and it lists supposedly all of the corporations
[6:12:35.360 --> 6:12:41.200]  and banks throughout the world and how many billions they were given during the last couple
[6:12:41.200 --> 6:12:50.720]  years by the fed the the the number of this and it by it stated july 2011 is gao of course that's
[6:12:50.720 --> 6:13:02.800]  a the you know government accountability office uh gao dash 11 dash 696 but when i'll tell you what
[6:13:02.800 --> 6:13:08.800]  you don't want to eat a full meal when you're reading this 207 page report you know you may
[6:13:08.800 --> 6:13:15.760]  bomb it up because i mean the money the money is incredible did you know that european the european
[6:13:15.760 --> 6:13:25.920]  central bank was given a total of eight trillion dollars in a total of 271 transactions yes the

[6:13:51.360 --> 6:13:58.400]  barclays of united kingdom 232 billion now royal bank of scottland i could keep going and i haven't
[6:13:58.400 --> 6:14:04.480]  even named the american banks but then we get to the corporations alex we get we we get to uh
[6:14:05.440 --> 6:14:11.840]  you know everybody complained about poor old general motors right they made the the ceo's
[6:14:11.840 --> 6:14:17.440]  of afforded in general motors and christier go beg and grovel for some money from the tarp
[6:14:17.440 --> 6:14:24.880]  oh it was an embarrassment to them meanwhile the fed under the table was giving more they gave 10
[6:14:24.880 --> 6:14:33.040]  times as much money to corporations overseas like Volkswagen like bmw can you believe that and they
[6:14:33.040 --> 6:14:39.440]  were keeping it all secret promise i mean even mcdonnell's one of the richest restaurant cafes
[6:14:39.440 --> 6:14:45.760]  food places in the world got billions caterpillar uh corporation it goes all i mean the list is
[6:14:45.760 --> 6:14:53.520]  incredibly goes pages and pages msnbc got our bay lot money to demonize families to push abortion
[6:14:53.520 --> 6:15:00.640]  to push gun control there you there you go and of course all of this is by plan now what gives the
[6:15:00.640 --> 6:15:06.720]  fed and by the way this is a one-time partial audit that will never be repeated so we we should
[6:15:06.720 --> 6:15:13.520]  give thanks to congressman ron paul for getting a list of this 17 billion but it's been said that
[6:15:13.520 --> 6:15:19.360]  the fed reserve probably has given out 50 trillion now here's the thing Alex if you came to me and
[6:15:19.360 --> 6:15:25.120]  you wanted a million dollar loan and i gave it to you in zero percent interest that's a pretty good
[6:15:25.120 --> 6:15:32.960]  deal a lot of these people got zero percent interest on their loans and no collateral now you can at
[6:15:32.960 --> 6:15:38.320]  least turn and this is what has happened this is how we're financing this gigantic debt you give a
[6:15:38.320 --> 6:15:44.560]  huge bank uh overseas or here in the united states city core jp morgan chase some trust whatever you
[6:15:44.560 --> 6:15:51.760]  give them 50 billion dollars at zero percent interest and they go and buy treasury notes the
[6:15:51.760 --> 6:15:59.440]  us dead and get three percent interest now they don't care about giving loans to people to buy
[6:15:59.440 --> 6:16:04.960]  homes or automobiles or uh entrepreneurial businesses hey they can get three percent for
[6:16:04.960 --> 6:16:10.960]  doing nothing so they take with the left hand billions and billions and they buy us debt treasury
[6:16:10.960 --> 6:16:17.520]  notes and such it is the biggest scam in the whole world it is i have never seen anything like it
[6:16:17.520 --> 6:16:25.440]  evidently this has been going on for a long long time maybe since 1913 uh but as as an attorney told
[6:16:25.440 --> 6:16:30.640]  me evidently there is nothing different you know this is why we see the manipulation on the stock
[6:16:30.640 --> 6:16:35.920]  market if it goes down 300 points today don't worry that they had reserve in their banking
[6:16:35.920 --> 6:16:43.360]  pals for temporary reasons can drive it up 300 points tomorrow so that's why it's so volatile
[6:16:43.360 --> 6:16:49.360]  it's whip sewing back and forth and people are losing their money left and right and i believe
[6:16:49.360 --> 6:16:53.680]  what they're doing is redistributing the wealth of america we're the rich we were the richest
[6:16:53.680 --> 6:16:59.680]  country in the world but they are redistributing this wealth uh and and that you know when we
[6:16:59.680 --> 6:17:06.560]  start with the money but then we go to the oil they're preventing us from producing our oil
[6:17:06.560 --> 6:17:12.960]  through the environmental program and all these restrictions uh of the us fish and wildlife service
[6:17:12.960 --> 6:17:21.680]  and all this meanwhile though iraqi oil is being pulled up out of the iraq is the world's second
[6:17:21.680 --> 6:17:27.200]  largest oil producer where do you think the oil of iraq is going remember cheney told us alex
[6:17:27.200 --> 6:17:34.240]  we won't have to pay one cent out of our pockets for the iraq board oh yes we'll get all that oil
[6:17:34.240 --> 6:17:40.240]  from iraq but here's the problem they built two new pipelines across you know to the Mediterranean
[6:17:40.240 --> 6:17:51.040]  from iraq and bp yes oh infamous british petroleum bp and the chinese national oil company cmo c
[6:17:51.040 --> 6:17:58.480]  are getting all the oil i listen all you have to do is google google it up and type in in google
[6:17:59.280 --> 6:18:06.800]  china national oil bp iraq oil you'll find that they're they've got a contract they're the ones
[6:18:06.800 --> 6:18:11.840]  that got the contract they're bringing the oil out of the ground and they're rolling it through
[6:18:11.840 --> 6:18:18.240]  these two pipelines that the united states built and is protecting with our military and guess what
[6:18:18.240 --> 6:18:23.600]  amount they're paying for that oil well you and i know that it's around today i think was 94
[6:18:23.600 --> 6:18:33.520]  dollars a barrel on the world market they're paying iraq two big bucks alex to bp and the chinese
[6:18:33.520 --> 6:18:39.600]  national oil company now where's the oil going is it coming to america are we getting a discount
[6:18:39.600 --> 6:18:44.880]  forget it i'll tell you where it's where it's going the oil is going over to the Mediterranean
[6:18:44.880 --> 6:18:53.200]  they're loading it on bp tankers it's going all the way over to china and china has built 25 new
[6:18:53.760 --> 6:19:02.320]  gasoline and oil refineries the united states hasn't built one since 1976 and in fact sonico one of
[6:19:02.320 --> 6:19:07.440]  the biggest gasoline refiners in america recently announced that they don't have any business they
[6:19:07.440 --> 6:19:12.000]  don't have any that nobody wants to get their gasoline refined with them and they're going to
[6:19:12.000 --> 6:19:18.800]  close up their last two gasoline refining plants in america that'll mean probably 10 000 people laid
[6:19:18.800 --> 6:19:27.920]  off why is that it's because china is built you know 25 new gasoline refineries in the last 10 years
[6:19:29.200 --> 6:19:34.400]  china doesn't even have any oil to refine i mean they have a little bit there in the china sea and
[6:19:34.400 --> 6:19:41.040]  such but they're basically without such natural resources but they're getting all this oil so
[6:19:41.040 --> 6:19:47.920]  what is happening is united states is laundering the oil with the aid of the Rothschild corporation
[6:19:47.920 --> 6:19:55.200]  bp it's going across in these new pipelines we built that is the reason for the iraq war and
[6:19:55.200 --> 6:20:01.120]  china is being built up can you imagine they're getting the oil for two dollars a barrel and
[6:20:01.120 --> 6:20:07.840]  they're selling it on the world market for 94 billion and meanwhile why are the global
[6:20:07.840 --> 6:20:12.560]  is building up china because the cfr as you know 20 years ago said the chinese century is coming
[6:20:12.560 --> 6:20:19.440]  21st century why why is that the model well here's the reason why alex now you think of this
[6:20:20.000 --> 6:20:29.120]  we we first have monopolistic cartel capitalism not free capitalism uh as we once had but it's
[6:20:29.120 --> 6:20:38.080]  but it's cartel capitalism now the synthesis of that occurs when communism is is integrated with
[6:20:38.080 --> 6:20:43.920]  this cartel capitalism so you have a combination red china is the model for the new world order
[6:20:44.960 --> 6:20:50.240]  the Rothschilds and all the other elite george soros even now so you go on youtube and look
[6:20:50.240 --> 6:20:55.600]  it up george soros you'll see him being interviewed now they say communist china is the model it is
[6:20:55.600 --> 6:21:01.360]  the model it soros said it will be the leader of the new world order and he threatened america
[6:21:01.360 --> 6:21:08.720]  george soros said america better not resist so you know you it's easy to get rich when you
[6:21:08.720 --> 6:21:13.760]  have the world's second largest oil producing company and you're paying two dollars a barrel
[6:21:13.760 --> 6:21:22.240]  and it was all arranged by the united states now why would our own country stab us in the back
[6:21:22.240 --> 6:21:28.800]  and get rid china all this plush stores of oil well the same thing has happened in afghanistan
[6:21:28.800 --> 6:21:35.040]  now i want to reveal something to your audience that i doubt very few people know in afghanistan
[6:21:35.840 --> 6:21:40.480]  you know they they even actually admitted a little bit that they had found incredible stores
[6:21:41.440 --> 6:21:51.200]  of of minerals copper tin aluminum well guess who got the contract to dig it all out go online
[6:21:51.200 --> 6:21:57.600]  you can actually see pictures i mean hundreds of miles of huge holes in the ground and that's
[6:21:57.600 --> 6:22:03.920]  why caterpillar and these other big land-moving you know equipment companies their their profits
[6:22:03.920 --> 6:22:10.080]  are so high they're selling all this equipment and the chinese mining corporations have moved
[6:22:10.080 --> 6:22:16.240]  into afghanistan why are we there to fight the taliban there's there's very few taliban we're
[6:22:16.240 --> 6:22:23.040]  there to protect the chinese in fact i found a story online it was dateline i think out of india
[6:22:23.040 --> 6:22:27.520]  where the red chinese government complained to the united states that our military wasn't doing
[6:22:27.520 --> 6:22:34.880]  a good enough job in protecting the tens of thousands of chinese copper and aluminum miners
[6:22:35.760 --> 6:22:39.920]  they're getting all the minerals and treasures out of afghanistan
[6:22:39.920 --> 6:22:47.680]  where i saw a report detect them detects i saw a report six months ago were 92 of world
[6:22:47.680 --> 6:22:54.160]  rare earth minerals are chicom controlled there you go and the same thing is going on in china
[6:22:54.160 --> 6:23:00.000]  rich uh excuse me africa you know red china is moving in there in there with all the coal and the
[6:23:00.880 --> 6:23:08.080]  gold and the diamonds the oil and so forth so we have the same situation going on at the arrangements
[6:23:08.080 --> 6:23:15.760]  and now you and i know what to make sure that the chinese are protected as they steal all this stuff
[6:23:15.760 --> 6:23:21.680]  the african command was set up by obama and our pentagon we're gonna be we're gonna be there to
[6:23:21.680 --> 6:23:28.880]  die and protect the chinese and this is why listen red china with this recession going on they're
[6:23:28.880 --> 6:23:34.800]  not selling their products and they're not selling the toys and the furniture and the clothing you
[6:23:34.800 --> 6:23:40.320]  know because our economies have been suffering the the consumers really haven't been able to spend
[6:23:40.320 --> 6:23:47.040]  especially in europe so how is china continuing to build gigantic empty cities what's what's
[6:23:47.040 --> 6:23:54.320]  going on you know i was driving down the road listening to larry kudlow who's on cnbc and a
[6:23:54.320 --> 6:24:00.400]  pretty honorable guy at least you know you think uh but he has a guest on from red china a red china
[6:24:00.400 --> 6:24:05.200]  analyst who lives over red china and they were talking about the growth the incredible growth
[6:24:05.200 --> 6:24:10.080]  of the red chinese economy and how in so many years it would be greater than americas and then the
[6:24:10.080 --> 6:24:18.400]  guy said you know larry that goldman sacks has gone in and built 200 that's a bank right a bank
[6:24:19.520 --> 6:24:29.120]  but goldman sacks he says has built 200 000 gigantic warehouses throughout red china he says
[6:24:29.120 --> 6:24:34.640]  these warehouses are bigger than any airplane hangar in the world probably and larry kudlow was
[6:24:34.640 --> 6:24:40.240]  shocked and he said 200 000 warehouses well what are they putting in those warehouses he said oh
[6:24:40.240 --> 6:24:54.320]  they're storing things rubber lumber uh you know uh tan uh copper uh or uh coal and then i then i
[6:24:54.320 --> 6:24:59.360]  realized why the coal companies in america are prospering and their profits are at all the time
[6:24:59.360 --> 6:25:07.280]  high and the railroad's profits are high we're we too are sending all of our coal and our ore
[6:25:07.280 --> 6:25:13.920]  and other things to red china on ships now 200 000 now i immediately started doing some research
[6:25:13.920 --> 6:25:18.720]  and you know when i get to it i'm a pretty good researcher not the best in the world maybe not
[6:25:18.720 --> 6:25:25.360]  as good as alex stones but you know i'm sort of at the elementary level i tried but i found out that
[6:25:25.360 --> 6:25:32.320]  indeed to to do this goldman sacks and remember a bank but one of the largest banks in the world
[6:25:33.040 --> 6:25:40.800]  and they have a huge headquarters in red china that goldman sacks had bought the previous year
[6:25:40.800 --> 6:25:48.640]  the largest war warehouse building construction company in the world and put it to work in
[6:25:48.640 --> 6:25:55.600]  red china isn't it now what are they what are they storing up all these things for why would they
[6:25:55.600 --> 6:26:01.840]  have 200 000 warehouses in red china full of all of these natural resources are they are they
[6:26:01.840 --> 6:26:07.520]  expecting a war war three do they want to be ready when it occurs how do they get the money to buy
[6:26:07.520 --> 6:26:16.160]  all this stuff some terrible things are happening uh and alex when you go to europe now we are told
[6:26:16.160 --> 6:26:22.960]  now you think of it now there's 800 trillion dollars of cd debt swaps most of them still out
[6:26:22.960 --> 6:26:27.760]  there uh and that's the reason the whole you know they were marketed around the world because of the
[6:26:27.760 --> 6:26:34.080]  subprime loans and all that these 800 trillion dollars uh and bob Chapman has done a great job
[6:26:34.080 --> 6:26:40.080]  exposing this on your show you and he uh these cd debt swaps and of course they were marketed
[6:26:40.080 --> 6:26:44.400]  everywhere they failed and now they have yet to be covered now we're being told that grief
[6:26:44.400 --> 6:26:50.560]  that the whole world is teetering on the edge of utter financial collapse because of a little
[6:26:50.560 --> 6:27:00.560]  country named grief of 14 million the size of say arizona and its major export is what olive oil
[6:27:01.840 --> 6:27:07.840]  but they're telling us that through contagion or a virus you might say it's an actual virus
[6:27:07.840 --> 6:27:14.480]  that banks everywhere around the world might be connected and if grease falls the sovereign
[6:27:14.480 --> 6:27:22.880]  nation of grease then the whole world system may fall and it brings me back to alan greenspan who
[6:27:23.680 --> 6:27:31.760]  and in my new book uh i i quote him and in 12 different speeches he is the term creative
[6:27:31.760 --> 6:27:39.680]  destruction what we need is creative destruction they coined a new term they're going to destroy
[6:27:39.680 --> 6:27:45.200]  everything but only ashes you know like the phoenix that comes out they're going to create this new
[6:27:45.200 --> 6:27:52.640]  world order listen you know this is hokey what if grease didn't exist tomorrow morning the whole
[6:27:52.640 --> 6:27:58.320]  world would go on i mean i'd be very sorry for the grease the greek people but i mean olive oil
[6:27:58.320 --> 6:28:06.000]  14 million people come on something is going on big here they need a pretext they need an excuse
[6:28:06.880 --> 6:28:12.560]  but but grease is not going to break the whole world if it didn't exist tomorrow morning it
[6:28:12.560 --> 6:28:20.400]  wouldn't affect the world except unless somehow it's the fuse of the dynamite now there we have
[6:28:20.400 --> 6:28:27.440]  a whole different system uh and maybe they're not as incompetent in fixing this greek situation as
[6:28:27.440 --> 6:28:36.240]  they appear to be maybe in fact this is the the first uh salvo uh a war war three uh in terms of
[6:28:36.240 --> 6:28:47.040]  financial war so i i'm just uh very concerned tax continue continue covering that well it
[6:28:47.040 --> 6:28:53.200]  you know we see these things we see this global network of criminal organizations we see this
[6:28:53.200 --> 6:28:58.960]  fed that probably has given out 50 trillion dollars and you know we're worried because our
[6:28:58.960 --> 6:29:04.640]  our federal debt's going to be three trillion dollars right oh we're going to be three trillion
[6:29:04.640 --> 6:29:09.520]  dollars in debt this year how are we going to cover that three trillion whatever whatever it is
[6:29:09.520 --> 6:29:14.160]  meanwhile the federal reserve goes out and just belongs people at zero or one quarter percent
[6:29:14.160 --> 6:29:21.040]  interest with no collateral around the world over 50 trillion dollars and i have the bank
[6:29:21.040 --> 6:29:28.800]  audit thanks to ron paul uh the shows were 17 uh a trillion of it went what an amazing amount who
[6:29:28.800 --> 6:29:34.160]  would have ever thought that the the printing presses can do such an impressive and by the way
[6:29:34.160 --> 6:29:39.200]  it wasn't just the fed you know one little old bookkeeper sitting there they went out and hired
[6:29:39.840 --> 6:29:46.240]  uh 50 or 60 other banks and accounting companies to do the disbursements i mean they were lending
[6:29:46.240 --> 6:29:53.440]  out money so fast uh when the the big recession hit in 2008 they couldn't handle all themselves
[6:29:53.440 --> 6:29:58.960]  they had to go out and hire other banks to lend all the feds money they were printing to other
[6:29:58.960 --> 6:30:06.960]  banks it was the biggest distribution in fact i think they have lent out more money uh in the last
[6:30:06.960 --> 6:30:14.720]  three years than has been created since well caveman days i mean can you imagine that's how
[6:30:14.720 --> 6:30:20.240]  much they've lent out now they will not tell us that the only congressman other than ron paul
[6:30:20.240 --> 6:30:25.600]  who's done a good job on this is that the congressman alan greyson and you say what you want to
[6:30:25.600 --> 6:30:32.160]  he's a liberal democrat but he sure embarrassed the chief counsel of the fed and uh ben bernanke
[6:30:32.160 --> 6:30:37.440]  uh a little bit but by the way they made sure he was put out of office the next election alan
[6:30:37.440 --> 6:30:43.920]  greyson uh florida no no we've interviewed him by the way all right good by the way i want to shift
[6:30:43.920 --> 6:30:48.320]  gears here for a minute i'm normally listening to you text while you're talking but jesse vintera
[6:30:48.320 --> 6:30:58.400]  just called me back again uh the tsa has ruled against uh his his lawsuit he can't even have a
[6:30:58.400 --> 6:31:04.480]  day in court for the tsa grabbing his genitals what do you make of all this martial law garbage and
[6:31:04.480 --> 6:31:10.880]  open internet censorship talk and fema takeovers of media i mean it's getting crazy well it is you
[6:31:10.880 --> 6:31:16.880]  know even during the bush days we knew uh of the the spending that they initially announced 400
[6:31:16.880 --> 6:31:22.720]  million dollars uh to build uh you know what we would call concentration camps and this relates
[6:31:22.720 --> 6:31:28.720]  you know as you've done so many times a great job the continued continuity of operations program
[6:31:29.280 --> 6:31:36.240]  there absolutely is that program uh and all of this of course has been planned and the amazing
[6:31:36.240 --> 6:31:42.800]  thing is how much money they've spent on it i mean obviously many hundreds of billions of dollars to
[6:31:42.800 --> 6:31:50.080]  develop these systems uh and and the uh justice department uh is is covering all of this up as
[6:31:50.080 --> 6:31:55.280]  well i'm sorry to hear that about jesse vintera but it shows you that even the courts are not
[6:31:55.280 --> 6:32:02.880]  going to stop the out of control police state uh and the only thing that will stop it uh is programs
[6:32:02.880 --> 6:32:09.440]  like alex jones growing gigantic without without that i want to repeat this without the big billionaires
[6:32:09.440 --> 6:32:16.320]  that are giving money to the herman canes uh the uh you know the the romney's and uh even the big
[6:32:16.320 --> 6:32:23.440]  perry and of course barack obama he's got a money machine going uh too all of these people are built
[6:32:23.440 --> 6:32:30.560]  up for their little jobs uh and and and they will continue this new world order in the crash of the
[6:32:30.560 --> 6:32:37.280]  world's system i think one of the scariest things though alex i've heard is not just tsa but these
[6:32:37.280 --> 6:32:47.280]  rural uh collect collectivities rural councils uh to control our food uh in the farming system
[6:32:47.280 --> 6:32:52.800]  that barack obama has been set up now this goes all the way back to you know linen uh and his new
[6:32:52.800 --> 6:32:58.560]  economic other setting up these rural councils governors councils i mean this is right out of
[6:32:58.560 --> 6:33:05.120]  the soviet union absolutely i wish people would go back and get old books about the soviet union
[6:33:05.120 --> 6:33:11.920]  truthful books that explain how the commonest linen Stalin kaganovic and trotsky and the others uh
[6:33:12.560 --> 6:33:18.160]  first we have to understand the bankers put those uh commonest monsters in the office
[6:33:18.880 --> 6:33:25.680]  but we need to understand that that new york german british bankers put these people linen in the
[6:33:25.680 --> 6:33:32.000]  others paid a millions of dollars uh and sent them as horrible escapade uh into uh soviet russia
[6:33:33.280 --> 6:33:39.280]  and and they grabbed the hair of that entire empire and turned it into a killing machine
[6:33:39.280 --> 6:33:45.600]  and i see the same pattern everything oh no they're they're gearing up text i gotta say this down
[6:33:45.600 --> 6:33:51.680]  because i'm i mean it this is now life and death and i want your analysis there is no doubt that a
[6:33:51.680 --> 6:33:57.360]  red terror domestic police force total gutting of america where the new world order wants to
[6:33:57.360 --> 6:34:02.800]  rewrite this country and really break the will of the nation is being set up but as great as the
[6:34:02.800 --> 6:34:10.080]  russian people are this is not a bunch of poor farmers in the ice tundra of sabiria who never
[6:34:10.080 --> 6:34:15.680]  had a history of freedom our founders left us with the hundreds of millions of guns it is not
[6:34:15.680 --> 6:34:23.120]  going to go that way but they're playing the same old playbook of communism and uh my god
[6:34:23.840 --> 6:34:29.520]  i mean i pray to the lord this gets reversed but this is a collision course towards violence
[6:34:29.520 --> 6:34:34.560]  because there's a lot of people and i'm talking about 50 to 100 million who we're going to end
[6:34:34.560 --> 6:34:40.560]  up fighting and i don't think these chicken neck globalist all these potbelly little perverts realize
[6:34:40.560 --> 6:34:45.680]  what's going to happen to them text it is the incredible restraint that has stopped violence
[6:34:45.680 --> 6:34:54.240]  not weakness there is a army of loving compassionate people who make the worst globalist killer
[6:34:54.240 --> 6:35:02.720]  look like a wimp literally waiting with giant armaments for an absolute assault on evil you
[6:35:02.720 --> 6:35:07.840]  know you know i i believe you're right and they don't compare with the occupy groups
[6:35:07.840 --> 6:35:12.480]  uh all these people that don't really know what they're doing that have been aroused and many of
[6:35:12.480 --> 6:35:16.640]  them don't even know why they're no the patriots know exactly who they're gonna hit yeah and even
[6:35:16.640 --> 6:35:21.840]  the tea party people bless their hearts they're good people very well in tension uh but as you
[6:35:21.840 --> 6:35:28.160]  know they they have been used as well uh and in fact they they're the cheerleaders for the seven
[6:35:28.160 --> 6:35:33.920]  wars we're fighting over the middle east so they're they're not gonna be much help to us either uh
[6:35:33.920 --> 6:35:40.880]  but but i agree with you the red terror will start but when it does there may be a decided
[6:35:40.880 --> 6:35:45.280]  difference in what happened to happen with the peasants uh uh in the soviet unit but i will
[6:35:45.280 --> 6:35:51.600]  say this you know you mentioned the tsa and all these other uh everything from mind reading
[6:35:51.600 --> 6:35:56.960]  machines to uh the predators you know rick perry wants to have these predators well you know what
[6:35:56.960 --> 6:36:00.080]  they're really going to be used for they're not going to be used to stop the mexicans from coming
[6:36:00.080 --> 6:36:05.600]  over but but i i do believe they will have the mexican drug quartels and line them up and turn
[6:36:05.600 --> 6:36:10.960]  them into killers against us i think that that's probably the the real reason for the fast and
[6:36:10.960 --> 6:36:18.640]  furious thing to break down the borders uh to to bring in gun control laws and say we have to do it
[6:36:18.640 --> 6:36:24.640]  because these as you know these drug quartels have got a hold of these guns uh the laws are too
[6:36:24.640 --> 6:36:29.440]  loose and uh so we're gonna have to tighten up things and we're going to end the second amendment
[6:36:29.440 --> 6:36:33.840]  that's what they'd like to do but there are already too many guns out there many people your show has
[6:36:33.840 --> 6:36:40.240]  been on how long alexon but i bet about 17 years 17 years there might be 10 million americans that
[6:36:40.240 --> 6:36:45.920]  have bought guns after listening to your show and i don't blame them one bit so good for you uh and
[6:36:45.920 --> 6:36:51.280]  by the way that is a right to keep and bear arms in fact our founding fathers said that's the the
[6:36:51.280 --> 6:37:00.000]  key that's the key to uh freedom is to be able to uh put down the government well when when it
[6:37:00.000 --> 6:37:05.040]  turns into a dictatorship uh and i know that sounds extreme and i'm not calling for it i think it
[6:37:05.040 --> 6:37:11.600]  should be the last thing we do but once the order is given for this red tariff remember the soviet
[6:37:11.600 --> 6:37:22.960]  union had around 200 million people in 1917 200 million 66 million perish 66 million hey that made
[6:37:22.960 --> 6:37:30.560]  hitler six million or whatever look like a picnic i mean 66 million uh out of 200 million now we have
[6:37:30.560 --> 6:37:38.000]  320 million people or so that would mean over a hundred million that would perish if this red
[6:37:38.000 --> 6:37:43.120]  tear really got going now i think the soviet people were shocked about it but they couldn't
[6:37:43.120 --> 6:37:47.760]  they couldn't believe it was happening uh but everything is happening just like it happened
[6:37:47.760 --> 6:37:52.080]  in the soviet union and at first of course they were going to give the people freedom and freedom
[6:37:52.080 --> 6:37:59.840]  from the czar and all uh but but it turned out just absolutely horrible uh and these were madmen
[6:37:59.840 --> 6:38:05.200]  these were psychopaths you know just recently alex one of the things i've really been you know i i
[6:38:05.200 --> 6:38:15.920]  uh my background you know i i talked to the psychology uh for a number of years as well as
[6:38:15.920 --> 6:38:20.960]  you know political science and american government for three different universities but more recently
[6:38:20.960 --> 6:38:27.600]  i've really been studying the field of psychopathy the psychopath and you know there's actually a
[6:38:27.600 --> 6:38:34.880]  test dr robert hare uh canadian uh psychiatrist developed a test some years ago called a hare
[6:38:35.680 --> 6:38:40.720]  inventory uh where you can take a test or you can give a first a test even without their knowledge
[6:38:41.440 --> 6:38:46.720]  and determine whether they're a psychopath believe me i've been doing a lot of that lately
[6:38:46.720 --> 6:38:53.760]  and we have an incredible number of psychopaths uh at the federal and global levels and and and
[6:38:53.760 --> 6:39:00.240]  this is these people have the the main characteristic of these psychopaths is they have no remorse
[6:39:01.120 --> 6:39:08.880]  they have no conscience and it's true they don't mind feeling up a 90-year-old grandmother
[6:39:08.880 --> 6:39:15.680]  and terrorizing little kids at the airport they don't mind killing 3 000 people at 9 11 we're
[6:39:15.680 --> 6:39:20.880]  we're gonna have to understand something when you're dealing with psychopaths and they're liars
[6:39:20.880 --> 6:39:26.480]  you know i can quote one psychopath he was interviewed he was in prison for murder
[6:39:26.480 --> 6:39:33.120]  he was asked by the interviewer uh isn't it true that you have committed violent offenses
[6:39:33.760 --> 6:39:39.120]  the guy said absolutely not well i did kill one man one time but that wasn't a violent offense
[6:39:40.080 --> 6:39:48.320]  so this is you know this is how they turn things around they they use words the or well in use of
[6:39:48.320 --> 6:39:54.240]  words uh and and that's what all of our leaders are doing now you know i mean after all you read
[6:39:54.240 --> 6:40:01.360]  you read george orwell in 1984 it's it there again and then you take the 1917
[6:40:02.240 --> 6:40:08.400]  takeover rush about a communist uh and we know that brock obama was planted where he's at now
[6:40:09.040 --> 6:40:14.320]  that uh his mentor was frank marshall davis who was a member of the communist party usa
[6:40:14.320 --> 6:40:21.200]  no doubt his grandparents were part of the a communist network uh there uh and by the way
[6:40:21.200 --> 6:40:25.760]  here again we get with the banking his mother had no education at all in finance which he ended
[6:40:25.760 --> 6:40:31.840]  up as vice president of the largest bank in hawai his grandmother i mean that tells you
[6:40:32.800 --> 6:40:39.680]  the connections there between banking and communism uh and it's amazing that capitalists
[6:40:39.680 --> 6:40:48.400]  would be communist but they are the warburgs uh in the others the rossow's financed the 66
[6:40:48.400 --> 6:40:55.200]  million that were slaughtered uh in communist russia so we do have that situation you know
[6:40:55.200 --> 6:41:01.680]  that the occupy folks aren't totally off base are the alex well what happened is the globalist
[6:41:01.680 --> 6:41:09.440]  called for the demonstration just in a generic way good people showed up and then the banksters came
[6:41:09.440 --> 6:41:14.480]  in and tried to have the democrats take it over that's now pretty much failed so now they're cracking
[6:41:14.480 --> 6:41:20.400]  heads and shooting people with rubber bullets but but but but tax looking at this we have a big
[6:41:20.400 --> 6:41:24.960]  awakening happening but on the other side the globalists are accelerating their operation
[6:41:24.960 --> 6:41:31.120]  what do you make of the fact that israel was openly saying they want to strike iran in a larger
[6:41:31.120 --> 6:41:38.080]  view what is the reason for that what is the i mean is it a political diversion for the wars
[6:41:38.080 --> 6:41:43.280]  why is this coming to a head right now well i believe one of the things we have to understand
[6:41:43.280 --> 6:41:48.560]  it's not anti-semitic to say this you have to look at this as a geo strategic situation
[6:41:49.520 --> 6:41:55.600]  and what we would call nato or europe uh britain and france and so forth and germany that are
[6:41:55.600 --> 6:42:01.040]  basically our little puppets uh they have combined with israel and the united states and it's sort of
[6:42:01.040 --> 6:42:10.160]  like a triad there okay of powers and of course we have made israel given it 400 nuclear weapons
[6:42:10.160 --> 6:42:17.680]  nuclear weapons and all this and all the missiles even nuclear-based submarines so so israel wants to
[6:42:17.680 --> 6:42:24.240]  control the middle east uh and as long as they give you know the ross child's british petroleum
[6:42:24.240 --> 6:42:31.520]  the chinese uh the oil that they won't everybody cooperates now i mentioned that the triumphant
[6:42:31.520 --> 6:42:38.240]  or you know triad but there's red china on the other side that's working on this uh and in fact
[6:42:38.240 --> 6:42:44.560]  malaysia tongue you know uh cooperating has been cooperating with israel for many many years and
[6:42:44.560 --> 6:42:51.920]  then now his successors also have so there are many uh dionists jews working inside of red china
[6:42:51.920 --> 6:43:03.040]  today uh with the other elite so there will be set up a greater israel uh super national power
[6:43:03.040 --> 6:43:08.240]  of that whole area of the world including north africa that's the reason for the arab spring
[6:43:09.040 --> 6:43:13.520]  not only the nato bombing but actually turned into the united states that was giving the bulk
[6:43:14.240 --> 6:43:19.760]  of the bombing to the the poor people of libya and we grabbed all the gold that got off the head
[6:43:19.760 --> 6:43:26.800]  and stole his oil and by the way the fed reserve had lent gaddafi's uh libya bank 70 billion dollars
[6:43:27.840 --> 6:43:34.880]  now what did he do with that 70 billion dollars it's believed that he bought a european bank uh
[6:43:34.880 --> 6:43:42.960]  excuse me sovereign european sovereign debt so the way they did it was the fed gives libya and
[6:43:42.960 --> 6:43:52.240]  gaddafi 70 billion dollars in a zero percent loan he props up the crooked banks of uh you know europe
[6:43:52.240 --> 6:44:01.120]  and so forth no he's on record making a deal with sarcozy and cameron and blare before that okay so
[6:44:01.120 --> 6:44:07.600]  this is why they they took him out plus 144 tons reported of gold i think that's that comes out to
[6:44:07.600 --> 6:44:14.800]  about 72 billion dollars but in any case the israeli missile is working with the cia and the french
[6:44:14.800 --> 6:44:21.440]  intelligence and the british uh military intelligence you and i know about the gigantic
[6:44:21.440 --> 6:44:29.120]  u.s embassy the largest in the world that's been built in baghdad so there this already it is going
[6:44:29.120 --> 6:44:38.320]  to have 17 000 17 000 employees now iraq is a nation of around 24 million people uh about one
[6:44:38.320 --> 6:44:44.800]  third the size of texas but we have the largest united states embassy in the world it cost over
[6:44:44.800 --> 6:44:50.720]  a billion dollars to build uh and you have pictures of it you can find them on google just you know
[6:44:50.720 --> 6:44:56.560]  google it up uh and ask for the u.s embassy construction and they use things like a hundred
[6:44:56.560 --> 6:45:02.800]  big cranes to build it why would we need that they're well we need it to super intend and there will
[6:45:02.800 --> 6:45:09.600]  be israeli agents working with us just like they were at abu grob uh in the torturing business
[6:45:09.600 --> 6:45:16.880]  and there will be the british agents and so forth so this is a like the control choke point this
[6:45:16.880 --> 6:45:26.320]  u.s embassy uh for the home of middle east uh and as well as uh africa although there will be an african
[6:45:26.320 --> 6:45:33.360]  command uh so this is really what is going on there they're building up their geostrategic new
[6:45:33.360 --> 6:45:39.920]  world order israel is a part of it uh and of course the palestinian people are just well
[6:45:39.920 --> 6:45:44.800]  that's the way it goes that's why they don't want them to be a nation because then they might have a
[6:45:44.800 --> 6:45:50.240]  beef in the united nation so they're going to keep suppressing them as they've been doing but what is
[6:45:50.240 --> 6:45:55.600]  israel thinking because i've seen netanyahu earlier the sugar rid of the massage chief and others
[6:45:55.600 --> 6:46:01.360]  or is that all part of theater like all of israel isn't involved in this i mean this is so crazy
[6:46:01.360 --> 6:46:08.560]  to be doing this okay let's let's go from the beginning in 1948 israel uh as a jewish nation was
[6:46:08.560 --> 6:46:15.360]  founded uh by bin durian and the other terrorist the ergun gang and so the urami manuel's father
[6:46:15.360 --> 6:46:23.360]  was a member of one of those gangs uh israel shemir uh manakam begon all of those prime people
[6:46:23.360 --> 6:46:30.080]  who later became prime ministers were murderous cutthroat terrorist now they they they had their
[6:46:30.080 --> 6:46:36.640]  operations operated you read this in the book the ethnic cleansing of palestine by a great jewish
[6:46:36.640 --> 6:46:46.640]  historian ilian peppy uh and he he notes that the very first building they set up uh their headquarters
[6:46:46.640 --> 6:46:55.040]  uh in the tele v which was by the way a city founded in 1999 by 1909 by roth child but it was
[6:46:55.040 --> 6:47:00.240]  called the red house why was it called the red house because all they were all red communists
[6:47:00.800 --> 6:47:06.720]  and these were the same people who had bludgeoned and murdered much of eastern europe by the way
[6:47:06.720 --> 6:47:13.120]  steve pachanik who's reportedly jewish himself he was on like a month ago about the iran attack
[6:47:13.120 --> 6:47:17.120]  and he was he was saying all this and he was saying he was saying people around israel are
[6:47:17.120 --> 6:47:22.320]  communists and they're gonna do all this and they worked with hitler and it was all wild i i don't
[6:47:22.320 --> 6:47:28.800]  know why he was coming on air just saying all that well you know christian ministry not too long ago
[6:47:28.800 --> 6:47:33.040]  i was talking with the head of it and they were telling me that they were giving uh about six
[6:47:33.040 --> 6:47:41.280]  hundred thousand dollars a year in donations uh to a israeli hospital you know just as a good
[6:47:41.280 --> 6:47:46.800]  will project and i and i told them i said well you know they have socialized medicare like
[6:47:46.800 --> 6:47:53.760]  obama care in israel he said they do i said yes and not only that they have three abortions for
[6:47:53.760 --> 6:47:59.440]  all israeli women uh other than japan israel has the highest abortion rate in the whole world
[6:47:59.440 --> 6:48:04.800]  he was shocked he had no idea of this but yes it is a socialist communist country well but again
[6:48:04.800 --> 6:48:10.240]  i saw ads on fox news for a group and i went and looked it up and they're doing abortions so
[6:48:10.240 --> 6:48:14.800]  it's christian to abort jewish children because i guess you're anti-semitic if you don't want to
[6:48:14.800 --> 6:48:20.800]  kill jewish children well you you can't you know christians or if you're a jew and you become a
[6:48:20.800 --> 6:48:27.600]  christian you cannot immigrate to israel menachem begging actually that's prime minister actually
[6:48:27.600 --> 6:48:34.880]  practice secretly buddhism buddhist jews can immigrate to israel but not christian jews they
[6:48:34.880 --> 6:48:40.000]  are prohibited by law from immigrating so there is a prejudice and a discrimination i'm not trying
[6:48:40.000 --> 6:48:44.880]  to be anti-semitic i wish people would check these things out then they will know and this is the
[6:48:44.880 --> 6:48:50.400]  reason i believe they're cooperating with us uh in the what i call the murder uh of the of the
[6:48:50.400 --> 6:48:55.680]  middle east is to their financial benefit and so forth that's why the pipelines that were built
[6:48:55.680 --> 6:49:02.160]  from iraq uh go through israel and southern lebanon over you know one of them is right at hypha
[6:49:02.960 --> 6:49:09.040]  the poor text i don't think it's anti-semitic it's it's anti globalist communist influence i mean
[6:49:09.040 --> 6:49:14.960]  if a russian's communist we don't bash russians or if a chinese person is it's it's it's clearly
[6:49:14.960 --> 6:49:22.160]  something going on and it's it's it's just extremely frustrating and frightening uh yeah
[6:49:22.160 --> 6:49:26.880]  you know you know bobby inman lives here in austin texas admiral bobby inman used to be deputy
[6:49:26.880 --> 6:49:36.000]  director of the the cia a he was the guy that helped uh to catch one of the most horrible spies
[6:49:36.000 --> 6:49:40.880]  fact he did more damage to the united states than any spy in history a man named jonathan
[6:49:40.880 --> 6:49:47.760]  pollard he was an american jew born in galveston texas jonathan pollard but he he began to spy for
[6:49:47.760 --> 6:49:55.040]  the israeli massad uh and he he got a job working at the defense department and eventually he stole
[6:49:55.040 --> 6:50:02.080]  over 10 000 pop secret and secret documents and they told everything about were all of our our
[6:50:02.080 --> 6:50:08.480]  missiles were our submarines were at any time under the sea it was a terrible thing now what
[6:50:08.480 --> 6:50:12.720]  did he do with these 10 000 documents first of all he turned them over to israeli massad
[6:50:13.280 --> 6:50:20.240]  that sold them to red china now this was during the cold war jonathan pollard sits in the u.s
[6:50:20.240 --> 6:50:26.640]  prison today this is this is worse than the rozenbergs who gave the the soviet union the
[6:50:26.640 --> 6:50:34.640]  thomic bomb back in the fifties jonathan pollard bobby inman uh you know that the israeli
[6:50:34.640 --> 6:50:39.280]  nation wanted jonathan pollard to be freed and they were demanding the united states
[6:50:39.840 --> 6:50:46.640]  uh president to give him a pardon uh and i glenn was looking to to do that to please
[6:50:46.640 --> 6:50:52.080]  natin yahoo uh and what was the guy's name barak i think who's the prime minister then
[6:50:52.080 --> 6:50:57.920]  and uh he had already you know freed mark rich on the last day an officer or whatever another
[6:50:57.920 --> 6:51:05.280]  israeli spy uh in crook uh and uh clinton was uh wanting to do it but bobby inman
[6:51:06.160 --> 6:51:10.800]  met with other you know former cia and especially military generals who were retired
[6:51:11.440 --> 6:51:17.200]  and they said they would make the biggest stink in all of history if clinton gave jonathan pollard
[6:51:17.200 --> 6:51:24.960]  a uh pardon so you know clinton was too afraid to do that he had already you know given these
[6:51:24.960 --> 6:51:31.120]  other crooks including drug dealers partners uh and natin yahoo recently asked barak obama
[6:51:31.120 --> 6:51:40.560]  now jonathan pollard will live like a multimillionaire uh in luxury uh in israel even though he's an
[6:51:40.560 --> 6:51:46.880]  american citizen because he did this great wonderful deed for israel but so you see that
[6:51:46.880 --> 6:51:53.760]  listen alex i think america should consider america first you know which president i think
[6:51:53.760 --> 6:51:58.560]  was george washington his farewell address told us not to have these entangling alliances
[6:51:59.360 --> 6:52:06.480]  or these passionate attachments it scared me to death when i found out recently that herman
[6:52:06.480 --> 6:52:13.520]  kane his big support comes from the very rich uh jewish coch brothers in new york did you know
[6:52:13.520 --> 6:52:21.360]  they flew herman kane to israel to be vetted out in the interview yeah now i didn't know that
[6:52:21.360 --> 6:52:27.040]  yeah yeah mark block uh flew to new york city and there's a couple there their last name is
[6:52:27.040 --> 6:52:33.600]  strober s t r o b e r uh and they they're the ones that wrote the book about herman kane this is
[6:52:33.600 --> 6:52:39.360]  herman kane he didn't write it himself this jewish couple did they're very uh um let's just say
[6:52:39.360 --> 6:52:45.760]  attached to israel uh and they arranged for him and his campaign manager this mark block
[6:52:45.760 --> 6:52:52.400]  who by the way the campaign manager mark block for herman kane is so crooked the wisconsin courts
[6:52:53.680 --> 6:52:59.280]  forbid him from for three years from even participating in campaigns in wisconsin because
[6:52:59.280 --> 6:53:04.880]  of the crooked stuff he had done but now he's herman that's why herman kane gets up and says
[6:53:04.880 --> 6:53:10.800]  you know i'll i'm a zionist and i'll do everything israel won't send you know be their big backer
[6:53:10.800 --> 6:53:17.360]  and all that i wish for once that people would just put america first listen i believe israel has
[6:53:17.360 --> 6:53:24.000]  a right to exist of course i i believe that it you know as a christian i've always loved the bible
[6:53:24.000 --> 6:53:31.680]  says whoever's the whosoever will may come that means of any race any national or ethnic group
[6:53:31.680 --> 6:53:37.600]  you know god is no respect for persons but i think as americans we owe it to our country to put our
[6:53:37.600 --> 6:53:44.720]  country first and it's only right that jonathan pollard stay in prison after giving 10 000 and
[6:53:44.720 --> 6:53:51.280]  in fact i want to know why we're giving all this aid money to israel when they gave 10 000 of our
[6:53:51.280 --> 6:53:57.920]  most classified documents that revealed our greatest military secrets to rid china well the

[6:59:52.880 --> 7:00:00.960]  it's info war's money bomb 2011 stay with us partner all right well welcome to the texas
[7:00:00.960 --> 7:00:05.920]  central command center deep behind enemy lines erin dykes is with me he just got through doing
[7:00:05.920 --> 7:00:11.280]  the nightly news and uh i just want to talk to you for a couple moments about well i guess the
[7:00:11.280 --> 7:00:17.520]  difference between this sort of broadcast compared to your typical mainstream media news outlet well
[7:00:17.520 --> 7:00:21.600]  i've been working here at info wars for more than five and a half years and it's really the simple
[7:00:21.600 --> 7:00:27.920]  difference of as in 1984 being able to admit two plus two is four whereas the mainstream media looks
[7:00:27.920 --> 7:00:32.160]  at things through a certain prism through the way it's scripted and they have to analyze things
[7:00:32.160 --> 7:00:37.520]  within that boat here we're able to essentially think freely try to figure out what's going on
[7:00:37.520 --> 7:00:43.920]  and we also are able to have you know the fortitude to say 9 11's an inside job to say
[7:00:43.920 --> 7:00:47.200]  what's really going on behind events as we see them and not have to
[7:00:47.760 --> 7:00:52.800]  curgitate government talking points not have to pretend that things are a way that they're not
[7:00:52.800 --> 7:00:57.120]  we're really revolutionary in the sense that we're trying to get back to the constitution
[7:00:57.120 --> 7:01:03.840]  that's been totally abandoned and as you people know from following alex it's it's an operation
[7:01:03.840 --> 7:01:08.560]  that's grown over the years i'd never meant to be on the news for instance but here i am doing the
[7:01:08.560 --> 7:01:13.360]  nightly news i've been doing a lot of research brought a lot of eugenics stuff to the material
[7:01:13.360 --> 7:01:18.480]  my mind has been awakened just from working here and sort of freely researching while doing all the
[7:01:18.480 --> 7:01:23.040]  daily tasks and and that's one of the main things i love about working with alex and this great
[7:01:23.040 --> 7:01:29.200]  operation here how important is it to get this message out right now well it's essential because
[7:01:29.200 --> 7:01:35.280]  things are coming to a head tonight we just covered the continuing crackdown on ordinary people placed
[7:01:35.280 --> 7:01:40.960]  under suspicion until they're proven not guilty that is what supposed law enforcement has come to
[7:01:40.960 --> 7:01:46.640]  represent everything is turned on its head in an alex and wonderland style way and we of course
[7:01:46.640 --> 7:01:52.480]  just have to get back to the constitution and the common sense of trying to be independent
[7:01:52.480 --> 7:01:58.000]  trying to lead normal lives i mean they're banning vegetables and vitamins and all the rest of it
[7:01:58.000 --> 7:02:03.760]  while pushing big pharma cancer cures and gmo's uh that could taint the whole earth i mean we're
[7:02:03.760 --> 7:02:09.520]  in a desperate situation here we know the agenda of the globalists and it's really true they're out
[7:02:09.520 --> 7:02:15.360]  for our entire lives so it now has to be the time for us to fight back because if not now
[7:02:15.360 --> 7:02:21.760]  we may not have a second chance well said what's it like to work with alex jones well it's incredible
[7:02:21.760 --> 7:02:28.160]  i mean alex is a mind behind the scenes on camera and everything and uh he's really allowed us a
[7:02:28.160 --> 7:02:32.880]  place to grow and develop our own minds and try to search for the truth something i feel like i've
[7:02:32.880 --> 7:02:38.240]  always been trying to do in my own way but it's really become focused here at umphal wars and
[7:02:38.240 --> 7:02:45.840]  it's a great thing for it alex is a real character uh and you know i think a lot of people out there
[7:02:45.840 --> 7:02:53.200]  have a feeling about alex from hearing him on the air that um if they met him in person that
[7:02:53.200 --> 7:03:03.840]  he might be mad at them but alex is mad at the new world order for you not he's not mad at you
[7:03:04.720 --> 7:03:09.600]  and what you learn when you work here and you're around alex enough is that he's one of the
[7:03:09.600 --> 7:03:15.520]  kindest funniest people you're ever gonna meet look at the evil i mean
[7:03:17.120 --> 7:03:22.880]  there it is everywhere this is decried republicans democrats mainline media they hate it
[7:03:23.440 --> 7:03:29.200]  here's some pizza here's some money he's the nice guy he's like let me come here i can
[7:03:29.200 --> 7:03:40.800]  let me tell you exactly but here's some pizza here's a little you can do that to make him be one
[7:03:40.800 --> 7:03:46.880]  good guy let me tell you you know we don't want you to be in the river so here we are
[7:03:47.760 --> 7:03:54.960]  and lord jakemson's office this is rob jakemson hey what was your role in the obama deception i
[7:03:54.960 --> 7:03:58.960]  know you've done a lot of production work here you've got the coolest office in the place and
[7:03:58.960 --> 7:04:06.560]  my opinion but tell us what you do i'm the editor basically i edited a bunch of the dvds all the
[7:04:06.560 --> 7:04:13.200]  primary dvds that alex released in the last four five years including obama deception which
[7:04:13.200 --> 7:04:19.280]  is yeah some of your best work tell us what it means to be an info warrior why you love this job
[7:04:19.280 --> 7:04:23.840]  why this job you know most everybody i talk to this job has a purpose yeah yeah it's more than
[7:04:23.840 --> 7:04:30.800]  just a job you know it's exciting to be able to do the work that i do to begin with you know but
[7:04:30.800 --> 7:04:37.680]  to be doing it here knowing that it gets out to millions of viewers and and it breaks the eyes
[7:04:37.680 --> 7:04:42.080]  for a lot of other viewers who's never seen this information before is a lot more rewarding than
[7:04:42.080 --> 7:04:50.560]  let's say editing a typical hollywood film or a typical tv show which really has meaningless and
[7:04:50.560 --> 7:04:56.960]  useless results and is meant to waste people's time this is the exact opposite i feel it it's not
[7:04:56.960 --> 7:05:03.520]  just it's it's empowering people when they use their time to watch these videos and it's rewarding
[7:05:03.520 --> 7:05:11.520]  to know that my work is is contributing to basically you know opening up people's minds
[7:05:11.520 --> 7:05:18.400]  and changing the paradigm because there's a war on for your mind there is for there is a war on
[7:05:18.400 --> 7:05:23.440]  for your mind all right man we'll keep up the good work always a pleasure i'm the graphics
[7:05:23.440 --> 7:05:29.040]  coordinator of the the nightly news show the money bomb last year helped launch the nightly news
[7:05:29.040 --> 7:05:36.880]  program and essentially helped bring me in i used to have to slave all day long at a job that i hated
[7:05:36.880 --> 7:05:44.000]  doing stuff i didn't believe in and uh i'd have to reserve my subversive talk for later around my
[7:05:44.000 --> 7:05:50.160]  friends who are usually too drunk to retain anything i told them and this job opportunity produced
[7:05:50.160 --> 7:05:57.520]  the opportunity for me to marriage my subversive talk with my daily job activities and uh now
[7:05:57.520 --> 7:06:04.160]  i get to speak my mind all day long and talk about stuff i believe in and use my powers for good
[7:06:04.160 --> 7:06:13.360]  so uh what is your title uh i am a lord inquisitor yeah yes now that wasn't on your business card
[7:06:13.360 --> 7:06:20.880]  but so it will be it will be yeah okay you're also the voice of edward bernay's i am the voice of
[7:06:20.880 --> 7:06:27.600]  edward bernay's we're here with matt the online store manager for the info warriors and um he's
[7:06:27.600 --> 7:06:33.520]  going to show us some of the products that we have on display for the money bomb and what what is
[7:06:33.520 --> 7:06:37.840]  look at this yeah throughout the year we get a bunch of different things people send in this is a
[7:06:37.840 --> 7:06:46.000]  board game um by it's www.bankstersbankwit.com they send in to us it's kind of like a monopoly game
[7:06:46.000 --> 7:06:51.280]  board game and then alex went in here when he was back in the warehouse signed it did a little extra
[7:06:51.280 --> 7:06:58.400]  artwork on it you know some devil horns and and mustaches so we're gonna put a whole variety
[7:06:58.400 --> 7:07:03.280]  items like this up on our ebay store and we also have alex took some time signed a bunch of his own
[7:07:03.280 --> 7:07:09.200]  dvds so we'll be putting those up on both our regular store and on ebay for some auction items so
[7:07:09.200 --> 7:07:13.760]  that's a great way to support the info wars all right tell us about this this is our peace day
[7:07:13.760 --> 7:07:19.760]  resistance um this was used by alex a couple years ago with the fall the republic dvd release
[7:07:19.760 --> 7:07:25.520]  did a promotional video and this is back when we were first expanding the warehouse area and just
[7:07:25.520 --> 7:07:31.440]  actually took out the wall just just next door to us here so you can go online and see the video
[7:07:31.440 --> 7:07:37.440]  of him just pounding it down it's got an info war sticker and signed by alex hey let's get a close
[7:07:37.440 --> 7:07:42.640]  up of that one right there you got alex's signature and then the uh the don't tread on me sticker
[7:07:42.640 --> 7:07:50.160]  up here which has been through some battle action there's also some um info wars drywall on this too
[7:07:50.160 --> 7:07:57.280]  so it's this is um battle tested by alex let's move on to some of the t-shirts that are selling
[7:07:57.280 --> 7:08:01.760]  well right now this is a new one i haven't seen yet we've been real busy adding a lot of new products
[7:08:01.760 --> 7:08:07.040]  to get the word out um this is a just got it in this week ideas are bulletproof we the people
[7:08:07.040 --> 7:08:11.440]  is kind of combines that that popular quote of ideas are bulletproof what's possibly the most
[7:08:11.440 --> 7:08:16.480]  bulletproof ideas there are the ideas in our constitution sure and um our other new shirt
[7:08:16.480 --> 7:08:21.760]  that's been just going off the shelves gi joe gi joe info wars because knowing this half the battle
[7:08:21.760 --> 7:08:27.280]  um that really sums up info wars gotta get the information out how important are these t-shirts
[7:08:27.280 --> 7:08:32.240]  these don't they they spark up conversation in my mind absolutely i cannot go to the grocery store
[7:08:32.240 --> 7:08:38.080]  i cannot go to a convenience store i'm driving down the road and i get thumbs up about my shirts
[7:08:38.080 --> 7:08:43.760]  i wear my shirts seven days a week to be walking the advertisement for info wars dot com i think
[7:08:43.760 --> 7:08:49.120]  it is very important that people at least dip into the website just to kind of get a little
[7:08:49.120 --> 7:08:54.640]  perspective on the truth because they don't realize that they're being brainwashed and lied to so
[7:08:54.640 --> 7:08:59.600]  these shirts are very very important as far as advertisement goes they're very catchy to the
[7:08:59.600 --> 7:09:05.120]  eye people tend to look at them and gravitate towards them i get asked questions you know so
[7:09:05.120 --> 7:09:09.200]  you could be like in a bank or in the grocery store and you've get complete strangers that
[7:09:09.200 --> 7:09:14.960]  will ask you questions about absolutely absolutely they'll ask me what is info wars what does that
[7:09:14.960 --> 7:09:19.520]  your shirt mean you know what is big brother you know there's people out there that are just
[7:09:19.520 --> 7:09:26.800]  totally clueless what's really going on and so these shirts are a really good way to advertise
[7:09:26.800 --> 7:09:33.600]  the truth you know so i make it a point to wear an info war shirt seven days a week yeah it's a
[7:09:33.600 --> 7:09:38.640]  great opportunity to educate the masses what does it mean to be an info warrior and doing what you
[7:09:38.640 --> 7:09:45.840]  do you know really i think the best way to sum it up is to go over past work experiences even in
[7:09:45.840 --> 7:09:51.200]  the most professional work environments there's always people that slough off and kind of don't
[7:09:51.200 --> 7:09:56.400]  take the utmost care and responsibility with the way that they conduct themselves but you don't
[7:09:56.400 --> 7:10:02.400]  find that anywhere here because every day no matter someone's tired look at how tirelessly
[7:10:02.400 --> 7:10:08.560]  alex works you know no matter what the circumstances are when they come into this office when they come
[7:10:08.560 --> 7:10:15.600]  through those doors they have a mission that they believe supersedes their own personal well-being
[7:10:15.600 --> 7:10:22.640]  and it that kind of drive makes such a cohesiveness in the office it is it's really an amazing thing
[7:10:22.640 --> 7:10:27.760]  to watch it's completely changed i will never do anything else for the rest of my life it is
[7:10:27.760 --> 7:10:33.520]  completely changed my idea of what it means to have a meaningful work i'm here with rob do he's
[7:10:33.520 --> 7:10:38.400]  a director for the info wars nightly news and tell us a little bit about the process of
[7:10:38.400 --> 7:10:43.920]  of getting this message out to the audience what goes into it how is it done well if you've been
[7:10:43.920 --> 7:10:49.360]  watching lately you you can see that the quickening is happening the the news stories come out every
[7:10:49.360 --> 7:10:56.480]  day and more insane world news and news that affects our freedoms is it continually comes
[7:10:56.480 --> 7:11:02.080]  out it pours out so what we do we look at info wars dot com see what's being posted from our
[7:11:02.080 --> 7:11:07.680]  writers we look at drudge report we look at our tips people send us in a lot of good tips you
[7:11:07.680 --> 7:11:12.720]  can send those to rob d at info wars dot com and so we put all this together and we look at what
[7:11:12.720 --> 7:11:17.120]  what do we want to show and we want to show as much as we can that's why we can't produce a 30
[7:11:17.120 --> 7:11:23.120]  minute show we just keep producing an hour an hour and 10 minutes because there's just so much news
[7:11:23.120 --> 7:11:29.440]  so we go through that we we split up the stories you know people take their own their own stories
[7:11:29.440 --> 7:11:34.480]  they they grab the videos off youtube make the full screens make the little graphics which we
[7:11:34.480 --> 7:11:40.560]  call the ot s that fits over top alex while he's talking about it and then we dump those out
[7:11:41.520 --> 7:11:46.080]  race to do it all day long because creating graphics in an hd format takes a lot longer
[7:11:46.080 --> 7:11:52.320]  you know than the old days when i used to do it for many dv and um so we get a fight with the
[7:11:52.320 --> 7:11:58.880]  machines well i want to be kind of nice to the machines but they are slow we've tried to get
[7:11:58.880 --> 7:12:03.120]  cards to make these things move faster they don't really move fast so we end up watching a lot of
[7:12:03.120 --> 7:12:07.840]  render bars and a lot of export bars we finally get all the stuff together we get it over here we
[7:12:07.840 --> 7:12:13.280]  get it in order we talk with alex make sure he's happy with it ready to go with it um usually we
[7:12:13.280 --> 7:12:19.200]  do the guest interview first we'll pre-record that and then the news sometimes we do it live sometimes
[7:12:19.200 --> 7:12:24.880]  we pre-recorded if we have the time and both sometimes we do both and then uh and you know
[7:12:24.880 --> 7:12:28.480]  then we do the show and get it out to the people and you know we've really been working hard trying
[7:12:28.480 --> 7:12:33.520]  to get a lot of different systems together working together so uh when alex is talking it doesn't
[7:12:33.520 --> 7:12:40.800]  look like a bad kung fu movie and um you know so that it's been a lot of fun it's been a long two
[7:12:40.800 --> 7:12:45.520]  months i'll tell you that and i i i definitely feel the two months and we've only done two months
[7:12:45.520 --> 7:12:51.440]  and i can't believe it so we're looking forward to to to keep bringing it to the people the news
[7:12:51.440 --> 7:12:58.160]  that's uncensored that is uh from a perspective of freedom and liberty not from a perspective of
[7:12:58.160 --> 7:13:03.520]  control and uh and and being a sheep and you know we're going to keep doing it we're hopefully we
[7:13:03.520 --> 7:13:08.480]  can expand with this money bomb is what we really need your support so uh go to info wars money bomb

[7:17:30.880 --> 7:17:35.040]  view of info wars dot com and and i want your honest response because i didn't talk to you
[7:17:35.040 --> 7:17:38.720]  beforehand i didn't tell you i was gonna do this what is your view of this operation and what we
[7:17:38.720 --> 7:17:44.320]  cover well when i first started working here info wars dot com i didn't really know much about it
[7:17:44.320 --> 7:17:51.360]  um i had heard uh i'd watched one dvd of yours um it seemed we were kind of small time when i first
[7:17:51.360 --> 7:17:57.040]  started here alex i mean we we i came in here and it seemed like things were just really small
[7:17:57.040 --> 7:18:02.400]  we're in that small place five six people five six people i mean it looks like orders weren't going
[7:18:02.400 --> 7:18:10.080]  out but uh you know but but there was a there was a hardcore small audience audience that's why i hired
[7:18:10.080 --> 7:18:16.000]  you was to get it in gear get it going uh it man i talk about the growth and just what these money
[7:18:16.000 --> 7:18:20.160]  bombs are for i know this is the fourth one we've had and i've been here for every one of them
[7:18:20.160 --> 7:18:26.560]  and and let me tell the audience every one of these money bombs has launched us to a new level
[7:18:26.560 --> 7:18:31.840]  i mean we went from a little bitty place almost maybe three times the size of this little studio
[7:18:31.840 --> 7:18:39.840]  we're in the room we're in here to substantially larger you know and a lot some more departments
[7:18:39.840 --> 7:18:46.480]  the marketing has grown uh the the warehouse has grown i mean the products have grown we've got the
[7:18:46.480 --> 7:18:51.200]  tv thing going now and every year it's just been a step step step step i mean it's grown so much
[7:18:51.840 --> 7:18:55.840]  my view of info wars is that we're going all the way we're going to get the word out
[7:18:55.840 --> 7:18:59.600]  and everyone here is pumped up about it and i know there's tons of people out there i meet people
[7:18:59.600 --> 7:19:05.360]  everywhere i go alex i play shows everyone i i don't bring up where i work during the day but
[7:19:05.360 --> 7:19:08.880]  i hear people talking about it and then every now and i'll tell them they're like well it's awesome
[7:19:08.880 --> 7:19:12.960]  and they want to talk about it and everybody wants to talk about what's going on in the world people
[7:19:12.960 --> 7:19:18.880]  well that's an illustration of the of the huge effect we're having and it's so exciting and it
[7:19:18.880 --> 7:19:24.240]  just shows that when you put your passion into something it ends up having an effect now briefly
[7:19:24.240 --> 7:19:28.320]  you got on the air force five years ago came to work with us you've done an incredible job
[7:19:28.320 --> 7:19:33.040]  helped turn around so much of what we've done well then i mean you're just surprised to be at this
[7:19:33.040 --> 7:19:36.960]  office and you know on top of what you do at night you know playing guitar and singing you're about
[7:19:36.960 --> 7:19:42.800]  to get that in a moment but expanding on that you were telling me and i wouldn't look this up it was
[7:19:42.800 --> 7:19:47.280]  true about all your buddies that are still in the air force they're all moving over to drones
[7:19:47.280 --> 7:19:52.800]  you were the guy fixing the f-16s loading missiles on them now all those guys are learning how to fly
[7:19:52.800 --> 7:19:58.640]  drones yeah there's a huge career field i guess opening up for unmanned drones i was just telling
[7:19:58.640 --> 7:20:02.400]  alex that to the day i got a couple friends that have moved over that you know they're still in a
[7:20:02.400 --> 7:20:08.560]  lot of my buddies we've all gotten out uh some for good reason some for uh you know bad but uh
[7:20:08.560 --> 7:20:15.040]  yeah no there's just a lot of unmanned drones uh people out there going to that career field

[7:22:21.760 --> 7:22:29.120]  a lover loves but who's to blame and any one man knows a long hard road
[7:22:29.120 --> 7:22:34.160]  oh is any woman she can tell you so
[7:22:38.960 --> 7:22:41.840]  without a love it's a mystery
[7:22:47.200 --> 7:22:50.960]  truth in her the one it says
[7:22:50.960 --> 7:22:54.480]  yes
[7:22:55.680 --> 7:22:58.640]  play the game you pay the price
[7:23:03.520 --> 7:23:10.480]  one heart's gone and just one love dies
[7:23:10.480 --> 7:23:14.000]  yes
[7:23:17.600 --> 7:23:25.200]  you know true that's us to know that's myself a thousand times so you might say
[7:23:26.640 --> 7:23:34.000]  that the feelings they reach down inside you send you down a road that seldom seen
[7:23:34.000 --> 7:23:37.520]  me
[7:23:38.640 --> 7:23:41.760]  but without a love it's just a mystery
[7:23:47.120 --> 7:23:50.640]  truth in her the one it says
[7:23:55.600 --> 7:23:58.720]  play the game you pay the price
[7:23:58.720 --> 7:24:02.240]  yes

[7:24:49.520 --> 7:24:53.760]  i think about the way things that could have been
[7:24:53.760 --> 7:25:02.080]  because of where it was it was so special
[7:25:05.920 --> 7:25:10.080]  just so molly didn't work out in the end
[7:25:14.880 --> 7:25:17.760]  without a love it's just a mystery
[7:25:17.760 --> 7:25:19.280]  yes
[7:25:23.120 --> 7:25:26.080]  truth in her the one it says
[7:25:31.520 --> 7:25:34.560]  play the game you pay the price
[7:25:34.560 --> 7:25:44.880]  one heart's gone and just one love dies
[7:25:47.840 --> 7:25:53.280]  yeah yeah well one love dies
[7:25:56.000 --> 7:26:00.400]  oh well one love
[7:26:00.400 --> 7:26:02.720]  oh
[7:26:04.160 --> 7:26:12.720]  yeah yeah
[7:26:23.840 --> 7:26:28.240]  yeah title track here off the newest record there one heart's gone well then you have
[7:26:28.240 --> 7:26:34.160]  got an electro voice microphone that's it normally even the acoustic they've had three or four mics
[7:26:34.160 --> 7:26:41.360]  that was awesome i mean you are so talented with one damn microphone that is powerful music now
[7:26:41.360 --> 7:26:44.960]  it's a good microphone now now now again what i like about your music because i'm a big country
[7:26:44.960 --> 7:26:50.960]  music fan i like country and western i like it all uh as they say the blues brothers is that
[7:26:50.960 --> 7:26:56.800]  that kind of sounds randy travis type but even better but then you've kind of got some other
[7:26:56.800 --> 7:27:03.360]  influences what are the main influences on your music well the first thing i tell people is you
[7:27:03.360 --> 7:27:10.800]  know it's a heavily roots influence traditional uh country sound with a with what i call a modern
[7:27:10.800 --> 7:27:16.000]  approach to it you know i gotta have my own little artistic twist to it there uh but my
[7:27:16.000 --> 7:27:22.560]  influences have probably come a lot from uh you know merrill haggard's number one uh gary stewart
[7:27:22.560 --> 7:27:27.040]  is a i'm a huge fan of his you know and i know a lot of folks around here in texas know who gary
[7:27:27.040 --> 7:27:32.320]  stewart is and other than that he is you know weyland jennings and the white yokem also as well
[7:27:33.280 --> 7:27:39.120]  big time to white fan so what's amazing is you can sound like all those guys but not like a copy
[7:27:39.120 --> 7:27:43.280]  you like add something to it i've heard you do songs that sound like the white yokem love him
[7:27:43.280 --> 7:27:48.960]  love merrill haggard uh love weyland jennings love me love it all yeah i mean you can really do it
[7:27:48.960 --> 7:27:53.840]  all i mean i well that's what we do too if you come out and see us live you know i got a really
[7:27:53.840 --> 7:27:59.120]  good band right now and uh that's some of like you know the covers we like to do is a lot of those
[7:27:59.120 --> 7:28:04.400]  type guys but we do it our own kind of way you know we we we put our own uh original feel to it
[7:28:04.400 --> 7:28:08.080]  no exactly you're not just copying somebody it's not a cover band it's got a twist to it
[7:28:08.080 --> 7:28:12.640]  okay you're gonna play one more of yours and then who knows what the surprise is somebody
[7:28:12.640 --> 7:28:16.720]  else's you can play four or five if you want well then uh what's coming up next well i wanted to do
[7:28:16.720 --> 7:28:21.760]  a merrill haggard song for you because i know alex is a big fan of what i call real country music
[7:28:21.760 --> 7:28:29.040]  going downhill like a snowball headed for hell last year we had uh um alex singing a good merrill
[7:28:29.040 --> 7:28:36.400]  total torture with going downhill like a snowball headed for hell but uh yeah uh but i know alex
[7:28:36.400 --> 7:28:41.280]  is a big fan of what i call real country and that's merrill haggard if you had to ask me and so i
[7:28:42.240 --> 7:28:45.520]  jaren was actually singing this before i came in here so i gotta play for him as well
[7:28:45.520 --> 7:28:54.400]  the first thing i remember now was a long song with so blue and that a youngest dream growing up to
[7:28:54.400 --> 7:29:04.320]  ride on a freight train leaving town not knowing where i'm bound no one changed my mind but mama
[7:29:04.320 --> 7:29:13.920]  tried wanting only a rebel child from a family meek and mild where my mama seemed to know what
[7:29:13.920 --> 7:29:23.360]  lay in store despite all my son did learn from the bad i kept on turning till mama she couldn't
[7:29:23.360 --> 7:29:34.160]  hold me anymore and i turned 21 in prison doing life without parole well no one's still me right
[7:29:34.160 --> 7:29:42.160]  but mama tried mama tried mama tried to raise me better the play tonight and i had
[7:29:42.160 --> 7:29:51.120]  to leave only me to blame because mama tried their old daddy rested so left my mom heavy
[7:29:51.120 --> 7:30:01.120]  low as she tried so very hard just to fill issues working hours without rest wanted me to have
[7:30:01.120 --> 7:30:12.240]  the best she tried to raise me right but i refused and i turned 21 prison doing life without parole
[7:30:12.240 --> 7:30:19.680]  well no one's still me right but mama tried mama tried mama tried to raise me better
[7:30:20.720 --> 7:30:28.800]  the play tonight night that leaves only me to blame because mama tried and that leaves only
[7:30:28.800 --> 7:30:40.720]  me to blame because mama tried i'm liking that god almighty well then you got your tongue
[7:30:40.720 --> 7:30:45.120]  listen i haven't know a little about sound you got one microphone in here an electro voice
[7:30:45.120 --> 7:30:49.680]  you didn't even aim it down at your at your guitar and it sounds like a studio recording
[7:30:49.680 --> 7:30:54.560]  i tell you the folks are getting some real texas country here right now that's something like it
[7:30:54.560 --> 7:31:00.480]  all right you got one more yours right you want to play another one uh another somebody
[7:31:00.480 --> 7:31:04.480]  else's or one of yours yeah i want to do some of uh the stuff you like i know you like jonah
[7:31:04.480 --> 7:31:08.880]  cash and all that kind of yeah but whenever you want man i know it's good it's a good
[7:31:08.880 --> 7:31:14.000]  have to have your i'll tell you what i'll do uh one of the most honky talk sounding things i got
[7:31:14.000 --> 7:31:19.440]  on uh the new record uh it's a song called i'm still here because by the way you know i'm on
[7:31:19.440 --> 7:31:22.880]  a bs or you you've been around here you know i'm gonna be up give me honest thing i'll be
[7:31:22.880 --> 7:31:29.280]  us or no alex is pretty upfront i let me tell you i get so addicted to stuff i grew up as
[7:31:29.280 --> 7:31:33.040]  as a kid driving around with family and stuff and i love old stuff you need grow up with
[7:31:33.040 --> 7:31:37.440]  something here kid you like it this is one of the few all three of your records i put them in
[7:31:37.440 --> 7:31:42.160]  my car i listen to them i like every new track i mean you really are talented well then you're
[7:31:42.160 --> 7:31:47.840]  kicking ass here so i it's sure i want to hear you sing some oldy goody but i also like to hear
[7:31:47.840 --> 7:31:51.760]  your new stuff i tell you i'm gonna do one off that one then uh you know that one i did earlier
[7:31:51.760 --> 7:31:57.360]  was kind of had a little more modern sound to it and this one here is one that is probably
[7:31:57.360 --> 7:32:03.040]  the most traditional good little two-stepping sounding song on uh on the new record and of
[7:32:03.040 --> 7:32:07.680]  course it's your typical old country sounding thing too is kind of sad but a little song called i'm
[7:32:07.680 --> 7:32:25.760]  still here it's ran its course that's what you say
[7:32:25.760 --> 7:32:36.160]  yeah because i'm not the man i was the day we met
[7:32:38.880 --> 7:32:49.280]  and we both decided to play in love's game but i can tell by the score
[7:32:49.280 --> 7:33:02.560]  that it's me losing again but i'm still here yes i'm still holding on
[7:33:05.440 --> 7:33:14.000]  and i'm still me no matter if you think of the man i once was is gone
[7:33:14.000 --> 7:33:28.880]  and here we lay together now so close but bar it seems i'm still here but it's clear
[7:33:28.880 --> 7:33:45.280]  that you're not here with me
[7:33:49.120 --> 7:33:55.280]  the nights seem longer the day is the same
[7:33:55.280 --> 7:34:04.240]  each time we try to talk you just walk away
[7:34:07.120 --> 7:34:17.920]  and i'd give anything just to read your mind so i guess when you decide it's time
[7:34:17.920 --> 7:34:30.080]  that you leave our love to die but i'm still here yes i'm still holding on
[7:34:32.800 --> 7:34:41.520]  and i'm still me no matter if you think of the man i once was is gone
[7:34:41.520 --> 7:34:56.160]  and here we lay together now so close but bar it seems i'm still here but it's clear
[7:34:56.160 --> 7:35:11.760]  that you're not here with me i'm still here but it's clear that you're not here with me

[7:40:59.200 --> 7:41:05.520]  the point is at the end of the day i don't give a holy goblin you know what all i know is i want to
[7:41:05.520 --> 7:41:13.840]  hire a couple reporters some more video editors some researchers that's a good 300 gram i want to
[7:41:13.840 --> 7:41:19.920]  year a year a year and then everybody becomes like my friends i want to keep keeping them hired
[7:41:19.920 --> 7:41:26.480]  and then i want to buy a bunch of this equipment we got to get and we can probably still get that
[7:41:26.480 --> 7:41:32.480]  equipment i've just got to then not do other projects like giving bumper stickers away at cost
[7:41:32.480 --> 7:41:38.720]  or selling videos at cost or every day the sales guys come in they go okay here's your three or four
[7:41:38.720 --> 7:41:44.240]  plugs for the day this will make two thousand dollars and i don't do it because i'm too busy
[7:41:44.240 --> 7:41:49.760]  ranting insanely i mean to be honest these money bombs basically come down to me not doing the
[7:41:49.760 --> 7:41:58.160]  sponsorship like i'm supposed to i mean if you want to get honest so i will tell you right now
[7:41:59.120 --> 7:42:07.840]  i do not want guilt when i eat a dinner or buy gas or give a crew member a bonus or something
[7:42:07.840 --> 7:42:13.360]  because this is all about mission if you don't have a bunch of money i do not want your donation
[7:42:13.360 --> 7:42:17.920]  okay do not want it don't give it and of course it's always people that have nothing that want
[7:42:17.920 --> 7:42:22.880]  to give something that's because their souls are good if you are middle class or wealthy
[7:42:22.880 --> 7:42:28.480]  and you like what you see here and you want to see better equipment better information more crew
[7:42:28.480 --> 7:42:37.440]  everything then donate to info wars money bomb dot com or call 8882533139 i mean holy mackerel we
[7:42:37.440 --> 7:42:43.120]  got some great folks back there that are answering the phones taking your calls taking your donations
[7:42:43.120 --> 7:42:55.040]  and i'm just humbled by everybody supporting us i can never cover myself on internet tv
[7:42:55.680 --> 7:43:01.600]  not been on national tv everything else this is a ridiculous spectacle i mean doesn't everybody
[7:43:01.600 --> 7:43:08.960]  know the government putting up street lights with microphones and cameras wrong i mean you need me
[7:43:08.960 --> 7:43:15.040]  to tell you this is wrong look i know you don't need me to tell you this is wrong you know it's
[7:43:15.040 --> 7:43:19.840]  wrong but we're here to put out this signal so you can copy the videos and the show and the
[7:43:19.840 --> 7:43:25.920]  website and give it to people i got it okay i mean i'm like a like a damn toilet attendant or
[7:43:25.920 --> 7:43:32.480]  something i mean this should not be hard to figure out um i don't like to fail though
[7:43:32.480 --> 7:43:38.240]  you know our biggest money bomb has been four hundred thirty seven thousand dollars which sounds
[7:43:38.240 --> 7:43:44.320]  like a lot it's nothing uh when you've got all these crew members and all this bandwidth and
[7:43:44.320 --> 7:43:51.280]  all these systems but every dollar you give us goes to the fight because you know i sell videos
[7:43:51.280 --> 7:43:57.200]  or have sponsors i keep some of that money for me but whenever i have a money bomb 100% of it
[7:43:57.200 --> 7:44:03.040]  i mean i i budgeted i put in a bank account and it all goes to cameras and equipment and crew member
[7:44:03.040 --> 7:44:08.800]  and we've got such a platform built here that it's quite frankly scary what we can do in the
[7:44:08.800 --> 7:44:16.720]  next few years it's amazing so again i want to say i love you at your sweethearts uh those of
[7:44:16.720 --> 7:44:22.080]  you that have given to this money bomb and given to other money bombs and uh those of you that are
[7:44:22.080 --> 7:44:29.200]  just watching the video streams on the web uh all of you i mean it's just incredible to see what

[7:45:29.520 --> 7:45:36.320]  with a bullhorn and stuff i'm like this is not fun and so i didn't get very much i got a couple
[7:45:36.320 --> 7:45:41.280]  paintings done and we'll see what happens with that but i just can't do it hell i may just go
[7:45:41.280 --> 7:45:48.000]  back throw that original pen and ink and auction that sucker off not that i even it's kind of like
[7:45:48.000 --> 7:45:53.200]  raising the capital to run this operation it's like at the gas station you just shove the thing in
[7:45:54.080 --> 7:46:00.400]  pay the money and pump the gas into the deal but it is the funding of this operation that makes
[7:46:00.400 --> 7:46:07.040]  this possible at the end of the day now what i want to do because we've got mr corbett coming up
[7:46:07.040 --> 7:46:15.840]  in about 15 minutes is we've we've got a few of these darin mcbrane reports we haven't aired
[7:46:17.040 --> 7:46:23.440]  uh an example what we're doing with the nightly news and then we've got uh here on top of that
[7:46:24.400 --> 7:46:29.520]  we've got a bunch of uh actual reports i did on the nightly news we've watched thanks to all of
[7:46:29.520 --> 7:46:37.920]  your support and help so what should we air first alex jones talker speech that takes 30 minutes
[7:46:37.920 --> 7:46:43.680]  we can't do then alex jones on the royal wedding that's a real classic that's only eight minutes
[7:46:43.680 --> 7:46:50.560]  long maybe we should too have alex jones on the royal flatulence and then we'll uh come back talking
[7:46:50.560 --> 7:46:56.160]  about the hereditary transylvania vampires and then we'll go to mr corbett of the corporate report
[7:46:56.160 --> 7:47:02.000]  joining us from japan hey if you want to see even more power packed attacks on the globalist
[7:47:02.000 --> 7:47:08.480]  donate spread the word about the show buy my dvds or get a free copy make copies of it get it out
[7:47:08.480 --> 7:47:14.880]  aired on access tv it's having a big effect the end of the day my problem is is these globalists
[7:47:14.880 --> 7:47:19.920]  are such worms you know when i was actually 15 years ago still a little concerned about them
[7:47:20.480 --> 7:47:25.520]  and when i actually cared a little bit and actually worried about my life things were much
[7:47:25.520 --> 7:47:32.400]  funner i mean i'll be honest with you now i mean i just don't even give a damn these people are
[7:47:32.400 --> 7:47:37.120]  literally one inch maggots and as far as i'm concerned as soon as you wake up we're gonna kick
[7:47:37.120 --> 7:47:41.440]  the living hell out of them you know what i mean i mean i'm just waiting for humanity to wake up
[7:47:41.440 --> 7:47:46.800]  and come in for the big win i mean this is really a joke to me that a bunch of mental midget pygmy
[7:47:46.800 --> 7:47:52.320]  pieces of crap are taking control of our society and gangraping as i've quite frankly had enough of it
[7:47:52.320 --> 7:47:57.840]  so maybe i should just sit back in this position for the rest of the evening because all i know is
[7:47:59.440 --> 7:48:03.680]  what's that sounds good like this
[7:48:06.160 --> 7:48:11.040]  the crew kind of likes this i can start doing the radio show this way let me tell you something
[7:48:11.040 --> 7:48:16.720]  new world order trash i feel like i'm singing that rap hey baby how you doing down there right now
[7:48:16.720 --> 7:48:23.760]  uh yeah you know i had any sleep you know my problem is it's usually i go to bed i go to
[7:48:23.760 --> 7:48:30.560]  bed like midnight wake up at seven a.m six a.m perfectly last night i had no sleep and uh i
[7:48:30.560 --> 7:48:36.000]  woke up about four a.m oh yeah about seven i tried to go back to sleep but it didn't work
[7:48:36.960 --> 7:48:43.520]  and then i was thinking about janet napolitano a planet ruled by a demonic goblin dwarf a literal
[7:48:43.520 --> 7:48:47.760]  bucket of rat droppings and uh
[7:48:50.400 --> 7:48:56.160]  then i realized i was crazy like alex jones i mean so damn crazy jessie venter is calling me
[7:48:56.160 --> 7:49:00.000]  up during the breaks you know what i mean i mean that's pretty damn crazy when you actually believe
[7:49:00.000 --> 7:49:05.360]  that's happening and it's not of course it is happening uh and davis stains calling you up
[7:49:05.360 --> 7:49:11.360]  you know it just and jen charlie shane calls up i mean at that point it gets really damn weird um
[7:49:11.360 --> 7:49:15.680]  um i think i should take a break about this point right now
[7:49:19.120 --> 7:49:30.320]  uh what about this new microphone system if i do like this it looks very commanding i mean
[7:49:31.040 --> 7:49:32.000]  you know honestly
[7:49:34.720 --> 7:49:40.240]  honestly i wish that other people stepped to the plate and there was some person better than me
[7:49:40.240 --> 7:49:49.840]  because let me tell you looking down on alex jones this is one pathetic piece of garbage
[7:49:51.680 --> 7:49:58.160]  but i mean compared to everybody else resisting i'm king of the hill so all of you out there that
[7:49:58.160 --> 7:50:04.000]  think you can do a better job than me step up right now because you know what i'm tired of it
[7:50:04.000 --> 7:50:09.360]  the crown is heavy as they say and i ask you now instead of infighting with each other and all
[7:50:09.360 --> 7:50:17.200]  the co-intel pro crap show me what you can do build an operation build a tv show build a radio show
[7:50:17.200 --> 7:50:24.160]  reach millions of people a day start doing it do it do it do it do it i am ready to put my full

[7:51:45.440 --> 7:51:51.040]  blood pumping nuclear power brain damage in fours dot com big news out of london cross the
[7:51:51.040 --> 7:51:56.160]  wires what right around six a.m. finally finally that's right friends william and kate middleton

[7:52:00.080 --> 7:52:04.960]  in london there is a statement out of buckingham palace queen elizabeth said she is absolutely
[7:52:04.960 --> 7:52:12.240]  delighted for her grandson and his bride to be the united states was founded on july 4th 1776
[7:52:12.240 --> 7:52:19.920]  in resistance to the hegemonic despotic tyrannical rule of king george the third and the abuse
[7:52:19.920 --> 7:52:26.000]  against the colonies and most of the british parliament was against going to war with their
[7:52:26.000 --> 7:52:33.120]  fellow englishmen because the king was unpopular there as well it was known that he was a german
[7:52:33.120 --> 7:52:40.240]  king his father being brought over to rule england these people could barely speak english i think
[7:52:40.240 --> 7:52:46.080]  it gets germans but you don't see me going over to germany to rule them the very essence of july
[7:52:46.080 --> 7:52:54.400]  4th and 1776 is resistance to the disgusting house of wednesday they didn't get that name until around
[7:52:54.400 --> 7:52:59.760]  world war one because before that they were known as the sax coberg gophus notice that we hear their
[7:52:59.760 --> 7:53:06.080]  names prince william you never hear his last name do you the slave public many other than england
[7:53:06.080 --> 7:53:10.480]  who support these people don't even know their last names because they don't want you knowing
[7:53:10.480 --> 7:53:17.440]  their last names three times the last three years the parliament in canada hasn't done what the queen
[7:53:17.440 --> 7:53:24.160]  of england wants so she suspended them shut down the parliament happened in the late 70s in australia
[7:53:24.160 --> 7:53:30.640]  this is a tyrannical group pushing eugenics population reduction all the carbon taxes
[7:53:30.640 --> 7:53:36.800]  uh prince philip the queen's husband another german royal prince uh is a supporter of eugenics his
[7:53:36.800 --> 7:53:43.440]  cousin uh who was uh the prince married to the queen of the netherlands unadmitted nazi unadmitted
[7:53:43.440 --> 7:53:50.240]  eugenicist the point is these are the most filthy degenerate people you can imagine she owns more
[7:53:50.240 --> 7:53:56.000]  than half of canada more than half the land in england and then she's paid by the government for
[7:53:56.000 --> 7:54:03.520]  her palaces and all the rest of it it's disgusting and to watch us television fawning fox cnn cbs all
[7:54:03.520 --> 7:54:08.880]  of them oh it's so wonderful no one in america wait until next week the way they're hyping it
[7:54:12.720 --> 7:54:17.040]  one week until the royal wedding this is an exciting stuff i mean it's it's hard i mean the
[7:54:17.040 --> 7:54:21.200]  energy is just palpable tongue couples get married they're just hoping that some bank will be nice
[7:54:21.200 --> 7:54:26.080]  enough to give them a mortgage yeah these folks have a number of palaces to pick from nbc's is
[7:54:26.080 --> 7:54:32.800]  launching a free royal wedding app for the ipad gotta this is truly a love story that captures
[7:54:32.800 --> 7:54:38.800]  everybody's attention this goes back to ebb and bernice a hundred years ago saying look to make
[7:54:38.800 --> 7:54:43.840]  politicians and royalty popular we'll have hollywood stars come to banquets and events with them
[7:54:43.840 --> 7:54:50.080]  we'll have music stars we'll have other people go there to basically make these elites be seen as
[7:54:50.080 --> 7:54:56.080]  celebrities themselves you know why america was founded because under the imperial royal system in
[7:54:56.080 --> 7:55:01.600]  europe and england if you weren't part of the inside group who had basically the patronage
[7:55:02.320 --> 7:55:08.400]  of the crown where they gave you land houses jobs you couldn't even get a license to be a carpenter
[7:55:08.400 --> 7:55:15.280]  a license to be a blacksmith a license to brew beer unless their local lords gave you the authorization
[7:55:15.280 --> 7:55:21.200]  so it wasn't just that you had to pay outrageous taxes you had to get their permission to even
[7:55:21.760 --> 7:55:27.840]  have a job to have a profession ladies and gentlemen that's the essence of globalism
[7:55:27.840 --> 7:55:33.920]  is big mega corporations many of which are owned and controlled by the german royal family that
[7:55:33.920 --> 7:55:39.680]  runs england and of course other netherlands the whole system they've set up and they promote is
[7:55:39.680 --> 7:55:44.880]  about this new global corporate system worldwide that through government power shuts down their
[7:55:44.880 --> 7:55:51.600]  competition and transfers the people's wealth through taxes to the offshore cartels these people
[7:55:51.600 --> 7:55:58.800]  are parasites they're disgusting they're filthy and if we want to reclaim the spirit of 1776 we
[7:55:58.800 --> 7:56:05.600]  should realize how abhorrent monarchy is in all of its forms and that includes the un and the new
[7:56:05.600 --> 7:56:13.840]  royalty uh under the unelected eu bureaucratic system where over 80 of england's laws even though
[7:56:13.840 --> 7:56:20.240]  they're not part of the eu are made by eu bureaucrats please everyone remember the spirit of 1776
[7:56:20.240 --> 7:56:24.320]  and a lot of folks in england are saying they're going to go out and protest it first the government
[7:56:24.320 --> 7:56:28.800]  said you've got the day off slaves you don't have to go to work on the you know big royal wedding
[7:56:28.800 --> 7:56:33.920]  coming up next week and then the republicans that's a group that want to get rid of the monarchy in
[7:56:33.920 --> 7:56:38.080]  england said we're going to protest in the streets and the government said you're not allowed to
[7:56:38.080 --> 7:56:44.720]  protest meanwhile they criticize syria for banning protest so anytime you see some mind numb zombie
[7:56:44.720 --> 7:56:49.680]  talking about how exciting the wedding is or how they watched it you're watching a bunch of twitly
[7:56:49.680 --> 7:56:55.760]  inbred idiots that can't even dress themselves and have valets and until just a few decades ago
[7:56:55.760 --> 7:57:00.000]  they try to keep it quiet they have people that wipe their butts for them groom of the stool
[7:57:00.800 --> 7:57:06.720]  do you know the history of america do you know it started in resistance to this very usurping
[7:57:06.720 --> 7:57:12.640]  german family who aren't even british do you know that most the english hate the royal family
[7:57:12.640 --> 7:57:16.880]  do you know they have a secret police system that basically threatens people that talk about
[7:57:16.880 --> 7:57:21.680]  getting rid of the monarchy do you know that princess diana on record told her butler and
[7:57:21.680 --> 7:57:26.880]  others i made a videotape saying prince charles has threatened me he's going to kill me in a fake
[7:57:26.880 --> 7:57:34.560]  auto accident these people are absolutely anathema and the servile folks that have been raised to
[7:57:34.560 --> 7:57:39.440]  worship these people and all the little old ladies that think it's cute well that's why we're enslaved
[7:57:39.440 --> 7:57:42.800]  that's why our country's bankrupt that's why we're going to hell in a handbasket because you've
[7:57:42.800 --> 7:57:47.840]  forgotten what it is to be an american or perhaps you were never even taught but now you're going
[7:57:47.840 --> 7:57:56.400]  to learn what it's like to be a subject a slave what is royalty royalty is kim jung ill in north
[7:57:56.400 --> 7:58:02.400]  korea his father took over and then gave him power and now he's giving power to his son
[7:58:02.400 --> 7:58:08.640]  why don't they just put gold crowns on their heads and dress up with long flowing robes maybe
[7:58:08.640 --> 7:58:14.560]  then americans would celebrate the royal wedding of kim jung ill's son oh but they wear little
[7:58:14.560 --> 7:58:20.480]  military uniforms and we know how clownish it is but somehow we've been tricked at wearing big gold
[7:58:20.480 --> 7:58:26.560]  crowns and flowing robes isn't more ridiculous and stupid america has been great because it's not
[7:58:26.560 --> 7:58:32.560]  about what race you are what family pedigree or how murderous your great granddaddy was it's about
[7:58:32.560 --> 7:58:37.520]  what you individually can do it's about what you individually have to offer being an inventor a
[7:58:37.520 --> 7:58:43.120]  trailblazer and explore someone who's brave an artist someone who has incredible literature in

[7:59:08.320 --> 7:59:13.120]  understand this is mainline history the king of england had to advocate at the beginning of world
[7:59:13.120 --> 7:59:18.960]  war two because he wanted to merge with hitler the british royal family come from a long line of
[7:59:18.960 --> 7:59:25.680]  dictators they're oppressive they're anti-liberty and freedom and here it is all over the british

[8:00:36.480 --> 8:00:42.640]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[8:00:42.640 --> 8:00:48.640]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all
[8:00:48.640 --> 8:00:54.640]  of us as american citizens to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[8:00:54.640 --> 8:01:01.120]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[8:01:01.120 --> 8:01:06.480]  world government tim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[8:01:06.480 --> 8:01:11.200]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[8:01:11.200 --> 8:01:18.800]  washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd
[8:01:18.800 --> 8:01:34.720]  at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot tv
[8:02:01.040 --> 8:02:08.240]  jungle life i'm far away from the world on my own like ties and boy
[8:02:09.760 --> 8:02:16.880]  hide and seek i plan on where i should cross the forest monkey business on this tiny afternoon
[8:02:16.880 --> 8:02:27.680]  like a light i'm living in the open may you think that there is a burning
[8:02:27.680 --> 8:02:48.480]  man i find a blood just to the sky i wonder there's a message yet to you
[8:02:57.680 --> 8:03:14.480]  night tonight
[8:03:28.000 --> 8:03:32.480]  there is no question that we have made many important strides in securing
[8:03:32.480 --> 8:03:40.480]  our country from terrorism since 9 11
[8:03:40.480 --> 8:03:57.280]  but the threat continues to evolve
[8:04:00.080 --> 8:04:05.600]  and in some ways the threat today may be at its most heightened state since the attacks
[8:04:05.600 --> 8:04:12.080]  nearly 10 years ago but i think if you just take those three pieces of evidence right there in ai
[8:04:12.080 --> 8:04:17.680]  two plus two plus two you have the u.s government letting moots a lab on the plane with an intentionally
[8:04:17.680 --> 8:04:25.120]  defective bomb the war on terror is a fraud and it's being used in a manner to take away your
[8:04:25.120 --> 8:04:31.280]  rights for whatever reason in addition to the core al-qaeda group which still represents a threat to
[8:04:31.280 --> 8:04:36.960]  the united states despite its diminished capabilities we now face threats from a number of al-qaeda
[8:04:36.960 --> 8:04:44.240]  associates that share its violent extremist ideology among these groups we are also seeing an
[8:04:44.240 --> 8:04:48.960]  increased emphasis on recruiting americans and westners to carry out attacks
[8:04:53.920 --> 8:04:59.360]  they are also encouraging individuals in the west to carry out their own small-scale attacks
[8:04:59.360 --> 8:05:05.200]  which require less of the coordination and planning that could raise red flags and lead to an attacks
[8:05:05.200 --> 8:05:09.840]  disruption
[8:05:12.800 --> 8:05:20.880]  in my 16 years of deep research it has become clear the number one threat to any sovereign
[8:05:20.880 --> 8:05:26.800]  free nation is its military look at nazi germany look at latin america look at asia look at africa
[8:05:26.800 --> 8:05:34.640]  look at eastern europe when you build up a giant paramilitary police force it almost always tries
[8:05:34.640 --> 8:05:42.240]  to take over the society and the last 12 years we've watched an acceleration of militarization
[8:05:42.240 --> 8:05:47.840]  of police we've watched threat fusion centers the ten fema regions expand the governor's council
[8:05:47.840 --> 8:05:53.840]  i've been to urban warfare drills where our own military is training to lock down and barricade
[8:05:53.840 --> 8:06:02.480]  and blockade us cities and confiscate our firearms this whole program accelerated after 1999 when
[8:06:02.480 --> 8:06:08.640]  congress got rid of the glass steagle act it allowed private central banks to issue unlimited
[8:06:08.640 --> 8:06:16.080]  counterfeit financial instruments known as derivatives and we've heard that oh the military
[8:06:16.080 --> 8:06:23.760]  and the police state the tsa it's for al-qaeda but now we see checkpoints in tennessee run by the army
[8:06:23.760 --> 8:06:29.280]  shutting down highway searching citizens we see them in new york state with x-ray machines we see
[8:06:29.280 --> 8:06:35.200]  it all over the nation we see marines running illegal checkpoints for dui in california
[8:06:35.200 --> 8:06:40.240]  and when the governors and others complain they're told sit down and shut up it's under
[8:06:40.240 --> 8:06:47.200]  homeland security it's under continuity of government and now as the world implodes as
[8:06:47.200 --> 8:06:55.120]  the derivatives dollar devaluation crisis expands we're seeing the police and military being called
[8:06:55.120 --> 8:07:01.360]  out against the general population all over the world as people go under austerity as their pension
[8:07:01.360 --> 8:07:07.520]  funds are cut as their benefits are cut but their taxes go up and here domestically in the u.s this
[8:07:07.520 --> 8:07:14.320]  huge apparatus of oppression is openly being set up and deployed against the people and i saw an
[8:07:14.320 --> 8:07:20.400]  amazing blurb from business insider that linked to an article and the audio of the governor of
[8:07:20.400 --> 8:07:27.200]  wisconsin on the mpr saying hey we're cutting all these state employees and we're gonna make you pay
[8:07:27.200 --> 8:07:33.120]  more your paycheck into a pension fund which they loot out the back door and if you don't like it
[8:07:33.120 --> 8:07:39.920]  we're going to use the national guard on you and on the heels of the governor's speech and just in
[8:07:39.920 --> 8:07:45.200]  case there are problems the governor went on to say that he has called the wisconsin national guard
[8:07:45.200 --> 8:07:52.720]  and other agencies to make sure they would be ready just in case that's what this whole homeland
[8:07:52.720 --> 8:07:58.720]  security systems for you know they distract you over here with men living in caves in central asia
[8:07:58.720 --> 8:08:03.920]  you think you're giving your rights up to protect you from the dangerous ankle biting al qaeda but
[8:08:03.920 --> 8:08:08.960]  then meanwhile the whole system is rolled out against the american people and this is just
[8:08:08.960 --> 8:08:15.520]  another signpost on the road to tyranny on the road to serfdom illustrating how the paramilitary
[8:08:15.520 --> 8:08:24.160]  control grid has been set up and deployed against the american people bottom line al qaeda is a cover
[8:08:24.160 --> 8:08:30.160]  story we've given you the myac report and all the other internal documents that prove this apparatus
[8:08:30.160 --> 8:08:36.960]  is designed for the american people and it's being rolled out nationwide the tsa on the streets of
[8:08:36.960 --> 8:08:42.480]  america it's being rolled out with governor shoot their mouths off saying you got a problem with me
[8:08:43.200 --> 8:08:48.560]  armed force is standing by the globalists know the american people are awakening they know people
[8:08:48.560 --> 8:08:53.520]  are becoming aware of what's happening and if they can sell the military and police on going along
[8:08:53.520 --> 8:09:01.040]  with this brazen attack on our liberty and to be this homeland brigade to suppress us here at home
[8:09:01.040 --> 8:09:06.640]  they're going to get away with it it's only going to get worse from here on out unless we get the
[8:09:06.640 --> 8:09:11.360]  word out and take our states back legally and lawfully through the tenth amendment you have

[8:12:26.880 --> 8:12:32.400]  the things happening in the world right now before i get to all my questions what is front and center
[8:12:32.400 --> 8:12:39.440]  on your radar screen right now well obviously here in japan where it seems to be a bright and
[8:12:39.440 --> 8:12:45.120]  sunshiny day over here but that just belies the fact that 700 kilometers from where i am unfortunately
[8:12:45.120 --> 8:12:50.400]  fukushima is continuing to to act up and to do strange things that that can't be accounted for
[8:12:50.400 --> 8:12:54.320]  yet so i definitely want to get into that but before i do let me just say thank you for having
[8:12:54.320 --> 8:12:59.440]  me on today and say thank you for letting me be a part of this and i'd like to put the call out
[8:12:59.440 --> 8:13:04.160]  for any corbit report supporters out there in the audience i'd like to challenge them to do exactly
[8:13:04.160 --> 8:13:07.760]  what i've just done which is donate to the info wars money bomb because i've said it before and
[8:13:07.760 --> 8:13:12.480]  i'll say it again there would be no corbit report without the alex joneshow without info wars calm
[8:13:12.480 --> 8:13:16.720]  without prison planet dot tv without all of the incredible information that you've been putting
[8:13:16.720 --> 8:13:21.200]  out for for decades now there just wouldn't be a corbit report because the information can come
[8:13:21.200 --> 8:13:26.240]  from any sources but the message the core heart and kernel of info wars which is that people can
[8:13:26.240 --> 8:13:30.000]  get out there and take action into their own hands and to put this information into other
[8:13:30.000 --> 8:13:34.240]  people's hands that was what motivated me to start the corbit report in the first place so
[8:13:34.240 --> 8:13:38.160]  my hats off to you for all your incredible work over the years and i hope that people out there
[8:13:38.160 --> 8:13:43.600]  will support the info wars project well james thank you that that's always been my mission
[8:13:44.160 --> 8:13:50.320]  is to get researchers and thinkers and people like yourself to take action and get involved
[8:13:50.320 --> 8:13:55.520]  that's where we have true safety is in numbers and people like yourself taking action i want to
[8:13:55.520 --> 8:14:00.560]  get into what's happening in greece i ran libya all the things you've been covering the fake
[8:14:00.560 --> 8:14:06.800]  bin laden killing this man of peace this peace prize winner obama and all of his wars before
[8:14:06.800 --> 8:14:11.520]  we get into that let's talk about fukushima you know we go back six eight months ago the explosions
[8:14:11.520 --> 8:14:17.680]  the radiation the epa raising the level of what's safe the whole government of japan having to
[8:14:17.680 --> 8:14:23.600]  basically resign the leaders over a cover up and now we're told fission is continuing in the last
[8:14:23.600 --> 8:14:29.840]  week the the black belching death of radiation is continuing to leak out on the people of japan
[8:14:29.840 --> 8:14:36.560]  then across the pacific wreaking havoc in north america exactly right and and let's go through
[8:14:36.560 --> 8:14:39.920]  the last week because there's been some pretty big things happening especially because they've
[8:14:39.920 --> 8:14:43.680]  been trying to tell us for a while now that everything's under control go back to sleep no
[8:14:43.680 --> 8:14:48.480]  need to look at this or worry about it everything's going into cold shutdown it'll be done even
[8:14:48.480 --> 8:14:52.720]  earlier than expected so there's nothing to worry about anymore and that's the message that's been
[8:14:52.720 --> 8:14:57.520]  going out through tepco and the japanese government in the mainstream media but some very worrying
[8:14:57.520 --> 8:15:01.760]  signs cropped up this week that that's definitely not the case and for people who are interested
[8:15:01.760 --> 8:15:06.080]  in this there are there are really very few sites on the net that are devoted to this issue there are
[8:15:06.080 --> 8:15:10.800]  a few really good ones out there so but i decided to create my own website fukushima update dot com
[8:15:10.800 --> 8:15:15.440]  where i'm going through hundreds of articles every day and trying to put highlight the best ones
[8:15:15.440 --> 8:15:20.000]  on the situations and there there's just so few websites out there that are really doing that so
[8:15:20.000 --> 8:15:24.000]  i hope more people will take that up and start spreading this information but uh but let's go
[8:15:24.000 --> 8:15:31.360]  through this week on wednesday morning at about 2 30 a.m japanese time the tepco had detected some
[8:15:31.360 --> 8:15:37.280]  high levels of xenon 135 which is a byproduct of nuclear fission so they were very concerned about
[8:15:37.280 --> 8:15:44.560]  that they started pumping boric acid into the reactor two the the molten slag heap that is
[8:15:44.560 --> 8:15:49.760]  reactor two at this point and in order to try to contain that reaction that that fission that they
[8:15:49.760 --> 8:15:55.120]  had detected um although they didn't detect it directly they detected it through the xenon 135
[8:15:55.120 --> 8:16:00.400]  they uh they did that in 2 30 in the morning on wednesday and then they came out that day and said
[8:16:00.400 --> 8:16:05.200]  well yes it seems that criticality recriticality has been achieved that is the the molten slag
[8:16:05.200 --> 8:16:10.880]  heap in the bottom of the reactor there has somehow amazingly actually started spontaneous
[8:16:10.880 --> 8:16:15.360]  fission again which shouldn't be able to happen because it requires the fuel to be packed in the
[8:16:15.360 --> 8:16:19.920]  right way with the right uh the right water in the right way and and everything happening should
[8:16:19.920 --> 8:16:24.160]  be it should be the case that it has to be a certain special series of events that have to
[8:16:24.160 --> 8:16:28.640]  take place for for criticality to be achieved well just interrupt you know my dad only took
[8:16:28.640 --> 8:16:33.120]  one semester of physics at ut but they have a nuclear reactor there back in the 60s and
[8:16:33.120 --> 8:16:39.520]  physicists have had on and dr busby and others they say that naturally through electrolysis or
[8:16:39.520 --> 8:16:48.480]  or whatever that these systems kind of percolate into layers and that naturally it can purify
[8:16:48.480 --> 8:16:53.760]  into levels to create this fission and regardless they've now admitted this is now happening
[8:16:54.560 --> 8:16:59.120]  well they they came out and admitted it later on that day but uh but the latest the very latest
[8:16:59.120 --> 8:17:04.800]  from nhk is that tepco retracts criticality call and they're basically saying that uh no
[8:17:04.800 --> 8:17:10.080]  our mistake the xenon 135 doesn't mean that the uh a continuing reaction has occurred it means that
[8:17:10.080 --> 8:17:15.760]  there's been spontaneous nuclear fission of radioactive curium 242 and 244 and it's just
[8:17:15.760 --> 8:17:20.240]  spontaneous fission it's not a big deal it's not an ongoing concern and i think the overwhelming
[8:17:20.240 --> 8:17:25.040]  message of this is once again go back to sleep it's not such a big deal and uh and one of the
[8:17:25.040 --> 8:17:29.040]  interesting things that slipped out when they were admitting that they had detected this this fission
[8:17:29.040 --> 8:17:33.520]  going on in two is that they were also detecting other things going on in one and three and they
[8:17:33.520 --> 8:17:38.000]  weren't ruling out the the idea that one and three were achieving re-criticality as well so
[8:17:38.000 --> 8:17:41.920]  so that's really worrying right now they're saying it's not a sign of criticality but there are some
[8:17:41.920 --> 8:17:46.880]  other worrying indications that are coming out right now um including this one reactor two hydrogen
[8:17:46.880 --> 8:17:52.800]  levels rising despite work to improve reliability of nitrogen injection and then there's another
[8:17:52.800 --> 8:17:58.640]  really important story about uh about xenon uh one uh sorry not xenon 135 that was the one that
[8:17:58.640 --> 8:18:04.960]  originally prompted them to to start investigating this but there's a there was a 100 fold increase
[8:18:04.960 --> 8:18:12.080]  in a krypton 95 if i'm reading that correctly um 100 fold increase on november 2nd which is a
[8:18:12.080 --> 8:18:18.880]  different byproduct and it sorry krypton 85 and it uh it points to again this hasn't been explained
[8:18:18.880 --> 8:18:22.640]  from what i understand from their their latest retraction of the criticality call they're talking
[8:18:22.640 --> 8:18:28.480]  about xenon 135 oh that was the spontaneous fission of this curium but they haven't talked
[8:18:28.480 --> 8:18:33.440]  to yet about the the krypton 85 which you can go and you can look at tepco's reports because
[8:18:33.440 --> 8:18:38.720]  they're releasing all these details very detailed analyses of what they're they're finding and uh
[8:18:38.720 --> 8:18:42.560]  you can you can see that on their reports but they're not talking about the krypton 85 and then
[8:18:42.560 --> 8:18:47.920]  there's another video that came out the other day informable picked up on this just incredible
[8:18:47.920 --> 8:18:53.600]  it looks like there's a new hole in the in the containment for for unit two um it hasn't been
[8:18:53.600 --> 8:18:57.600]  verified yet and i don't see anyone else reporting on it but if you go and look at the video there's
[8:18:57.600 --> 8:19:02.240]  definitely something there that wasn't there the other day so the implication is that there
[8:19:02.240 --> 8:19:05.520]  there might have been another explosion there might have been something i don't know forcing
[8:19:05.520 --> 8:19:10.000]  its way out of there we don't know at this point but uh but informable also managed to capture some
[8:19:10.000 --> 8:19:16.320]  video of the the the crane doing some testing right outside where that hole is so uh so that
[8:19:16.320 --> 8:19:19.760]  raises the possibility that maybe that's where they're doing the testing that they found the xenon
[8:19:19.760 --> 8:19:24.320]  135 and who knows if this is related to something much much bigger going on right there that we
[8:19:24.320 --> 8:19:29.120]  don't know about and that's that's the point because we what we've seen with this whole disaster is
[8:19:29.120 --> 8:19:34.880]  they keep not telling us about critical things until months later oh yeah by the way we detected
[8:19:34.880 --> 8:19:40.240]  meltdown in the first few hours of the disaster i mean just ridiculous things like that well that
[8:19:40.240 --> 8:19:46.160]  was my next point is that if you go back to when all this started we saw mushroom clouds huge explosions
[8:19:47.040 --> 8:19:52.960]  uh reactor cores injected into the sky and months later they said yeah the japanese government
[8:19:52.960 --> 8:19:58.880]  covered it up with bulldozers and didn't even mark where they covered the rods a mile and a half away
[8:19:58.880 --> 8:20:03.120]  and you were on air covering that and i remember your coverage of that in the first few days and
[8:20:03.120 --> 8:20:06.400]  you were you were looking at the explosion and you were noting well that looks like there are
[8:20:06.400 --> 8:20:10.320]  rods going out and all of that that sort of stuff and that did come out later and they just kind of
[8:20:10.320 --> 8:20:14.880]  blithely burried it in some new york all idea was go up and look at the at the at the general
[8:20:14.880 --> 8:20:19.680]  electric designs and then say that but it did turn out that was true but it turns out they
[8:20:19.680 --> 8:20:25.440]  knew it the whole time and lied to people but in japan a lot of the government's gotten in trouble
[8:20:25.440 --> 8:20:31.680]  here is that as a small drifts over you know in the trade winds and the jet stream over to north
[8:20:31.680 --> 8:20:37.600]  america it's just hey it's fine go to sleep yeah well i think there are two interesting things to
[8:20:37.600 --> 8:20:42.880]  take out of the whole fukushima debacle and one of them is the fact that i'm sure your listeners
[8:20:42.880 --> 8:20:48.480]  don't need to be told this but but here it is again uh triple confirmed that anytime there's a threat
[8:20:48.480 --> 8:20:52.960]  to the system itself to the the functioning of the big corporations that are in bed with the big
[8:20:52.960 --> 8:20:57.280]  government or the overarching system whenever there's a threat to that they will rally around
[8:20:57.280 --> 8:21:02.160]  themselves to protect themselves and they don't they don't care at all about the average person
[8:21:02.160 --> 8:21:07.040]  and that came out when the prime minister who was the prime minister during this crisis now to akon
[8:21:07.040 --> 8:21:13.680]  when he left office he did some interviews and he said oh by the way um guess what uh when i was
[8:21:13.680 --> 8:21:17.920]  prime minister in the wake of this crisis and i was asking my advisors what is the worst thing
[8:21:17.920 --> 8:21:22.000]  that can happen like in worst case scenario what should what what should we do what'll happen
[8:21:22.000 --> 8:21:26.560]  and they were saying you're gonna have to evacuate tokyo and he said uh he ruled it out immediately
[8:21:26.560 --> 8:21:31.760]  because that would call into question the the viability of japan as a nation well let me raise
[8:21:31.760 --> 8:21:36.640]  that point i mean let me raise that point because i forget the percentage of folks that live in
[8:21:37.280 --> 8:21:43.200]  in tokyo for overall japan i think it's 30 million in the greater metropolitan area out of what 125
[8:21:43.200 --> 8:21:49.600]  million something like that so you're talking about 25 percent it's in that range yeah yeah so
[8:21:49.600 --> 8:21:54.640]  but but i've seen documentaries now people pointing out that an american tourist that just two years
[8:21:54.640 --> 8:22:00.080]  ago or a year ago you'd go and the subways were jammed the streets were jammed now i've seen videos
[8:22:00.080 --> 8:22:06.080]  where it's like a ghost town in many cases are you seeing that living in japan that that the
[8:22:06.080 --> 8:22:12.560]  japanese have evacuated to the south or the west i'm seeing the exact opposite in a lot of ways i
[8:22:12.560 --> 8:22:17.600]  would expect it to be a lot different but it seems that it's uh it's not that way and i personally
[8:22:17.600 --> 8:22:21.520]  i've i've still never even been to that part of the country i've never even been in that area so
[8:22:21.520 --> 8:22:25.440]  i don't know from firsthand but i've seen for example on zero hedge yesterday they had some
[8:22:25.440 --> 8:22:30.560]  coverage of a guy who went to fukushima and uh basically taking pictures of the town just everyone
[8:22:30.560 --> 8:22:34.960]  you know going about their business and everything just seemed like normal and i think that's
[8:22:34.960 --> 8:22:38.800]  been the way that the japanese have been coping with this to to a certain extent on a certain
[8:22:38.800 --> 8:22:44.240]  surface level uh the old japanese mentality have just uh got up and take it and um and and that's
[8:22:44.240 --> 8:22:48.320]  one of the reactions but there's i think there's an underlying reaction that's going on here that
[8:22:48.320 --> 8:22:53.280]  that that suggests something completely different because nhk is also reporting today 70 percent
[8:22:53.280 --> 8:22:58.160]  in japan want end to nuclear power and that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone because of course
[8:22:58.160 --> 8:23:03.440]  japan the japanese have an aversion to nuclear power and have have had for a long time obviously
[8:23:03.440 --> 8:23:07.840]  given the the history of furochima and all of that but uh but i think what this indicates is
[8:23:07.840 --> 8:23:12.480]  that finally people are starting to speak up about it and you're starting to see movements of people
[8:23:12.480 --> 8:23:17.600]  and organizations and protests of nuclear power that are growing and i think becoming a bigger
[8:23:17.600 --> 8:23:22.560]  force in japan and and that's something that i'm not sure um would have happened if if it wasn't
[8:23:22.560 --> 8:23:27.680]  for something like fukushima so i think there is some sort of countervailing tendency this the the
[8:23:27.680 --> 8:23:31.600]  public is waking up the public are questioning what they're being told and that's a very hopeful
[8:23:31.600 --> 8:23:38.560]  sign for a society like japan but is it enough well it certainly is a hopeful thing because
[8:23:38.560 --> 8:23:42.000]  they're trying to build more of these nuclear power plants and i'm not against technology but
[8:23:42.560 --> 8:23:46.560]  you had in the fifties exactly right well the thing is they can they can construct nuclear
[8:23:46.560 --> 8:23:51.120]  power plants in a safer way but the the reason that we use the uranium the reason it's been
[8:23:51.120 --> 8:23:55.440]  constructed like this is because of the nuclear weapons industry and it's it's really a byproduct
[8:23:55.440 --> 8:24:00.160]  of that is is the reason we have the construction that we have today which is inherently unsafe and
[8:24:00.160 --> 8:24:07.360]  causes is going to cause more disasters like this in the future well you're right about that and and
[8:24:07.360 --> 8:24:11.280]  and so they won't let us have all these clean technologies are cleaner we've got all this
[8:24:11.280 --> 8:24:16.240]  40 year old designs he had semi valley reactor blow up in the fifties they covered that up we've
[8:24:16.240 --> 8:24:22.240]  had all these other reactor disasters and there's just this this establishment belief that they're
[8:24:22.240 --> 8:24:28.160]  just illusion and say it's all fine that makes it okay it's it's not only that i mean if you look
[8:24:28.160 --> 8:24:33.040]  in the way that the the reaction to this played out even in japan let alone in america and canada
[8:24:33.040 --> 8:24:37.520]  and all around the world but in japan of course they in the immediate wake of the the disaster
[8:24:37.520 --> 8:24:44.480]  they raised the the maximum radiation levels for the nuclear power plant workers to 250 millisieverts
[8:24:44.480 --> 8:24:50.800]  from 100 and they've just now just put it back down to 100 so so it just goes to show that these
[8:24:50.800 --> 8:24:56.160]  these figures that they give the public are just as as meaningless as as as as they make it i mean
[8:24:56.160 --> 8:25:00.080]  it's not worth the paper it's not written on basically that they can just adjust these numbers
[8:25:00.080 --> 8:25:04.480]  anytime they like and it is truly just to preserve the functioning of the state and preserve the
[8:25:04.480 --> 8:25:08.240]  functioning of the company and make sure that they can't get sued in the future it has nothing to do
[8:25:08.240 --> 8:25:13.120]  with public safety the exact same thing with the maximum allowable radiation limits in food
[8:25:13.120 --> 8:25:18.720]  which they they bumped up in the wake of the disaster to 500 millisieverts or 500 becrolls
[8:25:18.720 --> 8:25:23.120]  per kilogram which they've just once again brought down to to put it in line with international
[8:25:23.120 --> 8:25:27.520]  standards but again it shows you they just put it up and down whatever they need to in order to
[8:25:27.520 --> 8:25:31.920]  cover their hide behind ends and make sure that they're that they're safe and sound and nothing
[8:25:31.920 --> 8:25:37.920]  will be able to challenge their monopolies of power well we're talking to james corbett of the
[8:25:37.920 --> 8:25:43.600]  corbett report uh james getting into other issues you've covered libya you've covered what's happening
[8:25:43.600 --> 8:25:48.960]  right now in the euro you've covered uh israel openly saying they're getting ready to strike our
[8:25:48.960 --> 8:25:55.280]  an three weeks after we first started reporting on it geopolitically what do you see is the biggest
[8:25:55.280 --> 8:26:01.280]  threat on the horizon i'm really concerned about the way the syria and iran talk is ramping up
[8:26:01.280 --> 8:26:06.400]  again after um after they seem to be distracted with the whole libyan campaign but of course after
[8:26:06.400 --> 8:26:11.120]  they got rid of gdafi it's just what's the next one on the list and it looks like it's going to be
[8:26:11.120 --> 8:26:17.120]  syria if things unfold as the as they're unfolding and and we see that we see so many parallels
[8:26:17.120 --> 8:26:21.280]  between the campaign to demonize syria right now and the campaign that was used to demonize
[8:26:21.280 --> 8:26:26.640]  libya and even the campaign that was used against hussein back in 91 so um for example back in
[8:26:26.640 --> 8:26:32.240]  january of this year the human rights council was uh was holding meetings and and uh considering
[8:26:32.240 --> 8:26:36.640]  whether to give libya a human rights award for all of their great work in educating their
[8:26:36.640 --> 8:26:41.760]  population and having relative freedom and in their society literally in january they were
[8:26:41.760 --> 8:26:46.400]  talking about that and then in february this bunch of ngo's came together to write this
[8:26:46.400 --> 8:26:52.720]  letter protesting what and uh and three days after they wrote that letter to the un the human
[8:26:52.720 --> 8:26:57.920]  rights council convened a special session in which they they condemned uh libya they condemned gdafi
[8:26:57.920 --> 8:27:02.400]  they they wanted him out of the human rights council they wanted uh security council to take
[8:27:02.400 --> 8:27:07.200]  over and of course that started the whole ball rolling that that led to the no fly zone which
[8:27:07.200 --> 8:27:12.480]  turned into a bombing zone a bombing campaign overnight however that happens action i mean
[8:27:12.480 --> 8:27:18.720]  i mean a peace prize winner let it though so it's liberal i mean i'm sure you've seen the liberal
[8:27:18.720 --> 8:27:23.200]  love the little girl their jaw blown off their tongue hanging out screaming in pain i mean
[8:27:23.200 --> 8:27:28.880]  that's trendy james and if you try to put that up on youtube or something then you must be a
[8:27:28.880 --> 8:27:32.800]  terrorist and we have to take that down right away um no unfortunately that's the way this
[8:27:32.800 --> 8:27:36.960]  plays out but but as i'm saying the exact same thing is happening in syria right now and we
[8:27:36.960 --> 8:27:42.240]  have to be aware of this because you have these london-based syrian human rights watchdogs
[8:27:42.240 --> 8:27:47.040]  who are now saying that for example the the the ceasefire that was supposedly reached in recent
[8:27:47.040 --> 8:27:53.760]  days uh demascus and the the the protesters who are really armed an armed insurgency um was broken
[8:27:53.760 --> 8:27:59.760]  by by asad's forces who were firing on people but this of course is again another unattributed
[8:27:59.760 --> 8:28:03.920]  report we don't have any confirmation of this it's all coming from this london-based watchdog
[8:28:03.920 --> 8:28:09.680]  which back in august actually had an incubator baby story about syria there was this report
[8:28:09.680 --> 8:28:14.720]  that went around even cnn picked up picked up on it and was reporting on it that oh they the they
[8:28:14.720 --> 8:28:19.920]  cut off the power in hamah and that thus these incubator babies are going to die for the children
[8:28:19.920 --> 8:28:24.000]  the worst part is they had the picture of these babies and it turned out the picture was actually
[8:28:24.000 --> 8:28:28.800]  taken in egypt it had nothing to do with syria whatsoever but just anything to try to hammer
[8:28:28.800 --> 8:28:33.520]  home to the people that this is the bad man we have to go after it well that's my point is i mean a
[8:28:33.520 --> 8:28:38.480]  lot of these countries are run by corrupt governments but the people running our system are like
[8:28:38.480 --> 8:28:44.720]  scientific manipulating criminals who are putting cancer viruses in the vaccine and
[8:28:44.720 --> 8:28:49.040]  saying don't worry about radiation we'll just raise the level and say it's safe i mean when it
[8:28:49.040 --> 8:28:55.680]  comes to this panopticon of criminals the biggest ones are running our societies that's exactly right
[8:28:55.680 --> 8:29:01.040]  and and that's the point isn't it because uh it's not like i'm for asad or for his government or
[8:29:01.040 --> 8:29:05.440]  i'm defending syria in that regard it's just that i don't want to watch another thing happen
[8:29:05.440 --> 8:29:11.440]  like what happened in libya where these allegations somehow become facts that we have to act on
[8:29:11.440 --> 8:29:17.600]  what about these protesters in syria openly western funded saying please bomb us level
[8:29:17.600 --> 8:29:23.040]  everything i mean this is crazy it's ridiculous and unfortunately unless we can get the word out
[8:29:23.040 --> 8:29:27.600]  about what's really what what might be really happening or or just a put the call out to
[8:29:27.600 --> 8:29:31.520]  to start questioning some of these reports unless we can get that message out there in a big way
[8:29:31.520 --> 8:29:35.680]  it's going to unfold into exactly like it did in libya because this is part of a template it's part
[8:29:35.680 --> 8:29:41.040]  of a strategy demonize demonize anyone who who strikes out at at these armed protesters or whatever
[8:29:41.040 --> 8:29:45.520]  is happening this destabilization that as you say it's now been proven from the from the leaked
[8:29:45.520 --> 8:29:50.240]  documents that the u.s. state department has been funding the syrian opposition no no they fund a
[8:29:50.240 --> 8:29:55.440]  bunch of rebels to blow stuff up the government fights it whether that's wrong or right and they
[8:29:55.440 --> 8:30:00.640]  call them innocent protesters and then they to blows the hell out of the country and i mean it
[8:30:00.640 --> 8:30:06.400]  it's and they call it peace i mean it's incredible and then they read the 200 billion dollar coffers
[8:30:06.400 --> 8:30:12.880]  that goddafi had and no one no one's questioning where that money's going are they amazing what's
[8:30:12.880 --> 8:30:18.400]  your view james corbett what's happening in europe grace this open announcement by the
[8:30:18.400 --> 8:30:24.640]  vatican for world government well that's not unfortunately not too surprising to anyone
[8:30:24.640 --> 8:30:28.480]  who's been watching the vatican in recent years and the calls for a new world order and everything
[8:30:28.480 --> 8:30:32.880]  that we've seen coming out of there but but certainly i think the the whole european situation
[8:30:32.880 --> 8:30:37.440]  just speaks once again to the fact that governments are just there to preserve themselves and and
[8:30:37.440 --> 8:30:42.480]  don't care at all about the populations they're allegedly ruling over and and we see that with
[8:30:42.480 --> 8:30:47.840]  a greek thing this week it came out it was a big deal oh my god it's explosive information
[8:30:47.840 --> 8:30:52.240]  greece is actually going to give their population a chance to vote on this european bailout the
[8:30:52.240 --> 8:30:56.400]  proposal that's going to put them and their children into servitude they're they're actually
[8:30:56.400 --> 8:31:01.360]  going to get a vote on it imagine that what a revolutionary idea and latest that i've heard
[8:31:01.360 --> 8:31:05.280]  it's coming out today that oh no actually they're not going to give them a vote they they managed
[8:31:05.280 --> 8:31:09.360]  to strike a deal to hand transfer power over to the next group of thugs that are going to move
[8:31:09.360 --> 8:31:13.520]  the political football further down the field so they don't have to give the people a vote at all
[8:31:13.520 --> 8:31:18.800]  so so that's good that crisis is averted because the crisis is not that is not the the idea that
[8:31:18.800 --> 8:31:24.320]  people are going to accept this the crisis is the idea that people are going to say no exactly
[8:31:24.320 --> 8:31:28.080]  like they did in iceland and they just can't have that they can't give people a say in what's
[8:31:28.080 --> 8:31:36.240]  happening over their own lives look i could ask a lot of questions here james but on your radar
[8:31:36.240 --> 8:31:41.600]  screen i asked this at the first you brought up the radiation in in uh japan what else are you
[8:31:41.600 --> 8:31:47.040]  really concerned about right now and we see this incredible global push to censor the internet
[8:31:47.040 --> 8:31:51.920]  homeland security admitting they're ordering youtube to censor videos critical of government
[8:31:51.920 --> 8:31:59.600]  what's your view on all that absolutely um that ridiculous and and really disconcerting but again
[8:31:59.600 --> 8:32:03.440]  not really surprising for anyone who's been covering it for a while but uh but one of the
[8:32:03.440 --> 8:32:07.360]  subjects that i've i've been covering lately and i think it's really interesting and hasn't been
[8:32:07.360 --> 8:32:11.840]  getting a lot of attention is the uh the drug running aspects of the the fast and furious
[8:32:11.840 --> 8:32:17.360]  debacle which turns out to as we now start to realize it's a much bigger program it was there
[8:32:17.360 --> 8:32:21.840]  in the bush administration it's been going on for a long time so we know this is a big operation
[8:32:21.840 --> 8:32:25.600]  that's been unfolding for a while and now that it's coming out in court documents that oh yeah
[8:32:25.600 --> 8:32:31.760]  they have to invoke this classified information protection act or whatever it's called in this
[8:32:31.760 --> 8:32:36.480]  the trial of this sinoloa drug cartel gangster because he's claiming hey i was just working for
[8:32:36.480 --> 8:32:40.800]  the u.s government i'm just i'm just part of the gang you know and now that that's coming out they
[8:32:40.800 --> 8:32:45.600]  have to they have to invoke this act so he can't speak in court anymore so so it turns out again
[8:32:45.600 --> 8:32:50.880]  that they're working with the the drug lords in this in this crony monopolist manner to try to
[8:32:50.880 --> 8:32:55.920]  control the drug trade and try to monopolize it and uh and that's all part of this drug uh gun
[8:32:55.920 --> 8:33:01.280]  running program it's just so so mind-boggling corruption off the scale that i think in any
[8:33:01.280 --> 8:33:05.440]  other time i mean we could be talking about this for months and months and months but now there's
[8:33:05.440 --> 8:33:09.760]  just so much going on it's so much on our plates that it's difficult to keep all of these balls
[8:33:09.760 --> 8:33:15.120]  in the air at any one time as you know we've got fritz spring mire coming up but i want to take some
[8:33:15.120 --> 8:33:20.080]  calls with you uh i want to give the number out right now we'll take five or six calls for our
[8:33:20.080 --> 8:33:27.360]  next guest the toll free number to join us we are live at 12 34 central standard time that's 134
[8:33:27.360 --> 8:33:36.800]  eastern or i guess you could say um 11 34 mountain or 10 34 pacific or 234 japanese standard time
[8:33:36.800 --> 8:33:42.640]  that's right the afternoon all right we got donna michigan still holding from earlier
[8:33:42.640 --> 8:33:49.840]  the toll free number to join us is 877789 alex 8777892539
[8:33:49.840 --> 8:33:57.520]  open phones 877789 alex don and michigan you're on the air with the corbett report go ahead
[8:34:01.360 --> 8:34:07.040]  hello don we are speaking to you from austin texas
[8:34:09.440 --> 8:34:13.200]  he fell asleep he's been holding a while all right we just opened the i didn't even know the
[8:34:13.200 --> 8:34:18.720]  phones were open yet they told me a caller was still holding so obviously he's probably already
[8:34:18.720 --> 8:34:26.000]  gone to sleep for the evening so the the the phones are open 877789 alex uh james corbett going back
[8:34:26.000 --> 8:34:33.440]  to all this how much corruption can the system handle coming out how much can they handle when
[8:34:33.440 --> 8:34:39.680]  it's just how incredibly criminal they are becomes more and more evident they can handle exactly as
[8:34:39.680 --> 8:34:44.400]  much as we can handle and i think that's the point of it once again this devolves to the people who
[8:34:44.400 --> 8:34:49.200]  have the the real power and control over all of these systems we always tend to look at the
[8:34:49.200 --> 8:34:53.200]  government and what the government officials are doing as if they're they're the real heart of this
[8:34:53.200 --> 8:34:58.480]  but no we are the heart we are the the the the the base on which they build their the foundations
[8:34:58.480 --> 8:35:02.720]  for their all of their structures and structures of control and all of their their control over
[8:35:02.720 --> 8:35:08.480]  society so when we start to say no they crumble and that's i think that's the point of it and we
[8:35:08.480 --> 8:35:13.360]  are getting to that point as you know we are reaching that critical mass to use an unfortunate
[8:35:13.360 --> 8:35:18.720]  analogy that that we are really starting to take over this process but it's always a question are
[8:35:18.720 --> 8:35:24.000]  we doing enough and and have they set up their their structures to capture us once we get out of
[8:35:24.000 --> 8:35:28.880]  the paradigm well enough so so it's really a race against time but ultimately i think we
[8:35:28.880 --> 8:35:33.760]  are winning that race and and you as you say i mean their corruption is going to start eating
[8:35:33.760 --> 8:35:38.000]  itself as it always does and always has throughout history that it gets to the point where the
[8:35:38.000 --> 8:35:42.800]  corruption is so rampant and is in so many corners and has been fostered for so long by so many
[8:35:42.800 --> 8:35:48.720]  different agencies and departments and multinational corporations that have all of these levers of
[8:35:48.720 --> 8:35:53.120]  power that when these people these parasites get into all of these positions of power they start
[8:35:53.120 --> 8:35:57.520]  feeding on each other because there's nothing left so i think that is in one way is something to
[8:35:57.520 --> 8:36:01.200]  look forward to in another way we're we're all going to suffer when this economy starts to go
[8:36:01.200 --> 8:36:05.600]  down but but that's the only way i think to to get through this and to to really start to construct
[8:36:05.600 --> 8:36:11.120]  the type of system that we do want instead of living under the the reins of the rulers of the
[8:36:11.120 --> 8:36:17.040]  moment all right folks we are queuing up your calls right now i just opened the phone system

[8:37:04.240 --> 8:37:12.560]  here it is 12 38 and 27 seconds we're talking to james corbett of corbett report.com uh james
[8:37:14.000 --> 8:37:19.520]  looking at i already mentioned there are welly and stuff but i mean my gosh it's becoming so
[8:37:19.520 --> 8:37:24.000]  crazy with street lights listening to you and watching you and government with warrantless
[8:37:24.000 --> 8:37:29.280]  checkpoints and tsa everywhere i mean at a certain point this is really becoming lawland
[8:37:29.280 --> 8:37:34.640]  it's i mean you couldn't make this up if you were trying and and trust me people in the past have
[8:37:34.640 --> 8:37:38.880]  tried their best to to make up the most outrageous stuff and it's still nowhere close to what we're
[8:37:38.880 --> 8:37:44.240]  living through right now um usa today coming out today hotel guests recruited with homeland security
[8:37:44.240 --> 8:37:50.080]  tv spots these these psas inviting everyone to be to pretend they're james bond and looking for the
[8:37:50.080 --> 8:37:55.440]  the al qaeda boogie man under every uh under every bed in every corner of the room um just getting
[8:37:55.440 --> 8:38:00.880]  more and more ridiculous and out in your face uh in the open and and as as we've talked about before
[8:38:00.880 --> 8:38:05.600]  i mean this is part of the psychological operation to get people to commit to one side or the other
[8:38:05.600 --> 8:38:09.040]  and they know there's going to be a lot of people that get woken up by this kind of in your face
[8:38:09.040 --> 8:38:12.400]  or willy and tyranny but there's going to be a lot of people who are going to buy into it because
[8:38:12.400 --> 8:38:16.400]  they are so invested in the system and in all of the the things that are going on in their life
[8:38:16.400 --> 8:38:21.440]  they just don't want to face it and they will buy into all of this and that is part of the strategy
[8:38:21.440 --> 8:38:27.360]  and uh and unfortunately they've set up the the the whole orwellian system to to try to control
[8:38:27.360 --> 8:38:32.800]  those people and to oppress those people into prison those people who rise up against them so
[8:38:32.800 --> 8:38:37.840]  so it's uh it's a very difficult situation to combat unless we start to to unlock more minds
[8:38:37.840 --> 8:38:42.800]  which is the whole the whole point of inforce is what what it's all about and i think what it has
[8:38:42.800 --> 8:38:47.840]  to be about at this point let's try james those that have already bought into corruption will just
[8:38:47.840 --> 8:38:52.800]  give into anything once you've said i'm gonna acquiesce to this the sky's the limit i want to
[8:38:52.800 --> 8:39:00.960]  go to phone calls here melvin in new york then harmander alex will joe and dug and others uh
[8:39:01.600 --> 8:39:07.680]  melvin you're on the air thanks for holding alex how you doing man um i'm enjoying the show i
[8:39:07.680 --> 8:39:12.320]  sent you three federal reserve notes that are probably worth a couple pennies you could trade in
[8:39:12.320 --> 8:39:18.640]  thank you and uh thank you and james you're the man i like your channel and here you have a great
[8:39:18.640 --> 8:39:24.800]  voice thank you that's awesome here yeah man i wanted to let you know uh i my school out here
[8:39:24.800 --> 8:39:31.680]  in new york i took an urban study course about the history of new york and the teacher was really
[8:39:31.680 --> 8:39:36.480]  slanted towards the left and all the kids were group thinking with the whole brainwash of the
[8:39:36.480 --> 8:39:43.280]  liberalism but um i the whole class was about capitalism and how capitalism started with
[8:39:43.280 --> 8:39:50.080]  slavery and that the beginning of the country and the whole system that we live under and
[8:39:50.080 --> 8:39:54.800]  understand what the whole 1913 the federal reserve but they were teaching literally that
[8:39:55.440 --> 8:40:01.040]  capitalism come from slavery and that peter styverson and all these collectives had to come
[8:40:01.040 --> 8:40:08.240]  through and the state is the state has had to come uh like fix everything put in curfews you know
[8:40:08.240 --> 8:40:14.000]  social engineering and put like they needed the hand of tyranny to control the wild ravenous people
[8:40:14.000 --> 8:40:21.040]  of new york the the uncontrollable it it was along along that angle and i mentioned the
[8:40:21.040 --> 8:40:26.960]  illuminati i mentioned all kinds of stuff in the class and the teacher didn't refute anything i said
[8:40:26.960 --> 8:40:31.440]  but the kids looked at me like i was an alien well look all you gotta know is the big bankers
[8:40:31.440 --> 8:40:38.400]  always fund communism capitalism we're under a capitalist system slavery is as old as humanity
[8:40:38.400 --> 8:40:44.240]  every group's engaged in that under tyranny and they always push collectivism because they want to
[8:40:44.800 --> 8:40:50.720]  get people dependent so you're not independent but uh james your view on that well i think you're
[8:40:50.720 --> 8:40:55.120]  right here's what i have to say about slavery slavery is all about how you define it so yes
[8:40:55.120 --> 8:40:59.840]  absolutely there was slavery going on in america hundreds of years ago but uh but there's still
[8:40:59.840 --> 8:41:04.320]  slavery going on today it's just a different type and that's dead slavery or they catch you using
[8:41:04.320 --> 8:41:09.840]  their drugs they brought in and so now legally they make you a slave in a prison for 20 cents an hour
[8:41:10.400 --> 8:41:15.360]  that's it i mean they just don't call it slavery so so we don't have to talk about it i guess or if
[8:41:15.360 --> 8:41:19.840]  if if they put in their collectivist system that they want to put in and and make everyone share
[8:41:19.840 --> 8:41:24.000]  their wealth at the point of a gun then that's not slavery that's for that's happiness or whatever
[8:41:24.000 --> 8:41:29.200]  the way they make all discrimination about race or something instead of globalist banks getting
[8:41:29.200 --> 8:41:36.160]  bailout money and being exempt from their own laws melvin final comment hey man my sister works for
[8:41:36.160 --> 8:41:42.640]  the tsa i try to tell her about the body scanners uh she tells me it's lies i tell her you know it's
[8:41:42.640 --> 8:41:48.560]  in the instruction manual you can see the private parts to uh to lock it in to lock the view in she's
[8:41:48.560 --> 8:41:53.280]  like how'd you find that out how do they tell you then she gives me the excuse well look even
[8:41:53.280 --> 8:41:57.360]  sometimes the government messes up and look how they put the underwear bomber the shoe bomber
[8:41:57.360 --> 8:42:03.280]  whichever one of those it was on the plane by mistake of our cia did it so even we mess up
[8:42:03.280 --> 8:42:09.200]  yeah they spin it the government put him on the plane by accident oh yeah you have to submit and
[8:42:09.200 --> 8:42:14.240]  then she gives me the other excuses hopefully if you can't deal with this then you can't be a passenger
[8:42:14.240 --> 8:42:18.480]  in israel because over there they're real security well you notice america's got to be like israel we
[8:42:18.480 --> 8:42:22.560]  always hear that we've got to have checkpoints everywhere because we're now incredible melvin
[8:42:22.560 --> 8:42:28.480]  good to hear from you your sister will wake up later she'll she'll have to wake up thank you uh
[8:42:28.480 --> 8:42:36.560]  harvander in hong kong you're on the air with james corbett go ahead hi alex it's a great to talk to
[8:42:36.560 --> 8:42:41.760]  you and to you through james um it's actually finally nice to talk to you because your show starts
[8:42:41.760 --> 8:42:48.720]  at 12am here and i got to go to sleep to uh go to work the next morning well thank you sir i just
[8:42:48.720 --> 8:42:54.560]  want to say that alex you woke me up about a year ago from your last money bomb that's that's the
[8:42:54.560 --> 8:43:00.800]  first time i actually listened to you and in that year i've learned more about history economics
[8:43:00.800 --> 8:43:07.520]  common law and all of that from you uh more than i did from university well thank you sir we're
[8:43:07.520 --> 8:43:15.280]  just researching the real history thank you exactly um i just want americans to know that um
[8:43:15.280 --> 8:43:25.520]  you know it it's not futile to to fight for what you believe in it's not futile to um get together
[8:43:25.520 --> 8:43:33.520]  and say no we will not stand for this example is here in hong kong um in 2003 they try to pass
[8:43:34.080 --> 8:43:40.080]  what's known as article 23 it's a national security law into our constitution the the basic law here
[8:43:40.080 --> 8:43:46.480]  and half a million people came out to protest against it and they and they shelved it of course
[8:43:46.480 --> 8:43:52.160]  they'll probably bring it out later on but in 2003 they completely shelved it through people power
[8:43:52.160 --> 8:43:58.880]  so nothing is impossible well that's the law of the universe we have the power we're taught we
[8:43:58.880 --> 8:44:04.400]  don't have power and i got a hand at the folks in hong kong and taiwan in places those folks know
[8:44:04.400 --> 8:44:12.080]  how to stand up and say no and we discover that same thing absolutely absolutely uh just just in
[8:44:12.080 --> 8:44:19.040]  july they tried to take away our right uh to vote in by-elections because some legislators here uh
[8:44:19.040 --> 8:44:24.800]  quit uh because they they weren't feeling that democracy in hong kong was maturing fast and so
[8:44:24.800 --> 8:44:30.320]  they quit and ran again in a special by-election that was supposed to be kind of a referendum on
[8:44:30.320 --> 8:44:36.000]  democracy but through that through the dis info they said look they're wasting taxpayers money we've
[8:44:36.000 --> 8:44:42.160]  got to plug this loophole and try to take away our by-election uh right uh voting rights completely
[8:44:42.160 --> 8:44:48.080]  yeah the system always it's causing problems that people can vote it's causing problems that
[8:44:48.080 --> 8:44:54.000]  governments are in gridlock gridlock is good you don't want a greece skid you get a hitler
[8:44:54.000 --> 8:45:00.720]  you get a napoleon you want that uh you want to have things go through a process not be
[8:45:00.720 --> 8:45:06.560]  not be instantaneous uh james got a comment well i i echo that completely and i just invite people
[8:45:06.560 --> 8:45:11.280]  to look at some of the coverage of this uh this greek uh vote idea that came up in the last few
[8:45:11.280 --> 8:45:15.600]  days and you'll see that that people are i mean it's being referred to as an explosive idea to
[8:45:15.600 --> 8:45:20.080]  give the people our media greece doesn't know this money they're about to be signed on as debt

[8:46:03.760 --> 8:46:08.080]  federal reserve building but we got there a little bit late i guess you had already been down there
[8:46:08.080 --> 8:46:14.800]  in the rain that day yeah that was great thank you my friend uh no problem um it's an honor to talk to
[8:46:14.800 --> 8:46:20.480]  you i actually um talk to you a few money bombs ago uh it was actually a few years ago and i don't
[8:46:20.480 --> 8:46:24.480]  know if you actually remember i pressed you a little bit but i had just woken up at that time
[8:46:24.480 --> 8:46:30.480]  we had talked about zeitgeist you remember that i've had a lot of calls about zeitgeist and the
[8:46:30.480 --> 8:46:35.680]  big plastic cities we're gonna live in under a loving computer that runs for a life and i'm
[8:46:35.680 --> 8:46:41.040]  i'm just not enlightened enough to not want to live in the plastic city i know i apologize i
[8:46:41.040 --> 8:46:44.960]  actually pressed you a little hard that and i love it i listen if you want to live in a plastic
[8:46:44.960 --> 8:46:49.680]  city with a robot controlling you'd be my guest but i should have the right to not live in the
[8:46:49.680 --> 8:46:54.880]  reeducation camp definitely and since then i've watched a lot of your videos and you've actually
[8:46:54.880 --> 8:47:00.720]  woken me up and i really appreciate what you do and i'm actually a veteran myself and uh you know
[8:47:00.720 --> 8:47:06.560]  actually being in the military i saw all the compartmentalization and just really how you
[8:47:06.560 --> 8:47:11.920]  talk about that you really don't see what other departments are doing you don't really know
[8:47:11.920 --> 8:47:17.120]  you know what the higher ups are doing you're just doing what you're told and that's it so it's um
[8:47:17.120 --> 8:47:23.440]  basically i've tried to do my best to pass your videos on and wake people up um my brother has
[8:47:23.440 --> 8:47:29.680]  actually just become a kentucky state trooper so i've actually passed on a lot of your videos to
[8:47:29.680 --> 8:47:35.040]  him and he's actually woken up as well so it's actually good that we're getting more law enforcement
[8:47:35.040 --> 8:47:41.520]  every person you wake up is is is one step closer to victory and and like you're not even waking
[8:47:41.520 --> 8:47:46.320]  him up to our info just get him to look at history get him to look at the facts and they'll see the
[8:47:46.320 --> 8:47:52.480]  reality and he fought me on it he was you know special forces he went to afghanistan he you
[8:47:52.480 --> 8:47:57.120]  know actually had to kill people over there and it was a really hard you know thing to actually
[8:47:57.120 --> 8:48:02.400]  wake him up but the information that you put out and i've actually been sending some of james's
[8:48:02.400 --> 8:48:08.800]  videos as well he's actually woke up to you know the truth of what's going on in the world so
[8:48:08.800 --> 8:48:13.600]  thank you for that as well but now he's in a position to actually do something about it and
[8:48:13.600 --> 8:48:20.560]  bring information forward so i think that's great well thank you so much alex that's really an
[8:48:20.560 --> 8:48:26.800]  exciting call uh james what's your take on what alex just said well absolutely let me thank alex
[8:48:26.800 --> 8:48:31.440]  as well because if it isn't for people like him not only confronting their own paradigm and breaking
[8:48:31.440 --> 8:48:35.200]  out of it and and learning the true history but then passing that along to others if people don't
[8:48:35.200 --> 8:48:39.520]  do that then then we are lost so without people like alex out there handing this information out
[8:48:39.520 --> 8:48:43.840]  and getting people to look at it uh we're not going to win so so absolutely my hat's off to
[8:48:43.840 --> 8:48:47.520]  everyone out there who's doing that in whatever form you can you don't have to have a website
[8:48:47.520 --> 8:48:51.520]  or a radio show or whatever just in whatever way you can get this information out that's the way
[8:48:51.520 --> 8:48:58.080]  we're gonna we're gonna win in the end you're right alex god bless you anything else yeah i
[8:48:58.080 --> 8:49:02.800]  constantly put those videos up on my facebook to wake people up constantly and get in those
[8:49:02.800 --> 8:49:08.800]  arguments and really alex you and ron paul are my heroes so thank you once again well thank you
[8:49:08.800 --> 8:49:14.400]  look i'm just an average person who study history and knows the facts and my main mission is to get
[8:49:14.400 --> 8:49:19.840]  other people involved like james corbett and countless others and that's why we're gonna win
[8:49:19.840 --> 8:49:25.360]  truth is truth that's the end of it look at all these lines i've got like 12 more people on hold
[8:49:25.360 --> 8:49:29.600]  we've got 10 minutes left with a james corbett then we're gonna go to break let's give them all 10
[8:49:29.600 --> 8:49:35.280]  seconds that's exactly exactly well i try to shut up that's the good one good thing about a burnout

[8:50:55.600 --> 8:50:59.520]  caught uh one of the most tweeted articles the other day uh about the tolls of world and the
[8:50:59.520 --> 8:51:06.880]  ox pie toll said but uh a bunch of people down here got pepper sprayed um because they wouldn't
[8:51:06.880 --> 8:51:11.920]  step on the sidewalk after curfew um you have to pay a hundred dollars a day to protest here in
[8:51:11.920 --> 8:51:17.760]  tolls at the spot where they've uh decided to protest uh and uh also if you uh have a group
[8:51:17.760 --> 8:51:23.200]  of people you have to have a million dollar insurance liability is also required um and obviously
[8:51:23.200 --> 8:51:29.280]  that's ridiculous uh simply exercising rights free speech and assembly well i mean the government
[8:51:29.280 --> 8:51:34.320]  acts like if you want free speech or be involved like you're some eight-headed monster spewing
[8:51:34.320 --> 8:51:39.840]  venom out of your mouth which just shows how criminal and out of control and sickening
[8:51:39.840 --> 8:51:45.440]  this government's gotten thank you will your take on that corbett i just concur with you
[8:51:45.440 --> 8:51:49.440]  exactly it's the uh they look at you like the eight-headed monster they look at you like uh
[8:51:49.440 --> 8:51:54.720]  they live when they discover this we this one can see we've got one this person wants to demonstrate
[8:51:54.720 --> 8:51:59.120]  they want to speak to their government they're they're informed they want to end the private
[8:51:59.120 --> 8:52:05.520]  fellow bizarre this is terrible oh god almighty if he was only like a peace president murdering
[8:52:05.520 --> 8:52:11.040]  people then it would be okay i yes if you're not a peace prize laureate and all for kinetic
[8:52:11.040 --> 8:52:15.280]  peace actions so all around the world then you must be there's something wrong with you if you're
[8:52:15.280 --> 8:52:20.720]  not blasting children's skin off their faces lovingly you're with al-qaeda if you're not giving

[8:52:50.640 --> 8:52:54.880]  the folks out there getting all the work done fighting the globalist or not listen man we
[8:52:54.880 --> 8:53:00.000]  we are out here i'm out here waking people up we are we are literally in the fight info warriors
[8:53:00.000 --> 8:53:05.440]  for you anybody i mean i i i know it's i know it's not that you we we check all the information
[8:53:05.440 --> 8:53:09.600]  it's all there for everybody to research i mean it you know i think it's hysterical that the
[8:53:09.600 --> 8:53:14.160]  statistic came out with the 47 percent of guns i mean i just got my gun permit where you know
[8:53:14.160 --> 8:53:18.000]  we're we're we're we're we're second amendment we're getting it out there but by the way by
[8:53:18.000 --> 8:53:22.320]  the way dug you shouldn't obviously new jersey you should have to get a permit i've had Texans
[8:53:22.320 --> 8:53:29.360]  tell me i'd like to have a gun but i have to get a permit most states you don't have to i was in
[8:53:29.360 --> 8:53:34.880]  vegas i went to a shooting range where they shoot machine guns or whatever in los vegas is real
[8:53:34.880 --> 8:53:39.760]  popular and people were coming out going i'm a fan of your show and someday i'll be able to have a
[8:53:39.760 --> 8:53:44.720]  permit to own a gun there's no laws in nevada unless you're a felon but obviously new jersey i
[8:53:44.720 --> 8:53:50.000]  think it's got a pretty much of a clamp down but you know it's your right but go ahead oh no no
[8:53:50.000 --> 8:53:54.240]  you're totally right i mean i have we have to you know fill out the mental health paperwork and
[8:53:54.240 --> 8:53:58.320]  then you got to get with the uh the fingerprints time and then do the whole background check i mean
[8:53:58.320 --> 8:54:02.720]  i they you know i have i have to get you know recommendations sent to uh you know the way to
[8:54:02.720 --> 8:54:07.200]  get it through faster as you get you know lower former police officers or you know police officers
[8:54:07.200 --> 8:54:11.600]  on duty and this is the way they speed up the process normally takes three months but it is
[8:54:11.600 --> 8:54:17.520]  absolutely ridiculous but um two two questions for you um i could i could ask you a hundred but uh
[8:54:17.520 --> 8:54:23.280]  you're the the the thrive movement movie have you heard about this no i haven't told me more about it

[8:54:28.480 --> 8:54:34.640]  you go to thrive movement dot order dot com whether to um and i think it goes in talks about the
[8:54:34.640 --> 8:54:40.720]  federal reserve you know the bankers um you know then then that we we uh there's this is energy
[8:54:40.720 --> 8:54:45.520]  basically aliens came here kind of a whole babylike kind of thing but uh but i you know but
[8:54:45.520 --> 8:54:49.280]  they said i've been a little more research into it apparently that the guy directing the movie or
[8:54:49.280 --> 8:54:55.280]  came out with it with the funding is all by proctor and gamble so i don't know if that's what's the
[8:54:55.280 --> 8:55:02.000]  name of it again thrive movement dot com or dot or one of the two but it's supposed to be coming
[8:55:02.000 --> 8:55:08.880]  out 11 11 11 so in the next week or two well i'll check into that thank you so much again ladies

[9:31:38.920 --> 9:31:43.920]  Music
[9:31:43.920 --> 9:31:47.920]  Alright
[9:31:47.920 --> 9:31:51.920]  I've got so many questions for you
[9:31:51.920 --> 9:31:55.920]  They're talking about this new war with Iran, all this is happening
[9:31:55.920 --> 9:31:59.920]  I want to get into that with you, but at the very highest ultimate
[9:31:59.920 --> 9:32:03.920]  Paramount level of the Illuminati
[9:32:03.920 --> 9:32:07.920]  Who is in command of it? Is it the Rothschilds, the British Transylvanian Bloodline
[9:32:07.920 --> 9:32:11.920]  Who is at the very top?
[9:32:11.920 --> 9:32:15.920]  What is their goal?
[9:32:15.920 --> 9:32:19.920]  Well, the Illuminati has different areas of control
[9:32:19.920 --> 9:32:23.920]  The Rothschilds are in charge of the finances
[9:32:23.920 --> 9:32:27.920]  But some of the other bloodlines are in charge of the rituals
[9:32:27.920 --> 9:32:31.920]  Like the Collins are very powerful in the rituals
[9:32:31.920 --> 9:32:35.920]  So, the power of the Illuminati
[9:32:35.920 --> 9:32:41.920]  Is split up and diversified
[9:32:41.920 --> 9:32:45.920]  You can see a parallel in nowadays
[9:32:45.920 --> 9:32:49.920]  For instance, let's say you go into court
[9:32:49.920 --> 9:32:53.920]  The judge is taking the recommendation of somebody else
[9:32:53.920 --> 9:32:57.920]  So he's able to say, well, I'm not guilty of this decision
[9:32:57.920 --> 9:33:01.920]  I just follow the recommendation of blah blah
[9:33:01.920 --> 9:33:05.920]  And then the people that made the recommendation
[9:33:05.920 --> 9:33:09.920]  Or child services division or whoever
[9:33:09.920 --> 9:33:13.920]  They're saying, well, we're not responsible, the judge made the decision
[9:33:13.920 --> 9:33:17.920]  It's sort of like another analogy
[9:33:17.920 --> 9:33:21.920]  Is we have a bomber and it drops bombs
[9:33:21.920 --> 9:33:25.920]  But everybody along the way can deny responsibility
[9:33:25.920 --> 9:33:29.920]  The same way with the Illuminati
[9:33:29.920 --> 9:33:33.920]  The power is diversified and the way things are accomplished
[9:33:33.920 --> 9:33:37.920]  Is split up
[9:33:37.920 --> 9:33:39.920]  Let me stop you again, Fritz, you are so profound
[9:33:39.920 --> 9:33:41.920]  Because when I've studied this, that's what they do
[9:33:41.920 --> 9:33:45.920]  Like with the actuaries and the insurance and the derivatives
[9:33:45.920 --> 9:33:49.920]  They always share the responsibility
[9:33:49.920 --> 9:33:53.920]  But limit it to where no one can figure out where the power comes from
[9:33:53.920 --> 9:33:57.920]  So there's no one to blame for what they do
[9:33:57.920 --> 9:34:01.920]  And it's always a tropism, like a plant growing towards the sun
[9:34:01.920 --> 9:34:07.920]  It's a certain system they build where you can never pinpoint the heart of it
[9:34:07.920 --> 9:34:09.920]  I mean, is that what you're getting at?
[9:34:09.920 --> 9:34:11.920]  Exactly
[9:34:11.920 --> 9:34:15.920]  And back this reaction to me being on your program
[9:34:15.920 --> 9:34:19.920]  Follows that whole scenario
[9:34:19.920 --> 9:34:21.920]  It's kind of involved
[9:34:21.920 --> 9:34:25.920]  And it's not something I can discuss
[9:34:25.920 --> 9:34:29.920]  But it's been interesting to see that there was such a quick reaction
[9:34:29.920 --> 9:34:33.920]  Continuing, you were getting into
[9:34:33.920 --> 9:34:37.920]  How they always insurance off the blame
[9:34:37.920 --> 9:34:41.920]  They always shadow who's in charge
[9:34:41.920 --> 9:34:45.920]  To where you can never get to the enemy
[9:34:45.920 --> 9:34:51.920]  Right, and each of the individuals involved in carrying out something
[9:34:51.920 --> 9:34:55.920]  Can pass the buck mentally and say
[9:34:55.920 --> 9:34:57.920]  Well, I'm not responsible for this
[9:34:57.920 --> 9:34:59.920]  I was only doing this
[9:34:59.920 --> 9:35:03.920]  I was only the mechanic that repaired the bomber
[9:35:03.920 --> 9:35:09.920]  I was just following orders when I pushed the bomb bay to release the bombs
[9:35:09.920 --> 9:35:11.920]  I was only the navigator
[9:35:11.920 --> 9:35:15.920]  It was somebody else that pushed the buttons that released the bomb
[9:35:15.920 --> 9:35:25.920]  And so, down the line, even with the Illuminati Kingpins
[9:35:25.920 --> 9:35:28.920]  Even they have a lot of deniability
[9:35:28.920 --> 9:35:35.920]  Because they can say, well, I'm just following what was planned by previous generations
[9:35:35.920 --> 9:35:39.920]  I'm just working with these other families
[9:35:39.920 --> 9:35:43.920]  I'm just honoring the family's commitment
[9:35:43.920 --> 9:35:51.920]  The circle, they refer to their family as the family
[9:35:51.920 --> 9:35:55.920]  Or the circle, don't break the circle
[9:35:55.920 --> 9:36:03.920]  They've got all these little ways of keeping themselves committed to the plan
[9:36:03.920 --> 9:36:07.920]  And that's it, they're following a plan
[9:36:07.920 --> 9:36:09.920]  They're following orders
[9:36:09.920 --> 9:36:11.920]  Even the guys at the top
[9:36:11.920 --> 9:36:23.920]  And I don't want to paint a picture that these guys at the top are just pure evil
[9:36:23.920 --> 9:36:27.920]  Because life's more complicated than that
[9:36:27.920 --> 9:36:33.920]  And you'll see some of these leading Illuminati Kingpins
[9:36:33.920 --> 9:36:36.920]  They're the philanthropists of the world
[9:36:36.920 --> 9:36:39.920]  They're the ones that are doing great deeds
[9:36:39.920 --> 9:36:43.920]  They do greater deeds than I'll ever do
[9:36:43.920 --> 9:36:47.920]  Well, no, the Illuminati talks about this balance
[9:36:47.920 --> 9:36:49.920]  They create war, but they create peace
[9:36:49.920 --> 9:36:53.920]  They're like trying to occupy the universal sphere
[9:36:53.920 --> 9:36:55.920]  Exactly, they're Gnostics
[9:36:55.920 --> 9:37:00.920]  They want their good deeds to be balanced by their bad deeds
[9:37:00.920 --> 9:37:04.920]  And the bad deeds to be balanced by their good deeds is balance
[9:37:04.920 --> 9:37:13.920]  And so you're going to continue to see this dynamic, this Hegelian philosophy
[9:37:13.920 --> 9:37:16.920]  And all of this Gnostic balancing
[9:37:16.920 --> 9:37:18.920]  You're going to continue to see that
[9:37:18.920 --> 9:37:22.920]  We've seen some advancements
[9:37:22.920 --> 9:37:31.920]  And we're going to continue to see some advancements in science and other areas
[9:37:31.920 --> 9:37:34.920]  Medical and communication advancements
[9:37:34.920 --> 9:37:39.920]  I was about to add, I have been through channels threatened over the years by certain groups
[9:37:39.920 --> 9:37:43.920]  But other powerful groups have reached out and said, off record
[9:37:43.920 --> 9:37:47.920]  You're only allowed to operate because you bring balance
[9:37:47.920 --> 9:37:50.920]  So they see it almost like I'm a manifestation of something
[9:37:50.920 --> 9:37:52.920]  You're a manifestation of something
[9:37:52.920 --> 9:37:55.920]  You particularly went after certain groups they put you in prison
[9:37:55.920 --> 9:37:59.920]  But that's how their whole world view basically works
[9:37:59.920 --> 9:38:02.920]  Correct, exactly
[9:38:02.920 --> 9:38:14.920]  And on my 9-11 talk at which you were generous and made available to the public
[9:38:14.920 --> 9:38:18.920]  I talked about the caduceus, it's a symbol of health
[9:38:18.920 --> 9:38:23.920]  But it's representative of that balancing that they try to control
[9:38:23.920 --> 9:38:24.920]  Well, let's start over
[9:38:24.920 --> 9:38:26.920]  I'm going to shut up and give you the floor
[9:38:26.920 --> 9:38:28.920]  Go into 9-11 symbolism, friends
[9:38:28.920 --> 9:38:32.920]  I'm going to shut up and give you 10 minutes unabated, break down 9-11
[9:38:32.920 --> 9:38:36.920]  And the twin towers, the whole twin columns, the whole thing
[9:38:36.920 --> 9:38:40.920]  You've got the floor
[9:38:40.920 --> 9:38:47.920]  It's obvious that the targets that were picked for the 9-11 attack were iconic
[9:38:47.920 --> 9:38:53.920]  They were meant to evoke certain things from people
[9:38:53.920 --> 9:39:02.920]  And just getting right to the point, towers have in the psyche of humans
[9:39:02.920 --> 9:39:05.920]  For thousands of years represented security
[9:39:05.920 --> 9:39:16.920]  And so an attack on the World Trade Center towers was an attack upon the security of the United States
[9:39:16.920 --> 9:39:22.920]  What it did was on a subconscious level is make people feel insecure
[9:39:22.920 --> 9:39:25.920]  That we can't protect ourselves, that we're vulnerable
[9:39:25.920 --> 9:39:29.920]  And 9-11 is the number for security, that's when it happened, please continue
[9:39:29.920 --> 9:39:34.920]  Yes, there you go, that dichotomy again
[9:39:34.920 --> 9:39:40.920]  You know, and you'll see that in the mind control
[9:39:40.920 --> 9:39:48.920]  Like everything false is real, you know, I mean, it's this
[9:39:48.920 --> 9:39:51.920]  I'm interrupting again, seriously, you've got the floor, I'm not interrupting again
[9:39:51.920 --> 9:39:55.920]  Just start over, get into 9-11
[9:39:55.920 --> 9:40:00.920]  You're welcome too
[9:40:00.920 --> 9:40:02.920]  I love your comments
[9:40:02.920 --> 9:40:12.920]  And I can see why over the years you have built up so many fans and so many listeners
[9:40:12.920 --> 9:40:15.920]  And you make it fun for people
[9:40:15.920 --> 9:40:20.920]  And it should be, it should be interesting and fun for people
[9:40:20.920 --> 9:40:24.920]  9-11 has a tremendous amount of symbolism
[9:40:24.920 --> 9:40:28.920]  11 has a tremendous amount of symbolism
[9:40:28.920 --> 9:40:42.920]  11 stands for towers and towers stand, towers come into illuminati symbology in a lot of ways
[9:40:42.920 --> 9:40:50.920]  And they tie back in with, for instance, the hopsperts
[9:40:50.920 --> 9:41:00.920]  One thing I pointed out in the 9-11 talk was that even our dollar sign has the twin towers of the hopsperts in it
[9:41:00.920 --> 9:41:03.920]  People don't realize why are there two lines
[9:41:03.920 --> 9:41:12.920]  It's because those were hopsperts, towers, and those symbols then got onto the Spanish dollar
[9:41:12.920 --> 9:41:16.920]  And then the Americans adopted it from the Spanish
[9:41:16.920 --> 9:41:23.920]  So it has a long history
[9:41:23.920 --> 9:41:33.920]  So they picked their targets very well, then the other target being the Pentagon
[9:41:33.920 --> 9:41:39.920]  Which represents, you know, protecting us too, our military
[9:41:39.920 --> 9:41:48.920]  The United States can't even protect the most sacred, holiest building of the military, the heart
[9:41:48.920 --> 9:41:51.920]  The Pentagon, it was attacked
[9:41:51.920 --> 9:42:02.920]  So it conveys to people that the United States is truly under attack and can't protect itself
[9:42:02.920 --> 9:42:11.920]  And with that, you're able to bring in the Patriot acts and all the rest
[9:42:11.920 --> 9:42:16.920]  Because people are just terrified
[9:42:16.920 --> 9:42:20.920]  You've watched it, you've watched the manipulation
[9:42:20.920 --> 9:42:24.920]  Some more about the symbology
[9:42:24.920 --> 9:42:29.920]  Wow, there's just a lot of, it goes on and on
[9:42:29.920 --> 9:42:33.920]  One of the significant things is 11-11
[9:42:33.920 --> 9:42:43.920]  You see the numbers 11-11 in related to the 9-11 terrorist attack
[9:42:43.920 --> 9:42:48.920]  You see 11-11 pop up in many different ways
[9:42:48.920 --> 9:42:55.920]  Well, 11-11 symbolizes a shift to a new era
[9:42:55.920 --> 9:43:04.920]  In the occult, 11-11 is very powerful numbers
[9:43:04.920 --> 9:43:08.920]  And as I just got through saying
[9:43:08.920 --> 9:43:17.920]  Representing a door or a portal into a new period or a new era
[9:43:17.920 --> 9:43:22.920]  Fred, stop right there because I've heard you like pausing waiting for me to cut in
[9:43:22.920 --> 9:43:28.920]  I'm listening to you, get into 11-11, new portal, new gate, new time, new beginning
[9:43:28.920 --> 9:43:30.920]  And a kind of 2012 type stuff
[9:43:30.920 --> 9:43:34.920]  But also, and I want you to speak to this after you're done talking, finish, take your time here
[9:43:34.920 --> 9:43:41.920]  But after you get into that, why do they have Fox TV or the government hijacks a jet-bar remote control
[9:43:41.920 --> 9:43:45.920]  Fly in the World Trade Center six months before the launch and attack on Afghanistan
[9:43:45.920 --> 9:43:49.920]  Why all these different TV shows and ads about 9-11?
[9:43:49.920 --> 9:43:54.920]  Why do they show you what they're going to do before they do it?
[9:43:54.920 --> 9:43:55.920]  Is that the lesser magic?
[9:43:55.920 --> 9:43:59.920]  So finish up with all the iconography and the archetypes and then continue
[9:43:59.920 --> 9:44:02.920]  So you've got the floor, just keep rolling
[9:44:02.920 --> 9:44:07.920]  Good question or good focus there
[9:44:07.920 --> 9:44:11.920]  The revelation of the method
[9:44:11.920 --> 9:44:17.920]  If you can tell your slave ahead of time what you're going to do
[9:44:17.920 --> 9:44:20.920]  How much more power do you have over him?
[9:44:20.920 --> 9:44:27.920]  Okay, now I'm going to hit you and I'm going to slap you in the face and you're going to stand there and take it
[9:44:27.920 --> 9:44:35.920]  That's one reason why there's the revelation of the method is it freezes people
[9:44:35.920 --> 9:44:43.920]  It literally terrifies some people to realize, whoa, they told us what they were going to do and then they did it
[9:44:43.920 --> 9:44:49.920]  I've seen people frozen in their tracks with that realization
[9:44:49.920 --> 9:44:54.920]  Another thing is, is it's their inside jolly chuckles
[9:44:54.920 --> 9:44:57.920]  I've watched this over the years
[9:44:57.920 --> 9:45:04.920]  They tell their own people, okay, look at such and such and such
[9:45:04.920 --> 9:45:08.920]  And you'll see we're in control
[9:45:08.920 --> 9:45:13.920]  For instance, a real easy way to make that point is
[9:45:13.920 --> 9:45:19.920]  Look on the back of the dollar bill, there's the pyramid and they're all seeing eye
[9:45:19.920 --> 9:45:22.920]  What does a pyramid have to do with America?
[9:45:22.920 --> 9:45:25.920]  What does this all seeing eye have to do with America?
[9:45:25.920 --> 9:45:30.920]  Nothing, a pyramid might have something to do with Egypt
[9:45:30.920 --> 9:45:35.920]  But they can sit there and tell their people
[9:45:35.920 --> 9:45:40.920]  You see, we have the power to put our logos on the money
[9:45:40.920 --> 9:45:45.920]  We have the power to do this, we have the power to do that
[9:45:45.920 --> 9:45:54.920]  And even their own slaves, their own people which they enslave are terrified
[9:45:54.920 --> 9:46:00.920]  Because, wow, look, they're able to show us right on television what they're going to do
[9:46:00.920 --> 9:46:06.920]  There was all kinds of television shows, cartoons
[9:46:06.920 --> 9:46:12.920]  Where they showed the Twin Towers being attacked, comic books
[9:46:12.920 --> 9:46:18.920]  So, you know, they revealed what they were going to do
[9:46:18.920 --> 9:46:22.920]  As I'm sure you and a lot of your listeners are aware
[9:46:22.920 --> 9:46:29.920]  If you take the one and the five and the ten and the twenty and the fifty and the hundred dollar bill
[9:46:29.920 --> 9:46:33.920]  And you fold them all exactly the same way
[9:46:33.920 --> 9:46:38.920]  And you put them in sequence, denominational sequence
[9:46:38.920 --> 9:46:40.920]  And you flip them, it makes a flip chart
[9:46:40.920 --> 9:46:49.920]  It shows the Twin Towers, they come up and then the plane's flying into them and they're falling down
[9:46:49.920 --> 9:46:52.920]  It's a little motion picture
[9:46:52.920 --> 9:47:05.920]  They do this stuff and they can show it to someone and their own people or other people
[9:47:05.920 --> 9:47:10.920]  And it's a revelation of their power
[9:47:10.920 --> 9:47:15.920]  They're not having to surprise us on this
[9:47:15.920 --> 9:47:21.920]  They can, okay, I'm going to punch you in the belly and here it comes
[9:47:35.920 --> 9:47:38.920]  Is there something suspicious about it?
[9:47:38.920 --> 9:47:47.920]  Well, I think the most auspicious thing was what I just mentioned
[9:47:47.920 --> 9:47:52.920]  Hey, Fred, the only way to interrupt you, the only way I can shut up, I want to be honest with you
[9:47:52.920 --> 9:47:55.920]  Is I am actually going in the control room to let you talk
[9:47:55.920 --> 9:47:58.920]  Because I'm so obnoxious, I will interrupt
[9:47:58.920 --> 9:48:01.920]  So I'm actually trying to give you the floor, brother, go ahead
[9:48:01.920 --> 9:48:05.920]  I love your comments
[9:48:05.920 --> 9:48:10.920]  This is a conversation here, it's not a monologue
[9:48:10.920 --> 9:48:16.920]  And I have to be careful because sometimes I can get too detail-oriented
[9:48:16.920 --> 9:48:19.920]  I want to be specific, you've been out of prison almost a year
[9:48:19.920 --> 9:48:22.920]  You decided to come public here, you're obviously getting a lot of heat on you
[9:48:22.920 --> 9:48:25.920]  There were some things you didn't want to get into, you've been told not to get into
[9:48:25.920 --> 9:48:29.920]  Ricky Ross, the biggest cocaine dealer for the CIA on the West Coast
[9:48:29.920 --> 9:48:33.920]  He came on this show and they, you know, in other shows and they're trying to put him back in prison
[9:48:33.920 --> 9:48:38.920]  I warned you up front, we appreciate your courage, but obviously this is stuff they don't want people to be hearing
[9:48:38.920 --> 9:48:45.920]  Well, I think I'll be relatively okay
[9:48:45.920 --> 9:48:58.920]  We'll see, I mean, you know, I'm a believer and I also believe that God's in control to put Lee in
[9:48:58.920 --> 9:49:05.920]  And if he allows certain things, I know that because I love him that all things are going to work together for good
[9:49:05.920 --> 9:49:11.920]  To those that love him and are called according to his purpose, you know the quote
[9:49:11.920 --> 9:49:17.920]  And so we have to go forward with faith
[9:49:17.920 --> 9:49:31.920]  And we can't just sit back and cower in fear, which is what some of these things are done, they're intentionally done in a certain way to do that
[9:49:31.920 --> 9:49:37.920]  One of the things, you look back at the Kennedy assassination
[9:49:37.920 --> 9:49:43.920]  Now, they wanted to get rid of JFK for a whole number of reasons
[9:49:43.920 --> 9:49:48.920]  But there could have been a real simple way to do it
[9:49:48.920 --> 9:49:53.920]  They could have poisoned him, they could have whatever, he had health problems, he was in World War II injured
[9:49:53.920 --> 9:49:57.920]  But instead, they wanted to kill him in public
[9:49:57.920 --> 9:50:01.920]  I want you to speak to JFK and that ritual killing, I know where you're going with this
[9:50:01.920 --> 9:50:04.920]  And then I want you to speak to, you brought this up without me raising it
[9:50:04.920 --> 9:50:09.920]  Why does the Illuminati hate black people so much, why is there, because they like to kill everybody
[9:50:09.920 --> 9:50:13.920]  Let's be clear about that, you know, some black folks think all white people are partly Illuminati
[9:50:13.920 --> 9:50:20.920]  You know, average white folks are dumber in a box of bricks or something, you know, dumber in a hammer
[9:50:20.920 --> 9:50:27.920]  But why is there a particular hatred of black people? I want you to get to that after JFK
[9:50:27.920 --> 9:50:35.920]  They intentionally killed JFK in a public scenario to traumatize the American people
[9:50:35.920 --> 9:50:41.920]  And also just to blatantly show certain people the power that they had
[9:50:41.920 --> 9:50:47.920]  It was definitely a ritual murder, there were a lot of ritual symbology around it
[9:50:47.920 --> 9:50:53.920]  By the way, 9-11 was meant to intimidate governments and populations that were aware and informed
[9:50:53.920 --> 9:50:57.920]  That was another, I mean, I want you to speak to that if you disagree or agree
[9:50:57.920 --> 9:51:04.920]  That was done as well to like, hey, we did this, watch out, we're crazy, we did this in full view
[9:51:04.920 --> 9:51:13.920]  Exactly, that's why Revelation of the Knowledge, Revelation of the Method is one key ingredient
[9:51:13.920 --> 9:51:21.920]  Because you can then quietly tell these other governments, look, you're going to come in line
[9:51:21.920 --> 9:51:28.920]  Okay, so I'm going to stop now, 10 minutes, you've got the floor, go into JFK, go into why they hate black people so much
[9:51:28.920 --> 9:51:33.920]  Go into Revelation of the Method, you've got the floor, so don't stop, you've got it right now
[9:51:33.920 --> 9:51:44.920]  Okay, well, let's go back to a previous thing that we were discussing that David Eich brought up
[9:51:44.920 --> 9:51:59.920]  And that is, whatever we want to call these non-human entities, I'm not going to get into a metaphysical debate as to whether they're aliens or demons or both
[9:51:59.920 --> 9:52:09.920]  But there is definitely higher intelligences that are non-human that have given the Illuminati an agenda
[9:52:09.920 --> 9:52:21.920]  And it's a non-human agenda, it's not human friendly, it's definitely this wonderful creation of God is slated for destruction
[9:52:21.920 --> 9:52:36.920]  And part of the program of bringing this all about is to population control and war
[9:52:36.920 --> 9:52:45.920]  And part of the process of creating wars is doing events like 9-11
[9:52:45.920 --> 9:52:57.920]  You've got, you know, ostensibly this was done for Jihad, that was the symbology supposedly behind 9-11
[9:52:57.920 --> 9:53:04.920]  As we had these Islamic fundamentalists that hated America
[9:53:04.920 --> 9:53:15.920]  And we had to be real careful with allowing hate into our life because the Illuminati loves to manipulate hate
[9:53:15.920 --> 9:53:21.920]  They love to stir up hate and then sit back and watch everybody kill each other
[9:53:21.920 --> 9:53:40.920]  Now the switching here back to JFK, JFK assassination has been one of the best means for people to wake up
[9:53:40.920 --> 9:53:50.920]  And now I see that 9-11 is also an entryway for people to realize that there's something rotten in Denmark
[9:53:50.920 --> 9:53:56.920]  For public wanting, their open ritual has backfired
[9:53:56.920 --> 9:54:11.920]  Exactly, you know, they've made a public display of power, but that public display of power is also a means for us to point out that they do have this power
[9:54:11.920 --> 9:54:25.920]  Manipulating things. In the Kennedy assassination, and I don't know the current number, whether it's 110 or 119
[9:54:25.920 --> 9:54:33.920]  Eye witnesses were killed in mysterious circumstances
[9:54:33.920 --> 9:54:43.920]  A similar situation happened over in Belgium, I'm kind of shifting channels on you here and going in my own direction
[9:54:43.920 --> 9:54:59.920]  But this is something that a lot of the listeners may not be aware of, and that was, in my 1991 book, I exposed one of the Illuminati's top ritual castles in Europe
[9:54:59.920 --> 9:55:06.920]  And I gave the location. Listen, listen, listen, right now I'm leaving the studio to make sure you're not interrupted
[9:55:06.920 --> 9:55:13.920]  I want you to get into that castle, JFK 9-11, Fred, so lay it out right now, you've got the floor, do it right now
[9:55:13.920 --> 9:55:32.920]  Well, from eye witnesses who had been in rituals in the castle where children were sacrificed, and the blood of these children is drained
[9:55:32.920 --> 9:55:46.920]  And quill pins are filled up, and the blood is used to write an account of what the Illuminati had done that day and bring about the plan
[9:55:46.920 --> 9:55:51.920]  And so I exposed this ritual castle in southern Belgium
[9:55:51.920 --> 9:56:08.920]  And at first, you know, this was in 1991, and a number of years transpired and it was like I had, I had, I had, I had, I was a voice in the wilderness and nobody had heard
[9:56:08.920 --> 9:56:19.920]  But eventually it did get heard, and what happened was, is in Belgium, the Belgium government, what almost was toppled
[9:56:19.920 --> 9:56:28.920]  They had big protests in Brussels a couple of times where there were over a half a million Belgians protesting their government
[9:56:28.920 --> 9:56:40.920]  And the reason why is because there, there was a big scandal that broke loose where people had discovered that there were Satanic Covens in their government, the government of Belgium
[9:56:40.920 --> 9:56:56.920]  And that there was pedophilia going on, and this got connected in, and people then were able to connect what was going on and some of the people back to this castle that I had exposed
[9:56:56.920 --> 9:57:19.920]  And so Interpol, due to public pressure, sent somebody here in the United States to my house to interview me to find out information about the ritual murders that went on in this castle
[9:57:19.920 --> 9:57:35.920]  Well, this was a very strange way that this FBI agent who was representing Interpol, it was very strange the way he approached this murder investigation
[9:57:35.920 --> 9:57:53.920]  I would just throw out to the listener right now, if you were an FBI agent or a policeman and you were investigating a murder, how would you approach doing it? And then compare that with what happened in this case
[9:57:53.920 --> 9:58:11.920]  The day he arrived at my house, and I was at that time living with friends, I was upstairs in my study on the computer working on one of my books on the Illuminati
[9:58:11.920 --> 9:58:35.920]  And something told me, my sixth sense or call it the spirit of God, something told me, you ought to go downstairs right now, and when I went downstairs, Eric, who was the head of the house, my friend, he looked at me and he said, there's an FBI agent in the bathroom
[9:58:35.920 --> 9:58:51.920]  And he's here to ask you questions, but he's been trying to get me to throw you out, and he's been asking me why I'm putting up with you living with us, and he's been trying to convince me to throw you out
[9:58:51.920 --> 9:59:05.920]  So I knew from the start that this was a sham investigation, because the FBI agent that came to investigate these murders is trying to turn my friends against me
[9:59:05.920 --> 9:59:29.920]  So he comes out of the bathroom, and he starts asking me questions about the castle, and I was friendly with him, but I basically what ended up happening was, is I told him that in this investigation he was in over his head
[9:59:29.920 --> 9:59:53.920]  And I was not about to contact my eyewitnesses form, and I didn't trust anything of what he was doing, and at one point then he pretended like he had never seen my books, and he grabbed a couple of my mind control books
[9:59:53.920 --> 10:00:04.920]  And he started flipping through it, and he came to a page and he said, oh, you got a mistake here, what do you make of that, as if he just randomly found that mistake on that page
[10:00:04.920 --> 10:00:14.920]  And I said, yeah, I wrote those books and I edited them myself, and you're right, there are errors in there, and I'm responsible
[10:00:14.920 --> 10:00:43.920]  Very strange way to investigate a murder, so here we had something very similar to the Kennedy assassination, and so in order to keep the lid on this scandal, the Illuminati had to kill something in the neighborhood of 120 eyewitnesses
[10:00:43.920 --> 10:01:01.920]  Over there in Belgium, there's a long list of eyewitnesses, very similar to the JFK assassination, which just mysteriously died
[10:01:01.920 --> 10:01:19.920]  I would encourage anyone who has doubts about the hidden hand that events are manipulated, I would encourage them to start with the JFK assassination
[10:01:19.920 --> 10:01:48.920]  And then once they see how events were manipulated there, then you can progress to 9-11, and these blatant shows of Illuminati power that were meant to traumatize us can also be flipped for good as a way for the novice to introduce himself to the fact that events are being controlled and manipulated
[10:01:48.920 --> 10:02:01.920]  Fritz Springmeyer is our guest, we've kept him up late at night, I have Theodore, Brian, Joe, Randy, Jeff, and Bryce holding from earlier before Fritz even joined us
[10:02:01.920 --> 10:02:09.920]  Aaron Dykes is going to come in for a few hours, then we've got Paul Watson, I'll be back with Gerald Salente and others
[10:02:09.920 --> 10:02:24.920]  If you believe in what we're doing and you want to see more of this information, alternative information brought forward to understand our world, donate to the M4WorstMoneyBomb, M4WorstMoneyBomb.com or 888-25-33139, 888-25-33139
[10:02:24.920 --> 10:02:40.920]  We've got a few more folks who are stumbling around and been up all day to take your donation so we can hire a second string who will become first string because we've got like four people and me doing the nightly news every night, I'm up here till like 10 o'clock every night now
[10:02:40.920 --> 10:02:57.920]  On top of the radio, we want to hire another group so that we can like actually not go completely insane busting our butts here, if you donate to us, M4WorstMoneyBomb.com, I want to thank all of you that have donated, I want to go to phone calls for all the folks that are holding
[10:02:57.920 --> 10:03:15.920]  And then we'll go to break and come back with Aaron Dykes, you can punch out now Fritz Springmeyer or you can stay with us for another 15 minutes and take these calls, it's your decision Fritz what do you want to do?
[10:03:15.920 --> 10:03:18.920]  I'll take the calls, let's roll
[10:03:18.920 --> 10:03:33.920]  These calls will be all over the map and then we'll in there come for like a five hours, I'll go take a nap so I'm not completely punch drunk and then I'll come back and go right through two o'clock tomorrow, 27 hour transmission Aaron Dykes coming up
[10:03:33.920 --> 10:03:43.920]  But Fritz, any other things, because I've been steering the conversation here to some extent, any other points you want to make before we go to calls?
[10:03:43.920 --> 10:03:47.920]  Oh we've covered a lot of good points, let's take the calls
[10:03:47.920 --> 10:04:01.920]  Alright, now folks I just want to add, we are one of the only sellers of Bloodlines and Illuminati, a book that I read 10 years ago and a lot of it I couldn't document doing more research, so much of it has been proven, it really is mind blowing
[10:04:01.920 --> 10:04:13.920]  This book is now sold out everywhere, the reprinting has started now, if you want to order it, it'll take a few weeks to get it to you because it's being printed now M4Worst.com is the place to get it
[10:04:13.920 --> 10:04:18.920]  And as a side issue Fritz, I don't want to get it to the whole thing, go ahead
[10:04:18.920 --> 10:04:27.920]  Illuminati Castle I was talking about, there's three pictures of that Illuminati Castle in the Bloodlines book
[10:04:27.920 --> 10:04:40.920]  I was about to say, I'm somewhat of a novice historian myself and I noticed that you've actually got that in here, in fact I forget what page is that on Fritz?
[10:04:40.920 --> 10:04:56.920]  Well, at the very start, and then when you go to the Rockefeller family, and then there's, I don't know where the third one is, but the castle is
[10:04:56.920 --> 10:05:01.920]  What was going on with Marilyn Monroe in Mind Control, speak to that because you've got that here at the very beginning
[10:05:01.920 --> 10:05:03.920]  Say again?
[10:05:03.920 --> 10:05:05.920]  Marilyn Monroe
[10:05:05.920 --> 10:05:27.920]  She was what's called a presidential model, they, in their need to control everything, they have sexual kittens that as the president travels around, if he needs sex, they supply them with sexual kittens
[10:05:27.920 --> 10:05:41.920]  That's, it makes it easier for the Secret Service and NSA and CIA to control things if they know who the president's having sex with
[10:05:41.920 --> 10:05:46.920]  Exactly, who was Anton Lavey on all of this?
[10:05:46.920 --> 10:06:10.920]  Well, Anton Lavey was, as you know, the head of the Church of Satan, in fact his son contacted me while I was in prison, his son hated his father, his son was appreciative of the information that I had written exposing Satanism
[10:06:10.920 --> 10:06:16.920]  So I thought that was interesting, and
[10:06:16.920 --> 10:06:20.920]  Oh really, tell us what your son said to you
[10:06:20.920 --> 10:06:41.920]  I just said he appreciated what I had written and that he hated his father because of the abusive Satanic things that his father had done and that he was in recovery, trying to recover from the abuse that he had suffered
[10:06:41.920 --> 10:06:49.920]  Anton Lavey was a programmer, as you know, he's died, a lot of people thought he was just a big joke, because he had
[10:06:49.920 --> 10:06:53.920]  No, the word is he was CIA and above that
[10:06:53.920 --> 10:07:05.920]  Oh, I'm sure he was connected in several ways, and his sidekick, what was it, Michael Hakino
[10:07:05.920 --> 10:07:20.920]  Yeah, it was, yeah, so for a while they were together in the Church of Satan until Michael Hakino split off
[10:07:20.920 --> 10:07:33.920]  Yeah, we were going somewhere, we were going to have the listeners ask their questions
[10:07:33.920 --> 10:07:43.920]  Yeah, it's just there's so much, Fred, you know, that's the thing, is that you just have incredible research and having you here with us now is just amazing
[10:07:43.920 --> 10:07:48.920]  We'll go to the phone calls, it's just that
[10:07:48.920 --> 10:07:56.920]  The final point I want to make before we go to calls and let you go and then have Aaron Dykes come here and something, go lay down on the couch and get a few hours sleep
[10:07:56.920 --> 10:08:06.920]  Is that people think, oh, you talked about this earlier in the week, they think they're on the winning team joining this, but they destroy their own
[10:08:06.920 --> 10:08:14.920]  I mean, there's no reason when you know the game to join this predatory system, can you speak to that briefly
[10:08:14.920 --> 10:08:35.920]  Yes, I spent quite a few years, approximately 10 years working with people that had been members of the Illuminati over the years, because when I first got started I didn't know anything about the mind control or how to break it
[10:08:35.920 --> 10:08:49.920]  And I was learning through the School of Hard Knocks, trying to help people escape and I can categorically say across the board, it is a nightmare to be a member in the Illuminati
[10:08:49.920 --> 10:09:02.920]  They traumatize and torture their own people and the mind control, you can read about the mind control in some of my books and it's just horrific
[10:09:02.920 --> 10:09:06.920]  It's way beyond your worst imagination
[10:09:06.920 --> 10:09:25.920]  So, like you said last time, you don't want to make a deal with the devil, he pays in counterfeit bills and once he owns your soul, he's just going to torture you
[10:09:25.920 --> 10:09:29.920]  It's not the fun and games that people think it is
[10:09:29.920 --> 10:09:39.920]  What about rock and roll? You know, I've read the biographies of a lot of famous rockers and famous blues people, I mean, it's not like some Christian view the devils involve
[10:09:39.920 --> 10:09:48.920]  These people believe they've sold out to the devil and they talk about it, I mean, there's something going on on this planet
[10:09:48.920 --> 10:10:04.920]  Yes, and then this rock and roll music, they do satanic rituals over all of the stuff that's put out and all of the rock and roll across the board has mind control triggers in it
[10:10:04.920 --> 10:10:07.920]  So it's being used for the Illuminati's mind control
[10:10:07.920 --> 10:10:19.920]  Yeah, the whole thing is exceptionally wicked and you can even track the growth and development of the whole industry and see how the Illuminati created it
[10:10:19.920 --> 10:10:22.920]  Exceptionally wicked
[10:10:22.920 --> 10:10:27.920]  Yeah, going about continually inventing new forms of wickedness
[10:10:27.920 --> 10:10:29.920]  Alright, we'll take these calls, Fritz
[10:10:29.920 --> 10:10:30.920]  Let's do it
[10:10:30.920 --> 10:10:34.920]  Alright, let's talk to Theodore in Arizona
[10:10:34.920 --> 10:10:36.920]  Theodore, you're on the air, go ahead
[10:10:36.920 --> 10:10:37.920]  Hey guys, how's it going?
[10:10:37.920 --> 10:10:39.920]  Good, go ahead
[10:10:39.920 --> 10:10:40.920]  Good, good, good
[10:10:40.920 --> 10:10:47.920]  Could you tell me, Mr. Springmeyer, Mr. Jones, what you guys think of Lucifer?
[10:10:47.920 --> 10:10:50.920]  Fritz, you want to take that?
[10:10:50.920 --> 10:11:10.920]  Well, Lucifer is the Gnostic concept of the light bear, but from the Christian perspective, anything that's in rebellion against God is outside of what's acceptable
[10:11:10.920 --> 10:11:23.920]  And I don't care if Lucifer does bring some form of enlightenment to people, ultimately he's just the nice mask of Satan behind
[10:11:23.920 --> 10:11:25.920]  It's a twisted enlightenment
[10:11:25.920 --> 10:11:28.920]  Yes
[10:11:28.920 --> 10:11:30.920]  Does that answer your question?
[10:11:30.920 --> 10:11:36.920]  Same thing, yeah, same thing about you, Mr. Jones, same thing, you say the same thing
[10:11:36.920 --> 10:11:44.920]  Yeah, the God of this world is Lucifer, and the lower level minions are Satanists, but the high level are Luciferians
[10:11:44.920 --> 10:11:47.920]  What's your view of Lucifer?
[10:11:47.920 --> 10:11:50.920]  I agree with you guys, I just had to ask that
[10:11:50.920 --> 10:11:59.920]  I want to say that I appreciate you, Mr. Jones, Mr. Springmeyer, it's awesome that I caught you guys both at the same time
[10:11:59.920 --> 10:12:08.920]  Anyway, there will be a third party, it will emerge, Mr. Jones, and then there will be leaders that emerge from that
[10:12:08.920 --> 10:12:16.920]  Mr. Paul will kind of catapult all this, you guys are just going to kind of catapult all of this forward, all this work
[10:12:16.920 --> 10:12:20.920]  So it'll be good, it'll be good, we'll fight it
[10:12:20.920 --> 10:12:29.920]  And then the other thing is that I wrote you some letters, you know, I'm not sure if you got those, I hope you did
[10:12:29.920 --> 10:12:34.920]  There's some really good information in it specifically for you, Mr. Jones
[10:12:34.920 --> 10:12:41.920]  And I'll be read it, if you did, keep it close, look at it
[10:12:41.920 --> 10:12:48.920]  Otherwise, I'll see you guys soon, I'm going to be fighting with you guys, I'm always fighting with you guys
[10:12:48.920 --> 10:12:53.920]  I'm right next to you guys, and keep going forward
[10:12:53.920 --> 10:12:58.920]  Thank you Theodore, do you have any comments to what he said, Fress?
[10:12:58.920 --> 10:13:00.920]  No, let's take the next listener
[10:13:00.920 --> 10:13:03.920]  Brian and Houston, go ahead
[10:13:03.920 --> 10:13:12.920]  Alex Jones, very, very good to talk to you, Fritz, thank God that you have been released from prison
[10:13:12.920 --> 10:13:19.920]  I am very, very thankful that you have been released
[10:13:19.920 --> 10:13:25.920]  Alex, thank you so much for the information and the guests that you're having come on this show
[10:13:25.920 --> 10:13:32.920]  Because it's information that all of us need, and you know, I'd like to say one thing to your listeners
[10:13:32.920 --> 10:13:38.920]  You know, the information that Alex is giving you is absolutely without any equivocation true
[10:13:38.920 --> 10:13:43.920]  If you don't believe it, take the time for yourself and research the information yourself
[10:13:43.920 --> 10:13:50.920]  Because I guarantee you, you will find every drop of this information to be unequivocally correct
[10:13:50.920 --> 10:13:57.920]  The two questions that I wanted to bring up, the first one is
[10:13:57.920 --> 10:14:05.920]  Alex, you've been spot on and right on point on several occasions with predictions of your own
[10:14:05.920 --> 10:14:09.920]  Is to the direction that things are going
[10:14:09.920 --> 10:14:17.920]  With the information that's available to us now, can we as troops seeking Americans predict in some way
[10:14:17.920 --> 10:14:22.920]  Knowing what the end game is, how this will play out over the next three to five years
[10:14:22.920 --> 10:14:24.920]  Does anybody have any clue?
[10:14:24.920 --> 10:14:29.920]  Now, we know how it's going to play out and we'll get Fritz's take on this, but it's all up to human activity
[10:14:29.920 --> 10:14:34.920]  It's all up to our will, you know, the system has to twist us to go along with what they're doing
[10:14:34.920 --> 10:14:39.920]  And so it's the great challenge, but they want war, they want stage terror attacks
[10:14:39.920 --> 10:14:43.920]  They want checkpoints, they want depression, they want control
[10:14:43.920 --> 10:14:49.920]  But if we speak out, if we get involved, then that counters their evil
[10:14:49.920 --> 10:14:55.920]  It's only our acquiescence that allows this to manifest, Fritz
[10:14:55.920 --> 10:15:07.920]  Yeah, I guess the analogy that I might make is God said he would spare a city if he found one righteous man
[10:15:07.920 --> 10:15:17.920]  And so let us be that one righteous person that allows God to spare our area, our city
[10:15:17.920 --> 10:15:25.920]  Yeah, that's the only reason North America is even still here with the great evil that controls us
[10:15:25.920 --> 10:15:32.920]  It's like Sodom and Gomorrah, you know, they're like, God, if we can find one person, I'm going to spare the city
[10:15:32.920 --> 10:15:36.920]  And that's what it comes down to is like Nineveh with a hundred year reprieve
[10:15:36.920 --> 10:15:41.920]  What we do shapes the world
[10:15:41.920 --> 10:15:45.920]  Exactly
[10:15:45.920 --> 10:15:47.920]  We're ready for the next listener
[10:15:47.920 --> 10:15:53.920]  Sure, sure, we'll go back to, Brian's gone, but I interrupted you with my zest
[10:15:53.920 --> 10:15:59.920]  Finish your point about God passing over cities
[10:15:59.920 --> 10:16:08.920]  One thing that happens is there's a prophetic pattern
[10:16:08.920 --> 10:16:19.920]  And that is God allows Satan to do certain things and then he goes beyond what he's allowed to
[10:16:19.920 --> 10:16:27.920]  Just for instance, like the legal system, maybe when they arrest you, instead of just sticking with the facts
[10:16:27.920 --> 10:16:32.920]  They go way beyond the facts, like they did in my case, they just made up facts
[10:16:32.920 --> 10:16:42.920]  Well, what that does is it allows God to move in on that situation and bring judgment on those people, those evil people
[10:16:42.920 --> 10:16:54.920]  So sometimes some of these things have been allowed by God because it's going to allow him to bring judgment on these people
[10:16:54.920 --> 10:17:05.920]  Because they're going to go beyond what God has, you know, just like in Job, God said, yes, you can touch him here, here, and here
[10:17:05.920 --> 10:17:08.920]  But don't go there, you know
[10:17:08.920 --> 10:17:17.920]  So there's a lot of spiritual dynamics going on and that's why I encourage people to stand up for what's right
[10:17:17.920 --> 10:17:24.920]  You know, people get so discouraged and they go, well, what can we do, you know, I mean, I'm just one person
[10:17:24.920 --> 10:17:29.920]  Well, one person can save a city, one person can turn things around
[10:17:29.920 --> 10:17:33.920]  Alex Jones is just one person, I'm just one person
[10:17:33.920 --> 10:17:36.920]  And so, you know
[10:17:36.920 --> 10:17:44.920]  No, I agree with you, Fritz, at the end of the day, I believe that's my mission is to show people as imperfect as I am or you are
[10:17:44.920 --> 10:17:48.920]  What one person can do, finish, go ahead, go ahead
[10:17:48.920 --> 10:17:56.920]  No, that's a good place to take the next question
[10:17:56.920 --> 10:18:00.920]  Alright, Brian and Houston is gone, let's talk to Joe and San Marcos
[10:18:00.920 --> 10:18:04.920]  And I guess San Marcos is in Texas too, I guess that's south of Austin
[10:18:04.920 --> 10:18:06.920]  Are you calling from Texas, Joe?
[10:18:06.920 --> 10:18:08.920]  Yeah, San Marcos
[10:18:08.920 --> 10:18:10.920]  Go ahead
[10:18:10.920 --> 10:18:17.920]  I'd like to, I think the root of the problem is psychopathy
[10:18:17.920 --> 10:18:26.920]  And I'd like you to go into detail about what psychopathy is, how brain scans of psychopaths show that they're different
[10:18:26.920 --> 10:18:32.920]  They are malfunctioning humans, almost like a cancer
[10:18:32.920 --> 10:18:43.920]  And if you could go into detail about what psychopathy is, how important it is for people to understand, to protect themselves
[10:18:43.920 --> 10:18:48.920]  Well, we know that maybe one out of 200-300 people, they debate the numbers as a psychopath
[10:18:48.920 --> 10:18:55.920]  And it doesn't just not feel people's pain, but actually seromasochistic or masochistic psychopaths
[10:18:55.920 --> 10:19:06.920]  And then you get into this whole point that, you know, myself, I don't feel violent against anybody until I see them hurting innocents, women, children
[10:19:06.920 --> 10:19:10.920]  And then it's a violent rage
[10:19:10.920 --> 10:19:14.920]  But see, they would actually enjoy hurting innocents, it's the opposite
[10:19:14.920 --> 10:19:17.920]  Fritz, what's your comment on that?
[10:19:17.920 --> 10:19:25.920]  I think the point he brought up allows me to introduce something very, very important
[10:19:25.920 --> 10:19:30.920]  A very important thing, I hope the listeners catch this
[10:19:30.920 --> 10:19:42.920]  Typically, people say the Illuminati can't do this or they can't do that because, and they extrapolate and think that the Illuminati think like they do
[10:19:42.920 --> 10:19:58.920]  If you look at brain scan of somebody who's a multiple personality, if you look at what the caller was talking about, people that are psychopaths and sociopaths
[10:19:58.920 --> 10:20:02.920]  Their brains are physically different
[10:20:02.920 --> 10:20:11.920]  We're not talking about people running the Illuminati that think like us at all
[10:20:11.920 --> 10:20:14.920]  They're totally different
[10:20:14.920 --> 10:20:20.920]  Do not think that these people, if they're even people, they're...
[10:20:20.920 --> 10:20:22.920]  They're not of this world
[10:20:22.920 --> 10:20:27.920]  I mean, spiritually, mentally, the brain scans, I've seen the maps, they're not us
[10:20:27.920 --> 10:20:30.920]  And that's why we have a blind spot to them
[10:20:30.920 --> 10:20:40.920]  Exactly, and that's an important point for people to get across is because they go, well, if I was in their shoes
[10:20:40.920 --> 10:20:44.920]  I would do this, this, and this. It has nothing to do with how you think
[10:20:44.920 --> 10:20:47.920]  They don't think anything like we do
[10:20:47.920 --> 10:20:53.920]  Nor are their brains physically the same as ours
[10:20:53.920 --> 10:20:59.920]  What's from your research? There aren't officially trying to create this in the general public, obviously
[10:20:59.920 --> 10:21:07.920]  But genetically or historically, how many people out of a thousand are like this?
[10:21:07.920 --> 10:21:19.920]  Well, the mind control here in the United States, when I went to prison, it was about one in 40 had the total Illuminati mind control
[10:21:19.920 --> 10:21:24.920]  It's probably a higher percentage now
[10:21:24.920 --> 10:21:28.920]  And that's a lot of multiple personalities walking around
[10:21:28.920 --> 10:21:33.920]  They give multiple personality disorder, they call it DID
[10:21:33.920 --> 10:21:40.920]  They give it a lot of other names, you know, bipolar, you know, or this or that
[10:21:40.920 --> 10:21:44.920]  And so it's...
[10:21:44.920 --> 10:21:48.920]  What's inducing it? A cocktail or the chemicals in the food, the TV?
[10:21:48.920 --> 10:21:53.920]  Because obviously most of them weren't actually taken to some facility
[10:21:53.920 --> 10:22:03.920]  Yeah, they're actually taking a lot of them to facilities, the facilities are a lot more...
[10:22:03.920 --> 10:22:05.920]  Numerous
[10:22:05.920 --> 10:22:09.920]  Available, and there's a lot more of them than one might realize
[10:22:09.920 --> 10:22:17.920]  And it doesn't take much to have a simple programming place
[10:22:17.920 --> 10:22:26.920]  Anyway, I didn't answer your question on the blacks
[10:22:26.920 --> 10:22:33.920]  Well, it just seems the New World Order has a particular fancy towards doing stuff to black folks
[10:22:33.920 --> 10:22:38.920]  Is that because they're just seen as on average as poor and it's kind of a fair game group like Native Americans?
[10:22:38.920 --> 10:22:40.920]  Or what's happening on that front?
[10:22:40.920 --> 10:22:49.920]  They have had a hatred against that racial group from early on and all down through their history
[10:22:49.920 --> 10:22:56.920]  They will use them, they will find blacks that they can use
[10:22:56.920 --> 10:22:58.920]  Herman Cain
[10:22:58.920 --> 10:23:14.920]  But they have an utter disdain for the race and I really can't explain it except that they think that they are superior
[10:23:14.920 --> 10:23:20.920]  And of course they feel that way towards the rest of us too
[10:23:20.920 --> 10:23:29.920]  No, I know, but I mean historically from your research, there is a HIV engineer and all that, why is that?
[10:23:29.920 --> 10:23:43.920]  Well, I think they consider the blacks kind of, I don't know, a subspecies or something that's a lower group
[10:23:43.920 --> 10:23:53.920]  That's a good question, there's a lot of prejudice amongst the Illuminati towards that, that's why you see within the masons
[10:23:53.920 --> 10:23:59.920]  You know, the Prince Hall Lodge, they say we believe in the brotherhood of all men
[10:23:59.920 --> 10:24:05.920]  But the blacks are the only race that have to have their own Lodge system, the Prince Hall Lodge system
[10:24:05.920 --> 10:24:19.920]  I don't have all the answers on that, I've sat there and listened to some of their thinking about blacks or this or that
[10:24:19.920 --> 10:24:25.920]  I guess if you really believe that stuff, you know, I guess that's a reason
[10:24:25.920 --> 10:24:34.920]  Alright, let's rampage through three final calls, Randy, Jeff and Bryson will let Rick Springmeyer go, author of Bloodlines of the Illuminati
[10:24:34.920 --> 10:24:37.920]  Let's go to Randy and Indiana, go ahead
[10:24:37.920 --> 10:24:40.920]  How you doing, Alex? Good
[10:24:40.920 --> 10:24:47.920]  Yeah, I'd like to thank you for help completing my awakening, I've felt pretty much all my life that things were wrong
[10:24:47.920 --> 10:24:55.920]  And just like Fritz said earlier, 9-11 was the catalyst that brought me to you and woke me up and rather fortuitous
[10:24:55.920 --> 10:25:04.920]  I caught the interview earlier this week with Fritz and I found the book online about the mind control
[10:25:04.920 --> 10:25:09.920]  And I've read up to the second chapter and just absolutely floored me
[10:25:09.920 --> 10:25:14.920]  And you guys were talking earlier about the rock music
[10:25:14.920 --> 10:25:28.920]  And I was just wondering, I've found a lot of songs that the message to me seems like what's going on and we need to be aware and eventually fight
[10:25:28.920 --> 10:25:29.920]  And I was just wondering what
[10:25:29.920 --> 10:25:35.920]  Well yeah, you got like news and all these other bands, I've talked to some of them, they're actually awake and it's not like one monolithic structure
[10:25:35.920 --> 10:25:45.920]  But certainly the 60s, 70s, that 80s, that period was there was control but now it doesn't seem from my research there's as much control over it
[10:25:45.920 --> 10:25:48.920]  Fritz?
[10:25:48.920 --> 10:25:56.920]  One of the things that's happened in the music industry is it's diversified, everybody can have their own little band that they like
[10:25:56.920 --> 10:26:10.920]  So yeah, there has been some of that going on like you say Alex where instead of having the big band, the Elvis Presley type person or Tom Dorsey band or whatever
[10:26:10.920 --> 10:26:18.920]  It's diversifying in recent years, that's something that's been going on while I was down in prison
[10:26:18.920 --> 10:26:28.920]  Yeah, I mean again, a lot of this clearly illuminati messages but I've talked to some of these people now and you hear the message about standing up against tyranny
[10:26:28.920 --> 10:26:38.920]  They've lost control, that's the thing, the globalists have control but more and more they're losing control, it's a great quandary, they're not all powerful
[10:26:38.920 --> 10:26:43.920]  Randy, thank you, Jeff in New York and Bryce and then we're done, Jeff go ahead
[10:26:43.920 --> 10:26:48.920]  Alex, Alex I love you, Alex grab a cup of coffee because I need you real quick, okay?
[10:26:48.920 --> 10:26:49.920]  Okay
[10:26:49.920 --> 10:26:55.920]  Fritz, the infamous bank robber, is that right? That's a joke
[10:26:55.920 --> 10:27:06.920]  I just was introduced to you recently on Alex's show and for the listeners go through YouTube and check out this gentleman's work, it's incredible
[10:27:06.920 --> 10:27:16.920]  Truly incredible, also I just want to throw something in real quick, Max Egan IGAN on YouTube also but Fritz, very nice to see you, you look great
[10:27:16.920 --> 10:27:28.920]  I need your help guys, listen I want to talk to you here, what I've been doing is taking inbound sales calls for let's say a major gaming company and I do that at home
[10:27:28.920 --> 10:27:41.920]  Okay, so I take these inbound calls at home and I don't know about ten years ago I put some commercials at light heartedly poked fun at George Bush back when I was still on the left right paradigm
[10:27:41.920 --> 10:27:55.920]  And ever since I've been experiencing some harassment you would say well now that I'm taking these inbound calls it has stepped up and it's interesting that you brought the black thing into it
[10:27:55.920 --> 10:28:12.920]  It's interesting because you know part of what they were doing called me N word lover for a while, now what they would do is actually, let's see I was having a conversation with my girlfriend about how we're all turning into ten dollar an hour slaves
[10:28:12.920 --> 10:28:28.920]  Five minutes later I get a call, the guy spells that as email and it comes to Euro laundry room slave to yahoo.com, so my question being, you know, is this like part of, do they have like minions out there?
[10:28:28.920 --> 10:28:37.920]  Obviously they can see, oh by the way they did tell me I was fixing myself some coffee and he said did you put enough cream in that coffee and hung up
[10:28:37.920 --> 10:28:45.920]  Well let me explain what's happened, they got algorithms that track you, that know who you are, that know when you tend to cook coffee
[10:28:45.920 --> 10:28:56.920]  They've got with these new smart meters that scan your electricity they can tell off the algorithm on your TV off the power fluctuation what you're watching
[10:28:56.920 --> 10:29:10.920]  That was in the San Francisco Chronicle today and they have millions in the US of people hired for department of defense, think tanks, consortiums, different groups to harass, to troll
[10:29:10.920 --> 10:29:17.920]  This is their army online, this is in the news, operation sock puppet, megaphone, all of that
[10:29:17.920 --> 10:29:31.920]  We will watch one person with twenty different handles on my website infowars.com having fake discussions about everyone agrees Alex Jones you know works for the Vatican or Kebler Elves or whatever
[10:29:31.920 --> 10:29:39.920]  Or the Illuminati or whatever and we will watch the same person, we let them operate because we're learning about these people but that's all admitted
[10:29:39.920 --> 10:29:51.920]  And so what happens is it's just gangs of crooks that try to knock down the nail that sticks up and there's a lot of this, this has been confirmed, this has been in the news, Fred's here coming on it
[10:29:51.920 --> 10:30:03.920]  Yes and once they start harassing somebody, once you're on the poop list it doesn't seem like you come up, it's just this thing will be ongoing for years
[10:30:03.920 --> 10:30:11.920]  And I know lots of people that have ongoing harassment year in and year out
[10:30:11.920 --> 10:30:22.920]  We call it enjoyment, the calls constantly at the house, the mail being sent to us from the harassment, the death threats, that's a sign you're over the target
[10:30:22.920 --> 10:30:25.920]  Yes, exactly
[10:30:25.920 --> 10:30:33.920]  Yes so just enjoy it sir, I mean that means you did the right thing, I mean this is a real badge of honor here, you want to really enjoy this
[10:30:33.920 --> 10:30:43.920]  Look what's happened to Fred's though, I mean what an incredible story for that to happen to him of course you know and now they're calling me pedophile
[10:30:43.920 --> 10:30:56.920]  Let me tell you, I actually changed location, went out west to New Mexico, ended up having tires slashed, cell phones stolen and keys stolen out of the ignition within 24 hours
[10:30:56.920 --> 10:31:02.920]  Went to Florida looking for work, same harassment, come back up to New York and my girlfriend's tires are slashed
[10:31:02.920 --> 10:31:09.920]  Well you might have worked in some project too, I've seen that with certain people that worked in things that weren't really clear what they were working in
[10:31:09.920 --> 10:31:17.920]  Thank you so much Jeff, final caller for Fred Springmeyer, Bryce in Missouri, you're our tail gunner, go ahead
[10:31:17.920 --> 10:31:26.920]  Alright well thank you for taking my call guys, I appreciate what you're doing, staying up this late at night, please excuse me for my cold
[10:31:26.920 --> 10:31:35.920]  I got a question and then I want to make a comment and then dev-tail that because I think I can answer that question about why blacks are targeted
[10:31:35.920 --> 10:31:52.920]  But my question is that I have a documentary shortly coming out and I use clips from you, Ike, Alan Watt, you name it, even Springmeyer, I have a clip from his book, Bloodlines of the Illuminati
[10:31:52.920 --> 10:32:10.920]  So I'm wondering, A, is it okay to use those clips in the film as long as it's non-profit, I mean we're just talking about a YouTube video and B, what's your take on the whole community of conspiracy theorists wanting to use each other's material?
[10:32:10.920 --> 10:32:22.920]  Yeah, let me stop right there, as long as you're using a small clip of something and analyzing it, it's fair use, it's whole works that are the issue, my mission is everything's out there, whatever
[10:32:22.920 --> 10:32:33.920]  There's a lot of folks that end fight with each other and territorially fight over information, you know it's better to not ask permission and ask for givens later than to worry
[10:32:33.920 --> 10:32:41.920]  People will call me and say, can I paint your website on my car? Well, number one, don't ask my permission, but yes, you've got a first amendment right
[10:32:41.920 --> 10:32:44.920]  So Fred's your comment on that
[10:32:44.920 --> 10:33:11.920]  Yeah, you have permission from me to use that small clip and while I was in prison, all of my materials been pirated and put up on the internet for free anyway, and in the long run it brought benefits to me and other people, so that's one of the blessings of the free flow of information
[10:33:11.920 --> 10:33:23.920]  As an author, you know, I'm reluctant to allow people to print my books and sell them, I know a few people have even done that
[10:33:23.920 --> 10:33:30.920]  Sure, they alter them too, I mean you've got to control your basic copyright for a full work or they can manipulate it
[10:33:30.920 --> 10:33:55.920]  Right, and people need to take into consideration the hard work and the money and the time that goes in to produce these things and realize that if you're stealing money from the person who's created this that you're actually making it harder for them to continue doing what they're doing
[10:33:55.920 --> 10:34:05.920]  Absolutely, well Fred's an incredible hour and 35 minute interview, I look forward to speaking to you soon in your book, One Line's the Illuminati, available at infowars.com
[10:34:05.920 --> 10:34:09.920]  If people want to contact you, what's the email?
[10:34:09.920 --> 10:34:23.920]  It's springmiremessagesathopmail.com and springmire is spelled S-P-R-I-N-G-M-E-I-E-R and then messages at hopmail.com
[10:34:23.920 --> 10:34:24.920]  Thank you
[10:34:24.920 --> 10:34:33.920]  Thank you Fred's, I know it's 1235 we're here at, so I'm going to let you go ahead and get some sleep, we'll talk to you soon, thank you for joining us
[10:34:33.920 --> 10:34:35.920]  Thanks Alex, I enjoyed it
[10:34:35.920 --> 10:34:36.920]  Thank you for coming on with us
[10:34:36.920 --> 10:35:05.920]  Alright, Aaron Dykes is going to come up after this video and we've already had the Tex Mars, Alfreda Desk, George Norrie, David Ike, Mike Adams, Webster Tarpley, Dither Catherine Albright, Joel Scalson coming up at 7am, they're going to have an incredible, never before seen, inside Skull and Bones information, 7 o'clock, 7am, that's 8 Eastern, am, I guess that'd be
[10:35:05.920 --> 10:35:27.920]  6 in the morning, no, 5 in the morning Pacific, 6 in the morning mountain, that's all coming up, Aaron Dykes is still in there working on that, and we've got more, Alan Watts coming up, Jim Mars, Bob Chapman of course, I'm going to go make myself lay down for about 4 or 5 hours and they're on the floor
[10:35:27.920 --> 10:35:44.920]  and then I'm going to come back here and I'll be live, hopefully re-energized, Jesse Ventura called me, talked to him and others several times this evening, the feds have thrown out his case, he's always asked for it was a day in court with his TSA groping, that's coming up
[10:35:44.920 --> 10:36:07.920]  I know at midnight, 1237 Pacific, 137 Mountain, 237 Central, 337 Eastern, there's a lot of folks still watching the free streams and helping these out to folks but if you haven't donated, if you don't have the funds, do not donate, I do not want money from people that are not in a good position
[10:36:07.920 --> 10:36:24.920]  but if you are in a good position, you're nuts, not to give to infowars.com, at infowarsmoneybomb.com, it's infowarsmoneybomb.com or infowars.com because we are the tip of the spear, there's nobody fighting the globalist as hardcore as we are, no one can doubt that
[10:36:24.920 --> 10:36:41.920]  and we want to hire some more people for the TV show and some more equipment and things and it just helps us be more robust and more powerful in this fight against the globalist, we're small but we're strong, like a nice pick going right into the new World Order's gut
[10:36:41.920 --> 10:37:02.920]  so we're going to be back in the morning, we'll also play a song called International by some of the other folks on our crew, we'll do that in the morning, if you're going to bed Chris, you can remind them, I'll play that song from Animal put out by Derek Einkopf and Chris and others
[10:37:02.920 --> 10:37:15.920]  that's right, Chris Ellanese in there, he wants his thing plugged, it is good music, you heard Weldon Henson earlier
[10:37:15.920 --> 10:37:37.920]  but if you haven't donated to infowars.com via the money bomb, you really should because we're on the front line, slugging toe-to-toe with the globalist risking our name, our treasure, our sacred honor, the whole nine yards and we're not going to have the operators here for another 30 minutes or so so you want to call and donate 888-2533139, 888-2533139, that's
[10:37:37.920 --> 10:37:55.920]  right, 888-2533139 or infowarsmoneybomb.com and if that site's sluggish because of all the people visiting it, infowars.com, you can find it all right there, we're going to go to a video, what have we got next coming up video wise?
[10:37:55.920 --> 10:38:11.920]  Yeah, we'll do a couple minutes of music and then go to Aaron Dykes and he will continue with your calls and a bunch of other news straight ahead and then the premiere of the Scullin' Bones special incredible information, really shock we've been bringing you this type of incredible breaking news.
[10:38:11.920 --> 10:38:26.920]  We've been sitting on top of like an evil chicken for about a year as we try to get it together, horrible hen and then we'll get to all the other guys, Paul Watson's coming up and others to spread the word about the free video links.
[10:38:26.920 --> 10:38:46.920]  I'm going to punch out for a few hours and come back re-energized and Ventura's coming up a lot more, so stay with us, it's infowarsmoneybomb.com 2011, your choice to donate to the absolute tip of the spear going right into the eye of the Cyclopsian New World Order, stay with us.
[10:38:46.920 --> 10:38:58.920]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[10:38:58.920 --> 10:39:16.920]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[10:39:16.920 --> 10:39:31.920]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[10:39:31.920 --> 10:39:46.920]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrismPlanet.tv.

[10:40:36.920 --> 10:40:59.920]  They will stop degrading us. They will not control us. We will be victorious.
[10:41:06.920 --> 10:41:21.920]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states in the world. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[10:41:21.920 --> 10:41:42.920]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states in the world. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[10:41:42.920 --> 10:41:54.920]  We are back on the continuing 24 plus hour broadcast for the Info Wars Money Bomb. It's now November 4th. We started, of course, on November 3rd. I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in.
[10:41:54.920 --> 10:42:04.920]  Alex will be back in a few hours and we're going to be joined in just a moment by an activist named Dan Dix. Press for Truth in Canada. He's done a lot of good work.
[10:42:04.920 --> 10:42:14.920]  And not only is it 2.43 in the morning. Yes, I'm a little tired. I've been editing this is a piece over here in the other room for the past 10 hours trying to get it ready for air later.
[10:42:14.920 --> 10:42:23.920]  Not only is it late in the night if you're still listening out there and we hope you are, but it is late in the game and it's no unspecific time in history.
[10:42:23.920 --> 10:42:35.920]  I'm going to get more into this later, but for a long time people weren't literate. Nobody knew what was going on. And it's very much what people like Zbigniew Brzezinski have talked about. This is the time of the global awakening.
[10:42:35.920 --> 10:42:44.920]  And it's really a big challenge of which direction it's going to go. So supporting an organization like Info Wars is more than just something in this limited time now.
[10:42:44.920 --> 10:42:54.920]  It's something that you need to do because this is the time in history. Things are changing now. And if we don't influence the way things are going, we'll never have another chance.
[10:42:54.920 --> 10:43:02.920]  So if you believe in the Info Wars mission, carry out similar work yourself, donate to us, get the word out, spread the DVDs and all of that.
[10:43:02.920 --> 10:43:20.920]  But we especially need your support here at InfoWars.com through this money bomb vehicle and the rest of it because we need to grow and reach people while we still can, while we have the power of the Internet before they clamp down and before we enter fully this global society so we could try to change things.
[10:43:20.920 --> 10:43:24.920]  Do we have Dan now on the line?
[10:43:24.920 --> 10:43:37.920]  Yeah. So Dan Dix is somebody, I first met him back in 2006 in Canada at the Bilderberg meeting. And I know he had done some activism before that, but he spoke on our cameras, ended up in the in-game film.
[10:43:37.920 --> 10:43:45.920]  And I know that was one of the events that really helped wake him up, not only to what's going on, but to the need for he himself to take action.
[10:43:45.920 --> 10:43:56.920]  And he has definitely been one of the people taking action out there as we all need to. Again, if you can't donate, can't spread the word, get out there physically on the street, talk to people, make videos yourself.
[10:43:56.920 --> 10:44:09.920]  And Dan Dix has done that. He's made at least three, if not four films now. We've carried them. We have his latest one into the fire. Dan, are you there?
[10:44:09.920 --> 10:44:12.920]  I can't hear you right now. Is it coming through?
[10:44:12.920 --> 10:44:15.920]  Oh, you got me now?
[10:44:15.920 --> 10:44:20.920]  Hey Dan, great to have you with us. And what can we talk about here tonight?
[10:44:20.920 --> 10:44:32.920]  Oh, whatever you want to get into, man. Speaking about meeting you back in 2006, I definitely remember that being interviewed for Endgame, and that was a very cool experience.
[10:44:32.920 --> 10:44:42.920]  You know, back then, I remember I used to tell a lot of people about you, Aaron. I would often describe you as the man behind the man.
[10:44:42.920 --> 10:44:51.920]  Because obviously, you know, it's such a big production going on over there, but a lot of times people don't realize. I mean, Alex is the face of it all.
[10:44:51.920 --> 10:44:58.920]  But there's a whole group of people behind him who are who are integral to the operation and making it all work.
[10:44:58.920 --> 10:45:05.920]  So I would often refer to you as the man behind the man, and I just want to say it's great now to see you getting out in front, getting on the camera.
[10:45:05.920 --> 10:45:13.920]  I got your own YouTube channel and the web, you know, your Facebook and everything and getting more active, and it's awesome. I'm loving it.
[10:45:13.920 --> 10:45:22.920]  Yeah, it's not even something I really intended to do, but it's what Alex talks about a lot of times. The man who gets into the arena, that's the Teddy Roosevelt quote, I think.
[10:45:22.920 --> 10:45:30.920]  I remember personally back to the time when I kind of knew instinctively 9-11 was an inside job, but I was real depressed about it for a long time.
[10:45:30.920 --> 10:45:39.920]  I saw so many people taking the bait, and I didn't know what I could do about it myself. I didn't understand our power to transform really everyone's reaction to that kind of stuff.
[10:45:39.920 --> 10:45:50.920]  We won so many victories on that, and just me personally getting into the battle has transformed so many things in my own life, but also helped me reach other people, turning on other people.
[10:45:50.920 --> 10:45:53.920]  I know you've done the same thing, Dan.
[10:45:53.920 --> 10:46:01.920]  Yeah, man, that's really what it's all about is you got to just dive in, head first, and take this kind of thing head on.
[10:46:01.920 --> 10:46:08.920]  When people are wanting to get active and wanting to get involved in this movement, that's really all it takes.
[10:46:08.920 --> 10:46:14.920]  I mean, anybody can take this up and do it themselves, especially nowadays.
[10:46:14.920 --> 10:46:23.920]  I mean, a YouTube channel is free. A WordPress blog is free. You already pretty much probably have a camera in your pocket with your cell phone,
[10:46:23.920 --> 10:46:29.920]  so it's really just a matter of taking that first initial step and doing it.
[10:46:29.920 --> 10:46:37.920]  Like I did in 2006, I had went to a lot of events before that, but that was pretty much the first time I brought a camera with me,
[10:46:37.920 --> 10:46:44.920]  and that's what gave me, I had the bug ever since then. I've had the itch to continue to want to do it ever since then,
[10:46:44.920 --> 10:46:53.920]  and that's really what it takes, man, is just diving in head first and taking a stab at it, and anybody can do this, and that's the encouraging thing about it all.
[10:46:53.920 --> 10:46:58.920]  That's what I mean. The information has come to be not only free, but priceless.
[10:46:58.920 --> 10:47:01.920]  This is the time we can use that information to transform things.
[10:47:01.920 --> 10:47:08.920]  Hundreds, thousands, whatever years ago, not only can people not read, but even if you could read, you couldn't afford a book, basically,
[10:47:08.920 --> 10:47:16.920]  unless you were the priest class or the royalty. Now we have all these tools at our fingertips, and if we don't use them, what's the point anyway?
[10:47:16.920 --> 10:47:23.920]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's no doubt technology is a double-edged sword, and the internet right now,
[10:47:23.920 --> 10:47:32.920]  I mean, we can essentially, in certain ways, use the system against the system, and that's the beautiful thing about the times that we're living in now,
[10:47:32.920 --> 10:47:41.920]  and we have to take full advantage of it now, as we can, because it's tough to say how much longer it's going to continue like this,
[10:47:41.920 --> 10:47:52.920]  because I believe the establishment realizes that this movement is getting absolutely huge, and they're going to try to figure out a way to stifle our efforts.
[10:47:52.920 --> 10:48:03.920]  So, right now is the perfect time to get active, and if you haven't taken that initial step, that first step, I would say do it, just go for it, man.
[10:48:03.920 --> 10:48:15.920]  Get a YouTube channel, start a website, start putting yourself out there, and just expose and raise awareness about issues that you feel people need to hear about,
[10:48:15.920 --> 10:48:23.920]  and that's where it's at, and then, you know, as they often say, down the rabbit hole, you'll go, and hopefully you'll just continue the work,
[10:48:23.920 --> 10:48:27.920]  so it's a great time to be involved in the fight against the New World Order.
[10:48:27.920 --> 10:48:33.920]  Absolutely, and obviously it's not about knowing everything when you first get out there, it's about getting out there and doing it,
[10:48:33.920 --> 10:48:39.920]  and beginning to grasp what's going on, but at the same time, we have stuff like the Occupy Wall Street movement,
[10:48:39.920 --> 10:48:46.920]  and a lot of the righteous anger from the masses, the 99%, as they like to call it, really, the 99.999%,
[10:48:46.920 --> 10:48:53.920]  I think it's about a million to one ratio of the true elites, but the point is, many of them, as well-meaning as they may be,
[10:48:53.920 --> 10:48:58.920]  are not sophisticated enough to even understand how the Federal Reserve affects our lives,
[10:48:58.920 --> 10:49:04.920]  and so all the more reason that we need well-educated info warriors to get out there and try to spread the message
[10:49:04.920 --> 10:49:08.920]  and get people on our side recognizing the right issues.
[10:49:08.920 --> 10:49:15.920]  Now, I know a lot of your films have dealt with the past G20 meetings, they have another one coming up in Cannes,
[10:49:15.920 --> 10:49:22.920]  if I'm not mistaken, and one of the things you highlight in there is all the attempts to steer those protests in the wrong direction,
[10:49:22.920 --> 10:49:30.920]  provocateurs, people infiltrating, trying to spread the message and change it, and obviously that can go in both directions,
[10:49:30.920 --> 10:49:40.920]  and we've really seen Occupy being drawn towards the seemingly promising global solutions that they have ready and waiting.
[10:49:40.920 --> 10:49:46.920]  How do we get people steered in the right direction, and also what kind of infiltration and provocateur things
[10:49:46.920 --> 10:49:50.920]  have we seen in this movement and in the coming G20 meetings?
[10:49:50.920 --> 10:49:55.920]  Well, with the G20 kicking off today, I believe, in France,
[10:49:55.920 --> 10:50:01.920]  I often refer to it as the traveling circus of tyranny, because that's really what it does.
[10:50:01.920 --> 10:50:11.920]  Every city that it goes to every year, they're pretty much not only conditioning the people and showing them the pure power and might that they have,
[10:50:11.920 --> 10:50:18.920]  they are also conditioning the police forces to go ahead and enforce all of these things,
[10:50:18.920 --> 10:50:25.920]  and of course, this is an area where a lot of people have learned about this group called the Black Block, as you mentioned,
[10:50:25.920 --> 10:50:35.920]  and as you'll see in my film, Into the Fire, these guys pretty much anywhere where the Black Block was, police were nowhere to be found.
[10:50:35.920 --> 10:50:45.920]  What ended up happening is you had a group of about 70 or 80 of these guys who were pretty much given a green light to go ahead and rampage the city
[10:50:45.920 --> 10:50:53.920]  and smash up the banks and do whatever they want downtown, but that is what the elite wants.
[10:50:53.920 --> 10:51:00.920]  They want you to get out into the streets, they want you to start smashing things up and causing a big scene, a big wreckage,
[10:51:00.920 --> 10:51:07.920]  so that they can step in and say, whoa, look at these guys, look how crazy this is, we're going to have to step in and deal with the situation.
[10:51:07.920 --> 10:51:13.920]  It all goes back to this whole order out of chaos concept, which they're doing now,
[10:51:13.920 --> 10:51:18.920]  and I do worry a little bit about the current Occupy movement.
[10:51:18.920 --> 10:51:24.920]  I've been speaking with a lot of the people here in Toronto, and I'm starting to feel it's kind of 50-50.
[10:51:24.920 --> 10:51:30.920]  I mean, there's a lot of people around here who are fully aware of the problems with fractional reserve banking,
[10:51:30.920 --> 10:51:36.920]  and the Bank of Canada does have the ability to print its own money interest-free, but we don't do that.
[10:51:36.920 --> 10:51:46.920]  So a lot of people are aware of that. However, I'm still finding a lot of these anti-capitalist type people who are pushing for socialism and communism
[10:51:46.920 --> 10:51:51.920]  and kind of trying to steer the movement into a direction which is not going to help anyone.
[10:51:51.920 --> 10:52:01.920]  So certainly it's something we have to keep an eye on because it's tough to say right now where this thing is going to go.
[10:52:01.920 --> 10:52:06.920]  Yeah, but we do know they're offering all these global solutions, so many different groups.
[10:52:06.920 --> 10:52:12.920]  None of them officially speaking for the movement are trying to draw people into whether it's a global Tobin tax
[10:52:12.920 --> 10:52:19.920]  or whatever the solution may be, new global constitution, supposedly trying to democratize the IMF
[10:52:19.920 --> 10:52:25.920]  and other really awful hegemonic global institutions, Dan.
[10:52:25.920 --> 10:52:30.920]  That has to play into these G20 meetings. What are they aiming for specifically?
[10:52:30.920 --> 10:52:33.920]  Well, that's why we need to get to the root of the problem.
[10:52:33.920 --> 10:52:41.920]  That's why people need to focus on what the real root of the problem is, and it's the issuance of currency out of thin air,
[10:52:41.920 --> 10:52:48.920]  the ability for private banks to print money and lend it out at interest.
[10:52:48.920 --> 10:52:54.920]  People are aware that our whole financial institutions are a major problem.
[10:52:54.920 --> 10:52:59.920]  That's why there's such huge protests that come out to the G20 summits.
[10:52:59.920 --> 10:53:05.920]  Again, we just need to continue to raise awareness about what we feel the real issues are,
[10:53:05.920 --> 10:53:11.920]  and hopefully people in this occupation movement are paying attention,
[10:53:11.920 --> 10:53:17.920]  and they'll start working towards these solutions which are actually going to benefit the people
[10:53:17.920 --> 10:53:23.920]  and not the very system that they're fighting against.
[10:53:23.920 --> 10:53:29.920]  Yeah, we'll see how this all develops, but of course, another thing these groups like the IMF have done
[10:53:29.920 --> 10:53:36.920]  have really cast a wide net that gradually over time draws in all these client states into this new world order system,
[10:53:36.920 --> 10:53:43.920]  really making us all debt slaves, and so if we don't figure this out, the end of it all is going to be coming soon.
[10:53:43.920 --> 10:53:48.920]  But of course, everything's changing right now. We've got the whole European zone in crisis,
[10:53:48.920 --> 10:53:54.920]  and they're ready to blame the people for not accepting this debt for the whole fall, the next part of the crash,
[10:53:54.920 --> 10:53:57.920]  but we know who set this up, we know who designed it.
[10:53:57.920 --> 10:54:04.920]  Yeah, for sure, and we have a fairly good idea of where this could potentially lead.
[10:54:04.920 --> 10:54:16.920]  One aspect of the occupation movement that somewhat worries me is how it all could potentially tie into this new age type of movement
[10:54:16.920 --> 10:54:26.920]  and type of agenda about this unified consciousness concept and having the whole world unified globally under one particular issue.
[10:54:26.920 --> 10:54:36.920]  I think people need to be careful and be aware that it's very quite possible that sometimes some things within the truth movement
[10:54:36.920 --> 10:54:41.920]  could be used as that vehicle that the new world order needs.
[10:54:41.920 --> 10:54:50.920]  I have hope that people are going to do the right thing.
[10:54:50.920 --> 10:54:55.920]  Things are going well because people are getting out in the streets. That's a beautiful thing, basically.
[10:54:55.920 --> 10:55:01.920]  People are getting active, people are getting out in the streets, they're realizing things need to change,
[10:55:01.920 --> 10:55:09.920]  and that's a good thing. We just have to be careful that when this gets onto a massive global scale with everybody on the same page,
[10:55:09.920 --> 10:55:12.920]  we've got to remember that's part of the goals of the new world order.
[10:55:12.920 --> 10:55:17.920]  So it's a tricky one, but we've got to watch out for that.
[10:55:17.920 --> 10:55:25.920]  Yeah, well said, Dan. Why don't you tell us about some of the stuff you've seen in the past at these G20 events with the police provocateurs,
[10:55:25.920 --> 10:55:31.920]  how they were identified, and what kind of divisive actions they caused so people can look out for it in the future?
[10:55:31.920 --> 10:55:41.920]  Sure. My first experience with that was actually in 2007 in Montebello for the SPP summit.
[10:55:41.920 --> 10:55:51.920]  I went there to cover it, and that's when the infamous three agent provocateurs were caught red-handed,
[10:55:51.920 --> 10:55:57.920]  dressed up as aggressive protesters, they had the masks and the rocks in their hands,
[10:55:57.920 --> 10:56:03.920]  and the Quebec police ended up admitting to it, and they were totally caught red-handed,
[10:56:03.920 --> 10:56:10.920]  and it opened up Canadian's eyes to the fact that the Canadian government is willing to go to these lengths,
[10:56:10.920 --> 10:56:16.920]  these fascist lengths, to in order to stifle and to silence a legitimate protest.
[10:56:16.920 --> 10:56:22.920]  So it's a common tactic that is being used to try to silence the people,
[10:56:22.920 --> 10:56:30.920]  and there's no doubt that there's a good possibility that a lot of that took place at the G20 in Toronto.
[10:56:30.920 --> 10:56:37.920]  When you have a group like the Black Block, it's so perfectly convenient for that type of situation,
[10:56:37.920 --> 10:56:42.920]  and as you'll see in our film, Into the Fire, there are some very questionable clips
[10:56:42.920 --> 10:56:48.920]  where members of the Black Block can be seen running behind a police line
[10:56:48.920 --> 10:56:53.920]  where the police are blocking off the protesters from the police,
[10:56:53.920 --> 10:56:57.920]  and you'll see a couple guys in Black Block clothing go running through the line.
[10:56:57.920 --> 10:57:03.920]  So that raises an eyebrow, and that gets us wondering what exactly is going on.
[10:57:03.920 --> 10:57:13.920]  It's so hard when you have 22 different jurisdictions of police came into the city that weekend from all over Canada.
[10:57:13.920 --> 10:57:19.920]  So these guys are not listening to their regular bosses.
[10:57:19.920 --> 10:57:21.920]  They're listening to the peace in their ear.
[10:57:21.920 --> 10:57:26.920]  When they're told to march west, they're going to march west.
[10:57:26.920 --> 10:57:30.920]  When they're told to go and kettle this small group of people,
[10:57:30.920 --> 10:57:33.920]  they're going to do it and not really question their orders.
[10:57:33.920 --> 10:57:36.920]  So that's another big part of the problem,
[10:57:36.920 --> 10:57:40.920]  and another way that the Black Block is able to go in and do their things.
[10:57:40.920 --> 10:57:44.920]  I mean, there were stand-down orders here in Toronto.
[10:57:44.920 --> 10:57:47.920]  Some of the police have come out and said,
[10:57:47.920 --> 10:57:51.920]  we were ordered, we were told, do not engage.
[10:57:51.920 --> 10:57:54.920]  So again, they were just listening to the peace in their ear,
[10:57:54.920 --> 10:58:01.920]  and I think a lot of the police around here felt that they themselves were manipulated.
[10:58:01.920 --> 10:58:06.920]  They had to carry out this Public Works Protection Act law,
[10:58:06.920 --> 10:58:08.920]  which ended up being a big lie.
[10:58:08.920 --> 10:58:13.920]  We were all led to believe that we couldn't film within five metres of this fence
[10:58:13.920 --> 10:58:17.920]  and that we had to present our ID at pretty much any time.
[10:58:17.920 --> 10:58:21.920]  It turns out that's not the case. It turned out not to be true.
[10:58:21.920 --> 10:58:24.920]  Toronto Chief Bill Blair at the time came out and admitted,
[10:58:24.920 --> 10:58:28.920]  yeah, you know what? Well, I was just trying to keep the bad guys out,
[10:58:28.920 --> 10:58:30.920]  so we did what we had to do.
[10:58:30.920 --> 10:58:33.920]  So some of the things that went on at the G20 there in Toronto,
[10:58:33.920 --> 10:58:39.920]  just unbelievable, and we did our best to document the whole event
[10:58:39.920 --> 10:58:43.920]  pretty much chronologically throughout the entire weekend.
[10:58:43.920 --> 10:58:47.920]  So if anybody, you want to see it for yourself, we have it online.
[10:58:47.920 --> 10:58:50.920]  You can go on YouTube, just type in into the fire,
[10:58:50.920 --> 10:58:56.920]  and of course you can get the dbd at infowords.com or press for truth.ca.
[10:58:56.920 --> 10:59:01.920]  And we encourage you to do that because we went all out on this particular DVD.
[10:59:01.920 --> 10:59:05.920]  We got hours and hours of extras, extended interviews,
[10:59:05.920 --> 10:59:09.920]  and a lot of special features and behind the scenes stuff.
[10:59:09.920 --> 10:59:14.920]  So if you want to support us, pick one up from press for truth.ca or infowords.com.
[10:59:14.920 --> 10:59:18.920]  But if you'd like to just see it for yourself, just go on to YouTube and check it out
[10:59:18.920 --> 10:59:20.920]  and you'll see what I'm talking about.
[10:59:20.920 --> 10:59:24.920]  And of course it is important to support all the great Infowars activists out there.
[10:59:24.920 --> 10:59:27.920]  That's how we help build each other up and how we get that word out.
[10:59:27.920 --> 10:59:29.920]  That's how we reach everyone.
[10:59:29.920 --> 10:59:31.920]  And here we are at 3 o'clock.
[10:59:31.920 --> 10:59:36.920]  I believe that puts us 16 hours into this marathon transition, transmission.
[10:59:36.920 --> 10:59:40.920]  I just want to make sure we thank all the people out there who've been giving money to us,
[10:59:40.920 --> 10:59:44.920]  who've been helping us grow, those who can't give money, spreading the word,
[10:59:44.920 --> 10:59:47.920]  sharing the link to this broadcast.
[10:59:47.920 --> 10:59:49.920]  It's not too late to do that.
[10:59:49.920 --> 10:59:52.920]  Also sharing all the free films that are out there from Alex Jones.
[10:59:52.920 --> 10:59:55.920]  We sell them on DVD also, but they're available on YouTube
[10:59:55.920 --> 10:59:58.920]  and the other platforms, Dan Dick's Film and the rest of them.
[10:59:58.920 --> 11:00:01.920]  And it's so important to get that word out.
[11:00:01.920 --> 11:00:05.920]  You know, right now we see the current G20 meeting in Cairns.
[11:00:05.920 --> 11:00:10.920]  A lot of the protesters there say they're joining up with the Occupy protesters
[11:00:10.920 --> 11:00:12.920]  who are now worldwide.
[11:00:12.920 --> 11:00:15.920]  And then at the same time we see in New York City, for instance,
[11:00:15.920 --> 11:00:19.920]  the police being bought really in many cases as a private security
[11:00:19.920 --> 11:00:23.920]  to work with the Wall Street firms to keep those protesters under check
[11:00:23.920 --> 11:00:28.920]  and just more generally to occupy the downtown area
[11:00:28.920 --> 11:00:32.920]  with their own surveillance and police state grid that is privately driven
[11:00:32.920 --> 11:00:35.920]  but also uses public resources.
[11:00:35.920 --> 11:00:37.920]  And so that's something to keep an eye on.
[11:00:37.920 --> 11:00:40.920]  But if you believe in this InfoWars mission,
[11:00:40.920 --> 11:00:44.920]  it's important you either donate or otherwise help us grow in one way or another.
[11:00:44.920 --> 11:00:47.920]  We have to reach more people while we still have time,
[11:00:47.920 --> 11:00:49.920]  while we have access to these wonderful platforms,
[11:00:49.920 --> 11:00:54.920]  the double-edged sword that technology gives us as things change
[11:00:54.920 --> 11:00:58.920]  and hopefully don't move further into this global state.
[11:00:58.920 --> 11:01:02.920]  You know, they've sold us on globalization saying how great it is
[11:01:02.920 --> 11:01:06.920]  that somehow, although it's flawed, it'll eventually become a benefit for everyone.
[11:01:06.920 --> 11:01:09.920]  But at the same time we've seen a race to the bottom,
[11:01:09.920 --> 11:01:12.920]  nobody really focuses on how they've shipped out the jobs,
[11:01:12.920 --> 11:01:16.920]  deindustrialized the U.S., shipped the jobs to China,
[11:01:16.920 --> 11:01:19.920]  where there's agreements for basically slave labor in many cases
[11:01:19.920 --> 11:01:23.920]  and just really cheap products that don't build up the country.
[11:01:23.920 --> 11:01:25.920]  Something maybe cheaper at Walmart,
[11:01:25.920 --> 11:01:31.920]  but it doesn't allow an interchange of decentralized independent businesses to grow.
[11:01:31.920 --> 11:01:34.920]  It sucks out really the backbone of America
[11:01:34.920 --> 11:01:38.920]  and leaves just that corporate facade running our whole country.
[11:01:38.920 --> 11:01:42.920]  That's, everything has really kind of hollowed out in that way.
[11:01:42.920 --> 11:01:45.920]  It's time we admit it and it's time we do something about it.
[11:01:45.920 --> 11:01:47.920]  Dan Dick, your comments.
[11:01:47.920 --> 11:01:49.920]  Yeah, absolutely.
[11:01:49.920 --> 11:01:55.920]  Another area which the globalization is fast-tracking its way right now
[11:01:55.920 --> 11:01:57.920]  in regards to the North American Union.
[11:01:57.920 --> 11:02:02.920]  I mean, this agenda has been on the table for a long, long time now.
[11:02:02.920 --> 11:02:06.920]  And recently, even in the last few weeks,
[11:02:06.920 --> 11:02:08.920]  a lot of things are coming together.
[11:02:08.920 --> 11:02:12.920]  I know the, I believe it's called the Interstate, the I-69,
[11:02:12.920 --> 11:02:17.920]  pretty much the NAFTA Superhighway is nearing completion.
[11:02:17.920 --> 11:02:19.920]  That's definitely underway.
[11:02:19.920 --> 11:02:22.920]  And that's something that we have to be very aware of,
[11:02:22.920 --> 11:02:27.920]  cautious of and vigilant of here in Canada, U.S. and Mexico.
[11:02:27.920 --> 11:02:31.920]  And again, that's another topic that we've covered in United We Fall,
[11:02:31.920 --> 11:02:35.920]  is this whole concept of those three countries coming in together,
[11:02:35.920 --> 11:02:38.920]  very similar to what we saw with the European Union.
[11:02:38.920 --> 11:02:43.920]  So yeah, they're ramping up their efforts as well.
[11:02:43.920 --> 11:02:48.920]  So that's why it is so important at this time to continue the fight.
[11:02:48.920 --> 11:02:52.920]  And I would encourage people also to do whatever you can to donate
[11:02:52.920 --> 11:02:55.920]  to themoneybombatinfowars.com.
[11:02:55.920 --> 11:02:59.920]  It's amazing what you guys have been able to do in the 15 years
[11:02:59.920 --> 11:03:00.920]  that you've been doing this.
[11:03:00.920 --> 11:03:04.920]  And especially since last Moneybomb, you've expanded your operation
[11:03:04.920 --> 11:03:06.920]  in such a huge way.
[11:03:06.920 --> 11:03:08.920]  It's very impressive. It's very encouraging.
[11:03:08.920 --> 11:03:09.920]  It's very awe-inspiring.
[11:03:09.920 --> 11:03:15.920]  And I want to encourage people to do the same as well, Aaron.
[11:03:15.920 --> 11:03:19.920]  Yeah, and you mentioned the NAFTA Superhighways.
[11:03:19.920 --> 11:03:21.920]  That's one of the many areas where we fought back.
[11:03:21.920 --> 11:03:22.920]  We've said no.
[11:03:22.920 --> 11:03:25.920]  We've told them we don't want this North American Union.
[11:03:25.920 --> 11:03:27.920]  They said it doesn't exist.
[11:03:27.920 --> 11:03:29.920]  People continue to bring out the agenda.
[11:03:29.920 --> 11:03:30.920]  And they've continued to play possum.
[11:03:30.920 --> 11:03:33.920]  I know here in Texas, there was really a rally cry
[11:03:33.920 --> 11:03:36.920]  that they had been defeated, that the whole project was somehow called off.
[11:03:36.920 --> 11:03:41.920]  But then if you drive down highways, I know I went down Highway 77
[11:03:41.920 --> 11:03:44.920]  that goes down to South Padre Island and so forth.
[11:03:44.920 --> 11:03:49.920]  And it tells you how the new NAFTA Super Corridor is soon to be coming in,
[11:03:49.920 --> 11:03:51.920]  you know, toll roads that they're putting up.
[11:03:51.920 --> 11:03:54.920]  So they're still moving this agenda forward,
[11:03:54.920 --> 11:03:57.920]  not always calling it what they originally were calling it.
[11:03:57.920 --> 11:04:02.920]  And with the larger North American Union, you've seen that fought back.
[11:04:02.920 --> 11:04:06.920]  But at the same time, you've seen greater border things coming forward.
[11:04:06.920 --> 11:04:10.920]  The stuff with the drug cartels, fast and furious ties into that.
[11:04:10.920 --> 11:04:12.920]  Dan Dix.
[11:04:12.920 --> 11:04:15.920]  Yeah, of course, of course, they're going to continue to tell us
[11:04:15.920 --> 11:04:17.920]  that this is going to be for our benefit.
[11:04:17.920 --> 11:04:21.920]  This is going to be beneficial for trade.
[11:04:21.920 --> 11:04:26.920]  It's going to move goods and services in and out of the countries quicker and easier.
[11:04:26.920 --> 11:04:29.920]  But again, this is the facade.
[11:04:29.920 --> 11:04:32.920]  This is what they're trying to make you believe, really,
[11:04:32.920 --> 11:04:36.920]  it's all about, you know, the end game is joining the three together.
[11:04:36.920 --> 11:04:40.920]  I mean, in our film, United We Fall, we talked to a lot of the major players,
[11:04:40.920 --> 11:04:43.920]  a lot of the guys who were really involved in the push for this thing.
[11:04:43.920 --> 11:04:47.920]  We interviewed Bilderberg members and trilateral commission members
[11:04:47.920 --> 11:04:49.920]  and members of the CFR.
[11:04:49.920 --> 11:04:52.920]  We spoke with so many different people.
[11:04:52.920 --> 11:04:56.920]  We also got, you know, a lot of activists like Luka Brnowski
[11:04:56.920 --> 11:05:00.920]  and we spoke with Alex Jones and people like that.
[11:05:00.920 --> 11:05:06.920]  So the subtitle of the film is Three Nations, Two Sides, One Union,
[11:05:06.920 --> 11:05:11.920]  because we really wanted people to hear it from the horse's mouth
[11:05:11.920 --> 11:05:15.920]  so they can get an idea of what these guys are actually pushing for
[11:05:15.920 --> 11:05:19.920]  and then also hear it from the alternative information side
[11:05:19.920 --> 11:05:22.920]  to get that viewpoint out there as well.
[11:05:22.920 --> 11:05:29.920]  If people are interested in learning about what this whole North American Union agenda is all about,
[11:05:29.920 --> 11:05:32.920]  again, I would encourage you to either check it out online.
[11:05:32.920 --> 11:05:34.920]  It's called United We Fall.
[11:05:34.920 --> 11:05:36.920]  You can find it on YouTube.
[11:05:36.920 --> 11:05:40.920]  And again, if you want to support Infowars.com or PressForTruth.ca,
[11:05:40.920 --> 11:05:42.920]  we'd ask that you grab the DVD.
[11:05:42.920 --> 11:05:45.920]  We got a lot of good special features on that one as well.
[11:05:45.920 --> 11:05:47.920]  Yeah, and look what Infowars has done over the years.
[11:05:47.920 --> 11:05:50.920]  We've talked about this, but we've given spotlights to people,
[11:05:50.920 --> 11:05:53.920]  like you said, like Luke Radowski to yourself, to so many others,
[11:05:53.920 --> 11:05:56.920]  get people to become active, show what they can do,
[11:05:56.920 --> 11:05:58.920]  and then others come along as well.
[11:05:58.920 --> 11:05:59.920]  I mean, that's just two names.
[11:05:59.920 --> 11:06:02.920]  There's been hundreds of people who've moved through this platform,
[11:06:02.920 --> 11:06:06.920]  who've helped shine a light, and we continue to grow.
[11:06:06.920 --> 11:06:09.920]  So that's why it's important that you support us.
[11:06:09.920 --> 11:06:15.920]  You know, throughout history, there's been a trend that we are treated
[11:06:15.920 --> 11:06:20.920]  as feudal slaves, either outright slaves or tenant farmers of various kinds
[11:06:20.920 --> 11:06:22.920]  throughout the years.
[11:06:22.920 --> 11:06:26.920]  Information has always been a power for those ruling classes,
[11:06:26.920 --> 11:06:28.920]  and the people have never had that information.
[11:06:28.920 --> 11:06:31.920]  This 20th century, now the 21st century,
[11:06:31.920 --> 11:06:37.920]  has really been the first time that really everyone has had access.
[11:06:37.920 --> 11:06:40.920]  Of course, not everyone is literate, but everyone has the chance,
[11:06:40.920 --> 11:06:43.920]  really, at least in the Western world, maybe not in the third world.
[11:06:43.920 --> 11:06:45.920]  And this is a real chance that we have.
[11:06:45.920 --> 11:06:48.920]  1776 is still new in history.
[11:06:48.920 --> 11:06:50.920]  It is not something old.
[11:06:50.920 --> 11:06:54.920]  The Bill of Rights enshrining our personal rights,
[11:06:54.920 --> 11:06:57.920]  our liberties, our right to free speech,
[11:06:57.920 --> 11:06:59.920]  our right to the Second Amendment,
[11:06:59.920 --> 11:07:01.920]  our right to the Fourth Amendment,
[11:07:01.920 --> 11:07:04.920]  which is being violated by TSA and so many other entities.
[11:07:04.920 --> 11:07:07.920]  That is all new to the slavery, to the tyranny
[11:07:07.920 --> 11:07:10.920]  that has been set in place for so long.
[11:07:10.920 --> 11:07:13.920]  And that's just one of many reasons we're in this fight
[11:07:13.920 --> 11:07:14.920]  and we're in it together.
[11:07:14.920 --> 11:07:16.920]  But we have to do it right now.
[11:07:16.920 --> 11:07:18.920]  This is that short window of time where we can fight back
[11:07:18.920 --> 11:07:20.920]  with the tools that are out there.
[11:07:20.920 --> 11:07:22.920]  Primarily, I mean technology.
[11:07:22.920 --> 11:07:24.920]  And we've gone through all the eugenics.
[11:07:24.920 --> 11:07:26.920]  We've shown the social engineering.
[11:07:26.920 --> 11:07:27.920]  I can get more into it later.
[11:07:27.920 --> 11:07:29.920]  I've just been going over this Israbe stuff.
[11:07:29.920 --> 11:07:33.920]  At the great links they've gone to not only tell us in their books
[11:07:33.920 --> 11:07:36.920]  what they think of us, how we're a separate species.
[11:07:36.920 --> 11:07:39.920]  That's to be dumbed down, to be taught false information.
[11:07:39.920 --> 11:07:41.920]  Allah, 1984.
[11:07:41.920 --> 11:07:44.920]  That really, they believe they are the future.
[11:07:44.920 --> 11:07:47.920]  Those few elites and their technocrats that work with them.
[11:07:47.920 --> 11:07:49.920]  And this is our only chance to fight back and say,
[11:07:49.920 --> 11:07:52.920]  no, we're human beings and we're going to be part of the future.
[11:07:52.920 --> 11:07:55.920]  And so that's the fight we're all part of.
[11:07:55.920 --> 11:07:57.920]  Dan, some of your closing comments,
[11:07:57.920 --> 11:08:00.920]  and then we have other stuff we're going to cover.
[11:08:00.920 --> 11:08:03.920]  Yeah, sure.
[11:08:03.920 --> 11:08:06.920]  You know, again, back to what we were talking about,
[11:08:06.920 --> 11:08:11.920]  what Alex, one of the awesome things that he does
[11:08:11.920 --> 11:08:16.920]  is he inspires others out there to follow his example
[11:08:16.920 --> 11:08:18.920]  and do similar things.
[11:08:18.920 --> 11:08:21.920]  And there's no doubt that he has been integral
[11:08:21.920 --> 11:08:24.920]  to my entire awakening process
[11:08:24.920 --> 11:08:31.920]  and has, you know, the whole direction of my life.
[11:08:31.920 --> 11:08:34.920]  He's certainly been an influence on that.
[11:08:34.920 --> 11:08:36.920]  And I thank you guys for that.
[11:08:36.920 --> 11:08:39.920]  And I have constantly been trying to pick up my efforts.
[11:08:39.920 --> 11:08:41.920]  Ever since 2005, 2006,
[11:08:41.920 --> 11:08:44.920]  trying to figure out ways to reach more people
[11:08:44.920 --> 11:08:47.920]  and to do this better and just get better at it.
[11:08:47.920 --> 11:08:49.920]  Again, I dove in head first,
[11:08:49.920 --> 11:08:51.920]  not really knowing what I'm doing,
[11:08:51.920 --> 11:08:54.920]  and I'm just trying to do my best.
[11:08:54.920 --> 11:08:56.920]  And I'm getting to a point now
[11:08:56.920 --> 11:08:59.920]  where I want to take it to a next level as well.
[11:08:59.920 --> 11:09:02.920]  So I'm working on a new website
[11:09:02.920 --> 11:09:04.920]  that I would hope that people would check out.
[11:09:04.920 --> 11:09:06.920]  I'm hoping to launch this thing
[11:09:06.920 --> 11:09:10.920]  in the first day of 2012, in January 1st.
[11:09:10.920 --> 11:09:12.920]  And it's going to be PressForTruth.tv.
[11:09:12.920 --> 11:09:15.920]  And if people like what I'm doing, you like my work,
[11:09:15.920 --> 11:09:17.920]  you want to support what I'm doing,
[11:09:17.920 --> 11:09:19.920]  please go check out PressForTruth.tv.
[11:09:19.920 --> 11:09:23.920]  It's not going to be ready for another until January.
[11:09:23.920 --> 11:09:27.920]  But this is another way that I'm going to be able to do this work.
[11:09:27.920 --> 11:09:29.920]  This very, very important work.
[11:09:29.920 --> 11:09:32.920]  And just continue to spread this information.
[11:09:32.920 --> 11:09:34.920]  And of course, we've said this already,
[11:09:34.920 --> 11:09:36.920]  but we do have to support each other.
[11:09:36.920 --> 11:09:38.920]  I mean, just look at all the things,
[11:09:38.920 --> 11:09:41.920]  the Rockefeller, the Gates Foundation,
[11:09:41.920 --> 11:09:43.920]  the Carnegie Foundation have done
[11:09:43.920 --> 11:09:46.920]  to literally steer entire education movements,
[11:09:46.920 --> 11:09:49.920]  entire developments of science and technology,
[11:09:49.920 --> 11:09:51.920]  which direction the research is going,
[11:09:51.920 --> 11:09:53.920]  where the global agreements are going,
[11:09:53.920 --> 11:09:56.920]  how the United Nations and its related entities
[11:09:56.920 --> 11:09:59.920]  and organs develop and come out of the darkness
[11:09:59.920 --> 11:10:02.920]  into dominance they've tried to establish.
[11:10:02.920 --> 11:10:05.920]  It's all coordinated through their central funding.
[11:10:05.920 --> 11:10:07.920]  They've paid money to try to destroy records.
[11:10:07.920 --> 11:10:09.920]  Israbe talks about this.
[11:10:09.920 --> 11:10:11.920]  None of the video will be playing later,
[11:10:11.920 --> 11:10:13.920]  but in other parts, I think in part one,
[11:10:13.920 --> 11:10:15.920]  how they tried to buy up and destroy
[11:10:15.920 --> 11:10:17.920]  the only copies of the hearings
[11:10:17.920 --> 11:10:20.920]  on the role of foundations in our country,
[11:10:20.920 --> 11:10:23.920]  something that the people were not supposed to be allowed to know about.
[11:10:23.920 --> 11:10:26.920]  We have helped bring you that information along with other researchers.
[11:10:26.920 --> 11:10:29.920]  This too, Dan, because I know you were at that 2006
[11:10:29.920 --> 11:10:31.920]  Bilderberg meeting.
[11:10:31.920 --> 11:10:33.920]  Something really I haven't heard people talk about.
[11:10:33.920 --> 11:10:36.920]  Now, Alex and others have really helped bring out
[11:10:36.920 --> 11:10:38.920]  how the left-right paradigm is false,
[11:10:38.920 --> 11:10:40.920]  how the Federal Reserve and other entities
[11:10:40.920 --> 11:10:42.920]  are so central to what's going on
[11:10:42.920 --> 11:10:45.920]  and how it's really this big cartel meeting
[11:10:45.920 --> 11:10:47.920]  of people on all sides of the spectrum
[11:10:47.920 --> 11:10:49.920]  working and coordinating together,
[11:10:49.920 --> 11:10:52.920]  even though they seem to be individual and separate
[11:10:52.920 --> 11:10:54.920]  outside of that.
[11:10:54.920 --> 11:10:57.920]  I know in 2006, we got information out of the meeting
[11:10:57.920 --> 11:10:59.920]  and it's in the in-game film
[11:10:59.920 --> 11:11:02.920]  about how they're planning to pop the housing bubble.
[11:11:02.920 --> 11:11:04.920]  Nobody knew that then. Nobody knew
[11:11:04.920 --> 11:11:06.920]  they were going to pop the housing bubble.
[11:11:06.920 --> 11:11:08.920]  In 2006, InfoWars, Alex Jones
[11:11:08.920 --> 11:11:10.920]  brought you that information.
[11:11:10.920 --> 11:11:12.920]  So many other researchers, Jim Tucker
[11:11:12.920 --> 11:11:15.920]  and the others, and look what happened.
[11:11:15.920 --> 11:11:17.920]  It didn't happen until 2008,
[11:11:17.920 --> 11:11:19.920]  but it was totally true, Dan Dix.
[11:11:19.920 --> 11:11:21.920]  Yeah, absolutely.
[11:11:21.920 --> 11:11:23.920]  I think a lot of people now are realizing
[11:11:23.920 --> 11:11:26.920]  because of that, that getting out of debt
[11:11:26.920 --> 11:11:29.920]  is absolutely crucial.
[11:11:29.920 --> 11:11:31.920]  When you have multiple credit cards
[11:11:31.920 --> 11:11:34.920]  and a line of credit and mortgages
[11:11:34.920 --> 11:11:36.920]  and loans and all these things,
[11:11:36.920 --> 11:11:39.920]  the global elite literally have their
[11:11:39.920 --> 11:11:42.920]  bony little fingers wrapped around your neck
[11:11:42.920 --> 11:11:45.920]  and they can squeeze at just about any time.
[11:11:45.920 --> 11:11:49.920]  So getting out of debt is absolutely crucial.
[11:11:49.920 --> 11:11:51.920]  It is easier said than done.
[11:11:51.920 --> 11:11:55.920]  I mean, we are all born into this debt-based system
[11:11:55.920 --> 11:11:58.920]  and a lot of the times it might even mean
[11:11:58.920 --> 11:12:02.920]  lowering your standards of living
[11:12:02.920 --> 11:12:05.920]  so that you can own something outright.
[11:12:05.920 --> 11:12:07.920]  But I think that's one of the areas
[11:12:07.920 --> 11:12:10.920]  that people need to focus on in their own lives
[11:12:10.920 --> 11:12:12.920]  because you've got to change yourself
[11:12:12.920 --> 11:12:14.920]  before you change the world.
[11:12:14.920 --> 11:12:18.920]  And I think getting out of debt is absolutely crucial
[11:12:18.920 --> 11:12:22.920]  to taking the right steps in the right direction
[11:12:22.920 --> 11:12:25.920]  in regards to fighting the New World Order.
[11:12:25.920 --> 11:12:26.920]  I agree.
[11:12:26.920 --> 11:12:28.920]  And of course, trying to live within your means
[11:12:28.920 --> 11:12:30.920]  is a good start too, particularly for people
[11:12:30.920 --> 11:12:32.920]  who don't have extra means.
[11:12:32.920 --> 11:12:34.920]  And of course, these credit cards and everything
[11:12:34.920 --> 11:12:35.920]  are very predatory.
[11:12:35.920 --> 11:12:37.920]  I think the other side of that same coin
[11:12:37.920 --> 11:12:40.920]  is trying to build an independent life,
[11:12:40.920 --> 11:12:42.920]  trying to detach from a system,
[11:12:42.920 --> 11:12:44.920]  especially in the areas where it's predatory
[11:12:44.920 --> 11:12:46.920]  and that is so many of those areas.
[11:12:46.920 --> 11:12:48.920]  And I think a lot of that web,
[11:12:48.920 --> 11:12:50.920]  try to build your own personal assets.
[11:12:50.920 --> 11:12:52.920]  I haven't been able to do it all myself,
[11:12:52.920 --> 11:12:55.920]  but I know what direction I'd like to be able to go.
[11:12:55.920 --> 11:12:58.920]  I know there are people who grow their own food
[11:12:58.920 --> 11:13:00.920]  and so forth and so on.
[11:13:00.920 --> 11:13:02.920]  I think that's an important part of it as well.
[11:13:02.920 --> 11:13:04.920]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[11:13:04.920 --> 11:13:07.920]  And just closing up comments,
[11:13:07.920 --> 11:13:10.920]  I was listening to a few of the guests earlier.
[11:13:10.920 --> 11:13:13.920]  There's been so many awesome guests on today.
[11:13:13.920 --> 11:13:17.920]  I believe what a lot of the other ones were saying
[11:13:17.920 --> 11:13:20.920]  is that this is indeed, when you look at it,
[11:13:20.920 --> 11:13:22.920]  you get into the crux of it.
[11:13:22.920 --> 11:13:25.920]  We're involved with spiritual warfare here.
[11:13:25.920 --> 11:13:28.920]  And I think one of the crucial things
[11:13:28.920 --> 11:13:30.920]  is to get right with God as well.
[11:13:30.920 --> 11:13:35.920]  I think mankind, having turned their backs
[11:13:35.920 --> 11:13:38.920]  on God pretty much is also a part of the reason
[11:13:38.920 --> 11:13:41.920]  why we're in the situation that we are in.
[11:13:41.920 --> 11:13:45.920]  So I am in total agreeance with a lot of the previous guests
[11:13:45.920 --> 11:13:46.920]  in that regards.
[11:13:46.920 --> 11:13:49.920]  I think that is one of these solutions
[11:13:49.920 --> 11:13:52.920]  that people need to focus on as well.
[11:13:52.920 --> 11:13:54.920]  Yeah, it's really incredible too.
[11:13:54.920 --> 11:13:56.920]  And when everybody comes on at once,
[11:13:56.920 --> 11:13:59.920]  it becomes this big flow of energy and consciousness.
[11:13:59.920 --> 11:14:01.920]  And I think everybody's thinking off of each other too.
[11:14:01.920 --> 11:14:03.920]  So that's just another great thing
[11:14:03.920 --> 11:14:06.920]  about this kind of long marathon broadcast.
[11:14:06.920 --> 11:14:08.920]  Well, thanks a lot for joining us, Dan.
[11:14:08.920 --> 11:14:12.920]  And I hope people will check out your work at Press4Truth.ca, right?
[11:14:12.920 --> 11:14:13.920]  Yeah, that's right.
[11:14:13.920 --> 11:14:14.920]  Okay, thanks, guys.
[11:14:14.920 --> 11:14:17.920]  Keep up the great work and good luck with the rest of it.
[11:14:17.920 --> 11:14:18.920]  Great. Have a good night.
[11:14:18.920 --> 11:14:19.920]  Thanks.
[11:14:19.920 --> 11:14:21.920]  And we again do want to thank all the people
[11:14:21.920 --> 11:14:23.920]  who've supported us monetarily,
[11:14:23.920 --> 11:14:26.920]  but of course also those who've shared the link,
[11:14:26.920 --> 11:14:27.920]  who've spread the word,
[11:14:27.920 --> 11:14:30.920]  who've simply told people about the Infowars broadcast,
[11:14:30.920 --> 11:14:33.920]  who've tried to turn people on to alternative information.
[11:14:33.920 --> 11:14:35.920]  It's not just our own personal lives
[11:14:35.920 --> 11:14:37.920]  that we have to detach from the system
[11:14:37.920 --> 11:14:39.920]  and build up our own areas,
[11:14:39.920 --> 11:14:45.920]  but we need to build up good alternative sources of information,
[11:14:45.920 --> 11:14:48.920]  try to make places like Infowars.com
[11:14:48.920 --> 11:14:51.920]  really a buoyant kind of lifting area,
[11:14:51.920 --> 11:14:54.920]  and then other people coming along with it as well,
[11:14:54.920 --> 11:14:56.920]  going in their own directions,
[11:14:56.920 --> 11:15:00.920]  really raising all ships, trying to raise all tides.
[11:15:00.920 --> 11:15:03.920]  I don't think that phrase is coming out the way I planned it.
[11:15:03.920 --> 11:15:04.920]  But I've got a lot of notes here.
[11:15:04.920 --> 11:15:07.920]  It'd be hard to go through it in detail,
[11:15:07.920 --> 11:15:09.920]  but so many of the people we consider eugenicists,
[11:15:09.920 --> 11:15:11.920]  whether it's the Huxley family,
[11:15:11.920 --> 11:15:12.920]  Aldous Huxley,
[11:15:12.920 --> 11:15:14.920]  and his brother Julian Huxley,
[11:15:14.920 --> 11:15:15.920]  who ran UNESCO,
[11:15:15.920 --> 11:15:17.920]  the Rockefeller family,
[11:15:17.920 --> 11:15:18.920]  the Harriman's family,
[11:15:18.920 --> 11:15:21.920]  not only do they build up so many of our enemies
[11:15:21.920 --> 11:15:22.920]  at World War II,
[11:15:22.920 --> 11:15:23.920]  like Nazi Germany,
[11:15:23.920 --> 11:15:25.920]  build up Soviet Russia,
[11:15:25.920 --> 11:15:26.920]  finance them and build them up
[11:15:26.920 --> 11:15:29.920]  as this Hegelian dialectic false enemy.
[11:15:29.920 --> 11:15:32.920]  They've also totally socially engineered us.
[11:15:32.920 --> 11:15:35.920]  They've not only laid the claim that they could decide
[11:15:35.920 --> 11:15:37.920]  how many people will live or die
[11:15:37.920 --> 11:15:41.920]  and try to exercise control over that.
[11:15:41.920 --> 11:15:44.920]  They have tried to physiochemically control
[11:15:44.920 --> 11:15:46.920]  the way we think,
[11:15:46.920 --> 11:15:48.920]  the kind of inputs we have.
[11:15:48.920 --> 11:15:50.920]  And you see that just for instance
[11:15:50.920 --> 11:15:52.920]  through the Rockefeller Foundation
[11:15:52.920 --> 11:15:54.920]  at places like Caltech
[11:15:54.920 --> 11:15:56.920]  and other important research centers.
[11:15:56.920 --> 11:15:57.920]  I have that book here,
[11:15:57.920 --> 11:15:58.920]  The Molecular Vision of Life.
[11:15:58.920 --> 11:16:00.920]  It's one of the ones I've covered.
[11:16:00.920 --> 11:16:01.920]  And it's just incredible.
[11:16:01.920 --> 11:16:03.920]  They list here on page 46
[11:16:03.920 --> 11:16:06.920]  how they want to control psychobiology,
[11:16:06.920 --> 11:16:08.920]  internal secretions, nutrition,
[11:16:08.920 --> 11:16:10.920]  that's vitamins and so forth,
[11:16:10.920 --> 11:16:13.920]  radiation, biology of sex, experimentation,
[11:16:13.920 --> 11:16:15.920]  chemical embryology, genetics,
[11:16:15.920 --> 11:16:17.920]  general physiology, biophysics.
[11:16:17.920 --> 11:16:20.920]  They're really trying to game our lives
[11:16:20.920 --> 11:16:23.920]  and control it all through the essentially steered,
[11:16:23.920 --> 11:16:24.920]  privately controlled,
[11:16:24.920 --> 11:16:27.920]  but publicly influenced operations.
[11:16:27.920 --> 11:16:29.920]  And they're really trying to subvert
[11:16:29.920 --> 11:16:31.920]  our humanity trying to dumb us down,
[11:16:31.920 --> 11:16:33.920]  dull us from what we are,
[11:16:33.920 --> 11:16:35.920]  get us caught up in making money,
[11:16:35.920 --> 11:16:37.920]  trying to make ends meet,
[11:16:37.920 --> 11:16:39.920]  the things we watch on television
[11:16:39.920 --> 11:16:40.920]  and the rest of it,
[11:16:40.920 --> 11:16:42.920]  and keep us from that higher state of mind,
[11:16:42.920 --> 11:16:44.920]  the things that we're trying to get into
[11:16:44.920 --> 11:16:45.920]  and thoughts.
[11:16:45.920 --> 11:16:47.920]  And it's just another direction we have to go.
[11:16:47.920 --> 11:16:49.920]  Now, I know we have another guest
[11:16:49.920 --> 11:16:50.920]  coming up in a few minutes.
[11:16:50.920 --> 11:16:52.920]  He's going to update us on the Occupy movement.
[11:16:52.920 --> 11:16:54.920]  He's here in Dallas,
[11:16:54.920 --> 11:16:56.920]  here in Texas rather,
[11:16:56.920 --> 11:16:58.920]  locally in Dallas at the Occupy.
[11:16:58.920 --> 11:17:00.920]  Federal Reserve movement.
[11:17:00.920 --> 11:17:02.920]  And that is Rick Warden.
[11:17:02.920 --> 11:17:05.920]  But first, I think we should throw to a video.
[11:17:05.920 --> 11:17:07.920]  Hopefully they can get that ready.
[11:17:07.920 --> 11:17:10.920]  And I just want to remind you what it is ready.
[11:17:10.920 --> 11:17:13.920]  Yeah, we'll throw to that in just a second
[11:17:13.920 --> 11:17:15.920]  and remind you to donate at
[11:17:15.920 --> 11:17:17.920]  infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[11:17:17.920 --> 11:17:19.920]  You can also get the free video streams there.
[11:17:19.920 --> 11:17:22.920]  This broadcast is not just beginning,
[11:17:22.920 --> 11:17:24.920]  but it's far from over.
[11:17:24.920 --> 11:17:26.920]  It has well over eight hours to go.
[11:17:26.920 --> 11:17:28.920]  I think 11, all things told
[11:17:28.920 --> 11:17:30.920]  to the end of the next broadcast.
[11:17:30.920 --> 11:17:32.920]  And there's so much information.
[11:17:32.920 --> 11:17:33.920]  Archive these links.
[11:17:33.920 --> 11:17:35.920]  Capture the videos. Save them yourself.
[11:17:35.920 --> 11:17:36.920]  Put them on disk.
[11:17:36.920 --> 11:17:38.920]  Spread them to your friends and family.
[11:17:38.920 --> 11:17:40.920]  Let people know about this broadcast.
[11:17:40.920 --> 11:17:43.920]  And of course, help us monetarily
[11:17:43.920 --> 11:17:45.920]  if you don't donate money directly.
[11:17:45.920 --> 11:17:48.920]  Help buy the products and buy from our sponsors.
[11:17:48.920 --> 11:17:50.920]  There's a lot of good sponsors too
[11:17:50.920 --> 11:17:51.920]  that can improve your lives.
[11:17:51.920 --> 11:17:54.920]  I've tried to check out a lot of the nutritional ones
[11:17:54.920 --> 11:17:56.920]  and had some improvements in those ways
[11:17:56.920 --> 11:17:58.920]  just on my own.
[11:17:58.920 --> 11:18:00.920]  But it's important that you help this operation
[11:18:00.920 --> 11:18:03.920]  and help us grow in so many ways.
[11:18:03.920 --> 11:18:05.920]  And of course, the things you buy
[11:18:05.920 --> 11:18:07.920]  and spread the words about themselves
[11:18:07.920 --> 11:18:10.920]  become a way to get the word out more.
[11:18:10.920 --> 11:18:12.920]  Well, you know what I'm trying to say.
[11:18:12.920 --> 11:18:14.920]  And we really appreciate those who've helped us.
[11:18:14.920 --> 11:18:16.920]  Let's go to a video right now.
[11:18:16.920 --> 11:18:18.920]  My friends, please pay attention
[11:18:18.920 --> 11:18:20.920]  to the information I'm about to cover
[11:18:20.920 --> 11:18:23.920]  and research the links that we'll post below this video
[11:18:23.920 --> 11:18:25.920]  so that you understand none of this is my opinion.
[11:18:25.920 --> 11:18:27.920]  It is fact.
[11:18:27.920 --> 11:18:29.920]  This issue is the most important issue
[11:18:29.920 --> 11:18:31.920]  going on in the world.
[11:18:31.920 --> 11:18:33.920]  It is scientific tyranny.
[11:18:33.920 --> 11:18:35.920]  I've read literally hundreds of government white papers
[11:18:35.920 --> 11:18:37.920]  and documents and books like Ecoscience
[11:18:37.920 --> 11:18:39.920]  where the White House Science are
[11:18:39.920 --> 11:18:41.920]  and talks about the history of science
[11:18:41.920 --> 11:18:43.920]  and the history of science.
[11:18:43.920 --> 11:18:46.920]  And books like Ecoscience where the White House Science are
[11:18:46.920 --> 11:18:48.920]  talks about forcibly drugging the water
[11:18:48.920 --> 11:18:50.920]  to dumb you down and sterilize you.
[11:18:50.920 --> 11:18:53.920]  But now, they're in the New York Times
[11:18:53.920 --> 11:18:55.920]  and Time Magazine and everywhere
[11:18:55.920 --> 11:18:57.920]  and all the major medical journals
[11:18:57.920 --> 11:19:00.920]  promoting not only drugging the water with lithium,
[11:19:00.920 --> 11:19:02.920]  which by the way they're already doing,
[11:19:02.920 --> 11:19:05.920]  but now they're announcing it to make you servile,
[11:19:05.920 --> 11:19:08.920]  but now they are admitting that they plan to deploy
[11:19:08.920 --> 11:19:10.920]  something I learned about a decade ago.
[11:19:10.920 --> 11:19:13.920]  Hundreds of different vaccines.
[11:19:13.920 --> 11:19:18.920]  They're really biological re-engineering live viruses
[11:19:18.920 --> 11:19:21.920]  that they inject into your body
[11:19:21.920 --> 11:19:27.920]  and the live viruses go in and attack your brain.
[11:19:27.920 --> 11:19:30.920]  And they claim, oh, it's to stop drug addiction.
[11:19:30.920 --> 11:19:34.920]  Those same receptor sites that pick up opiates
[11:19:34.920 --> 11:19:37.920]  and nicotine and alcohol pick up your normal endorphins.
[11:19:37.920 --> 11:19:40.920]  It's part of being a normal human being.
[11:19:40.920 --> 11:19:43.920]  Those drugs mimic that and the viruses attack
[11:19:43.920 --> 11:19:47.920]  those receptor sites and kill them and create dead tissue.
[11:19:47.920 --> 11:19:53.920]  It is a vaccine-induced live virus lobotomy.
[11:19:53.920 --> 11:19:56.920]  Now, they're coming out and saying the American people
[11:19:56.920 --> 11:19:58.920]  and the people of the world are sick
[11:19:58.920 --> 11:20:00.920]  and major medical journals are saying,
[11:20:00.920 --> 11:20:02.920]  we need to give everybody these shots
[11:20:02.920 --> 11:20:05.920]  to make them feel better, to stop having anxiety,
[11:20:05.920 --> 11:20:07.920]  to stop being angry.
[11:20:07.920 --> 11:20:11.920]  In other words, to take away your instinct
[11:20:11.920 --> 11:20:15.920]  for self-preservation, your will to survive,
[11:20:15.920 --> 11:20:18.920]  to make you accept all the bad things that are happening,
[11:20:18.920 --> 11:20:20.920]  to turn you into a biological android,
[11:20:20.920 --> 11:20:22.920]  a type of zombie.
[11:20:22.920 --> 11:20:25.920]  You cannot make this up.
[11:20:25.920 --> 11:20:27.920]  Please, send this video to everyone you know.
[11:20:27.920 --> 11:20:31.920]  For God's sakes, understand how serious this is.
[11:20:31.920 --> 11:20:35.920]  The global scientific corporate takeover of life itself.
[11:20:35.920 --> 11:20:37.920]  The globalists aren't just re-engineering corn and wheat
[11:20:37.920 --> 11:20:39.920]  and every other major crop
[11:20:39.920 --> 11:20:41.920]  and engineering sterilence into them.
[11:20:41.920 --> 11:20:43.920]  Suddenly, all over the news,
[11:20:43.920 --> 11:20:46.920]  they're promoting lithium and Prozac
[11:20:46.920 --> 11:20:48.920]  and other drugs in the water.
[11:20:48.920 --> 11:20:50.920]  Head bioethicists at Cambridge,
[11:20:50.920 --> 11:20:52.920]  they're the people that advise
[11:20:52.920 --> 11:20:54.920]  and set medical policy for doctors,
[11:20:54.920 --> 11:20:56.920]  are announcing they want to force drug you
[11:20:56.920 --> 11:20:59.920]  and they're calling it cognitive enhancement.
[11:20:59.920 --> 11:21:01.920]  I've got a CBS news piece
[11:21:01.920 --> 11:21:04.920]  where they say that mercury helps your intelligence.
[11:21:04.920 --> 11:21:06.920]  What everyone knows, it causes brain damage.
[11:21:06.920 --> 11:21:09.920]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids
[11:21:09.920 --> 11:21:12.920]  according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[11:21:12.920 --> 11:21:15.920]  So when they say cognitive enhancement,
[11:21:15.920 --> 11:21:18.920]  they mean cognitive brain damage.
[11:21:18.920 --> 11:21:20.920]  They mean taking your essence,
[11:21:20.920 --> 11:21:23.920]  literally your psyche, who you are away.
[11:21:23.920 --> 11:21:25.920]  And they sit up there saying,
[11:21:25.920 --> 11:21:29.920]  well, if we put Prozac in the water, it'll cut suicide.
[11:21:29.920 --> 11:21:31.920]  When it's admitted that Prozac on its insert
[11:21:31.920 --> 11:21:33.920]  can cause suicide,
[11:21:33.920 --> 11:21:35.920]  I have mainstream news articles
[11:21:35.920 --> 11:21:37.920]  that have just come out in the last few days in England
[11:21:37.920 --> 11:21:40.920]  where people have a tenfold increase in convulsions
[11:21:40.920 --> 11:21:43.920]  and they develop epilepsy after the flu shot.
[11:21:43.920 --> 11:21:45.920]  I talked to top scientists
[11:21:45.920 --> 11:21:47.920]  who studied the flu shot last year
[11:21:47.920 --> 11:21:50.920]  and found bizarre viral RNA in it
[11:21:50.920 --> 11:21:52.920]  that deals with the brain.
[11:21:52.920 --> 11:21:55.920]  I've had top brain surgeons on like Dr. Russell Blalock
[11:21:55.920 --> 11:21:58.920]  to talk about this and the government documents that he's read
[11:21:58.920 --> 11:22:01.920]  how this is part of a eugenics population control program.
[11:22:01.920 --> 11:22:03.920]  I mean, here it is.
[11:22:03.920 --> 11:22:07.920]  London Telegraph, flu jab linked to fits and under fives.
[11:22:07.920 --> 11:22:09.920]  And it goes on to say they've been told not to give children
[11:22:09.920 --> 11:22:11.920]  110,000 in England or five the shot
[11:22:11.920 --> 11:22:16.920]  because they had convulsions at ten times the regular rate.
[11:22:16.920 --> 11:22:19.920]  Lindsay Lohan isn't what matters.
[11:22:19.920 --> 11:22:21.920]  Mel Gibson isn't what matters.
[11:22:21.920 --> 11:22:23.920]  The depression doesn't even matter.
[11:22:23.920 --> 11:22:25.920]  War with Iran is not even that important
[11:22:25.920 --> 11:22:28.920]  compared to a medical dictatorship
[11:22:28.920 --> 11:22:31.920]  and under the National Health Service in England
[11:22:31.920 --> 11:22:33.920]  and now National Healthcare here in the U.S.
[11:22:33.920 --> 11:22:36.920]  they're slashing regular healthcare like cancer surgery
[11:22:36.920 --> 11:22:38.920]  or having a broken leg fixed
[11:22:38.920 --> 11:22:40.920]  and converting it over to psychiatry
[11:22:40.920 --> 11:22:44.920]  and this biological warfare or biopsychiatry
[11:22:44.920 --> 11:22:46.920]  where they say don't worry about drugs anymore
[11:22:46.920 --> 11:22:47.920]  for your depression.
[11:22:47.920 --> 11:22:50.920]  We're going to give you a shot that alters your brain
[11:22:50.920 --> 11:22:54.920]  by viruses literally attacking your brain
[11:22:54.920 --> 11:22:57.920]  and they're rolling it out in public trials
[11:22:57.920 --> 11:23:00.920]  over 100 of these vaccines right now
[11:23:00.920 --> 11:23:03.920]  and they're clearly spiking other vaccines with it.
[11:23:03.920 --> 11:23:06.920]  If you love your children, if you love your family
[11:23:06.920 --> 11:23:09.920]  you've got to realize this is a creeping scientific
[11:23:09.920 --> 11:23:12.920]  incremental soft kill system.
[11:23:12.920 --> 11:23:14.920]  Let's go over some of these articles.
[11:23:14.920 --> 11:23:17.920]  Jab that could put a stop to stress
[11:23:17.920 --> 11:23:19.920]  without slowing us down
[11:23:19.920 --> 11:23:21.920]  and it says they're going to make humans better.
[11:23:21.920 --> 11:23:24.920]  They've re-engineered potatoes and corn.
[11:23:24.920 --> 11:23:26.920]  Why not just re-engineered humans?
[11:23:26.920 --> 11:23:30.920]  And they quote all these major medical journals
[11:23:30.920 --> 11:23:32.920]  saying how great it is
[11:23:32.920 --> 11:23:36.920]  and they say this could change society, the professor said.
[11:23:36.920 --> 11:23:38.920]  And they have a government funded Stanford team
[11:23:38.920 --> 11:23:42.920]  with these neuroprotective viruses
[11:23:42.920 --> 11:23:45.920]  and this particular vaccine, one of hundreds
[11:23:45.920 --> 11:23:48.920]  is a live herpes virus
[11:23:48.920 --> 11:23:53.920]  engineered to only eat certain key brain tissue.
[11:23:53.920 --> 11:23:55.920]  What's wrong?
[11:23:55.920 --> 11:23:56.920]  Nothing really.
[11:23:56.920 --> 11:23:59.920]  I just feel that I need something stronger.
[11:23:59.920 --> 11:24:03.920]  If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
[11:24:03.920 --> 11:24:05.920]  Yes, thank you, I'll be alright.
[11:24:05.920 --> 11:24:06.920]  Call 348.
[11:24:06.920 --> 11:24:07.920]  They're not asking you.
[11:24:07.920 --> 11:24:09.920]  They're just rolling it out.
[11:24:09.920 --> 11:24:12.920]  And this isn't like some drug that they give people
[11:24:12.920 --> 11:24:14.920]  for a decade that causes hundreds of thousands of women
[11:24:14.920 --> 11:24:16.920]  to have deformed children.
[11:24:16.920 --> 11:24:18.920]  This isn't some drug that just makes one person
[11:24:18.920 --> 11:24:20.920]  have a heart attack.
[11:24:20.920 --> 11:24:23.920]  All these other recall drugs, these aren't even drugs.
[11:24:23.920 --> 11:24:27.920]  These are genetically engineered nanotech viruses
[11:24:27.920 --> 11:24:32.920]  that go in and turn you into a servile biological android.
[11:24:32.920 --> 11:24:34.920]  Do you understand?
[11:24:34.920 --> 11:24:36.920]  The vaccines that they're rolling out
[11:24:36.920 --> 11:24:42.920]  are live virus bio weapons that re-engineer your brain.
[11:24:42.920 --> 11:24:46.920]  You've seen the reports where all over the world, Asia,
[11:24:46.920 --> 11:24:49.920]  Africa, Latin America, Central Asia,
[11:24:49.920 --> 11:24:53.920]  they give children UN sanctioned polio shots
[11:24:53.920 --> 11:24:57.920]  and the children come down with weaponized polio and die.
[11:24:57.920 --> 11:25:00.920]  And the government admits, oh, it was an accident with that vaccine.
[11:25:00.920 --> 11:25:02.920]  People are now waking up to the fact that
[11:25:02.920 --> 11:25:05.920]  the vaccines are causing convulsions and brain damage and cancer.
[11:25:05.920 --> 11:25:07.920]  And so what's their answer?
[11:25:07.920 --> 11:25:09.920]  They're coming out and saying, don't worry,
[11:25:09.920 --> 11:25:12.920]  if you have a shot, have a banana.
[11:25:12.920 --> 11:25:13.920]  They're coming out.
[11:25:13.920 --> 11:25:18.920]  Nobel laureate scientist defines future vaccines as food.
[11:25:18.920 --> 11:25:22.920]  They're pharmacological crops that grow the live virus,
[11:25:22.920 --> 11:25:25.920]  whether it gives you cancer or gives you polio
[11:25:25.920 --> 11:25:29.920]  or literally sends viruses in to eat parts of your brain.
[11:25:29.920 --> 11:25:31.920]  It's all being done.
[11:25:31.920 --> 11:25:34.920]  Bill Gates is coming out with a biologically engineered mosquito
[11:25:34.920 --> 11:25:37.920]  to forcibly deliver vaccines to you.
[11:25:37.920 --> 11:25:39.920]  There's new drug discovery going on.
[11:25:39.920 --> 11:25:41.920]  Our foundation is back to vaccine
[11:25:41.920 --> 11:25:44.920]  that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months.
[11:25:44.920 --> 11:25:48.920]  And that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective.
[11:25:48.920 --> 11:25:51.920]  And most sickeningly, over and over again, they claim,
[11:25:51.920 --> 11:25:53.920]  oh, it's to make you not depressed anymore.
[11:25:53.920 --> 11:25:54.920]  All of you have problems.
[11:25:54.920 --> 11:25:56.920]  You shouldn't be upset about things.
[11:25:56.920 --> 11:25:58.920]  No, we're meant to get upset at a biological level
[11:25:58.920 --> 11:26:00.920]  and say no to this tyranny.
[11:26:00.920 --> 11:26:03.920]  And so they're coming out saying, oh, we're going to re-engineer
[11:26:03.920 --> 11:26:05.920]  your brain, cognitive enhancements.
[11:26:05.920 --> 11:26:07.920]  We're going to help you.
[11:26:07.920 --> 11:26:11.920]  The mercury's helping your brain on newscasts all over the country.
[11:26:11.920 --> 11:26:14.920]  Oh, the convulsions are helping you.
[11:26:14.920 --> 11:26:18.920]  Oh, lithium, a toxic metal that they want to put in the water.
[11:26:18.920 --> 11:26:20.920]  It's helping you.
[11:26:20.920 --> 11:26:23.920]  You're going to feel much better after all of this is done.
[11:26:23.920 --> 11:26:26.920]  What's wrong?
[11:26:26.920 --> 11:26:28.920]  Never mind.
[11:26:28.920 --> 11:26:30.920]  They're not coming for us.
[11:26:30.920 --> 11:26:31.920]  They're already here.
[11:26:31.920 --> 11:26:33.920]  We're in danger.
[11:26:33.920 --> 11:26:36.920]  They're coming for you, who have a child who seems to be dumbed down
[11:26:36.920 --> 11:26:38.920]  and isn't as smart as anybody else in your family.
[11:26:38.920 --> 11:26:40.920]  And something's wrong with them.
[11:26:40.920 --> 11:26:41.920]  It's the vaccines.
[11:26:41.920 --> 11:26:42.920]  It's the GMO food.
[11:26:42.920 --> 11:26:45.920]  Many of you who had an 18-month-old baby who was healthy and happy,
[11:26:45.920 --> 11:26:47.920]  they take that third round of shots.
[11:26:47.920 --> 11:26:50.920]  They have a convulsion that night, and they never talk again.
[11:26:50.920 --> 11:26:54.920]  They're turning you into servile minions who will do whatever you're told
[11:26:54.920 --> 11:26:57.920]  and who can't get angry and can't resist.
[11:26:57.920 --> 11:26:59.920]  Why do they want lithium in the water?
[11:26:59.920 --> 11:27:01.920]  They admit to make you submit.
[11:27:01.920 --> 11:27:03.920]  Lithium fluoride in all the studies do.
[11:27:03.920 --> 11:27:04.920]  Make you submit.
[11:27:04.920 --> 11:27:06.920]  And what do these vaccines do?
[11:27:06.920 --> 11:27:07.920]  They make you passive.
[11:27:07.920 --> 11:27:09.920]  They make you unable to get angry.
[11:27:09.920 --> 11:27:13.920]  Anger is a propulsion system to make you stand up for your species.
[11:27:13.920 --> 11:27:16.920]  This is a hostile corporate takeover, the very genetic code
[11:27:16.920 --> 11:27:19.920]  of not just the plants and animals, but humanity itself.
[11:27:19.920 --> 11:27:24.920]  It is the most diabolical covert operation ever seen.
[11:27:24.920 --> 11:27:28.920]  And now these people are out in the open.
[11:27:28.920 --> 11:27:29.920]  It's admitted.
[11:27:29.920 --> 11:27:30.920]  Do you understand?
[11:27:30.920 --> 11:27:31.920]  It's admitted.
[11:27:31.920 --> 11:27:36.920]  They want to make these shots mandatory in public schools to make you servile.
[11:27:36.920 --> 11:27:39.920]  Oh, but you don't want to become addicted to drugs.
[11:27:39.920 --> 11:27:40.920]  What do you think drugs mimic?
[11:27:40.920 --> 11:27:46.920]  They mimic natural chemicals in the brain that stir creativity and anger and love
[11:27:46.920 --> 11:27:48.920]  and everything else.
[11:27:48.920 --> 11:27:50.920]  It's those key receptors.
[11:27:50.920 --> 11:27:56.920]  They're literally going for the soul of man that is in the beautiful, detailed,
[11:27:56.920 --> 11:27:59.920]  complex computer that is the human mind.
[11:27:59.920 --> 11:28:03.920]  This is a hack against the human mind, a hack against the human soul,
[11:28:03.920 --> 11:28:05.920]  and we must stand up and resist it.
[11:28:05.920 --> 11:28:11.920]  They realize there's a worldwide revolt against this technocracy, against dehumanization.
[11:28:11.920 --> 11:28:16.920]  You need to become educated on these facts and join the resistance against this
[11:28:16.920 --> 11:28:18.920]  scientific dictatorship.
[11:28:18.920 --> 11:28:23.920]  Now is the time to realize that history is taking place right now,
[11:28:23.920 --> 11:28:28.920]  that we're living in the 21st century, and a scientific tyranny has taken over.
[11:28:28.920 --> 11:28:35.920]  If we are successful in defeating these people, historians will look back on this time
[11:28:35.920 --> 11:28:38.920]  as the greatest covert genocide in history.
[11:28:38.920 --> 11:28:44.920]  They will look back on it as the ultimate example of pure evil and corruption,
[11:28:44.920 --> 11:28:46.920]  this creeping death.
[11:28:46.920 --> 11:28:50.920]  Now I've warned the public and I will continue to detail what's happening.
[11:28:50.920 --> 11:28:53.920]  In areas where lithium and trace amounts is in the drinking water,
[11:28:53.920 --> 11:28:56.920]  there seems to be a lower level of suicidality,
[11:28:56.920 --> 11:29:00.920]  and in the Texas counties that we're studying, there's actually a lower crime rate.
[11:29:00.920 --> 11:29:04.920]  And how these enemies come out and talk in their simpering, lisping tones
[11:29:04.920 --> 11:29:11.920]  real softly to coax you and to advertise all this death and dehumanization as if it's good.
[11:29:11.920 --> 11:29:17.920]  The theory is that very low or trace amounts of lithium enhance connectivity between neurons,
[11:29:17.920 --> 11:29:22.920]  and doing that over the course of a lifetime, a lifetime exposure, makes the brain more healthy.
[11:29:22.920 --> 11:29:31.920]  Now I want to talk to the social engineers whose religion is a control freak system of dehumanization.
[11:29:31.920 --> 11:29:36.920]  You are like cancer, you're racing through the body politic, you think you're invincible,
[11:29:36.920 --> 11:29:42.920]  and you may kill the host, you may destroy our species, but not without a fight.
[11:29:42.920 --> 11:29:46.920]  You are disgusting, wicked people who love ruling over others.
[11:29:46.920 --> 11:29:50.920]  Everything you do creates death and destruction in its path.
[11:29:50.920 --> 11:29:54.920]  You sold Prozac as a way to stop depression when in your own trials,
[11:29:54.920 --> 11:29:56.920]  you knew it massively increased suicide.
[11:29:56.920 --> 11:30:03.920]  Now you're telling us how great lithium, a toxic metal, an anti-psychotic is going to be put in the water mandatory.
[11:30:03.920 --> 11:30:07.920]  We've got the studies, it's already in most of the water supplies, we know you're adding it.
[11:30:07.920 --> 11:30:10.920]  You are sickening, disgusting filth.
[11:30:10.920 --> 11:30:15.920]  And we're going to rally the world population against you, and we're going to bring you to justice.
[11:30:15.920 --> 11:30:20.920]  And I pray God that humanity makes it through what you've attempted to do,
[11:30:20.920 --> 11:30:27.920]  how you've saddled up next to us like a spider in the dark and tried to spin your webs of control around us while we were asleep.
[11:30:27.920 --> 11:30:32.920]  But the sleeping giant that is humanity is waking up to who you are and what you are.
[11:30:32.920 --> 11:30:40.920]  And I pray to the creator of the universe, and I beg for just the average person out there as well to research just who you are
[11:30:40.920 --> 11:30:46.920]  and how you're involved in a scorched earth takeover of society to secure your ill-gotten gains.
[11:30:46.920 --> 11:30:54.920]  And I want you to know that I'm going to do everything I can to rally free humanity against you and that we are going to defeat you.
[11:30:54.920 --> 11:31:00.920]  But whether we win or not, whether you lose or fail, at least we were real humans.
[11:31:00.920 --> 11:31:04.920]  We were good decent people that saw the truth and we stood up against you.
[11:31:04.920 --> 11:31:10.920]  And no matter what happens in this, you are still degenerate, dehumanizing filth.
[11:31:10.920 --> 11:31:19.920]  You are aberrant, malfunctioning trash, and you look at everything good and wholesome and tell us that we are malfunctioning.
[11:31:19.920 --> 11:31:30.920]  So I pray that you be defeated, but either way, in this time and space on this planet, good people stood up against what you are and did everything they could to help the innocence.
[11:31:30.920 --> 11:31:40.920]  When I look at all the children that you've brain damaged and all the children dying of cancer, and I look at all the things that you've done to humanity, it makes me want to vomit.
[11:31:40.920 --> 11:31:50.920]  You are doing this because this is only the next wave to first neutralize us so we're calm and sedate and can't resist so you can roll in with the hard-kill weapons.
[11:31:50.920 --> 11:31:53.920]  I know that. And I want to tell you something else.
[11:31:53.920 --> 11:32:01.920]  A lot of you that think that you're part of the winning team, you're going to find out that your masters hate you more than they even hate for humanity.
[11:32:01.920 --> 11:32:10.920]  Because they know that you know where the bodies are buried and they know you're a bunch of wicked control freaks that they need to kill first once they take over or you'll start trying to overthrow them.
[11:32:10.920 --> 11:32:17.920]  They understand your nature. They use their propaganda to manipulate good men throughout history to serve their evil aims.
[11:32:17.920 --> 11:32:28.920]  So understand this. You're going to fail one way or another. You've decided to put your soul on the side of darkness for all eternity for what you're doing to humanity and butchering our DNA.
[11:32:28.920 --> 11:32:34.920]  And literally mutating the human spirit and your control freak lust for power.
[11:32:34.920 --> 11:32:37.920]  And so all of you one way or another will fail.
[11:32:37.920 --> 11:32:44.920]  So all that matters is in this time and space, I stood up for what's right. I saw you clearly for what you are.
[11:32:44.920 --> 11:32:51.920]  And I know in my heart there's a very good chance we're going to beat you. But that's up to all the people out there watching this.
[11:32:51.920 --> 11:32:55.920]  Do they have the courage to face the facts? Do they have the courage to take action?
[11:32:55.920 --> 11:33:03.920]  If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-844 immediately.
[11:33:03.920 --> 11:33:14.920]  Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.
[11:33:39.920 --> 11:33:45.920]  We are back in the middle of this Info Wars money bomb marathon transmission.
[11:33:45.920 --> 11:33:50.920]  I'm Aaron Dykes. Alex will be back later in the morning. Paul Joseph Watson is coming up.
[11:33:50.920 --> 11:33:56.920]  Lots more special guests, other special videos. That was brain-eating vaccines.
[11:33:56.920 --> 11:34:06.920]  And true it is what Alex said that what matters is what we do in this time that we saw them for what they are in this time right here and right now.
[11:34:06.920 --> 11:34:10.920]  And this is a very, very important time in history if you don't realize it.
[11:34:10.920 --> 11:34:17.920]  There's been an entire continuity of how people never had information, never had access to the power of information.
[11:34:17.920 --> 11:34:24.920]  All these secret societies and occultic entities, the priest class, they were the ones who had the written information.
[11:34:24.920 --> 11:34:30.920]  The other continuity, did we just lose this transmit? We're still here.
[11:34:30.920 --> 11:34:38.920]  They held the information gradually and through various processes we've become able to get some of that information.
[11:34:38.920 --> 11:34:47.920]  What are we going to do with it while we have it? This is such an important time in history as we transition into this total technological information age.
[11:34:47.920 --> 11:34:59.920]  And you've seen the quotes of people like Bertrand Russell, one of the top globalist strategists, and he really predicted the mother of all tyrannies coming out of the scientific technological revolution.
[11:34:59.920 --> 11:35:08.920]  How it would allow a total dictatorship even greater than all the worst tyrannies you saw in the 20th century who killed millions and millions of people.
[11:35:08.920 --> 11:35:20.920]  But right now in this time with the power of the Internet, with our ability to read and write, and those of us who could still cogitate a thought even though it's in the middle of the night, 3.30 in the morning here,
[11:35:20.920 --> 11:35:29.920]  I can barely string a sentence, I'm still able to think and that is a revolution in its own right and we have to all get out there and use the energy we have.
[11:35:29.920 --> 11:35:37.920]  We do ask that you help support this operation, help us grow, help us reach more minds, unlock them and let them have the information too
[11:35:37.920 --> 11:35:46.920]  so we can hopefully reach a tipping point, stop this thing, transform whatever's coming in the future into something a little less tyrannical.
[11:35:46.920 --> 11:35:52.920]  If not outright when, back to the 1776 point in time where they enshrined individual liberties.
[11:35:52.920 --> 11:35:57.920]  The Bill of Rights is such an important moment in history as is the Constitution.
[11:35:57.920 --> 11:36:13.920]  Now on the other end of the Skype slash phone line we have Rick Warden, that's someone who is doing something in his time, he has continuously participated in Occupy the Fed movement within the larger Occupy movement
[11:36:13.920 --> 11:36:23.920]  trying to focus attention on the real enemy, one of the most central parts of the real enemy, the Federal Reserve private banking system that occupies us all.
[11:36:23.920 --> 11:36:27.920]  We're trying to reverse that and Occupy them and end their power.
[11:36:27.920 --> 11:36:32.920]  He's been in Dallas outside the Fed for some time now for weeks.
[11:36:32.920 --> 11:36:36.920]  Rick, are you there?
[11:36:36.920 --> 11:36:38.920]  It's good to be on.
[11:36:38.920 --> 11:36:44.920]  Rick, tell us what you've seen in recent weeks with Occupy and the direction it's going.
[11:36:44.920 --> 11:36:48.920]  With Occupy the Fed Dallas or Occupy movement period?
[11:36:48.920 --> 11:36:49.920]  Well both.
[11:36:49.920 --> 11:36:56.920]  Okay, well fantastic. I'll start with Occupy the Fed Dallas since that's where my real heart is.
[11:36:56.920 --> 11:37:07.920]  It's funny how I kind of positioned my whole life here in the last six months so that I could pursue my art, my music and my art.
[11:37:07.920 --> 11:37:16.920]  And so it left me with time to do this with Occupy the Fed Dallas and then now what I am doing involved with Occupy Dallas.
[11:37:16.920 --> 11:37:25.920]  So Occupy the Fed, this Saturday in the Fed, the official organization here, the local DFW chapter is Debbie McKee.
[11:37:25.920 --> 11:37:33.920]  They are throwing a rally or having a rally. It is Guy Fox Saturday, remember, remember, the 5th of November.
[11:37:33.920 --> 11:37:39.920]  And so we're going to have fun with our masks this Saturday at the Federal Reserve Bank.
[11:37:39.920 --> 11:37:47.920]  The in the Fed will be there from 10 in the morning till 12 noon, but several of us are going to stay all day and have a great time.
[11:37:47.920 --> 11:37:55.920]  So y'all coming out to the Fed in Dallas on North Pearl and Good Ladder.
[11:37:55.920 --> 11:38:02.920]  And for those who are not in the Texas area, there are Federal Reserve locations all across the country.
[11:38:02.920 --> 11:38:10.920]  There's 12 main branches in addition to the sort of central one in Washington DC, the Board of Governors location.
[11:38:10.920 --> 11:38:20.920]  And you can check the maps we posted before on Infowars.com. Dallas is the headquarters for kind of the Texas area and there's other ones throughout the country.
[11:38:20.920 --> 11:38:29.920]  Then there's other smaller branches. So almost every state would find one. I forget, but I think the number is something like 38 Federal Reserve locations.
[11:38:29.920 --> 11:38:35.920]  And so wherever you are, go to the Federal Reserve. It's not too late to remind them that we see that they're the real power.
[11:38:35.920 --> 11:38:41.920]  We know who's coordinated the latest and greatest depression going on here.
[11:38:41.920 --> 11:38:49.920]  And we know the Great Depression of the 1930s was also instigated by the Federal Reserve and its related powers.
[11:38:49.920 --> 11:39:03.920]  Among other things, they concentrated the money supply and really put the squeeze on a little plan they had to gear us into the collectivist models they had not only in the U.S. but throughout Europe and the rest of the world.
[11:39:03.920 --> 11:39:19.920]  Yeah, we were just watching, oh my goodness, I forget, we were watching a video at Occupy Dallas tonight that went over the Fed really well. It was the addendum to the series.
[11:39:19.920 --> 11:39:28.920]  Either way, basically you're correct. In 1913, these crooks took advantage and took control of the financial system in the United States of America.
[11:39:28.920 --> 11:39:39.920]  And they've used war, depression, and inflation to tax and rape and pillage the people now for what, almost 100 years.
[11:39:39.920 --> 11:39:48.920]  So it looks like their 100 year plan is coming to fruition. But you know, here's the great thing, is that there's good in all things, there's negative in all things as well.
[11:39:48.920 --> 11:39:53.920]  And you can have fun in the face of tyranny here in 2011.
[11:39:53.920 --> 11:39:58.920]  You can go out to the Federal Reserve Bank any day and I would encourage you to.
[11:39:58.920 --> 11:40:11.920]  But a time like Saturday where we're going to have a lot of people coming out and especially in your local city, if there is a Federal Reserve Bank, surely there's going to be people coming out enjoying Guy Fawkes Saturday.
[11:40:11.920 --> 11:40:18.920]  And even if you're a little intimidated and you don't really know all about this, you know, if you're compelled to go, go.
[11:40:18.920 --> 11:40:24.920]  You'll meet wonderful people. You'll make relationships that'll last a lifetime with like-minded people.
[11:40:24.920 --> 11:40:29.920]  And you'll be able to disseminate information. And that's what it's all about.
[11:40:29.920 --> 11:40:36.920]  Rick, what have you continued to see with the larger Occupy movement, not only there in Dallas, but what is the significance?
[11:40:36.920 --> 11:40:44.920]  You know, what is it two months later or at least several, several weeks later of this movement as it continues on one front or another?
[11:40:44.920 --> 11:40:53.920]  What is its overall significance? And the question I really think that goes with that, though, is do they have a global financial solution waiting?
[11:40:53.920 --> 11:40:58.920]  We know for years there's been talk of the dollar losing its reserve status.
[11:40:58.920 --> 11:41:03.920]  Do Soros and Company have a sort of new global standard waiting in the wings?
[11:41:03.920 --> 11:41:09.920]  Is that what their Bretton Woods II meeting was all about? What do you think about some of those topics?
[11:41:09.920 --> 11:41:16.920]  Well, obviously they have a global financial standard that they have in waiting that they're going to force everybody into.
[11:41:16.920 --> 11:41:22.920]  That's obviously the, you know, the answer to this global crisis as a global currency.
[11:41:22.920 --> 11:41:33.920]  And surely backed with, you know, a global, more global governance, more security on our behalf, more invasion into our privacy.
[11:41:33.920 --> 11:41:44.920]  It doesn't seem like that would be possible, but that's obviously their plan is they want more control and they'll get that through this new global currency if they have their way.
[11:41:44.920 --> 11:41:51.920]  Now back to the Occupy Dallas, though, or the Occupy movement, you know, it's really interesting.
[11:41:51.920 --> 11:41:58.920]  I would like to first and foremost encourage people just to think, you know, chill for a little bit and think about what's going on.
[11:41:58.920 --> 11:42:04.920]  Any movement that has ever existed has had all kinds of sides to it.
[11:42:04.920 --> 11:42:11.920]  One of the issues that we have at Occupy Dallas right now, I do media and I believe in independent media.
[11:42:11.920 --> 11:42:23.920]  Well, they have a need to have a lot of their media censored, if you will, or go through the Occupy Dallas group so that it reflects upon Occupy Dallas.
[11:42:23.920 --> 11:42:38.920]  I think that's great for that part of the media outlet, but independent media people are going to be the ones that will really tell the real story of what happens at Occupy Dallas.
[11:42:38.920 --> 11:42:40.920]  So that's my goal right now.
[11:42:40.920 --> 11:42:56.920]  My heart is on teaching people how to use their cell phones to make videos and instantaneously up those videos to YouTube and have instant news reporting on the ground at Occupy Dallas.
[11:42:56.920 --> 11:43:05.920]  I've said it before and I'll say it again now is the time, whether it's using this electronic media to broadcast almost instantly or just getting out there.
[11:43:05.920 --> 11:43:10.920]  This is the time in history where if we're going to make a difference, we're going to make it now.
[11:43:10.920 --> 11:43:13.920]  And that's why we're doing this infowars money bomb to try to grow.
[11:43:13.920 --> 11:43:20.920]  That's why we're telling people to get out on the streets and reach people while everyone's focused on these issues.
[11:43:20.920 --> 11:43:23.920]  But they always have a global solution for everything.
[11:43:23.920 --> 11:43:27.920]  At the same time, though, we've seen everything that's looming in Europe.
[11:43:27.920 --> 11:43:37.920]  Greece has at least floated the idea of reprinting the drachma. I know Germany has has rumored to have the Deutsche Mark ready to go.
[11:43:37.920 --> 11:43:41.920]  In the case of Euro collapse, why is it always a global solution?
[11:43:41.920 --> 11:43:43.920]  I've heard about countries like Argentina.
[11:43:43.920 --> 11:43:44.920]  It's late at night.
[11:43:44.920 --> 11:43:48.920]  I don't know if I mixed the facts, but they returned to their currency.
[11:43:48.920 --> 11:43:50.920]  It was devalued.
[11:43:50.920 --> 11:43:51.920]  It wasn't worth much.
[11:43:51.920 --> 11:43:57.920]  Their economy crashed, but they also recovered in just about a year and then they were stronger than ever.
[11:43:57.920 --> 11:44:02.920]  Why is it always a greater global solution we're pushed into when obviously there could be other solutions?
[11:44:02.920 --> 11:44:11.920]  I'm not saying returning to the drachma or the Deutsche Mark is best for the world, but it's time to look at these things, I think.
[11:44:11.920 --> 11:44:15.920]  Well, Aaron, it's about control is what it's about, ultimately.
[11:44:15.920 --> 11:44:19.920]  And the easiest thing in life is self-provision.
[11:44:19.920 --> 11:44:34.920]  The reason why providing for yourself is so easy is because it's actually ordered into nature or ordered into the universe, just like air, oxygen that we breathe or water that we drink.
[11:44:34.920 --> 11:44:38.920]  Food also is ordered into nature in the same type of way.
[11:44:38.920 --> 11:44:50.920]  And when you really understand how great the evils that they're capable of, it's when you figure out that they really killed our food.
[11:44:50.920 --> 11:44:51.920]  They killed our food.
[11:44:51.920 --> 11:44:56.920]  We could have pomegranates growing in our cities.
[11:44:56.920 --> 11:44:58.920]  We could have pomegranate trees.
[11:44:58.920 --> 11:45:00.920]  We could have pecan trees growing.
[11:45:00.920 --> 11:45:08.920]  There's no reason why we shouldn't have readily access to food, just like you do oxygen and water.
[11:45:08.920 --> 11:45:13.920]  Yeah, but instead they have weaponized it just as Kissinger talked about in the 70s in a different context.
[11:45:13.920 --> 11:45:20.920]  They've weaponized the food through the GMOs and all the additives and little bonus chemicals they put in our water and our air supply.
[11:45:20.920 --> 11:45:21.920]  It's true.
[11:45:21.920 --> 11:45:26.920]  Well, you said, yeah, we should have a right to food and it really should be a natural part of our lives.
[11:45:26.920 --> 11:45:33.920]  But instead they've sold us on the dehumanization and got us to accept the tyranny on our own right.
[11:45:33.920 --> 11:45:40.920]  You know, we just played the video, brain-eating vaccines, and in it there's some clips from THX 1138 George Lucas's film.
[11:45:40.920 --> 11:45:44.920]  And that's about a New World Order system and a future technocracy.
[11:45:44.920 --> 11:45:49.920]  And really the whole metaphor is, yes, there's a ruling class, but you never see them in the film.
[11:45:49.920 --> 11:45:50.920]  They're off screen.
[11:45:50.920 --> 11:45:54.920]  What really happened was the people enslaved themselves.
[11:45:54.920 --> 11:45:56.920]  People built up the system.
[11:45:56.920 --> 11:46:03.920]  They built the robots that regulate them and they bought into this drugging themselves to suppress their own humanity.
[11:46:03.920 --> 11:46:10.920]  In the film, the characters start to change when they stop taking the drugs and they return to their normal sexual behavior and their normal thoughts.
[11:46:10.920 --> 11:46:13.920]  And that's what really becomes revolutionary.
[11:46:13.920 --> 11:46:14.920]  Rick?
[11:46:14.920 --> 11:46:22.920]  Well, it's hard to say, Erin, if that would, you know, that obviously exists in human nature, that type of tension.
[11:46:22.920 --> 11:46:29.920]  If there's good and bad in everything or positive and negative in everything, then there's this tension between the two.
[11:46:29.920 --> 11:46:41.920]  And so I believe that these social engineers or the people who designed this multiple prong deceptive program,
[11:46:41.920 --> 11:46:50.920]  they obviously recognized that to some extent that there was this nature within us where we just would not want to accept the truth,
[11:46:50.920 --> 11:46:59.920]  who would not be interested enough in truth and reality to want to, you know, not only not fight for it,
[11:46:59.920 --> 11:47:02.920]  but just to kind of go along and even give up your rights.
[11:47:02.920 --> 11:47:03.920]  And here's a good example.
[11:47:03.920 --> 11:47:06.920]  It's a prime example, bring up Occupy Dallas.
[11:47:06.920 --> 11:47:09.920]  I keep bringing up Occupy Dallas because folks, I've been sleeping over there.
[11:47:09.920 --> 11:47:11.920]  My tent's been up there for a week now.
[11:47:11.920 --> 11:47:15.920]  And so I've got a real good handle on what's going on there.
[11:47:15.920 --> 11:47:24.920]  And in that microcosm, you have everything that you have in the real world, just kind of in a smaller little microcosm.
[11:47:24.920 --> 11:47:33.920]  So you have people there that, you know, they just want to give up their rights for the greater good of the whole cause.
[11:47:33.920 --> 11:47:37.920]  And then there's this other group of people, and it's about 50-50 now.
[11:47:37.920 --> 11:47:46.920]  There's this other group of people that are First Amendmenters, meaning that we know that the First Amendment recognizes our existing right just to be.
[11:47:46.920 --> 11:47:52.920]  And sometimes just being is enough because we are powerful, wonderful creatures.
[11:47:52.920 --> 11:47:54.920]  And that's what they're against.
[11:47:54.920 --> 11:48:01.920]  They're against this system that's been designed, the banking system, the financial system, the food, the medicine, the war, the drugs.
[11:48:01.920 --> 11:48:09.920]  All of it's designed to come against that natural design of you just being.
[11:48:09.920 --> 11:48:17.920]  And just being is enough because when you're being, you're disseminating truth, you're in that context of disseminating truth.
[11:48:17.920 --> 11:48:19.920]  Truth does something magical.
[11:48:19.920 --> 11:48:26.920]  Truth, it inspires us and encourages us, which in other words for those are strengthens us.
[11:48:26.920 --> 11:48:34.920]  So there really is a strengthening process and just hanging out, having good conversations about truth and reality.
[11:48:34.920 --> 11:48:45.920]  And so that's the way that I see the program that Dave designed, this deception program or this brainwashing program, is that it's really all designed to keep you down.
[11:48:45.920 --> 11:48:51.920]  And that's the evidence that they recognize that you're actually a very powerful person.
[11:48:51.920 --> 11:48:52.920]  Oh, I couldn't agree more.
[11:48:52.920 --> 11:48:57.920]  That's really what it's all about, they're trying to limit our consciousness because we're capable of so much.
[11:48:57.920 --> 11:49:06.920]  And of course, if things were left to ourselves, it would never be perfect, but we can figure out in our communities and amongst ourselves individually how to take care of ourselves.
[11:49:06.920 --> 11:49:12.920]  God has provided so much, nature has provided so much that we can rely on.
[11:49:12.920 --> 11:49:27.920]  They've built up this whole false system of limited availability of these fiat dollars, this fake money to trap us into this so they could control us on the one hand, manage us efficiently, maintain the population according to their agenda,
[11:49:27.920 --> 11:49:33.920]  but also to keep us from thinking about the larger things and competing with the system that they brought out.
[11:49:33.920 --> 11:49:47.920]  I think that's a large part of what it's really all about and to take the Occupy spirit further, we need to do what you're saying, talk to people, just express our own consciousness, assert the things that we know into the public debate,
[11:49:47.920 --> 11:49:50.920]  into the public dimensions, the political sphere, the rest of it.
[11:49:50.920 --> 11:50:10.920]  We really need to occupy the whole world around us, occupy all those avenues where we have a voice, the political arena is one of them, just a possible scenario if a guy like Herman Cain were to get the GOP nomination despite all the effort and energy we put into Ron Paul.
[11:50:10.920 --> 11:50:23.920]  That's another opportunity just to expose the Fed, a former Federal Reserve chairman out of Kansas City, that's an opportunity to expose the tyranny of the system because of the kind of candidates who come to the top.
[11:50:23.920 --> 11:50:35.920]  Meanwhile, we don't give up, we have someone like Ron Paul run third party, we have people like Jesse Ventura talking about just simply operating outside of the left-right system, we have people standing up to the TSA and all the rest of it.
[11:50:35.920 --> 11:50:43.920]  I think it's a general Occupy spirit we need, I guess Gandhi put it into words so that people like Henry David Thoreau, Rick Warden.
[11:50:43.920 --> 11:50:46.920]  Yes, thank you for the setup.
[11:50:46.920 --> 11:51:03.920]  If I can speak directly to your listeners about the Occupy movement, Info War listeners by and large are going to be at First Amendment people, they're going to be lovers of liberty and there is a place for your voice to be heard within the Occupy movements.
[11:51:03.920 --> 11:51:11.920]  It's like any other thing though, I wouldn't encourage you to expect to go down there, spend 15 minutes and have a voice.
[11:51:11.920 --> 11:51:26.920]  There are people that have been down there for days and weeks and going on a month now, so you have to invest some time, you have to be patient with the process, but I promise you there is a place for your voice within the Occupy movement.
[11:51:26.920 --> 11:51:28.920]  That's number one.
[11:51:28.920 --> 11:51:38.920]  Number two is that I would really appreciate personally your voice and your support along with me and other lovers of liberty within the Occupy movement.
[11:51:38.920 --> 11:51:41.920]  And let me tell you why I'm saying this.
[11:51:41.920 --> 11:52:00.920]  What I'm experiencing on a daily basis is people that agree with me, agree with First Amendment issues, agree with just lovers of liberty, that the ending the Fed or auditing the Fed is really at the top of our goal right now in our country.
[11:52:00.920 --> 11:52:06.920]  And these kind of things, people that are like-minded, they'll go down and they'll get frustrated with the process and leave.
[11:52:06.920 --> 11:52:15.920]  And I encourage them. I'm like, well, don't you understand you're taking all your wonderful ideas and your passion and you're leaving.
[11:52:15.920 --> 11:52:21.920]  You're not helping by leaving or maybe they are if they're pissed off and not having a good time.
[11:52:21.920 --> 11:52:26.920]  But my point is, is that there is a place for your voice within the Occupy movement.
[11:52:26.920 --> 11:52:33.920]  You might have to be a little patient, but if you have time and you're compelled to do so, please come on down.
[11:52:33.920 --> 11:52:40.920]  Let me give you another example, Aaron. The Hare Krishna's have made a name for themselves feeding a lot of the Occupy camps.
[11:52:40.920 --> 11:52:46.920]  It's true. They have some of the best, healthiest food. They come to the camp every day and they feed us.
[11:52:46.920 --> 11:52:57.920]  And you know what? Last Sunday, just out of appreciation, probably about 40 people from Occupy Dallas, we attended the Hare Krishna service over here in Dallas on Sunday.
[11:52:57.920 --> 11:53:04.920]  Many of us dressed up in our Halloween garb. I was a zombie because we did a show on Saturday night where I dressed as a zombie.
[11:53:04.920 --> 11:53:12.920]  So I was dressed as a zombie dancing in their ceremony and doing some Michael Jackson thriller type stuff, you know, and we had a great time.
[11:53:12.920 --> 11:53:20.920]  So my point is, is that, I mean, my goodness, if you got a bus, go down there and pick up some people, take them over to the Federal Reserve.
[11:53:20.920 --> 11:53:30.920]  You know, go love on some people. I promise you there's a place for your voice to be heard. There's a place for your actions to actually have an impact.
[11:53:30.920 --> 11:53:42.920]  Yeah. On the other side of that, I want to encourage people not only to go down to these places physically, but to move your energy, your assets, your aspirations into the right areas.
[11:53:42.920 --> 11:53:48.920]  There's another sense of the Occupy term. I use it because it's been so well coined and it makes a lot of sense.
[11:53:48.920 --> 11:53:57.920]  Why occupy your spare energy into these dying systems, into these systems that by participating in them, you participate in your own slavery.
[11:53:57.920 --> 11:54:05.920]  You've seen people moving their money out of banks, out of these global banks into smaller credit unions and so forth.
[11:54:05.920 --> 11:54:12.920]  That makes a lot of sense, but do it in all areas of your life. You can't do it all at once. None of us need to be hypocrites.
[11:54:12.920 --> 11:54:21.920]  We all participate in some things that are negative, but we need to try to move what energy and resources and finances we can into the things we believe in.
[11:54:21.920 --> 11:54:29.920]  And that goes along with the concept of voting with your dollars. You want to try to fund independent businesses that you believe in.
[11:54:29.920 --> 11:54:36.920]  And that goes for Infowars too. If you believe in the mission we've had, please help us financially. Please help us spread the word.
[11:54:36.920 --> 11:54:45.920]  Please go out there physically as Rick is doing and speak truth to power, but also speak truth to pastors by who are completely ignorant.
[11:54:45.920 --> 11:54:59.920]  And we really need to, in whatever ways we can, try to occupy the avenues that can help us grow into better areas and evacuate the systems that only contribute to our overall death and enslavement.
[11:54:59.920 --> 11:55:06.920]  And that's part of what we're trying to do here at Infowars with the Money Bomb mission and with our ongoing mission throughout the years.
[11:55:06.920 --> 11:55:11.920]  You've seen the growth we've had. We can do more. Please help us. Thanks to everyone who has donated.
[11:55:11.920 --> 11:55:20.920]  If you haven't, please check out InfowarsMoneyBomb.com, and it's not too late to share that link with friends, family, strangers, and so forth.
[11:55:20.920 --> 11:55:25.920]  Rick, your closing comments, and then we have Paul Joseph Watson coming up in just a few minutes.
[11:55:25.920 --> 11:55:35.920]  Other guests as well. Alex will be back in just a few hours, and we have the exclusive video for Charlotte Isherby on Skull and Bones also coming up later.
[11:55:35.920 --> 11:55:37.920]  Rick Warden, your closing comments.
[11:55:37.920 --> 11:55:45.920]  First off, thank you very much, Aaron, Rob, Alex Jones. I don't know where I would be without Alex Jones.
[11:55:45.920 --> 11:55:50.920]  I've been listening to Alex Jones for 15 years. I've been following Ron Paul for 15 years.
[11:55:50.920 --> 11:56:00.920]  I want to say the last Money Bomb. What was it like, or the first one? This is only the second one, and so the first one was five years ago or something?
[11:56:00.920 --> 11:56:03.920]  Well, I think it was three years ago.
[11:56:03.920 --> 11:56:05.920]  Three? Three? Ever less?
[11:56:05.920 --> 11:56:07.920]  It's real late at night. I don't know.
[11:56:07.920 --> 11:56:18.920]  Well, Infowars really turned the corner. That was a great Money Bomb, and just overall with all the special speakers, it just, I don't know, Alex's spirit just came alive, and he's just been wonderful ever since.
[11:56:18.920 --> 11:56:27.920]  So thank you, everybody, contributing to this Money Bomb. Thank you to my friends who have called me and said, yeah, I donated to Alex today, so y'all are all awesome.
[11:56:27.920 --> 11:56:40.920]  Alex needs your support. He is by far the best media source that we have in the world today taking on the New World Order, and yes, we have won.
[11:56:40.920 --> 11:56:47.920]  We have won, and this is just enjoying the process of winning against tyranny.
[11:56:47.920 --> 11:56:56.920]  And then on a personal note, I want to encourage your listeners, please, everybody, go over to the Facebook page, which is Occupy the Fed Dallas.
[11:56:56.920 --> 11:57:06.920]  What is nearest and truest to my heart right now is empowering you. You have a cell phone, a smartphone. It has a video camera on it.
[11:57:06.920 --> 11:57:13.920]  You can make a video. It has to be under two minutes or so. Load that video directly to YouTube.
[11:57:13.920 --> 11:57:20.920]  You can go anywhere you want. You can go to the Federal Reserve Bank tomorrow and just make a video out there just speaking your mind.
[11:57:20.920 --> 11:57:28.920]  You don't have to have anyone with you, or you can go on Saturday when there's 500 people there and make your own video.
[11:57:28.920 --> 11:57:36.920]  Become a news reporter if you're so compelled to. That's what I'm finding is that a lot of people are telling me, how do you do what you do?
[11:57:36.920 --> 11:57:46.920]  The truth is, I have, what, 500, 600 videos online right now? The majority of them, 500 of them were shot on my cell phone.
[11:57:46.920 --> 11:57:53.920]  And so it's that simple, folks. So go to the Facebook page that is Occupy the Fed Dallas.
[11:57:53.920 --> 11:58:08.920]  I posted a note there earlier today that gives you step-by-step instructions as to how to create your own little info warrior or truth media empire right there after your cell phone.
[11:58:08.920 --> 11:58:16.920]  Well, thanks, Rick. And of course, you make a good point that the technology they've built to enslave us, in some cases, is a poisonous.
[11:58:16.920 --> 11:58:26.920]  We know cell phones have contributed to tumors and also fertility and so forth. We can also use those exact kind of tools, the Facebook tools that are meant to track us.
[11:58:26.920 --> 11:58:31.920]  We can use those against the system as well to get the word out why those platforms are there.
[11:58:31.920 --> 11:58:37.920]  I know in just a minute we're going to go to another video and then coming up after that is Paul Joseph Watson.
[11:58:37.920 --> 11:58:46.920]  But really, this is an information warfare. This is information war in a time of information revolution. I can't stress that enough.
[11:58:46.920 --> 11:58:53.920]  Please look at history. Look at how we've never had this kind of access to information before. What are we going to do with that information?
[11:58:53.920 --> 11:58:58.920]  The power we have now. What direction are we going to take it? That's really what this fight is all about.
[11:58:58.920 --> 11:59:18.920]  We here at Info Wars have made our decision and we just want you to help us build that platform and send that metaphoric rocket out into space and spread that information as far and wide as we can to try to take hold to try to occupy that available information stratosphere bit by bit
[11:59:18.920 --> 11:59:28.920]  and try to take back some liberty for all the tyranny that they've tried to advance. Do we have that video ready now guys?
[11:59:28.920 --> 11:59:39.920]  I'm told we do have that video so we're going to go now. It's been an honor to sit in on the money bomb. We thank you, everyone who's donated financially or to spread their word or even just stayed up to watch us.
[11:59:39.920 --> 11:59:51.920]  I know so many people just from watching the money bomb knowing that it's kind of a milestone event have gotten the spark to take action themselves. Some of our staff have told me they began to take action and now they work here.
[11:59:51.920 --> 12:00:00.920]  Incidentally, after watching the money bomb, maybe not even thinking they were part of the fight. Other people I've talked to as well watching that later taking action themselves.
[12:00:00.920 --> 12:00:12.920]  Don't forget this moment in time. It's so important and critical in history. It's been an honor to speak to you here on this platform. Please help us spread the word and archive this broadcast. Everything.
[12:00:12.920 --> 12:00:17.920]  You know what's going on. So let other people know too. Let's go to that video now. Stay tuned.
[12:00:17.920 --> 12:00:41.920]  Well, Tim, you guys, we do a lot of managing around here and I decided to change our policies here at InfoWars. From now on we are not going to allow any of the crew to bring their own lunches.
[12:00:41.920 --> 12:00:52.920]  Everyone will now buy their lunch in the break room cafeteria and we will decide. I will decide what people eat now.
[12:00:52.920 --> 12:01:00.920]  For a long time, I thought that liberty and freedom was good, but now I realize that liberty and freedom is the freedom to not think.
[12:01:00.920 --> 12:01:11.920]  And I noticed the Chicago School District has announced at many of their schools that parents are not allowed to pack the school lunches for their children. I noticed Mayor Bloomberg in New York wants to ban French fries and salt and things.
[12:01:11.920 --> 12:01:18.920]  They're talking about huge fines. People don't. And I think that's great. I hope Texas passes a law record and have staff around here arrested.
[12:01:18.920 --> 12:01:33.920]  Have I seen any French fries or have you bring your own food? In fact, we are owned by the state. That's what Land of the Free Home of the Brave is all about. And I'm going to pick a food program to follow the government's idea. Only corn syrup, aspartame, MSG, and fluoride water.
[12:01:33.920 --> 12:01:37.920]  Well, do you have any comments on that?
[12:01:37.920 --> 12:01:47.920]  So no food from home. We're just straight from here. Buy it from the work lounge, huh? Are you going to provide us with the details of the food safe for us?
[12:01:47.920 --> 12:02:01.920]  Listen, questioning is not what you do in America. Are you an extremist? Watch it, buddy. Watch it. Talk like that's what lets al Qaeda hit us and hit us hard, okay?
[12:02:01.920 --> 12:02:07.920]  By the way, we're overcharged about three times what the food's worth. You understand?
[12:02:07.920 --> 12:02:10.920]  We'll get the price less up.
[12:02:10.920 --> 12:02:20.920]  We're hitting with the new America. I was wrong all these years. I want you to go ahead and order a biometric scanner like they got at most of these lunch counters in public schools.
[12:02:20.920 --> 12:02:25.920]  People are going to biometrically scan to make sure you're buying your lunch here, because that's also part of the job.
[12:02:25.920 --> 12:02:35.920]  And because terrorists could strike at any time, especially in this facility, I want to buy one of those body scanners and I want to start having a security guard to take their hand down on everybody's pants that come to work here.
[12:02:35.920 --> 12:02:37.920]  That's going to make it safer.
[12:02:37.920 --> 12:02:40.920]  Are you thinking bad things about that?
[12:02:40.920 --> 12:02:47.920]  No, no, I'm just wondering, you know, it might just take more time away from getting worked down your health. We got to go through scanners every morning or something like that.
[12:02:47.920 --> 12:02:55.920]  Weldon, I want you to be safe. You can't be trusted bringing your own food to work. Man, I can't believe I'm just trying to be a patriot and trying to make sure you're safe and you're acting like that.
[12:02:55.920 --> 12:03:00.920]  What about you, Tim? I mean, are you with Weldon? Are you an extremist?
[12:03:00.920 --> 12:03:07.920]  No, I'll go along with it. I think I can understand where you're coming from, I guess.
[12:03:07.920 --> 12:03:13.920]  I think it's kind of extremist. I mean, you know, kind of delusional in a way. I mean, we've got to protect everybody.
[12:03:13.920 --> 12:03:17.920]  They come to work, they expect to work and be protected while they're at work.
[12:03:17.920 --> 12:03:20.920]  She thought it might, but yeah.
[12:03:20.920 --> 12:03:27.920]  Wait a minute, you just looked me in the eyes. The TSA manual says if you look, a federal commander in the eyes, that's a sign of aggression.
[12:03:27.920 --> 12:03:31.920]  Weldon, just admit that you have got a sickness.
[12:03:31.920 --> 12:03:38.920]  You're a sickness that you would want to be able to bring your own lunch or give a packet for your own children for school.
[12:03:38.920 --> 12:03:43.920]  What type? What is wrong with you, man? Does a prisoner get to choose what they eat?
[12:03:43.920 --> 12:03:49.920]  See there, Weldon? Weldon, you've got to learn. Two plus two doesn't necessarily equal four. It equals whatever I say.
[12:03:49.920 --> 12:03:52.920]  Now, are you supporting the new freedom?
[12:03:52.920 --> 12:03:58.920]  I'm with it, I understand. Just, we'll get the word around and just need to feel safe, you know.
[12:03:58.920 --> 12:04:02.920]  I'm really glad that you came to your senses. Now, whose crackers are these?
[12:04:02.920 --> 12:04:04.920]  We're mine.
[12:04:04.920 --> 12:04:12.920]  You've got five minutes to get them out of the building. I don't know if we'll see this again. Get them out of here.
[12:04:12.920 --> 12:04:16.920]  And hey, don't think I'm trying to intimidate you right now and get in your face.
[12:04:16.920 --> 12:04:23.920]  When they groped that little six-year-old girl, I mean, kept her safe at that airport, the parents reportedly, the TSA, bowed up and got their face.
[12:04:23.920 --> 12:04:27.920]  That's freedom. I'm just following what the federal government does.
[12:04:27.920 --> 12:04:32.920]  If bowing up on parents, because they don't like their kid being groped, is what our government does, is what I do.
[12:04:32.920 --> 12:04:35.920]  You got a problem? Is there going to be a problem?
[12:04:35.920 --> 12:04:36.920]  No problem.
[12:04:36.920 --> 12:04:58.920]  Freedom. Freedom, the hall of God, I got power down.
[12:04:58.920 --> 12:05:06.920]  Good. That's freedom. That's freedom.
[12:05:06.920 --> 12:05:09.920]  Good news, y'all. Check this out.
[12:05:09.920 --> 12:05:15.920]  From now on, you don't have to bring any food to work anymore. You don't have to think about what you can eat for lunch.
[12:05:15.920 --> 12:05:22.920]  We're going to have an employee meal plan, so you're only allowed to buy lunch from the company break room.
[12:05:22.920 --> 12:05:29.920]  Straight from the top, so outside food and drink. From now on, prohibited.
[12:05:29.920 --> 12:05:37.920]  Even more exciting news is we've got bottled water available with sodium fluoride for your safety.
[12:05:37.920 --> 12:05:44.920]  Don't have to think anymore about what to bring. From now on, no more outside food or water. We got it all here.
[12:05:44.920 --> 12:05:46.920]  But I'm on a budget.
[12:05:46.920 --> 12:05:56.920]  It's all right. Don't worry about it. You're still going to have to pay for it. But it's, you know, we can take it out of your paycheck.
[12:05:56.920 --> 12:05:57.920]  What's that?
[12:05:57.920 --> 12:05:59.920]  My mom makes my lunch.
[12:05:59.920 --> 12:06:07.920]  Well, that's old fashioned, and that's not what the state proves of anymore. So we're going to do what the state tells us to do.
[12:06:07.920 --> 12:06:10.920]  So I've got these for you.
[12:06:10.920 --> 12:06:12.920]  Can I just finish this?
[12:06:12.920 --> 12:06:22.920]  No. Well, I mean, you got like five minutes, basically. So I don't know, either, you know, whatever you got to do, you got five minutes, and then it's in effect.
[12:06:22.920 --> 12:06:24.920]  Thanks for looking out for me.
[12:06:24.920 --> 12:06:31.920]  Take two. And I'll leave one more here you guys can post it.
[12:06:31.920 --> 12:06:41.920]  So welcome to the new world order.
[12:06:41.920 --> 12:06:44.920]  This sucks, guys. I'm a vegetarian.
[12:06:44.920 --> 12:06:56.920]  It's okay. They want us to eat safer food.
[12:06:56.920 --> 12:07:00.920]  Well, well, well, well, we've been to Aaron Dykes. How you doing, buddy?
[12:07:00.920 --> 12:07:01.920]  Howdy.
[12:07:01.920 --> 12:07:03.920]  What are you doing right now?
[12:07:03.920 --> 12:07:05.920]  Just eating lunch while I'm going over some stories.
[12:07:05.920 --> 12:07:07.920]  Excuse me.
[12:07:07.920 --> 12:07:09.920]  What are you doing in the truck?
[12:07:09.920 --> 12:07:13.920]  Listen, buddy, that's what they do at the Chicago public school system.
[12:07:13.920 --> 12:07:18.920]  There's like some kind of boss hog town where I got to buy my food from the state store.
[12:07:18.920 --> 12:07:23.920]  Whoa. You are an extremist. You know, they have new mental illness designations.
[12:07:23.920 --> 12:07:27.920]  When you challenge authority in any way, it's a sign that you're dangerous.
[12:07:27.920 --> 12:07:30.920]  Maybe I should send the FBI or Homeland Security over here.
[12:07:30.920 --> 12:07:32.920]  I don't think so.
[12:07:32.920 --> 12:07:37.920]  You're going to buy your food from this office because I know it's safe and I care about you and I have the moral high ground.
[12:07:37.920 --> 12:07:39.920]  Don't argue with me.
[12:07:39.920 --> 12:07:42.920]  And by the way, this system's going in nationwide.
[12:07:42.920 --> 12:07:44.920]  Don't think you'll just quit this job and get away from this.
[12:07:44.920 --> 12:07:47.920]  Don't think you'll just stop at public schools in Chicago or New York.
[12:07:47.920 --> 12:07:48.920]  You understand?
[12:07:48.920 --> 12:07:50.920]  Those are organic.
[12:07:50.920 --> 12:07:53.920]  Organic?
[12:07:53.920 --> 12:07:55.920]  What's this about boss hog? What are you talking about?
[12:07:55.920 --> 12:07:57.920]  Oh, like, this is a sharecropper operation.
[12:07:57.920 --> 12:07:59.920]  You got to buy your stuff from the company store.
[12:07:59.920 --> 12:08:01.920]  I'll be honest with you. That's exactly what this is.
[12:08:01.920 --> 12:08:03.920]  And they're all submitting to it.
[12:08:03.920 --> 12:08:04.920]  I like it.
[12:08:04.920 --> 12:08:07.920]  So you think you're a thinker? Get up and get your ass out of this office.
[12:08:07.920 --> 12:08:13.920]  You're fired and I'm calling Homeland Security on you. Get out of here.
[12:08:13.920 --> 12:08:17.920]  You're a dying breed. We're running you out of this country and we're taking over the whole planet.
[12:08:17.920 --> 12:08:19.920]  You understand me?
[12:08:19.920 --> 12:08:22.920]  The future belongs to the slave masters.
[12:08:22.920 --> 12:08:25.920]  You're fired.
[12:08:25.920 --> 12:08:30.920]  Oh, God, it's going to be so much fun when you arrest him.
[12:08:30.920 --> 12:08:48.920]  Music
[12:08:48.920 --> 12:08:50.920]  Hey, production crew.
[12:08:50.920 --> 12:08:52.920]  Hey.
[12:08:52.920 --> 12:08:55.920]  You guys going to buy me lunch out of the back today?
[12:08:55.920 --> 12:08:56.920]  No problem, I'll lunch.
[12:08:56.920 --> 12:08:57.920]  Yeah, me too.
[12:08:57.920 --> 12:09:00.920]  You saw the memo that went out at 9 a.m.
[12:09:00.920 --> 12:09:04.920]  Memo? It didn't have time to do anything else, though.
[12:09:04.920 --> 12:09:07.920]  Dude, you saw all the food we got there for you to buy?
[12:09:07.920 --> 12:09:09.920]  That's totally reasonable.
[12:09:09.920 --> 12:09:14.920]  Are you saying the Chicago school system's wrong, not letting parents pack their lunches?
[12:09:14.920 --> 12:09:17.920]  Are you saying Mayor Bloomberg's wrong, Phil?
[12:09:17.920 --> 12:09:19.920]  Yeah, I am. It doesn't seem right.
[12:09:19.920 --> 12:09:21.920]  Well, here's the deal. Here's the deal.
[12:09:21.920 --> 12:09:24.920]  Okay?
[12:09:24.920 --> 12:09:28.920]  Well, it's on me today. I'll buy your first lunch and I'm doing you a favor.
[12:09:28.920 --> 12:09:30.920]  But that stuff's going to the trash, okay, buddy?
[12:09:30.920 --> 12:09:31.920]  Wait, what do you want?
[12:09:31.920 --> 12:09:32.920]  I'm going to throw in the trash, man.
[12:09:32.920 --> 12:09:33.920]  What?
[12:09:33.920 --> 12:09:35.920]  Listen, you saw the policy.
[12:09:35.920 --> 12:09:37.920]  Well, I...
[12:09:37.920 --> 12:09:38.920]  Look.
[12:09:38.920 --> 12:09:39.920]  That's an entire salad.
[12:09:39.920 --> 12:09:43.920]  I can't 100% know this is healthy and good for you, okay?
[12:09:43.920 --> 12:09:46.920]  Mayor Bloomberg's a very respected man.
[12:09:46.920 --> 12:09:48.920]  He also wants everybody to turn their firearms in.
[12:09:48.920 --> 12:09:50.920]  There you go, pal.
[12:09:50.920 --> 12:09:53.920]  You heard about how they've got giant fines for salt?
[12:09:53.920 --> 12:09:55.920]  Look at that.
[12:09:55.920 --> 12:09:58.920]  That there's salt on this chicken.
[12:09:58.920 --> 12:10:00.920]  They're trying to pass laws like this in Austin.
[12:10:00.920 --> 12:10:02.920]  That could shut us down. We're getting with the times.
[12:10:02.920 --> 12:10:04.920]  We're trendy. Do you understand that?
[12:10:04.920 --> 12:10:06.920]  You know it's totally reasonable, Phil.
[12:10:06.920 --> 12:10:07.920]  It's for your own good, man.
[12:10:07.920 --> 12:10:08.920]  Yeah, thank you.
[12:10:08.920 --> 12:10:09.920]  Thank you, Jared.
[12:10:09.920 --> 12:10:12.920]  Not mine.
[12:10:12.920 --> 12:10:13.920]  Here we go.
[12:10:13.920 --> 12:10:16.920]  Now, like I said, I'm going to be nice there.
[12:10:16.920 --> 12:10:17.920]  Everybody else has got to buy theirs.
[12:10:17.920 --> 12:10:19.920]  I'm going to buy lunch for you, okay?
[12:10:19.920 --> 12:10:21.920]  Get up. Let's go. I've got to eat lunch.
[12:10:21.920 --> 12:10:23.920]  You know you appreciate it.
[12:10:29.920 --> 12:10:32.920]  God, what won't that Chicago mafia think of next?
[12:10:32.920 --> 12:10:33.920]  This is going to be real.
[12:10:33.920 --> 12:10:36.920]  Oh, hi, guys. I care about your health.
[12:10:36.920 --> 12:10:38.920]  Come on in, Matt and Tim.
[12:10:38.920 --> 12:10:40.920]  You guys like the new policy?
[12:10:40.920 --> 12:10:44.920]  It's only $20 for this salad.
[12:10:44.920 --> 12:10:46.920]  Or I've got some fluoridated baby water here.
[12:10:46.920 --> 12:10:48.920]  Only $3 a bottle.
[12:10:48.920 --> 12:10:51.920]  You can have ramen noodle, bananas, lunchables.
[12:10:51.920 --> 12:10:53.920]  We've got some spam.
[12:10:53.920 --> 12:10:57.920]  And we've also got some Vienna sausages.
[12:10:57.920 --> 12:10:59.920]  So what would you like here?
[12:10:59.920 --> 12:11:02.920]  Well, I brought my own banana. Is that okay?
[12:11:02.920 --> 12:11:07.920]  No, sir. We can't trust you to bring your own food, okay?
[12:11:07.920 --> 12:11:10.920]  Is there anything other than the fluoridated water?
[12:11:10.920 --> 12:11:12.920]  Sir, fluoride freaks into your teeth.
[12:11:12.920 --> 12:11:14.920]  Don't be like the extremist kids that protested
[12:11:14.920 --> 12:11:16.920]  and they were called revolutionary extremists in Chicago
[12:11:16.920 --> 12:11:18.920]  and are probably now on FBI list, okay, buddy?
[12:11:18.920 --> 12:11:19.920]  Okay.
[12:11:19.920 --> 12:11:20.920]  This is reasonable.
[12:11:20.920 --> 12:11:22.920]  Not being able to decide what you're going to eat is freedom, okay?
[12:11:22.920 --> 12:11:24.920]  The government cares about you. Michelle Obama cares.
[12:11:24.920 --> 12:11:26.920]  Look. Look here.
[12:11:28.920 --> 12:11:30.920]  Okay, carrots. Now, listen.
[12:11:30.920 --> 12:11:31.920]  Hey, pal.
[12:11:31.920 --> 12:11:32.920]  I love liberty.
[12:11:32.920 --> 12:11:34.920]  Now, I've gotten left my wall in the car.
[12:11:34.920 --> 12:11:35.920]  That's okay. That's okay.
[12:11:35.920 --> 12:11:37.920]  We're putting in a biometric scanner next week.
[12:11:37.920 --> 12:11:39.920]  Just mark it down in there on the board.
[12:11:39.920 --> 12:11:41.920]  And pretty soon we're just going to deduct it from your check anyway
[12:11:41.920 --> 12:11:42.920]  so you don't have a choice.
[12:11:42.920 --> 12:11:43.920]  I'll grab a salad.
[12:11:43.920 --> 12:11:45.920]  Okay, good. Good. See, you had a choice.
[12:11:45.920 --> 12:11:46.920]  You had a choice here.
[12:11:46.920 --> 12:11:47.920]  Okay. Come on.
[12:12:05.920 --> 12:12:07.920]  Found one of the employees with...
[12:12:09.920 --> 12:12:10.920]  Good job.
[12:12:10.920 --> 12:12:11.920]  You caught him with a pariet.
[12:12:11.920 --> 12:12:13.920]  Let me get that in the trash.
[12:12:13.920 --> 12:12:15.920]  Well, then you really turned it around since this morning.
[12:12:15.920 --> 12:12:16.920]  So your lunch is free.
[12:12:16.920 --> 12:12:17.920]  Thanks.
[12:12:17.920 --> 12:12:19.920]  That's how a fascist communist criminal...
[12:12:19.920 --> 12:12:20.920]  I mean, freedom system works.
[12:12:20.920 --> 12:12:22.920]  And take whatever else you'd like.
[12:12:22.920 --> 12:12:23.920]  Good job.
[12:12:23.920 --> 12:12:25.920]  And I want you to keep your eyes on Phil.
[12:12:25.920 --> 12:12:26.920]  Okay.
[12:12:26.920 --> 12:12:27.920]  We can do it.
[12:12:27.920 --> 12:12:28.920]  All right. Thank you very much. Good job.
[12:12:28.920 --> 12:12:29.920]  All right, man.
[12:12:29.920 --> 12:12:31.920]  I'm really feeling powerful right now.
[12:12:31.920 --> 12:12:32.920]  Getting to tell them what they eat.
[12:12:32.920 --> 12:12:34.920]  And I'm really enjoying this.
[12:12:34.920 --> 12:12:35.920]  Man, this is great.
[12:12:35.920 --> 12:12:36.920]  Ah.
[12:12:36.920 --> 12:12:41.920]  No, no.
[12:12:43.920 --> 12:12:44.920]  No, please.
[12:12:44.920 --> 12:12:45.920]  Oh, God.
[12:12:45.920 --> 12:12:46.920]  This is horrible.
[12:12:46.920 --> 12:12:47.920]  What's happened to America?
[12:12:48.920 --> 12:12:49.920]  Hey, Alex.
[12:12:49.920 --> 12:12:50.920]  Hey, Alex.
[12:12:50.920 --> 12:12:51.920]  Parents are slaves.
[12:12:51.920 --> 12:12:52.920]  Hey, Alex. Hey, Alex.
[12:12:52.920 --> 12:12:53.920]  Wake up.
[12:12:53.920 --> 12:12:54.920]  We got a show in five minutes.
[12:12:54.920 --> 12:12:55.920]  Huh?
[12:12:55.920 --> 12:12:56.920]  Oh, God.
[12:12:56.920 --> 12:12:58.920]  Oh, Jared, I've never been so glad to see you.
[12:12:58.920 --> 12:13:00.920]  I woke up in a futuristic America
[12:13:00.920 --> 12:13:02.920]  where I was a police state control freak thug
[12:13:02.920 --> 12:13:03.920]  like Janet Napolitano.
[12:13:03.920 --> 12:13:04.920]  Well, it's all good now.
[12:13:04.920 --> 12:13:07.920]  Welcome to 2011 where we still have all our freedoms intact.
[12:13:07.920 --> 12:13:08.920]  Come on.
[12:13:08.920 --> 12:13:09.920]  We got a show to do.
[12:13:09.920 --> 12:13:10.920]  Man, that's great.
[12:13:16.920 --> 12:13:17.920]  Hey, Alex.
[12:13:17.920 --> 12:13:19.920]  Those cameras came in from the studio backstage.
[12:13:19.920 --> 12:13:20.920]  Oh, awesome, man.
[12:13:20.920 --> 12:13:21.920]  Yeah. What's this?
[12:13:21.920 --> 12:13:22.920]  What's what?
[12:13:22.920 --> 12:13:23.920]  It's a salad.
[12:13:23.920 --> 12:13:25.920]  This morning, you passed out a memo saying
[12:13:25.920 --> 12:13:27.920]  that we can't bring our own lunches in,
[12:13:27.920 --> 12:13:29.920]  but yet you're bringing stuff from Wendy's.
[12:13:29.920 --> 12:13:31.920]  You got a memo?
[12:13:31.920 --> 12:13:34.920]  There was a memo?
[12:14:10.920 --> 12:14:12.920]  Many times I've lied.
[12:14:12.920 --> 12:14:15.920]  Many times I've listened.
[12:14:15.920 --> 12:14:20.920]  Many times I wonder how much the rest is known.
[12:14:20.920 --> 12:14:26.920]  It's the InfoWars Moneybomb Live.
[12:14:26.920 --> 12:14:28.920]  InfoWarsMoneybomb.com.
[12:14:28.920 --> 12:14:32.920]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, editor of PrisonPlanet.com,
[12:14:32.920 --> 12:14:34.920]  and I'll be your host for the next two hours.
[12:14:34.920 --> 12:14:36.920]  Bright, eyed, and bushy-tailed.
[12:14:36.920 --> 12:14:39.920]  It's just gone 9 a.m. here in the UK.
[12:14:39.920 --> 12:14:41.920]  And unlike the poor guys in the office,
[12:14:41.920 --> 12:14:44.920]  I've actually had a good night's sleep.
[12:14:44.920 --> 12:14:46.920]  So coming up, the lobby group,
[12:14:46.920 --> 12:14:50.920]  you've never heard of, caught in its own words admitting
[12:14:50.920 --> 12:14:52.920]  it controls the news.
[12:14:52.920 --> 12:14:55.920]  We've got former naval officer Brian Garris joining us
[12:14:55.920 --> 12:14:58.920]  to break that down and a whole lot more.
[12:14:58.920 --> 12:15:01.920]  Then in the next hour, we're really going to hit a topic
[12:15:01.920 --> 12:15:03.920]  that's going to wake you up this morning,
[12:15:03.920 --> 12:15:06.920]  and that is not one we normally tackle here
[12:15:06.920 --> 12:15:07.920]  on the Alex Jones show,
[12:15:07.920 --> 12:15:11.920]  and it's the always controversial issue of UFOs,
[12:15:11.920 --> 12:15:13.920]  UFO researchers.
[12:15:13.920 --> 12:15:16.920]  Tony Topping joins us in the next hour,
[12:15:16.920 --> 12:15:19.920]  so that's guaranteed to be interesting.
[12:15:19.920 --> 12:15:22.920]  But now I'm delighted to welcome someone who has been
[12:15:22.920 --> 12:15:25.920]  on the front lines of fighting the subversion
[12:15:25.920 --> 12:15:28.920]  of the British Isles into Airstrip 1
[12:15:28.920 --> 12:15:31.920]  of the European Federal Superstate.
[12:15:31.920 --> 12:15:33.920]  And that, of course, is Brian Garris,
[12:15:33.920 --> 12:15:34.920]  former naval officer,
[12:15:34.920 --> 12:15:38.920]  and, of course, now with the British Constitution Group.
[12:15:38.920 --> 12:15:41.920]  And also, I might add, the man who basically
[12:15:41.920 --> 12:15:43.920]  was the first to lift the lid
[12:15:43.920 --> 12:15:46.920]  on the sinister common-purpose organisation
[12:15:46.920 --> 12:15:48.920]  which has infested its operatives
[12:15:48.920 --> 12:15:51.920]  into every level of British society.
[12:15:51.920 --> 12:15:54.920]  So we're going to cover a host of interesting topics today.
[12:15:54.920 --> 12:15:56.920]  Brian Garris, good morning,
[12:15:56.920 --> 12:15:58.920]  and welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[12:15:58.920 --> 12:15:59.920]  Yeah, good morning, Paul,
[12:15:59.920 --> 12:16:02.920]  and thank you and Alex and all the rest of the crew
[12:16:02.920 --> 12:16:06.920]  for giving me an invite to speak.
[12:16:06.920 --> 12:16:09.920]  Well, you're welcome to be back on the show.
[12:16:09.920 --> 12:16:13.920]  First of all, obviously, you've been a guest previously,
[12:16:13.920 --> 12:16:16.920]  but before we get into the whole Liam Fox issue
[12:16:16.920 --> 12:16:18.920]  and the cover-up surrounding that,
[12:16:18.920 --> 12:16:20.920]  just tell us about your background
[12:16:20.920 --> 12:16:24.920]  and how you first began to uncover groups like Common Purpose
[12:16:24.920 --> 12:16:27.920]  and what they were up to in the United Kingdom.
[12:16:27.920 --> 12:16:30.920]  Okay, well, it will keep it very short.
[12:16:30.920 --> 12:16:36.920]  I spent 21 years in the Navy as a warfare officer.
[12:16:36.920 --> 12:16:40.920]  I left in 1993.
[12:16:40.920 --> 12:16:44.920]  I got involved in a small business,
[12:16:44.920 --> 12:16:48.920]  started to become what I'll call a normal person,
[12:16:48.920 --> 12:16:51.920]  and then in my home city of Plymouth,
[12:16:51.920 --> 12:16:55.920]  which is down in the southwest of England,
[12:16:55.920 --> 12:17:00.920]  I started to discover massive fraud and corruption,
[12:17:00.920 --> 12:17:03.920]  and much of it was to do with public money.
[12:17:03.920 --> 12:17:06.920]  So I started to dig into that more,
[12:17:06.920 --> 12:17:09.920]  and strange things began to happen
[12:17:09.920 --> 12:17:13.920]  because essentially I started to be threatened and warned off,
[12:17:13.920 --> 12:17:15.920]  and I wasn't too impressed with that
[12:17:15.920 --> 12:17:20.920]  because I always believed that my country was generally law-abiding.
[12:17:20.920 --> 12:17:22.920]  But then things came to a head
[12:17:22.920 --> 12:17:24.920]  when I tried to start a little project
[12:17:24.920 --> 12:17:27.920]  to help give unemployed young people
[12:17:27.920 --> 12:17:30.920]  some skills training and some hope from the future,
[12:17:30.920 --> 12:17:34.920]  and it was obvious that the local elite
[12:17:34.920 --> 12:17:36.920]  did not want this project to happen.
[12:17:36.920 --> 12:17:39.920]  And when I started to investigate why,
[12:17:39.920 --> 12:17:44.920]  not only did I get threatened more, including death threats,
[12:17:44.920 --> 12:17:49.920]  but I discovered a very sinister little organization
[12:17:49.920 --> 12:17:51.920]  called Common Purpose at work,
[12:17:51.920 --> 12:17:55.920]  and essentially, I'll say now with hindsight
[12:17:55.920 --> 12:17:57.920]  because it's much easier now to look back
[12:17:57.920 --> 12:17:59.920]  and put the pieces together,
[12:17:59.920 --> 12:18:03.920]  but the reason that I was treated in the way I was treated
[12:18:03.920 --> 12:18:05.920]  was because I was trying to help people,
[12:18:05.920 --> 12:18:07.920]  I was trying to help create jobs,
[12:18:07.920 --> 12:18:13.920]  I was trying to get confidence back into local communities.
[12:18:13.920 --> 12:18:15.920]  When unknown to me at the time,
[12:18:15.920 --> 12:18:18.920]  the government policy was the exact opposite.
[12:18:18.920 --> 12:18:22.920]  It was to destroy jobs, it was to break down communities,
[12:18:22.920 --> 12:18:27.920]  and it was to reduce young people to unemployed druggies.
[12:18:27.920 --> 12:18:30.920]  So that was the start of it.
[12:18:30.920 --> 12:18:34.920]  When I then began to really research into the subject
[12:18:34.920 --> 12:18:37.920]  and I began to get very good people helping me,
[12:18:37.920 --> 12:18:41.920]  we discovered that this organization, Common Purpose,
[12:18:41.920 --> 12:18:44.920]  which calls itself a charity,
[12:18:44.920 --> 12:18:47.920]  but what it was really doing was inserting
[12:18:47.920 --> 12:18:53.920]  a very, very dangerous political agenda into everywhere it could get,
[12:18:53.920 --> 12:18:57.920]  and what Common Purpose was and still is,
[12:18:57.920 --> 12:19:01.920]  it's in the political circles, it's in schools, it's in hospitals,
[12:19:01.920 --> 12:19:03.920]  it's in the military,
[12:19:03.920 --> 12:19:08.920]  and their so-called graduate leaders
[12:19:08.920 --> 12:19:13.920]  are pushing forward the overall political agenda,
[12:19:13.920 --> 12:19:15.920]  which is causing such problem.
[12:19:15.920 --> 12:19:17.920]  Now, when you were setting up the show,
[12:19:17.920 --> 12:19:20.920]  somebody mentioned communism,
[12:19:20.920 --> 12:19:25.920]  we're fighting something much, much more dangerous.
[12:19:25.920 --> 12:19:28.920]  It's Gromsky is the land we should be looking at.
[12:19:28.920 --> 12:19:30.920]  We should be looking at Saul Alinsky,
[12:19:30.920 --> 12:19:32.920]  and we should be looking at Gromsky,
[12:19:32.920 --> 12:19:37.920]  because this is Marxism,
[12:19:37.920 --> 12:19:40.920]  which is being imposed on America and Britain,
[12:19:40.920 --> 12:19:45.920]  and it's being done slowly, gently, piece by piece
[12:19:45.920 --> 12:19:49.920]  in a very hidden, subversive way.
[12:19:49.920 --> 12:19:55.920]  But that, in my view, is the ideology which Common Purpose is pushing.
[12:19:55.920 --> 12:19:59.920]  Now, a lot of these issues can be found at Brian's website,
[12:19:59.920 --> 12:20:02.920]  and they actually publish a newspaper,
[12:20:02.920 --> 12:20:04.920]  which I encourage people to subscribe to,
[12:20:04.920 --> 12:20:08.920]  and it's UKcolumn.org.
[12:20:08.920 --> 12:20:12.920]  Now, for our American audience who perhaps aren't aware of this,
[12:20:12.920 --> 12:20:14.920]  and if you're not, then you need to be,
[12:20:14.920 --> 12:20:18.920]  because it's very much a transatlantic controversy,
[12:20:18.920 --> 12:20:22.920]  and it takes on even more prominence given the news yesterday
[12:20:22.920 --> 12:20:24.920]  that Britain is basically now on a war footing
[12:20:24.920 --> 12:20:29.920]  to support the planned US and or Israeli strike on Iran.
[12:20:29.920 --> 12:20:33.920]  And this was a major story last month in the United Kingdom,
[12:20:33.920 --> 12:20:37.920]  and it was, of course, the resignation of British Defence Secretary,
[12:20:37.920 --> 12:20:40.920]  Liam Fox, which came as a result of his relationship
[12:20:40.920 --> 12:20:46.920]  with the lobbyist and all-round globalist insider, Adam Warrity.
[12:20:46.920 --> 12:20:48.920]  And, of course, Warrity, it turns out,
[12:20:48.920 --> 12:20:52.920]  was the frontman for this Atlantic Bridge Group,
[12:20:52.920 --> 12:20:57.920]  which in itself was funded by the Israeli lobby BiCom,
[12:20:57.920 --> 12:21:02.920]  with Warrity actually attending government meetings side by side
[12:21:02.920 --> 12:21:07.920]  with the British Defence Secretary on behalf of this pro-Israeli neocon faction.
[12:21:07.920 --> 12:21:11.920]  Of course, it led to Fox having to resign.
[12:21:11.920 --> 12:21:16.920]  Brian, this Warrity-Fox Atlantic Bridge BiCom issue,
[12:21:16.920 --> 12:21:18.920]  I mean, the tentacles run deep.
[12:21:18.920 --> 12:21:22.920]  It was almost universally ignored by the British press,
[12:21:22.920 --> 12:21:28.920]  who merely concentrated on the fact that Fox had broke some ministerial code.
[12:21:28.920 --> 12:21:31.920]  They weren't interested about everything else that was going on behind the scenes,
[12:21:31.920 --> 12:21:34.920]  and we'll certainly get into some of that later.
[12:21:34.920 --> 12:21:38.920]  But just how deep does this scandal with Liam Fox, Warrity,
[12:21:38.920 --> 12:21:42.920]  and all these shadowy lobbyist groups run?
[12:21:42.920 --> 12:21:45.920]  Well, the answer to that is it runs very deep.
[12:21:45.920 --> 12:21:51.920]  I'll just pick up on your point of what the British media did at the time.
[12:21:51.920 --> 12:21:54.920]  It was very interesting to watch what happened,
[12:21:54.920 --> 12:21:59.920]  because most of the British media just simply focused on Liam Fox.
[12:21:59.920 --> 12:22:04.920]  Liam Fox's relationship with Warrity as his best man
[12:22:04.920 --> 12:22:08.920]  and the fact that they dressed very in a similar style,
[12:22:08.920 --> 12:22:12.920]  and they clearly stayed with each other on a regular basis.
[12:22:12.920 --> 12:22:20.920]  So many of the press articles focused on the fact that there seemed to be a rather interesting,
[12:22:20.920 --> 12:22:26.920]  and some would say unnatural, relationship between Liam Fox and his best man.
[12:22:26.920 --> 12:22:31.920]  But one or two papers started to dig a bit deeper.
[12:22:31.920 --> 12:22:36.920]  But when they produced articles, the articles contained information,
[12:22:36.920 --> 12:22:38.920]  but it was very confusing.
[12:22:38.920 --> 12:22:42.920]  It was very hard to piece together what they were actually talking about.
[12:22:42.920 --> 12:22:48.920]  And I can say that we and a large number of other people have done a lot of research on this.
[12:22:48.920 --> 12:22:54.920]  And if I may, I'll just take listeners through some of the things that we now know.
[12:22:54.920 --> 12:23:01.920]  So if we set the scene, we've got British Secretary of State for Defence, Liam Fox.
[12:23:01.920 --> 12:23:05.920]  He chooses his best man as a personal adviser,
[12:23:05.920 --> 12:23:12.920]  and his best man actually makes out that he is a bona fide government adviser,
[12:23:12.920 --> 12:23:21.920]  and he then accompanies his best mate, Mr Fox, on tours and missions around the world.
[12:23:21.920 --> 12:23:26.920]  So there was instant deception that you had somebody who was not security-cleared
[12:23:26.920 --> 12:23:32.920]  being touted as if they were part of the British government, and that was Mr Werethy.
[12:23:32.920 --> 12:23:39.920]  But Werethy had set up a number of organisations which we really need to look at very closely,
[12:23:39.920 --> 12:23:42.920]  and certainly Americans need to look at this very closely,
[12:23:42.920 --> 12:23:50.920]  because these are the tentacles that are working very hard to drag both Britain and America
[12:23:50.920 --> 12:23:52.920]  into further wars.
[12:23:52.920 --> 12:23:59.920]  But I'll just add at this point that, of course, Britain almost has no armed forces left.
[12:23:59.920 --> 12:24:06.920]  Most Americans will simply not understand how big the cuts have been on British military.
[12:24:06.920 --> 12:24:12.920]  So when our Prime Minister, David Cameron, is talking about wars against Iran,
[12:24:12.920 --> 12:24:15.920]  it's not going to be a major effort by the British.
[12:24:15.920 --> 12:24:22.920]  It's going to be American lives that have lost fighting Cameron's allongering.
[12:24:22.920 --> 12:24:29.920]  But if I just bring you back to Mr Werethy, Paul has already mentioned Atlantic Bridge,
[12:24:29.920 --> 12:24:36.920]  which was a so-called charity to help drive and improve relations between Britain and America.
[12:24:36.920 --> 12:24:42.920]  But that charity was actually closed down by the formal body in the UK
[12:24:42.920 --> 12:24:48.920]  because it was highly political, and under the charity rules in the United Kingdom,
[12:24:48.920 --> 12:24:51.920]  you can't be political if you're a charity.
[12:24:51.920 --> 12:24:57.920]  So the Atlantic Bridge organisation was fraudulent itself.
[12:24:57.920 --> 12:25:06.920]  And when you look behind, we find, for example, people like John Falk, who's a US defence lobbyist,
[12:25:06.920 --> 12:25:15.920]  linked in with an organisation called Castro in the USA, which is ultimately linked through to Blackwater or Z.
[12:25:15.920 --> 12:25:26.920]  So we're not seeing just an innocent best man who happened to set up a charity to help relations with Britain and America.
[12:25:26.920 --> 12:25:34.920]  We're seeing a man who's intimately connected in with what I regard as international mercenary organisations.
[12:25:34.920 --> 12:25:41.920]  One of the papers that added a bit more was the Independent on Sunday because they ran an article,
[12:25:41.920 --> 12:25:47.920]  which was actually front page, and it said that Werethy, and let's remember,
[12:25:47.920 --> 12:25:54.920]  he is the man right alongside the then Secretary of State for Defence in Britain, Mr Fox,
[12:25:54.920 --> 12:26:00.920]  their headline said that Werethy plotted with Mossad to target Iran.
[12:26:00.920 --> 12:26:07.920]  So what was happening at the time that Leanne Fox scandal came to the surface
[12:26:07.920 --> 12:26:17.920]  was that it was clear that in the background work was going on in order to help start some form of conflict with Iran.
[12:26:17.920 --> 12:26:23.920]  And it was very interesting that another British paper, The Daily Mail,
[12:26:23.920 --> 12:26:29.920]  ran some paragraphs in which it said that many officials in the Ministry of Defence in Britain
[12:26:29.920 --> 12:26:41.920]  were becoming very, very concerned because they knew that people were acting in a private capacity to influence defence.
[12:26:41.920 --> 12:26:43.920]  It's more like a defence policy.
[12:26:43.920 --> 12:26:50.920]  And they also warned that Mossad was using useful idiots in the British government
[12:26:50.920 --> 12:26:55.920]  in order to help foment trouble on the world stage.
[12:26:55.920 --> 12:27:01.920]  So it was really quite interesting that if you did look right the way across the media,
[12:27:01.920 --> 12:27:07.920]  you could find a lot of information, but it was all in bits.
[12:27:07.920 --> 12:27:11.920]  There were other names that came forward in this scandal.
[12:27:11.920 --> 12:27:15.920]  One of them was Matthew Gould, the UK ambassador to Israel.
[12:27:15.920 --> 12:27:23.920]  He's an interesting character because he was originally the private parliamentary secretary to David Milliband.
[12:27:23.920 --> 12:27:31.920]  Of course, we've now got one of the Milliband brothers, Ed Milliband, who's leading the Labour Party in Britain.
[12:27:31.920 --> 12:27:38.920]  If we delve into his background, he comes from an absolutely dedicated Marxist family.
[12:27:38.920 --> 12:27:41.920]  So there's another little interesting bit.
[12:27:41.920 --> 12:27:49.920]  We find venture capitalists who donate £125,000 to the Conservative Party.
[12:27:49.920 --> 12:27:55.920]  The real meat of it is in relation to an organisation called Pargav.
[12:27:55.920 --> 12:28:02.920]  And this effectively was a lobbying group that Adam Warrity had set up.
[12:28:02.920 --> 12:28:12.920]  And once we start to look at Pargav, we find, well, not effectively because it's been reported in the press, but it's been hidden.
[12:28:12.920 --> 12:28:19.920]  We have a Finnish-Israeli arms dealer who's worth some £2 billion.
[12:28:19.920 --> 12:28:22.920]  We have him connected to Pargav.
[12:28:22.920 --> 12:28:29.920]  And we learn that he donated £15,000 for Cameron's leadership campaign.
[12:28:29.920 --> 12:28:32.920]  So here we have David Cameron.
[12:28:32.920 --> 12:28:34.920]  He appears out of nowhere.
[12:28:34.920 --> 12:28:37.920]  We call him a tough schoolboy from Eaton.
[12:28:37.920 --> 12:28:40.920]  He suddenly appears as the British Prime Minister.
[12:28:40.920 --> 12:28:50.920]  And now we're seeing that the type of people who have funded his leadership campaign are major international arms dealers.
[12:28:50.920 --> 12:29:03.920]  But he gets better than that because we can start to actually see that there are other groups involved.
[12:29:03.920 --> 12:29:10.920]  So there's the Thamiris Investment Group, which was paying money into Pargav as well.
[12:29:10.920 --> 12:29:19.920]  And that company owns, it is said, about 40% of the major property in Las Vegas casinos.
[12:29:19.920 --> 12:29:23.920]  It's got property in Washington, New York Times Square.
[12:29:23.920 --> 12:29:38.920]  So the people who are clustered around Mr. Warrity and therefore intimately linked with Mr. Fox are certainly major and extremely wealthy people, including arms dealers.
[12:29:38.920 --> 12:29:51.920]  But we can get in a little bit deeper on this because there was also a hedge fund called CQS involved.
[12:29:51.920 --> 12:29:58.920]  This was also linked through a man called Oliver Hilton into Pargav.
[12:29:58.920 --> 12:30:07.920]  And CQS invested some £21.5 million in a high-tech firm called L3.
[12:30:07.920 --> 12:30:21.920]  And when Mr. Fox scrapped Britain's Nimrods, these are equivalent to the American maritime patrol aircraft, such as the then P3, they're the same age.
[12:30:21.920 --> 12:30:28.920]  But the moment those aircraft were scrapped, they cut the wings off and they destroyed all the simulators.
[12:30:28.920 --> 12:30:39.920]  But by an amazing coincidence, they were then replaced by three Boeing RC-135 aircraft worth £650 million.
[12:30:39.920 --> 12:30:43.920]  And those aircraft came from L3.
[12:30:43.920 --> 12:30:56.920]  So you can see that there was wheeling and dealing going on with absolutely massive UK defence contracts that were being done through the back door by Mr. Warrity
[12:30:56.920 --> 12:31:00.920]  and his organisation Pargav and Pargav Ltd.
[12:31:00.920 --> 12:31:13.920]  So the major press, which has convinced people in Britain that it's a little bit of maybe slap and tickle between Mr. Fox and his best man,
[12:31:13.920 --> 12:31:20.920]  this is a smokescreen because what has gone on in the background is absolutely massive arms deals.
[12:31:20.920 --> 12:31:30.920]  But of course, it's also exposed that David Cameron has been levered into power by international arms dealers.
[12:31:30.920 --> 12:31:36.920]  And I mean, as you said, this just opened up a can of worms that never ends.
[12:31:36.920 --> 12:31:43.920]  There was another group which was connected to this scandal, which I mentioned at the start.
[12:31:43.920 --> 12:31:53.920]  You had Warrity, of course, with Atlantic Bridge, but Atlantic Bridge, one of its main funders, is this Israeli bi-com lobbyist groups.
[12:31:53.920 --> 12:31:59.920]  And from what I can see, no mainstream establishment newspaper has done a story on this.
[12:31:59.920 --> 12:32:09.920]  A astounding revelation which came out in a leaked email which was mistakenly sent by bi-com CEO, this Israeli lobby group, to the press.
[12:32:09.920 --> 12:32:20.920]  And in this email, Brian, they brazenly boast about how they've penetrated BBC news and Sky News as a means of, quote,
[12:32:20.920 --> 12:32:29.920]  ensuring the most objectively favourable line was taken, end quote, in relation to a pro-Israeli stance in the news.
[12:32:29.920 --> 12:32:33.920]  Here's another quote in this leaked email.
[12:32:33.920 --> 12:32:44.920]  After contact with bi-com media team, Sky News changed their narrative in explaining the prior events in the region which led up to this weekend.
[12:32:44.920 --> 12:32:48.920]  And they're talking about the siege on the Israeli embassy back in September.
[12:32:48.920 --> 12:33:01.920]  So this group that funds Warrity's Atlantic Bridge in their own emails brag about how, I mean, there's another one where they talk about they have a meeting with the BBC news editor.
[12:33:01.920 --> 12:33:09.920]  There's another quote where they say, quote, I briefed Jonathan Ford, the Financial Times lead writer for his upcoming article.
[12:33:09.920 --> 12:33:13.920]  I briefed him. It's not that they gave him a quote or an interview.
[12:33:13.920 --> 12:33:20.920]  This lobby group is briefing our journalist, BBC Sky News Financial Times, on what to report.
[12:33:20.920 --> 12:33:25.920]  And they brag about how they made them change their narrative about certain events.
[12:33:25.920 --> 12:33:28.920]  And this is the group linked to Warrity's Atlantic Bridge.
[12:33:28.920 --> 12:33:32.920]  So, I mean, Brian, we've caught them red-handed.
[12:33:32.920 --> 12:33:36.920]  This is how talking points in the media are generated.
[12:33:36.920 --> 12:33:39.920]  It's about how they dictate reality to us.
[12:33:39.920 --> 12:33:49.920]  So, I mean, what does this say about the so-called impartiality of the likes of the BBC and Sky News that they're being briefed by pro-Israeli lobby groups?
[12:33:49.920 --> 12:33:52.920]  Well, this is absolutely correct.
[12:33:52.920 --> 12:33:58.920]  I'd just like to say at this point, because I think it is an important thing to talk about.
[12:33:58.920 --> 12:34:03.920]  We're here talking about Israeli interest.
[12:34:03.920 --> 12:34:12.920]  The principal interest for us is what our own ministers are doing into mixing with these people.
[12:34:12.920 --> 12:34:21.920]  I can at the moment just sort of put a wall down and say, the Israeli separate country, whatever they want to do, they can get on and do it.
[12:34:21.920 --> 12:34:23.920]  We may not agree with all of it.
[12:34:23.920 --> 12:34:33.920]  But at the moment in Britain, we are focusing on what our own politicians are doing being bought or directed by these people.
[12:34:33.920 --> 12:34:48.920]  When I have voted in national elections, I don't ever remember voting on a basis that I wanted people who were actually working for Israel coming into my country.
[12:34:48.920 --> 12:35:00.920]  Now, the key man in this, Mr. Zabludavit, was the man who was intimately linked with the British Israel Communications and Research Centre.
[12:35:00.920 --> 12:35:04.920]  And he donated some 800,000 pounds to them.
[12:35:04.920 --> 12:35:09.920]  So, we're not talking about small institutions who are short of a bit of money.
[12:35:09.920 --> 12:35:15.920]  We're talking about people who are directing sums of billions of pounds or billions of dollars.
[12:35:15.920 --> 12:35:21.920]  And they are capable of buying whole organizations and governments.
[12:35:21.920 --> 12:35:23.920]  Never mind a few individual people.
[12:35:23.920 --> 12:35:33.920]  But if you dig into Bicom, you very quickly find Mr. Fox's smiling face at their events.
[12:35:33.920 --> 12:35:45.920]  And the other important thing to realize is that this activity is not related to one party, it's not related to the British Conservative Party,
[12:35:45.920 --> 12:35:54.920]  because we've got individuals like Hazel Blair's MP from the Labour side who's also intimately involved with them.
[12:35:54.920 --> 12:36:05.920]  In fact, I can also say that Michael Goh, who's now our Education Secretary, is another man who is happy to come under the Bicom fold.
[12:36:05.920 --> 12:36:16.920]  So, I think that what we're really starting to ask is who are these people who are now in our parliament and who are they working for?
[12:36:16.920 --> 12:36:30.920]  And the UK column, we did it as a very measured article that we ran an article which pointed out that David Cameron said that he would never break his allegiance to Israel.
[12:36:30.920 --> 12:36:33.920]  That was above everything.
[12:36:33.920 --> 12:36:43.920]  And so we said to him, can you explain to us, Mr. Cameron, how you can be the Prime Minister of Britain, which should be your ultimate responsibility?
[12:36:43.920 --> 12:36:48.920]  And in fact, what you're saying is that your primary responsibility is to Israel.
[12:36:48.920 --> 12:36:57.920]  I believe that what we are seeing, well, I'm sure what we're seeing in the British Parliament at the moment, is utter treason.
[12:36:57.920 --> 12:37:06.920]  And we need to expose these people for what they really are, which is the spawn of international arms dealers.
[12:37:06.920 --> 12:37:16.920]  And of course, what do international arms dealers like? And it's very simple, they like wars and bloodsheds because that's how they make their profit.
[12:37:16.920 --> 12:37:33.920]  So, to now see this, I can't really describe it in the right way, this horrible man, Cameron, calling on America to start yet another war to start millions of deaths.
[12:37:33.920 --> 12:37:49.920]  I hope that the average American citizen out there and certainly the people listening to this show start to think to themselves, we don't need American deaths in order to satisfy Mr. Cameron's personal ambitions.
[12:37:49.920 --> 12:37:58.920]  It's amazing. And I mean, you talk about, you know, we don't vote for people to be influenced by Israeli lobbyists.
[12:37:58.920 --> 12:38:06.920]  It doesn't matter what country they come from, Russian lobbyists, any kind of outside influence whatsoever, it's a violation of sovereignty.
[12:38:06.920 --> 12:38:12.920]  It's the complete opposite of representational democracy and it's got no business being in our country.
[12:38:12.920 --> 12:38:18.920]  I mean, this, this Lorna Fitzsimmons of this BiCom group, she bragged it.
[12:38:18.920 --> 12:38:24.920]  I mean, these quotes just keep coming, quote, public opinion does not influence foreign policy in Britain.
[12:38:24.920 --> 12:38:30.920]  Foreign policy is an elite issue. So that again goes to the core of what you're saying with these people.
[12:38:30.920 --> 12:38:37.920]  Outsiders coming in and directing our foreign policy at odds to what the British people actually want.
[12:38:37.920 --> 12:38:46.920]  Switching gears, Brian, though. And I want to get on to the child abuse issue in a moment, but we had this big story a couple of months ago.
[12:38:46.920 --> 12:38:56.920]  What do you think about YouTube pulling down the video of the protest at Birkenhead where members of your group attempt to arrest the judge due to a quote,
[12:38:56.920 --> 12:39:02.920]  government removal request. That's what YouTube said and they pulled the video.
[12:39:02.920 --> 12:39:18.920]  Well, just to just to set the scene for listeners, a few months ago, in a totally peaceful demonstration, 600 people on the streets in the up in the Midlands in the UK.
[12:39:18.920 --> 12:39:24.920]  Basically, a judge was arrested for running an unlawful court.
[12:39:24.920 --> 12:39:31.920]  Now, of course, the police did what what we would expect to the police, which is that the police ended up defending the judge.
[12:39:31.920 --> 12:39:34.920]  He wasn't harmed. He wasn't assaulted anyway.
[12:39:34.920 --> 12:39:42.920]  But he was simply informed he was being put under arrest by the public because he was running an unlawful court.
[12:39:42.920 --> 12:39:52.920]  Now, you're quite right because video footage of that was taken down with a statement that it was the government taking it down.
[12:39:52.920 --> 12:39:59.920]  This is highly significant. I personally believe it. It's wonderful. It's excellent.
[12:39:59.920 --> 12:40:13.920]  Because what it has shown and people understand the meaning is the government is terrified of what people can do when they they've got proper knowledge and understanding of what's happening in their country.
[12:40:13.920 --> 12:40:25.920]  So the British government was so terrified of what 600 peaceful protesters did in Birkenhead near Liverpool that they had to remove the video.
[12:40:25.920 --> 12:40:43.920]  Of course, on the day itself, despite 600 people being on the streets, about 40 police vehicles, I don't know how many hundred police with dog handlers and some riot police in the background.
[12:40:43.920 --> 12:40:57.920]  On the day there was not a single report in any of the British mainstream media. The BBC didn't cover it. None of the ITV, the independent channels covered it.
[12:40:57.920 --> 12:41:03.920]  There was simply one local radio station that published what had happened.
[12:41:03.920 --> 12:41:13.920]  Now, this was obviously a media clampdown. And why would you need a media clampdown?
[12:41:13.920 --> 12:41:27.920]  Because the government is terrified of the truth coming out about the corruption in British courts and the fact that ordinary people are now starting to move to sort the problem out themselves.
[12:41:27.920 --> 12:41:29.920]  So that's what it's about.
[12:41:29.920 --> 12:41:39.920]  As you said, I mean, it just represents to me how much of a blind panic they're in that they have to remove this video from the Internet.
[12:41:39.920 --> 12:41:47.920]  And their excuse is, oh, you can't show footage of a, you know, a court in session. I mean, the court wasn't even in session.
[12:41:47.920 --> 12:41:53.920]  Most of the video was of the protest outside. So again, that was just an excuse.
[12:41:53.920 --> 12:42:06.920]  I mean, doesn't it show the fact that they're petrified of people understanding how in this example, Roger Hayes with the whole council tax issue, people can beat them at their own game.
[12:42:06.920 --> 12:42:19.920]  And I mean, that's that really goes to the heart of why they're so afraid, because if everyone else learns about how people are being successful in fighting it, then it's rapidly going to get out of control from their perspective.
[12:42:19.920 --> 12:42:29.920]  I think, Paul, but I know the Alex Jones show is pushing out a lot of good information, people about what is actually happening, and we are trying to do the same.
[12:42:29.920 --> 12:42:34.920]  But I think something very, very interesting has happened in the last six months.
[12:42:34.920 --> 12:42:47.920]  You can now feel, you can see if you're looking in the right place, that we are starting, we, this is all the people, thousands, millions, millions of people who are starting to wake up.
[12:42:47.920 --> 12:42:55.920]  We are now starting to drive our own governments, because they also know people are waking up.
[12:42:55.920 --> 12:43:08.920]  And that is why we are suddenly seeing the rush through of all this very hard hitting draconian legislation to clamp down on American people and to clamp down on British people.
[12:43:08.920 --> 12:43:17.920]  They are now going flat out to introduce the dictatorships in Britain and America.
[12:43:17.920 --> 12:43:24.920]  And the reason they're having to rush is because of the rate we are now exposing what they're doing.
[12:43:24.920 --> 12:43:36.920]  And the beauty is, the more they do, and the faster they do it, the more obvious it is to people that something is very wrong.
[12:43:36.920 --> 12:43:49.920]  So I think we, as well as getting out the message of all the terrible things that are happening at the moment, we've also very much got to focus on the positive things and where we're having success is.
[12:43:49.920 --> 12:44:02.920]  And one of the things that we know in Britain is we can't get justice, we can't bring treasonous politicians to justice, because the courts are utterly corrupt.
[12:44:02.920 --> 12:44:23.920]  And one British MP called John Heming, who came to an event we put on last weekend, sorry, the weekend before last, was happy to stand on stage and be filled saying that the British courts and judiciary are corrupt.
[12:44:23.920 --> 12:44:37.920]  So we've got to deal with these corrupt courts and these corrupt judges if we are going to get democracy and proper law and order restored in our country.
[12:44:37.920 --> 12:44:48.920]  And that tipping point is going to be more likely, the number of insiders like the MP you just mentioned come out and speak out against that.
[12:44:48.920 --> 12:45:01.920]  I mean, readers of the UK column are well aware of switching gears for the next topic, the fact that you've covered this serial state kidnapping of children for years now.
[12:45:01.920 --> 12:45:08.920]  And for our American audience, if you think the CPS is bad in the United States, then this certainly rivals it.
[12:45:08.920 --> 12:45:21.920]  We're talking about no court order, barely any legal process in many cases, police from the stories I read, literally hunting down cars in the middle of the night to snatch babies from parents.
[12:45:21.920 --> 12:45:31.920]  I mean, Brian, we've read cases in the media about, you know, taking so-called obese children from parents and the media will report on that length.
[12:45:31.920 --> 12:45:46.920]  But what you've reported in the UK column is something that could only represent a deliberate assault on the family unit by the state with these kind of child kidnappings, child abduction and eventually child abuse.
[12:45:46.920 --> 12:45:51.920]  I mean, tell us why this is happening in the UK and why it's so prevalent.
[12:45:51.920 --> 12:46:10.920]  Well, you've made that very easy for me because all we have to do is bring listeners back and get them focused on Saul and Linsky in particular and also Gromsky, who is an Italian Marxist.
[12:46:10.920 --> 12:46:12.920]  You don't need to read huge books.
[12:46:12.920 --> 12:46:16.920]  You can go on the Internet and just Google both of them.
[12:46:16.920 --> 12:46:36.920]  And what you will find these men talking about is getting in to destroy traditional democracies, to destroy traditional communities by getting in and destroying families and particularly Christian families.
[12:46:36.920 --> 12:46:52.920]  And their tactics are instead of guns and balls and bullets, you actually infiltrate into the establishment, the system itself, and then you do the damage from the inside.
[12:46:52.920 --> 12:47:15.920]  But the family unit, the heterosexual family unit was always their primary target because if you can break up mothers and fathers, moms and dads, and you can take the children, then those children can be groomed straight into the new political ideology.
[12:47:15.920 --> 12:47:33.920]  And what we've got to do is put the scale of this. Remember that Britain is a much smaller country than America, but we're dealing at the moment with over 60,000 children who actually have been taken away from their parents.
[12:47:33.920 --> 12:47:46.920]  The children are being taken inside courts where there are no juries, where the press is not allowed to be. So these are secret courts.
[12:47:46.920 --> 12:47:52.920]  The star chamber is the correct word in Britain for them. They are secret courts.
[12:47:52.920 --> 12:48:05.920]  The evidence brought in is falsified. Psychiatrist reports, psychologist reports contain lies, false information. They are factually incorrect.
[12:48:05.920 --> 12:48:11.920]  And it doesn't matter what the parents do inside the court, their children are taken from them.
[12:48:11.920 --> 12:48:31.920]  And again, we know that the government in the UK is beginning to get very fearful of the speed at which the information is coming out, because in the last two days a gentleman called David Norgrove has published his report on family justice.
[12:48:31.920 --> 12:48:45.920]  And he's actually saying that the whole process should be speeded up. In particular, he's saying that if a couple breaks up, the father should not have automatic access to his own children.
[12:48:45.920 --> 12:49:02.920]  And he's also saying, this man, that grandparents who actually get involved when couples break up and say, we can look after the children, that those grandparents are actually doing damage to the children and they should be cut out.
[12:49:02.920 --> 12:49:09.920]  Now, David Cameron, let's stay focused on David Cameron because this man is so dangerous.
[12:49:09.920 --> 12:49:19.920]  David Cameron, the Prime Minister of Britain, is backing a report which says that fathers should be denied access to their children.
[12:49:19.920 --> 12:49:30.920]  This is the work of Gromsky. And of course, David Cameron is not a conservative in any shape or form. He is a subversive.
[12:49:30.920 --> 12:49:40.920]  I personally regard him as a domestic extremist and what he is doing is implanting Gromsky ideology.
[12:49:40.920 --> 12:49:55.920]  So this is why we're having such an amazing attack on families and thousands and thousands of children are being taken away, because if we can break down the family, then the state can claim the children.
[12:49:55.920 --> 12:49:58.920]  It's as simple as that.
[12:49:58.920 --> 12:50:05.920]  I mean, this goes to the very heart of broken Britain, which is this phrase we hear constantly.
[12:50:05.920 --> 12:50:14.920]  Most people don't realise that it's being deliberately broken. If it's broken, then somebody's going to put it back together again and you can bet that that's going to be the state.
[12:50:14.920 --> 12:50:22.920]  And a shining example of what it leads to is what we witnessed in the UK back in August, which was the riots.
[12:50:22.920 --> 12:50:31.920]  Now, I'm guessing, Brian, that came as a completely expected to you. I mean, your newspaper has been predicting widespread social unrest.
[12:50:31.920 --> 12:50:42.920]  I predicted it in articles I wrote two years ago. So I'm guessing that the riots which started in London and spread across major cities back in August didn't come as a surprise to you.
[12:50:42.920 --> 12:51:00.920]  Well, absolutely not. And it was very easy to see within a few hours, but certainly within 24 hours, that these were not spontaneous riots from people who'd had enough.
[12:51:00.920 --> 12:51:08.920]  It just didn't stack up. We know how difficult it is to organise people across the country.
[12:51:08.920 --> 12:51:24.920]  And here we have the British government saying that riots were being organised in not only London, but other cities across the UK, that these riots were being organised by young black teenagers using blackberry phones.
[12:51:24.920 --> 12:51:32.920]  This is absolutely nonsense. What was actually happening was the violence was being created by government agitators.
[12:51:32.920 --> 12:51:50.920]  And we also know from residents in some of the areas where the riots took place that they watched police deliberately held back so that they didn't intervene and the thing then grew, that the trouble on the streets grew.
[12:51:50.920 --> 12:51:57.920]  So somebody was ordering the police, let's stand back, let's allow this thing to grow, let's kick it off.
[12:51:57.920 --> 12:52:17.920]  And we've got better information than that because some British policemen, and these are brilliant people because they're so brave, they have actually been leaking information that when they were taken into an area where the rioting had started,
[12:52:17.920 --> 12:52:30.920]  they saw other so-called police units who they didn't recognise. They had no idea what units these really were. They had no idea where the people had come from.
[12:52:30.920 --> 12:52:40.920]  And in many cases they were talking about so-called policemen who didn't have any formal number or name identity on them.
[12:52:40.920 --> 12:52:58.920]  So we have British policemen who are themselves now starting to blow the whistle on the fact that when there is trouble on the streets, there are agitators who are being moved into position via our own policing system.
[12:52:58.920 --> 12:53:12.920]  So this is very, very dangerous because we have now got government-backed agitation. And if listeners are thinking, you know, where do they want to take this, I'll give my opinion.
[12:53:12.920 --> 12:53:32.920]  So this is just Brian Garrish's opinion on this one. They want absolute major violence on the streets of Britain because if they can create that major violence, they will bring in the Civil Contingencies Act, which is roughly equivalent to the American Patriot Act.
[12:53:32.920 --> 12:53:51.920]  The moment the Civil Contingencies Act is in place, we are living in a dictatorship. So whenever we are giving talks as the UK column or the British Constitution Group, we are constantly warning that we need people to be peaceful.
[12:53:51.920 --> 12:54:12.920]  We don't need fights between blacks and whites or Muslims or Christians, whatever the groups are. If we fight amongst ourselves, the criminals who are in power in the Senate, in America and Congress and in Westminster and Britain, those criminals will win.
[12:54:12.920 --> 12:54:25.920]  We've got to be smarter than violence at the moment. We've got to keep it calm and peaceful and we've got to get the truth out about how our countries are being destroyed from the inside.
[12:54:25.920 --> 12:54:44.920]  And I mean, just to bite you up, we actually did a story in regard to the riots where Twitter users were reporting that men claiming to represent the media were actually driving around the streets and paying them to riot, paying them to break shop windows.
[12:54:44.920 --> 12:54:56.920]  As you said, paying them to become agitators. So I mean, those riots, obviously after it went on the social meme and it was on the news every night, it had copycats going out and doing the same thing.
[12:54:56.920 --> 12:55:03.920]  But the genesis of those riots, as you said, was definitely provocative in many ways.
[12:55:03.920 --> 12:55:20.920]  Extrapolating this out, just about the general state of Britain, Brian, perhaps the best way to frame that is to ask, what do groups like Common Purpose want to turn Britain into and how far have they got down that path?
[12:55:20.920 --> 12:55:35.920]  Well, very simply, Common Purpose wants to create a new society. It doesn't ever define the society properly because this is how the con works.
[12:55:35.920 --> 12:55:51.920]  If you said to people, join Common Purpose and we are working to overturn present society and we want to create a new society that's going to be governed by a political elite, most people would run away.
[12:55:51.920 --> 12:56:06.920]  So what Common Purpose is doing is being very, very devious, it's sucking people into courses where it's giving them an education to impose this new ideology on them.
[12:56:06.920 --> 12:56:21.920]  And we know how it is being done and I really would ask listeners to go away and research this for themselves. The way they are doing it is to use NLP, neurolinguistic programming.
[12:56:21.920 --> 12:56:42.920]  This is a form, technically it's a form of hypnosis, but these are very, very sophisticated techniques of messing around with people's minds and although NLP can be used to help people, it can be used in therapeutic ways,
[12:56:42.920 --> 12:56:57.920]  what we are seeing is NLP being used to promote a very dangerous political agenda and it's being used to change people's views and values without them actually being aware of it.
[12:56:57.920 --> 12:57:15.920]  Now if you say to me how bad has it got, I'm going to be able to say with total confidence because the UK column has published this stuff in detail. We've now got Common Purpose embedded at the highest level of government.
[12:57:15.920 --> 12:57:30.920]  One of Cameron's ministers who's helping promote it is Oliver Letwin, who I'll say just happens to be an ex-MN Rothschild man, but we've got Common Purpose, which is a political charity.
[12:57:30.920 --> 12:57:36.920]  I know that I've already said earlier that it's not possible to be political, but I'm sure they are.
[12:57:36.920 --> 12:57:53.920]  They are now bedded straight into the government cabinet office and they have been put under contract to help set up behavioural change units in every government department.
[12:57:53.920 --> 12:58:01.920]  Now this is not fantasy, this is fact. We've got the documents, we know the names, we know when the meetings took place.
[12:58:01.920 --> 12:58:16.920]  So in the UK at the moment, every key government department has a cell which is tasked first of all with changing the views and values and behaviour of the government department people.
[12:58:16.920 --> 12:58:27.920]  And when they've achieved that, the departments are going to use the same effects on us to change our views and values in society.
[12:58:27.920 --> 12:58:37.920]  Now the government's own documents, and I'll quote one of them which is called Mind Space, Mind Space, you can find it on Google,
[12:58:37.920 --> 12:58:49.920]  in that document it actually admits that the psychological process they're using, the NLP they're using, can change our views and values and beliefs.
[12:58:49.920 --> 12:59:07.920]  We may not even know that those things have been changed. These modern applied psychology tools are so powerful we can have our views changed, we're not even aware of the views changed.
[12:59:07.920 --> 12:59:15.920]  Alternatively, we might realise we've changed, we're doing different things, but we don't know how it was done to us.
[12:59:15.920 --> 12:59:23.920]  Now that's not Brian Garrish telling the audience that, that has come straight out of government documents.
[12:59:23.920 --> 12:59:35.920]  So let's start to put this together. We've got in Britain, and the same thing's happening in America, we have international criminals who have now wormed their way.
[12:59:35.920 --> 12:59:45.920]  We've been stupid enough to elect them, but they're now in positions of power in government, they're linked to arms dealers, they're calling for wars throughout the world,
[12:59:45.920 --> 13:00:00.920]  and these people are prepared to use applied psychology on their own citizens in order to get their agenda through. This is very, very dangerous stuff, and we've got to take the lid off it.
[13:00:00.920 --> 13:00:08.920]  NLP, which you were talking about before, goes right to the heart of what you just said. It's about manipulating behaviour.
[13:00:08.920 --> 13:00:16.920]  It's about certain phrases and emphasis on words, and this is used in advertising, it's used in speeches, it's used in politics,
[13:00:16.920 --> 13:00:24.920]  and it's about trying to get people to do what you want them to do, get them to think what you want them to think by the words that you use.
[13:00:24.920 --> 13:00:32.920]  It's sold as a self-help tool, and I'm sure a lot of people do use it for that, but it's been hijacked and it's now being used for nefarious ends.
[13:00:32.920 --> 13:00:50.920]  Paul, can I, sorry to interrupt, but if I may, because I'm watching the time, something I'd like to bring to the attention of the American audience is that in South Wales, being obviously part of the United Kingdom,
[13:00:50.920 --> 13:01:04.920]  over the last two years, in a very small geographic area, we now have over 40 teenagers, very young teenagers, and young people committing suicide.
[13:01:04.920 --> 13:01:22.920]  It's been going on for two years, the suicides are still continuing, and what is so terrible is these are children aged 15, 14, 15, 16, and up through to sort of young 20s,
[13:01:22.920 --> 13:01:32.920]  and the method of suicide is that they are all hanging themselves. Now, this is not a very nice topic, but we're in very dangerous times at the moment.
[13:01:32.920 --> 13:01:49.920]  When we look at the suicides and we see they're all hanging themselves, this is unusual, because the facts are, statistically, that boys normally hang themselves or men hang themselves, whereas girls and women take drugs and maybe cut their wrists.
[13:01:49.920 --> 13:02:01.920]  But these people are all hanging themselves. Now, at the moment, the British government has put a media clamp down on these suicides because they do not want people in Britain to realise that something very,
[13:02:01.920 --> 13:02:17.920]  very nasty is happening with young people. But when we dig into what is actually happening in this area of South Wales, we find there is a massive infiltration of not only common purpose,
[13:02:17.920 --> 13:02:37.920]  but other organisations which are using applied NLP within the school system. Now, I can speak with confidence on this because we actually now have NLP trainers, people who are professional trainers in NLP,
[13:02:37.920 --> 13:02:53.920]  they have come forward to us to give us information because they are absolutely horrified that what they regard as a therapeutic skill is being unleashed on children in a political sense.
[13:02:53.920 --> 13:03:11.920]  Now, what one of these professional NLP people explained to me, and I think it's a very, very good analogy, if you buy yourself a new computer and it's a very fast machine and you're very pleased with it, this is like the human brain, it's working well.
[13:03:11.920 --> 13:03:28.920]  And then you add a program and everything's fine and you add a few more programs and then you fancy a game and you add a couple of computer games. And after you've added so many things into your computer, eventually you get the odd problem, it freezes or it stops.
[13:03:28.920 --> 13:03:41.920]  And if you really overload it with lots of little screensavers and games and programs, eventually you can have major problems with your computer until you get it cleaned out.
[13:03:41.920 --> 13:04:02.920]  Now, what the NLP trainer explained to me is that if you start to put in NLP clips, NLP programs into the minds of children and young people, you do a bit in this lesson, a bit in that lesson, a bit in next year's lesson, eventually you get problems.
[13:04:02.920 --> 13:04:20.920]  And his view, and I think he's absolutely correct, is that we are now starting to see the political pushing of applied behavioural psychology. This is now starting to result in our young people committing suicide.
[13:04:20.920 --> 13:04:27.920]  This is very dangerous stuff and exactly the same processes are being used in American schools.
[13:04:27.920 --> 13:04:49.920]  And it's interesting you touch upon that subject because a couple of weeks ago I wrote an article about Demos, which of course is the think tank of which Cameron regularly gives speeches, so did Tony Blair, founded by Marxist, Julian Middleton, who of course is majorly involved with common purpose, sits on their board.
[13:04:49.920 --> 13:05:07.920]  And there was a story recently about Demos sending their agents out to schools to basically train them how to judge sources. And of course anything designated as a quote conspiracy theory, anything that disagrees with the official orthodoxy, was denigrated and rubbish.
[13:05:07.920 --> 13:05:22.920]  So they're actually sending out Demos people to train school children to dismiss anything that goes against the government line. And we actually had one of the Demos employees on the Alex Jones Nightly News after.
[13:05:22.920 --> 13:05:37.920]  And of course he denied everything. From my perspective it seemed like he was just working at the lower level. He's got no idea what the overall organisation is about, although he did admit that Demos is funded by the British government.
[13:05:37.920 --> 13:05:46.920]  So of course that's going to have an influence on what they're allowed to do and what kind of programmes they're allowed to bring to schools and introduce to the curriculum.
[13:05:46.920 --> 13:06:02.920]  But one more thing, Brian, we've got a few minutes before we end here. It's interesting that we did an article on these common purpose promo videos, which were on YouTube a couple of years ago, really downright creepy stuff.
[13:06:02.920 --> 13:06:13.920]  They had shots of, they were talking about common purpose, then they cut to shots of people involved in the programme. You know, wide-eyed looked completely drugged out of their gourds, looked like they were brainwashed.
[13:06:13.920 --> 13:06:21.920]  I wrote an article saying, look at this, this is weird, this is creepy. Lo and behold, the YouTube account related to these videos has now been deleted.
[13:06:21.920 --> 13:06:29.920]  So they seem, I mean, common purpose had a thing on their website recently saying, you know, attacking you basically saying what you say is all rubbish.
[13:06:29.920 --> 13:06:38.920]  But it's very interesting when you point out these things, they seem to get very nervous and start to remove material. Is that the case from what you're experience?
[13:06:38.920 --> 13:06:49.920]  Yeah, that is absolutely correct. But let's look at this on a positive side. If these people have nothing to hide, they should be very proud of all their material up.
[13:06:49.920 --> 13:06:59.920]  The fact that when you lift the stone, you shine the spotlight on them, that they start to backtrack, instantly tells you they're up to no good.
[13:06:59.920 --> 13:07:09.920]  So I'm delighted when stuff gets taken down because what the government is doing for free is telling us that we're beginning to look in the right areas.
[13:07:09.920 --> 13:07:15.920]  We're beginning to look in the right direction and just come back to Demos very quickly.
[13:07:15.920 --> 13:07:24.920]  I'm really glad that you mentioned Demos is a Marxist organisation and it is right next to the British government.
[13:07:24.920 --> 13:07:41.920]  It's a policy creation think tank. It has advised Labour, it's advised the Liberal Democrats and now it's interwoven into the so-called Conservative government.
[13:07:41.920 --> 13:07:46.920]  And yes, you're absolutely right, Julia Middleton linked to Demos.
[13:07:46.920 --> 13:08:02.920]  So everywhere we now turn, where the country Britain and America is being ripped apart, it's being done because the Marxist ideology has been let loose inside the country.
[13:08:02.920 --> 13:08:15.920]  Well, we've got very, very brave American men and women serving their country in the American armed forces and they think they're out there on the front line defending their country.
[13:08:15.920 --> 13:08:28.920]  What is actually going on is that the Marxists have put their people in power, straight into Congress, straight into the Senate and in Britain, straight into Westminster.
[13:08:28.920 --> 13:08:37.920]  We know who these people are. In Britain we certainly know who they are and all we've got to do is remove them.
[13:08:37.920 --> 13:08:48.920]  Is it possible? I'm going to say it's going to start to happen very quickly and the beauty of it is that initially I think things will get a little bit ugly,
[13:08:48.920 --> 13:08:56.920]  but the longer we keep it peaceful, the faster the truth comes out and the quicker these people start running.
[13:08:56.920 --> 13:09:08.920]  You only had to see the fear on Liam Fox's face when he started to be exposed in the press. So if you want to know how to hurt these people, how to get rid of them,
[13:09:08.920 --> 13:09:19.920]  you've got to name them, you've got to get their photographs into the media, onto the internet and we've got to name them for what they are.
[13:09:19.920 --> 13:09:31.920]  They are dangerous criminals, they're Marxists, many of them are child abusers, certainly in the British political circles and we need to expose them for what they really are.
[13:09:31.920 --> 13:09:37.920]  If we do that, we can overcome what's happening.
[13:09:37.920 --> 13:09:47.920]  And just to conclude, Brian, give people the websites, tell them how they can get involved with the British Constitution Group, UK Column, etc.
[13:09:47.920 --> 13:09:58.920]  OK, well the UK Column is a newspaper, it's a voluntary newspaper, but we're reporting on what's happening in the country and we're analysing it.
[13:09:58.920 --> 13:10:23.920]  And that is simply www.ukcolumn.org. The British Constitution Group, which is showing how our common law and constitution is being undermined,
[13:10:23.920 --> 13:10:38.920]  is www.vbcgroup, or one word, vbcgroup.org.uk.
[13:10:38.920 --> 13:10:57.920]  If you go to either of those sites, you'll start to see what we're about. And if you're interested in common purpose, I've another site which is called cpxposed.com, www.cpxposed.com.
[13:10:57.920 --> 13:11:10.920]  That is going to get a big update fairly shortly, but there's a lot of information on common purpose. And can I just lastly say that this coming Saturday, the British Constitution Group has got a big talk in London,
[13:11:10.920 --> 13:11:32.920]  in which we are going to be exposing the traitors in Westminster. And in the evening at half past five, there are big demonstrations planned by Anonymous and Occupy London, and these are people who have now decided to come out on the streets
[13:11:32.920 --> 13:11:48.920]  and protest against the criminals in Parliament. So I doubt if much of it will come out on mainstream press, but I hope Paul and Alex, the Alex Jones show, will cover some of that event.
[13:11:48.920 --> 13:12:03.920]  Okay, Brian Garrish, we'll get this interview on YouTube, be seen by tens of thousands of people, we'll get the information out. Really appreciate you joining me this morning, and you've got my email address as soon as you want to come on again, just shoot me an email,
[13:12:03.920 --> 13:12:07.920]  and we'll get you on again with Alex. Brian Garrish, thank you very much.
[13:12:07.920 --> 13:12:26.920]  Thank you. Okay, there goes Brian Garrish, UKcolon.org. We're going to go to a video now before we get our next guest on, and this is an event in London of which Brian Garrish was a speaker concerning the state child abduction issue.
[13:12:26.920 --> 13:12:38.920]  I believe it was in Trafalgar Square, so we're going to go to this interview for a few minutes, then we're going to come back with our guest, and we're going to get a bit weird, it's going to be a topic that's rarely covered on the Alex Jones show,
[13:12:38.920 --> 13:13:00.920]  but we're going to get Tony topping on UFO research, we're going to cover a host of controversial subjects. So now we go to this Brian Garrish clip, stay tuned, info was moneybomb.com, we'll be back in a few minutes.
[13:13:00.920 --> 13:13:24.920]  I didn't believe it, until families, mums, dads, partners, began to bring documentation which showed overwhelmingly, and without any doubt, that what we were seeing happen in courts, was that children were being taken away from their parents.
[13:13:24.920 --> 13:13:35.920]  And some of you will be thinking, well they must have done something wrong, they must have hurt their children, or they must have been dangerous, or they must have had mental illness.
[13:13:35.920 --> 13:14:04.920]  Well certainly for some families that's true, but what began to interest us is when we started to see that children were taken away from perfectly good loving mums and dads, on perjury, on false evidence, false accusations, false documentation, court documents with no official court stamp.
[13:14:04.920 --> 13:14:22.920]  And no signature by a judge. We started to find out that the police were collaborating with the courts and social services in order to take children away from their parents.
[13:14:22.920 --> 13:14:38.920]  And if you ask me what's happening to the children when they're taken away from their parents, they're being abused. And if you don't know what that means, it can mean that just psychological abuse, they've given a rough time.
[13:14:38.920 --> 13:14:57.920]  And for some of them it means they're sexually abused. And I didn't believe this either until I started to listen to some of these mums and dads and I started to look at the evidence. And then we started to realise that some of these children disappear into the system.
[13:14:57.920 --> 13:15:07.920]  And you may wonder how they can disappear. So I've got a question. Is the BBC present today?
[13:15:07.920 --> 13:15:08.920]  No.
[13:15:08.920 --> 13:15:12.920]  Are any of the major newspapers present today?
[13:15:12.920 --> 13:15:13.920]  No.
[13:15:13.920 --> 13:15:19.920]  Do we have any of the mainstream media present?
[13:15:19.920 --> 13:15:20.920]  No.
[13:15:20.920 --> 13:15:32.920]  So we have a rally in central London where people are warning that the children are being taken and there is not one single representative of mainstream media.
[13:15:32.920 --> 13:15:46.920]  Can I ask if there are any members of parliament here? Is Mr John Heming in the audience perhaps? Are there any MPs? Are there any councillors?
[13:15:46.920 --> 13:15:48.920]  Mr Heming gave his apology.
[13:15:48.920 --> 13:16:11.920]  I've just been told that Mr John Heming gave his apology. So I'll say he is a man who's starting to do some things. But the reason this is going on is because there is a massive media clamp down which says when we start to talk about what is happening to children and how they are being snatched by the state,
[13:16:11.920 --> 13:16:20.920]  you cannot get a single article into the papers. There is not a single documentary on mainstream TV.
[13:16:20.920 --> 13:16:31.920]  And if you want to know what's happening in the courts, you have to go into the court with the parents because the courts are secret courts.
[13:16:31.920 --> 13:16:44.920]  Never mind what the law lords say, Judge Judge and Mr Bumbie, if you look at what is happening in the family courts in Britain, they are secret courts.
[13:16:44.920 --> 13:16:58.920]  The public is not allowed in, there are no juries and the press, if they are allowed in at all, are told by the judges what they can and cannot report.
[13:16:58.920 --> 13:17:15.920]  These are unlawful courts. They are unlawful at common law under the British constitution and they are in fact administrative courts or statute law courts.
[13:17:15.920 --> 13:17:19.920]  And the fact there is a single judge who may...
[13:17:19.920 --> 13:17:26.920]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[13:17:26.920 --> 13:17:32.920]  As we are finishing off this agenda, we are pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[13:17:32.920 --> 13:17:38.920]  We have turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[13:17:38.920 --> 13:17:43.920]  I think it is incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[13:17:43.920 --> 13:17:53.920]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[13:17:53.920 --> 13:17:59.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they are arsonists. They are asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[13:17:59.920 --> 13:18:06.920]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[13:18:06.920 --> 13:18:24.920]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[13:18:52.920 --> 13:19:00.920]  The fire's burning, we lay our weapons down on the west
[13:19:00.920 --> 13:19:09.920]  This war ain't over, till all the people will be free
[13:19:09.920 --> 13:19:12.920]  Straight from our hearts, we'll grab it
[13:19:12.920 --> 13:19:20.920]  Welcome back, it's the Infowars Money Bomb Marathon Live, now approaching half ten in the UK.
[13:19:20.920 --> 13:19:26.920]  The guys in the office, some of them have had some sleep, some haven't. Alex Jones is going to be back soon.
[13:19:26.920 --> 13:19:43.920]  InfowarsMoneyBomb.com, I see we're already at 215,000, so we've got several hours left remaining of this 24 hour broadcast and we're hoping to get up there somewhere close to the 500,000 mark.
[13:19:43.920 --> 13:19:50.920]  I know a lot of the money isn't counted until after it comes in, so it's really important that you support us.
[13:19:50.920 --> 13:20:07.920]  As I wrote in my article a few days ago, unlike media matters, unlike the big liberal leftist organisations, we don't get half a million dollar, five hundred thousand dollar, five million dollar checks from the likes of George Soros.
[13:20:07.920 --> 13:20:17.920]  We're not funded by the Carnegie Institute. We don't force people to pay license fees for content they may not even want with government backing it up like the BBC.
[13:20:17.920 --> 13:20:28.920]  So that's why we need your support. You've seen what we've done over the last year or so, built the TV studio, reaching, you know, conservatively, double the amount of people.
[13:20:28.920 --> 13:20:37.920]  Infowars.com gets more traffic than MSNBC.com. And yeah, we don't take handouts from General Electric.
[13:20:37.920 --> 13:20:41.920]  So how have we managed to get more traffic than MSNBC.com?
[13:20:41.920 --> 13:20:47.920]  Well, because of your support in the last two money bombs, and that's why we need your support once again.
[13:20:47.920 --> 13:20:52.920]  Infowars.com.com to take the info war to the next level.
[13:20:52.920 --> 13:20:57.920]  I can't emphasise how much we're taking on the establishment and winning.
[13:20:57.920 --> 13:21:05.920]  We get more traffic than a lot of big news websites, establishment media funded by giant transnational corporations.
[13:21:05.920 --> 13:21:16.920]  That's got to be judged as a measure of success. And none of it, none of it would be possible without your support, which we've generously had over the past several years.
[13:21:16.920 --> 13:21:26.920]  So please go to infowarsmoneybomb.com and support the info war, which Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing and we're winning.
[13:21:26.920 --> 13:21:31.920]  Why? Because of your support, infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[13:21:31.920 --> 13:21:35.920]  Now we're going to plunge headfirst into a controversial topic.
[13:21:35.920 --> 13:21:43.920]  It's often speculative and nebulous, which is why we don't cover it too much on the Alex Jones show,
[13:21:43.920 --> 13:21:48.920]  what with all the other crises, scandals and cover-ups staring us in the face.
[13:21:48.920 --> 13:21:54.920]  But you know, if it's good enough for the likes of the History Channel, then why shouldn't we talk about it?
[13:21:54.920 --> 13:22:00.920]  And that of course is the ever controversial subject of UFOs and ufology.
[13:22:00.920 --> 13:22:08.920]  And to talk about this, we welcome UFO researcher Tony Topping, a man who's appeared on the likes of BBC Sky News Channel 4,
[13:22:08.920 --> 13:22:14.920]  and is in fact Talksports resident ufologist to discuss this fascinating subject.
[13:22:14.920 --> 13:22:17.920]  Tony, welcome to the Alex Jones show this morning.
[13:22:17.920 --> 13:22:20.920]  Oh, well, welcome. Welcome, Paul. And thank you very much indeed.
[13:22:20.920 --> 13:22:23.920]  Sincere thanks for having me come on there.
[13:22:23.920 --> 13:22:28.920]  There are lots of people who come on the Alex Jones show discussing lots of subjects.
[13:22:28.920 --> 13:22:32.920]  And so I feel very humbled that you chose me to come on the show.
[13:22:32.920 --> 13:22:40.920]  This morning, before I came on air, and we'll go into all that, I was once again harassed this morning.
[13:22:40.920 --> 13:22:44.920]  And what we're doing at Brian Garrish was talking about, I think, one level of a conspiracy.
[13:22:44.920 --> 13:22:49.920]  And I think we're going to click it up for the listeners in the US and in the UK,
[13:22:49.920 --> 13:22:53.920]  and talk about the conspiracy that is paranormal and where the two meet,
[13:22:53.920 --> 13:22:59.920]  and the UFO stuff and all that I've been subjected to, et cetera, et cetera, Paul.
[13:22:59.920 --> 13:23:03.920]  Well, just start off, Tony, by telling the audience about yourself,
[13:23:03.920 --> 13:23:08.920]  how you got involved in all this and why you think it's important.
[13:23:08.920 --> 13:23:10.920]  Yeah, well, this is absolutely right.
[13:23:10.920 --> 13:23:15.920]  I was, since early childhood, since the age of two,
[13:23:15.920 --> 13:23:21.920]  I had my first paranormal experience where something walked through a wall.
[13:23:21.920 --> 13:23:28.920]  And I remember at the age of two, being unable to decipher what I was seeing walking through that wall.
[13:23:28.920 --> 13:23:34.920]  And I was screaming at my father and pointing at the wall, and I still can see myself now doing this,
[13:23:34.920 --> 13:23:38.920]  even at two, I've got quite a visual memory, I can see this event happening.
[13:23:38.920 --> 13:23:41.920]  And my father going, oh, don't worry, there's nothing there.
[13:23:41.920 --> 13:23:44.920]  I remember the word now, there's nothing there, and he put me back in my cot.
[13:23:44.920 --> 13:23:51.920]  And since then, I had all kinds of paranormal experiences from the age of seven, eight into my teenage years.
[13:23:51.920 --> 13:23:53.920]  I doubled a bit into the occult.
[13:23:53.920 --> 13:24:00.920]  And it wasn't really until about 1991, before I went to drama school in London,
[13:24:00.920 --> 13:24:05.920]  that I had a UFO appear over the house, like something out of close encounters.
[13:24:05.920 --> 13:24:07.920]  It was there, it was gone.
[13:24:07.920 --> 13:24:11.920]  And I wondered why it was there, what its purpose was.
[13:24:11.920 --> 13:24:14.920]  I wondered for months about it as to what it was and did I really see it.
[13:24:14.920 --> 13:24:21.920]  And little would I know that these UFOs would start turning up and cause me to swallow a red pill,
[13:24:21.920 --> 13:24:24.920]  the like of which nobody has ever seen before.
[13:24:24.920 --> 13:24:31.920]  And would plunge me headlong into a situation that I really have taken some years to actually work out.
[13:24:31.920 --> 13:24:36.920]  It's taken some considerable time to suss out what has been going on.
[13:24:36.920 --> 13:24:39.920]  And so I went to stage school.
[13:24:39.920 --> 13:24:43.920]  Nothing really much happened at stage school until I left stage school.
[13:24:43.920 --> 13:24:46.920]  And I started working in London in an office.
[13:24:46.920 --> 13:24:49.920]  I'd gone to stage school in London and I started working in an office in London.
[13:24:49.920 --> 13:24:53.920]  And I started having my first UFO incident over Paddington in London.
[13:24:53.920 --> 13:24:58.920]  And then there was a string of successive flyovers of these objects.
[13:24:58.920 --> 13:25:00.920]  They kept appearing, they kept appearing.
[13:25:00.920 --> 13:25:02.920]  Later on little, I began filming them.
[13:25:02.920 --> 13:25:10.920]  And later on little was to I know that considerably years down the line from 1996 where that incident occurred in Paddington,
[13:25:10.920 --> 13:25:16.920]  that I would be attacked by them on two occasions, which is something we can go into later.
[13:25:16.920 --> 13:25:22.920]  But what basically happened is to cut a long story short, in 1999,
[13:25:22.920 --> 13:25:27.920]  connected with all the extraordinary paranormal experiences I was having,
[13:25:27.920 --> 13:25:33.920]  and I had a UFO come in over the house, over the estate, and illuminate a TV antenna.
[13:25:33.920 --> 13:25:35.920]  We took that for image analysis.
[13:25:35.920 --> 13:25:40.920]  The guy who did the image analysis said that that indeed was a UFO.
[13:25:40.920 --> 13:25:45.920]  And somebody who worked in Army Intelligence, who I used to work with,
[13:25:45.920 --> 13:25:50.920]  who commented to me, because I put a website up on the internet poll, which was frankly Bollocks,
[13:25:50.920 --> 13:25:54.920]  it was 1999 and I put this website up,
[13:25:54.920 --> 13:25:58.920]  and now talked about me assuming to know what was going on when I didn't.
[13:25:58.920 --> 13:26:01.920]  And as this guy said to me, that will attract people out of the woodwork.
[13:26:01.920 --> 13:26:05.920]  And sure enough, boy oh boy Paul, did they come out of the woodwork.
[13:26:05.920 --> 13:26:09.920]  I started getting phone calls, I started being followed,
[13:26:09.920 --> 13:26:14.920]  and I started being subjected to horrendous mind-invasive technology.
[13:26:14.920 --> 13:26:16.920]  Absolutely horrendous.
[13:26:16.920 --> 13:26:18.920]  There is a tyranny out there.
[13:26:18.920 --> 13:26:20.920]  It is carefully hidden.
[13:26:20.920 --> 13:26:27.920]  It is now coming into plain view, and its engine is specifically driven to control, control, control.
[13:26:27.920 --> 13:26:31.920]  The situation at the moment, I think, I'm going slightly off-piece here,
[13:26:31.920 --> 13:26:34.920]  is that the people in power have not got a clue.
[13:26:34.920 --> 13:26:39.920]  And I'm sure you will agree with me that they have not got a clue what is controlling them.
[13:26:39.920 --> 13:26:44.920]  And you see a lot of illuminati symbolism in the pop music industry,
[13:26:44.920 --> 13:26:47.920]  with the famous all-seeing eye and the horn symbol,
[13:26:47.920 --> 13:26:50.920]  that famous kind of occult, I think it's that occult saying,
[13:26:50.920 --> 13:26:54.920]  we approve of his presence on high as in the coming of the Antichrist.
[13:26:54.920 --> 13:26:59.920]  And I discovered, because of all my UFO interactions and strange experiences,
[13:26:59.920 --> 13:27:01.920]  that I had swallowed a red pill.
[13:27:01.920 --> 13:27:05.920]  And whether I liked it or not, I was truly seeing the world around me
[13:27:05.920 --> 13:27:09.920]  for what it really was, the humanity was being controlled.
[13:27:09.920 --> 13:27:14.920]  And so I was followed in pubs, I had phone calls, I had an unmarked helicopter film me.
[13:27:14.920 --> 13:27:18.920]  We had to take that to James Defence Weekly, should I say, I did.
[13:27:18.920 --> 13:27:21.920]  We took that to James Defence Weekly.
[13:27:21.920 --> 13:27:26.920]  They looked at it and they said that the helicopter that filmed you is an AS-555.
[13:27:26.920 --> 13:27:31.920]  It's a special forces helicopter that is unique to the governments of the US and Canada.
[13:27:31.920 --> 13:27:35.920]  If you look in anything, any of the kit that the RAF have,
[13:27:35.920 --> 13:27:37.920]  the RAF don't have this particular helicopter.
[13:27:37.920 --> 13:27:40.920]  And a links pilot looked at it and said it was equipped with a winch
[13:27:40.920 --> 13:27:45.920]  and was a sliding door variant, which was also pointed out by James Defence Weekly
[13:27:45.920 --> 13:27:49.920]  that it had a sliding door variation, which was very unique on this type of helicopter.
[13:27:49.920 --> 13:27:51.920]  It was green and it was a mart.
[13:27:51.920 --> 13:27:55.920]  And it was at the height of these UFOs coming over my home.
[13:27:55.920 --> 13:28:01.920]  And I couldn't quite piece together at that time in 1999 why they were doing that.
[13:28:01.920 --> 13:28:06.920]  But I ended up being targeted by very mind-invasive technology.
[13:28:06.920 --> 13:28:12.920]  Nasty, nasty stuff, followed into pubs by, we would call them, intelligence operatives.
[13:28:12.920 --> 13:28:19.920]  And you may think that this is an extremely kooky story made up to sell books,
[13:28:19.920 --> 13:28:22.920]  to sell my latest book, etc, etc.
[13:28:22.920 --> 13:28:26.920]  But it isn't. I had a responsible job, Paul, and I had to leave that because of it all.
[13:28:26.920 --> 13:28:32.920]  There was one morning I was actually attacked by this mind-invasive technology in about January 2001
[13:28:32.920 --> 13:28:36.920]  and I actually thought that I was going to die.
[13:28:36.920 --> 13:28:39.920]  On many occasions I've sailed close to the wind with these situations
[13:28:39.920 --> 13:28:43.920]  because there is a firm cover-up in place for the wrong reasons.
[13:28:43.920 --> 13:28:47.920]  And the people in power, what they're doing at the moment, they don't know what they're doing
[13:28:47.920 --> 13:28:49.920]  and this will have consequences.
[13:28:49.920 --> 13:28:54.920]  And this is what the UFOs were apparently, apparently, should I say, pointing out.
[13:28:54.920 --> 13:28:57.920]  On the Internet you have things like the ASTAR command
[13:28:57.920 --> 13:29:01.920]  and other things that talk of the alien beings being love and light.
[13:29:01.920 --> 13:29:03.920]  And that's not necessarily true.
[13:29:03.920 --> 13:29:08.920]  There's serious, ethical issues involved in these UFOs and what is going on,
[13:29:08.920 --> 13:29:12.920]  as well as secretive government agencies in the US and the UK.
[13:29:12.920 --> 13:29:16.920]  The US intelligence discovered to their horror in 1950
[13:29:16.920 --> 13:29:21.920]  what perhaps the UFO phenomenon was all about and it took me years to conquer this.
[13:29:21.920 --> 13:29:24.920]  So that's the kind of like the background, Paul.
[13:29:24.920 --> 13:29:27.920]  Good grief I've waffled on for nearly 11 minutes.
[13:29:27.920 --> 13:29:31.920]  That's kind of like the background to what was going on.
[13:29:31.920 --> 13:29:34.920]  I'm suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from all this
[13:29:34.920 --> 13:29:37.920]  as is quite a few people who have been subjected to it.
[13:29:37.920 --> 13:29:39.920]  But it's the harassment, Paul.
[13:29:39.920 --> 13:29:42.920]  It's nasty, nasty, nasty.
[13:29:42.920 --> 13:29:44.920]  And there are very nasty people behind it.
[13:29:44.920 --> 13:29:48.920]  And I was told that they wanted this kept quiet.
[13:29:48.920 --> 13:29:53.920]  Tony, I mean, what do you say in response to people who question,
[13:29:53.920 --> 13:29:57.920]  why would they harass you? Why follow you? Why are you in particular?
[13:29:57.920 --> 13:29:59.920]  Well, they don't just harass me, though, Paul.
[13:29:59.920 --> 13:30:01.920]  It's not me in particular that they harass.
[13:30:01.920 --> 13:30:07.920]  If you look at the bigger picture, you soon discover that other researchers were being harassed.
[13:30:07.920 --> 13:30:11.920]  There was a guy in New Zealand who keeps himself quiet now called Alec Neald
[13:30:11.920 --> 13:30:13.920]  who wrote a book called Co-Evolution.
[13:30:13.920 --> 13:30:14.920]  He was harassed.
[13:30:14.920 --> 13:30:17.920]  He had people from the Royal Institute of International Affairs,
[13:30:17.920 --> 13:30:19.920]  which I'm sure you're familiar with, Paul,
[13:30:19.920 --> 13:30:23.920]  and the Australian Defence Research people turn up on his doorstep,
[13:30:23.920 --> 13:30:26.920]  asking why his car, wanting to confiscate his car,
[13:30:26.920 --> 13:30:30.920]  because his car had been subjected to high electrical voltage.
[13:30:30.920 --> 13:30:37.920]  The story of Alec Neald as he was driving down the road in 1996, something like that.
[13:30:37.920 --> 13:30:39.920]  And he went missing for 10 days.
[13:30:39.920 --> 13:30:41.920]  And he didn't know where he was.
[13:30:41.920 --> 13:30:44.920]  As far as he was concerned, he thought he was in a car accident.
[13:30:44.920 --> 13:30:47.920]  He had two ghostly figures walking towards him.
[13:30:47.920 --> 13:30:50.920]  And he thought there were ghosts because he thought he was dead, but they weren't ghosts.
[13:30:50.920 --> 13:30:51.920]  They were aliens.
[13:30:51.920 --> 13:30:55.920]  They had been dimensionally transferred into another environment.
[13:30:55.920 --> 13:31:00.920]  And so he got harassment and he got stitched up with a prison sentence.
[13:31:00.920 --> 13:31:06.920]  Another woman called Dr Carla Turner, who I highly recommend in the United States,
[13:31:06.920 --> 13:31:09.920]  she was right on the money, I think, with what was happening.
[13:31:09.920 --> 13:31:11.920]  She's certainly been harassed.
[13:31:11.920 --> 13:31:14.920]  Dr Stephen Greer has certainly been harassed.
[13:31:14.920 --> 13:31:19.920]  But it's when it gets mind invasive, Paul, when they start the mind invasive stuff
[13:31:19.920 --> 13:31:24.920]  as reported by a lot of people, that's when it really does get particularly nasty.
[13:31:24.920 --> 13:31:29.920]  And you have all on trying to keep sane with it all and all on trying to cope with it.
[13:31:29.920 --> 13:31:32.920]  There's a very real conspiracy, a very real one indeed,
[13:31:32.920 --> 13:31:38.920]  to which the material of Info Wars and the conspiracy of UFOs do merge.
[13:31:38.920 --> 13:31:43.920]  Let's bring it back to that convergence which you mentioned at the start of the show.
[13:31:43.920 --> 13:31:48.920]  Back in August, the New York Times writer and economist Paul Krugman
[13:31:48.920 --> 13:31:50.920]  said the following on CNN.
[13:31:50.920 --> 13:31:54.920]  This is a quote, quote, if we discovered that space aliens were planning to attack
[13:31:54.920 --> 13:31:58.920]  and we needed a massive buildup to counter the space alien threat
[13:31:58.920 --> 13:32:04.920]  and a real rally and budget deficits took secondary place to that.
[13:32:04.920 --> 13:32:08.920]  This slump, he's talking about the economic slump, would be over in 18 months.
[13:32:08.920 --> 13:32:11.920]  And then if we discovered, oops, we made a mistake.
[13:32:11.920 --> 13:32:14.920]  There aren't any aliens, we'd be better.
[13:32:14.920 --> 13:32:17.920]  Now, we've heard the famous Reagan quote in a similar context
[13:32:17.920 --> 13:32:21.920]  where he's speaking during the Cold War about this alien threat.
[13:32:21.920 --> 13:32:25.920]  If we had this alien threat, it would band us all together.
[13:32:25.920 --> 13:32:29.920]  To your mind, Tony, is this notion that they'd fake an alien threat
[13:32:29.920 --> 13:32:33.920]  to get this world government to achieve their political agenda too far-fetched,
[13:32:33.920 --> 13:32:38.920]  or is it something we can actually expect to see at some point down the line?
[13:32:38.920 --> 13:32:43.920]  Well, I'm going to shock your listeners, Paul, because I've had nearly a world,
[13:32:43.920 --> 13:32:47.920]  I've got a big world view on this and I've had nearly a lifetime of experience
[13:32:47.920 --> 13:32:49.920]  in dealing with all this.
[13:32:49.920 --> 13:32:51.920]  The man doesn't know simply what he's talking about
[13:32:51.920 --> 13:32:55.920]  and it's just a pity that there isn't some guys from the military
[13:32:55.920 --> 13:33:00.920]  who deal with UFOs and kind of like are on a similar theme to me.
[13:33:00.920 --> 13:33:05.920]  How can I describe how this scenario could come about from my own experiences?
[13:33:05.920 --> 13:33:09.920]  No, they will not be a staged alien invasion.
[13:33:09.920 --> 13:33:11.920]  There isn't going to be one.
[13:33:11.920 --> 13:33:14.920]  The back-engineered technology projects that are going on
[13:33:14.920 --> 13:33:19.920]  and there's a possible liaison between the United States governments and them.
[13:33:19.920 --> 13:33:23.920]  They know the drill. These aliens, they were aliens, you call them aliens,
[13:33:23.920 --> 13:33:27.920]  but in fact they're people like us, Paul, a bit more intelligent,
[13:33:27.920 --> 13:33:31.920]  a bit taller, a bit different looking, but they're savvy people.
[13:33:31.920 --> 13:33:33.920]  They know the drill.
[13:33:33.920 --> 13:33:37.920]  This is the thing that I've picked up from my experiences and it is this.
[13:33:37.920 --> 13:33:42.920]  At the moment, if you look at situations in Libya where they went into Libya,
[13:33:42.920 --> 13:33:48.920]  and I'm sure you will agree, this was, if you could call it, a Rothschild land grab of the highest degree,
[13:33:48.920 --> 13:33:53.920]  where they bombed the water supply, bombed the innocent women and children.
[13:33:53.920 --> 13:33:59.920]  In the UK media, this was paraded as freedom, as freeing the people of Libya.
[13:33:59.920 --> 13:34:05.920]  And as we well know, this created a condition, Paul, of carnage.
[13:34:05.920 --> 13:34:10.920]  Now the place is unlawful, Iraq, carnage, Afghanistan, carnage,
[13:34:10.920 --> 13:34:17.920]  but yet at the very top, lucrative business contracts, lucrative profits, and so on and so forth.
[13:34:17.920 --> 13:34:23.920]  These men who control this power, people like Tony Blair, who courted Gaddafi,
[13:34:23.920 --> 13:34:26.920]  I'm coming to my point in a minute, he courted Colonel Gaddafi very closely.
[13:34:26.920 --> 13:34:29.920]  He was going to stitch him up and he probably knew this.
[13:34:29.920 --> 13:34:34.920]  And all those type of men who are in power and follow this agenda and do the bidding for the agenda
[13:34:34.920 --> 13:34:41.920]  have created an environment, a created like an environment that could manifest conditions
[13:34:41.920 --> 13:34:45.920]  for the second coming of an Antichrist.
[13:34:45.920 --> 13:34:47.920]  And boy, oh boy, they don't know what they're doing.
[13:34:47.920 --> 13:34:50.920]  They don't know what power they're dealing with and karma is a very funny thing.
[13:34:50.920 --> 13:34:55.920]  And so it won't be a fake alien invasion that we will have to deal with.
[13:34:55.920 --> 13:34:59.920]  It would be the manifestation of an Antichrist that we would have to deal with,
[13:34:59.920 --> 13:35:05.920]  coming from a direction that we in the UK or the US government would not see coming
[13:35:05.920 --> 13:35:09.920]  because there is a saying in the intelligence company, the enemy is in front of you,
[13:35:09.920 --> 13:35:11.920]  but the boogers are behind you.
[13:35:11.920 --> 13:35:15.920]  And in this scenario, what's going on in our world currently, the boogers are certainly behind us.
[13:35:15.920 --> 13:35:17.920]  And so that is my opinion.
[13:35:17.920 --> 13:35:19.920]  It won't be a fake alien invasion.
[13:35:19.920 --> 13:35:23.920]  It will be a sudden and very shocking situation that we will have to deal with.
[13:35:23.920 --> 13:35:28.920]  Triggered by various events that seem to just matter that are malevolence,
[13:35:28.920 --> 13:35:33.920]  that are going on at the moment, everything from the Illuminati to the child sacrifice,
[13:35:33.920 --> 13:35:37.920]  to the bank heist that's going on at the moment, create an environment,
[13:35:37.920 --> 13:35:42.920]  a signal in time as it were, Paul, that can escalate and amplify
[13:35:42.920 --> 13:35:46.920]  and turn into something very nasty and then turn upon us.
[13:35:46.920 --> 13:35:53.920]  And that is what I've picked up from the UFO experiences that I have had.
[13:35:53.920 --> 13:35:58.920]  Here's a quote from, I mean, regarding the false Antichrist second coming,
[13:35:58.920 --> 13:36:06.920]  the technology to do mass projections in the sky of that kind of event was available 20, 30 years ago.
[13:36:06.920 --> 13:36:08.920]  No, no, Paul, no, no, Paul, I must caution you on that.
[13:36:08.920 --> 13:36:09.920]  This is very serious.
[13:36:09.920 --> 13:36:13.920]  No, no, you may say that you may dismiss it as it being technology.
[13:36:13.920 --> 13:36:15.920]  This is not about technology.
[13:36:15.920 --> 13:36:22.920]  This is about an element of the mind, an element of biophysical reality that we do not understand.
[13:36:22.920 --> 13:36:25.920]  This is about unknown forces that will manifest.
[13:36:25.920 --> 13:36:29.920]  Paranormal unknown forces, not technology, but paranormal unknown forces,
[13:36:29.920 --> 13:36:33.920]  which is why we're being warned by them, continually warned,
[13:36:33.920 --> 13:36:38.920]  because all is linked to all and this is like a signal line in time that's coming back at us.
[13:36:38.920 --> 13:36:44.920]  This is like a paranormal, how can I put it, the matrix meets inception kind of thing
[13:36:44.920 --> 13:36:51.920]  that I managed to manage to that was tossed into in a situation that I did not understand.
[13:36:51.920 --> 13:36:54.920]  Don't dismiss it, Paul, because it's absolutely lethal.
[13:36:54.920 --> 13:36:58.920]  The situation could develop into something that's lethal.
[13:36:58.920 --> 13:36:59.920]  Well, I'm not dismissing it.
[13:36:59.920 --> 13:37:02.920]  I'm just saying they've got the capability to do it.
[13:37:02.920 --> 13:37:06.920]  But I asked people to give questions on Facebook.
[13:37:06.920 --> 13:37:13.920]  One of the key questions is when people report UFOs and speculate their origin is extraterrestrial,
[13:37:13.920 --> 13:37:19.920]  isn't that very useful for governments that want to keep black budget programs under wraps?
[13:37:19.920 --> 13:37:25.920]  I mean, we had the B2 stealth bomber that was being tested 10 years before it was made public.
[13:37:25.920 --> 13:37:31.920]  How many of these UFO reports are merely people misidentifying the latest stealth fighter,
[13:37:31.920 --> 13:37:35.920]  the latest technology upgrade for the US military or other militaries?
[13:37:35.920 --> 13:37:36.920]  Quite a few.
[13:37:36.920 --> 13:37:44.920]  Do excuse me, Paul, if I come across as maybe being, what's the word, irritated slightly
[13:37:44.920 --> 13:37:50.920]  because I've got a bit of a do going on with all this and it's a very difficult situation to be in.
[13:37:50.920 --> 13:37:55.920]  And sometimes I'm not myself, so you obviously did understand what I was saying about the Antichrist
[13:37:55.920 --> 13:37:57.920]  and you weren't dismissing it.
[13:37:57.920 --> 13:37:59.920]  I can clearly see that.
[13:37:59.920 --> 13:38:04.920]  Yes, so the question was UFOs, black governments, all that kind of thing.
[13:38:04.920 --> 13:38:06.920]  Yes, it is a benefit to them.
[13:38:06.920 --> 13:38:08.920]  It certainly is.
[13:38:08.920 --> 13:38:15.920]  Nick Pope in the UK would argue that these classified claff that fly around, these black budget claff
[13:38:15.920 --> 13:38:22.920]  that are flying about are in fact in designated top secret zones that are not over UK populations.
[13:38:22.920 --> 13:38:29.920]  However, in America, as is clearly seen, some of these triangles that are flying over in fleets of 12 or more
[13:38:29.920 --> 13:38:34.920]  are going across populated areas and there seems to be no real explanation of it.
[13:38:34.920 --> 13:38:36.920]  And yes, it certainly does benefit governments.
[13:38:36.920 --> 13:38:39.920]  I would suggest it certainly does.
[13:38:39.920 --> 13:38:48.920]  But I mean, with the black triangles, the UK Ministry of Defence said that their explanation was people were hallucinating plasma.
[13:38:48.920 --> 13:38:52.920]  I mean, these black triangles are physical craft.
[13:38:52.920 --> 13:38:54.920]  They've been seen in radio.
[13:38:54.920 --> 13:38:58.920]  I've seen them personally several years ago.
[13:38:58.920 --> 13:39:07.920]  But I think from that perspective, it's likely to be the latest, you know, stealth fighter, the latest top secret technology, as you just mentioned.
[13:39:07.920 --> 13:39:17.920]  But I mean, again, on a similar topic with these abduction experiences, wouldn't the cover of alien abduction,
[13:39:17.920 --> 13:39:23.920]  and I know this has been covered in the UFO research community, wouldn't that be a perfect disguise for governments
[13:39:23.920 --> 13:39:33.920]  to carry out mass human experimentation while blaming it on some off-planetary excuse in the entertainment media and mass media in general?
[13:39:33.920 --> 13:39:36.920]  Yes, it would be, Paul.
[13:39:36.920 --> 13:39:39.920]  It would be very valid, but it depends what government you're talking about,
[13:39:39.920 --> 13:39:44.920]  because there's white government and black government, as you rightly know.
[13:39:44.920 --> 13:39:46.920]  So I think it depends what faction is which.
[13:39:46.920 --> 13:39:54.920]  I think that the factions, the agencies, the clandestine-ness and the secrecy involved in the UFO cover-up across the world
[13:39:54.920 --> 13:39:57.920]  means that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing.
[13:39:57.920 --> 13:40:05.920]  Therefore, you could not get a contingent, a coherent operation together to deceive en masse,
[13:40:05.920 --> 13:40:09.920]  because it's probably not quite as easy as that as it looks.
[13:40:09.920 --> 13:40:13.920]  Not only that, people are having visitations of a peaceful nature.
[13:40:13.920 --> 13:40:20.920]  What is of more concern, as you have rightly said, is the media cranking the fear element up of the UFO situation.
[13:40:20.920 --> 13:40:26.920]  I run the gauntlet because I've had on a number of occasions, and I was attacked twice now by UFOs on two occasions,
[13:40:26.920 --> 13:40:29.920]  and I had to do a hell of a lot of research to piece together what it could be.
[13:40:29.920 --> 13:40:32.920]  The MOD would say that was plasma.
[13:40:32.920 --> 13:40:35.920]  I would say it wasn't. I certainly knew what happened to me.
[13:40:35.920 --> 13:40:39.920]  And with somebody like me, this is the kind of theme they would go down.
[13:40:39.920 --> 13:40:49.920]  They could put somebody like me in the media spotlight, put it kind of like deflect away from peaceful UFO contact,
[13:40:49.920 --> 13:40:52.920]  and kind of like focus on the fear element.
[13:40:52.920 --> 13:40:56.920]  Because as you well know, this world is all about fears, fear, isn't it?
[13:40:56.920 --> 13:41:02.920]  Info wars is all about confronting that fear, exposing the information, all that kind of thing.
[13:41:02.920 --> 13:41:11.920]  And so it's beneficial to crank it up in the media that these aliens are something to be feared and something to be attacked.
[13:41:11.920 --> 13:41:14.920]  It's very beneficial to do so.
[13:41:14.920 --> 13:41:22.920]  On the subject of animal mutilations, I mean, these are occurring across the world with surgical precision.
[13:41:22.920 --> 13:41:28.920]  They find certain organs, certain body parts removed from cattle and other animals.
[13:41:28.920 --> 13:41:34.920]  Do you think they've also lumped that in with the whole UFO alien thing as a means of downplaying it
[13:41:34.920 --> 13:41:40.920]  and making the public think it's non-existent when in fact is a very real phenomenon?
[13:41:40.920 --> 13:41:45.920]  Yeah, I think they are downplaying it, but I think it is a very real phenomenon.
[13:41:45.920 --> 13:41:49.920]  And the thing is that there's a very big cover-up going on with that at the moment.
[13:41:49.920 --> 13:41:54.920]  I know of a man, and I recommend his book on Amazon, a guy called Mike Freeberry,
[13:41:54.920 --> 13:42:02.920]  who did a book about cattle mutilations and he went to hell and back with Devon Police here in the UK.
[13:42:02.920 --> 13:42:09.920]  I think it was Devon Police who were refusing photographs to him regarding cattle mutilations.
[13:42:09.920 --> 13:42:13.920]  The point being, he was trying to assist them because he'd been doing independent research
[13:42:13.920 --> 13:42:19.920]  and he had tried to piece together what was going on and he was offered to assist them, but Devon Police refused.
[13:42:19.920 --> 13:42:26.920]  And so there was a big Freedom of Information Act bust up over this and he eventually got hold of the photos.
[13:42:26.920 --> 13:42:30.920]  And they reckoned that it was not human what was doing this.
[13:42:30.920 --> 13:42:32.920]  I mean, the conclusion was that it was not human.
[13:42:32.920 --> 13:42:36.920]  Oddly enough, Paul, I was at a UFO conference and I was talking about all this.
[13:42:36.920 --> 13:42:42.920]  And a woman came up to me, as they so often do, who said that she worked for the civil service.
[13:42:42.920 --> 13:42:48.920]  She'd retired, but she was to do with issues of national security and the Ministry of Defence charming woman.
[13:42:48.920 --> 13:42:54.920]  She said that she'd rather not talk about too much going to detail,
[13:42:54.920 --> 13:42:59.920]  but she was saying that cattle mutilations were a particularly nasty thing that they had to deal with
[13:42:59.920 --> 13:43:01.920]  and it was causing great concern.
[13:43:01.920 --> 13:43:06.920]  But she didn't want to say any more because she'd retired and she didn't want the public hassle of standing up and speaking.
[13:43:06.920 --> 13:43:12.920]  Because she knew what it was like, she said, to be on the radar and arrest, which is what happens, Paul.
[13:43:12.920 --> 13:43:14.920]  It certainly is.
[13:43:14.920 --> 13:43:18.920]  Sorry, go on.
[13:43:18.920 --> 13:43:23.920]  Why, from your experience, why are they performing these mutilations? What's the purpose?
[13:43:23.920 --> 13:43:27.920]  Well, some would say that it is genetic.
[13:43:27.920 --> 13:43:32.920]  Researcher Linda Howe would say that it is genetic,
[13:43:32.920 --> 13:43:38.920]  that it is something that is actually involved in genetic breeding
[13:43:38.920 --> 13:43:41.920]  and genetic experimentation and it needs large amounts of blood.
[13:43:41.920 --> 13:43:45.920]  I would say my semi-professional opinion on the cattle mutilation
[13:43:45.920 --> 13:43:52.920]  is that we are dealing with a specific non-human entity that is coming in and that is actually mutilating them.
[13:43:52.920 --> 13:43:59.920]  And I would concur with the researcher, Mike Freeberry, that there's a degree of psychopathy involved in this,
[13:43:59.920 --> 13:44:06.920]  that whatever they are, or whatever is causing it, whatever entity it is, is extremely nasty and extremely malevolent in its cause.
[13:44:06.920 --> 13:44:12.920]  But I also subscribe to the point of view that this, Paul, could be the military experimenting with precision lasers,
[13:44:12.920 --> 13:44:16.920]  which is a possibility that cannot be ruled out.
[13:44:16.920 --> 13:44:19.920]  That would suggest, yeah, definitely so.
[13:44:19.920 --> 13:44:26.920]  Now, I want to look at it from a media perspective now, because a lot of UFO researchers are kind of maligned as kooks,
[13:44:26.920 --> 13:44:28.920]  as you mentioned earlier in the show.
[13:44:28.920 --> 13:44:34.920]  But then we have the History Channel, which routinely makes one-hour documentaries about UFOs.
[13:44:34.920 --> 13:44:38.920]  So it seems like the establishment media is trying to have its cake and eat it.
[13:44:38.920 --> 13:44:43.920]  On the one hand, they malign people who are into this subject as crazy and paranoid.
[13:44:43.920 --> 13:44:49.920]  On the other hand, they're producing slick professional one-hour documentaries on places like the History Channel.
[13:44:49.920 --> 13:44:55.920]  Meanwhile, on the second channel, treating 9-Eleven Truthers like Holocaust deniers.
[13:44:55.920 --> 13:44:57.920]  So why are they trying to have it both ways?
[13:44:57.920 --> 13:45:01.920]  Why are they trying to promote UFOs as a real genuine subject?
[13:45:01.920 --> 13:45:04.920]  Well, on the other hand, dismissing it as kookdom.
[13:45:04.920 --> 13:45:06.920]  Yes, indeed. They're not trying to.
[13:45:06.920 --> 13:45:15.920]  I think what they're doing, and it's very subtle, but I think the subject of UFOs and UFOology is an interesting one,
[13:45:15.920 --> 13:45:18.920]  because what they're doing, what you see in these documentaries, Paul,
[13:45:18.920 --> 13:45:25.920]  is just the documentaries are very focused on strange lights in the sky and what went on with those strange lights.
[13:45:25.920 --> 13:45:32.920]  That's what I feel, there's this continual run-around about people following the strange lights in the sky
[13:45:32.920 --> 13:45:35.920]  and what they thought of the strange lights, and it could be and it couldn't be.
[13:45:35.920 --> 13:45:38.920]  And it doesn't seem to click onto any other level.
[13:45:38.920 --> 13:45:40.920]  It's in a very safe zone.
[13:45:40.920 --> 13:45:43.920]  As a result of that, people watch these programs.
[13:45:43.920 --> 13:45:46.920]  People, in fact, even go to the conferences.
[13:45:46.920 --> 13:45:50.920]  And you'll hear somebody like, now then, let me spring to mind, who's the guy?
[13:45:50.920 --> 13:45:53.920]  The rancher. Have you, Paul? Who's the rancher with the UFO experience?
[13:45:53.920 --> 13:45:55.920]  It's James Gilliland, is it?
[13:45:55.920 --> 13:46:01.920]  I saw him stand up at a conference, and he was talking about the fact that he'd met some occupants in the UFOs
[13:46:01.920 --> 13:46:04.920]  and they came over to him and gave him a big hug and this, that, and the other.
[13:46:04.920 --> 13:46:07.920]  Well, the researchers will stand up and talk about their experiences,
[13:46:07.920 --> 13:46:12.920]  but it's just not enough for people who are traumatised by these experiences
[13:46:12.920 --> 13:46:14.920]  and are trying to search for answers.
[13:46:14.920 --> 13:46:17.920]  They're not getting answers, and they're certainly not getting answers
[13:46:17.920 --> 13:46:20.920]  from the people who are writing the books and doing the documentaries.
[13:46:20.920 --> 13:46:23.920]  And people are banging their heads against wall.
[13:46:23.920 --> 13:46:26.920]  People have come up to me traumatised and told me some stuff.
[13:46:26.920 --> 13:46:31.920]  I mean, for the US listeners, the number of US Marines and former Vietnam veterans
[13:46:31.920 --> 13:46:35.920]  who have emailed me regarding UFO incidents in Vietnam,
[13:46:35.920 --> 13:46:39.920]  one guy emailed me to say that he actually guarded one.
[13:46:39.920 --> 13:46:42.920]  You know, it is absolutely unbelievable.
[13:46:42.920 --> 13:46:45.920]  And they're approaching with, you know, they're wary.
[13:46:45.920 --> 13:46:49.920]  They are trying to find answers and feel that they're not getting these answers.
[13:46:49.920 --> 13:46:52.920]  You have authors like Whitley Stryber.
[13:46:52.920 --> 13:46:54.920]  There's a book by Colonel John Alexander.
[13:46:54.920 --> 13:46:56.920]  The book talks about UFOs, but it doesn't.
[13:46:56.920 --> 13:47:00.920]  It talks about the meetings he had involving UFOs with the people.
[13:47:00.920 --> 13:47:02.920]  It just does not provide answers.
[13:47:02.920 --> 13:47:06.920]  That's what I feel, Paul, about the issue.
[13:47:06.920 --> 13:47:11.920]  Now, one of the really hardcore cases in this subject
[13:47:11.920 --> 13:47:14.920]  is the Rendlesham Forest Bentwas case,
[13:47:14.920 --> 13:47:18.920]  because this happened on a US military base in England
[13:47:18.920 --> 13:47:22.920]  where, if I'm correct, nuclear technology or nuclear weapons
[13:47:22.920 --> 13:47:24.920]  were actually stored at the time.
[13:47:24.920 --> 13:47:26.920]  This was back, I believe, in the late 70s.
[13:47:26.920 --> 13:47:29.920]  Can you explain that case and its significance?
[13:47:29.920 --> 13:47:34.920]  Well, I mean, Rendlesham Forest was classed as Britain's Roswell.
[13:47:34.920 --> 13:47:40.920]  Actually, Rendlesham had another incident in 1956 or 1950 there about.
[13:47:40.920 --> 13:47:42.920]  Well, it wasn't Rendlesham Forest.
[13:47:42.920 --> 13:47:48.920]  It was the US air base near that that actually had the UFO incident
[13:47:48.920 --> 13:47:51.920]  that occurred in the 1950s, Woodbridge.
[13:47:51.920 --> 13:47:54.920]  REF Woodbridge had a UFO event in 1950.
[13:47:54.920 --> 13:47:57.920]  So it seems to be the repeated theme.
[13:47:57.920 --> 13:47:59.920]  Sorry, Paul, say again.
[13:47:59.920 --> 13:48:00.920]  No, go ahead.
[13:48:00.920 --> 13:48:01.920]  Oh, yes.
[13:48:01.920 --> 13:48:05.920]  No, it seems to be the repeated theme of UFOs turning up on the premises.
[13:48:05.920 --> 13:48:11.920]  Now, the men of that Air Force Security Police Regiment
[13:48:11.920 --> 13:48:15.920]  on the Facebook page called Justice for the 82nd.
[13:48:15.920 --> 13:48:19.920]  What amazes me always about these incidents that happened in Rendlesham
[13:48:19.920 --> 13:48:24.920]  where we've got the tape of the Colonel, we've got all sorts happening
[13:48:24.920 --> 13:48:28.920]  is that these men are clearly traumatised by what they saw
[13:48:28.920 --> 13:48:30.920]  and they're clearly being lied to
[13:48:30.920 --> 13:48:34.920]  and there's incidents of them being taken aside by intelligence people
[13:48:34.920 --> 13:48:37.920]  and then told to shut up and all that kind of thing.
[13:48:37.920 --> 13:48:39.920]  They're being continually lied to
[13:48:39.920 --> 13:48:44.920]  and the operation and trauma is certainly present on the Facebook page that they have
[13:48:44.920 --> 13:48:46.920]  which is called Justice for the 82nd.
[13:48:46.920 --> 13:48:51.920]  And so I always find that there is a human factor that is very much missed,
[13:48:51.920 --> 13:48:56.920]  the effect that the UFO interaction has on people
[13:48:56.920 --> 13:48:59.920]  because we have been hidden in a veil, Paul,
[13:48:59.920 --> 13:49:02.920]  we're hidden in a veil where the wool has been pulled over our eyes
[13:49:02.920 --> 13:49:06.920]  and we are not conditioned to accept other realities that are around us.
[13:49:06.920 --> 13:49:09.920]  There's this terrible malevolent veil around the world at the moment
[13:49:09.920 --> 13:49:12.920]  and so these men saw a glimpse outside of that.
[13:49:12.920 --> 13:49:16.920]  Some say, you know, the British MOD said that it was offered light house a thing.
[13:49:16.920 --> 13:49:19.920]  There was a few other excuses going on about what it was and what it wasn't.
[13:49:19.920 --> 13:49:23.920]  But those men on that evening know what they saw at Rendlesham.
[13:49:23.920 --> 13:49:27.920]  The rumor was that it was some sort of engine problem that the UFO had
[13:49:27.920 --> 13:49:30.920]  and it had landed on the ground and et cetera, et cetera.
[13:49:30.920 --> 13:49:35.920]  Oddly enough, the other human factor occurs with the Burwin Mountains incident
[13:49:35.920 --> 13:49:40.920]  where I was at a conference giving a talk about the Burwin Mountains UFO incident in Wales
[13:49:40.920 --> 13:49:44.920]  and we had to shut the cameras off because a lady stepped forward.
[13:49:44.920 --> 13:49:49.920]  She didn't want to go public with this because she did not trust UFO researchers.
[13:49:49.920 --> 13:49:53.920]  UFO researchers were going into the village of Corwin or whereabouts it happened
[13:49:53.920 --> 13:49:57.920]  and there were pestering people running off with exclusive rights to the media
[13:49:57.920 --> 13:50:00.920]  and all that kind of thing and this lady had clearly had enough of all that.
[13:50:00.920 --> 13:50:04.920]  So we turned the cameras off and she came out with this extraordinary story
[13:50:04.920 --> 13:50:09.920]  that is not published about the Burwin Mountains UFO incident in Wales
[13:50:09.920 --> 13:50:14.920]  about the fact that a number of children were suffering laser burns
[13:50:14.920 --> 13:50:17.920]  from the UFO incident that happened there and had to be taken to hospital
[13:50:17.920 --> 13:50:24.920]  and she and three other people were once again traumatised, looking for questions
[13:50:24.920 --> 13:50:28.920]  and were not getting answers and this comes across continually with incidents
[13:50:28.920 --> 13:50:31.920]  at Rendlesham with incidents at the Burwin Mountains
[13:50:31.920 --> 13:50:35.920]  for the U.S. audience, the former Marines and military people that emailed me
[13:50:35.920 --> 13:50:39.920]  from the U.S. trying to find answers and sometimes they'll go,
[13:50:39.920 --> 13:50:42.920]  Tony, can you explain this and the answer is no, I can't.
[13:50:42.920 --> 13:50:45.920]  I had an incident this morning, Paul, before I got up
[13:50:45.920 --> 13:50:49.920]  whereby once again I was attacked by mind-invasive technology.
[13:50:49.920 --> 13:50:54.920]  I can't explain why, I know that it's invasive, I know that it was telling me to shut up,
[13:50:54.920 --> 13:50:57.920]  I know that it's bullying, I know that they want this kept quiet
[13:50:57.920 --> 13:51:02.920]  because there's a shift, a paradigm shift across our world at the moment
[13:51:02.920 --> 13:51:06.920]  where the reality is changing and they don't want that to happen.
[13:51:06.920 --> 13:51:13.920]  So there's some very big human factors involved in UFO incidents including Rendlesham.
[13:51:13.920 --> 13:51:16.920]  Those poor men, they're still searching for answers
[13:51:16.920 --> 13:51:21.920]  and they're still frustrated with their officers who they believe were bought
[13:51:21.920 --> 13:51:24.920]  or told to keep quiet and they believe that their superior officers
[13:51:24.920 --> 13:51:28.920]  were bought to them regarding the Rendlesham incident.
[13:51:28.920 --> 13:51:34.920]  Now we had David Icon yesterday, Tony, and again he was getting into the theory
[13:51:34.920 --> 13:51:39.920]  that this evil, as you said, is so malevolent, so over the top,
[13:51:39.920 --> 13:51:43.920]  that he believes there's a non-human presence behind it
[13:51:43.920 --> 13:51:47.920]  once he goes to the end of the line and he's talking about, you know,
[13:51:47.920 --> 13:51:52.920]  shapeshift and all this kind of stuff, which I personally don't believe.
[13:51:52.920 --> 13:51:56.920]  I don't believe that evil is at the core of this New World Order agenda.
[13:51:56.920 --> 13:52:00.920]  I haven't seen any solid evidence to say that it's, you know, off-planet aliens
[13:52:00.920 --> 13:52:05.920]  or interdimensional shapeshifters are responsible for it, apart from hearsay.
[13:52:05.920 --> 13:52:09.920]  I mean, I've read David's books and he presents personal accounts of people
[13:52:09.920 --> 13:52:12.920]  that have apparently seen these individuals.
[13:52:12.920 --> 13:52:17.920]  I don't classify that as evidence, I classify it as hearsay.
[13:52:17.920 --> 13:52:20.920]  But I mean, it's still open to debate.
[13:52:20.920 --> 13:52:24.920]  What do you think about this premise that these shapeshifters are controlling
[13:52:24.920 --> 13:52:26.920]  events from behind the scenes?
[13:52:26.920 --> 13:52:28.920]  Well, it's hard to nail it down.
[13:52:28.920 --> 13:52:31.920]  We have got something that is controlling events behind the scenes
[13:52:31.920 --> 13:52:36.920]  and a number of UFO researchers have concluded, and even Alex Jones on this show
[13:52:36.920 --> 13:52:41.920]  I think has concluded this, that there is a non-human intelligence
[13:52:41.920 --> 13:52:44.920]  behind the scenes that is driving all this.
[13:52:44.920 --> 13:52:51.920]  It's surprisingly enough, the remote viewer, for the US listeners now,
[13:52:51.920 --> 13:52:56.920]  the US military's remote viewer, remote viewer 001 Joseph Macmonagle
[13:52:56.920 --> 13:53:00.920]  who entered into the psychic spying program of the United States
[13:53:00.920 --> 13:53:05.920]  had an incident with what he believed to be a reptilian in his living room
[13:53:05.920 --> 13:53:09.920]  and he was awarded medals and so on and so forth.
[13:53:09.920 --> 13:53:14.920]  Now, these remote viewing programs were started in 1970, Paul,
[13:53:14.920 --> 13:53:20.920]  because the Soviets were making very big progress in psychic warfare.
[13:53:20.920 --> 13:53:26.920]  But if we rewind back to 1950 and 1949,
[13:53:26.920 --> 13:53:31.920]  the American intelligence and military were scratching its head
[13:53:31.920 --> 13:53:37.920]  wondering why their planes were being shot out of the sky by UFOs and it's documented
[13:53:37.920 --> 13:53:40.920]  and they weren't just being shot out of the sky at tiny levels,
[13:53:40.920 --> 13:53:44.920]  there was things being blasted out of the sky left, right and centre by these UFOs
[13:53:44.920 --> 13:53:48.920]  and at the time they were sending up F-94 Starfire fighters
[13:53:48.920 --> 13:53:53.920]  who were launching salvos of 12 missiles at a time and bringing them down.
[13:53:53.920 --> 13:53:57.920]  Now back to what you're talking about, they therefore wondered
[13:53:57.920 --> 13:54:02.920]  what the cause was of these UFOs suddenly appearing en masse in their airspace.
[13:54:02.920 --> 13:54:05.920]  Could it be high powered radar, they weren't sure.
[13:54:05.920 --> 13:54:09.920]  And so before the remote viewing programs of 1970 and psychic spotting,
[13:54:09.920 --> 13:54:13.920]  Wright-Paterson Air Force Base, the FBI and the US Army
[13:54:13.920 --> 13:54:16.920]  formed something called the Collins Elite,
[13:54:16.920 --> 13:54:22.920]  which is like a psychic equivalent of Majestic 12 really,
[13:54:22.920 --> 13:54:25.920]  to find out what was going on.
[13:54:25.920 --> 13:54:31.920]  Their conclusion, and it's something I've concluded before I read this information,
[13:54:31.920 --> 13:54:36.920]  their conclusion was that the occult ritual,
[13:54:36.920 --> 13:54:42.920]  ritual occult goings on had caused dimensional portals to open
[13:54:42.920 --> 13:54:46.920]  and we were being invaded by something unknown
[13:54:46.920 --> 13:54:51.920]  and they termed that unknown as non-human entity or NHE, not alien.
[13:54:51.920 --> 13:54:54.920]  There's a difference between peaceful alien interaction
[13:54:54.920 --> 13:54:57.920]  and something that is malevolent and non-human entity.
[13:54:57.920 --> 13:55:02.920]  And I would call it demonic, Paul, I'd call it demonic, they called it demonic as well.
[13:55:02.920 --> 13:55:07.920]  And they concluded to their horror, which I don't concur to,
[13:55:07.920 --> 13:55:09.920]  but the Collins Elite concluded to their horror
[13:55:09.920 --> 13:55:12.920]  that there was a possibility that human souls were being abducted.
[13:55:12.920 --> 13:55:18.920]  But they definitely had collared and observed something that was extremely malevolent.
[13:55:18.920 --> 13:55:21.920]  And the thing is you get these, like Bohemian Grove,
[13:55:21.920 --> 13:55:25.920]  what Alex has covered, what you've covered on your website to do with illuminati,
[13:55:25.920 --> 13:55:27.920]  Bohemian Grove, all that kind of thing,
[13:55:27.920 --> 13:55:32.920]  the extreme malevolence of manifestation that these actions are causing
[13:55:32.920 --> 13:55:36.920]  is putting humanity in a very dangerous place and a very dangerous position.
[13:55:36.920 --> 13:55:43.920]  So I cannot tell whether non-human entities or reptilians, I'm not too sure,
[13:55:43.920 --> 13:55:47.920]  but what we can conclude is that there's something very malevolent and very evil
[13:55:47.920 --> 13:55:49.920]  and very non-human behind all this.
[13:55:49.920 --> 13:55:53.920]  The chaos that we see today in the banking system isn't caused by error,
[13:55:53.920 --> 13:55:57.920]  it's not done by by error, Libya and all these other conflicts that we see.
[13:55:57.920 --> 13:55:59.920]  It's not caused by the folly of politicians,
[13:55:59.920 --> 13:56:03.920]  it's caused by a driven engine and a driven agenda.
[13:56:03.920 --> 13:56:05.920]  Would you not agree?
[13:56:05.920 --> 13:56:07.920]  Well, certainly.
[13:56:07.920 --> 13:56:13.920]  People can't acknowledge the level of evil because they think to themselves,
[13:56:13.920 --> 13:56:18.920]  well, I would never do that and nobody I know would ever go to that level of monstrosity,
[13:56:18.920 --> 13:56:20.920]  so that's why people...
[13:56:20.920 --> 13:56:24.920]  But that's not to believe it.
[13:56:24.920 --> 13:56:27.920]  Yeah, and the thing is, as David Eich has rightly said,
[13:56:27.920 --> 13:56:30.920]  as he once said, you'd read the headlines and think,
[13:56:30.920 --> 13:56:35.920]  they wouldn't do that, they couldn't do that, they bloody do, they really do,
[13:56:35.920 --> 13:56:38.920]  and I've seen it kind of like with what's happened to me,
[13:56:38.920 --> 13:56:41.920]  what they're capable of and what they can do and what they are doing.
[13:56:41.920 --> 13:56:46.920]  As Brian Garrish has rightly said, there is an issue to do with, you know,
[13:56:46.920 --> 13:56:51.920]  children, sacrifice, all that kind of thing, there is an issue about that.
[13:56:51.920 --> 13:56:56.920]  And it's certainly true here in the UK that the metropolitan police
[13:56:56.920 --> 13:56:59.920]  certainly know where the skeletons are buried on issues like that,
[13:56:59.920 --> 13:57:03.920]  but I digress, Paul, we'll stick to UFOs, but you know where I'm coming from.
[13:57:03.920 --> 13:57:09.920]  My producer's interested in this high Brazil mythical island,
[13:57:09.920 --> 13:57:14.920]  supposedly off the coast of the country of Ireland and its connection to UFOs.
[13:57:14.920 --> 13:57:16.920]  Have you heard about this one, high Brazil?
[13:57:16.920 --> 13:57:21.920]  No, I haven't, Paul, no, no, tell more, no, it's something I've not heard about.
[13:57:21.920 --> 13:57:24.920]  Ireland does have a very high rate of UFOs,
[13:57:24.920 --> 13:57:30.920]  and the Irish government is known for being very secretive about the UFO situation,
[13:57:30.920 --> 13:57:33.920]  because of course Ireland has a great mystery about it, doesn't it?
[13:57:33.920 --> 13:57:35.920]  So I'm sure you'll listen to it, do you know about it?
[13:57:35.920 --> 13:57:38.920]  Because I certainly don't on that one, high Brazil is something I've not heard of.
[13:57:38.920 --> 13:57:41.920]  It's a new one on me, but the producer's very interested,
[13:57:41.920 --> 13:57:43.920]  so maybe you could research that.
[13:57:43.920 --> 13:57:44.920]  I will.
[13:57:44.920 --> 13:57:49.920]  You underground bases, USOs, I believe they're called,
[13:57:49.920 --> 13:57:52.920]  unidentified submergeable objects.
[13:57:52.920 --> 13:57:54.920]  What's going on underneath the ground, Tony?
[13:57:54.920 --> 13:57:59.920]  Well, I certainly believe that the UFO I filmed in 1999,
[13:57:59.920 --> 13:58:03.920]  which illuminates a TV antenna, which you can see on my website,
[13:58:03.920 --> 13:58:07.920]  TonyOppsUFO.com, TonyOppsUFO on YouTube.
[13:58:07.920 --> 13:58:10.920]  Have a look at that, you'll see it illuminates a TV antenna,
[13:58:10.920 --> 13:58:15.920]  and I strongly believe that that UFO that I filmed
[13:58:15.920 --> 13:58:19.920]  was not from another planet as such,
[13:58:19.920 --> 13:58:21.920]  it not come all the way from another planet.
[13:58:21.920 --> 13:58:25.920]  It had come from an undersea base from somewhere.
[13:58:25.920 --> 13:58:28.920]  We know in the year in the UK off the coast of Wales
[13:58:28.920 --> 13:58:31.920]  and off the coast there of Liverpool and Southport,
[13:58:31.920 --> 13:58:34.920]  there have been major incidents of flying triangles,
[13:58:34.920 --> 13:58:37.920]  flying out at rates of knots over the sea,
[13:58:37.920 --> 13:58:42.920]  and the situation occurring where jets and so on have chased after them.
[13:58:42.920 --> 13:58:45.920]  I know of a lad I used to work with who worked in the Navy
[13:58:45.920 --> 13:58:47.920]  in submarines in Sonar,
[13:58:47.920 --> 13:58:50.920]  and he was telling me when he was on duty on Sonar,
[13:58:50.920 --> 13:58:53.920]  he was tracking stuff on his Sonar system
[13:58:53.920 --> 13:58:58.920]  at speeds that Russia and America did not have.
[13:58:58.920 --> 13:58:59.920]  These things were travelling at speeds,
[13:58:59.920 --> 13:59:01.920]  Russia and America did not have,
[13:59:01.920 --> 13:59:04.920]  and he had to just class it, his officer said,
[13:59:04.920 --> 13:59:08.920]  you must class that as dolphins, whales,
[13:59:08.920 --> 13:59:11.920]  anything other than mysterious phenomena.
[13:59:11.920 --> 13:59:16.920]  And so there's been various goings on with underwater bases
[13:59:16.920 --> 13:59:20.920]  out there in the oceans, including incidents,
[13:59:20.920 --> 13:59:23.920]  the major incidents which you might be familiar with,
[13:59:23.920 --> 13:59:24.920]  I don't know whether you're listening,
[13:59:24.920 --> 13:59:26.920]  are the incident in the Atlantic near Norway
[13:59:26.920 --> 13:59:30.920]  where it is rumoured that a United States naval ship
[13:59:30.920 --> 13:59:33.920]  actually vanished when a triangle craft came over it,
[13:59:33.920 --> 13:59:35.920]  that it actually vanished.
[13:59:35.920 --> 13:59:37.920]  Actually that ship did sink,
[13:59:37.920 --> 13:59:39.920]  and no explanation has been given to the families
[13:59:39.920 --> 13:59:41.920]  as to what really happened,
[13:59:41.920 --> 13:59:43.920]  but there was a task force sent by NATO
[13:59:43.920 --> 13:59:45.920]  to that area of the Atlantic,
[13:59:45.920 --> 13:59:47.920]  I think in Norway, near Norway,
[13:59:47.920 --> 13:59:50.920]  because underwater UFOs were tagging the nets
[13:59:50.920 --> 13:59:53.920]  of the fishing vessels and causing general mayhem,
[13:59:53.920 --> 13:59:56.920]  and the US Navy turned up on the scene
[13:59:56.920 --> 13:59:58.920]  and put an exclusion zone in place,
[13:59:58.920 --> 14:00:01.920]  and the consequences of that, as I understand it,
[14:00:01.920 --> 14:00:03.920]  was a ship disappeared.
[14:00:03.920 --> 14:00:07.920]  So you're dealing with something that is certainly very mysterious
[14:00:07.920 --> 14:00:09.920]  in terms of underwater bases,
[14:00:09.920 --> 14:00:11.920]  and I mean Christopher Columbus,
[14:00:11.920 --> 14:00:14.920]  he recorded that when he was touring to America,
[14:00:14.920 --> 14:00:16.920]  when he was sailing to America,
[14:00:16.920 --> 14:00:20.920]  he actually saw an underwater UFO appear
[14:00:20.920 --> 14:00:22.920]  and fly off at speed from him.
[14:00:22.920 --> 14:00:27.920]  So the oceans of our planet are definitely populated with them,
[14:00:27.920 --> 14:00:31.920]  and I think that we have got intelligences out there
[14:00:31.920 --> 14:00:33.920]  that are non-human intelligence,
[14:00:33.920 --> 14:00:36.920]  that are peaceful and occupy our planet's ocean
[14:00:36.920 --> 14:00:39.920]  as a matter of course, and have been for centuries.
[14:00:39.920 --> 14:00:42.920]  Let me just fire a few more at you.
[14:00:42.920 --> 14:00:45.920]  You talked about disappearing ships.
[14:00:45.920 --> 14:00:48.920]  Philadelphia experiment, I'm sure you've heard of that one.
[14:00:48.920 --> 14:00:50.920]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[14:00:50.920 --> 14:00:52.920]  Humps or not?
[14:00:52.920 --> 14:00:54.920]  I think that was a hoax.
[14:00:54.920 --> 14:00:57.920]  If you, interestingly enough, and this may sound odd,
[14:00:57.920 --> 14:01:00.920]  if anybody wants to look at the answers for things,
[14:01:00.920 --> 14:01:02.920]  look at what the Russians are saying about some of these issues.
[14:01:02.920 --> 14:01:04.920]  They're very revealing.
[14:01:04.920 --> 14:01:07.920]  Some of the Russian military guys and the KGB guys,
[14:01:07.920 --> 14:01:10.920]  they seem to know the score on a lot of things mysteriously,
[14:01:10.920 --> 14:01:13.920]  but I think that was a hoax, hoax on that one.
[14:01:13.920 --> 14:01:17.920]  Bob Lazar claimed to have back-engineered
[14:01:17.920 --> 14:01:20.920]  UFOs at Nevada 51 back in the late 80s,
[14:01:20.920 --> 14:01:23.920]  then came out very publicly afterwards with his story.
[14:01:23.920 --> 14:01:25.920]  Bob Lazar hoax or not hoax?
[14:01:25.920 --> 14:01:27.920]  I mean, two minds about that one, Paul.
[14:01:27.920 --> 14:01:29.920]  I am. I mean, two minds about that one.
[14:01:29.920 --> 14:01:31.920]  Bob Lazar...
[14:01:31.920 --> 14:01:33.920]  Yeah, I mean, two minds. I don't know.
[14:01:33.920 --> 14:01:35.920]  I don't know what to believe on that issue.
[14:01:35.920 --> 14:01:37.920]  A bit like yourself with the reptilians.
[14:01:37.920 --> 14:01:39.920]  I don't know what to believe on that one.
[14:01:39.920 --> 14:01:41.920]  I don't.
[14:01:41.920 --> 14:01:44.920]  I think Sir Peter Horsley was it?
[14:01:44.920 --> 14:01:47.920]  He was a pretty prominent British officer
[14:01:47.920 --> 14:01:50.920]  who claimed to have met an alien.
[14:01:50.920 --> 14:01:54.920]  Yeah, yeah, indeed. Now, I strongly believe in that one.
[14:01:54.920 --> 14:01:57.920]  And there has been incidents...
[14:01:57.920 --> 14:01:59.920]  incidents occur, bizarre incidents occur,
[14:01:59.920 --> 14:02:02.920]  where people who...
[14:02:02.920 --> 14:02:05.920]  NATO did a research thing, Paul,
[14:02:05.920 --> 14:02:07.920]  called the assessment, so it is said.
[14:02:07.920 --> 14:02:10.920]  This was said by Master Sergeant Robert Dean.
[14:02:10.920 --> 14:02:13.920]  But basically, the gist of the report was about UFOs
[14:02:13.920 --> 14:02:15.920]  because they were triggering...
[14:02:15.920 --> 14:02:17.920]  they nearly triggered World War III on a number of occasions.
[14:02:17.920 --> 14:02:19.920]  But the thing is, what was happening there
[14:02:19.920 --> 14:02:21.920]  was the NATO said that you had aliens
[14:02:21.920 --> 14:02:23.920]  that looked like us, exactly like us.
[14:02:23.920 --> 14:02:25.920]  You could walk past one down the street
[14:02:25.920 --> 14:02:27.920]  and you would never know, was the famous quote.
[14:02:27.920 --> 14:02:29.920]  You would literally never know.
[14:02:29.920 --> 14:02:33.920]  And so Peter Horsley was sat with somebody
[14:02:33.920 --> 14:02:36.920]  who knew about Britain's nuclear program
[14:02:36.920 --> 14:02:39.920]  backwards way on and knew a lot of other things as well.
[14:02:39.920 --> 14:02:41.920]  He was a man called Janice,
[14:02:41.920 --> 14:02:44.920]  although I was misquoted on the UK Radio Station Talksport
[14:02:44.920 --> 14:02:47.920]  and they thought I said the word Janice.
[14:02:47.920 --> 14:02:51.920]  And then that all went off into this humongous black comedy
[14:02:51.920 --> 14:02:53.920]  of, oh, did you see a cleaner?
[14:02:53.920 --> 14:02:55.920]  Was he knocking off, Janice? It was quite hilarious.
[14:02:55.920 --> 14:02:58.920]  The clips on my YouTube site with George Galloway,
[14:02:58.920 --> 14:03:00.920]  it was very funny.
[14:03:00.920 --> 14:03:02.920]  Yeah, oh, you've heard it, have you, Paul?
[14:03:02.920 --> 14:03:04.920]  Right, yeah, it was very funny.
[14:03:04.920 --> 14:03:06.920]  But yeah, so Peter Horsley had an incident
[14:03:06.920 --> 14:03:08.920]  with the brakes on his car.
[14:03:08.920 --> 14:03:11.920]  He nearly crashed his car. His brakes had been tampered with.
[14:03:11.920 --> 14:03:15.920]  So I'm one for believing that that happened.
[14:03:15.920 --> 14:03:19.920]  So we're running out of time, but TonyTopping.com,
[14:03:19.920 --> 14:03:22.920]  final statement, give your website a plug
[14:03:22.920 --> 14:03:24.920]  and just conclude it here.
[14:03:24.920 --> 14:03:27.920]  I mean, how does this tie into the info war?
[14:03:27.920 --> 14:03:29.920]  Give us a concluding statement.
[14:03:29.920 --> 14:03:31.920]  It does indeed tie into the info war
[14:03:31.920 --> 14:03:33.920]  because what you're doing is you're showing
[14:03:33.920 --> 14:03:36.920]  one level of reality that is going on around us.
[14:03:36.920 --> 14:03:38.920]  What you're seeing is something that is happening
[14:03:38.920 --> 14:03:40.920]  straight in front of your eyes.
[14:03:40.920 --> 14:03:43.920]  The agenda is plain and it is in front of you,
[14:03:43.920 --> 14:03:45.920]  but there are some of us who are engaged
[14:03:45.920 --> 14:03:48.920]  in the kind of the next level up of what's driving it all,
[14:03:48.920 --> 14:03:51.920]  what's going on, whether we like it or not.
[14:03:51.920 --> 14:03:54.920]  And I think the other issue is before info wars listeners,
[14:03:54.920 --> 14:03:56.920]  because you're a hard crowd to please,
[14:03:56.920 --> 14:03:59.920]  and Alex Jones, who's a hard person to please as well,
[14:03:59.920 --> 14:04:02.920]  and yourself, you're critical thinkers and researchers,
[14:04:02.920 --> 14:04:05.920]  I'd like to see a bit more about the UFO researchers
[14:04:05.920 --> 14:04:08.920]  being harassed and the consequences of all that
[14:04:08.920 --> 14:04:10.920]  and the human factor behind it all.
[14:04:10.920 --> 14:04:13.920]  And I think that would be of great beneficial service.
[14:04:13.920 --> 14:04:16.920]  If researchers in UFOs aren't giving answers,
[14:04:16.920 --> 14:04:19.920]  let's hope people like yourself and people like Alex Jones
[14:04:19.920 --> 14:04:22.920]  can give people proper answers as to what's going on.
[14:04:22.920 --> 14:04:24.920]  And my site's TonyTopping.com.
[14:04:24.920 --> 14:04:26.920]  I am on Facebook and I am on Twitter.
[14:04:26.920 --> 14:04:29.920]  And thank you, Paul, for having me on the show.
[14:04:29.920 --> 14:04:31.920]  Really appreciate it, Tony.
[14:04:31.920 --> 14:04:33.920]  Take care. Thanks for being on the show.
[14:04:33.920 --> 14:04:35.920]  I've been very interested in this morning.
[14:04:35.920 --> 14:04:36.920]  Thank you very much, mate,
[14:04:36.920 --> 14:04:39.920]  and good luck with the project that you're working on.
[14:04:39.920 --> 14:04:41.920]  Thanks, Tony. There goes TonyTopping,
[14:04:41.920 --> 14:04:45.920]  UFO researcher, TonyTopping.com.
[14:04:45.920 --> 14:04:48.920]  Now we're going to hand it over to Richard Reeves
[14:04:48.920 --> 14:04:51.920]  back in the Austin command base.
[14:04:51.920 --> 14:04:53.920]  Richard, are you with me?
[14:04:53.920 --> 14:04:55.920]  Yes, sir. Mr. Watson, how are you doing over there
[14:04:55.920 --> 14:04:57.920]  across the pond?
[14:04:57.920 --> 14:05:00.920]  Have you ever been abducted by aliens, Richard?
[14:05:00.920 --> 14:05:01.920]  Well, thankfully not,
[14:05:01.920 --> 14:05:04.920]  and hopefully I can avoid that in the upcoming near
[14:05:04.920 --> 14:05:07.920]  and long-term future as well, hopefully.
[14:05:07.920 --> 14:05:10.920]  Have you managed to get much sleep?
[14:05:10.920 --> 14:05:12.920]  What with the 24-hour marathon going on?
[14:05:12.920 --> 14:05:15.920]  Well, I did go home, I guess, around midnight
[14:05:15.920 --> 14:05:17.920]  and laid down for a while and tossed and turned
[14:05:17.920 --> 14:05:20.920]  in the proverbial bed there
[14:05:20.920 --> 14:05:23.920]  and got up about four o'clock here at Texas time
[14:05:23.920 --> 14:05:26.920]  and ready to rip and roar here, hopefully.
[14:05:26.920 --> 14:05:29.920]  OK, Richard, I'm going to hand it over then.
[14:05:29.920 --> 14:05:31.920]  Tell us about your guests and what information
[14:05:31.920 --> 14:05:32.920]  you're going to cover.
[14:05:32.920 --> 14:05:34.920]  I'll say goodbye to the Info Warriors
[14:05:34.920 --> 14:05:37.920]  and please donate InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[14:05:37.920 --> 14:05:38.920]  I'm signing off.
[14:05:38.920 --> 14:05:41.920]  Paul Joseph Watson, handing over to Richard Reeves.
[14:05:41.920 --> 14:05:43.920]  Thank you, Commander Watson.
[14:05:43.920 --> 14:05:46.920]  Well, welcome, Info Warriors.
[14:05:46.920 --> 14:05:49.920]  It is Friday, going into the second day of the Money Bomb,
[14:05:49.920 --> 14:05:53.920]  completing the 27-hour marathon.
[14:05:53.920 --> 14:05:55.920]  We'll be wrapping up today.
[14:05:55.920 --> 14:05:57.920]  Alex will be in here later at 7 a.m.
[14:05:57.920 --> 14:05:59.920]  Texas time in an hour.
[14:05:59.920 --> 14:06:03.920]  We're going to have an interview with Charlotte Isherby
[14:06:03.920 --> 14:06:04.920]  that we're going to play.
[14:06:04.920 --> 14:06:07.920]  And at 8 o'clock Texas time,
[14:06:07.920 --> 14:06:09.920]  Gerald Salente will be coming on live
[14:06:09.920 --> 14:06:13.920]  to guest host the program via Skype.
[14:06:13.920 --> 14:06:16.920]  So make sure and stay tuned in for the final hours
[14:06:16.920 --> 14:06:19.920]  if you've held in already this long,
[14:06:19.920 --> 14:06:23.920]  going on, what, 20-some-odd hours right now.
[14:06:23.920 --> 14:06:25.920]  Hopefully, you'll continue being able to listen
[14:06:25.920 --> 14:06:27.920]  and watch what's been going on here
[14:06:27.920 --> 14:06:29.920]  on the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[14:06:29.920 --> 14:06:31.920]  I want to thank Alex for allowing me to guest host
[14:06:31.920 --> 14:06:33.920]  what an honor and privilege it is.
[14:06:33.920 --> 14:06:36.920]  The guy is one of the hardest-working people
[14:06:36.920 --> 14:06:40.920]  on this planet, and it's just unbelievable
[14:06:40.920 --> 14:06:43.920]  the amount of workload and the amount of weight
[14:06:43.920 --> 14:06:45.920]  on the man's shoulders that he has to juggle.
[14:06:45.920 --> 14:06:47.920]  I don't know how he does it,
[14:06:47.920 --> 14:06:49.920]  but he manages to make it happen.
[14:06:49.920 --> 14:06:52.920]  And this audience has to be commended
[14:06:52.920 --> 14:06:54.920]  for everything they do.
[14:06:54.920 --> 14:06:57.920]  This audience is the most awesome audience on the planet.
[14:06:57.920 --> 14:07:01.920]  I've been a long-term listener of AM Radio,
[14:07:01.920 --> 14:07:04.920]  Talk Radio ever since, I guess, the late 70s,
[14:07:04.920 --> 14:07:07.920]  drove professionally for many years.
[14:07:07.920 --> 14:07:12.920]  It is my main career, and Talk Radio has been my friend,
[14:07:12.920 --> 14:07:17.920]  and that's how I found Alex back in 1997, 98.
[14:07:17.920 --> 14:07:20.920]  Right here in Austin, he was on 98.9 KJFK
[14:07:20.920 --> 14:07:22.920]  way back around 1998,
[14:07:22.920 --> 14:07:24.920]  and I traveled through Austin frequently,
[14:07:24.920 --> 14:07:27.920]  and I'd make sure and tune in to Alex Jones
[14:07:27.920 --> 14:07:29.920]  back there on 98.9 FM,
[14:07:29.920 --> 14:07:34.920]  and I've been a listener and now a long-time friend
[14:07:34.920 --> 14:07:39.920]  for many years, so I appreciate the audience
[14:07:39.920 --> 14:07:41.920]  because I've been one of the audience members
[14:07:41.920 --> 14:07:45.920]  for many years, and in fact still am one of the audience members,
[14:07:45.920 --> 14:07:49.920]  and this audience will be ultimately the Paul reveres
[14:07:49.920 --> 14:07:52.920]  that make the big difference in this world.
[14:07:52.920 --> 14:07:54.920]  It's not going to be just the United States now.
[14:07:54.920 --> 14:07:57.920]  The Paul reveres are going to be across the world,
[14:07:57.920 --> 14:08:01.920]  around the world, taking on the New World Order.
[14:08:01.920 --> 14:08:06.920]  Back in the 1770s, 1776, those years,
[14:08:06.920 --> 14:08:08.920]  it was about the 13 colonies.
[14:08:08.920 --> 14:08:11.920]  It was about starting this country back then,
[14:08:11.920 --> 14:08:15.920]  and now this is going to be a global event
[14:08:15.920 --> 14:08:18.920]  because of the communications, the internet,
[14:08:18.920 --> 14:08:21.920]  what we're doing right now on the web.
[14:08:21.920 --> 14:08:24.920]  It's going to be a very interesting time
[14:08:24.920 --> 14:08:26.920]  and has been an interesting time.
[14:08:26.920 --> 14:08:29.920]  It's like one of the things I've been saying here lately
[14:08:29.920 --> 14:08:32.920]  is who would have thought right after 9-11,
[14:08:32.920 --> 14:08:36.920]  especially for those of you that were awake about the New World Order
[14:08:36.920 --> 14:08:40.920]  and that were aware of what was going on with the world
[14:08:40.920 --> 14:08:43.920]  and the geopolitical environment that we were in.
[14:08:43.920 --> 14:08:48.920]  Think back to 9-11 of 2001 during those events,
[14:08:48.920 --> 14:08:54.920]  and there were just a very small minority of people
[14:08:54.920 --> 14:08:58.920]  knowing that this was a New World Order event inside job
[14:08:58.920 --> 14:09:00.920]  to further their police state agenda,
[14:09:00.920 --> 14:09:02.920]  to further the surveillance society,
[14:09:02.920 --> 14:09:04.920]  to further all of their agenda,
[14:09:04.920 --> 14:09:10.920]  and that the police state at that time in the fall of 2001
[14:09:10.920 --> 14:09:12.920]  just seemed so imminent.
[14:09:12.920 --> 14:09:16.920]  It just seemed like, wow, it was all going to come crashing down.
[14:09:16.920 --> 14:09:18.920]  The police state was going to come down on us
[14:09:18.920 --> 14:09:22.920]  and really clamp down on our freedoms.
[14:09:22.920 --> 14:09:25.920]  Yet here we are by some miracle,
[14:09:25.920 --> 14:09:29.920]  and I think in large part to people like Alex Jones
[14:09:29.920 --> 14:09:34.920]  and to you guys, all of you folks out there in this audience
[14:09:34.920 --> 14:09:37.920]  that have taken the steps to fight against the New World Order.
[14:09:37.920 --> 14:09:43.920]  Here we are 10 years post 9-11 when it seemed like, bam,
[14:09:43.920 --> 14:09:45.920]  the police state was imminent.
[14:09:45.920 --> 14:09:48.920]  That's when I first met Alex was in the fall of 2001.
[14:09:48.920 --> 14:09:50.920]  I thought after that 9-11 event,
[14:09:50.920 --> 14:09:52.920]  I not only had to listen to this man on the radio
[14:09:52.920 --> 14:09:54.920]  and see him on access to cable TV,
[14:09:54.920 --> 14:09:56.920]  but I had to go meet the man,
[14:09:56.920 --> 14:09:58.920]  and so I went up there to access cable TV
[14:09:58.920 --> 14:10:00.920]  and met him, and I had some hot little stories
[14:10:00.920 --> 14:10:02.920]  that I thought I'd found on hand,
[14:10:02.920 --> 14:10:05.920]  but of course Alex is always one step ahead of almost everybody.
[14:10:05.920 --> 14:10:08.920]  He knew about every story I had to give him.
[14:10:08.920 --> 14:10:11.920]  But anyway, here we are.
[14:10:11.920 --> 14:10:14.920]  We've got still a pretty high level of freedom
[14:10:14.920 --> 14:10:15.920]  in the United States.
[14:10:15.920 --> 14:10:17.920]  The First Amendment is still thankfully alive.
[14:10:17.920 --> 14:10:19.920]  The Second Amendment is still going strong
[14:10:19.920 --> 14:10:22.920]  with a lot of folks waking up about that on the left side,
[14:10:22.920 --> 14:10:27.920]  especially we've had Obama be the number one gun salesman.
[14:10:27.920 --> 14:10:30.920]  You know, I got to give credit to Obama.
[14:10:30.920 --> 14:10:32.920]  People are always shocked whenever I say,
[14:10:32.920 --> 14:10:34.920]  you know, I really got to give Obama some credit
[14:10:34.920 --> 14:10:36.920]  about at least two things.
[14:10:36.920 --> 14:10:38.920]  I got to give him credit.
[14:10:38.920 --> 14:10:40.920]  Number one thing I give Obama credit for
[14:10:40.920 --> 14:10:44.920]  is he's been the best gun salesman on the planet,
[14:10:44.920 --> 14:10:48.920]  bar none, Obama number one gun salesman.
[14:10:48.920 --> 14:10:52.920]  I just never will forget those stories about, excuse me.
[14:10:55.920 --> 14:10:57.920]  I'm sorry, folks, I haven't been the same
[14:10:57.920 --> 14:11:00.920]  since the red tie down at South Padre,
[14:11:00.920 --> 14:11:05.920]  but Obama number one gun salesman ever.
[14:11:05.920 --> 14:11:08.920]  It's been amazing how those stories came out
[14:11:08.920 --> 14:11:10.920]  when he was first elected,
[14:11:10.920 --> 14:11:12.920]  how people rushed out and bought guns.
[14:11:12.920 --> 14:11:15.920]  So I think those articles and those stories
[14:11:15.920 --> 14:11:18.920]  had to give the New World Order boys some pause
[14:11:18.920 --> 14:11:23.920]  and a little bit of apprehension in them realizing
[14:11:23.920 --> 14:11:25.920]  what I think part of what's going on
[14:11:25.920 --> 14:11:28.920]  is they're actually building their own prison planet
[14:11:28.920 --> 14:11:30.920]  for themselves if they're not careful.
[14:11:30.920 --> 14:11:32.920]  And I think that's one reason
[14:11:32.920 --> 14:11:34.920]  they've really slowed down their agenda.
[14:11:34.920 --> 14:11:36.920]  But the number two thing
[14:11:36.920 --> 14:11:38.920]  I've got to give Obama credit for
[14:11:38.920 --> 14:11:41.920]  what happened just last November,
[14:11:41.920 --> 14:11:44.920]  just last November of 2010,
[14:11:44.920 --> 14:11:46.920]  I really got to give him credit
[14:11:46.920 --> 14:11:51.920]  because he had over 400 plus years worth of tenure
[14:11:51.920 --> 14:11:54.920]  fired out of the House and Senate.
[14:11:54.920 --> 14:11:57.920]  You had a lot of long-term incumbents,
[14:11:57.920 --> 14:11:59.920]  especially Democrat side,
[14:11:59.920 --> 14:12:01.920]  and Lord knows there's plenty of incumbents
[14:12:01.920 --> 14:12:04.920]  need to be fired on both sides of the aisle.
[14:12:04.920 --> 14:12:07.920]  I'll tell you, I've been one of the leaders,
[14:12:07.920 --> 14:12:09.920]  one of the lone voices out there
[14:12:09.920 --> 14:12:12.920]  that we need to fire just pretty much every incumbent.
[14:12:12.920 --> 14:12:14.920]  And thankfully, this audience I know
[14:12:14.920 --> 14:12:16.920]  is receptive to that idea.
[14:12:16.920 --> 14:12:18.920]  And I know they've heard that word
[14:12:18.920 --> 14:12:20.920]  that we definitely need to fire every incumbent.
[14:12:20.920 --> 14:12:22.920]  And the primaries are the Achilles heels.
[14:12:22.920 --> 14:12:26.920]  But Obama, I got to give him credit on that one,
[14:12:26.920 --> 14:12:28.920]  firing over 400 years worth of incumbents
[14:12:28.920 --> 14:12:31.920]  in the House and Senate in this last election
[14:12:31.920 --> 14:12:34.920]  because of his unpopularity.
[14:12:34.920 --> 14:12:36.920]  I tell you, I think he's created himself
[14:12:36.920 --> 14:12:38.920]  not only a lot of enemies on the right,
[14:12:38.920 --> 14:12:39.920]  which he's always had,
[14:12:39.920 --> 14:12:41.920]  but I think now,
[14:12:41.920 --> 14:12:43.920]  to this upcoming 2012 election cycle,
[14:12:43.920 --> 14:12:46.920]  Obama has created himself a lot of enemies
[14:12:46.920 --> 14:12:51.920]  on the left from his Democrat past friends
[14:12:51.920 --> 14:12:54.920]  that ended up having their rearing sent home
[14:12:54.920 --> 14:12:56.920]  from the House and Senate.
[14:12:56.920 --> 14:12:58.920]  So you've got most likely
[14:12:58.920 --> 14:13:01.920]  a lot of disgruntled people on the left
[14:13:01.920 --> 14:13:04.920]  and on the Democrat side that are ready to see Obama
[14:13:04.920 --> 14:13:06.920]  get fired as well.
[14:13:06.920 --> 14:13:09.920]  So that's going to be interesting to see how that plays out
[14:13:09.920 --> 14:13:13.920]  because that mentality of, hey, he's our Democrat.
[14:13:13.920 --> 14:13:16.920]  Yeah, we got a bunch of our people fired
[14:13:16.920 --> 14:13:19.920]  and they lost their jobs on Capitol Hill
[14:13:19.920 --> 14:13:21.920]  and the House and Senate.
[14:13:21.920 --> 14:13:24.920]  And of course, a lot of staffers got flushed with that.
[14:13:24.920 --> 14:13:26.920]  So not only are you talking about
[14:13:26.920 --> 14:13:29.920]  the individual US House members and senators,
[14:13:29.920 --> 14:13:32.920]  but you're also talking about big time,
[14:13:32.920 --> 14:13:35.920]  who knows how many millions and millions of dollars
[14:13:35.920 --> 14:13:39.920]  worth of payroll staff, people being fired
[14:13:39.920 --> 14:13:41.920]  and furloughed as well.
[14:13:41.920 --> 14:13:44.920]  Now, many of these guys, they always don't fall too far away
[14:13:44.920 --> 14:13:46.920]  and they end up getting gigs with some of the other people.
[14:13:46.920 --> 14:13:49.920]  As you all know, one of the best economies
[14:13:49.920 --> 14:13:52.920]  in the United States is Washington, D.C.
[14:13:52.920 --> 14:13:56.920]  and it just seems to somehow keep on miraculously growing
[14:13:56.920 --> 14:13:58.920]  and getting bigger and bigger and fatter.
[14:13:58.920 --> 14:14:02.920]  And some of the highest incomes in the country
[14:14:02.920 --> 14:14:04.920]  are in Washington, D.C.
[14:14:04.920 --> 14:14:07.920]  And so I'm sure many of you guys that keep up with the economy
[14:14:07.920 --> 14:14:09.920]  have heard about that story.
[14:14:09.920 --> 14:14:12.920]  All right, so Obama gets credit for two big things
[14:14:12.920 --> 14:14:17.920]  and hopefully in 2012, after the November election,
[14:14:17.920 --> 14:14:20.920]  I can give him credit for firing another
[14:14:20.920 --> 14:14:23.920]  four or 500 years worth of incumbents.
[14:14:23.920 --> 14:14:25.920]  That's what I'm looking forward to.
[14:14:25.920 --> 14:14:27.920]  Hopefully it'd be even more.
[14:14:27.920 --> 14:14:30.920]  I'd like to see a thousand years worth of incumbents.
[14:14:30.920 --> 14:14:33.920]  And when I say these thousand years,
[14:14:33.920 --> 14:14:36.920]  what I'm referring to is the number of years
[14:14:36.920 --> 14:14:38.920]  that some of these House members and Senate members
[14:14:38.920 --> 14:14:43.920]  have been up there in these positions of power up in D.C.
[14:14:43.920 --> 14:14:46.920]  Many of these Democrats have been there 20 and 30 years,
[14:14:46.920 --> 14:14:50.920]  long time US House members that got fired
[14:14:50.920 --> 14:14:53.920]  and that's how you come up with these cumulative figures
[14:14:53.920 --> 14:14:57.920]  of 400 plus years of incumbency.
[14:14:57.920 --> 14:15:01.920]  Okay, back in the spring, changing subjects and changing gears
[14:15:01.920 --> 14:15:04.920]  into a different topic, back in the spring,
[14:15:04.920 --> 14:15:06.920]  we were experiencing gasoline,
[14:15:06.920 --> 14:15:09.920]  climbing higher and higher in price
[14:15:09.920 --> 14:15:12.920]  and a lot of that was due to the activity in the Middle East
[14:15:12.920 --> 14:15:15.920]  that was going on driven by the New World Order there in Libya
[14:15:15.920 --> 14:15:19.920]  and also in other Middle Eastern countries.
[14:15:19.920 --> 14:15:22.920]  And one of the interesting topics of research
[14:15:22.920 --> 14:15:25.920]  that I kind of got into and started kind of connecting
[14:15:25.920 --> 14:15:29.920]  the dots with was with regard to energy and power.
[14:15:29.920 --> 14:15:32.920]  And I've been meaning to get with Alex for a while
[14:15:32.920 --> 14:15:35.920]  and try to come on the program and cover this topic.
[14:15:35.920 --> 14:15:38.920]  And so me being a fill-in host for this hour
[14:15:38.920 --> 14:15:41.920]  till 7 a.m. Texas time is a perfect opportunity
[14:15:41.920 --> 14:15:45.920]  for me to kind of discuss what I learned and found out
[14:15:45.920 --> 14:15:49.920]  with regards to energy and how it's connected to the economy,
[14:15:49.920 --> 14:15:53.920]  connected to the New World Order and their agenda.
[14:15:53.920 --> 14:15:56.920]  And one of the things, like I said, that was going on back
[14:15:56.920 --> 14:16:00.920]  in the spring of 2011 is we did see accelerating
[14:16:00.920 --> 14:16:05.920]  and climbing gasoline, oil prices, diesel prices, et cetera.
[14:16:05.920 --> 14:16:09.920]  And I really got curious as to, you know,
[14:16:09.920 --> 14:16:11.920]  what are all the things that they need to do?
[14:16:11.920 --> 14:16:13.920]  You know, Lindsey Williams had come on here.
[14:16:13.920 --> 14:16:15.920]  Most of you guys out there in the audience are familiar
[14:16:15.920 --> 14:16:17.920]  with Lindsey Williams and he was talking about
[14:16:17.920 --> 14:16:21.920]  where the NWO plans to take gasoline and oil prices, et cetera.
[14:16:21.920 --> 14:16:25.920]  And so I got interested in, okay, what all needs to happen?
[14:16:25.920 --> 14:16:30.920]  What all does the NWO need to do to control these prices?
[14:16:30.920 --> 14:16:35.920]  Because they have a lot of control over the prices
[14:16:35.920 --> 14:16:38.920]  of oil and gasoline, obviously, and they've demonstrated that.
[14:16:38.920 --> 14:16:41.920]  But at the same time, they are at the whim
[14:16:41.920 --> 14:16:43.920]  of the market a little bit somewhat
[14:16:43.920 --> 14:16:47.920]  because there's independent-minded companies out there
[14:16:47.920 --> 14:16:51.920]  and there's the big corporate giants that are running gasoline
[14:16:51.920 --> 14:16:52.920]  and diesel and oil.
[14:16:52.920 --> 14:16:54.920]  There's the exons and the mobiles,
[14:16:54.920 --> 14:16:57.920]  and then you've got the countries that have their own interests
[14:16:57.920 --> 14:17:00.920]  and you've got Hugo Chavez and Venezuela
[14:17:00.920 --> 14:17:06.920]  and all these different players that work together
[14:17:06.920 --> 14:17:10.920]  and disparately to end up controlling all these prices.
[14:17:10.920 --> 14:17:14.920]  And the NWO at the top of it all trying to pull the puppet strings
[14:17:14.920 --> 14:17:18.920]  one way or another about how those prices fall
[14:17:18.920 --> 14:17:21.920]  and how they go and who gets supply and who doesn't.
[14:17:21.920 --> 14:17:24.920]  But one of the things that really caught my eye
[14:17:24.920 --> 14:17:28.920]  was I was doing a little bit of research on stock issues
[14:17:28.920 --> 14:17:30.920]  and stock market things, and I ran across a story
[14:17:30.920 --> 14:17:33.920]  about a pipeline company up in Oklahoma.
[14:17:33.920 --> 14:17:39.920]  And the story was saying how that back in around March, April of 2011
[14:17:39.920 --> 14:17:43.920]  that this pipeline company up in Oklahoma could not keep up
[14:17:43.920 --> 14:17:47.920]  with the supply of oil that was needing to be shipped
[14:17:47.920 --> 14:17:49.920]  out of Cushing, Oklahoma.
[14:17:49.920 --> 14:17:52.920]  There was a lot of oil being shipped out of Cushing, Oklahoma
[14:17:52.920 --> 14:17:56.920]  and that they could only handle, I think it was about 10 or 12%
[14:17:56.920 --> 14:17:58.920]  of the supply of oil out of Cushing.
[14:17:58.920 --> 14:18:01.920]  And I was thinking, well, at first blush,
[14:18:01.920 --> 14:18:06.920]  the story didn't talk about exactly where the supply was from Cushing.
[14:18:06.920 --> 14:18:08.920]  They were just saying it was in Cushing, Oklahoma.
[14:18:08.920 --> 14:18:12.920]  And I was just kind of basically at the time of first blush on that story
[14:18:12.920 --> 14:18:15.920]  thinking that, wow, they must be pumping a lot of oil
[14:18:15.920 --> 14:18:19.920]  out of the ground in Cushing or around Cushing, Oklahoma
[14:18:19.920 --> 14:18:24.920]  to have that much of an overage in supply of oil.
[14:18:24.920 --> 14:18:27.920]  And lo and behold, a few days later I thought, you know,
[14:18:27.920 --> 14:18:29.920]  I got curious about that story and I said,
[14:18:29.920 --> 14:18:32.920]  where's the oil coming from in Cushing, Oklahoma?
[14:18:32.920 --> 14:18:35.920]  And what I found out on deeper investigation is that
[14:18:35.920 --> 14:18:40.920]  since the 2008 and probably before that,
[14:18:40.920 --> 14:18:43.920]  independent companies, entrepreneurs, speculators,
[14:18:43.920 --> 14:18:47.920]  different entities have built these big giant tank farms
[14:18:47.920 --> 14:18:50.920]  all over the country and Cushing, Oklahoma is one of them.
[14:18:50.920 --> 14:18:53.920]  They built these giant tank farms and they filled them up with oil
[14:18:53.920 --> 14:18:56.920]  and they bought oil when it was cheaper
[14:18:56.920 --> 14:18:59.920]  and waited for time to release that oil
[14:18:59.920 --> 14:19:02.920]  and try to cash in and make profit, of course.
[14:19:02.920 --> 14:19:06.920]  But also, I think these big tank farms all around the country,
[14:19:06.920 --> 14:19:11.920]  which by the way, Cushing, Oklahoma is supposedly only represents
[14:19:11.920 --> 14:19:17.920]  about 8 or 10% of the oil that is stored by such entities.
[14:19:17.920 --> 14:19:19.920]  So it's only a small percentage.
[14:19:19.920 --> 14:19:24.920]  So if Cushing, Oklahoma was needing to pump oil
[14:19:24.920 --> 14:19:27.920]  and not having the supply of the pipelines
[14:19:27.920 --> 14:19:29.920]  to get it to the Mississippi River Valley
[14:19:29.920 --> 14:19:33.920]  where a lot of refineries are to get it to the big refinery areas
[14:19:33.920 --> 14:19:37.920]  like around Houston and Texas, areas like that,
[14:19:37.920 --> 14:19:39.920]  they lack the pipeline capacity
[14:19:39.920 --> 14:19:43.920]  and could only handle about 10% or 12% of the oil coming out of Cushing
[14:19:43.920 --> 14:19:45.920]  and that's just one of the locations
[14:19:45.920 --> 14:19:50.920]  and that only represents about 10% of the oil
[14:19:50.920 --> 14:19:54.920]  that is stored in the above ground and underground tanks.
[14:19:54.920 --> 14:20:01.920]  So that, I think, helped slow down the increase in price
[14:20:01.920 --> 14:20:04.920]  at that time in the spring, but I'm also believing now
[14:20:04.920 --> 14:20:08.920]  that the NWO is probably going back to their drawing board
[14:20:08.920 --> 14:20:10.920]  and thinking, wow, we were really looking forward
[14:20:10.920 --> 14:20:15.920]  to having gasoline costing $6, $7, $8 a gallon in the United States
[14:20:15.920 --> 14:20:18.920]  and I think they actually kind of ran into an overhead supply
[14:20:18.920 --> 14:20:25.920]  that they may not have completely realized, anticipated, and expected
[14:20:25.920 --> 14:20:29.920]  and then on top of that, you've got the issues of oil being discovered
[14:20:29.920 --> 14:20:31.920]  all over the world.
[14:20:31.920 --> 14:20:33.920]  You've got a big Canadian find
[14:20:33.920 --> 14:20:36.920]  that they're trying to build a pipeline down in the United States
[14:20:36.920 --> 14:20:38.920]  and I think they'll end up getting that done probably
[14:20:38.920 --> 14:20:41.920]  because there's a lot of lobbying efforts to create the jobs
[14:20:41.920 --> 14:20:44.920]  that those pipelines would bring out of Canada
[14:20:44.920 --> 14:20:46.920]  and let me just say this up front,
[14:20:46.920 --> 14:20:48.920]  I love cars.
[14:20:48.920 --> 14:20:54.920]  I think men in general are somehow instinctively just love
[14:20:54.920 --> 14:20:56.920]  the automobile here in the United States
[14:20:56.920 --> 14:20:58.920]  and we're blessed to be here in the United States
[14:20:58.920 --> 14:21:01.920]  where the automobile basically, when it comes to personal transportation,
[14:21:01.920 --> 14:21:04.920]  has been king and is king
[14:21:04.920 --> 14:21:07.920]  and I think it's a symbol of American freedom.
[14:21:07.920 --> 14:21:10.920]  You know, that old Southwest Airlines, the symbol of freedom,
[14:21:10.920 --> 14:21:13.920]  they had the jet on the billboard, symbol of freedom.
[14:21:13.920 --> 14:21:17.920]  Well, I think the original symbol of freedom has been for us,
[14:21:17.920 --> 14:21:20.920]  the automobile, one of the symbols of freedom.
[14:21:20.920 --> 14:21:22.920]  We've got a lot here in the United States,
[14:21:22.920 --> 14:21:27.920]  but the automobile, definitely one of the major symbols of freedom
[14:21:27.920 --> 14:21:33.920]  and I've often said that they'll pry the car out of my cold dead hands
[14:21:33.920 --> 14:21:35.920]  kind of like that quote about the gun.
[14:21:35.920 --> 14:21:37.920]  You get my gun out of my cold dead hands.
[14:21:37.920 --> 14:21:40.920]  Well, that's the way it is with the automobile.
[14:21:40.920 --> 14:21:44.920]  I just love transportation and I don't think it should matter
[14:21:44.920 --> 14:21:50.920]  if we drive a little Ugo or a little mini Daihatsu or whatever
[14:21:50.920 --> 14:21:51.920]  or a Hummer.
[14:21:51.920 --> 14:21:56.920]  I don't think in America that that's the issue of what vehicle we drive
[14:21:56.920 --> 14:21:58.920]  or how big it is or whatever.
[14:21:58.920 --> 14:21:59.920]  I don't think that's the problem.
[14:21:59.920 --> 14:22:02.920]  The problem is what are we putting in our tanks?
[14:22:02.920 --> 14:22:04.920]  That is where the monopoly is
[14:22:04.920 --> 14:22:08.920]  and so that's why I've kind of delved in this subject about energy
[14:22:08.920 --> 14:22:12.920]  and there's a lot more connected dots that are upcoming
[14:22:12.920 --> 14:22:17.920]  that I kind of found out on what's going on with the overall situation with energy
[14:22:17.920 --> 14:22:24.920]  because the oil, like I said, they've been finding vast reserves up in Canada.
[14:22:24.920 --> 14:22:27.920]  You've got Lindsey Williams has talked about all the oil up in Alaska.
[14:22:27.920 --> 14:22:31.920]  You've got years and years, you know, by some accounts,
[14:22:31.920 --> 14:22:34.920]  100, 200 years worth of oil up in Alaska.
[14:22:34.920 --> 14:22:39.920]  And like I said, me loving cars, I don't want to get out of my car.
[14:22:39.920 --> 14:22:44.920]  You've got more and more cities trying to put us on rails, actually,
[14:22:44.920 --> 14:22:47.920]  literally on rails like in Austin and in many other cities.
[14:22:47.920 --> 14:22:52.920]  That's a big agenda in San Antonio, Houston, Austin, all over the world.
[14:22:52.920 --> 14:22:55.920]  That is a big agenda to get people out of their cars.
[14:22:55.920 --> 14:23:00.920]  And I'm not 100% against it, but when they want to put us out of our cars
[14:23:00.920 --> 14:23:04.920]  because of cost, then I really have a problem with that
[14:23:04.920 --> 14:23:09.920]  because I think transportation needs to remain inexpensive and accessible
[14:23:09.920 --> 14:23:12.920]  to everybody here in the United States.
[14:23:12.920 --> 14:23:16.920]  And the agenda definitely by the NWO is to put us out of those cars.
[14:23:16.920 --> 14:23:21.920]  But the cost of oil is a key factor in whether we remain in cars.
[14:23:21.920 --> 14:23:28.920]  But the other key factor is what are the alternatives ultimately going to be to oil
[14:23:28.920 --> 14:23:31.920]  because there will be alternatives and there are alternatives.
[14:23:31.920 --> 14:23:35.920]  I don't think we've come upon the best alternatives yet.
[14:23:35.920 --> 14:23:39.920]  I think the alternatives yet to come and maybe they're out there.
[14:23:39.920 --> 14:23:44.920]  You hear the stories about the 100 mile per gallon carburetors, et cetera.
[14:23:44.920 --> 14:23:49.920]  You hear all the different stories about ways to get better gas mileage.
[14:23:49.920 --> 14:23:55.920]  I really think these best methods of getting around our cars is yet to come.
[14:23:55.920 --> 14:24:00.920]  But for now, the NWO obsessed with control
[14:24:00.920 --> 14:24:04.920]  has really got their work cut out for them from my perspective from what I see.
[14:24:04.920 --> 14:24:09.920]  And it's a blessing for us that it looks like their work is so cut out
[14:24:09.920 --> 14:24:13.920]  because you've got these massive oil finds all around the planet.
[14:24:13.920 --> 14:24:17.920]  You've got a lot of offshore drilling going on in Brazil.
[14:24:17.920 --> 14:24:20.920]  It's a big giant oil field discoveries there.
[14:24:20.920 --> 14:24:22.920]  We've all heard about Venezuela and their oil,
[14:24:22.920 --> 14:24:26.920]  and there's probably oil that they've yet to discover here in the Gulf of Mexico.
[14:24:26.920 --> 14:24:31.920]  More and more because of the dilemma the NWO is in
[14:24:31.920 --> 14:24:36.920]  in trying to control the supply and demand and cost of oil.
[14:24:36.920 --> 14:24:42.920]  I really have to wonder about that deep horizon, the deep water horizon accident.
[14:24:42.920 --> 14:24:47.920]  I really have to start to wonder about that because it's interesting how,
[14:24:47.920 --> 14:24:54.920]  okay, we've got the deep water horizon accident basically slowing down
[14:24:54.920 --> 14:24:58.920]  and bogging down the Gulf of Mexico exploration.
[14:24:58.920 --> 14:25:06.920]  And you've got events like Fukushima that have damaged the nuclear industry.
[14:25:06.920 --> 14:25:10.920]  That may be the death knell of the growth of the nuclear industry.
[14:25:10.920 --> 14:25:14.920]  And I remember back, not that I'm necessarily a fan of nuclear,
[14:25:14.920 --> 14:25:18.920]  not really a fan of nuclear at all in a big way because
[14:25:18.920 --> 14:25:23.920]  we've still yet to figure out a way to deal properly with the waste of nuclear.
[14:25:23.920 --> 14:25:30.920]  But it's interesting that the growth of nuclear energy has been damaged by the Fukushima event.
[14:25:30.920 --> 14:25:34.920]  And who could blame countries around the world for really wanting to back off
[14:25:34.920 --> 14:25:38.920]  and scratch their head when they're looking at developing more nuclear plants
[14:25:38.920 --> 14:25:41.920]  thinking, wow, look at what happened in Fukushima.
[14:25:41.920 --> 14:25:46.920]  And also look at what happened with the flooding in Nebraska with the Calhoun plant,
[14:25:46.920 --> 14:25:53.920]  the Calhoun nuclear plant there in Nebraska that was by some reports actually flooded internally.
[14:25:53.920 --> 14:25:56.920]  And I haven't seen or read any stories on that lately.
[14:25:56.920 --> 14:26:03.920]  But it's interesting to note how that over the past few months and year,
[14:26:03.920 --> 14:26:10.920]  we've seen virtually almost all types of energy come under some level of attack.
[14:26:10.920 --> 14:26:18.920]  Some level of event, like with nuclear, like I was saying, Fukushima incident, Calhoun incident.
[14:26:18.920 --> 14:26:22.920]  And then there was another nuclear reactor up in Canada that had some problems.
[14:26:22.920 --> 14:26:29.920]  You've got coal under attack from the carbon emissions angle.
[14:26:29.920 --> 14:26:36.920]  And you've got coal, you've got Obama saying that, well, you can build a coal-fired power plant,
[14:26:36.920 --> 14:26:38.920]  but you'd go bankrupt.
[14:26:38.920 --> 14:26:41.920]  You remember that quote, I know Alex has played that on the air many times.
[14:26:41.920 --> 14:26:45.920]  So coal has been under attack for quite a while.
[14:26:45.920 --> 14:26:51.920]  Remember back in the 90s during the Clinton administration when some of the best coal in the world up in Utah
[14:26:51.920 --> 14:26:56.920]  was completely put off limits by, I think, a National Park designation.
[14:26:56.920 --> 14:27:01.920]  And I remember Bill Clinton going there and he wouldn't even go to Utah to do the speech.
[14:27:01.920 --> 14:27:11.920]  I think he ended up in Arizona south of Utah to make the big speech about how this land is now off limits for coal exploration.
[14:27:11.920 --> 14:27:19.920]  And the people of Utah were counting on a lot of that taxpayer money, the economic benefit of digging up coal
[14:27:19.920 --> 14:27:24.920]  to fund some of their education and all their state projects, things like that.
[14:27:24.920 --> 14:27:27.920]  So coal has been under a long-term attack.
[14:27:27.920 --> 14:27:34.920]  And then the other thing that I ran across is I'm studying all this about the oil in the spring of 2011.
[14:27:34.920 --> 14:27:36.920]  I'm studying about the Deepwater Horizon event.
[14:27:36.920 --> 14:27:38.920]  We've got Fukushima going on.
[14:27:38.920 --> 14:27:41.920]  We've got flooding in the Midwest with the Calhoun nuclear plant.
[14:27:41.920 --> 14:27:48.920]  We've got coal being attacked by governments and the global warming agenda.
[14:27:48.920 --> 14:27:58.920]  We've got one of the other things that I learned was under attack, especially with all the European economic debacle.
[14:27:58.920 --> 14:28:06.920]  And you've got a lot of countries that are backing away from their heavy spending habits.
[14:28:06.920 --> 14:28:15.920]  And one of the victims of governments backing off from all of their excess spending of money that they don't have
[14:28:15.920 --> 14:28:22.920]  or of over taxation of their people, one of the victims in Europe and also somewhat here in the United States
[14:28:22.920 --> 14:28:28.920]  is the alternative energies, you know, the darlings that were there, the green energies.
[14:28:28.920 --> 14:28:31.920]  And not that I'm necessarily a fan of them.
[14:28:31.920 --> 14:28:33.920]  In some of them, I think they're farcical.
[14:28:33.920 --> 14:28:35.920]  Some of them, you know, they might work or whatever.
[14:28:35.920 --> 14:28:44.920]  But a lot of these alternative energies like wind and solar were counting on big government subsidies.
[14:28:44.920 --> 14:28:48.920]  Hence, we had the big Cylindra story, you know, where they had, I think, half a million dollars
[14:28:48.920 --> 14:28:53.920]  and it's basically evaporated and disappeared here in the United States with the Cylindra story.
[14:28:53.920 --> 14:29:04.920]  And now they're talking about, you know, inditing and investigating the Obama administration's activities and helping Cylindra.
[14:29:04.920 --> 14:29:05.920]  Excuse me.
[14:29:05.920 --> 14:29:15.920]  So we've got a lot of these alternative energies, not that they were necessarily great or fantastic or going to save the world and all that.
[14:29:15.920 --> 14:29:26.920]  But it's interesting to see that it's almost like some level of industrial espionage going on to play with the supply and demand
[14:29:26.920 --> 14:29:29.920]  and the viability of all forms of energy.
[14:29:29.920 --> 14:29:36.920]  I just keep looking at the different things, you know, you've got the wind situation with the windmills and they're, you know,
[14:29:36.920 --> 14:29:41.920]  being attacked from some different angles politically to slow their progress down.
[14:29:41.920 --> 14:29:48.920]  So basically what the NWO has to do, it appears, is that they have to be on the ready with their attack dogs,
[14:29:48.920 --> 14:29:56.920]  whether they be some so-called environmental group of tree huggers that would attack an energy to slow them down and hinder them
[14:29:56.920 --> 14:30:05.920]  or a Deepwater Horizon event or maybe even now that makes me more suspicious that all of a sudden you had these nuclear plants,
[14:30:05.920 --> 14:30:12.920]  you had Fukushima, Calhoun and that plant up in Canada, like almost three in a row, boom, boom, boom.
[14:30:12.920 --> 14:30:19.920]  You know, you really had to start to wonder and the rumors have been out there of exactly what is going on.
[14:30:19.920 --> 14:30:27.920]  In the case of Calhoun plant, they said that that flooding was pretty much intentionally done by the Corps of Engineers
[14:30:27.920 --> 14:30:29.920]  and those reports came out.
[14:30:29.920 --> 14:30:38.920]  So you really have to wonder when it comes to energy and we really have to watch in particular because one way to keep the cost of energy low,
[14:30:38.920 --> 14:30:45.920]  which is really key, one of the key factors to keeping our economy at least at the level it's at, our economy is hurt.
[14:30:45.920 --> 14:30:50.920]  There's no doubt about that, our economy is hurt, it's limping long.
[14:30:50.920 --> 14:30:59.920]  I've driven taxis here in Austin for a long time and we just as a person in the transportation industry,
[14:30:59.920 --> 14:31:07.920]  it's almost like we've got our fingers on the pulse of the economy a lot of times because we rely a lot on travelers coming in and out of the airport,
[14:31:07.920 --> 14:31:10.920]  going in and out of the hotels, convention business and all that.
[14:31:10.920 --> 14:31:20.920]  And just these stories like for instance this past summer with the European economies going potentially in the tank like Greece and Italy and France, etc.
[14:31:20.920 --> 14:31:26.920]  Just those stories hitting the news, stock market news and all that changes the environment of the economy.
[14:31:26.920 --> 14:31:36.920]  So one thing I've learned over the years is if you've got inexpensive energy, if you've got cheap gasoline, inexpensive gasoline,
[14:31:36.920 --> 14:31:44.920]  if you've got inexpensive diesel, then that is one of the biggest factors that dictates how the economy goes.
[14:31:44.920 --> 14:31:51.920]  And to give you an example, actually maybe to give you maybe more than one example, two or three examples,
[14:31:51.920 --> 14:31:55.920]  I grew up basically and first started driving back in the 70s.
[14:31:55.920 --> 14:32:02.920]  And I can actually remember when gasoline was 18 cents a gallon, 20 cents a gallon, 30 cents a gallon in that range.
[14:32:02.920 --> 14:32:08.920]  The first car head was a big Buick with a big gas hog engine, an eight cylinder engine,
[14:32:08.920 --> 14:32:15.920]  burning using about a gallon for every seven miles, a gallon for every eight miles.
[14:32:15.920 --> 14:32:21.920]  And it was no big deal though because you could go get 20 gallons for five or six bucks.
[14:32:21.920 --> 14:32:26.920]  So that was really, we just didn't know how good we had it back then.
[14:32:26.920 --> 14:32:32.920]  Okay, people didn't make the kind of money that they make nowadays, but that's because of inflation.
[14:32:32.920 --> 14:32:39.920]  But still filling up your tank 20 gallons for five or six bucks, picture what that would do for our economy right now.
[14:32:39.920 --> 14:32:44.920]  If somehow there were a big giant rollback, I don't expect it to happen at that level.
[14:32:44.920 --> 14:32:53.920]  But if we could see gasoline down at the buck 25, buck 50 level, that would really be one of the big things to spur the economy.
[14:32:53.920 --> 14:33:01.920]  But back in the 70s, that's one of the first, I guess in my lifetime, the first gas crunch that I can remember.
[14:33:01.920 --> 14:33:06.920]  There might have been other shortages, so-called shortages prior to when I can recall,
[14:33:06.920 --> 14:33:11.920]  but that's the first one I remember really vividly because I was living it in the 70s.
[14:33:11.920 --> 14:33:22.920]  And back then we learned that ultimately gasoline and oil were not going to be the solution to keep us being transported here in the United States.
[14:33:22.920 --> 14:33:26.920]  We learned that back in the 70s. That was a big lesson.
[14:33:26.920 --> 14:33:39.920]  And back in the 70s, we saw gasoline go from, like I said, around 18 cents a gallon, 30 cents a gallon range up to a buck 50 a gallon.
[14:33:39.920 --> 14:33:46.920]  And so taking it from 30 cents to $1.50 was a five-fold increase, five times higher.
[14:33:46.920 --> 14:33:57.920]  So imagine nowadays where we were like in the, I guess about a year ago, we were around the $2.50 range.
[14:33:57.920 --> 14:34:04.920]  Imagine if they had taken it from $2.50, five-fold, five-fold increase.
[14:34:04.920 --> 14:34:07.920]  Imagine what that would have done to our economy.
[14:34:07.920 --> 14:34:10.920]  $12.50, $12.50 a gallon.
[14:34:10.920 --> 14:34:13.920]  Can you imagine the shutdown that would have created?
[14:34:13.920 --> 14:34:19.920]  So that would have been more equivalent to kind of what happened in the 70s because of that five-fold increase.
[14:34:19.920 --> 14:34:23.920]  So it really crunched the economy here in Texas.
[14:34:23.920 --> 14:34:29.920]  I don't know about everywhere, but here in Texas we actually had gas lines at the gasoline stations.
[14:34:29.920 --> 14:34:37.920]  There were, you know, the NWO had, I think, even more control, obviously probably on gasoline and oil back then.
[14:34:37.920 --> 14:34:40.920]  Or maybe they just haven't implemented as much control yet.
[14:34:40.920 --> 14:34:48.920]  They probably have that same level of control if they want to to where we could have, once again, gasoline lines at the stations.
[14:34:48.920 --> 14:34:52.920]  But here in Texas we actually had gasoline lines at the stations.
[14:34:52.920 --> 14:35:04.920]  And at one point there was actually a rationing of a sense because you could only get gasoline on an odd or even day that matched your license plate.
[14:35:04.920 --> 14:35:13.920]  In other words, if your license plate number ended in a one, a three, five, seven, nine, then you could get gasoline on an odd numbered day.
[14:35:13.920 --> 14:35:20.920]  If your license plate was zero, two, four, six, eight, then you could get gas on an even numbered day.
[14:35:20.920 --> 14:35:27.920]  So there was a form of rationing back then in the 70s here in Texas up in the Dallas, Fort Worth area where I grew up.
[14:35:27.920 --> 14:35:35.920]  And fortunately we haven't seen those types of events, at least not on a country wide scale.
[14:35:35.920 --> 14:35:41.920]  I'm not sure even back then, you know, here you most time you just focused more on what's going on locally.
[14:35:41.920 --> 14:35:50.920]  Obviously, and especially as a young man, a teenager at the time, you know, I'm just paying attention kind of more to what's going on locally and not nationwide and certainly not worldwide.
[14:35:50.920 --> 14:36:04.920]  So I don't know how widespread that gas rationing was, but being here in Texas, we had some of the best supply we traditionally for decades and decades has some of the best supply when it comes to oil and gas.
[14:36:04.920 --> 14:36:16.920]  So I can just imagine if we were here in the Fort Worth Dallas area with rationing, then I'm just suspect suspecting that other parts of country had an even more acute rationing back then in the 70s.
[14:36:16.920 --> 14:36:26.920]  So anyway, fast forward though, here we had gasoline diesel prices up over a dollar gallon for years and years and years.
[14:36:26.920 --> 14:36:37.920]  Once we eclipse the dollar figure back in the 70s, you know, we ranged up into $1.25, $1.50, you know, $1.30 range for many, many years.
[14:36:37.920 --> 14:36:44.920]  And frankly, never thought that I would see gasoline back under a dollar a gallon.
[14:36:44.920 --> 14:36:51.920]  But, you know, a little while ago I was talking about how it's such a factor on the economy price of gasoline diesel.
[14:36:51.920 --> 14:36:57.920]  And to demonstrate that is we actually believe it or not, and I couldn't believe it when it happened.
[14:36:57.920 --> 14:37:03.920]  We actually in the late 90s saw gasoline prices go below a dollar a gallon.
[14:37:03.920 --> 14:37:04.920]  I couldn't believe it.
[14:37:04.920 --> 14:37:13.920]  It was literally almost like Christmas every day, especially being an independent contractor and having to buy gasoline every day.
[14:37:13.920 --> 14:37:14.920]  It was amazing.
[14:37:14.920 --> 14:37:17.920]  And think about the economy we had in the late 90s.
[14:37:17.920 --> 14:37:26.920]  That was one of the most popping, humming economies in the late 90s that we may ever see in our lifetime, or at least in my lifetime.
[14:37:26.920 --> 14:37:28.920]  Think of the things that came together.
[14:37:28.920 --> 14:37:33.920]  And a lot of people try to give Bill Clinton credit for the economy of the 90s.
[14:37:33.920 --> 14:37:39.920]  I tell you what, that guy, he's just the lucky guy that he was president at that time when it comes to the economy.
[14:37:39.920 --> 14:37:47.920]  Because think of all the things you had going on starting in the early 90s, mid 90s, building up into the late 90s.
[14:37:47.920 --> 14:37:49.920]  You had the internet coming on.
[14:37:49.920 --> 14:37:56.920]  You had all that build out of the infrastructure of the internet is still that still continues somewhat today.
[14:37:56.920 --> 14:38:01.920]  But back then in the 90s, you know, you had fiber optic cable being laid everywhere.
[14:38:01.920 --> 14:38:07.920]  You had, you know, roads being dug up for fiber optic cable, all the infrastructure for the internet.
[14:38:07.920 --> 14:38:15.920]  You had cell phones just blowing up my first cell phone I had in 1997.
[14:38:15.920 --> 14:38:22.920]  And now kids grow up and they get their cell phone, you know, when they're kids and they can't imagine a world without cell phones.
[14:38:22.920 --> 14:38:25.920]  And now it's hard to imagine a world without cell phones.
[14:38:25.920 --> 14:38:33.920]  But think of the infrastructure that had to go into the behind the scenes of making the cell phone industry work.
[14:38:33.920 --> 14:38:43.920]  The towers, all the different wires and and as that Alaskan senator that got fired, thankfully used to say to talk about the internet and the tubes.
[14:38:43.920 --> 14:38:58.920]  But all that infrastructure built out in, you know, starting in the late 80s, going in the early 90s cell phones, people getting handsets, internet, people getting PCs and computers.
[14:38:58.920 --> 14:39:02.920]  I didn't even mess with the computer till around 1997.
[14:39:02.920 --> 14:39:06.920]  You know, I'm still pretty bad on the keyboard even after 14 years.
[14:39:06.920 --> 14:39:16.920]  But here I was in 1997 would have been approximately, you know, late 30s, early 40s and had never really messed with computers.
[14:39:16.920 --> 14:39:28.920]  And here in 1997, I'm taking some of my first trips to the library in Dallas, Texas to get on a computer there for free and working on that slow internet from the that we had back in the late 90s.
[14:39:28.920 --> 14:39:32.920]  So it's just amazing what happened in the late 90s.
[14:39:32.920 --> 14:39:35.920]  Like I said, you had the hardware of the PCs blowing up.
[14:39:35.920 --> 14:39:47.920]  You had the internet coming on board and being built out and not just here in the United States, but obviously worldwide, which all that also drove the stock market bubble of the time.
[14:39:47.920 --> 14:40:04.920]  And then on top of that, you've got so you've got stock market blowing up and people washing cash. You had what they call delionaires here in in Texas because a lot of them had stock options at Dell and had become millionaires almost overnight.
[14:40:04.920 --> 14:40:23.920]  You know, it took a few years or whatever, but you had the gasoline go down below a dollar gallon and that's where just it really ramped up to just a hot white economic Zenith back in 1999 2000.
[14:40:23.920 --> 14:40:36.920]  And during that time, I knew that times were pretty good. I just didn't realize how good they they were and then how bad it would be to come. Although I'd been listening to Alex like I said, since 97 and I was definitely concerned.
[14:40:36.920 --> 14:40:42.920]  But and I can't say that we've seen the worst of the economy yet.
[14:40:42.920 --> 14:40:55.920]  That's for sure. But it's going to be this audience is going to make a difference in trying to stop them because whenever we see activities, whenever we see what's going on, it's like I was talking about the Cushing story in Oklahoma earlier.
[14:40:55.920 --> 14:41:10.920]  Those reports helped come out. I think those reports that came out with the oversupply and the overhead supply of oil are what helped push back that agenda of trying to get gasoline up to $6 and $7 a gallon.
[14:41:10.920 --> 14:41:18.920]  I really believe that. And so it's info warriors out there in this audience that bring these stories to the forefront that get them reported.
[14:41:18.920 --> 14:41:26.920]  And then Alex can sit here with this powerful microphone and his powerful voice and get these stories out. And that's how they make a difference.
[14:41:26.920 --> 14:41:40.920]  I mean, when the drudge report puts his links on to info wars and all the other stories that drudge report dot com comes out with. It really does make an impact, I believe.
[14:41:40.920 --> 14:41:46.920]  And would we ever potentially see another economy like we had in the late 90s?
[14:41:46.920 --> 14:41:58.920]  I don't know. I mean, think of the convergence of all these different build outs that occurred cell phones, hardware for computers, PCs, the Internet itself and the build out that occurred there.
[14:41:58.920 --> 14:42:09.920]  And then all these companies figuring out ways to take advantage of the Internet, a brand new industry, a huge what is now is huge industry and is still in development.
[14:42:09.920 --> 14:42:18.920]  Actually, we're still really in the early stages. Here it is 2011 and the Internet really has only really kind of come on board since the late 90s.
[14:42:18.920 --> 14:42:30.920]  So it's all is still very young overall. Think of the automobile back when it was invented and think looking back now how we've had the automobile for, you know, 100 plus years or however long.
[14:42:30.920 --> 14:42:43.920]  And at that time, let's say only 15 or 20 years into the age of the automobile. Looking back now, those automobiles were just antique by today's standards.
[14:42:43.920 --> 14:42:51.920]  And back then they were state of the art. So here we are with the development of the Internet. Who knows where it's all going to go.
[14:42:51.920 --> 14:43:05.920]  But hopefully we'll still maintain the level of freedom on the Internet. And if it can, if there's some way to increase that level of freedom and First Amendment freedom on the web, hopefully it will.
[14:43:05.920 --> 14:43:11.920]  But that economy of the late 90s was really something to behold.
[14:43:11.920 --> 14:43:23.920]  And part of what really made it home, along with those buildouts of cell phones, PCs, Internet, etc. And the cheap gasoline on top of it all was just amazing.
[14:43:23.920 --> 14:43:31.920]  And then you had a stock market where you had millionaires that were made over a period of three or four or five years and they're out there spending their money.
[14:43:31.920 --> 14:43:42.920]  So that's why I say that. And of course, pretty much everybody knows here in the United States, the inexpensive gasoline is a big key to our economy.
[14:43:42.920 --> 14:43:56.920]  And I think one way that we can get some of that back and get our economy back is to fight for and expose just how much oil is out there.
[14:43:56.920 --> 14:44:13.920]  I personally, like I said, I'm not a big fan of oil. That's the monopoly. Ultimately, we need to get away from. But we are not going to be able to unless we keep exposing the oil and also keep the American ingenuity up.
[14:44:13.920 --> 14:44:32.920]  The only good thing that is derived from these high prices of gasoline oil is that it does make American ingenuity kick back into gear with the alternatives. But one thing the NWO appears to do is they appear to ratchet up gasoline prices up into the higher
[14:44:32.920 --> 14:44:50.920]  ranges that we've never seen like the $4 gallon range, etc. But then, you know, alternative starts to come online and it squashes them. So I don't know what the ultimate answer is there to keep our gasoline oil prices inexpensive and to keep our more importantly to keep
[14:44:50.920 --> 14:45:04.920]  transportation prices inexpensive. That is a big key to our economy. So who knows what the final solutions are going to be to that. But you know what? I have faith in the fellow Americans here on Info Wars.
[14:45:04.920 --> 14:45:23.920]  And in general, that we will come up with solutions to keep transportation inexpensive. And that is a major, major factor to thwart the NWO is creating our own economies, doing stuff like young Jevity, the info wars team.com.
[14:45:23.920 --> 14:45:41.920]  I think more and more people are going to get on board with those types of companies like Info Wars team and the young Jevity products, because we've got to have many times more than one gig, so to speak, more than one job, more than one business.
[14:45:41.920 --> 14:45:58.920]  Because the multitasking effect, the same as what we do on the Internet, seems to be kind of the way of the future. And I think that opportunities like Info Wars team are going to be critical to keeping Americans working and to keeping Americans prosperous.
[14:45:58.920 --> 14:46:18.920]  We have an opportunity to really go international with this business. I was researching that more here recently, and I didn't realize that they're already in a lot of countries. They're already in 50, 60 countries. So if you've got friends and family over there, that's a good opportunity to get a worldwide business going.
[14:46:18.920 --> 14:46:29.920]  And so I think that, and that's just one example of the ingenuity that Americans have had in the past and will continue to have. So I've got a lot of faith in my fellow Americans.
[14:46:29.920 --> 14:46:40.920]  Okay, wow, I've already talked 47 minutes. That's hard to believe that I've already talked 47. I printed out all this news to cover, and obviously I'm not going to cover much of it.
[14:46:40.920 --> 14:46:56.920]  Okay, what? Let's open up. No, let's not open up the phones. I'm going to try to cover a little bit more news. And during the last five minutes, want to talk a little bit about the upcoming Ron Paul campaign and how exciting that's going to be for 2012.
[14:46:56.920 --> 14:47:10.920]  So stay tuned for that. But in the meantime, speaking of the economy, you know, I guess most of y'all keeping up with the news here on info wars.com. And I know a lot of y'all coast to coast fans and drudge report fans, etc.
[14:47:10.920 --> 14:47:26.920]  Are fully aware that they've got the G 20 going on in cans France can France and Obama's over there and a lot of world leaders are there. And we've had this European economic debacle going on now for months.
[14:47:26.920 --> 14:47:42.920]  And one of the things that we've all been expecting and we've all been expecting and I think we'll certainly at some point come to fruition will be that they're going to pump a lot of liquidity into that European economy.
[14:47:42.920 --> 14:47:58.920]  And I think ultimately they'll be pumping a lot more liquidity into the US economy, but they've slowed down on that to some degree, I think because of the protests of info warriors and people like ourselves worried about them over inflating the economy.
[14:47:58.920 --> 14:48:15.920]  But I think it's still probably going to happen because the NWO literally has to walk a tightrope. I think when it comes to just how bad the economy can be allowed to get. And in Europe, if they really pull in their horns and have that austerity,
[14:48:15.920 --> 14:48:35.920]  remember I was talking about how in Europe earlier, a lot of these alternative energy companies are subsidized to a great degree. And it sounds pretty bad that a lot of them are subsidized. But I guess the flip side is, is that, you know, besides there are probably a lot of top level people in some of these subsidized alternative
[14:48:35.920 --> 14:48:53.920]  energy companies that are stealing the money, kind of like when we send billions of dollars to other countries around the world. A lot of times that crooked leadership runs off with a good, good sized chunk. Sometimes maybe even a majority, maybe even 98, 90, 80 or 90% of the millions or
[14:48:53.920 --> 14:49:10.920]  billions that we give to other countries. And I think a lot of that sometimes does happen with these government subsidies to these alternative energy companies and other companies. But nonetheless, at least a little bit does find its way into the hands of the regular
[14:49:10.920 --> 14:49:30.920]  working Joe. So when they pull the plug on these things, it's going to cut back on some of these jobs, and it's going to cut back on these upcoming alternative energies. And it's like I said, not necessarily that I'm a big fan of it. It's just that the level of
[14:49:30.920 --> 14:49:50.920]  industrial espionage with regards to the energy prices is what I'm talking about and concerned about. So anyway, they're having the G 20 and cans France, and they're discussing boosting that liquidity through the IMF, which ultimately, I think the IMF and you folks out there in the audience will probably
[14:49:50.920 --> 14:50:07.920]  have the Federal Reserve and the IMF. There's probably not a whole lot of difference there linked at the hip. They're like Simon's twins. So look for that to happen because I think that the NWO has to be concerned that if they allow their economy to really go down the
[14:50:07.920 --> 14:50:23.920]  tube and really go down the skids that more and more people wake up. That's the danger is yeah, they put a lot of people out on the street. They put people out there homeless. They put them out there destitute there on the European version of food stamps, etc.
[14:50:23.920 --> 14:50:42.920]  But more and more people wake up to who the gangster banksters and the geopolitical leaders and movers and shakers really are. So they've got to walk an economic tightrope there. And that's why I think that they will ultimately flood Europe with liquidity.
[14:50:42.920 --> 14:50:59.920]  And they're going to figure out ways to pump it out there, even if they have to subsidize basically any kind of upstart company, any kind of mom and pop company, they'll probably end up doing it, which ultimately will end up most likely being highly inflationary.
[14:50:59.920 --> 14:51:21.920]  But at least, you know, it's kind of like they inject a little bit of morphine to make the patient feel better temporarily at least. And then they have to inject more morphine with this liquidity. So it looks like after months and months of wrangling and haranguing that it may finally happen over there in Europe and the United States will definitely be involved in helping make that happen.
[14:51:21.920 --> 14:51:33.920]  And I think the European leaders are appealing to the US and basically Obama has responded that they're on their own. But, you know, they're really not the Bernanke's are going to be involved.
[14:51:33.920 --> 14:51:55.920]  And so it's going to be interesting to see how they handle this European debacle. And I've got mixed feelings about that because one thing I've noticed is that, hey, what, you know, if Europe experiences a depression, and in some cases it is a depression like Greece, I'm sure most of that country, a lot of that country is at a depression level.
[14:51:55.920 --> 14:52:09.920]  Then I think they will further take our economy down into depression. So that's where we've got to be prepared. Got to do the best we can to get ourselves out of debt to get ourselves as self sufficient as possible.
[14:52:09.920 --> 14:52:26.920]  And even, like I say, if you've got a job with a big corporate entity, I would definitely be looking for other ways to supplement my income and info wars team.com is a great place to do it. And also, I think it's key to support the show.
[14:52:26.920 --> 14:52:43.920]  So I haven't mentioned it yet, but info wars money bomb.com. This is part of the info wars money bomb.com that we're doing today. A full 27 hours. We've got Alex will be coming on later in the broadcast today at in about six minutes.
[14:52:43.920 --> 14:52:57.920]  We've got Charlotte, Israel be coming on with an interview and then eight o'clock live via Skype will be Gerald Salente. So keep on listening info warriors and I want to continue thanking this audience.
[14:52:57.920 --> 14:53:10.920]  And I tell you, Alex Jones is a powerful individual. He's done a lot by himself. He proves every day that one man can make a difference. Let me say that again. He proves it on a daily basis that one man can make a difference.
[14:53:10.920 --> 14:53:25.920]  But I tell you, without this audience, even Alex Jones is powerful of an individual as he is without you out there in the audience. He wouldn't be near as powerful as what he's become today.
[14:53:25.920 --> 14:53:43.920]  And it's very exciting to see his operation continue to grow. He gives back to the community by hiring fellow patriots and and other people and bringing them on board. And he really is now looking to this upcoming year go out on the road and meet
[14:53:43.920 --> 14:53:55.920]  more info warriors and visit more areas of the country and talk to more people out there. All right, we've got five minutes to go. Didn't cover hardly any of the news that I thought I'd cover. No surprise there.
[14:53:55.920 --> 14:54:02.920]  I guess it happens to me all the time. Even when I was doing access cable TV, that's what would happen. I would be ready with all this news and couldn't cover it. But
[14:54:02.920 --> 14:54:19.920]  All right, that red tide still kicking me in the chest. But one of the most important things we can do, along with supporting info wars money bomb dot com along with supporting info wars dot com.
[14:54:19.920 --> 14:54:34.920]  And along with supporting Ron Paul on his website Ron Paul 2012 is we've got to get ourselves to the precinct conventions and precinct caucuses in these upcoming primaries folks.
[14:54:34.920 --> 14:54:37.920]  It's going to be critical.
[14:54:37.920 --> 14:54:49.920]  We need to get out in front of this right now you need to get your yard signs out, your bumper stickers out, do what's called drive by canvassing do that right now learn where your precinct is.
[14:54:49.920 --> 14:54:59.920]  Learn your get your map go to your county, call up whoever you need to to find out where your precinct boundaries are where they lie and get a map of your precinct.
[14:54:59.920 --> 14:55:11.920]  And now is the time to get those bumper stickers yard signs out. Go out and find your neighbors your fellow neighbors out there with bumper stickers and yard signs for Ron Paul or like minded candidates.
[14:55:11.920 --> 14:55:21.920]  There's other candidates I'm sure in your areas that are along the lines of Ron Paul and info warriors go out there and find your neighbors in your precinct.
[14:55:21.920 --> 14:55:44.920]  Those are going to be the first ones you want to find and you guys get together and call a huddle and make out a plan to attack and take over the rest of your precinct and by that I mean politically speaking of course is go out and get lists of primary voters on both sides of the
[14:55:44.920 --> 14:56:01.920]  aisle left and right Democrat and Republican get those lists. You can focus on if you've had races in the past with a Ron Paul type candidate in your area, then it makes it even easier to try to locate your friends out there in your precinct.
[14:56:01.920 --> 14:56:14.920]  Because for example here in Texas we had Deborah Medina run for governor back in 2010 and during the primary in my precinct. I think she ended up getting 30 or 40 some odd votes in my precinct.
[14:56:14.920 --> 14:56:29.920]  So I could look at the list of primary voters from the 2010 election which in my precinct only encompassed about 80 votes in the Republican primary of which Deborah Medina had like 30 or 40 votes.
[14:56:29.920 --> 14:56:50.920]  So there's only 80 doors, actually less than 80 doors that I need to knock on in my precinct to find my 30 or 40 Deborah Medina voters because a lot of these households, it might be husband and wife or son and daughter or whatever that are voting age that have voted from that one household.
[14:56:50.920 --> 14:57:04.920]  Use those strategies to find your fellow info warriors to find your fellow Ron Paul revolutionaries etc. and the time to find those folks in your precincts is right now.
[14:57:04.920 --> 14:57:19.920]  This is dead serious right now. Our best opportunity to make Ron Paul the Republican presidential nominee for 2012. Our best opportunity is going to be via the convention process because you can fully expect
[14:57:19.920 --> 14:57:28.920]  the NWO is going to swing those levers and hit those switches and punch those buttons to black box us at every turn.
[14:57:28.920 --> 14:57:38.920]  You see them black box us so to speak in these so called scientific polls. Alex proved back in 2007 in the fall of 2007.
[14:57:38.920 --> 14:57:55.920]  I'm surprised he never talks about it but Alex actually commissioned a poll back in the fall of 2007 to show that Ron Paul was one of the leaders if not the leader and even the poll he commissioned tried to skew the poll that Alex had commissioned.
[14:57:55.920 --> 14:58:12.920]  It was amazing and maybe he'll talk about that in the upcoming future programs but even in the major so called mainstream polls watch for the shenanigans there. Alex proved that it goes on in the polls so don't trust the polls.
[14:58:12.920 --> 14:58:27.920]  Don't trust these pollsters. Don't trust anything. Take action. Get out in your precincts and motivate and connect with your fellow info warriors. Think about this. Think of it if a total economic depression calamity happened.
[14:58:27.920 --> 14:58:38.920]  How important it would be to know your like minded neighbors. Just for that reason alone is why you should connect to your neighbors. So get out there getting your precincts.
[14:58:38.920 --> 14:58:52.920]  Get to know your fellow info warriors and then when it comes time for your precinct convention your precinct caucus this upcoming 2012 elections absolutely imperative that you show up with every Ron Paul supporter and info warrior.
[14:58:52.920 --> 14:59:15.920]  You can muster to these events because if we end up being a majority in the precinct conventions and that's the that's politics at the atomic level. If you have an atom that is if you have like 10 atoms and 80% are Ron Paul atoms and 2% are Rhino atoms in each precinct convention on average.
[14:59:15.920 --> 14:59:26.920]  Then guess what when it comes to the Republican National Convention we will be a majority and that's how Ron Paul gets to be the Republican nominee. Okay, I'm already a little bit over folks.
[14:59:26.920 --> 14:59:30.920]  We've got a great interview with Charlotte is becoming up so stay tuned.
[14:59:30.920 --> 14:59:49.920]  This next hour Charlotte is really then Gerald Salente coming up live via Skype right after Charlotte is really and then Alex Jones will be back later today to wrap up with the 27 hour money bomb info wars money bomb dot com folks get out there email to your friends call your friends.
[14:59:49.920 --> 15:00:07.920]  Let them know and make this money bomb a success info wars money bomb dot com Richard Reeves signing off for now. Thank you very much.
[15:00:07.920 --> 15:00:27.920]  They paid Wall Street financed Hitler financed Stalin creating communism which is what they did. That's all very bad and skull and bones is all involved in that with the order.
[15:00:27.920 --> 15:00:52.920]  They concerned the build up of the three types of socialism Bolshevik socialism in Russia. What we might call welfare socialism in the United States and Hitler and on national socialism and each book examines the financing and the contributions made by Wall Street by international bankers to that to the development of that specific form of socialism.
[15:00:52.920 --> 15:01:12.920]  It also was involved in changing the American education system from a classical academic brain oriented thinking destroying that and imposing animal training method which skull and bones would deeply involved and I think I would just say the only entity at that time deeply involved
[15:01:12.920 --> 15:01:31.920]  and managed to bring that wretched system of opera conditioning Pavlov skin or whatever you want to call it animal training out of the laboratory in life's sake Germany will have one and get it adopted by leading American educators.
[15:01:31.920 --> 15:01:57.920]  Motivation and reward are crucial factors in learning a motivated animal will learn any response which occurs and is promptly followed by a reduction in the strength of the drive.
[15:01:57.920 --> 15:02:13.920]  My father and grandfather were members of the order skull and bones was put together by William Russell in 1830 secret society university and the connections with Germany are pretty extensive.
[15:02:13.920 --> 15:02:34.920]  The Illuminati I think there's a lot of research out there that I haven't even read that is there that does connect with the Illuminati and the Illuminati of course is Bavarian Marxist society based on destroying the family destroying the church which at that time was Catholic Catholicism
[15:02:34.920 --> 15:02:55.920]  destroying religion destroying national entities boundaries no more I have you know the proofs of conspiracy by Robeson the original copy of that and it says right in there you know where the order it's interesting the order right.
[15:02:55.920 --> 15:03:13.920]  The goal was to adjust as I said down with the family down with the royalty at that time governments were royalty and they were religious that was Western European right down with.
[15:03:13.920 --> 15:03:26.920]  Nationalism get rid of countries drop borders drop borders I mean and people think that that's new.
[15:03:26.920 --> 15:03:43.920]  The Illuminati order documents show that Rafael and the Illuminati is identified as the same professor Carl Casimir want. This is fascinating.
[15:03:43.920 --> 15:04:01.920]  What I was talking about was professor at Heidelberg University in the history and geography of Baden this town and pastor of the church at a small neighborhood town so one was connected with the Illuminati his grandfather.
[15:04:01.920 --> 15:04:22.920]  This is the background of Wilhelm Maximilian want who really trained the American educators in the behavioral psychology stimulus response training type of skin or opera conditioning bells whistles all that stuff which does not teach it trains.
[15:04:22.920 --> 15:04:40.920]  For the work force now this was the order at Yale was directly connected with Wilhelm want they sent educators over there to study under want Stanley Hall was the first one to go.
[15:04:40.920 --> 15:04:55.920]  This is so important this stuff here. Hmm. The Hagellian influence on Hall between 1870 and 1882 a span of 12 months Hall of the American.
[15:04:55.920 --> 15:04:58.920]  There's a lot of information on him here too but I won't go into it.
[15:04:58.920 --> 15:05:07.920]  He was connected with skull and bones priority going over it probably sent him over spent six years in Germany.
[15:05:07.920 --> 15:05:23.920]  And he says I do not know of any of this is Hall talking any other American student of these subjects philosophy and psychology who came into even the slight personal contact it was my fortune to enjoy with Hartman and Fettner.
[15:05:23.920 --> 15:05:35.920]  There were psychologists over there as well nor of any psychologist who had the experience of attempting experimental work with Helmholtz and I think I was the first American pupil of want.
[15:05:35.920 --> 15:05:42.920]  Now want is the one we're dealing with Wilhelm want from Germany.
[15:05:42.920 --> 15:05:51.920]  He had the first laboratory and people think that American psychology and all was.
[15:05:51.920 --> 15:06:00.920]  The psychologist studied under Pavlov Pavlov was the first no Pavlov interesting enough studied under Wilhelm want.
[15:06:00.920 --> 15:06:12.920]  In Leipzig the 12 years included in the span as an American pupil of want more than any other equal period marked and gave direction to modern psychology.
[15:06:12.920 --> 15:06:14.920]  Wilhelm want.
[15:06:14.920 --> 15:06:24.920]  1832 to 1920 professor of philosophy at University of Leipzig was undoubtedly the major influence on G Stanley Hall.
[15:06:24.920 --> 15:06:30.920]  Who was subsequently you trained you know all the others Thorndike Dewey and all of them okay.
[15:06:30.920 --> 15:06:41.920]  And he was sent over Hall the it appears that he had a lot of connections with the order at Yale and that's why he ultimately ended up going to Leipzig.
[15:06:41.920 --> 15:06:58.920]  Modern education state practice stems from Hegelian social theory combined with the experimental psychology of Wilhelm want the Hegelian theory you know create the problem people scream impose a solution type of thing and I'll write no wrong to.
[15:06:58.920 --> 15:07:18.920]  Whereas Karl Marx and von Bismarck applied Hegelian theory to the political field it was Wilhelm want influenced by Johann Herbert who applied Hegel the Hegelian dialectic to education which in turn was picked up by Hall and John Dewey.
[15:07:18.920 --> 15:07:33.920]  And modern educational theorists in the United States that that's the create the problem and people scream impose a solution that's the hey that's the Hegel want is the animal training method that bypasses the brain.
[15:07:33.920 --> 15:07:48.920]  What is important in the history of American education for the following reasons he established in 1875 the world's first laboratory in experimental psychology to measure individual responses to stimuli to.
[15:07:48.920 --> 15:08:05.920]  Wouldn't believe that man is only the summation of his experience of the stimuli that bear upon him. It follows from this that for one man has no self will no self determination man is an effect only the captive of his experiences a pawn.
[15:08:05.920 --> 15:08:27.920]  Needing guidance three students from Europe and the United States came to life's sake to learn from one the new science of experimental psychology these students returned to their homelands to found schools of education or departments of psychology and trained hundreds of PhDs in the new field of psychology.
[15:08:27.920 --> 15:08:40.920]  The core of our problem is that once work was based on Hegelian philosophical theory and reflected the Hegelian view of the individual as a valueless cog in the state.
[15:08:40.920 --> 15:08:49.920]  A view expanded by want to include man as nothing more than an animal influenced solely by daily experiment experiences.
[15:08:49.920 --> 15:09:04.920]  This windy and view of the world was brought back from life's sake to the United States by G Stanley Hall and other Americans and went through what is known among psychologists as the Americanization of want.
[15:09:04.920 --> 15:09:15.920]  Although Hall was primarily psychologist and teacher his political views were partially Marxist as Hall himself writes quote.
[15:09:15.920 --> 15:09:21.920]  I had wrestled with Karl Marx and half accepted what I understood of him.
[15:09:21.920 --> 15:09:28.920]  Confessions and don't forget Karl Marx used the communist manifest it was basically wise house.
[15:09:28.920 --> 15:09:30.920]  It's important to remember that.
[15:09:30.920 --> 15:09:43.920]  So this is really a very this is a very fine chapter out of Sutton's book America's Secret Establishment how this is a chapter how the order controls education.
[15:09:43.920 --> 15:09:57.920]  And I want to point out that nobody but Sutton in the writings on the order has ever really dealt with education.
[15:09:57.920 --> 15:09:59.920]  Sutton saw the importance.
[15:09:59.920 --> 15:10:07.920]  I mean he had been doing all the work on our you know aid to the Soviet Union on technology and all for the Hoover Institute.
[15:10:07.920 --> 15:10:14.920]  But he really he's the only one who ever connected the order with education.
[15:10:14.920 --> 15:10:22.920]  Yeah you know even this great book that we've all that suddenly likes the connection this great book.
[15:10:22.920 --> 15:10:28.920]  I don't believe that Paoli Leoni understood the connection with the order either.
[15:10:28.920 --> 15:10:37.920]  He wrote about what's fantastic little book you couldn't get it the viewers can get this book.
[15:10:37.920 --> 15:10:42.920]  I think it's you know there are a few very important books on education.
[15:10:42.920 --> 15:10:50.920]  I'd say that this is the number one book on education that's ever been written this little book.
[15:10:50.920 --> 15:11:02.920]  And I think Anthony Sutton agreed because he got a lot of his work in his book on the order from the likes of connection as well.
[15:11:02.920 --> 15:11:16.920]  If we want to start with the condition of the average American right now who has been conditioned by the television and in the schools
[15:11:16.920 --> 15:11:23.920]  and pretty much in daily life you know with the community councils and all it goes away from the individual.
[15:11:23.920 --> 15:11:28.920]  Everything is to get well John Dewey said it we have to get rid of the individualism.
[15:11:28.920 --> 15:11:39.920]  Everything goes towards the collective the group and forever since the early 60s or 50s they've had the training sessions going on.
[15:11:39.920 --> 15:11:48.920]  We started in Bethel main national training labs to use sensitivity training to bring people together in groups and they all spill their guts about everything.
[15:11:48.920 --> 15:11:53.920]  And once you've done that you're dependent on that person right because they know everything about you.
[15:11:53.920 --> 15:11:55.920]  So this is the way you form the collective.
[15:11:55.920 --> 15:12:03.920]  It really is very interesting the sensitivity training how it works and it says right in the original documents that it's Chinese communist thought control.
[15:12:03.920 --> 15:12:08.920]  Well Americans have been exposed to this now you know since certainly since World War II.
[15:12:08.920 --> 15:12:12.920]  And they've become little collectivists really groupies they think that way.
[15:12:12.920 --> 15:12:24.920]  Anybody who thinks as an individual really is looked at a scant you know strange person you know having an opinion that is opposite to what I've heard every night on the TV or in school or in college.
[15:12:24.920 --> 15:12:27.920]  Strange person these individuals huh.
[15:12:27.920 --> 15:12:36.920]  So that's what we're looking at now we finally this is very interesting right now I mean talking about the Rockefeller Foundation
[15:12:36.920 --> 15:12:40.920]  the General Education Board of Carnegie.
[15:12:40.920 --> 15:12:51.920]  You have this is the chart showing that the University of Chicago the School of Education which had John Dewey and Charles Judd were there.
[15:12:51.920 --> 15:13:00.920]  Columbia University Teachers College John Dewey Thorndike who had his pet chickens that he trained James E Russell.
[15:13:00.920 --> 15:13:10.920]  And then James McKell at the Department of Psychology at Columbia all those those were all funded.
[15:13:10.920 --> 15:13:18.920]  And Hopkins Medical School by Rockefeller Foundation's General Education Board and.
[15:13:18.920 --> 15:13:20.920]  Carnegie Foundation.
[15:13:20.920 --> 15:13:27.920]  Now when you think back to everything I've been talking about the Carnegie conclusions and recommendations to change.
[15:13:27.920 --> 15:13:37.920]  The American 1934 to change American education from the standard you know classical education that we have basically to outcomes based dad because Carnegie.
[15:13:37.920 --> 15:13:45.920]  After they wrote that nifty little blue book that outlines a socialist America using Carnegie's views.
[15:13:45.920 --> 15:13:49.920]  They they had something called the eight year study.
[15:13:49.920 --> 15:13:59.920]  The Carnegie Corporation which we didn't realize until I read something in an education the Education Commission of States used to have our still does maybe.
[15:13:59.920 --> 15:14:07.920]  In Denver has a newsletter and I was reading it one day and at the bottom of the page I just saw something and it said.
[15:14:07.920 --> 15:14:18.920]  OBE is simply the because we're fighting OBE outcomes based education performance based education for workforce training performance performance.
[15:14:18.920 --> 15:14:29.920]  And I turned the page and I said it's just a rerun virtually of the Carnegie Corporation's eight year study.
[15:14:29.920 --> 15:14:34.920]  In the 1930s I went what.
[15:14:34.920 --> 15:14:41.920]  And then we went and we got the whole eight year study out of the University of Georgia library because the editor of my book.
[15:14:41.920 --> 15:14:49.920]  It lives in Athens Georgia and we got the eight year study and the eight year study actually is what they're putting in right now it's the no grades.
[15:14:49.920 --> 15:15:01.920]  It's removing the Carnegie unit which requires the old Carnegie unit you guys went through it in school you know we all did for four years of math for science for English for history whatever.
[15:15:01.920 --> 15:15:03.920]  In order to graduate.
[15:15:03.920 --> 15:15:12.920]  And all of that has been removed now because the student is is not being is not focusing on intellectual endeavor.
[15:15:12.920 --> 15:15:20.920]  It's workforce training and so they're taking those years away and they're taking ABCD grades away.
[15:15:20.920 --> 15:15:29.920]  They're taking kindergarten one two three through twelve away and the whole thing is an open system where the child proceeds at his own pace.
[15:15:29.920 --> 15:15:41.920]  And has his own test he's not being compared against anybody else no competition because he is the cog in the wheel he's being trained for the state and the corporations.
[15:15:41.920 --> 15:15:51.920]  Not for his own upward mobility forget classical education that's what they're putting in right now they're calling it reinventing schools coalition.
[15:15:51.920 --> 15:16:01.920]  And interestingly enough why I should be living in this tall small town of Dresden main where it's one of the pilots one of the few in the country for it.
[15:16:01.920 --> 15:16:09.920]  I went over and I found out about it their whole goal was to turn education on its head into training.
[15:16:09.920 --> 15:16:15.920]  Which is exactly what they want to do because if you take the Carnegie's little.
[15:16:15.920 --> 15:16:21.920]  Conclusions and recommendations for the social studies forget social studies OK I don't know why they call it that really.
[15:16:21.920 --> 15:16:28.920]  It was really conclusions and recommendations for the destruction of American education that little book by putting.
[15:16:28.920 --> 15:16:33.920]  That new system in.
[15:16:33.920 --> 15:16:41.920]  And the very people who signed off on their report were involved in in all of this Columbia.
[15:16:41.920 --> 15:16:48.920]  George Counts Rod Balu you know all the names and and so Carnegie.
[15:16:48.920 --> 15:16:59.920]  Whereas you had Hopkins and University of Chicago and all we're putting in the method Carnegie was advocating the change of our.
[15:16:59.920 --> 15:17:05.920]  Formerly free market system to a planned economy.
[15:17:05.920 --> 15:17:13.920]  Soviet style through the schools that's a little blood little dark blue book conclusions and recommendations.
[15:17:13.920 --> 15:17:18.920]  That is recommending a new form of government and economic system for the United States.
[15:17:18.920 --> 15:17:25.920]  And it clearly states in there the American people are going to have to get used to this because this is the new order.
[15:17:25.920 --> 15:17:28.920]  This is these barriers are breaking down all over the world.
[15:17:28.920 --> 15:17:34.920]  We've got to have a world system and all you know this is all I mean this isn't direct quotes but this is what the book tells you.
[15:17:34.920 --> 15:17:39.920]  And that the curriculum has to be completely revised.
[15:17:39.920 --> 15:17:50.920]  From the old classical curriculum to focus on world government basically that's that little 1934 book.
[15:17:50.920 --> 15:17:54.920]  So at the same time you had.
[15:17:54.920 --> 15:18:01.920]  Columbia University and and do we in all of them do we had you know a lot of them have been to the Soviet Union.
[15:18:01.920 --> 15:18:09.920]  George counts and they were just saying this is the most wonderful system is a blah blah blah well you know.
[15:18:09.920 --> 15:18:12.920]  I think counts.
[15:18:12.920 --> 15:18:19.920]  Recounted or recanted sort of at the end you know I think you realize because things were getting pretty brutal in the 30s.
[15:18:19.920 --> 15:18:23.920]  Under Stalin it was pretty hard to defend the system.
[15:18:23.920 --> 15:18:33.920]  But anyway the goal I think people will always ask well why on earth did Wall Street finance the Bolshevik Revolution.
[15:18:33.920 --> 15:18:41.920]  Why would they do that well I think they did it because.
[15:18:41.920 --> 15:18:47.920]  Russia was a very I don't think they did it because they were.
[15:18:47.920 --> 15:18:53.920]  Atheists or one thing or the other I mean William Boyce Thompson he was.
[15:18:53.920 --> 15:19:01.920]  Head of the first head of the Federal Reserve I think he he put a hundred thousand of his own money into Russia.
[15:19:01.920 --> 15:19:04.920]  I think it was all greed.
[15:19:04.920 --> 15:19:15.920]  Personally I think that's why these initially started supporting the Bolshevik Revolution I think they wanted to be in control of the natural resources.
[15:19:15.920 --> 15:19:22.920]  Talking about America's secret establishment by Anthony Sutton I knew Anthony Sutton we met.
[15:19:22.920 --> 15:19:29.920]  We both were working on US Soviet Soviet policy I used to be in the State Department so I was interested in that too.
[15:19:29.920 --> 15:19:37.920]  But one day you know he said you know I'm interested in the influence of the order at Yale and I said oh you are.
[15:19:37.920 --> 15:19:46.920]  And interesting enough I had just the day before received the copies of the membership in three or four little.
[15:19:46.920 --> 15:19:51.920]  Little books there actually we can take pictures of them if you want I have them.
[15:19:51.920 --> 15:19:59.920]  And he said you have the membership list I said yes and he asked me to send it to him and I did he promised to get them back which he did.
[15:19:59.920 --> 15:20:10.920]  And he told me he said Charlotte I've been doing research for the Hoover Institute for several years on USA to the Soviet Union.
[15:20:10.920 --> 15:20:15.920]  And wondering what on earth are we doing why are we building up our enemy.
[15:20:15.920 --> 15:20:26.920]  I just couldn't understand it and he said when I put all those names on the membership list that you had out on the dining room table all of a sudden everything made sense.
[15:20:26.920 --> 15:20:34.920]  I saw the names of these very important people who were all involved in the defense contracts who were involved in education going way back.
[15:20:34.920 --> 15:20:46.920]  Everything I saw what they were doing and that was when he became you know even he really he really started focusing and he wrote the book after he got the list.
[15:20:46.920 --> 15:20:57.920]  And I've always really liked that this is a really good quote here that I like to use because not just because the fellow that he's quoting was a friend of my father's.
[15:20:57.920 --> 15:21:07.920]  Sort of interesting but because it's so it tells you exactly how important the order of skull and bones at Yale is.
[15:21:07.920 --> 15:21:16.920]  People say oh it's a little boys club and they ignore it they ignore the fact that John Kerry and George Bush were both running for president.
[15:21:16.920 --> 15:21:28.920]  You know they didn't I mean this is sort of weird that out of an organization that has a maximum I don't know how many maybe 12,000 members that are less you know since this is creation I don't know how many there are.
[15:21:28.920 --> 15:21:39.920]  That we would end up in a country of what how many million are we having having two people running for president who are for out of Yale the order of skull and bones.
[15:21:39.920 --> 15:21:41.920]  I mean that just doesn't make sense.
[15:21:41.920 --> 15:21:51.920]  So anyway this is a quote that he has at this is from F O Matheson who was skull and bones 1923.
[15:21:51.920 --> 15:22:01.920]  My father was to Donald Ogden Stuart skull and bones 1916 an older guy.
[15:22:01.920 --> 15:22:05.920]  In regard to Matheson they called him Maddie.
[15:22:05.920 --> 15:22:12.920]  Maddie's upcoming appearance before the House Committee on American activities.
[15:22:12.920 --> 15:22:23.920]  So he's writing to his other skull and bones buddy you know soothing his concerns and saying don't you know don't worry we'll make it we're going to get by here you know we're going to get our agenda in basically.
[15:22:23.920 --> 15:22:33.920]  So Matheson says quote as long as we have somebody from bones himself right who can bring pressure on the committee.
[15:22:33.920 --> 15:22:37.920]  I should think we'll be all right.
[15:22:37.920 --> 15:22:40.920]  So that's very important quote.
[15:22:40.920 --> 15:22:48.920]  Now sudden goes on here and he says for over 170 years these people have met in secret.
[15:22:48.920 --> 15:22:55.920]  From out of their initiates come presidents senators judges cabinet secretaries and plenty of spooks.
[15:22:55.920 --> 15:23:04.920]  They are tokens of finance and industry and they have just recently installed a third skull and bones president of the United States.
[15:23:04.920 --> 15:23:06.920]  George Junior right.
[15:23:06.920 --> 15:23:10.920]  George W. Bush's secret name is temporary.
[15:23:10.920 --> 15:23:15.920]  His father George H. W. Bush's bones name is Macog.
[15:23:15.920 --> 15:23:22.920]  And his grandfather Prescott Sheldon Bush stole for the order one of their prized possessions Geronimo skull.
[15:23:22.920 --> 15:23:32.920]  But the order of skull and bones secrets have always been safe for the press of which meet much they owned.
[15:23:32.920 --> 15:23:39.920]  And that's why I think earlier you saw in this video I mentioned that or maybe I didn't.
[15:23:39.920 --> 15:23:49.920]  I've been writing letters to the press since 1975 that with a direct quote from a communist that regionalism is communism.
[15:23:49.920 --> 15:23:58.920]  And I was I've had other articles published but they would never go near that either they would take that quote out.
[15:23:58.920 --> 15:24:05.920]  That's the quote from a communist writer for the daily world writing for their own journal the daily world.
[15:24:05.920 --> 15:24:11.920]  And so when you talk about the control of the press it's complete the major media.
[15:24:11.920 --> 15:24:14.920]  I don't have to tell you folks that probably but anyway.
[15:24:14.920 --> 15:24:15.920]  All right.
[15:24:15.920 --> 15:24:20.920]  Now skull and bones bones men in this here's a little list.
[15:24:20.920 --> 15:24:28.920]  Life fortunes Henry loose Newsweek's E roll and money Harrowman Harrowman right.
[15:24:28.920 --> 15:24:32.920]  Calls communications Alfred Kells National Reviews William Buckley.
[15:24:32.920 --> 15:24:37.920]  Why he took us to the cleaners didn't he Atlantic Monthly's R. W. Davenport.
[15:24:37.920 --> 15:24:41.920]  I guess Buckley was the one that managed to get the conservatives in line.
[15:24:41.920 --> 15:24:44.920]  So they're supporting a planned economy and all right.
[15:24:44.920 --> 15:24:50.920]  He said that John Kenneth Galbraith was one of his best friends and he admired him so.
[15:24:50.920 --> 15:24:53.920]  Oh yes.
[15:24:53.920 --> 15:24:55.920]  Yes went after the birchers.
[15:24:55.920 --> 15:24:57.920]  He did terrible things Buckley.
[15:24:57.920 --> 15:25:00.920]  Atlantic Monthly's Davenport and among others.
[15:25:00.920 --> 15:25:07.920]  If the order is mentioned in the establishment press at all bones is defined as just a state way side for students.
[15:25:07.920 --> 15:25:10.920]  It's glory faded.
[15:25:10.920 --> 15:25:13.920]  This book is extremely important.
[15:25:13.920 --> 15:25:15.920]  I go on the Internet to get it.
[15:25:15.920 --> 15:25:16.920]  You said Alex has got it.
[15:25:16.920 --> 15:25:18.920]  Is that right?
[15:25:18.920 --> 15:25:20.920]  I think we do.
[15:25:20.920 --> 15:25:21.920]  You're right.
[15:25:21.920 --> 15:25:24.920]  Anthony Sutton was educated at universities London,
[15:25:24.920 --> 15:25:29.920]  Gottengan and California while research fellow at the prestigious Hoover Institute.
[15:25:29.920 --> 15:25:35.920]  He produced the monumental three volume series Western technology and Soviet economic development.
[15:25:35.920 --> 15:25:42.920]  Other books include the best enemy money can buy Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution Wall Street and Hitler and many other.
[15:25:42.920 --> 15:25:43.920]  All right.
[15:25:43.920 --> 15:25:46.920]  This is a picture of my grandfather.
[15:25:46.920 --> 15:25:50.920]  Samuel Clifton Thompson born in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.
[15:25:50.920 --> 15:26:00.920]  And this is taken this picture is taken just before he went out to South Africa as a mining engineer to open up the gold mines in South Africa.
[15:26:00.920 --> 15:26:06.920]  I might point out that he was the first member in the family from the order of skull and bones.
[15:26:06.920 --> 15:26:16.920]  And you'll be seeing later you're going to see a picture of grandpa and my father is coming up.
[15:26:16.920 --> 15:26:17.920]  Put down a little bit.
[15:26:17.920 --> 15:26:18.920]  Okay.
[15:26:18.920 --> 15:26:19.920]  There you go.
[15:26:19.920 --> 15:26:20.920]  Right there.
[15:26:20.920 --> 15:26:24.920]  And he lived out there from around 1897 and was there during the Boer War.
[15:26:24.920 --> 15:26:29.920]  And they returned in the break out of the first World War I.
[15:26:29.920 --> 15:26:32.920]  My father was born in South Africa, obviously.
[15:26:32.920 --> 15:26:37.920]  And my grandfather met a lovely gal from South from Australia.
[15:26:37.920 --> 15:26:39.920]  That was my grandmother.
[15:26:39.920 --> 15:26:41.920]  And she she had come.
[15:26:41.920 --> 15:26:42.920]  This is a very interesting story.
[15:26:42.920 --> 15:26:51.920]  She had come over with her father and 12 siblings on a sailing ship from Australia to Cape Town.
[15:26:51.920 --> 15:27:03.920]  My great grandfather from Australia had emigrated from England and was the clerk of the works or something in Melbourne, Australia.
[15:27:03.920 --> 15:27:05.920]  And they had all those children.
[15:27:05.920 --> 15:27:14.920]  And can you imagine traveling on a sailing ship back in 1895 or something with all those children.
[15:27:14.920 --> 15:27:21.920]  And anyway, my grandfather somehow met, we don't know how, my grandmother.
[15:27:21.920 --> 15:27:25.920]  And they were married in Johannesburg in 192.
[15:27:25.920 --> 15:27:27.920]  And he was a member of the Order at Yale.
[15:27:27.920 --> 15:27:32.920]  And he was very close to Sir A. Bailey and some of the Fabian Socialists.
[15:27:32.920 --> 15:27:38.920]  I don't really know what role he had in the activities of the Order, but I would imagine some.
[15:27:38.920 --> 15:27:44.920]  Because it was pretty big time, gold mining, and he was very instrumental in opening up the mines there.
[15:27:44.920 --> 15:27:47.920]  So that's Grandpa Thompson.
[15:27:47.920 --> 15:27:56.920]  Here is a picture of the same Grandpa a little bit later with my father and my sister, Victoria.
[15:27:56.920 --> 15:27:58.920]  And that's Grandpa.
[15:27:58.920 --> 15:28:00.920]  He's being very grandfatherly.
[15:28:00.920 --> 15:28:08.920]  This is probably around 1930, this picture.
[15:28:08.920 --> 15:28:18.920]  And that's my dad holding on to my sister, my dad, Clifton, who subsequently was tapped for the Order for his class at Yale.
[15:28:18.920 --> 15:28:36.920]  And with Grandpa, the one that I spoke to you about, who was the mining engineer that went from Pennsylvania to South Africa to open the gold mines in the late 1800s.
[15:28:36.920 --> 15:28:47.920]  This is an interesting picture here, which shows, I think that this looks like a bunch of skull and bones friends.
[15:28:47.920 --> 15:28:48.920]  I do believe.
[15:28:48.920 --> 15:28:53.920]  I'm going to show you the picture and then I will identify a bit for you.
[15:28:53.920 --> 15:29:01.920]  The one in the front row is Charles Spofford.
[15:29:01.920 --> 15:29:03.920]  And then we have my father.
[15:29:03.920 --> 15:29:04.920]  I'll explain a little bit.
[15:29:04.920 --> 15:29:11.920]  It's difficult to hold this up, but the one in the front row in the middle is Charles Spofford, a very close friend of my father's.
[15:29:11.920 --> 15:29:14.920]  And I really like Charles Spofford a lot.
[15:29:14.920 --> 15:29:27.920]  He ended up being the legal counsel from Davis Polk, Wardwell, Sunderland, Kendall, for the Suez Canal Company, and many, many other high positions.
[15:29:27.920 --> 15:29:34.920]  He rose to the top, getting all sorts of honorary medals from foreign governments in Europe and everywhere.
[15:29:34.920 --> 15:29:44.920]  And counsel on foreign relations and a lawyer and a very, very decent, nice man.
[15:29:44.920 --> 15:29:47.920]  He close to my father.
[15:29:47.920 --> 15:29:50.920]  He died about 25 years ago, I guess.
[15:29:50.920 --> 15:29:51.920]  An interesting man.
[15:29:51.920 --> 15:29:54.920]  He was born in Connecticut in California, I believe.
[15:29:54.920 --> 15:30:07.920]  And unlike the other bones of characters that were in that class, friends of my father's, he had not been to prep school.
[15:30:07.920 --> 15:30:10.920]  One of the fancy prep schools on the East Coast.
[15:30:10.920 --> 15:30:19.920]  He went to public school in California, which I do believe they must have had extremely good public schools back then because Charles Spofford was quite a scholar.
[15:30:19.920 --> 15:30:22.920]  And he was a very good musician.
[15:30:22.920 --> 15:30:32.920]  And very high up he became after World War II, which he served in in Europe as a lieutenant or something.
[15:30:32.920 --> 15:30:44.920]  After he got out, he was promoted way high up to one of the top positions in NATO, the North American Treaty Organization, and went on to be very influential in diplomatic circles.
[15:30:44.920 --> 15:30:53.920]  This is coming from being a boy in the public school system in California, rising to just really the highest heights imaginable.
[15:30:53.920 --> 15:30:54.920]  So that's Chuck.
[15:30:54.920 --> 15:31:02.920]  The other members that are shown there are close friends of my father's, Rebel McCallum and Fred Haynes, I think.
[15:31:02.920 --> 15:31:04.920]  I'm not going to tell you where they all are.
[15:31:04.920 --> 15:31:08.920]  My father is in the picture somewhere there in the second row, I think.
[15:31:08.920 --> 15:31:18.920]  And Edwin Blair, who was called Mr. Yale always because he was a great fundraiser for Yale.
[15:31:18.920 --> 15:31:20.920]  So he was Mr. Yale.
[15:31:20.920 --> 15:31:31.920]  He was also the gentleman that invited my dad to go out to Bohemian Grove for one week or whatever it was.
[15:31:31.920 --> 15:31:41.920]  It was through Edwin Blair that my father did go out there and when he returned, he wasn't terribly impressed with what was going on there.
[15:31:41.920 --> 15:31:48.920]  He said the food was excellent, the lectures were pretty good, everything was done very nicely, but he would never go back.
[15:31:48.920 --> 15:32:00.920]  So I'm making excuses for my dad because I don't think he was ever really very happy with the Yale agenda, the orders agenda.
[15:32:00.920 --> 15:32:21.920]  Although he stayed close to his friends, as you can see in this picture, they're all having a very good time on someone's boat or on the dock somewhere.
[15:32:21.920 --> 15:32:30.920]  This is the Skull and Bones Grandfather Clock. These clocks were given to members of the order when they got married.
[15:32:30.920 --> 15:32:46.920]  My father was married in 1927, I believe, and he ordered the clock from a clockmaker in South Carolina and I think that the order pays for the clock.
[15:32:46.920 --> 15:32:53.920]  It was a gift and all of them receive a clock when they get married, I believe that's the case.
[15:32:53.920 --> 15:33:03.920]  We had it in our house from the time I was born, of course, and I remember it best because it's so mellow and I would, as a young child,
[15:33:03.920 --> 15:33:11.920]  waiting for Santa Claus to arrive, go to bed at night and the clock would go off at every hour.
[15:33:11.920 --> 15:33:18.920]  My mom and dad, of course, were putting things under the tree and giving Santa Claus his peanut butter sandwich and banana,
[15:33:18.920 --> 15:33:24.920]  and I was sleeping and listening to the clock and then finally around five would strike five, then six,
[15:33:24.920 --> 15:33:31.920]  and I know I can get up now and I'd run down and Santa Claus had been there and the sandwich had been eaten
[15:33:31.920 --> 15:33:37.920]  and the clock would strike six thirty and then everybody would have to come down and deal with me.
[15:33:37.920 --> 15:33:43.920]  So I just have great memories of the clock and what the significance is with the clock.
[15:33:43.920 --> 15:33:52.920]  Dad used to always say, he was very firm about that, he never told us why, but don't ever let the clock wind down.
[15:33:52.920 --> 15:34:00.920]  Keep the clock wound sharp and always keep it five minutes ahead.
[15:34:00.920 --> 15:34:08.920]  And what that means, maybe it means they're five minutes ahead of everybody, the order has to keep five minutes ahead of all of us.
[15:34:08.920 --> 15:34:14.920]  And don't let it wind down because if you did that, they'd be getting five or ten minutes behind or more.
[15:34:14.920 --> 15:34:18.920]  And as a member of the family, you never talk about the order.
[15:34:18.920 --> 15:34:24.920]  My father never discussed anything about the order of any significance, really,
[15:34:24.920 --> 15:34:32.920]  although as we said earlier on, most of his friends were very close, very close friends were the order
[15:34:32.920 --> 15:34:41.920]  and all of them, all the ushers in his wedding were skull and bones, the order and friends all the way through life.
[15:34:41.920 --> 15:34:45.920]  But that had nothing to do with his own personal beliefs and all.
[15:34:45.920 --> 15:34:53.920]  He was not involved in any major political decisions affecting our country or our schools or anything.
[15:34:53.920 --> 15:34:59.920]  He was a wonderful mayor of several towns, a very strict constitutionalist,
[15:34:59.920 --> 15:35:04.920]  which certainly doesn't go along with what the order stands for.
[15:35:04.920 --> 15:35:11.920]  I mean, he would really cause trouble on the board if anybody deviated from the constitution.
[15:35:11.920 --> 15:35:16.920]  So that's just a little bit of a defense of a member of the order, my dad.
[15:35:16.920 --> 15:35:27.920]  And as you heard earlier on, before he died, he did say that he would help me if he could, if he had longer.
[15:35:27.920 --> 15:35:36.920]  So hopefully there are more members who come to that conclusion and maybe someday we won't have a problem with the order.
[15:35:36.920 --> 15:35:44.920]  I hope that the order doesn't continue causing all of us the problems that it's caused in the past, especially in education.
[15:35:44.920 --> 15:35:47.920]  Now we're going to get into the books.
[15:35:47.920 --> 15:36:00.920]  The books were originally, they'd never published the list of members in book form before.
[15:36:00.920 --> 15:36:02.920]  At least that's what my father told me.
[15:36:02.920 --> 15:36:09.920]  One day when he was ill, this is the catalogue of the membership of living members.
[15:36:09.920 --> 15:36:14.920]  Volume one, I think it's around 1978, the date on this.
[15:36:14.920 --> 15:36:20.920]  Well that one's 1977, let's take a look at this.
[15:36:20.920 --> 15:36:24.920]  Oh no, see this is October 1983.
[15:36:24.920 --> 15:36:25.920]  This is what happened.
[15:36:25.920 --> 15:36:30.920]  And dad, I was taking care of my father, he was dying of cancer in New Jersey,
[15:36:30.920 --> 15:36:35.920]  and my sister and I would rotate, go down there, we didn't want to put him in a nursing home.
[15:36:35.920 --> 15:36:41.920]  So one day, it was pretty close to the end of his life,
[15:36:41.920 --> 15:36:49.920]  the male brought these two books in the male, which are, one is this one,
[15:36:49.920 --> 15:36:56.920]  volume one, the living members, the catalogue of the living members as of 1983.
[15:36:56.920 --> 15:37:08.920]  And this is the catalogue of all the members as of May 1977.
[15:37:08.920 --> 15:37:14.920]  This is the living and the dead, as of May 1977.
[15:37:14.920 --> 15:37:16.920]  So this is really the updated one right here.
[15:37:16.920 --> 15:37:21.920]  Anyway, I was opening the mail because my father wasn't well, I was taking care of all the business things,
[15:37:21.920 --> 15:37:26.920]  male correspondence, and these arrived, and so I took them into dad and he said,
[15:37:26.920 --> 15:37:30.920]  golly, they're getting pretty fancy up there in New Haven.
[15:37:30.920 --> 15:37:32.920]  He said, what are they doing?
[15:37:32.920 --> 15:37:37.920]  Never been in book form before, and that was his little comment.
[15:37:37.920 --> 15:37:46.920]  And so I said, well, it is, you know, so we, around that time,
[15:37:46.920 --> 15:37:52.920]  I was working with Anthony Sutton on something because I was always very interested in US policy
[15:37:52.920 --> 15:37:56.920]  towards the Soviet Union, and he had done such remarkable work,
[15:37:56.920 --> 15:38:00.920]  aside from his great book, which came out subsequently on the order,
[15:38:00.920 --> 15:38:07.920]  but his work at the Hoover Institute in regard to United States transfer of technology
[15:38:07.920 --> 15:38:18.920]  and all sorts of information and money, et cetera, to the Soviet Union from the time of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[15:38:18.920 --> 15:38:25.920]  And so Sutton was very highly respected in that field, and he told me,
[15:38:25.920 --> 15:38:32.920]  it just was a fluke really, that he happened to call right at the time when the books had arrived
[15:38:32.920 --> 15:38:36.920]  because he said he couldn't understand what was all about.
[15:38:36.920 --> 15:38:42.920]  And I said, well, you may be interested, I think, in the order at Yale,
[15:38:42.920 --> 15:38:47.920]  and he said, I am interested in that.
[15:38:47.920 --> 15:38:49.920]  He said, I don't understand the connection.
[15:38:49.920 --> 15:38:55.920]  And I told him that I had the list in book form, and he said, you do?
[15:38:55.920 --> 15:38:56.920]  And I said, yeah.
[15:38:56.920 --> 15:38:59.920]  And he said, would you mind lending them to me?
[15:38:59.920 --> 15:39:03.920]  And he said, I'll get them right back to you, I promise, and I believed him.
[15:39:03.920 --> 15:39:08.920]  I said them, and he did get them back, and he called me, and he said,
[15:39:08.920 --> 15:39:15.920]  Charlotte, with all the research I've done through the years on USA to the Soviet Union
[15:39:15.920 --> 15:39:23.920]  and every imaginable aspect, once I got these lists copied,
[15:39:23.920 --> 15:39:27.920]  he went to a copying place to get it done, he must have done a pretty good job
[15:39:27.920 --> 15:39:32.920]  because they're still in good shape, I put them down on the dining room table
[15:39:32.920 --> 15:39:40.920]  and I looked, and all of a sudden, I knew, I had found what I was looking for.
[15:39:40.920 --> 15:39:47.920]  I'd found the names of the people involved in the foreign affairs of the United States,
[15:39:47.920 --> 15:39:52.920]  especially in the transfer of secrets and weapons, et cetera,
[15:39:52.920 --> 15:39:59.920]  and nuclear stuff to the Soviet Union and banking as well as banking.
[15:39:59.920 --> 15:40:02.920]  And he also mentioned Hitler.
[15:40:02.920 --> 15:40:08.920]  He said, I saw the movers and the shakers, and it became very clear to me
[15:40:08.920 --> 15:40:18.920]  that this one organization was, if not totally responsible, almost completely,
[15:40:18.920 --> 15:40:24.920]  really up there in responsibility for American foreign policy and economic policy.
[15:40:24.920 --> 15:40:30.920]  And then, subsequently, we found out education policy.
[15:40:30.920 --> 15:40:37.920]  I didn't know that at that time that Sutton was that deep into doing the research on education.
[15:40:37.920 --> 15:40:43.920]  I think he did the best job on education research, if anybody I can possibly think of,
[15:40:43.920 --> 15:40:51.920]  using, and I'll show you in a minute, the incredible research done in the Leipzig connection
[15:40:51.920 --> 15:40:54.920]  by Lance Leone, the Leipzig connection.
[15:40:54.920 --> 15:40:56.920]  I'll show you a picture of that book later.
[15:40:56.920 --> 15:41:04.920]  Sutton used that, I used it, and anyway, that is the history of these little black books,
[15:41:04.920 --> 15:41:08.920]  which he returned to me, and he was a very great gentleman.
[15:41:08.920 --> 15:41:14.920]  He said I really didn't ask him to keep my name private, but he decided on his own
[15:41:14.920 --> 15:41:23.920]  not to let anybody know where he got them from, and evidently, after my father died,
[15:41:23.920 --> 15:41:31.920]  he did, I guess, tell somebody, or maybe he didn't ever tell anybody.
[15:41:31.920 --> 15:41:32.920]  I'm not quite sure.
[15:41:32.920 --> 15:41:37.920]  I told people I didn't really care, but I do want to point out right here,
[15:41:37.920 --> 15:41:42.920]  at the end of my father's illness, before he died,
[15:41:42.920 --> 15:41:47.920]  because he had heard me discussing foreign affairs and education,
[15:41:47.920 --> 15:41:52.920]  especially with fellow Schlafly, who was putting together the book Child Abuse in the Classroom,
[15:41:52.920 --> 15:41:56.920]  which is a great book for parents out there watching, if they want to really find out
[15:41:56.920 --> 15:42:05.920]  all about truly documented programs that were used in the schools between 1965 and 1985,
[15:42:05.920 --> 15:42:08.920]  when we had the Protection of People's Rights Amendment hearings.
[15:42:08.920 --> 15:42:16.920]  The documentation is in that book, Child Abuse in the Classroom, which is at AmericanDeception.com,
[15:42:16.920 --> 15:42:18.920]  a marvelous book.
[15:42:18.920 --> 15:42:23.920]  And Phyllis and I, at this time, when I was taking care of my dad in 1984,
[15:42:23.920 --> 15:42:29.920]  were talking on the phone constantly about what was going on with global education,
[15:42:29.920 --> 15:42:36.920]  all the horrible values destroying programs, role playing, psychodrama,
[15:42:36.920 --> 15:42:41.920]  the worst stuff, death education, survival games where the kids have to decide
[15:42:41.920 --> 15:42:45.920]  who's going to be allowed in the lifeboat and who isn't,
[15:42:45.920 --> 15:42:48.920]  depending on what your category is in life.
[15:42:48.920 --> 15:42:52.920]  This stuff, my father was listening from the other room,
[15:42:52.920 --> 15:42:57.920]  because we had him downstairs in the room next to the kitchen so we could take care of him.
[15:42:57.920 --> 15:43:02.920]  And so he must have had some, I mean, I think I brainwashed him.
[15:43:02.920 --> 15:43:07.920]  I think I brainwashed my father at the end of his life because a week before he died,
[15:43:07.920 --> 15:43:12.920]  he looked at me, first of all, I said, did he want to read The New York Times?
[15:43:12.920 --> 15:43:15.920]  He really was at the point where he didn't read much.
[15:43:15.920 --> 15:43:18.920]  And I gave it to him and he just threw it on the floor.
[15:43:18.920 --> 15:43:20.920]  He was lying in bed.
[15:43:20.920 --> 15:43:26.920]  He threw it on the floor and he said, you know, if I had more time, I'd help you.
[15:43:26.920 --> 15:43:32.920]  So that was really wonderful, you know, that at least I feel at the end of his life.
[15:43:32.920 --> 15:43:35.920]  At least he understood his daughter.
[15:43:35.920 --> 15:43:37.920]  That was nice to know.
[15:43:37.920 --> 15:43:41.920]  He was to say to me, Shar, you're a very good writer,
[15:43:41.920 --> 15:43:44.920]  but I don't know whether I like what you write about.
[15:43:44.920 --> 15:43:47.920]  And I thought, well, that's a compliment from you.
[15:43:47.920 --> 15:43:49.920]  You're a good writer, too, and a speaker.
[15:43:49.920 --> 15:43:51.920]  He was always a very fine speaker.
[15:43:51.920 --> 15:43:54.920]  But I thought, OK, I've come a long ways.
[15:43:54.920 --> 15:43:59.920]  He thought I was a good writer, didn't like what I was writing about or what I was saying.
[15:43:59.920 --> 15:44:04.920]  And then finally he said, you know, if he had more time, he'd help me.
[15:44:04.920 --> 15:44:10.920]  So that, so you can say that with, I'm not making excuses for Scullum Bones members,
[15:44:10.920 --> 15:44:16.920]  but you could say that a good percentage of each class is really quite innocuous,
[15:44:16.920 --> 15:44:21.920]  even though they may still go to the island, you know, where they have the camping and all that,
[15:44:21.920 --> 15:44:28.920]  and Dad did that, and even though they may be bound to vote for the Scullum Bones candidate,
[15:44:28.920 --> 15:44:30.920]  like my father always voted for Bush,
[15:44:30.920 --> 15:44:35.920]  and my mother was a southern conservative who would vote for Barry Goldwater
[15:44:35.920 --> 15:44:38.920]  or make a mistake like I did and vote for Reagan.
[15:44:38.920 --> 15:44:42.920]  So their votes always canceled one another out,
[15:44:42.920 --> 15:44:47.920]  because Dad would have voted Scullum Bones candidate no matter what.
[15:44:47.920 --> 15:44:49.920]  Maybe they take a pledge or something.
[15:44:49.920 --> 15:44:56.920]  I don't know. Let's go for Dad.
[15:44:56.920 --> 15:45:03.920]  Thompson. I think I am even mentioned in this evil little book. Yes, I am.
[15:45:03.920 --> 15:45:07.920]  Thompson, 1924. There's Thompson.
[15:45:07.920 --> 15:45:09.920]  There's Thompson.
[15:45:09.920 --> 15:45:17.920]  And 1924, and you will see there where he was born and where he went to college,
[15:45:17.920 --> 15:45:21.920]  that he was married to my mother, that he was mayor of several towns.
[15:45:21.920 --> 15:45:24.920]  He was a very civic-minded person, and everybody loved him.
[15:45:24.920 --> 15:45:29.920]  He always got elected, the most generous person on earth that ever existed.
[15:45:29.920 --> 15:45:36.920]  If anybody had a problem, you know, he'd be writing on that, offering to help out no matter what.
[15:45:36.920 --> 15:45:41.920]  And he was a vastry man at the Episcopal Church,
[15:45:41.920 --> 15:45:47.920]  and I don't know what else Dad was, except he was the order at Yale.
[15:45:47.920 --> 15:45:50.920]  Anyway, did you get that picture okay?
[15:45:50.920 --> 15:45:52.920]  I did. I can even see your name on that.
[15:45:52.920 --> 15:45:59.920]  Oh, good. So it says, 1924, law retired, born January 3, 1903, Johannesburg, South Africa,
[15:45:59.920 --> 15:46:04.920]  where he resided, Mosley Road, Farhills in Jersey, worked at Appleton, Rice and Pair in New York,
[15:46:04.920 --> 15:46:11.920]  Council and Director Seba Corporation, 4664, Mayor's Sands Point, New York, 4047,
[15:46:11.920 --> 15:46:16.920]  Member Township Committee, Mendham, New Jersey, 61-71,
[15:46:16.920 --> 15:46:25.920]  married June 4, 1927, Charlotte Dyer, and daughter Victoria Romig and Charlotte.
[15:46:25.920 --> 15:46:32.920]  My goodness, my name is in the skull and bones little black book of members.
[15:46:32.920 --> 15:46:34.920]  I didn't even know that, huh?
[15:46:34.920 --> 15:46:37.920]  Well, good for you, Charlotte.
[15:46:37.920 --> 15:46:41.920]  I wonder what they say about me.
[15:46:41.920 --> 15:46:44.920]  Oh, they're so all to themselves. They probably don't even know about me.
[15:46:44.920 --> 15:46:47.920]  They probably don't even know about Dad anymore.
[15:46:47.920 --> 15:46:50.920]  So now we have...
[15:46:50.920 --> 15:46:52.920]  Well, this is an interesting one here.
[15:46:52.920 --> 15:46:54.920]  Oh, look at all these bushes.
[15:46:54.920 --> 15:46:59.920]  Bush, bush, bush, bush, bush.
[15:46:59.920 --> 15:47:01.920]  How about it?
[15:47:01.920 --> 15:47:03.920]  Let me give you it. There we are.
[15:47:03.920 --> 15:47:06.920]  Look, Bush, 1948, George Herbert Walker.
[15:47:06.920 --> 15:47:07.920]  Well, we're already...
[15:47:07.920 --> 15:47:12.920]  Oh, my representative to the UN Chairman of the Republic.
[15:47:12.920 --> 15:47:13.920]  This is a good one.
[15:47:13.920 --> 15:47:18.920]  George Herbert Walker, born in...
[15:47:18.920 --> 15:47:22.920]  He must have graduated in 1948, right?
[15:47:22.920 --> 15:47:27.920]  And born 1924 in Milton, Massachusetts,
[15:47:27.920 --> 15:47:33.920]  director CIA, Washington, D.C., residents in Washington,
[15:47:33.920 --> 15:47:37.920]  and president and chairman Zapata Offshore Company,
[15:47:37.920 --> 15:47:41.920]  58 to 66, member of U.S. Congress, 67, 70,
[15:47:41.920 --> 15:47:44.920]  U.S. permanent rep to the United Nations,
[15:47:44.920 --> 15:47:49.920]  ambassador, 71 to 72, chairman, Republican National Committee,
[15:47:49.920 --> 15:47:52.920]  73, 74, boy, he doesn't give up, does he?
[15:47:52.920 --> 15:47:57.920]  If U.S. liaison office peaking People's Republic of China,
[15:47:57.920 --> 15:48:05.920]  74, 75, lieutenant, junior grade, U.S. Navy, 42, 45,
[15:48:05.920 --> 15:48:12.920]  three air medals, Mary, January 6 to Barbara, 1945,
[15:48:12.920 --> 15:48:21.920]  children, George W, 1968, John E, Neil M,
[15:48:21.920 --> 15:48:24.920]  Marvin P, and Dorothy.
[15:48:24.920 --> 15:48:25.920]  Yeah, okay.
[15:48:25.920 --> 15:48:35.920]  Then we have, gosh, George Jr., 1968, born...
[15:48:35.920 --> 15:48:37.920]  I mean, that was the class.
[15:48:37.920 --> 15:48:43.920]  He was born in 1946 in New Haven, resides in Houston, Texas.
[15:48:43.920 --> 15:48:45.920]  That's all they have for him.
[15:48:45.920 --> 15:48:47.920]  Oh, this is an old book, see?
[15:48:47.920 --> 15:48:48.920]  Yeah, okay.
[15:48:48.920 --> 15:48:51.920]  James, I never knew about James, did you?
[15:48:51.920 --> 15:48:53.920]  Yeah, he's the brother.
[15:48:53.920 --> 15:48:54.920]  Well, I've heard of him.
[15:48:54.920 --> 15:48:55.920]  Okay.
[15:48:55.920 --> 15:48:58.920]  And I knew about the girl.
[15:48:58.920 --> 15:49:01.920]  Bush, 1953, Jonathan.
[15:49:01.920 --> 15:49:03.920]  I knew about him.
[15:49:03.920 --> 15:49:08.920]  He used to leave it, park his car in our garden in Camden
[15:49:08.920 --> 15:49:10.920]  before he would go out on a sailing trip.
[15:49:10.920 --> 15:49:11.920]  Somehow we must have met him.
[15:49:11.920 --> 15:49:14.920]  He was very nice, Jonathan.
[15:49:14.920 --> 15:49:18.920]  Yeah, he'd be gone for about a month on the island,
[15:49:18.920 --> 15:49:20.920]  whatever island, a vinyl island, or one of them,
[15:49:20.920 --> 15:49:22.920]  and he would leave his car in our garage,
[15:49:22.920 --> 15:49:25.920]  or in our parking lot.
[15:49:25.920 --> 15:49:27.920]  And he was rather a nice guy.
[15:49:27.920 --> 15:49:32.920]  And then we have Prescott, 1917.
[15:49:32.920 --> 15:49:34.920]  That's the year for him.
[15:49:34.920 --> 15:49:35.920]  That's important.
[15:49:35.920 --> 15:49:38.920]  He was born in 1895.
[15:49:38.920 --> 15:49:46.920]  Columbus, Ohio, died in October 8, 1972, New York, New York.
[15:49:46.920 --> 15:49:49.920]  Greenwich, Connecticut, Republican town meeting,
[15:49:49.920 --> 15:49:51.920]  32 to 52, moderator.
[15:49:51.920 --> 15:49:54.920]  Yale Corporation, 44 to 58,
[15:49:54.920 --> 15:49:57.920]  U.S. Senator from Connecticut,
[15:49:57.920 --> 15:50:00.920]  52 to 63, a longtime formerly partner,
[15:50:00.920 --> 15:50:02.920]  Brown Brothers-Haramancey.
[15:50:02.920 --> 15:50:04.920]  He got all that.
[15:50:04.920 --> 15:50:09.920]  And in August 6, 1921, Dorothy Walker married Dorothy Walker,
[15:50:09.920 --> 15:50:14.920]  and their children were George, Jonathan, William, and Nancy.
[15:50:14.920 --> 15:50:17.920]  Okay.
[15:50:17.920 --> 15:50:20.920]  That's that.
[15:50:20.920 --> 15:50:21.920]  That's the bushes.
[15:50:21.920 --> 15:50:23.920]  We could go through a lot of people.
[15:50:23.920 --> 15:50:24.920]  You know what's interesting?
[15:50:24.920 --> 15:50:26.920]  Let's just take a look here where it'd be.
[15:50:26.920 --> 15:50:29.920]  You want to take a look at Buckley, huh?
[15:50:29.920 --> 15:50:32.920]  The great leader of the conservative movement, huh?
[15:50:32.920 --> 15:50:35.920]  Buckley, William Frank.
[15:50:35.920 --> 15:50:38.920]  He graduated in 1950.
[15:50:38.920 --> 15:50:43.920]  This is the guy that was put up there as a good friend
[15:50:43.920 --> 15:50:45.920]  of the socialist economist.
[15:50:45.920 --> 15:50:46.920]  What's his name?
[15:50:46.920 --> 15:50:47.920]  The really socialist economist?
[15:50:47.920 --> 15:50:48.920]  I can't remember his name.
[15:50:48.920 --> 15:50:49.920]  They were always such good friends.
[15:50:49.920 --> 15:50:51.920]  I always wondered how that could be.
[15:50:51.920 --> 15:50:55.920]  No, I can't remember right now, but he's very well known.
[15:50:55.920 --> 15:50:59.920]  Anyway, Buckley.
[15:50:59.920 --> 15:51:03.920]  Gosh, there are a lot of Buckleys.
[15:51:03.920 --> 15:51:08.920]  There's Christopher Taylor, New York City author, editor,
[15:51:08.920 --> 15:51:09.920]  journalist.
[15:51:09.920 --> 15:51:10.920]  I wonder if he's related.
[15:51:10.920 --> 15:51:14.920]  He's chief speechwriter, the vice president of the United States.
[15:51:14.920 --> 15:51:18.920]  Buckley, Fergus Reed writing.
[15:51:18.920 --> 15:51:19.920]  Paris, France.
[15:51:19.920 --> 15:51:21.920]  Novelists and lecturer.
[15:51:21.920 --> 15:51:24.920]  They're all in media, right?
[15:51:24.920 --> 15:51:26.920]  It could well be they're related, huh?
[15:51:26.920 --> 15:51:29.920]  Then we have James.
[15:51:29.920 --> 15:51:31.920]  He was Bill Buckley's brother.
[15:51:31.920 --> 15:51:34.920]  Pretty good guy, I believe.
[15:51:34.920 --> 15:51:39.920]  He was president of Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty in Munich,
[15:51:39.920 --> 15:51:40.920]  West Germany.
[15:51:40.920 --> 15:51:42.920]  What a joke those places were.
[15:51:42.920 --> 15:51:45.920]  They led the poor Hungarians.
[15:51:45.920 --> 15:51:48.920]  We let Hungary go down right down the tube.
[15:51:48.920 --> 15:51:52.920]  We did all the broadcasting to get them to revolt with Radio Free
[15:51:52.920 --> 15:51:55.920]  Europe, and then they revolted and then the Soviets struck.
[15:51:55.920 --> 15:52:00.920]  In 1956, I guess, the Hungarian Revolution.
[15:52:00.920 --> 15:52:01.920]  Horrible.
[15:52:01.920 --> 15:52:04.920]  So that's what Radio Free Europe did.
[15:52:04.920 --> 15:52:06.920]  Well, it must have done some good things.
[15:52:06.920 --> 15:52:07.920]  Okay.
[15:52:07.920 --> 15:52:11.920]  He was U.S. senator from New York.
[15:52:11.920 --> 15:52:12.920]  The Navy.
[15:52:12.920 --> 15:52:13.920]  Married.
[15:52:13.920 --> 15:52:14.920]  Peter.
[15:52:14.920 --> 15:52:18.920]  He was U.S. senator from New York for a very short time,
[15:52:18.920 --> 15:52:20.920]  and I wondered why.
[15:52:20.920 --> 15:52:22.920]  He went in and he never ran again.
[15:52:22.920 --> 15:52:24.920]  This is his brother.
[15:52:24.920 --> 15:52:25.920]  Now, here we go.
[15:52:25.920 --> 15:52:29.920]  William Frank Buckley.
[15:52:29.920 --> 15:52:32.920]  Born in 1925.
[15:52:32.920 --> 15:52:37.920]  President National Review.
[15:52:37.920 --> 15:52:40.920]  He was associate editor of American Mercury.
[15:52:40.920 --> 15:52:43.920]  So he was really, that was very good.
[15:52:43.920 --> 15:52:47.920]  That was a really true blue, wonderful, conservative magazine
[15:52:47.920 --> 15:52:48.920]  that he was editor of.
[15:52:48.920 --> 15:52:50.920]  That's rather interesting.
[15:52:50.920 --> 15:52:54.920]  He went in there early to, you know, do damage everywhere, I guess.
[15:52:54.920 --> 15:52:58.920]  Editor-in-Chief National Review, syndicated columnist, TV host
[15:52:58.920 --> 15:53:02.920]  firing line, chairman of the Board Star Broadcasting Group,
[15:53:02.920 --> 15:53:05.920]  author of several books, appointed by Nixon to five member
[15:53:05.920 --> 15:53:09.920]  USIA advisory committee, appointed by the president public
[15:53:09.920 --> 15:53:14.920]  member of the U.S. delegation to 28th General Assembly of the
[15:53:14.920 --> 15:53:20.920]  U.N. Host of PBS Great Performances Broadside Revisited.
[15:53:20.920 --> 15:53:22.920]  Second Lieutenant U.S. Infantry.
[15:53:22.920 --> 15:53:24.920]  Well, that must have been tough.
[15:53:24.920 --> 15:53:25.920]  What was that?
[15:53:25.920 --> 15:53:26.920]  44 to 46.
[15:53:26.920 --> 15:53:29.920]  Right at the, you know, that's the nasty end of the war.
[15:53:29.920 --> 15:53:31.920]  Married to Patricia Taylor.
[15:53:31.920 --> 15:53:33.920]  Okay.
[15:53:33.920 --> 15:53:35.920]  Was it mentioned in the CIA?
[15:53:35.920 --> 15:53:37.920]  No.
[15:53:37.920 --> 15:53:40.920]  But he was confirmed to the CIA, wasn't he?
[15:53:40.920 --> 15:53:42.920]  He certainly was.
[15:53:42.920 --> 15:53:45.920]  With Ward, what's his name and all of them?
[15:53:45.920 --> 15:53:47.920]  Maybe they don't put that in.
[15:53:47.920 --> 15:53:50.920]  CIA, huh?
[15:53:50.920 --> 15:53:56.920]  And here we got Frederick McGeorge Bundy, the one that's listed
[15:53:56.920 --> 15:54:01.920]  in the NEA's Cardinal Principles pre-planning board.
[15:54:01.920 --> 15:54:03.920]  This is very important.
[15:54:03.920 --> 15:54:07.920]  So at the top, the NEA has all these characters.
[15:54:07.920 --> 15:54:12.920]  These rotten leftist educators and government people, top
[15:54:12.920 --> 15:54:14.920]  skull and bones people.
[15:54:14.920 --> 15:54:15.920]  All right.
[15:54:15.920 --> 15:54:19.920]  There's McGeorge Bundy and there is Frederick McGeorge Bundy.
[15:54:19.920 --> 15:54:20.920]  Isn't that interesting?
[15:54:20.920 --> 15:54:23.920]  So McGeorge Bundy's the one we want.
[15:54:23.920 --> 15:54:25.920]  His brother was the other one.
[15:54:25.920 --> 15:54:26.920]  Is that something?
[15:54:26.920 --> 15:54:29.920]  Two brothers were the order at Yale.
[15:54:29.920 --> 15:54:32.920]  This is sort of fascinating stuff.
[15:54:32.920 --> 15:54:34.920]  And then William Bundy.
[15:54:34.920 --> 15:54:35.920]  All right.
[15:54:35.920 --> 15:54:37.920]  So McGeorge Bundy.
[15:54:37.920 --> 15:54:43.920]  And remember that he was listed on the NEA's Cardinal Principles
[15:54:43.920 --> 15:54:47.920]  revisited in 1976, which was the total international world
[15:54:47.920 --> 15:54:50.920]  government document, Education for World Government,
[15:54:50.920 --> 15:54:51.920]  basically.
[15:54:51.920 --> 15:54:54.920]  He was listed with all the rotten educators, Theodore
[15:54:54.920 --> 15:54:57.920]  Seizer, everyone you could imagine.
[15:54:57.920 --> 15:54:59.920]  And anyway, here we go.
[15:54:59.920 --> 15:55:03.920]  And Rockefeller, David Rockefeller, which makes one ask
[15:55:03.920 --> 15:55:09.920]  at the top of the NEA, how many teachers know that the NEA at
[15:55:09.920 --> 15:55:17.920]  the top is allied with the Rockefellers and the insiders
[15:55:17.920 --> 15:55:22.920]  and the establishment and the very people that everybody
[15:55:22.920 --> 15:55:27.920]  will tell you the NEA abhors.
[15:55:27.920 --> 15:55:28.920]  So anyway, here we go.
[15:55:28.920 --> 15:55:29.920]  McGeorge Bundy.
[15:55:29.920 --> 15:55:35.920]  Born 1919, Professor of History, NYU.
[15:55:35.920 --> 15:55:37.920]  Lived at 133 East 80th Street in New York.
[15:55:37.920 --> 15:55:40.920]  They all have good addresses.
[15:55:40.920 --> 15:55:43.920]  Lecturer, Associate Professor of Government,
[15:55:43.920 --> 15:55:45.920]  Dean of Faculty Arts and Sciences,
[15:55:45.920 --> 15:55:48.920]  53 to 61 at Harvard.
[15:55:48.920 --> 15:55:50.920]  Arts and Sciences, that's interesting.
[15:55:50.920 --> 15:55:53.920]  Special Assistant for National Security Affairs
[15:55:53.920 --> 15:55:58.920]  to President Kennedy and Johnson, 1961 to 66.
[15:55:58.920 --> 15:56:02.920]  President of the Ford Foundation, okay,
[15:56:02.920 --> 15:56:04.920]  Brown-Gather.
[15:56:04.920 --> 15:56:07.920]  1966 to 79.
[15:56:07.920 --> 15:56:10.920]  He was 10 years after Gather.
[15:56:10.920 --> 15:56:14.920]  He knew, same thing that Gather told Dodd.
[15:56:14.920 --> 15:56:21.920]  Captain A. United States, 1942 to 1946.
[15:56:21.920 --> 15:56:22.920]  Can you imagine?
[15:56:22.920 --> 15:56:25.920]  They were really in the nasty wars and all.
[15:56:25.920 --> 15:56:29.920]  Maybe that's what caused them to be so world government-oriented.
[15:56:29.920 --> 15:56:30.920]  I don't know.
[15:56:30.920 --> 15:56:33.920]  Well, they learned it at the order of Yale, I guess.
[15:56:33.920 --> 15:56:35.920]  Okay, nothing more of interest there.
[15:56:35.920 --> 15:56:40.920]  Mary de Mary Lothrop, the children and all.
[15:56:40.920 --> 15:56:42.920]  And William Bundy, okay, this is another one.
[15:56:42.920 --> 15:56:44.920]  This is the other one that's important.
[15:56:44.920 --> 15:56:46.920]  Journalism.
[15:56:46.920 --> 15:56:49.920]  This has got to be his brother.
[15:56:49.920 --> 15:56:56.920]  Editor of Foreign Affairs, okay, CFR.
[15:56:56.920 --> 15:56:59.920]  Yale Corporation, Covington-Berling-Wafferm.

[15:57:08.920 --> 15:57:10.920]  Oh, whoa.
[15:57:10.920 --> 15:57:15.920]  Staff Director, President's Commission on National Goals.
[15:57:15.920 --> 15:57:17.920]  That was a bad commission.
[15:57:17.920 --> 15:57:21.920]  Covington covered that in her book.
[15:57:21.920 --> 15:57:23.920]  National Goals, all right.
[15:57:23.920 --> 15:57:30.920]  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, International Security Affairs.
[15:57:30.920 --> 15:57:37.920]  Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, 64 to 69.

[15:57:40.920 --> 15:57:43.920]  Legion of Merit, British MBE.
[15:57:43.920 --> 15:57:46.920]  Merit to Mary Atchison.
[15:57:46.920 --> 15:57:48.920]  I wonder if that's Dean Atchison.
[15:57:48.920 --> 15:57:52.920]  Michael and Christopher, okay.
[15:57:52.920 --> 15:57:55.920]  Well, you know, really, these people are something else, aren't they?
[15:57:55.920 --> 15:57:57.920]  They are important.
[15:57:57.920 --> 15:58:00.920]  They are very important.
[15:58:00.920 --> 15:58:05.920]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[15:58:05.920 --> 15:58:06.920]  Tyranny is here.
[15:58:06.920 --> 15:58:10.920]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[15:58:10.920 --> 15:58:12.920]  It really says that the state is God.
[15:58:12.920 --> 15:58:17.920]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[15:58:17.920 --> 15:58:22.920]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[15:58:22.920 --> 15:58:24.920]  now being expanded nationwide.
[15:58:24.920 --> 15:58:30.920]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[15:58:30.920 --> 15:58:34.920]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[15:58:34.920 --> 15:58:38.920]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[15:58:38.920 --> 15:58:44.920]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[15:58:44.920 --> 15:58:48.920]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[15:58:48.920 --> 15:58:50.920]  The police state isn't coming.
[15:58:50.920 --> 15:58:51.920]  It's here.

[15:59:12.920 --> 15:59:21.920]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[15:59:21.920 --> 15:59:24.920]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[15:59:24.920 --> 15:59:31.920]  Sooner or later, go and tell that midnight writer, tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter.
[15:59:31.920 --> 15:59:42.920]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down, tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[15:59:42.920 --> 15:59:45.920]  Well, my goodness, traces, let me tell you the news.
[15:59:45.920 --> 15:59:48.920]  My head's been wet with the midnight dew.
[15:59:48.920 --> 15:59:53.920]  I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee.
[15:59:53.920 --> 15:59:59.920]  He spoke to me of the voice so sweet, I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sweet.
[15:59:59.920 --> 16:00:02.920]  He called my name and my heart stood still.
[16:00:02.920 --> 16:00:07.920]  When he said, John, go do my will, go tell that long tongue liar.
[16:00:07.920 --> 16:00:14.920]  Go and tell that midnight writer, tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter.
[16:00:14.920 --> 16:00:21.920]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down, tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[16:00:21.920 --> 16:00:31.920]  Run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[16:00:31.920 --> 16:00:34.920]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[16:00:34.920 --> 16:00:38.920]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[16:00:38.920 --> 16:00:45.920]  When he may throw you rock, hide your hand, working in the dark against your fellow man.
[16:00:45.920 --> 16:00:50.920]  But if sure it's God, made black and white, what's done in the dark will be brought to the light.
[16:00:50.920 --> 16:00:55.920]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[16:00:55.920 --> 16:01:00.920]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[16:01:00.920 --> 16:01:06.920]  And I went to bed for a couple hours while Aaron felt in and Paul Watson.
[16:01:06.920 --> 16:01:10.920]  And then, of course, we just premiered that amazing part one.
[16:01:10.920 --> 16:01:12.920]  We've got eight hours of it.
[16:01:12.920 --> 16:01:20.920]  So I guess it's part, part one of eight of the Charlotte Isherby information.
[16:01:20.920 --> 16:01:23.920]  She's the lady that exposed her bones, gave the information to Anthony Sutton.
[16:01:23.920 --> 16:01:26.920]  But I was back there asleep on the couch in the hallway.
[16:01:26.920 --> 16:01:29.920]  The guys just came and got me up.
[16:01:29.920 --> 16:01:38.920]  And we are now, I don't know how many hours are we into this fourth annual money bomb against the New World Order?
[16:01:38.920 --> 16:01:44.920]  I mean, I am, I am, I am operating on about two cylinders, 21 hours into this.
[16:01:44.920 --> 16:01:51.920]  And I don't have a sore throat from talking.
[16:01:51.920 --> 16:01:56.920]  It was just, here's the thing.
[16:01:56.920 --> 16:01:59.920]  I don't smoke cigarettes anymore.
[16:01:59.920 --> 16:02:04.920]  I don't until I do some special event or something.
[16:02:04.920 --> 16:02:08.920]  And one person in the office of smoked cigarettes and I smoked one cigarette.
[16:02:08.920 --> 16:02:12.920]  And then I said, go get me some.
[16:02:12.920 --> 16:02:17.920]  And during breaks, I think I sucked down an entire package of cigarettes last night.
[16:02:17.920 --> 16:02:19.920]  I mean, what is my problem?
[16:02:19.920 --> 16:02:27.920]  And now I, and now I feel like I just gargled with broken beer bottles or something.
[16:02:27.920 --> 16:02:32.920]  I mean, oh man, this is, this is not fun.
[16:02:32.920 --> 16:02:34.920]  Actually, oh God.
[16:02:34.920 --> 16:02:35.920]  All right.
[16:02:35.920 --> 16:02:41.920]  Gerald Solente, the illustrious trends forecaster is going to be with us for the next hour and a half.
[16:02:41.920 --> 16:02:49.920]  And I am just very, very, very, very honored that he's with us.
[16:02:49.920 --> 16:02:54.920]  I know the crew is, a lot of them are here today.
[16:02:54.920 --> 16:02:59.920]  Gerald Solente's website, of course, is trendsresearchs.com.
[16:02:59.920 --> 16:03:10.920]  And I couldn't think of a better person to have on with the whole Euro situation,
[16:03:10.920 --> 16:03:14.920]  the incredible Homeland Security calls for a strict free speech.
[16:03:14.920 --> 16:03:23.920]  Just the Orwellian weirdness that we are now facing as a society.
[16:03:23.920 --> 16:03:33.920]  And again, Gerald Solente joins us, is joining us here in a moment of trendsresearch.com.
[16:03:33.920 --> 16:03:39.920]  I want to also go over to infowars.com and check on the donations,
[16:03:39.920 --> 16:03:50.920]  because we've built quite a compound over here of pro-liberty, pro-freedom, news websites, films,
[16:03:50.920 --> 16:03:54.920]  the nightly news show.
[16:03:54.920 --> 16:03:57.920]  Jesse Ventura called me last night.
[16:03:57.920 --> 16:04:00.920]  God, I have about 11 o'clock at night.
[16:04:00.920 --> 16:04:02.920]  Well, I got a call earlier than that from Tyrell.
[16:04:02.920 --> 16:04:06.920]  Then a call from Jesse about the judge just completely throwing out his TSA suit.
[16:04:06.920 --> 16:04:08.920]  I mean, you can't even be heard.
[16:04:08.920 --> 16:04:10.920]  Just know even discussion of the Fourth Amendment,
[16:04:10.920 --> 16:04:13.920]  because it's all under martial law and Homeland Security.
[16:04:13.920 --> 16:04:15.920]  They're not running checkpoints on the highway.
[16:04:15.920 --> 16:04:19.920]  We've got a link to that at infowars.com.
[16:04:19.920 --> 16:04:22.920]  That's all coming up as well.
[16:04:22.920 --> 16:04:25.920]  Of course, we had George Norrie on last night with us.
[16:04:25.920 --> 16:04:26.920]  That was extremely informative.
[16:04:26.920 --> 16:04:31.920]  We appreciate George spending time with us.
[16:04:31.920 --> 16:04:36.920]  This is just going to be a very power-packed hour-and-a-half interview coming up.
[16:04:36.920 --> 16:04:47.920]  And then I have Jim Mars, Alan Watt joining us along with Bob Chapman.
[16:04:47.920 --> 16:04:50.920]  Man, I tell you, kids, never smoke cigarettes.
[16:04:50.920 --> 16:04:52.920]  That's all I can say.
[16:04:52.920 --> 16:04:54.920]  What in the world?
[16:04:54.920 --> 16:05:01.920]  We've raised $223,000 and that will hire a pair of four people
[16:05:01.920 --> 16:05:03.920]  and get a lot of the equipment we need.
[16:05:03.920 --> 16:05:05.920]  I understand we're in a depression.
[16:05:05.920 --> 16:05:11.920]  Without even trying, we've raised $400,000 and something last year.
[16:05:11.920 --> 16:05:15.920]  I didn't push this as hard as I did the year before.
[16:05:15.920 --> 16:05:19.920]  And I've told people, I don't want people donating who are on a shoestring or something.
[16:05:19.920 --> 16:05:20.920]  Do not do it.
[16:05:20.920 --> 16:05:23.920]  But for all of you middle-class folks that don't want to be collectivized
[16:05:23.920 --> 16:05:25.920]  and taken over by the corporate banker board,
[16:05:25.920 --> 16:05:29.920]  it's a good time to donate at infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[16:05:29.920 --> 16:05:32.920]  We just look at the last 21 hours of information you've seen and heard here.
[16:05:32.920 --> 16:05:36.920]  Now is the time to step up to the plate and take action.
[16:05:36.920 --> 16:05:38.920]  We're not the government that comes in forcibly.
[16:05:38.920 --> 16:05:42.920]  Takes your money at the barrel of a gun and then uses it against you.
[16:05:42.920 --> 16:05:46.920]  Or we're not globalist-funded NPR that still has fundraisers.
[16:05:46.920 --> 16:05:50.920]  There's this idea of demonizing alternative media and news systems
[16:05:50.920 --> 16:05:59.920]  because they don't want us to ever get together.
[16:05:59.920 --> 16:06:03.920]  Now again, ladies and gentlemen, infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[16:06:03.920 --> 16:06:05.920]  That's infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[16:06:05.920 --> 16:06:07.920]  We got a few folks up there answering the phones right now.
[16:06:07.920 --> 16:06:13.920]  888-253-3139. 888-253-3139.
[16:06:13.920 --> 16:06:15.920]  We'll have open phones later as well.
[16:06:15.920 --> 16:06:18.920]  And I want to, from the bottom of my heart, thank all of you over the years
[16:06:18.920 --> 16:06:20.920]  that have bought the books, the videos, the t-shirts,
[16:06:20.920 --> 16:06:22.920]  the PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[16:06:22.920 --> 16:06:24.920]  We've got a 15-day free trial going right now,
[16:06:24.920 --> 16:06:25.920]  but all the streams are up there.
[16:06:25.920 --> 16:06:29.920]  All of you that sent the linked infowarsmoneybomb out to people
[16:06:29.920 --> 16:06:33.920]  with the free video stream, all of it.
[16:06:33.920 --> 16:06:34.920]  We couldn't have done this without you.
[16:06:34.920 --> 16:06:37.920]  But especially those of you that did donate.
[16:06:37.920 --> 16:06:39.920]  But again, spreadin' the word is donating.
[16:06:39.920 --> 16:06:41.920]  Buying a bumper sticker is donating.
[16:06:41.920 --> 16:06:43.920]  Donating at the website is donating, obviously.
[16:06:43.920 --> 16:06:44.920]  Thank you so much.
[16:06:44.920 --> 16:06:49.920]  infowarsmoneybomb.com or 888-253-3139.
[16:06:49.920 --> 16:06:54.920]  Well, I take you now to Gerald Salente, who really needs no introduction,
[16:06:54.920 --> 16:06:58.920]  but bestselling author, researcher, earlier in life, you know,
[16:06:58.920 --> 16:07:02.920]  was a lobbyist consultant, worked for high-powered politicians,
[16:07:02.920 --> 16:07:05.920]  shot from the inside and the outside of the corporate world,
[16:07:05.920 --> 16:07:06.920]  government world.
[16:07:06.920 --> 16:07:10.920]  And he has predicted much of what is now unfolded.
[16:07:10.920 --> 16:07:14.920]  And instead of me and myself throwing out all the issues I want to go over
[16:07:14.920 --> 16:07:19.920]  with him, which I will, I want to just first welcome Gerald.
[16:07:19.920 --> 16:07:21.920]  Gerald, good to have you with us.
[16:07:21.920 --> 16:07:22.920]  Oh, thanks.
[16:07:22.920 --> 16:07:25.920]  And best of good fortune with your fundraising.
[16:07:25.920 --> 16:07:26.920]  Well, we got to do it.
[16:07:26.920 --> 16:07:29.920]  You know, we need to be robust in the fight against the globalist.
[16:07:29.920 --> 16:07:33.920]  And it's just great to have other folks like you out there as well,
[16:07:33.920 --> 16:07:39.920]  because certainly it brings diversity to the debate and depth
[16:07:39.920 --> 16:07:40.920]  of the understanding.
[16:07:40.920 --> 16:07:43.920]  But also then we're not lone targets out there, my friend.
[16:07:43.920 --> 16:07:47.920]  Gerald, on your radar screen, what are you most focused on right now?
[16:07:47.920 --> 16:07:49.920]  Well, there are two things.
[16:07:49.920 --> 16:07:58.920]  The European crisis and the pending next war they're going to lead us into.
[16:07:58.920 --> 16:08:03.920]  You know, people say, for example, that, you know, Obama's hands are tied.
[16:08:03.920 --> 16:08:05.920]  He only could do so much.
[16:08:05.920 --> 16:08:06.920]  Oh, yeah.
[16:08:06.920 --> 16:08:09.920]  Look how his hands are untied when he took us to war with Libya.
[16:08:09.920 --> 16:08:10.920]  Remember that little beauty?
[16:08:10.920 --> 16:08:12.920]  And a little kid with her job blown off.
[16:08:12.920 --> 16:08:13.920]  Yeah, that was real.
[16:08:13.920 --> 16:08:14.920]  That's peace price.
[16:08:14.920 --> 16:08:15.920]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[16:08:15.920 --> 16:08:20.920]  And also, of course, the humanitarian mission as they destroyed cities
[16:08:20.920 --> 16:08:21.920]  throughout Libya.
[16:08:21.920 --> 16:08:26.920]  But anyway, the point is, is that on one end, you can see what they can do
[16:08:26.920 --> 16:08:28.920]  and won't do.
[16:08:28.920 --> 16:08:31.920]  And on the other end, you see what they're incapable of doing.
[16:08:31.920 --> 16:08:34.920]  And the incapable is the European crisis.
[16:08:34.920 --> 16:08:38.920]  And what they're doing now is they're focusing on Greece, of course.
[16:08:38.920 --> 16:08:44.920]  And when you look at Greece, it's the smallest country among the European
[16:08:44.920 --> 16:08:46.920]  Monetary Union nations.
[16:08:46.920 --> 16:08:48.920]  And they're in trouble.
[16:08:48.920 --> 16:08:53.920]  So they're saying now, if Greece goes default, everything's going to collapse.
[16:08:53.920 --> 16:08:58.920]  Well, if the tiniest one is going to go bust, what's going to happen to the rest
[16:08:58.920 --> 16:09:07.920]  of those pigs, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Spain, along with Greece?
[16:09:07.920 --> 16:09:13.920]  So now we're looking at a GDP to debt ratio in Italy that's off the charts.
[16:09:13.920 --> 16:09:16.920]  They're not going to be able to pay back their debt.
[16:09:16.920 --> 16:09:21.920]  You're looking at a half a billion dollars, a trillion dollars rather,
[16:09:21.920 --> 16:09:23.920]  than just in Greece.
[16:09:23.920 --> 16:09:28.920]  And so you hear them say things that if Greeks don't agree to the terms
[16:09:28.920 --> 16:09:35.920]  set by the European Monetary Union and the others in the Troika,
[16:09:35.920 --> 16:09:40.920]  that they're not going to loan them a couple of billion dollars.
[16:09:40.920 --> 16:09:43.920]  So the couple of billion dollars that they're going to loan them
[16:09:43.920 --> 16:09:45.920]  is not going to make any difference.
[16:09:45.920 --> 16:09:47.920]  These are not bailouts.
[16:09:47.920 --> 16:09:50.920]  These are adding more debt on top of old debt.
[16:09:50.920 --> 16:09:52.920]  They're going to put the whole thing together.
[16:09:52.920 --> 16:09:54.920]  There is no way out.
[16:09:54.920 --> 16:09:59.920]  The only thing the Europeans are doing is what the Fed is doing.
[16:09:59.920 --> 16:10:03.920]  And that's printing more digital money, not worth the paper.
[16:10:03.920 --> 16:10:05.920]  It's not printed on.
[16:10:05.920 --> 16:10:12.920]  So then you look at what Silvio Berlusconi, or I like to say Berlusconi,
[16:10:12.920 --> 16:10:16.920]  because boy, it's one freak show over there.
[16:10:16.920 --> 16:10:22.920]  And in Italy, and he came out this week and he said that the euro
[16:10:22.920 --> 16:10:28.920]  is a strange currency that has not convinced anyone.
[16:10:28.920 --> 16:10:30.920]  Now think of that.
[16:10:30.920 --> 16:10:35.920]  This is Berlusconi, one of the major economic forces in the world,
[16:10:35.920 --> 16:10:42.920]  calling the euro a strange currency that hasn't convinced anyone.
[16:10:42.920 --> 16:10:45.920]  That should be headline news.
[16:10:45.920 --> 16:10:47.920]  Na, na, na.
[16:10:47.920 --> 16:10:51.920]  It's one little sentence printed on a Saturday
[16:10:51.920 --> 16:10:53.920]  that most people don't read the newspaper,
[16:10:53.920 --> 16:10:56.920]  and then of course he retracted it later.
[16:10:56.920 --> 16:11:01.920]  What he's saying is the whole thing is a Ponzi scheme
[16:11:01.920 --> 16:11:04.920]  and it's all collapsing around us.
[16:11:04.920 --> 16:11:07.920]  There is no way out.
[16:11:07.920 --> 16:11:09.920]  What's the good news?
[16:11:09.920 --> 16:11:14.920]  Listen to public enemy number one, Osama bin Bernanke.
[16:11:14.920 --> 16:11:19.920]  He said, you know, the Fed slashed their growth rate.
[16:11:19.920 --> 16:11:21.920]  Slashed their growth rate.
[16:11:21.920 --> 16:11:24.920]  They got it wrong, or they lied.
[16:11:24.920 --> 16:11:27.920]  And that they're, oh, they're sorry that, you know,
[16:11:27.920 --> 16:11:31.920]  the economy isn't coming along as they expected.
[16:11:31.920 --> 16:11:33.920]  You know, who could get away with this?
[16:11:33.920 --> 16:11:36.920]  So what does the market go up on, the stock market?
[16:11:36.920 --> 16:11:39.920]  The two good pieces of news.
[16:11:39.920 --> 16:11:45.920]  Number one, that the European central banks just cut their interest rates.
[16:11:45.920 --> 16:11:48.920]  Cut their interest rates? What does that mean?
[16:11:48.920 --> 16:11:51.920]  Well, that means loose money policy.
[16:11:51.920 --> 16:11:53.920]  Loose money policy?
[16:11:53.920 --> 16:11:56.920]  That means printing more crap.
[16:11:56.920 --> 16:12:00.920]  Gold went up $30 on that news and the other good news
[16:12:00.920 --> 16:12:04.920]  as to why the market is going up in the states
[16:12:04.920 --> 16:12:10.920]  because they expect the Fed to do quantitative easing free.
[16:12:10.920 --> 16:12:15.920]  So the whole thing, Alex, is collapsing in front of us
[16:12:15.920 --> 16:12:19.920]  and all they're doing is to put on a show
[16:12:19.920 --> 16:12:23.920]  as they're putting on right now over in France
[16:12:23.920 --> 16:12:26.920]  as the G20 you're meeting.
[16:12:26.920 --> 16:12:29.920]  And all you do is have to show footage
[16:12:29.920 --> 16:12:35.920]  of the world leaders going to the G20 meeting.
[16:12:35.920 --> 16:12:39.920]  It makes the Academy Awards look like a two-bit show.
[16:12:39.920 --> 16:12:45.920]  You know, they say that politics is show business for ugly people.
[16:12:45.920 --> 16:12:49.920]  They just put on the Academy Awards show
[16:12:49.920 --> 16:12:53.920]  over in France for the G20 meeting.
[16:12:53.920 --> 16:12:56.920]  They got more red carpets rolled out there.
[16:12:56.920 --> 16:12:59.920]  They can roll them from Hollywood to New York.
[16:12:59.920 --> 16:13:01.920]  They have so much red carpet out there.
[16:13:01.920 --> 16:13:06.920]  They have set designers that build these phony multimillion-dollar sets
[16:13:06.920 --> 16:13:10.920]  and the paparazzi, the prostitute paparazzi,
[16:13:10.920 --> 16:13:16.920]  shooting off flashes of the world leaders coming to the stage.
[16:13:16.920 --> 16:13:20.920]  It's like, oh, there's another scam artist, ugly criminal.
[16:13:20.920 --> 16:13:23.920]  Oh, there's another scammer that's owned by this bank
[16:13:23.920 --> 16:13:26.920]  and then they'll shut down all over the world.
[16:13:26.920 --> 16:13:29.920]  One of my reporters got arrested there for no reason
[16:13:29.920 --> 16:13:32.920]  and he's suing them, by the way.
[16:13:32.920 --> 16:13:35.920]  Rob Dew is from the thing that happened in Pittsburgh.
[16:13:35.920 --> 16:13:38.920]  But they shut down whole cities and in Pittsburgh
[16:13:38.920 --> 16:13:42.920]  there's video of old women coming out of a store with bags
[16:13:42.920 --> 16:13:45.920]  and the cops are during the day saying no one on the street
[16:13:45.920 --> 16:13:47.920]  and they just released German shepherds on them.
[16:13:47.920 --> 16:13:50.920]  So it's like the police are the prostitutes too
[16:13:50.920 --> 16:13:53.920]  because when the global bankers show up,
[16:13:53.920 --> 16:13:56.920]  they're like, let's just go beat the hell out of some old women.
[16:13:56.920 --> 16:13:58.920]  Let's show off to the vampire criminals.
[16:13:58.920 --> 16:14:00.920]  Look, I'm going to attack old women
[16:14:00.920 --> 16:14:02.920]  and look, there's a reporter up there on that hill
[16:14:02.920 --> 16:14:05.920]  videotaping us attacking students for no reason in a park.
[16:14:05.920 --> 16:14:08.920]  Let's go arrest the Info Wars reporter.
[16:14:08.920 --> 16:14:11.920]  I mean, it's like a frothing, just like orgy
[16:14:11.920 --> 16:14:15.920]  of beating the hell out of the American people and gang raping us.
[16:14:15.920 --> 16:14:17.920]  It's going on worldwide.
[16:14:17.920 --> 16:14:21.920]  I mean, look what's going on over in Greece again.
[16:14:21.920 --> 16:14:24.920]  You know, I've been talking about direct democracy,
[16:14:24.920 --> 16:14:27.920]  have referendums, let the people vote.
[16:14:27.920 --> 16:14:30.920]  And that's what they were going to do in Greece.
[16:14:30.920 --> 16:14:34.920]  I mean, after all, if you're going to tax the people
[16:14:34.920 --> 16:14:37.920]  as they're losing jobs, cut services,
[16:14:37.920 --> 16:14:40.920]  take their pensions and benefits away from them
[16:14:40.920 --> 16:14:44.920]  and increase the retirement age to laugh after you die,
[16:14:44.920 --> 16:14:46.920]  how about letting the people vote?
[16:14:46.920 --> 16:14:48.920]  Are they going to have a referendum?
[16:14:48.920 --> 16:14:52.920]  Hey, a referendum, they're going to have democracy in Greece.
[16:14:52.920 --> 16:14:57.920]  The cradle of democracy was robbed by the bankers,
[16:14:57.920 --> 16:15:01.920]  the politicians, and the bureaucrats.
[16:15:01.920 --> 16:15:04.920]  They're not going to let the people vote.
[16:15:04.920 --> 16:15:07.920]  Democracy, wake up, children.
[16:15:07.920 --> 16:15:09.920]  It's called fascism.
[16:15:09.920 --> 16:15:12.920]  Let's call a spade a spade.
[16:15:12.920 --> 16:15:17.920]  All these politicians are nothing more
[16:15:17.920 --> 16:15:21.920]  than the front men for the criminal banks
[16:15:21.920 --> 16:15:24.920]  and the businesses, the multinationals
[16:15:24.920 --> 16:15:27.920]  that are grabbing everything.
[16:15:27.920 --> 16:15:30.920]  Who could make this crap up?
[16:15:30.920 --> 16:15:31.920]  I got it.
[16:15:31.920 --> 16:15:33.920]  You lost your job.
[16:15:33.920 --> 16:15:37.920]  Unemployment rate is around 20%.
[16:15:37.920 --> 16:15:39.920]  You're losing your home.
[16:15:39.920 --> 16:15:42.920]  You're being foreclosed on.
[16:15:42.920 --> 16:15:45.920]  You can't make ends meet.
[16:15:45.920 --> 16:15:48.920]  You're almost out on the street.
[16:15:48.920 --> 16:15:51.920]  We're going to raise your taxes.
[16:15:51.920 --> 16:15:54.920]  We're going to cut your services
[16:15:54.920 --> 16:15:57.920]  and every service you pay for, you're going to pay more for.
[16:15:57.920 --> 16:15:59.920]  You know the language, right?
[16:15:59.920 --> 16:16:01.920]  You look as a trend forecaster.
[16:16:01.920 --> 16:16:03.920]  Language is very important.
[16:16:03.920 --> 16:16:07.920]  And they use the term over there in the Europeans
[16:16:07.920 --> 16:16:11.920]  of the Troika, the European Commission,
[16:16:11.920 --> 16:16:15.920]  the European Central Bank,
[16:16:15.920 --> 16:16:20.920]  and the European and the International Monetary Fund.
[16:16:20.920 --> 16:16:23.920]  The Troika is the one, these are the group,
[16:16:23.920 --> 16:16:27.920]  that are coming up with the plans for austerity
[16:16:27.920 --> 16:16:29.920]  for the countries that can't pay their debt.
[16:16:29.920 --> 16:16:33.920]  Troika, how about calling them the crime families?
[16:16:33.920 --> 16:16:37.920]  How about calling them the Lanskis, the Genoveses,
[16:16:37.920 --> 16:16:39.920]  and the Capones?
[16:16:39.920 --> 16:16:40.920]  Could you do that?
[16:16:40.920 --> 16:16:43.920]  Let's stop this Troika crap.
[16:16:43.920 --> 16:16:45.920]  I've said this over and over, Alex,
[16:16:45.920 --> 16:16:47.920]  and I'm going to keep saying it.
[16:16:47.920 --> 16:16:50.920]  If the names on Wall Street were named Salenti,
[16:16:50.920 --> 16:16:53.920]  Caruso, Mandavi, Puccini, Rossini,
[16:16:53.920 --> 16:16:55.920]  they'd call it the Mafia.
[16:16:55.920 --> 16:16:57.920]  Oh, no, but they got nice names over there.
[16:16:57.920 --> 16:17:00.920]  They have Jean-Paul Trichet.
[16:17:00.920 --> 16:17:03.920]  They have Christina Lagarde.
[16:17:03.920 --> 16:17:05.920]  They have fancy names.
[16:17:05.920 --> 16:17:08.920]  These are nothing more than loan sharks.
[16:17:08.920 --> 16:17:10.920]  Hey, Alex, you need some money?
[16:17:10.920 --> 16:17:13.920]  Yeah, you know, don't worry about the fundraiser.
[16:17:13.920 --> 16:17:16.920]  I'll loan you the money.
[16:17:16.920 --> 16:17:18.920]  Yeah, I'll give it to you low interest rates.
[16:17:18.920 --> 16:17:20.920]  Don't worry about it.
[16:17:20.920 --> 16:17:22.920]  And then you can't pay me back.
[16:17:22.920 --> 16:17:23.920]  Gerald, business slowed down.
[16:17:23.920 --> 16:17:24.920]  I can't pay you back.
[16:17:24.920 --> 16:17:27.920]  I want the money.
[16:17:27.920 --> 16:17:29.920]  I can't pay you the money.
[16:17:29.920 --> 16:17:31.920]  I want the money.
[16:17:31.920 --> 16:17:32.920]  Okay.
[16:17:32.920 --> 16:17:34.920]  Now you're going to start cutting the salaries
[16:17:34.920 --> 16:17:36.920]  of all your employees.
[16:17:36.920 --> 16:17:39.920]  And then let's pretend you're a country.
[16:17:39.920 --> 16:17:41.920]  You're going to start taxing everybody
[16:17:41.920 --> 16:17:44.920]  because Salenti wants his money.
[16:17:44.920 --> 16:17:46.920]  And that's not enough.
[16:17:46.920 --> 16:17:48.920]  I don't have enough.
[16:17:48.920 --> 16:17:50.920]  I want your buildings.
[16:17:50.920 --> 16:17:53.920]  I want your water supply.
[16:17:53.920 --> 16:17:56.920]  I want your electric supply.
[16:17:56.920 --> 16:17:59.920]  I want your ports.
[16:17:59.920 --> 16:18:02.920]  We're going to call it privatization.
[16:18:02.920 --> 16:18:04.920]  You're going to tell the people
[16:18:04.920 --> 16:18:07.920]  that you're ruining these enterprises
[16:18:07.920 --> 16:18:10.920]  and you're going to sell them to me really cheap.
[16:18:10.920 --> 16:18:12.920]  You get it, Alex?
[16:18:12.920 --> 16:18:14.920]  That's all this is.
[16:18:14.920 --> 16:18:18.920]  It's one big operation.
[16:18:18.920 --> 16:18:20.920]  They call them banks.
[16:18:20.920 --> 16:18:22.920]  They're loan sharks.
[16:18:22.920 --> 16:18:23.920]  Well, Gerald.
[16:18:23.920 --> 16:18:25.920]  They want their money.
[16:18:25.920 --> 16:18:27.920]  What's even crazier is they didn't even
[16:18:27.920 --> 16:18:29.920]  loan us real money.
[16:18:29.920 --> 16:18:31.920]  They're actually the banks that created the derivatives.
[16:18:31.920 --> 16:18:33.920]  They get bailed out with our money
[16:18:33.920 --> 16:18:35.920]  and then we pay taxes and interest
[16:18:35.920 --> 16:18:37.920]  on the money we give them.
[16:18:37.920 --> 16:18:39.920]  And I was reading in Illinois,
[16:18:39.920 --> 16:18:41.920]  they admit the housing market is completely dead.
[16:18:41.920 --> 16:18:43.920]  There's a triple debt.
[16:18:43.920 --> 16:18:45.920]  It's one of the worst in the country.
[16:18:45.920 --> 16:18:47.920]  And they announced we're raising your property taxes
[16:18:47.920 --> 16:18:49.920]  across the board and they actually said,
[16:18:49.920 --> 16:18:51.920]  look, we'll just take your house.
[16:18:51.920 --> 16:18:53.920]  We don't care if you're 85 years old.
[16:18:53.920 --> 16:18:55.920]  We'll murder you if you don't come out.
[16:18:55.920 --> 16:18:57.920]  So, I mean,
[16:18:57.920 --> 16:18:59.920]  going back to the Italian mafia,
[16:18:59.920 --> 16:19:01.920]  other organized crime I've seen,
[16:19:01.920 --> 16:19:03.920]  they're not even that hardcore with old people.
[16:19:03.920 --> 16:19:05.920]  And you're right.
[16:19:05.920 --> 16:19:07.920]  It's always little criminal bankers with red carpets
[16:19:07.920 --> 16:19:09.920]  and we just have to sit there while they gang rape us.
[16:19:09.920 --> 16:19:11.920]  But is there no end to what
[16:19:11.920 --> 16:19:13.920]  they'll get away with, Gerald?
[16:19:13.920 --> 16:19:15.920]  Well, you can see what's going on
[16:19:15.920 --> 16:19:17.920]  and that's what all of these protests,
[16:19:17.920 --> 16:19:19.920]  these Occupy movements.
[16:19:19.920 --> 16:19:21.920]  By the way, we were down
[16:19:21.920 --> 16:19:23.920]  on the Occupy scene.
[16:19:23.920 --> 16:19:25.920]  We have somebody down there virtually every day.
[16:19:25.920 --> 16:19:27.920]  But when I went down,
[16:19:27.920 --> 16:19:29.920]  there were a number of people came up to me
[16:19:29.920 --> 16:19:31.920]  and they asked,
[16:19:31.920 --> 16:19:33.920]  they said how they love your show
[16:19:33.920 --> 16:19:35.920]  and seeing me on your show
[16:19:35.920 --> 16:19:37.920]  and they were asking that you go there.
[16:19:37.920 --> 16:19:39.920]  So, I just want to let you know
[16:19:39.920 --> 16:19:41.920]  that you have a lot of fans out there
[16:19:41.920 --> 16:19:43.920]  on the Occupy Wall Street New York scene.
[16:19:43.920 --> 16:19:45.920]  And that's what you're seeing,
[16:19:45.920 --> 16:19:47.920]  this Occupy movement.
[16:19:47.920 --> 16:19:49.920]  It's bigger than that.
[16:19:49.920 --> 16:19:51.920]  We're talking about this.
[16:19:51.920 --> 16:19:53.920]  Go back to last December.
[16:19:53.920 --> 16:19:55.920]  You started seeing riots
[16:19:55.920 --> 16:19:57.920]  in Tunisia.
[16:19:57.920 --> 16:19:59.920]  What did the prostitutes say?
[16:19:59.920 --> 16:20:01.920]  I'll tell you who them rioters are.
[16:20:01.920 --> 16:20:03.920]  Them is Islamofascist,
[16:20:03.920 --> 16:20:05.920]  they told us.
[16:20:05.920 --> 16:20:07.920]  Then you saw the riots breaking out
[16:20:07.920 --> 16:20:09.920]  in Egypt.
[16:20:09.920 --> 16:20:11.920]  It's them Muslim brotherhoods.
[16:20:11.920 --> 16:20:13.920]  And then they happened in Bahrain.
[16:20:13.920 --> 16:20:15.920]  It's them Iranians
[16:20:15.920 --> 16:20:17.920]  that are behind all this
[16:20:17.920 --> 16:20:19.920]  on razz.
[16:20:19.920 --> 16:20:21.920]  And then it happens in Yemen.
[16:20:21.920 --> 16:20:23.920]  These are people that want to stop
[16:20:23.920 --> 16:20:25.920]  our guy over there,
[16:20:25.920 --> 16:20:27.920]  who's helping us in the war on terror.
[16:20:27.920 --> 16:20:29.920]  They're al-Qaeda people.
[16:20:29.920 --> 16:20:31.920]  And then it happens over
[16:20:31.920 --> 16:20:33.920]  in the UK this summer.
[16:20:33.920 --> 16:20:35.920]  Them people's out in the street
[16:20:35.920 --> 16:20:37.920]  of hooligans, they says.
[16:20:37.920 --> 16:20:39.920]  And then it happens over in Greece.
[16:20:39.920 --> 16:20:41.920]  You know what them Greeks are?
[16:20:41.920 --> 16:20:43.920]  Those are anarchists.
[16:20:43.920 --> 16:20:45.920]  We've said it from the beginning.
[16:20:45.920 --> 16:20:47.920]  Go back to the
[16:20:47.920 --> 16:20:49.920]  Autumn Trends Journal of
[16:20:49.920 --> 16:20:51.920]  2010.
[16:20:51.920 --> 16:20:53.920]  Off with their heads,
[16:20:53.920 --> 16:20:55.920]  2.0 was the headline.
[16:20:55.920 --> 16:20:57.920]  When the money stops
[16:20:57.920 --> 16:20:59.920]  flowing down to the man on the street,
[16:20:59.920 --> 16:21:01.920]  the blood starts flowing
[16:21:01.920 --> 16:21:03.920]  in the streets.
[16:21:03.920 --> 16:21:05.920]  That's what's going on now.
[16:21:05.920 --> 16:21:07.920]  It's all connected.
[16:21:07.920 --> 16:21:09.920]  There are riots that are
[16:21:09.920 --> 16:21:11.920]  going on around the world.
[16:21:11.920 --> 16:21:13.920]  You have, this isn't
[16:21:13.920 --> 16:21:15.920]  the old feudalism
[16:21:15.920 --> 16:21:17.920]  where we had the aristocracy
[16:21:17.920 --> 16:21:19.920]  and a bunch of us
[16:21:19.920 --> 16:21:21.920]  dumb peasants.
[16:21:21.920 --> 16:21:23.920]  Now we're educated
[16:21:23.920 --> 16:21:25.920]  and we know the score.
[16:21:25.920 --> 16:21:27.920]  Everybody at
[16:21:27.920 --> 16:21:29.920]  the top of the pyramid got all the
[16:21:29.920 --> 16:21:31.920]  dough and you have
[16:21:31.920 --> 16:21:33.920]  nothing.
[16:21:33.920 --> 16:21:35.920]  And you have all of these college students
[16:21:35.920 --> 16:21:37.920]  holding university degrees
[16:21:37.920 --> 16:21:39.920]  and worthlessness
[16:21:39.920 --> 16:21:41.920]  that know what the story is.
[16:21:41.920 --> 16:21:43.920]  They've become indentured servants.
[16:21:43.920 --> 16:21:45.920]  On average,
[16:21:45.920 --> 16:21:47.920]  on average,
[16:21:47.920 --> 16:21:49.920]  student debt
[16:21:49.920 --> 16:21:51.920]  is $25,000.
[16:21:51.920 --> 16:21:53.920]  The student
[16:21:53.920 --> 16:21:55.920]  debt burden
[16:21:55.920 --> 16:21:57.920]  in the United States alone
[16:21:57.920 --> 16:21:59.920]  is greater than
[16:21:59.920 --> 16:22:01.920]  all the credit card debt
[16:22:01.920 --> 16:22:03.920]  that everybody has
[16:22:03.920 --> 16:22:05.920]  accumulating.
[16:22:05.920 --> 16:22:07.920]  So what you're seeing,
[16:22:07.920 --> 16:22:09.920]  young people with no future in front
[16:22:09.920 --> 16:22:11.920]  the unemployed,
[16:22:11.920 --> 16:22:13.920]  the unemployable,
[16:22:13.920 --> 16:22:15.920]  the very angry
[16:22:15.920 --> 16:22:17.920]  and it's worldwide.
[16:22:17.920 --> 16:22:19.920]  They know they have no future
[16:22:19.920 --> 16:22:21.920]  and you have a bunch of
[16:22:21.920 --> 16:22:23.920]  money junkies at the top
[16:22:23.920 --> 16:22:25.920]  that want it all.
[16:22:25.920 --> 16:22:27.920]  And again, when you look what's going on
[16:22:27.920 --> 16:22:29.920]  in Greece, it cannot
[16:22:29.920 --> 16:22:31.920]  be a better
[16:22:31.920 --> 16:22:33.920]  analogy, a better
[16:22:33.920 --> 16:22:35.920]  a better
[16:22:35.920 --> 16:22:37.920]  showing of the loss of
[16:22:37.920 --> 16:22:39.920]  democracy.
[16:22:39.920 --> 16:22:41.920]  When here you have the cradle of
[16:22:41.920 --> 16:22:43.920]  democracy, as I said
[16:22:43.920 --> 16:22:45.920]  being robbed
[16:22:45.920 --> 16:22:47.920]  by the bankers,
[16:22:47.920 --> 16:22:49.920]  the politicians and the bureaucrats
[16:22:49.920 --> 16:22:51.920]  telling the people
[16:22:51.920 --> 16:22:53.920]  you're not going to vote on this.
[16:22:53.920 --> 16:22:55.920]  Our boys already
[16:22:55.920 --> 16:22:57.920]  voted.
[16:22:57.920 --> 16:22:59.920]  So that's what's going on.
[16:22:59.920 --> 16:23:01.920]  Again, fascism
[16:23:01.920 --> 16:23:03.920]  is running wild.
[16:23:03.920 --> 16:23:05.920]  Well that was my next question.
[16:23:05.920 --> 16:23:07.920]  I heard
[16:23:07.920 --> 16:23:09.920]  Bloomberg on XM
[16:23:09.920 --> 16:23:11.920]  CNBC
[16:23:11.920 --> 16:23:13.920]  in the last month talking about Europe
[16:23:13.920 --> 16:23:15.920]  and they're like it's terrible if the Germans vote
[16:23:15.920 --> 16:23:17.920]  to not create this new economic union
[16:23:17.920 --> 16:23:19.920]  and the Vatican's calling for
[16:23:19.920 --> 16:23:21.920]  world government and all this, but
[16:23:21.920 --> 16:23:23.920]  it's terrible that people might actually vote out of this
[16:23:23.920 --> 16:23:25.920]  and I've actually heard on multiple channels
[16:23:25.920 --> 16:23:27.920]  go don't worry, we'll get it one way or the other.
[16:23:27.920 --> 16:23:29.920]  I mean
[16:23:29.920 --> 16:23:31.920]  it's just they're open crooks now
[16:23:31.920 --> 16:23:33.920]  everywhere, literally rubbing
[16:23:33.920 --> 16:23:35.920]  their hands together about how we're their slaves
[16:23:35.920 --> 16:23:37.920]  in public.
[16:23:37.920 --> 16:23:39.920]  I watched this guy Larry
[16:23:39.920 --> 16:23:41.920]  Kudlow on CNBC.
[16:23:41.920 --> 16:23:43.920]  I could take a couple of minutes of these shows.
[16:23:43.920 --> 16:23:45.920]  You know I'm all in favor
[16:23:45.920 --> 16:23:47.920]  of democracy, he says.
[16:23:47.920 --> 16:23:49.920]  Oh great, glad to hear
[16:23:49.920 --> 16:23:51.920]  that Larry.
[16:23:51.920 --> 16:23:53.920]  But you know this is no time for
[16:23:53.920 --> 16:23:55.920]  them Greek people to vote.
[16:23:55.920 --> 16:23:57.920]  Oh yeah?
[16:23:57.920 --> 16:23:59.920]  Who are these people that keep telling us what
[16:23:59.920 --> 16:24:01.920]  we should do? Like listening to that guy
[16:24:01.920 --> 16:24:03.920]  Eric Kitty Cantor over there
[16:24:03.920 --> 16:24:05.920]  and Boner
[16:24:05.920 --> 16:24:07.920]  the guy from
[16:24:07.920 --> 16:24:09.920]  the GOP leader
[16:24:09.920 --> 16:24:11.920]  in their house. You know
[16:24:11.920 --> 16:24:13.920]  and the pizza king over there
[16:24:13.920 --> 16:24:15.920]  Cain running
[16:24:15.920 --> 16:24:17.920]  for president. You know
[16:24:17.920 --> 16:24:19.920]  if the people want a protest
[16:24:19.920 --> 16:24:21.920]  they should go to Washington.
[16:24:21.920 --> 16:24:23.920]  Who are you to tell people
[16:24:23.920 --> 16:24:25.920]  what they should do?
[16:24:25.920 --> 16:24:27.920]  Where do these politicians come off
[16:24:27.920 --> 16:24:29.920]  telling us what
[16:24:29.920 --> 16:24:31.920]  we should do? And that's what's
[16:24:31.920 --> 16:24:33.920]  going on now.
[16:24:33.920 --> 16:24:35.920]  You're seeing the beginning
[16:24:35.920 --> 16:24:37.920]  of the first great
[16:24:37.920 --> 16:24:39.920]  war of the 21st
[16:24:39.920 --> 16:24:41.920]  century. It's underway.
[16:24:41.920 --> 16:24:43.920]  END IT UP
[16:24:43.920 --> 16:24:45.920]  END IT UP
[16:24:45.920 --> 16:24:47.920]  Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain
[16:24:47.920 --> 16:24:49.920]  Morocco, Syria, Libya
[16:24:49.920 --> 16:24:51.920]  riots in
[16:24:51.920 --> 16:24:53.920]  Greece, riots in the UK
[16:24:53.920 --> 16:24:55.920]  riots in Italy
[16:24:55.920 --> 16:24:57.920]  strikes everywhere
[16:24:57.920 --> 16:24:59.920]  occupy movements
[16:24:59.920 --> 16:25:01.920]  in 80
[16:25:01.920 --> 16:25:03.920]  countries
[16:25:03.920 --> 16:25:05.920]  in 1117
[16:25:05.920 --> 16:25:07.920]  cities
[16:25:07.920 --> 16:25:09.920]  the people
[16:25:09.920 --> 16:25:11.920]  are angry
[16:25:11.920 --> 16:25:13.920]  it's running out of control
[16:25:13.920 --> 16:25:15.920]  and unfortunately
[16:25:15.920 --> 16:25:17.920]  there are a group
[16:25:17.920 --> 16:25:19.920]  of police
[16:25:19.920 --> 16:25:21.920]  that have become nothing
[16:25:21.920 --> 16:25:23.920]  more than
[16:25:23.920 --> 16:25:25.920]  enforces
[16:25:25.920 --> 16:25:27.920]  for the political
[16:25:27.920 --> 16:25:29.920]  and financial
[16:25:29.920 --> 16:25:31.920]  crime bosses
[16:25:31.920 --> 16:25:33.920]  so you're going to
[16:25:33.920 --> 16:25:35.920]  see a war
[16:25:35.920 --> 16:25:37.920]  break out and it's
[16:25:37.920 --> 16:25:39.920]  happening now and what we're saying
[16:25:39.920 --> 16:25:41.920]  is that violence is
[16:25:41.920 --> 16:25:43.920]  not going to work. They're going to win, they're going to
[16:25:43.920 --> 16:25:45.920]  outpower you. This has
[16:25:45.920 --> 16:25:47.920]  to be an intellectual revolution
[16:25:47.920 --> 16:25:49.920]  and I keep saying oh and again
[16:25:49.920 --> 16:25:51.920]  look how they
[16:25:51.920 --> 16:25:53.920]  freaked out when
[16:25:53.920 --> 16:25:55.920]  and that's why the stock market went up
[16:25:55.920 --> 16:25:57.920]  yesterday. The good news
[16:25:57.920 --> 16:25:59.920]  that the Greek people would not
[16:25:59.920 --> 16:26:01.920]  have a say in
[16:26:01.920 --> 16:26:03.920]  the austerity measures
[16:26:03.920 --> 16:26:05.920]  so what we're saying
[16:26:05.920 --> 16:26:07.920]  let the people vote.
[16:26:07.920 --> 16:26:09.920]  I also hear this cliche
[16:26:09.920 --> 16:26:11.920]  that well the Greeks they're all lazy
[16:26:11.920 --> 16:26:13.920]  which is just pure baloney
[16:26:13.920 --> 16:26:15.920]  or again
[16:26:15.920 --> 16:26:17.920]  the system tries to co-opt
[16:26:17.920 --> 16:26:19.920]  Occupy Wall Street so can then legitimately
[16:26:19.920 --> 16:26:21.920]  be criticized as some elements of it
[16:26:21.920 --> 16:26:23.920]  being collectivist or whatever
[16:26:23.920 --> 16:26:25.920]  but overall it's just people that are upset about
[16:26:25.920 --> 16:26:27.920]  Wall Street taking over Washington
[16:26:27.920 --> 16:26:29.920]  inducing Washington to give them tens
[16:26:29.920 --> 16:26:31.920]  of trillions of our tax money
[16:26:31.920 --> 16:26:33.920]  and then all these fake conservatives get up
[16:26:33.920 --> 16:26:35.920]  and criticize anybody
[16:26:35.920 --> 16:26:37.920]  who wants to shut down the corruption
[16:26:37.920 --> 16:26:39.920]  Wall Street as communists when it's
[16:26:39.920 --> 16:26:41.920]  the opposite and
[16:26:41.920 --> 16:26:43.920]  then there's this whole let them eat
[16:26:43.920 --> 16:26:45.920]  cake attitude Gerald
[16:26:45.920 --> 16:26:47.920]  and it just gets crazier
[16:26:47.920 --> 16:26:49.920]  and crazier and crazier
[16:26:49.920 --> 16:26:51.920]  by the minute. How far
[16:26:51.920 --> 16:26:53.920]  can this go?
[16:26:53.920 --> 16:26:55.920]  Because you say that
[16:26:55.920 --> 16:26:57.920]  the system would win
[16:26:57.920 --> 16:26:59.920]  at least in large
[16:26:59.920 --> 16:27:01.920]  confrontations of violence but
[16:27:01.920 --> 16:27:03.920]  sometimes like Chilchescu
[16:27:05.920 --> 16:27:07.920]  they do want atrocity too far
[16:27:07.920 --> 16:27:09.920]  they beat up too many crowds
[16:27:09.920 --> 16:27:11.920]  the police and military
[16:27:13.920 --> 16:27:15.920]  see what their country is being turned into
[16:27:15.920 --> 16:27:17.920]  and turn against them. I'm not saying that that's
[16:27:17.920 --> 16:27:19.920]  coming
[16:27:19.920 --> 16:27:21.920]  but as this becomes more and more naked
[16:27:21.920 --> 16:27:23.920]  as the system openly pushes
[16:27:23.920 --> 16:27:25.920]  tyranny and
[16:27:25.920 --> 16:27:27.920]  and in tyrannizing the public
[16:27:27.920 --> 16:27:29.920]  there's just going to be a lot of people
[16:27:29.920 --> 16:27:31.920]  who don't comply, who don't go along
[16:27:31.920 --> 16:27:33.920]  who refuse to
[16:27:33.920 --> 16:27:35.920]  serve
[16:27:35.920 --> 16:27:37.920]  government bureaucrats
[16:27:37.920 --> 16:27:39.920]  you know Ventura had his suit thrown out
[16:27:39.920 --> 16:27:41.920]  you don't even get a day in court
[16:27:41.920 --> 16:27:43.920]  federal courts don't have the place to talk about
[16:27:43.920 --> 16:27:45.920]  the federal power grab
[16:27:45.920 --> 16:27:47.920]  the TSA is now
[16:27:47.920 --> 16:27:49.920]  setting up checkpoints on the highways
[16:27:49.920 --> 16:27:51.920]  they've got a FEMA takeover drill
[16:27:51.920 --> 16:27:53.920]  coming up in just five days
[16:27:53.920 --> 16:27:55.920]  of all communications
[16:27:55.920 --> 16:27:57.920]  they're announcing microphones to be on the street lights
[16:27:57.920 --> 16:27:59.920]  listening to us
[16:27:59.920 --> 16:28:01.920]  it's like a hallucination
[16:28:01.920 --> 16:28:03.920]  it's one thing to intellectually know
[16:28:03.920 --> 16:28:05.920]  all this is coming but as it arrives
[16:28:05.920 --> 16:28:07.920]  Gerald it's just like
[16:28:07.920 --> 16:28:09.920]  it's already this crazy
[16:28:09.920 --> 16:28:11.920]  how much more science
[16:28:11.920 --> 16:28:13.920]  fiction is this going to get?
[16:28:13.920 --> 16:28:15.920]  you have psychopaths
[16:28:15.920 --> 16:28:17.920]  and sociopaths in charge
[16:28:17.920 --> 16:28:19.920]  I mean look at them
[16:28:19.920 --> 16:28:21.920]  just roll off the names
[16:28:21.920 --> 16:28:23.920]  look at the faces
[16:28:23.920 --> 16:28:25.920]  Sarkozy, Cameron
[16:28:25.920 --> 16:28:27.920]  two little tough boys that start wars
[16:28:27.920 --> 16:28:29.920]  they've probably never been in a schoolyard fight
[16:28:31.920 --> 16:28:33.920]  but they were willing to send other people
[16:28:33.920 --> 16:28:35.920]  to go fight and bleed and die
[16:28:35.920 --> 16:28:37.920]  and kill
[16:28:37.920 --> 16:28:39.920]  thousands of people
[16:28:39.920 --> 16:28:41.920]  so they have no conscious
[16:28:41.920 --> 16:28:43.920]  look what's going on
[16:28:43.920 --> 16:28:45.920]  with the wars in Afghanistan
[16:28:45.920 --> 16:28:47.920]  ten years and they roll out these boy scouts
[16:28:47.920 --> 16:28:49.920]  like Petraeus
[16:28:49.920 --> 16:28:51.920]  as they call them in the New York Times
[16:28:51.920 --> 16:28:53.920]  a boy scout charm
[16:28:53.920 --> 16:28:55.920]  oh wonderful
[16:28:55.920 --> 16:28:57.920]  remember this cat said that
[16:28:57.920 --> 16:28:59.920]  we're making impressive progress over there
[16:28:59.920 --> 16:29:01.920]  now they're making the head of the CIA
[16:29:01.920 --> 16:29:03.920]  that was going off for ten years
[16:29:03.920 --> 16:29:05.920]  how many tens of thousands of people killed
[16:29:05.920 --> 16:29:07.920]  both on their side
[16:29:07.920 --> 16:29:09.920]  and all the wounded people
[16:29:09.920 --> 16:29:11.920]  and dead from our side
[16:29:11.920 --> 16:29:13.920]  how about that wonderful Iraq war
[16:29:13.920 --> 16:29:15.920]  oh you remember Alex
[16:29:15.920 --> 16:29:17.920]  he had weapons of mass destruction
[16:29:17.920 --> 16:29:19.920]  and thies to Al Qaeda over there
[16:29:19.920 --> 16:29:21.920]  we ruined the entire country
[16:29:21.920 --> 16:29:23.920]  depleted uranium everywhere
[16:29:23.920 --> 16:29:25.920]  they estimate a million people dead
[16:29:25.920 --> 16:29:27.920]  trillions of dollars
[16:29:27.920 --> 16:29:29.920]  of our money spent
[16:29:29.920 --> 16:29:31.920]  oh we're going to get out of here don't worry about it
[16:29:31.920 --> 16:29:33.920]  and now they're building up forces
[16:29:33.920 --> 16:29:35.920]  over other places in the Middle East
[16:29:35.920 --> 16:29:37.920]  you have people that are out of their mind
[16:29:37.920 --> 16:29:39.920]  that are running the show
[16:29:39.920 --> 16:29:41.920]  and I keep saying it over and over
[16:29:41.920 --> 16:29:43.920]  let's make it really simple
[16:29:43.920 --> 16:29:45.920]  the same people that are the politicians
[16:29:45.920 --> 16:29:47.920]  and the top bureaucrats
[16:29:47.920 --> 16:29:49.920]  are the same people that you hated
[16:29:49.920 --> 16:29:51.920]  in high school and college
[16:29:51.920 --> 16:29:53.920]  that wanted to be class president
[16:29:53.920 --> 16:29:55.920]  and head of the student council
[16:29:55.920 --> 16:29:57.920]  that's all they are
[16:29:57.920 --> 16:29:59.920]  the suck ups, the brown noses, the glad handers
[16:29:59.920 --> 16:30:01.920]  the insincere, the overly ambitious
[16:30:01.920 --> 16:30:03.920]  and the outright liars
[16:30:03.920 --> 16:30:05.920]  now they're telling us what to do
[16:30:05.920 --> 16:30:07.920]  are you going to watch them
[16:30:07.920 --> 16:30:10.920]  wait online as the modicade goes by?
[16:30:10.920 --> 16:30:12.920]  well now you're going to watch
[16:30:12.920 --> 16:30:14.920]  as they're hired enforcers
[16:30:14.920 --> 16:30:16.920]  grab your wife's breast
[16:30:16.920 --> 16:30:18.920]  fondle your three year olds genitals
[16:30:18.920 --> 16:30:20.920]  and bark at you
[16:30:20.920 --> 16:30:22.920]  I mean there's only so much
[16:30:22.920 --> 16:30:24.920]  and I guess they think we're so
[16:30:24.920 --> 16:30:26.920]  broke back that we're just going to submit to them
[16:30:26.920 --> 16:30:28.920]  and you bring up mafia
[16:30:28.920 --> 16:30:30.920]  we always knew the CIA
[16:30:30.920 --> 16:30:32.920]  was bringing in drugs
[16:30:32.920 --> 16:30:34.920]  500 billion a year industry
[16:30:34.920 --> 16:30:36.920]  now they just have Geraldo
[16:30:36.920 --> 16:30:38.920]  get up there with his
[16:30:38.920 --> 16:30:40.920]  stromboli mustache
[16:30:40.920 --> 16:30:42.920]  and he just gets up there
[16:30:42.920 --> 16:30:44.920]  and tells us hey
[16:30:44.920 --> 16:30:46.920]  the marines are growing the opium
[16:30:46.920 --> 16:30:48.920]  because that's how we fight Al-Qaeda
[16:30:48.920 --> 16:30:50.920]  and we ship it into your kids
[16:30:50.920 --> 16:30:52.920]  and there's this disconnect
[16:30:52.920 --> 16:30:54.920]  I've talked to military people and they're like
[16:30:54.920 --> 16:30:56.920]  well yeah we are over there
[16:30:56.920 --> 16:30:58.920]  we do grow it, it goes on the planes
[16:30:58.920 --> 16:31:00.920]  and I guess it goes to America
[16:31:00.920 --> 16:31:02.920]  but if you get caught with that
[16:31:02.920 --> 16:31:04.920]  there's a barbecuing children
[16:31:04.920 --> 16:31:06.920]  on the White House lawn
[16:31:06.920 --> 16:31:08.920]  I mean will it be like Planet of the Apes
[16:31:08.920 --> 16:31:10.920]  where they just ride us down for fun
[16:31:10.920 --> 16:31:12.920]  I guess they already do
[16:31:12.920 --> 16:31:14.920]  if you try to protest
[16:31:14.920 --> 16:31:16.920]  I mean it's just like this government
[16:31:16.920 --> 16:31:18.920]  is literally out in the open
[16:31:18.920 --> 16:31:20.920]  it's everywhere
[16:31:20.920 --> 16:31:22.920]  they're doing it everywhere
[16:31:22.920 --> 16:31:24.920]  look at the cops beating up people
[16:31:24.920 --> 16:31:26.920]  all over the world
[16:31:26.920 --> 16:31:28.920]  and there's nothing more again
[16:31:28.920 --> 16:31:30.920]  than enforcers for crime bosses
[16:31:30.920 --> 16:31:32.920]  aren't bad
[16:31:32.920 --> 16:31:34.920]  up here in Kingston New York they're terrific
[16:31:34.920 --> 16:31:36.920]  they don't bother you for a little crap
[16:31:36.920 --> 16:31:38.920]  they're five blocks away
[16:31:38.920 --> 16:31:40.920]  they're lousy neighborhoods
[16:31:40.920 --> 16:31:42.920]  they're drugs the whole scene going on
[16:31:42.920 --> 16:31:44.920]  that's what they're putting their attention on
[16:31:44.920 --> 16:31:46.920]  what's happening though
[16:31:46.920 --> 16:31:48.920]  is they want to keep the people under control
[16:31:48.920 --> 16:31:50.920]  you mentioned about what happened
[16:31:50.920 --> 16:31:52.920]  during the breakup of the Soviet Union
[16:31:52.920 --> 16:31:54.920]  and how the people took to the streets
[16:31:54.920 --> 16:31:56.920]  what happens though
[16:31:56.920 --> 16:31:58.920]  is one group of criminals comes in
[16:31:58.920 --> 16:32:00.920]  and takes over for the other group
[16:32:00.920 --> 16:32:02.920]  it has to be in the hands of the people
[16:32:02.920 --> 16:32:04.920]  if we're going to call this democracies
[16:32:04.920 --> 16:32:06.920]  let the people vote
[16:32:06.920 --> 16:32:08.920]  and that's why we're starting
[16:32:08.920 --> 16:32:12.920]  the movement directdemocracynow.org
[16:32:12.920 --> 16:32:14.920]  let's make the people vote
[16:32:14.920 --> 16:32:16.920]  on critical issues you want to TSA
[16:32:16.920 --> 16:32:18.920]  let the people vote
[16:32:18.920 --> 16:32:20.920]  you want to continue the war on drugs
[16:32:20.920 --> 16:32:22.920]  let the people vote
[16:32:22.920 --> 16:32:24.920]  you want to start another war or end wars
[16:32:24.920 --> 16:32:26.920]  let the people vote
[16:32:26.920 --> 16:32:28.920]  you want to continue the patriot act
[16:32:28.920 --> 16:32:30.920]  let the people vote
[16:32:30.920 --> 16:32:32.920]  we don't need a gang of 535
[16:32:32.920 --> 16:32:34.920]  senators and congressmen
[16:32:34.920 --> 16:32:36.920]  telling 312 million people
[16:32:36.920 --> 16:32:38.920]  how to tie their shoes
[16:32:42.920 --> 16:32:44.920]  Gerald when you talk about
[16:32:44.920 --> 16:32:46.920]  where do you
[16:32:46.920 --> 16:32:48.920]  I mean I know you like to calculate everything
[16:32:48.920 --> 16:32:50.920]  and then write the journal and be real careful about it
[16:32:50.920 --> 16:32:52.920]  and you predicted the whole movement
[16:32:52.920 --> 16:32:54.920]  we're now seeing
[16:32:54.920 --> 16:32:56.920]  the tea parties all of it
[16:32:56.920 --> 16:32:58.920]  but looking forward into the future
[16:32:58.920 --> 16:33:00.920]  this something's got to give
[16:33:00.920 --> 16:33:02.920]  I mean the establishment's got to know
[16:33:02.920 --> 16:33:04.920]  that all this police state garbage
[16:33:04.920 --> 16:33:06.920]  is not actually breaking the will
[16:33:06.920 --> 16:33:08.920]  of the average person
[16:33:08.920 --> 16:33:10.920]  the people I know are angry
[16:33:10.920 --> 16:33:12.920]  I mean I'm in an airport line now
[16:33:12.920 --> 16:33:14.920]  women men they're all talking trash about the government
[16:33:14.920 --> 16:33:16.920]  they know it's a bunch of bull
[16:33:16.920 --> 16:33:18.920]  I talked to reporters that are told to go out
[16:33:18.920 --> 16:33:20.920]  and do a positive story about the TSA
[16:33:20.920 --> 16:33:22.920]  they've got to interview 40 plus people
[16:33:22.920 --> 16:33:24.920]  in person that likes it
[16:33:24.920 --> 16:33:26.920]  then that goes on the news
[16:33:26.920 --> 16:33:28.920]  the newsrooms are all hating the system
[16:33:28.920 --> 16:33:30.920]  I mean
[16:33:30.920 --> 16:33:32.920]  it's like we're
[16:33:32.920 --> 16:33:34.920]  people out there
[16:33:34.920 --> 16:33:36.920]  are waking up but still
[16:33:36.920 --> 16:33:38.920]  so many people in the system
[16:33:38.920 --> 16:33:40.920]  are still playing along with it
[16:33:40.920 --> 16:33:42.920]  but more and more they're just reaches a point
[16:33:42.920 --> 16:33:44.920]  where people don't care anymore
[16:33:44.920 --> 16:33:46.920]  and I think that's the real Achilles heel
[16:33:46.920 --> 16:33:48.920]  historically but also currently
[16:33:48.920 --> 16:33:50.920]  these ruling elites think
[16:33:50.920 --> 16:33:52.920]  they're the anthropologists, the sociologists
[16:33:52.920 --> 16:33:54.920]  the psychologists
[16:33:54.920 --> 16:33:56.920]  and they think they're in control
[16:33:56.920 --> 16:33:58.920]  but I mean they are not in control
[16:33:58.920 --> 16:34:00.920]  and I agree with you
[16:34:00.920 --> 16:34:02.920]  I'm concerned about
[16:34:02.920 --> 16:34:04.920]  an out of control revolution in this country
[16:34:04.920 --> 16:34:06.920]  and then something as bad or worse comes in
[16:34:06.920 --> 16:34:08.920]  on the back of it because
[16:34:08.920 --> 16:34:10.920]  I mean let me tell you
[16:34:10.920 --> 16:34:12.920]  there are a lot of people
[16:34:12.920 --> 16:34:14.920]  I mean here's an example they're devaluing the currency
[16:34:14.920 --> 16:34:16.920]  there's all these veterans they're telling them
[16:34:16.920 --> 16:34:18.920]  get ready people that spent 20 years in
[16:34:18.920 --> 16:34:20.920]  half and there's all these old vets
[16:34:20.920 --> 16:34:22.920]  a lot of them you know who have health
[16:34:22.920 --> 16:34:24.920]  problems whatever
[16:34:24.920 --> 16:34:26.920]  who are just waiting
[16:34:26.920 --> 16:34:28.920]  waiting to go
[16:34:28.920 --> 16:34:30.920]  crazy and start attacking the government
[16:34:30.920 --> 16:34:32.920]  this isn't going to be some fake terrorist thing
[16:34:32.920 --> 16:34:34.920]  this is going to be the real deal
[16:34:34.920 --> 16:34:36.920]  I mean I don't think the system realizes
[16:34:36.920 --> 16:34:38.920]  I guess they do in their own memos they say
[16:34:38.920 --> 16:34:40.920]  veterans are the most dangerous thing
[16:34:40.920 --> 16:34:42.920]  well it's true I mean at a certain point
[16:34:42.920 --> 16:34:44.920]  they're going to keep smacking people around
[16:34:44.920 --> 16:34:46.920]  and there's a lot of people you know the system
[16:34:46.920 --> 16:34:48.920]  has taken the populations
[16:34:48.920 --> 16:34:50.920]  restraint as a sign of weakness
[16:34:50.920 --> 16:34:52.920]  and it's not that good nice friendly people
[16:34:52.920 --> 16:34:54.920]  are extremely violent inside
[16:34:54.920 --> 16:34:56.920]  much more than evil people
[16:34:56.920 --> 16:34:58.920]  anybody who's been around knows that
[16:34:58.920 --> 16:35:00.920]  and it's restraint but once it starts
[16:35:00.920 --> 16:35:02.920]  once good people get violent
[16:35:02.920 --> 16:35:04.920]  it's not pretty Gerald as you know
[16:35:04.920 --> 16:35:06.920]  can you speak to that
[16:35:06.920 --> 16:35:08.920]  I think on the first point
[16:35:08.920 --> 16:35:10.920]  do the people
[16:35:10.920 --> 16:35:12.920]  at the top know what's going on
[16:35:12.920 --> 16:35:14.920]  down at the bottom
[16:35:14.920 --> 16:35:16.920]  to an extent they do
[16:35:16.920 --> 16:35:18.920]  they're very worried but again
[16:35:18.920 --> 16:35:20.920]  look at that show they just put on
[16:35:20.920 --> 16:35:22.920]  and are putting on
[16:35:22.920 --> 16:35:24.920]  at the G20 meeting
[16:35:24.920 --> 16:35:26.920]  again it makes the Academy Awards
[16:35:26.920 --> 16:35:28.920]  Oscar night look like you know small time
[16:35:28.920 --> 16:35:30.920]  and it's a perfect
[16:35:30.920 --> 16:35:32.920]  let them eat cake moment
[16:35:32.920 --> 16:35:34.920]  when you see how out of touch they are
[16:35:34.920 --> 16:35:36.920]  you know I mentioned
[16:35:36.920 --> 16:35:38.920]  I may have mentioned on your show
[16:35:38.920 --> 16:35:40.920]  when I began my career I used to run
[16:35:40.920 --> 16:35:42.920]  political campaigns in Westchester County
[16:35:42.920 --> 16:35:44.920]  in New York
[16:35:44.920 --> 16:35:46.920]  and then they sent me up to Albany
[16:35:46.920 --> 16:35:48.920]  and I was the assistant to the secretary
[16:35:48.920 --> 16:35:50.920]  of the New York State Senate
[16:35:50.920 --> 16:35:52.920]  so I got to see things first hand
[16:35:52.920 --> 16:35:54.920]  and it was the worst job I ever had
[16:35:54.920 --> 16:35:56.920]  I'd be hanging out in the back
[16:35:56.920 --> 16:35:58.920]  of the Senate chamber with my buddy
[16:35:58.920 --> 16:36:00.920]  you know I'm shit chatting about this or that
[16:36:00.920 --> 16:36:02.920]  you know I was a young guy in my 20s
[16:36:02.920 --> 16:36:04.920]  and all of a sudden
[16:36:04.920 --> 16:36:06.920]  the doors would open
[16:36:06.920 --> 16:36:08.920]  a sergeant at arms would open these big doors
[16:36:08.920 --> 16:36:10.920]  I guess that's how they got to name
[16:36:10.920 --> 16:36:12.920]  the doors and in would walk
[16:36:12.920 --> 16:36:14.920]  this fat-slopping senator
[16:36:14.920 --> 16:36:16.920]  and my buddy would leave me
[16:36:16.920 --> 16:36:18.920]  as in the middle of a conversation
[16:36:18.920 --> 16:36:20.920]  and
[16:36:20.920 --> 16:36:22.920]  follow the senator like a little puppy
[16:36:22.920 --> 16:36:24.920]  dog and pull out his chair
[16:36:24.920 --> 16:36:26.920]  and help him sit down then he'd come back
[16:36:26.920 --> 16:36:28.920]  and I'd say to my pal what's the matter
[16:36:28.920 --> 16:36:30.920]  the cat can't sit down by himself
[16:36:30.920 --> 16:36:32.920]  he needs some help that's what it was
[16:36:32.920 --> 16:36:34.920]  all day long Alex
[16:36:34.920 --> 16:36:36.920]  grown men sucking up
[16:36:36.920 --> 16:36:38.920]  to get to the top
[16:36:38.920 --> 16:36:40.920]  and bowing down
[16:36:40.920 --> 16:36:42.920]  so what happens is
[16:36:42.920 --> 16:36:44.920]  you get a whole culture of these senators
[16:36:44.920 --> 16:36:46.920]  and congressmen
[16:36:46.920 --> 16:36:48.920]  and politicians
[16:36:48.920 --> 16:36:50.920]  they don't put on one
[16:36:50.920 --> 16:36:52.920]  leg at a time
[16:36:52.920 --> 16:36:54.920]  when they put their pants on like we do
[16:36:54.920 --> 16:36:56.920]  they have these people
[16:36:56.920 --> 16:36:58.920]  that they call them
[16:36:58.920 --> 16:37:00.920]  aides and staff
[16:37:00.920 --> 16:37:02.920]  it's better called
[16:37:02.920 --> 16:37:04.920]  serfs and slaves
[16:37:04.920 --> 16:37:06.920]  a bunch of gutless little
[16:37:06.920 --> 16:37:08.920]  genies out there
[16:37:08.920 --> 16:37:10.920]  that want to do everything they can
[16:37:10.920 --> 16:37:12.920]  that if they suck up enough
[16:37:12.920 --> 16:37:14.920]  they could move up the ladder
[16:37:14.920 --> 16:37:16.920]  so they're out of touch
[16:37:16.920 --> 16:37:18.920]  look at
[16:37:18.920 --> 16:37:20.920]  look at the
[16:37:20.920 --> 16:37:22.920]  the film
[16:37:22.920 --> 16:37:24.920]  look at how every time we see these
[16:37:24.920 --> 16:37:26.920]  senators and congressmen
[16:37:26.920 --> 16:37:28.920]  look at the lavish trappings
[16:37:28.920 --> 16:37:30.920]  around them
[16:37:30.920 --> 16:37:32.920]  look at the numbers
[16:37:32.920 --> 16:37:34.920]  how much money
[16:37:34.920 --> 16:37:36.920]  they're worth
[16:37:36.920 --> 16:37:38.920]  they don't have to worry like
[16:37:38.920 --> 16:37:40.920]  the rest of us do
[16:37:40.920 --> 16:37:42.920]  whether or not money is coming in
[16:37:42.920 --> 16:37:44.920]  look how they
[16:37:44.920 --> 16:37:46.920]  look how they show up
[16:37:46.920 --> 16:37:48.920]  when Obama or any of them
[16:37:48.920 --> 16:37:50.920]  with motorcades a mile long
[16:37:50.920 --> 16:37:52.920]  they close down
[16:37:52.920 --> 16:37:54.920]  New York City
[16:37:54.920 --> 16:37:56.920]  when this cat goes for
[16:37:56.920 --> 16:37:58.920]  a fundraising dinner
[16:37:58.920 --> 16:38:00.920]  that you got to cough up $38,000
[16:38:00.920 --> 16:38:02.920]  for
[16:38:02.920 --> 16:38:04.920]  and disrupts the entire
[16:38:04.920 --> 16:38:06.920]  end of the Manhattan
[16:38:06.920 --> 16:38:08.920]  so look what's going on
[16:38:08.920 --> 16:38:10.920]  do they care what we're going through
[16:38:10.920 --> 16:38:12.920]  let them eat
[16:38:12.920 --> 16:38:14.920]  cake
[16:38:14.920 --> 16:38:16.920]  they don't have an idea
[16:38:16.920 --> 16:38:18.920]  is it going to turn violent
[16:38:18.920 --> 16:38:20.920]  it already is
[16:38:20.920 --> 16:38:22.920]  what I'm saying is
[16:38:22.920 --> 16:38:24.920]  they're going to use
[16:38:24.920 --> 16:38:26.920]  the violence
[16:38:26.920 --> 16:38:28.920]  with the agents provocateurs
[16:38:28.920 --> 16:38:30.920]  mixed into it
[16:38:30.920 --> 16:38:32.920]  to use it as another excuse
[16:38:32.920 --> 16:38:34.920]  to clamp down
[16:38:34.920 --> 16:38:36.920]  on us even harder
[16:38:36.920 --> 16:38:38.920]  and as you well
[16:38:38.920 --> 16:38:40.920]  have documented with the FEMA camps
[16:38:40.920 --> 16:38:42.920]  with the atrocities
[16:38:42.920 --> 16:38:44.920]  from homeland security
[16:38:44.920 --> 16:38:46.920]  from the microphones
[16:38:46.920 --> 16:38:48.920]  now in the camera
[16:38:48.920 --> 16:38:50.920]  in the lights
[16:38:50.920 --> 16:38:52.920]  on and on and on
[16:38:52.920 --> 16:38:54.920]  big brother is not only
[16:38:54.920 --> 16:38:56.920]  watching us they're in bed
[16:38:56.920 --> 16:38:58.920]  with us so the worst
[16:38:58.920 --> 16:39:00.920]  violence becomes
[16:39:00.920 --> 16:39:02.920]  the more they clamp down
[16:39:02.920 --> 16:39:04.920]  because they're not going to
[16:39:04.920 --> 16:39:06.920]  hear the message and that's why
[16:39:06.920 --> 16:39:08.920]  what we're saying is
[16:39:08.920 --> 16:39:10.920]  it's not going to make any difference
[16:39:10.920 --> 16:39:12.920]  who's in office
[16:39:12.920 --> 16:39:14.920]  the republicans or the democrats
[16:39:14.920 --> 16:39:16.920]  the gambinos or the bananas
[16:39:16.920 --> 16:39:18.920]  you know Goldberg
[16:39:18.920 --> 16:39:20.920]  iceberg what's the difference
[16:39:20.920 --> 16:39:22.920]  well
[16:39:22.920 --> 16:39:24.920]  unfortunately you're right
[16:39:24.920 --> 16:39:26.920]  and we've seen this type of psychology
[16:39:26.920 --> 16:39:28.920]  throughout history but
[16:39:28.920 --> 16:39:30.920]  I'll never forget about
[16:39:30.920 --> 16:39:32.920]  15 years ago or so I went down
[16:39:32.920 --> 16:39:34.920]  and sat in the gallery and watched the Texas
[16:39:34.920 --> 16:39:36.920]  House of Representatives
[16:39:36.920 --> 16:39:38.920]  and it was all these men
[16:39:38.920 --> 16:39:40.920]  just completely getting off
[16:39:40.920 --> 16:39:42.920]  like a bunch of little kids
[16:39:42.920 --> 16:39:44.920]  in make believe strutting around
[16:39:44.920 --> 16:39:46.920]  and talking and glad handing
[16:39:46.920 --> 16:39:48.920]  and you know the men look like
[16:39:48.920 --> 16:39:50.920]  they had makeup on or something
[16:39:50.920 --> 16:39:52.920]  and they get off on these awards
[16:39:52.920 --> 16:39:54.920]  and press conferences
[16:39:54.920 --> 16:39:56.920]  they really are stunted
[16:39:56.920 --> 16:39:58.920]  I mean I would be embarrassed if
[16:39:58.920 --> 16:40:00.920]  people were pulling my chair out
[16:40:00.920 --> 16:40:02.920]  I would be embarrassed
[16:40:02.920 --> 16:40:04.920]  if people were all
[16:40:04.920 --> 16:40:06.920]  taking me serious like that
[16:40:06.920 --> 16:40:08.920]  because it turns it all into a joke
[16:40:08.920 --> 16:40:10.920]  but I guess I'm the weirdo
[16:40:10.920 --> 16:40:12.920]  compared to these people
[16:40:12.920 --> 16:40:14.920]  there's never enough banquets
[16:40:14.920 --> 16:40:16.920]  or never enough people kissing their butt
[16:40:16.920 --> 16:40:18.920]  never enough red carpets
[16:40:18.920 --> 16:40:20.920]  I mean I like nice things
[16:40:20.920 --> 16:40:22.920]  I like going to a nice vacation spot
[16:40:22.920 --> 16:40:24.920]  or a cabin at the national park
[16:40:24.920 --> 16:40:26.920]  I like nice things but
[16:40:26.920 --> 16:40:28.920]  I certainly don't want a bunch of
[16:40:28.920 --> 16:40:30.920]  the having the nice thing
[16:40:30.920 --> 16:40:32.920]  to pose status wise
[16:40:32.920 --> 16:40:34.920]  is an embarrassment
[16:40:34.920 --> 16:40:36.920]  it's an anachronism
[16:40:36.920 --> 16:40:38.920]  and I just don't, you're right
[16:40:38.920 --> 16:40:40.920]  I mean it is a culture
[16:40:40.920 --> 16:40:42.920]  of these vapid hollow
[16:40:42.920 --> 16:40:44.920]  and I'll watch them they'll sit around having dinner together
[16:40:44.920 --> 16:40:46.920]  and it's all completely fake
[16:40:46.920 --> 16:40:48.920]  when they're talking to each other
[16:40:48.920 --> 16:40:50.920]  it's total crap
[16:40:50.920 --> 16:40:52.920]  I love the way they laugh too
[16:40:52.920 --> 16:40:54.920]  the Joe Biden laugh
[16:40:56.920 --> 16:40:58.920]  and then every time you see
[16:40:58.920 --> 16:41:00.920]  these guys when they're doing
[16:41:00.920 --> 16:41:02.920]  something there's always like
[16:41:02.920 --> 16:41:04.920]  20 of them around you know when they're signing a bill
[16:41:04.920 --> 16:41:06.920]  or whatever when somebody's talking
[16:41:06.920 --> 16:41:08.920]  how come they're not working
[16:41:08.920 --> 16:41:10.920]  how come they're wasting their time
[16:41:10.920 --> 16:41:12.920]  you or I could never get away with that
[16:41:12.920 --> 16:41:14.920]  I know that people that work with me can't get away with that
[16:41:14.920 --> 16:41:16.920]  but they can
[16:41:16.920 --> 16:41:18.920]  and we're paying them
[16:41:18.920 --> 16:41:20.920]  nothing
[16:41:20.920 --> 16:41:22.920]  and so that's what's going on over here
[16:41:22.920 --> 16:41:24.920]  there's a total disconnect
[16:41:24.920 --> 16:41:26.920]  it's robbery to the nth degree
[16:41:26.920 --> 16:41:28.920]  that we don't have a representative
[16:41:28.920 --> 16:41:30.920]  form of government
[16:41:30.920 --> 16:41:32.920]  as you're seeing what's going on in Greece
[16:41:32.920 --> 16:41:34.920]  in Italy in the US
[16:41:34.920 --> 16:41:36.920]  the only people they represent
[16:41:36.920 --> 16:41:38.920]  are the special interests, the powerful
[16:41:38.920 --> 16:41:40.920]  and the people that give them money
[16:41:40.920 --> 16:41:42.920]  or they call it campaign contributions
[16:41:42.920 --> 16:41:44.920]  adults call it bribes and payoffs
[16:41:44.920 --> 16:41:46.920]  so what we're saying
[16:41:46.920 --> 16:41:48.920]  Alex is the only way this thing comes
[16:41:48.920 --> 16:41:50.920]  to any kind of a
[16:41:50.920 --> 16:41:52.920]  sensible solution
[16:41:52.920 --> 16:41:54.920]  is let the people vote
[16:41:54.920 --> 16:41:56.920]  and then I keep hearing by the way
[16:41:56.920 --> 16:41:58.920]  you know you have the trolls out there as you well know
[16:41:58.920 --> 16:42:00.920]  they say listen to Selenti
[16:42:00.920 --> 16:42:02.920]  51% of the people
[16:42:02.920 --> 16:42:04.920]  we could have mob rule if they vote
[16:42:04.920 --> 16:42:06.920]  oh mob rule
[16:42:06.920 --> 16:42:08.920]  what do you think you have now
[16:42:08.920 --> 16:42:10.920]  you have the mob in power
[16:42:10.920 --> 16:42:12.920]  only 535 of them
[16:42:12.920 --> 16:42:14.920]  they call themselves the democrats and the republicans
[16:42:14.920 --> 16:42:16.920]  or in other countries the social democrats
[16:42:16.920 --> 16:42:18.920]  or this or that
[16:42:18.920 --> 16:42:20.920]  the mobs are in control
[16:42:20.920 --> 16:42:22.920]  so we're saying let us create
[16:42:22.920 --> 16:42:24.920]  the future and by the way
[16:42:24.920 --> 16:42:26.920]  interesting with these occupy movements
[16:42:26.920 --> 16:42:28.920]  I believe
[16:42:28.920 --> 16:42:30.920]  they are going to succeed
[16:42:30.920 --> 16:42:32.920]  as long
[16:42:32.920 --> 16:42:34.920]  as there's no leader
[16:42:34.920 --> 16:42:36.920]  as long as there's no one
[16:42:36.920 --> 16:42:38.920]  look what happened to WikiLeaks
[16:42:38.920 --> 16:42:40.920]  when Assange became the face for it
[16:42:40.920 --> 16:42:42.920]  boom
[16:42:42.920 --> 16:42:44.920]  they knocked them down
[16:42:44.920 --> 16:42:46.920]  these phony charges
[16:42:46.920 --> 16:42:48.920]  or alleged charges I should say
[16:42:48.920 --> 16:42:50.920]  about sexual harassment
[16:42:50.920 --> 16:42:52.920]  of two women that picked them up
[16:42:52.920 --> 16:42:54.920]  over in Sweden
[16:42:54.920 --> 16:42:56.920]  you know so they have a head
[16:42:56.920 --> 16:42:58.920]  right now these occupy movements
[16:42:58.920 --> 16:43:00.920]  it's about
[16:43:00.920 --> 16:43:02.920]  the total system
[16:43:02.920 --> 16:43:04.920]  it's not about one person
[16:43:04.920 --> 16:43:06.920]  as long as
[16:43:06.920 --> 16:43:08.920]  it stays like that
[16:43:08.920 --> 16:43:10.920]  it's going to be successful
[16:43:10.920 --> 16:43:12.920]  I believe
[16:43:12.920 --> 16:43:14.920]  well Gerald
[16:43:14.920 --> 16:43:16.920]  looking at this
[16:43:18.920 --> 16:43:20.920]  if you go back to
[16:43:20.920 --> 16:43:22.920]  888
[16:43:22.920 --> 16:43:24.920]  the start of the Olympics 2008
[16:43:24.920 --> 16:43:26.920]  and again China is corrupt
[16:43:26.920 --> 16:43:28.920]  Russia is corrupt these are all mafias
[16:43:28.920 --> 16:43:30.920]  but the big powerful out of control mafia
[16:43:30.920 --> 16:43:32.920]  it was obviously here in the United States
[16:43:32.920 --> 16:43:34.920]  and Europe and England
[16:43:34.920 --> 16:43:36.920]  but looking at this
[16:43:36.920 --> 16:43:38.920]  when the west
[16:43:38.920 --> 16:43:40.920]  came out later
[16:43:40.920 --> 16:43:42.920]  funded Georgia to attack
[16:43:42.920 --> 16:43:44.920]  South Ossetia and Abkhazia held by the Russians
[16:43:44.920 --> 16:43:46.920]  in the UN
[16:43:46.920 --> 16:43:48.920]  and then they spotted on the news and said Russia
[16:43:48.920 --> 16:43:50.920]  had attacked
[16:43:50.920 --> 16:43:52.920]  and they had NATO troops
[16:43:52.920 --> 16:43:54.920]  landing until the Russians rolled
[16:43:54.920 --> 16:43:56.920]  mobile
[16:43:56.920 --> 16:43:58.920]  nuclear launchers in and their joint chiefs of staff
[16:43:58.920 --> 16:44:00.920]  said alright we're preparing to launch nuclear weapons
[16:44:00.920 --> 16:44:02.920]  on you
[16:44:02.920 --> 16:44:04.920]  that was on Russian TV and you didn't even see it here
[16:44:04.920 --> 16:44:06.920]  but then NATO backed off
[16:44:06.920 --> 16:44:08.920]  so it did show at a certain point
[16:44:08.920 --> 16:44:10.920]  they were just testing
[16:44:10.920 --> 16:44:12.920]  but that's so reckless
[16:44:12.920 --> 16:44:14.920]  these people have the power
[16:44:14.920 --> 16:44:16.920]  the trillions they've stolen
[16:44:16.920 --> 16:44:18.920]  why are they trying to start a nuclear war with Russia
[16:44:18.920 --> 16:44:20.920]  I mean at a certain point
[16:44:20.920 --> 16:44:22.920]  it shows that these people are so delusional
[16:44:22.920 --> 16:44:24.920]  that
[16:44:24.920 --> 16:44:26.920]  there's no telling what they might do
[16:44:26.920 --> 16:44:28.920]  well again look at the failures
[16:44:28.920 --> 16:44:30.920]  that they keep mounting up
[16:44:30.920 --> 16:44:32.920]  and keep getting away with
[16:44:32.920 --> 16:44:34.920]  look at Ben Bernanke
[16:44:34.920 --> 16:44:36.920]  this guy said in 2007
[16:44:36.920 --> 16:44:38.920]  in November when we came out
[16:44:38.920 --> 16:44:40.920]  we were entering into the panic
[16:44:40.920 --> 16:44:42.920]  of 08 in a few months
[16:44:42.920 --> 16:44:44.920]  he said we're not in recession
[16:44:44.920 --> 16:44:46.920]  he goes on and he says
[16:44:46.920 --> 16:44:48.920]  in 2008
[16:44:48.920 --> 16:44:50.920]  we're not in recession
[16:44:50.920 --> 16:44:52.920]  he says that his plans
[16:44:52.920 --> 16:44:54.920]  are going to correct things
[16:44:54.920 --> 16:44:56.920]  and they're only gotten worse
[16:44:56.920 --> 16:44:58.920]  whether the new job numbers came out
[16:44:58.920 --> 16:45:00.920]  they created a grand total of what
[16:45:00.920 --> 16:45:02.920]  80,000 jobs
[16:45:02.920 --> 16:45:04.920]  in the last month
[16:45:04.920 --> 16:45:06.920]  80,000 jobs
[16:45:06.920 --> 16:45:08.920]  you need 150,000
[16:45:08.920 --> 16:45:10.920]  just to stay even
[16:45:10.920 --> 16:45:12.920]  accounting for new people
[16:45:12.920 --> 16:45:14.920]  population growth
[16:45:14.920 --> 16:45:16.920]  and new people entering into the market
[16:45:16.920 --> 16:45:18.920]  and those are phony numbers anyway
[16:45:18.920 --> 16:45:20.920]  then you look at the jobs
[16:45:20.920 --> 16:45:22.920]  hey kiddies
[16:45:22.920 --> 16:45:24.920]  keep spending that money in college
[16:45:24.920 --> 16:45:26.920]  that's right
[16:45:26.920 --> 16:45:28.920]  get that degree as an MBA
[16:45:28.920 --> 16:45:30.920]  you could have a job
[16:45:30.920 --> 16:45:32.920]  you could become a cashier
[16:45:32.920 --> 16:45:34.920]  or a clerk
[16:45:34.920 --> 16:45:36.920]  you know how degrading it is
[16:45:36.920 --> 16:45:38.920]  I feel terrible when I go into
[16:45:38.920 --> 16:45:40.920]  I don't go into Walmart
[16:45:40.920 --> 16:45:42.920]  or any of these stores
[16:45:42.920 --> 16:45:44.920]  by the way just to flip off that
[16:45:44.920 --> 16:45:46.920]  for one second
[16:45:46.920 --> 16:45:48.920]  did you see how Bank of America
[16:45:48.920 --> 16:45:50.920]  backtracked on their $5
[16:45:50.920 --> 16:45:52.920]  debit fee
[16:45:52.920 --> 16:45:54.920]  they were going to pull on people
[16:45:54.920 --> 16:45:56.920]  yes that's an example of victory
[16:45:56.920 --> 16:45:58.920]  by the people
[16:45:58.920 --> 16:46:00.920]  and that's what I've been saying
[16:46:00.920 --> 16:46:02.920]  for how long
[16:46:02.920 --> 16:46:04.920]  break the chains
[16:46:04.920 --> 16:46:06.920]  break the chains
[16:46:06.920 --> 16:46:08.920]  as long as you
[16:46:08.920 --> 16:46:10.920]  support the chains
[16:46:10.920 --> 16:46:12.920]  they're going to have you chained
[16:46:12.920 --> 16:46:14.920]  I don't eat corporate food
[16:46:14.920 --> 16:46:16.920]  I don't go into
[16:46:16.920 --> 16:46:18.920]  Walmart's
[16:46:18.920 --> 16:46:20.920]  excuse me targets or the rest of them
[16:46:20.920 --> 16:46:22.920]  I stay away as much
[16:46:22.920 --> 16:46:24.920]  as I can
[16:46:24.920 --> 16:46:26.920]  you see these companies
[16:46:26.920 --> 16:46:28.920]  are so leveraged
[16:46:28.920 --> 16:46:30.920]  that if you not 10%
[16:46:30.920 --> 16:46:32.920]  growth off them
[16:46:32.920 --> 16:46:34.920]  they start to collapse
[16:46:34.920 --> 16:46:36.920]  if people would start building
[16:46:36.920 --> 16:46:38.920]  the domestic economy
[16:46:38.920 --> 16:46:40.920]  buying local
[16:46:40.920 --> 16:46:42.920]  yes spend a little more for higher quality
[16:46:42.920 --> 16:46:44.920]  you look at the numbers
[16:46:44.920 --> 16:46:46.920]  Alex
[16:46:46.920 --> 16:46:48.920]  1970
[16:46:48.920 --> 16:46:50.920]  the year I got my master's degree
[16:46:50.920 --> 16:46:52.920]  5%
[16:46:52.920 --> 16:46:54.920]  of the youth
[16:46:54.920 --> 16:46:56.920]  are obese
[16:46:56.920 --> 16:46:58.920]  now it's all hitting
[16:46:58.920 --> 16:47:00.920]  ranging toward 20%
[16:47:00.920 --> 16:47:02.920]  gee I wonder why
[16:47:02.920 --> 16:47:04.920]  couldn't be the crap
[16:47:04.920 --> 16:47:06.920]  that they're shoving down their throat
[16:47:06.920 --> 16:47:08.920]  nah
[16:47:08.920 --> 16:47:10.920]  has nothing to do with it
[16:47:10.920 --> 16:47:12.920]  couldn't be all that low quality
[16:47:12.920 --> 16:47:14.920]  hormone
[16:47:14.920 --> 16:47:16.920]  induced
[16:47:16.920 --> 16:47:18.920]  chemically added
[16:47:18.920 --> 16:47:20.920]  foods that they're
[16:47:20.920 --> 16:47:22.920]  shoving down their mouth
[16:47:22.920 --> 16:47:24.920]  nah nah nothing to do with it
[16:47:24.920 --> 16:47:26.920]  the only way we
[16:47:26.920 --> 16:47:28.920]  come back as a country
[16:47:28.920 --> 16:47:30.920]  is to build the domestic economy
[16:47:30.920 --> 16:47:32.920]  and I love the
[16:47:32.920 --> 16:47:34.920]  language from the
[16:47:34.920 --> 16:47:36.920]  jerks over at bank of America
[16:47:36.920 --> 16:47:38.920]  here's what they said
[16:47:38.920 --> 16:47:40.920]  we listen to our
[16:47:40.920 --> 16:47:42.920]  consumers
[16:47:42.920 --> 16:47:44.920]  and reconsidered
[16:47:44.920 --> 16:47:46.920]  our decision
[16:47:46.920 --> 16:47:48.920]  listen to your consumers
[16:47:48.920 --> 16:47:50.920]  they were giving it in
[16:47:50.920 --> 16:47:52.920]  to make it anymore
[16:47:52.920 --> 16:47:54.920]  break the chains
[16:47:54.920 --> 16:47:56.920]  don't drink
[16:47:56.920 --> 16:47:58.920]  Dunkin Donuts coffee
[16:47:58.920 --> 16:48:00.920]  go to your local coffee joint
[16:48:00.920 --> 16:48:02.920]  break the chains
[16:48:02.920 --> 16:48:04.920]  olive gardens
[16:48:04.920 --> 16:48:06.920]  not Italian food
[16:48:06.920 --> 16:48:08.920]  go to the local joint
[16:48:08.920 --> 16:48:10.920]  break the chains
[16:48:10.920 --> 16:48:12.920]  in any way that you can
[16:48:12.920 --> 16:48:14.920]  don't eat
[16:48:14.920 --> 16:48:16.920]  all of these
[16:48:16.920 --> 16:48:18.920]  factory farm foods
[16:48:18.920 --> 16:48:20.920]  by local
[16:48:20.920 --> 16:48:22.920]  spend a little more
[16:48:22.920 --> 16:48:24.920]  break the chains
[16:48:24.920 --> 16:48:26.920]  if you don't break the chains
[16:48:26.920 --> 16:48:28.920]  going back to how I started this
[16:48:28.920 --> 16:48:30.920]  all you kids
[16:48:30.920 --> 16:48:32.920]  that been shoved down
[16:48:32.920 --> 16:48:34.920]  your throat
[16:48:34.920 --> 16:48:36.920]  how to be good corporate
[16:48:36.920 --> 16:48:38.920]  servants by spending
[16:48:38.920 --> 16:48:40.920]  all that money
[16:48:40.920 --> 16:48:42.920]  getting an MBA to have some
[16:48:42.920 --> 16:48:44.920]  professor
[16:48:44.920 --> 16:48:46.920]  who's never worked a day in his life
[16:48:46.920 --> 16:48:48.920]  in the real world
[16:48:48.920 --> 16:48:50.920]  or if he or she has
[16:48:50.920 --> 16:48:52.920]  what corporate slaves themselves
[16:48:52.920 --> 16:48:54.920]  you can have a future
[16:48:54.920 --> 16:48:56.920]  being a corporate slave yourself
[16:48:56.920 --> 16:48:58.920]  you can
[16:48:58.920 --> 16:49:00.920]  help when people come in
[16:49:00.920 --> 16:49:02.920]  you can say hello
[16:49:02.920 --> 16:49:04.920]  and then after they give you
[16:49:04.920 --> 16:49:06.920]  your money and they sign the credit card
[16:49:06.920 --> 16:49:08.920]  you can say have a nice day
[16:49:08.920 --> 16:49:10.920]  and then you can go home
[16:49:10.920 --> 16:49:12.920]  and be miserable because you
[16:49:12.920 --> 16:49:14.920]  have not found the greatness within
[16:49:14.920 --> 16:49:16.920]  yourself
[16:49:16.920 --> 16:49:18.920]  you've been unable to find
[16:49:18.920 --> 16:49:20.920]  anything about who you are
[16:49:20.920 --> 16:49:22.920]  what you are
[16:49:22.920 --> 16:49:24.920]  the skills and dreams and desires you have
[16:49:24.920 --> 16:49:26.920]  because you had to be
[16:49:26.920 --> 16:49:28.920]  lived by the corporate rule book
[16:49:28.920 --> 16:49:30.920]  the only way this thing crashes
[16:49:30.920 --> 16:49:32.920]  is if the big businesses
[16:49:32.920 --> 16:49:34.920]  fold it's because the big
[16:49:34.920 --> 16:49:36.920]  businesses
[16:49:36.920 --> 16:49:38.920]  the two big businesses
[16:49:38.920 --> 16:49:40.920]  that we had to bail out
[16:49:40.920 --> 16:49:42.920]  are keeping you in track
[16:49:42.920 --> 16:49:44.920]  and you can change the bank
[16:49:44.920 --> 16:49:46.920]  of America one
[16:49:46.920 --> 16:49:48.920]  was the greatest example
[16:49:48.920 --> 16:49:50.920]  of what anybody could see
[16:49:50.920 --> 16:49:52.920]  of the power of the people
[16:49:52.920 --> 16:49:54.920]  beautifully said I tell you
[16:49:54.920 --> 16:49:56.920]  Gerald Salente is on fire we've got him

[16:50:12.920 --> 16:50:14.920]  NFL grope down 8 minute
[16:50:14.920 --> 16:50:16.920]  video we did so Gerald can take a break
[16:50:16.920 --> 16:50:18.920]  and so I can take a break you can visit
[16:50:18.920 --> 16:50:20.920]  trendsresearch.com while you're at it

[16:50:28.920 --> 16:50:30.920]  for the free market the videos

[16:50:32.920 --> 16:50:34.920]  the sponsors and you know we have
[16:50:34.920 --> 16:50:36.920]  these money bombs
[16:50:36.920 --> 16:50:38.920]  we should go into pure equipment
[16:50:38.920 --> 16:50:40.920]  guarantees it so I can be secure
[16:50:40.920 --> 16:50:42.920]  and hire folks and the globalist
[16:50:42.920 --> 16:50:44.920]  are great at getting us to give us their money
[16:50:44.920 --> 16:50:46.920]  you know for MPR and all these propaganda
[16:50:46.920 --> 16:50:48.920]  systems we're to take our money
[16:50:48.920 --> 16:50:50.920]  at gunpoint use it against us
[16:50:50.920 --> 16:50:52.920]  if you want to donate if you want to
[16:50:52.920 --> 16:50:54.920]  continue to build this platform
[16:50:54.920 --> 16:50:56.920]  for this information that reaches millions of people a day
[16:50:56.920 --> 16:50:58.920]  now and it's growing
[16:50:58.920 --> 16:51:00.920]  we really could use the support
[16:51:00.920 --> 16:51:02.920]  so we can hire three or four people for the nightly
[16:51:02.920 --> 16:51:04.920]  news so we've got some backup there
[16:51:04.920 --> 16:51:06.920]  can get even better reports out
[16:51:06.920 --> 16:51:08.920]  because we are literally a skeleton crew
[16:51:08.920 --> 16:51:10.920]  and also get some equipment
[16:51:10.920 --> 16:51:12.920]  we need to syndicate the nightly
[16:51:12.920 --> 16:51:14.920]  news show and expand it
[16:51:14.920 --> 16:51:16.920]  you can call
[16:51:16.920 --> 16:51:18.920]  888-253-3139
[16:51:18.920 --> 16:51:20.920]  888-253-3139
[16:51:20.920 --> 16:51:22.920]  the crew are in there to answer your call
[16:51:22.920 --> 16:51:24.920]  we've also got

[16:51:34.920 --> 16:51:36.920]  and it's just another funding mechanism
[16:51:36.920 --> 16:51:38.920]  because I can tell you
[16:51:38.920 --> 16:51:40.920]  I tend to spend
[16:51:40.920 --> 16:51:42.920]  a lot of my time trying to fund the operation
[16:51:42.920 --> 16:51:44.920]  obviously to even get the word out
[16:51:44.920 --> 16:51:46.920]  we don't have big globalist corporate sponsors
[16:51:46.920 --> 16:51:48.920]  we're supported by people
[16:51:48.920 --> 16:51:50.920]  out there who are watching

[16:52:18.920 --> 16:52:20.920]  and we'll get you up and on the air
[16:52:20.920 --> 16:52:22.920]  with your questions for Gerald Salente
[16:52:22.920 --> 16:52:24.920]  and you're getting a rare treat
[16:52:24.920 --> 16:52:26.920]  I am so tired from
[16:52:26.920 --> 16:52:28.920]  I don't know I've done already about
[16:52:28.920 --> 16:52:30.920]  17 hours
[16:52:30.920 --> 16:52:32.920]  of the 21 we did
[16:52:32.920 --> 16:52:34.920]  now we're going to like 20 hours of it or so
[16:52:34.920 --> 16:52:36.920]  the last hour or so with Gerald
[16:52:36.920 --> 16:52:38.920]  and so
[16:52:38.920 --> 16:52:40.920]  you're getting a rare treat we're actually shut up
[16:52:40.920 --> 16:52:42.920]  and they let Gerald talk and wow
[16:52:42.920 --> 16:52:44.920]  he's even more eloquent when I shut up
[16:52:44.920 --> 16:52:46.920]  so we're going to
[16:52:46.920 --> 16:52:48.920]  problem is like a little kid
[16:52:48.920 --> 16:52:50.920]  people say things and have all these thoughts
[16:52:50.920 --> 16:52:52.920]  I'm like yeah yeah yeah I want to add stuff
[16:52:52.920 --> 16:52:54.920]  it drives me crazy when my kids do it
[16:52:54.920 --> 16:52:56.920]  and here I am doing it but we're going to come back with Gerald
[16:52:56.920 --> 16:52:58.920]  and take your phone calls
[16:52:58.920 --> 16:53:00.920]  and we're going to be on the other side
[16:53:00.920 --> 16:53:02.920]  but if you want to be part of this fourth annual
[16:53:02.920 --> 16:53:04.920]  Moneybomb, the establishment hates the idea
[16:53:04.920 --> 16:53:06.920]  of people getting together and supporting platforms
[16:53:06.920 --> 16:53:08.920]  and ideas together that really scares the system
[16:53:08.920 --> 16:53:10.920]  then 888-253-3139
[16:53:10.920 --> 16:53:12.920]  or M4sMoneybomb.com
[16:53:12.920 --> 16:53:14.920]  and when we come back I wonder if you want to just
[16:53:14.920 --> 16:53:16.920]  expand on what Gerald has said
[16:53:16.920 --> 16:53:18.920]  it is voting with your dollars
[16:53:18.920 --> 16:53:20.920]  it is
[16:53:20.920 --> 16:53:22.920]  talking the talk, walking the walk
[16:53:22.920 --> 16:53:24.920]  it is extricating yourself
[16:53:24.920 --> 16:53:26.920]  number one big chain restaurants
[16:53:26.920 --> 16:53:28.920]  are never good
[16:53:28.920 --> 16:53:30.920]  number two big box stores are horrible
[16:53:30.920 --> 16:53:32.920]  and surveil you and treat you like crap
[16:53:32.920 --> 16:53:34.920]  and have a bunch of garbage you don't need
[16:53:34.920 --> 16:53:36.920]  number three these companies have all moved
[16:53:36.920 --> 16:53:38.920]  offshore and don't care about you and fund
[16:53:38.920 --> 16:53:40.920]  anti-gun grips you name it
[16:53:40.920 --> 16:53:42.920]  these are the globalist
[16:53:42.920 --> 16:53:44.920]  and it's deindustrialized our country
[16:53:44.920 --> 16:53:46.920]  and if you want to look in the mirror and ask
[16:53:46.920 --> 16:53:48.920]  why this is all happening, why we have criminals
[16:53:48.920 --> 16:53:50.920]  robbing us
[16:53:50.920 --> 16:53:52.920]  and squatting on us and humiliating us
[16:53:52.920 --> 16:53:54.920]  it's because we've let them
[16:53:54.920 --> 16:53:56.920]  know why we don't have any industry
[16:53:56.920 --> 16:53:58.920]  it's because we did nothing
[16:53:58.920 --> 16:54:00.920]  but buy things made in other countries
[16:54:00.920 --> 16:54:02.920]  it's because we stopped being
[16:54:02.920 --> 16:54:04.920]  made in America until 30 years ago
[16:54:04.920 --> 16:54:06.920]  was known as the absolute symbol
[16:54:06.920 --> 16:54:08.920]  of quality worldwide we lost our pride
[16:54:08.920 --> 16:54:10.920]  and that doesn't mean
[16:54:10.920 --> 16:54:12.920]  that I'm up here on a high horse or that I'm perfect
[16:54:12.920 --> 16:54:14.920]  or that I make all the right decisions
[16:54:14.920 --> 16:54:16.920]  or that I don't buy stuff made in China sometimes
[16:54:16.920 --> 16:54:18.920]  the point is I attempt
[16:54:18.920 --> 16:54:20.920]  and now it's gotten so bad
[16:54:20.920 --> 16:54:22.920]  it's hard to even do that
[16:54:22.920 --> 16:54:24.920]  it's how deep down the rat hole we've gotten
[16:54:24.920 --> 16:54:26.920]  so
[16:54:26.920 --> 16:54:28.920]  this is the defense against the globalist here
[16:54:28.920 --> 16:54:30.920]  ladies and gentlemen
[16:54:30.920 --> 16:54:32.920]  we'll be right back after this quick break
[16:54:32.920 --> 16:54:34.920]  looking at the TSA culture expanding nationwide
[16:54:34.920 --> 16:54:36.920]  we've got checkpoints as well
[16:54:36.920 --> 16:54:38.920]  we'll come back with Gerald Salente on the other side
[16:54:38.920 --> 16:54:40.920]  as we fight this 1984 society
[16:54:40.920 --> 16:54:42.920]  stay with us
[16:54:42.920 --> 16:54:44.920]  Alex Jones here reporting for
[16:54:44.920 --> 16:54:46.920]  Info Wars Nightly News with this special report
[16:54:46.920 --> 16:54:48.920]  well darker days have come
[16:54:48.920 --> 16:54:50.920]  to our republic
[16:54:50.920 --> 16:54:52.920]  once a bastion
[16:54:52.920 --> 16:54:54.920]  and light of liberty worldwide
[16:54:54.920 --> 16:54:56.920]  is now an example of tyranny and oppression
[16:54:56.920 --> 16:54:58.920]  not even seen in Soviet Russia
[16:54:58.920 --> 16:55:00.920]  or Nazi Germany
[16:55:00.920 --> 16:55:02.920]  not even the Nazi Germans set up checkpoints
[16:55:02.920 --> 16:55:04.920]  and groped peoples genitals
[16:55:04.920 --> 16:55:06.920]  now the NFL
[16:55:06.920 --> 16:55:08.920]  basically under unlawful orders
[16:55:08.920 --> 16:55:10.920]  by Big Sis
[16:55:10.920 --> 16:55:12.920]  Janet Napolitano
[16:55:12.920 --> 16:55:14.920]  has ordered the NFL
[16:55:14.920 --> 16:55:16.920]  to grop all 16

[16:55:20.920 --> 16:55:22.920]  every year
[16:55:22.920 --> 16:55:24.920]  in fact the teams have now announced today
[16:55:24.920 --> 16:55:26.920]  that starting this weekend
[16:55:26.920 --> 16:55:28.920]  everyone will be groped
[16:55:28.920 --> 16:55:30.920]  now before I get into this report
[16:55:30.920 --> 16:55:32.920]  notice first it's
[16:55:32.920 --> 16:55:34.920]  take your shoes off
[16:55:34.920 --> 16:55:36.920]  and take your belt off and take your jacket off
[16:55:36.920 --> 16:55:38.920]  then it's we're gonna grop you on the outside of your pants
[16:55:38.920 --> 16:55:40.920]  then it's we're going inside your pants
[16:55:40.920 --> 16:55:42.920]  now we're gonna put you in these microwave ovens
[16:55:42.920 --> 16:55:44.920]  that are killing the TSA workers
[16:55:44.920 --> 16:55:46.920]  as well
[16:55:46.920 --> 16:55:48.920]  and Big Sis at the last Super Bowl are there
[16:55:48.920 --> 16:55:50.920]  helping run the security of the Super Bowl in Dallas
[16:55:50.920 --> 16:55:52.920]  now
[16:55:52.920 --> 16:55:54.920]  it's going to happen at every event
[16:55:54.920 --> 16:55:56.920]  we're going to grop you from the ankles
[16:55:56.920 --> 16:55:58.920]  all the way up to your breast
[16:55:58.920 --> 16:56:00.920]  all the way up to your neck they say they're gonna grab your wife's breast
[16:56:00.920 --> 16:56:02.920]  they're going to take the diaper
[16:56:02.920 --> 16:56:04.920]  off of your baby
[16:56:04.920 --> 16:56:06.920]  the same stuff that goes on in
[16:56:06.920 --> 16:56:08.920]  the airports and people say
[16:56:08.920 --> 16:56:10.920]  well if you don't like it don't fly
[16:56:10.920 --> 16:56:12.920]  and then it's well if you don't like it don't go to
[16:56:12.920 --> 16:56:14.920]  an NFL game
[16:56:14.920 --> 16:56:16.920]  here's the problem it's always more
[16:56:16.920 --> 16:56:18.920]  more more ten years after
[16:56:18.920 --> 16:56:20.920]  9-11
[16:56:20.920 --> 16:56:22.920]  TSA is announcing
[16:56:22.920 --> 16:56:24.920]  and has now shown up
[16:56:24.920 --> 16:56:26.920]  in well just three four months ago
[16:56:26.920 --> 16:56:28.920]  in New Mexico groping people
[16:56:28.920 --> 16:56:30.920]  at a prom
[16:56:30.920 --> 16:56:32.920]  TSA has announced that they want to put
[16:56:32.920 --> 16:56:34.920]  their trained officers so
[16:56:34.920 --> 16:56:36.920]  so if you get
[16:56:36.920 --> 16:56:38.920]  knighted by the TSA that they wave a magic wand
[16:56:38.920 --> 16:56:40.920]  now you can violate people's rights
[16:56:40.920 --> 16:56:42.920]  police departments, state police
[16:56:42.920 --> 16:56:44.920]  and other federal police and private security
[16:56:44.920 --> 16:56:46.920]  guards are now saying
[16:56:46.920 --> 16:56:48.920]  they're gonna have a right without a warrant
[16:56:48.920 --> 16:56:50.920]  to stick their hands down your pants
[16:56:50.920 --> 16:56:52.920]  they're saying shopping malls
[16:56:52.920 --> 16:56:54.920]  Janet Napolitano is at the Super Bowl
[16:56:54.920 --> 16:56:56.920]  in other games in your face as if
[16:56:56.920 --> 16:56:58.920]  you wouldn't be safe if she wasn't
[16:56:58.920 --> 16:57:00.920]  here taking all your rights
[16:57:00.920 --> 16:57:02.920]  9,000 locations like Walmart
[16:57:02.920 --> 16:57:04.920]  with telescreens saying don't trust your neighbor
[16:57:04.920 --> 16:57:06.920]  only trust big sis
[16:57:06.920 --> 16:57:08.920]  and running PSAs where all the terrorists
[16:57:08.920 --> 16:57:10.920]  basically look like tea partiers
[16:57:10.920 --> 16:57:12.920]  this is all happening
[16:57:12.920 --> 16:57:14.920]  this is the authoritarian
[16:57:14.920 --> 16:57:16.920]  overthrow of America it has
[16:57:16.920 --> 16:57:18.920]  nothing to do with terrorism
[16:57:18.920 --> 16:57:20.920]  the government admits they put the underwear
[16:57:20.920 --> 16:57:22.920]  bomber on the plane on Christmas day
[16:57:22.920 --> 16:57:24.920]  that was staged on record
[16:57:24.920 --> 16:57:26.920]  all of this stuff is garbage
[16:57:26.920 --> 16:57:28.920]  and we're all the locking number three in al-qaeda
[16:57:28.920 --> 16:57:30.920]  he is hanging out secretly at the pentagon
[16:57:30.920 --> 16:57:32.920]  the state department has now come out
[16:57:32.920 --> 16:57:34.920]  and said that they won't give up his records
[16:57:34.920 --> 16:57:36.920]  for his privacy it's staged
[16:57:36.920 --> 16:57:38.920]  they're giving Libya
[16:57:38.920 --> 16:57:40.920]  over to al-qaeda they're giving al-qaeda
[16:57:40.920 --> 16:57:42.920]  a seat at the UN they're admitting they're engaged
[16:57:42.920 --> 16:57:44.920]  in genocide exterminating blacks
[16:57:44.920 --> 16:57:46.920]  but that's okay al-qaeda gets
[16:57:46.920 --> 16:57:48.920]  given a country but you
[16:57:48.920 --> 16:57:50.920]  your wife your children get to have
[16:57:50.920 --> 16:57:52.920]  private security grope them
[16:57:52.920 --> 16:57:54.920]  and that's all that's happening here
[16:57:54.920 --> 16:57:56.920]  is our republics being overthrown
[16:57:56.920 --> 16:57:58.920]  it's a federal power grab what jurisdiction
[16:57:58.920 --> 16:58:00.920]  does big sis have to be at all these big football games
[16:58:00.920 --> 16:58:02.920]  what jurisdiction to be
[16:58:02.920 --> 16:58:04.920]  in these public-private partnerships
[16:58:04.920 --> 16:58:06.920]  at walmart saying don't trust
[16:58:06.920 --> 16:58:08.920]  anybody let's say terrorism was real
[16:58:08.920 --> 16:58:10.920]  you've got a better chance of dying
[16:58:10.920 --> 16:58:12.920]  from being struck by lightning or bee stings
[16:58:12.920 --> 16:58:14.920]  look it up or being bit by a snake
[16:58:14.920 --> 16:58:16.920]  but we don't have checkpoints i'm out here in the woods
[16:58:16.920 --> 16:58:18.920]  you know do we have checkpoints right out here
[16:58:18.920 --> 16:58:20.920]  because i'll guarantee you there's copperheads
[16:58:20.920 --> 16:58:22.920]  i'll guarantee you i'm here in central texas
[16:58:22.920 --> 16:58:24.920]  i've killed rattlesnakes in these woods
[16:58:24.920 --> 16:58:26.920]  i've killed copperheads
[16:58:26.920 --> 16:58:28.920]  out the lake i've killed water moccasins
[16:58:28.920 --> 16:58:30.920]  should there be tsa everywhere
[16:58:30.920 --> 16:58:32.920]  because 500 plus people die a year or more
[16:58:32.920 --> 16:58:34.920]  from poisonous snake bites
[16:58:34.920 --> 16:58:36.920]  more than terrorism
[16:58:36.920 --> 16:58:38.920]  this idea that we're all
[16:58:38.920 --> 16:58:40.920]  guilty until proven innocent
[16:58:40.920 --> 16:58:42.920]  this idea that
[16:58:42.920 --> 16:58:44.920]  governments got to be there
[16:58:44.920 --> 16:58:46.920]  treating you as if you're guilty up front
[16:58:46.920 --> 16:58:48.920]  and groping you think about it
[16:58:48.920 --> 16:58:50.920]  imagine growing up if you would have heard
[16:58:50.920 --> 16:58:52.920]  that in the soviet union
[16:58:52.920 --> 16:58:54.920]  which by the way they didn't do this
[16:58:54.920 --> 16:58:56.920]  but imagine if they would have told you
[16:58:56.920 --> 16:58:58.920]  in the soviet union they grop you
[16:58:58.920 --> 16:59:00.920]  and grab your wife's breast and grab your genitals
[16:59:00.920 --> 16:59:02.920]  to go to a football game
[16:59:02.920 --> 16:59:04.920]  how did i know all this was coming
[16:59:04.920 --> 16:59:06.920]  in my film marshal law
[16:59:06.920 --> 16:59:08.920]  911 rise the police state
[16:59:08.920 --> 16:59:10.920]  i have state and national guard
[16:59:10.920 --> 16:59:12.920]  photos from their own websites
[16:59:12.920 --> 16:59:14.920]  where it showed them in 2003 4 and 5
[16:59:14.920 --> 16:59:16.920]  having military
[16:59:16.920 --> 16:59:18.920]  out groping small children
[16:59:18.920 --> 16:59:20.920]  at college football games
[16:59:20.920 --> 16:59:22.920]  in places like alabama and searching
[16:59:22.920 --> 16:59:24.920]  little 3 year olds little play
[16:59:24.920 --> 16:59:26.920]  purses this is about
[16:59:26.920 --> 16:59:28.920]  indoctrinating our children
[16:59:28.920 --> 16:59:30.920]  and turning our country into an absolute
[16:59:30.920 --> 16:59:32.920]  nightmare system and they know
[16:59:32.920 --> 16:59:34.920]  you need to fly for business
[16:59:34.920 --> 16:59:36.920]  or to see grandma who's dying of cancer
[16:59:36.920 --> 16:59:38.920]  they know you want to go see
[16:59:38.920 --> 16:59:40.920]  the overpriced football game
[16:59:40.920 --> 16:59:42.920]  and so they're saying okay
[16:59:42.920 --> 16:59:44.920]  we're going to beta test and train everybody
[16:59:44.920 --> 16:59:46.920]  that this is okay and acceptable in these areas
[16:59:46.920 --> 16:59:48.920]  and then roll it out on the streets
[16:59:48.920 --> 16:59:50.920]  so that's my final point here
[16:59:50.920 --> 16:59:52.920]  this is all premeditated
[16:59:52.920 --> 16:59:54.920]  governor ridge the head of homeland security
[16:59:54.920 --> 16:59:56.920]  almost nine years ago that's how i knew all this was coming
[16:59:56.920 --> 16:59:58.920]  on c span said you're going to have to have
[16:59:58.920 --> 17:00:00.920]  homeland security approval to have a job
[17:00:00.920 --> 17:00:02.920]  everything you do is going to be tracked
[17:00:02.920 --> 17:00:04.920]  face scanning license plate reading
[17:00:04.920 --> 17:00:06.920]  homeland security is going to have checkpoints
[17:00:06.920 --> 17:00:08.920]  all over the streets of america
[17:00:08.920 --> 17:00:10.920]  shopping malls you name it a total
[17:00:10.920 --> 17:00:12.920]  takeover worse than any third world
[17:00:12.920 --> 17:00:14.920]  country worse than north korea
[17:00:14.920 --> 17:00:16.920]  absolute abject oppression
[17:00:16.920 --> 17:00:18.920]  unspeakably
[17:00:18.920 --> 17:00:20.920]  unamerican ridiculously
[17:00:20.920 --> 17:00:22.920]  tyrannical and oppressive
[17:00:22.920 --> 17:00:24.920]  so we've got
[17:00:24.920 --> 17:00:26.920]  to draw the line here
[17:00:26.920 --> 17:00:28.920]  okay they're already pushing
[17:00:28.920 --> 17:00:30.920]  for tsa and malls and grocery stores
[17:00:30.920 --> 17:00:32.920]  they already have purchased all these big trucks
[17:00:32.920 --> 17:00:34.920]  they say they're going to set up on the side of the highway
[17:00:34.920 --> 17:00:36.920]  and make you go through
[17:00:36.920 --> 17:00:38.920]  they already have federally funded quote no refusal
[17:00:38.920 --> 17:00:40.920]  blood draws without warrants
[17:00:40.920 --> 17:00:42.920]  i mean imagine the nazis taking
[17:00:42.920 --> 17:00:44.920]  blood at checkpoints they're doing it
[17:00:44.920 --> 17:00:46.920]  they know foreign banks have taken over
[17:00:46.920 --> 17:00:48.920]  they know that you're going to try to take the country
[17:00:48.920 --> 17:00:50.920]  back so they're trying to in the name
[17:00:50.920 --> 17:00:52.920]  of security sell this
[17:00:52.920 --> 17:00:54.920]  soft slow incremental
[17:00:54.920 --> 17:00:56.920]  martial law
[17:00:56.920 --> 17:00:58.920]  but at a point it builds up
[17:00:58.920 --> 17:01:00.920]  to where it is a hardcore martial law
[17:01:00.920 --> 17:01:02.920]  and we're now reaching that point
[17:01:02.920 --> 17:01:04.920]  this is a scyop
[17:01:04.920 --> 17:01:06.920]  plain and simple it is so scary
[17:01:06.920 --> 17:01:08.920]  now this is all being done
[17:01:08.920 --> 17:01:10.920]  so they can rob you blind
[17:01:10.920 --> 17:01:12.920]  the country's bankrupt europe's imploding
[17:01:12.920 --> 17:01:14.920]  they're announcing world government openly
[17:01:14.920 --> 17:01:16.920]  they need to get this in place
[17:01:16.920 --> 17:01:18.920]  and so that's why i'm here to tell you
[17:01:18.920 --> 17:01:20.920]  even if you don't go watch the overpriced
[17:01:20.920 --> 17:01:22.920]  football games like 16
[17:01:22.920 --> 17:01:24.920]  plus million americans what they say
[17:01:24.920 --> 17:01:26.920]  16.5 million americans go to these stupid things
[17:01:26.920 --> 17:01:28.920]  they're now meaning they'll be
[17:01:28.920 --> 17:01:30.920]  four five hours to get in with the groping
[17:01:30.920 --> 17:01:32.920]  don't be part of this ritual of corruption
[17:01:32.920 --> 17:01:34.920]  boycott it and even if you don't
[17:01:34.920 --> 17:01:36.920]  go to nfl games talk
[17:01:36.920 --> 17:01:38.920]  about boycotting it
[17:01:38.920 --> 17:01:40.920]  write letters to the
[17:01:40.920 --> 17:01:42.920]  head of the nfl write letters to their
[17:01:42.920 --> 17:01:44.920]  sponsors most importantly and tell them
[17:01:44.920 --> 17:01:46.920]  i'm not buying jerseys i'm not
[17:01:46.920 --> 17:01:48.920]  watching football i'm not doing any of this
[17:01:48.920 --> 17:01:50.920]  i'm gonna go to a city council meeting
[17:01:50.920 --> 17:01:52.920]  and talk about liberty and freedom
[17:01:52.920 --> 17:01:54.920]  or i'm gonna write my congresspeople
[17:01:54.920 --> 17:01:56.920]  or i'm gonna call and talk radio
[17:01:56.920 --> 17:01:58.920]  i'm gonna get on the field of issues
[17:01:58.920 --> 17:02:00.920]  to save our republic and our society

[17:05:00.920 --> 17:05:02.920]  to the
[17:05:02.920 --> 17:05:04.920]  2011 money bomb
[17:05:04.920 --> 17:05:06.920]  this gets the trolls completely
[17:05:06.920 --> 17:05:08.920]  in a tizzy
[17:05:08.920 --> 17:05:10.920]  i mean it's all just it's free will
[17:05:10.920 --> 17:05:12.920]  we're not here forcing anybody to donate
[17:05:12.920 --> 17:05:14.920]  we appreciate those that have
[17:05:14.920 --> 17:05:16.920]  the government always demonizes groups
[17:05:16.920 --> 17:05:18.920]  and organizations and alternative media
[17:05:18.920 --> 17:05:20.920]  that try to actually build something
[17:05:20.920 --> 17:05:22.920]  because they want all of it they want to take it
[17:05:22.920 --> 17:05:24.920]  from you and then use it against you
[17:05:24.920 --> 17:05:26.920]  the idea of free association
[17:05:26.920 --> 17:05:28.920]  and what gerald was getting into
[17:05:28.920 --> 17:05:30.920]  earlier i mean this is a victory
[17:05:30.920 --> 17:05:32.920]  because i remember reading years ago the big bank
[17:05:32.920 --> 17:05:34.920]  said under a cashless society
[17:05:34.920 --> 17:05:36.920]  and they'll be able to put little fees
[17:05:36.920 --> 17:05:38.920]  and fines everywhere and they'll make you take
[17:05:38.920 --> 17:05:40.920]  automatic transfer a lot of companies
[17:05:40.920 --> 17:05:42.920]  trying to make your employees do that now
[17:05:42.920 --> 17:05:44.920]  they're trying to do they got ads demonizing
[17:05:44.920 --> 17:05:46.920]  cash and now louisiana's passed
[17:05:46.920 --> 17:05:48.920]  a law where you can't use cash in second
[17:05:48.920 --> 17:05:50.920]  hand sales like you're all criminals and
[17:05:50.920 --> 17:05:52.920]  living in a prison and can't be trusted you know
[17:05:52.920 --> 17:05:54.920]  the prisoners aren't allowed in the cell
[17:05:54.920 --> 17:05:56.920]  block to have cash
[17:05:56.920 --> 17:05:58.920]  i mean it's ridiculous
[17:05:58.920 --> 17:06:00.920]  what's being done all over the
[17:06:00.920 --> 17:06:02.920]  country hundreds of arrest
[17:06:02.920 --> 17:06:04.920]  and and and fines girl scouts
[17:06:04.920 --> 17:06:06.920]  can't sell cookies
[17:06:06.920 --> 17:06:08.920]  kids can't have lemonade
[17:06:08.920 --> 17:06:10.920]  amish being raided i mean
[17:06:10.920 --> 17:06:12.920]  can't have a garden
[17:06:12.920 --> 17:06:14.920]  i mean this is ridiculous
[17:06:14.920 --> 17:06:16.920]  this is beyond
[17:06:16.920 --> 17:06:18.920]  1984 in many levels
[17:06:18.920 --> 17:06:20.920]  but it shows gerald what you've talked about for years
[17:06:20.920 --> 17:06:22.920]  they're scared
[17:06:22.920 --> 17:06:24.920]  of the grassroots economy
[17:06:24.920 --> 17:06:26.920]  they're scared of what you and others have talked
[17:06:26.920 --> 17:06:28.920]  about because they know
[17:06:28.920 --> 17:06:30.920]  when people stop buying from the big
[17:06:30.920 --> 17:06:32.920]  box stores when people stop
[17:06:32.920 --> 17:06:34.920]  supporting the establishment when people
[17:06:34.920 --> 17:06:36.920]  pull themselves out of the system even partially
[17:06:36.920 --> 17:06:38.920]  because the system is leveraged
[17:06:38.920 --> 17:06:40.920]  they go down
[17:06:40.920 --> 17:06:42.920]  yeah that's it and people should really understand that
[17:06:42.920 --> 17:06:44.920]  they're so highly leveraged
[17:06:44.920 --> 17:06:46.920]  that if sales decline
[17:06:46.920 --> 17:06:48.920]  at a very small percentage
[17:06:48.920 --> 17:06:50.920]  they start folding really fast
[17:06:50.920 --> 17:06:52.920]  they can't keep it up
[17:06:52.920 --> 17:06:54.920]  so that's what you saw again the bank of america
[17:06:54.920 --> 17:06:56.920]  example was perfect
[17:06:56.920 --> 17:06:58.920]  and you mentioned about
[17:06:58.920 --> 17:07:00.920]  how the gastapo
[17:07:00.920 --> 17:07:02.920]  the garden gastapo and the rest of them out there
[17:07:02.920 --> 17:07:04.920]  are breaking down people
[17:07:04.920 --> 17:07:06.920]  for selling raw
[17:07:06.920 --> 17:07:08.920]  not even selling bartering raw milk
[17:07:08.920 --> 17:07:10.920]  people holding dinners
[17:07:10.920 --> 17:07:12.920]  and the gastapo come in and want to know
[17:07:12.920 --> 17:07:14.920]  where they bought the food from
[17:07:14.920 --> 17:07:16.920]  you know on and on
[17:07:16.920 --> 17:07:18.920]  they're screwing the little people
[17:07:18.920 --> 17:07:20.920]  but here's another example alex
[17:07:20.920 --> 17:07:22.920]  when i went down to occupy

[17:09:32.920 --> 17:09:34.920]  crooks you know the
[17:09:34.920 --> 17:09:36.920]  Goldman Sachs gang

[17:09:48.920 --> 17:09:50.920]  you got the orders
[17:09:50.920 --> 17:09:52.920]  from the top leave the big
[17:09:52.920 --> 17:09:54.920]  guys alone
[17:09:54.920 --> 17:09:56.920]  that's what all these protests
[17:09:56.920 --> 17:09:58.920]  are about it's as simple
[17:09:58.920 --> 17:10:00.920]  as that
[17:10:00.920 --> 17:10:02.920]  the rich are taking everything
[17:10:02.920 --> 17:10:04.920]  justice
[17:10:04.920 --> 17:10:06.920]  no no it's just
[17:10:06.920 --> 17:10:08.920]  us we're the
[17:10:08.920 --> 17:10:10.920]  only ones
[17:10:10.920 --> 17:10:12.920]  the guys at the top get a free
[17:10:12.920 --> 17:10:14.920]  ride look at congress
[17:10:14.920 --> 17:10:16.920]  in that House of Wieners
[17:10:16.920 --> 17:10:18.920]  remember that one he pulled
[17:10:18.920 --> 17:10:20.920]  off he gets all his
[17:10:20.920 --> 17:10:22.920]  benefits no tough
[17:10:22.920 --> 17:10:24.920]  time for these guys
[17:10:24.920 --> 17:10:26.920]  only for you and me
[17:10:26.920 --> 17:10:28.920]  well here's a question why would the New York governor
[17:10:28.920 --> 17:10:30.920]  get a law
[17:10:30.920 --> 17:10:32.920]  passed to take the property
[17:10:32.920 --> 17:10:34.920]  and put people that you know
[17:10:34.920 --> 17:10:36.920]  higher prostitutes
[17:10:36.920 --> 17:10:38.920]  longer prison sentences while he was
[17:10:38.920 --> 17:10:40.920]  a
[17:10:40.920 --> 17:10:42.920]  a hooker loving aficionado
[17:10:42.920 --> 17:10:44.920]  I mean what kind of mental
[17:10:44.920 --> 17:10:46.920]  condition is that I mean
[17:10:46.920 --> 17:10:48.920]  I don't visit hookers but I'm for
[17:10:48.920 --> 17:10:50.920]  you know decriminalizing it because it makes
[17:10:50.920 --> 17:10:52.920]  the legal it makes it dirty it makes it bad
[17:10:52.920 --> 17:10:54.920]  I don't like it but you know it's freedom
[17:10:54.920 --> 17:10:56.920]  you know that's my point
[17:10:56.920 --> 17:10:58.920]  is that what type of weirdo
[17:10:58.920 --> 17:11:00.920]  tries to pass a bunch of laws
[17:11:00.920 --> 17:11:02.920]  while they're running around
[17:11:02.920 --> 17:11:04.920]  with you know screwing hookers every
[17:11:04.920 --> 17:11:06.920]  day and you know high dollar ones
[17:11:06.920 --> 17:11:08.920]  I mean it just shows a sickness
[17:11:08.920 --> 17:11:10.920]  of these crooks
[17:11:10.920 --> 17:11:12.920]  and then expanding on that
[17:11:12.920 --> 17:11:14.920]  then he gets a TV show
[17:11:14.920 --> 17:11:16.920]  yeah and look at the guy now Cuomo
[17:11:16.920 --> 17:11:18.920]  you have these occupied people
[17:11:18.920 --> 17:11:20.920]  they're protesting against the
[17:11:20.920 --> 17:11:22.920]  1% that are getting
[17:11:22.920 --> 17:11:24.920]  free rides you know tax benefits
[17:11:24.920 --> 17:11:26.920]  breaks all across the board
[17:11:26.920 --> 17:11:28.920]  and they want to raise the taxes on these people
[17:11:28.920 --> 17:11:30.920]  you know what Cuomo said
[17:11:30.920 --> 17:11:32.920]  I'm not
[17:11:32.920 --> 17:11:34.920]  going to listen to him I'm going to do what I want
[17:11:34.920 --> 17:11:36.920]  whatever happened
[17:11:36.920 --> 17:11:38.920]  to this thought public servant
[17:11:38.920 --> 17:11:40.920]  can you handle that one
[17:11:40.920 --> 17:11:42.920]  these guys keep drilling into our heads
[17:11:42.920 --> 17:11:44.920]  they're public servants none of them
[17:11:44.920 --> 17:11:46.920]  have cleaned my toilet lately
[17:11:46.920 --> 17:11:48.920]  and they don't tell you
[17:11:48.920 --> 17:11:50.920]  and they don't and he goes out
[17:11:50.920 --> 17:11:52.920]  and says I'm not going
[17:11:52.920 --> 17:11:54.920]  to do what you
[17:11:54.920 --> 17:11:56.920]  want me to do
[17:11:56.920 --> 17:11:58.920]  even though the vast majority
[17:11:58.920 --> 17:12:00.920]  of you want me
[17:12:00.920 --> 17:12:02.920]  to do it because don't you
[17:12:02.920 --> 17:12:04.920]  know who I am
[17:12:04.920 --> 17:12:06.920]  don't you know who daddy is
[17:12:06.920 --> 17:12:08.920]  that's what the whole thing is
[17:12:08.920 --> 17:12:10.920]  having Princeton Yale
[17:12:10.920 --> 17:12:12.920]  bullish banks and
[17:12:12.920 --> 17:12:14.920]  bombs that's why
[17:12:14.920 --> 17:12:16.920]  I am promoting
[17:12:16.920 --> 17:12:18.920]  directdemocracynow.org
[17:12:20.920 --> 17:12:22.920]  let the people vote
[17:12:22.920 --> 17:12:24.920]  who is this Cuomo to say
[17:12:24.920 --> 17:12:26.920]  we want to raise the
[17:12:26.920 --> 17:12:28.920]  taxes on the
[17:12:28.920 --> 17:12:30.920]  blank fines on the diamonds
[17:12:30.920 --> 17:12:32.920]  on the princes
[17:12:32.920 --> 17:12:34.920]  and you say
[17:12:34.920 --> 17:12:36.920]  hey Salenty
[17:12:36.920 --> 17:12:38.920]  screw you
[17:12:38.920 --> 17:12:40.920]  don't you know who I am
[17:12:40.920 --> 17:12:42.920]  I'm the governor
[17:12:42.920 --> 17:12:44.920]  you hired me to make these tough choices
[17:12:44.920 --> 17:12:46.920]  no no junior
[17:12:46.920 --> 17:12:48.920]  we hired you to do what
[17:12:48.920 --> 17:12:50.920]  we want you to do
[17:12:50.920 --> 17:12:52.920]  could you get that in your head
[17:12:52.920 --> 17:12:54.920]  public servant
[17:12:54.920 --> 17:12:56.920]  well we're going to call now
[17:12:56.920 --> 17:12:58.920]  in the 15 minutes or so we have
[17:12:58.920 --> 17:13:00.920]  left with Joel Salento two bad times winding down
[17:13:00.920 --> 17:13:02.920]  we'll look at him with calls even after he leaves us
[17:13:02.920 --> 17:13:04.920]  but look at Europe
[17:13:04.920 --> 17:13:06.920]  just two weeks ago
[17:13:06.920 --> 17:13:08.920]  the prime minister
[17:13:08.920 --> 17:13:10.920]  of England came out
[17:13:10.920 --> 17:13:12.920]  and said well you are under the euro
[17:13:12.920 --> 17:13:14.920]  and we are going to steal hundreds of billions from you
[17:13:14.920 --> 17:13:16.920]  and you're not going to ever be able to get
[17:13:16.920 --> 17:13:18.920]  out of it and I understand
[17:13:18.920 --> 17:13:20.920]  85% in polls of you want
[17:13:20.920 --> 17:13:22.920]  to be able to vote on being
[17:13:22.920 --> 17:13:24.920]  brought into the euro
[17:13:24.920 --> 17:13:26.920]  but I've decided that
[17:13:26.920 --> 17:13:28.920]  I'm not going to allow that
[17:13:28.920 --> 17:13:30.920]  I mean he even tells you
[17:13:30.920 --> 17:13:32.920]  that he's going to
[17:13:32.920 --> 17:13:34.920]  sit there
[17:13:34.920 --> 17:13:36.920]  and treat you like an absolute prisoner
[17:13:36.920 --> 17:13:38.920]  I mean I guess because they are prisoners
[17:13:38.920 --> 17:13:40.920]  but it's this I mean these guys really
[17:13:40.920 --> 17:13:42.920]  are they do have a confidence game going on
[17:13:42.920 --> 17:13:44.920]  it is oh he's an
[17:13:44.920 --> 17:13:46.920]  eating boy
[17:13:46.920 --> 17:13:48.920]  each guys when they fall
[17:13:48.920 --> 17:13:50.920]  there's somebody there to catch him
[17:13:50.920 --> 17:13:52.920]  these guys never got their fingernails
[17:13:52.920 --> 17:13:54.920]  dirty in their life
[17:13:54.920 --> 17:13:56.920]  they're a bunch of spoiled little boys
[17:13:56.920 --> 17:13:58.920]  they're only tough
[17:13:58.920 --> 17:14:00.920]  when they're up on that podium
[17:14:00.920 --> 17:14:02.920]  and they got their phalanx of gods
[17:14:02.920 --> 17:14:04.920]  around them the flunkies
[17:14:04.920 --> 17:14:06.920]  to keep the crowds away
[17:14:06.920 --> 17:14:08.920]  I'd like for them to come to talk
[17:14:08.920 --> 17:14:10.920]  to me like that
[17:14:10.920 --> 17:14:12.920]  and I like this pizza cat
[17:14:12.920 --> 17:14:14.920]  that guy running for president came
[17:14:14.920 --> 17:14:16.920]  he said you know those people on
[17:14:16.920 --> 17:14:18.920]  Wall Street they're anti-capitalist
[17:14:18.920 --> 17:14:20.920]  no no junior
[17:14:20.920 --> 17:14:22.920]  you got it wrong
[17:14:22.920 --> 17:14:24.920]  it's anti-capitalist to bail out banks
[17:14:24.920 --> 17:14:26.920]  you got it
[17:14:26.920 --> 17:14:28.920]  it's anti-capitalist to bail out too big
[17:14:28.920 --> 17:14:30.920]  to fails got it
[17:14:30.920 --> 17:14:32.920]  it's anti-capitalist to give your buddies
[17:14:32.920 --> 17:14:34.920]  tax breaks loan guarantees
[17:14:34.920 --> 17:14:36.920]  hey listen I'm gonna come in here
[17:14:36.920 --> 17:14:38.920]  I'm gonna create 500 jobs
[17:14:38.920 --> 17:14:40.920]  oh great we'll give you
[17:14:40.920 --> 17:14:42.920]  a 40 million dollar tax break
[17:14:42.920 --> 17:14:44.920]  we'll build you an infrastructure
[17:14:44.920 --> 17:14:46.920]  and we'll give you loan guarantees
[17:14:46.920 --> 17:14:48.920]  that's anti-capitalist
[17:14:48.920 --> 17:14:50.920]  this is not capitalism
[17:14:50.920 --> 17:14:52.920]  it's fascism
[17:14:52.920 --> 17:14:54.920]  the merger of state
[17:14:54.920 --> 17:14:56.920]  and corporate
[17:14:56.920 --> 17:14:58.920]  that's right I never hear Rush Limbaugh complain
[17:14:58.920 --> 17:15:00.920]  about a billion bucks to Jerry Jones
[17:15:00.920 --> 17:15:02.920]  to build that stupid football stadium
[17:15:02.920 --> 17:15:04.920]  Colin in England you're on the air
[17:15:04.920 --> 17:15:06.920]  thanks for holding you're with Gerald Salante
[17:15:06.920 --> 17:15:08.920]  of the Trends Research Institute go ahead
[17:15:08.920 --> 17:15:10.920]  okay thank you very much Mr
[17:15:10.920 --> 17:15:12.920]  Mr. Alex Jones
[17:15:12.920 --> 17:15:14.920]  first thing I'd like to say is
[17:15:14.920 --> 17:15:16.920]  if America falls
[17:15:16.920 --> 17:15:18.920]  then the whole world's gonna fall
[17:15:18.920 --> 17:15:20.920]  and Mr. Jerry Salante
[17:15:20.920 --> 17:15:22.920]  where I think he's wrong is
[17:15:22.920 --> 17:15:24.920]  gonna end without a shot being fired
[17:15:24.920 --> 17:15:26.920]  it's completely mistaking
[17:15:26.920 --> 17:15:28.920]  over there in America
[17:15:28.920 --> 17:15:30.920]  you're allowed guns but here in England
[17:15:30.920 --> 17:15:32.920]  you're not even allowed to have a bullet
[17:15:32.920 --> 17:15:34.920]  if the police don't say you have a bullet
[17:15:34.920 --> 17:15:36.920]  they're gonna come kicking off your door
[17:15:36.920 --> 17:15:38.920]  let me give you a news flash Colin
[17:15:38.920 --> 17:15:40.920]  I'm not for violence you can get any guns
[17:15:40.920 --> 17:15:42.920]  you want you know how easy it is
[17:15:42.920 --> 17:15:44.920]  to get guns all you need is a knife
[17:15:44.920 --> 17:15:46.920]  all you need is a club
[17:15:46.920 --> 17:15:48.920]  you can get all the guns you want
[17:15:48.920 --> 17:15:50.920]  all you gotta be is willing to use the club
[17:15:50.920 --> 17:15:52.920]  you can get all the guns you want
[17:15:52.920 --> 17:15:54.920]  but it is a culture of not knowing how to use them
[17:15:54.920 --> 17:15:56.920]  you know that's the real issue and the real problem
[17:15:56.920 --> 17:15:58.920]  is there's not a gun culture
[17:15:58.920 --> 17:16:00.920]  they've eradicated it but Colin
[17:16:00.920 --> 17:16:02.920]  go ahead and make your point
[17:16:02.920 --> 17:16:04.920]  okay well one of the points I wanted to make
[17:16:04.920 --> 17:16:06.920]  is that at 9-11 over here
[17:16:06.920 --> 17:16:08.920]  when I was watching on English TV
[17:16:08.920 --> 17:16:10.920]  it was so nauseating
[17:16:10.920 --> 17:16:12.920]  it was so I wanted to just push my fingers
[17:16:12.920 --> 17:16:14.920]  down my throat and vomit
[17:16:14.920 --> 17:16:16.920]  the point I'm trying to make is
[17:16:16.920 --> 17:16:18.920]  I don't want the people in America
[17:16:18.920 --> 17:16:20.920]  if even just say
[17:16:20.920 --> 17:16:22.920]  ten thousand people got to ground zero
[17:16:22.920 --> 17:16:24.920]  on the day I mean that is just
[17:16:24.920 --> 17:16:26.920]  a fraction of a one percent
[17:16:26.920 --> 17:16:28.920]  what you need on ground zero
[17:16:28.920 --> 17:16:30.920]  you say four or five percent
[17:16:30.920 --> 17:16:32.920]  of the American population
[17:16:32.920 --> 17:16:34.920]  to gravitate on ground zero
[17:16:34.920 --> 17:16:36.920]  and they wouldn't be
[17:16:36.920 --> 17:16:38.920]  the police and the army wouldn't be able to control them
[17:16:38.920 --> 17:16:40.920]  and that's how they have to get their message
[17:16:40.920 --> 17:16:42.920]  alright 9-11 was a bad
[17:16:42.920 --> 17:16:44.920]  it was an inside job
[17:16:44.920 --> 17:16:46.920]  we all know that and it was a bad day
[17:16:46.920 --> 17:16:48.920]  for everyone but they were on new world order
[17:16:48.920 --> 17:16:50.920]  use that as a platform
[17:16:50.920 --> 17:16:52.920]  to propagate their propaganda
[17:16:52.920 --> 17:16:54.920]  so what we need to do is use 9-11
[17:16:54.920 --> 17:16:56.920]  and ground zero to
[17:16:56.920 --> 17:16:58.920]  to push the truth
[17:16:58.920 --> 17:17:00.920]  and not only that
[17:17:00.920 --> 17:17:02.920]  Colin I hear you
[17:17:02.920 --> 17:17:04.920]  Colin I hear you
[17:17:04.920 --> 17:17:06.920]  finish your point because our guest
[17:17:06.920 --> 17:17:08.920]  got to leave soon I want to be able to get to some other callers
[17:17:10.920 --> 17:17:12.920]  what we need is a real push on 9-11
[17:17:12.920 --> 17:17:14.920]  come 9-11 next year we need
[17:17:14.920 --> 17:17:16.920]  more than just a few thousand people at ground zero
[17:17:16.920 --> 17:17:18.920]  one more thing
[17:17:18.920 --> 17:17:20.920]  if you want to sell some t-shirts
[17:17:20.920 --> 17:17:22.920]  I want a t-shirt
[17:17:22.920 --> 17:17:24.920]  with your face on it
[17:17:24.920 --> 17:17:26.920]  those t-shirts will sell
[17:17:26.920 --> 17:17:28.920]  one more thing you to me
[17:17:28.920 --> 17:17:30.920]  Alex Jones you are like
[17:17:30.920 --> 17:17:32.920]  reincarnation of Malcolm X
[17:17:32.920 --> 17:17:34.920]  you really are
[17:17:34.920 --> 17:17:36.920]  you are doing exactly what Malcolm X was doing
[17:17:36.920 --> 17:17:38.920]  you're not going to shut up
[17:17:38.920 --> 17:17:40.920]  you're not going to go away and you're not going to keep quiet
[17:17:40.920 --> 17:17:42.920]  I hold you that much in the highest theme
[17:17:42.920 --> 17:17:44.920]  you really are the man for the job
[17:17:44.920 --> 17:17:46.920]  and I salute you and I bow down to you
[17:17:46.920 --> 17:17:48.920]  Mr. Malcolm X
[17:17:48.920 --> 17:17:50.920]  oh please stop Colin
[17:17:50.920 --> 17:17:52.920]  I appreciate the call
[17:17:52.920 --> 17:17:54.920]  look I don't want Malcolm X
[17:17:54.920 --> 17:17:56.920]  I think it's probably a better speaker than I am
[17:17:56.920 --> 17:17:58.920]  he certainly you know
[17:17:58.920 --> 17:18:00.920]  you saw what the system did to him
[17:18:00.920 --> 17:18:02.920]  but I think we're all basically
[17:18:02.920 --> 17:18:04.920]  a little George Washington
[17:18:04.920 --> 17:18:06.920]  little Malcolm X at the same time
[17:18:06.920 --> 17:18:08.920]  that's what's needed right now
[17:18:08.920 --> 17:18:10.920]  any comments Gerald Salente on what Colin was saying
[17:18:10.920 --> 17:18:12.920]  we're saying we don't
[17:18:12.920 --> 17:18:14.920]  it's not going to solve anything it's only going to make matters worse
[17:18:14.920 --> 17:18:16.920]  and
[17:18:16.920 --> 17:18:18.920]  there's no question
[17:18:18.920 --> 17:18:20.920]  you just don't win with violence
[17:18:20.920 --> 17:18:22.920]  again you'll be replacing
[17:18:22.920 --> 17:18:24.920]  one group of criminals
[17:18:24.920 --> 17:18:26.920]  with another so
[17:18:26.920 --> 17:18:28.920]  it has to be an intellectual revolution
[17:18:28.920 --> 17:18:30.920]  going to a higher civilization
[17:18:30.920 --> 17:18:32.920]  and I said this before matter of fact
[17:18:32.920 --> 17:18:34.920]  the autumn trends journal just came out
[17:18:34.920 --> 17:18:36.920]  and what we do is the message is
[17:18:36.920 --> 17:18:38.920]  the future is in your hands
[17:18:38.920 --> 17:18:40.920]  everybody has to do something
[17:18:40.920 --> 17:18:42.920]  to change the future in a positive way
[17:18:42.920 --> 17:18:44.920]  but it begins with the individual
[17:18:44.920 --> 17:18:46.920]  there's that Hindu saying when the
[17:18:46.920 --> 17:18:48.920]  students ready the teacher appears
[17:18:48.920 --> 17:18:50.920]  when the people are ready the change is going to happen
[17:18:50.920 --> 17:18:52.920]  and I don't see the people ready yet
[17:18:52.920 --> 17:18:54.920]  I mentioned about the obesity issue
[17:18:54.920 --> 17:18:56.920]  you have to be in
[17:18:56.920 --> 17:18:58.920]  you have to be in shape physically
[17:18:58.920 --> 17:19:00.920]  emotionally and spiritually
[17:19:00.920 --> 17:19:02.920]  and I'm not talking about you know
[17:19:02.920 --> 17:19:04.920]  believing in somebody's
[17:19:04.920 --> 17:19:06.920]  other religion I'm talking about
[17:19:06.920 --> 17:19:08.920]  the truth with yourself
[17:19:08.920 --> 17:19:10.920]  judgment data because judging yourself
[17:19:10.920 --> 17:19:12.920]  did you live up to the expectations
[17:19:12.920 --> 17:19:14.920]  of who you say you could be
[17:19:14.920 --> 17:19:16.920]  so when enough people start changing
[17:19:16.920 --> 17:19:18.920]  then we see the positive change
[17:19:18.920 --> 17:19:20.920]  do more people have to get involved
[17:19:20.920 --> 17:19:22.920]  of course they do it's happening
[17:19:22.920 --> 17:19:24.920]  this is a movement that is a
[17:19:24.920 --> 17:19:26.920]  gut issue and that's why
[17:19:26.920 --> 17:19:28.920]  it's happening the way it is
[17:19:28.920 --> 17:19:30.920]  and if the occupy movements
[17:19:30.920 --> 17:19:32.920]  fail something else
[17:19:32.920 --> 17:19:34.920]  is going to follow
[17:19:34.920 --> 17:19:36.920]  conditions are only going to get worse
[17:19:36.920 --> 17:19:38.920]  now there's no doubt
[17:19:38.920 --> 17:19:40.920]  we're in a depression and they've been covering it up
[17:19:40.920 --> 17:19:42.920]  and you were called the porn pessimist
[17:19:42.920 --> 17:19:44.920]  or pessimist porn and all this
[17:19:44.920 --> 17:19:46.920]  and the guys that were all wrong
[17:19:46.920 --> 17:19:48.920]  they're hailed because they were wrong
[17:19:48.920 --> 17:19:50.920]  because they played along with the
[17:19:50.920 --> 17:19:52.920]  delusion but my issue on violence
[17:19:52.920 --> 17:19:54.920]  is this I'm not looking for it
[17:19:54.920 --> 17:19:56.920]  it's not good
[17:19:56.920 --> 17:19:58.920]  offensively but
[17:19:58.920 --> 17:20:00.920]  the system pushing too hard
[17:20:00.920 --> 17:20:02.920]  and people
[17:20:02.920 --> 17:20:04.920]  resisting here and there
[17:20:04.920 --> 17:20:06.920]  in their own time
[17:20:06.920 --> 17:20:08.920]  that does scare the system and that's why
[17:20:08.920 --> 17:20:10.920]  they're trying to array all the surveillance
[17:20:10.920 --> 17:20:12.920]  and all this tracking so what
[17:20:12.920 --> 17:20:14.920]  of you surveillance I mean you just
[17:20:14.920 --> 17:20:16.920]  see the fist coming into your teeth
[17:20:16.920 --> 17:20:18.920]  so at a certain point
[17:20:18.920 --> 17:20:20.920]  it's not going to matter people are like
[17:20:20.920 --> 17:20:22.920]  oh you're on a list good put me on the top
[17:20:22.920 --> 17:20:24.920]  of it you know at a certain point
[17:20:24.920 --> 17:20:26.920]  their attempt as bullies to dominate us
[17:20:26.920 --> 17:20:28.920]  is only going to trigger the opposite response
[17:20:28.920 --> 17:20:30.920]  do you agree with that
[17:20:30.920 --> 17:20:32.920]  the other thing that's really changed the deal
[17:20:32.920 --> 17:20:34.920]  is that now we're
[17:20:34.920 --> 17:20:36.920]  watching them
[17:20:36.920 --> 17:20:38.920]  I mean when you see what goes on
[17:20:38.920 --> 17:20:40.920]  how many people are shooting
[17:20:40.920 --> 17:20:42.920]  footage of every
[17:20:42.920 --> 17:20:44.920]  movement so yeah
[17:20:44.920 --> 17:20:46.920]  you want to watch us we'll watch you
[17:20:46.920 --> 17:20:48.920]  and guess what there are more
[17:20:48.920 --> 17:20:50.920]  of us than there are you
[17:20:50.920 --> 17:20:52.920]  so this game works two ways
[17:20:52.920 --> 17:20:54.920]  and then the other issue becomes
[17:20:54.920 --> 17:20:56.920]  who are they
[17:20:56.920 --> 17:20:58.920]  you know what kind of sick minds
[17:20:58.920 --> 17:21:00.920]  are watching us all the time
[17:21:00.920 --> 17:21:02.920]  what kind of lives are they
[17:21:02.920 --> 17:21:04.920]  leading and are they
[17:21:04.920 --> 17:21:06.920]  afraid again
[17:21:06.920 --> 17:21:08.920]  you heard Eric kitty
[17:21:08.920 --> 17:21:10.920]  canter say
[17:21:10.920 --> 17:21:12.920]  that he was afraid
[17:21:12.920 --> 17:21:14.920]  of mob rule down in
[17:21:14.920 --> 17:21:16.920]  Wall Street oh you're
[17:21:16.920 --> 17:21:18.920]  afraid little kitty baby
[17:21:18.920 --> 17:21:20.920]  how about going down there yourself
[17:21:20.920 --> 17:21:22.920]  and walking through the
[17:21:22.920 --> 17:21:24.920]  crowds look they chase you know
[17:21:24.920 --> 17:21:26.920]  by the way I stopped going on a lot of
[17:21:26.920 --> 17:21:28.920]  the TV shows I've been turning
[17:21:28.920 --> 17:21:30.920]  them down I don't want to I don't want to
[17:21:30.920 --> 17:21:32.920]  be I'm picking and choosing
[17:21:32.920 --> 17:21:34.920]  what I want to do and I don't
[17:21:34.920 --> 17:21:36.920]  want to be along a lot of these shows
[17:21:36.920 --> 17:21:38.920]  to get in an argument with
[17:21:38.920 --> 17:21:40.920]  somebody because they want
[17:21:40.920 --> 17:21:42.920]  me to believe their ideology
[17:21:42.920 --> 17:21:44.920]  I don't tell anybody what to believe
[17:21:44.920 --> 17:21:46.920]  believe what you want but
[17:21:46.920 --> 17:21:48.920]  don't tell me I have to believe you're
[17:21:48.920 --> 17:21:50.920]  lying so when they say for example
[17:21:50.920 --> 17:21:52.920]  like a canter
[17:21:52.920 --> 17:21:54.920]  or a boner or a
[17:21:54.920 --> 17:21:56.920]  cane or the rest of them
[17:21:56.920 --> 17:21:58.920]  the people should go to Washington don't
[17:21:58.920 --> 17:22:00.920]  tell me what I should do so
[17:22:00.920 --> 17:22:02.920]  the point that I'm making Alex the
[17:22:02.920 --> 17:22:04.920]  future is in our hands
[17:22:04.920 --> 17:22:06.920]  and what they want you to
[17:22:06.920 --> 17:22:08.920]  believe is that you have no
[17:22:08.920 --> 17:22:10.920]  power they have no
[17:22:10.920 --> 17:22:12.920]  power the only thing
[17:22:12.920 --> 17:22:14.920]  that they have are a bunch of
[17:22:14.920 --> 17:22:16.920]  flunkies to fight for them
[17:22:16.920 --> 17:22:18.920]  well I agree with you I mean
[17:22:18.920 --> 17:22:20.920]  take police in 12 states
[17:22:20.920 --> 17:22:22.920]  arresting people that film in public
[17:22:22.920 --> 17:22:24.920]  even though the courts have all ruled
[17:22:24.920 --> 17:22:26.920]  it's constitutional to film somebody in public
[17:22:26.920 --> 17:22:28.920]  and record them but they still keep the
[17:22:28.920 --> 17:22:30.920]  arrest going in this desperate
[17:22:30.920 --> 17:22:32.920]  temper tantrum to say don't film
[17:22:32.920 --> 17:22:34.920]  us while they're surveilling us
[17:22:34.920 --> 17:22:36.920]  and it's only illustrating to people
[17:22:36.920 --> 17:22:38.920]  they wanted to put
[17:22:38.920 --> 17:22:40.920]  Mr. Allison
[17:22:40.920 --> 17:22:42.920]  life in prison for filming them
[17:22:42.920 --> 17:22:44.920]  in Illinois and
[17:22:44.920 --> 17:22:46.920]  the state attorney came down to the town
[17:22:46.920 --> 17:22:48.920]  and went
[17:22:48.920 --> 17:22:50.920]  before the judge and said yes we want life in prison
[17:22:50.920 --> 17:22:52.920]  we're
[17:22:52.920 --> 17:22:54.920]  giving an amicus brief in support
[17:22:54.920 --> 17:22:56.920]  of this county I mean they're really
[17:22:56.920 --> 17:22:58.920]  showing themselves you're like really
[17:22:58.920 --> 17:23:00.920]  you want to put a guy with no criminal
[17:23:00.920 --> 17:23:02.920]  record because he filmed the police who keep
[17:23:02.920 --> 17:23:04.920]  towing his cars from his
[17:23:04.920 --> 17:23:06.920]  repair shop business because the
[17:23:06.920 --> 17:23:08.920]  police chief's brother whatever's involved in the business
[17:23:08.920 --> 17:23:10.920]  or one of the top cops
[17:23:10.920 --> 17:23:12.920]  brother's involved in the towing company
[17:23:12.920 --> 17:23:14.920]  you really want to do this and they're like yeah
[17:23:14.920 --> 17:23:16.920]  we want life in prison I mean at a certain
[17:23:16.920 --> 17:23:18.920]  point it becomes so cartoon
[17:23:18.920 --> 17:23:20.920]  land and their attempt
[17:23:20.920 --> 17:23:22.920]  to intimidate us do they think
[17:23:22.920 --> 17:23:24.920]  with every phone with a camera now
[17:23:24.920 --> 17:23:26.920]  if cameras out the yin yang that
[17:23:26.920 --> 17:23:28.920]  this is going to intimidate us I mean
[17:23:28.920 --> 17:23:30.920]  what are they thinking the opposite
[17:23:30.920 --> 17:23:32.920]  is happening but it shows their disconnect
[17:23:32.920 --> 17:23:34.920]  Gerald yeah you know the other
[17:23:34.920 --> 17:23:36.920]  thing too I came to thought
[17:23:36.920 --> 17:23:38.920]  you know I'm of the
[17:23:38.920 --> 17:23:40.920]  the first wave of the baby boomers
[17:23:40.920 --> 17:23:42.920]  and the only reason the baby boomers
[17:23:42.920 --> 17:23:44.920]  protested so much in the
[17:23:44.920 --> 17:23:46.920]  1960s
[17:23:46.920 --> 17:23:48.920]  and early 70s was
[17:23:48.920 --> 17:23:50.920]  the draft the Vietnam War
[17:23:50.920 --> 17:23:52.920]  and the baby boomers
[17:23:52.920 --> 17:23:54.920]  have become
[17:23:54.920 --> 17:23:56.920]  a caricature
[17:23:56.920 --> 17:23:58.920]  of everything they said they hated
[17:23:58.920 --> 17:24:00.920]  they became
[17:24:00.920 --> 17:24:02.920]  the worst of what they claim
[17:24:02.920 --> 17:24:04.920]  they didn't want to happen
[17:24:04.920 --> 17:24:06.920]  they became the ultimate consumers
[17:24:06.920 --> 17:24:08.920]  they built the
[17:24:08.920 --> 17:24:10.920]  McMansions
[17:24:10.920 --> 17:24:12.920]  they waged wars
[17:24:12.920 --> 17:24:14.920]  they have done everything
[17:24:14.920 --> 17:24:16.920]  that they chastised
[17:24:16.920 --> 17:24:18.920]  their parents for
[17:24:18.920 --> 17:24:20.920]  they I remember that song
[17:24:20.920 --> 17:24:22.920]  you know I take the 815
[17:24:22.920 --> 17:24:24.920]  into the city and I get to work by 9
[17:24:24.920 --> 17:24:26.920]  815 to the city
[17:24:26.920 --> 17:24:28.920]  now the slaves are getting
[17:24:28.920 --> 17:24:30.920]  they're on the roads at 530 in the morning
[17:24:30.920 --> 17:24:32.920]  oh and the cat in the cradle
[17:24:32.920 --> 17:24:34.920]  the kid you know never saw his daddy
[17:24:34.920 --> 17:24:36.920]  daddy never showed up for the baseball game
[17:24:36.920 --> 17:24:38.920]  you know now mommy
[17:24:38.920 --> 17:24:40.920]  and daddy are both working
[17:24:40.920 --> 17:24:42.920]  and they shove the kid into a day care
[17:24:42.920 --> 17:24:44.920]  at 6 weeks old
[17:24:44.920 --> 17:24:46.920]  the baby boomers have
[17:24:46.920 --> 17:24:48.920]  given us the Gestapo
[17:24:48.920 --> 17:24:50.920]  society
[17:24:50.920 --> 17:24:52.920]  the baby boomers
[17:24:52.920 --> 17:24:54.920]  the Bill Clinton's
[17:24:54.920 --> 17:24:56.920]  the Hillary Clinton's
[17:24:56.920 --> 17:24:58.920]  these are the people
[17:24:58.920 --> 17:25:00.920]  that have raped us of our
[17:25:00.920 --> 17:25:02.920]  rights
[17:25:02.920 --> 17:25:04.920]  and they salute them
[17:25:04.920 --> 17:25:06.920]  and they've become them
[17:25:06.920 --> 17:25:08.920]  they become everything
[17:25:08.920 --> 17:25:10.920]  that they said they hated
[17:25:10.920 --> 17:25:12.920]  they want to go to a few calls and they've got to go soon
[17:25:12.920 --> 17:25:14.920]  but they have literally embraced hypocrisy
[17:25:14.920 --> 17:25:16.920]  the joke
[17:25:16.920 --> 17:25:18.920]  of giving a peace prize to Obama
[17:25:18.920 --> 17:25:20.920]  and now I saw a month ago
[17:25:20.920 --> 17:25:22.920]  they're talking about giving him another one
[17:25:22.920 --> 17:25:24.920]  they're saying all these wars that that's peace
[17:25:24.920 --> 17:25:26.920]  and so
[17:25:26.920 --> 17:25:28.920]  I mean it's again
[17:25:28.920 --> 17:25:30.920]  it's like you're trying to create
[17:25:30.920 --> 17:25:32.920]  a Alice in Wonderland scenario
[17:25:32.920 --> 17:25:34.920]  yeah
[17:25:34.920 --> 17:25:36.920]  again this is who these people are
[17:25:36.920 --> 17:25:38.920]  don't forget
[17:25:38.920 --> 17:25:40.920]  the people you hated in high school
[17:25:40.920 --> 17:25:42.920]  and college
[17:25:42.920 --> 17:25:44.920]  the class presidents the head of the student councils
[17:25:44.920 --> 17:25:46.920]  there they are
[17:25:46.920 --> 17:25:48.920]  and they're telling you now what to do
[17:25:48.920 --> 17:25:50.920]  incredible
[17:25:50.920 --> 17:25:52.920]  let's jam in a few calls here I don't want to abuse the time
[17:25:52.920 --> 17:25:54.920]  of Gerald Salente
[17:25:54.920 --> 17:25:56.920]  Bob in Chicago you're on the air
[17:25:56.920 --> 17:25:58.920]  thanks for holding go ahead
[17:25:58.920 --> 17:26:00.920]  hey Alex
[17:26:00.920 --> 17:26:02.920]  Gerald how's it going
[17:26:02.920 --> 17:26:04.920]  thank you brother what's on your mind
[17:26:04.920 --> 17:26:06.920]  hey I got a couple
[17:26:06.920 --> 17:26:08.920]  you know I think that
[17:26:08.920 --> 17:26:10.920]  the belly of the beast
[17:26:10.920 --> 17:26:12.920]  is the Federal Reserve would you agree
[17:26:12.920 --> 17:26:14.920]  yeah I'd say that's
[17:26:14.920 --> 17:26:16.920]  where these private banksters get this quasi-government power
[17:26:16.920 --> 17:26:18.920]  right
[17:26:18.920 --> 17:26:20.920]  belly of the beast because the beast has no heart
[17:26:22.920 --> 17:26:24.920]  and you know I try and communicate
[17:26:24.920 --> 17:26:26.920]  some of this stuff to people and they just look at me
[17:26:26.920 --> 17:26:28.920]  like a deer in the headlights
[17:26:28.920 --> 17:26:30.920]  like what
[17:26:30.920 --> 17:26:32.920]  yeah well don't feel bad a lot of people
[17:26:32.920 --> 17:26:34.920]  on the GMO on the fluoride all this
[17:26:34.920 --> 17:26:36.920]  France they watch TV all day
[17:26:36.920 --> 17:26:38.920]  they don't count it's always
[17:26:38.920 --> 17:26:40.920]  people who are awake on the side of good
[17:26:40.920 --> 17:26:42.920]  and evil that fight it out
[17:26:42.920 --> 17:26:44.920]  so don't get discouraged people that will wake up
[17:26:44.920 --> 17:26:46.920]  are waking up but zombies
[17:26:46.920 --> 17:26:48.920]  I mean you just got to feel sorry for them
[17:26:48.920 --> 17:26:50.920]  no yeah it's like my wife
[17:26:50.920 --> 17:26:52.920]  I try to tell my wife and she's like a deer in headlights
[17:26:52.920 --> 17:26:54.920]  and she says well what are you
[17:26:54.920 --> 17:26:56.920]  gonna do I said well you know
[17:26:56.920 --> 17:26:58.920]  look at me like a mustard seed
[17:26:58.920 --> 17:27:00.920]  you know it's a tiny little thing but you plant
[17:27:00.920 --> 17:27:02.920]  that seed and it grows awfully big
[17:27:02.920 --> 17:27:04.920]  so if I can just wake up a few
[17:27:04.920 --> 17:27:06.920]  people and they can wake up a few people
[17:27:06.920 --> 17:27:08.920]  and and that you know this thing
[17:27:08.920 --> 17:27:10.920]  could snowball well damn your wife
[17:27:10.920 --> 17:27:12.920]  proud that you're somebody who cares and
[17:27:12.920 --> 17:27:14.920]  is involved you know in every culture
[17:27:14.920 --> 17:27:16.920]  women always admired
[17:27:16.920 --> 17:27:18.920]  men that would stand up for people
[17:27:18.920 --> 17:27:20.920]  I mean I mean how do we lose
[17:27:20.920 --> 17:27:22.920]  that somehow in the last 50 years they
[17:27:22.920 --> 17:27:24.920]  with this fake feminism they like
[17:27:24.920 --> 17:27:26.920]  trained women that putting men down is
[17:27:26.920 --> 17:27:28.920]  just cool oh that men
[17:27:28.920 --> 17:27:30.920]  are idiots and all the sitcoms and dramas
[17:27:30.920 --> 17:27:32.920]  the men are all a bunch of knuckle dragging
[17:27:32.920 --> 17:27:34.920]  morons that's all conditioning
[17:27:34.920 --> 17:27:36.920]  let's get Gerald's comment on that
[17:27:36.920 --> 17:27:38.920]  well yeah I agree
[17:27:38.920 --> 17:27:40.920]  that you're about the mustard seed and
[17:27:40.920 --> 17:27:42.920]  everybody has to do something
[17:27:42.920 --> 17:27:44.920]  if you want it to change just do what
[17:27:44.920 --> 17:27:46.920]  you can do but try to do more than
[17:27:46.920 --> 17:27:48.920]  talk you know put your money where your
[17:27:48.920 --> 17:27:50.920]  mouth is and for all
[17:27:50.920 --> 17:27:52.920]  those people listening you know in this
[17:27:52.920 --> 17:27:54.920]  show today you know there are a lot of
[17:27:54.920 --> 17:27:56.920]  people like Alex out there
[17:27:56.920 --> 17:27:58.920]  that is doing I'm not you know blowing
[17:27:58.920 --> 17:28:00.920]  you know that that put his
[17:28:00.920 --> 17:28:02.920]  put his neck on the line and speaks up
[17:28:02.920 --> 17:28:04.920]  and takes a stand so not only
[17:28:04.920 --> 17:28:06.920]  put your money where your mouth is
[17:28:06.920 --> 17:28:08.920]  but do something yourself
[17:28:08.920 --> 17:28:10.920]  whether it's putting out a banner
[17:28:10.920 --> 17:28:12.920]  whether it is talking to other
[17:28:12.920 --> 17:28:14.920]  people whether it's going to
[17:28:14.920 --> 17:28:16.920]  meetings do something
[17:28:16.920 --> 17:28:18.920]  make your voice heard
[17:28:18.920 --> 17:28:20.920]  the only way this
[17:28:20.920 --> 17:28:22.920]  is going to change in my belief
[17:28:22.920 --> 17:28:24.920]  is that when people
[17:28:24.920 --> 17:28:26.920]  find the courage within them
[17:28:26.920 --> 17:28:28.920]  have respect
[17:28:28.920 --> 17:28:30.920]  for themselves and for others
[17:28:30.920 --> 17:28:32.920]  to have that passion
[17:28:32.920 --> 17:28:34.920]  that only they have
[17:28:34.920 --> 17:28:36.920]  and to stand up and make a
[17:28:36.920 --> 17:28:38.920]  statement and it is
[17:28:38.920 --> 17:28:40.920]  it's growing
[17:28:40.920 --> 17:28:42.920]  and it's non-stopping
[17:28:42.920 --> 17:28:44.920]  it's not going to stop it's not going to stop
[17:28:44.920 --> 17:28:46.920]  because it's not an intellectual exercise
[17:28:46.920 --> 17:28:48.920]  it's a gut issue
[17:28:48.920 --> 17:28:50.920]  an empty gut issue
[17:28:50.920 --> 17:28:52.920]  and people are losing everything
[17:28:52.920 --> 17:28:54.920]  the new poverty numbers came out
[17:28:54.920 --> 17:28:56.920]  you're astounding what is it
[17:28:56.920 --> 17:28:58.920]  one out of 15 people
[17:28:58.920 --> 17:29:00.920]  just think about it look around you
[17:29:00.920 --> 17:29:02.920]  look at 15 people
[17:29:02.920 --> 17:29:04.920]  one of them is living in
[17:29:04.920 --> 17:29:06.920]  dire poverty
[17:29:06.920 --> 17:29:08.920]  this is not what America is supposed to be
[17:29:08.920 --> 17:29:10.920]  we got close to 50 million now
[17:29:10.920 --> 17:29:12.920]  on food stamps which is an electronic
[17:29:12.920 --> 17:29:14.920]  soup kitchen
[17:29:14.920 --> 17:29:16.920]  we only got a few minutes left with
[17:29:16.920 --> 17:29:18.920]  Gerald and Gerald I know it's now 1030
[17:29:18.920 --> 17:29:20.920]  if you've got to go now I understand
[17:29:20.920 --> 17:29:22.920]  do we have time to take one or two more calls
[17:29:22.920 --> 17:29:24.920]  we could take one or two more
[17:29:24.920 --> 17:29:26.920]  okay Audra and then Adam and that's it
[17:29:26.920 --> 17:29:28.920]  and then I'll take the rest
[17:29:28.920 --> 17:29:30.920]  Gerald's got to go and get to work
[17:29:30.920 --> 17:29:32.920]  he isn't working right now but you know what I mean
[17:29:32.920 --> 17:29:34.920]  Audra and Dallas you're on the air and then Adam
[17:29:34.920 --> 17:29:36.920]  and Canada then I'll finish with the other folks
[17:29:36.920 --> 17:29:38.920]  go ahead Audra
[17:29:38.920 --> 17:29:40.920]  good morning I'm calling from Dallas
[17:29:40.920 --> 17:29:42.920]  I'm actually a land planner up here
[17:29:42.920 --> 17:29:44.920]  and my job is to understand all the codes
[17:29:44.920 --> 17:29:46.920]  and ordinances in the city of Dallas
[17:29:46.920 --> 17:29:48.920]  wow that's got to be hard
[17:29:48.920 --> 17:29:50.920]  it's paying the rear end
[17:29:50.920 --> 17:29:52.920]  my job is to hold the hands of these little
[17:29:52.920 --> 17:29:54.920]  mom and pops that bring their life savings
[17:29:54.920 --> 17:29:56.920]  to me and say I want to start a business
[17:29:56.920 --> 17:29:58.920]  and you know we talk about corruption
[17:29:58.920 --> 17:30:00.920]  on the federal level we talk about corruption
[17:30:00.920 --> 17:30:02.920]  on the state level it trickles downhill
[17:30:02.920 --> 17:30:04.920]  and I see these guys come in
[17:30:04.920 --> 17:30:06.920]  they've got all this money they get all these rules
[17:30:06.920 --> 17:30:08.920]  bent for them so they can come in and do
[17:30:08.920 --> 17:30:10.920]  these big developments and they put the screws
[17:30:10.920 --> 17:30:12.920]  to the mom and pops
[17:30:12.920 --> 17:30:14.920]  well yeah no no no I mean they tell
[17:30:14.920 --> 17:30:16.920]  inspectors I've talked to people in
[17:30:16.920 --> 17:30:18.920]  government it's come out they're told
[17:30:18.920 --> 17:30:20.920]  these little guys out you literally kiss
[17:30:20.920 --> 17:30:22.920]  the butt of the big guys so it's not just
[17:30:22.920 --> 17:30:24.920]  that the little guy doesn't get a fair shake
[17:30:24.920 --> 17:30:26.920]  the screws are put to them
[17:30:26.920 --> 17:30:28.920]  yeah the screws are
[17:30:28.920 --> 17:30:30.920]  put to them exactly and my job
[17:30:30.920 --> 17:30:32.920]  is to hold their hand and kind of walk them through
[17:30:32.920 --> 17:30:34.920]  that process because when you go to open
[17:30:34.920 --> 17:30:36.920]  a business here you have to go through zoning
[17:30:36.920 --> 17:30:38.920]  and planning and permitting and things of that nature
[17:30:38.920 --> 17:30:40.920]  it's Greek to most folks they have no idea
[17:30:40.920 --> 17:30:42.920]  what you're talking about so it's my job
[17:30:42.920 --> 17:30:44.920]  to go in there and decipher all that information
[17:30:44.920 --> 17:30:46.920]  put all that stuff together and I live
[17:30:46.920 --> 17:30:48.920]  for that five minutes of elation
[17:30:48.920 --> 17:30:50.920]  at the end of that long process
[17:30:50.920 --> 17:30:52.920]  when they get those keys in their hand
[17:30:52.920 --> 17:30:54.920]  and they get to go open that business
[17:30:54.920 --> 17:30:56.920]  and then it kills me two years later
[17:30:56.920 --> 17:30:58.920]  when I see that same business I help open
[17:30:58.920 --> 17:31:00.920]  close because people don't realize
[17:31:00.920 --> 17:31:02.920]  how entrepreneurs and small
[17:31:02.920 --> 17:31:04.920]  businesses are under attack here's an example
[17:31:04.920 --> 17:31:06.920]  my lawyer Eric Todd great guy
[17:31:06.920 --> 17:31:08.920]  a patriot here in Austin they have
[17:31:08.920 --> 17:31:10.920]  a Trudy's restaurant down on Congress
[17:31:10.920 --> 17:31:12.920]  they gave him the permit to build this $150,000
[17:31:12.920 --> 17:31:14.920]  deck all the way around it and
[17:31:14.920 --> 17:31:16.920]  the city comes when it's done and said
[17:31:16.920 --> 17:31:18.920]  we're revoking it for no reason
[17:31:18.920 --> 17:31:20.920]  and literally now my lawyer fights
[17:31:20.920 --> 17:31:22.920]  these people all day long he says
[17:31:22.920 --> 17:31:24.920]  and I've seen it myself
[17:31:24.920 --> 17:31:26.920]  they literally like out of a movie
[17:31:26.920 --> 17:31:28.920]  come to families people
[17:31:28.920 --> 17:31:30.920]  building something on their house whatever
[17:31:30.920 --> 17:31:32.920]  and literally talk to them like they're trash
[17:31:32.920 --> 17:31:34.920]  and let them know you're scum
[17:31:34.920 --> 17:31:36.920]  and literally are on power trips
[17:31:36.920 --> 17:31:38.920]  and I mean and I've run into
[17:31:38.920 --> 17:31:40.920]  some of these bureaucrats I mean these are the
[17:31:40.920 --> 17:31:42.920]  lowest form of trash
[17:31:42.920 --> 17:31:44.920]  they enjoy power tripping
[17:31:44.920 --> 17:31:46.920]  and they won't even give
[17:31:46.920 --> 17:31:48.920]  little businesses permits in many cases
[17:31:48.920 --> 17:31:50.920]  and they tell you
[17:31:50.920 --> 17:31:52.920]  they say we don't want your little businesses here
[17:31:52.920 --> 17:31:54.920]  I mean these are the scum
[17:31:54.920 --> 17:31:56.920]  of the earth what's wrong with these people Gerald
[17:31:56.920 --> 17:31:58.920]  well again you know
[17:31:58.920 --> 17:32:00.920]  there are a lot of people out there that have no idea
[17:32:00.920 --> 17:32:02.920]  what life used to be like in this country
[17:32:02.920 --> 17:32:04.920]  you remember when you used to
[17:32:04.920 --> 17:32:06.920]  go to the local drugstore
[17:32:06.920 --> 17:32:08.920]  you don't need them we have
[17:32:08.920 --> 17:32:10.920]  CVS and we have right-aid
[17:32:10.920 --> 17:32:12.920]  and Walgreens
[17:32:12.920 --> 17:32:14.920]  become a little slave for us
[17:32:14.920 --> 17:32:16.920]  why should you own your own store
[17:32:16.920 --> 17:32:18.920]  when we could control everything
[17:32:18.920 --> 17:32:20.920]  Walmart
[17:32:20.920 --> 17:32:22.920]  Walmart has
[17:32:22.920 --> 17:32:24.920]  10%
[17:32:24.920 --> 17:32:26.920]  of all the retail action
[17:32:26.920 --> 17:32:28.920]  why should anybody else
[17:32:28.920 --> 17:32:30.920]  sell anything
[17:32:30.920 --> 17:32:32.920]  home goods
[17:32:32.920 --> 17:32:34.920]  home depots
[17:32:34.920 --> 17:32:36.920]  why should you have a hardware store
[17:32:36.920 --> 17:32:38.920]  when we could own everything
[17:32:38.920 --> 17:32:40.920]  why should you have
[17:32:40.920 --> 17:32:42.920]  local banks
[17:32:42.920 --> 17:32:44.920]  when we could own everything
[17:32:44.920 --> 17:32:46.920]  the two big to fail banks by the way
[17:32:46.920 --> 17:32:48.920]  they became 20%
[17:32:48.920 --> 17:32:50.920]  bigger
[17:32:50.920 --> 17:32:52.920]  the game is rigged
[17:32:52.920 --> 17:32:54.920]  the multinationals are running
[17:32:54.920 --> 17:32:56.920]  our lives and now
[17:32:56.920 --> 17:32:58.920]  watch out here comes a new one
[17:32:58.920 --> 17:33:00.920]  everybody
[17:33:00.920 --> 17:33:02.920]  the rich Chinese
[17:33:02.920 --> 17:33:04.920]  are bailing out of China
[17:33:04.920 --> 17:33:06.920]  with all their dough
[17:33:06.920 --> 17:33:08.920]  and they're coming over here
[17:33:08.920 --> 17:33:10.920]  and buying up the good
[17:33:10.920 --> 17:33:12.920]  new old USA
[17:33:12.920 --> 17:33:14.920]  so the multinational
[17:33:14.920 --> 17:33:16.920]  face is going to have
[17:33:16.920 --> 17:33:18.920]  even a new complexion on it
[17:33:18.920 --> 17:33:20.920]  well expanding on that
[17:33:20.920 --> 17:33:22.920]  the red dawn they did a remake
[17:33:22.920 --> 17:33:24.920]  where it's the communist Chinese takeover
[17:33:24.920 --> 17:33:26.920]  and the Chinese put pressure on Hollywood
[17:33:26.920 --> 17:33:28.920]  and they went in for millions of dollars
[17:33:28.920 --> 17:33:30.920]  and digitally erased
[17:33:30.920 --> 17:33:32.920]  all of the
[17:33:32.920 --> 17:33:34.920]  I guess Chinese people
[17:33:34.920 --> 17:33:36.920]  can remove the arm bands
[17:33:36.920 --> 17:33:38.920]  and things digitally
[17:33:38.920 --> 17:33:40.920]  and turn it into basically a cartoon
[17:33:40.920 --> 17:33:42.920]  because the Chinese said you don't
[17:33:42.920 --> 17:33:44.920]  show that in America
[17:33:44.920 --> 17:33:46.920]  now the Chinese government
[17:33:46.920 --> 17:33:48.920]  that killed 80 something million of their own people
[17:33:48.920 --> 17:33:50.920]  they dictate
[17:33:50.920 --> 17:33:52.920]  what Americans can make
[17:33:52.920 --> 17:33:54.920]  and again
[17:33:54.920 --> 17:33:56.920]  thank Bill Clinton all you
[17:33:56.920 --> 17:33:58.920]  with the crats
[17:33:58.920 --> 17:34:00.920]  and all you people out there
[17:34:00.920 --> 17:34:02.920]  you liberals that say
[17:34:02.920 --> 17:34:04.920]  you can only do so much
[17:34:04.920 --> 17:34:06.920]  they started that war in Libya just like that
[17:34:06.920 --> 17:34:08.920]  didn't they
[17:34:08.920 --> 17:34:10.920]  so they gave the country away with NAFTA
[17:34:10.920 --> 17:34:12.920]  they gave the country away
[17:34:12.920 --> 17:34:14.920]  with the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act
[17:34:14.920 --> 17:34:16.920]  that allowed the bankers to become these
[17:34:16.920 --> 17:34:18.920]  bandits these
[17:34:18.920 --> 17:34:20.920]  ideally rec casinos
[17:34:20.920 --> 17:34:22.920]  that keep losing money and we have to cover their bets
[17:34:22.920 --> 17:34:24.920]  they killed the country
[17:34:24.920 --> 17:34:26.920]  when they repealed
[17:34:26.920 --> 17:34:28.920]  and gutted the Robertson-Patman Act
[17:34:28.920 --> 17:34:30.920]  and the Sherman Antitrust Act
[17:34:30.920 --> 17:34:32.920]  remember when there used to be radio stations
[17:34:32.920 --> 17:34:34.920]  that weren't owned by Clear Channel
[17:34:34.920 --> 17:34:36.920]  I mean come on
[17:34:36.920 --> 17:34:38.920]  in every sector
[17:34:38.920 --> 17:34:40.920]  agriculture, communications
[17:34:40.920 --> 17:34:42.920]  pharmaceuticals, retail
[17:34:42.920 --> 17:34:44.920]  a couple of people own everything
[17:34:44.920 --> 17:34:46.920]  break the chains
[17:34:46.920 --> 17:34:48.920]  or else you're going to die
[17:34:48.920 --> 17:34:50.920]  with those chains on
[17:34:50.920 --> 17:34:52.920]  as you lived with them
[17:34:52.920 --> 17:34:54.920]  alright, Audrey
[17:34:54.920 --> 17:34:56.920]  thank you so much for the call
[17:34:56.920 --> 17:34:58.920]  did you want to add anything else
[17:34:58.920 --> 17:35:00.920]  yeah, I'm just going to
[17:35:00.920 --> 17:35:02.920]  just one brief thing, I've been watching this thing with Greece
[17:35:02.920 --> 17:35:04.920]  because I think however Greece goes
[17:35:04.920 --> 17:35:06.920]  so goes the rest of the world
[17:35:06.920 --> 17:35:08.920]  what did y'all have a comment about
[17:35:08.920 --> 17:35:10.920]  the Greek Prime Minister agreeing to step down
[17:35:10.920 --> 17:35:12.920]  well, it's nothing
[17:35:12.920 --> 17:35:14.920]  just another criminal step in
[17:35:14.920 --> 17:35:16.920]  the big news to watch
[17:35:16.920 --> 17:35:18.920]  first of all, Greece is a tiny
[17:35:18.920 --> 17:35:20.920]  little nothing country
[17:35:20.920 --> 17:35:22.920]  and they're making a big deal out of it
[17:35:22.920 --> 17:35:24.920]  because it's like
[17:35:24.920 --> 17:35:26.920]  if the banks fail
[17:35:26.920 --> 17:35:28.920]  they're all going to die
[17:35:28.920 --> 17:35:30.920]  kind of situation
[17:35:30.920 --> 17:35:32.920]  the whole system
[17:35:32.920 --> 17:35:34.920]  is collapsing
[17:35:34.920 --> 17:35:36.920]  and they're looking for a scapegoat
[17:35:36.920 --> 17:35:38.920]  the big news about Greece
[17:35:38.920 --> 17:35:40.920]  is that the cradle
[17:35:40.920 --> 17:35:42.920]  of democracy
[17:35:42.920 --> 17:35:44.920]  was robbed by the banks
[17:35:44.920 --> 17:35:46.920]  the politicians and the bureaucrats
[17:35:46.920 --> 17:35:48.920]  they won't let the people
[17:35:48.920 --> 17:35:50.920]  vote on austerity
[17:35:50.920 --> 17:35:52.920]  that should be the headline news
[17:35:52.920 --> 17:35:54.920]  and you're absolutely right
[17:35:54.920 --> 17:35:56.920]  Greece's debt is supposedly
[17:35:56.920 --> 17:35:58.920]  100 billion
[17:35:58.920 --> 17:36:00.920]  and they made some of the
[17:36:00.920 --> 17:36:02.920]  bondholders take a haircut
[17:36:02.920 --> 17:36:04.920]  but then they gave them 1.4 trillion
[17:36:04.920 --> 17:36:06.920]  that's the Euro package
[17:36:06.920 --> 17:36:08.920]  leverage they're saying to 5 trillion
[17:36:08.920 --> 17:36:10.920]  so they're all being told it's Greece
[17:36:10.920 --> 17:36:12.920]  for 100 billion but they've got 5 trillion
[17:36:12.920 --> 17:36:14.920]  this is all about a Euro
[17:36:14.920 --> 17:36:16.920]  power grab, one more call we're going to let Gerald go
[17:36:16.920 --> 17:36:18.920]  very honored to have him today
[17:36:18.920 --> 17:36:20.920]  spending so much time with us
[17:36:20.920 --> 17:36:22.920]  Adam in Canada, you're on the year
[17:36:22.920 --> 17:36:24.920]  go ahead
[17:36:24.920 --> 17:36:26.920]  hi Alex and Gerald, thanks for having me on
[17:36:26.920 --> 17:36:28.920]  I spoke to you guys last year
[17:36:28.920 --> 17:36:30.920]  during the money bomb
[17:36:30.920 --> 17:36:32.920]  a little background, I'm the director of IT
[17:36:32.920 --> 17:36:34.920]  for a software company that builds
[17:36:34.920 --> 17:36:36.920]  transactional software for credit card companies
[17:36:36.920 --> 17:36:38.920]  and I don't have a bank account or any plastic
[17:36:38.920 --> 17:36:40.920]  I also
[17:36:40.920 --> 17:36:42.920]  wanted to recommend a book
[17:36:42.920 --> 17:36:44.920]  the day after World War 3
[17:36:44.920 --> 17:36:46.920]  the US government plans for surviving a nuclear war
[17:36:46.920 --> 17:36:48.920]  by Edward Zuckerman
[17:36:48.920 --> 17:36:50.920]  I believe the first printing was in 1979
[17:36:50.920 --> 17:36:52.920]  but woke me up back in the 80s
[17:36:52.920 --> 17:36:54.920]  I'd like to ask you the same question
[17:36:54.920 --> 17:36:56.920]  Gerald, as I did last year
[17:36:56.920 --> 17:36:58.920]  if that's okay
[17:36:58.920 --> 17:37:00.920]  I plan on taking off on a boat
[17:37:00.920 --> 17:37:02.920]  in the international waters when the worst
[17:37:02.920 --> 17:37:04.920]  of the crash really hits
[17:37:04.920 --> 17:37:06.920]  how long do you think we have
[17:37:06.920 --> 17:37:08.920]  it's hard to tell
[17:37:08.920 --> 17:37:10.920]  because they keep coming up with these
[17:37:10.920 --> 17:37:12.920]  schemes to keep it going
[17:37:12.920 --> 17:37:14.920]  they call it kicking the can down the road
[17:37:14.920 --> 17:37:16.920]  it's not good
[17:37:16.920 --> 17:37:18.920]  it's keeping the Ponzi scheme going
[17:37:18.920 --> 17:37:20.920]  so for example, we only found out recently
[17:37:20.920 --> 17:37:22.920]  about the Federal Reserve
[17:37:22.920 --> 17:37:24.920]  pumping in $16.5 trillion
[17:37:24.920 --> 17:37:26.920]  that we didn't know about
[17:37:26.920 --> 17:37:28.920]  we don't know what they're going to be doing
[17:37:28.920 --> 17:37:30.920]  over the G20 to keep it going
[17:37:30.920 --> 17:37:32.920]  so until
[17:37:32.920 --> 17:37:34.920]  there is a real big
[17:37:34.920 --> 17:37:36.920]  crash
[17:37:36.920 --> 17:37:38.920]  then you're not going to know
[17:37:38.920 --> 17:37:40.920]  because they're going to keep it
[17:37:40.920 --> 17:37:42.920]  they're going to keep it secret
[17:37:42.920 --> 17:37:44.920]  as they have been doing it
[17:37:44.920 --> 17:37:46.920]  to try to make it seem
[17:37:46.920 --> 17:37:48.920]  like there's some kind of recovery
[17:37:48.920 --> 17:37:50.920]  of stability
[17:37:50.920 --> 17:37:52.920]  but I would venture to say that
[17:37:52.920 --> 17:37:54.920]  this year should be
[17:37:54.920 --> 17:37:56.920]  the telling year, 2012
[17:37:56.920 --> 17:37:58.920]  anything else, sir?
[17:37:58.920 --> 17:38:00.920]  well, so what do you think is going to be
[17:38:00.920 --> 17:38:02.920]  a pretty dramatic
[17:38:02.920 --> 17:38:04.920]  conclusion to the situation then
[17:38:04.920 --> 17:38:06.920]  it's not going to be a slow decline?
[17:38:06.920 --> 17:38:08.920]  oh no, it's dramatic
[17:38:08.920 --> 17:38:10.920]  they're just holding it up
[17:38:10.920 --> 17:38:12.920]  they're propping it up with all this phony money
[17:38:12.920 --> 17:38:14.920]  no, this thing is teetering
[17:38:14.920 --> 17:38:16.920]  it's going to be dramatic
[17:38:16.920 --> 17:38:18.920]  and it's, oh, you talk about Greece
[17:38:18.920 --> 17:38:20.920]  the other caller
[17:38:20.920 --> 17:38:22.920]  in between the break
[17:38:22.920 --> 17:38:24.920]  I was going over the news
[17:38:24.920 --> 17:38:26.920]  Italy's bringing in the IMF
[17:38:26.920 --> 17:38:28.920]  now to monitor the situation
[17:38:28.920 --> 17:38:30.920]  bringing in the IMF
[17:38:30.920 --> 17:38:32.920]  you mean the International
[17:38:32.920 --> 17:38:34.920]  Mafia Federation
[17:38:34.920 --> 17:38:36.920]  the loan sharks the last resort
[17:38:36.920 --> 17:38:38.920]  so the thing is collapsing
[17:38:38.920 --> 17:38:40.920]  and so they're trying to pull it out
[17:38:40.920 --> 17:38:42.920]  at every level
[17:38:42.920 --> 17:38:44.920]  well, that's right and meanwhile
[17:38:44.920 --> 17:38:46.920]  governments everywhere are scurrying around
[17:38:46.920 --> 17:38:48.920]  like the end of the world's coming
[17:38:48.920 --> 17:38:50.920]  bunkers, weapons
[17:38:50.920 --> 17:38:52.920]  emergency media takeover
[17:38:52.920 --> 17:38:54.920]  surveillance
[17:38:54.920 --> 17:38:56.920]  these crooks know that they overcook the turkey
[17:38:56.920 --> 17:38:58.920]  they wanted to rob stuff
[17:38:58.920 --> 17:39:00.920]  but they've done such a good job
[17:39:00.920 --> 17:39:02.920]  that they realize their own system's blown
[17:39:02.920 --> 17:39:04.920]  when they are running around
[17:39:04.920 --> 17:39:06.920]  arming to the teeth
[17:39:06.920 --> 17:39:08.920]  getting all their people ready
[17:39:08.920 --> 17:39:10.920]  and when the stuff really hits the fan
[17:39:10.920 --> 17:39:12.920]  and
[17:39:12.920 --> 17:39:14.920]  as society breaks down, I think Gerald's right
[17:39:14.920 --> 17:39:16.920]  I've moved to the country
[17:39:16.920 --> 17:39:18.920]  I've started really getting ready
[17:39:18.920 --> 17:39:20.920]  and also mentally ready
[17:39:20.920 --> 17:39:22.920]  because this thing just runs from bad to worse
[17:39:22.920 --> 17:39:24.920]  Adam, I appreciate your call
[17:39:24.920 --> 17:39:26.920]  we're going to let Gerald go here in a moment
[17:39:26.920 --> 17:39:28.920]  then I'll come back after a break
[17:39:28.920 --> 17:39:30.920]  and take the rest of your calls
[17:39:30.920 --> 17:39:32.920]  and by the way, Jesse Ventura called me last night
[17:39:32.920 --> 17:39:34.920]  either before his press conference or after
[17:39:34.920 --> 17:39:36.920]  today
[17:39:36.920 --> 17:39:38.920]  when he called me last night
[17:39:38.920 --> 17:39:40.920]  on my cell phone, of course, I didn't keep it
[17:39:40.920 --> 17:39:42.920]  when she gave it to me on a lawsuit or something
[17:39:42.920 --> 17:39:44.920]  he's going to be calling my cell
[17:39:44.920 --> 17:39:46.920]  or calling the hotline later, so who knows
[17:39:46.920 --> 17:39:48.920]  with that breaking news, with the whole TSA
[17:39:48.920 --> 17:39:50.920]  his case being thrown out
[17:39:50.920 --> 17:39:52.920]  they say he alleges he was groped
[17:39:52.920 --> 17:39:54.920]  it's funny
[17:39:54.920 --> 17:39:56.920]  they actually mentioned one of the flights I was on
[17:39:56.920 --> 17:39:58.920]  in the lawsuit with him
[17:39:58.920 --> 17:40:00.920]  where they did like this five minute groping
[17:40:00.920 --> 17:40:02.920]  and they were all laughing, they knew he was a celebrity
[17:40:02.920 --> 17:40:04.920]  and it was like a big celebration with the TSA people
[17:40:04.920 --> 17:40:06.920]  running around like
[17:40:06.920 --> 17:40:08.920]  police or something
[17:40:08.920 --> 17:40:10.920]  or pygmies, so that's coming up
[17:40:10.920 --> 17:40:12.920]  Gerald, thank you so much
[17:40:12.920 --> 17:40:14.920]  for spending this time with us
[17:40:14.920 --> 17:40:16.920]  tell folks how they can subscribe
[17:40:16.920 --> 17:40:18.920]  to the Trends Journal
[17:40:18.920 --> 17:40:20.920]  if they're not online
[17:40:20.920 --> 17:40:22.920]  TrendsJournal.com
[17:40:22.920 --> 17:40:24.920]  the autumn issue just went out
[17:40:24.920 --> 17:40:26.920]  40 pages of art
[17:40:26.920 --> 17:40:28.920]  illustration and
[17:40:28.920 --> 17:40:30.920]  information that's going to help you prepare
[17:40:30.920 --> 17:40:32.920]  survive and prevail
[17:40:32.920 --> 17:40:34.920]  these coming times
[17:40:34.920 --> 17:40:36.920]  and also the other project
[17:40:36.920 --> 17:40:38.920]  I'm working on
[17:40:38.920 --> 17:40:40.920]  DirectDemocracyNow.org
[17:40:40.920 --> 17:40:42.920]  O-R-G
[17:40:42.920 --> 17:40:44.920]  and to put the people's vote back
[17:40:44.920 --> 17:40:46.920]  to put democracy
[17:40:46.920 --> 17:40:48.920]  into play and break the
[17:40:48.920 --> 17:40:50.920]  rule of the gang of 535
[17:40:50.920 --> 17:40:52.920]  that's telling us how to live
[17:40:52.920 --> 17:40:54.920]  so thank you for all
[17:40:54.920 --> 17:40:56.920]  you are doing Alex
[17:40:56.920 --> 17:40:58.920]  and for having me on your show
[17:40:58.920 --> 17:41:00.920]  I very much appreciate it
[17:41:00.920 --> 17:41:02.920]  well thank you sir, we really appreciate your support
[17:41:02.920 --> 17:41:04.920]  and your time, I know you're a very busy man
[17:41:04.920 --> 17:41:06.920]  I don't do a lot of media that you requested
[17:41:06.920 --> 17:41:08.920]  so Gerald, thank you so much
[17:41:08.920 --> 17:41:10.920]  and it was great seeing you up in New York
[17:41:10.920 --> 17:41:12.920]  there goes Gerald Salente
[17:41:12.920 --> 17:41:14.920]  spent an hour and 40 minutes with us or so
[17:41:14.920 --> 17:41:16.920]  I know we got William C.T.
[17:41:16.920 --> 17:41:18.920]  Sean, Eric, Jason and others
[17:41:18.920 --> 17:41:20.920]  I'm going to play what they call
[17:41:20.920 --> 17:41:22.920]  the Talksport Mega Rant
[17:41:22.920 --> 17:41:24.920]  where I was yelling and screaming at some idiot
[17:41:24.920 --> 17:41:26.920]  on British Radio a few months ago
[17:41:26.920 --> 17:41:28.920]  with their national channel
[17:41:28.920 --> 17:41:30.920]  so we're going to play that
[17:41:30.920 --> 17:41:32.920]  and then we're going to take some local breakfast tacos
[17:41:32.920 --> 17:41:34.920]  potato, egg and cheese
[17:41:34.920 --> 17:41:36.920]  delicioso
[17:41:36.920 --> 17:41:38.920]  so we're going to go to this
[17:41:38.920 --> 17:41:40.920]  our rant, this is commercial free basically
[17:41:40.920 --> 17:41:42.920]  and
[17:41:42.920 --> 17:41:44.920]  then we're going to come back and take your calls
[17:41:44.920 --> 17:41:46.920]  and then we got a bunch of other guests coming up today
[17:41:46.920 --> 17:41:48.920]  as well
[17:41:48.920 --> 17:41:50.920]  Alan Watt
[17:41:50.920 --> 17:41:52.920]  Jim Mars, Bob Chapman
[17:41:52.920 --> 17:41:54.920]  wow, it's hard to believe we've already gone through
[17:41:54.920 --> 17:41:56.920]  most of this list
[17:41:56.920 --> 17:41:58.920]  Joel Scowles and Webster Tarbley
[17:41:58.920 --> 17:42:00.920]  Albrecht, George Norrie, David Ike
[17:42:00.920 --> 17:42:02.920]  Mike Adams and all those guests he had on
[17:42:02.920 --> 17:42:04.920]  Alfred Adas, Tex Mars
[17:42:04.920 --> 17:42:06.920]  James Corbett
[17:42:06.920 --> 17:42:08.920]  Fritz Springmeyer
[17:42:08.920 --> 17:42:10.920]  Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson and a bunch of guests
[17:42:10.920 --> 17:42:12.920]  Richard Reeves, did Reeves come in and do an hour?
[17:42:12.920 --> 17:42:14.920]  That's when I went to sleep
[17:42:14.920 --> 17:42:16.920]  and
[17:42:16.920 --> 17:42:18.920]  then the Scullum Bones premiere video
[17:42:18.920 --> 17:42:20.920]  that was incredible, Gerald Salente
[17:42:20.920 --> 17:42:22.920]  you just saw that and Alan Watt, Mars
[17:42:22.920 --> 17:42:24.920]  Chapman coming up and Ventura
[17:42:24.920 --> 17:42:26.920]  if it happens
[17:42:26.920 --> 17:42:28.920]  he said when the ruling comes out, I'll come on your show
[17:42:28.920 --> 17:42:30.920]  first after the press conference and
[17:42:30.920 --> 17:42:32.920]  ring a ding, you know, I'm on air while
[17:42:32.920 --> 17:42:34.920]  whoever was on
[17:42:34.920 --> 17:42:36.920]  when that happened, I guess it was a desk
[17:42:36.920 --> 17:42:38.920]  and that's just bizarre
[17:42:38.920 --> 17:42:40.920]  my entire life is beyond weirdness
[17:42:40.920 --> 17:42:42.920]  I guess reality is weird, reality is crazy
[17:42:42.920 --> 17:42:44.920]  reality is cool, not all this fake stuff
[17:42:44.920 --> 17:42:46.920]  where, you know, it's this fiction TV
[17:42:46.920 --> 17:42:48.920]  and all this garbage
[17:42:48.920 --> 17:42:50.920]  the real world is just beyond
[17:42:50.920 --> 17:42:52.920]  bizarre
[17:42:52.920 --> 17:42:54.920]  okay, we're going to go to this rant
[17:42:54.920 --> 17:42:56.920]  by the way, I cannot say enough about the crew
[17:42:56.920 --> 17:42:58.920]  oh, we're here because of the money bomb
[17:42:58.920 --> 17:43:00.920]  if you want to donate, it's infowarsmoneybomb.com
[17:43:00.920 --> 17:43:02.920]  or infowars.com
[17:43:02.920 --> 17:43:04.920]  you can spread the
[17:43:04.920 --> 17:43:06.920]  video link around everybody, it's Friday
[17:43:06.920 --> 17:43:08.920]  too, I haven't asked the IT folks who haven't slept
[17:43:08.920 --> 17:43:10.920]  what a crew
[17:43:10.920 --> 17:43:12.920]  I went to bed for a couple hours, someone's around here
[17:43:12.920 --> 17:43:14.920]  haven't slept
[17:43:14.920 --> 17:43:16.920]  but
[17:43:16.920 --> 17:43:18.920]  are we going to re-air the video at prisonplanet.tv
[17:43:18.920 --> 17:43:20.920]  on the free streams
[17:43:20.920 --> 17:43:22.920]  for everybody when the show ends at 2 o'clock today
[17:43:22.920 --> 17:43:24.920]  we're going to re-air the 27 hours again
[17:43:24.920 --> 17:43:26.920]  or chunks of it
[17:43:26.920 --> 17:43:28.920]  because normally we re-air the radio show
[17:43:28.920 --> 17:43:30.920]  restreams
[17:43:30.920 --> 17:43:32.920]  and we have the nightly news and that restreams for folks
[17:43:32.920 --> 17:43:34.920]  in this archive after we first air it
[17:43:34.920 --> 17:43:36.920]  but what are we doing at 2 o'clock
[17:43:36.920 --> 17:43:38.920]  when the show's over
[17:43:38.920 --> 17:43:40.920]  you shut it down long enough to start the restreams
[17:43:40.920 --> 17:43:42.920]  and move it all the way
[17:43:42.920 --> 17:43:44.920]  they'll shut it down, let the servers cool off
[17:43:44.920 --> 17:43:46.920]  and get everything in line at 2 o'clock
[17:43:48.920 --> 17:43:50.920]  I guess because
[17:43:50.920 --> 17:43:52.920]  we'll shut them down for about 10-15 minutes
[17:43:52.920 --> 17:43:54.920]  and then we'll restream the entire thing
[17:43:54.920 --> 17:43:56.920]  so there will be radio silence
[17:43:56.920 --> 17:43:58.920]  at 2 o'clock central today
[17:44:00.920 --> 17:44:02.920]  and then we will
[17:44:02.920 --> 17:44:04.920]  Alex Jones reporting from
[17:44:04.920 --> 17:44:06.920]  insane asylum earth
[17:44:06.920 --> 17:44:08.920]  I'm
[17:44:08.920 --> 17:44:10.920]  living here with a
[17:44:10.920 --> 17:44:12.920]  group of people who want freedom
[17:44:12.920 --> 17:44:14.920]  the planet's been overtaken by
[17:44:14.920 --> 17:44:16.920]  preening
[17:44:16.920 --> 17:44:18.920]  demonic peacocks who
[17:44:18.920 --> 17:44:20.920]  endlessly seek for
[17:44:20.920 --> 17:44:22.920]  power trinkets
[17:44:22.920 --> 17:44:24.920]  and golden tinfoil to festoon their
[17:44:24.920 --> 17:44:26.920]  beaks with
[17:44:26.920 --> 17:44:28.920]  I'm watching them decimate the planet
[17:44:28.920 --> 17:44:30.920]  and release biological plagues upon themselves
[17:44:30.920 --> 17:44:32.920]  while they gibber like
[17:44:32.920 --> 17:44:34.920]  demonic monkey goblins
[17:44:34.920 --> 17:44:36.920]  I'm not sure but
[17:44:36.920 --> 17:44:38.920]  I certainly understand that
[17:44:38.920 --> 17:44:40.920]  we're entering the twilight zone here
[17:44:40.920 --> 17:44:42.920]  Jerron likes what I just said
[17:44:42.920 --> 17:44:44.920]  it's all true
[17:44:44.920 --> 17:44:46.920]  so I'll continue from insane asylum earth
[17:44:46.920 --> 17:44:48.920]  maybe one of those last sane people alive
[17:44:48.920 --> 17:44:50.920]  with you as well
[17:44:50.920 --> 17:44:52.920]  but in the kingdom
[17:44:52.920 --> 17:44:54.920]  of insane people the sane are insane
[17:44:56.920 --> 17:44:58.920]  I guess to the Aztecs I would be insane
[17:44:58.920 --> 17:45:00.920]  don't kill your child the winged serpent
[17:45:00.920 --> 17:45:02.920]  doesn't exist it's like the easter bunny
[17:45:02.920 --> 17:45:04.920]  they'd say easter what? bunny what?
[17:45:04.920 --> 17:45:06.920]  we'll be right back
[17:45:06.920 --> 17:45:08.920]  after this transmission
[17:45:08.920 --> 17:45:10.920]  after this rant with your call stay with us
[17:45:12.920 --> 17:45:14.920]  and Alex if it's alright with you
[17:45:14.920 --> 17:45:16.920]  I want to get into the Obama birth certificate
[17:45:16.920 --> 17:45:18.920]  in a second but let's just take a couple of calls here
[17:45:18.920 --> 17:45:20.920]  Pervais is in Rothstein
[17:45:20.920 --> 17:45:22.920]  Pervais what do you want to say?
[17:45:22.920 --> 17:45:24.920]  good evening sir
[17:45:24.920 --> 17:45:26.920]  I'm so proud of Alex
[17:45:26.920 --> 17:45:28.920]  the gentleman speaks so loudly
[17:45:28.920 --> 17:45:30.920]  and speaks so truthfully
[17:45:30.920 --> 17:45:32.920]  I was coming back from from Kenya originally
[17:45:32.920 --> 17:45:34.920]  and I came to him as a 12 year old child
[17:45:34.920 --> 17:45:36.920]  and I was in the British
[17:45:36.920 --> 17:45:38.920]  Tercorami and my younger brother was in Royal Air Force
[17:45:38.920 --> 17:45:40.920]  for centre and a half years
[17:45:40.920 --> 17:45:42.920]  a nautical engineer so we have played the part
[17:45:42.920 --> 17:45:44.920]  with the forces
[17:45:44.920 --> 17:45:46.920]  and I was in Kenya coming back from Kenya in 1999
[17:45:46.920 --> 17:45:48.920]  and met another Asian gentleman who was flying out
[17:45:48.920 --> 17:45:50.920]  to Uzbekistan
[17:45:50.920 --> 17:45:52.920]  and we just took people sitting at the airport
[17:45:52.920 --> 17:45:54.920]  in reception having a chat
[17:45:54.920 --> 17:45:56.920]  and I asked him where he was off to
[17:45:56.920 --> 17:45:58.920]  and he said I'm going to Uzbekistan and I said why
[17:45:58.920 --> 17:46:00.920]  because they found oil and I'm an engineer I take oil
[17:46:00.920 --> 17:46:02.920]  and he told me that three countries
[17:46:02.920 --> 17:46:04.920]  have found oil and the oil pipeline
[17:46:04.920 --> 17:46:06.920]  was supposed to go from Afghanistan
[17:46:06.920 --> 17:46:08.920]  into Karachi in Pakistan
[17:46:08.920 --> 17:46:10.920]  this conspiracy in any level
[17:46:10.920 --> 17:46:12.920]  was planned to stop the pipeline
[17:46:12.920 --> 17:46:14.920]  going into those two countries
[17:46:14.920 --> 17:46:16.920]  you don't know that you're just guessing
[17:46:16.920 --> 17:46:18.920]  no no no I'm telling you the truth
[17:46:18.920 --> 17:46:20.920]  you're telling me that Rochdale are announcing
[17:46:20.920 --> 17:46:22.920]  the official version this evening
[17:46:22.920 --> 17:46:24.920]  well let me comment on this
[17:46:24.920 --> 17:46:26.920]  let me comment on this
[17:46:26.920 --> 17:46:28.920]  actually it was a
[17:46:28.920 --> 17:46:30.920]  trifecta of issues
[17:46:30.920 --> 17:46:32.920]  and we actually have the now two books
[17:46:32.920 --> 17:46:34.920]  written by Zbigniew Brzezinski
[17:46:34.920 --> 17:46:36.920]  who was the architect of the original
[17:46:36.920 --> 17:46:38.920]  Afghan war against the Soviets
[17:46:38.920 --> 17:46:40.920]  he really kicked it off with the planning in
[17:46:40.920 --> 17:46:42.920]  79-80
[17:46:42.920 --> 17:46:44.920]  he's written two books specifically on the
[17:46:44.920 --> 17:46:46.920]  subject he wrote
[17:46:46.920 --> 17:46:48.920]  one in 97 called the grand chess board
[17:46:48.920 --> 17:46:50.920]  and he basically
[17:46:50.920 --> 17:46:52.920]  said you can't allow the stands
[17:46:52.920 --> 17:46:54.920]  to bring their oil out to the sea
[17:46:54.920 --> 17:46:56.920]  and you've got to take over Pakistan
[17:46:56.920 --> 17:46:58.920]  and Afghanistan or at least he stabilized them
[17:46:58.920 --> 17:47:00.920]  and have an excuse to get US troops in there
[17:47:00.920 --> 17:47:02.920]  or the Chinese are going to dominate
[17:47:02.920 --> 17:47:04.920]  the region and get the
[17:47:04.920 --> 17:47:06.920]  fuel and energy supplies that they need
[17:47:06.920 --> 17:47:08.920]  so the trifecta is this
[17:47:08.920 --> 17:47:10.920]  in Afghanistan alone not mentioning
[17:47:10.920 --> 17:47:12.920]  the other seven stands around it
[17:47:12.920 --> 17:47:14.920]  in 2000 numbers
[17:47:14.920 --> 17:47:16.920]  this was released by the World Bank
[17:47:16.920 --> 17:47:18.920]  there's four trillion
[17:47:18.920 --> 17:47:20.920]  that number's a lot higher now because the prices
[17:47:20.920 --> 17:47:22.920]  have gone up in discovered oil fields
[17:47:22.920 --> 17:47:24.920]  oil supplies
[17:47:24.920 --> 17:47:26.920]  four trillion conservatively in US dollars
[17:47:26.920 --> 17:47:28.920]  that was back then obviously they're devalued
[17:47:28.920 --> 17:47:30.920]  now so it's more
[17:47:30.920 --> 17:47:32.920]  also there's 500 billion a year in opium
[17:47:32.920 --> 17:47:34.920]  93% of opium production for heroin
[17:47:34.920 --> 17:47:36.920]  the precursor to heroin comes out of there
[17:47:36.920 --> 17:47:38.920]  only 10% came out until the liberation
[17:47:38.920 --> 17:47:40.920]  and I have Fox News
[17:47:40.920 --> 17:47:42.920]  where they admit the US troops and British troops
[17:47:42.920 --> 17:47:44.920]  helped grow the opium and supply on the fertilizer
[17:47:44.920 --> 17:47:46.920]  that shipped into our country
[17:47:46.920 --> 17:47:48.920]  and if you're doubting me just type
[17:47:48.920 --> 17:47:50.920]  Harolda Rivera
[17:47:50.920 --> 17:47:52.920]  US Marines helping grow opium
[17:47:52.920 --> 17:47:54.920]  and they now just admit it
[17:47:54.920 --> 17:47:56.920]  the fact that here you have one of the best fighting
[17:47:56.920 --> 17:47:58.920]  forces in the world ever mounted
[17:47:58.920 --> 17:48:00.920]  and in a sense
[17:48:00.920 --> 17:48:02.920]  you're watching as this opium is being
[17:48:02.920 --> 17:48:04.920]  grown I know it grinds at your gut
[17:48:04.920 --> 17:48:06.920]  how do you deal with it
[17:48:06.920 --> 17:48:08.920]  what are you doing about it
[17:48:08.920 --> 17:48:10.920]  frankly this is part of the culture
[17:48:10.920 --> 17:48:12.920]  so while it might grind in my gut
[17:48:12.920 --> 17:48:14.920]  it's what they do
[17:48:14.920 --> 17:48:16.920]  also her BBC ones on the radio
[17:48:16.920 --> 17:48:18.920]  on my XM admit it
[17:48:18.920 --> 17:48:20.920]  they're now just throwing it in our face like we're dumb
[17:48:20.920 --> 17:48:22.920]  oh by the way we're growing it but we're fighting drugs
[17:48:22.920 --> 17:48:24.920]  so if you catch you whether you're going to prison
[17:48:24.920 --> 17:48:26.920]  but side issue they gotta keep the drugs illegal
[17:48:26.920 --> 17:48:28.920]  to keep the price up so it's about the 500
[17:48:28.920 --> 17:48:30.920]  let me just come in there
[17:48:30.920 --> 17:48:32.920]  the fact that the opium has been
[17:48:32.920 --> 17:48:34.920]  rightly or wrongly the only crop
[17:48:34.920 --> 17:48:36.920]  in that region for people to make a living
[17:48:36.920 --> 17:48:38.920]  is that why production went up
[17:48:38.920 --> 17:48:40.920]  the allies are kinda stuck what do they do here
[17:48:40.920 --> 17:48:42.920]  are they meant to be starving out the entire place
[17:48:42.920 --> 17:48:44.920]  they're not there as a prince force
[17:48:44.920 --> 17:48:46.920]  for the average law abiding afghanity
[17:48:46.920 --> 17:48:48.920]  they are there for other reasons
[17:48:48.920 --> 17:48:50.920]  the northern alliance, northern hard place
[17:48:50.920 --> 17:48:52.920]  Muhammad Karzai's brother
[17:48:52.920 --> 17:48:54.920]  is the largest narcotics trafficker
[17:48:54.920 --> 17:48:56.920]  that's the New York Times
[17:48:56.920 --> 17:48:58.920]  the northern alliance were the people
[17:48:58.920 --> 17:49:00.920]  that controlled the opium before
[17:49:00.920 --> 17:49:02.920]  the real taliban the real muslim
[17:49:02.920 --> 17:49:04.920]  people that were running it
[17:49:04.920 --> 17:49:06.920]  shut down almost all opium production
[17:49:06.920 --> 17:49:08.920]  the west went in took it over
[17:49:08.920 --> 17:49:10.920]  to shut down the pipeline of unical
[17:49:10.920 --> 17:49:12.920]  being built and they went in
[17:49:12.920 --> 17:49:14.920]  to get control of the 500 billion a year
[17:49:14.920 --> 17:49:16.920]  and production went up 13 fold
[17:49:16.920 --> 17:49:18.920]  it's now 93%
[17:49:18.920 --> 17:49:20.920]  of world production
[17:49:20.920 --> 17:49:22.920]  and they give them the fertilizer
[17:49:22.920 --> 17:49:24.920]  and guard it and then it's loaded
[17:49:24.920 --> 17:49:26.920]  on aircraft and flown
[17:49:26.920 --> 17:49:28.920]  in to europe
[17:49:28.920 --> 17:49:30.920]  russia and the united states
[17:49:30.920 --> 17:49:32.920]  and the rest of the world
[17:49:32.920 --> 17:49:34.920]  the only opium dealers and heroin dealers
[17:49:34.920 --> 17:49:36.920]  that are busted are people buying it
[17:49:36.920 --> 17:49:38.920]  from southeast asian golden triangle
[17:49:38.920 --> 17:49:40.920]  suppliers now not
[17:49:40.920 --> 17:49:42.920]  controlled by the anglo-american
[17:49:42.920 --> 17:49:44.920]  power axis the british empire
[17:49:44.920 --> 17:49:46.920]  financed itself
[17:49:46.920 --> 17:49:48.920]  in 16 and 1700
[17:49:48.920 --> 17:49:50.920]  with the opium

[17:54:18.760 --> 17:54:22.920]  just have a label so you can your mind can decide

[17:54:39.240 --> 17:54:44.640]  created fake bin Laden videos so a group that has created fake videos before you
[17:54:44.640 --> 17:54:48.600]  said yes so so the fact that you and your your friends have made a video and put on
[17:54:48.600 --> 17:54:51.640]  YouTube that makes it that makes it you're showing you're showing you the
[17:54:51.640 --> 17:54:58.120]  conspiracy theories I just gave you the date and what to search Washington Post
[17:54:58.120 --> 17:55:03.080]  and you just and you just said it's going to be on YouTube I just told you
[17:55:03.080 --> 17:55:08.880]  buddy boy my source is not YouTube my source is what I just told you and when
[17:55:08.880 --> 17:55:14.880]  I say Steve Pachennik was on or Hamid Ghoul was on these are serious well-known

[17:55:21.200 --> 17:55:26.760]  can't handle the truth you can't handle real intellect and red blood all you've
[17:55:26.760 --> 17:55:31.160]  got is shooting your mouth off with that cliched term I'm not the king of
[17:55:31.160 --> 17:55:36.840]  conspiracy I'm the king of reality Daniel come back on that in 30 seconds I
[17:55:36.840 --> 17:55:41.280]  told you Washington Post listen to me I bet you don't believe I bet you don't
[17:55:41.280 --> 17:55:45.480]  believe that Araldo Rivera with the Marines admit they grow the opiates Alex
[17:55:45.480 --> 17:55:50.600]  let down response to that in general society there is a very small set of
[17:55:50.600 --> 17:55:55.040]  people that would be class you're a minority with a majority listen to your
[17:55:55.040 --> 17:55:59.720]  mind control garbage I would class you and I would class you in an extremist
[17:55:59.720 --> 17:56:04.280]  group that would account for not I need to be dealt with and listen to him he

[17:56:18.040 --> 17:56:24.080]  many facts it's scary he's an extremist he's a minority oh I'm a minority that's
[17:56:24.080 --> 17:56:29.320]  why my YouTube videos have millions of views of peace and 98% of people are
[17:56:29.320 --> 17:56:33.800]  voting that they like it that's why I have millions of listeners that's why
[17:56:33.800 --> 17:56:38.920]  I'm loved all over the world because I'm a dangerous minority you listen to me
[17:56:38.920 --> 17:56:44.120]  ideas are bulletproof and you cannot stop us liberty is rising the spirit of
[17:56:44.120 --> 17:56:50.040]  1776 is indomitable and you are a mind-controlled weasel who feels solace
[17:56:50.040 --> 17:56:55.320]  in joining the hive board of weakness information you are not the intellectual
[17:56:55.320 --> 17:57:01.160]  you are not the person to dictate to me what reality is do you understand me

[17:57:07.880 --> 17:57:13.760]  Alex you are part of a minority the board will absorb you no one agrees with
[17:57:13.760 --> 17:57:19.240]  you Alex it's over a racist government MPs and everyone there are small sector
[17:57:19.240 --> 17:57:25.240]  people they're all dangerous and we need to deal with him
[17:57:25.240 --> 17:57:32.920]  which do exist as much as you make a conspiracy theory out there and they
[17:57:32.920 --> 17:57:37.920]  preach hate the certain community and you unsuccessfully are attending you are
[17:57:37.920 --> 17:57:44.240]  part of a minority you're a conspiracy theorist you're unsuccessful you just
[17:57:44.240 --> 17:57:50.560]  have forces on YouTube point Alex he made no point he said I'm defeated he said
[17:57:50.560 --> 17:57:55.440]  I'm losing I'm waiting and you know it coward you know it just because you say
[17:57:55.440 --> 17:57:59.720]  we're losing you can feel for your lies pouring out you're losing we will find
[17:57:59.720 --> 17:58:04.400]  out about the Obama birth certificate you're losing liberties rising away
[17:58:04.400 --> 17:58:17.240]  I'll guess is Alex Jones he's at info wars dot com you can follow Alex on
[17:58:17.240 --> 17:58:22.680]  Twitter via that site you can have a look at a whole ray of stories and you
[17:58:22.680 --> 17:58:27.400]  will know if you didn't already you do now that Alex has I think we can say
[17:58:27.400 --> 17:58:33.640]  passionate opinions on things hey like for example the official version versus
[17:58:33.640 --> 17:58:38.480]  what maybe he sees as the real version his White House press secretary Jay
[17:58:38.480 --> 17:58:44.000]  Carney there are sensitivities here in terms of the appropriateness of
[17:58:44.000 --> 17:58:49.400]  releasing photographs of Osama bin Laden and in the aftermath of this
[17:58:49.400 --> 17:58:53.000]  firefight and we're making an evaluation about the need to do that they
[17:58:53.000 --> 17:58:56.800]  could be inflammatory they're making it could be inflammatory Alex Jones they
[17:58:56.800 --> 17:59:00.760]  don't want to scare folk with a dead corpse with its head shot out yeah
[17:59:00.760 --> 17:59:05.000]  that's totally ridiculous they're just busy getting everybody's appetite wet
[17:59:05.000 --> 17:59:09.320]  and fawning after they've already you destroyed the body for all of their new
[17:59:09.320 --> 17:59:12.240]  fake video to be rolled up and I want to respond to some because my guys were
[17:59:12.240 --> 17:59:15.720]  listening in the other room and you had me faded down for the local Psyop guy to
[17:59:15.720 --> 17:59:19.720]  call in well I didn't fairness Alex he did need to just come I want to say
[17:59:19.720 --> 17:59:24.480]  something to what he said okay number one I'm letting it all hang out because
[17:59:24.480 --> 17:59:28.760]  people need to stop being put in little comfort boxes and not be the true
[17:59:28.760 --> 17:59:32.880]  passionate creatures we are for liberty you yell and scream for a football game
[17:59:32.880 --> 17:59:36.320]  people say oh that's normal that's nice you yell and scream about losing your
[17:59:36.320 --> 17:59:40.000]  freedom and and and about lies being crammed on your throat and people say
[17:59:40.000 --> 17:59:43.800]  it's weird so I'm here about being proud to be wild and to be informed now
[17:59:43.800 --> 17:59:49.200]  listen the reason I got unhinged with him is because he's he said what's your
[17:59:49.200 --> 17:59:54.160]  proof and I said I gave him the date of where the CIA admits they've put out
[17:59:54.160 --> 17:59:59.440]  fake bin Laden videos before and it's them's telling the big CIA mouthpiece
[17:59:59.440 --> 18:00:03.400]  Washington Post that's their favorite paper that information he just laughed
[18:00:03.400 --> 18:00:07.600]  at it and said you've got a YouTube video and I said no you just heard me I
[18:00:07.600 --> 18:00:11.880]  gave you a source then he said you're little you're nobody nobody listens you're

[18:01:57.760 --> 18:02:01.720]  about against Vince McMahon and others and they check with constitutional
[18:02:01.720 --> 18:02:05.880]  experts they filed it clearly violated his fourth amendment other issues I would
[18:02:05.880 --> 18:02:09.200]  go after a tent amendment to his federal power grab and then the court just

[18:03:51.880 --> 18:03:56.440]  bottom and we'll look at this together and I'll go to your calls because I find
[18:03:56.440 --> 18:04:01.160]  that to be interesting we've got signed fall the republic posters which are
[18:04:01.160 --> 18:04:04.080]  only a limited run because we just printed them up to be on the walls here
[18:04:04.080 --> 18:04:09.880]  in the office and wow the bids are pouring in on those so that'll go to the
[18:04:09.880 --> 18:04:17.120]  money bomb we've also got two original with the tinfoil wrap in game and we
[18:04:17.120 --> 18:04:20.640]  found a couple of those in a box when they came out three and a half four
[18:04:20.640 --> 18:04:23.800]  years ago there was a one-time run because it costs more to have it done
[18:04:23.800 --> 18:04:28.120]  with this green tinfoil cover and we found two of those those are signed number
[18:04:28.120 --> 18:04:31.400]  one and number two I'm gonna sign this I haven't signed it yet it's the George
[18:04:31.400 --> 18:04:38.120]  Bush mask that I've worn on TV and used off and on for about six seven years and
[18:04:38.120 --> 18:04:42.480]  then there's tourney crusher to we got this in four or five years ago even
[18:04:42.480 --> 18:04:46.080]  before the other one got broken during crusher once it's been it's been at
[18:04:46.080 --> 18:04:50.320]  many events we got the sledgehammer we used to break up in the wall the other
[18:04:50.320 --> 18:04:54.320]  side when we leased that and that's at four thousand nine hundred dollars I
[18:04:54.320 --> 18:04:57.240]  think we started the bid like a hundred bucks or something so really want to
[18:04:57.240 --> 18:05:01.360]  thank folks out there that are doing that and if you click on the sledgehammer
[18:05:01.360 --> 18:05:05.880]  you can see it so the sledgehammer right now is going for more than the bullhorn
[18:05:05.880 --> 18:05:11.800]  but it's been up longer and that bid actually ends in a couple days so
[18:05:11.800 --> 18:05:16.920]  that's all up there but you can see it signed right there and stated and it's
[18:05:16.920 --> 18:05:23.040]  got the info wars.com on it so there you have it we've actually used that quite a
[18:05:23.040 --> 18:05:29.840]  bit some of the work we've done around here but it's got a don't tread on me
[18:05:29.840 --> 18:05:35.040]  snake I guess that's what's really stuck is a sticker on there but knocking down
[18:05:35.040 --> 18:05:40.160]  the walls of the New World Order a hundred and seventy two dollar bid for
[18:05:40.160 --> 18:05:49.480]  the George Bush mask used on air yeah you can see the video like at the end of
[18:05:49.480 --> 18:05:55.200]  the crazy like Alex Jones video you can see me wearing that an access TV like
[18:05:55.200 --> 18:05:58.840]  five years ago and I predict Obama would come up you know predicted they'd have
[18:05:58.840 --> 18:06:04.000]  the new left-wing but it wasn't hard to predict that I'm gonna sign it to in

[18:06:27.200 --> 18:06:31.320]  to your phone calls William in New York thanks for holding the CT Sean Eric
[18:06:31.320 --> 18:06:38.600]  Jason others coming with it hi thanks thank you sir I just wanted to comment
[18:06:38.600 --> 18:06:43.560]  on one thing about the Occupy Oakland I saw you know the fire went up and
[18:06:43.560 --> 18:06:47.600]  everything on TV and then out of nowhere you see this guy in full black
[18:06:47.600 --> 18:06:51.120]  black thing leaving the don't tread on me flag right in front of the fire in the
[18:06:51.120 --> 18:06:57.800]  camera yeah tell folks what happened in in Oakland for those that don't know they
[18:06:57.800 --> 18:07:01.840]  started the I mean I mean I don't know a lot about it I can only start like
[18:07:01.840 --> 18:07:07.520]  riding and there was I just saw on TV a big fire and then a guy in complete black
[18:07:07.520 --> 18:07:12.080]  you know black stand down on starts waving the don't tread on me flag right
[18:07:12.080 --> 18:07:15.120]  in front of fire in the camera and I would have loved to follow that guy
[18:07:15.120 --> 18:07:19.680]  right back to the police station because like it just I feel like it's kind of
[18:07:19.680 --> 18:07:23.520]  like the bullshit thing like if he came out of nowhere with the don't tread on
[18:07:23.520 --> 18:07:27.920]  me flag after the fire was up right in front of the camera well yeah I've
[18:07:27.920 --> 18:07:32.200]  actually seen that we should pull up the Oakland riot fire footage and show
[18:07:32.200 --> 18:07:37.040]  people that the reason notice Oakland's in trouble for shooting the veteran in
[18:07:37.040 --> 18:07:41.680]  the face and whether rubber bullets or with the tear gas canister point like
[18:07:41.680 --> 18:07:46.160]  range that's the kind of time that they then stage things to legitimize what
[18:07:46.160 --> 18:07:49.720]  they've done previously and the police have been calling over the world
[18:07:49.720 --> 18:07:54.080]  revocaturing staging things doing horrible stuff and so that's that's part
[18:07:54.080 --> 18:07:57.960]  of the course but we'll look into that more good point I just I just noticed
[18:07:57.960 --> 18:08:01.320]  that like that's the main thing on TV the guys waving the don't tread on me
[18:08:01.320 --> 18:08:06.000]  flagging for the fire so I figured it might be like a like oh these guys are
[18:08:06.000 --> 18:08:09.400]  bad like the tea party's horrible and you know they're gonna you know blow
[18:08:09.400 --> 18:08:16.080]  things up and kill everybody what do you think of the 24 hour 27 hour

[18:08:37.760 --> 18:08:41.160]  wouldn't be one of our biggest money bombs because I can see the entire
[18:08:41.160 --> 18:08:44.320]  economy believe me I experienced that that's why we're trying to get even
[18:08:44.320 --> 18:08:47.920]  more capital in here so we can be you know sustain ourselves and be strong we

[18:09:41.880 --> 18:09:46.400]  long-term smoker myself trying to break that hey you know what I got to thank
[18:09:46.400 --> 18:09:51.800]  Richard Link leader for for waking me up because he put this guy in a movie called
[18:09:51.800 --> 18:09:57.840]  Skinner Darkly with a megaphone yeah tyranny crusher one was actually the
[18:09:57.840 --> 18:10:04.760]  the the bullhorn used in that film yeah that's that's how that's how it happened I
[18:10:04.760 --> 18:10:08.680]  saw you in that movie and I was like who's that guy go to the internet next
[18:10:08.680 --> 18:10:12.080]  thing you know down the rabbit hole so that's that's not happened for me man
[18:10:12.080 --> 18:10:15.520]  that's how I woke up I just wanted to you know let you know that I appreciate
[18:10:15.520 --> 18:10:19.800]  everything that you did you know thank you my friend through years here's a
[18:10:19.800 --> 18:10:23.720]  question for you I'm a networking guy you know I've been doing a podcast for
[18:10:23.720 --> 18:10:27.680]  the last three years you know just you know using your inspiration to try and
[18:10:27.680 --> 18:10:31.320]  wake more people up and for me what I you know what I'm trying to do is put
[18:10:31.320 --> 18:10:36.480]  people together what do you think it would take to put these occupy Wall
[18:10:36.480 --> 18:10:40.880]  Street people and the Tea Party people the real ones not the money people on
[18:10:40.880 --> 18:10:52.240]  the same page well look this is a process of awakening that is happening
[18:10:52.240 --> 18:10:57.440]  that's what's going on is is that people are figuring out Wall Street's
[18:10:57.440 --> 18:11:02.880]  taking over DC and so the establishment Obama and others endorsing the part of
[18:11:02.880 --> 18:11:06.880]  the movement they control is about making it about class warfare division
[18:11:06.880 --> 18:11:11.660]  attacking capitalism free market that hasn't done this the opposite the
[18:11:11.660 --> 18:11:15.640]  partnership of the mega banks of government this crony insider fascism
[18:11:15.640 --> 18:11:20.080]  as Gerald called it has allowed that and so I think you educate you know the
[18:11:20.080 --> 18:11:23.960]  people down there who are already in enough awake to be down there and you
[18:11:23.960 --> 18:11:27.960]  continue to educate the Tea Party started by the Ron Paul movement and people
[18:11:27.960 --> 18:11:31.760]  like myself you know I think Time Magazine called me the the prophet of
[18:11:31.760 --> 18:11:37.920]  the Tea Party and in a way that's true I mean all of us are though and it's a
[18:11:37.920 --> 18:11:40.560]  fight for the heart and soul of any movement they're gonna try to cut off
[18:11:40.560 --> 18:11:45.280]  any movement and they're gonna try to provocateur any movement and it's gonna
[18:11:45.280 --> 18:11:49.280]  be a crazy time there's gonna be a lot of a lot of games a lot of deception but
[18:11:49.280 --> 18:11:55.080]  deception propaganda stops working when people have empty bellies right right
[18:11:55.080 --> 18:11:59.080]  well you know I know you got a bunch of the people on the line I'll get out of
[18:11:59.080 --> 18:12:02.360]  your hair there's ever anything I can do for you guys you just track me down at
[18:12:02.360 --> 18:12:06.640]  truth radio dot com truth radio net dot com that's where I've been doing my
[18:12:06.640 --> 18:12:11.560]  work educate people I ask for game well you know just you know trying to give
[18:12:11.560 --> 18:12:14.440]  them the reality of what's going on in the world and you're the inspiration man
[18:12:14.440 --> 18:12:18.280]  thank you well thank you my friend and I appreciate your call you know I would
[18:12:18.280 --> 18:12:24.240]  just say this that the system always tries to get anybody who starts doing a
[18:12:24.240 --> 18:12:31.120]  show to in fight and and and to make it about who's good who's bad and and you
[18:12:31.120 --> 18:12:35.440]  know you know endless little internal conspiracy theories Cass Sunstein
[18:12:35.440 --> 18:12:41.520]  actually actually talks about that you know how to get people that aren't
[18:12:41.520 --> 18:12:45.320]  buying into the false reality of the New World Order fighting with each other
[18:12:45.320 --> 18:12:53.480]  kind of chasing our tails but that that you'll never see an operative talking
[18:12:53.480 --> 18:12:57.320]  about aspartame we're talking about sodium fluoride or talking about GMO or
[18:12:57.320 --> 18:13:02.040]  talking about Fukushima and warning people are talking about all the stuff
[18:13:02.040 --> 18:13:06.360]  the operatives just endlessly will get everybody to fight with each other and
[18:13:06.360 --> 18:13:09.960]  criticize other groups and I'm the only one that has the answers and this
[18:13:09.960 --> 18:13:13.820]  person's of this or this person's of that or they're a Vatican assassin or they
[18:13:13.820 --> 18:13:18.320]  work for Israel or they're a reptoid or they're a pop tartar whatever you can
[18:13:18.320 --> 18:13:22.760]  tell a tree by its fruits and that's the type of radio shows the type of issues
[18:13:22.760 --> 18:13:26.600]  that's where you can really help people I mean aspartame big people go blind it's
[18:13:26.600 --> 18:13:31.320]  causing diabetes to go off the chart all these new cancers and things from the
[18:13:31.320 --> 18:13:35.600]  fluoride I mean these are things we can prove the mercury in the shots all of
[18:13:35.600 --> 18:13:40.200]  that these are things where we can help people and that's why when people join in
[18:13:40.200 --> 18:13:44.160]  on the in-fighting and the you know kind of like it's different football teams in
[18:13:44.160 --> 18:13:48.420]  the conspiracy world or whatever which is just a look into reality you're
[18:13:48.420 --> 18:13:51.680]  distracting if you're not an operative you're just weak-minded some of you out
[18:13:51.680 --> 18:13:55.800]  there you're distracting from time and issues and real stuff that can really
[18:13:55.800 --> 18:14:01.080]  help people like trying to stop new wars trying to stop new banker bailouts
[18:14:01.080 --> 18:14:06.520]  trying to stop children being drugged I mean you know CPS taking kids doing
[18:14:06.520 --> 18:14:10.320]  medical experiments on them I mean there's some hardcore evil going on and I
[18:14:10.320 --> 18:14:14.960]  want to warn people for their souls if you don't believe in the soul just just
[18:14:14.960 --> 18:14:20.000]  for humanity when when you fight against truth-tellers you are really
[18:14:20.000 --> 18:14:27.600]  throwing your lot in with some very very wicked systems and people and it's just
[18:14:27.600 --> 18:14:36.720]  that sample who's up next here Sean in Arizona you're on the air go ahead yes
[18:14:36.720 --> 18:14:40.640]  my Texas friend I'm a little bit nervous I've been trying to prepare my notes
[18:14:40.640 --> 18:14:46.000]  with you I've been wanting to say some critical things here would you allow me
[18:14:46.000 --> 18:14:50.320]  the floor for five minutes and rest your voice and and may I may I ask you

[18:14:54.080 --> 18:14:59.040]  years will you allow me today to say my last name because if you can go on the
[18:14:59.040 --> 18:15:05.040]  firing lines and risk your life and your family your fame that I think I can
[18:15:05.040 --> 18:15:09.120]  say my last name yeah Sean you know why talk radio doesn't want people to say
[18:15:09.120 --> 18:15:14.240]  their last name right no you tell me because people call in and say they're
[18:15:14.240 --> 18:15:20.200]  somebody who they aren't and then basically libel or slander that person
[18:15:20.200 --> 18:15:24.160]  and I got I got it let me be time is short I got I'm gonna say my name I'm
[18:15:24.160 --> 18:15:31.520]  Sean Sean O'Reilly I've been living as a sovereign like Mr. Dask for 26 years I
[18:15:31.520 --> 18:15:38.160]  worked for Reagan before I was as formed as I am now and I want to point out a
[18:15:38.160 --> 18:15:43.480]  couple quick things to your folks first of all I wanted I've lived a Louis
[18:15:43.480 --> 18:15:51.640]  Lamour life and I call from Arizona but I'm a Wyoming I I've spent my most of
[18:15:51.640 --> 18:15:56.080]  my life in Montana Wyoming I learned about the Constitution and the common
[18:15:56.080 --> 18:16:03.840]  law from my friend Rick but red Beckman and your friend as well I've got Lyme
[18:16:03.840 --> 18:16:09.040]  disease and I came down to Arizona for six weeks of our an hour five years ago
[18:16:09.040 --> 18:16:13.960]  and the Lyme disease hit me in the but so to speak and I've been living off my
[18:16:13.960 --> 18:16:18.360]  savings for five years if my savings hadn't been a hundred percent and gold
[18:16:18.360 --> 18:16:25.360]  and silver I'd be on the streets now I live in my friends RV on the ranch and
[18:16:25.360 --> 18:16:29.480]  in the summer it gets pretty hot down here I have no air conditioning but
[18:16:29.480 --> 18:16:38.120]  we're tough in Montana and Wyoming and I can't sleep in that the RV till
[18:16:38.120 --> 18:16:43.800]  midnight sometimes because it's so hot in the summer so I went down a sheet like
[18:16:43.800 --> 18:16:51.440]  the pioneers did and I lay out on a picnic cable a bench and when it gets
[18:16:51.440 --> 18:16:55.880]  about midnight I crawl back into the RV now I don't know what's the matter with
[18:16:55.880 --> 18:17:02.880]  our countrymen you're a Texan and I have lived a Louis Lamour life and sometime
[18:17:02.880 --> 18:17:06.680]  I'd like to come I'd like to talk to you if you'd give a common person an hour
[18:17:06.680 --> 18:17:11.680]  because everything that I've done I've run into the Rockefellers and Lawrence
[18:17:11.680 --> 18:17:16.280]  Rockefeller Lawrence's Rockefeller daughter 20 years ago I had a fight
[18:17:16.280 --> 18:17:21.880]  about Cuban Castro about Fidel Castro because she told me that she used to go
[18:17:21.880 --> 18:17:26.360]  down and visit him well she must have went down and visit him with David
[18:17:26.360 --> 18:17:33.200]  Rockefeller's grandchild you had a desk on here earlier he's just stellar he
[18:17:33.200 --> 18:17:40.040]  gets it you get it I a couple things either be I'm the guy that they gave
[18:17:40.040 --> 18:17:46.680]  this document that I took over to the Bush boys which were the four of them I
[18:17:46.680 --> 18:17:53.600]  believe at the Ponce a train hotel on the morning of the of the of the Thursday
[18:17:53.600 --> 18:17:57.920]  morning of the last week of the convention and it was the history on
[18:17:57.920 --> 18:18:04.240]  George Herbert Walker Bush and they told me not to look at it and I took it
[18:18:04.240 --> 18:18:10.200]  across Jefferson Avenue from the 67th floor of the Detroit the Troy Plaza
[18:18:10.200 --> 18:18:15.040]  Hotel in the Rensen over to the Ponce and every Detroiters that's listening knows
[18:18:15.040 --> 18:18:21.920]  about that and I looked at it and I looked at the history of George Walker's
[18:18:21.920 --> 18:18:28.640]  history in his life and eight years later in Cody Wyoming when I was reading
[18:18:28.640 --> 18:18:34.520]  Sutton's book I turned the page and Sutton had had a list of what Walker
[18:18:34.520 --> 18:18:38.080]  Herbert Walker had done his life including those that time with his apple
[18:18:38.080 --> 18:18:43.120]  oil and it was the exact same stuff I had read from this document I have I've
[18:18:43.120 --> 18:18:50.120]  been I've been very fortunate and your your your viewers don't understand and
[18:18:50.120 --> 18:18:56.480]  I've called in several times and say my friend you are just dead spot-armed we
[18:18:56.480 --> 18:19:02.680]  had a my French grandmother came to this country with nothing at Ellis Island
[18:19:02.680 --> 18:19:09.360]  my grandmother Mahoney was born in Corktown to Detroit where the Irish
[18:19:09.360 --> 18:19:16.400]  poor were not too far from Tiger Stadium and I could almost cry with this
[18:19:16.400 --> 18:19:21.960]  information people don't realize your information the 1908 deal about custody
[18:19:21.960 --> 18:19:27.400]  with the state against families that happened to our family and I never could
[18:19:27.400 --> 18:19:31.680]  I could never figure it out until your broadcast in the last two years and
[18:19:31.680 --> 18:19:37.960]  you've mentioned it up several times the Catholic Church my great
[18:19:37.960 --> 18:19:44.600]  grandmother's husband died so they were very poor in Detroit and and the
[18:19:44.600 --> 18:19:50.400]  Catholic Church got involved I believe with the state and they were going to
[18:19:50.400 --> 18:19:54.960]  take the three kids away from my great grandmother and those were the days a
[18:19:54.960 --> 18:19:59.080]  hundred years ago where you didn't have information running to and flow and she
[18:19:59.080 --> 18:20:05.360]  relocated herself all the time every six months to keep those kids and that was
[18:20:05.360 --> 18:20:11.440]  a result I'm positive of this of this of this legislation that you said were
[18:20:11.440 --> 18:20:16.840]  passed in 1988 because that's what it happened to my family 1900 and 1910
[18:20:16.840 --> 18:20:22.000]  you're just a God send my friend I could go on and on with let me tell you one
[18:20:22.000 --> 18:20:26.360]  other thing here and then I'll be quiet I was sitting I was working on a
[18:20:26.360 --> 18:20:32.160]  motion picture in Aspen in 2001 I was sitting in a hot tub four weeks after
[18:20:32.160 --> 18:20:38.400]  we had taken Kabul and I was sitting in a hot tub of a resort because I'd work
[18:20:38.400 --> 18:20:44.120]  my butt off and you know what production hours are 16 hours 18 hours a day and
[18:20:44.120 --> 18:20:49.040]  there was a stewardess and a pilot there who had flown in on a shuttle flight
[18:20:49.040 --> 18:20:53.680]  from Denver and they take the people back in the morning this is just
[18:20:53.680 --> 18:20:58.320]  unbelievable and my whole life in the West has been a testament to these
[18:20:58.320 --> 18:21:04.200]  things and he said I got a call from my old friend I went to college with he's
[18:21:04.200 --> 18:21:09.440]  in Kabul this was four weeks after the fall of Kabul in 01 and he said who do
[18:21:09.440 --> 18:21:13.800]  you think is that he named the famous hotel in Kabul where he was at who do
[18:21:13.800 --> 18:21:19.720]  you think son the third fourth fifth and sixth floor and this this pilot was
[18:21:19.720 --> 18:21:24.240]  telling us he said I said Ashley Bancroft who was that hot little number at
[18:21:24.240 --> 18:21:31.600]  MSNBC at the time he said oh yeah yeah she's here too but Halliburton Halliburton
[18:21:31.600 --> 18:21:38.400]  Dick Janie that phony that we've known in Wyoming all these years about he his
[18:21:38.400 --> 18:21:46.120]  people were there it was all about the pipeline wake up give to this program
[18:21:46.120 --> 18:21:52.800]  give to Alex Jones for go your whiskey and your cigarettes if I can forgo a
[18:21:52.800 --> 18:21:58.680]  little bit of money hold on hold on and listen you're very nice sir but but if
[18:21:58.680 --> 18:22:01.800]  you're living in RV with no air conditioning and sleeping outside I
[18:22:01.800 --> 18:22:04.880]  probably actually healthier most people live in air conditioning the point is
[18:22:04.880 --> 18:22:09.280]  you're great and God bless you and it's great to hear from you Sean but but
[18:22:09.280 --> 18:22:15.640]  listen I do not want people to donate who are not in great means and and of
[18:22:15.640 --> 18:22:21.120]  course it's always folks who don't have much you want to give the globalist
[18:22:21.120 --> 18:22:24.880]  pull their money or more often not take our money and then get it through
[18:22:24.880 --> 18:22:29.000]  corporate welfare and then use it against us this is just about you've
[18:22:29.000 --> 18:22:33.080]  seen the growth of our operation you've seen the changes we've made and these
[18:22:33.080 --> 18:22:37.200]  money bombs just create pure capital with these worthless fellow reserve notes
[18:22:37.200 --> 18:22:40.880]  they're becoming more worthless every day to put it into more crew and then I
[18:22:40.880 --> 18:22:44.040]  can really because I say I don't want to hire people and then have things go
[18:22:44.040 --> 18:22:47.920]  even more south that lay them off in six months you know this allows us for
[18:22:47.920 --> 18:22:52.680]  like a year to be able to hire four or five more people get some equipment we
[18:22:52.680 --> 18:22:56.880]  need a way it's going to be able to hire like three they get some of the
[18:22:56.880 --> 18:23:05.920]  equipment some other stuff but m4's money bomb com or 888-253-3139 888-253-3139
[18:23:05.920 --> 18:23:12.320]  let's go ahead and go to Eric in Oregon but listen here Sean I want you given to
[18:23:12.320 --> 18:23:18.680]  the money bomb okay all right because when people of no means or little means
[18:23:18.680 --> 18:23:22.160]  start giving you have means to call in you have means to speak out that's the
[18:23:22.160 --> 18:23:26.560]  most powerful thing in the world but I mean financially then I don't want to
[18:23:26.560 --> 18:23:32.600]  have to when I buy the crew lunch or when I you know do something with my wife
[18:23:32.600 --> 18:23:37.560]  whatever that start you know I I'm not going preachers saying you know widows
[18:23:37.560 --> 18:23:41.600]  might give me all your money and God's gonna bless you this okay you know this
[18:23:41.600 --> 18:23:46.360]  is a temporal thing we know just on the surface we're fighting tyranny and if
[18:23:46.360 --> 18:23:50.320]  people believe in it they can donate to it and and the idea of voting with your
[18:23:50.320 --> 18:23:57.280]  dollars the idea of supporting alternative media period that is
[18:23:57.280 --> 18:24:01.760]  beautiful that strong and the howls I wouldn't even do money bomb this year I
[18:24:01.760 --> 18:24:06.400]  just wasn't going to expand but things are shutting down so fast we ended up
[18:24:06.400 --> 18:24:15.040]  we kind of need it if we want to continue at the level and perhaps grow but
[18:24:15.040 --> 18:24:18.920]  then I see the howls of people you better not have a money bomb and that's
[18:24:18.920 --> 18:24:23.880]  because they've put this meme in this psychological trigger that little people
[18:24:23.880 --> 18:24:27.920]  aren't supposed to get together and build things and do things that it's
[18:24:27.920 --> 18:24:32.040]  somehow bad to even sell a book or a DVD but the government it's moral to take
[18:24:32.040 --> 18:24:38.040]  your money at gunpoint and use it against you this is the type of bizarreness
[18:24:38.040 --> 18:24:45.200]  that we've got going on not just this article but but but guys will will
[18:24:45.200 --> 18:24:49.280]  Jones was showing me where he was confirming that they're making people
[18:24:49.280 --> 18:24:55.200]  thumb-scan to rent video games or buy video games in Miami and I want to give
[18:24:55.200 --> 18:24:59.360]  this to Watson this is interesting news but I hope I guess will say I'll talk to
[18:24:59.360 --> 18:25:02.720]  him during a break something about these marathon broadcast only breaks or when I
[18:25:02.720 --> 18:25:07.120]  play a clip or something I won't take a few more calls but then out of all these
[18:25:07.120 --> 18:25:24.320]  reports we've got we just played the mega-ramp but I think I think I want to
[18:25:26.080 --> 18:25:30.800]  I think I want to play brain-eating vaccines because that's important people
[18:25:30.800 --> 18:25:34.240]  understand how they can chemically biologically put the stuff in us and
[18:25:34.240 --> 18:25:42.160]  control us I don't know we have the Libya genocide but that's just a short clip
[18:25:42.160 --> 18:25:51.040]  of little kid oh there's so many of these TSA invades Tennessee kind of good
[18:25:51.040 --> 18:25:54.160]  function idea what we've been doing here let's get ready with the brain-eating
[18:25:54.160 --> 18:25:58.680]  vaccines in a minute okay let's go ahead and go to Eric in Oregon Eric here on
[18:25:58.680 --> 18:26:04.120]  the air yeah thanks for all you're doing I called a couple times before but
[18:26:04.120 --> 18:26:08.080]  I'd like to donate some ammo for the info war and I don't have a lot of money to
[18:26:08.080 --> 18:26:12.600]  donate but my ideas could help the info war and get information out to wake
[18:26:12.600 --> 18:26:15.640]  people up so I thought if I can send in some of this memorabilia I've been
[18:26:15.640 --> 18:26:18.960]  collecting over the years my whole movement I started with the hemp
[18:26:18.960 --> 18:26:22.200]  everything movement getting people that care about hemp to come together and say
[18:26:22.200 --> 18:26:26.440]  hey you know we're not going to buy the hypocrisy and these people that are
[18:26:26.440 --> 18:26:29.720]  transnational corporations want to take our industry over to China all these
[18:26:29.720 --> 18:26:33.640]  places and build our economy back Thomas Jefferson said that hemp is the number
[18:26:33.640 --> 18:26:36.800]  one necessity to the wealth and protection of our country George Washington
[18:26:36.800 --> 18:26:40.680]  said make most of the Indian hemp sheep road everywhere our founding fathers
[18:26:40.680 --> 18:26:46.360]  have the deck that's Al Qaeda Washington I have FEMA on tape saying he was evil
[18:26:46.360 --> 18:26:49.640]  and they're obviously the good guys I mean that's not creepy to have the
[18:26:49.640 --> 18:26:52.760]  government saying George Washington's bad and putting microphones and street
[18:26:52.760 --> 18:26:56.760]  lamps so these are the good people sir well I'm gonna send you guys a hemp
[18:26:56.760 --> 18:27:00.880]  flag and I have one from Ron Paul to put up the flag like you said you know
[18:27:00.880 --> 18:27:04.040]  that we're not we're gonna be victorious and that we're gonna show people what we
[18:27:04.040 --> 18:27:06.800]  know and I have all these press photos from back when I don't know if you've
[18:27:06.800 --> 18:27:09.920]  seen this video that the government put out called hemp for victory back in
[18:27:09.920 --> 18:27:13.720]  1944 where they were actually promoting hemp and we need to grow up for the war
[18:27:13.720 --> 18:27:17.800]  effort blah blah but the whole point is I have these press photos that show us
[18:27:17.800 --> 18:27:21.320]  promoting us that we should be growing it and if people in all companies care
[18:27:21.320 --> 18:27:23.680]  about hemp if we had it we come together because of something we have in
[18:27:23.680 --> 18:27:28.480]  common and we all have hemp the fact that hemp could clothe us shelter us give
[18:27:28.480 --> 18:27:32.240]  us a food the love from the hemp community and everyone like Jesse
[18:27:32.240 --> 18:27:36.320]  Ventura Ron Paul is yours promoting hemp even if you already talked about I was
[18:27:36.320 --> 18:27:39.760]  telling you if we get wood here it's always people promoting it more and
[18:27:39.760 --> 18:27:42.640]  talking about it as an issue to get people to wake up that's how I got
[18:27:42.640 --> 18:27:46.600]  looking up to why why can't we have hemp and if you look into it Al Gorel is
[18:27:46.600 --> 18:27:50.520]  people that promote carbon tax their dad would be standard oil these oil
[18:27:50.520 --> 18:27:54.480]  companies it trying to outlaw hemp back in the day if you ever did a mini
[18:27:54.480 --> 18:27:58.320]  documentary and showing how hemp was outlawed because of the world order I
[18:27:58.320 --> 18:28:01.280]  think you'd wake up a whole new crowd of people so I'm just trying to help people
[18:28:01.280 --> 18:28:04.640]  and the freedom movement get more into hemp and people in the hand movement get
[18:28:04.640 --> 18:28:07.600]  more into freedom and get anybody that cares to come together because that's
[18:28:07.600 --> 18:28:11.080]  all I think I think we can do boycotting companies that don't care and if you
[18:28:11.080 --> 18:28:14.240]  don't endorse hemp we don't want to support you because that's something
[18:28:14.240 --> 18:28:17.760]  that's in no brainer obviously that can help the world so that's my take and I
[18:28:17.760 --> 18:28:22.720]  thank you thank you Eric thank you Eric people are really passionate about
[18:28:22.720 --> 18:28:26.680]  hemp and things for me it's a 10th Amendment issue the fed shouldn't be
[18:28:26.680 --> 18:28:30.040]  in the States they shouldn't be doing all these armed raids but again it's
[18:28:30.040 --> 18:28:33.160]  about them totally controlling every fast of our lives now they're gonna have
[18:28:33.160 --> 18:28:37.200]  for folks with gardens growing tomatoes I mean this is this is what it is to be
[18:28:37.200 --> 18:28:41.280]  a prisoner they're trying to turn America into a prison right now and the
[18:28:41.280 --> 18:28:45.440]  jail guards of the TSA now go on the streets and their little PSA announcements
[18:28:45.440 --> 18:28:47.880]  everywhere about how they're gonna stick their hands down your pants to save you
[18:28:47.880 --> 18:28:52.720]  and little brainwashed idiots on power trips I mean it's just it's it's beyond
[18:28:52.720 --> 18:28:59.960]  pathetic Jason in Canada you're on the air Jason you doing Alex good I live up
[18:28:59.960 --> 18:29:06.040]  here on Georgian Bay and we've had a mass kill off of a waterfowl and there's
[18:29:06.040 --> 18:29:10.120]  been quite a bit of cover up about it the government's acknowledging the
[18:29:10.120 --> 18:29:16.200]  kill off but only in a few thousands we're talking tens of thousands moving
[18:29:16.200 --> 18:29:21.360]  out in dump trucks with front-end loaders cleaning off the beaches are you
[18:29:21.360 --> 18:29:26.880]  talking about seagulls dying no no no I'm talking about more Gansers
[18:29:26.880 --> 18:29:34.600]  cormorants you name it every kind of species of ducks you name it Canadian
[18:29:34.600 --> 18:29:41.600]  geese we got dovetails we got you name it I was out in the water and they were
[18:29:41.600 --> 18:29:45.520]  washing a shore out sailing and they were washing a shore in the thousands
[18:29:45.520 --> 18:29:49.920]  within an hour period what's amazing is when they have all these red tides now
[18:29:49.920 --> 18:29:54.800]  because the fertilizer running out of the sea and now they've been they get so
[18:29:54.800 --> 18:30:00.240]  bad you can't even breathe 20 miles in and in fact we just found an article on
[18:30:00.240 --> 18:30:02.840]  it for some reason it's blown out on screen maybe run through the other
[18:30:02.840 --> 18:30:08.200]  computer I don't know why that does that but and they had just bulldozers everywhere
[18:30:08.200 --> 18:30:11.800]  just scooping up the tens of thousands of dead fish quickly and they're telling
[18:30:11.800 --> 18:30:15.440]  everybody everything's fine it's normal it's normal that's exactly the police
[18:30:15.440 --> 18:30:20.440]  report that one out the police officer only spoke of his jurisdiction which is
[18:30:20.440 --> 18:30:25.280]  only a three kilometer stretch of 27 that's affected such like almost 20
[18:30:25.280 --> 18:30:30.520]  miles of beach where literally you can walk every every yard there's a dead
[18:30:30.520 --> 18:30:34.720]  bird and and some some places it's two or three birds per se and it's
[18:30:34.720 --> 18:30:39.640]  botulism yeah well I've been I've been looking up at we we we've sent this
[18:30:39.640 --> 18:30:44.120]  we've been going for months we're in my little embayment here and we've sent
[18:30:44.120 --> 18:30:47.400]  that stuff for the government testing over a month ago and haven't received
[18:30:47.400 --> 18:30:50.760]  anything back now there's been some strange stuff they've been sending out
[18:30:50.760 --> 18:30:57.040]  a mobile radiation monitoring teams okay these are like what do you call them
[18:30:57.040 --> 18:31:00.840]  meeting I saw a thing in Canada where the reactor was leaking a bunch but they
[18:31:00.840 --> 18:31:05.280]  said don't worry nor would this is this would be downwind of Bruce power
[18:31:05.280 --> 18:31:09.840]  essentially where I am but wait a minute wait a minute the US government has
[18:31:09.840 --> 18:31:14.840]  raised isotope levels to 100,000 times what they previously said was safe so if
[18:31:14.840 --> 18:31:19.400]  the government now says if you eat a bucket of cyanide it's good for you
[18:31:19.400 --> 18:31:23.280]  according to them it magically won't hurt you I mean 20 years ago they wouldn't

[18:34:24.560 --> 18:34:28.040]  decree and says well this isotope we're raising two thousand five hundred times
[18:34:28.040 --> 18:34:30.960]  what's safe and this one a hundred thousand times you know the EPA did that
[18:34:30.960 --> 18:34:36.240]  four or five months ago I mean if they just do that then it makes the
[18:34:36.240 --> 18:34:42.920]  radiation safe so the government could just start like saying the botulism
[18:34:42.920 --> 18:34:46.520]  does not hurt the birds and then they wouldn't involve be dying in mass as we
[18:34:46.520 --> 18:34:54.520]  just showed I mean see if DU 21 years ago couldn't be used because the Pentagon's
[18:34:54.520 --> 18:34:58.620]  own manuals we showed on air said that it ignites going out the barrel and gives
[18:34:58.620 --> 18:35:02.840]  you a deadly dose that reduces your life expectancy and causes all this cancer
[18:35:02.840 --> 18:35:07.160]  but see then the government just started ignoring that manual government
[18:35:07.160 --> 18:35:11.920]  didn't even need to write a new one saying it was safe they just ignored the
[18:35:11.920 --> 18:35:18.480]  manual I mean we just need you just need your prime minister just to to
[18:35:18.480 --> 18:35:26.560]  literally wave a magic wand you know even a magic wand just have him wave a
[18:35:26.560 --> 18:35:33.280]  magic paper bag and just say I the government say botulism does not hurt
[18:35:33.280 --> 18:35:42.320]  the birds and then yes three times does not hurt the bird and then go and then
[18:35:42.320 --> 18:35:49.080]  if you do that I see I'm starting to become sane now starting to realize the
[18:35:49.080 --> 18:35:52.680]  government love me
[18:35:52.680 --> 18:35:57.680]  oh my god I can't handle it these people are completely insane you got a bunch
[18:35:57.680 --> 18:36:01.280]  of con artists that don't give a damn and any program the scientists bring them
[18:36:01.280 --> 18:36:04.920]  to be control freaks or poison people they're like oh yes do it a little and
[18:36:04.920 --> 18:36:12.480]  it's just it's just it's just total total psycho world and they said you know
[18:36:12.480 --> 18:36:16.960]  100,000 times now that particular ice tub safe I mean they said so so they
[18:36:16.960 --> 18:36:22.520]  could say you know let's say this little thing of hot sauce and I was with my
[18:36:22.520 --> 18:36:26.960]  breakfast tacos let's say it was cyanide pure cyanide that'd be enough to
[18:36:26.960 --> 18:36:34.320]  kill about 200 people conservatively or you know 20 30 elephants but but if the
[18:36:34.320 --> 18:36:40.120]  government went like with DU or radiate no longer problem well then you can just
[18:36:40.120 --> 18:36:45.520]  drink it of course don't actually try that at home it'll kill you but I don't
[18:36:45.520 --> 18:36:50.120]  oh that was anti-government whoa that was a conspiracy theory you know now if
[18:36:50.120 --> 18:36:54.920]  you have an opinion or a view or no a fact and it goes against what our
[18:36:54.920 --> 18:37:02.440]  loving leaders are saying then it's a conspiracy theory it's kind of like
[18:37:02.440 --> 18:37:06.760]  O'Brien in 1984 torturing Winston and he says Winston you know we can suspend the
[18:37:06.760 --> 18:37:10.680]  laws of gravity when he goes no you can't he goes yeah you don't think we
[18:37:10.680 --> 18:37:14.320]  can have scientists come up with a system we'll still have another for
[18:37:14.320 --> 18:37:17.920]  navigating ships and aircraft and things but we'll have a system and you will
[18:37:17.920 --> 18:37:22.480]  believe it and the children will be taught there's no gravity or that the
[18:37:22.480 --> 18:37:27.680]  stars are only a hundred feet up the sky he says you don't believe it I'm gonna
[18:37:27.680 --> 18:37:31.320]  keep torturing you till you're totally mentally broken here let's hear but see
[18:37:31.320 --> 18:37:34.960]  they don't have to do that now they just say it's trendy and people go oh my god
[18:37:34.960 --> 18:37:40.960]  it's trendy oh then there's no gravity you know oh cyanide's good for you do
[18:37:40.960 --> 18:37:47.880]  you know okay let's let's let's go to this video report on braining
[18:37:47.880 --> 18:37:51.320]  vaccines because soon they see they'll be able to re-engineer your brain they're
[18:37:51.320 --> 18:37:54.720]  announcing this so you will believe whatever they say and no more
[18:37:54.720 --> 18:37:59.680]  depression no more pain no the government this take the body snatcher shot
[18:37:59.680 --> 18:38:03.120]  it's for the children oh when you you don't want to take the shot they're
[18:38:03.120 --> 18:38:07.040]  releasing the mosquitoes little it'll give you the loving nanotech that's what
[18:38:07.040 --> 18:38:11.520]  it is an engineered virus it's basically nanotech and that re-engineers your
[18:38:11.520 --> 18:38:14.680]  brain and oh they're coming out with it with it it'll be fortified in the
[18:38:14.680 --> 18:38:20.720]  vegetables and the police will come by and they'll make sure you do it because
[18:38:20.720 --> 18:38:26.960]  after all after you've had this there's gonna be no more pain nothing but loving

[18:38:46.520 --> 18:38:54.440]  this this show is extremism the show is in is insane this show doesn't think that
[18:38:54.440 --> 18:39:04.000]  1984 is an instruction manual please Janet Napolitano cares about you by the
[18:39:04.000 --> 18:39:08.160]  way in 20 minutes the beds are over at eBay for charity crusher to you can find
[18:39:08.160 --> 18:39:12.360]  a link to it at m4's money bomb dot com we'll be back in about 15 minutes to
[18:39:12.360 --> 18:39:18.440]  kick off the official transmission the final three hours and we're awaiting a
[18:39:18.440 --> 18:39:22.000]  call from Jesse Ventura who in an hour and 20 months from now sitting over
[18:39:22.000 --> 18:39:25.080]  press commerce we are trying to get a local news feed and carry that if we can
[18:39:25.080 --> 18:39:33.360]  we got Alan Watt coming up we got a lot more so Jim Mars but maybe if the
[18:39:33.360 --> 18:39:38.120]  government says Jim Mars doesn't exist even to be standing right there in all
[18:39:38.120 --> 18:39:47.000]  of his resplendent garden no mishness then he doesn't the government loves
[18:39:47.000 --> 18:39:58.440]  me it's all happy all right let's go ahead and go to that table here is my
[18:39:58.440 --> 18:40:02.800]  friends please pay attention to the information about to cover and research
[18:40:02.800 --> 18:40:06.960]  the links that will post below this video so you understand none of this is my
[18:40:06.960 --> 18:40:12.160]  opinion it is fact this issue is the most important issue going on in the
[18:40:12.160 --> 18:40:16.800]  world it is scientific tyranny I've read literally hundreds of government
[18:40:16.800 --> 18:40:20.280]  white papers and documents and books like eco science with a white house
[18:40:20.280 --> 18:40:23.520]  science are talks about forcibly drugging the water to dumb you down and
[18:40:23.520 --> 18:40:29.280]  sterilize you but now they're in the New York Times and Time magazine and
[18:40:29.280 --> 18:40:34.080]  everywhere and all the major medical journals promoting not only drugging the
[18:40:34.080 --> 18:40:37.360]  water with lithium which by the way they're already doing but now they're
[18:40:37.360 --> 18:40:42.640]  announcing it to make you servile but now they are admitting that they plan to
[18:40:42.640 --> 18:40:46.960]  deploy something I learned about a decade ago hundreds of different
[18:40:46.960 --> 18:40:54.400]  vaccines they're really biological re-engineering live viruses that they
[18:40:54.400 --> 18:41:02.400]  inject into your body and the live viruses go in and attack your brain and
[18:41:02.400 --> 18:41:08.320]  they claim oh it's to stop drug addiction those same receptor sites that
[18:41:08.320 --> 18:41:13.280]  pick up opiates and nicotine and alcohol pick up your normal endorphins it's
[18:41:13.280 --> 18:41:17.760]  part of being a normal human being those drugs mimic that and the viruses
[18:41:17.760 --> 18:41:23.200]  attack those receptor sites and kill them and create dead tissue it is a
[18:41:23.200 --> 18:41:30.320]  vaccine induced live virus lobotomy now they're coming out and saying the
[18:41:30.320 --> 18:41:34.160]  American people and the people of the world are sick and major medical
[18:41:34.160 --> 18:41:37.840]  journals are saying we need to give everybody these shots to make them feel
[18:41:37.840 --> 18:41:44.880]  better to stop having anxiety to stop being angry in other words to take away
[18:41:44.880 --> 18:41:51.440]  your instinct for self-preservation your will to survive to make you accept all
[18:41:51.440 --> 18:41:55.680]  the bad things that are happening to turn you into a biological android a type
[18:41:55.680 --> 18:42:02.240]  of zombie you cannot make this up please send this video to everyone you know
[18:42:02.240 --> 18:42:07.440]  for god's sakes understand how serious this is this is a global scientific
[18:42:07.440 --> 18:42:11.840]  corporate takeover of life itself the globalists aren't just re-engineering
[18:42:11.840 --> 18:42:15.680]  corn and wheat and every other major crop and engineering sterile and send to
[18:42:15.680 --> 18:42:21.680]  them suddenly all over the news they're promoting lithium and prozac and other
[18:42:21.680 --> 18:42:25.840]  drugs in the water head bioethicist at Cambridge
[18:42:25.840 --> 18:42:29.840]  they're the people that advise and set medical policy for doctors
[18:42:29.840 --> 18:42:33.680]  are announcing they want to force drug you and they're calling it cognitive
[18:42:33.680 --> 18:42:39.200]  enhancement i've got a cbs news piece where they say that mercury helps your
[18:42:39.200 --> 18:42:42.880]  intelligence when everyone knows it causes brain damage mercury containing
[18:42:42.880 --> 18:42:47.280]  vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[18:42:47.280 --> 18:42:53.280]  pediatrics so when they say cognitive enhancement they mean cognitive brain
[18:42:53.280 --> 18:42:59.680]  damage they mean taking your essence literally your psyche who you are away
[18:42:59.680 --> 18:43:03.280]  and they sit up there saying well if we put prozac in the water it'll cut
[18:43:03.280 --> 18:43:06.480]  suicide when it's admitted that prozac on its insert
[18:43:06.480 --> 18:43:10.000]  can cause suicide i have mainstream news articles that have just come out in the
[18:43:10.000 --> 18:43:15.200]  last few days in england where people have a 10 fold increase in convulsions
[18:43:15.200 --> 18:43:18.800]  and they develop epilepsy after the flu shot
[18:43:18.800 --> 18:43:23.840]  i talked to top scientists who studied the flu shot last year and found bizarre
[18:43:23.840 --> 18:43:27.440]  viral RNA in it that deals with the brain
[18:43:27.440 --> 18:43:31.440]  i've had top brain surgeons on like dr rustle blalock to talk about this
[18:43:31.440 --> 18:43:34.880]  and the government documents that he's read how this is part of the eugenics
[18:43:34.880 --> 18:43:38.160]  population control program i mean here it is
[18:43:38.160 --> 18:43:42.400]  london telegraph flu jab linked to fits and under fives
[18:43:42.400 --> 18:43:45.680]  and it goes on to say they've been told not to give children 110,000 in england
[18:43:45.680 --> 18:43:49.440]  or five the shot because they had convulsions at 10
[18:43:49.440 --> 18:43:54.400]  times the regular rate. Lindsay Lohan isn't what matters
[18:43:54.400 --> 18:43:58.720]  mel Gibson isn't what matters the depression doesn't even matter war with
[18:43:58.720 --> 18:44:02.800]  iran is not even that important compared to a medical
[18:44:02.800 --> 18:44:06.240]  dictatorship and under the national health service in england and now
[18:44:06.240 --> 18:44:09.840]  national health care here in the us they're slashing regular health care
[18:44:09.840 --> 18:44:13.120]  like cancer surgery or having a broken leg fixed
[18:44:13.120 --> 18:44:19.120]  and converting it over to psychiatry and this biological warfare or biopsychiatry
[18:44:19.120 --> 18:44:22.240]  where they say don't worry about drugs anymore for your depression
[18:44:22.240 --> 18:44:25.600]  we're going to give you a shot that alters your brain
[18:44:25.600 --> 18:44:29.520]  by viruses literally attacking your brain
[18:44:29.520 --> 18:44:32.800]  and they're rolling it out in public trials
[18:44:32.800 --> 18:44:37.920]  over 100 of these vaccines right now and they're clearly spiking other
[18:44:37.920 --> 18:44:41.760]  vaccines with it if you love your children if you love your family
[18:44:41.760 --> 18:44:44.800]  you've got to realize this is a creeping scientific
[18:44:44.800 --> 18:44:50.160]  incremental soft kill system let's go over some of these articles
[18:44:50.160 --> 18:44:54.640]  jab that could put a stop to stress without slowing us down
[18:44:54.640 --> 18:44:57.760]  and it says they're going to make humans better they've re-engineered
[18:44:57.760 --> 18:45:02.000]  potatoes and corn why not just re-engineered humans
[18:45:02.000 --> 18:45:07.200]  and they quote all these major medical journals saying how great it is
[18:45:07.200 --> 18:45:11.760]  and they say this could change society the professor said and they have a
[18:45:11.760 --> 18:45:14.800]  government funded stanford team with these
[18:45:14.800 --> 18:45:20.880]  neuroprotective viruses and this particular vaccine one of hundreds
[18:45:20.880 --> 18:45:29.280]  is a live herpes virus engineered to only eat certain key brain tissue
[18:45:29.280 --> 18:45:34.960]  what's wrong nothing nothing really i just feel like i need something stronger
[18:45:34.960 --> 18:45:38.640]  if you have a problem don't hesitate to ask for assistance
[18:45:38.640 --> 18:45:42.720]  it's nice of you all right call 348 they're not asking you
[18:45:42.720 --> 18:45:45.600]  they're just rolling it out and this isn't like some
[18:45:45.600 --> 18:45:49.280]  uh drug that they give people for a decade that causes hundreds of thousands
[18:45:49.280 --> 18:45:53.200]  of women to have deformed children this isn't some drug that just makes one
[18:45:53.200 --> 18:45:57.360]  person you know have a heart attack all these other recall drugs these aren't
[18:45:57.360 --> 18:46:00.400]  even drugs these are genetically engineered
[18:46:00.400 --> 18:46:06.880]  nanotech viruses that go in and turn you into a servile biological
[18:46:06.880 --> 18:46:11.680]  android do you understand the vaccines that they're rolling out
[18:46:11.680 --> 18:46:17.840]  are live virus bio weapons that re-engineer your brain
[18:46:17.840 --> 18:46:21.440]  you've seen the reports where all over the world asia
[18:46:21.440 --> 18:46:25.680]  africa latin america central asia they give children
[18:46:25.680 --> 18:46:31.360]  un sanctioned polio shots and the children come down with weaponized polio
[18:46:31.360 --> 18:46:35.280]  and die and the government admits oh it was an accident with that vaccine
[18:46:35.280 --> 18:46:38.880]  people are now waking up to the fact that the vaccines are causing convulsions
[18:46:38.880 --> 18:46:42.480]  and brain damage and cancer and so what's their answer they're coming out and
[18:46:42.480 --> 18:46:47.440]  saying don't worry instead of a shot have a banana
[18:46:47.440 --> 18:46:51.120]  they're coming out nobel laureate scientist defines
[18:46:51.120 --> 18:46:56.320]  future vaccines as food they're pharmacological crops that grow
[18:46:56.320 --> 18:47:00.560]  the live virus whether it gives you cancer or gives you polio
[18:47:00.560 --> 18:47:04.880]  or literally sends viruses in to eat parts of your brain
[18:47:04.880 --> 18:47:08.560]  it's all being done bill gates is coming out with a biologically engineered
[18:47:08.560 --> 18:47:12.480]  mosquito to forcibly deliver vaccines to you
[18:47:12.480 --> 18:47:16.640]  there's new drug discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's
[18:47:16.640 --> 18:47:20.000]  going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months
[18:47:20.000 --> 18:47:24.000]  and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective
[18:47:24.000 --> 18:47:27.680]  and most secondly over and over again they claim oh it's to make you not
[18:47:27.680 --> 18:47:30.960]  depressed anymore all of you have problems you shouldn't be upset about
[18:47:30.960 --> 18:47:34.560]  things and we're meant to get upset at a biological level and say no to this
[18:47:34.560 --> 18:47:37.280]  tyranny and so they're coming out saying oh we're
[18:47:37.280 --> 18:47:40.000]  going to re-engineer your brain cognitive enhancements
[18:47:40.000 --> 18:47:44.160]  we're going to help you the mercury's helping your brain
[18:47:44.160 --> 18:47:49.280]  on newscasts all over the country oh the convulsions are helping you
[18:47:49.280 --> 18:47:53.440]  oh lithium a toxic metal that they want to put in the water it's
[18:47:53.440 --> 18:47:56.480]  helping you you're going to feel much better
[18:47:56.480 --> 18:48:01.440]  after all of this is done what's wrong
[18:48:02.960 --> 18:48:06.320]  they're not coming for us they're already here
[18:48:06.320 --> 18:48:10.080]  we're in danger many of you who have a child
[18:48:10.080 --> 18:48:13.920]  who seems to be dumbed down it isn't as smart as anybody else in your family
[18:48:13.920 --> 18:48:17.680]  and something's wrong with them it's the vaccines it's the gmo food
[18:48:17.680 --> 18:48:20.720]  many of you who had an 18 month old baby who was healthy and happy
[18:48:20.720 --> 18:48:24.160]  they take that third round of shots they have a convulsion that night and they
[18:48:24.160 --> 18:48:27.520]  never talk again they're turning you into servile
[18:48:27.520 --> 18:48:30.960]  minions who will do whatever you're told and who can't get angry
[18:48:30.960 --> 18:48:34.080]  and can't resist why do they want lithium in the water
[18:48:34.080 --> 18:48:38.000]  they admit to make you submit what does sodium fluoride all the studies do
[18:48:38.000 --> 18:48:42.400]  make you submit and what do these vaccines do they make you passive
[18:48:42.400 --> 18:48:46.560]  they make you unable to get angry anger is a propulsion system to make you
[18:48:46.560 --> 18:48:50.240]  stand up for your species this is a hostile corporate takeover the
[18:48:50.240 --> 18:48:53.280]  very genetic code of not just the plants and animals
[18:48:53.280 --> 18:48:56.800]  but humanity itself it is the most diabolical
[18:48:56.800 --> 18:49:01.120]  covert operation ever seen and now these people
[18:49:01.120 --> 18:49:05.760]  are out in the open it's admitted do you understand
[18:49:05.760 --> 18:49:10.320]  it's admitted they want to make these shots mandatory in public schools
[18:49:10.320 --> 18:49:14.480]  to make you servile oh but you don't want to become addicted to drugs
[18:49:14.480 --> 18:49:18.320]  what do you think drugs mimic they mimic natural chemicals in the brain
[18:49:18.320 --> 18:49:24.480]  that stir creativity and anger and love and everything else it's those key
[18:49:24.480 --> 18:49:28.640]  receptors they're literally going for the soul of man
[18:49:28.640 --> 18:49:32.880]  that is in the beautiful detailed complex
[18:49:32.880 --> 18:49:37.440]  computer that is the human mind this is a hack against the human mind
[18:49:37.440 --> 18:49:41.200]  a hack against the human soul and we must stand up and resist it
[18:49:41.200 --> 18:49:44.880]  they realize there's a worldwide revolt against this
[18:49:44.880 --> 18:49:47.840]  technocracy against dehumanization you need to
[18:49:47.840 --> 18:49:51.600]  become educated on these facts and join the resistance
[18:49:51.600 --> 18:49:56.240]  against this scientific dictatorship now is the time to realize
[18:49:56.240 --> 18:49:59.840]  that history is taking place right now that we're living
[18:49:59.840 --> 18:50:05.520]  in the 21st century and a scientific tyranny has taken over
[18:50:05.520 --> 18:50:08.880]  if we are successful in defeating these people
[18:50:08.880 --> 18:50:13.280]  historians will look back on this time as the greatest covert genocide in
[18:50:13.280 --> 18:50:16.240]  history they will look back on it as the
[18:50:16.240 --> 18:50:20.240]  ultimate example of pure evil and corruption
[18:50:20.240 --> 18:50:23.360]  this creeping death now i've warned the public
[18:50:23.360 --> 18:50:26.960]  and i will continue to detail what's happening in areas where lithium in
[18:50:26.960 --> 18:50:30.960]  trace amounts is in the drinking water there seems to be a lower level of
[18:50:30.960 --> 18:50:34.000]  suicidality and in the texas counties that were
[18:50:34.000 --> 18:50:37.120]  studied there's actually lower crime rate and how these enemies come out and
[18:50:37.120 --> 18:50:41.280]  talk in their simpering lisping tones real softly to
[18:50:41.280 --> 18:50:45.040]  to coax you and and and and advertise all this
[18:50:45.040 --> 18:50:48.320]  death and dehumanization as if it's good the theory is that
[18:50:48.320 --> 18:50:51.760]  very low or trace amounts of lithium enhance connectivity
[18:50:51.760 --> 18:50:55.200]  between neurons and doing that over the course of a lifetime
[18:50:55.200 --> 18:50:59.600]  a lifetime exposure makes the brain more healthy
[18:50:59.600 --> 18:51:03.360]  now i want to talk to the social engineers whose religion
[18:51:03.360 --> 18:51:07.840]  is a control freak system of dehumanization
[18:51:07.840 --> 18:51:11.280]  you are like cancer you're racing through the body politic you think
[18:51:11.280 --> 18:51:14.640]  you're invincible and you may kill the host you may
[18:51:14.640 --> 18:51:18.080]  destroy our species but not without a fight
[18:51:18.080 --> 18:51:22.720]  you are disgusting wicked people who love ruling over others
[18:51:22.720 --> 18:51:26.080]  everything you do creates death and destruction in its path
[18:51:26.080 --> 18:51:29.360]  you sold prozac as a way to stop depression when in your own trials you
[18:51:29.360 --> 18:51:33.040]  knew it massively increased suicide now you're telling us how great
[18:51:33.040 --> 18:51:37.200]  lithium and toxic metal an anti-psychotic is going to be
[18:51:37.200 --> 18:51:40.880]  putting the water mandatory and we've got the studies it's already in most the
[18:51:40.880 --> 18:51:44.240]  water supplies we know you're adding it you are sickening
[18:51:44.240 --> 18:51:47.760]  disgusting filth and we're going to rally the world
[18:51:47.760 --> 18:51:51.360]  population against you and we're going to bring you to justice
[18:51:51.360 --> 18:51:55.440]  and i pray god that humanity makes it through what you've attempted to do how
[18:51:55.440 --> 18:51:58.800]  you've saddled up next to us like a spider in the dark and tried to
[18:51:58.800 --> 18:52:03.680]  spin your webs of control around us while we were asleep but the sleeping
[18:52:03.680 --> 18:52:07.600]  giant that is humanity is waking up to who you are and what you are
[18:52:07.600 --> 18:52:11.760]  and i pray to the creator of the universe and i beg for just the average
[18:52:11.760 --> 18:52:15.840]  person out there as well to research just who you are
[18:52:15.840 --> 18:52:19.600]  and how you're involved in a scorched earth takeover of society
[18:52:19.600 --> 18:52:23.120]  to secure your ill-gotten gains and i want you to know
[18:52:23.120 --> 18:52:26.480]  that i'm going to do everything i can to rally free humanity
[18:52:26.480 --> 18:52:29.600]  against you and that we are going to defeat you
[18:52:29.600 --> 18:52:34.000]  but whether we win or not whether you lose or fail
[18:52:34.000 --> 18:52:37.440]  at least we were real humans we were good decent people
[18:52:37.440 --> 18:52:41.200]  that saw the truth and we stood up against you and no matter what happens
[18:52:41.200 --> 18:52:46.560]  in this you are still degenerate dehumanizing filth
[18:52:46.560 --> 18:52:51.200]  you are aberrant malfunctioning trash and you look at everything good and
[18:52:51.200 --> 18:52:54.880]  wholesome and tell us that we are malfunctioning
[18:52:54.880 --> 18:52:58.160]  so i pray that you be defeated but either way
[18:52:58.160 --> 18:53:03.040]  in this time and space on this planet good people stood up against what you
[18:53:03.040 --> 18:53:06.080]  are and did everything they could to help the innocence
[18:53:06.080 --> 18:53:09.120]  when i look at all the children that you've brain damaged
[18:53:09.120 --> 18:53:12.880]  and all the children dying of cancer and i look at all the things that you've
[18:53:12.880 --> 18:53:17.280]  done to humanity it makes me want to vomit you are doing this
[18:53:17.280 --> 18:53:21.600]  because this is only the next wave to first neutralize us so we're calm and
[18:53:21.600 --> 18:53:25.760]  sedate and can't resist so you can roll in with the hard kill weapons
[18:53:25.760 --> 18:53:28.880]  i know that and i want to tell you something else
[18:53:28.880 --> 18:53:32.240]  a lot of you that think that you're part of the winning team
[18:53:32.240 --> 18:53:34.880]  you're going to find out that your masters hate you more than they even
[18:53:34.880 --> 18:53:37.600]  hate free humanity because they know that you know where the
[18:53:37.600 --> 18:53:40.880]  bodies are buried and they know you're a bunch of wicked control freaks
[18:53:40.880 --> 18:53:44.480]  that they need to kill first once they take over or you'll start trying to
[18:53:44.480 --> 18:53:47.200]  overthrow them they understand your nature
[18:53:47.200 --> 18:53:51.040]  they use their propaganda to manipulate good men throughout history to serve
[18:53:51.040 --> 18:53:55.600]  their evil aims so understand this you're going to fail one way or
[18:53:55.600 --> 18:53:58.080]  another you've decided to put your soul on the
[18:53:58.080 --> 18:54:02.080]  side of darkness for all eternity for what you're doing to humanity and
[18:54:02.080 --> 18:54:06.240]  butchering our dna and literally mutating the human
[18:54:06.240 --> 18:54:09.440]  spirit and your control freak lust for power
[18:54:09.440 --> 18:54:12.960]  and so all of you one way or another will fail
[18:54:12.960 --> 18:54:16.960]  so all that matters is in this time and space i stood up for what's right
[18:54:16.960 --> 18:54:22.160]  i saw you clearly for what you are and i know in my heart there's a very good
[18:54:22.160 --> 18:54:25.440]  chance we're going to beat you but that's up to all the people out there
[18:54:25.440 --> 18:54:28.560]  watching this do they have the courage to face the facts
[18:54:28.560 --> 18:54:33.040]  do they have the courage to take action if you feel you are not properly
[18:54:33.040 --> 18:54:39.600]  sedated call 348-844 immediately failure to do
[18:54:39.600 --> 18:54:57.360]  so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion
[18:54:57.360 --> 18:55:02.000]  this is our land
[18:55:02.000 --> 18:55:07.200]  these are our people the workers
[18:55:07.200 --> 18:55:11.840]  the strikers the builders
