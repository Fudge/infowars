[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.880]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.880 --> 00:17.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.040 --> 00:22.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.840 --> 00:32.440]  It's Tuesday, November 20.
[00:32.440 --> 00:34.120]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34.120 --> 00:38.040]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, filling in today for the first hour.
[00:38.040 --> 00:40.680]  Alex is out sick, so the first hour will be me.
[00:40.680 --> 00:46.400]  I've got some special guests coming up, and the second two hours of the show will be rebroadcast,
[00:46.400 --> 00:53.560]  but it's day two of the opt-out and film week. The backlash against the TSA continues.
[00:53.560 --> 00:59.160]  And at the bottom of the hour, we're going to be talking with Dan Dix and Press for Truth TV.
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.800]  And TSA opt-out and film campaign organizer, Ashley Jessica.
[01:04.800 --> 01:07.400]  You probably heard them on the show yesterday briefly.
[01:07.400 --> 01:16.160]  They traveled to Buffalo Airport there in New York and basically ran into some hassle.
[01:16.160 --> 01:19.200]  They were expecting it, of course, with the TSA.
[01:19.200 --> 01:21.720]  The police got involved from what I hear.
[01:21.720 --> 01:26.160]  Don't know the full details of it, but I'm definitely fascinated to find out.
[01:26.160 --> 01:29.120]  So we're going to be talking to them at the bottom of the hour.
[01:29.120 --> 01:34.120]  They were involved in the TSA opt-out and film campaign protest.
[01:34.120 --> 01:39.840]  And we're also going to be talking to a father who's running with the TSA, led to his baby
[01:39.840 --> 01:46.600]  son laying face down on the floor, bleeding. Wait until you hear about this one.
[01:46.600 --> 01:49.400]  We're going to go to that here in the next segment.
[01:49.400 --> 01:54.320]  Kicking off with some news, though, and obviously the TSA's in the frame here.
[01:54.320 --> 01:56.600]  This is up on infowars.com.
[01:56.600 --> 02:02.560]  Cancer victim forced to go through TSA body scanner despite opting out.
[02:02.560 --> 02:06.480]  Now this is an email I received about two hours before going on air.
[02:06.480 --> 02:12.840]  I also received another email from a traveler yesterday saying basically the same thing.
[02:12.840 --> 02:19.800]  And it appears as if, in some cases, the TSA is actually forcing people to go through the
[02:19.800 --> 02:27.040]  naked X-ray radiation firing body scanners, even though they exercise their right, and
[02:27.040 --> 02:30.840]  it is their right within the United States, to opt out.
[02:30.840 --> 02:35.840]  They're actually forcing them, lying to them against their own TSA policy and saying that
[02:35.840 --> 02:41.520]  you have to go through the scanner, it's mandatory, when of course we know it's not.
[02:41.520 --> 02:46.040]  And this was a cancer victim concerned with, I mean, she's in remission now, but she was
[02:46.040 --> 02:49.800]  concerned by the effects of the radiation scanner.
[02:49.800 --> 02:53.840]  And she emailed me today to say, quote, I was in the New Orleans airport and asked to
[02:53.840 --> 02:55.000]  opt out.
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.360]  They made me go through the X-ray and I had to go through a pat down.
[02:59.360 --> 03:05.280]  So even though she went through the body scanner, she got the invasive grope down anyway.
[03:05.280 --> 03:10.240]  I'm sure that this is in violation of the TSA's policy, of course we know that's true.
[03:10.240 --> 03:16.600]  I was reduced to tears, writes Lynn Baker, quote, I wish I had the video, but I wanted
[03:16.600 --> 03:18.640]  to pass this along even without.
[03:18.640 --> 03:23.800]  It shouldn't make any difference, but I have cancer and do not want the scans to trigger
[03:23.800 --> 03:29.000]  the cancer, as I am currently in remission, she adds.
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.240]  So basically this is a cancer victim who was in tears crying because when she legally
[03:35.240 --> 03:40.640]  exercised her right to opt out of the radiation firing body scanner, she was told in no uncertain
[03:40.640 --> 03:45.400]  terms by the TSA agent, get in the scanner now, we're going to make you do it.
[03:45.400 --> 03:51.080]  And obviously, you know, if you've got guys being arrested as terrorists, as bombers for
[03:51.080 --> 03:57.880]  having an artistic watch as happened on the weekend, they're being arrested as potential
[03:57.880 --> 04:04.880]  terrorists, their bail has been set at, you know, $150,000, then there's a very significant
[04:04.880 --> 04:11.040]  pull to obey whatever the TSA agent says, because of course you could be labeled a terrorist
[04:11.040 --> 04:17.320]  just as during the last national opt-out day protest back in 2010, which of course the
[04:17.320 --> 04:22.800]  TSA responded to by mothballing the scanners on that very day as a political stunt to try
[04:22.800 --> 04:28.680]  and neutralise the protest, people who opted out during that time were also characterised
[04:28.680 --> 04:29.680]  as terrorists.
[04:29.680 --> 04:34.640]  In fact, there was a segment on the view, the popular ABC show where, you know, whoopee
[04:34.640 --> 04:40.680]  Goldberg and all the others on the show actually called people terrorists or potential terrorists
[04:40.680 --> 04:45.360]  simply for exercising their right to opt out.
[04:45.360 --> 04:52.680]  So we're going to continue speaking about this after a break with our guest, Kevin Ryan
[04:52.680 --> 04:58.880]  who was the father who went through TSA security with his wife, with his baby son, and that
[04:58.880 --> 04:59.880]  happened after the break.
[04:59.880 --> 05:04.200]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from cold flus and other illnesses.
[05:04.200 --> 05:06.440]  Make sure you're not one of them.
[05:06.440 --> 05:11.040]  Supernatural silver is a new technology that is highly effective against the germs, bacteria
[05:11.040 --> 05:14.520]  and fungus that can breed in your chest, throat and sinuses.
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.880]  Kill off these germs and allow your immune system to become stronger with supernatural
[05:18.880 --> 05:19.880]  silver.
[05:19.880 --> 05:23.960]  It's a powerful new silver solution that is several hundred times more effective than
[05:23.960 --> 05:26.880]  colloidal or ionic silvers.
[05:26.880 --> 05:30.680]  Supernatural silver can be taken daily for prevention and will not create resistant
[05:30.680 --> 05:31.680]  bacteria.
[05:31.680 --> 05:36.040]  It is non-toxic and is proven to be effective against many of the most serious diseases
[05:36.040 --> 05:42.440]  out there today, such as resistant staph, strep, pneumonia, viruses and flus.
[05:42.440 --> 05:46.960]  Supernatural silver is a safe and effective way to fight pathogens where antibiotics and
[05:46.960 --> 05:50.040]  other drugs fail, have it on hand for any emergency.

[06:44.680 --> 06:47.560]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[06:47.560 --> 06:52.360]  The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing

[08:00.240 --> 08:06.160]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[08:06.160 --> 08:15.840]  a war on for your mind.
[08:15.840 --> 08:20.280]  Go back on the Alex Jones show, it's Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones who is out
[08:20.280 --> 08:22.560]  sick he'll be back tomorrow.
[08:22.560 --> 08:27.200]  CEN8 bill rewrite lets feds read your email without warrants this is one of the top stories
[08:27.200 --> 08:33.040]  up at prisonplanet.com and basically they've rewritten this email surveillance bill which
[08:33.040 --> 08:38.200]  is now being introduced in the CEN8 and it's worse than the first version which people
[08:38.200 --> 08:40.120]  were already complaining about.
[08:40.120 --> 08:47.960]  This bill would allow 22 no less than 22 federal agencies to read your private emails but not
[08:47.960 --> 08:54.160]  only that Google Doc files, Facebook posts, direct Twitter messages, these are private
[08:54.160 --> 09:00.720]  messages would allow 22 federal agencies to read all those communications without a warrant
[09:00.720 --> 09:07.280]  without having to go to a judge whatsoever so big brothers tentacles really reaching
[09:07.280 --> 09:12.400]  further and further of course under the echelon system a lot of that communication is trapped
[09:12.400 --> 09:18.560]  90% of all email and internet traffic is trapped and later analyzed with keyword systems but
[09:18.560 --> 09:23.720]  now they're openly coming out and saying let the feds read your email without a warrant
[09:23.720 --> 09:30.560]  in plain view just as they did with Mr. Petraeus there revealing his affair so that's up on
[09:30.560 --> 09:32.960]  prisonplanet.com.
[09:32.960 --> 09:37.640]  Another story we've got up on there is TSA issues warning over opt out and film week
[09:37.640 --> 09:43.400]  and the TSA has officially acknowledged the info was opt out and film protest and warned
[09:43.400 --> 09:49.080]  that despite the fact that it is prohibited not prohibited to film the TSA at checkpoints
[09:49.080 --> 09:55.240]  local laws may allow police to intervene and prevent such activity so basically the TSA
[09:55.240 --> 10:00.560]  came out in a blog post and said yeah our own policy says you can film there's nothing
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.680]  wrong with it but if you do we may get the police involved and you have to obey local
[10:05.680 --> 10:11.200]  ordinances of course the first court of appeals has repeatedly ruled that it is completely
[10:11.200 --> 10:18.280]  legal under the First Amendment to film police officers TSA officials are not police officers
[10:18.280 --> 10:23.080]  they have to go through zero training yet they're called officers and given a nice shiny
[10:23.080 --> 10:29.200]  gold metal badge but they're basically threatening anyone who takes part in this protest they're
[10:29.200 --> 10:33.680]  trying to intimidate them out of doing so by saying the police are going to get involved
[10:33.680 --> 10:37.920]  which is what we're going to get into at the bottom of the hour with Dan Dix and Ashley
[10:37.920 --> 10:44.000]  Jessica but now I want to introduce our first guest and this is an email I received probably
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.360]  a couple of weeks ago now we received shocking stories about the TSA the behaviour of the
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.240]  TSA of course they're in the news on an almost daily basis but this one really shocked me
[10:54.240 --> 11:00.760]  because it involved a toddler and here to talk about it is the father of that child
[11:00.760 --> 11:05.000]  Kevin Ryan welcome to the show Kevin.
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.400]  Thank you Paul it's a pleasure to be on the show unfortunately I wish that there wasn't
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.000]  a need to be on the show I wish what happened had happened but thank you very much for
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.920]  having me.
[11:15.920 --> 11:20.160]  Now Kevin this incident occurred at Newark Liberty airport you were there with your
[11:20.160 --> 11:25.520]  wife and baby you've transferred to another terminal this was in the Continental Airlines
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.920]  terminal and you're on your way to Baltimore you're approaching the TSA security checkpoint
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.640]  now take the story from there tell us what happened.
[11:34.640 --> 11:39.160]  Yeah well exactly as you said we had just arrived from an international flight and we
[11:39.160 --> 11:44.440]  had transferred over to the Continental terminal for a connecting flight to bottom work it
[11:44.440 --> 11:52.840]  was quite late at night for the airport about 9 30 p.m. as we approached the TSA checkpoint
[11:52.840 --> 12:01.280]  we were the only people but we were immediately accosted I guess by the TSA they began shouting
[12:01.280 --> 12:07.880]  at us to move along faster to remove our shoes and other personal items at a faster speed
[12:07.880 --> 12:14.400]  despite their aggressive behaviour we remained very respectful and proceeded with what their
[12:14.400 --> 12:22.440]  their commands were I had been carrying our son in a portable baby cradle I had sat him
[12:22.440 --> 12:29.440]  down on the table before the x-ray to remove him from that cradle at which time I was being
[12:29.440 --> 12:35.480]  constantly yelled at that I was not allowed to do that there you know there was no idea
[12:35.480 --> 12:40.080]  as far as how I how I was to remove him from the cradle without putting him down but I
[12:40.080 --> 12:46.320]  guess that was that was my problem I proceeded to remove him from the cradle and went underneath
[12:46.320 --> 12:56.840]  the x-ray with him and at that point my wife had remained behind with a cradle in our personal
[12:56.840 --> 13:07.960]  belongings and apparently the cradle at that point had been pushed through the x-ray conveyor
[13:07.960 --> 13:15.880]  belt unbeknownst to me when it arrived on the other side of the x-ray I had sent it again
[13:15.880 --> 13:24.080]  to place my son into his portable baby cradle and was again harassed and told that I wasn't
[13:24.080 --> 13:31.040]  allowed to do that here and that I had to proceed to leave immediately without fastening my son
[13:31.040 --> 13:37.760]  into his cradle or having time really to collect my my personal items so doing the best I could
[13:37.760 --> 13:47.120]  I had sat my son in the cradle and began to proceed away from the conveyor belt area as
[13:47.120 --> 13:54.960]  instructed by the TSA at that point just after picking up my my son and walking baby three
[13:54.960 --> 14:01.560]  to five feet away from the conveyor belt he fell out of the cradle one reason for that
[14:01.560 --> 14:06.320]  being they wasn't fastened in another reason being that they had apparently broken the
[14:06.320 --> 14:14.320]  cradle as you saw your wife had saw the cradle trying to advise me but was pulled aside by
[14:14.320 --> 14:19.200]  the TSA and told us she cannot speak and allow tone at the TSA area although apparently
[14:19.200 --> 14:25.400]  they are allowed to and that she had been singled out for a special a special security check
[14:25.400 --> 14:34.160]  my son had fell on the ground and was bleeding and of course crying ostensibly there was
[14:34.160 --> 14:41.400]  blood coming out of his nose his lip was busted he was bleeding and really it's you know
[14:41.400 --> 14:49.440]  looked quite quite horrible we were panicked I tried to call 911 having just come over
[14:49.440 --> 14:56.520]  from a trip to Europe my cell phone when I work I asked repeatedly in a very loud and
[14:56.520 --> 15:05.040]  clear voice to the two TSA employees to contact 911 and they acted as if they didn't see me
[15:05.040 --> 15:10.080]  they just went about their business sort of looked at me rolled their eyes meanwhile my
[15:10.080 --> 15:20.280]  baby is shouting and crying and bleeding so it's quite a horrific scene and the really
[15:20.280 --> 15:26.880]  our salvation was a janitor who came rushing over and allowed us to use her cell phone
[15:26.880 --> 15:34.640]  to to call 911 which should come and then transport our son to a nearby emergency room
[15:34.640 --> 15:39.760]  and so basically there was no there's hardly anybody in the line this wasn't as if it was
[15:39.760 --> 15:44.720]  a busy morning and yet still at half nine at night they're there right from the start
[15:44.720 --> 15:50.160]  shouting at you bawling at you to get a move on when you've clearly got all this baby equipment
[15:50.160 --> 15:53.960]  you're tired you're traveling through the airport and you said your wife actually saw
[15:53.960 --> 15:59.600]  them break the baby cradle is that right when they put it through the scanner that's correct
[15:59.600 --> 16:05.200]  while in fact there was nobody else in the line were the only people there and she did
[16:05.200 --> 16:11.360]  see what had what had occurred and she was not allowed to advise me of that I just just
[16:11.360 --> 16:16.600]  want to mention it as a side point the treatment that we received by the TSA was was quite different
[16:16.600 --> 16:22.360]  what we then what we received going through to European airports where these security
[16:22.360 --> 16:28.760]  staff there which certainly is concerned about security as well were very polite and made
[16:28.760 --> 16:34.320]  special considerations for the fact that we were traveling with a infant's baby I mean
[16:34.320 --> 16:41.000]  it's amazing I've been to communist China and the treatment is about 500% better than
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.960]  TSA and Homeland Security when I went to America got all my fingerprints taken don't need to
[16:46.960 --> 16:51.560]  get your fingerprints taken when you go to communist China so that just shows how unfree
[16:51.560 --> 16:57.760]  America is with all this security theater so basically you go through the baby cradle
[16:57.760 --> 17:03.240]  is broken you try to put your son in it he falls to the floor and you said he's not just
[17:03.240 --> 17:08.720]  his lip was bust open but is that his nose was actually broken is that the case well
[17:08.720 --> 17:13.240]  his nose was not exactly broken because that his age as the doctor has explained to us
[17:13.240 --> 17:17.120]  it's not really possible for your nose to be technically broken because the cartilage
[17:17.120 --> 17:22.520]  isn't fully formed but it was close to a broken nose as possible and his nose he was bleeding
[17:22.520 --> 17:29.520]  out of his nose the cartilage was busted the his lip was busted as well to the extent
[17:29.520 --> 17:39.280]  that even now many months later you can still see where his lip was busted at that time
[17:39.280 --> 17:45.480]  and I just want to say even outside of what actually happened and him falling which is
[17:45.480 --> 17:50.760]  horrific enough the biggest crime to me is the fact that the TSA did absolutely nothing
[17:50.760 --> 17:59.760]  so you know it's really my my feeling that the TSA would have even let my son God forbid
[17:59.760 --> 18:05.280]  die there if that was the case rather than rather than acts and so to me it was softly
[18:05.280 --> 18:10.840]  that I never thought that I would ever live to see especially in the United States of
[18:10.840 --> 18:11.840]  America.
[18:11.840 --> 18:15.640]  And so when when your son actually fell to the floor and started bleeding and crying
[18:15.640 --> 18:20.000]  what were the TSA agents doing were they just standing around and chatting or were they
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.400]  trying to work out what to do or did they just not care?
[18:23.400 --> 18:29.280]  They were looking at each other they looked at me several times and rolled their eyes
[18:29.280 --> 18:36.640]  and began talking to themselves again basically they didn't pay any attention to us whatsoever
[18:36.640 --> 18:39.920]  other than to sort of smirk at us.
[18:39.920 --> 18:44.080]  And then the police arrived didn't they and you tried to file charges tell us what happened
[18:44.080 --> 18:45.080]  with that.
[18:45.080 --> 18:50.720]  That's correct I did call 911 911 asked if we needed an ambulance or police I advised
[18:50.720 --> 18:58.520]  them both the ambulance came of course the primary concern was with my son while they
[18:58.520 --> 19:05.280]  were doing tests on him I went to with a police officer the officer asked me if I like to
[19:05.280 --> 19:11.120]  file a complaint against the TSA advised him that I would like to he asked me to come with
[19:11.120 --> 19:17.920]  him and to identify who the TSA personnel were which I did at that point he said that
[19:17.920 --> 19:25.960]  I should leave and he advised me that he was going to view the the video footage I said
[19:25.960 --> 19:32.080]  I'd like to see that as well and like to to be present because I would like to file charges
[19:32.080 --> 19:37.760]  against those two TSA employees and he very strongly cautioned me that I was instructed
[19:37.760 --> 19:43.320]  to vacate the immediate area and to find me going to go to a break now but we'll come
[19:43.320 --> 19:48.960]  back and finish the story with Kevin Ryan it's info wars dot com slash opt out this

[24:20.240 --> 24:26.120]  tomorrow we've got a rebroadcast of the last two hours coming up after my segment ends
[24:26.120 --> 24:30.440]  just after the top of the hour we're talking to Kevin Ryan who is a father who went through
[24:30.440 --> 24:38.400]  TSA security at Newark Liberty Airport his son was with him and his wife his baby son
[24:38.400 --> 24:43.440]  went through the security the TSA agents actually broke the baby cradle as they put it through
[24:43.440 --> 24:50.480]  the x-ray scanner he put his son in the cradle his son fell out lay there on the floor bleeding
[24:50.480 --> 24:57.840]  crying the TSA agents did absolutely nothing and then later Kevin was basically kicked
[24:57.840 --> 25:03.080]  out of the airport when he tried to make a fuss out of it Kevin in the email you sent
[25:03.080 --> 25:08.720]  me you talked about this feeling of entering into a post-apocalyptic world when you arrived
[25:08.720 --> 25:13.800]  there in the United States can you explain that to me yeah I mean unfortunately there's
[25:13.800 --> 25:21.600]  no really other way to put it it was something I just could not conceive what was possible
[25:21.600 --> 25:28.120]  certainly in the country that I call home and having been traveling and then returning
[25:28.120 --> 25:33.600]  it was almost as if you know as I said earlier I had flown back not to the actual United
[25:33.600 --> 25:44.280]  States but to a type of twilight zone USA so it was very very hard to believe that this
[25:44.280 --> 25:52.280]  was actually possible you know really it was it was experiencing what people are like if
[25:52.280 --> 25:59.200]  they don't have don't have souls but I really think that that's unfortunately a fair way
[25:59.200 --> 26:05.920]  to to describe the way the people the TSA acted you know I can't you know imagine that
[26:05.920 --> 26:11.360]  they could have that much hostility towards a baby you know I didn't mention when we went
[26:11.360 --> 26:17.400]  through the x-ray when I went with my son he had a baby blanket underneath of him and
[26:17.400 --> 26:23.080]  one of the TSA employees came and yanked the blanket out from underneath of him of course
[26:23.080 --> 26:27.360]  he was crying at that point and they said you know you can't go through with with the blanket
[26:27.360 --> 26:36.480]  and you know also in a hostile tone so that they just seem to have no no respect for citizens
[26:36.480 --> 26:41.360]  and certainly no respects for baby I mean it's a sad statement when even even our babies
[26:41.360 --> 26:47.600]  aren't safe you know there's there's many an evil person who still has some some level
[26:47.600 --> 26:55.600]  of of sympathy for for children but apparently that's not the case with all of the employees
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.320]  I mean it's amazing isn't it they must be being trained to be rude and hostile to people
[27:00.320 --> 27:05.920]  as an intimidation tactic because I mean there's so many stories now they come out on an almost
[27:05.920 --> 27:12.040]  daily basis and just the rudeness even when I go on Twitter and search for TSA stories
[27:12.040 --> 27:16.640]  it's just one after another I went through such and such an airport security five minutes
[27:16.640 --> 27:21.360]  ago I've never experienced rude or airport security the fact is it's losing the United
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.520]  States billions and billions of dollars of tourism money because people are just refusing
[27:26.520 --> 27:31.400]  to visit there now have you considered filing a lawsuit how where are you going to take
[27:31.400 --> 27:40.400]  this from here sir filing a lawsuit mainly as a matter of principle and you know I've
[27:40.400 --> 27:45.640]  told a number of attorneys that I've spoke with that you know in order to make this more
[27:45.640 --> 27:49.840]  appealing for them we you know we're not taking we don't need to be on the financial
[27:49.840 --> 27:53.560]  receiving end of any type of settlements we just think this case out there we just like
[27:53.560 --> 28:00.400]  to get reform within the TSA anything else they can take we just want to know we just
[28:00.400 --> 28:05.960]  want to stop this ever happening to other people and sorry to these other babies and
[28:05.960 --> 28:10.960]  I really believe it was a situation where where somebody in a similar situation could
[28:10.960 --> 28:16.200]  have could have been more seriously injured or even died so new fields my responsibility
[28:16.200 --> 28:21.960]  to to make this known and to do something is what I appreciate you having on the show
[28:21.960 --> 28:28.120]  the lawyers that I spoke with were surprising quite surprisingly to me not terribly interested
[28:28.120 --> 28:32.400]  in the case and I said this is really a perfect thing to happen to you but the TSA is a very
[28:32.400 --> 28:37.920]  powerful engine to go up against and you know it's not something that our law firm would
[28:37.920 --> 28:41.880]  be would be interested in pursuing so they really felt like they didn't have a chance
[28:41.880 --> 28:49.360]  to win the to win the case and just also would mention that I also contacted the TSA and gave
[28:49.360 --> 28:55.000]  them an opportunity to address the matter internally and they didn't send me a letter
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.120]  and reply several months later and said they had reviewed the footage which the police
[28:59.120 --> 29:06.440]  have seen and the TSA has seen but as a citizen or not allowed to see and said that they saw
[29:06.440 --> 29:11.920]  what I was referring to but the actions of the TSA were in keeping with their official
[29:11.920 --> 29:18.720]  policy which I take as a moment of what as a as acceptance of what happened as being
[29:18.720 --> 29:24.320]  part of the standard protocol for the TSA well it's a shocking story and we'll be sure
[29:24.320 --> 29:29.920]  to have the article up about it on info wars dot com tomorrow keep us up to date Kevin

[33:22.480 --> 33:26.820]  be back tomorrow rest assured don't worry and we're talking to Dan Dick suppress the
[33:26.820 --> 33:34.240]  truth TV and Ashley Jessica organizer of course of the TSA opt out and film week campaign
[33:34.240 --> 33:39.760]  which is at info wars.com slash opt out and yesterday you probably heard them briefly
[33:39.760 --> 33:46.600]  on the show Dan and Ashley travel to Buffalo airport to take part in the campaign to hand
[33:46.600 --> 33:52.320]  out flyers to do some filming but before they even got there they were basically detained
[33:52.320 --> 33:56.320]  at the border and we're going to hear all about it as well as what happened in the airport
[33:56.320 --> 34:02.640]  which is a separate story within itself. So Dan and Ashley welcome to the show.
[34:02.640 --> 34:09.000]  Thanks for having us Paul. So as I just mentioned I mean you told me in an email I don't know
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.440]  any of the details but you were detained at the border before you even got to the airport
[34:14.440 --> 34:20.600]  tell us what happened. So basically when we were driving through they asked of course
[34:20.600 --> 34:24.440]  what our purpose was for entering the United States we told them a little bit that we were
[34:24.440 --> 34:30.320]  just going to document a nationwide campaign that's going on at the Buffalo airport. When
[34:30.320 --> 34:36.560]  the border officer asked he asked what I do I said I'm a PhD student and he asked Dan
[34:36.560 --> 34:43.880]  what he does. He said I'm a journalist and he said figures and then he started typing
[34:43.880 --> 34:48.840]  something in his computer gave us a slip told us to go to secondary screening pretty much
[34:48.840 --> 34:54.600]  as soon as we told him what the campaign was all about TSA. The words TSA came out he leans
[34:54.600 --> 34:58.440]  into the car and looks at me and says what do you do and I said well I'm a journalist
[34:58.440 --> 35:05.640]  and a filmmaker and he goes figures pull on over to secondary. So immediately we were
[35:05.640 --> 35:11.760]  taken into the secondary screening area for over an hour they held us there before anybody
[35:11.760 --> 35:17.320]  talked to us and the funny thing is when we were in there you know Ashley's the one you
[35:17.320 --> 35:22.360]  kind of launched the campaign it's her car and you know we're sitting there me and her
[35:22.360 --> 35:28.160]  and my friend and when it came time for us to talk to customs they just said Dan come
[35:28.160 --> 35:34.400]  here please and all three of us get up and they say no no just you and he had a few more
[35:34.400 --> 35:40.120]  questions for me and basically asked me you know questioned me for maybe five or ten minutes
[35:40.120 --> 35:44.880]  and then pretty much let us let us on their way didn't have any questions for them.
[35:44.880 --> 35:48.320]  No he asked Dan if I was the spokesperson for the campaign.
[35:48.320 --> 35:52.280]  Yeah we told him what the campaign was he I guess he did a quick Google search or something
[35:52.280 --> 35:57.440]  I see him there typing it in and he looked it up he said let me go talk to my superiors
[35:57.440 --> 36:02.880]  here and then he came back he said she's not the spokesperson or anything I'm like no
[36:02.880 --> 36:09.160]  I don't know and he said okay go go go ahead. So slight little snag there at the border
[36:09.160 --> 36:16.560]  um it was kind of half expected but yeah and um one thing I did go ahead one thing I did
[36:16.560 --> 36:21.760]  notice in the secondary screening area there is a big picture of Janet Napolitano's face
[36:21.760 --> 36:30.160]  which is framed on the wall there. Alla 1984. Yeah so that was pretty eerie creepy so um
[36:30.160 --> 36:34.960]  basically you were treated as suspicious simply because you were a journalist Dan what kind
[36:34.960 --> 36:40.520]  of questions did they ask you? Basically what's the whole point of this thing what's your
[36:40.520 --> 36:47.520]  purpose um you know what's this for uh where's this gonna show up basically and I just you
[36:47.520 --> 36:50.760]  know told him straight out you know because we we have nothing to hide we're not doing
[36:50.760 --> 36:56.120]  anything illegal there's no reason to lie to them anyway at all so I said we're going
[36:56.120 --> 37:00.680]  down there to document this campaign it's gained national attention it's being on CBS
[37:00.680 --> 37:05.720]  and Huffington Post and all over the news it's a big national campaign and I'm a journalist
[37:05.720 --> 37:10.920]  so we're interested in this topic and we want to go down there to interview some people
[37:10.920 --> 37:16.400]  to get some footage of this campaign and to just document the the event and he asked me
[37:16.400 --> 37:22.640]  where's this kind of stuff going to be showing up and I I just said YouTube and um that was
[37:22.640 --> 37:27.920]  pretty much it and he had to go and confer just double check with his superiors before
[37:27.920 --> 37:32.800]  he let us go um but that was pretty much the line of questioning what's the point of this
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.600]  what are you doing and where's this going to end up um so I just answered his questions
[37:37.600 --> 37:41.640]  and I guess they had nothing nothing else on us because like I said we're not doing anything
[37:41.640 --> 37:46.880]  illegal it's perfectly within our rights and um so they they had to just let us uh go on
[37:46.880 --> 37:52.120]  in and so it was a slight slight snag there um they held us up just for a little over
[37:52.120 --> 37:57.520]  an hour yeah a little stressful well I mean you were probably expecting harassment but
[37:57.520 --> 38:03.560]  you were probably expecting it at the airport not at the border I guess I was kind of half
[38:03.560 --> 38:09.240]  expecting it at the border we were we were prepared for it um I'm glad that it wasn't
[38:09.240 --> 38:14.200]  worse than it was there just see the attitude of the attitude of the guy just the way he
[38:14.200 --> 38:21.200]  looks at me and he goes yeah figures pull over mm-hmm that's amazing the cars ripped
[38:21.200 --> 38:27.640]  apart I didn't know what we were at what we were in for with based on his attitude so
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.440]  so I mean finally you get out of there after being delayed for so long now to be clear
[38:32.440 --> 38:36.640]  I don't even know what happened at the airport yeah I'm as interested as all the listeners
[38:36.640 --> 38:43.440]  to find out so you get to Buffalo um take the story from there probably within the first
[38:43.440 --> 38:49.680]  minute of finding the TSA checkpoints and and within the first minute of us pulling
[38:49.680 --> 38:55.480]  out our cameras we are surrounded by TSA agents at first who were just kind of checking us
[38:55.480 --> 39:01.840]  out and they're all on their phones and radios and then within another minute or so um we
[39:01.840 --> 39:08.480]  were surrounded by these other another agency guys in white white suits with their badges
[39:08.480 --> 39:15.280]  and stuff and I guess they're the transit um transit police yeah airport transit security
[39:15.280 --> 39:22.520]  um I am a transit police and FTA transit police I call them 4.5s you know not quite
[39:22.520 --> 39:30.840]  a 5-0 so they uh they surrounded us right away and they think they knew you were coming
[39:30.840 --> 39:37.440]  no no they uh they did well as far as I know they didn't um it seemed they they they were
[39:37.440 --> 39:41.040]  you know wondering what what we're doing and it was the first they heard of this they were
[39:41.040 --> 39:48.520]  curious to see the flyers they were alerted by the TSA out the out the airport um so yeah
[39:48.520 --> 39:53.280]  they they surrounded us at first and and immediately uh said don't you can't you can't be filming
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.600]  over there and we right away asserted our rights and said actually we can we even double
[39:57.600 --> 40:02.840]  checked on the website we are allowed to film yeah the TSA we can film this the the area
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.320]  as long as we're not pointing the cameras at the monitors and they had to they said well
[40:07.320 --> 40:12.400]  can you just stop until we double check to confirm that that's true they didn't even
[40:12.400 --> 40:16.760]  know their own laws it seems like they were very uninformed with the laws one of them
[40:16.760 --> 40:24.560]  even slapped um Dan's camera shot very aggressively true he smacked my um the lcd lens the the
[40:24.560 --> 40:29.400]  screen there closed and I opened it again he smacks it shut again and I said you cannot
[40:29.400 --> 40:35.760]  touch my equipment in fact one of his superiors later came up to me and basically apologized
[40:35.760 --> 40:39.760]  for that incident and said you know we're going to speak to him about that he he had
[40:39.760 --> 40:45.320]  no right to touch your camera gear of all the guys that were there I have to say one
[40:45.320 --> 40:50.720]  guy in particular was very very calm very collected very cool exactly how it should
[40:50.720 --> 40:56.320]  go and we'll certainly be able to show that once once we get this video put together yeah
[40:56.320 --> 41:01.520]  he was very interested in hearing more about the campaign he's very open minded so that
[41:01.520 --> 41:06.720]  was really refreshing to see you know so what what strikes me though before we get into
[41:06.720 --> 41:12.480]  more of what happened is how dumb they are if they just leave you alone let you film
[41:12.480 --> 41:18.120]  the checkpoint for a while hand out some flyers you know for an hour or two then no incident
[41:18.120 --> 41:22.920]  happens and the the footage that you get is quite banal and not very interesting but it's
[41:22.920 --> 41:27.400]  the very fact that they have to intervene and they have to cause an incident that gives
[41:27.400 --> 41:31.680]  you the footage and turns it into a story so I mean does that strike you as dumb or
[41:31.680 --> 41:35.720]  are they just you know trained to do that and they fear they'd lose their jobs if they
[41:35.720 --> 41:47.080]  didn't it's it's it's quite odd quite ridiculous really so and as you said they they approach
[41:47.080 --> 41:53.160]  us and end up engaging in conversation with us and I have some very interesting conversations
[41:53.160 --> 41:56.960]  with those guys we haven't even checked our own footage yet but I can't I can't wait to
[41:56.960 --> 42:02.160]  go over it all and because it's a lot to remember we were talking to those guys for hours and
[42:02.160 --> 42:07.280]  they disclosed a lot of information a lot of stuff that I was surprised they were being
[42:07.280 --> 42:11.920]  so candid with and telling us about one of the guys was saying he says you know their
[42:11.920 --> 42:16.120]  whole screening process isn't very good he said their their training isn't very good
[42:16.120 --> 42:20.680]  it only takes two weeks anybody can get in and do this kind of thing they were very candid
[42:20.680 --> 42:25.160]  in speaking with us the one guy anyways yeah you know he was saying that they're not exactly
[42:25.160 --> 42:32.720]  particularly fond of the TSA either that's true yeah the very own security airport security
[42:32.720 --> 42:37.120]  there was saying you know what guys the one guy actually was saying you know what what
[42:37.120 --> 42:41.680]  you're saying makes sense to me I mean he's like I'm kind of starting to wonder about
[42:41.680 --> 42:46.960]  it all now because everything you've been telling me makes sense so I'm gonna I'm gonna start
[42:46.960 --> 42:51.880]  to look into this a little bit which of course is the whole goal of the campaign yeah raise
[42:51.880 --> 42:56.320]  awareness about this stuff get the word out raising awareness was an issue though they
[42:56.320 --> 43:00.680]  didn't let us hand out flyers right so they said that we could be arrested for soliciting
[43:00.680 --> 43:07.880]  they they were sort of going back and forth about that they weren't sure exactly you're
[43:07.880 --> 43:13.000]  supposed to be soliciting you're just giving out information exactly that's what we said
[43:13.000 --> 43:20.320]  but they just said look you're you're you're soliciting and you just you can't you can't
[43:20.320 --> 43:26.600]  handle the flyers so you know it was all about just talking to the people in line and let
[43:26.600 --> 43:30.920]  us know they have the option to opt out so we said you know what let's not let this deter
[43:30.920 --> 43:35.520]  us we're still going to talk to these people all of these passengers who are about to be
[43:35.520 --> 43:39.880]  faced with this choice of going through this very dangerous machine or getting the pat
[43:39.880 --> 43:45.320]  down we're still gonna talk to them and inform them even though you know we can't give you
[43:45.320 --> 43:49.440]  the piece of paper so I just held it up and told them you know went through point by point
[43:49.440 --> 43:53.840]  what the campaign is about and a lot of the travelers were so open minded a lot of them
[43:53.840 --> 43:58.040]  didn't know about the health risks associated with the body scanners some of them didn't
[43:58.040 --> 44:03.680]  even know that they could be sexually assaulted by the TSA during a pat down procedure so
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.920]  many of the travelers they had the right to opt out because I found that a lot we sent
[44:08.920 --> 44:13.080]  reporters down to Austin Bergstrom and half the travelers didn't even know they had the
[44:13.080 --> 44:18.080]  right to opt out did you find that or were they informed about it I found it somewhere
[44:18.080 --> 44:23.440]  informed and somewhere and it was kind of a mix I would say a lot of them didn't know
[44:23.440 --> 44:29.000]  that they had the right to film so that was something that they were unaware of for sure
[44:29.000 --> 44:34.200]  yeah yeah most of them had no idea that you are actually allowed to film your pat downs
[44:34.200 --> 44:39.240]  and you know it's for your own safety and your own protection you might need it who knows
[44:39.240 --> 44:44.560]  in the future as some evidence or something so it's fully within your right to document
[44:44.560 --> 44:50.200]  when they are giving you this intrusive and invasive pat down most people had no idea
[44:50.200 --> 44:56.800]  about that they were surprised they said oh I didn't know that so that was good everyone
[44:56.800 --> 45:03.400]  was very receptive to the to the information though very much so yes so that left you alone
[45:03.400 --> 45:08.280]  for a while did they and allowed you to film and take the story from there they did but
[45:08.280 --> 45:15.480]  then at the end the chief of the NFTA transit police came up to us and said he doesn't know
[45:15.480 --> 45:20.040]  what the TSA policy on filming is we tried to educate him on it over and over again and
[45:20.040 --> 45:24.720]  he said that you know he doesn't know about it and in his opinion we're not allowed to
[45:24.720 --> 45:32.560]  film so he's saying we can't film the TSA checkpoint and I said well in fact we can I even double
[45:32.560 --> 45:38.000]  check the website before I came here and he says well so you say yeah and then and the
[45:38.000 --> 45:43.400]  one guy was saying can you just not point it that way the camera towards the checkpoint
[45:43.400 --> 45:49.880]  and I said you know I'm sorry I that's the whole point of coming here was to film the
[45:49.880 --> 45:55.680]  TSA so I'm sorry but no I'm not going to point the camera the other way yet nothing
[45:55.680 --> 46:01.440]  right a wall you know they didn't you like you said Paul the funny thing is they didn't
[46:01.440 --> 46:06.920]  even know their own rights they had to double check I got I got asked for ID that for example
[46:06.920 --> 46:11.360]  yes that's another thing they kept asking us over and over again for our names and when
[46:11.360 --> 46:16.520]  I told them I do not have to present my ID to you the one officer there was a little
[46:16.520 --> 46:21.560]  taken aback and was of course you do kind of a look on her face and said you know what
[46:21.560 --> 46:27.200]  do you mean and I said well do you suspect us of committing some sort of a crime you
[46:27.200 --> 46:31.200]  know we haven't done anything wrong we're not doing anything illegal we don't have to
[46:31.200 --> 46:35.680]  present our papers here I actually America land of the free you don't have to present
[46:35.680 --> 46:40.600]  your papers on demand oh there reminds me I had I had a conversation with the chief
[46:40.600 --> 46:44.320]  of police there and I said you know it's places like Germany where you have to present your
[46:44.320 --> 46:54.240]  papers upon request and he said good that's how it should be oh really yeah yeah exactly
[46:54.240 --> 47:04.520]  the chief of their boss Germany great well I'm sure he's been trained well so the police
[47:04.520 --> 47:08.000]  basically threatened to if you don't stop them we're going to arrest you is that what
[47:08.000 --> 47:16.560]  happened pretty much well just with the soliciting as they called it and again the one lady admitted
[47:16.560 --> 47:23.400]  I'm not even positive if this is considered soliciting or not but at that point you know
[47:23.400 --> 47:28.440]  we said you know what let's just let's just continue to do what we came here to do we'll
[47:28.440 --> 47:34.040]  inform the people of their options we'll film the TSA and not let that little snag slip
[47:34.040 --> 47:39.040]  us up there but we're really looking forward to putting this video together really interesting
[47:39.040 --> 47:44.720]  conversations topic of 9-11 came up a bunch of times the one guy mainly was saying well
[47:44.720 --> 47:50.200]  9-11 right I mean look what happened there obviously we need to you know these these
[47:50.200 --> 47:56.200]  are all necessary procedures and nothing has happened since 9-11 and I said well sir maybe
[47:56.200 --> 48:01.720]  that's because there's no real threat to begin with in the first place and he's he just kind
[48:01.720 --> 48:09.480]  of stared at me for a second said I you will have to agree to disagree on that but the topic
[48:09.480 --> 48:15.400]  of 9-11 came up a number of times suggesting this is why we're we're doing this and I tried
[48:15.400 --> 48:21.400]  to explain to them guys this is a very very slippery slope incremental push towards a very
[48:21.400 --> 48:26.100]  tyrannical police state I mean there there's nations that have just awoken to this police
[48:26.100 --> 48:30.720]  state and they don't realize how they got there so unless we address these things as
[48:30.720 --> 48:36.160]  they arise in these small incremental steps we too could very soon wake up in this police
[48:36.160 --> 48:40.560]  state going what on earth has happened what is going on here I tried to explain that to
[48:40.560 --> 48:46.240]  them luckily obviously the cameras were rolling the whole time so we can't wait to show you
[48:46.240 --> 48:50.200]  guys some of the interesting conversations we had with these guys yeah we got so much
[48:50.200 --> 48:56.200]  on film well I can't wait to see it I mean yeah on the topic of 9-11 I mean the TSA
[48:56.200 --> 49:03.560]  was created shortly after 9-11 of course 16,500 employees that's now up to 60,000 and they
[49:03.560 --> 49:08.440]  failed to catch a single terrorist but they are quite good at letting weapons through
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.160]  you know stealing iPad stealing people's money smacking people in the testicles they refuse
[49:13.160 --> 49:18.080]  to go through a body scan I've actually received emails over the past two days from several
[49:18.080 --> 49:24.440]  different people saying that the TSA at different airports is forcing people to go through the
[49:24.440 --> 49:29.920]  body scanner even if they opt out even if they say I want to exercise my right to opt
[49:29.920 --> 49:35.240]  out the TSA is forcing people to go through it and even a cancer victim who was in tears
[49:35.240 --> 49:39.240]  they forced her to go through the scanner so I'm wondering if that's a general thing
[49:39.240 --> 49:44.080]  or if it's in response to this week's opt out protest and we're going to continue to
[49:44.080 --> 49:50.800]  talk to Dan Dix and Ashley Jessica Dan Dix of course Press for Truth dot TV Ashley Jessica
[49:50.800 --> 49:55.840]  who's helped us organize this campaign it was her idea to begin with we're going to
[49:55.840 --> 50:03.600]  go to more news stories about the TSA that actually came out publicly and issued a warning
[50:03.600 --> 50:10.400]  that people could be arrested by the police if they take part in the TSA opt out and film
[50:10.400 --> 50:15.760]  week campaign that stories up on info wars dot com and basically they admitted that their
[50:15.760 --> 50:22.800]  own policy says people are allowed to film at checkpoints in airports but local ordinances
[50:22.800 --> 50:27.880]  and laws could mean that people would get harassed by the police of course the first
[50:27.880 --> 50:34.480]  court of appeals has ruled repeatedly that filming police in the United States is not
[50:34.480 --> 50:39.040]  illegal apparently some TSA officers as Dan and Ashley just described think that they're
[50:39.040 --> 50:44.720]  above the law even though they're not technically officers because they have to go through absolutely
[50:44.720 --> 50:49.800]  zero police training whatsoever but they still get to wear the shiny badge and feel powerful
[50:49.800 --> 50:53.400]  while they're while they're groping children so we're going to go to Dan and Ashley more
[50:53.400 --> 51:00.960]  after the break on info wars dot com Alex Jones show stay tuned we'll be back have you ever

[54:09.600 --> 54:17.560]  well i think i see another side maybe more breaking news on the tsa as we return on the
[54:17.560 --> 54:23.640]  alex jones show i'm paul joe the fox and in for alex jones tsa reportedly exposed breasts
[54:23.640 --> 54:31.120]  of ralph hall's teen grand niece called it accidental and this is a republican congressman
[54:31.120 --> 54:38.760]  from texas his grand niece a seventeen year old girl went through security at lax airport
[54:38.760 --> 54:45.520]  and the tsa agent in the course of the pat now expose her breasts in public this is a
[54:45.520 --> 54:53.840]  big breaking story just amazing i say every day the tsa gets caught out in a new scandal
[54:53.840 --> 55:00.040]  i mean sometimes it's multiple times daily i've never known another organization or branch
[55:00.040 --> 55:07.320]  of government agency that can get so much bad bad publicity and yet still remain not
[55:07.320 --> 55:13.000]  only in one piece but growing thousands upon thousands of new agents each year thousands
[55:13.000 --> 55:18.440]  upon thousands of new unannounced checkpoints each year not only in airports that's key
[55:18.440 --> 55:24.840]  to emphasize but also highways of course political events music concerts prom nights you name
[55:24.840 --> 55:31.280]  it the tsa is expanding and that's why we're standing up against it during opt out and
[55:31.280 --> 55:37.440]  film week here so dan and ashley any other points about what you experienced i mean were
[55:37.440 --> 55:42.520]  you able to film some of the pat downs did you notice the tsa being any less invasive
[55:42.520 --> 55:48.680]  because you were filming them that's quite possible we were filming some of that some
[55:48.680 --> 55:53.160]  of them walking through the machine some of the pat downs and we made that point to some
[55:53.160 --> 55:57.160]  of the passengers walking in it's the fact that you know when you have those cameras
[55:57.160 --> 56:04.800]  rolling it protects you it acts as a layer of protection they may think twice about doing
[56:04.800 --> 56:08.760]  some of the things that they would normally do when they're under the eyes of the camera
[56:08.760 --> 56:13.920]  and so we pointed that out to the people walking in there as well and as far as like you said
[56:13.920 --> 56:18.840]  that the they're just expanding big time that all comes back to the fact that they're not
[56:18.840 --> 56:24.200]  really doing any serious training or real background checks they're just bringing on
[56:24.200 --> 56:32.240]  anyone and everyone exactly yeah so so what advice would you give to other people who
[56:32.240 --> 56:38.280]  are thinking about taking part in this opt out and film campaign this week just know
[56:38.280 --> 56:46.360]  your rights assert your rights when when the tsa or airport police try to intimidate you
[56:46.360 --> 56:52.360]  and stand your ground absolutely because these guys don't even know their own laws
[56:52.360 --> 57:01.800]  have a good idea that we would suggest people do is maybe look up on the tsa's website
[57:01.800 --> 57:06.520]  and find the page where it talks about the fact that you are allowed to film the tsa
[57:06.520 --> 57:10.720]  and the checkpoints and print that out because no doubt they're going to challenge you on
[57:10.720 --> 57:14.440]  that they're going to say you know what I'm not sure about that let me check into that
[57:14.440 --> 57:17.720]  and at that point you can just pull it right out of your pocket and say here I'll save
[57:17.720 --> 57:22.520]  you the time here it is right here I'm allowed to do this so that's something people can
[57:22.520 --> 57:27.520]  do you know print print that sheet out have it on you in your pocket while you're there
[57:27.520 --> 57:33.240]  and bring plenty of battery power plenty of tapes whatever you need you don't know how
[57:33.240 --> 57:40.040]  long it's going to take and and just as we said stand your grounds know your rights because
[57:40.040 --> 57:44.720]  these guys don't and just assert your rights to them let them know look I don't have to
[57:44.720 --> 57:49.200]  give you my ID I can't continue to film I'm not going to point the camera this way you
[57:49.200 --> 57:54.360]  know we're we're here to take part in this campaign you can't stop us basically and I
[57:54.360 --> 57:59.120]  guess if you could find some public property it might be worth also handing out the flyers
[57:59.120 --> 58:05.560]  outside the airport I think that's a great idea to avoid the harassment and being threatened
[58:05.560 --> 58:10.440]  with arrest for soliciting I think that's the best idea handed out to travelers walking
[58:10.440 --> 58:16.280]  inside let's just let them know spread the I think the most important thing is to just
[58:16.280 --> 58:21.280]  alert as many people as possible about the campaign about their right to opt out and
[58:21.280 --> 58:27.000]  their right to film and why it's so important to do both the thing that gets me about it
[58:27.000 --> 58:36.120]  is you know I go on Twitter and search TSA TSA opt out most of it is people laughing and
[58:36.120 --> 58:45.040]  joking there's actually one I saw today about a woman who laughs this is GCN the Genesis
[58:45.040 --> 58:55.120]  communications radio network strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically
[58:55.120 --> 59:00.280]  in the future about how do I safeguard renowned author and expert Joel Scowzen the U.S. isn't
[59:00.280 --> 59:04.560]  building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat they know
[59:04.560 --> 59:09.520]  that a massive nuclear attack is coming they want that attack to come Joel Scowzen is
[59:09.520 --> 59:14.520]  renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of
[59:14.520 --> 59:19.920]  your home what I tell people is that you do have time we talk about natural disasters
[59:19.920 --> 59:24.360]  the health environment we talk about pollution the water quality my personal experience about
[59:24.360 --> 59:28.240]  being in every one of these states most people wanting to be ready won't be able to get out
[59:28.240 --> 59:33.480]  of town because there'll be absolute panic there is no preparedness without strategy
[59:33.480 --> 59:39.840]  this Christmas give the gift of preparedness strategic relocation the film with Joel Scowzen

[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.400]  we're going to do rebroadcast starting in about five or six minutes time breaking news
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:41.800]  info wars.com TSA tacit threat to opt out journalist we know who you are the TSA is
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.600]  publicly slammed a journalist who opted out of an x-ray body scan and then reported that
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.840]  genitals were grown by an agent who refused to provide her name and even wore her TSA
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:01:00.320]  badge upside down to avoid being identified so the TSA is now publicly naming journalists
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.760]  who opt out of the body scanner and who write stories about it just as they put the CNN
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:12.880]  journalist on a list when he wrote critical news stories about the federal agency they
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.280]  actually target people who criticize them it's occurred on a number of different occasions
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.640]  we've got their internal memos attesting to that still waiting the internal memos on the
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:28.960]  fact that during the last national opt out day campaign the TSA mentioned the drudge
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:36.000]  report Alex Jones and info wars.com in their internal memos nine pages they refused to release
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.800]  them under the freedom of information act request they're still holding on to them we
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.360]  still don't know what's contained in those memos we're talking with Dan Dix and Ashley
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:51.520]  Jessica who were involved in the campaign yesterday there at Buffalo airport Dan and

[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:50.120]  the campaign information is at info wars.com slash opt out it's about opting out of the
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:57.080]  ridiculous TSA obedience training measures not just the body scanner but also the chat
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:02.560]  downs the drink tests and everything about it and also using your first amendment rights
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:09.760]  to film the TSA which is perfectly legal it says so on the TSA's own website no matter
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:16.360]  the fact that as you heard in the last segment the TSA doesn't actually know its own policies
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:21.200]  it is on their website you're allowed to film so we encourage people to do that and it's
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:27.240]  all at info wars.com slash opt out and of course throughout the week I'm going to be
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:33.760]  writing numerous articles about this campaign about the latest scandals involving the TSA

[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:01.400]  not slaves this is all unconstitutional north com india a government health care written
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:06.320]  by foreign bank owned insurance companies we're not going along with us and ron paul and his
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:10.960]  incredible speech we're gonna play some excerpts coming up 49 minutes it's up at info wars
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:17.040]  dot com he said we're under fascism it's premeditated it is psychopathic organized evil these are
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:23.240]  quotes by the way he said they are that is world government they have announced all over
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:29.040]  the news we played the clips at nauseam where they say we've been conquered by foreign banks
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:35.880]  and laugh at us on cnbc bloomberg tv financial times of london this is a legal declaration
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:41.840]  just as europe's been conquered by being signed on to banker derivatives we are now here we
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:47.120]  are being conquered and i say as we go to the lawyer to a constitutional lawyer to get
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:50.800]  his one of the chief experts to get his take on this plan and i don't know his take on
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.240]  this yet i mean i do know what it's going to be because i've read his books research
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.400]  what he's saying but we have to get out front and not let hundreds of newspapers tv say
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:05.800]  it's racist to talk about seceding and that people are mad because obama's black no we're
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.880]  mad because he's announcing cyber security takeover executive order because they're
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.920]  announcing we're under socialism because the country's going to hell in a handbasket we
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.720]  have to point out the blue states are all going bankrupt not the republicans are much
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.120]  better but people at least voted for the lesser of two evils there they understand the road
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:28.560]  to perdition we're on we must go to the legislatures and i want mr viras take on this right now
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:36.600]  we must go to the legislatures now and say with with versions of a new declaration of
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:43.640]  independence with the same facts in the original from 1776 you lie forth and say we need to
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.960]  have groups organized through the governor's council not the fake femo one but the real
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:53.720]  governor's council the legislative councils led by people like dr vira like ron paul like
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:12:00.320]  lou rockwell uh like countless other patriots out there that it's now time to say we are
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:07.600]  succeeding to restore the republic but to also reconstitute the federal government which
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:14.000]  is fascistic is tyrannical is spying on us illegally and is producing a total tyranny
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.920]  of domination because they know the people are waking up it is now time to admit how
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:23.560]  bad it is and move at the states and explain the country's been conquered by globalist
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.760]  as ron paul said in the speech let's just tell it like it is they brag reconstitute the
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.640]  republic secession for survival secession to restore the republic secession because we've
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:38.840]  been conquered by foreign banks and get that word out get different petitions circulating
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.520]  get different versions of a new declaration of independence then have a large meeting
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.360]  of governors legislators that want to come organized by ron paul campaign for liberty
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:55.280]  because he's respected and because we trust him to have that meeting and then to go forth
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.440]  building that idea this went on for a decade before 1776 we've got to do this before they
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:04.800]  come for the guns they're planning a civil war they're now billing it that obama's link
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:10.000]  in two uh the states are racist uh they've got petitions at the white house i've got
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.880]  it right here i'll show you a document cam shot of your viewer to arrest people citing
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:19.400]  the petitions to organize federal militias to occupy the states to implement all these
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:23.720]  plans folks this is going to really get bad they're now going to try to totally take over
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:28.560]  america they've said they're going to try to say all semi-autos have to be handed in
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:34.440]  now again now his website i will give that to you in a moment edwin viera jr holds four
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:38.680]  degrees from harvard ab harvard college am with phd harvard graduate school of arts and
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:43.120]  sciences and jd harvard law school more than 30 years he's practiced law with emphasis on
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.760]  constitutional issues in the supreme court of the united states he successfully argued
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:51.400]  or briefed the case leading to the landmark decision uh bud versus detroit board of education
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:56.280]  chicago teachers i'm not going to go over all his landmark cases but i mean he is a chief
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:01.320]  amongst constitutional lawyers i've done my excited introduction sir but the crest
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:09.220]  of the wave from julia caesar uh the uh the play written by uh well the greatest play
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:14.000]  ride of all time william shakespeare his version of julia caesar there is a tide in
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.520]  the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune our fortune is liberty
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.800]  and freedom that's the treasure we seek can you not intellectually but also in your guts
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:29.920]  sir feel the great wave that is now cresting and we've got to surf that thing into victory
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.360]  now is the time to go on the offense what do you think of my statement of redeclaration
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:42.320]  of independence a re upload of the original republic uh and kicking out and and and and
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:48.960]  trashing this new world order takeover sir well i think uh that's the key element this
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:56.280]  is not really a revolutionary activity that we're talking about it's a restoration a restoration
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.280]  of the principle of the declaration and then a restoration of the constitutional principles
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:05.560]  which are founded on the principle of the declaration of independence so i've become
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:11.800]  uh a little bit leery of the word and bantered around uh too freely because i don't think
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:17.440]  the goal ultimately is for particular states to remove themselves from the union in the
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:25.520]  sense of becoming independent republics independent sovereignty but to assert state authority
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:31.440]  which is really at the basis of the entire federal system so as to restore the principles
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:39.200]  of the constitution in washington dc to the extent that that can be done in the long term
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:47.360]  and in the short term to return as much economic and political power to the states and the
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.560]  people as is possible so i've always said this is a matter of fundamentally of what
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.520]  i would call interposition number one the state's stepping forward and telling those
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:01.880]  people in washington that there are certain lines that cannot be crossed constitutionally
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:06.480]  and if they are the states will assert the powers that they have under the constitution
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:13.200]  uh to interpose themselves in favor of their people against essentially a rogue attack
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.400]  that are coming out of uh the district columbia and then secondly the enactment of certain
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.000]  kinds of legislation that is completely constitutional completely within the authorities of the states
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.880]  to put into effect i would say number one is the restoration as i've said many times
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:32.280]  the restoration of the constitutional militia of the several states these are institutions
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:37.800]  that the constitution foresees are to be permanent they're at the same status as uh the constitutionality
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.280]  at least congress the president the court system even the states themselves they will put in
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:47.840]  there for a very specific purpose because the founding fathers understood as the second
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.120]  amendment tells us a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.320]  and this concept of a free state is the ultimate purpose of both the constitution and the
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:03.160]  declaration so that in a sense is for motor companies to say is job one we have to restore
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:08.680]  those institutions to their constitutional position within each of the states and when
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:14.280]  we do that those institutions become a foundation for taking many actions that are necessary
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:19.320]  to give the states the kind of political uh and economic i won't say autonomy necessarily
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:25.560]  but certainly clout you can't have a really independent state political and economic
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:31.560]  policy while the state and its people are tied to the federal reserve system it's impossible
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:36.840]  you have to have an alternative monetary system and we're going to need that in any event because
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.480]  the federal reserve system is coming down one way or the other it's going to go into
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:44.640]  very serious crisis could be hyperinflationary could be a depression could be a combination
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:52.200]  of both but the end of that fiat money central banking paradigm if you will you can see it
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.920]  on the near horizon so that's step number one that could be done through a militia we need
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:02.440]  to take control of food security and energy security within each state that can be done
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.720]  through a state militia we need to assert all of the aspects of local homeland security
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:12.360]  fema has nothing to do with those things the department of homeland security has nothing
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:17.520]  to do with those things once the state militia is organized the state militia will have control
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:22.480]  of those mouths oh and by the way as the constitution points out the only officers of the state
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:28.640]  militia are of course appointed by the states which means that those civilian officials
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.880]  in the department of homeland security fema whatever have precisely no authority under
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:38.480]  those circumstances to essentially freeze them out of this process as well so the whole series
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:45.040]  of steps that can be taken but they have to be taken within the clear constitutional
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.680]  paradigm that's really our problem you know this is a situation where we've been driving
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.760]  the Mercedes down the road and now all of a sudden the engine starts chugging and it
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:19:01.080]  stops and we go out we lift up the hood and we look we don't know what to do why not because
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:06.160]  we haven't read the book of instructions which tells us go fill up the gas tank on a regular
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:11.200]  basis right look at the gas gauge look at the oil gauge whatever it is right we have a book
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:17.280]  of instructions the founding fathers gave us for living in a free state under a limited
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.920]  government in which the first purpose is that the preamble says securing the blessings of
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.160]  liberty to ourselves and our prosperity Dr. Evan Vieira constitutional lawyer advisor
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.360]  to Ron Paul's our guests I want you to continue sir we're going to skip this network break
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:38.280]  because this is so important what I'm saying is you're a constitutional lawyer and obviously
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:44.000]  we have a right to succeed we have a right to revolt my point is I've always been leery
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.160]  of secession because the system just demonizes it as a new civil war and they say it's been
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:53.440]  decided you can't succeed because of what Abraham Lincoln did obviously though this
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.720]  isn't even a question of the federal government being out of control the globalist have taken
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:03.000]  over the federal government so I am saying the way to phrase it and I've seen this get
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.600]  through to people because it's the reality is foreign banks brag they've captured the
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:11.120]  federal government it's totally destroyed the federal system the bill of rights constitution
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:14.240]  they call us anti federalists they're not even following the federal system this is
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:19.880]  globalism this is new world order so what I'm saying is with the dumb down public they
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:24.880]  can grasp secession that we want our own states we're disagreeing with what you're doing it
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:31.200]  will accelerate this process because the feds call states rights secession they call they
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:35.160]  don't think there should be a state and so if states say they should decide what the speed
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:39.840]  limit is you know I mean I'm in Democrats say hey let's just go arrest their governor
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:45.680]  so we know there's a federal globalist socialist tyranny now running Washington they as Ron
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:50.280]  Paul says in his speech it's it's it's over if we don't reverse this I'm saying it's now
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:59.360]  time to up the ante and say okay we call secession kicking out the occupying globalist to restore
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:03.760]  the republic because the feds have been captured we're going to move at the states and start
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:09.480]  having that discussion of a different type of secession to restore the republic because
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:16.480]  you have the states to see saying we're still America DC isn't America doctor and so we're
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:22.200]  going to do it to re upload the bill of rights constitution via the Declaration of Independence
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:27.360]  because the federal government has been lost to foreign special interest that's my point
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:33.800]  is we have to clearly make the break and have the state leaders members of the of the federal
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:39.360]  system start meeting start having discussions start circulating as you know for many years
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:44.320]  you know a new Declaration of Independence or or or redress of grievances they were
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:49.560]  giving to the crown before we got to the codification of what Thomas Jefferson wrote there in the
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:54.960]  weeks leading up to July 4 1776 that's what I'm saying is we need to go ahead and up
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:00.640]  the ante to get the energy going so people understand it's not just this slow movement
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:05.200]  of states rights which the feds just ignore and are now bankrupting the states I mean
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:09.240]  the feds are coming in sir as you know under new rules saying hundred thousand dollar fine
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:14.400]  if you wash your car in your yard six years in jail if your dog craps in your own yard
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:19.360]  excuse my French I mean the the the the the tyranny was dribbling out now the cup has
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:24.960]  been turned over sir so what I'm saying is I'm calling to draft Ron Paul we're writing
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:31.400]  up and codifying a basic battle plan stating hey secession isn't create our other countries
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:36.560]  our country's gone we want the states that created the America to recreate it do you
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:41.520]  see what I'm saying kind of a reboot well yes and I agree with this principle because
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:45.240]  I have said and I have a book coming out very shortly which goes into this in great detail
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:50.560]  that when you talk about the Declaration of Independence for instance it was not really
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:56.880]  a revolutionary document it was a document that looked to the restoration of the principles
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:02.400]  the laws of nature and nature's got a cardam which they believed quite rightly the King
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.200]  George's ministerial government were violating and that's exactly essentially our problem
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:12.680]  today is the same Declaration of Independence type situation you have people in the central
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:17.560]  governmental apparatus lawless criminals well however you want to describe them they are
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:21.240]  violating the fundamental laws of this country they violated the principle of the Declaration
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:25.440]  of Independence through globalism they're violating the laws of nature of nature's got left right
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:31.760]  and center and doing this with impunity and we have a federal system that is built upon
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:36.440]  checks and balances and if we look at that imbalance which is coming out of the District
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:40.000]  of Columbia and ask what are the checks that are supposed to be brought into play well
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.160]  they are too they are the state governments number one because they were in the middle
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.480]  of this pure middle structure and then at the base the thing that forms the foundation
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:54.120]  the people themselves we have been very lax in those two levels in the states essentially
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:59.920]  pushing back against these encroachments coming out of Washington and ultimately in the people
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.520]  not demanding of their state governments as well as the government in Washington that
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:09.160]  these kinds of actions be taken consistent with the Constitution so I say I'm really
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:14.720]  not in favor of the words of session because that tends to throw people's minds back to
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.720]  the historical period of the Civil War.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:22.600]  Okay then what do you exactly so we need to exactly so I have a battle plan we need to
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:28.000]  come up with a basic plan with you and others of what to call it to start our own petitions
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.280]  just because it gets media attention on the White House website so that people see the
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:43.120]  real way so we call for a second state Continental Congress to have the states meet and say what
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:49.680]  do we do about this rogue federal government and so what do we call that sir well I call
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:55.000]  it a committee to restore the constitutional principles in this country I mean cut that
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.760]  down into a sound bite but basically that's what we're doing constitutional principles
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.360]  and of course the principle of the Declaration of Independence because the real danger looming
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:09.120]  down the road is globalism it's the destruction of the separate and equal status among the
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.120]  nations.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.120]  Exactly.
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.120]  Exactly.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.120]  The Declaration of Independence gave us.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.800]  That's it exactly exactly doctor so what I'm asking you as the top constitutional
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:23.760]  lawyer is we need to explain this into a six-year-old level to get it out there because the media
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:31.720]  is phrasing any states rights as Civil War Ku Klux Klan and so and so are you know reconstruction
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.040]  whatever and that's how they want to roll this out I'm saying we just to take control
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:42.840]  of it we label the constitutional restoration movement as secession from the globalist from
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.760]  the occupied federal government not the secession that the Democrats told you about so we need
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:53.640]  to explain that America has been conquered by globalism this is a restoration but how
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:26:00.520]  do you put that out to people to explain because for me that's the key is that folks the government's
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:06.520]  gone that's why it's so lawless they're under technocrats in Europe now this is bonafide
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.760]  I mean I mean Ron Paul's speech lays it out folks we're in it this is real and so I'm
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.120]  saying get the states movements people think it's a petition to Obama that's good to get
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:22.400]  attention with ideas that's like circulating petitions before 1776 as you know but I'm
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:27.880]  saying get petitions going get committee hearings in the state legislatures get this buzz going
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:33.400]  because this is what the whole globalist architecture is set up to block because it's the key to
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.520]  restoring our republic their entire defense is set up against this because this is the
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:46.080]  answer well I think that's right then two things that we wanted to project the idea
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:52.000]  that we maintain our independence from this globalist structure I don't like the idea
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.800]  of saying we're seceding from it because I don't think they've won yet they're close
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.720]  to it but they haven't won yet and I don't like the word secession because the other
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:05.800]  side uses that to bring up the concept of slavery racism and so forth and so on which
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:09.040]  I think is entirely red herring because it doesn't make any difference whether you're
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:15.240]  black or white liberty is the best thing for you period and the discussion right but they
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:22.640]  are going to play on that word constantly in order to divide and conquer people on a
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.080]  racial basis so we don't want to give them that rhetorical okay how do we seize the wave
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:34.400]  though and get the movement going I mean we need Ron Paul yourself Ron Ron Paul makes
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:39.240]  the call and puts together a meeting and invites state and federal legislators and governors
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:44.400]  people will show up it will be seen as a re codification a re issuance of the declaration
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:49.360]  and then a battle plan to go to the states it must happen now Ron Paul's retiring I
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.320]  know he wants to push for internet freedom that's that's the new plan because they had
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.760]  a focus group you know ask all the campaign for liberty people but they wanted that's
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:02.360]  great but that's not the battle plan we have got to draft Ron Paul now to launch this this
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:11.800]  operation and through Ron Paul to find those leaders at the state level who will take a
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:20.000]  position in the forefront that's always been my concern after you go beyond Ron Paul where
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.440]  are the leaders at the state level who are going to perform this function sir right but
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:28.680]  this is his greatest moment that's what I'm saying and with you and with Mr. Fine and
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:34.960]  other constitutional lawyers who have charted from our from our births with the way forward
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:40.160]  we must it's a responsibility there is no doubt that Ron Paul you and others must get
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:47.120]  together this is where campaign for liberty must go well I think that's right and the
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:54.080]  very fact that there is such a groundswell developing in this country yes now is the
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:59.720]  time to take advantage of that it's history sir this is 1776 in my heart and intellectually
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:05.760]  do you I mean do you not feel that and know that sir well it's probably about 1773 probably
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:11.640]  closer to it if you look at the history yes yes but I mean in this way when they started
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:17.160]  organizing politically when they started looking forward to what they feared was going to happen
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.640]  if the king and the ministry didn't exceed to some reforms it took them two or three
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:27.360]  years to get that organization that that structure set up and then finally when the English government
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:33.160]  the British government refused to comply with the colonists justifiable demands then of course
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:36.440]  other things stay there sir walk us through this for five six more minutes on the other
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.280]  side of the mobile clips of the Ron Paul speech exactly I'm saying this is the beginning of
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:44.560]  1776 as I said in the last hour this will take two to three years he didn't even know
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.880]  I said that this is we're on the same page God bless you Dr. Vieira we'll be right back

[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:39.480]  done articles on it paul watson has one they're saying arrest us imprison us strip us of citizenship
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:44.720]  put us in labor camps i mean they're getting 20 30 thousand signatures for these so we're
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.120]  seeing who the democrats are this is what socialists always do once things start imploding they
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:55.440]  go just put the workers in a camp at first it's make them come out and you know dig ditches
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.000]  and it's all about nobody's running your life i mean we know where this leads but the globalists
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.120]  don't care they want total domination they want to start a civil war marching the military
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.520]  and police off to confiscate our guns that bobama is certainly looking at is the nr a
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.800]  documented and is now admitted on banning all semi autos we got to turn them in because
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:18.760]  they don't want us to start a peaceful states rights movement and restore the republic they
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:23.440]  know you're waking up they know europe's waking up this is a banking cartel takeover as ron
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.240]  paul said i'm going to play that clip in about seven eight minutes after constitutional
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:33.200]  lawyer and advisor to ron paul ebb and veera leaves us uh dr i'm going to try to give
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:38.280]  you the floor because i'm so excited at this historical crest repeat to me to folks what
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:42.600]  you told me during the break about ron paul and the mantle and where we're going and
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.760]  that you're that you concur and that you're going to talk to him and everybody else should
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:51.640]  and we're going to get bruce fine constitutional lawyer and advisor ron paul on lou rockwell
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:55.000]  i'm going to call all his sources i'm going to get ahold of ron paul and i'm going to
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:03.400]  say now is the time to step into the leadership to organize as your final you know incredible
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:09.640]  work uh you know this is such a great work that we're talking about here to to build
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:15.200]  the foundation going into this tyranny of the resistance this is it i know ron paul who's
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:21.480]  accepted the draft twice will accept it a third time and uh he has thrown some of the
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:24.400]  little minions out of campaign for liberty that we're saying don't talk about the new
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:29.640]  world order he has exposed the global government to speech dr veera what is your battle plan
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:35.480]  what is your idea that's why we got you on to to get these ideas out to set rush fires
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:41.760]  and then to codify the plan based on our forebearers successful operation well i said to you during
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:47.200]  the break alex uh the first step is for ron paul to come forward and assume the mantle
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:52.720]  leadership here if you look at the parallel uh the american independence movement uh we
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:36:00.680]  had uh just paragons of intellectual political virtue the jefferson the adams the patrick
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:05.680]  henry even the alexander hamilton but there was one man who stood out and had to stand
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.320]  out of course that was george washington and that's exactly what we need at this point
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.240]  in time here is the man of undoubted integrity here is the man who has been telling us and
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:20.280]  warning us about these problems not just for years but for decades here's the man who
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:27.000]  has proven right and he needs to be the figure who stands in the forefront of this movement
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.920]  to restore the constitution of declaration of independence and then he needs to find
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:37.280]  uh really at the state level more than anywhere else i'm not so concerned about finding me
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:46.320]  yet in washington dc but at the state level leaders of that caliber with the integrity
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:52.840]  with the political acumen with the willingness to take on this project not simply because
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.120]  their own political careers might be advanced because initially i think they won't be but
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:02.280]  because the welfare of the american people will be advanced and then he needs to bring
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:10.400]  in with that group a sizable number of advisors who have well what i would call a fair track
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:15.680]  record on these economic and political issues if he wants to call on me as an advisor i'll
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:20.040]  be perfectly willing to come forward and work with and i think that there are probably dozens
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:25.040]  of hundreds of others like me out in the country that would say and do exactly the same thing
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:33.000]  but it needs his leadership he is the national figure here he is the one to whom everyone
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.680]  on either side of the political yellow line if you will recognize that they recognize
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:44.120]  him for his personal integrity they recognize him for the leadership role he's taken at
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:50.880]  the national level and ultimately they recognize this is the man who not only has been right
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:57.840]  but has never compromised his principles which is the real key because what's going on in
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:04.040]  the destruction of our constitutional system is the systematic compromise and prostitution
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:09.200]  of principles for politicians in order to advance their personal careers and this is
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:12.800]  one man who's never done that the only one i could think of really at that level who
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:20.120]  has not done it yes sir so people need to get to him and urge him urge him with a capital
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:29.080]  U to step forward as the essentially his last act in the political arena to take on and
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:36.840]  begin this project i can feel history rising i can feel the spirit of 1776 like i've never
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:41.240]  felt it listeners you you know that this is the most important broadcast we've ever done
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:47.600]  and uh dr viara feels it i see you feel it you can see it and and here's what must be
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.240]  understood campaign for liberty are great people i've gotten mad at some of the folks
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:56.040]  there trying to you know play patty cake some of the young men that have become political
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:00.320]  consultants for the mainline republican party folks that have married into the polls like
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.320]  jessie benton you know people like jack hunter that are involved uh who who you know go out
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:08.920]  to eat with billionaires and kind of get stars in their eyes they're not bad guys they're
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:15.280]  just they're just not ron paul ran paul i've known for 15 16 years he used to come on
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:20.960]  and campaign for his dad uh we he's a good guy he's just up there trying to position
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:25.440]  himself uh you know to be able to win the presidency later and i get that that's not
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:30.360]  going to happen folks in four years in eight years the globalists are going to win or it's
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:35.720]  going to be a civil war we got to be all in now folks that's why they're moving so fast
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:42.240]  i've got three children and i i i've got to sit there with my wife who's extremely intelligent
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:47.000]  and she you know has degrees in history and she's like okay but you know we got to get
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.600]  out of here and she's lived all over the world and her dad worked for the the department
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.920]  of agriculture and she's like we got to get out of here and i've got to say no we're putting
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.240]  it all on the line we're staying i've signed my name to the new declaration of independence
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.880]  i'm all in folks i mean i've got dirty tricks happening to me you wouldn't believe you just
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.800]  it it's like a movie and i'm just like you know what i'm all in because folks there's
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:14.760]  nowhere to run this is history and people that are scared you don't understand you should
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:20.240]  be scared of not taking action and there are people in campaign for liberty who will say
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.680]  oh let's just work with the system let's take over the republicans and they have been getting
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:30.200]  people like crews elected over the neocon you know in the senate here in texas they're
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:33.800]  getting a lot of good people in who at least on the surface are saying the right thing
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:38.400]  so campaign for liberty i've analyzed all this is is dr vieras breaking down he's analyzed
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:41.560]  it campaign for liberty already knows who the good guys are in all the states it's already
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:47.400]  got all our money we gave it it's got everything it is the zenith it is the launch pad it is
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:53.760]  the fulcrum it is the it is the progenitor as i said in the first hour we're three years
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:59.720]  out two to three years we have to launch now history is repeating itself in the entire
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:05.320]  globalist operation is designed to stop a states rights restoration movement that dr
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:10.800]  viera has laid out to ron paul and again ron paul gets his own ideas historically going
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:17.280]  to the same documents but he sources dr viera and his battle plan dr fine you're both constitutional
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:23.840]  your lawyers phd's this is it but i separately have gone and done the research and it is it
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:28.560]  is it is incredible sir thank you so much i hope you'll come back very soon to really
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:32.880]  lay out some battle plans i know you've already laid them out but if if you'd put out articles
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:36.960]  it's it's it's articles that lay it out we're writing an article that others can add to i
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:42.280]  think we should all invade anybody can do it bloodhouse dot gov forward slash petitions
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:49.240]  and everyone should codify their own ideas of a restoration and we see the authoritarian
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:54.200]  lust the democrats want to get a civil war going we need to reach out to the military
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:42:00.200]  and police now this is a very parallel time we're in and they're going to call us a sessionist
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:08.320]  so i just simply say restorationist through the states reconvening a constitutional congress
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:14.000]  and so we need you the constitutional lawyers and others to codify different plans to help
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.080]  ron paul adopt a strategy and to launch now any other points you'd like to make doctor
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:27.240]  america is the last bastion of human freedom in the world today this is our responsibility
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:34.400]  as americans and my view has always been we need to take action immediately if not sooner
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.160]  we can't wait for ron paul do you agree we don't have four to eight years to play patty
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:43.600]  cake with the republicans no because the economic freight train is coming down the tracks at
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:48.240]  us at a very high velocity we can't avoid that and what will be the political consequences
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:53.240]  of a complete breakup of the international banking system and they're going to use that
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:58.840]  meltdown as well they'll try to use it for their benefit and we're facing that and they're
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.720]  not going to be able to prevent it from happening but they're going to try and use it we're
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:09.600]  facing that train wreck and we have to prepare ourselves to deal with that now now now that's
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:15.200]  right that's the operative word i pledge myself doctor to you and dr paul i pledge myself
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:20.840]  to my family before god on the altar of liberty as thomas everson said i swear eternal resistance
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:25.600]  to every form of tyranny over the mind of humankind and i know you pledge with me now
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.520]  on the listeners pledge we aren't going to stop we're drafting ron paul we're drafting

[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:53.920]  absolutely i've been doing that for a long time i know but i'm just all of us here together
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:59.160]  that's right we have our work cut out for us what is the what's the old saying when

[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:11.920]  it had to get bad before people get up that's right and now is the time and they want to
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:16.480]  start the civil war with the gun confiscation we've got a race now to to accelerate our
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:22.000]  operations against them it may be able to back them off and buy us time but sir what

[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:05.920]  a particularly powerful part of the forty nine minute speech that ron paul gave on the
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:12.520]  house floor he called it questions excessive government has created such a mess it prompts
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:16.080]  many questions he goes through those will go to break with that and we're going to come
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:22.720]  back with his conclusion how we've been conquered by world government only admitting we've been
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:28.680]  conquered fraudulently you gotta admit you're a slave before you start becoming free and
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:40.320]  and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.920]  it rise me up in all the things that happened in my life to to prepare me for this moment
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:50.200]  of what we're beginning now the bell cannot be unwrung to know with surety that we're
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:56.280]  going to win if god be with us who can stand against us and it's time for everyone who's
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:02.240]  in thought and everything else to repent before god i even repent for nasty things i've said
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:06.040]  about glenn beck i should have responded to him more gentlemanly i apologize for when
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:10.360]  he said bad things about me being worldly we don't have time for this we don't have time
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:15.440]  to fight with each other anymore we don't have time for all this petty stuff we have
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:21.880]  got to come together all of us so i repent for my trespasses do you repent for yours
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:27.800]  all of my enemies out there please come in for the big win please realize how much trouble
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:35.600]  we're in realize how much danger in these globalists are dangerous we we have to get
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:40.440]  involved now we have to get aggressive now we have to go out and wake up everybody we
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:46.560]  can now and then we come back in the next segment his conclusion you know we've put
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.040]  with this show eugenics back on the map we've put the fact that we're conquered on the map
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:56.560]  with that nomenclature the truth the truth will set us free admit how far we've fallen
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:02.920]  admit how pathetic we've gotten only then can we rise again and ron paul is now getting
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:08.600]  more hardcore because that's all he can do now that ron paul's leaving congress now that
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:13.400]  his sons in the senate all this ron paul it's time to come out both barrels i know you're
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:21.880]  a man after my own heart i know you know what i know say it all lay it out throw yourself
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:28.960]  against the new world order and all of us will as well and let all the rest of the campaign
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.320]  for liberty establishment types that have infiltrated let them hit the streets they're
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:38.360]  already getting their big republican jobs i know you've purged them good good because
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:43.560]  there is no future now all in here's part of ron paul's speech we're gonna break and
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:47.320]  finish up with the rest of it here he is saying some questions and he lists the incredible
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:52.120]  tyranny we're under and i have some other points here it is have a few questions excessive
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:58.960]  government has created such a mess it prompts many questions why are sick people who are
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:05.760]  who use medical marijuana put in prison why does the federal government restrict the drinking
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:12.520]  of raw milk why can't american manufacturers manufacturers rope and other products from
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:18.640]  the hemp why are americans not allowed to use gold and silver as legal tender as mandated
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:24.440]  by the constitution why is germany concerned enough to consider repatriating their gold
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:31.360]  held by the fed for her in new york is it that the trust in the u.s. and dollar supremacy
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:37.680]  beginning to wane why do our political leaders believe it's necessary to thoroughly audit
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:43.680]  our own goal why can't americans decide which type of light bulbs they can buy why is it
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:50.400]  the tsa permitted to abuse the rights of any american traveling by air why should there
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:57.080]  be mandatory sentences even up to life for crimes without victims as our drug laws require
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:02.920]  why have we allowed the federal government to regulate commodes in our homes and we're
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:08.520]  why have we allowed the federal government to regulate commodes in our homes why is it
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:14.320]  political suicide for anyone to criticize a pack why haven't we given up on the drug
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:21.200]  war since it's an obvious failure and violates the people's rights has nobody noticed that
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:27.200]  the authorities can't even keep drugs out of the prisons i can making our entire society
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:34.360]  a prison solve the problem why do we sacrifice so much getting this and get necessarily involved
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:40.040]  in border disputes and civil strife around the world and ignore the root cause of the
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:46.480]  most dangerous deadly border in the world the one between mexico and the united states
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:53.200]  why does congress willingly give up its prerogatives to the executive branch why is changing the
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:59.520]  party in power never change policy could it be that the views of both parties are essentially
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:05.640]  the same why did the big banks the large corporations and foreign banks and foreign central banks
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:13.560]  get bailed out in 2008 and the middle class lost their jobs and their homes why do so
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:18.720]  many in the government and the federal officials believe that creating money out of thin air
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:24.320]  creates wealth why do so many except the deeply flawed principle the government bureaucrats
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:30.600]  and politicians can protect us from ourselves without totally destroying the principle of
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:35.520]  liberty why can't people understand that we're gonna come back and finish up the wide part
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:40.080]  of this and we're gonna get to the most powerful the whole thing that he says we have a cancerous
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:44.920]  group of psychopaths that's a quote running things i mean he lays it all out world government
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:51.560]  we're conquered it is unbelievable 49 minutes and we're just gonna cover it and cover it
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:57.760]  and cover it uh ron paul is standing up i mean it's time to go 110 percent into the
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:04.720]  eye of the enemy imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the

[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:13.000]  you probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:19.560]  what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012 obama's secret war on coal that
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:24.600]  could increase your already high power bill as much as 400 percent in coming months as
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:29.000]  shocking as it sounds it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going

[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:49.800]  down I'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine in the idea I'm not going
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:55.080]  to live as a slave okay I mean these globalists are nasty folks these are eugenicists they've
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:01.040]  got a covert war going on against us an undeclared secret war with the chemicals and biologicals
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:06.680]  in our food and water we're far gone we need to get back in their face all of you people
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:12.520]  that serve the system your victims as well you fools we got a breakaway civilization
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:17.200]  of technocrats that think they're going to be able to take everything over man we're
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:22.040]  in trouble wanted large banks large corporations and foreign banks and foreign central banks
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:26.560]  get bailed out in 2008 and the middle class lost their jobs in their homes let's continue
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:31.720]  with this out the rest of the segment and coming up after loot Rockwell and others I'm
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:35.680]  going to I'm going to play about five minutes where he has his summation and boy he breaks
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:41.080]  down that we're under global government unelected global government run by eugenicists let's
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:46.400]  go ahead and go back to his questions here it is without totally destroying the principle
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:52.640]  of liberty why can't people understand that war always destroys wealth and liberty why
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:58.560]  is there no so little concern for the executive order that gives the president authority to
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:05.800]  establish a kill list including American citizens of those targeted for assassination why is
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:11.000]  patriotism thought to be blind loyalty to the government and the politicians who run
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:17.600]  it rather than loyalty to the principles of liberty and support for the people real patriotism
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:24.320]  is a willingness to challenge the government when it's wrong why is it claimed that if
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:29.200]  people won't or can't take care of their own needs that people in government are able to
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:37.680]  do it for them why did we ever give the government a safe haven for initiating violence against
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:44.320]  the people why do so many members defend free markets but not civil liberties why do so many
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:51.320]  members defend civil liberties but not free markets aren't they the same why don't more
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:56.600]  defend both economic liberty and personal liberty why are there no more individuals who seek
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:02.720]  to intellectually influence others to bring about positive changes those who seek power
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:10.080]  changes than those who seek power to force others to obey their commands why does the
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:15.080]  use of religion to support a social gospel and preemptive wars both of which require
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:21.680]  authoritarians to use violence or the threat of violence go unchallenged aggression and
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:27.240]  forced redistribution of wealth has nothing to do with the teachings of the world's great
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:32.520]  religions why do we allow the government and the Federal Reserve to disseminate false
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:38.680]  information dealing with both economic and foreign policy why is democracy out in such
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:47.160]  high esteem when it's the enemy when it's the enemy of the minority and makes all rights
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:52.800]  relative to the dictates of the majority why should anyone be surprised that congress
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:58.680]  has no credibility since there's such a disconnect between what politicians say and what they
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:05.320]  do is there any explanation for all the deception the unhappiness the fear of the future the
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:10.440]  loss of confidence in our leaders yes trust in the anger there is a station because we're
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:16.920]  under arrest there is and there's a way we're gonna break attitude we come back we are going

[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:08.800]  to be able to break down for folks with what's happening dealing with the economy well in
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:13.400]  the from the economy standpoint i've got some numbers for you on these supposed efforts

[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:21.640]  be able to do it and in regards to obama's third term i'd really like people to see
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:27.560]  that there's a connection between something that's going on in the oil business and presidential
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:36.680]  politics continuing as well you'll cuey unlimited has begun and they are talking about all these
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:43.560]  major currencies going down will people even notice if the big event accelerates i think
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:46.520]  people are definitely going to notice the fact that their purchasing power is being
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:54.520]  eliminated by the ongoing inflation that the governor refuses to recognize the website
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:03:00.760]  folks if you want to see the breakdown the video presentation is w w w dot three r d
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:08.960]  term one dot com that's the number three just the numeral three just three r d term one
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:17.480]  third term one dot com is the best way for people people to find that url and i do think
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:21.440]  we should discuss this because if we don't discuss the fact that democratic operatives
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:25.320]  are in newspapers that you point out your presentation up on the site if we don't point
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:28.640]  out that they're pushing this and that they're trying to float the idea like a little bit
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:32.240]  swords and anger to change the 22nd amendment so he can run for president they're going
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:36.960]  to end up doing it i mean he just signed an executive order today and made it secret what
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:41.240]  his new cyber security takeover is but we know what the bill was even cbs news said it's
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:48.640]  a takeover of the internet chinese style control yeah well you know if you if you just look
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:55.760]  and see what he what he's been doing to win these elections by ramping up the enormous
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:02.520]  amounts of spending that the government's giving directly to individuals 750 billion
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.760]  dollars now on welfare programs to go directly to individuals food samples that have increased
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:13.040]  by 50 percent in his presidency if you take just those people who get food stamps that's
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:18.120]  like 75 percent of the people that voted for him so he you know he the democratic party
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:23.080]  are engineering these election victories and i don't think it's reasonable to believe
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:28.240]  that he could find a way to engineer the repeal of the 22nd amendment but even if he doesn't
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:33.160]  do that alex that doesn't necessarily mean that he won't have a third term he could have
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:37.640]  a proxy and i that's one of the things i talk about he could put up eric holder for
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:42.400]  example to be the next president while he actually remains in control of the administration
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:47.720]  much like toton has done in russia oh yeah putin with minidiev and then he came back
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:55.320]  again minidiev always have trouble pronouncing it for stansbury incredible mind writer researcher

[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:25.560]  wwe dot three rd term one dot com
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:27.440]  third term one
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:31.960]  the numbers are just single numbers not not spelled out three rd term one
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:33.800]  three rd term one
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.320]  and i gotta say yeah they are floating articles everywhere
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:38.480]  saying
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:41.520]  in the news right now hey obama should run for a third term
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:44.640]  bring into this the latest on the economy q three
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:48.400]  what he sees happening the first i gotta ask you porter
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:50.840]  what do you make of them saying you didn't build it
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:54.360]  we're gonna bankrupt america we're gonna confiscate all semi-automatic rifles
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:55.280]  and handguns
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.920]  and democrats are really saying hey
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:01.560]  let's start arresting people and your racist if you don't like world
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:02.840]  government i mean
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:05.760]  i mean with the this is even last year that i thought it would be
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:08.720]  this is crazy i mean why do you think they're trying to totally take over right
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:09.840]  now
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:11.440]  i think you know
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:14.160]  i think they believe that they have the votes that they have the power of
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:15.680]  people behind them
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:18.840]  i think if you look at what's going on our country
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:22.680]  they've uh... you know this idea of class warfare is really materialized
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:23.760]  where
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:28.000]  you have a half of the people that vote that voted for obama receiving
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.840]  enormous direct federal handouts
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.360]  uh... you know they
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:35.400]  the the democratic party has perfected this uh...
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:36.640]  this machine
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:38.160]  that buys elections
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:39.000]  and
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.240]  they're gonna see how far they can take that because it doesn't look like the
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:43.680]  republicans
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:45.600]  can get organized enough to stop them
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:49.040]  well that's because they're part of the same globalist system where do you think
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:52.560]  the power structure is trying to take us porter
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:55.760]  well just look at you know just sort of look with uh... look what's going on
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:59.040]  the country uh... you have you have the highest
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:03.560]  amount of dependence on the government in the history of the united states
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:06.960]  at the same time you have the federal government beginning to break apart
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:08.280]  financially
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:12.360]  let me let me throw this number out at you alexand you tell me where it leads
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:16.280]  right now the government is spending the federal government is spending
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:20.680]  fifty five thousand dollars per household in the united states
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:24.200]  there are a hundred fourteen million households
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:29.720]  spending fifty five thousand dollars per household on government in the united states right now
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:34.840]  the average income per household is only fifty thousand dollars the united states
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:38.840]  does that make any sense is there any country in the world that can spend more on
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:39.880]  government that
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:41.520]  earns an income
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:44.600]  it leads towards designed implosion
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:48.120]  and the weekly standard said it's sixty one thousand breaking down congressional
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:49.840]  numbers but let's just say fifty
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:51.160]  five thousand
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:53.840]  the average welfare household is getting
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:57.960]  uh... and they are bringing us into debt servitude they are deindustrializing the
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:12:58.880]  country
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:01.400]  under agenda twenty one we are being conquered
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:03.720]  just like stalin conquered ukraine
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:06.880]  by uh... turning off the economy
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:09.720]  well
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:12.040]  i just look at the numbers side of things and
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:14.560]  i can't find any plausible
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:15.720]  reason
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:16.240]  that
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:20.640]  that either party would run the country this way uh... they're
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:24.400]  generations of americans to poverty and dependence
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:26.920]  and uh... they're doing it by all
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:31.960]  you know by bribing these uh... ignorant uh... voters who believe anything they
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:32.920]  read
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:36.520]  and will do whatever they have to do to get a free buck that's worse than that
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:39.840]  uh... more and more democrats and then they talk about it on all the shows bill
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:41.280]  mar talks about it
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:44.680]  they say they're gonna just arrest us and put us in forced labor camps
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:47.800]  i'm not joking that's in the new army manuals i mean they're gonna come
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:50.280]  literally put us on plantations porter
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:54.760]  and let let big fat government swabs beat our brains out rape our wives i mean
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:57.640]  that's really there and i'm not kidding that's what they want to do
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:01.360]  well they're not going to do that to me alex i'm uh... i'm prepared to uh...
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:04.360]  believe that they can turn out like that no no no but i'm listening i want
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:08.920]  listeners to know i'm not joking they are licking their lips misery loves
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:12.760]  company they just want to wreck and and and just decimate everything
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:15.120]  i mean this is what happens in every other country and and look at how
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:16.200]  decadent we are
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:19.160]  and ron paul talked about in this farewell speech he said we are
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.120]  incredibly immoral and evil we are run by
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.560]  uh... authoritarian psychopaths
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:27.960]  i mean i mean let me tell you we cannot underestimate porter how bad it's gonna
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:28.840]  get
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:32.600]  i agree with you completely on the economic side of things and i thought
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:34.560]  that ron paul's farewell speech
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:35.560]  was the
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:39.720]  uh... most poignant political speech i have seen our country since
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:40.360]  um...
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:43.000]  uh... george washington's farewell address
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.760]  um... it's it's it's that should be mandatory
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:49.360]  uh... for every american to watch and listen to think about
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:53.040]  he's the only political leader in the united states who is willing to tell
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:55.960]  americans the truth about our government which is
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:02.160]  one that were financially bankrupt and two that were morally bankrupt
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:05.360]  america is dead uh... basically dr paul
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:09.920]  uh... but but but we're not physical we can be resurrected but we're dead it's
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:11.560]  over we're far gone
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.040]  uh... by design
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:14.240]  we've been conquered
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:17.280]  and now we're about to be deindustrialized porter break down
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:20.400]  what you think obama's planning from his own operative statements
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:23.920]  during the implosion he'll be the f d r that saves us break that down and
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:25.400]  stay in office
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:30.040]  well you know uh... alexa i think the one thing that's going on in our country
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:31.000]  right now
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.440]  that could delay the fiscal implosion
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:38.720]  is the the renaissance in the oil and gas industry in america it's very
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:40.760]  powerful it's very real
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:44.880]  and uh... it's going to produce a lot more revenue and a lot more power for
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:46.280]  politicians
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:50.400]  and that is going to uh... with the way i see things if you look at people who
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:52.720]  ran for president for three terms
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:56.240]  it's teddy roosevelt franklindelna roosevelt and obama
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:59.000]  and they all have certain things in common they are all populist they all
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.240]  spend a lot of money on the people
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:03.760]  and they are of course all very progressive
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:06.160]  but the other thing they had in common was
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:09.000]  in nineteen oh one there was an oil boom from spindle top
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.240]  and nineteen thirty there is an oil boom
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:12.440]  from east texas
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:17.000]  and right now going on in america is the biggest renaissance in oil since nineteen
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.720]  thirty it's the shale boom
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:23.000]  and all this oil is producing a huge revenue for the feds
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.280]  and also
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:26.840]  enormous power for obama because
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:30.360]  right now it's against the law to export
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:31.520]  oil
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:35.640]  and so he has the ability to grant licenses that could be worth hundreds of
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:37.760]  billions of dollars to corporations
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:41.520]  and of course he's going to use that power and all that leverage
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:43.360]  to propel himself into a third term
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:47.280]  and yesterday the commerce department announced that the united states is now
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:49.040]  the number one producer in the world
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:51.720]  surpassing saudi arabia
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:55.600]  yeah uh... most americans don't realize uh... what's happened over the last three
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:57.480]  or four years in the oil fields
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:16:59.680]  uh... there's been a huge renaissance in oil
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:02.360]  everywhere i drive in texas they're drilling
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:07.720]  yeah and listen alex uh... that's undeniably bullish for our economy
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:12.720]  and it could absolutely sustain our currency for another five or ten years
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:16.720]  this is going to really impact our trade deficits
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:20.200]  and assuming that we begin to export this excess energy
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:23.400]  it could really help the balance of trade for our country
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:24.840]  but in the process
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:28.440]  it's going to make an icon out of obama because he's going to take all this money
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:29.880]  like chavez did
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:32.040]  and he's going to buy more votes tomorrow
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:35.480]  which is exactly what teddy roosevelt did and that's exactly what fdr did
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:38.760]  well that's what uh... lindsay williams was saying is that after they imploded
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:40.880]  the economy they would bring in
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:44.600]  all this new oil and that that would uh... buoy things better than the rest of
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:47.920]  the world but they'll still be an overall global depression
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:50.080]  or are you saying things will turn around
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:53.760]  or you're saying they'll use this is the process of socialization
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:58.760]  i'm saying that this will this is going to prevent an economic collapse
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:00.880]  for a certain amount of time
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:03.600]  instead of investing this money wisely
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:05.880]  to set our country back on sound footing
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:09.880]  they're going to use it to buy more power and more influence and in the process
[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:11.920]  of course they're going to squander
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:14.600]  this incredible natural resource that we have
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:18.080]  and then that's going to put us even further in the hole
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:20.800]  so no matter how much resource you have
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:25.280]  it doesn't matter, venezuela is still a poor country and they have more oil and gas resources
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:27.200]  than any other place in the world
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:30.600]  right? so why can't they get their stuff together?
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:32.280]  and the answer is because
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:33.400]  politically
[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:36.640]  they're using this resource for exactly all the wrong thing
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:40.640]  no no ten years ago they had power on everywhere now the power is out half the time
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:45.080]  folks you can see the full breakdown of this in an amazing video presentation
[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:47.840]  at 3rdterm1.com
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:53.960]  i hope everybody goes there it's a 3rdterm1.com just the number three
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:59.960]  uh... and uh... rdterm1.com we should link to this up at infowars.com
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:04.600]  you can also go to the 3rdterm spelled out it will also work
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:06.600]  3rdterm1.com will also work
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:09.600]  yeah i just keep giving it a knock because i'm worried it's kind of a long URL
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:12.760]  it's kind of a tricky URL but just 3rdterm1.com
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:17.080]  just go there and you'll see the whole presentation
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:20.280]  but again this will allow them to get more people on welfare
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:24.600]  and then they will see obama did it, it's so sick
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:29.920]  yeah well you know that he's going to take credit for all this stuff even though of course he's been against it the whole time
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:34.080]  but it doesn't matter because there's so much money to be made in this i mean
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:39.040]  alex you can't imagine how how valuable this stuff is just think about this for one second
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:43.440]  the price of wti oil that's the price of oil in the united states
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:45.480]  is about eighty five dollars a barrel
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:49.720]  the price of oil anywhere else in the world is about a hundred and twenty five dollars a barrel

[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:25.160]  to take the states back we got to have the states get together and say we're
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:29.440]  nullifying you want to call that's a session whatever you succeeded you were
[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:33.680]  taken over by the globalist that coffin nails to these people we're going to
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:37.120]  draft Ron Paul to get that message out because he gave that message out in his
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:43.880]  speech and that's coming up Porter you're right Putin you've got folks that
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:49.840]  Argentina using oil to stay in power you've got Venezuela with Chavez and
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:54.520]  there is an oil boom we're now numero uno number one oil producer in the
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:58.880]  world and it's something that cartels can control and that Obama can
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:02.920]  manipulate please continue and how that ties in what will he do in that third
[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:08.640]  term I mean we're talking about dictator Obama pretty much here what I think
[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:12.360]  it's clear if you look around the world there's a leak between oil and
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:17.080]  dictatorship and the reason is of course is that oil delivers incredible
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:22.320]  amounts of wealth and whoever controls that wealth has all the power so if you
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:25.560]  look at the cursors in Argentina there was a husband and then there was a wife
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:29.640]  and they've they've kept control of the government for a decade now good Michelle
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:35.440]  Obama run and four years I don't see why not but I personally think it's going to
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:39.800]  be a stooge it's going to be an Eric Holder type guy that's assuming that he
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:43.560]  can't just flat out buy his way out of the 22nd Amendment which I think he'll
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:47.960]  be able to and let me give you some facts that you can focus on okay this is
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:53.240]  the things you should watch for right now there are a dozen US companies 12
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:26:00.240]  US companies that have filed for a license to export LNG which is liquefied
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:04.800]  natural gas and Alex I know you're aware that there is a there is a huge
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:09.960]  blood of natural gas the United States the prices of natural gas have fallen so low that
[02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:13.040]  the companies are flaring the stuff off rather than bothering to put it through
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:15.920]  the pipeline they're just keeping it in the ground they got it turned down boy am
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:19.080]  I aware of that yeah okay so there's nothing wrong with the selling this
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:24.280]  stuff overseas because we're drowning in it okay but they can't Obama has sat on
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:29.120]  these licenses for over a year he will not give anyone a license to export the
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:33.920]  LNG why well very simply no one's paid him enough money yet they all wanted to
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:36.920]  see whether he would win this election now that he's won the election he's
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:41.000]  gonna collect think about what happened when he gave up his Senate seat in
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:45.200]  Illinois remember the governor there a blog of it yes remember what he said
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:49.280]  over the FBI wiretap he said this thing is effing valuable I'm gonna get
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:54.080]  something for it right yes well they'll believe me these licenses are worth a
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:27:00.200]  lot more than a stupid Senate seat these things are worth tens or hundreds of
[02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:05.720]  billions of dollars because the price of natural gas in Japan is $16 at NCF it's
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:10.640]  also a way to cut Russia off cut Russia off from Europe rushes playing blackmail
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:14.560]  with their natural gas they're gonna have those super tankers ship that stuff
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:21.080]  to Europe this stuff is this energy we have is the most valuable thing in the
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:25.760]  world's economy it's valuable politically it's valuable in terms of the
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:30.320]  macro politics of the globe and most importantly it's it's powerful
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:34.480]  politically it gives him enormous amounts of power in the country so if he
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.120]  says hey I'll give you a license as long as you back my third term what's he
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:43.480]  gonna get he's gonna get the third term well we're gonna get the third term so
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:47.680]  he's gonna buy off the poor with with welfare he's gonna buy off the
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:54.960]  corporations with energy is there any way to stop this nightmare because I mean
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:59.240]  he says he's gonna try to ban semi-auto guns that will start a civil war and then
[02:27:59.240 --> 02:28:02.320]  I guess all the corporations will line up behind him to just take over America
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:05.720]  as long as they can make some money I don't think there's any way to stop this
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:11.000]  as long as you have the system in place we have where so few people support so
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:16.160]  many others I mean look we're a 10% of the people United States are paying for
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:21.120]  75% of Obama's largest half the people in the country are dependent upon the
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:28.400]  federal government you know 50 million people are getting food stamps you can
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:33.960]  in a democracy this is just completely destructive because you bought all the
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:39.160]  voters and hey analysis you know that in the last election only 51% of the
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:45.560]  eligible Americans even bothered to vote I know listen Porter I gotta have you
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:49.200]  back up soon for a full hour because you talk about the zombies it is getting
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:52.680]  frightening when people you tell them about all the tyranny these yuppies and
[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:56.160]  people giggle and laugh they're so disconnected from reality they've never
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:58.840]  had their butt kicked they've never been in the military they've never been
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:02.200]  mugged they've never gone hungry they've never worked a day in their life and they
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.920]  think it's all funny I have no idea what these idiots are gonna think when it
[02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:12.800]  all collapses well you know they're not gonna do very well I can guarantee you
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:17.080]  that I thought for a long time what would happen if the if the food stamps
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:20.080]  checks wouldn't clear you know if there was so much inflation that the food
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:23.760]  stamps wouldn't buy you food anymore what would happen to an urban setting like
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:27.760]  Baltimore or what would happen in Houston and I think those people who are
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:30.880]  ignoring these fiscal problems and who are ignoring what's happened to the
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:34.600]  morality of our country are gonna be a rude awakening one day absolutely the

[02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:36.800]  tonight tomorrow the Sunday show I want to play about a three four minute clip
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:40.200]  before we get blue Rockwell on to talk about the secession movement and the
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:43.280]  threats that are flying from the feds and their cohorts who want to have a
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:46.480]  military conflict with the American people the socialists on their sites are
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:49.880]  it's time to arrest him it's time to go in with the militias we'll take
[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:52.600]  everything they've gotten redistributed and these are all like these little
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:56.640]  spindly-necked wimps who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag you dirty
[02:33:56.640 --> 02:33:59.880]  little commies go ahead and try to start a fight see what happens to you you
[02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:03.840]  make me want to throw up how you work for the foreign banks and you know for
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:07.960]  you know every three shillings the new order gets you get one I mean it's
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:11.880]  disgusting how you've sold everything out your socialism and your fake moral
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:17.200]  high ground the rest of it it's just unbelievable at parasites you are but I
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:22.240]  want to play Ron Paul here in his summation from his speech because he
[02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:26.960]  talks about world government and how we're under world government now
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:31.000]  commanding our military and then we'll go to Lou Rockwell of Lou Rockwell dot com
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:39.200]  here is Ron Paul's conclusion to the 48 49 minute powerhouse speech that's up at
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:45.360]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com here it is in conclusion what are
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:51.160]  the greatest dangers that the American people face today that impede the goal
[02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:56.520]  of a free society there are five the continuous attack on our civil liberties
[02:34:56.520 --> 02:35:02.440]  which threaten the rule of law and our ability to resist the onrush of tyranny
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:09.080]  number two violent anti-Americanism that has engulfed the world because the
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:13.960]  phenomenon of blowback is not understood or denied our foreign policy is
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:18.760]  destined to keep us involved in many wars that we have no business being in
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:23.400]  national bankruptcy and a greater threat to our national security will
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:29.520]  result number three the ease in which we go to war without a declaration by
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:34.520]  congress but accepting international authority from the UN or NATO even from
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:40.840]  for preemptive wars otherwise known as aggression a financial political crisis
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:45.480]  as a constant number four a financial political crisis as a consequence of
[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:50.440]  excessive debt unfunded liability spending bail us in gross discrepancy and
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:56.440]  wealth distribution going from the middle class to the rich the danger of
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:02.440]  central economic planning by the Federal Reserve must be understood world
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:06.520]  government taking over local and u.s. sovereignty by getting involved in the
[02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:12.960]  issues of war welfare trade banking a world currency taxes property ownership
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:18.960]  and private ownership of guns must be addressed happily there's an answer for
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:22.680]  these very dangerous trends what a wonderful world it would be if everyone
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:26.760]  accepted the simple moral premise of rejecting all acts of aggression the
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:31.840]  retort to such a suggestion is always too simplistic too idealistic impractical
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:38.160]  naive utopian dangerous and unrealistic to strive for such an ideal the answer
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:41.800]  to that is after thousands of years the acceptance of government force to rule
[02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:45.480]  over the people at the sacrifice of liberty was considered moral and the
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:49.680]  only available option for achieving peace and prosperity what could be more
[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:53.920]  utopian than that now considering the results especially looking at the state
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:58.480]  sponsored killing by nearly every government during the 20th century
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:03.040]  estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of people it's time to reconsider
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:07.640]  this grant of authority to the state no good has ever come from granting
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:11.920]  monopoly power to the state to use aggression we are going to air all of
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:17.920]  this on the Sunday radio show over two hours I'm gonna be there playing five
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:22.680]  minute clips commenting it is the greatest political speech that I've ever
[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:27.320]  seen because it's not political it's about reality Ron Paul is calling for a
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:32.040]  return of reality and sanity and I've never been more proud to know Ron Paul
[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:36.280]  I've never been more proud to know he's right and historically the
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:40.560]  collectivism despite all its promises is a nightmare and how he indicted the
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:45.360]  mega banks taking us over the world government the the the the preparations
[02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:50.680]  for mass arrest he laid it out and said folks we have psychopathic
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:54.840]  authoritarians these are quotes I mean this is the speech that I would like to
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:58.240]  write because I'm always wanting to do a whole film just breaking down the
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:03.960]  continuum of it and he's done it and and I have announced that's why today I had
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:07.280]  an epiphany last night I knew the states right movement was what the globalists
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:11.400]  were preparing for because they know it's the constitutional remedy they're
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:16.360]  spinning secession like it's the civil war and racist and saying there's gonna
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:19.960]  be violence and that Obama needs to write in like Lincoln and arrest people
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:23.280]  this is petitions at the White House now I mean I've got them right here where
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:27.300]  they say arrest us all this this isn't even what I call secession it's the
[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:30.760]  states saying the federal government sold out the foreign corporate interest
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:35.200]  the globalist world government now commanding our military NATO they brag
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:38.360]  in the newspaper we've been conquered by foreign banks we've got to have Ron
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:41.600]  Paul go out with that message with campaign for liberty that knows where
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:46.360]  all the patriots are at I have competing ideas for a reissuance of the
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:50.800]  original Declaration of Independence with a battle plan to say you're a
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:54.200]  legitimate Federal Reserve you've hijacked the country you've now got
[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:59.720]  governing power under the Dodd-Frank bill I mean we're in trouble and and we
[02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:04.800]  repudiate this and what it is is it's a it's a it's a platform to challenge them
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:08.480]  and then people see legitimacy in government so through the states even
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:12.720]  though you know they're more legitimate in the feds there's still a problem we
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:17.880]  can literally beat these people it's the best platform it needs to be led by
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:22.600]  Ron Paul as I said in the first hour Lou Rockwell Evan Vieira Bruce Fine and
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:28.200]  other constitutional lawyers and men of true integrity okay that and any there's
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:31.120]  some women out there that have fought tyranny with integrity I'm not even
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:36.120]  saying I'm in this rodeo but I'm I've rung the bell and I know this is the
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:40.640]  battle plan and this is the way to go we have to offensively because there's a
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:44.880]  hunger now it's 1.3 million signatures all 50 states are about to qualify for a
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:48.680]  White House response sure you don't go to the government the feds and say give
[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:52.600]  up your power but it but but it's it's attacking the articles on the door it's
[02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:56.800]  it's letting them know it's a declaration of independence by the people
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:40:00.840]  that we're not going to be slaves under socialism for the blue states all
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:04.280]  sucking their thumbs and we don't want the Republican governors either telling
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:08.440]  us go along who we're squealing we but again they're gonna spin this we're
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:11.760]  going to do Rockwell that I don't know what his take is gonna be on this but I
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:15.880]  think it'll be with me because it's constitutional it's historical it's a
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:19.880]  reissuance of the Declaration of Independence it's a reupload of that
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:23.480]  but the feds have been seized by globalist it's totally special interest
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:27.720]  as Ron Paul said we have to start with states that have enough moral people and
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:32.240]  enough producers left to stand up and say I'm not a slave it's the new civil
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:35.640]  rights movement it's the real civil rights movement we are going to have a
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:40.160]  state stand up with petitions at the legislature legislatures voting to say
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:44.600]  full annulment we do not recognize you anymore we are America we are the
[02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:48.960]  Republic so not even succession it's pulling out of the occupied federal
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:53.760]  government to reestablish the Republic now now again we have to get our own
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:57.880]  petitions not that they matter at the federal level except in the image the
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:01.000]  whole world's a stage each of his players upon it it's a real stage of
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  life and death but it's how you present it and so we need Lou Rockwell to come
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:09.760]  up with ideas Ron Paul Ron Paul must put on the mantle as constitutional lawyer
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:14.240]  Vieira said who advises Paul he totally agreed with my plan we must launch it
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:19.480]  now the flood has come we must surf this thing or it's over they're gonna start a
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:23.800]  civil war okay they're coming for you the authoritarians know times running out
[02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:28.800]  Lou I got you on and I'm ranting here I'm so excited because a few times in my
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:33.240]  life things have crystallized and I know when I'm right I know when I've done
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:37.160]  the historical research and I know when the zeitgeist is there and I have never
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:42.280]  this is ten times the electricity I've ever felt Lou Rockwell what do you say
[02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:45.720]  to what I've just laid out here all I'm laying out is what our country was
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:50.160]  founded on can we rediscover the Republic can it rise again will you help
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:55.280]  us get Ron Paul to lead this exploratory movement to really get aggressive
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:58.880]  well certainly Alex Ron Paul is the leader as we saw in this you know
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:03.160]  fantastic farewell to Congress speech at one of the great speeches of all of
[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:07.520]  American history he is the leader he's gonna continue to be the leader I would
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:10.600]  say he's gonna be a more effective leader now that he's out of electoral
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:15.040]  politics he's got many wonderful things in store for us plans that he can't
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:18.880]  disclose quite yet but after the first of the year when he's no longer in
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:23.880]  Congress is just wait for there's gonna be great stuff ahead but this this
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:27.560]  principle of you know it's I hate to quote Woodrow Wilson he referred to it
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:33.120]  as self-determination principle of secession Livy von Mises famously said
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:36.960]  more than a hundred years ago that no people are part of a people shall be
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:42.120]  held in a political allegiance or alliance to which it's opposed it's
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:45.520]  wrong this is in fact an ancient Catholic principle goes back to the
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:49.640]  Middle Ages of decentralization that with certain things should be handled
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:53.520]  the level of the individual others at the level of the family others at the
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:59.520]  level of the local community and you do not have the higher governments in
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:04.920]  society controlling the lower you have it just just the reverse so this this
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:11.720]  policy of decentralization of secession is absolutely a key principle of human
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:15.320]  liberty Jefferson talked about it he talked about the worst thing that could
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:19.440]  happen to this country is we'd get a consolidated government a centralized
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:23.240]  government but it's it's one of the bad things about government many bad things
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:26.920]  about government one of the bad things about government is they all get
[02:43:26.920 --> 02:43:32.600]  together to increase centralization Hans Hoppe has pointed out why this is in
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:35.920]  their interest so that you have whether it's what's happening in the EU
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:40.800]  individual countries conglomerating together to make a to make a unified
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:43.640]  state in Europe or at least that's what they want already happened in this
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:47.840]  country we've had state and local authority needless as individual
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:52.360]  authority and other sorts of private authority wiped out or crushed by the
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:55.240]  federal government as it's become more and more of a centralized state these
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:43:58.560]  people of course all want a world government they want you know they want
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:04.360]  a North American Union they want they want they want a world government just
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:08.960]  the sort of horror that John Maynard Keynes used to campaign for and every
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:13.960]  other terrible person political person maybe in the history of the human race
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:17.960]  I'm sure the Pharaoh wanted to be head of the world too so all the all these guys
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:23.520]  want this but on the on the other side of power glory for the state
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:30.320]  conglomeration centralization stepping on other people killing mass killing mass
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:34.040]  spying all the wonderful things the government does to us and to and to
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:38.200]  people in other countries there is that you know the opposing moral force
[02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:43.600]  whether we call it secession decentralization and and I would argue
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:46.760]  as Hans Hoppe and others have pointed out this really should get down to the
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:51.560]  individual level we should be able to succeed as individuals Alex like you I
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:55.680]  never agree I never signed the US Constitution this of course was a point
[02:44:55.680 --> 02:45:01.040]  that that was under Spooner made in the middle of the 19th century we didn't
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:04.560]  we didn't agree to this this is something that's imposed on us so the
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:08.280]  government imposes its view on us whether they call it the Constitution or
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:12.640]  and of course as Ron Paul pointed out in his speech the Constitution has failed
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:17.360]  the Constitution did not work so we need we need to concentrate more on what's
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:20.400]  wrong with the government we can't count on the government to save us we can't
[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:24.720]  use these government documents thinking that they're going to they're going to
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:28.080]  save us from the government the government uses them against us now I
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:31.080]  would agree with you that the declaration of independence which is a
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:37.080]  declaration of secession is maybe a something we can very much count on
[02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:43.720]  rhetorically and to it and its principles but you know we always have to
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:48.480]  remember too when Ron Paul has pointed this out just recently America we think
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:52.280]  of the current American system was founded by this secession of the 13
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:56.240]  colonies which were 13 little independent countries and too bad that
[02:45:56.240 --> 02:46:00.160]  well too bad we don't still have that system but anyway the 13 independent
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:04.520]  colonies seceded from Britain this is a war of secession it was not a war of
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:08.760]  conquest the typical war everything of the kinds of wars the US wages so was a
[02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:12.960]  war of conquest the war that the Americans wage was to get out from
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:16.880]  under Britain they didn't want to invade London and try to rule Scotland or
[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:21.320]  Wales or whatever they just wanted nothing to do with England in terms of
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:26.280]  political control so you know that's the way many of us feel about Washington DC
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:32.120]  we feel it about for that matter our own state capitals maybe even our local
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:36.120]  towns they're all becoming tyrannical government at all levels is becoming
[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:39.800]  more tyrannical by the day maybe that'll help us understand that government is
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:43.520]  not the answer the other hand Jefferson pointed out that competitive
[02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:47.520]  sovereignty's could help restrain government and of course it was the
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:51.160]  abolition of the states as competitive sovereignty's for the federal government
[02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:57.440]  and the abolition of entities within the states also help the centralization
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:47:02.840]  process Jefferson Jefferson said that that people who had his sorts of
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:07.880]  political views stood with the states against the general government stood
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:14.400]  with the towns against the states stood with the wards against the towns stood
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:20.080]  with the individual against everything so that's the way to think of it we want
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:24.920]  more decentralization more power downwards we don't want centralization
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:27.520]  we don't let alone of course we don't want world government or anything like
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:32.560]  it we don't want a huge conglomerated nation state like the US which is too
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:37.600]  big to be free yes sir 130 million people under one gigantic government and
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:40.520]  think you're gonna have freedom you don't have freedom you have tyranny
[02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:44.320]  which of course is what we've got absolutely who rockwell's our guest I'm
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:47.560]  sure you know because you we actually have an article off blue rockwell.com
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:51.040]  Glenn Beck has told his listeners and I want to get into a bashing thing with
[02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:56.800]  him it may just be pure you know fear well well I mean my point is he's saying
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:00.480]  don't you dare sign that you'll be a traitor I have his quote the video here
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:04.040]  and then we get emails I know you're getting them we've got an example right
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:08.720]  here anti-succession threat where it's like I strongly suggest you do not
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:11.560]  sign this petition or align yourself with any group that would place your
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:15.960]  allegiance to the country in question how about our country got taken over by
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:20.120]  globalist who bragged that they've conquered America on CNBC and the
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:24.480]  Associated Press banking cartels that literally take my money and give it to
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:28.760]  them while they debase the rest of the money and then they're saying it's racist
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:32.800]  the new civil war is about to begin Obama will be the new Lincoln they've been
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:36.360]  getting ready for this forever I mean these people are truly sick they have
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:41.720]  petition signed to arrest us and to have federal militias come in and retake
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:45.720]  the states with volunteer Democrats who want to run around in little Soviet
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:51.200]  uniforms they're dreaming of some Soviet I mean these people are sick Alex I
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:54.760]  can remember when Glenn Beck said that romp all supporters were potential
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:59.440]  terrorists should all be investigated by the army and potentially in the
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:07.120]  arrested by the army what is the concept of treason I mean that
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:11.280]  actually would argue that the government owns us that we you know even though
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:15.760]  they do nothing for us they of course do plenty to us that they own us and we're
[02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:19.240]  not allowed to get out from under them and of course this is you know this is
[02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:23.560]  like the government in the American past has killed people for wanting to get
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:27.720]  out from under it so we can't we you know we also have to be aware that that
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:32.280]  they are violence incorporated on the other hand we don't need violence we
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:36.040]  have the ideas the right ideas on our side the ideas of freedom is wrong
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:42.400]  determination who is Barack Obama or Mitt Romney or Mitt Romney's assistant
[02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:47.520]  Glenn Beck to tell the average American family that the feds in Washington should
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:50.840]  be running them as should be supervising them as to how they raise their
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:54.760]  children should be supervising their home supervising their neighborhood
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:50:00.680]  supervising their business I mean that's just because pure tyranny and again we
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:04.960]  need a much smaller country would be a great thing to break up the US just like
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:09.480]  it be a great thing to break up the European Union if we look back to the
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:14.440]  wonderful example of Germany on top of points out in free a treaty of West
[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:18.880]  failure days there were 700 little countries that made up Germany they all
[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:22.800]  were Germans they were culturally and linguistically Germans but they had they
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:28.240]  had a tiny government it created competition between those and firewalls
[02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:32.280]  to tyranny no this is this is the way it's supposed to be this was the way it
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:36.760]  was in the Middle Ages when it when you have tiny tiny countries so we've had
[02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:42.080]  this terrible tendency by politicians to try to conglomerate together the better
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:46.040]  to rip us off the better to rule us the better to put their boot on our neck
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:49.920]  that's what they live for they love and of course the better to wage wars the
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:53.560]  better to take all our money through taxation better to control every aspect
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:57.440]  of your rock wall stay there stay there I want to talk about how we take take the

[02:53:59.120 --> 02:54:11.760]  got
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:16.400]  again we have a global corporate banking cartel that's gotten our government
[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:20.200]  to sign on to all of its fraud they've got a giant horde of people who don't even
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:24.160]  know how to tie their shoelaces we're totally domesticated calling for anybody
[02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:30.000]  who works his head in total class warfare envy we've seen this happen hundreds
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:34.240]  of times the last thousand years or so we are in deep trouble this country has
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:38.880]  cancer all I say is we can debate smaller units later the states are what
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:42.240]  could deliver that of the Constitution we got a kick the globalist out of
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:45.960]  Washington and then reconstitute the republic if that's what the states chose
[02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:51.400]  all I know is I want the foreign occupying force out and Lou I don't want
[02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:54.400]  to just move around trying to people elect Congress I think it's now time to
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:58.200]  go to the states and say hey you want to secede or you want to develop a plan to
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:02.080]  have a new Declaration of Independence to kick the globalist out because the
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:04.400]  globalist I know you've seen this in the news they're bragging they've
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:09.440]  conquered our country and I think that's pretty important that all these big
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:13.960]  mega banks and you know CNBC and the Associated Press tell us we're now run
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:17.000]  by foreign banks but that's a good thing they know best yes global
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:21.440]  governments here but the ADL says you're a terrorist if you say there's a world
[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:25.560]  government you know it's time to just be able to go all the way here what's your
[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:30.120]  take on that well I think it is you know I think our ideas are winning this is
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:34.640]  what what bothers the opposition and I think it's wonderful that if a state
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:40.200]  wants to for example seek to use gold and silver as money internally or all
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:44.080]  those other kinds of things get rid of federal regulations nullify federal
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:50.480]  regulations I remember the great moment when South Carolina to oppose that the
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:54.600]  rotten tariffs of Andrew Jackson that this had nothing to do with slavery by
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:59.320]  the way despite the propaganda they said if you try to raise taxes to the
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:02.800]  extent you're going to destroy us you try to do that we're not going to go
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:06.920]  along and if any federal officials come into our state to try to enforce this
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:11.320]  taxation we're going to arrest them that was that was the the first great
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:16.200]  nullification and as Jefferson Tom Woods is a great book on nullification if
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:19.680]  you're interested in this topic everybody take a look at Tom's book and the
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:24.120]  power to taxes the power to destroy we are being destroyed we are being
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:29.840]  physically attacked financially by these people here's what I'm saying I know the
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:34.560]  energies there if Ron Paul steps up and says he's going to lead a movement I
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:36.840]  know they're going to for internet freedom as they put out a questionnaire
[02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:39.680]  double campaign for liberty people I've looked at it and I said internet was
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:43.600]  important so he's going with what this constituents of liberty and push for but
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:47.360]  I think it's important to codify and go look this this this nullification is
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:50.760]  going to happen campaign for liberty's got to get out front Lou Rockwell's got
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:55.360]  to get out front you've been out front but say hey you know this isn't what you
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:00.480]  say a secession is this is reconstituting the republic kicking the
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:04.040]  globalist cow kicking the Federal Reserve out I think we can route these
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:08.800]  people I'm telling you there's a real revolutionary fervor there Lou and I
[02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:12.520]  think it's time to launch well Alex we've got the truth on our side and the
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:16.560]  truth is that we all have the right to be free we're all born free until
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:20.400]  governments of course try to make us unfree this again as you pointed out
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:26.480]  this is a very ancient battle between freedom and and the state so secession
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:31.120]  is part of it self-determination we have the right to that they don't have the
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:35.040]  right to control us against our will and we have the right ideas on our side
[02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:38.880]  and we have to remember you know even though the government is a is aggression
[02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:43.760]  concentrated aggression the freedom movement is non-aggression so we're
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:49.320]  about voluntary association sure voluntary action and spreading the
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:53.760]  ideas and more and more people are on our side more and more young sure what
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:56.800]  I'm sure what's escalating this movement he's going to be leading this
[02:57:56.800 --> 02:58:00.440]  movement good good he is leading it but he's going to continue to lead it well
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:04.600]  I know you talked to him quite often and got him on the show last week and I'm
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:08.520]  glad that he's also taken over campaign for liberty and is reaffirming
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:13.840]  everything in there and can you do five more minutes with us and overdrive sure
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:16.560]  okay I want to look just have you make some final points I know I'm running
[02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:19.840]  over you it's just we need to do this now and all I'm saying is the
[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:25.720]  nullification movements out there the the secession movements out there but
[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:28.240]  they're gonna go and point at hillbillies that are announcing themselves
[02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:31.960]  president of Texas or whatever we need to have Ron Paul out front saying no
[02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:35.920]  we're kicking the globalist out we're restoring the Republic from the states
[02:58:35.920 --> 02:59:05.040]  on up the states that made the federal government
