[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  It's Tuesday, April 12th. The year is 2022. I'm Alex Jones, your host. I'll be co-hosting
[00:06.240 --> 00:11.640]  you with Owen Schreuer today. We have some of the biggest developments yet in the ongoing
[00:11.640 --> 00:17.000]  proxy war between NATO and Russia in Ukraine coming up in the next segment. The first thing
[00:17.000 --> 00:23.280]  I want to break down is this. The evaporating borders, the disintegration of the dollar,
[00:23.280 --> 00:30.080]  the attack on the family, the breakdown in basic government services, the globalist move
[00:30.080 --> 00:36.320]  to cut back the size of police forces and turn them into political operatives and commasars
[00:36.320 --> 00:41.880]  is being directed worldwide, not just nationwide. That's why you see the same policies in New
[00:41.880 --> 00:48.120]  York as you see in California, the same policies you see in places like Milwaukee that you
[00:48.120 --> 00:56.760]  see in Broward County, Florida. They are carrying out a program of societal collapse because
[00:56.760 --> 01:01.400]  they think that you're so stupid and they think that I'm so stupid that during their
[01:01.400 --> 01:05.800]  great reset where they're collapsing to then build back better their new world order that
[01:05.800 --> 01:11.720]  we won't blame the globalists. We won't blame the left for all the policies that destroy
[01:11.720 --> 01:16.840]  civilizations. But if we are able to expose them and the fact that they're the ones bragging
[01:16.840 --> 01:21.160]  that they're actually doing this to break down the infrastructure for a post-industrial
[01:21.160 --> 01:26.800]  world where almost everyone is either depopulated or lives like serfs without even running water
[01:26.800 --> 01:35.080]  or electricity and the elites live in their own compounds and their own mini cities basically
[01:35.080 --> 01:42.240]  like the movie Elysium but here on the earth or like the books The Hunger Games, that is
[01:42.240 --> 01:47.160]  the globalist program and all over the United States and all over Europe there are now giant
[01:47.160 --> 01:54.320]  no-go zones. We're up to a third of Paris or large areas of Brussels, large areas of
[01:54.320 --> 01:58.680]  London you can't even go into if you are a Christian or if you're white, if you're not
[01:58.680 --> 02:02.560]  a Muslim or if you're not part of one of the criminal gangs. It's just a fact that we have
[02:02.560 --> 02:08.120]  brought in all these groups that always take over and only allow their group to be wherever
[02:08.120 --> 02:13.920]  they are. They are not open society like we are so when George Soros calls his organization
[02:13.920 --> 02:20.440]  the open society it's beyond critical to understand that that is a play on words it's a sick
[02:20.440 --> 02:25.320]  joke because he's creating societies that aren't open. And now we see in many areas
[02:25.320 --> 02:31.560]  the U.S. mail delivery is being suspended or terminated areas because the crime is so
[02:31.560 --> 02:36.520]  high and things are so lawless and we see all the snatching grabs going on and the car
[02:36.520 --> 02:42.320]  jacking is exploding and the news most of the time won't even report on it now when it happens
[02:42.320 --> 02:47.400]  and they won't report on the race of who is committing the crime. Because again they
[02:47.400 --> 02:51.840]  don't want people to be held accountable and they want to sell this paradigm that all
[02:51.840 --> 02:57.600]  crime comes from white people and that is white bureaucrats selling that because they
[02:57.600 --> 03:01.880]  are using third world populations to politically and culturally conquer the West. They don't
[03:01.880 --> 03:07.440]  want anybody to organize and say no to it before it's too late. So here is a short clip
[03:07.440 --> 03:11.800]  from the local news in Santa Monica where again they are having to suspend mail deliveries
[03:11.800 --> 03:17.920]  because of the harassment, the assaults, the robbery. And as you see this clip and hear
[03:17.920 --> 03:23.760]  this clip remember McCron just came out in France last week where people were being robbed
[03:23.760 --> 03:30.040]  and killed and got offending himself from robbers in his house and shot him that defending
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.880]  yourself is a crime. Under the left they get security guards, they get bodyguards but you
[03:35.880 --> 03:41.200]  are disarmed and they take the police away except for only having some police for political
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.640]  enforcement. So here is the clip and we will be right back on the other side of the huge
[03:45.640 --> 03:53.200]  Russia Ukraine proxy war developments, infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. Good morning Tony and
[03:53.200 --> 03:59.440]  Oroxy yes it's a definitely concerning situation here on the 1300 block of 14th street in Santa
[03:59.440 --> 04:04.680]  Monica where residents say they have suspended mail service because of the fact that their
[04:04.680 --> 04:09.720]  mail carriers have been attacked or threatened or assaulted and they say this has been going
[04:09.720 --> 04:15.320]  on for a few weeks now even one resident saying they saw mail strewn about the street because
[04:15.320 --> 04:22.080]  a man kicked over the cart and basically threatened the mail carrier with a golf club or some
[04:22.080 --> 04:28.160]  type of bat. So because of all this the postal service here in Santa Monica sent a letter
[04:28.160 --> 04:34.280]  on April 7th last week saying that the mail service will be suspended for this area about
[04:34.280 --> 04:39.320]  200 families will be impacted because of this because it's just not safe for their letter
[04:39.320 --> 04:44.840]  carriers to be out here delivering the mail. Now of course residents are concerned about
[04:44.840 --> 04:49.760]  this and wondering why they can't just apprehend the person involved in all this making the
[04:49.760 --> 04:55.600]  threats obviously the postal service according to this letter that they issued to the residents
[04:55.600 --> 05:00.440]  say that this isn't a decision they made lightly but they cannot.
[05:00.440 --> 05:05.280]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse. I've been on the air
[05:05.280 --> 05:10.640]  a couple of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show. I wanted
[05:10.640 --> 05:14.800]  to hire camera people I wanted to make films I wanted to really challenge the globalist
[05:14.800 --> 05:20.040]  and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one mass murderers agreed gun control works
[05:20.040 --> 05:24.480]  that helped us finance hiring the first three members of my crew. That's their oldest design
[05:24.480 --> 05:29.080]  and we're still selling. We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be
[05:29.080 --> 05:33.960]  limited editions because whatever stock we've got in that's it we're selling everything
[05:33.960 --> 05:38.800]  out to find the operation to get rid of inventory. We'll still have some t-shirts in the future
[05:38.800 --> 05:42.800]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if you want to get any of these historic
[05:42.800 --> 05:49.840]  shirts this is your last chance I almost forgot we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[05:49.840 --> 05:55.760]  Every ball cap every flag every hoodie every long sleeve every t-shirt regular shirts designer
[05:55.760 --> 06:06.680]  shirts they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com and it's time for humanity to stand up in
[06:06.680 --> 06:10.720]  the info war and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this but you want
[06:10.720 --> 06:19.720]  to fight you better believe you got one. From the front lines of the information war it's
[06:19.720 --> 06:39.920]  Alex Jones.
[06:39.920 --> 06:46.600]  It's Tuesday April 12th 2022 and there's an extremely critical article on the front
[06:46.600 --> 06:54.920]  page of info wars.com written by Paul Joseph Watson. It links through to the top publication
[06:54.920 --> 07:00.120]  in France and has the excerpts and the video of one of the most respected journalists in
[07:00.120 --> 07:07.080]  the nation reporting on the fact that quote Americans are in charge of the war says French
[07:07.080 --> 07:14.000]  journalist who returned home from Ukraine. Now why is this important? Well as I told
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.680]  you before this even started in February officially that the United States and NATO had thousands
[07:20.680 --> 07:27.920]  of US special forces British SAS and others in the country since before 2014 when the
[07:27.920 --> 07:35.080]  State Department overthrew the elected government George Soros brags about this on CNN they
[07:35.080 --> 07:41.720]  have policy reports put out by the State Department this is not even hidden it's an absolute fact
[07:41.720 --> 07:51.800]  but the public is totally and completely not just naive but illiterate when it comes to
[07:51.800 --> 07:56.200]  geopolitics and the military and the things that are happening. But the reason this is
[07:56.200 --> 08:02.040]  a big deal is that Americans aren't even hiding it anymore the American troops that they are
[08:02.040 --> 08:09.360]  fully in charge of running the brigades recruiting the people vetting who was in it and then
[08:09.360 --> 08:14.520]  training them on the anti-tank antiaircraft the switchblade drones and so much more and
[08:14.520 --> 08:21.840]  that then US assets in space are helping direct at all this is a direct war with the Russians
[08:21.840 --> 08:30.440]  and I'll say it again the West started this war the West started this proxy war and that
[08:30.440 --> 08:34.520]  doesn't mean that I support what Vladimir Putin is doing but I certainly do not support
[08:34.520 --> 08:39.840]  what George Soros and the international war criminals have done starting this proxy war
[08:39.840 --> 08:43.920]  that they're now blaming on the entire world economic collapse which was set up by the
[08:43.920 --> 08:49.000]  central banks devaluing currencies and the two year lock down around the world but here's
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.920]  the article just remember you get this tomorrow's news today we're telling you this years ago
[08:54.920 --> 09:01.000]  and warning in October that war was coming in February that it would then probably expand
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.880]  massively and that the Chinese will also go into Taiwan that's the intel I have they haven't
[09:04.880 --> 09:08.440]  done it yet I think they're watching to see what happens to the Russians but here it is
[09:08.440 --> 09:14.600]  Americans are in charge of the war says French journalist who returned from Ukraine a French
[09:14.600 --> 09:21.200]  journalist who returned from Ukraine after arriving with volunteer fighters told broadcaster
[09:21.200 --> 09:27.880]  see news that Americans are directly in charge of the war on the ground the assertion was
[09:27.880 --> 09:37.800]  made by Le Figaro senior international correspondent George Malbront it continues Malbront said
[09:37.800 --> 09:42.360]  he had accompanied French volunteer fighters two of whom had previously fought against
[09:42.360 --> 09:49.440]  ISIS I had the surprise and so did they to discover to be able to enter the Ukrainian
[09:49.440 --> 09:55.960]  army well it's the Americans who are in charge he said the videos posted right there on m4s.com
[09:55.960 --> 10:01.480]  we can watch it adding that he and the volunteers almost got quote arrested by the Americans
[10:01.480 --> 10:05.840]  who asserted they were in charge the journalist then revealed that they were forced to sign
[10:05.840 --> 10:11.240]  a contract until the end of the war and who is in charge it's the Americans I saw them
[10:11.240 --> 10:16.520]  on eyes he said adding I thought I was with the international brigades and I found myself
[10:16.520 --> 10:21.240]  facing the Pentagon the journalist went on to say he also mentioned American is providing
[10:21.240 --> 10:26.080]  Ukraine switchblade suicide drones something highlighted by the Defense Secretary Lloyd
[10:26.080 --> 10:30.440]  Austin a tweet revealed Ukrainian soldiers were being trained to use the devices in Biloxi
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.880]  Mississippi you also have the photo of the Pentagon tweet on m4s.com citing a French
[10:34.880 --> 10:40.080]  intelligence source he also tweeted that British SAS units have been present in Ukraine since
[10:40.080 --> 10:47.200]  the beginning of the war as did the American Delta Force Russia is apparently well aware
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.680]  of the secret war being waged in Ukraine by foreign commandos and has been in the region
[10:51.680 --> 11:00.760]  since February and it just goes on from there ladies and gentlemen Vladimir Putin knew when
[11:00.760 --> 11:08.200]  he went in to Ukraine he was facing the best special forces of the Western world he knew
[11:08.200 --> 11:15.880]  he was throwing a very very small military comparatively against them and you just have
[11:15.880 --> 11:24.480]  to pull back and think that this is really very very reckless behavior and the only thing
[11:24.480 --> 11:27.800]  more reckless is George Soros the globalist starting this whole damn thing and it makes
[11:27.800 --> 11:34.120]  me extremely angry and pissed off we have evil running our governments we know it they
[11:34.120 --> 11:37.880]  run the policies the transgenderism and the children the pedophilia and the grooming and
[11:37.880 --> 11:41.560]  the open borders and the evaluation of currencies and the poison fluoride in the water and the
[11:41.560 --> 11:48.120]  GMO deadly shots and everything's happening it is a curse these are not Americans these
[11:48.120 --> 11:51.640]  are not Brits these are not French these are not Europeans that are running this new world
[11:51.640 --> 11:58.000]  order these are evil corrupt globalist forces and Paul Joseph Watson's article goes on to
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.440]  show the polls that upwards of 80% of Americans and Europeans and Brits it's about the same
[12:03.440 --> 12:10.680]  number 75 85% they average some of them as high as 90% polls do not want any aid or any
[12:10.680 --> 12:17.360]  direct involvement of the West against Russia this is on their doorstep is where Russia started
[12:17.360 --> 12:21.360]  we should not be getting involved in these affairs but instead the people around our
[12:21.360 --> 12:27.880]  country have actually started the whole damn thing and that's where we are ladies and gentlemen
[12:27.880 --> 12:33.920]  and that's what we witness with the US sending in tens of billions of dollars a month now
[12:33.920 --> 12:38.880]  that's the real number into this giant expanding proxy war that the Russians just threatened
[12:38.880 --> 12:45.960]  yesterday may lead and will probably lead if it continues to expand into a direct military
[12:45.960 --> 12:51.520]  confrontation with the West and now NATO and the US are shipping armored vehicles and tanks
[12:51.520 --> 12:59.600]  and other devices of war directly into the combat zone and this is so dangerous this
[12:59.600 --> 13:05.760]  is so so so evil and they're controlling the Ukrainian border the US government is but
[13:05.760 --> 13:12.240]  not our southern border as Biden prepares to completely erase it entirely so remember
[13:12.240 --> 13:15.960]  that and think about while we're being imploded and while service men and women are homeless
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.320]  on the street while people die of fentanyl every five minutes things are for men under
[13:19.320 --> 13:23.920]  so actually while the whole society collapses and his test scores go to almost zero in many
[13:23.920 --> 13:28.680]  school districts they have some sort of districts where no one can pass the test as all of that
[13:28.680 --> 13:33.600]  happens we're told we've got to follow this TV actor as a lens you do everything he says
[13:33.600 --> 13:38.960]  so we're in deep deep deep trouble you see what you want about Vladimir Putin he's been
[13:38.960 --> 13:42.920]  trying to modernize Russia he's been trying to move him on the organic farming he's been
[13:42.920 --> 13:48.760]  promoting the family and he's been banding the leftist Disney style grooming garbage
[13:48.760 --> 13:54.400]  and so on that front he is better than the global elites we have here that are in control
[13:54.400 --> 13:58.840]  but I'm not on Russia side I'm not on America side I own the side of truth and the side
[13:58.840 --> 14:03.440]  of God and the side of his son and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and I hope everyone
[14:03.440 --> 14:10.320]  will pray for world peace and pray for Americans to wake up and be America first when it comes
[14:10.320 --> 14:14.840]  to defending our nation and our borders and our sovereignty because I am an American and
[14:14.840 --> 14:18.560]  I am loyal and I do love this country and that means I actually love the interest of
[14:18.560 --> 14:26.200]  this nation and also above that the interest of God and what God dictates God family country

[20:39.640 --> 20:49.080]  globalist leaders installed by the world economic forum from europe to the united states from
[20:49.080 --> 20:58.120]  canada to new zealand are openly announcing the plan for a new planetary lockdown sometime
[20:58.120 --> 21:03.840]  in the next six to eight months the head of the health service in canada came out and
[21:03.840 --> 21:09.920]  said it two weeks ago german officials said it last week australian officials said it
[21:09.920 --> 21:17.840]  this week they are all reading off of the w e f s playbook the world economic forum
[21:17.840 --> 21:22.360]  they are collapsing the world economy to get the public into greater debt to force everyone
[21:22.360 --> 21:29.640]  to accept the cashless society control grid last night tucker carlson was completely over
[21:29.640 --> 21:35.200]  the target when he pointed out that the massive lockdowns in china just one in shanghai has
[21:35.200 --> 21:41.160]  33 plus million people under total lockdown in nightmare dystopic images right out of
[21:41.160 --> 21:46.600]  a zombie apocalypse of tens of millions locked up thousands of vans taking people away to
[21:46.600 --> 21:51.440]  emergency centers who aren't even sick images of thousands of cats and dogs in bags being
[21:51.440 --> 21:55.800]  taken off to be exterminated and what are they telling you all mammals are evil all
[21:55.800 --> 22:01.600]  mammals are bad all birds are bad because they can carry the corona virus the most common
[22:01.600 --> 22:08.440]  virus in the world by designating the corona virus evil and with fake pcr test they list
[22:08.440 --> 22:14.720]  all life as evil and is garbage that the global government can target that is phase two of
[22:14.720 --> 22:20.360]  their plan to list all life on planet earth as evil that they regulate control to make
[22:20.360 --> 22:26.520]  living itself a crime that's why they first banned one fourth of earth's life force on
[22:26.520 --> 22:31.840]  the carbon cycle carbon dioxide that then produces the oxygen in plants and you have
[22:31.840 --> 22:37.560]  the carbon cycle of water sun shine and the two key gases that's why I say the globals
[22:37.560 --> 22:41.440]  behave like aliens that are terraforming the planet everything they're doing is actually
[22:41.440 --> 22:46.080]  attacking the planet and destroying its atmosphere in the name of saving it and targeting all
[22:46.080 --> 22:51.960]  basic life forms on earth and undermining the systems of earth's regenerative control
[22:51.960 --> 22:57.120]  here is part of the powerful tucker carlson opening monologue is posted on info wars

[23:20.760 --> 23:28.080]  or not all the red flags and all the indicators point towards that regardless these people
[23:28.080 --> 23:32.720]  are anti-human and must be opposed i'm alex jones the tip of the spear this broadcast
[23:32.720 --> 23:35.920]  of the tip of the spear and you listening to the tip of the spear and we salute tucker
[23:35.920 --> 23:41.280]  carlson and others because if we don't expose the WEF's global plan to collapse the world
[23:41.280 --> 23:46.440]  economy for their depopulation goal of 2030 we have no hope but if we have a massive weight
[23:46.440 --> 23:51.440]  getting an epiphany to this we can and we will win now tucker carlson coming up and
[23:51.440 --> 23:57.040]  then oh and shroyer good evening and welcome to tucker carlson's happy monday the first
[23:57.040 --> 24:01.560]  mass quarantine and human history began in the central chinese city of wuhan that was
[24:01.560 --> 24:07.120]  back in the beginning of 2020 within days pictures and videos what was happening there
[24:07.120 --> 24:12.120]  began to appear on english language social media and at the time the images were shocking
[24:12.120 --> 24:17.920]  to everyone in the west the communist party of china had effectively imprisoned 11 million
[24:17.920 --> 24:23.320]  people simultaneously the citizens of wuhan were confined by government order to their
[24:23.320 --> 24:28.360]  apartments and those who tried to leave sometimes found themselves welded inside some of them
[24:28.360 --> 24:33.640]  starved to death authorities in hazmat suits dragged screaming citizens into vans and then
[24:33.640 --> 24:38.720]  drove them to internment camps watching this you could barely believe it china seemed to
[24:38.720 --> 24:44.840]  have gone insane moving from authoritarian to dystopian in a single day so this was the
[24:44.840 --> 24:49.480]  world's introduction to covid 19 a virus we later learned the chinese government itself
[24:49.480 --> 24:55.360]  helped create looking back it all seems like a bad dream covid panic has now ended the
[24:55.360 --> 25:00.320]  virus no longer constitutes a public health crisis in this or any other country and it's
[25:00.320 --> 25:05.300]  clear in retrospect that government lockdowns whatever their motives in the end hurt far
[25:05.300 --> 25:10.800]  more people than covid itself did the much touted vaccines meanwhile provided nowhere
[25:10.800 --> 25:15.080]  near the protection the drug companies had promised and at the same time came with significant
[25:15.080 --> 25:21.000]  risks that even now have not been openly discussed so at this point knowing all this as everybody
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.640]  does countries all over the world are lifting their coronavirus restrictions next will come
[25:25.640 --> 25:31.000]  the apologies and then in the free countries at least lawsuits and criminal charges against
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.640]  the people who did this so we're just beginning to reckon with the nightmare that all of us
[25:35.640 --> 25:41.280]  have lived through and it's impossible to imagine living through it again but in china
[25:41.280 --> 25:46.240]  they are living through it again the government of china has just completely shut down the
[25:46.240 --> 25:51.160]  city of shanghai shanghai is the biggest city in the country it's one of the largest cities
[25:51.160 --> 25:57.160]  in the world more than 25 million people live in shanghai and the lockdown there is by all
[25:57.160 --> 26:02.240]  accounts more brutal and more far reaching anything we saw in wuhan two years ago watch
[26:02.240 --> 26:09.120]  well if you think wuhan 2020 was bad welcome to shanghai 2022 this has been like no other
[26:09.120 --> 26:14.560]  lockdown and it's in the country's cosmopolitan and most affluent financial hub of all places
[26:14.560 --> 26:19.200]  at this door behind me this is my exit to the outside alleyway in late last night i heard
[26:19.200 --> 26:24.640]  them taping up my door along with the doors of my neighbors they're placing a paper seal
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.480]  so as to keep it closed some buildings with positive cases inside well they're locked
[26:29.480 --> 26:36.080]  shut from the outside they're using bicycle locks and padlocks just to keep people in
[26:36.080 --> 26:42.440]  so for once c9 is not exaggerating you have 25 million people locked inside their homes
[26:42.440 --> 26:48.440]  you have the largest prison camp in human history anyone who tests positive for covid is shoved
[26:48.440 --> 26:59.440]  into a van and then taken to a quarantine camp watch it happen to this child
[26:59.440 --> 27:18.440]  so
[27:18.440 --> 27:23.480]  so where those vans going well here are pictures of a quarantine camp in china the child you
[27:23.480 --> 27:29.000]  just saw may be there now many thousands of chinese citizens are at this camp mattresses
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.760]  are strewn on the floor of cells there's no water there's just one shared toilet just
[27:33.760 --> 27:38.720]  days ago the inmates you see here we're living ordinary lives in their own homes now they're
[27:38.720 --> 27:44.080]  in prison what happened to the lives they left behind what happened to the dogs and
[27:44.080 --> 27:50.920]  cats they left at home well chances are chinese police beat those dogs and cats to death on
[27:50.920 --> 27:56.560]  the street that's happening tonight all over shanghai a mass slaughter of pets and we hesitate
[27:56.560 --> 28:00.760]  even to show this to you it's too horrible but it's also real and we thought you should
[28:00.760 --> 28:09.680]  know the covid prevention worker was caught on camera bashing to death a pet corgi apparently
[28:09.680 --> 28:15.280]  this happened after the pets owner had tested reportedly positive for covid 19 and taken
[28:15.280 --> 28:20.320]  away to a quarantine center was a resident the compound who filmed this video and filmed
[28:20.320 --> 28:27.600]  how this health worker used a shovel to strike the corgi three times before the pet dog died
[28:27.600 --> 28:33.960]  on the scene a corgi beaten to death with a shovel in china that's covid protection
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.240]  the chinese government has also confiscated some huge but unknown number of house cats
[28:38.240 --> 28:46.720]  from people's homes thrown them in bags and left them on sidewalks to be killed all right
[28:46.720 --> 28:50.560]  folks we don't want to go the way of china and we know the world economic forum and the
[28:50.560 --> 28:56.720]  democrat operators want us to go the way of china we'll have more from alex jones on the
[28:56.720 --> 29:03.440]  other side it's about 25 years ago that i wanted to expand in for worse i've been on

[30:07.840 --> 30:16.640]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and man

[32:19.680 --> 32:25.200]  i know that the first coin is already selling on ebay and other places for three times what we sold
[32:25.200 --> 32:32.000]  it we need to sell all 10 000 of these very very quickly and i appreciate listeners getting over
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.480]  half of them now i'd like to move them out very quickly i think they will sell out probably in
[32:36.480 --> 32:43.040]  five or six more days and without the last coin sale we would not be operating at the same capacity
[32:43.040 --> 32:47.200]  we've had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem so it was a limited edition collectible
[32:47.200 --> 32:50.800]  tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom and it's needed for our infrastructure
[32:50.800 --> 32:56.960]  and building new systems so please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at
[32:56.960 --> 33:18.400]  1776 coin.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[33:18.400 --> 33:27.360]  welcome back to the live edition of the alex jones show on shroy is about to take over but i just
[33:27.360 --> 33:39.120]  wanted to very calmly say this again this operation has been the first and the loudest voice exposing
[33:39.120 --> 33:45.280]  the plan for global lockdowns forced inoculations because we were aware of operation lockstep
[33:45.280 --> 33:49.920]  and other globalist documents but even before that we were aware of this information from our
[33:49.920 --> 33:56.160]  pentagon sources not just general stubble mind or dr rima labo but others that had treated heads
[33:56.160 --> 34:02.080]  of state and where they talked about this virus release fear plan to bring in the casual society
[34:02.080 --> 34:07.360]  for more than 30 years so the fact is they only put a pause on this in some areas because political
[34:07.360 --> 34:11.440]  opposition was rising and they didn't want the resistance to coalesce to a point where we took
[34:11.440 --> 34:16.720]  over our governments so they push push push push push when they wake us up they back off and then
[34:16.720 --> 34:21.040]  we go back to sleep and they push again and you see you've been conditioned by the last attack
[34:21.040 --> 34:26.240]  so you don't get as upset the second time that's why we've got to stay upset focused informed and
[34:26.240 --> 34:32.240]  vocal exposing the global biomedical regime is key everything you see happening in china and those
[34:32.240 --> 34:37.520]  horrors is coming here and that's why keeping info awards on the air is more important than ever
[34:37.520 --> 34:41.680]  we were the first to be censored at a mass scale we were censored at the highest levels because they
[34:41.680 --> 34:47.440]  know we have the intel to defeat their new world order so please keep us on air and share the
[34:47.440 --> 34:53.200]  live feeds at info wars dot com or chess show and of course bandod video but whatever you do
[34:53.760 --> 34:57.920]  pray for this operation because without that we're going nowhere with that we are unstoppable
[34:58.560 --> 35:03.440]  and support the local ambit of affiliates tv affiliate and so many others whatever you do
[35:03.440 --> 35:08.160]  continue to realize god is in control and the goblos are trying to play god but they will be
[35:08.160 --> 35:15.120]  defeated and their god their false god satan will be punished all right back to owens roe and the
[35:15.120 --> 35:22.320]  live transmission all right thank you alex and we are now live inside the info wars world headquarters
[35:22.320 --> 35:29.440]  here in austin texas owens roe are with you for the remainder of the alex jones show we do have
[35:29.440 --> 35:39.600]  great guests coming up today we've got an individual that was injured by a vaccine the covid vaccine
[35:39.600 --> 35:47.040]  sadly had to have a leg amputated and the doctor even said yeah the vaccine did this to you so
[35:47.040 --> 35:51.760]  the media won't touch that story so we'll make sure that that news gets out very sad situation
[35:51.760 --> 36:00.080]  more vaccine injuries the bought and paid for by big pharma news corporations don't want you to hear
[36:00.080 --> 36:05.760]  about because phyzer sponsors their shows and that's how they make their millions of dollars
[36:06.400 --> 36:12.720]  we don't do that here we're not corrupt scum here like corporate news is for the most part
[36:12.720 --> 36:22.720]  and we also have one of the inventors of the 3d gun concept and model
[36:23.840 --> 36:27.440]  cody wilson is going to be in studio with us as well
[36:29.600 --> 36:35.520]  both of those guests are in the third hour of today's alex jones show and then alex stein
[36:35.520 --> 36:48.640]  who is just on fire lately and really has i would say created a new genre of content
[36:48.640 --> 36:56.400]  and that's going to city council citizen communication forums public speaking forums
[36:56.400 --> 37:07.760]  and and using that public speaking time to bring real world issues to the fore but with the slant
[37:07.760 --> 37:17.920]  of parody or satire which would be like so so it'd be like we're not there yet we may actually
[37:17.920 --> 37:22.880]  be there now we just don't know it yet because these things take time to pull to pull off but it'd
[37:22.880 --> 37:29.680]  be like if somebody i mean let's just say i decided i'm gonna i'm gonna shave my beard and start wearing
[37:29.680 --> 37:35.840]  a uh you know women's clothes or something and play women's golf just just to show that some
[37:35.840 --> 37:41.040]  hack golfer can go play women's golf and and be and be the best on the tour now maybe that's a bad
[37:41.040 --> 37:47.600]  example i'm just saying that'd be taking a real issue which is men competing as women and then
[37:47.600 --> 37:52.480]  and then doing that as satire but but doing it actually going out on the field and doing it
[37:52.480 --> 37:58.000]  and then watching the response saying hey whoa you can't do that and so now that's what's happening is
[37:59.680 --> 38:06.560]  alex stein and another great comedian really cassidy cambell who i'm trying to get on the
[38:06.560 --> 38:13.280]  war room today later as well i'll be hosting that they're now told oh you can't come here and talk
[38:13.280 --> 38:19.440]  about trans issues you can't come to my city council and talk about trans kids well what do you mean
[38:19.440 --> 38:23.520]  that's the big issue that's what the democrats are doing in all these cities they want trans kids
[38:23.520 --> 38:28.400]  they're having gay pride parade for kids they're having trans awareness days but then you're not
[38:28.400 --> 38:35.120]  allowed to go use that as an issue to show how ridiculous it is which just means that the left
[38:35.120 --> 38:40.960]  and all these politicians know that their logic is flawed and it's all a lie it's all a hoax it's all
[38:40.960 --> 38:53.200]  political so that's all coming up and i'm looking very much forward to it and i'm i'm thinking about
[38:53.200 --> 38:59.200]  just opening up the phone lines and asking the question do you believe we're going to go into
[38:59.200 --> 39:06.560]  chinese style lockdowns like tucker carlson was predicting last night or or maybe just maybe
[39:06.560 --> 39:14.800]  not the total chinese style but is it going to be the same timetable is it going to be oh i didn't
[39:14.800 --> 39:19.920]  even know this transgender woman wins florida mini tour event set side squarely on lpga
[39:24.080 --> 39:28.560]  i'm sorry i'm focused you're telling you what's coming up but i mean it's just ridiculous
[39:29.920 --> 39:35.520]  it's just it's out it's just outrageous folks men or women i mean how much longer can we endure
[39:35.520 --> 39:43.200]  this insanity why are we being conquered by illogic and demonic activity it's just unbelievable but
[39:44.880 --> 39:48.400]  getting back to my point opening up the phone lines maybe and just taking calls through the
[39:48.400 --> 39:54.720]  whole second hour do you think we're going to go into a chinese style covid lockdown
[39:54.720 --> 40:00.160]  or is it going to be the same timetable where if you recall in 2020 you started seeing everything
[40:00.160 --> 40:07.920]  coming out of china the lockdowns the hazmat suits the the panic and then about a month or two after
[40:07.920 --> 40:13.440]  that it hit the us and so are we going to see a similar timetable here where it's okay we're
[40:13.440 --> 40:18.160]  seeing everything happening in china we're about a month maybe two removed from that coming here so
[40:18.160 --> 40:23.040]  maybe we'll open up the phone lines and ask that question in the second hour
[40:23.040 --> 40:27.920]  but you know
[40:31.120 --> 40:37.120]  as i see that story on info wars dot com about matt gates getting into it with loyte austin
[40:38.080 --> 40:43.920]  and i say good for matt gates and i tip my cap and i tip my cap to the other fighters we have in
[40:43.920 --> 40:50.880]  congress but here's what it is folks and maybe matt gates has already made this intellectual leap
[40:50.880 --> 40:55.600]  or this intellectual decision you can tell which members of congress have and which haven't
[40:58.480 --> 41:01.440]  made this intellectual decision this this intellectual leap that is
[41:02.800 --> 41:08.560]  maybe at one point in time they just figured i'm going into congress and you know i'm going to be a
[41:08.560 --> 41:12.080]  good congressman and i'm not going to be corrupt or whatever and i'm just going to get in there and
[41:12.080 --> 41:21.200]  do my thing but it's a whole new burden to bear it's a whole new intellectual philosophical
[41:22.240 --> 41:26.160]  conundrum to work your way through when you get up there and you realize
[41:27.200 --> 41:33.760]  you can't just be there is no just sitting in the congress and being a good person you either
[41:33.760 --> 41:41.040]  fight the evil or you don't so a lot of good people are out there but they never got in it to
[41:41.040 --> 41:45.440]  fight the evil they just got in it to be in it or they got in it for whatever other motive
[41:46.480 --> 41:51.120]  and and maybe they're not bad people and so now they're in there and they're like whoa i've got
[41:51.120 --> 41:58.080]  to make a decision i'm either gonna sit idly by and let evil conquer america or i'm going to make
[41:58.080 --> 42:03.280]  the intellectual philosophical decision that i'm going to fight for good no matter the cost
[42:03.280 --> 42:13.520]  and the cost is heavy believe me i've paid it i pay it every day so most people get involved and
[42:14.720 --> 42:19.360]  people who get involved in media and all this other stuff they haven't made that intellectual
[42:19.360 --> 42:25.600]  leap yet they haven't made that philosophical decision yet that wherever i stand politically
[42:25.600 --> 42:31.920]  or wherever i stand in my career or culturally or whatever i'm going up against evil now and that
[42:31.920 --> 42:40.960]  that is a whole another form of commitment but you've seen the ones in congress that have made it
[42:40.960 --> 42:47.600]  it's matt gates it's marjorie taylor green it's paul gosar it's madison cawthorn it's a small
[42:47.600 --> 42:51.680]  handful of them it's talsy gabbert i mean she's not in congress anymore but it's clear i mean
[42:51.680 --> 42:56.720]  you either stand up against this evil or you comply with it there's no in between
[42:56.720 --> 43:07.120]  over the years info wars is produced more than 200 amazing patriot americana second

[47:00.880 --> 47:06.400]  a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:06.400 --> 47:21.040]  from the front lines of the information war it's owin treuer you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:26.160 --> 47:29.840]  all right let me do a quick programming layout for you here
[47:31.440 --> 47:35.520]  as we're back here on the alex jones show owin treuer sitting in for alex today taking care
[47:35.520 --> 47:41.760]  of very important business it's just it's crazy here folks and and you know maybe i want to try
[47:41.760 --> 47:47.680]  to explain something right now but let me just do a programming layout i'm going to open calls
[47:48.400 --> 47:54.320]  when we get into the next hour i'll come back in the first segment and i'll and i'll open up the
[47:54.320 --> 48:00.640]  phone line i'll get out the number and we'll take your calls and the question is do you believe
[48:00.640 --> 48:06.880]  you believe chinese style lockdowns like we're seeing in shanghai right now i mean you want to
[48:06.880 --> 48:12.880]  talk about human oppression you want to talk about mass imprisonment of innocent civilians
[48:13.440 --> 48:18.880]  what's happening in shanghai right now it's communism for you authoritarianism for you
[48:18.880 --> 48:23.920]  medical fascism for you everything that left is supposed to be fighting against but is on
[48:23.920 --> 48:29.520]  the side of it's really quite an amazing time to be alive and the question is do you believe
[48:29.520 --> 48:35.040]  those style lockdowns that oppression that tyranny that authoritarianism is coming to america and of
[48:35.040 --> 48:41.520]  course if it does and i guess this is more of a rhetorical question because everybody knows the
[48:41.520 --> 48:50.000]  answer if such an authoritarian style of lockdown and oppression would come to america in the name
[48:50.000 --> 48:58.480]  of covet who would be promoting it who would be introducing legislation well i again i think we
[48:58.480 --> 49:04.080]  all know who that would be and would that not be the ultimate evil done upon us once again
[49:04.080 --> 49:08.960]  by the same people over and over and over again it's always the same people isn't it
[49:11.120 --> 49:19.520]  which gets back to what i was finishing up within the last segment most people who get into positions
[49:19.520 --> 49:25.600]  of power whether it be in government or big you know climb the corporate ladder or whatever
[49:25.600 --> 49:32.400]  or they don't have a philosophy or a mindset or a psychological approach
[49:33.920 --> 49:39.680]  to the activities that they're engaged in that go beyond just their own lives
[49:41.200 --> 49:47.520]  from a perspective of i'm either standing up against the evil i'm either making that choice
[49:47.520 --> 49:52.240]  i'm making that philosophical approach to this i'm standing against the evil
[49:52.240 --> 50:00.960]  or whether you're complicit with it or sit idly by or are in on it you you're all on the same
[50:00.960 --> 50:06.960]  team at that point and you might think hey well i'm not involved in it but you're sitting idly
[50:06.960 --> 50:13.360]  by well then you're going to be conquered by it that's the philosophical approach that you're
[50:13.360 --> 50:19.520]  seeing some make the commitment to now like a madison colthorn like a matt gates like a marjorie
[50:19.520 --> 50:25.360]  taylor green like a lauren bobert and you notice they're the ones that get attacked the most just
[50:25.360 --> 50:32.720]  like info wars see we we are that that's the foundation of the philosophy here at info wars
[50:34.560 --> 50:39.200]  maybe we're the best broadcasters on the planet maybe we're the worst maybe we're the most entertaining
[50:39.200 --> 50:49.840]  maybe we're the least we approach what we do here every day from the people that make this show happen
[50:49.840 --> 50:56.080]  to the people that work in our warehouse to the people that come on air our commitment our approach
[50:56.080 --> 51:01.440]  is that we stand against this evil what evil how about the evil of what you're seeing in china
[51:01.440 --> 51:04.880]  that they're probably going to bring here how about the evil of the left wanting to sexually
[51:04.880 --> 51:10.480]  pervert your children how about the evil of of teaching children how to be racists
[51:14.480 --> 51:20.080]  should we go on the evil of war the evil of fake news the evil of government corruption
[51:20.080 --> 51:26.000]  political imprisonment political persecution lies deception propaganda
[51:26.000 --> 51:34.800]  i mean for god's sakes anthony fouchy tortures puppies that's the evil we stand against that's
[51:34.800 --> 51:39.920]  our commitment there's no wavering there's no waking up in the morning and asking if that's
[51:39.920 --> 51:47.680]  the commitment we have it's it's seared into our soul like a brand on a cattle we're fighting evil
[51:47.680 --> 51:55.840]  here and slowly but surely others are starting to see it and make that commitment as well
[51:58.160 --> 52:05.600]  because it's almost like i mean is it is it like a next level genius thing or is it really
[52:05.600 --> 52:15.280]  the most basic survival instinct to realize you're on a track for extermination to realize
[52:15.280 --> 52:22.560]  that you're viewed as a slave or a term or even worse a termite a pest a cancer on this planet
[52:23.600 --> 52:31.920]  and you have been diagnosed for extermination so is that is that next level genius to realize
[52:31.920 --> 52:38.800]  that's what's going on or is that the most basic survival instinct that even a tiny cockroach has
[52:38.800 --> 52:48.000]  maybe it's both but the point is we've made that commitment you've made that commitment
[52:48.000 --> 52:53.680]  we know where we stand now it's time for others to get on board with it now it's time for others
[52:53.680 --> 53:00.800]  to understand that's what's going on and you've noticed a lot on the left have made their commitment
[53:00.800 --> 53:04.960]  to evil i mean that's what it is when you see these people coming out and doing videos like
[53:04.960 --> 53:11.680]  teachers where they say we're going to groom your kids we're going to teach your kids how
[53:11.680 --> 53:18.320]  to have gay sex we're going to sexually pervert your kids we're grooming your kids and they brag
[53:18.320 --> 53:23.520]  about it that's them committing to evil that's them saying yeah we're committed to this we wake
[53:23.520 --> 53:31.920]  up every day and we go to war against you your way of life and your children and they masquerade
[53:31.920 --> 53:39.040]  all around like oh it's about black people oh it's about gay people oh it's about the climate it's
[53:39.040 --> 53:46.400]  about the virus all of that's a lie it's about their commitment to evil and destroying life on
[53:46.400 --> 53:54.960]  this planet as we know it are they under demonic possession is it just basic Stockholm syndrome
[53:54.960 --> 54:02.880]  are these just some sort of fallen human entities that that are actually mentally retarded because
[54:02.880 --> 54:07.600]  of the chemicals and the food and the water and the vaccines that just made them mentally retarded
[54:07.600 --> 54:16.880]  and now they're just totally propagandized by weaponized media it's really sad though
[54:17.840 --> 54:23.520]  because you look at what's going on in Shanghai and you realize that could easily happen to you
[54:23.520 --> 54:30.800]  as that same notion that same prevalence of oppression and authoritarianism and tyranny
[54:30.800 --> 54:38.320]  and totalitarianism exists in America and it's people in positions of power that have the will
[54:38.320 --> 54:47.360]  to crush you and that's just like they're just lower level peons of the larger agenda
[54:48.400 --> 54:51.840]  which are the people that believe they're the exterminators of the cancer or the parasites
[54:51.840 --> 54:58.480]  on this planet that's you and me and and you know it's all a funny joke bill gates goes on
[54:58.480 --> 55:04.400]  ted talks and says if we do good with vaccines we can kill most of the planet and claus Schwab goes
[55:04.400 --> 55:08.080]  in front of the world economic forum and says we're going to make sure everybody hears a slave
[55:08.080 --> 55:14.480]  of our system but they'll be happy they brag about it so that's their commitment to evil and maybe
[55:14.480 --> 55:17.920]  they really have convinced themselves in their head that it's a good thing to kill all people
[55:17.920 --> 55:22.960]  because we're cancer on this planet maybe they really believe that but they've made that commitment
[55:22.960 --> 55:32.320]  and so if you're if you're a gazelle and you're getting chased by a lion and you know what you
[55:32.320 --> 55:38.800]  know what that line wants to do to you do you just stand there and say uh you know i'm just
[55:38.800 --> 55:45.120]  going to remain neutral here i'm just going to remain neutral on that lion wanting to gnaw my
[55:45.120 --> 55:52.560]  legs off and feed him do his cubs as i bleed out in the desert i'm going to be neutral on that
[55:52.560 --> 55:59.040]  or or is does the gazelle is the gazelle a genius because the gazelle knows that that line wants to
[55:59.040 --> 56:06.000]  eat it for for for dinner and so the gazelle is a genius so it runs or is the gazelle just an animal
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.480]  with basic survival instincts and it decides to run either way it makes that commitment it's not
[56:10.480 --> 56:16.640]  going to be eaten by the lion but even if it doesn't make that commitment it says i'm going to do
[56:16.640 --> 56:22.640]  nothing it gets eaten by the lion so that's where we're at right now but the great american
[56:22.640 --> 56:29.600]  awakening is happening folks it really is from doctors members of the media politicians athletes
[56:30.240 --> 56:37.920]  and just the everyday citizen that goes to work and punches the clock and raises a family takes
[56:37.920 --> 56:42.400]  care of their neighborhood and everything else people are realizing the decision is going to be
[56:42.400 --> 56:47.680]  made you can lay out and chill in that desert and say hey you know what i'm just going to hang out
[56:47.680 --> 56:52.320]  here i'm just going to be neutral and you can wait and that line will come chew you up for dinner
[56:52.320 --> 56:56.560]  or you can have the basic survival instinct or next level genius to realize that line is going
[56:56.560 --> 57:06.160]  to eat you maybe it's time to run away or maybe and it's not the best analogy but maybe it's time
[57:06.160 --> 57:11.040]  to get that line away maybe it's time to say this line that wants to eat us and kill us all maybe
[57:11.040 --> 57:15.920]  we need to get them off of this plane here with us but we're not dealing with a line we're dealing
[57:15.920 --> 57:27.600]  with satanic pedophile demonic creeps and see they just think it's the lower level ones think it's
[57:27.600 --> 57:35.600]  all just a game oh i'm going to pretend to be a girl and then win at sports but the the upper
[57:35.600 --> 57:43.760]  level of the cultural engineers they know exactly what they're doing making you so miserable that
[57:43.760 --> 57:53.040]  you invite suicide you invite death there's about 25 years ago that i wanted to expand
[57:53.040 --> 57:57.680]  info wars i've been on the air a couple of years but i only had money to finance my own simple
[57:57.680 --> 58:01.920]  little local radio show and i wanted to hire camera people i wanted to make films i wanted to
[58:01.920 --> 58:06.880]  really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt i designed the first one mass murderers
[58:06.880 --> 58:12.560]  agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew that's
[58:12.560 --> 58:17.680]  our oldest design and we're still selling we have that design over a hundred others that will now
[58:17.680 --> 58:22.880]  all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in that's it we're selling everything
[58:22.880 --> 58:27.600]  out to find the operation to get rid of inventory we'll still have some t-shirts in the future
[58:27.600 --> 58:32.240]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if you want to get any of these historic shirts

[59:01.920 --> 59:09.120]  listeners getting this original powerful coin a founding member coin we would not be on air today
[59:09.120 --> 59:15.040]  now the second coin the liberty tree coin is being offered and it will probably sell out
[59:15.040 --> 59:21.760]  in 10 days again it certainly needs to the front of operation it is so historic and it has a quote
[59:21.760 --> 59:26.320]  from thomas jefferson about the tree of liberty being refreshed with the blood of patriots and
[59:26.320 --> 59:34.080]  tyrants and more see the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com it's also at infowarstore.com

[59:39.600 --> 59:45.120]  we're planning something very very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level so

[59:52.640 --> 59:56.960]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:00:04.880 --> 1:00:11.120]  all right i've been kind of just ranting here or waxing if you will and it's just because and
[1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:17.280]  sometimes this is the problem here it's just you have all this stuff kind of clinking and clunking
[1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:22.400]  around your brain that you need to clear out before you can even really focus on the news so
[1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:26.480]  i'm just decided i'm going to take phone calls here in the next hour we got our two great guests
[1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:32.240]  coming on alex dine hosts the fourth hour and then i'm just going to do all the news coverage on the
[1:00:32.240 --> 1:00:35.600]  war room because there's a ton of it's important but i'm just going to wait until i get everything
[1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:42.720]  out of my head so i can really focus and cover the news with massive effectiveness and efficiency
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:47.280]  instead of just clunking around with all the stuff that's going on in my head and but let me just
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:54.800]  kind of encapsulate this or boil it down here to something and then we'll move on but we're taking
[1:00:54.800 --> 1:01:02.400]  your phone calls the rest of this hour and i want to give out the number right now 877-789-2539
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:13.760]  877-789-2539 only on do you believe we're going to see a similar situation here in America like what
[1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:21.600]  they're doing in Shanghai COVID lockdown 2.0 massive imprisonment 2.0 massive medical fascism
[1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:30.240]  slavery 2.0 coming to America in the year 2022 do you believe we're going to see that will we
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:39.280]  stave it off who's going to be responsible or the proprietors of that that's what we're talking
[1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:44.960]  about the rest of this hour but let me just draw back for a second here and try to complete this
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:51.120]  thought which is a separate thought but it's all connected because i'm sure you've noticed here
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:54.880]  you know things have been things have been a little different at info wars in the last couple months
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:02:00.880]  and a lot of that stuff you do know why and that's kind of just the tip of the iceberg from what's
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:06.320]  what's going on underneath the surface but you get the gist of it i mean you know what's going on
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:10.400]  a lot of our stuff is publicly talked about and how they want to destroy us and everybody knows
[1:02:10.400 --> 1:02:18.000]  we're most censored out there and everything else that goes on but alex has not been able to come on
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:22.640]  air as much lately there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes i mean i'm like talking to
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:29.600]  lawyers almost every day now i mean it's not it's not fun it's the cost of fighting this evil and
[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:36.080]  that's why they do this to us to try to scare other people off of fighting them culturally
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:42.240]  intellectually politically we're not violent here never were violent revolutionaries and so now
[1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:46.560]  that's what they want to try to paint us as or set us up as so that they can run their next false
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:50.960]  flag and you know i have a lot of people saying hey look the new york shooting today clearly a
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:59.120]  false flag no folks there's mass shootings in this country almost every day technically i mean they
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:03.760]  could pick any day any week whatever and and choose that we're going to cover this and we're going to
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:07.600]  make a big news story of it i mean there was just one in sacramento there was just another one i mean
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:15.680]  so they just decide so so it's a false flag in that they decide to make a shooting the biggest
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:23.040]  story of the day after joe biden talks about the guns doesn't mean the event didn't happen it just
[1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:28.480]  means that oh look we had a shooting happen let's make that the biggest story on the heels of biden
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:32.640]  talking about gun control in this country what a perfect thing they could do it any day they want
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:41.920]  folks case didn't notice but we have massive homicide rates in this country but see here's
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:49.200]  here's what i'm trying to boil it down to you know i don't know if it's a numbness or a punch
[1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:58.080]  drunkenness but what what is separated info wars really i mean forget about being prophetic
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:05.280]  or next year's news today or whatever you want to say what is really separated info wars it's
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:14.960]  been the sense of urgency now notice that the sense of urgency comes and goes now it's kind
[1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:21.360]  of like it comes in waves because it's like we're already in it the sense of urgency it's like it's
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:30.080]  past now it's like it's already here we're going to live it there's no fighting it off now i'm
[1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:36.400]  not saying i truly believe that but see you notice they're back out today saying if we don't stop
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:43.600]  carbon emissions then the planet's going to be dead in eight years see they don't actually
[1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:49.360]  have a sense of urgency they don't actually live the tales that they tell because it's all fake
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:55.280]  we had a sense of urgency because it's all real now we're living it and it's kind of like well
[1:04:55.280 --> 1:05:06.560]  what do we do now over the years info wars is produced more than 200 amazing patriot americana

[1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:23.680]  awin shroyer
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:32.560]  we're in the second hour of the alex joneshow and we are getting your calls lined up right now
[1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:39.760]  are we going to see the chinese style shanghai lockdowns in america as predicted by tucker
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:46.560]  carlson last night is it going to be that bad uh is it going to be like we saw in 2020 where they
[1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:51.520]  show it to us there first and they bring it here who are going to be the ones promoting it who are
[1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:58.720]  going to be the ones enforcing it those are our questions for the callers today and again the
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:03.600]  lines are already filled we're just taking your names right now and getting you up on the board so
[1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:13.840]  while we do that last week and it was overdue for me because we launched the info wars clearance
[1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:22.080]  sales or liquidation sales or emergency blowout sales a couple weeks ago because we reached a point
[1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:31.600]  financially where instead of selling things at a normal rate or selling things at a sales rate
[1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:37.200]  but still gave us a little bit of a profit margin we reached a point financially where
[1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:43.040]  we just have to sell everything and get the return on it immediately as quickly as possible
[1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:48.480]  forget about profit or whatever it's already money invested it's almost like we have equity in
[1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:53.520]  these products you could say and we need to get it back we need to just get that equity out of it
[1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:58.800]  now as quickly as possible to fund things in the future and so that's why we decided we're just
[1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:05.200]  going to sell every every piece of apparel that we have at infowarstore.com the hats the t-shirts
[1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:12.000]  all of it we're just going to sell it at cost because we need to sell everything now and even
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:19.120]  if we don't make a penny on it if we can at least get our return of investment immediately then we
[1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:25.920]  can fund ourselves the next couple months and hopefully survive this current onslaught that
[1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:30.000]  we're enduring right now and i'm sure you'll hear more about in the near future but i mean folks
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:36.240]  it's just crazy i don't even want to talk about it so that's what's going on at infowarstore.com
[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:43.600]  right now and what i'm saying is i placed my order because i like limited edition stuff it's
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:48.800]  just i just i just think it's cool stuff i'm kind of a collectible guy that way and so i went to
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:55.440]  infowarstore.com last week and i made my purchase i think i got like 20 t-shirts they finally arrived
[1:08:55.440 --> 1:09:02.240]  in the mail yesterday a big box of them and i also got some supplements as well but i just
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:10.000]  wanted to make sure that i secured my t-shirts from infowarstore.com they're all limited edition now
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.560]  so i wanted to make sure i secured my t-shirts that i wanted from infowarstore.com before they're
[1:09:14.560 --> 1:09:20.640]  gone so hold on to some of them as a keepsake give some of them away as gifts but i got about 20
[1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:28.240]  or 30 in the mail yesterday and i just got to say this the hats i hadn't ordered these hats for a
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.840]  while i've been meaning to i just had never placed the order and then they were sold out the one time
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:38.880]  i tried to the new style i guess it's this new style of trucker hat which i think is much more
[1:09:38.880 --> 1:09:45.840]  comfortable by the way than the plastic trucker hats that can sometimes rub against your ears or
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:50.960]  rub against the skin on your head and it's kind of uncomfortable maybe itchy kind of chafes you a
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:58.160]  little bit the new hats that we have the info wars hat and the save the frogs hat it's like this new
[1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:04.400]  style of trucker hat that's it's i don't know what it's like i don't know if it's cotton or polyester
[1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:10.560]  or blend or something but it's really soft and it is really comfortable and it is now going to be my
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:20.480]  go to golf hat i got yesterday two of the save the frogs hats and two of the info wars snake and

[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:07.920]  brains back get in the fight there these are monsters and half of the population i believe
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:14.640]  all over the world is on the antidepressants that are depressing our brains i was on them for 30
[1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:22.480]  years i got off them in 2020 when all this started to happen i could you would not believe how many

[1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:38.560]  china today but let me just say this in response to what you're saying because you're completely
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:45.840]  right i watched friends of mine who are athletes in high school really hurt themselves with pain
[1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:53.680]  killers i watched friends of mine in college who were just party animals really hurt themselves

[1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:08.880]  and it's very sad and so i just want to echo what kathy is saying and it's it's it's just you know
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:14.640]  it's part of this whole thing where our food is fake our water is poisoned our pharmaceutical
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:20.480]  drugs are supposed to help us hurt us but you just get away from everything establishment folks
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:24.240]  you just get away everything everything mainstream everything promoted by the mainstream you're
[1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:29.520]  going to be better off i'm telling you and big pharmaceutical drugs is just part of that equation
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:34.080]  but i want to focus on china today but kathy thank you for the call let's go to elie in south
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:40.720]  carolina elie you're on the air go ahead yeah i agree with you guys man like the communists they
[1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:46.240]  call things anti-depressants they really depress you they say they're gonna take the
[1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:51.040]  bible out of the school it's gonna be better for everybody the communists have been here they've
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:56.800]  been here yeah and you know i guess that is the that is the connection isn't it elie it's that
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:01.360]  the the same communists that are going to lock down china and treat everyone like a prisoner
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:04.720]  are going to do the same thing here they're the same people that lie to you about everything
[1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:15.120]  and they mock our freedom they get on the tv they talk about how perfect china is and all this
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:22.960]  they lie it's all they do it's all they know how to do is lie i mean you watch what's going on in
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:29.680]  china and you should be we should be kissing the ground that we live in this country
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:38.400]  we have our freedom right now and when they come to try and take it it's not going to
[1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:43.200]  happen the way they think well and i'll tell you what that's it exactly elie and then i'm not looking
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:50.800]  for a physical altercation i mean god forbid but i mean if they really try to pull something off
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:54.080]  with new covet lockdowns they're going to get so much pushback i mean
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:15:57.040]  maybe that'll be what sets off the great american awakening
[1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:02.960]  it's about 25 years ago that i wanted to expand in for worse i've been on the air a couple years

[1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:19.680]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now

[1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:25.840]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:25.840 --> 1:20:35.520]  slowly but surely you're seeing more signs more tells more symbols more moments more energy
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:44.880]  that there is a great awakening happening right now or a reawakening happening of americans
[1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:51.680]  their patriotism their love of god their love of country their love of freedom their love of family
[1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:59.920]  just the love of everything good and traditional that's worked and and has made this country into
[1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:07.520]  the prosperous bastion of freedom that it is where for the first time in human history morbidly
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:13.760]  obese people are poor you've never thought you've seen that now that has something to do with the
[1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:22.560]  diets but the point is there has been a great awakening bubbling underneath the surface in
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:27.760]  this country for a long time and this is going to be a major theme for me in the next couple months
[1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:38.000]  but what is it going to be that makes that volcano explode because right now it's just
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:42.240]  still bubbling under the surface and it's getting hotter and it's bubbling up a little bit more and
[1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:47.920]  you can tell there's activity going on and there's grumblings and the ground is starting to shake the
[1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:55.120]  magma is starting to move maybe some smoke starting to billow out of the top of the volcano but it's
[1:21:55.120 --> 1:22:03.360]  it's still not ready to blow if they try to do new covid lockdowns maybe that will be what blows
[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:09.680]  it up i don't think that would quite be it yet but maybe that would be it but we are sitting on a
[1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:16.320]  dormant volcano right now that is the american way of life that is the american will and desire
[1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:28.480]  and destiny to be free and prosperous and there's no lid there's no there's nothing the globalist
[1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:35.600]  can do to stop that volcano from blowing up and they'll try they are trying but they know if if
[1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:45.280]  the volcano ever does leave its stages of dormancy and and explodes it's game over and it'll be
[1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:51.760]  freedom worldwide it'll be western prosperity worldwide doesn't mean everybody will do everything
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:59.600]  the same it just means hey no individualism freedom free market free speech right to bear arms
[1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:06.880]  rugged individualism fear of god knowing there's a creator knowing there's a higher power pro human
[1:23:06.880 --> 1:23:14.000]  future that's where this goes but the globalist can't have that they've reached their scientific
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:19.600]  conclusion that we are termites on this planet or we are a cancer on this planet and therefore we
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:26.800]  must be eliminated and they just look at themselves as we are so lucky that we are self aware cancer
[1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:32.640]  cells or self aware parasites on this planet to kill ourselves before we kill the planet and kill
[1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:44.560]  all of us indefinitely would the chinese style lockdowns be what forces the volcano to blow up
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:49.600]  because i'm telling you folks we are sitting on a dormant volcano of american freedom just waiting
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:58.960]  just waiting to erupt and it's not going to be a violent thing it's it's the cultural shifts
[1:23:58.960 --> 1:24:03.760]  you're seeing it's doctors coming forward it's passers coming forward it's political leaders
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:11.280]  stepping up it's it's people in the news that are stepping up it's slowly but surely happening
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:17.520]  but something will send that into light speed could it be if they try to lock us down like
[1:24:17.520 --> 1:24:23.280]  they're doing in shanghai i mean who would ever support that we go back out to your phone lines
[1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:29.520]  kyle is dialed in from new york kyle you're on the alex joneshow go ahead hey oh and how's it going
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:36.240]  uh between you and i i think i'm a third or fourth time caller um i call you on the war room quite
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:43.440]  a bit last time we spoke i told i referenced the movie songbird and then the uh current us
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:48.400]  covid cases and i had said the only way that you could get to a point where these people
[1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:55.760]  can't go out at the time is the weakened immune systems however now there was one thing in that
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:25:01.920]  movie that i didn't see happening in real time and now it's there it's the drones flying over
[1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:06.480]  in the movie it's a surveillance thing in china it's a surveillance thing but they're trying to
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:15.520]  cripple spirit by telling them basically to shut up you know um so i see that movie songbird
[1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:22.000]  happening in china it happened in australia i also point to the super bowl and there's
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:27.520]  some symbolism there with the stage set up um these are these quarantine camps they are very
[1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:32.640]  much looking like how the super bowl set up and you know what i didn't watch that halftime
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:38.080]  show i didn't watch halftime shows i'm just gonna ask the crew to just pull up what you're talking
[1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:43.120]  about because i i still haven't seen it so if you type in quarantine camps china you'll see
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:49.040]  these like white cube looking structures and some people have pulled it up on instagram there was
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:54.640]  they didn't see much symbolism except for a dr dray hand motion at the end and they're like oh it was
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:25:59.680]  pretty tame now they it looks like they kind of foreshadowed it like hey this is what's going on
[1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:07.040]  next and snoop dog's coloring was kind of fitting to the flag of a conflict at the moment but um i
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:13.680]  i oh and i have to bring one thing up it has to do with that visor court document the numbers are
[1:26:13.680 --> 1:26:19.520]  a little bit off it's not just three percent you have to take out two groups that aren't accounted
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:24.960]  for the mortality rates a lot higher and i sent out an email uh to you guys i know you guys looking
[1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:31.680]  for specific people to to interview but i wrote it the email if you take out uh i believe it's
[1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:37.200]  unaccounted for or unknown that number shoots up a lot higher because this is at the time of the
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:44.000]  reporting from january and march um and it it it brings it up a lot four percent and then somewhere
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:51.760]  around possibly 52 percent um more they can take those numbers and do whatever they want with them
[1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:57.680]  so i mean you could have a hundred thousand vaccine injuries or vaccine deaths and they
[1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:02.320]  could just say oh it's coveted and lock us down again i mean it it's the perfect equation for
[1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:08.400]  total power biggest profit again to push wherever we're gonna see um i don't look the the only thing
[1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:14.240]  that i i tell people to do is find god at this point you know find christ you guys do a great
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:18.720]  job of that and i want to say god bless you and stay strong i know that it's tough but that movie
[1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:24.160]  songbird that trailer it's all happening now and and i would just recommend everyone take a youtube
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:29.760]  look uh because it's weird we you know we talked about it in the past but oh and uh i just want
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:36.400]  to say fizzy magnesium my mom loves it and i got it made in 1776 shirt uh you guys are awesome keep
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:42.320]  fighting thank you kyle fizzy magnesium available at info war store dot com i drank some fizzy

[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:59.520]  uh but just to kind of finish up on what he was saying there there's a new element to all of this
[1:27:59.520 --> 1:28:06.800]  that i was really researching researching this morning that i still don't fully understand
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:12.000]  so i'm not trying to come on air and talk about it yet and the best thing for me to do would probably
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:17.280]  be to research it a little bit further and then have dr brian artist back on air maybe later this
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:23.680]  week he was on the war room with me last night kind of teasing this but um covid 19 snake origin
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:30.400]  something weird is going on here folks again i i don't fully understand it but these are some of
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:35.120]  the old headlines from january 2020 china coronaviruses may have come from a snake
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:40.320]  wuhan coronavirus may have been transmitted from snakes snake mental monoc molecule shows
[1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:44.400]  promise and fight against covid 19 and it's all this old stuff how it came from snakes and
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:52.720]  there's all these uh common effects of snake venom and it's just it's just it's just gets
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:55.600]  weirder every day okay we don't live in kansas anymore

[1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:17.520]  it and it's just like oh well okay how's the world going to respond now the videos coming out of
[1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:26.800]  shanghai are horrifying horrifying folks whether it's the animals that they've put into bags to
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:32.640]  be beaten to death whether it's the images of people that are hanging themselves people jumping
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:36.800]  out of apartment buildings videos in the middle of the night where people just step out in their
[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:42.160]  balcony and record and all you hear is shrieking and and crying and screaming and it sounds like a
[1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:59.040]  horror film like a murder scene yeah listen to that they're locking people in their apartments
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:04.720]  folks literally barricading them imprisoning them and so all they can do is go out onto their balcony
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:10.480]  and just scream for help and then when they don't get it they jump out the window to their death
[1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:19.600]  oh my gosh i mean and just and you just think about how good this planet could be the human
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:25.040]  experience how awesome how incredible how unique how fantastical how mystical the whole thing is
[1:35:25.040 --> 1:35:30.960]  and then you have to deal with that evil you have to experience life like that
[1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:34.960]  it's evil folks it's satan
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:43.760]  so that's what i'm saying is i could just sit here for the entire broadcast and air all the
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:50.320]  shocking and horrifying videos and images and sounds coming out of china i just can't do it
[1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:59.520]  it's too heavy it it it breaks my heart it it it it sinks my stomach it collapses my soul
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:04.160]  to know that that's going on it's the same thing when you think about the january 6th
[1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:09.360]  defendants that are rotting in jail cells for over a year being tortured and tormented
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:16.640]  it just breaks your heart that somebody has to have their divine experience here on this planet
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:21.680]  this consciousness destroyed by satan destroyed by evil and they want to do it to all of us they
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:27.120]  want to kill us man it's a giant death call
[1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:35.200]  i mean these people celebrate murdering the baby before it's even born what do you think we're
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:40.320]  dealing with here let's go back out to the phone lines do you think we're going to see the chinese
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:47.040]  style lockdowns return here in america denise in the state of washington you're on the air go ahead
[1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:54.240]  hi uh yeah i really do believe that could be a distinct possibility i live in washington state
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:37:02.640]  my governor is j inslee uh dr malone outed in yesterday as a world economic forum fella
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:10.720]  and uh you know he's kind of been laying low but a few months back i watched a zoom meeting of our
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:17.920]  washington state board of education kind of got a heads up they were passing shenanigans about
[1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:24.560]  quarantining and uh it had to do with protection from aids but through that they
[1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:33.520]  um made legislation and can't do what they're doing in shanghai here in washington state
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:41.440]  i saw the ads where they already did hire people to run the quarantine camps i saw ivory hecker
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:49.040]  uh in visiting a quarantine camp in western washington uh she actually got stuck in there
[1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:54.640]  her her car did and uh so yeah i think it's a distinct possibility
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:00.880]  and what do you think happens if they try to do that or who is going to be promoting it
[1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:06.720]  i i mean it's just can you imagine them trying to do this again to us i mean you know all the
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:12.640]  old saying is fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me i mean are we going to be fooled
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:21.920]  twice again by this i think think uh cities like uh seattle uh lefty cities could be i live here on
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:30.240]  the east side it's weak country and there are a lot of guns here uh it'd be a little tougher it's
[1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:37.680]  more conservative on the east side of the cascades uh kind of two separate states in a state so to
[1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:45.200]  speak but uh i have family i come from with the island over there and all of my family's over
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:51.760]  there i'm the only one who's here and i have one who's conservative and the rest are you know shot
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:39:01.520]  and boosted and uh a sleep is and i mean they won't talk to us anymore uh and think we're nuts
[1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:08.640]  well that's a real shame and uh you know you wish them the best but uh these vaccines aren't working
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:20.720]  out so well for people and i just i think about if they really try to rule this out what it would
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:25.760]  look like and it would probably be the major cities where obviously it's going to be the worst
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:29.280]  and they'll shut down and maybe if you're out in a conservative rural area you won't have to deal
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:36.400]  with it but they've already projected that this is all coming they've already predicted
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:41.520]  predictive programming all of this coming and you know what here here's the stance that needs
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:49.760]  to be taken now by anybody in our government that doesn't want to see that tyranny come here or
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:54.640]  anybody that doesn't want to see the covet tyranny come here in any form lockdown shutdowns shutdowns
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:02.800]  whatever the stance the logic the argument needs to be because they could release a really deadly
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:08.080]  virus that actually kills 50 of people you know i mean they could they could do whatever they want
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:17.680]  i don't care the stance needs to be that if there's a virus that kills 90 of people that get it
[1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:24.160]  you still can't force somebody into a lockdown you still can't force somebody to shut their
[1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:31.920]  business down you can't force somebody to be a prisoner it's called freedom you want to take
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:38.560]  the risk of going outside during a deadly pandemic or during a tornado or anything you have that right
[1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:44.480]  that needs to be the intellectual approach to this but our politicians are so far behind it'll
[1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:48.560]  never even happen and they'll probably just go along with the whole thing and get scared by
[1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:54.320]  whatever numbers they're told to believe uh denise thank you for the call we'll stay there in washington
[1:40:54.320 --> 1:41:03.920]  where sky has called in sky you're on the alex joneshow go ahead hi alex joneshow thanks owin uh
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:13.040]  so fear not now but uh i just wanted to mention we got to be strong uh what's going on in shanghai
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:20.080]  is terrible it reminds me of the dr lee man young who was a whistleblower who was on a lot of broadcast
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:25.120]  and i think she mentioned what i've been hearing i don't know if it's true but hemorrhagic fever
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:33.760]  going on but this type of uh disease outbreak is what title 42 is meant to protect on our border
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:37.440]  as well and uh oh yeah which they lifted that
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:44.880]  yeah owin so it's good to talk to you god bless you all and uh those are the two points i was
[1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:53.600]  mentioning well thank you for the call but imagine that they revoke title 42 which means
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:42:00.320]  anyone can come into the border i mean it's all just it's all just ceremonious so it really
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:05.920]  doesn't make a difference quite frankly but there were some precautions or some procedures another
[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:11.440]  form of protection for our border uh because of the deadly pandemic that they got rid of
[1:42:11.440 --> 1:42:19.600]  so the white house gets rid of pandemic protocols at the southern border but then they fight tooth
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:27.280]  and nail to keep you wearing a mask at airports and on airplanes this this government is so
[1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:35.440]  evil and such a joke man i just i why why are we so pathetic what has happened to us

[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:54.560]  i'm really not i mean yeah we all get blackpilled and depressed about what we see going on in the
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:48:01.920]  world but i have no doubt just as satan's army is moving and satan is getting his reign of power
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:09.040]  on planet earth right now i have no doubt that god's legions of of angels and good people
[1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:17.040]  are going to be pushing back on it tenfold my real concern is just when is that going to happen
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:25.440]  and will i even be around to witness it because this evil cannot rule over planet earth for very
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:30.800]  long i mean we're already reaching points of insanity that just we should have never reached on
[1:48:30.800 --> 1:48:36.720]  this planet before i mean men are women men competing in women's sports i mean that's just
[1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:41.600]  one little thing uh teaching kids how to be sexually perverted teaching kids how to be racist
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:48.960]  i mean it's just total insanity you can't live like this forever this is not human in human
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:57.680]  destiny here so satan's getting its its its command right now satan's legions and satan's
[1:48:57.680 --> 1:49:02.000]  armies are getting their control of this planet right now and that's why you're witnessing all
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:08.960]  this insanity from the torture and human imprisonment um for false political reasons or
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:15.920]  false health reasons to the teaching the youth how to be sexual perverts and hateful bigots
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:26.720]  to just all the lies that you're told about health about drugs about your body where we came from
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:32.480]  it's all going to fall ladies and gentlemen
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:41.920]  and all this misery that humanity has had to go through will be ended but but it comes and it
[1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:50.480]  goes that's why the bible is so prophetic because this is the pattern of humanity satan gets his
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:58.400]  time to reign the world becomes an evil dastardly place human suffer the blood of the innocent is
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:07.360]  shed and then god and jesus intervene to put satan back down where he belongs in hell
[1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:14.880]  but uh yeah you're you're gonna watch uh you're gonna watch leftist liberals um
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:19.760]  i mean folks they're just gonna start i mean they're already molesting kids i mean let's
[1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:23.840]  call it what it is when you take a little kid to a strip club and teach him how to be a stripper
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:28.800]  when when you take a little kid and you bounce him on your lap with your with your uh with your
[1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:38.480]  penis exposed i mean that's that's molesting kids that's not drag queen story time that's
[1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:47.360]  molesting kids your grooming children is what you're doing so yeah i mean how much more evil
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:55.600]  does it get than sexually grooming children before they can even read or write or ride a bike
[1:50:55.600 --> 1:51:06.240]  or tie their shoes or do or do multiplication i mean how much worse than that can it get
[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:12.800]  is it what's worse sexually grooming and perverting children and teaching them how to
[1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:20.160]  be hateful bigots or locking down an entire city of 23 million people and making them prisoners
[1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:28.960]  in their own home completely unnecessarily it's all the same satanic energy it all must be rejected
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:36.640]  at all costs we cannot go on like this oh how much more do we have to endure
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:45.120]  or what are they what is satan going to do to us next let's go back out to the phone lines king
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:54.000]  in missouri you're on the alex joneshow king go ahead hey what's up on uh core here so i want to
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:52:00.400]  say something real quick i've been a minister for 10 years and the bible says that satan has
[1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:07.840]  already been judged john 1611 jesus said that he gives us power to trample on serpents and
[1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:14.640]  scorpions and to overcome all the powers of the enemy so we have to have the right picture the
[1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:20.080]  right imagination see we're you just say what is satan going to do to us next what if it was
[1:52:20.800 --> 1:52:27.280]  satan saying what are they going to do to me next we have to get on the offense as americans
[1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:33.520]  and the founding fathers in the declaration of independence said something could i share it
[1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:42.640]  with you real quick go ahead it says whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these
[1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:50.640]  ends life liberty pursuit of happiness it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it
[1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:57.440]  and institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
[1:52:57.440 --> 1:53:04.240]  such form as to them shall see most likely to affect their safety and happiness we have to
[1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:13.040]  abolish a wicked satanic government we have to declare independence from satanism and globalism
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:20.160]  and get back to our pledge of allegiance and we need to arrest close down these satan churches
[1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:25.920]  man god's not happy with that they are terrorists they need to be labeled terrorists satanists they
[1:53:25.920 --> 1:53:33.280]  want to kill steal destroy well look i completely agree you don't have to convince me i've already
[1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:40.640]  you know i've experienced this for myself and so uh you know it's i mean what do we have to
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:45.600]  wait for is it a miracle is i mean our new leader is going to step forward and do something i mean
[1:53:45.600 --> 1:53:50.080]  i'm not i mean obviously nobody can really know but it's just like how is this all going to be
[1:53:50.080 --> 1:53:56.080]  resolved we can't i mean we can't go on like this forever this is insane no and god is saying the
[1:53:56.080 --> 1:54:02.400]  time is over but god's people have to stand up and be these new guards we can't have halfway on the
[1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:07.600]  fence christians trying to stand up in government and protect us because they bow down to satan
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:13.440]  they're not tough they're not having been qualified by god well i guess that's it what is it going to
[1:54:13.440 --> 1:54:20.560]  take for the average american that's not awoken to to the world and and this satanic takeover
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:25.360]  that's happening what is it going to take for the average american to get it what is it going to take
[1:54:26.240 --> 1:54:30.000]  and i'm afraid to answer that question quite honestly because i've seen what we've put up with
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:36.880]  to this point and there is not nearly enough pushback i mean we don't have 10 of the amount
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:41.520]  of pushback we need to save this country right now i mean we probably don't even have five folks
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:48.240]  i travel around man and i talk to almost everyone i talk to is awake and i've been talking to lots
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:53.120]  of people in the military they're like we're just waiting and the thing about is if you
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:59.920]  establish a new form of government just like in the holocaust israel established and they form
[1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:08.720]  nazi hunters and adne urmberg 2.0 if any nation would say hey we're creating a group to go after
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:14.720]  this list of criminals and every person in every state needs to have a list of the criminals in
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:19.760]  their state because if they want a war we will know yeah i mean that that's what we need is we
[1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:24.240]  need nurenberg style trials we need to arrest the criminals that have committed all these crimes
[1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:29.280]  against humanity and it's the intellectual elite who believe they've conquered the planet but they're
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:33.280]  new that now the stewards of the planet and so they're going to kill billions of people
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:39.840]  to save planet earth that's their conclusion or at least what they project as their conclusion
[1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:45.760]  what they talk about in their inner circles is their conclusion and so but what you said is
[1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:49.920]  interesting and i've heard i have a similar experience too and i thank you for the call
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:58.080]  i agree most people are awake most people think the same way you think or i think they just
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:03.360]  they don't see the world for what it is quite yet they don't fully understand what's being done
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:10.240]  quite yet but they they see the evil they call out the evil they know something's wrong but what
[1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:22.000]  you said was it's like they're waiting and that's the problem and i'm partly guilty too because
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:27.520]  i'm almost waiting every day for god to do something i mean you know because i just accept
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:32.880]  it i'm not in control of these things i mean i can do whatever i'm capable of doing i'll pray
[1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:39.200]  for god's strength and guidance and all that but yeah it's almost like okay i mean i'm i'm set to
[1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:45.200]  be totally destroyed here so god please you know whenever you see fit or whatever you see fit but
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:51.760]  you know whenever you see fit or whatever you see fit but everyone's waiting everyone's waiting
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:57:02.000]  for someone else to be the hero and that's the problem that's the problem and that's part of
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:11.840]  the hollywood dc marvel comic book movie propaganda is that you get used to this idea that someone
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:17.920]  else is going to save the world someone else is going to be the hero so you never fill that role
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:23.760]  you you're you're taught to believe that someone else will be your hero you're taught to believe
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:35.600]  there's a superhero coming to rescue you there's not there's only one hero that's going to save you
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:42.480]  that's on this planet in human form right now and if you want to find that hero you'll find a mirror
[1:57:48.560 --> 1:57:52.960]  it was about 25 years ago that i wanted to expand in for worse i've been on here a couple of years
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:57.920]  but i only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show and i wanted to hire
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:02.720]  camera people i wanted to make films i wanted to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt
[1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:08.960]  i designed the first one mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance hiring the
[1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:13.440]  first two members of my crew that's our oldest design and we're still selling we have that

[1:58:47.680 --> 1:58:53.200]  you know it's a fact and i'm not bragging when i say it it's just true that info wars is seen by
[1:58:53.200 --> 1:59:01.600]  the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against
[1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:10.000]  their transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is really right now hitting the most important

[2:00:14.800 --> 2:00:23.520]  be joined by our guest alex michael uh sad story of a vaccine side effect that the media doesn't
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:29.760]  want you to know about because they're paid by paid for by the vaccine manufacturers uh but quickly
[2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:35.840]  a couple more calls here let's go to monti in florida monti you're on the alex joneshow go ahead
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:43.040]  it's a privilege to be on the air with you today it's my first time and um about the um second
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:49.200]  round of lockdowns i think they are coming back and sadly i think it's going to coincide with the
[2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:55.360]  upcoming election seems to be there um how they like to play things um but i wanted to touch on
[2:00:55.360 --> 2:01:01.040]  something you said earlier in the first hour about committing to evil and um as a school board
[2:01:01.040 --> 2:01:06.800]  candidate myself down here in her nando county florida um people really have a choice they can
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:14.000]  either sit back and let these the perverts in our schools uh groom our kids um an outside the
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:18.320]  school system you can sit back and let these chinese style lockdowns happen or you can choose to
[2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:26.080]  commit to fight um for example down here in her nando county when the school board defied the
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:32.080]  governor on the mask mandate um i took great inspiration from you guys especially you on and
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:38.960]  alex i showed up to the very next school board meeting in a full biohazard suit and um i mocked
[2:01:38.960 --> 2:01:43.520]  them heavily and i got other parents involved in mocking the school board they showed up in
[2:01:43.520 --> 2:01:48.400]  halloween masks and such so our county even though they defied governor desantis on the
[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:55.440]  mask mandate we were able to end it after about uh a month and one of the board members came to me
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:02:00.320]  and said as long as you people stop coming up here in costumes we'll end these mask mandates
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:05.520]  right now uh so that is committing to a fight people have to really get out there and fight
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:10.800]  back against this regardless of lockdowns mask mandates or whatever and i strongly urge your
[2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:15.840]  listeners consider running for office i'm running for a school board here in her nando county i'm
[2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:21.440]  not a politician i'm a father uh we actually homeschool our kids but we're paying out the
[2:02:21.440 --> 2:02:26.320]  nose and taxes and my kids are going to grow up and have to live with all these um these sexually
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:30.480]  abused kids and the warped reality that the school system is creating for them
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:35.680]  well and and to get back to what you said about
[2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:42.640]  committing to evil or committing to fighting against evil is you know that that's the problem
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:49.360]  is most people just wake up and comply with it they just comply with it and that's why it gets
[2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:54.560]  worse and worse and and you know i i do believe there's some sort of a sixth sense that we all
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:03:00.240]  innately have that we all understand this is why we live in fear instead of giving that fear to god
[2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:07.440]  and being fearless is that we know satan runs this planet you know that when you start to stand up
[2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:13.680]  against good and you become a leader in that stand that the system that satanic is going to be turned
[2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:19.920]  against you and you could be destroyed everybody knows that that's why nobody speaks up that's
[2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:25.440]  why they're letting pedophile groomers have access to their kids in the schools because i mean that's
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:30.240]  what i'm saying is i'm not a parent i don't have a kid in these schools getting taught how to be
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:37.520]  perverts okay i don't have perverts coming to teach my kids but it's like how do parents put up with
[2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:44.960]  that so i go down the intellectual thought process okay the parents put up with it because they don't
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:50.880]  want to take a stand because they're afraid what might happen to them the school doesn't the school
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:54.160]  puts up with it because they don't want to take a stand because they're afraid of it's going to
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:58.320]  happen to them the law enforcement puts up with it because they don't want to take a stand because
[2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:01.920]  they're afraid of what's going to happen to them and you say but wait a second what's going to
[2:04:01.920 --> 2:04:08.000]  happen to them you're going to get fired you're going to lose your pension you're going to lose
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:11.760]  your retirement you're going to lose your bank account you're going to lose your free speech
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:15.440]  You're going to be arrested, you're going to be lied about, you're going to be demonized,
[2:04:15.440 --> 2:04:18.160]  you're going to be physically attacked.
[2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:19.160]  So what do they do?
[2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:24.920]  They comply with evil because they'd rather be complicit with evil than have evil attacking
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:29.880]  them, but evil's already attacking them.
[2:04:29.880 --> 2:04:36.880]  And that's why the story in V for Vandetta, that's the analogy here is it's not saying
[2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:43.120]  you have to die and face death to understand, but to understand you're already under attack
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:44.880]  from evil.
[2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:49.080]  Just complying with it doesn't mean it's going to stop, it just means maybe you'll have a
[2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:53.440]  little lesser of a problem with the evil conquering you.
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:05:20.440]  But the sense of urgency from parents is really, I mean, it needs to step up.
[2:05:20.440 --> 2:05:38.080]  But this is true, we have a very good relationship with this and we have peace between human
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:40.320]  We've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all,
[2:05:40.320 --> 2:05:41.600]  and they're limited edition,
[2:05:41.600 --> 2:05:45.560]  because we're never gonna make any of these designs again.
[2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:47.840]  We are going to come out with some new designs
[2:05:47.840 --> 2:05:50.520]  that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[2:05:50.520 --> 2:05:52.760]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air,
[2:05:52.760 --> 2:05:55.440]  plus it spreads the word, infowarstore.com,
[2:05:55.440 --> 2:05:58.040]  your historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[2:05:58.040 --> 2:06:10.040]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[2:06:10.040 --> 2:06:13.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[2:06:13.360 --> 2:06:16.640]  and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:06:16.640 --> 2:06:21.840]  Unnecessary government intervention in our lives
[2:06:21.840 --> 2:06:24.240]  needs to be stopped,
[2:06:24.240 --> 2:06:27.360]  because what's happened is our governments
[2:06:27.360 --> 2:06:29.440]  are now satanic.
[2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:32.640]  They are corrupted, they are evil, they are demonic,
[2:06:32.640 --> 2:06:38.000]  they are filled with members of a death cult
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:40.960]  that believe it's their job as stewards of the planet
[2:06:40.960 --> 2:06:43.760]  to eliminate the human population or the human virus
[2:06:43.760 --> 2:06:45.720]  as they see it on the planet.
[2:06:45.720 --> 2:06:47.400]  Now, why do I say that?
[2:06:47.400 --> 2:06:50.600]  Leading into my next guest, Alex Mitchell,
[2:06:50.600 --> 2:06:54.720]  who has sadly had a bad vaccine injury happen to him,
[2:06:54.720 --> 2:06:59.040]  because when your government is evil and satanic
[2:06:59.040 --> 2:07:01.440]  and you allow the government to intervene in your life
[2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:02.840]  whenever it sees fit,
[2:07:02.840 --> 2:07:06.760]  well, how do you think that's going to go, folks?
[2:07:06.760 --> 2:07:08.360]  And so that's what this is,
[2:07:08.360 --> 2:07:11.320]  an unnecessary government intervention in your life
[2:07:11.320 --> 2:07:15.760]  by way of an injection that they're calling a vaccine
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:17.520]  that isn't even a vaccine.
[2:07:17.520 --> 2:07:21.560]  And you can say, well, the government didn't mandate that.
[2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:24.520]  Well, maybe it wasn't your actual United States government,
[2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:26.480]  but it was the corporate government
[2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:28.320]  or it was the US government influencing
[2:07:28.320 --> 2:07:30.360]  the corporate government.
[2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:33.920]  That's how this works, folks.
[2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:37.160]  And so Alex Mitchell is from Scotland
[2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:41.960]  and he sadly, because of government intervention,
[2:07:41.960 --> 2:07:44.840]  was told to get an AstraZeneca vaccine
[2:07:44.840 --> 2:07:46.920]  and had to have his leg amputated
[2:07:46.920 --> 2:07:50.680]  after it was confirmed to be a vaccine injury.
[2:07:50.680 --> 2:07:55.120]  Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia,
[2:07:55.120 --> 2:07:58.040]  I may be butchering that, but you get the point.
[2:07:58.040 --> 2:08:01.320]  And so he is here with us today with one less leg,
[2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:03.160]  totally unnecessarily,
[2:08:03.160 --> 2:08:08.040]  but because of government intervention that was unnecessary.
[2:08:08.040 --> 2:08:10.440]  Now he's here with us today, thestoryatinfowars.com.
[2:08:10.440 --> 2:08:12.920]  Vaccine whore, man describes losing leg
[2:08:12.920 --> 2:08:15.120]  after AstraZeneca jab.
[2:08:15.120 --> 2:08:19.320]  And so Alex, not just losing your leg,
[2:08:19.320 --> 2:08:20.840]  you should have never had to deal with that,
[2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:25.280]  but also other problems post-vaccine.
[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:27.920]  What has it been like for you almost a year now
[2:08:27.920 --> 2:08:30.960]  from your vaccine injury?
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:33.320]  It was actually a year yesterday
[2:08:33.320 --> 2:08:37.000]  when I was the anniversary of me having my left leg amputated
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:39.600]  from above the knee.
[2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:42.920]  The year has been everything you can imagine
[2:08:42.920 --> 2:08:47.560]  in your worst nightmare and probably more.
[2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:50.120]  It's more compounded
[2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:54.520]  that you're trying to get a health back,
[2:08:54.520 --> 2:08:56.200]  to try and get some support,
[2:08:56.200 --> 2:08:58.760]  to then we find that the government
[2:08:58.760 --> 2:09:02.000]  asked you to do the right thing for the right reasons,
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.240]  to save lives, to protect the NHS,
[2:09:04.240 --> 2:09:08.040]  to protect the medical staff.
[2:09:08.040 --> 2:09:12.520]  People did that, did it for a good reason,
[2:09:12.520 --> 2:09:14.000]  and they lied to us.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.720]  They knew there was problems with these vaccines,
[2:09:16.720 --> 2:09:20.400]  test trials, whatever you want to call them.
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:24.120]  The result of which, people like myself
[2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:27.040]  have been in a real, real bad position.
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:31.000]  I've been left not only unable to work anymore,
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:34.280]  I've got other health issues that I never had before.
[2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:37.840]  I now have an eyesight problem with my right eye.
[2:09:37.840 --> 2:09:40.320]  I'm waiting on a scan for that.
[2:09:40.320 --> 2:09:42.080]  I've had numerous scans.
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:45.600]  My blood is still checked every two weeks.
[2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:48.200]  I still speak with hematology.
[2:09:48.200 --> 2:09:50.320]  Conference calls every three months.
[2:09:50.320 --> 2:09:52.920]  I had one in Tuesday when I had some good news
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:57.880]  that I'm no longer at a stage where
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:01.360]  I'm now able to go and receive dental work.
[2:10:01.360 --> 2:10:03.440]  I've not even been able to go and receive dental work
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:05.840]  because of what's happened to my bloods.
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:11.080]  The condition fit vaccine in just thrombiotic thrombocenia
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:13.480]  is a hard word to say.
[2:10:13.480 --> 2:10:16.440]  What it means in English, plain speak,
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:20.200]  is that the vaccine has caused my platelets to drop,
[2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:22.280]  my D-diameter to go through the roof,
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:25.240]  and there's an antibody in your blood.
[2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:28.040]  It's called negative PF4.
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:30.840]  That's what keeps your blood the consistency it is.
[2:10:30.840 --> 2:10:36.120]  With the condition, it becomes positive,
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:39.160]  which then means that your blood just wants to clot.
[2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:43.120]  I'm now on permanent medication to thin my blood.
[2:10:43.120 --> 2:10:45.080]  It looks like I'll be on that medication
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:47.560]  for the rest of my life.
[2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:49.600]  I now have some side problems where
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:53.720]  I think probably a micro clot has maybe exploded in my eye.
[2:10:53.720 --> 2:10:55.920]  So they're going to have that looked at
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:10:58.000]  because the damage is not natural.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:10:59.880]  So there's lots of side effects.
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:04.480]  They've taken a lot of my life away
[2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:06.920]  because I've spent the last year basically fighting
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:11.360]  to try and get some kind of support from anyone
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:14.440]  other than basic state benefits.
[2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:17.960]  Now, I've never been unemployed in my life.
[2:11:17.960 --> 2:11:21.400]  State benefits is not something I'm used to.
[2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:23.480]  I've got a mortgage, I've got a car,
[2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:25.600]  and everyone else, I've got both of them.
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:27.440]  I've got two children, they're older,
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:29.240]  and they're not staying with me,
[2:11:29.240 --> 2:11:32.720]  but I've still got children, I've still got family.
[2:11:32.720 --> 2:11:35.520]  I've tried to take what I believe is my passion.
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:37.240]  Now, the picture that you flashed up there
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:41.120]  was me on my scooter, minus my leg.
[2:11:41.120 --> 2:11:43.840]  That was my passion, that was my life.
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:46.480]  I was quite happy being me.
[2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:49.760]  I was quite happy to fade into mediocrity,
[2:11:49.760 --> 2:11:51.440]  but they've tried to take that away from me
[2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:53.360]  and so many others.
[2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:57.600]  There's 438 vips in the UK alone.
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:01.160]  Sadly, 78 were tragic.
[2:12:01.160 --> 2:12:02.960]  They were fatal cases.
[2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:05.680]  I'm now friends with some of their wives,
[2:12:05.680 --> 2:12:07.800]  their mothers, their husbands,
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:10.600]  their daughters, their partners.
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:12.120]  It's heartbreaking.
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:16.520]  These people have been confirmed to have bicarbonate,
[2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:20.840]  to have passed solely by the AstraZeneca vaccine,
[2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:23.680]  and yet the British government is still holding out
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:25.000]  some government-based people's support.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:29.320]  And myself, there is 922 claims
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:32.600]  against the UK vaccine damage payment scheme
[2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:34.520]  in the last two years.
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:36.760]  They have not paid anyone out.
[2:12:36.760 --> 2:12:38.560]  Not a single claim.
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:42.000]  They have not supported a single family.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:46.080]  That's just the 920 that met the criteria
[2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:49.720]  of now being medically 60% disabled.
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:52.400]  There is millions and thousands around the world,
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:55.000]  but particularly thousands,
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:57.640]  that are fighting just to get acknowledged
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:00.400]  that this has been caused by a vaccine.
[2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:02.840]  They've got a fight, I've not got it,
[2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:04.520]  and I don't understand that fight.
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:05.560]  I'm lucky.
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:07.400]  I've got all the medical paperwork,
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:10.320]  I've got all the evidence, I've got all the proof.
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:12.520]  It's all in writing.
[2:13:12.520 --> 2:13:13.760]  Everything.
[2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:16.000]  I've got a letter that says,
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.080]  I am not allowed another vaccine
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:21.800]  because of my reaction to a vaccine.
[2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:24.600]  I have not worked in a year.
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:26.120]  I'm not allowed to work
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:29.040]  because my blood's still unstable.
[2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:31.400]  And as I say, I'm one of the lucky ones.
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:34.120]  I've got the evidence, I've got the medical evidence,
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:37.480]  I've got the medical team behind me, backing me.
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:40.520]  But there is thousands upon thousands
[2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:44.120]  of people that I'm in touch with on a daily basis.
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:47.840]  Some of them, these people have now become very close friends
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:51.800]  because their lives have been the same as mine.
[2:13:51.800 --> 2:13:56.840]  Now, whatever you think whether it was a virus, not a virus,
[2:13:56.840 --> 2:13:58.880]  is neither here nor there.
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:02.080]  Our governments coerced us, pushed us to do the right thing.
[2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:06.120]  They told us not to hub our grannies.
[2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:10.560]  Some of what they've told us, and now they were partying.
[2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:12.800]  The Prime Minister of the UK
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:15.720]  and the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the UK
[2:14:15.720 --> 2:14:20.160]  were partying while people were dying.
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:22.880]  This is the content that these people have
[2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:25.160]  for vaccine damage on you guys.
[2:14:25.160 --> 2:14:27.520]  I'm very angry.
[2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:31.440]  I'm very, my life has been destroyed.
[2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:34.640]  I refuse to back down to these people.
[2:14:34.640 --> 2:14:39.960]  These people have to be called to action.
[2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:42.920]  These people will not even talk to us.
[2:14:42.920 --> 2:14:45.160]  All we want to do is let's talk.
[2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:47.200]  It's not difficult.
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:51.560]  We're not going to go anywhere, there's too many of us.
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:59.000]  I know that in the US that the condition is very, very unheard of
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.640]  because I'm aware of two, maybe three cases in the USA.
[2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:05.560]  Canada is quite a few.
[2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:07.640]  New Zealand is quite a few.
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:09.240]  Australia is quite a few.
[2:15:09.240 --> 2:15:12.800]  Norway had a lot.
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:16.520]  Norway were the first people to see the problems
[2:15:16.520 --> 2:15:19.480]  with the clotting issues.
[2:15:19.480 --> 2:15:22.440]  All we want is someone to help us.
[2:15:22.440 --> 2:15:26.520]  Mainstream media do not want to help us, do not want to know.
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:31.120]  Politicians, you know, I've been down the official route
[2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:36.120]  through my MP who has been fantastic, has written letters
[2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:39.960]  to both government departments.
[2:15:39.960 --> 2:15:43.000]  One department didn't even acknowledge an MP's letter.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.480]  We got to take a break here, Alex,
[2:15:45.480 --> 2:15:48.920]  but this is very powerful stuff and you're not going to get your wish
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:50.640]  of fading into mediocrity now.
[2:15:50.640 --> 2:15:52.400]  You're going to have to be a leader for truth
[2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:53.760]  and that's what you've become.
[2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:57.200]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:57.200 --> 2:15:59.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:02.600]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:06.600]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:07.680]  I was born for this.
[2:16:07.680 --> 2:16:11.280]  You were born for this and people are really waking up right now.
[2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:13.720]  But we had to build our own infrastructure
[2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:16.240]  because of the censorship and the platforming
[2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:17.840]  that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:21.880]  And now with Bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day,
[2:16:21.880 --> 2:16:25.240]  we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:29.400]  and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:34.040]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:37.440]  Info wars and Bandot video have become a mothership
[2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:40.280]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[2:16:40.280 --> 2:16:44.840]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter,
[2:16:44.840 --> 2:16:46.840]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[2:16:46.840 --> 2:16:50.000]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now.
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:53.160]  The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,
[2:16:53.160 --> 2:16:57.200]  getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[2:16:57.200 --> 2:17:01.880]  There is very little contemporary study in the world
[2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:05.600]  of the planet's ruling class, not in communist China,
[2:17:05.600 --> 2:17:09.800]  not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[2:17:09.800 --> 2:17:13.360]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[2:17:13.360 --> 2:17:15.240]  And that's done by design.
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:18.200]  The large central banks that basically control the planet
[2:17:18.200 --> 2:17:22.120]  will penalize and target any academics that look into,
[2:17:22.120 --> 2:17:24.480]  say, the Anglo-American establishment,
[2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:25.680]  the founder of the Bilderberg group,
[2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:27.880]  the trilateral commission of the United Nations,
[2:17:27.880 --> 2:17:31.120]  the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:34.480]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the control corporate media,
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:36.920]  the Bilderberg group didn't exist.
[2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:40.280]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head,
[2:17:40.280 --> 2:17:43.080]  still on the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab.
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:45.880]  And he has set up the great reset in global government
[2:17:45.880 --> 2:17:48.360]  and if, as a liberty movement worldwide,
[2:17:48.360 --> 2:17:50.720]  we don't address the globalist head-on,
[2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:53.120]  about the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate
[2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:54.840]  takeover, we don't have a shot.
[2:17:54.840 --> 2:17:56.440]  We do expose them, we can beat them easily.

[2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:17.760]  with all the criminal activity they're involved in,
[2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:19.080]  it is more important than ever,

[2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:01.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:20:01.920 --> 2:20:05.520]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:09.680]  We're here with Alex Mitchell from Scotland,
[2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:13.160]  and he has sadly had severe side effects
[2:20:13.160 --> 2:20:16.960]  from his AstraZeneca injection,
[2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:21.800]  including a leg amputation and just continued blood problems.
[2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:24.520]  It looks like it's gonna be a lifelong thing
[2:20:24.520 --> 2:20:26.320]  for him to deal with.
[2:20:26.320 --> 2:20:28.160]  And here's what people need to know
[2:20:28.160 --> 2:20:29.280]  about this vaccine,
[2:20:29.280 --> 2:20:32.640]  and it's a good thing to know about this vaccine.
[2:20:32.640 --> 2:20:36.520]  And here's what people need to understand
[2:20:36.520 --> 2:20:38.960]  and why Kevin's story is so important.
[2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:45.280]  This is really, it already is on that level,
[2:20:45.280 --> 2:20:48.760]  but we'll just say you're one step away
[2:20:48.760 --> 2:20:50.800]  from government-mandated death.
[2:20:51.800 --> 2:20:55.120]  And really, you're already there, quite frankly,
[2:20:55.120 --> 2:20:57.240]  but for some people, they might not be ready
[2:20:57.240 --> 2:21:00.160]  to understand that intellectual conclusion.
[2:21:00.160 --> 2:21:03.160]  When the government can mandate you to have
[2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:05.680]  an experimental medical procedure,
[2:21:05.680 --> 2:21:08.240]  or any medical procedure, for that matter,
[2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:12.080]  that results in death, that's government-mandated death.
[2:21:13.360 --> 2:21:17.520]  I don't wanna be in a civilization
[2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:22.520]  that has government-mandated death.
[2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:24.520]  And that's where this is going, folks.
[2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:28.000]  So that's why I get freaked out about this.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.720]  That's why I stand guard against this.
[2:21:30.720 --> 2:21:33.320]  And that's why I'm not just pissed off
[2:21:33.320 --> 2:21:35.800]  that this is going on, but infuriated
[2:21:35.800 --> 2:21:39.000]  that other people don't understand this.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:40.640]  If the government can mandate you
[2:21:40.640 --> 2:21:41.720]  to have a medical procedure,
[2:21:41.720 --> 2:21:44.120]  the government can mandate you to death.
[2:21:44.120 --> 2:21:47.160]  And that's where this goes.
[2:21:47.160 --> 2:21:50.640]  And so I saw Alex nodding his head in agreement,
[2:21:50.640 --> 2:21:54.600]  but comment on that, or first, let me ask you this, though.
[2:21:54.600 --> 2:21:58.120]  What was it that prompted you to get the vaccine?
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:21:59.520]  Was it mandated by government?
[2:21:59.520 --> 2:22:00.920]  Was it mandated by work?
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:02.840]  Did you believe that it was gonna help
[2:22:02.840 --> 2:22:04.000]  get things back to normal?
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:06.400]  What was your motivation to taking
[2:22:06.400 --> 2:22:10.720]  the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine just over a year ago?
[2:22:12.640 --> 2:22:16.120]  In January, February, there was a lot.
[2:22:16.120 --> 2:22:18.200]  My mom was elderly.
[2:22:18.200 --> 2:22:22.320]  Then in 2019, just before all this kind of stuck,
[2:22:22.320 --> 2:22:25.200]  kind of stuck, kicked off, she stayed with her neighbor.
[2:22:25.200 --> 2:22:28.400]  Her neighbor was with her neighbor for 30 odd years,
[2:22:28.400 --> 2:22:31.280]  and the lady had fell and broken her leg,
[2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:35.400]  went into hospital and passed away with COVID.
[2:22:35.400 --> 2:22:36.880]  And we were hearing all this,
[2:22:36.880 --> 2:22:39.240]  and we wanted to protect my mom.
[2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:40.760]  And given what we were getting told,
[2:22:40.760 --> 2:22:44.120]  this virus was that bad, you know,
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:47.600]  for the last years of my mom's life, we locked her away.
[2:22:47.600 --> 2:22:51.560]  When we now realise we didn't need to, you know,
[2:22:51.560 --> 2:22:54.360]  we tried to protect, as we all have,
[2:22:54.360 --> 2:22:56.200]  the ones that we love.
[2:22:56.200 --> 2:22:57.960]  You don't want to lose your mom.
[2:22:57.960 --> 2:22:59.880]  You don't want to lose your grand.
[2:22:59.880 --> 2:23:02.360]  You don't want to lose your wife, your daughter.
[2:23:02.360 --> 2:23:04.480]  You don't want to lose your life.
[2:23:04.480 --> 2:23:06.440]  This was the narrative, and this was the way
[2:23:06.440 --> 2:23:07.720]  that we're fishing it.
[2:23:07.720 --> 2:23:12.720]  So in March, 2020, there was no reports
[2:23:13.520 --> 2:23:15.520]  and official knowledge, nothing was coming out.
[2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:17.440]  There was any problems with anything.
[2:23:17.440 --> 2:23:21.080]  In fact, that very week, the BBC and the UK government
[2:23:21.080 --> 2:23:23.560]  announced that the vaccines were safe.
[2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:26.600]  They were trying to do the right thing.
[2:23:26.600 --> 2:23:27.440]  Yeah.
[2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:30.160]  Do I regret it?
[2:23:30.160 --> 2:23:32.440]  That's something I'll always regret for the rest of my life.
[2:23:32.440 --> 2:23:35.680]  And every second of every day, I feel
[2:23:36.640 --> 2:23:38.000]  that I'll regret that for the rest of my life.
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:39.080]  I'll deal with that.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:43.160]  I can live, I can't change what's happened to me.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:48.680]  Nothing's ever gonna give me my leg, my life, my love back.
[2:23:48.680 --> 2:23:51.840]  My mediocrity, as you said earlier,
[2:23:52.920 --> 2:23:54.760]  nothing's ever gonna bring that back.
[2:23:54.760 --> 2:23:57.520]  But what I can do is I can spend the rest of the days
[2:23:57.520 --> 2:24:00.840]  that I've got fighting for justice, not just for me,
[2:24:00.840 --> 2:24:03.080]  but all the ones that don't have a voice anymore.
[2:24:03.080 --> 2:24:06.080]  The names that are in my mind that never leave me.
[2:24:07.120 --> 2:24:12.120]  Every day, Stephen, Lucy, Lisa, Linda, Stephen,
[2:24:13.720 --> 2:24:15.320]  Zeon, Tommy.
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:18.000]  I'm guessing some of those names did get the government
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:19.040]  mandated death.
[2:24:20.200 --> 2:24:23.640]  They're all tragedies, they're all fatalities.
[2:24:23.640 --> 2:24:26.720]  I know their wives, their husbands, their daughters.
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:30.760]  So it sounds to me that the answer is
[2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:33.520]  the corporate government propaganda
[2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:35.680]  is what made you want to get the vaccine
[2:24:35.680 --> 2:24:36.520]  to protect your mother,
[2:24:36.520 --> 2:24:38.520]  because that's what they were telling you.
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:41.800]  So I'm gonna have a kind of a two-pronged question
[2:24:41.800 --> 2:24:43.080]  for you here.
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:46.440]  Do you feel that you were lied to about the vaccine?
[2:24:46.440 --> 2:24:48.720]  And do you wish you would have known about these side effects
[2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:49.680]  before you took it?
[2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:53.520]  Yes, I was lied to about the vaccine.
[2:24:53.520 --> 2:24:57.200]  When we now know we can prove I was lied to the vaccine.
[2:24:57.200 --> 2:24:59.240]  The safety data that they submitted
[2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:01.680]  to report the UK health regulatory
[2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:05.160]  and the FDA was the same data.
[2:25:05.160 --> 2:25:10.040]  The FDA rejected an emergency license on the grounds
[2:25:10.040 --> 2:25:15.040]  that the data was incomplete, incorrect and outdated.
[2:25:15.040 --> 2:25:18.080]  Yet the UK government went ahead with it.
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:21.200]  Now, even if the UK government didn't know at that point,
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:24.760]  surely when the FDA rejected the emergency use of it,
[2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:27.520]  that would have made them aware
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:29.560]  that there was a problem with the data,
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:31.280]  yet they still went ahead.
[2:25:31.280 --> 2:25:33.760]  There was no issues of side effects.
[2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:36.200]  On the 20th of March, 2020,
[2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:39.280]  the sum total of the side effects I was told were,
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:41.480]  and this was verbally, not in a leaflet,
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:44.680]  not in a written form, this was verbally,
[2:25:44.680 --> 2:25:47.840]  you may have a suicide area for a couple of days
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:51.920]  and you may have cold or full light symptoms for 48 hours.
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:55.640]  That's the sum total of the side effects I was told.
[2:25:55.640 --> 2:25:59.400]  If I was made aware that there was clotting issues,
[2:25:59.400 --> 2:26:02.640]  if I was made aware that in reality,
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:04.480]  having no underlying health conditions
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:08.400]  being supremely fit because I was a steel erector
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:11.800]  and I carried a lot of very manual physical job,
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:14.720]  there's no necessity for me to take a vaccine.
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:19.720]  I would have survived the virus, it's a 1% fatality rate
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:22.600]  at my level of fitness and health.
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:27.600]  So yes, they have been lied to, not just the UK,
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:31.800]  governments all around the world have lied to lots of people.
[2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:35.720]  And the problem we've got is that I may have a voice
[2:26:35.720 --> 2:26:38.680]  and I can scream from the rooftops,
[2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:42.320]  but unless the public around the world
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:46.480]  surrounded us and supported us,
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:49.880]  go on to your politicians, go on to your MPs,
[2:26:49.880 --> 2:26:52.480]  go on to your rulers, make them aware,
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:55.360]  these issues are not going to go away.
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:26:58.680]  Now the numbers I gave you were forfeit only in the UK,
[2:26:58.680 --> 2:27:01.520]  was not even touched on myocarditis,
[2:27:01.520 --> 2:27:06.320]  pyocarditis, belt palsy, Guillain's Barry syndrome.
[2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:09.520]  The list goes on and on and on and on.
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:11.320]  Yeah, there was just a list of,
[2:27:11.320 --> 2:27:13.840]  it's almost a thousand athletes now
[2:27:13.840 --> 2:27:17.000]  that have had heart attacks or blood clots or died,
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:19.280]  post-vaccine, almost a thousand athletes,
[2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:21.200]  I think the number was just 800,
[2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:24.360]  a thousand of them on record, post-vaccine, side effects,
[2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:28.640]  many have died, average age 23, 23.
[2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:32.040]  So Alex, let me just ask you this in closing
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:34.080]  and I've only got 60 seconds left
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:35.440]  and I thank you for coming on air with us
[2:27:35.440 --> 2:27:37.480]  and we ask you just God speed
[2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:38.920]  and God bless you in your journey.
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:41.760]  How has this experienced changed your worldview?
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:46.880]  My worldview is that I still believe
[2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:51.600]  that out of the 6.7 billion people on this planet,
[2:27:52.640 --> 2:27:57.600]  95 to 90% of them are good, hardworking, loving people
[2:27:57.600 --> 2:27:59.120]  who want to do the right thing.
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:01.880]  My views haven't changed, I'm still a positive guy,
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:05.200]  this won't change me, I'll fight,
[2:28:05.200 --> 2:28:07.160]  but it won't change me.
[2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:08.600]  Thank you very much for having me,
[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:11.880]  thanking you for allowing me to speak my voice
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:14.320]  and I hope that people will listen.
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:17.680]  If I can save one life, that's enough for me.
[2:28:18.920 --> 2:28:20.320]  Thank you everyone.
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:22.800]  Well, thank you and again, we just,
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:24.800]  we say God speed to you and your journey
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:26.440]  and the connections that you're making there
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:29.800]  and your fight against the government that,
[2:28:29.800 --> 2:28:32.320]  their propaganda, the corporate propaganda,
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:34.680]  the government propaganda force you to take this vaccine,
[2:28:34.680 --> 2:28:36.400]  it's all to your life and now they just don't care.
[2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:38.080]  They just throw you off the scrap heap
[2:28:38.080 --> 2:28:39.720]  like they don't care about you
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:41.880]  and folks, I just don't want to see this happen anymore.
[2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:44.760]  I'm sick of it, this is not how human life is meant to be.
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:47.880]  Let's just call it what it is, folks.
[2:28:47.880 --> 2:28:50.600]  Government intervention is just evil, it just is.
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:52.720]  Government intervention is just evil
[2:28:52.720 --> 2:28:54.640]  and you know what, this is what happens
[2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:56.160]  when you let it happen, folks.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:28:59.680]  It was about 25 years ago
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:01.200]  that I wanted to expand in for worse.
[2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:02.320]  I've been on the air a couple of years
[2:29:02.320 --> 2:29:04.880]  but I only had money to finance my own
[2:29:04.880 --> 2:29:06.720]  simple little local radio show
[2:29:06.720 --> 2:29:07.920]  and I wanted to hire camera people,
[2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:08.800]  I wanted to make films,
[2:29:08.800 --> 2:29:11.160]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist
[2:29:11.160 --> 2:29:12.600]  and it was a t-shirt I designed.
[2:29:12.600 --> 2:29:16.400]  The first one, mass murderers agree, gun control works
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:19.960]  that helped us finance hiring the first members of my crew.
[2:29:19.960 --> 2:29:22.400]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling.
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:24.680]  We have that design over a hundred others
[2:29:24.680 --> 2:29:26.560]  that will now all be limited to issues
[2:29:26.560 --> 2:29:28.280]  because whatever stock we've got in,
[2:29:28.280 --> 2:29:31.080]  that's it, we're selling everything out
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:33.680]  to fund the operation, to get rid of inventory.
[2:29:33.680 --> 2:29:35.240]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future,
[2:29:35.240 --> 2:29:37.440]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:39.880]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts,
[2:29:39.880 --> 2:29:42.320]  this is your last chance, I almost forgot.
[2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:46.000]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie,
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:51.040]  every long sleeve, every t-shirt,
[2:29:51.040 --> 2:29:52.600]  regular shirts, designer shirts,
[2:29:52.600 --> 2:29:57.040]  they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.

[2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:17.080]  that is essential and everyone should get
[2:30:17.080 --> 2:30:19.320]  and on top of it, it funds the InfoWars
[2:30:19.320 --> 2:30:20.880]  so that's the 360 win.
[2:30:20.880 --> 2:30:23.240]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[2:30:23.240 --> 2:30:26.640]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea,
[2:30:26.640 --> 2:30:29.880]  concentrated astragalus root, angelica root,

[2:30:40.440 --> 2:30:41.960]  the InfoWars operation.
[2:30:41.960 --> 2:30:43.400]  It is a 360 win.
[2:30:43.400 --> 2:30:46.160]  The only way you fail is by not taking action
[2:30:46.160 --> 2:30:49.000]  and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:50.480]  and keep InfoWars on the air.
[2:30:50.480 --> 2:30:52.800]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[2:30:52.800 --> 2:30:57.080]  Take action now, infowarstore.com.
[2:30:57.080 --> 2:30:59.720]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it,
[2:30:59.720 --> 2:31:03.320]  it's just true, that InfoWars is seen by the globalist
[2:31:03.320 --> 2:31:05.960]  as the standard of human liberty,
[2:31:05.960 --> 2:31:10.720]  as the logo of human populist resistance
[2:31:10.720 --> 2:31:14.240]  against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[2:31:14.240 --> 2:31:17.640]  And man, our work is really right now
[2:31:17.640 --> 2:31:21.440]  hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[2:31:21.440 --> 2:31:23.920]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize
[2:31:23.920 --> 2:31:27.040]  we've got great products, thousands of them,
[2:31:27.040 --> 2:31:28.280]  at infowarstore.com.

[2:31:31.320 --> 2:31:34.240]  And so now we need to support more than ever
[2:31:34.240 --> 2:31:35.880]  because this fight has intensified.
[2:31:35.880 --> 2:31:39.520]  Don't need me to tell you that at infowarstore.com.

[2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:06.560]  After years of being off the shelves,
[2:32:06.560 --> 2:32:08.240]  we're bringing back one of the biggest fan
[2:32:08.240 --> 2:32:09.680]  favorite formulas ever,
[2:32:09.680 --> 2:32:12.200]  and it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[2:32:12.200 --> 2:32:14.680]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[2:32:14.680 --> 2:32:18.280]  It's got concentrated high quality chicken broth protein,
[2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:19.880]  turmeric root that's so amazing,
[2:32:19.880 --> 2:32:23.960]  shagamush, beef pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:27.360]  then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[2:32:27.360 --> 2:32:30.520]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder

[2:32:33.920 --> 2:32:35.800]  It even tastes better than last formula,
[2:32:35.800 --> 2:32:38.560]  and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:32:38.560 --> 2:32:42.400]  Again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein,
[2:32:42.400 --> 2:32:45.760]  isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[2:32:45.760 --> 2:32:47.920]  You're gonna love this, and when it does for your joints,

[2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:13.920]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center
[2:33:13.920 --> 2:33:16.160]  and the heart of the Resistance.
[2:33:16.160 --> 2:33:19.120]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:33:20.120 --> 2:33:22.800]  And I'm joined in studio by Cody Wilson.
[2:33:22.800 --> 2:33:25.880]  He's been involved as the director of defense,
[2:33:25.880 --> 2:33:30.360]  distributed, and ghost runner for almost two decades.
[2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:34.200]  He's been fighting for your right to defend yourself
[2:33:34.200 --> 2:33:37.880]  and to a firearm, which the Biden administration
[2:33:37.880 --> 2:33:41.280]  and the Democrats are on a full out war
[2:33:41.280 --> 2:33:44.000]  to take those rights from you.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:45.560]  So we heard about yesterday,
[2:33:45.560 --> 2:33:47.880]  they're making this big deal about a ghost gun rule,
[2:33:47.880 --> 2:33:50.240]  so we wanted to get Cody Wilson in today,
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:53.280]  who's one of the pioneers of 3D gun printing,
[2:33:53.280 --> 2:33:55.440]  and one of the best advocates
[2:33:55.440 --> 2:33:57.400]  for your second amendment freedoms.
[2:33:57.400 --> 2:33:58.560]  And so he joins me here today.
[2:33:58.560 --> 2:34:02.120]  Now, Cody, just to start with what they talked about yesterday,
[2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:04.040]  what they announced yesterday,
[2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:05.960]  give it the face value report,
[2:34:05.960 --> 2:34:08.080]  but then we'll talk about what it really means.
[2:34:08.080 --> 2:34:11.080]  Yeah, you had a Rose Garden ceremony,
[2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:13.080]  Joe Biden mispronouncing the ATF's name,
[2:34:13.080 --> 2:34:14.280]  things like this, and he says.
[2:34:14.280 --> 2:34:15.800]  Oh, geez, yeah. Oh, celebration.
[2:34:15.800 --> 2:34:18.200]  Well, you know, this is some momentous gun control
[2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:19.400]  we've achieved together,
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:21.600]  a fulfillment of the promise of the march for our lives,
[2:34:21.600 --> 2:34:23.520]  the post-Parkland shooting,
[2:34:23.520 --> 2:34:25.800]  but all they really be able to boil their efforts down to
[2:34:25.800 --> 2:34:28.720]  was saying certain kits in the mail
[2:34:28.720 --> 2:34:30.720]  are now going to be included in the definition
[2:34:30.720 --> 2:34:32.760]  of firearms under the law,
[2:34:32.760 --> 2:34:35.560]  which itself isn't like an illegal rewrite of the statute.
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:37.480]  The statute literally means some things are firearms
[2:34:37.480 --> 2:34:38.320]  and some things aren't,
[2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:39.880]  so they're just trying to tuck as much as they can
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:42.240]  into a new definition of firearms,
[2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:44.520]  and they're targeting a way that people make guns at home
[2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:45.760]  with kits in the mail,
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:47.960]  but you get the sense that this is kind of a letdown
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:49.480]  for gun controllers, I think.
[2:34:49.480 --> 2:34:50.680]  Well, and in two ways.
[2:34:50.680 --> 2:34:55.360]  First of all, essentially, with this logic,
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:34:58.360]  they're going to say a 3D printer is a gun.
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:34:59.960]  I mean, you can't even have a 3D printer
[2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:00.800]  because that's a gun.
[2:35:00.800 --> 2:35:01.920]  I mean, that's essentially the same thing
[2:35:01.920 --> 2:35:02.880]  as you can't have the materials.
[2:35:02.880 --> 2:35:03.720]  That's smart.
[2:35:03.720 --> 2:35:04.760]  So today, in their rule, they say,
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:05.960]  well, of course we don't mean that,
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:06.960]  but actually if you read their rule,
[2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:08.160]  they do give themselves,
[2:35:08.160 --> 2:35:10.240]  like they equip themselves with the logic to say that.
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:12.600]  Well, if you sell a part and then some other parts,
[2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:14.120]  and depending upon the equipment and instructions
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:15.920]  you provide, maybe that is a firearm,
[2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:17.920]  which is an insane definition of a word
[2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:20.360]  which should have a normal dictionary kind of construction.
[2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:21.520]  We all know what a firearm is
[2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:22.880]  and what a firearm isn't, right?
[2:35:22.880 --> 2:35:23.960]  But they're trying to give themselves,
[2:35:23.960 --> 2:35:26.360]  if not today, for five years, 10 years down the road,
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:28.360]  the next ATF director, the next super progressive,
[2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:29.920]  the elected, maybe Kamala Harris,
[2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:31.760]  to say, well, of course I'm just regulating firearms.
[2:35:31.760 --> 2:35:32.720]  What's wrong with that?
[2:35:32.720 --> 2:35:35.240]  But she means something much larger in its scope.
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:38.960]  Yeah, and what does it really mean, though, folks?
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:43.320]  What it really means is that they want a gun registry.
[2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:45.160]  They want every gun on the record.
[2:35:45.160 --> 2:35:46.840]  They don't like you having any privacy,
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:48.000]  any private firearms.
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:49.920]  They don't like that.
[2:35:49.920 --> 2:35:51.320]  So that's the approach they take as,
[2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:54.440]  hey, we just wanna make sure we know where your guns are.
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:35:56.720]  We just wanna make sure that there's no ghost guns out there
[2:35:56.720 --> 2:35:59.080]  that we, the government, that loves you so much
[2:35:59.080 --> 2:35:59.920]  and wants you dead,
[2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:00.760]  we just wanna make sure
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:02.400]  that we have all those guns on record.
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:03.240]  And so we're gonna,
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:05.000]  so they act like it's this innocent,
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:06.480]  oh, we're just trying to help you,
[2:36:06.480 --> 2:36:07.680]  typical government approach.
[2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:10.240]  No, this is more infringement on our rights.
[2:36:10.240 --> 2:36:11.520]  They want it both ways.
[2:36:11.520 --> 2:36:14.600]  It's somehow neuro-linguistic programming to say,
[2:36:14.600 --> 2:36:16.280]  like, well, your private right to make a firearm,
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:18.320]  which you've always had since this has been a republic
[2:36:18.320 --> 2:36:20.640]  of any knowledge,
[2:36:20.640 --> 2:36:22.440]  somehow that private right is scary, right?
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:23.320]  It's, ooh, it's a ghost.
[2:36:23.320 --> 2:36:24.160]  It's spooky.
[2:36:24.160 --> 2:36:25.000]  You shouldn't do it.
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:26.760]  Look how your neighbor might have a ghost gun.
[2:36:26.760 --> 2:36:27.640]  Ooh, it's a ghost.
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:28.480]  It haunts you.
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:29.560]  Right, and it programs this idea
[2:36:29.560 --> 2:36:32.120]  that the government has this need to know,
[2:36:32.120 --> 2:36:33.120]  which, of course, it does not.
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:35.120]  We recognize our privacy interests in almost everything,
[2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:36.320]  especially our fundamental rights
[2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:38.200]  recognized by the Second Amendment.
[2:36:38.200 --> 2:36:40.960]  So it's a way of divorcing you from what it should be,
[2:36:40.960 --> 2:36:42.640]  I think, a standard traditional activity.
[2:36:42.640 --> 2:36:44.080]  If you have the right to keep and bear arms,
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:46.600]  surely you have the right to make these arms
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:47.880]  and to know how to make them.
[2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:50.440]  But they're saying, well, no, in your interest, of course,
[2:36:50.440 --> 2:36:52.120]  we'll take that away from you because safety
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:53.160]  and our police and all these things
[2:36:53.160 --> 2:36:54.040]  are so much more important.
[2:36:54.040 --> 2:36:56.960]  And like you said, don't you know we love you?
[2:36:56.960 --> 2:36:57.800]  It's just-
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:36:59.280]  As they wanna defund the police, so,
[2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:00.920]  oh, I can't defend myself because the government
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:02.720]  took my gun because they love me so much.
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:04.720]  Now a criminal's got a gun to my head.
[2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:05.760]  Let me call the cops.
[2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:07.120]  Oh, wait, the same people that took my gun
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:08.040]  defunded the police.
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:10.400]  Oh, I guess I'm just here to die now.
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:11.240]  Exactly.
[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:13.880]  There's no legitimate role for self-defense
[2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:16.000]  or especially opposition of the government
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:17.720]  if they don't have access to the serial numbers
[2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:18.680]  on those firearms.
[2:37:18.680 --> 2:37:20.480]  And as has been disclosed in other things,
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:22.520]  and I'm sure you're reporting analysis,
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:24.240]  even though the ATF is barred by statute
[2:37:24.240 --> 2:37:26.600]  from having a database of actually recording
[2:37:26.600 --> 2:37:29.800]  who has transacted in firearms and who owns what,
[2:37:29.800 --> 2:37:32.080]  they've admitted in court filings and other things
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:34.000]  that they are, in fact, building this illegal database.
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:35.080]  Yeah, we know that's a lie.
[2:37:35.080 --> 2:37:37.360]  Yeah, and of course, we should have always suspected it,
[2:37:37.360 --> 2:37:39.280]  but this is, this new rule, Biden's new rule,
[2:37:39.280 --> 2:37:41.040]  is a part of this, which is to say,
[2:37:41.040 --> 2:37:43.800]  there will be nothing outside of these tables
[2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:45.880]  of registered firearms with serial numbers,
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:47.600]  which, by the way, we're secretly recording.
[2:37:47.600 --> 2:37:48.600]  There will be nothing outside of it.
[2:37:48.600 --> 2:37:50.120]  We're not recording, but by the way,
[2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:51.560]  here's all the paperwork so we can record it.
[2:37:51.560 --> 2:37:52.400]  Right, exactly.
[2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:54.840]  And the ATF has even admitted to not just its public guidance,
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:37:56.960]  which is insane and arcane and you can't get through it all.
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:38:00.280]  Even yesterday's rule is something like 364 pages.
[2:38:00.280 --> 2:38:01.120]  Good luck.
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:02.720]  But beyond that, the ATF admits
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:04.960]  that it has even secret guidance underneath this.
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:07.520]  So even if you could get through the 364 pages,
[2:38:07.520 --> 2:38:09.240]  there's the guidance that they don't even show you.
[2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:13.040]  And let's take this down the field a little bit.
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:14.560]  What are they really afraid of?
[2:38:14.560 --> 2:38:17.400]  Well, the corrupt government that wants you dead,
[2:38:17.400 --> 2:38:19.240]  of course they don't want you to have a firearm
[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:20.480]  when they come to kill you.
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:22.400]  They want you to lay down and die.
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:23.240]  Don't you get it?
[2:38:23.240 --> 2:38:24.960]  It's because we love you so much.
[2:38:24.960 --> 2:38:26.760]  But I found this amazing and this is where,
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:29.760]  this is one of the more frustrating things where I just,
[2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:32.440]  I wish more people could think logically
[2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:34.360]  and reach logical conclusions
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:35.320]  as to where all this goes.
[2:38:35.320 --> 2:38:37.880]  Like for example, one thing Biden said
[2:38:37.880 --> 2:38:40.560]  leading up to the election was,
[2:38:40.560 --> 2:38:42.160]  because the Democrats have really become
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:44.920]  anti-second amendment now, it's party policy,
[2:38:44.920 --> 2:38:49.280]  is hey, you know, not everyone was allowed to own a gun
[2:38:49.280 --> 2:38:51.800]  in 1776, not everyone was allowed to own a gun.
[2:38:51.800 --> 2:38:52.640]  Really?
[2:38:52.640 --> 2:38:53.480]  Okay.
[2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:54.680]  Who wasn't allowed to own a gun?
[2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:56.000]  Oh, slaves.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:56.840]  That's right.
[2:38:56.840 --> 2:38:58.160]  Slaves weren't allowed to own a gun.
[2:38:58.160 --> 2:38:59.840]  So they want to make all of us slaves.
[2:38:59.840 --> 2:39:02.440]  But here's like their new, here's their new buzzword.
[2:39:02.440 --> 2:39:04.840]  Biden claims second amendment didn't say
[2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:07.040]  you can own any gun you want.
[2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:08.440]  No, you're right.
[2:39:08.440 --> 2:39:10.640]  You know what the constitution is
[2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:12.080]  and the Bill of Rights is,
[2:39:12.080 --> 2:39:15.840]  it's to protect us from the government.
[2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:18.440]  They seem to have forgotten this, Cody.
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:20.240]  It's a willful ignorance.
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:21.720]  It's a malicious ignorance.
[2:39:21.720 --> 2:39:24.080]  And obviously, when I see the government
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:26.840]  defending, let's say restrictions on fire and ownership,
[2:39:26.840 --> 2:39:27.760]  they go, well, historically,
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:28.960]  we've always had these restrictions.
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:31.640]  And as you mentioned, these all come from
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:35.800]  post-Civil War, or let's say slave code regulations,
[2:39:35.800 --> 2:39:37.480]  where there were literally disfavored classes
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:39.120]  of people who weren't allowed to own farms.
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:40.720]  That's not what we mean.
[2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:42.720]  And that doesn't mean that's traditional
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:43.960]  or that's for a lawful purpose.
[2:39:43.960 --> 2:39:46.280]  The right to keep and bear arms is absolute
[2:39:46.280 --> 2:39:47.480]  and it shall not be infringed.
[2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:48.840]  It's in the text.
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:51.720]  And of course, it's being infringed upon every day.
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:54.840]  But that's what I'm saying is they're able to get away.
[2:39:54.840 --> 2:39:55.680]  It's the same thing they say,
[2:39:55.680 --> 2:39:57.600]  oh, the virus shut down the school,
[2:39:57.600 --> 2:40:00.680]  the virus shut down the, no, the government did that.
[2:40:00.680 --> 2:40:02.040]  That's not a damn virus.
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:03.600]  No virus came to the school and said,
[2:40:03.600 --> 2:40:05.520]  you gotta shut down now, sorry, I'm here
[2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:06.360]  and I'm taking over.
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:07.760]  No, the government did that.
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:08.600]  So it's the same thing.
[2:40:08.600 --> 2:40:11.160]  They always wanna put blame on something else,
[2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:12.960]  somewhere else, when it's them doing it.
[2:40:12.960 --> 2:40:14.640]  The Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment,
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:17.000]  is to protect us from the government.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:18.800]  And now they've somehow flipped it to say,
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:21.600]  well, the government says not everybody's allowed
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:23.960]  a gun, slaves, and the government says,
[2:40:23.960 --> 2:40:25.320]  well, the Second Amendment doesn't say
[2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:26.840]  you can have any gun you want.
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:28.680]  Well, that's not for them to decide.
[2:40:28.680 --> 2:40:29.520]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:30.960]  So if anything, the Second Amendment is clearly built
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:34.480]  to protect military-grade weapons of the Revolutionary Era
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:36.440]  for this structural purpose of militia defense,
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:37.800]  of the freeholders or something.
[2:40:37.800 --> 2:40:39.320]  So if anything, the Second Amendment's about
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:41.240]  having the cannons and things that Joe Biden says
[2:40:41.240 --> 2:40:43.160]  you shouldn't have and not having handguns.
[2:40:43.160 --> 2:40:45.160]  And so everything has slowly kind of flipped
[2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:47.320]  in the many generations since then.
[2:40:47.320 --> 2:40:49.000]  And there's all these absurdities for that reason.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.640]  But this ghost-gun conversation, specifically,
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:53.760]  to your point, seems to be about reversing
[2:40:53.760 --> 2:40:54.960]  the standard of care to say,
[2:40:54.960 --> 2:40:56.520]  well, doesn't the government have a right
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:40:58.440]  to be defended against all you evil gun owners
[2:40:58.440 --> 2:40:59.760]  that we don't know about?
[2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:02.320]  The answer is very plainly, no.
[2:41:02.320 --> 2:41:04.560]  So that's what my next question was going to be.
[2:41:04.560 --> 2:41:06.560]  What do you think this ghost-gun,
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:10.040]  because clearly they want that to be in your mind now.
[2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:12.040]  The whole term ghost-gun, that's the buzzword
[2:41:12.040 --> 2:41:12.880]  that they've chosen.
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:14.680]  They're probably thinking tanks, focus groups,
[2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:16.160]  decide ghost-gun is what we're going with.
[2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:17.280]  That's right.
[2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:21.120]  Should it be villain-gun or ghost-gun or maybe black-gun?
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:22.160]  Oh, that might be racist.
[2:41:22.160 --> 2:41:25.320]  So what do you think the real motive
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:27.800]  of pushing this whole ghost-gun thing is right now?
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:29.400]  Honestly, man, I think this is a little bit
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:30.480]  of emperor-wares, no clothes.
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:33.800]  Like they're spinning what they can out of almost nothing.
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:36.560]  Because the ghost-gun settlement, this problem,
[2:41:36.560 --> 2:41:38.720]  affects less than 1% of crime guns,
[2:41:38.720 --> 2:41:40.760]  less than 1% of murders, or any of the things
[2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:43.040]  that like when Joe goes to New York to deal with a new mayor
[2:41:43.040 --> 2:41:44.880]  and say, hey, I'm going to somehow tamp down
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:46.400]  on the double murder rate that we've had
[2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:47.360]  in the last 18 months.
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:49.280]  Which is going to double again this year, possibly?
[2:41:49.280 --> 2:41:50.120]  Exactly.
[2:41:50.120 --> 2:41:52.840]  Ghost-guns are vanishingly almost infinitely small part
[2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:55.200]  of that problem, like nothing, statistically nothing,
[2:41:55.200 --> 2:41:56.120]  no part of that problem.
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:41:59.560]  And so because you can't achieve some meaningful settlement
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:01.520]  or compromise for the crime problem, which
[2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:03.560]  is something that they own and encourage, right,
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:05.080]  with their shock troops and the cities,
[2:42:05.080 --> 2:42:07.160]  and you've seen it in January, of course.
[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:10.120]  They want to arm Ukrainians all day long, but not you.
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:13.400]  They literally are about like sowing this division and its
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:14.960]  armed conflict in our country and others.
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:17.080]  And of course, when they can't deal with that problem,
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:18.800]  they have to point to the lawful gun owner
[2:42:18.800 --> 2:42:20.680]  and say, well, something about your freedom here
[2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:22.120]  that we haven't addressed is the problem,
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:24.520]  and therefore we've solved it, and therefore we're not
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:25.240]  to blame.
[2:42:25.240 --> 2:42:26.800]  And there's two levels of this.
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:30.280]  There's the control freaks who are just petty control freak
[2:42:30.280 --> 2:42:33.480]  douchebags who just love getting involved in your life
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:34.920]  and telling you what to do, so they just
[2:42:34.920 --> 2:42:36.720]  want to control your life and take your guns.
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:40.040]  But then there's the elites that don't want you to be armed
[2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:43.120]  because they look at you as slaves, commodities, bugs
[2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:44.280]  that if they want to kill, they want
[2:42:44.280 --> 2:42:47.080]  to be able to kill nice and easily.
[2:42:47.080 --> 2:42:49.760]  But that's why they get so panicked is, oh my gosh,
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:51.440]  you might be able to make a gun at home,
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:52.840]  and I don't know about it.
[2:42:52.840 --> 2:42:54.080]  I can't stand that.
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:54.840]  I'm the government.
[2:42:54.840 --> 2:42:55.520]  I'm a lefty.
[2:42:55.520 --> 2:42:58.240]  I need to control your life.
[2:42:58.240 --> 2:43:02.640]  Over the years, Info Wars has produced more than 200
[2:43:02.640 --> 2:43:06.600]  amazing, patriot Americana, Second Amendment pro-liberty
[2:43:06.600 --> 2:43:10.000]  themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags.
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:10.680]  You name it.
[2:43:10.680 --> 2:43:12.560]  All of the apparel and the flags
[2:43:12.560 --> 2:43:14.600]  are being sold at cost right now.
[2:43:14.600 --> 2:43:17.120]  That's just regular plain-jane shirts.
[2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:20.560]  That is all sorts of designer shirts
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:23.080]  that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[2:43:23.080 --> 2:43:25.640]  We used to sell for $40, we're selling them for $15,
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:27.800]  selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs us.
[2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:30.640]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:31.880]  for us to actually produce.
[2:43:31.880 --> 2:43:33.960]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:36.280]  And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves,
[2:43:36.280 --> 2:43:37.320]  and we've got short sleeves.
[2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:39.680]  We've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all.
[2:43:39.680 --> 2:43:42.480]  And they're limited edition because we're never
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:44.880]  going to make any of these designs again.
[2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:47.280]  We are going to come out with some new designs that
[2:43:47.280 --> 2:43:49.840]  will be limited, limited edition in the future.
[2:43:49.840 --> 2:43:52.080]  We've got to sell this to keep Info Wars on the air,
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:54.800]  plus it spreads the word, infowarstore.com.
[2:43:54.800 --> 2:43:58.720]  Here, historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:04.280]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing,
[2:44:04.280 --> 2:44:09.120]  the mind control, the asleep prince,
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:12.840]  that the general public is in, the best word would actually
[2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:15.760]  be the people are lost.
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:19.600]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare,
[2:44:19.600 --> 2:44:23.000]  you're in a horror, you get knocked out, and you've lost
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:28.680]  your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:30.040]  You have a concussion.
[2:44:30.040 --> 2:44:31.440]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:33.440]  They have stunned us.
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:36.720]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:38.880]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech.
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:40.720]  He called The Great New Narrative,
[2:44:40.720 --> 2:44:43.000]  where he brags how the public is lost,
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:46.280]  how the culture and the media has been driven to make sure
[2:44:46.280 --> 2:44:48.320]  that people are all alone so they can now
[2:44:48.320 --> 2:44:50.600]  guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:52.240]  That's what The Great Recent is.
[2:44:52.240 --> 2:44:53.880]  They need darkness to thrive.
[2:44:53.880 --> 2:44:57.640]  Light lives at infowars.com.
[2:44:57.640 --> 2:45:02.240]  Introducing the newest product from infowarslife.com.
[2:45:02.240 --> 2:45:05.720]  We are so proud of infowarslife immune support.
[2:45:05.720 --> 2:45:09.520]  It is concentrated herbs that are known on record
[2:45:09.520 --> 2:45:13.360]  to supercharge our body's natural defenses.
[2:45:13.360 --> 2:45:16.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is essential
[2:45:16.200 --> 2:45:17.680]  and everyone should get.
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:19.920]  And on top of it, it funds the info war,
[2:45:19.920 --> 2:45:21.480]  so that's a 360 win.
[2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:23.840]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[2:45:23.840 --> 2:45:27.240]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea,
[2:45:27.240 --> 2:45:30.480]  concentrated astragalus root, angelica root,
[2:45:30.480 --> 2:45:32.880]  loatium root, and more.
[2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:34.680]  This product is incredible.
[2:45:34.680 --> 2:45:37.880]  InfoWars immune support, exclusively available
[2:45:37.880 --> 2:45:41.040]  at infowarsstore.com, is funding the tip of the spear,
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:42.560]  the info wars operation.
[2:45:42.560 --> 2:45:44.000]  It is a 360 win.
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:46.760]  The only way you fail is by not taking action
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:49.640]  to get in this product, to boost your body's natural defenses
[2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:51.080]  and keep info wars on the air.
[2:45:51.080 --> 2:45:53.400]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:55.920]  Take action now, infowarsstore.com.
[2:45:58.120 --> 2:46:00.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[2:46:00.080 --> 2:46:03.520]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[2:46:03.520 --> 2:46:07.520]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:09.560]  I was born for this, you were born for this,
[2:46:09.560 --> 2:46:12.160]  and people are really waking up right now,
[2:46:12.160 --> 2:46:14.600]  but we had to build our own infrastructure
[2:46:14.600 --> 2:46:17.160]  because of the censorship and deplatforming
[2:46:17.160 --> 2:46:18.760]  that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:21.080]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:23.640]  to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[2:46:23.640 --> 2:46:26.960]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups
[2:46:26.960 --> 2:46:30.280]  to be able to post their content free of charge.
[2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:34.960]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:38.320]  InfoWars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership
[2:46:38.320 --> 2:46:41.200]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide,
[2:46:41.200 --> 2:46:44.880]  with the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars
[2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:47.360]  a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars
[2:46:47.360 --> 2:46:48.200]  a month.
[2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:50.880]  So, the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now,
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:54.040]  the mega emergency blowout sale, up to 75% off,
[2:46:54.040 --> 2:46:57.400]  getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:03.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[2:47:03.320 --> 2:47:05.160]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:05.160 --> 2:47:10.160]  It's great to have Cody Wilson in the studio.
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:14.240]  We should get you on again soon
[2:47:14.240 --> 2:47:15.920]  because you're just a great in-studio guest.
[2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:19.080]  You're so busy today, we've only got two segments with you.
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:22.360]  But a couple things that I want to get to before we let you go.
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:25.920]  What do you think they're doing?
[2:47:25.920 --> 2:47:27.920]  They're doing a great job, they're doing a great job.
[2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:29.920]  They're doing a great job, they're doing a great job.
[2:47:29.920 --> 2:47:32.920]  They're doing a great job, they're doing a great job.
[2:47:32.920 --> 2:47:36.640]  What do you think this is going to do for the idea?
[2:47:36.640 --> 2:47:39.480]  Because you were mentioning it, ghost guns or 3D printed guns,
[2:47:39.480 --> 2:47:41.880]  it's like 0% of crime even?
[2:47:41.880 --> 2:47:44.160]  I mean, it's like, I don't even sure if it registers.
[2:47:44.160 --> 2:47:47.560]  What do you think this is going to do to the concept
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:49.600]  or the idea of what they're calling, quote unquote,
[2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:51.960]  ghost guns or 3D printed guns?
[2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:55.480]  Because every time the Democrats push for more gun control,
[2:47:55.480 --> 2:47:59.200]  more legislation to infringe upon the Second Amendment rights,
[2:47:59.200 --> 2:48:02.280]  they just become the biggest gun salesman in human history.
[2:48:02.280 --> 2:48:05.280]  I mean, don't you think this is only going to promote the idea?
[2:48:05.280 --> 2:48:06.640]  Well, we saw that, in fact, yesterday.
[2:48:06.640 --> 2:48:10.800]  Polymer80, which was the primary corporate target of Joe's new rule,
[2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:13.080]  the Polymer80 kits, they completely sold out yesterday.
[2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:15.400]  I'm a man that has something like a million dollars in sales
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:16.000]  like in a day.
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:18.680]  They couldn't have had a marketing campaign work any better.
[2:48:18.680 --> 2:48:21.560]  Exactly, and you know it's always going to be like this.
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:24.520]  Obama famously sold record sales for the gun industry,
[2:48:24.520 --> 2:48:27.080]  but it's the same thing at our company, Ghost Gunner.
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:28.600]  It's the same thing at GhostGuns.com.
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:30.720]  I mean, everybody's selling out, everybody wants kits,
[2:48:30.720 --> 2:48:33.840]  and there's rules like this take many months to come into effect
[2:48:33.840 --> 2:48:36.280]  because they're afraid of lawsuits, there's APA guidance.
[2:48:36.280 --> 2:48:39.760]  So this rule doesn't even become law for, let's say, 120 days.
[2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:41.600]  So what do you think is going to happen in the meantime?
[2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:43.680]  Just kit after kit after kit.
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:45.960]  And it's like the liberals, in a sense, understand this.
[2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:47.840]  They know that they're not even removing the problem,
[2:48:47.840 --> 2:48:50.200]  and every year, henceforth, it's like an evergreen issue.
[2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:54.120]  They can say, oh, those nasty private guns, and Americans
[2:48:54.120 --> 2:48:56.080]  who insist on building guns outside these,
[2:48:56.080 --> 2:48:57.880]  we've got to tamp down harder.
[2:48:57.880 --> 2:49:00.000]  They'll continue to invent ways to solve a fake problem
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:01.480]  with fake solution.
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:03.320]  And here's my thing.
[2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:07.160]  It's not logic if it cannot be applied universally.
[2:49:07.160 --> 2:49:08.480]  Then it's illogic.
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:11.840]  So their whole approach to guns is illogical.
[2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:14.840]  If I go out and I beat somebody to death
[2:49:14.840 --> 2:49:17.360]  with a Louisville Slugger baseball bat,
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:20.000]  nobody's going to go to the baseball bat manufacturing
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:23.800]  company or who provided the wood to the baseball,
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:25.960]  or maybe they'll go and look at a pine tree,
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:28.120]  and they'll say, screw you, pine tree,
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:31.120]  you caused this person to die from a baseball bat death.
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:32.120]  That's insane.
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:34.360]  But that's the approach they take to guns.
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:36.560]  They say, oh, we got to go after the manufacturers.
[2:49:36.560 --> 2:49:39.160]  We got to go after the supplies for all the materials
[2:49:39.160 --> 2:49:39.880]  and everything.
[2:49:39.880 --> 2:49:41.080]  And so they try to shut it down.
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:44.280]  That's their logic with guns, but not with anything else.
[2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:50.000]  I could go buy a kiln and some clay and mold myself
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:55.040]  like a cleave or something and go beat somebody with a cleave.
[2:49:55.040 --> 2:49:59.160]  Oh, we've got a band, we've got a band pottery and clay
[2:49:59.160 --> 2:49:59.760]  and kilns.
[2:49:59.760 --> 2:50:01.560]  I mean, of course, nobody would ever say that.
[2:50:01.560 --> 2:50:04.000]  But that would be their logic applied equally.
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:05.760]  That's how you know it's not logical.
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:07.680]  To be fair, of course, this is all in bad faith.
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:09.880]  We all know gun control is about this bad faith
[2:50:09.880 --> 2:50:12.680]  effort to remove a certain political structural veto
[2:50:12.680 --> 2:50:14.920]  power that the American public holds on government,
[2:50:14.920 --> 2:50:17.520]  or at least to make that government less afraid of us,
[2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:20.440]  which is a bad idea and not very Republican.
[2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:22.840]  As my co-founder Benjamin Denio likes to say,
[2:50:22.840 --> 2:50:24.840]  if you murder someone with an axe and do your time
[2:50:24.840 --> 2:50:26.280]  when you get out of jail, that next day
[2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:28.800]  you can go to the store and buy an axe.
[2:50:28.800 --> 2:50:30.480]  Or make an axe, you know?
[2:50:30.480 --> 2:50:33.520]  Sure, ghost axes.
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:36.760]  Yes, ghosts with double hatchets running around.
[2:50:36.760 --> 2:50:38.840]  To be fair, though, some progressives are more insane,
[2:50:38.840 --> 2:50:39.960]  but consistent than others.
[2:50:39.960 --> 2:50:41.920]  And so like the Eternal Anglo in the UK,
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:43.680]  they do actually want to ban knives.
[2:50:43.680 --> 2:50:46.120]  They have many ban knives, yeah.
[2:50:46.120 --> 2:50:48.280]  Like let's not pursue them to be that.
[2:50:48.280 --> 2:50:49.840]  It's like, well, how am I supposed to eat a steak?
[2:50:49.840 --> 2:50:51.440]  Well, you got two hands, pick it up, man.
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:52.080]  No, you pick it.
[2:50:52.080 --> 2:50:53.960]  Why wouldn't you eat it with your hands?
[2:50:53.960 --> 2:50:55.760]  Don't you care about public safety?
[2:50:55.760 --> 2:50:58.880]  So I don't want to chase them on hypocrisy.
[2:50:58.880 --> 2:51:00.840]  It's just interesting to note what they do and why,
[2:51:00.840 --> 2:51:02.080]  which is they don't actually want
[2:51:02.080 --> 2:51:03.640]  to solve the gun crime problem.
[2:51:03.640 --> 2:51:05.520]  Because if anything, it's in their interest
[2:51:05.520 --> 2:51:07.160]  to sow this kind of demographic collapse
[2:51:07.160 --> 2:51:11.000]  and this tendency to make our public and metropolitan spaces
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:12.400]  completely unsafe to visit.
[2:51:12.400 --> 2:51:13.840]  And it is interesting, like you pointed out
[2:51:13.840 --> 2:51:16.400]  in the previous segment, senators like, let's say,
[2:51:16.400 --> 2:51:18.520]  Blumenthal, who's like a chairman of the Armed Services
[2:51:18.520 --> 2:51:20.720]  Committee, is exactly the same strident senator who
[2:51:20.720 --> 2:51:23.400]  would say, no, public possession of assault
[2:51:23.400 --> 2:51:25.400]  rifles can be permitted under the Second Amendment.
[2:51:25.400 --> 2:51:26.720]  But he's the very same man that says
[2:51:26.720 --> 2:51:29.280]  we have to give AK-47s to every Ukrainian citizen
[2:51:29.280 --> 2:51:30.640]  in the name of freedom.
[2:51:30.640 --> 2:51:32.880]  And it's not even a secret.
[2:51:32.880 --> 2:51:35.320]  They know it's just random citizens walking up,
[2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:36.560]  joining the Ukrainian army.
[2:51:36.560 --> 2:51:36.880]  Of course.
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:39.160]  It's all, again, like Aaron McIntyre says on Twitter,
[2:51:39.160 --> 2:51:40.800]  it'll be a shame when progressists forget
[2:51:40.800 --> 2:51:43.160]  that their internationalism borders and assault
[2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:44.560]  weapons to protect democracy.
[2:51:44.560 --> 2:51:46.240]  Yeah, no, that's only in Ukraine.
[2:51:46.240 --> 2:51:47.320]  That's only in Ukraine.
[2:51:47.320 --> 2:51:48.440]  They're not interested in that.
[2:51:48.440 --> 2:51:49.560]  Democracy for you.
[2:51:49.560 --> 2:51:50.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:51:50.440 --> 2:51:53.080]  But Biden said a big lie yesterday.
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:55.120]  But I want to get your response to this.
[2:51:55.120 --> 2:51:57.840]  He said, after fumbling and bumbling through the words,
[2:51:57.840 --> 2:52:01.400]  so I'm having to do some editing here, but he said,
[2:52:01.400 --> 2:52:03.280]  imagine if the tobacco industry had
[2:52:03.280 --> 2:52:05.280]  been immune to being sued.
[2:52:05.280 --> 2:52:07.760]  He went on a word fumble, bumblemouth thing.
[2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:09.880]  But that's what he was saying.
[2:52:09.880 --> 2:52:10.720]  Is that true?
[2:52:10.720 --> 2:52:13.880]  Are gun, is the gun industry or gun manufacturers,
[2:52:13.880 --> 2:52:15.480]  are they immune to being sued?
[2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:17.520]  There is a special statute called the PLACA,
[2:52:17.520 --> 2:52:20.320]  which protects arms manufacturers against certain kinds
[2:52:20.320 --> 2:52:23.480]  of liability, like the use of their products and crimes,
[2:52:23.480 --> 2:52:27.000]  which Congress expected in 2005 was a, I don't know,
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:28.520]  it is a kind of unique protection.
[2:52:28.520 --> 2:52:30.040]  But it is not true to say that there
[2:52:30.040 --> 2:52:33.320]  aren't products liability, expectations, and other things
[2:52:33.320 --> 2:52:33.880]  in this industry.
[2:52:33.880 --> 2:52:34.440]  That's a lie.
[2:52:34.440 --> 2:52:36.600]  So he's kind of conflating the two problems.
[2:52:36.600 --> 2:52:38.400]  It is true that the gun industry is protected
[2:52:38.400 --> 2:52:41.120]  against certain kinds of bad faith litigation,
[2:52:41.120 --> 2:52:42.480]  before this very reason, because there's
[2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:44.840]  so many progressive people in the movement, which
[2:52:44.840 --> 2:52:47.240]  they have all this bad faith, and they want to have a hand
[2:52:47.240 --> 2:52:50.720]  in making and telling people how to make firearms.
[2:52:50.720 --> 2:52:52.080]  And so you mentioned big tobacco.
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:54.640]  That is actually the approach of every town, Giffords,
[2:52:54.640 --> 2:52:56.280]  all the Bloomberg controlled entities right now.
[2:52:56.280 --> 2:52:58.520]  They eventually want it to be just like big tobacco.
[2:52:58.520 --> 2:53:00.680]  They want it to be illegal to advertise firearms
[2:53:00.680 --> 2:53:03.080]  on public airways, in private media.
[2:53:03.080 --> 2:53:05.760]  And they want to basically specify and put not just
[2:53:05.760 --> 2:53:08.080]  that orange tip that you remember from your childhood,
[2:53:08.080 --> 2:53:10.440]  but they want to put safety devices and crowd all this other
[2:53:10.440 --> 2:53:13.360]  things into firearms to where eventually all you'll be able
[2:53:13.360 --> 2:53:15.560]  to have at home is, let me make a 22 handgun
[2:53:15.560 --> 2:53:18.400]  that you can walk away in a cabinet at the police department.
[2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:21.520]  And your bullets have to be like a mile away or something?
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:21.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:53:21.920 --> 2:53:22.600]  Like a standard.
[2:53:22.600 --> 2:53:23.840]  You can actually, you know what?
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:25.640]  You can have one muzzle loader in your house.
[2:53:25.640 --> 2:53:26.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:53:26.320 --> 2:53:27.440]  You can have one muzzle loader.
[2:53:27.440 --> 2:53:27.920]  Fight it.
[2:53:27.920 --> 2:53:28.040]  Fight it.
[2:53:28.040 --> 2:53:31.080]  Cut it down with all these false public safety concern,
[2:53:31.080 --> 2:53:33.200]  product liability concern, over and over and over.
[2:53:33.200 --> 2:53:34.040]  And they're a playbook.
[2:53:34.040 --> 2:53:36.760]  They've mentioned this in symposia at New York University
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:38.280]  School of Law and other places.
[2:53:38.280 --> 2:53:39.400]  This is all in the public.
[2:53:39.400 --> 2:53:41.920]  They're going to follow this big tobacco 1990s approach,
[2:53:41.920 --> 2:53:44.840]  where they're just going to do big, like the, oh god,
[2:53:44.840 --> 2:53:47.560]  what was it, the Winchester suit, the Sandy Hook shooting,
[2:53:47.560 --> 2:53:48.680]  the other one.
[2:53:48.680 --> 2:53:49.800]  Winchester Remington.
[2:53:49.800 --> 2:53:51.000]  It was a Remington suit, that's right.
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:52.520]  And they forced that big settlement with Remington,
[2:53:52.520 --> 2:53:53.600]  because Remington went bankrupt.
[2:53:53.600 --> 2:53:54.560]  That was a huge problem.
[2:53:54.560 --> 2:53:55.520]  And they're going to continue to suit
[2:53:55.520 --> 2:53:56.640]  every single manufacturer.
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:53:59.600]  And by the way, they're taking that as basically
[2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:02.720]  a protocol or a standard of how they want to go after other
[2:54:02.720 --> 2:54:03.920]  companies they want shut down.
[2:54:03.920 --> 2:54:04.280]  That's it.
[2:54:04.280 --> 2:54:05.400]  So they're showing you their playbook.
[2:54:05.400 --> 2:54:07.720]  And I imagine until there's meaningful resistance
[2:54:07.720 --> 2:54:09.840]  or a major like SIG actually defeats them in court,
[2:54:09.840 --> 2:54:10.760]  they're going to keep doing that.
[2:54:10.760 --> 2:54:12.920]  They're even sponsoring lawsuits from foreign countries,
[2:54:12.920 --> 2:54:15.960]  like Mexico. So because there's so much gun crime in Mexico,
[2:54:15.960 --> 2:54:17.520]  they're actually sponsoring Mexico as a plaintiff
[2:54:17.520 --> 2:54:20.560]  and suing the major manufacturers.
[2:54:20.560 --> 2:54:22.480]  By the way, you're just looking at some of these,
[2:54:22.480 --> 2:54:24.280]  I guess these are considered ghost guns
[2:54:24.280 --> 2:54:26.000]  by the Biden administration.
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:26.560]  Yeah.
[2:54:26.560 --> 2:54:28.120]  These look like Polymer 80 kits.
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:30.200]  And of course, that lowered there on that handgun
[2:54:30.200 --> 2:54:31.360]  may have been printed.
[2:54:31.360 --> 2:54:31.560]  Yeah.
[2:54:31.560 --> 2:54:32.880]  In fact, it very likely was.
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:35.280]  But that's just the thing about these ghost gun rags.
[2:54:35.280 --> 2:54:36.880]  Maybe they ban Polymer 80 kits.
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:39.960]  But of course, it's completely simple, almost impossibly
[2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:41.800]  easy to just print the very same thing.
[2:54:41.800 --> 2:54:44.040]  Yeah, they'll have to ban 3D printers next.
[2:54:44.040 --> 2:54:45.640]  And what they have, I'm sure there's no problem
[2:54:45.640 --> 2:54:48.240]  from Democrats in Congress like wanting to do that.
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:49.560]  It's just they don't have the majorities.
[2:54:49.560 --> 2:54:51.400]  They'll have less of them after November, we think.
[2:54:51.400 --> 2:54:53.400]  So we'll probably see more of this on a state level
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:55.120]  before we see it again at the federal.
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:58.280]  By the way, the irony of Joe Biden saying,
[2:54:58.280 --> 2:55:01.080]  oh, the gun companies can't be sued.
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:02.960]  Well, not only is that inaccurate,
[2:55:02.960 --> 2:55:05.880]  he's the one that goes out and promotes the vaccines
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:06.960]  all day long.
[2:55:06.960 --> 2:55:10.760]  And the vaccine manufacturers, as far as I can tell,
[2:55:10.760 --> 2:55:14.840]  is actually the only industry that cannot be sued, literally.
[2:55:14.840 --> 2:55:16.560]  So it's just ironic that he does that.
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:20.200]  But I mean, when it all comes down to it, Cody,
[2:55:20.200 --> 2:55:23.720]  what did the ghost gun rule actually accomplish?
[2:55:23.720 --> 2:55:24.240]  Anything?
[2:55:24.240 --> 2:55:26.000]  I think there's some strange things
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:28.160]  that we don't quite understand yet in the rule.
[2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:29.800]  The rule is so large, and I think it
[2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:31.320]  has some unintended consequences, which
[2:55:31.320 --> 2:55:32.200]  are still processing.
[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:34.240]  So major litigation will proceed, of course.
[2:55:34.240 --> 2:55:37.280]  Gun owners of America, NRA, a Farmers Policy Coalition,
[2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:38.560]  a number of people will bring.
[2:55:38.560 --> 2:55:40.600]  I think the Second Amendment Foundation and even my company
[2:55:40.600 --> 2:55:42.880]  will be playing us in various challenges
[2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:44.120]  or parts of this regulation.
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:47.560]  So we'll get to see what ATF says in the litigation
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:49.320]  as additional explanation for what they mean.
[2:55:49.320 --> 2:55:52.800]  But for now, I would say it remains legal to make a gun
[2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:53.240]  at home.
[2:55:53.240 --> 2:55:54.240]  They haven't challenged that.
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:55:56.000]  They can't challenge that, even if they want to.
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:58.760]  It remains legal to 3D print your firearms, to CNC mill them,
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:01.240]  to use products like the ghost gun or CNC,
[2:56:01.240 --> 2:56:03.520]  or like I said, to use a 3D printer to make a Glock frame.
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:05.800]  They've not really attacked the heart of this industry
[2:56:05.800 --> 2:56:08.400]  or its ability to be made and reproduced on the internet.
[2:56:08.400 --> 2:56:09.840]  So what did they do?
[2:56:09.840 --> 2:56:11.800]  Well, and you know, there's a lot of nuance there,
[2:56:11.800 --> 2:56:13.480]  and that's good for a free society.
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:14.560]  You want nuance.
[2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:16.920]  You want things to be interpretable,
[2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:20.800]  because that provides more room for freedom and debate
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:22.000]  and discussion.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:24.800]  So when does it, if you've got a 3D printer at home,
[2:56:24.800 --> 2:56:27.000]  let's say somebody's got a 3D printer at home
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:30.760]  and they're thinking about maybe doing a 3D print of a gun,
[2:56:30.760 --> 2:56:34.160]  when is it considered, I guess, a firearm?
[2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:36.520]  In the case of 3D printing, you're kind of making something
[2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:37.200]  from nothing.
[2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:40.240]  So the ghost gun rules don't really catch on,
[2:56:40.240 --> 2:56:41.920]  because the ghost gun rules are concerned about like,
[2:56:41.920 --> 2:56:43.760]  when I have a block of metal or something that's kind of
[2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:46.400]  pre-machined, at what point does it reach a critical stage
[2:56:46.400 --> 2:56:48.880]  of manufacture where the law then considers it a firearm.
[2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:51.600]  With a 3D printer, I make something from the ground up,
[2:56:51.600 --> 2:56:53.480]  so by the time I'm done, I have made a gun.
[2:56:53.480 --> 2:56:55.840]  I've made something that's legally recognized as a firearm.
[2:56:55.840 --> 2:56:57.120]  But because I didn't pass through,
[2:56:57.120 --> 2:57:00.360]  I just did it from plastic filament or whatever you want,
[2:57:00.360 --> 2:57:02.680]  I didn't pass through a regulated manufacturer
[2:57:02.680 --> 2:57:04.000]  or any other type of authority that needed
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:07.160]  to include a serial number, I could just do it on my own.
[2:57:07.160 --> 2:57:10.120]  Cody Wilson with us, it's good to have you back.
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:13.160]  The website is still defdist.org,
[2:57:13.160 --> 2:57:15.240]  short for defense distributed.
[2:57:15.240 --> 2:57:16.840]  Yeah, that's right, defcad.com.
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:18.880]  If you want some files, learn how to 3D print a gun,
[2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:20.960]  ghostgunner.net, if you want to mill them.
[2:57:20.960 --> 2:57:23.320]  Well, and you've been empowering people
[2:57:23.320 --> 2:57:25.720]  with the 3D gun technology for years now,
[2:57:25.720 --> 2:57:27.960]  and you've gone through your fights,
[2:57:27.960 --> 2:57:29.440]  and we're glad you're with us here today.
[2:57:29.440 --> 2:57:31.320]  Cody Wilson, folks, you want to learn more about
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:35.400]  3D printed guns, defdist.org.
[2:57:35.400 --> 2:57:36.480]  Cody, thanks for joining us today.
[2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:37.320]  Thanks, sir.
[2:57:37.320 --> 2:57:39.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Stein,
[2:57:39.640 --> 2:57:41.320]  I think he's in the studio, he's in the house,
[2:57:41.320 --> 2:57:43.840]  he might be in a woman's swimsuit, we'll find out soon.
[2:57:47.680 --> 2:57:50.200]  Over the years, M4 Wars has produced
[2:57:50.200 --> 2:57:54.480]  more than 200 amazing patriot Americana
[2:57:54.480 --> 2:57:57.760]  Second Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts,
[2:57:57.760 --> 2:58:00.080]  ball caps, flags, you name it.
[2:58:00.080 --> 2:58:03.000]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:06.560]  at cost right now, that's just regular plain chain shirts,
[2:58:06.560 --> 2:58:10.000]  that is all sorts of designer shirts
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:12.480]  that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce,
[2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:15.080]  we used to sell for $40, we're selling them for $15,
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:17.240]  selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs us,
[2:58:17.240 --> 2:58:20.080]  the shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5
[2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:21.360]  for us to actually produce.
[2:58:21.360 --> 2:58:23.400]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10,
[2:58:23.400 --> 2:58:25.760]  and we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves,
[2:58:25.760 --> 2:58:27.800]  and we've got short sleeves, we've got them all,
[2:58:27.800 --> 2:58:29.120]  and we've got to liquidate them all,
[2:58:29.120 --> 2:58:31.960]  and they're limited edition, because we're never
[2:58:31.960 --> 2:58:33.600]  gonna make any of these designs.
[2:58:33.600 --> 2:58:36.640]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs
[2:58:36.640 --> 2:58:39.320]  that will be limited, limited edition in the future,
[2:58:39.320 --> 2:58:41.560]  we've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air,
[2:58:41.560 --> 2:58:44.240]  plus it spreads the word, infowarstore.com,
[2:58:44.240 --> 2:58:47.520]  here historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[2:58:47.520 --> 2:58:50.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com
[2:58:50.680 --> 2:58:55.680]  is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history,
[2:58:56.520 --> 2:58:59.440]  and that is because the economy is breaking down,
[2:58:59.440 --> 2:59:02.960]  inflation is exploding, the supply chains have broken down,
[2:59:02.960 --> 2:59:06.040]  and infowars is having serious trouble
[2:59:06.040 --> 2:59:08.160]  making its payroll and paying for operations,
[2:59:08.160 --> 2:59:11.080]  and I do not want to implode or downsize
[2:59:11.080 --> 2:59:13.480]  in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[2:59:13.480 --> 2:59:16.680]  Infowars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever,
[2:59:16.680 --> 2:59:19.520]  it's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship,
[2:59:19.520 --> 2:59:22.160]  but because of cost increasing and having to run
[2:59:22.160 --> 2:59:23.920]  our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth,
[2:59:23.920 --> 2:59:27.000]  everything else, we are running out of money.
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:31.040]  So listen, up to 75% off at infowarsstore.com
[2:59:31.040 --> 2:59:33.720]  on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts
[2:59:33.720 --> 2:59:36.360]  that help spread the word and fund the operation,
[2:59:36.360 --> 2:59:39.040]  on supplements, on books, on films,
[2:59:39.040 --> 2:59:42.160]  everything is 25 to 75% off right now,
[2:59:42.160 --> 2:59:45.520]  the biggest sell in our history at infowarsstore.com.
[2:59:45.520 --> 2:59:46.960]  Thank you for your support.
[2:59:50.240 --> 2:59:52.720]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[2:59:52.720 --> 2:59:57.720]  you are the resistance.
[3:00:03.720 --> 3:00:08.720]  Primetime, Alec Stone 99, he's in studio now,
[3:00:14.480 --> 3:00:17.000]  he's gonna be hosting the fourth hour today,
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:19.800]  but I had to just spend five minutes with him here
[3:00:19.800 --> 3:00:22.520]  as he joins us on the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:22.520 --> 3:00:25.400]  He's got some, let's see what do we have over here,
[3:00:25.400 --> 3:00:27.120]  we got some ivermectin, oh boy.
[3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:28.320]  Well Owen, you know, it's funny
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:29.720]  because I had a little bit of the sniffles
[3:00:29.720 --> 3:00:32.880]  and your boss, the man, the king, the legend,
[3:00:32.880 --> 3:00:35.960]  it went viral when he took his ivermectin online,
[3:00:35.960 --> 3:00:38.160]  so I said, you know what, I'm gonna take my dose on air
[3:00:38.160 --> 3:00:40.480]  and I wanna show you guys, on Primetime,
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:42.800]  you're like, oh that's for a horse, well I am a horse,
[3:00:42.800 --> 3:00:44.360]  if you're watching this, I'm stronger than a horse,
[3:00:44.360 --> 3:00:46.320]  I'm about three horsepower myself,
[3:00:46.320 --> 3:00:47.800]  so I really need three doses of this,
[3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:49.360]  but yes Owen, we're about to,
[3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:51.400]  this is what I'm saying, I'm more official
[3:00:51.400 --> 3:00:54.040]  than a referee's whistle, I'm on the AJ show
[3:00:54.040 --> 3:00:55.880]  with the man himself, Owen Schwier,
[3:00:55.880 --> 3:00:57.840]  you guys buckle up Buttercup
[3:00:57.840 --> 3:00:59.600]  cause he's gonna be a bumpy ride today.
[3:00:59.600 --> 3:01:01.640]  Three horsepower, now when that,
[3:01:01.640 --> 3:01:03.480]  how does that apply when you're in the water
[3:01:03.480 --> 3:01:06.000]  swimming against other female competitors?
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:08.160]  Well I have a huge advantage, I'm long,
[3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:11.480]  I mean, to be honest, you know, I shave my chest,
[3:01:11.480 --> 3:01:13.280]  so that does, you know, I'm a little silkier
[3:01:13.280 --> 3:01:16.200]  and smoother in the water, but my pit hair is slowing me down.
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:17.360]  You haven't made the full commit?
[3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:19.800]  I didn't, that's the problem because I'm in competing,
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:21.760]  but I still have all this hair under my pits
[3:01:21.760 --> 3:01:22.600]  and slowing me down.
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:24.560]  I mean, it's one thing to shave the chest,
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:27.520]  but the pits, it's, you know, I don't know.
[3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:30.440]  And you know what, honestly, my chest is so itchy
[3:01:30.440 --> 3:01:32.080]  that for the bit, I'll do anything.
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:33.640]  So the Seinfeld episode was real?
[3:01:33.640 --> 3:01:36.080]  Oh yes, dude, I'm like itching, I think I had bed,
[3:01:36.080 --> 3:01:37.160]  I just got back from New York,
[3:01:37.160 --> 3:01:39.640]  I don't know if I have bed bugs or my chest is itching.
[3:01:39.640 --> 3:01:41.880]  Those are known in New York, you may have caught a spell.
[3:01:41.880 --> 3:01:43.640]  That's what I'm saying, no seriously,
[3:01:43.640 --> 3:01:45.480]  I will do anything for the bit,
[3:01:45.480 --> 3:01:46.840]  but the fact that I shaved my chest
[3:01:46.840 --> 3:01:48.440]  and now I look like I have little breasts,
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:50.840]  it's not pleasurable, I like the chest hair,
[3:01:50.840 --> 3:01:51.680]  covered it up.
[3:01:51.680 --> 3:01:53.800]  Wait, I thought you maybe put some padding in it.
[3:01:53.800 --> 3:01:55.000]  There's padding, yes it is.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:57.880]  Okay, and to the next, this is what the next video
[3:01:57.880 --> 3:01:59.800]  is gonna be, I bought that bathing suit,
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:01.000]  I went to Dick's Sporting Goods,
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:03.640]  trying to buy an official women's, you know, race suit.
[3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:04.600]  By the way, Dick's Sporting Goods
[3:02:04.600 --> 3:02:06.280]  is probably sexist and bigoted,
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:07.120]  but we'll cover that later.
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:08.680]  Oh, for sure, yeah, I should be vagina sporting good.
[3:02:08.680 --> 3:02:11.080]  But this is what I'm saying, Dick's is I walked in there,
[3:02:11.080 --> 3:02:13.560]  I couldn't get an official bathing suit that fit,
[3:02:13.560 --> 3:02:15.080]  and there were like 79 bucks.
[3:02:15.080 --> 3:02:16.760]  Oh man, imagine Leah Thomas' problems.
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:20.000]  I mean, Leah Thomas, Lord of Mercy is taller than me,
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:21.320]  and has a bigger dong than me,
[3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:22.680]  so I'm sure she has a lot of trouble.
[3:02:22.680 --> 3:02:23.680]  But this is what I'm saying,
[3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:25.480]  so I went next door to TJ Maxx,
[3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:27.080]  and I bought this bathing suit,
[3:02:27.080 --> 3:02:29.880]  and it fit like a glove, and except for,
[3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:31.840]  the bra has like kind of a wire in it,
[3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:33.760]  so I'm actually gonna make a video of me returning it
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:36.320]  to TJ Maxx, and I'm gonna show them the video.
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:38.240]  And I think people will enjoy that,
[3:02:38.240 --> 3:02:40.040]  me returning the bra, because, you know,
[3:02:40.040 --> 3:02:42.360]  the bathing suit, because the bra was uncomfortable.
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:44.240]  Well, and I don't know what you're getting into today,
[3:02:44.240 --> 3:02:45.480]  but you brought this up to me,
[3:02:45.480 --> 3:02:47.640]  and I'm gonna have Cassidy Campbell on,
[3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:49.080]  hopefully tomorrow to talk about this.
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:51.640]  They're changing the rules, so basically,
[3:02:51.640 --> 3:02:53.280]  I love what you've done.
[3:02:53.280 --> 3:02:57.360]  You've created a new genre of content, you really have.
[3:02:57.360 --> 3:03:00.760]  And now the system is having to respond
[3:03:00.760 --> 3:03:04.760]  and adjust itself to this, and I don't think it's fair.
[3:03:04.760 --> 3:03:08.240]  But see, what you've done is you've exposed their logic.
[3:03:08.240 --> 3:03:11.440]  It's not that any man can compete in women's sports,
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:14.480]  only liberals, only liberals are allowed,
[3:03:14.480 --> 3:03:16.440]  all these advantages that they give.
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:17.760]  A conservative's not allowed to do it,
[3:03:17.760 --> 3:03:20.320]  so now they're trying to stop you from doing your bits.
[3:03:20.320 --> 3:03:22.440]  Well, 100%, and see, what I'm doing,
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:25.280]  and I didn't coin this term, it's called culture jamming,
[3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:27.520]  oh, and it's where you take the craziest part of our culture,
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:29.280]  and you jam it in their face.
[3:03:29.280 --> 3:03:31.120]  And sadly, this is the reality we live in
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:33.040]  when you have Leah Thomas, who swam on the men's team
[3:03:33.040 --> 3:03:35.640]  for three years, and then is able to go and compete
[3:03:35.640 --> 3:03:37.560]  in the NCAA Championships as a female
[3:03:37.560 --> 3:03:40.160]  that still has his male genitalia, and win.
[3:03:40.160 --> 3:03:42.760]  And that's the problem, that's against women's rights.
[3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:43.960]  I mean, we're in the upside-down world,
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:46.680]  so when I go and I try to call that hypocrisy out,
[3:03:46.680 --> 3:03:48.040]  oh no, we're gonna shut down the meeting,
[3:03:48.040 --> 3:03:49.160]  you only have one minute to speak,
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:50.720]  and they're gonna put it at the end of the meeting.
[3:03:50.720 --> 3:03:52.800]  So what I'm saying is, they don't realize
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:54.000]  when they're doing all of this,
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:56.160]  they are proving that we are winning the culture war.
[3:03:56.160 --> 3:03:58.520]  They are so shaken up by, they're afraid,
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:03:59.440]  they gotta change the whole meetings,
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:01.400]  and this is one of the city council members said,
[3:04:01.400 --> 3:04:03.400]  one of them had half a brain, he said,
[3:04:03.400 --> 3:04:06.480]  you know, I've been a member of this board for years,
[3:04:06.480 --> 3:04:08.840]  and this is the first time that we're ever changing
[3:04:08.840 --> 3:04:11.880]  the rules, and doesn't it appear that we're letting them win?
[3:04:11.880 --> 3:04:14.440]  And I'm in the audience like, duh, obviously it does,
[3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:16.760]  because they're bending over backwards, scared to death,
[3:04:16.760 --> 3:04:18.840]  anytime Cassie and I walk in that room.
[3:04:18.840 --> 3:04:21.160]  And it is, that's exactly what it is, your culture jamming,
[3:04:21.160 --> 3:04:23.680]  you're putting a mirror up to society
[3:04:23.680 --> 3:04:27.520]  at these city council hearings, and they can't stand it.
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:29.360]  Yeah, and you know, like, I know you've spoken
[3:04:29.360 --> 3:04:30.960]  on a lot of these meetings, and if you go there,
[3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:32.640]  and you give them the serious business,
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:33.680]  and you know, they're gonna look at you,
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:36.040]  oh, you're some tinfoil hat, you're some blah, blah, blah,
[3:04:36.040 --> 3:04:38.360]  they want you to do that, but the culture jamming
[3:04:38.360 --> 3:04:39.800]  is the most effective, because you're just,
[3:04:39.800 --> 3:04:40.880]  you're fighting fire.
[3:04:40.880 --> 3:04:42.760]  So that's it exactly, I've probably spoken
[3:04:42.760 --> 3:04:44.920]  at city councils 10, 15 times,
[3:04:44.920 --> 3:04:46.400]  maybe had some viral moments,
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:49.360]  but nothing nearly as powerful or viral as what you did,
[3:04:49.360 --> 3:04:51.520]  that's because I was serious, like I wanted a serious thing,
[3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:53.200]  and they were like, yeah, we don't care on to the next one.
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:54.600]  Alex Dine takes over.
[3:04:54.600 --> 3:04:55.440]  Let's go.

[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:38.360]  It's Prime Time 99, Alex Dine.
[3:06:38.360 --> 3:06:39.360]  And let me tell you something,
[3:06:39.360 --> 3:06:41.760]  the info war has just gotten started
[3:06:41.760 --> 3:06:44.280]  because I'm your general, Prime Time 99,
[3:06:44.280 --> 3:06:45.400]  and I'm trying to do my best.
[3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:47.640]  Alex Jones impersonation and yelling and screaming,
[3:06:47.640 --> 3:06:50.640]  but sadly, what is happening today in this day and age,
[3:06:50.640 --> 3:06:53.360]  we are being lied to on a huge level,
[3:06:53.360 --> 3:06:54.280]  so that's what I want to do,
[3:06:54.280 --> 3:06:55.680]  is I want to expose the lies,
[3:06:55.680 --> 3:06:58.160]  so it's such an honor to sit in the same seat
[3:06:58.160 --> 3:07:01.120]  as Alex Jones and do the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:07:01.120 --> 3:07:03.360]  For me, guys, I don't want to just sit here and cry
[3:07:03.360 --> 3:07:04.200]  and be all sad,
[3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:05.840]  because we got a lot of information to get into,
[3:07:05.840 --> 3:07:07.680]  but I just want to thank the entire crew,
[3:07:07.680 --> 3:07:09.920]  thank everybody at the info wars for this opportunity.
[3:07:09.920 --> 3:07:12.640]  For me, Doug, I'm in the championship game,
[3:07:12.640 --> 3:07:14.560]  I'm the quarterback, I'm in the main seat,
[3:07:14.560 --> 3:07:16.160]  so this is such an honor.
[3:07:16.160 --> 3:07:17.080]  And first of all, guys,
[3:07:17.080 --> 3:07:20.240]  we got to talk about what's going on right now in Kiev.
[3:07:20.240 --> 3:07:23.520]  I brought this article up before we even get,
[3:07:23.520 --> 3:07:25.120]  before we even really dial in
[3:07:25.120 --> 3:07:26.960]  to all the information we got to talk about.
[3:07:26.960 --> 3:07:31.040]  Now in Kiev, they're going back to their plays.
[3:07:31.040 --> 3:07:33.640]  Look at this, and in a way, they're kind of mocking us.
[3:07:33.640 --> 3:07:37.360]  In this article I pulled up, they're talking about in Kiev,
[3:07:37.360 --> 3:07:39.600]  they've brought back the plays,
[3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:41.520]  so now we're in World War III,
[3:07:41.520 --> 3:07:44.720]  but apparently, they can still have a Shakespearean play,
[3:07:44.720 --> 3:07:46.680]  and what the people are doing in Kiev
[3:07:46.680 --> 3:07:49.920]  is they're actually dressing in their finest garments,
[3:07:49.920 --> 3:07:51.200]  and they're going out there,
[3:07:51.200 --> 3:07:53.480]  and what they're doing is they're laughing at us,
[3:07:53.480 --> 3:07:55.960]  they're mocking us, because what's going on, guys,
[3:07:55.960 --> 3:07:58.880]  is we're having a World War III,
[3:07:58.880 --> 3:08:01.520]  every single war monger in the world wants us to go,
[3:08:01.520 --> 3:08:02.960]  the military industrial complex,
[3:08:02.960 --> 3:08:04.920]  wants us to go fight World War III
[3:08:04.920 --> 3:08:07.160]  and fight over the border between Russia and Ukraine,
[3:08:07.160 --> 3:08:09.360]  and their own citizens are going around
[3:08:09.360 --> 3:08:11.960]  and having a matinee and going to the play,
[3:08:11.960 --> 3:08:14.880]  yet our border between Texas and Mexico,
[3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:16.360]  they don't even care about.
[3:08:16.360 --> 3:08:17.840]  We're here in Austin, Texas,
[3:08:17.840 --> 3:08:19.360]  and let me tell you something, you go down the street,
[3:08:19.360 --> 3:08:20.760]  there are people that you can tell
[3:08:20.760 --> 3:08:22.120]  are strung out on drugs,
[3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:25.920]  the same drugs that are being ushered through our border,
[3:08:25.920 --> 3:08:28.240]  literally by not just cartels,
[3:08:28.240 --> 3:08:30.240]  but we are letting them come through,
[3:08:30.240 --> 3:08:33.080]  with Joe Biden's Title IV to II, what's going on,
[3:08:33.080 --> 3:08:37.520]  all these people are going to have free reign at our country,
[3:08:37.520 --> 3:08:38.960]  yet we're gonna sit here
[3:08:38.960 --> 3:08:41.880]  and we're gonna capitulate to the Ukraine,
[3:08:41.880 --> 3:08:44.640]  to Vladimir Zelensky, you're gonna have Vladimir Zelensky,
[3:08:44.640 --> 3:08:47.680]  is at the Grammys, this is what's going on in the world,
[3:08:47.680 --> 3:08:49.840]  guys, we should all really be upset,
[3:08:49.840 --> 3:08:52.120]  and we need to wake up to the tyranny,
[3:08:52.120 --> 3:08:54.040]  now I know Alex says that all the time,
[3:08:54.040 --> 3:08:56.480]  but it's just, it's a sad reality
[3:08:56.480 --> 3:08:59.280]  when you realize the tyranny that we're actually under,
[3:08:59.280 --> 3:09:02.120]  that people are mocking us, people are laughing at us,
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:04.920]  they're gonna talk about World War III all day long,
[3:09:04.920 --> 3:09:07.000]  and oh, we have to support the Ukraine,
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:09.400]  yet they won't even support our own country,
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:12.040]  and you have the same guy, Joe Biden is gonna say,
[3:09:12.040 --> 3:09:15.960]  oh, the inflation, the reason it's $8 a gallon of gas
[3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:17.960]  is because Vladimir Putin,
[3:09:17.960 --> 3:09:21.040]  no, it's gonna be $10 a gallon of gas
[3:09:21.040 --> 3:09:23.000]  because Joe Biden is incompetent
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:24.280]  because he doesn't care about you
[3:09:24.280 --> 3:09:27.040]  because they want to actually get rid of the middle class,
[3:09:27.040 --> 3:09:29.280]  we need to wake up to this, guys,
[3:09:29.280 --> 3:09:32.200]  this is the problem in society in this day and age,
[3:09:32.200 --> 3:09:33.840]  they want you either so poor
[3:09:33.840 --> 3:09:36.080]  that when you get your $600 stimulus check,
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:39.200]  you're like, oh, whoopee, I can buy my PlayStation,
[3:09:39.200 --> 3:09:42.480]  oh, I can be on PlayStation and play my video games all day,
[3:09:42.480 --> 3:09:44.520]  and that's where I can escape the harsh reality
[3:09:44.520 --> 3:09:46.920]  of the real world, but that's not okay, guys,
[3:09:46.920 --> 3:09:50.280]  it's $600 to me and $600 to somebody watching this
[3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:52.760]  realizes that doesn't go very far,
[3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:55.320]  but to a person that doesn't realize
[3:09:55.320 --> 3:09:57.280]  the harsh reality of our situation,
[3:09:57.280 --> 3:09:58.520]  they're gonna cheerlead it,
[3:09:58.520 --> 3:10:00.120]  so this is what I'm trying to say
[3:10:00.120 --> 3:10:02.920]  with all that's currently going on in this day and age,
[3:10:02.920 --> 3:10:05.920]  our inflation is only gonna get drastically worse,
[3:10:05.920 --> 3:10:07.880]  and we're at the point of no return,
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:09.520]  and listen, if you think Donald Trump
[3:10:09.520 --> 3:10:10.840]  is automatically gonna save it,
[3:10:10.840 --> 3:10:12.080]  no, we have to do something,
[3:10:12.080 --> 3:10:15.200]  we have to stand up and metaphorically fight back
[3:10:15.200 --> 3:10:17.800]  against the new world order, because this is the problem,
[3:10:17.800 --> 3:10:21.120]  it's a globalization of our resources,
[3:10:21.120 --> 3:10:23.520]  they're going to subvert, we have enough oil and gas
[3:10:23.520 --> 3:10:26.520]  in Texas to supply all of America,
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:29.400]  yet the Biden administration makes legislation
[3:10:29.400 --> 3:10:32.200]  almost impossible for people to get new drilling rigs
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:35.080]  in order to get access to our own oil and gas,
[3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:35.920]  and what are they gonna do?
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:37.600]  They're gonna lie to you, and they're gonna say,
[3:10:37.600 --> 3:10:41.200]  oh, oh, wait, wait, the gas is high,
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:46.200]  because of Vladimir Putin, and Jen Psaki is so full of it,
[3:10:46.280 --> 3:10:48.720]  that's why she's running to MSNBC,
[3:10:48.720 --> 3:10:50.160]  because she doesn't have anywhere to go,
[3:10:50.160 --> 3:10:53.440]  because she knows at the end of the day her goose is cooked,
[3:10:53.440 --> 3:10:55.280]  and we are obviously gonna be able to tell
[3:10:55.280 --> 3:10:58.360]  that they are so full of dog caca,
[3:10:58.360 --> 3:11:01.320]  we can smell it from a mile away,
[3:11:01.320 --> 3:11:03.880]  and I know most of the listeners listening here today,
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:05.560]  you guys are awake to the tyranny
[3:11:05.560 --> 3:11:07.080]  that we're currently experiencing,
[3:11:07.080 --> 3:11:09.920]  but the problem is most people are asleep,
[3:11:09.920 --> 3:11:12.480]  they're at the wheel, they have no idea what's going on,
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:15.200]  they don't have any idea how we're gonna fight this inflation,
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:17.560]  and you look at companies like BlackRock,
[3:11:17.560 --> 3:11:19.360]  you look at companies like Vanguard,
[3:11:19.360 --> 3:11:21.920]  what they're doing is they're artificially inflating
[3:11:21.920 --> 3:11:25.160]  the price of the housing market in order to make it impossible
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:27.680]  for a young person to even buy a house,
[3:11:27.680 --> 3:11:29.120]  because they want you to be a debt slave,
[3:11:29.120 --> 3:11:32.520]  they want you to be addicted to paying your monthly note
[3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:34.640]  on your apartment or your car,
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:36.400]  and they're gonna look and they're gonna laugh at you
[3:11:36.400 --> 3:11:41.120]  and say, oh well, young people just want the hotel lifestyle,
[3:11:41.120 --> 3:11:43.920]  yet you look at a guy like Klaus Schwab,
[3:11:43.920 --> 3:11:46.120]  he will even tell you in the future,
[3:11:46.120 --> 3:11:48.720]  you will own nothing and you will love it,
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:50.560]  you're gonna be so happy that you own nothing
[3:11:50.560 --> 3:11:51.960]  because you don't have any stress,
[3:11:51.960 --> 3:11:53.400]  you don't have to mow your lawn,
[3:11:53.400 --> 3:11:55.560]  if your toilet breaks you don't have to fix it,
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:11:57.520]  yet there's a million people out there
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:11:59.520]  that would love to be able to fix your toilet,
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:02.720]  but we have lost the plot because in this day and age
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:05.280]  we don't have that ownership mentality,
[3:12:05.280 --> 3:12:07.640]  we don't care about owning anything,
[3:12:07.640 --> 3:12:10.480]  and that's the problem is we're losing to people
[3:12:10.480 --> 3:12:12.920]  like Klaus Schwab in the World Economic Forum,
[3:12:12.920 --> 3:12:15.960]  who's gonna tell you that you're gonna be so happy,
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:17.800]  you're gonna rent your washing machine,
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:19.200]  you're gonna rent your car,
[3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:20.800]  you're gonna rent your internet service,
[3:12:20.800 --> 3:12:24.360]  and you're not gonna own one freaking thing,
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:26.400]  and they've laid the groundwork now
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:28.920]  where we're actually fighting the technocracy,
[3:12:28.920 --> 3:12:30.560]  and I know you're like, what does the technocracy
[3:12:30.560 --> 3:12:31.400]  have to do with this?
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:34.440]  Well, very easily guys, you have a digital footprint,
[3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:35.680]  and that digital footprint,
[3:12:35.680 --> 3:12:37.040]  they can delete you from the internet,
[3:12:37.040 --> 3:12:38.760]  they can put you on the no fly list,
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:40.800]  they can make it where you can't have a bank account,
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:42.440]  and then what are you gonna do?
[3:12:42.440 --> 3:12:45.320]  You're toast, you're up a creek without a paddle,
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:46.880]  and that's their plan,
[3:12:46.880 --> 3:12:48.360]  so what they're doing now,
[3:12:48.360 --> 3:12:51.760]  it's similar to, there's two trains of thoughts,
[3:12:51.760 --> 3:12:54.920]  there's the 1984 George Orwell train of thought,
[3:12:54.920 --> 3:12:56.720]  where they're gonna take everything from us,
[3:12:56.720 --> 3:12:58.760]  they're gonna say, oh, love is selfish,
[3:12:58.760 --> 3:13:00.960]  and you're gonna hate life,
[3:13:00.960 --> 3:13:02.000]  you're not gonna have any freedom,
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:04.560]  you're gonna have a constant surveillance,
[3:13:04.560 --> 3:13:07.160]  but see, the reason why that isn't, to me,
[3:13:07.160 --> 3:13:10.040]  as bad as the brave new world aspect,
[3:13:10.040 --> 3:13:13.080]  and these are two rules of thought for the future,
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:15.160]  you can either go with the brave new world aspect,
[3:13:15.160 --> 3:13:17.400]  where you're gonna be able to be on soma,
[3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:18.640]  they're gonna have you peeled out,
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:20.520]  you're gonna be having constant sex,
[3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:22.080]  you're gonna be distracted by movies,
[3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:23.360]  television, and media,
[3:13:23.360 --> 3:13:25.040]  and that's currently what's happening,
[3:13:25.040 --> 3:13:27.680]  so in my mind, when I look at the dystopian future
[3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:28.920]  that's right around the corner,
[3:13:28.920 --> 3:13:32.360]  I actually prefer the 1984 version,
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:34.160]  because at least in that version,
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:36.160]  people were upset, people are mad,
[3:13:36.160 --> 3:13:37.400]  people aren't comfortable,
[3:13:37.400 --> 3:13:39.920]  but what they're gonna do is they're going to,
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:42.720]  they're going to massage your back
[3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:44.520]  all the way into the gulags,
[3:13:44.520 --> 3:13:46.200]  they're gonna give you a back massage,
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:48.080]  oh, we're gonna rub your back,
[3:13:48.080 --> 3:13:49.440]  oh, you're gonna drive a Jeep,
[3:13:49.440 --> 3:13:50.840]  but you're never gonna own it,
[3:13:50.840 --> 3:13:52.680]  you're gonna be tricked into thinking
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:54.520]  that you live in this materialistic world
[3:13:54.520 --> 3:13:56.920]  where materials are gonna bring you happiness,
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:13:57.800]  and let me tell you something,
[3:13:57.800 --> 3:14:00.920]  if you think an inanimate object will bring you joy,
[3:14:00.920 --> 3:14:03.560]  you're wrong, you are wrong,
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:05.920]  and that is the laying the groundwork
[3:14:05.920 --> 3:14:07.200]  for the metaverse, guys,
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:08.360]  we're seeing this right now,
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:09.400]  you see on the screen,
[3:14:09.400 --> 3:14:11.080]  when you look at the Oculus headsets
[3:14:11.080 --> 3:14:12.280]  and you look at it now,
[3:14:12.280 --> 3:14:13.360]  this is just the beginning,
[3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:15.360]  this is the seed that they are planting,
[3:14:15.360 --> 3:14:17.600]  and you can pull up the articles right now,
[3:14:17.600 --> 3:14:18.840]  they're gonna have technology
[3:14:18.840 --> 3:14:21.480]  where you're not even gonna be able to differentiate
[3:14:21.480 --> 3:14:23.400]  between a digital version of sex
[3:14:23.400 --> 3:14:24.800]  and a real version of sex,
[3:14:24.800 --> 3:14:26.840]  they're gonna have objects connected to your genitals,
[3:14:26.840 --> 3:14:27.920]  connected to your brain,
[3:14:27.920 --> 3:14:29.960]  and you're gonna wanna plug into the metaverse,
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:31.680]  so what they're doing now,
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:34.560]  they're gonna make your life as terrible as possible
[3:14:34.560 --> 3:14:36.240]  here on planet Earth,
[3:14:36.240 --> 3:14:37.840]  and then they're gonna say,
[3:14:37.840 --> 3:14:41.200]  well, you only live to about 75 years old,
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:43.240]  but if you go and you plug into the matrix,
[3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:44.680]  you plug into the metaverse,
[3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:46.800]  you can live for a thousand years,
[3:14:46.800 --> 3:14:49.040]  that's right, you can live for a thousand years,
[3:14:49.040 --> 3:14:50.720]  and as a matter of fact,
[3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:53.320]  if you're overweight, you can be skinny,
[3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:54.920]  you can be the captain of your football team,
[3:14:54.920 --> 3:14:57.880]  you can be Tom Brady in the metaverse,
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:14:58.880]  but what you don't realize
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:01.200]  is once you plug into that metaverse, guys,
[3:15:01.200 --> 3:15:02.520]  that is when they're gonna kill you,
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:05.360]  that is when they're gonna take your soul,
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:07.520]  and that's something we have to realize,
[3:15:07.520 --> 3:15:09.000]  they don't want you to know
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:11.720]  that you are a special being,
[3:15:11.720 --> 3:15:14.840]  that just the fact that you are here was almost impossible,
[3:15:14.840 --> 3:15:16.480]  we have already won the lottery,
[3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:18.360]  we won the lottery of life,
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:20.800]  we won, but you wouldn't know that,
[3:15:20.800 --> 3:15:21.640]  you wouldn't know that
[3:15:21.640 --> 3:15:23.160]  because you're too worried about your bills,
[3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:25.160]  you're too worried about A, B, C, or D,
[3:15:25.160 --> 3:15:26.240]  and that's what I'm trying to do,
[3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:29.160]  is I wanna wake you up out of that massive gnosis
[3:15:29.160 --> 3:15:32.920]  to realize that every single day on earth, above ground,
[3:15:32.920 --> 3:15:35.400]  is a gift, is a gift,
[3:15:35.400 --> 3:15:37.760]  and we're gonna get into it on the other side of the break,
[3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:40.440]  but I just wanna make sure that you guys realize
[3:15:40.440 --> 3:15:42.520]  that the future can be changed
[3:15:42.520 --> 3:15:46.560]  in the battle of good versus evil, good can win, guys,
[3:15:46.560 --> 3:15:48.520]  so stay tuned, I'll see you on the other side of the break,
[3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:51.840]  thank you guys, I appreciate that introduction,
[3:15:51.840 --> 3:15:52.860]  let's go, baby.
[3:15:55.200 --> 3:15:58.600]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here,
[3:15:58.600 --> 3:16:00.680]  all over the world, from Australia,
[3:16:00.680 --> 3:16:03.040]  to the United States, from Canada, to Germany,
[3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:05.240]  these tyrants are tracking everything you do,
[3:16:05.240 --> 3:16:07.160]  everywhere you go, and then coming to your house
[3:16:07.160 --> 3:16:08.600]  and threatening, in some cases,
[3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:12.080]  actually taking people away into the night,
[3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:13.480]  to their facilities,
[3:16:13.480 --> 3:16:15.120]  and they're planning in the next year
[3:16:15.120 --> 3:16:17.480]  to expand their shield process,
[3:16:17.480 --> 3:16:18.640]  where they come and take, quote,
[3:16:18.640 --> 3:16:22.000]  healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:23.760]  This is nothing less than martial law,
[3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:25.640]  and one big thing you can do to fight back
[3:16:25.640 --> 3:16:27.960]  is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:29.600]  many of which are made here in America,
[3:16:29.600 --> 3:16:30.840]  and are very compliant,
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:33.200]  meaning US government military grade,
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:34.960]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:37.280]  We have the entire line of silent pocket,

[3:16:44.040 --> 3:16:47.000]  we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops,
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:48.880]  we've got them for iPads, it's all there
[3:16:48.880 --> 3:16:50.440]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:16:50.440 --> 3:16:52.320]  So protect your privacy today,
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:55.280]  and support the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[3:16:56.680 --> 3:16:58.360]  It was about 25 years ago
[3:16:58.360 --> 3:16:59.800]  that I wanted to expand infowar.
[3:16:59.800 --> 3:17:01.000]  So I've been on the air a couple of years,
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:03.520]  but I only had money to finance my own
[3:17:03.520 --> 3:17:05.400]  simple little local radio show.
[3:17:05.400 --> 3:17:06.560]  And I wanted to hire camera people,
[3:17:06.560 --> 3:17:07.440]  I wanted to make films,
[3:17:07.440 --> 3:17:09.800]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[3:17:09.800 --> 3:17:12.280]  And it was a t-shirt I designed, the first one,
[3:17:12.280 --> 3:17:15.040]  Mass Murderers Agreed Gun Control Works,
[3:17:15.040 --> 3:17:17.680]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members
[3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:18.600]  of my crew.
[3:17:18.600 --> 3:17:21.040]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:23.320]  We have that design over 100 others
[3:17:23.320 --> 3:17:25.200]  that will now all be limited editions,
[3:17:25.200 --> 3:17:26.920]  because whatever stock we've got in,
[3:17:26.920 --> 3:17:29.760]  that's it, we're selling everything out
[3:17:29.760 --> 3:17:32.360]  to fund the operation, to get rid of inventory.
[3:17:32.360 --> 3:17:33.880]  We'll still have some teachers in the future,
[3:17:33.880 --> 3:17:36.120]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[3:17:36.120 --> 3:17:38.520]  So if you wanna get any of these historic shirts,
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:40.960]  this is your last chance, I almost forgot.
[3:17:40.960 --> 3:17:44.680]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[3:17:44.680 --> 3:17:47.640]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie,
[3:17:47.640 --> 3:17:49.680]  every long sleeve, every t-shirt,
[3:17:49.680 --> 3:17:51.280]  regular shirts, designer shirts,
[3:17:51.280 --> 3:17:55.280]  they're all selling at cost, infowarstore.com.
[3:17:56.160 --> 3:17:59.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com
[3:17:59.320 --> 3:18:04.320]  is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:08.040]  And that is because the economy is breaking down,
[3:18:08.040 --> 3:18:11.560]  inflation is exploding, the supply chains have broken down,
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:14.640]  and info wars is having serious trouble
[3:18:14.640 --> 3:18:16.760]  making its payroll and paying for operations.
[3:18:16.760 --> 3:18:19.680]  And I do not wanna implode or downsize
[3:18:19.680 --> 3:18:22.080]  in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[3:18:22.080 --> 3:18:25.280]  Info wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever,
[3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:28.120]  it's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[3:18:28.120 --> 3:18:30.240]  But because of cost increasing
[3:18:30.240 --> 3:18:31.520]  and having to run our own infrastructure
[3:18:31.520 --> 3:18:33.400]  and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else,
[3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:35.600]  we are running out of money.
[3:18:35.600 --> 3:18:39.600]  So listen, up to 75% off at infowarstore.com
[3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:42.280]  on things like amazing patriot t-shirts
[3:18:42.280 --> 3:18:44.960]  that helps spread the word and fund the operation.
[3:18:44.960 --> 3:18:47.640]  On supplements, on books, on films,
[3:18:47.640 --> 3:18:50.720]  everything is 25 to 75% off right now.
[3:18:50.720 --> 3:18:54.120]  The biggest sell in our history at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:54.120 --> 3:18:55.480]  Thank you for your support.
[3:18:56.640 --> 3:18:59.160]  Over the years, info wars has produced
[3:18:59.160 --> 3:19:03.440]  more than 200 amazing patriot Americana
[3:19:03.440 --> 3:19:06.720]  second amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts,
[3:19:06.720 --> 3:19:10.320]  ball caps, flags, you name it, all of the apparel
[3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:13.000]  and the flags are being sold at cost right now.
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:15.520]  That's just regular plain chain shirts
[3:19:15.520 --> 3:19:18.960]  that is all sorts of designer shirts
[3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:21.480]  that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:24.080]  We used to sell for 40, we're selling them for 15,
[3:19:24.080 --> 3:19:26.240]  selling them for 20, whatever the shirt costs us.
[3:19:26.240 --> 3:19:29.080]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5
[3:19:29.080 --> 3:19:30.360]  for us to actually produce.
[3:19:30.360 --> 3:19:32.400]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:34.760]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves
[3:19:34.760 --> 3:19:35.760]  and we've got short sleeves.
[3:19:35.760 --> 3:19:38.120]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all
[3:19:38.120 --> 3:19:39.400]  and they're limited edition
[3:19:39.400 --> 3:19:42.600]  because we're never gonna make any of these designs.
[3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:45.640]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs
[3:19:45.640 --> 3:19:48.280]  that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[3:19:48.280 --> 3:19:50.560]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air
[3:19:50.560 --> 3:19:53.240]  plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com.
[3:19:53.240 --> 3:19:56.600]  Here historic apparel now infowarstore.com.
[3:19:56.600 --> 3:19:59.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:19:59.400 --> 3:20:06.400]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:10.400 --> 3:20:12.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back from the break
[3:20:12.200 --> 3:20:14.920]  in prime time 99, Alex Dine,
[3:20:14.920 --> 3:20:17.800]  our fourth hour host of the info war.
[3:20:17.800 --> 3:20:19.920]  Let me tell you something guys,
[3:20:19.920 --> 3:20:22.240]  we are not going to be able to survive
[3:20:22.240 --> 3:20:23.320]  without your support.
[3:20:23.320 --> 3:20:26.040]  So I want you guys to really actually go up there
[3:20:26.040 --> 3:20:29.000]  and I'm not trying to sound like one of these pulpit pimps
[3:20:29.000 --> 3:20:31.080]  but I'm telling you, when you support Alex Jones,
[3:20:31.080 --> 3:20:33.480]  you're actually supporting an individual
[3:20:33.480 --> 3:20:34.880]  that is trying to make a difference.
[3:20:34.880 --> 3:20:36.240]  That's not trying to virtue signal.
[3:20:36.240 --> 3:20:37.440]  He is actually virtuous.
[3:20:37.440 --> 3:20:38.960]  He's actually trying to wake people up.
[3:20:38.960 --> 3:20:41.840]  So really consider going to infowarstore.com
[3:20:41.840 --> 3:20:42.760]  and purchasing something.
[3:20:42.760 --> 3:20:44.800]  Let me tell you something, ever since my viral success,
[3:20:44.800 --> 3:20:47.680]  I've been using the heck out of the super male vitality.
[3:20:47.680 --> 3:20:50.040]  I got ladies, I'm beating them off with a stick, all right?
[3:20:50.040 --> 3:20:52.760]  And you can have that same success because I'm telling you,
[3:20:52.760 --> 3:20:54.280]  this stuff will make you harder
[3:20:54.280 --> 3:20:55.720]  than Chinese arithmetic as they say.
[3:20:55.720 --> 3:20:57.920]  But at the end of the day, it's not just about that.
[3:20:57.920 --> 3:20:59.320]  There's a lot of other products
[3:20:59.320 --> 3:21:00.560]  that are going to help your wellness
[3:21:00.560 --> 3:21:01.800]  because that's what they don't want you to have.
[3:21:01.800 --> 3:21:03.880]  They want you to be eating microplastics.
[3:21:03.880 --> 3:21:06.840]  They want you to be hooked on pharmaceutical drugs.
[3:21:06.840 --> 3:21:08.560]  None of that stuff at the end of the day
[3:21:08.560 --> 3:21:09.680]  is going to help you.
[3:21:09.680 --> 3:21:13.600]  You really need to look into taking accountability
[3:21:13.600 --> 3:21:15.000]  for your own health.
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:16.920]  That's one of the most important things we can do
[3:21:16.920 --> 3:21:19.320]  because life is short and we don't want to run
[3:21:19.320 --> 3:21:21.400]  into the metaverse because your health is so poor.
[3:21:21.400 --> 3:21:22.240]  That's what they're going to say.
[3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:23.080]  They want you so fat.
[3:21:23.080 --> 3:21:24.000]  Oh, well, in the metaverse,
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:26.000]  you could immediately lose 300 pounds.
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:29.040]  So make sure to go out there and support infowarstore.com.
[3:21:29.040 --> 3:21:29.920]  Get a t-shirt.
[3:21:29.920 --> 3:21:31.480]  We got a 70% off sale.
[3:21:31.480 --> 3:21:35.320]  And listen, this is not going to in George Soros' pocket.
[3:21:35.320 --> 3:21:37.640]  This isn't going to some globalist billionaire.
[3:21:37.640 --> 3:21:39.840]  This is actually going to pay for the crew
[3:21:39.840 --> 3:21:41.760]  because these people work so hard.
[3:21:41.760 --> 3:21:43.960]  You have no idea the effort they put in there.
[3:21:43.960 --> 3:21:45.120]  And really and truly,
[3:21:45.120 --> 3:21:46.920]  they're probably not even compensated well enough
[3:21:46.920 --> 3:21:49.120]  because everybody here is doing this
[3:21:49.120 --> 3:21:53.360]  because they know that the agenda against us is a terrible,
[3:21:53.360 --> 3:21:54.600]  we're under so much tyranny.
[3:21:54.600 --> 3:21:57.400]  People are doing this for the love of the game, as they say.
[3:21:57.400 --> 3:21:59.160]  These aren't a bunch of diva-wide receivers
[3:21:59.160 --> 3:22:00.120]  that are sitting out.
[3:22:00.120 --> 3:22:02.120]  These people come here and show up every day
[3:22:02.120 --> 3:22:03.600]  because they know that the fight
[3:22:03.600 --> 3:22:05.200]  that they're fighting is just.
[3:22:05.200 --> 3:22:06.400]  Okay, so on top of that,
[3:22:06.400 --> 3:22:09.240]  now let's get back into a little bit of the fourth hour.
[3:22:09.240 --> 3:22:11.800]  Now there's an article coming out about a new book
[3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:14.840]  and it talks and it details about Ghislaine Maxwell.
[3:22:14.840 --> 3:22:15.960]  You know, like Alex, well, you know,
[3:22:15.960 --> 3:22:17.920]  I have Ghislaine Maxwell overload.
[3:22:17.920 --> 3:22:20.840]  I'm sick and tired of hearing about Jeffrey Epstein
[3:22:20.840 --> 3:22:22.080]  and Ghislaine Maxwell.
[3:22:22.080 --> 3:22:23.800]  Well, let me tell you why this is so important
[3:22:23.800 --> 3:22:25.840]  and this is why we shouldn't ever forget about it
[3:22:25.840 --> 3:22:28.440]  because we have Bill Clinton
[3:22:28.440 --> 3:22:31.160]  flew on the Lolita Express 26 times,
[3:22:31.160 --> 3:22:35.000]  oftentimes, without his secret service.
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:37.160]  Now that's almost impossible for an ex-president
[3:22:37.160 --> 3:22:39.640]  to even get rid of his secret service.
[3:22:39.640 --> 3:22:41.360]  And the reason why I wanna bring up this article,
[3:22:41.360 --> 3:22:42.880]  because in the article it talks about
[3:22:42.880 --> 3:22:45.560]  how Ghislaine Maxwell's dad, Robert Maxwell,
[3:22:45.560 --> 3:22:49.240]  who had a proper Israeli funeral, as a matter of fact,
[3:22:49.240 --> 3:22:52.120]  we know that he is what we call a double agent.
[3:22:52.120 --> 3:22:54.560]  He worked for Israeli intelligence
[3:22:54.560 --> 3:22:56.600]  and what he would do is he would get information
[3:22:56.600 --> 3:22:59.600]  on important people through a process called honey potting.
[3:22:59.600 --> 3:23:00.960]  Now I know a lot of people that are listening,
[3:23:00.960 --> 3:23:02.160]  they already know this,
[3:23:02.160 --> 3:23:04.240]  but in this honey potting theory, what they do is,
[3:23:04.240 --> 3:23:05.520]  this is what they get politicians.
[3:23:05.520 --> 3:23:07.520]  You see Madison Cawthorne just talking about
[3:23:07.520 --> 3:23:09.680]  how they have orgies in Washington.
[3:23:09.680 --> 3:23:12.680]  What they do is they put you in a vulnerable position.
[3:23:12.680 --> 3:23:14.040]  Then they have dirt and evidence.
[3:23:14.040 --> 3:23:16.240]  That's why they want you to sleep with a child.
[3:23:16.240 --> 3:23:19.440]  That's why they want you to do something homosexual
[3:23:19.440 --> 3:23:20.920]  because then they have leverage on you
[3:23:20.920 --> 3:23:22.480]  and then they own you.
[3:23:22.480 --> 3:23:24.000]  And so you look at Robert Maxwell,
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:26.280]  he was one of the most effective people in doing this.
[3:23:26.280 --> 3:23:29.440]  And in this book, it talks about how he abused Ghislaine.
[3:23:29.440 --> 3:23:31.880]  It talks about how she had special tools
[3:23:31.880 --> 3:23:35.120]  that he would use to spank her or to whip her.
[3:23:35.120 --> 3:23:36.800]  Now for me, I was lucky enough,
[3:23:36.800 --> 3:23:38.520]  I only got a spanking if I was really bad,
[3:23:38.520 --> 3:23:40.200]  very far and few in between.
[3:23:40.200 --> 3:23:44.000]  I would never ever think of my dad as an abusive father.
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:46.280]  But this is the fact that Ghislaine Maxwell's dad,
[3:23:46.280 --> 3:23:50.240]  Robert Maxwell, who was a wealthy man, a powerful man,
[3:23:50.240 --> 3:23:51.800]  the fact that he would hit his daughter
[3:23:51.800 --> 3:23:53.920]  is one of the most disgusting things.
[3:23:53.920 --> 3:23:56.360]  But the problem with it is that these relationships
[3:23:56.360 --> 3:23:57.880]  are oftentimes cyclical.
[3:23:57.880 --> 3:24:00.720]  Somebody that was abused as a child, like Ghislaine,
[3:24:00.720 --> 3:24:02.680]  doesn't have the ability to feel empathy
[3:24:02.680 --> 3:24:04.160]  for the children that she abuses
[3:24:04.160 --> 3:24:06.200]  because she feels like that's their right of passage
[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:08.080]  because she went through that.
[3:24:08.080 --> 3:24:10.080]  That's probably the same with Jeffrey Epstein now.
[3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:11.160]  I don't know about his upbringing,
[3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:13.520]  but I think it's very likely the abuse that he did
[3:24:13.520 --> 3:24:15.920]  to children, he may have been abused as a child.
[3:24:15.920 --> 3:24:17.000]  So when you look at this,
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:18.880]  and you look at these high profile people,
[3:24:18.880 --> 3:24:20.840]  you look at Ghislaine Maxwell,
[3:24:20.840 --> 3:24:23.600]  at Hillary Clinton, at their daughter's wedding,
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:24.920]  at Chelsea Clinton's wedding,
[3:24:24.920 --> 3:24:27.640]  these people are the most connected people in the world.
[3:24:27.640 --> 3:24:30.000]  You look at Dennis Hasser, speaker of the house,
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:31.800]  convicted pedophile.
[3:24:31.800 --> 3:24:35.440]  You look at, we call the groomer-in-chief himself,
[3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:36.280]  Joe Biden.
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:37.880]  Now we don't have a lot of evidence of Joe Biden
[3:24:37.880 --> 3:24:39.360]  doing anything other than weird pictures
[3:24:39.360 --> 3:24:40.760]  of him smelling children,
[3:24:40.760 --> 3:24:43.700]  but where there's smoke, there's fire in my opinion.
[3:24:43.700 --> 3:24:47.760]  We have a society and a system that is rigged against us
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:50.440]  and these ultra elites, when they do get in trouble,
[3:24:50.440 --> 3:24:53.120]  they get off, they get small punishments.
[3:24:53.120 --> 3:24:55.320]  And now they're trying to capitulate to us
[3:24:55.320 --> 3:24:58.320]  and they're locking Ghislaine Maxwell up for life
[3:24:58.320 --> 3:25:01.120]  or whatever lie they're gonna give us,
[3:25:01.120 --> 3:25:02.880]  and it's gonna be a very unjust punishment
[3:25:02.880 --> 3:25:06.240]  because they have information of huge celebrities,
[3:25:06.240 --> 3:25:08.800]  huge politicians doing disgusting,
[3:25:08.800 --> 3:25:12.200]  even evil things with children that we're never gonna see.
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:14.600]  We're never gonna get the real information.
[3:25:14.600 --> 3:25:16.720]  The same, we're gonna get about the same information
[3:25:16.720 --> 3:25:19.120]  as when Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself
[3:25:19.120 --> 3:25:21.600]  and they said, oh, the cameras were off.
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:23.400]  Oh, the guards fell asleep.
[3:25:23.400 --> 3:25:26.280]  And then when they go to court, the guards are let off.
[3:25:26.280 --> 3:25:28.240]  They have no criminal charges.
[3:25:28.240 --> 3:25:30.000]  And then you look at Jean-Luc Brunel,
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:31.920]  who was also a child procurer.
[3:25:31.920 --> 3:25:36.680]  He also died under similar circumstances as Jeffrey Epstein.
[3:25:36.680 --> 3:25:38.760]  So these people have evidence, the same,
[3:25:38.760 --> 3:25:40.200]  just like Robert Maxwell,
[3:25:40.200 --> 3:25:42.160]  that could actually shake the system,
[3:25:42.160 --> 3:25:44.120]  could actually do what we want
[3:25:44.120 --> 3:25:47.080]  because really, we want the whole system blown up.
[3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:48.160]  And that's a metaphor.
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:50.120]  But we don't want these evil people in power.
[3:25:50.120 --> 3:25:52.480]  We want to expose every single one of them,
[3:25:52.480 --> 3:25:55.280]  but we're never gonna be able to expose them
[3:25:55.280 --> 3:25:57.160]  because they're always going to give us,
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:25:59.560]  you know, they're gonna give us a little bit,
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:01.400]  but never the true information.
[3:26:01.400 --> 3:26:03.600]  They're gonna give us, oh, Ghislaine Maxwell got arrested.
[3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:06.600]  Oh, oh, we're so happy, she's in jail.
[3:26:06.600 --> 3:26:10.040]  Yet we know Bill Clinton was on that plane.
[3:26:10.040 --> 3:26:11.880]  Celebrities were on that plane.
[3:26:11.880 --> 3:26:13.840]  Bill Gates was on that plane.
[3:26:13.840 --> 3:26:15.840]  Can you look at Bill Gates' wife?
[3:26:15.840 --> 3:26:18.080]  She's talking about, oh, I knew Jeffrey Epstein
[3:26:18.080 --> 3:26:18.920]  was weird when I met him.
[3:26:18.920 --> 3:26:21.120]  Oh, I knew he was weird.
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:23.480]  These are the most powerful people in the world.
[3:26:23.480 --> 3:26:27.280]  Bill Gates has, you know, made a global vaccine.
[3:26:27.280 --> 3:26:30.480]  He's the biggest vaccine salesman in the entire world.
[3:26:30.480 --> 3:26:34.200]  And this guy was hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein,
[3:26:34.200 --> 3:26:37.960]  somebody that we know abused children.
[3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:40.960]  And nobody in the mainstream media will mention it.
[3:26:40.960 --> 3:26:43.680]  That's why you have to come to a place like Infowars
[3:26:43.680 --> 3:26:45.040]  to get this information.
[3:26:45.040 --> 3:26:47.000]  And that's what makes me so mad.
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:49.880]  It makes me so mad that we have the mockingbird media
[3:26:49.880 --> 3:26:51.840]  that's never gonna give us the real facts.
[3:26:51.840 --> 3:26:53.840]  It's never gonna tell you what's really happening.
[3:26:53.840 --> 3:26:56.240]  All they're gonna do is tinkle on you all day long
[3:26:56.240 --> 3:26:57.640]  and say, oh, it's raining.
[3:26:57.640 --> 3:26:59.080]  Oh, it's raining, that's not tinkle.
[3:26:59.080 --> 3:27:03.400]  I know it smells like that, but no, no, that's rainwater.
[3:27:03.400 --> 3:27:05.720]  So you can never get this real information.
[3:27:05.720 --> 3:27:08.720]  We're never gonna know unless you open your eyes
[3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:09.920]  that God gave you to see.
[3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:12.040]  And that's what I'm trying to ask people to do today.
[3:27:12.040 --> 3:27:14.680]  When I first started creating content,
[3:27:14.680 --> 3:27:17.040]  I was coming at it from a real pragmatic sense.
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:18.440]  I was giving you guys information,
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:19.760]  kind of like what I'm doing now.
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:22.640]  And then I realized people weren't jiving with that.
[3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:25.280]  People weren't really just super-acceptive of that.
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:26.400]  They weren't accepting of it
[3:27:26.400 --> 3:27:29.440]  because we're constantly under information overload.
[3:27:29.440 --> 3:27:30.960]  Everybody's, oh, here's a stat.
[3:27:30.960 --> 3:27:34.120]  You look at CNN, 600,000 desks, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3:27:34.120 --> 3:27:37.320]  From every single aspect, you're gonna get data.
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:39.200]  And so what I try to do,
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:41.320]  and what Alex Jones is so effective at doing,
[3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:43.080]  is we have to give them some sugar
[3:27:43.080 --> 3:27:44.480]  to help the medicine go down.
[3:27:44.480 --> 3:27:46.520]  We have to actually give them some sort of humor.
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:48.240]  We have to create some sort of levity.
[3:27:48.240 --> 3:27:50.000]  Now, I know I'm talking about serious subjects
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:53.160]  like Ghislaine Maxwell and her being a child sex procure,
[3:27:53.160 --> 3:27:57.120]  but we have to be able to laugh and not laugh at this.
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:27:58.120]  There's nothing funny about that,
[3:27:58.120 --> 3:28:00.200]  but we have to find reasons to have joy.
[3:28:00.200 --> 3:28:02.880]  We have to find reasons to be happy.
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:04.080]  Because if we don't,
[3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:06.760]  then we're just stuck plugged into their fake matrix,
[3:28:06.760 --> 3:28:08.200]  their mainstream media,
[3:28:08.200 --> 3:28:12.400]  Don LeMond matrix of all bull crap.
[3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:14.040]  And that's why it's called bull crap,
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:16.280]  because there's nothing of substance in it.
[3:28:16.280 --> 3:28:17.680]  It won't grow anything.
[3:28:17.680 --> 3:28:19.360]  You can't use it to compost.
[3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:22.960]  And that's the difference between real crap and bull crap.
[3:28:22.960 --> 3:28:24.920]  And we don't want the bull.
[3:28:24.920 --> 3:28:27.520]  We want the real deal stuff.
[3:28:27.520 --> 3:28:29.760]  And that's why you guys listening to InfoWars today,
[3:28:29.760 --> 3:28:31.480]  we're gonna be able to give you information.
[3:28:31.480 --> 3:28:35.320]  We're gonna be able to spread the real truth out there
[3:28:35.320 --> 3:28:38.800]  and expose these people for their terrible crimes
[3:28:38.800 --> 3:28:39.800]  against humanity.
[3:28:39.800 --> 3:28:40.800]  And let me tell you something.
[3:28:40.800 --> 3:28:42.800]  After the break, we're gonna dive deep into some,
[3:28:42.800 --> 3:28:45.480]  some a YouTuber got arrested at USC
[3:28:45.480 --> 3:28:47.280]  that I have a little personal connection to.
[3:28:47.280 --> 3:28:48.240]  I wanna bring that up.
[3:28:48.240 --> 3:28:49.920]  And then we're also gonna talk about the metaverse.
[3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:52.040]  So we'll see you on the other side of the break.
[3:28:52.040 --> 3:28:52.880]  Stay tuned.
[3:28:52.880 --> 3:28:53.720]  Thank you guys.
[3:28:55.760 --> 3:28:57.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[3:28:57.760 --> 3:29:01.200]  I need your help keeping InfoWars on the air and strong.
[3:29:01.200 --> 3:29:05.200]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[3:29:05.200 --> 3:29:06.280]  I was born for this.
[3:29:06.280 --> 3:29:07.280]  You were born for this.
[3:29:07.280 --> 3:29:09.880]  And people are really waking up right now,
[3:29:09.880 --> 3:29:12.320]  but we had to build our own infrastructure
[3:29:12.320 --> 3:29:14.840]  because of the censorship and de-platforming
[3:29:14.840 --> 3:29:16.440]  that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[3:29:16.440 --> 3:29:18.320]  And now with Band-Aught Video
[3:29:18.320 --> 3:29:20.520]  getting close to 10 million views a day,
[3:29:20.520 --> 3:29:23.840]  we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists
[3:29:23.840 --> 3:29:28.000]  and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:32.640]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[3:29:32.640 --> 3:29:36.040]  InfoWars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership
[3:29:36.040 --> 3:29:38.880]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[3:29:38.880 --> 3:29:41.360]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone
[3:29:41.360 --> 3:29:43.440]  are millions of dollars a quarter,
[3:29:43.440 --> 3:29:45.440]  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[3:29:45.440 --> 3:29:48.600]  So the biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now.
[3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:51.760]  The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,
[3:29:51.760 --> 3:29:55.120]  getting credible products and keep InfoWars as strong as ever.
[3:29:56.280 --> 3:29:59.480]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand InfoWars.
[3:29:59.480 --> 3:30:00.600]  I've been on the air a couple of years,
[3:30:00.600 --> 3:30:03.080]  and I only had money to finance my own
[3:30:03.080 --> 3:30:04.960]  simple little local radio show.
[3:30:04.960 --> 3:30:06.120]  And I wanted to hire camera people.
[3:30:06.120 --> 3:30:07.040]  I wanted to make films.
[3:30:07.040 --> 3:30:09.360]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[3:30:09.360 --> 3:30:10.840]  And it was a t-shirt I designed.
[3:30:10.840 --> 3:30:14.600]  The first one, mass murderers agreed, gun control works,
[3:30:14.600 --> 3:30:17.240]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members
[3:30:17.240 --> 3:30:18.200]  of my crew.
[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:20.640]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[3:30:20.640 --> 3:30:22.880]  We have that design over a hundred others
[3:30:22.880 --> 3:30:24.800]  that will now all be limited to issues
[3:30:24.800 --> 3:30:26.520]  because whatever stock we've got in,
[3:30:26.520 --> 3:30:29.320]  that's it, we're selling everything out
[3:30:29.320 --> 3:30:31.920]  to find the operation to get rid of inventory.
[3:30:31.920 --> 3:30:33.480]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future.
[3:30:33.480 --> 3:30:35.680]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[3:30:35.680 --> 3:30:38.120]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts,
[3:30:38.120 --> 3:30:40.560]  this is your last chance, I almost forgot.
[3:30:40.560 --> 3:30:44.240]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarsstore.com.
[3:30:44.240 --> 3:30:47.240]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie,
[3:30:47.240 --> 3:30:50.080]  every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts,
[3:30:50.080 --> 3:30:52.560]  designer shirts, they're all selling at cost,

[3:32:18.240 --> 3:32:20.720]  that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[3:32:20.720 --> 3:32:22.160]  We used to sell for $40.
[3:32:22.160 --> 3:32:24.040]  We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[3:32:24.040 --> 3:32:26.680]  Whatever the shirt costs us, if a shirt costs $5,
[3:32:26.680 --> 3:32:29.600]  we're selling it for $5 for essentially produce.
[3:32:29.600 --> 3:32:31.640]  If it costs $10, we're selling it for $10.

[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:35.000]  and we've got short sleeves.

[3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:41.840]  going to make any of these designs.

[3:32:47.560 --> 3:32:49.800]  We've got to sell this to keep InfoWars on the air,
[3:32:49.800 --> 3:32:51.040]  plus it spreads the word.
[3:32:51.040 --> 3:32:53.960]  InfoWarsStore.com, hear historic apparel now.
[3:32:53.960 --> 3:32:56.600]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:32:56.600 --> 3:33:01.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[3:33:01.160 --> 3:33:02.400]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:06.160 --> 3:33:11.720]  And we're back from the break, guys.
[3:33:11.720 --> 3:33:12.220]  Thank you.
[3:33:12.220 --> 3:33:14.600]  Make sure to go to infowarsstore.com
[3:33:14.600 --> 3:33:16.440]  and give us some support because we need it
[3:33:16.440 --> 3:33:18.560]  because we are fighting a literal war,
[3:33:18.560 --> 3:33:20.200]  and we have the globalists against us.
[3:33:20.200 --> 3:33:22.160]  We're not just saying that that's not
[3:33:22.160 --> 3:33:23.320]  in a hyperbolic statement.
[3:33:23.320 --> 3:33:24.920]  That's not a metaphorical statement.
[3:33:24.920 --> 3:33:26.600]  We are actually fighting globalism,
[3:33:26.600 --> 3:33:29.520]  and I want to talk about New York City right now.
[3:33:29.520 --> 3:33:31.000]  It's very convenient.
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:33.560]  Joe Biden just had a speech about ghost guns,
[3:33:33.560 --> 3:33:35.800]  and you look at who he's putting in charge of the ATF.
[3:33:35.800 --> 3:33:38.800]  He's putting somebody that wants to get rid of assault weapons,
[3:33:38.800 --> 3:33:42.440]  and they want to require background checks for everything.
[3:33:42.440 --> 3:33:44.240]  And this is not an accident, guys.
[3:33:44.240 --> 3:33:46.960]  And I'm not saying this is some sort of false flag attack.
[3:33:46.960 --> 3:33:47.960]  I don't want to say that.
[3:33:47.960 --> 3:33:50.560]  What's happening in New York, which is very convenient,
[3:33:50.560 --> 3:33:53.920]  a person on the subway, in the most famous subway
[3:33:53.920 --> 3:33:56.400]  in the entire world, you can go on my Twitter,
[3:33:56.400 --> 3:33:58.960]  you can go, you know, it's all over online right now.
[3:33:58.960 --> 3:33:59.480]  They're shooting.
[3:33:59.480 --> 3:34:01.560]  These people are, you know, they're leaving a train,
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:03.720]  things full of smoke, and somebody
[3:34:03.720 --> 3:34:05.360]  was shot multiple times.
[3:34:05.360 --> 3:34:07.360]  Now, this is where I have a huge problem, guys.
[3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:09.440]  This is in New York City.
[3:34:09.440 --> 3:34:11.880]  These same police officers in New York City,
[3:34:11.880 --> 3:34:13.480]  when the people got off the train,
[3:34:13.480 --> 3:34:16.640]  because this was a transfer point,
[3:34:16.640 --> 3:34:17.960]  there is multiple other trains.
[3:34:17.960 --> 3:34:20.920]  I believe this is the R train, the N train.
[3:34:20.920 --> 3:34:23.440]  And so now the shooter, the shooter
[3:34:23.440 --> 3:34:26.640]  was able to get off that train and then hop on another train
[3:34:26.640 --> 3:34:29.880]  to some other borough and magically get away.
[3:34:29.880 --> 3:34:32.600]  Now, and guys, we have enough technology
[3:34:32.600 --> 3:34:34.920]  to be able to track anybody that goes, you know,
[3:34:34.920 --> 3:34:37.120]  they could figure out who these people are.
[3:34:37.120 --> 3:34:39.520]  But because he's probably not the right color,
[3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:41.560]  or because he doesn't fit the right agenda,
[3:34:41.560 --> 3:34:43.840]  they're just going to let the guy walk free,
[3:34:43.840 --> 3:34:45.720]  and they're going to, you know, search,
[3:34:45.720 --> 3:34:47.520]  and it's going to bring more media attention.
[3:34:47.520 --> 3:34:50.640]  And this is the problem, is they want to take away your guns.
[3:34:50.640 --> 3:34:54.880]  They do not want you to have any sort of protection.
[3:34:54.880 --> 3:34:56.840]  And that's why, in this day and age,
[3:34:56.840 --> 3:34:58.840]  you really do need to be armed.
[3:34:58.840 --> 3:35:00.120]  You need to be ready.
[3:35:00.120 --> 3:35:03.000]  And in the Ukraine, the same people on the left are like,
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:04.160]  oh, I hate guns.
[3:35:04.160 --> 3:35:05.200]  I hate guns.
[3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:07.560]  Yet, to a citizen in Ukraine, they're just handing them out.
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:08.520]  Oh, here's a gun.
[3:35:08.520 --> 3:35:09.520]  Here's a gun.
[3:35:09.520 --> 3:35:10.720]  Because why?
[3:35:10.720 --> 3:35:13.880]  Because a gun is your last line of defense
[3:35:13.880 --> 3:35:17.480]  against tyranny, against a war, against something happening
[3:35:17.480 --> 3:35:20.200]  to your family, to your loved ones, to your pets.
[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:22.320]  So we really need to protect ourselves.
[3:35:22.320 --> 3:35:26.160]  And this is the saddest part about it,
[3:35:26.160 --> 3:35:30.200]  is we have people in leadership positions, like the ATF.
[3:35:30.200 --> 3:35:32.080]  And we know these alphabet agencies
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:34.880]  are so full of garbage.
[3:35:34.880 --> 3:35:38.840]  Look at the Gretchen Whitmer case right now.
[3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:41.400]  Everybody, all the charges have been dropped.
[3:35:41.400 --> 3:35:44.240]  And the same FBI people, these are all
[3:35:44.240 --> 3:35:47.120]  what we call agent provocateurs, similar to what
[3:35:47.120 --> 3:35:48.600]  happened on January 6.
[3:35:48.600 --> 3:35:50.840]  All of those people that were involved in it
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:54.320]  that basically entrapped these American patriots
[3:35:54.320 --> 3:35:59.280]  into a fake plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer,
[3:35:59.280 --> 3:36:01.840]  they actually got promoted.
[3:36:01.840 --> 3:36:05.440]  The same people that ran that investigation got promoted.
[3:36:05.440 --> 3:36:08.360]  It's very similar to after 9-11, if you believe
[3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:10.120]  the official story, which you shouldn't.
[3:36:10.120 --> 3:36:12.640]  The same people that let those towers fell down,
[3:36:12.640 --> 3:36:14.320]  none of them lost their job.
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:16.440]  They all got promoted.
[3:36:16.440 --> 3:36:19.920]  So to bring that back around to New York City,
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:21.400]  I was just recently there.
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:22.960]  And if you do watch Fox News, you
[3:36:22.960 --> 3:36:25.040]  watch the conservative media, they
[3:36:25.040 --> 3:36:28.320]  will describe New York as this dystopian hellhole.
[3:36:28.320 --> 3:36:30.960]  And I would have to tend to agree with them a little bit.
[3:36:30.960 --> 3:36:35.320]  But in my short time there, it wasn't as bad as I expected.
[3:36:35.320 --> 3:36:38.520]  But as I say that, as I say that,
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:42.080]  I went to what is called the New One World Trade Center.
[3:36:42.080 --> 3:36:44.120]  And it's called the One World Trade.
[3:36:44.120 --> 3:36:46.440]  And for me, that was a very emotional thing
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:51.520]  and to dial it into my point is one of the biggest wake-up
[3:36:51.520 --> 3:36:55.720]  calls in my entire life was finding out the truth about 9-11
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:36:58.360]  and that it was orchestrated by people within our own government
[3:36:58.360 --> 3:37:00.960]  in order to create a never ending war in the Middle East
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:02.880]  and destabilize the seven biggest countries that
[3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:05.360]  were a threat to Israel and Saudi Arabia.
[3:37:05.360 --> 3:37:08.920]  So when I look at the globalization of the world,
[3:37:08.920 --> 3:37:10.080]  they are mocking us.
[3:37:10.080 --> 3:37:13.040]  They go from the Twin Towers, two towers,
[3:37:13.040 --> 3:37:15.720]  into the One World Trade Center.
[3:37:15.720 --> 3:37:16.920]  And that's what they want, guys.
[3:37:16.920 --> 3:37:18.680]  They want us under one ruler.
[3:37:18.680 --> 3:37:21.440]  They want it to be one world.
[3:37:21.440 --> 3:37:24.200]  And when we become a group of one,
[3:37:24.200 --> 3:37:26.160]  the system will fail.
[3:37:26.160 --> 3:37:28.360]  That is a very bleak future.
[3:37:28.360 --> 3:37:31.840]  We need as much small government and as many different
[3:37:31.840 --> 3:37:36.320]  governments as possible because their plan is basically
[3:37:36.320 --> 3:37:38.320]  based out of the Bible.
[3:37:38.320 --> 3:37:41.160]  It's Genesis chapter 11, verse 9.
[3:37:41.160 --> 3:37:44.320]  In that, that is the story of the Tower of Babel.
[3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:47.000]  And Nimrod wanted to build a tower
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:49.600]  to the kingdom of heaven to go kill God.
[3:37:49.600 --> 3:37:50.800]  And what did God do?
[3:37:50.800 --> 3:37:52.800]  He made everybody speak different languages,
[3:37:52.800 --> 3:37:54.840]  broke them up in separate tribes so they were not
[3:37:54.840 --> 3:37:56.080]  able to communicate.
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:37:57.680]  And then they were not able to achieve
[3:37:57.680 --> 3:37:59.920]  Nimrod, the Satanic figures plan.
[3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:01.680]  Now, what's happening now when you look at things
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:03.120]  like the One World Trade Center?
[3:38:03.120 --> 3:38:07.320]  That is the reverse engineered plan of Nimrod.
[3:38:07.320 --> 3:38:11.760]  They want you under one ruler, one language,
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:13.360]  no borders, just all.
[3:38:13.360 --> 3:38:16.200]  Everybody's under the same country.
[3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:20.960]  And then that means Satan is calling the shots.
[3:38:20.960 --> 3:38:22.240]  And that's what we have to fight.
[3:38:22.240 --> 3:38:24.240]  It's a battle of good versus evil.
[3:38:24.240 --> 3:38:26.120]  I tell this story all the time.
[3:38:26.120 --> 3:38:29.000]  And I know that good, at the end of the day,
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:30.120]  good is going to win.
[3:38:30.120 --> 3:38:31.920]  But it's not going to be an easy win.
[3:38:31.920 --> 3:38:33.920]  It's going to be 39 to 38.
[3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:35.920]  It's going to be a barn burner.
[3:38:35.920 --> 3:38:39.160]  And that's why we have to support the Info War.
[3:38:39.160 --> 3:38:41.160]  We have to support each other.
[3:38:41.160 --> 3:38:43.000]  We have to love one another.
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:46.440]  And I'm not trying to sound colloquial or anecdotal.
[3:38:46.440 --> 3:38:47.840]  Oh, we've got to spread love.
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:38:50.520]  But they want to keep us in this negative vibrational state.
[3:38:50.520 --> 3:38:53.560]  They want to keep you in a constant state of fight or flight
[3:38:53.560 --> 3:38:55.480]  so that you are able to be manipulated,
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:38:57.800]  so that when you read the desk girl on CNN,
[3:38:57.800 --> 3:38:59.240]  you're like, oh, I'm so scared.
[3:38:59.240 --> 3:39:00.920]  I'm going to put on all my mask.
[3:39:00.920 --> 3:39:02.920]  And I'm going to take all my boosters.
[3:39:02.920 --> 3:39:05.120]  I'm so nervous.
[3:39:05.120 --> 3:39:06.560]  They don't want you healthy.
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:07.520]  They want you depressed.
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:09.320]  And if you go to your doctor and you say,
[3:39:09.320 --> 3:39:11.240]  you know, I'm having anxiety and depression,
[3:39:11.240 --> 3:39:14.160]  they're going to give you SSRIs that make you
[3:39:14.160 --> 3:39:16.800]  have suicidal idolization.
[3:39:16.800 --> 3:39:19.560]  If they cared about you, why would they give a suicidal
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:22.320]  person medicine that makes them more suicide?
[3:39:22.320 --> 3:39:23.120]  More suicidal?
[3:39:23.120 --> 3:39:24.520]  It doesn't make sense.
[3:39:24.520 --> 3:39:27.120]  Because we live in a world that doesn't care about you.
[3:39:27.120 --> 3:39:29.360]  They don't. The only person that's going to care about you
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:29.960]  is you.
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:32.560]  And that's why we have to take self-accountability.
[3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:34.760]  That's why we have to do something now.
[3:39:34.760 --> 3:39:36.720]  We have to strike why the iron is hot.
[3:39:36.720 --> 3:39:38.280]  People just went through this pandemic
[3:39:38.280 --> 3:39:40.360]  and people are waking up.
[3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:42.920]  I've been awake for a little bit longer than most people,
[3:39:42.920 --> 3:39:45.800]  but that's still relatively new compared to people
[3:39:45.800 --> 3:39:47.520]  like Alex, compared to a lot of the people that
[3:39:47.520 --> 3:39:48.640]  are working on the crew.
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:50.640]  So I'm saying, there's levels to this.
[3:39:50.640 --> 3:39:52.840]  There's levels to your awakening.
[3:39:52.840 --> 3:39:55.120]  So it's hard to go to your family and be like, oh,
[3:39:55.120 --> 3:39:57.120]  you know, 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:39:58.840]  Of course, they're going to look at you like a goofball.
[3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:00.600]  They're going to say, oh, well, that's crazy.
[3:40:00.600 --> 3:40:02.280]  But that's not why we give them that.
[3:40:02.280 --> 3:40:05.320]  What we try to do is we try to, what I try to do
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:08.840]  is I try to jam the crazies left culture in their face.
[3:40:08.840 --> 3:40:10.160]  It's called culture jamming.
[3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:13.200]  And you look at situations like Leah Thomas.
[3:40:13.200 --> 3:40:16.120]  Leah Thomas was a boy, and I talked about this earlier
[3:40:16.120 --> 3:40:19.800]  with Owen, that swam on the boys' University of Pennsylvania
[3:40:19.800 --> 3:40:23.520]  swim team for three years, then decided
[3:40:23.520 --> 3:40:26.520]  that now William is Leah.
[3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:29.680]  And Leah is going to take hormone therapy.
[3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:31.960]  And Leah is going to join the girls team.
[3:40:31.960 --> 3:40:34.600]  And Leah is going to go to the NCAA Championships
[3:40:34.600 --> 3:40:36.320]  and not only compete, but she's going
[3:40:36.320 --> 3:40:39.440]  to win two events first place.
[3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:43.920]  But unfortunately, Leah still has male genitalia.
[3:40:43.920 --> 3:40:48.280]  Leah is still 6'5", 215 pounds,
[3:40:48.280 --> 3:40:51.320]  and is built different than any other competitor.
[3:40:51.320 --> 3:40:52.880]  But the mainstream media is going
[3:40:52.880 --> 3:40:56.040]  to look at you in your face and say, oh, this is good.
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:57.960]  This is progressive.
[3:40:57.960 --> 3:41:00.200]  Guys, the progression that we are heading
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:02.000]  is a dystopian nightmare.
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:06.800]  This is not progress, letting the boys swim with the girls.
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:08.520]  That is part of the plan.
[3:41:08.520 --> 3:41:12.640]  In the future, they want us all to be one race and one sex.
[3:41:12.640 --> 3:41:14.400]  That's why they say, oh, they don't even.
[3:41:14.400 --> 3:41:17.080]  Can Taji Brown Jackson, the new Supreme Court Justice,
[3:41:17.080 --> 3:41:20.480]  when they just asked her a simple question,
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:22.240]  she can't even define a woman.
[3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:25.480]  She says, well, I'm not a biologist.
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:27.920]  So she even admits that it takes biology
[3:41:27.920 --> 3:41:30.680]  to decide what a boy and girl is.
[3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:32.240]  And it's very simple, guys.
[3:41:32.240 --> 3:41:33.960]  A girl has her period.
[3:41:33.960 --> 3:41:35.920]  A girl can have a baby.
[3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:37.560]  A boy can't.
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:39.840]  All you need to watch is a movie, Kindergarten Cop,
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:41.680]  with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[3:41:41.680 --> 3:41:43.880]  Girls have a vagina, boys have a penis.
[3:41:43.880 --> 3:41:45.160]  It's that simple.
[3:41:45.160 --> 3:41:48.160]  But they want to blur the lines to keep you
[3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:50.080]  in this constant state of confusion.
[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:52.960]  So you have no idea what is up, what is down.
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:41:56.680]  Even these people, one of the most honorable lifetime judges,
[3:41:56.680 --> 3:42:00.840]  one of the highest positions that you can possibly be,
[3:42:00.840 --> 3:42:02.880]  can't even do a simple definition
[3:42:02.880 --> 3:42:05.800]  of the difference between a boy and a girl.
[3:42:05.800 --> 3:42:07.520]  And you're like, Alex, why are you yelling and screaming?
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:09.920]  Because this is sad, this is sick.
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:11.560]  It makes me sick.
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:14.120]  I come up here, and the people that are put
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:16.000]  on a pedestal, Joe Biden, you look at,
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  we need to pull up the clip.
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:19.040]  Saudi Arabia, everybody's making fun of,
[3:42:19.040 --> 3:42:20.480]  there's a viral clip right now,
[3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:22.520]  could basically just bashing Joe Biden
[3:42:22.520 --> 3:42:24.800]  about how dumb he is and how incompetent he is
[3:42:24.800 --> 3:42:26.600]  and how incompetent Kamala Harris is.
[3:42:26.600 --> 3:42:28.960]  So these people that are in the most high,
[3:42:28.960 --> 3:42:31.840]  powerful positions, all are idiots,
[3:42:31.840 --> 3:42:33.520]  and they're not there on accident.
[3:42:33.520 --> 3:42:35.680]  They're placed there by people like George Soros,
[3:42:35.680 --> 3:42:39.720]  people like Bill Gates, these people like Klaus Schwab,
[3:42:39.720 --> 3:42:42.320]  these puppets that are ruining the world, guys,
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:44.120]  and we're gonna expose all of that.
[3:42:44.120 --> 3:42:45.560]  So stay tuned after the break,
[3:42:45.560 --> 3:42:47.200]  and we got a lot more to talk about,
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:50.000]  but I just want to say, we got to wake up
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:51.200]  before it is too late.
[3:42:51.200 --> 3:42:53.800]  We're gonna see you guys on the other side of the break.
[3:42:56.520 --> 3:42:58.200]  It was about 25 years ago
[3:42:58.200 --> 3:42:59.720]  that I wanted to expand in for worse.
[3:42:59.720 --> 3:43:00.840]  I've been on the air a couple of years,
[3:43:00.840 --> 3:43:03.360]  but I only had money to finance my own
[3:43:03.360 --> 3:43:05.240]  simple little local radio show.
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:07.280]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films,
[3:43:07.280 --> 3:43:09.640]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[3:43:09.640 --> 3:43:12.120]  And it was a T-shirt I designed, the first one,
[3:43:12.120 --> 3:43:14.880]  Mass Murderers Agree, Gun Control Works,
[3:43:14.880 --> 3:43:17.520]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members
[3:43:17.520 --> 3:43:18.440]  of my crew.
[3:43:18.440 --> 3:43:20.880]  That's our oldest design that we're still selling.
[3:43:20.880 --> 3:43:23.160]  We have that design over 100 others
[3:43:23.160 --> 3:43:25.040]  that will now all be limited editions,
[3:43:25.040 --> 3:43:26.760]  because whatever stock we've got in,
[3:43:26.760 --> 3:43:29.600]  that's it, we're selling everything out
[3:43:29.600 --> 3:43:32.160]  to find the operation, to get rid of inventory.
[3:43:32.160 --> 3:43:33.720]  We'll still have some teachers in the future,
[3:43:33.720 --> 3:43:35.920]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[3:43:35.920 --> 3:43:38.360]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts,
[3:43:38.360 --> 3:43:40.800]  this is your last chance, I almost forgot.
[3:43:40.800 --> 3:43:44.480]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[3:43:44.480 --> 3:43:47.480]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie,

[3:43:51.120 --> 3:43:55.120]  they're all selling at cost, infowarstore.com.
[3:43:59.120 --> 3:44:01.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[3:44:01.000 --> 3:44:02.280]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[3:44:02.280 --> 3:44:03.120]  Good, bro.
[3:44:03.120 --> 3:44:03.960]  Great last caller.
[3:44:03.960 --> 3:44:07.080]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[3:44:07.080 --> 3:44:09.640]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore,
[3:44:09.640 --> 3:44:12.880]  with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[3:44:12.880 --> 3:44:14.720]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[3:44:14.720 --> 3:44:16.440]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:17.800]  Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[3:44:17.800 --> 3:44:19.320]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[3:44:19.320 --> 3:44:21.160]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[3:44:21.160 --> 3:44:22.360]  for the point of the product.
[3:44:22.360 --> 3:44:24.040]  The XQ does wonders.
[3:44:24.040 --> 3:44:25.280]  I recommend it to everybody.
[3:44:25.280 --> 3:44:27.160]  You're on the fence about it, get off the fence,
[3:44:27.160 --> 3:44:29.240]  get the product, support the infowar.
[3:44:29.240 --> 3:44:31.120]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[3:44:31.120 --> 3:44:32.120]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[3:44:32.120 --> 3:44:34.560]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you, it's an honor.
[3:44:34.560 --> 3:44:35.400]  Honored to talk to you.
[3:44:35.400 --> 3:44:36.480]  Awesome.
[3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:38.760]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say,
[3:44:38.760 --> 3:44:42.160]  I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[3:44:42.160 --> 3:44:44.400]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[3:44:44.400 --> 3:44:46.000]  All right, it helps in the bedroom.
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:47.880]  So, just number one for a few of us there.
[3:44:47.880 --> 3:44:50.240]  Oh, it definitely works, it's not a joke.
[3:44:50.240 --> 3:44:51.080]  Absolutely.
[3:44:56.520 --> 3:44:58.240]  It was about 25 years ago
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:44:59.760]  that I wanted to expand InfoWars.
[3:44:59.760 --> 3:45:00.880]  I've been on the air a couple of years,
[3:45:00.880 --> 3:45:03.400]  but I only had money to finance my own
[3:45:03.400 --> 3:45:05.280]  simple little local radio show.
[3:45:05.280 --> 3:45:07.320]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films,
[3:45:07.320 --> 3:45:09.680]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[3:45:09.680 --> 3:45:12.120]  And it was a t-shirt I designed, the first one,
[3:45:12.120 --> 3:45:14.920]  mass murderers agree gun control works
[3:45:14.920 --> 3:45:16.760]  that helped us finance hiring
[3:45:16.760 --> 3:45:18.480]  the first two members of my crew.
[3:45:18.480 --> 3:45:20.920]  That's our oldest design that we're still selling.
[3:45:20.920 --> 3:45:23.200]  We have that design over 100 others
[3:45:23.200 --> 3:45:25.080]  that will now all be limited editions

[3:45:32.240 --> 3:45:33.760]  We'll still have some teachers in the future,
[3:45:33.760 --> 3:45:35.960]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[3:45:35.960 --> 3:45:38.400]  So, if you want to get any of these historic shirts,
[3:45:38.400 --> 3:45:40.840]  this is your last chance, what I almost forgot.

[3:46:56.840 --> 3:46:59.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:46:59.640 --> 3:47:03.240]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:03.240 --> 3:47:05.240]  The time is flying by.
[3:47:05.240 --> 3:47:08.120]  This is one of our last segments for prime time,
[3:47:08.120 --> 3:47:11.440]  9 to 9, filling in for the king himself, Alex Jones,
[3:47:11.440 --> 3:47:14.440]  and I want to start off by talking about in Tennessee, guys.
[3:47:14.440 --> 3:47:15.920]  They just made it right now.
[3:47:15.920 --> 3:47:18.880]  You can get ivermectin without a prescription,
[3:47:18.880 --> 3:47:20.840]  and why that is a big deal is you look at countries
[3:47:20.840 --> 3:47:24.440]  like Nigeria that have had some of the lowest rates of COVID.
[3:47:24.440 --> 3:47:27.240]  In that country, they often make a mistake
[3:47:27.240 --> 3:47:29.720]  and they're not going to be able to get it.
[3:47:29.720 --> 3:47:33.440]  They have the lowest rates of COVID, in that country,
[3:47:33.440 --> 3:47:37.120]  they often prescribe ivermectin as just basically given
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:39.760]  because they have so many river issues,
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:42.120]  they have a lot of bacterial issues there,
[3:47:42.120 --> 3:47:45.040]  so they give it to their people, it's just a common thing.
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:48.640]  And we know that Alex, one of his most viral things
[3:47:48.640 --> 3:47:52.440]  he ever did was taking a little ivermectin on air,
[3:47:52.440 --> 3:47:56.200]  so in honor of him, I got a little bit of the sniffles,
[3:47:56.200 --> 3:47:59.520]  as you say, and I love this apple flavor.
[3:47:59.520 --> 3:48:01.520]  There's a lot of human on this, guys.
[3:48:01.520 --> 3:48:03.520]  Where does it say apple?
[3:48:03.520 --> 3:48:07.520]  Right here. This is what it's all about, baby.
[3:48:07.520 --> 3:48:09.520]  It's that apple flavor.
[3:48:09.520 --> 3:48:11.520]  So I want to show you guys, this is all it takes.
[3:48:11.520 --> 3:48:13.520]  I'm not in Tennessee. Sadly, here in Texas,
[3:48:13.520 --> 3:48:15.520]  I can't go get my ivermectin.
[3:48:15.520 --> 3:48:17.520]  They want me to get the COVID.
[3:48:17.520 --> 3:48:19.520]  They want me to go get on a ventilator, and they want me to die.
[3:48:19.520 --> 3:48:21.520]  But guess what? I'm going to do a little...
[3:48:21.520 --> 3:48:23.520]  This is a little primetime 99-Alex sign,
[3:48:23.520 --> 3:48:25.520]  and this is a little Nigerian trick.
[3:48:25.520 --> 3:48:27.520]  I learned this in Nigeria.
[3:48:27.520 --> 3:48:29.520]  You get it on there in the apple flavor.
[3:48:29.520 --> 3:48:31.520]  This is for you. This is for AJ.
[3:48:31.520 --> 3:48:33.520]  The New World Order.
[3:48:33.520 --> 3:48:35.520]  They're not going to get me.
[3:48:35.520 --> 3:48:37.520]  Mmm! Mmm!
[3:48:37.520 --> 3:48:39.520]  Delicious!
[3:48:39.520 --> 3:48:41.520]  Yay! Yay!
[3:48:41.520 --> 3:48:43.520]  I think that's just how you have to react
[3:48:43.520 --> 3:48:45.520]  after you take a little ivermectin.
[3:48:45.520 --> 3:48:47.520]  But...
[3:48:47.520 --> 3:48:49.520]  Man, that goes down very smooth.
[3:48:49.520 --> 3:48:51.520]  But I wanted to bring a little ivermectin awareness
[3:48:51.520 --> 3:48:53.520]  and congratulate Tennessee
[3:48:53.520 --> 3:48:55.520]  for being based in reality.
[3:48:55.520 --> 3:48:57.520]  That's what I'm talking about. I love it.
[3:48:57.520 --> 3:48:59.520]  We got to be a little more based in reality
[3:48:59.520 --> 3:49:01.520]  and actually let people have access to this stuff.
[3:49:01.520 --> 3:49:03.520]  Because in other countries,
[3:49:03.520 --> 3:49:05.520]  you can just get it over the counter.
[3:49:05.520 --> 3:49:07.520]  But here in America, if Big Pharma can't tax you
[3:49:07.520 --> 3:49:09.520]  and can't make money off it,
[3:49:09.520 --> 3:49:11.520]  then you can't get it.
[3:49:11.520 --> 3:49:13.520]  And sadly, that's the problem.
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:15.520]  These multinational corporations, they got all the money in the world.
[3:49:15.520 --> 3:49:17.520]  They don't even need money, guys. They got it all.
[3:49:17.520 --> 3:49:19.520]  And you look at Apple.
[3:49:19.520 --> 3:49:21.520]  They're one of the biggest companies in the world.
[3:49:21.520 --> 3:49:23.520]  And you know how they treat their employees at their Foxconn factory?
[3:49:23.520 --> 3:49:25.520]  They have suicide nets
[3:49:25.520 --> 3:49:27.520]  because so many people are jumping off it.
[3:49:27.520 --> 3:49:29.520]  So that's how much these companies care about you.
[3:49:29.520 --> 3:49:31.520]  They're so empathetic.
[3:49:31.520 --> 3:49:33.520]  Their own employees are jumping off their
[3:49:33.520 --> 3:49:35.520]  factory, killing themselves.
[3:49:35.520 --> 3:49:37.520]  And the best way that they can come up with
[3:49:37.520 --> 3:49:39.520]  combatting it is building nets
[3:49:39.520 --> 3:49:41.520]  to catch them when they fall off.
[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:43.520]  So this is the day and age that we live in.
[3:49:43.520 --> 3:49:45.520]  When the most powerful company
[3:49:45.520 --> 3:49:47.520]  in the world that has the most money
[3:49:47.520 --> 3:49:49.520]  can't even support their own
[3:49:49.520 --> 3:49:51.520]  employees enough to make it
[3:49:51.520 --> 3:49:53.520]  to kill themselves while they're at work.
[3:49:53.520 --> 3:49:55.520]  And really and truly,
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:49:57.520]  this is just a good indication of what's happening
[3:49:57.520 --> 3:49:59.520]  in our world today.
[3:49:59.520 --> 3:50:01.520]  Sadly, it's not very much different
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:03.520]  than when you go to your doctor and you say,
[3:50:03.520 --> 3:50:05.520]  oh, I'm suffering from depression, and they give you the SSRI
[3:50:05.520 --> 3:50:07.520]  that is going to make you have suicidal thoughts.
[3:50:07.520 --> 3:50:09.520]  Okay, guys.
[3:50:09.520 --> 3:50:11.520]  I've been saying guys a lot. I apologize
[3:50:11.520 --> 3:50:13.520]  for that. I'm just so excited to be here.
[3:50:13.520 --> 3:50:15.520]  And I know my time is running short.
[3:50:15.520 --> 3:50:17.520]  So if you guys enjoy this, you know, please let the crew,
[3:50:17.520 --> 3:50:19.520]  you know, please let Alex
[3:50:19.520 --> 3:50:21.520]  actually know that you enjoyed my time.
[3:50:21.520 --> 3:50:23.520]  But I want to talk about this.
[3:50:23.520 --> 3:50:25.520]  I kind of want to end it on this.
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:27.520]  Right now in Plano, Texas,
[3:50:27.520 --> 3:50:29.520]  a few of my viral videos have really
[3:50:29.520 --> 3:50:31.520]  shaken the mayor
[3:50:31.520 --> 3:50:33.520]  and the council members to their core.
[3:50:33.520 --> 3:50:35.520]  And they're actually making it.
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:37.520]  They're changing the rules and making it where now
[3:50:37.520 --> 3:50:39.520]  you can only speak for one minute.
[3:50:39.520 --> 3:50:41.520]  And they're also putting the public comment
[3:50:41.520 --> 3:50:43.520]  at the end of the meeting.
[3:50:43.520 --> 3:50:45.520]  So how are we going to combat this?
[3:50:45.520 --> 3:50:47.520]  And they're actually, on top of all that,
[3:50:47.520 --> 3:50:49.520]  in two weeks,
[3:50:49.520 --> 3:50:51.520]  to get rid of the public comment altogether
[3:50:51.520 --> 3:50:53.520]  so that they can do it at a special meeting
[3:50:53.520 --> 3:50:55.520]  that isn't recorded.
[3:50:55.520 --> 3:50:57.520]  So they are scared to death.
[3:50:57.520 --> 3:50:59.520]  So we are making a difference.
[3:50:59.520 --> 3:51:01.520]  So this, what I'm doing right now is a call to action.
[3:51:01.520 --> 3:51:03.520]  I want to try to get anybody,
[3:51:03.520 --> 3:51:05.520]  it doesn't matter what your grievance is.
[3:51:05.520 --> 3:51:07.520]  It can be something small.
[3:51:07.520 --> 3:51:09.520]  It can be something serious.
[3:51:09.520 --> 3:51:11.520]  You don't have to put on a woman's bathing suit
[3:51:11.520 --> 3:51:13.520]  and go up there and mock Leah Thomas.
[3:51:13.520 --> 3:51:15.520]  You can talk about something serious.
[3:51:15.520 --> 3:51:17.520]  But I want everybody in the world
[3:51:17.520 --> 3:51:19.520]  to go out there
[3:51:19.520 --> 3:51:21.520]  and speak and call out these politicians.
[3:51:21.520 --> 3:51:23.520]  Because what happens
[3:51:23.520 --> 3:51:25.520]  when these people get elected, all of a sudden
[3:51:25.520 --> 3:51:27.520]  they think that we work for them.
[3:51:27.520 --> 3:51:29.520]  That's not the case. They work for us.
[3:51:29.520 --> 3:51:31.520]  You need to let them know.
[3:51:31.520 --> 3:51:33.520]  You need to go. All you got to do is a simple
[3:51:33.520 --> 3:51:35.520]  Google search, whatever city you're living.
[3:51:35.520 --> 3:51:37.520]  How to sign up at ABCD.
[3:51:37.520 --> 3:51:39.520]  How to sign up at the Tallahassee City Council.
[3:51:39.520 --> 3:51:41.520]  I guarantee you the first thing
[3:51:41.520 --> 3:51:43.520]  that comes up on Google is going to be a link.
[3:51:43.520 --> 3:51:45.520]  How to do it. I'm not a genius.
[3:51:45.520 --> 3:51:47.520]  If I can figure out how to speak all these meetings,
[3:51:47.520 --> 3:51:49.520]  I promise you guys can figure this out too.
[3:51:49.520 --> 3:51:51.520]  And we need to do a call to action.
[3:51:51.520 --> 3:51:53.520]  We need as many people standing up
[3:51:53.520 --> 3:51:55.520]  to these politicians.
[3:51:55.520 --> 3:51:57.520]  You know, Alex, well, I don't have the same, you know,
[3:51:57.520 --> 3:51:59.520]  ability to you to public speak
[3:51:59.520 --> 3:52:01.520]  or embarrass yourself.
[3:52:01.520 --> 3:52:03.520]  It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
[3:52:03.520 --> 3:52:05.520]  Me going to Plano, Texas over three months
[3:52:05.520 --> 3:52:07.520]  has made them change their rules
[3:52:07.520 --> 3:52:09.520]  that they've had in place for years.
[3:52:09.520 --> 3:52:11.520]  So we can shake up the system
[3:52:11.520 --> 3:52:13.520]  and the reason why we need to shake it up
[3:52:13.520 --> 3:52:15.520]  at a local level, because guys like George Soros,
[3:52:15.520 --> 3:52:17.520]  they are the people that are funding the district attorneys.
[3:52:17.520 --> 3:52:19.520]  They are the people that are picking the county judge
[3:52:19.520 --> 3:52:21.520]  that are all rigged against you.
[3:52:21.520 --> 3:52:23.520]  So you need to stand up against this tyranny
[3:52:23.520 --> 3:52:25.520]  and you can do it.
[3:52:25.520 --> 3:52:27.520]  You don't need to live in fear.
[3:52:27.520 --> 3:52:29.520]  They want you to be afraid.
[3:52:29.520 --> 3:52:31.520]  Your life is going to be short
[3:52:31.520 --> 3:52:33.520]  and really and truly life is almost meaningless
[3:52:33.520 --> 3:52:35.520]  unless we leave our legacy on this earth
[3:52:35.520 --> 3:52:37.520]  and you can leave your legacy here
[3:52:37.520 --> 3:52:39.520]  on this earth by standing up
[3:52:39.520 --> 3:52:41.520]  to the tyrannical nightmare
[3:52:41.520 --> 3:52:43.520]  that we're currently under
[3:52:43.520 --> 3:52:45.520]  and the lower the level, the better it is.
[3:52:45.520 --> 3:52:47.520]  And why do you think that is?
[3:52:47.520 --> 3:52:49.520]  Because it goes...
[3:52:49.520 --> 3:52:51.520]  it's a reverse funnel.
[3:52:51.520 --> 3:52:53.520]  When they know at the lower level
[3:52:53.520 --> 3:52:55.520]  that people are standing up, it scares them.
[3:52:55.520 --> 3:52:57.520]  Then all these people, all these mayors,
[3:52:57.520 --> 3:52:59.520]  they talk to other politicians
[3:52:59.520 --> 3:53:01.520]  and that's what's happening.
[3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:03.520]  There's a coordinated effort to try to silence me.
[3:53:03.520 --> 3:53:05.520]  I'm just one man.
[3:53:05.520 --> 3:53:07.520]  I know I'm prime time, nananan
[3:53:07.520 --> 3:53:09.520]  and I got to ego and I talk to talk
[3:53:09.520 --> 3:53:11.520]  and I do all the jazz.
[3:53:11.520 --> 3:53:13.520]  There's a lot of jazz with prime time, nananan.
[3:53:13.520 --> 3:53:15.520]  But I'm just a normal guy.
[3:53:15.520 --> 3:53:17.520]  I put on my pants one leg at a time
[3:53:17.520 --> 3:53:19.520]  just like you.
[3:53:19.520 --> 3:53:21.520]  You can do this too.
[3:53:21.520 --> 3:53:23.520]  You can shake up the system.
[3:53:23.520 --> 3:53:25.520]  If me and Cassidy Campbell
[3:53:25.520 --> 3:53:27.520]  can make a mayor of a prime city
[3:53:27.520 --> 3:53:29.520]  with a million people in it
[3:53:29.520 --> 3:53:31.520]  scared to death when we walk in the room
[3:53:31.520 --> 3:53:33.520]  their eyes look like dinner plates.
[3:53:33.520 --> 3:53:35.520]  You can do it too
[3:53:35.520 --> 3:53:37.520]  because everybody else lives
[3:53:37.520 --> 3:53:39.520]  in that constant state of fear.
[3:53:39.520 --> 3:53:41.520]  Everybody else is in a constant state
[3:53:41.520 --> 3:53:43.520]  of trauma-based mind control
[3:53:43.520 --> 3:53:45.520]  and they're too scared.
[3:53:45.520 --> 3:53:47.520]  They're afraid of the repercussions.
[3:53:47.520 --> 3:53:49.520]  But you need to be unapologetically yourself.
[3:53:49.520 --> 3:53:51.520]  You don't need to apologize
[3:53:51.520 --> 3:53:53.520]  for being you.
[3:53:53.520 --> 3:53:55.520]  You don't need to apologize
[3:53:55.520 --> 3:53:57.520]  for being yourself.
[3:53:57.520 --> 3:53:59.520]  They want you to fit into
[3:53:59.520 --> 3:54:01.520]  they want to make you fit inside of a block
[3:54:01.520 --> 3:54:03.520]  inside of a square.
[3:54:03.520 --> 3:54:05.520]  I don't do that.
[3:54:05.520 --> 3:54:07.520]  I think outside the box
[3:54:07.520 --> 3:54:09.520]  or Taco Bell used to say
[3:54:09.520 --> 3:54:11.520]  I think outside the bun.
[3:54:11.520 --> 3:54:13.520]  That's a brilliant saying.
[3:54:13.520 --> 3:54:15.520]  I know you're talking about Taco Bell
[3:54:15.520 --> 3:54:17.520]  but I'm just trying to use it as a metaphor
[3:54:17.520 --> 3:54:19.520]  is that we have to be different.
[3:54:19.520 --> 3:54:21.520]  We have to try something new.
[3:54:21.520 --> 3:54:23.520]  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing
[3:54:23.520 --> 3:54:25.520]  over and over and expecting a different result.
[3:54:25.520 --> 3:54:27.520]  And currently that's what's going on.
[3:54:27.520 --> 3:54:29.520]  We're doing the same thing.
[3:54:29.520 --> 3:54:31.520]  We know Joe Biden is a puppet.
[3:54:31.520 --> 3:54:33.520]  But nobody's standing up to these people.
[3:54:33.520 --> 3:54:35.520]  So where can you stand up?
[3:54:35.520 --> 3:54:37.520]  You stand up to your local mayor.
[3:54:37.520 --> 3:54:39.520]  You stand up to your local council member
[3:54:39.520 --> 3:54:41.520]  and that will bleed its way up
[3:54:41.520 --> 3:54:43.520]  because that fear that these politicians have
[3:54:43.520 --> 3:54:45.520]  will spread
[3:54:45.520 --> 3:54:47.520]  and our energy will spread too
[3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:49.520]  because sadly when you're in that low vibrational state
[3:54:49.520 --> 3:54:51.520]  misery loves company
[3:54:51.520 --> 3:54:53.520]  it attracts more misery.
[3:54:53.520 --> 3:54:55.520]  But if you cannot live in fear
[3:54:55.520 --> 3:54:57.520]  and you can rise up to that high vibrational energy
[3:54:57.520 --> 3:54:59.520]  like I have
[3:54:59.520 --> 3:55:01.520]  or high vibrational energy
[3:55:01.520 --> 3:55:03.520]  and then you can actually have some joy in your life
[3:55:03.520 --> 3:55:05.520]  so we need to take the worst parts
[3:55:05.520 --> 3:55:07.520]  of our culture and jam it in their face
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:09.520]  to wake up people
[3:55:09.520 --> 3:55:11.520]  to what is really going on.
[3:55:11.520 --> 3:55:13.520]  One of the most effective things that Cassidy and I
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:15.520]  and I bring up Cassidy and Campbell
[3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:17.520]  because he's a partner in crime of mine
[3:55:17.520 --> 3:55:19.520]  we go out there and we try to wake people up
[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:21.520]  but we go out there and we fake canvas
[3:55:21.520 --> 3:55:23.520]  as Beto O'Rourke supporters
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:25.520]  and a lot of people say oh I support Beto
[3:55:25.520 --> 3:55:27.520]  and then you say hey well do you think
[3:55:27.520 --> 3:55:29.520]  6 year olds should be able to reassign their gender?
[3:55:29.520 --> 3:55:31.520]  Do you think 6 year olds should be able to take hormone blockers?
[3:55:31.520 --> 3:55:33.520]  Do you think 9 year olds should have
[3:55:33.520 --> 3:55:35.520]  gender reassignment surgery?
[3:55:35.520 --> 3:55:37.520]  And these people think well I don't know
[3:55:37.520 --> 3:55:39.520]  that sounds kind of bad.
[3:55:39.520 --> 3:55:41.520]  These are what these people want
[3:55:41.520 --> 3:55:43.520]  Beto O'Rourke's wearing a shirt protect trans kids.
[3:55:43.520 --> 3:55:45.520]  What the heck you need to protect all kids?
[3:55:45.520 --> 3:55:47.520]  We don't need to capitulate
[3:55:47.520 --> 3:55:49.520]  to the 1% that's what they want to do
[3:55:49.520 --> 3:55:51.520]  is they want to make 99%
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:53.520]  of the population bow down
[3:55:53.520 --> 3:55:55.520]  to less than 1%.
[3:55:55.520 --> 3:55:57.520]  They want to make every other female swimmer
[3:55:57.520 --> 3:55:59.520]  all 99% of them
[3:55:59.520 --> 3:56:01.520]  lose their ability
[3:56:01.520 --> 3:56:03.520]  to have or have a championship
[3:56:03.520 --> 3:56:05.520]  to less than 1% Leah Thomas
[3:56:05.520 --> 3:56:07.520]  because they have their thumb
[3:56:07.520 --> 3:56:09.520]  on the scale we live in a rig system
[3:56:09.520 --> 3:56:11.520]  and the only way we're ever going to fix it
[3:56:11.520 --> 3:56:13.520]  is if we stand up to the tyranny
[3:56:13.520 --> 3:56:15.520]  before it's too late
[3:56:15.520 --> 3:56:17.520]  and you need to spread
[3:56:17.520 --> 3:56:19.520]  this information far and wide
[3:56:19.520 --> 3:56:21.520]  you look at Alex he's been deep platform
[3:56:21.520 --> 3:56:23.520]  he's been lied about
[3:56:23.520 --> 3:56:25.520]  they have deleted him from the internet basically
[3:56:25.520 --> 3:56:27.520]  so you
[3:56:27.520 --> 3:56:29.520]  the best thing you can do to fight this culture
[3:56:29.520 --> 3:56:31.520]  you spread this information
[3:56:31.520 --> 3:56:33.520]  to your friends, to your family
[3:56:33.520 --> 3:56:35.520]  to whoever will listen
[3:56:35.520 --> 3:56:37.520]  because this is the information
[3:56:37.520 --> 3:56:39.520]  they don't want you to have
[3:56:39.520 --> 3:56:41.520]  they don't want you to know you can get ivermectin in Tennessee
[3:56:41.520 --> 3:56:43.520]  they don't want you to know that Bill Clinton
[3:56:43.520 --> 3:56:45.520]  was on the low leader express 26 times
[3:56:45.520 --> 3:56:47.520]  they don't want you to know Bill Gates' best friends
[3:56:47.520 --> 3:56:49.520]  with Jeffrey Epstein
[3:56:49.520 --> 3:56:51.520]  there's some serious stuff they don't want you to know
[3:56:51.520 --> 3:56:53.520]  they don't want to wake people up
[3:56:53.520 --> 3:56:55.520]  they don't want you to know about the CIA
[3:56:55.520 --> 3:56:57.520]  during the Iran Contra
[3:56:57.520 --> 3:56:59.520]  trading guns with Nicaragua for cocaine
[3:56:59.520 --> 3:57:01.520]  and then selling that cocaine
[3:57:01.520 --> 3:57:03.520]  to citizens of our own country
[3:57:03.520 --> 3:57:05.520]  and getting people creating a crack epidemic
[3:57:05.520 --> 3:57:07.520]  or the opioid epidemic created by
[3:57:07.520 --> 3:57:09.520]  the Pfizer pharmaceutical companies
[3:57:09.520 --> 3:57:11.520]  or the current fentanyl epidemic
[3:57:11.520 --> 3:57:13.520]  they don't want you to worry about that
[3:57:13.520 --> 3:57:15.520]  or the over 100,000 drug overdose deaths
[3:57:15.520 --> 3:57:17.520]  all they're going to do is tell you
[3:57:17.520 --> 3:57:19.520]  wear a mask, take your vaccine
[3:57:19.520 --> 3:57:21.520]  we are the vaccine to the new world order
[3:57:21.520 --> 3:57:23.520]  info wars is the new world order vaccine
[3:57:23.520 --> 3:57:25.520]  so if you like your vaccine
[3:57:25.520 --> 3:57:27.520]  you need to support the friggin info war
[3:57:27.520 --> 3:57:29.520]  before it's too late
[3:57:29.520 --> 3:57:31.520]  because right now
[3:57:31.520 --> 3:57:33.520]  the time
[3:57:33.520 --> 3:57:35.520]  to strike is why the iron is hot
[3:57:35.520 --> 3:57:37.520]  so I want to see you a call to action
[3:57:37.520 --> 3:57:39.520]  come and speak at any meeting
[3:57:39.520 --> 3:57:41.520]  any opportunity and try to

[3:57:43.520 --> 3:57:45.520]  thank you
[3:57:45.520 --> 3:57:47.520]  you know it's a fact and I'm out bragging when I say it
[3:57:47.520 --> 3:57:49.520]  it's just true that info wars
[3:57:49.520 --> 3:57:51.520]  is seen by the globalist as
[3:57:51.520 --> 3:57:53.520]  the standard of human liberty
[3:57:53.520 --> 3:57:55.520]  as the logo
[3:57:55.520 --> 3:57:57.520]  of human populace resistance
[3:57:57.520 --> 3:57:59.520]  against their transhumanist
[3:57:59.520 --> 3:58:01.520]  anti-human program
[3:58:01.520 --> 3:58:03.520]  and man our work is
[3:58:03.520 --> 3:58:05.520]  really right now hitting
[3:58:05.520 --> 3:58:07.520]  the most important aspects
[3:58:07.520 --> 3:58:09.520]  of what we've ever done
[3:58:09.520 --> 3:58:11.520]  so I'm asking listeners now
[3:58:11.520 --> 3:58:13.520]  to realize we've got great products

[3:58:23.520 --> 3:58:25.520]  don't need me to tell you that
[3:58:25.520 --> 3:58:27.520]  at infowarstore.com

[3:58:33.520 --> 3:58:35.520]  like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix
[3:58:35.520 --> 3:58:37.520]  that's so amazing and our new
[3:58:37.520 --> 3:58:39.520]  immune support formula that's so critical

[3:58:43.520 --> 3:58:45.520]  at infowarstore.com right now
[3:58:45.520 --> 3:58:47.520]  our world is so full of hype
[3:58:47.520 --> 3:58:49.520]  we are force fed
[3:58:49.520 --> 3:58:51.520]  dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media
[3:58:51.520 --> 3:58:53.520]  by the controlled churches
[3:58:53.520 --> 3:58:55.520]  and the universities
[3:58:55.520 --> 3:58:57.520]  why is this the case?
[3:58:57.520 --> 3:58:59.520]  because we innately, by God
[3:58:59.520 --> 3:59:01.520]  have been given the keys to our own minds
[3:59:01.520 --> 3:59:03.520]  our own psyches, our own souls
[3:59:03.520 --> 3:59:05.520]  and by connecting to God
[3:59:05.520 --> 3:59:07.520]  we can empower ourselves
[3:59:07.520 --> 3:59:09.520]  and transcend the quote
[3:59:09.520 --> 3:59:11.520]  fallen or sinful state
[3:59:11.520 --> 3:59:13.520]  that we ingest and all the things
[3:59:13.520 --> 3:59:15.520]  that we try to bring into our bodies
[3:59:15.520 --> 3:59:17.520]  to change who we are
[3:59:17.520 --> 3:59:19.520]  are only lowering us
[3:59:19.520 --> 3:59:21.520]  they're only making us more depressed
[3:59:21.520 --> 3:59:23.520]  and in the end they're only making us less filled
[3:59:23.520 --> 3:59:25.520]  it is only by going within
[3:59:25.520 --> 3:59:27.520]  and really making that connection to God
[3:59:27.520 --> 3:59:29.520]  that we can truly empower ourselves
[3:59:29.520 --> 3:59:31.520]  that's why the globe was bombarded
[3:59:31.520 --> 3:59:33.520]  with toxins and chemicals to block us
[3:59:33.520 --> 3:59:35.520]  getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[3:59:35.520 --> 3:59:37.520]  and trace elements our bodies need
[3:59:37.520 --> 3:59:39.520]  healthy and to be able to
[3:59:39.520 --> 3:59:41.520]  be on the third dimension
[3:59:41.520 --> 3:59:43.520]  and that's where the incredible products come in
