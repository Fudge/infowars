[00:00.000 --> 00:20.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday edition, the
[00:20.920 --> 00:22.960]  26th day of January 2021.
[00:22.960 --> 00:27.000]  I'm sure you're going to be taking over very, very soon with huge breaking news, but just
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.440]  upfront, I wanted to just thank all of you for your action and all of you raising the
[00:30.440 --> 00:31.440]  alarm.
[00:31.440 --> 00:36.800]  And I want to thank you all for your prayers for the global awakening because that is happening.
[00:36.800 --> 00:42.360]  The globalists want to be able to kill people and euthanize people and genetically manipulate
[00:42.360 --> 00:46.920]  the population and sterilize the population and have liability protection.
[00:46.920 --> 00:50.360]  That's what this whole globalist takeover and whole globalist pushes about.
[00:50.360 --> 00:53.520]  But the fact that Merck just pulled out of their vaccine program and said, you don't
[00:53.520 --> 00:57.480]  need the vaccine, it'll hurt you, and you need to have your own immunity shows that
[00:57.480 --> 01:03.600]  they understand that this whole test that Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab launched is failing.
[01:03.600 --> 01:08.320]  And there's so much more all cover coming up in this hour with Owen, but they are suspending
[01:08.320 --> 01:11.480]  the Merck research into the vaccines that they've pulled back.
[01:11.480 --> 01:16.320]  They've pulled their two vaccines back with WHO, just said pregnant women shouldn't take
[01:16.320 --> 01:19.440]  the mRNA vaccines.
[01:19.440 --> 01:23.040]  You've got deaths all over the country, all the world now being investigated by the police
[01:23.040 --> 01:24.680]  as being killed by the vaccine.
[01:24.680 --> 01:27.440]  And they're saying, we don't care if you have liability protection.
[01:27.440 --> 01:31.560]  When somebody dies in an hour or two from this, we have to get involved.
[01:31.560 --> 01:34.680]  You see, medicine wants to be God.
[01:34.680 --> 01:35.680]  It's a cult.
[01:35.680 --> 01:37.280]  Remember what the governor of Virginia said a few years ago?
[01:37.280 --> 01:39.520]  He said, oh, the police, of course, don't get involved.
[01:39.520 --> 01:43.080]  It's between the mother and the doctor of the baby live.
[01:43.080 --> 01:46.840]  The eugenicist want control of the life cycle.
[01:46.840 --> 01:50.120]  And so this is all a power grab to set that precedent and it's failing.
[01:50.120 --> 01:53.200]  Dr. Gates said 700,000 will get sick or die.
[01:53.200 --> 01:54.400]  He wants to normalize that.
[01:54.400 --> 01:55.400]  Well, it's not going to work.
[01:55.400 --> 01:58.920]  And it's coming out that the vaccines don't work and they're all a fraud and it's all
[01:58.920 --> 01:59.920]  a power grab.
[01:59.920 --> 02:01.600]  You'll always still wear the mask.
[02:01.600 --> 02:05.240]  And so they are now gauging this and realizing it's backfired.
[02:05.240 --> 02:06.600]  So spread the word to everyone you know.
[02:06.600 --> 02:07.600]  Spread the articles at infowars.com.
[02:07.600 --> 02:09.240]  Owen's going to take over right now.
[02:09.240 --> 02:12.000]  I've got a big special report coming up where I lay all this out.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.080]  There's another big special report on infowars.com and Band-Aught Video that's got to get out.
[02:16.080 --> 02:20.560]  It's very powerful and very important that I did yesterday of the deals with the fact
[02:20.560 --> 02:23.800]  that we are under global martial law and it is UN run.
[02:23.800 --> 02:25.880]  That sounds scary, but it's true.
[02:25.880 --> 02:30.080]  And recognizing that will allow us to reverse it, but only admitting the true level of attack
[02:30.080 --> 02:32.320]  we're under will allow people to get out of this.
[02:32.320 --> 02:35.000]  If you don't tell them the vaccine's designed to sterilize them, they're going to take
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.320]  and get sterilized.
[02:36.320 --> 02:38.800]  It sounds crazy to say that, but it's true.
[02:38.800 --> 02:43.280]  And now they're having to admit that it attacks the baby, it attacks the placenta.
[02:43.280 --> 02:44.280]  It's a kill weapon.
[02:44.280 --> 02:48.800]  That's what the top scientist said when it first was getting developed six months ago.
[02:48.800 --> 02:51.480]  All right, we have a lot of whistleblowers.
[02:51.480 --> 02:53.840]  We have good people at the highest levels coming out as well, and that's what we're
[02:53.840 --> 02:54.840]  going to turn this around on.
[02:54.840 --> 02:56.680]  So that's the kickoff of the show.
[02:56.680 --> 02:59.600]  Please, Paul Revere's realize, every day could be our last day on air.
[02:59.600 --> 03:02.640]  The enemy's moving fast because they know they're losing, so please share this live
[03:02.640 --> 03:05.400]  link or tell folks at local stations you're listening to right now.
[03:05.400 --> 03:06.400]  God bless and good luck.
[03:06.400 --> 03:07.400]  Here's Owen Schruin.
[03:07.400 --> 03:11.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now live inside the infowars world headquarters
[03:11.720 --> 03:13.920]  in Austin, Texas.
[03:13.920 --> 03:16.680]  We've got so much coming up for you today.
[03:16.680 --> 03:21.320]  More from Alex Jones, Robert Barnes coming up in the second hour, and we're going to
[03:21.320 --> 03:27.680]  be breaking what is really an indication of what the Democrats, but more importantly,
[03:27.680 --> 03:32.160]  the globalists have planned for any citizen that still yearns to be free.
[03:32.160 --> 03:34.280]  You want to be a free citizen of America.
[03:34.280 --> 03:37.560]  You want to be a free citizen of the world while you're going to be labeled a domestic
[03:37.560 --> 03:40.000]  terrorist and sent to a gulag.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.640]  That's how they can end freedom is end all the promoters of freedom.
[03:43.640 --> 03:46.080]  And so there's more political news with that.
[03:46.080 --> 03:52.160]  Now anybody, the big donors to Republicans, Democrats saying anybody who doesn't completely
[03:52.160 --> 03:53.640]  disavow Trump will lose their money.
[03:53.640 --> 03:59.720]  But you know, I'm sitting up last night thinking about today's broadcast, thinking about how
[03:59.720 --> 04:03.440]  I can draw it back because we're going to hone in on all of this stuff, the COVID, the political
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.960]  moves, the fake Biden administration, the Trump administration down in Florida now,
[04:07.960 --> 04:09.600]  all of it.
[04:09.600 --> 04:14.560]  But this story kind of highlights where my mind was at last night at infowars.com.
[04:14.560 --> 04:18.720]  And it's yesterday's story, but it's like it took me really 24 hours to fully grasp
[04:18.720 --> 04:20.160]  how I could present it.
[04:20.160 --> 04:23.400]  World now under UN martial law as great reset moves ahead.
[04:23.400 --> 04:26.920]  And so the World Economic Forum happening right now in Davos, Switzerland.
[04:26.920 --> 04:32.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, here is what is undeniable, undoubtable, and it's just fully frontal
[04:32.840 --> 04:35.520]  now with the COVID and everything.
[04:35.520 --> 04:37.880]  We are in a global government.
[04:37.880 --> 04:43.120]  We are in a corporate global government.
[04:43.120 --> 04:46.800]  Just look around, look around the planet.
[04:46.800 --> 04:47.800]  Everyone shut down.
[04:47.800 --> 04:49.480]  Everyone's doing the fake pandemic.
[04:49.480 --> 04:53.720]  Everyone is either trying to attack Trump and nationalists or having people stand up
[04:53.720 --> 04:54.720]  with them.
[04:54.720 --> 05:00.520]  This is the war for the world to be free once again.
[05:00.520 --> 05:05.760]  Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a best seller overnight because activated charcoal
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.320]  is already one of the top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there.
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.640]  The problem is a lot of the other over the counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring
[05:13.640 --> 05:14.880]  very, very toxic.
[05:14.880 --> 05:16.560]  And also they have fluoride in it.
[05:16.560 --> 05:17.560]  This does not have the fluoride.
[05:17.560 --> 05:19.200]  It doesn't have the additives.
[05:19.200 --> 05:21.840]  This is a concentrated really is high quality.
[05:21.840 --> 05:25.960]  It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial
[05:25.960 --> 05:27.040]  law garbage.
[05:27.040 --> 05:33.200]  But now it's back in stock info wars, Dr. Jones naturals activated charcoal toothpaste.
[05:33.200 --> 05:39.000]  Now back in stock at info wars store.com or call toll free triple eight two five three
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  three one three nine.
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.160]  It also makes a great gift for your family, for your grandkids, for your mother, your
[05:44.160 --> 05:48.640]  father, for everybody and it supports the info war activated charcoal from Dr. Jones
[05:48.640 --> 05:53.840]  naturals available again at info wars store.com and a lot of other products that have been
[05:53.840 --> 05:57.480]  sold out have just now come back in as well like pollen block.
[05:57.480 --> 06:03.960]  So check that out when you're in the store.
[06:03.960 --> 06:07.880]  It's Tuesday, January 26 the year is 2021.
[06:07.880 --> 06:14.880]  I'm your host Alex Jones with massively positive breaking news that does have a very, very
[06:14.880 --> 06:16.680]  sickening sidebar to it.
[06:16.680 --> 06:23.360]  But overall, it shows that humanity is waking up and there's major pushback even inside
[06:23.360 --> 06:24.720]  global institutions.
[06:24.720 --> 06:26.640]  So get ready for this.
[06:26.640 --> 06:34.600]  Let me just read you these headlines, WHO warns against pregnant women taking the mRNA
[06:34.600 --> 06:40.920]  vaccines, Merck scraps its COVID vaccine program all together.
[06:40.920 --> 06:43.200]  Wait till you hear why they did that.
[06:43.200 --> 06:50.760]  Also death of Northern California man who was 50 years old hours after he took the mRNA
[06:50.760 --> 06:53.280]  vaccine is under criminal investigation.
[06:53.280 --> 06:59.720]  We're also trying to spin why Hank Aaron died after taking the vaccine and so much more.
[06:59.720 --> 07:04.480]  Meanwhile, over in the UK, they are arresting and finding people that are caught outside
[07:04.480 --> 07:07.280]  playing in the snow.
[07:07.280 --> 07:13.080]  This is all part of the great globalist planetary reset and conditioning us to accept permanent
[07:13.080 --> 07:15.240]  medical martial law.
[07:15.240 --> 07:21.000]  Info wars has been proven right again, right on target, not because we're psychic and just
[07:21.000 --> 07:28.360]  magically imagined this, no, but because we studied what mRNA vaccines really are and
[07:28.360 --> 07:33.560]  looked at what top scientists like Wolfgang Wudard, who heads up an EU medical advisory
[07:33.560 --> 07:39.320]  board at the very highest levels and the former chief science officer at a major company
[07:39.320 --> 07:46.720]  also went public the same time in a white paper warning the world that the particular
[07:46.720 --> 07:54.240]  Pfizer immun RNA vaccine would actually attack the placenta and probably the fetus.
[07:54.240 --> 08:00.920]  Well now, what's being reported all over the world, WHO warns pregnant women should not
[08:00.920 --> 08:07.920]  take Moderna COVID-19 vaccine because it causes violent miscarriages.
[08:07.920 --> 08:15.440]  Repeat, it is not a vaccine, it is a gene therapy that programs your body to attack
[08:15.440 --> 08:20.360]  certain proteins associated with the common cold virus.
[08:20.360 --> 08:24.640]  They also predicted it would cause massive autoimmune responses in men and women and
[08:24.640 --> 08:27.600]  also turn off some people's immune systems.
[08:27.600 --> 08:32.600]  They also predicted that it would kill many people shortly after they took it.
[08:32.600 --> 08:34.760]  And now we know that's the case.
[08:34.760 --> 08:39.880]  It doesn't matter if it's Moderna, it doesn't matter if it's Pfizer, it doesn't matter
[08:39.880 --> 08:44.680]  if it's mRNA, it's basically doing the same thing and it's causing all sorts of incredible
[08:44.680 --> 08:45.680]  problems.
[08:45.680 --> 08:46.680]  Here's the bigger question.
[08:46.680 --> 08:47.680]  What are they thinking?
[08:47.680 --> 08:53.960]  Well, I told you, they want to set the precedent to make us sick, to maim us and then just
[08:53.960 --> 08:56.440]  have the public accept it, just like with autism.
[08:56.440 --> 09:00.920]  They know full well what they're doing with autism, tens of millions of autistic children
[09:00.920 --> 09:05.800]  in the U.S. alone, hundreds of millions worldwide, only industrialized countries have it.
[09:05.800 --> 09:09.000]  The Amish don't have it here in the United States because they're not being vaccinated
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.720]  and it's causing an autoimmune response in the stomach and in the brain.
[09:12.720 --> 09:17.840]  This was well known decades ago, but they just cover it up and it's now accepted.
[09:17.840 --> 09:18.920]  That's not just my opinion.
[09:18.920 --> 09:26.560]  We have last December of 2019, so about 13 months ago, the U.N. coming out and admitting
[09:26.560 --> 09:30.480]  that vaccines aren't testing or causing massive problems and that frontline health workers
[09:30.480 --> 09:32.160]  are quote wobbly.
[09:32.160 --> 09:35.120]  So this is the WHO covering its butt.
[09:35.120 --> 09:37.880]  They know this is going to cause massive miscarriages, it already is.
[09:37.880 --> 09:40.280]  They know it's going to cause all sorts of other problems.
[09:40.280 --> 09:43.480]  So just like the British Ministry of Defense, a month and a half ago, inoculations started
[09:43.480 --> 09:49.720]  there first, said a week into it, okay pregnant women don't take it, above 75 don't take
[09:49.720 --> 09:55.040]  it, under 16 don't take it, but you see that's only advisory information.
[09:55.040 --> 09:58.240]  The doctors and the health systems are corporately controlled.
[09:58.240 --> 10:01.640]  They're still rolling forward with it and not telling the public.
[10:01.640 --> 10:03.600]  So this is basically fine print.
[10:03.600 --> 10:07.240]  They put these stories out so they can say they warned you, but then when you actually
[10:07.240 --> 10:13.080]  go to the hospital or go to the clinic, they do not tell you, they give you a vaccine form
[10:13.080 --> 10:17.840]  that tells you commonly asked questions that you might get a sore arm or this or that,
[10:17.840 --> 10:19.240]  but that it's safe and effective.
[10:19.240 --> 10:22.080]  And that's how this horrible deception works.
[10:22.080 --> 10:23.080]  So again, there's that headline.
[10:23.080 --> 10:24.080]  It's on infowars.com.
[10:24.080 --> 10:26.320]  I suggest you spread it.
[10:26.320 --> 10:32.320]  WHO warns pregnant women not to take Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.
[10:32.320 --> 10:35.760]  Let's move to the next huge story.
[10:35.760 --> 10:43.720]  Mark scraps COVID vaccine program entirely and two vaccines it was developing saying
[10:43.720 --> 10:50.560]  it's more effective to get the virus and recover because this is such a large class of viruses.
[10:50.560 --> 10:54.920]  You cannot create a vaccine that actually works because it's all based on the cold virus,
[10:54.920 --> 10:57.560]  which they've tried thousands of times to create a cure for.
[10:57.560 --> 11:02.480]  All you can do is create an autoimmune response in people who've had the vaccine the next
[11:02.480 --> 11:05.840]  time they run into a regular cold virus that can kill them.
[11:05.840 --> 11:11.520]  Just like you saw with the Spanish flu in 1917, 1918, they killed 50 million people.
[11:11.520 --> 11:13.520]  It wasn't the flu that killed them.
[11:13.520 --> 11:16.840]  It was the autoimmune response in the lungs.
[11:16.840 --> 11:17.840]  Well here it is.
[11:17.840 --> 11:23.920]  Mark scraps COVID vaccines that it's more effective to get the virus and recover.
[11:23.920 --> 11:25.400]  But they knew all this.
[11:25.400 --> 11:32.960]  With Alex Jones and Mike Adams and all of our guests could tell you this 11 months ago
[11:32.960 --> 11:35.880]  when the development started, don't you think Bill Gates and all of them know this?
[11:35.880 --> 11:39.040]  They know full well what they're doing.
[11:39.040 --> 11:44.280]  So Merck knows this is too big and this is failing and this just symbolizes that they
[11:44.280 --> 11:48.720]  want to pull out of this and don't want to be like Moderna and Pfizer and others.
[11:48.720 --> 11:53.840]  Oh, and don't forget Australia caught out with their vaccine, remember that a few months
[11:53.840 --> 12:01.280]  ago when quietly had to pull tens of millions of dosages because it was giving people a
[12:01.280 --> 12:07.920]  positive HIV test, which I predicted again 10 months ago and how did I do that?
[12:07.920 --> 12:13.840]  It's a common cold virus with HIV delivery system welded onto it and that's according
[12:13.840 --> 12:16.320]  to more than 20 top universities.
[12:16.320 --> 12:23.520]  But oh, Snopes says it's a wise tale even though you can look it up right now.
[12:23.520 --> 12:29.520]  It's like they say it's made up that Fauci funded illegal testing at the Wuhan lab starting
[12:29.520 --> 12:34.680]  in 2015, even though it's in all the major publications, but Snopes is God.
[12:34.680 --> 12:37.320]  They also say Hank Aaron didn't die from the vaccine.
[12:37.320 --> 12:38.600]  They just don't know why he died.
[12:38.600 --> 12:40.880]  He just died after he took the second one.
[12:40.880 --> 12:47.320]  Okay, let's move on to this next one, death of Northern California man 52 hours after
[12:47.320 --> 12:48.320]  he took it.
[12:48.320 --> 12:52.680]  He first began to be paralyzed and he had convulsions and then he died.
[12:52.680 --> 12:56.040]  The police began to investigate it, but then they had the media come down on them in big
[12:56.040 --> 12:59.080]  tech when they said, you're not allowed to do that.
[12:59.080 --> 13:01.360]  Only the UN can say how somebody died.
[13:01.360 --> 13:03.680]  Wow, the UN is God.
[13:03.680 --> 13:04.680]  So there you go.
[13:04.680 --> 13:08.280]  And don't worry Snopes is already on it saying there's nothing to look at, nothing happening
[13:08.280 --> 13:10.240]  seriously just within hours of him being dead.
[13:10.240 --> 13:14.560]  Just Snopes said Snopes is the coroner, Snopes is God.
[13:14.560 --> 13:20.840]  And since I mentioned that here's another one, oh, Hank Aaron, Hank Aaron died of natural
[13:20.840 --> 13:23.920]  causes had no COVID-19 symptoms.
[13:23.920 --> 13:27.200]  Medical examiner says, you know, it's just, he's 80 something years old.
[13:27.200 --> 13:29.480]  He just took it and then he just stopped breathing.
[13:29.480 --> 13:31.760]  You know, he just found dead at his house.
[13:31.760 --> 13:33.320]  No big deal.
[13:33.320 --> 13:34.320]  No big deal.
[13:34.320 --> 13:38.560]  All people get their faces paralyzed, getting narcolepsy and getting epilepsy and all the
[13:38.560 --> 13:43.640]  girls that died, got cancer after they took the Gardasil shot, which of course the texture
[13:43.640 --> 13:44.640]  ovaries.
[13:44.640 --> 13:45.640]  Everything's fine.
[13:45.640 --> 13:46.640]  Just getting used to it.
[13:46.640 --> 13:47.640]  Yeah.
[13:47.640 --> 13:48.640]  A lot of old people are dying.
[13:48.640 --> 13:54.400]  Here and there, 20 here, 40 there, 50 there from the COVID shot, but the Swedish government
[13:54.400 --> 13:56.640]  and other governments say that's an okay price to pay.
[13:56.640 --> 13:59.960]  It's an okay price to pay.
[13:59.960 --> 14:04.200]  The big takeaway here is the wheels have come off this whole thing.
[14:04.200 --> 14:10.440]  And the fact that a major vaccine maker that already put out the Gardasil shot before and
[14:10.440 --> 14:15.600]  got caught doing that, despite the fact they've been given liability protection, the fact
[14:15.600 --> 14:19.640]  that Merck has scrapped its program and pulled out.
[14:19.640 --> 14:26.720]  They know this big, giant, globalist takeover, this gang raping of the public is failing.
[14:26.720 --> 14:30.880]  And they know no matter how much you in immunity, how much U.S. immunity they get, that people
[14:30.880 --> 14:33.600]  are pissed and they're aware of what's happening.
[14:33.600 --> 14:38.240]  When Bill Gates six months ago said, hey, 700,000 or you get sick and die.
[14:38.240 --> 14:41.280]  And now the public's learning that it doesn't even protect you and you still have to wear
[14:41.280 --> 14:45.680]  a mask and you can still get COVID or any other virus that it's all a fraud.
[14:45.680 --> 14:47.320]  This is so gigantic.
[14:47.320 --> 14:49.160]  And so past vaccines were bad.
[14:49.160 --> 14:50.160]  They were tainted.
[14:50.160 --> 14:51.160]  They had their problems.
[14:51.160 --> 14:52.960]  They had Trojan horses in many cases.
[14:52.960 --> 14:58.000]  But now they are pushing genetic engineering and manipulation of our DNA.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.800]  And again, just trying to set the precedent to get away with this in plain view, but the
[15:02.800 --> 15:05.120]  public is waking up.
[15:05.120 --> 15:09.160]  So that's why we can't just become punch-drunk to people dying and getting sick from these
[15:09.160 --> 15:10.160]  vaccines.
[15:10.160 --> 15:11.160]  We have to take a week out.
[15:11.160 --> 15:12.160]  We have to talk about it.
[15:12.160 --> 15:17.000]  We have to open the phones up on my show so nurses and doctors can call in and be heard.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.840]  Because all I'm getting on the ground from nurses and doctors and people that work in
[15:19.840 --> 15:23.600]  nursing homes is they'll shoot up the whole nursing home and two or three will die and
[15:23.600 --> 15:26.000]  the rest can't even get a bed for a week.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.440]  And then they're scared to give them the next round of shots because that's when the real
[15:28.440 --> 15:29.800]  autoimmune response happens.
[15:29.800 --> 15:34.560]  So folks, they haven't even vaccinated 2% of the population yet and it's already a
[15:34.560 --> 15:35.560]  firestorm.
[15:35.560 --> 15:40.080]  So can you imagine when they try to vaccinate 80% and try to force people to get on playing
[15:40.080 --> 15:41.280]  games to have this?
[15:41.280 --> 15:42.280]  This is a genocide.
[15:42.280 --> 15:43.280]  This is a criminal takeover.
[15:43.280 --> 15:44.280]  All right.
[15:44.280 --> 15:46.000]  Back to Owen Schroer in the live broadcast.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.720]  More special reports coming up.
[15:47.720 --> 15:48.720]  God bless.
[15:48.720 --> 15:51.720]  And I just hope you'll share this with everybody you know because this is life-saving information.
[15:51.720 --> 15:56.640]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[15:56.640 --> 15:57.640]  Me too.
[15:57.640 --> 16:01.800]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[16:01.800 --> 16:04.560]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.920]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[16:08.920 --> 16:10.680]  You probably already believe that.
[16:10.680 --> 16:11.840]  I certainly do.
[16:11.840 --> 16:12.840]  So here's the thing.
[16:12.840 --> 16:17.240]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[16:17.240 --> 16:21.360]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[16:21.360 --> 16:27.080]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.
[16:27.080 --> 16:28.640]  No cures or treatments there.

[16:52.280 --> 16:57.360]  Attention radio listeners, if you're concerned about the coming chaos after the November
[16:57.360 --> 17:00.720]  elections, this will be an extremely important message.
[17:00.720 --> 17:01.720]  Here's why.
[17:01.720 --> 17:07.200]  No matter what the outcome in November, catastrophic social upheaval is a very real
[17:07.200 --> 17:08.480]  possibility.
[17:08.480 --> 17:09.800]  Here's why this is important.
[17:09.800 --> 17:14.600]  Listen, we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain
[17:14.600 --> 17:18.440]  waves of social chaos and unstable currencies.
[17:18.440 --> 17:23.120]  But did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship
[17:23.120 --> 17:27.560]  when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold?
[17:27.560 --> 17:28.560]  It's true.
[17:28.560 --> 17:33.240]  Open pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value in
[17:33.240 --> 17:34.960]  the coming hard times ahead.
[17:34.960 --> 17:39.160]  Go to survivalseedbank.com to get heirloom seeds below wholesale.

[17:48.760 --> 17:52.640]  Beat the crowds by claiming your own survival seed bank today.
[17:52.640 --> 18:00.440]  The post-industrial world, that's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed onto at the Rio
[18:00.440 --> 18:05.480]  de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[18:05.480 --> 18:10.600]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world, plows swat with
[18:10.600 --> 18:15.000]  the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.120]  great reset is Agenda 2030.
[18:17.120 --> 18:21.720]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[18:21.720 --> 18:24.760]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[18:24.760 --> 18:31.000]  It is making the population war by design so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy
[18:31.000 --> 18:32.760]  over you and your family.
[18:32.760 --> 18:38.400]  They're destroying civilization, rebuilding in their dystopic image.
[18:38.400 --> 18:42.320]  We are fighting this at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[18:42.320 --> 18:47.120]  We are fighting for a pro-human future and we need you to get the facts, to research
[18:47.120 --> 18:49.400]  and share with others and join the fight.

[19:24.960 --> 19:28.640]  at a very good price and you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit
[19:28.640 --> 19:31.440]  in this goes to us to fund our operation.
[19:31.440 --> 19:36.880]  So, prepare with Alex.com or infowarsstore.com, you can find the preparedness section there,
[19:36.880 --> 19:39.040]  water filtration, air filtration, it's all there.
[19:39.040 --> 19:42.040]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more.
[19:42.040 --> 19:43.280]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[19:43.280 --> 19:44.280]  It starts with self-defense.
[19:44.280 --> 19:45.760]  It starts with being prepared.
[19:45.760 --> 19:46.920]  It starts with horrible food.
[19:46.920 --> 19:49.720]  It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight.
[19:49.720 --> 19:57.200]  You'll win in the end.
[19:57.200 --> 20:12.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:12.720 --> 20:15.920]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[20:15.920 --> 20:20.920]  Here's the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[20:20.920 --> 20:28.960]  And we're back live inside the info wars world headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[20:28.960 --> 20:29.960]  Very significant.
[20:29.960 --> 20:36.520]  We're in Texas, one of the I'd say top five states to be right now because we're open
[20:36.520 --> 20:37.520]  for business.
[20:37.520 --> 20:39.520]  It's kind of a rare thing in America these days.
[20:39.520 --> 20:42.440]  I'm going to have more on that coming up.
[20:42.440 --> 20:45.960]  So much news to get here, guys, if you want to do a document cam of all the news.
[20:45.960 --> 20:53.640]  We have political developments with Democrats proposing legislation, including some such
[20:53.640 --> 20:57.520]  legislation that would label you a listener, a domestic terrorist.
[20:57.520 --> 20:58.520]  Why?
[20:58.520 --> 21:01.000]  Well, not because you've committed any violent crime, but because you support Trump, love
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.240]  America and are a free thinker.
[21:05.240 --> 21:11.440]  The most demonized and attacked individuals in the world today are free thinkers.
[21:11.440 --> 21:14.440]  I don't want to hear about discrimination because of color of your skin.
[21:14.440 --> 21:18.640]  I don't want to hear about discrimination because of any of all this garbage that gets
[21:18.640 --> 21:19.640]  brought up.
[21:19.640 --> 21:22.280]  No, it's free thinkers.
[21:22.280 --> 21:28.280]  Free thinkers are the most discriminated against people in the world today.
[21:28.280 --> 21:36.200]  And so last night I had a long broadcast day yesterday and I just kind of, it just felt
[21:36.200 --> 21:42.400]  like, you know, like, wasn't your best performance and so I'm just thinking last night, what
[21:42.400 --> 21:49.200]  can I draw back to show the bigger picture so that we're not getting distracted by the
[21:49.200 --> 21:55.440]  trees, but instead seeing the whole forest?
[21:55.440 --> 22:04.400]  And I thought, and it came to me just through osmosis last night, I just wanted to kind
[22:04.400 --> 22:06.520]  of forget about everything first because that's what I kind of have to do.
[22:06.520 --> 22:12.720]  So I went and I was watching just old concert footage, Metallica in the 80s, ACDC 10 years
[22:12.720 --> 22:21.120]  ago, just old concert footage from all over the world, Sweden, Europe, Brazil, Argentina.
[22:21.120 --> 22:29.560]  And I'm just sitting, I'm thinking, watching 150,000 people rock to ACDC in River Plate
[22:29.560 --> 22:36.920]  and I'm just thinking, man, the real fun earth used to be, the real fun it used to be.
[22:36.920 --> 22:42.120]  You go to a ball game, a college ball game, you listen to the band, eat popcorn, the kids,
[22:42.120 --> 22:43.120]  everything.
[22:43.120 --> 22:48.000]  You go to a ball game, baseball team, the crack of the bat, the smack of the glove, a
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.760]  cold beer to your lips.
[22:50.760 --> 22:54.880]  You go to a concert, you're surrounded by a bunch of people, everybody there for the
[22:54.880 --> 23:01.360]  same reason, the energy, the vibes, the rock, the roll, it's all done, all canceled.
[23:01.360 --> 23:04.880]  You don't get to experience that anymore.
[23:04.880 --> 23:10.280]  And that's just some of the more frivolous entertainment.
[23:10.280 --> 23:14.600]  And I was actually, I met a guy from New York last night who came, he literally just came
[23:14.600 --> 23:15.600]  to Austin with a hotel.
[23:15.600 --> 23:16.600]  He's like, I can't live in New York.
[23:16.600 --> 23:17.720]  He's like, literally everything's closed.
[23:17.720 --> 23:18.720]  I can't go to dinner.
[23:18.720 --> 23:19.720]  I can't work out.
[23:19.720 --> 23:20.720]  Look at me, I'm fat.
[23:20.720 --> 23:21.720]  He was just stunned.
[23:21.720 --> 23:22.720]  He was like, wow, you guys get to work out here.
[23:22.720 --> 23:23.720]  You have a gym open.
[23:23.720 --> 23:24.720]  Incredible.
[23:24.720 --> 23:25.720]  We'll talk about that later.
[23:25.720 --> 23:33.000]  But so my point is that remember how fun planet earth used to be, remember how fun freedom
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  used to be.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.520]  I don't think anybody would deny this.
[23:36.520 --> 23:45.200]  This is beyond political lines.
[23:45.200 --> 23:49.200]  And you're just, you're just like, what happened?
[23:49.200 --> 23:51.640]  What happened?
[23:51.640 --> 23:56.840]  Well, the brainwash mind would go to, oh, well, there was a deadly pandemic COVID.
[23:56.840 --> 23:59.760]  Well, you, the audience know that that's not the case.
[23:59.760 --> 24:01.840]  There was no deadly pandemic.
[24:01.840 --> 24:04.880]  I haven't looked at the death count numbers for the whole world.
[24:04.880 --> 24:07.280]  Maybe we should do an exclusive report on that.
[24:07.280 --> 24:08.360]  I haven't seen anybody else do it.
[24:08.360 --> 24:13.560]  But we extensively looked at the death count in the United States and it's totally proven
[24:13.560 --> 24:14.720]  there is no pandemic.
[24:14.720 --> 24:17.680]  I don't want to go into the details now.
[24:17.680 --> 24:18.680]  We've already done it.
[24:18.680 --> 24:24.160]  There was no deadly pandemic in the United States in the year 2020.
[24:24.160 --> 24:27.760]  And now you have other publications like the Wall Street Journal and other ones admitting,
[24:27.760 --> 24:30.560]  okay, there was no pandemic, but they don't say it in so many words.
[24:30.560 --> 24:32.520]  They just say, what happened to the flu?
[24:32.520 --> 24:33.520]  What happened to pneumonia?
[24:33.520 --> 24:36.000]  There's zero flu deaths, zero pneumonia deaths.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.680]  Well, it's all COVID now.
[24:38.680 --> 24:41.720]  And so there's a bunch of complications about all of this.
[24:41.720 --> 24:44.840]  Now they're admitting it came out of a Wuhan lab.
[24:44.840 --> 24:45.920]  It's totally undeniable.
[24:45.920 --> 24:48.920]  But then China points to the U.S. and says, no, it came out of your lab.
[24:48.920 --> 24:54.280]  Well, no, it was transferred to your lab from the North Carolina lab under the Obama administration.
[24:54.280 --> 24:55.680]  Fauci and Gates were spearheading that.
[24:55.680 --> 25:01.280]  But again, I'm focusing on the tree.
[25:01.280 --> 25:03.640]  Planet Earth used to be one hell of a time, didn't it?
[25:03.640 --> 25:07.280]  Boy, we knew how to have a good time.
[25:07.280 --> 25:08.920]  Was it a little degenerative?
[25:08.920 --> 25:12.480]  Did it maybe cost us because we got distracted with it?
[25:12.480 --> 25:13.480]  Yeah, I think so.
[25:13.480 --> 25:17.240]  Here's what is undeniable.
[25:17.240 --> 25:23.280]  Here's what hit me like a ton of bricks as I'm just going through the Internet watching
[25:23.280 --> 25:29.040]  old concert footage, just missing the old days, as they say, not to be cliche, but the
[25:29.040 --> 25:30.720]  days before we had the fake pandemic.
[25:30.720 --> 25:32.880]  But it's not even that.
[25:32.880 --> 25:34.880]  It's total proof.
[25:34.880 --> 25:37.240]  It's total unequivocal proof.
[25:37.240 --> 25:38.720]  It cannot be denied.
[25:38.720 --> 25:40.000]  It shall not be denied.
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.840]  And it's time to accept it, face it, and have a discussion about it.
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.880]  Problem is, no one else will do it except Implewars and maybe a few people out there,
[25:47.880 --> 25:51.400]  but very few and far between.
[25:51.400 --> 25:53.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are in.
[25:53.240 --> 25:55.640]  And I know you know this, but it's just not stated.
[25:55.640 --> 25:58.360]  It doesn't hit home.
[25:58.360 --> 26:03.160]  We are in a corporate world government.
[26:03.160 --> 26:05.520]  Do you understand?
[26:05.520 --> 26:07.600]  There is a corporate world government.
[26:07.600 --> 26:10.600]  They run the planet.
[26:10.600 --> 26:11.720]  Look at COVID.
[26:11.720 --> 26:13.160]  Look at the fake pandemic.
[26:13.160 --> 26:17.640]  Look around you.
[26:17.640 --> 26:19.600]  Know where to go.
[26:19.600 --> 26:22.000]  Know where to escape to.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.360]  No country that's not faking a pandemic.
[26:24.360 --> 26:26.320]  No country that's open for business.
[26:26.320 --> 26:28.000]  You can't go watch a ball game.
[26:28.000 --> 26:29.360]  You can't go to a concert.
[26:29.360 --> 26:31.680]  It's all shut down for COVID.
[26:31.680 --> 26:32.680]  No.
[26:32.680 --> 26:39.240]  It's all shut down because the corporate world government is in control of every country.
[26:39.240 --> 26:42.440]  And they're going for the great reset right now.
[26:42.440 --> 26:47.920]  And that's why it's the number one discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
[26:47.920 --> 26:50.040]  The good news is the world's waking up to it.
[26:50.040 --> 27:00.400]  And just like Biden videos on YouTube, we're getting 10 to 1 in some instances 15 to 1 dislikes
[27:00.400 --> 27:01.840]  to likes.
[27:01.840 --> 27:05.440]  So YouTube just removed them and then canceled them and then said no comments because all
[27:05.440 --> 27:08.120]  the comments were Joe Biden's pedophile, Joe Biden lost the election.
[27:08.120 --> 27:09.120]  He cheated.
[27:09.120 --> 27:11.320]  So they just deleted the comments, deleted the dislikes.
[27:11.320 --> 27:18.440]  But now that same phenomenon is happening on the World Economic Forum YouTube page where
[27:18.440 --> 27:24.400]  they posted their opening video from the World Economic Forum in Davos this year titled,
[27:24.400 --> 27:27.400]  What is the Great Reset, Davos Agenda for 2021?
[27:27.400 --> 27:33.480]  Now remember the New York Times and CNN and the Washington Post and the rest said it's
[27:33.480 --> 27:35.160]  a conspiracy theory.
[27:35.160 --> 27:37.880]  There is no great reset.
[27:37.880 --> 27:41.240]  As the World Economic Forum with Klaus Schwab and others are saying, great reset, great
[27:41.240 --> 27:43.000]  reset, great reset, great reset.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.720]  They tell you, hey, we're having a great reset.
[27:44.720 --> 27:46.640]  The corporate world government is having a great reset.
[27:46.640 --> 27:49.240]  That's why we're shutting everything down in the name of a pandemic.
[27:49.240 --> 27:51.040]  That's just fake news to get the great reset.
[27:51.040 --> 27:58.480]  And then you say, hey, why is this World Economic Forum talking about a great reset?
[27:58.480 --> 28:00.640]  And they say, oh, that doesn't exist.
[28:00.640 --> 28:01.800]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[28:01.800 --> 28:04.440]  Well, it's right out of their mouth.
[28:04.440 --> 28:09.800]  But the dislikes to likes on the great reset, I'm not good at math.
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.640]  What is this guys, 15, 20 to one?
[28:13.640 --> 28:16.720]  And then again, all the comments, this is the new world order.
[28:16.720 --> 28:17.720]  This is globalism.
[28:17.720 --> 28:18.720]  This is a world government.
[28:18.720 --> 28:20.640]  We do not consent.
[28:20.640 --> 28:25.200]  When did you ever consent to be in a world government?
[28:25.200 --> 28:33.760]  When did you ever consent to being part of a corporate technocracy bent on world domination?
[28:33.760 --> 28:39.360]  Well, sadly, we all consented by not fighting it harder and by not paying attention because
[28:39.360 --> 28:40.960]  we were so fat and happy.
[28:40.960 --> 28:43.000]  But folks, it's here.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.480]  We're in a corporate world government.
[28:45.480 --> 28:46.480]  Maybe you like it.
[28:46.480 --> 28:47.480]  Maybe you don't.
[28:47.480 --> 28:52.760]  It's time to start having a serious discussion about it and not pretending it doesn't exist.
[28:52.760 --> 28:58.880]  Anybody listening to my voice and simply searching in the term, Davos Group, technocracy, we're
[28:58.880 --> 29:05.360]  technocrats, you will get Klaus Schwab and Sean Claude Yunker and all the new world order
[29:05.360 --> 29:11.280]  globalists like Gigi Pink saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments,
[29:11.280 --> 29:14.280]  that they want businessmen, technocrats over it.
[29:14.280 --> 29:15.760]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[29:15.760 --> 29:20.240]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to
[29:20.240 --> 29:21.240]  bankrupt you and make you poor.
[29:21.240 --> 29:26.280]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is, but you see, he believes because he's
[29:26.280 --> 29:30.040]  hidden it playing you and you're not speaking out against it that he has the right to do
[29:30.040 --> 29:31.040]  it to you.
[29:31.040 --> 29:32.040]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[29:32.040 --> 29:34.040]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[29:34.040 --> 29:38.040]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[29:38.040 --> 29:42.040]  That means worldwide neo-futilism in his own words.
[29:42.040 --> 29:46.240]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccine to sterilize you before
[29:46.240 --> 29:47.440]  you take those shots.
[29:47.440 --> 30:16.120]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, all right?
[30:16.120 --> 30:23.680]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it, but Storovs and Bill Gates
[30:23.680 --> 30:32.560]  and the globalists are on our tail, but the new website is theresistance.video, theresistance.video.
[30:32.560 --> 30:36.960]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[30:36.960 --> 30:42.200]  So the new URL that links right to ban.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[30:42.200 --> 30:47.480]  and all of the special reports and all of the suppressed information is at theresistance.video.
[30:47.480 --> 30:48.480]  Share the link.
[30:48.480 --> 30:49.480]  Theresistance.video.
[30:49.480 --> 30:52.480]  Theresistance.video.

[32:01.480 --> 32:12.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[32:12.640 --> 32:14.360]  Owen Schreuer sitting in for Alex today.
[32:14.360 --> 32:16.600]  We'll be hearing from Alex again.
[32:16.600 --> 32:23.320]  Robert Barnes coming up in the next hour, about 30 minutes from now, to discuss the
[32:23.320 --> 32:29.120]  proposed legislation by the Democrats to label all of their political opposition domestic
[32:29.120 --> 32:30.120]  terrorists.
[32:30.120 --> 32:39.200]  One of the most dangerous power grabs you're ever going to see or hear about, and political
[32:39.200 --> 32:47.480]  persecution, I mean, this is just unheard of, unspeakable stuff, and it just shows you the
[32:47.480 --> 32:53.720]  evil nature of our politicians, but really how afraid they are of you.
[32:53.720 --> 32:55.480]  Now, why would that be?
[32:55.480 --> 32:56.480]  You're a good person.
[32:56.480 --> 32:58.120]  You're a law-abiding citizen.
[32:58.120 --> 32:59.680]  You're a God-fearing American patriot.
[32:59.680 --> 33:00.680]  Why are they afraid of you?
[33:00.680 --> 33:04.000]  Well, that's exactly why.
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.160]  Because you're informed, you're awake, you know what they're up to, and the crimes of
[33:08.160 --> 33:12.240]  the DC establishment have never been more obvious.
[33:12.240 --> 33:14.160]  So that's all coming up and more.
[33:14.160 --> 33:18.440]  You know, we have big deals happening at infowarstor.com right now, and there's five days
[33:18.440 --> 33:24.160]  left on the globalist storm is here special with pollen block 25% off, alpha power 50%
[33:24.160 --> 33:29.200]  off, pure turmeric extract 25% off, all three of those things are selling out fast, plus
[33:29.200 --> 33:30.200]  other deals.
[33:30.200 --> 33:31.200]  But you know what?
[33:31.200 --> 33:36.600]  I got to tell you, the easiest thing for me to do to just talk about all the products
[33:36.600 --> 33:42.360]  that I use at infowarstor.com, all the supplements, which is most of them, but, man, I got to
[33:42.360 --> 33:51.280]  tell you, I hadn't really slept since last Friday, and I use the sleep support supplements
[33:51.280 --> 33:55.720]  at infowarstor.com, knockout, and rocket rest, but I don't like to take it every night
[33:55.720 --> 34:01.800]  because I don't want to make my body acclimated to that, so I can still produce my own melatonin.
[34:01.800 --> 34:06.880]  So I took a few days off, but I couldn't sleep, and so I was desperate last night, so I took
[34:06.880 --> 34:20.160]  rocket rest probably at about 1230, and I was out like a light and had deep, deep sleep
[34:20.160 --> 34:27.600]  until I woke up at 8am this morning, and so, I mean, I'm telling you, the best sleep support,
[34:27.600 --> 34:34.760]  I've tried everything, folks, I've had trouble sleeping forever, I've bounced with insomnia.
[34:34.760 --> 34:41.160]  Thank God, honestly, for me, thank God for rocket rest at infowarstor.com because there
[34:41.160 --> 34:45.440]  would be many sleepless nights if it wasn't for rocket rest, so I'm telling you, knockout
[34:45.440 --> 34:49.920]  is great too, I do take the knockout, but the rocket rest hits me harder, so if you're
[34:49.920 --> 34:53.520]  somebody that doesn't really struggle as much with sleep, but you know, just want something
[34:53.520 --> 34:59.560]  to kind of put you over the edge and put you into, ease you into a nice sleep, knockout
[34:59.560 --> 35:03.280]  at infowarstor.com, I would suggest, but if you're somebody that struggles and you're
[35:03.280 --> 35:09.120]  restless and you just can't get a good night's sleep or stay asleep, rocket rest, deep sleep
[35:09.120 --> 35:16.160]  support exclusively available at infowarstor.com is for you, now, I will warn you, I will warn
[35:16.160 --> 35:20.560]  you, and this is the main difference between rocket rest and knockout, yeah, that's pretty
[35:20.560 --> 35:29.880]  much rocket rest right there, good night, yeah, good night, I will warn you, it's a
[35:29.880 --> 35:36.720]  bit of a hazy morning after rocket rest, I mean, you go into a deep, deep sleep, so
[35:36.720 --> 35:45.320]  I mean, I really couldn't even get the morning fog off until about 9am, and I took more than
[35:45.320 --> 35:50.600]  the recommended dose, I'll tell you that too, so that probably doesn't help, but I was
[35:50.600 --> 35:56.480]  desperate to get some sleep, rocket rest came through again last night, so again, though,
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.320]  fair warning, there will be groggyness after rocket rest, don't really get the groggyness
[36:00.320 --> 36:03.720]  after knockout, like I said, it's not as intense of a formula, it just kind of eases
[36:03.720 --> 36:08.840]  you into sleep, you're good to go, rocket rest, you're guaranteed, deep sleep, not waking
[36:08.840 --> 36:13.800]  up, but there will be a bit of a morning grog, so that's just a fair warning, but I gotta
[36:13.800 --> 36:20.880]  just say, it's easy for me, especially on the outset, to talk about the supplements
[36:20.880 --> 36:28.720]  that I use, and so I am just big on rocket rest today, it's so refreshing, because people
[36:28.720 --> 36:34.760]  know when you have trouble sleeping, sometimes there's an unease trying to go to bed at night,
[36:34.760 --> 36:40.880]  but rocket rest, man, really works for me, so I can't say enough about rocket rest and
[36:40.880 --> 36:44.800]  what it's done for me, but that's just one of the great supplements at infowarstore.com.
[36:44.800 --> 36:52.120]  All right, I've got a bunch of other news that I need to get to here, so I'm gonna do
[36:52.120 --> 36:59.400]  a couple things before I really focus on the big stacks of news that I have here.
[36:59.400 --> 37:05.480]  First of all, I just wanna say, Larry King did pass away over the weekend, we hadn't
[37:05.480 --> 37:11.080]  really mentioned that much, and I was listening to an old interview Larry King did, I guess
[37:11.080 --> 37:19.680]  it was from probably about, well maybe, I see when Michael Savage was on with Larry
[37:19.680 --> 37:27.520]  King, this had to be 2018 maybe or so, anyway Larry King, obviously a big liberal, one of
[37:27.520 --> 37:30.440]  the top talk show hosts ever, but he did an interview with Michael Savage, I went back
[37:30.440 --> 37:38.560]  and listened to it, and you know, in many ways Larry King, the death of Larry King represents
[37:38.560 --> 37:48.560]  the death of true liberal media, okay, it was 2016, wow, okay, 2016, in many ways, that
[37:48.560 --> 37:51.640]  had to be a different one, because this was post-President Trump, because they were talking
[37:51.640 --> 37:57.080]  about President Trump, it was when he came on to talk about Trump's war, that's a different
[37:57.080 --> 38:02.480]  book, but anyway, irrelevant, the point is, I'm listening to Michael Savage on with Larry
[38:02.480 --> 38:07.800]  King, talking about his book Trump's War, which I believe came out in 2016 or 2017,
[38:07.800 --> 38:17.560]  maybe it was 2015, but Larry King, the death of Larry King in many ways sadly is the death
[38:17.560 --> 38:31.000]  of actual liberals in media, Larry King was a liberal, but his approach to news and coverage
[38:31.000 --> 38:38.760]  was more important to him than liberal activism, he never hid who he was, he never hid his
[38:38.760 --> 38:45.320]  beliefs, but he was fair, he would hear the other arguments, I mean he had all kinds of
[38:45.320 --> 38:54.360]  conservative guests on, not just Michael Savage, and he gave him respect, that's gone, there's
[38:54.360 --> 39:01.720]  no longer a liberal in media that's not a full-on anti-American activist, and that's
[39:01.720 --> 39:07.280]  their number one goal, and so obviously the news suffers, it becomes left-wing Democrat
[39:07.280 --> 39:15.280]  propaganda, because they put the agenda, they put their activism ahead of their role as
[39:15.280 --> 39:27.800]  a talk show host or a reporter, so with Larry King, I believe liberal media is now dead,
[39:27.800 --> 39:35.560]  there is no more liberal media, it's only left-wing activism, Democrat propaganda, anti-American
[39:35.560 --> 39:42.960]  globalist garbage, that's all it is, I mean you got Glenn Greenwald, but I mean I'm not
[39:42.960 --> 39:56.080]  even sure he counts, so Godspeed to Larry King, the last true liberal, the last liberal talk
[39:56.080 --> 40:06.560]  show host is now gone, and so it was just refreshing to actually see and hear a liberal
[40:06.560 --> 40:14.480]  talk show host who's fair, who doesn't put his activism and agenda over his duty as
[40:14.480 --> 40:20.920]  a news reporter, and so to me that was highlighted with interviews that he did, such as the one
[40:20.920 --> 40:27.400]  with Michael Savage, but we'll pay our respects to Larry King here, obviously a legend in
[40:27.400 --> 40:32.080]  the business, but with Larry King, the death of Larry King is the death of liberal media,
[40:32.080 --> 40:41.600]  it's all activism now, so when we come back, I'm either going to get into this COVID news
[40:41.600 --> 40:48.800]  and just show the hypocrisy of Anthony Fauci, this rat man, you've heard of the Batman,
[40:48.800 --> 40:58.760]  but you now know of the rat man, Anthony Fauci, and then also President Trump, President Trump's
[40:58.760 --> 41:02.280]  office of the former president, I think I'm just going to call this the office of the
[41:02.280 --> 41:08.840]  president because Donald Trump is the president for all intents and purposes, he won the election,
[41:08.840 --> 41:18.040]  his words still have more weight than Biden's, and whenever President Trump makes his first
[41:18.040 --> 41:25.600]  statements or whatever he does from his office now in Mar-a-Lago, it's going to be highly
[41:25.600 --> 41:30.800]  anticipated and it's going to be highly viewed even by the media that hates him, so it's
[41:30.800 --> 41:35.560]  going to be an interesting exercise when President Donald Trump makes his statements again from
[41:35.560 --> 41:42.600]  his new office in Mar-a-Lago, and all of the attention that was ever on Biden will be shifted
[41:42.600 --> 41:48.600]  immediately to Trump, and it will once again prove Biden is illegitimate, has no support,
[41:48.600 --> 41:55.600]  Trump is the real president.
[41:55.600 --> 42:19.600]  Yes, sir, I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that

[42:30.600 --> 42:43.600]  trying to get a hold of you since Monday, and I've been trying to get a hold of you

[43:11.600 --> 43:26.600]  since Monday when I heard you got that information, and I've been trying to get a hold of you
[43:26.600 --> 43:38.600]  since Monday when I heard you got that information, and I've been trying to get a hold of you since
[43:38.600 --> 43:53.600]  Monday when I heard you got that information, and I've been trying to get a hold of you

[45:53.400 --> 45:58.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[46:11.240 --> 46:15.840]  They're on the case there. As for the actual legislation pending before
[46:15.840 --> 46:20.400]  Congress, we'll let Nancy Pelosi herself explain what's in it. Here's what she
[46:20.400 --> 46:26.000]  said about HR one back in October. We have plenty work to do in the Joe Biden
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.280]  administration. We're going to build the infrastructure of America in a green way.
[46:29.280 --> 46:36.680]  We're going to make sure health care is available to all Americans. We're going
[46:36.680 --> 46:42.440]  to have HR one HR one right off the bat be about cleaner government so that we
[46:42.440 --> 46:48.040]  can reduce the role of big dark special interest money. HR one is all about that
[46:48.040 --> 46:53.680]  big dark special interest money. Scary. Though you have to wonder why Nancy
[46:53.680 --> 46:58.320]  Pelosi is still using the term dark as a euphemism for bad. But whatever it's
[46:58.320 --> 47:02.120]  Nancy Pelosi so we can be sure it's not racism. Nancy Pelosi is a good person
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.480]  unlike you. The real question is how the party of ruthless corporate monopolies
[47:06.480 --> 47:10.360]  gets away with fake populist talking points like that. We need cleaner
[47:10.360 --> 47:14.520]  government shriek the puppets of Silicon Valley. The answer of course is they get
[47:14.520 --> 47:18.760]  away with it because no one stops them. This is the quote for the people act
[47:18.760 --> 47:22.600]  we're talking about here. It's for the people so shut up. Yeah for the people
[47:22.600 --> 47:26.960]  that is the Democratic Party intend to do for the people. Well if you guessed
[47:26.960 --> 47:31.680]  enshrine their own rule by force forever you win today's Daily Double. I'll take
[47:31.680 --> 47:36.120]  authoritarian political movements for a thousand Alex. Good job. The for the
[47:36.120 --> 47:39.840]  people act is the foundation of the Democratic Party strategy to control the
[47:39.840 --> 47:44.040]  federal government well into your grandchildren's middle age. Take a look
[47:44.040 --> 47:48.280]  at it. Like most revolutionary documents is not a very exciting read nothing and
[47:48.280 --> 47:52.160]  it sounds especially radical at first until you think about it. The bill
[47:52.160 --> 47:55.320]  begins by declaring that contrary to article one of the United States
[47:55.320 --> 48:00.080]  Constitution Congress has quote the ultimate supervisory power over federal
[48:00.080 --> 48:05.280]  elections. That's a big change under our current law states get to decide how
[48:05.280 --> 48:09.440]  much fraud they will tolerate. Florida requires you to show photo identification
[48:09.440 --> 48:14.160]  in order to vote. California just want to vote Democrat. The pushback is even
[48:14.160 --> 48:17.880]  though it wasn't successful when they stole the election from us. Stole it from
[48:17.880 --> 48:23.320]  Trump was enough for them to now want to change the entire law. On January 6 we
[48:23.320 --> 48:27.360]  had a riot at the U. S. Capitol. Why did that happen. It happened because
[48:27.360 --> 48:30.960]  millions of American voters were convinced that the last election was not
[48:30.960 --> 48:35.480]  fair. Where did they get that idea. Well it wasn't simply because the last
[48:35.480 --> 48:39.680]  president told them so. You're hearing that now as if they're animals who take
[48:39.680 --> 48:42.920]  commands and do what they're told but they're not animals. They're people.
[48:42.920 --> 48:45.960]  They're American citizens. You can see what's happening and comes to their own
[48:45.960 --> 48:51.200]  conclusions about it. They saw the radical increase in mail in voting.
[48:51.200 --> 48:56.360]  Millions did and it corroded their faith and the public's faith in our systems
[48:56.360 --> 49:01.160]  of election. They were enraged by that and some of them exploded. According to
[49:01.160 --> 49:05.160]  Democrats the lesson of that terrible day is that we need more of the corrupt
[49:05.160 --> 49:08.560]  policies that caused it in the first place. We need more mail in voting. We
[49:08.560 --> 49:11.720]  need more ballot harvesting. More corruption. That'll unite the country.
[49:11.720 --> 49:18.080]  More illegal immigrants. H.R.1 would literally enshrine fraud. Here's a
[49:18.080 --> 49:22.720]  direct quote from that legislation quote. A state may not require an
[49:22.720 --> 49:26.320]  individual to provide any form of identification as a condition of
[49:26.320 --> 49:31.400]  obtaining an absentee ballot. Any form of identification. I can't go to the gym
[49:31.400 --> 49:38.300]  without identification. Here's another direct quote from H.R.1 quote. A state
[49:38.300 --> 49:42.520]  may not require notarization or witness signature or other formal
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.960]  authentic authentication other than a voter's word for it as a condition of
[49:46.960 --> 49:52.720]  obtaining or casting an absentee ballot. Under H.R.1 paid political operatives
[49:52.720 --> 49:56.240]  could freely go house to house apartment to apartment collecting unknown
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.480]  thousands of ballots then dump them all at a ballot drop box and no one would
[50:01.480 --> 50:05.480]  have any idea of those ballots had been tampered with at any point along the way
[50:05.480 --> 50:10.040]  nor would they be any way to prove it if they had been tampered with and by the
[50:10.040 --> 50:13.720]  way H.R.1 also makes it harder for election observers to file complaints
[50:13.720 --> 50:18.560]  about any of this because complaining is racist. A system like that is
[50:18.560 --> 50:23.080]  suicidal for a democracy. No other free country would tolerate it. France and
[50:23.080 --> 50:26.560]  Canada don't tolerate it. They have banned mail-in ballots. They don't want
[50:26.560 --> 50:33.000]  fraud. Well it's incredible and of course it's Pelosi talking through a mask. I
[50:33.000 --> 50:51.840]  mean what a joke. I mean can you imagine. I mean what a joke man. You know what it
[50:51.840 --> 50:57.120]  really shows more than anything when you have Obama and Clinton and Biden all up
[50:57.120 --> 51:01.440]  on the inauguration stage all wearing masks. They're more enslaved than you
[51:01.440 --> 51:06.480]  are. Sure they've got the wealth and the fame and the power. They're more
[51:06.480 --> 51:14.120]  enslaved than you are. But you look at what the Democrats are trying to do
[51:14.120 --> 51:18.720]  right now with all the legislation labeling Trump supporters as domestic
[51:18.720 --> 51:23.600]  terrorists so they can be rounded up and thrown into a gulag. That's nice. That's
[51:23.600 --> 51:28.360]  we the people. That's what they say. That's for the people. Now that's for
[51:28.360 --> 51:33.720]  them and their criminal activity. By the way Ted Cruz and other Republicans in
[51:33.720 --> 51:37.880]  Congress have reintroduced the amendment imposing term limits on members of
[51:37.880 --> 51:40.880]  Congress. Problem is so many of these swamp creatures have been in what would
[51:40.880 --> 51:44.960]  be beyond the term limits they'd never vote for it. Pelosi obviously leading
[51:44.960 --> 51:51.360]  that class with Biden. So Pelosi's been robbing us dry as a corrupt politician
[51:51.360 --> 51:55.960]  for 50 years. She's not going to give up that mantle. You kidding me. Maxine
[51:55.960 --> 51:59.560]  Waters you kidding me. Besides these people wouldn't even know what to do in
[51:59.560 --> 52:05.000]  the real world. But let's take a look at what else the Democrats are doing right
[52:05.000 --> 52:13.040]  now. And it's all very unpopular. You know you talk about the roof or shall
[52:13.040 --> 52:17.880]  you say how Tucker said it. Americans being convinced that this election was
[52:17.880 --> 52:23.120]  stolen from them. It's not just all the voter fraud we saw. It's not just the
[52:23.120 --> 52:26.720]  anomalies of the election night that they're just it's so clear that they
[52:26.720 --> 52:32.000]  cheated. I mean what a joke. A second grade student could identify these
[52:32.000 --> 52:40.240]  anomalies. But no it's the fact that I'm dead serious. I don't know anybody who
[52:40.240 --> 52:45.960]  voted for Joe Biden. That is not a joke. I don't. I don't know a single person
[52:45.960 --> 52:51.040]  that voted for Joe Biden. My liberal friends either didn't vote or voted
[52:51.040 --> 52:57.400]  third party. I don't know anybody who voted for Biden. I'm not exaggerating. I
[52:57.400 --> 53:02.840]  don't know any person that voted for Joe Biden. I know more people that got
[53:02.840 --> 53:08.480]  COVID than voted for Biden. I was thinking about last night. I know five
[53:08.480 --> 53:13.040]  people who quote unquote got COVID. And most of them you wouldn't even hear
[53:13.040 --> 53:16.320]  about it except that it's COVID. So they tell everyone oh I just positive for
[53:16.320 --> 53:20.480]  COVID. Oh my gosh COVID COVID COVID. They just had a mild flu. And then I had a
[53:20.480 --> 53:25.280]  great aunt who is almost 90 years old. Smoking drank for 60 years of her life.
[53:25.280 --> 53:34.160]  Died of COVID. So I know more people that had COVID than voted for Biden. I'm
[53:34.160 --> 53:40.200]  serious. I don't know anyone that voted for Biden. But then you have the proof
[53:40.200 --> 53:43.280]  of internet which they're censoring now and it still doesn't even stop it from
[53:43.280 --> 53:47.480]  happening. Trump has all the internet popularity. Every video Trump does. Every
[53:47.480 --> 53:50.960]  speech millions of views. Nothing but thumbs up. Biden goes on the internet.
[53:50.960 --> 53:58.400]  It's a ghost town. You see a tumbleweed rolling through. Empty. You look at the
[53:58.400 --> 54:04.720]  rally size. So yeah we're totally convinced Trump won. No we know Trump
[54:04.720 --> 54:11.880]  won. They know Trump won. If you can find a Biden voter he probably knows Trump
[54:11.880 --> 54:20.760]  won. But Trump they said was an authoritarian. Oh but wait here's the
[54:20.760 --> 54:26.640]  story at Infowars.com. President executive order record record for who?
[54:26.640 --> 54:32.560]  Joe Biden. 33 executive orders. He hasn't even been in office a week. And most of
[54:32.560 --> 54:37.280]  these are just COVID BS. Just a flex like he's doing anything for COVID. It's
[54:37.280 --> 54:40.320]  really nothing. It's more just a government power grab. But then he's got
[54:40.320 --> 54:45.040]  three in there that are for transgenders. Got some in there to kill
[54:45.040 --> 54:49.120]  American energy. He's got some in there to open the borders. Borders are wide open
[54:49.120 --> 54:54.560]  folks. Oh okay. Oh well. Oh and the borders are not wide open. Well for all
[54:54.560 --> 54:59.480]  intensive purposes they are when now nine out of ten illegal immigrants are
[54:59.480 --> 55:04.240]  let into this country. Oh they'll be stopped at the border but they get let
[55:04.240 --> 55:10.560]  in. So where's that authoritarian? Well how about a guy who was never elected
[55:10.560 --> 55:17.520]  signing 33 executive orders in less than a week? Oh everything's fine at the
[55:17.520 --> 55:23.000]  border. Why do you always talk about the border? Everything's fine down there. It
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.280]  doesn't matter one in three children are trafficked and raped coming across the
[55:27.280 --> 55:31.560]  border and one in three women. That's fine. Remember Trump said or no no no
[55:31.560 --> 55:34.600]  Trump said oh one in three women are raped coming across southern border. CBS
[55:34.600 --> 55:38.160]  News fact checked it and said it's actually two out of three women. Trump
[55:38.160 --> 55:43.600]  huh. Okay so fine. More than half half of the women that come into America
[55:43.600 --> 55:50.880]  illegally from the southern border are raped. That's good. Charred bodies of
[55:50.880 --> 55:55.040]  Guatemalan migrants found at US Mexico border remains of nearly 20 migrants
[55:55.040 --> 56:02.720]  discovered in burning vehicles. That's what we want at the southern border. And
[56:02.720 --> 56:12.120]  ICE is the bad guy according to the Democrats. ICE. Oh my goodness. It
[56:12.120 --> 56:15.040]  doesn't stop there. Biden says he's replacing the federal government's
[56:15.040 --> 56:18.800]  fleet of vehicles with electric cars so that'll actually cause probably about
[56:18.800 --> 56:25.360]  10 times the carbon emissions. You know Democrats have now proposed the
[56:25.360 --> 56:32.600]  legislation for the federal minimum wage to be $15 by law by 2025. I'll get more
[56:32.600 --> 56:36.680]  into that. Now by the way the Democrats and the media are calling for
[56:36.680 --> 56:43.040]  telegram to be shut down. So that's coming up too. We have the technocrats are
[56:43.040 --> 56:47.360]  controlling the food supply secure your own safe source of food supply sale. It's
[56:47.360 --> 56:50.560]  the new prices in 2021 but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're
[56:50.560 --> 56:55.200]  gonna find at infowarstore.com subsection is prepared with Alex.com and
[56:55.200 --> 56:58.120]  it's all these globalists do this. And as they hoard the food and as they
[56:58.120 --> 57:02.680]  prepare you need to understand that you need 25 year food supply in the last
[57:02.680 --> 57:06.240]  25 years. One month, three months, six months, one year supplies and it's the
[57:06.240 --> 57:09.360]  highest quality you're gonna find. And it's just good to have that checkbox
[57:09.360 --> 57:12.920]  taken care of and you know you're getting good food at a very good price and
[57:12.920 --> 57:15.640]  you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this
[57:15.640 --> 57:21.640]  goes to us to fund our operation. So prepare with Alex.com or infowarstore.com
[57:21.640 --> 57:24.800]  you can find the preparedness section there water filtration air filtration
[57:24.800 --> 57:27.680]  it's all there. The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the
[57:27.680 --> 57:30.720]  force GMO and more. It's time to start getting prepared. It starts with
[57:30.720 --> 57:33.640]  self-defense. It starts with being prepared. It starts with horrible food.
[57:33.640 --> 57:37.200]  It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight. You'll win in the end.
[57:37.200 --> 57:44.720]  Lancaster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[57:44.720 --> 57:49.880]  Other dictionaries have similar ones. Terrorism is the threat of force or
[57:49.880 --> 57:55.520]  actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason. It's
[57:55.520 --> 57:59.480]  basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them. That's
[57:59.480 --> 58:03.840]  exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see the headlines from
[58:03.840 --> 58:08.080]  CNN ABC News. Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought. COVID more
[58:08.080 --> 58:12.640]  devastating than you'd ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million
[58:12.640 --> 58:17.760]  people would be dead just eight months ago within three months. Okay, it's a
[58:17.760 --> 58:22.080]  quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things. We're
[58:22.080 --> 58:26.480]  talking 96% at co-morbidity. These are real numbers. These are real facts. This
[58:26.480 --> 58:30.400]  is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are
[58:30.400 --> 58:33.440]  taught we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over the
[58:33.440 --> 58:39.080]  planet. You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you
[58:39.080 --> 58:42.120]  could put up with and survive.
[58:42.120 --> 59:10.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:10.680 --> 59:16.640]  Continuing on with the illegitimate man in the White House, Joe Biden, a man who
[59:16.640 --> 59:23.560]  was never elected president, who has now signed a record 33 executive orders. I
[59:24.840 --> 59:32.160]  mean, does it even hit home how dangerous that is? Does it even hit home how
[59:32.160 --> 59:35.680]  illegitimate it is? Does it even hit home how this is the death of the Republic
[59:35.680 --> 59:41.480]  when they can just install a man, put him in the White House who was never
[59:41.480 --> 59:50.040]  elected as the most unpopular politician in, I mean, when it comes to the
[59:50.040 --> 59:55.920]  modern day, Joe Biden's one of the most unpopular politicians. A man who's been
[59:55.920 --> 1:00:01.400]  in government for 50 plus years, a known liar, a known plagiarist, a known child
[1:00:01.400 --> 1:00:06.520]  molester, and they just install him. He doesn't even win. And then he signed 60,
[1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:10.200]  excuse me, 33 executive orders to probably be up to 60 by the time this month
[1:00:10.200 --> 1:00:17.240]  is over. 33 executive orders before his first week in office. Boy, you don't
[1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:22.640]  have a republic. You don't have a democratic republic. You have an
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:34.080]  authoritarian dictator regime. And this is how countries end, folks. This is how
[1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:38.680]  republics end. So, I mean, Joe Biden is the face of the death of America. Joe
[1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:43.320]  Biden is the face of the death of the Republic. Yeah, there's the famous video
[1:00:43.320 --> 1:00:50.360]  of Joe. We showed it. He just said, folks, I'm telling you, every day, Joe Biden
[1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:54.840]  wakes up, doesn't know where he is. They have to get him his meds, wake him up
[1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:59.120]  a little bit, tell him he's in the White House, all this stuff. And then he
[1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:01.960]  goes, sits at a desk. He's got a stack of executive orders. He just opens them
[1:01:01.960 --> 1:01:04.840]  and signs them. And he says, because he's so out of it, folks, you don't even
[1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:07.560]  know what's going on. He says it on camera. He says, I don't even know what
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:12.720]  I'm signing. It's like, you know, the old person that's in your family that's
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:16.360]  suffering in their old age, having some brain problems. And they sometimes they
[1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:20.120]  say things that they just, you know, don't think about. And it just comes out.
[1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:24.280]  That's Joe Biden. Hey, I don't even know what I'm signing up here. Just says it
[1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:35.240]  on live TV. And then of course signs it. Oh boy. But again, there, there, there
[1:01:35.240 --> 1:01:42.560]  is no Biden support. Yeah, you're gonna have the trendies. Yeah, you're gonna
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:47.480]  have some libtards. But I mean, for, for practical purposes, there is no Biden
[1:01:47.480 --> 1:01:50.760]  support. I'm not exaggerating, folks. I really don't know anybody that voted for
[1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:55.680]  Biden. I really do not know a single person that voted for Biden. It's
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:02:05.240]  incredible thing. But it's true. And so the Democrats now, though, are moving
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:09.880]  forward. They have proposed legislation. I have the bill right here to raise the
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:15.640]  federal minimum wage from $725 to $15 an hour by 2025. You know, I mean, look,
[1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:24.440]  it says the beginning of 2001, it's up to 950. Then one year after effective
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:30.080]  date 11, two years after effective date 1250, three years after effective date
[1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:37.040]  14, four years after effective date $15 an hour. And so that would be 2025. I
[1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:42.640]  mean, I understand both sides of this argument, because the way the federal
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:46.840]  minimum wage law was written, I think it would probably be actually closer to
[1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:52.720]  $20 an hour, but nobody really abides by that law. The problem is, if you
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:58.280]  institute a minimum wage and actually force that on to private businesses,
[1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:05.800]  many businesses will go under. Mostly in the service industry, they just won't
[1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:09.320]  be able to operate anymore. They can't afford to pay their employees that much.
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:13.840]  Now, I understand the notion when you have companies like Walmart and
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:21.520]  Microsoft and Amazon and the rest that pay their employees minimum wage and
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:26.080]  then have billions and billions of dollars like Apple. So I mean, that
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:29.880]  should be the target here. It shouldn't be the average place that has to pay
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:34.120]  $77 an hour. And just because that's what they can afford, you should be
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:40.600]  looking at companies in China, like Apple, that pay a penny a day for the
[1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:43.440]  people that make their cell phones. In fact, that's what they do. If you want
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:46.480]  to sell products in the United States, you have to pay your employees
[1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:52.320]  wherever they are that minimum wage. Three, two, one is back in stock. It's
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:54.560]  been sold out for over eight months. They couldn't get it because the
[1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:58.280]  lockdown pollen block is back in stock. Let me tell you a quick about it. The
[1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:01.600]  power of quail egg concentrate pollen block acts differently. The traditional
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:04.080]  line of history means that it's clinically studied to alleviate seasonal
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:07.360]  distress symptoms by helping to clear signage passages and adding respiratory
[1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:11.920]  function. It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it. And again, France has been
[1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:17.080]  shut down so we couldn't get it. Now a limited supply is back in stock 25% off
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:22.400]  at infowarstore.com pollen block again is available in this one minute ad. I
[1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:25.480]  don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:29.080]  it back in because it works naturally unlike some of the stuff that's over
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:33.280]  counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:37.320]  This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail don't have the
[1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:41.880]  seasonal distress and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us. You
[1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:46.160]  chew up the pills. They taste great. It's available again infowarstore.com
[1:04:46.160 --> 1:05:02.800]  pollen block infowarstore.com
[1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:08.800]  Big brother mainstream media government coverups. You want to stop
[1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:15.880]  tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones
[1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:20.400]  and welcome back. Thank you for joining us on this live Tuesday edition. I
[1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:24.440]  was lawyers about to take over interview constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes.
[1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:28.640]  He's also been advising President Trump last few months during this giant
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:33.600]  election fraud crisis. But I wanted to introduce this hour here on this
[1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:39.520]  Tuesday, January 26 2021 transmission and just to ask Barnes out of the gates
[1:05:40.240 --> 1:05:44.240]  to respond to the legislation that the head of the House Intelligence
[1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:49.800]  Committee, Schiff has introduced to create a new domestic spy force to use
[1:05:49.800 --> 1:05:54.480]  the CIA and the NSA openly on the American people. This is the guy that
[1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:57.400]  obviously got caught illegally spying on President Trump when he was president
[1:05:57.400 --> 1:06:02.080]  elected while he was president. He tried to run several coups as we know. But
[1:06:02.080 --> 1:06:05.440]  now this is even gotten Tulsi Gabbard's and many others upset. Even the squad
[1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:10.120]  is upset because they realize that this will take away any of their rights to
[1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:15.600]  even peacefully demonstrate or speak out. So I really want to get his take on
[1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:21.640]  Schiff introduces legislation to create a federal domestic terrorism crime
[1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:27.360]  system and just how draconian this is. And then after he speaks to that,
[1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:32.520]  I'm going to be listening while I'm on vacation, my workcation here in Utah. I
[1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:37.800]  would like to hear him also get into the wheels coming off of my view on these
[1:06:37.800 --> 1:06:41.880]  gene therapy MRNAs. You know, it was Barnes six months ago pointing out these
[1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:46.080]  are not really classical vaccines. These are new drugs. These are genetic
[1:06:46.080 --> 1:06:50.200]  engineering, mutinogenic drugs. And now to have Merck coming out and suspending
[1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:53.040]  their vaccine program, pulling back two vaccines saying they're not safe and
[1:06:53.040 --> 1:06:56.280]  that none of the shots are safe. Basically, that's what the other scientists
[1:06:56.280 --> 1:06:59.560]  have been saying and to have the WHO saying pregnant women shouldn't take
[1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:03.280]  these MRNA vaccines and all these deaths that are being caused sometimes within
[1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:07.520]  an hour of taking a shot. I mean, they can't cover it all up. They can't
[1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:10.600]  cover up all the Hank Aaron's that they're killing, especially when a lot of
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:14.280]  these people are 20 years old, 50 years old. You name it. So I want his take on
[1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:17.720]  this medical tyranny, this big test, this big power grab. And I think it's
[1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:21.040]  really starting to fail. So what comes next? Because the police with this 50
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:24.800]  year old man that died yesterday, two hours after he took the shot, first he
[1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:28.880]  got paralyzed and was having convulsions. Well, first his feet and hands became
[1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:31.440]  numb, then he began to get paralyzed and he had convulsions and he died.
[1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:35.400]  That's the classic thing that happens. The police are saying we don't care if
[1:07:35.400 --> 1:07:39.920]  this vaccine has a liability protection. That's civil. That's that 1986 act.
[1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:43.440]  They said, but if something's killing people, I don't care if you've got a
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:47.720]  law saying civilly somebody's protected. It doesn't matter. We have a right to
[1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:52.760]  investigate and so do grand juries. So what is that principle in law? I know
[1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:55.800]  it's there just in common sense. I feel that I know it and the police feel that
[1:07:55.800 --> 1:07:59.440]  know it too. But how do we get a movement going to say we don't care if you
[1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:02.400]  have a liability protection? You can pass a law saying child molestation is
[1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:05.120]  legal. We're not going to put up with it. You can pass a law saying slavery is
[1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:08.000]  legal again. We're not going to put up with it. So really big things happen.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:11.440]  Those are the two areas I want to hit. And then also with Barnes, get into
[1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:15.400]  this new office of the former president, you know, the Clinton Sopter Foundation
[1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:18.880]  and things. I'm glad Trump's moving in this direction. I think he should be
[1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:23.440]  his administration in exile and point that out and not back down. I think this
[1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:27.160]  is a toothless threat. This Senate trial coming up. We've got a report now
[1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:30.400]  posted at Bandai video when I had a security lays off the real timeline.
[1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:33.040]  And the fact that it was basically a false flag. It tricked a few hundred
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:38.160]  patriots in. So those are the big three issues. You've got the vaccine wheels
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:41.840]  coming off. You've got the anti terrorism move against the American people
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:45.360]  literally saying arrestable for their thoughts. And then you've got what's
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:50.640]  happening with Trump and the trial coming up. So Robert Barnes is coming up.
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:55.520]  I give you Owen shroyer in the info wars new center in Austin, Texas info wars
[1:08:55.520 --> 1:09:02.640]  dot com news wars dot com and dot video. All right, Robert Barnes with us now. The
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:08.880]  three topics of discussion laid out by Alex Bob. Let's begin with the vaccine
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:14.480]  issue because you know, I don't want to see doctors or nurses in the crosshairs
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:18.240]  of this, but it feels like they're kind of being put in that position as the
[1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:23.920]  middleman legally to take the slings and arrows here because the vaccine
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:29.280]  manufacturers do have the immunity upon not intended from litigation with the
[1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:32.160]  damage of the vaccines. But the police and other people are looking and they're
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:34.240]  like, look, all these people are dying from the vaccine. There has to be an
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:38.160]  investigation, something here. So what do you think the law says? I mean,
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:42.720]  is it is it the sad truth that it's going to ultimately be the nurse or the
[1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:46.800]  doctor that actually plunges the needle into the arm of the deadly vaccine
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:51.280]  that that kills the person that's going to be legally liable for these deaths?
[1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:56.480]  Or how do you see this going, Bob Barnes? Well, criminally, the drug companies can
[1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:01.600]  definitely be prosecuted if they knowingly created an undue health risk and
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:05.760]  danger to the country. Now there's not only do they have certain forms of
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:10.560]  immunity under law from civil suit, depending on the nature of the vaccine,
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:15.200]  but they also have basically a different kind of emergency immunity from
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:19.360]  emergency legislation. Because a lot of this was authorized as emergency
[1:10:19.360 --> 1:10:24.880]  vaccines, emergency drugs, that creates a host of additional protection for the
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:30.800]  drug company. But the degree to which they know, knew of a risk and hid that risk,
[1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:36.160]  then they could be criminally prosecuted both under various state law jurisdiction
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:40.160]  and federal law jurisdiction. And that wouldn't mostly not go to the nurse or the
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:44.000]  doctor that would go to unless the nurse and the doctor knew of the risk.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:48.160]  That would go to the drug company itself. Now, unfortunately, there's not a history
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:52.880]  of a lot of state prosecutors or federal prosecutors taking action against big drug
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:57.280]  companies, even when they deliberately distributed opioids like they were heroin
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:05.040]  over the past two decades, creating a opioid addiction epidemic across the United States that
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:09.440]  frankly, in many respects, was more collaterally damaging than COVID ever has been.
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:12.640]  Oh, I think that's totally proven with the numbers.
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:18.880]  Yeah, I had no doubt about it. So hopefully they do something about it. But out of the gate,
[1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:23.520]  there's, yeah, there is criminal exposure. There is criminal exposure for the drug companies.
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:28.480]  It'll simply be a matter of political will. Will the investigators do something about it?
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:32.480]  Will the prosecutors do something about it? But at both the state and federal level,
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:37.840]  there is no immunity for deliberately distributing a drug that has undisclosed
[1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:40.480]  health risks that could lead to someone's severe injury or death.
[1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:45.520]  Well, and I just think about the employees or even, you know, government employees or
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:49.680]  employees of companies where they've been told they have to get the vaccine or, you know,
[1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:53.680]  airlines saying you have to get the vaccine. So it now becomes this mandate and all these
[1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:58.240]  different walks of life. I mean, what about them? If they care about their employees and they see
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:03.280]  all the side effects of the vaccine happening, I mean, you'd think there'd be a push from the
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:07.040]  private industry or even the government saying, Hey, wait a second, we've forced people to have
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:11.440]  this on the notion of safe and effective. Now people are getting sick and dying from it.
[1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:15.840]  You'd think there'd be some motivation there to stand up for the employees.
[1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:22.080]  Well, and I think there could be civil liability for employers or other people that are or
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:28.320]  educational institutions or other people that are or airlines that are compelling the vaccine to
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:31.680]  the degree that they get to that place. There's mostly been threats. They haven't moved to the
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:36.080]  stage of actually compelling it yet because they don't have the same immunity as the drug company
[1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:42.240]  has. So just because the drug company can't be sued and nobody in the medical chain can be sued
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:47.920]  for delivering the vaccine does not mean that an employer cannot be sued for compelling its use
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:54.480]  or an airline can't be sued for compelling its use. So I think they're there. They face different
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:13:00.000]  levels of civil exposure. And indeed, you know, I'm working with Robert Kennedy on bringing
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:06.320]  Robert Kennedy Jr. on bringing suits against educational institutions, employers, and anyone
[1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:10.560]  else who tries to compel this vaccine is a condition of access to education, a condition
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:16.160]  of access to employment, a condition of access of your constitutionally protected right to travel.
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:21.600]  So we're going to be filing suits on that, talking to a pilot, worried about it in the context of
[1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:27.280]  the airlines, talking to teachers in the context of educational institutions, talking to government
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:32.240]  employees in the condition of government employment, and private individuals in the case of private
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:37.200]  employment, including CEOs and executives who are concerned about it. So it's to my knowledge,
[1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:41.920]  it's never been compelled in the history of America has either an educational institution
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:49.520]  or an employment institution compelled you to get a new flu like vaccine as a condition of access.
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:54.160]  And so I think there's ways and means to challenge it and contest it. We're working on ways to do
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:59.040]  so. Suits have already been brought in the case of educational institutions, and they will be brought
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:03.840]  against other institutions as well. Because as you note, and it's Alex, here's the best summary
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:09.120]  of the entire vaccine issued to date. Alex Baranson, a liberal report, a former reporter
[1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:13.840]  from the New York Times, who's wrote multiple books on this and mostly a spy novel writer,
[1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:19.360]  says that there's no way he will allow his kids to get this vaccine. So what and he's been studying
[1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:23.440]  this in more detail independently than anybody. So what does that tell you about the safety and
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:28.720]  security of this vaccine? Well, and that may be the answer to my next question, which we'll get on
[1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:34.080]  the other side of this break, which would be, what is the genesis of this legal fight? I mean,
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:41.360]  where does it even begin? Because the, you know, the liability protection of the vaccine. I've got
[1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:46.000]  some bad news. Our best selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people understand
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.480]  in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:56.960]  But here's the good news. Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation,
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:02.240]  so good for your immune system. And we've got two great turmeric formulas. One is body's ultimate
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:08.560]  turmeric formula that is a dried turmeric extract 95% humanoid. People love it. That's selling out.
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:13.920]  But despite that, it's still discounted and then for store.com. And then also selling out this week
[1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:19.440]  is our liquid turmeric extract is called liquid turmeric extract. People really love it. It's
[1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:24.480]  extremely strong as well. It's selling out and your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your
[1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:29.360]  body. It also funds the info war and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:34.880]  So thank you all for your support. Please visit infowarstore.com and find so many other great
[1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:39.760]  items that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the info war. God bless and good
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:43.280]  luck. The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now,
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:47.120]  if you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything.
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:52.560]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy
[1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:56.640]  week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo force is my favorite and
[1:15:56.640 --> 1:16:00.400]  all the info wars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:05.840]  not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning
[1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:10.480]  and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up today.
[1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:14.400]  You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:18.080]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that
[1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:21.440]  happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:25.120]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:28.960]  person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay,
[1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:31.840]  I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health. And that's why
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:35.280]  you need to go to info wars.com, take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:39.200]  Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid's bad
[1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:46.080]  and the turbo force is good. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:17.040]  Back when earth used to be fun. Now we have White House press briefings,
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:23.200]  where all the members of the press are wearing double masks, double masks. And now the Canadian
[1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:27.520]  health officials are saying you need to wear at least three masks. Well, I got news for you.
[1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:32.080]  You should be wearing at minimum 10 masks, 30 masks if you really want to be safe.
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:37.680]  33 masks. Actually, you should wear a mask for every executive order that Joe Biden signed. So
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:44.080]  that would be 33 as of today, quickly increasing. All right, I'm getting distracted by the madness
[1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:49.280]  of that. We have constitutional attorney Robert Barnes on with us right now. We've got a lot of
[1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:53.520]  things to check off the list with him. But I want to kind of finish up what we were talking about
[1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:59.040]  earlier. I think he may have answered my question with the litigation he's working on right now.
[1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:06.160]  But more specifically, Robert Barnes, what is the beginning of this? The liability protection
[1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:10.960]  from big pharma and specifically vaccine manufacturers where these vaccines are
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:15.840]  pretty much already mandated. I mean, you can fight it and maybe get out of it to go to a public
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:20.400]  school or something. But for most, for all intents and purposes, we already have mandatory vaccines.
[1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:26.720]  Children get damaged, children die. They are allowed to sue. There's a vaccine special court,
[1:18:26.720 --> 1:18:30.560]  vaccine special payout program. Most people don't know about this. So that's been so
[1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:35.760]  institutionalized and ingrained into the general medical practice. Yeah, there's me with my masks
[1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:40.560]  being very safe. I told you first to wear 33 masks. I was ahead of the rest of the health
[1:18:40.560 --> 1:18:45.840]  officials there. But getting serious, what do you think is the beginning of this? Because
[1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:52.080]  there's never really been the attention on the vaccines like with COVID, because it really
[1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:57.120]  is affecting everybody, at least in their in their purview of the world. So what do you think is
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:00.880]  the beginning? I mean, we've seen so many people die, so many negative health effects,
[1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:04.640]  so many of the vaccine manufacturers even pulling back saying, okay, you know what,
[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:10.560]  we got to pull back. These are having bad side effects. But where does the damn break on this,
[1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:17.040]  Robert? How do you think the damn breaks on this protections that the vaccine manufacturers have
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:20.800]  from all the damages that have happened from the vaccine specifically with COVID?
[1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:25.920]  I mean, I think it's become educational. So because of the way in which this vaccine has
[1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:30.560]  gone through, it has some immunities, but not the same scale and scope of immunities of other
[1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:35.680]  vaccines, particularly emergency approval, vaccines have a different level of legal review
[1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:42.800]  and other aspects to it. The so the two things need to happen. One is a lot of people are actually
[1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:49.360]  unaware of all the special laws that make it tough to sue vaccine makers. Because the typical
[1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:55.520]  vaccine was a vaccine that's been around half a century, or at least perceived to be that involves
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:20:01.040]  very dangerous diseases that have been mostly eradicated through various therapeutic treatments.
[1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:06.080]  And it mostly involved young children, usually babies, one, two, three years old,
[1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:12.240]  and it was involved access to public education. And so outside of a small group of people, most
[1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:18.000]  people didn't know really about these special immunities for vaccine makers, how informed consent
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:24.320]  is not as often not required of vaccine makers, how even the doctor or nurse can be immune,
[1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:30.320]  even when they make a basic mistake like give two shots or give the wrong shot. And all this was
[1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:37.280]  done in the 90s in order to help sort of an extortion campaign by Big Pharma to say we're
[1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:42.400]  not even going to make these vaccines unless you Congress give us special immunities for making them.
[1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:47.840]  And legally, my view has always been if you have a product that a jury will find so dangerous,
[1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:51.680]  that you can't make that product, then you shouldn't be making that product. That should be
[1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:56.240]  the answer, not special immunity for them. But that's precisely what took place. So they had
[1:20:56.240 --> 1:21:02.320]  locked in guaranteed profits with basically no meaningful risk or exposure. The vaccine court
[1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:08.240]  limits damages tremendously, prevents public information and public disclosure quite frequently,
[1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:14.480]  disallows discovery of a meaningful manner. And most importantly, precludes and prevents
[1:21:14.480 --> 1:21:20.000]  either punitive damages or a jury from assessing damages at any rate. It's done by a specialized
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:26.560]  court with specialized politicians in DC. And it's not consistent with the jury trial, right?
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:31.040]  But our courts, of course, have again turned a blind eye to that. But in this context,
[1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:35.840]  there's a lot of grounds to challenge it. And that's where Robert Kennedy Jr.'s Organization
[1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:41.520]  Children's Defense Fund, I've been talking to them over the last about four or five months.
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:48.080]  And he recognized right away that we needed to have a cross-party, cross-idiology alignment
[1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:53.360]  of lawyers committed to civil rights and civil liberties to expose the drug-making industry
[1:21:54.240 --> 1:22:01.040]  writ large. And this provides a perfect example for it. More and more people are waking up to the
[1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:06.400]  reality of, I mean, over the World Economic Forum, they want to talk about the great reset,
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:12.000]  the great awakening. But the real awakening is how dangerous these people are in positions of power.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:16.960]  And in particular, as it relates to vaccines, we've only tried, we've never had a successful
[1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:25.040]  COVID vaccine before. Number one, number two, as Alex repeatedly reiterates, this is an mRNA vaccine,
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:30.800]  which makes it uniquely dangerous and uniquely experimental, because it is meant to change
[1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:35.680]  potentially your DNA itself. And this is not something we should be experimenting with, period.
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:42.720]  Last but not least, the only time we tried to rush and force through a flu type vaccine,
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:50.240]  which is what this fundamentally is, was in 1976 with the swine flu. And that was a monumental
[1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:57.280]  disaster and debacle, even CBS's 60 Minutes back in 1977, detailed and demonstrated. Thus,
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:03.120]  you can still find it in various places, the old video footage from the interviews and the story
[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:08.480]  that they told. And it's just been conveniently memory-hold by the institutional media and the
[1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:14.240]  institutional press. But the reality is, it's amazing that the drug company's genius really in
[1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:20.320]  the area of vaccines is to take a drug, because that's all a vaccine is, stick a fancy label on it,
[1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:26.080]  like vaccine, instead of call it, hey, we want to force drugs into your body that are experimental,
[1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:29.760]  and we're not sure really how they work because there hasn't been enough time to understand it
[1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:34.400]  or appreciate it. And we have no economic incentive to really care because we make our
[1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:41.600]  profit with almost no risk. But just by labeling it vaccine somehow magically and miraculously,
[1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:48.640]  it has these mythical divine qualities. And then this is also why over the past decade,
[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:56.560]  the institutional press has been waging war against people questioning the efficacy and ethics of
[1:23:56.560 --> 1:24:03.440]  coerced or uninformed consent vaccines by calling them, quote, anti-vaxxers. I mean,
[1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:09.920]  that's how they ruined the career of a doctor in the United Kingdom solely because he raised
[1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:15.600]  questions about the efficacy and ethics of certain vaccines. This is really, as Robert
[1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:20.480]  Kennedy Jr. does a good job of explaining, this is an informed consent movement. This is not an
[1:24:20.480 --> 1:24:26.400]  anti-vaxx or anti-drug movement. It's just not a pro-vaxx or pro-drug movement. It's a pro-informed
[1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:33.040]  consent movement. After Nuremberg is part of the Nuremberg Code, we agreed that we were not going
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:38.800]  to ever experiment on human beings again because that's what the Nazis did. And that's what the
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:43.200]  Nuremberg Code is all about. And that's supposed to be part of our tort law, supposed to be part
[1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:47.280]  of our international code, supposed to be part of human rights, supposed to be part of the Fourth
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:52.640]  Amendment to the United States Constitution. And yet our courts have taken a precariously blind
[1:24:52.640 --> 1:24:58.800]  eye to these legal invasions and incursions on that right because that's what this issue is about.
[1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:03.840]  If someone wants to take the vaccine, absolutely have at it, but they should have informed consent.
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:08.480]  Yeah, and they should have legal protection if the vaccine does them permanent damage. So it
[1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:15.120]  sounds to me like the answer is what the push has been from the beginning and that public awareness
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:20.000]  is just now that the COVID vaccine has so much attention on it and they're actually covering
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:23.840]  the negative side effects now. Normally they wouldn't do that. The opportunity for public
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:30.240]  awareness increases and then maybe you can parlay that into some successful litigation with the
[1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:35.040]  public behind you now. All right, we're going to come back more with Robert Barnes. We're going
[1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:39.360]  to talk to him about the Democrats proposing legislation to put you in jail. The Pope came
[1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:44.320]  out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and
[1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:48.560]  create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and Global
[1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:52.720]  Corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[1:25:52.720 --> 1:26:00.080]  It's all now completely official part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab,
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:04.160]  all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation,
[1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:09.360]  all the rest of them, a 10 to 21, a 10 to 30, it's here and only gets worse like being fed
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:16.400]  into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all. And the rejection starts with
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:21.600]  realizing it's spiritual battle, good versus evil and stopping abortion. We must start
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:27.120]  valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:33.920]  disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that, we are all slaves. We must stand up and
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:42.480]  declare our basic God-given human rights now. President Trump won in the landslide on November
[1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:48.240]  3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let that happen. They had to have some way to repudiate
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:53.920]  the populist movement emanating from the United States and it spread across the world from the
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:59.040]  UK to Brazil. They were desperate. They admitted their own publications. They didn't know what to do.
[1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:06.240]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots by the state law and stole it better than death.
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:10.880]  And now they're coming after the president. They're coming after you. They're coming after me.
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:15.440]  They're shutting everybody off the internet. They're trying to totally censor us. And that's why
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:20.160]  Info Wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming. We told you this was coming.
[1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:25.360]  We were the first main target that we're still on air at infowars.com and newswars.com and band
[1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:29.440]  up with you. Without your word of mouth, without your prayer, without your financial support,
[1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:34.080]  we can't stay on air. So while you still can, go to infowarstore.com and get storeable foods and

[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:52.160]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:58.080]  used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According
[1:27:58.080 --> 1:28:04.240]  to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:10.000]  be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:15.520]  social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the
[1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:21.760]  world by many who enjoy its serious benefits. The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a
[1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:28.320]  full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill,
[1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:33.920]  organic Skolkapp and Balarian root. We do expect to sell this new product quickly,
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:42.240]  so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:11.200]  I'm Robert Barnes with you. We change topics of discussion to
[1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:17.200]  a new bill being proposed by Democrats, but it's actually not new. In fact,
[1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:23.680]  it was Adam Schiff that proposed this two years ago. Schiff introduces legislation to
[1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:30.400]  create a federal domestic terrorism crime. And so it kind of went unheard at the time.
[1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:34.720]  And the Democrats were up to so much shenanigans at the time that it kind of went uncovered and
[1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:42.720]  just kind of faded away. But now with the events from January 6th still in people's minds, it comes
[1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:49.760]  back with more force and fervor than ever. And so the Democrats, once again, that they introduced
[1:29:49.760 --> 1:29:56.400]  this bill two years ago, are now saying we need to label Trump supporters. Let's call it what it is,
[1:29:56.400 --> 1:30:03.840]  label Trump supporters, domestic terrorists, insurrectionists, so that we can send the
[1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:09.280]  law enforcement teams after them, whether it be the FBI or local law enforcement, whoever they
[1:30:09.280 --> 1:30:16.480]  can get to cooperate will be fine for them to arrest millions of Trump supporters after labeling
[1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:21.440]  them domestic terrorists. Tulsi Gabbard understands the dangers of this. She's been doing TV interviews,
[1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:30.400]  talking about how bad it is. And of course, it's Adam Schiff, the one doing this. Believe me, folks,
[1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:34.560]  Adam Schiff doesn't want the world to know what he does in private. I'll leave it right there.
[1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:39.920]  But Robert Barnes, constitutional attorney, legal expert with me here.
[1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:45.840]  You know, aside from the legal argument that's being made here, we can get to that too.
[1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:54.480]  You know, for all practical purposes, this is a major political party labeling any of its
[1:30:54.480 --> 1:31:01.680]  opposition terrorists, and then having it actually written down in law and legislation to do it so
[1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:08.240]  they can execute, you know, the mass arrests or the detentions that they want. I mean, is this
[1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:12.800]  something unheard of in American law? I mean, I'm just trying to think, I mean, even in World War
[1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:18.640]  II, when they were putting Japanese people in camps, you know, there's a lot of debate about that.
[1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:23.120]  There were thousands of Japanese spies that were found. I'm not saying it was a good thing
[1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:30.320]  or not to put them in camps. But the point is, has there ever been a notion or a proposed
[1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:38.880]  legislation like this, where an entire political party wants to label its opposition as terrorist
[1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:45.840]  to begin the process of arresting them or, you know, getting them out of the free market?
[1:31:45.840 --> 1:31:51.120]  Have you ever seen anything like this? Well, there are historical examples of it. And essentially,
[1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:56.480]  what they want to do is they want to take out the worst examples from our history and aggregate them
[1:31:56.480 --> 1:32:02.320]  and combine them together and accelerate them to an entirely new level. So, you know, during the
[1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:07.600]  beginning of the country, John Adams tried to pass the and did pass the alien and sedition acts,
[1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:12.320]  which were intended to criminalize political dissent in the country. It was so controversial,
[1:32:12.320 --> 1:32:17.040]  it led to his party being thrown out of power, Thomas Jefferson pardoning everybody who was
[1:32:17.040 --> 1:32:22.160]  ever fined or prosecuted under those laws. And we promised that we would never resuscitate those
[1:32:22.160 --> 1:32:28.080]  laws. But we have sporadically done so, such as during World War I and during some of the
[1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:32.880]  so-called foreign terror prosecutions in the 1990s. And those are the sedition laws,
[1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:38.800]  they're now talking about reinvigorating using the Capitol Hill riots as the pretext. The second
[1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:43.680]  example that really took place to some degree, Lincoln, during the Civil War, he suspended the
[1:32:43.680 --> 1:32:49.200]  right writ of habeas corpus in places that were not even part of war. And the U.S. Supreme Court
[1:32:49.200 --> 1:32:55.840]  1866 recognized that was patently unconstitutional, you couldn't do so. But again, war has been the
[1:32:55.840 --> 1:33:01.120]  most common pretext for this, because the next two time periods we really faced it were World War
[1:33:01.120 --> 1:33:07.680]  I and World War II. In World War I, the Palmer raids were used in a range of other activities,
[1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:12.400]  and the sedition acts were reinvigorated. So Eugene V. Debs went to prison for giving a speech.
[1:33:13.120 --> 1:33:18.800]  People went to prison for simply distributing anti-war pamphlets. And of course those
[1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:24.320]  anti-war people were right, World War I gave us fascism, World War I gave us communism, World War
[1:33:24.320 --> 1:33:31.520]  I gave us World War II. So the critics were right, and those who locked them up were wrong, but
[1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:37.120]  even the court went along with it. Then we reinvigorated again, as you note, World War II,
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:42.000]  this time using ancestry as the pretext. While many people know about the massive detention
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:47.520]  camps simply based on Japanese ancestry, they don't know that in fact also German populations
[1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:51.920]  were put under undue suspicion, simply for being German. And the only reason why they didn't lock
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:56.720]  up all the Germans is because that was about 20% of the country in different parts of the country.
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:02.800]  So it was impractical to do so, but that was the next effort at sort of spying on your domestic
[1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:08.560]  political opponents or perceived political opponents. And then the Cold War was the last
[1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:15.040]  justification for this kind of behavior. And what they're really trying to do is take the old alien
[1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:20.080]  and sedition acts and the sedition laws that they used to target political dissidents in the past,
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:25.520]  look at examples like the Palmer raids and the Kormatsu case of mass detention camps,
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:31.760]  and add them and aggregate them together to the Cointel program run under the guys of supporting
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:38.160]  the Cold War from the 1950s through the 1970s. The head of the Cointel program, of course,
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:44.720]  was Mark Felt, who was in fact the guy that later was a deep throat taking out President Nixon,
[1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:51.920]  because Nixon attempted to dehooverize the FBI. And as part of the broader picture here,
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:57.920]  what they're trying to do is not only reinvigorate Cointel Pro, bring back the sedition laws to
[1:34:57.920 --> 1:35:04.480]  target political dissidents, legitimize spying on political opponents. They want to take all of
[1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:10.320]  the extraordinary remedies of the Patriot Act and invasive components of the Patriot Act that was
[1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:16.240]  meant to be constitutional only because it was a foreign policy, not a domestic policy,
[1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:23.120]  and apply it now to their domestic political opponents. To give an example, the ACLU,
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:29.040]  after Schiff put out this proposal two years ago, and Biden himself put out a proposal about six
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:35.520]  months ago, mighty coincidental how these Capitol Hill riots perfectly play into the script of the
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:41.440]  deep state actors, not only in discrediting and damaging the president's reputation, but also
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:47.280]  in unleashing these new domestic terror laws. And the laws are written so broadly, they cover
[1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:52.000]  things that do not fit the conventional or colloquial understanding of domestic terror.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:56.160]  All that it has to be is you have to do something for politicized purposes
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:00.320]  that might be considered dangerous by somebody that violates some law somewhere.
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:06.480]  So as the ACLU pointed out, almost every activist leftist organization has been violating these
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:10.880]  laws for 30 plus years if they're suddenly going to start being applied across the board.
[1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:14.400]  So it's not just going to be limited to the right. Now, they want to do it to the Trump
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:19.440]  people in particular. And what they want to do is to not only weaponize it by expanding the
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:25.280]  definition of domestic terror, creating special criminalized statutes, so that like right now,
[1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:31.360]  a trespassing law say if you trespass on the federal property for protest purposes, usually you
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:36.160]  don't even get much time, maybe a year. They want to make it mandatory minimums of between 10 and
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:42.720]  35 years in federal prison. These are Stalin-esque type sentences meant to intimidate and terrorize
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:47.680]  their political opponents from using certain options and alternatives to them that have
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:52.240]  historically been available without that kind of severity of consequence. But here's the other
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:56.960]  big thing with it. It allows spying on all of your educational records, spying on all of your
[1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:03.520]  medical records, spying on your employment records, all of which they can do without getting a,
[1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:09.520]  without probable cause of a crime. Because what it is, is a shift wants to take all of the patriot
[1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:15.360]  tax provisions for international terrorists and essentially create a domestic FISA court
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:21.520]  that authorizes co-intel proactivity without probable cause of a crime against their political
[1:37:21.520 --> 1:37:25.680]  opponents. And the additional component of this is they're trying to pass legislation
[1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:31.360]  to spend massive money so that this becomes the number one priority of the FBI. This is
[1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:38.080]  co-intel pro on steroids. This is the Patriot Act on steroids. And what it would do is the biggest
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:43.280]  threat as well, aside from the surveillance, the spying and the sentencing risk that it creates,
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:49.360]  is seizure risks. If you're seen as an organization or individual who financially assisted or there
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:55.200]  was any assets that you have access to, that they decide those assets were somehow connected to
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:59.680]  any of these disfavorite events, they can just come in and seize them and keep them forever,
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:04.400]  seize them and steal them. And this is an extraordinary power that effectively could
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:09.600]  bankrupt political organizations that resist President Biden. So it's a dangerous, perilous
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:15.280]  time. We are facing the greatest constitutional crisis in American legal history in 2021,
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:19.760]  between the lockdowns and the domestic terror legislation that isn't about domestic terror.
[1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:24.560]  It's about spying on your political opponents. It's about sending your political opponents to
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:29.760]  prison. And it's about seizing their assets if they attempt to resist you. And I'm not supporting
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:33.680]  any of this that's happened in the past, but at least in the past, it was for a pro-American
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:37.840]  agenda. The people proposing this now, they hate America, folks. They're open about it.
[1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:44.000]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply, secure your own safe source of food
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.240]  supply sale. It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high-quality food
[1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:53.120]  you're going to find at infowarstore.com. The subsection is prepared with alex.com. And it's
[1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:57.840]  all these globalists do this. And as they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need to understand
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:02.640]  that you need 25-year food supply in the last 25 years, one month, three months, six months,
[1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:06.320]  one year supplies. And it's the highest quality you're going to find. And it's just good to have
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:10.800]  that checkbox taken care of. And you know you're getting good food at a very good price. And you
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:15.200]  know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:21.280]  operation. So prepare with alex.com or infowarstore.com. You can find the preparedness section there,
[1:39:21.280 --> 1:39:25.280]  water filtration, air filtration. It's all there. The technocrats are getting ready to bring in
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:29.120]  all the forced GMO and more. It's time to start getting prepared. It starts with self-defense.
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:32.800]  It starts with being prepared. It starts with horrible food. It starts with digging in for
[1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:40.240]  the long globalist fight. You'll win in the end. We told you it was coming under the United
[1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:45.600]  Nations pilot program in Singapore. For eight months they've made citizens wear bracelets on
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:49.920]  their arms that makes them a social distance and report them back to cell towers to track
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:55.360]  through every movement. This is for everybody. The way it gets better. Now France has programs
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:00.800]  in their factories, government push and sponsor, to make everyone wear actual dog collars. You can
[1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:06.080]  make a social distance and report back to several computers. They're turning us into a commodity.
[1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:10.880]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years. It's all being announced. They are literally taking
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:15.440]  over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations down the planet.
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:20.720]  They own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced. Do you understand?
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:25.680]  It is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level and now they're coming with dog
[1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:30.400]  collars and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S. Starting next year it will begin.
[1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:35.360]  Did you hear me? Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:37.440]  Imple Wars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:45.440]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best selling products in

[1:43:32.080 --> 1:43:36.320]  we're going right back to in a moment so this is the greatest crisis in american history this is a
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:41.680]  multinational corporate concerted effort to federalize the elections into the democrats so the
[1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:47.120]  states can't expose all the fraud that just came out and then block it uh to to to shut down everybody's
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:52.320]  free speech to forcibly inoculate everyone to bring in every form of tyranny and and now to say
[1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:56.720]  we're going to use the military this is one of the press conference last week with biden
[1:43:56.720 --> 1:44:01.600]  they all repeated what brennan said which shows he's one of the guys with obama running this
[1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:07.920]  they said we are going to ram this down your throat we are going to disrupt networks of
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:11.280]  conservatives we're going to shut down their operations we're going to shut down fox news
[1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:14.480]  we're going to shut down newsmax we're going to shut down oem we're going to shut down tiger
[1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:21.040]  carlsson they're not even mincing words about this now they're not even they're not even playing
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:28.400]  games they're not even joking about it in any way and so there's no amount of of alarmist
[1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:33.600]  activity that could be enough here we need leaders like josh holly and cruz you notice they're
[1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:36.800]  targeting and trying to expel from the senate right now to come right out and call it for what
[1:44:36.800 --> 1:44:41.840]  it is until america we're in a total crisis that's why they cut trump off and cut off all of his
[1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:46.880]  communication systems because they feared him actually calling the public out for real against
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:50.320]  this which of course he never planned to do and didn't do they were trying to trick him into doing
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:56.320]  that and as barns exposed so i want barns to talk about solutions forward not just supporting local
[1:44:56.320 --> 1:45:00.480]  media not just keeping us on the air that's important but what congress should do legally
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:04.880]  and often what states should do i think a new declaration of independence a coalition of states
[1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:09.680]  allied with good people in congress to show the authority of real government not a literal physical
[1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:15.680]  succession but a declaration of succession a reconstituting of the republic we need to really
[1:45:15.680 --> 1:45:21.120]  have major shows around table discussions and make this the main talking point you know i've
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:25.280]  engaged in a lot of leadership before i've studied history and i'm telling you this is what we must
[1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:29.360]  do this is how we need to take action right now so i'm gonna hand this back over to robert barns
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:35.680]  and i'll be listing very intently thank you all right so you just heard from alex there uh robert
[1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:43.200]  and and you know maybe this could be spearheaded out of mar-a-lago florida where president trump
[1:45:43.200 --> 1:45:48.240]  just uh you know declared he's gonna have his office his former president office but it's the
[1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:54.080]  real president's office uh in florida so what is your take on that proposal by alex jones
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:59.840]  yeah i mean a second declaration of independence to restore and renew the first declaration of
[1:45:59.840 --> 1:46:04.320]  independence is definitely needed in an era in which they have effectively privatized
[1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:11.840]  the state so the the through monopolistic oligarchs so we face a situation in circumstance
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:18.880]  where they're using private employers big corporate employers to force uh dna changing drugs into
[1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:24.720]  people's bodies and systems for a disease that is less deadly than the flu for 80 percent or more
[1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:31.760]  of the population um the if you look at the covid's death rates it uh the average death rate is 73
[1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:37.040]  or above in europe i think it's currently at 82 it's people that on not over 90 percent of the
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:44.080]  people who die die of other comorbidities and in fact they don't know the but for causation that's
[1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:50.080]  even associated with covid because the date has been so contaminated by the perverse incentives
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:54.240]  that have been put in so the we live in an environment where they're using and then of
[1:46:54.240 --> 1:46:58.560]  course through big tech and its monopolies using its control to censor and suppress
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:03.520]  information and to manipulate information people i recognize the censorship or suppression that
[1:47:03.520 --> 1:47:08.640]  takes place many of them still under appreciate the algorithmic manipulation that's meant to
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:13.920]  deceive them into different perceptions of the way the world works and so the combination of those
[1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:19.680]  two pose unique threats to american freedom and american liberty particularly in the lockdown
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:25.280]  environment where every single constitutional liberty has been at some point suspended over the
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:31.200]  past year with courts often failing to take meaningful remedial action so the way that it
[1:47:31.200 --> 1:47:36.720]  can be actionable the solution that alex discusses the idea of a second declaration of independence
[1:47:36.720 --> 1:47:42.240]  to expand and reinforce the original purposes and premises of the first declaration of independence
[1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:49.200]  in the modern technological and corporate era to resist this sort of multi country multi corporate
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:55.680]  global elite bureaucratic style governance the great reset being discussed by the world economic
[1:47:55.680 --> 1:48:01.440]  forum the great resistance to the great reset is the restoration of the declaration of independence
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:10.880]  the it's still the case that the answer to 1984 is to orwell's 1984 is more american style 1776
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:16.400]  and the way that can be accomplished legally constitutionally is what many people are considering
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:21.680]  and in fact is already partially in process which is a convention of the states you don't have to
[1:48:21.680 --> 1:48:27.840]  depend upon congress to amend and restore the constitution the states have enough states of
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:34.320]  34 states uh or at least 35 depending on the circumstance sign on to the convention then
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:38.960]  you would have a convention that could pass constitutional amendments to clarify some
[1:48:38.960 --> 1:48:43.840]  of these things that your right to informed consent should be part of that for all medical
[1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:48.960]  treatment at all time against the government or private employment your right against political
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:54.640]  based discrimination the first amendment should be expanded to include the a right not to be
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:59.920]  fired because of your speech but also a right not to suffer any consequence from these corporate
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:05.920]  oligopolies based on your first amendment rights and so if we meaningfully expand free speech and
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:11.680]  free press and we meaningfully ensure informed consent as explicitly and expressly within the
[1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:18.720]  constitutional guarantees then that would be that would take us a long way towards restoring
[1:49:18.720 --> 1:49:23.040]  the purpose and premise of the first declaration of independence so that we can have a second
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:29.280]  declaration of independence from the great reset itself and so that that's what i'm saying too is
[1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:35.200]  we have to do a reversal on the great reset that they want to bring in a world government
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:40.880]  and we have to say no we'll have a great reset of america we'll have a great reset of the constitution
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:46.480]  the bill of rights the declaration of independence yeah indeed a restoration of the republic in a
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:52.960]  meaningful way that restores the constitutional liberties it was founded upon and to reinforce
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:50:00.720]  that across the board and maybe look at not giving for maybe requiring a state consenting the same
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:07.040]  requirements that exist for amending the constitution may need to be added for any changes in the
[1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:13.680]  number of justices on the u.s supreme court for any addition of states that the states
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:18.400]  should have to consent to that separately and independently a right of recall there should
[1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:23.760]  be a right of recall against members of congress and particularly united states senators that would
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:28.640]  allow them right now what happens if somebody gets elected to the senate they're there for six years
[1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:33.200]  and they can ignore the people who represented them because they're looking at their reputation
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:37.040]  amongst the a different group of people when they get out other than the voters are supposed to be
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:42.640]  representing and the financial rewards that can come from other people and so you have mitch mcconnell
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:48.240]  betraying his base that if there was a right of recall mitch mcconnell would get recalled tomorrow
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:53.680]  and mitch mcconnell would be out of power and so we over the last 200 years but particularly in the
[1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:58.880]  last 20 we've seen certain weaknesses and vulnerabilities in our constitutional liberties
[1:50:58.880 --> 1:51:03.760]  that need expansion and express an explicit protection that a convention of states could
[1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:09.600]  possibly afford and provide and so it's definitely something to look at as well as people using more
[1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:14.320]  power of recall look at the power of recall in california just the fact they've already gathered
[1:51:14.320 --> 1:51:20.000]  1.2 million signatures has led the governor to suddenly capitulate and change his position on
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:24.320]  lockdowns well i'm not sure that has to do with that or biden getting in but i but i think there
[1:51:24.320 --> 1:51:29.680]  needs to be certainly something that has more teeth to it with these recall petitions because
[1:51:29.680 --> 1:51:33.600]  most of it just ends up being ceremonious in fact i like a hundred percent of it really is
[1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:38.320]  ceremonious there needs to be more teeth to it but you know here here's the challenge to me bob
[1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:44.240]  bob because i completely agree i mean we could write another declaration of independence for
[1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:51.360]  the year 2021 the question then becomes is what is for lack of a better term the common enemy
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:56.560]  to the american way of life the common enemy to to america in general at the time it was obvious
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:52:01.200]  it was king george it was the red coats i mean that there was no debate there even the people
[1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:05.040]  that may have liked them it was still no debate that was the case so i mean what does the new
[1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:10.000]  declaration of independence target is it big tech is it big media i mean what do we declare we're
[1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:15.440]  independent of big medical world government because i mean the democrats are admitting it i got the
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:20.800]  story here in the new york times why is big tech policing speech because the government isn't so
[1:52:20.800 --> 1:52:24.560]  they're admitting we're bringing in a corporate government we're bringing in a world government
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:30.240]  with the big tech companies that no so i mean is that who do we declare our independence from how
[1:52:30.240 --> 1:52:36.640]  do we how do we write a new declaration of independence if that's the case to label the people
[1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:42.400]  that are enemies of free speech the second amendment and so on well really it's the corporate state
[1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:48.640]  it's the merger of big corporations and the government at a status level it's much closer to
[1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:53.920]  fascism than communism is our great enemy and adversary because that's what fascism did
[1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:59.280]  it required the corporations to be subservient to the state and used corporate power to influence
[1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:04.720]  and implement their agenda and so we need to do the same thing with a restoration of rights
[1:53:04.720 --> 1:53:11.280]  and an expansion and explicit for example included in a new con in a amended constitution
[1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:17.040]  that there is no emergency exception to it that that's one of the critical components of it because
[1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:20.640]  that's where the state has used lockdown let's let's let's let's let's let's let you hone in on
[1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:25.120]  that again in this short segment coming up after the short break this is the alex joneshow on
[1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:32.000]  destroyer bob box with you mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex
[1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:36.000]  man i'm just working as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:41.760]  i love you man i want to uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it
[1:53:41.760 --> 1:53:46.400]  quite a while and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that
[1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:53.200]  it contains corsets in which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited
[1:53:53.200 --> 1:54:00.960]  it is an ion of four similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cell so
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:07.040]  people might want to take a look at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:11.920]  these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the
[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:15.520]  doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:20.720]  only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and
[1:54:20.720 --> 1:54:23.280]  that's what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug
[1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:36.000]  the globalists are taking control of the entire human genome they are forcing mutations this is
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:41.600]  forced evolution or de-evolution when you look at all the major research all the major programs
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:46.560]  are carrying out they are not to produce people that are smarter or folks that live longer or
[1:54:46.560 --> 1:54:52.720]  or more oral no it's turning humanity into a commodity now we see some propaganda like communist
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:58.800]  china bragging hey we've done m r and a vaccines to make our soldiers superman that's a way to
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:04.320]  make it sexy that hey we're experimenting on our troops we'll stand things with that into our troops
[1:55:04.320 --> 1:55:09.360]  and thousands and thousands of died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine i've talked
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:13.680]  to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of texas health department they say
[1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:18.320]  alex you know it hurts a lot of people that's for a greater good but that's not even true
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:23.520]  and it violates the Geneva convention the nirnberg code federal state law this is violence being
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:28.160]  carried out against us by that of the charity and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:44.560]  you're listening to the alex joneshow
[1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:49.600]  we've got robert barnes with us here on the alex joneshow oren shroyer sitting in the captain's
[1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:55.840]  chair today i want to give bob this segment to try to hone in on what he was getting into
[1:55:55.840 --> 1:56:00.320]  before the break cut him off when you have the democrats and the liberal media saying
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:06.320]  promoting praising big tech censoring free speech uh that's just one of the signs one of the
[1:56:06.320 --> 1:56:10.320]  symptoms that they're turning over the government to a corporate government a big tech tyranny
[1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:19.200]  medical tyranny and so we now have to me bob the shall i say landscape to say okay if we're
[1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:23.840]  going to do a new declaration of independence it's against big tech tyranny it's against medical
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:29.520]  tyranny it's uh somehow getting businesses the right to say look a government can't just come
[1:56:29.520 --> 1:56:34.480]  in here and run your business that's that's communism so how would something like this go
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:39.760]  how would a presentation of this go and an execution of this go to say look we're declaring
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:45.280]  independence from big tech big media corporate government medical tyranny we're we're declaring
[1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:51.680]  independence from this it would be to institutionalize the remedies with constitution with amending
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:57.600]  the constitution to provide expanded and express particular protections for individual liberty
[1:56:57.600 --> 1:57:01.200]  because it's really all about the individual against the corporate state that whether you're
[1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:05.280]  talking about big pharma you're talking about big media you're talking about big tech you're
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:09.520]  talking about big business you're talking about global corporations you're talking about the
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:16.720]  state itself it's the it's sort of the hydra hybrid of big corporate power and state power that is
[1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:22.480]  the great threat to individual liberty and we need to institutionalize protections through
[1:57:23.200 --> 1:57:28.000]  amending the constitution potentially as well as you can do this at every state law so to the
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:33.360]  degree that we can't get a convention of states to have a new federal constitution each individual
[1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:38.000]  state can be passing laws each individual city can be passing laws each individual county can
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:44.960]  be passing laws that expand informed consent for example that expand that in what is informed consent
[1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:49.760]  means it means they cannot invade your body with any medic compelled or coerced medical procedure
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:57.040]  without your informed consent your knowledgeable involvement and so that's just one aspect the
[1:57:57.040 --> 1:58:02.400]  second is protecting free speech from any degree of censorship whether it's by big tech oligarchic
[1:58:02.400 --> 1:58:08.080]  monopolist or by the state directly the state should not be able to achieve indirectly what it
[1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:13.760]  cannot currently do constitutionally directly the so you can provide a bunch of expanded extended
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:19.120]  protections to say no more emergency exception to the constitution and to the degree that that
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:23.520]  cannot be done or is not achievable at this juncture through a convention of the states for
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:28.480]  the federal constitution there's no reason why it can't be included within state constitutions
[1:58:28.480 --> 1:58:32.960]  why it can't be included within county charters why it can't be included within city governments
[1:58:32.960 --> 1:58:39.120]  you know you look at every potential locale for remedy look at what the left did the left weaponized
[1:58:39.120 --> 1:58:44.640]  its local access its access to local power to create sanctuary cities over the last four years
[1:58:44.640 --> 1:58:50.480]  that discarded state and federal law and did so with impunity and immunity well learn from that
[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:56.080]  and restore constitutional rights and remedies at that level so there's multiple levels of government
[1:58:56.080 --> 1:59:01.040]  by which we can achieve and attain some of these benefits and at least put into motion the goal
[1:59:01.040 --> 1:59:07.680]  of having it ultimately be a national protection and then last but not least in the institutional
[1:59:07.680 --> 1:59:13.920]  components would be looking at how what are the risks the risks are the ability to pack the court
[1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:18.880]  the risk are the ability uh the to stack the senate the risks are the senators who don't
[1:59:18.880 --> 1:59:24.160]  have to listen to their constituents because of the length of their terms so with the the risk
[1:59:24.160 --> 1:59:29.360]  is not being able to have term limits currently under the court's jurisprudence those institutional
[1:59:29.360 --> 1:59:36.800]  reforms can go back in in the same way our bicameral legislatures and our tri-cameral method
[1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:41.440]  of government was meant to do the checks and balances that were supposed to be there that
[1:59:41.440 --> 1:59:47.280]  right now are failing and that our courts are failing and ways you can reform that include
[1:59:47.280 --> 1:59:52.240]  not allowing states to be added without two-thirds of the states agreeing not allowing additional
[1:59:52.240 --> 1:59:57.680]  supreme court justices to be adding without amending the constitution to do so allowing a
[1:59:57.680 --> 2:00:03.200]  right of recall of house members and senators allowing the standards as you mentioned for recall
[2:00:03.200 --> 2:00:08.080]  to be more toothed to have more impact so that those are not so high and prohibitive is not to
[2:00:08.080 --> 2:00:13.280]  be able to do so and last but not least supporting places like info wars that allows this information
[2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:18.480]  to be distributed free of the sensors and suppressors in the first place the the go to info wars
[2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:23.760]  store dot com buy products that make you healthier wealthier and wiser while at the same time supporting
[2:00:23.760 --> 2:00:30.480]  the revolutionary change that can happen democratically and constitutionally to restore our freedoms

[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:50.080]  you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:59.040]  you are the resistance and now your host owin shroyer when the founding fathers were battling
[2:01:59.040 --> 2:02:09.280]  tyranny in the 18th century everything was still physical and so the red coats as they were known
[2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:16.080]  at the time lobster backs a little more demeaning term when king george sent them to america they
[2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:21.280]  had to seize their physical assets they had to seize their physical firearms and they had to
[2:02:21.280 --> 2:02:29.360]  physically do it now everything uh well maybe not everything but most activity is done digitally
[2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:34.560]  and so it can be done in the shadows it can be done in secrecy and it's harder for the people to
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:43.280]  comprehend or perceive what's going on and it just moves so fast and so it was easy back then
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:46.560]  to say no look we're going to be declaring independence against the people that are literally
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:53.680]  coming to our front doors monitoring our communities taking our guns taking our assets
[2:02:53.680 --> 2:02:57.520]  well now that it's all digital it's a little more cloudy it's a little more confused and this
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:03:01.600]  this is a new phenomenon that that we're dealing with here as humans the new digital world we're
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:08.880]  really not even uh half a century into this and so it does create a complex situation
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:13.920]  to declare independence from these things that are really mostly in the shadows and and just in
[2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:18.080]  algorithms but you know uh robert barnes is doing one more segment with us here
[2:03:19.200 --> 2:03:28.320]  bob i would make the argument that the tyranny we're dealing with now from big tech big pharma
[2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:37.440]  is uh they're actually more powerful than the british empire was in the 18th century i mean
[2:03:37.440 --> 2:03:42.960]  they really have more power over the world the google's uh big pharma and the rest of them
[2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:49.760]  than the british empire could ever even imagine and so you'd think that it would be easy to ally
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:53.680]  against this force you think it would be easy to get people to understand these issues but again i
[2:03:53.680 --> 2:03:58.640]  think it's the phenomenon of the digital world it's the distractions that we all have and it's
[2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:03.680]  the conformity issue that we're dealing with as well that makes it so difficult so i mean how
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:08.960]  how do you think whether it's president trump or info wars or somebody else steps up as a leader here
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:16.080]  how do we present this as being beneficial to all americans uh since you know trump ourselves
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:20.320]  and others have been so so demonized lied about over the years how do you present something like
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:25.680]  this to get the whole uh american body politic to understand no this is something that's good for
[2:04:25.680 --> 2:04:31.680]  all of us this is something that's a necessity if we want to have a free country again uh and and
[2:04:31.680 --> 2:04:38.800]  getting the clap trap of oh racism oh this oh that uh but actually hitting the issue of no this is
[2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:47.440]  independence against a orwellian type controlled technotronic big corporate government world
[2:04:47.440 --> 2:04:53.600]  government state that we're heading into i think a couple things i mean one is the office of the
[2:04:54.320 --> 2:05:00.480]  former president that the president has opened up can take a major role by blessing certain
[2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:07.440]  think tanks by blessing certain packs by being involved himself and helping give direction
[2:05:07.440 --> 2:05:13.040]  to his movement and the people that support populism across the country and support him
[2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:18.720]  and so he's already done so in a certain respect of showing his potential leverage by saying well
[2:05:18.720 --> 2:05:23.440]  maybe i'll start a third party if they really do the kind of things they're talking about against my
[2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:30.640]  constituents uh and my supporters including almost 75 million voters in the last presidential
[2:05:30.640 --> 2:05:37.040]  election and the and we saw a poll yesterday published by just the news uh john solomon's
[2:05:37.040 --> 2:05:43.840]  organization which showed that most republicans would vote for donald trump's third party over
[2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:49.120]  the republican party nominee in 2024 regardless of who that nominee is for the patriot party
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:55.120]  uh so what that is is that's power that's leverage uh and he's he understands that i
[2:05:55.120 --> 2:05:59.440]  represented ralph nadir back in the day because nadir understood that he understood that the
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:04.960]  end of the threat of third party leverage gives you the ability and the capacity to influence
[2:06:04.960 --> 2:06:10.000]  an election and to influence politicians and to influence the press even without ever launching
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:15.760]  such a third party as needed or necessary the but he could also there needs to be an intellectual
[2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:21.600]  infrastructure of the kind that you're talking about to help and it needs to be the technological
[2:06:21.600 --> 2:06:25.840]  means to spread that intellectual infrastructure but one way the president can take a direct
[2:06:25.840 --> 2:06:30.640]  role is by blessing some of these particular projects uh blessing and an election integrity
[2:06:30.640 --> 2:06:35.200]  project uh blessing i'm working on that with matt brainard who's doing his thing and i'm
[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:40.400]  going to be working on it with richard barris of people's pundit there's ways to have institutional
[2:06:40.400 --> 2:06:46.560]  election law reform so that what happened in 2020 does not happen again uh there's our there are
[2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:53.200]  freedom supporting majorities in most states uh in the in the state legislatures and enough
[2:06:53.200 --> 2:06:58.000]  governors to get support and where there isn't that's where initiatives and referendums can
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:03.760]  be put on the ballot because these proposals are extraordinarily popular we can reform the way our
[2:07:03.760 --> 2:07:09.760]  elections done so that we can restore confidence in our election process and and reinforce the power
[2:07:09.760 --> 2:07:16.000]  of the franchise give back the power power of the ballot to the person not to the tech companies not
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:22.480]  to the politicians that may corruptly apply it so that's but that's one of the things the president
[2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:28.400]  can do he could bless the recall campaign against governor newson to help support that uh because
[2:07:28.400 --> 2:07:33.200]  even if the recall effort isn't ultimately successful uh just the fact that it's even
[2:07:33.200 --> 2:07:37.920]  going to be potentially on the ballot is scaring governors and mayors and politicians all across
[2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:43.760]  the country into reconsidering their aggressive actions if you can recall the california governor
[2:07:43.760 --> 2:07:50.160]  and the most uh left-leaning state in the nation then imagine what you can do in any other jurisdiction
[2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:55.040]  so that is a place where end of the president's office of the former president uh or trump's
[2:07:55.040 --> 2:08:03.040]  offices can utilize his his his reputational his his brand his audience he can uh effectively
[2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:08.800]  weaponize that to favor those kind of reforms institutionally and individually he can of
[2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:15.200]  course also uh get involved in supporting primary challengers providing means of third party ballot
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:21.680]  access uh in order to be able to increase his authority and authenticity uh and in his power
[2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:27.360]  and changing who gets elected where he can do so through packs he could do so through helping
[2:08:27.360 --> 2:08:32.160]  with fundraising he can do so through bringing attention to such candidates and causes that
[2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:38.400]  might currently be on the outs uh he can also continue to use his brand as potentially creating
[2:08:38.400 --> 2:08:43.840]  independent banks independent technology independent media operations you know the he
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:49.440]  doesn't have to have trump tv necessarily but he could bless particular media outlets by participating
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:54.400]  in promoting them in ways that go outside the institutional narrative to promote to bring
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:08:59.680]  in more people to independent sources of media exposure he could do the same thing with financial
[2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:04.080]  institutions he could create relationships with those banks that are willing to be politically
[2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:08.640]  non-discriminatory to give those banks a competitive financial edge in the marketplace
[2:09:08.640 --> 2:09:13.520]  because of his blessing of them and their co-committed uh committed role to not politically
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:18.480]  discriminating he can go further than that by blessing or creating independent technology
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:24.960]  platforms uh whether it's gab uh whether it's telegram whether it's uh locals uh you know i
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:30.160]  created a site on locals which dav rubin created as a backup to be completely independent of big
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:37.040]  tech censorship and suppression and control and it's a viva barnslaw.locals.com that's a
[2:09:37.040 --> 2:09:43.200]  perfect example to declare ourselves independent from apple or google because they are the ones that
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:49.440]  aren't aren't allowing a a new tech platform to to blossom because they ban them off their app i mean
[2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:54.000]  that's like you know controlling all the railways and you know thinking about this too and listening
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:57.520]  to you talk you know and i i always said this i never heard anybody else make this comparison
[2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:02.400]  but it seems actually more applicable now you know i always viewed donald trump as a john
[2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:09.840]  handcock type uh i mean john handcock was never really a revolutionary figure uh at the time uh
[2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:16.080]  but he represented power and wealth and influence and so the reason why the declaration of independence
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:21.360]  has john handcock signature like 10 times bigger than anybody else is is because it was his power
[2:10:21.360 --> 2:10:25.120]  it was his it wasn't he was never known as revolutionary but at that time it was him
[2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:29.840]  stamping his name with all the influence and power of the ports and the wealth that he had
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:34.320]  saying no i i'm with this i'm for american independence i kind of feel trump is the same
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:40.080]  right now i mean uh trump can have somebody else i mean maybe we're we're maybe it's kind of uh
[2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:45.120]  more of a um you know exhibition but you know he could have somebody do a declaration of
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:49.760]  independence like ted cruz or josh holly to have it worded right and then he just signed
[2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:54.320]  his name bigger than everybody else is like no this is my stamp of approval this is my influence
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:11:00.160]  on this and and i'm with the people yeah donald trump could definitely give his john handcock
[2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:05.200]  to meaningful institutional reforms and the new intellectual and technological infrastructure
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:09.920]  necessary to make those reforms realistic he you could create not only trump tv but why not
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:15.360]  create uh trump apps uh trump uh phone trump it i mean how about a name like trumpet for any a
[2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:21.600]  trumpet for a phone for uh for a you know social media app bob barnes always excellent work thank

[2:17:52.640 --> 2:18:00.000]  so it's odd another pedophile that is against america and against trump isn't that something
[2:18:01.040 --> 2:18:06.640]  every time you swing a stick around the anti trump activists the militant ones
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:13.440]  you're gonna hit a pedophile i mean i mean what are the odds with call written house
[2:18:14.320 --> 2:18:22.880]  and the rest of them and now this guy so very odd stuff happening there but isn't it funny
[2:18:23.920 --> 2:18:30.800]  well you know the story hundreds of democrat riots in the summer of 2020 they said it was peaceful
[2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:40.080]  uh one riot at the capital on january 6th and it's all hell breaks loose
[2:18:42.160 --> 2:18:45.200]  democrat party in organ blames republicans
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:56.320]  for latest attacks on its headquarters by antifa i mean this is some serious switcheroo here
[2:18:56.320 --> 2:19:01.040]  the democrat party of organ releasing a statement blaming republicans
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:11.200]  and saying it quote was a republican attack on their headquarters it's literally antifa
[2:19:11.200 --> 2:19:18.720]  dressed in black block putting up all the antifa um monikers and all the antifa
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:26.080]  you know phrasing and a cab and everything and so then they say oh it's republicans i mean it's
[2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:33.680]  it's literally on antifa on video putting up the antifa propaganda and then the democrats say oh
[2:19:33.680 --> 2:19:40.160]  it's republicans i mean again do you need any more proof the democrats literally can't even
[2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:44.640]  tell the truth i'm beginning to wonder if a democrat has some sort of disorder where they
[2:19:44.640 --> 2:19:51.200]  are unable to speak truth and and they just can't stop lying because it doesn't matter that all the
[2:19:51.200 --> 2:19:56.720]  evidence it's against every claim they ever make they just go ahead and make the lie anyway so pretty
[2:19:56.720 --> 2:20:02.400]  unbelievable there but yeah i mean that's republicans that's what they're known for going out in black
[2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:06.880]  block and covering their faces and smashing uh democrat headquarters yep and writing a cab
[2:20:06.880 --> 2:20:12.800]  and f police and all that oh yeah that's republican behavior all right i mean who believes that and
[2:20:12.800 --> 2:20:17.520]  see that's what i'm saying who believes joe biden actually won i don't know nobody everybody knows
[2:20:17.520 --> 2:20:24.640]  he cheated see here's the problem the democrat party i allied with the chinese communists working
[2:20:24.640 --> 2:20:27.760]  for globalism where the chinese communists are in control of the corporate world government
[2:20:28.960 --> 2:20:31.440]  because they have the biggest population so they have the biggest leverage
[2:20:33.520 --> 2:20:38.560]  see they know they're severely unpopular they know they don't have we the people behind them
[2:20:38.560 --> 2:20:44.000]  the thing is the rub is they know they have all hollywood they know they have all the media they
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:50.240]  know they have all the big tech and so they can come out and just lie and lie and lie and deceive
[2:20:50.240 --> 2:20:55.840]  and deceive and deceive knowing that they're gonna have the echo chamber of all the media the echo
[2:20:55.840 --> 2:21:04.240]  chamber of hollywood to present like oh this is the reality this is the public perception this is
[2:21:06.080 --> 2:21:10.720]  this is what people are saying and thinking when no it's just everything that is in control by the
[2:21:10.720 --> 2:21:17.280]  globalist by the communist chinese so that's hollywood the democrat party and mainstream news
[2:21:18.800 --> 2:21:26.400]  so they they they inflate themselves as being big and popular when really they're not here's another
[2:21:26.400 --> 2:21:34.560]  example conservatives beliefs conservative beliefs trump support not performance are keeping
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:45.760]  curt chilling from hooper's town so this is a obviously if you know who curt chilling is
[2:21:45.760 --> 2:21:50.720]  major league ballplayer famous pitcher a lot of famous moments two world series champions
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:57.440]  believe he won a few si young awards and he's not being voted into the hall of fame why because
[2:21:57.440 --> 2:22:02.400]  he's publicly supporting donald trump now i gotta be honest this actually surprises me
[2:22:02.400 --> 2:22:07.760]  me i've worked in sports media i've rubbed elbows with hundreds of people that vote for
[2:22:07.760 --> 2:22:11.920]  the hall of fame i've worked for people that vote for the whole thing uh most of them are actually
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:17.280]  conservative so i'm wondering where this pressure is coming from to be quite frank but curt chilling
[2:22:17.280 --> 2:22:22.480]  has been blackballed uh from many things he used to work at espn he used to do all kind of stuff
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:27.360]  they blackballed him from all that why because he supports trump but he powered through anyway so for

[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:37.200]  percent organic coffee only available at info wars store dot com you're listening to the alex
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:57.440]  jones show waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[2:26:00.640 --> 2:26:05.360]  what we are witnessing is a systematic corporate private world government whose in game is the
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:11.200]  very control over human genetics now that's out in the open now we've left beta we're now into
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:15.520]  operational there's an excellent report by tugger carlson and info wars dot com you should see the
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:19.040]  whole report you should share it if you didn't see it last night even if you did see it did you
[2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:25.680]  share it tugger carlson democrats preparing to enshrine fraud into law so they can stay in power
[2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:31.040]  and it's hr1 that allows all the fraud you saw in the last election to be codified into law
[2:26:31.040 --> 2:26:35.760]  and lets the federal government run elections violating the constitution and they even stay
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:42.800]  in the actual bill they say contrary to the constitution i'm not kidding it's the federal
[2:26:42.800 --> 2:26:47.440]  government that runs elections not the states so you just heard that fox news host tucker carlson
[2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:51.600]  spelled out stark terms on his monday night monologue that what is the store for america
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:55.840]  with joe biden now in the winows carlson warned that democrats are already putting forth proposal
[2:26:55.840 --> 2:27:01.440]  called hr1 to cement all the mechanisms to contribute the 2020 election frauded law the
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:05.600]  for the people act is the foundation of democratic party strategy to control the federal government
[2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:10.320]  well into your grandchildren's middle age take a closer look at it carlson warned he says like
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:15.520]  most revolutionary documents it's not very exciting read nothing sounds especially radical at first
[2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:21.040]  the bill begins by declaring that contrary to article one of the united states constitution
[2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:26.640]  congress has an ultimate supervisory power over federal elections but it first goes to the states
[2:27:26.640 --> 2:27:31.120]  they're saying no they're cut out under our current law states get to decide how much fraud
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:35.520]  they will tolerate flora requires you to show photo identification or to vote california
[2:27:35.520 --> 2:27:40.320]  just want you to vote democrat continued so again this overrides all the states to totally
[2:27:40.320 --> 2:27:44.000]  criminal they know we're exposing this fraud state level they know trumps begging that is number one
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:48.640]  agenda with his now office of former president and so they're trying to head us off with the past
[2:27:48.640 --> 2:27:55.040]  medical tyranny financial tyranny censorship tyranny surveillance tyranny but the good news is
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:27:58.960]  people are turning against it there's a major awakening and they're having to suspend a lot
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:02.880]  of the vaccine program because it's killing so many people and so these guys have been off more
[2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:07.040]  than they can chew we had them in a corner say launched a full-scale counterattack they stole
[2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:12.880]  the election from trump but nobody's buying biden so don't be down folks and trust in god trust the
[2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:17.680]  plan of god don't trust the plan of men and just do what's right you know the god will do the rest
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:22.000]  of it here's part of that report and then back to oan shroyer again for myself the whole info wars
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:26.640]  crew we're very honored to still be on air at this time the enemy's moving to take down telegram
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:30.000]  they've taken down parlor they're trying to take down gab they're trying to take down info wars

[2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:40.480]  like it's our last because we have the truth and that's hurting the globalist so please remember
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:44.720]  we're now in ultra critical mode and you are part of this you're at the tip of the spear with us so
[2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:48.400]  so just spread everything and let folks know this is the forbidden information you're not
[2:28:48.400 --> 2:28:52.160]  supposed to have this is what the globalist don't want you to have but people are ready for that
[2:28:52.160 --> 2:28:57.040]  truth let them know tell them this is the great reset this is the takeover this is an attack on
[2:28:57.040 --> 2:29:01.200]  you you need to know what's happening and you can defeat it and we will find the people that care
[2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:05.280]  and they will take action we will win together but regardless thanks for keeping info wars it's
[2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:08.960]  really kind of the mother ship of the resistance on the air think of where we'd all be in force
[2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:14.960]  wasn't here that's why salute you and thank you all here's Dr. Carlson by the way now there's amazon
[2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:20.480]  dot com it's a real company jeff bezos who owns it is strongly for mail-in voting when mail-in voting
[2:29:20.480 --> 2:29:25.600]  allows his parties to take control of everything you're a bigot if you oppose that but when it
[2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:30.320]  comes to union elections in his own company elections that might require jeff bezos to pay
[2:29:30.320 --> 2:29:36.480]  his long-suffering workers decent wages and benefits jeff bezos is totally opposed to it amazon
[2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:41.920]  is fighting mail-in balloting in its union election in alabama right now amazon.com's position
[2:29:41.920 --> 2:29:47.520]  is that an election decided by mail-in ballots wouldn't be and we're quoting valid or fair
[2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:53.920]  huh when it's their power at stake democrats have a totally different position that's true in
[2:29:53.920 --> 2:29:58.960]  california right now you may have heard there is a recall effort underway in that state voters
[2:29:58.960 --> 2:30:04.080]  are trying to boot their comically incompetent governor Gavin Newsom more than a million people
[2:30:04.080 --> 2:30:08.720]  have signed on so far to that effort but it's not so easy to get it done because democrats
[2:30:08.720 --> 2:30:14.320]  are requiring in-person signatures for those petitions suddenly they're very worried about
[2:30:14.320 --> 2:30:20.720]  voter fraud you should know this is not hypocrisy republicans often call it hypocrisy but it's not
[2:30:20.720 --> 2:30:25.280]  it's far more profound than that democrats don't care about hypocrisy they don't mind if they're
[2:30:25.280 --> 2:30:31.120]  caught breaking their own rules they're not offended by double standards they want power
[2:30:31.120 --> 2:30:36.000]  this is a power grab that's all it is and you're complaining about it means nothing to them
[2:30:36.960 --> 2:30:40.560]  if you needed more evidence of that as if you needed more evidence consider new legislation
[2:30:40.560 --> 2:30:45.600]  from congresswoman Stephanie murphy she's a democrat from orlando murphy has proposed a bill
[2:30:45.600 --> 2:30:49.840]  that would ban anyone with the wrong opinions from having a significant job in the federal
[2:30:49.840 --> 2:30:54.880]  government believe forbidden things and you don't get a security clearance you can't work here
[2:30:55.680 --> 2:31:00.720]  murphy's bill would require federal investigators to ask all applicants whether they had quote
[2:31:00.720 --> 2:31:06.800]  associated with or knowingly engaged in activities conducted by an organization or movement that
[2:31:06.800 --> 2:31:12.400]  spreads conspiracy theories and false information about the united states government end quote
[2:31:13.520 --> 2:31:18.320]  wait a second conspiracy theories and false information about the united states government
[2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:25.200]  whoa it sounds like these people could be in trouble you can see evidence in plain sight
[2:31:25.200 --> 2:31:29.680]  on the issue of collusion so there's clear evidence on the issue of collusion and this adds
[2:31:29.680 --> 2:31:33.840]  to that body of evidence and there is significant evidence of collusion there is ample evidence
[2:31:33.840 --> 2:31:39.280]  and indeed there is of collusion of people in the trump campaign with the russians i think there's
[2:31:39.280 --> 2:31:44.480]  plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy all of this is evidence of collusion there is
[2:31:44.480 --> 2:31:51.120]  significant evidence much of it in the public domain on the issue of collusion just kidding
[2:31:51.120 --> 2:31:58.240]  the people who spent years peddling ludicrous conspiracy theories disproven factually theories
[2:31:58.240 --> 2:32:02.320]  that vladimir putin secretly controlled the federal government those people will be fine
[2:32:02.320 --> 2:32:05.840]  because at this point that would include pretty much everyone currently in power
[2:32:05.840 --> 2:32:10.880]  yes they were knee-deep in conspiracy theories that actually hurt our country in measurable ways
[2:32:10.880 --> 2:32:16.720]  but this legislation isn't designed to punish them just the opposite this legislation is designed
[2:32:16.720 --> 2:32:22.800]  to protect them from your criticism under stephanie murphy's bill anyone who criticizes
[2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:29.120]  stephanie murphy could be punished oh makes sense now now you think all this might raise some eyebrows
[2:32:29.120 --> 2:32:33.760]  among traditional civil liberties people civil liberties folks as they call themselves come on
[2:32:33.760 --> 2:32:41.200]  now it's 2021 the media love laws like this laws like this are aimed directly at the media's sworn
[2:32:41.200 --> 2:32:47.760]  archenemies people who went to state schools and other undesirables listen as the geniuses explain
[2:32:47.760 --> 2:32:52.480]  how the single biggest threat to this country isn't chinese hegemony or even the coming hyper
[2:32:52.480 --> 2:32:56.960]  inflation pretty much a certainty now which was a hundred percent caused by elite mismanagement
[2:32:56.960 --> 2:33:02.800]  of our economy but no let's not talk about that the real threat is a forbidden idea it's something
[2:33:02.800 --> 2:33:10.400]  called qanon next what to do about qanon and its droves of loyal followers is it too little too
[2:33:10.400 --> 2:33:15.440]  late to bring our loved ones back to reality many of those who believe the totally unfounded
[2:33:15.440 --> 2:33:22.000]  conspiracies and prophecies of qanon expected january 20th to be judgment day as far right
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:27.280]  figures and qanon conspiracy theories are joined by trump supporters who believe the election was
[2:33:27.280 --> 2:33:32.800]  stolen qanon is better viewed as an on ramp to various different extremism circles how many
[2:33:32.800 --> 2:33:40.000]  people in the country have been marinated uh in these conspiracy theories qanon craziness uh and it
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:46.960]  is frightening oh mr tom freedman thinks this is all pretty frightening and he's right but not as
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:52.880]  usual for the reasons he thinks we're watching a profound change taking place in american society
[2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:59.040]  that's happening very fast the stakes could not be higher there's a clear line between democracy
[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:05.440]  and tyranny between self-government and dictatorship and here's what that line is that line is your
[2:34:05.440 --> 2:34:11.440]  conscience they cannot cross that government has every right to tell you what to do controlling the

[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:46.960]  reputation precedes her a dirty cop a political hooker who sucked and slept her way to the top
[2:40:46.960 --> 2:40:51.760]  that's well known that's not rhetoric everybody knows that I'm sorry if that's hurt your feelings
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:40:56.480]  but that's just the truth but she's now being built up by the Los Angeles Times and they're
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:41:00.720]  going to be following her and they're basically admitting she's going to replace Joe Biden probably
[2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:07.280]  within a year or two the first vice president who is black south asian female and the direct
[2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:13.840]  descendants of immigrants oh my gosh introducing covering Kamala Harris a beat dedicated to her
[2:41:13.840 --> 2:41:20.080]  historic rise to the white house do you think they'll be covering all the uh she gave willy brown
[2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:24.560]  do you think they'll be covering the oh that she gave willy brown
[2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:35.920]  you know pretty funny isn't it the fake laugh of hers I mean what a disingenuous political
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:44.000]  whore she is moving on this is interesting interesting development here from the daily caller
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:48.640]  Christopher steel defended good friend Ivanka trump fbi note show
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:55.280]  hmm steel defended Ivanka in an interview with the fbi in september of 2017
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:42:11.040]  huh very interesting very interesting indeed Ivanka hmm Jared Kushner hmm that's an interesting one
[2:42:11.040 --> 2:42:21.440]  there great article by drew allen and I wish I had more time to delve into this the cult of climate
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:26.880]  change the most illegitimate issue in the history of mankind and the most existential threat to
[2:42:26.880 --> 2:42:34.960]  american freedom and prosperity there's so many great excerpts in here uh that I'd love to just
[2:42:34.960 --> 2:42:43.520]  read but you know some of the best stuff is he highlights some of the claims that have been
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:52.800]  made by the global warming man made climate change activists literally zero percent accurate there is
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:43:01.760]  not a single claim not a single claim not a one not one single claim that a man made climate change
[2:43:01.760 --> 2:43:06.400]  global warming used to be global cooling whatever they have whatever the flavor of the year is
[2:43:06.400 --> 2:43:13.760]  there's not a single claim ever not one that you can find that has ever turned out to be accurate
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:19.760]  and of course the latest would have to be there 500 days to avoid climate chaos remember that at
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:26.080]  the start of the trump presidency 500 days 500 days to avoid the total calamity of the climate
[2:43:26.720 --> 2:43:34.720]  well let me tell you i'm here in austin texas and it is a beautiful day so uh climate chaos
[2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:41.840]  never happened melting of the ice caps never happened uh total they used to claim new ice age
[2:43:41.840 --> 2:43:48.640]  never happened so just a great job by drew alan the cult of climate change highlighting how
[2:43:48.640 --> 2:43:54.880]  zero percent so the weathermen always wrong zero percent zero percent of predictions made
[2:43:55.440 --> 2:44:01.040]  by man made climate change activists have ever been proven accurate that's zero percent
[2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:07.920]  that is an interesting one this should be illegal nancy and paul polosi bought more than one million
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:13.440]  dollar in tesla disney and apple and of course these are the stocks that are rising and these
[2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:17.520]  are the individuals at those companies that got wealthier than ever during the fake pandemic
[2:44:18.160 --> 2:44:24.800]  should congressmen and women be allowed to purchase stock i think that's a debate maybe we need to have
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:32.960]  so president trump has set up the oval office in mara lago president donald trump
[2:44:32.960 --> 2:44:37.440]  to combat the fake president joe biden we'll see how that goes when he makes his first statement
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:42.560]  that's in the works washington examiner headline us satisfaction was higher under trump than obama
[2:44:42.560 --> 2:44:48.720]  bush best in 16 years oh i can't wait to see the numbers and returns from biden satisfaction
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:54.640]  and you know can you imagine i'd love to see this of course he never would i don't even think he
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:58.400]  has the physical energy to do it let alone the will because he knows how it would go
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:04.000]  can you imagine remember president trump used to go to sporting events national championship games
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:08.640]  navy army navy game recently at the army navy game and he shows up at the army navy game
[2:45:09.200 --> 2:45:15.280]  and i mean just raucous applause i mean just roaring applause for president trump
[2:45:15.280 --> 2:45:20.800]  i would love to see joe biden make an appearance at the army navy game next year would anybody
[2:45:20.800 --> 2:45:27.120]  else like to see that boy wouldn't that be fun to watch an entire stadium
[2:45:29.120 --> 2:45:35.600]  of our future military booing joe biden the loudest booze in human history
[2:45:36.640 --> 2:45:44.160]  boy i would love to see that i challenge joe biden to attend the army navy game 2021 i dare you joe
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:49.600]  or kamala in fact both of you in fact i predict if they did that there would be a riot breaking
[2:45:49.600 --> 2:45:54.560]  out of the stadium i'm not even kidding you'd be insane that would be something i'd love to see it
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:46:04.080]  in a very sad story you may have seen this a black woman brutally murdered her adopted white daughter
[2:46:05.600 --> 2:46:11.760]  routinely joked about child abuse and routinely did post about white privilege
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:23.200]  and she beat her daughter to death three-year-old white girl and you know
[2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:31.920]  she was also oddly enough she won a food network worst cooks in america competition
[2:46:31.920 --> 2:46:42.000]  but now she's been arrested for the death over the murder of her adopted white girl and you
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:49.520]  know it breaks my heart to wonder this but you wonder how many children out there have been
[2:46:49.520 --> 2:47:03.120]  adopted by parents just so they can abuse them hurts my heart but sadly i think it's even if
[2:47:03.120 --> 2:47:10.160]  it's one or two is far too many there's at least one example right there very sad senator ted Cruz
[2:47:10.880 --> 2:47:16.480]  and other republicans introduce reintroduce amendment imposing term limits on members of
[2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:19.760]  congress so we have someone bring that up on the phones yesterday i said hey it's already
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:24.880]  happening and we can't really spearhead it but there you go legislation is introduced human

[2:51:35.360 --> 2:51:38.640]  but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet
[2:51:38.640 --> 2:51:46.400]  they are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth to the gmo crops
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:53.040]  and now they've moved on to their main target too madly with the mRNA vaccines which are not vaccines
[2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:58.480]  they are recombinant dna from aborted cloned fetuses
[2:51:59.600 --> 2:52:06.800]  were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems go read the actual inserts
[2:52:06.800 --> 2:52:13.920]  for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned this is the equivalent of an alien
[2:52:13.920 --> 2:52:18.560]  takeover whether it's interdimensional whether it's little green men the globalists are acting
[2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:22.400]  like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us it's all the same in the end
[2:52:25.840 --> 2:52:28.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:52:28.480 --> 2:52:43.840]  from the summit.new studios in the united kingdom you are listening to paul joseph watson
[2:52:46.320 --> 2:52:52.480]  hello everyone and welcome back to the summit news hour we have a situation in europe and the
[2:52:52.480 --> 2:52:58.960]  netherlands where the new york post is now reporting that the netherlands is on the brink of civil war
[2:52:58.960 --> 2:53:06.320]  those are their words not mine as rioters strike again over covid 19 curfew we're going to get
[2:53:06.320 --> 2:53:12.000]  into that who exactly is behind the rioting in holland you've literally got people blowing up
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:19.040]  bridges in protest against this nine p.m curfew is it all what it seems probably not we're going
[2:53:19.040 --> 2:53:27.600]  to get into it and the same people who back in march in the uk said it was xenophobic to close
[2:53:27.600 --> 2:53:34.560]  the borders it was racist to close the borders to fight the spread of covid 19 and now heralding
[2:53:34.560 --> 2:53:41.280]  and citing new zealand as the model example of how to fight covid 19 yeah you know why there's no
[2:53:41.280 --> 2:53:47.520]  covid 19 in new zealand because they close their borders they close their borders right at the start
[2:53:47.520 --> 2:53:53.040]  they've still gotten closed similar situation in australia australia is now saying they're probably
[2:53:53.040 --> 2:53:59.120]  going to remain closed their borders are going to remain closed for at least another year and you've
[2:53:59.120 --> 2:54:05.120]  got all these leftists on twitter who said it was outrageous to suggest closing the borders back in
[2:54:05.120 --> 2:54:11.360]  march the world health organization came out and said that they said it was discriminatory against
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:18.400]  chinese people to have border controls to try to stop this virus new zealand does it they've got
[2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:23.200]  zero covid cases and all the liberals like why didn't we follow new zealand's example
[2:54:23.840 --> 2:54:32.240]  you were the one saying it was racist joe biden responded to donald trump's tweet last year
[2:54:33.280 --> 2:54:38.240]  when trump said that the borders needed to be closed to stop the china virus said that donald
[2:54:38.240 --> 2:54:45.440]  trump was being xenophobic now biden's done exactly that and politifact did a fact check on it and
[2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:52.240]  said oh biden biden never said that was xenophobic about trump it's literally there in black and white
[2:54:52.240 --> 2:54:58.000]  this is the problem we have with the media now all that fact checking has now disappeared
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:03.040]  because trump is out of office the washington post has come out and said it's not going to
[2:55:03.040 --> 2:55:09.520]  carry out any more fact checks they're done and dusted the most pressing hardcore questions they're
[2:55:09.520 --> 2:55:14.560]  asking the biden administration in the press conference conferences now is are you going to
[2:55:14.560 --> 2:55:21.840]  change the color scheme on the plane biden is pictured with his family not wearing a mask on
[2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:28.400]  federal property in violation of the executive order he signed hours before a fox news reporter
[2:55:28.400 --> 2:55:33.760]  asks about it and what does the press secretary say oh we got more important things to worry about
[2:55:35.040 --> 2:55:40.000]  literally they had frothing meltdowns every five minutes over trump not wearing a mask
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:47.200]  when biden violates his own executive order oh they just brush it off immediately incredible
[2:55:47.200 --> 2:55:52.800]  we're going to get into what's happening in the uk with this covid lockdown which by the way they've
[2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:58.800]  now given the councils the power to extend it until july so people saying it's going to be over
[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:05.360]  by spring maybe not we've been told by bill gates and others that it won't be over until 2022 we now
[2:56:05.360 --> 2:56:13.360]  have a pandemic economy entire industry is being planned around a future plan at pat
[2:56:13.360 --> 2:56:19.280]  pandemic fruiting slip pandemic economy that will last for years and we're going to have a report
[2:56:19.280 --> 2:56:25.760]  on that they're now repurposing robots to enforce social distancing and mask wearing and saying
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:31.280]  they're going to replace humans because humans are dangerous and we can't be around each other
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:38.480]  again this is about atomizing society to an even greater degree so we're totally disconnected from
[2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:45.120]  each other and totally dependent on these technocrats who are admittedly taking over society
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:52.800]  using covid as an opportunity in their own words an opportunity for a great reset we're going to
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:58.800]  get into that as well of course we have the start of the davos davos world economic forum the group
[2:56:58.800 --> 2:57:04.400]  behind the great reset the group behind these vaccine passports that governments promised us
[2:57:04.400 --> 2:57:09.680]  would never come to fruition now they're being rolled out on a daily basis we're also going to
[2:57:09.680 --> 2:57:15.120]  talk about what's happening in terms of america in terms of this growing unrest in terms of the
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:21.120]  occupation of dc and we're going to talk about how now they're going after telegram they're now
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:26.800]  saying because some people said some violent things on telegram that that needs to be banned too
[2:57:30.720 --> 2:57:35.840]  three two one here we go it's back in stock it's been sold out for over eight months we couldn't
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:40.000]  get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock let me tell you real quick about it but
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  the power of quail egg concentrate pollen block acts differently the traditional antihistamines
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:47.920]  that was clinically studied alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear signage
[2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:53.120]  passages and eating respiratory function it's amazing folks absolutely love it and again

[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:14.480]  unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and
[2:58:14.480 --> 2:58:19.200]  gives you a headache this is naturally occurring it's the secret of how the quail don't have the
[2:58:19.200 --> 2:58:24.880]  seasonal distress and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us you chew up the pills they

[2:58:30.320 --> 2:58:40.320]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[2:59:01.280 --> 2:59:10.320]  we are back with the summit news hour and i'm going to recap what i said in the first five
[2:59:10.320 --> 2:59:14.000]  and then we're going to delve into this news we've got a situation in the netherlands where
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:20.720]  they're talking about the edge of civil war basically 150 people arrested in response to
[2:59:20.720 --> 2:59:26.320]  these riots over curfew who is behind the riots we're going to get into that in a second but we
[2:59:26.320 --> 2:59:31.440]  have a situation in the united kingdom where we're still under a coronavirus lockdown maybe under
[2:59:31.440 --> 2:59:38.480]  one until the summer where people on twitter left us because new zealand was trending earlier saying
[2:59:38.480 --> 2:59:44.400]  why didn't we follow the example of new zealand and australia because they've basically defeated
[2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:51.200]  covid what a failure boris johnson is for not following that strategy that strategy the reason
[2:59:51.200 --> 2:59:57.760]  why they basically eliminated covid is because they closed their borders early and still have
[2:59:57.760 --> 3:00:02.000]  them closed not only that have come out and said we're going to keep them closed for the next year
[3:00:03.120 --> 3:00:08.480]  so you had the same leftist who back in march when we were saying close the borders said oh you
[3:00:08.480 --> 3:00:15.840]  can't do that it's xenophobic again going off the who script where they came out and said you
[3:00:15.840 --> 3:00:22.080]  can't profile chinese people coming into the airports because again that's discriminatory
[3:00:22.080 --> 3:00:27.840]  against chinese people in fact you had a whole public relations campaign in italy and i made a
[3:00:27.840 --> 3:00:33.360]  video about this last year where the mayor and the other authorities in florans and these other
[3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:41.520]  italian cities were paying people to go around the city and hug chinese people okay this was in
[3:00:41.520 --> 3:00:48.720]  january february right before the pandemic hit and it hit italy particularly hard if you'll remember
[3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:55.520]  the government there going off the who script was literally saying it's racist to not profile
[3:00:55.520 --> 3:01:01.280]  chinese people coming into our country and they literally paid people in a public relations stunt
[3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:09.840]  to go around the city and hug this uh asian man to prove they weren't racist so you go from that
[3:01:09.840 --> 3:01:16.800]  to what we're at now you go from trump closing the borders to many countries back near the start
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:22.800]  of the pandemic biden literally coming out and saying it was xenophobic to do that and now even
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:29.680]  today you have politico fact checking that and claiming oh biden never said trump was xenophobic
[3:01:29.680 --> 3:01:34.560]  for closing the borders to stop the spread of covid yes he did it's in black and white
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:40.480]  so all these people at the beginning of the pandemic have said it was xenophobic and racist
[3:01:40.480 --> 3:01:46.480]  to close the borders to stop the spread of covid 19 and now saying and now citing new
[3:01:46.480 --> 3:01:51.440]  zealand and these other countries that closed the borders and said well why didn't we do that
[3:01:51.440 --> 3:01:58.320]  because you opposed it at the start you went off the who script from the very beginning
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:04.320]  and now we have a situation in the netherlands where they've had three nights of brutal riots
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:10.320]  you've got people literally blowing up bridges because of 9 p.m curfew that was imposed as part
[3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:18.240]  of this latest lockdown meanwhile in the uk headline at summit news and we got the video
[3:02:18.240 --> 3:02:24.960]  which we're going to roll in a second covid police enter home to break up baby shower party
[3:02:24.960 --> 3:02:29.920]  a video out of the uk shows police in london entering a home to break up a baby shower party
[3:02:29.920 --> 3:02:35.760]  after a neighbor snitched on the family it's always the neighbors isn't it if you'll remember
[3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:40.560]  we had a few weeks ago another video which showed police entering a home in scotland
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:48.640]  and arresting family members on the mere allegation alone that they had violated social distancing
[3:02:48.640 --> 3:02:55.200]  and of course once again the tip-off came from a neighbor you have the top news programs in the
[3:02:55.200 --> 3:02:59.920]  united kingdom constantly asking oh well should we should we snitch on our friends and families
[3:02:59.920 --> 3:03:04.320]  and our neighbors for the greater good they constantly have this debate running in the
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:09.120]  background and now we're seeing more and more examples of it here is the clip out of east
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:15.200]  london where the police enter the home find a bunch of people tell the rest of them to leave
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:27.680]  because god forbid they were having a dinner party let's roll the clip hello okay i'm gonna leave
[3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:33.920]  me tonight uh who doesn't live here you don't all live here who doesn't live here
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:44.400]  well who owns the house or who is the main occupier then you me and him that's it
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:57.360]  is it a bit our baby shower okay we've had a call obviously because you're all here so
[3:03:57.360 --> 3:04:02.560]  obviously you're breaking covid rules we can find every adult here every single one of you
[3:04:02.560 --> 3:04:06.480]  200 pound each it is because you're breaking the rules
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:25.360]  that was in east london on sunday two of the men in the house were fined 200 pounds the rest
[3:04:25.360 --> 3:04:30.960]  were told to leave and as i pointed out in this article imagine if you told people a year ago
[3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:37.920]  that police would have the power to enter people's homes find family members and friends for having
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:43.440]  a dinner party they'd have called you completely insane and what situation do we have now everyone
[3:04:43.440 --> 3:04:49.920]  meekly accepts it and we've created this precedent where the government can impose any kind of
[3:04:49.920 --> 3:04:54.960]  measure whatsoever on the population they will meekly accept it under the guise of any emergency
[3:04:54.960 --> 3:05:02.880]  situation this is so dangerous and yet you look at the polls 70 percent of the population supports
[3:05:02.880 --> 3:05:09.680]  it how many would support it if you told them that it's not gonna end they're gonna keep bringing
[3:05:09.680 --> 3:05:16.400]  it back every single winter they're gonna make this mask mandate permanent now we have this
[3:05:16.400 --> 3:05:22.880]  headline cbs medical editor says americans should wear two face masks one's not good enough if you
[3:05:22.880 --> 3:05:29.280]  want to be a double plus good virtue signaling queen or king you have to wear two masks now of
[3:05:29.280 --> 3:05:34.880]  course by implication that means that masks don't work but let's not talk about that they literally
[3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:41.600]  have i mean maybe maybe two is not enough maybe three maybe a mask isn't enough maybe you need a
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:50.160]  gas mask maybe you need a hazmat suit again it's all a test of what you will tolerate and so far
[3:05:50.160 --> 3:05:53.920]  people have basically said oh we'll just we'll roll over and let you tickle our bellies we'll
[3:05:53.920 --> 3:06:01.120]  tolerate anything meanwhile the dastardly criminal offence of throwing a snowball is being brutally
[3:06:01.120 --> 3:06:08.160]  cracked down on once again in the united kingdom uk covid cops threatened 200 pound fines for people
[3:06:08.160 --> 3:06:14.320]  having snowball fights they've threatened it again numerous police forces over the past few days have
[3:06:14.320 --> 3:06:19.680]  come out and said don't you dare don't you dare in fact the quote from one of the police chiefs was
[3:06:19.680 --> 3:06:25.440]  don't be tempted snow fell in many parts of the country over the weekend providing a welcome
[3:06:25.440 --> 3:06:28.720]  distraction to the fact the country is being under some form of lockdown for the best part
[3:06:28.720 --> 3:06:35.280]  10 months and won't end until the summer probably maybe they'll give us a few months of freedom once
[3:06:35.280 --> 3:06:41.600]  again and by october november get back in the mask however this prompted authorities to become
[3:06:41.600 --> 3:06:46.640]  even more draconian urging people not to engage in snowball fights or sledging or face the risk of
[3:06:46.640 --> 3:06:52.720]  being fined forces in london sorry and wiltshire sent out warnings urging brits not to break lockdown
[3:06:53.680 --> 3:07:00.880]  while enjoying the snow so you had a bunch of tweaks from these inspectors of all these inspectors
[3:07:00.880 --> 3:07:06.480]  on twitter like to share their little political opinions and like to enforce everything on twitter
[3:07:06.480 --> 3:07:11.520]  i think i think individual police officers should be banned from tweeting at this point
[3:07:11.520 --> 3:07:18.960]  because they always use it to intimidate people kingston police said quote it's so beautiful to
[3:07:18.960 --> 3:07:23.680]  watch the snow fall from the comfort of your own home plus there's a pandemic going on so basically
[3:07:23.680 --> 3:07:29.680]  they're saying don't leave your home stay inside you can't even go outside in the snow even though
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:35.600]  it's in the law that you can go out and you can exercise but of course maybe not for much longer
[3:07:35.600 --> 3:07:41.680]  they're literally finding people for drinking coffee while they go on rural countryside walks
[3:07:42.880 --> 3:07:46.880]  video texas police officer threatens the taser man for not wearing a mask
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:53.120]  this happened a few months ago i think but it's just come out on twitter it's gone viral yesterday
[3:07:53.120 --> 3:07:58.480]  basically the cop completely overstepped his boundaries he immediately was confrontational
[3:07:58.480 --> 3:08:05.760]  with the individual that wears your mask immediately pointed a taser at him called for backup
[3:08:05.760 --> 3:08:11.200]  despite the fact that the man who was committing the deadly sin of not wearing a mask inside a
[3:08:11.200 --> 3:08:17.840]  gas station store questioned the officer briefly but then complied put his hands on his head
[3:08:17.840 --> 3:08:22.800]  didn't even say anything yet this police officer was on a power trip continued to point the taser
[3:08:22.800 --> 3:08:27.760]  at him and of course with biden's mask mandate we're only going to see more of this so don't
[3:08:27.760 --> 3:08:33.920]  use we'll be back don't go away cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left it can be very
[3:08:33.920 --> 3:08:39.760]  stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a family member suffering from this

[3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:04.080]  20 thanks to this info wars store products and by the way i bought 800 dollars worth the other night
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:10.160]  so i'm doing what i can brother so what my my contention is why don't we start this new year
[3:10:10.160 --> 3:10:16.080]  off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense now you gotta follow that up with
[3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:22.160]  the micro vx i learned that so it's like god working is so amazing we didn't know we didn't
[3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:26.720]  screen your call we had no idea and i go to you a year later and you're here telling people about
[3:10:26.720 --> 3:10:43.360]  living defense living defense living defense you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:50.480]  live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:10:50.480 --> 3:10:55.520]  we have 19388
[3:10:56.720 --> 3:11:03.120]  covid deaths under biden's watch of course the rules as have been set out over the past 10 months
[3:11:03.120 --> 3:11:07.760]  are that the sitting president no matter what he's done no matter what his policies are no matter
[3:11:07.760 --> 3:11:12.720]  how long he's been in office is personally and directly responsible for every single covid death
[3:11:12.720 --> 3:11:21.760]  the left set that rule so now biden's been responsible for almost 20 000 covid deaths in america we
[3:11:21.760 --> 3:11:26.560]  showed you that video before the break texas police officer threatens to tase a man for not wearing a
[3:11:26.560 --> 3:11:32.480]  mask and you're going to see more of that over the next 100 days with biden's mask challenge
[3:11:32.480 --> 3:11:38.560]  which doesn't apply to him he passed an executive order which said that masks must be worn on federal
[3:11:38.560 --> 3:11:44.960]  property and within i think it was about an hour of that violated his own order by not wearing a mask
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:50.800]  on federal property in fact his entire family wasn't wearing one the white house press secretary was
[3:11:50.800 --> 3:11:56.640]  asked about that by a fox news reporter she said well we got bigger issues to worry about what are
[3:11:56.640 --> 3:12:01.920]  those bigger issues well somebody asked a more important question which was would you keep the
[3:12:01.920 --> 3:12:09.760]  color scheme on air force one that's way bigger isn't it this is the media that we're now stuck
[3:12:09.760 --> 3:12:16.160]  with the next four years at least meanwhile governor newson to lift stay-at-home order
[3:12:16.160 --> 3:12:22.160]  less than a week after biden inauguration what a stunning coincidence california governor
[3:12:22.160 --> 3:12:28.000]  gavin newson is set to lift the stay-at-home order across all regions based on data that's not
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:35.440]  publicly available leading some to accuse him of playing politics and this has basically happened
[3:12:35.440 --> 3:12:41.680]  today what's interesting about it is it's obviously politically timed coming days after biden's
[3:12:41.680 --> 3:12:46.720]  inauguration what's funny about it though is i went in the comments on the twitter thread
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:53.280]  and it was all these leftists freaking out about the fact that cases were still rising in fact as
[3:12:53.280 --> 3:13:00.160]  i point out this article in this article on january 21st the state recorded its highest daily death
[3:13:00.160 --> 3:13:09.280]  toll ever registering 740 coronavirus fatalities so just mere days after that which occurred the
[3:13:09.280 --> 3:13:16.480]  day after the biden inauguration they're starting to lift the measures the restrictions the comments
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:22.320]  the respondents in the twitter thread were very panicky about this because of course they've
[3:13:22.320 --> 3:13:28.720]  been used to the propaganda over the past six months of this coronavirus being the most deadly
[3:13:28.720 --> 3:13:35.200]  thing since the bubonic plague despite the fact that 94 percent of people who die with it have
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:40.560]  numerous other serious illnesses we don't talk about that in the media do we but it's like
[3:13:40.560 --> 3:13:47.200]  they didn't get the memo they've been so relentlessly terrified and brainwashed over the past six to
[3:13:47.200 --> 3:13:52.960]  eight months that they don't know when to switch the script so they're still in the comments saying
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:57.200]  oh my god this is frightening why is he doing this we still need to lock down they haven't got
[3:13:57.200 --> 3:14:03.360]  the memo trump's gone now coronavirus is not a big deal biden's gonna ride to the rescue they
[3:14:03.360 --> 3:14:09.600]  didn't get the memo yet meanwhile in new york what a surprise quomo follows newsom in easing
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:16.560]  covid restrictions after biden inauguration another stunningly timed coincidence the governor said
[3:14:16.560 --> 3:14:20.960]  in a press conference the situation in relation to new cases and hospitalizations was improving
[3:14:21.520 --> 3:14:28.160]  again days after biden's inauguration meaning lockdown measures could be relaxed soon the
[3:14:28.160 --> 3:14:34.880]  steve courtes pointed out michigan chicago now california and now new york it's almost as if
[3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:41.200]  the science changed once biden became president how convenient for whitmer lightfoot and newsom
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:47.120]  using small businesses churches schools and citizens as pawns in a crass political game is
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:55.040]  evil so now all the restrictions are being lifted so biden can can rise to the occasion
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:03.600]  can rise can rise to the occasion as the saviour as the person who defeated covid because they're
[3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:08.880]  going to start not including the people who die of other serious illnesses as covid fatalities
[3:15:08.880 --> 3:15:15.280]  we've already seen that noises out of the who saying they're going to start doing that just
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:19.920]  days after biden is inaugurated and trunk leaves the white house what a stunning coincidence that
[3:15:19.920 --> 3:15:27.920]  is meanwhile merc scraps covid vaccine says it's more effective to get the virus and recover
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:34.400]  of course it's you've got way more chance of getting ill from the vaccine if you're a younger person
[3:15:34.400 --> 3:15:40.240]  and way more chance of becoming ill from the vaccine than the virus itself or at least in
[3:15:40.240 --> 3:15:46.080]  terms of fatalities again as a younger person well now vaccine manufacturer murk has abandoned
[3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:51.440]  development of two coronavirus vaccines saying that after extensive research it was concluded
[3:15:51.440 --> 3:15:56.880]  that the shots offered less protection than just contracting the virus itself and developing
[3:15:56.880 --> 3:16:05.200]  antibodies the company announced that the shots v590 and v591 were well tolerated by test patients
[3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:11.120]  however they generated an inferior immune system response in comparison with natural infection
[3:16:11.920 --> 3:16:16.960]  the company stated that instead it will focus on research into therapeutic drugs the drugs aim to
[3:16:16.960 --> 3:16:22.480]  protect patients from the damage of their own overactive immune response to the virus so it's
[3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:28.720]  better it's safer it's more effective to actually contract the virus itself develop the antibodies
[3:16:28.720 --> 3:16:34.880]  than take this murk vaccine which they're now abandoning of course there's still talk
[3:16:35.920 --> 3:16:41.200]  especially in the united kingdom as we're told about these new mutant strains from brazil and
[3:16:41.200 --> 3:16:49.040]  south africa as to whether the vaccines will be effective against these new strains of corona
[3:16:49.040 --> 3:16:56.640]  virus again they're assuring us that they will be other experts have questioned that so it remains
[3:16:56.640 --> 3:17:03.360]  to be seen meanwhile this is out of planet free will news paul will take over a decade to recover
[3:17:03.360 --> 3:17:10.400]  from lockdowns while rich thrive under rigged economic system and in fact there's a a table in
[3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:17.760]  this article an illustration which says the rich got richer during the pandemic and it shows the
[3:17:17.760 --> 3:17:27.760]  rapid increase in wealth from all the top billionaires just from the period of march 2020 to january 2021
[3:17:27.760 --> 3:17:33.280]  guess who's at the top of the list after elon musk who i would forgive because elon musk is
[3:17:33.280 --> 3:17:39.840]  actually a lockdown skeptic and he's not made money out of it by eliminating his competition
[3:17:39.840 --> 3:17:45.680]  guess who's after him yes it's jeff bezos who basically now everyone is forced to get deliveries
[3:17:45.680 --> 3:17:51.440]  from amazon because everywhere else is shut down he's made a ton of money bill gates is up there
[3:17:51.440 --> 3:17:56.400]  mark zuckerbergs up there they're all rolling in it these are the same people who are telling you
[3:17:56.400 --> 3:18:01.760]  they're gonna look after the little guy and the great reset that comes as a result of exploiting
[3:18:01.760 --> 3:18:08.480]  what they call the opportunity of the pandemic will make everyone healthier and happier and
[3:18:08.480 --> 3:18:15.360]  more prosperous it hasn't so far as it's made everybody poorer it's made billionaire oligarchs
[3:18:15.360 --> 3:18:21.680]  richer that's the great reset in what is no secret to any regular reader of this blog the
[3:18:21.680 --> 3:18:26.960]  covet 19 pandemic and the lockdowns it justified has in the world's words of world health organization
[3:18:26.960 --> 3:18:34.720]  envoy david naboro made the poor a lot poorer now we have an oxfam report released yesterday
[3:18:34.720 --> 3:18:40.160]  which reveals that covet 19 and its economic ripple effects is negatively affecting just about every
[3:18:40.160 --> 3:18:44.640]  country globally at once in particular it's going to strike hard at the lower rung of the economic
[3:18:44.640 --> 3:18:49.280]  ladder with the report claiming it could take more than a decade for the world's poorest to
[3:18:49.280 --> 3:18:55.600]  recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic everyone's going out of business small family
[3:18:55.600 --> 3:19:02.880]  run businesses are going to the wall jeff bezos though he's rolling in it bill gates mark zuckerberg
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:08.720]  they're rolling in it these are the same people the same tech elites the same technocrats now
[3:19:08.720 --> 3:19:15.040]  meeting at davos outlining their great reset agenda where they say they're going to reorder
[3:19:15.040 --> 3:19:19.920]  the global economy as a result of this covet pandemic well what's happened so far they've
[3:19:19.920 --> 3:19:25.200]  reordered it to the point where the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer
[3:19:25.200 --> 3:19:29.920]  that's their great reset and that's why we need to resist it i'm sure dictionary has a very simple
[3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:36.400]  definition of terrorism other dictionaries have somewhere else terrorism is the threat of force
[3:19:36.400 --> 3:19:43.280]  or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason it's basically scaring the
[3:19:43.280 --> 3:19:48.640]  hell out of people until you submit to them that's exactly what all this overblown covet 19
[3:19:48.640 --> 3:19:54.240]  garbage is you see the headlines from cnn abc knows doctors say it's worse than they ever thought
[3:19:54.240 --> 3:19:59.600]  covet more dumbest thing they could ever imagine they told us that two and a half million people
[3:19:59.600 --> 3:20:06.560]  would be dead just eight months ago within three months okay it's a quarter million if you count all
[3:20:06.560 --> 3:20:11.760]  of the people that died of other things we're talking 96 had comorbidity these are real numbers
[3:20:11.760 --> 3:20:17.120]  these are real facts this is the chicken little event we all run our houses never come out they're
[3:20:17.120 --> 3:20:22.160]  taught we're not essential all the big box stores in amazon take over the planet rebuke it stand up
[3:20:22.160 --> 3:20:29.520]  against it this is slavery it is not something you could put up with and survive president
[3:20:29.520 --> 3:20:34.480]  trump won in the landslide on the number third but the globalists weren't gonna let that happen
[3:20:35.520 --> 3:20:38.720]  they had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement
[3:20:39.360 --> 3:20:45.760]  emanating from the united states that spread across the world from the uk to brazil they were
[3:20:45.760 --> 3:20:50.720]  desperate they admitted their own publications they didn't know what to do and so they put out
[3:20:50.720 --> 3:20:57.200]  80 million fake ballots violated state law and stole it better than dollars and now they're coming
[3:20:57.200 --> 3:21:01.680]  after the president they're coming after you they're coming after me they're shutting everybody off

[3:22:33.760 --> 3:22:46.240]  you're listening to summit dot news with paul joseph watson
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:55.520]  of course following the capital riot a couple of weeks ago paul was basically blamed for it
[3:22:55.520 --> 3:22:59.840]  they were wiped off the internet they were banned from the app store later turned out according to
[3:22:59.840 --> 3:23:06.080]  the washington post that the predominant planning for the violence at the capital building was
[3:23:06.080 --> 3:23:12.320]  conducted on facebook nobody's calling for facebook to be banned of course because mark zuckerberg
[3:23:12.320 --> 3:23:17.920]  is in the club now they're calling for telegram to be banned we've got this special report now
[3:23:17.920 --> 3:23:23.840]  we're going to roll it this same group that basically d-platform parlor is now going after
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:30.720]  telegram because again it's not controlled by silicon valley big tech overlords here is the clip
[3:23:31.760 --> 3:23:36.560]  and then they came for telegram the parlor precedent lawsuit calls on apple to drop
[3:23:36.560 --> 3:23:42.240]  telegram from app store a week after apple was targeted in the same way california court has
[3:23:42.240 --> 3:23:46.480]  been asked to force google to remove telegram from its play store over claims that the messenger app
[3:23:46.480 --> 3:23:50.800]  was used to incite violence the legal challenge mirrors a similar suit brought against apple
[3:23:50.800 --> 3:23:57.520]  file by mark ginsberg the former u.s. ambassador to morocco the lawsuit claims the popular app is
[3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:06.320]  used to spread violence extremism and anti-semitism ginsberg's non-profit coalition for a safer web
[3:24:06.880 --> 3:24:11.520]  was also listed as a plaintiff the complaint notes that google suspended parlor a twitter
[3:24:11.520 --> 3:24:16.240]  like conservative micro blogging site from its app store due to some users expressing support for
[3:24:16.240 --> 3:24:21.520]  the violence that rocked the capital on january 6 according to ginsberg telegram should receive the
[3:24:21.520 --> 3:24:26.160]  same treatment google has not taken any action against telegram comparable to the action it is
[3:24:26.160 --> 3:24:30.800]  taken against parlor to compel telegram to improve its content moderation policies the suit alleges
[3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:40.800]  so first of all who is behind the coalition for a safer web mark ginsberg who also worked as a
[3:24:40.800 --> 3:24:46.880]  reviewer according to his wikipedia profile of united states foreign and economic policy for
[3:24:46.880 --> 3:24:54.160]  groups such as the council on foreign relations which is of course as you probably know an elitist
[3:24:54.160 --> 3:25:00.480]  internationalist globalist front group he was appointed ambassador to morocco by bill clinton
[3:25:01.280 --> 3:25:06.400]  ginsberg regularly contributes articles to periodicals such as the washington post the
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:11.040]  wall street journal the financial times the new york times huffington post he's also a regular
[3:25:11.040 --> 3:25:18.560]  cnn guess this is a mainstream media guy the advisory board of the coalition for a safer web
[3:25:19.120 --> 3:25:28.800]  includes lester crown who is chairman of the board of guess who the council on foreign relations
[3:25:29.360 --> 3:25:34.560]  now they had another suit in northern car uh northern california last week against apple the
[3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:40.400]  exact same thing alleging that telegram was being used to coordinate and incite extreme
[3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:46.960]  violence before the inauguration of president elect joe biden that didn't happen there wasn't
[3:25:46.960 --> 3:25:52.960]  any violence immediately before or during the inauguration of biden didn't happen so that was a lie
[3:25:54.080 --> 3:26:01.520]  what is telegram if you don't use it it's mainly a messenger app it's mainly used for people to
[3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:07.600]  communicate securely without people without companies invading their privacy between individuals
[3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:14.240]  now it does have a feature where you can have a group on there and because god forbid they allow
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:21.200]  some semblance of free speech now they're on the chopping block too of course section 230
[3:26:21.840 --> 3:26:26.960]  of the communications act says that no provider or user of an interactive computer service
[3:26:26.960 --> 3:26:32.320]  shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information
[3:26:32.320 --> 3:26:40.400]  content provider so providers like facebook and twitter are legally liable for what their users
[3:26:40.400 --> 3:26:47.840]  post but apparently parlor and telegram are different rules for different companies even
[3:26:47.840 --> 3:26:52.880]  though they provide the exact same service provided by facebook and twitter and as we
[3:26:52.880 --> 3:26:58.960]  know the capital hill storming of the building the capital hill riot was not primarily planned on
[3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:04.720]  parlor it was not primarily planned on gab it was not primarily planned on telegram it was
[3:27:04.720 --> 3:27:13.440]  primarily planned on facebook the washington post even acknowledged this reporting a growing body
[3:27:13.440 --> 3:27:19.200]  of evidence shows that facebook played a much larger role in the storming of the building and
[3:27:19.200 --> 3:27:26.320]  it's very interesting to know who helped the washington post write this story who helped identify
[3:27:26.320 --> 3:27:32.720]  the fact that the majority of the planning for the riot the storming of the building on capital hill
[3:27:32.720 --> 3:27:39.840]  was planned on facebook who helped them with that research the coalition for a safer web the same
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:46.400]  organization that's calling for telegram for parlor to be banned on app stores to be booted
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:52.400]  off the web entirely acknowledges within its own work with the washington post that the majority
[3:27:52.400 --> 3:27:59.840]  of the planning for that riot happened on facebook why aren't they calling for facebook to be banned
[3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:05.360]  from the app store from the google play store well of course we know why because mr zuckerberg is in
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:14.240]  the club and mr durov who owns telegram isn't mr matz who owns parlor isn't they're not in the
[3:28:14.240 --> 3:28:20.400]  council on foreign relations they're not in the club they're not part of the elite so despite the
[3:28:20.400 --> 3:28:25.440]  fact that this very same organization has done the research which proves the riots were planned
[3:28:25.440 --> 3:28:31.680]  mainly on facebook they just want facebook to ban more conservatives they don't want facebook
[3:28:31.680 --> 3:28:36.880]  to be removed from the app store from the google play store now the main reason why they hate durov
[3:28:36.880 --> 3:28:42.960]  pavel durov who owns telegram is that he's at least somewhat tolerant of free speech on the
[3:28:42.960 --> 3:28:49.120]  platform and oh god forbid right god forbid the common misconception of course is that telegram is
[3:28:49.120 --> 3:28:57.040]  this vladimir putin kremlin front it isn't durov is actually a putin critic and telegram itself has
[3:28:57.040 --> 3:29:04.080]  proved key and crucial as an organizing platform for many of the anti-putin protests you've seen
[3:29:04.080 --> 3:29:08.160]  more of those over the past few days so you have this myth in the media that it's some
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:13.600]  secret russian operation to steal everyone's data that durov himself came out after the capitol hill
[3:29:16.240 --> 3:29:22.800]  wing groups on telegram anyway so they're already banning people for the first time ever generally
[3:29:22.800 --> 3:29:29.680]  but only as far as i've seen when they call for explicit violence so they're only banning people
[3:29:29.680 --> 3:29:35.760]  who actually break the law but durov has said before over the past week in fact he said people
[3:29:35.760 --> 3:29:41.520]  were being quote held hostage by big tech monopolies this is why they don't like him he also said
[3:29:41.520 --> 3:29:45.520]  they no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away
[3:29:45.520 --> 3:29:52.160]  with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users which of course applies
[3:29:52.160 --> 3:29:59.360]  is applicable to facebook they were key crucial in being the platform that hosted the planning for
[3:29:59.360 --> 3:30:03.760]  the capitol hill riot they're not going to get banned on the app store because mark zuckerberg
[3:30:03.760 --> 3:30:10.960]  zuckerberg has too much power telegram has 500 million users that's seven percent of the global
[3:30:10.960 --> 3:30:17.440]  population and they're still trying to ban it again it's mainly a messenger service in fact i
[3:30:17.440 --> 3:30:23.760]  even read calls in the media to ban signal which you can't even post anything in a social media
[3:30:23.760 --> 3:30:31.120]  context on signal it's a messenger app just like whatsapp or just like i message on an iphone yet
[3:30:31.120 --> 3:30:36.160]  they're now that's talking about banning that talking about banning people from communicating
[3:30:36.160 --> 3:30:43.520]  with individuals basically anything not controlled by silicon valley oligarchs it has to go so now
[3:30:43.520 --> 3:30:47.680]  they're going after telegram because it allows some semblance of free speech they're doing it in a
[3:30:47.680 --> 3:30:53.520]  bad faith argument claiming that it was used to plan pre inauguration riots against biden that
[3:30:53.520 --> 3:30:59.520]  never happened the predominant amount of planning for the violence that happened at capitol hill
[3:30:59.520 --> 3:31:04.080]  happened on facebook nobody's calling for that to be banned we have facebook embroiled in
[3:31:04.880 --> 3:31:10.400]  child pornography scandals where that's the main facilitator facebook messenger of child
[3:31:10.400 --> 3:31:15.920]  pornography in the world of course instagram owned by facebook is a massive facilitator of
[3:31:15.920 --> 3:31:21.360]  prostitution throughout the world no calls to ban that because they're in the club but this
[3:31:21.360 --> 3:31:27.200]  organization which has on it two individuals who were involved with the council on foreign relations
[3:31:27.200 --> 3:31:33.920]  and internationalist elitist from now once telegram gone so again de-platforming has nothing to do
[3:31:33.920 --> 3:31:40.880]  with stopping hate harassment doxing and violence conservatives have been the primary victims of
[3:31:40.880 --> 3:31:47.680]  hate harassment doxing and violence on facebook on twitter for years once again de-platforming
[3:31:47.680 --> 3:31:53.280]  is about leftists and internationalist front groups silencing their political adversaries
[3:31:53.280 --> 3:31:58.400]  and big tech billionaire owned corporations eliminating their competition
[3:32:03.040 --> 3:32:07.360]  so there you have it and then there's another headline here at the new york post actually
[3:32:07.360 --> 3:32:12.720]  in regards to telegram facebook user phone numbers reportedly being sold on telegram by
[3:32:12.720 --> 3:32:18.320]  criminal network so that's yet another reason they will use to try to get it banned on the app
[3:32:18.320 --> 3:32:22.880]  store we're going to come back and talk about the riots in the netherlands who's truly behind
[3:32:22.880 --> 3:32:26.640]  them what's going to happen with them they're talking about a civil war is it really that bad

[3:36:56.640 --> 3:37:00.400]  we're live in this final segment i'm going to get into what's happening in the netherlands
[3:37:00.400 --> 3:37:06.480]  with the riot who's behind them the rioting against a covid curfew uh that has been put
[3:37:06.480 --> 3:37:12.640]  into place from nine p.m onwards first though we got one more report to get to and this is in
[3:37:12.640 --> 3:37:19.760]  relation to how they're now talking about a pandemic economy years into the future we're
[3:37:19.760 --> 3:37:25.120]  being told that this is supposedly going to end over the next six months or so as we go into the
[3:37:25.120 --> 3:37:30.720]  summer industries are not preparing as if that's the case they're preparing like this is going to
[3:37:30.720 --> 3:37:36.160]  go on for years and years and years as bill gates and others have said and now they're talking about
[3:37:36.160 --> 3:37:42.400]  repurposing robots not just for social distancing not just for enforcing mask wearing but for
[3:37:42.400 --> 3:37:48.560]  literally replacing humans so people who are isolated and alone can have some form of what
[3:37:48.560 --> 3:37:56.080]  they call human connection and yet this entity this sophia robot is certainly not human so let's go
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:38:02.000]  ahead and roll that clip here it is the robots are coming not only to take your jobs but to
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:07.360]  shout at you if you fail to comply with lockdown measures rt reports hong kong based hansen robotics
[3:38:07.360 --> 3:38:12.880]  makers of the viral sensation humanoid robots so fear have announced plans to mass produce robots
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:19.520]  by the end of 2021 for use in multiple sectors in the pandemic economy my name is sophia they
[3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:26.640]  created her to promote human to machine empathy and compassion apparently sophia is going to
[3:38:26.640 --> 3:38:32.960]  keep you safe by keeping you away from actual humans people need to be isolated from each other
[3:38:32.960 --> 3:38:38.640]  um uh because to be around people is dangerous these days she's also going to provide you that
[3:38:38.640 --> 3:38:45.360]  missing human warmth and connection despite being non-human these robots can keep people say from
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:50.240]  danger while still providing that kind of human warmth that human connection her new role is in
[3:38:50.240 --> 3:38:55.280]  the healthcare sector taking temperatures with a thermal camera on her chest other robots are
[3:38:55.280 --> 3:39:08.480]  already being used in singapore to enforce social distancing this little fella is scanning your
[3:39:08.480 --> 3:39:22.000]  face to make sure you're wearing a mask hansen robotics is launching a new robot this year
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:27.760]  called grace developed specifically for healthcare other big players in the industry are also taking
[3:39:27.760 --> 3:39:34.800]  note softbank robotics peppa robot was deployed to detect people who weren't wearing masks in china
[3:39:34.800 --> 3:39:40.880]  robotics company cloud mines helped set up a robot run field hospital in wuhan great they're taking
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:46.000]  your jobs and making you obsolete but don't worry just give up all your possessions and property to
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:51.360]  the world economic forum and in return you'll get universal basic income i mean you'll become
[3:39:51.360 --> 3:39:57.360]  pathetically dependent on shadowy unaccountable technocrats will become your 21st century feudalist
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:40:03.040]  overlords you'll have no self-worth whatsoever as what little drive and authenticity in your life
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:09.200]  drains away completely but hey those tv shows aren't gonna watch themselves maybe sophia will let you
[3:40:09.200 --> 3:40:15.360]  play with her transistors apparently these cyborgs are also getting woke i am hoping that through my
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:20.160]  work kindness and tolerance will win out over ignorance and impatience i would like to thank
[3:40:20.160 --> 3:40:25.840]  the ministry of tolerance integration of all cultures nationalities and ethnicities are part
[3:40:25.840 --> 3:40:32.960]  of my objectives i celebrate human diversity also on the ecum please be safe i can see it now
[3:40:32.960 --> 3:40:38.720]  sophia overhears you complaining about an ethnic minority's behavior in an airport security line
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:43.520]  you're in big trouble that'll be an automatic 100 point deduction from your social credit score your
[3:40:43.520 --> 3:40:49.440]  flight to the caribbean is canceled and you're eating soup for the next month this begs the question
[3:40:49.440 --> 3:40:54.240]  if we're supposed to be in the final months of the pandemic if the harsher lockdown measures are
[3:40:54.240 --> 3:40:59.760]  supposed to be being lifted if we're finally getting back to normal if lockdowns are supposed to be
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:06.480]  coming to an end why are they developing robots to be used years into the future to enforce lockdowns
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:13.040]  if the pandemic is nearly over why are they deploying robots for a pandemic economy really
[3:41:13.040 --> 3:41:22.640]  makes you think and as you saw there they were talking about in the video oh my god it's so
[3:41:22.640 --> 3:41:28.320]  dangerous to be around humans these days we need to replace them basically with robots that echoes
[3:41:28.320 --> 3:41:32.720]  what the club of rome said the club of rome is basically the same group of people that's behind
[3:41:32.720 --> 3:41:38.720]  davos the world economic forum it's the global elite that's the same justification they use to
[3:41:38.720 --> 3:41:45.760]  panic everybody into accepting reductions in living standards by fear mongering about global
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:51.840]  warning what global warming by making humanity itself the enemy and in fact in their first
[3:41:51.840 --> 3:41:58.000]  publication the first global revolution they said this quote this is the club of rome there's no
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:03.280]  shadowy secret group that doesn't exist this is literally what they published they said quote the
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:09.440]  common enemy of humanity is man in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea
[3:42:09.440 --> 3:42:14.160]  that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the light would fit the bill
[3:42:14.160 --> 3:42:19.440]  all these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and
[3:42:19.440 --> 3:42:26.560]  behavior that they can be overcome the real enemy then is humanity itself and once again with this
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:32.560]  coronavirus pandemic they're making humanity itself the enemy as he's run that clip with people saying
[3:42:32.560 --> 3:42:37.920]  no it's so dangerous to be around humans we can't be having that anymore can we we'll have to get all
[3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:43.600]  our connections all our social dopamine from robots they're literally not only saying they're
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:49.200]  going to replace you in healthcare and all these other jobs they're going to replace humans for
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:55.840]  human to human relationships and we're only at the start of that process let's get into this
[3:42:55.840 --> 3:43:01.360]  netherland situation now though because there's a headline up on new york post netherlands on
[3:43:01.360 --> 3:43:07.840]  brink of civil war as rioters strike again over covid 19 curfew anti lockdown protesters in the
[3:43:07.840 --> 3:43:13.760]  netherlands set fires looted stores and fought with cops for a third consecutive night of rioting
[3:43:13.760 --> 3:43:19.280]  after a strict curfew was imposed with a mayor warning that the nation was quote on our way
[3:43:19.280 --> 3:43:28.640]  to civil war they had 184 people arrested during last night's riots alone tear gas water cannons
[3:43:28.640 --> 3:43:34.640]  a lot cops being injured as rioters have struck in at least 20 cities and towns across the netherlands
[3:43:34.640 --> 3:43:40.800]  since saturday when the nation was forced into its first curfew since world war two literally
[3:43:40.800 --> 3:43:47.760]  since Nazi occupation they're now under curfew for the first time the head of the police trade
[3:43:47.760 --> 3:43:53.520]  union said we haven't seen so much violence in 40 years the thing to note about this and this is what
[3:43:53.520 --> 3:44:00.320]  gert weilders has come out and said you have a group of people who have peacefully protested against
[3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:08.400]  curfew against lockdown measures similar to germany where you saw those mostly peaceful in the lexicon
[3:44:08.400 --> 3:44:15.040]  of cnn but actually peaceful being hit by water cannons this is a different group you'll notice
[3:44:15.040 --> 3:44:19.440]  in some of the footage they're using fireworks they're throwing fireworks they're setting off
[3:44:19.440 --> 3:44:26.800]  fireworks as if they were improvised explosive devices this is a tactic of migrant gangs we've
[3:44:26.800 --> 3:44:32.560]  seen this throughout sweden over the past three or four years we've seen it in germany over the
[3:44:32.560 --> 3:44:38.960]  past four years we saw it in cologne on new year's eve 2015 where there was the mass sexual
[3:44:38.960 --> 3:44:45.920]  molestation of a thousand women as gert weilders has pointed out this is being hijacked by criminal
[3:44:45.920 --> 3:44:51.840]  migrant groups in the major cities in the netherlands to loot stores to injure police officers
[3:44:51.840 --> 3:44:57.440]  and to cause absolute bedlam that's not to say that the police reaction in a lot of cases
[3:44:57.440 --> 3:45:02.640]  has not been completely out of control there are numerous videos of them just whacking people on
[3:45:02.640 --> 3:45:07.520]  the head people who just sat in parks peacefully minding their own business so you've got a
[3:45:07.520 --> 3:45:14.640]  complete overreaction on the side of the police officers but you've also got deliberate provocations
[3:45:14.640 --> 3:45:22.400]  by criminal gangs of migrants setting fire to cars looting stores and throwing fireworks at people
[3:45:22.400 --> 3:45:29.680]  which is their speciality breitbart reports on this dutch coronavirus riots worst in 40 years
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:37.120]  says unrest has spread out the major dutch cities to dozens of smaller towns police officers have
[3:45:37.120 --> 3:45:42.080]  been injured it says unusually prime minister mark rutter and the leader of the opposition
[3:45:42.080 --> 3:45:46.880]  right wing populist gert weilders seemed to be in accord with both men condemning the violence
[3:45:46.880 --> 3:45:50.720]  although their views on specific elements of the unrest and how to deal with the attacks differed
[3:45:51.520 --> 3:45:56.640]  so the prime minister said quote the rights the riots have nothing to do with protesting or fighting
[3:45:56.640 --> 3:46:03.440]  for freedom weilders said he supported the peaceful demonstrations but the violent riots went beyond
[3:46:03.440 --> 3:46:10.000]  what is acceptable he said the government should deploy the army onto the streets to deal with what
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:16.720]  he called scum underlining his point the anti-mass migration leader of the dutch opposition freedom
[3:46:16.720 --> 3:46:23.280]  party shared footage of gangs of young men attacking police looting shops and setting off
[3:46:23.280 --> 3:46:30.000]  large fireworks this is their speciality he wrote quote in the netherlands the often immigrant scum
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:34.880]  is destroying our country his words they have nothing to do with the netherlands they do not
[3:46:34.880 --> 3:46:41.680]  share our values deploy our army now so again you have a group of peaceful protesters but
[3:46:41.680 --> 3:46:47.040]  this is obviously being hijacked by criminal elements many of them migrants who just want
[3:46:47.040 --> 3:46:52.480]  to cause absolute bedlam and chaos that's what's happening in the netherlands they're talking
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:47:00.000]  about a civil war how bad will it get we had similar scenes in germany that didn't spill over
[3:47:00.000 --> 3:47:05.600]  too bad into a dire situation but you did have a situation where they were literally
[3:47:06.880 --> 3:47:12.320]  getting inside the bunda stag and it de-escalated from there but it's getting scary in the netherlands
[3:47:12.320 --> 3:47:30.800]  and it could get worse that's going to wrap it up summit.news we'll be right back
