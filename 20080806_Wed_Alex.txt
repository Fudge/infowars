[00:00.000 --> 00:07.480]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.480 --> 00:15.520]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:18.120 --> 00:29.320]  It is Wednesday the 6th day of August 2008 and for the next four hours we are
[00:29.320 --> 00:38.880]  going to have wide open phones. Wide open phones for the next four hours. It is
[00:38.880 --> 00:44.920]  bizarre being here in my office with the moving trucks here this morning as 90
[00:44.920 --> 00:49.160]  percent of the office has now been moved out of here just this morning and it's
[00:49.160 --> 00:55.200]  just a little old me sitting here in my tiny little studio which will still be
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.120]  here the next few months as we finish building the new radio studio and the
[01:00.120 --> 01:07.560]  TV studio. We are busy little bees over at the new 7,800 square foot office
[01:07.560 --> 01:14.080]  which is big for us. This one's about 2,400 square feet and we have another
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.360]  even smaller office. We've had two offices and it's been confusing and
[01:18.360 --> 01:23.160]  caused problems over the last few years. Well we are now moving into one big
[01:23.160 --> 01:28.480]  office thanks to you the listeners supporting us with the Info Wars money
[01:28.480 --> 01:34.000]  bomb. Everything we do, everything we've been able to accomplish is because of you.
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.120]  Yes we work long hours, yes we make good films and we travel to dangerous hot
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.080]  spots to cover things. We bring you the best guest but it's a team effort all
[01:43.080 --> 01:47.720]  of us together in this fight against the New World Order. You have our continued
[01:47.720 --> 01:52.560]  commitment to work as hard as we can to do the best job we can to bring you the
[01:52.560 --> 01:56.760]  most accurate and up-to-date information. Does that mean we're perfect? No. Does it
[01:56.760 --> 02:02.080]  mean we don't drop the ball? No. Does it mean that we never make mistakes? No but
[02:02.080 --> 02:07.440]  we're doing the best job we can and I want to thank every one of you in the
[02:07.440 --> 02:13.000]  United States, Canada, Europe, Mexico, Latin America, Asia, all of our supporters
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.680]  all the PrisonPlanet.tv members. We just make that better and better for you
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.040]  now four plus years into having PrisonPlanet.tv. All of you that get the
[02:22.040 --> 02:26.120]  books and videos and DVDs off of the website and then we also bring on all
[02:26.120 --> 02:29.240]  these other guests and try to support their outreaches and what they're doing
[02:29.240 --> 02:33.880]  and building this as a platform for everyone who are team players against the
[02:33.880 --> 02:40.080]  New World Order. We are Team Liberty, Team Freedom, Team Humanity, Team
[02:40.080 --> 02:45.720]  Anti-Dehumanization and it's great to work with all of you but it takes me back
[02:45.720 --> 02:52.880]  to three plus years ago we moved into this office from my tiny 700 square
[02:52.880 --> 02:57.040]  foot office. Yes, 700 square foot office that had three people and it will four
[02:57.040 --> 03:01.080]  counting me then I would broadcast out of my house. I mean that's the type of
[03:01.080 --> 03:05.080]  growth that we've been seeing here and I should have tried to grow earlier. I
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.840]  tried to really keep it small. I tried to never raise funds. I refused almost all
[03:10.840 --> 03:14.440]  advertising. I didn't even really have advertising except for a few web banners
[03:14.440 --> 03:18.600]  if somebody emailed me. We'd sell them a $500 ad banner and we didn't have the
[03:18.600 --> 03:23.120]  funds to expand or do anything and then I realized about three years ago I said
[03:23.120 --> 03:27.160]  we better grow. I mean we're already the tip of the spear the biggest thing in
[03:27.160 --> 03:31.600]  media in the fight against the New World Order and that wasn't saying much and so
[03:31.600 --> 03:36.160]  we have expanded. We're now about to expand even more and yes your support is
[03:36.160 --> 03:39.880]  needed more than ever to spread the word about info wars.com and
[03:39.880 --> 03:44.800]  prismplatter.com on the message boards and MySpace and YouTube to buy the books
[03:44.800 --> 03:50.400]  and videos to support the sponsors. You know people complain and we're not
[03:50.400 --> 03:56.280]  perfect. Every day Kurt Nemo's in there banning different ads on infowars.com.
[03:56.280 --> 03:59.920]  He's banned it I think eight different times the last week these anti-Barack
[03:59.920 --> 04:05.160]  Obama ads. I'm not for Barack Obama but I don't want to have anti-Barack Obama
[04:05.160 --> 04:10.800]  pro John McCain ads on and Google continues to change the URL address that
[04:10.800 --> 04:14.600]  that advertiser wants to be on our site and so I'm at the point I'm about to
[04:14.600 --> 04:19.080]  have to dump Google advertising well that's $6,000 a month. That pays for
[04:19.080 --> 04:24.200]  almost two employees. We won't be able to operate without that so what will I
[04:24.200 --> 04:28.520]  have to do? I'm about to dump Google ads. I mean I'm thinking about it. I'll have
[04:28.520 --> 04:33.120]  to get other sponsors. I'll have to beg for you to buy my videos which I don't
[04:33.120 --> 04:38.520]  like doing. So support us and we'll be able to have less ads and less
[04:38.520 --> 04:41.680]  commercialism and all of it but hey I got to get the money to fund this
[04:41.680 --> 04:46.120]  operation somewhere ladies and gentlemen so support us. All right ton of news wide

[06:56.800 --> 07:00.840]  the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of
[07:00.840 --> 07:04.520]  American families. Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than
[07:04.520 --> 07:08.200]  it was about a year ago. Food costs continue to double because there's no
[07:08.200 --> 07:14.120]  food worldwide. The only solution is to use now and store for later great

[07:54.640 --> 08:00.480]  Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or
[08:00.480 --> 08:05.960]  scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are going
[08:05.960 --> 08:10.240]  bust, chop keepers keep a gun under the counter. Bunks are running wild in the
[08:10.240 --> 08:13.000]  street. There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to
[08:13.000 --> 08:19.800]  it. We know the air is unfit to breathe. Our food is unfit to eat. We sit
[08:19.800 --> 08:23.520]  watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us of today we had
[08:23.520 --> 08:27.920]  15 homeless eyes of 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[08:27.920 --> 08:32.520]  We know things are bad worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything
[08:32.520 --> 08:36.360]  everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house and
[08:36.360 --> 08:39.280]  slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is
[08:39.280 --> 08:43.560]  please at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and
[08:43.560 --> 08:47.520]  my TV and my steel belt and radios and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.
[08:47.520 --> 08:52.880]  Well I'm not going to leave you alone. I want you to get mad. I don't want you to
[08:52.880 --> 08:56.000]  protest. I don't want you to ride. I don't want you to write to your congressman
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.840]  because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about
[08:58.840 --> 09:02.440]  the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All
[09:02.440 --> 09:07.160]  I know is that first you've got to get mad. You've got to say I'm a human being.
[09:07.160 --> 09:15.320]  My life has value. I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of
[09:15.320 --> 09:22.120]  your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it and stick
[09:22.120 --> 09:27.440]  your head out and yell. I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[09:27.440 --> 09:34.200]  I want you to get up right now. Get up. Go to your windows. Open them and stick
[09:34.200 --> 09:41.200]  your head out and yell. I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[09:41.200 --> 10:08.200]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. We are now 10 minutes and 15 seconds into this
[10:08.200 --> 10:15.200]  world-wide transmission. You want to bring up every issue under the sun. You want to
[10:15.200 --> 10:18.200]  attack me. You want to disagree with me. You want to agree. You've got a question. You've
[10:18.200 --> 10:24.200]  got a news item. We've got Blackwater involved in now. Anti-Marijuana, medical marijuana
[10:24.200 --> 10:29.200]  raids. The evidence shows from the LA Times. We've got them gearing up for an attack on
[10:29.200 --> 10:34.200]  Iran. We have what's happening to the dollar and the economy. It's now coming out with
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.200]  top bioweapons experts that worked with this latest patch. He didn't have access to it.
[10:39.200 --> 10:44.200]  He couldn't have made it. It's a cover-up. Huge news on the anthrax front. There is
[10:44.200 --> 10:49.200]  so much. Whatever you want to discuss today, you are welcome to call in with it.
[10:49.200 --> 10:55.200]  800-259-9231. I've got a bunch of news coming up. Let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[10:55.200 --> 11:00.200]  Here's the deal. If I'm going to get to your calls, no matter how interesting or informative
[11:00.200 --> 11:06.200]  they are, I have to move on after a few minutes. Have your points ready. Be ready to go because
[11:06.200 --> 11:10.200]  you're not going to be holding long today. I am going to take... I've only been able
[11:10.200 --> 11:14.200]  to do this a few times when I put my mind to it. We can take unlimited calls here,
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.200]  millions of listeners, but I'm always bad about getting diverted, distracted, but it's
[11:18.200 --> 11:24.200]  always great when I'm able to force myself to not linger on a call or not get off on
[11:24.200 --> 11:28.200]  one of my tirades. We're actually able to take your calls because it brings up so many
[11:28.200 --> 11:33.200]  issues, so many angles, spinning the wheel of fortune, reaching into the hat. What will
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.200]  we pull out? Jay in Florida, you're on the air. Welcome.
[11:37.200 --> 11:39.200]  Hey, Alex. Thank you very much. How are you?
[11:39.200 --> 11:40.200]  Good.
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.200]  Good. Listen, I want to first say, I mean, I've been listening to your show every day.
[11:43.200 --> 11:46.200]  The last couple of days, the news is just ugly. They're hitting us at all angles. It's
[11:46.200 --> 11:50.200]  depressing. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone sometimes. I feel like I'm watching
[11:50.200 --> 11:54.200]  a movie, but I just want to say something real positive if I could real quick.
[11:54.200 --> 11:58.200]  A couple of years ago, if somebody told me the government did 9-11, I probably would
[11:58.200 --> 12:04.200]  have been ready to fight them, but it's because of you. You've opened my eyes. I understand
[12:04.200 --> 12:09.200]  everything now, how the world works, basically, and I want to thank you for that.
[12:09.200 --> 12:14.200]  I'm 38 years old. I had a baby daughter 11 months ago, and it's because of you. She's
[12:14.200 --> 12:18.200]  not poisoned with vaccines. A couple of years ago, if I had that, my girl, I probably would
[12:18.200 --> 12:22.200]  have marched her right into the doctor's office and shot her up, so I wanted to thank you
[12:22.200 --> 12:26.200]  for that. Keep up the good work, Alex. You're doing great, and I think more and more people,
[12:26.200 --> 12:31.200]  as time goes on, as bad as things get, are not looking at this as a crazy conspiracy,
[12:31.200 --> 12:33.200]  and they're saying, hey, maybe there's something there.
[12:33.200 --> 12:37.200]  Well, once you figure out there's a global government and a global scientific dictatorship
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.200]  and you read their own army reports, their own white papers, their own university papers,
[12:42.200 --> 12:48.200]  it's all there. I'm not even analyzing or bringing you this great revelation myself.
[12:48.200 --> 12:54.200]  They have declared total war on humanity, and on the subject of government-sponsored terror,
[12:54.200 --> 13:00.200]  in the last nine months, it's come out declassified that, yes, Israel premeditatedly
[13:00.200 --> 13:05.200]  attacked the U.S.S. liberty to try to sink it to blaming on Egypt. It has come out that Dick Cheney
[13:05.200 --> 13:12.200]  wanted to have Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians in fake Iranian patrol boats and attack U.S. ships.
[13:12.200 --> 13:20.200]  I mean, it's all coming out. We're telling the truth. We know the score. We know what's going on.
[13:20.200 --> 13:25.200]  And we are beginning to win the Info War, but believe me, the enemy's going to counterattack.
[13:25.200 --> 13:29.200]  And whether that's going after people in the truth movement or staging more terror attacks
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.200]  or all of the above or releasing a bio-weapon, God only knows.
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.200]  We just have to do the right thing and get the word out. Jai, I appreciate your call.
[13:37.200 --> 13:43.200]  And on the subject of babies and vaccines, we put out the information,
[13:43.200 --> 13:47.200]  and then it's up to you to decide if you're going to put your child in a government training camp,
[13:47.200 --> 13:52.200]  where they turn you, your family against each other, where they turn your children against you,
[13:52.200 --> 13:57.200]  where they try to get them into the prison system, where they try to lie and force vaccines on you.
[13:57.200 --> 14:04.200]  It's up to you to go read the drug insert on the HPV, human papilloma live virus shot
[14:04.200 --> 14:09.200]  and find out how many people it's killed and find out that it says it doesn't protect you from the cancer
[14:09.200 --> 14:14.200]  and actually gives you a 45% increase in getting the cancer if you already happen to have the virus.
[14:14.200 --> 14:18.200]  I mean, that's there. It's up to you before you go on Prozac.
[14:18.200 --> 14:22.200]  If you're in a car wreck now, your insurance company tries to put you on Prozac.
[14:22.200 --> 14:27.200]  They want us drugged out. It's up to you to go read that the serotonin reuptake inhibitor family
[14:27.200 --> 14:31.200]  massively increases psychotic breaks, suicide, violent actions.
[14:31.200 --> 14:37.200]  I mean, it's up to you to go verify what I'm telling you and then make your own decision.
[14:37.200 --> 14:41.200]  In a perfect world, could they make clean vaccines that would help children?
[14:41.200 --> 14:46.200]  There's a lot of dangers associated with it, even if it's done right.
[14:46.200 --> 14:52.200]  But with what they're doing by design trying to hurt you, I mean, who would give it to their children?
[14:52.200 --> 14:57.200]  Does that mean your child might actually get an earache?
[14:57.200 --> 15:01.200]  You know, they have vaccines for that, but they've had to recall them.
[15:01.200 --> 15:07.200]  Could in a perfect world it help? Maybe. Could a flu shot in a perfect world help you? Maybe.
[15:07.200 --> 15:11.200]  But here's an example. Don't believe me. I demand you look it up for yourself.
[15:11.200 --> 15:16.200]  Last time I checked about a year ago, the last five years in a row,
[15:16.200 --> 15:26.200]  they had guesstimated with dead reckoning a year before what the dominant flu would be in the United States and Canada.
[15:26.200 --> 15:35.200]  And in the five years previous, they missed it entirely and people went out and took a flu shot that didn't even protect them from that year's flu.
[15:35.200 --> 15:38.200]  Because they have to guess how it's going to mutate.
[15:38.200 --> 15:44.200]  So right there, it doesn't even protect you because the last five years in a row, and I haven't checked in a year.
[15:44.200 --> 15:48.200]  I don't know if they got it right this year. I guess I can look it up right now.
[15:48.200 --> 15:51.200]  But again, the average person doesn't know how a vaccine works.
[15:51.200 --> 15:58.200]  They don't know that there's all these federal studies that if you take three flu shots, it doubles your chance of getting Alzheimer's.
[15:58.200 --> 16:04.200]  Don't believe me. Just Google that. Type flu shot Alzheimer's into Google. Pull it up.
[16:04.200 --> 16:08.200]  In fact, let's just do that right now. I said I'd take hundreds of calls, but that's just too important.
[16:08.200 --> 16:14.200]  You know, I'll do it during a break and then later I'll give you a mainstream article on that.
[16:14.200 --> 16:18.200]  Just to prove. People will say, all right, Google that and couldn't find it. Well, we'll see.
[16:18.200 --> 16:22.200]  Let's talk to Steve in Texas. Steve, you're on the air.
[16:22.200 --> 16:23.200]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[16:23.200 --> 16:25.200]  Fire it up, my friend.
[16:25.200 --> 16:36.200]  Hey, I've recently heard that the Ministry of Japan had turned over the production of their yen to the same people who own our federal reserve system.
[16:36.200 --> 16:43.200]  And when asked why he did that, he said that they had been threatened with an earthquake-making machine.
[16:43.200 --> 16:46.200]  I didn't see that. Was that the mainstream story?
[16:46.200 --> 16:51.200]  No, I just picked that story up on the Internet, but I thought, well, here's the problem.
[16:51.200 --> 16:59.200]  The biggest problem we face is our own movement. Just because the mainstream media spins and lies and gets things wrong and sometimes gets it right,
[16:59.200 --> 17:05.200]  because they're not all government operatives, stuff slips through, doesn't mean that the alternative media is telling the truth.
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.200]  And there is just so much insanity out there on the web.
[17:09.200 --> 17:16.200]  I agree, but I wanted to prove if there wasn't an earthquake-making machine.
[17:16.200 --> 17:29.200]  So I went to USGS.gov, looked at patterns in earthquakes and how they've been coming up and see if I can recognize any proof that there is an earthquake machine.
[17:29.200 --> 17:38.200]  And it seems like I have the proof. The tsunami that killed all those people, the earthquake recently in China.
[17:38.200 --> 17:46.200]  Yes, the age newspaper in Australia did report a secret government program for a, quote, tsunami bomb.
[17:46.200 --> 17:53.200]  And all of these earthquakes all originate from 10 kilometers under the Earth's surface.
[17:53.200 --> 18:01.200]  And when you look at that 10 kilometers and you look, you can see they're using the Earth as target practice.
[18:01.200 --> 18:11.200]  Well, there are a lot of real earthquakes, and I appreciate your call, but there are government documents and mainstream news reports of seismic tectonic weapons.
[18:11.200 --> 18:20.200]  But they're so classified that I don't even really cover them other than some of the declassified stuff from decades ago where they had developed it.
[18:20.200 --> 18:38.200]  Well, in the April issue of Army Times in 1997, they covered a Pentagon press conference by Secretary of Defense William Cohen, where he stated, you can pull this quote up, just type,
[18:38.200 --> 18:52.200]  William Cohen, quote, on earthquake weapons, and it'll pop up mainstream news. And he said, states have developed tectonic earthquake weapons, and this is one of the greatest threats we face.
[18:52.200 --> 18:58.200]  So Army Times, I just gave you the date of the magazine.
[18:58.200 --> 19:09.200]  And they have a magazine and a newspaper, and I'm going back 11 years, but I know it was, it was, it was in Army Times and it was in April of 1997.
[19:09.200 --> 19:22.200]  I know it was in the magazine of the newspaper, but April and 97 pops up and I can pretty much quote his, he talked about weather weapons and tectonic earthquake weapons that he said could dwarf the power of nuclear weapons.
[19:22.200 --> 19:24.200]  That's a paraphrase quote.
[19:24.200 --> 19:43.200]  Say what I'll do, I'll show you the power of Google. During the break, I will try to pull up the correlation between flu shots and Alzheimer's and the William Cohen tectonic weapon quote.
[19:43.200 --> 19:53.200]  Okay, we'll show you how we document here. We'll be right back.
[19:53.200 --> 20:03.200]  That enters from minus August 6, 2008 gold 880 40 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 906 17446 40 for half 223 20 for quarter.
[20:03.200 --> 20:12.200]  That's 906 17446 40 and 223 20 hedge funds cut in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies. The bond market continues to slump.
[20:12.200 --> 20:23.200]  J.P. Morgan gets caught in a 10 billion bad deal for Chrysler housing sales fell 6.6%. Mortgage giant countrywide showed mortgage payment was spreading to the middle and upper class.
[20:23.200 --> 20:30.200]  Investors cast out on investment banks credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders or skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[20:30.200 --> 20:37.200]  The U.S. dollar is free falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S. are now seeking safer alternatives.
[20:37.200 --> 20:50.200]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report bubble leaking call for the report today 806 8 6 223 7 the value of your hard earned money is being lost in a global game of chess call 806 8 6 223 7.
[20:50.200 --> 20:53.200]  That's 806 8 6 223 7.
[20:53.200 --> 21:07.200]  Everybody's attention, please. I've come with a message of information. 9 11 was an inside job. You like being a puppet, sir? You like being a puppet from the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9 11 was a stage was engineered by you?
[21:07.200 --> 21:10.200]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[21:10.200 --> 21:19.200]  The data we stop asking questions is the data that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[21:19.200 --> 21:25.200]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[21:25.200 --> 21:29.200]  An inside job? How dare you?
[21:29.200 --> 21:35.200]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[21:35.200 --> 21:38.200]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[21:38.200 --> 21:44.200]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.

[24:01.200 --> 24:09.200]  OK, I googled flu shots Alzheimer's, found hundreds of mainstream news articles.
[24:09.200 --> 24:17.200]  There's a Global Advisor Committee on Vaccine Safety says not only increase in Alzheimer's, they list a bunch of studies.
[24:17.200 --> 24:19.200]  This is the first link, this is on Markola.
[24:19.200 --> 24:22.200]  Dr. Markola said he's got links to all the mainstream news.
[24:22.200 --> 24:23.200]  It's the first link.
[24:23.200 --> 24:26.200]  A Global Advisor Committee on Vaccine Safety.
[24:26.200 --> 24:32.200]  Also, they report a massive increase in Bell palsy following immunization with the vaccine.
[24:32.200 --> 24:35.200]  It's tied into muster called dystrophy.
[24:35.200 --> 24:39.200]  Go on and read the FDA report on that.
[24:39.200 --> 24:41.200]  That was a short break.
[24:41.200 --> 24:45.200]  Then I googled William Cohen Weather Weapons.
[24:45.200 --> 24:51.200]  And the first link was fas.org.
[24:51.200 --> 24:54.200]  And I also found a bunch of Pentagon sites.
[24:54.200 --> 25:02.200]  And I have found the full transcript of what he had to say, but we ran out of time for me to find the actual quote in there.
[25:02.200 --> 25:13.200]  But I remember this. It's Cohen addresses 428 at conference on terrorism, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, U.S. strategy, Sam Nunn policy forum, April 28th, 97.
[25:13.200 --> 25:14.200]  You see my memory?
[25:14.200 --> 25:19.200]  I told you April Army Times because they then ended up reporting on this.
[25:19.200 --> 25:21.200]  It must have been the 29th or 30th.
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.200]  My memory says the 30th was the Army Times newspaper.
[25:25.200 --> 25:30.200]  But I am on the Federation of American Scientists right now.
[25:30.200 --> 25:31.200]  You know what? This is only five pages.
[25:31.200 --> 25:34.200]  Maybe I'll just read the whole thing and you will see that we'll run into it.
[25:34.200 --> 25:37.200]  Secretary Cohen, Secretary Nunn, thank you very much.
[25:37.200 --> 25:43.200]  As Senator Nunn has indicated, he and I have worked for many years together along with Senator Luger.
[25:43.200 --> 25:51.200]  The two of these gentlemen I feel are perhaps the most courageous and visionary to have served in the Senate.
[25:51.200 --> 25:52.200]  Let me skip ahead.
[25:52.200 --> 26:00.200]  I comment on the latter during the conference of the morning, but I've had occasion to meet with a number of Russian counterparts as we go through the various transactions.
[26:00.200 --> 26:02.200]  Let me skip ahead.
[26:02.200 --> 26:03.200]  Another paragraph.
[26:03.200 --> 26:04.200]  It was Nunn Luger.
[26:04.200 --> 26:09.200]  I tried to do keyword searches, control left, but I couldn't find it in the 60 seconds I had.
[26:09.200 --> 26:22.200]  That I dealt with in the reduction of nuclear weapons between the United States and Soviet Union in terms of trying to come to grips with who helped the dismantle hundreds of Russian nuclear weapons.
[26:22.200 --> 26:29.200]  He says we're involved in helping local states with local agencies to deal with the threat of terrorism, which is quite likely to increase in the coming years.
[26:29.200 --> 26:33.200]  It is a pleasure for me to be here, both Senator Nunn and Senator Luger, close friends.
[26:33.200 --> 26:36.200]  Senator Nunn, thank you very much, Bill.
[26:36.200 --> 26:39.200]  Let me ask if there are any questions from Secretary of Defense Cohen.
[26:39.200 --> 26:45.200]  The dual containment policy in Iran and Iraq, do you think that's conclusive to regional stability in the region?
[26:45.200 --> 26:50.200]  I think Secretary Albright articulated our policy as far as dealing with Iraq, okay?
[26:50.200 --> 26:53.200]  I've got to find the weapons areas.
[26:53.200 --> 26:57.200]  With respect to Iran, I think he continues to present long-term threats to the region.
[26:57.200 --> 27:03.200]  What does it mean for the Clinton and Honorable proliferation to the extent of communication available?
[27:03.200 --> 27:06.200]  We've seen by way, this is what it's like to research, folks.
[27:06.200 --> 27:07.200]  You've got to do it.
[27:07.200 --> 27:17.200]  We've seen by way of example the World Trade Center, the International Aspects of International Terrorism, coming to home territory, about the first bombing in 93.
[27:17.200 --> 27:24.200]  How to prepare the U.S. government to deal with an Honorable, I think we have to really intensify our efforts.
[27:24.200 --> 27:30.200]  I've got to find the part. I know it's in here, maybe in a sub-page.
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.200]  Nature of the threat, some kind of chemical weapon, biological one.
[27:35.200 --> 27:45.200]  There are some reports, for example, that some countries have been trying to construct something like Ebola virus that would be very dangerous phenomenon to say the least.
[27:45.200 --> 27:55.200]  Alvin Toffler, who's written about this in terms of some scientist in the laboratory, is trying to create race-specific bio-weapons to eliminate certain ethnic groups.
[27:55.200 --> 28:01.200]  And Dick Cheney, by the way, called for this in the September 20, 2000 PNAC document.
[28:01.200 --> 28:02.200]  I'm just adding that.
[28:02.200 --> 28:04.200]  And others, see the kind of stuff you read in these things?
[28:04.200 --> 28:11.200]  That are designating some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops.
[28:11.200 --> 28:21.200]  Others are engaging even in an eco type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, shut off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[28:21.200 --> 28:23.200]  Ah, see, that's how you do it.
[28:23.200 --> 28:26.200]  Don't tell me you can't find this.
[28:26.200 --> 28:29.200]  People all over the web saying I make up weather weapon information.
[28:29.200 --> 28:37.200]  We interviewed the father of weather weapons meteorologist Ben Livingston.
[28:37.200 --> 28:41.200]  By the way, that's up on prisonplanet.tv, the exclusive. We flew him to town to interview him.
[28:41.200 --> 28:43.200]  We never put it in the film. We're just too busy.
[28:43.200 --> 28:47.200]  I mean, it was all declassified three years ago, so we could then finally interview him.
[28:47.200 --> 28:49.200]  And that's what I do. It was declassified.
[28:49.200 --> 28:52.200]  So I called the top scientist up, flew him to Austin.
[28:52.200 --> 28:55.200]  He lives in Midland, Texas, and had him on.
[28:55.200 --> 28:57.200]  But the point is, we're not making this up.
[28:57.200 --> 29:00.200]  This is Federation of American Scientists.
[29:00.200 --> 29:06.200]  And it starts in the paragraph that says, well, you can just control left.
[29:06.200 --> 29:10.200]  Electromagnetic or control F waves.
[29:10.200 --> 29:15.200]  Just hit control F when you're on the page and it'll take you right to the quote.
[29:15.200 --> 29:18.200]  So there, I just showed you right there.
[29:18.200 --> 29:21.200]  It's not hard. I'm not that smart.
[29:21.200 --> 29:23.200]  I told you April 97.
[29:23.200 --> 29:28.200]  Just like cops when I tell you they're injecting you in the military with cancer virus vaccines.
[29:28.200 --> 29:31.200]  You want me to pull that up right now during the next three-minute break?
[29:31.200 --> 29:33.200]  You want me to?
[29:33.200 --> 29:37.200]  You want me to shove it in your face? How they're killing us?
[29:37.200 --> 29:42.200]  We're going to come back and take your call. Stay with me.
[29:42.200 --> 29:46.200]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:46.200 --> 29:52.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:52.200 --> 29:59.200]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[29:59.200 --> 30:04.200]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[30:04.200 --> 30:09.200]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.

[30:27.200 --> 30:33.200]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[30:33.200 --> 30:38.200]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[30:52.200 --> 30:58.200]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[30:58.200 --> 31:00.200]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[31:00.200 --> 31:03.200]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[31:03.200 --> 31:09.200]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[31:09.200 --> 31:13.200]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[32:19.200 --> 32:23.200]  Tell to rich men rule the world in secret right now.
[32:23.200 --> 32:27.200]  But we'll openly rule it very soon.
[32:27.200 --> 32:30.200]  Is this what Americans want?
[32:30.200 --> 32:33.200]  Then we need to repent before our God.
[32:33.200 --> 32:42.200]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[32:42.200 --> 32:53.200]  This call our toll free number 1-800-516-8736.
[32:53.200 --> 32:59.200]  Big John. Big John.
[32:59.200 --> 33:02.200]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[33:02.200 --> 33:08.200]  He stood six foot six and waited 245 kind of broad at his shoulder and there at the hip.
[33:08.200 --> 33:12.200]  Everybody knew you didn't give no lift to Big John.
[33:12.200 --> 33:18.200]  Big John. Big John.
[33:18.200 --> 33:24.200]  Big Bad John. Big John.
[33:24.200 --> 33:27.200]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[33:27.200 --> 33:30.200]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[33:30.200 --> 33:33.200]  Didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy.
[33:33.200 --> 33:36.200]  But if he spoke it out he just said hi to Big John.
[33:36.200 --> 33:38.200]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls right now.
[33:38.200 --> 33:41.200]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans.
[33:41.200 --> 33:44.200]  There are literally hundreds of articles out this week.
[33:44.200 --> 33:49.200]  Mainstream news about the Gardasil shot paralyzing and killing people.
[33:49.200 --> 33:53.200]  The live HPV live cancer virus shot that actually gives you cancer.
[33:53.200 --> 33:55.200]  Go read their own insert.
[33:55.200 --> 34:01.200]  You ever listen to these drug ads where they'll start whispering real fast and talking like an auctioneer at the end of the ad.
[34:01.200 --> 34:07.200]  It causes heart attacks, deaths, and a list of 100 things.
[34:07.200 --> 34:11.200]  It'll say having trouble, having trouble having to go to the bathroom too much, we'll take this.
[34:11.200 --> 34:13.200]  And at the end there are 20 horrible things it does.
[34:13.200 --> 34:16.200]  But if you go read the actual insert, it'll list 100.
[34:16.200 --> 34:19.200]  Sometimes it'll list 200.
[34:19.200 --> 34:24.200]  Well, we told you a year ago.
[34:24.200 --> 34:33.200]  In mid-2007, it was authorized the trials of just, what was it?
[34:33.200 --> 34:39.200]  Memory, 1600 people out of 1600 people.
[34:39.200 --> 34:41.200]  And this is with the CDC reporting.
[34:41.200 --> 34:47.200]  And with a new drug, it's about one out of 40 is the thumb rule with a new drug because they don't know how to report it.
[34:47.200 --> 34:48.200]  It doesn't get reported correctly.
[34:48.200 --> 34:53.200]  With an already developed on-the-shelf drug for years, only one in 10 adverse drug reactions.
[34:53.200 --> 34:55.200]  You can go pull that up in handbooks if you'd like.
[34:55.200 --> 34:56.200]  It gets reported.
[34:56.200 --> 34:57.200]  So let's see.
[34:57.200 --> 35:04.200]  If one out of 40 on average were being reported out of 1600 trial subjects and three died.
[35:04.200 --> 35:06.200]  So let's say it was 40 times worse than that.
[35:06.200 --> 35:10.200]  What's 40 times three?
[35:10.200 --> 35:17.200]  That would mean by rule of thumb it really killed 120 people out of 1600 in the trial test.
[35:17.200 --> 35:23.200]  No matter, let's say it killed three out of 1600 and paralyzed hundreds of others.
[35:23.200 --> 35:26.200]  Oh, joy.
[35:26.200 --> 35:35.200]  Well, here it is telling you a year after it was put on the market and hundreds of thousands of girls have gone out and taken it.
[35:35.200 --> 35:37.200]  Because mommy heard it cures cancer.
[35:37.200 --> 35:38.200]  It'll stop my daughter.
[35:38.200 --> 35:41.200]  Most of these idiots, you hear them on the news, think it stops breast cancer, everything else.
[35:41.200 --> 35:46.200]  No, it targets four to six strains, depending on their several versions of the vaccine of over 350.
[35:46.200 --> 35:48.200]  Strains of human papillomavirus.
[35:48.200 --> 35:52.200]  Is HPV vaccine to blame for teens paralysis?
[35:52.200 --> 35:54.200]  U.S. News and World Report.
[35:54.200 --> 35:56.200]  And it goes into whitewashing everything.
[35:56.200 --> 35:58.200]  But if you go read the actual reports, it's far worse.
[35:58.200 --> 35:59.200]  Kind of news I have.
[35:59.200 --> 36:00.200]  Okay.
[36:00.200 --> 36:01.200]  I said I go to your calls.
[36:01.200 --> 36:02.200]  Brendan and Denver, you're on the air.
[36:02.200 --> 36:03.200]  Go ahead.
[36:03.200 --> 36:04.200]  Alex, man.
[36:04.200 --> 36:05.200]  It's good to talk to you.
[36:05.200 --> 36:06.200]  Good to talk to you.
[36:06.200 --> 36:08.200]  Um, I don't know.
[36:08.200 --> 36:13.200]  I think I reached a point last week where I just don't know what to do.
[36:13.200 --> 36:19.200]  After watching that video, you posted with the two cops beating the other cop.
[36:19.200 --> 36:21.200]  And he broke the other guy's leg.
[36:21.200 --> 36:22.200]  You remember that?
[36:22.200 --> 36:23.200]  There's so many.
[36:23.200 --> 36:27.200]  I mean, there's so many cops killing people, attacking, going crazy.
[36:27.200 --> 36:28.200]  I don't know.
[36:28.200 --> 36:36.200]  Well, what's going to make change besides a nationwide call to arms?
[36:36.200 --> 36:40.200]  Everybody that always calls for arms, they never go out and start shooting.
[36:40.200 --> 36:42.200]  And by the way, I don't think you should.
[36:42.200 --> 36:47.200]  No, look, killing police and military is exactly what the new world order wants.
[36:47.200 --> 36:53.200]  They want to go ahead and bring us into bedlam so they can shut the food supply off and cause
[36:53.200 --> 36:56.200]  even bigger rioting and then everything settled down.
[36:56.200 --> 36:58.200]  They can come in and play the part of the saviors.
[36:58.200 --> 36:59.200]  We don't want violence.
[36:59.200 --> 37:03.200]  And I'm not saying you, but the talk show hosts and others that are always calling for it.
[37:03.200 --> 37:05.200]  Notice they're never out doing it themselves.
[37:05.200 --> 37:06.200]  Right.
[37:06.200 --> 37:08.200]  Um, one more thing.
[37:08.200 --> 37:10.200]  Mm hmm.
[37:10.200 --> 37:11.200]  Brendan, go ahead.
[37:11.200 --> 37:12.200]  Yeah.
[37:12.200 --> 37:16.200]  Um, have you thought about having Naomi Klein back or Naomi Wolfe back on there?
[37:16.200 --> 37:20.200]  You know, I've had her on twice and because she was coming out with the 10 steps of fascism.
[37:20.200 --> 37:23.200]  She had mentioned gun control being one of the big ones.
[37:23.200 --> 37:29.200]  And, uh, you know, uh, I don't completely agree with everything she's saying or doing.
[37:29.200 --> 37:31.200]  I think two visits is enough from her.
[37:31.200 --> 37:33.200]  I mean, would you like to hear back on?
[37:33.200 --> 37:38.200]  I'll just maybe to get her take with the election coming up because I know she's saying in her
[37:38.200 --> 37:40.200]  book, um, it's a very unstable time.
[37:40.200 --> 37:45.200]  And I know, I mean, something's right around the way.
[37:45.200 --> 37:48.200]  Well, maybe we'll have her on.
[37:48.200 --> 37:49.200]  I appreciate your call.
[37:49.200 --> 37:52.200]  Um, let's go ahead and take another call.
[37:52.200 --> 37:56.200]  Jim in Florida, you're on the air.
[37:56.200 --> 37:57.200]  Come ahead, Jim.
[37:57.200 --> 37:58.200]  You're, you're up.
[37:58.200 --> 37:59.200]  You're on stage.
[37:59.200 --> 38:01.200]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[38:01.200 --> 38:02.200]  Good.
[38:02.200 --> 38:05.200]  Hey, listen, uh, I, I'm being a buddy of mine here.
[38:05.200 --> 38:09.200]  We're both contractors in Florida and jobs here like scarce.
[38:09.200 --> 38:15.200]  I mean, I used to make 250,000 a year and I'll be lucky to make 40 this year.
[38:15.200 --> 38:18.200]  So, I mean, the, the jobs are real bad here.
[38:18.200 --> 38:19.200]  And, uh,
[38:19.200 --> 38:22.200]  But George Bush says the economy's wonderful and he doesn't lie.
[38:22.200 --> 38:26.200]  There were WMDs in Iraq and the government loves you and take your shots.
[38:26.200 --> 38:27.200]  Everything's fine.
[38:27.200 --> 38:28.200]  I mean, there's so much stuff going on here.
[38:28.200 --> 38:33.200]  I see there was a, a roadblock right down the street from my house's sheriff's department
[38:33.200 --> 38:35.200]  and they were just pulling people over left and right.
[38:35.200 --> 38:40.200]  Yeah, meanwhile, every month or so they kill cops on the border and the media covers it up.
[38:40.200 --> 38:42.200]  And again, I mean, we're scared.
[38:42.200 --> 38:43.200]  We're scared for our family.
[38:43.200 --> 38:44.200]  I mean, I'm 40 years old.
[38:44.200 --> 38:45.200]  I got kids.
[38:45.200 --> 38:47.200]  You've got kids and we're scared.
[38:47.200 --> 38:48.200]  Well, listen, listen, what do we do?
[38:48.200 --> 38:50.200]  I mean, what, what, what are people going to do?
[38:50.200 --> 38:52.200]  I mean, listen, I've been listening for 10 years.
[38:52.200 --> 38:53.200]  Okay.
[38:53.200 --> 38:55.200]  And I've known about this forever.
[38:55.200 --> 38:56.200]  Okay.
[38:56.200 --> 38:58.200]  I prepared myself for it.
[38:58.200 --> 38:59.200]  Okay.
[38:59.200 --> 39:00.200]  I'm stuck with my house right now.
[39:00.200 --> 39:03.200]  What can I do besides call my congressman?
[39:03.200 --> 39:05.200]  I mean, what are they doing?
[39:05.200 --> 39:06.200]  Okay.
[39:06.200 --> 39:07.200]  I'll tell you what you do.
[39:07.200 --> 39:08.200]  I'll tell you what you do.
[39:08.200 --> 39:12.200]  You buy an FM transmitter, a hundred water.
[39:12.200 --> 39:16.200]  It's only like a thousand bucks and you plug that sucker in, you do it right in the right
[39:16.200 --> 39:20.200]  cable on the right antenna and you run GCN or you run my show out locally.
[39:20.200 --> 39:21.920]  It's not on the local station.
[39:21.920 --> 39:24.200]  That's how big of an emergency we're in.
[39:24.200 --> 39:30.500]  You, you, you buy a used copy machine and sheet paper and you print out one page flyers
[39:30.500 --> 39:31.700]  about the new world order.
[39:31.700 --> 39:37.120]  And if everybody just of this show did that, we would be knee deep in DVDs and flyers and
[39:37.120 --> 39:39.920]  info and you just keep waking people up.
[39:39.920 --> 39:43.840]  Finally folks are listening and all I can say is that the general public knows they're
[39:43.840 --> 39:45.160]  being lied to now.
[39:45.160 --> 39:46.720]  They just don't understand the full picture.
[39:46.720 --> 39:50.520]  Now for those police, we're under a national emergency.
[39:50.520 --> 39:52.900]  I've had congressmen on here to cover that.
[39:52.900 --> 39:59.200]  They are, this is martial law checkpoints from San Diego to Tampa from Dallas, Texas
[39:59.200 --> 40:01.040]  to, to you name it.
[40:01.040 --> 40:05.440]  They are running random checkpoint, searching citizens, blocking down neighborhoods, using
[40:05.440 --> 40:09.320]  national guard for gun confiscation from Illinois to DC.
[40:09.320 --> 40:11.440]  Brother, we're going into martial law.
[40:11.440 --> 40:14.520]  They're just turning the heat up exactly as we said they would.
[40:14.520 --> 40:18.880]  And it's clear that they're getting ready for a big move and that probably is releasing
[40:18.880 --> 40:22.320]  a bio weapon so they can pose as saviors.
[40:22.320 --> 40:28.120]  It's probably, you know, setting off a nuke, starting a war, heaven knows sir, murdering
[40:28.120 --> 40:29.880]  psychos are in control.
[40:29.880 --> 40:33.480]  They got a bunch of dumbed down idiots in government thinking they're God.
[40:33.480 --> 40:35.240]  They've doubled and then tripled the police.
[40:35.240 --> 40:37.520]  So they've got to raise money somehow.
[40:37.520 --> 40:40.840]  So they're going to run checkpoints and this is it.
[40:40.840 --> 40:42.240]  This is the predatory state.
[40:42.240 --> 40:43.240]  This is it.
[40:43.240 --> 40:44.240]  And it's only going to get worse.
[40:44.240 --> 40:46.120]  The economy is only going to get worse.
[40:46.120 --> 40:47.120]  Things are only going to get worse.
[40:47.120 --> 40:49.920]  CPS is only going to kidnap more children.
[40:49.920 --> 40:51.000]  There's nowhere to run.
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.240]  Every nation's clamping down.
[40:52.240 --> 40:58.640]  It's world government run by psychopathic eugenicist.
[40:58.640 --> 41:00.240]  That's why I'm freaking out brother.
[41:00.240 --> 41:04.440]  There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, no way out and you can't even sell your house
[41:04.440 --> 41:05.440]  or nothing.
[41:05.440 --> 41:06.440]  The market's ridiculous.
[41:06.440 --> 41:07.440]  Absolutely.
[41:07.440 --> 41:08.440]  Absolutely.
[41:08.440 --> 41:10.960]  It's a hell pit.
[41:10.960 --> 41:11.960]  It's a hell pit.
[41:11.960 --> 41:12.960]  Sir.
[41:12.960 --> 41:13.960]  It's the new world order.
[41:13.960 --> 41:14.960]  And listen, I appreciate your call.
[41:14.960 --> 41:16.060]  Let me, let me explain something.
[41:16.060 --> 41:18.480]  You think it's bad now folks.
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.840]  The people running our country killed more than 60 million in Russia.
[41:23.840 --> 41:27.400]  They killed more than 40 million with world war two total.
[41:27.400 --> 41:32.760]  They declassified the engineered that the millner group out of England.
[41:32.760 --> 41:38.560]  They hired now to kill 60 million now declassify the CIA put him in.
[41:38.560 --> 41:44.160]  In fact, after the boxer rebellion, British intelligence created, that's mainstream news.
[41:44.160 --> 41:52.160]  I bought a eighth grade history book for like $6 at a Barnes and Noble on the discount
[41:52.160 --> 41:53.160]  table a month ago.
[41:53.160 --> 42:00.280]  I finally read it to my son Monday night and I was blown away as I was reading him this
[42:00.280 --> 42:07.760]  history book that it was accurate and said that the British intelligence created the
[42:07.760 --> 42:15.080]  Communist party out of the boxer rebellion out of the armistice treaty with the central
[42:15.080 --> 42:19.560]  government of China and that then later it admitted basically backed Mao.
[42:19.560 --> 42:24.720]  I mean, it's even mainstream eighth grade picture books.
[42:24.720 --> 42:27.200]  It's so sick.
[42:27.200 --> 42:28.440]  It's so sick.
[42:28.440 --> 42:36.160]  I mean, what he wrote it in two bucks, but memory serves.
[42:36.160 --> 42:41.080]  I could, I could Google right now.
[42:41.080 --> 42:44.920]  I could Google right now is a big number of Zinsky.
[42:44.920 --> 42:49.040]  I was a national security advisor, Barack Obama's Obama's advisor now.
[42:49.040 --> 42:58.640]  I could Google, you do this, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Cambodia quotes or Camaroge quotes or Pol Pot
[42:58.640 --> 43:05.720]  quotes and you will read that son of a bitch saying that the US government backed Pol Pot
[43:05.720 --> 43:07.640]  and back the murder of two million.
[43:07.640 --> 43:16.600]  That bastard and that word is not strong enough that he is bragging about his bones.
[43:16.600 --> 43:20.200]  Do you think gang members brag about bones shooting or killing a few people?
[43:20.200 --> 43:23.160]  Well, criminals are the same in the world over.
[43:23.160 --> 43:30.560]  He brags about his bones and that's why when he walks on a new order stage, kings and queens
[43:30.560 --> 43:38.280]  look at him with admiration because he's made his bones two million deep.
[43:38.280 --> 43:43.280]  Not to mention precipitating the Russians and attacking the Russians through the Al-Ciada
[43:43.280 --> 43:51.400]  in 79, six months before they invaded to suck the Russians into Afghanistan.
[43:51.400 --> 43:52.880]  He made his bones.
[43:52.880 --> 43:56.920]  That's who we're dealing with.
[43:56.920 --> 44:02.960]  I'm going to tell you cops and military and FBI and all of you to serve the system.
[44:02.960 --> 44:05.280]  You're going to laugh at me and you're not going to listen, but when this country is
[44:05.280 --> 44:11.200]  destitute and bankrupt and when you and your whole family are dying young, a soft kill
[44:11.200 --> 44:17.640]  weapons, your boss is injected into you, just remember a real American warned you and did
[44:17.640 --> 44:22.360]  everything they could to try to be your brother and to try to get you to face the truth, but
[44:22.360 --> 44:26.720]  you wouldn't do it.
[44:26.720 --> 44:27.720]  More calls?
[44:27.720 --> 44:34.000]  Jim, I understand you're concerned, but the only thing we can hope for is to fully discredit
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.600]  the government now is to have the government basically stand down, to have the minions
[44:38.600 --> 44:44.760]  stop being minions and to just let the country collapse and go into a depression and then
[44:44.760 --> 44:48.520]  expose government sponsored terror to such a point that they just stopped doing that
[44:48.520 --> 44:53.480]  and the government can only try to hang on.
[44:53.480 --> 45:00.120]  That's the best thing we can hope for as a stalemate right now.
[45:00.120 --> 45:01.120]  Okay?
[45:01.120 --> 45:05.680]  I mean, you better hope the worst you're going to get is ending up having to move in with
[45:05.680 --> 45:08.240]  your parents.
[45:08.240 --> 45:16.200]  You better hope the worst you're going to have to deal with is the U.S. becoming a third
[45:16.200 --> 45:22.440]  world country because if they do what they want to do and I've had former White House
[45:22.440 --> 45:29.320]  chief analyst and historians on and just CIA top analyst, I've just had scores of experts
[45:29.320 --> 45:34.600]  on and they all agree from Richard C. Cook to Ray McGovern running the gamut that the
[45:34.600 --> 45:40.400]  elite is preparing a mass extermination up like we saw in Nazi Germany or Russia or China
[45:40.400 --> 45:43.080]  or 100 plus other countries.
[45:43.080 --> 45:47.520]  Iran, they're planning the same stuff here.
[45:47.520 --> 45:50.120]  Thank God we have a history of the Second Amendment.
[45:50.120 --> 45:54.480]  Thank God they are, no matter what they try, going to be unable to get all the guns out
[45:54.480 --> 45:55.480]  of our hands.
[45:55.480 --> 45:57.240]  That is the ace in the hole.
[45:57.240 --> 46:00.240]  That is Valhalla to our movement.
[46:00.240 --> 46:05.440]  That is everything, ladies and gentlemen, is those guns and the fact that the elite
[46:05.440 --> 46:11.360]  knows they can't move too quick because if they get into too hot a war too fast, they
[46:11.360 --> 46:15.400]  will be defeated.
[46:15.400 --> 46:17.520]  But then things will collapse into something horrible.
[46:17.520 --> 46:20.120]  I don't even want that, folks.
[46:20.120 --> 46:21.520]  It's easy to shoot your mouth off.
[46:21.520 --> 46:26.400]  The last thing I want is dead cops and dead FBI and dead military.
[46:26.400 --> 46:28.360]  It will help the New World Order to do that.
[46:28.360 --> 46:32.200]  We do not want that.
[46:32.200 --> 46:36.080]  That is the last thing we want, but they are going to push and their bosses are going to
[46:36.080 --> 46:39.680]  push them into that.
[46:39.680 --> 46:40.680]  Heaven help us.
[46:40.680 --> 46:41.680]  Chris in Virginia, you're on the year.
[46:41.680 --> 46:42.680]  Yeah, Alex.
[46:42.680 --> 46:43.680]  Thanks for taking my call.
[46:43.680 --> 46:50.280]  I want to talk a little bit about how the military industrial complex has totally taken
[46:50.280 --> 46:52.760]  over agriculture in this country.
[46:52.760 --> 46:53.760]  Yep.
[46:53.760 --> 46:58.960]  And what people need to realize is that after World War II, all these petrochemical factories
[46:58.960 --> 47:01.480]  that were making bombs and weapons.
[47:01.480 --> 47:04.640]  They shifted to chemical fertilizer that destroyed the soil.
[47:04.640 --> 47:05.640]  That is exactly it.
[47:05.640 --> 47:08.480]  By design, we have all the declassified reports on that.
[47:08.480 --> 47:09.640]  Yes, sir.
[47:09.640 --> 47:13.760]  And the best thing to grow with the petrochemical fertilizers is corn.
[47:13.760 --> 47:21.120]  So now we have all this farmland growing corn that people can't even eat to grow beef that's
[47:21.120 --> 47:25.540]  not even healthy for people to eat, then we have to get a produce from other countries
[47:25.540 --> 47:28.760]  where it's tainted with fecal matter.
[47:28.760 --> 47:29.760]  It's totally insane.
[47:29.760 --> 47:36.080]  So I want to tell everybody out there they can go to localharvest.org and check out the
[47:36.080 --> 47:41.360]  local farmers in your area, go to farmers markets, join a CSA.
[47:41.360 --> 47:46.480]  You can buy shares of a local farm and you'll get some food every week from them.
[47:46.480 --> 47:55.280]  Yeah, folks, the stated goal of the federal government is to transfer agriculture into
[47:55.280 --> 47:58.200]  mega agribusiness and GMO.
[47:58.200 --> 48:00.800]  And they've done it.
[48:00.800 --> 48:03.400]  There is hardly any family farm still operating.
[48:03.400 --> 48:09.720]  Everybody I know that owns a farm or a ranch, unless there's some oil company owner or computer
[48:09.720 --> 48:10.720]  company owner.
[48:10.720 --> 48:14.440]  I know people like that in Texas who then have land, but then to get the agriculture
[48:14.440 --> 48:16.640]  exemption, they have cows on it.
[48:16.640 --> 48:23.840]  The only profitable ranches and farms that are still privately held, you will see the
[48:23.840 --> 48:29.240]  family who say, oh, 100 acres, 500 acres, a thousand acres, whatever the case may be.
[48:29.240 --> 48:31.040]  And they've all got jobs at the local prison.
[48:31.040 --> 48:35.960]  They got local jobs, local power plant or they drive 18 wheelers or they own a gas station
[48:35.960 --> 48:42.280]  in town and they bust their butts from 530 in the morning till seven or eight at night.
[48:42.280 --> 48:46.120]  Now that's the still hard working people who all look down on the rest of the country people
[48:46.120 --> 48:50.200]  because all the brains has moved out of the country except for a small remnant.
[48:50.200 --> 48:54.040]  And then you got the rest of the people all basically on welfare or working at subsistence
[48:54.040 --> 48:58.460]  level jobs at the local grocery stores or whatever or at the local schools.
[48:58.460 --> 49:02.920]  And then they all just watch satellite TV all day and drink whiskey and smoke cigarettes.
[49:02.920 --> 49:07.840]  And let me tell you, it's just a, our country is, countryside is blighted.
[49:07.840 --> 49:15.040]  God, a lot of people have run from the cities into the country that has re-energized some
[49:15.040 --> 49:21.960]  of the rural areas, that new blood, we've gone from what 91% at its peak 15 years ago
[49:21.960 --> 49:29.000]  and pull the numbers up on this to about 85% city now because about 5, 6% of the city has
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.080]  moved into the country and people have started their own little farms and little many, many
[49:33.080 --> 49:36.000]  dairies and things and folks, you better buy from them.
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.520]  You better get up off your butts and support them because you know, when I'm driving along
[49:41.520 --> 49:46.360]  in Austin and I see, I know a guy who's a waiter at a local Kirby Lane restaurant.
[49:46.360 --> 49:51.040]  His grandmother died and he got like 20 acres in the middle of the city.
[49:51.040 --> 49:52.720]  He's not selling it.
[49:52.720 --> 49:57.960]  He's got a tomato and onion and some other stuff farmed and he's fighting to try to
[49:57.960 --> 49:58.960]  grow it.
[49:58.960 --> 50:02.320]  He's got a well out there in the middle of town and you see the guy out there selling
[50:02.320 --> 50:07.000]  his stuff and I try to pull over and support him, I try to go to the farmer's market
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.840]  but you know, I can't even follow my own advice because I'm usually working Saturday morning
[50:11.840 --> 50:16.440]  when they've got the farmer's market and you know, we're doing everything and they've
[50:16.440 --> 50:21.840]  got a secretly sell milk out of the back of the truck out there, raw milk, I shouldn't
[50:21.840 --> 50:26.520]  even talk about that but the point is, you know, there's all sorts of stuff going on
[50:26.520 --> 50:29.520]  and I just really appreciate your call.
[50:29.520 --> 50:30.520]  Anything else?
[50:30.520 --> 50:34.760]  I also wanted to say I don't know if you're aware of this but in Target stores now, they
[50:34.760 --> 50:40.920]  will scan your driver's license if you buy a cigarette lighter, cold medicine or alcohol.
[50:40.920 --> 50:47.160]  Well Target is really an NSA front and for folks that don't know, Target is the worst.
[50:47.160 --> 50:50.840]  Target is actually a behavioral psychology experiment.
[50:50.840 --> 50:51.840]  You can Google that.
[50:51.840 --> 50:52.840]  It's mainstream news.
[50:52.840 --> 50:56.600]  Do you ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[50:56.600 --> 50:59.360]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[50:59.360 --> 51:05.080]  I have a date with a very lovely Rachel and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney,
[51:05.080 --> 51:10.080]  finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston, online from my
[51:10.080 --> 51:11.800]  desk with Webex.
[51:11.800 --> 51:14.960]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[51:14.960 --> 51:18.880]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from
[51:18.880 --> 51:24.000]  their desktop so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.400]  Travel less, meet online.

[51:53.480 --> 51:59.080]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grounds Hero
[51:59.080 --> 52:02.640]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[52:02.640 --> 52:07.920]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[52:07.920 --> 52:09.480]  to tell their story.
[52:09.480 --> 52:18.480]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[52:18.480 --> 52:23.280]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[52:23.280 --> 52:25.560]  take action against their global masters.
[52:25.560 --> 52:28.720]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[52:28.720 --> 52:34.520]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom.
[52:34.520 --> 52:38.040]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[52:38.040 --> 52:43.880]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[52:43.880 --> 52:46.520]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[52:46.520 --> 52:50.200]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[52:50.200 --> 52:57.880]  and bring in martial law.
[52:57.880 --> 53:09.800]  Question, are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[53:09.800 --> 53:17.400]  Question, do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[53:45.680 --> 53:47.880]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[53:47.880 --> 54:12.360]  Do it now or become property of the New World Order.
[54:12.360 --> 54:39.520]  We have to shock the population out of their malaise, out of their mesmerized, hypnotized
[54:39.520 --> 54:42.880]  state.
[54:42.880 --> 54:46.640]  I had read this in different government documents for years, but then about a year ago it started
[54:46.640 --> 54:51.480]  coming out in mainstream news that target a large part of its business is security,
[54:51.480 --> 54:53.040]  data mining, tracking.
[54:53.040 --> 54:56.240]  They do studies in their stores.
[54:56.240 --> 55:00.400]  Most of your really big corporations allied decades ago with the federal government or
[55:00.400 --> 55:06.440]  were founded with funding by the federal government, by DARPA, by research because more than 90%
[55:06.440 --> 55:14.760]  of all university and private research is funded by government, by our tax dollars.
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.560]  Everything is to train you to give your driver's license, first it's cold medicine, then it's
[55:19.560 --> 55:22.360]  beer, then it's cigars, cigarettes.
[55:22.360 --> 55:26.600]  Now they announced two weeks ago, major gas chains all over the country make you come
[55:26.600 --> 55:31.200]  in with your driver's license, which is your World ID card, according to treaty 2000.
[55:31.200 --> 55:33.280]  They just not told you it's a national ID card last year.
[55:33.280 --> 55:39.160]  Of course, that was done in 1993, standardized.
[55:39.160 --> 55:43.440]  So they always tell you something's coming out, it's already in place, that you have
[55:43.440 --> 55:49.460]  to scan everything and that you have to, but now you have to go into these gas stations
[55:49.460 --> 55:55.360]  and register your license to pay with credit card, quote, to stop theft, that's their excuse.
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.440]  But in these big meetings and consortium security meetings, they admit it's about control.
[55:59.440 --> 56:05.480]  Once at target, they have the machines that take your card, your card goes into the machine
[56:05.480 --> 56:09.480]  and then comes back out to you, training you that they take it.
[56:09.480 --> 56:13.360]  You see, and once they have the cashless society in place, which they're very close to doing,
[56:13.360 --> 56:17.200]  where they'll just ID you, as I told you a decade ago from federal documents, they will
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.360]  ID you to even use cash.
[56:21.360 --> 56:25.600]  And then a record of that will be on the trash cans, the cash transaction, they will scan
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.000]  in databases, how much you're paid, how much you withdrew from the bank, from ATMs to know
[56:30.000 --> 56:35.880]  if you're getting cash from a black market program like mowing lawns or painting houses
[56:35.880 --> 56:37.920]  or garage sales.
[56:37.920 --> 56:43.600]  It's in the house bill on the verge of passing.
[56:43.600 --> 56:50.760]  The Senate would have passed the house to make everybody thumbprint and face scan for
[56:50.760 --> 56:54.960]  jobs, a lot of different sectors of the economy, but not just that.
[56:54.960 --> 56:58.880]  Every transaction you make, instantly being uploaded to the federal government, not just
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.080]  them dialing in through the Know Your Customer legislation and Patriot Act when they want
[57:03.080 --> 57:07.040]  into your account, which they already do, then of course, government people are stealing
[57:07.040 --> 57:13.680]  files and identity theft, which they're encouraged to do because then people say, oh, my identity
[57:13.680 --> 57:17.400]  has been stolen, it's all in the black market, we need more control, then they tie biometrics
[57:17.400 --> 57:19.440]  to the card.
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.280]  This is all behavioral psychology, it's all knowing what you're going to do.
[57:23.280 --> 57:30.080]  They do A, you do B, then they implement C, then you do D, then they bring in the next
[57:30.080 --> 57:31.080]  letter.
[57:31.080 --> 57:35.280]  All right, look, look, I've taken five, six calls this hour, that is not good, but each
[57:35.280 --> 57:38.240]  point people bring up, I want to document back up.
[57:38.240 --> 57:42.440]  That's what's so great about the calls, the directions they take a sin.
[57:42.440 --> 57:47.120]  Matt, Chris, Bill, Seth, Don, we're going to go to all of you.
[57:47.120 --> 57:49.920]  In fact, Matt, right now you've got a minute and a half from Georgia.
[57:49.920 --> 57:57.160]  Yeah, Alex is a big fan of yours, I hear you talk about vaccines in Florida a lot, and
[57:57.160 --> 58:02.600]  every three talks too much about chemtrails, and I was seeing them more and more.
[58:02.600 --> 58:09.720]  Because vaccine, vaccines, and I'll hold you over, vaccines and the tainted water are things
[58:09.720 --> 58:12.960]  we can stop, things we can take control of.
[58:12.960 --> 58:17.280]  We are being sprayed, it's come out, in fact, I forgot last week to play that newscast, let's
[58:17.280 --> 58:20.600]  finally play that newscast about the chemtrailing, how they're just throwing it in our face, how
[58:20.600 --> 58:29.680]  it's good for us, yes, we're all being targeted with barium salts, aluminum oxide, and other
[58:29.680 --> 58:30.680]  deadly poisons.
[58:30.680 --> 58:31.680]  Stay with us.
[58:31.680 --> 58:43.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN, be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:43.800 --> 58:48.040]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[58:48.040 --> 58:52.600]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:52.600 --> 58:58.600]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[58:58.600 --> 59:01.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:01.760 --> 59:07.680]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[59:07.680 --> 59:12.080]  of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.080 --> 59:17.560]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:17.560 --> 59:21.480]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:21.480 --> 59:24.120]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:24.120 --> 59:27.280]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[59:27.280 --> 59:29.280]  they're after power, that's their appellation.

[59:36.880 --> 59:41.880]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[59:41.880 --> 59:57.880]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:57.880 --> 59:58.880]  Matt Kovarovs.
[59:58.880 --> 59:59.880]  You want answers?
[59:59.880 --> 1:00:01.880]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:11.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:15.760]  Wide open phones today with a full four hours, three hours stretch out ahead of us.
[1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:17.760]  Matt and Georgia was bringing up Chemtrails.
[1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:18.760]  Finish your point, sir.
[1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:27.760]  Well, just talking about how vaccines, you know, my family, we don't get vaccines, and
[1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:31.000]  fluoride, we use the reverse osmosis water system.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:36.480]  But Chemtrails, it seems, I wrote my congressman about it, and he said there's nothing to worry
[1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:37.480]  about.
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:44.760]  You know, vitamin trails, love trails, they're harmless, EPA, ask all the troops dropping
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:51.560]  dead from shots, exactly, or when they tried to inject the first responders, police and
[1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:55.880]  firemen and others five years ago with the smallpox shot, a bunch of them died.
[1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:59.320]  Hey, you know, that'll wake them up real quick when they watch their buddies dropping dead
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:00.320]  in front of them.
[1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:06.480]  The shots are good, the trails are good, the government's good, GMO food's good, buddy.
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:09.200]  Okay, we'll kind of see one more thing.
[1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:10.200]  Yeah.
[1:01:10.200 --> 1:01:14.280]  You talked about in the Bilderberg group the last meeting that the families were against
[1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:15.280]  each other.
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:19.120]  Is there any possibility that there is, you know, some good people amongst these evil
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:20.120]  people?
[1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:21.440]  No, not at that higher level.
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:22.720]  They've already sold their soul repeatedly.
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:29.160]  I mean, could one of them turn around like Paul, who was Saul of Tarsus, maybe, but...
[1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:30.160]  Like Darth Vader, maybe.
[1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:31.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:35.760]  They're only fighting with each other over how to kill us and slave us, control us better.
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:39.880]  They only fight over disagreements like the mafia, you know, in the classic La Cosa Nostra
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:45.280]  have occasional wars, but they never stop selling drugs and running whores and gambling.
[1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:46.280]  And it's the same thing.
[1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:47.280]  So, no.
[1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:48.280]  They're the...
[1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:49.280]  No.
[1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:52.840]  They only argue about how to better dumb us down and haunt us down and destroy our families.
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:58.040]  And then you talk about a wolf in sheep's clothing, is there any way we can get a sheep
[1:01:58.040 --> 1:01:59.040]  in wolf's clothing?
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:02.160]  I mean, is there a possibility, you know, to infiltrate the system?
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:04.000]  Well, only to a certain level.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.760]  That's why they compartmentalize, but yes, that's the reason so much is leaked, so much
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:12.480]  comes out, so much of their plans get foiled, and that's why exposure brings them down.
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:14.680]  A lot of day they can't handle.
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:19.240]  It's like fog in the morning, the sun comes out and burns it out in a matter of minutes.
[1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:20.440]  People keep saying, what's the solution?
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:23.600]  It's expose them, discredit them, show people the full horror.
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:25.520]  How do you stop John Wayne Gacy?
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:34.880]  You pull up the floorboards in the floor of his basement and you look at the bodies.
[1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:37.040]  You show everybody and go, look, he is a killer.
[1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:38.040]  Same thing with the New World Order.
[1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:41.440]  You show them how they stage terror, how they're poisoning us, how they said they do it.
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:44.720]  All the horrible things they're doing, you expose the murderers, and when they laugh
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:48.640]  at you and say, that doesn't exist and treats you like a child and, shut up, everything's
[1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:51.440]  fine, the government's good, you just keep exposing them.
[1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:53.280]  They're discredited already.
[1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:54.280]  We've got them.
[1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:56.280]  They've blown open their gates in the Info War.
[1:02:56.280 --> 1:02:57.720]  It's now time to take them down.
[1:02:57.720 --> 1:02:58.720]  Excellent.
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:02:59.720]  Well, I'm a big fan.
[1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:00.720]  Doing a great job.
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:01.720]  Thanks a lot.
[1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:03.120]  Thank you, my friend.
[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:05.480]  Let's talk to Chris in PA.
[1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:06.480]  You're on the air, Chris.
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:07.480]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:08.480]  Hello.
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:12.480]  I'm not going to take up too much of your time.
[1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:15.040]  I wanted to hit on two topics real quick.
[1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:22.680]  First was a theory I had for a piece of their end game puzzle and I took information from
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:28.600]  some of the things I heard on your show and from the movies I was able to see of yours.
[1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:34.840]  One being the homosexual tendencies as evidenced by the Bohemian Grove and possibly other things
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:36.640]  that are unknown to me at this point.
[1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:38.320]  Well, it's not even that.
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:45.360]  That is a tendency, but it's just wild sexual activities, sadomasochism, heterosexual prostitution,
[1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:48.920]  homosexual prostitution, extreme behavior.
[1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:49.920]  Okay.
[1:03:49.920 --> 1:03:56.840]  That is a tendency of the elite, just like it was in Rome or any other imperial system.
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:00.520]  They get very decadent.
[1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:06.640]  Other information being, I believe I've heard that China is kind of like a test model for
[1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:16.120]  their globalization plans and I also heard like 40 million more men than there are women
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:22.960]  in China right now and last piece of information would be like they seem to have an affinity
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:29.480]  for like sci-fi type technology and- Well, the elite always wants to dominate the newest
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:33.320]  technologies so they have dominance, but is that your question?
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:39.080]  Well, that's what my theory was that the 80 to 90% of the population that they want to
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:47.720]  eliminate, I was thinking that it's possible that 100% of that 80 to 90 would be women
[1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:50.360]  and that they might rely on- Let me talk about that when we get back.
[1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:55.560]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.

[1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:54.040]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:56.040]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:58.040]  Do you like being a puppet sir?
[1:05:58.040 --> 1:06:00.040]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:04.520]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a state, it was engineered by you, David
[1:06:04.520 --> 1:06:07.520]  Rockefeller that's for a lateral commission to see it for.
[1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:14.520]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:06:14.520 --> 1:06:16.520]  to grow at our own door.
[1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:22.520]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:24.520]  An inside job?
[1:06:24.520 --> 1:06:28.520]  How dare you?
[1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:32.520]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:34.520]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:39.520]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years we will be here on the 10th
[1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:40.520]  anniversary of life.

[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:58.520]  Hello, Alex.
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:18.520]  I just wanted to speak briefly about contingency plans relating to Iran.
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:38.520]  I do think it's important to have an open discussion, constantly put this in people's consciousness again, people in the movement, new listeners, whatever it might be.
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:56.520]  Wake up one morning, one afternoon, one evening, and the announcement is made that we've either been attacked, provoked whether it be a false flag event or a legitimate attack, and we're all of a sudden thrust into this new conflict elevating the conflict in the Middle East.
[1:26:56.520 --> 1:27:12.520]  I'm just curious, what do we do? And I'm not asking for you to give me an exact answer. There's many things we can do, but just to kind of put that in people's minds.
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:28.520]  If Iran's attacked and Iran does something back, that could be Iran. But if it's just out of the blue, key bono, who benefits, it'll be the shadow government, which stands to gain, getting power from staging the event that gives them more power.
[1:27:28.520 --> 1:27:38.520]  And we need to hit the streets everywhere and say it's an inside job with one unified voice and bring up all the examples of past inside jobs.
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:54.520]  I agree, absolutely. I remember being at the 9-11 Neocon and the Neocon agenda 2006 LA conference, and I forget if it was Barry's wicker or Webster Tarpley, who in essence brought up, you know, shouldn't attack Iran, go forward, speaking about a general strike.
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:28:10.520]  I would never advocate open violence, because as you said many times, I agree that it's exactly what the New World Order wants.
[1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:26.520]  It's a hatred movement that really knows what's going on, or the truth movement, or the liberty movement, people that just want to be free. And that's what we are. We're just free humanity movement. But, you know, we really don't have the power, unless I guess you, the listeners, went completely crazy to really get a big strike going.
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:40.520]  People tried that. When people are so, you know, poor and so in debt, I mean, how do they not work? But passively, not going along with the government, demonizing the government, exposing them for their crimes, discrediting them.
[1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:46.520]  I mean, if they stage attacks now, it's not going to go over as well, because people know about it now.
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:56.520]  It's jamming another call here. Bill and Glenn and Pia, you're on the air. Come ahead, Glenn.
[1:28:56.520 --> 1:29:10.520]  How you doing today, Alex? Drive on, drive on. Hey, I was, I got out of the military in 1987, and I was pretty interested when you were talking yesterday, I guess it was, about the time delay soft kill weapons that they were using on us.
[1:29:10.520 --> 1:29:26.520]  I was wondering if maybe you could go into a little more details on that sometime in the not too distant future. And I also wanted to point out that just us being aware that we're being lied to is a pretty good antidote towards the constant barrage of propaganda and mind control.
[1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:36.520]  Stay there. I don't want to short change you, Glenn. We'll come back to you and many others on the other side of this quick break. We're covering the news right now because callers bring up so many facets. Stay with us.
[1:29:36.520 --> 1:29:50.520]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:50.520 --> 1:30:04.520]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:21.520]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:35.520]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[1:30:49.520 --> 1:31:01.520]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right? First, I get the best parking space at work. Tonight I have a date with a very lovely Rachel and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:11.520]  Finalize the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston, online from my desk with WebEx. WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[1:31:11.520 --> 1:31:20.520]  I just talked to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:58.520]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do. At least we thought we did.
[1:31:58.520 --> 1:32:05.520]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:14.520]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:32:14.520 --> 1:32:21.520]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:30.520]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear it 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:32:30.520 --> 1:32:42.520]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:32:42.520 --> 1:32:49.520]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:32:49.520 --> 1:33:00.520]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:33:00.520 --> 1:33:26.520]  Multiple mainstream newspapers are reporting that the FBI offered 2.4 million sports cars you name it to the sun of the latest Patsy that they have framed, the conveniently dead Patsy.
[1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:43.520]  I mean, this is getting really dirty. They were really desperate as it came out that, uh, and supposedly they thought this guy did the anthrax attacks for four years while blaming Stephen Hadfield.
[1:33:43.520 --> 1:33:50.520]  I mean, the FBI's still lying and saying it wasn't weaponized anthrax when the other branch of the federal government says, oh yeah, it was weaponized.
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:57.520]  U.S. So criminal, such liars.
[1:33:57.520 --> 1:34:06.520]  But you have a distracted public, even though the economy's falling apart and the nation's falling apart, the world's falling apart. They're still obsessed with Brett Favre.
[1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:11.520]  Let go from the Green Bay Packers. That's what's important.
[1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:21.520]  Male soap operas is all that is. You know, men don't make fun of women watching soap operas, folks. That's what your sports is.
[1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:32.520]  And I'm not saying that last night when I pulled into a restaurant to eat something and they didn't have ESPN on and I saw them that having a Brett Favre that my old instincts as a sports fan didn't have me watching and I was ashamed of myself.
[1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:36.520]  I mean, here is the country going to hell in a handbasket. This doesn't matter.
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:46.520]  You know, him driving out of the parking lot in his red expedition.
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:51.520]  It's shameful what's going on and how distracted from reality we've gotten.
[1:34:51.520 --> 1:35:01.520]  Men, you have the instincts for war and the instincts for tribalism and the instincts for wanting to know who different captains are and who different leaders are for defending your tribe and your people.
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:09.520]  But they take that and incorporate it into sports where you know all the teams, the tribes, the leaders, the captains, the chiefs.
[1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:14.520]  You know, it's all tribal. It's why you like it because it fills a gap in your psyche.
[1:35:14.520 --> 1:35:17.520]  You're supposed to know who the evil captains of the federal government are.
[1:35:17.520 --> 1:35:20.520]  You're supposed to know about espionage. You're supposed to be involved.
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:27.520]  You're supposed to be on the field at your city council and at your state legislature and on the field waking up your neighbors and organizing.
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:31.520]  But instead you have a facsimile.
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:39.520]  I've used the horrible analogy of it's like a man not going out and finding a girlfriend and courting her and marrying her and having children.
[1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:45.520]  It's like sports fans aren't real men who spend their lives thinking it's manly to be into sports and sports only.
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:56.520]  It's like never marrying. It's like you have a blow up doll in the closet and you set her up at the dinner table at night and feed her dinner and you talk to her and you buy her diamond rings every anniversary.
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:36:03.520]  But it's a plastic doll. It's not real.
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:10.520]  You know, the fretting and the worrying and knowing all the minutiae about the teams and all my heart's beating fast.
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:14.520]  Oh, what's going to happen with my favorite pitcher?
[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:17.520]  Oh, that's all behavioral psychology.
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:20.520]  The Romans wrote books about how it was to control you.
[1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:23.520]  2000 years ago.
[1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:31.520]  All right, I'm going to shut up and go back to your calls. Glenn and PA, then Rob, Steve, Elliott, Ron and others. Glenn, go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:42.520]  Well, I was saying, I was pretty interested in what you were saying the other day about the soft kill weapons in the vaccines being used on the military personnel because I got out of the military about 21 years ago.
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:45.520]  And this is starting to concern me a little bit.
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:54.520]  Also, I wanted to make you aware of my local newspaper. There's a 12 column inch article on the latest patsy. Dr. Ivins, I think his name is.
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:55.520]  Yes.
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:37:02.520]  There's 12 column inches about how he was stalking and obsessed with some sorority. So the smear continues on this poor guy.
[1:37:02.520 --> 1:37:08.520]  And then meanwhile, it comes out the FBI is running around trying to throw millions around for people to lie about it.
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:10.520]  Exactly, exactly.
[1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:18.520]  It was a pretty good show yesterday with Dr. or Mr. Alan Waddon. You guys were talking about what makes us, what wakes us up.
[1:37:18.520 --> 1:37:26.520]  And I think that to some degree, just being aware that something isn't right helps to wake you up because that's what happened to me when I got out of the military.
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:34.520]  Yeah, it's like knowing there are cattle wrestlers in town. You start watching your cows and start trying to bring them into the barn at night.
[1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:42.520]  Just knowing that someone's escaped from the insane asylum who likes to kidnap kids.
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:49.520]  You know, my mother grew up in North Austin. What was North Austin then? A few miles from the state hospital in the Hyde Park area.
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:55.520]  And she remembers the alarms would go off a few times a year when one of the nuts would get out. You know, the point is, it's the same thing.
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:38:02.520]  So yes, knowing is half the battle. And knowing you're being lied to, knowing that there's another agenda going on.
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:06.520]  And they know that most people are aware of that. So they give you, oh, we have the alternative to the liberal media.
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:11.520]  We have Fox News and you find out it's controlled. Well, yeah, we have the alternative to that.
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:20.520]  So really don't trust anything. You know, trust what you can verify for yourself. Trust original core government documents, programs that have come out, things they've been caught doing.
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:23.520]  And I appreciate your call.
[1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:28.520]  Let me try to just briefly, and I'm going to try to do a whole show on this.
[1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:32.520]  And I'm going to get Dr. Stan Montief on. I think I'm going to get Alan Waddon.
[1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:39.520]  In fact, let's try to set that up next week. Let's have Alan Waddon for an hour specifically with all his research and documents. He's really good.
[1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:47.520]  And when I heard him mentioning things on air, those are things I've read, checked, found, seen myself, and then he'll bring up other stuff I didn't know. I will check it out. It's accurate.
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:55.520]  The probably the foremost expert on this is a medical doctor, Dr. Stan Montief, who is neurotic about documenting everything.
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:59.520]  And in the 20s, they found out that cancer was communicable.
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:02.520]  Most cancer can go read the studies on it.
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:17.520]  Depending on the study, 85, 95, or sometimes higher percent, they knew in the 20s, the Rockefellers were masters because they took their money from oil and rubber and railroads and their monopolies.
[1:39:17.520 --> 1:39:26.520]  And they put it into research on electricity and research on new shipping and research on new engines and research on eugenics and research on new drugs.
[1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:32.520]  And they financed the big boom in pharmacological developments in Germany and England.
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:38.520]  I mean, they didn't buy big mansions till later. They spent all their money.
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:49.520]  I mean, the old man Rockefeller would work 18, 20 hours a day up until his late 80s, and then his son took over, John D.
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:55.520]  He got John D. Jr. today running around the Senate, but again, I said, I'm going to go to your calls.
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:57.520]  I start regressing into all the evidence.
[1:39:57.520 --> 1:40:08.520]  There are not hundreds, but thousands of government documents about how they all Rockefeller funded and some of it's in the U.S. funded by a few others.
[1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:11.520]  But mainly, that's a turn of the phrase, you know, all of it.
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:13.520]  Most of it being funded by the Rockefellers.
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:16.520]  Carnegie Endowment, you got the British Royal Family, the Gothas.
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:21.520]  That's their family name, funding a lot of it.
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:24.520]  And you see them learning that cancers are communicable.
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:28.520]  Then you see them moving into vaccine production. Then you see cancer suddenly exploding.
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:36.520]  You see them monopolizing and owning most of the major cancer research hospitals and institutes and treatment centers in the U.S.
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:40.520]  And making money out of it, how to get all your money that you've saved up at the end of your life.
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:44.520]  How to carry out eugenics that after workers have been useful, getting rid of them.
[1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:52.520]  Studies on that, studies on how to sterilize women, studies on how to carry it out, studies on how to compartmentalize it.
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:59.520]  And then you find out about how they tested chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals on troops.
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:08.520]  They injected nerve gas, nerve agents, biological agents, radioactive agents in the thousands of troops in the U.S., England, Australia, you name it.
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:10.520]  It's always coming out in the news.
[1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:12.520]  Testing it. And now they've radically expanded it.
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:14.520]  You see the numbers of dead and dying troops.
[1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:19.520]  The massive increases in their cancers and the statistics.
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:28.520]  When you find original source documents from the different major medical facilities about how they wanted to do this and you see it, what they called for being carried out.
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:38.520]  Then you isolate the vaccines. You find sterilization compounds, cancer viruses and hundreds of different vaccines that have been put out that have massively, massively increased in the studies.
[1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:41.520]  Cancers. And they say, oh, it was an accident. We put it in there.
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:46.520]  Then you go back with medical doctors and scientists, epidemiologists, pharaologists on the show and in their own research.
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:50.520]  Even the Indian government exposed this in the mid 90s.
[1:41:50.520 --> 1:42:02.520]  They find out that, wait, that virus isn't associated with the production of the vaccine. It was added or that hormone to sterilize added to a pathogen because an autoimmune response wasn't involved in the chain of production of that.
[1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:12.520]  And wait, over 100 different vaccine makers, quote, accidentally added the virus separately that isn't involved and wouldn't be involved in the regular chain of the development of that virus.
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:17.520]  So it's just absolute.
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:24.520]  I mean, we've caught them testing and killing and doing all this thousands of times.
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:33.520]  But then with the current massive increase in cancer and the troops dying and the newscast we air and they get the shot and they die a week later or they are paralyzed a week later.
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:41.520]  Or, you know, all of that. It's basically like, we know this guy has killed people before let's you hypothetically the new orders of serial killer.
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:49.520]  The MO is they like to pull up to hijackers and shoot them three times in the head.
[1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:57.520]  And then time and time again, we see the same MO and we see them pulling up and then you know, oh, it's this killer or it's a copycat.
[1:42:57.520 --> 1:43:03.520]  You know, it's not even a two plus two equals four. It's a one plus one equals two.
[1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:09.520]  It is, they're doing it. It's happening. It's going on.
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:15.520]  And they'll just ride out in the open and bring out all these new vaccines, these live cancer virus vaccines that are killing people.
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:18.520]  They'll just bring out on the market.
[1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:32.520]  Here's an example. They've always been obsessed for some reason because of the earliest research 150 years ago with killing hemophiliacs because for some reason in breeding creates hemophilia.
[1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:41.520]  We see this with the Egyptians, some of the earliest embraders, you know, brothers marrying sisters over and over again.
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:48.520]  And it's and with these people, sometimes it does create idiot savants and incredible intelligence in the elite, but more than not, it creates.
[1:43:48.520 --> 1:43:54.520]  I mean, they had cases where eight out of 10 and cover this in end game of these elite British families that are married for four generations.
[1:43:54.520 --> 1:44:01.520]  80 plus percent of their kids would die at birth or be totally retarded.
[1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:03.520]  So they're obsessed with hemophiliacs.
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:10.520]  And so they claim that they want to kill all the hemophiliacs in early stuff 150 years ago, 100 years ago.
[1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:15.520]  And it's stated in all these Galton documents and the rest of them.
[1:44:15.520 --> 1:44:20.520]  And so time and time again, we see vaccine makers.
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:26.520]  We see blood companies, blood product companies, Bayer and others.
[1:44:26.520 --> 1:44:39.520]  I mean, Bayer for more than a decade knew that every dosage of factor eight, which is a blood clotting agent made out of.
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:44.520]  Well, basically, they just take thousands of pints, put them into huge vats of blood.
[1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:45.520]  They don't screen it.
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:50.520]  They know AIDS and hepatitis is in there every time, every, every injection had it.
[1:44:50.520 --> 1:45:00.520]  And it's a live blood product and they knew that it was going to kill or second everyone that took it.
[1:45:00.520 --> 1:45:05.520]  And then in lawsuits three years ago when they lost, there were criminal charges in France, but nowhere else.
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:07.520]  It was even on mainstream news.
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:10.520]  It came out that they knew it wasn't just a business thing.
[1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:11.520]  They knew from the start.
[1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:12.520]  That was the whole point.
[1:45:12.520 --> 1:45:15.520]  And I can just, there's hundreds of other examples.
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:20.520]  The point is, how would you trust people that keep doing this over and over again?
[1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:26.520]  And then the media and the government from Australia to New Zealand, to Canada, to England, to the U.S.
[1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:32.520]  Lie every year in August when children go back to school and say, it's going on the news right now, everywhere.
[1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:33.520]  It's the law.
[1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:34.520]  Got to take vaccines.
[1:45:34.520 --> 1:45:35.520]  You'll be arrested.
[1:45:35.520 --> 1:45:36.520]  There is no law.
[1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:37.520]  It's a total lie.
[1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:39.520]  See, how would you trust someone who lies?
[1:45:39.520 --> 1:45:44.520]  Not just that the vaccines keep killing and maiming people and brain damaging them, but that they lie and say,
[1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:46.520]  you've got to take it.
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:50.520]  I mean, that was a major martial law example.
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:59.520]  Last August, and we even had the state's attorney from Maryland on.
[1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:02.520]  And he said on there, I don't vaccinate my children and laughed.
[1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:05.520]  And he said, yeah, people don't have to take it.
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:08.520]  But then we had him on the news saying, you've got to take it.
[1:46:08.520 --> 1:46:09.520]  Remember that article?
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:10.520]  We wrote an article posted the audio of it.
[1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:12.520]  You can go pull it up.
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:19.520]  And there was the image on the news of 1500 students, a thousand or more parents being
[1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:25.520]  herded into a giant auditorium next door to the courthouse with a judge up there saying,
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:26.520]  it's the law.
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:31.520]  You got to take it with police dogs barking and in riot gear, injecting people who believe
[1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:32.520]  it was the law.
[1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:40.520]  That's total fraud, total tyranny, absolutely criminal and a mass example of just ignorance
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:49.520]  and the cops thinking it's the law, the judge being a liar, the state attorney lying.
[1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:51.520]  That's the evil.
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:53.520]  There was no law.
[1:46:53.520 --> 1:46:55.520]  Now they play a trick.
[1:46:55.520 --> 1:46:59.520]  They suspend you illegally because under law, they have to give you a waiver.
[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:00.520]  But that law is a fraud.
[1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:02.520]  If you read carefully, they have it in every state.
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:05.520]  It says it's policy of the school that you take inoculation.
[1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:15.520]  So it's policy, just like there's policy that you don't wear a t-shirt that says FU bleep
[1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:16.520]  K on it.
[1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:21.520]  Well, it's policy that you don't have your pants hanging down around your ankles.
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:23.520]  It's no law.
[1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:28.520]  It's policy you take the shot, but because they have to give you a waiver, which you
[1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:31.520]  don't even need that, but they won't tell you there's a waiver.
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:36.520]  But see, then they implement truancy charges because they kick you out illegally.
[1:47:36.520 --> 1:47:39.520]  Then they implement truancy charges and that's where the law kicks in.
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:42.520]  It's a very simple lawyer trick.
[1:47:42.520 --> 1:47:47.520]  You have a government systematically engaging in fraud, systematically engaging in mass
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:53.520]  hoaxes and lies with police dogs and police barking as people are lined up being given
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:48:00.520]  shots by every major vaccine company who are all founded for eugenics to carry out eugenics
[1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:05.520]  and who have been involved putting cancer viruses, poisons, hormones, sterilization
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:15.520]  compounds, HIV, on and on and on.
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:18.520]  And then you have the military saying, we're going to line you up and give you this shot
[1:48:18.520 --> 1:48:20.520]  over and over again and not tell you what it is.
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:22.520]  And then if you ask, we're not going to tell you.
[1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:25.520]  And if you're dying in the hospital, we won't tell you it's secret.
[1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:28.520]  We put something secret in you.
[1:48:28.520 --> 1:48:30.520]  You know why they say that now?
[1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:40.520]  Because Congress had to pass a law saying no experimental vaccines pointing out the previous law.
[1:48:40.520 --> 1:48:47.520]  Pointing out the previous law that stated you had to have informed consent even in the military.
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:48.520]  They don't care.
[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:52.520]  They line those men up, those women up who don't know they're righteous like U.S. citizens.
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:53.520]  And they say, you're in the military.
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:54.520]  You said papers.
[1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:56.520]  You're not going to be told what this is.
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:48:58.520]  You'll be court-martialed if you don't take it.
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:03.520]  Now, you notice the majors and the captains and the colonels and the generals.
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:04.520]  It's in the press all the time.
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:06.520]  They will refuse and that's okay.
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:11.520]  But they line those people right up to Master Sergeant right up and they say, you will take this.
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:15.520]  I will not tell you, you piece of filth, what it is.
[1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:18.520]  It's just like you're back in boot camp again.
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:19.520]  And you talk to the troops.
[1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:23.520]  Everyone of them will start vomiting, diarrhea.
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:25.520]  Suddenly they got spots on their eyes for a week.
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:26.520]  They can't hear.
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:27.520]  They're vomiting.
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:29.520]  One of their buddies will go to the infirmary.
[1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:30.520]  He's dead a week later.
[1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:31.520]  What the hell's in this stuff?
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:34.520]  They line you up again in a month and say, you will take it.
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:37.520]  Not going to hear any of your bold conspiracy theories.
[1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:38.520]  Well, what is it?
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:39.520]  What is it, Sarge?
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:41.520]  I'm taking it, you little piece of crap.
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:43.520]  You don't ask me what it is.
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:46.520]  You're not allowed to know.
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:54.520]  That's what they do.
[1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:56.520]  And then you take it in a month later, your kidneys fail.
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:49:58.520]  You lost 45 pounds, your own dialysis.
[1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:00.520]  You got infections all over you.
[1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:06.520]  You got blood coming out your ears and nose, your mouth, your toenails.
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:07.520]  You die.
[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:08.520]  Your parents are there.
[1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:09.520]  They roll you out.
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:10.520]  They put you in a coffin.
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:11.520]  You go in the ground.
[1:50:11.520 --> 1:50:14.520]  Black ops continues.
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:18.520]  The only reason I'm still alive is because I've told it exactly how it is.
[1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:23.520]  And I've got their game playing down folks and they don't want to, they don't want to
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:26.520]  make me a cult hero, ladies and gentlemen, and thank God for it.
[1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:28.520]  Because I want to keep on living.
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:32.520]  But I have put it all on the line to tell you what's going on.
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:36.520]  I have put it all on the line to tell it like it is.
[1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:37.520]  Okay.
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:39.520]  I don't care how good your calls are.
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:40.520]  We're going to blitz through them.
[1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:41.520]  A minute of peace when we get back.
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:43.520]  Burma's coming up a little bit in the next hour.
[1:50:43.520 --> 1:50:44.520]  Tons of other news.
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:50.520]  I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com.
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:55.520]  I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com.
[1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:43.520]  We're in a no holds bar information war.
[1:51:43.520 --> 1:51:49.520]  Truth is our weapon and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to big brother.
[1:51:49.520 --> 1:51:50.520]  Why should we fire Congress?
[1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:54.520]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[1:51:54.520 --> 1:51:56.520]  They swear an oath to follow it and then they reject it.
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:59.520]  That was their employment document.
[1:51:59.520 --> 1:52:00.520]  They haven't followed it.
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:02.520]  Congressman, Senators, you're fired.
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:04.520]  Washington, you're fired.
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:06.520]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[1:52:06.520 --> 1:52:10.520]  Washington, you're fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system.
[1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:13.520]  And it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:17.520]  Washington, you're fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster.
[1:52:17.520 --> 1:52:19.520]  The president's illegal spy program.
[1:52:19.520 --> 1:52:20.520]  NSA data mining.
[1:52:20.520 --> 1:52:21.520]  FISA secret court.
[1:52:21.520 --> 1:52:23.520]  The illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans.
[1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:26.520]  And the last seven years of terror related spy bills.
[1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:28.520]  How they affect you and what you can do about it.
[1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:33.520]  Washington, you're fired captures the spirit and zest of an old fashioned Boston tea party.
[1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:37.520]  Ken Williams describes the film as a rabble rousing call to arms.
[1:52:37.520 --> 1:52:39.520]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[1:52:39.520 --> 1:52:40.520]  Help take back our government now.
[1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:45.520]  Go to takebackwashington.com and get the video tools you need for the information war.
[1:52:45.520 --> 1:52:47.520]  We have a plan to take back our government.
[1:52:47.520 --> 1:52:49.520]  Please visit takebackwashington.com.
[1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:52.520]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:56.520]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:52:57.520]  How so Clyde?
[1:52:57.520 --> 1:53:00.520]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[1:53:00.520 --> 1:53:05.520]  Just by waving it near you, I can skin your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:06.520]  Just watch.
[1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:08.520]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[1:53:08.520 --> 1:53:10.520]  You gotta be kidding me.
[1:53:10.520 --> 1:53:14.520]  Nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:17.520]  As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:19.520]  Why? What's identity stronghold?
[1:53:19.520 --> 1:53:21.520]  They make the secure sleeve.
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:24.520]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:27.520]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[1:53:27.520 --> 1:53:28.520]  No way.
[1:53:28.520 --> 1:53:32.520]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:35.520]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:36.520]  I already got some.
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:38.520]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:42.520]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:44.520]  Idstronghold.com?
[1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:45.520]  Right.
[1:53:45.520 --> 1:54:14.520]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:24.520]  Rob in California, you're on the air. Welcome.
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:26.520]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[1:54:26.520 --> 1:54:27.520]  Good.
[1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:34.520]  Yeah, I'm calling because I kind of think I made a connection between the whole carbon credit thing and something that goes back a little bit farther.
[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:39.520]  There's an organization called Technocracy Incorporated. Have you heard of them?
[1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:40.520]  No.
[1:54:40.520 --> 1:54:50.520]  Yeah, I'll look them up. They originally were the technical alliance in 1911, but the Technocracy Incorporated was incorporated in 1933.
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:55:00.520]  Basically, they say on their website, which they look like a bunch of utopian geeks that have no effect on anything,
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:08.520]  but if you read their website, they say that in a technique, human beings would be treated for the first time in social history,
[1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:13.520]  not as willful entities subject to legalistic prohibitions, restraints, and penalizations,
[1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:23.520]  but as energy-consuming devices whose capacities as producers and consumers necessitated the development of the highest state of both capacities
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:32.520]  in order that the human beings be conditioned to living in a world of plenty where man's advantage over his fellowmen will no longer be socially profitable.
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:34.520]  Which means everyone will be a slave, basically.
[1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:39.520]  Everyone will be a slave except the 1,000 or whatever super elite.
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:43.520]  Which is what they now put in the Washington Post and New York Times.
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:46.520]  That was a big deal three months ago in the Washington Post and New York Times.
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:49.520]  Both had stories with the headline super class in them.
[1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:54.520]  Then they said, we run everything, you run nothing, shut up slaves.
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:56.520]  They're setting up a world government.
[1:55:56.520 --> 1:55:58.520]  Again, just throwing the gauntlet down.
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:56:01.520]  All these years they denied it, they just let you know.
[1:56:01.520 --> 1:56:06.520]  Yeah, and I don't think they really even need 500 million because I mean...
[1:56:06.520 --> 1:56:11.520]  Yeah, listen, they tell the mid-level technocrats that they're only going to kill 80% of us.
[1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:14.520]  That's official U.N. policies to kill 80%.
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:23.520]  The majority say 90%, but a large minority and the higher up you go on the elite structure is for total human extermination.
[1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:24.520]  So they're very honest.
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:29.520]  They say it will be a great honor as the last New World Order leader.
[1:56:29.520 --> 1:56:31.520]  And folks, you can't make this stuff up.
[1:56:31.520 --> 1:56:37.520]  As we kill ourselves for Earth and then hand things over to a robotic system,
[1:56:37.520 --> 1:56:42.520]  which will then deconstruct the evidence of man and leave the Earth intact.
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:48.520]  Well, that carbon credit sounds just like the energy unit thing and they kind of recycle it.
[1:56:48.520 --> 1:56:50.520]  No, that's it. What do you think the Matrix is?
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:55.520]  The movie The Matrix is out of a 1980s, declassified in 2000.
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:57:01.520]  In July, excuse me, January 7th, 2000, Federation American scientists,
[1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:05.520]  they say we are all going to be batteries, just like they live in Tokyo,
[1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:10.520]  where you go home to a coffin basically that slides into a wall with a TV set and things inside there.
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:16.520]  It says we will be basically batteries in a hive mind who will be the military's final job,
[1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:19.520]  will be then inserting themselves into this in 2025.
[1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:22.520]  They'll be the last around making sure we were all inserted.
[1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:24.520]  Folks, I'm not the one saying it.
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:28.520]  Okay, look up Bayer knowingly giving millions of people AIDS.
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:30.520]  You can't make this stuff up.
[1:57:30.520 --> 1:57:34.520]  Okay, there's psychopathic nutcases, scientists with unlimited cash.
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:36.520]  Yeah, that's what it is.
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:37.520]  Okay, well, take it easy, Alex.
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:38.520]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:40.520]  All right, send me that website.
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:42.520]  I'm not aware of that particular one.
[1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:44.520]  What do you say, technocrat.com?
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:48.520]  But I do know that they say similar things all over globalist writings.
[1:57:48.520 --> 1:57:54.520]  I got a bunch of their writings and footnotes in in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:57:54.520 --> 1:57:57.520]  And don't forget, in-game blueprint for global enslavement,
[1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:00.520]  it has a bibliography that a great listener put together and we checked it.
[1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:01.520]  It's accurate.
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:03.520]  We appreciate that.
[1:58:03.520 --> 1:58:06.520]  Another great listener made a bibliography for martial law.
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:10.520]  I feel martial law and martial law 911.info.
[1:58:10.520 --> 1:58:13.520]  But what is the in-game.com?
[1:58:13.520 --> 1:58:16.520]  When you watch that film, you go to what is the in-game.com?
[1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:18.520]  And you can see the whole thing bibliographed.
[1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:21.520]  Every video, clip, every document, every news article.
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:22.520]  It's all there.
[1:58:22.520 --> 1:58:24.520]  You want to go read the North American Union documents?
[1:58:24.520 --> 1:58:26.520]  What is the in-game.com?
[1:58:26.520 --> 1:58:28.520]  Get the film today.
[1:58:30.520 --> 1:58:33.520]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:38.520]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:40.520 --> 1:58:42.520]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:58:42.520 --> 1:58:45.520]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:58:45.520 --> 1:58:47.520]  11 was an inside job.
[1:58:47.520 --> 1:58:48.520]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:58:48.520 --> 1:58:50.520]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:58:50.520 --> 1:58:53.520]  How do the American people know that not 11 was a stage?
[1:58:53.520 --> 1:58:55.520]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:58:55.520 --> 1:58:57.520]  the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[1:58:59.520 --> 1:59:02.520]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day
[1:59:02.520 --> 1:59:06.520]  that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:59:06.520 --> 1:59:09.520]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[1:59:09.520 --> 1:59:12.520]  a global awakening has taken place.
[1:59:12.520 --> 1:59:16.520]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:59:18.520 --> 1:59:20.520]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:59:20.520 --> 1:59:22.520]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:25.520]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:59:25.520 --> 1:59:27.520]  And if the government has not told the truth
[1:59:27.520 --> 1:59:42.520]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...
[1:59:57.520 --> 2:00:03.520]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:03.520 --> 2:00:09.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:09.520 --> 2:00:12.520]  There is ultramassive developments taking place
[2:00:12.520 --> 2:00:14.520]  in the new anthrax patsy.
[2:00:14.520 --> 2:00:16.520]  Jason Bermas said about 20 minutes is going to be in studio.
[2:00:16.520 --> 2:00:17.520]  I'll put him in there.
[2:00:17.520 --> 2:00:20.520]  I just want to get to all your calls that have been holding first.
[2:00:20.520 --> 2:00:23.520]  Steve, Elliot Braun and others were going here right now.
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:26.520]  Steve, where are you calling from today? You're on the air.
[2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:27.520]  I'm from Minnesota.
[2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:28.520]  Welcome.
[2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:31.520]  Yes, hi to you also, Alex.
[2:00:31.520 --> 2:00:35.520]  I just wanted to mention a little bit about the paper reduction act.
[2:00:35.520 --> 2:00:40.520]  And this is in the title, 44.
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:48.520]  Subchapter, chapter 35 of the coordination of federal information.
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:52.520]  And this is in the definitions, the last paragraph,
[2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:56.520]  in the 3502 definitions.
[2:00:56.520 --> 2:01:03.520]  It states that of penalty...
[2:01:03.520 --> 2:01:06.520]  Oh, I lost my paper here.
[2:01:06.520 --> 2:01:10.520]  Includes the imposition of the agency or court of fine
[2:01:10.520 --> 2:01:13.520]  or other punishment of judgment for monetary damages,
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:16.520]  equality, relief, or revocation, suspension,
[2:01:16.520 --> 2:01:19.520]  reduction, or denial of license, right, grant,
[2:01:19.520 --> 2:01:22.520]  or privilege, or benefit.
[2:01:22.520 --> 2:01:27.520]  It also says in subsection 3512,
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:32.520]  the public protection, notwithstanding of any other provision,
[2:01:32.520 --> 2:01:35.520]  a law and old person shall be subject to any penalty for failing
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:38.520]  to comply with the collection of information
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:40.520]  that is subject to this subchapter.
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:44.520]  And then it goes down that the collection information
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:47.520]  does not display a valid control number assigned to the director
[2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:49.520]  in this coordination subchapter.
[2:01:49.520 --> 2:01:53.520]  The agency, number two, fails to inform the person
[2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:56.520]  who was responding to the collection of information
[2:01:56.520 --> 2:01:59.520]  that such person is not required to respond
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:02.520]  or collection of information unless it displays
[2:02:02.520 --> 2:02:04.520]  a valid control number.
[2:02:04.520 --> 2:02:07.520]  This protection provided by...
[2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:11.520]  Sir, you're going to have to tell people what the whole point of this is.
[2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:18.520]  Is there something that I found out that makes the 1040 form fraud?
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:20.520]  Well, obviously, U.S. code is going to have to say
[2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:22.520]  you have a Fifth Amendment,
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:25.520]  but they criminally still come after you if you don't fill out the 1040.
[2:02:25.520 --> 2:02:27.520]  I mean, here's an example.
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:30.520]  Take the 1986 Privacy Act saying it's a felony
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:33.520]  if somebody makes you use a social security number.
[2:02:33.520 --> 2:02:36.520]  But you try going down to the DPS in any state
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:39.520]  and getting anything without that number.
[2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:41.520]  Okay, see, this is my whole point.
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:45.520]  It's a lawless, criminal, disgusting government.
[2:02:45.520 --> 2:02:46.520]  And don't worry.
[2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:48.520]  All of you that serve it are going to get everything you want.
[2:02:48.520 --> 2:02:51.520]  You're going to get hurt real bad by your masters.
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:52.520]  Now, I hear you.
[2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:54.520]  Actually, I'm aware of that area.
[2:02:54.520 --> 2:02:56.520]  I've seen that before, the Paper Reduction Act.
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:02:59.520]  That has been cited by a lot of the different people
[2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:02.520]  that are exposing the IRS as a fraud.
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:05.520]  But, see, they have low-grade morons with machine guns
[2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:08.520]  that will eat their own guts and ask for seconds,
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:11.520]  kill their mommy and ask for seconds.
[2:03:11.520 --> 2:03:14.520]  And so, really, you know, that's why it's a lawless,
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:18.520]  criminal group working for even bigger criminals.
[2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:20.520]  I haven't even filed myself since 95,
[2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:23.520]  so they're always on my back about something or what.
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:25.520]  And that's why they want the casualist society
[2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:27.520]  so you can't buy or sell,
[2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:29.520]  and then they're going to make being homeless illegal
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:31.520]  and they're going to pick you up and take you to a work camp.
[2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:33.520]  Then they're going to give you an inoculation
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:35.520]  that's going to soft kill you,
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:37.520]  but they're going to move people as they kill them
[2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:39.520]  so it isn't as obvious.
[2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:41.520]  It's all part of the loving plan, murdering and slaughtering
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:43.520]  and killing.
[2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:46.520]  But it won't matter, just like they gave mainstream news
[2:03:46.520 --> 2:03:49.520]  in Huntsville, Texas, all sorts of biological weapons
[2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:51.520]  to the prisoners.
[2:03:51.520 --> 2:03:53.520]  Then it killed a bunch of the jailguards and their families.
[2:03:53.520 --> 2:03:56.520]  You all get to drink from the black cup of lucifer.
[2:03:56.520 --> 2:03:59.520]  Well, I sent them that information
[2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:01.520]  with my name signed on it,
[2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:04.520]  and they sent me that,
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:07.520]  and they're sending my 1040 form out to different services.
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:10.520]  It's OGDN, Odin Service Center,
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:14.520]  and I was wondering what that was all about.
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:17.520]  Look, they issue the money.
[2:04:17.520 --> 2:04:19.520]  They don't even need the income tax.
[2:04:19.520 --> 2:04:21.520]  It doesn't run the country.
[2:04:21.520 --> 2:04:24.520]  It's interest on the debt to the Federal Reserve
[2:04:24.520 --> 2:04:26.520]  to allow us to have money.
[2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:29.520]  Total fraud, total scam, total evil.
[2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:31.520]  There's double set of books in every government agency
[2:04:31.520 --> 2:04:33.520]  called the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:36.520]  They have thousands of trillions in their own Swiss bank accounts
[2:04:36.520 --> 2:04:39.520]  in Luxembourg and other places.
[2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:42.520]  It's an absolutely criminal degenerate system.
[2:04:46.520 --> 2:04:48.520]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:04:48.520 --> 2:04:52.520]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide,
[2:04:52.520 --> 2:04:54.520]  but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[2:04:54.520 --> 2:04:57.520]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:04:57.520 --> 2:04:59.520]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[2:04:59.520 --> 2:05:03.520]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:05:03.520 --> 2:05:07.520]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:05:07.520 --> 2:05:08.520]  In the Info War,
[2:05:08.520 --> 2:05:12.520]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[2:05:12.520 --> 2:05:15.520]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[2:05:44.520 --> 2:05:46.520]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[2:05:46.520 --> 2:05:49.520]  Hey everybody, if you're anything like me, I'll bet you like to eat.
[2:05:49.520 --> 2:05:53.520]  I like egg scrambles for breakfast, fresh homemade bread,
[2:05:53.520 --> 2:05:58.520]  delicious pastas like lasagna, I love beef stroganoff,
[2:05:58.520 --> 2:06:01.520]  I love chicken noodle soup, I love desserts,
[2:06:01.520 --> 2:06:05.520]  all kinds of entrees and soups and desserts and breakfast.
[2:06:05.520 --> 2:06:06.520]  I love that stuff.
[2:06:06.520 --> 2:06:10.520]  Now, food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices.
[2:06:10.520 --> 2:06:12.520]  I mean, the gasoline prices have gone insanely high,
[2:06:12.520 --> 2:06:13.520]  probably going to go higher.
[2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:15.520]  Grocery prices are right on their heels.
[2:06:15.520 --> 2:06:17.520]  How are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:20.520]  Well, I found a way to buy really incredible foods
[2:06:20.520 --> 2:06:24.520]  like I just described at half the price of last year's grocery bill.
[2:06:24.520 --> 2:06:27.520]  For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year,
[2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:30.520]  I can have it delivered to your door.
[2:06:30.520 --> 2:06:31.520]  Let me tell you how.

[2:07:50.520 --> 2:07:55.520]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:55.520 --> 2:07:57.520]  Blasting through your calls,
[2:07:57.520 --> 2:07:59.520]  Burmese has been ferreting about in the office.
[2:07:59.520 --> 2:08:02.520]  Literally like a ferret all morning with a bunch of news
[2:08:02.520 --> 2:08:04.520]  about the anthrax case really breaking.
[2:08:04.520 --> 2:08:07.520]  Let's go to Elliot, Ron, Jim, Richard and others.
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:09.520]  In the next segment we've got Burmese coming in.
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:12.520]  Elliot, Ohio, you're on the air worldwide in defensive humanity.
[2:08:12.520 --> 2:08:15.520]  The last ditch effort. Go ahead.
[2:08:15.520 --> 2:08:17.520]  Hey, Alex. I'm Nate Dean.
[2:08:17.520 --> 2:08:20.520]  I'm starting at the University of Cincinnati in September.
[2:08:20.520 --> 2:08:23.520]  Now, they may not read this book by this quote philosopher.
[2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:25.520]  I think he's from Africa.
[2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:28.520]  The book's called Cosmopolitanism and he flip-flops all throughout the book
[2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:30.520]  talking about, oh, I'm talking about good globalization,
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:32.520]  not the macro.
[2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:34.520]  He even said that the macroeconomic construct
[2:08:34.520 --> 2:08:37.520]  that everyone seems to fear and hate.
[2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:39.520]  Now, I'm talking about good globalization
[2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:42.520]  and the whole theme of this year is called citizenship.
[2:08:42.520 --> 2:08:44.520]  All about being a world citizen.
[2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:46.520]  I've just finished the August Reviews
[2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:48.520]  little section on global schooling,
[2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:50.520]  hijacking American education.
[2:08:50.520 --> 2:08:52.520]  And so far, I've gotten to, like,
[2:08:52.520 --> 2:08:54.520]  as soon as I go in there, I'm going to tell these people straight up
[2:08:54.520 --> 2:08:56.520]  what this is all about.
[2:08:56.520 --> 2:08:58.520]  No matter how good your essays are, you'll be given Fs.
[2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:00.520]  But if you cynically, and I did this as a test,
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:02.520]  write about how you love world government,
[2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:05.520]  you can have spelling errors that can be handwritten
[2:09:05.520 --> 2:09:07.520]  with coffee stains.
[2:09:07.520 --> 2:09:11.520]  You'll be given an A-plus and invited to sickening meetings.
[2:09:11.520 --> 2:09:13.520]  Oh, man. It's all a fraud.
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:16.520]  It's all a big scumbag joke.
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:18.520]  Yeah, man, I'm just reading like the Aspen Institute
[2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:21.520]  has the six-point plan of how to,
[2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:24.520]  and the Aspen Institute was funded by the Markle Foundation,
[2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:26.520]  which had ties to the Morgan Banking Establishment,
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:30.520]  Lloyd Morsez, the founder, I believe,
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:32.520]  of the Markle Foundation.
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:35.520]  He's the president of Carnegie Corporation.
[2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:37.520]  Morey Strong.
[2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:39.520]  Go ahead.
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:46.520]  Revised the curricula to meet the global contract.
[2:09:46.520 --> 2:09:49.520] .2, pretty much get political and educational leaders backing it.
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:51.520] .3, which I really want to bring up to them,
[2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:55.520]  is use universities and research institutions
[2:09:55.520 --> 2:09:58.520]  to develop a knowledge base on interdependence
[2:09:58.520 --> 2:10:01.520]  in order to help build political consensus
[2:10:01.520 --> 2:10:03.520]  necessary for global policies.
[2:10:03.520 --> 2:10:05.520]  And when you hear that, it means wreck all economies
[2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:07.520]  so everybody's dependent on the bankers
[2:10:07.520 --> 2:10:09.520]  that sit above the nation-state
[2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:11.520]  with a global government framework.
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:13.520]  Exactly, and I'm just asking you, Alex,
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:16.520]  like, I mean, I can throw out these points to them,
[2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:18.520]  but do you have any points that you can help me?
[2:10:18.520 --> 2:10:20.520]  Let me tell you how this will work.
[2:10:20.520 --> 2:10:22.520]  When you say you're against it,
[2:10:22.520 --> 2:10:25.520]  they will then say the textbook and the assignment didn't exist
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:27.520]  and will refer you to psychiatric care.
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:29.520]  I'm not joking.
[2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:30.520]  That actually has done a lot of universities,
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:32.520]  and I'm going to give you an F,
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:34.520]  and say you don't understand the subtleties.
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:36.520]  If you say you don't want world government,
[2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:38.520]  they will say it doesn't exist.
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:40.520]  You see, that's what they do.
[2:10:40.520 --> 2:10:42.520]  As they put in the toll roads in Texas,
[2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:44.520]  they say they don't exist.
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:48.520]  It's all about lying and fraud and mass mental illness.
[2:10:48.520 --> 2:10:50.520]  You understand?
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:53.520]  It's all scientifically engineered by top psychiatrists.
[2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:55.520]  Well, definitely.
[2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:57.520]  I'm just trying to figure out key points
[2:10:57.520 --> 2:10:59.520]  that I could at least say in class
[2:10:59.520 --> 2:11:01.520]  that maybe I can get the kids to wake up.
[2:11:01.520 --> 2:11:03.520]  Just hit them with info weapons,
[2:11:03.520 --> 2:11:05.520]  get Terror Storm Final Cut,
[2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:07.520]  make copies of it.
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:09.520]  Hit them with that.
[2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:11.520]  It's better just to totally not even engage
[2:11:11.520 --> 2:11:13.520]  their false paradigm matrix system,
[2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:15.520]  and it's just better to go in and get whoever you can save
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:18.520]  who may have already had some type of resistance
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:21.520]  into their psychological from nature matrix.
[2:11:21.520 --> 2:11:25.520]  Some of them may have had a nature true education program
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:27.520]  where they understand,
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:29.520]  they can reach them at that level,
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:31.520]  but you'll probably be able to reach out
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:33.520]  to a large portion of the class.
[2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:35.520]  I would bypass the professor if he's a minion of this,
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:37.520]  because he will then target you
[2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:39.520]  and I would carry out covert operations
[2:11:39.520 --> 2:11:41.520]  and info war against the enemy.
[2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:43.520]  Against the enemy!
[2:11:43.520 --> 2:11:45.520]  That's what they are.
[2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:47.520]  Enemies!
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:49.520]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:11:49.520 --> 2:11:51.520]  No, no, no.
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:53.520]  I'm just, this is all good stuff.
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:55.520]  I'm just going to do whatever I can.
[2:11:55.520 --> 2:11:57.520]  You're already paying for a fraud education.
[2:11:57.520 --> 2:11:59.520]  You might as well just go in there
[2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:01.520]  with the mission of wrecking their lives
[2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:03.520]  as a key info warrior.
[2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:05.520]  That's the plan.
[2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:07.520]  I'm already trying to figure out
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:09.520]  if I could start up a 9-11 truth group
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:11.520]  and you see and just start from there
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:13.520]  and just build it up.
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:15.520]  Yes.
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:17.520]  I'm sorry, I just get so...
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:19.520]  Build it up.
[2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:21.520]  We were already talking,
[2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:23.520]  we were, I was at a 9-11 Since You Truth meeting
[2:12:23.520 --> 2:12:28.700]  There's a 9-11 Sensey Truth meeting, and there's another kid that's actually in his
[2:12:28.700 --> 2:12:32.080]  like fourth, fifth year, he's about to be a doctor, me and him are going to start up
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:37.800]  or try to start up a 9-11 Truth club in UC and see where it goes from there.
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:38.800]  That's right.
[2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:40.720]  Don't waste your time with their operatives.
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:45.760]  Move in with force multiplication and absolutely deprogram.
[2:12:45.760 --> 2:12:46.760]  Good job.
[2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:47.760]  Good to hear from you.
[2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:50.400]  Sorry, I get really fired up, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:53.360]  This is absolute mortal combat with the New World Order.
[2:12:53.360 --> 2:12:54.680]  They're coming down to the wire.
[2:12:54.680 --> 2:12:56.880]  Ron in New York, thanks for holding your own the year.
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:12:58.360]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:02.240]  Alex, the story is broken within the last few days.
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:06.880]  First in Mother Jones News, now it's being carried on the AP wire and New York Newsday.
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:08.440]  I found it interesting.
[2:13:08.440 --> 2:13:15.360]  It's a story about the NRA hiring an infiltrator informant from a security company that specializes
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:18.400]  in hiring people like that to the corporate sector.
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:24.320]  I think it's PDI or SDI security in one of the mid-Atlantic states in which they hired
[2:13:24.320 --> 2:13:30.000]  the informant who was a former stewardess, airline stewardess, and sex counselor to infiltrate.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:35.320]  I believe it was handgun control incorporated or one of the Brady related or Brady anti-gun
[2:13:35.320 --> 2:13:37.520]  campaign organizations.
[2:13:37.520 --> 2:13:42.240]  Now, this raises some questions in my head while I want to make it clear to you and your
[2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:43.240]  audience.
[2:13:43.240 --> 2:13:48.720]  What role rove, reverse black propaganda, reverse psi off, false flag?
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:55.360]  I hold no truck with the Brady campaign, but I began to wonder if they've infiltrated
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:14:00.920]  them, might they not also try to place spies in legitimate pro-second amendment organizations?
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:06.200]  Well, the NRA was set up, as you know, at the end of the Civil War and was set up for
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:07.200]  gun control.
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:12.120]  In fact, I totally forgot and my stack fell off the table earlier and it's all mixed up.
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:16.760]  Karen, print me the White House Chief of Staff funding al-Qaeda groups again, secretly in
[2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:19.320]  the White House, mainstream news.
[2:14:19.320 --> 2:14:22.920]  Remember the White House Chief of Staff funding al-Qaeda?
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:23.920]  I forgot that.
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:25.360]  Bring me that article again.
[2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:26.760]  Absolutely, sir.
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:31.360]  I haven't seen the report you're talking about, but the NRA has probably done this
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:34.840]  by design to be caught to demonize the Second Amendment.
[2:14:34.840 --> 2:14:36.440]  Well, it may be.
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:38.840]  Yeah, I figure that there's a lot of skullduggery here.
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:40.640]  It's a rather weird thing to do.
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:45.000]  It's called Cloak and Dagger and you're a retired New York cop, you've been calling
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:50.120]  for years so you understand what goes on in these systems, but this is all black ops,
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:51.120]  sir.
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:52.120]  Oh, yeah.
[2:14:52.120 --> 2:14:53.120]  Yeah, no, no.
[2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:55.280]  There's definitely something more to this and it definitely smells to the high heaven
[2:14:55.280 --> 2:14:56.960]  and it's more than just the initial report.
[2:14:56.960 --> 2:15:00.920]  If you want to find it, it's in today's New York Newsday, page A6.
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:03.160]  You'll see a story there about it.
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:04.840]  But this is all going on.
[2:15:04.840 --> 2:15:09.240]  Listen, it's come to the point, I think we've got to face it, a lot of people are maybe in
[2:15:09.240 --> 2:15:12.800]  some form of denial, some of the other issues you talked about earlier.
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:14.840]  The Republic has collapsed.
[2:15:14.840 --> 2:15:16.680]  We've got to face that.
[2:15:16.680 --> 2:15:21.560]  And most Americans maybe don't recognize it because they're in some type of narcissized
[2:15:21.560 --> 2:15:23.400]  or hypnotized state.
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:27.360]  The Republic, as our fathers understood it, has collapsed.
[2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:31.280]  And yeah, at this point, it's just the point where we're just going to have to stand up
[2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:32.560]  against this.
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:37.800]  You mentioned the use of psychological warfare, yes, they have taken the psychiatric sciences
[2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:42.440]  and criminally weaponized the psychiatric sciences against the population or segments
[2:15:42.440 --> 2:15:44.840]  within the population.
[2:15:44.840 --> 2:15:50.520]  Psychiatry has been turned into a punitive whip to try and silence or censor any dissent.
[2:15:50.520 --> 2:15:51.520]  That's true.
[2:15:51.520 --> 2:15:52.520]  That's going on in math.
[2:15:52.520 --> 2:15:54.760]  Anybody that can't recognize that is blind.
[2:15:54.760 --> 2:15:56.680]  You're talking about the selling off of assets.
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:00.600]  Right here now in New York City for the first time, there's open discussion, though this
[2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:04.560]  has happened, I know in places like Texas with roads, open discussion of selling off
[2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:08.120]  bridges to corporate entities, foreign corporations.
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:12.200]  The same raping we've seen the banks carry out in third world countries at the point
[2:16:12.200 --> 2:16:14.240]  of a gun is now going to happen here.
[2:16:14.240 --> 2:16:19.800]  In fact, here in the state of New York, something I consider part of our strategic infrastructure,
[2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:24.560]  the supply of energy, natural gas energy, a company called National Grid from England
[2:16:24.560 --> 2:16:27.160]  has taken it over within the last six months.
[2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:28.960]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:34.520]  And as you mentioned a little bit ago, everybody's only worried about the minutiae of baseball
[2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:38.080]  statistics and sports statistics.
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:40.680]  What the heck is wrong with people?
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:41.680]  Are they all in denial?
[2:16:41.680 --> 2:16:46.040]  Is it a matter of not being able to confront cowardice because they realize what's going
[2:16:46.040 --> 2:16:47.800]  on but they don't want to address it?
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:53.000]  To realize we're living in the middle of a nightmare science fiction novel and to realize
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:58.500]  they're carrying out eugenics against us, Ron, the people, I can't say they're not
[2:16:58.500 --> 2:16:59.500]  waking up.
[2:16:59.500 --> 2:17:04.280]  They're waking up, but it's taken me 15 years, 13 years on air.
[2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:11.800]  To finally, every week, fully more admit that I haven't been exaggerating to myself, that
[2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:17.400]  I haven't been overestimating, that I underestimated, and now it's just everything's coming out
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:18.840]  and it freaks me out, man.
[2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:20.960]  I mean, it freaks me out.
[2:17:20.960 --> 2:17:24.840]  Like you mentioned, they're now throwing the gauntlet down in your face.
[2:17:24.840 --> 2:17:27.360]  They're not even putting on the pretense anymore.
[2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:31.480]  They started this program, well, the program started a long time back, but they feel so
[2:17:31.480 --> 2:17:36.400]  powerful now that I would say that probably since the 1990s, they've just been jamming
[2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:39.440]  it in our faces and just saying, hey, we're going to do this, and what are you going to
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:40.640]  do about it?
[2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:41.880]  That's basically what it's come down to.
[2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:42.880]  Let me ask you this.
[2:17:42.880 --> 2:17:45.200]  You know a lot of the current New York cops.
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:49.040]  When I went to New York when I was a kid and then a teenager, the police were nice.
[2:17:49.040 --> 2:17:53.000]  Now, and I saw it in D.C. this year, and I wasn't looking for it.
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:58.040]  I mean, I would see a field, and I would see people sitting down, having a picnic.
[2:17:58.040 --> 2:18:02.440]  I'd see families looking at a marker, and cops would just come over.
[2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:03.440]  Security guards were even worse.
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:04.680]  They'd just yell at them, meanly.
[2:18:04.680 --> 2:18:08.400]  They've clearly been told to do this in New York, and I've talked to Austin cops who visited
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:09.400]  New York.
[2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:10.400]  It's happened to them, even cops.
[2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:14.040]  They'll just come over and scream at you and treat you like filth, and they've been
[2:18:14.040 --> 2:18:18.320]  told to throw the book at citizens for no reason, and warrantless checkpoints and gun
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:20.560]  sweeps and just all of it.
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:23.040]  I mean, do you talk to any of these cops that are currently cops?
[2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:27.120]  Well, no, because basically the new crop of officers, they're not that new.
[2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:30.360]  The officers that started coming into the organization in the 1990s.
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:32.480]  That's when this really started full bore.
[2:18:32.480 --> 2:18:37.000]  They're not police officers so much as they are paramilitarists.
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:40.880]  This is really what they've replaced your local cop with with a paramilitarist.
[2:18:40.880 --> 2:18:45.120]  You've got the equivalent of a paramilitarist like they might have police and what we used
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:47.880]  to laugh at as, you know, a repressive banana republic.
[2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:48.880]  Guatemala.
[2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:49.880]  And now have that here.
[2:18:49.880 --> 2:18:53.360]  In New York City, New York City, I mean, I don't know if people are aware of this.
[2:18:53.360 --> 2:18:58.120]  This place, the police department here has got such a close association with the CIA.
[2:18:58.120 --> 2:19:02.600]  You have a former, a high official from the CIA by the name of David Cohen, who's running
[2:19:02.600 --> 2:19:05.480]  operations intelligence operations within the police department.
[2:19:05.480 --> 2:19:08.480]  It's almost a listening post for Washington for the feds.
[2:19:08.480 --> 2:19:13.280]  Hell, we have Israel, Israel everywhere, basically running the departments now.
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:16.920]  Well, you have, you have a lot of interaction.
[2:19:16.920 --> 2:19:20.720]  You have a lot of interaction with overseas governments.
[2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:26.080]  You have the NYPD engaging in a lot of overseas intelligence operations, this is a city police
[2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:30.360]  agency conducting itself like it's a national security agency.
[2:19:30.360 --> 2:19:34.880]  All under the rubric of terrorism and meanwhile, it's the government that did the terror.
[2:19:34.880 --> 2:19:39.200]  And perpetrating a lot of misbehavior, there's no doubt about that.
[2:19:39.200 --> 2:19:40.200]  Anything else, Ron?
[2:19:40.200 --> 2:19:41.200]  That's about it.
[2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:42.700]  But check into that with the NRA.
[2:19:42.700 --> 2:19:44.200]  I certainly hope as I said.
[2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:45.200]  We're out of time.
[2:19:45.200 --> 2:19:47.560]  Good to hear from you.
[2:19:47.560 --> 2:19:52.840]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[2:19:52.840 --> 2:19:56.720]  on and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[2:19:56.720 --> 2:20:02.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:03.560]  to tell their story.
[2:20:03.560 --> 2:20:12.600]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:20:12.600 --> 2:20:17.360]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[2:20:17.360 --> 2:20:19.640]  take action against their global masters.
[2:20:19.640 --> 2:20:22.800]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:28.600]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:20:28.600 --> 2:20:32.120]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[2:20:32.120 --> 2:20:37.960]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[2:20:37.960 --> 2:20:40.600]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:20:40.600 --> 2:20:44.280]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[2:20:44.280 --> 2:20:47.800]  and bring in martial law.
[2:20:47.800 --> 2:20:51.560]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the US
[2:20:51.560 --> 2:20:53.160]  dollar has been devaluating.
[2:20:53.160 --> 2:20:56.960]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[2:20:56.960 --> 2:20:59.880]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[2:20:59.880 --> 2:21:01.960]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[2:21:01.960 --> 2:21:05.280]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[2:21:05.280 --> 2:21:12.120]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them
[2:21:12.120 --> 2:21:17.480]  both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[2:21:17.480 --> 2:21:21.000]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:23.160]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[2:21:47.320 --> 2:21:52.360]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[2:21:52.360 --> 2:21:56.080]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:21:56.080 --> 2:22:01.080]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[2:22:01.080 --> 2:22:04.440]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:22:04.440 --> 2:22:09.200]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[2:22:09.200 --> 2:22:10.200]  across America.
[2:22:10.200 --> 2:22:14.200]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:22:14.200 --> 2:22:18.200]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier
[2:22:18.200 --> 2:22:19.200]  I feel.
[2:22:19.200 --> 2:22:21.520]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:26.720]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventive
[2:22:26.720 --> 2:22:29.240]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:22:46.600 --> 2:22:50.040]  Alabama State Code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[2:22:50.040 --> 2:22:53.760]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:57.960]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[2:22:57.960 --> 2:23:02.240]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:05.360]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:11.120]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional and cost you valuable time and money.
[2:23:11.120 --> 2:23:15.600]  Sprayyourplate.com is a spray on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras, toll

[2:23:56.160 --> 2:23:58.760]  More of your phone calls straight ahead.
[2:23:58.760 --> 2:24:05.640]  Bermas will be riding shotgun with us a bit today, I've got infowars.com, company business,
[2:24:05.640 --> 2:24:08.040]  I have to work on Friday, they'll be sitting in.
[2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:09.600]  Bermas, you want to go do the Sunday show?
[2:24:09.600 --> 2:24:11.920]  You want to do the Sunday show too?
[2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:14.280]  Yeah, that would be awesome actually, I'd love to do the Sunday show.
[2:24:14.280 --> 2:24:15.280]  They've been here an hour before.
[2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:16.280]  I can do that.
[2:24:16.280 --> 2:24:17.280]  Awesome.
[2:24:17.280 --> 2:24:18.280]  Very cool.
[2:24:18.280 --> 2:24:19.280]  You've done well.
[2:24:19.280 --> 2:24:20.280]  Awesome.
[2:24:20.280 --> 2:24:25.600]  We've got really serious news here in front of us, recap the basics for those that don't
[2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:30.440]  know the basics of the indirect story first and then get into these new developments.
[2:24:30.440 --> 2:24:31.440]  Sure.
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:36.120]  Let's start with Steven Hatfield at the end of June, I believe it was.
[2:24:36.120 --> 2:24:41.120]  He was exonerated, he won $5.8 million against the Justice Department and FBI for trying to
[2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:42.120]  set him up.
[2:24:42.120 --> 2:24:47.800]  Now, I think it's only been about a week, week and a half since this guy Bruce Ivan supposedly
[2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:51.160]  quote unquote killed himself and everything in the mainstream media, even some of the
[2:24:51.160 --> 2:24:54.880]  alternative press, semi-alternative press like Raw Story, always starts with that.
[2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:57.520]  No one questions whether the man killed himself.
[2:24:57.520 --> 2:25:01.520]  And it's like a secret that he died in the mental institution when they were about to
[2:25:01.520 --> 2:25:05.760]  release him saying the FBI was wrong, he wasn't crazy, and the lady that said this about him
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:06.760]  was incredible.
[2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:09.120]  That's buried in only a few mainstream news reports.
[2:25:09.120 --> 2:25:12.680]  Remember, the FBI still saying it isn't weaponized anthrax, they've already tried to blame two
[2:25:12.680 --> 2:25:13.840]  other people.
[2:25:13.840 --> 2:25:17.720]  Now they say they knew he did it years ago, this new guy that killed himself, but that
[2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:22.600]  they were still going to charge Steven Hatfield, so they're not even getting their timelines
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:23.600]  right.
[2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:25.080]  That's information.
[2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:30.360]  Well, it seems that the woman that actually, well, said that he was crazy and got the restraining
[2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:35.720]  order against him is an ex-motorcycle gang member that was quoted in the Washington Post,
[2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:37.560]  under a separate name by the way.
[2:25:37.560 --> 2:25:44.120]  Her name is really, let's read this, it is not Dooley, it is actually Gene Whitman.
[2:25:44.120 --> 2:25:45.120]  Not Gene Dooley.
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:46.120]  Definitely an intelligence.
[2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:51.200]  Well, let's just read the quote, in 1999 interview with the Washington Post, Dooley described
[2:25:51.200 --> 2:25:55.160]  her background as a motorcycle gang member and a drug user.
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:26:00.400]  Okay, heroin, cocaine, PCP, you name it, I did it.
[2:26:00.400 --> 2:26:04.920]  And you and I both know they love to recruit people with substance abuse problems because
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:07.200]  it's very easy to control these people.
[2:26:07.200 --> 2:26:11.600]  Now on top of this woman putting him in the mental institution, this is where he dies,
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:17.320]  it now comes out that the FBI had offered his son $2.5 million and the sports car of
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:22.040]  his choice to try to give evidence that would have convicted his father.
[2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:26.000]  And that's mainstream news and this is before they dropped the stuff on Hadfield.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:29.920]  So should they know Hadfield's innocent, meanwhile they're trying to frame this other guy and
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:33.000]  then all his colleagues are saying he didn't work with the weaponized anthrax.
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:36.360]  He couldn't have done this in a kernel, one of the heads of one of the labs is saying
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:37.640]  this is a cover-up.
[2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:38.640]  Absolutely.
[2:26:38.640 --> 2:26:40.320]  And now if you go further into the article.
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:43.800]  Meanwhile there's a guy who broke in with ties to intelligence to the level four bio
[2:26:43.800 --> 2:26:46.600]  weapons lab, Lieutenant Colonel Zach and he's not being talked to.
[2:26:46.600 --> 2:26:47.600]  That's right.
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:51.440]  Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Zach was in a restricted area when he wasn't supposed to be had no
[2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:55.840]  clearance, had been fired and then it looked like he tried to frame up, I believe his
[2:26:55.840 --> 2:26:56.840]  name was Assad.
[2:26:56.840 --> 2:26:57.840]  Yeah.
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:00.640]  Yeah, it's pretty unbelievable and this guy is no longer a person of interest.
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:05.240]  And now the FBI is claiming that after seven years it's closed.
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:06.600]  The case has been solved.
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:10.440]  It was this guy, but they're going to leave it open for a little while until they bring
[2:27:10.440 --> 2:27:11.440]  it up.
[2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:14.400]  But in the court of public opinion, this guy has already been convicted.
[2:27:14.400 --> 2:27:15.400]  I have not seen anything.
[2:27:15.400 --> 2:27:18.680]  I mean, I think the best thing I saw was Overman and it was really light.
[2:27:18.680 --> 2:27:22.760]  I mean, people should really be saying, hey, this guy was murdered.
[2:27:22.760 --> 2:27:26.960]  You don't come out after the fact, after a man is dead and then blame him for this type
[2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:29.960]  of attack, not allowing him to defend himself.
[2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:32.320]  And now it turns out the media has been quoting this psychiatrist.
[2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:33.520]  She's not even that.
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:35.680]  She's some government informant with a fake name.
[2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:36.680]  Exactly.
[2:27:36.680 --> 2:27:37.680]  She's got a fake name.
[2:27:37.680 --> 2:27:40.280]  And they're running around offering millions of dollars in sports cars.
[2:27:40.280 --> 2:27:41.280]  Yes.
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:42.280]  And not only that, but they also went to his doctor.
[2:27:42.280 --> 2:27:43.800]  I want to know right now what she was given.
[2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:44.800]  Yeah.
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:45.800]  What she was given to.
[2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:47.640]  I'm sure it was a pile of cocaine.
[2:27:47.640 --> 2:27:49.200]  They love drug addicts.
[2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:52.400]  They're so easy to handle and they'll do whatever you say.
[2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:57.040]  Now they also went to his daughter and they showed her victims of anthrax that didn't make
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:00.080]  it, that died and said your father was responsible for this.
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:03.080]  Of course, the daughter thought that they were nuts, said there was no evidence that
[2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:05.960]  her father was involved, but they still tried to press her.
[2:28:05.960 --> 2:28:10.200]  Now on top of that, it comes out that he was concerned that they were stalking his family
[2:28:10.200 --> 2:28:12.160]  on shopping trips and all these other things.
[2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:15.760]  See, they're saying he's crazy now, but it turns out they were stalking them.
[2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:16.760]  Yeah.
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:17.760]  Exactly.
[2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:18.760]  See, that's another thing.
[2:28:18.760 --> 2:28:22.600]  They always pin somebody as mentally unstable or insane no matter how much evidence that
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:26.360]  it's not paranoid delusion, it's they're actually being followed.
[2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:27.360]  You know, they tried the same thing.
[2:28:27.360 --> 2:28:28.360]  Yeah, they admit he's crazy.
[2:28:28.360 --> 2:28:30.080]  He thought he was being followed, but he was being followed.
[2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:32.720]  It's just like when Gary Webb supposedly shot himself twice in the face.
[2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:35.880]  Hey, I've seen government files 20 years ago where they'd be surveilling someone and
[2:28:35.880 --> 2:28:38.920]  they'd say the professor is paranoid, probably schizophrenic.
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:40.400]  He believes he's being listened to.
[2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:41.400]  They're listening.
[2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:42.400]  They're listening.
[2:28:42.400 --> 2:28:43.400]  Exactly.
[2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:46.760]  So, you know, I always joke on the phone at home, I go, oh, I'm crazy.
[2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:47.760]  I think you're listening.
[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:50.480]  I go, and you actually put that in your files that I'm crazy.
[2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:52.040]  I think I'm being listened to when you're listening.
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:53.040]  Yeah.
[2:28:53.040 --> 2:28:56.720]  Well, I mean, just look at some of the top journalists around that were, you know, surveilled
[2:28:56.720 --> 2:28:57.720]  by the FBI.
[2:28:57.720 --> 2:28:58.720]  It came out only a few years ago.
[2:28:58.720 --> 2:29:02.920]  The guys like Britt Hume, who's now on the Fox News Network, was surveilled for years.
[2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:07.680]  They always CIA was surveilling him and FBI, but it's also come out that the entire British
[2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:11.680]  parliament illegally is being surveilled by the Queen through MI6.
[2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:12.680]  Everything they do.
[2:29:12.680 --> 2:29:13.680]  Yeah.
[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:14.680]  That's hardly democracy.
[2:29:14.680 --> 2:29:16.200]  That's hardly parliamentary procedure.
[2:29:16.200 --> 2:29:17.200]  It's really a dictatorship.
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:18.200]  Yeah.
[2:29:18.200 --> 2:29:22.480]  It's a criminal, private corporations that own and run the executive branch and everything
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:24.520]  else is being dissolved right now.
[2:29:24.520 --> 2:29:27.400]  Congress says, let us see the documents in your continuity government plan.
[2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:28.400]  Bush says, no.
[2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:37.640]  We'll be right back with Burma's and your phone calls.
[2:29:37.640 --> 2:29:47.720]  Here on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:29:47.720 --> 2:29:50.080]  It is a big idea.
[2:29:50.080 --> 2:29:53.880]  A new world order in the near future.
[2:29:53.880 --> 2:30:00.560]  Earth is dominated by powerful government is known as the builder bird put their objective
[2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:03.880]  being world domination or thousands of years.
[2:30:03.880 --> 2:30:08.600]  Their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order.
[2:30:08.600 --> 2:30:16.880]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand for the first time in
[2:30:16.880 --> 2:30:17.880]  history.
[2:30:17.880 --> 2:30:21.480]  The elites plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:30:21.480 --> 2:30:25.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:28.040]  The old bird is making great progress toward the world.
[2:30:28.040 --> 2:30:29.040]  Most people have no idea.
[2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:30.040]  They're not after money.
[2:30:30.040 --> 2:30:31.040]  They have all the money they need.
[2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:32.040]  They're after power.

[2:31:46.480 --> 2:31:49.480]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[2:31:49.480 --> 2:31:54.000]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days many will be deceived.
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:57.600]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[2:31:57.600 --> 2:32:01.240]  What do you know about the beast, its mark and the antichrist?
[2:32:01.240 --> 2:32:05.180]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[2:32:05.180 --> 2:32:10.440]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card or 666?
[2:32:10.440 --> 2:32:13.520]  Is the antichrist a person, title or both?
[2:32:13.520 --> 2:32:17.320]  Some believe these things are in the future, others believe that it's in the past.
[2:32:17.320 --> 2:32:20.680]  First John states the antichrist is already in the world.
[2:32:20.680 --> 2:32:22.760]  What is the truth and what is a lie?
[2:32:22.760 --> 2:32:25.360]  Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?
[2:32:25.360 --> 2:32:30.200]  Because these answers are in the Bible for free books, DVDs and Bible studies exposing
[2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:36.400]  the antichrist, the beast and its mark right to the Bible says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee
[2:32:36.400 --> 2:32:58.840]  37771 or call 888-211-1715, that's 888-211-1715.
[2:32:58.840 --> 2:33:14.120]  Is it getting better or do you feel the same, will it make it easier on you now, you got
[2:33:14.120 --> 2:33:26.800]  someone to blame, 1-800-259-9231, one life when it's one need, in the night, you know
[2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:31.600]  I'm glad my life means something, glad I'm not just another mindless sports fan, has
[2:33:31.600 --> 2:33:37.480]  no idea what's happening around them, I'm thankful to my family, my parents that brought
[2:33:37.480 --> 2:33:42.280]  me up right, I'm so blessed to know all of you and all the great people in this movement
[2:33:42.280 --> 2:33:47.080]  for liberty, you know I sound pretty angry and hardcore sometimes because we know what's
[2:33:47.080 --> 2:33:51.840]  going on, we understand the enemies M.O., we study them constantly, we live, eat and
[2:33:51.840 --> 2:33:56.480]  breathe this and you get to a higher level of knowledge when you go off the real facts,
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:34:04.680]  the real info, enemy paradigms, enemy operations, enemy signatures, when you learn their sociology,
[2:34:04.680 --> 2:34:08.480]  their criminology, that's how we can predict things, that's how we know what's going to
[2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:11.680]  happen, I mean look at the track record we've got, look at what we can do, I can go on air
[2:34:11.680 --> 2:34:15.720]  and say they're probably about to attack the World Trade Center, call the White House,
[2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:19.120]  tell them don't do it, I did that one time, it happened that one time because I saw the
[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:24.440]  enemy preparing the slaves for the attack, introducing bin Laden to the public, I knew
[2:34:24.440 --> 2:34:27.240]  the feds would try to blow it up once and fail, they were going to come back to the
[2:34:27.240 --> 2:34:30.760]  scene of the crime, it's like bank robbers that have failed to rob a bank will come rob
[2:34:30.760 --> 2:34:36.640]  it ten years later, it's full spectrum warfare with the New World Order ladies and gentlemen,
[2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:39.920]  all of us are together in this except for a few thousand globalists, this is not good
[2:34:39.920 --> 2:34:46.520]  for anybody, it's time to stop denying, police, military and others, come in, join the team,
[2:34:46.520 --> 2:34:51.280]  that doesn't mean call us, support us, that means you start educating, you start researching,
[2:34:51.280 --> 2:34:56.360]  you start finding out how serious things are, I want to go to your calls, Jim and Richard,
[2:34:56.360 --> 2:35:02.720]  many others that are patiently holding, but Bermas, we now have bin Laden's driver who
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:07.160]  has been convicted but for none of the real terrorism, but meanwhile they had bin Laden's
[2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:11.480]  right hand man, his bodyguard, the special forces picked up, they sent him to Guantanamo
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:16.320]  and released him in a week quietly, just like the air lift of evil, reported on financial
[2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:21.680]  times of London AP Reuters, it's all in my film, 9-11 the road to tyranny made six and
[2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:26.320]  a half years ago, all the mainstream news just saying, oh yeah, they put 6,000 Taliban
[2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:31.240]  al-Qaeda commanders on planes, gave them money, flew them out and dropped them off to safety
[2:35:31.240 --> 2:35:36.440]  and now they're in Pakistan, oh we can't get bin Laden, this is such a sick joke, Bermas
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:37.440]  give us the latest.
[2:35:37.440 --> 2:35:42.960]  Yeah, there's a guy named Salim Hamdan and this is the bin Laden driver slash bodyguard
[2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:48.040]  who is now on his third show trial, he was actually exonerated in two other show trials,
[2:35:48.040 --> 2:35:51.120]  then our lovely Supreme Court ruled that he could be tried yet again.
[2:35:51.120 --> 2:35:53.040]  Oh, double triple quadruple Jeopardy.
[2:35:53.040 --> 2:35:56.320]  Absolutely, we do have a thing called double Jeopardy in this country that you can't be
[2:35:56.320 --> 2:36:00.920]  tried for the same crime twice, however, since Mr. Hamdan is not a US citizen and just somebody
[2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:04.640]  they picked up in the war on terror, he's basically a guinea pig where they can try
[2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:06.080]  anything they like out on him.
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:10.280]  And let's be clear, even with their handpicked kangaroo systems, they can't get convictions.
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:15.560]  Now, yeah, absolutely, this is a military tribunal of six, it should be pretty easy.
[2:36:15.560 --> 2:36:18.640]  Showing our military is good people at the mid levels.
[2:36:18.640 --> 2:36:22.120]  Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, most people in the military have no idea what's going on, they
[2:36:22.120 --> 2:36:24.120]  think they're really fighting terrorism, they really think they're...
[2:36:24.120 --> 2:36:26.960]  And we've interviewed some of them, I mean, it's like General Rick Bakas, the head of
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:31.480]  Camp X-ray, resigned four years ago and said, we're torturing people to death in here and
[2:36:31.480 --> 2:36:34.800]  by the way, they're 14-year-old innocent kids and we released the real Al Qaeda and now
[2:36:34.800 --> 2:36:35.800]  it's come out they do.
[2:36:35.800 --> 2:36:37.800]  He said, I'm not going to torture children.
[2:36:37.800 --> 2:36:41.960]  Yeah, and thank God for people like him that are willing to step up, it's only unfortunate
[2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:45.840]  that they speak at one whistleblower's hearing, C-SPAN covers it and that's it, the mainstream
[2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:47.880]  media ignores it completely.
[2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:52.640]  But what I found really interesting about this case is that he was convicted of driving
[2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:54.200]  bin Laden, that's it.
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:59.880]  They literally found him not guilty of planning to attack civilians, planning to carry out
[2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:04.040]  attacks, planning to aid Al Qaeda in any fashion where they would carry out an attack.
[2:37:04.040 --> 2:37:05.040]  What they convicted him of...
[2:37:05.040 --> 2:37:10.080]  Well, that's because they can't put on trial any real Al Qaeda because that's their operatives.
[2:37:10.080 --> 2:37:11.080]  Yeah.
[2:37:11.080 --> 2:37:14.680]  In fact, hundreds of times, Special Forces has been in the news, just caught real ones
[2:37:14.680 --> 2:37:18.440]  and they're told, you let them go and colonels have thrown fits in and called the media.
[2:37:18.440 --> 2:37:21.920]  Of course, then they have correction time.
[2:37:21.920 --> 2:37:25.520]  Basically this man was convicted of being a limo driver for a billionaire, okay?
[2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:29.960]  That's what Osama bin Laden was to him, he is a Saudi billionaire, probably pretty popular
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:33.720]  in the country at that time and he just thought, hey, this is a good gig, you know, I can feed
[2:37:33.720 --> 2:37:34.720]  my family.
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:39.320]  That would be pretty much the equivalent of somebody who drives a limousine for a living
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:41.680]  and having maybe Henry Kissinger as a client.
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:44.840]  All he's doing is driving him around, he has no idea what's going on.
[2:37:44.840 --> 2:37:48.080]  So they're going to put this guy in jail for the rest of his life and call it a big victory
[2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:51.600]  for the war on terror and I'm sure the New York Times, the New York Post are all going
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:57.240]  to blow it up when again, this guy, let me repeat this, this guy got convicted of driving
[2:37:57.240 --> 2:37:59.040]  a limousine and nothing else.
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:01.320]  That's how he, quote, unquote, aided Al Qaeda.
[2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:05.640]  He didn't sit in a room and talk about blowing stuff up, he didn't get any bomb material,
[2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:10.400]  he didn't plan attacks against the World Trade Center in Pentagon, he simply drove a car
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:13.640]  and now he will literally spend the rest of his life in a torture chamber.
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:16.920]  And it didn't take one trial, it didn't take two trials, it took three trials.
[2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:23.600]  Three trials under the military, not even a jury trial, six people and it was so garbled
[2:38:23.600 --> 2:38:27.600]  when they actually convicted him that the judge had to go and get a highlighter and
[2:38:27.600 --> 2:38:28.600]  highlight certain-
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:32.560]  And the prosecutors keep slipping up going, well, when we shot down Flight 93 and they
[2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:36.080]  go, and it's not, be quiet, the intelligence officer's got classified.
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:40.760]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, they talked about the United 93 during his trial.
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:44.400]  You know, I just hope people wake up, you know, this is not keeping us safer in any
[2:38:44.400 --> 2:38:45.400]  way, shape or form.
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:47.560]  Oh yes, it is, Al Qaeda's real.
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:48.960]  This guy's a driver, that's it.
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:51.400]  I mean, this is not a top lieutenant, this isn't a hardcore killer.
[2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:55.840]  Because they can't burn CIA agents or their assets, they can't have a real Al Qaeda.
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:38:58.600]  And I mean, how many times have they killed different Al Qaeda leaders?
[2:38:58.600 --> 2:39:01.840]  And they never say, well, we didn't kill him last time, we killed him this new time.
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:04.000]  It's just on purpose, they set this precedent of lying.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:10.800]  I think my favorite one was when Zarkawi escaped an attempt to kill him with one leg on a motorcycle.
[2:39:10.800 --> 2:39:11.800]  That was my favorite one.
[2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:13.880]  He literally had to shoot out with a-
[2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:17.360]  Or in your new film, Fabled Enemies, coming out in only three weeks, folks.
[2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:20.000]  We make films so fast now and so good, but we don't have time to plug them.
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  That's true.
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  They just come out.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:25.800]  This film is really controversial, but you got the news in there admitting, oh, uh,
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:28.520]  there were all these hijackers on board planes, but the police would show up and they would
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:29.720]  disappear off the planes.
[2:39:29.720 --> 2:39:30.720]  Yeah.
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:31.720]  What you're talking about is Flight 23.
[2:39:31.720 --> 2:39:35.440]  And for those that don't know, Flight 23 had these four guys on it.
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:37.320]  They looked like they were supposedly going to hijack the plane.
[2:39:37.320 --> 2:39:39.320]  Taking part again in a CIA takeover drill.
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:40.720]  Absol- Listen, these guys-
[2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:41.720]  Ushered off by police.
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:42.720]  Exactly.
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:43.720]  These guys were protected.
[2:39:43.720 --> 2:39:45.400]  The, uh, pilot was right.
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:46.960]  You know, he said, I'm not taking off.
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:48.640]  He saw- he thought something was wrong.
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:50.040]  He asked everybody to get off the plane.
[2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:52.080]  These guys refused to get off the plane.
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:53.760]  Then finally, everybody starts getting ushered out.
[2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:55.200]  Now these guys don't take their bags.
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:56.400]  They just leave the airport.
[2:39:56.400 --> 2:39:58.000]  Like you said, magically disappear.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:39:59.280]  Apparently there's no tapes.
[2:39:59.280 --> 2:40:00.760]  There's no ways to find these guys.
[2:40:00.760 --> 2:40:01.760]  They look in their bags.
[2:40:01.760 --> 2:40:07.720]  Alex, magically al-Qaeda training manuals, tapes, blueprints, the same exact thing they
[2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:10.320]  find in Ada's, uh, suitcase.
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:11.320]  Now again-
[2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:13.720]  Which is the only bag that doesn't make it on the conveyor and sticks.
[2:40:13.720 --> 2:40:14.720]  Let's, let's make this clear.
[2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:17.720]  And then two passports magically fall out of the flames of the towers.
[2:40:17.720 --> 2:40:19.240]  Not one, but two.
[2:40:19.240 --> 2:40:22.000]  Ada is, uh, on a transcontinental flight folks.
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  Okay.
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  This is from Boston to Portland.
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:26.360]  Magically, this never happens.
[2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:28.560]  His bag doesn't make the plane.
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:31.600]  So then when they open his bag, the same exact things are found.
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:33.480]  Now this is the interesting thing.
[2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:37.600]  That's where they found the identification for most of the hijackers and Ada's associates.
[2:40:37.600 --> 2:40:41.200]  Now when the FBI turns around and finds these other bags with these four other hijackers,
[2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:44.260]  they say, oh, they were using false identification.
[2:40:44.260 --> 2:40:46.560]  So there's no way for us to find these guys.
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:50.680]  Now if these four guys are involved and they're using false identification, why wouldn't the
[2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:51.840]  other 19?
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:53.980]  It makes absolutely no sense.
[2:40:53.980 --> 2:40:57.520]  But then they get off the plane and no one stops them, even though police were at the
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:40:58.520]  gate.
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:40:59.520]  Yeah.
[2:40:59.520 --> 2:41:00.520]  Nobody stops them.
[2:41:00.520 --> 2:41:01.520]  They're able to walk right out.
[2:41:01.520 --> 2:41:05.360]  And this was reported for about a week, about a week in the mainstream media and then just
[2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:09.040]  falls off into the distance and nobody ever talks about it again.
[2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:10.400]  It's the same thing with James Woods.
[2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:14.720]  I want you to talk about run through fabled enemies because you've been working on this
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:16.800]  yourself privately for about a year.
[2:41:16.800 --> 2:41:18.520]  You came down here the last three, four months.
[2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:23.280]  We've put it together where it would have been done a few days ago, but we're rushing to
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:26.280]  add some new information about the latest anthrax.
[2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:27.280]  We already have an anthrax section.
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:33.360]  We want to add this newest info, also the Cheney wanting to attack our own ships, mainstream
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:34.360]  news.
[2:41:34.360 --> 2:41:35.360]  We're putting that in there.
[2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:39.280]  But run over what's in fabled enemies, folks, because this is coming out September 1st.
[2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:42.280]  You're going to be able to watch it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:45.360]  And let me tell you, it's got the Israeli section.
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:46.360]  It has got it all.
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:47.360]  Yeah.
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:50.560]  A lot of people have always said to me on these trips when I go and show a loose change
[2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:51.760]  or I talk to people.
[2:41:51.760 --> 2:41:53.800]  Well, you show what didn't happen, Jason.
[2:41:53.800 --> 2:41:55.880]  Why aren't you showing what did happen?
[2:41:55.880 --> 2:41:57.520]  And I said, well, you know, that's, that's true.
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:41:59.280]  I mean, we've cut a lot out of these movies.
[2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:03.720]  Maybe it's time to make a film where we can point the finger at certain entities.
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:07.560]  So and, and, and by the way, I've been there, people said, why haven't you made a film about
[2:42:07.560 --> 2:42:08.560]  the Israelis?
[2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:11.760]  Well, you guys dealing had made one film by himself in a laptop.
[2:42:11.760 --> 2:42:12.760]  That was the first edition.
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:15.520]  Then he made the second edition with you and Corey.
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:16.680]  Okay.
[2:42:16.680 --> 2:42:19.720]  And that was about control demolition and all the main issues.
[2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:21.320]  And then now this is the third film.
[2:42:21.320 --> 2:42:22.880]  This is your film.
[2:42:22.880 --> 2:42:25.520]  And you know, you guys have only been on the scene three years, two and a half years.
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:26.840]  You've been on the scene two years.
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:27.840]  So this is it.
[2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:28.840]  We're doing it.
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:29.840]  Yeah.
[2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:30.840]  So we're doing it.
[2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:31.840]  I mean, I just didn't have the means before.
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:35.720]  And this really shows just from the get go, the intelligence ties of the hijackers, the
[2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:39.720]  ones that lived with FBI informants, the ones that were trained on US bases, the ones that
[2:42:39.720 --> 2:42:40.720]  were protected.
[2:42:40.720 --> 2:42:41.720]  By the way, we bought this news footage.
[2:42:41.720 --> 2:42:44.320]  We actually went and bought it from AP and others.
[2:42:44.320 --> 2:42:46.040]  I mean, these movies are losing money now.
[2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:48.760]  I'm not very proud of that, but they're, but they're winning hearts and minds that
[2:42:48.760 --> 2:42:49.760]  what matters.
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:50.760]  That's what makes me mad.
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:53.160]  I mean, he's making money off these films and I put them out for free on Google and
[2:42:53.160 --> 2:42:54.160]  YouTube.
[2:42:54.160 --> 2:42:55.800]  They're in high quality at present planet.tv.
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:42:56.800]  You're here.
[2:42:56.800 --> 2:42:58.280]  These films now are big money losers.
[2:42:58.280 --> 2:42:59.280]  You know why?
[2:42:59.280 --> 2:43:00.680]  Because we are doing these things by the book.
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:06.280]  We're buying all the music, having it composed, buying the footage, doing it all, paying people.
[2:43:06.280 --> 2:43:11.240]  I ended up trying to pay most the activists that gave us footage for a truth rising and
[2:43:11.240 --> 2:43:12.240]  they're losing money.
[2:43:12.240 --> 2:43:14.480]  I just folks, I need you to buy truth rising.
[2:43:14.480 --> 2:43:17.680]  I get so busy covering news now, I don't even plug them up to buy them.
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:20.560]  Please go to info wars.com and go crazy and buy a bunch of stuff.
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:25.400]  You want to support us because, uh, because Burma's, I don't want to get back into the
[2:43:25.400 --> 2:43:27.560]  film, but we're going to go back to calls on the wall, but I want to go ahead and just
[2:43:27.560 --> 2:43:34.800]  bring this up because I saw you guys in New York two years ago, hand out 20,000 DVDs you
[2:43:34.800 --> 2:43:37.280]  paid like 65 cents a piece for.
[2:43:37.280 --> 2:43:43.720]  I watched you guys, uh, uh, paying a few staff people, flying all over the country, hardly
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:48.960]  selling any DVDs, uh, on your website and I said, guys, you, I go, how much money on
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:49.960]  the bank?
[2:43:49.960 --> 2:43:54.800]  I said, you're going to end up being broke and you guys are broke now.
[2:43:54.800 --> 2:43:56.680]  You guys, folks, we're not joking about this.
[2:43:56.680 --> 2:43:58.640]  Um, I don't want to get into it.
[2:43:58.640 --> 2:44:02.880]  It's, it's, but I mean, it's, it's, I don't want to get point is you need to go to info
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:05.320]  wars.com and buy loose change, final cut.
[2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:10.840]  You need to go to, um, info wars.com and get truth rising when this fable enemies comes
[2:44:10.840 --> 2:44:11.840]  up because it's a great film.
[2:44:11.840 --> 2:44:15.120]  You need to buy it, but also because Burma's is breaking off and trying to have his own
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:16.400]  film production company.
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:19.800]  We did him a favor and got him down here with two editors to finish this up quick because
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:24.760]  Burma's literally out giving him like a hundred dollars a week, he eats big bites from seven
[2:44:24.760 --> 2:44:25.760]  11.
[2:44:25.760 --> 2:44:26.840]  I'm not trying to be mean here, Burma's.
[2:44:26.840 --> 2:44:32.280]  It's just so sick to know how destitute you guys are.
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:35.520]  And then meanwhile, all this, you've given this incredible films to the public and all
[2:44:35.520 --> 2:44:37.160]  this crap about you being rich.
[2:44:37.160 --> 2:44:38.160]  Yeah.
[2:44:38.160 --> 2:44:40.040]  Well, everybody who knows me knows that I'm not rich.
[2:44:40.040 --> 2:44:43.400]  I mean, the first two months I've stayed out here, I stayed on an air mattress in a room
[2:44:43.400 --> 2:44:44.400]  that was 90 degrees.
[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:45.960]  I mean, that's not what it's about to me.
[2:44:45.960 --> 2:44:49.040]  It's about me getting this information out to other people and I could care less if
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:50.040]  I die a popper.
[2:44:50.040 --> 2:44:52.040]  Alex, I mean, I really, that's not what I'm in it for.
[2:44:52.040 --> 2:44:55.280]  I mean, we literally gave away DVDs to every single family member.
[2:44:55.280 --> 2:44:59.240]  I saw you give 20,000 out at one of that's just one event.
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:02.040]  I mean, we literally, how many of you did you give out over a hundred thousand?
[2:45:02.040 --> 2:45:03.280]  I told you, stop it.
[2:45:03.280 --> 2:45:06.960]  I know that's $70,000, which would have allowed you guys to make more films.
[2:45:06.960 --> 2:45:08.320]  You got to save some money to live on.
[2:45:08.320 --> 2:45:11.440]  No, I know you're already talking about trying to give this out for free.
[2:45:11.440 --> 2:45:14.080]  Burma, she won't ever be able to make another film if this happens.
[2:45:14.080 --> 2:45:15.080]  I know, I know, I know.
[2:45:15.080 --> 2:45:18.760]  I guess I got a big heart, but you know, well, it's bad business.
[2:45:18.760 --> 2:45:19.760]  I agree.
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:23.760]  You know, I'm, I am a diehard capitalist too, but I just, you know, I want me, it's not
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:26.120]  about money, but you have to have the money to fund.
[2:45:26.120 --> 2:45:27.120]  I agree.
[2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:31.320]  I absolutely, people don't understand that it takes, you know, $1,000 for a television
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:32.320]  to watch this on.
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:35.840]  It takes $4,000 for an editing machine and then you have to pay an editor that would
[2:45:35.840 --> 2:45:36.840]  normally cost $2,500.
[2:45:36.840 --> 2:45:41.440]  How about that AP footage cost $2,500 for eight minutes of AP?
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:42.440]  That's what that was.
[2:45:42.440 --> 2:45:43.440]  You got eight minutes, folks.
[2:45:43.440 --> 2:45:46.840]  I mean, literally, what is it, 480 seconds, 25 Gs.
[2:45:46.840 --> 2:45:47.840]  And that's the real deal.
[2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:49.200]  And that's what you have to go through.
[2:45:49.200 --> 2:45:52.440]  And then you're reduced to big bites and then we're not rolling in cash here.
[2:45:52.440 --> 2:45:56.560]  I'm doing this big contest in a desperate attempt when I give me a donation to try
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:45:58.640]  to expose internet censorship.
[2:45:58.640 --> 2:46:01.800]  I mean, I need real filmmakers to come in and that's the point.
[2:46:01.800 --> 2:46:03.040]  I'm about to put it in a college fund.
[2:46:03.040 --> 2:46:04.040]  I'm not going to spin.
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:05.040]  Oh, I'm spending it on that.
[2:46:05.040 --> 2:46:06.040]  Yeah.
[2:46:06.040 --> 2:46:08.240]  Because I'm not going to take a donation and spend it myself.
[2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:09.720]  It's definitely now or never.
[2:46:09.720 --> 2:46:11.640]  So you know, that's why I'm putting this film together.
[2:46:11.640 --> 2:46:15.320]  Like, like I said, you know, intelligence ties and then we get into the funding.
[2:46:15.320 --> 2:46:20.680]  You know, we show, hey, Saudi Arabia and the United States elite, such as, you know, the
[2:46:20.680 --> 2:46:24.920]  Bush family, Cheney's, Hallibur and all this stuff, and even Enron.
[2:46:24.920 --> 2:46:29.480]  I mean, we have that great blurb about Enron actually funding the Taliban and al-Qaeda prior
[2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:31.440]  to 9-11 and even after.
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:34.880]  And we show how these connections have worked for years and years and years and we really
[2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:37.040]  get into how bin Laden was CIA.
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:41.840]  And at the end, you say the U.S., Israel, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia did it.
[2:46:41.840 --> 2:46:43.520]  We basically say, yeah, those are the role players.
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:45.560]  Those are the big ones that need to be looked at.
[2:46:45.560 --> 2:46:46.800]  Obviously there might be some more intricacies.
[2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:48.480]  And there's this sophomoric behavior.
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:52.320]  It's kind of like, and I kind of blow up at Tarpaul last week because he even criticized
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:53.320]  me on air.
[2:46:53.320 --> 2:46:58.240]  I remember one show he's like, there's people saying that, that it was, it was an amount
[2:46:58.240 --> 2:46:59.240]  of tagging Tarpaul.
[2:46:59.240 --> 2:47:01.400]  It's kind of something I get sick of is what I'm saying.
[2:47:01.400 --> 2:47:06.360]  Tarpaul, I heard him on his own show on this network, you know, six months ago, eight months
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:10.960]  ago, whenever it was, we were breaking the JFK stuff with the E Howard Hunt tape where
[2:47:10.960 --> 2:47:15.000]  he says, as far as the chain of command went for him was the president, LBJ gave him the
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  order.
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:18.520]  Obviously we're not saying it didn't go above LBJ.
[2:47:18.520 --> 2:47:20.200]  That's the chain of command we can prove.
[2:47:20.200 --> 2:47:23.720]  Like in a mafia structure with a criminal investigation in the mob, we can only go as
[2:47:23.720 --> 2:47:29.320]  high as the capo or the soldier we've got for who they got orders from.
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:33.000]  And so then I hear these talk shows, oh, they're trying to say it was LBJ alone.
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  It's a diversion.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:39.960]  Or, or in this film, we're saying British intelligence, U.S., Israeli, Saudi Arabian,
[2:47:39.960 --> 2:47:41.480]  Pakistani.
[2:47:41.480 --> 2:47:44.080]  It doesn't say one group's more innocent than the other.
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:45.720]  It's like five guys robbing a bank.
[2:47:45.720 --> 2:47:46.720]  They're all five guilty.
[2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:53.120]  But again, it's a mental diversion to then say, no, it's really the, this group is doing
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:54.120]  it.
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:55.120]  It's really that group that's doing it.
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:47:56.720]  No folks, these intelligence agencies work together.
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:47:57.720]  Yeah.
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:02.320]  And in my continuity of government section, COG, that is the quote unquote shadow government,
[2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:05.680]  Alex, that does not exist in most people's minds, the bunker government.
[2:48:05.680 --> 2:48:11.280]  I show you how Cheney was in that command center prior to the Pentagon strike that we
[2:48:11.280 --> 2:48:14.680]  have Manetta saying he was there at 9.20 on several different occasions.
[2:48:14.680 --> 2:48:18.560]  And he's the one that gave that stand down order at the Pentagon.
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:22.200]  He's the guy that we can bring to trial and flesh this whole system out.
[2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:24.680]  I mean, I go a lot deeper in continuity of government folks.
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:27.360]  I show you how it was reworked into the eighties.
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:30.520]  This is the birth of the sole source contract that nobody knew about.
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:35.480]  These are the true black ops people and folks, the original head was the vice president at
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:41.200]  the time, George H. W. Bush, the same guy that happens to stay in the White House the
[2:48:41.200 --> 2:48:45.320]  night before 9 11 and then on 9 11 goes and meets with bin Laden's brother and you show
[2:48:45.320 --> 2:48:48.680]  from archival footage, congressional hearings and documents how in the mid eighties they
[2:48:48.680 --> 2:48:53.360]  created the continuity of government and it was Cheney that created it, Rex 84, all the
[2:48:53.360 --> 2:48:54.360]  same plan.
[2:48:54.360 --> 2:48:57.840]  They've been trying to bring this about ever since the Democrats are involved getting
[2:48:57.840 --> 2:49:05.120]  back to funding you Bermas that issue before we let you go and go back to calls again.
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:09.560]  You guys gave out over 100,000 DVDs for free at what 60, 70 cents a piece.
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:10.560]  Yeah.
[2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:11.560]  About 77 cents.
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:12.560]  I think something like that.
[2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:13.560]  Okay.
[2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:17.920]  Again, what if a thousand listeners get fabled enemies or truth rising and if a thousand
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:25.640]  listeners make 100 copies a piece that right there is 100,000 C said of us bankrupting
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:28.920]  ourselves because believe me, I've tempted you to spend every dime I got in the bank.
[2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:33.560]  But see, I need that for a to do the media deal to expand the fight.
[2:49:33.560 --> 2:49:34.680]  I'm trying to fight smart here.
[2:49:34.680 --> 2:49:38.680]  I need you to make the 100,000 copies of truth rising.
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:42.400]  That's a hundred of you agreeing to make a thousand copies instead of Bermas, who I
[2:49:42.400 --> 2:49:46.040]  just basically have loaned him the money to buy some what 10 year old car.
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:47.040]  Yeah.
[2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:49.560]  And I hope when you drive back to New York, it makes it on me too.
[2:49:49.560 --> 2:49:52.480]  You know, but the point is, is, and we're not whining here.
[2:49:52.480 --> 2:49:55.520]  It's just people need to see the crud hole I'm in right now.
[2:49:55.520 --> 2:49:58.480]  I mean, it's got good equipment, but the point is, and we never talk about this.
[2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:04.040]  I just am tired of this illusion that, you know, we are just capitalized like Chase Manhattan.
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:08.120]  Never not folks are bank account is you, it is you supporting us.
[2:50:08.120 --> 2:50:11.760]  So if you want to send me donations, I mean, I've come to the realization, why not have
[2:50:11.760 --> 2:50:12.760]  sponsors?
[2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:13.760]  Why not raise money?
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:14.760]  Why not fight to win?
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:16.160]  I mean, I'm put my life on the line.
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:18.920]  We can potentially get killed or imprisoned or set up a good chance of it.
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:19.920]  Why not fight all the way?
[2:50:19.920 --> 2:50:24.120]  So go to infowars.com today, get loose change, final cut from there.
[2:50:24.120 --> 2:50:26.160]  And then Bermas will actually get some of the money from that.
[2:50:26.160 --> 2:50:32.160]  I mean, you know, right there infowars.com, get loose change, final cut order truth rising
[2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:33.160]  that supports us.
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:37.720]  We need to further capitalize on spending money like it's going on a style here and
[2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:39.040]  we're about to go to the next level.
[2:50:39.040 --> 2:50:44.040]  We need your support infowars.com or 888-25-33139 phone call straight ahead.
[2:50:44.040 --> 2:50:46.040]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:50:46.040 --> 2:50:54.680]  I've come with a message of information 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:50:54.680 --> 2:50:55.680]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:50:55.680 --> 2:50:57.400]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:50:57.400 --> 2:51:00.120]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[2:51:00.120 --> 2:51:05.120]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:11.800]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:51:11.800 --> 2:51:13.840]  to grow at our own door.
[2:51:13.840 --> 2:51:19.200]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:51:19.200 --> 2:51:22.320]  An inside job?
[2:51:22.320 --> 2:51:23.320]  How dare you?
[2:51:23.320 --> 2:51:29.960]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:51:29.960 --> 2:51:31.960]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:51:31.960 --> 2:51:36.960]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the tenth
[2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:37.960]  anniversary of 9-11.

[2:53:06.720 --> 2:53:08.880]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[2:53:08.880 --> 2:53:12.480]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[2:53:12.480 --> 2:53:17.320]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists, and the whole Council
[2:53:17.320 --> 2:53:19.920]  on Foreign Relations gang head on.

[2:53:58.440 --> 2:54:04.440]  No, to Alaska, go north for Russia's on.
[2:54:04.440 --> 2:54:09.680]  Big Sam left Seattle in the year of 92.
[2:54:09.680 --> 2:54:15.520]  With George Pratt, his partner and brother Billy too.
[2:54:15.520 --> 2:54:21.520]  They crossed the Yukon River and found the Bonanza Gold.
[2:54:21.520 --> 2:54:27.040]  Below that old white mountain, just a little southeastern knoll.
[2:54:27.040 --> 2:54:32.840]  Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below.
[2:54:32.840 --> 2:54:38.520]  He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow.
[2:54:38.520 --> 2:54:44.280]  With the northern lights are running wild in the land of the midnight sun.
[2:54:44.280 --> 2:54:49.280]  Yes, Sam McCord was a mighty man in the year of 19-1.
[2:54:49.280 --> 2:54:54.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we can beat the new world order.
[2:54:54.280 --> 2:54:58.280]  We've got it in our guts, we've got it in our ancestors' strength.
[2:54:58.280 --> 2:55:03.280]  We've got to stop listening to all their flim flam, all their propaganda,
[2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:06.280]  realize there are a bunch of bankrupt criminals playing games with us,
[2:55:06.280 --> 2:55:09.280]  and just fully hate the government and expose it,
[2:55:09.280 --> 2:55:13.280]  and bring these criminals to justice. We can do it.
[2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:16.280]  We've got to have the attitude that we can win, though, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:21.280]  Jim in Texas and Jim in Lance and Ed, many others that are holding.
[2:55:21.280 --> 2:55:23.280]  Jim in Texas, go ahead.
[2:55:23.280 --> 2:55:25.280]  Alex.
[2:55:25.280 --> 2:55:26.280]  Hello, Jim.
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:29.280]  Hey, the call-in format's great. I really love it.
[2:55:29.280 --> 2:55:35.280]  I was calling in the press's report on the weather modification in China
[2:55:35.280 --> 2:55:36.280]  for the Olympics.
[2:55:36.280 --> 2:55:39.280]  But when our government does it, it doesn't exist.
[2:55:39.280 --> 2:55:41.280]  That's exactly what I was going to say.
[2:55:41.280 --> 2:55:46.280]  This is one of the top five issues for the new world order that are really important.
[2:55:46.280 --> 2:55:50.280]  There's still people denying whether modification exists.
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:54.280]  Do a search right now. China Olympics, weather modification.
[2:55:54.280 --> 2:55:59.280]  They're using heavy artillery to take clouds out of the sky.
[2:55:59.280 --> 2:56:05.280]  My comment would be, this kind of just outright debunks global warming,
[2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:08.280]  because how can you say that global warming is man-made
[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:11.280]  when they're modifying the weather?
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:17.280]  So there's no real measure of what's really happening if there's these programs going on.
[2:56:17.280 --> 2:56:19.280]  Well, they are terraforming.
[2:56:19.280 --> 2:56:21.280]  They are altering the planet's weather.
[2:56:21.280 --> 2:56:24.280]  That has come out in hundreds of declassified documents, newscasts.
[2:56:24.280 --> 2:56:25.280]  We've covered it.
[2:56:25.280 --> 2:56:29.280]  They're adding to jet fuel particulates that come out the back of the jet engine
[2:56:29.280 --> 2:56:31.280]  that are actually heating the earth.
[2:56:31.280 --> 2:56:33.280]  And they're playing all sorts of scams.
[2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:34.280]  They're playing God.
[2:56:34.280 --> 2:56:39.280]  Look, the witch doctors, 6,000, 7,000 years ago, in basic anthropology,
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:46.280]  you learned how from Mesoamerica to, you know, the first civilizations
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:53.280]  in the Tigris, Euphrates to what is ancient China, they would tell the public,
[2:56:53.280 --> 2:56:55.280]  let us sacrifice people.
[2:56:55.280 --> 2:56:56.280]  And that was a control mode.
[2:56:56.280 --> 2:56:59.280]  Will you give us your kids to burn them at the stake, you know, to barbecue them?
[2:56:59.280 --> 2:57:01.280]  That was a mind control test.
[2:57:01.280 --> 2:57:05.280]  If you get the public to give your kids up for sacrifice, then you've got control.
[2:57:05.280 --> 2:57:09.280]  And the witch doctors or the con artist government scum of the day, they would say,
[2:57:09.280 --> 2:57:13.280]  give me the biggest hut, give me the biggest temple, make me the king.
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:18.280]  A tribal leader wasn't about being able to find the best game or being the strongest
[2:57:18.280 --> 2:57:20.280]  or being the best warrior anymore.
[2:57:20.280 --> 2:57:25.280]  Around 6,000 years ago in most cultures, it became the con artist or the carpet bagger,
[2:57:25.280 --> 2:57:28.280]  the scammer, the snake oil bamboozler.
[2:57:28.280 --> 2:57:32.280]  Those that learned how to lie to people through superstition, and they would say,
[2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:38.280]  next week, if you don't bow down to Gabunga, the snake god will eat the sun.
[2:57:38.280 --> 2:57:40.280]  And after people say, oh, you're full of it.
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:44.280]  And then all of a sudden they would see the sun get gobbled because the witch doctor's family
[2:57:44.280 --> 2:57:47.280]  was passing down when that was going to happen because they happened to pay attention.
[2:57:47.280 --> 2:57:49.280]  It was the same thing now.
[2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:53.280]  You know, if you don't give up all your control your life and let us run your life,
[2:57:53.280 --> 2:57:54.280]  the earth's going to die.
[2:57:54.280 --> 2:57:57.280]  And then the people say, okay, so it's just basic witch doctor psychology.
[2:57:57.280 --> 2:58:03.280]  I love the way that you connect those dots, Alex, because most people haven't done things
[2:58:03.280 --> 2:58:09.280]  like go join a cult in the New Age, get into the Kundalini energy awareness,
[2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:14.280]  only to go way down that porthole to find out it's all being ran by the United Nations,
[2:58:14.280 --> 2:58:16.280]  and it all goes back to witch doctory.
[2:58:16.280 --> 2:58:26.280]  Yep, all official United Nations biological diversity assessments says they are going to kill us in Mass Human Sacrifices.

[3:00:11.280 --> 3:00:12.280]  I'm taking even more.
[3:00:12.280 --> 3:00:16.280]  I'm going crazy to shower 1-800-259-9231.
[3:00:16.280 --> 3:00:18.280]  Let's take four calls right now.
[3:00:18.280 --> 3:00:22.280]  Jim in Virginia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:00:22.280 --> 3:00:23.280]  Yes, sir.
[3:00:23.280 --> 3:00:24.280]  Hey, how you doing, sir?
[3:00:24.280 --> 3:00:25.280]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:28.280]  I had a chance to meet you at the Bilderberger in Chantilly.
[3:00:28.280 --> 3:00:29.280]  Hey, good to meet you there, my friend.
[3:00:29.280 --> 3:00:30.280]  That was it.
[3:00:30.280 --> 3:00:32.280]  I think it was a hell of a success.
[3:00:32.280 --> 3:00:37.280]  I wanted to make a point to you regarding, well, you're talking to Ted Nugent the other day.
[3:00:37.280 --> 3:00:42.280]  I feel like Ted is the type of individual that really has a lot of influence.
[3:00:42.280 --> 3:00:49.280]  I was wondering if you thought it would be a worthwhile idea to try to identify other people of his caliber,
[3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:57.280]  people with some entertainment or celebrity status that you might bring on to try to convince them of...
[3:00:57.280 --> 3:00:59.280]  Because it seemed to me he was not...
[3:00:59.280 --> 3:01:02.280]  I don't know if his position on 9-11, where he's at with it.
[3:01:02.280 --> 3:01:03.280]  Do you have any idea?
[3:01:03.280 --> 3:01:07.280]  He, in the past, he thought it was a real attack, but he's been starting to wake up.
[3:01:07.280 --> 3:01:12.280]  Look, what happens is these people fall in our laps.
[3:01:12.280 --> 3:01:18.280]  Ted Nugent's one of the only big guests that didn't seek us out.
[3:01:18.280 --> 3:01:24.280]  A lot of times, and it's great, with a lot of these other big celebrities that you end up seeing on the show,
[3:01:24.280 --> 3:01:31.280]  or hearing on the show, it's because we are the biggest game in town in the fight against the New World Order,
[3:01:31.280 --> 3:01:35.280]  which is scary because we're not that big, but they reach out to us.
[3:01:35.280 --> 3:01:37.280]  Who knows what other celebrities are listening?
[3:01:37.280 --> 3:01:40.280]  I mean, who knows who else is tuning in?
[3:01:40.280 --> 3:01:48.280]  So, you know, we do contact big guests when they have a new book out.
[3:01:48.280 --> 3:01:50.280]  That's how we get them on.
[3:01:50.280 --> 3:01:54.280]  The type of individual I believe he's completely honest.
[3:01:54.280 --> 3:01:57.280]  I believe he could be reasoned with.
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:02.280]  And, you know, I was thinking maybe we could come up with a list of other people of that type that would then have a...
[3:02:02.280 --> 3:02:06.280]  Well, you know, I try my best to just spew the info out into the ether,
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:08.280]  and then it's up to you guys to carry the ball.
[3:02:08.280 --> 3:02:10.280]  If you carry the ball, more will come to us.
[3:02:10.280 --> 3:02:14.280]  You build it, they will come, and you, my friend, look in the mirror,
[3:02:14.280 --> 3:02:21.280]  and you're obviously here, you know, with us, Jim, but it is you who will carry that ball.
[3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:23.280]  Yeah, I'd actually made contact with him.
[3:02:23.280 --> 3:02:27.280]  I believe I probably talked to his son, and I was trying to see if he'd be willing to have a conversation.
[3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:30.280]  He suggested that he sure he could send him an email.
[3:02:30.280 --> 3:02:35.280]  Yeah, well, sometimes, you know, bugging the celebrities yourselves will run him off.
[3:02:35.280 --> 3:02:39.280]  I've sent Ted six, seven years ago some videos.
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:43.280]  I sent him in-game last week.
[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:46.280]  He gave me his home address, and so I'm trying my best.
[3:02:46.280 --> 3:02:48.280]  See, you bring up, reaching out to him.
[3:02:48.280 --> 3:02:50.280]  I did reach out to Ted Nugent.
[3:02:50.280 --> 3:02:51.280]  I appreciate your call.
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:02:52.280]  Let's go to Ed in New York.
[3:02:52.280 --> 3:02:54.280]  Ed, you're on the air.
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:56.280]  Come ahead, Ed.
[3:02:56.280 --> 3:02:58.280]  Yes, sir.
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:02:59.280]  Okay.
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:01.280]  I work as a subway conductor here in New York,
[3:03:01.280 --> 3:03:04.280]  and I've given out so far over a thousand copies of your various videos.
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:06.280]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[3:03:06.280 --> 3:03:08.280]  And I really thank you for your work.
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:10.280]  I've got a couple of just, if I love your bumper music.
[3:03:10.280 --> 3:03:13.280]  Have you ever heard the song, The Monster, by Steppenwolf?
[3:03:13.280 --> 3:03:15.280]  I've actually sent that song.
[3:03:15.280 --> 3:03:16.280]  Here's what happens.
[3:03:16.280 --> 3:03:23.280]  They got John Harmon answering phones, doing traffic, running my show, and running our phones.
[3:03:23.280 --> 3:03:25.280]  The job of about four people, it's insane.
[3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:27.280]  They need to hire somebody to help him.
[3:03:27.280 --> 3:03:29.280]  In the past, they didn't have the capital.
[3:03:29.280 --> 3:03:30.280]  They may have that now.
[3:03:30.280 --> 3:03:31.280]  This show's big enough.
[3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:33.280]  I want somebody to help John right now.
[3:03:33.280 --> 3:03:37.280]  And over the years, I've sent John masses of news, masses of music.
[3:03:37.280 --> 3:03:39.280]  He's tried to get a lot of it on.
[3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:41.280]  In the past, there were board ops who just told me,
[3:03:41.280 --> 3:03:43.280]  I'm not putting your music on.
[3:03:43.280 --> 3:03:45.280]  And then they didn't know I didn't love them because they were so lazy.
[3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:47.280]  John's just a miracle.
[3:03:47.280 --> 3:03:49.280]  It is in rotation.
[3:03:49.280 --> 3:03:51.280]  Okay, I did say he didn't put it in.
[3:03:51.280 --> 3:03:54.280]  But let me tell you, with something with the computer program in there,
[3:03:54.280 --> 3:03:58.280]  there's hundreds of songs you never hear because it keeps restarting at different points
[3:03:58.280 --> 3:04:00.280]  instead of going through the catalog.
[3:04:00.280 --> 3:04:03.280]  And so now you bring up one of my pet peeves.
[3:04:03.280 --> 3:04:06.280]  And so we're trying to get the new music in there.
[3:04:06.280 --> 3:04:07.280]  Go ahead.
[3:04:07.280 --> 3:04:10.280]  Okay, I read all of David Ike's books.
[3:04:10.280 --> 3:04:12.280]  And one of his books, he has a quote by Nietzsche.
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:16.280]  If you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gaze is also into you.
[3:04:16.280 --> 3:04:17.280]  Yes.
[3:04:17.280 --> 3:04:18.280]  You take a vacation.
[3:04:18.280 --> 3:04:21.280]  As much as I love you when I love your show,
[3:04:21.280 --> 3:04:24.280]  I think you might be looking too much into the abyss.
[3:04:24.280 --> 3:04:25.280]  Oh, I agree.
[3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:29.280]  I'm looking into the crystal ball a bit too much into Sauron's eye.
[3:04:29.280 --> 3:04:30.280]  Absolutely, brother.
[3:04:30.280 --> 3:04:33.280]  I have stared into the abyss like you can't imagine.
[3:04:33.280 --> 3:04:36.280]  I have stared deeply into the abyss and I can't take a vacation and get away from it.
[3:04:36.280 --> 3:04:39.280]  I am forever caught in its gaze.
[3:04:39.280 --> 3:04:42.280]  But I see in pure love.
[3:04:42.280 --> 3:04:44.280]  Straight back into it, it doesn't like it.
[3:04:44.280 --> 3:04:47.280]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth,
[3:04:47.280 --> 3:04:51.280]  no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder,
[3:04:51.280 --> 3:04:53.280]  seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[3:05:48.280 --> 3:05:53.280]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[3:06:43.280 --> 3:06:51.280]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[3:06:51.280 --> 3:06:53.280]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:06:53.280 --> 3:07:00.280]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:07:00.280 --> 3:07:09.280]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:07:09.280 --> 3:07:16.280]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:07:16.280 --> 3:07:19.280]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[3:07:19.280 --> 3:07:25.280]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[3:07:37.280 --> 3:07:43.280]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:08:09.280 --> 3:08:17.280]  My forever condense gaze, as long as I'm in this movement, as long as I'm fighting the New World Order, as long as I'm facing true reality,
[3:08:17.280 --> 3:08:19.280]  that's what drives me crazy.
[3:08:19.280 --> 3:08:21.280]  I mean, I know they're committing all these crimes.
[3:08:21.280 --> 3:08:22.280]  I know it's getting worse.
[3:08:22.280 --> 3:08:24.280]  Their master plan is stated.
[3:08:24.280 --> 3:08:32.280]  I mean, years ago before, I'd really deeply, totally studied a lot more and now verified so much of what I'd already estimated.
[3:08:32.280 --> 3:08:35.280]  It's always what I thought and works.
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:39.280]  And it is, I fully understand the New World Order's mind.
[3:08:39.280 --> 3:08:40.280]  It's spirit.
[3:08:40.280 --> 3:08:42.280]  I know what it is.
[3:08:42.280 --> 3:08:49.280]  And it sounds like a rage a lot of times, like I'm in a rage, but it's more than that.
[3:08:49.280 --> 3:08:50.280]  It's just frustration.
[3:08:50.280 --> 3:08:51.280]  It's energy.
[3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:54.280]  It's crying out.
[3:08:54.280 --> 3:09:04.280]  It's howling back at the New World Order because I just love life and goodness and honor and decency and camaraderie and brotherhood.
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:06.280]  And creativity.
[3:09:06.280 --> 3:09:09.280]  And I just honor it and love it and defend it.
[3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:11.280]  And I love what is good.
[3:09:11.280 --> 3:09:13.280]  I just love what is good.
[3:09:13.280 --> 3:09:15.280]  I love goodness.
[3:09:15.280 --> 3:09:17.280]  I love wholesomeness.
[3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:20.280]  I love seeing people do well and beauty.
[3:09:20.280 --> 3:09:24.280]  And I never understood growing up what envy and jealousy was.
[3:09:24.280 --> 3:09:25.280]  I don't have it.
[3:09:25.280 --> 3:09:27.280]  I have competitiveness.
[3:09:27.280 --> 3:09:29.280]  But I don't really have ego.
[3:09:29.280 --> 3:09:31.280]  I don't know how to explain it.
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:33.280]  I mean, I'm different than a lot of people are like me.
[3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:34.280]  I don't see.
[3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:45.280]  And the more I study the older ages and the age of chivalry and our founding fathers, people like that, they were, they were more into what I'm into, you know, deeper than I am because of being around each other.
[3:09:45.280 --> 3:09:56.280]  They were into being intelligent and informed and speaking five, six, seven languages and understanding history and being able to debate and having courage and will and strength and honor.
[3:09:56.280 --> 3:09:58.280]  I mean, they weren't acting tough.
[3:09:58.280 --> 3:10:02.280]  You know, I love that saying in full mental jacket, the phony tough and the crazy brave.
[3:10:02.280 --> 3:10:04.280]  They are the crazy brave.
[3:10:04.280 --> 3:10:09.280]  And I really have to control myself because I have too much courage, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:10:09.280 --> 3:10:11.280]  I have to temper and it's not even courage.
[3:10:11.280 --> 3:10:13.280]  It's who I am.
[3:10:13.280 --> 3:10:14.280]  It's what I am.
[3:10:14.280 --> 3:10:20.280]  I burn Leviticus or is it Ezekiel talks about, you know, one of the people speaking out against evil.
[3:10:20.280 --> 3:10:21.280]  It burns.
[3:10:21.280 --> 3:10:22.280]  He said, Lord, they're going to kill me.
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:23.280]  They're coming after me.
[3:10:23.280 --> 3:10:25.280]  They told me I got to shut up, but I can't.
[3:10:25.280 --> 3:10:26.280]  It burns.
[3:10:26.280 --> 3:10:28.280]  It burns.
[3:10:28.280 --> 3:10:37.280]  I know that they sent out millions and millions of dosages.
[3:10:37.280 --> 3:10:45.280]  A factor rate that gave every single person that got it HIV and hepatitis and a bunch of other blood-borne diseases.
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:50.280]  And I know because it's admitted and released in public that they knew it the whole time and did it on purpose.
[3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:55.280]  I burned to warn you this government, this elite is evil.
[3:10:55.280 --> 3:11:00.280]  And I get angry when people sit there and tell me I'm making something up or Alex is a fear monger.
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:01.280]  He exaggerates.
[3:11:01.280 --> 3:11:02.280]  How do you exaggerate?
[3:11:02.280 --> 3:11:04.280]  They are murdering people.
[3:11:04.280 --> 3:11:06.280]  That's only one pharmaceutical company.
[3:11:06.280 --> 3:11:08.280]  How in the world do you trust anything they do?
[3:11:08.280 --> 3:11:18.280]  Any of these companies, any of these people, government, all the lies, the corruption, just all of it being lied to millions of times.
[3:11:18.280 --> 3:11:21.280]  And then I get angry because I don't want to be killed.
[3:11:21.280 --> 3:11:22.280]  I don't want to be in prison.
[3:11:22.280 --> 3:11:23.280]  I don't want to be set up.
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:26.280]  I don't want to have to be on the road I'm on.
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:28.280]  And I put it all in God's hands.
[3:11:28.280 --> 3:11:30.280]  God, please let me live to be 90 years old.
[3:11:30.280 --> 3:11:31.280]  I want to see my grandchildren.
[3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:32.280]  I want to grow old.
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:35.280]  But I don't sit there and try to tell God what to do.
[3:11:35.280 --> 3:11:43.280]  I say, whatever your will is, the only thing I ever ask God to do is that I be struck down or destroyed before anybody in my family is.
[3:11:43.280 --> 3:11:45.280]  That's the only thing I ask.
[3:11:45.280 --> 3:11:46.280]  I'm not saying I deserve it.
[3:11:46.280 --> 3:11:48.280]  I'm not saying God owes it to me.
[3:11:48.280 --> 3:11:55.280]  My soul cries out that you let them tear me apart and torture me for a hundred years before you let anything happen to my family.
[3:11:55.280 --> 3:11:58.280]  Please God, please.
[3:11:58.280 --> 3:12:02.280]  Because that's something I can't bear, but that's also something I can't stop.
[3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:04.280]  I can't stop what's going on in this world.
[3:12:04.280 --> 3:12:07.280]  I can't control it all.

[3:12:36.280 --> 3:12:43.120]  with them and it makes my soul burn with pain. An absolute unquenchable desire to bring
[3:12:43.120 --> 3:12:48.480]  them to justice. An unquenchable desire to have brethren with the police and brethren
[3:12:48.480 --> 3:12:53.400]  with people in government and to see goodness and honesty and righteousness rise. Does that
[3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:58.680]  mean I'm righteous? Does it mean I'm perfect? No! But it means my spirit and what I long
[3:12:58.680 --> 3:13:04.480]  for. I know what the good is and I want the good and I look at myself and it's dirty rags
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:10.480]  and I cry out in thanks to God for the creation we live in and the beauty and the majesty
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:16.760]  of it all. With evil over running it all, having its way, destroying God's creations
[3:13:16.760 --> 3:13:25.400]  it outrageous me. And it outrageous me to know. But so many people who've been fallen
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:31.320]  to evil and beguiled and seduced by wickedness who think they're empowered and think that
[3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:35.320]  they have power and who search for power and who think that it's fun to carry out these
[3:13:35.320 --> 3:13:41.160]  evils or to not care about others, to know that they have lost everything, their soul.
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:46.840]  What is it for a man to gain the whole world but lose his eternal soul? Fear not he that
[3:13:46.840 --> 3:13:58.600]  can kill the body but he that can kill the spirit. And yes it is dangerous staring into
[3:13:58.600 --> 3:14:07.760]  the abyss. God. I know a lot of people can't do it because when you stare into that you
[3:14:07.760 --> 3:14:13.480]  see it all. The snuff films with toddlers, just all of it that's come out in the news
[3:14:13.480 --> 3:14:17.800]  you start facing that and thinking about that and the stuff they do and these European
[3:14:17.800 --> 3:14:21.440]  elites when they go and rape these kids and then chain them up and starve them to death
[3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:29.160]  and the dungeons and the crap. I mean I just it's unbelievable. I'm not gonna rant anymore
[3:14:29.160 --> 3:14:39.280]  I'm just gonna take your calls. I am a man and just like a dog why do we have dogs in
[3:14:39.280 --> 3:14:43.680]  all our houses? Because we're very similar to these sweet but also aggressive creatures
[3:14:43.680 --> 3:14:49.200]  that are tribal that are pack animals who love each other and who are strong and brave
[3:14:49.200 --> 3:14:53.480]  a little dog or take on a grizzly bear and you know it sees an enemy in your backyard
[3:14:53.480 --> 3:15:00.120]  it barks, it snarls, it wants to protect its cave, wants to protect its den and that's
[3:15:00.120 --> 3:15:10.640]  all I am. I'm just a man. I'm just a primitive man. I come from very aggressive you know
[3:15:10.640 --> 3:15:15.200]  stock like most people in this country do but particularly in Texas and other frontier
[3:15:15.200 --> 3:15:18.320]  settlements where it was the people of the frontier of the frontier of the frontier of
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:23.360]  the frontier is a filter of the meanest the most aggressive you know that made it into
[3:15:23.360 --> 3:15:30.480]  these areas. All the Indian fighting of ancestors I had and then the Indians you know that I
[3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:36.760]  got that bloodline all of us have this incredible past and all I am is this aggressive somewhat
[3:15:36.760 --> 3:15:43.080]  intelligent good old boy and I found out there's a pack of sicko scientist freaks running everything
[3:15:43.080 --> 3:15:48.840]  killing a bunch of people murdering people with cancer and then it makes me mad and I
[3:15:48.840 --> 3:15:53.680]  know it's true it's all documented it freaks me out that it's going on and on and getting
[3:15:53.680 --> 3:16:00.400]  worse and worse and worse and worse and I just want it to stop. I just want it to stop.
[3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:05.040]  I want you men out there to have enough courage to check out what I've said and find out it's
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:09.200]  true instead of having your manhood shunted off into directions that don't matter serving
[3:16:09.200 --> 3:16:18.680]  this evil system. Doing bad things it tears me up seeing you be destroyed it tears me
[3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:24.000]  up seeing you on the wrong team. I want you to come in and join us and come in for the
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:29.600]  big win with the living God and I don't mean the fake God these fake preachers push I mean
[3:16:29.600 --> 3:16:38.520]  the real the real creator the energy force that fills the universe full of life. I gotta
[3:16:38.520 --> 3:16:43.760]  stop preaching who's up first here is it and or Judith Judith and British Columbia you're
[3:16:43.760 --> 3:16:56.760]  on the air. Oh I hear your pain. Listen brother your guy who donated a bunch of money. You
[3:16:56.760 --> 3:17:09.320]  mentioned that he did it to bring out internet sorry hang on. No no no I mean I got a moderate
[3:17:09.320 --> 3:17:13.400]  sized donation we get a few a year and the guy said spend it however you want I'm spending
[3:17:13.400 --> 3:17:21.400]  it to expose government censorship of internet. Oh okay okay well my website is being censored
[3:17:21.400 --> 3:17:35.080]  right now. It's adentalbraces.ca for anybody who wants dental braces. The whole information
[3:17:35.080 --> 3:17:43.400]  is at the website it's adentalbraces.ca they're very affordable they're everything. And how
[3:17:43.400 --> 3:17:52.680]  is your website being censored? Well on the iMac Safari and Firefox are not showing the
[3:17:52.680 --> 3:17:56.440]  graphics nor are they... Well that just means that you man I appreciate your call that means
[3:17:56.440 --> 3:18:01.280]  you got I gotta let you go. Man we're sitting here with cancer viruses in the vaccines you're
[3:18:01.280 --> 3:18:06.240]  talking about browsers you don't have your website set up right. If it's being filtered
[3:18:06.240 --> 3:18:11.360]  and blocked completely and you can't get to it and ISPs are blocking you then that's
[3:18:11.360 --> 3:18:18.240]  censorship but if we have this all the time if we add something new to one of our websites
[3:18:18.240 --> 3:18:22.760]  that on different browsers it can't be seen. So I just wanted to tell you that it's not
[3:18:22.760 --> 3:18:27.800]  censorship of your website. Now you got your plug in okay I hope you sell some dental bracelets
[3:18:27.800 --> 3:18:31.360]  and I know you'll hate me forever now because I was just rude to you but I just frankly
[3:18:31.360 --> 3:18:38.440]  I go to your phone calls and it's about all of this craziness and I just happen to know
[3:18:38.440 --> 3:18:44.400]  about computers and how they work and I just wanted to give you a real solution for the
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:49.520]  type of computer program you're using for your website you need to make sure it's compatible
[3:18:49.520 --> 3:18:57.640]  with those browsers and with the most updated version of browsers. Okay? Okay I just can't
[3:18:57.640 --> 3:19:04.280]  talk about it anymore I just know that I'm right about that that is not web censorship.
[3:19:04.280 --> 3:19:11.320]  Oh god. I've got a little too fired up today here ladies and gentlemen. Judith I'm sure
[3:19:11.320 --> 3:19:15.680]  you're a nice lady don't hate me I'll let you plug your website twice. Mike in Florida

[3:20:49.400 --> 3:20:53.360]  dollar has been evaluating. What people don't know however is how this directly affects
[3:20:53.360 --> 3:20:57.720]  your personal finances. Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[3:20:57.720 --> 3:21:01.280]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver. They have both maintained their purchasing
[3:21:01.280 --> 3:21:06.640]  power for 6000 years. If you had had one hundred thousand dollars in cash and one hundred thousand
[3:21:06.640 --> 3:21:12.320]  dollars in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now your cash would actually
[3:21:12.320 --> 3:21:16.440]  have the buying power of only four thousand eight hundred dollars. But your gold and silver
[3:21:16.440 --> 3:21:20.200]  would have the buying power of three million dollars. The answer to protecting your assets
[3:21:20.200 --> 3:21:28.920]  is simple. Call me John ballman today at one eight hundred six eight six two two three seven extension one six nine. Get all your questions

[3:24:00.240 --> 3:24:11.520]  stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown. I live back in the woods you see. I live back in the
[3:24:11.520 --> 3:24:25.520]  woods you see. A woman and the kids and the dogs and me. I got a shotgun a rifle and a four wheel drive and a country boy can
[3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:36.160]  survive. You can't starve them out you can't make them run because these old boys were raised on shotguns. I can fly
[3:24:36.160 --> 3:24:51.160]  a field all day long. I can catch catfish from dust till dawn. Make our own whiskey and our own smoke too. Ain't too many things
[3:24:51.160 --> 3:24:56.560]  these old boys can't do. That's why the new order wants to end family farms and ranches and they're doing it with the animal
[3:24:56.560 --> 3:25:20.560]  ID and the premises ID. They're going to turn the environmental cops loose on you. It's already happening. They're coming for you. You hear that? You know it. You can't make us run.
[3:25:20.560 --> 3:25:34.560]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen glad you joined us today. We came from the West Virginia coal mines and the rocky mountains and the
[3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:55.560]  western skies. Mike in Florida you're on the air. Alex I want to talk about the possibility here of fundraising because what you're
[3:25:55.560 --> 3:26:02.560]  talking about today and basically every day is so real that you're not freaking out too much and you're not going over the edge when
[3:26:02.560 --> 3:26:10.560]  you start yelling because this stuff is real. This is what is going on. Now I think the Alex Jones companies whenever there's a way to give
[3:26:10.560 --> 3:26:18.560]  more capital in your direction, I as one of your long time listeners, I really want to contribute and I can pass out DVDs and whatnot.
[3:26:18.560 --> 3:26:29.560]  But if I've got a story of your guy Bermas passing out 100,000 DVDs, I think your listeners would also do well if we had on your main
[3:26:29.560 --> 3:26:38.560]  side, maybe a big link somewhere with an icon on it. For truth brigades. Well for truth, I like it even better. People just doing it on their own.
[3:26:38.560 --> 3:26:46.560]  That's the unstoppable paradigm. Really nothing gets wasted. But yes, we need more capital. We say buy the books, buy the videos, support the sponsors.
[3:26:46.560 --> 3:26:54.560]  I want to be able to, on top of buying a book, on top of buying a video, I really would like to make a recommendation if maybe you can get with your
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:27:03.560]  master to put on that website to set up a way where I can just click on a link and I can send money to you because there's so many of us out there
[3:27:03.560 --> 3:27:12.560]  and we're donating to our college university football programs and our business school programs. We're donating to all these causes that are really not
[3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:22.560]  helping out in a larger sense. Instead, I'd like to just be able to periodically, every now and then, go on infowars.com, click on a link and send money
[3:27:22.560 --> 3:27:31.560]  to the people that know how to deploy that capital correctly. I really want to weigh a man to support you more than I am than just passing out DVDs.
[3:27:31.560 --> 3:27:39.560]  I still want to do that, but I really, really want to make a serious recommendation. If maybe you could consider doing that, because I think you have a
[3:27:39.560 --> 3:27:53.560]  vision of listeners that on top of passing out DVDs and talking to their friends would really be very open-minded to donating money periodically, just as the course of the year goes on, to help you guys have more capital.
[3:27:53.560 --> 3:28:03.560]  Well, as the economy implodes, we may be forced to do that because even though the listenership explodes, sales are not. In fact, they're going down and that's happening with everybody.
[3:28:03.560 --> 3:28:13.560]  We did the money bomb and the problem is I'm trying to be a good steward. I'm going to spend and have been spending every bit of that on a new office, on doing more radio, a TV thing.
[3:28:13.560 --> 3:28:26.560]  It's incredible amounts of work. If I raise more money, I don't know really, I guess I could make the websites better, have more material. There are things I can do.
[3:28:26.560 --> 3:28:39.560]  You can never be overcapable and I would really, because I understand, and here's the thing, you've gotten the point across over the years to your listeners and we all buy in that you're running an honest business and you're taking the money that you do have and you're
[3:28:39.560 --> 3:28:54.560]  redeploying that into the growth of the organization. If Alex Jones comes and says, hey, look, I need some money and I know that's something you really try not to do, whether you say it or not, a lot of us I really think are kind of sitting out there silently
[3:28:54.560 --> 3:29:09.560]  and wanting to contribute more money more often because, look, the new order has all the money in the world. They just print it. So let me give you some of their Federal Reserve notes and you can go out there and have more capital to deploy to fight this battle,
[3:29:09.560 --> 3:29:17.560]  because you know how to get the point across to millions of people and if we can do more on our part, go on one of your websites.
[3:29:17.560 --> 3:29:21.560]  Okay, hey, I love you to death. I'll add a PayPal link today. How's that sound?
[3:29:21.560 --> 3:29:34.560]  Thank you, perfect. Alright, thank you so much, sir. And I pledge that every bit that gets done at it will be spent 100% fighting the new world order.
[3:29:34.560 --> 3:29:44.560]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[3:30:52.560 --> 3:30:55.560]  You like being a puppet, sir? You like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[3:30:55.560 --> 3:31:02.560]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAFR.
[3:31:02.560 --> 3:31:04.560]  Can we sit down and shuttle?
[3:31:04.560 --> 3:31:11.560]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:31:11.560 --> 3:31:17.560]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:31:17.560 --> 3:31:22.560]  Inside job? How dare you?
[3:31:22.560 --> 3:31:27.560]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:31:27.560 --> 3:31:30.560]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:31:30.560 --> 3:31:35.560]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.

[3:33:11.560 --> 3:33:19.560]  Don't forget we have the video contest to make a video exposing internet censorship by governments and corporations.
[3:33:19.560 --> 3:33:22.560]  We have all the articles there with all the proof.
[3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:31.560]  Whatever gets the most hits by Sunday night, we got an email up there for you to submit your entries.
[3:33:31.560 --> 3:33:35.560]  We'll be posting them by tomorrow as they come in on the website.
[3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:39.560]  That's a $2,000 prize for the best one on that.
[3:33:39.560 --> 3:33:48.560]  Another little prize, $1,000 for the best fan-made trailer for Truth Rising from the video that's on the web.
[3:33:48.560 --> 3:33:51.560]  I mean, that's two prizes right there.
[3:33:51.560 --> 3:33:56.560]  And then on the 19th, we're going to have a $5,000 prize for the best video about internet censorship.
[3:33:56.560 --> 3:33:59.560]  And it needs to have prismplanet.com and infowars.com.
[3:33:59.560 --> 3:34:01.560]  Incorporate it into it.
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:05.560]  Pay attention to the rules. They're easy. It's up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[3:34:05.560 --> 3:34:06.560]  Take advantage of it.
[3:34:06.560 --> 3:34:09.560]  And all of us win because all the videos will be seen by people.
[3:34:09.560 --> 3:34:11.560]  There's some other contest up there, too.
[3:34:11.560 --> 3:34:19.560]  Because then the videos will get seen where people will be educated about what's happening with internet censorship that is closing in, shutting down the web as we know it.
[3:34:19.560 --> 3:34:22.560]  I want to just take a ton of calls into the end of the show.
[3:34:22.560 --> 3:34:24.560]  I'm going to move as fast as I can here.
[3:34:24.560 --> 3:34:32.560]  1-800-2599-231 is the toll-free number to join us. 800-2599-231, James Helen, Mike, James, Mike, and others.
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:34.560]  James and Texas, you're on the air.
[3:34:34.560 --> 3:34:38.560]  Alex, I just want to thank you so much.
[3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:44.560]  Nine years ago, I moved to Texas and discovered your show by accident on public access.
[3:34:44.560 --> 3:34:47.560]  I just wanted to ask you a question.
[3:34:47.560 --> 3:34:53.560]  As I researched a lot of things you talked about, I keep coming back to one of the big paradoxes.
[3:34:53.560 --> 3:34:59.560]  There are so many shades of versions of the truth out there.
[3:34:59.560 --> 3:35:05.560]  It's difficult to know, depending on the source, how much of what they have to say to believe.
[3:35:05.560 --> 3:35:13.560]  For example, you've done a wonderful job of putting out what you know and what you researched.
[3:35:13.560 --> 3:35:17.560]  And then you have someone like Alan Waddon who's done a wonderful job of putting out what he knows.
[3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:26.560]  You two have a basic disagreement in that you're a Christian and he believes that Christianity is just another fable religion.
[3:35:26.560 --> 3:35:27.560]  And I'm wondering...
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:33.560]  Well, if you really look at what he has to say, he believes the modern religious way it's expressed, here's the deal.
[3:35:33.560 --> 3:35:39.560]  I have to understand that everybody in this movement, I'm not going to agree with them all.
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:46.560]  But 98% of what Alan says, and then we just have differences of opinion on things that can't be proven one way or the other.
[3:35:46.560 --> 3:35:49.560]  I mean, he's got all the documents about how they put cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:53.560]  He covers the same systems of brainwashing that we expose.
[3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:55.560]  I see him as accurate.
[3:35:55.560 --> 3:36:00.560]  I agree with people like Webster Tarpley on like 95% of stuff and I hopefully disagree with them on other things.
[3:36:00.560 --> 3:36:05.560]  You know, when I bring something out, that's why this is overall not a religious show or spiritual show.
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:09.560]  It's about the information, though I make no secret of what I believe.
[3:36:09.560 --> 3:36:17.560]  You know, I tell you, Bayer knowingly puts HIV in this drug and it's killed all these people.
[3:36:17.560 --> 3:36:20.560]  And then you can go check that for yourself.
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:26.560]  Or I say Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97 in the April issue of the Army Times, but it was also in a press conference.
[3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:28.560]  Army's own website, you can go read it.
[3:36:28.560 --> 3:36:31.560]  I said they have earthquake weapons and weather weapons.
[3:36:31.560 --> 3:36:34.560]  And so I read the quote and I said, how about I pull that up for you today?
[3:36:34.560 --> 3:36:36.560]  And I read it and gave you a source.
[3:36:36.560 --> 3:36:41.560]  So there are different, you know, slight differences in how things are interpreted,
[3:36:41.560 --> 3:36:47.560]  but we know we have a global tyrannical government from their own source documents
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:36:51.560]  that is carrying out dehumanization, dumbing down poisoning of the masses.
[3:36:51.560 --> 3:36:57.560]  And we can disagree on just a few of the issues, but we don't disagree on the wider issues.
[3:36:57.560 --> 3:37:04.560]  So instead of getting caught up in the minutia, this also happens in our movement where people argue all day about
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:06.560]  exactly who's at the top of the pyramid.
[3:37:06.560 --> 3:37:09.560]  And then a half of our work is on arguing with each other.
[3:37:09.560 --> 3:37:13.560]  But that's competitiveness and people trying to stay there right or they're the top dog.
[3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:15.560]  Notice, I don't really do that a lot.
[3:37:15.560 --> 3:37:20.560]  I just have everybody on, unless they're slander mere stalkers and then they're banned from the show.
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:25.560]  And I just have everybody, a platform for everybody to grow and educate and learn more.
[3:37:25.560 --> 3:37:26.560]  And I'm learning more every day.
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:27.560]  You see what I'm saying?
[3:37:27.560 --> 3:37:34.560]  Yes, no, I agree with you 100% as far as letting the truth come out because the truth will out.
[3:37:34.560 --> 3:37:41.560]  I guess the hard part for people who don't have a lot of time to dedicate to doing the research.
[3:37:41.560 --> 3:37:42.560]  Oh, you better.
[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:49.560]  No, and I have, and I appreciate it, and I use your information as a source for a lot of things that I've done on my own.
[3:37:49.560 --> 3:37:54.560]  I guess the problem is that you hear someone that has a lot of good things to say,
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:57.560]  and then all of a sudden they'll come out and they'll say something like,
[3:37:57.560 --> 3:37:59.560]  no planes actually hit the towers or something like that.
[3:37:59.560 --> 3:38:04.560]  And then it starts questioning a lot of the other things that you've heard from that same source.
[3:38:04.560 --> 3:38:09.560]  And I know that you've brought that up on the show before where someone else has a lot of things to say,
[3:38:09.560 --> 3:38:11.560]  but this area you disagree with them in.
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:13.560]  Well, here's the deal and I appreciate your call.
[3:38:13.560 --> 3:38:19.560]  We can't see do this because then even countering all that stuff only adds to the tar baby.
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:25.560]  We know sodium fluoride from thousands of studies, you can find them right now, studies on adverse effects of fluoride,
[3:38:25.560 --> 3:38:32.560]  Google that, universities, governments going back 80 years plus to modern day.
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:35.560]  There's something you can do exposing and fighting right now,
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:42.560]  or the borders are wide open and paramilitary Mexican troops are killing citizens and police and FBI and it's being covered up.
[3:38:42.560 --> 3:38:47.560]  You expose that, or we don't want to attack Iran, they're lying about Iran having nukes,
[3:38:47.560 --> 3:38:57.560]  here's the evidence and you know that instead of, you know, just all day.
[3:38:57.560 --> 3:39:03.560]  I mean, obviously people saying no planes at the towers that was set out by the feds and by some of their operatives to try to
[3:39:03.560 --> 3:39:06.560]  split the 911 truth movement, make us look stupid.
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:11.560]  I mean, even if you believe that, that's not the best evidence to bring out to people, which is pure bull.
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:15.560]  And then the people that are involved in that movement will viciously threaten you, lie about you,
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:19.560]  try every dirty trick in the book, so know them by their throats, very bad people.
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:23.560]  And so just have the basic discernment enough to move on to that and not give it attention,
[3:39:23.560 --> 3:39:27.560]  and have some discernment to cover real issues.
[3:39:27.560 --> 3:39:33.560]  And if you can't prove an issue one way or the other, like space aliens.
[3:39:33.560 --> 3:39:37.560]  I don't know if they're real or not, I don't cover it.
[3:39:37.560 --> 3:39:51.560]  You know, everybody's saying Alex, Larry King live, CNN, Fox News, AP, Reuters, Times of London.
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:57.560]  They've all got these astronauts coming out and saying they met with aliens and aliens are real and I just don't go there.
[3:39:57.560 --> 3:39:59.560]  People say, but now it's coming out.
[3:39:59.560 --> 3:40:01.560]  Well, that's the government, the media.
[3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:06.560]  I believe part of a larger disinfo program with all these movies and culture to try to discredit, you know,
[3:40:06.560 --> 3:40:11.560]  the existing order of a mindset of things and to bring the quote world together.
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:14.560]  We have some government documents on that, but it may be true.
[3:40:14.560 --> 3:40:19.560]  I don't know because it's a tar baby and I can't prove it one way or another.
[3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:21.560]  Then I stick to what I can prove.
[3:40:21.560 --> 3:40:22.560]  And man, you know what?
[3:40:22.560 --> 3:40:25.560]  I can prove the hijackers were trained at U.S. military bases and were CIA.
[3:40:25.560 --> 3:40:29.560]  And I got that from every angle document and made films about it.
[3:40:29.560 --> 3:40:37.560]  I can prove that the government has staged over 200 terror attacks and blamed it on foreign enemies and that's been declassified.
[3:40:37.560 --> 3:40:45.560]  I can prove that almost every major vaccine line out there is filled with cancer viruses and I have all the studies and news articles about it.
[3:40:45.560 --> 3:40:50.560]  I can prove that our government paid to have Israel radiate 110,000 of their own children.
[3:40:50.560 --> 3:40:54.560]  Israel and the U.S. are both go equally guilty in that.
[3:40:54.560 --> 3:40:56.560]  I can prove thousands of other things.
[3:40:56.560 --> 3:40:59.560]  But I notice there's a mass mental illness and there's a mass movement.
[3:40:59.560 --> 3:41:00.560]  And people wake up.
[3:41:00.560 --> 3:41:02.560]  It doesn't mean they fully have woken up.
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:04.560]  I haven't fully, you know, have all the answers.
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:05.560]  I'm finite.
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:06.560]  I'm a human being.
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:07.560]  I'm flawed.
[3:41:07.560 --> 3:41:11.560]  But, you know, I'll have Army War College reports.
[3:41:11.560 --> 3:41:17.560]  I'll have civilian and make labor camp program documents on army.mil.
[3:41:17.560 --> 3:41:19.560]  People never want to talk about that.
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:22.560]  Never want to talk about a Houston Chronicle article about the FEMA camps and American people.
[3:41:22.560 --> 3:41:25.560]  They always want to talk about the rumor that their cousin knew a guy that said,
[3:41:25.560 --> 3:41:31.560]  So, it's inculcated into us to cover things that can't be proven or things that can't be verified.
[3:41:31.560 --> 3:41:37.560]  Folks, we're successful here and we're hated and reviled and attacked by COINTELPRO.
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:41.560]  And then there are weak-minded people that follow that and believe they're self-righteously attacking me.
[3:41:41.560 --> 3:41:43.560]  We are the most attacked radio show.
[3:41:43.560 --> 3:41:47.560]  And the most attacked alternative media group out there, bar none.
[3:41:47.560 --> 3:41:48.560]  I mean, it is legion.
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:50.560]  It is organized.
[3:41:50.560 --> 3:41:54.560]  And they whip up the mindless public into joining in on it.
[3:41:54.560 --> 3:41:58.560]  Hey, that doesn't hurt me personally and doesn't even upset me personally,
[3:41:58.560 --> 3:42:04.560]  other than the fact that I know it's successful with some keeping those other activists from ever really blooming
[3:42:04.560 --> 3:42:07.560]  and being nicer to other activists and working together.
[3:42:07.560 --> 3:42:09.560]  And that doesn't mean everybody joining together.
[3:42:09.560 --> 3:42:14.560]  But, I mean, being friendly and working together and letting people disagree on a few things and moving forward.
[3:42:14.560 --> 3:42:15.560]  I mean, it's discernment.
[3:42:15.560 --> 3:42:18.560]  I really can't explain it to you.
[3:42:18.560 --> 3:42:24.560]  I mean, about a third or more of our movement spends its time infighting and saying,
[3:42:24.560 --> 3:42:25.560]  who do we trust?
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:26.560]  Who do we know?
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:28.560]  That's a decision for you to make.
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:29.560]  That's a decision for you to make.
[3:42:29.560 --> 3:42:32.560]  I said I'd take calls and I want to hurry here.
[3:42:32.560 --> 3:42:35.560]  Is James or Helen up next?
[3:42:35.560 --> 3:42:37.560]  Helen in Florida, go ahead.
[3:42:37.560 --> 3:42:38.560]  Yes, Alex.
[3:42:38.560 --> 3:42:40.560]  First of all, all actions preceded by thought.
[3:42:40.560 --> 3:42:43.560]  And your spirit is seeking truth and goodness.
[3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:46.560]  So you're trapped in that goal.
[3:42:46.560 --> 3:42:49.560]  Just keep, you can't give up if you're worth.
[3:42:49.560 --> 3:42:54.560]  And I wonder, too, if people who worked in banks, lovely family people, workers, tellers, et cetera,
[3:42:54.560 --> 3:42:57.560]  realize they're working toward their own destruction.
[3:42:57.560 --> 3:43:02.560]  If they did, it would be nice if they could all just leave and find some other temporary source income
[3:43:02.560 --> 3:43:06.560]  because they're, you know, just pretending they don't even realize what they're doing.
[3:43:06.560 --> 3:43:09.560]  And one more point I want to make, too.
[3:43:09.560 --> 3:43:15.560]  They're trying to have an amendment to declare marriage just between a man and woman.
[3:43:15.560 --> 3:43:16.560]  The Constitution.
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:23.560]  I don't know if people realize this might be cutting into the First Amendment in a spiritual choice.
[3:43:23.560 --> 3:43:27.560]  I don't believe in, there can be no marriage between two guys and two gays.
[3:43:27.560 --> 3:43:28.560]  No, I agree.
[3:43:28.560 --> 3:43:30.560]  Let me explain what my angle is and we'll see if you agree.
[3:43:30.560 --> 3:43:31.560]  Yeah.
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:36.560]  We didn't have marriage licenses until after the Civil War when in the south of the north
[3:43:36.560 --> 3:43:41.560]  black men were marrying white women.
[3:43:41.560 --> 3:43:50.560]  And when that started happening, they came in through the first eugenics laws by the 1870s in the U.S. out of Britain.
[3:43:50.560 --> 3:43:52.560]  This is mainline history.
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:57.560]  And they created the marriage license and they also did it under the 13th amendment.
[3:43:57.560 --> 3:44:05.560]  So basically they said you have to have a certified marriage and now the states getting involved in the marriage
[3:44:05.560 --> 3:44:07.560]  certifying and allowing that.
[3:44:07.560 --> 3:44:12.560]  I believe the state shouldn't be involved and I agree that is a spiritual choice.
[3:44:12.560 --> 3:44:18.560]  Why do we have government involved in marriages and with children and in stealing children and all this great evil?
[3:44:18.560 --> 3:44:19.560]  Exactly.
[3:44:19.560 --> 3:44:25.560]  It's not the government's role to be certifying two men living together, two women living together.
[3:44:25.560 --> 3:44:27.560]  It's certainly not the federal government's role.
[3:44:27.560 --> 3:44:32.560]  You can argue it's the state government's role, but the state has now wrecked the family.
[3:44:32.560 --> 3:44:35.560]  All the numbers are clear on that, the statistics.
[3:44:35.560 --> 3:44:37.560]  State gets involved in the family in the fifties.
[3:44:37.560 --> 3:44:45.560]  It goes from 90 plus percent legitimacy to what half legitimacy now more crime families falling apart all by design.
[3:44:45.560 --> 3:44:46.560]  So absolutely right.
[3:44:46.560 --> 3:44:53.560]  They put us into these false debates and trying to bring in a constitutional convention for an amendment on marriage.
[3:44:53.560 --> 3:44:59.560]  That then brings in more federal power and it could allow and it's a big diversion.
[3:44:59.560 --> 3:45:06.560]  It also then allows a constitutional convention where they can pass other amendments.
[3:45:06.560 --> 3:45:09.560]  What do you say to them apples, Helen?
[3:45:09.560 --> 3:45:11.560]  I agree fully with what you're saying.
[3:45:11.560 --> 3:45:12.560]  That's logic, yes.
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:14.560]  But who uses that these days?
[3:45:14.560 --> 3:45:15.560]  Oh, no.
[3:45:15.560 --> 3:45:17.560]  It can't happen.
[3:45:17.560 --> 3:45:21.560]  But also, I know we believe in Jesus' golden rule.
[3:45:21.560 --> 3:45:25.560]  Instead of a couple thousand years ago, that kingdom company will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[3:45:25.560 --> 3:45:27.560]  He wasn't making small talk.
[3:45:27.560 --> 3:45:29.560]  He said so, so it will happen.
[3:45:29.560 --> 3:45:32.560]  I wish it would happen this weekend, but it's in his own time.
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:33.560]  I hear you.
[3:45:33.560 --> 3:45:34.560]  So I'll give up, Alex.
[3:45:34.560 --> 3:45:35.560]  I'm never going to give up.
[3:45:35.560 --> 3:45:36.560]  I can't give up.
[3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:37.560]  Are you kidding?
[3:45:37.560 --> 3:45:38.560]  I'm just completely overtaken by this.
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:40.560]  It's all I think about now.
[3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:42.560]  It gets more intense every day.
[3:45:42.560 --> 3:45:44.560]  It tears me apart.
[3:45:44.560 --> 3:45:45.560]  It's uplifting.
[3:45:45.560 --> 3:45:46.560]  It's enthusing.
[3:45:46.560 --> 3:45:47.560]  It's invigorating.
[3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:49.560]  It's also very painful.
[3:45:49.560 --> 3:45:52.560]  It's an intensification of all the senses.
[3:45:52.560 --> 3:45:54.560]  It is truly living.
[3:45:54.560 --> 3:45:57.560]  I feel like I'm just going to explode.
[3:45:57.560 --> 3:45:58.560]  Oh my gosh.
[3:45:58.560 --> 3:45:59.560]  Let's go to Mike in Tennessee.
[3:45:59.560 --> 3:46:01.560]  You're on the air worldwide, Mike.
[3:46:01.560 --> 3:46:02.560]  Alex.
[3:46:02.560 --> 3:46:03.560]  Hey, Alex.
[3:46:03.560 --> 3:46:04.560]  Can you hear me okay?
[3:46:04.560 --> 3:46:05.560]  Yes, I can.
[3:46:05.560 --> 3:46:06.560]  Okay.
[3:46:06.560 --> 3:46:10.000]  Yesterday they announced that all Memphis City School students will be issued an ID card
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:12.560]  that will track their every move while in the school.
[3:46:12.560 --> 3:46:15.560]  The store is on the newspaper this morning on the front page.
[3:46:15.560 --> 3:46:16.560]  That's in Mississippi?
[3:46:16.560 --> 3:46:17.560]  Memphis, Tennessee.
[3:46:17.560 --> 3:46:18.560]  Oh, okay.
[3:46:18.560 --> 3:46:22.560]  Your phone cut out and it sounded like you said Memphis, Tennessee.
[3:46:22.560 --> 3:46:23.560]  Okay.
[3:46:23.560 --> 3:46:28.560]  I ran a new school superintendent from down in, I believe, State County, Florida.
[3:46:28.560 --> 3:46:31.560]  He's new here and he's brought this program up.
[3:46:31.560 --> 3:46:33.560]  It's going to be an ID card that can track.
[3:46:33.560 --> 3:46:36.560]  Apparently they're putting in surveillance equipment in the schools that will track.
[3:46:36.560 --> 3:46:37.560]  The feds are paying for all that.
[3:46:37.560 --> 3:46:41.560]  It's the same worldwide from Russia to China to the U.S.
[3:46:41.560 --> 3:46:44.560]  Tracking them cameras and bathrooms up to the police department.
[3:46:44.560 --> 3:46:46.560]  Your children are now prisoners.
[3:46:46.560 --> 3:46:47.560]  Yes.
[3:46:47.560 --> 3:46:51.560]  This morning on a local talk radio program, they were talking about the terrorist situation.
[3:46:51.560 --> 3:46:57.560]  They were wanting to get people to agree that habeas corpus and due process was not a necessity
[3:46:57.560 --> 3:46:59.560]  of people that were classified as terrorists.
[3:46:59.560 --> 3:47:01.560]  I called in and I asked the guy had he read the Patriot Act.
[3:47:01.560 --> 3:47:02.560]  Well, he said he had.
[3:47:02.560 --> 3:47:07.560]  I said, well, you understand under the Patriot Act, any American citizen accused of dissent,
[3:47:07.560 --> 3:47:11.560]  just disagreeing with the government, could be declared a terrorist and held in Guantanamo
[3:47:11.560 --> 3:47:14.560]  without any of these rights provided under the Constitution.
[3:47:14.560 --> 3:47:16.560]  No due process whatsoever.
[3:47:16.560 --> 3:47:20.560]  I asked if he agreed with that and he responded, well, you're that crazy guy who likes Ron Paul.
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:25.560]  Well, I let him go on for a while and then I said, you need to get rid of these people
[3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:28.560]  in Washington that can't read or understand the Constitution.
[3:47:28.560 --> 3:47:31.560]  Well, he immediately responded that I want to kill them.
[3:47:31.560 --> 3:47:32.560]  See, that's what they're wanting to do.
[3:47:32.560 --> 3:47:36.560]  No, no, it's all folks this entire secret police telltale squads.
[3:47:36.560 --> 3:47:37.560]  It's for us folks.
[3:47:37.560 --> 3:47:38.560]  They admit it.
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:43.560]  I told him, I just said that they ought to be impeached and then he went off into 9-11.
[3:47:43.560 --> 3:47:45.560]  Well, I gave him some more information.
[3:47:45.560 --> 3:47:49.560]  I said, what about the fact that there's not a single frame of footage of a plane hitting
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:54.560]  Pentagon and you can't fit 158-foot wingspan through a 16-foot wide hole.
[3:47:54.560 --> 3:47:56.560]  And I said, my degree is mechanical engineering.
[3:47:56.560 --> 3:48:02.560]  I've studied the buildings that fell and the different information that's out there.
[3:48:02.560 --> 3:48:04.560]  This stuff didn't happen.
[3:48:04.560 --> 3:48:10.560]  And immediately he shut me off and then, well, he said he was going to come back with some
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:12.560]  photos of planes hitting the building.
[3:48:12.560 --> 3:48:14.560]  I asked him to post it on his website or email me.
[3:48:14.560 --> 3:48:15.560]  He said he wouldn't post it.
[3:48:15.560 --> 3:48:16.560]  He said he would email me.
[3:48:16.560 --> 3:48:17.560]  He hasn't.
[3:48:17.560 --> 3:48:19.560]  But immediately hung up.
[3:48:19.560 --> 3:48:21.560]  Then he had two of these people call in.
[3:48:21.560 --> 3:48:24.560]  I know they're not regular callers, but two guys called in.
[3:48:24.560 --> 3:48:28.560]  One said he was working with FEMA at the Pentagon when this happened, said they found engines
[3:48:28.560 --> 3:48:30.560]  and landing gear.
[3:48:30.560 --> 3:48:35.560]  I've never heard anybody say they found engines and a landing gear of a 757 inside the Pentagon.
[3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:36.560]  They didn't.
[3:48:36.560 --> 3:48:38.560]  I didn't think so.
[3:48:38.560 --> 3:48:43.560]  Well, you see, for the CIA people who are taking over all the cities, there's big money in this.
[3:48:43.560 --> 3:48:47.560]  And a lot of these people calling into shows are operatives.
[3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:49.560]  And it's just, that's what they want to know.
[3:48:49.560 --> 3:48:50.560]  You want to kill people now.
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:52.560]  You need to be arrested.
[3:48:52.560 --> 3:48:53.560]  That's what they're doing.
[3:48:53.560 --> 3:48:55.560]  So people need to be aware of the fact.
[3:48:55.560 --> 3:48:59.560]  If you call in and voice your opinion, they're going to try to corner you and ask you a question.
[3:48:59.560 --> 3:49:04.560]  And basically three people said that I was a crazy nut job on this radio program, including the host.
[3:49:04.560 --> 3:49:11.560]  And that's what they're trying to do is as this last person that was discredited, everybody that is suicidal is crazy.
[3:49:11.560 --> 3:49:15.560]  That's what they do. They target you by claiming you're suicidal or you're a nut job.
[3:49:15.560 --> 3:49:16.560]  Or you want to kill people.
[3:49:16.560 --> 3:49:17.560]  Yeah, I hear you.
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:18.560]  I appreciate your call.
[3:49:18.560 --> 3:49:19.560]  It's bad.
[3:49:19.560 --> 3:49:20.560]  Thank you, Mike.
[3:49:20.560 --> 3:49:23.560]  James in Ohio, you're on the air.
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:24.560]  Mr. Jones.
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:25.560]  Yes, sir.
[3:49:25.560 --> 3:49:26.560]  Talk to you.
[3:49:26.560 --> 3:49:27.560]  It's a true honor.
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:28.560]  Honored to talk to you.
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:33.560]  I do want to thank you for all you do and wake up every morning and fight the good fight.
[3:49:33.560 --> 3:49:35.560]  I have a question.
[3:49:35.560 --> 3:49:44.560]  I'm a member of Prison Planet TV and I listened to one of your audio interviews about Mahoma Ata and Venice Flying Circus.
[3:49:44.560 --> 3:49:48.560]  I can't find that video on Prison Planet TV.
[3:49:48.560 --> 3:49:51.560]  I don't know if I got like dropped off or whatever.
[3:49:51.560 --> 3:49:53.560]  I don't know if you would maybe put it back up there.
[3:49:53.560 --> 3:49:56.560]  No, a lot of people authorize us to post their videos.
[3:49:56.560 --> 3:50:00.560]  He authorized me to and then about two years later said you're not authorized to.
[3:50:00.560 --> 3:50:02.560]  And so I took it down.
[3:50:02.560 --> 3:50:07.560]  And another quick question to just let you answer this.
[3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:13.560]  My horse was taken out of the race a while ago, so I'm stuck with checking out Bob Barr.
[3:50:13.560 --> 3:50:15.560]  What's your opinion on him?
[3:50:15.560 --> 3:50:18.560]  I don't completely trust him.
[3:50:18.560 --> 3:50:20.560]  And his voting records are not that good.
[3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:21.560]  It's better to compare to some.
[3:50:21.560 --> 3:50:24.560]  I like what he said in the impeachment hearing a few weeks ago.
[3:50:24.560 --> 3:50:28.560]  But, you know, the federal thing's all a big distraction.
[3:50:28.560 --> 3:50:32.560]  I mean, we should fight in the elections to educate people, but that's really about it.
[3:50:32.560 --> 3:50:34.560]  Local fights is where it's all at.
[3:50:34.560 --> 3:50:37.560]  All right, so activating all your sectors, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:39.560]  This is Tototo Combat with the New World Order.
[3:50:44.560 --> 3:50:46.560]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[3:50:46.560 --> 3:50:50.560]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[3:50:50.560 --> 3:50:52.560]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[3:50:52.560 --> 3:50:55.560]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:50:55.560 --> 3:51:01.560]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[3:51:01.560 --> 3:51:05.560]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[3:51:05.560 --> 3:51:10.560]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[3:51:10.560 --> 3:51:13.560]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[3:51:43.560 --> 3:51:45.560]  Prisonplanet.tv
[3:51:45.560 --> 3:51:47.560]  Life has changed.
[3:51:47.560 --> 3:51:49.560]  We're not 21 anymore.
[3:51:49.560 --> 3:51:52.560]  We have responsibilities.
[3:51:52.560 --> 3:51:55.560]  That's why there's Drink and Made Hangover Defense.
[3:51:55.560 --> 3:51:57.560]  Sure, we've done our share of partying.
[3:51:57.560 --> 3:51:58.560]  Yeah, dude.
[3:51:58.560 --> 3:52:02.560]  Now kicking back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style.
[3:52:02.560 --> 3:52:08.560]  But let's face it, as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[3:52:08.560 --> 3:52:13.560]  With Drink and Made, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[3:52:13.560 --> 3:52:25.560]  Drink and Made's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind.
[3:52:25.560 --> 3:52:29.560]  Just dissolve one Drink and Made in water and take it before bed.
[3:52:29.560 --> 3:52:30.560]  It's that easy.
[3:52:30.560 --> 3:52:34.560]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities.
[3:52:34.560 --> 3:52:38.560]  Drink and Made Hangover Defense is available at retailers nationwide.
[3:52:38.560 --> 3:52:40.560]  Pick up some today.
[3:52:40.560 --> 3:52:43.560]  Drink and Made Hangover Defense is available at retailers nationwide.
[3:53:30.560 --> 3:53:35.560]  For their website and more info, call 1-800-753-1981.
[3:53:35.560 --> 3:53:38.560]  That's 1-800-753-1981.
[3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:42.560]  And remember, if you wait until you meet us, it's too late.
[3:53:42.560 --> 3:53:43.560]  Call now.
[3:53:46.560 --> 3:53:47.560]  Take a few final calls.
[3:53:47.560 --> 3:53:51.560]  There's been some new developments in the anthrax case.
[3:53:51.560 --> 3:53:52.560]  This is really getting ridiculous.
[3:53:52.560 --> 3:53:55.560]  They now claim they released 200 documents.
[3:53:55.560 --> 3:53:57.560]  He's the sole person that ever handled the AIMS strain.
[3:53:57.560 --> 3:54:01.560]  They're doing that to counter scientists there that say he wasn't even working with that.
[3:54:01.560 --> 3:54:09.560]  But he's the sole guy they're saying whoever had contact with it, even though another guy broke in where it was at,
[3:54:09.560 --> 3:54:13.560]  and they ignore that, even though they claimed before it was Hatfield that was working with it,
[3:54:13.560 --> 3:54:16.560]  and then he met it in a bathtub somewhere, Burmese.
[3:54:16.560 --> 3:54:23.560]  Yeah, they're saying right now that this is the sole guy to handle RMR-1029, the AIMS strain.
[3:54:23.560 --> 3:54:30.560]  Now, they're saying, I think they're also alluding to the fact that somehow he mutated the virus from that strain.
[3:54:30.560 --> 3:54:34.560]  But since it went back to Fort Detrick, now they're saying they're finding all sorts of stuff.
[3:54:34.560 --> 3:54:36.560]  They found a plague book.
[3:54:36.560 --> 3:54:39.560]  I mean, this guy is a biological engineer.
[3:54:39.560 --> 3:54:41.560]  Of course, he's going to read stuff like this.
[3:54:41.560 --> 3:54:42.560]  So they're trying to frame him there.
[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:43.560]  Well, it's a bacterium again.
[3:54:43.560 --> 3:54:44.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:54:44.560 --> 3:54:46.560]  And now they're saying four years, he's the only guy that handled it.
[3:54:46.560 --> 3:54:48.560]  Remember, this has happened in 2001.
[3:54:48.560 --> 3:54:51.560]  He was the sole guy who had it since 97.
[3:54:51.560 --> 3:54:56.560]  Yet, they just held a service forum at Fort Detrick, Maryland that the press was barred from.
[3:54:56.560 --> 3:55:00.560]  So this guy is supposedly the guy that killed five people.
[3:55:00.560 --> 3:55:04.560]  Well, they're having to say this now because all these scientists that work with him said he wasn't even working with it.
[3:55:04.560 --> 3:55:05.560]  And it isn't even the right DNA.
[3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:10.560]  We're going to see a lot in the next few days and over the weekend of them bombarding this guy.
[3:55:10.560 --> 3:55:13.560]  He'll be guilty in the court of public opinion, Alex.
[3:55:13.560 --> 3:55:15.560]  And that's just the way they're going to wrap this up.
[3:55:15.560 --> 3:55:20.560]  This guy was suicidal, homicidal, sociopathic, apparently.
[3:55:20.560 --> 3:55:26.560]  And, you know, there's no evidence that he had anything, any kind of sympathy for the Muslims.
[3:55:26.560 --> 3:55:31.560]  No reason that he would have sent those four letters that saying death to Israel, death to America.
[3:55:31.560 --> 3:55:33.560]  This is just the beginning.
[3:55:33.560 --> 3:55:35.560]  Why was the White House on separate?
[3:55:35.560 --> 3:55:36.560]  Yeah.
[3:55:36.560 --> 3:55:37.560]  Thanks, Burmese.
[3:55:37.560 --> 3:55:38.560]  We'll cover it more tomorrow.
[3:55:38.560 --> 3:55:39.560]  Thank you.
[3:55:39.560 --> 3:55:40.560]  Okay.
[3:55:40.560 --> 3:55:41.560]  Let's jam in some final calls.
[3:55:41.560 --> 3:55:42.560]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air.
[3:55:42.560 --> 3:55:43.560]  Yeah.
[3:55:43.560 --> 3:55:45.560]  Turn your radio off, brother.
[3:55:45.560 --> 3:55:46.560]  Okay.
[3:55:46.560 --> 3:55:49.560]  Let's move on to Taylor in Ohio.
[3:55:49.560 --> 3:55:54.560]  Go ahead.
[3:55:54.560 --> 3:55:55.560]  Come on.
[3:55:55.560 --> 3:55:56.560]  Come on.
[3:55:56.560 --> 3:55:57.560]  Sorry about that.
[3:55:57.560 --> 3:56:00.560]  I'm talking to a YouTube partner about reporting on the blocked websites.
[3:56:00.560 --> 3:56:02.560]  And he wants to list of these websites.
[3:56:02.560 --> 3:56:03.560]  Can I get one of those?
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:06.560]  Well, I mean, there's a lot of websites that are being blocked.
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:10.560]  It depends on what filtration system it is.
[3:56:10.560 --> 3:56:11.560]  Okay.
[3:56:11.560 --> 3:56:15.560]  Just like the UK sites, he's doing a report on them.
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:16.560]  Do you want a few sites?
[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:20.560]  Well, there's all sorts of articles written about web censorship and web filtering.
[3:56:20.560 --> 3:56:23.560]  But prisonplanet.com and infowars.com are among them.
[3:56:23.560 --> 3:56:25.560]  And we list some of the others in the stories we wrote.
[3:56:25.560 --> 3:56:27.560]  You'll have to do a little research.
[3:56:27.560 --> 3:56:28.560]  Okay.
[3:56:28.560 --> 3:56:29.560]  Thanks a lot.
[3:56:29.560 --> 3:56:30.560]  Thank you, my friend.
[3:56:30.560 --> 3:56:31.560]  Okay.
[3:56:31.560 --> 3:56:32.560]  Let's see if Mike in Arizona is back.
[3:56:32.560 --> 3:56:34.560]  Mike, are you back now?
[3:56:34.560 --> 3:56:35.560]  Yes.
[3:56:35.560 --> 3:56:36.560]  Go ahead.
[3:56:36.560 --> 3:56:37.560]  Yes.
[3:56:37.560 --> 3:56:38.560]  Yeah.
[3:56:38.560 --> 3:56:41.560]  I wanted to give you some good news, brother, with all the bad things that's been happening.
[3:56:41.560 --> 3:56:44.560]  I know that you're familiar with another talk show host.
[3:56:44.560 --> 3:56:46.560]  I believe he's your good friend, George Norrie.
[3:56:46.560 --> 3:56:47.560]  Yes.
[3:56:47.560 --> 3:56:52.560]  And he had had a program on supposedly about a time traveler by the name of John Teter.
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:56:53.560]  Oh, I don't get into that.
[3:56:53.560 --> 3:56:55.560]  I mean, I'll let me just tell you the good news.
[3:56:55.560 --> 3:56:57.560]  He had supposedly come from the year 2030.
[3:56:57.560 --> 3:56:59.560]  And one thing he said that really got me excited.
[3:56:59.560 --> 3:57:03.560]  He said, a new world order by the year 2036 will be abolished.
[3:57:03.560 --> 3:57:05.560]  We win.
[3:57:05.560 --> 3:57:07.560]  Well, let's just hope that's all true.
[3:57:07.560 --> 3:57:09.560]  But I don't get into time traveling the rest of it.
[3:57:09.560 --> 3:57:10.560]  Thank you.
[3:57:10.560 --> 3:57:11.560]  Oh, my goodness.
[3:57:11.560 --> 3:57:13.560]  Brooke in Canada or no Bronco in Canada.
[3:57:13.560 --> 3:57:14.560]  Go ahead.
[3:57:14.560 --> 3:57:15.560]  Hey, Alex.
[3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:16.560]  How's it going?
[3:57:16.560 --> 3:57:17.560]  Good.
[3:57:17.560 --> 3:57:21.560]  Alex, I was wondering what your thoughts on the arrest of Radovan Karadzic.
[3:57:21.560 --> 3:57:27.560]  Well, it's come out that they tried to hire him and had some deal with like Richard Holbrook
[3:57:27.560 --> 3:57:28.560]  and Madeleine Albright.
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:29.560]  Yeah.
[3:57:29.560 --> 3:57:30.560]  No, I have that right here.
[3:57:30.560 --> 3:57:31.560]  Yes.
[3:57:31.560 --> 3:57:32.560]  What are your thoughts on that?
[3:57:32.560 --> 3:57:33.560]  Just more bull.
[3:57:33.560 --> 3:57:37.560]  They, I mean, they killed Slobo in the UN Tribunal holding cells.
[3:57:37.560 --> 3:57:38.560]  They admitted he was poison.
[3:57:38.560 --> 3:57:39.560]  They say he did it himself.
[3:57:39.560 --> 3:57:41.560]  I mean, more stage deals.
[3:57:41.560 --> 3:57:42.560]  Yeah.
[3:57:42.560 --> 3:57:48.560]  What do you also think of like Obama's talking about topping the strategic oil reserves to
[3:57:48.560 --> 3:57:49.560]  lower gas prices?
[3:57:49.560 --> 3:57:51.560]  I guess I am guessing it's just a second election.
[3:57:51.560 --> 3:57:52.560]  Yeah.
[3:57:52.560 --> 3:57:53.560]  That's a diversion.
[3:57:53.560 --> 3:57:54.560]  That's a diversion.
[3:57:54.560 --> 3:57:56.560]  They need to open up Alaska to us.
[3:57:56.560 --> 3:57:59.560]  They're going to open it up, but just not for us going to go to foreign countries.
[3:57:59.560 --> 3:58:00.560]  We're out of time.
[3:58:00.560 --> 3:58:01.560]  What a show today.
[3:58:01.560 --> 3:58:05.560]  We probably took 50 phone calls and I sure enjoyed taking your calls.
