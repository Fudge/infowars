[00:00.000 --> 00:04.500]  It makes zero sense.
[00:04.500 --> 00:09.380]  Every year, millions of U.S. citizens pay their taxes under the oppressive 16th Amendment
[00:09.380 --> 00:14.800]  under a corporatic system hijacked by an oligarchy disguised as a republic.
[00:14.800 --> 00:20.360]  As criminal illegal immigrant facilities aiding the cartel's drugs and human trafficking schemes,
[00:20.360 --> 00:26.560]  fueling the United Nations' replacement migration plans are built with those same tax dollars.
[00:26.560 --> 00:33.600]  We should have a European response as part of a global response.
[00:33.600 --> 00:35.640]  We need structures.
[00:35.640 --> 00:42.520]  How is it, for an example at the moment, that the assessment of whether a person is or is
[00:42.520 --> 00:51.920]  not a refugee conducted at national level has widely different results in different countries?
[00:51.920 --> 00:57.280]  Meanwhile, Biden's approval ratings continue to plummet over his pseudo-handling prosurge
[00:57.280 --> 00:58.280]  of the border.
[00:58.280 --> 00:59.920]  But do the polls even matter?
[00:59.920 --> 01:06.400]  And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them,
[01:06.400 --> 01:15.760]  keep them safe until they can be heard.
[01:15.760 --> 01:20.680]  To add insult to financial injury, the United States General Accounting Office wrote back
[01:20.680 --> 01:28.280]  in 1993, GAO obtained cost estimates from the five states that account for about 80%
[01:28.280 --> 01:30.240]  of the illegal immigrant population.
[01:30.240 --> 01:35.320]  California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Florida are estimated to spend $2.9 billion
[01:35.320 --> 01:40.400]  in annual federal, state and local costs for illegal aliens and their children.
[01:40.400 --> 01:45.560]  Under the Medicaid program, they are eligible for emergency services only, including labor
[01:45.560 --> 01:46.560]  and delivery.
[01:46.560 --> 01:51.560]  Some programs such as the supplemental food program for women, infants and children, WIC
[01:51.560 --> 01:56.200]  and school nutrition programs are available to all those who qualify regardless of their
[01:56.200 --> 01:57.560]  immigration status.
[01:57.560 --> 02:01.960]  And the Supreme Court has ruled that illegal alien children may not be denied a public
[02:01.960 --> 02:02.960]  education.
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.480]  Illegal aliens may also be receiving public housing assistance, even though by law they
[02:07.480 --> 02:09.400]  are not eligible for these benefits.
[02:09.400 --> 02:14.720]  In addition, illegal aliens may apply for AFDC and food stamps on behalf of their U.S.
[02:14.720 --> 02:19.720]  citizen children, though it is the child and not the parent in such cases who qualifies
[02:19.720 --> 02:23.600]  for the programs benefits help support the child's family.
[02:23.600 --> 02:30.000]  In 2016, U.S. immigration and customs enforcement revealed that 124 illegal immigrant criminals
[02:30.000 --> 02:35.880]  released from jail by the Obama administration since 2010 had been subsequently charged with
[02:35.880 --> 02:36.880]  murder.
[02:36.880 --> 02:40.880]  And now as the Heritage Foundation points out, when the Trump administration ended, the
[02:40.880 --> 02:45.000]  U.S. was deporting more people than were illegally coming into the country.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.080]  In less than a month under Biden, the number of people illegally coming into the country
[02:49.080 --> 02:51.360]  is more than 6,000 per day.
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.200]  That's six times the crisis level as set by the Obama team.
[02:55.200 --> 02:58.360]  What will Biden's released murder numbers add up to?
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.600]  Yes, March the 2nd, which tomorrow is anniversary, I guess you can call it anniversary.
[03:03.600 --> 03:08.840]  He was shot in the street like a dog by a legal alien gangbanger who was on his third
[03:08.840 --> 03:13.520]  gun charge was just released from the L.A. County jail that same day.
[03:13.520 --> 03:20.800]  She was heading back from church on February 19th with our older son who is 18, heading
[03:20.800 --> 03:23.200]  back from church.
[03:23.200 --> 03:32.720]  When she began across the intersection, she was struck by this, a strato, illegal immigrant
[03:32.720 --> 03:33.720]  and killed instantly.
[03:33.720 --> 03:36.160]  Don, you heard what Nancy Pelosi had to say.
[03:36.160 --> 03:38.760]  She said, well, it's just kind of the price of doing business.
[03:38.760 --> 03:39.920]  These things will happen.
[03:39.920 --> 03:44.120]  What's your response to the speaker?
[03:44.120 --> 03:47.480]  My husband was not the price of doing business.
[03:47.480 --> 03:51.920]  My husband on his way back to the station to get a little bit of rest after, you know,
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.560]  helping someone killed by an illegal.
[03:54.560 --> 03:59.360]  This year, Congress gave our illegal overlords nearly four and a half billion in COVID relief
[03:59.360 --> 04:03.720]  stimulus money, regardless of the fact that they have no social security numbers.
[04:03.720 --> 04:08.160]  That is, unless you count the 2 million using fraudulent social security numbers that were
[04:08.160 --> 04:09.480]  used to cash in.
[04:09.480 --> 04:15.360]  And now in New York, enclaves of undocumented workers who lost work during the pandemic will
[04:15.360 --> 04:23.680]  now receive one time payments of up to $15,600, nearly four times the amount American workers
[04:23.680 --> 04:26.840]  received from their own taxes.
[04:26.840 --> 04:31.880]  Disadvantaged Americans, inner city youth, members of minority groups and immigrants
[04:31.880 --> 04:37.280]  who haven't adjusted to life in the United States yet, when you bring in a huge mass
[04:37.280 --> 04:43.800]  of uneducated, unskilled individuals to directly compete against Americans, those Americans
[04:43.800 --> 04:44.800]  suffer.
[04:44.800 --> 04:50.080]  It's getting so lopsided that in the very near future, it may make good fiscal sense
[04:50.080 --> 04:55.480]  for some Americans to renounce their citizenship and become an illegal in their own country.
[04:55.480 --> 05:02.600]  John Bount reporting, you cannot hide a grand assault.
[05:02.600 --> 05:07.560]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought
[05:07.560 --> 05:09.240]  down to nothing.
[05:09.240 --> 05:14.520]  All of you that have served Satan, believe that you are on the right team, you're about
[05:14.520 --> 05:17.240]  to find out how pathetic you are.
[05:17.240 --> 05:24.480]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[05:24.480 --> 05:29.600]  The enemy is about to expose itself, the enemy can't help itself.
[05:29.600 --> 05:33.640]  The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy.
[05:33.640 --> 05:39.280]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it, we should, but once
[05:39.280 --> 05:44.800]  it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[05:44.800 --> 05:49.160]  us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[05:49.160 --> 05:51.320]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[05:51.320 --> 05:54.960]  We're going under judgements just like all the children that were aborted.
[05:54.960 --> 05:56.600]  This is the truth.
[05:56.600 --> 06:15.600]  This is the InfoWare.
[06:15.600 --> 06:28.560]  Tomorrow's news today.
[06:28.560 --> 06:33.320]  It's Monday, April 12th, the year is 2021.
[06:33.320 --> 06:37.760]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm extremely honored and blessed to be here.
[06:37.760 --> 06:39.720]  Thank you for keeping us on air.
[06:39.720 --> 06:41.400]  Thank you for holding us in place.
[06:41.400 --> 06:43.560]  Thank you for your prayers and your support.
[06:43.560 --> 06:46.320]  You are everything.
[06:46.320 --> 06:51.480]  Well, I have had extreme brainstorms last night and this morning, and it's just all
[06:51.480 --> 06:55.240]  hit me stronger than ever what we're facing in the enemy timeline.
[06:55.240 --> 06:59.840]  Now that we're so close to this thing, I can tell you very clearly what's going to happen
[06:59.840 --> 07:03.000]  next unless we completely stop this.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.400]  So when I talk about the post-human world, when I talk about an artificial end of the
[07:06.400 --> 07:11.320]  world that doesn't mean complete end of the world, but technically the end of the world
[07:11.320 --> 07:15.440]  as we know it, that is if we don't take action.
[07:15.440 --> 07:18.400]  And I've been very bold with my family.
[07:18.400 --> 07:22.080]  I've been very bold with my friends about this the last few days, and I'm being very
[07:22.080 --> 07:23.080]  bold with you.
[07:23.080 --> 07:26.520]  But I want you to know this is non-hyperbole.
[07:26.520 --> 07:33.440]  On their current trajectory, by the year 2030, there will be a 90% world population reduction,
[07:33.440 --> 07:40.360]  as Klaus Schwab said, that will cure poverty, cure war, cure everything because there won't
[07:40.360 --> 07:43.640]  be any people to speak of basically left.
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.680]  It's very, very sick.
[07:47.680 --> 07:53.600]  And if you oppose this, the ADL comes out and calls you a Nazi.
[07:53.600 --> 07:57.120]  When at anything, this is Nazi-esque to the max.
[07:57.120 --> 07:59.120]  This is Nazi super science.
[07:59.120 --> 08:06.280]  This is what the Nazis got from the Darwinian eugenicists in the U.S. and the U.K. that
[08:06.280 --> 08:10.040]  created the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and all the rest of it.
[08:10.040 --> 08:16.800]  So, this is the world we live in, and I can tell you, and I've told you this many times,
[08:16.800 --> 08:22.000]  that they're running on a bunch of paths, but they all go basically the same place.
[08:22.000 --> 08:23.000]  It's like choose your adventure.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  Well, the globalists have to choose their adventure.
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.040]  They have a lot of different tracks, a lot of different tasks, a lot of different systems,
[08:29.040 --> 08:32.320]  and they're always augmenting and adjusting as they go.
[08:32.320 --> 08:37.520]  It's kind of like the new artillery the Pentagon has that can shoot targets 45 miles away.
[08:37.520 --> 08:43.280]  It fires, and its GPS has got little fins and tiny little boosters on it, and it can
[08:43.280 --> 08:46.080]  hit a tank at 45 miles away, even moving.
[08:46.080 --> 08:47.720]  Well, it's the same thing.
[08:47.720 --> 08:51.240]  They aim at the target, they've got the target, they fire, and then it's just adjusting as
[08:51.240 --> 08:52.240]  it goes.
[08:52.240 --> 08:55.600]  And they write the white papers, they have speeches, they go on C-span and say, we're
[08:55.600 --> 08:58.880]  weather-controlling everything, and then we talk about it, and they say, that doesn't
[08:58.880 --> 09:03.080]  exist and MSNBC make a joke.
[09:03.080 --> 09:08.040]  It's a breakaway civilization, and it's a civilization where we're going to be dead.
[09:08.040 --> 09:09.600]  Now here's the deal.
[09:09.600 --> 09:11.720]  I can join them.
[09:11.720 --> 09:14.880]  I can still join them, did you know that?
[09:14.880 --> 09:18.520]  Almost no one else is even serving it is even going to be allowed to join these people.
[09:18.520 --> 09:23.040]  I am not going to join them, but the door has been opened yet again recently for me
[09:23.040 --> 09:24.760]  to join them.
[09:24.760 --> 09:28.080]  They really want to get people to understand all this on their team.
[09:28.080 --> 09:30.800]  They think it's a good thing they're doing.
[09:30.800 --> 09:34.880]  I've been around some of these top globalists, and let me tell you, the vibe is enough to
[09:34.880 --> 09:36.240]  make me never join them.
[09:36.240 --> 09:40.520]  This is spiritual, ladies and gentlemen, and they want you to go with them.
[09:40.520 --> 09:44.880]  Just like a third of the angels went with this piece of crap, and he's trying the same
[09:44.880 --> 09:45.880]  thing right now.
[09:45.880 --> 09:49.480]  This is an alien force, and everybody knows it.
[09:49.480 --> 09:51.680]  So here's the broadcast today.
[09:51.680 --> 09:56.840]  We've got something just as big as spars 2528 from the same people, John Hopkins, I'll
[09:56.840 --> 10:02.560]  be telling you about that next hour, Owen Schreuer is going to be in the valley at a
[10:02.560 --> 10:08.360]  teaborder facility that I'm not going to mention until he's there in about 30 minutes.
[10:08.360 --> 10:11.560]  But we'll have live coverage of that, then he'll be doing the whole fourth hour with
[10:11.560 --> 10:17.840]  me from a very special place that we'll tell you about at that time today on the ground.
[10:17.840 --> 10:21.280]  So look for that.
[10:21.280 --> 10:23.320]  We also have Ezra Levant of Rebel News.
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.160]  We now have the incredible images that broke in the middle of the show yesterday of hundreds
[10:27.160 --> 10:32.960]  of riot police pushing citizens out, trying to prey in a field at their church that's
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.680]  been shut down, but a Walmart is, again, a mile and a half away and totally open, and
[10:37.680 --> 10:38.680]  you're like, this is outrageous.
[10:38.680 --> 10:46.080]  Well, it's outrageous like having the prime minister, Trudeau, say, I want Canada to be
[10:46.080 --> 10:49.680]  a dictatorship like China that Xi Jinping has set up.
[10:49.680 --> 10:52.440]  I mean, that's a quote.
[10:52.440 --> 10:55.000]  And then now you see it.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.920]  We showed another video that showed the crowd.
[10:56.920 --> 10:57.920]  That's what's beautiful.
[10:57.920 --> 10:58.920]  We can show that.
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.280]  Thousands of Christians out there praying, normally the church has about 200 members.
[11:03.280 --> 11:04.280]  Thousands there.
[11:04.280 --> 11:11.920]  So it's definitely, definitely starting to backfire on them, and that's the answer.
[11:11.920 --> 11:13.920]  But they've got a larger plan to do this.
[11:13.920 --> 11:16.720]  They're just conditioning the public to accept all of this.
[11:16.720 --> 11:21.160]  So Owen Schreuer and Ezra Levant on the broadcast.
[11:21.160 --> 11:23.120]  Okay, let me do this.
[11:23.120 --> 11:25.400]  Let me just give you an example of what we're dealing with here.
[11:25.400 --> 11:27.600]  Overhead shot, please.
[11:27.600 --> 11:31.560]  Biden men threatens consequences of construction for military buildup in Ukraine, threatens
[11:31.560 --> 11:32.560]  military action.
[11:32.560 --> 11:33.560]  Insane escalation.
[11:33.560 --> 11:36.880]  We're going to look at that key information.
[11:36.880 --> 11:44.440]  Then we've got this video, DARPA is working on COVID vaccine and plantable microchip
[11:44.440 --> 11:45.680]  to detect virus.
[11:45.680 --> 11:53.920]  Now, remember last year, last February and March, we played on air probably about 500
[11:53.920 --> 11:54.920]  times.
[11:54.920 --> 11:57.640]  We played about five or six times a day.
[11:57.640 --> 12:02.960]  Rice University in Texas and MIT in Massachusetts with their directors of their nanotech saying
[12:02.960 --> 12:07.640]  we're funded by Bill and Melinda Gates to create a digital tattoo that we put on you
[12:07.640 --> 12:11.240]  that puts tiny pieces of glass into you that's on the back of a Band-Aid that works into
[12:11.240 --> 12:15.000]  your body and never comes out because the microchips are so small now.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.120]  They're grains of sand size, little pieces of glass work into you and that are part of
[12:19.120 --> 12:20.120]  your body.
[12:20.120 --> 12:23.200]  Then we can track everywhere you go and make sure you've been vaccinated and then also
[12:23.200 --> 12:28.400]  scan it and read to see what is going on with you.
[12:28.400 --> 12:32.040]  They didn't, I guess, want the local newscast out of Houston to be known or the one out
[12:32.040 --> 12:37.080]  of Massachusetts that were really internal PR things done by the university to donors.
[12:37.080 --> 12:41.000]  These were both donor films showing, oh, Bill Gates is funding us.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.560]  That's our money, we're going to implant the public with digital microchips that are on
[12:45.560 --> 12:50.920]  Band-Aid bandages and also in the shots and we showed you the patents of that.
[12:50.920 --> 12:55.680]  Now the way Snopes and others said it wasn't true is they look at one patent for the nanotech
[12:55.680 --> 13:00.800]  implantable chips in the vaccine or in a bandage and then another patent we were covering
[13:00.800 --> 13:05.800]  of blockchain where as you walk down the road, if you follow every move of the satellite
[13:05.800 --> 13:12.040]  ordering you to with a brain chip, but first it will be a phone or the nav on your car
[13:12.040 --> 13:16.400]  telling you what to do, then you will get like a video game, more bonus money from the
[13:16.400 --> 13:22.160]  blockchain from Bill Gates or from the UN and they go, oh, that's a blockchain thing.
[13:22.160 --> 13:23.440]  That's not an implantable chip.
[13:23.440 --> 13:27.000]  They would mix the two documents together when we were pointing out that they're fusing
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  it all together.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.400]  Well, we'll play this when we come back.
[13:30.400 --> 13:37.840]  Notice what happened on 60 minutes, 60 minutes came out and said, here's the little flesh
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.400]  green alien looking thing that we put in all the troops.
[13:42.400 --> 13:45.680]  We have to know if somebody's getting sick, it'll help others.
[13:45.680 --> 13:48.600]  So you must take the chip, it'll help others.
[13:48.600 --> 13:51.040]  You must wear the mask, it'll help others.
[13:51.040 --> 13:52.960]  You must social distance, it'll help others.
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.320]  You must be non-essential and go bankrupt and stay in your home to help others when it's
[13:57.320 --> 13:59.800]  all a plan to collapse things.
[13:59.800 --> 14:02.920]  When the mask don't protect you, when they give you bacterial pneumonia, doesn't matter.
[14:02.920 --> 14:05.080]  What does the Travis County judge Livingston say?
[14:05.080 --> 14:09.320]  She said, we're always going to wear the mask basically because from now on, if any virus
[14:09.320 --> 14:14.440]  flu or cold, anything can hurt you, we must all be dirty and bad forever.
[14:14.440 --> 14:17.280]  Even though all the studies show, breathing on each other gives us better immunity and
[14:17.280 --> 14:19.680]  we don't have it, we become bubble boys, it doesn't matter.
[14:19.680 --> 14:20.680]  She's got her orders.
[14:20.680 --> 14:21.680]  So now she's doing it.
[14:21.680 --> 14:22.920]  I've got her quotes right here.
[14:22.920 --> 14:25.120]  It's the same all over the country, all over the world.
[14:25.120 --> 14:33.520]  This is a fantastical rollout and we have video of the old woman sitting there in Chile
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.880]  trying to go to the grocery store and the police say, no, you don't have a travel pass.
[14:37.880 --> 14:39.440]  You don't have a cell phone.
[14:39.440 --> 14:40.680]  You don't have a QR code.
[14:40.680 --> 14:43.880]  It's already being put in there, England's rolling it out now, Spain's rolling it out
[14:43.880 --> 14:49.600]  Australia and the old lady goes away and doesn't get food because she doesn't even have a cell
[14:49.600 --> 14:50.600]  phone.
[14:50.600 --> 14:52.560]  She doesn't even know how to do it.
[14:52.560 --> 14:54.360]  This is so demonic.
[14:54.360 --> 14:55.720]  This is so evil.
[14:55.720 --> 14:56.720]  This is so wrong.
[14:56.720 --> 14:57.720]  And it's here.
[14:57.720 --> 15:01.360]  Remember all the New York Times and Washington Post, hell, Bill Gates' daughter came out
[15:01.360 --> 15:02.360]  last year.
[15:02.360 --> 15:03.960]  She's going to be a doctor herself.
[15:03.960 --> 15:05.960]  She's doing her residency.
[15:05.960 --> 15:06.960]  Grab that, guys.
[15:06.960 --> 15:11.120]  Bill Gates' daughter makes a joke and says, oh, here's the vaccine, but it doesn't have
[15:11.120 --> 15:14.440]  a microchip in it like you claim my dad wants you to have.
[15:14.440 --> 15:19.960]  Well, I'm going to show you your controller chip that tracks everywhere you go what you
[15:19.960 --> 15:24.960]  do and it's a little green thing with tentacles that goes into your body.
[15:24.960 --> 15:26.840]  It's not a science fiction movie.
[15:26.840 --> 15:30.800]  They're holding up a little vile swimming around little green creature.
[15:30.800 --> 15:33.680]  Of course, not technically, but that's what it is.
[15:33.680 --> 15:35.360]  It's a globalist tech system.
[15:35.360 --> 15:36.880]  And of course, the troops have already had a lot of these.
[15:36.880 --> 15:38.360]  They've already had brain chips put in.
[15:38.360 --> 15:39.520]  I had a family that's an officer.
[15:39.520 --> 15:42.680]  He's out of the Army now who actually got in trouble 15 years ago.
[15:42.680 --> 15:46.920]  They were in a secret briefing about chips going into the troops and a bunch of them
[15:46.920 --> 15:47.920]  got chips.
[15:47.920 --> 15:51.520]  They actually found out he told me about it and got in his face about it, but that's
[15:51.520 --> 15:52.520]  how real this is.
[15:52.520 --> 15:54.520]  And it's all about slavery and death.
[15:54.520 --> 15:55.520]  It's all about Satan.
[15:55.520 --> 15:57.080]  It's an off-world takeover.
[15:57.080 --> 16:05.400]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[16:05.400 --> 16:09.880]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[16:09.880 --> 16:13.280]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[16:13.280 --> 16:16.280]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.080]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[16:20.080 --> 16:24.800]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[16:24.800 --> 16:30.560]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the
[16:30.560 --> 16:36.800]  lowest price and 25% of your signup for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[16:36.800 --> 16:37.800]  the info war.
[16:37.800 --> 16:42.280]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get
[16:42.280 --> 16:43.280]  from them.
[16:43.280 --> 16:47.360]  And we win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are
[16:47.360 --> 16:49.680]  destroying what was open and what was free.
[16:49.680 --> 16:54.280]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[16:54.280 --> 17:23.920]  So infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[17:24.920 --> 17:27.840]  They took their sponsors away a long time ago.
[17:27.840 --> 17:30.520]  But you sponsor us by buying products direct.
[17:30.520 --> 17:34.160]  So these are already great products you need, whether it's vitamin refusion back in stock
[17:34.160 --> 17:37.920]  or whether it's winter sun or whether it's lung cleanse, they're all 40% off individually,
[17:37.920 --> 17:40.760]  50% off when you order them in combos or together.
[17:40.760 --> 17:43.760]  But regardless, it funds the info war, which is a 360 win.
[17:43.760 --> 17:46.440]  So it was a critical time in history with all those crazy things happening.
[17:46.440 --> 17:49.440]  I want to thank you all for your support and want to remind you these are products you
[17:49.440 --> 17:53.560]  and your family already need and they fund the info war, a true 360 win.
[17:53.560 --> 17:56.920]  So take advantage of these products today, find them at infowarsdomains.com.
[18:23.560 --> 18:29.560]  We saw a headline at the council on farm relations, foreign affairs, also the sister
[18:29.560 --> 18:37.480]  publication of Washington Post, public affairs, put out another article with a headline, Obama
[18:37.480 --> 18:41.920]  legalizes domestic propaganda.
[18:41.920 --> 18:42.920]  And what did that mean?
[18:42.920 --> 18:47.360]  It meant the CIA and other agencies that have been busy lying to people in foreign countries,
[18:47.360 --> 18:51.840]  publishing fake news articles, you name it, dirty tricks against our quote enemies, we're
[18:51.840 --> 18:57.440]  now doing that to us domestically.
[18:57.440 --> 19:03.800]  And if you study psychology, you learn that there's really some very dark forms of it
[19:03.800 --> 19:07.840]  where they can just ruin people's minds and totally destroy critical thinking.
[19:07.840 --> 19:11.840]  And they've got different schools of thought and different names for it, but basically
[19:11.840 --> 19:14.320]  it's like short circuiting a computer.
[19:14.320 --> 19:20.720]  And that's what you now see on the news, they'll go, there is no government plan to put chips
[19:20.720 --> 19:23.560]  in anyone and track where they go.
[19:23.560 --> 19:27.680]  That's why MIT has chips, they want to put in the troops to track where they go and
[19:27.680 --> 19:28.680]  what they do.
[19:28.680 --> 19:33.520]  Even like if I had a Uzi submachine gun, I'm out of shooting range and I go, this is
[19:33.520 --> 19:41.360]  not an Uzi submachine gun, fired it and said, see, this is not a, this is not an Uzi.
[19:41.360 --> 19:46.120]  And so a year ago, we're showing you MIT news saying Millimal Indigates Foundation funds
[19:46.120 --> 19:50.360]  it, it's public, they also fund rice.
[19:50.360 --> 19:52.720]  We've shown you the newscast over and over again.
[19:52.720 --> 19:53.720]  And what do they do?
[19:53.720 --> 19:56.960]  They censor our reports, they censor other people.
[19:56.960 --> 19:59.560]  The Corbett report needs to do a great job, I was seeing where they were taking his videos
[19:59.560 --> 20:00.640]  down about Bill Gates.
[20:00.640 --> 20:09.040]  These are Bill Gates' professors, he funds their offices, they call them chairs, whole
[20:09.040 --> 20:10.920]  programs.
[20:10.920 --> 20:15.840]  And then you show it and go, look, he's doing it, oh no, that's disinfo, that's not official
[20:15.840 --> 20:18.240]  medical info from the United Nations.
[20:18.240 --> 20:23.040]  The WHO is the only global authority on anything.
[20:23.040 --> 20:27.200]  And then Governor DeSantis has a hearing with dozens of top scientists and they lay out that
[20:27.200 --> 20:30.560]  it wasn't as bad as they said, it's the common cold and vaccines aren't going to work because
[20:30.560 --> 20:32.360]  it always mutates, which is all true.
[20:32.360 --> 20:34.800]  They go, sorry, government is a disantist.
[20:34.800 --> 20:42.080]  You can't show your hearings in the legislature because the UN says it's not true.
[20:42.080 --> 20:43.080]  Wow.
[20:43.080 --> 20:45.880]  And this isn't just censorship.
[20:45.880 --> 20:49.840]  This is a foreign governmental system doing this to us.
[20:49.840 --> 20:52.920]  And so MIT and Rice have developed three different things we know of.
[20:52.920 --> 20:55.880]  Hell, I just asked the crew to search this, they found a bunch of stuff I didn't know
[20:55.880 --> 21:00.840]  about during the break, about nanotech they're going to put in your soft drink now.
[21:00.840 --> 21:05.320]  I mean, this is a total invasion takeover.
[21:05.320 --> 21:16.480]  But then there's the psychology of this where they lie to you and say, this is not a chip
[21:16.480 --> 21:18.920]  to track you.
[21:18.920 --> 21:23.400]  It just simply tells the computer when you test your own blood, but you're going into
[21:23.400 --> 21:24.400]  a computer.
[21:24.400 --> 21:28.920]  It's a Pentagon computer and they have the troops, the left is fascinated with military
[21:28.920 --> 21:33.080]  because they can make them do whatever they want, they think.
[21:33.080 --> 21:37.880]  And of course, you now know in LA and Orange County schools, they're offering young children
[21:37.880 --> 21:39.680]  vaccines that their parents can send.
[21:39.680 --> 21:42.240]  They're even admitting it in hearings they're having.
[21:42.240 --> 21:46.320]  Do you realize how illegal that is?
[21:46.320 --> 21:47.320]  And that's the thing.
[21:47.320 --> 21:51.640]  They're having a whole system commit crime, claiming they have the high ground as a revolution
[21:51.640 --> 21:52.640]  to overwhelm us.
[21:52.640 --> 21:54.880]  So overhead shot, please.
[21:54.880 --> 22:02.040]  Here's media matters memorializing this from last March, Alex Jones unhinged conspiracy
[22:02.040 --> 22:04.800]  theories about Bill Gates and the coronavirus.
[22:04.800 --> 22:13.040]  And it goes on to say Jones claims Gates is funding implantable microchips to track your
[22:13.040 --> 22:19.480]  vaccination or to track COVID.
[22:19.480 --> 22:21.240]  Also say he's a supervillain behind a death cult.
[22:21.240 --> 22:23.480]  I mean, what is he?
[22:23.480 --> 22:25.680]  World shock by Bill Gates blueprint for collapse.
[22:25.680 --> 22:29.600]  I mean, this is all real.
[22:29.600 --> 22:33.520]  Bill Gates and Fauci do about coronavirus for years and prepared to make themselves rich
[22:33.520 --> 22:37.240]  and powerful.
[22:37.240 --> 22:40.040]  Bill Gates had mentioned the population plan to make coronavirus outbreak.
[22:40.040 --> 22:41.400]  And this is all real stuff.
[22:41.400 --> 22:42.400]  They just don't link to it.
[22:42.400 --> 22:43.400]  You can see it.
[22:43.400 --> 22:44.920]  They just say it's not true.
[22:44.920 --> 22:46.920]  So I'm a liar, folks.
[22:46.920 --> 22:52.400]  Oh, look, storing medical information below the skin surface, MIT news.
[22:52.400 --> 22:56.120]  Bill Gates funding in 2019 just showed you the quote on screen.
[22:56.120 --> 22:59.120]  Invisible link tattoos to be used.
[22:59.120 --> 23:07.480]  Now let's move on to the big story, time for wars.com to Paul Joseph Watson story.
[23:07.480 --> 23:10.280]  And it's 60 minutes.
[23:10.280 --> 23:16.600]  Now this isn't some government thing to track you know, it's just the Pentagon and it's
[23:16.600 --> 23:25.720]  in a little sealed test tube and it's little green things with tentacles, little nano tech
[23:25.720 --> 23:32.680]  that plugs into your nerves and then transmits to a smartphone or other computer.
[23:32.680 --> 23:36.720]  Oh, there's nothing wrong there.
[23:36.720 --> 23:39.560]  And they do the gaslighting.
[23:39.560 --> 23:44.120]  Famous gaslighting is you start slapping a woman and you say no one's slapping you and
[23:44.120 --> 23:45.360]  you call like 10 other men in the room.
[23:45.360 --> 23:47.320]  They go, no one's slapping you, no one's slapping you.
[23:47.320 --> 23:50.440]  And women particularly, if you keep slapping them for about an hour, they will start believing
[23:50.440 --> 23:51.680]  that they're not being slapped.
[23:51.680 --> 23:54.360]  It's called Stockholm syndrome.
[23:54.360 --> 23:56.000]  I'm not being mean to women.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  I'm not putting you down.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  It's just you're the main target.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.800]  You see how women are submitting so much, but so do men as well.
[24:01.800 --> 24:04.960]  But they estimate 10 to 1 when we're going to take these chips above men.
[24:04.960 --> 24:06.680]  Oh, it's how you work as a community.
[24:06.680 --> 24:08.080]  It's how you're good.
[24:08.080 --> 24:10.760]  And now everybody's buying with the chip.
[24:10.760 --> 24:15.120]  Well, now these new chips just go into your bloodstream and you never can get them out.
[24:15.120 --> 24:16.120]  Comprende?
[24:16.120 --> 24:18.640]  I was like, I'll just dig that microchip out if they make me have it.
[24:18.640 --> 24:20.360]  They're going to inject it into your tissue.
[24:20.360 --> 24:22.360]  It's the mark.
[24:22.360 --> 24:24.560]  Their genetic mark on you.
[24:24.560 --> 24:30.800]  The Pfizer one alone has jellyfish genes, a dead baby from 1976 in it.
[24:30.800 --> 24:32.440]  All this other weird stuff.
[24:32.440 --> 24:33.960]  And scientists ask, what's this for?
[24:33.960 --> 24:34.960]  They go, oh, it's experimental.
[24:34.960 --> 24:35.960]  You're not allowed to ask.
[24:35.960 --> 24:41.720]  And then on the news, though, it's like safe and effective, highly tested and totally safe.
[24:41.720 --> 24:43.560]  I saw it in the Austin Chronicle last week's edition.
[24:43.560 --> 24:44.960]  It's actually in my office.
[24:44.960 --> 24:45.960]  My door is open.
[24:45.960 --> 24:50.320]  Somebody will go grab me the Chronicle off my desk, the local communist paper.
[24:50.320 --> 24:54.960]  And it shows them handing out to black people a sheet saying, COVID vaccine's totally safe
[24:54.960 --> 24:55.960]  and effective.
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.120]  They come to the door and they go, I brought you a couple cans of baked beans because you're
[25:00.120 --> 25:02.240]  black and I'm a white savior.
[25:02.240 --> 25:03.240]  Will you please take it?
[25:03.240 --> 25:04.240]  I love you so much.
[25:04.240 --> 25:05.240]  I'm so liberal.
[25:05.240 --> 25:10.440]  And of course, the idiot coming to your door just wants the virtual signal, but they're
[25:10.440 --> 25:14.320]  part of something big and evil.
[25:14.320 --> 25:17.320]  So let's go ahead and play part of the 60 minutes piece.
[25:17.320 --> 25:20.760]  Start at 60 minutes to save you from COVID, the microchip.
[25:20.760 --> 25:24.600]  Dr. Hepburn showed us a few current projects.
[25:24.600 --> 25:28.080]  Some sound like they're from an episode of Star Trek.
[25:28.080 --> 25:35.000]  Consider a ship like the USS Theodore Roosevelt hobbled last year when 1271 crew members tested
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.520]  positive for the coronavirus.
[25:37.520 --> 25:43.040]  What if everyone on board had their health monitored with this sub dermal implant now
[25:43.040 --> 25:45.320]  in late stage testing?
[25:45.320 --> 25:51.000]  It's not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue like
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.040]  gel engineered to continuously test your blood.
[25:55.040 --> 25:56.520]  It's a sensor.
[25:56.520 --> 25:58.240]  This tiny green thing in there?
[25:58.240 --> 26:00.040]  That tiny green thing in there.
[26:00.040 --> 26:05.760]  You put it underneath your skin and what that tells you is that there are chemical reactions
[26:05.760 --> 26:11.960]  going on inside the body and that signal means you're going to have symptoms tomorrow.
[26:11.960 --> 26:12.960]  Wow.
[26:12.960 --> 26:15.360]  So there's an actual transmitter in that?
[26:15.360 --> 26:17.240]  Yeah, it's like a check engine like.
[26:17.240 --> 26:20.600]  Check this sailor out before he infects other people.
[26:20.600 --> 26:21.880]  That's right.
[26:21.880 --> 26:26.960]  Sailors would get the signal then self-administer a blood draw and test themselves on site.
[26:26.960 --> 26:28.240]  Look at that.
[26:28.240 --> 26:31.280]  We can have that information in three to five minutes.
[26:31.280 --> 26:37.280]  As you truncate that time, as you diagnose and treat, what you do is you stop the infection
[26:37.280 --> 26:39.760]  in its tracks.
[26:39.760 --> 26:44.600]  Just unpack the fallacies, the lies, the fraud, the deception in just that short clip.
[26:44.600 --> 26:45.600]  It gets even worse.
[26:45.600 --> 26:48.080]  And of course, Bill Gates is directly funding that project.
[26:48.080 --> 26:49.080]  Oh, but he isn't.
[26:49.080 --> 26:50.080]  The ADL will say you're a Nazi.
[26:50.080 --> 26:51.080]  You'll be trying to stop it.
[26:51.080 --> 26:53.080]  You don't want to take microchips to track you.
[26:53.080 --> 26:54.080]  You're a Nazi.
[26:54.080 --> 26:55.080]  The ADL said so.
[26:55.080 --> 27:03.680]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[27:03.680 --> 27:09.920]  Now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[27:09.920 --> 27:13.360]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.360]  They will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue.
[27:18.360 --> 27:23.880]  It is the Patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[27:23.880 --> 27:30.560]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[27:30.560 --> 27:36.680]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance
[27:36.680 --> 27:43.240]  to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation for purpose
[27:43.240 --> 27:49.880]  of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[27:49.880 --> 27:57.040]  So help me, God.
[27:57.040 --> 28:01.440]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[28:01.440 --> 28:06.000]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.240]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune
[28:11.240 --> 28:12.240]  system.

[31:00.400 --> 31:17.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:17.840 --> 31:20.160]  This is the broadcast the enemy is trying to jam.
[31:20.160 --> 31:22.160]  This is the broadcast that's pro-human.
[31:22.160 --> 31:23.160]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[31:23.160 --> 31:24.160]  Thank you for joining us.
[31:24.160 --> 31:31.520]  Now next hour, I'm going to get into the Chauvin show trial taking place in Minneapolis,
[31:31.520 --> 31:41.680]  and the giant riots there and the looting of pizza places, foot lockers, liquor stores.
[31:41.680 --> 31:45.600]  You name it, there's nothing to do with the wrongful death of a man that had more fentanyl
[31:45.600 --> 31:49.280]  in his body than even two people could survive.
[31:49.280 --> 31:50.560]  It's clear the officer knew him.
[31:50.560 --> 31:52.320]  The clear the officer was not trying to kill him.
[31:52.320 --> 31:53.320]  It looks really bad.
[31:53.320 --> 31:55.240]  You've already crossed that bridge.
[31:55.240 --> 32:00.160]  The media is hyping this to cause giant race riots around the country to further destabilize
[32:00.160 --> 32:01.160]  it.
[32:01.160 --> 32:07.920]  And just the trial itself has caused anti-white riots in Minneapolis and in areas of California.
[32:07.920 --> 32:16.720]  There's incredible footage on InfoWars of whites just being shot at, stabbed, beat up,
[32:16.720 --> 32:22.720]  and there's so much black on white crime now, and the media is 100% selling it like it's
[32:22.720 --> 32:23.720]  good.
[32:23.720 --> 32:27.560]  Target sells a book talking about the wonders of going after attacking white people and they
[32:27.560 --> 32:34.080]  put out all these movies about how whites are inherently evil, and the evil ADL in Southern
[32:34.080 --> 32:39.080]  Probably Law Center says nothing about any of it.
[32:39.080 --> 32:44.880]  They are creating total division in this country to divide and conquer us, and it's social
[32:44.880 --> 32:47.000]  engineering and it's out of control.
[32:47.000 --> 32:51.920]  I'm going to cover all that next hour, but we have to understand that this is being done
[32:51.920 --> 32:54.400]  because they're targeting all of humanity.
[32:54.400 --> 32:55.400]  They're poisoning us.
[32:55.400 --> 33:00.440]  They're dumbing us down, and that they're going after every one of these poisoned vaccines
[33:00.440 --> 33:06.880]  with these gene therapy manipulation systems, and that's why they're launching this destabilization
[33:06.880 --> 33:10.520]  over here while they're really attacking and killing us over there.
[33:10.520 --> 33:17.640]  But that doesn't mean that if you are a white person in a liberal blue city that you can
[33:17.640 --> 33:23.120]  walk down a predominant black neighborhood, you will get attacked if you do it four or
[33:23.120 --> 33:24.520]  five times.
[33:24.520 --> 33:27.480]  You'll get shaken down bare minimum.
[33:27.480 --> 33:31.200]  I'm a pretty big guy and I don't look like a pushover.
[33:31.200 --> 33:33.800]  I cannot go to most areas of East Austin now.
[33:33.800 --> 33:38.080]  Black people will approach me and demand money and threaten to physically attack, and I have
[33:38.080 --> 33:40.360]  a lot of family and stuff that's happening to them.
[33:40.360 --> 33:41.840]  I have family that's Asian.
[33:41.840 --> 33:46.720]  It happens to them, and it's very, very sad, and I'm not manipulated.
[33:46.720 --> 33:49.120]  I know that most black folks aren't like that.
[33:49.120 --> 33:52.600]  I understand that the media is pushing it and doing it, and I understand that CNN and
[33:52.600 --> 33:59.400]  people like that are doing it, and it still doesn't mean, though, that you should be naive
[33:59.400 --> 34:00.400]  about what's going to happen.
[34:00.400 --> 34:03.760]  I mean, I see articles every day about 11-year-old girl was walking through the predominantly
[34:03.760 --> 34:09.760]  black neighborhood and was shot five times in the back because she's white, and you
[34:09.760 --> 34:14.240]  see the left, you're going, oh, poor, poor white people, and white people are just being
[34:14.240 --> 34:16.240]  totally preyed upon.
[34:16.240 --> 34:17.240]  Same thing in Europe.
[34:17.240 --> 34:22.600]  The Islamists are preying on folks, and the Islamists get away with it so much.
[34:22.600 --> 34:27.040]  You saw the famous deal where the black rappers are in, was it France, and they start trying
[34:27.040 --> 34:30.360]  to shake down the black rappers, and they beat up the Muslims, and then they got arrested.
[34:30.360 --> 34:35.400]  It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, Muslims trump blacks in the globalist order, so it's
[34:35.400 --> 34:39.560]  open season on whites, and then if you're a Muslim, it's open season on anybody you
[34:39.560 --> 34:40.560]  want.
[34:40.560 --> 34:45.240]  So we're going to cover that next hour, but I just want people to understand the backdrop
[34:45.240 --> 34:52.280]  of the fact that the globalists are literally starving Africa and other areas to death while
[34:52.280 --> 34:56.680]  teaching us all to hate each other and kill each other here, and it's a very diabolical
[34:56.680 --> 35:01.600]  sick, sick plan, and I can tell you, most of the black folks I know are horrified by
[35:01.600 --> 35:06.800]  it and absolutely see through it, but the young people, whether they be black or white,
[35:06.800 --> 35:13.600]  on average, are extremely dumbed down and extremely into the media and really believing
[35:13.600 --> 35:15.760]  what's going on.
[35:15.760 --> 35:20.560]  I have family that believes there's an epidemic of violence by police against blacks, even
[35:20.560 --> 35:25.080]  though about 12 to 14 black males die a year in questionable circumstances to hand the
[35:25.080 --> 35:26.080]  police.
[35:26.080 --> 35:29.880]  In total, it's less than 200 black males are killed a year by the police, thousands and
[35:29.880 --> 35:34.760]  thousands of black males are killed by other black males, and my point is, we're all taught
[35:34.760 --> 35:39.080]  to freak out when you see the cops do something wrong to a black person, and that is simply
[35:39.080 --> 35:42.600]  because the left wants to take over the local police departments and bully them every time
[35:42.600 --> 35:43.600]  there's an event.
[35:43.600 --> 35:44.600]  It's about power.
[35:44.600 --> 35:48.120]  Soros has bought off most of the district attorneys, he's put most of the DA's in, he
[35:48.120 --> 35:52.000]  has a lot of the state attorney generals, and he's a globalist, and this is just about
[35:52.000 --> 36:00.040]  getting the police to bow down to his organization, BLM, whose owners and controllers have made
[36:00.040 --> 36:04.640]  $10.6 billion, $10.6 billion last year.
[36:04.640 --> 36:07.640]  That's why, oh, look, this black lady that says whites are evil and should be gotten
[36:07.640 --> 36:11.800]  rid of, and that communism's the way, and that all black men should basically be sterilized
[36:11.800 --> 36:17.440]  because it's so trendy to make them transsexual, and the nuclear family's bad, she doesn't
[36:17.440 --> 36:20.880]  just own one million and a half dollar house, they found four more, one of them is like
[36:20.880 --> 36:28.360]  $8 million with helicopter pads and jet hangers full of jet airplanes, okay?
[36:28.360 --> 36:32.040]  And now they're calling for an investigation, the other members, so they all look safe.
[36:32.040 --> 36:34.720]  This is all a scam.
[36:34.720 --> 36:37.960]  You're not the resistance when you're in Black Lives Matter, you're working for the most
[36:37.960 --> 36:46.280]  evil globalist on Earth, so that's all this is, and then, believe me, once they get control
[36:46.280 --> 36:50.280]  of the police, then they're going to be death squads, they're going to be left as police
[36:50.280 --> 36:54.280]  like Venezuela or Cuba or North Korea, and then there won't be any news coverage, it's
[36:54.280 --> 36:58.160]  like when the police, you'll see white cops beat up a black guy with billy clubs who's
[36:58.160 --> 37:02.560]  not wearing a mask, and people are like, that's good, he needs it for no reason, or black
[37:02.560 --> 37:07.440]  cops beat up black people, black women, white women that matter, and they're like, oh, good
[37:07.440 --> 37:12.800]  enough, but then, oh my gosh, something goes wrong, somewhere else, let's just burn down
[37:12.800 --> 37:17.160]  the whole country, let's show the cops, let's show them, because they're local governments,
[37:17.160 --> 37:20.360]  and they're easy to take over, and the left's taking them over, I'm going to cover all that
[37:20.360 --> 37:27.400]  with all the videos next hour, it is, it is insane, but I want, at the next segment,
[37:27.400 --> 37:31.880]  to show you the Austin Chronicle I've got right here, where it talks about how they're
[37:31.880 --> 37:36.280]  doing all this great work, and they come to the black people's doors and tell them, please
[37:36.280 --> 37:42.320]  take their shots, the white savers do, and so, we're going to be laying out the latest
[37:42.320 --> 37:48.520]  developments, where now, under the new global vaccine passports that G.G.
[37:48.520 --> 37:51.920]  Ping runs through the U.N., it's all official, told you about it a year ago, he's proposing
[37:51.920 --> 37:56.400]  it, you can't go to the grocery store unless you have it, and then it's going to tell you
[37:56.400 --> 38:01.480]  when you're allowed to go, oh, once you agree to these, now there's only certain times you
[38:01.480 --> 38:06.640]  can go out, certain times you can get food, and it creates a record of what you buy,
[38:06.640 --> 38:10.200]  because we're in a communal system now, so if you eat the wrong things, you're going
[38:10.200 --> 38:17.080]  to be punished, it's all being announced, and then we have the footage of the old woman
[38:17.080 --> 38:22.520]  in Chile, and they said, sorry, you don't have a travel pass on your phone, you're not
[38:22.520 --> 38:29.480]  allowed to have food, and they, oh, it's so fun, it's so good, and so we're going to be
[38:29.480 --> 38:35.160]  covering all of that coming up next segment, separately.
[38:35.160 --> 38:39.840]  I got 20,000 of these in, people are really wanting to buy in-game, I noticed the copies
[38:39.840 --> 38:45.280]  we had sort of selling really fast, so I ordered 20,000 of them, we're selling one for $14.95,
[38:45.280 --> 38:51.120]  you can get 10 of them for $3 a piece, you can get five of them for $5 in change, and

[40:07.000 --> 40:11.400]  He predicts everything that happened, and we show who runs it, who controls it, we just
[40:11.400 --> 40:17.600]  got 20,000 of these in, and we need people to get them to share them, they make great
[40:17.600 --> 40:20.840]  gifts as well, you can buy them early and they know that you already got your Christmas

[41:55.400 --> 41:59.360]  Again, I don't like to lecture people, I'm a very private person, but because of the
[41:59.360 --> 42:03.400]  globalists, they're attacking humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public
[42:03.400 --> 42:08.640]  figure, and we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God,
[42:08.640 --> 42:12.120]  and I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me
[42:12.120 --> 42:16.040]  a break, the Satanism's out in the open, and I've always been a Christian, but now the
[42:16.040 --> 42:19.880]  fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear, and I get it, a lot of you've
[42:19.880 --> 42:24.560]  been turned off by big churches, a lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest
[42:24.560 --> 42:29.400]  class system, and I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them, but it's that relationship
[42:29.400 --> 42:35.760]  with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential, and God created
[42:35.760 --> 42:40.080]  the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life, and so that's
[42:40.080 --> 42:43.720]  what M-Full Wars is really all about, so thank you all for your word of mouth, thank
[42:43.720 --> 42:46.960]  you for spreading the word about M-Full Wars, and thank you for supporting us to keep us

[42:56.720 --> 43:01.360]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world, they are creating insecurity, crime,
[43:01.360 --> 43:03.000]  war, and famine.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.600]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and

[43:57.240 --> 44:05.200]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association,
[44:05.200 --> 44:09.680]  and they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[44:09.680 --> 44:14.280]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering, that's why they've been massively
[44:14.280 --> 44:16.080]  expanding their services.
[44:16.080 --> 44:19.880]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[44:19.880 --> 44:24.760]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding, and if you
[44:24.760 --> 44:30.760]  go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the lowest
[44:30.760 --> 44:37.000]  price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.080]  war and then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get
[44:42.080 --> 44:46.640]  from them, so it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again, because the
[44:46.640 --> 44:49.520]  globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[44:49.520 --> 45:00.400]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there, infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[45:00.400 --> 45:07.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:07.400 --> 45:26.760]  All right, if you just joined us earlier, I played a clip off of 60 Minutes last night,
[45:26.760 --> 45:33.280]  60 Minutes Sunday, going oh look Jarpa and a lab funded by Bill Gates has come up with
[45:33.280 --> 45:42.840]  these little green octopus looking flesh like antenna systems that are implanted in your
[45:42.840 --> 45:48.800]  body and they're basically absorbed into your body, but it's not tracking you even
[45:48.800 --> 45:51.320]  though it does track you.
[45:51.320 --> 45:57.320]  Now why is this so important, because it's how they define the things, they go it's not
[45:57.320 --> 46:04.800]  a microchip, it's a green flesh like system that tracks you, just like the new microchips
[46:04.800 --> 46:09.920]  are glass on a bandage that work into your skin and into your body, you can't get rid
[46:09.920 --> 46:14.840]  of them, they just keep working in, or it's inside the injector and nano tech in your
[46:14.840 --> 46:23.520]  body, that's where the microchips have been for decades, but here's what's bigger, you've
[46:23.520 --> 46:27.440]  all been taught to be scared of a little classic rice size primitive chip that they've had
[46:27.440 --> 46:35.160]  for 50 years, 60 years, now they're like oh this isn't a chip, it doesn't track you, it's
[46:35.160 --> 46:40.800]  a little green thing that tracks you and so they just play that mind game, it's not the
[46:40.800 --> 46:51.040]  dreaded chip, it's a little green octopus, but understand this, that's even old technology
[46:51.040 --> 46:57.680]  and they say oh the chip was crippled by COVID, no one died on that chip, the PCR tester fake,
[46:57.680 --> 47:03.920]  they had a cold virus on a chip and they use it to say they were crippled, so there's
[47:03.920 --> 47:09.160]  a crisis so you all need chips and China they just say you're super soldiers, we're injecting
[47:09.160 --> 47:14.240]  you with mRNA to make you have more stamina and bigger muscles, it has horrible side effects
[47:14.240 --> 47:18.280]  but okay, remember the headlines, I told you about it decades ago but now it's in the news
[47:18.280 --> 47:24.560]  this year, China is doing secret mRNA with vaccines to make their soldiers smarter, faster
[47:24.560 --> 47:31.880]  and stronger, they're really just testing on them and then they just glamorize it and
[47:31.880 --> 47:35.200]  all the other countries couldn't get this approved, not India, not the US, not Russia
[47:35.200 --> 47:40.800]  so now they use COVID to do it, you see, so what is the Johnson and Johnson vaccine,
[47:40.800 --> 47:49.000]  what is the AstraZeneca, what is the Pfizer, they're all mRNA because the two of them fire
[47:49.000 --> 47:55.480]  a virus with another virus inside of it into your DNA, that's the Pfizer, that's the Johnson
[47:55.480 --> 48:01.200]  and Johnson and AstraZeneca, their new virus vector vaccines that are super dangerous,
[48:01.200 --> 48:04.480]  that were always known as experimental, only tested on the US military because they were
[48:04.480 --> 48:09.080]  guinea pigs, still wrong and then you've got the mRNA that just programs from the outside
[48:09.080 --> 48:16.400]  of the cell to the ribosomes, still the same thing and so this is all illegal but they
[48:16.400 --> 48:20.560]  go oh we got a problem on a ship, the answer is this, it's not the dreaded ship, does it
[48:20.560 --> 48:24.200]  track you, it just tracks you and tells the computer when you should blood test yourself
[48:24.200 --> 48:30.760]  and then you administer the test on yourself like you're a guinea pig, has nothing to do
[48:30.760 --> 48:35.240]  with that, it's a tracker because it tells the system when you need to be checked, it's
[48:35.240 --> 48:41.120]  tracking where you're at, it's monitoring your blood but it's not a tracker, this is
[48:41.120 --> 48:46.160]  so authoritarian, it's so deceptive and all these top scientists including the former
[48:46.160 --> 48:51.200]  chief scientist at Pfizer, he said everything they say from the epidemiology is a lie, it's
[48:51.200 --> 48:55.560]  a 180, I talked to all the other virologists I know, they go yeah it's all lies but none
[48:55.560 --> 49:00.240]  of them can speak out because they get banned or fired, so on top of it all being a lie
[49:00.240 --> 49:06.600]  you get censored or fired if you talk about it, more authoritarianism and now they're
[49:06.600 --> 49:13.520]  doing it to children without informed consent, you know all the ferrets died that took the
[49:13.520 --> 49:18.200]  mRNA vaccine four years ago when they tested this exact thing, you know they already tested
[49:18.200 --> 49:24.840]  on animals, they skipped trials because it kills so many of them, now humans are tougher
[49:24.840 --> 49:28.560]  than dogs and cats and rats, it's known, there's something special about us for those
[49:28.560 --> 49:32.160]  that don't know that globalists know and it varies from human to human but a lot of people
[49:32.160 --> 49:36.760]  can take a lot of poison, especially white people, little secret they know, you can say
[49:36.760 --> 49:40.840]  we're like cloned with something who knows, the point is, is that black people cannot
[49:40.840 --> 49:46.680]  take a lot of poison, fluoride has twice as bad an effect on a black male as a Caucasian
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.040]  male and it just goes on from there, so we're all human but we're all different, we all
[49:51.040 --> 49:56.520]  know that and so these globalists know what they're doing and the evidence is showing
[49:56.520 --> 50:02.640]  these vaccines hurt blacks even worse than whites and hurt men more than women, then
[50:02.640 --> 50:04.920]  they try to spin it and go well actually it's hurting women more because they're getting
[50:04.920 --> 50:10.320]  these tumors all over them, the point is they're not going to launch something like this and
[50:10.320 --> 50:13.960]  then not launch something bigger to cover up what happened here, they're going for
[50:13.960 --> 50:20.480]  broke and so like even Ron Paul came out and said this is a desperate situation, we've
[50:20.480 --> 50:24.120]  got to stop the vaccine passports, we've got to kill it right now, you've got to get
[50:24.120 --> 50:27.800]  aggressive with the mass cult, you've got to get aggressive with your city councils
[50:27.800 --> 50:32.000]  and these county judges, you've got to explain to them what's really going on now before
[50:32.000 --> 50:40.080]  it's too late because the AstraZeneca, the Pfizer, the Moderna, all of these are not
[50:40.080 --> 50:43.400]  vaccines where you put a dead bacteria or a virus on somebody and your body learns
[50:43.400 --> 50:52.040]  how to beat it, like training an attack dog on a dummy, these are gene editing nanotech
[50:52.040 --> 50:58.840]  lab created synthetic nanotech, so you're worried about a little implantable chip or
[50:58.840 --> 51:07.960]  a little thing that looks like a blue sea creature or a green octopus with antennas
[51:07.960 --> 51:12.440]  on it, those are some of the matrix where he drops the shrimp down his mouth, you know
[51:12.440 --> 51:17.240]  it tracks him, that's exactly what all this is, they're throwing it in your face, they're
[51:17.240 --> 51:21.800]  mimicking life with what they're doing, they're infecting us but it's already in these shots
[51:21.800 --> 51:28.800]  that they want to mutate to discover the Lazarus gene in us or the immortal cell line in their
[51:28.800 --> 51:31.080]  own words, how do I know this?
[51:31.080 --> 51:38.040]  They are mass testing on everybody to then see who can survive this, they've already
[51:38.040 --> 51:42.360]  committed a massive crime, millions are already dying from the vaccines, they're now attributing
[51:42.360 --> 51:46.080]  it to COVID, there's mass mental illness with those getting injected, just like the John
[51:46.080 --> 51:52.320]  Hopkins prediction, the Spars 2025, 2028 predicted, it's all a nightmare scenario, it's moving
[51:52.320 --> 51:56.080]  quicker than I even thought, I was wrong, it's worse than I thought, I thought they
[51:56.080 --> 52:00.560]  would beta test and space it out, but because they were behind, because they were in trouble,
[52:00.560 --> 52:05.280]  because of the global awakening, they are now accelerating this, so here's what I'm
[52:05.280 --> 52:09.120]  going to do, I'm behind again, I'm going to come back, I'm going to put this 60 minutes
[52:09.120 --> 52:12.720]  piece again, I'm going to slowly stop it and start it and analyze it, and then I'm going
[52:12.720 --> 52:17.080]  to show you the rest of this news, but in their own words, they're going to lock you
[52:17.080 --> 52:21.040]  down forever with this, they're teaching you you're non-essential, and when you get the
[52:21.040 --> 52:24.880]  COVID shots, they tell you it still doesn't work, there's too many variants, you can't
[52:24.880 --> 52:28.360]  get 10 shots a year and have freedom, it's a trap, you never get out of it, they've
[52:28.360 --> 52:33.360]  admitted all that, people think oh I just go get this shot and then I go back to life,
[52:33.360 --> 52:40.120]  no, you are captured, only getting out of the jail cell frees you, and again they put
[52:40.120 --> 52:44.640]  you on lock down for six months, let you out, limited, wear your mask, you can go certain
[52:44.640 --> 52:49.400]  places, it's like letting a trustee who's been in prison for years, you know, go to
[52:49.400 --> 52:53.800]  the store and pick up some stuff because he's a well behaved slave, this is all prisoner
[52:53.800 --> 52:59.920]  training period, look at the local chronicle, Dr. McCamshaw please, it says look, oh, it
[52:59.920 --> 53:04.960]  says that liberal volunteers are going to disadvantage east Austin neighborhoods and
[53:04.960 --> 53:11.960]  giving them care packages of masks and little cans of food and things, and this big brochure
[53:11.960 --> 53:21.400]  saying COVID vaccines are safe, COVID vaccines are tested and 100% effective, that's a criminal
[53:21.400 --> 53:27.720]  lie, they're experimental, it's out of control, and that's the facts, so I'm going to go
[53:27.720 --> 53:32.800]  over all this when we come back, but the future is you only buy and sell when they say if
[53:32.800 --> 53:37.600]  they want to keep you around, and you're going to have to go to social training systems,
[53:37.600 --> 53:40.920]  literally programmed by the Southern Primary Law Center in the ADL, and if you don't do
[53:40.920 --> 53:46.360]  it you'll be in anti-Semite, so that's how they've tasked all this, it's how they've
[53:46.360 --> 53:51.880]  scripted it, it's how they've prepared the whole deal, it is a nightmare dystopia, we
[53:51.880 --> 53:55.800]  better understand that big tech is the arm of the big banks and the globalist, and what
[53:55.800 --> 53:59.440]  they do with the censorship and the death camps they help run everything is what they
[53:59.440 --> 54:05.320]  want for us, and that all the long hair and all the hippie talk is a cover for very savage
[54:05.320 --> 54:11.480]  evil people, all the pink sweaters that Oprah and Bill Gates and Ted Turner and every interview
[54:11.480 --> 54:14.960]  now they were pink sweaters, and they even admit the psychology behind that should look
[54:14.960 --> 54:18.680]  non-threatening, because they were wearing a freaking field marshal outfit, you'd go
[54:18.680 --> 54:25.280]  that's Hitler, and so this is all scientific, just like when a guy pulls up at your house
[54:25.280 --> 54:28.480]  with an ice cream truck going I got a puppy trying to get your four-year-old you weren't
[54:28.480 --> 54:32.480]  watching in the car with him, they don't pull up in a thing with fire coming out in a big
[54:32.480 --> 54:39.520]  demon face with a sound of ghosts going whoo, because your kid would run inside, a creeper
[54:39.520 --> 54:44.160]  doesn't pull up in a van and then have the sounds of wildcats roaring in the background,
[54:44.160 --> 54:49.680]  your kid would run in, but they come up going oh hi how you doing, I got a lollipop right
[54:49.680 --> 54:54.320]  here, I got an ice cream cone, yeah come around the back of the van, you want to see
[54:54.320 --> 55:02.520]  the puppy, and that's all this is folks, these are murdering predators and all these cowards
[55:02.520 --> 55:06.200]  that have said yes to the system so long, they subconsciously know it's real, they're
[55:06.200 --> 55:14.200]  scared, so they decided to join with it and go along with it, and so again I tried to
[55:14.200 --> 55:17.480]  deny this in my own head and said well they're doing a beta test, they're going to launch
[55:17.480 --> 55:22.800]  a bigger one later, and on the scale it will be much bigger, but they're not going to space
[55:22.800 --> 55:28.640]  this out even 5 or 10 years, this is, we never go back and everybody is dead basically, I
[55:28.640 --> 55:34.360]  mean you watch, it's hell has been released, the Antichrist will appear soon, notice none
[55:34.360 --> 55:37.360]  of the churches are saying a word, they're all saying do the Chiora code to go to church,
[55:37.360 --> 55:40.640]  they're going to tell you take the ship, you're going to hell, they're going to bow down before
[55:40.640 --> 55:43.960]  the Antichrist, you're going to see everything, you're going to see hell on earth, we'll
[55:43.960 --> 55:45.960]  be right back.
[55:45.960 --> 55:51.920]  I'm going to say it again, I am not lecturing you, I'm lecturing myself, I need to take
[55:51.920 --> 55:56.840]  vitamin mineral fusion every day, it tastes great, it's all natural, it's got all the

[56:47.080 --> 56:52.440]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something,
[56:52.440 --> 56:56.800]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew, that has come together over
[56:56.800 --> 57:01.120]  the years, and has truly answered a prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[57:01.120 --> 57:05.120]  you, the listeners of this show, I want you to know that I love you, and I appreciate you,
[57:05.120 --> 57:08.760]  whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you've got
[57:08.760 --> 57:13.560]  red blood, and if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we
[57:13.560 --> 57:18.560]  are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to
[57:18.560 --> 57:22.640]  work with you over the years, and as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under
[57:22.640 --> 57:28.600]  the future, but again, that's really up to you and up to God, so please, I hope God works
[57:28.600 --> 57:33.320]  through you, and puts a message in your heart to support us, but again, that's up to you
[57:33.320 --> 57:37.000]  and your relationship with God, I just want to thank you all for the years of support
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.920]  you've given us and what you've done, and just ask you again to pray to God and ask
[57:40.920 --> 57:45.160]  what God's vision is for you, and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support
[57:45.160 --> 57:50.360]  Him for worse, God bless.
[57:50.360 --> 58:05.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:05.360 --> 58:10.040]  All right, there is a video that's about 10 minutes long, it's a Band-Aid video, and last
[58:10.040 --> 58:14.120]  time I checked it, it's about 300,000 views, that's great, but it's about 300 million views.
[58:14.120 --> 58:18.440]  It's Bill Gates in his own words talking about the depopulation program.
[58:18.440 --> 58:23.000]  Watch Bill Gates admit the human depopulation program, nine minutes, 28 seconds Band-Aid
[58:23.000 --> 58:24.000]  video.
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.200]  I'm going to play a few minutes of this, so some stations don't to carry this segment,
[58:27.200 --> 58:29.960]  and then I'm going to come back and be as judicious as possible to actually plow through
[58:29.960 --> 58:34.560]  the COVID takeover news, and how to counter it, and of course, the announcement for implausible
[58:34.560 --> 58:39.360]  microchips in U.S. troops, again, there were a lot of articles about them testing chips
[58:39.360 --> 58:45.000]  on troops 20 years ago, then I confirmed from family that they were briefed in a group
[58:45.000 --> 58:50.360]  of several hundred officers in the Army here in Texas at a base.
[58:50.360 --> 58:53.480]  My cousin told me I could talk about it, just don't say his name, but they figured it out
[58:53.480 --> 58:58.560]  and called him in about it, he's retired now, but that's how serious it is, and so a lot
[58:58.560 --> 59:01.240]  of folks have already gotten chips, they've already been tested on, they say do it for
[59:01.240 --> 59:06.360]  your country, it's well known, a lot of people volunteer for things like MK Ultra 50, 60 years
[59:06.360 --> 59:08.240]  ago, so that goes on.
[59:08.240 --> 59:11.560]  There's DARPA's testing in plattable chips in soldiers' brains.
[59:11.560 --> 59:16.040]  I would tell people this 15 years ago, they'd say you're crazy, but now it's all out of
[59:16.040 --> 59:20.240]  the open, but let's go ahead and go to part of Bill Gates.
[59:20.240 --> 59:27.800]  The issue that really grabbed me as urgent were issues related to population.
[59:27.800 --> 59:33.800]  In 1998, Dr. Zaven became the founding director of the Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for
[59:33.800 --> 59:34.800]  Population Control.
[59:34.800 --> 59:47.480]  We see a lot of things that are going very well, things like producing child to death
[59:47.480 --> 59:55.880]  and things like producing child to death and first we've got population.
[59:55.880 --> 1:00:00.880]  The world today has 6.8 billion people, that's headed up to about 9 billion.
[1:00:00.880 --> 1:00:07.400]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services,
[1:00:07.400 --> 1:00:10.720]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[1:00:10.720 --> 1:00:18.880]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services,
[1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:22.840]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:29.920]  The problem is that the population is growing the fastest where people are less able to
[1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:35.400]  deal with it, so it's in the very poorest places that you're going to have a tripling
[1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:38.240]  in population by 2050.
[1:00:38.240 --> 1:00:44.600]  And so their ability to feed, educate, provide jobs, stability, protect the environment in
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:49.920]  those locations mean they're faced with an almost impossible problem.
[1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:56.960]  Here we can see a chart that looks at the total world population over the last several
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:58.560]  hundred years.
[1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:01.120]  And at first glance, this is a bit scary.
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:07.960]  We go from less than a billion in 1800 and then 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.4 billion where we are
[1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:12.200]  today is happening even faster.
[1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:17.520]  So Melinda and I wondered whether providing new medicines and keeping children alive,
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:22.760]  would that create more of a population problem?
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:26.880]  And what the developing world does not need is more children.
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:32.440]  And I think that was the biggest aha to Bill and me when we got into this work is we asked
[1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:36.440]  ourselves, of course, the same hard-nosed question you'd ask, which is if you get into
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:41.520]  this work and you start to save these children, will women just keep overpopulating the world?
[1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:44.400]  And thank goodness the converse is absolutely true.
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:51.400]  This is a very important question to get right because it was absolutely key for me.
[1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:55.680]  When our foundation first started up, it was focused on reproductive health.
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:02:01.320]  That was the main thing we did because I thought population growth in poor countries is the
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:02.480]  biggest problem they face.
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:06.680]  You've got to help mothers who want to limit family size have the tools and education to
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:07.880]  do that.
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:10.200]  That's the only thing that really counts.
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:14.680]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:21.720]  it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:26.200]  But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:30.960]  But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that.
[1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:34.240]  That's only about three minutes of the nine and a half minute piece.
[1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:35.240]  It's a Band-Aid video.
[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:36.240]  I hope you share it.
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:38.240]  It's got 414,000 views.
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:40.120]  It's about 300 million views.
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:41.560]  And again, they set themselves up as God.
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:43.360]  You can say that's overpopulated in some areas.
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:44.360]  Well, they say be hard-nosed.
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:47.000]  They're not just about to kill all the third world, which is bad enough.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.840]  They're talking about sterilizing everybody, making us mutate into this new creature.
[1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:55.720]  That's where this really goes.
[1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:58.520]  The equation is very simple.
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:05.120]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:10.560]  the military, industrial complex, they control big tech, and everywhere that they have been
[1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:17.160]  in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:23.920]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:26.840]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:32.360]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside
[1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:39.840]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:42.640]  that threatens their monopoly of control.
[1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:47.200]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to the freedom of the
[1:03:47.200 --> 1:03:52.440]  only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:53.440]  So we double your efforts.
[1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:58.440]  We're all in this together.
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:11.040]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:12.800]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:14.480]  Well, so does he.
[1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:19.360]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:20.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:04:20.360 --> 1:04:21.360]  All right.
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:23.960]  I'm hosting all four hours of the Alex Jones show today.
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:25.600]  We've got three hours left in front of us.
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:30.120]  We're in the hour number two on this Monday, April 12, 2021 transmission.
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:36.000]  Owen Schreuer is now down at the border back in McAllen, Texas where the border patrol
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.080]  says it is the worst collapse of the border going on.
[1:04:40.080 --> 1:04:47.000]  We'll go to the facilities that have the ongoing human smuggling going on at a massive level
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.160]  and we will host the fourth hour from right in front of those facilities and right from
[1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:57.000]  that so-called Catholic Charities run by what looks like MS-13 operatives and so much more
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:01.560]  where men go in with whistleblowers told us we caught a lot of it on video and say I'm
[1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:02.560]  here from Pennsylvania.
[1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:03.560]  I'm here from Illinois.
[1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:04.560]  I'm here from Utah.
[1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:06.480]  I want that woman, that woman, that woman.
[1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:09.320]  I'm taking them to make them work in my restaurant or my factory.
[1:05:09.320 --> 1:05:13.200]  I'm going to teach them the way the Lord, according to me, and they give them money and the women
[1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:14.200]  are given to them.
[1:05:14.200 --> 1:05:15.200]  No IDs, no nothing.
[1:05:15.200 --> 1:05:16.200]  Their cell phones are taken.
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:22.320]  I mean, this is the stuff of hell and then the whole leftist media comes and defends and
[1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:26.920]  oh, those were real kids being put in a trunk but they were being taken to have a wonderful
[1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:30.880]  life and Alex Jones was being mean to them.
[1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:35.360]  The left has just signed on to pure evil just like Apple has signed on to helping run the
[1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:40.040]  worst death camps and getting slave labor on the worst death camps in Communist China.
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:42.800]  These are not the moral authorities.
[1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:44.680]  They tell you they are all day.
[1:05:44.680 --> 1:05:49.920]  These are selfish, bad, crazy people that have broken the law of common sense.
[1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:54.240]  They've broken the law of the social compact, the social contract.
[1:05:54.240 --> 1:05:55.240]  Okay.
[1:05:55.240 --> 1:06:00.560]  So if you just joined us, last hour I talked about them, I want to go through it now.
[1:06:00.560 --> 1:06:06.680]  60 minutes came out at DARPA with the same lab that we exposed over a year ago funded
[1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:10.400]  by Bill and Melinda Gates with all these different types of implantable microchips.
[1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:14.160]  Some that are in the vaccine, some that are on a bandage, you put over it, then it works
[1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:19.280]  into your skin, nanoparticles and glass because they can miniaturize things so much now that
[1:06:19.280 --> 1:06:26.520]  also tracks you, the scanner reads, but this is a little green octopus about a millimeter
[1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:33.120]  wide along that little green antennas, little green wires.
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:37.160]  And they put this in you and then it transmits to computers to say, you're sick and we've
[1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:41.280]  got to have this now because if it saves one person, we've always got to wear masks because
[1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:44.840]  you might have germs, might get somebody sick, even though all the studies show that
[1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:49.160]  us sharing our germs makes us healthier and that the mask causes bacterial pneumonia, let's
[1:06:49.160 --> 1:06:52.760]  not worry about those studies.
[1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:59.200]  This is political action and we're told we've got to keep the blue city shut down forever
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:00.720]  unless you're in communist China.
[1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:05.040]  It's all a big sign that we're closed for business and we're not essential.
[1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:10.760]  So see the video for yourself, video, DARPA is working on COVID vaccine implantable microchip
[1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:15.320]  to detect the virus and of course detect whether you've had your vaccines, but this is not
[1:07:15.320 --> 1:07:20.360]  just an implantable chip, this is not just a nanotech sponge.
[1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:25.440]  The vaccines themselves are the real nanotech reprogramming your DNA, it's beyond microchips,
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:30.200]  but they metaphysically still need to get the general public to opt in.
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:34.720]  That's the law of the universe until they go into their final end game and Satan goes
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:40.360]  past free will and starts forcing it then, all hell breaks loose and everybody that
[1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:44.960]  keeps shining on thinking, oh, I get to go back to normal as long as I submit, you never
[1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:45.960]  go back to normal.
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:51.120]  I do every step of the way, 15 days to cut the curve, oh, just two months of a mask,
[1:07:51.120 --> 1:07:56.000]  oh, just a couple months locked down, oh, now it's, oh, years, decades, whoa, it's the
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:00.560]  new normal, I mean, AP, Reuters, CNN, we need to always wear masks, we need new vaccines
[1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:03.920]  every month, every week, hell, I'm sure the vaccine doesn't work, well, you need more
[1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:08.800]  vaccines then and, oh, the children don't get sick from COVID, but that's okay, they're
[1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:10.480]  super spreaders, they got to have it too.
[1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:13.560]  Well, hey, it's tested, it's totally safe, but it's not, it doesn't matter, they're
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:19.520]  lying to you, but don't criticize it, we'll censor you.
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:23.320]  Lying to you, censoring you, hurting you, and the people running it, Bill Millen and
[1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:28.480]  the Gates Foundation is actually known as the Depopulation Institute, I played a clip
[1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:33.240]  earlier of them getting an award for depopulation, and people go, well, you know, there aren't
[1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:39.840]  too many people, and if you go to some Caribbean islands, the place you say this is overpopulated,
[1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:44.160]  but this is about transhumanism, about total control, and the globalists are going to go
[1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:48.720]  after everybody, so all the people signing on to this, playing like you're a big Malthusian
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:52.680]  and you're going to save the planet, you're under attack as well, you're destroying our
[1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:57.240]  birthright, our common sense, our social safety net, we're all being made non-essential, why
[1:08:57.240 --> 1:08:58.240]  are you doing it?
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:01.800]  Well, because Trump didn't want us to all wear masks and stay locked down as much as
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:07.840]  Fauci, so just because he was more common sense, we better wear them forever.
[1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:09.840]  It's Briar Patch.
[1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:10.840]  What does Briar Rabbit say?
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:16.560]  He goes, please, Mr. Weasel or Mr. whatever it was, as I forget the story when I was
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:24.840]  a kid, whatever the predator is, Mr. Fox, please don't throw me back in the Briar Patch, but
[1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:26.240]  the rabbit lives in the Briar Patch.
[1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:29.520]  They're like, and you know what he's saying?
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:30.520]  Trump was in on it?
[1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:33.440]  I mean, I don't think so, but Trump comes out and says, you know, mask, you don't need
[1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:38.440]  a mask, so they go, I'm wearing one forever, I'm going to be buried in one.
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:43.560]  It's all reverse psychology, it's disgusting.
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:47.000]  But the left are sent to college, they're in the academia, they feel like they're part
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.040]  of the technocracy, and they know a lot of it.
[1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:53.240]  A lot of the left knows it's a lie, but it's about their power, you see.
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:56.000]  Yeah, it was a Fox and Briar Rabbit.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:01.960]  So let's go ahead and go to the 60 Minutes piece, which is the same sign as Bill Gates
[1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:05.080]  funded that we showed you a year ago, and I showed you that last hour.
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:10.080]  We told you exactly who they are, showed you the MIT video, showed you the same stuff,
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:17.680]  and other liquid chips they've got, and little micro glass chips, and little silicate, and
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:21.040]  they're like, you know, Southern Power Law Center says it's not true.
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:26.000]  Oh my gosh, they're God, or the media matters, or the ADL.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:31.800]  ADL is like, Jones has got this racist, anti-semitic thing that there's a world government
[1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:34.960]  forming that'll make you take chips, like, what did I say about Jews?
[1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:35.960]  They say that.
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:38.400]  They insert that, because they're paid to do that.
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:39.400]  It's very sad.
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:43.480]  So I don't care whether you're Jewish, or Muslim, or Christian, or agnostic, you shouldn't
[1:10:43.480 --> 1:10:47.840]  let the ADL speak for you, and try to censor everybody.
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:52.800]  It's a very dangerous situation, while they call for their cross to be removed from air
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:56.520]  for talking about a UN document admitting third world replacement migration.
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:01.480]  I mean, that's a fact, that's a UN policy, that's what you're doing.
[1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:04.240]  The people you've already been oppressing and sucking dry, now you're going to bring
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:09.880]  them here to be oppressed here as well, but out-voters, they complete.
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:12.680]  So let's go ahead and go to the 60 minutes piece.
[1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:16.200]  Dr. Hepburn showed us a few current projects.
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:19.680]  Some sound like they're from an episode of Star Trek.
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:26.160]  Consider a ship like the USS Theodore Roosevelt hobbled last year when 1,207 crew members
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:31.840]  started over, look, all the transgenderism, all the infighting, all the 60-day lockdown
[1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:35.800]  to stop racism, to destroy morale, make everybody fight with each other, all the chicoms the
[1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:36.800]  globals take over.
[1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:40.560]  And then they're replacing humans with robots by 2030 in the military, that's the official
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:41.560]  plan.
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:45.480]  So you've got to sabotage the human cohesiveness to go, well, the military's full of race and
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:51.720]  crimes and racism and poop swastikas that are, you know, SJW, false flags, small events.
[1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:55.600]  And so because of all that, we just have to go all robot, it's much more efficient.
[1:11:55.600 --> 1:11:59.600]  And then the globals are in control of the robots, you aren't, they'll follow orders.
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:05.400]  Comprint A, it's a post-human world, they're sabotaging it, and in the future everything
[1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:11.040]  is going to be about who created pro-human communities, anti-5G communities, who moved
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:14.120]  into rural areas, who got prepared, who got ready.
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:20.080]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to the piece.
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:21.080]  Here it is.
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:25.840]  Jeff Burns showed us a few current projects, some sound like they're from an episode of
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:27.680]  Star Trek.
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:34.160]  Consider a ship like the USS Theodore Roosevelt hobbled last year when 1,271 crew members
[1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:35.920]  tested positive for the coronavirus.
[1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:36.920]  Hey, pause.
[1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:39.520]  I've got five seconds.
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:43.360]  Fake PCR test, no one died, hardly anyone was even sick, it was just the cold, they
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:44.360]  made it up.
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:47.040]  But because of the fake problem, now we've got to have chips in you.
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.840]  You see how this works?
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:52.960]  She's more, more, more, once you give into the lockdown, once you give into the mask,
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:54.120]  it never ends, continue.
[1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:57.440]  It was tested positive for the coronavirus.
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:13:02.920]  What if everyone on board had their health monitored with this sub-dermal implant, now
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:05.240]  in late-stage testing?
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:10.920]  It's not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue like
[1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:14.960]  gel engineered to continuously test your blood.
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:15.960]  It's a sensor.
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:19.960]  This tiny green thing in there?
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:25.120]  You put it underneath your skin, and what that tells you is that there are chemical
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:30.960]  reactions going on inside the body, and that signal means you're going to have symptoms
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:31.960]  tomorrow.
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:32.960]  Wow.
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:35.080]  There's an actual transmitter in that?
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:37.120]  Yeah, it's like a check engine light.
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:38.720]  Check this sailor out before he...
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:42.040]  I want to come back with the rest of this, you know, you've all heard of this before,
[1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:43.520]  it's Bill Gates and his Theranos.
[1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:44.520]  It's all fake.
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:45.520]  It's all fake.
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:46.520]  It's all fraud.
[1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:47.520]  It's all criminal.
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:48.520]  But it kills you in the end.
[1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:49.520]  That's the main...
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:53.440]  But they've got a black eye going, look how save it is, I'm black.
[1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:55.000]  The people are awakening.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:58.160]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:13:59.440]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:02.200]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:06.720]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:13.240]  especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:17.200]  when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:20.400]  record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:27.040]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:28.400]  In their own words, they admit it.
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:32.240]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:33.240]  than a decade.
[1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:35.360]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:36.360]  They're faraday cages.
[1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:38.120]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:40.160]  They work absolutely great.
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:45.080]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:48.360]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:49.360]  it's not their business.

[1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:07.480]  cases, are toxic.

[1:15:55.920 --> 1:16:18.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:18.840 --> 1:16:23.720]  So almost everybody else has been taken off the year, almost no one else is able to build
[1:16:23.720 --> 1:16:26.520]  their own infrastructure network, thanks to you supporting us, we were able to, welcome
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:29.000]  back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:33.720]  And now everybody can see the end game, it's a post-human world, nanotech, implantable chips,
[1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:37.760]  and the globalists say no more humans when they're done.
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:42.000]  They started 100 years ago saying they wanted a massive population reduction and by the
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:48.640]  60s they said they wanted 70% dead, then by the 90s they said 80%, then in the new documents
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:53.880]  in the 2000s they said well we want to actually get down about 1% of humans, and then now
[1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:57.240]  the last 10 years or so they've been saying well we just want to get rid of all humans,
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:02.720]  period, we're going to merge the machines, and they just almost come out and say they're
[1:17:02.720 --> 1:17:06.160]  in contact with aliens and they've gotten advanced technology, that's the last part
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:07.640]  they haven't put out there.
[1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:13.080]  The Bible says it's a fallen alien species, it's actually held on this planet with the
[1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:19.360]  red rum by the head honcho, Satan, that are basically eternal beings, but the Bible says
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:25.560]  God finally destroys them, rolls up the universe like a scroll so God can kill them, but that's
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:31.280]  about it, and God is going to have to intervene to save us at some point, so you better hope
[1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:35.840]  the Bible's real because everything else in it's happened, and again the churches are
[1:17:35.840 --> 1:17:39.880]  falling down on their faces because they're not churches, they're going to say take the
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:44.320]  chip, they're going to say they're going to have transgender, and I mean genetically
[1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:52.760]  engineered preachers, this is all exactly what the book of Genesis talks about in the
[1:17:52.760 --> 1:18:00.560]  days of Noah, and it's all going to repeat, it's all repeating already, and so let's finish
[1:18:00.560 --> 1:18:09.120]  up with 60 minutes, oh a ship, it got hobbled, the troops need chips, the good news is it's
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:14.800]  more like 70% of the marines are refusing the vaccines, it's 40% just of one group that
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:18.720]  they already questioned aired to find out who wanted it, and then they selected that group
[1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:22.480]  and by the time they went out of the group it said they'd take it, only 40% took it,
[1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:26.120]  so and I have that from inside sources, so now they're trying to say well the army and
[1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:31.440]  marines you can't go to the mess hall, or you can't go to the PX, the grocery store,
[1:18:31.440 --> 1:18:37.000]  you can't go to the gym unless you've had the vaccine, it's not a vaccine, it's an
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:43.360]  illegal gene therapy, so again it's the boldness of this plan that's so evil, it's a total
[1:18:43.360 --> 1:18:48.680]  takeover, but let me get back to the 60 minutes piece, so we're just analyzing each little
[1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:54.680]  piece of lie, continue, means you're going to have symptoms tomorrow, wow, there's an
[1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:59.480]  actual transmitter in that, yeah it's like a check engine like, check this sailor out
[1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:05.520]  before he infects other people, that's right, sailors would get the signal then self-administer
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:10.760]  a blood draw and test themselves on site, look at that, we can have that information
[1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:17.600]  in 3-5 minutes, as you truncate that time, as you diagnose and treat, what you do is
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:25.000]  you stop the infection in its tracks, so this is medicalization, look at that term, it's
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:29.200]  a fraud where the system becomes predatory and sucks you on the scan, Bill Gates is
[1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:34.040]  always one of this, his last front lady was the Theranos woman, made tens of millions
[1:19:34.040 --> 1:19:37.760]  of dollars, he was really the front guy, he's admitted, even from the documentary she's
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:42.400]  in, oh it's a woman, she's young, she's pretty, you know, oh my god, we can test blood instantly
[1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:46.120]  and say we have cancer, we're going to get a cold, everyone should be blood tested daily
[1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:55.880]  by Theranos, it's all a lie, and so it's Theranos 2.0, this whole thing, none of it is to help
[1:19:55.880 --> 1:20:03.640]  you, all of it is to kill you, they want to get rid of the US military, and now they're
[1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:09.880]  saying oh there's all these neurological disorders from people that took the COVID shot, they're
[1:20:09.880 --> 1:20:14.200]  conflating it with those, saying oh well maybe they had COVID, yeah you get COVID when you
[1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:23.880]  get shot, that's why you get so damn sick, so Bill Gates has thousands of front people,
[1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:29.720]  look it up, you're in danger, we're all in grave danger, now I don't normally air a
[1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:33.360]  clip two times in a row but I aired this closer to the end of the show yesterday, it's on
[1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:37.240]  band.video in the most banned section, so just click on the left hand corner, you'll
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:41.320]  see most banned videos, and they're mainly medical videos that they've been banning of
[1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:46.080]  scientists and others, the other DeSantis speeches in there, his round table discussion,
[1:20:46.080 --> 1:20:56.040]  but this is a great lawyer, she's a constitutional lawyer, Leah Dundas, California Board of Education,
[1:20:56.040 --> 1:20:59.680]  she's talking to where they are trying to secretly vaccinate children, how they passed
[1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:04.800]  off years ago, they didn't get shots without parental consent, age 12 and up, this is insane,
[1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:10.880]  she knocks it out of the park, go to band.video, get it on your email, your text message, this
[1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:19.320]  is a war, warn people, it's only got 193,000 views, these 50 million views, lady goes off
[1:21:19.320 --> 1:21:25.360]  on Orange County Board of Education for wanting to secretly vaccinate children, I would say
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:33.840]  powerful woman, or powerful, lawyer goes off, we need to change that headline, but still
[1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:37.920]  at least the guy's got it up, great job, so that needs to go viral folks, he can share
[1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:38.920]  it, here it is.
[1:21:38.920 --> 1:21:42.720]  Leah Dundas, human rights attorney, late last week I am informed a meeting occurred between
[1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:46.000]  Orange County Health Officer Dr. Clayton Shell and Orange County Board of Education Superintendent
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:50.280]  Al Mahars, during which time they apparently tried to find a way to quote sidestep and
[1:21:50.280 --> 1:21:54.560]  entirely remove informed parental consent for the COVID vaccine, and also turn Orange
[1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:59.760]  County school campuses into vaccination centers, the COVID-19 vaccine is an experimental medical
[1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:04.520]  protocol authorized under the Emergency Use Authorization Act, and as such you cannot
[1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:09.320]  mandate it for anyone, nor can you sidestep informed consent, there is a reason that kids
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:13.360]  cannot smoke, drive, drink, have sex, vote or die for this country, and it is because
[1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:18.080]  the law says they lack the capacity to understand those decisions, and that applies here more
[1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:23.680]  than ever, hear me loud and hear me well, we will not be morphing our school campuses
[1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:28.080]  into COVID vaccine centers for delivery of an experimental medical protocol that killed
[1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:32.120]  every damned ferret in the last animal study they did, until such time they had to abandon
[1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:35.840]  that study, and then, and then they didn't even do the study this time around because
[1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:36.840]  we are the study.
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:39.680]  Oh I didn't pause, back it up 10 seconds, I mean I had even forgotten that they did
[1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:44.960]  an mRNA study and it killed all the ferrets, I mean, folks, that's why the former chief
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:50.400]  scientist at Pfizer said it's the end of the world, it takes six months to a year to start
[1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:55.000]  killing everybody, it's on purpose, it's unbelievable, and they're going to say a new virus is
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:59.280]  building it, it'll totally collapse society which costs what it wants, continue.
[1:22:59.280 --> 1:23:05.160]  They didn't even do the study this time around because we are the study, the last time humans
[1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:09.600]  launched a plan like this to conduct experimental medical protocols on vulnerable populations
[1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:15.600]  was in Joseph Mengele's direction, he was an MD known as the angel of death, okay, and
[1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:20.200]  he was part of the SS and in 1943 he was assigned to Auschwitz where he saw an opportunity to
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:26.000]  conduct gene research, quote, focused primarily on children with no regard for the health
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  or safety of the victims, this is off the internet, you can Google it.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.080]  You know what else is gene research?
[1:23:32.080 --> 1:23:35.600]  Experimental COVID vaccines with the trans gene inside of it, if you don't believe me
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:38.560]  go pull the EUA application for the J&J shot.
[1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:43.040]  I come from a long line of Eastern Europeans, Hungarians, and Romanian groups, groups that
[1:23:43.040 --> 1:23:48.200]  fled the persecution of the Red Terror Communist death squads in the early 1900s and those
[1:23:48.200 --> 1:23:52.520]  of us who didn't make it to America ended up facing the Nazi death squads in the lesser
[1:23:52.520 --> 1:23:58.880]  known holocaust that was the Romani holocaust, there is a reason my daughter is named Katia.
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:04.520]  Her Romani great-grandmother was Katirina Choma and I for one have not forgotten the
[1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:08.760]  lessons of our history, the Third Reich did not end with experiments on children nor
[1:24:08.760 --> 1:24:14.840]  when those children died, the Third Reich ended in 1946 when we put the doctors who committed
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:20.200]  these human experiments on trial in Nuremberg and then we put them to death, it ended with
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:25.040]  the adoption of the Nuremberg code so we would never repeat the sins of history and it states
[1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:29.120]  and I quote, the voluntary consent of this human subject is absolutely essential.
[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:35.400]  Dr. Chow and Dr. Maharis, you are hereby unnoticed, last week you appear to have knowingly hatched
[1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:40.880]  a plan to sidestep and or violate international, federal and state law, not just the Nuremberg
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:45.080]  informed consent language, but also the black letter law, the E.U.A. as well as California-
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:48.280]  All right, the full video is on them, fullwars.com and band.video, she's on fire, she's totally
[1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:51.640]  right, it's all illegal, it's all criminal.
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:54.640]  Gerald and South Carolina, go ahead and you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:55.640]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:01.280]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:04.440]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:10.720]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away,
[1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:12.640]  uh, living defense saved my life.
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:16.960]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:18.400]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:24.120]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:30.880]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:37.040]  kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:41.200]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:43.000]  That's right where we're at brother.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:47.400]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:51.800]  and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:55.320]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:59.400]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attack of humanity, with all the terrible
[1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:03.520]  things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening
[1:26:03.520 --> 1:26:04.520]  as well.
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:08.680]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things that the republic doesn't get to see.
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:14.320]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:19.800]  or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:24.040]  They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared.
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:25.040]  They're looking for leadership.
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:27.760]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:28.760]  You fund us.

[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will target
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:41.920]  you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:42.920]  That's our job.
[1:26:42.920 --> 1:26:48.160]  So please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can meet the shock groups
[1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:49.160]  in the information war.

[1:26:50.160 --> 1:27:01.160]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:10.160]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:17.200]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:18.200]  in males.
[1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:24.240]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:28.960]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:29.960]  Yes.
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:36.400]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:41.400]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:42.960]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:45.040]  Go to the M4SWORD store.
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:55.360]  Never been a better time than right now, super male vitality at M4SWORD.com.
[1:27:55.360 --> 1:28:12.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:29.600]  The Nazarist Decay, another ragtag band.
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:58.600]  Thank God for the renegade, and the lives they lead, fall ahead of, their time, and
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:16.040]  without the renegade, Lord knows where we'd be, and I'm speaking of renegades of mine.
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:23.920]  Another ragtag band declaring independence, it's a great song, which you play it in full
[1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:24.920]  sometime.
[1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:33.000]  All right, as it is often is, a listener called Rob Dove a month ago and said, you've
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:38.240]  got to look at John Hopkins' Spars 2025, 2028 document, and over the next month we
[1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:41.800]  poked at it and read it and looked at it and did that huge viral report that General Flynn,
[1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:44.520]  former head of defense intelligence, and others have said is so important.
[1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:45.520]  It's a band on video.
[1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:46.520]  It's got about 3 million views.
[1:29:46.520 --> 1:29:51.160]  Last time I checked, it needs to be seen by 500 million.
[1:29:51.160 --> 1:29:58.440]  Well, a caller called in, and he said, you know, John Hopkins does run the show, we'll
[1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:03.160]  play a clip of him here in a moment, because his name was Ken, wasn't it, and memory serves.
[1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:07.960]  And he said, you know, John Hopkins is the big bill of millenegades you in front.
[1:30:07.960 --> 1:30:11.480]  It creates the final operational documents.
[1:30:11.480 --> 1:30:16.000]  It's as important as any other groups combined.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:18.200]  And then they roll it out against the people.
[1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:22.600]  So he said, you need to read Preparedness for a High Impact Respiratory Pathogen from
[1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:26.440]  2019, September, John Hopkins Center for Public Health.
[1:30:26.440 --> 1:30:29.520]  And it's the same people wrote it.
[1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:36.560]  And so last night I scanned over some of it, and I scanned over it again today, and it's
[1:30:36.560 --> 1:30:40.400]  even worse than he said.
[1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:45.280]  It calls for global government, says, nations are the problem, only the UN can respond.
[1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:51.080]  So we have to make sure the media all does what the UN says, and it talks about forced
[1:30:51.080 --> 1:30:53.600]  inoculation, just total control.
[1:30:53.600 --> 1:30:56.760]  And just thank God, Lakers are reading all this, because, I mean, I can't even keep track
[1:30:56.760 --> 1:30:57.760]  of it all anymore.
[1:30:57.760 --> 1:31:04.360]  And it's all a giant power grab for them, while they kill us, and give themselves liability
[1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:10.720]  protection at the same time.
[1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:17.440]  So this is their takeover plan, and I saw a video years ago by Jordan Peterson.
[1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:19.120]  You know, I like Jordan Peterson.
[1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:22.560]  We've had some guests on the Attack Peterson, and I don't think Peterson's perfect, and
[1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:23.560]  nobody's perfect.
[1:31:23.560 --> 1:31:26.160]  But I think Jordan Peterson's very positive overall.
[1:31:26.160 --> 1:31:29.520]  I know he's not been censored as much as I am, so people think, well, he must not be
[1:31:29.520 --> 1:31:30.520]  good, whatever.
[1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:32.080]  A lot of what he says is true.
[1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:33.600]  I just judge things off that.
[1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:38.640]  I watch him, and he's made the same observances that I've made, but he's done even more research
[1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:42.920]  on a lot of the studies, and he gets into a study that authoritarianism is usually obsessed
[1:31:42.920 --> 1:31:46.480]  with infectious diseases, and that's a sign of it, and that authoritarians use infectious
[1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:50.720]  disease for control, and the more authoritarian a society is, the more they're obsessed with
[1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:53.760]  this, and also the more disease they have, they quote, the more they counter it with
[1:31:53.760 --> 1:31:54.760]  authoritarianism.
[1:31:54.760 --> 1:31:57.080]  Well, that's why the globalists did this.
[1:31:57.080 --> 1:31:59.800]  That's why the globalists did this.
[1:31:59.800 --> 1:32:04.160]  So I'll play that clip next segment, and then I'll get into the contrived stage riots,
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:09.080]  and how that's going into overdrive with the show and trial and the rest of it.
[1:32:09.080 --> 1:32:17.600]  But let's get to this part of the phone call from a caller last night on my Sunday show
[1:32:17.600 --> 1:32:23.320]  who had gone and read this, and I went and now scanned over it, and it's absolutely true
[1:32:23.320 --> 1:32:24.320]  and then worse.
[1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:25.560]  It's worse than what he said.
[1:32:25.560 --> 1:32:26.560]  So here's the caller.
[1:32:26.560 --> 1:32:27.560]  Here he is.
[1:32:27.560 --> 1:32:32.320]  I just wanted to call and expose to the info warriors here a document that I found whenever
[1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:37.080]  I was researching a lot of this stuff on the John Hopkins Center for Health Security website.
[1:32:37.080 --> 1:32:42.920]  And there's a document they put out in 2019 of September, and it's called preparedness
[1:32:42.920 --> 1:32:48.120]  for a high impact respiratory pathogen pandemic.
[1:32:48.120 --> 1:32:52.320]  Preparedness for a high impact respiratory pathogen pandemic.
[1:32:52.320 --> 1:32:58.400]  So basically, this document kind of lays out that they already know that in their R&D,
[1:32:58.400 --> 1:33:01.200]  they've got aimed at rapid vaccine development for Nobel threats.
[1:33:01.200 --> 1:33:05.800]  They know that these mRNA vaccines are widely seen as highly promising, or at least that's
[1:33:05.800 --> 1:33:10.960]  what they believe amongst themselves, but that they have not yet broken through with
[1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:12.240]  any licensed products.
[1:33:12.240 --> 1:33:16.440]  So they admit in this document under the medical countermeasures that you'll see, those are
[1:33:16.440 --> 1:33:20.920]  key terms, and they know that they cannot get it approved without forcing everybody
[1:33:20.920 --> 1:33:22.960]  to do it because they're scared to have to do it.
[1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:25.520]  So in this document, they explain that a little bit.
[1:33:25.520 --> 1:33:29.920]  Under medical countermeasures, you'll find the things about vaccines about the mRNA vaccines,
[1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:35.400]  but it goes on in detail about NPIs or what they call non-pharmaceutical interventions.
[1:33:35.400 --> 1:33:39.720]  And that's going to be to the social distancing, the travel restrictions, all the different
[1:33:39.720 --> 1:33:42.200]  things that they do to us that limit our civil liberties.
[1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:48.720]  And they even admit that in the document that NPIs will inherently limit our social liberties.
[1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:54.280]  Any liberties that we have, they admit in here that coronavirus has no medical countermeasure
[1:33:54.280 --> 1:33:55.280]  that they don't.
[1:33:55.280 --> 1:33:56.280]  Oh my God, this is incredible.
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:02.600]  Swab said that last year, he said corona isn't a threat, we're just using it as a threat.
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:03.600]  Wow.
[1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:04.600]  Tell me more.
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:08.240]  They admit that there's no vaccines and that there were unequivocally effective antivirals
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:12.400]  for these seven different viral groups that they put on here that are consistent with
[1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:14.120]  pandemic pathogens.
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:19.280]  And in this document, they show that coronavirus or SARS is a zoonic origin, human-human spread,
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:22.440]  has a high mortality, and has no countermeasures.
[1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:26.960]  They're admitting this in September of 2019 to the entire world, to anybody who sees these
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:27.960]  documents.
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:30.120]  So in 2019, they were prepping everybody for this.
[1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:33.960]  They even prep everybody in the medical industry that they're going to need to get mask, and
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:35.680]  mask going to be hard to come by.
[1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:40.240]  But they say out of these seven viruses that are consistent with the pandemic pathogen,
[1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:43.760]  the only one that has a high mortality is coronavirus.
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:46.160]  So that's just one of the things they talk about in there.
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:51.080]  They say, is a given existing approaches, technologies, and policies, vaccine development
[1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:55.920]  take an estimate of 15 years and cost $1.4 billion to do.
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:01.200]  So they know that it's going to take them 15 years to get a viral vector vaccine for
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:02.600]  something like this.
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:06.600]  But they admit that they've developed these market failures, so they were prepping all
[1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:07.600]  this.
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:11.360]  And whenever they move into non-pharmaceutical interventions, that's called NPIs, that's
[1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:13.880]  another key search term for this document.
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:18.120]  They teach you about the non-pharmaceutical interventions and the things that they're
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:19.120]  going to use.
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:21.880]  It sounds like a smart guy, I mean, just tell me about yourself.
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:24.120]  How are you able to analyze this document so well?
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:26.280]  I've been listening to you guys for 13 years.
[1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:29.000]  I was awake before I started listening to you.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  I heard people talking crap about you on different stuff on YouTube 13, 14 years ago, and I decided
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  I'd just tune in to InfoWars and kind of find out for myself, and I really woke up, got
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.480]  involved with the We Are Change group that was here in Oklahoma for a while, whenever
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:44.720]  they were putting up that documentary about the Murr Building bombing.
[1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:46.720]  But anyway, I kind of got out of it for a while.
[1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:47.720]  I got saved.
[1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:50.880]  And you know, Jesus Christ says, I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man comes
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:52.560]  with us under the Father, but my...
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:55.640]  Is it incredible how the Holy Spirit suddenly gives you discernment?
[1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:57.160]  Well, that's what it is.
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:35:58.560]  And you know, I thought I was awake.
[1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:00.520]  I thought I knew the truth until I got saved.
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:02.440]  That happened when I was about 29.
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:06.640]  And then recently, since all this happened after November 3rd and everything that's going
[1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:10.440]  on since January 6th, I've really kind of gotten back into research and this, and I'm
[1:36:10.440 --> 1:36:11.440]  realizing we're all under attack.
[1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:12.440]  They're trying to kill us all.
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:16.120]  So what they're going to do is, just as you guys have been saying, they're going to throw
[1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:19.480]  all of this stuff at us at home, they're going to stabilize us at home because they've
[1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:22.960]  already demoralized us, as was said by Hernandez recently.
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:26.120]  But what they're going to do is they're going to kick off a world war and economical
[1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:27.760]  apps at the same time they do it.
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:30.920]  So we really have to stay together and stay strong to be able to figure this out.
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:31.920]  We have to stay together.
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:34.040]  Did you see all the articles came out where the Head Black Clive is a wet matter lady
[1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:39.920]  that made $10.6 billion, has like giant facilities with huge landing strips and everything?
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:43.400]  And my whole point is, doesn't that idiot know when everything goes down that it'll
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:44.400]  all be worthless?
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:45.400]  Yeah.
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:46.400]  It'll all will be.
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:49.400]  The Bible says it'll all burn up one day anyway, right?
[1:36:49.400 --> 1:36:53.040]  But we don't have to go along with it and we don't have to keep going along with it.
[1:36:53.040 --> 1:36:57.160]  I'm just saying it's so pathetic that Soros hired her to try to lead black people into
[1:36:57.160 --> 1:36:58.920]  race war, which they haven't done.
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:02.440]  And then she's an idiot in LA with a private airfield in a mansion, it's all going to be
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:03.440]  destroyed.
[1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:04.920]  Yeah, it is.
[1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:05.920]  Not by us.
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:07.680]  I mean, she's an idiot.
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:12.280]  They're all idiots, whether it's where it's Brian Stout first, the full weather idiot,
[1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:15.920]  the yellow guy yesterday's Sunday show.
[1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:16.920]  You can see that for yourself.
[1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:22.560]  But look at this in the John Hopkins document, page 36, the potential problem of national
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:27.200]  sovereignty in pandemics, and they say, of course, it's got to be gotten rid of.
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:29.920]  And the UN now calls that what do they call it?
[1:37:29.920 --> 1:37:30.920]  Vaccine nationalism.
[1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:31.920]  Yes.
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:35.400]  I think we're to those nation states, not just your freedom, it's the nation states
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:41.000]  that are not essential, only the murderous UN is essential with Bill Gates at its head.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:46.160]  All right, we're going to come back and I'm going to shift gears into the triggered race
[1:37:46.160 --> 1:37:47.160]  war.
[1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:48.160]  They're now putting into high gear.
[1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:50.520]  They're setting up the summer to be really bad.
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:55.760]  When I tell you to supplement your natural diet, so you'll be healthier and funnier for
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:37:58.600]  at the same time, I'm not lecturing you.
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:37:59.760]  I eat too much red meat.
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:00.760]  I drink too much.
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:01.760]  I work too much.
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:06.960]  I have my own issues with stress, but I can tell you, without winter sun, without
[1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:11.320]  vitamin mineral fusion, without lung cleanse, all three of which I take every day, I would
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:13.880]  not be able to continue on what I do.
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:19.000]  These are amazing products, and if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals, you're
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:22.720]  not going to be able to function in fact, you're going to die as we will starve for
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:24.720]  like a food.
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:29.760]  These products have it all concentrated in one place for you to make sure that every
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:35.560]  essential vitamin mineral you need, you get the D3, the K, in winter sun, and all of them
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:40.680]  together with amino acids in the vitamin mineral fusion, and then lung cleanse.
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:42.040]  Research of yourself, it's amazing.
[1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:48.920]  They're all 50% off together, 40% off individually, at M4warStore.com, back in stock for a limited
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:50.520]  time, and at Funcie M4war.

[1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:59.600]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:04.680]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:05.680]  system.

[1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:58.920]  Randy Dewright, Randy Dewright, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:39:59.920]  Go ahead.
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:02.360]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:07.880]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:13.360]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:18.600]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous,
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:19.600]  actually.
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:22.680]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:40:22.680 --> 1:40:26.720]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:30.280]  what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:34.840]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:40.000]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  wonderful, you know.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:45.280]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:51.880]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:55.360]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:40:55.360 --> 1:40:59.520]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:02.720]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:05.840]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they
[1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:07.120]  can to shut us down.
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:11.440]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:12.440]  listening to as well.
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:18.560]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film,
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:23.440]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:24.920]  in the face of this thing.
[1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:27.040]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:31.360]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:36.360]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:42.000]  great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:46.640]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:51.480]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:54.880]  Thank you so much.
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:42:01.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:42:01.880 --> 1:42:11.120]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back on Broadcasting Worldwide on your host Alex
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:12.120]  Jones.
[1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:18.560]  Owen Schreuer will co-host the fourth hour with me today from the U.S.-Mexico border at
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:24.600]  that Catholic charity that's really a smuggling facility, engaged in all sorts of illegal activity
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:25.600]  in my view.
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:27.880]  I mean, the vibe didn't sign an executive order.
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:32.240]  There's not a law, immigration law has been waived illegally, you can't do that.
[1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:35.080]  Even Associated Press says they're not doing paperwork, they're not even checking IDs,
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:37.200]  they're just giving them to quote charities.
[1:42:37.200 --> 1:42:38.200]  Well that's illegal.
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:42.280]  And what the border patrol is doing is illegal, the Catholic charity is doing illegal, loading
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:47.760]  the kids to the back of vans, and the back of trunks is illegal.
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:50.760]  I'm not guaranteed if I had, you know, my four kids sticking them in a trunk, people
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:55.400]  call the cops on me, but oh, it's illegal aliens, don't do that.
[1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:57.080]  I care about those people.
[1:42:57.080 --> 1:42:58.560]  They're being brought here to be exploited.
[1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:03.160]  In fact, I aired it on a special Saturday show, but we should probably air that footage
[1:43:03.160 --> 1:43:06.600]  from, guys, give me a reprint of the list of Saturday's videos.
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:08.560]  A lot of those need to be aired on the main shows.
[1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:14.120]  I mean, we had a female police officer off duty, I'm gonna leave it at that, she goes
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:18.600]  in undercover, she's doing, she's a senior lady, let's just leave it at that, she's
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:26.560]  older, she's been in the police force a long time, and she goes in and she's sitting there
[1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:29.520]  talking to these women, and there's the guy right there going, I want that woman, I want
[1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:34.320]  that woman, I want that one, I only want single women, and he's like, I give you a lot of
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:37.280]  money, because he's just like in a movie, a thug, he's like bragging in front of everybody,
[1:43:37.280 --> 1:43:40.240]  and they're like, okay, sir, we'll give you the women, and then she's talking to them,
[1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:41.240]  well, what is he doing?
[1:43:41.240 --> 1:43:43.760]  Well, I'm gonna be taking the Pennsylvania and work for him, he's gonna teach me about
[1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:44.760]  God.
[1:43:44.760 --> 1:43:49.120]  And then the guy comes out and starts talking to our camera crew, admitting a bunch of it,
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:54.960]  I mean, you can't make this up, I guess he spoke some Spanish, the women told him like,
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:58.800]  hey, watch that woman talking to you, so he tries to follow her out and then runs into
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:05.240]  our people.
[1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:11.640]  And let's just say this, he's a lucky man, because these guys did not like, didn't like
[1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:12.640]  you.
[1:44:12.640 --> 1:44:16.720]  That's the thing, I got overwhelmed and had to go stop the car, I mean, I'm sick of watching
[1:44:16.720 --> 1:44:20.120]  kids get smuggled, they're doing it illegally, I know it is, and I went and threw myself
[1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:24.600]  in the car, be like, we'll run you over, I was ready to, whatever, that's what I do.
[1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:30.800]  And it's not some superhero thing, it's that I'm pissed.
[1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:35.080]  And I'm not gonna just sit here and take this crap anymore.
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:39.840]  So that's in the fourth hour, now let's talk about this.
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:45.520]  The culture war, the CIA, the globalist mind control system has literally put out hundreds
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:50.480]  of movies and TV shows, hundreds, where black people are wonderful and all the whites are
[1:44:50.480 --> 1:44:55.840]  evil and the blacks rise up and kill the white people and it's wonderful and Target publishes
[1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:59.480]  books saying do it and you just see it everywhere, it's just wall to wall.
[1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:03.520]  Now I'm not stupid, they want me to hate black people and they want black people to hate
[1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:04.520]  me.
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:08.480]  That doesn't mean there aren't some crazy, suggestible black people, just like there
[1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:12.880]  are all these other crazy people, white people, you know, going and having their son's genitals
[1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:18.160]  cut off because it's trendy or taking deadly COVID shots.
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:25.240]  So I don't like big packs of racist trendies, black, white together, going out shooting,
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:28.680]  killing, raping and robbing people and they're gonna get their ass killed doing it and it's
[1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:29.680]  a bad thing.
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:31.160]  I wish I could wake them up.
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:36.400]  Hell, a lot of the folks that got arrested at the Capitol, the only six, are being tortured
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:42.400]  and beat up by the all black staff of the DC jail and of course that's going on.
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:48.360]  I mean, we project on the black people that somehow they're better than anybody else and
[1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:52.120]  people are, I mean, Charles Barkley said before, he goes, black people are some of the most
[1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:54.000]  racist people he's ever seen.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:46:01.280]  Let's just be honest and I love everybody but I'm not gonna lie about this and so what
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:07.640]  we've got is a bunch of black people hopped up by the media with a bunch of white people
[1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:12.920]  and others with them, burning buildings down, shooting up the police station and then they
[1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:17.600]  wonder why one guy got shot and killed last night and now there's a whole new hysteria
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:18.600]  going on.
[1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:22.920]  I mean, if a real race war breaks out, it's gonna be a lot of white people and black people,
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:23.920]  everything else dead.
[1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:27.480]  You're gonna talk about hundreds of thousands, not a few.
[1:46:27.480 --> 1:46:32.920]  It'll make blacks killin' blacks look like a walk in the park and I don't want that.
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:36.680]  I genuinely wanted to treat the globalists but this is pure BS.
[1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:43.360]  So A, you guys can grow a little background noise for context if you want.
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:53.440]  A, we've got all this stuff going on and it's all the media hyping it up that is basically
[1:46:53.440 --> 1:46:54.440]  causing this.
[1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:59.520]  We're here, we'll just play the clip, do it that way.
[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:02.000]  Which clip is it on here that I sent you guys since we're not playing audio?
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:03.400]  I'll tell you the one I want.
[1:47:03.400 --> 1:47:09.000]  I'm not mad, I just want to play with audio so I'm gonna play some of these.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  Let's go ahead and go ahead and play number nine then, go ahead and play it.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  This is video of the flip-lockers and people stealing dozens of pairs of shoes apiece and
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  the liquor store and the CCC's pizza and just everything else got robbed.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  This had nothing to do with the sentinel drug addict, was basically killed by the chikoms.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  Do I feel sorry for that guy?
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  Totally drugged out on that drug?
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  Absolutely.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  Am I glad that he fell to this evil?
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:02.240]  No, I'm not glad that George Floyd is dead.
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:08.880]  But him as the poster child for this lawlessness and a target being looted and just all of
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:15.520]  this is pointless unless you're the globalist that want to divide and conquer the country.
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:23.640]  Now here's the next clip, it's on infowars.com, video shows Dante Wright, Minneapolis man
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:29.480]  shot by cops waving around a gun and that's what the police said he did, he threw a cinder
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:32.720]  block at him, tried to run over people, it was just total bedlam.
[1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:35.880]  Let me ask you a question.
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:40.120]  What do you think is going to happen when you get 10,000 teenagers running around burning
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:41.880]  down buildings and waving guns around?
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:46.200]  I'm surprised only one person died last night.
[1:48:46.200 --> 1:48:49.280]  Let me tell you what I would be doing if I was around that, leaving town.
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:52.160]  But what if everything's in your house, everything's in your business, what are you going to do?
[1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:59.320]  Well if you try to go guard it like you saw folks do in St. Louis or like what you saw
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:02.760]  Kyle Rittenhouse do, you're going to prison.
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:08.840]  And so the media is literally turning loose a bunch of drunk armed teenagers on us and
[1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:13.480]  then trying to sell us the idea that we should turn our guns in so we can't protect ourselves
[1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:18.760]  and if we end up shooting those teenagers, well we're the bad guys.
[1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:24.960]  But I've got videos today of cops in Georgia, cops in California, cops all over getting
[1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:37.960]  shot and killed, here's another one, go ahead and play the audio of this if you got it.
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:47.760]  So there you go and so ladies and gentlemen, it just goes on and on and on and on.
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:51.040]  Can we show some of the clips I gave you from the show guys and cops get shot?
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:56.240]  Because I mean we're never supposed to hear about them.
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:00.240]  But there's countless videos of police being shot.
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:10.560]  Yeah, I know you've got temp tags, you've got registration for the vehicle, I'll need
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:13.040]  registration and driver's license as well.
[1:50:13.040 --> 1:50:15.240]  This is New Mexico.
[1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:29.760]  There were cops shot and killed in four states last night, we shot in a bunch of other states.
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:34.120]  Come with me to my vehicle that way I can run your name and date of birth and then that
[1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:35.720]  way I can get my return, okay?
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:38.720]  Go ahead, ship the vehicle off.
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:40.720]  If you want, it's up to you.
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:45.160]  We're going to come back next hour with all of that for you ladies and gentlemen but we
[1:50:45.160 --> 1:50:49.920]  have a whole bunch of videos of cops being shot in Georgia, in New Mexico, in California,
[1:50:49.920 --> 1:50:52.960]  all over the place and you never hear their names, you never learn who they are when they
[1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:54.960]  die.
[1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:58.920]  Unless you're a cop and you have a heart attack two days after the Capitol riot and
[1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:04.160]  then it's the end of the world, Pearl Harbor and they lock people up who just walk between
[1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:11.080]  the velvet ropes in solitary confinement and then the black jail guards come and beat
[1:51:11.080 --> 1:51:17.200]  them up because the news told everybody that they're all white supremacists.
[1:51:17.200 --> 1:51:20.720]  That's why they released the black people that were Antifa who went into the Capitol
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:25.280]  because that doesn't fit the narrative, you see, they've got to be released.
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:29.560]  It's got to be white versus black while they're killing all of us, while they're targeting
[1:51:29.560 --> 1:51:34.880]  our children with Satanism, while they're feeding us all GMO, while they're 5G-ing us,
[1:51:34.880 --> 1:51:36.240]  while they're chemtrailing us.
[1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:41.760]  We're going to go to the next hour, information overload, Ezra Levant from up in Canada where
[1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:47.000]  there's 200 armed police, raiding churches, riot police, shutting churches down, the
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:50.960]  same all over the world, old people being denied food and chili and they don't have
[1:51:50.960 --> 1:51:53.280]  their COVID vaccine passes.
[1:51:53.280 --> 1:51:57.760]  I mean, it's all here, it's all happening separately.

[1:53:37.960 --> 1:53:43.320]  off as well, and infowarstore.com, again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very
[1:53:43.320 --> 1:53:47.520]  private person, but because of the globalist, their attack on humanity, I've been forced
[1:53:47.520 --> 1:53:51.800]  the last 27 years to be a public figure, and we've given the globalist one hell of a run
[1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:56.280]  for their money because of God, and I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk
[1:53:56.280 --> 1:53:59.760]  about God all day, but just give me a break, the Satanism's out in the open, I've always
[1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:04.560]  been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear,
[1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:07.920]  and I get it, a lot of you've been turned off by big churches, a lot of you've been turned
[1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:13.280]  off by the corrupt priest class system, and I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them,
[1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:19.520]  but it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:24.000]  essential, and God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:28.040]  to have life, and so that's what infowar is really all about, so thank you all for your
[1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:31.560]  word of mouth, thank you for spreading the word about infowar, and thank you for supporting

[1:54:44.840 --> 1:54:48.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:57.720]  All right, it's hour number three, I want to get back into the engineered race war and
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:01.480]  how to stop it in the next segment, but I mentioned this last hour, so I'm going to
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:06.720]  get to it now, Jordan Peterson is a smart professor, and he does study human psychology
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:12.560]  and I think overall, I think about 98% of what he says is dead on accurate, I've been
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:17.880]  critical of some things that he said and done, but when he talks about Hitler and the authoritarian
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:23.540]  mind, it's dead on, and that's why the globalists in their studies knew that infectious disease
[1:55:23.540 --> 1:55:27.360]  would be the way to bring in tyranny, and that's what they've done with COVID-19, so
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:34.280]  here's a lecture he did four years ago in 2017 on why Hitler bathed so much, and again
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:38.600]  it was because it was a control freak thing, and I'm all for bathing because I feel fresh
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:40.880]  and good when I do it.
[1:55:40.880 --> 1:55:44.840]  Humans are almost reentrance, we love water, but with Hitler it was a little different,
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:47.880]  and here's Jordan Peterson laying it out.
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:52.120]  You think about a totalitarian state, you think about the Nazis and their goose stepping,
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:57.120]  what's happening is that every single person in the military becomes an identical unit,
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:58.120]  right?
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:04.080]  They're all uniform, and they're all in some sense imitating the dictator in an absolutely
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:10.560]  perfect way, and so the dictator wants to impose strict uniformity on the entire population.
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:16.240]  That's order, order, and one of the things we've discovered that's really interesting
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:23.400]  is that disgust sensitivity is associated with orderliness, and that's associated with
[1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:28.280]  conscientiousness, and one of the things about Hitler was that he was very disgust sensitive,
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:34.040]  and a lot of his hatred for non-Aryans, so imagine inside the Aryan box it was all uniform.
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:39.240]  Inside it was all parasites and predators, and that was a manifestation of disgust, not
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:40.240]  of fear.
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:44.960]  It's a whole different thing, and if you read Hitler's table talk, which is a collection
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:50.640]  of his spontaneous dinner speeches from 1939 to 1942, it's a very interesting book.
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:58.240]  You see that his metaphor for the Aryan race was a body, a pure body, unassaulted by parasites
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:03.480]  or predators, and that he was trying to erect a border around it to keep all of that away,
[1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:08.880]  so it's an immunological disgust like metaphor, and there's some recent work that was published
[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:13.720]  in clause one about three years ago showing that brilliant study, should have got much
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:18.800]  more attention, showing that if you went around and sampled political attitudes in different
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:24.680]  countries or even within the same country, what you found was that the higher the prevalence
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:30.320]  of infectious diseases, the higher the probability of totalitarian political attitudes at the
[1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:34.960]  local level, and you can imagine, well, what happens if there's infectious diseases is
[1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:36.880]  you want to put borders around everything.
[1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:40.960]  You don't want free movement between ideas or people because that's partly how the disease
[1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:41.960]  spreads.
[1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:47.000]  You're going to have much more strict sexual rules, for example, because that's a great
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:52.960]  way for diseases to be transmitted, and before Hitler went on his rampage against the non-Aryans,
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:57.240]  he cleaned up all the factories, like he went in there and fumigated them, it was part of
[1:57:57.240 --> 1:58:02.120]  the law, and he went on a public health campaign to get rid of tuberculosis, and he got rid
[1:58:02.120 --> 1:58:03.960]  of the bugs in the factories as well.
[1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:09.200]  He used cyclone B, that's an insecticide, and that's the gas that he used in the gas
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:13.840]  chambers eventually, so first it was the bugs in the rats, and then it was people who were,
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:19.880]  then it was euthanasia, that was the next move, and forced euthanasia, and the rationale
[1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:24.560]  for that was compassion, by the way, just so you all know.
[1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:29.680]  It's merciful to put these people who are burdensome to themselves and their families
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:33.120]  and the state who are living second-grade lives.
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:37.720]  It's merciful to euthanize them, and that was a huge campaign in Germany, it was after
[1:58:37.720 --> 1:58:47.040]  that that the more racial purifications began, and so that's the disgusting, that's unbelievably
[1:58:47.040 --> 1:58:54.000]  important, because lots of times people think that conservatives are more anxiety-sensitive.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:57.240]  That is dead-on when he just said, because I've actually read Hitler's writings, I'm
[1:58:57.240 --> 1:59:01.240]  just going to believe mainstream media wouldn't actually look, and it's disgusting, and now
[1:59:01.240 --> 1:59:06.000]  the bioethics boards, they decide if an old person's worth living or a baby, and that's
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:10.240]  why they say, oh, we resuscitate it, they decide to let it live, it's already a lie,
[1:59:10.240 --> 1:59:14.600]  that means it's worth it, that's the new term, and then if baby's comfortable, mama don't
[1:59:14.600 --> 1:59:18.680]  want it, we keep her comfortable, then they take the organs, but they keep it alive a
[1:59:18.680 --> 1:59:23.040]  few weeks while the organs come in, but they say we did not resuscitate, we say it's not
[1:59:23.040 --> 1:59:28.560]  a human, now it's just a creature, in a crib we take care of, we keep comfortable before
[1:59:28.560 --> 1:59:33.120]  we take its organs, and it's all going on, the bottom fell out, we're going to post
[1:59:33.120 --> 1:59:37.680]  this to Band-Aught Video, we'll put the rest of the lecture, tell whoever uploads this
[1:59:37.680 --> 1:59:40.400]  to put the rest of the lecture on the end of that, we'll put it on Band-Aught Video,
[1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:44.040]  so it's all congruent, Jordan Peterson, we'll be right back, stay with us with some new
[1:59:44.040 --> 2:00:10.040]  vaccine news, it's 2 AM, here it is now.

[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:47.800]  promo code ALICE and get it 10% off.
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:00:58.920]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:06.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:09.800]  I've studied how the globalists roll out psychology.
[2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:14.160]  I don't really study any particular version or school of psychology.
[2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:18.960]  I study the real politic of it, how they apply it, how it's
[2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:23.680]  Rally done, the gaslighting, the manipulation, the overloading.
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:27.360]  I mean, I've got all my terms for what they do.
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:34.400]  But what they talk about is normalizing mass death
[2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:36.840]  from vaccines where it just becomes background noise.
[2:01:36.840 --> 2:01:38.080]  OK, your neighbor died.
[2:01:38.080 --> 2:01:39.000]  OK, your friend died.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:45.280]  I mean, I know a lot of people who've taken the COVID vaccines.
[2:01:45.280 --> 2:01:48.800]  It doesn't matter if it's J&J, the viral vector is super deadly.
[2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:50.480]  Doesn't matter if it's the AstraZeneca.
[2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:51.720]  It doesn't matter what it is.
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:55.360]  The Pfizer, the Moderna, they all get deathly ill.
[2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:56.720]  Everybody gets deathly ill.
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:59.400]  I was talking to my personal trainer this morning,
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:03.000]  and his cousin is a big liberal.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:06.240]  And he got super sick out of viral infection.
[2:02:06.240 --> 2:02:08.360]  Had to go to the hospital for three days.
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:10.160]  Almost killed him.
[2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:12.080]  They even said it's a bad vaccine reaction.
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:13.240]  Maybe you shouldn't take it.
[2:02:13.240 --> 2:02:17.240]  The next one, he went and did it and got even sicker.
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:21.040]  He'll take 10 shots a year when they say it.
[2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:22.680]  Because he's gay.
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:24.920]  He said, I'm gay, and I care about the community.
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:26.280]  And you people don't know science.
[2:02:26.280 --> 2:02:29.360]  I'm like, Jim Cook runs death camps, but he's gay.
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:31.880]  It's like, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, I'm gay.
[2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:33.160]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[2:02:33.160 --> 2:02:34.560]  Like, oh my god, you're gay.
[2:02:34.560 --> 2:02:36.800]  It's like you have 50 diplomas or something.
[2:02:36.800 --> 2:02:40.440]  My lord is incredible.
[2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:42.840]  The only cooler is we have a son who's transgender.
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:43.360]  He's a girl.
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:45.560]  We cut his genitals off.
[2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:48.080]  See, that all works.
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:52.320]  So CNN is now shaming Fox News for not holding up
[2:02:52.320 --> 2:02:57.760]  their vaccine identity cards and showing their heroes.
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:02:59.920]  Maybe they'll get the ADL involved.
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:02.120]  How about you take photos about how you're normal
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:04.920]  and how you're eating stuff that's high in vitamin D3
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:08.080]  or zinc or taking supplements and showing studies about it?
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:13.000]  Oh, sorry, only the UN is allowed to tell you
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.080]  there's no hope, only vaccines.
[2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:15.840]  There's no hope.
[2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:20.840]  You can't leave the volcano eruption
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:27.440]  unless you've had your vaccine in St. Vincent.
[2:03:27.440 --> 2:03:30.080]  Or if you're in Chile, hey, sorry, you're 85.
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:32.760]  You came to, oh, I'm sorry, you don't have a smartphone.
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:34.320]  You don't have a COVID passport.
[2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:38.080]  No food for you, old lady.
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:39.800]  Plus, your life's not worth it anymore.
[2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:41.400]  Just go home and starve.
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:42.680]  We're so liberal.
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:46.280]  We've decided your life doesn't have any value.
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:48.240]  We're the bioethics board.
[2:03:48.240 --> 2:03:50.680]  We're virtue signals that while we commit our crimes,
[2:03:50.680 --> 2:03:51.880]  our faces are covered.
[2:03:51.880 --> 2:03:56.160]  It's all esoteric right out of the mind of Satan.
[2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:01.600]  And now there's this.
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:04.520]  Oh, and surprise, surprise.
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:09.120]  Just like DMX, who actually did like the rapper.
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:11.240]  People say it was a big joke online saying,
[2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:13.400]  I'm a white DMX because I guess we kind of
[2:04:13.400 --> 2:04:15.560]  have the same kind of gravelly voice or did.
[2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:17.080]  I'm three years younger than him.
[2:04:17.080 --> 2:04:18.480]  By the way, the family got pissed.
[2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:19.760]  I went and actually tracked it down.
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:23.200]  I mean, he's like, oh, it's just some black website hip hop
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:23.520]  group.
[2:04:23.520 --> 2:04:25.120]  It's not the New York Times saying
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:27.160]  that he had been on drugs in over five years
[2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:29.520]  and he was all healthy and that he took the shot
[2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:33.080]  and died from it because it was available to under 50
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:35.320]  or whatever then.
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:38.200]  So I tracked it down, just like Robert Kennedy Jr.
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:41.000]  tracked it down that Hank Aaron indeed did take the shot.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:42.080]  They didn't do an autopsy.
[2:04:42.080 --> 2:04:43.480]  Family thought he died of the shot,
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:45.280]  took the second shot, was dead a day later.
[2:04:45.280 --> 2:04:48.040]  Marvis Marvin Hagler, his family, his boxing buddies
[2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:50.560]  that were there when he died said he took the second shot.
[2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:52.560]  It was dead a day later.
[2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:55.440]  He was in the hospital and dead a day and a half later.
[2:04:55.440 --> 2:04:58.280]  Well, get lucky here, right here.
[2:04:58.280 --> 2:05:00.080]  And yes, we do have anecdotal evidence.
[2:05:00.080 --> 2:05:01.800]  We have proof the vaccine kills people.
[2:05:01.800 --> 2:05:02.680]  It's not a vaccine.
[2:05:02.680 --> 2:05:04.520]  We have proof it killed all the ferrets they tested it on.
[2:05:04.520 --> 2:05:06.200]  That's why they said, oh, no, animal testing was done.
[2:05:06.200 --> 2:05:07.400]  That's why we're like, what's going on?
[2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:10.360]  Top scientists go, wait a minute.
[2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:11.680]  This is going to hurt people.
[2:05:11.680 --> 2:05:12.760]  Of course it is.
[2:05:12.760 --> 2:05:15.560]  That's the plan.
[2:05:15.560 --> 2:05:20.120]  And the ferrets, it killed him in about two weeks to a month.
[2:05:20.120 --> 2:05:23.440]  We'll see a ferret only lives what, six, seven, eight years?
[2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:24.920]  Dog was about 12, 13.
[2:05:24.920 --> 2:05:26.920]  The cat was about 15.
[2:05:26.920 --> 2:05:31.440]  So they've done the actuaries and looked at it and they said,
[2:05:31.440 --> 2:05:34.160]  this is going to start killing humans in six months to two years.
[2:05:34.160 --> 2:05:36.560]  And it is already.
[2:05:36.560 --> 2:05:41.000]  If you're old, it's going to kill you maybe right away.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:44.240]  And we've had doctors on that said, yeah, I had 22 patients die
[2:05:44.240 --> 2:05:47.520]  in the last month at the nursing homes I visit.
[2:05:47.520 --> 2:05:49.880]  And then we have a real number showing that.
[2:05:49.880 --> 2:05:50.880]  We have that in the news.
[2:05:50.880 --> 2:05:51.880]  It's even there.
[2:05:51.880 --> 2:05:52.880]  They're just getting used to it.
[2:05:52.880 --> 2:05:53.880]  But look at this.
[2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:58.360]  27-year-old resident doctor dies months after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.
[2:05:58.360 --> 2:05:59.880]  It's up on infowars.com.
[2:05:59.880 --> 2:06:01.400]  Oh, and look, he's black.
[2:06:01.400 --> 2:06:02.400]  He's black.
[2:06:02.400 --> 2:06:03.400]  He's black.
[2:06:03.400 --> 2:06:04.400]  He's black.
[2:06:04.400 --> 2:06:05.400]  He's black.
[2:06:05.400 --> 2:06:06.400]  He's black.
[2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:07.400]  He's black.
[2:06:07.400 --> 2:06:15.800]  So we have all the scientific proof that this thing in the vaccine is killing people.
[2:06:15.800 --> 2:06:20.600]  But I've anecdotally noticed that a lot of black people are dying from it, including
[2:06:20.600 --> 2:06:23.520]  people I went to high school with, this guy and his wife.
[2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:24.840]  You want to be a UT football player?
[2:06:24.840 --> 2:06:29.400]  They went and got the shot and they're dead in the hammer.
[2:06:29.400 --> 2:06:30.400]  But that's okay.
[2:06:30.400 --> 2:06:32.720]  It's a liberal.
[2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:34.400]  So let's continue here.
[2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:39.400]  27-year-old resident doctor dies months after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.
[2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:45.520]  27-year-old man, like all these other people that have been dying, who was administering
[2:06:45.520 --> 2:06:46.520]  COVID-19 vaccine.
[2:06:46.520 --> 2:06:52.080]  The Chicago suddenly died just months after he took his second dose of Pfizer shot.
[2:06:52.080 --> 2:06:58.680]  Josh Meir Henry, resident doctor working for PGY1 program pharmacy in Homebolt Park
[2:06:58.680 --> 2:07:04.920]  Health, Chicago, Illinois was honored to be part of administering the second dose, the
[2:07:04.920 --> 2:07:08.920]  Pfizer vaccine to the first five recipients of Chicago.
[2:07:08.920 --> 2:07:10.960]  He was even a star of the whole thing.
[2:07:10.960 --> 2:07:16.920]  While I understand the hesitancy of many regarding receiving the vaccine, I'd like to encourage
[2:07:16.920 --> 2:07:19.000]  all those who qualify to be vaccinated.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:23.840]  Initially, I was also hesitant, but was reassured by some research in clarifying my thought
[2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:24.840]  reading.
[2:07:24.840 --> 2:07:27.400]  Henry wrote in a January Facebook post.
[2:07:27.400 --> 2:07:30.000]  Kind of like that woman complained on Facebook.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  She said, I took it.
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  I can't breathe.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  I'm dying.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  And she did die.
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:38.720]  And Facebook checked her ass and said, lady, it's been tested and it's 100% safe, which
[2:07:38.720 --> 2:07:40.720]  is a damn lie.
[2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:46.840]  But it doesn't matter because I got the chronicle here last week saying we're going to the black
[2:07:46.840 --> 2:07:53.200]  poor neighborhood to help them with a couple cans of beans and a little sign saying COVID
[2:07:53.200 --> 2:07:57.480]  shots are free and they're 100% safe and you need them.
[2:07:57.480 --> 2:08:00.720]  Here, let's look at that right here.
[2:08:00.720 --> 2:08:03.720]  COVID-19 vaccines are safe.
[2:08:03.720 --> 2:08:07.440]  And then Hollywood puts out all these movies about kill white people and a bunch of young
[2:08:07.440 --> 2:08:12.200]  black people led by Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL types go out and start killing and
[2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:15.680]  burning and then whites become a bunch of races against you and that destroys any future
[2:08:15.680 --> 2:08:18.200]  of us working together because they really love you.
[2:08:18.200 --> 2:08:22.200]  They love you to give you that shot and they love you to be a thug and they love you to
[2:08:22.200 --> 2:08:23.200]  die.
[2:08:23.200 --> 2:08:28.640]  If they can't abort you before you're born, they're going to abort you after you're born
[2:08:28.640 --> 2:08:29.880]  and they want to get everybody.
[2:08:29.880 --> 2:08:34.800]  But they've got a special love for black people, a special hate.
[2:08:34.800 --> 2:08:35.800]  So there you go.
[2:08:35.800 --> 2:08:40.640]  But I mean, all this is okay because Silicon Valley, they've got long hair, they wear different
[2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:44.840]  color socks, they're liberal, it's all camouflage.
[2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:48.080]  It's like the pink sweaters.
[2:08:48.080 --> 2:08:49.640]  Imagine if Freddie Krueger wore a pink sweater.
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:52.360]  They're like, oh, go ahead and kill me, Freddie, you're wearing a pink sweater.
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:53.360]  Or Jason wore one.
[2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:54.360]  See, it's the same deal.
[2:08:54.360 --> 2:08:56.360]  They're like, oh, Jason, you're wearing a pink sweater.
[2:08:56.360 --> 2:09:00.080]  I mean, you're not about to kill me or anything with a machete.
[2:09:00.080 --> 2:09:07.080]  I mean, it's so obvious, so ridiculous.
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:08.080]  And they're attacking everybody.
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:09.360]  We're all supposed to kill each other.
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:14.800]  Guys, can you pull up from Russia with love, the opening scene with the Simon's fighting
[2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:15.800]  fish?
[2:09:15.800 --> 2:09:18.120]  And they go, oh, notice the fish.
[2:09:18.120 --> 2:09:21.840]  The two fish fight each other, one dies, the other gets sick in a week, and then the other
[2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:25.400]  one swoops in to kill the other.
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:26.400]  And that's divide and conquer.
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:31.800]  And we just sit here like morons, banging our head into a wall like total idiots and
[2:09:31.800 --> 2:09:32.800]  letting this win.
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:34.640]  Just bang, bang, bang.
[2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:37.440]  Or we could just wake up in the New World Order, read what the enemy's doing, say no
[2:09:37.440 --> 2:09:38.440]  to them and stop them.
[2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:41.000]  Oh, but we don't want to admit we're under an attack.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:42.800]  We don't want to admit we're being scammed.
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:44.600]  It's too much fun to be morons.
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:49.440]  Oh, my gosh, I got so much more to get to, but I just, there's all this breaking news
[2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:50.440]  here.
[2:09:50.440 --> 2:09:51.960]  I want to get into the whole race riding.
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:56.240]  I want to get into the war with Russia thing next to the Nezvold van on the just completely
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:10:00.720]  dystopic nightmare footage of hundreds of riot police pushing and people out and attacking
[2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:03.320]  people for being an outdoor church service now.
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:07.720]  I mean, it is just, it's insane.
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:10.720]  And please remember, we put it all in the film in game and I've always got the meter
[2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:11.720]  running.
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:16.520]  I'm going to put it down if you don't find us, plus this is a video you need back in
[2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:19.680]  stock in game blubber for global enslavement, the film that exposed it all.
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:22.800]  We've launched operation in game, stopped the great reset.
[2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:26.960]  One copy for 1495, two copies for 995 each.
[2:10:26.960 --> 2:10:32.480]  And then it just goes down to 395 when each, when you get 10 of the films.
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:34.240]  And it's also a zero country codes.
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:37.480]  Everybody can copy this, burn copies, tell people, hey, it's the forbidden info.
[2:10:37.480 --> 2:10:40.400]  It's a film of predicted at all, one of the truth within game, you're not supposed to
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:41.400]  see it.
[2:10:41.400 --> 2:10:45.040]  They'll fix it, they'll wake up, they'll make copies and pay it forward, infowarstore.com,
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:48.160]  get in game today.
[2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:56.160]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[2:10:56.160 --> 2:11:00.640]  And they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:04.080]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:07.040]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:10.840]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:15.560]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:21.320]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the
[2:11:21.320 --> 2:11:27.560]  lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:28.560]  the info war.
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:33.040]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get
[2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:34.040]  from them.
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:38.040]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again, because the globalists
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:40.480]  are destroying what was open and what was free.
[2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:47.960]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there, infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[2:11:47.960 --> 2:11:52.560]  It's hard to believe that we're already in the middle of April and our borders collapsing
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:56.840]  and world governments being announced that Joe Biden's coming after our guns and trying
[2:11:56.840 --> 2:12:01.520]  to start a war with Russia, but told China they could take over Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:06.960]  So China's done a blockade around Taiwan and is threatening to invade Hong Kong.
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:09.320]  They already sent troops into Hong Kong.
[2:12:09.320 --> 2:12:14.000]  This is madness and our government's been hijacked now by these globalists and they're
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  trying to shut us down.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:20.800]  They took their sponsors away a long time ago, but you sponsor us by buying products
[2:12:20.800 --> 2:12:21.800]  direct.

[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:37.160]  So it was a critical time and issue with all those crazy things happening.
[2:12:37.160 --> 2:12:40.400]  I want to thank you all for your support and remind you these are products you and your
[2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:44.400]  family already need and they fund the info war, a true 360 win.

[2:12:51.200 --> 2:13:12.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:14.880]  So China is the golden child.
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:19.280]  China is where the Rockefellers, the newer war, the Rothschilds set up the deals where
[2:13:19.280 --> 2:13:24.120]  they have all the industry, all the jobs, all the weapons, all our secrets.
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:29.920]  Russia has its own authoritarian problems, but it has been isolated and dominated and
[2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:33.640]  controlled because they kicked the globalist out in 1991.
[2:13:33.640 --> 2:13:37.200]  They've had their own human problems, their own corruption and I'm not saying Russia hasn't
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:41.600]  tried to spy on us or infiltrate us just compared to the new world order.
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:48.320]  You know, Russia just is not even on the scale of active anti-human evil and they've been
[2:13:48.320 --> 2:13:53.400]  reversing the anti-family programs, the transgenderism, all of it, and the whole Hollywood system
[2:13:53.400 --> 2:13:57.880]  that had Russia where they wanted it is super pissed.
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:04.240]  And so on record, Ukraine, since George Soros bragged them for Ezekarius seven years ago,
[2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:09.440]  six years ago, launched major military attacks on the police, caused race riots again, said,
[2:14:09.440 --> 2:14:10.440]  well, what's the race?
[2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:11.440]  They're all white.
[2:14:11.440 --> 2:14:16.960]  Well, Catholic versus Orthodox vice versa, so it was religious ethnic because they still
[2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:19.160]  see it as an ethnic deal.
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:22.840]  One side is Russian, the Orthodox the other side is more in line with the Germans and
[2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:25.640]  the Poles historically and they're Catholic.
[2:14:25.640 --> 2:14:29.720]  And so a lot of wars have started there, but 80% of Eastern Ukraine is Russian and their
[2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:35.600]  big gas pipelines come into supply Europe with gas and oil.
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:37.640]  That's all Russia's really got.
[2:14:37.640 --> 2:14:40.160]  And so they will defend their strategic interest.
[2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:45.240]  And so now Biden says it was an uncharacteristic Sunday emergency meeting of what to do and
[2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:51.320]  so the Secretary of State, you'll said everybody's fly for them by the Chinese, you know, Russia
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:52.320]  better watch out.
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:56.440]  We'll have military action will strong response.
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:15:00.560]  And when he did that, the Russians even put more troops on the border and put their nuclear
[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:08.360]  forces on alert and everything because there are Ukrainian troops on record sniping, shooting,
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:10.600]  bombing, and firing artillery.
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:12.760]  This is on even German.
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:15.960]  This is any Polish finish, but not on US news.
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:23.360]  You're like, yeah, I mean, the Russians for no reason are massing troops and you've got
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:27.920]  the Ukrainian president up there in combat year going, oh, we need help.
[2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:30.560]  The Russians are about to attack.
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:35.160]  So it's all 88 2008 on the eight month.
[2:15:35.160 --> 2:15:41.000]  Remember when the whole Olympics started and to embarrass Russia over all that, there was
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:47.280]  a attack launched into Georgia into Russia and the Russians repulsed it, pulled back
[2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:49.960]  and the media's like, Russia attack Georgia.
[2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:54.120]  And I was following foreign news, even British news admitted that the Ukrainians attack
[2:15:54.120 --> 2:15:57.280]  Russian held areas in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
[2:15:57.280 --> 2:15:59.440]  I mean, you know, two plus two equals four.
[2:15:59.440 --> 2:16:00.440]  I'm not a Russophile.
[2:16:00.440 --> 2:16:06.560]  I'm a human file, a freedom file, a Jesus file and I love freedom and I love surviving
[2:16:06.560 --> 2:16:08.160]  and not blowing the earth up.
[2:16:08.160 --> 2:16:12.160]  And so if the Russians make any provocative moves, I'm against it.
[2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:13.800]  They cut their defense budget.
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:16.120]  They're totally surrounded.
[2:16:16.120 --> 2:16:21.320]  And now because the Ukrainians are rolling weapons up the border, the Russians are rolling
[2:16:21.320 --> 2:16:22.320]  weapons up the border.
[2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:24.200]  What do you think they're going to do?
[2:16:24.200 --> 2:16:30.680]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, with a Biden, not a good time.
[2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:31.680]  Here's some of the headlines.
[2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:38.480]  Putin admin threatens consequences against Russia for military buildup in Ukraine.
[2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:42.640]  One of the few things Trump did trying to prove he wasn't a Russian agent was start
[2:16:42.640 --> 2:16:46.800]  giving any tank missiles and tanks to the Ukrainians and attack helicopters.
[2:16:46.800 --> 2:16:48.400]  And now that's accelerated here.
[2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:53.960]  And so all these tough guy, you know, liberal women that were the pants in their house,
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:16:59.200]  now they're about to show Putin right now how big in bed they are and probably blow
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:00.200]  the planet up.
[2:17:00.200 --> 2:17:06.920]  There's no end to it, but oh, after Biden, you know, that's what this is, the Biden administration.
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:07.920]  Oh, comes first.
[2:17:07.920 --> 2:17:08.920]  He's the charge.
[2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:14.880]  Like Obama's the real president, then Biden's the front man, and then Kamala's this little
[2:17:14.880 --> 2:17:17.280]  thing that swarms around over here.
[2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:22.560]  But they're the ones that move the troops in.
[2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:23.760]  They're the ones that master troops.
[2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:25.720]  They're the ones that have been doing all this.
[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:26.720]  And the left just loves it.
[2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:30.280]  It's like, oh, yeah, sexy war with the Russians, because they're Christians now.
[2:17:30.280 --> 2:17:33.960]  People go, oh, Russia's faking that it's Christian, but no, they're not, Hollywood wants to blow
[2:17:33.960 --> 2:17:34.960]  it up.
[2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:39.440]  And if you look at the Trotskyites, if you look at the neocons that hate Russia, they're
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:43.080]  the ones that were kicked out of Russia.
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:48.280]  And so they've got a big hard on for Russia because they had Russia down where they wanted
[2:17:48.280 --> 2:17:49.280]  it.
[2:17:49.280 --> 2:17:52.600]  They had Russia where they wanted it, and now they don't.
[2:17:52.600 --> 2:17:55.000]  So let's all pray for peace.
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:18:01.080]  The globalists are certainly accelerating us into war, while Biden, this is the key,
[2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:05.480]  told China a month and a half ago and CNN, go ahead and invade Hong Kong, Taiwan, go
[2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:08.720]  ahead and kill the Uyghurs, it's your right to do it.
[2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:09.720]  Wow.
[2:18:09.720 --> 2:18:10.720]  Wow.
[2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:17.960]  That reminds me of Stalin appeasing Hitler before World War II kicked off between Russia
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:23.400]  and Germany, because that was the real war.
[2:18:23.400 --> 2:18:28.480]  All the other stuff was big and important, and half million Brits died, 400,000 Americans
[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:32.920]  died, and we had big battles everywhere, but you know, 22 million Germans died, 20 million
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:33.920]  Russians.
[2:18:33.920 --> 2:18:38.080]  I mean, World War II was the Russians and the Germans literally murdering a third of
[2:18:38.080 --> 2:18:41.760]  each other.
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:47.600]  And now, once again, the European dictator, and that's what Biden is, is just a European
[2:18:47.600 --> 2:18:52.680]  globalist thing, is now trying to start a war with Russia because they really haven't
[2:18:52.680 --> 2:18:53.680]  ever won there.
[2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:57.480]  They kind of socially put in communist, killed a bunch of Christians, kind of had their way
[2:18:57.480 --> 2:19:02.080]  for a while, but damn it, Stalin came in and kicked the Trotskyites out.
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:05.840]  And Stalin was a bad guy, I'm just saying, they really have been pissed, but they always
[2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:09.920]  had hopes of getting them back down on the ground again.
[2:19:09.920 --> 2:19:13.600]  And so all of this is the globalists fighting the wars they lost.
[2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:17.680]  The globalists are mad at Christians existing, they're mad at America existing, they're mad
[2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:22.480]  at our success, they want us beat.
[2:19:22.480 --> 2:19:31.480]  And that's all any of this is, and that's all any of it ever will be.
[2:19:31.480 --> 2:19:42.600]  So the world is in extreme grave danger right now, and it's very serious.
[2:19:42.600 --> 2:19:49.600]  And I just cannot stress that enough to anybody that we are in extreme peril.
[2:19:49.600 --> 2:19:54.320]  Israel event is scheduled, he heads up rebel media to join us, but you haven't seen the
[2:19:54.320 --> 2:19:59.280]  footage of your TV, we're going to be playing it, it is Tiananmen Square-esque.
[2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:04.040]  I mean, you could overuse that term or hit Larian, people overuse it, but I mean, when
[2:20:04.040 --> 2:20:07.120]  the shoe fits, it fits.
[2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:17.080]  Riot police marching in at this church and shutting it down and then pushing people out.
[2:20:17.080 --> 2:20:19.120]  That is all coming up next segment.
[2:20:19.120 --> 2:20:22.040]  Okay, separately, let me throw this out at you.
[2:20:22.040 --> 2:20:25.520]  The New World Order is on everything they can to suppress knowledge about what our bodies
[2:20:25.520 --> 2:20:26.520]  need.
[2:20:26.520 --> 2:20:28.640]  We need oxygen, we need water.
[2:20:28.640 --> 2:20:34.280]  Plants need carbon dioxide, but they know that the public thinks carbon dioxide sounds
[2:20:34.280 --> 2:20:38.120]  scary so the UN has announced its toxic gas, the Rothschilds are going to tax it.
[2:20:38.120 --> 2:20:41.720]  I expect they'll say vitamin C is poison or vitamin D3 is poison next.
[2:20:41.720 --> 2:20:45.440]  They don't want you having basic building blocks you need to be healthy and be alive.

[2:21:47.160 --> 2:21:52.960]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes info
[2:21:52.960 --> 2:21:53.960]  wars has had.
[2:21:53.960 --> 2:22:01.080]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together but I'll tell you this, the
[2:22:01.080 --> 2:22:06.040]  technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent
[2:22:06.040 --> 2:22:11.320]  forms of media, they're trying to shutter and silence the human resistance so now is
[2:22:11.320 --> 2:22:16.040]  the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate, everything
[2:22:16.040 --> 2:22:19.000]  you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:24.040]  So it's now that your credibility is way up, the power structure is going to silence those
[2:22:24.040 --> 2:22:30.760]  of us that they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:22:30.760 --> 2:22:36.800]  We have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:41.120]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't
[2:22:41.120 --> 2:22:47.800]  come so be the polar bears you are.
[2:22:47.800 --> 2:22:53.160]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something,
[2:22:53.160 --> 2:22:57.520]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[2:22:57.520 --> 2:23:01.800]  the years and it's truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:02.800]  you the listeners of this show.
[2:23:02.800 --> 2:23:05.960]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[2:23:05.960 --> 2:23:09.600]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter you got red
[2:23:09.600 --> 2:23:14.200]  blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we
[2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:19.480]  are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work
[2:23:19.480 --> 2:23:23.720]  with you over the years and as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future
[2:23:23.720 --> 2:23:27.680]  but again that's really up to you and up to God.
[2:23:27.680 --> 2:23:32.360]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us
[2:23:32.360 --> 2:23:35.080]  but again that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[2:23:35.080 --> 2:23:38.680]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[2:23:38.680 --> 2:23:44.200]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully
[2:23:44.200 --> 2:23:46.640]  God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse.
[2:23:46.640 --> 2:23:47.640]  God bless.
[2:23:47.640 --> 2:23:53.000]  I am a very humble person but I am also a bold person and so as bad as things are with
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:56.720]  the globalist attacking humanity and all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want
[2:23:56.720 --> 2:24:01.160]  you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[2:24:01.160 --> 2:24:04.760]  I'm a public figure so I get to see things that no public doesn't get to see and let
[2:24:04.760 --> 2:24:10.360]  me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood
[2:24:10.360 --> 2:24:16.240]  or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[2:24:16.240 --> 2:24:21.240]  They don't want to go along with the globalists but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[2:24:21.240 --> 2:24:23.800]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:28.120]  You fund us, you support M4store.com, you get rape policy at the same time.
[2:24:28.120 --> 2:24:33.080]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular but the globalist will target
[2:24:33.080 --> 2:24:37.920]  you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:43.280]  That's our job so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we can be the
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:45.800]  shock groups in the information war.
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:47.880]  Fund us at M4store.com.
[2:24:47.880 --> 2:24:52.200]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet.
[2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:55.360]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have
[2:24:55.360 --> 2:24:57.080]  a lot of credibility but I don't care about that.
[2:24:57.080 --> 2:25:01.040]  I care about beating the new world order and it's because we have so much credibility,
[2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:05.200]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and I don't have time to tell you all the
[2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:07.160]  stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:10.800]  I can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:15.760]  the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us and please
[2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:20.600]  buy the products at M4store.com, they're great products plus they fund the operation.
[2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:23.760]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:24.760]  Do they fund freedom?
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:25.760]  No, a lot of them don't.
[2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:30.440]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[2:25:30.440 --> 2:25:32.240]  up and looking for truth.
[2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:33.880]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:25:33.880 --> 2:25:37.320]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:40.800]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:44.240]  Download everything we've done, you can find and save it because who knows how long we're
[2:25:44.240 --> 2:25:50.560]  going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:25:50.560 --> 2:26:16.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:26:16.560 --> 2:26:46.520]  I appreciate Ezra Levant, founder and the head of Rebel Media.
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:47.520]  Coming on.
[2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:50.360]  His reporters have been the very tip of the spear.
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:55.880]  You know, last week we had one of his reporters on showing this big Edmonton, Alberta main
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:27:01.880]  line church, shut down the Walmart down the street, open, sorry, you can't open.
[2:27:01.880 --> 2:27:02.880]  Churches are non-essential.
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:03.880]  Walmart is essential.
[2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:08.600]  This is just as bad as Australia or Spain or the UK.
[2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:12.560]  So they said no, then they put a fence up around it, hundreds of police there, first
[2:27:12.560 --> 2:27:16.920]  about 50 police and private security, then hundreds of riot police yesterday.
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:22.400]  I saw this footage will start rolling now and I caught my breath last night because
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:28.560]  I was already on the show when the website updated and it showed this footage at dusk,
[2:27:28.560 --> 2:27:34.440]  the armed police and their mask marching in and rough housing, like a thousand plus people
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:38.080]  there, just incredible footage that Rebel Media got.
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:42.880]  This isn't ISIS or El Nuzra blowing up churches in the Middle East or Africa.
[2:27:42.880 --> 2:27:45.760]  This isn't the Islamists in the Philippines doing that.
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:48.960]  This isn't China going in and writing the churches and closing them.
[2:27:48.960 --> 2:27:53.840]  This is Canada and then all over the U.S. it's still happening that they're openly against
[2:27:53.840 --> 2:27:54.840]  churches, synagogues.
[2:27:54.840 --> 2:27:59.720]  They believe in mosque alone, I've noticed, but they've been targeting in Israel, Hasidic
[2:27:59.720 --> 2:28:03.360]  and Orthodox Jews have been shut down.
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:05.160]  Ezra Levant, what is going on?
[2:28:05.160 --> 2:28:11.040]  This is all unified globally from Australia, to Israel, to Europe, to the U.S., to Canada.
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:14.080]  What is going on and what is the latest on this church?
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:19.640]  Yeah, well, thank you for interviewing my colleague, our chief reporter, Sheila Gunn
[2:28:19.640 --> 2:28:21.200]  Reid, last week.
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:27.280]  She has been on the scene of this Grace Life Church every weekend for, I think, coming
[2:28:27.280 --> 2:28:29.120]  up on two months now.
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:33.680]  She's earned the trust of the church, so she's the only journalist that they talk to because
[2:28:33.680 --> 2:28:38.200]  the media party, as I call it, just lies about this church.
[2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:41.240]  So I rely on Sheila for the straight goods.
[2:28:41.240 --> 2:28:44.240]  And here's what happened on the weekend.
[2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:50.120]  As you know, mid-week, last week, this church that had been targeted by the government,
[2:28:50.120 --> 2:28:56.480]  the pastor had been thrown in prison for 35 days because he would not close the church
[2:28:56.480 --> 2:28:57.480]  doors.
[2:28:57.480 --> 2:29:03.480]  They let the pastor out, so they assumed that the church would be going full tilt.
[2:29:03.480 --> 2:29:10.480]  So at a dawn raid, police came onto the church property, erected a fence around it, a riot
[2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:17.120]  style fence, and set up a permanent paramilitary garrison on the church property because if
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:22.520]  they just put a fence on or just changed the locks, they thought that the church members
[2:29:22.520 --> 2:29:24.440]  would just take the fence down and go in.
[2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:30.960]  So they have established the equivalent of a permanent police station or military outpost.
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:36.440]  I don't know what you want to call it, and they have 24-hour-a-day patrols.
[2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:41.200]  They have buses bringing fresh recruits in to replace the others.
[2:29:41.200 --> 2:29:47.120]  They set up latrines, portable toilets as close to the sanctuary as they could.
[2:29:47.120 --> 2:29:48.120]  It's so gross.
[2:29:48.120 --> 2:29:49.120]  And by the way, for radio listeners, we're not joking.
[2:29:49.120 --> 2:29:54.560]  We're talking a huge fence around this big church, hundreds of police, hundreds of riot
[2:29:54.560 --> 2:30:01.280]  police, in Darth Vader outfits, like stopping Christians is stopping the most evil thing
[2:30:01.280 --> 2:30:02.780]  on earth.
[2:30:02.780 --> 2:30:06.960]  I've attended, I went to this church about three or four weeks ago.
[2:30:06.960 --> 2:30:09.960]  I wanted to see it with my own eyes.
[2:30:09.960 --> 2:30:10.960]  What are they like?
[2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:12.960]  What's their temperament?
[2:30:12.960 --> 2:30:15.120]  And I should say they're very peaceful.
[2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:18.880]  They truly live that motto, turn the other cheek.
[2:30:18.880 --> 2:30:19.880]  It was so wonderful.
[2:30:19.880 --> 2:30:23.160]  There were lots of kids and babies and pregnant moms.
[2:30:23.160 --> 2:30:26.600]  It was so friendly, I'm not even Christian, by the way, I'm Jewish.
[2:30:26.600 --> 2:30:29.520]  And I felt so much love and belonging and friendship there.
[2:30:29.520 --> 2:30:32.840]  I said to them, if I lived in Edmonton, I'd go every week.
[2:30:32.840 --> 2:30:34.640]  So these are the nicest people.
[2:30:34.640 --> 2:30:36.360]  And remember the pastor?
[2:30:36.360 --> 2:30:40.200]  He was jailed simply because he refused to close his church.
[2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:42.600]  He could have gotten out of jail in a second.
[2:30:42.600 --> 2:30:45.760]  And as I keep pinching myself, this is really happening.
[2:30:45.760 --> 2:30:49.440]  You really have a prime minister that said, I want a dictatorship like China.
[2:30:49.440 --> 2:30:50.960]  What the hell's going on here?
[2:30:50.960 --> 2:30:56.440]  Well, and here's the thing, so the pastor was out of his 35-day prison term in a maximum
[2:30:56.440 --> 2:30:58.080]  security facility.
[2:30:58.080 --> 2:31:02.440]  The church, you know, packed every weekend, so the cops, yeah, there's Sheila talking
[2:31:02.440 --> 2:31:05.480]  to the pastor right there, but you can see the fence around it.
[2:31:05.480 --> 2:31:10.720]  They've put their latrines as close to the sanctuary as possible to file the place.
[2:31:10.720 --> 2:31:11.720]  It's so gross.
[2:31:11.720 --> 2:31:12.720]  So this weekend, what happened?
[2:31:12.720 --> 2:31:15.280]  Well, two things happened.
[2:31:15.280 --> 2:31:21.520]  One is the actual church congregants, you're not going to believe this, Alex.
[2:31:21.520 --> 2:31:24.720]  They went to a secret location.
[2:31:24.720 --> 2:31:28.000]  They had what is called an underground church.
[2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:33.600]  That's a phrase you've probably heard from China or from some parts in the Middle East,
[2:31:33.600 --> 2:31:37.040]  where being a Christian means the police will hunt you.
[2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:45.080]  In Canada, in 2021, there was a secret underground church service not at this site.
[2:31:45.080 --> 2:31:46.560]  It wasn't from the police.
[2:31:46.560 --> 2:31:51.640]  So the actual pastor and congregants were at a secret underground church.
[2:31:51.640 --> 2:31:58.800]  But that said, close to a thousand other supporters of the church showed up out of solidarity.
[2:31:58.800 --> 2:32:01.600]  And that's what was particularly interesting.
[2:32:01.600 --> 2:32:06.120]  Police blocked the road so they couldn't get access, so they couldn't park.
[2:32:06.120 --> 2:32:07.760]  People showed up anyways.
[2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:08.760]  Some people started...
[2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:09.760]  Let's be clear.
[2:32:09.760 --> 2:32:12.480]  They wanted to frustrate the free speech of showing the solidarity.
[2:32:12.480 --> 2:32:14.960]  There's nothing to do with viruses, it's all about power.
[2:32:14.960 --> 2:32:18.000]  We can shut down churches, we can do anything we want.
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  That's a keen observation that public health order only applies to the premises of the
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:24.080]  church.
[2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:27.800]  Not shutting down the roads around it, that's got nothing to do with the virus.
[2:32:27.800 --> 2:32:29.640]  That's about political control.
[2:32:29.640 --> 2:32:34.800]  Despite the political control on the highways, about 800 people showed up.
[2:32:34.800 --> 2:32:40.480]  Now some of them were singing hymns and prayers and were trying to, in fact, sort of convert
[2:32:40.480 --> 2:32:41.800]  the cops.
[2:32:41.800 --> 2:32:47.080]  These were a little more rambunctious and they pushed down the outer realm of the other ring
[2:32:47.080 --> 2:32:48.080]  of the fence.
[2:32:48.080 --> 2:32:49.080]  It's like a little military base.
[2:32:49.080 --> 2:32:52.600]  You've got the outer perimeter, you've got an inner perimeter, you've got, you know,
[2:32:52.600 --> 2:32:53.600]  so some...
[2:32:53.600 --> 2:32:55.520]  They have literally occupied this church.
[2:32:55.520 --> 2:33:00.880]  Yeah, it's a permanent occupation until the pandemic is over because they know if they
[2:33:00.880 --> 2:33:02.960]  leave, people will go back in.
[2:33:02.960 --> 2:33:03.960]  Imagine the amount of money.
[2:33:03.960 --> 2:33:08.040]  Why do you think Trudeau and the regional governor are doing this?
[2:33:08.040 --> 2:33:13.120]  I think they're doing it because of the moral example of courage that this pastor and his
[2:33:13.120 --> 2:33:14.680]  church are showing.
[2:33:14.680 --> 2:33:15.680]  But here's the thing.
[2:33:15.680 --> 2:33:16.680]  And you showed those...
[2:33:16.680 --> 2:33:18.700]  Yeah, so here's some Christians.
[2:33:18.700 --> 2:33:20.280]  This is footage from our Sheila Gunnery.
[2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:23.600]  They were singing prayers very beautifully, very peacefully.
[2:33:23.600 --> 2:33:26.320]  So this was one sort of group approach to look at them.
[2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:30.880]  I mean, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, these are not actually the congregants.
[2:33:30.880 --> 2:33:34.800]  These are people in solidarity who were defying the public health order.
[2:33:34.800 --> 2:33:38.600]  Now there were some folks who, this wasn't enough, they tried to knock down the fences,
[2:33:38.600 --> 2:33:42.560]  but the peaceful, like there was two, I guess, different factions.
[2:33:42.560 --> 2:33:44.120]  These folks said, no, no, no.
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:46.040]  If we wanted to retake this church, we could.
[2:33:46.040 --> 2:33:47.040]  That's not the point.
[2:33:47.040 --> 2:33:48.040]  We just want to pray.
[2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:51.880]  So that, like I say, there's an underground church in the Edmonton area in this location.
[2:33:51.880 --> 2:33:53.840]  And I agree we should be peaceful at this point.
[2:33:53.840 --> 2:33:58.200]  But at some point when the state comes and sets down churches with guns, I mean, they're
[2:33:58.200 --> 2:33:59.200]  really asking for it.
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:02.600]  Because, yeah, that thousand people wanted to deal with the 200 cops, they would win
[2:34:02.600 --> 2:34:03.600]  the fight.
[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:04.600]  What is the government thinking?
[2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:05.600]  Why is they doing this?
[2:34:05.600 --> 2:34:06.600]  Well, I don't know.
[2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:11.160]  And put up that footage of the black clothes police, some of them in riot gear, some with
[2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:12.160]  gas masks.
[2:34:12.160 --> 2:34:13.520]  Like Darth Vader marching against them.
[2:34:13.520 --> 2:34:14.520]  Show that.
[2:34:14.520 --> 2:34:15.680]  Then imagine this peaceful crowd.
[2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:16.680]  Yeah.
[2:34:16.680 --> 2:34:18.840]  So you've got a peaceful crowd and then look at them coming.
[2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:22.120]  They were in a staging area, not far by.
[2:34:22.120 --> 2:34:23.240]  And what was their plan?
[2:34:23.240 --> 2:34:25.400]  Were they going to shoot those men, women and children?
[2:34:25.400 --> 2:34:30.520]  Like when you have police with guns, that tells us that you're expecting, contemplating
[2:34:30.520 --> 2:34:32.040]  a certain outcome.
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:33.480]  Waco style.
[2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:39.120]  Now what are you doing deploying 200 Waco style security with heavy, like these are
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:40.120]  mountains.
[2:34:40.120 --> 2:34:42.240]  This is the SWAT team.
[2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:46.120]  What on earth are you doing unless you're looking for a conflict?
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:51.280]  And what the hell is going on in a country like Canada that's supposed to be free?
[2:34:51.280 --> 2:34:53.600]  So you can see some folks were pushing the fences here.
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:34:56.320]  Now there was no shooting, but you could see there's young people, there's women.
[2:34:56.320 --> 2:35:00.360]  Well, they're not pushing up against the tank in, in, in, in, uh, Tim and Square.
[2:35:00.360 --> 2:35:01.360]  We come back.
[2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:04.200]  We have another appointment soon as a little man, but I want to ask you about where this
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:05.200]  is going.
[2:35:05.200 --> 2:35:06.200]  What do you think we should do lawfully, legally?
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:08.720]  I know you've been legally battling this a lot.
[2:35:08.720 --> 2:35:11.000]  We got 30 seconds.
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:12.200]  What else should we do?
[2:35:12.200 --> 2:35:15.600]  Well, I think number one is this is the moment.
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:17.080]  Don't wait folks.
[2:35:17.080 --> 2:35:19.080]  Don't fight in the last ditch.
[2:35:19.080 --> 2:35:20.320]  Fight in the first ditch.
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:23.120]  And by fight, I mean stand and be counted.
[2:35:23.120 --> 2:35:27.720]  Take off your mask, go to church and say, I'm just not complying anymore.
[2:35:27.720 --> 2:35:29.480]  Peaceful non-compliance.
[2:35:29.480 --> 2:35:34.040]  Um, because if you don't do it now, this concrete will, will set like cement.
[2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:35.280]  It's hardening.
[2:35:35.280 --> 2:35:40.280]  If you don't protest now, you won't have a chance a year from now.
[2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:41.280]  Beautifully said.
[2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:44.000]  Ezra Levant will be right back with one more segment with him and Owen Troyer from the
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  Texas border lives.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  They will.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:48.040]  It's very simple.
[2:35:48.040 --> 2:35:52.560]  Every household, not just in America, but worldwide, should be taking a high quality
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:35:57.920]  multivitamin mineral every single day, but so many of the big brands are synthetics that
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:02.560]  are not even absorbed, in fact, in many cases are toxic, but the vitamin mineral fusion

[2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:55.520]  In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[2:36:55.520 --> 2:37:00.240]  Before I had an access to a show in the mid-1990s, I wouldn't saw that movie and thought, man,
[2:37:00.240 --> 2:37:01.240]  that was fun.
[2:37:01.240 --> 2:37:05.880]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[2:37:05.880 --> 2:37:06.880]  because you're real.
[2:37:06.880 --> 2:37:08.920]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[2:37:08.920 --> 2:37:09.920]  We're not worthy!
[2:37:09.920 --> 2:37:10.920]  We're not worthy!
[2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:12.920]  We're not worthy!
[2:37:12.920 --> 2:37:16.880]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you, because
[2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:20.000]  these topics are so huge, they're so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:22.160]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[2:37:22.160 --> 2:37:27.800]  The globalists love lying to you, they love manipulating you, they enjoy destroying humanity,
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:32.600]  they enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[2:37:32.600 --> 2:37:35.080]  That for me is really such a disgusting.
[2:37:35.080 --> 2:37:41.200]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole M4Wars crew that we will never join
[2:37:41.200 --> 2:37:48.000]  the globalists, we will never knowingly manipulate you, because we know we're all in this together.
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  History has been domesticated by and large, the population has been trained to submit,
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:55.680]  do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[2:37:55.680 --> 2:37:59.480]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[2:37:59.480 --> 2:38:03.640]  a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being cold, being
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:04.640]  totally enslaved.
[2:38:04.640 --> 2:38:08.440]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:09.440]  that move.
[2:38:09.440 --> 2:38:13.480]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[2:38:13.480 --> 2:38:19.160]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:24.080]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:29.760]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:34.360]  change as the UN at Klaus Schwabber is saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:40.360]  year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:46.200]  get more IMF and World Bank money, and that's why we have to really get educated about the
[2:38:46.200 --> 2:38:47.200]  globalist.
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:55.400]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:38:59.880]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging
[2:38:59.880 --> 2:39:03.320]  in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[2:39:03.320 --> 2:39:06.320]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:10.120]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:14.840]  want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:20.600]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the
[2:39:20.600 --> 2:39:26.840]  lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[2:39:26.840 --> 2:39:27.840]  the info war.
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:32.320]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get
[2:39:32.320 --> 2:39:33.320]  from them.
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:37.320]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again, because the globalists
[2:39:37.320 --> 2:39:39.760]  are destroying what was open and what was free.
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:44.640]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[2:39:44.640 --> 2:40:10.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:10.640 --> 2:40:38.280]  So the dividends definitely were weird, but they could have picked up crush anytime in
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:42.480]  town, but the new ATF Ed was there and helped murder them and helped pose with their dead
[2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:44.200]  bodies over the rubble.
[2:40:44.200 --> 2:40:48.880]  And he now openly brags he's evolving fast and furious, truly sick.
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:53.480]  Ezra LeVance got to go in a few minutes to a deadline, but I wanted him to just finish
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:58.000]  up on where he thinks this is going as a broadcaster, as a parent, as a citizen of Canada.
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:01.040]  This is all over the world though, the same attack on churches.
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:04.320]  Why are they doing something so authoritarian, so bold?
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:09.320]  Why are they going into Catholic churches and Protestant churches in England and shutting
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:13.360]  them down but letting Black Lives Matter and Antifa burn down cities?
[2:41:13.360 --> 2:41:14.360]  What's happening?
[2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:21.600]  Yeah, we've also noticed by the way, both in New York City and in the Orthodox Jewish
[2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:26.880]  communities in Montreal, that they pick on the very religious Jews.
[2:41:26.880 --> 2:41:31.920]  So what's the commonality between the church that we were talking about in Edmonton, Orthodox
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:32.920]  Jews?
[2:41:32.920 --> 2:41:34.440]  What's the commonality?
[2:41:34.440 --> 2:41:43.360]  Well, they are not willing to substitute a secular politician as their North Star, as
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:45.960]  the be all and end all of their lives.
[2:41:45.960 --> 2:41:51.480]  There are some things that they will not grant to Pharaoh or to Caesar, there's some things
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:54.560]  that they reserve to God.
[2:41:54.560 --> 2:42:00.600]  And the reason why I believe authorities around the world are targeting religious institutions
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:06.240]  is because if you believe in something higher than your prime minister, your public health
[2:42:06.240 --> 2:42:11.720]  officer, if there's someone higher in your moral authority than Anthony Fauci, then you
[2:42:11.720 --> 2:42:15.520]  won't do literally everything he says, especially if it's crazy.
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:21.440]  Like saying you can't go to a church but you can go to a cathedral of commerce like Costco
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:22.440]  or Walmart.
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:30.140]  So they're taking on people who have a, let's say, an immunity to a natural immunity that
[2:42:30.140 --> 2:42:35.600]  comes from their faith to the superstition of lockdownism.
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:37.480]  You're supposed to wear a mask.
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:44.280]  That's sort of like a religious accoutrement, like an Orthodox Jew might wear a yarmulke,
[2:42:44.280 --> 2:42:46.800]  like a Muslim woman might wear a hijab.
[2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:53.400]  If you're a believer in the lockdown superstition, you wear a mask to show your obedience and
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:54.400]  compliance.
[2:42:54.400 --> 2:42:55.880]  It's like a flag of the superstition.
[2:42:55.880 --> 2:43:01.840]  They're trying to supplant, replace, displace other belief systems and there's a heaven
[2:43:01.840 --> 2:43:07.360]  and a hell and a, you know, there's so many, you know, in terms of public health, they're
[2:43:07.360 --> 2:43:09.360]  trying to create a quasi-religion.
[2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:10.360]  That's right.
[2:43:10.360 --> 2:43:11.360]  This is a new religion.
[2:43:11.360 --> 2:43:13.040]  You're really a really astute, smart guy.
[2:43:13.040 --> 2:43:15.760]  Come back for a full hour soon in 60 seconds.
[2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:19.960]  How do you counter the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL and others calling anyone that
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:22.960]  tells the truth to Nazi where it has no connection to reality?
[2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:24.800]  We have them trying to get Tucker Carlson off the air.
[2:43:24.800 --> 2:43:26.360]  We have the ADL saying, I'm a Nazi.
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:27.360]  Take me off air.
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:28.360]  Totally not through.
[2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:31.160]  In 60 seconds, because you're Jewish, but you never make an issue of it.
[2:43:31.160 --> 2:43:32.480]  You're just a pro-freedom guy.
[2:43:32.480 --> 2:43:36.760]  How do you counter leftists claiming they speak for you and that I need to be solid
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:38.840]  because I'm a Nazi?
[2:43:38.840 --> 2:43:43.320]  Well in Canada, sometimes you have to use defamation law, but your First Amendment makes
[2:43:43.320 --> 2:43:45.840]  that impractical in the States.
[2:43:45.840 --> 2:43:52.960]  I think what you have to do is find Jews who are friends of conservatives and understand
[2:43:52.960 --> 2:43:58.880]  the danger, not to conservatives, but the danger of if you turn antisemitism into just
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:04.040]  some political weapon, there are antisemites out there, but that's a word we have to use
[2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:08.280]  rarely and carefully only when someone truly does hate Jews.
[2:44:08.280 --> 2:44:13.080]  If you start using the word antisemitism for anyone you disagree with because he's conservative
[2:44:13.080 --> 2:44:17.520]  or because he wants lower taxes or because he doesn't like the masks, you are profaning
[2:44:17.520 --> 2:44:21.680]  the word antisemitism and you're allowing it to be diluted and watered down.
[2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:26.320]  I agree, so what do you think, I mean obviously Greenblatt's not stupid, why is he doing that?
[2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:28.560]  Calling Tucker Carlson an antisemite.
[2:44:28.560 --> 2:44:35.000]  He's made the decision to rent out his Judaism on a performative, like he does performance
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.160]  antisemitism work.
[2:44:37.160 --> 2:44:42.600]  He's renting it out because he's decided that defeating conservatives is more important
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:44.560]  than preserving the word antisemite for one reason.
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:48.480]  And he never says a word about the left that literally colleges is super antisemitic now.
[2:44:48.480 --> 2:44:52.560]  I mean they just say Jews run everything, it's constant, they say I'm a Jew, I mean
[2:44:52.560 --> 2:44:55.440]  the left is super antisemitic and he's defending them.
[2:44:55.440 --> 2:44:59.240]  Yeah, and of course he used to be an Obama official.
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:03.080]  It's very sad to me because I think there really is antisemitism out there, but if we
[2:45:03.080 --> 2:45:08.240]  start calling anyone we don't like antisemitic, the word loses all meaning.
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:14.440]  And when we really do need it, and there's one more thing, if we say someone is as bad
[2:45:14.440 --> 2:45:18.760]  as Hitler, that means Hitler is no worse than them.
[2:45:18.760 --> 2:45:23.560]  So in a way it's profaning the Holocaust, Hitler murdered six million Jews and millions
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:24.560]  of others.
[2:45:24.560 --> 2:45:28.720]  And if you're saying well Donald Trump is like Hitler, well everyone got to know Donald
[2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:32.160]  Trump a little bit over the last four years, and we say okay, I might disagree with this
[2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:34.760]  and that, but Trump's not a bad guy.
[2:45:34.760 --> 2:45:39.520]  If that's all Hitler was, then Hitler must not have been that bad.
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:42.720]  Exactly, it's giving Hitler a facelift, absolutely, it's very dangerous.
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:46.920]  Israel events, thank you so much, I think you've got several dozen major websites.
[2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:50.720]  I visit them all the time at what rebelnews.com is the best one to visit.
[2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:57.640]  Absolutely, and if you want to see our work this past weekend when police raided our hotel,
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:45:59.880]  we were covering the lockdowns in Montreal.
[2:45:59.880 --> 2:46:03.840]  Oh I forgot, you were there during the riots, oh you got to tell, give us a minute on that,
[2:46:03.840 --> 2:46:06.280]  I know you got to go to your own show, but tell us.
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:12.320]  Sure, well we had, you know there's a curfew in the city of Montreal.
[2:46:12.320 --> 2:46:18.040]  For everyone, for adults and children, everyone has to be in their home now at 8 p.m.
[2:46:18.040 --> 2:46:25.720]  And you can see last night, these are anti-curfew protesters here, so we sent 17 journalists
[2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:29.120]  to Montreal to cover these things.
[2:46:29.120 --> 2:46:34.880]  We rented an Airbnb that was like a little houseboat so we could all stay together in
[2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:35.880]  privacy.
[2:46:35.880 --> 2:46:40.800]  Well police detected where we were staying and they tried to raid our houseboat.
[2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:47.280]  I told them to get a warrant or get off the boat and they couldn't get a judge to give
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:53.120]  them the search warrant, so instead they declared our Airbnb a crime scene, they wouldn't let
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:59.800]  us in or out for 10 hours, they demanded to search our hotel rooms and all our belongings,
[2:46:59.800 --> 2:47:00.800]  our computers were in there.
[2:47:00.800 --> 2:47:04.720]  How many police do they have in Canada where they can put hundreds around a church and
[2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:09.480]  hundreds harassing journalists, I mean how many damn cops do you got up there?
[2:47:09.480 --> 2:47:15.960]  I'm not even kidding, they had at least 50 police around our Airbnb, it was absolutely
[2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:23.680]  insane and they wanted to search our reporter's stuff and incredibly, so I guess I should
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:29.840]  say there is some good news, Alex, in 10 hours they couldn't find a single judge willing
[2:47:29.840 --> 2:47:35.040]  to give them that search warrant and so they were furious, they actually took one of our
[2:47:35.040 --> 2:47:41.840]  reporters to jail and what I'm about to say you might not believe, but it happened, so
[2:47:41.840 --> 2:47:46.280]  you can see they were trying to get through this gate onto our Airbnb and that's our
[2:47:46.280 --> 2:47:51.080]  reporter David Menzies there and this is the cop saying let us in and our reporters are
[2:47:51.080 --> 2:47:53.320]  saying come back with a warrant.
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:57.400]  It's like how Dracula say let me in, these people, so how did this end?
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:01.920]  Well that guy in the white shirt outside his name is David Menzies, he's a great reporter,
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:06.360]  they took him to jail, terrible jail cell in Montreal and they actually said this to
[2:48:06.360 --> 2:48:12.400]  us, I can't believe I'm saying it but it happened, they said we will let David Menzies
[2:48:12.400 --> 2:48:17.680]  out of jail if you let us search your property without a warrant.
[2:48:17.680 --> 2:48:21.080]  They held him hostage, oh my God, to violate the rights.
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:22.080]  It's incredible.
[2:48:22.080 --> 2:48:26.240]  Well that's the thing, you're doing so much, you go over in a little organization, I know
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:31.400]  nobody other than Veritas does as much as you do, we had learned you, I can't even keep
[2:48:31.400 --> 2:48:33.560]  track of all the stuff you're doing.
[2:48:33.560 --> 2:48:37.000]  There's me, they grabbed me, they were holding me, I don't know if you can see that, now
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:40.840]  I know better than to fight with cops, yeah they grabbed my arm and they wouldn't let
[2:48:40.840 --> 2:48:48.600]  me back in the boat with my team and it was just bizarre and they didn't physically hurt
[2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:49.600]  people.
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:51.840]  By the way this is a broad daylight, they're like trying to set journals down that are
[2:48:51.840 --> 2:48:53.080]  on a freaking boat.
[2:48:53.080 --> 2:48:59.000]  Yeah, so I'm very proud of my team of young people who know their rights and weren't
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:03.080]  going to let, look at how many cops are out there and that was just the first wave Alex
[2:49:03.080 --> 2:49:06.920]  and you can see another one of our staff, they wouldn't, yeah there's me, now they just
[2:49:06.920 --> 2:49:09.200]  wouldn't let me in, wouldn't let me talk to my team.
[2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:12.280]  But listen, here's what I'm saying in closing, you gotta go and we gotta go to break.
[2:49:12.280 --> 2:49:17.880]  It's like money python tyrants, it's like if you wanted to turn people against you, you'd
[2:49:17.880 --> 2:49:22.720]  say I want a dictatorship, your prime minister said that, you'd act like this is a journalist,
[2:49:22.720 --> 2:49:25.960]  you'd surround churches, like what the hell is going on here?
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:31.120]  Yeah, well you know what, it was a ten hour standoff at the old port of Montreal, we were
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:37.840]  tweeting about it and about a hundred people came to watch the standoff, we were speaking
[2:49:37.840 --> 2:49:42.560]  very vigorously to the cops, we called them shameful, we said they were breaking their
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:49.560]  oaths, we, I don't think we swore at them but we were very loud and they were oath breakers.
[2:49:49.560 --> 2:49:51.560]  You were assertive in your tweet.
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:57.120]  Yeah, but what was so interesting is ordinary Montrealers who came and gathered around, one
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:50:00.600]  of them said what, are you filming a movie here, they couldn't believe all the cops,
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:05.200]  but when they realized what was going on, they started heckling the cops with much more
[2:50:05.200 --> 2:50:06.200]  vigorous things.
[2:50:06.200 --> 2:50:09.680]  And that's why we had to stand up, we're alone at first but as Mark Twain said in the end
[2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:13.680]  we're gonna win, Ezra we love you, I don't even know about this, incredible, we love
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:16.640]  what you're doing, thank you so much and God bless you.
[2:50:16.640 --> 2:50:17.640]  Thanks Alex.
[2:50:17.640 --> 2:50:20.440]  Wow, and folks that's real journalism, that's what we're doing here at Info Wars, what he's

[2:51:37.840 --> 2:51:43.240]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something,
[2:51:43.240 --> 2:51:47.560]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[2:51:47.560 --> 2:51:51.880]  the years, it is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[2:51:51.880 --> 2:51:55.960]  you, the listeners of this show, I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you,
[2:51:55.960 --> 2:51:59.480]  whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you've got
[2:51:59.480 --> 2:52:04.320]  red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we
[2:52:04.320 --> 2:52:09.560]  are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work
[2:52:09.560 --> 2:52:13.760]  with you over the years and as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future
[2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:19.560]  but again, that's really up to you and up to God, so please, I hope God works through
[2:52:19.560 --> 2:52:24.640]  you and puts a message in your heart to support us, but again, that's up to you and your relationship
[2:52:24.640 --> 2:52:28.560]  with God, I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what
[2:52:28.560 --> 2:52:33.600]  you've done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you
[2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:40.600]  and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse, God bless.
[2:53:03.600 --> 2:53:29.600]  The death machine ain't slowing down, shoot or jenny, bring it and say it, so proud that
[2:53:29.600 --> 2:53:55.600]  you're doing well and it's gonna bring you suicide.
[2:53:55.600 --> 2:54:01.360]  a brand that it was all fake. We made it up with all actors. That was real. So we're
[2:54:01.360 --> 2:54:04.880]  going to be down there in the next few days, live feeds at Band-Aid video, live on the
[2:54:04.880 --> 2:54:08.040]  show, showing you the cars pulling up, the buses pulling up, the people with mental
[2:54:08.040 --> 2:54:13.280]  envelopes just disappearing. Guys, in fact, pull me yesterday's stack. I actually have
[2:54:13.280 --> 2:54:18.720]  their stack right here. I'll find it. I want to show FBI, AP, no one's getting a background
[2:54:18.720 --> 2:54:23.680]  check. The people that have the kids aren't. This is smuggling. It's all illegal. But
[2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:28.400]  Biden waved a magic wand. He doesn't have a magic wand under law. He's not a dictator
[2:54:28.400 --> 2:54:34.400]  at least yet. So, Owen, you just got down there about an hour ago. What have you witnessed?
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:41.040]  Well, we've seen a van load and a bus load be dropped off here at the first point of
[2:54:41.040 --> 2:54:46.640]  entry when they get to McCallan. They go through this COVID testing center. They get processed.
[2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:50.640]  If they pass and they don't have COVID, they get moved to the Catholic facility. If they
[2:54:50.640 --> 2:54:56.280]  don't, if they do have COVID, they stage here, then they get picked up and taken to a hotel,
[2:54:56.280 --> 2:55:00.720]  which they pretty much booked up every hotel here in McCallan for the illegal immigrants
[2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:06.200]  that test positive for COVID. And as I'm sitting here, there's about 30 to 40 illegal immigrants
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:11.680]  inside that facility right now being tested. Once that process is over with, they'll be
[2:55:11.680 --> 2:55:15.440]  released right here. They'll go down the street to the Catholic Charities. And so, we're going
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:18.440]  to sit here. We're going to film this and we're going to show that there's no staging
[2:55:18.440 --> 2:55:23.640]  going on. There's no dramatization that needs to happen. Anybody can come film this and
[2:55:23.640 --> 2:55:28.080]  witness this. So, that's what we're going to be doing today and the rest of the week.
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:32.760]  And of course, Owen, that's a good plan to show them. They may actually keep them there,
[2:55:32.760 --> 2:55:36.560]  but that's not the only facility they're sending people to the Catholic Charity. And there's
[2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:40.440]  other facilities, other quote charities as well. We're just looking at one, and so they
[2:55:40.440 --> 2:55:43.960]  may stay in there hoping you don't videotape them, but regardless, we're going to go show
[2:55:43.960 --> 2:55:47.880]  it. People also ask, why do you show children's faces? Because they're being smuggled. It's
[2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:52.840]  illegal. That's why you put them on the backs of milk cartons and cereal boxes. They may
[2:55:52.840 --> 2:55:59.720]  never be seen again, Owen. Yeah. And why are we the bad guy here? Why are we the ones
[2:55:59.720 --> 2:56:03.960]  under review and being questioned? It shouldn't be us. It should be the illegal immigration
[2:56:03.960 --> 2:56:08.040]  pipeline. That seems to be the problem here. Not the journalists that are just out there
[2:56:08.040 --> 2:56:13.680]  filming it. If you don't want children to be on camera, don't run an illegal immigration
[2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:18.720]  pipeline where children are being used as the passport. That is their passport. That's
[2:56:18.720 --> 2:56:24.000]  why you see one-on-one adult with child as they walk through here, two by two, adult
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:27.960]  child, adult child, because they know if you have a kid, that's a free pass into the United
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:31.560]  States and then you'll get your clothes, you'll get your plane ticket, you'll get whatever
[2:56:31.560 --> 2:56:37.880]  you want, free housing, shelter. And it's that kid that gets you across that border.
[2:56:37.880 --> 2:56:40.960]  And I want to ask your camera crew there, why don't they, while you're talking when
[2:56:40.960 --> 2:56:45.480]  we come back from break, pan and show folks through the fence doing their fake testing
[2:56:45.480 --> 2:56:49.560]  and then as soon as they get ready to go down to the Catholic Charity, follow them. I guarantee
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:54.000]  you there's probably like buses everywhere at the Catholic Charity right now. And I really
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:57.880]  want to get it set up too, where we just do a broadcast in front of the Catholic Charity
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:01.960]  so people can just see what we see because after I left Tuesday, I had to catch a flight
[2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:07.120]  back to Austin, we caught more footage of people cramming kids in Trunks of Carth.
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:11.040]  I mean, literally, they're like, how did Jones catch this? It's like, how did I walk outside
[2:57:11.040 --> 2:57:16.200]  and see the sun in the sky? Oh, Troyer and the rest of the crew doing a great job down
[2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:20.800]  there in McAllen, Texas. And I'll be joining them as well. We're going to go to Brownsville.
[2:57:20.800 --> 2:57:25.440]  We're going to go all over folks, because this is the final breakdown of the US. This is
[2:57:25.440 --> 2:57:32.480]  the big globalist assault. And we are going to lay it all out info wars.com news wars.com.
[2:57:32.480 --> 2:57:37.840]  And of course, we're showing all this documentation, all the mass children faces covered up so
[2:57:37.840 --> 2:57:46.320]  they can smuggle them. The enemy doesn't want this scene. So spread the live link.
[2:57:46.320 --> 2:57:52.760]  The equation is very simple. The mega banks control the media. They control big pharma.
[2:57:52.760 --> 2:57:59.880]  They control academia. They control military industrial complex. They control big tech.
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:04.440]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established
[2:58:04.440 --> 2:58:12.280]  absolute total despotism and dehumanization. It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom
[2:58:12.280 --> 2:58:16.600]  that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens
[2:58:16.600 --> 2:58:23.000]  them. So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:30.440]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[2:58:30.440 --> 2:58:34.920]  that threatens their monopolies of control. That's why they target info wars because we
[2:58:34.920 --> 2:58:39.400]  understand the keys to defeating them. But the only way our transmission gets out is
[2:58:39.400 --> 2:58:44.480]  if you promote info wars and ban that video. So redouble your efforts. We're all in this
[2:58:44.480 --> 2:58:45.480]  together.
[2:58:45.480 --> 2:58:58.960]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news. Today you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:07.400]  All right, folks, we are back live. Alex Jones here in the fourth hour. We'll have some border
[2:59:07.400 --> 2:59:12.840]  coverage for you coming up a little bit later. But first, I really want to air this piece
[2:59:12.840 --> 2:59:17.320]  because this is important. This is Bill Gates on record about his depopulation, about his
[2:59:17.320 --> 2:59:23.320]  plan, about what he's doing, ladies and gentlemen. So everybody needs to see this Bill Gates
[2:59:23.320 --> 2:59:33.320]  report because it lays absolutely every bit of their globalist plan out for depopulation.
[2:59:33.320 --> 2:59:35.320]  Here is that Bill Gates report.
[2:59:35.320 --> 2:59:43.160]  The issue that really grabbed me as urgent were issues related to population.
[2:59:43.160 --> 2:59:48.960]  In 1998, Dr. Zablin became the founding director of the Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for
[2:59:48.960 --> 2:59:49.960]  Population Control.
[2:59:49.960 --> 2:59:55.320]  Dr. Zablin became the founding director of the Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for
[2:59:55.320 --> 2:59:57.320]  Population Control.
[2:59:57.320 --> 3:00:02.560]  We see a lot of things that are going very well. Things like producing childhood death
[3:00:02.560 --> 3:00:08.800]  and things like producing childhood death and...
[3:00:08.800 --> 3:00:14.280]  First, we've got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to
[3:00:14.280 --> 3:00:21.640]  about 9 billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive
[3:00:21.640 --> 3:00:25.800]  health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:33.960]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services,
[3:00:33.960 --> 3:00:37.920]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:45.000]  The problem is that the population is growing the fastest where people are less able to
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:50.520]  deal with it. So it's in the very poorest places that you're going to have a tripling
[3:00:50.520 --> 3:00:58.480]  in population by 2050. And so their ability to feed, educate, provide jobs, stability,
[3:00:58.480 --> 3:01:03.440]  protect the environment in those locations mean, you know, they're faced with an almost
[3:01:03.440 --> 3:01:05.040]  impossible problem.
[3:01:05.040 --> 3:01:12.080]  Here we can see a chart that looks at the total world population over the last several
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:17.720]  hundred years. And at first glance, this is a bit scary. We go from less than a billion
[3:01:17.720 --> 3:01:25.040]  in 1800 and then three, four, five, six and 7.4 billion where we are today is happening
[3:01:25.040 --> 3:01:31.960]  even faster. So Melinda and I wondered whether providing new medicines and keeping children
[3:01:31.960 --> 3:01:37.840]  alive, would that create more of a population problem?
[3:01:37.840 --> 3:01:41.960]  And what the developing world does not need is more children.
[3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:47.520]  And I think that was the biggest aha to Bill and me when we got into this work is we asked
[3:01:47.520 --> 3:01:51.640]  ourselves, of course, the same hard nose question you'd ask, which is, if you get into this
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:01:56.600]  work and you start to save these children, will women just keep overpopulating the world?
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:01:59.600]  And thank goodness the converse is absolutely true.
[3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:06.480]  This is a very important question to get right because it was absolutely key for me. When
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:11.320]  our foundation first started up, it was focused on reproductive health. That was the main
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:16.400]  thing we did because I thought, you know, population growth in poor countries is the
[3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:20.480]  biggest problem they face. You've got to help mothers who want to limit family size have
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:25.280]  the tools and education to do that. That's the only thing that really counts.
[3:02:25.280 --> 3:02:29.720]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would
[3:02:29.720 --> 3:02:36.760]  it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:41.280]  But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:48.400]  Behind closed doors on this New York campus, a secret gathering of some of the world's
[3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:55.880]  most powerful people, Gates, Buffett, Bloomberg, Winfrey, it was like, well, it was like, the
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:03:00.720]  super friend. Together with others at the meeting, including George Soros, Ted Turner,
[3:03:00.720 --> 3:03:07.600]  David Rockefeller, they're worth more than $125 billion. That much money, that much power
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:13.280]  around one table, it begs the question, what were they doing? What were they scheming?
[3:03:13.280 --> 3:03:19.160]  Total world domination? This group, together for six hours, was talking about charity,
[3:03:19.160 --> 3:03:25.880]  education, emergency relief, local health, the new Superman and Wonder Woman, the super
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:32.040]  rich friends, not fighting bad guys, but fighting for good, nonetheless. Apparently one of the
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:36.600]  things they discussed was what each of them knows about what really matters to them.
[3:03:36.600 --> 3:03:40.880]  One knows about what really works and what doesn't work so they can concentrate their
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:45.080]  resources. An epidemic either naturally caused or intentionally
[3:03:45.080 --> 3:03:51.560]  caused is the most likely thing to cause, say, 10 million excess deaths. Today, the
[3:03:51.560 --> 3:04:01.360]  greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. Instead, it looks like this.
[3:04:01.360 --> 3:04:08.160]  If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to
[3:04:08.160 --> 3:04:14.400]  be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Let's look at each one of these and
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:19.640]  see how we can get this down to zero. Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get
[3:04:19.640 --> 3:04:26.000]  pretty near to zero. That's back from a high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:31.440]  I mean, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. Now, malaria is,
[3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:37.680]  of course, transmitted by mosquitoes. I brought some here so you could experience this. We'll
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:47.080]  let those roam around the auditorium a little bit. There's no reason only poor people should
[3:04:47.080 --> 3:04:53.640]  have the experience. But did you come to reproductive issues as
[3:04:53.640 --> 3:04:56.320]  an intellectual? When I was growing up, my parents were
[3:04:56.320 --> 3:05:05.400]  always involved in various volunteer things. My dad had a Planned Parenthood, and it was
[3:05:05.400 --> 3:05:13.320]  very controversial to be involved with that. My dad had a Planned Parenthood. The ultimate
[3:05:13.320 --> 3:05:19.280]  solution, the only thing that really lets us go back completely to normal and feel good
[3:05:19.280 --> 3:05:25.280]  about sitting in a stadium with lots of other people, is to create a vaccine and not just
[3:05:25.280 --> 3:05:33.000]  take care of our country, but take that vaccine out to the global population. Take that vaccine
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:39.600]  out to the global population. We clearly need a vaccine that works in
[3:05:39.600 --> 3:05:46.080]  the upper age range because they're most at risk of that. And doing that so that you
[3:05:46.080 --> 3:05:51.880]  amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don't have side effects. If we have
[3:05:51.880 --> 3:06:03.200]  one in 10,000 side effects, that's way more 700,000 people who will suffer from that.
[3:06:03.200 --> 3:06:09.720]  Way more 700,000 people who will suffer from that.
[3:06:09.720 --> 3:06:15.520]  The side effects for the Moderna vaccine sound concerning. We looked. After the second dose,
[3:06:15.520 --> 3:06:21.840]  at least 80% of participants experienced a systemic side effect, ranging from severe
[3:06:21.840 --> 3:06:29.600]  chills to fevers. So are these vaccines safe?
[3:06:29.600 --> 3:06:38.640]  Well the FDA not being pressured will look hard at that. The FDA is the gold standard
[3:06:38.640 --> 3:06:45.960]  of regulators and their current guidance on this, if they stick with that, is very, very
[3:06:45.960 --> 3:06:55.920]  appropriate. And the side effects were not super severe. That is, it didn't cause permanent
[3:06:55.920 --> 3:07:05.160]  health problems for the things there. Moderna did have to go with a fairly high dose. So
[3:07:05.160 --> 3:07:13.240]  to get the antibodies, some of the other vaccines are going able to go with lower doses to get
[3:07:13.240 --> 3:07:19.960]  responses that are pretty high, including the J&J and the Pfizer. And so there's a lot
[3:07:19.960 --> 3:07:27.040]  of characteristics of these vaccines. It's great that we have multiple of them that are
[3:07:27.040 --> 3:07:28.040]  going out there.
[3:07:28.040 --> 3:07:33.120]  Bill, everybody, you know the data better than I do. But the data show that everybody
[3:07:33.120 --> 3:07:36.200]  with a high dose had a side effect.
[3:07:36.200 --> 3:07:44.320]  Yeah, but some of that is not dramatic, where it's just super painful. But yes, we need
[3:07:44.320 --> 3:07:51.840]  to make sure there's not severe side effects. The FDA, I think, will do a good job of that
[3:07:51.840 --> 3:07:57.480]  despite the pressure. But you don't have a choice. People act like you have a choice.
[3:07:57.480 --> 3:08:03.160]  People don't feel like going to the stadium when they might get infected.
[3:08:03.160 --> 3:08:07.080]  But you don't have a choice. People act like you have a choice.
[3:08:07.080 --> 3:08:11.440]  What else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[3:08:11.440 --> 3:08:19.360]  Well, the idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario, because they're
[3:08:19.360 --> 3:08:23.440]  a pathogen with a high death rate would be ticked. Now, the good news is, I'm trying
[3:08:23.440 --> 3:08:29.240]  to depress you, it's tough enough right now, that most of the work we're going to do to
[3:08:29.240 --> 3:08:35.080]  be ready for pandemic two, I call this pandemic one, most of the work we'll do to be ready
[3:08:35.080 --> 3:08:39.080]  for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of a high death rate.
[3:08:39.080 --> 3:08:42.640]  All right, so we'll be right back. I'm Alex Jones. It's the fourth hour of Durgan-Andis
[3:08:42.640 --> 3:08:43.640]  coming up with breaking news.
[3:08:43.640 --> 3:08:46.720]  I actually bought this. It blocks UHF frequencies.
[3:08:46.720 --> 3:08:52.760]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[3:08:52.760 --> 3:08:59.880]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a

[3:10:47.280 --> 3:11:05.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Hey, you'll have the war room coming up today,
[3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:09.840]  3 to 6 p.m. Owen does a great job, but I was not going to direct those guys. So I said,
[3:11:09.840 --> 3:11:13.200]  hey, you just do your own coverage, do your own thing. And I said, you know, do a live
[3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:17.480]  feed. We'll post it on the front page at infowar.com. Because I mean, I know about the empty COVID
[3:11:17.480 --> 3:11:22.080]  testing center. You've got the McDonough facility, you've got the Catholic charity with people
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:27.360]  swarming it constantly, a four-way stop, total bedlam. All I wanted was, hey, I'm sending
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:33.480]  a team down, show us that four-way stop and do a live show from there. And it wasn't that.
[3:11:33.480 --> 3:11:38.040]  So I just said, hey, fine, you're in charge. Not a mean thing. They're in charge. What
[3:11:38.040 --> 3:11:42.440]  they do at the border will be covered on the war room, not here. And I hope it's important.
[3:11:42.440 --> 3:11:46.080]  I hope it's big. I hope it's great, but I can't have a heart attack. I can't get that
[3:11:46.080 --> 3:11:50.200]  upset anymore. Because then I'm like, hey, let's just pan the camera, then at least show
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:54.840]  the people in the facility. Can't do that. So I'm like, I'm out. I'm out. And I love
[3:11:54.840 --> 3:11:57.800]  the crew, pray for them down there. Maybe I should even go to the border. Maybe I should
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:02.600]  just give up. You know what I mean? Because, I mean, this is so simple. All this is so
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:06.880]  simple to beat the globalists, isn't it? But everybody's got their own little idea about
[3:12:06.880 --> 3:12:10.680]  other things. Maybe I'm wrong. So the crew, I'm sure, will get great footage. It'll be
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:15.400]  on the war room. And that's where there'll be coverage over there. Because I can't have
[3:12:15.400 --> 3:12:19.120]  a heart attack here. Try to cover it. And I only know that if I talk to them privately,
[3:12:19.120 --> 3:12:23.480]  they don't seem to hear me. So if I do it on air, maybe the communication gets across.
[3:12:23.480 --> 3:12:26.800]  But that's where I'm at. I mean, this is real, folks. This is some fake-stage thing. This
[3:12:26.800 --> 3:12:31.040]  is real people fighting globalist takeover. We're down there alone. Almost no one else
[3:12:31.040 --> 3:12:34.800]  even cares. The whole country's collapsing. They got poison vaccines. They're killing
[3:12:34.800 --> 3:12:42.120]  everybody. And everybody just loves it. It's so fun. It's so great. Unbelievable. But they've
[3:12:42.120 --> 3:12:45.320]  got a lot of great investigative stuff when I was down there last week. So look for some
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:50.000]  great reports to be coming out of that. And that'll be on the war room. That's the only
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:54.880]  place you're going to see it, 3 to 6 p.m. Okay. Exposed. Newly recorded footage shows
[3:12:54.880 --> 3:13:00.320]  the expansion of controversial Texas migrant detention center and the continued dehumanizing
[3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:07.160]  conditions endured by illegal immigrants inside the facility. New project. Veritas. Incredible
[3:13:07.160 --> 3:13:11.920]  footage. And that's because there's good people inside that know what's really going on. So
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:16.320]  back in March, they first flew over. But now they've got the new footage now. We're showing
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:22.640]  that for TV viewers right now. And then we've got another big report here for you. We're
[3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:28.200]  going to keep this rolling though. This is important. Hundreds testing positive for COVID
[3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:34.200]  after being fully vaccinated, causing major confusion. And that's just in one area. In
[3:13:34.200 --> 3:13:38.640]  fact, most of the folks dying of COVID later took the vaccine, they're starting to say.
[3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:44.680]  So here's new footage from just a few days ago. Veritas just put this out of the facility.
[3:13:44.680 --> 3:13:50.240]  And as you can see, it's being radically, radically expanded. And they also got aerial
[3:13:50.240 --> 3:13:58.200]  footage of the children sleeping out under the bridge. More footage of that. So great
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:06.040]  job, Project Veritas and great job, whistleblowers. Now it's up to us to go to veritasprojectveritas.com
[3:14:06.040 --> 3:14:12.400]  and get that report and posted in infoawards.com, which we're doing and get it out. That is
[3:14:12.400 --> 3:14:19.600]  what this is all about. And we're scheduled next week, next Monday, to have James O'Keefe
[3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:23.840]  one of my heroes in studio with us. And it's like, I don't think James O'Keefe and his
[3:14:23.840 --> 3:14:27.960]  crew gets enough credit. I mean, they are just kicking ass. They're working so hard.
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:32.800]  They get sued. They get harassed. They get, you know, he gets arrested. They, they, they
[3:14:32.800 --> 3:14:37.040]  have died at him for, you know, showing the feds were committed crimes. But he got, you
[3:14:37.040 --> 3:14:41.360]  know, obviously defeated that. He didn't get out of it. He defeated it. And that's what
[3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:50.440]  this is all about. Because this is a crazy, crazy, crazy time to be alive, ladies and
[3:14:50.440 --> 3:14:57.000]  gentlemen. It is a crazy time. And it's those that want to take the world over and have
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:01.560]  a scientific dictatorship and program every facet of our lives. It's their time. They
[3:15:01.560 --> 3:15:07.200]  think it's their big move against us. Well, Drew Hernandez first cut his teeth and made
[3:15:07.200 --> 3:15:11.680]  his bones politically with all the incredible footage he shot in Kenosha and other areas
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:15.840]  of Minnesota. Well, he's back at it again. He's joining us. I say, anytime you got breaking
[3:15:15.840 --> 3:15:22.760]  news, call us. He will. He fired the bat signal. He'll be joining us coming up next segment.
[3:15:22.760 --> 3:15:27.720]  But this big story, hundreds testing positive for COVID after being fully vaccinated, Americans
[3:15:27.720 --> 3:15:33.040]  and trusted Bill Gates, Dr. Fauci, the who and the CDC were all promised the vaccine
[3:15:33.040 --> 3:15:37.840]  was a routine normality. However, across the country, stories are emerging, casting down
[3:15:37.840 --> 3:15:42.200]  on vaccines effectiveness. It's not hundreds of tens of thousands as people are still testing
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:46.360]  positive for COVID days, weeks and months after being vaccinated. In fact, they're dying
[3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:52.440]  from COVID. The rest of so called breakthrough cases, which we always do. We told you with
[3:15:52.440 --> 3:15:56.040]  experts a year ago, you can't do it for the common cold. Our instances in which a vaccine
[3:15:56.040 --> 3:16:03.240]  of individual still conduct the virus are throwing a wrench in the vaccine efficiency.
[3:16:03.240 --> 3:16:10.520]  EpiC narrative in Washington state, more than 100 people tested positive for COVID despite
[3:16:10.520 --> 3:16:15.320]  taking full vaccine doses over two weeks prior. And but all the drug companies said that wasn't
[3:16:15.320 --> 3:16:21.760]  the case in Michigan. 246 people out of the state's 1.7 million vaccinated have tested
[3:16:21.760 --> 3:16:26.720]  positive for COVID. In Minnesota, more than 1.8 million Minnesotans have revealed that
[3:16:26.720 --> 3:16:34.480]  one vaccine dose reports care 11. The Minnesota Department of Health has identified 222 vaccine
[3:16:34.480 --> 3:16:39.720]  breakthrough cases. In Houston, the city health department reports that over 100 people have
[3:16:39.720 --> 3:16:44.960]  tested positive for the virus, even after being fully vaccinated. It's all a scam, folks.
[3:16:44.960 --> 3:16:51.960]  It goes on and on. It's all page after page of this, it's all based on a fraudulent PCR.
[3:16:51.960 --> 3:17:00.080]  They picked a cold virus because you can never not stop it. It just goes on and on and on
[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:05.640]  and on and on and it's all a lie. And then more and more vaccines and more and more checks
[3:17:05.640 --> 3:17:10.320]  and more and more controls and more and more checkpoints and more and more microchips and
[3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:17.160]  just all of it is a worldwide cashless society, Mark of the Beast control system that we're
[3:17:17.160 --> 3:17:23.760]  not telling you's coming, it's here. And so I'm deep down frustrated and pissed and just
[3:17:23.760 --> 3:17:27.400]  frustrated with the border collapse and frustrated with the Mark of the Beast. And I know you
[3:17:27.400 --> 3:17:31.120]  are as well. So we've all got to not get angry and have heart attacks. I'm telling myself
[3:17:31.120 --> 3:17:36.320]  that personally. Like maybe I shouldn't even go to the board. Maybe I should just take
[3:17:36.320 --> 3:17:41.040]  off. Take off a week and not maybe you should take off a week from this. You know, we sit
[3:17:41.040 --> 3:17:45.320]  here and beat our brains out all day caring about fighting evil and caring about reality
[3:17:45.320 --> 3:17:49.040]  and trying to be engaged and involved and trying to be fastidious and everything. But
[3:17:49.040 --> 3:17:52.520]  maybe that's too extreme. You know, other than a zombie doesn't even care and they're
[3:17:52.520 --> 3:17:56.400]  jellyfish and giving over a great delusion, but they seem to be happy and they're getting
[3:17:56.400 --> 3:17:59.600]  killed that, you know, they don't have any freedom, but you know, they're not alive.
[3:17:59.600 --> 3:18:05.280]  They're not alive. What is it like to be dead like them and not care? It must be horrible.
[3:18:05.280 --> 3:18:09.960]  So actually, I'm glad I'm alive and I'm glad I care. It's just that there's got to be some
[3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:15.000]  type of balance to this. We should do shows this week where we just open the phones up
[3:18:15.000 --> 3:18:20.080]  for four hours and change the subject and ask ourselves, how do you stay sane? How do
[3:18:20.080 --> 3:18:25.200]  you cope with this? How do you deal with this? With this total overthrow of reality, this
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:30.720]  total satanic takeover, devil worship everywhere, pedophilia everywhere, death everywhere, them
[3:18:30.720 --> 3:18:36.080]  killing us, them lying to us and trying to cart race wars everywhere. When all we want
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:41.240]  is fellow love for each other and the bad guys are singing in, knowing what they're
[3:18:41.240 --> 3:18:48.480]  doing, sticking the knife in, putting salt to the wound. It's just mind blowing. Because
[3:18:48.480 --> 3:18:54.200]  you know, my spirit's willing, my flesh is weak. I don't want to blow up on here. I don't
[3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:57.920]  want to get mad, but they're on TV going, oh, here's little blue, little green octopuses.
[3:18:57.920 --> 3:19:02.040]  We're going to put a new letter, nano chips that'll track you. Oh, it's so liberal. But
[3:19:02.040 --> 3:19:06.160]  Alice Jones is a liar. No one wants to put chips in you. It's just like, oh, Joe, Joey
[3:19:06.160 --> 3:19:11.840]  Reed's going to wear two masks and even I'm being vaccinated because it's a cult of Frigatoids
[3:19:11.840 --> 3:19:16.840]  paid to lie to you. And we got this footage. I'll play next segment of the Justice Department
[3:19:16.840 --> 3:19:21.200]  official doesn't have his mask on, puts it on, gets up on stage, takes it off and then
[3:19:21.200 --> 3:19:25.880]  quitter banned the video just to cover their ass, to cover their fraud, to cover their
[3:19:25.880 --> 3:19:30.480]  lie, to gaslight us. Why would anybody go along with this? Why are so many of our fellow
[3:19:30.480 --> 3:19:38.600]  humans participating in their own destruction? Why are people so unconscious? Well, they're
[3:19:38.600 --> 3:19:45.600]  right back. Stay with us. Again, I don't like to lecture people. I'm a very private person,
[3:19:45.600 --> 3:19:49.600]  but because of the globalist, their attack on humanity, I've been forced to last 27
[3:19:49.600 --> 3:19:53.280]  years to be a public figure. And we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their
[3:19:53.280 --> 3:19:58.160]  money because of God. And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all
[3:19:58.160 --> 3:20:01.720]  day, but just give me a break. The statinism's out in the open. I've always been a Christian,
[3:20:01.720 --> 3:20:06.440]  but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear. And I get it. A
[3:20:06.440 --> 3:20:11.040]  lot of you have been turned off by big churches. A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt
[3:20:11.040 --> 3:20:15.480]  priest class system. And I get it. Me too. Believe me, I'm one of them. But it's that
[3:20:15.480 --> 3:20:21.760]  relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential. And
[3:20:21.760 --> 3:20:26.600]  God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life. And so
[3:20:26.600 --> 3:20:30.480]  that's what info wars is really all about. So thank you all for your word of mouth. Thank

[3:22:45.600 --> 3:23:12.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:23:12.080 --> 3:23:39.560]  He's got breaking news.
[3:23:39.560 --> 3:23:44.160]  He covered Minnesota riots, Kenosha riots, riots all over. He covered the border. We
[3:23:44.160 --> 3:23:48.640]  saw him down there last week with all that craziness. And he's got breaking news for
[3:23:48.640 --> 3:23:51.640]  us right now. Investigative Journalist Drew Hernandez. Thanks for joining us.
[3:23:51.640 --> 3:23:53.800]  What's going on, Alex? Thanks for having me.
[3:23:53.800 --> 3:23:56.480]  Well, you were telling us you got breaking news. We know you always break big news.
[3:23:56.480 --> 3:23:57.480]  What's happening?
[3:23:57.480 --> 3:24:01.480]  Yeah, I mean, I think everyone could see by now just exactly what's taking place in
[3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:06.320]  Minneapolis. Riots are breaking out literally all last night. The looting is starting all
[3:24:06.320 --> 3:24:09.800]  over again. I'm pretty sure we're going to start to see some burning buildings in the
[3:24:09.800 --> 3:24:14.720]  upcoming days. The body cam footage has been released. And like always, Alex, black lives
[3:24:14.720 --> 3:24:18.000]  matter. They don't want to wait for evidence. They don't want to wait for the body cam footage.
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:21.360]  All their activists, they start getting riled up on the scene. They don't even wait for
[3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:25.040]  what's taking place actually in real time because now it's come to find out that the
[3:24:25.040 --> 3:24:29.560]  guy that actually was shot and killed had warrants for his arrest. Literally the police
[3:24:29.560 --> 3:24:34.000]  were trying to apprehend him trying to arrest him on the spot. He tries to get back into
[3:24:34.000 --> 3:24:38.400]  his car and drive off. And then the officer actually mistaken. She believes she had a
[3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:42.080]  taser in her hand actually had her gun in her hand and shot him. But the fact of the
[3:24:42.080 --> 3:24:46.360]  matter is don't resist arrest because when you're doing something like that, these are
[3:24:46.360 --> 3:24:49.960]  the kinds of things that happen in black lives matter just doesn't wait. They don't want
[3:24:49.960 --> 3:24:53.760]  the evidence. They don't want the body cam footage. They just immediately mobilize and
[3:24:53.760 --> 3:24:57.480]  start looting buildings. And even one of the businesses that got looted last night, Alex
[3:24:57.480 --> 3:25:01.080]  was actually Asian owned. So I mean, this is just a mess. It's going to continue to
[3:25:01.080 --> 3:25:04.800]  get worse. And I think we're going to see a lot more horrific things coming out of Minneapolis,
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:09.080]  especially with the Chauvin case. That's going to conclude very soon.
[3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:15.000]  Why do you think CNN, the globalists in the WikiLeaks want racial division? It is just
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:20.120]  a distraction from Apple running death camps or I mean, I mean, what is it? Why do they
[3:25:20.120 --> 3:25:25.560]  why do they keep doing this and then covering up and defending, you know, really bad elements
[3:25:25.560 --> 3:25:31.000]  of society going around and robbing the local beauty salon, the local liquor store, the
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:36.360]  local, the local tennis shoe shop, Target, pizza places. I mean, this is ridiculous.
[3:25:36.360 --> 3:25:40.160]  I mean, I could tell you, Alex, why black lives matter wants this, especially the founders
[3:25:40.160 --> 3:25:45.240]  and co-founders. She's spending millions of dollars. She's racking in millions of dollars,
[3:25:45.240 --> 3:25:49.640]  Alex, spending millions on mansions, estates across the United States of America. These
[3:25:49.640 --> 3:25:53.840]  are the same people, Alex, that are running around with Marxist communist ideology saying,
[3:25:53.840 --> 3:25:59.240]  oh, we all need equality, especially financially. But every time a black person dies, BLM gets
[3:25:59.240 --> 3:26:04.560]  paid. Every time a black person gets shot by a cop, BLM gets paid millions. That's on
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:09.200]  record. That's a fact. That's their brand, Alex. That is literally their niche. That
[3:26:09.200 --> 3:26:13.760]  is what they do. Their brand is black people getting shot by cops because now it's on record
[3:26:13.760 --> 3:26:18.640]  that BLM founders and co-founders are spending millions of dollars on mansions while they
[3:26:18.640 --> 3:26:22.600]  preach to us, Alex, that, oh, black people are financially and systemically-
[3:26:22.600 --> 3:26:27.720]  Sure. You have this big giant riot, you know, in California and Minnesota, then another
[3:26:27.720 --> 3:26:32.480]  black guy gets killed brandishing a gun and then, thank God, it just creates a self-fulfilling
[3:26:32.480 --> 3:26:37.360]  prophecy because then all the white liberals will then donate money, $10.6 billion, to
[3:26:37.360 --> 3:26:39.400]  these three women that are building private airports.
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:44.520]  Yeah. Well, at the same time, they preach to us that black people are financially suppressed,
[3:26:44.520 --> 3:26:48.360]  they're systemically oppressed, and that they're not having any success in the United
[3:26:48.360 --> 3:26:53.040]  States of America. Their Marxist ideology makes no sense. They need a capitalist system
[3:26:53.040 --> 3:26:57.560]  in order to thrive and succeed because they say they want utopia for all. They want equality
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:27:00.160]  for all when they're literally stuffing their pockets.
[3:27:00.160 --> 3:27:04.840]  Listen, even their BLM activist, Alex, they have autonomous zones across the United States
[3:27:04.840 --> 3:27:10.160]  of America. Some of these autonomous zones, especially BLM Plaza in D.C., is rat-infested.
[3:27:10.160 --> 3:27:14.680]  It's disgusting. The living quarters people are living there while BLM founders are sitting
[3:27:14.680 --> 3:27:19.320]  high and mighty in million-dollar estates while they're just racking in millions of
[3:27:19.320 --> 3:27:23.000]  dollars, whether useful idiots are just sleeping on streets thinking that they're ushering
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:27.240]  in the New World Order in utopia. These people are getting played. It's a scam. The United
[3:27:27.240 --> 3:27:29.360]  States of America needs to wake up to this garbage.
[3:27:29.360 --> 3:27:32.960]  I agree. What about the paradox, because you've been tracking all this on Twitter's full of
[3:27:32.960 --> 3:27:40.480]  amazing footage I haven't seen anywhere else, of churches in Europe, in Asia, in Canada,
[3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:46.200]  the U.S. all shut down, but Walmart, the topless bars are open, but then when Black Lives Matter
[3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:50.160]  marches and burns themselves down, they go, oh, statistics show that helped fight COVID.
[3:27:50.160 --> 3:27:54.200]  That was a real fake study they had. I mean, it's just none of it holds water.
[3:27:54.200 --> 3:27:59.480]  I think it's as simple as this, Alex. I mean, they don't want any type of righteous law.
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:04.400]  They are legalizing criminal activity, and they are criminalizing righteousness. That
[3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:08.240]  is exactly what they want. This is all about power and control. They know what they're
[3:28:08.240 --> 3:28:12.200]  doing is wrong. Don't be mistaken. I'm not talking to you, Alex, the viewers. Don't think
[3:28:12.200 --> 3:28:16.440]  that these people don't know that they're hypocrites, and they're not aware that what
[3:28:16.440 --> 3:28:20.480]  they're doing is 100% a double standard. They know, but they don't care, because this is
[3:28:20.480 --> 3:28:22.160]  about power. It's about control.
[3:28:22.160 --> 3:28:25.720]  They're right. It's all a big joke. It's all a big joke to them.
[3:28:25.720 --> 3:28:30.640]  Absolutely. And they want to control us. Whatever their form of religion is, or whatever they
[3:28:30.640 --> 3:28:35.800]  declare is truth, whatever their relative minds, declares is acceptable in society,
[3:28:35.800 --> 3:28:38.440]  that is what they will go with. And this is why people are trying to wrap their minds
[3:28:38.440 --> 3:28:43.760]  around like, oh, what about the capital, what about the capital right on January 6th? Everyone
[3:28:43.760 --> 3:28:47.800]  on the left, all these left-leaning journals, they mobilized immediately, became PIs, working
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:52.000]  hand in hand with the FBI when they were defund the police all 2020. Where are they now?
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:55.200]  They're nowhere to be found, because it doesn't matter. It's what their narrative is. If they
[3:28:55.200 --> 3:28:59.480]  want to target right-wingers, conservatives, or centrists, they will do so even at the
[3:28:59.480 --> 3:29:03.800]  expense of their morality, or literally their hypocrisy. They don't care. It's literally
[3:29:03.800 --> 3:29:08.400]  a polarized information war, and that is what they are doing. And honestly, Alex, they are
[3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:12.600]  literally winning in the mainstream media, because people buy into this stuff. They want
[3:29:12.600 --> 3:29:16.920]  to accept the reality that Black Lives Matter is a scam, because what they are doing is
[3:29:16.920 --> 3:29:21.560]  making millions of dollars every time a black person is shot by a cop, and they try to preach
[3:29:21.560 --> 3:29:26.800]  to us that black people are financially oppressed when they're living in mansions. Who believes
[3:29:26.800 --> 3:29:32.600]  this at this point, Alex? It's a scam. People need to wake the hell up. They're liars. It's
[3:29:32.600 --> 3:29:38.480]  not real. It's 100% fake and fraudulent, and they're using black people in order to stuff
[3:29:38.480 --> 3:29:44.200]  their profits. Actually, I take that back. They're using dead, shot black people to stuff
[3:29:44.200 --> 3:29:47.120]  their pockets with millions of dollars, especially how these are.
[3:29:47.120 --> 3:29:51.680]  The only thing you're wrong about, Drew Hernandez, is it's billion, 10.6 billion to Black Lives
[3:29:51.680 --> 3:29:56.880]  Matter, these three women. And the headlines are wrong. They found one $1.5 million house.
[3:29:56.880 --> 3:30:02.440]  Now they found four more worth tens of millions in private air runways. I mean, this woman's
[3:30:02.440 --> 3:30:08.520]  got private jets, everything in like the whitest neighborhoods anywhere in America.
[3:30:08.520 --> 3:30:13.600]  Yeah. While we're told that they're financially oppressed and black people are living in horrible
[3:30:13.600 --> 3:30:17.960]  situations, which what I add is like, listen, I'm just going to say this to the black community.
[3:30:17.960 --> 3:30:22.520]  Honestly, for a lot of these communities that are torn, that are worn, that are literally
[3:30:22.520 --> 3:30:27.520]  living in poverty, I don't think it's smart. You guys are literally being gaslit in order
[3:30:27.520 --> 3:30:32.520]  to destroy your own communities even further. What this organization does and these political
[3:30:32.520 --> 3:30:38.040]  leaning people do, especially the mainstream media, CNN wants you to act wild. CNN wants
[3:30:38.040 --> 3:30:41.860]  you to go werewolf and act wild in your own community. They want you because it's good
[3:30:41.860 --> 3:30:46.240]  for clicks. It's good for optics. They want your communities to do this to yourselves.
[3:30:46.240 --> 3:30:50.320]  So don't sit here and tell us that, oh, you're living in such bad situations. Your communities
[3:30:50.320 --> 3:30:56.120]  are literally dying because of ghetto and poverty policies. Maybe right now, the idea
[3:30:56.120 --> 3:31:00.600]  for the black community isn't to continue to further rip their own communities apart.
[3:31:00.600 --> 3:31:04.120]  Maybe right now they should wake up to the reality that they are being used. They are
[3:31:04.120 --> 3:31:08.360]  being used even by their own people. Well, that's a big there. They're Marxist
[3:31:08.360 --> 3:31:12.160]  Leninists that say they want to get rid of the nuclear family. They want black men to
[3:31:12.160 --> 3:31:16.720]  be trans and that all white people are the devil and need to be basically eradicated.
[3:31:16.720 --> 3:31:20.200]  And then they move into the most rich white neighborhoods they can with private airfields
[3:31:20.200 --> 3:31:26.320]  in their yard. If I don't know how much that costs, folks, I mean, that is insane.
[3:31:26.320 --> 3:31:30.760]  It is literally a scam. I think that's where it falls in the terms and the context of Black
[3:31:30.760 --> 3:31:35.680]  Lives Matter. They are being used. The black community is literally being hustled. The
[3:31:35.680 --> 3:31:40.240]  black community is being finessed. The black community is being manipulated. The black
[3:31:40.240 --> 3:31:44.200]  community, especially left-leaning blacks right now, are being used to usher in like
[3:31:44.200 --> 3:31:50.640]  a Trojan horse communism into the United States of America while the founders are leveraging
[3:31:50.640 --> 3:31:56.280]  and utilizing a capitalist system while trying to preach to us communism. When are people
[3:31:56.280 --> 3:32:00.400]  going to wake up? This is who they are. It's 100 percent hypocrisy. And all I have to say
[3:32:00.400 --> 3:32:05.640]  to the American people right now, especially the black community is stop supporting them.
[3:32:05.640 --> 3:32:12.200]  But listen, you're absolutely right through that at a tertiary level, blacks are supporting
[3:32:12.200 --> 3:32:15.760]  Black Lives Matter, some of them are. But it's mainly white liberals who gave $10.6
[3:32:15.760 --> 3:32:22.800]  billion to these women. I mean, that's who cuts a check. It was big pharma and big tech.
[3:32:22.800 --> 3:32:28.000]  Well, Apple gave $100 million to it. So these women can have all private jets. And great
[3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:32.280]  if she got a private jet for a computer program or a book she wrote or whatever. But no, it's
[3:32:32.280 --> 3:32:41.680]  off of, oh, America sucks so bad. And then she's got five mansions and private fields.

[3:33:44.400 --> 3:33:45.400]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[3:33:45.400 --> 3:33:49.680]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all
[3:33:49.680 --> 3:33:53.720]  this stupidity. Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year,
[3:33:53.720 --> 3:34:00.840]  okay? I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[3:34:00.840 --> 3:34:06.080]  Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed
[3:34:06.080 --> 3:34:11.920]  me. Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying
[3:34:11.920 --> 3:34:17.680]  as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you
[3:34:17.680 --> 3:34:24.960]  up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's
[3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:30.360]  sake. And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one
[3:34:30.360 --> 3:34:32.680]  another. That's right where we're at brother.
[3:34:32.680 --> 3:34:37.120]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and
[3:34:37.120 --> 3:34:42.600]  that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[3:34:42.600 --> 3:34:47.800]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world. They are creating insecurity, crime,
[3:34:47.800 --> 3:34:53.320]  war and famine. All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves
[3:34:53.320 --> 3:34:58.600]  and our family's sakes but also our community. And citizensstronghold.com is the best place
[3:34:58.600 --> 3:35:03.200]  to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find. Again,

[3:35:43.080 --> 3:35:48.000]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment. Cell phones are
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:53.800]  an amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld. But big tech, large corporations,
[3:35:53.800 --> 3:35:59.080]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS especially are using this to steal
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:03.760]  your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop
[3:36:03.760 --> 3:36:08.600]  up billions of people's data. They can actually predict on record what's going to happen in
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:16.680]  mass movements. Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[3:36:16.680 --> 3:36:20.680]  In their own words, they admit it. So I've been selling privacy pouches and block and
[3:36:20.680 --> 3:36:24.320]  pocket some things like that for more than a decade. And now the units have gotten really
[3:36:24.320 --> 3:36:28.880]  lightweight. They're Faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope. They work absolutely
[3:36:28.880 --> 3:36:33.720]  great. And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over
[3:36:33.720 --> 3:36:37.680]  your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to
[3:36:37.680 --> 3:36:44.680]  because it's another business. Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[3:37:07.680 --> 3:37:32.680]  By the way, I sent two proofs down to the border. And during the break I clicked on infowarstore.com
[3:37:32.680 --> 3:37:40.040]  and I saw a whole bunch of kids pile out of the back of a bus and go to the so-called
[3:37:40.040 --> 3:37:44.520]  Catholic charity and soon they'll come piling out and they'll get loaded in the back of
[3:37:44.520 --> 3:37:51.840]  a car, the back of a trunk. So there's your webcam live at infowarstore.com of what's
[3:37:51.840 --> 3:37:56.280]  going on. What I wanted to do was have Olin and crew right there. So when people got off
[3:37:56.280 --> 3:38:00.160]  and people came out, we would have the footage because that's right where I stopped the car
[3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:03.400]  just the other day that they said last week was fake and all the rest of it. Yeah, you're
[3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:09.200]  going to see how fake it is because we got a live feed of it at infowarstore.com and
[3:38:09.200 --> 3:38:16.880]  we're trying to have it going like 14 hours a day or so during the daylight. So there
[3:38:16.880 --> 3:38:22.760]  you go. Great job, the crew. And we'll see tomorrow if I can get the crew down there.
[3:38:22.760 --> 3:38:25.760]  So I got to actually interview them in front of us, but I may just have to go out there
[3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:31.600]  anyway. Going back to Drew Hernandez. Drew, you were there. This is a bigger story than
[3:38:31.600 --> 3:38:34.680]  just you and I because you were already been at the Texas border. You said you were going
[3:38:34.680 --> 3:38:37.240]  back. You said, hey, I'm going to be down there next weekend. I said, that's funny.
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:41.080]  We're going there. Olin and crew had just been there. Did a great job. I went down there.
[3:38:41.080 --> 3:38:45.680]  I ran into you five or six times. I guess you were at the same spots I was, the Donut
[3:38:45.680 --> 3:38:50.600]  facility over there. What did you see the times I wasn't with you? Because I only ran
[3:38:50.600 --> 3:38:54.560]  into you a few times. What else did you witness? Because I saw crazy stuff every time I was
[3:38:54.560 --> 3:38:58.760]  with you or ran into you. What did you see when you were down there and weren't with
[3:38:58.760 --> 3:39:05.280]  us? I think the main story here is how organized this all is. Because I mean, when you follow
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:11.320]  this whole, it's systematic, Alex. When you follow this whole chain, there's a link into
[3:39:11.320 --> 3:39:15.960]  every single one of this chains. And when you follow it, as you see these buses literally
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:20.760]  coming from the middle, the United States side, when they get apprehended at the border
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:25.800]  down at Mexico where the makeshift detention camp is, you see these buses literally come
[3:39:25.800 --> 3:39:30.440]  in through the incomplete border while the gates are completely open. That same bus goes
[3:39:30.440 --> 3:39:35.640]  all the way to the COVID, the migrant COVID-19 testing facility. They dropped them off because
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:39.800]  as I was looking at my footage, I took a look at the buses and you could see the bus numbers
[3:39:39.800 --> 3:39:44.800]  literally on them. The same bus that came from that makeshift detention camp is the
[3:39:44.800 --> 3:39:49.680]  same bus that is dropping people off at the migrant COVID-19 testing facility, which is
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:53.600]  literally right down the street from that so-called Catholic charity. So I think what
[3:39:53.600 --> 3:39:58.160]  people need to understand is this is extremely organized. It's not like it's just happening.
[3:39:58.160 --> 3:40:01.400]  They're just shooting from the hip. They're just trying to get this done. The administration
[3:40:01.400 --> 3:40:05.400]  has this seriously organized and the Border Patrol, I've been having conversations with
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:09.480]  some Border Patrol about this so-called Catholic charity. A lot of people hate them, actually.
[3:40:09.480 --> 3:40:12.760]  Well, by the way, they don't look like any Catholic thing I've ever seen. It sees women
[3:40:12.760 --> 3:40:16.440]  with devil tattoos all over them and they take the women's cell phones away and there's
[3:40:16.440 --> 3:40:19.880]  dudes in there shopping for women. I mean, this is crazy.
[3:40:19.880 --> 3:40:24.120]  Yeah. So Border Patrol, actually, when I talked to them about this particular organization,
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:28.360]  they actually called it an NGO, a non-government organization. So that's right. It's not a
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:32.240]  Catholic charity. It's registered as a UN NGO. You're absolutely right.
[3:40:32.240 --> 3:40:36.800]  Absolutely. It's an NGO. There's no accountability. There's no oversight. They're literally not
[3:40:36.800 --> 3:40:41.000]  vetting if these people are actually families. They don't know if they're actually related.
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:45.400]  These kids could possibly be even belonging to somebody else. And I mean, let me make
[3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:48.920]  this point because people are like, oh, you disrupted migrant mothers. You disrupted them
[3:40:48.920 --> 3:40:54.040]  from being transported to a safe place. Like, look, it is not safe. It is 100% illegal to
[3:40:54.040 --> 3:40:58.920]  be stuffing children into the back of a hatchback without any seeds. I mean, even the article
[3:40:58.920 --> 3:41:05.560]  and the FBI waives the background checks and Biden's waived the law. He can't do that.
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:09.120]  He could do an executive order. Then the courts might overturn it, but he needs to have a
[3:41:09.120 --> 3:41:14.600]  law. Imagine if Trump was doing something like this. Imagine if Trump was trying to
[3:41:14.600 --> 3:41:19.000]  black out the sun like Bill Gates. Imagine if Trump was trying to wave kids through and
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:23.240]  just give them the smugglers. Yeah. I mean, what were they calling it? Just a couple
[3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:28.320]  of years ago, Alex, you had you had AOC saying that these are these are concentration camps,
[3:41:28.320 --> 3:41:33.760]  comparing it literally to Nancy 1945 Jews literally stuffed into concentration camps
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:38.680]  to be gas, to be put in a lineup and shot to be incinerated. That was the rhetoric just
[3:41:38.680 --> 3:41:42.240]  a couple of years ago, but now it was only because of Trump. But now they're literally
[3:41:42.240 --> 3:41:46.480]  stuffing kids into the back of cars without any government oversight. They're claiming
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:50.360]  there's oversight, but these are NGOs. What people need to understand is that these are
[3:41:50.360 --> 3:41:54.840]  non government entities and what they're doing is literally doing it without any accountability.
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:41:59.320]  So we have no idea what's going on. Listen, if we go and interview one of these people
[3:41:59.320 --> 3:42:03.760]  working for these organizations and we ask them, do you even know if these are families?
[3:42:03.760 --> 3:42:07.200]  Do you even have the ability to vet these people? Do you even know who they are? They'll
[3:42:07.200 --> 3:42:11.680]  say no 100%. That's why they won't talk to anybody. That's why they won't talk to us.
[3:42:11.680 --> 3:42:15.760]  I literally asked her and request for a comment and all I got was a door shut in my face and
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:19.720]  I'm the bad guy and we're the bad guys, Alex. When we're just trying to find out where they're
[3:42:19.720 --> 3:42:24.360]  taking kids, being stuffed into the back of a car without any seats to without any government
[3:42:24.360 --> 3:42:29.160]  oversight. Is that it? Does that exemplify what the Biden administration is doing? I
[3:42:29.160 --> 3:42:34.760]  would probably say yes, because they're reckless. There's no justifying that even the article
[3:42:34.760 --> 3:42:38.480]  they requested from the charity. They asked her whatever her name is. They asked her,
[3:42:38.480 --> 3:42:42.480]  oh, and that about the seat belts thing? Yeah, it shouldn't have even happened. It wasn't
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:48.480]  even about seat belts, Alex. The kids didn't even have seats. No seats. And somehow that's
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:49.480]  okay.
[3:42:49.480 --> 3:42:55.160]  Well, it shows how it shows how they devalue these people. And I'm going to play a clip
[3:42:55.160 --> 3:42:58.720]  right now since you mentioned it. This is for Saturday show that did get about half
[3:42:58.720 --> 3:43:04.920]  million views, but it should have again, 10 million views. And this is a clip eight creepy
[3:43:04.920 --> 3:43:09.960]  bold guy. So we had a current law enforcement lady senior law enforcement. She went inside
[3:43:09.960 --> 3:43:15.160]  from a nearby area. I'll leave it at that. She goes in and comes out and says, hey, he's
[3:43:15.160 --> 3:43:19.040]  in there picking out women single women he wants to take back to Pennsylvania. He comes
[3:43:19.040 --> 3:43:24.080]  out to follow her runs into our security guys and admits it on video. The audio isn't the
[3:43:24.080 --> 3:43:28.960]  best because they swung the camera around a hip level to catch this guy. But that's
[3:43:28.960 --> 3:43:37.000]  how crazy all of this is. And then unaccompanied babies with a woman that works there, handing
[3:43:37.000 --> 3:43:42.000]  them off to other people at the airport. No documents are looked at. Our crew did a great
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:44.840]  job the day after I left. They did a great job when I was there. But the day after, my
[3:43:44.840 --> 3:43:50.440]  God, they locked us out of the park with all this footage. And so let's play, let's play
[3:43:50.440 --> 3:43:54.800]  clip seven first. I'll narrate for you viewers. This is the illegal aliens being brought through
[3:43:54.800 --> 3:43:59.360]  and allow the planes without showing the documentation. The first woman shows that nobody else. And
[3:43:59.360 --> 3:44:03.040]  then we also then we have the baby being handed off. Then we have clip eight. This guy follows
[3:44:03.040 --> 3:44:07.840]  this woman out that was talking to one of the Spanish police officer. Leave it at that.
[3:44:07.840 --> 3:44:12.080]  And he tried he runs in our security people and start trying to explain to them while
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:18.760]  he sniffs them like a demon. And this is very wolf like. So play clip seven and clip eight.
[3:44:18.760 --> 3:44:24.920]  So now instead of going through the normal TSA checkpoint, that would usually usually
[3:44:24.920 --> 3:44:33.040]  be manned by a TSA person. As you can see, it's made by a patrol agent who is then as
[3:44:33.040 --> 3:44:39.640]  you can see, looking at those documents. And as you can see, there's no passport. There's
[3:44:39.640 --> 3:44:48.320]  no government issued ID. It is just a board patrol packet that's been put together. And
[3:44:48.320 --> 3:44:54.920]  of that packet alone, they will be allowed to pass through security and fly into United
[3:44:54.920 --> 3:44:59.200]  States of America, a destination city of their choice. Obviously, McAllen is United States
[3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:04.800]  of America, but they are now being allowed to continue on into the interior of the United
[3:45:04.800 --> 3:45:12.520]  States. And now they just wave everybody through. Again, if that was you or me, ladies and
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:18.200]  gentlemen, the first person of contact would be a TSA person that we come in contact with.
[3:45:18.200 --> 3:45:22.840]  But here's a board patrol agent because we have to facilitate them getting through the
[3:45:22.840 --> 3:45:27.480]  checkpoint without government issued ID. And that's what the board of patrol agent is here
[3:45:27.480 --> 3:45:34.320]  to do. And it's not his fault. These are the orders he's been given from his superiors
[3:45:34.320 --> 3:45:40.080]  in the board of control and from the Department of Homeland Security. This is the approach
[3:45:40.080 --> 3:45:44.560]  that the Biden administration has chosen to take to sit there and deal with the migrant
[3:45:44.560 --> 3:45:51.560]  crisis on our U.S. border. No deportations anymore, folks. This is a free ticket in
[3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:57.840]  the United States of America. And there he is. He's just starting to wave in people
[3:45:57.840 --> 3:46:01.160]  through by then that he saw that. And then here's the next clip. We won't have time to
[3:46:01.160 --> 3:46:05.480]  play it all. This show's over. Owen's coming up with his live coverage from the border.
[3:46:05.480 --> 3:46:08.880]  And he's in charge of that, so sure it'll be interesting. But here's this guy. Look at
[3:46:08.880 --> 3:46:15.840]  us. And we're not in control of that. We can't stop. So we can either tape work or tape
[3:46:15.840 --> 3:46:22.680]  work. That's the way how to get it. I know that's what I'm trying. I mean, we're stuck
[3:46:22.680 --> 3:46:29.480]  anywhere. One way or another. Yeah, but they feel privileged. They feel entitled. And after
[3:46:29.480 --> 3:46:33.280]  speaking to people in there, they're not, they don't, they don't care to clean up
[3:46:33.280 --> 3:46:40.280]  after themselves. You'll, you'll marry them for free. And they don't care.
[3:46:40.280 --> 3:46:44.280]  All right.
[3:46:44.280 --> 3:46:51.280]  Just constantly creating new businesses and we can't find people to stop. So we've
[3:46:51.280 --> 3:46:57.280]  got to show the affidavit to support. So therefore, but they got to work.
[3:46:57.280 --> 3:47:01.280]  They got to work. All right, Dr. Hernandez, join us again in the next few days. People
[3:47:01.280 --> 3:47:05.280]  can follow you on Twitter and so much more. Thank you so much for the time, buddy. Good
[3:47:05.280 --> 3:47:06.280]  job.
[3:47:06.280 --> 3:47:07.280]  Thank you.
[3:47:07.280 --> 3:47:11.280]  All right, war rooms coming up live from the border. We'll see what's about to happen.
[3:47:11.280 --> 3:47:15.280]  We've also got that live cam in front of the so-called Catholic Charities as a UN NGO.
[3:47:15.280 --> 3:47:20.280]  That live feed is also up on info wars.com. I wanted to have one at that live feed for
[3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:24.280]  you to go confront the buses and stuff. Maybe that's coming up. I'm not sure. So it should
[3:47:24.280 --> 3:47:29.280]  be interesting on the war room coming up info wars.com news wars.com. Tomorrow's news
[3:47:29.280 --> 3:47:31.280]  war room.
