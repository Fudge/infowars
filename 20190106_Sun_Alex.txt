[00:00.000 --> 00:27.660]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27.660 --> 00:39.320]  It is January 6, 2019 under Alex Jones, and the anti-American, anti-free market, anti-Western,
[00:39.320 --> 00:47.680]  anti-Christian, globalist corporate Borg have decided that I'm a troublemaker, and
[00:47.680 --> 00:51.560]  for many years they've been trying to take me off the air, but now we've been sustaining
[00:51.560 --> 00:57.660]  under incredible frontal assaults, backstabbing assaults, every assault you can imagine, and
[00:57.660 --> 01:04.980]  I'm not a victim, I'm not an SJW, I am extremely pleased, and very happy to be in the position
[01:04.980 --> 01:05.980]  we're in.
[01:05.980 --> 01:13.980]  I personally don't like some of the pain, but as Glenn Danzig once said, I don't mind
[01:13.980 --> 01:20.740]  the pain, because if it brings me to a better outcome before I need to go, I'm ready to
[01:20.740 --> 01:30.620]  do it, but you know, the pain of submitting the globalist is much greater than going with
[01:30.620 --> 01:42.580]  the pain of resisting them, but still before war, my friends, I don't mind the pain, but
[01:42.580 --> 01:50.660]  the way of avoiding pain leads into entropy, leads into collapse.
[01:50.660 --> 01:57.300]  Now the reason I'm more confident than ever is that everything we've predicted, everything
[01:57.300 --> 02:03.900]  we've broken down, everything that we've covered in the giant global spectrum of news and information
[02:03.900 --> 02:11.820]  is so damn on target, it's just uncanny, and that's really what matters at the end
[02:11.820 --> 02:17.900]  of the day, is that humanity have a choice to make about which side they stand on and
[02:17.900 --> 02:22.820]  what they want to do, and that if people make the wrong decision, that's okay, because
[02:22.820 --> 02:27.340]  the decision is more important than even the destination.
[02:27.340 --> 02:33.540]  You've heard the journey is the destination, and that really is true, isn't it?
[02:33.540 --> 02:39.380]  Now that said, we have a spectrum of news, because I've been up working since 5.30 this
[02:39.380 --> 02:44.500]  morning, 5.30, I almost overprepared like this when I'm on fire, I've been working
[02:44.500 --> 02:50.940]  since 5.30 this morning, I'm not bragging, it's the truth, actually 5.15, I'm on the
[02:50.940 --> 02:54.940]  crapper, I'm working, I'm cooking food for my kids, I'm working, I'm throwing my baby
[02:54.940 --> 03:06.340]  up in the air, I'm always working, but I've been really working since 5.15 this morning,
[03:06.340 --> 03:09.460]  so I've got a very, very clear picture of what's going on here.
[03:09.460 --> 03:14.860]  When we come back from break, I'm not going to do the normal thing where I mentioned some
[03:14.860 --> 03:26.220]  of what's coming up on the broadcast, because it's all important, but none of it is as paramount
[03:26.220 --> 03:34.740]  as Communist China openly threatening to attack the United States.
[03:34.740 --> 03:38.340]  By the way, I know you guys gave me like four copies of that when I printed it, it's a zero
[03:38.340 --> 03:43.380]  hedge article, oh, there it is, okay, I found it, and when you got like 200 articles in
[03:43.380 --> 03:47.060]  front of you, no matter if I looked at them all five, six times a day and read half of
[03:47.060 --> 03:53.740]  them, scanned the other half, it just turns into a tornado of information.
[03:53.740 --> 03:57.420]  And then I kind of know why the average person doesn't want to spend all their hours researching
[03:57.420 --> 04:02.740]  this, because you're either in this game of total war for humanity, or you're not in
[04:02.740 --> 04:10.140]  this game, because it really is true that life is war, and everything intermittent between
[04:10.140 --> 04:13.860]  times of war is nothing but preparation for the next war.
[04:13.860 --> 04:21.660]  And if you don't realize that, well, you really don't realize how the universe works, just
[04:21.660 --> 04:24.340]  what is war?
[04:24.340 --> 04:29.580]  We think of war as tanks and troops bombing each other, but no, war is struggle, war is
[04:29.580 --> 04:39.060]  competition, war is the exercise of what works best, and when you remove war, you bring in
[04:39.060 --> 04:42.500]  a stagnation that is the final war of extinction.
[04:42.500 --> 04:49.620]  So I seek to end physical war, but I seek to augment an intensified daily war, both
[04:49.620 --> 04:54.100]  ritualized and real, to help us accelerate to the next level, because it's only through
[04:54.100 --> 05:00.780]  struggle that we become stronger, everyone knows that.

[06:01.940 --> 06:07.260]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars, and in the
[06:07.260 --> 06:13.740]  decade since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates,
[06:13.740 --> 06:19.660]  tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting
[06:19.660 --> 06:22.540]  from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[06:22.540 --> 06:27.860]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering
[06:27.860 --> 06:33.460]  breaking news, live coverage of special events, and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere
[06:33.460 --> 06:34.460]  else.
[06:34.460 --> 06:39.500]  While the old-guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape brought by innovation
[06:39.500 --> 06:45.260]  and technology, InfoWars has been at the forefront of the Information Revolution.
[06:45.260 --> 06:50.900]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views
[06:50.900 --> 06:57.060]  of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[06:57.060 --> 07:03.180]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis for high-profile interviews and bombshell

[07:12.140 --> 07:17.780]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today, is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front
[07:17.780 --> 07:24.940]  lines of the InfoWars.
[07:24.940 --> 07:31.300]  It's Sunday, January 6, 2019, I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm honored and blessed to
[07:31.300 --> 07:33.300]  be here.
[07:33.300 --> 07:40.100]  We've had everything from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Texas Monthly try
[07:40.100 --> 07:44.140]  to piss down the backs of the American people and tell them that InfoWars had a horrible
[07:44.140 --> 07:45.700]  year.
[07:45.700 --> 07:53.060]  InfoWars had an amazing year of being directly over the target and predicting the launch
[07:53.060 --> 07:58.180]  of nationalism worldwide, the rebirth of populism, and that the globalists would try to kill
[07:58.180 --> 08:00.780]  the economy and that they would try to collapse our borders.
[08:00.780 --> 08:04.700]  We're proud to be here telling the truth.
[08:04.700 --> 08:08.300]  We're proud to be here standing firm for this nation.
[08:08.300 --> 08:12.940]  Now, I have a lot of incredible stuff to break down today.
[08:12.940 --> 08:13.940]  I'm particularly prepared.
[08:13.940 --> 08:19.540]  You could say I've been in Fuego lately when it comes to research.
[08:19.540 --> 08:28.340]  I was researching at midnight last night, and I was up at 5.15 researching because there's
[08:28.340 --> 08:29.340]  a quickening happening.
[08:29.340 --> 08:36.260]  So, before I hit this whole constellation of news and incredible illustrative information,
[08:36.260 --> 08:40.900]  let me hit the number one story first, and then I'll get to the traders.
[08:40.900 --> 08:46.900]  While this country is in such an incredible existential battle for all our futures that
[08:46.900 --> 08:53.860]  are working at this country at this critical time, it's just flabbergasting.
[08:53.860 --> 08:57.700]  It'd be one thing to be working for another system if you're just a sociopath who's giving
[08:57.700 --> 09:05.340]  more power, but this destroys you, but it's part of the mental illness.
[09:05.340 --> 09:11.220]  As usual, I talk about Drudge Report and Drudge being really smart, doing a great job, but
[09:11.220 --> 09:15.860]  man, zero hedge, and I do know who runs it now.
[09:15.860 --> 09:19.140]  Most folks don't.
[09:19.140 --> 09:24.420]  And it's just so on target that I sleep good at night knowing there's other people out
[09:24.420 --> 09:27.860]  there that get it.
[09:27.860 --> 09:30.860]  Now, because you'd think this would be top story on the New York Times, the Washington
[09:30.860 --> 09:31.860]  Post.
[09:31.860 --> 09:37.220]  I saw this this morning, and I went, wow, let me type that in to Google and Bing, and there
[09:37.220 --> 09:38.820]  was nothing being said.
[09:38.820 --> 09:41.660]  And I said, well, I don't just believe zero hedge.
[09:41.660 --> 09:46.180]  I said, not that they're bad, but Ronald Reagan said trust me, verify.
[09:46.180 --> 09:48.460]  So I searched what they said, and guess what?
[09:48.460 --> 09:53.140]  It was in the People's Daily, it was in the official statements of the Communist Party
[09:53.140 --> 09:54.140]  of China.
[09:54.140 --> 09:56.460]  And in fact, I'd seen a lot of this the last week.
[09:56.460 --> 10:01.180]  The dictator for life, Xi, Shang, he'll, hey, we already took over Hong Kong will invade
[10:01.180 --> 10:06.500]  Taiwan, which we have a defense agreement with, and West weapons, including high tech
[10:06.500 --> 10:11.540]  anti-aircraft and anti-ship.
[10:11.540 --> 10:15.540]  And that was a whole story in and of itself that he's threatening, oh, I'm sorry, not
[10:15.540 --> 10:22.420]  just to invade Taiwan and meeting at the big communist bureau with live video feeds with
[10:22.420 --> 10:23.420]  them chanting.
[10:23.420 --> 10:24.420]  We're ready for war.
[10:24.420 --> 10:30.940]  It's on news wars.com and for wars.com right now.
[10:30.940 --> 10:33.780]  There's almost no US media coverage.
[10:33.780 --> 10:42.820]  And if there is, it's pro Beijing, I mean, it's like this one story.
[10:42.820 --> 10:45.260]  I could do 10 hours emergency broadcast on air.
[10:45.260 --> 10:46.820]  Oh my God, look at their weapons.
[10:46.820 --> 10:53.020]  Do you know what they're doing?
[10:53.020 --> 10:57.020]  But let's just get into this one piece of news.
[10:57.020 --> 11:02.180]  Our border collapsing, China and the EU trying to kill our economy, Trump valiantly battling
[11:02.180 --> 11:04.460]  under attack internal and external.
[11:04.460 --> 11:12.100]  How could you not have your heart skip a beat when you know Trump's for your own interest?
[11:12.100 --> 11:14.020]  And now they're trying to kill the economy.
[11:14.020 --> 11:20.540]  It's just, it's crazy is what it is because this should be cut and dry.
[11:20.540 --> 11:27.180]  So zero hedge power Durkin in landmark speech, G threatens violence against Taiwan.
[11:27.180 --> 11:28.740]  And I didn't just believe this.
[11:28.740 --> 11:33.900]  I went and read it, the damn commie newspaper demands peaceful reunification.
[11:33.900 --> 11:36.660]  So he says we're ready to invade Taiwan.
[11:36.660 --> 11:38.460]  We're ready to blast US forces.
[11:38.460 --> 11:41.540]  We're ready to invade wherever we want.
[11:41.540 --> 11:46.940]  Taiwan said we're going to take islands and physically hold them that in 2000 year old
[11:46.940 --> 11:51.300]  maps, the Chinese never even laid claim to in the Philippines.
[11:51.300 --> 11:54.420]  Oh, I'm sure the Filipinos will roll over to that.
[11:54.420 --> 11:55.780]  I'm joking.
[11:55.780 --> 12:00.700]  Didn't go too well for the Japanese.
[12:00.700 --> 12:03.180]  So this guy is on his power trip.
[12:03.180 --> 12:06.940]  And let's go through this article, him at the meetings, the videos, shows TV viewers
[12:06.940 --> 12:10.900]  because he's up there with all of them lined up there, weird black suits and everything.
[12:10.900 --> 12:14.820]  When you read these quotes by him and he says we've already taken Hong Kong, we're going
[12:14.820 --> 12:15.820]  to take Taiwan.
[12:15.820 --> 12:17.620]  We'll use forces if we need to.
[12:17.620 --> 12:19.260]  Our militaries are based there.
[12:19.260 --> 12:24.660]  If the US tries to block us and he lists these islands that are down in Vietnam and off the
[12:24.660 --> 12:25.660]  coast.
[12:25.660 --> 12:30.420]  We're talking like hundreds of yards off the coast of the Philippines that we're going
[12:30.420 --> 12:32.180]  to start attacking US ships.
[12:32.180 --> 12:33.820]  So here's the announcement.
[12:33.820 --> 12:44.660]  The dictator who heads up a communist dictatorship that's killed five times what Hitler did
[12:44.660 --> 12:51.780]  is threatening to preemptively invade Taiwan and attack the United States.
[12:51.780 --> 12:55.540]  And that's not the top story in the United States.
[12:55.540 --> 12:59.180]  It's a billion, 400 million people.
[12:59.180 --> 13:01.140]  They've got thousands of nuclear weapons.
[13:01.140 --> 13:04.580]  They've got missiles that can hit us because Clinton gave it to him.
[13:04.580 --> 13:06.580]  And he's on television.
[13:06.580 --> 13:08.220]  Let me show you this article from Zero Edge.
[13:08.220 --> 13:10.540]  Again, my printout didn't do it, but you scroll down.
[13:10.540 --> 13:11.540]  It's not just him here.
[13:11.540 --> 13:15.220]  It's them all with the military standing and him in the middle and it's got his videos
[13:15.220 --> 13:16.220]  of his statements.
[13:16.220 --> 13:24.820]  I spent two hours today checking all this to make sure it was accurate, two hours.
[13:24.820 --> 13:25.820]  And I'm not complaining.
[13:25.820 --> 13:29.740]  I'm just saying the average American better start getting what's going on.
[13:29.740 --> 13:31.140]  They've been shooting at our ships.
[13:31.140 --> 13:32.580]  They've been attacking our submarines.
[13:32.580 --> 13:37.820]  And man, in some cases, they're 800 miles away from China.
[13:37.820 --> 13:40.540]  Now, there's the photo.
[13:40.540 --> 13:47.180]  And then he goes over it as a video newscast threatening to preemptively attack the US.
[13:47.180 --> 13:50.460]  I mean, this is like way past the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[13:50.460 --> 13:54.700]  This is insane.
[13:54.700 --> 13:57.380]  And there's almost nothing on our news.
[13:57.380 --> 13:58.980]  It's like, well, Trump screwed up.
[13:58.980 --> 14:00.340]  You know, he'll deal with him.
[14:00.340 --> 14:01.340]  And I read Reuters.
[14:01.340 --> 14:03.020]  Yeah, she was at Davos again.
[14:03.020 --> 14:04.020]  They're all behind him.
[14:04.020 --> 14:05.020]  Oh, thank God.
[14:05.020 --> 14:06.020]  She bought a polly.
[14:06.020 --> 14:09.740]  Well, we'll beat these American upstarts and we'll beat these.
[14:09.740 --> 14:11.860]  I read it in their policy papers.
[14:11.860 --> 14:16.860]  The professors go, there's a crisis in America led by Trump and Alex Jones and people like
[14:16.860 --> 14:17.860]  Tucker Carlson.
[14:17.860 --> 14:22.700]  And we're going to working with other partners like Juncker and she will stop it.
[14:22.700 --> 14:28.340]  I mean, it's like the stuff out of a science fiction comic book.
[14:28.340 --> 14:30.020]  But this is Hollywood.
[14:30.020 --> 14:31.020]  This is the universe.
[14:31.020 --> 14:36.420]  These, they literally romanticized China that is the most racist, hateful, murderous country
[14:36.420 --> 14:37.420]  on earth.
[14:37.420 --> 14:38.420]  Chinese people are good on average.
[14:38.420 --> 14:43.660]  But I'm just saying towards the lower class, towards anybody that's a Chinese, oh my God,
[14:43.660 --> 14:48.980]  it is the craziest Stockholm syndrome I've ever seen.
[14:48.980 --> 14:55.820]  And that's just one story, you know, repertoire today.
[14:55.820 --> 15:00.740]  And you know, Trump could be a jerk, but she's not.
[15:00.740 --> 15:04.860]  And if he was standing for sovereignty in our jobs and against the, the chai com threat,
[15:04.860 --> 15:05.860]  I would stand with him.
[15:05.860 --> 15:10.220]  But instead, I cannot believe that, but you know, you know what it is, people put their
[15:10.220 --> 15:11.220]  finger in the wind.
[15:11.220 --> 15:14.180]  They go, and they go, okay, we got Hollywood.
[15:14.180 --> 15:15.180]  We got the EU.
[15:15.180 --> 15:16.180]  We got the big bags.
[15:16.180 --> 15:17.180]  We got this.
[15:17.180 --> 15:18.180]  The public's weak.
[15:18.180 --> 15:19.180]  We got China.

[18:05.740 --> 18:10.940]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.940 --> 18:17.740]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.740 --> 18:23.620]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.620 --> 18:26.940]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.940 --> 18:31.860]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[18:31.860 --> 18:38.220]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:38.220 --> 18:41.780]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.780 --> 18:46.540]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.540 --> 18:52.340]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.340 --> 18:55.060]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[20:58.820 --> 21:25.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[21:25.620 --> 21:32.020]  But here is the bombshell of bombshells that we're going to show you live on radio and
[21:32.020 --> 21:33.020]  TV right now.
[21:33.020 --> 21:36.140]  For TV viewers, you'll be able to see this, for radio listeners, I'll describe how you
[21:36.140 --> 21:37.140]  do this.
[21:37.140 --> 21:41.340]  Let's pull up Google live on screen right now if we can.
[21:41.340 --> 21:46.380]  You've heard how Chinese began to make fun of the Chinese dictator because he sounds in
[21:46.380 --> 21:53.020]  Chinese like Winnie the Pooh, oh hello, Christopher Waban, that's how they think he sounds.
[21:53.020 --> 21:58.460]  And they are Chinese and they think that Winnie the Pooh sounds like him and he sounds
[21:58.460 --> 21:59.460]  like that.
[21:59.460 --> 22:05.020]  That's a death penalty if you talk like Winnie the Pooh, oh Christopher Waban, oh Tigger,
[22:05.020 --> 22:14.020]  huh, oh I'm Tigger, well earlier last year, 2018, the Taiwanese flag couldn't be seen
[22:14.020 --> 22:22.420]  on any iPhone devices as an emoji to the removing basically symbols of language now.
[22:22.420 --> 22:24.940]  That'll probably replace the alphabet as emojis soon.
[22:24.940 --> 22:29.260]  Well, here's the new big breaking news that our own crew has discovered.
[22:29.260 --> 22:34.860]  As of January 6th, 2019, let's put it live on screen.
[22:34.860 --> 22:42.620]  You can type in G threatens violence in Taiwan, G this, G that, but you can't type in G evil
[22:42.620 --> 22:44.300]  or a bunch of other terms.
[22:44.300 --> 22:50.780]  Go test it for yourself, Google is actively censoring search engines in America and in
[22:50.780 --> 22:57.820]  the West and then going to Congress with Sundar Pachai a month ago and saying we don't fix
[22:57.820 --> 23:02.060]  any search results when their own memos show it.
[23:02.060 --> 23:03.380]  Look at that.
[23:03.380 --> 23:04.380]  So blow that up on screen.
[23:04.380 --> 23:05.380]  We don't need me on there.
[23:05.380 --> 23:07.860]  Go full screen for TV viewers.
[23:07.860 --> 23:17.700]  You can type in G Jinping and Confucius in Taiwan and concession speech and Winnie the
[23:17.700 --> 23:24.660]  Pooh and trade war, but you put in evil G Jinping.
[23:24.660 --> 23:26.420]  And we were testing a bunch of other terms.
[23:26.420 --> 23:29.060]  It doesn't exist.
[23:29.060 --> 23:30.460]  Return the sender.
[23:30.460 --> 23:32.060]  No such number.
[23:32.060 --> 23:34.220]  This is the technocracies power.
[23:34.220 --> 23:35.980]  This is insane.
[23:35.980 --> 23:41.340]  This is dangerous and Google and Apple have all moved there and given them the code keys.
[23:41.340 --> 23:44.460]  Oh, there's a really ridiculous story I'll get to later.
[23:44.460 --> 23:49.860]  Apple plasters privacy ad on billboard near Las Vegas convention center ahead of CES
[23:49.860 --> 23:51.340]  big conference.
[23:51.340 --> 23:54.220]  It says what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone.
[23:54.220 --> 23:55.220]  No it doesn't.
[23:55.220 --> 23:57.500]  It all goes to the cloud.
[23:57.500 --> 24:01.700]  And a year ago they moved to China and gave them the code keys of the government and
[24:01.700 --> 24:05.540]  said we're now state run to be tax exempt.
[24:05.540 --> 24:09.700]  So what you do on your iPhone stays in Beijing.
[24:09.700 --> 24:11.700]  Wow.
[24:11.700 --> 24:14.900]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is incredible.
[24:14.900 --> 24:17.100]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is insane.
[24:17.100 --> 24:25.460]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, was done in live time with you watching.
[24:25.460 --> 24:30.500]  Covered a Texas monthly carpet bagger publication to come here and control Texas on record
[24:30.500 --> 24:35.540]  anti-gun, anti-family, totally anti-Republican cover story with nothing but lies about me
[24:35.540 --> 24:36.540]  and my family.
[24:36.540 --> 24:40.420]  But I don't see that as, oh my God, I'm on the cover of magazine lying about me.
[24:40.420 --> 24:43.980]  I see that as I'm a faithful American that stands up for what's truth.
[24:43.980 --> 24:47.220]  So they lie and say a bunch of things that I hate the U.S. military.
[24:47.220 --> 24:50.900]  And I said the U.S. military is coming to kill Texas in 2015.
[24:50.900 --> 24:51.900]  There's no video.
[24:51.900 --> 24:53.140]  There's no text.
[24:53.140 --> 24:54.140]  There's nothing.
[24:54.140 --> 24:59.780]  And they say all these other lies about me because they know I'm a faithful, good American.
[24:59.780 --> 25:00.780]  Tell the truth.
[25:00.780 --> 25:07.420]  I don't see that as how you're taking it that a few family called up was in Walmart and
[25:07.420 --> 25:12.100]  I saw Texas monthly when you on the cover of it, it's just, well, how are you doing?
[25:12.100 --> 25:13.700]  I mean, I'm doing damn well.
[25:13.700 --> 25:19.300]  You think George Washington wasn't on the cover of magazines in England in 1778?
[25:19.300 --> 25:24.540]  I'm not comparing myself to George Washington, but you know, if you're not on the cover of
[25:24.540 --> 25:28.500]  the enemy's newspaper, then you're not doing your damn job.
[25:28.500 --> 25:31.140]  I'm not playing games here.
[25:31.140 --> 25:33.140]  I'm not trying to social climb.
[25:33.140 --> 25:36.500]  I'm just a common sensor that's like, wow, the chai comms are threatening to totally
[25:36.500 --> 25:37.500]  destroy us.
[25:37.500 --> 25:39.740]  We've got all these enemies that hate America.
[25:39.740 --> 25:40.740]  They tell lies constantly.
[25:40.740 --> 25:42.740]  I'm not putting up with it.
[25:42.740 --> 25:43.740]  All right.
[25:43.740 --> 25:45.820]  That's my breakdown on the China thing.
[25:45.820 --> 25:47.300]  It is incredible.
[25:47.300 --> 25:49.900]  1.4 billion people.
[25:49.900 --> 25:53.020]  Their government's killed undebated.
[25:53.020 --> 25:59.460]  The Chinese government admits this five times what Hitler did.
[25:59.460 --> 26:04.260]  Hitler's a bad ombre, bad, bad person.
[26:04.260 --> 26:08.260]  I almost don't exist because of Hitler, both my grandfather's Army Air Corps.
[26:08.260 --> 26:12.020]  That's why when I see the news, Jones is like Hitler and they don't look, well, show me
[26:12.020 --> 26:13.020]  how I'm like Hitler.
[26:13.020 --> 26:14.900]  Did I work for Hitler like George Soros?
[26:14.900 --> 26:15.900]  Oh no.
[26:15.900 --> 26:16.900]  Yeah.
[26:16.900 --> 26:24.260]  There's a lot of graphs out there that show which dictator was the worst and it goes
[26:24.260 --> 26:25.260]  at the end of it.
[26:25.260 --> 26:26.900]  It goes Hitler, Stalin, Mao.
[26:26.900 --> 26:27.900]  That's accurate.
[26:27.900 --> 26:31.420]  And of course, then they killed tens of millions after he left.
[26:31.420 --> 26:38.140]  And the Chinese government publishes books saying they killed 115 mil.
[26:38.140 --> 26:40.620]  The CIA says it's 97 mil.
[26:40.620 --> 26:42.020]  I don't know who's right.
[26:42.020 --> 26:46.260]  It's kind of like, oh, 97 mil, 115 mil.
[26:46.260 --> 26:48.020]  Stalin said one man dies.
[26:48.020 --> 26:49.900]  It's a tragedy.
[26:49.900 --> 26:51.140]  A million dies is a statistic.
[26:51.140 --> 26:54.020]  See, I don't think like that, but they know the public does.
[26:54.020 --> 26:58.620]  It's like they'll take one person that dies and make it the ultimate, whatever happened.
[26:58.620 --> 27:04.700]  Like, I'm not a Serb, but the UN even admits that the Muslims in Albania started the war,
[27:04.700 --> 27:12.780]  the UN funded it, double the Serbs died that Croats or Muslims died.
[27:12.780 --> 27:16.820]  But our government did two wars, bombed them with DU, killed a bunch of people to turn
[27:16.820 --> 27:19.820]  over a third of Serbia to Muslims.
[27:19.820 --> 27:26.100]  And then the official accounts are the Muslims started it and they killed double.
[27:26.100 --> 27:27.740]  And did the Serbs do some atrocities?
[27:27.740 --> 27:28.580]  Damn right they did.
[27:28.580 --> 27:29.580]  They're not defending it.
[27:29.580 --> 27:32.780]  But it's like this, it's this weird thing where, here's an example.
[27:32.780 --> 27:36.100]  This poor little black girl last week got shot in Houston and the news said it was a
[27:36.100 --> 27:38.980]  white guy and they said, oh my God, white supremacist out and all the stuff.
[27:38.980 --> 27:43.100]  And then Saturday they busted the guy or he admitted to doing it.
[27:43.100 --> 27:44.100]  He's a black guy.
[27:44.100 --> 27:45.580]  He thought it was another drug dealer car.
[27:45.580 --> 27:51.020]  And this today, a day later, the news just said, oh, the killer's captured.
[27:51.020 --> 27:52.740]  I kept looking like, where's his name?
[27:52.740 --> 27:53.740]  Where's his mug shot?
[27:53.740 --> 27:59.460]  And I had to go to local Texas news in Houston to fire them being arraigned and brought in
[27:59.460 --> 28:03.140]  Saturday and here he is and black out on the news.
[28:03.140 --> 28:05.100]  No pun intended.
[28:05.100 --> 28:09.180]  Because the leftist media had the narrative that an evil white man was out killing black
[28:09.180 --> 28:10.460]  people and they were going to say it.
[28:10.460 --> 28:13.940]  And when it turned out to be a black guy and a case of mistaken identity, they weren't
[28:13.940 --> 28:15.060]  going to cover it.
[28:15.060 --> 28:16.900]  They weren't going to touch it.
[28:16.900 --> 28:18.220]  They weren't even going to retract it.
[28:18.220 --> 28:23.620]  And once it became a big issue, they went, okay, let's just kill this thing.
[28:23.620 --> 28:29.260]  I don't care if it's a white guy or a black guy or a purple guy or a polka-dotted person
[28:29.260 --> 28:30.860]  that kills any child.
[28:30.860 --> 28:31.860]  I care.
[28:31.860 --> 28:33.740]  Isn't it that simple?
[28:33.740 --> 28:34.740]  Even it was a white guy.
[28:34.740 --> 28:35.740]  When he's a crackhead, whatever.
[28:35.740 --> 28:38.980]  Why did they originally say it's a white guy and he hates black people?
[28:38.980 --> 28:39.980]  Because that's the narrative.
[28:39.980 --> 28:40.980]  All right.
[28:40.980 --> 28:41.980]  All right.
[28:41.980 --> 28:43.980]  I've hit the big China news when we get back.
[28:43.980 --> 28:47.420]  We're going to look at the next level and by the way, we're going to break some major
[28:47.420 --> 28:51.220]  Elizabeth Warren news, global exclusive.
[28:51.220 --> 28:53.780]  This is as big as the Pocahontas crowd.
[28:53.780 --> 28:59.580]  This is big medicine, big wampum.
[28:59.580 --> 29:02.900]  Defeat the globalist, hashtag Alex Jones.
[29:02.900 --> 29:06.460]  Defeat the pedophiles, hashtag Alex Jones.
[29:06.460 --> 29:11.420]  Defeat Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[29:11.420 --> 29:14.980]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[29:14.980 --> 29:19.060]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger
[29:19.060 --> 29:23.700]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[29:23.700 --> 29:28.460]  I am patient zero in the mass of banning, but you can override the censors now and if
[29:28.460 --> 29:34.020]  all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[29:34.020 --> 29:37.940]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[29:37.940 --> 29:43.900]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[29:43.900 --> 29:48.580]  Call it, talk radio, C-span, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[29:48.580 --> 29:52.740]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[29:52.740 --> 30:00.420]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[30:00.420 --> 30:05.860]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos,
[30:05.860 --> 30:08.100]  you are changing the world?
[30:08.100 --> 30:11.820]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist.
[30:11.820 --> 30:16.380]  It is you, the Info Warriors, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[30:16.380 --> 30:20.700]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[30:20.700 --> 30:25.140]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[30:25.140 --> 30:26.620]  You are the InfoWars.
[30:26.620 --> 30:31.220]  Now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[30:31.220 --> 30:36.300]  go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[30:36.300 --> 30:42.460]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[30:42.460 --> 30:47.700]  Now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos,
[30:47.700 --> 30:50.940]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[30:50.940 --> 30:57.180]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[30:57.180 --> 31:00.260]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[31:00.260 --> 31:04.660]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[31:04.660 --> 31:09.340]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[31:09.340 --> 31:10.860]  to detoxify the body.
[31:10.860 --> 31:15.740]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[31:15.740 --> 31:17.260]  It's made in the USA.
[31:17.260 --> 31:22.180]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[31:22.180 --> 31:24.020]  the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[31:24.020 --> 31:26.260]  It is a classical 360 win.
[31:26.260 --> 31:30.780]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[31:30.780 --> 31:35.420]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[31:35.420 --> 31:36.420]  get.
[31:36.420 --> 31:39.660]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[31:39.660 --> 31:44.700]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[31:44.700 --> 31:49.940]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[31:49.940 --> 31:52.660]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[31:52.660 --> 31:55.940]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[31:55.940 --> 32:23.620]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfoWarsLive.com.
[32:23.620 --> 32:27.900]  Get my knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's
[32:27.900 --> 32:29.300]  finest coffee bean.
[32:29.300 --> 32:34.540]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used in big agricultural productions, Patriot
[32:34.540 --> 32:40.020]  Blend coffees have a smooth, bold flavor with great depth to give you just what you need
[32:40.020 --> 32:41.020]  in the morning.
[32:41.020 --> 32:45.660]  You can even choose to start your morning healthier with the Immune Support Blend, infused with
[32:45.660 --> 32:49.060]  a powerful blend to support your immune response and stamina.
[32:49.060 --> 32:51.540]  It's time to take care of your morning routine.
[32:51.540 --> 32:55.840]  Get a bag of Patriot Blend coffee to support the show while enhancing your morning routine
[33:21.940 --> 33:23.540]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:39.540 --> 33:43.580]  So you'd think of the most populous nation in the world that controls most of the
[33:43.580 --> 33:48.020]  trainable planet and has a bunch of nuclear weapons is threatening to attack U.S. forces
[33:48.020 --> 33:50.540]  and saying they're now at war with the U.S.
[33:50.540 --> 33:52.780]  That's what the dictator said.
[33:52.780 --> 33:55.140]  You'd think that might be on U.S. news.
[33:55.140 --> 33:56.140]  Nothing.
[33:56.140 --> 33:59.340]  We'll be covering in here right through the evening or obviously tomorrow with the weekday
[33:59.340 --> 34:05.740]  show, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central, and of course David Knight's had a heart attack and does
[34:05.740 --> 34:07.980]  a great job and he's got a couple stints in.
[34:07.980 --> 34:08.980]  He'll be back in a month.
[34:08.980 --> 34:09.980]  He wants to come back.
[34:09.980 --> 34:13.140]  We're really welcoming him and tell him it takes as much time as he wants.
[34:13.140 --> 34:16.900]  We've got a lot of great co-hosts covering things at 8 a.m. every morning until I come
[34:16.900 --> 34:21.540]  out of 11 to get the war room with Owen Shroyer and his other co-hosts with him, like Roger
[34:21.540 --> 34:26.380]  Stone, kind of a who's who with the resistance and who's being targeted obviously because
[34:26.380 --> 34:27.380]  we're effective.
[34:27.380 --> 34:29.460]  I figured it out yet.
[34:29.460 --> 34:35.380]  I work with who is effective, who tells the truth, who isn't afraid, who's fearless
[34:35.380 --> 34:37.380]  because I am afraid of fear.
[34:37.380 --> 34:41.140]  All right, let's get down to it.
[34:41.140 --> 34:44.540]  Let's illustrate the Democrats' new technique.
[34:44.540 --> 34:47.740]  We know it's race-baiting, we know it's class warfare, that we know that's them telling
[34:47.740 --> 34:54.460]  us how great Venezuela and Cuba is or how Europe is collapsing and how great it is.
[34:54.460 --> 35:00.340]  But now we have Alexandre Cortez coming out and this is all over the news.
[35:00.340 --> 35:04.500]  I wasn't even going to cover this until earlier today, I had the television on, I was watching
[35:04.500 --> 35:12.660]  CNN and it was like, did you hear the Republicans say that women shouldn't be able to dance?
[35:12.660 --> 35:16.980]  And I've seen these headlines like Alex Jones believes women can't be doctors or lawyers
[35:16.980 --> 35:19.140]  or scientists.
[35:19.140 --> 35:20.140]  I never said that.
[35:20.140 --> 35:23.260]  I believe women are incredibly smart and if women want to be in those roles, more power
[35:23.260 --> 35:24.260]  to them.
[35:24.260 --> 35:27.260]  They shouldn't be forced out of traditional feminine roles.
[35:27.260 --> 35:33.900]  But it's all over the news, I've got a bunch of these clips where she puts out these cooking
[35:33.900 --> 35:40.620]  videos at her house that are canned and Elizabeth Warren copies them and then Peter O'Rourke
[35:40.620 --> 35:41.620]  copies them.
[35:41.620 --> 35:46.460]  I'm sorry, it's not Peter O, it's Beto O'Rourke, Beto O'Rourke, the guy they're going to push
[35:46.460 --> 35:47.460]  for president does it.
[35:47.460 --> 35:49.340]  So it's Warren, it's Cortez, it's him.
[35:49.340 --> 35:54.100]  They're clearly all trying to run for president even if she's too young under the constitutional
[35:54.100 --> 35:55.100]  amendment.
[35:55.100 --> 35:57.340]  She goes, oh, it's because it's anti-feminine or whatever.
[35:57.340 --> 36:01.420]  No, it's men and women can't run to the 35 ladies, that's the law.
[36:01.420 --> 36:07.260]  It's kind of smart, I don't think you want a president that's 34, you kind of do want
[36:07.260 --> 36:10.900]  to have some seasoning here, but okay, whatever.
[36:10.900 --> 36:17.260]  I sure as hell know this, I was smart at 35, a smarter and in business and life more successful
[36:17.260 --> 36:19.180]  than most 80 year olds.
[36:19.180 --> 36:27.220]  But I'm at 45, Alex Jones at 35, I'm 10 times smarter than that guy.
[36:27.220 --> 36:30.780]  I can't imagine what it would be like when I'm 70, but I guess your brain starts going
[36:30.780 --> 36:32.380]  so it kind of balances out.
[36:32.380 --> 36:37.980]  In my prime baby at 45, you know, 40 to 55, 60 is your prime.
[36:37.980 --> 36:41.100]  Alex Jones at 35 was a dumb son of a bitch.
[36:41.100 --> 36:44.620]  Sure, he was smarter than most people and had a lot of big trends and broke a lot of
[36:44.620 --> 36:47.940]  big news and had courage, but I'm not that guy.
[36:47.940 --> 36:49.340]  I'm Alex Jones at 45.
[36:49.340 --> 36:52.620]  So yeah, Cortez, you should be able to run to president through your 35.
[36:52.620 --> 36:53.620]  I think that's smart.
[36:53.620 --> 36:56.060]  It's a little scary to have a 35 year old president.
[36:56.060 --> 36:58.620]  It'd be scary if I was 45 at president.
[36:58.620 --> 37:00.340]  I mean, I kind of want that.
[37:00.340 --> 37:04.340]  Now that I know how much more knowledge you get in the way the world works and how you
[37:04.340 --> 37:09.220]  just go through more things and figure stuff out the seasoning, it's like good to have
[37:09.220 --> 37:11.060]  a 72 year old president, isn't it?
[37:11.060 --> 37:12.060]  Who's got stamina?
[37:12.060 --> 37:14.780]  Like he's a bull, he's strong and looks young.
[37:14.780 --> 37:15.780]  That even makes it better.
[37:15.780 --> 37:20.180]  But it's, it's, he figured a lot, like Trump even said, two years of campaigning, I'm a
[37:20.180 --> 37:21.180]  new person.
[37:21.180 --> 37:25.500]  Like before I liked God and I was a Christian, but I really liked God now because he had
[37:25.500 --> 37:26.500]  experiences that happened.
[37:26.500 --> 37:29.340]  And I, and by the way, I know those are real experiences, but I want to go off into some
[37:29.340 --> 37:30.340]  Trump speech.
[37:30.340 --> 37:36.780]  Let's get to court test, imagine the PR, let's have cookouts together.
[37:36.780 --> 37:37.780]  Yes.
[37:37.780 --> 37:38.780]  Look normal.
[37:38.780 --> 37:43.420]  Like we're normal people tried not wearing $4,000, $5,000 outfits lady.
[37:43.420 --> 37:47.860]  It's okay if you have those, just stop saying wealth is bad and then, you know, it's like
[37:47.860 --> 37:53.660]  the grandson of Hill Castro has been caught with his $5 million yacht and $4 million helicopters
[37:53.660 --> 37:58.860]  and $10 million jets and $20 million castles in Europe.
[37:58.860 --> 38:01.260]  And he quits it and Facebook said, I'm going to cover that later.
[38:01.260 --> 38:05.300]  And people are like, dude, Cubans are starving to death and they have nothing.
[38:05.300 --> 38:08.020]  And they don't even have, they can't even, well, where'd you get all this money?
[38:08.020 --> 38:11.260]  He's like, Oh, I got it from Fidel.
[38:11.260 --> 38:12.260]  They have no sense.
[38:12.260 --> 38:17.180]  It's like, if you're Alexander Cortez from a rich family claiming you're a bartender
[38:17.180 --> 38:23.820]  and all this crap, you don't want to wear $2,000 shoes, a $3,000 jacket and $1,000 pants.
[38:23.820 --> 38:26.740]  I mean, I'm wearing an $800 jacket.
[38:26.740 --> 38:30.380]  And when I got it, I felt guilty, but it fits my fat ass.
[38:30.380 --> 38:31.380]  And I do it.
[38:31.380 --> 38:32.740]  That's what tailored jackets are like.
[38:32.740 --> 38:34.500]  Most of my jackets are 400, 200 bucks.
[38:34.500 --> 38:39.100]  I mean, the point is I'm not like tweeting, Oh, look at my yacht or which I don't have
[38:39.100 --> 38:45.260]  or look at my big expensive shirt, but look, I'm digressing Cortez.
[38:45.260 --> 38:52.980]  Let's be clear comes out and says, and the media says, Alexander Cortez is being attacked
[38:52.980 --> 38:55.820]  everywhere because she danced.
[38:55.820 --> 39:00.620]  She did some stupid video, we're going to show you with, with, with Footloose audio
[39:00.620 --> 39:01.620]  over it.
[39:01.620 --> 39:02.620]  You're ready to listen.
[39:02.620 --> 39:03.620]  I'll describe it.
[39:03.620 --> 39:04.620]  It's on m4s.com.
[39:04.620 --> 39:05.620]  We're going to m4s.com.
[39:05.620 --> 39:06.620]  I should have seen it.
[39:06.620 --> 39:07.860]  She does this video.
[39:07.860 --> 39:11.500]  And then I look today, no one criticized it.
[39:11.500 --> 39:12.500]  No one.
[39:12.500 --> 39:13.500]  It's very cringe worthy though.
[39:13.500 --> 39:14.500]  I mean, it's very stupid.
[39:14.500 --> 39:21.300]  And then the democratic party goes, Republicans are mad that women are dancing.
[39:21.300 --> 39:25.540]  Are these Republicans that got in the time machine and went back maybe 50, 60, 70 years
[39:25.540 --> 39:32.220]  to the smallest town, say in Oklahoma, the Republicans I know are the life of the party
[39:32.220 --> 39:33.220]  compared to Democrats.
[39:33.220 --> 39:36.460]  They're a bunch of nerds, Republicans party, baby.
[39:36.460 --> 39:38.060]  But the thing is, it's not true.
[39:38.060 --> 39:43.220]  So imagine the weird 80 year old people that wrote their part like, Shay, they're afraid
[39:43.220 --> 39:46.820]  of girls dancing and want to ban dancing.
[39:46.820 --> 39:49.140]  That'll get us the liberal vote.
[39:49.140 --> 39:55.260]  And so they just say that this Navy seal who lost his eye, he's afraid to dance.
[39:55.260 --> 40:02.260]  So Dan Crenshaw to Cortez, dancing, not scandalous, but your tax hikes are.
[40:02.260 --> 40:07.940]  So let's go ahead and go to the little footloose piece where they're literally making it up
[40:07.940 --> 40:13.300]  that Republicans are upset by her dancing the jig when no one looked at it and no one
[40:13.300 --> 40:14.300]  cared.
[40:14.300 --> 40:15.300]  This is the level of fraud.
[40:15.300 --> 40:16.300]  Here it is.
[40:16.300 --> 40:20.300]  From the oldest of times, people danced for a number of reasons.
[40:20.300 --> 40:30.020]  They danced in prayer or so their crops would be plentiful or so their hunt would be good.
[40:30.020 --> 40:37.900]  And they danced to stay physically fit and show their community spirit.
[40:37.900 --> 40:40.900]  And they danced to celebrate.
[40:40.900 --> 40:47.900]  And that is the dancing that we're talking about.
[40:47.900 --> 41:03.540]  The part we told in Psalm 149, praise you, the Lord, sing unto the Lord a new song.
[41:03.540 --> 41:05.660]  Let them praise his name in the dance.
[41:05.660 --> 41:06.660]  Amen.
[41:06.660 --> 41:17.660]  And it was King David, King David, who we read about in Samuel, and what did they mean
[41:17.660 --> 41:27.100]  liberal thing in the 80s, Republicans were banning dancing, those very small Puritan
[41:27.100 --> 41:35.500]  groups hundreds of years ago, like Hawaii, so this is left just claiming that the right
[41:35.500 --> 41:37.100]  wing was he was from dancing.
[41:37.100 --> 41:44.660]  Now we want to keep the left from teaching our five-year-olds how to slice you.
[41:44.660 --> 41:57.820]  So this is the playbook of the Democrats is claiming that Cortez, oh, she looks a little
[41:57.820 --> 41:59.140]  better with some weight on her there.
[41:59.140 --> 42:03.460]  I think she's ugly looking and bug-eyed, looks like some weird praying man is she's
[42:03.460 --> 42:04.780]  on drugs now.
[42:04.780 --> 42:10.020]  That girl on screen Cortez dancing is good looking.
[42:10.020 --> 42:13.260]  That girl could be president someday.
[42:13.260 --> 42:17.860]  So this is what they come up with, that Republicans are mad, oh, by the way, the latest thing
[42:17.860 --> 42:25.900]  we come back, just to illustrate it, is critics bash homophobe Mike Pence for uncomfortable
[42:25.900 --> 42:28.340]  behavior swearing in bisexual center.
[42:28.340 --> 42:32.740]  He's smiling, he's being nice, and they just make it up knowing you'll hear it on radio
[42:32.740 --> 42:33.940]  or hear it on TV.
[42:33.940 --> 42:34.940]  It's all fraud.
[42:34.940 --> 42:37.580]  It's like, did you hear a white supremacist kill the black girl?
[42:37.580 --> 42:38.740]  He was a black guy.
[42:38.740 --> 42:41.140]  They know it, CNN covered it up.
[42:41.140 --> 42:45.020]  Did you hear Trump took out the bust of Martin Luther King?
[42:45.020 --> 42:48.660]  Was it true?
[42:48.660 --> 42:49.660]  On and on and on and on.
[42:49.660 --> 42:54.900]  By the way, she's not a bad-looking woman, I'm sure Mike Pence has never heard of women
[42:54.900 --> 42:55.900]  with women.
[42:55.900 --> 42:59.420]  Oh, God, all men hate that, we just have heart attacks.
[42:59.420 --> 43:03.060]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our official oil formula or just want an

[45:00.100 --> 45:05.340]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[45:05.340 --> 45:10.700]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[45:10.700 --> 45:17.380]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[45:17.380 --> 45:23.260]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[45:23.260 --> 45:26.580]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[45:26.580 --> 45:31.260]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[45:31.260 --> 45:36.540]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[45:36.540 --> 45:37.540]  symptoms.
[45:37.540 --> 45:40.220]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[45:40.220 --> 45:41.460]  It is not an antihistamine.
[45:41.460 --> 45:46.140]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[45:46.140 --> 45:51.940]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[45:51.940 --> 45:54.620]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[45:54.620 --> 45:59.980]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block, chewable tablets.

[47:03.420 --> 47:15.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:52.320 --> 48:51.340] 's not about Alexander Cortez and the Democrats and the big talking point this
[48:51.340 --> 48:56.220]  weekend that Republicans want to stop women from dancing, and they use some comment on
[48:56.220 --> 49:00.740]  a message board they probably put themselves, oh look, someone said Alexander Cortez shouldn't
[49:00.740 --> 49:06.380]  be dancing, it's a stupid video, or dancing at the Capitol, can we play that for TV viewers?
[49:06.380 --> 49:07.940]  Very cringe-worthy.
[49:07.940 --> 49:11.580]  But it's cringe-worthy, she was like a praying mantis, those crazy eyes, I think she's on
[49:11.580 --> 49:13.980]  drugs personally.
[49:13.980 --> 49:20.740]  So oh my gosh, she does some stupid joke, I mean, let me copy that video, here it is.
[49:20.740 --> 49:31.860]  I mean, it's like a joke danced by an actor in Caddyshack, Rodney Dangerfield, he's acting
[49:31.860 --> 49:32.860]  stupid.
[49:32.860 --> 49:36.220]  I mean, it's kind of cool because it's so dumb, but they go, oh my god, the Republicans
[49:36.220 --> 49:42.140]  are scared of a woman dancing, oh yeah, and then it's made up, and it's like what mindset
[49:42.140 --> 49:47.460]  do these Democrats have, the ones that are calling the shots, that they think like it's
[49:47.460 --> 49:52.660]  dirty dancing, or it's like other movies where the Christians try to stop people that are
[49:52.660 --> 49:57.700]  all made up anyways, let's tell them that men don't want, Republicans don't want women
[49:57.700 --> 49:58.700]  to dance.
[49:58.700 --> 50:07.260]  And then you think, wait a minute, Nancy Pelosi's older than The Hills, you've got all this
[50:07.260 --> 50:15.180]  going on, and you look at the weird PR they come up with, and it's the same crazy stuff
[50:15.180 --> 50:23.020]  like they're back in the 1930s or something, where Pelosi, you heard about some school
[50:23.020 --> 50:28.220]  somewhere where they didn't let people dance, and then like today it's like, let's show
[50:28.220 --> 50:34.980]  them we're hip, yeah, they're trying to stop Cortez from dancing, what, what, we're trying
[50:34.980 --> 50:40.820]  to stop you from selling out the last jobs, and signing over to the chai comms, and taking
[50:40.820 --> 50:48.220]  our guns, and aborting the babies, you dumb witch, but see that's what they do, so it's
[50:48.220 --> 50:52.580]  all going to be just these little things where they go, anything they do, it's like, did
[50:52.580 --> 50:59.840]  you hear, Pence was really freaked out and super uncomfortable when he swore in this
[50:59.840 --> 51:05.100]  Democrat woman who made a big deal that she's bisexual, it's like, by the way, I'm bisexual,
[51:05.100 --> 51:09.540]  oh my God, oh, we better vote for you, it's not about your policy, it's like, by the
[51:09.540 --> 51:15.180]  way, I've gone down a lot of checks, I'm like, I have to, does that freak you out, oh my
[51:15.180 --> 51:19.220]  God, vote for me, like, Pence was freaked out when he met Jones, because Jones had gone
[51:19.220 --> 51:23.580]  down on, I mean, it's a family show, but this is what they inject, actually I've never had
[51:23.580 --> 51:28.620]  sex in my life, and I just dreamed about it once, I, the truth, you know, guys at Braga
[51:28.620 --> 51:36.820]  is never true, it's like, listen, I'm a Quaker, I'm a Puritan, no, seriously, you watch Pence,
[51:36.820 --> 51:40.540]  he's actually attracted to her, I've watched the video like 10 times, like, hey, how you
[51:40.540 --> 51:44.500]  doing, man, she's a young good-looking woman, he swears her in, he's doing this all day,
[51:44.500 --> 51:50.620]  just get it done, the media, USA Today, everything, it turns it into, did you see that homophobic
[51:50.620 --> 51:57.300]  piece of crap, wow, that little sweetheart, carpet muncher, came up there and here he
[51:57.300 --> 52:07.740]  comes right at her viciously, he is the biggest devil we've ever seen, critics bash homophobe
[52:07.740 --> 52:12.500]  Mike Pence for uncomfortable behavior, swearing in bisexual senator, and again, the point
[52:12.500 --> 52:20.740]  is, it's all fraud, no one cared that she was in a dance video, no one made an issue about
[52:20.740 --> 52:24.740]  that the woman said she's been with women, but that's what's perverted about it, is
[52:24.740 --> 52:31.020]  they're obsessed with sex, what are perverts, they're obsessed with sex, it's like they
[52:31.020 --> 52:35.340]  come up with this PR and it's about sex, sex, sex, how about the economy, how about our
[52:35.340 --> 52:38.780]  children, how about a future, how about not having toxic waste, how about going out for
[52:38.780 --> 52:42.500]  GMO, how about all the stuff going on, but instead it's the Democrats all day, I'm this
[52:42.500 --> 52:46.900]  color or this is who I have sex with, and at a certain point like, okay, cool, that's
[52:46.900 --> 52:52.540]  who you have sex with, just leave my kids, no, we're not going to leave your kids alone,
[52:52.540 --> 52:56.060]  and so Mike Pence is so uncomfortable, I watched this video now, like 10 times, I just played
[52:56.060 --> 52:59.980]  it five more times, for radio listeners, you're missing it, he looks more comfortable than
[52:59.980 --> 53:05.260]  usual, Mike Pence usually looks real uncomfortable, real uptight, you know, straight like sky,
[53:05.260 --> 53:09.700]  so let's play with audio for the viewers this incredible homophobic event, and I'll describe
[53:09.700 --> 53:11.180]  it for radio listeners, here it is.
[53:11.180 --> 53:25.860]  That you take this obligation free, about any mental reservation or purpose of evasion,
[53:25.860 --> 53:47.500]  I mean, most Democrats, Republicans look stuffed, shirt and weird, Democrats look like they
[53:47.500 --> 53:51.020]  escaped from a lunatic asylum, she's a pretty good looking woman and seems to have her act
[53:51.020 --> 53:57.180]  together, so I'm ready to vote Democrat right now, anyways, I'm not going to date with her,
[53:57.180 --> 54:02.100]  I'm married next, the point is, is that, but they're going to say we edited, that was unedited,
[54:02.100 --> 54:05.140]  can we play from the beginning, because we had a little computer problem, can we play
[54:05.140 --> 54:09.820]  this unedited, just back it up for 30 seconds, I want to watch them walk up, he's totally
[54:09.820 --> 54:14.340]  gracious, totally nice, and again, you're like, this is a petty issue, Alex, why cover
[54:14.340 --> 54:18.780]  it, that'll be in the comments, I'm supposed to video to m4wars.com, I know it's petty,
[54:18.780 --> 54:25.380]  that's what I mean, oh my gosh, Cortez is dancing, Republicans are upset, it's made up, oh my
[54:25.380 --> 54:31.020]  gosh, he hates her, because she told people she'd been with women, it's like, who tells
[54:31.020 --> 54:37.460]  people that, anyways, it's like, by the way, I've been with women, so I'm really cool,
[54:37.460 --> 54:41.500]  okay, great, she saved kids from a fire, she wrote a cool book, she wrote a nice song,
[54:41.500 --> 54:46.780]  got a great restaurant, I might be into you, you know, if I wasn't married, you look pretty
[54:46.780 --> 54:53.500]  hot lady, but the point is, I don't need to hear all day about how, you know, so let's
[54:53.500 --> 55:00.180]  play, this is the big scandal, this is the, it just shows the total hoax that, is the
[55:00.180 --> 55:06.020]  left totally insane or they think we're insane, where they put this out that here is the homophobia,
[55:06.020 --> 55:11.380]  when obviously Pence, who's a straight-laced Christian guy, is uncomfortable around a woman
[55:11.380 --> 55:15.500]  that's one of his peers, that's good looking, there's a little tension there, that's normal,
[55:15.500 --> 55:20.620]  he obviously likes her, any idiot could look at this video, he doesn't care what the hell
[55:20.620 --> 55:26.900]  she did with, you know, Sally Rottencrotch 20 years ago, here it is, congratulations,
[55:26.900 --> 55:39.980]  my great honor, let's do this, let's do this, what is this, why don't you stand, you'll
[55:39.980 --> 55:47.820]  be right here, can we get a spouse, just kidding, just kidding, so if you hold here, put your
[55:47.820 --> 55:53.420]  right hand in the air, and you'll be in there, and Pence obviously is attracted, okay, it's
[55:53.420 --> 55:57.860]  not, he's uncomfortable, because I've watched a lot of Pence videos, he's showing more
[55:57.860 --> 56:01.780]  interest normally than he ever does, everybody's been around drunk or anybody, I'm sure Pence
[56:01.780 --> 56:08.140]  has watched this, he said, honey, I think we know that Mike Pence is heterosexual,
[56:08.140 --> 56:15.020]  yeah, the real headline is, Mike Pence turned on by new female Democrat Senator, Christian
[56:15.020 --> 56:21.900]  Sena, he just throws her on the desk right there, I mean, I'm sorry it's a family show,
[56:21.900 --> 56:26.540]  but that's the takeaway here, just throws her right on the desk, alright, let's shut
[56:26.540 --> 56:31.020]  this down, okay, so I already covered China threatening to attack US forces in the South
[56:31.020 --> 56:36.540]  China Sea and to invade Taiwan, not even on US news, total freaking worldwide crisis,
[56:36.540 --> 56:41.220]  we already covered all sorts of insanity, but the next hour's coming up, and I'm going
[56:41.220 --> 56:48.580]  to get into inmates eat holiday steak during shutdown while prison guards go unpaid, Buzz
[56:48.580 --> 56:53.940]  grows the flying cars ahead of major tech show, MSNBC says Trump's wall is a monument
[56:53.940 --> 56:59.420]  to white nationalism, Phil Castro's model grandson runs around in his billion dollar
[56:59.420 --> 57:04.980]  lifestyle, freaking out economies, Goldman Sachs is up to it again, and so much more
[57:04.980 --> 57:11.140]  today and then, I shot a special report that's just now been completed, that we're going
[57:11.140 --> 57:18.540]  to air in the last two segments today that is powerful, and it's not an advertising
[57:18.540 --> 57:24.660]  gimmick, it was a year in sale, a free shipping store wide, 50 to 75% off, double page repoints
[57:24.660 --> 57:31.180]  and a free gift on every order, I've been so glued to news that you've all seen, I'm
[57:31.180 --> 57:34.460]  the guy that runs this whole damn show, I've not come up with a new specials, but you're
[57:34.460 --> 57:37.820]  going to be good, but not a substantive of this biggest sale ever, so I said this thing
[57:37.820 --> 57:42.820]  was going to yield in like Tuesday, it hasn't ended, but I'm going to be here at 8am tomorrow
[57:42.820 --> 57:47.660]  with a new special, so it will be over tomorrow, or a bunch of the stuff's already sold out,

[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:29.420]  You know, it was like two and a half years ago in the middle of the 2016 campaign, I was
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:33.900]  sitting there with my personal trainer that comes over at like 7.30 in the morning a few
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:38.980]  days a week trying to make me lift weights, Pat Riley, and I was watching Jimmy Kimmel
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:42.380]  and Hillary open a pickle jar to prove that she has this incredible prowess.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:48.100]  Anybody knows about pickle jars or jalapeno jars or anything can, every 30, 40 times you
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:53.660]  buy it, maybe once a year, twice a year, or you try to open it and you got to bang it
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.060]  on the table, whatever.
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:59.340]  So when I tried to do the test, I couldn't open it for it, it's kind of embarrassing,
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:04.260]  it was like, well you have to be, I was like, oh I have two other cans or two other bottles
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:08.420]  or two other jars, I got it right the third time so I could open it.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:14.900]  Well, Paul Watson, I'm already foreshadowing tomorrow, we're going to break this tomorrow,
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:21.020]  put out a thing about how fake Elizabeth Warren's little cooking show was, she copied Cortez
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:26.900]  and Pito or Orcon, but we caught her in something big that will break tomorrow that's just as
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.900]  big as Picklegate.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:31.700]  A little foreshadowing, tomorrow's news today, but first here it is.
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:40.900]  Hold on a sec, I'm going to get me a beer.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:47.620]  Hey, Robert, my husband Bruce is now in here.
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:52.420]  Oh my husband just happened to walk in, I have a husband so relatable, right?
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.420]  Do you want a beer?
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.820]  I'll pass on the beer for now.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:57.620]  We don't usually drink beer, what are you doing?
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:02.420]  So this is my sweetie, hello, I'm, and I'm crazy about it.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.420]  I love you so much.
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.420]  Thanks for being here.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.420]  Pleasure.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.420]  I'm glad you're here.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:08.420]  That just means they're like wherever she is.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:13.420]  They're like your own husband for being in your house, that's just weird.
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:28.820]  Yeah, that Bosnian war criminal looked more comfortable taking a swig of poison, she makes
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:35.100]  Mark Zuckerberg look human.
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:40.860]  How do you do, fellow kids, I am your new highly approachable candidate eager to share
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:41.860]  a beer.
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:44.620]  I'm going to get me a beer.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.260]  I'm going to get me a beer.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.260]  Yeah, you're an Ivy League professor, Elizabeth.
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:53.100]  We know you don't talk like that, so stop insulting our intelligence.
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:58.700]  Elizabeth Warren's trying to act like a normal person, pretending to be something she's not.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.940]  Now where have I seen that before?
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:06.220]  But wait, Native Americans and alcohol, probably not the best idea.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.060]  Um, hello.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:13.140]  Ah.
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:17.140]  Looks like when you buy your parents their first iPhone for Christmas and they realize
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.780]  it has a camera.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:24.540]  Uh, uh, oh, the future of politics is seeing out of touch elites trying to connect with
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:30.620]  the average people they lost by doing cringeworthy live streams of normalcy while appearing
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:35.340]  like psychopaths.
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.740]  Look at these scum filth.
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.340]  I mean, my God help us.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.340]  Robots to the corporates.
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:42.340]  These are just the front people.
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:48.340]  They hire people just like them because they're scum or empty.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.740]  I'm just chilling in Cedar Rapids.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:54.340]  How long before Warren whips out the hot sauce?
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.340]  Hot sauce.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:59.140]  And in case you missed it, she also has a husband so relatable.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.340]  Obviously has a f***er in 25 years.
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:05.700]  Also, did you know she has a dog so relatable?
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.300]  Oh, and she also has a husband.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.300]  I'm Elizabeth Warren.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.300]  This is my husband, Bruce.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.300]  Come up.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:13.300]  Look, my husband.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.300]  And a dog.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.780]  And this is Bailey, uh, who will be 80 years old tomorrow.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.780]  And husband.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:20.780]  He has a dog.
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:21.780]  I am human.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.780]  Wait.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.780]  What?
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.780]  I mean, literally.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.780]  This is like an alien invasion.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.780]  Oh, it's okay.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.380]  This is one 1024th woman of color, Elizabeth.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:34.620]  You're a 69-year-old multi-millionaire Harvard elitist.
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:41.420]  This video has less authenticity than your Native American heritage.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:45.580]  You're not going to out AOC, AOC, by awkwardly chugging a beer.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.780]  You're such a f***ing ho.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:48.780]  I love it.
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:53.020]  Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie.
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:58.260]  And she's a shriveled leftist, though.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:02.300]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:07.540]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:10.460]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:14.580]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.340]  gone through two permutations.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:21.460]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.420]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:28.260]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:29.260]  That's been incredible.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:34.620]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.900]  of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:41.340]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:47.420]  three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.900]  it even more bioavailable.
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:53.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:54.980]  discovery.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:06:22.300]  I'm Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWare.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:42.660]  When I get up here on this Sunday evening and I say this is the most demonized, most
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:48.820]  lied about, most attacked broadcast by the globalists, by the pedophiles that have seized
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:54.220]  control of Vatican, by the corrupt Jesuits, not all Jesuits are bad, but I mean the leftist
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:07:00.180]  of seats of Catholic Church, it's on record, by all these corrupt groups, by radical Islam,
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.180]  by Hollywood.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.820]  I mean, I'm just honored to be here.
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:09.700]  But I'm going to break down for you here in just a moment.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.180]  It's a really heavy inside baseball.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.700]  I'll do it the start of the next segment.
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:22.660]  On how this country stands on the knife's edge right now, on the head of a pen.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:33.580]  I already covered some pretty epic stuff last hour, but I also got into just the weirdness
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:47.020]  of the twisted follower class that the contorted soulless left has recruited.
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:53.780]  I mean the weird stuff they come up with and the formality and the centralization and just
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:54.780]  how they do it.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:08:07.540]  It's like watching Elizabeth Warren and Pito O'Rourke, I'm sorry, Bebo O'Rourke, his name,
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:17.780]  Harvard bagger down here in Texas, watching them try to act human and go, here's my husband,
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:23.180]  here's my dog, look, I drink beer and they like open the beer, like it's an alien.
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:28.740]  How do they know, actually the Battle of the Bulls, there was a famous case where Heinrich
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:37.660]  Himmler and others had trained, gotten a bunch of Nazi commandos trained to go behind enemy
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:45.180]  lines and to then pose as Americans to sabotage stuff, but then go, hi guys, we're here to
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.980]  get some petrol.
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:53.700]  And the US regular GIs would just kill them, so they've been told to look out for Germans
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:54.700]  posing as Americans.
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:09:02.500]  There's famous Hollywood examples of that, reenacting it, but hi guys, hi, we'd really
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:09.540]  like to get some petrol, and the GIs would just, they'd be German officers dressed up
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:15.820]  to, you know, get behind any lines and it's like hers, like, here's my dog, here's my
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:22.540]  husband, look, I open a can of beer with a flat top with my knuckles up, oh, it's so
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:28.820]  good, never fear, we're here to help you, and it's like, okay, they're not space aliens,
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:39.380]  but they're the most compliant corporate university, Harvard shills that will just do whatever
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.380]  they're told.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:43.940]  Take David Hogg, I never talked about this a few weeks ago, but let's talk about it
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:44.940]  now.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:49.540]  He failed trying to get into four universities, and then I was reading the news, it was like
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:50.540]  six more.
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:57.260]  So he tried to get into 10 universities, and his scores were that of a lobotomized monkey
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.260]  in my view.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:01.020]  I mean, they were real low.
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:08.220]  He was almost on the short bus, and I feel sorry for him for that, but it didn't matter
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:13.540]  because Harvard let him in because he's an establishment hack.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:18.940]  Oh, they won't let Japanese in, they won't let Chinese in because they'd be the whole
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:22.340]  university because they studied the hardest, worked the hardest, they actually said in
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:28.340]  a Harvard internal document came out last year in a lawsuit that Asians have a low
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:35.100]  human score, a comedy score, they're basically retarded, I don't believe in that, you know,
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:39.620]  my sister's Korean adopted, she's Americanized, she's just as funny as I am, and awesome.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:44.060]  It's those cultures over there were very competitive, that's where it is.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:50.740]  But imagine if I said Asians, you can actually type this in, lawsuit, Harvard documents Asians
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:54.540]  have low human score.
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:11:01.740]  So they can do all the math and do all the whatever it is and pass it, but Harvard says
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:02.740]  they're subhuman.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:07.180]  Oh, it's like, oh, of course you are.
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:12.100]  Because all the weird white leftists and black leftists and Hispanic leftists that are picked
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:18.700]  up by the globalists and put it there to be the new politicos, they know how to bend over
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.900]  and do what they're told.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:26.220]  They know how to go be in a little social clubs and play ball.
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:42.220]  So along comes David Hogg and he with his super low grade point average that I was looking
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:45.020]  at, it's like the lowest ever let into Harvard.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:51.060]  They don't let poor Appalachian white people, they don't let poor Alabama black people that
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:55.140]  had the government shooting them up with syphilis, you know, I think those, they might deserve
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:57.900]  a little, wouldn't call it affirmative action, you might have a certain percentage of the
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:00.740]  school that tries to bring in, you know, people that have been disadvantaged.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.580]  I kind of get that as an American.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:05.580]  I kind of get the idea, but see, it's not about that, about bringing people in and politically
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.340]  controlling them.
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:13.060]  And David Hogglet, a lot of times I'll see news and then don't cover for a month, but
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:21.300]  David Hogglet, Mr. Anti-Gun Michael Bloomberg spokesperson, he gets to get into Harvard
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:32.460]  at the lowest test scores they let in ever because he's David Hogg, yeah.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:38.140]  And I don't want to let a black person in Harvard just because they're a democratic
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:46.980]  talking point, but you know, it wouldn't be as bad as that chicken that actor, oh, the
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:49.260]  shootings happened, but they're in the acting club.
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:54.580]  He's an anti-gunner, he's picked 3,000 kids, they ignore, he's picked four kids to go tell
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:13:00.700]  us, we're the kids of Parkland and you turn your guns in, dammit.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:08.740]  And so his reward for crapping all over everybody is that all these other universities just saw
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:17.380]  scores and then he wasn't said, no, but Harvard said, David, we've got a place for you.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:23.420]  You read off talking points, you do all, you call for gun confiscation, you call for Alex
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:36.940]  Jones, we're taking off the gear, you are numeral uno, David Hogg, hell, it's like Obama
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:45.620]  got a peace prize when he was president of the elect and he launched 10 wars.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:52.380]  I think they ought to give them all just honorary doctor degrees from Harvard because Harvard
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.460]  already is a worthless joke degree.
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:58.500]  It literally is known as the Harvard mafia, but I'm digressing, I'm sorry.
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:03.740]  You know, I said I had all this news and boy, do I have a lot and I was a good person.
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:15.500]  I covered a lot of it in the last hour, but we're going to get to the real meat and potatoes,
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:26.900]  but I want you to know this tomorrow, unless I, you know, get abducted by a weird group
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:30.100]  of right-wingers of the band dancing like Cortez says this happened, doesn't exist,
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.540]  but whatever, maybe it does.
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:40.220]  Unless that happens, I will reveal the next level, the next twist in Elizabeth Warren
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.220]  fraud.
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.420]  This is as big as Pocahontasgate.
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:50.340]  By the way, demographers, geneticists were shocked that the average American, no matter
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:59.100]  where you're from, if your ancestors got here before 1900, you're about 1.3% Native American
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.100]  in genetic test.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:08.940]  We only have one side of the family that even tracked it and I'm 6%, 6.5%, about 13%, just
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:14.780]  on that Comanche line and I've got a few other things, but I'm like, oh, I'm a royal, I'm
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:15.780]  an American.
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:16.780]  I mean, I'm not upset with it, I don't have a problem with it.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:21.940]  I'm kind of more proud of some of the other genetic lines, just some interesting things,
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.540]  we'll leave it at that, but I'm proud of my Native American heritage, you know, if you
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:29.020]  got a, we're going to be an Native American being Comanche, he's not the worst thing,
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:38.060]  the most badass group there is, but the point is, is that this lady is show damn white that
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:43.540]  the analysis actually came up negative and said, this is a saltine cracker, we've, the
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:49.700]  queen of England isn't as white as this lady, you know, 120,000s, 1,000, 2,000s, whatever,
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:54.100]  I mean, this woman doesn't have one half drop of Native American and then she declared
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.380]  that her proof of Native American.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:01.980]  We all know the importance of fish oils, while we are sure to provide them for ourselves,

[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:38.060]  2030 Agenda, they want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs,
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:43.020]  they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.020]  to control everyone.

[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:31.460]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy

[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:16.740]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:34.420]  It's amazing how much pence life's that hot blonde, it's amazing how you can speak right
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.420]  to my heart.
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:51.980]  All right, this is the last segment I'm going to do live.
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:57.700]  I take the very powerful message about this poor little black girl that was murdered a
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:04.340]  week ago today in Houston and then the leftist media picked it up and made it a white supremacist
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:09.820]  narrative and then when it turned out it wasn't true, they covered it up.
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:13.860]  So that's coming up next segment.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:17.220]  This Elizabeth Warren thing just got worse than I even thought because we're doing analysis
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:22.860]  of it, blown up and into jail and believe me, it's going to seem petty when you renounce
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:27.700]  tomorrow until you pull back and go, wait, it shows how fake she is.
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:32.260]  And this is the kind of thing like Picklegate that is going to blow up in her face big time.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:38.620]  So and by the way, that's in the news everywhere she goes in Iowa, they're like, what about
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:43.380]  how you say you're Native American and the average American has 500 times the amount
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.380]  you have.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:47.020]  I mean, she's so damn white.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.020]  Let me explain.
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:53.540]  Asians invaded Europe over and over again, they came over the land bridge to America.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:56.660]  Almost everyone in Europe has quote, Native American.
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:00.660]  They have to ask you if they have American or Asian background, they just call it either
[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:05.380]  or it's the same thing.
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:10.060]  And they just play on the ignorance.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.060]  It's insane.
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:17.060]  It just shows what a fraud she is, but tomorrow, big news, weekday program, you're going to
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:24.660]  want to see this now illustrating how they just made up that somebody was saying that
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:30.660]  Congresswoman Alexander Cortez was dancing and everybody finds it upsetting.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:31.660]  No.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.660]  Actually, it's enduring her earlier video before she looked like a method, pretty good
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:44.700]  looking piece of congressional operator before she turned into what looks like a Seahawk
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:45.940]  method.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:49.860]  But I digress.
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:53.780]  No one knows, no one says who made up this thing that dancing is banned by Republicans.
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:23:00.220]  It just sounds like some weird fever dream by some 90 year old David Rockefeller, but
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:06.060]  Fox News, GOP Scalise shuts down Twitter debate on taxes with Cortez after radical followers
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:11.900]  allude to Virginia shooting and say we need more snipers to take you out.
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:16.340]  So they're the ones everywhere constantly pushing that.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:20.900]  Now let's move on to this inmates, eat NBC news holiday.
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:26.580]  Inmates did not eat NBC news, NBC news reports, inmates eat holiday steak during shutdown while
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:32.700]  prison guards go unpaid, which is a good point to add here.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:36.180]  We don't want the EBT cards to not get their money fulfilled next month.
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:42.660]  We don't want, but like old people, people I know, the IRS claims UO taxes, they take
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:46.540]  people's houses, they have heart attacks, they die.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:51.940]  Americans get targeted by IRS auditors under Obama and MSNBC and CNN go good, you deserve
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.740]  it.
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:58.980]  So they try to humanize all this when they're the ones targeting everybody.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:03.060]  When they're the ones involved in all this political stuff, here's more.
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:06.780]  Millions could face severe cuts to food stamps due to government shutdown.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.980]  What would you do if the government collapsed like Venezuela?
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:14.260]  You'd eat your dogs and then you'd starve to death over a thousand die a week in Venezuela.
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:18.620]  But they don't, but the government doesn't let you say they die of starvation and they're
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:23.860]  all trying to come up here and if we don't give them free stuff, it's our fault.
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:27.580]  Airport security screening, calling in sick and then government shutdown.
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:31.340]  Well, thank God you leave the border open, you bring in the radicals, you're hotting,
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:34.820]  so then you say all of us got to go through naked body standards and put up all this crap
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:38.020]  when you know it's nothing but a federal power grab over transportation.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.180]  I don't hate the average TSA person.
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:44.460]  It's time for Congress to reverse all this and start the profiling.
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:48.580]  Hell, they profile conservatives and ban us all over everything if we're not anti-American.
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:53.620]  Why the hell can't you profile foreigners and say they want to kill people?
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:59.700]  And then we move on to this.
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:06.660]  It's not just the prisoners eating T-bone steaks while the jail guards don't get paid.
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:07.660]  Daily Mail.
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:14.500]  Castro's model grandson, oh, they're all models, shows wealth through European vacations on
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:22.100]  million dollar yachts and jets and airplanes and big palatial palaces and all his bimbos.
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:26.020]  People are like, wait, Fidel Castro, he just, you know, he, he, he didn't even eat.
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.020]  He just breathed air.
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:30.140]  He just, no, Cuba's collapsing.
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.700]  He killed over a million people.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.700]  He's a monster.
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.700]  They all take their money to Spain and Switzerland.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:39.620]  That's what the globalists do, whether they're leftist here, like Bernie Sanders, who has
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:44.740]  three one million dollar houses and rise 115,000 dollar outties.
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:49.820]  He made his money, swindling colleges and stealing people's bank accounts.
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:53.460]  These are hardcore criminals.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.820]  And they mean business.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:26:02.180]  White people do not know what it's like to be poor.
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:09.420]  These are, he did his honeymoon in the seventies in the Soviet Union where you go piss on Christians.
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:15.300]  He's a monster creature who, when Hillary stole the nomination for him, he stood down.
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:20.140]  Walmart is worth 142 billion.
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.820]  We need to take that money.
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:25.700]  Oh, the Walmart folks did the Chinese slave goods and sold America out.
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:28.220]  Big Made America flags, nothing's Made America.
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:31.180]  They got their own problems, but what about the Goldman Sachs and trillions?
[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.180]  What about the big banks?
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.860]  What about the solid of our energy?
[01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:34.860]  That's the cause.
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:38.660]  And you sit there and don't say a damn word about that.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.180]  I want to help the workers.
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:46.180]  If you let me take over like the Bolsheviks, you will all get a chicken in every pot.
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:48.180]  All ice.
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:49.180]  All fraud.
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:50.180]  All garbage.
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:53.540]  But the good news is, they thought they'd censor me.
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:54.820]  They thought they'd block.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:55.980]  They can't do anything.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:27:00.420]  They're only tanking Facebook and Twitter and Google by trying to block with keywords
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:05.780]  every conservative, every Christian, every nationalist, every libertarian while they go
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:11.380]  before Congress and say, nobody's being censored and it should joke.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:13.220]  I'm on hundreds of radio stations.
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:14.820]  I'm on hundreds of TV stations.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:15.820]  We have info wars.com.
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:16.820]  We have newswords.com.
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:22.700]  We have the best amazing activist audience of warriors of every race, color and creed
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:28.940]  who bleed red blood and who love justice in the unborn and God and understand America's
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:32.820]  not perfect, but damn it, it's under attack because it has certain ideas that threaten
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:37.580]  these elites and they're thinking their local radio stations were picking us up.
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.380]  They're becoming sponsors locally.
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:40.940]  They are spreading the word.
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.220]  They're telling their email group.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:47.300]  They're hand texting to neighbors and friends and family about stories on info wars.com.
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:52.980]  They're getting the word out and they are unstoppable because they understand that.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:57.100]  The globalists thought they'd spend this web, this whole hoax, this whole curse, this
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:01.900]  whole spell that everybody hates us and we're faking, Jones is done and he's over and I'd
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:05.500]  go, oh my God, I'm over, see you didn't said so.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:06.580]  I'm not over.
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:12.940]  I have only stepped in the last year into true spiritual dominion.
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:17.980]  I have never traveled in waters like this in my mind and my soul and politically.
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:25.060]  I'm actually fear God more than ever because you enter this level of strength and vision
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:30.380]  and it's very humbling.
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:34.340]  So let's just be a thousand percent clear to infinity.
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:38.980]  I'm on my knees on the altar of God, whatever God's will is, I'll follow.
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:43.260]  Now key intel on the globalists trying to start a race war straight ahead, spread the
[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:48.500]  link, email it, Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and give it to everybody you know, infowars.com
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:53.700]  forward slash show, the most banned broadcast in the world refuses to die and thanks to
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:57.580]  you, we are winning together.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:00.900]  Defeat the globalist, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:04.460]  Defeat the pedophiles, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:09.420]  Defeat Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:12.980]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:17.060]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:21.700]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:26.460]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now and if
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:32.020]  all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:35.940]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:41.820]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:45.380]  Call and talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud in public.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:52.380]  hashtag Alex Jones, that's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:58.380]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:02.620]  Please, whatever you do realize, they were all getting punched, drunk to the censorship
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:06.780]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars, yes, some of them
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:10.220]  were like little side accounts, they even know we had like InfoWars stored that just
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:14.660]  showed our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I'd
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:18.180]  be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:21.740]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:23.260]  and the world back from the brick.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:27.940]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:29.420]  pesky in the future.
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:32.500]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.500]  I want to keep going.
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:37.460]  I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially.
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:39.460]  I want to push all the way.
[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:40.740]  I've committed to do that.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:44.340]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've got a
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:46.340]  back ish and I promise you this.
[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.700]  I will never falter.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:50.060]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:55.140]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at foreshore.com
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:31:03.220]  to give you my absolute total commitment.

[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:59.740]  Get the real red pill plus at info wars stores.com info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:03.100]  in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:08.260]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:15.100]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:20.940]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:24.260]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:29.220]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:34.260]  of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.260]  symptoms.
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:39.140]  If pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:43.860]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:49.660]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:52.380]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:33:14.540]  Get to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:35.540]  The story we're about to break down is particularly painful for anyone who has children.
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:40.900]  Like myself, I have three daughters and a son and when I think about someone for absolutely
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:48.500]  no reason killing them with a firearm, a knife, an automobile, with poison, for absolutely
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:52.500]  no reason, it makes my blood boil.
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:57.420]  Well there was a little seven year old black girl named Jasmine Barnes in Houston whose
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:05.500]  grandmother was over visiting and they wanted to go to the store and get some eggs and biscuits
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:13.620]  and some horrible person or group of people fired bullets into the car injuring her sister
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:16.780]  and mother and killing her.
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:19.700]  And so I followed it all week long.
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:25.060]  I'm a Texan, this happened, you know, close to where I live, I've been in Houston.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:30.500]  And so this morning I got up about 5 a.m. and certain stories I follow and I saw that
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:36.140]  an arrest had been made in the killing of Jasmine.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:39.540]  And I thought, wow, I mean, I was told a white supremacist had done it.
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:41.460]  Let's see who this piece of crap is.
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:47.700]  And I read the CNN whole article and it never said who the white supremacist was.
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:50.420]  In fact, it didn't say the name of the guy.
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:58.860]  So I typed Jasmine Barnes' name into Google and click news and I saw the New York Times,
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:03.660]  I saw the Washington Post, I saw CNN and I saw these articles and I went to them and
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:06.020]  I spent like 30 minutes.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:10.780]  I went and got on my desktop and I was trying to find who did it.
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:11.780]  They wouldn't say his name.
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:16.860]  And then I went, let me check local news, which was 20 pages down in the Google search.
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:24.980]  And so I go there and local ABC 13 and others reported yesterday who did it, his name, him
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:30.340]  being taken to the police station, him being indicted.
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:31.340]  And he admitted he did it.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:36.820]  I mean, it was on all the Houston news channels just two and a half hours away from me.
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:38.340]  And I went, wait a minute.
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:41.340]  So by then it was about 545, I've had a cup of coffee.
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:46.740]  I'm sitting in there at my desk drinking at my underwear and I start thinking, something's
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:50.460]  wrong here, I'm half awake.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:51.460]  What's going on?
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:57.140]  I spent 30 minutes trying to find out the name of the guy.
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:59.180]  Why didn't they tell me?
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:06.380]  And of course, once I go to the local news, it's on every Houston TV channel a day before
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.940]  him being brought on the police station, him being brought in to be indicted.
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.940]  They didn't waste time on this.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:17.580]  The judge was there on Saturday and I went, oh my God, this is one of the best examples
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:22.300]  of fake news and the whole national media working in concert.
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:27.340]  All the local news got it right, that after a week of them thinking that an evil white
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:32.500]  supremacist, because the national news had said that, had killed this little girl and
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:38.420]  wounded her mom and sister, that it was a black guy who came in and admitted that he
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:45.180]  had done it basically with others, part of a mistaken identity and it just, it was incredible
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:51.540]  because to watch the national media work in concert to keep everybody in the dark was
[01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:58.140]  just insane and they did it because of this, 90 plus percent of blacks that are killed
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:04.420]  in this country are killed by other blacks in Chicago, it's over 95% and whenever a poor
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:08.420]  black person gets killed by another black person, it hardly makes the news.
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.900]  But when you do have cases, rare cases, but still horrible cases of white supremacists
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:16.820]  going in churches and shooting people or things like that, the media hypes it up like it's
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:21.060]  the end of the world to create racial and cultural division.
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:23.540]  And so that's why this had been done.
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:29.580]  And so Sheila Jackson Lee and CNN and the new Black Panther Party and all the media for
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:35.220]  a week had gone with one of the composites of people they saw at the convenience store.
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:40.860]  Yeah, they saw this white guy with a hoodie, they saw other people, but the media ran with
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:45.860]  that narrative and then pick that up and we had the headlines all week long.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:51.140]  Here's a time magazine headline, fatal shooting of seven year old black girl outside Walmart
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:55.220]  sparks hate crime fears in Houston.
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.660]  Here's another one.
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:38:06.180]  Why the death of seven year old black girl becomes a national story about race and violence.
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:12.300]  Thousands of these articles throughout the week and then on Saturday when ABC 13 and other
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:20.700]  channels report on what really happened and that it was a some type of drug gang and mistaken
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:24.940]  identity of this car, this poor little girl and her family were in, well, the national
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:27.060]  media can't have that.
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:33.380]  So they just hope Saturday and Sunday morning that you didn't notice.
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:38.540]  So it was just the CNN headline, okay, the man has admitted that he was involved in it
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:47.140]  and it was drug related and that it was mistaken identity and we found Jasmine's killer.
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:53.780]  But let's move on because they didn't want to admit that they had said it was race based
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:57.020]  and basically try to make every white person in America feel guilty like they were a bad
[01:38:57.020 --> 01:39:01.100]  person and make the mainstream media look like the good guys using this poor little
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:07.220]  dead girl, huge rallies with thousands of people out there basically saying we're going
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:12.500]  to find the white supremacists that did this and we're going to make sure he gets punished.
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:17.100]  You know, I wish black folks and everybody else for that matter would get upset about
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:19.940]  the millions of black people that have been aborted before they ever left the mother's
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:22.340]  womb or any other babies being killed for that matter.
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:26.940]  I wish they get excited about 90 plus percent of the black people being killed in this country
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:27.940]  are killed by other blacks.
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:32.180]  But when that happens, it's not an issue and it's not a problem in any community.
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:33.500]  I don't know why.
[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:38.420]  I don't know why then when a little black girl gets killed and some of the witnesses
[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:41.860]  think they saw a white guy in a hoodie, it becomes racially motivated.
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:43.260]  Maybe he's a crackhead.
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:45.180]  Maybe he's a crazy person.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:53.060]  Maybe he's hallucinating or maybe it's mistaken identity because statistically there's a group
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:55.260]  that kills the least amount of people in this country.
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:57.700]  It's called Asians of every group.
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:02.060]  There's nine groups on the criminal scale, the least violent, they're all Asian.
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:09.860]  Then there's one group after that whites are the next most nonviolent group.
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:15.900]  And then it goes down the line, Hispanics and then you go right down there to the bottom.
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:19.220]  It's black folks and that's the statistic you can't lie about.
[01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:21.220]  Everybody knows that.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:25.780]  Black folks kill each other more than anybody else and I want it to stop.
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:27.700]  I'm not putting that statistic out to be mean.
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:28.700]  It's just a fact.
[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:33.380]  So you've got all these black leaders that come out every time some white person kills
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:38.140]  a black person and every time it's unjustified whether it is or not.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:41.260]  And then when it looks like, okay, it's a white guy did it.
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:43.420]  Everybody runs with it and says he's a white supremacist.
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:49.940]  And then when it turns out it's a black guy and it's drug related and it's mistaken identity
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:53.660]  but people whacked out of their brain at 6.30 in the morning shooting up a car because it
[01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:57.700]  looks like somebody they don't like.
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:01.580]  The media tried to cover it up and just say, hey, they caught the guy, don't worry about
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:02.580]  it, move along.
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:11.060]  There and others noticed what I noticed and by just a few hours ago on Sunday evening
[01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:15.420]  mainstream media had to report, oh, mistaken identity, it was a drug shooting.
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:20.820]  They thought it was other drug dealers move along and now the story will end but the story
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:21.820]  isn't over.
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:27.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have big articles by Paul Joseph Watson and by Kit Daniels
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:34.300]  that are up on infowars.com that lay all of this out and show the FBI's own crime statistics,
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:42.820]  national crime statistics, you name it, proving that the most dangerous person to a black
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:48.100]  person in this country is either a Planned Parenthood employee who are a bunch of white
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:52.620]  supremacists by the way that's who set it up or other black people.
[01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:56.500]  And so if I'm doing something wrong in my life or my community's got a problem, I want
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:59.060]  to take ownership of it so I can fix it.
[01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:03.140]  And so if the black community was out there every time a black child got shot, getting
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:07.060]  upset and doing go fund me's and going after who did it, trying to clean the streets up,
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:12.020]  I'd be behind it and I'm behind supporting this young lady and her go fund me for her
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:13.020]  family and her memory.
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:14.020]  And it's a tragedy.
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.020]  She's a sweet little girl.
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:19.260]  I have a 20 month old daughter, a 10 year old daughter and a 14 year old daughter tears
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.260]  my guts out.
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:21.260]  Makes me have nightmares.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:25.020]  That's why I was following the story.
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:31.700]  But now we learn that they used her death to try to divide America, to try to turn black
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:34.460]  Americans against white Americans to believers in epidemic.
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:40.860]  You know who got quoted all over the national news was community activist Derrick Muhammad
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:46.780]  claimed that the murder proved black people are being indiscriminately targeted by racist
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:57.460]  whites.
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:01.300]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:05.820]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania States, but a lot of us on the big island
[01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:11.260]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:16.660]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:18.180]  to unhealthy levels.
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:24.700]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:28.700]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:30.180]  in the rainwater.
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:35.420]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:41.500]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:47.100]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:52.420]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:57.220]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:44:01.500]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:05.540]  Info wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:08.500]  every faucet, shower and sink in your home.

[01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:05.340]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:10.380]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:15.340]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've

[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:04.020]  Words could not describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:08.220]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:12.380]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:14.380]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:17.740]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:20.340]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.660]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:27.580]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:29.660]  why we've been made the main target.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:36.220]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, infowars.com,
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:39.940]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:40.940]  We'll win.
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:43.500]  We have huge sales at infowars.com right now.
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:47.660]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:51.220]  the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:54.900]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:56.420]  This is InfoWars Darker Sour.
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:57.420]  We do your support.
[01:46:57.420 --> 01:46:58.420]  We're proud of you.
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:04.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:19.420]  Well, sorry, sir, the statistics show it's about 5% of black people that are dead.
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:30.980]  Out of 100 are killed by white people.
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:34.100]  Black people are being targeted in this country.
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:36.220]  Black people are being targeted in this country.
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:38.240]  Black people are being targeted in the city.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:43.020]  So we are thoroughly convinced that the killing of Jasmine Barnes was race related.
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:48.060]  We believe that there is a white supremacist element in the area that needs to be trotted
[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:53.140]  out, found and brought to justice, he said.
[01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:58.620]  We heard similar things out of Sheila Jackson-Leen and we saw all these rallies and man, I wish
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:04.980]  we could see 2,500 black people or white people or anybody for that matter, show up when I
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:09.340]  go protest Planned Parenthood in South Austin and East Austin.
[01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:14.900]  We're right here in Austin, more than half the abortions they do, even though Austin
[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:18.220]  is only like 15% black, are black people.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:21.420]  So that's the ultimate litmus test.
[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:26.620]  I don't want to kill black people on the womb.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:31.980]  I do want to slap race-baiting new Black Panther Party people that are basically black
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:36.380]  KKK upside the head when they sit there and say whites are inherently devils, whites are
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:39.100]  inherently evil, whites need to be exterminated.
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.860]  That's a bunch of Hitler crap.
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:44.220]  Just because it's coming out of some black guy's mouth doesn't mean it isn't the same
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:49.660]  crap we heard out of Hitler and other people that caused all these giant wars.
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:54.580]  It's ideology of freedom and liberty and justice we need and that's what's going to save little
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:57.660]  girls like Jasmine Barnes.
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:04.220]  She wasn't just murdered by somebody clearly involved in drug operations and mistaken identity
[01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:05.380]  of that car.
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:09.780]  Now they've stolen her identity in the media and claim to white supremacist killer to try
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:14.540]  to make sure we're more divided in this nation and try to make sure the real problems of
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:18.820]  the drugs flooding these communities and this giant prison industrial complex that Trump's
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:20.020]  trying to dial back.
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:23.860]  This is all a distraction from that and it makes me angry.
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:32.340]  And I'll be honest with you, it scares me that ABC News and CBS and CNN would all be
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:37.180]  in lockstep when you've got a national story, one of the top stories, who's the white supremacist
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:43.740]  killed a little black girl and they got such a news blackout, no pun intended, on this whole
[01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:49.700]  deal that I lived two and a half hours from Houston, it wasn't on the news here, we didn't
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:54.300]  hear about it yesterday, I had to see national news this morning and notice that they didn't
[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:57.780]  say who his name was and I'm like wait, did they arrest somebody, they mugshot him, they
[01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:02.940]  indict him, now later CNN went in and added the names and changed the headlines and did
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:03.940]  all that.
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:09.140]  By the time I got down here this afternoon for the show, it all been changed, but that
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:13.100]  just shows how they'll do anything they can get away with and that's why they don't want
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:17.260]  in FullWars.com, that's why they don't want NewsWars.com, that's why they don't want things
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:21.140]  like DrugsReport.com, that's why they don't want Daily Caller, they don't want anything
[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:25.580]  out there that's going to be watching and challenging their narrative.
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:29.660]  If the killer of this little girl turned out to be some dirtbag white supremacist, I would
[01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:35.540]  come out and decry it and say it was wrong and point out what had happened, but instead
[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:39.180]  the corporate media just wanted to say it was a white person to create division and
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:44.300]  then once it turned out it wasn't, they didn't correct it until the public forced them to
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:51.220]  and that's the good news is the people are aware of what's going on, it's crazy.
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:54.540]  You know if it had been a white supremacist or a white guy period that killed her, it
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:51:00.020]  could have been just a crackhead, drughead, mistake had any of another drug dealer, whatever,
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:05.020]  because most crimes are related, you know it'd be that white face up there and everything
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:08.780]  about him or what he said on social media and any social media he posted on would be
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:15.740]  in big trouble, but because it's a black man that did it, killing another black person,
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:19.500]  even still most of the reportage they just updated it at the bottom and didn't tell
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:22.700]  the public anything.
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:29.740]  It's so sad to see this, so in summation this is a tragedy that very evil forces have seized
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:34.580]  upon to create more division in America and distract from the real problems in these communities
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:36.220]  that I want to see healed.
[01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:41.980]  Here's a USAA article, mistake I did, a shooting murder charge filed in death of Jasmine Barnes
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:47.820]  7 in Houston and then again you have to dig deep in this until you ever find out it's
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:53.860]  a black guy that did it and they don't even show you an image, but if it was a white person
[01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:58.380]  they would show you the image to rub it in and make it racial and to make it as if we're
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:02.660]  all in a war with each other, that's in the WikiLeaks where Hillary is telling her operatives
[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:07.200]  I want racial division in America, I want class warfare, this is what the Democratic
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:14.580]  Party does and I'm tired of it, it's disgusting, but again the good news is the public was
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:20.900]  here, they were watching and after a day the media was at least forced to admit okay the
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:25.580]  guy on the sketch isn't who did it, but then almost all the stories won't show you who
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:30.820]  did do it because they want to make it racial and have that in the back of your mind, it's
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:31.820]  incredible.
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:36.220]  You know when info wars makes mistakes we'll correct it and the news always goes, Jones
[01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:41.540]  admits he's fake and lied, no when I make a mistake and we correct, which is rare, we
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:46.740]  tell you and then the mainstream media that lies, they tell more lies and say that we
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:53.100]  say that we've lied, these people are factories of deception and evil, they are the establishment,
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:56.460]  they're mad that Trump's pulling troops out of war zones, something Obama promised to
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:53:00.780]  do never did, they're mad he's doing criminal justice reform so black people don't get
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:08.260]  triple the sentences for drugs that whites and others get, that's everything black activist
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:14.020]  groups ever called for, but almost no coverage of it, because ladies and gentlemen the democratic
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:19.420]  party in the global is trying to keep black people on the plantation, that's it for this
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:24.700]  special transmission, I'll be back live here in just a few minutes, four to six p.m. central
[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:28.620]  with the normal Sunday transmission, but I wanted to come in specifically and talk about
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:33.580]  this, hold on, hold on, let's not end this yet, one last point, the most important point
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:37.100]  here in my notes, no matter if you're black, no matter if you're white, no matter if you're
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:42.580]  Hispanic or Asian, older young, this is sweet family and they're in a lot of pain right
[01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:47.420]  now and they've been used in abuse, so I'm glad there's a GoFundMe account and I'm glad
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:51.380]  people are donating to help her family and help her memory and help take care of these
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:57.460]  good people, so I'm asking all the listeners to go to the GoFundMe for Jasmine Barnes and
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:54:02.860]  to make a donation today and to make a donation to the victims of crime in general and to
[01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:09.660]  the fallen police officer funds in your area as well. God bless the memory and the soul
[01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:14.460]  of Jasmine and police supporter folks, they're getting a lot more than $79,000 to recover
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:18.220]  from this, thank you.
[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:23.780]  You know that guy, Alex Jones, the Info Wars guy, you know what I'm talking about? The
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:30.260]  guy with no lips, that fucking lunatic, they removed all his content from Facebook, iTunes,
[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:35.620]  Pinterest and YouTube, good you fuck. You know the piece of shit I'm talking about, right?
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:40.460]  Alex Jones, you know what piece of shit I'm talking about? Alex fucking Jones, you know
[01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:46.180]  right? They shut you down, you fuck you, good, no freedom of speech for you, you piece of
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:51.460]  shit, good you fucking lunatic, good, bye bye, fuck off.
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:56.460]  Tech companies are taking the lead and suppressing any voices that dissent against the left.
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:55:00.380]  Conservatives are feeling the heavy hand of censorship in the United States and across
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:01.460]  Western Europe.
[01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:06.860]  There is an absolute all out war on conservative free speech.
[01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:14.740]  Facebook and Twitter under fire as conservative users are speaking out about being censored
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:15.740]  on their platforms.
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:18.820]  Alex Jones is banned by every major social network.
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:23.740]  In the past few days, Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Spotify and other companies have all banned
[01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:25.660]  Alex Jones from using their platforms.
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:27.900]  He's been shadow banned by Google.
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:30.100]  Milo Unopolis was banned by Twitter.
[01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:34.140]  I don't know if you know about this, but Milo Unopolis, you know he is, he got banned
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:37.180]  from Twitter for writing a bad review about Ghostbusters.
[01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:38.900]  This guy is a threat to the Republic.
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:43.860]  British anti-Islamization activist Tommy Robinson has had his Twitter account suspended
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:47.540]  again after he tweeted that Islam promotes killing.
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:52.700]  Also, Twitter purged various libertarian accounts, Instagram temporarily banned Tommy
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:57.900]  Robinson, Facebook took down a GOP candidate's ads for allegedly being offensive.
[01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:01.980]  The FCC is cracking down on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:03.940]  They're coming for everyone's speech.
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:04.940]  It's criminal.
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:10.220]  Their social media accounts are being banned, blocked and canceled on Twitter, YouTube and
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:11.220]  Facebook.
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:13.300]  Facebook's censored our free speech.
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:17.700]  Twitter this evening has suspended the account of Gavin McGuinness.
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:22.580]  And same on the ones that don't even see that we have been censored.
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:26.300]  We're caught on tape by Project Veritas, shadow banning people.
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:27.300]  You are censoring people.
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:28.300]  You censor me.
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:29.300]  You censor Milo.
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:30.300]  You censor Chuck Johnson.
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:31.300]  James O'Keefe.
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:35.100]  You even censored President Trump when one of your employees deleted his account for
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:36.100]  a few minutes.
[01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:37.100]  You are censoring conservatives.
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:40.140]  And I'm asking you, President Donald Trump, help us.
[01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:43.180]  Please help us, Mr. President, before it is too late.
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:44.940]  Facebook is censoring free speech.
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:46.540]  They're making and changing the rules.
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:48.980]  Reverend Graham was banned for over 24 hours.
[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:53.260]  I had this platform, and that was my main platform for communicating with people and
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:55.340]  sending out my contents, and now I can't communicate.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:56.340]  I've been silenced.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:59.900]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning
[01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:03.820]  people, that are outright banning people, and that are blocking conservatives.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:08.220]  Authorities in Britain now seem more interested in fighting hate speech on the Internet than
[01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:09.780]  fighting crime.
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:13.940]  They're warning social media users that their comments are being monitored.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:18.500]  I'm more upset that some people in Silicon Valley are secret.
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:22.660]  I don't know which ideas are allowed on my social media feed.
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:27.100]  So we just sit here and just endure the greatest censorship in the history of America, and
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:31.860]  the left, which claims to be for free speech, applauds it.
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:34.660]  No freedom of speech for you, you piece of shit.
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:47.180]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:50.780]  Defeat the globalist, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:54.340]  Defeat the pedophiles, hashtag Alex Jones.

[01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:02.860]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:06.980]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:11.580]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:16.340]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and
[01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:21.900]  if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:25.820]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:31.740]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:36.460]  Call and talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:39.940]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:48.500]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:52.340]  Our grandparents and great grandparents knew that they can food during the falls they'd
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:58.900]  have it during the winter, and that's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com with M4 Select.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:04.540]  It's the full spectrum of my patriot supply on the top, most respected companies out there,
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:10.180]  but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their
[01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:12.260]  other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:16.540]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:17.540]  win-win.
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:23.420]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4sTour.com, on M4 Select, storeable foods,
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:27.620]  they've got special diet foods, they've got three month supplies, your supplies, weak
[01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:30.740]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there.
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:34.620]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply, if stuff happens you can feed your whole block.
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:37.220]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:42.100]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:51.460]  M4sTour.com and M4 Select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriot supply.
