[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:19.000]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.000 --> 00:31.200]  Texas Alex Jones we are learning more on this Thursday edition 22nd day of
[00:31.200 --> 00:37.000]  January 2009 about the Obama administration's agenda and it's exactly
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  what they said it would be now they said one thing publicly and that they hyped
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.520]  that was vague and nebulous about helping everyone in soup kitchens and
[00:48.520 --> 00:54.160]  getting America back on the right track but in Obama's actions and lobbying for
[00:54.160 --> 01:04.040]  the Wall Street coup fully taking over the United States and in the previous
[01:04.040 --> 01:07.880]  voting record of Barack Obama and in the individuals he's picking for his
[01:07.880 --> 01:13.120]  administration and the fine print announcements he's made on his agenda
[01:13.120 --> 01:17.880]  it is very very bad but some said well let's just wait and see what he does
[01:17.880 --> 01:24.440]  once he gets into office well two days into office less than two full days into
[01:24.440 --> 01:30.520]  being sworn in it'll be two days in about an hour we are now getting a very
[01:30.520 --> 01:37.320]  clear picture they've suddenly changed the way White House dot gov looks to mirror
[01:37.320 --> 01:46.760]  Obama's Obama's change dot gov and USA service dot org why is that important
[01:46.760 --> 01:53.000]  well they're they're mixing and blurring the lines between his private army and
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.120]  his governmental position so the sites all have the exact same look basically and
[01:59.120 --> 02:07.760]  he's creating a private pool of volunteers with the uniform basically of
[02:07.760 --> 02:13.640]  government on them to merge with the government itself Timothy Gethner the
[02:13.640 --> 02:20.680]  soon-to-be appointed Treasury Secretary is supposedly going to be giving some
[02:20.680 --> 02:26.000]  details of the new economic plan but it's the same economic plan that we saw
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.240]  under Bush and Obama in the last four months total secrecy they're saying
[02:30.240 --> 02:33.880]  they're not going to let you know where the trillions of dollars are going and
[02:33.880 --> 02:39.360]  won't let you know where the previous trillions are going and up on White
[02:39.360 --> 02:43.000]  House dot gov I spent quite a bit of time last night and this morning reading
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.120]  the subsections on the environment it's an 80% carbon reduction as he promised
[02:48.120 --> 02:56.360]  listing carbon dioxide is a toxic waste and bringing in a cap and trade tax so
[02:56.360 --> 03:00.640]  when we had Rothschild on the show and he said no there's no plan with global
[03:00.640 --> 03:04.880]  warming for a tax and laughed at me laughed at the audience and when all of
[03:04.880 --> 03:08.320]  these people say oh no global warming isn't about a tax they're now openly
[03:08.320 --> 03:12.800]  in on the White House website saying it's a tax case of the denial is
[03:12.800 --> 03:16.800]  completely over though it will continue I know while we're paying taxes the
[03:16.800 --> 03:21.240]  carbon taxes if we don't beat this people will say it's not a tax this is the
[03:21.240 --> 03:27.000]  double-think mass mind control mass lunacy mass ignorant system we're
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.440]  living under so that is coming up we have Bob Chapman on in the second hour
[03:33.440 --> 03:40.280]  and Joe Rogan who has been on the show quite a few times over the years over
[03:40.280 --> 03:45.360]  the phone because we became friends I guess about nine years ago just by
[03:45.360 --> 03:49.200]  action because he was friends with Kevin Booth and I found out he was you know
[03:49.200 --> 03:54.680]  into quote conspiracies and things in New World Order a few weeks ago I talked
[03:54.680 --> 03:57.080]  to Joe and he said he was coming to Austin he ought to come in studio and
[03:57.080 --> 04:02.480]  I talked to him last week and then he called the other day and said yeah I'll
[04:02.480 --> 04:08.040]  come in on Thursday and then we haven't really locked down exactly when he's
[04:08.040 --> 04:11.720]  coming in and I kind of forgot about it until this morning and I'm calling his
[04:11.720 --> 04:15.400]  cell phone and he's not answering it's but Joe Rogan should be in studio I
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.400]  should give him the new address of where we're located so Joe coming up in the

[08:32.680 --> 08:39.600]  strengthen banks as they are able to lend treasure secretary designate Tim
[08:39.600 --> 08:45.840]  gethner said on Wednesday testifying to the Senate committee considering his
[08:45.840 --> 08:50.400]  nomination mr. gethner said the Obama team was working on a comprehensive plan
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.320]  to deal with the banks and hope to unveil it soon and what they're going to
[08:55.320 --> 08:59.760]  do is they're gonna bring this forward the next two weeks he's saying and then
[08:59.760 --> 09:04.840]  when Congress says how much money is it you'll just say it's a blank check they'll
[09:04.840 --> 09:09.480]  tell the public a number like 700 billion again they're on record I have the
[09:09.480 --> 09:14.680]  congressional testimony it's coming up the new Obama film where they say it's
[09:14.680 --> 09:21.880]  just a made-up number it's unlimited and it's been six weeks now and six weeks
[09:21.880 --> 09:26.200]  ago in just two months it was 8.5 trillion they'd stolen and won't tell
[09:26.200 --> 09:28.840]  anyone where it went and then now they're just keeping those numbers
[09:28.840 --> 09:33.320]  completely secret for all we know it may be more than 1.3 trillion a week
[09:33.320 --> 09:37.000]  they're stealing that's what they were doing before now it's all completely
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.160]  secret nothing is coming out no one knows anything in Congress and they have
[09:43.160 --> 09:48.520]  told in federal lawsuits against the Treasury Department and the private
[09:48.520 --> 09:54.240]  fellow reserve they're on record saying that the legislation gave them the power
[09:54.240 --> 09:58.720]  to tell no one where it went and that no court or legislature in the land can
[09:58.720 --> 10:04.720]  even investigate or review now that was the subsection in the bill and we read
[10:04.720 --> 10:11.280]  it over and over and over and over and over and over again on the air week
[10:11.280 --> 10:16.080]  after week when they were trying to ram it through terrorizing the public saying
[10:16.080 --> 10:19.360]  we'd have a depression if they didn't that day one they were going to unfreeze
[10:19.360 --> 10:22.960]  the subprime mortgages that that was quote the threat and then it passed
[10:22.960 --> 10:28.560]  October 3rd October 4th on the Saturday Treasury Secretary Halson Fed chairman
[10:28.560 --> 10:31.400]  Bernanke came out and said well we're actually not going to use any of the
[10:31.400 --> 10:35.000]  money for that now it's not a problem now that isn't what caused all this well
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.120]  that was actually true and we told everybody that and so now they're
[10:39.120 --> 10:43.040]  coming in again saying we need even more power and they're going to say there's
[10:43.040 --> 10:47.240]  going to be a depression if you don't do this it'll be the same trick they
[10:47.240 --> 10:55.240]  played in late September early October for two weeks saying depression
[10:55.240 --> 10:58.560]  depression depression and that destroying confidence the markets
[10:58.560 --> 11:01.400]  plunging so they could go in and buy it up and we know what they've done with
[11:01.400 --> 11:04.120]  the money they've bought gold and they bought up key stocks that they know
[11:04.120 --> 11:06.640]  they're not going to completely destroy in the future and they bought up
[11:06.640 --> 11:09.920]  infrastructure because it's come out here in there and the private fellow
[11:09.920 --> 11:15.200]  reserve is quietly to institutions and governments issuing its own bonds now
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.960]  before the Treasury issued him and then interest on the bonds was paid to the
[11:20.960 --> 11:28.000]  banks so it is just you think the looting has been bad so far you ain't
[11:28.000 --> 11:35.920]  seen nothing yet and the levels are so catastrophic so Leviathan so gargantuan
[11:35.920 --> 11:45.520]  so colossal so humongous in their scale that it's already irrevocable financial
[11:45.520 --> 11:48.840]  destruction of not just the United States but the world for the general
[11:48.840 --> 11:54.160]  public and countries not for the elite this is the final round of risk global
[11:54.160 --> 11:58.300]  domination as they financially dominate the nations they can militarily the
[11:58.300 --> 12:05.360]  nations that resist them now it's all been done through fraud you know if
[12:05.360 --> 12:08.440]  somebody tricks you into signing a fraudulent contract handing over
[12:08.440 --> 12:12.440]  everything you own and then making you a sharecropper slave for life you can
[12:12.440 --> 12:18.440]  just say it's a fraudulent contract break it not go along with it you know for
[12:18.440 --> 12:21.120]  contracts to stand up in court they have to have consideration they have to be
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.080]  somewhat fair well this is a fraud these are the people that engineered the
[12:25.080 --> 12:31.640]  economic crisis sees sees the executive through north com and other systems of
[12:31.640 --> 12:36.680]  Homeland Security terrorize the public and Congress into going along with
[12:36.680 --> 12:41.880]  something that was 98% unpopular in every major poll somewhere 99% they
[12:41.880 --> 12:49.320]  were getting thousand to one phone calls in Congress that's on record and so
[12:49.320 --> 12:57.080]  what's happening they're now bringing us into round two and Congress the clips
[12:57.080 --> 13:01.000]  are up on YouTube yesterday said well we'll tell us what you'll do with them
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.960]  with with the new plan and tell us what your new plan is going to be and he said
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.200]  I can't tell you I'm just going to need you to pass the bill when we give it to
[13:09.200 --> 13:13.480]  you in two weeks I mean if they've already got almost complete omnipotent
[13:13.480 --> 13:19.560]  power unlimited or what will the new thing be well they're the key here is
[13:19.560 --> 13:23.920]  a gethner saying this is going to be internationally coordinated and that
[13:23.920 --> 13:26.960]  will be the Congress signing over Federal Reserve Banking Authority with a
[13:26.960 --> 13:32.800]  new 1913 style Federal Reserve Accord just like under the World Trade
[13:32.800 --> 13:38.080]  Organization in 96 95 96 in different accords the Congress handed over most
[13:38.080 --> 13:43.760]  of its trade authority to an unelected private international board through a
[13:43.760 --> 13:50.080]  treaty it will be a treaty with the private consortium the banking cartel
[13:50.080 --> 13:55.400]  the globalist out of London and out of Europe and because they've announced
[13:55.400 --> 13:58.280]  this what it's going to be you know Congress is well what's the plan going
[13:58.280 --> 14:01.440]  to be well what are you proposing well it's international in scope but I can't
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.320]  tell you but they already did tell us in the times of London and in the Wall
[14:05.320 --> 14:09.840]  Street Journal and in Newsweek with headlines like New World Bank to run
[14:09.840 --> 14:16.280]  world currencies and other financial institutions acting as world government so
[14:16.280 --> 14:21.680]  we know what it is so let me tell you what's going to be proposed
[14:21.680 --> 14:28.400]  but first let me digress while the bill they passed on October 3rd giving
[14:28.400 --> 14:33.200]  them dictatorial complete power with no oversight and immunity said one thing
[14:33.200 --> 14:37.680]  publicly they said it's only 700 billion it's total transparency everything
[14:37.680 --> 14:41.120]  will be public everything will be reviewed everything will be available
[14:41.120 --> 14:45.080]  Congress is in control of this the Treasury Secretary is in control of
[14:45.080 --> 14:51.080]  this meanwhile the bill said 180 degrees the opposite of that well this can be
[14:51.080 --> 14:55.400]  the same thing here total transparency total the public will be made abreast
[14:55.400 --> 15:00.360]  none of this will go to CEO bonuses none of this will go to broker bonuses none
[15:00.360 --> 15:03.800]  of this will go to shareholders the government's going to get a stake in
[15:03.800 --> 15:10.240]  this blah blah blah do it or we're gonna have a depression and if Congress
[15:10.240 --> 15:14.360]  bolts again and says but where's the other money what you do they'll go okay
[15:14.360 --> 15:20.040]  the market just went down 3,000 points and they'll go okay okay okay we'll sign
[15:20.040 --> 15:24.040]  a new Federal Reserve but a global Federal Reserve Act agreeing for
[15:24.040 --> 15:28.080]  Congress to fully not just hand over the power to the Treasury Secretary and the
[15:28.080 --> 15:32.320]  private Fed boss but we'll hand the power over to the complete European
[15:32.320 --> 15:37.280]  shareholders and that's why you have current and former Fed board members in
[15:37.280 --> 15:41.480]  Bloomberg saying we've asked what's going on and we've been told you will not be
[15:41.480 --> 15:46.600]  told war powers has been enacted and only the Fed governors in New York know
[15:46.600 --> 15:51.280]  what's happening but then if you reverse engineer it look at what they've been
[15:51.280 --> 15:54.480]  proposing getting everybody ready for it you know what's going on behind the
[15:54.480 --> 15:59.720]  scenes you understand the magnitude they are going to bring the private
[15:59.720 --> 16:05.160]  Federal Reserve system with its already foreign shareholders publicly into the
[16:05.160 --> 16:14.480]  open-world government banking taxation system and I read Lou Rockwell I read
[16:14.480 --> 16:18.440]  all the other Patriot and libertarian sites and I'm sorry none of them even
[16:18.440 --> 16:24.240]  get it Ron Paul gets it and he'll get on air and say yeah they're probably going
[16:24.240 --> 16:27.080]  to try to move to that and I'm like thinking Congressman have you read
[16:27.080 --> 16:30.320]  Newsweek have you read Financial Times I mean have you read all the news they're
[16:30.320 --> 16:36.160]  saying yet there's I mean they said they would use the Patriot Act on Americans
[16:36.160 --> 16:41.520]  for misdemeanors in non-terror related and and I had lost scholars and people
[16:41.520 --> 16:44.640]  laugh at me for two years and finally apologize and say oh I guess it does say
[16:44.640 --> 16:47.640]  that and now they're charging tens of thousands a month with it all over the
[16:47.640 --> 16:51.600]  country at the federal and state level I mean I'm not that smart and I'm
[16:51.600 --> 16:56.280]  frankly I don't understand why I'm the only one that it seems sees this
[16:56.280 --> 17:02.320]  absolutely clearly other than maybe Professor Michelle Chassadowski he is
[17:02.320 --> 17:08.080]  the only other person and I know Ron Paul knows it but he doesn't like to come
[17:08.080 --> 17:10.440]  all the way out with it because he knows the media can spend that against him
[17:10.440 --> 17:15.920]  but the time for mincing words and holding back is over I was up here at
[17:15.920 --> 17:22.080]  midnight last night and saw a clip on Yahoo News I think we sent it to the
[17:22.080 --> 17:25.440]  webmasters they're posting it on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com will play
[17:25.440 --> 17:31.040]  later we have time of Glenn Beck of all people with Ron Paul yesterday saying
[17:31.040 --> 17:36.720]  world governments taking over through the banks both parties are controlled this
[17:36.720 --> 17:40.280]  is a world government and then he read a founding father quote about
[17:40.280 --> 17:45.840]  banks being more dangerous than standing armies that would overthrow America it
[17:45.840 --> 17:50.360]  was like Alex Jones it suddenly possessed Glenn Beck on Fox News and then
[17:50.360 --> 17:54.800]  Ron Paul came in and agreed so I don't even know what that means I guess the
[17:54.800 --> 17:58.360]  establishment thinks Fox News is so discredited with the public that if Fox
[17:58.360 --> 18:03.280]  News comes out and talks like Alex Jones that somehow it so I so in a way this
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.480]  is starting to come out but no one is talking or discussing the fact that they
[18:07.480 --> 18:12.640]  are about to publicly I mean the mainstream news is admitting they're
[18:12.640 --> 18:17.320]  doing it but then our own movement that's been right all along cannot come to
[18:17.320 --> 18:23.120]  grips with the fact that it's actually happening now it's here it's here in the
[18:23.120 --> 18:27.800]  next two three weeks it's here ladies and gentlemen and I just couldn't believe
[18:27.800 --> 18:31.800]  it I couldn't believe that that Glenn Beck was on this remember Glenn Beck was
[18:31.800 --> 18:35.320]  saying Ron Paul supporters are dangerous the army needs to be used against them
[18:35.320 --> 18:40.560]  their their their domestic enemies I put a clip of that in Truth Rising see back
[18:40.560 --> 18:44.040]  when Ron Paul could have actually won and was and was exploding like a
[18:44.040 --> 18:48.600]  grass fire the establishment shot him down attacking now the establishment
[18:48.600 --> 18:51.440]  thinks it's too late that they're getting what they want they're already
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.400]  bringing us into the depression they don't care now some US media is being
[18:56.400 --> 18:59.720]  forced to report the truth because they would lose their whole audience if they
[18:59.720 --> 19:03.040]  didn't and their CEOs and people I guarantee you have told them hey it
[19:03.040 --> 19:06.360]  doesn't matter the truth's out anyways go ahead and report it the people can't
[19:06.360 --> 19:11.600]  stop us now I mean Glenn Beck is a Benedict Arnold if he comes out and
[19:11.600 --> 19:15.600]  apologizes and says I was an agent or I was reading talking points and I made a
[19:15.600 --> 19:20.120]  mistake and I apologize and I henceforth swear to fight the New World Order and
[19:20.120 --> 19:23.920]  go forward against tyranny then I would say okay we'll give you a second chance
[19:23.920 --> 19:31.000]  but we're gonna watch you closely but the way this guy is like a crab and walk
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.840]  sideways I don't like it but it is a big plus that Lou Dobbs is saying New
[19:35.840 --> 19:39.960]  World Order World Governments taking over it's a scam Glenn Beck is saying it on
[19:39.960 --> 19:46.720]  Fox I mean folks but we were saying at 13 years ago do you understand everything
[19:46.720 --> 19:49.680]  we've said has been true everything we've said has been accurate because we're
[19:49.680 --> 19:53.720]  only going off the globalist own documents we're gonna break more of this
[19:53.720 --> 19:57.080]  down with Bob Chapman coming up later but first your phone call straight ahead
[19:57.080 --> 20:02.720]  be sure and check out prison planet TV I am so frustrated I can't seem to
[20:02.720 --> 20:07.160]  remember anything anymore what seriously my memory and attention span is
[20:07.160 --> 20:11.160]  terrible I read something and forget I forget people's names I hear all this
[20:11.160 --> 20:14.760]  great information on the radio and I want to tell people but I forget I okay
[20:14.760 --> 20:19.160]  slow down poor attention and memory loss is not your fault factors like
[20:19.160 --> 20:23.200]  fluoride in the water aluminum and deodorants genetically modified foods
[20:23.200 --> 20:27.560]  the way the education system taught you it's all meant to dumb you down you know

[21:06.800 --> 21:11.360]  country the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy
[21:11.360 --> 21:15.520]  bin Laden this is his ammo we have to look to the Middle East we have to look

[21:20.240 --> 21:24.360]  the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States some

[21:28.240 --> 21:34.360]  spying in and on the US I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[21:34.360 --> 21:39.000]  and Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI the Saudi

[25:56.280 --> 26:01.480]  about that glimbeck I was watching that myself and and you're you're right it's
[26:01.480 --> 26:06.440]  about the fact that Fox is discredited that glimbeck's bringing this stuff up
[26:06.440 --> 26:14.000]  now there has to be some hokey again Punch and Judy show media of a voice of
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  dissent now Fox News is who's played cheerleader to Bush for the last eight
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.640]  years it's going to be suddenly this voice of reason and Obama mania here
[26:25.640 --> 26:29.800]  and because it's so discredited and because it's so discredited now when I
[26:29.800 --> 26:33.480]  say they're setting up a world government bank when it's in the financial
[26:33.480 --> 26:36.520]  times of London when it's in the Wall Street Journal when it's in Newsweek
[26:36.520 --> 26:42.560]  they'll say you just got that off Fox exactly Alex I mean they have any head
[26:42.560 --> 26:47.280]  I mean I could think of no other comp worse company to keep I mean that for
[26:47.280 --> 26:51.880]  you that for you to be linked up with Fox News I mean just from of course you're
[26:51.880 --> 26:56.360]  not glimbeck said none of this existed we needed to have the army used against
[26:56.360 --> 27:01.480]  us Ron Paul was bad and then as soon as Ron Paul was defeated and and literally
[27:01.480 --> 27:04.680]  Obama copied his grassroots the way the site looked the way they did it
[27:04.680 --> 27:08.000]  everything that was a real grassroots movement they killed it they demonized
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.440]  it and they will all went on TV and said 9-11 truthers are terrorist and then
[27:12.440 --> 27:18.520]  boom suddenly he flips and openly says world governments taking over oh yeah

[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  falling in fire

[34:06.400 --> 34:11.200]  factor have the popular culture folks in here see what they think what's
[34:11.200 --> 34:15.000]  happening in the world and police chief Arde Sveito later in studio in the
[34:15.000 --> 34:24.280]  fourth hour today Bob Chapman coming up in about 26 minutes from now on the
[34:24.280 --> 34:31.720]  economy and same system Obama pushed the real transition of government started
[34:31.720 --> 34:34.520]  months ago even before he got elected and there he was out there pushing in
[34:34.520 --> 34:40.200]  October you've got to pass this banker bill it's got total transparency it will
[34:40.200 --> 34:43.080]  fix everything it will help the people meanwhile they stole it all and said
[34:43.080 --> 34:46.760]  we're not going to tell you where it is the bill says we can do that so they
[34:46.760 --> 34:51.240]  lie to the public remember two years ago there's thousands of these lies when
[34:51.240 --> 34:55.520]  they said don't worry this new bill we've introduced brown the Democrats got
[34:55.520 --> 35:01.160]  control of the house and Senate in 2006 they said don't worry this new bill is
[35:01.160 --> 35:04.920]  an amnesty for the 30 million illegal aliens that we promised but it's
[35:04.920 --> 35:09.960]  secret we're not gonna let you see the bill remember that that's a free society
[35:09.960 --> 35:19.080]  and then senator sessions leaked the bill in an article called 20 loopholes and
[35:19.080 --> 35:23.160]  it wasn't loopholes it said that it was total complete amnesty for all illegal
[35:23.160 --> 35:28.120]  aliens including felons and that for six years anyone who came here will be
[35:28.120 --> 35:33.960]  completely legal and that would automatically re-up after that for
[35:33.960 --> 35:38.760]  another six years and they said okay it was amnesty I mean they are a pack of
[35:38.760 --> 35:43.760]  criminal liars even if you're for amnesty and globalism and open borders
[35:43.760 --> 35:47.880]  which is the globalist plan even if you're suckerball that propaganda do you
[35:47.880 --> 35:54.640]  like being lied to I mean is that a good thing and so that's what they're
[35:54.640 --> 35:58.600]  gonna do they're gonna tell us oh we need to unfreeze the subprime mortgages
[35:58.600 --> 36:02.000]  again give us even more power but they've already got unlimited domestically
[36:02.000 --> 36:10.160]  through fraud and so what is the next thing going to be it's going to be
[36:10.160 --> 36:18.040]  Congress signing over its final authority to an international body we'll
[36:18.040 --> 36:21.560]  talk with Bob Chapman about that right now back to the calls Diane in New York
[36:21.560 --> 36:28.000]  you're on the year Diane I think that Obama's coronation is a good time for me

[36:46.360 --> 36:51.600]  organization a little bit about Mr. Edwards is that right after 9-11 he
[36:51.600 --> 36:54.920]  got on the radio in New York and said please the air is not safe to breathe

[37:38.800 --> 37:44.360]  I'm staying anything else time and that's pretty much it thank you for
[37:44.360 --> 37:47.240]  letting me describe that you bet thank you good to hear from you keep it up
[37:47.240 --> 37:53.400]  Bart in Texas you're on the air hey Alex I wanted to expand a little bit on a
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.520]  comment you made yesterday concerning the Obama presidency where you were kind
[37:58.520 --> 38:02.680]  of predicting a you know assassination attempts or or a rise in gun violence I
[38:02.680 --> 38:07.080]  just wanted to say that I really think that's really accurate when you look at
[38:07.080 --> 38:11.200]  the modus operandi of the neoconservatives they were about projecting
[38:11.200 --> 38:16.360]  power outward their whole their whole position was to get the global empire
[38:16.360 --> 38:21.360]  positioned now the neoliberals they're all about projecting power inward and
[38:21.360 --> 38:24.720]  that's the phase that we're moving in now now a couple of months back or a
[38:24.720 --> 38:28.160]  couple of weeks back you had an article on prison planet that was talking about
[38:28.160 --> 38:32.280]  a gentleman in Austin I think that it's that at a barn was and this guy came up
[38:32.280 --> 38:35.680]  in or it was Washington and was talking about 9 11 truth and like we need to do
[38:35.680 --> 38:40.520]  violence and we need to do this and that I really think we can expect to see as a
[38:40.520 --> 38:44.080]  way of demonizing the Ron Paul movement a way of demonizing the Liberty
[38:44.080 --> 38:48.160]  movement some kind of gun violence that will be directly associated just like
[38:48.160 --> 38:52.200]  the militias were demonized in the 90s under Clinton I think we can look for a
[38:52.200 --> 38:57.320]  program to now demonize the Liberty move yes the new attorney general was the
[38:57.320 --> 39:00.160]  deputy attorney general for Oklahoma City and we even got his emails and
[39:00.160 --> 39:05.200]  documents via lawsuits involved covering up the investigation of that and yes
[39:05.200 --> 39:10.560]  that was a false flag directed against the American people as a pretext to
[39:10.560 --> 39:15.280]  crack down on anti-globalist and yes I believe that you're now going to see
[39:15.280 --> 39:17.960]  that phase but they're also gonna have the international phase in circling
[39:17.960 --> 39:22.800]  Russia not going into Afghanistan the saber-rattling with Iran because you
[39:22.800 --> 39:26.680]  know it's not two different management teams it's the same crew it's just gonna
[39:26.680 --> 39:29.920]  be different rhetoric and a different approach and I got all these emails
[39:29.920 --> 39:34.600]  yesterday saying how dare you cover up the fact that Obama is requesting the
[39:34.600 --> 39:39.320]  Pentagon suspend the kangaroo court trials of the people held between seven
[39:39.320 --> 39:43.640]  to four years depending on the different people they're trying at Guantanamo Bay
[39:43.640 --> 39:50.440]  well they're on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com we did link to the top
[39:50.440 --> 39:54.560]  couple of paragraphs and then a link to the mainstream news stories in fact we
[39:54.560 --> 39:59.760]  put two stories up on each site yesterday about that but then I went on
[39:59.760 --> 40:04.920]  air and pointed out that Bush and others had already talked about suspending
[40:04.920 --> 40:08.600]  that trial because it was too obvious and it wasn't real and the people been
[40:08.600 --> 40:12.440]  held for you know many years and have been tortured and a few weeks ago you
[40:12.440 --> 40:16.200]  could pull it up was a three weeks ago they marched some of the defendants in
[40:16.200 --> 40:20.760]  and the news said they're gonna plead guilty you know showing the scripting
[40:20.760 --> 40:23.840]  the news already knowing and then they suddenly said what do you plead and then
[40:23.840 --> 40:27.320]  they said we've been tortured we've been tortured we didn't do it we don't want
[40:27.320 --> 40:33.080]  to be executed we were because they had promised them if they pled guilty that
[40:33.080 --> 40:36.080]  they wouldn't be executed but then they found out they were going to reverse it
[40:36.080 --> 40:39.280]  and still execute them and so they said we've been tortured we've been tortured
[40:39.280 --> 40:45.440]  it's not real and so again the kangaroo thing is so embarrassing see as ABC
[40:45.440 --> 40:48.440]  News reported and again I'm up to Norhorn we said this six months ago
[40:48.440 --> 40:51.640]  because we saw what the administration was saying they might do you know they
[40:51.640 --> 40:57.120]  float this stuff they said we're going to close Guantanamo or we're looking at
[40:57.120 --> 41:00.640]  it but we're gonna open other camps in other parts of the world well they've
[41:00.640 --> 41:04.720]  already opened those years ago black sites the true ghost sites not the public
[41:04.720 --> 41:09.320]  you know camp they show people at Guantanamo it's bad enough but then ABC
[41:09.320 --> 41:13.280]  News announced that they're gonna have the camps in 14 locations inside the
[41:13.280 --> 41:19.240]  United States South Carolina California Texas other places and so again you know
[41:19.240 --> 41:23.880]  these ignorant obama noids are telling me I'm a Bush supporter and I'm a racist
[41:23.880 --> 41:29.560]  and I'm like no I'm reporting the facts to you you idiots and so again Obama it
[41:29.560 --> 41:34.680]  will be more subtle he will package it better than just Bush's overt arrogance
[41:34.680 --> 41:39.160]  I'll go ahead no I think you're I think you're right and I'm not trying to say
[41:39.160 --> 41:42.840]  at all that I think any of the agenda you know Russia's still floating out there
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.760]  the whole Cretans are the big New Brzezinski's you know whole plans for
[41:47.760 --> 41:52.480]  out there Russian and so yeah the neoliberals really seem to be the
[41:52.480 --> 41:56.080]  Fadians and the Neoconservatives really seem to be the Nazis and it just it
[41:56.080 --> 42:00.800]  but say that's the synergy that's the synergy of the overlords they play they
[42:00.800 --> 42:05.600]  give you the two false choices exactly and that's also the that's why Obama
[42:05.600 --> 42:09.560]  was such a logical choice after Bush because he is literally everything
[42:09.560 --> 42:13.400]  about Bush inverted and I don't just mean his color I mean the way he presents
[42:13.400 --> 42:18.200]  himself the way he speaks and now you know we've energized this entire liberal
[42:18.200 --> 42:23.680]  movement and you know it's just they they they look as a review to Bush as a
[42:23.680 --> 42:28.440]  rebuke to Bush not knowing they've been trapped exactly exactly now we're gonna
[42:28.440 --> 42:31.520]  have to go through the same process that we went with all these good old boys
[42:31.520 --> 42:35.120]  that were you know not bad people that wanted to support Bush and believed in
[42:35.120 --> 42:38.600]  Bush and bought into that archetype now we're gonna have to go to the exact
[42:38.600 --> 42:42.600]  same process on the other side of the fence and it's sophisticated and how do
[42:42.600 --> 42:45.680]  you get a public who doesn't even know where their state capitals are or what
[42:45.680 --> 42:49.440]  the system of government is to understand that you plant the seeds you
[42:49.440 --> 42:53.000]  constantly plant the seeds I mean we already know that there's gonna be an
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.600]  even greater re-emergence of Ron Paul's popularity of popularity the campaign
[42:57.600 --> 43:03.000]  for liberty is exploding you know this we we will pass through that every one
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.280]  individual that's activated in those the truth and it's out there and speaking
[43:06.280 --> 43:10.360]  the truth and putting it is worth a thousand a hundred thousand of these
[43:10.360 --> 43:15.600]  zombies if we must our butts if each of us that's worth a thousand of the
[43:15.600 --> 43:20.560]  zombies takes action and literally burns the candle at both ends and I've you
[43:20.560 --> 43:23.520]  know I told my wife a year ago I said baby let me finish these projects and
[43:23.520 --> 43:27.200]  I'll cut back and I had to tell her last night I said do you want me to cut back
[43:27.200 --> 43:30.440]  because I can't I'm gonna have to work 18 hours a day again and she said do it
[43:30.440 --> 43:34.360]  we don't have a future if you don't do it oh no my children this morning were
[43:34.360 --> 43:36.640]  begging me not to go to work though because they didn't see me yesterday
[43:36.640 --> 43:43.160]  any but I'm doing it because they have no future if I don't no we have to look
[43:43.160 --> 43:47.360]  I've taken up two jobs I'm doing my TV show I'm helping with the campaign for
[43:47.360 --> 43:50.780]  liberty I'm helping with 9-11 truth you're 100% right I'm working on
[43:50.780 --> 43:54.120]  projects on the family land to start getting gardens out there you know
[43:54.120 --> 43:57.360]  everything that I do and that's the way we all have to be now this is militant
[43:57.360 --> 44:00.720]  I've watched you for years and I've been amazed at the energy that you put into
[44:00.720 --> 44:04.360]  this but everybody that does that will find that the further you get into this
[44:04.360 --> 44:08.920]  the more real it becomes you will you won't be able to work on anything else I
[44:08.920 --> 44:12.560]  can't play video games anymore I don't enjoy going to the movies anymore
[44:12.560 --> 44:16.560]  because it's just this past-day mind-screen that's projected on everything
[44:16.560 --> 44:19.360]  I sit there and I watch the movie and all I can look at is either the
[44:19.360 --> 44:23.160]  Illuminati symbolism in the movie or I'm thinking about you know all the false
[44:23.160 --> 44:26.640]  messages that are being projected by that entertainment onto the minds in the
[44:26.640 --> 44:30.520]  audience and it's an insult it's an assault when you're conscious you see it
[44:30.520 --> 44:36.680]  all and you're you burn with desire and passion to warn people and it's not even
[44:36.680 --> 44:39.480]  that we're goody-two-shoes of these great humanitarians we know it's about
[44:39.480 --> 44:43.680]  survival and we know how wicked this new world order is and we're desperate to
[44:43.680 --> 44:47.400]  warn people just like if you see a child walking out the street with a big bus
[44:47.400 --> 44:51.800]  coming and you start screaming little boy come here little boy little girl get
[44:51.800 --> 44:55.600]  off the street get off get off and they're just laughing going that bus
[44:55.600 --> 45:03.160]  loves me that bus is we are you know yes we can bob the builder la la la can we
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.280]  fix it yes we can you're like no it's a bus it's a bus it's coming fast little
[45:07.280 --> 45:11.800]  boy and he's like no no the bus driver told me you're the bad man and then you
[45:11.800 --> 45:16.200]  got to watch it just ram them down run them over and I just we will be
[45:16.200 --> 45:19.880]  victorious you know we just we have to keep our heads up we have to keep
[45:19.880 --> 45:22.680]  moving forward and if things are going to get bad and things are going to get
[45:22.680 --> 45:25.800]  bloody than that's God's will but we've planted the seeds for a better tomorrow
[45:25.800 --> 45:30.480]  I hear you good to hear from you Bart let's talk to Matt in Ohio Matt you're
[45:30.480 --> 45:39.720]  on the air my call I watched that silly non-creation yesterday bro I gotta tell
[45:39.720 --> 45:44.760]  you those all those people it was like a herd of sheep lambs to the slaughter yeah
[45:44.760 --> 45:49.600]  yeah our country is turning into a dictatorship it's astounding they built
[45:49.600 --> 45:54.040]  the infrastructure now they're giving you the the cherry on top the messianic
[45:54.040 --> 45:59.840]  leader absolutely I mean when I saw that Alex tell me if you agree with me it
[45:59.840 --> 46:05.040]  reminded me of pictures I saw growing up studying world history of Hitler in the
[46:05.040 --> 46:09.400]  masses before him sir we're making this we're making this film about Obama we
[46:09.400 --> 46:13.840]  have the film shot by the Nazis of the exact same looks on those men and women's
[46:13.840 --> 46:18.600]  faces absolutely that that was the first thing that I thought of when I saw
[46:18.600 --> 46:24.720]  sir you watch it I become nauseous yeah it was just it was absolutely
[46:24.720 --> 46:30.360]  astounding to me I checked Alex we're in big trouble we're about to see another
[46:30.360 --> 46:34.640]  destruction of everything our country was founded on slain the banks the banks
[46:34.640 --> 46:40.120]  two months in had stolen 8.5 trill now we don't know how much they're stealing
[46:40.120 --> 46:44.080]  it's totally secret and they're saying there's an international solution it's
[46:44.080 --> 46:48.000]  coming in two to three weeks and then the Congress says what is it and they say
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.360]  we won't tell you and but then at the same time they're announcing what it is
[46:52.360 --> 46:58.080]  it's a world government bank we pay our carbon taxes to it's news week
[46:58.080 --> 47:02.480]  Financial Times of London Wall Street Journal Glenn Beck is acting like he's
[47:02.480 --> 47:06.440]  against it but not giving details and not telling his listeners how to fight it
[47:06.440 --> 47:10.760]  or how to stop it I mean my god ladies and gentlemen I mean this is so
[47:10.760 --> 47:14.400]  incredible that the I mean to know we're living in this time and to know it's
[47:14.400 --> 47:18.360]  really happening and then even the Liberty Movement the Patriot Movement I
[47:18.360 --> 47:22.560]  listen and I hear and I watch it and most of them don't fully get it I mean I
[47:22.560 --> 47:27.480]  mean this is just off the charts it is it is it's absolutely it's amazing and
[47:27.480 --> 47:33.200]  and you know this is the funny part that the people are allowing this to happen
[47:33.200 --> 47:36.560]  because they believe everything they hear in the media they're too lazy to find
[47:36.560 --> 47:39.800]  the real truth but what happened is Congress got an Aboriginal approval
[47:39.800 --> 47:43.880]  rating the public woke up but only that they were being lied to and they got
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.720]  fooled by the old bait and switch okay yeah bush is bad everybody booing you
[47:47.720 --> 47:51.480]  know the anvil's been lifted off of our chest the wait's been lifted off of our
[47:51.480 --> 47:56.080]  back now here's the new savior and the media all gets behind him but but you
[47:56.080 --> 47:59.120]  know this is a growing process where it took four to six years people to wake up
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.080]  to bush they're gonna wake up to Obama in less than a year and that's Obama's
[48:03.080 --> 48:07.120]  own administration a party there by when he's talking to an inner circle of
[48:07.120 --> 48:11.640]  powerful Democrats you know 300 of them what's he say listen the people aren't
[48:11.640 --> 48:15.360]  gonna like this within a hundred days they're gonna get really upset within
[48:15.360 --> 48:19.400]  the first day he gets in they're not gonna like what he starts doing so you
[48:19.400 --> 48:22.520]  know we've got a circle the wagon so they're having to give pep talks
[48:22.520 --> 48:27.120]  internally to their own people that that they've got a rough road to go down
[48:27.120 --> 48:30.560]  okay they can put out this slick image of invincibility and all this power and
[48:30.560 --> 48:34.200]  they're gonna do it and they may get away with it because it's so big and so
[48:34.200 --> 48:39.200]  outrageous and so incredible but they may not and even if they get their
[48:39.200 --> 48:43.120]  world government publicly launch with us paying taxes to them then we just keep
[48:43.120 --> 48:48.880]  exposing that and saying no I mean you know it it's oh thank you for the call
[48:48.880 --> 48:55.160]  I appreciate it I keep saying I'm staggered by all of this I'm just
[48:55.160 --> 49:00.080]  completely thunderstruck almost dumbstruck by it it's just it's so real
[49:00.080 --> 49:05.280]  it's so tangible it's so out in the open and I still got all these neocon
[49:05.280 --> 49:07.800]  websites and liberal sites writing articles about me every week saying
[49:07.800 --> 49:12.440]  Jones is insane there's no PNAC there's no new world order there's no move for
[49:12.440 --> 49:17.520]  world government he's insane he believes in little green men when all I'm
[49:17.520 --> 49:24.880]  covering is their own documents and these are operatives I to know I mean
[49:24.880 --> 49:32.640]  here's a microcosm of it you know watch it aka Tommy Chung to know that that
[49:32.640 --> 49:36.400]  it's legal to sell water pipes and pipes all over the country except for a few
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.080]  cities to know that the city that they ended up having the make an order so the
[49:41.080 --> 49:47.520]  feds could bust them tried for a year to buy a pipe from Tommy Chung song's
[49:47.520 --> 49:52.440]  website to know that they infiltrated and tried for two years and got an
[49:52.440 --> 50:04.120]  employee in who as an informant or mailed the bong mailed the pipe to the
[50:04.120 --> 50:09.520]  police in the city where it was illegal and that it came out in court that they
[50:09.520 --> 50:13.640]  did that I mean that that's planting and then to know that's what narcotics
[50:13.640 --> 50:18.840]  police way over 80% do and they do it to innocent people and feel good all day
[50:18.840 --> 50:23.040]  my mind doesn't compute that I mean if you're saying we're following the law
[50:23.040 --> 50:26.640]  we're busting drug dealers we're busting people that use drugs well why do you
[50:26.640 --> 50:30.640]  then go frame people that aren't doing anything or aren't breaking the law I
[50:30.640 --> 50:36.000]  mean how do they do that how did how does Homeland Security arrest a woman
[50:36.000 --> 50:43.720]  whose children spill a drink and it's in the LA Times and the feds are in the
[50:43.720 --> 50:45.880]  article defending it and she's going to prison as an

[54:19.320 --> 54:24.120]  even gotten to the fact that when we first announced on air a few days ago
[54:24.120 --> 54:29.280]  that Obama had done his oath of office wrong and had not sworn to protect and
[54:29.280 --> 54:33.880]  defend the Republic people didn't believe us then it came out the mainstream
[54:33.880 --> 54:40.200]  news and then he was re-administered the oath yesterday without the Bible and in
[54:40.200 --> 54:46.840]  secret now this is a stunt talk about a cultic talk about New World Order she
[54:46.840 --> 54:50.520]  they're letting you know things are different now he isn't gonna publicly do
[54:50.520 --> 54:53.240]  it right and then when he does it it's gonna be in private and without a Bible
[54:53.240 --> 55:03.760]  I mean they are doing all of this on purpose I want to I want to play him
[55:03.760 --> 55:12.360]  taking the oath of office here it is for listeners I brought Hussein Obama I
[55:12.360 --> 55:19.000]  saw him we swear I brought Hussein Obama to solemnly swear that I will execute
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.080]  the office of president to the United States faithfully and I will execute the
[55:25.080 --> 55:30.320]  off faithfully the president of the United States faithfully and will to
[55:30.320 --> 55:34.800]  the best of my ability and will to best my ability preserve protect and defend
[55:34.800 --> 55:38.600]  the Constitution of the United States preserve protect and defend the
[55:38.600 --> 55:42.440]  Constitution of the United States so help you God so help me God congratulations
[55:42.440 --> 55:50.660]  mr. President all right I want to get started with this now before Bob
[55:50.660 --> 55:54.320]  Shatman gets on I talked about this Fox News piece I'm gonna play this with Ron
[55:54.320 --> 55:57.760]  Paul last night on Fox News on Back's new show that we're gonna analyze it and
[55:57.760 --> 56:06.440]  critique it so here is that you know I just like you man I watch the news and I
[56:06.440 --> 56:09.280]  see it I'm like wait a minute that's not a separate story these stories are all
[56:09.280 --> 56:12.960]  connected the media never puts them together like a puzzle but that's
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.440]  really what the news is let's put some together first the housing market
[56:17.440 --> 56:21.320]  collapses because banks are forced to make loans with people who can't pay him
[56:21.320 --> 56:27.320]  back next on stop out bonanza stop the banks weren't forced to do that they
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.000]  rewrote the laws so they could give it to people that didn't have money they
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.920]  changed the law where they didn't have fractional reserve banking 10 to 1
[56:33.920 --> 56:38.800]  leveraging it was unlimited and the very same credit so see back's not really
[56:38.800 --> 56:45.020]  doing keep going with no results next is that money coming from oh yeah we're
[56:45.020 --> 56:49.040]  printing it in the basement and devaluing our currency it was fine
[56:49.040 --> 56:52.880]  that's only part of it then you've got to pay that money back in taxes to the
[56:52.880 --> 56:58.220]  very banks it's being given to back to it they were starting to nationalize our
[56:58.220 --> 57:01.920]  banks this is pretty good Bank of America will literally become Bank of
[57:01.920 --> 57:05.240]  America which is great because we can say that's not true that's not true just
[57:05.240 --> 57:09.560]  like they did the bait and switch into the Federal Reserve was governmental now
[57:09.560 --> 57:13.440]  everybody knows it's private the new bank of the USA they're talking about is a
[57:13.440 --> 57:17.400]  dual Federal Reserve that is nexused into the international system this has
[57:17.400 --> 57:22.960]  all been announced issuing its own bonds and so all you have is the big
[57:22.960 --> 57:26.560]  mega central banks that already own the controlling stock in Bank of America
[57:26.560 --> 57:32.160]  Chase Manhattan City Bank City and a few others Wells Fargo openly coming in
[57:32.160 --> 57:36.480]  now and merging it all into one here we go we have to spend money on new signs
[57:36.480 --> 57:42.240]  this all forms a big puzzle here it is the government is to blame for each and
[57:42.240 --> 57:47.280]  every one of these pieces stop there the government is not completely to blame
[57:47.280 --> 57:52.160]  I mean when a mafia don sends out a capo to commit a new scam they're both
[57:52.160 --> 57:55.680]  guilty the mafia capo carrying out the operation with the soldiers under him and
[57:55.680 --> 58:02.480]  his boss the dawn above him okay so this is international bankers that have
[58:02.480 --> 58:06.680]  engineered all of this this is Barack Obama who was their main front man when
[58:06.680 --> 58:09.400]  it wasn't gonna pass who went to the floor of the House and Senate and
[58:09.400 --> 58:16.120]  demanded it pass okay the government is to blame for writing the blank check
[58:16.120 --> 58:21.440]  under threat of martial law via the executive to do it though let's keep
[58:21.440 --> 58:26.880]  rolling a bit more isn't an Obama is he Bush on steroids and how long is this
[58:26.880 --> 58:31.440]  gonna last before somebody says okay this isn't making any sense to me
[58:31.440 --> 58:36.520]  making great sense is a giant heist only thing you said true back there is that
[58:36.520 --> 58:45.960]  this is George Bush on steroids thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit

[1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:23.040]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones Bob Chapman's coming up in
[1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:27.000]  the next segment then Joe Rogan's in skit in studio and then the Austin
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:31.040]  police chief in studio continue with open phones as well by the special
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:35.120]  holding I wanted to play a little bit of Ron Paul on Glenn Beck last night when
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:40.560]  back who nine months ago ten months ago and look like Ron Paul might be able to
[1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:44.120]  win he came out and said Ron Paul supports me to have the army engage
[1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:48.040]  them as domestic enemies but that was back when Ron Paul could win now Beck
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:50.680]  has to act like he's exposing the new world order because they know that's
[1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:54.720]  what the majority of the public are who aren't on the Obama Kool-Aid so we're
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:59.040]  analyzing this here it is Bush on steroids and how long is this gonna
[1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:03.680]  last before somebody says okay I this isn't making any sense to me anymore
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:07.400]  Republican Congressman and former presidential candidate Ron Paul is
[1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:12.880]  joining us now hello Congressman how are you good nice to be with you you know
[1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:18.040]  the more I read of the founding fathers and the more I read your words you can
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:22.040]  they're almost interchangeable let me let me start with the words of Thomas
[1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:26.880]  Jefferson here it is I sincerely believe that banking establishments are more
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:30.960]  dangerous than standing armories and the principle of spending money to be paid
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:35.680]  by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling faturity on a large
[1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:39.880]  scale wanted to get you on because I don't know if faturity is a real word
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:47.320]  futurity food any idea no okay anyway Thomas Jefferson is basically saying
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:53.000]  the banks stealing from our children and funding us is a really bad thing and
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.720]  the banks are a really bad thing when we get into bed with them and that's
[1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:02.240]  exactly what we're doing you've been crying out in the wilderness for a long
[1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:05.120]  time and people haven't really been listening to you and you know what
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:09.840]  congressman I don't know if they're listening to you yet what well that's
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:16.320]  because you said they were terrorist Beck and said Ron Paul was dangerous that's
[1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:22.960]  because you help just slow down our movement pal that's why but people
[1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:25.720]  actually are listening there is putting out the disinfo people are listening
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:30.600]  that's why you've got him on that's it gonna take I think it's gonna take a
[1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:35.800]  collapse of the dollar because there's no intent here in Washington to change
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:39.920]  its ways we're spending more borrowing more and printing more and that's why
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:43.520]  we're in the trouble that we're in well congressman it's worse than that it's
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:47.160]  all being taken offshore by design to bankrupt us it's not they're screwing
[1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:50.280]  up and doing the wrong thing and don't know what they're doing you know these
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:53.080]  things they call banks that are more dangerous than standing armies aren't
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:58.400]  even classic banks it's money changers that run Ponzi scheme scams and bankrupt
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:03.680]  and buy off governments it's called the Rothschilds so since we're not gonna do
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:07.240]  that all the burden is placed on the value of the dollar you can't create
[1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:10.800]  trillions and trillions of dollars and think we can bail out all the bad
[1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:15.640]  investments and they're not bailing out the bad investments they're writing that
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:19.840]  off and letting it sit there and letting the people get a hit for it while they
[1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:24.240]  take it and buy up the real assets the yet that's all we seem to be doing here
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:28.720]  and it's sort of it's sort of contagious you know we have appropriated money to
[1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:34.560]  bail out so many big companies and big banks are ready it is the excuse for
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:39.560]  coming back and nobody can be not denied now now you can say well so-and-so needs
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:43.240]  money and there'll be in their logical they say well if you bail out the big
[1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:47.400]  banks and AIG and and all these companies why not bail out the little guy
[1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:52.100]  that's right Larry Flint publisher of hustler and said he wants a five
[1:03:52.100 --> 1:03:56.920]  billion dollar bailout so the bailout is a disease it's contagious it's ongoing
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:04:00.960]  and the result of this will be the destruction of the dollar which to me
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:06.160]  means runaway inflation and political chaos okay very very dangerous hang on
[1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:09.320]  because you're saying runaway you're saying runaway inflation you're
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:14.000]  meaning by my republic we'll barrel full of money kind of stuff to buy a loaf of
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:18.400]  bread is that the kind of inflation you're talking about I think it will end
[1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:21.400]  before it gets that far along they'll come to their senses but it's going to
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:26.120]  be bad come to their senses they're creating the crisis the vortices the
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:30.120]  black hole to destroy everything and then set up their new world order where
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:32.980]  you pay your carbon taxes the private central banks it's all stated
[1:04:32.980 --> 1:04:36.840]  trilateral Commission CFR club around but everybody's lulled to sleep and say
[1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:40.080]  well there's no inflation but if you measure inflation by the increase of
[1:04:40.080 --> 1:04:44.040]  supply of money I mean we're doing it so the inflation is already well that's
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:51.880]  because you've got a depressionary hyper stag inflation okay hyper stag inflation
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:56.040]  my coin term with that top economist on they say that is accurate Bob Chapman

[1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:09.080]  let's go to Bob Chapman Bob big new developments publicly I mean we knew
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:13.200]  what was going to happen first they give the private Federal Reserve and
[1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:18.200]  Treasury unlimited power to have no transparency and steal trillions a week
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:22.320]  and take it offshore and not say where it went the second part of their plan in
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:28.000]  Bretton Woods to which they put out in major publications is a world bank that
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:31.160]  we pay our taxes to that sets the interest rates it controls the world
[1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:34.760]  currencies so we'll have one global currency for nations that are under it
[1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:38.640]  it's just that they will then phase in changing the currencies now gethners
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:41.680]  come before Congress and I won't give you details but it's an international
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:44.920]  solution coming in the next two three weeks and they're talking about it being
[1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:49.920]  very unpopular the next move will be signing over like they did with the
[1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:54.920]  World Trade Organization the power over the Federal Reserve openly to an
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:11:01.680]  international body and the advocation of Congress's authority high treason so
[1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:05.920]  gethner is now announcing this the guy that doesn't pay the taxes to the Federal
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:09.240]  Reserve why should he he works for the private bankers that why would he pay
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:13.120]  taxes to himself so Bob Chapman can you break down this I mean we knew this was
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:18.400]  coming but now they're getting ready to announce it well over in Europe we've
[1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:29.040]  seen strong signs of it from Tony Blair and Scott Sarkovsky in France and they've
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:36.840]  been pushing this international regulatory solution and in my mind most
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:42.880]  of the major currencies are headed to a default in devaluation I'm sure that
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:49.240]  there will be some that won't make it that far but generally speaking there'll
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:55.440]  be a corruption of the fiat money world and so that is being done deliberately
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:12:02.680]  so that they can try to implement these international regulations which in turn
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:10.000]  will lead to an international currency absolutely now they've put out two or
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.640]  three different proposals of how they're going to do this but they told us they
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:19.200]  are doing it what do you think the most likely rollout of this will be probably
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:26.560]  the first collapse and that looks like it might be England and as anybody who
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:32.040]  follows the markets knows that we usually follow England by six to twelve
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:35.960]  months I don't think it's going to happen overnight it'll go into the
[1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:42.600]  talking stage once a key member goes under and England has been chosen for
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:47.200]  that I wire key luminous coming out and bad-mouthing England and saying it's
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:51.320]  bankrupt about to fully collapse I mean clearly then they wanted to collapse if
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:55.320]  they're cheerleading and jumping on up and down on top of it trying to push
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:13:03.040]  under the water that's right and Ireland is close behind now Spain's an
[1:13:03.040 --> 1:13:09.760]  excellent candidate and of course the Eastern European countries such as Latvia
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:16.040]  and Lithuania and I'm sure that those riots we just seen are going to spread
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:22.720]  to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary and we've already had riots in in in Greece
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:29.240]  all of those currencies will probably go under they were even talking about the
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:36.640]  Balkanization of Ukraine and Poland as well and so you know they're on the
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:41.360]  march and that'll be part of the plan to disrupt the international financial
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:46.200]  structure structure in order to get the wood of this new unit is that they're
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:50.760]  dreaming up what is the strategy happen overnight it'll take a while as
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:54.640]  Kissinger said and he's on air saying this is a great opportunity Obama
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:58.600]  because of how he's seen internationally as a world president he'll be able to
[1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:02.600]  sell the new world order so that's why they're energizing him putting all their
[1:14:02.600 --> 1:14:07.560]  power behind them so at one point they're engineering this but at the
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:10.760]  other point it looks like it's so big and dangerous it may get out of their
[1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:16.440]  control can you speak to Obama as their frontman well there's no question that's
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:24.560]  what he is he's certainly not eminently qualified to be president the the
[1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:30.120]  psychological warfare has to be greeted that it has been already because people
[1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:35.280]  except for people who listen to programs like this they they they don't
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:40.280]  even think about another currency they don't think about something like that
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:44.760]  happening it's going to be a big surprise and so it has to be justified
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:54.840]  and the justification is a or some major countries having to say we are going to
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:15:00.680]  devalue our currency and we're not going to pay our debts and when that happens
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:04.360]  they say well this is going to spread all over the place so we better do
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:10.040]  something about it and here's the plan absolutely so they injure the crisis and
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:15.480]  then their solution is of open world government run by this new super
[1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:19.440]  central bank which is made up of the shareholders of Europe the United States
[1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:25.320]  and Japan's central banks a handful of families I'm sure you've seen news week
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:29.560]  and all of them are now saying a world bank a world government to save you how
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:33.420]  are they going to sell that con when even the dumbest idiot knows it's the
[1:15:33.420 --> 1:15:36.880]  central banks that engineered this crisis how are they going to poses the
[1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:43.080]  savior when it went when publicly they engineered it I don't know I that's
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:49.400]  going to be a very very hard sell it may be during that time that we may have
[1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:53.520]  an escalation of warfare in the Middle East as well that's what Ron said
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:16:00.400]  yesterday I didn't hear that are should I say great minds thinking the same
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:05.480]  channels but anyway I've been saying it for weeks and I'm sure he has to this
[1:16:05.480 --> 1:16:13.800]  will be a negative diversion and this will lay the seeds for oh we got to go
[1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:18.640]  do this it's for this war effort against these terrible Muslims in Iran and
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:23.960]  Russia and the same old the same old that we went through during the Second
[1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:29.800]  World War and then for another 30 or 40 years during the Cold War
[1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:36.280]  absolutely let's talk about solutions obviously we've got to mobilize at the
[1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:40.520]  grassroots get the word out that it is the bankers that engineered this and that
[1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:43.880]  they are only going to continue to bankrupt us you know they said four
[1:16:43.880 --> 1:16:47.080]  months ago give us unlimited power and we'll save you the next day they said
[1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:51.080]  we're keeping all the money now they're saying give us world government power and
[1:16:51.080 --> 1:16:54.200]  we'll save you we've got to get the message out to the people these are
[1:16:54.200 --> 1:16:58.880]  criminals but how do we stop the executive through dictatorial measures in
[1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:04.040]  Europe in England in the United States in Australia in Japan ignoring the fact
[1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:08.440]  that 95 98% of people are against this in every poll thousand to one phone calls
[1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:11.960]  to Congress it looks like they're just going to do it and then count on the
[1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:17.080]  Northcom option to suppress the population I think you're right and I
[1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:21.160]  think they're in for a surprise because I don't think the Northcom a calm
[1:17:21.160 --> 1:17:28.840]  operation is going to work and in Europe you're going to get a different
[1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:34.240]  response you're going to get perpetual demonstrations and rioting because by
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:38.800]  and large they have no weapons in America it's different in fact America is the
[1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:44.280]  only place in the world where people generally speaking can have weapons
[1:17:44.280 --> 1:17:49.840]  there are countries we can have them by a registration but very few people have
[1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:53.960]  them there's not that many in this they are the United States illegally and the
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:57.920]  United States has the history of being very violent piratical people let's just
[1:17:57.920 --> 1:18:02.280]  face it we are the motley crew anybody whether it was black white who came here
[1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:08.440]  came through adversity warfare ongoing tribal warfare I mean that's why that's
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:15.160]  why we're so warlock and that's true it is a race apart if you can call it that
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:20.240]  and they get that they're gonna have the hands full I talk about this every day
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:25.040]  on the air and this is what it's gonna end up in the streets in America in the
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:32.240]  world the way that the world is going to go will be contingent upon the success
[1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:37.320]  of the American people suppressing their own government well I see them though
[1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:42.440]  playing the card of using the shootouts and death and destruction as a pretext
[1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:47.160]  to bring an even more international control in intending for that to be a
[1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:52.400]  disaster but that's the game just just level the United States well I think
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:57.360]  they're gonna have a hard time bringing in people groups perhaps from other
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:01.680]  regions because everybody's gonna have the same problems and you're gonna have
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:09.000]  violent people all over the world in every major city and you what are you
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:14.920]  gonna do Argentina since troops to New Orleans and as soon as the troops get on

[1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:51.760]  late with bob Chapman at the international forecaster.com joining us
[1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:54.880]  partly the largest newsletter in the world until he
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:58.560]  retired for a few years came back formerly the biggest gold and silver broker
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:02.080]  individually in the world. I want to bring Ted Anderson up the
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:05.840]  owner of the Genesis network in the gold and silver business for 30 years
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:08.640]  they've been trying to suppress the price of gold but it's way up again this
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:11.680]  week Ted bought it when it was a lot lower it can pass on
[1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:17.040]  those savings and he's got a quick offer for you today on gold and silver coins
[1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:21.920]  but before we go to Ted here for a moment bob Chapman how important is it now
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:27.600]  before the true hyperinflation sets in to get into gold and silver?
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:35.280]  I there is no explanation other than the fact that you must do it if you want to
[1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:39.440]  be able to stay out of financial harm's way
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:47.440]  in the 1930s everything went down 60 to 90 percent gold did not it went up
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:53.920]  and so with that said I think the only place to be is in gold ultimately
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:58.720]  silver's good but it performs a somewhat different function
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:03.360]  but you've got to get in now before the thing takes up because it's been
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:09.120]  suppressed by the government they started doing this in 1966
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:13.040]  and in a very very serious way starting in 1988
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:18.400]  and gold today should be selling at least at two thousand dollars an ounce
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:22.720]  and it's not today it's selling somewhere in the vicinity
[1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:27.520]  of perhaps eight hundred and sixty dollars an ounce yeah it's eight fifty
[1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:30.960]  seven fifty we got a long way to go well let me just say this
[1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:33.440]  ladies and gentlemen not only do you need gold and silver need to get it from a
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:36.800]  place that has fabulous deals because it's a big outfit
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:40.640]  been in business for decades and has the sources a lot of places are sold out
[1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:44.160]  or one coin per person and huge premiums not the case
[1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:49.040]  with ted anderson and minus resources ted tell folks the offer you've got today
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:52.560]  yeah yeah alex actually what i priced out what it would be to replace these
[1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:56.160]  coins right now if i entered in the marketplace at today's prices
[1:26:56.160 --> 1:27:00.560]  i have the francs right now at 202 that coin right now would be 212
[1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:05.040]  i have the british sovereign right now at 250 that coin right now would be 259
[1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:07.760]  one of the things i'm getting my hands on right now
[1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:11.440]  is the buffalo coin and i think that's just a fabulous coin because it's so hard
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:12.400]  to get
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:16.480]  but right now i haven't met a thousand and uh... one thousand and thirty six
[1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:20.240]  dollars you know i watch that back interview to he's talking about a 70
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:23.840]  percent increase in m three i'm looking around to see what supports those
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:26.800]  numbers but i know that the money supply has gone up like crazy
[1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:30.320]  and the feds not going to tell us what the what the numbers are anymore they
[1:27:30.320 --> 1:27:31.520]  don't do that
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:33.600]  so you know
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:36.960]  well again now that's an incredible deal on the francs and the sovereigns
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:39.200]  right down at bullion prices and you've got them
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:42.560]  in stock the buffalos are at huge premiums everywhere else that has a
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:45.600]  small premium but it's the best deal you'll find a challenge you to
[1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:49.120]  look ladies and gentlemen give minus resources a call at 800
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:53.280]  six eight six two two three seven eight hundred six eight six
[1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:56.320]  two two three seven what a silver do you have to add
[1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:59.440]  yeah the silver right now is the walking liberty half still i mean you can get
[1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:02.240]  into the dollars and they're trading right around 20 bucks
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:05.200]  but you can get into the walking liberty halves and they're currently at
[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:09.280]  eight eight dollars and 40 cents which puts them down to 16
[1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:14.080]  that's a dollar 60 per ounce uh or per half ounce less than what you're
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:17.680]  paying with the full dollars yeah right it's a much better buying at this
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:20.800]  particular time if you don't have a silver you better get into it because
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:24.160]  it is the poor man's money when it comes down to the buying
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:28.240]  groceries and gas you need a silver and this isn't a panacea but it's the
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:31.680]  best bet out there it's what the elites doing going into these insane times
[1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:35.120]  where they're devaluing the currency on top of a depression on main street
[1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:38.720]  killing the real economy shutting off liquidate everybody else only giving it
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:41.520]  to the elites so they can buy everything up that's what's happening
[1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:47.200]  hyper stag inflation 800 six eight six two two three seven are those good deals
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:52.800]  bob Chapman they certainly are and hopefully uh kit can go out and get
[1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:55.520]  some more for the people who call into mitis
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:29:00.000]  and you you've got to buy at these prices it they're not going to stay here
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:07.600]  long and we've got ubs and city group and jp morgan chase
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:11.520]  a dutch bank all calling for higher gold prices
[1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:16.080]  anywhere from nine hundred dollars to two thousand dollars
[1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:21.840]  over the next year or two so and you know they're not pro gold believe me
[1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:26.080]  and so they know what's going on eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:29.680]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven are minus resources
[1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:32.880]  dot com or gc n live dot com to link through stay there bob i want to talk
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:35.760]  to you a little bit more about why they rated 19

[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:42.720]  signifies and i want to get ted's take on it

[1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:12.320]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[1:33:12.320 --> 1:33:15.600]  you know a lot of people in the patriot movement in the anti-fellow reserve
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:18.800]  movement the libertarian movement the bonnese crowd now there's they're all
[1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:22.880]  for gold and silver but they're also for offshore banks where it's not even
[1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:26.400]  money laundering or uh i mean in criminal you just put
[1:33:26.400 --> 1:33:30.480]  gold or silver in luxembourg or switzerland or the bahamas
[1:33:30.480 --> 1:33:35.920]  but the oecd has been calling those tax havens in decades ago when i first
[1:33:35.920 --> 1:33:38.640]  started researching said their main goal was to shut those down
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:41.840]  for the general public and the nouveau riche the new wealth
[1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:48.720]  the leader allowed to 19 000 plus smaller accounts
[1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:52.960]  uh totaling around what 12 billion dollars
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:57.920]  was grabbed out of ubs alone and they've indicted the us head of it the big
[1:33:57.920 --> 1:34:01.280]  swiss bank ubs that happened two weeks ago
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:04.400]  and this is what i keep telling people you know keeping your keep your silver
[1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:07.680]  and a vault in europe keep your gold and a vault no keep it
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:11.680]  uh wherever you think it's safe near at hand people say well they could still
[1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:13.760]  come take it yeah they could come blow your head off
[1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:16.880]  they could come put you in a fema camp they could throw you in a fiery
[1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:21.280]  furnace with uh i mean they could do whatever
[1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:24.640]  so and i mean that sarcastically the point here is
[1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:29.360]  is that we're telling you what the elites do we're telling you the safest bet
[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.480]  uh here safest bet by a long shot is gold and silver
[1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:36.800]  and getting it at great prices uh so that's the bottom line here
[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:40.480]  uh that i'm breaking down for everybody uh today
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:43.040]  so i want to get bob Chapman and then ted's take on this because they say
[1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:46.720]  they're going after all the major tax havens but then when i study things
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:49.600]  we know that's not true the billionaire level elites
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:52.880]  they've got their money in their in their own central bank institutions
[1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:56.640]  and it rips above the swiss bank account or or private numbered account
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:00.560]  uh level so a bob Chapman what does it signify
[1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:04.320]  that the elites are now going after the new vorice accounts
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:08.000]  uh they've been doing it and very very strongly
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:12.320]  for the last 10 years uh most jurisdictions have event
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:16.720]  effectively been shut down uh if you open the count outside the united states
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:20.560]  even if you have more than one passport and one of them happens to be a us
[1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:23.920]  passport uh they want you to sign the w nine
[1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:27.440]  and they turn it over to the u.s government and the reason is so that
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:31.120]  you couldn't avoid taxation if that was an event
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:35.200]  and also they want to know where your money is and this is really what this is
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:39.040]  all about they want to be able to control your money
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:43.040]  no matter where it is in the world if they would like to control it
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:47.280]  and that's what this is all about the collective information
[1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:51.360]  first with americans and europeans and then the rest of the world
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:55.360]  and they totally intend to do that uh whether they're going to get away with
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:35:59.120]  or not remains to be seen and that's why and i know ted
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:02.880]  if he feels the same way i have told people for the last
[1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:09.360]  49 years if you buy gold and silver coins you take delivery
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:14.160]  ted anderson yeah there's there's no other way to be buying gold certificates
[1:36:14.160 --> 1:36:16.560]  to have them stored somewhere you're just asking
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:20.240]  i mean you're you're trying to buy insurance that's not going to be useful
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:24.160]  to you if the economy fails and you have your gold stored
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:28.640]  offshore is overseas in some bank uh... you know
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:31.360]  the we all you have is a certificate it's going to be like you're gonna be
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:33.840]  hungry and you want to eat and all you have is a picture
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:36.480]  of a can of beans rather than having the can of beans
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:39.440]  you need the gold and silver in your possession
[1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:43.120]  not sitting in some hand somewhere else beside the fact
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:46.400]  every single one of these nations that you mentioned in alex
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:51.360]  are all relying on a fiat currency every single one you see the g
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:54.960]  the g seven uh... get together it isn't the
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:58.240]  figureheads of of the of the politicians getting together
[1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:02.240]  it's the central banks and each one of those central banks are printing money
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:05.360]  for nothing and they're lending it to these people we have to service the
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:09.360]  interest on that debt it's just as bad in europe as it is here in the united
[1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:13.440]  states it's not any different you need to have something real
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:17.600]  solid and that you can trust and rely upon and people in europe know this
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:22.560]  alex i got people call me from from everywhere across the entire globe buying
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:26.480]  gold and silver everybody knows they needed it's you can't trust any one
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:30.240]  of these currencies it's like this new world order order organization
[1:37:30.240 --> 1:37:33.600]  and it should be just a gentleman i'll tell you what the elites have
[1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:36.320]  they on real estate they have power they have their own mercenaries but the
[1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:39.360]  main thing they hoard is gold silver jewels and fine art
[1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:42.240]  because that's the only real currency they can carry with them
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:45.200]  they can haul around with them and i'm telling you ladies and gentlemen you
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:47.840]  need to get the golden silver right now with those deals that offered eight
[1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:51.120]  hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:54.800]  six eight six two two three seven and i always spring this on bob

[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:25.120]  international f-o-r-e-c-a-s-t-e-r dot com
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:28.560]  all right uh... and in closing to both of you men
[1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:31.280]  i know we've known they were sending up a world government we knew how they would
[1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:33.200]  do it we knew how they'd implode the economy
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:36.160]  have a global crisis bring in the world banking system
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:38.720]  publicly is the government to pay carbon taxes to
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:42.240]  but now to see the white house put it on white house dot gov last night
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:46.160]  to see gether openly proposing it to see it in newsweek
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:49.920]  to see it in time magazine to see it in all these papers saying it's
[1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:53.360]  i mean it's still hard for me to believe we're now here
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:57.040]  all these decades of talk all the preparation we are now entering the
[1:38:57.040 --> 1:38:59.040]  final phase of the new world order and we
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:01.680]  this is the time when we can actually defeat them
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:06.480]  this is the key point and uh... so so i mean what is it like to see
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:10.400]  with you forty five plus years with you thirty years ten of fighting this
[1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:14.400]  to now see it actually here and to be vindicated
[1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:19.120]  well okay i'll jump in there go ahead yeah okay i was just about to say in
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:22.480]  in my time i can tell you right now alex there people have never been so
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:26.080]  hungry for the truth then then they are right now just
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:28.960]  i've never seen it come to the head like this i've never
[1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:31.840]  you know i knew it was going to happen but i didn't know it was going to happen
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:34.960]  even in my lifetime that it was going to come to this
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:38.640]  and it's interesting to have people opening their eyes i mean i'm hitting
[1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:43.200]  just about everybody everywhere in radio with creature from jekyll island
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:47.440]  ads with bob chapman's newsletter ads i'm trying to feed them the information
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:50.160]  that'll give them the answers that they're so hungry for
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:54.800]  because the bologna that's coming from uh... the mainstream media
[1:39:54.800 --> 1:39:58.640]  is not answering their questions they know what they want absolutely i got
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:02.400]  joe rogan about to come in studio we play this clip about the poison light bulbs
[1:40:02.400 --> 1:40:05.760]  they're making everybody take with mercury and lead but also the cell phone
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:09.520]  type radiation they're putting off that's coming up in a moment but bob
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:14.560]  comment on that we're gonna let you guys go they opened a window of opportunity
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:18.560]  for themselves to implement world currency and world government
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:23.120]  but it also that when that window is open it gives us the opportunity to do
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:27.840]  exactly what alex is talking about we've got to hit them hit them and hit them
[1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:31.360]  with the truth by getting to the public and letting the public know what they're
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:34.800]  up to and get in a in raged public
[1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:38.560]  during a time when it's massive unemployment yes we've got to carry the
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:41.920]  ball this is an opportunity for them an opportunity for liberty
[1:40:41.920 --> 1:40:44.880]  this is the time for the maximum effort ladies and gentlemen
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:47.920]  look obama's even said it the white house has said it they've got two hundred
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:50.320]  days to ram through the total world government
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:53.840]  they know it's unpopular biden has said it we can defeat it
[1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:56.960]  again call ten anderson call minus resources to protect yourselves with
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:01.040]  precious metals eight hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred

[1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:18.400]  buddy in studio to talk about a host of issues with him
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:22.400]  for the next hour and 15 minutes and then we've got the austin police chief in
[1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:26.160]  studio to talk about a host of important issues uh as well dealing with the
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:29.040]  police state and does the austin police chief support
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:32.880]  the feds now charging thousands of people a month with terrorism charges
[1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:35.920]  for things like spanking their children or spelling a bloody marrying
[1:41:35.920 --> 1:41:38.960]  on an airplane i'm not kidding we're going to be talking about that coming up
[1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:43.600]  but first this is a mainline tv news report and i just want to play a clip
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:46.240]  of it just to say this is what real news is like
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:50.160]  because they admit that the the the level of electromagnetic radiation
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:53.120]  coming off these new light bulbs that led the mercury in them
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:57.440]  it is so deadly it is so bad for you and this is what the internationalists
[1:41:57.440 --> 1:42:00.800]  have standardized worldwide to make the law that people must use
[1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:03.120]  so let's play this clip and then we'll go live
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:07.040]  simulcasting in five minutes not just on the radio but also at prison planet
[1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:09.840]  dot tv so folks go over to prison planet dot tv log on
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:14.560]  everybody start your engines Joe Rogan and t minus five minutes stay with us
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:18.480]  so we told you how these energy saving light bulbs may be causing skin rashes
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:23.040]  in some people but that's not the only potential problem we've uncovered
[1:42:23.040 --> 1:42:26.480]  just listen to what others say is happening to them
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:30.640]  here's part two dirty energy
[1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:37.840]  this is reading five hundred and eighty roughly
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:42.080]  so once again we have a really bad bulb what exactly is she doing
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:46.480]  well this is dr magda habis and she's testing all sorts of bulbs for dirty
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:51.040]  electricity dirty what dirty electricity
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:54.720]  an expert in her field basically she measures power quality
[1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:57.920]  and radio frequencies that different bulbs give off
[1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:02.560]  do you see that's jumped up to over 400 so just one light bulb can give
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:05.680]  very very high readings and there's no way of knowing that this is worse than
[1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:10.400]  the others just by looking at the package she says on her meter for a bulb
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:15.360]  to be considered clean it should read less than 50
[1:43:15.360 --> 1:43:19.440]  a lot of people are responding negatively to these light bulbs
[1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:23.360]  they get headaches they get other body aches and pains
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:26.960]  some of them have difficulty sleeping they're tired
[1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:30.320]  some have mood disorders unfortunately they have been told
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:34.160]  but these light bulbs might be making people in in their homesick
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:37.280]  so one light bulb gives 500 can you imagine just
[1:43:37.280 --> 1:43:41.920]  two of them four of them would put them over a thousand
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:46.160]  can i turn it off okay all this is controversial
[1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:49.760]  scientists do not agree if people can suffer from what's called
[1:43:49.760 --> 1:43:53.760]  electromagnetic hypersensitivity basically getting sick from the
[1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:57.840]  electronic devices we use and the stuff they give off
[1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:01.120]  but what about the people we met who say they're suffering
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:05.200]  like larry newman i was just blindsided by it here's the thing about larry
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:09.280]  newman he's dr newman a neurologist and that migraine
[1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:13.920]  headache hit him like a truck i can tell you from my experience
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:17.440]  there's something about those bulbs that triggered my headache
[1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:21.200]  at his new york clinic he's seeing more and more patients complaining about the
[1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:24.800]  compact fluorescent light bulbs these new light bulbs doc
[1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:28.720]  they're giving i swear they're giving me headaches so i want you to look
[1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:31.680]  right over there he knows some will dismiss what he's saying
[1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:35.280]  they'll say there's no scientific evidence linking the bulbs to headaches
[1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:38.560]  it's never been proven i can tell you from other patients
[1:44:38.560 --> 1:44:42.400]  that they definitely see a relationship to exposure to that light bulb
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:46.480]  and developing a headache we just installed a new light that unfortunately
[1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:50.080]  is not eco-friendly one of those patients is amanda gabbard
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:53.920]  right here um it's like just my forehead feels very warm
[1:44:53.920 --> 1:44:56.960]  and i uh feel the dull pain behind my eyes
[1:44:56.960 --> 1:45:00.480]  a little bit of dizziness and a little bit of fatigue
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:04.000]  in her home you'll only find old-fashioned incandescence
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:08.080]  she got rid of the cfls i'm very confused by it it's it's
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:11.200]  kind of mind-boggling because i think it was just a light bulb what can it really
[1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:14.560]  do and isn't it supposed to be this great thing and it's eco-friendly and
[1:45:14.560 --> 1:45:18.240]  it's wonderful for the environment and everyone's doing it but she can't escape
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:21.280]  it when she took a trip to italy and stayed in this hotel
[1:45:21.280 --> 1:45:24.960]  her room was loaded with the curly bulbs instantly she knew
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:29.120]  i thought oh no i came all the way to europe to have this wonderful vacation
[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:32.160]  i thought it's going to be ruined we had to take them out immediately
[1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:36.000]  once stores start to replace their light bulbs and malls start to replace their
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:39.440]  light bulbs and everybody in their homes start to replace their light bulb
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:42.240]  there's going to be a subset of people with migraine who
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:46.400]  who may not be able to venture out until they find a way around it
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:49.600]  dr christine lay a neurologist and headache expert says
[1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:54.080]  people like amanda prove it is happening and science needs to catch up
[1:45:54.080 --> 1:45:57.200]  i think a lot of times things are introduced and then it's the people
[1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:00.400]  that will begin to say no wait a minute something's going on here something's
[1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:04.240]  not right so what we hope is that as more people speak up
[1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:08.160]  more scientists will begin to become involved health candidate says
[1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:12.240]  yes it's true the compact fluorescence do give off radio frequencies
[1:46:12.240 --> 1:46:16.560]  but they say the amounts are safe and thousands of times below limits that
[1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:19.200]  have been recommended as for the lighting companies
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:22.960]  they say their bulbs meet industry standards and are safe
[1:46:22.960 --> 1:46:26.400]  again no one would talk to us on camera
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:29.520]  health canada has a serious responsibility and they're not
[1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:32.400]  they're not living up to that responsibility they're right now
[1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:35.840]  just trying to deny that there is a problem without recognizing
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:39.680]  um what they should be doing to actually investigate it
[1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:44.400]  rather than just deny it blindly those who suffer say their health problems
[1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:47.840]  are real and there's more to it than just headaches
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:51.760]  they were all throughout my house just about every room in my house had a
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:56.160]  bulb or two in it kevin burn says his pain was like having arthritis
[1:46:56.160 --> 1:46:59.600]  so convinced dirty electricity is well dirty
[1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:03.120]  he quit his job to test other people's homes for what he calls
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:06.640]  electrical pollution starting with the curly bulbs
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:11.120]  when you get closer to the bulb you can see the significant electric field
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:14.560]  that these compact fluorescence bulbs throw
[1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:19.200]  into a room now that's measuring over a thousand volts per meter right there
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:24.080]  and that electric energy is going through you to through your body to ground
[1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:28.320]  i know there's a lot of people that are having adverse reactions to them
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:33.040]  headache fatigue um the chronic pain that i felt
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:36.320]  magda says she's heard it all before the doubts
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:39.920]  questioning whether they're really sick the weather is definitely something
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:42.640]  there uh i mean one of the ways that you can determine whether or not you're
[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:45.920]  sensitive to the light bulbs is if you have them in your home simply turn
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:49.760]  them off for a few days and find out if any of your symptoms disappear the
[1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:55.120]  symptoms that you're concerned about okay let's review uv headaches skin
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:59.040]  problems and of course mercury so the old light bulbs are being banned in
[1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:03.040]  2012 manufacturers are scrambling to create new ones
[1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:06.640]  the best choice for the future may be these leds
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:13.200]  light emitting diodes and it's reading 27 it doesn't contribute to
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:15.840]  ladies and gentlemen we're live we're about to go to break here in a moment
[1:48:15.840 --> 1:48:19.440]  uh joe rogan my good buddy visiting here in austin is busy beating up the
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:22.000]  microphone right now we're gonna talk about a lot of stuff the next hour
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:25.120]  in 10 minutes joe good to have you here good to be here thanks buddy what's
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:28.400]  going on i like how we just shook hands even though we've already shook hands

[1:48:30.800 --> 1:48:34.240]  exactly important are you saying it's bad we did that no
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:36.160]  i'm not saying it's bad it goes always keep it real joe
[1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:41.520]  keep it real it's jones i'm about to fight up how one day closer victory
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:44.080]  you know joe just can't believe i actually really like this this is what
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:46.800]  i'm really i know i believe you like this i've known you for a long time now
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:51.600]  man you know i was thinking we met in 99 so this is actually 10 years you remember
[1:48:51.600 --> 1:48:56.160]  when when when i did my dvd that i filmed in austin the belly of the beast
[1:48:56.160 --> 1:49:00.400]  you know i wore george w bush max and herbert walker bush mass
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:03.200]  we did a little satanic dance to show that it was satanic it was going
[1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:07.440]  bad we went running around the uh the uh the grounds of the state capital
[1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:09.600]  building people thought we were nuts because we were
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:13.120]  you know it was funny that was put out on a dvd i did it and people
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:17.440]  found it and said we found secret video of alex and joe i'm kidding
[1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:20.320]  of alex and joe rogan doing a satanic ceremony and we're like
[1:49:20.320 --> 1:49:25.120]  this is a spoof on them on the bushes this is a public dvd sold in stores
[1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:29.040]  but that's how the the the fake conspiracy theorist that discredit me
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:33.440]  that's how they operate how many fake conspiracy theorists do you believe are
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:36.800]  actually employed by the government to make conspiracy theorists look
[1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:38.960]  ridiculous like when you read about like a guy like
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:41.280]  william cooper like some of the stuff that he said like
[1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:44.960]  about like he thought that kennedy's driver shot kennedy when it wasn't really
[1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:48.480]  it was ridiculous but it's like so crazy that everything else he says you
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:52.080]  got to go what's well i don't think he was an operative but what i think is
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:55.040]  i mean he's just crazy i mean he's better compared to some i mean i have
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:58.000]  documents i go off 99 percent of the time i'm not even
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.080]  speculating i'm going to make an alex joe t-shirt
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:04.720]  and it's going to say underneath it i have documents
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:07.120]  whatever there's anything crazy i've documents ladies and gentlemen i can
[1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:09.520]  show you right now let me ask your question though okay
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:12.400]  there are a few hundred cases going back into the sixties especially with
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:16.400]  coantel pro where they would have activists act crazy say crazy things
[1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:19.200]  of course right i mean it was it's an effective way to do it i mean if you
[1:50:19.200 --> 1:50:22.080]  look at like the way arguments progress on message boards
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:25.520]  as soon as someone believes anything wacky well now shent com now the
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:28.880]  military admits that they are on the web yeah i read that i read that
[1:50:28.880 --> 1:50:31.840]  recently you have documents i have the documents
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:34.800]  we do see but it's fascinating how they have like
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:39.680]  directions on how to troll how to troll people how to bait them in arguments how
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:43.360]  to respond when you're being you know and that's all come out that's all come
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:45.760]  out it's fascinating so so so we know that there
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:48.720]  hundreds have been caught we know sent comms higher tens of thousands and they
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:52.560]  even have private pr firms that do it and so yes it is there but but more
[1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:55.760]  often than not i'm sad to say the crazies it just gets
[1:50:55.760 --> 1:50:58.640]  schizophrenics and people too i mean there are outright nuts stay there
[1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:01.600]  joe rogan in studio ladies and gentlemen the info work is one of the
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:04.560]  insiders plan for a one world government has been initiated with the
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:07.760]  recent bailout international bankers and power brokers
[1:51:07.760 --> 1:51:11.600]  have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world
[1:51:11.600 --> 1:51:14.880]  bank to act as savior but we've only seen the beginning their
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:18.800]  next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times
[1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:22.640]  shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:26.480]  the insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total

[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:33.520]  are currently being prepared to accept phase two of their insidious plan is

[1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:21.920]  over god's green earth perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild
[1:53:21.920 --> 1:53:24.800]  edible plants the cost of learning is minimal
[1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:27.680]  wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere
[1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:31.120]  it's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets

[1:54:04.960 --> 1:54:08.160]  all right this hour and five minutes we got left with joe is just going to go
[1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:11.200]  by so quickly so let's go ahead and get into it during the
[1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:14.320]  breaks we're having even more interesting discussions we're having on air
[1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:17.360]  you were asking me what's this uh ron paul clip i've got on the screen over
[1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:18.960]  here and i was saying i played it earlier where
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:21.600]  suddenly limbeck comes out goes the world government's real international
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:23.520]  bankers are dangerous they're more dangerous than
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:25.920]  astounding armies you know thomas jefferson quotes
[1:54:25.920 --> 1:54:30.240]  what do we do they're bankrupting us by design but now he's doing it on fox
[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:32.560]  news so that's going to discredit that message
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:35.520]  uh but you were bringing up ron paul and his ideas is that why do you think that
[1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:38.880]  it discredits that message i mean i mean if he's saying it on fox news maybe
[1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:41.600]  they're saying it because they really they're really worried about it now
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:44.240]  maybe it's gotten to the point where even the people that were
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:48.160]  you know supposedly supporting a corrupt administration are now scared that
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:51.120]  it's far more corrupt than they had ever believed well let's hope so
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:55.040]  let that's what i when i see a guy like glenn beck i think here's a guy who wants
[1:54:55.040 --> 1:54:59.920]  attention he wants to be a smart guy he wants to be sensible he wants to prove
[1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:03.360]  a point but i feel like a lot of it's like an act i feel like he's
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:07.040]  american apple pie guy and now i heard that he's doing some sort of a
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:10.000]  performance where he's like he has a live show
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  yeah and i'm like okay he's like an entertainer well a year ago he said
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.880]  the army needs to watch and look at and be used against
[1:55:16.880 --> 1:55:21.040]  me about his opinions i mean if he wants to do a live show he's an entertainer
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:24.960]  you know i mean that's really i mean no news person does a live show
[1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:28.640]  they don't even think about that so what what validates his opinions you know
[1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:32.480]  maybe he is a guy that was on the side of it because he
[1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:37.360]  thought that it was the right thing to do or maybe he's mixing in real issues but
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:40.000]  then sandwiching it with more government propaganda what he's doing
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:43.440]  that could be i mean it could be that he's you know this is the new stance
[1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:46.800]  that this is the new stance at fox news is they always need an army or they
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:50.400]  always need an enemy and so now if the enemy isn't the liberals maybe if the
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:52.320]  liberals are in charge and they've decided to
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:54.960]  work with them now you know the idea is that we're supposed to be afraid of
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:55:57.760]  the international banks but it is the international banks that orchestrated
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:02.000]  the collapse i have the documents as they say right and and and you believe
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.960]  that it was orchestrated or do you believe that it was orchestrated and
[1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:08.160]  fell apart because of just human nature and greed and the fact
[1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:11.760]  that these people were willing to take these crazy loans they couldn't pay off
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:15.680]  and houses they couldn't afford and that bankers knew that these houses were
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:19.040]  just never going to just continue to appreciate they were completely over
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:21.200]  inflated you think it's a little bit of both baby
[1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:24.720]  it is a little bit of both because in the lending
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:28.720]  changes they made in the mid and late 90s that allowed subbrokerage in banks to
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:32.320]  run scams and that did happen but the large central banks
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:35.440]  uh... we have their own policy papers and when i went and infiltrated
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:38.560]  bilberberg three years ago and it's in my film in game out for a year and a
[1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:40.960]  half i said they're going to pop the subprime mortgage
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:44.720]  create an international banking crisis and then propose a world bank
[1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:48.080]  that you'll pay carbon taxes to and that was now in newsweek two weeks ago if
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:51.120]  that happens what happens to all the money in america what's the thought
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:54.320]  behind that like everybody who has a million dollars all sudden has a zero
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:58.080]  and we all started scratch well well well well well well the elite have
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:01.920]  transferred the assets while they still had value in the tangible hard
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:05.600]  resources and infrastructure and oil and stuff like that now
[1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:08.800]  do you so is that the thought behind it that they're just going to cancel out
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:12.240]  all the money that they're going to completely implode the dollar
[1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:15.680]  what they're going to do is have a world banking system it's already there but go
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:18.480]  public that will set the currency values
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:21.440]  and that will control the major western government so you'll already have a
[1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:24.560]  world currency but you'll still have your local unit
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:27.840]  kind of like sports illustrated in fifteen different regions or whatever
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:31.200]  but it's still sports illustrated so you still have a dollar you'll still have a
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:36.000]  pay so you'll still have a pound you'll still have a uh... a uh... a euro
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:39.040]  but it's all going to be devalued simultaneously
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:42.800]  now okay here's the question is there a way to stop anything like if this is all
[1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:45.600]  real this is really what's going to happen is there a way to stop it or at
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:48.960]  this point in time should be stopped mean what what do you think should happen
[1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:52.000]  oh it's it's it's probably gonna fail even the bankers are saying their own
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:55.280]  policy reports are public that this is going to be a hard sell
[1:57:55.280 --> 1:57:59.200]  uh... so uh... we're going into one hell of a fight because these these guys
[1:57:59.200 --> 1:58:03.200]  won't give us quarter i mean they're not going to stop well why would so you
[1:58:03.200 --> 1:58:05.680]  eat well so the bankers are saying they're not going to be able to pull it
[1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:08.960]  off they're saying it's very hard for but but but now
[1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:13.200]  since they built the crisis and they're saying they have to do it or it will all
[1:58:13.200 --> 1:58:14.720]  fall apart
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:18.160]  is it possible to read i mean because of this crisis i mean is it possible that
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:21.440]  they could re-engineer to bring it back to life or is it just
[1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:25.200]  i mean would it we don't understand enough about the way that's what's so
[1:58:25.200 --> 1:58:28.960]  psycho about these globalist is they've created a crisis
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:32.400]  we're only going to the next Ponzi scheme will save it which then gives them all
[1:58:32.400 --> 1:58:36.320]  the power so they say to the country you better go with us or it's over and in
[1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:43.200]  a way it's really true we'll be right back in 70 seconds with Joe Rogan

[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:07.120]  an international super craze uh just getting bigger and bigger you've done
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:09.760]  all these big tv shows you see another big tv show you're doing the
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:13.120]  comedian stuff tell us what joe rogan's up to these days well i mean
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:16.800]  primarily my job is always i'm a stand-up comic i mean that's really what i do
[2:01:16.800 --> 2:01:20.960]  everything else uh you know i kind of do for money the ufc is uh

[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:31.040]  and then i do little things on the side sometimes like i just did this thing for
[2:01:31.040 --> 2:01:35.040]  cbs called game show in my head is like a hidden camera comedy game show
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:38.560]  we did eight of them and they're airing all throughout january it's actually
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:43.200]  pretty funny it's a hidden camera comedy game show where they have to do these
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:46.560]  crazy things they have a earpiece in and i'm talking to them and there's hidden
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:50.320]  cameras everywhere so uh but i think we did eight of
[2:01:50.320 --> 2:01:54.320]  those so i think it's uh done uh at the end of this month but i remember you
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:58.080]  saying that about fear factor you go i did this i don't even really want to do
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:01.120]  it i i'm just doing a lot of things i don't think this is gonna go
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:04.000]  that's what i thought when i was first doing it i was like this thing's so
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:08.960]  stupid i was just gonna last less than for six years you know
[2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:12.720]  i mean uh shows like that are you know if you have a a skill if you're a good
[2:02:12.720 --> 2:02:15.040]  host if you're not a host those shows they're fun to do
[2:02:15.040 --> 2:02:19.120]  they're easy well you didn't mad tv too you know i didn't i just did a guest
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:22.240]  appearance on mad tv but then also news radio yeah news radio
[2:02:22.240 --> 2:02:25.040]  what was your favorite what was your favorite show you've ever done news radio
[2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:29.600]  was the most fun creatively because it was it was a comedy it was really fun to
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:33.280]  do and it was you know really it was real acting i mean yeah well i mean you
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:36.080]  know you're playing yourself it's not that hard it's being yourself yeah
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:40.320]  especially sitcom acting you know it's really easy but it was it was a really
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:43.360]  unique opportunity to work with a bunch of really talented people like phil
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:47.360]  hartman and dav foley and andy dick and all the people that were on that show
[2:02:47.360 --> 2:02:49.840]  were just really talented you know more a tyranny and
[2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:54.320]  and it's because of that you know i i got to really appreciate like the craft of
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:58.160]  creating like a good television show so it makes it hard to do another one
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:01.200]  afterwards that's why in a sense that fear factor was a good thing to do
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:03.840]  because it was way better to do that than a crappy sitcom
[2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:07.200]  it's like let's just do this goofy game show you know that's not really
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:10.880]  supposed to be a comedy
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:13.920]  it never happens unless you have a big guest in studio we have multiple
[2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:16.400]  backup lines our connection to the satellite just cut out but we have
[2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:20.320]  backups to satellite you have backups to satellite so the connection cut out and
[2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:23.440]  you think that it's the government is doing this no no it only happens if i
[2:03:23.440 --> 2:03:26.560]  have ron paul or jessie ventura in studio it only happens if charlie
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:29.920]  sheen's on we probably have one of those guests every month and it only happens
[2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:33.600]  when a big guest is on generally well i'm far less threatening than any of
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:37.360]  those gentlemen we have four backups to the satellite so we're fine not worry
[2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:40.400]  about me i'm a comedian
[2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:46.880]  but your real passion is the the stand-up
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:51.200]  yeah stand-up is uh well stand-up is everything stand-up to me is uh you know
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:53.840]  it's life it's like your perception of life
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:57.040]  you know and it's the most fun it's the most uh
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:00.880]  to do it as an art form it's the most rewarding i mean you're making people
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:04.000]  feel better you look you get in front of a room full of people and you make them
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:07.520]  literally their physical state changes and they have a great time and they
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:10.400]  enjoy it and you're kind of getting high off that energy aren't you yeah there's
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:14.320]  the yeah definitely and i think it also not only does it do that i i think it
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:17.360]  enhances your life because i think me without sounding like
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:22.320]  you know gay and hippy what you know what you what you put out when you put
[2:04:22.320 --> 2:04:26.240]  out positive energy i think you know you get positive energy back i think

[2:08:33.200 --> 2:08:37.600]  new world order and it got a little ugly
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:40.720]  well i mean doug's like come up here i didn't want to go up doug's like come
[2:08:40.720 --> 2:08:43.920]  up come up and like man i'm not gonna do comedy i had to listen to his message
[2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:47.440]  three times because he was laughing so hard while he was leaving the message
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:52.160]  describing you going on stage what happened all the chaos that ensued and
[2:08:52.160 --> 2:08:55.040]  you know how you up there you were on stage for like a while too right about
[2:08:55.040 --> 2:08:58.720]  20 minutes that's right you even did uh the man show with him you've done
[2:08:58.720 --> 2:09:02.320]  everything yeah i've done a lot of dumb stuff
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:08.000]  now you've done well lord vader uh vader well yeah i'm the evil guy
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:13.600]  no but uh now there were some troops in the front row and they didn't like me
[2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:17.120]  being anti-war well you know what i mean troops never want to hear that they
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:20.080]  know if they're risking their life going over there they want to think that
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:22.560]  it's for a noble and just cause and you know
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:26.320]  in that sense you know their actions are heroic but i just don't want more
[2:09:26.320 --> 2:09:29.760]  confidence coming back sure and a million and a half dead iraqi's
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:33.600]  well not not only that i mean the whole idea of war in this day and age it's a
[2:09:33.600 --> 2:09:38.320]  shell game you're taking one leader a leader of a group of people
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:42.000]  and saying that he's going to protect them from uh another group of people
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:45.840]  that's wielded by another leader and the u.s puts sedam into begin with told him
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:49.040]  to invade kawaii well i mean the whole conflict and resolution thing that
[2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:52.320]  would the way it's set up it's almost like there has to be war there has to be
[2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:55.600]  problem if there isn't there's no way to keep control of the entire population
[2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:59.760]  and keep them from assimilating into one gigantic mass i mean that's really
[2:09:59.760 --> 2:10:03.120]  what people are holding back said divide the ability to communicate with
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:05.840]  everybody and the ability to think of all of us is just
[2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:09.440]  just brothers and sisters on this planet just fellow human beings that are
[2:10:09.440 --> 2:10:12.400]  playing us off against exactly the playing us off against each other just
[2:10:12.400 --> 2:10:16.720]  going off our bases fears i mean that's what military and that's what
[2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:19.600]  government and leaders have been doing since the beginning of time it's just
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:24.320]  it shouldn't work the same way now as it did when there was no communication
[2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:27.120]  there was no internet it's like now that we have the ability to spread
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:30.080]  information so quickly and you know in that sense you're you're helping that
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:32.320]  along you're you're helping put an end to that
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:36.960]  i mean and eventually it will be that you know you can't trick everybody
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:40.640]  we will have so much access to information it'll be impossible to
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:43.280]  convince someone that there's some people on the other side of the planet
[2:10:43.280 --> 2:10:46.560]  that have never seen them never met them and that they hate them for their
[2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:50.560]  freedom or some other retarded ideas a big brazilian is grand chessboard book
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:55.200]  obama's top advisor 97 said we built a world government but we can't get our
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:10:57.440]  people to go take over our enemies anymore
[2:10:57.440 --> 2:11:00.320]  because they don't see foreigners as their enemies so we've got a
[2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:03.360]  hype that up in the media i mean they admit all this and write books about it
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:07.520]  the whole idea behind government the whole idea behind you know
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:10.240]  governing human beings has got to change you know
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:14.000]  well we've we've got to realize at some point in time as we're evolving
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:17.200]  you know human beings are evolving and right now we're in some sort of an
[2:11:17.200 --> 2:11:20.960]  adolescent stage of evolution you know i think we're devolving right now well
[2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:25.280]  you know that's always coming along with it this because it makes it easier
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:28.960]  because when you make life easier for people and you don't make them
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:32.960]  develop discipline and skill they can just drift through life like a retard
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:35.760]  there's a lot of people that will just do that on instinct that's another thing
[2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:38.320]  that's another thing i'm talking about you joe while you're here
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:42.160]  you also been big into martial arts yourself and train with a lot of the
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:45.760]  people in ultimate fighting don't you well i i do martial arts and i think
[2:11:45.760 --> 2:11:50.000]  that for for your thinking for just just to manage your
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:54.160]  biology as a man i think it's very important to have control
[2:11:54.160 --> 2:11:57.840]  over your your system over your biological system
[2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:02.560]  and i think one big a big effect on a lot of people's life is stress
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:05.840]  just stress from being stuck in traffic or your bills or
[2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:10.560]  not just male stress just natural i mean we're designed to chase things down
[2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:13.920]  and and and beat on animals and stuff i mean that's what we're here for we have
[2:12:13.920 --> 2:12:17.040]  a certain amount of energy that we need to
[2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:20.560]  expire we need to express we need to pump it out of our body
[2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:23.680]  and if we don't do that it's very difficult to manage your emotions
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:26.400]  manage your thinking to think clearly and calmly
[2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:30.080]  and exercise is the best thing for that i don't want to do more of it the best
[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:34.000]  tool for just clear thinking and you know just objective thinking
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:37.360]  just it drains your body of all the unnatural stress
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:40.160]  and allows you to look at things in it with a more even keel
[2:12:40.160 --> 2:12:43.920]  i agree let's shift gears back into politics as you've been very interested
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:48.160]  in this uh glenn beck clip and we played well i was fat i mean it's because it's
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:51.200]  about ron paul really i mean glenn beck like i said i think is a
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:54.400]  interesting talking head but he doesn't say anything that leads me to believe
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:57.200]  that i want to listen to him he just says it well when he's
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:01.520]  when he's talking it seems to me a guy who wants you to believe that he makes
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:04.240]  sense and wants you to believe that you know
[2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:09.360]  he's a sensible man looking out for you you know to me he seems like a showman
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:12.960]  he seems like something that comes off an agar apple pie
[2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:17.280]  douchebag i mean that's what i mean it does come off as uh as uh as
[2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:19.920]  kind of a hokey pitch or it's a three dollar bill
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:22.480]  i want to play part of this clip in a minute so you can hear it but but first
[2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:26.800]  off uh your view of ron paul well i think he's the only guy that's saying
[2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:30.480]  listen we need a radical restructuring of our government
[2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:34.560]  and he's absolutely correct and he is what a real conservative is supposed to
[2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:37.120]  be i mean by all stretches the imagination
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:40.960]  i mean that guy is a real i mean if there's there's no way you can say by
[2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:44.400]  any stretch of the imagination that he's not a conservative i mean he's a real
[2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:48.880]  conservative a fiscal conservative a social conservative but he wants people
[2:13:48.880 --> 2:13:52.640]  to be able to do whatever they want he believes in states rights he believes
[2:13:52.640 --> 2:13:56.000]  that the federal government is completely out of control that it's too big
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:00.240]  he believes that you know we have to uh get rid of the irs it's a flawed
[2:14:00.240 --> 2:14:03.440]  institution he believes we have to get rid of the federal reserve he believes
[2:14:03.440 --> 2:14:06.880]  all these things that totally make sense and when he says these things on
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:10.720]  tv they laugh and they make it like it's a joke like even though we know
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:15.840]  the system is completely it's just completely
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:18.800]  unfixable i mean if you look at the way it is now
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:24.560]  just it's a honeycomb of of corruption and and and just a bureaucratic bs and
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:28.640]  red tape and it's just god it's gigantic that's my next question let's
[2:14:28.640 --> 2:14:31.840]  continue along ron paul it's a business the government is a business
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:35.840]  and we need at this the way this world is structured it's almost like we need
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:38.560]  that business to keep running in this ridiculous manner
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:42.080]  and it's predatory people working like a drug war it's predatory it is predatory
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:45.200]  it it it feeds on other people i mean look the the whole idea
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:49.840]  behind private prisons i mean that's completely insane that people can profit
[2:14:49.840 --> 2:14:52.480]  of other people being in jail well if that's the case then they're gonna
[2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:56.160]  support things that make more people and they do they lobby to keep somebody
[2:14:56.160 --> 2:14:59.920]  caught with a marijuana cigarette in prison making widgets for them
[2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:03.440]  um you're right they do and it's in it's sickening it's like cannibalism i mean
[2:15:03.440 --> 2:15:07.680]  it's it's really like a social form of cannibalism it's unbelievable that it's
[2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:10.960]  legal and that's all stuff that ron paul
[2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:15.520]  we know what what he stands against and any rational reasonable person who
[2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:18.880]  would listen to ron paul talk oh well here's a guy who obviously understands
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:22.800]  the system was calling the economic collapse way in advance 30 years ago
[2:15:22.800 --> 2:15:26.480]  yeah i mean he's he's a brilliant brilliant guy you know and
[2:15:26.480 --> 2:15:29.520]  i mean he says a lot of stuff that i don't believe in like he doesn't believe
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:32.160]  in evolution you know he thinks that evolution's a theory but the point is
[2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:35.200]  he isn't going to make you believe what he's exactly and he's going to make you
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:41.040]  exactly that and that is a true a true conservative a person who's not
[2:15:41.040 --> 2:15:45.040]  he's not a person who's trying to manipulate other people's lives or
[2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:50.480]  change them or or bend them to the world he wants the states to to get off
[2:15:50.480 --> 2:15:53.680]  people's backs themselves exactly and that brings me the next issue
[2:15:53.680 --> 2:15:57.440]  george bush campaign to cut government to not have foreign adventures to not have
[2:15:57.440 --> 2:16:00.640]  wars but his own documents that have now come out peenak show that was their
[2:16:00.640 --> 2:16:04.720]  plan all along that was a betrayal of of true conservatives that that that drank
[2:16:04.720 --> 2:16:08.160]  the kool-aid thinking he would reverse what clinton did right and then it was
[2:16:08.160 --> 2:16:12.320]  far worse than clinton uh... now now with obama bush triple the size of
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:15.040]  government now obama saying he's going to expand it even more
[2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:18.400]  he's saying change is even bigger government bigger state but the people
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:22.400]  coming in and these youth brigades and and and eighteen to twenty four and
[2:16:22.400 --> 2:16:26.240]  it's now on the white house website for service but it's a domestic draft where
[2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:29.280]  you do stuff for the government domestically that's a hundred and
[2:16:29.280 --> 2:16:33.120]  eight degrees from uh... from the bill of rights the constitution
[2:16:33.120 --> 2:16:37.600]  so segue into that uh... what do you think of the change in his change
[2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:41.840]  more the same but uh... of barack obama well i'm definitely apprehensive of a
[2:16:41.840 --> 2:16:45.280]  bigger government no matter what i mean a bigger government to me sounds like
[2:16:45.280 --> 2:16:50.240]  more possibilities for problems but uh... uh... a bigger government that's not
[2:16:50.240 --> 2:16:54.320]  this government you know i mean maybe maybe what he's going to do
[2:16:54.320 --> 2:16:57.920]  will add to it in a positive way i don't know he's totally on the bank
[2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:01.840]  i mean he is the man of the bankers he got the bankered takeover bill
[2:17:01.840 --> 2:17:04.480]  which they made a switch and didn't spend for what they said now they're saying
[2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:07.840]  the money secret i mean he and i'm just telling you and remember the
[2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:10.320]  and i know you're smart guy the day of nine eleven
[2:17:10.320 --> 2:17:12.880]  the day of night sounds condescending but i mean really i know you can grasp
[2:17:12.880 --> 2:17:15.840]  as well people's can't seem to the day of nine eleven i came out and said it's an
[2:17:15.840 --> 2:17:19.280]  inside job here's the evidence you're on the air with me i remember i mean you
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:22.240]  know i don't just make things up i've got just reams of evidence
[2:17:22.240 --> 2:17:25.360]  obama is probably gonna end up being like at all fitler
[2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:28.080]  i mean i'm saying i'm saying if you think bush was bad
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:31.760]  prepare yourself really you really think this can i mean but i know it seems to
[2:17:31.760 --> 2:17:36.320]  be so uh... socially liberal and it seems like he wants to close guantanamo
[2:17:36.320 --> 2:17:39.920]  bay and uh... but see if you bet you that exactly
[2:17:39.920 --> 2:17:43.280]  not really see news admits they're gonna open them up in the u.s
[2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:46.880]  he's shutting that one down paying lip service that he's against it
[2:17:46.880 --> 2:17:50.400]  while opening more and leaving the ghost sites in europe
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:54.640]  you know the the real camps open and what are these real camps in europe
[2:17:54.640 --> 2:17:59.280]  there's a torture camp yo yeah they're in romania uh... they're in latin america
[2:17:59.280 --> 2:18:02.560]  uh... they are uh... in jordan they're in egypt
[2:18:02.560 --> 2:18:06.320]  uh... they're in poland they're in check republic and it is
[2:18:06.320 --> 2:18:09.600]  now but let me ask you this if you think that the new world order is in control
[2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:12.720]  of the world and then they manipulate the world's government why why do they need
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:16.640]  a guantanamo bay why do they need to torture some because people wanted to
[2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:20.480]  why did the catholic church need to have inquisitors to torture people to say
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:24.080]  they committed these crimes or witchcraft because they had to legitimize
[2:18:24.080 --> 2:18:27.280]  the whole suppression thing they were doing they torture you to get fake
[2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:29.200]  confessions here's an example three weeks ago

[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:31.680]  well they don't really mean like new world order as in like darth vader well
[2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:34.080]  well his advisors have written books about what they mean
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:37.120]  and what did they say like ron emmanuel said national force service
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:40.080]  everyone will have to serve and they say the new world order means a world
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:44.800]  government one world government run by the private banks
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:49.840]  what a good idea it's so ridiculous i mean we're never
[2:27:49.840 --> 2:27:53.280]  going to get to the point where uh you know i give you gold and you know
[2:27:53.280 --> 2:27:56.080]  and you give me a side of beef you know we're not going to get to that spot
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:28:00.400]  anymore you know it's always going to be dictated by money and credit and that's
[2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:04.640]  things just get so ethereal they just get so and because they control it because
[2:28:04.640 --> 2:28:08.080]  they control that ether they rule i showed you this article out of the l.a.
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:12.240]  times two days ago and what is this the woman's children spilt the bloody
[2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:15.360]  mary were fighting so she spat it one on the leg
[2:28:15.360 --> 2:28:18.720]  and that then she hit it she hit the kid well but she wasn't charged because
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:22.320]  spanking isn't illegal hurting them is okay she was charged with a disturbance
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:27.280]  as a terrorist on the plane right and was uh is given a big print a prison
[2:28:27.280 --> 2:28:31.120]  sense let me just read it see a prison sentence in flight confrontations can
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:34.160]  lead to terrorism charges reporting from los angeles in Oklahoma city
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:38.240]  tamer jo freeman was on the frontier airlines flight to denver in 2007 when
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:40.640]  her two children began to quarrel she's a reporter
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:43.600]  over the window shade and then spilled the bloody mary in her lap
[2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:46.880]  she spanked each of them on the thigh with three swats was a small incident
[2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:49.760]  one that highlighted the anxiety of september 11 attacks would eventually
[2:28:49.760 --> 2:28:51.920]  have enormous ramifications for freemen and her children
[2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:56.480]  a flight attendant confronted freeman who was reported by hurling a few profanities
[2:28:56.480 --> 2:29:00.160]  and it goes on the incident aboard the frontier flight ultimately led to freeman's
[2:29:00.160 --> 2:29:03.680]  arrest a conviction for a federal felony defined as an act of terrorism
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:07.920]  under the usa patriot act the con the controversial federal law
[2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:11.600]  enacted after 2001 attacks in washington they arrested her didn't allow her to
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:16.560]  have a lawyer under terror charges for three months till she pre pled guilty
[2:29:16.560 --> 2:29:20.240]  so she was locked up for three months and until she pled guilty
[2:29:20.240 --> 2:29:23.360]  see that's what they do in the patriot act but then it goes on to say 200 people
[2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:27.600]  alone on flights charged with terrorism for as much as arguing
[2:29:27.600 --> 2:29:30.960]  says that well they do have like a lot of flight attendants especially
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:34.800]  do have this a crazy attitude like when they tell you to shut off your phone if
[2:29:34.800 --> 2:29:37.600]  you didn't listen to them you know if you weren't paying attention you're in
[2:29:37.600 --> 2:29:40.640]  you know and they'll come over you like like they're soldiers
[2:29:40.640 --> 2:29:43.360]  you know it gets like they have the power to get rid of you

[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:40.960]  minutes after and i'm tempted to bring the police chief in here and
[2:33:40.960 --> 2:33:44.400]  asking police state questions to have joe jump on it oh oh
[2:33:44.400 --> 2:33:48.320]  no i'm here i'll do that over the phone i don't want to get arrested pulling out of
[2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:53.040]  this i didn't mean physically no i know what you mean i mean talk to him jump on
[2:33:53.040 --> 2:33:55.760]  it was a bad idea but i meant that as a joke the police chief's a nice friendly
[2:33:55.760 --> 2:33:58.800]  guy you know i found out from folks that it doesn't matter
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:01.520]  doesn't matter when he goes around at the police station doing alex jones
[2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:05.600]  imitations oh nice so it's very so i so we heard the police chief was friendly
[2:34:05.600 --> 2:34:08.800]  towards us i don't really like what he's doing he does force blood draws at
[2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:12.800]  checkpoints here in austin they draw what and so we called him up and he agreed
[2:34:12.800 --> 2:34:16.640]  to come into studio last for his blood draws yes now why do they do blood draws
[2:34:16.640 --> 2:34:19.600]  at a more accurate way of detecting alcohol but it violates the fourth
[2:34:19.600 --> 2:34:21.920]  amendment you're supposed to be able to refuse that are they're supposed to get
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:24.960]  a warrant but they don't have these rubber stamp warrants and they use the
[2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:29.200]  patriot act to do it wow but it's real nice we'll give you all these excuses for
[2:34:29.200 --> 2:34:31.920]  it he's like oh alex i like your show heard you say there's a hard to do that
[2:34:31.920 --> 2:34:36.240]  and what's his excuse and they'll do it i'll tell you right now i'm sorry what's
[2:34:36.240 --> 2:34:41.200]  his excuse for taking your blood to catch the alcohol in
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:44.640]  if you refuse to give a breathalyzer at a checkpoint which is your fourth amendment
[2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:47.520]  right the courts have said what they're doing is illegal
[2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:51.440]  they just go ahead and prick your finger where they suck they the cops
[2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:55.200]  wow hold you down if need be and suck it out of an ivy like they go into your
[2:34:55.200 --> 2:34:57.120]  vein yeah like when you take blood when you go to a doctor
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:00.880]  hilarious you're gonna trust cops to do that
[2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:04.480]  they tried all they've done it like in tucson and austin a few other cities
[2:35:04.480 --> 2:35:07.440]  uh... they tried it in indiana like four five states are trying it
[2:35:07.440 --> 2:35:10.800]  cities in four five states and the hospitals refuse they show up without
[2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:13.840]  warrants saying take this guy's blood in the hospitals but it's like a giant
[2:35:13.840 --> 2:35:16.960]  fat guy and you can't get a vein cops just keep plunging
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:20.160]  oh
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:24.640]  all right jones i'm gonna say something dirty
[2:35:26.480 --> 2:35:30.800]  well joe after we got caught with that satanic video we did yes the satanic
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:34.080]  video we did in the bathroom of the uh... state capitol house
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:38.800]  whatever it was that building was a state capitol building beautiful building
[2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:42.320]  oh man pot in that bathroom
[2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:46.160]  i didn't know you did that you didn't do that we did it on video man we're
[2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:49.760]  talking about i don't smoke pot i did
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:53.520]  you didn't joe your memory that made you paranoid joe you have it on video
[2:35:53.520 --> 2:35:57.760]  your memory is getting clouded no we have it on video you were in the
[2:35:57.760 --> 2:36:00.800]  uh... it's no it's in the capsity bathroom we pretended it was the
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:03.600]  bathroom of the capitol yes yes for the film
[2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:07.440]  okay i was freaking out no no i'm just playing i was saying oh my god swat
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:12.240]  we did not do that we did not do that no we did not do that
[2:36:12.240 --> 2:36:15.760]  oh my god you're nervous well no because people are gonna you know i
[2:36:15.760 --> 2:36:19.120]  shouldn't even joke and say it was a secret satanic ceremony
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:22.320]  because because it was it's a video put sold in stores
[2:36:22.320 --> 2:36:25.520]  but people grab it and again how could it be a satanic ceremony if we have
[2:36:25.520 --> 2:36:28.240]  rubber george bush masks on
[2:36:28.240 --> 2:36:33.520]  no that that is saying that they say they caught me they say it's secret
[2:36:33.520 --> 2:36:37.200]  it's like every week we we talk here on air and then kind of behind the
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:39.760]  scenes internet stream only i'll talk to guest sometimes
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:43.200]  and then people grab that and say look this was alex jones caught secretly
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:45.600]  saying this as if then that makes it more special
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:48.480]  well that is the problem you know just info yeah
[2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:52.960]  well also with the internet there's so much of you out there there's so many
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:56.480]  times that you've talked so many you know times you've been on the radio and
[2:36:56.480 --> 2:37:00.320]  all of it is available to dissect and and you know you could always find
[2:37:00.320 --> 2:37:03.200]  something i mean if you follow me all day every day
[2:37:03.200 --> 2:37:06.560]  for sure i'm going to be a retard 25 30 minutes a day
[2:37:06.560 --> 2:37:09.680]  you know if you chop that up and just only show that you go
[2:37:09.680 --> 2:37:13.040]  kind of guys retarded well you know well they do worse than that
[2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:16.320]  i'll be speaking out against racist and then they edited together right where
[2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:18.960]  i'm saying you know kill black people wow
[2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:22.240]  in fact they've edited together where i've talked about in tennessee or in
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:24.720]  denver when white supremacists tried to get obama
[2:37:24.720 --> 2:37:27.440]  they edit that together where it's me saying i'm gonna get it well it's going
[2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:31.200]  to get really squirrely when people can actually imitate your voice
[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:34.480]  exactly with a computer and that's not too far away the government's already
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:38.560]  got it but yeah i'm sure i mean sound is you know you can manipulate sound i mean
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:41.840]  you look at what they can do with cgi what they could do with computer graphics
[2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:45.200]  and make you know computer games look so realistic and of course what they can
[2:37:45.200 --> 2:37:48.560]  do in movies i mean it's incredible now i mean they're
[2:37:48.560 --> 2:37:51.280]  going to be able to do that with sound that are at a certain point in time
[2:37:51.280 --> 2:37:55.200]  they are going to be able to say whatever they want and write it out and
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:38:01.280]  have a computer literally speak you know so it could be an exact replica of
[2:38:01.280 --> 2:38:05.760]  alex jones voice you want to be necessary the new world order will
[2:38:05.760 --> 2:38:09.600]  will tell everybody what needs to be done they'll have you in here like uh
[2:38:09.600 --> 2:38:12.720]  like what's that dude that died weekend at bernie's
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:15.360]  that's what you'll be you'll you'll have a stick up your ass you'll be sitting in
[2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:18.720]  that chair and they'll just you know lips move
[2:38:18.720 --> 2:38:22.160]  i've decided i've decided george bush is an all right guy
[2:38:22.160 --> 2:38:26.080]  i've decided i like obama meanwhile i'm wearing cement shoes and like tahoe
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:29.360]  exactly and uh and alex jones just goes on forever
[2:38:29.360 --> 2:38:32.560]  you're all you know i used to believe in the new order but it doesn't exist
[2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:35.280]  now let's cut to the new order capital in the world leader
[2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:39.680]  exactly all your friends will be like man it just doesn't seem like alex
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:45.040]  well you know uh some of the top techies at wired magazine and and some of the
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:47.680]  top uh you know a video analyst in the country
[2:38:47.680 --> 2:38:52.080]  and also in canada and france did they analyze the
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:55.440]  that one i've been lying tape where it looks like
[2:38:55.440 --> 2:39:00.640]  kind of the generic anime uh final fantasy model they use and they just put a
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:04.320]  beard on it right and you can see it's not even a good
[2:39:04.320 --> 2:39:08.080]  uh fake and then they did voice analyzation uh in two different countries
[2:39:08.080 --> 2:39:11.360]  and said and had linguists listened and they ran the real bin laden's voice
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:13.920]  through a voice key and then they ran the fake bin laden
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:17.200]  voice through and said number one it's not even near the voice key so it's not
[2:39:17.200 --> 2:39:20.800]  him wouldn't pass the voice key but then they had linguists listened and said
[2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:24.880]  no that's a westerner who did grow up in the middle east probably jordan they
[2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:28.320]  can even tell the inflections who's lived in the west most of their life or all
[2:39:28.320 --> 2:39:31.760]  their life who then did the voice over for it so
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:36.000]  they proved some language expert that just recreated yeah two of them two of
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:38.640]  well isn't that something that they proved with one of those beheading
[2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:42.800]  videos as well yes those guys were not arabs yes those guys were americans
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:46.160]  yes accents were all wrong and then they also that the body
[2:39:46.160 --> 2:39:49.440]  would not have reacted like that that it would have bled much more when they
[2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:52.960]  were cutting his throat that he was already dead when they did that yes
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:56.720]  and then there was another video that they put out which makes sense i mean if
[2:39:56.720 --> 2:40:00.320]  you want to scare people you want to scare people you get some one wacky
[2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:04.000]  dude that wants to go camping in iraq let's just cut his head off let me tell
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:07.840]  one more story folks show throw up a video graphic throw up the prison
[2:40:07.840 --> 2:40:11.760]  planet dot com a show throw up that graphic throw up the world show folks
[2:40:11.760 --> 2:40:15.760]  if you analyze this graphic this is easy technology and why magazine did this if
[2:40:15.760 --> 2:40:19.520]  you analyze this graphic you will see that it was originally put in in the
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:24.160]  first-generation video layer mm-hmm okay with the bin Laden videos
[2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:28.160]  put out by a group called the intel center which the head guy at it admittedly
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:31.600]  is the protegea donald rumsfeld who didn't just work at the pentagon
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:34.800]  he worked in psych warfare for two decades at the pentagon
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:38.480]  so the former head of psych warfare under rumsfeld when he was previously
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:45.120]  in the department of defense okay he puts out a uh...
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:48.560]  they're the ones always released the bin laden videos and then they found that
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:52.400]  the al-qaeda bug was put in in the same video
[2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:55.600]  layer as the intel center bug
[2:40:55.600 --> 2:40:59.200]  wow well you know the the most hilarious connection
[2:40:59.200 --> 2:41:02.640]  ever with our government and illegal things was that
[2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:06.480]  crashed plane that had been to guantanamo bay several times
[2:41:06.480 --> 2:41:09.680]  oh yeah it was filled with cocaine that crashed in mexico
[2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:13.200]  i mean that's just genius that's just beautiful
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:16.320]  when people don't want to believe that the government's capable of selling
[2:41:16.320 --> 2:41:20.320]  drugs there's people that see billions and billions of dollars being transferred
[2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:23.360]  through the hands of criminals you don't think they would want to get in on that
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:27.120]  you know government that willingly lets people sell cigarettes in this country
[2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:30.000]  you know because they're being paid off they know that cigarettes kill 400
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:33.520]  thousand people a year every year just this country alone and nobody cares i
[2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:37.200]  mean that there's no politicians that are pushing to get cigarettes outlawed
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:39.920]  you know they don't care they don't mind cocaine getting into this country as
[2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:43.280]  long as they could profit on it and the way they profit that way is just
[2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:46.800]  just pure pure profit you know i mean they've been doing that forever if you
[2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:49.760]  look at the story of barry seal and minna arkansas
[2:41:49.760 --> 2:41:53.280]  you know and what happened with him the guy was uh you were about to testify
[2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:57.360]  that he had been smuggling cocaine into the united states forever
[2:41:57.360 --> 2:42:00.960]  with the cia and they shot him when they shot him he had george bush's
[2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:05.360]  home phone number in his pocket yeah that came out
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:09.200]  yeah i know that's i mean if you if you look into that story the government has
[2:42:09.200 --> 2:42:12.800]  been selling drugs for a long time it's uh quite interesting that we're in a
[2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:15.120]  war on drugs when it's very possible that the
[2:42:15.120 --> 2:42:17.760]  government is probably the number one district
[2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:21.120]  distributor of cocaine this in this whole country and heroin you know
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:25.680]  well you notice that they went into afghanistan record within two years
[2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:29.360]  record amount of opium coming out of afghanistan yeah i mean isn't that like
[2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:32.080]  a gigantic percentage of the world's opium supplies
[2:42:32.080 --> 2:42:35.600]  is all from afghanistan 80 percent they controlled that stuff i mean if they
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:39.520]  control why would they there's just you're not going to stop junkies
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:43.440]  people are addicted to opiates they're going to stay addicted i mean a vast
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:46.400]  majority of them you know and they're going to want that stuff
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:50.640]  there's a demand and that demand is to the tune of billions of dollars that's
[2:42:50.640 --> 2:42:54.240]  the same with the vietnam war you know the vietnam war it was a huge junk
[2:42:54.240 --> 2:42:57.120]  running scheme i mean that was a big part of the war
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:01.360]  you know i mean the the if you look into i mean like kevin booth's documentary
[2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:04.400]  was uh really good on on the drug war but if you look in
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:08.160]  the way our our economy is structured it's almost like drugs have to be
[2:43:08.160 --> 2:43:12.480]  illegal it's almost like that's a part of the the whole system itself
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:16.000]  absolutely well i mean if you go back the skull and bones was founded
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:22.080]  by the british uh back in uh 1832 with opium money for the british
[2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:24.480]  he sent me a company that was their main product after t
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:28.320]  and so when they made alcohol illegal so they could jack up prices that went
[2:43:28.320 --> 2:43:30.720]  away they they've been created drug prohibition
[2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:34.160]  when before cocaine and herm was sold in all the drug stores to then make a new
[2:43:34.160 --> 2:43:38.320]  vorice you know to make it popular to jack up the prices and so of course they've
[2:43:38.320 --> 2:43:41.760]  been bringing the drugs in all along and they made it illegal to jack up the
[2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:43.760]  price it's amazing that people don't want to hear
[2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:46.720]  stuff like this they hear things like that and they think it's just wacky
[2:43:46.720 --> 2:43:49.200]  wacky conspiracy theories that the mainline history
[2:43:49.200 --> 2:43:53.120]  yeah it's amazing it is it's it's history and it's history that's going on
[2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:55.840]  right now and people don't want to believe it
[2:43:55.840 --> 2:43:59.200]  it's it's it's kind of interesting you know it's it's interesting how much
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:02.320]  we're willing to bury our head in the sand but why is it bad when there's tens
[2:44:02.320 --> 2:44:05.120]  of thousands of studies and now hundreds of uses
[2:44:05.120 --> 2:44:12.720]  by mainline medical systems for the htc the chemicals that are in marijuana
[2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:16.400]  but then you don't take prozac but you like to smoke a little bit of marijuana
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:18.720]  and you're a criminal and you're a criminal it's ridiculous because they
[2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:21.840]  can't control it it's because it's a plant it's that simple it's like you
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:26.160]  you can't control people growing a plant so you have to make that plant illegal
[2:44:26.160 --> 2:44:29.280]  you can't patent it you can't you know pharmaceutical companies
[2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:33.360]  if it's gonna kill you know a hundred of their different products
[2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:37.280]  if marijuana is a healthier more natural substitute for a hundred of their
[2:44:37.280 --> 2:44:40.480]  products they fight against it you know it what's really fascinating is that
[2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:44.720]  schedule one drugs in this country the ones that are the most illegal oftentimes
[2:44:44.720 --> 2:44:49.200]  are the safest marijuana schedule one drug never killed anyone but prozac
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:52.640]  exactly they admit over 300 000 deaths a year
[2:44:52.640 --> 2:44:56.400]  from prescription drugs or even crystal meth crystal meth heroin those are
[2:44:56.400 --> 2:45:01.200]  scheduled to you know cocaine is scheduled to marijuana is more illegal
[2:45:01.200 --> 2:45:04.080]  and you know and supposedly more dangerous than all them
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:07.520]  meanwhile it's never killed anyone but i always use this statistic 150 people
[2:45:07.520 --> 2:45:09.760]  die every year because coconuts fall in their head
[2:45:09.760 --> 2:45:14.720]  150 zero from paul's statistic we use whenever they're trying to ban guns
[2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:18.080]  using school shootings and this has been the same every year for decades
[2:45:18.080 --> 2:45:21.840]  there are more football deaths than school shooting deaths
[2:45:21.840 --> 2:45:25.520]  every single year here's a statistic i always use when people talk about mix
[2:45:25.520 --> 2:45:30.880]  martial arts how dangerous it is more people have died from girls cheerleading
[2:45:30.880 --> 2:45:36.080]  since 1984 than have died doing martial arts it's those big pyramids they do
[2:45:36.080 --> 2:45:38.320]  they're like 20 feet in the air and fall in there
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:42.720]  yeah four people have died four girls have died since 1980 i think 82 or 84
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:46.320]  it's something like 30 something a year die in high school football yeah
[2:45:46.320 --> 2:45:49.360]  yeah high school football is rough man oh man i'm listening i mean i'm not a lot
[2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:53.680]  of kids get if they don't die they get debilitated listen i got on the
[2:45:53.680 --> 2:45:57.520]  first string and and i was a little guy and then they
[2:45:57.520 --> 2:46:00.880]  when i was a freshman sent me to varsity in a foray school
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:04.080]  and i can add for that season i said i'm getting out of this
[2:46:04.080 --> 2:46:08.240]  yeah there's a lot of guys who die um you know and they're like
[2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:11.040]  there was that one guy that committed suicide of pro football player really
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:14.720]  recently he was in his 40s and they said he had a brain of an 80 year old man
[2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:17.440]  with Parkinson's oh listen a few times i have somebody run
[2:46:17.440 --> 2:46:20.560]  through and some giant black guy run over me and i'd be seeing stars
[2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:23.680]  there's supposed to be a black guy well yeah of course it was a big black guy
[2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:26.320]  no giant white guy why a giant white guy's run over me
[2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:31.120]  the black guy's this carrier well no it just yeah yeah i guess
[2:46:31.120 --> 2:46:34.320]  well no that's who you tended to run over me yeah the white the white guys kind
[2:46:34.320 --> 2:46:36.480]  of let you alone no they ran over me too they just
[2:46:36.480 --> 2:46:39.760]  but i think the few times i got my bell really i think the few times i really
[2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:43.760]  got my my bell rung it was a black guy well there you go
[2:46:43.760 --> 2:46:47.680]  the black athlete yeah they're taking over what's happening and ultimate
[2:46:47.680 --> 2:46:52.640]  fighting with the athletes uh well the ufc is uh right now it's a
[2:46:52.640 --> 2:46:55.120]  really exciting time there's a lot of great fights going on
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:46:59.280]  you know there's a lot of great champions next weekend is huge is bj pen versus
[2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:02.800]  george saint pierre bj pen is the hundred fifty five pound champion and
[2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:05.840]  george saint pierre is a 170 pound champion and both of them are
[2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:09.680]  pound for pound in the top you know three or four guys in the world you know
[2:47:09.680 --> 2:47:12.400]  there's they're the elite so they're little and they're super powerful
[2:47:12.400 --> 2:47:14.640]  yeah well george saint pierre is really about
[2:47:14.640 --> 2:47:19.840]  185 190 and he died it's down to 170 whereas bj really walks around like
[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:23.920]  165 and he bulked up to go to 170 you know so they're
[2:47:23.920 --> 2:47:26.800]  meeting in the middle they're meeting at 170 and i think it's
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:30.720]  a just an awesome fight just two guys that are just born to do this you know
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:35.520]  it's going to be incredible so you're pretty Jones you're pretty excited
[2:47:35.520 --> 2:47:38.000]  about it you want to go you want to go

[2:47:53.760 --> 2:47:57.840]  oh that's crazy jason bermas would kill for that you know the fellow you talk to
[2:47:57.840 --> 2:48:00.560]  who fills in sometimes last time you were on the air he was in studio with
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:04.640]  he's the guy from loose change yeah yeah now what does he what did he do with
[2:48:04.640 --> 2:48:09.520]  loose change was he uh he did a lot of it uh i mean he worked on you know both
[2:48:09.520 --> 2:48:13.120]  the films now i know that like popular science had like a whole
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:16.880]  magazine article dedicated to that's hers publishing hers publishing
[2:48:16.880 --> 2:48:20.240]  yeah that is i mean in the encyclopedia britannica
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:22.880]  next to the word yellow journalism is hers publishing
[2:48:22.880 --> 2:48:26.640]  and they also own a and e and they run these these dramas where
[2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:29.680]  where pot smokers are nine eleven truthers and they're killing people in
[2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:33.120]  her terrorist i can play the clip of the latest one so it's pure propaganda
[2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:37.360]  and they lie they say in the popular mechanics book they say not norad only
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:40.720]  intercepted one plane in all of its history
[2:48:40.720 --> 2:48:44.080]  before nine eleven that was pain stewart and then we go and get the norad
[2:48:44.080 --> 2:48:48.080]  records and the norad spokesman after pain stewart bragging
[2:48:48.080 --> 2:48:52.080]  in this year we've already intercepted 167 aircraft
[2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:54.960]  everybody knows pilots know that if you're playing it's off course go around
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:59.120]  a storm you know they send up f-16s so so so that's one line
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:02.880]  uh they also said that building seven fell because the fuel tank blew up
[2:49:02.880 --> 2:49:08.960]  nist admits that isn't the case now the building seven thing
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:12.560]  you know if you if you look at the way it fell
[2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:16.800]  i mean it looks like a controlled demolition like more so even then
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:20.240]  building one and building two is it possible
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:23.760]  that it was just a flaw in the construction that a gigantic raging
[2:49:23.760 --> 2:49:27.840]  fire inside the building caused it to collapse like that is it even possible
[2:49:27.840 --> 2:49:31.360]  no no they've now they've given five different reasons it fell
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:35.120]  and now the six they said the last five they were wrong right the the new one
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:38.560]  is thermal expansion it's never happened anywhere in a building before
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:41.840]  uh and but that's not even the issue we have all these firefighter and police
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:44.640]  videos now where they're saying get back they're going to blow it up
[2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:47.920]  get back and then bbc do you think that they set it up
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:51.440]  like when they were building it like that i believe they meant to fly
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:53.920]  the pennsylvania plane into it and something happened
[2:49:53.920 --> 2:49:56.720]  not depending on people tell me that the pentagon refused orders and did shoot
[2:49:56.720 --> 2:49:59.840]  the plane down and that they meant later in that morning to have
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:03.040]  flight 93 flying to it so it was already wired and that was a cia
[2:50:03.040 --> 2:50:10.080]  headquarters huh so they still had to blow it up
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:14.080]  so but this is what i don't understand do you believe that it was rigged like
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:18.800]  just just prior to the attacks or do you think that it was constructed with all
[2:50:18.800 --> 2:50:22.400]  this explosives in it like how do you think well we found out we found out i
[2:50:22.400 --> 2:50:24.960]  mean if you want me to go through it i could have you back for an hour
[2:50:24.960 --> 2:50:28.160]  sometime and have the physicist and scientist on it
[2:50:28.160 --> 2:50:32.720]  turns out that they did special construction
[2:50:32.720 --> 2:50:36.640]  and that nasa and then the very guys on this who are doing the cover up are the
[2:50:36.640 --> 2:50:41.200]  experts on a on a putty thermate thermite that they
[2:50:41.200 --> 2:50:45.440]  used to to to just couple rockets in their stages right and that it's explosive
[2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:48.800]  it cuts through things instantly but they had to get through to the frame of the
[2:50:48.800 --> 2:50:52.240]  building they jacketed all this stuff right in 1999
[2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:55.920]  they did a remodel and added new fireproofing and used a special company
[2:50:55.920 --> 2:51:01.040]  connected to the group so they set this up from 1999 they waited until stay there
[2:51:01.040 --> 2:51:04.080]  stay there we go with food prices soaring to all time highs

[2:55:02.640 --> 2:55:06.640]  want a lot of tight window tournaments and kickboxing fights but yeah i haven't
[2:55:06.640 --> 2:55:10.240]  done that in a long time i haven't competed in you know several decades and i
[2:55:10.240 --> 2:55:13.200]  chuck norison and i said who would win between you and bruce lee and he basically
[2:55:13.200 --> 2:55:16.960]  said bruce lee was just an actor i'm a champion what do you think would happen
[2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:21.200]  yeah that's kind of true yeah if i had a bet on had a bet on chuck back in the day
[2:55:21.200 --> 2:55:25.760]  chuck was a badass that was a huge chuck nars fan when chuck was 30 years old how
[2:55:25.760 --> 2:55:28.320]  would he have done an open fight he'd have got his butt work is the grappling
[2:55:28.320 --> 2:55:32.320]  well he would have learned it you know for sure a guaranteed if there was mixed
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:35.520]  martial arts around when chuck noris was around when he was competing
[2:55:35.520 --> 2:55:38.800]  definitely he would have learned it and you know a guy was a champion in
[2:55:38.800 --> 2:55:41.520]  anything whether you're a champion in boxing whether you're a champion in
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:47.440]  wrestling most of it is your ability you're your mental focus and your ability
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:52.080]  to figure out what it what you need to do to get great at something you know and
[2:55:52.080 --> 2:55:55.920]  you can do that if you're if you're good at boxing you can be good at jujitsu
[2:55:55.920 --> 2:55:59.440]  it's the same thing you just have to you know apply the same focus i mean there
[2:55:59.440 --> 2:56:03.040]  are certainly sports where someone has physical advantages you know like hey
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:06.400]  guys rotate the camera around so we can see the police chief in there

[2:56:18.960 --> 2:56:21.600]  Alex Alex's word you're going to put him in a fema camp
[2:56:23.040 --> 2:56:25.440]  if you put him in a fema camp could it please be air conditioned
[2:56:26.160 --> 2:56:30.160]  here rotate it around oh i asked him and listen i asked him last time i said the feds
[2:56:30.160 --> 2:56:34.640]  said with with look i've got a woman going to a fema camp charged under the
[2:56:34.640 --> 2:56:38.400]  patriot act la times i've said this is a bloody merry on a plane i've said this
[2:56:38.400 --> 2:56:42.320]  to you before i'm gonna say it again maybe that chick was a douche bag
[2:56:42.320 --> 2:56:46.160]  she deserves to go to the fema camp is it possible isn't that possible that chick was
[2:56:46.160 --> 2:56:50.240]  a giant pain in the ass and she was a pain in the ass to the uh flight attendants
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:53.680]  and she was a pain in the ass the cops that talked to her when she got up maybe she screams
[2:56:53.680 --> 2:56:57.280]  and yells maybe she likes to curse at people maybe she can't control her temper maybe she
[2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:02.080]  should be locked up maybe she's just a pain should she be charged outside the bill of
[2:57:02.080 --> 2:57:07.120]  rights under the patriot act maybe maybe her look at you groveling that one lady you're
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:13.280]  groveling to the police that's true i'm licking the you turn me over to him listen it's it's like
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:17.680]  i'm doing it for the i want the upper floor in the fema camp hey let me tell you what the view
[2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:22.000]  it's like o brian winston thinks o brian's his friend and when he's in the fema camp jail
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:27.120]  who's o brian who's winston the guy that tortures him in 1984 o brian walks in and he says they
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:32.000]  got you too and he said they got me a long time ago oh he's the guy that's gonna torture winston
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:36.400]  well that's what everybody's worried about and that's what this is look o brian here rotate that
[2:57:36.400 --> 2:57:40.800]  camera around right there camera three showing there's a lock you up there's o brian there's
[2:57:40.800 --> 2:57:47.520]  o brian inside there right now now this has been my take always on police officers and soldiers
[2:57:47.520 --> 2:57:51.440]  and if you want to start blaming the people that are running this world that's one thing
[2:57:51.440 --> 2:57:56.240]  but cops aren't getting paid for that they're not the ones that are profiting off of it and
[2:57:56.240 --> 2:58:00.560]  narcotics officers never plant drugs on people well i think there's there's certainly a lot of
[2:58:00.560 --> 2:58:06.080]  shady stuff that goes on with narks for sure they well they're operating in a shady world
[2:58:06.080 --> 2:58:10.800]  and they're they're watching these young black kids drive around and $150,000 Mercedes is when
[2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:15.280]  they can't even pay their rent you know i think there's a lot of them in a fema camp too fema
[2:58:15.280 --> 2:58:19.760]  camps everybody long as they got a nice air we don't need the bill of rights hell it's good
[2:58:19.760 --> 2:58:23.520]  they charge her with the it's good they charge her with a patriot act and thousands of others in
[2:58:23.520 --> 2:58:29.520]  marijuana cases she might lose your neighbor wait so put the marijuana lady and yelling
[2:58:29.520 --> 2:58:34.160]  marijuana smokers yapping kids use the patriot act on the marijuana smokers spill everything
[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:39.680]  put them in the fema camp put them in the fema camp spill everything the windows i'm alex josey

[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:57.520]  no way to look at it and say well this is a mess this needs to be revamped and he was the only one
[3:01:57.520 --> 3:02:04.160]  that was offering a real radical restructuring of this uh of our government and just staying out of
[3:02:04.160 --> 3:02:08.640]  other people's business and staying out not being the policeman for the world not getting involved
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:12.320]  in all their bs and by the way joe there's no reason to pull it off who knows there's no reason
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:16.240]  you're so successful on the media do your hard-working guy you got in late last night you had three
[3:02:16.240 --> 3:02:20.800]  hours sleep you did a couple hours at kale bj this morning and now you're in studio here and you're
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:24.000]  filing to get some sleep now before the show well i'm doing it for you because you're my friend i mean

[3:02:29.280 --> 3:02:33.120]  great service i mean you're my friend people think you're crazy i think there's a lot of
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:36.720]  the stuff that you say that's just irrefutable and people need to look at that well i appreciate you
[3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:42.880]  joe and the 10 years i've known you uh it's it's always got time for a little walker canes
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:47.920]  you know next week that's on the way bro now but then we're going to be in silver spacesuits
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:52.160]  his old man you think so you know like little jetpacks i would have thought pot would be legal
[3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:56.160]  by now so i'm not really banking on the silver spacesuits but we do have a black president
[3:02:56.160 --> 3:03:00.480]  i would never thought we had that first and then pot would be legal i thought would thought
[3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:04.560]  that we would have pot would be legal and that would be the reason why people would vote in a
[3:03:04.560 --> 3:03:10.640]  black president everybody'd be so high they just go whatever man vote them in obama see i don't
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:15.360]  i don't smoke pop it i'm i'm for decriminalization yeah because 87 percent of drug users only use
[3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:19.520]  it we need to empty the president's well not only that how about this how about all you're doing
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:25.200]  is it's just an experience you're not hurting anyone else and who is one person to tell you
[3:03:25.200 --> 3:03:29.520]  what you can and can't experience it's the the argument that you're saving people from it is
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:34.000]  complete total nonsense there hasn't been a study ever done that shows that there's some sort of a
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:38.640]  negative health effect especially to you know rational use of marijuana it's far safe well
[3:03:38.640 --> 3:03:43.600]  i know there's an alcohol prescription drugs cigarettes kills millions a year millions a year
[3:03:43.600 --> 3:03:48.640]  marijuana has been kills thousands of people every year so does aspirin you know cigarettes
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:55.760]  kill 400 000 in this country every year alcohol kills 90 to 100 000 just of deaths of drinking
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:04:02.080]  themselves to death i mean it's amazing marijuana zero ever but because of the fact that it's been
[3:04:02.080 --> 3:04:07.840]  demonized with propaganda from william randolph hearst and harry anceler in the 30s up until
[3:04:07.840 --> 3:04:11.520]  william randolph hearst that's her's publishing exactly what he the reason why people don't
[3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:15.920]  understand the reason why marijuana was initially made illegal was not because of the psychoactive
[3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:19.920]  effects of the plants it was completely an economic geochemical didn't want people to
[3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:27.040]  wear a polyester not the the not hemp clothes yes hemp is a far more durable fiber than cotton
[3:04:27.040 --> 3:04:31.760]  and unlike cotton it grows everywhere exactly and it's renewable it's much more renewable
[3:04:31.760 --> 3:04:37.440]  than than trees are you can make paper out of it far easier and restore the area in like in a few

[3:09:04.080 --> 3:09:08.480]  make sure that we're looking good for your audience hey do you like meeting Joe rugan that is a good
[3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:13.600]  man yeah actually it was nice talking to him about the jama cart the jama cart that used to be the
[3:09:13.600 --> 3:09:18.000]  the ref there for the ufc is a good friend of mine i've known for many years and catching up on what's
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:24.480]  going on with him too so you're a ufc fan yeah yeah it's a great uh you know it's uh warriors man
[3:09:24.480 --> 3:09:28.960]  we come from a warrior culture and it's good to see uh guys fighting actually it's i don't think
[3:09:28.960 --> 3:09:33.600]  it's as vicious as people think try to make it out to be there are some rules well less folks die
[3:09:33.600 --> 3:09:39.360]  in this than in boxing yeah absolutely i think it's safer but historically it's a sign of a society
[3:09:39.360 --> 3:09:44.320]  in decline when the auditorial events become popular well i think that they've been popular
[3:09:44.320 --> 3:09:49.920]  with humanity throughout our history so i don't know if it's a sign but uh if it's a bad sign
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:53.200]  we're in trouble because we've been doing it forever it was a famous case in miami where the
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:10:00.240]  cop union brought in two big fighters to fight each other and uh did did you ever hear about that
[3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:06.480]  case no i don't have the network of information that you have you seem to be more into what's
[3:10:06.480 --> 3:10:10.480]  going on the world than uh some other folks i don't know about that hey everybody wants to hear
[3:10:10.480 --> 3:10:14.960]  this legendary imitation you do around town and get out in the hall give us an alex jones imitation
[3:10:14.960 --> 3:10:19.360]  chief alex you know i remember when i asked your head if you actually believed half the stuff you
[3:10:19.360 --> 3:10:25.200]  say and you go i can prove it all chief i can prove it all and uh you know tell me more you're
[3:10:25.200 --> 3:10:31.360]  getting in my your co-op to me chief that's as far as i love you though man you know you're a great
[3:10:31.360 --> 3:10:36.240]  person that questions things and well you're nice to say that and that's not a bad thing we need to
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:40.560]  there's reason we have a first amendment of the constitution and uh free press and uh
[3:10:40.560 --> 3:10:46.400]  i'm absolutely an advocate for free press and uh that's why i'm here i don't have nothing to hide
[3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:51.760]  except that needle you got for sucking blood you know hey it's about safety and uh i know that
[3:10:51.760 --> 3:10:57.600]  some folks that is a guy that came on your show how he's the vampire cop and you know about everything
[3:10:57.600 --> 3:11:01.200]  what are you listening to the show monitoring i listen to your show i've watched some of your
[3:11:01.200 --> 3:11:06.400]  dvds oh my god they're fema camps ready yeah your fema camps ready we've got a nice bed for you sat in
[3:11:06.400 --> 3:11:12.400]  sheets just for you what did you want a water bed uh again austin police chief you are more popular
[3:11:12.400 --> 3:11:15.280]  than some of the last police chiefs i think that's because you are reaching out to the community
[3:11:15.840 --> 3:11:20.320]  well i think that we're transparent you know uh one of the organizational philosophy that i have is
[3:11:20.320 --> 3:11:24.800]  that you have to be transparent americans question government they don't trust their government
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:30.240]  and i think that's a good thing and uh transparency breeds trust and trust breeds cooperation i think
[3:11:30.240 --> 3:11:34.560]  that the more that people trust us and know what we're doing the better off we're all going to be
[3:11:34.560 --> 3:11:38.800]  as americans hey during the uh the break you were telling me a story but we got cut off by having to
[3:11:38.800 --> 3:11:46.560]  go on air you said you love seeing uh that herald or uh reveria confrontation uh i was it was very
[3:11:46.560 --> 3:11:52.480]  entertaining because i know you and uh herald though was doing his thing and here comes a
[3:11:53.040 --> 3:11:58.320]  show tonight we're going to the office go hey alex is at it all there and uh at the r and c and it
[3:11:58.320 --> 3:12:02.720]  was uh it was fun to watch and then i got arrested even though we had a permanent did get arrested
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:07.840]  yes for a non authorized sound device and uh but then the police had to let me go because people
[3:12:07.840 --> 3:12:13.200]  surrounded the police station were protesting yeah uh and uh it's all in video i'll give you a copy of
[3:12:13.200 --> 3:12:19.840]  it and to make a long story short uh they then pointed out that the ticket was a $200 fine
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:24.400]  and i shouldn't have been arrested uh and so they let me go so it should have been uh just a site
[3:12:24.400 --> 3:12:28.160]  and release situation where the sites yes i did nothing they i mean i they said come over here and i'm
[3:12:28.160 --> 3:12:32.160]  supposed to use that even permanent for that and i said no they said put him in cuffs i guess they
[3:12:32.160 --> 3:12:36.800]  wanted to incite the crowd of 300 screaming people and then they drug me off but let me tell you
[3:12:36.800 --> 3:12:40.560]  austin police are a little nicer on average in the new york police have you ever been in civilian
[3:12:40.560 --> 3:12:46.960]  clothes and in the new york and had them call you scum and stuff uh no i i i i try not to uh
[3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:52.480]  antagonize police officers when i'm off duty but i don't mean antagonize well you know you start
[3:12:52.480 --> 3:12:57.760]  blowing into your ear with a bullhorn five feet away that might be a that isn't what happened i don't
[3:12:57.760 --> 3:13:01.760]  know if it's right i'm up but you see here i'm up that's not i didn't say that's what happened i'm
[3:13:01.760 --> 3:13:06.000]  just doing an example just implanted that idea antagonistic let's get let's talk about what
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:08.800]  you're doing awesome and i wanted to bring this up because last time i didn't have the articles
[3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:15.920]  in front of me this is and uh this woman uh for uh yelling on the plane yeah uh she was charged under
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:20.640]  the patriot act as a terrorist okay and it was held without bail and wasn't allowed to have a lawyer
[3:13:20.640 --> 3:13:26.400]  under the terrorism act section 802 yeah um right there i mean is that a good use of the patriot act
[3:13:26.400 --> 3:13:31.600]  they promised it wasn't going to be used except for al-qaeda you know i haven't seen this uh this
[3:13:31.600 --> 3:13:36.880]  this charge but i will tell you that i think that the uh the federal government takes a
[3:13:36.880 --> 3:13:42.240]  disrupting uh flights and being disruptive in uh airlines of much more seriously than they used
[3:13:42.240 --> 3:13:47.280]  to but they charge you at under terrorism provisions that then take a lot of your rights away in court
[3:13:47.280 --> 3:13:51.680]  not that i'm aware of but no that's right here but i but i don't have my reading glasses here
[3:13:51.680 --> 3:13:56.400]  let me just read it to you okay it says the it says the incident aboard the frontier flight
[3:13:56.400 --> 3:14:00.800]  opening led to freeman's arrest and conviction for a federal felony to find as an act of terrorism
[3:14:00.800 --> 3:14:06.240]  under the patriot act and she was tried under the patriot act and it says here uh that uh she
[3:14:06.240 --> 3:14:11.440]  yelled at the flight attendant you yeah well i don't know what the result was from the patriot act
[3:14:11.440 --> 3:14:16.720]  but it doesn't uh it doesn't ring like uh pray that's what we had in mind well i mean you've
[3:14:16.720 --> 3:14:21.120]  spoken out against fidel kastrow who's about to kick it and you know you escaped that i mean does
[3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:27.040]  that not sound like cuba well i don't know about like i said what it was what was the penalty
[3:14:27.040 --> 3:14:33.040]  does it say on there uh yeah it's a 10 years in prison i mean it goes on it says for people
[3:14:33.040 --> 3:14:38.080]  only raising their voice not even cussing yeah i don't know i'm not familiar with that case i
[3:14:38.080 --> 3:14:42.560]  think you'd have to take a look out though remember but sometimes when you read news reports they may
[3:14:42.560 --> 3:14:46.720]  not have all the information and listen before anybody talked about this i read section 802 of hr
[3:14:46.720 --> 3:14:53.120]  31 62 past october 27 2001 and it said section 802 any action that a dangerous human life
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:14:57.120]  that's a violation of any federal or state law is hereby an act of terrorism and change the
[3:14:57.120 --> 3:15:01.280]  old definition in the u.s code and then it says you don't get due process you don't get lawyers we
[3:15:01.280 --> 3:15:05.680]  can spy on your lawyers we can strip you of your citizenship take you to guantanamo bay and then
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:10.800]  use uh strong interrogation methods which is a renamed torture and then try you secretly before
[3:15:10.800 --> 3:15:14.640]  a tribunal of the president doesn't it doesn't like tribunals response uh then you would still
[3:15:14.640 --> 3:15:19.120]  be executed in secret that's also nexus is in with the john war defense authorization act
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:24.240]  and the military commissions act but right here it says freeman is one of at least 200 people on
[3:15:24.240 --> 3:15:27.920]  flights who have been convicted under the amended law in most of these cases there was no evidence
[3:15:27.920 --> 3:15:31.520]  that the pastors attempted to hijack the airplane or physically attack any of the flight crew many
[3:15:31.520 --> 3:15:37.360]  have simply involved raising voices foul language and drunken behavior yeah i don't know i'm not
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:41.360]  familiar with the case so i can't really comment on but i will say that uh there's always a there's
[3:15:41.360 --> 3:15:46.880]  a new administration in dc and me and i'm sure that they're looking at uh uh uh presidential
[3:15:46.880 --> 3:15:51.840]  directors of the past and different laws and they may go in a different direction i mean this sounds
[3:15:51.840 --> 3:15:58.160]  like what the founders got mad at at 1776 well based on what you're seeing potentially yeah
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:02.480]  we're the founders evil you know it's where the founders i didn't know them so i can't know what
[3:16:02.480 --> 3:16:08.160]  i mean i mean i have fbi on video and fema teaching police uh in the classified training
[3:16:08.160 --> 3:16:12.960]  that a police officer got us in kansas city the founding fathers were bad i you know what i've
[3:16:12.960 --> 3:16:18.400]  been a cop for 22 years and uh i can't say i've ever heard that so and i would have a problem
[3:16:19.120 --> 3:16:23.920]  uh with somebody teaching my cops at the founding fathers of this country that i think framed an
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:29.120]  outstanding constitution the the spirit and what i'm thinking is a living document that uh
[3:16:29.120 --> 3:16:34.560]  uh that there's a constitution there's something that uh i i think i've taken enough to die for if
[3:16:34.560 --> 3:16:39.360]  i had to all right now i appreciate you presenting yourself for interrogation i'd like you to be
[3:16:39.360 --> 3:16:44.640]  able to talk about here we go uh some of the uh remember you do have to drive out of here and
[3:16:44.640 --> 3:16:54.240]  i'm kidding oh yeah you are a little double meaning yeah so you obviously uh we are neighbors too
[3:16:54.240 --> 3:16:58.480]  don't forget he got a little aggressive last time after the show why did i get aggressive you've
[3:16:58.480 --> 3:17:03.200]  grabbed me by the arm and squeezed it and you said you said you said you really believe this
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:07.120]  stuff and i said yes you said that's not what you said you said i can prove it all to you if i can
[3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:12.640]  prove it all then you started accusing me of uh trying to co-opt you you're co-op this guy's good
[3:17:12.640 --> 3:17:18.720]  this guy's good you see him again we are we're gonna see you as the head of the global fema
[3:17:18.720 --> 3:17:25.600]  commander i don't think so you wear a huge black leather uniform uh no never with like huge steel
[3:17:25.600 --> 3:17:32.560]  high heels these uniforms are friendly or professional or i i really think that we in austin i can only
[3:17:32.560 --> 3:17:37.840]  speak for austin i can't speak for any other entity but uh we we we're about as transparent as
[3:17:37.840 --> 3:17:42.160]  we've been and i think it's paying dividends i think the community sees us in a different light
[3:17:42.160 --> 3:17:45.600]  and that's not a bad thing for what i like is the black and whites because when i'm speeding i can
[3:17:45.600 --> 3:17:50.000]  see him further away you see and then some people don't like him well i like it because i can see
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:53.520]  it further away the old the old white ones were hard for me to see when i'm especially when everything's
[3:17:53.520 --> 3:17:58.160]  white yeah all the cars are right here the reason that we want to go to visibility we visit high
[3:17:58.160 --> 3:18:04.080]  visibility look uh my job is try to deter crime i mean once crimes occurred we've already failed so
[3:18:04.720 --> 3:18:10.320]  by having a highly visible police car uh we hope that has a deterrent effect on people committing
[3:18:10.320 --> 3:18:14.480]  crimes especially now with the economic downturn where i think that uh what's crimes going on it's
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:20.400]  going up and typically when people that normally would not turn to crime uh that want to feed their
[3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:25.600]  family may turn to it and so we have to be highly visible to as a deterrent well i mean i've seen
[3:18:25.600 --> 3:18:28.480]  the statistics and i'm glad you'll admit it's going up a lot of police chiefs don't want to
[3:18:28.480 --> 3:18:35.920]  admit it's going up but it is exploding it is and uh we we we try not to uh you know it is what it is
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:40.880]  you know you try your best and and and and tight tight economic times we need to make sure that we
[3:18:40.880 --> 3:18:45.120]  as a police department that we're positioned to keep people safe because that's our primary function
[3:18:45.120 --> 3:18:48.720]  i think the primary functional government is to keep people safe well i'll say one good thing
[3:18:48.720 --> 3:18:51.760]  that did happen with the awesome police my parents were out of town somebody kind of kicked in the
[3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:57.840]  back door the alarm went off within uh two minutes of the alarm going off the police were there
[3:18:57.840 --> 3:19:01.600]  they went and checked the house closed the door waited for me to get there excellent and i'd you
[3:19:01.600 --> 3:19:05.920]  know drove over and they were very nice so outstanding well you know we instituted because
[3:19:05.920 --> 3:19:10.800]  you know we it's you you don't have an empty checkbook as a police department that the taxpayers
[3:19:10.800 --> 3:19:15.360]  only have so much money they can give us so we now what's called the priority one hot shot calls
[3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:20.960]  that uh when certain uh crimes are occurring we actually respond with lights and signs now code
[3:19:20.960 --> 3:19:25.360]  three and that's had a really tremendously positive impact on our response times also makes the the
[3:19:25.360 --> 3:19:30.160]  thieves uh paranoid because they hear what you know what it was so funny is that you might have
[3:19:30.160 --> 3:19:35.280]  critics out there and you got it you right away figured out why we're doing that you know it the
[3:19:35.280 --> 3:19:39.040]  comfort level of the crooks because they hear those signs they don't know where they're going
[3:19:39.040 --> 3:19:44.560]  we've actually been going to a separate hot shot call one instance where some guys were off and it
[3:19:44.560 --> 3:19:49.040]  flushes another one out yes and uh they they hadn't even gotten the money from the restaurant yet
[3:19:49.040 --> 3:19:54.480]  they heard our police sirens they left and then they weren't even we weren't even going to that

[3:22:08.240 --> 3:22:13.440]  to a record high in 1999 reaching a peak of fourteen point eight trillion dollars marking
[3:22:13.440 --> 3:22:19.200]  ten point five seven percent annual increase outpacing its previous ten years the u.s economy
[3:22:19.200 --> 3:22:23.520]  receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the federal
[3:22:23.520 --> 3:22:28.640]  reserve system in the year 2000 debt growth collapsed to only four point five percent

[3:23:51.200 --> 3:23:57.280]  three on the web e-foods direct dot com that's eight hundred four zero nine five six three three
[3:23:57.280 --> 3:24:12.800]  on the web e-foods direct dot com chief we got cut off by the bracket and you're good for the
[3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:19.520]  rest of the hour right yes yes okay good um you were continuing with the uh visibility
[3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:26.960]  of the police to to to make them the return effect yeah so tell us more about that so anyway
[3:24:26.960 --> 3:24:31.920]  you know what by by having that code three response reduces our response times and stills a sense of
[3:24:31.920 --> 3:24:37.120]  urgency in our police officers and i think it diminishes the uh the uh comfort level for the
[3:24:37.120 --> 3:24:42.560]  crooks and so we had a guy's like i said robbing a a pizza place our guys are going to another
[3:24:42.560 --> 3:24:47.920]  priority one call they hear the sirens they split don't even take any money don't hurt anybody
[3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:52.800]  and uh so we were able to thwart a robbery just by changing our response protocol
[3:24:53.760 --> 3:24:58.880]  this is a good thing well i actually don't speed that much but it actually has helped me a few
[3:24:58.880 --> 3:25:03.040]  times you know seeing the black and white but i've noticed what the police are doing especially
[3:25:03.040 --> 3:25:07.040]  because you got to raise revenue because the economy's down uh is that the police always
[3:25:07.040 --> 3:25:12.480]  wait at the bottom of highway hills and so i've got to put my car always on cruise control now
[3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:18.160]  which then becomes a problem i remember to slow down uh because if i don't i'm going 60 on say
[3:25:18.160 --> 3:25:23.120]  capitol texas and there they are waiting at the bottom and i look and i'm going 67 and i've got a
[3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:27.680]  i mean literally the last few tickets i got like i said i went about a year ago was this i mean i'm
[3:25:27.680 --> 3:25:32.000]  not uh and used to the cops wouldn't give you a ticket if you're going five six miles over now
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:36.640]  they're doing it and i don't think that's fair when they're waiting on a hill hoping you speed up
[3:25:36.640 --> 3:25:42.480]  down the hill yeah well actually well our power enforcement team usually looks at crash crash
[3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:46.880]  data and when they decide where to prioritize their patrol uh i'd have to look at what hill
[3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:50.480]  you're talking about specifically to see what the crash data is you know they're always the bottom of
[3:25:50.480 --> 3:25:56.720]  hills huh but traditionally depending on on how how deep of a hill it is crashes are usually occur
[3:25:56.720 --> 3:26:03.040]  more because of that reason people us drive a very fast going down the hill and then going uphill
[3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:08.240]  what happens slow down uh well no the you have people end up getting fatality crashes because
[3:26:08.240 --> 3:26:12.640]  they're in and out traffic the ones are in a hurry and what'll happen is you have the big rigs the
[3:26:12.640 --> 3:26:17.280]  big trucks that can't really go fast up the hill and a car will change lanes and here comes this guy
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:21.840]  and all of a sudden we're ruined and be decapitated by driving like maniacs well since i had children
[3:26:21.840 --> 3:26:25.360]  i haven't even had a fender bender because once you have children they're with you and you really
[3:26:25.360 --> 3:26:29.840]  start thinking about driving better and and i see these people that zoom around me for no reason
[3:26:29.840 --> 3:26:33.920]  even when i'm in the slow lane and now i get mad at them i'm like the old man he used to stand out
[3:26:33.920 --> 3:26:38.320]  there yelling at me in high school i'd speak to the neighborhood because now i'm that old man yeah
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:43.120]  well you see and the problem is in our country that we lose every two and a half years the equivalent
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:50.800]  of the number of troops that died in vietnam over 10 years on our highways 58 000 and 50 percent of
[3:26:50.800 --> 3:26:56.960]  those on a national level nearly half are drunk driving related which is why i'm really aggressive
[3:26:56.960 --> 3:27:00.640]  when it comes to well chief but i mean if you want to stop the drunks yeah this is what i don't like
[3:27:00.640 --> 3:27:04.560]  a lot of nights i work till midnight up here i'm working on a film right now about obama
[3:27:04.560 --> 3:27:08.480]  i left at midnight and that's when the cops are out looking for drunks and i get on my tail
[3:27:08.480 --> 3:27:14.240]  other people's tails and i'm driving home and why run checkpoints why why take blood you can see
[3:27:14.240 --> 3:27:18.800]  drunks every drive not every night driving home i see drunks they drive real slow or they drive
[3:27:18.800 --> 3:27:23.120]  fast or they speed up and slow down and they're drifting around and i see drunks every night
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:26.880]  i mean how could the police not catch them well no we do catch them the problem is and catch them
[3:27:26.880 --> 3:27:31.920]  the problem is the second part of that is we need to uh get the evidence to be able to hold them
[3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:36.560]  accountable for two reasons one we want to get the conviction not because we want to punish these
[3:27:36.560 --> 3:27:41.040]  folks but because we want through that conviction comes requirements to go to to some educational
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:45.200]  programs but that sets the precedent when you're out there with with with injectors
[3:27:45.200 --> 3:27:48.720]  sucking blood on the side of the road i mean i mean if this is not on the side of this is
[3:27:48.720 --> 3:27:54.480]  constitutional yeah why wasn't it done before uh because it's a matter of not people not
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:27:57.840]  exercising some leadership let me let me just say that isn't a legal warrant because they're
[3:27:57.840 --> 3:28:02.960]  these rubber stamp warrants i haven't been well we talked about that well here's the issue if if
[3:28:02.960 --> 3:28:06.800]  if our officers have to prepare what's called a probable cause declaration you know that in our
[3:28:06.800 --> 3:28:11.280]  city our police officers have video cameras in the car where the where the stop is taped and the
[3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:17.280]  actions of the suspect is on cap capture on tape if our officers describe behavior and and that
[3:28:17.280 --> 3:28:22.080]  probable cause declaration and your attorney or you yourself as an intelligent person reviews
[3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:26.480]  the probable cause declaration and it does not match up with what they presented to the court
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:30.720]  then you can follow what's called a motion to suppress that out of the supreme court just
[3:28:30.720 --> 3:28:36.400]  ruled as you know last week i have it here in the stack that the most that the motion to suppress
[3:28:36.400 --> 3:28:42.320]  isn't good anymore and the police can even be wrong it doesn't say uh by accident on purpose
[3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:46.720]  and still that case won't be thrown out i i i'm familiar with that right in the paper the other
[3:28:46.720 --> 3:28:52.400]  day but i think when there's a male when there's a intentional malicious there's a difference between
[3:28:52.400 --> 3:28:58.480]  a mistake and falsely preparing a probable cause declaration or annoyingly provide first of all
[3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:03.840]  it's a crime if i if i say you if i describe behavior there's not an attorney generals don't go
[3:29:03.840 --> 3:29:09.280]  after cops for that well we do get cops convicted every once in a while every day i read about police
[3:29:09.280 --> 3:29:13.040]  caught planting drugs on people well i can tell you how does it happen since i've been here and
[3:29:13.040 --> 3:29:17.680]  we catch somebody planting drugs you i think you know how i feel about accountability we will hold
[3:29:17.680 --> 3:29:21.600]  our people accountable because the majority of my cops are excellent hardworking professors i'm not
[3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:24.480]  just saying that because you're here i've been all over the country and i want to say about the
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:29.280]  nicest police in the country are austin but i'm not saying that's too nice i mean i don't know
[3:29:29.280 --> 3:29:33.200]  i mean i yeah i mean i'll never forget a year and a half ago perry violates the federal law
[3:29:33.200 --> 3:29:38.160]  logan act he goes to bilderberg he brags about it i'm bullhorning him the austin pd walks up and

[3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:13.360]  percent of the cops he worked with were around planted drugs yeah what was this at uh west texas
[3:34:13.360 --> 3:34:18.640]  okay well that's well what about tommy chung the fed federal case had met with the marijuana
[3:34:18.640 --> 3:34:24.480]  pipes he was selling his son was that they sent an informant in to to mail the pipe to a city where
[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:29.840]  it was illegal to bust him and they still convicted him by because they've refused over and over again
[3:34:29.840 --> 3:34:34.080]  to sell the pipe to the city i mean i mean that's that's there was a stop tommy chung yeah i got
[3:34:34.080 --> 3:34:38.400]  tommy chung he spent years in prison for that i'm not familiar with you always bring up cases
[3:34:38.400 --> 3:34:43.440]  chieftain chong chieftain chong that guy oh yeah they made some good movies when i was growing up
[3:34:43.440 --> 3:34:47.920]  yeah but that's not right man yeah i'm not familiar with it you always ask me about stuff
[3:34:47.920 --> 3:34:52.800]  i'm not familiar with yeah you're not but i mean how do they have foot informants
[3:34:52.800 --> 3:34:57.520]  an informant could come in here and plant something i mean none of us are using any drugs nothing
[3:34:57.520 --> 3:35:03.520]  well i saw so they an informant got him this mail something talked to me they went and got no
[3:35:03.520 --> 3:35:09.840]  didn't talk got a job there and the city uh that had a law against it yeah there was a federal case
[3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:13.520]  doing it with the city you know they're out in california this is in ohio or whatever i think was
[3:35:13.520 --> 3:35:21.360]  ohio and they are they got somebody to get a job there at the office and then they kept catching
[3:35:21.360 --> 3:35:25.760]  them should have fired trying to mail this pipe to this city they knew it was a setup and then
[3:35:25.760 --> 3:35:30.640]  the employee who was the informant mailed the pipe and then tommy chung goes to prison for it
[3:35:31.840 --> 3:35:35.040]  well you know what i'm not familiar with that but it would seem to me that the person that
[3:35:35.040 --> 3:35:39.280]  mailed it unless there was it unless they mailed it at the direction of the of the employer
[3:35:39.280 --> 3:35:44.160]  uh may be more culpable but their overall thing was to mail everything out but the but the but
[3:35:44.160 --> 3:35:49.200]  they told them don't mail to this city this is on record yeah and then the feds rated the maker of
[3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:53.360]  the film and confiscated 10 000 of them but that only made it explode and blow up and now it's on
[3:35:53.360 --> 3:36:00.000]  showtime really yeah i have to check that out yeah i haven't seen it you know instead of me
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:04.800]  interrogating you would you like to interrogate me police chief artist i don't know how often you see
[3:36:04.800 --> 3:36:10.720]  black out first i'm kidding actually no i i gotta tell you something because people ask me hey i they
[3:36:10.720 --> 3:36:16.320]  can't believe that come on alex jones and i always tell folks i don't care how far fetched you think
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:21.120]  somebody may be and i'm not saying you are you're not i think on some issues and i won't identify
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:27.600]  him but on some issues you i probably i kind of agree with you on some of your philosophy
[3:36:27.600 --> 3:36:34.240]  uh but i really believe that uh government has to be uh responsible and responsive to people
[3:36:34.240 --> 3:36:38.880]  and you obviously have a following and that's why i'm here because if you have questions your
[3:36:39.440 --> 3:36:43.760]  viewers or listeners have questions we want to answer them especially when as they pertain

[3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:36.240]  on video goes i didn't say that now it's all on audio it's all on video we have him we have him how
[3:37:36.240 --> 3:37:40.960]  long ago was that like a year and a half ago is it my guys resisted police it was your guys it was
[3:37:40.960 --> 3:37:45.520]  year and a half ago you must have just gotten here but the point is is that then another commander
[3:37:45.520 --> 3:37:49.040]  comes up and goes we're asking you to leave and i said but you're not telling me to and then they
[3:37:49.040 --> 3:37:52.480]  and i said look i don't want to be your enemy but you can't be an enemy of the first amendment
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:57.040]  i said go ahead and arrest me but i'm gonna sue you and if you can't beat the rap uh you know
[3:37:57.040 --> 3:37:59.760]  i mean you can beat the rap which can't be the right and they understood what that meant they
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:04.720]  left me alone in the big riot police left but i mean you know yeah i'd be interested in that video
[3:38:06.320 --> 3:38:14.080]  guys pull up uh i forget the name of the video it's on youtube special we did youtube uh
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:18.880]  alex jones protesting perry cops or something that should bring it up we i mean if you got time
[3:38:18.880 --> 3:38:22.800]  after the show i'll pull it up for you yeah no actually i can do it at home i youtube you on
[3:38:22.800 --> 3:38:28.000]  a regular basis but i mean he's on video oh was he gonna get in trouble is he gonna get promoted
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:33.120]  no we don't promote problems we deal with them yeah but but but why would he come over and say
[3:38:33.120 --> 3:38:38.080]  we're gonna arrest you you know what maybe he's because i we do have an ordinance on using the
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:42.080]  amplified systems and the bull horns without a permit you have to have a permit here and they
[3:38:42.080 --> 3:38:45.760]  could have read me a ticket and then if i kept doing it arrested and then i after the ticket
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:49.520]  you'd arrest him then you'd escalate up to an arrest but he didn't say the bullhorn
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:54.480]  yeah he said this protest yeah i don't i don't think you can arrest somebody specifically
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:38:59.520]  for protesting just for the sake of protesting uh it depends on what you're doing as long as
[3:38:59.520 --> 3:39:02.720]  you don't block streets you don't want to block streets uh you want to have a hundred thousand
[3:39:02.720 --> 3:39:06.560]  people out and take over a major street you have to just because it would shut everything down
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:11.760]  well we went well i'll put this way i remember when i did the plan for the democrat national
[3:39:11.760 --> 3:39:17.840]  convention and wow in la uh back in 2000 when i was at california patrol and i remember meeting
[3:39:17.840 --> 3:39:25.200]  with uh with senator uh uh tom uh what's his name yeah i shall no no no no state senator
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:30.080]  who used to be married to uh jane fonda tom hayden and he started to ask me hey what are you gonna
[3:39:30.080 --> 3:39:33.600]  do when the naked lesbians get up on the freeway and sit down the freeway so look i'm hoping that
[3:39:33.600 --> 3:39:38.720]  you as a responsible leader will not have folks come up on our freeway and block lanes because
[3:39:38.720 --> 3:39:43.200]  i'd be concerned about people becoming angry and getting out of their cars and starting to beat them
[3:39:43.200 --> 3:39:48.960]  on the protesters as we go means for their own safety so i think that uh we have a our our special
[3:39:48.960 --> 3:39:54.800]  response unit that handles crowd control their organizational model is protect the first protect
[3:39:55.360 --> 3:40:03.920]  people's first right amendments to uh rights to uh to gather to protest but then there is the public
[3:40:03.920 --> 3:40:09.760]  safety issue then there's a person see what what the biggest problem is not people are being loud
[3:40:09.760 --> 3:40:15.360]  it's peaceful protesters to get infiltrated by a handful of you know anarchist type that next
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:18.320]  thing you know they're they're hurling they get in the middle of a peaceful crowd and they start
[3:40:18.320 --> 3:40:22.400]  throwing rocks and bottles you hear about denver where the police and the denver post got caught
[3:40:22.400 --> 3:40:28.320]  attacking their own police in a staged event no six months ago don't mind google um
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:34.480]  um google i'm gonna put up on screen for everybody right now guys google this i'm gonna get the exact
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:38.240]  headline acl looks
[3:40:41.360 --> 3:40:47.520]  at police attacking police in denver police attack police in denver and dressed up like
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:52.080]  anarchist for the news cameras to then demonize them and the other cops didn't even know that
[3:40:52.080 --> 3:40:56.640]  these were police attacking well i'd have a problem that was a case we don't we're not in the business
[3:40:56.640 --> 3:41:01.120]  of inciting riots but i mean you're aware in history that the police agencies have done that
[3:41:01.120 --> 3:41:05.360]  well i i i'll put it this way i wouldn't be surprised if something is like that has happened
[3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:09.840]  because at law enforcement there's good and bad and everything and sometimes people become misguided
[3:41:09.840 --> 3:41:14.320]  that's why it's important to have proper oversight you have to make sure we have the appropriate
[3:41:14.320 --> 3:41:18.400]  level of supervision and management to ensure that we're doing the right thing but who is commanding
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:26.240]  police in montreal canada in denver uh in in seattle to do this i i don't know i can't speak for
[3:41:26.240 --> 3:41:31.520]  other well we know who delta force that was in the seattle post intelligentser in the seattle
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:35.760]  times and speaking of that last time i brought up troops on the streets you were giggling about it
[3:41:37.520 --> 3:41:40.480]  but i know you're a newshound because you're usually in form and everything i bring up
[3:41:41.040 --> 3:41:43.760]  are you aware that the army war college north common others have announced they're going to
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:48.320]  have 20 000 combat troops to engage the american people and the army war college says that their
[3:41:48.320 --> 3:41:55.440]  new mission will be to suppress civil unrest inside the united states i'm not familiar with that now
[3:41:55.440 --> 3:42:02.320]  here is the army times no exhibit a exhibit a united states northern command u.s northern command
[3:42:02.320 --> 3:42:08.720]  gains uh dedicated response force uh and if you read they say it's for wmd's but then they add
[3:42:08.720 --> 3:42:15.920]  for civil unrest uh here's north com presents brigade homelanders regular army here's another one
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:21.760]  that's a i believe that's newsweek well here's the phoenix business journal arizona police say
[3:42:21.760 --> 3:42:26.160]  they are prepared as war college warrants military must prep for unrest imf warrants of economic
[3:42:26.160 --> 3:42:31.760]  riots yeah what what i think that uh what you're probably talking about is instances where
[3:42:32.320 --> 3:42:39.520]  the the resources of the local state and county governments are overwhelmed that there may be
[3:42:39.520 --> 3:42:45.600]  a need at some point to have uh troops assist in quelling civil unrest when i mean but i mean
[3:42:45.600 --> 3:42:52.000]  by civil unrest i'm talking about violent uh burning cities yeah i was now led during the
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:57.040]  rodney king riots and i can tell you that law enforcement response was uh pretty embarrassing
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:43:04.720]  we stood down yeah it was why did that happen lack of leadership i was extremely angry uh
[3:43:04.720 --> 3:43:10.080]  because uh when you see people starting to burn down and it's you just roll everybody that's clear
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:15.520]  you just send out an all point you know a call out for help for everybody and my philosophy is that
[3:43:15.520 --> 3:43:19.360]  you have put as many cops as soon as you can as soon as people see you taking making arrests and
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:24.000]  taking appropriate action that will have a return effect on anybody else if not the hysteria they
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:29.680]  every it just start spreading and so i mean they're not we we lost 50 american lives as i don't
[3:43:29.680 --> 3:43:32.560]  remember the exact number you know what turned the tide though a lot of it was the koreans and
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:37.040]  others up on top of their businesses you know well they they had to protect their own businesses
[3:43:37.040 --> 3:43:41.440]  and some of the locations and you know i think to me that was a very embarrassing situation for me
[3:43:41.440 --> 3:43:48.080]  because um uh we should never as police officers let it get to a point where we need to the to uh
[3:43:48.080 --> 3:43:52.960]  or we need to have somebody else coming and do our jobs we're the peacemakers in this country
[3:43:52.960 --> 3:43:58.320]  we're the peacekeepers in this country and our job is to not let organizational pride get in the way
[3:43:58.320 --> 3:44:03.200]  you know some departments may be hesitant to call other departments i'll be the first to be
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:07.600]  on the radio asking for help from other agencies here in central taxes if things start getting out
[3:44:07.600 --> 3:44:15.120]  of our hand for us oh you have the Denver post i'll put it up on screen please acou wants proven
[3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:20.960]  to police stage dc in protest dnc protest and it says right there police undercover police
[3:44:20.960 --> 3:44:27.120]  attacked other police pretended to be violent uh inflamed other protesters and officers during
[3:44:27.120 --> 3:44:33.360]  the most intense night of the four-day event so so we got there we're busy getting a rent car because
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:38.000]  we're gonna drive around our rv we drove there and we are changed lukes there and he says these
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:42.720]  guys look like cops and they're throwing things at other cops and and then i watched fox news and
[3:44:42.720 --> 3:44:47.520]  it was look at the evil anarkis protesters attacking police and i said looks like it's
[3:44:47.520 --> 3:44:53.840]  staged but we don't know i wasn't there and then it turns out it was yeah well if it turns out
[3:44:53.840 --> 3:44:57.200]  that it was i can tell you one thing that won't happen here as long as i'm a police chief i won't
[3:44:57.200 --> 3:45:01.520]  tolerate well i mean it was i mean the police admitted it is that what that said i didn't
[3:45:01.520 --> 3:45:07.200]  know no i throw it back up on screen for him right Denver post right there yeah that's what
[3:45:07.200 --> 3:45:11.280]  i love about this new tv thing we're doing well we could just put everything up and see this is
[3:45:11.280 --> 3:45:17.200]  what happened to me yeah i got on talk radio access tv in 95 and i was covering the fellow reserve
[3:45:17.200 --> 3:45:22.480]  and but i was more like a ron paul guy more mainstream version people started calling me going
[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:28.160]  when there were black helicopters south of houston they they blew up a building and i would laugh at
[3:45:28.160 --> 3:45:32.640]  them and then i started seeing in other parts of texas and i found out they would cover delta force
[3:45:32.640 --> 3:45:36.960]  would covertly lease a building and by nursing home or the middle of town then and then blow it
[3:45:36.960 --> 3:45:40.880]  up i mean i went and i ended up going to these events and buildings are on fire and there's
[3:45:40.880 --> 3:45:44.720]  trips running around and then police are coming up sing turn your cameras off and then you'd find
[3:45:44.720 --> 3:45:48.640]  out it was an urban warfare drill in the san Antonio police chief ally felipus refused to be
[3:45:48.640 --> 3:45:53.840]  paid off they brought bags of cash in i went to his office at the interview with the police chief
[3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:58.560]  and he said that when i said no they went and bribed other city officials to do an urban warfare
[3:45:58.560 --> 3:46:03.600]  drill which i had the ran corporation documents that it was to condition the public for future
[3:46:03.600 --> 3:46:09.440]  martial law and to acclimate the police and and governors to accept this now then i said okay this
[3:46:09.440 --> 3:46:14.720]  black helicopter stuff's all real i'm going to start going to these public drills with marines
[3:46:14.720 --> 3:46:19.520]  so i went to oakland and we got hebron maryland and we had police walk over with marines they
[3:46:19.520 --> 3:46:23.040]  turned her cameras off but we'd sneak around the bushes and get it and they'd have role players
[3:46:23.040 --> 3:46:26.720]  screaming i'm an american not the camp and the marines would say get ready for an execution
[3:46:26.720 --> 3:46:30.480]  they put americans down on their knees and they practice shooting us in the back of the head it's
[3:46:30.480 --> 3:46:34.560]  all on video sir okay i give you all these film talent just like i showed you the Denver post
[3:46:34.560 --> 3:46:39.920]  yeah and i went on the air and i totally changed in 1998 i said ladies and gentlemen this is insane
[3:46:40.560 --> 3:46:44.000]  and they're and because they know most the police chiefs are nice most the public are nice
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:48.720]  they're going to incrementally give us excuses incrementally and see now oh we got to have them
[3:46:48.720 --> 3:46:54.960]  for civil unrest the army yeah regular army deployed in america see see that's that's my
[3:46:54.960 --> 3:47:00.480]  awakening this is real this stuff's real people can differ on my interpretation but i've witnessed
[3:47:00.480 --> 3:47:05.440]  marines training to take our guns with people saying i'm an american police know not the camp
[3:47:05.440 --> 3:47:10.400]  and then when seeing an reported marines are training at oakland today to uh go to bosnia
[3:47:10.400 --> 3:47:16.000]  uh it wasn't bosnia they were training for america and i was there and i and we climbed
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:20.640]  through fences and we climbed around our bellies i've had i've had uh uh uh troops before to
[3:47:20.640 --> 3:47:25.920]  confiscate footage from us in santonio walk up and stick a 45 to our chest grab my camera
[3:47:25.920 --> 3:47:30.880]  got slamming down and take our camera and say you're lucky well i i i can't speak to that
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:35.120]  that ended up by them being the newspaper that's not happening here in austin because i'm the
[3:47:35.120 --> 3:47:42.160]  police chief in austin texas and my responsibilities to the people of austin and uh we uh we believe
[3:47:42.160 --> 3:47:46.080]  that we have the resources to handle our own issues and we have plenty of allied agencies
[3:47:46.080 --> 3:47:51.200]  nearest that can help us and i hope that uh we never get to the point where we have to turn over
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:57.120]  our own uh uh public safety to some other agency or some other entity well i want to say this as
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:48:01.280]  things break down when we go into this controlled depression i've been called a wimp by some people
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:06.000]  who always call for violence but they never do it themselves for for not saying go out and riot
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:12.240]  and and and go out and blast and go out and burn uh so on record i am nonviolent unless it means
[3:48:12.240 --> 3:48:15.760]  somebody's taking me and my children and putting us on army trucks yeah which they're trained for
[3:48:15.760 --> 3:48:20.080]  houston chronicle they built fema camps so up to that point i'm not going to a mount satung
[3:48:20.080 --> 3:48:25.360]  reeducation center but to that point i'm telling folks the enemy is not the police and the ground
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:30.080]  troop military and it's only going to help the global architects bring in a new world order if
[3:48:30.080 --> 3:48:36.240]  we get to that point so that's why i i i want to have this this dialogue yeah you know this this
[3:48:36.240 --> 3:48:41.200]  this this congress we're having no uh because if we don't i mean this is very real and you're
[3:48:41.200 --> 3:48:47.680]  going to see an unfold no chief just watch what i think the important thing uh in in in a democracy
[3:48:47.680 --> 3:48:52.720]  is that we have to be informed we have to be engaged and you know i always tell people you
[3:48:52.720 --> 3:48:56.640]  can sit back and uh the reason i'm a police chief is i don't like some of the things that i'd see
[3:48:56.640 --> 3:49:00.960]  girl you know going up in those police officer and you can either spend 30 years in a career
[3:49:00.960 --> 3:49:05.840]  complaining about things or you can position yourself to be a change agent and i've always
[3:49:05.840 --> 3:49:10.480]  chosen to try to increase my sphere of influence so i can make a difference so i think that the
[3:49:10.480 --> 3:49:15.920]  population that uh and your listeners that the violence is never the answer violence is uh
[3:49:15.920 --> 3:49:22.240]  should be uh the the last resort in any situation it's only be in a laugh or death situation you've
[3:49:22.240 --> 3:49:26.960]  got to engage your government you got to question your government and uh you know sometimes maybe
[3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:32.400]  you need to run for office and uh be part of the decision makers so you can weigh in on which
[3:49:32.400 --> 3:49:37.840]  direction you want your government to go in well we need good people to do that um where'd you
[3:49:37.840 --> 3:49:43.840]  learn the term change agent i don't know where i learned it but i i i consider myself a change
[3:49:43.840 --> 3:49:48.720]  agent and i i really believe that in my career i'm really proud of the fact that i've been i've
[3:49:48.720 --> 3:49:55.200]  felt that i've been an agent for positive change and positive change the nutshell is uh making sure
[3:49:55.200 --> 3:49:59.040]  that we're doing the right things for the right reasons that we treat people with respect that we
[3:49:59.680 --> 3:50:04.240]  uh respect the rights of our individuals and more importantly from a police perspective
[3:50:04.800 --> 3:50:09.840]  that we always police in a way in a manner that's consistent with the constitutional requirements
[3:50:09.840 --> 3:50:15.760]  and uh and with the law of the land well chief i notice your crew is out there standing at the
[3:50:15.760 --> 3:50:19.760]  door but you've agreed to stay to the final seven you stay there eight minutes can't you sure we've

[3:50:32.400 --> 3:50:37.520]  general support officer he's uh Dennis Ferris and uh sometimes he's with me sometimes he's not

[3:50:55.280 --> 3:50:58.560]  we're going to give out the Austin Police Department website and talk more about that in the final
[3:50:58.560 --> 3:51:03.040]  segment with the police chief Arte Salado it's great having him doctors around the world claim

[3:56:02.800 --> 3:56:07.760]  at you i appreciate you coming in my last question is this i know this it's your job to enforce the
[3:56:07.760 --> 3:56:12.640]  law yeah state of texas is ruled the state uh court has ruled that the company with the red light
[3:56:12.640 --> 3:56:18.080]  cameras in austin and texas wide is illegal they don't have the license to have it the private
[3:56:18.080 --> 3:56:22.960]  investigator license to be able to gather data there's no police officer and juris prudence
[3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:26.720]  involved to write the ticket to make the call same reason they were thrown out in san diego
[3:56:26.720 --> 3:56:31.360]  actually we write the tickets here yeah well it's still here and the news is saying and the state
[3:56:31.360 --> 3:56:35.200]  saying it's illegal why is austin saying they don't care and they're keeping them in you know i think
[3:56:35.200 --> 3:56:39.840]  that's uh the first of all police officers here review every one of those violations and we're
[3:56:39.840 --> 3:56:43.920]  the ones that issue the citations we do not leave that to the why does the state court say it's not
[3:56:43.920 --> 3:56:49.280]  right uh i think it was a local court municipal court and uh dallas and it's under review and uh i
[3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:53.200]  think that the city's i'm not a lawyer so the city's position a little different than that but i will
[3:56:53.200 --> 3:56:57.440]  tell you this one of the things that i think uh that is important is that when we put those red
[3:56:57.440 --> 3:57:03.040]  light cameras they have to be we have to position them based on on crash data and not on violation
[3:57:03.040 --> 3:57:08.880]  data because it should be about safety and not uh revenue uh so i i can't speak to the legal
[3:57:08.880 --> 3:57:13.840]  aspect of that because i'm not a lawyer but uh but i know what you i'm aware what you're so that's
[3:57:13.840 --> 3:57:17.840]  the city and the city attorneys that's their attorney yes sir yeah okay but i will tell you
[3:57:17.840 --> 3:57:22.800]  that we police officers not the vendor review those the violations and we're the ones that issue it
[3:57:22.800 --> 3:57:26.800]  to make sure that they're being issued right how do folks find out more about your particular
[3:57:26.800 --> 3:57:30.880]  offices the austin police chief or check out some of the programs you've got going they can go to
[3:57:30.880 --> 3:57:40.080]  our website www.ci.austin.tx.us backslash police uh and i one thing that i do want to say again is
[3:57:40.080 --> 3:57:45.440]  that i know that some of your listeners are really worried about my dwi blood draw and
[3:57:45.440 --> 3:57:50.960]  search warrant issues if they have questions tell them to just email me or call me uh i'd be more
