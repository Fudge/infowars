[07:12.000 --> 07:15.920]  intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to
[07:15.920 --> 07:20.880]  care for themselves we would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and
[07:20.880 --> 07:25.920]  the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue if the experience
[07:25.920 --> 07:32.000]  of the katrina disaster is evidence the breadline may have no bread just like the good intentions
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.040]  on the road to that unheavenly place the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will
[07:37.040 --> 07:42.480]  not feed us only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the

[08:56.480 --> 09:03.120]  last two years the last three the last six it is a continual climb because of devaluation of
[09:03.120 --> 09:11.200]  world currencies and you see last week george soros coming out saying gold bubble will pop
[09:11.760 --> 09:15.600]  and we know they're in there manipulating it through the central banks the question is will
[09:15.600 --> 09:23.200]  they be successful and for how long because market fundamentals are in play here and every
[09:23.200 --> 09:27.200]  economist we talk to says there's no way in the long run they're going to be able to suppress

[11:46.160 --> 11:54.080]  joke virus but the medias had headlines like 37 of america tested positive with the h1n1 yeah
[11:54.080 --> 11:57.520]  and thousands of other viruses what do you think's floating around everywhere what do you think's in

[12:48.080 --> 12:52.080]  to use hands-free most of the time but always step on it or sit on it or break it and then

[24:56.400 --> 25:01.680]  jocelyn kramer has ordered a thorough investigation of the quality of the climate reports which she
[25:01.680 --> 25:11.200]  uses to base her policies on it's all lies they said that the glaciers in the himalayan mountains
[25:11.200 --> 25:16.080]  the roof of the world were all melting and within just a decade would be completely melted
[25:17.520 --> 25:20.320]  and then now they've gone to actual universities in

[25:48.400 --> 25:54.480]  every u n report is a complete fantasy land fraud they said in the 60s we were going to
[25:54.480 --> 26:00.480]  have a complete ice age by the 80s they're playing the public because the public is
[26:00.480 --> 26:08.000]  looking at things day to day and thinks well it is hot this summer boy it's cold this winter
[26:08.000 --> 26:17.360]  must be an ice age must be a global heating i mean i've seen bill marr and just all of them
[26:18.480 --> 26:26.560]  show video of a dust storm in australia when half the country's basically a desert
[26:26.560 --> 26:31.120]  desert and he went on tv and said look at this dust storm this is like the end of the world
[26:31.600 --> 26:35.840]  this is global warming and then i already knew from reading about australia i've always been
[26:35.840 --> 26:41.760]  interested in i've never been there that the country has giant dust storms every year ever since
[26:41.760 --> 26:48.160]  they put westerners there as a penal colony to observe it and then bill marr in the same
[26:48.160 --> 26:53.040]  program and i've seen it duplicated everywhere said look at the fires in los angeles it's global
[26:53.040 --> 26:59.520]  warming no it's 10 million people in the metro area with a bunch of crazy arsonist that run
[26:59.520 --> 27:05.120]  around into the rich neighborhoods through jealousy and set fires everywhere that's what's doing it
[27:06.320 --> 27:15.120]  that area of southern california has always been high desert it's high desert there's cactuses growing
[27:15.120 --> 27:26.800]  everywhere of course if you move 10 million people into a high desert and have a bunch of
[27:26.800 --> 27:32.560]  arsonist running around and people throwing cigarettes out of their cars and campfires
[27:33.280 --> 27:36.800]  and illegal alien camps everywhere that's where a lot of the fires have been confirmed to come
[27:36.800 --> 27:42.480]  from you're gonna have fires during the hot dry time in the summer when you got 30 mile an hour
[27:42.480 --> 27:54.880]  winds or more but no it's global warming because bill marr says so but look at this comical response

[28:38.080 --> 28:44.080]  revelations and his reputation was further demolished last week when it was revealed that
[28:44.080 --> 28:49.440]  he is a total hypocrite when it comes to green credentials he thinks everyone should embrace
[28:50.160 --> 28:56.240]  for the one mile journey from his seven million dollar home to his deli office bachari doesn't
[28:56.240 --> 29:04.000]  walk cycle or use public transport or hybrid low energy vehicles he employs a driver to collect him
[29:04.000 --> 29:13.120]  for the one edit with a 1.8 liter toyota corolla dr. bachari who is ipcc chairman once told people
[29:13.120 --> 29:18.640]  to eat less meat and cut greenhouse gas emissions was driven to an upmarket restaurant popular with

[29:25.840 --> 29:32.400]  daily mail but it's bacharis involvement in what has been dubbed glacier gate that has led to calls

[33:53.840 --> 33:57.440]  don't resign you arrogant creature you know bell prize winner with al gore
[34:00.320 --> 34:05.360]  but it's pacari's involvement in what has been dubbed a glacier gate that has led to calls for
[34:05.360 --> 34:11.520]  his resignation a month joined today by greenpeace the ipcc needs to retain credibility
[34:11.520 --> 34:16.560]  see this is a desperate measure by these people is that going to happen with pacari as chairman
[34:16.560 --> 34:21.120]  i don't think so we need someone this is the head of greenpeace held in high regard
[34:21.120 --> 34:25.280]  who has extremely good judgment and is seen by the global public of someone on their side
[34:27.280 --> 34:36.000]  ipcc boss then continued with his propaganda pressure increased on pacari after it was revealed
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.240]  that the ipcc claimed that the himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035 was based on a speculative
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.680]  whim and was not backed by any formal research the notion that glaciers could melt within 25 years
[34:48.320 --> 34:53.760]  one of the reports says 10 well gore says within five the polls are going to melt has
[34:54.640 --> 35:00.240]  since been ridiculed pacari's obstinate refusal to quit under the weight of condemnation from his
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.680]  own peers is seemingly having an effect on the former railway engineers mental stability

[35:12.640 --> 35:18.320]  the financial times interview pacari says man-made global warming skeptics are quote
[35:18.880 --> 35:25.920]  people who say that asbestos is as good as talcum powder just totally made up
[35:28.640 --> 35:32.800]  expanding on the ludicrous theme pacari expressed his hope that such people
[35:32.800 --> 35:41.680]  apply it to their faces every day no we're talking about carbon dioxide bub not asbestos
[35:42.960 --> 35:46.800]  accompanying his reactionary and immature way of handling criticism his pacari's
[35:46.800 --> 35:53.760]  blind self-delusion that he has done no wrong and he went on from there this is the guy who just
[35:53.760 --> 35:59.920]  got millions of dollars with a steel mill he owns in india the british government paid who have the
[35:59.920 --> 36:05.600]  oldest and one of the largest steel mills in england shut down one of the biggest employers
[36:06.400 --> 36:13.920]  in that area and moved to india so they don't just take your jobs they pay to move them kind of like
[36:14.640 --> 36:22.160]  general motors of the 25 billion plus they got of the 50 billion dollar bailout totaled the
[36:22.160 --> 36:29.760]  automakers four didn't take it only one turning a profit they took the money and moved the factory
[36:29.760 --> 36:36.080]  to russia eastern europe china and brazil on record don't believe me just google the term
[36:37.440 --> 36:41.760]  gm uses bailout money to move to brazil
[36:44.320 --> 36:50.560]  or china or eastern europe there's a bunch of articles on that same thing here it's deindustrialization
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.840]  as the head climatologist for nasa said we want to destroy industrial society he wrote a book saying
[36:55.840 --> 37:04.160]  it published it last year if you go to a smart growth conference or you go to a un conference
[37:04.160 --> 37:07.200]  or you read the transcripts it's like a bunch of parrots and a tree
[37:09.680 --> 37:16.640]  or ducks quacking the same thing shut down industrial society shut it down shut it down
[37:16.640 --> 37:29.760]  shut it down in the third world a death sentence meanwhile 20 of the netherlands is reclaim
[37:29.760 --> 37:39.280]  c with the dykes but the un report says 50 plus percent is under sea level and will flood a
[37:39.280 --> 37:50.320]  complete line the dutch government going crazy outraged sea level blunder enrages the head
[37:50.320 --> 37:56.160]  dutch minister over the environment because they look like absolute idiots now and they
[37:56.160 --> 38:01.840]  want to salvage their takeover so when these people come into your city your state your town
[38:01.840 --> 38:06.960]  and try to circumvent the congress that won't pass this takeover and this fraudulent treaty
[38:06.960 --> 38:15.920]  remember it's illegal and based on fraud but it doesn't matter prince charles tells the press
[38:17.200 --> 38:21.120]  this is out of the express newspaper prince charles on climate change global warming
[38:21.120 --> 38:28.400]  skeptics are all liars that's a quote we're all liars we're the liars yes prince charles
[38:28.400 --> 38:33.840]  rejected mounting evidence that climate changes a myth and insisted there is overwhelming proof
[38:33.840 --> 38:41.600]  of global warming today in his first response to the furor over claims that scientists have
[38:41.600 --> 38:45.760]  covered up research casting doubt on the greenhouse effect prince charles voiced his dismay
[38:46.400 --> 38:50.560]  an alarm at those who questions the science behind climate change the heir to the throne
[38:50.560 --> 38:55.120]  raised the controversy in a speech at manchester where he launched a new initiative called start
[38:55.120 --> 38:59.920]  to provide the public with advice on how to lead more environmentally sustainable lives means paying
[38:59.920 --> 39:05.920]  more money more taxes charles the big fat parasite who has campaigned on global warming for more than
[39:05.920 --> 39:12.960]  20 years said i have watched with growing dismay and alarm the glee yes that we're not your slaves
[39:12.960 --> 39:19.200]  yes the glee with which the skeptics you mean the scientists have leapt upon the recent news stories
[39:19.200 --> 39:23.120]  that question the science know that show that it's a premeditated fraud that climate changes
[39:23.120 --> 39:33.280]  man made and suggested it's nothing more than a myth well if it is a myth this is him talking
[39:33.280 --> 39:40.560]  well if it is a myth and the global scientific community is involved in some sort of conspiracy
[39:40.560 --> 39:47.920]  why is it then that around the globe three levels are more than six inches higher than they were
[39:47.920 --> 39:59.120]  100 years ago this isn't opinion this is a fact and ladies and gentlemen i'm quoting his little
[39:59.120 --> 40:06.800]  his gives his the key the prince and ladies and gentlemen please be in no doubt the evidence of
[40:06.800 --> 40:17.600]  long term and potentially irreversible changes to our world is utterly overwhelming charles
[40:17.600 --> 40:25.840]  spoke after the arriving of the manchester by royal train pulled by a cold fired steam locomotive
[40:26.960 --> 40:31.120]  one trip of the train cost more than a million pounds
[40:31.120 --> 40:45.840]  oh charles spoke after arriving in manchester my royal train pulled by cold fired steam locomotive
[40:45.840 --> 40:53.200]  oh dreadful the plants will love the carbon dioxide that spews from the maw of the train
[40:53.200 --> 41:04.000]  pull car charles spoke after arriving in manchester by royal train pulled by a cold fired steam
[41:04.000 --> 41:15.040]  locomotive named the tornado which was built from a 1948 design he continued if the change is a myth
[41:15.040 --> 41:23.200]  why are the sea levels at more than six inches above and it continues folks i have gone and
[41:23.200 --> 41:29.440]  looked at sea level media metering rates from san francisco randomly remember a month ago on air
[41:30.000 --> 41:41.840]  i've looked at these sea levels in in other major cities and the sea level is lower than it was
[41:41.840 --> 41:47.040]  and these are meters that have been recorded every day at these ports than it was 200 years ago

[43:47.120 --> 43:54.560]  could take more than 300 years even with the fake data the body and its chairman have faced growing
[43:54.560 --> 43:59.520]  criticism ever since as questions have been raised on the credibility of their work and
[43:59.520 --> 44:06.720]  the rigor with which climate change claims are assessed and it says the government is angry

[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:17.760]  iraq obama named jane nixon to his advisory council for defense and national security issues
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:22.400]  this was made possible thanks to an executive order obama signed that was left over from
[1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:28.240]  bush administration that forms a council of governors since nixon has been a good obama
[1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:33.360]  puppet he earned some stripes in the obama administration the executive order gives the

[1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:21.360]  thank you for joining us we are now eight minutes into this second hour on this friday edition
[1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:31.280]  we've got a key article up at info wars.com titled top 10 problems with assassinating
[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:36.880]  american citizens the government says it can assassinate
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:43.200]  us citizens i remember five years ago seeing a jerusalem post article than a upi article
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:49.680]  and then a reuter story where israel said that they would kill american citizens inside the
[1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:54.880]  us and i thought that was pretty shocking if they were connected to al ciaida now our own
[1:08:54.880 --> 1:09:00.480]  government says abroad or domestically they will send in hit teams to kill whoever they want
[1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:05.920]  no judge no jury no getting sent to guantanamo bay and tortured for six seven eight years
[1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:12.240]  and then put on a kangaroo trial now they'll just kill you i want to get more into that
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:20.960]  uh coming up today and how it dovetails with this complete federal takeover of our society
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:27.760]  that's happening again obama has appointed this 10 member gubernatorial board bush started this
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:34.400]  again seamless integration with homeland security we pointed out when we were leaked the mayak report
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:40.640]  we were linked leaked a california report and a missouri report for some reason uh the uh
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:45.040]  the missouri report got all the attention then we were leaked the federal report
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:51.600]  where homeland security and north com are set up for the american people we are seen as the enemy
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:56.720]  we are the people that this is designed for because the foreign banks taking over our country
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:10:02.880]  know what they're doing is criminal and we pointed out that the earlier version of that same
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:09.760]  coded mayak report the same code number had been issued in april of 2008
[1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:17.760]  before obama even got into office so it was bush's people doing that but the neocons picked it up
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:23.520]  and spun it so this governor's council was started by bush obama expanded it with an executive order
[1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:30.240]  has now seated it to quote work with the states to counter terrorism and the governor that put
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:36.880]  out the first mayak report which is a mirror of the federal report governor nixon is the head of that
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:42.560]  subsection of the governor's council for homeland security and so we're going to be
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:48.800]  again breaking that down today we have some excellent articles from last month that detail
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:52.400]  all this but we now know who the governor's council is made up of and again we'll cover that
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:57.360]  next hour exactly who these people are obama expands federal power over the states with
[1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:04.320]  executive order curt nemo info wars dot com we have a another key report here from prison planet
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:14.960]  paul joseph watson pdd 51 a new executive order give obama dictator power last roadblocks to
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:21.600]  marshal law united states eliminated and we have the cyber security boss again resigning last year
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:27.280]  saying the pentagon is taking over the web and then we get the secret treaty that obama is saying
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:31.520]  he's going to sign with the un this is official news as of three months ago but was only in a
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:37.440]  few newspapers just massive import but the average person doesn't even know saying they do plan to
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:42.800]  ratchet down and shut down the web and make you have an id to get on the web and track everything
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:48.320]  you're doing china doesn't even make you have a web id they just filter and block most things
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:53.840]  with microsoft technology that bill gates had put in there now of course it comes out with what we
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:12:01.600]  reported five years ago with our cia source um steel mr steel we need to get him back on
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:14.880]  and in that report that came out the washington post on wednesday in fact i've got it here in my
[1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:22.160]  stack google to enlist nsa to help it ward off cyber attacks that's the spin but five years ago
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:28.000]  google moved in with nasa at a research facility they're putting in the control grids uh yahoo's
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:34.560]  involved no one is involved as much as microsoft uh in all of this as well
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:44.960]  so we need to ask the question as citizens are we going to allow ourselves to become
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:53.920]  like china are we going to let this control grid uh be put in place to take over our society that
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:13:00.240]  is a very important question to ask and we'll be discussing it coming up in the next hour
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:06.160]  right now we're joined by daemon vickers of nine points capital partners the website is
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:23.600]  www.nps again that's www.npsnpm.us for some reason i can't read that www.npm.us and of course he's a
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:31.600]  big pundit all over national television for major publications uh and uh daemon vickers is one of
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:36.800]  the very few who has successfully navigated both bull and bear markets profitably over the last
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:42.400]  25 years as clients and investment partners have invested in a who's who of some of the
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:47.520]  best performing stocks the last two decades companies like sysco system starbucks coffee
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:54.400]  and amazon.com to name a few daemon called the top of the equities market in 2000 and in 2008
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:14:01.520]  during the worst market year since 1987 one of his funds had a 63 returns uh it says daemon
[1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:08.400]  is a trend following approach allows him to embrace both up and down markets equally uh daemon uh
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:16.240]  fluid investment styles resulted in him consistently being named one of the top money managers in
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:25.760]  the country and again he's with and heads up npm.us i was having a dyslexic moment there uh daemon
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:29.600]  it's good to have you back on with us hey good to be with you as well alex good morning good
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:34.880]  afternoon everybody where do you join us from today uh we're in the uh the beautiful island of uh
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:41.840]  kawaii out near uh haina and uh uh we've got a nice house here right in the ocean and uh
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:48.720]  and uh pretty nice pretty nice day today wish i was there i've never gotten to go to hawaii i'm
[1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:53.520]  too busy here in the info bunker oh i know and i know well if you've been here about uh i get
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:59.280]  three weeks ago we could have uh hung out with the julia roberts and her kids really she just
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:04.560]  bought the house next door well here i'll name drop willy nelson invited me and he really did
[1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:09.600]  he said come out for a week and play dominoes and chess with him and woody harrelson and malwy i think
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:14.960]  that's where he said wow but unfortunately that would really cool how that would be neat
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:24.080]  yeah but uh i'd be uh permanently stoned if i did that though i'd be i'd be forced to to draw
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:30.400]  off the vaporizing hookah i know it i i could just imagine it i know it i know it yeah i was
[1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:34.080]  going to buy it probably something we should talk about today actually at some point all
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:40.320]  the effort for medical marijuana to keep everybody all doped up yeah now you know i may
[1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:44.720]  disagree with you on that because the government's pushing riddle and prozac all these really toxic
[1:15:44.720 --> 1:15:50.400]  things i know people abuse marijuana but i don't see marijuana as bad as alcohol i guess you're
[1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:56.560]  against uh marijuana decriminalization no no i i i'm not i i i don't think the government should
[1:15:56.560 --> 1:16:03.760]  should probably actively uh uh preclude anybody from doing hardly anything however as a society
[1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:09.520]  the the medication the medicating ourselves whether it be through paxel or depacote or a
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:17.120]  leaf or uh smoking powell day um it's just really the wrong direction i think not only for individuals
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:23.360]  but as a nation and it dulls the mind it dulls the senses and it does does not allow um i would
[1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:30.560]  argue that uh excessive use of um marijuana uh doesn't help a person really focus really
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:36.080]  and they're just kind of lazy and with barge it now i've seen a lot of zombie we've got a real
[1:16:36.080 --> 1:16:41.520]  problem with a non-motivation of the country as it is in most of the western nations so i think
[1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:46.880]  metal to medicating with paxel depacote or even increasingly marijuana i don't think really or
[1:16:46.880 --> 1:16:52.000]  alcohol doesn't really do anything to help us well i agree with you and i do know a lot of
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:57.520]  zombie potheds but also a lot of people that smoke it sparingly who are you know great professionals
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:01.680]  my issue is i don't want to pay to put them in prison and i know the government and big banks
[1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:06.320]  have been caught controlling the drug trade and laundering the money for a long time good i i
[1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:10.720]  definitely agree with that you know it they're putting people in prison because they drink too
[1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:18.160]  much alcohol or but or too much pot or whatever other adventures they may find themselves doing
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:21.760]  i don't think that makes any sense by the right reason that all right damon the reason we've got
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:26.480]  you on today is because you are a very successful financial trans forecaster and expert we want
[1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:31.360]  to pick your brain and we're going to go to break her and we've got a few minutes here um so i want
[1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:36.400]  to go ahead and throw this out we're seeing reports where they're talking about bankruptcy
[1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:43.840]  for the united states is now certain we've got george soros uh basically calling a plunge in gold
[1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:48.400]  last week we have central banks are going in trying to prop up the dollar drive down gold
[1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:56.560]  why we have cnbc reporting market crash if us policies uh continue uh so we have all this
[1:17:56.560 --> 1:18:02.320]  volatility stocks plunging yesterday what is causing all of this damon vickers well we've
[1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:08.720]  got a number of things going on critically you know we started this off talking about marijuana
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:13.280]  but how does that relate to the whole picture here you've got a lot of the world out the united
[1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:20.560]  states western europe greece portugal spain the uk or the death that is out there um is just uh
[1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:28.480]  ginormous and uh the ability to borrow money has delayed a lot of people pursuing jobs let alone
[1:18:28.480 --> 1:18:34.000]  the 99 weeks of unemployment that people can now get under the obama ministry so the issues right
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:39.520]  now are debts a tremendous amount of debt in the planet the lack of creation of jobs it's looking
[1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:46.880]  like uh debt in those this latest stuff downturn since 2007 we lost about eight and a half million
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:52.800]  jobs this just came out from the labor department um the unemployment rate dipped a little bit today
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:58.080]  and the numbers that came out today but it's still looking kind of dour and a lot of those
[1:18:58.080 --> 1:19:02.720]  jobs out i don't think a lot of those jobs ever kind of come back they're in industries that
[1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:08.560]  were over uh overbuilt like the construction industry like the the uh distribution of credit
[1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:12.640]  industry and the mortgage industry i don't think those jobs are coming back for a long time i don't
[1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:17.440]  know what else those people can do it has been hitting the gold market a little bit um however the
[1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:23.760]  trend for gold is still up even with this pullback i know it's hard to endure but um it is um should
[1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:28.480]  nations can talk about that or whether or not that becomes a liquidation point to raise assets
[1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:34.800]  to store value and that could happen and really it's the recovery of what so really it is about
[1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:42.000]  jobs it is about jobs in the world and productivity and making uh europeans and european nations on the
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:46.320]  planet productive people all right stay there david vickers that's going to take a change

[1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:32.480]  points capital partners okay this is a short segment getting right back to you daemon you are
[1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:38.880]  getting into why the stock market's plunging what's happening with gold where you see this economy
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:44.480]  they're already talking about another stimulus the jobless numbers are exploding we have
[1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:50.640]  pennsylvania on the verge of bankruptcy california they're now talking about rating pension funds
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:56.160]  taking people's pensions and the government managing it i mean this does not look pretty
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:02.320]  right it doesn't but i mean it comes back to it it comes back to productivity and the united
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:06.160]  states being a going concern you opened up the show the beginning is talking about well the
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:12.160]  united states bankrupt above yeah we're bankrupt the united states have bankrupt for years um i
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:17.680]  think you may draw some comfort though i suppose that it's not just us that it's also the united
[1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:24.240]  kingdom it's greece it's portugal it's spain it's a lot of western europe as well done uh the when
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:30.400]  when when we went off uh currencies actually representing anything and we fired up the printing
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:35.840]  presses we have just printed and printed and printed and printed more money and more money
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:43.680]  and more money and the planet as a whole has all bought into this game of he who has the most
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:49.360]  monopoly money wins and that's whether you're whether it's a 10 million or 50 million or 100
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:56.000]  million that we're all striving to accumulate more of these both dollars or euros or whatever it is
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:04.320]  and they represent nothing um so our values are off uh and uh you know that our relationship to
[1:26:04.320 --> 1:26:11.200]  debt has been a very huge problem and it's enabled enabled like the potpack full debt because believe
[1:26:11.200 --> 1:26:15.920]  the debt has also medicated us not unlike the way those things have medicated us
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:22.320]  and given us the false sense of prosperity and the illusion that everything is okay when things
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:28.240]  are really not okay and so you know we talk about the bankruptcy of the united states
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:34.480]  is being a bad thing uh maybe the ultimate bankruptcy of the united states is the best
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:39.600]  thing that could possibly happen and perhaps we should hasten its arrival and build from there
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:47.200]  but damon isn't the key to this though if we have a bankruptcy and the same
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:52.800]  systems are then continued after that the big central banks and the players at the top are
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:58.800]  going to get even more control in power and continue uh using the central banks to give
[1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:04.480]  themselves insider knowledge and unlimited funding well they're they're funding of what
[1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:09.040]  alec i mean they're the controlling of what we're both currencies they're playing the same game that
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:15.120]  everybody else is uh but haven't they already pre-positioned themselves with the fiat currency
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:20.880]  when it still had value to buy real assets what what value do the real assets really have if you
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:26.480]  have if you if you can't exchange this anything so let's let's say okay so you own i mean what
[1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:29.520]  would be the real asset that you would think that they would own that would have so much value
[1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:36.080]  that gives you that gives them an advantage over you what large defense contractors they take over
[1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:40.800]  the global monetary system and then they basically inflate us that that's already we're already there
[1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:48.800]  i agree i don't know what their victory is and if and if they and if they totally well they want
[1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:53.840]  the next bubble they want the carbon tax they want that i mean they've said the yes we yes we
[1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:58.000]  run you yes it's world government yes the bankers rule you and you're now going to pay us carbon
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:04.960]  taxes but that's failing yeah yeah that is that is coming cool as well well um there's a lot of
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:10.000]  debt out there that the job growth is the problem i think if you know you and i were going back and
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  forth and you know about us you know uh on jobs and and it's hard to get it's hard to get a lot of
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:21.680]  a lot of the world productive i mean it's hard to get people to be productive you know it seems
[1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:29.040]  often in most organizations that we need to put five dollars of of effort and of money
[1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:34.480]  into into a person to even get a dollar of output and i would say that that's the case of a lot of
[1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:39.840]  a lot of workers particularly in the in the united states so you're saying the planet
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:47.600]  the industrialized world is a bunch of tv watching couch potatoes yeah uh who just want
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:53.040]  everything for free and i agree it's not just the corrupt elite that have facilitated this it is the
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:58.000]  sloth like zombies that have played right into their hands and now the elite are going to use
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  the sloth zombies to rob the middle class i don't know i don't know that there's
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:09.040]  as much value there either alice most of the middle class will leverage and leverage themselves
[1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:13.920]  up to the eyeball they're pretty much wiped out the the smarter people that the people that
[1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:19.120]  have always had money they didn't go into much debt they didn't they pay cash for them i don't
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:26.720]  have any debt well there you go all of us can't be as rich as you alec i'm not that rich i i mean
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:33.440]  i try to be a good steward to run my operation but um i mean i just don't really go into debt i
[1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:38.000]  except for maybe a house and but you see that's your purse that's your personality your personality
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:43.200]  i mean what i get from you the brief time that we've known one another is that you're really
[1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:48.160]  about focusing solely and clearly at it whether they stay there let's come back and talk about
[1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:55.040]  you're going to look at them we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run

[1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:29.680]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[1:30:29.680 --> 1:30:34.880]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:39.440]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:29.520]  i'm no one to make comments about you i mean but i it seems that uh that you are someone who looks at
[1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:34.880]  things very soberly and you accept the the good news the bad news the freckles the wards or whatever
[1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:41.280]  but you don't delude yourself um which is uncommon and uh and good to see in a class or a class you're
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:47.040]  on the radio well we've got you here and we appreciate your valuable time away from your
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:52.720]  family to to really discuss where this is going because i see all these big central bankers saying
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:58.320]  we're in danger of another collapse a bigger collapse uh currencies worldwide are going down
[1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:04.640]  overall uh and and the joblessness is increasing and we keep talking about that but how do you see
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:10.080]  this unfolding i mean what preparations are you making in all of your billions and portfolios out
[1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:15.680]  there to protect your investors well one one thing we've been doing is the lightning up and recently
[1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:20.800]  we've been lightning up and and uh lessening our commitments to the market um if we roll over and
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:25.360]  we start headed down um we're going to start shorting the market and we'll start shorting we've
[1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:30.240]  got a number of issues that look like the setting up i'll be watching how they close uh today on the
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:36.160]  close on a friday um if they close week on some of them i may i may go out on the day short the
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:42.560]  number of issues um however the trend may still be up so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:47.440]  try to have too much of a bias one way or the other i mean yes i do believe that the job creation
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:52.880]  is critical to the your economic future and health and viability of the stock market the economy and
[1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:58.960]  i understand the relationship with job growth and innovation and but most of the new jobs are
[1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:03.760]  government market most of the new jobs are government a lot of the new job that's right job
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:09.120]  growth consistently there has been job growth in the government and that is the growing tumor
[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:14.160]  that we see overtaking the whole economy of bureaucracy and control and all of those things
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:21.520]  um so if we do start rolling down we will go short and yes and you know 2008 a year that was
[1:35:21.520 --> 1:35:25.840]  pretty apocalyptic we had a fund that went up 63 percent our head funds did pretty good that was
[1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:33.360]  nice and in the last bear market in that 2000 to 2003 we also um made a lot of money from those
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:38.880]  declines like i don't really have this love for bull market versus bear market i really want what
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:43.600]  the market wants and um actually in bear markets we make more money than bull market because the
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:50.000]  markets fall faster than they rise because of fear um uh what it will inevitably mean is that we're
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:54.320]  the the holder of all these assets we'll have to see uh the gold you know people are looking at
[1:35:54.320 --> 1:35:58.400]  for a safe haven and gold it's an area that we've been involved in like i think you really have to
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:03.280]  watch that roughly thousand dollar level um for gold but i think it's very probable that we are
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:08.320]  going to hit it um and it doesn't matter whether we hit it the question is whether or not we really
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:14.320]  break through it broke through it but it's it's not uncommon when you break out which is what gold
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:19.920]  did when it broke through it's out and then ran up to 1225 an ounce i think intraday to come back
[1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:27.440]  and test or cap on the other side it happens when we're all the time um so i think really probably
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:33.200]  for those investors that don't own gold already um that as we pull back on top of this thousand
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:37.840]  dollars that that may be an area that you may want to speak to to get involved if you haven't
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:42.480]  already gotten involved okay and that would be a place where you kind of monitor your position
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:48.240]  but ultimately if the you know what it's the fan you probably wouldn't wouldn't be a bad idea to
[1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:54.000]  own some gold but you need to do it well and to own it well and also be prepared to let it go too
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:58.720]  after if you're proven wrong you're gonna have to pull the plug you don't want to be owning it
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:03.520]  as it breaks through a thousand nine hundred eight hundred seven hundred and you're losing money
[1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:08.640]  but you still have your belief but you're losing money so you've got to be you've got to be uh uh
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:13.600]  i would i would say to take a shot at it but also be willing to uh to uh to take it off
[1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:20.160]  all right shifting gears in a big way i wouldn't call you a globalist a new world order person
[1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:25.760]  but you do run in those circles you are one of the people who will be honest on the air and
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:32.160]  admit it's a world government a new world order but i see their swine flu hoax imploding as a hoax
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:37.200]  admittedly a hoax now the EU admits it's a hoax we had the head of that commission on just a few
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:46.160]  days ago uh wolf king uh woe dark uh we have their carbon tax hoax literally imploding on every front
[1:37:46.160 --> 1:37:53.040]  new scandals dwarfing climate gate on a daily basis uh we have the big central banks in trouble
[1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:58.960]  caught giving themselves the bailout money that's falling apart we have the globalization
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:05.680]  and big government being ridiculed at every level uh so what do you see the elite doing
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:11.600]  because you're right to say we're already in a banking dictatorship our our congress has admitted
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:16.560]  you know many congressmen and women that the big banks run the country but as the real power
[1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:22.640]  structure is identified more and more uh just historically and trending forward into the future
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:28.880]  uh what if if you were you know one of the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers one of these big
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:33.680]  controllers what would you be doing or what are you hearing their planning to do
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:41.680]  i i i don't know i mean there's there you've got i i don't know i don't hear that they're
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:46.080]  planning i don't hear that i don't hear plans like you mentioned about the the swine flu and
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:50.320]  yeah i mean that's uh late last i heard was that they were getting they wanted to do injections
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:59.200]  for second target um i you know i don't know my my my sense is is that is that the population is
[1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:07.600]  the global population issue is that is a real problem and uh my sense is that uh we probably
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:13.840]  need some limits on that so that that may be an area that there's some involvement in um
[1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:18.400]  there you go see i was going to do a friendly economic interview because you can bring us a
[1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:22.960]  lot to the table and uh you know i don't think you're a bad guy i mean you but you really
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:30.960]  you bring up the big hot button uh issue yourself you're saying the globalists are involved
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:38.320]  in population reduction if i take what you say correctly correct me if i'm wrong and that it is
[1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:44.640]  a problem for the economy i mean we've aborted 50 million of our workforce in the last 35 years in
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:53.280]  the u.s so we brought in 50 million foreigners i mean we brought in the 50 million farmers at
[1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:58.320]  barters alex because we were unwilling to do the work that they're so willing to do we see we
[1:39:58.320 --> 1:40:04.000]  don't want to actually work you see the hard the hard focusing and the hard the willing to
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:08.960]  soberly look at issues and see things squarely as they are that's the work that you do that's
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:15.680]  the work that i do but for for most americans they're too busy taking pacts all depacote uh the
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:21.520]  agra adpo and smoking powder all day and and medicating themselves with debt to look at what
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:25.680]  the real issues and they only care about the superbowl at home depot and they get the mexican
[1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:30.800]  so they or they have Italian restaurants mexicans because the americans are too good to do any work
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:36.000]  we're too good for that we're too good to work hard apparently well there is something to what
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:40.640]  you say but i see a lot of really hardworking americans who aren't the lazy americans who are
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:44.640]  caught in the middle pandering you're pandering through your audience alex no i mean i know a
[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:50.560]  lot of people working two three jobs uh not well yeah they're working two or three jobs
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:54.880]  because they they've fasted put together a lifestyle that's unsupportable with mortgage
[1:40:54.880 --> 1:40:59.600]  payments they're too high because and now they're trying to support something that's unsupportable
[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:05.840]  on the united states system as it is is unsupportable and there is not enough debt in the world
[1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:14.080]  to keep this beef rolling um as for the population the population issue um yes the pop the global
[1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:18.960]  population probably does need some regulation the truth is we should be regulating ourselves
[1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:27.040]  it is it is not it is not right for people for men to quote unquote procreate and produce
[1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:32.080]  15 to 28 children like they do in a yeah but the average births about four children in the world
[1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:37.120]  but but damon you again i want to get you on let's see let's see the population issues we've
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:45.120]  got we've got the agriculture issues we've got health issues um and um somebody in some
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:52.800]  central has to have to exert some degree of control for a world that is basically in chaos
[1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:58.320]  and on the verge of collapse because of our delusion well we'll see damon here we are
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:05.520]  are because we've had two rambunctious interviews with each other um you know the first interview
[1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:09.440]  i wasn't too hard on you we just basically argued with each other the last interview
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:14.160]  and i've got you here because i really want to understand the establishment view and i think
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:17.920]  it's safe to say you're a member of the establishment i mean how much money does has your
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:22.160]  fund managed over the years yeah that's private information but but it's a lot
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:29.440]  it's probably a couple of dollars yeah the point is the point is is that you do run in these
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:37.040]  circles and every time i am around someone of your caliber it is the same thing whether it's at a
[1:42:37.040 --> 1:42:43.680]  cocktail party or at the state house or anywhere it's the same story they come over and they say
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:48.000]  alex there are too many people whether you like it or not they're a bunch of lazy slobs
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:54.240]  there's a disdain for the public and and and and no i i i don't have a disdain for the public i
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:43:03.040]  have a disdain for the mindset of most people we need a you know we need a a a rebirth a renewal
[1:43:03.040 --> 1:43:09.200]  an evolution real and forget about a renewal we need a we need to evolve okay mentally we the
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:15.200]  whole world needs to like like click into gear and begin to perceive things differently than
[1:43:15.200 --> 1:43:21.120]  they currently all right well let me say this and then get your take look i have disdain for people
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:26.320]  who are in debt and who their kids are on drugs and can't read and write and that's a lot of yuppies
[1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:34.000]  not just poor people who worship the super bowl and buy lottery tickets and but but but i know a
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:38.800]  lot of good people do alex you do the okay you have this okay good good that's brave going after the
[1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:44.560]  fourth the fourth fourth book good for you okay i'll go with that i disdain i think we should have
[1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:49.920]  compassion for them because they're in they're in place but i mean let me finish the statement
[1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:55.600]  but just because people are like children the media the culture has been geared for that
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:44:01.040]  and i see the cps i see the government i see the secret homeland security reports
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:08.080]  where their main enemy is the hardworking rural and local business person and the producers
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:15.520]  and so i do see red-blooded middle america who are keeping this country afloat being fed on by the
[1:44:15.520 --> 1:44:22.160]  elites and by the slob general public now that's a different view i think than your overall view
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:25.680]  though because when i said there are a lot of really hardworking good people out there you
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:29.120]  just said oh come on you're pandering i mean what are you getting at no they're really here you
[1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:34.800]  here went well no because that went when you start talking about america you'll i mean i do a lot of
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:39.440]  interviews and what you'll what you'll what when i start talking like that then what the what the
[1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:44.320]  host will usually do is start defending his audience which is the general public and do that one
[1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:48.640]  look you've got you do have people out there that are produced you do have people that are
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:52.960]  hardworking okay i mean i'm on vacation right now but i'm doing this interview i mean i'm looking
[1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:56.720]  at the ocean i could be out in the beach right now but i'm still working i'm still working with you
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:01.920]  okay so there are people out there not that it's me but there are people out there that are hard
[1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:06.640]  working here's the problem the problem is is that there's fewer and fewer of them
[1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:12.880]  and that and that you've got less and less quote producer you're a producer i'm a producer there
[1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:16.640]  are people that do run good distance out there and do run good priorities and look at apple
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:22.720]  computer they've i think they're doing a great job innovative good technology um beating the
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:28.160]  pants off of microsoft and microsoft is sub-basement compared to some of the stuff that apple's doing
[1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:34.640]  i mean obviously um but there's fewer and fewer of them and at the same time government is getting
[1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:40.960]  bigger and bigger and bigger and the government is exerting more and more as you the control
[1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:46.800]  and wanting to take more and more from the producer to a point that it that it's almost
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:52.880]  that you're almost disincentivized to do any production whatsoever exactly and when i look
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:59.440]  at the ultra elites and their policy reports and what they're doing they're taking our normal uh bad
[1:45:59.440 --> 1:46:06.320]  traits and and and force feeding them like a cancer uh they want us lovingly they want us dependent
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:11.920]  they want us weak and so that's my issue i mean you're somebody with with kind of an elitist
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:16.720]  or what you call a reality-based perspective i don't know i kind of reject that alex i mean
[1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:21.840]  i i i i don't really get that i mean if you're talking about any any of these people i think
[1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:29.600]  there's there's there's a desire i think to to to uh to positively influence global change
[1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:36.320]  and when we saw pictures in recent weeks of Haiti our initial response from the Haiti issue is
[1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:41.280]  you know oh my god look at the poor suffering Haiti people Haiti has been suffering for decades
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:47.840]  their population has grown 50 percent in the last decade they're pushing 10 million they eat mud pies
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:54.320]  on the street uh soon they'll be pushing 15 million and 20 million and if we push it far enough out
[1:46:54.320 --> 1:47:01.360]  and the Haitians are going to be eating each other um and so it's not just Haiti Haiti is Haiti
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:06.720]  could potentially be a lot of what the world looks like the united states does not feed itself
[1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:13.360]  we did we were net importers of food like Haiti the united states does not fuel itself we are
[1:47:13.360 --> 1:47:21.520]  net importers of fuel well argentina is a good parallel to the us okay okay well um i you know
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:27.520]  we need to be we need to be self-supporting and self-sustaining and have and have uh structures of
[1:47:27.520 --> 1:47:32.000]  of but that's the issue when you read what the globalists say they point out a lot of things
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:36.160]  you're pointing out but then all their policies are to make us more dependent
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:42.960]  well i i i don't know i don't know where i see that i i think people i think most people probably
[1:47:42.960 --> 1:47:47.520]  would like to be dependent most people are followers they're not leaders any any way you
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:52.000]  shape it out 80 percent of the people are going to do next to nothing 20 percent of the people are
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:57.520]  going to do most of the the production in any in any economy and most people don't think for themselves
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:03.360]  and most people just generally are too lazy to think for themselves well bottom line where do you
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:09.120]  see the world in 10 years i mean it it it doesn't look good any way you slice it well the debt
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:14.000]  issue the debt issue is the debt issue is the real problem the lack of productivity is the
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:18.960]  real problem our focus is that is the real problem you know we need to put money in
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:23.840]  we need to overhaul the educational system i mean radically like right away this is something
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:30.480]  obama needs to be doing we need to slow down reverse the growth of government not only in
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:35.120]  the united states but also in the western nation well that's not happening instead they're going
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:39.920]  the opposite direction we're definitely so so where are we going then with these guys piloting
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:47.040]  things um well i mean i don't i would i i i if you're saying they're piloting things i think
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:53.520]  it's also the general population we we we we're going to need probably some type of a collapse
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:59.520]  i would say to bring about global change because people don't really think we need any evolution
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:05.920]  of people's minds we need people's minds to evolve and to change what their priorities are
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:12.880]  and then so the right crisis will bring in the new world order daemon uh... a a a uh...
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:18.640]  yes i would say it all likely that a crisis probably would bring in a new world order
[1:49:18.640 --> 1:49:23.280]  i would hope that that new world order is a change for the good because clearly what we
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:29.040]  have in place right now is not working none of it is working if the systems are not working
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:34.960]  globally so you may need to disintegration of the present system before you build a new one
[1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:39.920]  but this was a new world order globalization has accelerated all the problems
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:46.880]  well you don't go you don't go back i mean we're not i mean we're not globalization is not going
[1:49:46.880 --> 1:49:52.720]  to go back maybe inevitably the the place that we get to is that we really are one world that we
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:59.200]  that nations do become more like date and we do have but every every week what we what we dissolved
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:04.560]  is the need to war with one another why are the globalist why are the globalist overrunning europe
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:11.360]  and north america with the third world populations i mean they could clearly control that but they're
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:18.960]  not they they want to overrun because then those populations will vote to rob and fully enslave
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:25.200]  the final producers you know i don't i don't know about that i mean i why why is the third world
[1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:31.360]  running towards the the the western world they do it because of job you know they Mexico comes to
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:37.280]  the united states so that they can export money back to their to them to mexico and to columbia
[1:50:37.280 --> 1:50:42.640]  whatever else the people migrate from the the chinese cancel and to shanghai so they can send
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:48.880]  money back to their agrarian but the third world so absolutely horrible if it's so i don't believe
[1:50:48.880 --> 1:50:54.960]  that's orchestrated by any the conspiring world power hell the illegal aliens are above the law
[1:50:54.960 --> 1:51:00.160]  where i live they don't even have to have driver's license they they can drop drive i mean the system
[1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:05.040]  gives them a red carpet hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:10.000]  storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:14.560]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:18.320]  that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:23.120]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[1:51:23.120 --> 1:51:29.760]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:34.240]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically

[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:40.080]  well i mean there's no doubt the currencies are going down worldwide there's no doubt
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:48.240]  that we're going into a worldwide sustained depression that there is no doubt that government
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:57.760]  is just pressing the accelerator of growth and so again i go back of their growth of their growth
[1:54:57.760 --> 1:55:02.880]  so so where where is it going i mean what will a dollar collapse look like or how do you how do
[1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:08.320]  you see this whole currency situation shaking out yeah well it's not happening right now i
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:12.880]  mean because what you're seeing is uh you know portugal we've had problems with portugal i think
[1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:18.880]  the the last the last i heard was to to ensure ten million dollars of their debt because they tried
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:24.480]  to sell some debt this last week the the price to ensure that ten million was two hundred and
[1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:31.520]  nineteen thousand dollars just to ensure the debt that's pretty rich um so um what's happening is
[1:55:31.520 --> 1:55:37.440]  it's because western europe portugal greece spain uk because these places are are are really coming
[1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:44.880]  on glute first you're seeing a flight to a flight to quality if they're if the u.s dollar is such a
[1:55:44.880 --> 1:55:50.080]  thing uh you know but you gotta imagine a ship is sinking right and the rats will climb to higher
[1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:54.960]  decks on the ship and so it is with market so that we have the the currency thing is in fact
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:56:01.120]  unfolding on a global basis but we're getting this temporary lift in dollars because global
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:07.200]  investors and global you know holders of currencies don't know where quite to put their money so we've
[1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:13.760]  seen this lift in uh the u.s dollar the week so when does the ship go down when does the ship go down
[1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:20.480]  i think that i i think it uh i'm not sure when it happened i i can tell you that when it does
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:25.120]  happen though it'll happen pretty quick it'll happen like an overnight what is the crow's nest
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:30.800]  that will have hundreds of rats piled on it as it goes down into the north atlantic but what a
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:35.600]  great imagery out the crow's nest what are you talking about what do you mean crow's nest
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:40.800]  well but you know that's the area up on the main mast where the lookout and it's the last part of
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:47.440]  the ship to go under so you've got rats uh famous historians wrote about ships going under and rats
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:54.800]  going up and and and perching on the you know top of the mast as it goes under it's it's probably hard
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:57:03.200]  access inevitably which so gold real estate uh things like that real estate inflated it wouldn't
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:07.920]  be real estate because real estate is inflated by all the excess dollars but at least it's something
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:13.040]  that's got something real is what i meant no no but it but it and never unless it's farmland or
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:18.000]  something like that and and and really there won't be much demand for that no real estate is
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:22.800]  going to be going down for years so what is it gold i mean gold period what else what else is hard
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:29.200]  you know i just like i i guess just commodities but even if it if it really really got bad
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:35.280]  it you have to temper the rise in gold with the fact that some people some some holders would
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:41.280]  be selling gold because they would have nothing else to sell right if your currency is worth nothing
[1:57:41.280 --> 1:57:45.760]  so you have a depression in the real economy so it doesn't matter if you're the crow's nest
[1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:52.320]  because you're still going under yeah i think they're in a in a in an all out total global collapse
[1:57:52.320 --> 1:57:59.360]  that inflationary inflationary collapse um they're likely would be few places to hide and we've had
[1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:04.400]  we've we've for years and decades they've said that what you needed to be would be in stock
[1:58:04.400 --> 1:58:09.840]  because the box kept going with inflation you we've had the currency go down what 97 percent
[1:58:09.840 --> 1:58:14.480]  over the last 30 40 years and yet the stock market has gone up so it's kind of a delusion
[1:58:14.480 --> 1:58:19.600]  really that the people are facing um look whatever the trends are we're going to follow them whether
[1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:23.360]  the trend for the market is up for the trend for the markets are down we're going to keep
[1:58:23.360 --> 1:58:28.480]  the capitalized on them if the markets continue to roll over we will increasingly get it get
[1:58:28.480 --> 1:58:34.480]  short like we did in 2008 like for the general public you you see even more storms ahead
[1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:39.920]  i think the the underlying trends are are pretty strong and you got to really be alert and uh
[1:58:39.920 --> 1:58:49.040]  keep working that you hold on you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[1:58:51.280 --> 1:58:55.840]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:58:55.840 --> 1:59:00.160]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:59:00.160 --> 1:59:05.200]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:59:05.200 --> 1:59:10.800]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:15.920]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:59:15.920 --> 1:59:21.200]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[1:59:21.200 --> 1:59:25.840]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:59:25.840 --> 1:59:31.200]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:35.680]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:41.520]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's

[1:59:47.680 --> 2:00:03.600]  1-877-327-0365 waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:06.160 --> 2:00:13.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:22.400]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:28.480]  we've been getting a very interesting perspective in the last 45 minutes from daemon vickers
[2:00:28.480 --> 2:00:38.960]  nine points capital partners director the website is www.npm.usarsightsinfowars.com
[2:00:38.960 --> 2:00:45.680]  bob Chapman on a host of issues of the international forecaster.com coming up in the next segment again
[2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:49.600]  i'm alex jones daemon your gracious enough to stabilize a few more minutes so you can finish
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:55.360]  your thought uh there you you were talking about other currencies going down and that's what dr
[2:00:55.360 --> 2:00:59.520]  paul craig roberts three months ago predicted bob Chapman many others we've had on are saying the
[2:00:59.520 --> 2:01:04.480]  same thing that you've been talking about that as other currencies go down because they're even in
[2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:09.520]  more debt with big government than we are that rats are going up to higher levels of the ship
[2:01:09.520 --> 2:01:14.960]  and they're now on the deck which is the united states and so that's buoying the dollar for a
[2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:20.880]  time uh but the government's only pressing the accelerator for more government more spending
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:25.920]  more bailouts so again how do you see the ship going under because they're clearly not going
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:32.080]  to write the ship i i i don't think so i mean i don't you if we if we're assuming that government
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:37.600]  is going to have this like a epiphany of understanding what it is that actually creates jobs and
[2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:42.000]  innovation and all that that's not going to come from government like you know i'd like to see
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:48.960]  better tax policies in place that might really help us but on really we we need to uh we need to
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:54.880]  encourage innovation and technological leadership and that's it and i mean really push really really
[2:01:54.880 --> 2:02:02.480]  really push for it um that's our only way out we have to export things um and so um but and i
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:07.680]  want to go back to the currency what happens in markets in any market and for anybody who remembers
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:13.840]  you know the decline in 2008 or the decline that we had in 2000 and 2003 that what happens is that
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:19.920]  fewer and fewer stocks are going up and what happens is that people pile into quote the
[2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:25.600]  quality issues and so what you get is you get the very narrow uh support in the market where
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:30.880]  most issues are going down a couple are kind of maintaining their their their ground and then
[2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:35.200]  that makes more bubbles no no no i have nothing to do with bubbles and probably in an all out
[2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:41.120]  decline inevitably in an all out decline everything goes down got it on so is that the the the
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:47.120]  delusion that investors are have right now of selling their their Greek currency and maybe
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:53.680]  that the pounds and the euros and going into dollars is really short sighted inevitably
[2:02:53.680 --> 2:02:58.160]  inevitably they'll be telling dollars to the dollar will go down as well well i was thinking
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:06.080]  mainly of uh commodities being bubbles because if they're the best thing out there then finally
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:10.560]  when people have to dump them because that's the only value there is to pay for things i mean that
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:17.440]  does pop a bubble uh well the commodities that is an interesting one because the the global commodities
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:25.360]  like all asset prices have been driven off because of the excess supply of currency that's in the
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:30.560]  planet current the printing of currency it's not just us it has this all out of banded and
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:34.640]  loved the printing press it's all of these countries that we're talking about it the
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:40.960]  greek is the portugal what do you think the export is of greek what is it it was a olive oil
[2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:45.360]  or what is it what are they i was about to say olives and what you write all of you know but
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:51.440]  you know it's big yeah you know what are they i get out of this pain so we have this g20 coordinated
[2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:58.640]  printing press like an arms race but of money and so we got one minute left what does it lead to
[2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:04.560]  it i inevitably i think what i would at all inevitably people lose faith and currencies
[2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:11.680]  that in an entire in in in their entirety and you get some type of uh probably new monetary form
[2:04:11.680 --> 2:04:18.400]  of exchange yes because it's electronic because we're in the digital age it's electronic and um
[2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:25.760]  and we're it's more something like that a global government a global government a new global
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:31.120]  system of debit and credit that are all managed electronically on a global basis but they plan
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:36.560]  that to be carbon based but that's failing well we'll see if they're able to bring that one back
[2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:40.800]  to life all the best out scraping with you damon thank you for being with us take care

[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:52.160]  that that are interested thank you so much okay i want to get into the economy first because
[2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:57.120]  for two years they've been telling us that the economy is getting better they were telling us
[2:11:57.120 --> 2:12:02.080]  that really four years ago and so i want bob Chapman who's really the leading expert we have on of
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:09.200]  so many economists brokers researchers trends forecasters uh dr paul craig roberts three
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:13.520]  months ago two and a half months ago said that when the carry trade reversed to the u s that
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:19.600]  other currencies were imploding so bad that for a while the dollar would go back up and gold would
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:24.880]  probably go down but then race up later and we saw it go down race back up now go down somewhat
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:32.320]  uh but as damon vickers said earlier all that's left at the end of the day is gold and silver
[2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:37.120]  and he doesn't sell gold and silver he's telling you that though uh because that's all that has
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:43.200]  any real value and so you have a depression in the real economy while the banks fill themselves
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:49.920]  and their fat bellies full of trillions of dollars uh you have government worldwide ballooning in size
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:53.040]  because it's the mechanism for taking the public's wealth and giving it to the elite
[2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:58.080]  and giving some chicken feed to the unwashed masses to control them and so much is going on
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:05.600]  stock market plunging while the dollar goes up uh you've got pennsylvania and other states california
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:11.200]  saying they're going into bankruptcy now you've got states and cities passing taxes on food
[2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:17.360]  baby food milk i mean talk about draconian they're going to squeeze and squeeze is there a method
[2:13:17.360 --> 2:13:21.680]  to this madness and where is it all going bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot
[2:13:21.680 --> 2:13:29.760]  com thanks for joining us well thank you and uh it's uh very nice to be back and uh i only wish
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:38.400]  that we had uh yourself and jesse and others like you in the early 1960s it wouldn't have been such
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:46.960]  a hard 50 years but with that said um we've crossed a great river here and that is we're
[2:13:46.960 --> 2:13:52.240]  really delivering the message and and we're really getting out there and we're really driving the
[2:13:53.040 --> 2:13:59.600]  aluminum is crazy and uh they're on the run as we've discussed before as far as the economy's
[2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:07.200]  concern uh sources told me this morning that they expect that the administration's going to look for
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:13.680]  150 billion dollars as another stimulus program nothing like the almost 800 billion that they
[2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:19.760]  had before but you got to remember they're going to out of the budget double the amount of money
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:27.040]  that is spent on education uh they're going to in some way create jobs by using credits
[2:14:27.840 --> 2:14:34.800]  and tax thing and just interrupt bob you said in october of 2008 there would be a second stimulus
[2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:41.440]  in 2010 when they were swearing there wouldn't be how did you know that i knew that because
[2:14:41.440 --> 2:14:49.200]  because they really should have not done 800 billion they really needed about 1.5 trillion
[2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:57.440]  and as it's happened uh they didn't have enough and they need more and what they did get
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:05.440]  obliquely was a hand through the corner to any quantitative easing program the 27 23.7 trillion
[2:15:05.440 --> 2:15:16.080]  dollars but even that hasn't been enough and so uh they're going to spend 100 billion quote
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:22.800]  creating jobs of course it'll be short term it won't work and uh they're going to give states
[2:15:22.800 --> 2:15:28.400]  loans of 25 billion to keep them from going bankrupt and so if you're at it all up it comes
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:33.120]  close to uh 500 billion dollars and that's what i figured they might be able to get away with
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:37.520]  and that's what they've gotten that will carry them probably into the election and that's it
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:45.600]  and then everything will sputter and go down again you saw the gdp figures and uh it was 5.7
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:53.520]  percent growth in the final quarter of last year and of that uh 60 percent or more uh was uh replacing
[2:15:53.520 --> 2:15:59.280]  inventory so the real growth was 2.4 percent officially it was probably a little bit less
[2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:04.480]  than that my guess was one and a half to two and a half percent but i'm not going to argue uh it was
[2:16:04.480 --> 2:16:14.160]  all created by infusion of capital of one kind of another and by the election you mean the 2010
[2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:20.000]  congressional election coming up you see them trying to uh stall the collapse until then you see
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:27.520]  things getting a lot worse next year yes and unless they come along with another oh i think the next
[2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:32.640]  time they'll need a trillion to a trillion and a half if they're going to do that you know the fed
[2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:37.680]  talks about withdrawing money from the system they can't do that it'll collapse they've taken money
[2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:46.160]  and credit the old m3 down from 17.4 percent uh to approximately 3 percent and you know the european
[2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:53.920]  central brink has brought these down from 12.8 percent to minus 0.08 percent why is the bank
[2:16:53.920 --> 2:17:00.560]  of england slowing printing for the same reason the others are that's all coordinated they're down
[2:17:01.120 --> 2:17:08.640]  to 3 percent and they were they had a higher 14 and a half percent and and what they're up to
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:16.160]  exactly i can't figure out because they're skating along the edge of deflationary depression
[2:17:16.160 --> 2:17:26.000]  by taking down m3 and m4 uh the the europeans call it m4 and and so they cannot take any money out of
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:31.280]  the system unless they want it to collapse but put this in layman terms because i study this
[2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:37.520]  constantly and i'm i'm with you but but but but barely so a lot of the audience may not
[2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:43.920]  in layman's terms they give themselves 28 trillion conservatively in the us alone other 20 trillion
[2:17:43.920 --> 2:17:50.400]  globally they're buying up all the real assets they're not letting local banks loan they clearly want
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:55.440]  to implode the economy so they can consolidate while they're claiming they're trying to hire jobs
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:18:01.840]  they're just massing the government against us growing their muscle against their slaves and if
[2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:08.400]  they and and the now central banks are starting to cut money supply and are starting to cut the
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:16.240]  issuance of currency which does forestall things so it looks like they want things to implode or
[2:18:16.240 --> 2:18:23.040]  or just stall it just long enough or what it's hard to tell um because we won't know until we get
[2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:30.160]  out further and that won't happen until later of the year and you see the fiasco that's going on
[2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:35.680]  in the european countries both in eastern europe as well as greece and now they're talking about
[2:18:35.680 --> 2:18:42.480]  portugal and spain and ireland which i've talked about for some time uh being problematic and now
[2:18:42.480 --> 2:18:49.120]  they are but you know people have to consider the dollars no panacea because their debt public
[2:18:49.120 --> 2:18:56.160]  debt to gdp will be about 95 percent this year well that's as bad as any country in the world
[2:18:56.720 --> 2:19:02.160]  i mean there's only a couple of countries that are that are higher and so the united states
[2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:07.200]  have got the same problems that everybody else has or vice versa so you see this debt
[2:19:07.200 --> 2:19:13.680]  implosion problem that's going on in europe nothing new they just discovered it it happened
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:20.640]  and we know the g20 is coordinating this why the reason why they want to want to do that
[2:19:21.200 --> 2:19:27.360]  is that uh they want to act in unison so they can help one another when they need to do what they
[2:19:27.360 --> 2:19:33.920]  are going to do see i don't know and i don't know anybody who does know outside the inner circle
[2:19:34.480 --> 2:19:40.240]  when they're going to pull the plug and go to a deflationary depression and they're eventually
[2:19:40.240 --> 2:19:47.200]  going to do that but they want to do it in their own way at their own time and they probably want
[2:19:47.200 --> 2:19:52.960]  to coordinate a war as a political smokescreen when they pull the trigger absolutely and there's a
[2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:57.680]  good chance of that in the middle east this year all right stay there yeah it's all coming together

[2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:51.680]  on the plane the state department i mean we know what they're doing and we're in a race to get the
[2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:57.680]  public to not just care about the super bowl but actually care about what the globalists are doing
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:05.040]  i mean looking at the method of their madness uh they've orchestrated this whole plan but now
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:12.400]  their plan their their cornerstone of the new carbon tax bubble is in deep trouble so what
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:16.800]  does that do to them because they're still going ahead with the plan though on every front
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:24.160]  they're on fire i mean they're falling apart are you right they are running uh running
[2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:35.520]  into uh uh uh uh problems that they didn't expect and uh uh i think that uh you talk about taxation
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:41.840]  the carbon tax uh that isn't going to happen anytime soon although our president said he's going to
[2:26:42.560 --> 2:26:48.400]  and run the situation and run through the epa of you as you pointed out before but i think the
[2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:54.880]  trial balloon for the comments which are open next week and the new which the public hasn't
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:27:03.040]  even heard about yet uh the new uh guaranteed annuity that the administration and the people
[2:27:03.040 --> 2:27:08.640]  who control it have planned uh we don't know what form it's going to come in but it's going to be a
[2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:16.800]  tax razor and it's going to be in some way uh something that the government can either use
[2:27:16.800 --> 2:27:24.960]  as collateral or get fresh funds in to fund their debt they have a heck of a time funding it uh last
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:31.200]  year the fed just in the treasuries alone uh purchased 80 percent of them and they're not
[2:27:31.200 --> 2:27:35.680]  going to tell you that but if you back into it you can see that a few writers that come out with it
[2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:42.080]  but most of them they don't know they don't understand so what this is this plan for this
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:47.600]  annuity it may come in any form right we don't know yet what it is but they're talking about
[2:27:47.600 --> 2:27:53.760]  a five percent tax like the social security tax and that money would be earmarked for an account
[2:27:53.760 --> 2:28:01.760]  for you uh acid annuity for the future and then uh they also talked about a voluntary plan whereby
[2:28:01.760 --> 2:28:08.080]  somebody could pledge a certain percentage of their retirement whether it's pension a 401k or IRA
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:16.720]  etc into uh this government annuity or the whole thing or they could have a mandatory program
[2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:21.280]  i'm putting all this out because number one eventually they're going to try to steal your
[2:28:21.280 --> 2:28:26.480]  retirement and number two the desperate funds and you ask whether they're going to get the taxes from
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:30.960]  or get the money from tax wise and this i think is how they think they're going to do it
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:36.720]  bob incredible i mean that's why we have you on so often because sometimes i can't see the
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:41.600]  forest for the trees i'm sitting here saying of their environmental takeover is in trouble
[2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:48.320]  what are they going to do to fund their operation and in plain view you've been saying for five years
[2:28:48.320 --> 2:28:52.960]  and i have as well when bush changed the rules to take pensions and now they've changed the rules
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:56.560]  to take money markets and now they're saying they're going to take your pension and put it in a
[2:28:56.560 --> 2:29:04.240]  government fund and tax it uh that clearly they're now moving to do that and it's just so outrageous
[2:29:04.240 --> 2:29:09.440]  that even though i know they're already starting to do it i can't believe they're that bold i mean
[2:29:09.440 --> 2:29:13.920]  if they're asking for a revolution isn't that the quickest way to get it is to steal people's
[2:29:13.920 --> 2:29:21.840]  retirement you got it you're absolutely correct and desperate people do desperate things and again
[2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:27.520]  we have forced them into this position and that's why they're pushing ahead on all fronts such as
[2:29:27.520 --> 2:29:34.720]  the things with homeland security the federalization of law enforcement and all the other things that
[2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:39.600]  you talk about on the program stay there bob yeah they're running scared i want you to come back
[2:29:39.600 --> 2:29:43.600]  and flesh out because i mean this is this is mainstream now that they're taking the pension
[2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:48.640]  funds private companies are the government's getting ready to snatch it uh the health care plans
[2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:55.360]  in trouble that was a new big tax stay there we're on the march the empires on the run

[2:33:12.560 --> 2:33:16.480]  bob chatman's our guest i'm gonna open the phones up specifically for questions for bob
[2:33:16.480 --> 2:33:25.040]  chatman 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 bob you got cut off by that break
[2:33:26.480 --> 2:33:31.680]  i mean when we get up here five years ago four years ago two years ago last month
[2:33:32.400 --> 2:33:37.520]  and read the mainstream articles where the government comes out and says oh we'll take your
[2:33:37.520 --> 2:33:44.080]  private pension plans and the government will keep them in tax them but pay them out to you
[2:33:44.080 --> 2:33:51.440]  and oh your money markets aren't protected you know three percent or something uh returns
[2:33:51.440 --> 2:33:56.560]  people get i mean i've got a bank account that's a money market uh that's not protected i mean
[2:33:56.560 --> 2:34:02.640]  that's destroying confidence and then their health care plan is a massive tax increase on
[2:34:02.640 --> 2:34:07.520]  basically everybody except some of the poorest americans uh and then it's a tax on them because
[2:34:07.520 --> 2:34:13.360]  more companies will just lay people off to be able to pay for the health care and so they're
[2:34:13.360 --> 2:34:18.560]  failing on that plan because it's so unconstitutional and transparently corrupt that's what i'm saying
[2:34:18.560 --> 2:34:23.840]  the carbon taxes they're in trouble the uh health care money grab they're in trouble
[2:34:23.840 --> 2:34:33.040]  so what are they going to do bob it's hard to say um i don't know i i i just don't see anything
[2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:38.080]  on the horizon but you know we'll hear it leaking out of washington they you know they have these
[2:34:38.080 --> 2:34:45.840]  things tanks going and they've been going for years and incidentally uh that uh program of uh
[2:34:46.400 --> 2:34:52.640]  of uh guaranteed annuities by the united states government that's been in formation since 1995
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:59.600]  this is really nothing new uh it's just getting here now or they pulled it up when they thought
[2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:08.160]  they needed it desperately if you may and um and if they if they oppose the five percent tax for
[2:35:08.160 --> 2:35:14.560]  savings then uh that probably will help them quite a bit but i don't think the public state
[2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:20.000]  electronic straight jacket over the senate is creating a police state electronic straight
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:28.720]  jacket over the state is creating a police state electronic straight jacket over the states we're
[2:35:28.720 --> 2:35:33.360]  not just saying that we have the john warner defense authorization act reauthorized since
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:40.080]  2007 we have pdd 51 we have the council of governors which is so the president can claim
[2:35:40.080 --> 2:35:44.800]  he's in control of the states and well the council of governors agrees his 10 hand-picked
[2:35:44.800 --> 2:35:50.240]  minions you could have 49 states telling one state they had to do something unconstitutional
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:56.080]  it doesn't stand uh you have north com admittedly set up for the american people you have them trying
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:00.720]  to put military on the streets everywhere you have them with the naked body scanners they're
[2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:09.040]  clearly trying to get this grid in place to suppress peaceful uh revolution uh against them
[2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:14.400]  but they're not giving people anywhere to go they're not giving people any out i mean this is going
[2:36:14.400 --> 2:36:21.120]  to be very explosive this is not uh argentina where they're disarmed or nigeria where they're
[2:36:21.120 --> 2:36:27.520]  disarmed or romania or something i mean this is a recipe for disaster and the establishment is so
[2:36:27.520 --> 2:36:32.400]  hubris filled they're still moving forward or maybe they're not hubris filled maybe that's why
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:38.480]  cast sunstein and other white house are right that quote the conspiracy theorist are a danger
[2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:44.320]  and are hurting them bob Chapman well that's right and and i i think you hit it on the head
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:50.240]  and i'm doing a piece right now that i'll finish over the weekend for next ad wednesday's issue
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:57.920]  and it's control of the internet and of course if they go for that uh through the u n or whatever
[2:36:58.720 --> 2:37:06.640]  way they do that then uh what'll happen is they'll pursue uh us on radio as well
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:13.120]  and they got to shut us up and so there's going to be moves in that direction but you know something
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:19.520]  i think they're a little bit too late i think they waited too long or they get rushed into the
[2:37:19.520 --> 2:37:25.440]  situation by yourself and others well the trains already left the station everybody exactly we've
[2:37:25.440 --> 2:37:30.720]  already told the people the dvds the books the newsletters are out there and the more they try
[2:37:30.720 --> 2:37:37.440]  to censor us the more people want to find out what's going on that's right you know it's just like
[2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:43.840]  when you try to hide something there's a reason for it you probably did something wrong and the
[2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:50.240]  federal reserve is a wonderful example um it's a state secret or you don't have a need to know
[2:37:50.240 --> 2:37:56.320]  and it's a private corporation i mean that's ridiculous and so why is the federal reserve
[2:37:56.320 --> 2:38:02.160]  doing that why are they battling so hard to keep 1207 which is in that appropriations bill
[2:38:02.160 --> 2:38:06.960]  from getting passed because they don't want everybody to know what they're doing well the
[2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:12.960]  same is true not only with the fed but right through our government and wall street i mean you
[2:38:12.960 --> 2:38:19.040]  saw the hearings uh this uh uh this Lloyd blank find get something says well we're we're doing
[2:38:19.040 --> 2:38:25.760]  god's work and we made a few mistakes yeah as they collected hundreds of billions of dollars
[2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:34.080]  from the american investor or the american citizen and they justify that well if you don't let us do
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:40.640]  it we'll crash the system that's really what they're saying and i i work with these people for 28
[2:38:40.640 --> 2:38:46.240]  years i know where they're coming from and this is terrorism this is illegal financial terrorism
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:50.800]  that they have been engaging in and they have wrecked hundreds of third world countries and
[2:38:50.800 --> 2:38:57.680]  first world nations in the last hundred years they will make us destitute and homeless if they are
[2:38:57.680 --> 2:39:04.720]  able to successfully pull this off this is life and death for our economy our society our future
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:12.480]  progeny this is for all the marbles and that's why i get so disgusted by adults who are losing their
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:18.880]  jobs or getting their pay cut wealthy poor people it doesn't matter they don't still many of them
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:24.960]  seem to care they only care about who's going to win the super bowl this sunday that's exactly
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:31.280]  right and they ruined many many personal lives all over the world particularly with these uh
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:38.000]  uh collateralized debt obligations which are the bonds which have the uh mortgages inside of them
[2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:43.280]  60 percent of them were sold in europe so it's not only only american institutions
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:49.600]  that bought them and lost piles of money but it was europeans as well and others but uh
[2:39:50.800 --> 2:40:00.480]  you know this to me as a professional within that area is grotesque i mean how could they ever
[2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:07.200]  think that they could get away with this what they did is they got the raiders which is moody's
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:13.840]  and fitch and s and p to say that this was triple i paper the best you can buy when in fact it was
[2:40:13.840 --> 2:40:25.280]  a triple b and the inclusion with not only the raiders but also the fed reserve and the lenders
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:34.400]  themselves and it was a whole group of people who were involved in this giant trillion multi
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:42.560]  trillion dollar scam you're absolutely right alex and now it's come out in mcclatchy newspapers
[2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:47.840]  and other places documents they got from goldman that they premeditatedly rigged all this
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:53.600]  to destroy their competition and destroy the economy and come out on top with their insider
[2:40:53.600 --> 2:40:58.240]  knowledge and now they're trying to bring us into the next phase i want to go to calls
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:06.720]  here bomb but what is going to happen from your past experience in research as people find out
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:12.800]  the economy is actually getting worse and not better well we're going to get more disturbed
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:20.000]  there'll be more layoffs there'll be more people going bankrupt it'll be harder to live the way
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:27.360]  that we've lived over the past um we'll say 50 years is gone could probably gone forever um that's
[2:41:27.360 --> 2:41:35.280]  hard to say forever but probably gone forever and they are are going to demonstrate and eventually
[2:41:35.280 --> 2:41:42.720]  the demonstrations will if they can't accomplish what they want through congress then they will
[2:41:42.720 --> 2:41:49.680]  probably be a revolution let's go to phone calls ladies and gentlemen let's talk to john
[2:41:49.680 --> 2:41:53.920]  in illinois you're on the air with bob shaman hello i just want to say i appreciate your show
[2:41:53.920 --> 2:42:00.240]  mr jones and uh question i have for uh mr chappman is um how do you feel that uh george
[2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:06.560]  soros his statement about gold being a bubble affected the market currently and also with
[2:42:06.560 --> 2:42:12.320]  all the manipulations that the banks do um do you think they can control the price of gold for
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:19.360]  much longer let me add this before bob answers last friday here i played the clip for bomb uh
[2:42:19.360 --> 2:42:26.720]  of soros on wednesday of last bragging that they were about to try to pop the gold bubble uh so
[2:42:26.720 --> 2:42:31.120]  was soros involved what are the central banks doing we know it's been exposed they do manipulate
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:37.200]  gold why are they trying to drive gold down right now well first of all george soros is an arch
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:43.760]  criminal he's a multi-billionaire he's a top aluminist uh he was convicted of rigging the
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:49.680]  stock market in france he appealed and lost and he was convicted in hungary as well in recent years
[2:42:50.480 --> 2:42:56.960]  uh he he's a front man for the aluminists whatever they want done he does it in eastern europe
[2:42:56.960 --> 2:43:02.800]  they had these colored revolutions he was behind the whole thing and of course when these guys die
[2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:07.520]  all the money goes back to the aluminists that's the way it works by the way you're not just saying
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:11.520]  that i want you to continue your point it came out in the british news and russian news that every
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:17.120]  time putin arrested oligarch it turns out they owned literally nothing and everything is lord roth
[2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:24.000]  child's that's right and ross i'll bank bank rolled the whole thing and so what are they doing to go
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:30.320]  pardon me i mean i'm i interrupted you from the question the caller's question oh what's going on
[2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:39.920]  with the rigging and in what sector well i mean soros soros i mean with the gold yes well what he
[2:43:39.920 --> 2:43:47.920]  was the stocking horse in in this uh in the charade he kicked the downside off and then the central
[2:43:47.920 --> 2:43:53.280]  banks would use derivatives through the major broker terms such as goldman sacks jp morgan
[2:43:53.280 --> 2:44:01.200]  chase city group etc and they shorted gold they are already short big time triple what is normal
[2:44:01.200 --> 2:44:08.000]  in the comics and the lbma which is the london equivalent is even worse i mean i think they're
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:13.040]  short 50 tons of gold and they don't have any windows i mean for those that don't understand
[2:44:13.040 --> 2:44:18.080]  shorting when when are the contracts of the main group of contracts up because now they've got to
[2:44:18.080 --> 2:44:23.280]  short it because they already bet it in shorting or they lose their shirt that's right and shorting
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:29.440]  is betting it's going to go down and so they've been doing that but ultimately they have to cover
[2:44:29.440 --> 2:44:35.120]  which means buy it back in again and i don't know what what level they're going to do that my guess
[2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:41.920]  is probably somewhere between a thousand and thirty three and perhaps a thousand and seventy
[2:44:41.920 --> 2:44:49.280]  that there's a number of reasons that i won't go into uh to address and but he front ran this attack
[2:44:49.280 --> 2:44:56.240]  on gold and it's a second attack in like two months but the second part of the question was
[2:44:56.240 --> 2:45:01.680]  can they continue to do it and the answer is no and the reason why is they don't have the physical
[2:45:01.680 --> 2:45:10.400]  bullion to sell into the market and that's where they're stopped cold and so when they use derivatives
[2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:18.160]  futures to go in and drive prices down they only can do it for a short period of time
[2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:23.920]  several days at the most and that's it and answer the question why do they want to drive
[2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:28.400]  gold down am i right in saying because it will expose the weakness of the dollar
[2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:34.400]  or it'll expose the weakness of the dollar and the whole system whenever gold goes up
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:41.360]  it's like the canary in the coal mine it's the tip off that something is dramatically wrong in some
[2:45:41.360 --> 2:45:48.960]  society and gold's going up because the society is on the brink uh economically financially
[2:45:48.960 --> 2:45:54.240]  whatever and that is what's happening and so they've been suppressing gold they started 1988
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:46:00.720]  i wrote my first article uh for the bull and bear saying the market is being manipulated
[2:46:00.720 --> 2:46:05.520]  and i explained how they were doing it and everybody told me i was insane well of course
[2:46:05.520 --> 2:46:11.840]  they don't do that anymore because it is common knowledge now especially on wall street all right
[2:46:11.840 --> 2:46:16.720]  let's go markets but particularly the gold market is being manipulated john did that answer your
[2:46:16.720 --> 2:46:25.760]  questions i was just curious to you know i know it's impossible to tell but uh uh well you know
[2:46:25.760 --> 2:46:32.960]  because what about silver also uh did you expect the price uh because they're short that market
[2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:41.200]  also well you're right and there's two big players that are short about 60 of the contracts
[2:46:41.200 --> 2:46:52.080]  and jp morgan chase and hsbc hong kong shank i bank and it's illegal and the fc at cftc stands there
[2:46:52.640 --> 2:46:57.520]  and is allowed it to go on ever since bierstern's went on so what you're saying they are gonna
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:05.040]  rise but you you're expecting a drop in silver no it's already happened yeah but continuing or
[2:47:05.040 --> 2:47:12.480]  no no it'll base out here somewhere in the 15 uh the 16 dollar area and in gold should base out
[2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:18.560]  here as well and we'll start running back up mad when do you see gold running back up
[2:47:19.920 --> 2:47:25.520]  oh i think it can happen before june maybe even before april okay they don't have any
[2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:32.880]  lasting lasting power i mean they've lost their bullion positions because hold them off over the
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:37.920]  last 20 years they're swimming upstream against the market thank you john michael in california
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:42.800]  here on the air with bob shatman hey thank you guys it's so timely you're having this conversation

[2:48:44.080 --> 2:48:50.560]  to protect your family and uh it's amazing how many people around me as i try to have conversations
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:56.880]  with people really just uh they can really shy away from it as if it's uh extreme well let me
[2:48:56.880 --> 2:49:00.640]  comment on that michael as we're going into break they have made it fashionable they've been telling
[2:49:00.640 --> 2:49:06.640]  people for a hundred years don't talk about politics and religion when talking about politics
[2:49:06.640 --> 2:49:12.720]  and religion is what created this country and they tell you it's weird to be protected it's
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:18.400]  weird to own guns it's weird to be self-sufficient it's weird to know how to fish it's weird to
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:25.920]  know how to skin a deer as a human being i'm high tech i'm modern but i also i'm primitive i i i keep
[2:49:25.920 --> 2:49:32.560]  those aspects about myself i i know a little bit about nature and how to be self-sufficient uh i'm
[2:49:32.560 --> 2:49:40.720]  not a domesticated complete jellyfish and so what you've got is domesticated soft palmed jellyfish
[2:49:40.720 --> 2:49:46.880]  look at katrina look at california collapsing and making the state workers work one day a week
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:53.360]  for free look at haiti the government can't and won't and will not take care of you and in all these
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:59.200]  intensifying crises the fact that people don't even have the basic instinct to want to prepare
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:03.840]  like a grass you know a grasshopper doesn't prepare for the winter the ant does a squirrel
[2:50:03.840 --> 2:50:08.320]  prepares for the winter i've got the smarts of a squirrel your average football watcher doesn't
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:16.400]  bob Chapman i agree and you know it's all there all they have to do is start using it and how
[2:50:16.400 --> 2:50:23.280]  how how can that come about uh all they have to do is listen and your program is one of those ways
[2:50:23.280 --> 2:50:29.040]  or my publication for that matter and uh and you know there's a lot of things that just have to be
[2:50:29.040 --> 2:50:35.680]  exposed to people and say oh yeah i was wondering about that and all of a sudden it clicks in i get
[2:50:35.680 --> 2:50:41.920]  so many emails and talk to so many people said i woke up six months ago or a year or two years ago
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:48.320]  and i think that's terrific and it's because of the into death and my publication in your program
[2:50:48.320 --> 2:50:54.480]  and other programs and so on and we are getting there the thing is can we get there fast enough

[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:24.880]  news and continue with your phone calls uh right now let's go to michael in texas you're on the
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:31.920]  air with bob Chapman go ahead oh he just dropped man okay they do that right when you go to him
[2:55:31.920 --> 2:55:39.280]  jerry and indiana go ahead hey alex and uh bob Chapman thanks for standing up for liberty and
[2:55:39.280 --> 2:55:45.600]  freedom uh i got a question for bob here you know i've talked to our congressman and representatives
[2:55:45.600 --> 2:55:50.720]  because things are really bad here in indiana unemployment wise just like across the nation
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:57.120]  and i tell these people you know the definition of a third world is a is a country with no
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:56:05.520]  manufacturing base how did bob how do they expect to bring jobs back with nafta and gatt in place
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:13.680]  it's just ridiculous it's not going to happen unless we can change the complexion of congress
[2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:23.120]  and pass tariffs on goods and services like we had since 1800 which helped make america a very strong
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:30.160]  nation and a lot of people until ism go ahead go ahead mercantilism mercantilism is what free
[2:56:30.160 --> 2:56:35.680]  trade globalization offshoring and outsourcing is all about uh it's carried on by translational
[2:56:35.680 --> 2:56:42.160]  conglomerates that keep their profits offshore and don't pay taxes on them and so that's why
[2:56:42.160 --> 2:56:47.120]  congress doesn't want to pass that because they're all paid off by them and it's called campaign
[2:56:47.120 --> 2:56:53.600]  contributions and so you got to change congress and then we got to put the ax in and once we get
[2:56:53.600 --> 2:56:58.720]  that passed everybody in the world is going to be mad at us it's just too bad we get the biggest
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:06.000]  market in the world and if you have tariffs on things what's going to happen is the manufacturers
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:12.240]  who moved out are going to have no advantage of being where they are now let's say in china
[2:57:12.240 --> 2:57:17.200]  because the tariffs are going to make everything equal and let's expand on that with environmental
[2:57:17.200 --> 2:57:23.760]  rules and regulations we have a tariff on ourself against our own goods it's not for your fair to
[2:57:23.760 --> 2:57:31.760]  compete against mexico or india and you can you can impound that into the tariff you can say
[2:57:31.760 --> 2:57:38.880]  you don't have any environmental controls and so instead of charging you 50 50 cents per item
[2:57:38.880 --> 2:57:44.480]  we're going to charge you 75 to make up for that and then all that money goes in the treasury
[2:57:46.080 --> 2:57:50.240]  and that's how we're supposed to fund the country instead of the stinking income tax
[2:57:50.240 --> 2:57:57.360]  that goes to the private banks that's right absolutely and yeah i mean who knows better
[2:57:57.360 --> 2:58:01.200]  the bankers that have raped and robbed us or the founding fathers that made america great
[2:58:01.200 --> 2:58:06.160]  whose system do we want a bunch of fancy bankers come in here and tell us what they're going to
[2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:12.080]  do for us and how great it's going to be and it's wrecked us by design this is by design any other
[2:58:12.080 --> 2:58:19.120]  comments jerry and indiana yes um you know my dad taught me from a young 56 years old now but he
[2:58:19.120 --> 2:58:25.280]  taught me the young age you back somebody in a corner they're going to come out fight what does
[2:58:25.280 --> 2:58:32.960]  a new world order think of 200 million armed civilians bob they are going to be terrified
[2:58:32.960 --> 2:58:39.600]  and if they bring in foreign troops i can promise you our military will make sure that they don't

[2:59:09.600 --> 2:59:15.200]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:59:15.200 --> 2:59:20.240]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[2:59:20.240 --> 2:59:25.360]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[2:59:25.360 --> 2:59:29.520]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from

[3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:42.880]  the air worldwide hi alex uh thanks for having me on this is our um indeed a pleasure it's
[3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:48.240]  first-time caller i have sort of like two questions regarding the the federal reserve for bob
[3:00:48.240 --> 3:00:53.360]  and what i want to know is i heard that the federal reserve and a lot of the central banks
[3:00:54.240 --> 3:01:00.480]  do what's called double booking go where they double up what they say they purport and have it
[3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:07.360]  and then the other question that i want to ask you is with regards to if the audit should occur
[3:01:07.360 --> 3:01:16.400]  and all this unraveling of of of corruption is unveiled to the masses what and how would that
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:20.960]  impact the gold the gold reserves and and the price of gold
[3:01:23.920 --> 3:01:28.640]  first of all it'll make gold go up and secondly we don't even know whether they have any gold
[3:01:28.640 --> 3:01:34.720]  i haven't had an audit since 1954 and we see over the last couple of years in the in the
[3:01:34.720 --> 3:01:45.040]  general market uh where uh a non-good delivery gold has showed up which is coin melt and as
[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:50.640]  far as i know the only nation in modern history that's melted coins was the united states government
[3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:57.520]  and so they have sold gold we don't know how much uh i know that there's gold in fort nox because
[3:01:57.520 --> 3:02:03.120]  one of the military people in one of the programs said look i was guarding it there's something there
[3:02:03.120 --> 3:02:09.360]  i don't know who it belongs to i don't know what's inside the gold looking bars but we got we guarded
[3:02:09.360 --> 3:02:14.560]  them and i was headed the detail let me expand on this let me expand on this though for those
[3:02:14.560 --> 3:02:20.800]  don't understand they had a little bit of copper or other you know maybe one percent or less into
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:27.280]  gold coins so that they're not soft so the faces don't wear off and so people can easily grind them
[3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:37.600]  down pure gold um uh melts very easily deforms very easily and so yes gold has shown up between
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:42.880]  central banks that supposedly you know pure gold like it's supposed to come in the bars
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:51.200]  and it's not pure showing chicaneries going on go ahead bob and so uh we don't know what the
[3:02:51.200 --> 3:02:56.080]  u.s has it would be nice if they had everything they say they have but we know that's not so
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:03:01.920]  so and this goes back to late sixties uh linden johnson we don't know what he did and then they
[3:03:01.920 --> 3:03:06.320]  they had the rosa bonds which are all redeemed which are bonds were given out and backed by
[3:03:06.320 --> 3:03:12.240]  gold and people took the gold instead of taking the cash and uh but you know they never reported
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:17.760]  on it uh all we can do is guess at what they did they hide these things all the time and the
[3:03:17.760 --> 3:03:23.760]  question is why do they get to be so secretive well because they're doing something they shouldn't
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:29.440]  be doing and that brings us back to the first question which about the fed reserve a double
[3:03:29.440 --> 3:03:40.320]  counting or a double end uh having double uh um sets of books well yeah we could call it two sets
[3:03:40.320 --> 3:03:46.400]  of books and he answers yes but we won't know until we get there and when we get there the people
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:53.280]  will be enraged and i would think that the other bill that ron paul has which would do away with
[3:03:53.280 --> 3:03:59.360]  the fed would be passed and their responsibilities would be passed back to the u.s. treasury where
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:06.720]  they laid under the constitution until the act in nineteen sixteen nineteen thirteen and um
[3:04:07.520 --> 3:04:14.400]  and one of the important things if that happens is that we stop the revolving door between wall
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:21.840]  street banking and the u.s. government because they really control the government i mean it's
[3:04:21.840 --> 3:04:26.880]  a one oh one conflict of interest uh i appreciate uh your call micah to hear from her come back and
[3:04:26.880 --> 3:04:32.640]  talk to john mic kathy tom and others but i want to make a point when we return and get bob's take
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:39.200]  on it we've seen this fellow reserve disinfo put out really through the patriot community as cast
[3:04:39.200 --> 3:04:45.920]  sunstein at the white house said they've lost so much credibility they have to pose as us to then
[3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:52.960]  get any credibility and they've been putting out this this this this parrot message over and over
[3:04:52.960 --> 3:04:58.320]  again that you better not audit the fed because you'll get something worse you can't get something
[3:04:58.320 --> 3:05:03.040]  worse we're already under a financial dictatorship of these people will be right back

[3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:12.160]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[3:08:12.160 --> 3:08:21.680]  red beckman talked about yesterday the fact that we've really been fully under the new world order
[3:08:21.680 --> 3:08:28.960]  since the mid eighties the u.s. has been seized and used as a weapon an engine of tyranny worldwide
[3:08:28.960 --> 3:08:33.200]  and we've been given tyranny here domestically as well we're being treated like the third world
[3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:40.240]  nations at the private banks of fraudulent conquer the fell reserve is just a holding company front
[3:08:40.240 --> 3:08:47.520]  for the top less than 10 banks it was 10 back at the time of the fellow reserve act it's been very
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:52.160]  secretive but some of the information has come out and their partners with the bank of england
[3:08:52.160 --> 3:08:57.280]  their partners with the boondis bank they coordinate through the g20 they don't even deny this anymore
[3:08:57.920 --> 3:09:04.480]  and so you abolish the fellow reserve you put the power back under the congress which is in the
[3:09:04.480 --> 3:09:09.920]  constitution and you educate the public about the issuance of currency and credit and you turn
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:15.360]  credit loose to be an engine for the population you know it came out over a decade ago the
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:20.640]  comprehensive annual financial reports that they set up in the early fifties in chicago and by the
[3:09:20.640 --> 3:09:25.440]  seventies became the model of the country and the world australia has them england has them
[3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:32.480]  germany has them canada has it and so they they use lawyer tricks to distract the public they say
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:38.080]  oh well on budget we've got a budget shortfall or on budget we need more taxes when the budget
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:44.240]  generally is less than about 15 percent and that's just a dead reckoning estimation of the state of
[3:09:44.240 --> 3:09:52.320]  texas travis county where i live similar around other parts of the country in the world you know
[3:09:52.320 --> 3:09:58.560]  some places the budget's 30 compared to the real assets of the comprehensive annual financial
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:10:03.920]  report we have a dvd documentary i produced called annual financial comprehensive annual
[3:10:03.920 --> 3:10:10.640]  financial reports exposed and once we started exposing this in the late nineties with walter
[3:10:10.640 --> 3:10:17.200]  birian and others uh and and and bob and many others exposing it these were public before
[3:10:17.200 --> 3:10:21.360]  but the age of the internet they're now making most of it secret but you can still see the
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:27.520]  summaries and so what you have is the state of texas or the university of texas these are just
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:34.720]  examples where last time i checked university of texas had 50 plus billion dollars in assets separate
[3:10:34.720 --> 3:10:39.680]  from their oil and gas and land holdings because in texas the feds don't own much property the state
[3:10:39.680 --> 3:10:44.960]  of texas owns a bunch and it goes to the university funds but that's separate even from that they take
[3:10:44.960 --> 3:10:51.280]  that money and they put it in player channel radio for an example they put it in the rangers
[3:10:51.280 --> 3:10:57.680]  baseball team uh they they put it in defense contractors they put it in uh all sorts of programs
[3:10:57.680 --> 3:11:03.760]  they invested in carbon credit allotments and so they're taking your money and then giving it to
[3:11:03.760 --> 3:11:09.360]  private interests so people who say oh we better not get rid of the federal reserve will get something
[3:11:09.360 --> 3:11:15.360]  worse you can't get something worse we have a dictatorship of the private banks controlling
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:20.400]  our economy and feeding our wealth into their systems and then they have control of the insider
[3:11:20.400 --> 3:11:28.080]  trading and selectively enforce and allow them in their cronies to do this so uh could if we start
[3:11:28.080 --> 3:11:32.800]  auditing the fed and get ready to abolish it yeah they're going to come back with some new thing that
[3:11:32.800 --> 3:11:38.320]  gives them the same power again but they already have unlimited fraudulent power so you can't get
[3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:44.160]  anything worse you get into the fed as brunakis admitted that would destroy the fed because it's
[3:11:44.160 --> 3:11:49.840]  so corrupt you will further discredit them and send them all to prison so anybody that says and
[3:11:49.840 --> 3:11:56.320]  I hear this mantra don't audit the fed Ron Paul's bad it is pure baloney bob Chapman
[3:11:57.440 --> 3:12:02.240]  I couldn't have said it better you covered it all you hit it right on the hand and that's the way
[3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:07.520]  it's bent and you know this goes all about all the way back to the 12th century that we know of
[3:12:08.320 --> 3:12:14.240]  most recorded history only goes back to the 7th century but beyond there it's smattering until
[3:12:14.240 --> 3:12:21.360]  you get into the Renaissance and and and so this is nothing new this has been done over and over
[3:12:21.360 --> 3:12:27.040]  and over again and that's how I'm able to back into what these people will do next there's all
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:31.600]  you have to do is look at history and what they did before they're monopoly men if they can get
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:36.800]  control of the government and the issuance of currency and credit as the Rothschilds constantly
[3:12:36.800 --> 3:12:43.040]  said and put on the doorways of their houses that as long as we control the issuance of currency
[3:12:43.040 --> 3:12:52.960]  and credit I don't care who the king is can they create money to finance the king's wars
[3:12:54.960 --> 3:13:02.240]  and they finance the king's enemies so they've got to come to them that's right both sides of every
[3:13:02.240 --> 3:13:13.920]  conflict Saddam Hussein CIA bin Laden CIA Fidel Castro CIA it's all staged pull pot CIA Brazinski
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:21.040]  brags about it and he's one of the main architects along with Henry Kissinger
[3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:27.680]  fortunately they're getting old hey let me ask you people here to take their place that's for
[3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:32.880]  sure I want to go to Mike Kathy Tom and Kevin quickly here Bob but who are the new super
[3:13:32.880 --> 3:13:40.560]  gophers because we really don't see a Richard Holbrook or uh you know somebody like that a
[3:13:40.560 --> 3:13:46.480]  Rahm Emanuel replacing these super gophers of the elite I mean who do you see to replace
[3:13:46.480 --> 3:13:53.360]  David Rockefeller and people like that it's hard call right now I just can't answer that I don't
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:14:00.400]  know I mean either hey because it seems like those old timers were a lot more hard working
[3:14:00.400 --> 3:14:08.080]  you talk to more modern globalist and they really seem soft well it's certainly not aggressive and
[3:14:08.080 --> 3:14:16.000]  we certainly don't know who's being groomed are which ones are being groomed and uh it's
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:22.640]  generally kept from us and most of the people we know who are involved now at the upper level are
[3:14:22.640 --> 3:14:31.280]  the semi-upper level they usually from 65 years old onward occasionally they'll be 55 or onward
[3:14:31.280 --> 3:14:37.440]  but they usually older men let's talk to John in Florida then Mike and others go ahead John
[3:14:38.320 --> 3:14:44.880]  hi thanks for having me I got a couple questions um as far as if we have a revolution and what
[3:14:44.880 --> 3:14:50.800]  have you and we totally destroy the tyrannical government we have in place what happens to
[3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:56.800]  our money we have in savings um as far as does the dollar turn do we go that's how they hold
[3:14:56.800 --> 3:15:03.440]  this hostage we've had a 98 percent evaluation since 1913 and it's just like a bad employee
[3:15:04.080 --> 3:15:08.560]  or uh you know sometimes a mean husband that's beating you up you just gotta leave
[3:15:08.560 --> 3:15:13.760]  I mean I mean it's gonna be rough either way Bob Chapman well if you've gotten money in the bank
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:21.120]  and uh in the general stock market and in bonds you're gonna lose a lot of money maybe all of it the
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:29.040]  only safe place to be is the gold and silver all right I you go ahead with what the schedule
[3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:32.640]  with the schedule reserve thing I was speaking with the bank or the other day and they couldn't
[3:15:32.640 --> 3:15:38.560]  enlight me on the fact but I see with my savings account we get a uh under a quarter percent interest
[3:15:38.560 --> 3:15:45.680]  um for savings in turn the bank loans me somebody else's money which is the way that the money is
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:52.400]  that they give me in loans at 3 percent 18 percent and how is it legal for them to do that with the
[3:15:52.400 --> 3:15:58.080]  federal reserve having the interest rate set at zero to uh quarter percent because that low
[3:15:58.080 --> 3:16:05.840]  rate is for the bankers not for you Bob Chapman that's right and incidentally you may not be
[3:16:05.840 --> 3:16:16.000]  borrowing your neighbor's deposit because the banks historically have created 8 to 10 times more
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:22.640]  credit than what they have in deposits that's right you're paying interest you're go ahead
[3:16:23.680 --> 3:16:32.960]  and recently uh uh during this last go-around uh they got 40 to 50 to 60 to 70 times
[3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:40.000]  basic deposits and they had to know that they were going to get in trouble yeah to explain that
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:47.280]  stupid to explain that they're charging people with credit cards in many cases 25 30 interest
[3:16:47.280 --> 3:16:53.440]  on literally made up money okay so they want you to default so that they get your real assets
[3:16:53.440 --> 3:16:57.280]  and get control of you the name of the game is control thank you john mike and wyoming you're
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:06.960]  on the air mike yes hi uh alex bob uh bob are you keeping up with this ubs situation versus the
[3:17:07.680 --> 3:17:13.920]  the irs near the swiss government right and the swiss governments come back uh unofficially and
[3:17:13.920 --> 3:17:20.400]  said well uh you know ubs under the law in switzerland can't do that and uh another
[3:17:20.400 --> 3:17:27.920]  uh prominent person uh within the swiss government says well if if you do that and
[3:17:27.920 --> 3:17:33.040]  make them expose these people well the biggest bank in the country is going to go under yeah that
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:39.760]  was times in london and thousands of people are going to be unemployed at et cetera and he's right
[3:17:40.720 --> 3:17:45.520]  and you know they let switzerland do what they did for many many years people brought
[3:17:45.520 --> 3:17:52.080]  wealth to switzerland to have it professionally managed but also to avoid onerous taxation
[3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:58.960]  by different countries and by the way they are selectively looting those offshore bank accounts
[3:17:58.960 --> 3:18:03.280]  all the big boys do whatever they want offshore and don't get touched they want to rob people
[3:18:03.280 --> 3:18:09.280]  that got a few million dollars or whatever and you're right about that i lived in switzerland
[3:18:09.280 --> 3:18:14.000]  i know the mentality in fact i went to school at the university they should have i took uh
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:21.440]  the interpreters course for french and uh so living in switzerland for three years speaking
[3:18:21.440 --> 3:18:25.200]  both french and german you get a pretty good idea of where people are coming from when you
[3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:34.240]  got to remember that during the war they cooperated fully with germany and when germany uh wanted to
[3:18:34.240 --> 3:18:39.920]  get things that they could get otherwise the swiss would help them do it or manufacture it for them
[3:18:39.920 --> 3:18:47.120]  and they would store much of the stolen things that were taken from people who were put into camps
[3:18:47.920 --> 3:18:56.640]  and uh uh it was dreadful what they did really dreadful anything else mic
[3:18:57.440 --> 3:19:01.600]  yeah my question is is there a safe haven these days if uh if the swiss are gone
[3:19:02.960 --> 3:19:07.600]  no there's no there's no i i i i i don't think there's any safe havens left

[3:24:31.440 --> 3:24:37.680]  we gave up our saint season tickets this year in order to finance our radio show that's how
[3:24:37.680 --> 3:24:44.000]  dedicated we were um we were able to share um the whole truth with new orleans about the fad
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:50.800]  cap and trade copenhagen we were able to save countless number of people of not taking the
[3:24:50.800 --> 3:24:56.960]  swine flu shot and was worth every penny you know it's funny you brought that thank you it's funny
[3:24:56.960 --> 3:25:01.600]  you brought that up kathy because in the next segment i was going to talk about boycotting the
[3:25:01.600 --> 3:25:09.040]  superbowl and i'll explain why when we come back but but you just crystallized it swine flu shot
[3:25:09.040 --> 3:25:15.840]  killing people full of mercury economy falling apart our country sliding into depression and
[3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:21.440]  it's not that the superbowl is bad it's that we better make some sacrifices and get our head
[3:25:21.440 --> 3:25:27.600]  screwed on straight for real issues or we're going to lose it all and be like argentina or
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:35.680]  nigeria bob jetman well i think you're absolutely right and uh this is a way to do it and it's about
[3:25:35.680 --> 3:25:45.600]  time people turned away from the frivialities of uh of uh this the social life of america in fact
[3:25:45.600 --> 3:25:52.000]  worldwide you gotta get serious about what's going on uh it's very very bad and it's not
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:56.480]  going to get better it's going to get worse you've got to change her to grip you've got to change
[3:25:56.480 --> 3:26:03.920]  your priorities how much how much were you able to sell season tickets for now we didn't even
[3:26:03.920 --> 3:26:10.880]  tell them we gave them up because we had this was a goal to um to get this radio talk we didn't
[3:26:10.880 --> 3:26:16.560]  have uh sponsors it's scary with patriot radio and we didn't have a sponsor at the time and we
[3:26:16.560 --> 3:26:23.600]  had a chance to to get a radio spot so we didn't even sell it we gave them up uh not even you know
[3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:29.040]  thinking of that now you know hindsight we wish that we would have sold them but we were so we
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:34.320]  were so dedicated at the time because if you remember last march that's when we started to hear
[3:26:34.320 --> 3:26:39.280]  in the information about the swine flu and what was going to happen and now and we felt like we
[3:26:39.280 --> 3:26:44.400]  had to get on the ground floor so we could tell people you know not to take the shots you know
[3:26:44.400 --> 3:26:50.640]  i recognize your voice didn't you and your uh partner uh come visit me at the office we did

[3:27:10.480 --> 3:27:18.160]  talk to dr rima labo every week and it's just great but you know that first step out in faith

[3:30:24.720 --> 3:30:29.840]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[3:30:29.840 --> 3:30:35.120]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[3:30:35.120 --> 3:30:39.760]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[3:30:39.760 --> 3:30:45.120]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and

[3:33:15.760 --> 3:33:21.840]  bob explain to people what it means when they start monetizing debt i mean i'm correct in saying
[3:33:21.840 --> 3:33:28.400]  that's what we've seen in zimbabwe and we just saw that in venezuela they've been monetizing
[3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:33.600]  debt the last four years and they just devalued their currency last month by 50 percent they're
[3:33:33.600 --> 3:33:39.360]  talking about another uh... 50 percent cut next year i mean explain to people what that means
[3:33:40.720 --> 3:33:46.960]  what it means is that the fed reserve creates money out of thin air and let's say it's a trillion
[3:33:46.960 --> 3:33:54.480]  dollars and that money goes somewhere and the minute the money is used like in purchasing
[3:33:54.480 --> 3:34:04.560]  treasury bills or purchasing agency securities fanny freddy jenny and fha or uh... by buying toxic
[3:34:04.560 --> 3:34:11.200]  waste which are the bonds which contain mortgages that money goes into the system and a minute it
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:18.080]  gets used its monetization in its very inflationary and that's what happened in zimbabwe and weimar
[3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:24.160]  germany recently in venezuela uh... usually by governments that have mishandled their government
[3:34:24.160 --> 3:34:31.280]  in their finances and so what does it lead it leads to devaluation and i think there is a chance
[3:34:31.280 --> 3:34:36.800]  in the next year and a half that there could be an official devaluation of the u.s dollar
[3:34:37.920 --> 3:34:43.920]  in congruity with other nations they'd have a meeting to do that as they have in the past
[3:34:43.920 --> 3:34:49.920]  and also a debt settlement among nations probably in the order of about 30 cents on the dollar
[3:34:49.920 --> 3:34:56.000]  and i think that's coming and a lot of people say no no no no no but they're gonna have to do it
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:34:59.840]  they're not going to have any choice and we have a caller earlier saying if we get rid of the
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:04.240]  federal reserve it may devalue my money in the bank they're the ones that are doing it
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:09.040]  can the fed reserve notes are not worth the paper they're written on
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:14.240]  uh... they're they're only confidence notes in the minute the confidence is lost and that's in
[3:35:14.240 --> 3:35:18.800]  the process of happening not only here in america but all throughout europe as you've just seen
[3:35:18.800 --> 3:35:28.720]  and and so with this kind of thing will lead internationally to a multilateral devaluation
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:36.720]  perhaps of all currencies or reevaluation some currencies will go up against others but the
[3:35:36.720 --> 3:35:48.000]  key is they're all going to go down against gold because gold hasn't really gone up it's just the
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  currencies have gone down that's correct and the currencies have gone down the dollar will take as
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:36:02.720]  an example officially since nineteen eighty when gold was eight fifty it should be selling on an
[3:36:02.720 --> 3:36:09.440]  official basis vis-a-vis the inflation during that period of time about twenty four hundred
[3:36:09.440 --> 3:36:17.440]  dollars an ounce in the selling for a thousand and sixty six dollars and so the central banks have
[3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:23.520]  been responsible for the suppression of gold for the last twenty two years officially illegally
[3:36:26.880 --> 3:36:33.280]  incredible absolutely incredible bob i'm gonna let you punch out here unless you want to go
[3:36:33.280 --> 3:36:38.080]  ahead and just go all the way to the fifty and take a few more calls i'll go with you
[3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:45.360]  yeah all right bob's not punching out we always love having him um let's go ahead and talk to
[3:36:45.360 --> 3:36:52.080]  tom in arizona tom go ahead yeah i was the guy that asked the question about the uh the auctions
[3:36:52.080 --> 3:36:58.720]  that are coming up so do that answer your question yeah i just want one thing to ask bob is by
[3:36:58.720 --> 3:37:04.800]  devaluating like you just explained that means they're not going to be able to go to an auction
[3:37:04.800 --> 3:37:08.400]  with three hundred billion dollars because if they came up with an auction at three hundred billion
[3:37:08.400 --> 3:37:12.720]  that would be catastrophic i would say but they've already been buying their own auctions how many
[3:37:12.720 --> 3:37:19.680]  times that happened last year bob eighty percent of the treasury auctions were bought indirectly
[3:37:19.680 --> 3:37:25.120]  and directly by the fed reserve yeah so see sir they're already they're already doing this
[3:37:25.120 --> 3:37:30.800]  but but and that's why they want your retirement tom i appreciate your call but i mean to try to
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:37.760]  explain this for people yeah because that's old money uh to and and correct me if i'm wrong here
[3:37:37.760 --> 3:37:43.280]  looking at this but that's why the federal reserve has ordered regional and local banks
[3:37:43.280 --> 3:37:49.520]  not to loan and to in the real world actually jack up interest rates like interest rates are at zero
[3:37:49.520 --> 3:37:55.360]  but there's many credit cards above 30 now i mean this is loan sharking they they are trying to
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:38:02.080]  control inflation by making themselves flush in money to buy big instruments other banks companies
[3:38:02.080 --> 3:38:11.040]  military firms uh infrastructure but freezing and using a uh true depression in the real economy
[3:38:11.040 --> 3:38:17.360]  to try to mask that so it's a bizarre alchemy they're engaged in trying to protect their own
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:29.840]  structure at the expense of everything else is that accurate bob it certainly is see the idea of
[3:38:29.840 --> 3:38:35.920]  all of those programs like tarp and the rest of them was to make sure that the big banks brokerage
[3:38:35.920 --> 3:38:42.400]  houses insurance companies stayed in business and they used to tax payers money to do that
[3:38:42.400 --> 3:38:47.760]  that doesn't mean that those entities are solvent because they're not because they're carrying two
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:55.200]  sets of books and so they're not out of the woods and they hold the top 10 banks in new york
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:39:01.040]  holds 70 percent of the deposits of individuals in the united states so they're holding this
[3:39:01.040 --> 3:39:07.520]  hostage they think they can get away with it or as dr roberts and others have said they were
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:14.400]  planning a fleecing but this black hole is so big it even endangers their system and now
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:17.760]  the really scary thing is they're not in control bob what do you say to that
[3:39:19.600 --> 3:39:23.920]  well i think they're running fast and every time you run fast you make mistakes
[3:39:24.880 --> 3:39:32.000]  you're cutting corners and you're backing off and you're bobbing and weaving and that leads to
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:38.720]  unsound thinking and so all these dumb things you see happening is because we're pushing them and
[3:39:38.720 --> 3:39:46.800]  we've got to keep on doing it what would our situation from your studied view be if for 45
[3:39:46.800 --> 3:39:54.480]  years almost 50 bob with yourself and red beckman and uh gebert griffin and many others and the
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:40:00.480]  newer batch of patriots that popped up 15 years ago because of weiko like myself and then then
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:07.200]  now the even i mean it's exponential you guys were about you know an inch deep because there was
[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:12.640]  not very many of you then it got to be about a foot deep in the mid 90s now on scales i'd say
[3:40:12.640 --> 3:40:17.360]  we're about a thousand foot deep in patriots i mean we are and that's not an exaggeration folks
[3:40:17.360 --> 3:40:22.080]  it's just it's the hottest thing out there even mainstream media says conspiracy is taking over
[3:40:22.080 --> 3:40:28.160]  it's not conspiracy it's education it's not being idiot dumb bells who know all about sports
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:33.520]  but know nothing about all the world works there is a rediscovery because it's so dangerous to not
[3:40:33.520 --> 3:40:40.320]  be informed now where would we be if you and others 50 years ago hadn't started fighting the
[3:40:40.320 --> 3:40:45.680]  new world order bob well they would have been out of the way and we would have had a totally
[3:40:45.680 --> 3:40:51.680]  different society and people would have lived throughout the world uh much better than they
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:57.200]  are today because the people at the top wouldn't wouldn't be around stealing everything but that's
[3:40:57.200 --> 3:41:02.720]  the reverse of my question i'm sorry i wasn't clear if you and others what you've been doing
[3:41:02.720 --> 3:41:07.840]  this 48 years if you hadn't been there fighting them and in publishing books that i don't know
[3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:14.480]  five million copies or whatever went out of uh that gary allen book you published i mean i
[3:41:14.480 --> 3:41:20.720]  didn't call a conspiracy yes if how many copies of that oh there were millions of them that was
[3:41:20.720 --> 3:41:24.320]  in the seven i think it's five million yeah we used to get them printed up for five cents a piece
[3:41:24.320 --> 3:41:30.080]  that was pretty good yeah but but but i mean if you hadn't been there with tens of thousands of
[3:41:30.080 --> 3:41:37.600]  other patriots how bad would it be now oh it'd be dreadful because the the people who are learning
[3:41:37.600 --> 3:41:42.080]  and have learned safe since the 1980s wouldn't have been able to learn because we wouldn't have
[3:41:42.080 --> 3:41:50.000]  been there to help them and then i wouldn't be here probably not i mean there were congressmen
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:53.840]  and senators fighting the bankers a hundred years ago and uh 200 years ago in the time of
[3:41:53.840 --> 3:42:01.760]  andrew jackson and 235 years ago in the time of george washington but from 1900 there was an early
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:07.120]  wave then it subsided i'd say you were part of the second wave then there was a third wave i'm
[3:42:07.120 --> 3:42:11.440]  part of the third wave there's a fourth wave my god what's the fifth wave going to be bob
[3:42:12.720 --> 3:42:17.840]  it's going to be all the people that we helped to train about the truth and the knowledge that we
[3:42:17.840 --> 3:42:26.960]  need to lead to live a life of freedom and a life to its fullest and uh evidently uh
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:33.360]  we've been kind of chosen to do this kind of a job and that we like doing it so we do it
[3:42:33.360 --> 3:42:39.120]  i mean who else is 74 years old is running around like a madman like me with the exception of g
[3:42:39.120 --> 3:42:49.840]  edward griffin or red beckman 81 or or dr stan monti he's uh he's 88 i'm 78 none dare call
[3:42:49.840 --> 3:42:56.480]  a conspiracy gary allen with uh larry abraham an incredible book this is the book when i was in
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:43:02.320]  high school that really really woke me up uh and then i knew the knowledge so when i went to college
[3:43:02.320 --> 3:43:11.680]  i understood the propaganda but think about it first wave 1910 1920 or so into the 30s very small
[3:43:12.400 --> 3:43:20.960]  second wave 1950s bob Chapman and other icons of liberty uh really the blooming of that second
[3:43:20.960 --> 3:43:27.200]  wave in the 80s the huge wave in the mid 90s when i really got active but but i was at the tail end
[3:43:27.200 --> 3:43:33.120]  of that new wave and now this giant fourth wave notice bob the waves are coming faster and faster
[3:43:33.120 --> 3:43:37.840]  and getting exponentially bigger that's why the globalists are rushing and in all their white
[3:43:37.840 --> 3:43:45.680]  papers targeting us in many cases by name we are literally grappling with the new world order we
[3:43:45.680 --> 3:43:52.480]  showing the people the power of the individual bob we sure are and we're grappling not with a new
[3:43:52.480 --> 3:43:59.760]  world order with satan himself you know we ought to find out who's gotten under call conspiracy
[3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:09.360]  and buy a bunch of them this is an ancient copy right here i have about 10 copies oh man i never
[3:44:09.360 --> 3:44:17.600]  had gary sign them i've gotten more books by people and in red them and critique them and all of that
[3:44:17.600 --> 3:44:23.360]  and i never have people bother to sign them for me you were involved in the financing of the
[3:44:23.360 --> 3:44:31.200]  original publication correct yes that's correct now the number i've got on this is five million in
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:38.000]  print yeah but there was there was more than that i think they did one more printing after that
[3:44:38.800 --> 3:44:44.960]  and then uh we had a warehouse full of them and uh and so we would sell them in batches
[3:44:44.960 --> 3:44:53.280]  and uh you know a box would go out for um postage and five bucks uh uh just to spread them out you
[3:44:53.280 --> 3:44:59.760]  know we were pamphleteers we couldn't get on the radio i think uh the first one that was successful
[3:44:59.760 --> 3:45:05.920]  getting on the radio was alan stang he was on a station in glendale california and i used to go on
[3:45:05.920 --> 3:45:10.880]  with him once in a while but that was in the early 80s that was 20 years after we started and stang
[3:45:10.880 --> 3:45:17.280]  died last year use of small ones died tuesday i tell you this was a very good friend of mine as well
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:26.480]  in fact i put uh renzi's uh uh old bet into this issue for tomorrow and i put a little piece in
[3:45:26.480 --> 3:45:33.040]  myself in fact give me a document cam shot for prison planet dot tv viewers radio listeners can't
[3:45:33.040 --> 3:45:37.760]  i guess can't see this it says you can buy books yourself at quantity price and distribute them
[3:45:37.760 --> 3:45:43.840]  is described in chapter eight one copy one dollar three copies two dollars ten copies five dollars
[3:45:43.840 --> 3:45:47.600]  you guys were selling them at cost because your heart was in the right place is why it had such
[3:45:47.600 --> 3:45:56.720]  effect 25 copies ten dollars ten copies uh 100 copies 30 dollars 10 cartons uh 250 dollars so
[3:45:57.840 --> 3:46:04.320]  so all of this is going on a thousand copies for 250 bucks selling these operation counter attack
[3:46:04.320 --> 3:46:10.000]  look at this now i remember reading this book and i believe this is even the copy i had back in the
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  early 90s or i guess in the late 80s and and i remember reading this book and then years later
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:22.640]  making my first film in 97 and saying it's free basically like none dare call a conspiracy
[3:46:22.640 --> 3:46:28.480]  make copies of it and again that's why listeners need to understand now is the time to be getting
[3:46:28.480 --> 3:46:35.200]  obama deception follow the republic and end game and truth rising and the other films and books we
[3:46:35.200 --> 3:46:40.720]  produced and sell now is the time to be making copies of my films because we're into the fourth
[3:46:40.720 --> 3:46:47.040]  wave now ladies and gentlemen this is the ultimate time of awakening i mean you talk about clawing
[3:46:47.040 --> 3:46:53.760]  and scratching and battling down in the literal trenches like bob and others did 30 40 50 years ago
[3:46:53.760 --> 3:47:00.240]  now the people are ready to hear us and we're standing on the shoulders of people like bob i mean
[3:47:00.240 --> 3:47:07.440]  bob how important is it to fight back now it's for your whole life and the lives of all of the
[3:47:07.440 --> 3:47:13.360]  people you're approaching you that comes behind you because if you don't beat these people your
[3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:17.840]  children grandchildren great-gen grandchildren center are going to live in their knees they're
[3:47:17.840 --> 3:47:25.360]  going to be enslaved these people are evil and you've got to stop them you know that's the amazing
[3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:29.200]  thing bob i know you've had a lot of threats they've tried to set you up even drove drove you out of
[3:47:29.200 --> 3:47:36.400]  the country for exposing them and when i get persecuted it just lets me know how real this is
[3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:41.440]  and how important it is and then i don't even care about myself it's not even my children i realize
[3:47:41.440 --> 3:47:47.040]  how faster generations come and go i'm envisioning my children's great-grandchildren and that i want
[3:47:47.040 --> 3:47:55.440]  them to be free and i'll do anything to stop them from being slaves and people are caught up in
[3:47:55.440 --> 3:48:02.880]  american idol football things that don't matter folks when our entire humanity who we are is
[3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:09.680]  literally being destroyed right now by a scientific tyranny we can't give the world up to a bunch of
[3:48:09.680 --> 3:48:16.080]  vicious control freaks and i see all these all these hollow people who have money who have power
[3:48:16.080 --> 3:48:22.800]  and and and they're so unhappy because they've never tuned in to what it really is to be human
[3:48:22.800 --> 3:48:28.240]  and realize that we're all just part of the species and the measure of who we are and the value of
[3:48:28.240 --> 3:48:34.480]  who we are is how we empower humanity and and then once you reach this point you're not worried
[3:48:34.480 --> 3:48:38.960]  about being killed or tortured you're only worried about beating the enemy bob Chapman
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:45.840]  i agree completely and of course being older and you know you're young enough to be my son in fact
[3:48:45.840 --> 3:48:55.600]  my son's 41 years old and uh your fear leads there is no fear anymore because you know that
[3:48:55.600 --> 3:49:01.360]  your body and your mind eventually are going to break down it's the uh causation of existence as a
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:08.320]  human being and so you become freer and freer and freer and you know you walk on air they they can't
[3:49:08.320 --> 3:49:13.520]  touch you there's nothing they can do and that's the time that all of you people out there who
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:22.800]  you're in 60s and 70s and 80s should get together and do something positive and help because there's
[3:49:22.800 --> 3:49:29.760]  so many people sitting around doing nothing when they could be doing something and if you sit around
[3:49:29.760 --> 3:49:38.000]  doing nothing you're going to atrophy physically and mentally so let's help out don't turn you back
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:46.080]  on it don't be mad because you're going to die everybody has to there's no way out of this world
[3:49:46.080 --> 3:49:53.440]  except that way and so get with it yeah the world sells us a certain selfishness that being
[3:49:53.440 --> 3:49:59.040]  involved or standing up or fighting is somehow weak and that just caring about yourself and
[3:49:59.040 --> 3:50:05.040]  greedily hiding with a bunch of crap and a bunch of bobbles is success when the whole point of
[3:50:05.040 --> 3:50:10.560]  humanity is helping your tribe helping your people helping build something for the future
[3:50:10.560 --> 3:50:17.040]  because i'm going to die but my progeny are going to go on forever unless i let these people win
[3:50:17.680 --> 3:50:23.840]  and it's just if people could grasp bob what you and i grasp and this this this unchanging
[3:50:24.560 --> 3:50:31.760]  total truth we would free ourselves overnight and to see the whole world in the grip of the beast
[3:50:31.760 --> 3:50:37.840]  it's just such an illusion it's such a trance it's a host it's a it's a fraud it's a lie the
[3:50:37.840 --> 3:50:42.640]  international forecaster.com i think this is one of our best interviews ever bob have a great weekend

[3:55:35.360 --> 3:55:43.200]  and bad things he did at the end of the day he was a good man and to the listeners out there
[3:55:44.400 --> 3:55:51.040]  i have become the main symbol worldwide of resistance to the new world order the only
[3:55:51.040 --> 3:55:56.720]  other person who could rival what we've done here is ron paul and he is a great statesman
[3:55:56.720 --> 3:56:05.840]  and a good man but he's old and i have searched the world for bona fide patriots people who are real
[3:56:05.840 --> 3:56:12.000]  people who have watched for a long time and i find them with the common people i don't find them with
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:17.200]  the elitist i don't find them with the globalist i don't i don't find them even in much of the people
[3:56:17.200 --> 3:56:23.120]  that you would see as leadership against the fight against the new world order and many times i say
[3:56:23.120 --> 3:56:29.280]  i'm not cut out for this job the responsibility is too great the power i've been given is
[3:56:31.040 --> 3:56:31.600]  humbling
[3:56:35.760 --> 3:56:41.600]  yesterday i pulled into a mexican food restaurant to eat quickly i had to come back to work and work
[3:56:41.600 --> 3:56:48.160]  till late in the evening and the people at the door were listeners as i walked by the bar they
[3:56:48.160 --> 3:56:54.640]  were listeners a woman came over from a table a family came over people from new zealand
[3:56:56.240 --> 3:57:04.080]  who were there stopped and took photos with me and said new zealand is on fire with you alex jones
[3:57:09.920 --> 3:57:11.680]  i have a great responsibility
[3:57:11.680 --> 3:57:22.320]  and it is because my heart is true and i'm real and i work hard that we've had this much success
[3:57:23.840 --> 3:57:29.760]  and we go into very dark waters the enemy is moving against us on every front
[3:57:31.280 --> 3:57:35.040]  but they don't want to yet smash me because that will make me a martyr
[3:57:35.040 --> 3:57:43.040]  and i pledge this to you i will do the best job i can possibly in this weak body and this flesh
[3:57:43.040 --> 3:57:49.600]  to be a pure good person but at the end of the day that doesn't even matter because no doubt
[3:57:51.760 --> 3:57:59.120]  i will fail as many times as i succeed and i am just as worldly as the next person but
[3:57:59.120 --> 3:58:07.760]  i want to be good and i want to defeat the tyranny but through you we will defeat the new world order
[3:58:07.760 --> 3:58:13.520]  with god's help remember that it is the idea of freedom the idea of liberty the idea of
[3:58:14.240 --> 3:58:20.800]  honor and everything that is good and pure that will trump the lie and so remember the
[3:58:20.800 --> 3:58:27.760]  important mission you're on and just how serious the times are that we're in the destiny of humanity
[3:58:27.760 --> 3:58:34.320]  is being decided right now for many generations in the future our progeny will look back on this time
[3:58:36.320 --> 3:58:41.760]  as a place where humanity stood up against tyranny or as a time when we fell to total darkness
