[00:00.000 --> 00:29.840]  Here we are, right in the center of the fight.
[00:29.840 --> 00:35.800]  Live Sunday, December 18, 2022, under host Alex Jones over here for two hours and the
[00:35.800 --> 00:40.880]  great Owen Schroyer comes in till eight o'clock tonight for another live two hours on radio
[00:40.880 --> 00:47.560]  and TV stations and of course streaming out at the vaunted and embattled, battle scarred
[00:47.560 --> 00:52.680]  info wars dot com and bandod video.
[00:52.680 --> 00:55.600]  Well ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:55.600 --> 01:00.360]  He's becoming very, very clear and folks are really noticing, wow, that info wars over
[01:00.360 --> 01:03.560]  the years is really called where the world would be because we're actually studying who
[01:03.560 --> 01:08.360]  runs it, what the real plan is and cut through all of the distractions and BS, no matter
[01:08.360 --> 01:11.480]  how entertaining it is, we don't focus on it.
[01:11.480 --> 01:18.200]  Kissinger says it's time for negotiated peace in Ukraine to avoid World War three says nuclear
[01:18.200 --> 01:23.600]  war is imminent and that is definitely true and definitely a very serious issue.
[01:23.600 --> 01:28.760]  So that's the omnibudsman of the new world order saying it needs to stop.
[01:28.760 --> 01:35.280]  Meanwhile, US sends infantry unit to base just miles away from Russian border in Estonia
[01:35.280 --> 01:42.120]  and of course is moving tactical nuclear weapons in to the areas as well.
[01:42.120 --> 01:49.880]  To say that we are flirting with absolute insane disaster is a complete and utter understatement.
[01:49.880 --> 01:58.200]  We have that, then we have Twitter files part six, the FBI controls and runs Twitter, Twitter
[01:58.200 --> 02:04.160]  is an FBI subsidiary and of course Gavin Nunes and others that have been tracking this have
[02:04.160 --> 02:07.880]  pointed out what we pointed out that the other big tech groups are just as bad.
[02:07.880 --> 02:11.040]  We just haven't gotten into their documents yet but we have all the other documents that
[02:11.040 --> 02:16.000]  we've been exposing over the years that already document that completely.
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.800]  We also have dozens of cities led by El Paso, Denver and New York, the Big Apple saying
[02:23.800 --> 02:30.400]  we are in an emergency declaring an emergency.
[02:30.400 --> 02:36.480]  I've talked to internal border patrol sources high up and they said that this year was tracking
[02:36.480 --> 02:43.680]  to be 10 million illegal aliens coming into the United States.
[02:43.680 --> 02:48.760]  That's 10 million in one year and it's all directed by the United Nations, all directed
[02:48.760 --> 02:52.320]  by NGOs and I just sit here and point out that's totally illegal, the border patrol,
[02:52.320 --> 02:55.160]  we've been down to the Texas border, the Arizona border, we've shown you the footage, we've
[02:55.160 --> 03:00.040]  shown you the whistleblowers, their blurred out faces, we show you the names of the groups,
[03:00.040 --> 03:06.280]  that the UN, the same UN that NGOs that ran the collapse of Europe's borders were then
[03:06.280 --> 03:08.440]  brought in here to actually run them here.
[03:08.440 --> 03:12.520]  Well thank God, finally it seems like the Texas governor is getting his head screwed
[03:12.520 --> 03:17.120]  on straight or waking up, he's got a criminal investigation going on the NGOs and how they're
[03:17.120 --> 03:23.200]  in command of the border patrol, yes, yes, yes, they're breaking a lot of laws to do
[03:23.200 --> 03:31.520]  this and we need to have state prosecutions of that, instead of just trying to get Biden
[03:31.520 --> 03:37.440]  to do his job, still state grand juries can indict these NGOs smuggling kids with no documents
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.320]  and giving them to people, they've caught them in sex slavery, it's been in Senate reports,
[03:41.320 --> 03:47.280]  so indict them on that, indict them on the UN NGOs running the entire operation, that's
[03:47.280 --> 03:51.480]  completely illegal to have some foreign non-governmental organization with George Soros funding running
[03:51.480 --> 03:58.400]  it, we know all the names of the people, it's ridiculous, so we've got all of that, we've
[03:58.400 --> 04:01.560]  got a really out of control ruling out of the wonderful state of Connecticut, talk about
[04:01.560 --> 04:06.280]  red courts, court rules against biological females over Connecticut transgender athlete
[04:06.280 --> 04:12.080]  policy, says men will compete in basketball against women in track, in boxing, in wrestling
[04:12.080 --> 04:20.720]  and everything and so now everywhere the winners of cycling and boxing and MMA are biological
[04:20.720 --> 04:28.360]  men beating the living snot out of women, so that's coming up and then we've got all
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.080]  the economic collapse news that I don't have to tell you, we're in the middle of what the
[04:32.080 --> 04:39.960]  Federal Reserve is doing, raising these rates, the basis points on lending and more, there
[04:39.960 --> 04:44.680]  is so much happening and there could be a more critical time for M4 Wars to still be
[04:44.680 --> 04:48.200]  on air, but it's only because you're a word of mouth and you're prayer and buying products

[06:40.680 --> 06:46.960]  Jones show, I'm on the air every weekday at 11am until 3pm central then I return Sunday

[06:57.000 --> 07:02.240]  and thank you all for tuning in today, this is another incredibly important broadcast,
[07:02.240 --> 07:06.280]  I want to remind you we're in an information war and that you are the real power out there
[07:06.280 --> 07:11.480]  that when you share the local stations we're on, when you share M4Wars.com forward slash
[07:11.480 --> 07:15.280]  show, when you share the local TV stations and cable stations, when you share the articles
[07:15.280 --> 07:20.680]  and videos, it gets past the censors and changes the world, all their propaganda and censorship
[07:20.680 --> 07:28.440]  would not be necessary if resistance was futile, now I've got so much to hit here, Henry Kissinger
[07:28.440 --> 07:32.800]  is one of the top people in the New World Order, he helps set up the whole Globalist
[07:32.800 --> 07:38.320]  Program we're in right now, he is still the omnibudsman of the whole Rockefeller Rothschild
[07:38.320 --> 07:42.840]  Combine, he came out and said we've got to have a peace deal right now or the Russians
[07:42.840 --> 07:46.040]  are going to go to nuclear war and this thing has escalated out of control, that's a true
[07:46.040 --> 07:50.240]  statement so we're going to get to that, we've got a bunch of different mayors around the
[07:50.240 --> 07:55.040]  country declaring an emergency over the border completely collapsing at the end of Title
[07:55.040 --> 08:01.960]  42, now past those getting 14,500 illegals a day, they're just sleeping on the streets,
[08:01.960 --> 08:07.400]  they're everywhere, 14,000 plus people a day, many of them little children who are not with
[08:07.400 --> 08:12.120]  their parents, there's been some big breakthroughs on criminal investigations in Texas on who's
[08:12.120 --> 08:16.520]  running this and we're very close to grand jury indictments, just like you've seen in
[08:16.520 --> 08:22.720]  Florida, now with the state level grand juries investigating the drug companies lying about
[08:22.720 --> 08:28.920]  their poison shots, so that's really, really, really, really good, important news, we've
[08:28.920 --> 08:33.480]  got Twitter files, Twitter is an FBI subsidiary, show the other big tech companies, we've got
[08:33.480 --> 08:39.600]  news on that, we've got globalist coups around the world in places like Peru and Brazil,
[08:39.600 --> 08:45.400]  we've got Bill Gates announcing more plans for depopulation operations, we've got so
[08:45.400 --> 08:53.200]  much to cover here tonight, but the first thing I wanted to hit because what you see
[08:53.200 --> 08:56.360]  happening in Canada, what you see happening in New Zealand, what you see happening in
[08:56.360 --> 09:01.880]  Germany or the UK is all run by the globalist, all run by the WEF, all run by the UN and
[09:01.880 --> 09:05.840]  they're baited tests for what's coming here, we have a tendency to say well I don't care
[09:05.840 --> 09:11.120]  what's happening over there, it's not happening here, well it's coming here, just like a decade
[09:11.120 --> 09:19.080]  ago the UN hired NGOs and set up giant refugee centers on the borders of Europe to bring
[09:19.080 --> 09:26.520]  in over 15 million Middle Easterners, Africans and others into Europe and now tourism is
[09:26.520 --> 09:34.520]  down 80%, everything's wrecked, there's just crime everywhere, open defecating in the roads,
[09:34.520 --> 09:41.240]  just massive, massive crime, no-go zones all over the place, I mean I've been to Europe
[09:41.240 --> 09:45.280]  recently and it's just wrecked and I've talked to families that's been to places like Paris,
[09:45.280 --> 09:50.120]  I mean it looks like an open toilet with just trash everywhere and just people just lounging
[09:50.120 --> 09:56.680]  around all over, it just goes on and on and now you see that with our border, completely
[09:56.680 --> 10:01.840]  wide open, Biden saying if I get elected immediately, surge the border, you see how just a few
[10:01.840 --> 10:06.560]  years later the same thing that happened to Europe is happening to us, so when we look
[10:06.560 --> 10:13.640]  at these stories understand that this is a beta test, so I wanted to hit this first,
[10:13.640 --> 10:19.160]  it's coming out in mainstream news that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine causes blood clots, microcarditis
[10:19.160 --> 10:23.280]  and heart attacks, I got a stack of mainstream news admitting that we told you years ago,
[10:23.280 --> 10:28.960]  but here it is, but the UN has said going back two and a half years ago that during
[10:28.960 --> 10:33.600]  future lockdowns they're going to arrest people that are against the lockdowns and put them
[10:33.600 --> 10:39.040]  in the COVID camps and the UK's announced that, Canada's announced that, Australia's
[10:39.040 --> 10:42.800]  announced that, they're all British Commonwealths you notice, never got out from under the
[10:42.800 --> 10:49.320]  crown and that same globalist system wants to bring that here and so when you see these
[10:49.320 --> 10:56.060]  chilling, chilling reports by these Orwellian even looking people, they just look like super
[10:56.060 --> 11:04.880]  villains, New Zealand goes full 1984, tells public to report political dissidents as terrorists
[11:04.880 --> 11:09.400]  and they say people that don't want to take the shots or have lockdowns, well what is
[11:09.400 --> 11:16.720]  in Biden's June 2001, new national terrorism directive, counter terrorism directive, he
[11:16.720 --> 11:21.400]  says not being for lockdowns, not being for shots, not being for force injections, questioning
[11:21.400 --> 11:27.840]  elections or questioning open borders or later they released new documents a month ago,
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.760]  questioning military operations, you can't protest or be against the hasty withdrawal
[11:33.760 --> 11:39.520]  from Afghanistan or be against the Ukraine, you know, potential nuclear war.
[11:39.520 --> 11:45.560]  So this is the criminalization of dissent, I've got a bunch of clips in Canada, in New
[11:45.560 --> 11:50.840]  Zealand, in Australia where they're saying we have a digital new casual society based
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.000]  on your vaccine passport, which are trying to roll out here as well.
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.320]  And we're going to basically spy on you and arrest you and have your neighbors watch you
[12:00.320 --> 12:05.320]  if you protest lockdowns, and then of course Tulsi Gabbard goes into it in great detail
[12:05.320 --> 12:13.000]  and just eviscerates Trudeau up in Canada, who again is the top WEF minion, Schwab says
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.200]  he's the greatest example of what they want for every nation as they take our quote, cabinets
[12:17.200 --> 12:19.720]  over as they penetrate the cabinets.
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.160]  So let's just play these back to back, here's New Zealand goes full 1984, then Australia
[12:24.160 --> 12:29.720]  digital ID link vaccine verification certificates, no vaccines, you lose everything, bank accounts,
[12:29.720 --> 12:31.560]  mobile networks, internet access.
[12:31.560 --> 12:36.320]  And then of course we got Tulsi Gabbard's will play back to back here as well, where
[12:36.320 --> 12:41.560]  she pulls no punches in her assessment of autocratic Justin Trudeau, here it is.
[12:41.560 --> 12:46.000]  Our secret services launching an initiative to help us identify people who may have been
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  radicalized.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.840]  No, the science details dozens of indicators that a friend or family member could be planning
[12:51.840 --> 12:53.520]  a terror attack.
[12:53.520 --> 12:58.280]  As Adam Hollingworth reports, the move comes as our spy chiefs identify a new and worrying
[12:58.280 --> 13:00.600]  type of terrorism.
[13:00.600 --> 13:05.480]  Time was when the intelligence services were never seen, never heard, but now they're
[13:05.480 --> 13:11.240]  loudly proclaiming your country needs you to keep an eye on those you know and if necessary
[13:11.240 --> 13:12.240]  dot them in.
[13:12.240 --> 13:17.840]  Recognizing a potential warning sign and then alerting into this AIS or police could be
[13:17.840 --> 13:21.760]  the vital piece in the puzzle that ultimately saves lives.
[13:21.760 --> 13:27.240]  To that end they're publishing a guide called know the signs to help us all identify potential
[13:27.240 --> 13:29.160]  terrorists in our midst.
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.840]  To pay attention if they are and to be alert so that if they see or hear about something
[13:34.840 --> 13:40.720]  that seems off that worries them and concerns them they might have a look at this information
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.320]  to say does this indicate to me that this person is on the road to actually committing
[13:45.320 --> 13:46.320]  an attack.
[13:46.320 --> 13:51.760]  The SIS has listed around 50 signs from obvious ones like writing on a weapon as happened
[13:51.760 --> 13:52.760]  in Christchurch.
[13:52.760 --> 13:58.600]  A person who is really developing an us versus them world view.
[13:58.600 --> 14:03.240]  Authorities say they're usually closely monitoring 40 to 50 potential terrorists.
[14:03.240 --> 14:08.080]  These people used to be motivated by their white identity or by their faith, but in the
[14:08.080 --> 14:12.960]  past six months a third group has emerged, those motivated by politics.
[14:12.960 --> 14:16.560]  And so it could be the COVID measures that the government took and so it could be the
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.960]  COVID measures that the government took or it could be other policies that are interpreted
[14:20.960 --> 14:28.080]  as infringing on rights and what I sometimes describe as a kind of hot mess of ideologies
[14:28.080 --> 14:33.520]  and beliefs fuelled by conspiracy theories, fuelled by conspiracy theories.
[14:33.520 --> 14:38.240]  The launch of the initiative know the signs is an indicator that the security services
[14:38.240 --> 14:42.560]  know that they can't do it alone, they need the help of the public.
[14:42.560 --> 14:45.480]  But to some the guide is a first step only.
[14:45.480 --> 14:51.880]  How do we upskill those people in our community who are much closer to people who might be
[14:51.880 --> 14:56.720]  potentially radicalized and get them to understand what it is they're seeing?
[14:56.720 --> 14:57.720]  That's our challenge.
[14:57.720 --> 14:59.000]  Adam Hollingworth, News Hub.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.120]  So they're coming at you with forced injections worldwide that a racial immune system give
[15:03.120 --> 15:09.280]  you heart attacks, cancer, infertility and the literal security chief in New Zealand looks
[15:09.280 --> 15:14.080]  like Dr. Ebel's assistant like a dead ringer.
[15:14.080 --> 15:18.720]  I mean you can't even make this up.
[15:18.720 --> 15:26.000]  Look at how Klaus Schwab looks like Blofeld, he even dresses like him, they're doing it
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.360]  to throw it in your face.
[15:29.360 --> 15:34.800]  They're going full tyranny ladies and gentlemen and saying it's a good thing and watching
[15:34.800 --> 15:39.360]  mass.com syndrome be triggered as the minions all get in line to submit to it.
[15:39.360 --> 15:40.360]  Why are they doing this?
[15:40.360 --> 15:44.440]  Is they're getting ready to shut off the world economy, ready to shut off the fuel and just
[15:44.440 --> 15:45.440]  depopulate?
[15:45.440 --> 15:50.200]  I mean 90% of the people going along with this that are thinking they're on the winning
[15:50.200 --> 15:52.200]  team will be destroyed themselves as well.
[15:52.200 --> 16:00.120]  I'm going to come back and play the casual society club and more when we come back.
[16:00.120 --> 16:03.840]  Ladies and gentlemen we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[16:03.840 --> 16:08.960]  of Infowars under a new brand name Infowars Platinum.
[16:08.960 --> 16:13.680]  Now all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number
[16:13.680 --> 16:18.720]  one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[16:18.720 --> 16:23.000]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan and they've given
[16:23.000 --> 16:30.720]  us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[16:30.720 --> 16:35.560]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other
[16:35.560 --> 16:37.760]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[16:37.760 --> 16:42.320]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[16:42.320 --> 16:44.200]  We're talking about Payne MD.
[16:44.200 --> 16:46.880]  We're talking about HGH max boost.
[16:46.880 --> 16:49.760]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[16:49.760 --> 16:51.360]  These things are incredible.
[16:51.360 --> 16:55.480]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your healthcare
[16:55.480 --> 16:57.480]  provider because they're so powerful.
[16:57.480 --> 17:00.600]  Get them at infowarsstore.com.
[17:00.600 --> 17:05.480]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the Globals.
[17:05.480 --> 17:12.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America but the world.
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.520]  We are engaging the Globals at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[17:17.520 --> 17:18.520]  deserve the credit.
[17:18.520 --> 17:19.520]  Yes, I've persevered.
[17:19.520 --> 17:26.040]  But the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason we've had the success.
[17:26.040 --> 17:31.440]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war we've ever had.
[17:31.440 --> 17:38.160]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[17:38.160 --> 17:42.120]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[17:42.120 --> 17:44.960]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[17:44.960 --> 17:45.960]  God bless you all.
[17:45.960 --> 17:46.960]  I salute you.
[17:46.960 --> 17:47.960]  I thank you.
[17:47.960 --> 17:53.320]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history
[17:53.320 --> 17:54.320]  is happening.
[17:54.320 --> 17:55.320]  The fight is my fight.
[17:55.320 --> 17:56.320]  It's your fight.
[17:56.320 --> 17:57.320]  It's our fight.
[17:57.320 --> 17:59.320]  God bless you all.
[17:59.320 --> 18:04.680]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[18:04.680 --> 18:09.640]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[18:09.640 --> 18:15.280]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[18:15.280 --> 18:20.880]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, that made
[18:20.880 --> 18:26.760]  any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support Info Wars despite the massive
[18:26.760 --> 18:32.640]  lawfare being waged against Info Wars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[18:32.640 --> 18:37.880]  Info Wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[18:37.880 --> 18:43.360]  lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps Info Wars on the air and what that does
[18:43.360 --> 18:48.920]  is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[18:48.920 --> 18:55.000]  So continue to do it, go to places like InfoWarsStore.com, go to places like Save Info Wars, continue
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.480]  to keep Info Wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[19:00.480 --> 19:07.200]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[19:07.200 --> 19:11.800]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[19:11.800 --> 19:16.240]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[19:16.240 --> 19:21.080]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[19:21.080 --> 19:24.680]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[19:24.680 --> 19:31.480]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3 but if you're not getting
[19:31.480 --> 19:36.560]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[19:36.560 --> 19:39.400]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[19:39.400 --> 19:43.360]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[19:43.360 --> 19:48.040]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload
[19:48.040 --> 19:54.320]  into your body for 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com with promo code 1776.
[19:54.320 --> 20:01.320]  That way support the InfoWars and your immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at InfoWarsStore.com.
[20:25.320 --> 20:31.440]  Alright, let me finish up with the UN Global Corporate Government System and what we're
[20:31.440 --> 20:37.200]  seeing in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, it's all the same program, all UN
[20:37.200 --> 20:43.360]  run, all UN certified, just other areas are a few years ahead of us and if they get this
[20:43.360 --> 20:48.040]  central bank digital currency tied to your social credit score and the basis of which
[20:48.040 --> 20:55.240]  is the vaccine ID system, they're going to control every fast of your life in their
[20:55.240 --> 20:58.640]  own words and force injections on you.
[20:58.640 --> 21:04.640]  This is everything in the fight against this program and we've got a good chance of stopping
[21:04.640 --> 21:10.360]  it especially here in the US if we simply only become aware of it but that's why they've
[21:10.360 --> 21:14.360]  got the massive censorship, that's why they've got the AI control, that's why they're trying
[21:14.360 --> 21:18.800]  to shut down anybody talking about this information, that's why Elon Musk can bring back all these
[21:18.800 --> 21:22.440]  other journalists to people because they're not really talking about the big issues, they're
[21:22.440 --> 21:27.440]  talking about political distractions even if they're conservative but we are hammering
[21:27.440 --> 21:31.840]  the heart of the matter and that's because we're over the target.
[21:31.840 --> 21:36.240]  So I pledge you New Zealand's head of the secret service saying if you don't want to
[21:36.240 --> 21:40.120]  take the shots or don't like lockdowns, you're a terrorist.
[21:40.120 --> 21:47.960]  That's being set up globally, Biden has said that officially but here's a clip in Australia
[21:47.960 --> 21:52.000]  of the digital ID linked to vaccine verification which I told you two and a half years ago
[21:52.000 --> 21:57.080]  would be the plan because the Rockefeller Foundation, Bill Gates of the UN said they
[21:57.080 --> 22:00.960]  were doing it and guess who developed the actual software and the program of the QR
[22:00.960 --> 22:06.160]  code they've already adopted, the Communist Party of China, the CCP.
[22:06.160 --> 22:10.680]  You can't make this up folks, I know most listeners are like yeah I was told this literally
[22:10.680 --> 22:14.120]  a thousand times but it's here now.
[22:14.120 --> 22:18.480]  So here is the clip out of Australia.
[22:18.480 --> 22:23.000]  COVID vaccination could become our future ticket to international travel and possibly
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.040]  even determine where you can shop or eat.
[22:26.040 --> 22:28.440]  So how do you prove you've had it?
[22:28.440 --> 22:32.880]  Nines the owner, Willem explains.
[22:32.880 --> 22:38.040]  Once you get a COVID-19 jab you can access your vaccination certificate in four ways
[22:38.040 --> 22:43.360]  through the vaccine provider, the Express Plus Medicare app, by contacting services
[22:43.360 --> 22:48.760]  Australia or by logging into your MyGov account and visiting Medicare where you'll find it
[22:48.760 --> 22:54.280]  on the Australian Immunisation Registry and to make that process more secure the government
[22:54.280 --> 22:59.560]  has now linked MyGov to the nation's digital ID system, MyGov ID.
[22:59.560 --> 23:03.640]  And of course the vaccination certificate that will be available for Australians will
[23:03.640 --> 23:10.280]  be available through MyGov and digital identity is the safest, easiest way to access MyGov.
[23:10.280 --> 23:15.120]  The digital ID isn't just for downloading your vaccination certificate, it can currently
[23:15.120 --> 23:20.120]  be used to access 75 government services online and the plan is to expand it to the
[23:20.120 --> 23:24.840]  private sector so that you can use it to check your bank details or your electricity bill.
[23:24.840 --> 23:29.680]  It replaces the traditional 100 point ID check that you'd usually do at a bank or Australia
[23:29.680 --> 23:30.680]  post.
[23:30.680 --> 23:36.080]  Well if you want a quick, simple interaction with a government service you can use your
[23:36.080 --> 23:39.200]  digital ID rather than presenting physical ID.
[23:39.200 --> 23:43.640]  Two million Australians have signed up for a digital identity and the government wants
[23:43.640 --> 23:49.560]  more people to do it as the vaccination program ramps up to ensure your details are more secure
[23:49.560 --> 23:52.880]  and you're the only person who can access your certificate.
[23:52.880 --> 23:53.880]  Fiona, thank you.
[23:53.880 --> 23:57.040]  You're the only person who can access the certificate even though you're going to be
[23:57.040 --> 24:02.000]  using it to leave your house, let's leave it out to Australia, go to the mall or go
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.280]  to your job or drive your car, get on a plane.
[24:04.280 --> 24:08.320]  Oh, it's so secure, it's so wonderful, it's so great.
[24:08.320 --> 24:12.720]  Here's Tulsi Gabbards pulls no punches in their assessment of autocratic Justin Trudeau who
[24:12.720 --> 24:17.880]  again says he wants to be a dictator and admires dictatorship and works directly for the World
[24:17.880 --> 24:18.880]  Economic Forum.
[24:18.880 --> 24:21.120]  He's trying to put Canada into this as well.
[24:21.120 --> 24:27.680]  Italy's putting it in the first country in the EU, it's happening now, here it is.
[24:27.680 --> 24:33.040]  Basically what they're telling us is you are an enemy of the state if you depose or even
[24:33.040 --> 24:38.720]  question the President, his administration or his policies, shut up, step back, fall
[24:38.720 --> 24:44.160]  in line or we're coming after you.
[24:44.160 --> 24:50.640]  This isn't some theory, this is reality and this is a reality we're seeing play out in
[24:50.640 --> 24:52.640]  Canada as we speak.
[24:52.640 --> 25:02.040]  You have the autocratic leader in Canada who's resorted to genuinely authoritarian and tyrannical
[25:02.040 --> 25:08.480]  means to suppress a peaceful mass protest against the power elite there.
[25:08.480 --> 25:12.720]  Everything that we see happening up north, everything from the execution of emergency
[25:12.720 --> 25:18.400]  powers to the freezing of bank accounts, the seizure of children from parents, the destruction
[25:18.400 --> 25:25.960]  of livelihoods and small businesses, all of these things could happen here.
[25:25.960 --> 25:34.520]  So the question I ask myself in confronting all this is what are they so afraid of?
[25:34.520 --> 25:39.520]  Who are they afraid of?
[25:39.520 --> 25:42.600]  You know the answer, it's simple.
[25:42.600 --> 25:45.480]  They're afraid of us.
[25:45.480 --> 25:49.520]  They're afraid of a free people.
[25:49.520 --> 25:53.680]  They're afraid of a free society.
[25:53.680 --> 25:58.880]  I've got to believe that Thomas Jefferson was thinking about these cowardly fearful
[25:58.880 --> 26:08.280]  leaders when he said they prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty.
[26:08.280 --> 26:14.440]  They're afraid of the freedom that empowers each and every one of us to seek the truth,
[26:14.440 --> 26:19.480]  to speak freely, to question their decisions and their authority.
[26:19.480 --> 26:24.440]  They're afraid of losing power, knowing full well the intent of our founders when they
[26:24.440 --> 26:29.680]  wrote in the Declaration of Independence that governments are instituted among men, deriving
[26:29.680 --> 26:34.360]  their just powers from the consent of the governed, and that whenever any form of government
[26:34.360 --> 26:41.720]  becomes destructive of these ends, it's the right of the people to alter or abolish it
[26:41.720 --> 26:46.960]  and institute a new government.
[26:46.960 --> 26:51.360]  But instead the big megabags of corporations through the UN and through the media are taking
[26:51.360 --> 26:55.040]  over society.
[26:55.040 --> 26:56.040]  This is here.
[26:56.040 --> 26:57.040]  This is happening.
[26:57.040 --> 27:00.480]  And they don't want the public to see these type of articles.
[27:00.480 --> 27:03.840]  Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine linked to blood clotting, FDA.
[27:03.840 --> 27:09.000]  It's an epic times article linking right to the FDA admitting okay, it does cause heart
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.720]  attacks and blood clotting.
[27:10.720 --> 27:13.840]  Case closed.
[27:13.840 --> 27:18.280]  Baby given vaccinated blood infusion dies within days, a blood clot.
[27:18.280 --> 27:19.280]  That's in the U.S.
[27:19.280 --> 27:25.680]  30 years ago, Dr. Robert Wilner accused Fauci of genocide during the HIV crisis.
[27:25.680 --> 27:30.320]  It's the same story over and over again.
[27:30.320 --> 27:32.040]  And why are they doing this?
[27:32.040 --> 27:36.120]  Because they're getting ready to pop the giant Ponzi bubble they've used to shut down all
[27:36.120 --> 27:42.920]  the other industries to shut down their competition and then to use the trillions they've stolen
[27:42.920 --> 27:48.880]  to submit and complete their power takeover.
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.760]  And once they get us in the next position, hell will be released.
[27:53.760 --> 27:55.320]  You think things are bad now?
[27:55.320 --> 27:58.280]  You'll look back on this as a good time.
[27:58.280 --> 28:01.400]  And a lot of folks are fatalistic and say, well, I just, I'm not going to oppose it.
[28:01.400 --> 28:05.800]  Well, you will oppose it and people will oppose it once it gets bad enough.
[28:05.800 --> 28:09.560]  So everything we do now affects what they call the battle space for the mind and the
[28:09.560 --> 28:11.120]  future.
[28:11.120 --> 28:14.400]  Everything we do now will have huge effects in the future because people will remember
[28:14.400 --> 28:15.400]  what they were told.
[28:15.400 --> 28:16.400]  They'll remember they were warned.
[28:16.400 --> 28:20.240]  They'll remember we laid it all out as they've already seen what we laid out in the past
[28:20.240 --> 28:21.240]  coming true.
[28:21.240 --> 28:25.360]  And then folks will understand, oh, submitting this time only makes it worse.
[28:25.360 --> 28:26.840]  They actually want to kill me.
[28:26.840 --> 28:27.840]  They already populate me.
[28:27.840 --> 28:32.560]  They want people so poor, so censored, show shut down that when they're burying people
[28:32.560 --> 28:36.200]  all around you, which they're already doing, but it's much worse, people just say, well,
[28:36.200 --> 28:40.320]  you better shut up and they'll come take you away.
[28:40.320 --> 28:43.600]  The attacks coming through the medical system and the economic system.
[28:43.600 --> 28:47.640]  And if you accept this digital straight jacket of big tech, it's over for you.
[28:47.640 --> 28:53.440]  All right, we got the big economic news, the big Russian news, the big censorship news,
[28:53.440 --> 29:00.120]  and the big emergency news on the border straight ahead.
[29:00.120 --> 29:03.480]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[29:03.480 --> 29:08.080]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics,
[29:08.080 --> 29:13.840]  the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[29:13.840 --> 29:19.640]  But through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the
[29:19.640 --> 29:21.160]  globalists have done.
[29:21.160 --> 29:25.400]  And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer
[29:25.400 --> 29:26.400]  now.
[29:26.400 --> 29:28.680]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[29:28.680 --> 29:34.800]  It's InfoWars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[29:34.800 --> 29:39.000]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.520]  exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoWars Platinum at
[29:44.520 --> 29:46.400]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[29:57.920 --> 29:59.640]  the InfoWars.
[29:59.640 --> 30:04.760]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support InfoWars and
[30:04.760 --> 30:05.760]  band.video.
[30:05.760 --> 30:10.080]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you, I'm going to do that right now.
[30:10.080 --> 30:16.120]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how many people
[30:16.120 --> 30:21.200]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[30:21.200 --> 30:25.120]  pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[30:25.120 --> 30:29.640]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and
[30:29.640 --> 30:33.720]  I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[30:33.720 --> 30:38.480]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super
[30:38.480 --> 30:39.480]  Tim Cass IRL.
[30:39.480 --> 30:45.520]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you
[30:45.520 --> 30:47.680]  don't know what you have until it's gone.
[30:47.680 --> 30:52.400]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support
[30:52.400 --> 30:59.760]  Infowars, leave a donation right now, don't wait until they're gone.
[30:59.760 --> 31:05.240]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[31:05.240 --> 31:12.120]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post COVID world where
[31:12.120 --> 31:17.640]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[31:40.720 --> 31:42.520]  care.
[31:42.520 --> 31:49.480]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media and health
[31:49.480 --> 31:50.720]  advice.

[32:00.720 --> 32:04.240]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line in Forrest M.D.
[32:04.240 --> 32:09.360]  Now, in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all
[32:09.360 --> 32:14.680]  of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to
[32:14.680 --> 32:17.280]  twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[32:17.280 --> 32:19.720]  These are high end, these are the very best.
[32:19.720 --> 32:21.800]  You know our body's ultimate tumor formula is amazing?
[32:21.800 --> 32:22.800]  Well, guess what?
[32:22.800 --> 32:29.560]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price, CBD oil of
[32:29.560 --> 32:36.160]  the highest quality, up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high quality
[32:36.160 --> 32:43.200]  full spectrum CBD and it goes on for all the new M4WarsMD products at M4WarsStore.com.
[32:43.200 --> 32:50.360]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases
[32:50.360 --> 33:01.040]  100% lower than what they're sold for in stores, M4WarsMD at M4WarsStore.com.
[33:01.040 --> 33:13.040]  Waging a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:13.040 --> 33:19.440]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:19.440 --> 33:32.320]  the M4WarsMD.
[33:32.320 --> 33:37.080]  All right, we're going to look at the emergencies declared across the country as the border
[33:37.080 --> 33:41.320]  has completely dissolved and what that really means, what the next phase of that's going
[33:41.320 --> 33:42.320]  to be.
[33:42.320 --> 33:47.120]  But there is some good news, folks are listening to this broadcast and that's really what's
[33:47.120 --> 33:52.920]  happening and the governor of Texas understands that crimes are being committed, that they
[33:52.920 --> 33:56.880]  can prosecute, that are also crimes at the state level and we're waiting for the grand
[33:56.880 --> 34:00.880]  juries to come to their own aid, to the American people's aid and do the right thing.
[34:00.880 --> 34:06.520]  You see the governor getting new grand juries set up at the state level in Florida for the
[34:06.520 --> 34:12.920]  poison shots, but the same thing is now being announced in Texas by the governor with the
[34:12.920 --> 34:13.920]  open borders.
[34:13.920 --> 34:15.440]  We'll explain that here in a moment.
[34:15.440 --> 34:17.760]  But first, let me talk about this, okay?
[34:17.760 --> 34:22.360]  I'm at peace with this and I've learned a lot of the factors that are going on out
[34:22.360 --> 34:32.080]  there and I need listeners to understand that I don't want to prove to you the fact that
[34:32.080 --> 34:37.720]  we don't have extra money like the media says we do by us shutting down or me canceling
[34:37.720 --> 34:45.240]  Owen's show and canceling American Journal, which I'm not going to do right now, but the
[34:45.240 --> 34:52.600]  point is that the facts of not having the money will do that in the near future and
[34:52.600 --> 34:56.440]  then this show, as you know it, will no longer be here, all right?
[34:56.440 --> 35:04.120]  So I hate to tell folks the details because it lets the enemy know what's successful.
[35:04.120 --> 35:09.040]  They've already been successful and so I'm just going to go ahead and tell you, okay?
[35:09.040 --> 35:14.040]  When they got up four months ago at that rig trial in Texas for the Sandy Hook thing and
[35:14.040 --> 35:19.080]  had their financial expert on who had all our documents, had our financials knew the
[35:19.080 --> 35:31.400]  truth and he said, Alex Jones is worth $160 million and Info Wars is worth more than $200
[35:31.400 --> 35:32.400]  million.
[35:32.400 --> 35:38.120]  Immediately, we saw a decline in people buying products and supporting and I've talked to
[35:38.120 --> 35:42.120]  folks on the street who go, well, I support you, but man, there's no way they just made
[35:42.120 --> 35:43.120]  that up.
[35:43.120 --> 35:44.120]  That's $100 million.
[35:44.120 --> 35:48.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have less than $300,000 personally.
[35:48.080 --> 35:50.680]  I don't have a bunch of hidden stuff.
[35:50.680 --> 35:51.800]  I don't have anything.
[35:51.800 --> 35:52.800]  It's not true.
[35:52.800 --> 35:54.800]  I didn't set this up to try to just make money.
[35:54.800 --> 36:00.760]  I don't mind having nice things, but the mission is fighting the globalist and doing
[36:00.760 --> 36:06.120]  everything we can to be a platform for all of the voices that need to be heard.
[36:06.120 --> 36:09.880]  Like Dr. Peter McCullis said last week, he said we were instrumental in this breakthrough
[36:09.880 --> 36:15.720]  in exposing the poison shots and this broadcast has saved countless lives and that's not just
[36:15.720 --> 36:16.720]  me.
[36:16.720 --> 36:17.720]  It's not just the crew.
[36:17.720 --> 36:18.720]  It's not just the listeners or the guests.
[36:18.720 --> 36:19.720]  It's all of us together.
[36:19.720 --> 36:27.560]  So their lies about how I made $60 million last year or I've got all hundreds of millions
[36:27.560 --> 36:33.080]  of dollars have been somewhat effective and it's really sad because I'll be in a grocery
[36:33.080 --> 36:38.560]  store or I'll be in a gas station and I've always had women hit on me here and there,
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.080]  you know, especially when I was younger and really good looking, but I mean, it's like
[36:42.080 --> 36:46.240]  crazy now at the grocery store anywhere, gorgeous women come over and they just get all over
[36:46.240 --> 36:51.880]  me and start grabbing on me and they say, you know, I didn't know you were a billionaire
[36:51.880 --> 36:55.640]  because the way the public works is they hear, oh, billion dollar judgments.
[36:55.640 --> 36:58.480]  Well, I mean, this guy must have billions of dollars.
[36:58.480 --> 37:00.560]  It's insane.
[37:00.560 --> 37:02.320]  It's totally insane.
[37:02.320 --> 37:07.920]  People think I'm a billionaire on the street now.
[37:07.920 --> 37:13.960]  And they think I have all this money because they got up in court and said he has $400
[37:13.960 --> 37:17.760]  plus million dollars and it was just totally lies.
[37:17.760 --> 37:19.360]  We weren't even allowed to counter it.
[37:19.360 --> 37:20.480]  We weren't allowed to have witnesses.
[37:20.480 --> 37:23.760]  They just put them on.
[37:23.760 --> 37:29.680]  So that's where I'm at here is, is just so frustrated by the level of lies because people
[37:29.680 --> 37:34.200]  expect, well, part of its lies, but, you know, they say he's worth $400 million.
[37:34.200 --> 37:36.160]  Maybe he's worth $50 million.
[37:36.160 --> 37:39.880]  You know, folks, I'm out of money and I, and I don't care about the money.
[37:39.880 --> 37:44.520]  I care about staying on air, keeping this crew employed and the fact that they're trying
[37:44.520 --> 37:48.960]  to crush us more than anybody because we've got their number and know how to stop them.
[37:48.960 --> 37:54.760]  And the even bigger frustration is this, we make it so easy to support the broadcast.
[37:54.760 --> 37:56.080]  Take vitamin mineral fusion.
[37:56.080 --> 37:59.880]  It's all the essential vitamins, the ones you got to have to live, all the essential minerals
[37:59.880 --> 38:05.400]  and key amino acids taste great, great for all ages, put a scoop and a whole pitcher
[38:05.400 --> 38:08.760]  and then it lasts for you and your family to think how big your family is three, four
[38:08.760 --> 38:09.760]  days or a week.
[38:09.760 --> 38:13.120]  You have a cup in the morning, have a cup in the evening, everything you need.
[38:13.120 --> 38:14.120]  And it's amazing.
[38:14.120 --> 38:16.000]  So good for your immune system.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.120]  It's massively discounted.
[38:17.120 --> 38:18.320]  It's going to sell out soon.
[38:18.320 --> 38:23.080]  I'm keeping it discounted at infowordsword.com because you need it and it's a great product
[38:23.080 --> 38:25.600]  and it is what people are buying.
[38:25.600 --> 38:29.200]  But people are so used to be only selling stuff on sale, wouldn't even make that much money
[38:29.200 --> 38:30.200]  when we do sell it.
[38:30.200 --> 38:33.600]  So we got to sell a lot of it to stay on air.
[38:33.600 --> 38:37.800]  So you need vitamin mineral fusion, get it, don't wait, just make the decision to keep
[38:37.800 --> 38:40.480]  us on air because listen, the globalists can't shut us down.
[38:40.480 --> 38:44.600]  They can kill me or put me in prison, but short of that, they can't shut us down.
[38:44.600 --> 38:50.240]  Only you can buy into their psyops and believe the lie.
[38:50.240 --> 38:55.480]  Now the great news is I'm in personal bankruptcy and in the next, starting tomorrow at a hearing
[38:55.480 --> 39:00.040]  and in the next week under penalty of perjury, all my stuff's filed and people are going
[39:00.040 --> 39:07.320]  to go, whoa, Alex Jones has less than $300,000 and Alex Jones, you know, drives a pickup
[39:07.320 --> 39:14.280]  truck and Alex Jones doesn't have all this money and the media is going to try to spend
[39:14.280 --> 39:16.520]  that however they do and, you know, put out more lies.
[39:16.520 --> 39:17.840]  I'm not worried about that.
[39:17.840 --> 39:22.640]  Just listeners who I know love the broadcast need to go to infowordsword.com, need to sign
[39:22.640 --> 39:26.800]  up for auto ship to get additional 10% off for your next order and need to commit to
[39:26.800 --> 39:28.760]  get these products that you already need.
[39:28.760 --> 39:32.440]  And I know we got rid of all the t-shirts and ran out of funds to even have a little
[39:32.440 --> 39:37.280]  extra stuff like books and DVDs and t-shirts because we don't have money to even buy that
[39:37.280 --> 39:38.280]  out in the future.
[39:38.280 --> 39:41.480]  And we put aside a little bit of money to go out with a couple of really cool t-shirts
[39:41.480 --> 39:42.480]  next year.
[39:42.480 --> 39:47.720]  We got some other products coming in next year, but we also launched the whole info wars
[39:47.720 --> 39:52.160]  MD line that is all a bunch of cloned copies of already number one and top best sellers
[39:52.160 --> 39:57.720]  in the country, ready to be shipped out to you and it's of the highest quality.
[39:57.720 --> 40:03.240]  I could put out some crap and mark it up a bunch and fix our problems, but I just cannot
[40:03.240 --> 40:09.840]  bring myself to bring you a product like DNA force plus or tumor 95 or libido rx or full
[40:09.840 --> 40:18.080]  spectrum CBD, which doesn't get you high, that's no, no HTC or whatever it's called
[40:18.080 --> 40:21.960]  that's got the stuff that makes you high in marijuana.
[40:21.960 --> 40:26.240]  It's only got the good stuff that's great for your joints and your whole body.
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.080]  It just does amazing things for pain and more.
[40:29.080 --> 40:31.200]  That's about to sell out because they only had a limited supply of it.
[40:31.200 --> 40:36.880]  We only had a limited run of it, but it's all available and it really is up to you.
[40:36.880 --> 40:40.000]  You have to decide whether the globalists are going to win.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.120]  You have to decide whether they're going to be able to crush us and crush your voice
[40:44.120 --> 40:48.880]  and all your investment over the years in the broadcast, but just do not believe them.
[40:48.880 --> 40:53.160]  Well, people either think, Hey, we have all this extra money or they think, Oh, money
[40:53.160 --> 40:57.440]  that goes here goes to the Sandy Hook people because they've got these judgments.
[40:57.440 --> 40:59.920]  We have two years of appeals.
[40:59.920 --> 41:05.080]  And after the end of all that, there's no extra money anyways when you're in a bankruptcy.
[41:05.080 --> 41:09.600]  So it's all a lie, but that's why the lawyers got up in Connecticut and said, Don't buy
[41:09.600 --> 41:13.240]  his products and don't donate because he's a bad bet.
[41:13.240 --> 41:17.200]  We're going to get all the money knowing that psychological warfare.
[41:17.200 --> 41:23.140]  They have top PR firms and then spooks advising them spies that tell them we're going to get
[41:23.140 --> 41:24.140]  the money.
[41:24.140 --> 41:25.920]  Tell them resistance is futile.
[41:25.920 --> 41:30.080]  Tell them he's got extra money, put all those lies out and hope different groups believe
[41:30.080 --> 41:31.080]  the lies.
[41:31.080 --> 41:33.080]  Don't believe a word they say.
[41:33.080 --> 41:34.080]  Believe me.
[41:34.080 --> 41:35.080]  I've told you the truth.
[41:35.080 --> 41:36.080]  I've never lied to you.
[41:36.080 --> 41:39.000]  I've made mistakes, but I've never lied to you.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.400]  I've gotten so neurotic about never lying that when I got pulled over two years ago and
[41:43.400 --> 41:46.680]  the police officer said, the sheriff said, if you've been drinking, I said, Yeah, I had
[41:46.680 --> 41:49.480]  a half bottle of one an hour ago at a Japanese restaurant.
[41:49.480 --> 41:55.560]  He said, you're arrested because people say you're a dumbass for not lying.
[41:55.560 --> 42:00.400]  I hadn't lied in years at that point because everybody lies about this or that to your
[42:00.400 --> 42:03.720]  wife or about, you know, you catch yourself in that.
[42:03.720 --> 42:09.400]  I've gotten so into only telling the truth because when you do it, your brain stops trying
[42:09.400 --> 42:12.600]  to think about what you're going to say and stops thinking about the different angles
[42:12.600 --> 42:16.960]  of stuff and then you just remove deception and then your brain works way faster and is
[42:16.960 --> 42:18.040]  better.
[42:18.040 --> 42:23.960]  So you can see some can see the fact that I don't tell lies.
[42:23.960 --> 42:27.920]  As like dumb, we'll see why.
[42:27.920 --> 42:28.920]  Why do you think that?
[42:28.920 --> 42:32.520]  And I understand the military or war to use deception and things and that's different,
[42:32.520 --> 42:34.600]  but we don't do that, folks.
[42:34.600 --> 42:35.600]  We don't do that.
[42:35.600 --> 42:38.400]  I mean, I've been advised by a lot of high level people that have been really effective
[42:38.400 --> 42:39.400]  and smart and things.
[42:39.400 --> 42:43.000]  They said, Jones, you got to stop telling the truth, your policy of truth really hurt
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  you.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.440]  You know, you got to, you got to lie some and I just, I'm not doing it.
[42:46.440 --> 42:48.360]  I'm trusting in God and that's it.
[42:48.360 --> 42:49.760]  So you got the truth here.
[42:49.760 --> 42:50.920]  That's what you're getting.
[42:50.920 --> 42:54.240]  They can have all their lives over there on the other side, but we got a lot of great
[42:54.240 --> 42:55.240]  products in infowarsstore.com.
[42:55.240 --> 42:58.240]  We have the three new products from Infowars Platinum.

[45:59.040 --> 46:05.680]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen day by day counting
[46:05.680 --> 46:12.520]  these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[46:12.520 --> 46:18.760]  when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day and that's the problem
[46:18.760 --> 46:25.720]  and everything changed after COVID-19, they illegally changed state elections, mailing
[46:25.720 --> 46:30.760]  ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[46:30.760 --> 46:35.320]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election, we're in a serious country when we have elections
[46:35.320 --> 46:39.880]  that can be stolen like this and I believe that just like I believe the election was
[46:39.880 --> 46:45.600]  stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that and it is so absurd for the media and
[46:45.600 --> 46:51.680]  the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that
[46:51.680 --> 46:55.280]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[46:55.280 --> 47:00.960]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[47:00.960 --> 47:29.960]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:29.960 --> 47:37.960]  You see when you stop telling lies, you stop lying to yourself, it's a drug, it's a really
[47:37.960 --> 47:44.800]  good thing, it's empowering and that's why I've not been as effective as I could have
[47:44.800 --> 47:48.400]  been because I haven't done the work I'm supposed to do and that's my fault.
[47:48.400 --> 47:52.200]  Let me explain that, I'll get back to the news, we're talking about the future of
[47:52.200 --> 47:57.880]  infall wars that is in your hands, I knew I didn't have these hundreds of millions
[47:57.880 --> 48:01.400]  of dollars they lied about and said I had, I knew they had these state courts rigged
[48:01.400 --> 48:06.400]  and controlled who were going to put us into receivership and close the building down,
[48:06.400 --> 48:10.800]  I knew that we were out of money so I declared bankruptcy with free speech systems, I declared
[48:10.800 --> 48:13.320]  it personally to put my cards on the table.
[48:13.320 --> 48:15.480]  Now they're never going to let you see those cards, they're going to misrepresent that's
[48:15.480 --> 48:19.840]  what they do, they're their father the devil.
[48:19.840 --> 48:24.320]  But then trying to work with the people involved when you're in the bankruptcy system to get
[48:24.320 --> 48:30.040]  clear numbers to tell people so I can come to Lizards and say I need in the next three
[48:30.040 --> 48:33.560]  months two million dollars or we won't have enough money to buy product in the future
[48:33.560 --> 48:37.880]  and we'll shut down, that's about the number but I don't say it because I'm trying to get
[48:37.880 --> 48:41.760]  the final accounting so I can come in here and give you a report on air and say here's
[48:41.760 --> 48:47.280]  the report, here's what we're doing, here's our plan to stay on air, we've got a lot
[48:47.280 --> 48:54.200]  of people coming through and a lot of big projects that are almost done that's at super
[48:54.200 --> 48:58.440]  charge what we're doing to keep us on air but you add to this the economy faltering
[48:58.440 --> 49:03.840]  and the interest rates going up everything else I get it and if God's ready to change
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.400]  the future of info wars and to put us through more tribulations that's fine I don't blame
[49:08.400 --> 49:13.960]  God I'm just saying God works through you and you have to make the decision or not whether
[49:13.960 --> 49:16.960]  you want to keep this broadcast on air so here's what I'm going to say and I want the
[49:16.960 --> 49:20.680]  crew to watch this and listen to this because they haven't heard this and I don't want rumors
[49:20.680 --> 49:26.440]  about this anywhere another media will misrepresent it here's what I'm saying I don't jerk people's
[49:26.440 --> 49:32.240]  shame but have you ever watched a football game people always ask me what football team
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.880]  do you like and I don't have time to watch football I rarely do but back when I was a
[49:36.880 --> 49:44.120]  fan of it I never really wore the jerseys or rooted for a team I like the playoffs and
[49:44.120 --> 49:49.000]  I like the best teams playing and I wanted to see a good game and I wanted games that
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.320]  were close and interesting or a game where people came from way behind those are the
[49:55.320 --> 50:01.120]  best games so you hear me the last four years in this game of life this most important issue
[50:01.120 --> 50:05.640]  saying if we don't get funds we're going to shut down that's not crying wolf it's like
[50:05.640 --> 50:10.520]  a football game where you sit down with your pizza or your barbecue with the family or
[50:10.520 --> 50:16.600]  friends and the game starts and it is just a battle high scoring low scoring doesn't
[50:16.600 --> 50:20.520]  matter it's close the whole time you're on the edge of your seat that's what this game
[50:20.520 --> 50:27.280]  has been God has done this God God in the last four years has literally kept us right
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.840]  there on the edge of red and black and every time I go well God that's it I'm gonna have
[50:31.840 --> 50:38.920]  to start shutting down boom money comes in but it is nail biting it is torture and it's
[50:38.920 --> 50:42.800]  all in God's plan but if you look at the numbers because we got clear numbers in the past not
[50:42.800 --> 50:50.320]  not coming up the future yet it is crazy how it's like a football game where we're tied
[50:50.320 --> 50:57.520]  in super high scoring throughout the entire four quarters and now we're in overtime and
[50:57.520 --> 51:03.800]  so that's basically how this works now I know and I'm not gonna do this because I still
[51:03.800 --> 51:08.120]  kind of see it as a jerking of chain even though it's not a chain it's the truth and
[51:08.120 --> 51:11.600]  I'm but I'm gonna get my mind wrapped around it and I guess I'm doing that now here on
[51:11.600 --> 51:15.640]  here I love Owen he does incredible job reaches millions of people I love Harrison Smith does
[51:15.640 --> 51:18.800]  an amazing job as well I love this whole crew they're not gonna get let go this month or
[51:18.800 --> 51:25.320]  next month the next month but soon we'll enter a zone where I'll have to tell the crew okay
[51:25.320 --> 51:28.520]  three four months you better start looking for other jobs we're gonna have to start shutting
[51:28.520 --> 51:34.600]  this down that's the process and here's what's sick about it the minute I go okay Owen shroyers
[51:34.600 --> 51:40.240]  let go or Harrison Smith's off the air or no more Greg Reese or no more John bound or
[51:40.240 --> 51:46.720]  no more Derek Green reports that reach millions people a week and are incredible the minute
[51:46.720 --> 51:56.560]  that happens people go oh he's serious this is real and you know how hard it will be if
[51:56.560 --> 52:01.680]  we just shut this place down I just put it into chapter whatever liquidation and I just
[52:01.680 --> 52:09.360]  walk away you know how hard it'll be to fire it back up in the constituted form it's in
[52:09.360 --> 52:14.240]  it'll be hard look I've already got business offers I've already got show offers I can
[52:14.240 --> 52:19.800]  already go do another show for somebody else and have my autonomy and have a whole crew
[52:19.800 --> 52:24.000]  that didn't work for me and it'd be much easier and I'd personally make more money but I don't
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.840]  want them to win I don't want them to shut down our ATX command base I don't want them
[52:27.840 --> 52:31.720]  with all the guests in the history and so much more to offer with the incredible work
[52:31.720 --> 52:38.760]  we're doing to me it's giving up and it's losing to roll over and so you got my commitment
[52:38.760 --> 52:44.360]  that I'm gonna ride this horse till it dies all right that's what I'm gonna do but it
[52:44.360 --> 52:52.960]  is torture absolute torture to not be able to do things and sin crew to things and do
[52:52.960 --> 52:59.080]  things that I know would be huge and to just be in a position of survival but America and
[52:59.080 --> 53:03.160]  the whole world is in a crisis we're all in that position together whether you recognize
[53:03.160 --> 53:08.360]  you're in that position yet or not you are so it's simple we are essential info wars
[53:08.360 --> 53:15.800]  and its mission has been by the grace of God and your support incredible and has had more
[53:15.800 --> 53:23.280]  victories against the enemy than any other operation or team in American history and
[53:23.280 --> 53:30.480]  people tell me that personally foreign presidents top top show host everybody I go out to the
[53:30.480 --> 53:35.480]  store I went to the grocery yesterday with my wife and her mother and I shook 50 hands
[53:35.480 --> 53:40.160]  black white Hispanic old young they said you woke me up you saved my family you told me
[53:40.160 --> 53:43.880]  about the shot and then my dad took it and died but luckily we didn't I mean that that's
[53:43.880 --> 53:50.160]  what's going on here and so we've got so much more important work to do but I will not sit
[53:50.160 --> 53:56.000]  here and spend 20 minutes out of an hour begging you and it's not because it's not because
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.920]  I'm a proud person it's because if you don't see how important this is and you don't realize
[54:01.920 --> 54:06.480]  we're two minutes to midnight then I guess it's God's plan that whatever's gonna happen
[54:06.480 --> 54:13.320]  is gonna happen and maybe I've done my work in fact I'm strongly considering if info
[54:13.320 --> 54:23.120]  war shuts down I don't even know if I'm gonna take a hiatus or what it is but to me I see
[54:23.120 --> 54:28.640]  that as God doesn't want me to do this anymore maybe you've been warned maybe I've already
[54:28.640 --> 54:34.680]  said it all maybe once you never see me again everything I said before is gonna be that much
[54:34.680 --> 54:38.680]  more powerful and that's that's really where I'm at ladies and gentlemen but I'm gonna
[54:38.680 --> 54:44.520]  do more shows I'm gonna be here because I'm a fighter and I don't know how to give up
[54:44.520 --> 54:49.920]  but I gotta tell you there's all this big money out there sitting on the sidelines not
[54:49.920 --> 54:53.560]  supporting us there's all the new vorice out there that's gonna lose everything you got
[54:53.560 --> 54:57.480]  but you want to sit there on the sidelines and pretend you're safe and we're gonna lose
[54:57.480 --> 55:06.600]  everything in that process so we have things you need you know I'm told there's only four
[55:06.600 --> 55:10.800]  hundred signed books left at the warehouse and we can get some more and do more assignments

[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:35.680]  on twitter sums up the latest horror story of our time a newborn baby boy named alex
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:44.840]  was born in washington state with a 95% survivable congenital heart defect he was also anemic
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:52.800]  and he needed a blood transfusion in 2021 little alex's parents had a close friend die
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:02:00.400]  of a heart attack shortly after she received her COVID-19 vaccine by all accounts their
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:07.960]  friend was healthy and her death caused alarm bells to go off about the safety of the mRNA
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:15.400]  vaccine because of this experience they wanted to make sure that young baby alex had unvaccinated
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.920]  blood for his transfusion so they found a match through a member at their church and
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:27.400]  they paid to have the proper protocol take place for alex to receive that donor's blood
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:33.000]  however when it came time for the hospital to initiate the transfusion the doctors and
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.320]  nurses claimed they were unable to locate the unvaccinated donor's blood the parents
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:45.600]  had procured so without the parents consent they took blood from the hospital's general
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:53.200]  stockpile the doctors and nurses assured the parents that baby alex would be fine and told
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:03:02.120]  them babies rarely if ever get blood clots shortly after the transfusion baby alex developed
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:10.040]  a large blood clot the blood clot ran from his knee all the way up to his heart the hospital
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:17.160]  changed their tune saying babies get blood clots all the time and this was normal baby

[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:32.560]  the blood clot didn't dissipate at all just 12 days later alex sadly passed away as a
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:40.320]  result of a blood clot and now the sacred heart children's hospital that killed him
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:47.600]  claims there's no record of baby alex being at the hospital despite ample evidence including

[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:17.840]  possibility that hospital workers may have disobeyed the government and used clean unvaccinated
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:25.160]  blood for will surgery one can only hope that eventually people will start standing up against
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:31.480]  this mass murder and the sooner the better because young innocent children like alex
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:37.520]  are being murdered in hospitals all over the world and these monsters are still pushing

[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:38.840]  health shows let's let's let's talk facts here there is nothing more frustrating than
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:44.080]  having the senate reports than having all the documents and having the state police investigations
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:51.960]  in arizona texas you name it where they admit that millions of underage children have been
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:56.720]  smuggled in the last few years under biden say what you want about trump and he almost
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:01.440]  completely ended it and there are caravans of hundreds of thousands of weeks slamming
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:10.560]  in tens of thousands per group the places like el paso texas where they now report 14500
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:16.480]  a day coming into the city alone now i have this headline i run all the time emergency
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:22.120]  broadcast if you go back 15 20 years ago i would say emergency broadcast maybe once
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:28.040]  a year how like drudge would put up the red siren when something's really big but as
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:34.560]  the crises intensify half the time the headline is emergency broadcast tonight it says emergency
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:39.440]  broadcast because even the top globalist kissinger says we're about to have nuclear war with russia
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:44.040]  the peace deal isn't done it's escalating into nuclear war the u.s. is greenland attacks
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:54.440]  inside russia with missiles has been going on for three weeks so you have the lockdowns
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:59.640]  for two plus years in the third world it totally collapses if you go back 10 years ago the
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:05.920]  u.n. advertised to africans and to middle easters and others if you can get to europe
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:12.920]  everything's going to be paid for everything is going to be free and the very same non-governmental
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:21.520]  organizations that ran the operations in europe the very companies have been hired by biden
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:28.760]  two years ago to run the sectors on the 2300 mile border between the united states and
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:46.360]  mexico on our southern border think about that and let that sink in and so now what
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:53.560]  are the deep state democrats do as their cities like dc and new york and denver get flooded
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:09:02.960]  and people like what the hell is this the red crosses overwhelmed the local charities
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:09.040]  overwhelmed the mayors get up and say it's the republicans fault they broke the border
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:14.520]  that's what the press secretary said last week and put the clip on thursday and we just
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.080]  need to totally get rid of the border to fix this problem and we need more money we don't
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:24.400]  have money for our homeless people are vets but we're supposed to have money for 10 plus
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.400]  million people a year the last two years and now they're saying with title 42 going away
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.880]  next week it's going to be five times worse they're talking about 50 million you know
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:38.360]  that's a crazy number the u.n.'s replacement migration program talked about collapsing
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:43.400]  the third world a decade ago organizing the u.n. refugee centers and moving the people
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:52.920]  up from africa and from areas of asia in the middle east and from other parts of the world
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:10:00.120]  into north america and into the u.s. so here's the headlines el paso mayor declared state
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:08.120]  of emergency over border crisis new york city declares emergency over migrant crisis denver
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:14.120]  mayor declares emergency says city on verge of reaching breaking point of an influx of
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:22.200]  illegal immigrants and they've got an answer more federal funding which the democrats skim
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:27.440]  the money off of and then they give them jobs on top of their welfare checks and the democrats
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.280]  steal that it's all on record so i've done special reports i've been in the border many
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:41.560]  times we've we've listed the u.n. NGO you look it up running the texas border you go there
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:47.080]  and it's all a bunch of soros purple and green and blue haired liberals telling the border
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:52.040]  patrol what to do with these giant migrant centers on the border they're in charge they're
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:57.120]  the bosses they're violating all the laws they're giving little kids the way to people
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.560]  with no IDs all of its human smuggling all of its felonies and they're just doing it
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:09.360]  out of the open in front of everybody just like they do everything else criminal so
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.600]  i've pointed out to governor Abbott and others here on air and i've asked listeners to point
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:23.720]  it out to them that what are you doing you have state grand juries you know we always
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.800]  show this footage it's not even the bad footage we have footage of unaccompanied children
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.880]  being handed over to strangers into cars trains and buses we have footage i mean it just goes
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.680]  on and on just don't even show any of it we're not we're not gonna show the hardcore stuff
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:49.760]  it's fine you know just whatever it's just it's all it's just you know so
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.160]  you know the one thing info wars is not good at the life show cruise great we have all this
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:05.720]  other crew is compilations of all the incredible stuff we've shot and things we've done
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:14.960]  and just like like like how horrific it is but but i digress so now we have texas governor
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:25.680]  Abbott seek state probe of ngo's 80 illegal immigrants crossing border it's felonies why
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.640]  hasn't the state police the texas rangers why haven't the grand juries went forward
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:37.600]  because almost every city and major town in texas has george soros district attorneys
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.960]  and county attorneys and judges and they love it and they like it project veritas weeks
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:51.360]  ago exposed child sex traffic from the border up into dallas up into austin into houston
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:55.360]  and the rest of the country six-year-old saying yeah i don't know these people are i live
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:01.280]  with they make me have sex with people will you save me and nobody's coming to save you
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:14.960]  because the fbi loves it the democratic party loves it the ngo's and the law firms they
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:22.240]  love it they think it's funny and cute god knows where these children are going ladies
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:30.000]  and gentlemen but we have the footage at the airports where the same woman all day goes
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.280]  to the migrant center takes the newborn babies and six little babies and then she goes it's
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:42.720]  my baby and with no paperwork hands it over to ngo's and the babies just disappear and
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:48.480]  weird creepy men pulling up in vans and they just hand them little kids six seven eight
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:54.000]  year old girls and boys and they just drive off with them oh but when you come back from
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.240]  a trip to europe or cancun mexico anywhere oh let me check your passport let me run it
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.000]  let me ask you questions and make sure you are who you say you are but when they're doing
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.480]  it on this scale we just sit there and we take it so all the border states and other
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:15.000]  states have laws against this this is all incredibly illegal you know my sister's adopted
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.320]  my mother couldn't have children after me she got the dalcon shield contraceptive that
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:26.120]  was actually a sterile and she won a lawsuit against them that's a side issue hundreds
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:31.000]  of thousands of women dead in the class action lawsuit so we adopted my sister from South
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:37.880]  Korea it took two years and a whole bunch of red tape and hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.560]  to make sure we were a good family to make sure it was all taken care to make sure she
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.400]  wasn't taken from another family there was a woman wanting to give up a child and that's
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:52.560]  my sister and I love her she's great all that vetting to adopt my sister but zero when
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:58.880]  they just hand these children off and this mass crime is committed we go down there three
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:04.240]  years ago two years ago a year ago and there'd be total corporate media control word twitter
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:11.600]  facebook instagram google would not let one bombshell insane video that we got a crime
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:16.480]  of smuggled children coming out and the good corporate media worked together and they didn't
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.120]  release it but you know who else didn't oh you don't you don't share an info or sleep
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.680]  you might get censored oh you don't promote Alex Jones link you might criticize so the
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:32.760]  general public didn't promote those videos the general public nudist that's not kosher
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:37.840]  you just don't go there so now the general public has aided and abetted the kidnapping
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:49.600]  and smuggling of children ladies and gentlemen so that's where we are but at least now they're
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.920]  talking about criminal investigations and grand juries because I mean it's open and shut
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:16:01.840]  just start arresting these people and they'll all fall like dominoes I have been in a twenty
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:08.840]  eight year marathon battle with a globalist I have come from nowhere to the very heights
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:14.840]  of politics not just in America but the world we are engaging the globalist at point-blank
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:21.080]  range in the information war but I don't deserve the credit yes I've persevered but the listeners
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:26.600]  and viewers who support them for the real reason we've had this success we're having
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:32.960]  now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had we are now entering
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:39.280]  the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than ever realize
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:43.200]  how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing

[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:08.400]  cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:15.440]  because of something called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.280]  course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:28.360]  people was a lack of vitamin D3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:33.920]  vitamin D3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.560]  it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:42.160]  over so now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality

[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:59.720]  you're bad and so yes I'm calling for the head of the main NGO down in south texas
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.960]  to be arrested for human trafficking they've done it they organized it they paid people
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.840]  they knew that kidnapped kids to do it arrest them we have a bunch of politically correct
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:15.040]  sold out people who aren't part of the trafficking themselves who just go along with it so it
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:21.920]  is good that governor abbots finally talking about this because if he doesn't do something
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:27.660]  about it he's guilty of it as well texas governor abbots seek state probe of NGOs
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:36.600]  aiding illegal immigrants crossings they're aiding the crime that violates federal crime
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:47.120]  and now we have a state of emergency we are in a major emergency we are in an intense
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:55.680]  emergency and then we've got all this news court rules against biological females over
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:02.840]  connecticut transgender athlete policy gates and bezos invest in australian designed brain
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:09.440]  implant i'm going to get to that an electric car charging twice as expensive new study
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:17.880]  i'll get to that next segment but let's go to this right now because there's a great
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:28.000]  report here that really needs to be aired this is neil oliver based out of scotland
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.120]  who does a great job and he talks about how you have mps members of parliament coming
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:38.640]  out with government whistleblowers that know that the shots create blood clots and kill
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:43.120]  people and erase your immune system and when the member of parliament's there speaking warning
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.720]  no one's there to even listen to him and the media doesn't pick it up again we're signed
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:52.040]  on to our destruction do you think it's not going to get worse if we don't wake up and
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:59.880]  say no we're not going along with this there's part of that report what is being alleged
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:04.920]  about the so-called vaccines is of monumental importance what bridgen and malhotra have
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:10.000]  claimed ought to be the biggest story in the country in the world and yet anyone interested
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.600]  in familiarizing themselves with most of what was said has to go looking for it online bridgen
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:21.040]  noted withdrawals of those other medical products when their safety was credibly questioned that's
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:25.880]  the world I thought we lived in we're doubt voiced in the face of credible research leads
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:31.200]  to the pausing of a course of action and a rethink and yet here we are with peer reviewed
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.160]  research demonstrating one in every hundred people receiving the Pfizer jab suffers a serious
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:41.800]  reaction and medical professionals of unimpeachable credentials are doing at least a pause in the
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:47.480]  rollout if not a full and final stop and still the government sponsored adverts are everywhere
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:52.520]  in the mainstream and online inviting people of all ages to take even more of the same
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:58.840]  product doctor malhotra said on this channel last week in relation to the Pfizer jab quote
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:03.600]  the original trial data which was reanalyzed suggested one was more likely to get serious
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:09.480]  adverse effects from the vaccine than one was to be hospitalized with covid what does
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:15.000]  that mean it means if that is correct which it seems to be it should never have been approved
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.160]  in the first place questions have been asked all over the world about blood clotting and
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.880]  any possible connection with the AstraZeneca product countries across Europe have stopped
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.160]  using it and it's no longer being given to people under 30 in the UK it's worth noting
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:35.760]  that on Wednesday Pascal Sorio chief executive officer of AstraZeneca was knighted by King
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:41.520]  Charles for services to life sciences in a ceremony at Windsor Castle all around the
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:46.480]  world there is mounting evidence of deaths and injuries caused by the so-called vaccines
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:52.040]  there are more and more excess deaths people of all ages dying every day deaths unrelated
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:57.840]  to covid pause for a moment to consider the following in the United States in the second
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:04.720]  half of 2021 61,000 Americans between the ages of 25 and 44 died of causes unrelated
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:12.400]  to covid the death toll of the same age group during the decade-long Vietnam War was 58,000
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.080]  here in the UK at the start of the lockdown in 2020 in the week ending 23rd of March
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:25.040]  there were 1,379 excess deaths in the week ending 21st October this year the figure
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:33.360]  was 1,822 there are more people dying every week now of causes unrelated to covid than
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.040]  at the height of the pandemic daily we were invited to look on in horror at the covid
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:43.600]  death toll where is the outrage about these latest deaths the round the clock coverage
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:49.360]  Dr. John Campbell a regular contributor to this channel said last month in relation to
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:54.920]  the ONS data regarding those excess deaths there is something pretty horrible going
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:01.240]  on over 1,800 deaths a week more than we would expect and it's been going on for a long time
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:06.680]  now and we need an explanation what we get instead is the relentless continuation of
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.560]  the rollout the push to get boosted Fauci in the US and others here in the UK say we're
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:17.600]  still in a pandemic if that's true it's the longest lasting pandemic in modern history
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.800]  much longer than the Spanish flu pandemic at the end of the first world war the concern
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:27.200]  being voiced now by Bridgen and Malhotra has been being shouted from the rooftops by many
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.480]  many others for years for as long as we've had the products marketed as vaccines that
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.760]  have been voices asking questions and those were silenced derided ridiculed reputations
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:45.880]  ruined back in 1995 US physicist Carl Sagan demanded restless inquiry from all scientists
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:50.600]  science requires an almost complete openness to all ideas he said on the other hand it
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:56.120]  requires the most rigorous and uncompromising skepticism and so how did we get to where
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:02.160]  we are now when did we set aside uncompromising skepticism and decide to live in a world in
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:06.520]  which we must all of us do precisely what we're told by our governments and their preferred
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:11.800]  experts without ever raising so much as a questioning voice the chamber in which Bridgen
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:16.680]  made his speech was all but empty because with a few exceptions apparently none of the
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:20.920]  rest cared to listen to what he had to say about a course of action affecting tens of
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:26.920]  millions of lives here in the UK and billions around the world let's give the devil is due
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:31.640]  let's imagine many are daily in receipt of messages raising the alarm but find the survival
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.640]  in the world of politics means they keep stoop rather than rock the boat I hear from other
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:41.640]  journalists saying they're in contact with MPs with medical professionals with high profile
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.840]  media types all of whom have decided now to stay well clear of the so-called vaccines
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:52.040]  some of those people have taken some jabs some none but the fear of speaking out the culture
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:56.840]  of silence in the face of what so many know to be an egregious wrong is enabling the narrative
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:02.360]  to persist largely unchallenged the behavior of governments and corporations in the last
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:07.160]  two or three years has changed the world it might still look the same more or less but
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:12.080]  in all the ways that matter it has been altered those who are awake to it all perceive a new
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:16.680]  reality and wonder how on earth they missed the signs for as long as they did that all
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:21.280]  but empty house of commons said loud and clear that the powers that be the allied powers
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.200]  of governments and corporations no longer feel the need to be answerable in any meaningful
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:31.640]  way to the people paradoxically their absence from the chamber only made them more glaringly
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:37.360]  visible the willful blindness about the vaccines is just the tip of the iceberg soaring excess
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:43.120]  deaths in all age groups the complicated truth of the war in Ukraine still not openly discussed
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:47.200]  the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world the wholesale erosion of our
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.160]  rights the nudge away from cash and towards central bank digital

[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:25.760]  look trump would always say it was totally true he said they're not coming after me they're coming
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:32.560]  after you i'm just standing in their way that's totally true my best defense for my family is to
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:37.600]  save america save the world promote liberty and defeat the globalists running off and hiding is
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:44.320]  not an option but we're rapidly going into that position so i'm not going to lie to you there's
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:48.800]  a huge awakening we've got a big chance to beat these people but folks can't become comfortable
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:56.480]  with the imploded borders with the pedophilia with the wars with the gmo with all of it you've
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:03.680]  got to start getting upset you've got to get angry you've got to say no to it so the european union
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.080]  is basically a new communist super state run by the globalists they're fascist above it but they
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:14.480]  use communism for control and they've come out put the headline on screen and said anybody flying to
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:20.800]  europe or by boat or any other way you're going to pay a carbon tax just to come to europe not a
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:26.640]  very legal alien of course european union reaches agreement to force everyone in EU countries to
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:33.680]  pay for co2 emissions first step a personal carbon credit and anyone coming to the EU to pay the tax
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:39.760]  as well spend a whole show on that as if carbon's bad for the planet when carbon's what makes the
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:45.840]  planet live it's what creates the surface of the earth and the environment for plants and animals
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:52.880]  to thrive now you want to bring in something you got total control over this life is something bad
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:58.320]  and now you can regulate it but here's the good news they have to suppress info wars
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:04.720]  and my guest host and my shelf and our great crew and our reports and everything because they're
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:11.920]  wildly popular they admit that they have to move heaven and earth to suppress us and spend billions
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:16.720]  of dollars just to suppress this broadcast with all the hundreds of thousands of articles and
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:23.040]  thousands of shows and programs and hbo and nbc and abc and new york times everything attacks us
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:29.040]  because we're we're not psychotic we're not selling out to this devilish system they'll destroy us
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:39.440]  anyways we're not dead inside and so they spent reportedly a hundred million dollars shooting
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:43.600]  and promoting and advertising you saw it everywhere aoc's movie
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:54.400]  just like cnn spent 450 plus million dollars some estimates are 500 million on cnn plus
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:02.400]  and they had like 2 000 viewers on average any one time obama gives a speech to have 5 000 views on
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:08.560]  youtube somebody lets me on their show 2 million views with them suppressing it so it's not about
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:14.400]  bragging oh hey we're really popular it's saying the public is not dead yet they know the truth
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:27.120]  so here's fox news aoc climate change documentary earns 80 dollars per theater it huge millions of
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:34.480]  dollars in advertisement huge budget for saying it's up to a hundred million dollars 80 dollars
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:48.160]  per theater 10 000 dollars in a week nationwide 10 000 dollars so so so they spend millions and
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.440]  millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions dollars and no one goes
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:37:01.600]  and watches it so yeah those of us standing up we're under attack is what we're saying is true
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:07.360]  and it's popular and if we're allowed to keep doing this we'll win i go back to that internet
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:12.240]  saying nobody knows who said it but the propaganda wouldn't be necessary if the situation was hopeless
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:21.520]  it's far from that but people have to get how do or die this is all my demonization all the attacks
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:28.240]  i'm more popular than ever on the street but the algorithms and the ai is censoring us and crushing
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:34.800]  us down so our popular message of defeating this can't get out this is your war this is our war
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.520]  she puts out a documentary
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.800]  with a budget in the tens of millions of dollars they run tens of millions of dollars of advertising
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:58.560]  they get promoted on every channel and they can't get 10 people in every movie theater
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:07.280]  they got eight people in the average movie theater with all that promotion because people
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:21.360]  don't buy it people don't want it but it's force fed so that's a microcosm of what we're dealing with
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:28.960]  and that's why they force idiocy that's why they force oxymoronic garbage with no logic
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:36.160]  that's not common sense in wrestling and in cycling and in swimming and in basketball and
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:43.200]  every other great sport where people go to learn to compete and power themselves they go and you're
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:49.440]  you're a girl that's in the finals and you've already beaten over a hundred other girls and
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:54.720]  you're 15 years old and you're at the state finals and you walk out there for your wrestling
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:04.720]  match and there's a biological male who breaks your arm and they sit there and laugh because
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:12.400]  they want to sell absurdity to see what they can get away with and of course it's Connecticut
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:19.600]  so liberal so loving so trendy oh we're gonna let guys play basketball against girls
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:24.800]  we're gonna let guys be in the boxing classes we're gonna let guys go in their
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.360]  showers because if we can do that we can do
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:35.440]  anything there's thousands of cases to see in the news every few days but remember one a few
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:43.680]  months ago where a convicted pedophile at an Asian spa a South Korean spa where women go
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.160]  with their mothers their grandmothers their kids and they go get their facials and they
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:52.800]  work out and they go get in hot tubs and they steam and a dude comes in and starts jacking off
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:40:00.880]  right in front of them and the news is like well he's a woman he's allowed to again it's all about
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:10.560]  what can they get away with court rules against biological females over Connecticut transgender
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:16.800]  athlete policy a three judge appellate panel same one that let the fraudulent trials against me go
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:22.720]  forward on Friday dismissed a challenge to Connecticut's transgender athlete policy as a group
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:29.200]  of biological females said it was unfair that they have to race against biological males who
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:36.480]  identify as female in the decision of the second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York appell
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.880]  the lower court judges dismissal of a lawsuit challenging the policy brought by four female
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:46.880]  runners opposing letting transgender athletes compete in high school sports from swimming to
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.200]  track to basketball according to the judges the girls lack standing to sue
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:00.400]  saying the fact that they were denied scholarships for biological males speculative
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:07.280]  how's that empowering women and our daughters to not let them get scholarships
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:17.760]  so some dude that went and beat them up gets it here's another one oh it's not just the race
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:23.200]  for brain implants with old Elon Musk hanging out with Jared Kushner over at the world cup
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:31.600]  gates and bezos invest in australian designed brain implant billionaires bill gates just
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:39.040]  bezos are betting on a new york base synchron to answer to elan mussel's neuro length
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:46.240]  but they're carrying out in australia found by australian professors tom oxley and nick op the

[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:37.920]  including norway because it's not meant to replace the cars it's meant to ban the cars that work
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:42.560]  and give you cars that don't to end the average person having a car i've been saying that for
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:49.280]  years but now claus wabbs said last week we are getting rid of personal cause we have decided

[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:17.680]  we are engaging the globalist at point blank range in the information war but i don't deserve
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:24.000]  the credit yes i've persevered but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason

[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:15.920]  that's what they want to take away your ability to speak freely so they're going to go from
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:19.280]  michael indel next or they're going to go for steve bannon or they're going to go for tucker
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:24.320]  carlson i studied the globalist 30 years ago but on air 28 years and i knew they were planning all
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.640]  of this and i warned the public as a modern paul revere but i couldn't have done it without your
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.720]  support and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet not just

[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:05.680]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:17.600]  final segment of the orange jones show sunday edition
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:23.680]  i had a vogue shroyer taking over here in about 13 minutes with sunday live
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:26.400]  6 to 8 p.m central standard time
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:36.800]  all right i want to talk about before i hit this final news what they don't want
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:43.200]  the power structure doesn't want independent media when they stage terror attacks or they lie
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:48.080]  about wmds or they stage a mass shooting or whatever it is they do they don't want somebody
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:53.280]  watching and calling them out when it happens that changes the narrative they want narrative control
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:59.520]  by the general public now i've studied 9 11 that happened 20 plus years ago probably more than
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:04.800]  anybody out there other than those that did it we're not saying radicalism doesn't exist we're
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:09.040]  not saying that bin laden wasn't a real person we're saying there were criminal elements in our
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:15.360]  government aiding and abetting at many levels and that the chance filled plane was shot down and that
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:19.680]  there was a plane that they were trying to send to the capital and that the witnesses all saw a
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:26.720]  cruise missile get the pentagon and no wreckage and even cnn reported that but see they can easily
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:31.600]  cover that up if nobody's calling it out they can sleep under the rug like that day that afternoon
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:37.520]  i've been on air since it happened early in the morning i want a pizza it was a pizza place like
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:42.720]  two miles from my house i got in the car and i drove to pizza place to pick the pizza up i'd order
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:48.640]  and i listened to cbs radio back when they still had cbs radio went away like a year later
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.240]  and they said the decision has been made to blow up with a controlled demolition building 7
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:59.600]  and they're going to blow it up in five minutes so i go back on air and i go i heard them on
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.320]  air so they're going to blow up building 7 and back then they didn't web archive stuff and i said
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:13.200]  that people thought i was crazy but years later they released cnn vbc npr cbs newscast saying
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:17.920]  we've blown up building 7 to protect the other buildings and they called it conspiracy theory
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:22.960]  but we have the clips now you can find those clips they don't want that to exist they want to be able
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:28.480]  to gaslight you for whatever really happened on 9 11 so you never ask those questions so here's a
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:35.840]  clip from the past with the cnn reporter saying he saw no plane hit the building here it is on cnn's
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:41.200]  military affairs correspondent jamie macintar and jamie you got very close to where that plane went
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:46.800]  down that's right judy a short uh a while ago i walked right up to next to the building was uh
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:51.040]  firefighters were still trying to put out the blaze the fire by the way is still burning in
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:56.560]  some parts of the pentagon and i took a look at the huge gaping hole that's in this sideway but
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:02.720]  from my close-up inspection there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the pentagon
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:08.320]  the only site is the actual side of the building that's crashed in and as i said the only pieces
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:13.600]  left uh that you can see are are small enough that you could pick up in your hand uh there are no
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:23.360]  large tail sections wing sections uh fuselage nothing nothing nothing to indicate a plane nothing
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:28.720]  to indicate a plane hit now do we know exactly what happened no but we know we're being lied to i
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:35.360]  could show you 10 clips bbc had five of them saying yeah we're they're blowing the building up i talked
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:41.040]  to cops who weren't involved the media spun like jonesus cops blew it up no they were there and heard
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:50.000]  the 10 second countdown by the red cross yeah the red cross that's cia front group so ladies and
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.960]  gentlemen this is what we're talking about and that's why they don't want us on air so they can
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:00.800]  do whatever they want whenever they want however they want and we won't have memories and be able
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:06.000]  to call it up when biden said when i get elected surge the border we're getting rid of the us border
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:11.520]  now he's like i'm controlling the border the border is just fine why there's not an emergency
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:16.880]  we're just going to legalize everybody we have him saying he broke it they don't want that clip
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:22.960]  seen that we planned it friday so we can find it so that's what they hate about this show
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:30.320]  is that we're reminding people that have forgotten and got caught up on what's going on
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:34.320]  what was said a few years before here's the clip of uh biden
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:41.680]  proud to have served with him what i would do as president is several more things because things
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:48.080]  have changed i would in fact make sure that there is we immediately served to the border all those
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:53.120]  people are seeking asylum they deserve to be heard that's who we are we're a nation says if you want
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:59.840]  to flee and you're fleeing oppression you should come but they said last week the border's controlled
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:06.720]  he did not say come here but you saw it see they don't want us here to call them out that's all we
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:13.840]  do we're not heroic we're just like you we're sick of lies but we're working for you we belong to you
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:20.240]  we are fighting for you because we have similar interests we care about justice and freedom that's
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:24.960]  why you got to take the live show links tonight on your email and your text message why you got to
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:29.440]  tell random people tune into info wars dot com because they don't let it be promoted anywhere
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:35.200]  online you've got to go to the site and tell others when you tell them go to the site that they
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:39.600]  should tell others to go to the site and tell them to go to the site that's how we get around the
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:46.320]  censorship that's how we don't give up that's how we win and we're so close they have grand juries open
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:51.200]  to indict the un with the open borders in texas and grand juries in florida for the poison shots
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:58.400]  and the world's waking up we're kicking their ass but with our hands tied behind our backs
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:05.680]  we could do so much more together now look at this out of norway and it's the same here
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:12.480]  in the studies it takes four times the carbon to make an electric car on on on average on average
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:17.840]  the electric car does not start using less carbon till 60 000 miles but it doesn't matter
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:25.200]  because carbon's good and makes the atmosphere but it's twice as expensive now and in places
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:30.080]  like california they're saying don't charge your car today there's not enough power they're not getting
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:35.360]  rid of gas cars to replace them they're getting rid of all the cars for the general public as claus
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:40.160]  swab said two weeks ago we're getting rid of private ownership of cars you'll own nothing
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:46.400]  and you'll like it remember that electric car charging twice as expensive as gas in norway
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:52.960]  story by kit daniels on info wars dot com electric car charging is costing drivers twice as much
